1
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,560
Was there anything in
the newspapers today?

2
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,520
Don't know about Kolkata but...

3
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,400
there was a small story in
today's local newspaper.

4
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,600
I don't think I can do it.-
- Same here.

5
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,600
But the money?

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,560
Don't be scared. They're
coming. Get ready.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,640
Get the evening newspaper
from Robi da's shop.

8
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay.

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,840
Should I come along.-
- Sure.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,400
I'll be back.-
- Go.

11
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,360
I'll go get the bike
out from the stand.

12
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,760
Listen...-
- Yes.

13
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,440
I owe Robi da some
money. Clear the due.

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
Heard me?-
- Yes.

15
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
Master da.-
- Yes.

16
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
Yes, tell me.

17
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,640
What the...-
- Run!

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Kingshuk!

19
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,600
Not my area. My area is
till this side of the dam.

20
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,880
That side is under Dulanpur.-
- I know sir.

21
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,479
But those boys came from this
side, near Bhogibaba's abode...

22
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,960
and said such nasty
things to my daughter...-

23
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,600
Bhogibaba's abode isn't
under my police station.

24
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,880
Go to some
other police station. Okay?

25
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,440
Bhogibaba's abode
isn't under our area!

26
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,480
How many times do I tell you
we can't take the case. Go.

27
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
What do I do then sir?

28
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,480
Mine is a Government job.
Can't do illegal things. Right?

29
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,480
Go to some other
police station. Go now.

30
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,280
This side of the dam
is our area.

31
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,840
There's a black goat tied there,
its left leg is in our area.

32
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,600
Got it?

33
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,480
It happened on the same side of
the goat. Please do something sir.

34
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,520
It was Mr. Ray's
birthday yesterday.

35
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,479
We cut up that goat for
the feast. Now tell me...

36
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,960
the goat itself isn't there,
how to tell which side it was?

37
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,760
They have all teamed
up to stop us. Why?

38
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,880
Because we're thinking
about your development.

39
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,240
The fact that you're happy,
healthy and in peace...

40
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,240
they don't like it. But
for your development...

41
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
we must win.

42
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,480
Hence, in the upcoming
election make us victorious

43
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,960
by voting on the Lantern logo.

44
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
Got it?

45
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
Proshanto.

46
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,560
We shall love, we shall light,
light the lantern, light the lantern!

47
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,760
We shall love, we shall light,
light the lantern, light the lantern!

48
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,840
We shall love, we shall light,
light the lantern, light the lantern!

49
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,760
Don't you dare touch my beer!

50
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,440
Don't touch my beer!

51
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
Nice!

52
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,480
Take her aside.

53
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,560
I need to feel a little light.

54
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Leave me!
Let me go!

55
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,320
Hey!

56
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,320
I'll butcher you
if you begin before me!

57
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,160
Make it fast!

58
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,880
Get up you rascal!

59
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,320
Get up!

60
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Why did you begin before me?

61
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
Now hold her legs!

62
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,640
No! No please!

63
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,920
See, I wasn't there on
spot. But I'm a leader.

64
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,160
I understand everything.

65
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,640
Bhai must've said something
naughty, he's just a kid. Got it?

66
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,360
A kid saying naughty things
doesn't get a girl to a hospital.

67
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,680
He pulled aside my
daughter from the road...

68
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,840
Hey Proshanto,

69
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,119
What did you do
with his daughter?

70
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,200
I?

71
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,880
I didn't do anything.
I don't know anything.

72
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,000
Correct! He
doesn't know anything.

73
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,880
My brother respects women a lot.

74
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,880
He can't do anything.-
- So what Haren says is wrong?

75
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,720
And what his daughter
says is wrong too.

76
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,880
Not wrong. A mistake.

77
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,880
She must have taken things
in a wrong way. Forget it.

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,040
Honey, please come here.

79
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,680
His wife.-
- Bless me God!

80
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,880
Go make me a hot cup of tea.

81
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Go.

82
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,440
If he has such a
sweet wife at home

83
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,040
why would he grab at a road
side girl and get stained?

84
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,880
Right?-
- See Mr. Ashim...

85
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,680
we've come to you for justice
or else the villagers would've

86
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,879
hammered and buried
them into the ground!

87
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,560
You rascal!

88
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,880
Control brother.

89
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,600
What did you say?
Bury my brother?

90
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,440
Bury him then. Bury him here
he'll come up inside your home.

91
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,880
He is an undying monster!

92
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,480
Got it?

93
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,400
Now come on get lost!

94
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,680
Sixty three new religions.-
- Moyna, eat now.

95
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,880
Enough studying.

96
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,080
Let me finish this. Master
da will be here anytime now.

97
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,879
You? What are
you doing here?

98
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,960
Told you I'll come.
Came up your home.

99
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,880
Get out at once!

100
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,760
Too brave aren't you?

101
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
A prescription for the
over smart doctor!

102
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
Why study?

103
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,800
It is better you sleep around!

104
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,560
And whenever you dare,
remember this rape;

105
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,880
and if you open your mouth,
I'll rape you once again!

106
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,480
You must practice
to remember it!

107
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
Now come on hold him!-
- Leave my father!

108
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Try touching her once!
I'll cut you into two pieces!

109
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,760
Cut me into pieces, will you?

110
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
No!

111
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,440
Let her go please!-
- Hey!

112
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,400
Haven't I told you not
to begin before me?

113
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,320
There's hot food inside, go eat.

114
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,600
Surekha is not out of danger.
They're not letting the news out.

115
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,280
At Jaidighi near Dulanpur
another mother and daughter...

116
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,840
How is Moyna now?

117
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,680
None of them are well
Barun da. What will happen?

118
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,280
That is the question.-
- Hey!

119
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,559
How can you keep your cool?
Feel like thrashing their heads!

120
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,960
How will that help?-
- As in?

121
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,120
An eye for an eye will make
the entire nation blind.

122
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,040
We've to walk a different path.
We can take up arms anytime.

123
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,439
But there's no stopping
once we do it.

124
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,480
Oh please! Do
whatever you want!

125
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,480
Master, how much
more can we endure?

126
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,560
Till now they were doing
smuggling and politics.

127
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,760
Now they are getting
into our houses.

128
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,080
We need a proper revolt now!

129
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Revolution has many
languages Nikhil. One, violence.

130
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,679
That animals believe in.
And two, non-violence.

131
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,239
Beholding the truth
through non-violence.

132
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,000
That humans believe in.

133
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,000
And they're believing
you so much! Listen...

134
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,080
This is not Kolkata, where
you teach, this is a village.

135
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,279
You can't give in to the goons
here. Only violence speaks here.

136
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,920
Do we change our belief system
because of what others believe?

137
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,820
Anyone can revolt
through violence!

138
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:02,060
But why should we?

139
00:14:03,124 --> 00:14:07,404
We shall stand against their
violence and look right in their eye!

140
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:12,604
And for that kind of a revolution
we need a platform.

141
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:16,484
A platform we will
ourselves built!

142
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,964
We will call it,
'Platform of Awakening!'

143
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:31,924
Get up! Wake up!
Realise what you deserve!

144
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:34,164
And make others
realise too. A calm...

145
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,564
but stubborn revolution!

146
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:41,004
But none of them are well
Barun da. Surekha, Moyna...

147
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:45,644
None of us are doing
well, Durga. Right?

148
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:49,124
But this is not the
time to shed tears.

149
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:53,764
This is the time to make
fire out of those tears!

150
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:56,604
We need to revolt,
need to fight.

151
00:14:57,204 --> 00:14:59,644
But that, in our own way.

152
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:02,644
Come on!

153
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:09,244
How sad!

154
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:14,644
But what do I do brother?
My hands are tied up.

155
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:17,964
Strange! Earlier all reports
from that area were filed here.

156
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,124
Mr. Ashim, the minister.

157
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:22,604
He has passed a new law.

158
00:15:23,044 --> 00:15:27,004
According to that, those areas
aren't under my police station.

159
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:29,404
But who can inquire, right?

160
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:32,244
Go to another police
station. How sad.

161
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:35,404
Thank you.
Let's go.

162
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:40,484
Told you the area isn't under
our police station. Now go!

163
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:43,004
Tell us where to go.

164
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:45,804
We're suffering because
we're stuck the middle.

165
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,124
You can clearly see
she is in much pain.

166
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:49,964
But what do I do?

167
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:55,524
But if you want, could take that
area under my police station.

168
00:15:55,604 --> 00:15:58,603
Aren't you ashamed?

169
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:01,524
You can't help us anyway,
now you're insulting women?

170
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:06,164
When did I insult you? Fine,
if you don't like it then...

171
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:08,164
leave.

172
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:09,484
Let's go.

173
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:16,724
I understand everything but
nothing can happen today.

174
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:19,004
Today is the Foundation
Day of the police station.

175
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,764
We're always
dealing with criminals.

176
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:24,204
So a get together today...

177
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:26,964
a little fun, frolic and
merry making you see.

178
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:30,964
Yes do that. That is what the
Government is paying you for.

179
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:31,964
Hey!

180
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:34,964
Don't think you've bought us
because we're keeping mum.

181
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:38,404
Lock you up and you'll
know why we get paid.

182
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,204
Let me say something sir.

183
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:45,164
You've got women at home too.
They use the same village roads.

184
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,044
They're animals sir.
When they attack

185
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:52,564
they don't think if it a rickshaw
puller's daughter or a police officer's.

186
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:55,844
Look, you seem intelligent.

187
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:59,764
But even if it has happened
we can't arrest anyone.

188
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:04,204
Because the crime spot-
- Isn't under you?

189
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:07,124
Yes, right Ray?-
- Intelligent boy sir.

190
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:10,564
And who have you accused?
Proshanto Mondol?

191
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:15,724
Oh him! He is not under
any police station.

192
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:18,564
Who has complained against me?

193
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:20,644
Barun Biswas.

194
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:25,524
I'll finish you, you swine!

195
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,044
You think you alone can do that?

196
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:29,364
Threatening me?

197
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:33,764
There is a different
prescription for threats.

198
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:38,284
Different prescription for
women, love them a lot!

199
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:40,883
It is different for men
too. I'll finish you...

200
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,724
Hey!

201
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:46,044
When we left home to
file the complaint,

202
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:48,044
we were prepared
for your reaction.

203
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,484
Now we need to see
which one is stronger.

204
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,724
Your wrath or our endurability.

205
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:55,724
I'll thrash away your
endurability in no time!

206
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:58,043
Mind your language!

207
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:01,684
Holy Cow!
Little Miss Muffet!

208
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:06,043
Why in public, come to my room
to teach me the language!

209
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,004
Speak another word and
I'll tear off your tongue!

210
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,043
You speak a word and I'll tear
off your clothes you bitch!

211
00:18:11,044 --> 00:18:15,444
Dada! Please leave it.
I'll have to hear for this.

212
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:17,284
Police station after all.

213
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:22,524
I realise you all are believers in
physical strength and all that.

214
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:25,644
We don't. We believe
in the will power.

215
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:28,044
Let's see who wins.

216
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:31,644
Hey! I'll kill him!

217
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:34,044
No one comes forward!
No one!

218
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:41,044
Gave you a sample of
the physical strength.

219
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,324
Accepted.

220
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:45,284
Will give you the sample of
will power some other time.

221
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,284
Come on.

222
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:01,044
Continue with
the rehearsal. Bye.

223
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:02,244
Let's go.

224
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:11,644
Respected District Magistrate,

225
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:17,539
Nikhil, drop the letter on the
way to College Street tomorrow.

226
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:20,019
Send it through GPO,
it'll go faster.

227
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:23,175
What do you think Master?
This letter will work?

228
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,348
Earlier too you've sent
letters. Any response?

229
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,973
The change will happen.
Tomorrow, if not today.

230
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,613
If we lose hope like this,
nothing can happen ever.

231
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:32,973
Nothing will ever happen.
Mark my words,

232
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,853
they'll get the letter and
tear it down.

233
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:37,373
It is better we go tear
those monsters down!

234
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:41,013
Which problem will it solve?
Anger can solve no problems.

235
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,671
Like Dada, I too don't
support your ways Master.

236
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:46,351
You endured his slap,
then you'll endure his punches.

237
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,751
They will smash you to the
ground, endure that too?

238
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:51,270
He will!-
- How long like this?

239
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:53,751
Won't we ever be able
to solve any problem?

240
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:57,591
No Durga, Master is right. It is
light that tears the darkness apart.

241
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,711
And one day this darkness
shall disappear for sure!

242
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:03,911
Wait! What did you say? Light
tears the darkness apart?

243
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:07,270
Doesn't it?-
- Of course it does!

244
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:11,231
Sure! And this light shall be our
weapon to cut through the dark.

245
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:14,271
Bye. See you at the temple
tomorrow. Nikhil, drop the letter.

246
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,831
Hey!-
- Err.. what now?

247
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:19,711
Do it then.

248
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,551
You? Everyone's left,
why haven't you?

249
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:37,431
I will.

250
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:41,551
Another letter?

251
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,271
Like Kingshuk said, the
light tears the dark away.

252
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,191
That's what'll will happen here.

253
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:49,911
But we should worry about
punishing them first Barun da.

254
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:52,551
Is there a need to bring
light right now for that?

255
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:56,191
Of course! Always
keep one thing in mind.

256
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,551
A pen is always
mightier than the sword.

257
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:01,271
Where nothing else
works, a pen does.

258
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,751
Think about it. Wherever
we went with our problems

259
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,591
they did nothing,
sat still like statues.

260
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:11,271
If light comes to our village,
people will rethink.

261
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:15,191
They are bound to take us
more seriously. Do you get it?

262
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:20,551
Listen, understand. Only us
thinking about it won't do.

263
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:23,671
We need the villagers
to start thinking too.

264
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:26,631
If light comes here, people
will get some courage.

265
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:30,270
Light will be our first
step to a revolution!

266
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:32,431
Once electricity comes,
people will know,

267
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:35,111
a little effort can
work wonders.

268
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:36,751
It does not need a minister.

269
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:40,231
All it needs is a human
being's genuine effort.

270
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:44,751
But I worry for you, Barun da.-
- Why worry?

271
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:47,311
They're not good people,
they can harm you.

272
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,511
You can't afford to worry if
you're doing something big.

273
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:53,351
I don't worry about
myself at all.

274
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:55,591
But I do.

275
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:01,271
Don't worry. Just be
with me. That's enough.

276
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:48,270
Come along everybody
Come, let's learn to fly

277
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:53,151
A silver clad day has arrived

278
00:22:55,431 --> 00:23:00,271
So many hues shower
into the lap of the night

279
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:05,311
All of them splurging around!

280
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:12,231
Smiles spread across faces
Like hopes awaken in hearts

281
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:20,631
Go run! And sing aloud!

282
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:26,511
Today, everyone's clad
in light at every corner

283
00:24:03,031 --> 00:24:08,151
In the dream land
enlightenment has come

284
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:13,271
Spreading happiness to nooks
and corners of all hearts

285
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:19,270
Such joy has never
bloomed till today

286
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:24,231
The heart lives again,
all disease is washed away

287
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:18,551
Those that reside on
the tree of wishes

288
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:23,391
They too are slowly,
coming close.

289
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:29,270
It is you, love breathes around

290
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:34,231
The night and day merge
like these two lives

291
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,791
That piece of crap!
Dada...

292
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:12,151
I will shove it up his...-
- Shut up!

293
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:16,451
Who are you?-
- Let me introduce.

294
00:26:16,476 --> 00:26:18,827
Mr. Shukumar.
The Party's district head.

295
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:21,012
Take his blessings.-
- Oh!

296
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:25,012
Proshanto.
Very active chap.

297
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:28,667
He's so busy in the area,
doesn't have time to visit you.

298
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:31,172
Anyway, Panchayat
Election is coming up.

299
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:35,052
Improve public relations.
Reach out to people.

300
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,292
I am superb at
reaching out to people.

301
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:41,772
He has even reached the
bedrooms of the villagers. Got it?

302
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,652
Great! He is a useful lad!

303
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:47,612
Weren't you speaking about
some piece of crap?

304
00:26:48,092 --> 00:26:51,085
Here it is, come.
Give him some snacks.

305
00:26:51,116 --> 00:26:55,812
Snacks from Kanai's shop. Gods
come down to have it too.

306
00:26:55,892 --> 00:26:57,692
Please take.

307
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:05,468
Make it with potatoes or
tomatoes. I love snacks.

308
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:08,382
Go inside honey.-
- Go in!

309
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:11,852
Beautiful! Electricity has
come into the village!

310
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:13,892
Yes, all because of him.

311
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:17,052
He went to Kolkata and
nailed it under DBC party!

312
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:21,252
When did I do it?-
- Crow never eats crow meat.

313
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:24,091
Never hide anything
from your own clan.

314
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:26,972
I've not popped out of
nowhere today. Okay?

315
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:29,507
I have all the
news. Correct news.

316
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:32,172
Switch off all the lights
before Panchayat Election.

317
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:36,194
Our bikes will arrive and
take care of the problem.

318
00:27:37,048 --> 00:27:39,968
And what were you saying?-
- Tell him.

319
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:44,702
There's a bast... err
rascal in our village.

320
00:27:44,727 --> 00:27:48,012
Barun Biswas? Works at the
Mitra Institution in Kolkata.

321
00:27:48,092 --> 00:27:52,365
Teaches there. Good, we've
always wanted to educate people.

322
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,552
That's our motto, right?

323
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:57,132
I know that. So?-
- What you don't know is...

324
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,492
Barun comes back home in
the 8:30pm train everyday.

325
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:02,092
So?

326
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:08,289
Crowded train. If someone
pushes him from behind...

327
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:11,738
and he falls, what will
people call it? Murder?

328
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:13,201
Or accident?

329
00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:22,331
Good morning Sir.

330
00:28:22,356 --> 00:28:24,304
Very good morning, sit.

331
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:29,091
I asked you to read
about Tagore's life...

332
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:34,600
before I started
teaching 'Mrityunjoy'.

333
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,256
How many of you did that?

334
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:40,092
Knew it.

335
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,067
I trust you guys.

336
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,190
Why sir?

337
00:28:45,711 --> 00:28:48,507
Because you guys
are honest. Sit.

338
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:50,732
Look...

339
00:28:51,388 --> 00:28:55,148
anyone can answer the regular
questions after reading the story.

340
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:59,593
It is there in the book itself. But
where did the story take birth?

341
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:02,732
Under which situations
and experiences...-

342
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:05,343
Oh, good morning sir.

343
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:07,944
Morning! Sit down
my son!

344
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,990
Derozio! How are you?-
- Good sir.

345
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:15,562
There is a meeting in the
evening. Syllabus is changing.

346
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,067
We need to see how important
this change is for the kids.

347
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,958
Please be there.-
- Sure.

348
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:24,452
Oh yes, what news there? Have
the scoundrels been arrested?

349
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,513
Not yet. But I am
not giving up.

350
00:29:27,962 --> 00:29:31,482
I can see that in the fire in
your eyes. You know Barun...

351
00:29:31,932 --> 00:29:35,761
my roots too are in the village.
When you brought light there...

352
00:29:35,786 --> 00:29:40,106
I felt so happy! Felt like
my roots got stronger.

353
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,372
Sometimes I wonder,
what if even I could do it.

354
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:46,092
Sure sir, why
wouldn't you be able to?

355
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:49,092
Can everyone be Barun Biswas?

356
00:29:49,757 --> 00:29:52,202
Get back to the battle with
your Bengal Regiment.

357
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:53,406
I'll go to my class.-
- Yes sir.

358
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,637
See you in the meeting.-
- Sure.

359
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:59,068
Yes, where was I?

360
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:01,348
Rabindranath Tagore.

361
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:03,593
Rabindranath and his
life's philosophy.

362
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:17,948
Please move a bit.-
- How much more?

363
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:31,170
- Hey, Barun...
- Yes...

364
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:33,148
Come sit on my seat.

365
00:30:34,326 --> 00:30:35,988
Come sit on my seat.

366
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,628
I'm fine here. Please sit.

367
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:43,348
Told you Barun da will
be late, go home.

368
00:30:43,948 --> 00:30:47,028
Come on.-
- Yes, I'll tell you when he comes.

369
00:30:47,468 --> 00:30:51,348
My daughter is very ill. Master
said he'll give money today.

370
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:54,348
Please let me meet him once.

371
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:58,268
I've to buy quite a few books.
Master da asked me to come today.

372
00:30:58,388 --> 00:31:01,628
Please let me see him.-
- My house fell day before.

373
00:31:01,788 --> 00:31:05,188
Dada said he'll give money.
Please let me meet him.

374
00:31:05,268 --> 00:31:08,628
Who Dada? I am his big brother.
I'll tell Barun when he comes.

375
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:13,228
Make it fast. He'll come with the
salary, it'll be over in no time.

376
00:31:13,308 --> 00:31:15,468
Please go.-
- Yes, when Barun...

377
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:20,948
You guys are here? Sorry,
got a bit late.

378
00:31:21,108 --> 00:31:25,388
Ajit uncle, go to Kolkata and
get her check up done. Okay?

379
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,868
Okay.-
- Ashish...

380
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:31,828
Here, for your books. And you
buy bats and balls with this...

381
00:31:31,948 --> 00:31:35,468
I'll make you do ten rounds of
the field at dawn. Remember.

382
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:37,988
What is all this! Please!

383
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,268
Gouri.

384
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,348
Go rebuild your
house. Alright?

385
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:44,828
What is wrong with you guys!

386
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:48,788
Your school fee was pending
right? Here. Oh God!

387
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:51,628
This is incorrigible!

388
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:55,268
You must reopen
your shop. Okay?

389
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:58,508
Keep this.
Uncle.

390
00:31:59,188 --> 00:32:03,188
Your theatre group
should not close. Okay?

391
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:09,028
You, buy the medicines and
give it your wife on time.

392
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:10,948
And please
don't fall at my feet!

393
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:14,228
Okay? Everyone happy?

394
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:20,748
May god bless you!-
- May God bless everyone.

395
00:32:21,428 --> 00:32:22,428
Go home.

396
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,983
For the monthly grocery?

397
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:41,363
Dada, I think you've to go beg
at station from the next month.

398
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:45,188
Or else forget monthly, there
won't be money for the weekly.

399
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:47,095
Don't try to be over smart now.

400
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,708
No. No one else
can. Only you will.

401
00:32:50,508 --> 00:32:54,470
Telling you again, these people
will forget you one day.

402
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:58,391
I'm telling you again too, no
worries when my brother is here!

403
00:32:58,416 --> 00:33:01,268
Please take my bag.-
- Why will you be worried?

404
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:04,148
Everyone else will
worry, about you.

405
00:33:04,403 --> 00:33:07,923
I'm worried for you. Why
here till so late? Go home!

406
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,338
Won't. I'll stay here
tonight. At your place.

407
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:16,877
No food for dinner.
You know our situation.

408
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:20,112
Won't eat.
But I'll stay here.

409
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,034
Think you've grown
up now huh? Go home!

410
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,850
Hey wait.
Don't go alone.

411
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,530
Come I'll drop you.
Come on!

412
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,490
Be safe.-
- You stay safe too.

413
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,770
Hold her tight!-
- Let me go!

414
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,810
Hey!

415
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,690
What's happening huh?

416
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,610
Please come out.

417
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,450
What happened?-
- I was going home.

418
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,794
These boys pulled me here.

419
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,650
Where do you stay?

420
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,438
In this village, Subodh
Mullick's daughter.

421
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,692
Come with me, I'll drop you.

422
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,966
Baba!

423
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,530
What's wrong dear?-
- They're coming again!

424
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,705
Who?-
- They!

425
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,010
Where?

426
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:04,306
Can you hear it? Your
Master da's bike's sound.

427
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,770
Now feel safe? Sleep.

428
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,610
Come on, sleep.

429
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,730
Sleep.

430
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,370
Hey! What's happening
here? Get lost!

431
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:48,295
Fine! We'll find you later!

432
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:54,010
Don't be scared. Don't
worry. I'm there!

433
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,010
I'll roam the village roads
every night now onwards.

434
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,803
Be with your family. I'll get
the doctor. Okay? Go in.

435
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,010
Where's Barun da?-
- In his room.

436
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,370
In his room?-
- Sleeping.

437
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,490
Still sleeping?

438
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:22,111
Worked as a security
guard last night.

439
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:25,222
Guarding the village. I
can't take all this anymore!

440
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:27,322
See what you can do.

441
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,650
Didn't sleep?-
- Tried to but...

442
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,195
then thought of writing
this letter, so writing it.

443
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,700
What letter?

444
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,410
I'm writing a letter to the
newspapers, against these crimes.

445
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,582
We have to find a solution.

446
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:52,047
But you'll fall ill if you
stay up all night like this.

447
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,480
Doesn't matter.

448
00:36:56,846 --> 00:37:01,046
We'll stay up with you
too. I'll bring you food.

449
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:02,966
I'm I going for a picnic?

450
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:05,726
You said we all must
stick together.

451
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:10,126
Cut this crap. Go in and see
if there is anything to eat.

452
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:12,526
I'm hungry,
didn't eat last night.

453
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,766
I'll finish the letter by then.

454
00:37:24,046 --> 00:37:25,046
Here.

455
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:29,766
If you want anything
else, I'll make it.

456
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:31,046
Not needed.

457
00:37:41,232 --> 00:37:42,312
Have you eaten?

458
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,602
Eaten?-
- Yes.

459
00:37:48,486 --> 00:37:52,046
Haven't I asked you
not to lie for no reason?

460
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:55,627
Open your mouth.

461
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:58,686
Make it bigger.

462
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:14,966
I have something for you.

463
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:20,697
Take this. Read it.

464
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:30,649
Listen, finish the rest,
I'll leave.

465
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,095
Very hard.

466
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:37,214
The book.

467
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:46,829
It is not the book that's hard.

468
00:38:47,631 --> 00:38:49,631
It is hard to understand you.

469
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:14,566
The nature is with me, it's time
to make my wishes come true

470
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:21,486
My eyes are cloud cast,
a subtle sweet pain lingers away

471
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,566
Oh, the keeper of my heart,

472
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:30,486
My heart has given me the hint

473
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:36,966
Tell me why the sky is
so colourful today?

474
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:35,993
Wherever I set foot,
I leave no shadows behind

475
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:47,167
I shy away from stepping
ahead, my lips are sealed.

476
00:40:47,854 --> 00:40:52,439
Oh river

477
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,807
what if he comes
and stands before me...

478
00:41:55,752 --> 00:42:03,752
I bosom my heart,
but for how long?

479
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:13,047
The bird of my heart,
flies away for no reason

480
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:17,047
Oh, the bird of my heart

481
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:22,047
what do I name him?

482
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:07,247
Turned into Matangini
Hajra being with Barun.

483
00:43:07,887 --> 00:43:11,647
Processions and parades
in the local roads. Nice.

484
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:15,687
I'll shove
all your revolution up!

485
00:43:16,687 --> 00:43:19,047
Today we start the ribbon
cutting ceremony.

486
00:43:19,127 --> 00:43:21,047
We begin with you.

487
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:26,047
With that lovely waist line,
should you be threatening me?

488
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:32,129
A threats prescription:
A riverside injection!

489
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:33,967
Come on.

490
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:50,007
Oh no!

491
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:51,647
Durga!

492
00:43:57,807 --> 00:44:01,284
Doctor! Who's there?

493
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:04,058
What's the fuss?-
- Need to admit a patient.

494
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,483
Which room?-
- Admit? What happened?

495
00:44:06,763 --> 00:44:07,483
Oh God!

496
00:44:07,508 --> 00:44:10,866
Don't worry, tell us the
room, we'll take her.

497
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:13,763
Many rooms are there. But
we need the Panchayat's letter.

498
00:44:14,723 --> 00:44:17,323
What letter?-
- Admission letter.

499
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:21,255
Need a letter and money.-
- The girl's lying in front of you.

500
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:24,043
You're talking about
money? Are you human?

501
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,243
No, an animal!-
- Is that so?

502
00:44:26,323 --> 00:44:28,483
Then we must treat you like one.

503
00:44:28,686 --> 00:44:31,443
Bhai, leave him!
Don't lose your cool!

504
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:33,710
What's all this!
This is a hospital!

505
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:35,322
We know it, he doesn't!

506
00:44:35,323 --> 00:44:37,326
The girl's dying. He's
waiting for a letter!

507
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:38,831
Let me see.

508
00:44:40,323 --> 00:44:43,003
No letters needed. Bring
her. I'll see you later.

509
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:45,043
Nikhil come!

510
00:44:57,123 --> 00:44:59,763
You son of a gun!-
- I'm not here to fight!

511
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:05,323
Could've got the entire village
to destroy everything here!

512
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:08,942
But I've come alone. And
only to tell you that...

513
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:11,659
that's enough.
No more!!

514
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:16,459
Time and again given you
chances to correct yourself.

515
00:45:16,484 --> 00:45:18,739
Asked you to surrender.
Nothing happened.

516
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:23,407
Told the village, the police and
now telling you standing here,

517
00:45:23,727 --> 00:45:27,927
I'll put all of you into the jail
within the next forty-eight hours!

518
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:30,207
Stop me if you can.

519
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:52,327
Platform of Awakening.

520
00:45:57,807 --> 00:45:59,407
Platform of Awakening.

521
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:10,687
Give it to me.

522
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,767
How much?
Not now please.

523
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,327
Please take this.

524
00:46:32,888 --> 00:46:34,208
Just have a look.

525
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,407
My name is Barun Biswas.

526
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:39,470
A member of the
Platform of Awakening.

527
00:46:41,287 --> 00:46:43,212
Please read this.
Please!

528
00:46:43,311 --> 00:46:46,711
Don't need to look,
just keep your ears open.

529
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:49,407
And listen carefully.

530
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,327
All of you know that
in the past few days...

531
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:56,967
thirty women have been
raped in our village.

532
00:46:57,087 --> 00:47:02,156
Those monsters have exhausted
our efforts to report or complain.

533
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:04,887
Their oppression has only
increased. But how long?

534
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:07,807
How long shall we endure? We
know the police won't do anything.

535
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:10,302
Those ministers are
sitting on their head.

536
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:13,102
It is those ministers who
are petting these dogs.

537
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:17,367
But if those dogs come
out and bite humans...

538
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:22,302
then their owner must pay,
and the dogs must be punished.

539
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:24,814
Whether the dogs
be insane or not!

540
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,408
They can hit us once, twice.

541
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:34,167
Thrice. May be we'll fall.
But the fourth time...

542
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:39,900
we'll learn. We'll
stand up and revolt!

543
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:41,847
We shall stand up!

544
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,582
On behalf of the Platform of
Awakening committee I demand..

545
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:49,222
The arrest of Ronojit Koley,
Haran Sardar, Shekhar Mallik

546
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,887
Makhan Gayen right now,

547
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:53,407
including their leader,
Proshanto Mondol!

548
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:55,367
Hey! Will you shut up!

549
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:57,382
I'll cut you into
millions of pieces!

550
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:01,727
Even your family won't...-
- Only us or I won't do!

551
00:48:01,807 --> 00:48:04,327
You all will have to
raise you voices with us.

552
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:07,041
Or else there is no end
to this darkness!

553
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:13,647
Open your ears and listen,

554
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:18,884
maybe you all will buy your
daily groceries and go home

555
00:48:19,102 --> 00:48:22,806
then eat and sleep. But
when you open your eyes...

556
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:25,822
you may see these same monsters

557
00:48:26,247 --> 00:48:29,641
attacking your homes,
your women, like beasts!

558
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:33,986
Don't know about you all,
but in my village, in my home

559
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:35,866
I won't tolerate dirty dogs.

560
00:48:35,986 --> 00:48:40,026
I Barun Biswas, demand their
arrest again from this platform.

561
00:48:40,186 --> 00:48:44,466
These dogs, these beasts
should be arrested right away!

562
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,386
Now is the time

563
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:57,106
So I sing you this wake-up call

564
00:48:58,346 --> 00:49:01,226
The horizon

565
00:49:01,946 --> 00:49:07,866
calls out to you for the
search of a new direction

566
00:49:29,746 --> 00:49:36,306
Your tears dried up at the
corner of your eye, mother

567
00:49:36,586 --> 00:49:42,786
But no more! It's time to
wipe away those tears

568
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:17,786
A rebellious wind
unsettles the numb waters

569
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:22,146
and caresses her with affection

570
00:50:23,866 --> 00:50:26,346
A new wave has risen

571
00:50:28,186 --> 00:50:31,506
at a sleepy harbor

572
00:50:31,746 --> 00:50:34,666
on this wintry,
morning of slumber

573
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:38,986
a footstep is heard,

574
00:50:41,026 --> 00:50:43,386
Someone has arrived

575
00:50:48,706 --> 00:50:51,706
Here, keep this book.
Golden words of Ramkrishna.

576
00:50:52,346 --> 00:50:56,180
Read it in the jail.
Will help. Hold it.

577
00:50:58,986 --> 00:51:00,306
Take him sir.

578
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,038
Come on, get them.

579
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:14,363
Sir, so late at night?-
- Get out! Out!

580
00:51:14,388 --> 00:51:16,904
Okay sir.-
- Bhai!

581
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:21,311
Bhai? Now you've
found time to come?

582
00:51:21,336 --> 00:51:24,073
I was busy running
around for you, got it?

583
00:51:24,153 --> 00:51:26,673
And what have you got now?

584
00:51:26,698 --> 00:51:29,858
Orders from above. Or they
couldn't have picked you up.

585
00:51:30,313 --> 00:51:33,113
And the main fellow behind
all this is that new in charge.

586
00:51:33,138 --> 00:51:35,420
Jayanta Chakraborty.-
- That son of a...

587
00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:40,312
Don't worry. I've taken care
of Jayanta Chakraborty.

588
00:51:40,313 --> 00:51:41,513
They'll pick him up.

589
00:51:41,913 --> 00:51:43,633
Give me my thing.-
- Thing? Oh.

590
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:52,673
He got me into the lock-up!

591
00:51:54,513 --> 00:51:56,990
He is too brave isn't he?

592
00:51:57,633 --> 00:52:01,673
I'll shove up all that bravery,
my name is Proshanto Mondol!

593
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:05,313
Only seen me hiss,
not seen the poison!

594
00:52:05,593 --> 00:52:08,633
Comes back home in the
local train at 8:30pm.

595
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:10,673
Won't anymore.

596
00:52:15,793 --> 00:52:17,313
Son, are you there?

597
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,408
Son, you there?

598
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:20,433
Here.

599
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:24,473
Tuni got back from
the hospital today.

600
00:52:24,498 --> 00:52:30,312
I can never pay you
back for what you did.

601
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:34,753
Your aunt says, I can never
give you money for your help.

602
00:52:34,873 --> 00:52:36,953
She sent some sweets.

603
00:52:37,313 --> 00:52:38,473
Great!

604
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:41,313
Put it in the bag please.-
- Sure.

605
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:47,393
The entire village is
talking about what you did!

606
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:49,658
It was only my
duty. Now go on.

607
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:50,683
Yes.

608
00:52:52,313 --> 00:52:53,313
Master da.

609
00:52:54,433 --> 00:52:56,917
Sit here.-
- No, you sit.

610
00:52:57,371 --> 00:53:00,993
Pradip, you did not give
me the list of books.

611
00:53:03,928 --> 00:53:06,368
Why do you help them?
You bring them books.

612
00:53:06,408 --> 00:53:08,008
And they loiter cinema halls.

613
00:53:08,273 --> 00:53:11,313
But Ashu uncle, your men
too haven't reached yet.

614
00:53:11,393 --> 00:53:13,273
I've made all preparations.

615
00:53:13,313 --> 00:53:17,968
They'll come. We're indebted
to you for all that you do.

616
00:53:17,993 --> 00:53:20,273
Chuck that. Do one thing...

617
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:24,513
no, actually don't bother. I'll
send Nikhil with everything.

618
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:25,738
Okay?-
- Fine.

619
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,873
What?

620
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:34,313
What happened?-
- You won't change.

621
00:53:34,993 --> 00:53:37,273
There is no need to change.

622
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,793
Go on then.

623
00:53:46,313 --> 00:53:49,313
Was there anything in
the newspapers today?

624
00:53:49,353 --> 00:53:51,313
Don't know about Kolkata but...

625
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:54,313
there was a small story in
today's local newspaper.

626
00:53:54,793 --> 00:53:58,313
I don't think I can do it.-
- Same here.

627
00:53:58,353 --> 00:54:00,313
But the money?

628
00:54:00,393 --> 00:54:04,313
Don't be scared. They're
coming. Get ready.

629
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:07,312
Get the evening newspaper
from Robi da's shop.

630
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:08,473
Okay.

631
00:54:09,353 --> 00:54:11,393
Should I come along.-
- Sure.

632
00:54:11,473 --> 00:54:12,953
I'll be back.-
- Go.

633
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:17,313
I'll go get the bike
out from the stand.

634
00:54:19,473 --> 00:54:21,313
Listen...-
- Yes.

635
00:54:21,513 --> 00:54:24,913
I owe Robi da some
money. Clear the due.

636
00:54:25,273 --> 00:54:26,873
Heard me?-
- Yes.

637
00:54:26,913 --> 00:54:29,313
Master da.-
- Yes.

638
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:32,054
Yes, tell me.

639
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:42,353
What the...-
- Run!

640
00:54:43,353 --> 00:54:44,433
Master!

641
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:48,109
Kingshuk!

642
00:54:48,134 --> 00:54:50,654
Master! What happened!

643
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,579
Please help someone!
Please!

644
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,540
I'm your Barun.

645
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,140
Please get me to a...

646
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:00,900
hospital...

647
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:08,869
No more worries!

648
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,940
Now is the time

649
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:16,820
So I sing you this wake-up call

650
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,660
The horizon

651
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,860
calls out to you for the
search of a new direction

652
00:55:47,963 --> 00:55:49,210
Master!

653
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,835
FEW DAYS LATER...

654
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:24,761
Looking for someone?

655
00:56:29,164 --> 00:56:30,444
Need a van?

656
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:34,965
Where to?-
- Dukhiya.

657
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:37,125
Barun Biswas's place.

658
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:38,725
You?

659
00:56:39,205 --> 00:56:41,805
Barun and I used to teach
in the same school.

660
00:56:42,605 --> 00:56:43,845
Namaskar!-
- Namaskar!

661
00:56:43,965 --> 00:56:44,965
Come.

662
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:49,125
Why did Barun have to die?

663
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:04,285
Honey.

664
00:57:05,085 --> 00:57:07,739
Surekha.

665
00:57:13,081 --> 00:57:14,637
Come out dear.

666
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:16,965
Come.

667
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,685
My daughter, Surekha.

668
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:28,765
Weren't you asking
why Master had to die?

669
00:57:29,323 --> 00:57:32,723
This too is a reason.
Can you see?

670
00:57:32,805 --> 00:57:35,517
What they did
with my little girl!

671
00:57:35,698 --> 00:57:38,281
They don't leave mothers too.

672
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:50,964
Meeting for Barun da's death.
Then to the police station.

673
00:57:50,965 --> 00:57:54,220
Kingshuk will take you.
You will come too.

674
00:57:54,245 --> 00:57:55,245
And...

675
00:57:58,113 --> 00:58:01,713
Master's friend from the school,
he's come from Kolkata.

676
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:10,485
Durga?

677
00:58:11,965 --> 00:58:12,965
Yes.

678
00:58:14,965 --> 00:58:16,525
Come if you can.

679
00:58:24,965 --> 00:58:26,964
Who did we lose?

680
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:28,005
Barun da?

681
00:58:28,765 --> 00:58:32,565
The same man who's an idol to
our village's young generation?

682
00:58:32,605 --> 00:58:36,845
Never supported violence, nor
took up a gun or became a leader.

683
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:39,685
He loved the pen over the gun.

684
00:58:40,085 --> 00:58:41,965
He'd say, "Durga...

685
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,845
there is nothing
mightier than the pen."

686
00:58:45,685 --> 00:58:49,605
And those who killed this man
aren't punished even today!

687
00:58:49,805 --> 00:58:53,685
When he died I thought, we could no
more do anything about those beasts.

688
00:58:53,925 --> 00:58:55,725
And what could we do?

689
00:58:56,885 --> 00:58:59,125
Then I remembered
something he had told me.

690
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:04,822
He would often tell me, "Not
the time to shed tears, Durga."

691
00:59:04,885 --> 00:59:07,565
"This is the time to
make fire out of the tears.

692
00:59:07,897 --> 00:59:11,257
There is much more you women,
can do, that we men can't."

693
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:15,363
Barun da taught us
Swami Vivekananda's teachings.

694
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,160
Get up. Wake up.
Realise what you deserve.

695
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:26,078
Only if we stand up shall
the criminals be punished.

696
00:59:26,805 --> 00:59:29,964
We won't back out from getting
beaten up or from revolting.

697
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:32,965
Are you with us?-
- Yes! We are all there!

698
00:59:34,965 --> 00:59:38,445
We will all be there!

699
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:50,847
Punish the killers of
Barun Biswas right away!

700
00:59:50,927 --> 00:59:52,407
Right now! Right now!

701
00:59:57,407 --> 00:59:58,407
Ray!

702
00:59:59,203 --> 01:00:00,203
Hey Ray!

703
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:02,407
See what's happening!

704
01:00:03,118 --> 01:00:04,638
The police will have to punish!

705
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:05,918
Stop them!

706
01:00:07,998 --> 01:00:10,038
The police will have to punish!

707
01:00:14,718 --> 01:00:16,118
Yes, okay, fine!

708
01:00:18,158 --> 01:00:20,853
Handle this.
I'll be back.

709
01:00:20,878 --> 01:00:22,197
Please calm down!

710
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:24,958
Barun Biswas, we
won't forget you!

711
01:00:39,772 --> 01:00:42,951
This is the press where we
stayed up to print the leaflets.

712
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:47,045
The memories are still fresh,
I still feel weird!

713
01:00:47,498 --> 01:00:51,018
Barun would sit here. He
wouldn't let anyone speak.

714
01:00:51,043 --> 01:00:52,858
He would go on speaking.

715
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:58,437
Ajit uncle's daughter isn't improving,
we've to take her to Kolkata.

716
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:03,278
That would need two thousand,
have to buy Pradip's books too.

717
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:05,878
Another thousand for that.
Durga, do one thing...

718
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:10,238
tell everyone I'll get my salary in
4 days. Then I'll take care of it.

719
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:14,838
This village had become
a pit of anarchy!

720
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,918
Barun started prowling
the village roads at night.

721
01:01:18,038 --> 01:01:20,437
Took up the responsibility
for all the houses.

722
01:01:20,438 --> 01:01:23,438
People would feel safe with
the sound of his bike and sleep.

723
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:27,438
They knew, whatever happened
Barun Biswas, was there.

724
01:01:28,278 --> 01:01:32,238
But Barun's murderers are
sleeping in peace right now.

725
01:01:34,918 --> 01:01:37,438
The public has a
very bad memory sir.

726
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:40,438
Today they're talking
about Barun Biswas.

727
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:46,018
A film-star comes tomorrow,
Barun Biswas will find no place.

728
01:01:47,158 --> 01:01:48,798
Whatever is the
flavor of the season.

729
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:23,678
Barun!

730
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:29,838
How are you?

731
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,958
Good sir. And you?

732
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,398
Not good.

733
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:39,638
Do you think

734
01:02:40,398 --> 01:02:44,158
the people you worked so
hard for, they'll pay back?

735
01:02:46,758 --> 01:02:49,158
A nation is known
by its citizens.

736
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:51,878
A civilization by it's humanity.

737
01:02:52,158 --> 01:02:56,438
And a society by it's?-
- People. Not by the hypocrites.

738
01:02:57,318 --> 01:02:58,678
Exactly.

739
01:02:59,198 --> 01:03:00,198
Barun...

740
01:03:01,678 --> 01:03:03,158
I want to be like you!

741
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:05,958
Like you!

742
01:03:07,438 --> 01:03:08,438
Bye sir.

743
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:47,190
They're free again.
Right sir?

744
01:03:48,878 --> 01:03:52,718
Sir, won't they ever
be punished?

745
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:58,278
What they did to me and other
village women, to Barun da...

746
01:03:58,398 --> 01:04:01,478
all those criminals will
never be punished?

747
01:04:03,878 --> 01:04:05,678
Tears are for the coward.

748
01:04:06,198 --> 01:04:08,638
Not for brave
women like you, Durga.

749
01:04:09,198 --> 01:04:11,558
Your Barun did not
teach you to cry.

750
01:04:13,078 --> 01:04:16,718
He has taught you to
fight. So, don't be scared.

751
01:04:17,238 --> 01:04:21,158
Do not shed tears.
Always remember...

752
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:25,518
Where the mind is without fear
and the head is held high

753
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:31,293
Where knowledge is
free, where the world

754
01:04:31,318 --> 01:04:34,158
has not been broken
up into fragments

755
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:46,925
Please listen!
Barun...

756
01:04:48,478 --> 01:04:50,358
Barun Biswas.

757
01:04:51,238 --> 01:04:55,998
He, who stood here one day
asking you to revolt. To unite!

758
01:04:56,078 --> 01:05:00,798
Do you remember that
Barun Biswas is no more today?

759
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:05,481
But those, who's
oppressions he revolted against,

760
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,961
those, who killed him, they
have not been punished!

761
01:05:09,336 --> 01:05:14,570
They're celebrating their
freedom with colours and music!

762
01:05:15,318 --> 01:05:21,638
Barun, who remained
worried for you all his life...

763
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:23,798
Who's that?

764
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:28,901
Don't you want his
killers to be punished?

765
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:30,406
Hey move aside!

766
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:34,478
He wanted our well-
being, won't you revolt?

767
01:05:34,613 --> 01:05:39,173
Come, let's go to the police.
Let's build another revolt!

768
01:05:39,293 --> 01:05:43,853
Oppression in every village
loss of dignity of the women

769
01:05:43,971 --> 01:05:46,771
won't all this get justice?

770
01:05:46,973 --> 01:05:50,653
Those criminals are now...

771
01:05:50,678 --> 01:05:51,838
You bloody moron...

772
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:04,777
Barun's dad is dead.
Who on earth are you?

773
01:06:04,802 --> 01:06:07,758
His illegitimate father are you?

774
01:06:54,106 --> 01:06:55,145
Take my hand.

775
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:56,466
Get up!

776
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,261
Here.

777
01:07:15,341 --> 01:07:18,061
Take a breather.
Only the first round.

778
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:26,501
No point looking. You don't
know this infamous face.

779
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:32,860
The poet said, 'He will FIT it all'.
I use an 'H' instead.

780
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:36,341
He will Hit it all. Let's go.-
- Where?

781
01:07:36,703 --> 01:07:37,781
To hit...

782
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:40,021
it at the right place?

783
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:44,421
I believe in two things, a
hard punch and a hard kick.

784
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:46,021
Come.

785
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:59,741
What nonsense! He peed on
your face, that's the complaint?

786
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:04,019
You're kidding here?-
- No, I'm just surprised!

787
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:07,566
This is such a silly thing!

788
01:08:07,591 --> 01:08:10,581
And the market area isn't ours.

789
01:08:12,461 --> 01:08:14,261
Explain to him.

790
01:08:14,514 --> 01:08:16,285
I? Okay.

791
01:08:19,781 --> 01:08:23,581
Told you that market area
isn't under our police station.

792
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:25,381
Want me to hang a board?

793
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,260
Under who is it then?

794
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:28,741
Err... Dulanpur.

795
01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:31,498
Dulanpur said it is
not under them.

796
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:34,661
Laudiha station then.-
- Laudiha?

797
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:42,781
Laudiha? Okay. Let's go.

798
01:08:43,261 --> 01:08:45,741
He pushed me to the
ground and peed on me!

799
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:49,261
And why did you have
to give that lecture?

800
01:08:49,301 --> 01:08:51,901
Besides, market is not our area.

801
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:56,221
Everyone is saying the same
thing. Who is it under then?

802
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:59,221
The market? It is under
Proshanto and Ashim Mondol.

803
01:08:59,661 --> 01:09:03,285
Proshanto Mondol did
this. And it is under him?

804
01:09:03,861 --> 01:09:07,861
Now that you're shouting his
name, do you know who he is?

805
01:09:09,035 --> 01:09:10,261
Who is he?

806
01:09:13,466 --> 01:09:17,386
Who is this Proshanto Mondol?
Manmohan Singh or Vivekananda?

807
01:09:17,796 --> 01:09:22,556
Hey you! Acting smart?
Will thrash you to dirt!

808
01:09:22,901 --> 01:09:24,501
You son of a gun!

809
01:09:34,261 --> 01:09:35,261
Listen!

810
01:09:36,846 --> 01:09:38,806
Animesh Dutta.
Special Branch.

811
01:09:39,361 --> 01:09:39,881
Sir!

812
01:09:39,994 --> 01:09:42,434
They keep tossing the ball!

813
01:09:43,674 --> 01:09:46,889
Blood!-
- Wrap up the furnitures.

814
01:09:46,914 --> 01:09:49,434
Set it under the tree between
all three police stations.

815
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:52,769
That'll be the police station
and this, a beauty parlour.

816
01:09:52,794 --> 01:09:54,434
Facials and all that!

817
01:09:57,834 --> 01:10:01,433
I'm in charge of the village
and the 3 officers under me.

818
01:10:01,434 --> 01:10:05,674
And print this in your mind,
if you act over smart...

819
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:08,394
will grind you to dirt!

820
01:10:12,314 --> 01:10:14,434
Don't give me that look Grandpa!

821
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:17,434
Treat them any better and
they'll sit on your head.

822
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:22,908
Come along Grandpa,
they won't feed you snacks.

823
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:29,554
Yes, tell me the
problems. Come.

824
01:10:30,889 --> 01:10:33,649
They want to make a
Party office in my land.

825
01:10:33,674 --> 01:10:36,064
Threatening me if I refuse!

826
01:10:36,089 --> 01:10:39,829
Even insulting my family!-
- Is this a problem?

827
01:10:39,854 --> 01:10:43,654
If it happens again, give one
tight slap and then tell me.

828
01:10:44,734 --> 01:10:49,774
Hello Mr.Bachhan!
Where you off to so early?

829
01:10:49,894 --> 01:10:51,134
To Kolkata.

830
01:10:51,934 --> 01:10:55,294
She is going to the lawyer
and I'm going to the media.

831
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:57,393
Wait and watch, I'll
shaken the media again!

832
01:10:57,418 --> 01:10:59,793
They'll be arrested
and punished again!

833
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:04,993
I'll introduce.-
- Yes!

834
01:11:05,018 --> 01:11:06,953
She's Durga.
And he is...

835
01:11:13,513 --> 01:11:17,393
Animesh Dutta. Special Branch.-
- Special Branch?

836
01:11:17,513 --> 01:11:19,833
Yes.-
- Answer one question of mine.

837
01:11:19,913 --> 01:11:21,033
Sure!

838
01:11:21,513 --> 01:11:25,553
Proshanto, Haran, Ronojit, Makhon,
will they ever be punished?

839
01:11:26,513 --> 01:11:27,833
Please come with me.

840
01:11:28,393 --> 01:11:30,033
You too, please.

841
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:32,353
Come.

842
01:11:34,033 --> 01:11:36,495
Please stand here and I'll sit.

843
01:11:37,353 --> 01:11:38,593
Concentrate.

844
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:41,725
This is West Bengal, this is me.

845
01:11:42,593 --> 01:11:45,633
This is Proshanto going to
Delhi as Member of Assembly.

846
01:11:46,353 --> 01:11:50,393
This is my wife cooking at home,
this is me getting a transfer.

847
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:54,593
And this is my wife, not at
my home, at Andaman now.

848
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:57,953
So I have been
transferred to Andaman.

849
01:11:58,593 --> 01:12:00,513
A jumbled up situation!

850
01:12:01,073 --> 01:12:02,553
Let's go.

851
01:12:06,558 --> 01:12:10,914
The demon slayer, Durga!
Why didn't I come here earlier?

852
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:20,033
What were you saying?-
- About Barun Biswas...-

853
01:12:20,393 --> 01:12:24,593
The Minister's daughter is getting
married today. Loads of guests!

854
01:12:25,313 --> 01:12:29,033
We're media partners. I
promise this will happen later.

855
01:12:35,094 --> 01:12:38,248
Check it and send it.
You're still here?

856
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,608
Barun Biswas...-
- Told you...

857
01:12:40,633 --> 01:12:42,686
Barun Biswas won't
sell well right now.

858
01:12:42,711 --> 01:12:45,171
Sell?-
- I did it when it sold.

859
01:12:45,196 --> 01:12:47,553
Another emotional...-
- This isn't emotional?

860
01:12:47,593 --> 01:12:51,148
Yes, but very old. Give me
new news. I promise to do it.

861
01:12:51,173 --> 01:12:54,053
Samar, I'm doing
the minister's story.

862
01:12:54,539 --> 01:12:58,782
No Sir, not possible right
now. And who knows him?

863
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:01,893
Those who did,
have forgotten him.

864
01:13:01,933 --> 01:13:07,204
Not possible. But if you arrange
something, I could arrange too.

865
01:13:07,532 --> 01:13:11,733
Arrange?-
- Nothing comes free, you see.

866
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:14,932
Give me something, I'll
see what I can give you.

867
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:18,093
It is all give and take today.

868
01:13:18,532 --> 01:13:23,093
I get it but how will the
common man relate to him?

869
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:27,093
But Barun was one of them,
he spoke for them.

870
01:13:27,173 --> 01:13:29,893
Doesn't matter
what he spoke off.

871
01:13:29,933 --> 01:13:33,933
Did any political leader or a
celebrity speak about his death?

872
01:13:34,013 --> 01:13:35,213
Then...

873
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:36,973
a social activist?-
- No.

874
01:13:37,573 --> 01:13:40,293
In that case, what
can we do sir?

875
01:13:40,613 --> 01:13:43,914
You could go to the
village and ask around...

876
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:48,533
Yes, we can do that, do one
thing, get hold of a leader..

877
01:13:48,613 --> 01:13:53,853
Or a celebrity to support your
issue, then we can do it.

878
01:13:53,893 --> 01:13:57,133
Otherwise the news will not
be salable you know? Sorry.

879
01:13:57,253 --> 01:13:58,253
Excuse me.

880
01:14:00,573 --> 01:14:01,773
Salable?

881
01:14:05,653 --> 01:14:08,961
What are you looking for
oldie? Want a Sunny Leone?

882
01:14:12,853 --> 01:14:14,933
Barun Biswas?-
- Barun Biswas?

883
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:16,853
Who's that?

884
01:14:27,973 --> 01:14:28,973
Hello!

885
01:14:30,653 --> 01:14:32,329
Hello!-
- Yes?

886
01:14:34,173 --> 01:14:37,013
Who is this man?-
- Sorry?

887
01:14:37,288 --> 01:14:38,368
Who is he?

888
01:14:38,773 --> 01:14:41,586
That's Che.-
- I understand, Che.

889
01:14:41,933 --> 01:14:44,932
But who is Che?-
- Actually, a style icon.

890
01:14:44,933 --> 01:14:48,938
He'd write and ride on a bike.
Biker-writer you know?

891
01:14:52,627 --> 01:14:53,867
Barun Biswas?

892
01:14:54,768 --> 01:14:56,768
Sorry?-
- Barun Biswas!

893
01:14:58,173 --> 01:15:01,573
Actually Barun Gandhi,
yes. Seema Biswas, yes.

894
01:15:01,693 --> 01:15:04,813
Barun Biswas? No.
Sorry old man.

895
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,005
Who is Barun Biswas?

896
01:15:16,776 --> 01:15:17,816
Please sit.

897
01:15:22,735 --> 01:15:25,774
Err..
How about some whisky?

898
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,930
Anything apart from
cow-dung and tiger's fat.

899
01:15:30,695 --> 01:15:34,055
Could've told us you wanted
to meet, we'd go see you.

900
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:36,264
Got it?-
- Nice!

901
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:39,215
Obviously, it is your duty to
welcome someone like me.

902
01:15:44,015 --> 01:15:48,095
Take the bottle! You're a
massive drunkard it seems!

903
01:15:48,175 --> 01:15:51,215
You swine... why did
you kill Barun Biswas?

904
01:15:52,295 --> 01:15:56,215
Sorry. His face is so
similar to that of a pig you see.

905
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:59,775
Why did you kill Barun Biswas?

906
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:01,844
I?-
- How will he know?

907
01:16:01,869 --> 01:16:05,055
How will he know?
He's my sweet little bro!

908
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,950
Nothing could be
proved. So he got a bail.

909
01:16:07,975 --> 01:16:11,446
We're throwing a party to
celebrate the bail, got it?

910
01:16:11,695 --> 01:16:13,735
Why did the boys
change the statement?

911
01:16:13,855 --> 01:16:16,255
Why did the boys
change the statement?

912
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:19,135
Why?-
- I don't know. They might've.

913
01:16:19,215 --> 01:16:22,215
You're the bloody sweet brother.
My father should know!

914
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:25,089
I'm abusing again.
I'm sorry.

915
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:31,008
Eat.-
- Oh no!

916
01:16:34,655 --> 01:16:36,534
There!-
- Not the muffler!

917
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:39,279
I'll clean it. Let me see.

918
01:16:43,695 --> 01:16:45,590
Where else did it...-
- My foot.

919
01:16:45,756 --> 01:16:47,916
Foot? Where?

920
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:51,479
Where?

921
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:53,759
Sorry!

922
01:17:05,315 --> 01:17:06,315
Need to pee!

923
01:17:07,075 --> 01:17:09,155
Show him.-
- I know how to pee.

924
01:17:09,515 --> 01:17:10,515
But where?

925
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:15,475
Come straight and do
it on the wall. Okay?

926
01:17:16,395 --> 01:17:20,395
Oh no!-
- Wait I'll pick it up.

927
01:17:20,475 --> 01:17:23,515
Where did it go?
One rupee. Yes.

928
01:17:25,275 --> 01:17:27,435
It's raining. Make it fast!

929
01:17:28,995 --> 01:17:31,035
What are you doing!

930
01:17:31,115 --> 01:17:35,555
Brick for a brick.
Stone for a stone.

931
01:17:38,315 --> 01:17:40,355
Got it you swine?

932
01:17:44,515 --> 01:17:47,195
Holy cow! Did I pee
on your face?

933
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:51,915
Oh no! Actually your
face is so idiotic...

934
01:17:51,955 --> 01:17:54,475
abusing again, sorry.

935
01:17:54,515 --> 01:17:57,435
The coins.-
- Keep them.

936
01:17:58,075 --> 01:18:02,515
Buy a soap with that, never
know when you stain your face.

937
01:18:44,355 --> 01:18:45,475
Barun!

938
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:48,955
No one remembers you.

939
01:18:50,515 --> 01:18:52,514
Who did you fight for?

940
01:18:52,515 --> 01:18:55,515
A Barun Biswas doesn't
do anything for anyone.

941
01:18:56,235 --> 01:19:00,195
When a shining sword peeps out
from a dump of rusted iron..

942
01:19:00,355 --> 01:19:02,515
It needs to be held
high with respect.

943
01:19:03,115 --> 01:19:05,875
And that self-respect
is called Barun Biswas.

944
01:19:06,235 --> 01:19:08,515
Explain this to everyone sir.

945
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:11,515
People deserve government.

946
01:19:12,395 --> 01:19:16,475
The law and order of a nation
depends on how its people are.

947
01:19:17,395 --> 01:19:19,515
So, people themselves
need to change.

948
01:19:19,715 --> 01:19:22,195
Exactly! People will
have to change.

949
01:19:23,715 --> 01:19:28,035
That's a very hard job sir.
All are crumpled in fear.

950
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,515
They'll gab Shakespeare
sitting at home,

951
01:19:31,715 --> 01:19:34,475
'Cowards die many times
before their death.'

952
01:19:34,515 --> 01:19:40,435
They'll teach their kids, 'to do or
take injustice, both are both hateful.'

953
01:19:40,795 --> 01:19:44,195
Promote honesty but go grab
someones promotion at work.

954
01:19:44,355 --> 01:19:48,835
This is the nature.
It is in the veins.

955
01:19:51,115 --> 01:19:52,795
You can't do it sir.

956
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:55,155
Doesn't Barun Biswas's
fate explain it?

957
01:19:55,915 --> 01:19:59,875
And what if one finds a shining
age old piece of steel in

958
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:03,035
that rusted dump of irons?

959
01:20:05,302 --> 01:20:08,450
Best of luck sir.
Goodnight.

960
01:20:15,382 --> 01:20:17,422
Goodnight Mr.Bachhan.

961
01:20:32,142 --> 01:20:34,902
What? Just a sauce stain.

962
01:20:34,942 --> 01:20:37,902
Was having some
snacks with alcohol. It fell.

963
01:20:38,942 --> 01:20:45,973
All the respect you just gave me
vanished when you smelt alcohol?

964
01:20:46,902 --> 01:20:48,102
Anyway.

965
01:20:48,942 --> 01:20:52,481
Pretty late. Go
sleep Mr.Bachhan.

966
01:20:54,902 --> 01:20:59,582
But remember what I said,
people deserve government.

967
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:04,422
And what were you saying?

968
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:10,075
An old piece of steel
in the rusted dump?

969
01:21:12,342 --> 01:21:13,342
See you.

970
01:21:41,222 --> 01:21:44,982
Dada, it was Haran's head.-
- Good it is gone.

971
01:21:45,582 --> 01:21:47,302
There was only cow-dung in it.

972
01:21:47,982 --> 01:21:50,382
Madhu, Anup, Shamal...-
- Yes Dada!

973
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:53,622
How did it happen?-
- Just one hit.

974
01:21:54,222 --> 01:21:57,342
What's the case?-
- Is the case in our hands anymore?

975
01:21:57,502 --> 01:21:59,262
It is in his hands now.

976
01:22:01,742 --> 01:22:04,262
Then go call him!-
- Are we crazy?

977
01:22:04,662 --> 01:22:08,542
That day's thrashing! This is
an open area, God knows...-

978
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:12,278
Listen to Dada! Arguing
huh? Go call him.

979
01:22:13,382 --> 01:22:15,622
Go!-
- Listen to Proshanto!

980
01:22:16,543 --> 01:22:20,263
We've a lot of work
to do Dada. Let's go.

981
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:28,702
Then let's go ourselves.

982
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:37,582
Last night's alcohol is
coming out even now.

983
01:22:37,622 --> 01:22:40,662
Five son's of Haradhon,
four remain, know that?

984
01:22:40,782 --> 01:22:41,982
As in?

985
01:22:44,091 --> 01:22:46,731
Found it in the
body's pocket. And...

986
01:22:48,102 --> 01:22:50,062
a far more interesting thing!

987
01:22:51,742 --> 01:22:52,742
See.

988
01:22:54,255 --> 01:22:58,015
The wires have been cut off
as impeccably as the head.

989
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:01,490
Could've killed Barun in
the same way. Sorry.

990
01:23:01,785 --> 01:23:03,865
Didn't mean it. -
- What nonsense!

991
01:23:04,758 --> 01:23:08,358
We didn't kill Barun. The Platform
of Awakening people have done it.

992
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:11,856
They're putting the blame
on us. We didn't do anything.

993
01:23:11,881 --> 01:23:16,729
Trying to put us down.-
- Is yours down?

994
01:23:18,678 --> 01:23:20,478
You always speak below the belt.

995
01:23:20,637 --> 01:23:23,197
Not only speak, I work
below the belt too.

996
01:23:23,237 --> 01:23:28,152
Anyway. Be safe, those who's
names came up in Barun's murder

997
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:33,294
he's one of them. Others are
Ronojit, Shekhar, Makhan, Haran.

998
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:36,039
Haran's gone. Don't
know who took him.

999
01:23:36,537 --> 01:23:37,537
Hence,

1000
01:23:38,161 --> 01:23:41,161
Haradhan's five sons,
remain only four.

1001
01:23:42,062 --> 01:23:43,942
Terrible tension!

1002
01:23:44,142 --> 01:23:45,662
Loads of tension!

1003
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:48,468
Give way please.

1004
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:51,654
Oh no!

1005
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:56,917
Even biscuits are
difficult these days!

1006
01:23:57,182 --> 01:24:00,102
Mr. Arun, where were you
the day Haran was killed?

1007
01:24:00,518 --> 01:24:04,243
Why will I say? The enquiry
began four days after Barun died.

1008
01:24:04,268 --> 01:24:06,540
Right after a goon
dies you're at it?

1009
01:24:06,565 --> 01:24:10,262
Quiet! Don't call
him a goon!

1010
01:24:10,822 --> 01:24:15,942
Know how many phone calls came
for a social worker like Haran?

1011
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:19,216
He dies!-
- Social worker?

1012
01:24:19,294 --> 01:24:21,654
Sure, it was the
society he served.

1013
01:24:22,497 --> 01:24:26,205
Perspectives. People say
Lord Krishna is God.

1014
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:28,790
Some say he is characterless.

1015
01:24:31,489 --> 01:24:34,886
You don't give importance to the
investigation of this murder.

1016
01:24:34,911 --> 01:24:39,109
But it's my duty. So I ask again,
where were you last night?

1017
01:24:39,134 --> 01:24:43,294
At home. I teach, so
was home after that.

1018
01:24:44,694 --> 01:24:47,534
And that gets you
by in this village?

1019
01:24:47,814 --> 01:24:50,534
I've a small electricity
business.

1020
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:54,574
What business? Are
you saying the truth?

1021
01:24:54,654 --> 01:24:57,734
Are you suspecting Arun?

1022
01:24:58,654 --> 01:25:04,534
That's the problem. I'm
suspecting you too Mr.Bachhan.

1023
01:25:06,054 --> 01:25:09,254
Mr. Nikhil, Mr. Kingshuk,
the demon slayer Goddess,

1024
01:25:09,407 --> 01:25:10,854
suspecting all of you.

1025
01:25:10,974 --> 01:25:14,214
Weird similarity between special
branch officers and girlfriends.

1026
01:25:15,214 --> 01:25:17,254
Both are extremely suspicious!

1027
01:25:18,254 --> 01:25:21,446
Would've suspected
my dead dad too...

1028
01:25:21,471 --> 01:25:26,534
a teacher in Kolkata, why
come to this forgotten village?

1029
01:25:30,014 --> 01:25:33,534
No one owns this village,
I don't need permission.

1030
01:25:33,774 --> 01:25:34,814
True.

1031
01:25:34,894 --> 01:25:38,934
You have them in front of
you, can't get hold of them?

1032
01:25:45,494 --> 01:25:49,214
I have a lot of people
in front of me.

1033
01:25:50,534 --> 01:25:53,214
But can one catch
hold of everyone?

1034
01:25:53,534 --> 01:25:57,534
I'm getting late for school.
Let me tell you one thing

1035
01:25:58,134 --> 01:26:02,654
Arun can't do this. His
philosophy for people, for life,

1036
01:26:02,727 --> 01:26:05,174
One minute!
Another lecture?

1037
01:26:06,344 --> 01:26:08,974
No time now. See you
in Puja holidays.

1038
01:26:10,854 --> 01:26:11,974
Be safe, you guys.

1039
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:16,454
Can't size this man up. Keep
your thoughts to yourself.

1040
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:19,533
There's no need to
depend on others. Okay?

1041
01:26:19,534 --> 01:26:20,574
Bye.

1042
01:26:26,454 --> 01:26:28,854
Grandpa, one question,
if you don't mind.

1043
01:26:29,534 --> 01:26:31,734
Does it matter if I do?-
- Not really.

1044
01:26:32,534 --> 01:26:34,494
Let me ask then.

1045
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:43,534
What is your father's name?-
- Why?

1046
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:45,094
Not 'Y'. An 'H'.

1047
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,414
'H' for Haradhon.

1048
01:26:48,614 --> 01:26:52,534
Haradhon's five sons,
remain only four. Here.

1049
01:26:53,134 --> 01:26:55,134
Found it at the crime spot.

1050
01:26:56,414 --> 01:26:58,534
Who could it be?

1051
01:26:59,494 --> 01:27:00,494
Arun?

1052
01:27:01,014 --> 01:27:03,534
Barun? Or all of them?

1053
01:27:04,854 --> 01:27:07,534
Namaskar.-
- Please come. Namaskar.

1054
01:27:07,614 --> 01:27:11,894
Please sit. Tea or coffee?-
- Don't bother.

1055
01:27:11,974 --> 01:27:16,854
Tea? Is this a tea shop? So
many almirahs, take out a bottle.

1056
01:27:16,894 --> 01:27:19,574
Will finish it in no time!-
- Proshanto!

1057
01:27:19,774 --> 01:27:24,869
Let's talk work. We have
a Party Meet day after.

1058
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,389
Yes.-
- So, I decided

1059
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:29,894
to set it up here in the school.

1060
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,989
But there are some tests to be
conducted in school day after.

1061
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:37,454
So what? Postpone it to the
next day. Any problem?

1062
01:27:37,682 --> 01:27:39,202
Yes, there's a problem.

1063
01:27:42,795 --> 01:27:45,084
School closed for a
political party's meet?

1064
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:46,749
Not acceptable.

1065
01:27:46,774 --> 01:27:51,311
Mr. Binod, why get into this?-
- Have to if needed!

1066
01:27:51,534 --> 01:27:55,772
Some political hooligans will come
and close the school, we'll accept it?

1067
01:27:55,797 --> 01:28:00,734
You know who he is? The
chairman of the school committee.

1068
01:28:02,225 --> 01:28:04,709
Educational qualification?
First standard?

1069
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:07,065
You! I will...

1070
01:28:09,428 --> 01:28:13,454
Will kill you! Peeing on
the face wasn't enough?

1071
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:14,877
Brother!

1072
01:28:24,522 --> 01:28:25,762
New teacher?

1073
01:28:26,494 --> 01:28:27,494
My foot!

1074
01:28:27,814 --> 01:28:28,814
The Meet

1075
01:28:29,839 --> 01:28:31,225
happens here.

1076
01:28:31,942 --> 01:28:34,862
And in this school!
Got it?

1077
01:28:35,774 --> 01:28:36,854
Bye.

1078
01:28:37,602 --> 01:28:39,029
Come Proshanto.

1079
01:28:45,436 --> 01:28:49,028
You'll do good.
You'll make it big in life!

1080
01:28:49,053 --> 01:28:49,764
I'm leaving.

1081
01:28:49,789 --> 01:28:52,545
Please sit. Tell me
what you were saying.

1082
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:55,100
What's the point? Your eyes
are red, will you remember?

1083
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:58,773
Don't worry. Just say, now
that you've thought of it.

1084
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:02,406
Once you say it you'll feel like
you've peed after a long wait.

1085
01:29:02,553 --> 01:29:04,833
I mean you'll feel lighter.

1086
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:10,873
They're doing a Meet in our school.
So school's closed tomorrow.

1087
01:29:10,993 --> 01:29:14,033
Snatching away the
birth right to education!

1088
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:16,990
We're becoming slaves!-
- Sir Ashutosh!

1089
01:29:17,174 --> 01:29:19,134
Bengali Tiger!

1090
01:29:19,673 --> 01:29:20,913
Go home!

1091
01:29:21,165 --> 01:29:22,245
I swear...

1092
01:29:22,728 --> 01:29:23,968
I swear on my drink...

1093
01:29:23,993 --> 01:29:27,233
the moment you start
with your lecture ballads,

1094
01:29:27,332 --> 01:29:29,863
all my senses stop working!-
- Protector of law...

1095
01:29:29,888 --> 01:29:35,833
I'm none of that. Get into a
brawl trying to stop the Meet!

1096
01:29:36,633 --> 01:29:39,753
Stupid enough to get
into it intentionally...

1097
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:43,713
Fine! Sit and drink!
I'll go stop them!

1098
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:46,233
How? Do you
have a cap?

1099
01:29:46,513 --> 01:29:50,833
Respected Chairman, oops!
That's me!

1100
01:29:50,913 --> 01:29:54,480
I have with me our
dear Minister and our...

1101
01:29:54,833 --> 01:29:58,193
representative who has
come all the way from...

1102
01:29:59,172 --> 01:30:00,172
Hello!

1103
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:03,441
Come on children, get in.

1104
01:30:05,473 --> 01:30:07,593
Come, go to your classes.

1105
01:30:08,313 --> 01:30:09,353
Come boys!

1106
01:30:10,645 --> 01:30:12,965
Push them out!
Get lost you guys!

1107
01:30:18,925 --> 01:30:24,472
Too smart are you now?
Get out! Get lost!

1108
01:30:30,201 --> 01:30:31,201
Dada!

1109
01:30:31,725 --> 01:30:33,371
Hello! Yes.

1110
01:30:33,605 --> 01:30:37,725
The main topic in today's
Meet is the Committee election.

1111
01:30:38,005 --> 01:30:42,125
Our golden future!
Those little kids...

1112
01:30:42,165 --> 01:30:43,325
they...

1113
01:30:43,925 --> 01:30:45,325
There they come!

1114
01:30:48,005 --> 01:30:49,845
Light to you, light to us!

1115
01:30:49,925 --> 01:30:51,101
Light the Lantern!
Light the Lantern!

1116
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:52,845
Light to you, light to us!

1117
01:30:54,725 --> 01:30:56,165
Come on. Run. Move!

1118
01:31:01,383 --> 01:31:02,423
Dada.

1119
01:31:04,005 --> 01:31:05,005
Go!

1120
01:31:05,613 --> 01:31:08,780
Come on get out.
Get going now!

1121
01:31:08,805 --> 01:31:10,285
Circus going on!

1122
01:31:11,613 --> 01:31:14,085
Throwing our boys out?

1123
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:17,137
What?

1124
01:31:17,246 --> 01:31:21,246
Why don't you teach your Dada
anything? Police will do that too?

1125
01:31:22,298 --> 01:31:25,738
Beat you publicly,
that's a gimmick.

1126
01:31:25,885 --> 01:31:26,965
Idiot.

1127
01:31:28,005 --> 01:31:29,205
Fix it.

1128
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:42,439
You hit my brother?
- No, saved him.

1129
01:31:43,559 --> 01:31:46,931
Don't do the Meet here Dada.-
- Why?

1130
01:31:46,956 --> 01:31:52,079
I'm the chairman here, I can
do Meets or whatever I wish!

1131
01:31:53,479 --> 01:31:57,853
Yes you can. But Panchayat
Elections ahead. What about it?

1132
01:31:57,878 --> 01:32:01,439
Why?-
- You've closed down the school!

1133
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:03,736
That's become a huge
issue in the village.

1134
01:32:03,761 --> 01:32:06,876
Do you keep any news?
Your stupid brother is useless.

1135
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:09,676
Yes but...-
- Rather, get me alcohol

1136
01:32:09,806 --> 01:32:13,519
I'll get you the news.-
- Sure. But what about today?

1137
01:32:13,599 --> 01:32:17,275
Stop the Meet at once.-
- Fine. But...

1138
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:20,900
Listen, Meets keep happening.
Vote only comes once.

1139
01:32:20,925 --> 01:32:23,251
Definitely! Remove it.
No, give me!

1140
01:32:23,276 --> 01:32:26,017
Meet is over for today.
Please go home all of you.

1141
01:32:26,064 --> 01:32:29,478
Dada, why's it stopping?-
- Fixed the hair?

1142
01:32:30,264 --> 01:32:33,744
Alright now?-
- You look like such an idiot!

1143
01:32:33,769 --> 01:32:36,824
I thought I was mistaken.
But now I am sure.

1144
01:32:36,864 --> 01:32:39,224
Explained to your
Dada. Ask him..

1145
01:32:39,264 --> 01:32:41,751
You're alone
enough to destroy him!

1146
01:32:41,776 --> 01:32:45,264
Come Proshanto. Thank you.-
- Always at your service.

1147
01:32:48,224 --> 01:32:50,224
Hello everyone!

1148
01:32:50,744 --> 01:32:53,384
Hooliganism is over for today.

1149
01:32:54,824 --> 01:32:56,104
Here you are!

1150
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:57,344
Grandpa...

1151
01:32:58,344 --> 01:33:01,264
Go take your class now.-
- Thank you.

1152
01:33:01,304 --> 01:33:07,264
Wait. Why physics-chemistry? Teach
them to stand up for themselves.

1153
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:10,984
Rabindranath wrote 'Where
the mind is without tear'

1154
01:33:11,264 --> 01:33:13,984
Fear.-
- I'm talking about the girl, Tiya.

1155
01:33:14,704 --> 01:33:16,384
See you.-
- Where to?

1156
01:33:16,784 --> 01:33:20,664
To iron my clothes. Party
at night. They've invited.

1157
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,824
Bad cop in the morning.
Good cop at night.

1158
01:33:24,264 --> 01:33:27,986
The dancer's from Kolkata.
I'll get some nice dinner!

1159
01:33:42,264 --> 01:33:44,064
Fantastic!

1160
01:33:44,784 --> 01:33:48,624
Laying out all that she has

1161
01:33:48,704 --> 01:33:52,144
Rai sits here

1162
01:34:01,623 --> 01:34:04,623
Where is Vrindavan?

1163
01:34:05,388 --> 01:34:08,228
Where is Kanha?

1164
01:34:29,188 --> 01:34:31,188
Where are you, the dark one?

1165
01:34:34,895 --> 01:34:39,335
Come reveal yourself. Rai is
sinking in the river of your love.

1166
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:15,995
My body has become
a river of your love.

1167
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:20,090
See, I await you with my
tresses spread out.

1168
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:28,650
I was born blind,
bound in shackles

1169
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:32,450
Kanha shall bring me
my sweet devastation

1170
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:37,930
Have been nurturing
my body all the year

1171
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:41,930
Like the flower's pollen grains,
like the wheat golden yield.

1172
01:36:48,450 --> 01:36:52,689
I'll lose myself in you,
come with me tonight

1173
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:56,370
Only I can fathom
the waves your tide

1174
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:30,090
Damn! Where are you?
Reveal yourself.

1175
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:34,970
Rai is sinking in the
river of your love

1176
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:45,450
What an engine!
What a body!

1177
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:48,570
Chumki!-
- She's a rocket!

1178
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:50,610
Who was that?

1179
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:53,770
Chumki is in the car.

1180
01:37:56,690 --> 01:37:59,890
Want to come?-
- Where to? The graveyard?

1181
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:03,770
To heaven! We'll go
galloping in our farm house!

1182
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:10,490
Capable?-
- What did he mean?

1183
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:16,709
I'll go home!-
- Brother.

1184
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:22,030
Government's car's going to
the farm house! With Chumki!

1185
01:38:22,576 --> 01:38:26,350
Dada, sit in front.
I'll ride.

1186
01:38:29,655 --> 01:38:33,270
Walking was better.-
- You guys get this car.

1187
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:49,710
Oh my God!

1188
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,430
So powerful!

1189
01:39:04,176 --> 01:39:06,817
TWO MORE LEFT

1190
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:22,430
You go.-
- You go.

1191
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,270
You go! No, you go.

1192
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:26,870
Let's count?

1193
01:39:29,017 --> 01:39:30,630
Let's go together.-
- Yes.

1194
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:35,870
Sir, it blew up as soon as
the ignition was switched on.

1195
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:39,870
Sent to the Forensic?-
- Yes, report will come in 5 days.

1196
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:43,310
Found this circuit too sir.-
- Where was it?

1197
01:39:43,390 --> 01:39:44,710
Under the clutch-screw sir.

1198
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:49,790
The circuit was attached
to the hydraulic.

1199
01:39:49,870 --> 01:39:51,190
The ignition was...

1200
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:52,990
No.

1201
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:56,790
Circuit gets switched on if ignition
is switched on with the clutch.

1202
01:39:56,830 --> 01:39:59,390
Other end was in the gear box?-
- Yes sir.

1203
01:40:01,087 --> 01:40:03,430
Are these circuits sold here?-
- No sir.

1204
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:07,270
No such electric shop in
this area that could sell it.

1205
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:10,470
First ever car blown
up in our area, sir.

1206
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:13,190
Though, a reason could be...

1207
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:17,830
What reason?-
- What reason?

1208
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:22,390
Mr. Binod has restarted
the Platform of Awakening.

1209
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:24,750
Arun, Durga..
They are there too.

1210
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:29,390
The way outsiders are coming
in, if only one of them's a Maoist...

1211
01:40:29,525 --> 01:40:31,806
then it is done sir!

1212
01:40:50,057 --> 01:40:52,448
Hey you! What the hell...

1213
01:40:52,648 --> 01:40:53,928
Who is it?

1214
01:40:56,208 --> 01:40:57,328
Dada!

1215
01:40:58,288 --> 01:40:59,848
Oh, it's you!

1216
01:41:01,602 --> 01:41:03,842
Great! The half ticket
is there too!

1217
01:41:04,488 --> 01:41:07,128
Why are you on the road?-
- Getting a tan.

1218
01:41:07,299 --> 01:41:10,019
Come home, have lunch
and sit in the sun.

1219
01:41:10,128 --> 01:41:14,408
Road is okay with me. Never
know what happens in your home.

1220
01:41:14,488 --> 01:41:16,248
You speak a lot of nonsense!

1221
01:41:16,288 --> 01:41:18,540
Let's do some nonsense
too? What's in the car?

1222
01:41:18,565 --> 01:41:20,447
Why do you care?-
- Want to see.

1223
01:41:20,472 --> 01:41:24,512
Got veggies from the market
to feed the poor today.

1224
01:41:24,712 --> 01:41:27,352
Wait, feed me first then.

1225
01:41:30,472 --> 01:41:33,912
Where are you going?
Told you we've got veggies.

1226
01:41:34,008 --> 01:41:35,872
What nonsense!

1227
01:41:36,472 --> 01:41:39,359
Running like fools!

1228
01:41:40,352 --> 01:41:42,072
What's your problem?

1229
01:41:43,432 --> 01:41:46,752
Loads of veggies eh?

1230
01:41:47,512 --> 01:41:48,872
Now you're crossing the limit.

1231
01:41:48,952 --> 01:41:50,512
Always done that.

1232
01:41:50,752 --> 01:41:51,792
Radish!

1233
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:52,992
Oh!

1234
01:41:58,432 --> 01:41:59,352
A luffa?

1235
01:41:59,353 --> 01:42:00,992
An elephant foot?

1236
01:42:01,712 --> 01:42:04,592
Here it is!

1237
01:42:05,512 --> 01:42:10,847
Lady's finger? And what's
this? An entire banana tree!

1238
01:42:10,872 --> 01:42:14,172
For how much?-
- Here, speak to Mr. Saswata.

1239
01:42:14,312 --> 01:42:17,712
Who Saswata? Actor?-
- No, Saswata Mitra.

1240
01:42:18,003 --> 01:42:20,523
From the Writer's building.-
- Oh my God!

1241
01:42:20,792 --> 01:42:23,032
Yes, tell me Sir.

1242
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:27,499
Let them go?
But why?

1243
01:42:28,432 --> 01:42:29,552
Oh!

1244
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:34,420
So you'll smuggle in arms into
the village before the vote,

1245
01:42:34,445 --> 01:42:38,485
and I have to let them go?
But I don't get it, why?

1246
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:42,880
Yes I know all of that.
I know you very well.

1247
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:47,352
A few years of ministry
and then to the jail.

1248
01:42:47,704 --> 01:42:50,304
Listen, do not give me
that bull crap!

1249
01:42:50,515 --> 01:42:56,711
People have permanently ended up
in the eye hospital because of me.

1250
01:42:57,272 --> 01:42:58,472
Swine.-
- Who?

1251
01:42:58,687 --> 01:43:01,647
Take your phone. Listen.

1252
01:43:01,672 --> 01:43:04,825
I'm taking in your
car and the stuff.

1253
01:43:04,937 --> 01:43:08,327
But I'm letting you and your
brother go. Know why?

1254
01:43:08,352 --> 01:43:11,258
Someone's already
taken up the work of

1255
01:43:11,283 --> 01:43:15,187
finishing you both for free. Then
why waste government's money...

1256
01:43:15,212 --> 01:43:19,232
and put you in the jail.-
- I won't tolerate this...

1257
01:43:20,352 --> 01:43:22,952
I give a damn!

1258
01:43:25,829 --> 01:43:29,229
Don't you bathe him?
Paid him to buy soap,

1259
01:43:29,254 --> 01:43:30,989
he boozed up with it.

1260
01:43:38,132 --> 01:43:40,412
Make it fast! Hurry!

1261
01:43:40,492 --> 01:43:45,023
Night jasmine at
midnight! Brilliant!

1262
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:53,311
Hello sweetheart!

1263
01:43:54,029 --> 01:43:55,029
Hello!

1264
01:43:55,789 --> 01:43:57,269
What's up?

1265
01:44:15,029 --> 01:44:16,789
Hello!

1266
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:34,589
Hello?-
- Still dumping?

1267
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:37,629
Ronojit died.-
- Ronojit died?

1268
01:44:37,654 --> 01:44:40,109
Yes, a while ago.-
- Who are you?

1269
01:44:40,497 --> 01:44:41,629
Barun.

1270
01:44:43,229 --> 01:44:45,149
Barun?-
- Yes, Barun.

1271
01:44:45,669 --> 01:44:50,789
Believe it or not, Haradhan's
five sons, remains only one.

1272
01:44:50,989 --> 01:44:52,709
Proshanto.

1273
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:56,788
Sit, knot in the pajamas?

1274
01:44:56,789 --> 01:44:57,709
No!-
- Then?

1275
01:44:57,789 --> 01:44:59,069
Barun.-
- Barun?

1276
01:44:59,149 --> 01:45:01,709
Yes, he called.-
- What!

1277
01:45:01,789 --> 01:45:02,789
Yes.

1278
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:05,909
You had a stomach upset,
now I think you've gone mad!

1279
01:45:05,989 --> 01:45:08,789
No its true, I'm scared!-
- Dada...

1280
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:10,789
Madhu? Come sit.

1281
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:14,949
That's alright.

1282
01:45:15,029 --> 01:45:17,669
These two constables
for your security.

1283
01:45:17,789 --> 01:45:19,909
They'll stick with
you all the time.

1284
01:45:20,069 --> 01:45:22,442
Very good. Keep this.

1285
01:45:22,869 --> 01:45:26,136
Here; for sweets.-
No need sir. It's for free.

1286
01:45:26,161 --> 01:45:29,833
Why free?-
- What if Barun sees me?

1287
01:45:29,858 --> 01:45:33,927
Told you so.-
- Why's everyone harping on this?

1288
01:45:33,935 --> 01:45:37,935
Gone mad?-
- Not me, the villagers are saying.

1289
01:45:38,505 --> 01:45:41,935
Barun is back. He's prowling
the village all night.

1290
01:45:41,975 --> 01:45:46,473
Many have heard his bike.
How can I take money now?

1291
01:45:46,645 --> 01:45:47,935
See you Dada.

1292
01:45:51,095 --> 01:45:52,295
Oh.

1293
01:45:52,935 --> 01:45:57,775
Let me tell you something.
After seeing Mr. Animesh...

1294
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:00,997
I feel like doing something in
life without a personal motive.

1295
01:46:01,095 --> 01:46:02,335
Good luck.

1296
01:46:03,067 --> 01:46:05,107
Let's go.
You guys stay here.

1297
01:46:47,895 --> 01:46:51,935
What's up? Who took
your ladder away?

1298
01:46:52,185 --> 01:46:53,345
No one.

1299
01:47:00,255 --> 01:47:03,655
Birds are very intuitive
to nature you know?

1300
01:47:03,805 --> 01:47:07,870
For example; that crow
found out something.

1301
01:47:07,895 --> 01:47:11,215
What?-
- A wire, just like this one.

1302
01:47:11,660 --> 01:47:14,719
It was tied tightly between
these two trees.

1303
01:47:15,232 --> 01:47:19,110
Mr. Haran drove into it in
high speed and splash!

1304
01:47:27,197 --> 01:47:33,727
Tied together like the
strings of a Veena...

1305
01:47:37,391 --> 01:47:39,775
I got the clue from the song.

1306
01:47:39,935 --> 01:47:40,935
Oh.

1307
01:47:41,715 --> 01:47:45,675
So you're looking for the
murderer of the criminals.

1308
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:50,030
But you've no plans to
look for Barun's killers.

1309
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:52,590
No sir. Ruler's don't
get punished.

1310
01:47:52,615 --> 01:47:55,735
Punishment is for subjects.-
- That's what you think.

1311
01:47:55,815 --> 01:47:58,575
Someone doesn't think
so. So he's punishing.

1312
01:47:58,735 --> 01:48:00,735
He'll punish Proshanto too.-
- No.

1313
01:48:00,815 --> 01:48:02,735
Won't let him.-
- Why?

1314
01:48:03,615 --> 01:48:07,149
People like Barun,
don't save for themselves,

1315
01:48:07,402 --> 01:48:09,002
nor let others.

1316
01:48:09,977 --> 01:48:13,427
But Proshanto... is a
rascal of the first order.

1317
01:48:13,452 --> 01:48:15,875
In better words, a bastard!

1318
01:48:16,055 --> 01:48:19,655
Sorry. He will get me the
transfer and promotion.

1319
01:48:19,775 --> 01:48:22,899
I need him.
He can't die!

1320
01:48:23,655 --> 01:48:24,655
Oh.

1321
01:48:25,215 --> 01:48:27,476
But Barun can die, right?

1322
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:30,261
A scarcity of good
things is better.

1323
01:48:30,391 --> 01:48:33,661
Or else a crowd of good
things make it mediocre.

1324
01:48:35,329 --> 01:48:38,032
Those lines don't suit you.-
- Oh.

1325
01:48:38,142 --> 01:48:39,982
But they suit you, is it?

1326
01:48:40,462 --> 01:48:44,222
Trust us with the lines
too. What scares you?

1327
01:48:44,862 --> 01:48:46,422
Tagore after all.

1328
01:48:47,222 --> 01:48:49,422
Will keep him with care.

1329
01:48:52,222 --> 01:48:55,102
Will that take care
of everything?

1330
01:48:56,813 --> 01:48:57,942
No sir.

1331
01:48:58,022 --> 01:49:00,702
These wires aren't sold here.

1332
01:49:00,782 --> 01:49:04,456
Not sold here?-
- No, this is a copper wire.

1333
01:49:04,481 --> 01:49:07,401
What is it used for?-
- Electrical work sir.

1334
01:49:08,222 --> 01:49:10,782
How many gauzes is this?

1335
01:49:11,022 --> 01:49:12,022
I guess...

1336
01:49:12,942 --> 01:49:14,142
point five.

1337
01:49:14,942 --> 01:49:18,222
You can find this at the
Chandni market sir.

1338
01:49:18,882 --> 01:49:21,562
Chandni market, in Kolkata?-
- Yes sir.

1339
01:49:23,342 --> 01:49:25,222
This is a

1340
01:49:26,782 --> 01:49:28,422
a copper wire.

1341
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,221
If this copper wire
is electrified then...

1342
01:49:33,222 --> 01:49:36,302
any magnetic object will
become a magnet.

1343
01:49:36,382 --> 01:49:40,532
For example; see how
this magnetic object...

1344
01:49:40,583 --> 01:49:43,008
turns into a magnet.

1345
01:49:49,142 --> 01:49:50,602
Going home?

1346
01:49:51,862 --> 01:49:52,942
Come sit.

1347
01:49:54,222 --> 01:49:55,446
Come on sit.

1348
01:50:01,329 --> 01:50:05,297
Let's see what you've done.
Oh, not here.

1349
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:21,391
How is it going?

1350
01:50:21,416 --> 01:50:23,221
Everything is arranged
like you wanted.

1351
01:50:23,222 --> 01:50:26,736
Full on rehearsals going on!

1352
01:50:26,761 --> 01:50:29,188
They're slaying Hiranyakashipo
too this time!

1353
01:50:29,222 --> 01:50:30,782
You too must come.

1354
01:50:32,182 --> 01:50:33,182
Oh.

1355
01:50:34,182 --> 01:50:37,702
Can't refuse women...-
- God! Let's go!

1356
01:50:39,262 --> 01:50:40,262
Sure.

1357
01:50:46,142 --> 01:50:49,616
Slaying Hiranyakashipo?
Will it happen?

1358
01:50:49,641 --> 01:50:52,902
God shall himself come to
slash the enemy's chest!

1359
01:50:52,927 --> 01:50:54,702
Angioplasty?-
- Please!

1360
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:05,580
Thank you.

1361
01:51:06,582 --> 01:51:08,822
I had another question.

1362
01:51:09,723 --> 01:51:11,323
Barun Biswas,

1363
01:51:11,706 --> 01:51:14,186
why did he influence
you so much?

1364
01:51:17,111 --> 01:51:20,471
Because I have a concept
called a heart within me.

1365
01:51:22,143 --> 01:51:25,303
Why did you thrash those
goons in the school that day?

1366
01:51:25,919 --> 01:51:28,914
I too have a concept
called, the head.

1367
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,720
It loses it's cool
sometimes, hence.

1368
01:51:33,237 --> 01:51:36,197
But about these
monsters getting killed...

1369
01:51:36,853 --> 01:51:40,453
whoever is doing it, he is
not doing the right thing.

1370
01:51:41,197 --> 01:51:42,877
Just like Kshudiram.

1371
01:51:43,354 --> 01:51:47,114
Some called him a terrorist,
some called him a revolutionary.

1372
01:51:47,774 --> 01:51:49,507
If he gets caught,

1373
01:51:49,532 --> 01:51:53,625
the entire concept of revolt
will distort in his head

1374
01:51:54,907 --> 01:51:56,907
Could you figure out
who's doing it?

1375
01:51:57,462 --> 01:52:00,462
Not completely.
A faint idea.

1376
01:52:01,502 --> 01:52:03,662
A black face in the dark.

1377
01:52:05,262 --> 01:52:08,182
Whoever it is,
can't kill Proshanto.

1378
01:52:08,662 --> 01:52:09,662
Why so?

1379
01:52:09,663 --> 01:52:12,877
Government's given him security.
Future leader of the youth.

1380
01:52:12,902 --> 01:52:17,062
How strict is the security?-
- Don't know. But...

1381
01:52:17,462 --> 01:52:20,542
like you said, God will
himself come to slay him.

1382
01:52:20,662 --> 01:52:23,662
God must be knowing.
He knows everything.

1383
01:52:23,902 --> 01:52:28,917
Hence, Hiranyakashipo demons'
angioplasty is shelved.

1384
01:52:28,942 --> 01:52:31,462
He's taken a pacemaker
you see. Bye.

1385
01:52:32,662 --> 01:52:34,422
Another thing...

1386
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:39,182
You yourself get your requirements
for the physics class from Kolkata?

1387
01:52:39,382 --> 01:52:41,102
Yes, more or less.-
- Okay.

1388
01:52:41,127 --> 01:52:45,382
Get me some copper
wires this time.

1389
01:52:46,222 --> 01:52:49,182
Must be aware where to find it?-
- Yes.

1390
01:52:49,422 --> 01:52:50,622
See you.

1391
01:52:58,582 --> 01:52:59,982
Namaskar.

1392
01:53:00,182 --> 01:53:03,302
Welcome to the cultural event
put up by the joint effort of

1393
01:53:03,862 --> 01:53:07,982
Platform of Awakening and
the people of Dukhiya.

1394
01:53:08,422 --> 01:53:11,502
In today's program we present

1395
01:53:11,662 --> 01:53:14,862
a unique piece of Bengal's
tradition, Chhou dance.

1396
01:53:14,942 --> 01:53:18,803
The Chhou show is about the
slaying of Hiranyakashipo.

1397
01:53:19,302 --> 01:53:23,217
Everything is ready sir.-
- Just the way you wanted it.

1398
01:53:23,302 --> 01:53:25,262
All those who were supposed
to come, have reached.

1399
01:53:26,542 --> 01:53:27,662
Everyone?

1400
01:53:28,102 --> 01:53:29,102
Yes.

1401
01:53:32,102 --> 01:53:35,182
Barun Biswas lit the
fire of revolution!

1402
01:53:35,342 --> 01:53:38,942
And he started walking with
the torch lit from that fire.

1403
01:53:39,662 --> 01:53:42,342
If someone cuts his hand of,

1404
01:53:42,517 --> 01:53:45,997
many more hands must come
up to hold that torch.

1405
01:53:46,037 --> 01:53:47,317
Your hands!

1406
01:53:48,037 --> 01:53:50,397
So you can proudly say...

1407
01:53:50,422 --> 01:53:52,782
Long live revolution!

1408
01:53:53,342 --> 01:53:55,022
Come what may...

1409
01:53:55,942 --> 01:53:58,422
You've to be prepared.

1410
01:53:59,062 --> 01:54:00,902
Can you?-
- Yes sir!

1411
01:54:00,982 --> 01:54:02,342
Right!

1412
01:55:16,292 --> 01:55:21,026
Certificate of achievement,
Binod Bihari Dutta.

1413
01:55:24,902 --> 01:55:26,222
Holy cow!

1414
01:55:37,317 --> 01:55:38,979
Brilliant!

1415
01:55:41,668 --> 01:55:42,828
For you.

1416
01:56:38,863 --> 01:56:40,423
Get up!

1417
01:56:41,379 --> 01:56:42,744
Come with me!

1418
01:56:47,543 --> 01:56:49,783
Enough! Open the mask!

1419
01:56:50,464 --> 01:56:51,543
Open it!

1420
01:57:08,583 --> 01:57:09,983
Look who's here!

1421
01:57:10,303 --> 01:57:12,303
Subhash Chandra Bose!

1422
01:57:13,303 --> 01:57:15,863
The name does
not suit your lips!

1423
01:57:16,103 --> 01:57:17,983
Bloody swine!

1424
01:57:18,155 --> 01:57:20,703
I'll slash your throat!

1425
01:57:20,943 --> 01:57:24,463
Is it? Let's do it then!
Come!

1426
01:58:29,112 --> 01:58:31,552
Let's talk no more.
Come with me.

1427
01:59:03,632 --> 01:59:04,632
Get off.

1428
01:59:08,632 --> 01:59:12,112
What will my country do to you now?-
- What?

1429
01:59:12,232 --> 01:59:16,266
Frame you in many things.
Put you through a lot of crap.

1430
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:22,552
Your revolt was for your values.
You'll not be able to take it, so...

1431
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:26,872
I'll shoot you right here,
won't have to suffer.

1432
01:59:27,072 --> 01:59:32,552
I've done what I had to. No
regrets if you kill me now.

1433
01:59:32,992 --> 01:59:36,398
You see, a revolt is
like a relay race.

1434
01:59:37,192 --> 01:59:40,344
Barun gave me the torch
of revolution. I gave it to...

1435
01:59:40,369 --> 01:59:43,112
Durga, Arun, Kingshuk, Nikhil.

1436
01:59:43,192 --> 01:59:44,872
They'll give it to
someone else one day.

1437
01:59:44,952 --> 01:59:48,551
Rule of society;
kill the revolutionary

1438
01:59:48,552 --> 01:59:50,752
can't kill the fire
of the revolt!

1439
01:59:50,832 --> 01:59:54,152
There was only one Barun.
Now ten Baruns are born.

1440
01:59:54,336 --> 01:59:57,872
Then there'll be hundreds
and thousands. Kill me.

1441
02:00:03,912 --> 02:00:05,112
Won't you kill me?

1442
02:00:06,375 --> 02:00:07,551
Won't you kill me?

1443
02:00:07,552 --> 02:00:11,547
Asking me? Can't place
you, who are you?

1444
02:00:11,752 --> 02:00:14,712
Binod Bihari Dutta.-
- Namaskar. Animesh Dutta.

1445
02:00:16,112 --> 02:00:20,109
Just got the news, my wife's
given birth to a boy.

1446
02:00:20,592 --> 02:00:23,552
Going there.-
- Give him my blessings.

1447
02:00:25,552 --> 02:00:27,112
Thought of a name?

1448
02:00:29,912 --> 02:00:31,392
Barun.

1449
02:00:31,712 --> 02:00:35,000
And the rest
shall follow. Bye.

1450
02:01:27,712 --> 02:01:34,552
Let's grab the sun in our hands!
