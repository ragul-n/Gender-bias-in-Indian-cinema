1
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,285
Hey Malli, where're you going?

2
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,224
Sir, l'm going to Amalapuram
to see my wife.

3
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,362
Why're you unnecessarily going &
coming to Amalapuram?

4
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,266
Why don't you bring her here?

5
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,370
She'll never leave her
parent's house.

6
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,969
l see....

7
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,871
What're there in these sacks?

8
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,606
Cereals & Rice, sir.

9
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:51,810
Go....

10
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,814
Hey, Godraju....

11
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,099
Hey, who're you?

12
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,099
What're you doing?

13
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,006
Take the green pot.

14
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,008
Take it. -Why're you looking
here & there?

15
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,336
Look at him. -Hey, take
the green pot.

16
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,515
Can't you ask your son
to do all this?

17
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,009
Where is he?-Poor fellows!

18
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,679
He is fast asleep. He studied the whole
night in his friend's house.

19
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,019
Your son?

20
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,021
Studied & came.

21
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,357
Last night, l saw him in
the Cinema Theatre.

22
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,860
Since, there was a rush, he
asked me to buy 2 tickets.

23
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,532
l scolded him & sent him
in an auto.

24
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,358
Didn't he come?

25
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,526
He came....

26
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,032
lt was 2 'o' clock in the night.

27
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,704
2 'o' clock?-Yes....

28
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,699
He has come home after buying tickets
in the black & watching the movie.

29
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:49,700
Where is that dog?

30
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,543
l'll ask him to lie down &
l'll roll on him.

31
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,371
Hey, where're you ?

32
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,879
No, say Supreme God!

33
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,386
Come Kadhiresan, come...

34
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,726
Mother, let good things
happen to you.

35
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,888
Okay, why is God sitting
like this?

36
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,226
This is Gundalaniyogam.

37
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,735
The air is the throne.

38
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,904
Your son who took birth
as a human....

39
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,063
He has reached Sagasaram which is
the 6th level in Gundalaniyogam.

40
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,735
When will God go up?

41
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,908
God won't go up, but'll come down.

42
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,571
God! For the past 20 years he's
working as Head Constable.

43
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,247
Can't you consider that?

44
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,419
lt's his fate.

45
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,581
Parents who trouble their
children won't get promotion.

46
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,586
This is told in Dodge ved.

47
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,258
What did we do?

48
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,087
l had asked you for a
sports shoe.

49
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,592
Did you buy that for me?

50
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,093
l've brought & kept.

51
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,100
But, it's not useful.

52
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:48,767
Why?

53
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,932
Why does a person need a shoe
who flies in air?

54
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,272
l'll accept anything you
give me with love.

55
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,770
Give it to me..give it to me...

56
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:56,938
Give it to me, Kadhiresan.

57
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,274
Leave me...leave me...

58
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,772
Don't fall a prey, to my anger?

59
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,447
Shut up.

60
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,945
Switch on the light.

61
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,947
Dear mother! Tell him mother!

62
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,456
You're so clever & intelligent.

63
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,795
Why don't you apply this
in your studies?

64
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,126
Am l not studying?

65
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,299
Very rarely, l went for a
night show -Hold it.

66
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,968
l knew that, you'll fire me.

67
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,532
That's why, l fired you
before you could.

68
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,977
l didn't forbade you from
going to the movies.

69
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,303
l'm asking you, why do you go to
night shows hampering your sleep?

70
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,642
You could've gone to the
evening show, isn't it?

71
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,646
l didn't get tickets for the
evening show.

72
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,152
lt was Jurassic Park.

73
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,149
lt is a Speilberg's movie.

74
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,655
l was very anxious to watch in
on the very first day.

75
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,490
That's why, l went & saw it.

76
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,989
What was the hurry to
watch that movie?

77
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,161
What was the hurry for you?

78
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,831
How many times had l told you?

79
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,564
Whether it is haughtiness or tears,
anger or happiness.

80
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,804
Whatever it may be, hold it
in abeyance for 5 minutes.

81
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,835
ln those 5 minutes,
your mind'll settle down.

82
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,370
Whatever decision taken after
that'll be the right one.

83
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,773
l did postpone it for
5 minutes, daddy.

84
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,308
But within two minutes,
the bell rang, that's why...

85
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,608
l saw the movie.

86
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,831
Only now my bum is very attractive.

87
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,371
Mummy, l'm leaving for college, bye.

88
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:38,226
lf you're thin as a needle
you don't need a pharmacy.

89
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:58,082
To be successful you should
take things easy.

90
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:03,188
Youth is a fantasy in
a rainbow like life.

91
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,074
Please talk to me, Rathi, Rathi.

92
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,707
There are around 3,00,000 words
in Tamil.

93
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,674
Please Rathi, speak atleast
2 words.

94
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:16,534
lf power fails at 'Oliyum Oliyum'
programme take it easy.

95
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:21,430
lf you fail inspite
of studying well, take it easy.

96
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,503
lf your father considers
you unfit, take it easy.

97
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:31,541
lf a bald man go to Tirupathi
take it easy.

98
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,495
Listen! Rathi, Rathi.

99
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,990
There are 6,00,000 nerves
in a human body.

100
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,659
Do you know friend?

101
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,233
Where is the nerve of love?

102
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,889
There is no love at first sight.

103
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,322
Eyes don't shed blood.

104
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,792
A cat is not a lion...

105
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,363
No man is like 'Ram'.

106
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:59,329
Without a revolt, woman can't
get what she wants.

107
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,904
Only Kannagi has a statue.

108
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,439
There is no statue for Sita.

109
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:10,379
lf Kannagi doesn't bother about you,
take it easy.

110
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,347
lf an old lady sits next to you,
take it easy.

111
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:20,317
lf a festival falls on a Sunday,
take it easy.

112
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:25,422
lf your lover calls you brother,
take it easy.

113
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:55,016
What's the benefit of winking in
darkness, without seeing your lover.

114
00:14:55,294 --> 00:15:00,095
What's the benefit being in heaven,
without independence.

115
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,236
No point in attending classes, without
beautiful girls.

116
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:10,204
No point in enjoying at 60
when you haven't, at 20.

117
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:20,342
He's calling you.

118
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,884
Hey, l'm the College Chairman.

119
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,983
Only l should call for a strike.

120
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,420
lt's not a strike by students
but by lecturers, boss.

121
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,186
A one day strike, demanding
a hike in salary.

122
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,624
Okay, let's enjoy.

123
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,564
Whoever wants to take a nap under
the tree, can do so.

124
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,994
Whoever wants to watch a
Malayalam movie, can do so.

125
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,566
Whoever wants to grind flour for the
next door lady, can do so.

126
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,169
Come Mangala, let's go for
a matinee show.

127
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:39,769
Then, what do l do?

128
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:40,836
Go & beg.

129
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,334
What's this?

130
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,965
All of you be seated.

131
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,840
Nobody should go anywhere.

132
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,046
Danu! -Yes buddy.

133
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,716
Go & close the gate.
-What for?

134
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,747
Because of the elections
held last week...

135
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,478
The walls have been defaced
by paintings & posters.

136
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,350
No body came to clean,
even when asked to.

137
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,956
Today, we have an opportunity
to clean them.

138
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,319
Kindly co-operate with me.

139
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,103
Come on guys, let's go outside.

140
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:13,963
Hey Prabhu....

141
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,432
Babu is trying to escape.

142
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,274
Who's it?

143
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,806
Deranged Babu.....

144
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,500
The one who stood for the post of
Chairman & lost to you.

145
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:20,838
That fellow, look there.

146
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,142
Come guys.

147
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,248
Does he think he is a big man?

148
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,612
Should l carry out his orders?
Come let's go.

149
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,051
What's it?
-Aren't we all working here?

150
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,382
How can you guys go away?
Come & clean.

151
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,617
Are you flaunting your chairmanship
in front of girls?

152
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,817
Find someone else.

153
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:43,023
Look here Babu, if you leave,
others will follow suit.

154
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,132
Don't disturb the team-spirit.
Come & clean.

155
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,795
Get lost. Don't think you're very smart.
Get lost.

156
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,812
How dare you lay your hands one me?
Try it again...

157
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,420
By posing this way, do you think
you are a Jackie Chang?

158
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,383
Are you trying to act smart
in front of me?

159
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,151
No Babu, let's not
fight unnecessarily.

160
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,322
Listen to me.

161
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,827
What did you say? A fight!
Will you hit me?

162
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,220
Oh My God!

163
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,628
Hey! You don't have to do it.
Go & sit. Give it to me.

164
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,816
Hey! Yesterday you were signaling
at that window.

165
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,080
Now you are signaling at this window.

166
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,723
That is 'biblig'.

167
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:53,923
This is 'bigba'.

168
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:55,721
What's it?

169
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:57,923
What does this mean?

170
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,423
Hey, don't call yourself an
Arts College student.

171
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,996
You don't even know the
code language.

172
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,828
There are 3 types of women.

173
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,828
Best, okay, worst.

174
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,337

00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,972

185
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,543
l wish this was my room.

186
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,046
Only guys, who don't know to ogle girls
get to see pretty girls.

187
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,147
Hey Prabhu...

188
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:58,586
You take part in all activities
except ogling girls, why is it?

189
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,950
l'm not interested.

190
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,827
You should automatically get sensation,
when you see a girl.

191
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,196
For that you may've to wait for years.

192
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,724
Till date, l've never felt
like that with women.

193
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:15,536
But, when l'm sitting idle or
when l'm half asleep.

194
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:21,404
l see a leg with anklets

195
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,747
An ear with a dangling ear ring.

196
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,016
Beautiful eyes..

197
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:37,622
Lips...

198
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,991
l don't know who or what or
where she is?

199
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,604
Whether, l'll see her or not
l don't know, anything.

200
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,500
At present she's my sweet heart..

201
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,176
Buddy, is she in the
category of chick.

202
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,010
For this year's
college day celebration..

203
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,348
We will invite the Governor
to be our Chief Guest.

204
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,958

206
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,305
Okay, you can go.

207
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,240
What's inside your trousers?

208
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,603
Don't ask such dirty questions.

209
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,611
Take off your trousers.

210
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:11,578
Okay, go.

211
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,965
One small request.
-Tell me.

212
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,368
Please do not narrate this incident
to our college girls.

213
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,978
lt will spoil my image.

214
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:37,742
l'll try not to tell them.

215
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,350
l needed this.

216
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,686
How many times l told you all,
to invite Actress Kushboo.

217
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,823
Did anyone listen to me?

218
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,621
Don't add fuel to the fire.

219
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,489
For suggesting Actress Roja's name
the Principal came to hit me.

220
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,355
Damn it.

221
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,324
Hey! Anjali stop!

222
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,091
What do you want?

223
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,198
Turn right & go.

224
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,360
Hey Anjali! Where are you...

225
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,267
Greetings.

226
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,848
Please take your seats...

227
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,351
You all have invited me for a
college day function, isn't it?

228
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,424
Yes sir! - On which date is it?

229
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:42,030
From the 24th to 30th of this month
whenever you are free...

230
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,766
Yes, you can fix it on 28th.

231
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,181
Not only did her hair get
knotted up, my heart also.

232
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:10,903
Oh My dear! Oh My dear!
l've lost my heart.

233
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:18,107
l've forgotten even the
place where l lost it.

234
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,213
Thinking, l lost it amongst
your anklet.

235
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:26,050
l've come in search of it
in your foot prints.

236
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:33,259
l came to know that love is a torture
after seeing you.

237
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:41,132
l'm neck deep in love & my
eyes are popping out.

238
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:25,572
The language & my mother tongue
don't seem to be mingling.

239
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:32,822
There is something moving
within me without any form.

240
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:40,128
lf you keep longing, minutes
become years.

241
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:47,567
l feel as if all the eyes are
watching me & l'm nervous.

242
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,673
ls this heaven or hell?

243
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,969
Tell me the truth.

244
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:02,679
My life & death depends
on your words.

245
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:57,999
Oh Cuckoo! lf you call me, l'll worship
you & wink at you.

246
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:05,443
Oh Divine! Monolith, l'll put you on
my lap & play with your tresses.

247
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:12,612
Oh Moon! l'll put to sleep &
crack your toes.

248
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:20,226
l'll filter & send all the breeze
that come towards you.

249
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:27,461
l'll whisper my need
into your ears.

250
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:35,310
From your foot print design
l'll evolve a new poem.

251
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,828
How many movies you must've seen?

252
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,653
Even the warrior's daughter's lover
to threatned with knives & sickles.

253
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,830
You have chosen
Kakarla's daughter.

254
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,831
People won't come for you
with knives & sickles.

255
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,336
But, they'll come with
AK 47 rifle.

256
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,732
Hey, whether it is Kakarla's daughter
or a clerk's daughter....

257
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,268
There's always opposition to love.

258
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,405
Can we afford to get
scared of it?

259
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,869
What's necessary for love?
Guts!

260
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,735
Guys like us should've guts
to up hold love.

261
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,737
Buddy, there's a limit
for the demand.

262
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,845
Did you see that girl?

263
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,683
She looks so gorgeous....

264
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,948
Whereas, he is not even worth 1/4 kg of flesh,

265
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,913
...and looks like a fully chewed gum.

266
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,349
Some amount of personality is
needed to fall in love.

267
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,958
Yuck! personality...what personality?

268
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,760
You don't need personality to fall in love.
lt only calls for a heart.

269
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,931
Can't you see the trouble l go
through with such a strong personality?

270
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:34,898
Who said that girls fall only for guys like
Actors Prashant & Aravindswamy.

271
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:39,634
Even the punny guys with long bags &
high powered spectacles,

272
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,306
...don't they roam around with good
looking girls?

273
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,880
What's the reason behind that?

274
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,312
They've the stuff.

275
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,377
lf you've the stuff, any type of girl
will fall in love with you.

276
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:53,114
Buddy, this useless fellow is boosting
you. Don't believe him.

277
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,386
Look there.

278
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,794
Those waves have washed away the
sand castle.

279
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:00,723
What does that imply?

280
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,926
lt implies that, same thing will
happen to your love also.

281
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,394
Hey, are you directing a scene?

282
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,729
Keep quiet, you stupid fellow.

283
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,405
Hey, you are watching that boy,
but l'm watching this one.

284
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,574
He's chasing for the same crab.

285
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,746
His thoughts are fully
on that crab only.

286
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,576
He'll definitely catch that crab.
He won't go without it.

287
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,016
That's it, efforts never fail.

288
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,284
Prabhu, your girl friend....
that Kakarla's daughter...

289
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,927
By the time l had gathered
information about her,

290
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,697
...l had become half deaf.

00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,111
She is doing her ''Home Science''
in Stella Maris College.

297
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,613
lt's a ladies college.
No one can get in.

298
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,789
Even the security is also woman.

299
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,785
ln the morning, she goes for yoga.
Even there, men are not allowed.

300
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,959

There're 48 policemen & 4 dogs
guarding her house.

304
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,806
Not even a fly can enter the house.

305
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,633
Not only that,

306
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,477
...there're 2 Commandos always
guarding her,

307
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,645
...like Oxen.

308
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,478
l've put forth everything l know.

309
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,482
How & when are you going to
cross all these hurdles?

310
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,316
Do you think it's not possible?

311
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,313
lt's difficult.

313
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,660
Between 4 & 6 in the evening.

Do you remember me?

316
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,398
How can she forget you.
You had touched her heart, isn't it?

317
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,234
Jai
-Joe.

318
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:50,900
He is always like that.

319
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,065
Making fun.

But we never expected,

324
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,241
...to meet you here.

325
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:04,748
We are freshers.

326
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,749
lf we've doubts in dance movements,
you can clarify it, isn't it.

327
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,920
As we have become good friends.

We've good teachers here.

329
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,258
lf you've any doubts, they'll
clear it for you.

330
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,593
Driver! Start the car.

331
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,925
Oh! ls this your car?
-Yes.

332
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:19,926
Maruthi 1000, isn't it?

There is a ''G'' on it which
stands for Government.

00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,434
How many 9's are there from 1 to 100?

00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,434
For what?
-To stick it.

337
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,604
lt is a psychological question.
Please tell me.

Totally, there're 20 nine's.

342
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,467
Driver, start the car.

343
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:09,643
He has lots of stuff like Sardar jokes,
cockroach stories &,

344
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,975
...''Don't miss things'', pulse reading.
we'll teach you all this.

345

00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,507
90, 91 , 92, 93, 94, 95...

348
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,526
Oh! you've changed the car.

349
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:03,531
Premier Padmini, isn't it? 1-1-1-1 .
Not even a single 9.

350
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,370
l think that 9 has disturbed you a lot.

351
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,046
l think the teacher has
not come today.

352
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,882
Then, we can keep our uniforms
inside & be in our casuals.

353
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:28,047
Ask him to come soon....

354
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:33,219
Hey, if you keep oogling like this,
when are you planning to get closer.

355
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,729
Shouldn't we do something
to win her heart?

356
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,068
Hey, she puts up a long face
whenever l go near her.

357
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,571
Leave it. Lets do something
to cool her down.

358
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,072
How is her dance?

359
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,575
Excellent! ls this excellent?

360
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,740
For years together they're
calling him.

361
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,084
They don't have an answer for
why he hasn't come.

362
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,082
Why don't they just ring him up
& call him. Why should we dance?

363
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,414
This is old fashion.

364
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,588
Except this...

365
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,988
Not only today or tomorrow
it's always the same.

366
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,491
Whether it's morning or evening
there is no change.

367
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,993
Let's forget our worries.

368
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,333
Let's keep our anger aside.

369
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,165

We can compose tunes.

372
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,336
Who is first, who is first
first...first.

373
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,709
Whether it's money or cash,
we've only one life.

374
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,878
One wife is enough for me.

375
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,373
Let us keep our hearts open.

376
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,875
Let us see, what'll we get.

377
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,712
Whatever is designated for you is yours.

378
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,047
Be happy with what you get.

379
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:17,554
Whatever happens is for the best.
Good times will come, good times will come.

00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,819
...not enough...not enough...

383
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,084
For 5 paise or 10 paise

384
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,591
We break the hundi.

385
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,596
Borrow 25 paise or 50 paise from somewhere.

00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,604
Pledged vessels & big pots.

387
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,834
But, still it is not enough...

388
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:12,038
Wisdom fruit! Wisdom fruit.

389
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:17,119
You're Sevaipettai wisdom fruit.

Their movies are running
full house in theatres.

396
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:45,875
Who is it?

397
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:53,213
This is Natyalaya, where dance is God
& School is the temple.

398
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,715
How dare you dance so cheaply
in this temple?

399
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:58,621
lsn't this arrogance?

400
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,456
Do you know what is Bharathanatiyam?

401
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:18,697
This is Bharathanatiyam.

402
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:23,035
lt is not as easy as
adding 9 & 10.

403
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,535
6 years.....6 years...
l've toiled & learnt it.

404
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:27,539
Can you dance like this?

405
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,709
lf you can, make an attempt
to dance like this.

406
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,208
Atleast, don't insult the people
who dance.

407
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,548
''Bharathanatiyam is divine''.

408
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,220
lt's not a rouge's dance.

409
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:47,725
What's this my son?

410
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,991
Have you crusified yourself?

411
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:51,226
What is this?

412
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,004
What is this? Show it to me.
-Nothing.

413
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,236
Show it to me?

414
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,905
lt's personal.

415
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:05,245
What personal...? l'm your father.
Show it, let me see.

416
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,079
lt is personal.

417
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,857
Oh! ls it really personal?

418
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,519
Bring Rs.200.

419
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,095
Here, hold this.

420
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,694
Why is this new habit? ls it to
spoil our son?

421
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:26,602
Look here.

422
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,435
When he was young, we gave him brandy
to get relief from cold.

423
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:30,598
Has he got spoilt.

424
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,443
Oh! you still haven't
squeezed the lime?

425
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,946
2 limes are in the bag.
Cut them and bring it.

426
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:37,943
Go & bring it.

427
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,953
Take it, dear.

428
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:45,280
No need, father.

429
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,455
Okay, l'll turn that side.
Have it.

430
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,075
Eyes with the brightness of sun.

431
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:13,405
Let moonlight be the woman.

432
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,243
Redness of the mars.

433
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,922
With all these, she walked graciously.

434
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:24,919
Father!

435
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,429
Yesterday, our eyes met.

436
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,758
Today, we're walking by
holding our hands.

437
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,263
From tomorrow, l'll be with you.

438
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:43,105
Following like a shadow behind you.

439
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:46,507
Come....

440
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,117
Come my son.

441
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,619
Don't cry, don't cry like a child.

442
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,449
Your father is there for you.

443
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:01,864
Who is that girl?

444
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:03,691
Sruthi.

445
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,200
Does she live is our quarters?
-No.

446
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,697
ls she studying with you?
-No.

447
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,478
Then what...
-Kakarla...

ls she working in Kakarla's house?

449
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:24,150
No father. -ls she the daughter of
someone who's working in Kakarla's house?

450
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:31,154
No. -Does she stay behind Kakarla's
house? What's it?

451
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:34,756
Who is it?

452
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,001
Are you in love with Kakarla's
daughter? What's it?

453
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,171
Yes father.
-What?

454
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,502
Yes father.

455
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,518
Okay. You're in love with
Kakarla's daughter.

456
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,516
Nothing wrong in it.

457
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,522
She is also a girl.

458
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,788
lf you fall in love with a girl,
you should act according to her desires.

459
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,359
What does that girl like?
She likes Bharathanatiyam.

460
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,364
You also learn it.

461
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,196
Prove, that you're not
a rouge dancer,

462
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,198
...and that you can learn
Bharathanatiyam also.

463
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,037
Then, she herself will come &
talk to you.

464
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,036
Prabhu, what're you thinking?

465
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,037
ls it about when to learn, how to talk
& when to fall in love?

466
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,046
You can, you can...

467
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,378
Nothing is impossible for humans.

468
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,713
Believe that someday the girl will be your's.

469
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,385
Love will teach you everything.

470
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,726
lt will give you the
strength to win anything.

471
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,420
You all stay here.
-Okay sir.

472
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:23,758
l'll perform the obsequies &
come back.

473
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,855
What is it Shankaraswamy?

474
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,355
Mr.Kakarla, where is the
80 crores we gave you?

475
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,519
lt's safe in my house.

476
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,522
Did we give you 80 crores to keep
it in your house?

477
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,522
Listen.

478
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,692
We don't like the government
ruling your state.

479
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,026
That government should be dismissed.

480
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,527
Our party should capture power.

481
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:03,031
For that, we gave you money to buy
8 ministers & 27 M.L.A.'s.

482
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,538
But you have swindled the money &
not made an attempt to dismiss it.

483
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,868
What the hell are you
doing in Kasi?

484
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,375
Should a Government be dismissed
only by buying ministers & M.L.A.'s.

485
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,705
Can't we dismiss the Government
because of Law & Order deterioration?

486
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,882
When will the law & order deteriorate?

487
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,050
When there is violence.

488
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,881
When will there be violence?

489
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,386
When there is a bomb blast.

490
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,722
lnstead of buying people,

491
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,729
...isn't arranging for a bomb blast
a good idea?

492
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,728
Last week at the market complex,

493
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,900
...there was a bomb blast
killing several people.

494
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,066
Whom do you think who
masterminded it?

495
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,063
Kakarla!

496
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,905
Kakarla Sathyanaryanana.

497
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,912
What're you saying!

498
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,910
Do you want me to give 80 crores
to M.L.A & get nothing?

499
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,085
You told me to dismiss the Government.

500
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,750
lt'll happen some how.
Now you can clear the place.

501
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,091
lf this news leaks out,
you, me and...

502
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,755
...my senior leaders
will be in trouble?

503
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:57,923
Don't be afraid.

504
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,596
My position is a respectable position.

505
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,425
Nobody will ever suspect me.

506
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,435
Not only that, already there exists
a lot confusion here.

507
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,765
Muslims detest Hindus,
Christians detest Muslims.

508
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,941
Bhramins detest Vanniyars,
Vanniyars detest Harijans.

509
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,271
One caste of people don't like another.

510
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,782
When there is so much confusion
over here,

511
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,618
...are they going to blame me
for the blast?

512
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:27,116
Hey, is it fair to kill people for the
sake of earning money?

513
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,553
This Sathyanarayanana is
a noble person.

514
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,124
Have you seen a murderer doing
obsequies for the dead people?

515
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,299
l'm performing the last rites for all
those who died in the bomb blast.

516
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,801
That too, in Kasi.

517
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,805
Go...go & assure your seniors that
the Government will be dismissed.

518
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,312
Even this year in Chidambaram,
Natyanjali function is going to be organised.

519
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,973
Natyanjali means....

520
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,312
Where all dance artists from various
parts of the world,

521
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:59,383
...come together & they've the habit
to respect to the God of dance, Nataraj.

522
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,916
What & who're all going to perform
on behalf of our Natyalaya?

523
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,255
Madam, Andal Dance.

524
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,320
The marriage of Valli.

525
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,330
The story of Kannagi who
burnt Madurai.

526
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,657
Dance of Lord Shiva.

527
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,993
Vasanth, what about you?

528
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,329
Lord Krishna who plays
flute in forest.

529
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,334
Oh! ls it Krishna's story?

530
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,007
Prabhu, what about you?

531
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,402
Apart from them...

532
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,266
l'm going to perform something new.

533
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,010
By mixing Bharatnatiyam & Kuchipudi.

534
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,671
l'm going to depict a beggar,
begging in scorching heat,

535
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,843
...& infront of a car at the signal
& with a child in her hand.

536
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,177
l'm going to dance for 10 minutes.

537
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,177
This dance...

538
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:33,420
...will depict the poverty
& the sorrow of our country very clearly.

539
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,354
l'm not coming to Chidambaram.

540
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,025
Why?

541
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,188
By dancing ''Pettai Rap'', hasn't he earned
enough insult for Natyalaya?

542
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,231
Now, what is this Kuchipudi
scorching heat, beggar etc.

543
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,098
Let's not get insulted
in Chidambaram also.

544
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:48,866
l'm not coming.

545
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,039
lf Sruthi doesn't come,
l'm also not coming.

546
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:50,865
l'm also not coming.

547
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,305
l'm not coming.

548
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,209
l never excepted so much
of opposition.

549
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,779
How can l perform when so
many don't like.

550
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:01,781
l'm not coming to Chidambaram.

551
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:27,803
Why're you scared?

552
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,736
Evil's.
-Get lost.

553
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:14,967
You abused me of dancing
''Rouge dance'', isn't it?

554
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:16,969
Can a rouge dance like this?

555
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,081
Can he sketch like this?

556
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,918
l'm not a rowdy who goes
behind girls.

557
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,115
l don't know that you're Kakarla's
daughter whom l shouldn't see.

558
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,750
When l saw the face which
l had dreamt...

559
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,089
l started loving you.

560
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,460
l didn't join Natyalaya
to learn dance.

561
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,262
But to see, talk & be with you.

562
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,530
Bharathanatiyam may be
important for you.

563
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,200
But you're important for me.

564
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:49,107
Your face.....is deeply impressed
in my blood cell.

565
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,881
That's why, your face has been sketched
through my legs.

566
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,786
You've taken 6 years
to learn this dance.

567
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,815
lf l could learn it so fast,

568
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,792
....lt's because of love.

569
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:05,885
The love, l've on you.

570
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:50,168
Our lndia, may be diverse
in religion & caste but...

571
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,006
l'll take leave.

572
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,936
Where?
-To Chidambaram.

573
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,670
Chidambaram!
-Yes father.

574
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,181
At the Chidambaram Nataraj Temple
there is a Natyanjali function tomorrow.

575
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,675
l'm getting ready to leave
for that only.

576
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,218
Law & Order situation is not good.

577
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,357
Kidnapping minister's daughter
killing VlPs...

578
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,420
Likewise, there're a lot of terrorist activities.

579
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,519
At this time, l can't send 50
policemen for your security.

580
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,202
Father, they'll all be
waiting for me.

581
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:21,703
You shouldn't go.

582
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:39,979
Sruthi has come.

583
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,892
Welcome Sruthi, why so late?

584
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,125
l'm not coming to Chidambaram.
-Why?

585
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,790
Father told me not to go.

586
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,390
Oh God! Without you....

587
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,124
lt's okay madam.
l'll participate next year.

588
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,394
You carry on.

589
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,905
Madam, did you see them?
Till yesterday, they were refusing to come.

590
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,474
Today, they've left you
in a lurch.

591
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,477
We're your true friends.

592
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:25,158
Your dance last might was excellent.

593
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:30,030
ln such a..in such a short period
...it's really great.

594
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,108
Have this.

595
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,857
This excellent piece should not
be destroyed by air or water.

596
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,625
That's why, l photographed it.

597
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,402
Did you see the game of fate?

598
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:07,332
l asked you not to come.
But now, l could'nt make it.

599
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,736
Natyanjali is going to be held tomorrow.

600
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:13,338
lf l had gone, this would've been
the 7th year without a break.

601
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,544
l've missed it.

602
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:15,874
What to do?

603
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,482
Do you feel like going?

604
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,079
Yes, l do. But how is it possible?

605
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:22,483
We can go by my bike.

606
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:23,882
By bike?

607
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:25,885
lf we take the beach road
we go to....

608
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,161
lt will just take 5 hours.

609
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,333
Won't there be any problem?

610
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,827
lf there is a problem, it'll be
through your father only.

611
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,502
Just tell him a sorry.
lt'll be okay.

612
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:38,162
Taking you carefully & bringing
you back is left to me.

613
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:38,999
Left to us.

614
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,673
Okay, what do we do with
these commandos?

615
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,345
Leave that to me.
They're useless fellows.

616
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,511
A lemon is enough to scare them.
-Why?

617
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:48,513
Just do what l say.

618
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,014
lnform your father that, you'll practice
dance & then get back.

619
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,682
Wait, till l'm back.

620
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,792
She has come, she has come....

621
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:05,367
Quick!

622
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,371
Start the bike.

623
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,291
Wow! lsn't their dress superb?

624
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,722
Do you like that dress?
-Yes.

625
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,300
Hey, look there. A Fisherwoman in Jeans.

626
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,856
Prabhu, commandos are following us.

627
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,803
This is Chidambaram Temple.

628
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,538
This's the 1000 pillar hall, where
Natyanjali will take place.

629
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:29,883
As per your instructions,
l've kept the bomb there.

630
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,955
This is a 1000 year old stone building,
not a building built with cement.

631
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,021
Remember that.

632
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,123
This Mallikarjun is not a fool.

633
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,463
Keeping the area in mind,
l've increased the quantity of RDX.

634
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:52,539
The formulae weighs
7 1/2 RDX, 800 cbase.

635
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,569
When it blasts, it can be
heard in & around 20 kms.

636
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,473
Atleast 400 people will perish.

637
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,306
When will the bomb blast?

638
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:03,812
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.,
all dancers seek their teacher's blessings.

639
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:08,054
At 10,30 a.m., each one will
perform on stage.

640
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,391
Exactly at 10.40 a.m., the bomb will blast.

641
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,513
Sir, l'm commando Ajay speaking.

642
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,185
Without our knowledge, your daughter,

643
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,946
...with two unknown persons is going
beyond city limits in a motor cycle.

644
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,189
Which side?

645
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,080
Chidambaram route!

646
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,295
Were you all whiling away your time?

647
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,031
Be on the line.

648
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,299
Sir..sir...please stop.

649
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,631
Sir wants to see you again.

650
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,303
Close all the check posts.

651
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,537
My daughter should not
go to Chidambaram.

652
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,583
Hey, Vasanth.
-What? -Come down.

653
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,719
Prabhu for the first time
you're going with a girl.

654
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,653
Why should l intrude?

655
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,258
That's why, l've to do this this.
Let's meet in Chidambaram. You carry on.

656
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:22,889
Remove it.

657
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:27,796
Yes!
-Why?

658
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,595
Don't ask questions. Just remove it.

659
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,069
Are you joking?

660
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,909
lt is not a wreath for you to
keep & take as you please.

661
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,136
lt is a bomb. lt is 7 1/2 kg RDX.

662
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,346
Malli, my daughter has
gone to Chidambaram.

663
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,082
Remove it.

664
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,749
lt is easy to keep it,
but difficult to remove.

665
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,088
l'll be destroyed, if
l mishandle it.

666
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:51,020
l won't even be as much as the ball
of rice you keep at Kasi.

667
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,597
Malli, what you need is money, isn't it?
l'll also pay for removing it.

668
01:08:56,632 --> 01:09:00,090
l'll pay twice as much as
l paid for placing it.

669
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,291
Then, give it to me right now.

670
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:09,738
lf you don't remove it
after taking the money?

671
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,939
You also come with me.
Both of us will go & remove it.

672
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,944
l'm your saviour now.

673
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,011
You've no choice, but to trust me.

674
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,953
God never deceives people
who trusts him.

675
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:44,263
Are uncle & aunty fine?
Are the fishes in the pond fine?

676
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,701
Dear, ls the one who brought us up...

677
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,741
Hey...where're you going?

678
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,138
Stop..stop...Hey, Chidambaram
is in this side.

679
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:56,206
Hey, l've to goto Chidambaram.

Yuck! get down.

681
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:58,553
Oh My God! he has ditched me.

682
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,791
Won't l find a fool to
take me on his way.

683
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:11,118
Then, l'll come and overtake you.

01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:13,787

Come.
-Oh God! it's not me.

687

688
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,893
Have you ever tried to perform
somersault with your bike in air?

689
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:21,898
Please, try now.

690
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,589
Oh God! Sir...he's riding
the bike in mid air.

691
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,155
Oh Mother!

692
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,391
That fool has taken away the bike.

693
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,714
Move away, move away
....give me away.

694
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,758
Prabhu, l'm feeling hungry.

695
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,361
l've spent all the money
for repairing the bike.

696
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:28,824
What to do now?

697
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:34,766
Prabhu, l'm starving.
l'm starving like hell.

698
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:41,973
Wait. l'll be back in 10 minutes.

699
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,777
Who is it? Who is stealing
the groundnuts?

700
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,179
Thief! catch him.

701
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:01,848
Food is ready!

702
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:10,798
Root plant, groundnuts &
bird eggs. Have them.

703
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:14,535
You also have it.

704
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,142
lt's very nice.

705
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,010
What happened?

706
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,826
Wow! l was worried that there
is no non-veg.

707
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:45,958
How to cook it?

708
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,233
Yuck! Do you eat this also?

709
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:52,933
lf you confess your love,
l'll eat this alive.

710
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,239
Eat properly.

711
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:02,416
Have it.

712
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:08,250
What is this?

713
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,823
This is Taj Mahal made out of
palm leaves specially for you.

714
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:11,717
Yuck!

715
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:12,651
Sleep.

716
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:14,492
Where to sleep?
-Here only.

717
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:15,355
Here?

718
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,331
On the floor?

719
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:24,429
Get up.
-For what?

720
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,334
Get up, dear.

721
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,048
What're you going to do after
removing my saree?

722
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,442
Come & see.

723
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:38,185
How can l come out with this?

724
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:59,773
l made a box with palm leaves
in the garden.

725
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:06,247
Were you born to store &
eat sugar from it?

726
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,553
ln the hanging cradle
from the branches.

727
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,480
With the lullaby sung by your lover.

728
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:37,144
Queen, who left the palace,
please go to sleep.

729
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:08,198
Hey, little boy.

730
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:09,644
Have you gone to sleep?

731
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:15,207
Acting! Acting as if he is asleep.

732
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:20,145
He is sleeping.

733
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:22,724
Look at the way he is sleeping.

734
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,949
Like a baby with a beard.

735
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:30,386
Hey, do you like Sruthi?

736
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,132
Do you love her very much?

737
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,299
Will you do anything for her?

738
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,797
Look at this face? Monkey!

739
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:45,503
With just 4 kg bone wrapped
in 2 meters of skin.

740
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,414
Do you want Kakarla's daughter?

741
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:55,880
lnjust one day, you've
stirred my heart.

742
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,653
You toiled & got me so many things.

743
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:03,328
Eggs, plant, groundnuts.

744
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,632
l've never had a dinner like
this in my life.

745
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:12,262
l've never been so happy
& independent.

746
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,508
Even my mother has not taken
such good care of me.

747
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,305
You ran for me so much.

748
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:20,942
lsn't all this for me?

749
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:23,747
Just, for me to go to
Chidambaram, isn't it?

750
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,817
Just for me to say
l Love you, isn't it?

751
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:29,986
l won't tell you now.

752
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:33,319
After l finish my dance in
Chidambaram tomorrow.

753
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,222
Before going home...

754
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:39,896
ln a lonely place. l'll whisper
in your ears that l love you.

755
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:42,603
Okay....

756
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:51,972
lt's nice.

757
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,640
Hey, this is not for eating
but for brushing your teeth.

758
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,507
Should we brush our
teeth in this?
-Yes...

759
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:58,811
For the time being this is
the tooth powder.

760
01:20:59,020 --> 01:20:59,816
What about the brush?

761
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:01,550
This is the brush?

762
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:03,986
ls this the brush?

763
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:10,392
Prabhu, l had never used this brush.

764
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,226
Why don't you brush my tooth?

765
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,631
Hey, you don't shake your head.

766
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,142
Open your mouth.

767
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:31,917
Oh My God! My brush...
my brush...leave it.

768
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:45,521
Finish your bath & come fast.

769
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:46,894
lt's getting late for Natanjali.

770
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,563
l'm feeling shy, Prabhu.

771
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:51,130
There's nobody here.

772
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,670
Even l've turned this side.

773
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,240
What's there to feel shy?

774
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,604
A sparrow is staring at me.

775
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:02,011
That is a blind sparrow,
you bathe & come.

776
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,547
You're making fun of me, isn't it?

777
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:06,513
l'm used to bathing in the bathroom.

778
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:10,386
l'm feeling shy to bathe in this
open place.

779
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:11,957
That's not a problem at all.

780
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:14,519
Go down, count 100 &
then look around you.

781
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,310
l'm Mali speaking.

782
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,010
What happened?
Have you removed it?

783
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,211
l couldn't do it.

784
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:18,659
My leg broke in a car accident.

785
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:20,590
What about Sruthi?

786
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,023
lt's you, who has to do
something about it.

787
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,122
Damn it.

788
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,764
Sruthi has come.

789
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,927
Sruthi, you said you won't come,
How did you come?

790
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:31,196
l'll tell you about it later.

791
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,203
Hey Meena, give me your dance dress.

792
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:34,874
Okay, come in.
l'll give it to you.

793
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:55,897
There's a bomb in the Natyanjali
Dance Hall at Chidambaram.

794
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,689
lt'll blast as soon as the
function starts.

795
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,360
Remove it at the earliest.

796
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,327
Who're you?

797
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,437
That's not important.

798
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:05,600
This information is true.

799
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:48,107
Come madam, let's go.

800
01:26:22,617 --> 01:26:23,242
lt's there.

801
01:26:39,901 --> 01:26:41,391
Sir, l'm Commando Ajay speaking.

802
01:26:41,603 --> 01:26:43,594
The bomb has been removed.
Your daughter is also safe.

803
01:26:43,872 --> 01:26:45,567
Being her immediately here
by Helicopter.

804
01:26:46,408 --> 01:26:47,238
What about those 2 boys?

805
01:26:47,709 --> 01:26:48,198
Leave them.

806
01:26:48,977 --> 01:26:51,309
Without knowing the reason
let's not trouble them.

807
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,308
Bring back Sruthi first.

808
01:28:49,164 --> 01:28:51,428
This cartoon needs no dialogue.

809
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,797
Daddy, where is the button?

810
01:28:53,968 --> 01:28:54,525
What?

811
01:28:54,836 --> 01:28:55,803
l had kept a button on this paper.

812
01:28:57,705 --> 01:29:03,701
l came...took the paper...
Shook it & laughed.

813
01:29:04,012 --> 01:29:05,377
Father, you're highly irresponsible.

814
01:29:09,684 --> 01:29:10,912
Who changed your night shift?

815
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:12,211
Why don't you go to the
Police Station.

816
01:29:13,087 --> 01:29:13,644
Damn it.

817
01:29:15,857 --> 01:29:17,290
Who is bothered if you
read the paper or not?

818
01:29:20,195 --> 01:29:22,254
Don't simply keep shouting, search.

819
01:29:23,364 --> 01:29:25,298
lnterruptions! - Did l shout?

820
01:29:26,334 --> 01:29:26,823
Move your legs.

821
01:29:27,268 --> 01:29:30,237
Why're you creating hub hub
for a small button?

822
01:29:30,705 --> 01:29:32,002
Father, it is an important button.

823
01:29:34,075 --> 01:29:36,873
Oh! ls it your girl's button?

824
01:29:38,046 --> 01:29:41,709
l took this...Shook it..

825
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:55,086
You can go.

826
01:30:01,736 --> 01:30:04,637
Hey, stop the vehicle, stop.

827
01:30:19,888 --> 01:30:22,379
l've got all the important buttons
from the garbage vehicle.

828
01:30:27,762 --> 01:30:29,024
This is it!

829
01:30:30,999 --> 01:30:31,829
How did you find out, son?

830
01:30:32,033 --> 01:30:34,092
That day she was wearing
an orange top.

831
01:31:24,852 --> 01:31:27,412
Whatever your girl
touches & throws,

832
01:31:27,622 --> 01:31:30,090
Even if it is Copper
it becomes Gold.

833
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:33,616
ln your girl's blushing face.

834
01:31:33,828 --> 01:31:36,194
Even pimples are corals.

835
01:31:36,931 --> 01:31:39,695
Even her sweat is holy water.

836
01:31:40,101 --> 01:31:42,695
Even your glance at me
is my salvation.

837
01:31:43,571 --> 01:31:48,907
Music of love...
is a wake up call for earth.

838
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,560
Even if my love just scribbles.

839
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:51,295
lt'll appear like a poem.

840
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:55,104
Love does not seek cleanliness.

841
01:32:55,309 --> 01:32:57,607
Saliva is also holy.

842
01:32:58,146 --> 01:33:00,910
Jasmine is Rs.2.

843
01:33:01,449 --> 01:33:04,145
But if it falls from your tress
it is worth millions.

844
01:33:04,352 --> 01:33:07,014
Sweet Candy is Rs.5,

845
01:33:07,455 --> 01:33:10,481
But, the half you gave after
eating is worth a lakh.

846
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:22,188
Love does not seek
auspicious time.

847
01:34:22,396 --> 01:34:24,887
Even unauspicious time is lucky.

848
01:34:25,733 --> 01:34:28,463
Love needs no swan
to carry messages.

849
01:34:28,703 --> 01:34:31,035
Even a crow can carry messages.

850
01:34:31,639 --> 01:34:34,267
The torch of love never goes off.

851
01:34:34,742 --> 01:34:37,734
Love is not afraid of anything.

852
01:34:38,012 --> 01:34:40,810
There's nothing silly about this.

853
01:34:41,015 --> 01:34:43,950
Nobody understood, this importance.

854
01:34:44,118 --> 01:34:47,281
Sky & earth may change.

855
01:34:47,488 --> 01:34:49,956
But love will remain stable.

856
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:56,127
The song sung by Adam & Eve
will always linger in the breeze.

857
01:34:56,531 --> 01:35:02,902
Others may say the word 'Love' is bad
but you must say today...

858
01:35:03,104 --> 01:35:07,165
Others may call love as a
fence of thorns.

859
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:09,502
Today, you should cross it.

860
01:35:41,042 --> 01:35:43,306
Since you were out for
2 days at Chidambaram.

861
01:35:43,611 --> 01:35:45,101
This small medical test.

862
01:35:46,347 --> 01:35:47,245
l'm perfectly normal.

863
01:35:47,715 --> 01:35:49,478
Let's conduct this for your
father's satisfaction.

864
01:35:52,887 --> 01:35:53,876
Give me Vaseline.

865
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:03,894
What're you doing?

866
01:36:04,765 --> 01:36:05,424
What kind of a check is this up?

867
01:36:10,171 --> 01:36:13,231
Your father has asked me to
do a virginity test.

868
01:36:28,322 --> 01:36:29,755
Don't shout & create a scene here.

869
01:36:30,124 --> 01:36:31,091
Co-operate with them.

870
01:36:32,126 --> 01:36:34,026
Who the hell are you to conduct
a virginity test on me?

871
01:36:35,029 --> 01:36:35,688
Get out of here.

872
01:36:38,966 --> 01:36:41,560
You've roamed around with some dogs,
without listening to me.

873
01:36:41,836 --> 01:36:42,734
How dare you scream now?

874
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:44,560
Look here.

875
01:36:45,139 --> 01:36:47,835
You're not any fool's daughter.

876
01:36:48,643 --> 01:36:49,940
To behave as your please.

877
01:36:54,548 --> 01:36:56,038
You're Kakarla Satyanarayana's
daughter.

878
01:36:56,684 --> 01:37:03,089
lf someone criticize me
or my family.

879
01:37:03,858 --> 01:37:05,291
lt is a disgrace for my position.

880
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:10,126
Father, l've not committed any mistake.

881
01:37:11,299 --> 01:37:13,028
Why're you trying to embarrass me?

882
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:16,569
l'm human. l'm your daughter.

883
01:37:18,706 --> 01:37:21,266
l trust you but not your age.

884
01:37:21,876 --> 01:37:24,811
l need to know right away whether
you are a virgin or not?

885
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:34,251
There is a point in what
your father says.

886
01:37:34,455 --> 01:37:35,945
Go ahead and check.

887
01:37:57,645 --> 01:38:00,079
To ''Allah Pitchai''
at ''Ginginika Palayam''.

888
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:05,841
Sir, you got only our postal department
to fool around isn't it?

889
01:38:06,187 --> 01:38:08,280
l've never heard of a place
called Ginginika Palayam.

890
01:38:09,056 --> 01:38:11,490
You've posted a letter to an existing
person in a non-existing place.

891
01:38:12,626 --> 01:38:13,957
l did not post this letter at all.

892
01:38:14,462 --> 01:38:16,896
Sender's name is Prabhu, Chairman.

893
01:38:17,098 --> 01:38:18,793
You are Prabhu, isn't it?
-Yes.

894
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:19,557
Hold it.

895
01:38:19,834 --> 01:38:21,199
What a way to begin a day?

896
01:38:35,816 --> 01:38:36,976
This is Sruti.

897
01:38:37,585 --> 01:38:42,784
Are you fine? l'm not
fine Prabhu, l'm not fine.

898
01:38:43,357 --> 01:38:46,485
l want to meet & speak to you alone.

899
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:48,288
l want to discuss a lot of things.

900
01:38:48,829 --> 01:38:51,662
Coming Sunday, my daddy
will not be in town.

901
01:38:52,266 --> 01:38:53,665
Saying that l have a sports rehearsal...

902
01:38:53,868 --> 01:38:55,961
l'll some how reach
Nehru stadium.

903
01:38:56,303 --> 01:38:58,430
Come inside without the knowledge
of others.

904
01:38:58,973 --> 01:38:59,940
Please come without fail.

905
01:39:15,489 --> 01:39:16,888
Will you marry me,
Prabhu?

906
01:39:19,894 --> 01:39:20,417
Tell me.

907
01:39:21,362 --> 01:39:22,488
Will you marry me?

908
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:24,459
What are you trying to say?

909
01:39:24,665 --> 01:39:25,927
Telling a man ''l love you'',

910
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:28,062
Brings lots of happiness to him.

911
01:39:29,303 --> 01:39:31,168
l am unable to provide even
that happiness to you.

912
01:39:31,772 --> 01:39:33,637
Just as if someone is strangling my
neck.

913
01:39:34,742 --> 01:39:36,403
l am asking you to marry me.

914
01:39:40,648 --> 01:39:42,343
But, l've no other alternative.

915
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,541
What is it Sruti?
What happened?

916
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:48,121
Just because l was
with you for a day in Chidambaram.

917
01:39:48,889 --> 01:39:50,254
To find out whether l am a virgin,

918
01:39:50,591 --> 01:39:52,183
They've conducted a test
by a doctor.

919
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:54,855
Henceforth, whenever
l come to meet you.

920
01:39:55,129 --> 01:39:55,959
They will conduct the test.

921
01:39:57,131 --> 01:39:58,325
Why should l stay there?

922
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:00,696
l don't like it.

923
01:40:01,769 --> 01:40:04,397
lf this had happened
before l had met you.

924
01:40:05,506 --> 01:40:06,495
l would have died.

925
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:08,840
Now, l don't even want to die.

926
01:40:11,445 --> 01:40:13,811
Okay, l'll marry you but before
that you...- No.

927
01:40:14,348 --> 01:40:16,475
Right now....here...at this place
...marry me.

928
01:40:16,684 --> 01:40:17,708
Sruthi don't be in a hurry.

929
01:40:17,952 --> 01:40:19,579
We should not make
a decision in haste.

930
01:40:20,154 --> 01:40:20,586
Be calm.

931
01:40:21,222 --> 01:40:23,656
Be it anger or happiness,
haughtiness or tears.

932
01:40:23,858 --> 01:40:25,155
Hold it in abeyance for 5 minutes.

933
01:40:25,459 --> 01:40:26,357
Your mind will settle down.

934
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,357
lt is important now to make a
decision in a proper state of mind.

935
01:40:28,596 --> 01:40:29,995
Speak after 5 minutes.

936
01:40:30,331 --> 01:40:31,389
l'll listen to whatever you say.

937
01:40:56,457 --> 01:40:59,824
Hey, leave me...l won't come home.

938
01:41:00,094 --> 01:41:03,359
Leave me, l'll never get back
to that house.

939
01:41:05,299 --> 01:41:06,027
Please listen to me.

940
01:41:14,308 --> 01:41:18,301
Leave me, l won't come.

941
01:41:40,734 --> 01:41:41,393
Sruthi, come.

942
01:43:58,405 --> 01:44:02,603
Leave me; l won't go back
to that house.

943
01:44:07,448 --> 01:44:09,075
Baskara -What is it uncle?

944
01:44:09,316 --> 01:44:11,409
Did you see Prabhu?
- No uncle.

945
01:44:19,927 --> 01:44:21,758
What happened Kathiresan?
why are you out in the rain?

946
01:44:21,895 --> 01:44:23,624
My son is missing
for the past two days.

947
01:44:23,864 --> 01:44:25,229
He will never go out without
informing us.

948
01:44:25,899 --> 01:44:27,890
lf he is away in the night
he'll definitely call us.

949
01:44:28,102 --> 01:44:29,865
No information at all.
l don't know where he is.

950
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:30,695
ls that so? - Yes.

951
01:44:30,904 --> 01:44:32,929
Okay, what is the point
in searching alone?

952
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:35,973
lnform our department also.
Shall l take leave?

953
01:44:36,176 --> 01:44:36,665
Okay.

954
01:44:37,611 --> 01:44:38,703
Where are you my son?

955
01:44:58,465 --> 01:44:59,124
Greetings madam.

956
01:45:13,347 --> 01:45:14,678
Are you the person
who placed the bomb?

957
01:45:16,316 --> 01:45:17,214
What is your name?

958
01:45:18,886 --> 01:45:21,286
With a face like a jammed jug.

959
01:45:21,655 --> 01:45:23,748
Your name is Prabhu isn't it?

960
01:45:24,658 --> 01:45:25,181
Answer me.

961
01:45:25,893 --> 01:45:28,157
Why did you keep the bomb?
where did you keep it?

962
01:45:28,395 --> 01:45:29,259
Who is it?

963
01:45:29,663 --> 01:45:30,630
That Ceylon fellow madam.

964
01:45:30,831 --> 01:45:33,493
God! inspite of hitting,
he is not answering.

965
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:34,667
But Prabhu will answer us.

966
01:45:35,102 --> 01:45:35,568
Answer me.

967
01:45:36,236 --> 01:45:38,636
Where did you place the bomb?
why did you do it?

968
01:45:39,173 --> 01:45:39,798
Who are you?

969
01:45:40,441 --> 01:45:42,807
Are you a Pakistani or a Khalistani?

970
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:45,307
Or are you a Palestinian?

971
01:45:45,846 --> 01:45:48,314
l'll give you a minute
rattle off everything.

972
01:45:48,682 --> 01:45:50,149
What is it?
- lts ice madam.

973
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:51,317
Did you give this to him?

974
01:45:51,518 --> 01:45:52,314
l shall if
you ask me to.

975
01:45:54,354 --> 01:45:56,822
This is not for eating
but to be shoved in.

976
01:45:58,692 --> 01:46:02,992
lf l insert it
it will be cold...you'll laugh.

977
01:46:03,864 --> 01:46:06,162
lt will freeze...you can't handle it.

978
01:46:06,467 --> 01:46:09,834
As you skin pulls
you'll experience a terrible pain.

979
01:46:10,137 --> 01:46:11,161
That will move from stomach
to chest,

980
01:46:11,371 --> 01:46:13,839
Shoulder to neck & will go
right upto your head.

981
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:15,675
Shall l try it?

982
01:46:18,712 --> 01:46:19,508
Are you feeling shy?

983
01:46:21,315 --> 01:46:25,684
Tell me, tell me...Prabhu.

984
01:46:25,886 --> 01:46:27,513
l didn't plant a bomb,
nor did anything else.

985
01:46:27,721 --> 01:46:30,019
l know the mistake you did,
l know everything.

986
01:46:30,557 --> 01:46:32,684
Assure me you won't do it
again, l'll spare you.

987
01:46:32,893 --> 01:46:33,689
l didn't commit any mistake.

988
01:46:34,061 --> 01:46:36,188
Hey, first come & shove the ice.

989
01:47:07,594 --> 01:47:09,721
What happened? Have you gone mad?

990
01:47:10,597 --> 01:47:11,393
Why have you come here?

991
01:47:12,099 --> 01:47:13,726
Why are you breaking the walls
like this, damn it.

992
01:47:14,101 --> 01:47:14,658
Come inside.

993
01:47:14,935 --> 01:47:16,402
l won't- Come inside.

994
01:47:17,271 --> 01:47:17,896
Leave my hand.

995
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,408
Sitting in dirty places like this,
why are you being so stubborn?

996
01:47:22,943 --> 01:47:24,570
Are you going to come or not?
- l won't.

997
01:47:25,112 --> 01:47:26,579
This, This will be my place.

998
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:30,409
As long as Prabhu in jail,
This will be my place.

999
01:47:32,386 --> 01:47:33,148
l'll stay here only.

1000
01:47:33,954 --> 01:47:35,683
Go. Go & inform you husband.

1001
01:47:42,796 --> 01:47:44,764
Prabhu, haven't you had food?

1002
01:47:46,967 --> 01:47:48,434
You should eat on time.

1003
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:50,596
Only then you'll be able to
bear the torture.

1004
01:47:51,471 --> 01:47:53,769
Eat, eat.

1005
01:47:55,142 --> 01:47:56,268
What have they given to eat?

1006
01:48:00,414 --> 01:48:03,611
Oh non-veg! you'll eat this isn't it?

1007
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:05,785
Eat.

1008
01:48:07,487 --> 01:48:11,446
Hey, Will you wag your tail any where just
because you have one.

1009
01:48:12,492 --> 01:48:14,756
See! Now they've asked me
to cut it completely.

1010
01:48:15,429 --> 01:48:17,954
Eat! eat.

1011
01:48:21,501 --> 01:48:22,763
l am asking you to eat it.

1012
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:35,808
lf you don't eat, you'll die.
Eat.

1013
01:48:37,684 --> 01:48:40,152
l've told you isn't it?
- l don't need it.

1014
01:48:41,188 --> 01:48:43,486
How can l have food when
Prabhu is starving there?

1015
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:46,485
You're going to be beaten to death.

1016
01:48:48,195 --> 01:48:50,163
Have little, just little.

1017
01:48:51,031 --> 01:48:54,159
Eat, eat dear eat.

1018
01:48:55,135 --> 01:48:56,500
l'll beat you to death.

1019
01:48:57,204 --> 01:48:58,330
Are you going to eat or not?

1020
01:48:59,873 --> 01:49:04,674
Hey Eat! Eat! Eat.

1021
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:12,514
God! Do you eat this also?

1022
01:49:13,553 --> 01:49:16,522
Just tell me''l love you''
l'll eat it even raw.

1023
01:49:21,895 --> 01:49:23,692
You want me to eat, is it?

1024
01:49:58,765 --> 01:50:00,062
What is it Prabhu?

1025
01:50:02,602 --> 01:50:05,400
Are the mosquitoes biting you?
Come to my room.

1026
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:09,407
Oh you are not wearing clothes, isn't it?

1027
01:50:10,110 --> 01:50:11,907
Hey! where is his dress?

1028
01:50:12,112 --> 01:50:12,908
l've given it for dry cleaning.

1029
01:50:13,213 --> 01:50:14,237
What!...Dry cleaning!...

1030
01:50:14,881 --> 01:50:17,247
Give him something to wrap
himself up & bring him to my room - Okay madam.

1031
01:50:44,644 --> 01:50:56,283
Raja is the ant biting you?
ls the ant biting you?

1032
01:51:05,332 --> 01:51:06,458
lf you can't bear the bite
remove it.

1033
01:51:08,001 --> 01:51:10,299
Otherwise say what l ask you to say.

1034
01:51:12,672 --> 01:51:15,140
lt's a mistake to have kept a bomb
in Kakarla's daughter's heart.

1035
01:51:15,842 --> 01:51:17,639
lt's a sin to have
disturbed her heart.

1036
01:51:18,345 --> 01:51:19,972
lt's mistake to have loved her.

1037
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:21,977
l won't repeat this again.

1038
01:51:22,516 --> 01:51:25,144
lf you say these words,
l'll free you, say.

1039
01:51:26,686 --> 01:51:30,315
Say! Say Prabhu.

1040
01:51:52,712 --> 01:52:00,175
Through the breeze l sent
a message through my tress.

1041
01:52:14,234 --> 01:52:22,039
Let it etch in your heart,
what happened yesterday.

1042
01:52:27,914 --> 01:52:34,877
Just like water foam, gets
caught in the whirlwind

1043
01:52:36,756 --> 01:52:43,889
When are we going to play
in another planet?

1044
01:53:17,464 --> 01:53:19,432
Hey Sruthi, come out.

1045
01:53:21,468 --> 01:53:22,594
Are you going to come out or not?

1046
01:54:12,185 --> 01:54:12,810
Welcome Mr.Kathiresan.

1047
01:54:13,787 --> 01:54:17,154
Guys fit for a factory
security job have joined the police force.

1048
01:54:17,524 --> 01:54:19,082
Nobody here knows how to bash him up.

1049
01:54:19,459 --> 01:54:21,984
Since you have experience
come & bash him up - Okay.

1050
01:54:22,195 --> 01:54:23,992
He is keeping his mouth shut
inspite of keeping a bomb.

1051
01:54:24,364 --> 01:54:25,160
Make him speak.

1052
01:54:38,878 --> 01:54:39,845
Where did you keep the bomb?

1053
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,845
Where did you keep the bomb? Speak.

1054
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:46,344
That's enough.

1055
01:54:50,957 --> 01:54:55,860
Okay, have you found
your missing son? - No.

1056
01:54:56,563 --> 01:54:57,689
Did you search for him?

1057
01:54:57,897 --> 01:54:59,194
Yes l've looked everywhere for him.

1058
01:54:59,733 --> 01:55:01,530
l think he must have done
something wrong.

1059
01:55:03,236 --> 01:55:03,861
Yes madam.

1060
01:55:04,571 --> 01:55:07,699
Why don't you advice
him that it is wrong?

1061
01:55:08,975 --> 01:55:09,964
lf l see him l'll advice him.

1062
01:55:12,579 --> 01:55:13,204
Tell him.

1063
01:55:25,859 --> 01:55:30,887
Son! Prabhu! Dear.

1064
01:55:31,931 --> 01:55:34,229
Did l hit my son?
Oh God!

1065
01:55:35,268 --> 01:55:36,394
Did l hit my son?

1066
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:39,068
l've hit my own son with this
hand, how could this happen?

1067
01:55:40,273 --> 01:55:43,572
We don't need this...,
we don't need this son.

1068
01:55:43,943 --> 01:55:46,571
We don't need anything,
particularly love.

1069
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:50,409
Forget it, forget it my son
for my sake forget it.

1070
01:55:50,950 --> 01:55:52,417
lt is you who taught me, daddy.

1071
01:55:52,786 --> 01:55:57,086
Yes, it was me who taught you
but now, you are important to me.

1072
01:55:57,290 --> 01:55:58,814
Sruthi is important to me.

1073
01:56:00,627 --> 01:56:04,586
They'll bash you to death
you can't sustain their torture.

1074
01:56:05,131 --> 01:56:07,429
You can't my son, you can't.

1075
01:56:08,968 --> 01:56:09,764
l can withstand it.

1076
01:56:10,904 --> 01:56:13,429
lt's you who taught me that love,

1077
01:56:14,474 --> 01:56:15,839
Will give the strength
to withstand anything.

1078
01:56:16,476 --> 01:56:18,273
Kathiresan you can go.

1079
01:56:23,483 --> 01:56:25,075
Hey! get him into the jeep.

1080
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,317
Greetings Mr.Sinha. How are things?

1081
01:57:02,522 --> 01:57:05,821
Greetings, greetings- l've been
wanting to talk to you.

1082
01:57:16,369 --> 01:57:18,667
Victory assured!-
Are you hermit Sachidananda?

1083

l am Kakarla's daughter, Sruthi.

1085
01:57:24,711 --> 01:57:25,507
Do you have some sacred ash?

1086
01:57:37,724 --> 01:57:39,021
Long live dear.

1087
01:57:39,392 --> 01:57:42,190
Lord Muruga is enjoying
on the hill.

1088
01:57:42,395 --> 01:57:46,024
Girls come there like bees.

1089
01:57:54,407 --> 01:57:55,203
Get lost you fool.

1090
01:58:12,926 --> 01:58:16,054
l did not have food
for the past 2 days, l'm hungry.

1091
01:58:28,041 --> 01:58:28,735
Take the camera away.

1092
01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:31,735
Come here.

1093
01:58:32,278 --> 01:58:34,746
Hey Sruthi, what is all this
lsn't your dad a big shot?

1094
01:58:35,715 --> 01:58:37,239
Don't disrespect him
by behaving this way.

1095
01:58:37,617 --> 01:58:38,914
Whatever it may be let us go in & discuss it.

1096
01:58:41,454 --> 01:58:42,079
Leave me.

1097
01:58:43,122 --> 01:58:46,250
Have you been in love?
Do you know what love is?

1098
01:58:49,295 --> 01:58:50,421
Have you atleast loved your husband?

1099
01:58:52,465 --> 01:58:53,932
Get lost...

1100
01:58:54,734 --> 01:58:56,599
Hey get lost.

1101
01:58:58,471 --> 01:58:59,438
Why have you stopped playing?

1102
01:58:59,806 --> 01:59:01,774
Buddy! do you know Pettai rap.

1103
01:59:08,648 --> 01:59:11,276
Whatever is fated, will come to you.

1104
01:59:11,651 --> 01:59:13,619
Be happy with what you get.

1105
01:59:13,987 --> 01:59:18,287
What ever happens is for the best
good times will come.

1106
01:59:23,329 --> 01:59:24,956
Sruthi!
- What daddy.

1107
01:59:31,004 --> 01:59:31,470
Get inside.

1108
01:59:32,772 --> 01:59:34,797
Release Prabhu, l'll go inside.

1109
01:59:36,843 --> 01:59:38,811
lf you don't go inside l'll whip you now.

1110
01:59:39,512 --> 01:59:40,809
lf you lay your hands on me.

1111
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:43,648
l'll remove all my clothes & stand nude.

1112
01:59:55,795 --> 01:59:58,662
What's happening Mr.Rao
Who is Prabhu?

1113
01:59:59,432 --> 02:00:02,162
There is a strike going for the release
of Prabhu. ls he the same guy?

1114
02:00:03,536 --> 02:00:07,836
Yes, he is the guy,
my lover.

1115
02:00:08,975 --> 02:00:11,500
Are you going to
listen to me or not? Go inside.

1116
02:00:11,811 --> 02:00:13,005
Release Prabhu.

1117
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:16,508
l'll do what you say, go
wherever you want me to.

1118
02:00:24,557 --> 02:00:25,854
Ask them to release that guy.

1119
02:01:28,955 --> 02:01:34,916
How can they guard lovers
answer me my love.

1120
02:01:36,963 --> 02:01:40,592
Why a big guard?
with a red flower.

1121
02:01:40,967 --> 02:01:43,060
lt will destroy all villains, dear moon.

1122
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:31,314
At Jurassic Park today, there is
a happy pair singing jazz.

1123
02:02:33,019 --> 02:02:39,322
Without separating, Picasso's
painting is dancing in Texan with me.

1124
02:02:41,027 --> 02:02:44,827
Cow boy's glance & play boy's hand.

1125
02:02:45,031 --> 02:02:48,831
Two different people became one.

1126
02:02:49,035 --> 02:02:52,835
Music became women, strawberry
became eyes.

1127
02:02:53,039 --> 02:02:56,839
All are celebrating love &
have become drowsy.

1128
02:02:57,210 --> 02:03:01,169
ls our love an unwritten poem?

1129
02:03:37,250 --> 02:03:43,211
Even if you hold a pistol & attack
will love break in front of a bullet?

1130
02:03:45,258 --> 02:03:51,390
lf you throw a fishing net, will
you be able to catch stars.

1131
02:03:53,032 --> 02:03:56,900
What if there is a earthquake or
if the earth gets burnt.

1132
02:03:57,103 --> 02:04:00,903
Will the sky ever break or become 2 parts?

1133
02:04:01,107 --> 02:04:04,838
Come my dear parrot,
jump like a Veena.

1134
02:04:05,044 --> 02:04:08,912
Lets chart the law of love
according to the time & our wish.

1135
02:04:09,282 --> 02:04:13,082
ls happiness always an unsaturated song.

1136
02:05:51,550 --> 02:05:52,346
Did they bash, you up badly?

1137
02:05:53,052 --> 02:05:53,848
How is Sruthi, daddy?

1138
02:05:55,054 --> 02:05:56,351
Did they give you
anything to eat dear?

1139
02:05:56,722 --> 02:05:58,087
Did you meet Sruthi daddy?

1140
02:05:59,392 --> 02:06:01,417
Oh God! let's go back home.

1141
02:06:01,727 --> 02:06:02,523
Are we going to Sruthi's
house?

1142
02:06:05,398 --> 02:06:07,696
You can't see that girl now
- Why daddy?

1143
02:06:09,735 --> 02:06:11,032
Only after sending Sruti to
her grandparents house,

1144
02:06:11,237 --> 02:06:12,204
They've released you.

1145
02:06:21,914 --> 02:06:24,781
Tadepalligudem, Andhra Pradesh.

1146
02:06:43,936 --> 02:06:45,062
lt's been 4 days.

1147
02:06:45,604 --> 02:06:49,233
Since she has eaten,spoken or smiled.

1148
02:06:49,942 --> 02:06:50,738
What do we do?

1149
02:06:51,544 --> 02:06:53,068
Shall we do one thing
- What is it?

1150
02:06:53,779 --> 02:06:54,746
Shall l hit with this stick...

1151
02:06:54,947 --> 02:06:56,244
Hit? you damn it.

1152
02:06:58,284 --> 02:06:59,808
How is it? Do it once again.

1153
02:07:02,455 --> 02:07:05,618
Wow! l've got an idea...come on...

1154
02:07:05,825 --> 02:07:15,097

1155

l'll see, how'll your
husband Rama comes here.

1157
02:07:22,308 --> 02:07:25,277
Even l'll love him, if he comes here.

1158
02:07:29,315 --> 02:07:31,442
Your idea is not working
you go to bed.

1159
02:07:31,650 --> 02:07:32,275
l'll look after that.

1160
02:07:32,485 --> 02:07:35,113

to sleep.

1161
02:07:35,321 --> 02:07:37,516
lf Ram comes, wake me...up...

1162
02:07:44,663 --> 02:07:45,527
Madam Sita....

1163
02:07:46,999 --> 02:07:49,467
Madam Sita, are you here?

1164
02:07:50,669 --> 02:07:53,866
Don't worry...your Rama
will definitely come.

1165

Here...your Rama gave you a ring...

1166
02:07:59,011 --> 02:08:02,071
Don't want?
-...Don't want?...

1167
02:08:04,683 --> 02:08:05,809
She's laughing...laughing...

1168
02:08:08,687 --> 02:08:13,488
Madam if you give any identification
to remember you...l'll give to Rama...

1169
02:08:21,367 --> 02:08:22,231
She's laughing...laughing...

1170
02:08:22,701 --> 02:08:30,164
Oh! Rama! we're coming.

1171
02:08:30,376 --> 02:08:34,005
l've given my heart to you...

1172
02:08:39,051 --> 02:08:40,018
Oh Dog!...dog....

1173
02:08:40,219 --> 02:08:42,517
Oh! it's gone...it's gone.

1174
02:08:42,721 --> 02:08:44,848
Grandpa, if you don't get that child's rattle.

1175
02:08:45,057 --> 02:08:46,684

Go...

1178
02:08:52,398 --> 02:08:53,194
Oh! rattle is gone...

Oh! dog...rattle is gone...

02:08:56,235 --> 02:09:00,262
l'll give you sweets...

1181
02:09:02,908 --> 02:09:05,138
Hey! Prabhu! dance school
has come.

1182
02:09:05,744 --> 02:09:07,803
l've enquired Sruthi address,
no one knows it.

1183
02:09:08,247 --> 02:09:11,114
They don't understand our language...
we're unable to understand theirs.

1184
02:09:12,751 --> 02:09:15,549
Peddapuram is famous
for ''molls'' it's near only...

1185
02:09:16,088 --> 02:09:20,286
lf we stay there & enjoy the whole night...

1186
02:09:20,593 --> 02:09:21,890
We'll search it leisurely in the morning
what do you say?

1187
02:09:22,094 --> 02:09:24,562
Hey! Vasanth, look there.

02:09:25,431 --> 02:09:26,830
Please, stop the boat...

1189

Go...Go slowly...

1190
02:09:31,103 --> 02:09:33,230
Hey! don't push me down...

1191
02:09:35,441 --> 02:09:37,636
Madam, whose dress is this?
- Men's clothes...

1192
02:09:39,445 --> 02:09:40,434
Starting itself is not good...

1193
02:09:43,949 --> 02:09:47,180
Amulu, whose dress is this?

1194
02:09:48,454 --> 02:09:49,250
Are you a stranger?

1195
02:09:50,122 --> 02:09:50,747
l got caught...

1196
02:09:50,956 --> 02:09:53,186
What's this? she has called you for a dance
and is calling me for a fight.

1197
02:09:53,392 --> 02:09:54,916
When will this confrontation end
between us?

1198
02:09:55,127 --> 02:09:55,786
You yourself ask her...

1199
02:09:56,795 --> 02:09:59,093
Madam, in this town who's
has a phone?

1200
02:09:59,298 --> 02:10:00,595
Food? - Yes...Phone?...

1201
02:10:00,799 --> 02:10:02,460
Poor men! haven't you
had food?

1202
02:10:02,801 --> 02:10:03,927
ls she having phone in the
wash area itself?

1203
02:10:04,136 --> 02:10:04,659
Have food!

1204
02:10:06,305 --> 02:10:07,863
What's this? if l ask for phone

1205
02:10:08,807 --> 02:10:09,933
lt's alright...l'll eat & come...
you carry on.

1206
02:10:14,980 --> 02:10:16,777
l told you to ask about Sruthi
but you've brought this...

1207
02:10:16,982 --> 02:10:19,542
This love problem won't
get solved.

1208
02:10:19,818 --> 02:10:21,115
Anyhow, after clothes
have become dry...

1209
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:23,015
Surely with them she'll
go to Sruthi's house.

1210
02:10:23,322 --> 02:10:25,449
So, we've to wait, till
clothes get dry...

1211
02:10:47,346 --> 02:10:48,813
Here...Child's rattle...

1212
02:10:55,187 --> 02:10:57,985
Rama...
- Our Sita's Rama?

1213
02:11:00,192 --> 02:11:02,387
Son, are you Rama?

1214
02:11:05,364 --> 02:11:06,592
Are you Prabhu?

1215
02:11:07,866 --> 02:11:09,993
You've come here in
search of Sruthi, isn't it?

1216
02:11:15,541 --> 02:11:20,171
Son we're very happy...l'm, Sruthi's
grandpa and she's her grandma - Yes!

1217
02:11:20,546 --> 02:11:23,344
Prabhu, are they Kakarla's
parents?

1218
02:11:24,216 --> 02:11:26,013
lt seems they look like
a mad family...

1219
02:11:26,385 --> 02:11:29,286
Brother, we can understand
what you're saying.

1220
02:11:31,056 --> 02:11:34,082
Prabhu, Sruthi loves you very much...

1221
02:11:34,393 --> 02:11:36,759
She's crying to see you.

1222
02:11:36,962 --> 02:11:39,362
We brought this costume
just to make her laugh...

1223
02:11:39,565 --> 02:11:43,092
Excellent, are they both
on Sruthi's side?

1224
02:11:43,569 --> 02:11:45,298
Then, let us all have
great fun...

1225
02:11:45,571 --> 02:11:47,368
Grandma, have you got a vehicle?
Let's go home.

1226
02:11:47,573 --> 02:11:49,370
Dear, that is not so easy....

1227
02:11:49,908 --> 02:11:51,773
100 henchman were on security.

1228
02:11:52,077 --> 02:11:54,875
lf they recognise you, they'll
kill you...

1229
02:11:55,247 --> 02:11:56,373
This is Kakarla's order...

1230
02:11:56,582 --> 02:11:57,378
Let the order go to hell.

1231
02:11:57,916 --> 02:12:00,214
They should come to our house...
This is my order...

1232
02:12:00,419 --> 02:12:03,877
Wait....l'm thinking, how
to take them home?

1233
02:12:04,089 --> 02:12:05,056
You're talking something else...

1234
02:12:05,257 --> 02:12:06,315
Wait....Wait...

1235
02:12:30,115 --> 02:12:31,412

1237
02:12:38,457 --> 02:12:39,822
Sruthi has come from

Hey, bring all the boxes inside.

02:13:50,529 --> 02:13:54,226
Did my heart reach out first, or my eyes?

1252
02:13:54,533 --> 02:13:57,900
Or did my hands reach out first.

1253
02:13:58,704 --> 02:14:06,167
ls it the moon or the wave
or the sun which reached out first?

1254
02:14:06,712 --> 02:14:14,346
lt is a celebration of youth
and love.

1255
02:14:30,736 --> 02:14:33,534
Whether it's sorrow or happiness...
or anger or tears...

1256
02:14:33,906 --> 02:14:36,272
Whatever it is... leave them aside
for 5 minutes.

1257
02:15:34,466 --> 02:15:38,596
Move away...Move away

1264
02:16:37,696 --> 02:16:41,598
Hey! now, l'm looking like
a pregnant woman...

1265
02:16:42,034 --> 02:16:42,659

1267
02:16:47,873 --> 02:16:49,738

02:17:14,066 --> 02:17:19,868
Oh! Gopala! your sharp eyes

1270
02:17:29,581 --> 02:17:31,549
Oh! Gopala who've come

the basket...

1272
02:17:34,419 --> 02:17:36,387
Gopala who've come in search

02:17:36,588 --> 02:17:39,216
l've locked it inside...

1274
02:17:41,927 --> 02:17:48,628
Oh Gopala...Go away..

1275
02:17:49,668 --> 02:17:53,900
Bat is not eating fruits even after
finding them. Like that go away Gopala.

1276
02:18:31,476 --> 02:18:35,503
l came across 7
mountains to see this flower.

1277
02:18:36,314 --> 02:18:40,614
Fought against the Cupid &
reduced the intake of Aphrodite.

Why do l need this green leaves?

1282
02:19:01,173 --> 02:19:04,870
Watch out afterwards there'll
be many things to break.

1283
02:19:05,677 --> 02:19:10,876
Oh maiden your body is golden
overflowing with blood.

1284
02:19:11,082 --> 02:19:15,644
lt'll make your heart
recite new poems.

1285
02:19:35,707 --> 02:19:40,337
Bat won't eat fruits even after finding them.
Like that go away Gopala.

1286
02:20:30,428 --> 02:20:34,387
lf you kiss on my forehead
butterflies flutter in my heart.

1287
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:39,298
lf you kiss on my ears
dear, eyes will flicker.

1288
02:20:40,105 --> 02:20:45,099
Oh buddy! l've lost my
shyness & fear...

1289
02:20:50,115 --> 02:20:54,916
Oh God! sweets become tasteless
because of you...

1290
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:58,749
Oh lover! somewhere fire
is burning in the train.

1291
02:20:59,958 --> 02:21:01,425
lf something goes wrong-...

1292
02:21:01,793 --> 02:21:04,193
We both are responsible
for it...

1293
02:21:04,629 --> 02:21:09,589
Wow! Now, my heart has
forgotten the world.

1294
02:21:09,801 --> 02:21:14,670
Oh Maiden! This will overflow
and reach your soul.

1295
02:22:02,854 --> 02:22:05,049
All of you go carefully...

1296
02:22:05,256 --> 02:22:07,053
Why? Are you not coming
to the fort?

1297
02:22:08,526 --> 02:22:11,188
l've to go to'Peddapuram' - Why.

1298
02:22:12,697 --> 02:22:14,062

- Why are you going?

1299
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:18,260
Don't want...lock
the door....lock it...

1300
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:39,451
This temple, mountain, cave & fort.

1301
02:22:39,658 --> 02:22:40,852
They are all our ancestors'
properties...

1302
02:22:41,059 --> 02:22:43,152
After British came to rule.

1303
02:22:43,595 --> 02:22:45,756
Government took over everything.

1304
02:22:46,197 --> 02:22:49,997
My marriage & Sruthi's
father's marriage.

1305
02:22:50,201 --> 02:22:51,463
Was performed only at
this place.

1306
02:22:51,670 --> 02:22:53,365
You both should get married.

1307
02:22:53,571 --> 02:22:55,163
And you both should live happily...

1308
02:22:55,373 --> 02:22:56,362
That's why, l've brought you here.

1309
02:22:56,574 --> 02:22:57,097
Yes...

1310
02:22:59,611 --> 02:23:00,976
This is not an ordinary lion.

1311
02:23:01,179 --> 02:23:03,739
lf someone lie by keeping their
hands on its mouth, lt'll bits...

1312
02:23:04,215 --> 02:23:08,242
Tell this story to some fool...

1313
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:11,185
Prabhu, what Sruthi
said was right.

1314
02:23:11,389 --> 02:23:15,086
Those days, kings will find the
liars through this lion only.

1315
02:23:15,293 --> 02:23:17,693
lf this lion bites, they'll
undergo punishment.

1316
02:23:17,896 --> 02:23:20,296
Let's see...Keept it & see.

1317
02:23:23,868 --> 02:23:25,130
l'm not loving Sruthi.

1318
02:23:26,504 --> 02:23:27,596
l swear, l'm not loving her...

1319
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:30,571
Will anyone love her?

1320
02:23:31,810 --> 02:23:34,142
She looks beautiful & has
good figure...

1321
02:23:34,345 --> 02:23:36,245
l thought of enjoying her
just like that.

1322
02:23:36,448 --> 02:23:38,006
That's why l came to
'Thadi' school...

1323
02:23:43,755 --> 02:23:46,553
No...No...l'm loving Sruthi...

1324
02:23:46,758 --> 02:23:47,747
l swear, l love her...

1325
02:23:47,959 --> 02:23:49,426
lt was a lies...it's all a lie...

1326
02:24:04,843 --> 02:24:06,367
Oh! that's the matter...

1327
02:24:07,212 --> 02:24:09,942
Hubby, did you close its mouth
by pulling its tail?

1328
02:24:10,148 --> 02:24:10,614
Yes...

1329
02:24:12,484 --> 02:24:15,544
Oh my God, both of them got scared.

1330
02:24:16,054 --> 02:24:21,651
Both of them were
born & brought up somewhere.

1331
02:24:21,893 --> 02:24:26,125
Till now, if they both
love truly means.

1332
02:24:26,364 --> 02:24:29,356
Faith is the only reason
for that.

1333
02:24:29,567 --> 02:24:33,560
l did like this.

1334
02:24:33,772 --> 02:24:36,172
How intelligent you are...

1335
02:24:40,011 --> 02:24:41,569
Hey! what happened?

1336
02:24:42,347 --> 02:24:44,611
Prabhu, again don't say like this
for fun also...

1337
02:24:45,517 --> 02:24:47,246
My heart can't
bear it.

1338
02:24:47,819 --> 02:24:49,912
You know very well that what
all l said was a lie.

1339
02:24:50,555 --> 02:24:51,954
Prabhu, l'm afraid...

1340
02:24:53,591 --> 02:24:54,990
Will we get married?

1341
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:56,452
Definitely...

1342
02:24:56,661 --> 02:24:57,628
Prabhu, how's it possible?

1343
02:24:57,996 --> 02:24:58,985
Are we going to run away
somewhere.

1344
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:01,694
No, Sruthi...we haven't done
any mistake.

1345
02:25:01,933 --> 02:25:03,332
Why should we hide & live?

1346
02:25:04,669 --> 02:25:05,533
l'm going to talk to
your father.

1347
02:25:06,337 --> 02:25:08,396
l'm going to ask him
''Marry your daughter to me''...

1348
02:25:08,573 --> 02:25:09,972
Have you gone mad?

1349
02:25:11,009 --> 02:25:12,943
Anyhow, your father is going
to get you married somewhere.

1350
02:25:13,278 --> 02:25:14,905
Why can't l be that one.
l'm going to ask him.

1351
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:18,542
Should your would be
a qualified M.B.A or engineer?

1352
02:25:18,750 --> 02:25:19,546
l'll study...

1353
02:25:19,751 --> 02:25:20,877
lf he wants a millionaire

1354
02:25:21,419 --> 02:25:22,477
l'll earn & show him...

1355
02:25:22,687 --> 02:25:23,585
Prabhu, is it possible?

1356
02:25:24,455 --> 02:25:25,683
Till you're with me...

1357
02:25:27,559 --> 02:25:28,685
l can achieve anything.

1358
02:25:55,086 --> 02:25:56,986
Mali, when did you come?...
come inside.

1359
02:26:22,714 --> 02:26:24,011
Who is he?

1360
02:26:24,215 --> 02:26:28,447
Film distributor! he has come
to show a film.

1361
02:26:29,654 --> 02:26:31,019
ls he showing a film?

1362
02:26:45,937 --> 02:26:47,529
He has lost....

1363
02:26:47,739 --> 02:26:50,367
Shut up. Stay outside for 10 minutes
l'll score 10,000...

1364
02:27:21,639 --> 02:27:22,628
Who's it?

1365
02:27:23,574 --> 02:27:24,506
How's your leg?

1366
02:27:24,709 --> 02:27:25,334
lt's okay...

1367
02:27:25,543 --> 02:27:26,510
ls everything ready?

1368
02:27:27,378 --> 02:27:29,471
This time, like Chidambaram
it shouldn't fail.

1369
02:27:29,681 --> 02:27:31,239
l'm not responsible for
that failure...

1370
02:27:31,449 --> 02:27:32,438
Your daughter...

1371
02:27:33,451 --> 02:27:34,679
Don't talk about it now...

1372
02:27:34,886 --> 02:27:38,014
l'll talk...l called you now
to talk about that only...

1373
02:27:38,823 --> 02:27:41,485
You think that your
daughter is safe here.

1374
02:27:41,726 --> 02:27:42,556
That is wrong...

1375
02:27:43,061 --> 02:27:44,585
Now, that guy is here...

1376
02:27:45,596 --> 02:27:47,962
He's spending the whole day
with your daughter.

1377
02:27:48,166 --> 02:27:51,192
Kill him...why have you
still left him? kill him.

1378
02:27:52,337 --> 02:27:54,305
lf l kill him by myself, it'll be
free of cost.

1379
02:27:54,672 --> 02:27:56,902
lf l kill him by your order
l'll be paid.

1380
02:27:57,375 --> 02:27:58,433
l'll...

1381
02:29:04,642 --> 02:29:07,770
As you said, l've placed the
bomb inside that only.

1382
02:29:11,282 --> 02:29:13,512
lt's a 1000 yrs stone building..

1383
02:29:14,185 --> 02:29:17,279
lt's not a cement building
be careful...

1384
02:29:20,058 --> 02:29:20,922
When will it blast?

1385
02:29:29,834 --> 02:29:31,699
This is General hospital
main building...

1386
02:29:34,405 --> 02:29:37,067
On the ground floor, there's
an Ortho section

1387
02:29:57,895 --> 02:29:59,055
Where is he?

1388
02:29:59,597 --> 02:30:00,188
Who?

1389
02:30:02,333 --> 02:30:03,095
That bearded man...

1390
02:32:11,662 --> 02:32:13,391
Hey take the suitcase & go to Madras.

1391
02:33:10,855 --> 02:33:13,085
You fool...You fool.

1392
02:33:13,424 --> 02:33:15,756
You're telling so casually
that they've taken it.

1393
02:33:16,193 --> 02:33:18,388
Did l appoint you to
drive donkeys?

1394
02:33:18,596 --> 02:33:19,927
You've 100 henchmen also.

1395
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:21,729
You've lost it & you're standing here...?

1396
02:33:22,166 --> 02:33:24,828
lf someone gets it, don't
you know what will happen?

1397
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:32,807
lt's nothing to me...you're
going to be trapped....

1398
02:33:33,744 --> 02:33:36,770
These type of persons should
be hanged to death.

1399
02:33:37,548 --> 02:33:39,539
l'll say it casually
in the interview...

1400
02:33:40,618 --> 02:33:43,985
At last, l'll put an end
to you also...

1401
02:33:45,156 --> 02:33:47,021
You're the one who fixes the
last date for the entire town.

1402
02:33:47,224 --> 02:33:49,021
Don't l know that you'll fix
a date for me also?

1403
02:33:49,226 --> 02:33:53,060
That's why l've kept the recorded tape
of our conversation.

1404
02:33:56,400 --> 02:33:58,231
That also, he has taken...

1405
02:33:58,703 --> 02:34:02,161
Now, he's going to fix the last date
for both of us.

1406
02:34:02,907 --> 02:34:04,807
Not even in the Ganges...
ln the sewage water.

1407
02:34:05,242 --> 02:34:07,540
What's this? why are you giving me
these shock news in tandem?

1408
02:34:07,745 --> 02:34:08,939
That is my profession.

1409
02:34:14,652 --> 02:34:17,143
You're really intelligent.

1410
02:34:18,022 --> 02:34:20,081
You're also intelligent...
l'm also intelligent...

1411
02:34:20,358 --> 02:34:23,259
One shouldn't fool
both the intelligent men...

1412
02:34:23,461 --> 02:34:25,088
Tell me, what can we do?

1413
02:34:26,097 --> 02:34:28,895
l tried my level best
but he escaped.

1414
02:34:29,567 --> 02:34:32,297
Hereafter, use your brain,
use the Govt. power.

1415
02:34:33,204 --> 02:34:34,228
The one who has jumped into the river...

1416
02:34:34,438 --> 02:34:35,735
He couldn't have reached
Madras by this time...

1417
02:34:36,574 --> 02:34:40,101
Ask them to block all the
routes from Andhra to Madras.

1418
02:34:40,378 --> 02:34:43,973
Before he enters the city
we should catch him...

1419
02:34:44,181 --> 02:34:45,876
Take it...Rice ball...

1420
02:34:59,263 --> 02:35:00,252
Constable, open the door...

1421
02:35:42,039 --> 02:35:43,131
He's Vasanth, Prabhu's friend.

1422
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:44,637
We caught him on the road side.

1423
02:35:44,842 --> 02:35:46,935
As you said, he's having
camera & cassette.

1424
02:36:00,057 --> 02:36:03,925
ls it this cassette?
- Yes.

1425
02:36:04,829 --> 02:36:07,127
Lock them in that room...
Go...

1426
02:36:08,999 --> 02:36:11,194
Their story is over...
let us concentrate on ours.

1427
02:36:11,735 --> 02:36:12,667
When are you going to place it?

1428
02:36:12,870 --> 02:36:13,734
Today...- Where?

1429
02:36:15,139 --> 02:36:17,801
You fool...Today, l've
a programme there.

1430
02:36:18,008 --> 02:36:18,474
l know...

1431
02:36:19,043 --> 02:36:23,480
You're going there to meet
sick Vice President at 1 1 .30.

1432
02:36:24,248 --> 02:36:27,684
After your visit, exactly at 12.00
bomb will explode.

1433
02:36:27,885 --> 02:36:28,874
Only then, they won't suspect you...

1434
02:36:30,321 --> 02:36:31,720
You contact me, after the job
gets over.

1435
02:36:31,989 --> 02:36:34,116
Don't talk on telephone
or wireless...

1436
02:36:34,492 --> 02:36:35,754
They may over hear...

1437
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:38,760
Talk through this scrabbler.

1438
02:36:40,498 --> 02:36:42,932
Except us, no one can hear it...

1439
02:36:44,301 --> 02:36:47,168
The place where bomb is going
to explode, lock their men also there.

1440
02:36:48,138 --> 02:36:51,733
Let both the fools die
among the people.

1441
02:36:59,783 --> 02:37:00,511
Give it...

1442
02:37:01,385 --> 02:37:02,511
Where's the match box give me...

1443
02:37:05,589 --> 02:37:06,283
Show your hand.

1444
02:37:54,104 --> 02:37:55,071
Come quickly...

1445
02:37:59,977 --> 02:38:02,070
Prabhu, what place is this?

1446
02:38:03,113 --> 02:38:05,081
He has stopped the vehicle here...

1447
02:38:05,282 --> 02:38:07,773
lt looks like some hospital.
Which hospital...?

1448
02:38:10,354 --> 02:38:12,379
This is General hospital.

1449
02:38:15,726 --> 02:38:16,522
l'm Mali speaking...

1450
02:38:17,294 --> 02:38:18,124
Have you kept it?

1451
02:38:19,029 --> 02:38:19,688
Yes...

1452
02:38:19,997 --> 02:38:20,725
At what time?

1453
02:38:21,465 --> 02:38:22,329
At 12.00

1454
02:38:22,933 --> 02:38:24,059
Will it definitely blast?

1455
02:38:24,301 --> 02:38:25,768
This Mali is an expert.

1456
02:38:26,136 --> 02:38:28,696
But, you acted too smart
with me also, isn't it?

1457
02:38:28,906 --> 02:38:29,736
What do you mean?

1458
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:33,671
Nothing, you pray & welcome your death.

1459
02:38:40,517 --> 02:38:43,008
Look, Vice-President is inside.
Governor is going to come..

1460
02:38:43,153 --> 02:38:45,553
We can't allow anyone inside.
Listen to me...Go.

1461
02:38:45,856 --> 02:38:46,322
Get lost.

1462
02:38:46,991 --> 02:38:48,720
Hey! lt's very urgent...

1463
02:38:51,261 --> 02:38:52,125
Hey, Who are you?

1464
02:38:53,998 --> 02:38:54,965
Father! -
Where were you all these days?

1465
02:38:55,165 --> 02:38:56,359
l'll tell you later...
Come on, father.

1466
02:38:57,234 --> 02:38:58,531
Hey! Wait...What's so urgent?

1467
02:38:58,736 --> 02:39:00,897
Father, they've kept a bomb somewhere
here in the G.H.

1468
02:39:01,271 --> 02:39:03,000
They've kept the bomb?...
What're you saying?

1469
02:39:03,207 --> 02:39:04,401
There's no time to explain to you
all these things...

1470
02:39:04,608 --> 02:39:06,303
Call your Policemen...
We'll search inside.

1471
02:39:06,510 --> 02:39:07,477
Hey!....Hey!

1472
02:39:08,112 --> 02:39:09,704
4000 Patients...100 wards...

1473
02:39:09,913 --> 02:39:11,471
You both of them & 10 constables...

1474
02:39:11,682 --> 02:39:12,706
What can we do?

1475
02:39:12,916 --> 02:39:14,975
Vasanth, immediately go to
nearby Medical College.

1476
02:39:15,185 --> 02:39:16,152
And talk to the Chairman.

1477
02:39:16,353 --> 02:39:17,377
Bring all the students...

1478
02:39:17,588 --> 02:39:18,885
Ring up to other colleges also....

1479
02:39:19,089 --> 02:39:20,056
Bring all the students here...

1480
02:39:20,290 --> 02:39:21,257
Bomb may blast at any time.

1481
02:39:21,458 --> 02:39:23,426
Before that, we've to clear
all the patients from here.

1482
02:40:04,034 --> 02:40:08,971
Kakarla, you betrayer...

1483
02:40:14,411 --> 02:40:16,709
lt won't blast after you leave...

1484
02:40:18,082 --> 02:40:19,709
l'll blast it in
your presence...

1485
02:40:21,418 --> 02:40:23,978
You say your last prayers at 1 1 .30...

1486
02:40:28,859 --> 02:40:29,985
l'm P.A. to Vice-President speaking.

1487
02:40:31,028 --> 02:40:33,963
Doctor is coming to checkup
Vice-President at 1 1 .30.

1488
02:40:34,631 --> 02:40:36,963
Can you postpone your visit to 12.00?

1489
02:40:37,167 --> 02:40:39,226
At 12.00? No...it's impossible.

1490
02:40:43,140 --> 02:40:44,630
lt's very difficult....l can't.

1491
02:40:46,243 --> 02:40:47,210
lf you want, l'll come earlier.

1492
02:40:47,411 --> 02:40:47,877
When?

1493
02:40:48,579 --> 02:40:49,045
At 1 1 .00 AM

1494
02:41:10,567 --> 02:41:12,034
Have you come at 1 1 .00 itself?

1495
02:41:13,103 --> 02:41:14,900
Kakarla, l'll not leave you.

1496
02:41:16,373 --> 02:41:17,965
l'll see, how you're going to escape?

1497
02:42:06,223 --> 02:42:07,190
What did Doctor say?

1498
02:42:08,058 --> 02:42:09,491
He's telling something.

1499
02:42:51,401 --> 02:42:52,197
What's the noise here?

1500
02:42:54,171 --> 02:42:54,796
Why're they running like this?

1501
02:42:58,208 --> 02:42:59,334
What are you all doing here?

1502
02:42:59,543 --> 02:43:00,703
We think it as anonymous call.

1503
02:43:01,478 --> 02:43:02,604
Take him down immediately.

1504
02:44:28,932 --> 02:44:33,426
Someone help us...

1505
02:45:00,430 --> 02:45:02,660
Constable do something
& open this lift.

1506
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,160
Quick...do something.

1507
02:45:21,351 --> 02:45:22,909
Help us...Break this lift.

1508
02:45:36,533 --> 02:45:37,591
Rogue, it's all because of you...

1509
02:45:42,172 --> 02:45:44,732
Do something....Don't simply watch.

1510
02:45:46,309 --> 02:45:47,276
Prabhu, what're you doing here?

1511
02:45:47,477 --> 02:45:49,104
Father, Sruthi...
-l'll see to them.

1512
02:45:49,312 --> 02:45:50,040
You go & search the bomb.

1513
02:46:19,042 --> 02:46:19,940
Down...down..

1514
02:46:48,972 --> 02:46:50,030
Only 2 minutes more...

1515
02:46:56,546 --> 02:46:59,606
Hey, quick, Bomb may blast.

1516
02:47:14,131 --> 02:47:15,189
Hey, quick...Be quick.

1517
02:48:25,502 --> 02:48:26,469
Gayathri, you go first...

1518
02:49:13,483 --> 02:49:15,107
Earth & Sky may change...
