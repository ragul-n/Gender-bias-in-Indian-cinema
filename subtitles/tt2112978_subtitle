1
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:54,738
"Oh mama, I've been
a naughty boy tonight."

2
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,007
"Oh mama, I've been
a naughty boy tonight."

3
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:01,779
"Oh mama, I've been
a naughty boy tonight."

4
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:05,551
"Oh mama, I've been
a naughty boy tonight."

5
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:09,287
"Oh mama, I've been
a naughty boy tonight."

6
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,762
"I've been a naughty boy tonight."

7
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,661
"Shake it, baby."

8
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,958
"Groove with me."

9
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:21,967
"Shake it, baby."

10
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:25,604
"Groove with me."

11
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,740
Go away!

12
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:40,790
Abhay. How many
times have I told you...

13
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:44,022
...not to bother me when
there's a sock on the door

14
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,329
Hey, I am not the hater this time

15
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:47,722
Your Dad is...

16
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,999
Hey, Dad

17
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:00,771
I though you were
only flying in tomorrow?

18
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,677
Yeah. But I thought I'd surprise...

19
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:05,380
...and take you out for
a celebratory dinner...

20
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,883
...before your convocation

21
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:10,615
Rohan! Come out where ever you are!

22
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:13,020
Come on.
- One second. Wait!

23
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,724
Girlfriend number 31?

24
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,824
She's just a friend, Dad

25
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:22,356
When are you going to get
yourself a real girlfriend, Rohan?

26
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,795
Someone you actually care about?

27
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:26,462
Dad, I can handle my
love life on my own

28
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:27,762
Thanks

29
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:32,308
Oh, I forgot. You're a big boy now

30
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,337
You can make your own decisions

31
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:37,804
My advice doesn't
matter anymore, right?

32
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,677
Dad, I should get going

33
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:42,349
My friends are kind of waiting

34
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:45,545
So, that's a no for dinner

35
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,949
Dad, we've been
planning this party for months

36
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,356
I just can't...

37
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:50,986
I get it, Rohan

38
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:53,496
Next I should make an
appointment to come see you

39
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:55,591
Enjoy your party

40
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,558
"Today's a party. Tomorrow's a party"

41
00:03:22,627 --> 00:03:24,458
"The entire world's a big party"

42
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,865
"Use your body. Loose your body"

43
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,799
"In my arms just fuse your body"

44
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:37,338
"Today's party. Tomorrow's party"

45
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:39,342
"The entire world's a big party"

46
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,644
"Use your body. Loose your body"

47
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:46,706
"In my arms just fuse your body"

48
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:53,515
"Everyone's elated"

49
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:57,049
"There's no need to be sober"

50
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:00,727
"Everything's just a blur"

51
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:04,928
"Everyone's having fun"

52
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,275
"Today's party. Tomorrow's party"

53
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:16,006
"The entire world's a big party"

54
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,581
"Use your body. Loose your body"

55
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,517
"In my arms just fuse your body"

56
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,382
Sha na na na na na na na

57
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,984
That's how we groove groove

58
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:32,887
Sha na na na na na na na

59
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:34,693
That's how we move move

60
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,665
Sha na na na na na na na

61
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,463
That's how we groove groove

62
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:40,401
Sha na na na na na na na

63
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,665
That's how we move move

64
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,334
"Hey DJ, your beat
makes us dance up a storm"

65
00:04:45,476 --> 00:04:48,877
"Turn up the music
and let the music blow"

66
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:52,779
"Hey DJ, your beat
makes us dance up a storm."

67
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,013
"Turn up the music
and let the music blow"

68
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:59,682
"So don't give a damn,
let the volume grow"

69
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,853
"With your high volt break
all the glasses in a row"

70
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:05,785
"Today's party. Tomorrow's party"

71
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:07,728
"The entire world's a big party"

72
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:13,369
"Use your body. Loose your body"

73
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,462
"In my arms just fuse your body"

74
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:36,916
"Check out that sexy back
that sways away in style"

75
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:40,593
"But I don't have her
number in my mobile"

76
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:44,462
"Check out that sexy back
that sways away in style"

77
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:47,799
"But I don't have her
number in my mobile"

78
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:51,501
"O look the moon, moon,
moon is so placed so high"

79
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:55,739
"But when we move, move,
move we set it on fire"

80
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,644
"Today's party. Tomorrow's party"

81
00:05:57,715 --> 00:05:59,546
"The entire world's a big party"

82
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:04,881
"Use your body. Loose your body"

83
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:06,855
"In my arms just fuse your body"

84
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:13,694
"Everyone's elated"

85
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:17,598
"There's no need to be sober"

86
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:21,262
"Everything's just a blur"

87
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:25,434
"Everyone's having fun"

88
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,548
"Today's party. Tomorrow's party"

89
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:36,609
"The entire world's a big party"

90
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,924
"Use your body. Loose your body"

91
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:43,892
"In my arms just fuse your body"

92
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:49,963
Ladies and Gentlemen

93
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:56,367
I present to you the MBA
graduation class of 2011!

94
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:11,420
There he is

95
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:13,548
Mr. MBA, Rohan Bhatia

96
00:07:14,692 --> 00:07:15,989
Congratulations, son

97
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,828
Wish your Mom was here today

98
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:20,661
She'd be so proud

99
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:23,895
Come let's celebrate like old times

100
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:25,731
Let's go for lunch and
spend the rest of the day...

101
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:26,895
...doing whatever you want

102
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:30,868
Dad, I had told you I am leaving today

103
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:32,434
My flight's in an hour

104
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,909
I start work first
thing Monday morning

105
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:36,412
You could have just attended
the armed forces seminar...

106
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,381
...once before
making your final decision

107
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,381
Dad, we've been through this already

108
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,746
I want to make money.
I want to be a millionaire...

109
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,755
...and I can't do that
by serving in the forces

110
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,948
But I can only achieve that
after becoming a stock-broker

111
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:50,326
Money isn't everything, Rohan

112
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:52,960
You should choose
a career you love because...

113
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:55,024
...that's what will drive
you to success and happiness

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,436
I loved my country and serving it...

115
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,733
...as an officer truly made me happy

116
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,331
And in the pursuit of your happiness,
we lost Mom...

117
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:07,741
...because we didn't have
enough money for her treatment

118
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,408
If we did, we could have
got her treated abroad

119
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:19,819
Rohan, hurry... We'll miss the flight

120
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:23,985
Dad, I know what I want from life...

121
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:26,457
...and I'm going to get it

122
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:29,260
Thanks for coming

123
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,530
Will call you in few days

124
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:41,537
Fine, call me.
- Don't worry.

125
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:43,471
See you.
- See you, man.

126
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,790
Lets thank our lucky
stars that we made it

127
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:57,351
If we had missed this flight...

128
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:58,622
...there's no way we could
have made it to work on Monday

129
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,864
Kindly take your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

130
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,832
Luck has nothing to do with it, Abhay

131
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:07,531
Going to the top is my
destiny and nothing can stop that

132
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:11,567
Save your two rupee
lines for your girls, Rohan

133
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:12,836
They won't work on me

134
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:19,282
Thank you, brother.
- Mention not

135
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:20,945
Oh my, gosh

136
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:24,587
Thank you so much
- No worries

137
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,447
Everything is fine
when you're up to mischief

138
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,553
"But it's a beautiful life."

139
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,522
"I want to fly higher in the sky."

140
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,357
"But it's a beautiful life."

141
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:37,357
"I want to fly higher in the sky."

142
00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:39,335
"Walking on the road. Moving around."

143
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,835
"Walking on the road. Moving around."

144
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,003
"Watch-out."

145
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,902
"I have been taking the road."

146
00:09:57,922 --> 00:10:00,789
See, Abhay... Mumbai is
the girl paradise of India

147
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,951
There's no way we could've
slept in on our first night here

148
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:06,561
Ya... wow

149
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:09,330
Nice

150
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:13,293
Now watch the master in action.

151
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:16,032
I'll have them dancing
to my tunes in a heartbeat

152
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:17,397
We'll see.

153
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:23,739
"Hey you, I've been
looking all around."

154
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:27,575
"Hey you, I've been
looking all around."

155
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:35,321
"Hey you, I've been
looking all around."

156
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:38,862
"Hey you, I've been
looking all around for you."

157
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:42,855
"Hey you." "I see you there."

158
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,333
Oh my, gosh! I am terribly sorry

159
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,564
Trust me, this works every time

160
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,867
If you catch the stain right away...

161
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,373
Stop, you're just making things worse

162
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:52,600
Whatever little
attention I was getting...

163
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:53,735
...from the girls tonight will now...

164
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,071
This is Mumbai

165
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,712
And the kind of girls you've
been hitting on all night...

166
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:01,307
...aren't just going to be
impressed by your good looks

167
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:03,318
These girls need to
know how much money...

168
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:04,719
...you have in your bank account...

169
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:06,517
...even before they say hello

170
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,885
So you're impressed by my looks?

171
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,987
I think you've got me wrong

172
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,759
I am not that kind of girl

173
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,362
So what kind of girl are you?

174
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:17,328
Let's just say I'm not the
kind of girl who chats up...

175
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,868
...with strangers at nightclubs

176
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,699
So then what do you classify a girl...

177
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,636
...who watches a guy
all night observing...

178
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,470
...the kind of girls
he's hitting upon?

179
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:28,673
I was only watching you because...

180
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,941
Because you wanted me
to come hit on you...

181
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:32,880
...but when I didn't
you got frustrated...

182
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,680
...and decided to bump into me
yourself so that I'd notice you

183
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:38,051
Excuse me! You bumped into me

184
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:40,447
And I only watched you because...

185
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,517
Seeing you chase girls
was more entertaining

186
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:46,358
...than talking to the boring
snobs I am here with tonight

187
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,057
Really?
- Really

188
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:49,864
Best of luck in finding someone...

189
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,993
...to put you on a lease
because that's where you belong

190
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,003
Rohan, by looking at
your flop show tonight,

191
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,301
I think you might
just have to read it now

192
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:06,276
First get your silly love guide
to help you get some action Abhay

193
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,578
...then talk.

194
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,345
Hey, I am not looking for action

195
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:11,518
I am looking for real thing

196
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:12,953
I'm looking for love

197
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,522
Not bad, Abhay

198
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:17,988
Hey, that's actually not a bad line

199
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:20,855
Page 10, Abhay's love guide

200
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:22,694
Read it because you need it

201
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,864
Just because I'm impressed
doesn't mean I need it...

202
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:30,767
Hey, I'm the master and
masters never need any help!

203
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,876
You're all here because
you scored the highest...

204
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,004
...on the Securities Exam

205
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:38,781
But that only ensures you a
place here for the next 3 months

206
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:41,317
After that only the
ten best will survive

207
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,716
The ten who make the highest sales

208
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:44,014
Who do you think the other
eight survivors are going to be?

209
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:46,448
Why just eight? Ask me who I
think the other nine are going to be?

210
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:47,854
Hey, I was just giving you
the benefit of the doubt...

211
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:50,519
...but since you insist, I'll
cross you off my survivor list

212
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:53,428
You'll be paid 3
lakh rupees for 3 months

213
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:57,399
After that the survivors
will get a base plus commission

214
00:12:57,468 --> 00:12:58,935
And the rookie who finishes first...

215
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,867
...will get an apartment and
car from the firm, free of cost

216
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:03,535
Number one, baby.
- Dream on, buddy

217
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:04,699
And to help you master
your client sales pitch...

218
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,709
...the firm's best brokers will
give you a lecture everyday...

219
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:08,745
...for the next two weeks

220
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:12,372
Today you'll start your
lecture series with Vikram Khurrana

221
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,845
Vikram has won the firm's top
salesmanship award every year...

222
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,384
...since he joined the firm

223
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:18,684
And he also holds
the rookie sales record

224
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:20,855
Anyone who beats his record...

225
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:22,822
...will be given a
bonus of 20 lakh rupees

226
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:25,826
That bonus has my
name written all over it

227
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,356
So you think you can break my record?

228
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,998
Yes, I think I can do this

229
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,662
Many have tried before but failed

230
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:35,966
So what makes you so sure of yourself?

231
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,571
Charisma, I've got it and
they probably didn't have it

232
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,606
Everyone, this is Vikram Khurrana

233
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:47,614
I am going to cut through all the
BS and get straight to the point

234
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,946
You are all here because this
is the only corporate job...

235
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:53,546
...in the world that can make
you a millionaire over-night

236
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:55,915
There's no magic
formula to achieve this...

237
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:57,983
...but if you follow
my simple rules...

238
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,552
...you can get there faster

239
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,755
Rule 1: Be confident!

240
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:04,392
Rich people will invest through you...

241
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,992
...if you confidently
make them believe...

242
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,271
...you have the ability to get
into a stock before it rises...

243
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:09,737
...and out before it falls

244
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,401
I don't know him but I
already like him because...

245
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,001
...he has confidence

246
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,344
If the rookie record
wasn't set by me...

247
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,575
...then I'd certainly
root for him to break it

248
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,744
His confidence has me believing in him

249
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,679
Rule 2: Don't ever get
emotionally attached to your clients

250
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,323
Your job is not to find
safe high yielding stocks...

251
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,453
...for them to invest their
money in for the long term

252
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:34,993
Your job is to take
their money and churn it...

253
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,699
...through as many
stocks as possible because...

254
00:14:38,869 --> 00:14:42,032
...you earn for every
transaction you make

255
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:45,401
And rule 3: There are no rules

256
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:48,040
So do whatever it takes
but always show results

257
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:51,779
Welcome to the firm,
may the best survive

258
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,858
See, on the first day itself
I have made a fine impression

259
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:04,518
I thought he was
going to slaughter you

260
00:15:04,595 --> 00:15:06,961
Charisma, baby, charisma

261
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,889
Charisma, my ****.

262
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,798
Hi, we haven't met

263
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,396
I am Rohan and this is my friend Abhay

264
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:21,342
Akash, the sky... Always on top

265
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,609
Hey, I only needed
to know your name...

266
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:27,283
...not the position
you **** your mates from

267
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:29,847
But I've got to give it to you?

268
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:33,715
It takes courage to be
honest about your sexuality

269
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,451
We need more people
like you in this world!

270
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,658
All kudos to you man!

271
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:53,906
"It's such a perfect life."

272
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:56,377
"I know I got to share now."

273
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:59,381
Mr. Bandari, I've got information...

274
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,815
...that will make you 3
to 10 times your money!

275
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,914
My sources tell me
India's number one investor...

276
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:08,549
...Mr. Rajesh Khunkhunwala is
going to invest in Hindustan Labs

277
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,992
"This is my ever-changing world."

278
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,864
"This is my ever-changing world."

279
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:20,926
Hindustan Labs is going to 2000

280
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,803
And I think you need to
buy 10000 shares in it today!

281
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,466
I will call you back, ok!

282
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:29,444
"This is my ever-changing world."

283
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:32,414
"It's such a perfect life."

284
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,677
"I know I got to share now."

285
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,769
"This is my ever-changing world."

286
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,368
Okay sir

287
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,765
Thank you, sir. Ok, I will
wait for your call sir, thank you!

288
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:01,868
"This is my ever-changing world."

289
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,705
That's not a problem sir

290
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:06,746
The stocks in your portfolio
which aren't performing...

291
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,718
...we can sell those and
invest the money in Hindustan Labs

292
00:17:09,953 --> 00:17:12,285
Yes, of course, sir...
the news is confirmed

293
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:14,381
Mr. Khunkhunwala is
investing in this stock

294
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:15,922
I will send the
papers across right way

295
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,585
Thank you

296
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:19,387
Yessss!

297
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,662
Whatever happened to your charisma?

298
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:29,365
Oh I forgot, you never had any

299
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:35,903
Hey!
- Hi

300
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:37,744
You know we're both quite alike

301
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,311
I too came to this firm on merit...

302
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,853
...and not because of
some rich family connections

303
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:49,352
But that's where our similarity ends

304
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,587
Unlike you I never
once under performed

305
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,370
I always showed results even if
it meant going against the rule

306
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,273
You're saying I
should break the rules?

307
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:11,846
Do you really think those rich
kids are getting in to the top ten...

308
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,248
...by following the rules?

309
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:18,947
My friend. Remember rule
number 3, there are no rules

310
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,383
Rohan, if you need to
invest your own money...

311
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:25,257
...to succeed as a
stockbroker then you seriously...

312
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:27,495
...should think of another
more stable career option

313
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,826
Dad, you're never going to get it

314
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,824
A stockbroker can
earn a crore a year...

315
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:33,667
...and no one will even bats an eyelid

316
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,634
So can you give the
insurance money or not?

317
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,738
The money is yours

318
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:41,700
Your mom would have
wanted you to have it

319
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:44,942
But I just can't give it to you to
throw away like this, I just can't

320
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:48,580
Okay. Thanks for your time, Dad

321
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:51,286
I got to go, bye

322
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,855
I will speak to you
before the market closes, ok

323
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:00,922
So, what did your father say?

324
00:19:02,632 --> 00:19:03,690
He didn't agree

325
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,325
I thought so

326
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:06,528
Okay, tell you what

327
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,428
I will connect you with some
high net worth investors...

328
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:11,297
...and then let's see how you perform

329
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:14,232
I know that once I get on the
same field as these rich kids...

330
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,412
...I'll definitely
knock them out of the park

331
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:17,638
That's the spirit

332
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,338
Then let's start tonight

333
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:21,450
Get yourself ready for a party

334
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:31,290
Nice?
- Nice

335
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:36,458
Do you recognize her?
- No

336
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:38,898
Amrita Singhania

337
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:43,635
the most well
connected lady of this circuit

338
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:46,705
Not only can she acquaint
you with the high and mighty...

339
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,605
...she also has crores
herself to invest with

340
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,648
If a broker finds her patronage...

341
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,682
...there's no looking back for him

342
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:59,412
Come on, I will introduce you.
- Let's go

343
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:09,332
First time I am seeing you without
a pretty young thing by your side

344
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:12,497
Losing your charm, is it?
- Not a chance

345
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:15,300
But when clients like yourself...

346
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:17,897
...make me work so hard
where's the time for pleasure

347
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:20,674
Don't put the entire blame on me

348
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,813
Your hunger for money won't
allow you to rest either, Vikram

349
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,038
Hello
- Hi

350
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:28,842
Vikram's told me so much about you

351
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,380
He says you're going to be the
next big thing on Dalal Street

352
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,553
If I get clients like yourself,
I'm sure I can make that happen

353
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,428
It'll be fun getting to know you

354
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:43,694
Make yourself comfortable

355
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,493
I'll be back in a bit

356
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:46,797
Sure
- Thanks

357
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:53,842
Finally I see the charisma in action

358
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:58,478
Keep it up and you'll
have her entire circuit...

359
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:01,840
...eating out of your hands

360
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,346
Well done
- Thanks

361
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:29,403
Do you have a habit of sitting
at other people's table uninvited?

362
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,807
If other people
continuously refuse my invites...

363
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:33,873
...then I'm not left
with many options, am I?

364
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,748
Here's an option, leave them alone!

365
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,318
Do you guys know each other?

366
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:40,614
Bumping into someone twice...

367
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,987
...doesn't exactly
account for knowing them!

368
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:44,390
Oh, so you've been
counting our meetings

369
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:47,596
Were you waiting in
anticipation for out next one?

370
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:49,955
Unfortunately, its hard to forget...

371
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:51,864
...the horrific incidents of my life

372
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:54,595
Great, at least I've
made an impression

373
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:58,598
Oh, so you're the guy who
Neha's been talking about...

374
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:01,008
...for the past 2 weeks!

375
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:05,273
Hi, I am Shivangi
- Hi, Shivangi

376
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:08,474
Now I think I'm even more
indebted to your friend Neha here.

377
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,448
If she hadn't saved my life...

378
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,281
...I would have never gotten
a chance to meet someone...

379
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:13,583
...as beautiful as you

380
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:16,518
pleasure to meet you

381
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:18,517
The pleasure is all mine

382
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:23,557
Now that you have
exchanged pleasantries...

383
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,602
...can you leave us alone, thanks

384
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,763
Not before you agree to
let me take you out on a date

385
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:30,530
That's not happening

386
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:31,699
Then how about a dance?

387
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:33,866
That's also not happening!
- What are you afraid of?

388
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:35,501
That I will leave
you behind in the dust?

389
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:48,882
"Heart."

390
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:52,792
"The jogi comes and entraps me"

391
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:56,730
"The jogi comes and entraps me"

392
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,634
"And stings me with
his poisonous gaze"

393
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:04,435
"And stings me with
his poisonous gaze"

394
00:23:04,507 --> 00:23:08,841
"And stings me with
his poisonous gaze"

395
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:12,006
"Get down on it, get down on it"

396
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:14,680
"The heart says
- let it say"

397
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:16,015
"The breeze is intoxicating"

398
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,583
"The heart says
- let it say"

399
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:19,986
"The breeze is exhilarating"

400
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,485
"The heart says
- let it say"

401
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,856
"Something has happened"

402
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:28,523
"Because its chasing you aimlessly"

403
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,029
"The heart strums about"

404
00:23:32,335 --> 00:23:33,927
"The speakers burst aloud"

405
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:36,767
"But you can't get
me grooving, go away"

406
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:39,841
"The heart strums about"

407
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:41,809
"The speakers burst aloud"

408
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,472
"That's the way I want
to groove you, come along"

409
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,557
"Come lets fall in love"

410
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:06,363
"No, no, no, no."

411
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:08,427
"No don't fall in love with me"

412
00:24:08,505 --> 00:24:12,339
Come let's slowly
hum the song of love"

413
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,275
"No, no, no, no."

414
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,278
"No I don't want to hum any song"

415
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:18,610
Come let's fall in love"

416
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:20,512
"And hum it's song"

417
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,780
"cause I don't want
this love story to remain"

418
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:26,355
"just a tale"

419
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:28,287
"The heart strums about"

420
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:30,292
"The speakers burst aloud"

421
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,828
"But you can't get
me grooving, go away"

422
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,931
"The heart strums about"

423
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:37,864
"The speakers burst aloud"

424
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,562
"That's the way I want
to groove you, come along"

425
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:45,033
"The jogi comes and entraps me"

426
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:48,902
"The jogi comes and entraps me"

427
00:24:48,978 --> 00:24:52,880
"And stings me with
his poisonous gaze"

428
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:56,680
"And stings me with
his poisonous gaze"

429
00:24:56,753 --> 00:25:00,689
"And stings me with
his poisonous gaze"

430
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:04,716
"I'm going to imprint
your face on my heart"

431
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,489
"No, no, no, no."

432
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:08,428
"Stop blowing your broken trumpet"

433
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:12,434
I'm going to ban all
other girls from my heart"

434
00:25:12,502 --> 00:25:14,299
"No, no, no, no."

435
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,270
"Stop with all your fake attitude"

436
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:18,534
"I'm going to imprint
your face on my heart"

437
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:20,542
"And ban all the other girls"

438
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,339
"If you say move, I'll move"

439
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:26,405
"If you say freeze, I'll freeze"

440
00:25:30,386 --> 00:25:33,549
"Heart."

441
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:35,853
"Hey, the breeze is intoxicating"

442
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,859
"The breeze is exhilarating"

443
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:41,328
"Something has happened"

444
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:43,729
"The breeze is intoxicating"

445
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,700
"The breeze is exhilarating"

446
00:25:45,768 --> 00:25:47,827
"Something has happened"

447
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,509
"The heart strums about"

448
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:55,339
"The speakers burst aloud"

449
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:58,005
"That's the way I want
to groove you, come along"

450
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:01,249
"The heart strums about"

451
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:02,944
"The speakers burst aloud"

452
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:05,813
"But you can't get
me grooving, go away"

453
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:11,918
You guys looked good together

454
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:14,620
Not in my world

455
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,298
He's intelligent,
charming and good looking

456
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,492
What else can you ask for?

457
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:23,632
A cocky,
self-centered, arrogant guy...

458
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:25,831
...who's only got one
thing on his mind...

459
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:27,740
...isn't my idea of Mr. Right!

460
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,973
Neha, you can't judge people like that

461
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:33,545
Give him a chance to
at least prove himself

462
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:35,948
I can judge a person
the moment I see them

463
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,616
How will you ever find Mr. Right...

464
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,417
...if you never give any guy a chance?

465
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,888
Prince Charming won't just pop
out of the blue one fine day!

466
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:45,993
I'll know when he comes

467
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:47,627
Fate will give me a sign!

468
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,424
You seriously need to throw
your filmy ideas of romance...

469
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,694
...out of the window

470
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:53,998
Stuff like that doesn't
happen in the real world!

471
00:26:54,504 --> 00:26:56,972
Well, it's going to happen to me!

472
00:26:58,741 --> 00:26:59,765
Whaaat?

473
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,436
So my place tomorrow morning?

474
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:04,639
That sounds like a plan

475
00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:07,714
I'll have the best stocks
ready for you - Thank you

476
00:27:08,985 --> 00:27:10,577
I am impressed, Amrita

477
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:13,883
You've never given out
an invite so fast before

478
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:18,690
That's because you've
not given me a reason...

479
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:19,955
...to relent this time

480
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,927
Rohan, looks like your investment's...

481
00:27:26,803 --> 00:27:28,464
...leaving without
paying you a dividend

482
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:32,272
Bye.
- Not if I can help it

483
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:34,738
I always collect my dividend

484
00:27:41,317 --> 00:27:42,978
See, even they think he is cute

485
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,446
I don't know about that...

486
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:49,291
Hey. Won't I get a goodbye kiss?

487
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:53,295
Yeah, right. I will never
kiss you even in my dreams

488
00:27:53,396 --> 00:27:54,920
You didn't say that on the dance floor

489
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,898
You were lost in my eyes

490
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,928
Stop being so difficult and
let me take you out on a date

491
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,729
Firstly, you were lost in my eyes

492
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:05,841
And second I don't
believe in casual dating

493
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:07,773
So stop following me

494
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:09,869
Who said anything about casual dating?

495
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:12,309
I am looking for the real thing

496
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:13,910
I am looking for love

497
00:28:18,388 --> 00:28:21,289
Well... I am not

498
00:28:21,557 --> 00:28:22,649
So go look elsewhere

499
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,623
Hey. Its not like
I'm asking you to be...

500
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:26,889
...the mother of my children,
I just want to...

501
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,489
...take you out on a date!

502
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:30,994
I don't think any
girl would want to be...

503
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:32,859
...the mother of your children

504
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,596
What is the chance of two strangers...

505
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:38,264
...meeting three
times in three weeks...

506
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,831
...in a city with 20 crore people?

507
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,270
Maybe fate's got
something in store for us...

508
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:45,273
...and you're not
giving it a chance to happen

509
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:48,807
Even he believes in fate!

510
00:28:49,652 --> 00:28:50,914
There's your sign

511
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:54,682
Okay, fine

512
00:28:57,894 --> 00:28:59,418
Just one date

513
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:02,524
What?
- Phone

514
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:07,963
Here, this is my number...

515
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:10,898
...and if you don't
call its perfectly fine

516
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:12,869
I won't miss a heartbeat

517
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,593
So how is Dalal Street's
latest superstar's morning?

518
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:36,958
Couldn't be better. Enjoying the view

519
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:38,358
It's beautiful

520
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,337
It sure is

521
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:47,502
Ma'am, Ajay is on the line

522
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:50,735
Tell him I will talk to him later.,

523
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,346
And send me my pills

524
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,507
Sure ma'am

525
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:56,450
Come, let's talk

526
00:30:03,526 --> 00:30:06,927
So, did you get your dividend?

527
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:09,494
Yes, I had to

528
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:12,827
Confidence

529
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:14,427
I like it

530
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:17,362
Yeah, it comes with the package

531
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:25,445
Ma'am, Ajay says it's important

532
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:27,540
He needs to talk to you urgently

533
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:35,754
Make a wish, I'll be right back

534
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:39,424
Only on the condition that
you'll make it come true

535
00:30:40,496 --> 00:30:41,986
I will definitely try

536
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,543
An urgent meeting has come up

537
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:05,382
Ma'am will have to call you later

538
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:15,523
I will do it. Yes,
sir. It will be done

539
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:17,365
Okay, sir.
- What's up?

540
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,925
Rohan, Hindustan Labs is going up

541
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:22,300
Sell your client's shares
and book profits quickly

542
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,837
Notice that the night
you're not with me...

543
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,310
...I get a go ahead
from my wine stain and...

544
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:31,778
...I meet a powerful personality
who's eager to invest through me

545
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:34,607
Imagine what would happen...

546
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:36,582
...if I stopped hanging
out with you all together?

547
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,753
Let's see when she
actually invests through you

548
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:43,383
And after trying three times
anyone can get a pity date

549
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:45,017
Watch by the end of the week...

550
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:46,488
...I'll bag Amrita's
investments and...

551
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:49,690
...I'll get more than
a pity date from Neha

552
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:52,864
When was the last
time I was wrong, Rohan?

553
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:54,766
Ah...
- Exactly

554
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:57,598
Don't worry, there's always
a first time for everything

555
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,570
But not you losing
your virginity of course

556
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:01,834
That you'll remain for a lifetime!

557
00:32:14,824 --> 00:32:16,382
The spiritual date.

558
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:17,653
The ultimate date.

559
00:32:41,684 --> 00:32:44,812
I didn't get ready
for a date at 10 am...

560
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:46,718
...so you could stare at my face

561
00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:48,547
This day better be worth it

562
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:51,988
It won't just be worth it,
it'll be unforgettable

563
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,061
Yes, nightmares
usually are unforgettable

564
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:08,810
Why are we at the temple?

565
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:10,968
Because today's an auspicious day

566
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:14,480
And what's so auspicious about today?

567
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,577
It's our first date, what can
be more auspicious than that?

568
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:23,515
Do you really expect me to
fall for your cheesy lines?

569
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:26,820
You fell for my lines
on fate, didn't you?

570
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:32,990
Well... I... can't go
in dressed like this

571
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:35,337
So you carry on and
I'll just wait right here

572
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:39,002
You know it's
inauspicious to come to a temple...

573
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:41,999
...and not go inside

574
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:45,870
So I brought you this, just
in case you weren't prepared

575
00:33:47,383 --> 00:33:48,873
Go on, open it

576
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:50,537
What?

577
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:52,409
Why do you look so surprised?

578
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,410
Who says I am surprised?

579
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:55,973
It's written all over your face

580
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:59,050
You want to know
what's written on my face

581
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:02,585
That you're going to spend the
rest of your day with a desi girl...

582
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:04,717
...because now that I'm in
these clothes I'm not getting out

583
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:07,557
Good, I'm actually a
sucker for the desi look!

584
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,990
Just looking at you now is
making me go weak in the knees

585
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:14,767
And also this look is
perfect for our next destination

586
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:17,370
And what's our next destination?

587
00:35:55,878 --> 00:35:58,039
What were you
praying for so intensely?

588
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:00,474
I can only tell you
that once we've gone...

589
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:01,876
...to all our destinations

590
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:04,013
How many more places do we have left?

591
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:06,517
Are you not enjoying
our spiritual date...

592
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,487
...or did you not
expect such a date from me?

593
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:12,419
The latter, definitely

594
00:36:12,528 --> 00:36:14,393
Hasn't anyone ever told you...

595
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:16,326
...never to judge a book by it's cover

596
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:19,299
When the cover makes
up the entire book...

597
00:36:19,368 --> 00:36:21,393
...there's not much left to judge

598
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:17,725
Do you still want to know
what I was praying for all day?

599
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:20,453
Ah...

600
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,823
yes... I do...

601
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:25,591
I was asking God for
more days like this

602
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,732
More days in your
company and not just one date

603
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,396
So was today the
nightmare you won't forget?

604
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,568
Let's just say it was
something I didn't expect

605
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,970
So will I see you again?

606
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,505
Depends on what my heart tells me

607
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,876
And what's your heart telling you?

608
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,978
To be careful

609
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:18,852
What's it afraid of?

610
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:22,415
It's only made for one person

611
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,691
It needs to be sure
who that person is...

612
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:26,886
...before it gives itself away

613
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:31,660
Wow, a girl with traditional ideals

614
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:34,867
I didn't know your kind
still existed in the world today

615
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:36,629
Yeah,

616
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:40,699
we're an exclusive breed now

617
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,936
So you've never had
a boyfriend before?

618
00:38:43,512 --> 00:38:44,979
There were many interested

619
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:47,777
But no one's been
able to measure up...

620
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,477
...to the standards of my heart

621
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:53,279
That was before I came along, right?

622
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:55,020
Ah...

623
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:57,822
Call me when your heart feels...

624
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,420
...I measure up to its standards

625
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,327
Thanks for the date

626
00:39:06,435 --> 00:39:08,494
I'll treasure it forever

627
00:39:22,484 --> 00:39:23,746
Here you go...

628
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:26,579
Thanks for the car,
Vikram, I really appreciate it

629
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,847
We definitely need to make a pit stop

630
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,020
You can't come wearing that

631
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:33,487
We going somewhere?

632
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,791
We're going to Amrita's
latest artists' launch

633
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:40,962
The best place for you
to showcase your charisma

634
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,532
Let's fly
- Alright

635
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:48,301
Thank you

636
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:53,609
Hello...

637
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,742
One photograph, sir.

638
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,046
Sir, please.
- Sir, one here.

639
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:00,581
Good?

640
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,920
Sir, sir, one here.
- Mr. Vikram.

641
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:07,458
Come on, this way

642
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:09,690
What do you think?
- Nice

643
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:10,890
Come

644
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,063
I've got to take this

645
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:16,836
Excuse me for a second, but...

646
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:18,964
...you go work your charm
- I will

647
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,605
Hello, yes...

648
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:25,743
But if you look at
that canvas, it's a...

649
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:28,908
I'll be back... just a minute

650
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,922
I hope you're not going
to disappear on me today

651
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,322
I think it was the other way round

652
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,923
You left me hanging for some Ajay

653
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:45,862
I assure you that won't happen again

654
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,002
So when are we meeting again?

655
00:40:48,504 --> 00:40:50,631
Well... oh... oh...

656
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,343
I'm terribly sorry but I'll
have to leave you hanging again

657
00:40:57,346 --> 00:40:59,337
Need to go say hello
to my dear mom-in-law

658
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:04,944
Hello

659
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,447
Good
- Yes, good

660
00:41:09,691 --> 00:41:11,352
Didn't think she was the type...

661
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:14,594
...to be so close to
her mother-in-law...

662
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:17,322
...so many years
after her husband's death

663
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:20,928
Amrita is a clever businessman

664
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,867
Her husband's Will entitles her to
a third of his 5000 crore empire...

665
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,842
...only if she remains single
for 10 years after his death

666
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:32,003
And if she gets into a
relationship before that...

667
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:34,381
...her entire share goes to her
mother-in-law and to his kids...

668
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:35,711
...from his first marriage

669
00:41:36,852 --> 00:41:38,444
One second, Vikram
- Sure

670
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,817
I'll be right back

671
00:41:49,531 --> 00:41:50,623
Hello

672
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:55,364
So, do I measure up to the
standards of your heart now?

673
00:41:56,572 --> 00:41:57,664
Maybe...

674
00:41:58,073 --> 00:42:00,041
That maybe sounds like a yes

675
00:42:00,776 --> 00:42:02,368
I didn't say that

676
00:42:02,678 --> 00:42:05,442
If it's a yes, you
can tell your heart...

677
00:42:05,514 --> 00:42:06,879
...it won't be disappointed

678
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:13,581
I'm sorry my heart doesn't
like receiving passed on messages

679
00:42:13,755 --> 00:42:15,620
You'll have to tell it yourself

680
00:42:16,358 --> 00:42:18,656
Your heart's quite complicated

681
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:21,592
Yeah, it's very complicated

682
00:42:21,797 --> 00:42:24,391
Sometimes even I can't understand it

683
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:28,434
Well, then I'll have to undo
its complications when we meet

684
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:33,441
And who said we're meeting again?

685
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:35,906
If we weren't, you wouldn't
have messaged me back so soon

686
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:38,808
So dinner tomorrow night?

687
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,714
Umm... dinner...

688
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:44,684
Don't worry, by saying yes
your image won't go for a toss

689
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:47,681
You'll still be a
traditional girl in my eyes

690
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:52,385
Good, because I'd like to keep
my exclusive tag alive still

691
00:42:52,494 --> 00:42:54,325
And the invite goes
out to your heart as well

692
00:42:54,563 --> 00:42:55,757
So make sure you don't
forget to bring it along

693
00:42:56,331 --> 00:42:58,492
Oh, thanks... how thoughtful of you

694
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,729
Alright, bye

695
00:43:01,336 --> 00:43:02,462
See you

696
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:08,703
Morning, Superstar...

697
00:43:08,777 --> 00:43:10,039
Checkout page 3!

698
00:43:20,656 --> 00:43:23,318
Sorry, I don't give out autographs

699
00:43:23,725 --> 00:43:25,784
Good, no one's even asking for one

700
00:43:26,662 --> 00:43:28,721
Guess who's meeting
Amrita in Alibaug...

701
00:43:28,797 --> 00:43:29,991
...and getting
unlimited fund to trade with...

702
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,362
...on the markets today?

703
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,526
Don't count your
chickens before they're hatched

704
00:43:33,602 --> 00:43:35,399
They've already hatched

705
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,370
I am just going over to collect them

706
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:39,373
Why are you only
relying on Amrita, Rohan?

707
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:41,306
You should continue
pursuing your other investors also

708
00:43:41,343 --> 00:43:42,742
Who needs other
investors when I know...

709
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:46,542
...she'll give me enough money
to play with to go to the top

710
00:43:46,648 --> 00:43:50,015
It's about working smarter,
Abhay, not harder

711
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:52,943
There's a difference between
working smarter and being lazy, Rohan

712
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:54,716
And right now you're
definitely being lazy

713
00:43:54,957 --> 00:43:56,720
If I wasn't working smarter...

714
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,325
...then why would Neha
call me back so soon?

715
00:43:59,761 --> 00:44:01,422
You're going to be
proven wrong, Abhay...

716
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,929
...about Neha and Amrita

717
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:05,667
I'll believe it when I see it

718
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:07,801
But hey, you were right
about one thing though

719
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,930
Neha definitely is a girl with a heart

720
00:44:12,808 --> 00:44:14,275
Thanks for the tip

721
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,776
You sun of a gun,
you used my love guide!

722
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:19,676
And that too, my best dating tip ever

723
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:20,976
The spiritual date!

724
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:22,448
This wasn't part of the rules

725
00:44:22,517 --> 00:44:26,613
Hey, you just said I
couldn't get more that a pity date

726
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:29,987
You didn't say what I
could do or could not use

727
00:44:30,392 --> 00:44:33,418
Obviously, it's easy
once you use my love guide

728
00:44:33,495 --> 00:44:34,928
Anyone can do it

729
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,523
So why has it never
worked for you, Abhay

730
00:44:37,733 --> 00:44:41,294
That's because I haven't found
the one to try my moves on yet

731
00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:43,868
At the rate you're going,
it looks like...

732
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:45,839
...that will only
happen in your next lifetime

733
00:44:55,784 --> 00:45:00,778
I bet your other clients don't
offer you such relaxing services

734
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,517
Am I right?

735
00:45:02,824 --> 00:45:04,587
That's because they
don't know my true worth

736
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:09,888
And what is your true worth?

737
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:13,027
That I have the ability
to quadruple your money!

738
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:14,828
Have a look at these stocks

739
00:45:15,037 --> 00:45:16,436
They are new companies...

740
00:45:16,538 --> 00:45:18,028
...that haven't been picked up yet

741
00:45:20,308 --> 00:45:24,267
Do you really think I
don't know about them already?

742
00:45:24,746 --> 00:45:31,345
But I know the best time to get
in and out to maximize profits

743
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,584
You don't need to use
your sales pitch on me

744
00:45:34,689 --> 00:45:36,520
You have already got my attention

745
00:45:36,992 --> 00:45:39,927
I just need to know
what you're capable of

746
00:45:39,995 --> 00:45:42,793
Just give me a
chance and I will show you

747
00:45:43,498 --> 00:45:45,295
Okay then, show me

748
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,535
What can you do with my
under performing stocks?

749
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,439
Your under performing stocks?

750
00:45:52,507 --> 00:45:57,809
Yeah, show me what
you can do with them...

751
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:01,707
...and I'll show you
what I can do for you

752
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:06,978
Relax, she's not an
easy woman to please

753
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:10,852
Consider yourself lucky that
she's taken a liking to you...

754
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:12,587
...and giving you
something to play with so soon

755
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:15,289
I just thought that
she'd give me more to invest

756
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,997
I didn't expect peanuts

757
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:19,297
Just keep working your charm

758
00:46:19,367 --> 00:46:21,995
Show her results and soon...

759
00:46:22,704 --> 00:46:25,969
...she'll give you
exactly what you want

760
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,011
You know what I love
the most about fireworks?

761
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,343
That a small spark of light...

762
00:46:38,453 --> 00:46:40,387
...can conquer the
darkness of the sky...

763
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:42,457
...and spread brightness all around

764
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,757
Hello, I'm finally
living in the moment...

765
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,764
...and sharing my thoughts here...

766
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:52,729
...and you're not even listening

767
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:56,367
Sorry, I was just
looking at the fireworks

768
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,403
Ah, the fireworks are
bursting in the sky...

769
00:46:59,474 --> 00:47:00,771
...and not on my face

770
00:47:01,343 --> 00:47:03,538
I was watching the ones
bursting in your heart

771
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:07,405
They're more beautiful than
the ones bursting in the sky

772
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:14,282
"I have found the moon in your eyes"

773
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:17,284
"O resplendent sky what should I do"

774
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,321
"On these sleepless nights?"

775
00:48:20,388 --> 00:48:25,985
"Place your restless
heartbeat on my hand..."

776
00:48:26,428 --> 00:48:31,832
Place your knotted
breath on my breath...

777
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,861
"My eyes feel shy... as
they travel across your face"

778
00:48:37,939 --> 00:48:43,935
"My eyes feel shy... as
they travel across your face"

779
00:48:44,012 --> 00:48:49,382
"How do I convey the
story of my heart?

780
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:55,812
"Love is not expressed through words"

781
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:01,795
"Its conveyed through the eyes"

782
00:49:01,863 --> 00:49:07,802
"Love is not expressed through words"

783
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:15,275
"Its conveyed through the eyes"

784
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:43,598
"Why is your face so anxious?"

785
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:49,502
"Why is there a
hesitancy in your gait?"

786
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:55,906
"The heart is scared to
tread the path of love"

787
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:01,753
"So meet me a little distance away"

788
00:50:02,057 --> 00:50:07,518
"Why the need for distance when
our hearts have already become one"

789
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:13,894
"Love is not expressed through words"

790
00:50:13,968 --> 00:50:19,838
"Its conveyed through the eyes"

791
00:50:19,908 --> 00:50:25,847
"Love is not expressed through words"

792
00:50:25,914 --> 00:50:33,411
"Its conveyed through the eyes"

793
00:50:56,111 --> 00:51:01,981
"My heart has drifted towards someone"

794
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:08,446
"There is a new sensation in breath"

795
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:14,052
"This happens to everyone,
now it's happened to you"

796
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:19,967
"All your dreams
have finally come true"

797
00:51:20,034 --> 00:51:25,666
"I don't know how my world has turned"

798
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:31,901
"Love is not expressed through words"

799
00:51:31,946 --> 00:51:37,942
"Its conveyed through the eyes"

800
00:51:38,052 --> 00:51:43,888
"Love is not expressed through words"

801
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:51,091
"Its conveyed through the eyes"

802
00:51:54,035 --> 00:51:56,230
Hey.

803
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,932
Morning, boys.
- Morning

804
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,989
So... Is Vikram pimping you out...

805
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:16,683
...or is he keeping
you all for himself?

806
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,594
Okay, at least just
tell me how it was?

807
00:52:20,662 --> 00:52:21,754
Did you enjoy it?

808
00:52:21,796 --> 00:52:24,287
Not as much as you enjoyed it...

809
00:52:24,466 --> 00:52:26,058
...being pimped by your Dad!

810
00:52:27,869 --> 00:52:29,598
Watch your mouth there, pretty boy!

811
00:52:29,637 --> 00:52:31,764
I'll watch it when you watch yours!

812
00:52:32,574 --> 00:52:34,542
What are you going to do if I don't?

813
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:36,376
Tell daddy Vikram?

814
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,672
I am scared...

815
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,743
Whatever man!

816
00:52:46,688 --> 00:52:49,384
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

817
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:53,687
You two in my office. Now!

818
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:59,766
Forget it. The client's screaming.

819
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:03,635
If I hear anything about
the two of you ever again...

820
00:53:04,506 --> 00:53:08,374
...I swear that will be
your last day in the firm.

821
00:53:10,011 --> 00:53:11,376
Is that understood?

822
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:12,839
Yes, sir!

823
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,815
Good morning, Bombay Bulls.

824
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:18,677
Just a moment.

825
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,651
Bombay Bulls...

826
00:53:21,122 --> 00:53:22,419
Bombay Bulls, yes?

827
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,052
Hello.

828
00:53:27,428 --> 00:53:28,759
Hello, Mr. Bhandari

829
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,027
there's nothing I can do if
you don't reply to me instantly

830
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:34,463
Your stock is now gone to the pits

831
00:53:34,536 --> 00:53:35,833
No one's going to buy it now

832
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,662
I'm sorry, Mr. Bhandari

833
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:38,933
I really am

834
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:47,976
What if Amrita drops then
you'll be the pits, Rohan

835
00:53:48,049 --> 00:53:50,483
Treat your other
clients with some respect

836
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:52,878
And how many spots did you
climb up this week, Abhay?

837
00:53:53,087 --> 00:53:55,612
Oh, I forgot. You didn't

838
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,952
Every dog has his day, Rohan

839
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,583
Don't worry, I'll also have mine

840
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,786
Really?

841
00:54:01,796 --> 00:54:02,922
Yeah, baby

842
00:54:02,997 --> 00:54:05,659
Oh my, God. Oh my, God.
Oh my, God... ahhhhhhhhhhh

843
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:09,760
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

844
00:54:09,837 --> 00:54:12,362
Rohan, I know
today's your day and all...

845
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,998
...but you really don't need
to go to town barking about it

846
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:15,401
Right

847
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,568
Hey, baby...

848
00:54:16,678 --> 00:54:17,770
Why are you screaming?

849
00:54:17,979 --> 00:54:19,571
Because you are

850
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,582
So there must be
something to celebrate, right?

851
00:54:23,351 --> 00:54:25,717
I got my first big campaign

852
00:54:25,787 --> 00:54:27,721
I'm going to be the
next 'Forever 20 Girl'!

853
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:30,053
Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God...

854
00:54:33,628 --> 00:54:34,925
How come you are not screaming now?

855
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,622
Just wanted to listen to
the excitement in your voice

856
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:39,732
Don't want to miss it for the world!

857
00:54:41,035 --> 00:54:43,026
Oh my gosh! I love him,
I love him, I love him!

858
00:54:44,038 --> 00:54:46,336
Hello...
- Hello

859
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:50,806
Sorry, I... was just
catching some breath

860
00:54:50,878 --> 00:54:54,871
"Let yourself go,
baby, let yourself go."

861
00:54:54,949 --> 00:54:58,715
"Let yourself go,
baby, let yourself go."

862
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,381
"Let yourself go,
baby, let yourself go."

863
00:55:02,457 --> 00:55:05,949
"Let yourself go, baby,
let yourself go." - Hi.

864
00:55:07,328 --> 00:55:10,923
"Let yourself go,
baby, let yourself go."

865
00:55:11,032 --> 00:55:14,832
"Let yourself go,
baby, let yourself go."

866
00:55:14,902 --> 00:55:18,736
"I know you feel it
'cause I can see it."

867
00:55:18,806 --> 00:55:22,970
"I know you want to
let love embrace you."

868
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,546
"I know you feel it
'cause I can see it."

869
00:55:33,655 --> 00:55:37,318
"I know you want to
let love embrace you."

870
00:55:37,925 --> 00:55:41,452
"I know you feel it."

871
00:55:41,562 --> 00:55:47,432
"Cause I can see it."

872
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:53,469
"I know you want to."

873
00:55:53,574 --> 00:55:57,305
"Let love embrace you."

874
00:55:57,412 --> 00:56:00,904
"I know you feel it
'cause I can see it."

875
00:56:01,015 --> 00:56:06,783
"I know you want to
let love embrace you."

876
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:14,957
"I know you feel it
'cause I can see it."

877
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:19,464
"I know you want to
let love embrace you."

878
00:56:19,534 --> 00:56:23,595
"I know you feel it
'cause I can see it."

879
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:27,801
"I know you want to
let love embrace you."

880
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:31,471
"Let yourself go.
- I know you feel it"

881
00:56:31,546 --> 00:56:35,277
"Let yourself go.
- I know you want to."

882
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:39,445
"Let yourself go.
- I know you feel it"

883
00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:42,455
"Let yourself go.
- I know you want to."

884
00:57:10,384 --> 00:57:13,319
So, if I wasn't there to
hold your hand tonight...

885
00:57:13,688 --> 00:57:14,848
...how scared would you have been?

886
00:57:15,356 --> 00:57:16,789
If the situation was reversed
and you were scared, Rohan...

887
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,586
...I'm sure I'd hold your hand too

888
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,688
But I don't get scared

889
00:57:21,763 --> 00:57:22,991
Everyone gets scared, Rohan

890
00:57:23,297 --> 00:57:24,662
No matter how macho they maybe

891
00:57:24,832 --> 00:57:27,426
Oh, so you think I'm macho

892
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:33,398
Yes, along with being cocky,
arrogant and conceited

893
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:34,935
And good looking, right

894
00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:36,973
I didn't say that

895
00:57:37,278 --> 00:57:40,679
You did the first time we met

896
00:57:40,982 --> 00:57:43,382
It must have been an error in judgment

897
00:57:43,484 --> 00:57:46,647
But you are never wrong

898
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,988
Oh, no! Quick, run
- No

899
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,056
Let's dance

900
00:57:57,365 --> 00:57:59,629
Are you crazy? It's pouring

901
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,861
Whatever happened to
living in the moment?

902
00:58:02,603 --> 00:58:04,571
Not now, maybe another time!

903
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,802
This moment won't come back again

904
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:09,869
We will live it now

905
00:59:45,973 --> 00:59:48,305
Don't let this moment go...

906
01:01:08,823 --> 01:01:10,484
I love you, Rohan

907
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:38,450
Don't worry... go, go, go

908
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,680
Thank you...

909
01:01:39,754 --> 01:01:41,312
Byeee...

910
01:01:48,763 --> 01:01:52,722
Go, go, go, go

911
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,824
What you doing ya...

912
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,553
Boo... yesss!

913
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:50,448
Rohan, what are the
odds of getting Vikram...

914
01:02:50,524 --> 01:02:51,718
...to help me get
connected with some...

915
01:02:51,826 --> 01:02:53,020
...high net worth investors also?

916
01:02:53,661 --> 01:02:57,529
Wow, the world does turn

917
01:02:57,598 --> 01:02:59,327
Yeah, it does and those
who don't realize that...

918
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,934
So let me know if he can help me out

919
01:03:03,003 --> 01:03:04,698
Okay, Abhay

920
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:09,799
Abhay, just take it
a little easy, okay

921
01:03:10,544 --> 01:03:12,808
Shivangi's had few relationships

922
01:03:13,447 --> 01:03:15,039
I don't want you to set
yourself up for a fall

923
01:03:16,016 --> 01:03:18,712
You know, Rohan... I was going
to say the same thing to you

924
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:20,646
Neha's a good girl

925
01:03:20,888 --> 01:03:22,446
Don't set her up for a fall

926
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,023
If you're not serious
about her, tell her now

927
01:03:25,493 --> 01:03:28,053
She's not someone I'd
set up for a fall, Abhay

928
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,722
She's special

929
01:03:29,997 --> 01:03:33,865
What I feel for her I've
never felt for anyone else before

930
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:36,559
Looks like the world has
turned for you also, Rohan

931
01:03:36,637 --> 01:03:39,834
Yeah, she's spun me
around and brought out...

932
01:03:40,374 --> 01:03:42,501
...the inner child in me again

933
01:03:42,977 --> 01:03:45,445
Have you told her how you feel?

934
01:03:45,913 --> 01:03:47,847
Not yet, it's too soon

935
01:03:48,582 --> 01:03:50,982
It's never too soon,
Rohan when you feel it...

936
01:03:51,085 --> 01:03:53,553
...just tell her, don't wait

937
01:03:53,921 --> 01:03:56,389
What's taking you guys so long?

938
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:58,390
Come on, we can't wait forever!

939
01:03:58,459 --> 01:03:59,858
I was just telling
Rohan the same thing...

940
01:03:59,927 --> 01:04:01,417
...but he just doesn't get it

941
01:04:01,529 --> 01:04:02,723
Come on

942
01:04:17,278 --> 01:04:19,303
I love you, Rohan

943
01:04:43,437 --> 01:04:44,529
Hello

944
01:04:44,605 --> 01:04:45,867
Today the government
is decreasing taxes...

945
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,567
...on the raw materials that the
companies you invested me in...

946
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:49,404
...use to manufacture goods

947
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,575
So what does that mean sleepy head?

948
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,579
That their stocks are going to go up!

949
01:04:53,647 --> 01:04:56,411
Exactly... So wake up
and get in action!

950
01:04:56,584 --> 01:05:00,418
Get us more of those stocks
before the word leaks on the market

951
01:05:00,721 --> 01:05:02,484
When will the news become public?

952
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:05,720
By the evening, so make
hay when the sun shines

953
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:09,462
And once all this goes well, I'm
going to give you want you want

954
01:05:09,863 --> 01:05:11,831
The post of my newest fund manager

955
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:13,391
Oh don't worry

956
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,967
That's a cinch for me

957
01:05:15,035 --> 01:05:16,502
I'm all over it

958
01:05:16,737 --> 01:05:18,432
Am sure you are...

959
01:05:18,505 --> 01:05:20,769
Make hay while the sun shines...

960
01:05:24,511 --> 01:05:26,638
Does she ever leave you alone?

961
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,745
Work, baby, work...

962
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:30,840
Okay, then I better get going also

963
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:32,782
I need to prepare for my big audition

964
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:35,417
You know if I nail it today...

965
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:37,582
...I could get the lead in this movie

966
01:05:37,658 --> 01:05:41,958
I know, baby you told me already

967
01:05:42,896 --> 01:05:45,387
Well, aren't you
going to wish me luck?

968
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,330
Good luck, baby, you're going to rock

969
01:05:57,945 --> 01:05:59,310
Hello, Vishu...

970
01:05:59,613 --> 01:06:00,807
Okay, I'll wait...

971
01:06:01,649 --> 01:06:04,447
Yes, give me 10000 shares of it

972
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:07,353
I thought you had 13000?

973
01:06:07,788 --> 01:06:09,449
Okay, give me those 3000 then

974
01:06:09,556 --> 01:06:10,682
Thanks

975
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:12,253
Yes, Vishu

976
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:13,519
No, nothing special going down

977
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:15,360
Just trying out something new

978
01:06:15,663 --> 01:06:17,324
So can you give me those 9000 shares?

979
01:06:18,032 --> 01:06:19,727
Okay, cool thanks

980
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,825
Looks like you've hit on something?

981
01:06:22,002 --> 01:06:24,664
No, nothing... just doing
a minor portfolio shuffle

982
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:27,499
Rohan, you're going to
speak to Vikram for me, right?

983
01:06:27,574 --> 01:06:30,441
Yes, Abhay I told you I will

984
01:06:32,913 --> 01:06:34,847
Get me all the shares of that company

985
01:06:34,915 --> 01:06:36,041
Okay, thanks

986
01:06:39,353 --> 01:06:40,718
So, how did it go today?

987
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,517
I got us 100000 shares

988
01:06:42,589 --> 01:06:45,820
If I went more, then
SEBI would be on my tail

989
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:48,894
Okay, join me in Goa tomorrow

990
01:06:49,363 --> 01:06:51,388
And we'll discuss your new role...

991
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:53,695
...as my new fund manager

992
01:06:53,967 --> 01:06:56,333
I thought you were coming back today?

993
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,764
I changed my mind

994
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:00,805
This is the perfect place
to celebrate your new role

995
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:03,373
Don't tell me you're
going to bail on me again?

996
01:07:03,844 --> 01:07:06,608
Of course not, I'll be there

997
01:07:06,847 --> 01:07:09,680
Great, see you there
- See you

998
01:07:11,985 --> 01:07:13,282
Neha, just watch now...

999
01:07:13,354 --> 01:07:14,548
I can't imagine

1000
01:07:14,621 --> 01:07:16,816
Watch now
- I mean he's so cute

1001
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,256
Now... just see what
he's going to do now

1002
01:07:20,994 --> 01:07:22,291
Are you serious?

1003
01:07:22,363 --> 01:07:23,728
He was like that

1004
01:07:24,531 --> 01:07:25,759
Hi...

1005
01:07:27,468 --> 01:07:30,028
Dad? What are you doing here?

1006
01:07:30,804 --> 01:07:32,362
Wanted to surprise you

1007
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,406
Can't miss your 25th birthday,
now can I?

1008
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:38,477
That's nice Dad, but I am
not going to be here tomorrow

1009
01:07:38,545 --> 01:07:39,637
I'm going to be in Goa

1010
01:07:40,013 --> 01:07:41,310
Goa?

1011
01:07:41,415 --> 01:07:42,473
Yeah, I am sorry babe

1012
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:44,380
I've meeting with
Amrita there tomorrow

1013
01:07:44,885 --> 01:07:46,375
I'll be back in a day

1014
01:07:47,554 --> 01:07:50,489
A man doesn't turn 25 everyday, Rohan

1015
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:53,626
It's your silver jubilee, it
deserves a special celebration

1016
01:07:54,962 --> 01:07:56,554
Reschedule your meeting

1017
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:59,463
I'm sure your Amrita will understand

1018
01:08:00,334 --> 01:08:03,497
I can't Dad, this
meeting can change my life

1019
01:08:04,505 --> 01:08:05,995
What else do you want to change?

1020
01:08:06,774 --> 01:08:08,708
You already are
living your dream life!

1021
01:08:08,909 --> 01:08:10,877
Everyone can always get more, Dad

1022
01:08:12,246 --> 01:08:13,770
I'll just let the two of you catch up

1023
01:08:14,515 --> 01:08:15,948
It was nice meeting you, uncle

1024
01:08:19,253 --> 01:08:20,811
No baby, just one second

1025
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,551
Sorry baby, I'll make it up
to you next weekend, I promise

1026
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:26,820
Your birthday is this weekend,
not next weekend

1027
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,657
Oh, come on, baby Don't be like that

1028
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,822
If I could cancel, you know I would

1029
01:08:30,931 --> 01:08:32,922
You know this was going to
be our first big occasion...

1030
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:35,433
...we celebrated
together as a couple...

1031
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:39,029
...but now because Amrita
wants you all for herself...

1032
01:08:39,306 --> 01:08:40,500
...we can't even have that

1033
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:42,371
Hey, that's not fair,
she doesn't even know...

1034
01:08:42,443 --> 01:08:43,671
...it's my birthday

1035
01:08:43,777 --> 01:08:45,369
She's just a client

1036
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:48,642
Yeah, a client who wants a
little too much of your time

1037
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:52,344
Baby, this is work, nothing more

1038
01:08:52,686 --> 01:08:54,415
I promise I'll make it up to you

1039
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:59,717
Now, aren't you going to
tell me how your audition went?

1040
01:09:01,295 --> 01:09:04,230
It went well, they liked my test a lot

1041
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:06,259
They'll let me know in a week

1042
01:09:07,701 --> 01:09:09,430
And what else did they say?

1043
01:09:14,842 --> 01:09:19,404
Didn't they say you look beautiful?

1044
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,404
Yes...

1045
01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:27,280
Didn't they say you
look sexy when you're mad?

1046
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:35,692
Didn't they say it's so
easy to fall in love with you?

1047
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,992
Go, your Dad is waiting for you

1048
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,969
I swear, I'll make it up to you

1049
01:09:46,273 --> 01:09:47,501
I'm sure you will

1050
01:09:51,378 --> 01:09:55,337
Oh yes, you look cute in diapers

1051
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:25,774
Always by the water huh, Amrita?

1052
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:32,010
Yes, it cleanses me

1053
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,885
Get yourself a drink

1054
01:10:35,322 --> 01:10:36,550
Should we discuss work first?

1055
01:10:36,657 --> 01:10:38,056
Oh... don't be so boring?

1056
01:10:38,659 --> 01:10:39,921
We can work later

1057
01:10:40,561 --> 01:10:42,028
It's not going anywhere

1058
01:10:44,431 --> 01:10:46,456
Go... get yourself a drink

1059
01:12:44,451 --> 01:12:46,351
"In this paradise, you and I."

1060
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,347
Happy Birthday sweetheart!

1061
01:12:48,422 --> 01:12:49,889
Aren't you glad to see me?

1062
01:12:49,956 --> 01:12:53,824
I couldn't be mad on your birthday...
so I came to surprise you

1063
01:12:54,795 --> 01:12:56,820
Happy Birthday sweetheart!

1064
01:13:17,172 --> 01:13:20,266
Neha, wait... give me
a chance to explain

1065
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:22,471
Neha! Neha!

1066
01:13:22,544 --> 01:13:25,672
Don't touch me. Get your
hands off me. Stay away...

1067
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:27,916
Neha, I know what you
saw looks terrible...

1068
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:29,245
...but let me explain

1069
01:13:29,318 --> 01:13:31,218
You don't need to
explain anything to me, Rohan

1070
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,182
I saw what I needed to see!

1071
01:13:33,388 --> 01:13:35,083
It's not what you think

1072
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:37,053
I don't know what happened last night

1073
01:13:37,259 --> 01:13:38,487
We had too much to drink

1074
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,152
It was a terrible mistake

1075
01:13:40,362 --> 01:13:42,922
If I could go back and
change things I would

1076
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:45,163
I should have listened to my heart...

1077
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:47,494
...when it told me
to be careful, Rohan

1078
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:50,197
I should have never
fallen in love with you

1079
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:52,435
Never!
- Neha

1080
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:55,442
Neha please, let me just explain

1081
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:58,479
What can you possibly explain
that I haven't seen already?

1082
01:13:59,016 --> 01:14:01,644
Or are you now going to tell
me about all the other times...

1083
01:14:01,718 --> 01:14:02,980
...you were with Amrita during
your so called "Business Meetings".

1084
01:14:03,053 --> 01:14:04,145
Neha, don't.

1085
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:07,485
...I never doubted your meetings
with your directors and producers...

1086
01:14:07,558 --> 01:14:09,150
So how can you...
- You just did, Rohan

1087
01:14:14,832 --> 01:14:15,958
You just did

1088
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:19,392
No, that's not what I meant

1089
01:14:20,137 --> 01:14:21,434
Let me finish

1090
01:14:21,505 --> 01:14:23,700
please believe me that this is the
first time that this has happened

1091
01:14:24,374 --> 01:14:28,401
It's a mistake! A horrible,
horrible mistake

1092
01:14:29,546 --> 01:14:32,879
Rohan, the mistake isn't
you sleeping with Amrita

1093
01:14:34,651 --> 01:14:37,119
It's me falling in love with you

1094
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,120
If I could go back and change that...

1095
01:14:44,094 --> 01:14:45,459
...I would

1096
01:14:46,396 --> 01:14:48,489
Neha, wait. Neha! Neha, please!

1097
01:14:51,668 --> 01:14:54,000
Neha wait!
- Airport please!

1098
01:14:57,641 --> 01:14:59,632
Neha, I am sorry...
Just came out all wrong

1099
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:03,703
That is not what I meant Please give me
a chance to explain. Neha I am sorry.

1100
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,715
"The eyes dampen and the heart cries"

1101
01:15:06,783 --> 01:15:09,843
"The eyes dampen and the heart cries"

1102
01:15:09,953 --> 01:15:12,922
"The eyes dampen and the heart cries"

1103
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:16,585
"The eyes dampen and the heart cries"

1104
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:22,724
"The path of love is
strewn with many obstacles"

1105
01:15:22,933 --> 01:15:28,599
"Pierced by shards of
glass and rocky splinters"

1106
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:35,642
"The chest weeps and touches the soul"

1107
01:15:35,879 --> 01:15:38,848
"Searing the pain through heart"

1108
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:42,374
"Searing the pain through heart"

1109
01:15:54,398 --> 01:15:57,094
"The heart has just broken"

1110
01:15:57,568 --> 01:16:03,768
"The dreams have just shattered"

1111
01:16:03,807 --> 01:16:06,970
"The shadows have just disappeared"

1112
01:16:07,044 --> 01:16:13,449
"The lines of
destiny have just fallen"

1113
01:16:14,384 --> 01:16:20,482
"Life has turned its back,
a small voice has spoken"

1114
01:16:20,557 --> 01:16:26,052
"That something has broken between us"

1115
01:16:27,097 --> 01:16:33,525
"When the heart realizes
the pain of separation"

1116
01:16:33,604 --> 01:16:38,871
"Cloud of tears engulf the eyes"

1117
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:42,068
"The heart has just broken"

1118
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:48,611
"The dreams have just shattered"

1119
01:16:48,752 --> 01:16:51,846
"The shadows have just disappeared"

1120
01:16:51,922 --> 01:16:58,521
"The lines of
destiny have just fallen"

1121
01:17:25,422 --> 01:17:28,516
"Rain fills the eyes"

1122
01:17:28,592 --> 01:17:31,584
"Have the clouds conspired..."

1123
01:17:31,762 --> 01:17:37,462
"Or is this penalty of love?"

1124
01:17:38,068 --> 01:17:41,060
"The desires have dried up"

1125
01:17:41,138 --> 01:17:44,437
"Only pain remains"

1126
01:17:44,641 --> 01:17:50,409
"Nothing's left within me"

1127
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:56,578
"The wind pierces like the glass,
the morning burns like fire"

1128
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:02,122
"This separation tears me apart"

1129
01:18:02,559 --> 01:18:05,119
"The heart has just broken"

1130
01:18:05,629 --> 01:18:11,795
"The dreams have just shattered"

1131
01:18:11,935 --> 01:18:14,904
"The shadows have just disappeared"

1132
01:18:15,338 --> 01:18:22,437
"The lines of
destiny have just fallen"

1133
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:37,720
Have something...

1134
01:18:45,535 --> 01:18:48,868
Neha, I know you are in there

1135
01:18:49,473 --> 01:18:50,565
Neha!

1136
01:18:52,442 --> 01:18:54,000
Come on, please open the door

1137
01:18:55,112 --> 01:18:57,910
I'm not leaving until you talk to me

1138
01:18:58,915 --> 01:19:00,075
Neha!

1139
01:19:02,486 --> 01:19:04,886
Neha never wants to see you again

1140
01:19:05,088 --> 01:19:08,489
No excuse or explanation in
the world can change things

1141
01:19:08,992 --> 01:19:10,118
It's over

1142
01:19:11,928 --> 01:19:13,589
Don't ever come back here again

1143
01:19:27,811 --> 01:19:30,678
I knew you said you'd do
whatever it takes to get what you want...

1144
01:19:30,747 --> 01:19:33,113
...but I never knew
you would fall so low.

1145
01:19:33,383 --> 01:19:34,907
It was mistake, Abhay

1146
01:19:34,985 --> 01:19:38,045
Just like you didn't tell me about
the information Amrita gave you?

1147
01:19:38,755 --> 01:19:41,485
You're still stuck up on that?
- Oh, I forgot

1148
01:19:41,525 --> 01:19:43,493
If you can sell Neha
out for that old hag...

1149
01:19:43,527 --> 01:19:44,994
...who am I to complain, right?

1150
01:19:48,965 --> 01:19:50,091
Rickshaw...

1151
01:19:58,508 --> 01:19:59,873
Leelavati hospital, please

1152
01:20:03,647 --> 01:20:05,706
Madam, is he with you? No
- Yes

1153
01:20:06,716 --> 01:20:08,707
Here. You can have this rickshaw

1154
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:09,843
I'll get another one

1155
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,354
Do you really think I came all
the way here to grab a rickshaw

1156
01:20:12,789 --> 01:20:14,416
Then what are you here for, Rohan?

1157
01:20:14,624 --> 01:20:16,421
We've got nothing left to say!

1158
01:20:16,827 --> 01:20:18,818
I'm trying to
apologize for what I did, Neha

1159
01:20:19,963 --> 01:20:22,056
An apology won't change things

1160
01:20:23,099 --> 01:20:24,691
How long are you going
to go on like this, Neha?

1161
01:20:25,368 --> 01:20:27,427
Can't we just talk
like two mature adults?

1162
01:20:27,737 --> 01:20:30,968
A mature adult is someone who
takes responsibility for his actions

1163
01:20:31,474 --> 01:20:33,465
Something you clearly are not!

1164
01:20:33,777 --> 01:20:36,405
I'm trying to take
responsibility for my actions

1165
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,575
But you won't let me

1166
01:20:38,982 --> 01:20:41,007
Just give me a chance to explain

1167
01:20:41,952 --> 01:20:44,420
Okay, explain this

1168
01:20:45,021 --> 01:20:46,648
Why did you pursue me?

1169
01:20:47,991 --> 01:20:52,087
Why did you initially pursue
me two months back, Rohan?

1170
01:20:52,696 --> 01:20:54,664
Because I liked you, that's why

1171
01:20:56,066 --> 01:20:57,761
Don't lie to me anymore, Rohan

1172
01:20:58,401 --> 01:21:00,062
Abhay told me everything

1173
01:21:00,971 --> 01:21:07,069
You only pursued me because I
was a challenge... a quest...

1174
01:21:07,844 --> 01:21:09,835
Another buckle in your notch!

1175
01:21:10,947 --> 01:21:15,384
And you know what
really hurts the most

1176
01:21:17,053 --> 01:21:21,012
That I actually
thought you cared about me

1177
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:23,485
I actually did

1178
01:21:25,996 --> 01:21:27,327
Okay...

1179
01:21:28,098 --> 01:21:34,662
Initially I did pursue you
because you were a challenge

1180
01:21:35,405 --> 01:21:36,702
But that changed soon after

1181
01:21:37,707 --> 01:21:41,404
I care for you. I care
for you hell of a lot

1182
01:21:42,646 --> 01:21:44,409
Just give me another chance...

1183
01:21:44,748 --> 01:21:46,943
...to show you how much you mean to me

1184
01:21:48,752 --> 01:21:50,913
Another chance is
only given to someone...

1185
01:21:51,655 --> 01:21:53,122
...who truly loves, Rohan

1186
01:21:54,591 --> 01:21:55,922
But no matter what you say,

1187
01:21:57,794 --> 01:21:59,523
you never even cared

1188
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:02,490
You never even cared!

1189
01:22:07,771 --> 01:22:09,898
Now are you going to get out
of this rickshaw or should I?

1190
01:22:20,317 --> 01:22:21,409
Should we leave, madam?

1191
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,549
Yes, let's go

1192
01:22:49,879 --> 01:22:51,039
Forget it, Rohan

1193
01:22:51,748 --> 01:22:52,976
She wasn't worth it

1194
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,450
If she doesn't want to
give you another chance...

1195
01:22:55,518 --> 01:22:57,986
...it's her loss not yours

1196
01:22:58,989 --> 01:23:00,684
You have done more than enough...

1197
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:03,084
...you don't need to go begging again

1198
01:23:05,829 --> 01:23:08,662
Yes. You are right, Vikram

1199
01:23:09,599 --> 01:23:11,362
Now if she wants me
she can come to me!

1200
01:23:14,871 --> 01:23:15,963
Thanks, Vikram

1201
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,732
You are like a brother I never had

1202
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:22,911
I don't know what I'd do
in this city without you!

1203
01:23:23,113 --> 01:23:26,048
Okay, enough with all
this sentimental crap now

1204
01:23:26,082 --> 01:23:28,380
Let's truly celebrate. Come on

1205
01:23:29,619 --> 01:23:31,712
Cheers for becoming
Amrita's new fund manager...

1206
01:23:31,788 --> 01:23:34,951
...and entering the top 10!

1207
01:23:35,025 --> 01:23:36,515
Cheers to that

1208
01:23:38,928 --> 01:23:42,125
But are you sure you're not mad...

1209
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:45,860
...at me for what
happened between me and Amrita?

1210
01:23:46,569 --> 01:23:49,003
Amrita and I are
ancient history, my friend

1211
01:23:49,639 --> 01:23:51,869
She is all yours now

1212
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,640
Evening, ladies.
- Hi.

1213
01:23:55,712 --> 01:23:57,179
You're the man, Vikram

1214
01:23:58,081 --> 01:23:59,412
You're the man!

1215
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:01,449
Who's the man?

1216
01:24:02,152 --> 01:24:04,985
Me. I am the man

1217
01:24:05,855 --> 01:24:08,119
Oh yes, you sure are

1218
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:28,970
I wouldn't get up if I were you!

1219
01:24:30,413 --> 01:24:33,712
You drank so much last night
that you're probably still drunk

1220
01:24:35,518 --> 01:24:37,509
I'll send Isha up
with a hot cup of coffee

1221
01:24:52,902 --> 01:24:55,097
Neha, are you sure
you want to tell them?

1222
01:24:56,773 --> 01:24:59,139
They love me unconditionally, Shivangi

1223
01:25:00,043 --> 01:25:04,173
They'll support me no matter what

1224
01:25:06,015 --> 01:25:10,714
If everyone loved like that,
life would be so much easier

1225
01:25:14,424 --> 01:25:15,914
That's just a false dream, Shivangi

1226
01:25:17,026 --> 01:25:18,687
Life never gets any easier

1227
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:37,444
Amrita...

1228
01:25:39,816 --> 01:25:41,613
...I don't think I
can stay for breakfast

1229
01:25:41,918 --> 01:25:43,749
I've got to go
- Fine...

1230
01:25:44,754 --> 01:25:48,383
...but take this before you go It's
a little something to show you...

1231
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:54,429
...how much I appreciate
all that you've done for me

1232
01:25:54,664 --> 01:25:57,792
Especially all the
profit you made me last week

1233
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:04,497
Ten lakhs!

1234
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:09,572
I... - Don't worry,
just keep it to yourself

1235
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:12,047
No one in the firm needs to know...

1236
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:13,639
...and I won't tell anyone either

1237
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:15,010
It'll be our secret

1238
01:26:17,687 --> 01:26:18,745
Right...

1239
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:22,489
Our secret

1240
01:26:24,861 --> 01:26:28,820
So you're still accompanying me
tonight for the fashion show, right?

1241
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:39,633
Yeah

1242
01:26:41,844 --> 01:26:42,936
Sure

1243
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:44,706
I'll be there

1244
01:26:46,616 --> 01:26:50,677
No, you don't need to come here, Mom

1245
01:26:51,955 --> 01:26:54,389
Right now I just need to sort
everything out in my head first

1246
01:26:59,128 --> 01:27:00,527
I love you too, Mom

1247
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:03,825
I love you too

1248
01:27:04,968 --> 01:27:07,129
I love you and Dad so much

1249
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:09,863
And I'm...

1250
01:27:11,975 --> 01:27:14,068
I'm... really sorry
if I've let you down

1251
01:27:16,646 --> 01:27:17,704
I really am...

1252
01:27:30,059 --> 01:27:31,356
Thank you

1253
01:27:36,666 --> 01:27:37,758
Hey Dad!

1254
01:27:38,067 --> 01:27:40,695
Is working all night a regular
occurrence of yours, as well

1255
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:42,533
The financial world never sleeps, Dad

1256
01:27:42,605 --> 01:27:44,004
Money rotates 24 hours a day

1257
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,007
In your rotating 24 hour a day...

1258
01:27:46,075 --> 01:27:47,508
...were you able to
fix things with Neha?

1259
01:27:47,744 --> 01:27:50,474
Dad, I can handle
things on my own, thanks

1260
01:27:51,147 --> 01:27:52,739
I've heard that before

1261
01:27:53,516 --> 01:27:55,609
Okay, fine... so I messed up

1262
01:27:55,785 --> 01:27:57,047
That's what you want to hear, right?

1263
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,512
You happy now

1264
01:27:59,055 --> 01:28:01,046
Rohan, I am just trying to help you

1265
01:28:01,758 --> 01:28:03,749
If you truly want, you can
still fix things with her

1266
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:05,157
Dad, there's only so much I can do

1267
01:28:05,428 --> 01:28:07,123
If she doesn't want to
give me another chance...

1268
01:28:07,397 --> 01:28:08,762
...I'm not going to
keep begging her to do so!

1269
01:28:08,865 --> 01:28:10,492
Don't let your ego
get in the way, Rohan

1270
01:28:11,401 --> 01:28:13,926
If you love her you'll do
whatever it takes to get her back

1271
01:28:14,003 --> 01:28:15,903
Even if that means begging her for
forgiveness until the end of time

1272
01:28:16,072 --> 01:28:18,006
Dad, can we just drop it

1273
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:19,668
Vikram's waiting for us

1274
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:27,916
I still don't get why this
Vikram wants to have lunch with me?

1275
01:28:27,984 --> 01:28:30,384
Dad, like I said,
he's just a friend...

1276
01:28:30,453 --> 01:28:33,547
...who's being hospitable, that's all

1277
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,585
Sir, I heard that...

1278
01:28:39,896 --> 01:28:42,956
...the Army is out looking
for a new ammunition supplier

1279
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:46,664
And this time... an Indian company?

1280
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:50,061
Yes, you heard correctly

1281
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:53,634
Any idea who seems like a sure bet

1282
01:29:01,517 --> 01:29:03,144
Even if I knew Vikram...

1283
01:29:04,954 --> 01:29:06,148
...I wouldn't tell you

1284
01:29:15,965 --> 01:29:17,023
Taxi!

1285
01:29:18,568 --> 01:29:20,092
He didn't meet me to say hello

1286
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:21,997
He met me to try and get
some information out of me

1287
01:29:22,438 --> 01:29:23,905
Dad, I didn't even
tell him until today...

1288
01:29:24,507 --> 01:29:25,974
...that you were a
brigadier in the army

1289
01:29:26,442 --> 01:29:27,568
He had no idea

1290
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:29,402
Don't be so naA-ve, Rohan

1291
01:29:29,445 --> 01:29:30,810
It seems like he had
it all figured out

1292
01:29:31,013 --> 01:29:32,810
Dad, don't slander his
reputation for no rhyme or reason

1293
01:29:32,982 --> 01:29:34,950
What would I gain by
slandering him, Rohan?

1294
01:29:35,685 --> 01:29:37,550
I want the best for you...

1295
01:29:37,854 --> 01:29:39,879
...but when something's not right,
it's just not right!

1296
01:29:40,456 --> 01:29:42,390
You don't want what's best for me, Dad

1297
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,517
You only want what's
best for yourself!

1298
01:29:44,594 --> 01:29:46,357
If you wanted the best for me
then you would've helped me out...

1299
01:29:46,429 --> 01:29:48,522
...when I asked you to before!

1300
01:29:48,598 --> 01:29:50,088
If you asked me to
help you on something...

1301
01:29:50,366 --> 01:29:51,697
...that was right I would've
put my right arm forward...

1302
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:53,834
...but what you were
doing was wrong...

1303
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:56,029
If I had pursued the
career you wanted me to...

1304
01:29:56,406 --> 01:29:57,873
...and asked you for help,
you would've helped me...

1305
01:29:58,107 --> 01:30:00,405
...regardless if it was right or wrong

1306
01:30:03,379 --> 01:30:06,007
If that's the way you
see it, I'll say no more

1307
01:30:07,383 --> 01:30:08,611
Wish you all the best my son

1308
01:30:09,852 --> 01:30:12,082
May you succeed in
every decision you make

1309
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,592
I will do it, sir

1310
01:30:25,668 --> 01:30:26,965
Definitely, yes sir

1311
01:30:30,072 --> 01:30:31,334
No, no sir

1312
01:30:33,009 --> 01:30:35,637
Why thank me. That's our job

1313
01:30:36,446 --> 01:30:37,743
Yes, sir

1314
01:30:40,483 --> 01:30:41,882
Absolutely... no, no, sir

1315
01:30:45,655 --> 01:30:47,555
Sure sir, I will
transfer it tomorrow, sir

1316
01:30:48,858 --> 01:30:49,916
Yes...

1317
01:30:51,427 --> 01:30:54,396
Sir, I will call you in a while, sir

1318
01:31:28,464 --> 01:31:30,955
Abhay, this is for you It's a
gift from my first big commission

1319
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:32,961
I want you to have it

1320
01:31:36,038 --> 01:31:37,096
Okay, fine

1321
01:31:38,007 --> 01:31:40,942
I'm just leaving it right here,
take it when you're done

1322
01:31:41,344 --> 01:31:44,973
I took the picture because
it's of a friend I once knew...

1323
01:31:45,515 --> 01:31:48,609
...but I won't take the frame
because it's from someone...

1324
01:31:48,885 --> 01:31:50,512
...I don't know anymore

1325
01:31:50,786 --> 01:31:52,048
Okay fine, Abhay

1326
01:31:52,755 --> 01:31:54,484
I am sorry. It won't happen again

1327
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:57,122
Next time Amrita gives
me any information...

1328
01:31:57,393 --> 01:31:58,485
...I'll let you know

1329
01:31:58,561 --> 01:31:59,960
It's not about that anymore, Rohan

1330
01:32:00,429 --> 01:32:04,923
It's about the trust and I don't
know if I can trust you anymore

1331
01:32:05,368 --> 01:32:06,926
You're telling me about trust?

1332
01:32:07,637 --> 01:32:08,934
When you're the one who told Neha...

1333
01:32:09,005 --> 01:32:10,700
...my initial reasons for pursuing her

1334
01:32:11,507 --> 01:32:12,872
You never really cared
for her anyway, Rohan

1335
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:14,934
So why does it matter?

1336
01:32:15,444 --> 01:32:18,936
She was just time pass
until the next one came along

1337
01:32:19,382 --> 01:32:20,940
It was a mistake, Abhay

1338
01:32:21,651 --> 01:32:23,346
It was a bloody mistake

1339
01:32:23,419 --> 01:32:25,683
We're humans, we make mistakes

1340
01:32:26,389 --> 01:32:28,550
And just because I never got
around saying 'I love you' to her...

1341
01:32:28,858 --> 01:32:31,349
Abhay, that doesn't mean
she was just time pass

1342
01:32:32,328 --> 01:32:33,852
I care for her

1343
01:32:34,931 --> 01:32:36,831
I care for her a hell of a lot

1344
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,391
Well you're not showing
her that now, are you?

1345
01:32:39,702 --> 01:32:41,329
There's only so much I can do, Abhay

1346
01:32:42,505 --> 01:32:45,030
I can't keep rubbing my
nose in the dirt everyday...

1347
01:32:45,641 --> 01:32:47,108
...only to have it
trampled on each time

1348
01:32:48,678 --> 01:32:52,705
You know Rohan, Vikram has
everything money can buy...

1349
01:32:53,015 --> 01:32:57,452
...but no one to call
his own, why's that?

1350
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:01,012
Because he doesn't think of
anyone else other than himself

1351
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:04,622
now I know what you two have in common

1352
01:33:07,964 --> 01:33:09,397
Thanks for the picture

1353
01:33:09,465 --> 01:33:12,593
I'll look at it and
remember the Rohan I once knew

1354
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:21,075
Splash color. Have fun.

1355
01:33:21,143 --> 01:33:23,703
Look good.

1356
01:33:26,015 --> 01:33:27,812
Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God

1357
01:33:27,883 --> 01:33:30,408
What? What is it? What happened?
- Look.

1358
01:33:30,653 --> 01:33:32,621
Oh my God, My commercial

1359
01:33:33,055 --> 01:33:34,113
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1360
01:33:34,457 --> 01:33:35,583
This is so cool.

1361
01:33:36,092 --> 01:33:40,495
Okay you call and tell
Abhay and I'll call Rohan

1362
01:33:43,966 --> 01:33:45,024
I mean

1363
01:33:48,104 --> 01:33:51,699
you call Abhay and
I'll call my parents

1364
01:33:53,609 --> 01:33:57,807
Neha, you should delete
his number from your phone

1365
01:34:01,183 --> 01:34:04,880
Yeah... I should...

1366
01:34:08,424 --> 01:34:10,483
The all new shadow power.

1367
01:34:10,693 --> 01:34:12,627
Look, your dividend

1368
01:34:13,129 --> 01:34:16,030
Dreamy, radiant, lovable, Forever 20.

1369
01:34:16,499 --> 01:34:18,558
Looks like she finally made it

1370
01:34:19,101 --> 01:34:20,568
Looking good

1371
01:34:42,858 --> 01:34:45,793
"The days are Ionely"

1372
01:34:46,028 --> 01:34:48,997
"How do I live this moment"

1373
01:34:49,398 --> 01:34:54,665
"When time is against me"

1374
01:34:55,671 --> 01:35:01,769
"What is left, everything is gone"

1375
01:35:02,044 --> 01:35:07,448
"The path is completely dark"

1376
01:35:07,817 --> 01:35:13,949
"The breath flickers,
every joy is stifled"

1377
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:19,589
"The entire world is drowned in pain"

1378
01:35:19,862 --> 01:35:22,854
"The heart has just broken"

1379
01:35:23,032 --> 01:35:28,902
"The dreams have just shattered"

1380
01:35:29,538 --> 01:35:32,564
"The shadows have just disappeared"

1381
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:39,136
"The lines of
destiny have just fallen"

1382
01:36:22,858 --> 01:36:25,827
Neha, you've got the
biggest movie director...

1383
01:36:25,895 --> 01:36:27,487
...of the country chasing you

1384
01:36:27,863 --> 01:36:30,798
Anyone would give an arm and leg
to be in your shoes, right now

1385
01:36:32,802 --> 01:36:34,770
Yeah, may be this
wasn't meant for me...

1386
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:44,108
Well you don't need to
tell any reporter...

1387
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,847
...you're still contemplating this

1388
01:36:45,915 --> 01:36:48,440
Here, let me answer that and
tell them you're just busy right now

1389
01:36:49,518 --> 01:36:52,612
It's not a reporter, Shivangi,
its Rohan

1390
01:36:53,455 --> 01:36:54,752
This is his number

1391
01:36:55,624 --> 01:36:56,818
What a jerk!

1392
01:36:57,393 --> 01:36:59,520
I can't believe he's calling you

1393
01:36:59,995 --> 01:37:02,429
Typical! Now that you're famous...

1394
01:37:02,498 --> 01:37:04,090
...he'll probably do
anything to have you back

1395
01:37:06,836 --> 01:37:09,430
You don't need to answer it, Neha

1396
01:37:10,072 --> 01:37:11,596
I know, Shivangi

1397
01:37:11,941 --> 01:37:14,967
I'm just putting it
on silent, that's all

1398
01:37:33,062 --> 01:37:34,427
Wise stock choice, Abhay

1399
01:37:34,496 --> 01:37:36,396
Companies that have their
fundamentals in order...

1400
01:37:36,465 --> 01:37:37,830
...always get rewarded

1401
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:40,061
And I hear this is only the
first phase of this ammunition deal

1402
01:37:40,135 --> 01:37:41,397
Thanks, Jatin sir

1403
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:44,439
Just followed your advice,
stuck to the fundamentals

1404
01:37:44,807 --> 01:37:47,833
I'm sure the profits you are
going to make for your clients...

1405
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:49,434
...from this deal will
be enough for you...

1406
01:37:49,478 --> 01:37:51,378
...to get into the top 10

1407
01:37:57,486 --> 01:37:58,714
You got clients into Bharat Steel...

1408
01:37:58,787 --> 01:38:01,415
India's next ammunition giant?

1409
01:38:01,857 --> 01:38:04,826
Yeah, and I hear Vikram did too

1410
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:06,895
How come he never
told you about this one?

1411
01:38:08,464 --> 01:38:09,931
Hello, yes ma'am

1412
01:38:10,532 --> 01:38:12,693
For sure, I will do that

1413
01:38:13,802 --> 01:38:17,932
Vikram, why didn't you tell me
about the Bharat Steel deal?

1414
01:38:18,474 --> 01:38:20,499
You know how it is

1415
01:38:21,043 --> 01:38:23,409
I didn't want the word to leak

1416
01:38:23,979 --> 01:38:26,470
Maybe next time there's
something I'll let you know

1417
01:38:27,116 --> 01:38:28,981
Anyway, catch you later...
I've got to go

1418
01:38:38,727 --> 01:38:41,423
And?
- Yes, I do

1419
01:38:50,673 --> 01:38:51,765
Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1420
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,898
Hello...

1421
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:56,706
Happy Birthday, Abhay
- Thanks, Rohan

1422
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:00,107
I bet you didn't
expect me to call, did you?

1423
01:39:00,916 --> 01:39:03,612
Honestly... no, I didn't...

1424
01:39:04,386 --> 01:39:06,081
Hope I'm not interrupting anything

1425
01:39:06,922 --> 01:39:09,948
Actually I was just...

1426
01:39:10,025 --> 01:39:11,492
Right...

1427
01:39:12,561 --> 01:39:13,823
Of course...

1428
01:39:15,798 --> 01:39:17,732
You must be celebrating your birthday

1429
01:39:18,434 --> 01:39:21,665
Yes, actually I was...

1430
01:39:22,371 --> 01:39:26,000
Is Neha there with you?

1431
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:30,438
Yes, she is

1432
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:33,111
How is she, Abhay?

1433
01:39:33,882 --> 01:39:37,374
Actually Rohan, I really need to go

1434
01:39:38,387 --> 01:39:39,581
But thanks

1435
01:39:40,723 --> 01:39:41,985
Thanks for calling

1436
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:43,783
Hey...

1437
01:39:45,761 --> 01:39:49,561
do you think we can catch
up tomorrow for a drink?

1438
01:39:51,633 --> 01:39:52,759
Yes...

1439
01:39:53,936 --> 01:39:54,994
Sure...

1440
01:39:55,637 --> 01:39:57,104
Thanks, Abhay

1441
01:39:58,007 --> 01:39:59,668
I really appreciate this

1442
01:40:01,543 --> 01:40:02,635
See you tomorrow?

1443
01:40:03,412 --> 01:40:05,846
Okay... see you

1444
01:40:10,586 --> 01:40:13,680
Hey... he called me, I didn't

1445
01:40:13,856 --> 01:40:17,383
Well, you didn't have to pick it up

1446
01:40:17,726 --> 01:40:20,718
It's okay Shivangi, everyone
has a right to wish him...

1447
01:40:20,763 --> 01:40:22,731
...on his birthday

1448
01:40:23,699 --> 01:40:26,327
Congratulations, Abhay
- Thank you

1449
01:40:26,402 --> 01:40:28,529
I am really happy for you
- Thank you

1450
01:40:28,604 --> 01:40:30,538
Hey, I want in on this hug too!

1451
01:40:38,714 --> 01:40:41,376
Shivangi and I are getting engaged

1452
01:40:41,683 --> 01:40:42,843
Our engagement is on Sunday

1453
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:45,951
A few of the guys from
college will also be there

1454
01:40:46,388 --> 01:40:47,582
You can come if you want

1455
01:40:47,856 --> 01:40:49,016
Wow!

1456
01:40:50,659 --> 01:40:52,422
I don't know what to say, Abhay

1457
01:40:53,762 --> 01:40:55,559
You are getting engaged

1458
01:40:56,698 --> 01:40:59,929
Wow, that's amazing

1459
01:41:00,636 --> 01:41:03,935
Yeah, and I'll be moving out
at the end of the month as well

1460
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:06,832
After the engagement,
Shivangi and I...

1461
01:41:06,909 --> 01:41:08,035
...will be moving in together

1462
01:41:08,544 --> 01:41:09,636
What?

1463
01:41:10,546 --> 01:41:11,911
Why? What about Neha?

1464
01:41:12,047 --> 01:41:13,412
Where's she going to stay?

1465
01:41:16,552 --> 01:41:20,921
Actually Neha's the one who
helped us arrive on this decision

1466
01:41:21,390 --> 01:41:23,381
She is moving back to Delhi...

1467
01:41:24,059 --> 01:41:26,550
...so Shivangi and I
decided to move in together...

1468
01:41:27,696 --> 01:41:30,927
...so we can start
saving for our future

1469
01:41:32,468 --> 01:41:33,799
She's moving back?

1470
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:35,730
Why?

1471
01:41:36,371 --> 01:41:38,396
What about her career?

1472
01:41:38,807 --> 01:41:40,832
Everything's just going
perfect for her right now!

1473
01:41:42,544 --> 01:41:44,705
Not all dreams work out, Rohan

1474
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:47,414
Sometimes you don't get what you want

1475
01:42:11,974 --> 01:42:13,771
"You shine like the stars"

1476
01:42:13,842 --> 01:42:15,605
"You glow like the moon"

1477
01:42:15,677 --> 01:42:19,306
"My eyes just watch you mesmerized"

1478
01:42:19,381 --> 01:42:20,905
"When your earrings dangle"

1479
01:42:20,983 --> 01:42:22,848
"When your body sways"

1480
01:42:22,918 --> 01:42:24,715
"Entire world says"

1481
01:42:24,753 --> 01:42:26,687
"Sway one more time"

1482
01:42:26,755 --> 01:42:27,983
"Baby, baby, baby"

1483
01:42:28,056 --> 01:42:31,719
"Give me one more,
one more shimmey shake"

1484
01:42:31,793 --> 01:42:35,490
"Baby, one more one
more flutter of your eyes"

1485
01:42:35,531 --> 01:42:38,932
"Give me one more,
one more shimmey shake"

1486
01:42:39,001 --> 01:42:42,596
"Baby, one more one
more flutter of your eyes"

1487
01:42:43,071 --> 01:42:46,768
My shimmey shake
steals everyone's hearts

1488
01:42:46,842 --> 01:42:50,369
"Everyone wants my shimmey shake"

1489
01:42:50,445 --> 01:42:53,937
"My eye fluttering
charms everyone's hearts"

1490
01:42:54,016 --> 01:42:57,645
"Everyone wants my fluttering eyes"

1491
01:43:15,604 --> 01:43:19,040
"When your bangles jingle"

1492
01:43:19,107 --> 01:43:22,474
"I feel alive again"

1493
01:43:22,811 --> 01:43:26,076
"I get restless"

1494
01:43:26,415 --> 01:43:29,851
"When your anklets tinkle"

1495
01:43:30,118 --> 01:43:37,047
"Hold my hand... and
come forward and dance

1496
01:43:37,426 --> 01:43:44,525
"O hold my hand... and
come forward and dance"

1497
01:43:44,733 --> 01:43:48,794
"I have lost my heart to you"

1498
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:50,098
"Baby, baby, baby"

1499
01:43:50,172 --> 01:43:53,801
"Give me one more,
one more shimmey shake"

1500
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:57,538
"Baby, one more one
more flutter of your eyes"

1501
01:43:57,613 --> 01:44:01,014
"Give me one more,
one more shimmey shake"

1502
01:44:01,083 --> 01:44:04,951
"Baby, one more one
more flutter of your eyes"

1503
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:08,717
Your shimmey shake
steals everyone's hearts

1504
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:12,123
Everyone wants your shimmey shake

1505
01:44:12,394 --> 01:44:15,921
Your eye flutter
charms everyone's hearts

1506
01:44:15,998 --> 01:44:19,934
Everyone wants your fluttering eyes

1507
01:44:33,715 --> 01:44:37,481
"My eyes say to you"

1508
01:44:37,619 --> 01:44:40,816
"Forget the world and be mine"

1509
01:44:41,023 --> 01:44:44,686
"My life, my sweetheart"

1510
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:48,421
"Equates you to God"

1511
01:44:48,463 --> 01:44:54,959
"All day, all night on your forehead"

1512
01:44:55,737 --> 01:45:02,506
"All day, all night on your forehead"

1513
01:45:02,911 --> 01:45:06,574
"I'll shine like a beaming star"

1514
01:45:06,982 --> 01:45:08,472
"Baby, baby, baby"

1515
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,917
"Give me one more,
one more shimmey shake"

1516
01:45:11,987 --> 01:45:15,616
"Baby, one more one
more flutter of your eyes"

1517
01:45:15,691 --> 01:45:19,354
"Give me one more,
one more shimmey shake"

1518
01:45:19,428 --> 01:45:22,829
"Baby, one more one
more flutter of your eyes"

1519
01:45:22,898 --> 01:45:26,527
"Give me one more,
one more shimmey shake"

1520
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:30,059
"Baby, one more one
more flutter of your eyes"

1521
01:45:30,138 --> 01:45:33,801
"Give me one more,
one more shimmey shake"

1522
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:38,039
"Baby, one more one
more flutter of your eyes"

1523
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,684
Hi

1524
01:45:54,696 --> 01:45:55,788
You're looking good

1525
01:45:57,499 --> 01:45:58,625
I try

1526
01:46:00,001 --> 01:46:01,559
It's nice to see you again

1527
01:46:02,437 --> 01:46:04,064
I wish I could say the same to you

1528
01:46:04,606 --> 01:46:06,403
I hear you're moving back home?

1529
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:08,133
That's none of your business

1530
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:09,900
Acting meant the world to you, Neha

1531
01:46:10,045 --> 01:46:11,512
Why are you throwing it all away...

1532
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:12,808
...just when
everything's going right for you?

1533
01:46:12,881 --> 01:46:16,476
Look, whatever you're going
to say I don't want to hear it

1534
01:46:16,818 --> 01:46:19,844
Let's just enjoy the party
like two mature adults, okay

1535
01:46:20,021 --> 01:46:21,511
Neha, I love you!

1536
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:24,618
You're the first girl I've
ever fallen in love with...

1537
01:46:24,826 --> 01:46:26,521
...and you'll be the last
because I won't ever feel...

1538
01:46:26,661 --> 01:46:31,689
...the way I do about
you with anybody else

1539
01:46:32,067 --> 01:46:34,729
Yes, I made a horrible mistake

1540
01:46:34,903 --> 01:46:36,029
But trust me when I say this

1541
01:46:36,138 --> 01:46:38,698
I really don't know what
happened that night with Amrita

1542
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:40,464
I really don't

1543
01:46:40,809 --> 01:46:42,902
Don't start this, Rohan... don't...

1544
01:46:42,978 --> 01:46:45,708
And yes, I pursued you
aggressively because...

1545
01:46:45,781 --> 01:46:48,716
...you were a
challenge but if I didn't...

1546
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:50,076
...you would never
have given me a chance...

1547
01:46:50,152 --> 01:46:51,779
...to enter your life
and I would never have...

1548
01:46:51,853 --> 01:46:55,448
...gotten the chance
to fall in love with you

1549
01:46:56,658 --> 01:46:59,650
You can't do this now Rohan,
you just can't!

1550
01:46:59,928 --> 01:47:04,126
Once you left me Neha, my
world went completely dark...

1551
01:47:04,499 --> 01:47:08,162
...and I did things I am not proud of

1552
01:47:09,037 --> 01:47:10,834
You were the fireworks
that lit up my sky, Neha

1553
01:47:11,173 --> 01:47:15,542
You're the one I want to
spend the rest of my life with

1554
01:47:16,077 --> 01:47:22,073
Can you forgive my
intentional and unintentional mistakes?

1555
01:47:22,651 --> 01:47:25,586
If you seriously want
me to talk, Rohan...

1556
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:27,918
...then get up now or I'm leaving

1557
01:47:29,357 --> 01:47:30,949
You just can't do this, Rohan

1558
01:47:31,059 --> 01:47:33,857
You just can't ruin
someone else's moment of joy!

1559
01:47:33,962 --> 01:47:35,657
No, that wasn't my...

1560
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:38,597
The only person you love,
Rohan, is yourself

1561
01:47:38,934 --> 01:47:40,868
And you're only doing this because...

1562
01:47:40,936 --> 01:47:44,599
...you can't handle the
guilt of what you did to me.

1563
01:47:46,041 --> 01:47:49,841
The day you love me more
than yourself, Rohan...

1564
01:47:50,378 --> 01:47:53,643
...I'll know, I'll feel it

1565
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:56,540
But today sure isn't that day

1566
01:47:56,918 --> 01:47:58,681
Neha, I am not perfect

1567
01:47:58,887 --> 01:48:03,551
I'm just a human being,
asking her to forgive him...

1568
01:48:04,125 --> 01:48:06,889
...the only what he knows

1569
01:48:13,802 --> 01:48:15,360
I'm pregnant, Rohan

1570
01:48:16,805 --> 01:48:20,400
But don't worry, I don't
want anything from you

1571
01:48:21,443 --> 01:48:23,877
This child is mine and mine only

1572
01:48:25,013 --> 01:48:29,473
You've lost the right to
be a part of the life...

1573
01:48:30,385 --> 01:48:32,012
...I choose for me and my child

1574
01:49:22,737 --> 01:49:24,466
I think we've been
friends long enough...

1575
01:49:24,673 --> 01:49:26,607
...for you to at least
give me a heads up, Abhay

1576
01:49:26,641 --> 01:49:28,074
She needed to tell you herself

1577
01:49:28,343 --> 01:49:29,742
So she could shock me

1578
01:49:29,811 --> 01:49:31,108
Okay, guys...

1579
01:49:31,746 --> 01:49:33,509
Five days to go...

1580
01:49:33,648 --> 01:49:35,513
Don't stop those engines just yet

1581
01:49:35,584 --> 01:49:36,676
Anything can still happen

1582
01:49:36,818 --> 01:49:38,945
But Akash surely looks
like a lock for the top spot

1583
01:49:39,621 --> 01:49:40,747
Thank you, sir

1584
01:49:42,757 --> 01:49:45,021
What was the point in
pimping yourself out...

1585
01:49:45,894 --> 01:49:47,555
...if you couldn't
even make it to the top?

1586
01:49:49,798 --> 01:49:51,356
How pathetic!

1587
01:50:02,777 --> 01:50:05,007
Amrita, I need to
shift your portfolio...

1588
01:50:05,947 --> 01:50:07,380
...and purchase the following stocks

1589
01:50:07,549 --> 01:50:09,107
And I need some more money

1590
01:50:11,086 --> 01:50:14,749
It's only for a few days
and then I'll switch you back

1591
01:50:15,724 --> 01:50:17,089
I just need to make a
few big transactions...

1592
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:18,792
...so I can reach the top

1593
01:50:19,327 --> 01:50:21,352
Rohan, you've already
got a place in the firm...

1594
01:50:21,796 --> 01:50:23,889
...so why this need to reach the top?

1595
01:50:25,967 --> 01:50:28,800
If it's the cheap car and apartment...

1596
01:50:28,903 --> 01:50:30,029
...you're after then don't worry

1597
01:50:30,071 --> 01:50:31,561
I'll get you a
better car and apartment

1598
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:32,698
No, it's just that I...

1599
01:50:32,774 --> 01:50:33,900
And anyway I've already reached...

1600
01:50:33,975 --> 01:50:35,806
...my current investment limit

1601
01:50:36,378 --> 01:50:38,505
...so regardless I
can't help you right now

1602
01:50:48,857 --> 01:50:52,554
Jatin, how many transactions do
I need to make to get to the top?

1603
01:50:52,894 --> 01:50:54,885
You're going to need a miracle

1604
01:51:00,468 --> 01:51:01,799
Jatin, are these today's trades?

1605
01:51:01,936 --> 01:51:03,927
Yes, just came in ten minutes ago

1606
01:51:06,741 --> 01:51:09,938
Amrita invested one
crore today through Vikram

1607
01:51:10,412 --> 01:51:11,470
Yes.

1608
01:51:40,942 --> 01:51:45,402
Hey, you promised me no tears

1609
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:48,049
Let me have my moment

1610
01:51:48,516 --> 01:51:51,383
It's not often that someone
can evoke some emotion from me

1611
01:51:52,687 --> 01:51:54,655
You must really be special

1612
01:51:55,824 --> 01:51:57,655
Thanks, Shivangi

1613
01:51:57,959 --> 01:52:00,086
You are special to me too

1614
01:52:01,429 --> 01:52:03,090
Thanks for being on
my side throughout...

1615
01:52:04,032 --> 01:52:06,694
...I don't know how I
would have coped without you

1616
01:52:09,504 --> 01:52:14,066
Whatever you do Neha, it's
going to be the best decision

1617
01:52:16,344 --> 01:52:18,869
Because it'll be a
decision made by your heart

1618
01:52:44,906 --> 01:52:46,806
Gosh!

1619
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:48,838
Rohan, you scared me

1620
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:50,639
Why are you sitting in the dark?

1621
01:52:54,682 --> 01:52:56,809
A new fresher every year, Amrita

1622
01:52:57,085 --> 01:52:59,713
I am just another guy in your list

1623
01:52:59,921 --> 01:53:02,947
Another guy whom you bed every year

1624
01:53:06,728 --> 01:53:10,459
It's not what you think

1625
01:53:15,036 --> 01:53:17,766
I never had what I
have with you with others!

1626
01:53:17,839 --> 01:53:18,897
Really...

1627
01:53:18,973 --> 01:53:20,497
What we have is special

1628
01:53:20,575 --> 01:53:22,736
Then why did you lie to me?

1629
01:53:23,444 --> 01:53:26,436
Why did you say that you have
crossed your investment limit...

1630
01:53:26,514 --> 01:53:28,914
...when you gave one
crore to Vikram today

1631
01:53:30,819 --> 01:53:34,550
I... had discussed that
with Vikram months ago

1632
01:53:34,622 --> 01:53:36,749
It just got
processed today, that's all

1633
01:53:36,891 --> 01:53:39,985
You know, Rohan, I
would have invested more...

1634
01:53:40,128 --> 01:53:42,096
...through you if it was possible

1635
01:53:42,163 --> 01:53:43,960
You know that.
- Don't.

1636
01:53:45,033 --> 01:53:47,467
I don't know what to believe, Amrita

1637
01:53:48,636 --> 01:53:50,069
I don't know what to believe.

1638
01:54:03,518 --> 01:54:05,679
Vikram, are you sure
he doesn't know anything

1639
01:54:05,753 --> 01:54:06,981
Amrita, have I ever given
you a reason to doubt me...

1640
01:54:07,055 --> 01:54:08,579
...in 15 years

1641
01:54:09,924 --> 01:54:14,725
Amrita, I make you millions
and get people to please you...

1642
01:54:14,796 --> 01:54:16,627
...and you are doubting me?

1643
01:54:16,764 --> 01:54:18,789
I'm sorry, I was just a little tense

1644
01:54:18,867 --> 01:54:21,028
Relax, have faith

1645
01:54:21,502 --> 01:54:24,699
He doesn't know that I set
him up to please you so that...

1646
01:54:24,772 --> 01:54:26,797
...you continue
investing your crores through me

1647
01:54:28,142 --> 01:54:31,600
I'll talk to him in the morning,
you have a drink...

1648
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,044
...and go to sleep

1649
01:54:33,114 --> 01:54:35,105
Fine, you know best

1650
01:54:35,783 --> 01:54:37,148
Goodnight and thanks

1651
01:54:37,719 --> 01:54:38,947
Goodnight

1652
01:54:47,729 --> 01:54:48,855
Oh

1653
01:54:52,667 --> 01:54:53,827
You're back

1654
01:54:58,473 --> 01:55:02,409
Come, let me massage your head...

1655
01:55:02,810 --> 01:55:04,505
It'll calm you down

1656
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:07,807
You could have asked me Amrita

1657
01:55:09,017 --> 01:55:11,178
You didn't need to play this game

1658
01:55:13,655 --> 01:55:15,020
What are you talking about?

1659
01:55:15,556 --> 01:55:17,490
You don't need to
pretend anymore, Amrita

1660
01:55:17,759 --> 01:55:19,818
I heard your conversation

1661
01:55:20,862 --> 01:55:23,387
I've always heard about
high society whores...

1662
01:55:23,665 --> 01:55:25,098
...now I have seen one in person!

1663
01:55:26,968 --> 01:55:28,060
How dare you?

1664
01:55:28,836 --> 01:55:30,770
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

1665
01:55:31,072 --> 01:55:32,767
Imagine what I'm feeling right now...

1666
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:35,673
...knowing that I
was used like a hustler

1667
01:55:37,478 --> 01:55:39,503
You make me sick, Amrita

1668
01:55:39,681 --> 01:55:41,649
May you rot in your sickness!

1669
01:55:51,492 --> 01:55:54,484
Your attention please.

1670
01:55:54,896 --> 01:55:58,593
We are sorry to inform you that
flight no.9W351Mumbai-Delhi is...

1671
01:55:58,666 --> 01:55:59,894
...delayed by one hour.

1672
01:56:00,401 --> 01:56:03,666
We regret the
inconvenience caused. Thank you.

1673
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:21,518
These are my team's
first quarter results

1674
01:56:21,589 --> 01:56:23,489
Why, Vikram? Why?

1675
01:56:24,625 --> 01:56:27,423
Rohan, now's not a good time... later

1676
01:56:27,862 --> 01:56:31,662
I can't wait later!
I need answers now, Vikram

1677
01:56:33,534 --> 01:56:35,798
Excuse me, I'll just be one second

1678
01:56:41,009 --> 01:56:44,843
Okay stop overreacting, calm down

1679
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:46,572
Relax

1680
01:56:47,715 --> 01:56:50,149
Go get some sleep and we'll talk later

1681
01:56:50,418 --> 01:56:51,715
I've done enough relaxing, Vikram

1682
01:56:52,153 --> 01:56:53,620
Now I just want answers

1683
01:56:53,688 --> 01:56:56,521
Just tell me why, Vikram? Why?

1684
01:56:56,958 --> 01:56:59,051
Don't get mouthy with me, kid

1685
01:56:59,894 --> 01:57:03,728
I got you into the top 10,
I can very well get you out

1686
01:57:03,765 --> 01:57:06,131
I don't give a damn about
your top 10 anymore, Vikram

1687
01:57:06,768 --> 01:57:08,497
Your top 10 can go to hell

1688
01:57:08,669 --> 01:57:11,695
I want a reason,
I want a reason God damn it

1689
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:13,805
You want a reason?

1690
01:57:13,875 --> 01:57:15,342
Yes, I want a reason

1691
01:57:15,543 --> 01:57:18,979
Because you were usable and
because I could, that's why

1692
01:57:19,914 --> 01:57:21,006
That's it

1693
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:24,011
Because you could?

1694
01:57:24,452 --> 01:57:27,546
Yes, that's
it... nothing more, nothing less

1695
01:57:27,955 --> 01:57:30,651
Now don't waste my time again!

1696
01:57:31,993 --> 01:57:35,793
Security, take this good for
nothing trash out of here...

1697
01:57:35,863 --> 01:57:38,593
...and show him where he belongs

1698
01:57:45,706 --> 01:57:50,769
The number 1 rule of
investing is to know its data...

1699
01:57:51,579 --> 01:57:52,807
...but, Rohan, you
invested in Vikram...

1700
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,609
...without even researching his data

1701
01:57:55,049 --> 01:57:57,108
You had potential, kid

1702
01:57:57,418 --> 01:58:01,047
You were good but just not good enough

1703
01:58:41,896 --> 01:58:44,956
Told you to watch
your back, pretty boy

1704
01:58:47,535 --> 01:58:48,729
But you don't listen, do you?

1705
01:59:50,865 --> 01:59:52,093
What happened?

1706
01:59:52,867 --> 01:59:54,027
I'm not dead yet

1707
01:59:54,635 --> 01:59:55,693
I'm still alive, Rohan

1708
01:59:56,637 --> 01:59:58,502
I'm just glad to see you, Dad

1709
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,637
I am just glad to see you

1710
02:00:05,046 --> 02:00:06,707
I'm glad to see you too, son

1711
02:00:07,481 --> 02:00:08,812
I'm glad to see you too

1712
02:00:22,063 --> 02:00:25,794
Dad, that's the same
tree you planted...

1713
02:00:26,434 --> 02:00:28,698
...when Mom passed away, right

1714
02:00:31,739 --> 02:00:33,001
Yes

1715
02:00:34,942 --> 02:00:36,341
It's grown so much

1716
02:00:37,878 --> 02:00:44,613
It grows stronger everyday
just like my love for her

1717
02:00:51,659 --> 02:00:53,092
I'm sorry for everything, Dad

1718
02:00:54,829 --> 02:00:56,387
I really am

1719
02:00:58,132 --> 02:01:00,896
I messed up with a lot of people...

1720
02:01:01,636 --> 02:01:03,467
...but I messed up the most with you

1721
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:08,734
I'm sorry for not
letting you into my life

1722
02:01:10,578 --> 02:01:12,876
I am sorry for not taking your advice

1723
02:01:15,616 --> 02:01:20,553
And I'm sorry for
blaming you for Mom's death

1724
02:01:27,061 --> 02:01:29,757
If you don't forgive me, I understand

1725
02:01:31,532 --> 02:01:33,591
But I just want you to know that...

1726
02:01:37,038 --> 02:01:41,532
I love you a lot

1727
02:01:46,681 --> 02:01:49,844
I love you too,
son... I love you too...

1728
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:18,708
So I was a fool and I
understand if you...

1729
02:02:19,847 --> 02:02:22,782
...don't forgive me

1730
02:02:23,584 --> 02:02:26,951
But still, I wanted to
say sorry and apologise...

1731
02:02:27,755 --> 02:02:29,484
...from the bottom of my heart

1732
02:02:30,858 --> 02:02:33,725
Actually, I need to thank you

1733
02:02:33,861 --> 02:02:36,352
If all that hadn't
happened between you and Vikram...

1734
02:02:36,464 --> 02:02:38,091
...then I would never
have made it to top 10

1735
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:40,765
What? You made it?

1736
02:02:41,102 --> 02:02:44,333
Yes, I was number 11 and
when you got kicked out...

1737
02:02:44,405 --> 02:02:45,599
...I made it to the top 10

1738
02:02:45,673 --> 02:02:48,904
Wow, congratulations, Abhay

1739
02:02:49,343 --> 02:02:50,776
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1740
02:02:51,379 --> 02:02:53,813
I wanted to see you
beg and say sorry...

1741
02:02:53,881 --> 02:02:55,473
...from the bottom of my heart

1742
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:57,709
That's a once in a
lifetime opportunity

1743
02:02:57,785 --> 02:03:00,618
I couldn't miss that for the world

1744
02:03:02,957 --> 02:03:04,549
Thanks for being a true friend, Abhay

1745
02:03:07,962 --> 02:03:09,520
I owe you big time

1746
02:03:38,759 --> 02:03:40,124
Who are you looking for?

1747
02:03:41,829 --> 02:03:43,456
Is this Neha Kapoor's house?

1748
02:03:44,064 --> 02:03:46,032
Yes, and who are you?

1749
02:03:46,133 --> 02:03:48,601
I'm a friend of hers, Rohan Bhatia

1750
02:03:49,003 --> 02:03:50,732
Could I come in and meet her?

1751
02:03:52,173 --> 02:03:54,107
No. She's not at home

1752
02:03:54,175 --> 02:03:55,540
She will return in a few days

1753
02:03:56,143 --> 02:03:57,474
Please leave

1754
02:03:57,545 --> 02:03:59,069
You're lying

1755
02:03:59,947 --> 02:04:01,608
I know she's inside

1756
02:04:02,750 --> 02:04:04,012
I can feel it

1757
02:04:06,086 --> 02:04:08,452
Neha. Neha, it's me Rohan

1758
02:04:08,556 --> 02:04:09,614
Hey, what are you doing?

1759
02:04:09,690 --> 02:04:13,421
Neha, I just want to talk to you
- Get lost

1760
02:04:13,694 --> 02:04:16,629
I promise I won't put
you in a spot this time

1761
02:04:16,697 --> 02:04:17,959
I said get lost

1762
02:04:18,499 --> 02:04:19,557
Neha!

1763
02:04:20,134 --> 02:04:21,624
Get lost

1764
02:04:22,937 --> 02:04:25,633
What? This is public property

1765
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:28,531
I can stand here as long as I want

1766
02:04:28,676 --> 02:04:33,079
This is our property, we
own this side of the road

1767
02:04:33,581 --> 02:04:36,607
Well, you don't own this side

1768
02:04:37,418 --> 02:04:38,646
I'll just stand right here

1769
02:05:07,181 --> 02:05:09,172
Hey, get lost from here!

1770
02:05:11,519 --> 02:05:12,645
My dear...

1771
02:05:27,401 --> 02:05:29,892
Get up, get up!

1772
02:05:30,638 --> 02:05:31,832
Here

1773
02:05:33,707 --> 02:05:35,038
Wash your face

1774
02:05:35,442 --> 02:05:37,410
Neha has called you inside

1775
02:05:37,611 --> 02:05:40,136
Really?
- Yes

1776
02:05:40,581 --> 02:05:42,981
I have stopped lying now

1777
02:06:16,517 --> 02:06:17,745
Neha

1778
02:06:18,986 --> 02:06:21,819
I know you don't want
me back in your life...

1779
02:06:22,556 --> 02:06:26,686
...and I understand but
I want you to know that...

1780
02:06:27,461 --> 02:06:30,396
...I want to be a
part of our baby's life

1781
02:06:31,999 --> 02:06:36,527
I'm not saying I want to
take our baby away from you

1782
02:06:37,404 --> 02:06:40,532
I'm just saying I want
to shower our baby...

1783
02:06:40,608 --> 02:06:42,405
...with all the love in this world

1784
02:06:43,744 --> 02:06:48,807
I want to be there to
see it's first sonogram

1785
02:06:49,850 --> 02:06:51,715
I want to be there when it's born

1786
02:06:52,052 --> 02:06:55,544
I want to be there when
it cries, crawls, walks...

1787
02:06:56,824 --> 02:07:03,093
I want to be there witnessing
it's life as much as possible, Neha

1788
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:08,067
Will you give me a
chance to love our baby

1789
02:07:08,869 --> 02:07:11,429
The way it truly
deserves to be loved by me?

1790
02:07:18,579 --> 02:07:24,814
You finally loved someone
more than yourself, Rohan

1791
02:07:27,988 --> 02:07:34,985
You loved our baby more than yourself

1792
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:44,431
Over the last few days,

1793
02:07:47,574 --> 02:07:49,132
whenever I asked myself...

1794
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:51,878
...the question "why do I want
to have our baby", Rohan...

1795
02:07:53,547 --> 02:07:56,038
...Why do I really
want to have our baby?

1796
02:07:58,619 --> 02:08:04,785
Not once did I get the
answer that I want it because...

1797
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:08,620
...I am ready to be a mother

1798
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:14,626
Not once

1799
02:08:18,439 --> 02:08:20,373
The only answer I got was that

1800
02:08:24,111 --> 02:08:26,636
I want it

1801
02:08:31,518 --> 02:08:33,850
so I could cause you pain

1802
02:08:37,458 --> 02:08:39,085
by denying you access to it

1803
02:08:43,363 --> 02:08:45,456
A baby needs to be
brought into this world...

1804
02:08:46,667 --> 02:08:48,999
...for the right reasons, Rohan

1805
02:08:50,738 --> 02:08:52,569
to parents

1806
02:08:55,042 --> 02:08:56,805
who are ready

1807
02:09:01,849 --> 02:09:03,840
But I wasn't ready, Rohan

1808
02:09:06,954 --> 02:09:08,478
I wasn't ready

1809
02:09:13,894 --> 02:09:16,328
I dropped our baby, Rohan

1810
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,974
I dropped our baby

1811
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:50,797
I am sorry, Rohan

1812
02:09:56,804 --> 02:10:03,676
We all go through moments of darkness

1813
02:10:07,748 --> 02:10:09,045
I hope you can forgive
me for going into mine

1814
02:10:17,858 --> 02:10:21,055
We both need each other...

1815
02:10:26,033 --> 02:10:29,093
...to conquer...

1816
02:10:31,672 --> 02:10:38,077
...our worlds of darkness

1817
02:10:45,018 --> 02:10:47,885
We both are each
other's fireworks in the sky

1818
02:10:57,064 --> 02:10:58,622
I love you, Rohan

1819
02:11:03,537 --> 02:11:05,004
Always have

1820
02:11:11,979 --> 02:11:13,537
Always will

1821
02:11:18,886 --> 02:11:20,444
I love you too, Neha

1822
02:11:22,789 --> 02:11:24,347
I love you too
