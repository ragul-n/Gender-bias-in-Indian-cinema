00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,167
Kamala...

4
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,708
Am I working?

5
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,750
What do you do here?

6
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,667
Go to school

7
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,542
p

8
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,750
Snowy cold for the water

9
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,375
Kamala, it does not matter.

10
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:59,167
5 months from your husband

11
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,917
I'd go to Shimla to find Rajeshji now.

12
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:06,000
He is responsible.

13
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,250
What is Harudin's sister saying?

14
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,000
She lives with her husband in the next village.

15
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,750
She has her own problems.

16
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,833
What should she say?

17
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,292
Did you know Kankarni Mukesh?

18
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,375
He said he would leave Shimla tomorrow.

19
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,542
Should I ask you too?

20
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,667
Do not argue with Mukesh.
He told me to pick her up.

21
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,250
Does he decide that he is not able to bring the pastor?

22
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:46,500
Does he look like my kid?

23
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,500
I again spoke to the tourists.

24
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,167
You can not raise the kid.

25
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,125
They leave here in the morning.

26
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,000
I've been told.
Get up at your jeep.

27
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,917
Do not have money for your trip?

28
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,917
have

29
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,083
Okay.

30
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:38,542
Look at the mania.

31
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,417
I'm afraid, I'll see.

32
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,292
Kamala. The car came.

33
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,042
what's news

34
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,583
A little bad!

35
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,542
Snow speed will be hampered.

36
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,250
What about your travelers?

37
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,500
They were trapped.

38
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,000
There is no way but to walk down to the bottom.

39
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,000
I went to bring back the car.

40
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,833
Your transaction broke down.

41
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:38,292
Not only mine, but everyone!

42
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,542
Who knows how ITBP will come and keep track of Roddeo?

43
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:09,292
Kamala, asks you the chief.

44
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,625
why?

45
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,792
What happened?

46
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,000
Is the Mukesh meeting?

47
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:08,667
What are you doing here? Bye.

48
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,583
Prayer.

49
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,375
Did you ever know about him?

50
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:15,750
no.

51
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,167
Did you try to call him?

52
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,875
and.

53
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,958
What's up with you? Does His Number Work?

54
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,708
When did you last talk to him?

55
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,708
5 months ago

56
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,875
Did you scandal with him?  no.

57
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,333


58
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,125
I think Prakash is working with Harud.

59
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,500
No, they're not working in one place.

60
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,292
Due to fall in safety standards

61
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,458
Accidents occur in those works.

62
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,292
Mahesh did not come
back from town.

63
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,958
He hears another wife.

64
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:50,042
If something had been running, Rakesh J may have informed us.

65
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,333
We'll call Rakesh Ji again. The phone line has been in disarray for a few days.

66
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,917
Harud is a clever man.
He will come back.

67
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,917
afraid!

68
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,333
The jeep will go if you do not look at it quickly.

69
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,792
No laugh!

70
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,833
Mani!

71
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,750
Kamala...

72
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,542
what?

73
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,208
Take me

74
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:12,917
Who can compare your lamb?

75
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:18,333
Put it down and take me.

76
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,458
And why have you called up to get more?

77
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,625
Did it happen?

78
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,833
Who's late at night?

79
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,542
Is not a woman?

80
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,375
where are you going

81
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,500
Where will you go this night?

82
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:20,833
Let us take you.

83
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,042
Hold him!

84
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,167
Where did he come to him?

85
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,792
Do not bother you!

86
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,417


87
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,333
No ..  The bag is not.

88
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,083
Pandey, you have a gun around him.

89
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,792
Was this in our truck?

90
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,500
@ # $ $%

91
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,208
# $$%

92
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,958


93
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,208
Lie here!

94
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,250
There are also bullets.

95
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:12,250


96
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,250
What's your name

97
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,625
Navasudhin

98
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,833
Is that a name?

99
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,167
Go and walk with her mother.

100
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,708
No, I'll walk in your pants.

101
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,208
Kamla is far behind us.

102
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,792
She's gone for a shoe.

103
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,000
Did you have your previous and pointed

104
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,042
what?

105
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,167
Is there a need?

106
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
what?

107
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm fine.

108
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:51,375
I'll call you back.

109
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,708
Are you from Chitkul village?

110
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,667
My brother has married a woman from your village.

111
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,417
Are you in Shimla?

112
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,792
Giving to this guy, go.

113
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:22,917
No = no!

114
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:26,500
Go!

115
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,000
No = no!

116
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,167
Go!

117
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:50,167
Kamla said she gave it to you.

118
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,625
Get it.

119
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,750
Shimla, Shimla and Shimla.

120
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,833
All of us have gone backwards.

121
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,875
For you?
Shimla.

122
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,458
All animals do not have toilet.

123
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:55,500
I will pay you.

124
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,708
Sorry, mum.

125
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,417
I'll sit in the seat.

126
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,958
It's Keriko to quit.

127
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:01,750
I have a baby with me.

128
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,583
Stay tuned.

129
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:13,667
I want to go to Shimla.

130
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,458
I want to go to Shimla.

131
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,167
Help me

132
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:32,917
His name is Nawazuddin.

133
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,958
Go to my address.

134
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,625
How much will you give

135
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,542
-300.
- 300 takes away!

136
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,750
We're ready to do that twice.

137
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,417
There is nothing near me.

138
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,333
Check the bigh. Of course there will.

139
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,333
Make sure 500 is not enough?

140
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,500
Look, you look at me.

141
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,417
Why did you laugh?

142
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,208
Is it like a fool?

143
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,958
Pre-order Rs 200.

144
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,958
I'll get there.

145
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,292
So now. I do not have faith in you.

146
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,375
What if you betray me?

147
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,542
I'm not cheated.

148
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,125
How do I know? It is not written on your face.

149
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,125
How can I trust you?

150
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,708
Well, let's go with someone who has faith.

151
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,083
lolz!

152
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,292
Check post, check post.

153
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,208
Look, here's a look.

154
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:33,458
Dhinaram, Practice number .175.

155
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:36,333
Bottom line. Turn left to left

156
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,583
Money

157
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:56,708
If we come to the place.

158
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:11,042
Quick walking.

159
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,083
Walk fast without walking like a goat.

160
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,958
That's the shop.

161
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:56,917
You are here. I'll come back soon.

162
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,875
pay the paisa?

163
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,875
rakshiji?

164
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,667
inside ask.

165
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,917
Throw it out!

166
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,167
leave it!

167
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:42,958
Who is this Harud?

168
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:46,833
Have you seen him?

169
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:24,917
what?

170
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,375
rakshiji?

171
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:27,792
Who

172
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:28,917
Kamala.

173
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,500
Come on inside.

174
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:48,542
sit down.

175
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:50,125
rakshiji?

176
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,000
He is not here.
From town to school for 3 days.

177
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,750
Where is your child? Sit back.

178
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:03,167
Where is your daughter?
Did not you get along with her?

179
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,833
When will he come?

180
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,083
I can not tell.

181
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:08,958
Where is your daughter?

182
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,542
-You left her to sister.
Are you staying at home?

183
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,250
Yes, yes.

184
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,167
Leave the village without telling anyone, then

185
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,917
Call me my husband

186
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,708
What are you doing this?

187
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:30,042
There is information from Harud for 5 months.

188
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,792
- Harudov? Are you a husband?
- Yes.

189
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:35,583
Work for the job. He will definitely call.

190
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,292
Rakeshji worked for him in that place.

191
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:42,375
But now my husband is not in that company.

192
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,833
No calling a phone call now

193
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,958
Is not his number near you? You call him.

194
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:54,042
No one responds.

195
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,042
His number must have changed.

196
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,417
The typewriter was typical of a letter.

197
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
Now there is nothing.

198
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:03,833
Do not worry.

199
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,042
You stay here.I will call your country.

200
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:12,208
They take you away to the land. You are beautiful.

201
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,583
Mania, come on.

202
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:37,250
Here's money.

203
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:57,208
100... 250. Koothichi! May your father give you a 50 rupee?

204
00:48:57,292 --> 00:48:59,458
Did no one teach you to keep your word?

205
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:00,417
hunted

206
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:08,750
Who is this Harud?

207
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,375
Your husband?

208
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,417
That's right... you snatch you off.

209
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:27,333
Then the other women are looking to pick up. Farewell!

210
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,208
Is not that the story?

211
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:48,875
what?

212
00:51:56,875 --> 00:51:58,750
Get back to your village.

213
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:04,833
There is no point in rotating here.

214
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:08,208
You're here, here and there...

215
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,542
And then, I have no goal.

216
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,917
Today in Delhi, tomorrow is Calcutta, and then on Mumbai then why not.

217
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,583
Harudd is in Delhi.

218
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:35,125
There is a trace of your hand in your hand.

219
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:37,625
One for every occasion.

220
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:43,083
There is no place where he will be ..

221
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,583
Delhi is a big city.

222
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,708
We will have to call autorickshaw.

223
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,125
It happens.

224
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:59,917
We can settle it on 500.

225
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,000
I do not have that much money for me.

226
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:08,708
Look at the bag. Anyway. Is the ice pelted ice?

227
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:09,750
Look at it.

228
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:11,792
no.

229
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:19,333
Is not your ring gold?

230
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,083
Let's say...

231
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:37,042
Wow, maany, come on.

232
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:38,458
Listen....

233
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,292
POWER!

234
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:54,417
She is so angry!

235
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,333
Look quickly, I'll be with you too.

236
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,167
Ticket purchase. let's go.

237
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,750
I'm going to go.

238
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,125
Delhi is a dangerous place for women.

239
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:22,167
The train will not show you kindness.

240
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:26,375
I'll look it up.

241
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:28,625
There is an animal with you. Unlawful.

242
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,458
I can handle the like!

243
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:33,750
This does not hurt you in the train.
Please tell me. I'll see...

244
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,667
Take a quick paise

245
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:38,625
What's wrong?
Waggetted.

246
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:42,000
Soon, let's miss the train.

247
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,417
Please.

248
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:49,833
Are you tired of getting ticket?

249
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,042
This is what's always mine.

250
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:53,625
No, no, no. Ok look.

251
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,125
Train will leave

252
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,208
Not at all!

253
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,708

254
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:59,167
No more money.

255
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:02,583
Just do one thing. Please bite.

256
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:05,875
Delhi will have many expenses...
Hotel, auto, it is.

257
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:09,500
I can go to work at his work and do not worry.

258
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:12,625
Take a quick look.

259
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:15,625
The vehicle started hammering. Faster.

260
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,667
There is nothing to think about. Come on.

261
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:58,958
I do not like him.

262
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:00,458
me too.

263
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh, goodbye!

264
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:39,750
Is it going for free?

265
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:43,375
No meat is available for free. Of your wife.

266
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,167
Stay, give something Hey.

269
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:54,167
60 to 60!

270
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:06,167
Maha, gentlemen!

271
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:11,042
Mantra is not magic. No scam, no leader of the leader. We're the king.

272
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,875
If two numbers get the same number, Raja!

273
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:19,583

01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,167

20 by 60!

278
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:45,167
Oh no!

279
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:49,792
The glass is not the same number

280
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:53,083
So, you beat the company.

281
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:54,083
Let's look at more.

282
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:59,333
Read here. Not every 10. 20th.
One single opportunity.

283
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,375

292
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:29,500
Animals do not get hurt. Look at the other place.

01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:33,542
20 or 30 more patio.

294

Is ration card adequate?

301

Ration card is enough. Have a photo angry

302
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:51,583
I do not have a photo in my card.

303
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,292
No photo. The photo was angry.

304
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,250
Take away the copies.

305
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:58,583
The photo copy should come by tomorrow.

Open the eye and see. No cheating. No betrayal.

330
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:01,125
It's not like the leader's scam.

60 to 60!

332
