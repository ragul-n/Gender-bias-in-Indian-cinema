1
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:27,750
 "Nandlal, Gopal, have mercy on us.."

2
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,416
"Please give us a place at your doorsteps."

3
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:39,208
 "Nandlal, Gopal, have mercy on us.."

4
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:45,791
"Please give us a place at your doorsteps."

5
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:51,333
 "Give the wealth to someone else.."

6
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:56,125
 "Give the wealth to someone else.."

7
00:03:56,625 --> 00:04:01,583
 "But give your blessing to us."

8
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:07,208
 "Nandlal, Gopal, have mercy on us.."

9
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:12,833
"Please give us a place at your doorsteps."

10
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,833
 "Nandlal, Gopal, have mercy on us.."

11
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:37,833
"The body and soul should be in good condition."

12
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:43,666
"The body and soul should be in good condition."

13
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:49,000
 "And we should never forget you."

14
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,666
"We should lose ourselves so much in your devotion.."

15
00:04:55,166 --> 00:05:00,125
"We should lose ourselves so much in your devotion.."

16
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:05,666
"That the whole world would feel that we are mad."

17
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,666
 "Nandlal, Gopal, have mercy on us.."

18
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:41,708
"A poor person like me, can't go to Gokul and Mathura.."

19
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:49,000
"A poor person like me, can't go to Gokul and Mathura.."

20
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,916
 "..on the pilgrimage."

21
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:58,750
 "When I look into my heart.."

22
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,166
 "When I look into my heart.."

23
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:09,666
 "I can see you there."

24
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:15,250
 "Nandlal, Gopal, have mercy on us.."

25
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,750
"Please give us a place at your doorsteps."

26
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:26,125
 "Give the wealth to someone else.."

27
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:31,666
 "But give your blessing to us."

28
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,666
 "Nandlal, Gopal, have mercy on us.."

29
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,166
 Now, I have become a Sikh.

30
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,750
 Azam. - Yes, boss. - How do I look?

31
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,666
I swear, even I feel like saying 'Sasriyakal' (Greetings).

32
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:14,666
Listen to me. I trust honesty completely.

33
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,250
For a few days, I will be hiding in this disguise.

34
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,458
Don't search for me. And I will come when it is necessary.

35
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,916
 Hail Lord. - Yes, sir.

36
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,416
The party from Delhi has asked for two kids.

37
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,291
 What happened to that matter?

38
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,750
Sir, these days the kids are cleverer than the elders.

39
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,000
But still, we are trying to kidnap two kids..

40
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,833
..and send them to Delhi. - Make it fast. - Yes, Sir.

41
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,416
 We are ready.

42
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,666
 Wonderful..

43
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,833
 Okay, we are leaving now.

44
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,000
And prepare something sweet for the kids tonight.

45
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,750
 Okay, sir. - Come, let's go.

46
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,333
 Sir. - Yes.

47
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,958
Can you do me a small favor? - Yes, tell me.

48
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,458
 I need Rs.10.

49
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,625
It's been about eight-ten days since you got the salary.

50
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,291
 Yes, sir. But Bajrang has a taxi.

51
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,666
It is always under repair. He needs to buy some parts.

52
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,125
Okay, fine, I'll give it to him on my way.

53
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:12,000
Father, one day we sat in brother Bajrang's taxi.

54
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
The taxi used to go forward once and sometimes..

55
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,000
..used to go backwards. It was so much fun.

56
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:27,958
 Help. Help. What's happening..

57
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,833
 Move. Move.

58
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,416
 What happened?

59
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,791
 Get down. Get down, you idiot.

60
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:44,541
Get down. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him.

61
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:51,291
I salute to Hindus, Muslims and the Sikhs, who has done..

62
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,791
..this to me. - Do you drive the taxi with eyes closed?

63
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,708
The taxi drivers assume that the pedestrians are fools.

64
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,666
 No. I'm not at fault.

65
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,208
If it is not your fault, then whose fault is this?

66
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,916
 It is my taxi's fault.

67
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,458
When I put it in the front gear, it goes in the reverse gear.

68
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,166
 And when I put in the reverse gear..

69
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,208
..in goes in the front gear. When I want to go front..

70
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,000
..it goes back and when I drive back, it goes front.

71
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 I used the brake, but it didn't stop.

72
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,708
And when I stopped the engine, the engine didn't stop.

73
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,791
 Then why don't you change the parts.

74
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,250
 Definitely, I will.

75
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,541
 First of all, let me change my dress..

76
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:28,541
..then I will change everything. - Come, let's go.

77
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,166
 How does it look from back.

78
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,791
 I can't see it.

79
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,750
 Wonderful..

80
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,750
What a design, it is? The latest mini style pant.

81
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,625
If some fashion designer sees it, we would definitely copy it.

82
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,875
 Brother Bajrang.

83
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,208
Greetings, Brother Bajrang. - Greetings.

84
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,958
Brother Bajrang, why are you sitting inside? Come outside.

85
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:02,250
I am not in a position to come outside. - Bajrang. - Greetings, sir.

86
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,625
Greetings. Your aunt sent Rs.10 for you.

87
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,458
 Sir, this is your money.

88
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,250
She might have asked you to give me the money.

89
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,000
Does it make any difference? - Sir, I am such a boorish man.

90
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,083
Instead for helping aunt, I have become a burden for her.

91
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,875
You are not a burden. She is just like your mother.

92
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,583
You are right. - Come, let's go to the school.

93
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,375
 Sir. You go to the bank.

94
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,500
I will drop Ganesh and Munni to the school. - Okay.

95
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,750
But Father, come back at 5 o'clock to receive us.

96
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,458
 Okay, I will come at 5 o'clock.

97
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,458
Ganesh, this door is not working. Come from that side.

98
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,500
Fulfilling the promise is more important than life.

99
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,791
Fulfilling the promise is more important than life.

100
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,333
 Trivedi. - Yes, Chaturvedi.

101
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,291
 This is a great devotee of God.

102
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,333
I have been watching him since 10 years.

103
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,791
He comes to the temple daily and worships God.

104
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,791
 May God bless him and his family.

105
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,791
 Amen, Amen.

106
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,250
Madan, this is a road, but not a stage..

107
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,208
 ..that you would dance here.

108
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,250
 What rubbish?

109
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,958
I was going on my way. If your eyes are not working properly..

110
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,166
..go get them checked by the eye specialist.

111
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,458
 If I had any problem with my eyes..

112
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,625
..I wouldn't have got the license of the Taxi driver.

113
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,208
Taxi driver. Have you seen your uniform?

114
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,291
It looks like you have stolen somebody's taxi.

115
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,791
What did you say? You called me a thief?

116
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,750
 Good morning, teacher.

117
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,250
 Ganesh and Munni?

118
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,000
Brother Bajrang. Why are you fighting with her? She is our teacher.

119
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,458
So, you are a teacher. I didn't know it.

120
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,750
Please, forgive me. I've seen you many times on this road.

121
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,166
But I thought that you were a student..

122
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,791
..but I didn't know that you are a teacher. - Shut up.

123
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,416
Kids, you would come with me. What is your fare?

124
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,041
 Teacher, he our brother Bajrang.

125
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,000
He is the nephew of the aunt at our home.

126
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,791
He never charges money from us. You come with us. - No.

127
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,250
Listen, do you want me to get a saucer? - What?

128
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,500
Please, don't be angry. I have misbehaved with you.

129
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,625
I don't have a mother, but I bind you with my aunt's oath.

130
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,541
Please let me drop you on my taxi. Please come, teacher.

131
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,541
Ask her to come. - Yes, teacher. Please, come with us.

132
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,708
"Sometimes forward and sometimes backward."

133
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,875
"Sometimes upward and sometimes downward."

134
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,958
 "Sometimes left and sometimes right."

135
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,958
 "I don't know where it takes me."

136
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,000
 "I don't know where it takes me."

137
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,958
 "Laila, my Laila."

138
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,958
"Sometimes forward and sometimes backward."

139
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,958
"Sometimes upward and sometimes downward."

140
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,958
 "Sometimes left and sometimes right."

141
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,041
 "I don't know where it takes me."

142
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,958
 "My Laila. My Laila."

143
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,041
"Sometimes forward and sometimes backward."

144
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,041
"Sometimes upward and sometimes downward."

145
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:01,041
 "Sometimes left and sometimes right."

146
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:30,041
"The taxi named Laila, get boorish customers."

147
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,333
"Those who doesn't have any money in their pockets."

148
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,958
 "Pauper, hungry, and naked.."

149
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:45,958
"But today, by luck, I got a beautiful customer."

150
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:53,291
"The engine, accelerator and brakes are in love with her."

151
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,541
"Sometimes forward and sometimes backward."

152
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,500
"Sometimes upward and sometimes downward."

153
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,416
 "Sometimes left and sometimes right."

154
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:05,333
 "I don't know where it takes me."

155
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:09,416
 "My Laila. My Laila."

156
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,416
"Sometimes forward and sometimes backward."

157
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,416
"Sometimes upward and sometimes downward."

158
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,416
 "Sometimes left and sometimes right."

159
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,500
"The water and the petrol are in equal proportions."

160
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,250
 "Then, why did Laila stop?"

161
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:18,166
"Because, she jealous of the competition."

162
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:22,958
"A woman's disease of suspicion is very bad.."

163
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,958
 "How can we make her understand?"

164
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:33,333
"What would a horse eat, if it makes friendship with grass?"

165
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,625
"Sometimes forward and sometimes backward."

166
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,500
"Sometimes upward and sometimes downward."

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,500
 "Sometimes left and sometimes right."

168
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,416
 "I don't know where it takes me."

169
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,250
 "My Laila. My Laila."

170
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,250
"Sometimes forward and sometimes backward."

171
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,250
"Sometimes upward and sometimes downward."

172
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,166
 "Sometimes left and sometimes right."

173
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,125
 "I don't know where it takes me."

174
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,041
 "My Laila. My Laila."

175
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,041
"Sometimes forward and sometimes backward."

176
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,041
"Sometimes upward and sometimes downward."

177
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:13,041
 "Sometimes left and sometimes right."

178
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,458
 Brother, Bajrang. Bye. - Bye.

179
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,458
 Please don't mind.

180
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,791
 Here it is. - Thanks.

181
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,416
Count it. - There is no need of it. You can never go wrong.

182
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,250
 Sir, the boss is calling you.

183
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,625
 He called me? I am coming.

184
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,166
 Greetings. - Greetings.

185
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,541
 Is your work done? - Mr. Sadhuram.

186
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,958
Where there is a good and intelligent person like you..

187
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,541
 ..nothing could go wrong over there.

188
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,041
Mr. Sadhuram, if you need any help from me, don't hesitate to call me.

189
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:18,041
 Yes, okay. - Greetings.

190
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,416
 Have you called me?

191
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,708
Yes, I want to introduce you to someone.

192
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,625
 Mr. Dinanath. Mr. Dinanath. - What?

193
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:34,250
He is Mr. Sadhuram. He is a very old cashier of this bank.

194
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,875
And he is a famous musician, Mr. Dinanath Shastri.

195
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,500
 You might have heard his name.

196
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,250
 Yes, I hear his name almost everyday.

197
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,541
You are absolutely wrong. My program is on air very rarely.

198
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,250
I'm not talking about the radio. We don't even have one.

199
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,166
 Then, where do you listen about me?

200
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,166
 From your sister Vidya. - From Vidya.

201
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,166
 What does she come to the bank for?

202
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:05,916
Not in the bank. She comes to my house to teach my kids.

203
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:11,041
You're Sadhuram, whose kids are my sister's students.

204
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,666
Please forgive me, sir. I couldn't recognise you.

205
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,708
It seems that both of you are very well acquainted.

206
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,083
 I called you because, Pt. Dinanath..

207
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,250
..wants to open an account in our bank.

208
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,791
Please fill this from with your hands and open his account.

209
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,333
 Pandit (Master).

210
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,791
 Pandit, please give him the money.

211
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:39,000
 Yes. No. Here it is.

212
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,333
 Take this.

213
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:46,250
Dinanath, the one who gets an account..

214
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,291
..opened with Sadhuram's help, prospers.

215
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,500
Today, you have 500 in your account, but..

216
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,500
..within one year there will be Rs.5000 in your account.

217
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,875
That means, Mr. Sadhuram is a very noble person.

218
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,541
 Birju.

219
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:02,791
 Hey, Birju.

220
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,416
Birju. - Where did this elephant come from early in the morning?

221
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,875
 Birju, I am going to buy vegetables.

222
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,500
 Please, drop me at the market.

223
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,958
 Market? - Yes, market.

224
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,708
 Where is this sound from?

225
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,083
 I guess your tier has gone.

226
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,541
 My tier.

227
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,250
 You've ruined me.

228
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,250
 Fatso, what have you done?

229
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,708
 Tier has got burst.

230
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,791
Do you know the cost of a second hand tier these days?

231
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,333
 Stop laughing.

232
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,333
I wonder from where this coal mine came into my taxi.

233
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,250
Birju, why are so angry at me these days?

234
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,958
 You don't even talk to me with love..

235
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:39,708
..nor do you look at me with love. - I don't care about you.

236
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,041
Whenever we meet you start you age old rubbish.

237
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,958
I wonder why I borrowed money from your father..

238
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,250
..because I have to pay it with interest. - Hey, Birju.

239
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,291
That's means we were right. Dilawar Singh is in this city.

240
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:58,041
Yes, sir. And I have set a team of policemen around the city.

241
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:59,166
 But be careful.

242
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,500
Dilawar Singh might have changed his appearance.

243
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,958
Sir, the culprits change their appearances, but police..

244
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,541
..never changes its uniform. - Well said. Go ahead.

245
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,666
 Thank you, sir.

246
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,958
Come fast. - Sir, Laila is handicapped right now.

247
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,791
Look at the red bandage. Come from that side.

248
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,125
 Wonderful. - These Sikhs are so great.

249
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,708
They don't differentiate between anything.

250
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,875
 They are content with anything.

251
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,125
 Sir, where do you want to go?

252
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,416
Start the taxi. Go where I ask you to go.

253
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,416
 That is what my job is. - Go right.

254
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,625
 Wow, Laila.

255
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:49,041
 "I got stuck in a rope.."

256
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,708
Sir, where do you live? - What do you got to do with that?

257
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:59,583
Nothing. I am asking just like that. Your face is very familiar.

258
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,708
Do you belong to Tarantaran, Ludhiana or Amritsar?

259
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:05,916
Thank God, you didn't say Jalandhar, Panipat or Karnal.

260
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,583
Sir, you said the names of all the districts of Punjab.

261
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,083
Sir, have you ever been to London? - Yes.

262
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,541
And you must also have been to America? -Yes. Yes.

263
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,666
You just drive the taxi. - Sir, I am driving the taxi.

264
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,541
 I am not riding a bullock-cart.

265
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,583
 Sir, say something about America.

266
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:26,250
 When Marlin Monroe committed suicide..

267
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,458
 ..did you attend her funeral?

268
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,833
If you don't stop talking, I have to attend your funeral.

269
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,083
 Likewise. - What did you say?

270
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,083
 Sorry, sir. I got confused..

271
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:41,250
..because the police jeep is following us.

272
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,791
 And many people loses their memory..

273
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,000
 ..when they see the police

274
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,333
Have you seen the English movie Random Harvest?

275
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,416
 Take the left.

276
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:53,416
 "Promises and oaths.."

277
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,750
 Take the left. - Oh, my God.

278
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,750
 Take right.

279
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,666
 Left.

280
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,000
Sir, you are confusing me. Where do you want to go?

281
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,583
 Go straight. - Okay.

282
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:18,583
 Go fast. - Okay.

283
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,500
 Why did you stop the car? Go forward.

284
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,500
Sir, only a ship can go forward. A taxi can't go forward.

285
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:40,666
Sir, before you jump into the water pay the fare.

286
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,583
 How dare you to ask me money.

287
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,750
 Then, whom should I ask?

288
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,833
Be happy that a person like me travelled in your taxi.

289
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:51,541
 Come with me. Even my taxi is grand.

290
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,083
 Cheap guys don't sit in this.

291
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:57,541
Its name is Laila. Now, give me Rs.14.50.

292
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,541
You are asking me money. Don't you want to stay alive.

293
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:01,500
 You hit me.

294
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,166
 You touched me.

295
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,333
 You touched a taxi driver.

296
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:10,166
You...You are messing with a taxi driver. My name is Bajrang.

297
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:14,250
I fought with people like Dara Singh, Milka Singh..

298
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,541
 I guess you never faced a real Sikh.

299
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:18,791
 Hey, get lost.

300
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,916
If you were a real Sikh, you would have given me..

301
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:27,750
..two Rs.10 notes, without taking the change.

302
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,541
Give me my money. - Should I? - Yes. - I'm giving you.

303
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:36,000
This taxi isn't your father's. The petrol isn't your mother's.

304
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,250
Take this. - Sir. Sir, please take this weapon back.

305
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,250
 Please take this back.

306
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,166
Now, you learnt the lesson. - Yes, sir. I learnt my lesson.

307
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:52,166
Sir, I forgot that this is not Tarantaran or Amritsar..

308
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,583
..but this is Mumbai. I am a servant of yours, sir.

309
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:58,166
Sir, keep this weapon back where you took it out from.

310
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,250
 Now you got me. - Yes, sir.

311
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,583
 Go away.

312
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,750
Sir, whatever I take, I will not give you. Sir, first you leave this place.

313
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,750
And if you speak about me with anyone I will kill you.

314
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:16,833
Sir, I swear by God, that I will never tell this to anyone. - Okay.

315
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:21,625
 Today, you deceived a taxi driver.

316
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:27,541
I curse you, that one day you will die in a taxi.

317
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:33,416
Hello, Mr. Marathe. I have sent the statement.

318
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:38,541
Didn't you get it? Okay, I will send the duplicate copy.

319
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,541
 Mr. Sadhuram, there was a call from..

320
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,541
 ..the manager of State bank of Pune.

321
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,541
He is saying that he didn't receive the statement..

322
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,250
..which we sent them last week. - We sent them.

323
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,333
Then, send a duplicate copy today itself.

324
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,083
 This is very important. - Okay.

325
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:58,416
Sorry, you have to work over time. - It's okay. It's okay.

326
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,583
 Greetings.

327
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,041
 Ganesh, father didn't come till now.

328
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:07,041
 He comes at 5 o'clock daily.

329
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,666
 Hari Om, have you seen these kids?

330
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:14,541
 Yes, boss. This is a good opportunity.

331
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:18,541
We got the kids for the Delhi party. - Come with me.

332
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,166
 How is the ice cream? - It is fine.

333
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,833
 What is you name? - My name is Munni.

334
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,166
 It is a very beautiful name.

335
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:32,541
My name is also beautiful. My name is Ganesh.

336
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:35,583
Your name is beautiful too. - What is you name?

337
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,916
I will tell uncle's name. Uncle's name is ice cream uncle.

338
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:42,583
 Very good. You are a very wise person.

339
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,416
 Eat it.

340
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:51,916
Go start the car. - Okay. - I will bring these kids.

341
00:26:52,416 --> 00:27:01,166
Pandu, attach the stamps and post them. - Okay, sir. - Be quick.

342
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:06,833
It is already 5:30. The kids might be waiting for me.

343
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:11,583
Bahadur Singh, after Pandu comes, lock it properly.

344
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,833
 I am in a hurry. - Okay, sir.

345
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,916
Why are you worrying? Our sir is good with kids.

346
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:20,916
He is coming with the kids. Start your car.

347
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,083
Brother Bajrang.. - What are you doing here till now?

348
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:30,000
School has closed for the day, but father hasn't come yet.

349
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,000
Okay, come with me. I will drop you at home. - Oh, no.

350
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,416
 All the kids are gone? - Yes.

351
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,541
Why didn't Munni and Ramesh wait for me?

352
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:55,000
The road is full of traffic and vehicles.

353
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,083
 Good evening, teacher. - Good evening.

354
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:02,833
Hang on. Teacher, do you just teach the kids? - Why?

355
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,333
What's your opinion on me? - About you?

356
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:10,166
Because my aunt still treats me like a kid.

357
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:11,750
Do you want me to treat you like a kid?

358
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,541
Yes, but only at study. I want to learn English.

359
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,333
But I know Good morning, Good evening and Thank you.

360
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,166
 But I am not good at alphabets.

361
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,708
How can such a big man learn alphabets?

362
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,541
Teacher, when I was learning to drive..

363
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,416
..I used to have an L-board behind the car.

364
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,416
And when I will learn ABC, I will attach it behind my back.

365
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,541
So that people will think that I am a learner.

366
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,541
 Excuse me, I am getting late. - Okay.

367
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,833
 Okay, one minute, teacher.

368
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,666
Teacher, do you teach the kids lessons or singing?

369
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,708
What are you saying? - Because, when you talk..

370
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:55,416
..I can only hear sweet and melodious tunes.

371
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:58,583
 What a great smile?

372
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:03,250
This smile is just like the final bell in the school.

373
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,333
 Ganesh. Munni. - Sir, what happened?

374
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,291
Did they come back home? - Yes, Uncle, I brought them.

375
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,291
 Thank God. - Father.

376
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,416
Kids, why didn't you wait for me outside the school?

377
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:16,166
 We waited there for you.

378
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:20,333
A bearded uncle bought us an ice cream.

379
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:24,250
I've told you so many times not to accept anything from others.

380
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,250
 Father, you don't bring ice creams..

381
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,750
..and you don't allow us to eat ice creams from others.

382
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,125
 Ganesh, you are a fool like me.

383
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:35,541
If your father buys an ice cream and brings it to the house..

384
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:40,416
..it will melt down on the way and just the stick will be left.

385
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,041
 Sir, this is about kids.

386
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:45,333
 Your job is an accountant's job.

387
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,541
If you mind what they say and do even a little mistake..

388
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:52,416
..in your job, you'll have to count the pebbles for six months.

389
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,083
What's that? - You will have to go to the jail.

390
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,750
You work with ease. I drive nearby their school.

391
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,541
Whenever you are late, I will drive both of them and..

392
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:04,083
..and rest of the people home. Now, give me Rs.5.

393
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,541
 Rs.5. What for? - As a donation.

394
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,333
We have an association of taxi drivers in Mumbai.

395
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,666
We are doing a charity show for the Prime Minister's fund.

396
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,833
For the fund? - Yes, it is for a good purpose.

397
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:22,000
Give me the money. - But I will give the money on the first.

398
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,541
Which first? - The first of the next month.

399
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:28,541
 Okay, then. I trust whatever you say.

400
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:31,750
Ganesh and Munni, come here. Don't you want to study.

401
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,583
 Go dear, go and study.

402
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:39,833
Sir, ask her to buy one ticket. - You try yourself. Go.

403
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:44,666
Teacher. Will you buy this? - What is this?

404
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,333
This is a charity show, by the drivers.

405
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,083
 I will buy it, but I can't come there.

406
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,541
I know it. Whenever the rich people buy tickets..

407
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:57,416
..of the charity show. They send their maids to attend it.

408
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:59,541
Are you paying me the money, right now?

409
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,083
Or will you pay it tomorrow? - I will pay it tomorrow.

410
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,416
Okay, I will come to your home and collect it from there. - Okay.

411
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:09,333
Are there any dogs in front of your house? - No.

412
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:13,125
Thank God. Anyway, the dogs love me very much.

413
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,250
Even the nicest dogs, who haven't barked ever..

414
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,000
..start wagging their tails when they see me.

415
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,916
 Okay, then. I shall go now.

416
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:27,666
 That's the window. - Ganesh. Munni.

417
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:31,666
 Teacher.

418
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,083
"The night is like a snake without my beloved."

419
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:47,500
"The night is like a snake without my beloved."

420
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,666
 "My heart is worried a lot."

421
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,666
 "My heart is worried a lot."

422
00:31:56,166 --> 00:32:01,500
"The night is like a snake without my beloved."

423
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,750
 Wow. It's really great.

424
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,708
Who are you? You look like a nice person.

425
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:13,666
 My name is Bajrang. I drive a taxi.

426
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,166
What? But I haven't called for any taxi.

427
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,416
 Who's there, Brother? Is it you?

428
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:21,916
 You came here to collect the money?

429
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:25,750
Yes, I came for that purpose. I came to collect the money..

430
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,500
..from you and sell a ticket to your brother.

431
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,083
 But I have changed my opinion now.

432
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,000
You are not good enough to buy the ticket.

433
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,083
What? Who is this fool who is insulting me in my own house?

434
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,166
 Sir. You don't get angry.

435
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,041
I am the cashier of the Taxi Drivers' Association.

436
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:46,750
 I came here to collect the money.

437
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,083
But the money I saw you, I changed got an idea.

438
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,083
You can help us in other way. - What is that?

439
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,916
A great person like you, a talented person like you..

440
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:57,666
 ..a tyrant like you.. - What?

441
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:58,916
 I mean a good singer like you.

442
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:04,666
If you participate in our show, it will add grace to our show.

443
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:09,166
Vidya, how do you know this taxi driver?

444
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:12,666
 Brother, his aunt is the caretaker..

445
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:16,291
..of Mr. Sadhuram's kids. He is a very funny person.

446
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:20,250
Funny person? Tell him, that I am foolish person. A joker.

447
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,250
Sir, will you participate there with these idlers.

448
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,666
 Idlers? - Sorry. I meant that..

449
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,500
..would you participate in the show with your friends.

450
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,208
 It will ruin our show. - What?

451
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:35,750
 I mean it will add grace to our show.

452
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:40,041
Teacher, you please convince your brother.

453
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,250
Brother, this is for charity. Please, participate in it.

454
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,708
Since, it is for charity. I will definitely participate in it.

 He will. That would be fun. Thank you.

00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,500
And now, convince your sister to participate in it..

457
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,833
..so that there is some sensuous appeal to our show. - What?

458
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:03,000
I am sorry. I mean sari appeal. Family appeal.

459
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,666
Vidya, this person is really funny. Since it is for charity..

460
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,041
..why don't you too participate in it, along with me.

461
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:11,916
 Okay, Brother. - I thank both of you.

462
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:15,916
Okay then, I will send two taxis, one hour before the show. - Okay.

463
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:29,166
 Ladies and gentlemen.

464
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:34,583
I welcome you on behalf of the Taxi Drivers' Association.

465
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:39,666
The name of the play which we are going to perform..

466
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:44,250
..for the Prime Minister's fund is 'Dream of the cart-puller'.

467
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,500
And I hope you will be happy to watch the play.

468
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,791
And here we present 'Dream of the cart-puller'.

469
00:34:57,291 --> 00:35:00,666
I have a horse-cart. I have a horse-cart.

470
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,666
 This horse-cart is as good as a car.

471
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,875
 Lalita. Lalita.

472
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,750
What's the matter? - Open the door. I am back.

473
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,250
I won't open the door. Why are you so late?

474
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,541
 You sleep outside today.

475
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:29,416
I will sleep outside for the rest of my life..

476
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,833
 ..but I would never enter your hut.

477
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:35,833
I will sleep in the place of the horse.

478
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,625
 Why are you calling me with signs?

479
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,916
 Do you think that I am a girl?

480
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:18,666
I am Yamdoot (Lord of Death). - What kind of doodh (milk)?

481
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,500
 Goat milk, buffalo milk or cow milk?

482
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,791
Not cow milk. I came from the sky. I am Yamdoot.

483
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:28,833
 Then, what are you doing here?

484
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:33,041
You are dead. I came here to collect your soul.

485
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:38,541
Are you fooling me? Are you talking about that 'sky' film?

486
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:44,000
Look at you dead body and this is your soul.

487
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,250
Come with me. - I have to do like that?

488
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,250
Let me hold my wraparound first. Let's go.

489
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:06,791
Hail Yamraj (Lord of Death). I have brought the Ram of Charminar.

490
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:11,250
Maharaj (King), we have done a grave mistake. - What happened?

491
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,208
This fool has brought Ram instead of Shyam.

492
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:17,875
 Go and put him into..

493
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:27,500
 ..Ram's body and bring Shyam. Go

494
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,375
Oh, no. Maharaj, disaster happened. - What happened?

495
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,000
 He body has been burnt.

496
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,958
 The final rites have been done.

497
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:41,791
 Look there. - You are right.

498
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,416
 What should we do now?

499
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:44,541
 Go and bring Shyam's soul and..

500
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:50,750
..put Ram's soul in Shyam's body. - Okay, Maharaj.

501
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,583
 Come on, Ram. - Ram Who?

502
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,500
Yamraj, I have seen a movie in my village..

503
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,416
..there only the same mistake has been done.

504
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,333
If you want to send me beck, then send me into my body.

505
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:08,833
I won't go into other's body. - Hail Narayan.

506
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,166
 Yamraj, is something wrong?

507
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,416
 Please come, Maharaj Narad.

508
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:18,250
You make him understand the situation. - No.

509
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,416
I have studied in my school about Maharaj Narad.

510
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:23,833
He is the root of all the fights among Gods and Goddesses.

511
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:29,833
 I won't fall in web of his tricks. No.

512
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:34,833
Now, I could understand. His soul is here my mistake.

513
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,083
 The situation is complicated.

514
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,916
 Dear, come with me.

515
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:45,833
Don't worry. Lord Vishnu will solve this problem. - Lord Vishnu.

516
00:38:46,333 --> 00:38:50,500
 Narayan. Narayan. Come.

517
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Narayan. Narayan. Narayan.

518
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,541
 Please come, Narad.

519
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,291
 Who did you bring with you today?

520
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:03,250
You know everything about the three worlds.

521
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,250
 I'm sure you will understand it all.

522
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,833
This is a problem. My responsibility is to protect..

523
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:15,166
 ..the universe from evil.

524
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:19,541
I can't do anything about the deaths and births.

525
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:25,375
Ram, you have to return to the world. - Narayan.

526
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:31,208
Keep quiet. I want to make one thing very clear.

527
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:38,333
If I will go, I will go to my body. I won't enter other's body.

528
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,625
What's your opinion Narad? - Narayan. Narayan.

529
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,833
 Let's go to Lord Shankar.

530
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:47,166
Come, let's go. - Okay, I will take your leave.

531
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:52,750
Hail Lord Shankar. - Welcome saint Narad.

532
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,625
 I know about your problem.

533
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,166
 Lord Shiv, do you know about me?

534
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,083
 I have got a lot of publicity.

535
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,250
 Now, you only can help me.

536
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,083
I can't make this fool understand this situation.

537
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,750
 Goddess Parvati, please help me.

538
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,625
 I'm suffering a lot.

539
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:15,250
I neither belong to the world, nor to the heaven.

540
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,500
 Please, recommend my case to him.

541
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,416
Lord. He seems to be a very innocent man.

542
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:23,708
 Please, have mercy on him.

543
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:29,541
Goddess, only Yamraj can do something about it.

544
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:36,416
Narayan. Narayan. Let's go to Yamraj again.

545
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:40,916
What is this? You have made me visit all the departments.

546
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,833
Here it is just like the world. I want to know something..

547
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:47,833
 Do you get some commission to do this?

548
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:57,541
 Narayan. Narayan.

549
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:02,541
Yamraj, he is a very stiff person. I have a solution.

550
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:05,750
 What is that?

551
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:12,291
He is a human. Give him some money and send him back.

552
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:14,833
 A guest who comes without invitation..

553
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:19,500
..is bound to be troublesome. Narayan. Narayan.

554
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,250
 Don't look for him. He is gone.

555
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,041
 Ram, if I give you Rs.5 lakh..

556
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:33,750
Will you accept some other body? - Never.

557
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,750
 Ram, will you go if..

558
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,166
 ..I give you 1 lakh kg of gold?

559
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,125
No, never. If I go there with so much gold..

560
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:50,583
 ..they will assume that I am smuggler.

561
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,583
 Ram, come here.

562
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:03,583
 Will you drink something?

563
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:07,083
What will you give me? Will you give me Tea or sweetened curd?

564
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:13,916
I will give you Somras (nectar). - What does Somras mean?

565
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,333
 You are talking about liquor.

566
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,166
Which liquor will you give me? Golkonda liquor or scotch?

567
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:22,708
 No. This is the beverage of the Gods.

568
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,000
 You will feel elated if you drink it.

569
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,000
Really. I used to drink country liquor in the world. Give it to me quickly.

570
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,250
The colour of Somras is just like Coca Cola.

571
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,375
 Maharaj. - Yes.

572
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,791
 I want to ask you something. - Yes.

573
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:03,250
In the world, every place is not permitted for boozing.

574
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,125
 What about this place?

575
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,958
Here there are no restrictions. This is heaven.

576
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:14,125
 You can booze wherever you want.

577
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,041
 Okay, sir.

578
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:20,125
And there is one more thing I want to ask you. - Yes.

579
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,291
 Come here.

580
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,958
I am saying it before I drink. And later, don't say that..

581
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:30,791
..I said it in a drunken state. There was a beauty. - Beauty?

582
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:35,583
I mean, there was a girl. Her name was Chunia. - Chunia.

583
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,458
 Yes. She is a very modern girl.

584
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,208
She had an affair with me, but she used to look at..

585
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:44,833
..another person and she used to think about another person.

586
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,375
 That's why she died so soon.

587
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,791
 If you let me meet her..

588
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:52,708
..I assure you, I would enter any body without any mess.

589
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:57,083
 Then enter those clouds..

590
00:43:57,583 --> 00:44:03,041
 ..where Chunia is waiting for you. Go.

591
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:10,000
 "Chunia, where are you?"

592
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,000
 "The princess of my heart."

593
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,125
 "The grandmother of my grandchildren."

594
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,625
 "Look, I am here."

595
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:23,625
 "Look, I am here with permission."

596
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:36,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

597
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:40,625
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

598
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:44,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

599
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:47,958
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

600
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:52,291
"I left Charminar and sold my horse-cart."

601
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:56,458
"I came running to you. Please accept me."

602
00:44:56,958 --> 00:45:01,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

603
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,916
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

604
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:08,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

605
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:12,208
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

606
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:45,500
"Your beautiful eyes. Your lovely hair."

607
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,958
"Your lovely words. I want to mix all of them and drink."

608
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,041
"Your lovely laughter. Your lovely package."

609
00:45:56,541 --> 00:46:02,708
 "They are just killing me."

610
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,541
"If you turn away your head this time."

611
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:06,791
 "If you break my heart this time."

612
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:08,875
 "I swear by my mother.."

613
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:10,958
 "I will drink some poison."

614
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:14,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

615
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:18,375
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

616
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:23,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

617
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:27,208
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

618
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:43,416
 "Wow, your dance is great."

619
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,625
"How is the dance master in the heaven?"

620
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,625
 "Who did you learn it from?"

621
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:55,041
 "Why are you showing me your teeth?"

622
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:56,958
 "Please come nearer to me."

623
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,625
"Acting smart, are you? I'll grab you."

624
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:04,708
"You don't come and you don't let me come near you."

625
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:11,458
"You burn my heart. I warn I will clasp you."

626
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,416
 "Why are you doing like this?"

627
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,416
 "Why are you so harsh to me?"

628
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,791
 "Why do you ridicule me?"

629
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:20,041
 "I warn you I will hug you."

630
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,458
 "I warn you I will hug you."

631
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:24,500
 "What is your plait for?"

632
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,750
 "What is your awkwardness for?"

633
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,875
 "What is this shake for?"

634
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,041
 "Please broaden your heart."

635
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:35,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

636
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:38,208
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

637
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:42,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

638
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:45,791
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

639
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:50,041
"I left Charminar and sold my horse-cart."

640
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:54,208
"I came running to you. Please accept me."

641
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,208
 "Darling, make me the groom.."

642
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:01,958
 "..and set fire in my kitchen."

643
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,958
 "Please set fire in my kitchen."

644
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:07,125
 "Use the oil and start the fire."

645
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:10,208
"Shall I bring a matchstick from the earth?"

646
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:13,500
"I want to eat the food prepared by you."

647
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,291
"My queen. My Chunia. Where are you going?"

648
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:22,625
 "Please come back."

649
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:23,958
 "Come back."

650
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:27,958
 Come back. Come back.

651
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:38,791
Why did you beat me? - Why did I beat you?

652
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:45,041
Because you were asking the girls to come back. Aren't you ashamed?

653
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:49,208
Lalita, I am your husband, right? - Yes.

654
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:50,625
 I am father of a son. - Yes.

655
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:52,208
 And you are my wife. - Yes.

656
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:53,958
And you are mother of three kids. - Yes.

657
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,208
 If you have slept here, in my place..

658
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:58,041
 Would I have shouted like you?

659
00:48:58,541 --> 00:49:02,416
 Do you know the name of this place?

660
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:10,333
 What? - In dreams. In the dreams.

661
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:13,458
The pair of the birds costs just Rs.10. Will you buy it?

662
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:19,041
The price is too much. - Sir, these are love birds.

663
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,208
 They cost Rs.10, including the cage.

664
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,708
I want it without the cage. Tell me, what would you charge?

665
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:28,291
Without the cage? Will you take the birds in your pocket?

666
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,708
It is none of your business. Tell me how much will it cost?

667
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:35,125
 Rs.5. - I will pay Rs.4.

668
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:36,958
 Rs.4. No, sir. It will cost Rs.5.

669
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:41,208
You didn't give birth to them. You caught them in the jungle.

670
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:46,916
Sir, you look like a good person. Okay, give me Rs.4.

671
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:53,708
 1, 2, 3, and 4.

672
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:57,708
 Take this.

673
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,500
 Mahatma, what have you done?

674
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,416
The crows will kill those birds. Even you will die one day.

675
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:16,291
At least, these birds will die with freedom. Go.

676
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:22,791
Great. I am surprised to see a pure hearted person like you.

677
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:27,708
Are you Sadhuram? - Yes, I am Sadhuram, but who are you?

678
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:31,375
Sadhu, did you forget me? I am your childhood friend.

679
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:35,375
 Dilawar Singh. - Dilawar Singh.

680
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:42,458
You are Thakur Balur Singh's son Dilawar Singh.

681
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,541
 Yes, you are right.

682
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,041
 But what about your appearance.

683
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:48,458
 It is because of Allah's grace.

684
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:49,500
When the times are changing, it doesn't take much..

685
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,791
 ..to change the appearance.

686
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:55,375
Dilawar, I feel like my childhood and youth..

687
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,875
..has returned upon meeting you. - How nice?

688
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:02,875
Come, let's go to my house and talk over there. - Okay.

689
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,541
Dilawar, if you don't mind, shall I ask you something?

690
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:11,750
 Please, please.

691
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,375
 How did you change your religion?

692
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,250
You asked me after a long time. It is a very strange story..

693
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,250
..how I became Sher Khan form Dilawar Singh.

694
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:24,916
You know that I am an orphan. My uncle brought me up.

695
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,083
But my uncle married for the second time at an old age.

696
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:32,458
My aunt was young. And he didn't want me over there.

697
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,250
That's why I decided to leave the house..

698
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,750
 ..before he asks me to leave.

699
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,166
 That's why went to Kashmir.

700
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:41,500
There was a lot of trouble in Kashmir during those days.

701
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
There he saved a rich Muslim from the goons.

702
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,750
 There were goons in Kashmir?

703
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,250
 There were no goons in Kashmir..

704
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,541
 ..but some crept from outside.

705
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:52,958
But the government has thrown them out.

706
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:56,333
What happened then? - That person didn't have kids.

707
00:51:56,833 --> 00:52:00,250
He adopted me. After some days he gave me..

708
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,833
..all his wealth and he passed away. - And then?

709
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:09,500
With that money, I built a temple and a mosque..

710
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 And I donated some money to the poor.

711
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,833
 You have done a great job.

712
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,166
 There is nothing better than charity.

713
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:20,750
Have you saved some money for yourself or not?

714
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,333
What will I do with money? I don't have a wife of kids.

715
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:28,291
But I have invested around Rs.10 lakh in firms in Delhi.

716
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,166
Then, why don't you get a fixed deposit in some bank?

717
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:32,416
 What are you saying?

718
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,750
I am a Muslim, so I can't charge interest.

719
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:40,250
This is even better. Still there are many people..

720
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:45,458
..who give money for credit and royalty instead of interest.

721
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:49,166
 Allah will definitely punish them.

722
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,541
 Mumbai is such a big city.

723
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:55,000
So, I was wondering that I should invest money here.

724
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
 What are you doing?

725
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,250
I am the cashier of the City cooperative bank.

726
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,500
You are a cashier. - That is great news.

727
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,500
If I invest my money here, I may need to meet you.

728
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,750
I shall leave now. - Where are you going?

729
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,750
I am staying in a hotel, but I didn't like the place.

730
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,250
That's why, I was thinking of changing the place.

731
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,500
You're staying in a hotel? Why are you insulting this friend?

732
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,250
 When you have your own house..

733
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,333
..what is the necessity to stay in a hotel?

734
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,000
 I have a vacant room upstairs.

735
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,791
I can provide you the kind of food which I eat.

736
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:27,333
Okay, Sadhuram. You are right. But now I am a Muslim.

737
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,750
If I stay here, it may effect your worship.

738
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,250
What are you saying? In this country, we can hear..

739
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,458
..the bells ringing as well as the prayers in the Mosque.

740
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:39,291
When it doesn't effect the county, how can if effect my home?

741
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:43,291
No, ifs and buts. Come, I will show you the room.

742
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:00,500
 Greetings. - Greetings.

743
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Please come. I will drop you to your house.

744
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,083
I travel by bus. - But what is this taxi for?

745
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:09,000
 But I don't have money right now.

746
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,375
 What a blow you have given me.

747
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,541
Am I that selfish that I won't drop you to your house.

748
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,000
But the petrol will get over. - My heart..

749
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,416
Let the petrol get over, or else, my heart will shrink.

750
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:25,833
Please come. - I will come, but you to shut your mouth.

751
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:30,000
 Okay, I will keep quiet.

752
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,750
Listen, if you sit in the back seat, I'll assume..

753
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,916
..that you are a passenger and I will charge money from you.

754
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:37,000
If you want to have a free ride, please sit in the front seat.

755
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,500
But do you remember the condition? - I will keep quiet.

756
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,500
 Hold on. Gents first.

757
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,750
 Why are you staring at me like that?

758
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,750
 Answer my question.

759
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:28,083
 I said that you can't talk..

760
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:32,041
..but you can talk if ask you anything.

761
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:34,833
Yes, tell me. Why were you staring at me like that?

762
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,250
 I agreed that I won't talk..

763
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,166
..but I didn't say that I won't stare at you.

764
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:41,916
 You have answer to everything.

765
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:44,875
 Teacher, he who is a school drop out..

766
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,083
 ..has answers to everything.

767
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:49,791
 Why didn't your parents let you study?

768
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:53,500
 Teacher, it is matter of destiny.

769
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 My father was a school teacher.

770
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,250
 There was a vacant place in heaven..

771
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:03,500
..when I was 10 days old. So, God gave him that place.

772
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,375
I heard that father loved my mother a lot.

773
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:10,250
That's why father called my mother over there..

774
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:15,500
 Since then, my aunt has brought me up.

775
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,583
She bore this burden. She worked hard to support me.

776
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:24,958
The only thing she was not able to give was education.

777
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,541
 Being a school master's son..

778
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:30,000
..the urge for education was in my blood.

779
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,250
And that urge made me learn to read and write on my own..

780
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:35,000
 ..without going to any school.

781
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,541
..which I did in spite of many handicaps and obstacles.

782
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,250
When the question of my livelihood arose..

783
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,250
..I decided upon on an independent career..

784
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,333
 ..without having to serve anybody.

785
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,250
But my problem was, that I didn't have any university..

786
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:51,416
..degree or diploma, nor any financial resources.

787
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:54,708
So I made up my mind to become a taxi driver.

788
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:57,250
And teacher, I personally feel that there is nothing..

789
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,708
..to be ashamed of, to be a taxi driver. Am I right?

790
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:02,000
 Shut up. - What?

791
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,458
 I said, stop the car.

792
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:09,666
 We haven't reached your home yet.

793
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,833
I will go walking, but I won't travel in a liar's taxi.

794
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:15,666
 But whatever I said is the truth.

795
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,791
If this is truth, then whatever you said that day was a lie..

796
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:24,083
..that you don't know ABC. - I am sorry, teacher.

797
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:27,791
Sometimes, a person has to lie for some benefit.

798
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,666
What kind of benefit? - I won't tell you this thing.

799
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:32,583
If I will tell you, you will get down from the taxi.

800
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,458
 What is that?

801
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:42,166
Promise me that you won't get angry. - Okay, tell me what it is.

802
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:47,083
 I.. - What is that?

803
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:49,916
 I.. - What is that?

804
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,666
Under the pretext of learning the alphabets, I wanted to sit near you.

805
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:55,041
 Why?

806
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:57,833
 'Why' is very dangerous.

807
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:05,666
I can't dare. How can a taxi driver ask a teacher..

808
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:08,958
There is no need to say anything else. Drive the taxi.

809
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:11,125
 You got me? - Drive the taxi.

810
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:15,125
 You didn't get me.

811
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:27,500
 Teacher, before you leave, assure me..

812
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,875
 ..that you are not angry with me.

813
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:32,916
Don't forget that I am a school teacher.

814
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:35,250
 Many kids yell in the class..

815
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,375
..that doesn't mean that I am angry with everyone.

816
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:40,625
 Am I a kid?

817
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:44,625
You are not a kid, but you sound like a kid.

818
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:55,750
 I hate liars. - Who are you mad at?

819
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,083
 Whose letter is this?

820
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:58,375
 What can I tell you, my friend?

821
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:00,500
I am in a lot of trouble in this new city.

822
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,666
 The Delhi party is due for 1 lakh..

823
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,791
..but they are extending the date since first of this month.

824
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:07,500
 But here it is written in the letter..

825
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,500
..that you have to send the money within a week.

826
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,250
Why is it so urgent for you? - I am an ordinary person.

827
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,666
Even the richest persons fall in the financial mess.

828
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:19,458
I've seen a very nice place to open a new office.

829
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:20,958
 It'll cost Rs.1 lakh.

830
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:23,500
And I've agreed to pay Rs.15,000 in advance.

831
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,333
But I have just Rs.10,000 with me, right now.

832
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,500
Now, I have to lose this place or I have beg someone..

833
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,416
..in this new city. - Give him 10,000, right now.

834
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:37,500
And pay the rest later. - I am a man of my word.

835
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,541
When I agreed to pay 15,000, I will pay 15,000.

836
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:44,791
Is that money important, Dilawar? I mean, Sher Khan.

837
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,375
 This is a matter of my reputation.

838
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,500
 Mr. Sadhuram, you are saying that..

839
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,166
..Mr. Sher Khan is a very rich person. Well, he may be.

840
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:55,291
 May he prosper even more.

841
00:59:55,791 --> 01:00:00,541
 But I don't know him at all.

842
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:05,500
Did I say something wrong? - But you know me.

843
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,500
 Mr. Sadhuram, if you need money..

844
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,583
..here are the keys to my locker. I won't even look at it.

845
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,875
Take whatever you want. - This is your generosity..

846
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,458
 ..that you trust me so much.

847
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:21,166
But my friend needs just Rs.5,000 for few days.

848
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:25,375
Even the people of the bank, need money some times.

849
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:27,000
I won't send you back with empty hands.

850
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,250
 Lalla, go and bring Rs.5,000.

851
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,166
I have just counted Rs.5,000 and kept it aside.

852
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:35,500
Then, count it again. If one extra note goes..

853
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,250
..it will be an insult to Goddess Lakshmi.

854
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,458
And if one note is less, it will be our insult.

855
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,833
Father, we may get insulted, but Goddess Lakshmi won't.

856
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:45,708
 Here, Mr. Sadhuram.

857
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,041
 Sher Khan, take the money.

858
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:49,708
Mr. Sadhuram, I will give the money to you..

859
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:53,791
 ..and get your sign on the papers.

860
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,500
Okay, as you wish. Sher Khan, take this money.

861
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,666
Hold on for a second. First, sign here.

862
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:01,500
After that the money will be yours. Then, you may give..

863
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,500
..this money to Sher Khan or anyone you wish.

864
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:13,291
Take this. Thank you very much. - That's all right.

865
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:15,000
 Thank you very much, my dear friend.

866
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,125
You have saved me from insult, in this city.

867
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:22,666
 Come, let's go.

868
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:26,125
Mr. Sadhuram, you are a very contented and happy person.

869
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:28,500
What was the necessity for you to borrow money..

870
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,500
..for someone else? - He is a childhood friend of mine.

871
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,500
If I don't help him here, who else will help him?

872
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,375
I am saying this because you are a very straight person.

873
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:40,208
And the world at this moment is very crooked.

874
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:41,916
 You don't worry, sir.

875
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:46,375
My friend will return the money within a week. - Okay.

876
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:49,000
If you trust him so much, then I can't tell you anything.

877
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,666
 Here is the safe's key.

878
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,458
 But why are you giving this key to me?

879
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:57,416
I forgot to tell you. I am going to Baroda for a couple of days.

880
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:58,916
There is the meeting of the board of directors.

881
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,208
 This key will be with you till I come.

882
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:06,708
 Sir, your train is at night. - Yes.

883
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:09,625
So, I want you to come to my home, in the evening.

884
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,000
 Why? Is there something special?

885
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,625
 It's my daughter's birthday today.

886
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:14,833
I want you to come and give your blessings to my kids.

887
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:16,666
 That's really a happy occasion.

888
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,000
Okay, I will come there for a couple of minutes..

889
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,833
 ..before I go to the station. - Okay.

890
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:24,833
Happy birthday, kid. - They are just like your kids..

891
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:29,291
..there is no need for this. - Who are you to interrupt me? Here, dear.

892
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:33,291
 Happy birthday.

893
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:46,375
Greetings, brother Bajrang. - Greetings.

894
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,250
 I am not destined to get a new taxi..

895
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:53,000
..but I have brought this new car for you.

896
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,375
Brother Bajrang, will this car go forward or backward?

897
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:58,375
 Have you seen it?

898
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,166
Now, even these kids have started making fun of me.

899
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:04,625
Happy birthday, Munni. - Thank you, teacher.

900
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:08,166
 Take this dear. Have sweets.

901
01:03:08,666 --> 01:03:12,166
 Bajrang, you too take it.

902
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,750
Everyone take the sweets. Listen, come here.

903
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:48,375
"A for apple. B for baby. C for camel. D for daddy."

904
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:54,458
"A for apple. B for baby. C for camel. D for daddy."

905
01:03:54,958 --> 01:04:00,458
"A for apple. B for baby. C for camel. D for daddy."

906
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,916
 "D for dadi (beard)" - "D for daddy."

907
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:06,666
 "D for dadi (beard)" - "D for daddy."

908
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:09,833
"A for andha (blind). B for behra (deaf)."

909
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,958
 "C for Cana (squint). D for duffer."

910
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:16,958
"A for apple. B for baby. C for camel. D for daddy."

911
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:55,083
"E for England. F for Finland. G for Greenland. Sing it."

912
01:04:55,583 --> 01:05:01,166
 "G for German. H for Holland."

913
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:08,083
"I for our India." - "Hail Motherland."

914
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:12,083
"Leave A,B,C and start learning Ka, Kha, Ga (Hindi alphabets)."

915
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:23,083
"Leave A,B,C and start learning Ka, Kha, Ga."

916
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:28,375
"Forget the foreign tunes and sing Sa Re Ga Ma Pa."

917
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,916
 "Sing Sa Ra Ga Ma Pa."

918
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:33,375
 "Ga Ma Pa."

919
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:38,416
"Ga for Gai (cow). Ma for Makan (house)."

920
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,916
"Ga for Gai (cow). Ma for Makan (house)."

921
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,541
"And what is for Pa?" - " Pita (father)."

922
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:48,458
"Leave A,B,C and start learning Ka, Kha, Ga."

923
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:53,458
"Start learning Ka, Kha, Ga." - "Ka, Kha, Ga."

924
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:57,458
 "Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa."

925
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:45,000
"N for Narangi (orange). "O for Oh, Hari Om."

926
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,666
 "And P for Prem patra (love letter)."

927
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:53,375
"You don't get angry, after you read my love letter."

928
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:59,125
"You don't get angry.." - "P for Prem Patra. And what does Q stand for?"

929
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:08,250
"Q for Queen. R for Roti (flatbread). S for Saag (vegetable)."

930
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:15,541
"A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q... L, M, N, O, P, Q.."

931
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:18,125
 "Ka, Kha, Ga." - "A, B, C."

932
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:21,416
 "Ka, Kha, Ga." - "No, A, B, C."

933
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:25,416
"Stop fighting about English, Hindi and Urdu."

934
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:36,583
"Stop fighting about English, Hindi and Urdu."

935
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:38,833
 "Speak Tamil, Bengali and.."

936
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:41,458
 "..other languages of our country."

937
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:46,416
 "If you can learn, then learn.."

938
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:51,375
"If you can learn, then learn all the education of the world."

939
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:56,291
"Stop fighting about English, Hindi and Urdu."

940
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:58,833
 "Speak Tamil, Bengali and.."

941
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:02,833
 "..other languages of our country."

942
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:36,500
 Munni's birthday was great.

943
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,083
I bought her new dresses, which is a big relief for me.

944
01:08:42,583 --> 01:08:44,833
What else can an ordinary bank cashier..

945
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:48,583
..do for his kids other than this? Am I right, Dilawar?

946
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,416
It is all God's grace. You bought dresses for the kids.

947
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:54,291
 They are happy, as well as you are.

948
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:55,833
But think about it. It is not happiness..

949
01:08:56,333 --> 01:09:00,916
..but it is betraying oneself. - Betrayal. Why is it betrayal?

950
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:03,541
 I didn't get you. - I will explain it.

951
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:06,916
Patience is the hurdle in the path of a person's growth.

952
01:09:07,416 --> 01:09:08,833
If a person gets food for the two times..

953
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:11,750
..he isn't worried about anything else.

954
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,458
 Tell me honestly, if you are happy.

955
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:18,166
Why shouldn't I be happy. I have two beautiful kids.

956
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:21,750
I have a good job. I get the salary on the first.

957
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:24,666
And I've a lot of goodwill in the bank and among the people.

958
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:26,458
And what is the value of that goodwill?

959
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:28,750
 Around Rs.400-Rs.500 per month.

960
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,833
Friend, don't speak like that. My salary may be 500..

961
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:34,375
..but my goodwill is worth lakhs of rupees.

962
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:38,333
Look at this. Tell me what's this? - Key.

963
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,541
 This is not an ordinary key.

964
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,833
 This is the key to my bank's locker..

965
01:09:43,333 --> 01:09:45,000
 ..where there are millions of rupees.

966
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,833
If the agent of the bank doesn't trust me..

967
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:51,833
..why would he hand this key over to me?

968
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:58,416
What are you staring at? - Nothing.

969
01:09:58,916 --> 01:09:59,833
 You are becoming happy..

970
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:02,833
..as if all the money if that safe is yours.

971
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:06,083
This is not a key, but it is a handcuff. - Handcuff?

972
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:06,958
 Yes, a handcuff.

973
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:09,291
 Assume that you go somewhere..

974
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:11,541
 ..and you meet with an accident.

975
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,666
And then you faint. And the key falls down.

976
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:14,833
 Someone else picks up the key..

977
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:17,291
 ..and steals the money from the safe.

978
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:20,666
 Now, tell me, if it isn't a handcuff..

979
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:22,833
 Sher Khan, tell me, what's the matter?

980
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:26,083
 Nothing. At times, I get chest pain.

981
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:28,833
Shall I call the doctor? - No, I have the medicine.

982
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:33,250
I have kept in my briefcase. I will bring it.

983
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:37,250
 God, help Sher Khan.

984
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,416
 What happened?

985
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:42,083
 At times, it becomes too painful.

986
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,625
 Do you have anything made of iron?

987
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:47,416
 Some knife or key or something.

988
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:52,750
Yes, I have a key. - That would be better. - Here it is.

989
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,875
I need some water. - Hold on for a second.

990
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:58,875
 Water. Water.

991
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:06,041
 Where's it..

992
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,083
 Sher Khan, here's the water.

993
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:21,041
 Don't worry. I am here.

994
01:12:21,541 --> 01:12:24,083
 Thank God that you were here..

995
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,625
 ..and you gave me this iron instantly.

996
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:29,416
 You saved my life. Here is your key.

997
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:31,083
How long have you been having this problem?

998
01:12:31,583 --> 01:12:32,875
 Since about ten years.

999
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,958
 Sometimes it becomes too painful.

1000
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:37,416
What is this in your hand? - It is for remedy..

1001
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:40,500
..which helps me when the pain is too much.

1002
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,708
 A saint in Kashmir gave me.

1003
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:45,041
If I touch it, the pain reduces to some extent.

1004
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:48,208
This is your superstition. Visit a good doctor.

1005
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,250
 This kind of things doesn't work.

1006
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:54,041
You won't understand it, Sadhuram. My life is in this.

1007
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:59,875
Okay, go and take rest. - Yes, I need to take rest. - Go.

1008
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:03,875
 Thank God.

1009
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:10,916
 Boss, you got a fortune, this time.

1010
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:13,541
 I always look for fortunes.

1011
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:15,833
I don't get involved in ordinary things.

1012
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:20,791
Now, it is your duty to get me a key just like this model.

1013
01:13:21,291 --> 01:13:24,416
Boss, you don't worry about it. In fact, we were apprehensive..

1014
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:26,541
..since Sadhuram is your childhood friend.

1015
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:28,625
 What if you go weak?

1016
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,166
 Correct. Correct.

1017
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:33,416
 Here is the key to bank's safe.

1018
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:35,625
 Why did you bring it on a holiday?

1019
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:37,541
You could have given it to me tomorrow.

1020
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:40,791
The sooner the responsibility is detached, the better.

1021
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,708
 Listen. - Yes.

1022
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:46,750
Has your friend returned the money which he borrowed?

1023
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:53,541
No. Not yet. But he will return it soon.

1024
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:57,041
Sadhuram, I couldn't sleep the whole night.

1025
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:58,333
 Why? Did you get those attacks again?

1026
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:01,708
No. But I am worried about my responsibilities.

1027
01:14:02,208 --> 01:14:04,125
The party from Delhi is not in touch with me.

1028
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:06,333
 No letter. No phones.

1029
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:09,166
I am worried about the money which you borrowed for me.

1030
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:11,541
 And also the time is ending.

1031
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:13,791
I feel that I should go to Delhi and bring the money myself..

1032
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:16,125
..and payback the money which you have borrowed.

1033
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:18,208
Is it necessary for you to go personally?

1034
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,416
How many days more can I wait for them?

1035
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:23,166
One should complete the task which one has taken.

1036
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:25,333
Do you want me to bring something from Delhi?

1037
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,791
 Well, since you are going there..

1038
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:30,083
..I want you to bring some dust from Rajghat.

1039
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,708
 Dust from Rajghat? What will you do?

1040
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:35,500
 Everyone has his own beliefs.

1041
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,791
 Mahatma was the God of Ahimsa.

1042
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:41,708
I am a devotee of Ahimsa and a follower of Bapu (Gandhi).

1043
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:45,208
I am not sure if I will visit in future.

1044
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:46,791
If I rub the dust of Rajghat on my forehead..

1045
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:49,291
..my wish will be fulfilled to some extent.

1046
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:52,458
 Come fast.

1047
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:58,208
 Bring them. - You sit in the taxi.

1048
01:14:58,708 --> 01:15:01,625
Birju, wait. You don't worry. I am with you.

1049
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:03,875
 Inspector. - What's the matter?

1050
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:08,791
Please don't hurt Birju, he is my future husband.

1051
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,625
Take her outside. Not you man. You go outside.

1052
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:15,916
 I told you, he is a very angry man.

1053
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:17,958
Come here. - Yes.

1054
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:21,333
So, you drive a taxi? - Yes, sir.

1055
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,958
 What is your name?

1056
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,791
Why are you making faces? I am asking your name.

1057
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:33,875
Sir, my name is Bajrang and my number is 786.

1058
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,875
I look like a bad person, but I am a very good person.

1059
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:41,625
Because my eyes are red, people assume that I do drugs.

1060
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,500
But I swear by your mother, I don't have any bad habit.

1061
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,791
 And I drive the taxi accurately.

1062
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:49,333
When the passenger comes into the taxi, I raise the meter.

1063
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:52,500
And when he goes out, I pull the meter down.

1064
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,916
Even if I meet traffic inspector or a police or a constable.

1065
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:58,958
I respect everyone. I start my taxi at 5am..

1066
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:04,291
..and stop it at 10pm. And after that, I don't drive.

1067
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:07,791
I don't drive in Juhu, Paras road, Pali Hill.

1068
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:10,291
And I drive taxi with my eyes, ears and everything open.

1069
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:14,541
Till now, I ran over a chicken, which was already dead.

1070
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:17,791
 My record is very clear.

1071
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:19,583
Once a kid came in front of my taxi all of a sudden.

1072
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:21,833
 I pressed the brakes suddenly.

1073
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:23,541
 And another taxi crashed into my taxi.

1074
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:25,125
I can see the things which are in front of me.

1075
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:28,208
Even if I can't see the things that are behind.. - Break.

1076
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,708
What's this nonsense? - You asked me to put brakes.

1077
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:33,125
 But who asked you all these questions?

1078
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:35,875
Sir, the insurance people ask even more questions.

1079
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,791
 This is not an insurance company..

1080
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:40,333
..but this is a police station. - Right, sir.

1081
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:45,833
I want to know that who travelled in your taxi last week.

1082
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:49,750
Sir, many people got into my taxi last week.

1083
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,250
If anyone travels in my taxi, is that a crime?

1084
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,000
Yes, a foreigner lady got into my taxi.

1085
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,791
 Instead of giving me Rs.10 note..

1086
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:58,000
 ..she gave me a 100 rupees note.

1087
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,833
Even I handed that Rs.100 note to the police station.

1088
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:02,708
 And also, I lost Rs.10 over there.

1089
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:04,916
I don't want to listen anything. - Yes, sir.

1090
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:08,333
 Try to recollect. Tell me, last week..

1091
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,750
..did a person with a beard hire your taxi?

1092
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:15,166
Last week? A bearded person? Sir, last week, it was Guru Nanak's birthday.

1093
01:17:15,666 --> 01:17:17,500
Many of my Sikh friends got into my taxi.

1094
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,041
Which bearded-man are you talking about?

1095
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:21,791
I am talking about that person who had a suitcase..

1096
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:24,291
 ..and a stick in other hand.

1097
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:27,250
 The stick. A stick is very useful.

1098
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:28,708
 I won't tell you, sir.

1099
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:31,416
 If you won't tell me, I will kill you.

1100
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:34,333
Birju, tell quickly, or else he will kill you.

1101
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,458
 Shut up. Don't interfere between us.

1102
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:38,708
Tell me quickly or else I will kill you.

1103
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:41,041
This is even better. If I will tell you my mom will be dead..

1104
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:42,625
..and if I don't tell you, then the father will eat the dog.

1105
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,291
Whose father will eat the dog? - I didn't mean your father.

1106
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,708
This is just a saying. A father had the habit of eating meat.

1107
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:50,208
One day there was no meat, so the mother cooked a dog.

1108
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:51,291
 The son saw it.

1109
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:52,791
And when it was the time for the dinner, the son thought..

1110
01:17:53,291 --> 01:17:55,500
..that if he tells the truth to father, he will kill mother.

1111
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,625
And if he doesn't tell him, he will eat the dog.

1112
01:17:58,125 --> 01:18:00,166
 If I tell you, he will kill me..

1113
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:02,625
..and if I won't tell you, you will kill me.

1114
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,541
Bajrang, don't cry. There is no need to fear.

1115
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:08,708
This is a police station. Police will protect you.

1116
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:10,791
 Will the police protect me?

1117
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:20,125
You... Will you protect me? - Definitely.

1118
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:24,125
Sir, this is a very safe place. Here, I am not in danger.

1119
01:18:24,625 --> 01:18:26,291
 Now, I am getting some courage.

1120
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:28,750
Now, I will tell you about that bearded-man.

1121
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:33,791
He was a very tall man. He had a long beard..

1122
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:37,000
..and on the other hand, there was a suitcase.

1123
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,541
Whose tiffin box is this? I am feeling very hungry.

1124
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:45,875
May I eat? - Yes, you can eat and tell me about him. Eat.

1125
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:49,041
 Tell me what happened then? - Water.

1126
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:57,250
Constable, bring some water. Drink slowly.

1127
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,791
The food is great. Will you eat? - No, thanks.

1128
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:01,375
 Have it. Tell me, what happened next?

1129
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:04,791
Sir, that tall man was somewhat scared..

1130
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:08,125
..since the police jeep was behind him.

1131
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,500
At one moment he asked me to turn right..

1132
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,416
..and at the next moment he asked me to turn left.

1133
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:14,625
Then, finally he took me to the seashore.

1134
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:16,666
 There I asked him to pay the fare.

1135
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,791
Then, he took out a knife from his stick.

1136
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:21,791
Then, he warned me not to talk about that incident..

1137
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:23,916
..with anyone, or else he would kill me.

1138
01:19:24,416 --> 01:19:28,041
Then I, along with my taxi came back in the reverse gear.

1139
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:29,791
 Sir, why are you asking me all this?

1140
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:32,083
 Have you too given that moron a lift?

1141
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:34,791
 You are a fool.

1142
01:19:35,291 --> 01:19:40,125
Do you know whom you have given a lift? - Who did I give a lift to?

1143
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:43,375
He was none other than the famous dacoit Dilawar Singh.

1144
01:19:43,875 --> 01:19:45,625
 Right now, he is in the city.

1145
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:48,291
 You would have got 10,000 as reward..

1146
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:49,791
..had you brought him to the police station.

1147
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:50,958
 Who would have given me Rs.10,000?

1148
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:54,041
You would have got it. The government would have given you. - Government?

1149
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:55,791
The government would have given it to me? - 10,000? - Yes.

1150
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,166
10,000? For me? - Yes.

1151
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:05,791
 10,000. sir. 10,000.

1152
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:09,000
Birju, where are you going, without your taxi? - 10,000?

1153
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,458
I will reach there before the taxi reaches there.

1154
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:19,500
 10,000.

1155
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,708
 Mr. Sadhuram, we are here.

1156
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:28,666
Please come. - I will sit later, first you pay the money.

1157
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:29,875
 Where is the money.

1158
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:34,625
I am sorry. My friend Sher Khan didn't come till now.

1159
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:36,791
 We don't care if he didn't come.

1160
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,583
 We have given the money to you.

1161
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:42,166
Mr. Sadhuram, if you are not willing to give the money, say it clearly.

1162
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:44,375
 We know how to take our money back.

1163
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:48,583
 You please don't insult me.

1164
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,166
I have a great respect for your father..

1165
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:51,666
 ..and he also respects me a lot.

1166
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,750
 If you wish you scold my father..

1167
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:57,375
..but before that give back money back.

1168
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,541
Can you wait for a couple of days more?

1169
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:01,333
 I'll not run away with your money.

1170
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:03,750
No one dares to take away my father's money.

1171
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:08,958
If you don't pay the money by tomorrow..

1172
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:14,916
..you have to go to the court and jail.

1173
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:19,500
 Tomorrow. Mind it.

1174
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:31,500
 Court. Jail. Handcuffs.

1175
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,083
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Sir. - Yes.

1176
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:42,708
Like a musician should care about the tunes..

1177
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:46,458
Similarly, a cashier should be careful about with the cash.

1178
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:49,625
What have you done? - Have I done something wrong?

1179
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:53,333
How much was the check worth? - Rs.500.

1180
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:55,166
And how much have you given me? - I have given 500.

1181
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:59,541
If you give Rs.600 on every 500 check..

1182
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:03,500
..the bank people will take you to the police station one day.

1183
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,958
 Here is your hundred rupee note.

1184
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:10,083
Thank you. I haven't done this kind of mistake before.

1185
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:11,250
 And it shouldn't have happened.

1186
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:14,166
Not every person in this world is like Pt. Dinanath..

1187
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:18,166
..who would give a 100 rupee note back. Got it?

1188
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:24,083
 Sir, boss is calling you. - Okay.

1189
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:34,125
 Yes, sir. - Sir, this circular..

1190
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:42,458
 Why are looking at me in that way?

1191
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:47,708
I am trying to recognise you. You are not Mr. Sadhuram.

1192
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:51,416
What are you saying? I am not Sadhuram?

1193
01:22:51,916 --> 01:22:56,958
There is always a sandal dot on Mr. Sadhuram's forehead..

1194
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,416
..and there is always grace on his face.

1195
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,250
And there is a lot of peace in his eyes.

1196
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,625
 Today, I woke up late in the morning.

1197
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:07,208
 I came here without worshipping..

1198
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:08,708
 It is my duty.

1199
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,875
Mr. Sadhuram, don't try to change the topic.

1200
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:15,833
I know that the reason for your worry is those Rs.5,000.

1201
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:22,416
 Am I wrong? - Yes.

1202
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:24,250
 I warned you that day..

1203
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,875
..that the days of helping others are gone.

1204
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:30,541
 The moment I saw your blank forehead..

1205
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:33,166
..I felt like Goddess Lakshmi has left this place.

1206
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:37,250
Please, don't say like that. Lakshmi will always be here.

1207
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,958
I will never come to the office again, without worshipping.

1208
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:44,166
Please, translate it in Hindi and Marathi..

1209
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:48,791
 ..and glue it on the notice board.

1210
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:55,083
And have you heard this? There has been a big robbery...in America.

1211
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:58,166
The robbers have made a duplicate key..

1212
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,250
..with the help of the wax and robbed the bank.

1213
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,250
 Is it possible? - It has happened.

1214
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,833
That's why I am putting this information..

1215
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:10,958
..on the notice board. So that no one would get fooled.

1216
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:13,083
 Okay.

1217
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:17,541
 The world is full of such people.

1218
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:24,958
"Lord says such things are being done since long.."

1219
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:29,166
Trivedi. - Yes, Chaturvedi. - What am I watching?

1220
01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:34,166
For the first time, this man is not worshipping God.

1221
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:36,166
It takes time to become a believer of God..

1222
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:38,958
..but it doesn't take time to lose that belief.

1223
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:40,708
 You are right, Chaturvedi.

1224
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:46,375
Now, the numbers of devotees of God has lessened.

1225
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,791
 Who's there? - Mr. Sadhuram?

1226
01:24:50,291 --> 01:24:53,166
Inspector, it's you? Hold on for a second.

1227
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:55,666
Ramdin, come here and take the kids inside.

1228
01:24:56,166 --> 01:24:58,875
 Kids, go inside. Go.

1229
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,166
 Please come in, inspector. - It's ok.

1230
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:03,375
Mr. Sadhuram. I came to know that a guest is staying here.

1231
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:05,958
Yes, a friend of mine is living here. - Where is he?

1232
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:07,708
 He has gone to Delhi for a few days.

1233
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:08,958
 Since how many days do you know him?

1234
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:12,333
Since my childhood. We used to study together in college.

1235
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:17,416
After that? - After a long time, I met him now.

1236
01:25:17,916 --> 01:25:19,166
 He is a very rich person.

1237
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:22,375
He told me that he has done a lot of charity.

1238
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,250
Look at it carefully and tell me if you know him.

1239
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,500
 Yes, this is an old photo of his.

1240
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,708
 But now, he has a beard.

1241
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:30,791
And also he has changed his name and his religion.

1242
01:25:31,291 --> 01:25:35,166
His name was Dilawar Singh, and now it is Sher Khan.

1243
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:38,500
 He has changed his Religion and name.

1244
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,666
 He just changed his appearance.

1245
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:44,500
I am very confident that he is not Sher Khan..

1246
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,875
..but he is the same old dacoit, Dilawar Singh.

1247
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:54,208
 No. Inspector, how is it possible?

1248
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:56,833
 Everything is possible in this world.

1249
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,666
 Inform me, the moment he returns.

1250
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:03,666
If you don't do it, you will be convicted for helping a dacoit.

1251
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:23,166
If you call me Dilawar Singh, in front of anyone..

1252
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:26,750
..he will think that his dress is that of a Muslim..

1253
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,875
 ..and name is that of a Rajput.

1254
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:34,166
I am very confident that he is not Sher Khan..

1255
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:37,750
..but he is the same old dacoit, Dilawar Singh.

1256
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,708
There has been a big robbery in America.

1257
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:43,166
The robbers have made a duplicate key..

1258
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:47,625
..with the help of the wax and robbed the bank.

1259
01:26:48,125 --> 01:26:51,000
This is a thing which helps me when it is too painful.

1260
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,083
 It makes one lively.

1261
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:56,875
A saint from Kashmir had given this to me.

1262
01:26:57,375 --> 01:27:01,166
If you don't pay the money by tomorrow..

1263
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:07,666
..you have to go to the court and jail.

1264
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:10,583
 He has changed his religion and name.

1265
01:27:11,083 --> 01:27:13,791
 He just changed his appearance.

1266
01:27:14,291 --> 01:27:16,500
 Inform me, the moment he returns.

1267
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,500
If you don't do it, you will be convicted for helping a dacoit.

1268
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:33,375
 Ganesh. Look at father.

1269
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:44,625
 What happened father?

1270
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:48,625
Nothing. My head is aching. You go and sleep.

1271
01:27:57,375 --> 01:28:00,541
Ganesh, father is lying. - He is lying?

1272
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:04,166
 Yes, because the police came here.

1273
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,083
 That scared father.

1274
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:11,208
You are mad. Father is not afraid of him.

1275
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:16,375
Because the cashier is more powerful that a police.

1276
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,500
You are a fool. Police is most powerful.

1277
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,166
You are a bigger fool. Dacoits are more powerful than police.

1278
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:28,166
Ganesh, why are you talking about dacoits at midnight?

1279
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:28,875
 You should sleep now.

1280
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:32,875
You didn't tell us a story tonight. How can we sleep?

1281
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:36,375
 I can't tell you stories all the days.

1282
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:40,375
Go to sleep, otherwise I will beat you.

1283
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:56,958
 Kids, why are you crying?

1284
01:28:57,458 --> 01:29:00,166
I asked you to sleep. I didn't beat you.

1285
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:03,541
If you want to beat, you may beat us.

1286
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:08,166
Yesterday, Babla's father was beating him..

1287
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:10,541
 ..but his mother came and saved him.

1288
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:12,916
 We don't have a mother.

1289
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:17,958
 Oh, kids. I'm like a mother to you..

1290
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:19,708
 I'm like a mother to you.

1291
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:23,541
Have I ever beaten you? Have I ever got angry at you?

1292
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:29,166
Then why did you do it today? - I am sorry.

1293
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:33,166
I will never get angry at you. Now, go to sleep.

1294
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:09,458
 Who's there?

1295
01:30:11,958 --> 01:30:15,458
 Who is there? Who opened the bolt?

1296
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,750
 Who is there?

1297
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,750
 Who is there?

1298
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:04,041
What is this? The guard hasn't closed the door.

1299
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:07,916
 Guard.

1300
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:11,208
 Murder.

1301
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,458
 Bahadur Singh.

1302
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:17,958
Bahadur Singh, who has done this to you?

1303
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:19,583
Bahadur Singh. - Yes, boss.

1304
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:22,958
 Who is that?

1305
01:32:23,458 --> 01:32:26,958
 Who is that?

1306
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,041
 Who are you? Where are you running?

1307
01:34:03,541 --> 01:34:04,875
Dilawar. - Yes, I am Dilawar.

1308
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:07,291
You appearance. The guard's dead body..

1309
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:09,583
..and you coming out of the bank. I can't understand it.

1310
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:11,416
 Shut up. And come with me.

1311
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:14,375
Dilawar, what is there in this briefcase?

1312
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:17,041
You are my friend. I won't hide anything from you.

1313
01:34:17,541 --> 01:34:19,541
This briefcase contains bank's money and jewellery.

1314
01:34:20,041 --> 01:34:21,291
Have you stolen it? - Yes.

1315
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:23,416
And you have also killed the guard? - Yes.

1316
01:34:23,916 --> 01:34:27,208
Oh, God. What are you saying? Is this the truth?

1317
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:31,125
Why would I lie to you? - How could you do this?

1318
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:35,583
This is public's money. I request you to return..

1319
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:38,458
..this money to the bank. - I am not a fool like you.

1320
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:42,833
I won't leave an opportunity like this. - Dilawar.

1321
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:45,375
People used to say many things about me..

1322
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:47,375
 ..but I never believed them.

1323
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:51,375
I always said that my friend can't do a thing like this.

1324
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:56,125
When you got that attack, I gave you the bank's key..

1325
01:34:56,625 --> 01:34:57,916
..and you are giving me this, in return.

1326
01:34:58,416 --> 01:35:01,166
I don't have the time to talk all this rubbish.

1327
01:35:01,666 --> 01:35:03,500
 I am ready to pay you for your trust.

1328
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,375
I can solve all your problems. I will give you Rs.50,000.

1329
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:10,500
 You can pay the Seth's money back..

1330
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,291
..and you can spend the rest of your life happily.

1331
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,708
 You want me to commit a sin like you.

1332
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:19,750
No, Dilawar. I want people's goodwill more than the money.

1333
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:22,041
 I can't take this sinful money.

1334
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:24,041
 What did you get with your goodness?

1335
01:35:24,541 --> 01:35:26,375
You can't spend your life with goodwill.

1336
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:28,833
You need to money to spend your life happily.

1337
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:30,958
 I can give you as much money you want.

1338
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:32,291
 How much do you need? Tell me.

1339
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:35,208
I don't want money. Give me this bag. - No.

1340
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:38,041
You can't run away with the bag, till I am alive.

1341
01:35:38,541 --> 01:35:42,041
I see. Even the saint has started revolting.

1342
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:43,375
Leave me. - I won't leave you.

1343
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:46,291
Leave me. - I won't leave you.

1344
01:35:46,791 --> 01:35:50,791
 Sadhu, get down from the car.

1345
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:55,541
 Don't force me to kill you. Leave me.

1346
01:35:56,041 --> 01:36:01,375
You have cheated me in the disguise of a good Muslim.

1347
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:03,791
And now, you are threatening me with this pistol.

1348
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,916
My work and my honesty is more important to me..

1349
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:07,958
 ..than my life. Remove this.

1350
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:11,500
 I say..

1351
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,500
 Sadhu..

1352
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:21,291
 Dilawar, leave it..

1353
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:56,583
 Dilawar.

1354
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,958
 No.

1355
01:37:07,458 --> 01:37:10,958
 Dilawar.

1356
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:18,291
 Dilawar, how could this happen?

1357
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:23,833
How could I do this? I haven't done anything wrong.

1358
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:27,500
I was stopping you from committing a sin.

1359
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,583
I was trying to show you the right path.

1360
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:36,166
I swear, I haven't done anything wrong.

1361
01:37:36,666 --> 01:37:40,166
 I don't know anything.

1362
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,041
Sir, please sit. Sorry, I went to drink a cup of tea.

1363
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:53,166
If I don't drink a cup of tea early morning..

1364
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:57,166
 ..I can't do anything.

1365
01:38:12,416 --> 01:38:13,666
Sir, I didn't ask you and even you didn't tell me..

1366
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:17,458
 ..where do you want to go?

1367
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:21,583
Sir, I am asking you, where do you want to go?

1368
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:26,166
 Are you dumb?

1369
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:28,375
 Sir, it's you?

1370
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:32,458
I didn't see you and even you didn't call me.

1371
01:38:32,958 --> 01:38:34,958
Sir, where are you coming in this early morning?

1372
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:38,458
 Will you go to the home?

1373
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:42,000
 Sir, you look very worried.

1374
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:46,333
Even your face is sweating. Haven't you slept last night?

1375
01:38:46,833 --> 01:38:48,916
 Yes, I haven't slept last night.

1376
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:54,583
I am right. Or else you face glows in the early morning.

1377
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:58,583
Oh, it got stuck. Laila started singing in the early morning.

1378
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:16,208
Hey, driver. Why don't you stop the taxi's horn?

1379
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:19,333
What? - Why don't you stop the taxi's horn?

1380
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:21,583
 What? - Horn.

1381
01:39:22,083 --> 01:39:24,666
The horn got broken right now. I can't help it.

1382
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:26,666
Repair the care and take it away from here.

1383
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:29,333
I would definitely take it with me. I wouldn't leave it here.

1384
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:32,208
This is model of the times of Queen Victoria.

1385
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:36,208
 Get it repaired then. - I will.

1386
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:41,458
Sir, why are you getting down? Please, sit down.

1387
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:43,666
Today, Laila was shouting in such a way..

1388
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:45,291
..as if someone has shot it in her heart.

1389
01:39:45,791 --> 01:39:47,125
 But it is a very honest car.

1390
01:39:47,625 --> 01:39:50,083
 It became alright in no time.

1391
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:53,125
Someone has done this very smartly. - Yes.

1392
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:56,500
Tell me something, who has the keys to this safe?

1393
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,083
 I have it. See.

1394
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:01,333
And you're the first person to open it in the morning?

1395
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:03,750
No. My treasurer does that in my presence.

1396
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:07,375
Where's he now? - He must be at home. Why?

1397
01:40:07,875 --> 01:40:10,083
 Ask him to come immediately.

1398
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:11,583
 Okay.

1399
01:40:12,083 --> 01:40:14,916
Pandu. - Yes, sir. - Call Babuji (sir).

1400
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:20,833
Babuji, where is that bearded friend of yours?

1401
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:24,833
Who? - The one with a beard, who had gone to Delhi.

1402
01:40:25,333 --> 01:40:26,583
 Did he return from Delhi?

1403
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:28,250
 Babuji, don't make that mistake.

1404
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:32,333
As soon as he returns, hand him over to the police.

1405
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:36,458
 Here, an ace.

1406
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:37,666
Did you find out anything about the boss?

1407
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:40,125
No, I couldn't find out anything about him.

1408
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:42,750
 Keep going. Keep going.

1409
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:46,333
 Oh, no.

1410
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:48,666
My Laila is very weird. She roars with heat at night..

1411
01:40:49,166 --> 01:40:52,666
 ..and turns cold in the morning.

1412
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:05,458
 Babuji. Where are you going?

1413
01:41:05,958 --> 01:41:08,458
Bajrang, I'm in a hurry. I'll catch another taxi.

1414
01:41:08,958 --> 01:41:11,333
 Just a minute, Babuji. I'll fix her.

1415
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:17,666
Babuji? What's this? It's so cold today and you're sweating.

1416
01:41:18,166 --> 01:41:20,208
 Sweat? Not at all.

1417
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:27,833
Bajrang, take this. I don't have anymore. - It's okay.

1418
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:29,833
 It's going to be a good day today.

1419
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:34,750
I received my first fare in the hands of Babuji.

1420
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:39,250
 Start, dear. Start.

1421
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:42,208
Come on. Let's go to Baburam's house and check.

1422
01:41:42,708 --> 01:41:45,250
Sir, Babuji isn't at home. - Where did he go?

1423
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:46,583
 His family members don't know.

1424
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:50,458
 Okay, you can go. This is weird.

1425
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:51,791
 Do you doubt your treasurer?

1426
01:41:52,291 --> 01:41:53,583
 Not at all. He's a Godly person.

1427
01:41:54,083 --> 01:41:56,666
 It's a sin to even doubt him.

1428
01:41:57,166 --> 01:42:00,000
 Anyway, I've to investigate.

1429
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:01,250
 What's his name?

1430
01:42:01,750 --> 01:42:02,291
 Babu Sadhuram.

1431
01:42:02,791 --> 01:42:06,750
 Babu Sadhuram... Babu..

1432
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:10,583
 Oh, Babu Sadhuram?

1433
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:11,625
 What's your name?

1434
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:12,916
 Bali.

1435
01:42:13,416 --> 01:42:14,250
 Whose son are you?

1436
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:17,666
Don't you know my father? - Yes, I do.

1437
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:19,375
 Then why do you ask?

1438
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:23,416
Bali, speak softly. He's a policeman.

1439
01:42:23,916 --> 01:42:26,666
Tell me, dear. Did your father kiss you..

1440
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:28,583
 ..before leaving in the morning?

1441
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:33,083
Had he done so then why would brother be crying now?

1442
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:36,958
Tell me one more thing, where will your father be now?

1443
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:40,250
Sir, why are you questioning these kids?

1444
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,708
 What do these kids know?

1445
01:42:42,208 --> 01:42:45,041
They haven't seen their father since last night.

1446
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:46,666
 Constables, let's go.

1447
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:47,958
 Uncle. - Yes, dear.

1448
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:51,833
If you meet my father, ask him to come home soon.

1449
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,750
 I have got my exams tomorrow.

1450
01:42:54,250 --> 01:43:00,250
Okay, dear. I'll ask him to return home soon.

1451
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:02,875
Look, you're posted here. No one from..

1452
01:43:03,375 --> 01:43:04,666
 ..outside should be able to come in.

1453
01:43:05,166 --> 01:43:06,666
And if Sadhuram comes, then arrest him..

1454
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:09,666
..and bring him to the police station. Okay? - Yes, sir.

1455
01:43:10,166 --> 01:43:13,291
 Two of you come along with me.

1456
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:17,333
Oh, God. They're planning to arrest me.

1457
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:21,333
 Now, I can't even meet my children.

1458
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:29,666
 Sadhuram has boss' bag in his hands.

1459
01:43:30,166 --> 01:43:32,416
And even the police are posted outside his house.

1460
01:43:32,916 --> 01:43:34,000
 And there's no news of boss either.

1461
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:35,416
I'm sure there's something fishy going on.

1462
01:43:35,916 --> 01:43:36,750
 Follow Sadhuram.

1463
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,250
 I'll keep an eye on his house.

1464
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:42,250
 Yes, let's go. - Let's go.

1465
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:57,041
There isn't a single taxi in sight today.

1466
01:43:57,541 --> 01:44:02,041
 Taxi. Taxi. Taxi.

1467
01:44:02,541 --> 01:44:03,875
Sorry sir, I didn't realise that you were calling out to me.

1468
01:44:04,375 --> 01:44:05,333
 Hurry up, I've to reach the studio.

1469
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:06,541
 But sir, this is a big taxi.

1470
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:10,458
So what if it's a big taxi? The film producer is paying for it.

1471
01:44:10,958 --> 01:44:14,458
 Come on, let's go.

1472
01:44:17,166 --> 01:44:21,916
Rajkumari at 10.30, Helen at 11.00, Kumkum at 11.30..

1473
01:44:22,416 --> 01:44:25,875
Sir, which film company do you work in?

1474
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:27,041
 Had I worked for a single company..

1475
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:28,791
 ..then I could've told you.

1476
01:44:29,291 --> 01:44:30,666
I'm in Bandra today, Andheri tomorrow..

1477
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:33,583
..and Dadar, the day after. I've been doing this for 20 years.

1478
01:44:34,083 --> 01:44:37,375
For 20 years. But I've never seen you in any movie?

1479
01:44:37,875 --> 01:44:39,208
 Can you please remove your glasses?

1480
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:43,666
 How can you see me, I'm not an actor.

1481
01:44:44,166 --> 01:44:45,500
I would've become one if these teeth weren't a problem.

1482
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:46,833
 Oh, God.

1483
01:44:47,333 --> 01:44:48,000
 That's the problem, pal.

1484
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,083
Otherwise, even I would've become an actor.

1485
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:52,833
Actually, I'm a hairdresser. You know about it?

1486
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:56,958
The hair of film stars... Dressing. - Okay. Okay.

1487
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,125
 You've a good business.

1488
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:02,666
You touch the hair of women with your hands..

1489
01:45:03,166 --> 01:45:05,083
..and even get paid for it. You get two rewards.

1490
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:07,416
One is the money and the other is the woman.

1491
01:45:07,916 --> 01:45:08,750
 Why are you laughing?

1492
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:10,916
I'm laughing because you're being fooled.

1493
01:45:11,416 --> 01:45:14,333
Do you think that film stars have such long hair? - Yes.

1494
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:17,916
 Red cheeks and lips? - Yes.

1495
01:45:18,416 --> 01:45:23,125
Why? Isn't it so? - Forget it, pal. Don't make me talk.

1496
01:45:23,625 --> 01:45:25,541
Why do you make me reveal their secrets?

1497
01:45:26,041 --> 01:45:27,666
Okay, don't reveal their secrets. Just tell me..

1498
01:45:28,166 --> 01:45:31,458
..how's the heroine you're going to meet today?

1499
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:34,541
How beautiful is she? What does she eat?

1500
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:37,166
What does she drink? Does she travel in a taxi?

1501
01:45:37,666 --> 01:45:39,166
 Why are you laughing?

1502
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:40,833
 You're being fooled again.

1503
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:45,875
I'm not going for a heroine today...but for a hero.

1504
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,666
He doesn't have a single hair on his head.

1505
01:45:48,166 --> 01:45:51,750
 I've to fix this wig on his head.

1506
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:55,291
What have you done? What have you done? - What?

1507
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:57,541
You beheaded someone for the sake of a bald hero?

1508
01:45:58,041 --> 01:46:00,541
 Beheaded someone? What are you saying?

1509
01:46:01,041 --> 01:46:03,125
This is a wooden head and this is false hair.

1510
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:06,166
False hair? I don't think so. I'm scared.

1511
01:46:06,666 --> 01:46:07,958
Along with you, even I'll get into trouble. - Let's go.

1512
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:11,000
You please sit at the back. Otherwise, I'll make you leave my cab.

1513
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:12,208
 I'm getting late. Drive faster.

1514
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,041
 Sit at the back. Come on.

1515
01:46:14,541 --> 01:46:16,583
Unless you go back, I won't start the taxi.

1516
01:46:17,083 --> 01:46:20,083
You're ridiculous man. If I don't reach the studio in five minutes..

1517
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:22,666
..then that bald hero will kill the producer..

1518
01:46:23,166 --> 01:46:24,541
..and the producer in turn will kill me.

1519
01:46:25,041 --> 01:46:28,541
 Come on. Hurry up.

1520
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:35,291
You're the son of this country. The youth of this nation.

1521
01:46:35,791 --> 01:46:39,666
Your body is made of the soil on which everything stands.

1522
01:46:40,166 --> 01:46:41,291
 Prithviraj Kapoor.

1523
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:43,583
I'm not talking about the actor, I'm talking about..

1524
01:46:44,083 --> 01:46:47,541
..Prithviraj Chauhan. He gave his life for the country.

1525
01:46:48,041 --> 01:46:50,541
 No, sir. I haven't heard of him.

1526
01:46:51,041 --> 01:46:51,833
 Have you heard of Lakshmibai?

1527
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:54,041
 Lalitabai? - Lakshmibai.

1528
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:55,541
 No, sir. Which movie did she act in?

1529
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:57,583
 She's not a movie star.

1530
01:46:58,083 --> 01:46:59,583
 She's Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi.

1531
01:47:00,083 --> 01:47:02,583
She's the one who fought the battle of 1857..

1532
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:05,583
..on horseback and killed the British..

1533
01:47:06,083 --> 01:47:07,625
..eventually sacrificing her life for the country.

1534
01:47:08,125 --> 01:47:10,125
 And you. This is what I'm talking of.

1535
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:13,291
If you lose your wits on seeing a wooden head then..

1536
01:47:13,791 --> 01:47:15,375
Look, sir, I'll bump the car somewhere. Keep it inside.

1537
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:16,583
 Ridiculous. - Keep it inside, sir.

1538
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:18,583
 If you get scared of this..

1539
01:47:19,083 --> 01:47:21,000
 ..then what'll happen of this country?

1540
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:24,166
 You're the son of the country where..

1541
01:47:24,666 --> 01:47:25,583
 Where the river Ganges flows..

1542
01:47:26,083 --> 01:47:28,583
Yes, the Ganges does flow, but the land which gave birth..

1543
01:47:29,083 --> 01:47:30,625
 ..to Subash Chandra Bose..

1544
01:47:31,125 --> 01:47:33,541
Have you heard of him? - Yes, sir. I've heard of him.

1545
01:47:34,041 --> 01:47:35,583
He held the tricolour (flag) in his hands and..

1546
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:38,541
..scared the British out of their wits.

1547
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:40,291
He marched forward into the battlefield.

1548
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:44,291
 There were bullets raining everywhere.

1549
01:47:48,041 --> 01:47:49,666
 Hail the soldier.

1550
01:47:50,166 --> 01:47:51,583
Bombs were being showered from above and..

1551
01:47:52,083 --> 01:47:55,583
 ..bullets were being fired from below.

1552
01:48:01,791 --> 01:48:04,291
 Sir, you talk well. Please continue.

1553
01:48:04,791 --> 01:48:08,416
 Stop the car. Stop the car.

1554
01:48:08,916 --> 01:48:13,458
The flag on the top...the skies above and hell below..

1555
01:48:13,958 --> 01:48:17,458
 Stop the car. Stop the car.

1556
01:48:21,541 --> 01:48:25,000
There's heaven up above, and hell down..

1557
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,583
 Stop the car.

1558
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:28,583
Sir, you were talking so well. Now, I'm not able..

1559
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:31,458
..to understand a word of what you're saying.

1560
01:48:31,958 --> 01:48:32,791
 Come on, stop the vehicle.

1561
01:48:33,291 --> 01:48:36,208
 Stop the car.

1562
01:48:36,708 --> 01:48:37,375
 I can't stop the car now. It's still..

1563
01:48:37,875 --> 01:48:39,208
Here, take your money. Take your money.

1564
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:40,375
 Sir, I don't have change for Rs.10.

1565
01:48:40,875 --> 01:48:41,583
 Keep the change. Just stop the car.

1566
01:48:42,083 --> 01:48:43,583
 Stop the car or I'll shout. Corpse.

1567
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:48,791
 Hurry up and stop. Corpse.

1568
01:48:49,291 --> 01:48:54,583
 Corpse.

1569
01:48:55,083 --> 01:49:04,000
 A corpse. A corpse.

1570
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,000
 Congratulations.

1571
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:12,833
We'll send the bride and the groom in one taxi..

1572
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:15,375
 ..and follow them in another. Okay?

1573
01:49:15,875 --> 01:49:17,541
 Taxi. Taxi.

1574
01:49:18,041 --> 01:49:19,708
Mother, even I want to go in a taxi. - Yes, go ahead.

1575
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:21,833
Mother, why don't you take him with you.

1576
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:24,541
Why don't you understand? He'll come with us.

1577
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:28,541
Let them go alone in that taxi. - Go, dear. - Okay.

1578
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:34,375
 Hey, Cabbie. What are you doing?

1579
01:49:34,875 --> 01:49:37,041
Nothing, sir. Have you got married just now?

1580
01:49:37,541 --> 01:49:42,291
Yes. - Congratulations. - Okay. - Sit inside.

1581
01:49:42,791 --> 01:49:46,291
 Come.

1582
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:04,416
 Baby. - Move aside.

1583
01:50:04,916 --> 01:50:06,666
What are you looking at? - At Mumbai city.

1584
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:08,750
You'll have enough time to look at Mumbai.

1585
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:13,375
 Look at me now.

1586
01:50:13,875 --> 01:50:18,541
Wow. Such a big house. How would the people climb up?

1587
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:23,958
Those who have to climb will do so. Look at me.

1588
01:50:24,458 --> 01:50:26,458
Why are you scratching? - Why do you shout?

1589
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:28,541
If the driver hears, what'll he think of us?

1590
01:50:29,041 --> 01:50:30,541
 My baby.

1591
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:33,875
Oh, baby's dearest, I can see everything in this mirror..

1592
01:50:34,375 --> 01:50:36,750
..sit separately. I'm not able to see the jeep behind.

1593
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:38,208
 If we had to sit separately then why..

1594
01:50:38,708 --> 01:50:39,833
 ..would we get into this can?

1595
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:41,291
 Wouldn't we have gone by bus?

1596
01:50:41,791 --> 01:50:43,375
Okay, sir. Then I'll get out of this can.

1597
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:46,375
Whenever you feel like going, just whistle towards me.

1598
01:50:46,875 --> 01:50:49,541
No. You keep driving silently. But drive slowly.

1599
01:50:50,041 --> 01:50:52,000
 My wife wants to see the place.

1600
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:55,250
 What are you showing baby? - The city.

1601
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:58,458
 When will you take me to Ranibagh?

1602
01:50:58,958 --> 01:51:00,125
I want to see the Langurs (wild monkeys) over there.

1603
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:04,125
Look at me first. Then you can see Langurs.

1604
01:51:07,083 --> 01:51:08,583
Excuse me, sir. But her screams don't sound good..

1605
01:51:09,083 --> 01:51:09,833
 ..inside my car.

1606
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,375
 Why are you disturbing her?

1607
01:51:11,875 --> 01:51:13,291
I didn't do anything. - Then did I do it?

1608
01:51:13,791 --> 01:51:18,541
 Baby. Baby. Baby.

1609
01:51:19,041 --> 01:51:20,791
 Why are you nagging her like a child?

1610
01:51:21,291 --> 01:51:24,000
She's calmed down with great difficulty, let her sleep.

1611
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:25,750
 You look forward and drive.

1612
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:29,750
 Baby. Baby. Baby.

1613
01:51:41,958 --> 01:51:43,708
 Oh, God. Both are alike.

1614
01:51:44,208 --> 01:51:46,375
First the wife shrieked and now the husband.

1615
01:51:46,875 --> 01:51:50,375
Look, somebody in the front. Hey. Love birds. Hey. Make way.

1616
01:51:58,041 --> 01:52:03,458
 Are you deaf. Hey you, sugarcane..

1617
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:06,208
 Make way or I'll bump you.

1618
01:52:06,708 --> 01:52:08,916
 I am telling you, I'll bump you.

1619
01:52:09,416 --> 01:52:13,208
Make way. Move aside. They are shameless.

1620
01:52:13,708 --> 01:52:17,208
Hey you village Romeo and Juliet. I'll kill you. Move aside.

1621
01:52:24,458 --> 01:52:25,583
Do you think this is your farm that you're wandering about..

1622
01:52:26,083 --> 01:52:29,833
 ..in the middle of the road?

1623
01:52:30,333 --> 01:52:32,583
You look like Dilip Kumar, that doesn't..

1624
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:34,375
 ..mean that you act like him.

1625
01:52:34,875 --> 01:52:37,583
Many people in the film industry mimic Dilip Kumar..

1626
01:52:38,083 --> 01:52:40,583
..and earn their daily bread. Walk on the side or I'll..

1627
01:52:41,083 --> 01:52:42,791
..beat you to pulp and bring you to your senses.

1628
01:52:43,291 --> 01:52:44,541
 Get down.

1629
01:52:45,041 --> 01:52:47,541
 Come on, move.

1630
01:52:48,041 --> 01:52:51,125
I've seen a lot of couples, but none like you.

1631
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:54,375
Drop us home first and then you can fight with them.

1632
01:52:54,875 --> 01:52:56,375
 Sir, you don't know about such people.

1633
01:52:56,875 --> 01:52:57,583
 They should be dealt with seriously..

1634
01:52:58,083 --> 01:52:58,750
 ..whenever and wherever you meet them.

1635
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:00,583
 You've already dealt with someone.

1636
01:53:01,083 --> 01:53:01,833
 How many more will you deal with?

1637
01:53:02,333 --> 01:53:03,291
 Look, sir. You go and sit inside.

1638
01:53:03,791 --> 01:53:04,583
If your glasses break then your new wife..

1639
01:53:05,083 --> 01:53:06,375
 ..will look like an old wife to you.

1640
01:53:06,875 --> 01:53:11,208
 Hey. What is your intention? Tell me.

1641
01:53:11,708 --> 01:53:15,208
Shall I tell you? - Oh, so, you can speak. Tell me.

1642
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:22,541
 Oh, God, I am dead.

1643
01:53:23,041 --> 01:53:26,666
 Sir, leave this poor man. Sir. Sir.

1644
01:53:27,166 --> 01:53:30,666
Oh, sir. Please forgive this man. Sir...sir.

1645
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:49,666
 Oh, God, I am dead. - Forgive me.

1646
01:53:50,166 --> 01:53:51,375
 Forgive me, I won't do anything.

1647
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:55,208
 Mother, please tell him to forgive me.

1648
01:53:55,708 --> 01:54:00,541
No. Mother...not mother, father...father..

1649
01:54:01,041 --> 01:54:06,833
 Father, you hit me so hard.

1650
01:54:07,333 --> 01:54:09,583
What a Dilip Kumar I've met. I thought he was an impostor..

1651
01:54:10,083 --> 01:54:12,916
..but he turned out to be the real person.

1652
01:54:13,416 --> 01:54:15,291
 What a man.

1653
01:54:15,791 --> 01:54:18,625
Sir, don't tell anyone about what you saw.

1654
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:21,541
 Now, get in. - I don't want to sit.

1655
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:24,833
Here's your money. - But I don't have change.

1656
01:54:25,333 --> 01:54:28,458
Just leave us alone. Wife. - I'm here.

1657
01:54:28,958 --> 01:54:30,208
 Come, let's go.

1658
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:34,208
 Wow.

1659
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:40,583
 Birju. Stop. Stop.

1660
01:54:41,083 --> 01:54:42,416
 Stop. May God bless you.

1661
01:54:42,916 --> 01:54:44,291
 Birju. - What is it?

1662
01:54:44,791 --> 01:54:46,375
 He'll devour me alive.

1663
01:54:46,875 --> 01:54:49,541
 Birju, I'm tired. Drop me home.

1664
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:51,458
 No. I'm going to earn a lot today.

1665
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:53,583
Son, I want you to earn a lot so that..

1666
01:54:54,083 --> 01:54:55,375
 ..you can repay my loan soon.

1667
01:54:55,875 --> 01:54:58,541
For what? - Have you ever paid the interest?

1668
01:54:59,041 --> 01:54:59,750
 Get in, dear. Get in.

1669
01:55:00,250 --> 01:55:01,416
Yes, get in. It's your father's property.

1670
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:04,875
Hey, Don't start the meter. I'm not going to pay you anything.

1671
01:55:05,375 --> 01:55:07,583
Whether you pay me or not, it's a rule that the meter..

1672
01:55:08,083 --> 01:55:09,583
..should be started if there's a passenger in the car.

1673
01:55:10,083 --> 01:55:15,541
Down the meter. Okay, then. Come, dear. - Father, keep this box inside.

1674
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:19,541
 Wow. Okay.

1675
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:25,041
 "My Birju. My Birju."

1676
01:55:25,541 --> 01:55:27,583
Shut up. They sit in the car everyday..

1677
01:55:28,083 --> 01:55:30,291
 ..as if it's their father's property.

1678
01:55:30,791 --> 01:55:32,541
Look Birju, I don't like these daily bickering.

1679
01:55:33,041 --> 01:55:34,583
 Get married to Sundari and I promise..

1680
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:36,583
..that I'll write off all your loans or else return the money..

1681
01:55:37,083 --> 01:55:38,208
 ..along with the interest.

1682
01:55:38,708 --> 01:55:41,541
No father, not the money, I want the marriage.

1683
01:55:42,041 --> 01:55:44,416
I don't want to ruin my life by getting married.

1684
01:55:44,916 --> 01:55:47,000
Neither can I get married, nor can I repay the loan.

1685
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:51,000
 Father.

1686
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:54,250
 Father.

1687
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:55,583
Why are you crying? - If you hurt her..

1688
01:55:56,083 --> 01:55:57,458
 ..sentiments, then won't she cry?

1689
01:55:57,958 --> 01:56:00,208
Stop this car. I don't want to go in this.

1690
01:56:00,708 --> 01:56:02,750
This is the first time that you've spoken wisely.

1691
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:04,583
Don't get married if you don't want to..

1692
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:05,916
..but why do you want to get down from the car?

1693
01:56:06,416 --> 01:56:10,583
He's indebted to us.. - Father, forget the loan.

1694
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:14,583
 He's a very dangerous man.

1695
01:56:17,833 --> 01:56:22,458
Father. - Birjuram, stop the car. I've written off all your debts.

1696
01:56:22,958 --> 01:56:25,375
What did you say? - I don't want anything from you.

1697
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:29,791
Swear on the Ganges. - I swear on the Ganges.

1698
01:56:30,291 --> 01:56:31,583
 I've written off all your loans.

1699
01:56:32,083 --> 01:56:35,541
Tell your daughter not to disturb me again.

1700
01:56:36,041 --> 01:56:37,875
Let alone disturbing, I won't even call out your name again.

1701
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:39,583
 Just stop the car.

1702
01:56:40,083 --> 01:56:41,458
 Stop the car.

1703
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:43,458
 I'm stopping. - Stop the car.

1704
01:56:43,958 --> 01:56:47,333
 Stop the car.

1705
01:56:47,833 --> 01:56:48,750
 Father, run.

1706
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:54,458
Dhaniram. You're not even my father-in-law now.

1707
01:56:54,958 --> 01:56:56,666
 Give me the fare.

1708
01:56:57,166 --> 01:56:59,666
Anyway, this was the best earning today.

1709
01:57:00,166 --> 01:57:05,208
My loans were written off and I got rid of this mount Everest.

1710
01:57:05,708 --> 01:57:09,208
Ganesh, Munni, you haven't eaten anything since morning.

1711
01:57:09,708 --> 01:57:13,375
Till when you remain hungry? - We'll eat when dad comes.

1712
01:57:13,875 --> 01:57:15,458
 He'll surely come, Munni.

1713
01:57:15,958 --> 01:57:18,458
 When dad comes, he'll scold me.

1714
01:57:18,958 --> 01:57:23,958
He'll say that I didn't feed you. Then he'll abuse me.

1715
01:57:24,458 --> 01:57:25,291
 Will you like that?

1716
01:57:25,791 --> 01:57:28,041
Ok, Aunt. Get some milk. We'll drink milk.

1717
01:57:28,541 --> 01:57:32,791
 Okay, I'll get it right away.

1718
01:57:33,291 --> 01:57:37,125
 What kind of a son are you?

1719
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:40,458
Father is missing and you're drinking milk?

1720
01:57:40,958 --> 01:57:44,166
Talk softly, Munni. Let's run away before aunt returns with..

1721
01:57:44,666 --> 01:57:46,500
 ..the milk.

1722
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,500
We'll find father and help him nab the thief.

1723
01:58:00,458 --> 01:58:01,208
 Good morning. - Good morning.

1724
01:58:01,708 --> 01:58:02,791
 Father, the rear door is broken.

1725
01:58:03,291 --> 01:58:03,958
 Get in through this door.

1726
01:58:04,458 --> 01:58:07,041
 Okay. No problem.

1727
01:58:07,541 --> 01:58:08,375
 Sir, where do you want to go?

1728
01:58:08,875 --> 01:58:12,375
 St. Michael Church.

1729
01:58:22,458 --> 01:58:26,958
Father. - Yes, my son. - Father, my name is Bajrang.

1730
01:58:27,458 --> 01:58:31,375
I'm a Hindu. But I believe in the church and mosque too.

1731
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:37,583
You should be like that. India needs people like you.

1732
01:58:38,083 --> 01:58:40,125
 It's a very good thing.

1733
01:58:40,625 --> 01:58:44,208
But Father, I'm not able to understand anything.

1734
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:47,083
Tell me. - Father, sometimes even good men start..

1735
01:58:47,583 --> 01:58:50,958
 ..committing evil deeds, why is it so?

1736
01:58:51,458 --> 01:58:52,750
 It's very simple, dear.

1737
01:58:53,250 --> 01:58:56,500
 It is a very simple matter, my son.

1738
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,500
When he's a good man, he leads a holy life.

1739
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,458
 But Satan never sleeps.

1740
01:59:05,958 --> 01:59:08,500
 Satan never sleeps.

1741
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,291
He's always after good people. And when Satan gets an..

1742
01:59:13,791 --> 01:59:17,291
..opportunity, he misleads good people from the path..

1743
01:59:17,791 --> 01:59:21,291
..of righteousness and makes them lead a sinful life..

1744
01:59:33,958 --> 01:59:39,208
 Sin...Sin..

1745
01:59:39,708 --> 01:59:42,208
 Stop. Stop.

1746
01:59:42,708 --> 01:59:44,000
 Father, why are you stammering?

1747
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:49,125
My son, stop somewhere. - What is it, Father?

1748
01:59:49,625 --> 01:59:53,125
Stop. My son, stop the car. - I'm stopping, father.

1749
02:00:01,958 --> 02:00:03,291
Father, you had to go the church, why did you stop in..

1750
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:05,291
..front of the mosque? - My son, whether it's a mosque..

1751
02:00:05,791 --> 02:00:10,375
 ..or a temple, all are houses of God.

1752
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:13,375
Here, take your fare. - But I don't have change, father.

1753
02:00:13,875 --> 02:00:16,458
 No problem, keep the change.

1754
02:00:16,958 --> 02:00:18,125
 Thank you, father. God bless you.

1755
02:00:18,625 --> 02:00:20,791
It seems the currency has been devalued today.

1756
02:00:21,291 --> 02:00:22,458
 No one wants the change.

1757
02:00:22,958 --> 02:00:25,125
 Hello. Police station?

1758
02:00:25,625 --> 02:00:29,000
I'm Father D'souza speaking. Just now I was travelling in..

1759
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:33,458
 ..a taxi, and I saw a corpse in it.

1760
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:39,958
Yes. Yes. No. It wasn't a small taxi but a big one.

1761
02:00:40,458 --> 02:00:46,875
Taxi. Can you drop me at the commissioner's office?

1762
02:00:47,375 --> 02:00:50,000
Sure, sir. I'll take wherever you want to go.

1763
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:53,041
My jeep has arrived. I'll go by that. I'm sorry.

1764
02:00:53,541 --> 02:00:55,958
But sir, I've started the meter. - Oh, I'm sorry.

1765
02:00:56,458 --> 02:00:58,708
 Oh, I am sorry, I forgot about it.

1766
02:00:59,208 --> 02:01:00,208
 Here.

1767
02:01:00,708 --> 02:01:03,583
Sir, I don't have change. - It's alright.

1768
02:01:04,083 --> 02:01:04,791
 This is the first time I've received..

1769
02:01:05,291 --> 02:01:08,791
 ..money from a policeman.

1770
02:02:56,958 --> 02:03:01,291
 Look there's a taxi. Taxi. Taxi.

1771
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:06,291
Stop. Stop. Get in from here, not there.

1772
02:03:06,791 --> 02:03:11,250
 Oh, come from the other side.

1773
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:14,791
Hey don't start the meter. Chaturvedi, this is a big car.

1774
02:03:15,291 --> 02:03:16,291
You remained a bachelor all your life because of this..

1775
02:03:16,791 --> 02:03:18,375
 ..small and big problems of yours.

1776
02:03:18,875 --> 02:03:21,125
 Accept whatever you get. - Okay.

1777
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:24,125
Just a minute, Pandit. I'll charge extra for the luggage.

1778
02:03:24,625 --> 02:03:27,583
We don't have a luggage. This is just a bag of vegetables.

1779
02:03:28,083 --> 02:03:29,500
 And what about this sack of 150kgs?

1780
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,458
What? How dare you mock at me? I'll Shrap (curse) you.

1781
02:03:32,958 --> 02:03:35,375
What? Being a Brahman, you sell Sharab (wine)?

1782
02:03:35,875 --> 02:03:37,291
You're a drunkard, your father is a drunkard..

1783
02:03:37,791 --> 02:03:38,500
 ..your grandfather is a drunkard.

1784
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,208
Yes, but they all died of thirst during the prohibition period.

1785
02:03:43,708 --> 02:03:44,291
 Come, get in.

1786
02:03:44,791 --> 02:03:46,458
 Chaturvedi, I'll sit in front.

1787
02:03:46,958 --> 02:03:50,458
Just a minute, sir. The springs in the front are weak.

1788
02:03:50,958 --> 02:03:51,583
 Why don't the two you sit at the back?

1789
02:03:52,083 --> 02:03:55,583
 Sit on the backseat. - Okay.

1790
02:04:05,083 --> 02:04:07,125
 Pandit, where are you going to?

1791
02:04:07,625 --> 02:04:10,500
 Ujalanagar, Andheri.

1792
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,875
Wow. What a burp. Did you eat in a marriage?

1793
02:04:15,375 --> 02:04:18,291
Why are you asking? Your burp suggests that you've..

1794
02:04:18,791 --> 02:04:21,125
 ..eaten a lot of the free meal.

1795
02:04:21,625 --> 02:04:23,375
What can one eat in this age of rationing?

1796
02:04:23,875 --> 02:04:26,500
What do you say, Trivedi? - Yes, Chaturvedi.

1797
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,791
It's enough if we get pudding and fried bread. - Yes.

1798
02:04:32,291 --> 02:04:34,208
Nowadays, there are a lot of frauds in this country.

1799
02:04:34,708 --> 02:04:35,375
 They have the name of the Lord on..

1800
02:04:35,875 --> 02:04:36,500
..their lips and knives up their sleeves.

1801
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,875
Chaturvedi, did you hear about the murder last night?

1802
02:04:40,375 --> 02:04:43,125
Murder. - Yes. And it's related to God.

1803
02:04:43,625 --> 02:04:44,958
 Has God started killing these days?

1804
02:04:45,458 --> 02:04:48,291
Shut up and drive the car. So, what were you saying?

1805
02:04:48,791 --> 02:04:52,583
The murderer was a great devotee of the Lord.

1806
02:04:53,083 --> 02:04:57,291
Even you know him. He's the treasurer who used to visit..

1807
02:04:57,791 --> 02:05:01,708
..our temple everyday and sing hymns to the Lord.

1808
02:05:02,208 --> 02:05:06,125
The one who left the temple without praying to God.

1809
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:07,375
 Yes, that same person.

1810
02:05:07,875 --> 02:05:10,041
That's the reason why God punished him.

1811
02:05:10,541 --> 02:05:12,125
From a treasurer, he turned into a murderer.

1812
02:05:12,625 --> 02:05:13,958
 Which treasurer are you talking about?

1813
02:05:14,458 --> 02:05:17,041
The one who works in City.. - The City Cooperative bank?

1814
02:05:17,541 --> 02:05:18,208
 Yes, he's the one.

1815
02:05:18,708 --> 02:05:19,791
 Babu Sadhuram is the treasurer..

1816
02:05:20,291 --> 02:05:21,666
..of City Cooperative Bank. - Even I'm talking about him.

1817
02:05:22,166 --> 02:05:25,666
That man has looted the bank and murdered the manager. - What?

1818
02:05:38,083 --> 02:05:44,375
 Stop the car. Stop the car.

1819
02:05:44,875 --> 02:05:46,125
 Why are you shouting? I'm stopping.

1820
02:05:46,625 --> 02:05:50,125
 Stop the car.

1821
02:05:56,958 --> 02:05:59,041
Pandit, you had given some other address.

1822
02:05:59,541 --> 02:06:00,875
 Why did you stop near the sea?

1823
02:06:01,375 --> 02:06:02,791
 Just take your fare and leave.

1824
02:06:03,291 --> 02:06:07,791
 What's all this? - We don't know.

1825
02:06:08,291 --> 02:06:10,625
 You don't know? - We don't know.

1826
02:06:11,125 --> 02:06:15,041
I mean this Rs.10 note. Hey, look back.

1827
02:06:15,541 --> 02:06:17,541
 We don't know.

1828
02:06:18,041 --> 02:06:23,458
 Oh, God. - Come on, get up.

1829
02:06:23,958 --> 02:06:27,458
 Help me get up. May God bless you.

1830
02:06:38,208 --> 02:06:40,791
I feel that your treasurer, Sadhuram, and..

1831
02:06:41,291 --> 02:06:44,208
..Dilawar Singh were accomplices in this robbery.

1832
02:06:44,708 --> 02:06:49,125
And they were the one who killed the watchman.

1833
02:06:49,625 --> 02:06:52,791
Oh. Now, I've been accused of killing the watchman.

1834
02:06:53,291 --> 02:06:56,000
Inspector, I didn't believe you at first..

1835
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:58,708
 ..but now, even I feel the same.

1836
02:06:59,208 --> 02:07:02,958
All right, let's see. Let's go, Constable.

1837
02:07:03,458 --> 02:07:05,125
 Even the manager is suspecting me.

1838
02:07:05,625 --> 02:07:08,375
I had come to return the bank's property to you.

1839
02:07:08,875 --> 02:07:12,125
The police will arrest me first and then interrogate.

1840
02:07:12,625 --> 02:07:14,291
 What do I do now? My truthfulness..

1841
02:07:14,791 --> 02:07:16,500
 ..and the Lord will be with me.

1842
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,125
 I should go to Agent.

1843
02:07:19,625 --> 02:07:23,125
 I should go to Agent.

1844
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:34,000
 Sit. Start the car.

1845
02:07:40,791 --> 02:07:42,750
 What's this? And who are you?

1846
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:44,500
 Where are you taking me?

1847
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,458
First tell us, where's the bag? And where's the boss?

1848
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:50,416
Whose boss? - Your friend, Dilawar.

1849
02:07:50,916 --> 02:07:53,458
So you all are Dilawar's men? - Yes.

1850
02:07:53,958 --> 02:07:56,125
Do you understand? There's nothing to be afraid of.

1851
02:07:56,625 --> 02:07:59,500
If the boss is your friend, then we're also your friends.

1852
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,291
Moreover, you have the booty with you, isn't it?

1853
02:08:01,791 --> 02:08:03,125
 Is the money in this?

1854
02:08:03,625 --> 02:08:05,291
There's nothing to worry, the police won't..

1855
02:08:05,791 --> 02:08:06,958
 ..even be able to trace your shadow.

1856
02:08:07,458 --> 02:08:10,375
Let's go to the den. Boss will come there directly.

1857
02:08:10,875 --> 02:08:13,708
What? Sadhuram's children escaped from the house.

1858
02:08:14,208 --> 02:08:19,125
What were you all doing? Anyway, the case is now clear.

1859
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:22,291
 Sadhuram had pre-planned this robbery.

1860
02:08:22,791 --> 02:08:25,125
Mansuba, go and search for the children.

1861
02:08:25,625 --> 02:08:27,208
If we find the children, then we'll find Sadhuram as well.

1862
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:28,958
 Go. - Okay, sir.

1863
02:08:29,458 --> 02:08:32,291
Have faith. God isn't so merciless to let anyone..

1864
02:08:32,791 --> 02:08:38,458
..harm father. He won't even let anyone touch his hair.

1865
02:08:38,958 --> 02:08:40,458
 The police are looking for him.

1866
02:08:40,958 --> 02:08:42,916
And I'll tell Bajrang and my brother as well.

1867
02:08:43,416 --> 02:08:46,833
I'm feeling thirsty, could you get me some water?

1868
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:50,833
Why water? You're our partner now, drink juice.

1869
02:08:56,875 --> 02:09:00,125
 Hey give me one coco-cola.

1870
02:09:00,625 --> 02:09:03,791
Give me one coco-cola. - One more coco-cola.

1871
02:09:04,291 --> 02:09:07,791
Hey, give it here. - Wait.

1872
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,500
Catch him. He is running away.

1873
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:49,041
Catch him. - Hey, move. Make way.

1874
02:09:49,541 --> 02:09:53,041
 Move. Move.

1875
02:09:58,458 --> 02:10:02,791
 "A thief has entered your house.."

1876
02:10:03,291 --> 02:10:10,458
 "A thief has entered your house.."

1877
02:10:10,958 --> 02:10:12,041
I'm sure that man has entered this house.

1878
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:14,500
What are you afraid of? Let's go inside.

1879
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,125
The two of you wait here. We'll go and check inside.

1880
02:10:17,625 --> 02:10:18,958
 Come on, Raju. - Come on.

1881
02:10:19,458 --> 02:10:24,500
 "A thief has entered your house.."

1882
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:25,666
 What are you looking for?

1883
02:10:26,166 --> 02:10:28,125
 I know you've come to the wrong house.

1884
02:10:28,625 --> 02:10:30,458
Gullu, the wrestler, lives in the next house.

1885
02:10:30,958 --> 02:10:33,791
Sir, a man tricked us and hid in your house.

1886
02:10:34,291 --> 02:10:35,958
A man has hid in this house? You're wrong.

1887
02:10:36,458 --> 02:10:41,125
Only notes, rhythm, tune, melody, etc. can hide here.

1888
02:10:41,625 --> 02:10:44,125
 Pandit. You're lying to us.

1889
02:10:44,625 --> 02:10:45,500
 How dare you call me a liar?

1890
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,583
Let alone lying, I don't even place a wrong note.

1891
02:10:49,083 --> 02:10:50,875
 Get lost. Get lost.

1892
02:10:51,375 --> 02:10:53,208
 Where are you coming? Go away.

1893
02:10:53,708 --> 02:10:55,875
 We won't leave. - You won't leave?

1894
02:10:56,375 --> 02:10:59,875
 Then I'll call the police. Just wait.

1895
02:11:02,333 --> 02:11:03,208
 Rogues.

1896
02:11:03,708 --> 02:11:05,208
 Brother, who were you shouting at?

1897
02:11:05,708 --> 02:11:08,041
Two rogues. They came in on seeing the door ajar.

1898
02:11:08,541 --> 02:11:10,875
 I'm going. Lock the door from inside.

1899
02:11:11,375 --> 02:11:12,125
 Where are you going?

1900
02:11:12,625 --> 02:11:15,291
 You forgot that I've a concert today.

1901
02:11:15,791 --> 02:11:17,291
It's getting late, I've to pick up the..

1902
02:11:17,791 --> 02:11:18,791
 ..drummer and other instrumentalists.

1903
02:11:19,291 --> 02:11:22,791
Okay, Brother. Good luck. - Wish me all the best.

1904
02:11:32,583 --> 02:11:36,916
Sir? - The police are searching for me, dear.

1905
02:11:37,416 --> 02:11:39,291
 And also some goons.

1906
02:11:39,791 --> 02:11:45,333
But why did you do this, sir? - Don't misunderstand me, dear.

1907
02:11:45,833 --> 02:11:48,125
 I'm innocent, I haven't done anything.

1908
02:11:48,625 --> 02:11:52,000
If you're innocent, then why are you on the run?

1909
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:53,833
Do you know that Ganesh and Munni ran..

1910
02:11:54,333 --> 02:11:56,791
..away from the house in search of you.

1911
02:11:57,291 --> 02:11:59,375
Ganesh and Munni have run away from the house?

1912
02:11:59,875 --> 02:12:02,125
 Yes. - Oh, God.

1913
02:12:02,625 --> 02:12:05,958
Keep this. It contains the entire loot.

1914
02:12:06,458 --> 02:12:07,583
I'm going out in search of my children.

1915
02:12:08,083 --> 02:12:11,583
 But sir...sir.

1916
02:12:39,541 --> 02:12:46,125
I'm tired of walking. Krishna, give me strength.

1917
02:12:46,625 --> 02:12:54,416
 Sir, here's a taxi. Taxi. Stop. Stop.

1918
02:12:54,916 --> 02:12:56,541
 Come on, go inside.

1919
02:12:57,041 --> 02:13:01,791
Pandit. - He's my friend. Get in. Get in.

1920
02:13:02,291 --> 02:13:03,791
Don't get in. Don't get in. - Why? Why?

1921
02:13:04,291 --> 02:13:05,958
 I won't allow this man with the pot.

1922
02:13:06,458 --> 02:13:09,208
 Bajrang, it's an empty pot. Look.

1923
02:13:09,708 --> 02:13:11,625
Pandit, everyone says the same thing at first.

1924
02:13:12,125 --> 02:13:12,791
One day, a man with a pot sat in this car.

1925
02:13:13,291 --> 02:13:14,041
 I thought his pot must be empty.

1926
02:13:14,541 --> 02:13:16,958
Only later did I come to know that it was filled with arrack.

1927
02:13:17,458 --> 02:13:19,041
I had to persuade the cops the whole day.

1928
02:13:19,541 --> 02:13:21,875
 Bajrang, all pots aren't the same.

1929
02:13:22,375 --> 02:13:26,291
This pot is played as an instrument. Play it.

1930
02:13:26,791 --> 02:13:28,833
 Very good. It sounds good. Get in.

1931
02:13:29,333 --> 02:13:32,833
 Come here. Okay, go.

1932
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,166
 Bajrang, did you hear about Babuji?

1933
02:13:47,666 --> 02:13:51,500
Yes, I did. But I can't believe that Babuji did it.

1934
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,416
Whatever it is, I don't know why but yesterday..

1935
02:13:55,916 --> 02:13:59,416
..I withdrew all my money from the bank except for Rs.5.

1936
02:14:03,583 --> 02:14:06,916
Sir, keep this Mughal cannon on the other side.

1937
02:14:07,416 --> 02:14:10,916
This isn't cannon. - It's a Tanpura (stringed instrument). Tanpura.

1938
02:14:11,416 --> 02:14:14,916
Why don't you keep this on your side? - Keep it there.

1939
02:14:24,791 --> 02:14:27,916
Wow. Your mouth makes better sound than that drum.

1940
02:14:28,416 --> 02:14:29,833
It sounds as if you don't have any teeth.

1941
02:14:30,333 --> 02:14:33,833
Bajrang, tell me the relation between music and teeth.

1942
02:14:34,333 --> 02:14:36,541
 Shastri, I'm an illiterate man.

1943
02:14:37,041 --> 02:14:38,083
I was the one who asked you about this. - Oh, yes.

1944
02:14:38,583 --> 02:14:41,541
But yes, I respect classical music very much.

1945
02:14:42,041 --> 02:14:42,666
 Very good. Very good.

1946
02:14:43,166 --> 02:14:48,958
But sir, - But what? - I like to listen to movie songs.

1947
02:14:49,458 --> 02:14:51,083
 Kindly sing a Hindi song.

1948
02:14:51,583 --> 02:14:55,708
Bajrang, the songs these days are so harsh to the ears. - No.

1949
02:14:56,208 --> 02:14:59,333
 There was a time when film songs..

1950
02:14:59,833 --> 02:15:02,833
..were based on classical music. - Yes.

1951
02:15:03,333 --> 02:15:08,291
Then Shastri, sing an old film song. - Old song? - Yes.

1952
02:15:08,791 --> 02:15:09,916
 Let me think.

1953
02:15:10,416 --> 02:15:12,750
 Yes.

1954
02:15:13,250 --> 02:15:18,000
 "The flying bird came here.."

1955
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:23,166
 "The flying bird came here.."

1956
02:15:23,666 --> 02:15:25,916
 "The flying bird came here.."

1957
02:15:26,416 --> 02:15:27,333
 "Came here.."

1958
02:15:27,833 --> 02:15:29,416
 "Came here.."

1959
02:15:29,916 --> 02:15:33,416
 "Came here.."

1960
02:15:45,125 --> 02:15:46,750
 Where is this whistle coming from?

1961
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:48,750
 Didn't you tune the instrument?

1962
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:53,375
If you don't remember this song, then sing another one.

1963
02:15:53,875 --> 02:15:57,041
 You're laughing. Please sing.

1964
02:15:57,541 --> 02:16:03,333
 "When sorrow troubles you.."

1965
02:16:03,833 --> 02:16:05,250
"You sing a song.." - No.

1966
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:09,291
"You sing a song.." - No.

1967
02:16:09,791 --> 02:16:11,416
Don't sing if you don't want to, but why..

1968
02:16:11,916 --> 02:16:13,208
 ..is your voice quivering like this?

1969
02:16:13,708 --> 02:16:15,083
 Are you having an attack of malaria?

1970
02:16:15,583 --> 02:16:18,500
 Not fever. Not fever.

1971
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,333
Is the body cold? - Yes, it is very cold.

1972
02:16:22,833 --> 02:16:24,250
 It's cold.

1973
02:16:24,750 --> 02:16:27,916
 "I am longing to meet Lord Krishna.."

1974
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,833
 "..but I am feeling very restless.."

1975
02:16:30,333 --> 02:16:34,333
Why are you shivering? Are you feeling feverish?

1976
02:16:34,833 --> 02:16:37,083
Brother, I sing according to the situation.

1977
02:16:37,583 --> 02:16:41,541
 "Go, Bajrang, drive the car.."

1978
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:45,500
Shastri, what raga is this? - This is Bhagaat raga (tune).

1979
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,416
What? - Not Bhagaat but Ghabrahat (fear) raga.

1980
02:16:48,916 --> 02:16:54,541
I sing this raga when... when I feel afraid..

1981
02:16:55,041 --> 02:17:00,625
This is the raga I sing.. - It's a good raga.

1982
02:17:01,125 --> 02:17:04,541
Bajrang. - What is it? - Cars are being checked ahead.

1983
02:17:05,041 --> 02:17:06,250
It has been reported that there's a corpse in a big taxi.

1984
02:17:06,750 --> 02:17:07,791
Nowadays, live men don't travel in taxis..

1985
02:17:08,291 --> 02:17:11,958
..how will corpses travel by one? You don't worry. I'll take care.

1986
02:17:12,458 --> 02:17:15,791
Why do you want to go in the path of danger?

1987
02:17:16,291 --> 02:17:17,291
 Why don't you take a right turn?

1988
02:17:17,791 --> 02:17:20,666
Shastri, it'll be a long route. - It's already quite long.

1989
02:17:21,166 --> 02:17:21,833
 Shastri, I'm not able to understand..

1990
02:17:22,333 --> 02:17:23,083
 ..whether you're laughing or crying.

1991
02:17:23,583 --> 02:17:27,083
I'm a straightforward man, I'll go straight.

1992
02:17:30,333 --> 02:17:34,375
"Now, I don't have anyone other than you, oh, Krishna."

1993
02:17:34,875 --> 02:17:40,041
"Oh, God, help my boat cross the river.."

1994
02:17:40,541 --> 02:17:41,458
There are five live men sitting in this car..

1995
02:17:41,958 --> 02:17:44,541
 ..where's the place for a corpse? Go.

1996
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:45,666
 Why can't you say it more gently, sir?

1997
02:17:46,166 --> 02:17:49,666
Why are you shouting? - Go. Go.

1998
02:17:58,791 --> 02:18:00,750
Hey, stop the car. - What is it, sir? Get down.

1999
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:03,166
Sir, what happened? - Come here.

2000
02:18:03,666 --> 02:18:04,750
 Open the bonnet.

2001
02:18:05,250 --> 02:18:07,208
Sir, there's nothing in it. - Open it. - I'm telling you..

2002
02:18:07,708 --> 02:18:11,458
"Till the world exists, the problems will exist.."

2003
02:18:11,958 --> 02:18:13,750
 "Lord Hari.."

2004
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:16,208
 I'm opening it, sir. See for yourself.

2005
02:18:16,708 --> 02:18:20,583
Oh, God. I had taken a tin of paint from my neighbour.

2006
02:18:21,083 --> 02:18:23,750
 It has ruined my ration. - Close it.

2007
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:26,666
Go. - Sir, we are abused by the people because of you.

2008
02:18:27,166 --> 02:18:29,583
 Get lost. - Come.

2009
02:18:30,083 --> 02:18:31,750
 What are you looking at? Sit.

2010
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:33,541
 "Lord Hari.."

2011
02:18:34,041 --> 02:18:38,083
"Till the world exists, the problems will exist.."

2012
02:18:38,583 --> 02:18:40,291
 "Lord Hari.."

2013
02:18:40,791 --> 02:18:43,458
Bajrang, why were you messing with the police?

2014
02:18:43,958 --> 02:18:46,208
Shastri, you're very afraid of the police.

2015
02:18:46,708 --> 02:18:47,833
What can the police do to innocent people like us?

2016
02:18:48,333 --> 02:18:49,083
 Have we committed a murder?

2017
02:18:49,583 --> 02:18:51,750
 "How do I know what all you've done.."

2018
02:18:52,250 --> 02:18:55,916
"Keep going, don't look back. Your family will be inside.."

2019
02:18:56,416 --> 02:19:01,583
 Your whole family will be inside.."

2020
02:19:02,083 --> 02:19:07,750
Oh, God, Laila has betrayed me again. She is hitching.

2021
02:19:08,250 --> 02:19:09,583
 Get down. Get down.

2022
02:19:10,083 --> 02:19:12,833
 Krishnamurthy, come on.

2023
02:19:13,333 --> 02:19:16,000
 Get down.

2024
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:18,291
 Sir, why are you getting down here?

2025
02:19:18,791 --> 02:19:20,750
We've to go much further. - First, get down from the car.

2026
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:23,208
 Why? - I'm asking you to get down.

2027
02:19:23,708 --> 02:19:25,291
 What's the hurry, Shastri?

2028
02:19:25,791 --> 02:19:27,458
Many a great singers have lost their voice..

2029
02:19:27,958 --> 02:19:29,583
..this is just a minor fault. I'll set her right.

2030
02:19:30,083 --> 02:19:33,458
 Don't talk. Take your fare. Take it.

2031
02:19:33,958 --> 02:19:36,208
 Get down. Sir, change.

2032
02:19:36,708 --> 02:19:37,375
 Keep it.

2033
02:19:37,875 --> 02:19:45,125
No. Note it. Note the number. - I've noted it.

2034
02:19:45,625 --> 02:19:48,625
 Note the number? Is this a fake note?

2035
02:19:49,125 --> 02:19:52,041
 No. A person like Pandit Dinanath..

2036
02:19:52,541 --> 02:19:58,291
..who composes pure ragas can't use fake notes.

2037
02:19:58,791 --> 02:20:00,750
Did Sadhuram himself come and give this money?

2038
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:04,375
Yes. And he asked me to keep it safely.

2039
02:20:04,875 --> 02:20:05,750
He said it was the property of the bank.

2040
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:08,083
He said that and went in search of the kids.

2041
02:20:08,583 --> 02:20:11,583
But I was afraid of keeping such a huge amount with me.

2042
02:20:12,083 --> 02:20:13,125
 That's why I came to give it to you.

2043
02:20:13,625 --> 02:20:15,458
This is a difficult riddle. If Sadhuram was innocent..

2044
02:20:15,958 --> 02:20:19,000
..then he could've handed over the money himself.

2045
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:23,000
Anyway, thank you, Divya. Now, you can go. Thank you.

2046
02:20:31,666 --> 02:20:34,541
 Bajrang. Bajrang. Wait.

2047
02:20:35,041 --> 02:20:36,083
 Bajrang. Bajrang.

2048
02:20:36,583 --> 02:20:37,666
 Divya, did you hear about Babuji?

2049
02:20:38,166 --> 02:20:40,666
Yes. I heard everything. Babuji even visited me.

2050
02:20:41,166 --> 02:20:43,833
Babuji came to your house? - Yes. And gave me the money.

2051
02:20:44,333 --> 02:20:46,083
 I handed over the money to the police.

2052
02:20:46,583 --> 02:20:47,375
 But where did Babuji go?

2053
02:20:47,875 --> 02:20:48,541
 He went in search of Ganesh and Munni.

2054
02:20:49,041 --> 02:20:50,375
 They're missing since morning.

2055
02:20:50,875 --> 02:20:51,333
 They are missing? - Yes.

2056
02:20:51,833 --> 02:20:55,333
Get in the car, we'll also search for them.

2057
02:20:57,416 --> 02:21:02,541
What happened? Get in fast. What is it?

2058
02:21:03,041 --> 02:21:07,291
Is your throat dry? Shall I buy you lime-soda?

2059
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:11,291
What are you doing? What are you pointing at?

2060
02:21:15,916 --> 02:21:19,416
Let that poor fellow sleep. You sit in the car otherwise, it'll..

2061
02:21:36,041 --> 02:21:39,541
 Oh, God.

2062
02:21:49,791 --> 02:21:51,708
 "Sing a lullaby.."

2063
02:21:52,208 --> 02:21:56,291
 "Go to sleep, dear. Go to sleep.."

2064
02:21:56,791 --> 02:21:59,750
 I'm finished. I'm finished..

2065
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:02,000
 What do I do? What do I do?

2066
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:03,458
 The man with the beard is dead.

2067
02:22:03,958 --> 02:22:05,458
 What do I do? What do I do?

2068
02:22:05,958 --> 02:22:07,916
 The man with the beard is dead.

2069
02:22:08,416 --> 02:22:10,708
I'm in trouble. The man with the beard is dead.

2070
02:22:11,208 --> 02:22:14,708
 I'm in trouble..

2071
02:22:15,208 --> 02:22:16,541
 What do I do? What do I do?

2072
02:22:17,041 --> 02:22:20,541
 What do I do? What do I do?

2073
02:22:27,666 --> 02:22:30,291
 Bajrang, what do I do? What do I do?

2074
02:22:30,791 --> 02:22:33,500
What are you doing? - What do I do? What do I do?

2075
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:35,458
Bajrang, have you gone mad? - What do I do?

2076
02:22:35,958 --> 02:22:38,291
 Tell me what do I do? - Get down.

2077
02:22:38,791 --> 02:22:40,208
 What do I do? What do I do?

2078
02:22:40,708 --> 02:22:42,750
 What do I do? What do I do?

2079
02:22:43,250 --> 02:22:45,583
 What do I do? What do I do?

2080
02:22:46,083 --> 02:22:49,583
 What do I do? What do I do?

2081
02:22:55,375 --> 02:23:02,375
Empty boxes. - Hey, what are you doing?

2082
02:23:02,875 --> 02:23:05,500
 Bajrang, please stop.

2083
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,500
 Bajrang.

2084
02:23:24,708 --> 02:23:30,541
 Bajrang. Bajrang. Bajrang.

2085
02:23:31,041 --> 02:23:32,416
 Bajrang. Bajrang.

2086
02:23:32,916 --> 02:23:35,833
 Vidya, when are we getting married?

2087
02:23:36,333 --> 02:23:39,083
When will we decorate the house, when will we have children..

2088
02:23:39,583 --> 02:23:43,666
What do you want? - I want a son, no, I want a daughter..

2089
02:23:44,166 --> 02:23:45,375
No, that old man has died... he's ruined me..

2090
02:23:45,875 --> 02:23:48,458
Babuji's friend ruined me. What do I do?

2091
02:23:48,958 --> 02:23:49,583
 Then let's inform the police.

2092
02:23:50,083 --> 02:23:53,500
No. Not the police? - Bajrang, why do you fear?

2093
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,583
Have you killed him? - No. I haven't killed anyone.

2094
02:23:58,083 --> 02:23:59,458
 I haven't even killed a dog yet.

2095
02:23:59,958 --> 02:24:01,541
That day a chicken came under my car, that's all.

2096
02:24:02,041 --> 02:24:03,291
Then why are you afraid? Let's go to the police. Come on.

2097
02:24:03,791 --> 02:24:04,916
I'm with you, come on. - You're with me? - Yes.

2098
02:24:05,416 --> 02:24:07,166
Then I'm not afraid of anyone. - Yes. Come on.

2099
02:24:07,666 --> 02:24:10,166
 I'm scared. I'm scared.

2100
02:24:10,666 --> 02:24:11,583
 Why are you starting the meter?

2101
02:24:12,083 --> 02:24:13,083
Because that dead passenger is sitting inside.

2102
02:24:13,583 --> 02:24:14,583
 Okay, come on.

2103
02:24:15,083 --> 02:24:15,833
 Come on, get down.

2104
02:24:16,333 --> 02:24:19,833
What is this? The door is on that side. Get in from there.

2105
02:24:31,958 --> 02:24:35,000
Ganesh, I'm tired. My legs are paining.

2106
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:36,916
 Even my legs are paining.

2107
02:24:37,416 --> 02:24:40,916
Come on, let's go and sit there for some time.

2108
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:52,666
 Ganesh, won't we find our father?

2109
02:24:53,166 --> 02:24:56,666
 Why not? We'll surely find our father.

2110
02:25:08,041 --> 02:25:13,041
You're Sadhuram's children, isn't it? - Yes.

2111
02:25:13,541 --> 02:25:16,083
Your father is in our house. - Your house? - Yes.

2112
02:25:16,583 --> 02:25:20,083
And he has sent for you. Come, let's go. - Very good.

2113
02:25:25,416 --> 02:25:29,666
 Munni. Ganesh. Don't go with them.

2114
02:25:30,166 --> 02:25:33,166
 Munni. Ganesh. Don't go with them.

2115
02:25:33,666 --> 02:25:39,083
Munni, don't go with him. Don't go, dear.

2116
02:25:39,583 --> 02:25:41,000
 Babuji. Babuji.

2117
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:42,916
 Bajrang. Munni and Ganesh have..

2118
02:25:43,416 --> 02:25:44,041
 ..been kidnapped by those goons.

2119
02:25:44,541 --> 02:25:46,750
Hurry up and stop them. - Okay, but why did you do all this?

2120
02:25:47,250 --> 02:25:49,250
I'll tell you later, save my children first.

2121
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:50,541
Okay, you go and inform in the police station.

2122
02:25:51,041 --> 02:25:54,541
I'll take care of everything. Hurry up.

2123
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:05,250
 Drive faster.

2124
02:26:11,208 --> 02:26:15,958
How far is your house from here? - Not much.

2125
02:26:16,458 --> 02:26:19,958
What is father doing? - He's eating, dear.

2126
02:26:25,375 --> 02:26:31,750
Look, Munni. Bajrang's taxi. - Even father is in it.

2127
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:33,666
 Father. - Munni.

2128
02:26:34,166 --> 02:26:35,250
 Father.

2129
02:26:35,750 --> 02:26:37,666
 My kids. - I saw them.

2130
02:26:38,166 --> 02:26:41,666
 Faster. Faster.

2131
02:26:45,708 --> 02:26:48,458
 Munni. - Father.

2132
02:26:48,958 --> 02:26:50,708
 My kids are calling me.

2133
02:26:51,208 --> 02:26:52,458
 Babuji, if not you, then who..

2134
02:26:52,958 --> 02:26:53,500
..will your children call out to? Don't say such things, Babuji.

2135
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,041
Otherwise, I'll bump the taxi somewhere.

2136
02:26:58,541 --> 02:27:01,708
 Father. - Shut up. - Munna.

2137
02:27:02,208 --> 02:27:07,666
 Father. - Munna.

2138
02:27:08,166 --> 02:27:12,875
 Father, don't worry. - Father.

2139
02:27:13,375 --> 02:27:16,541
Sir.. - Bajrang, what is it? - There is a problem.

2140
02:27:17,041 --> 02:27:18,375
Those children are being kidnapped in the car.

2141
02:27:18,875 --> 02:27:19,666
 Hurry up and follow me.

2142
02:27:20,166 --> 02:27:21,625
 Yes. - Hurry up.

2143
02:27:22,125 --> 02:27:26,375
Bajrang is in trouble, come on, let's go.

2144
02:27:26,875 --> 02:27:32,083
 Father. - Munni.

2145
02:27:32,583 --> 02:27:36,083
Sir, Bajrang is in trouble. All of you follow me in your cars.

2146
02:27:42,041 --> 02:27:44,833
 Father. - Munni.

2147
02:27:45,333 --> 02:27:48,833
 Father. - Munna.

2148
02:27:59,541 --> 02:28:04,291
Father. - Shut up. Don't make noise. - Munna.

2149
02:28:04,791 --> 02:28:08,291
 Listen..

2150
02:28:29,666 --> 02:28:34,916
 Leave my father. Leave my father.

2151
02:28:35,416 --> 02:28:36,500
Father. - Munni.

2152
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:40,500
Munna. Come outside. Come to me. - Father.

2153
02:28:43,166 --> 02:28:48,708
I will not spare you? what are you doing? Leave me.

2154
02:28:49,208 --> 02:28:50,208
 Leave me. Leave me.

2155
02:28:50,708 --> 02:28:53,666
 Mother. Mother.

2156
02:28:54,166 --> 02:28:57,458
 Leave.

2157
02:28:57,958 --> 02:29:01,625
 No. - Jewel thief? - Yes.

2158
02:29:02,125 --> 02:29:05,625
 You are a friend. - Yes.

2159
02:29:08,833 --> 02:29:10,791
 Leave my father. Leave my father.

2160
02:29:11,291 --> 02:29:14,791
 Ganesh. - Father.

2161
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Sometimes forward, sometimes backward..

2162
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:42,000
Sometimes forward, sometimes backward..

2163
02:29:48,083 --> 02:29:50,958
 Oh, God.

2164
02:29:51,458 --> 02:29:56,375
Father, listen to me. Father, let's go.

2165
02:29:56,875 --> 02:30:00,375
Father, listen to me. Father, let's go.

2166
02:30:05,458 --> 02:30:09,291
 Father, come let's go.

2167
02:30:09,791 --> 02:30:11,500
 Babuji. You escape.

2168
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,083
 Come, dear, let's run away.

2169
02:30:16,583 --> 02:30:20,458
 Where are you running to?

2170
02:30:20,958 --> 02:30:24,291
 Ganesh. - Father.

2171
02:30:24,791 --> 02:30:27,083
 Father. - Ganesh,

2172
02:30:27,583 --> 02:30:31,083
 Come, let's run.

2173
02:30:35,916 --> 02:30:38,208
 Where are you running?

2174
02:30:38,708 --> 02:30:42,208
 Come here.

2175
02:30:44,750 --> 02:30:48,250
 Leave me.

2176
02:30:57,666 --> 02:31:01,166
Hey, fight with me, why do you want to fight with an old man?

2177
02:31:13,875 --> 02:31:15,666
 Leave my father. Leave my father.

2178
02:31:16,166 --> 02:31:19,708
 Leave my father. Let go of him.

2179
02:31:20,208 --> 02:31:21,000
 Nab them all.

2180
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:25,000
 Leave my father. Leave him.

2181
02:31:27,541 --> 02:31:31,041
 Leave my father. Leave him.

2182
02:31:39,166 --> 02:31:43,041
 Come, nab all of them.

2183
02:31:43,541 --> 02:31:44,791
 Ganesh. Munni. - Sister

2184
02:31:45,291 --> 02:31:46,500
Constable, take all of them to the police station.

2185
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,416
 Inspector, go with them.

2186
02:31:48,916 --> 02:31:51,333
 Yes. Come on. Get that.

2187
02:31:51,833 --> 02:31:53,708
 Bajrang. You've done a great job.

2188
02:31:54,208 --> 02:31:57,083
Inspector, we're taxi drivers. We're gentlemen.

2189
02:31:57,583 --> 02:31:59,000
How can the goons stand up to gentlemen?

2190
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:01,916
 We'll knock the daylights out of them.

2191
02:32:02,416 --> 02:32:05,083
Come with me. - Brothers, get back to work.

2192
02:32:05,583 --> 02:32:09,416
 Father. Father.

2193
02:32:09,916 --> 02:32:13,375
After listening to the case, it's been proved that Sadhuram..

2194
02:32:13,875 --> 02:32:17,666
..killed Dilawar Singh in order to save his life and the..

2195
02:32:18,166 --> 02:32:20,666
 ..bank's money.

2196
02:32:21,166 --> 02:32:24,041
 Hence, according to article 97 of..

2197
02:32:24,541 --> 02:32:26,750
 ..the Indian constitution, the court..

2198
02:32:27,250 --> 02:32:30,750
 ..orders the release of Sadhuram.

2199
02:32:39,541 --> 02:32:42,958
Friends, in return of the services rendered by..

2200
02:32:43,458 --> 02:32:46,500
 ..Sadhuram, the reward of Rs.10000..

2201
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:50,166
..on dacoit Dilawar Singh is being given to him.

2202
02:32:50,666 --> 02:32:55,125
 Congratulations. - Thank you.

2203
02:32:55,625 --> 02:32:58,500
Dear friends, I'm not supposed to say this..

2204
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,250
 ..but due to the circumstances..

2205
02:33:01,750 --> 02:33:04,500
..when a saint like Sadhuram is trapped by fate..

2206
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,500
..the world watches silently, just like how our dear..

2207
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,166
..Lal Bahadur Shastri had turned the cannons towards..

2208
02:33:10,666 --> 02:33:15,250
..the border in order to protect our country.

2209
02:33:15,750 --> 02:33:20,583
Bajrang has compared me to a person of great stature.

2210
02:33:21,083 --> 02:33:24,916
 I'm not even equal to him in any way.

2211
02:33:25,416 --> 02:33:28,083
I just did my duty and you aren't rewarded for..

2212
02:33:28,583 --> 02:33:31,500
 ..doing your duty. Out of this 10000..

2213
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,833
..I give Rs.5000 to Seth Haridwarilal..

2214
02:33:36,333 --> 02:33:45,416
..from whom I took a loan for my friend Dilawar Singh.

2215
02:33:45,916 --> 02:33:48,166
 Here, sir.

2216
02:33:48,666 --> 02:33:52,416
And I give the remaining 5000 to Bajrang..

2217
02:33:52,916 --> 02:33:57,541
..who is a very hardworking boy. Take it.

2218
02:33:58,041 --> 02:34:01,000
Babuji, why did you give Rs.5000 to me?

2219
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:03,708
Let alone iron, I don't even have a wooden safe.

2220
02:34:04,208 --> 02:34:09,666
Yes, I gift this Rs.5000 to the famous singer..

2221
02:34:10,166 --> 02:34:13,666
 ..Pandit Dinanath.

2222
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,041
 I've understood.

2223
02:34:28,541 --> 02:34:31,625
 Friends, this taxi driver is so wise.

2224
02:34:32,125 --> 02:34:34,958
 I know why he's giving me this money.

2225
02:34:35,458 --> 02:34:39,500
 Vidya, come here. Come here.

2226
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:45,000
 Garland. - Garland.

2227
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:52,625
Put it around his neck. Don't feel shy. Good.

2228
02:34:53,125 --> 02:34:57,916
 Garland.

2229
02:34:58,416 --> 02:35:05,000
 Put this. Not me. Her. Very good.

2230
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:08,750
And keep this money as dowry on my behalf.

2231
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:13,791
 Great. I'm so lucky. I got the money..

2232
02:35:14,291 --> 02:35:16,875
 ..as well as the interest.

2233
02:35:17,375 --> 02:35:21,416
I'll keep my interest with me, and give this money to the..

2234
02:35:21,916 --> 02:35:24,000
 ..taxi drivers welfare association.

2235
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:29,416
 Sir. Give this to Fernandes.

2236
02:35:29,916 --> 02:35:33,083
Where are you all going? At least bless us.

2237
02:35:33,583 --> 02:35:37,541
 "Live long, and live prosperously."

2238
02:35:38,041 --> 02:35:41,791
 "Live long, and live prosperously."

2239
02:35:42,291 --> 02:35:44,000
 "Live long, and live prosperously."

2240
02:35:44,500 --> 02:35:46,708
 "Live long, and live prosperously."
