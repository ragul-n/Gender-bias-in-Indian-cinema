1
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:39,347
What are you guys doing here? Where
did, Mina, Rina and Tina go?

2
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,342
They have all gone to hell.

3
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,107
You have made us sweat in winter.

4
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,174
You make our lives miserable!

5
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:49,896
Lives in the real world friend
and stop dreaming!

6
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:59,112
You nerds just spoilt my day.
It was such a beautiful dream...

7
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:00,762
...it was about to make my day.

8
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,299
Do you only keep thinking
about girls the whole day?

9
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,944
Of course or should i think about you?

10
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:12,310
Girls are a gift from heaven. I
like someane's cheeks or her hair.

11
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:16,887
I like someone's gait, her
eyes or her figure.

12
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,324
By the way where's our friends
Arjun and Azgar?

13
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:23,169
They have been beaten up; and
now are in the hospital.

14
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:24,772
Where did this trouble come from?

15
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:27,212
Who did this?

16
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:32,127
That girl is like a
like a butcher number 1.

17
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:38,151
Look, she has bitten aff his
nose, broken his arms...

18
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:41,932
... and almost castrated this guyll!!

19
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:46,138
She has bashed me every where.

20
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,095
How did you become
Kamala from Kamal?

21
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,819
She kicked me so hard,
every thing was lost.

22
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,079
I was a man. My gender
has been changed.

23
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,210
Who is this girl? Who
dared to do this?

24
00:05:12,343 --> 00:05:16,243
I am the one; speak with me.

25
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:23,963
Yes! There is something about you
that i like! You look delicious.

26
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:28,364
Shut up! I won't toletate
any nonsense from you.

27
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:32,542
Maybe i will eat you up raw!

28
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:36,348
Even the air dare not
touch me; what are you?

29
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:40,276
Wow! I have seen many,
but none like you!...

30
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:44,355
... You are so full
of pride and ego...

31
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:47,533
Without your wish, even
the wind can't touch you.

32
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:52,935
But tomorrow i will kiss
you in front of everyone.

33
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,961
" The heart says go fall in love..."

34
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,840
"... Let your eyes meet a
beautiful girl's eyes."

35
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:49,824
" The heart says go fall in love..."

36
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:54,556
"... Let your eyes meet a
beautiful girl's eyes."

37
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:58,856
" Your open locks and your anklets..."

38
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:04,971
" Your eyes have wounded my heart..."

39
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,850
" Some are Romeo and some Juliet..."

40
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,780
" Some are Romeo and some Juliet,
some smart, some smarter."

41
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:38,367
" This young feeling
is the first such..."

42
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:45,265
" Some are Romeo and some Juliet..."

43
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:49,937
" Some are Romeo and some Juliet,
some smart, some smarter."

44
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:52,464
" This young feeling
is the first such..."

45
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:57,102
" Some will come close to you;
some will steal your heart."

46
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:02,466
" Some will capture you in her
eyes; some will just smile."

47
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,420
" Make yourself restless in love..."

48
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,390
" Let your eyes meet a
beautiful girl's eyes."

49
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:20,212
" Your open locks and your beautiful
eyes have wounded my heart."

50
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:22,047
" Come on everybody!"

51
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:26,711
" The heart says go fall in love..."

52
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,910
" Let your eyes meet a
beautiful girl's eyes."

53
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:36,253
" The heart says go fall in love..."

54
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:40,334
" Let your eyes meet a
beautiful girl's eyes."

55
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,237
" Your open locks and
your ringing anklets..."

56
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:49,136
" Your eyes have
wounded my heart..."

57
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,910
" Your open locks and
your ringing anklets..."

58
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:58,934
" Your eyes have wounded my heart..."

59
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:16,231
No! My son can't do
something like this.

60
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,780
He has done it in front of the
entire college. He's here, ask him.

61
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,815
Mom! - Okay, you go.

62
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:27,496
Mom! Mom! Mom!

63
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:36,784
Mom. I have sung a super duper song
and i am sure to win the trophy.

64
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:43,432
I am sure you will, but right now
you have brought home a medal.

65
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:44,796
What kind of medal Mom?

66
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:49,837
A medal of shame and disgrace.
What's up between you both...

67
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:55,361
... that you kissed her in front
of the entire college? Tell me !

68
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:57,791
It was nothing Mom.

69
00:09:57,883 --> 00:10:06,983
Shut up and listen to me, from now
on you will stay away from girls.

70
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:09,022
But why Mom?

71
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,841
Because i am ordering you to do so,
and i dare you to disobey me.

72
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:15,855
Come on, i have grown up and
can fall in love with anyone.

73
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:20,572
Then it will be the last day of my
life; and you will see my dead face.

74
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:36,944
Don't say that, Mom.

75
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:39,429
Mom, i'll do whatever
you wish, Mom.

76
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:43,169
You are all i have.

77
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:46,325
Please don't talk about
separating from me ever.

78
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:55,584
I swear by you Mom, i will never
again look up at any girl.

79
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:17,136
Dear brother sister- in - law, i have
brought up your son like my own.

80
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,759
I have compelled him
to be disciplined...

81
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:21,383
... so that i can live
up to my promise.

82
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:28,807
I've waited 20 years to fulfill that
promise, so that i can pay back...

83
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:35,915
... with the same coin; and seek
justice for the reason of your death.

84
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:42,944
I wouldn't have been so strict with
Kishen, if Raju had been here.

85
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,892
You all wait here, while.
I drink some water.

86
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:44,989
" Who is he... Who is he "

87
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:08,021
" Who is he, who comes in my dreams,
and steals my sleep... "

88
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:14,984
" ... and increases my heart
beat, who is he? "

89
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:18,287
" Who is he... Who is he "

90
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:31,928
" I am your quest, sweetheart, i
am your love. Come embrace me... "

91
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:36,421
" ... for i am the one you seek. "

92
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:43,193
" I am your quest, sweetheart, i
am your love."

93
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:54,318
" Who is he, who casts a spell on my
mind, embraces me in his heart... "

94
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,770
" ... and makes me crazy, who is he?

95
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:04,437
" Who is he... "

96
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:27,771
" Like a petal of flower,
lost in time, "

97
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:34,779
" Somebody tell me how does he look? "

98
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:42,021
" I am your color; you are my mirror... "

99
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:49,463
" Without you i am nothing. "

100
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:52,882
" Without you.... "

101
00:14:52,894 --> 00:15:00,394
" Who is he, who beckons me, "

102
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:04,889
" Embraces me in his body and soul... "

103
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:11,129
" ... and creates magic
for me, who is he? "

104
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:14,415
" Who is he... "

105
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:36,025
Were you hiding and watching me?

106
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,945
Yes! No! No!

107
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:41,901
I will show you, just wait!
You loafer!

108
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:21,844
You loafer, take this
you peeping tom!

109
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:23,903
Wait aunty, please don't!

110
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:26,114
You scoundrel ! I won't
spare you, scoundrel !

111
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:35,822
Hey aunty, listen,
she was having a...

112
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,070
... bath in the falls and
i went to see her.

113
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:40,084
Waren't you having a
bath in the falls?

114
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:44,229
I thought she was drying her hair,
which i pulled and you came out.

115
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:45,882
And in all this, i turned into this.

116
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:52,436
I see, you both are involved,
and you look a lovely pair.

117
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,350
Aunty we are not involved, i have
seen her for the first time today.

118
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:58,507
I don't even know her.

119
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:02,904
When you don't even know me, then
why were you searching for me?

120
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,257
To see if this was a
dream or for real.

121
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,115
Now you know i am for
real and not a dream.

122
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:20,842
Brother Raju, there's trouble.

123
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:22,025
What happened?

124
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:24,232
All your cattle have
entered the land lord's field.

125
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:25,456
What will happen now?

126
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,980
You will have to give an
explanation to the local council.

127
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:36,805
Sit down.

128
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:42,788
Why are you sitting,
you are the culprit.

129
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,531
My child come sit.

130
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:08,852
Raju, your cattle have spoiled all
my harvest, give an ecplanation.

131
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,070
Now did your cattle enter our field?

132
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:19,204
Sir, first she came, then she came,
then where she went i don't know.

133
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:23,919
Where she went, i went after her,
but she was not there. She was there.

134
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:28,321
Then she came after me. Had she not
come this wouldn't have happened.

135
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:34,297
Sir, first she came, then she came,
then where she went i don't know.

136
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,660
Sir, if she hadn't come first
then she wouldn't have come.

137
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:38,184
Then all this wouldn't have happened.

138
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,208
And our animals wouldn't
have entered your farm...

139
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,232
But sir, what happened was that
first she came...

140
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,655
... and then she came. And then...

141
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,656
Shut up! What nonsense
are you talking?

142
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,280
First she came then she came...
- No sir. She didn't come first.

143
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,900
She had come first. Then i
don't know from where, she came.

144
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:53,824
Oh shut up. First she had come,
then she came. She had come first.

145
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:58,901
That's what i am sayinf, she hadn't
come first. She... - Oh shut up !

146
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:06,536
Raju, your cattle
spoiled my harvest.

147
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:11,807
So i will keep them
for three days...

148
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:16,549
... and sell milk and make
up for the loss...

149
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,607
... this is the verdiet
of the council.

150
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:32,791
You idiot, i have not married
because of you. When will you learn...

151
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:36,226
... to take care of a
cow and a buffalo?

152
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,440
Dad, there are 20 cown, 16
buffalos and 18 calf's.

153
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:44,177
Shut up, just shut up!

154
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:46,803
The landlord has taken away
our liveli hood for 3 days...

155
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:49,539
... along with the milk and butter.
You must be punished.

156
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:52,843
You will have to sleep for
3 days in the cowshed.

157
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:57,905
Makes no difference, to sleep
with you or in the cowshed.

158
00:19:58,076 --> 00:20:00,276
What did you say?

159
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,500
Nothing.

160
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,942
Hey where are you going?

161
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:01,816
Please let me take my cow for
sometime. After she meets...

162
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:04,358
... her calves i will
bring her back.

163
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:07,972
The land lords order is for them
to stay here for 3 days.

164
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,330
The calves are crying
for their mother.

165
00:21:10,423 --> 00:21:13,423
If i bash you up, you will also
start to cry. Now go away!

166
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:22,598
My father never saised his hands on
me, and you dog dared to do it.

167
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:29,532
I swear i am going
to bash you all up.

168
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,060
You will die rascal!

169
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:50,534
Where did he go? Don't
let me get away.

170
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:54,085
Come with me.

171
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:16,149
I know i have done wrong, but i
also know where to seek justice.

172
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:18,928
Don't you dare try to stop me.

173
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,098
Answer me Raju? Why are you silent?

174
00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:58,362
Come on, answer to the landlord.

175
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:06,235
Sir, when i sent my cattle to you.
I thought they were just cattle.

176
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:11,794
In the night when the calves cried
out for their mother, i realized...

177
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:13,732
... i had not sent just cattle but...

178
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,140
... i had separated them
from their mother.

179
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:27,894
God has also given them the strengh
to call out to their mother...

180
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:33,751
... and my heart cried out.
I don't have a Mom; ...

181
00:24:33,996 --> 00:24:38,496
... therefore i can feel their pain.

182
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:41,266
That's why i couldn't bear the
distance between...

183
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:42,777
... the mother and children.

184
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:52,154
I felt i had separated them and
brought their mother back to them.

185
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:56,944
I have finally found the man.
I have been searching for.

186
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,670
I will never let him
separate from me.

187
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:01,214
I will keep in my heart beats.

188
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:08,363
Look Raju, i can feel that in your
emotions lies humanity. You're right.

189
00:25:10,846 --> 00:25:15,746
Dad don't get emotional
and forgive him.

190
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:19,004
He should be punished.

191
00:25:19,443 --> 00:25:24,843
Yes he should be punished, but
what should be his punishment?

192
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:29,964
Keep him as a servant in our
house for 30 days.

193
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:32,318
Without pay.

194
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:35,862
I agree with you, but
you also have to...

195
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,867
... agree that there
has been my loss.

196
00:25:41,026 --> 00:25:44,326
What ! You mean there has
been no loss for me ?

197
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,189
Of course it has.

198
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:51,204
Then listen, you will work at my
home for 30 days without pay.

199
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,541
What! You are not wiling
to accept your punishment?

200
00:25:57,062 --> 00:25:58,362
No! No! No!

201
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:00,629
I am ready.

202
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:11,065
No! No! No! - Why are you shouting?
- What are you doing?

203
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:12,327
Raju!

204
00:26:17,999 --> 00:26:21,399
How dare you refuse
the verdict of the council?

205
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:25,762
Sir, banish me on an empty island
or send me to the gallows...

206
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:30,818
... but please don't ask me to work
at your home or i will surely die.

207
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:36,835
Nothing doing, you will work for 30
days at my home, and that's final.

208
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:40,393
You are shouting again!

209
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:42,947
Dad she has come again.

210
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:48,496
I will hang you from a branch of
a tree if i ever hear that again.

211
00:26:54,877 --> 00:26:58,977
Mom, i have been seeing you over
the years, go to the village.

212
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,310
What is there in that village?

213
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:10,033
I will soon tell you everything.

214
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,260
Greetings!

215
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:39,532
God bless you. Sister Shalini there
is no point in remembering the past.

216
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:44,775
I just can't erase the
pain from my heart...

217
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:46,808
... tell me, has the landlord found...

218
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,066
... a groom for his daughter?

219
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:54,301
You keep asking me the same
question each year, and i say no.

220
00:27:55,312 --> 00:27:57,512
Why do you keep asking
the same question?

221
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:04,260
Because landlord Gajendra's
daughter will only wed my son.

222
00:28:04,445 --> 00:28:07,345
Have you forgotten his tyranny?

223
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:12,717
If i had forgotten,
then i wouldn't be...

224
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:16,844
... coming here over
the last 20 years...

225
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:18,799
... to enquire about his welfare.

226
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:23,321
He has probably forgotten
the crime he had committed.

227
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,788
The time has come
to remind him of...

228
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,772
... his crime, Priest!

229
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:33,196
The time has come to pay
the price of his mistake.

230
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:46,185
He has not kissed me but kissed
the fangs of a venomous cobra.

231
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:48,846
I will teach him such
a lesson that he...

232
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:51,215
... will pray to die but
will live to suffer.

233
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:56,446
Hi sweetie, your wish
is about to come true.

234
00:28:56,608 --> 00:28:59,408
What are you doing here,
you are his friend?

235
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,560
I was, but now i'm your friend.
Give some cash and i will give you news.

236
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,150
Take this!

237
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:12,095
Wow! 10 grand!

238
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:16,808
Kishen's mother has made him
promise that he will never look at...

239
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:21,545
... a girl or tease her. He will
never dare touch another girl.

240
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:23,971
Consider that Kishan
has been locked out.

241
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:27,001
Good news.

242
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,860
There is more news.

243
00:29:31,994 --> 00:29:36,794
No. The news is that
his mother has...

244
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:41,185
... gone to the village
and Kishen is alone.

245
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:42,953
This is a golden opportunity
  for you.

246
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:47,977
Got it sister? Then don't tell me.
       Understood!

247
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:49,992
Now he will not escape me.

248
00:30:04,148 --> 00:30:08,048
" Hey, what do i say? "

249
00:30:11,495 --> 00:30:15,395
" Hey, what do i say? "

250
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:17,217
" Listen. "

251
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:18,368
" Tell me. "

252
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,141
" Will you come with me to Khandala? "

253
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:24,804
" What will i do in Khandala? "

254
00:30:25,904 --> 00:30:29,504
" We will roam about, sing a song,
and just have fun. "

255
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:33,123
" Run, run! "

256
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:42,525
Run upstairs!

257
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,335
Let's switch off the lights and run.

258
00:30:44,573 --> 00:30:47,873
Let the trouble be gone!

259
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:50,353
Let's switch off the lights
and here place ok.

260
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:45,299
" I am madly in love
with you, sweetheart."

261
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:57,412
" I am madly in love
with you, sweetheart."

262
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:08,423
" I can feel my robe slipping
off, sweetheart. "

263
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:49,546
" You are very cruel, what
kind of a man are you? "

264
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,520
" My breath is getting warmer,
see this weather is cold. "

265
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:56,966
" See this weather is cold... "

266
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:03,766
" You are very cruel, what
kind of a man are you? "

267
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:08,814
" My breath is getting warmer,
in this cold weather. "

268
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:11,302
" See this weather is cold... "

269
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:20,051
" My mascara is getting
untidy, sweetheart. "

270
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:31,573
" I am madly in love with
you, sweetheart. "

271
00:33:37,502 --> 00:33:43,902
" I can feel my robe slipping
off, sweetheart. "

272
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:55,994
" I am madly in love with
you, sweetheart. "

273
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:19,511
I am madly in love with you.

274
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:27,431
Where's the girl? If mom sees,
she will throw me out of here.

275
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:30,994
She's sleeping.

276
00:34:31,854 --> 00:34:35,354
She's sleeping. Hey you, get out!

277
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,865
Good morning!

278
00:34:36,946 --> 00:34:38,246
Good morning my foot, get out!

279
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:39,626
Some coffee please.

280
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,071
Coffee! You think this
is a restaurant?

281
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,920
Where are you going?

282
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,130
If Mom comes, i am gone.

283
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:56,125
Mom, mom, mom. - Hey, why are
you bleating like a goat?

284
00:34:56,216 --> 00:34:57,516
It's Mom, she's right outside!

285
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:01,642
Good then i must take her blessings.

286
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,130
Her blessings. Are you mad?
If Mom sees you i am dead.

287
00:35:05,288 --> 00:35:07,188
I have to do something.

288
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:08,384
Let me go please.

289
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:09,652
Leave me! Mother- in- law!

290
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:12,311
Let me go please.

291
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:15,488
Stand here.

292
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:16,865
Don't you move from here.

293
00:35:16,935 --> 00:35:18,035
Kishen?

294
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:21,048
Hi Mom!

295
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,350
Son Kishan, what is it?

296
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:26,335
Why did you close the
door in seeing me?

297
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:28,768
Where did i close the door mom?

298
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:32,081
You were looking so different;
I thought it was someone else.

299
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:35,121
You are looking different, why
are you looking so pale?

300
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:37,427
It's nothing Mom.

301
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:45,035
Mother. Mother. Washerman
Raghav's salutations.

302
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:47,004
Ma'am you had called for me?

303
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:48,949
Yes, i want you to wash
these curtains.

304
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:51,975
I will give my life but not allow
him to wash these curtains.

305
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:55,938
They have become dirty,
and needs a washing.

306
00:35:56,806 --> 00:36:00,906
Mom, we had washed them last year,
go and wash the curtains upstairs.

307
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:03,522
There are so many curtains in the house.
Let this be.

308
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,215
Girl! Girl!

309
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:16,401
Ma'am, there's a girl in here.
Shall i wash her also?

310
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:20,455
Kishan! - Mother! Mother!

311
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,530
What do i do with her?

312
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,267
Go inside!

313
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:33,029
Kishen where is my bag of
clothes? - Which bag?

314
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:34,973
Yes. I think it's below the sofa.

315
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:36,949
There's no box here Mom.

316
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:39,732
There's no box, but there is a girl.

317
00:36:40,273 --> 00:36:41,773
What!

318
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:43,003
No, no...

319
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,126
No mother.

320
00:36:44,196 --> 00:36:45,996
Mom don't believe him, he's drunk.

321
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:48,522
You must be tired.

322
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,633
Mom.

323
00:36:56,397 --> 00:37:00,797
Here is your bag Mom; and you
take this, and this, and this!

324
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,270
You have other clothes upstairs,
get them. - This sari.

325
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:06,494
I'll get them washed mom.

326
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,105
Get my clothes, please.

327
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:12,323
Bastard! Dog!

328
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:15,255
Is this your father's bed.
            Move!

329
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:24,479
Have you seen the "dhobi- ghat"?
I'll show you.

330
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:41,120
1, 2, 3, and there are some more.
- Thank you mom.

331
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,039
There are 4 more clothes. - Yes,
i'll keep them. I'll keep them.

332
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:46,526
Wash them properly.

333
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:50,683
Why are you standing here?
C'mon get out of here.

334
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:52,207
I'm going. I'm going.

335
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:58,273
What's wrong with him?

336
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,190
Mom he's sloshed.

337
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:06,291
I am not sloshed, this is heavy.
Help me or else i'll tell your Mom.

338
00:38:06,473 --> 00:38:07,773
Okay, c'mon now!

339
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:09,361
Give me some money too.

340
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:10,589
Come on.

341
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:13,507
Here take this.

342
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:17,041
Take this and get lost.

343
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:18,417
He's going mom.

344
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,670
Yes, come on.

345
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:24,728
Careful. Careful. What
is behind the curtain...

346
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:29,806
Take this. What is
behind the curtain...

347
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,080
Shut up!

348
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:32,487
Don't you know any other song?

349
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,030
The trouble has gone.

350
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,621
You can be sure that one
more trouble has gone.

351
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,483
Which one mother?

352
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:48,907
Remember, i had made you promise
to stay away from girls...

353
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:52,292
... now you are free
from that promise.

354
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,759
What i am free?

355
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:56,833
I will tell you about that girl.

356
00:38:56,908 --> 00:39:00,208
Don't say anything,
i will be right back.

357
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:02,342
I don't want to hear anything.

358
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,030
Where are you going? - "Dhobi- ghat".

359
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,790
"Dhobi-ghat? What has
happened to this boy?

360
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,254
God, what is happening to me?

361
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,822
What disease have you given me?

362
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:55,937
I see her in a buffalo
and a buffalo in her.

363
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:58,892
I won't spare her, whether
it's her or a buffalo...

364
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,496
... i will scrub her properly.

365
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:29,181
Raju.

366
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:36,195
What kind of a current is
this? I can't get up.

367
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:42,465
Raju.

368
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:47,697
Oh God.

369
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:58,214
Hey!

370
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:03,023
What happened to you?

371
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:04,549
Sir, i got a shock.

372
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:05,971
Shock?

373
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:07,162
What shock?

374
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:08,386
A very powerful shock.

375
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,669
But how did it happened?

376
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:15,840
I was washing her, then she kicked me,
i went and crashed into her...

377
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,900
... and got stuck with
a electric pole and...

378
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:24,928
... i couldn't get up
and that has left...

379
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:26,145
... me shivering.

380
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:27,385
Shevering.

381
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:29,476
Tell me clearly what happened.

382
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:38,796
Sir, due to Meena ma'am i got this
electric shock; good you called me...

383
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:40,536
... or else i would have
been a dead man.

384
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:42,738
What did you do with him my child?

385
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:44,527
That he's got such a stock?

386
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:49,226
If he plays with electricity, he is
likely to get an electric shock.

387
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:50,869
Now, what happened?

388
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,100
Sir, she had come.

389
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:55,851
Again? She come again? - Yes.

390
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:57,088
Oh God!

391
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,798
Get this man out of here right away1

392
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:03,784
No!

393
00:42:04,276 --> 00:42:05,576
This man has got me crazy!

394
00:42:12,186 --> 00:42:20,386
For the time in my life, i got such
a shock. What was that shock?

395
00:42:20,508 --> 00:42:22,508
What has never happened
has happened now.

396
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:27,373
Aunty! Aunty might know.

397
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:29,996
What kind of electric
shock is this?

398
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:35,022
Aunty. Aunty. Listen, listen.

399
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:36,294
Yes.

400
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:41,899
What are you doing?

401
00:42:42,235 --> 00:42:46,835
Aunty i am checking your current.
Seems you have nothing left...

402
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:49,603
... your fuse has blown off.

403
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,072
CITY GIRLS HOSTEL.

404
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,259
The way i stayed back at his house
made him look real dumb.

405
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:03,405
He, too, got you packed up.

406
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:07,072
He cheated me on it, or else
i would have shown him.

407
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,610
I made him a useless fellow.

408
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:15,118
Preeti, like a dog he is looking
out everywhere; to bite you.

409
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,792
But his mother has...

410
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:18,232
Has his Mom let him loose?

411
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:27,180
He is now free to tease and touch
any girl. You are gone dear sister!

412
00:43:27,243 --> 00:43:28,343
What!

413
00:43:28,924 --> 00:43:34,424
Yes, he is free from his lock- out
and will make your life black- out.

414
00:43:35,176 --> 00:43:36,276
No. - Yes.

415
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:41,516
I suggest you lock your windows
and doors, tonight.

416
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,079
This night is going to
be very dangerous.

417
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:47,429
I am going or else i might
be dragged in the danger.

418
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:14,916
" Hey, what do say? "

419
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:22,239
" Hey, what do i say! "

420
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:23,429
" Listen."

421
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:24,592
" Tell me."

422
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,100
" Will you come with me to Khandala? "

423
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:31,479
" What will i do in Khandala? "

424
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:36,327
" We will roam about, sing a song,
and just have fun. "

425
00:44:38,868 --> 00:44:40,568
Which song did you
sing that night...

426
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:46,475
.... i am madly in love
with you. Sing it now.

427
00:44:50,177 --> 00:44:52,277
Help me Tina!

428
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:59,028
Look inside; it will
blow your mind off.

429
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:17,751
Your gang of friends is unconscious.
Right now it's just the two of us...

430
00:45:17,886 --> 00:45:26,986
.... c'mon give me a hug.

431
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:32,204
Where are you going silly girl?

432
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,922
Stupid, girl.

433
00:45:40,186 --> 00:45:45,886
Where are you going baby,
i will drink up your blood.

434
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:49,207
Don't run away Preeti baby.

435
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:52,336
I will get tired. Wait, Preeti. Why
are you running like an athlete?

436
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:56,016
Preeti where are you?

437
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,160
Help! Leave me!

438
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:22,804
Where are you hiding?
I am restless her.

439
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:24,471
Madam Preeti.

440
00:46:25,128 --> 00:46:26,428
I am tired madam Preeti.

441
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:33,427
No.

442
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:34,914
Preeti.

443
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:36,930
Preeti.

444
00:46:37,983 --> 00:46:38,983
Oh!

445
00:46:39,053 --> 00:46:40,053
Preeti.

446
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:43,344
I was only joking.

447
00:46:44,118 --> 00:46:45,418
Leave me. Leave me. - Preeti!

448
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:02,703
Snake! - Snake!

449
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:04,945
Run, there is a snake!

450
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:06,088
What happened?

451
00:49:06,095 --> 00:49:08,095
Raju. Go and see there
is a snake in the house.

452
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:11,782
There is a snake in the house.

453
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:13,583
Save us. There is
a snake in the house.

454
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:14,807
There is a snake in there.

455
00:49:14,841 --> 00:49:15,841
Go kill it Raju.

456
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:17,065
I would never kill a snake.

457
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:20,189
Why? That day you bashed up ten goons
and today you can't kill a snake.

458
00:49:20,506 --> 00:49:24,506
It's different to bash up a goon,
but to kill a snake! No i can't!

459
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:26,107
Now go inside.

460
00:49:28,852 --> 00:49:32,252
Oh God!

461
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:47,703
Dear Mr. Snake, we
are not enemies...

462
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:55,991
... it's a matter of my
prestige, please go.

463
00:49:57,255 --> 00:49:58,855
I will close my eyes.
Go away, snake.

464
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,130
Go away.

465
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,550
See it has gone away.

466
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,075
Did you see? He got
scared of me and fled.

467
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,849
Stupid.

468
00:51:06,867 --> 00:51:09,067
Help me, please!

469
00:51:39,485 --> 00:51:47,585
Well done Raju, you saved my niece,
here take this as your reward.

470
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:55,260
Sir, life is precious, if something
had happened to her...

471
00:51:56,478 --> 00:51:58,278
... i couldn't have forgiven myself.

472
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:24,128
Raju, do you know why you saved
my life, risking yours?

473
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,880
Yes.

474
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:30,851
It's just the duty of the
servant towards his master.

475
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,115
If you had only fulfilled that day...

476
00:52:33,506 --> 00:52:35,506
... then you would have
accepted that reward.

477
00:52:36,671 --> 00:52:38,671
You did fulfill the duty
of master and servant.

478
00:52:39,984 --> 00:52:41,484
But it was your duty for love.

479
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Raju.

480
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:52,110
Stop it Ma'am. Even the sea knows
it limits and breaks at the shore.

481
00:52:52,985 --> 00:52:54,985
Please stop your feet
from going any further.

482
00:52:56,282 --> 00:53:02,182
I may stop my feet but how to stop
this heart, which has accepted you.

483
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:07,451
Please try to understand; i
am a small and poor person.

484
00:53:08,033 --> 00:53:14,233
Your innocence and righte ousness,
is priceless for me.

485
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:20,789
A woman wants a husbant who is a
good human being, who can love her...

486
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,797
... understand her and support her.

487
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:30,201
I have found you among
this crowd, Raju.

488
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:34,874
Love has made you blind, you don't
know what is right or wrong...

489
00:53:34,936 --> 00:53:37,936
... remove this from your mind
and heart and forget me.

490
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,280
I knew this would be your answer.

491
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:46,427
Now listen to my answer;
I can't forget you.

492
00:53:47,423 --> 00:53:51,423
I can finish myself; do
you want to see it?

493
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:53,942
How lovers sacrifice
their lives for love?

494
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:09,066
Don't separate me from you
Raju; or i will surely die.

495
00:54:10,532 --> 00:54:11,832
I will surely die.

496
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:38,893
" I die for your love and
my give my heart to you. "

497
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,400
" I die for your love and
my give my heart to you. "

498
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:55,463
" Please don't forget me darling
and don't go far away from me.

499
00:54:55,584 --> 00:55:00,884
" Promise; that you will
keep your promise. "

500
00:55:00,903 --> 00:55:05,803
" Please don't forget me darling. "

501
00:55:05,957 --> 00:55:10,857
" I die for your love and
my give my heart to you. "

502
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:16,100
" I die for your love and
my give my heart to you. "

503
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:27,291
" Please don't forget me darling
and don't go far away from me. "

504
00:55:28,112 --> 00:55:33,012
" Promise; that you will
keep your promise. "

505
00:55:33,104 --> 00:55:38,404
" Please don't forget me darling."

506
00:55:59,475 --> 00:56:09,475
" I am fortunate to have a lover like
you, picturesque like a dream."

507
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:20,610
" You are my dream, my quest, never
leave me alone and go away."

508
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:26,250
" I die for your love and
my give my heart to you."

509
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:36,890
" Please don't forget me darling
and don't go far away from me."

510
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:42,307
Promise; that you will
keep your promise."

511
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:47,892
" Please don't forget me
darling. Don't forget me. "

512
00:57:08,941 --> 00:57:16,841
" I will be your bride and
you my groom...

513
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:18,899
... i pray this wish is granted soon."

514
00:57:20,476 --> 00:57:30,176
" I can't bear this separation, come
soon my darling, and let's be one."

515
00:57:30,263 --> 00:57:35,463
" I die for your love and my
heart cries out your name."

516
00:57:36,404 --> 00:57:46,404
" Please don't forget me darling
and don't go far away from me."

517
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:52,265
" Now that you have made the
promise you should fulfill it."

518
00:57:52,477 --> 00:57:57,377
" Please don't forget me
darling. Don't forget me."

519
00:58:24,844 --> 00:58:26,944
Finally you broke your promise.

520
00:58:26,998 --> 00:58:30,398
Which promise Mom, you only
said that i was free from it!

521
00:58:30,455 --> 00:58:32,755
You didn't listen properly.

522
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:39,026
Now listen carefully, you
can never marry that girl.

523
00:58:39,554 --> 00:58:43,454
But why Mom? Can't i love someone?

524
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:47,399
Yes you can, but not
with someone you love...

525
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:49,386
... but with the one i tell you.

526
00:58:49,847 --> 00:58:52,947
You will love her only
and wed her only...

527
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:55,033
... the girl who is born for you only.

528
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:58,906
What are you saying Mom? I
can't understand anything.

529
00:58:58,972 --> 00:59:00,272
Do you want to know?

530
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:01,758
C'mon i will tell you.

531
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:27,400
This is your father and
this is your mother.

532
00:59:45,213 --> 00:59:46,213
Mama...

533
00:59:47,528 --> 00:59:52,228
Son, i am not your mother,
i am your aunt.

534
00:59:56,046 --> 00:59:57,846
What are you saying?

535
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:03,442
I will tell you the facts which
i have buried in my heart.

536
01:00:05,207 --> 01:00:10,207
I will tell you your purpose and...

537
01:00:11,894 --> 01:00:14,494
... your responsibility in life.

538
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:18,242
Responsibility. - Yes.

539
01:00:19,543 --> 01:00:21,943
We used to stay in village
Chandanpur...

540
01:00:23,017 --> 01:00:27,917
... Landlord Gajendra
Singh was a tyrant.

541
01:00:28,055 --> 01:00:31,155
He was fond of confiscating
the land of the poor farmers.

542
01:00:33,276 --> 01:00:34,976
Now you have realized your weakness.

543
01:00:36,406 --> 01:00:38,506
C'mon put your finger print
on this legal paper.

544
01:00:43,357 --> 01:00:44,557
Look, Surjit.

545
01:00:45,962 --> 01:00:47,662
Today his arrogance
has been broken.

546
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,350
Tomorrow your arrogance
will be shattered too.

547
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:54,305
Today he has handed his land to
me tomorrow you will do the same.

548
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,242
I can sacrifice my life.

549
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,129
But i won't hand over
my ancestor's land to you.

550
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:05,903
Surjit, it has been my old dream
to make a factory on this land.

551
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:09,868
I will acquire your piece
of land at any cost.

552
01:01:10,222 --> 01:01:12,422
Even if you cut my body
in thousand pieces...

553
01:01:13,341 --> 01:01:15,941
... i won't give you that
piece of land, Thakur.

554
01:01:16,945 --> 01:01:22,445
Look Surjit, a day will come when...

555
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:25,558
... i'll break your pride
and your stubbornness.

556
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:30,048
I was in love with Gajendra's
younger brother Manjeet.

557
01:01:32,473 --> 01:01:36,273
Neither my brother nor the landlord
knew of our affair.

558
01:01:38,971 --> 01:01:45,871
When Gajendra Singh came to know, he
fixed Manjeet's marriage else where.

559
01:01:47,072 --> 01:01:53,272
My brother took me to the landlord's
house to ask for my right.

560
01:01:54,397 --> 01:01:57,197
Sister, look. I brought you
here as you insisted it.

561
01:01:57,692 --> 01:01:59,492
Now you both stay here,
don't come inside.

562
01:01:59,542 --> 01:02:04,942
If you do, you will
see my dead face.

563
01:02:12,254 --> 01:02:13,354
Sister-in-law.

564
01:02:18,994 --> 01:02:21,394
Come, Mr. Surjeet. Come.

565
01:02:22,345 --> 01:02:26,545
It's my fortune to have
you as my guest.

566
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:34,030
Sir, your brother Manjeet and
my sister love each other...

567
01:02:36,479 --> 01:02:41,279
... and i have come
to seek her rights.

568
01:02:41,898 --> 01:02:44,198
So you have come to be my relative.

569
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:49,533
Come sit here, Thakur...

570
01:02:53,123 --> 01:02:54,823
Sir, today if you allow
him to sit here...

571
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,922
... tomorrow he will
sit on your head.

572
01:02:57,633 --> 01:03:00,333
Yes, you are right.

573
01:03:00,995 --> 01:03:03,395
Get up. Get up. - What?

574
01:03:04,016 --> 01:03:06,616
Go and sit there on the floor.

575
01:03:07,078 --> 01:03:08,578
That's the place for you.

576
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,180
Don't go inside.

577
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:16,865
He has bounded you by his swear.

578
01:03:16,988 --> 01:03:19,488
I won't. I will watch from outside.

579
01:03:26,033 --> 01:03:27,333
Come, take this drink.

580
01:03:28,932 --> 01:03:30,232
No. I don't liquor.

581
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,866
Sir, i don't drink.

582
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:40,831
C'mon drink it up. You want to be
related to rich people like us...

583
01:03:41,002 --> 01:03:43,002
... so drink it up. Drink it.

584
01:03:44,109 --> 01:03:45,209
Drink it.

585
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:46,510
Drink it.

586
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:54,750
Drink it.

587
01:03:58,708 --> 01:03:59,708
Drink it.

588
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:01,407
Drink it. Drink it.

589
01:04:06,912 --> 01:04:08,612
Now you have acted like my relative.

590
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:15,512
It's not that easy to become
rich. Here take this.

591
01:04:20,854 --> 01:04:24,554
Sir, i am a vegetarian.

592
01:04:25,464 --> 01:04:28,964
Look, he's a vegetarian.

593
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:31,246
No brother...

594
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:32,965
You fool, to become
rich one has to...

595
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
... drink the blood of
the poor, eat this!

596
01:04:37,936 --> 01:04:39,236
Not will you eat...

597
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:42,906
After all it's the matter
of your sister's life.

598
01:04:44,399 --> 01:04:45,599
Eat...

599
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:30,479
Now he is capable to be my relative.

600
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:35,050
Sir, he will only give his sister
in marriage, but not his land.

601
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:36,382
What are you talking sir.

602
01:05:37,118 --> 01:05:41,318
Why not? He is about
to be my relative.

603
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:44,695
He won't give you that land.
- Really? What are you saying?

604
01:05:45,346 --> 01:05:47,946
Okay, i will remove your
apprehensions, dear friends.

605
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:54,232
I will make him sign on the paper
to remove all you doubts.

606
01:05:55,439 --> 01:05:57,839
C'mon and sign this paper.

607
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,460
No, please don't let him do this.

608
01:06:02,355 --> 01:06:05,755
What are you thinking; sign this?
After all what's yours is mine...

609
01:06:05,904 --> 01:06:08,304
... and what's mine is yours.

610
01:06:08,922 --> 01:06:12,222
And what is your is mine
instead of being yours.

611
01:06:12,455 --> 01:06:14,255
So why are you worried
about it? Sign it.

612
01:06:14,359 --> 01:06:15,359
No!

613
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,151
What are you doing?

614
01:06:23,172 --> 01:06:28,072
Please don't sign this paper.
We don't want this marriage.

615
01:06:28,148 --> 01:06:29,448
We don't want this marriage.

616
01:06:31,373 --> 01:06:37,173
This belongs to our forefathers
and this land is our mother.

617
01:06:38,897 --> 01:06:41,797
Sharda what to do? When children
are in trouble...

618
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:43,196
... it's the mother who cares.

619
01:06:45,296 --> 01:06:49,496
Today i am sacrificing my mother
for the happiness of my sister.

620
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:07,490
Today you have become my relative.

621
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:09,635
Give me a hug, friend.

622
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,146
Go prepare for the marriage.

623
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:18,666
I will bring the
marriage party. Go.

624
01:07:22,111 --> 01:07:23,211
Yes Thakur...

629
01:08:00,986 --> 01:08:03,886
... but the girl i have chosen.

630
01:08:04,986 --> 01:08:12,886
I will make Surjeet's
wife a window tomorrow.

631
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:23,144
The landlord has come.

Catch that boy.

01:09:32,514 --> 01:09:34,114
What are you looking at ? Go.

642
01:09:38,919 --> 01:09:41,819

Brother what has happened?

How did all this happen, brother?

647
01:09:55,207 --> 01:09:57,007
Landlord Gajendra Singh
betrayed us.

648
01:09:58,224 --> 01:09:59,524
He cheated us.

649
01:10:04,948 --> 01:10:11,848
Promise me that my song will marry
the landlord's daughter.

650
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:20,047
The kid is hiding inside;

651
01:10:31,225 --> 01:10:35,825
Swear to me, that you
will bring a day when...

652
01:10:36,055 --> 01:10:41,255
... the landlord would be forced to
marry his girl with our boys.

653
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:47,104
He will kneel and beg for
marriage proposal of our boys.

654
01:10:50,257 --> 01:10:51,357
No, brother...

655
01:10:59,605 --> 01:11:03,705
Such an atrovity! Such
a grave injustice!

656
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:06,973

My life is not you, but someone.

660
01:11:18,486 --> 01:11:20,986
You are not my destination,
but someone else is.

661
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:25,531
Please forget me forever, Kishan.

662
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:30,628
Who is the girl for whom
Kishan left me forever?

663
01:11:31,739 --> 01:11:35,539

The reason is upset.

667
01:11:46,751 --> 01:11:48,751
Now we not meet next one week.

668
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:49,807

673
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:26,959
Even if you don't have you will
now be related to it.

674
01:12:28,085 --> 01:12:29,685
Because i am also Chandanpur.

675
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:31,939
Tell me Raju.

return from Kashi?

682
01:15:13,016 --> 01:15:16,416
Just now. Tell me, why all
this security arrangement?

683
01:15:16,626 --> 01:15:18,626
There was an assassination attempt.

684
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:21,939
I went to Kashi and attacks started.

685
01:15:22,867 --> 01:15:25,067
What? I must chek their
horoscopes once again.

686
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:36,060
Manjeet, carefully look at this
plant. It has been my dream.

687
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:39,909
Now this dream will prove
to be costly for you Sir.

688
01:15:40,727 --> 01:15:42,027
What nonsense are you talking?

689
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:44,867
Not nonsense Sir, but your stars
foretell that Saturn will bring harm.

690
01:15:45,018 --> 01:15:49,818
You will be in trouble because
of the position of this planets.

691
01:15:57,099 --> 01:16:00,299
And even the planet Jupiter's
position is dangerous for you.

692
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:08,025
Be careful with this new venture.

693
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,900
Both Saturn and Jupiter
have entered your house.

694
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,800
To be more accurate the causes
of your bad luck...

695
01:16:17,824 --> 01:16:19,524
... have entered your horoscope.

696
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:27,500
If you spend some money, i can
drive them away, with my prayers.

697
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:30,821
Give me.

698
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:32,204
How much?

699
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:39,800
One million. Half a million.
Thirty grand.

700
01:16:43,011 --> 01:16:47,811
Twenty grand. Ten grand. Five grand.

701
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:56,770
What? Only 500 bucks? Never
mind i will manage.

702
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,914
Daddy i am sleepy, good night.

703
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:08,510
Like i was telling you Manjeet,
this project is worth 300 million.

704
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:16,440
I have mortgaged everything
for this.

705
01:17:18,082 --> 01:17:20,582
And with the help of minister
Khorana of Delhi...

706
01:17:20,757 --> 01:17:23,757
... i will sanction loan of
200 crore from banks in Delhi.

707
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:27,721
You have mortgaged everything?

708
01:17:28,471 --> 01:17:36,871
Don't worry; soon i will be
the richest man in Asia.

709
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:49,510
Already you have enough enemies;
why do you invite more?

710
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:59,800
No one can harm me. I want you
to help me in this project.

711
01:18:00,455 --> 01:18:05,755
No brother, i am happy with
my agriculture business.

712
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:13,723
Once again congratulations. I will
be leaving tomorrow. Good night.

713
01:18:14,745 --> 01:18:20,545
You will never understand
the power of money.

714
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:08,800
I know what i am doing is wrong,
but when you know the truth...

715
01:19:08,914 --> 01:19:12,014
... you will surely accept
this marriage.

716
01:19:47,778 --> 01:19:51,878
O God, hope Kishen has not
taken any wrong step?

717
01:20:25,675 --> 01:20:26,775
Preeti?

718
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,600
So this is your real self?

719
01:20:34,002 --> 01:20:38,502
I thought you were Landlord
Gajendra Singh's daughter?

720
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:40,243
I am not daughter of Gajendra Singh.

721
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:42,591
I am Landlord Manjeet
Singh's daughter.

722
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,805
Gajendra Singh is my uncle
and Meena is his daughter.

723
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,010
Just shut up.

724
01:20:50,092 --> 01:20:53,192
When you had to love Meena why
did you cheat me, you liar.

725
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:54,549
I hate you.

726
01:20:54,773 --> 01:20:55,973
Preeti, Preeti...

727
01:20:56,596 --> 01:20:57,596
Just get lost.

728
01:20:57,792 --> 01:20:58,992
Preeti please listen to me.

729
01:21:00,393 --> 01:21:01,393
Please stop Preeti.

730
01:21:02,076 --> 01:21:09,676
My son let's go from here. The
landlord's men will kill you.

731
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,100
Mummy listen to me.

732
01:21:11,387 --> 01:21:12,587
My swear.

733
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,850
I don't want to listen anything.

734
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:18,458
My aunty?

735
01:21:32,056 --> 01:21:35,956
What! Preeti is Manjeet
Singh's daughter?

736
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:41,500
Yes, Mom, i was about to wed her,
when some fool came between us.

737
01:21:44,591 --> 01:21:45,691
He is the one.

738
01:21:50,915 --> 01:21:52,115
Who are you?

739
01:21:58,742 --> 01:22:04,942
I am that helpless child who saw
his parents being murdered.

740
01:22:05,992 --> 01:22:07,192
I am that helpless child.

741
01:22:12,555 --> 01:22:16,955
I saw the breaking Mangalsutra
of my Mother neck.

742
01:22:20,059 --> 01:22:21,459
I am that helpless child.

743
01:22:27,628 --> 01:22:32,528
I am that helpless child who saw
those atrocities on my aunt.

744
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:37,510
I am that helpless child.

745
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:50,561
O Raju! I am so happy
to see you alive.

746
01:22:51,819 --> 01:23:01,619
God has given me two warriors to
fight this war. Recognize him Raju?

747
01:23:01,635 --> 01:23:03,035
Who is this?

748
01:23:25,686 --> 01:23:33,286
My brother's soul will rest in
peace. God has united a lost family.

749
01:23:34,754 --> 01:23:41,654
Aunty, Gajendra Singh will
have to pay with his life...

750
01:23:41,707 --> 01:23:47,707
... for each drop of tear and
blood he has shed of ours.

751
01:23:49,138 --> 01:23:53,638
No, my son, don't
take anyone's life.

752
01:23:53,823 --> 01:23:54,923
There won't be bloodshep.

753
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:57,979
You mean we won't take our revenge?

754
01:23:58,709 --> 01:24:03,909
We will, but according to the
last wishes of your father.

755
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:05,581
Last wishes?

756
01:24:08,063 --> 01:24:09,763
According to your
fathers last wishes.

757
01:24:10,084 --> 01:24:19,484
Promise me sister, you will
make Gajendra Singh kneel...

758
01:24:19,677 --> 01:24:29,677
... and beg of you to marry his
daughter with my son. Swear upon me.

759
01:24:30,535 --> 01:24:35,535
Thakur Gajendra's daughters
will be or daughters- in- law.

760
01:24:36,074 --> 01:24:37,674
Promise your brother.

761
01:24:39,478 --> 01:24:41,778
I swear on you brother.

762
01:24:42,884 --> 01:24:46,684
Thakur Gajendra's daughters
will be our daughters- in- law.

763
01:24:48,067 --> 01:24:49,267
Brother.

764
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:56,658
This will make his soul rest in
peace. This will be our revenge.

765
01:25:01,437 --> 01:25:02,637
Give me your blessing.

766
01:25:06,747 --> 01:25:12,847
We promise that we will
marry their daughters.

767
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:31,941
Many years ago i found you, and
today you are to part from me.

768
01:25:34,725 --> 01:25:40,925
The thought saddens me, but i'm happy
that you have found your family.

769
01:25:44,443 --> 01:25:48,543
I am just going for a few days, and
i will always be in your heart...

770
01:25:49,815 --> 01:25:54,615
And it is a matter of few days. After
that i will live with you forever.

771
01:25:55,819 --> 01:25:58,419
We are indebted to you for
looking after our child.

772
01:25:59,706 --> 01:26:02,006
Or else God knows how my
child would have been.

773
01:26:02,899 --> 01:26:04,099
And in what condition?

774
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:11,997
The codition of this place is
good but there it would be worse.

775
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:15,592
By now Preeti must
have told Meena everything.

776
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:18,827
They will neither listen
to us nor help us.

777
01:26:21,864 --> 01:26:27,364
When they listen to the truth,
they will surely help us.

778
01:26:39,003 --> 01:26:42,403
It was injustice to your family...

779
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:46,580
... i am really sorry for
misunder standing you.

780
01:26:47,943 --> 01:26:50,843
When i think of it i hate myself.

781
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:54,504
I am ashamed to be a
part of that family...

782
01:26:55,589 --> 01:26:57,089
... that has killed your parents...

783
01:26:57,572 --> 01:27:01,572
Don't think you both are alone.
We are also with you.

784
01:27:17,514 --> 01:27:23,414
" My darling, the days have
come for us to accept. "

785
01:27:25,012 --> 01:27:30,612
" That we will never stop
anywhere in defeat. "

786
01:27:33,049 --> 01:27:38,049
" My darling, the days have
come for us to accept. "

787
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:45,800
" That we will never stop
anywhere in defeat. "

788
01:27:47,636 --> 01:27:54,436
" Yes my darling, love shall
always be victorious. "

789
01:27:55,595 --> 01:27:57,595
" Love shall always be victorious. "

790
01:27:59,059 --> 01:28:04,359
" God is with those who are in love."

791
01:28:06,972 --> 01:28:09,572
" Love shall always be victorious. "

792
01:28:10,787 --> 01:28:12,987
" Love shall always be victorious."

793
01:28:14,643 --> 01:28:19,443
" God is with those who are in love."

794
01:28:53,973 --> 01:28:58,673
" Taking challenges head on."

795
01:29:01,435 --> 01:29:06,335
" We will face the storm
and stride on."

796
01:29:09,623 --> 01:29:16,723
" We sing along together."

797
01:29:17,672 --> 01:29:24,372
" Never to part our ways."

798
01:29:25,495 --> 01:29:30,595
" My darling, the days have
come for us to accept."

799
01:29:32,706 --> 01:29:38,006
" That we will never stop
anywhere in defeat."

800
01:29:39,652 --> 01:29:46,952
" Yes my darling, love shall
always be victorious."

801
01:29:47,473 --> 01:29:49,573
" Love shall always be victorious."

802
01:29:51,075 --> 01:29:56,575
" God is with those who are in love."

803
01:29:58,735 --> 01:30:01,735
" Love shall always be victorious."

804
01:30:02,826 --> 01:30:05,726
" Love shall always be victorious."

805
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,800
Welcome Mr. Minister.

806
01:30:36,074 --> 01:30:37,274
Welcome. Welcome.

807
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:42,416
I got these papers sanctioned
from Delhi.

808
01:30:43,767 --> 01:30:46,767
My friend you are brilliant...

809
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:49,410
... you got me the loan of 200
crore from the bank.

810
01:30:49,442 --> 01:30:51,442
And in a snap of a finger.

811
01:30:51,835 --> 01:30:54,435
Don't forget my 2 million
as commission.

812
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,700
Brother you have forgotten
what i told you.

813
01:30:58,506 --> 01:31:04,706
I always forget to bring
my wife and sons along.

814
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:06,370
But i always forget.

815
01:31:06,850 --> 01:31:12,750
I am not talking about them,
but of my brother.

816
01:31:12,904 --> 01:31:14,104
Listen sister
-in- law.

817
01:31:15,019 --> 01:31:18,419
Your brother killed four
in broad daylight.

818
01:31:20,086 --> 01:31:22,086
It is not easy to get
him out of prison.

819
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:25,464
But i will get him out,
don't worry.

820
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:29,209
Really?

821
01:31:33,498 --> 01:31:35,498
Here have some sweets.
Girls come here.

822
01:31:38,901 --> 01:31:40,101
Greetings uncle.

823
01:31:40,133 --> 01:31:41,433
Who are they?

824
01:31:42,839 --> 01:31:45,339
She is my daughter and she
is my brother's daughter.

825
01:31:45,915 --> 01:31:49,015
I have found two moons together.

826
01:31:49,756 --> 01:31:51,156
I don't understand.

827
01:31:51,749 --> 01:31:52,949
Have sweets, friends.

828
01:31:53,956 --> 01:31:55,456
But what is the happy occasion?

829
01:31:55,570 --> 01:32:01,370
I have been looking for two brides
for my sons, now i have found them.

830
01:32:02,124 --> 01:32:04,224
Will you get your daughters
married to my sons?

831
01:32:04,288 --> 01:32:05,488
What are you talking?

832
01:32:05,768 --> 01:32:06,968
Will you become my relative?

833
01:32:07,025 --> 01:32:10,025
You offer a diamond crown and
ask me if i want to wear it?

834
01:32:10,414 --> 01:32:12,414
Yes, i will snatch and wear it.

835
01:32:14,408 --> 01:32:17,708
See Sir, the wonders of my prayers
and that too in 500 bucks.

836
01:32:18,463 --> 01:32:20,863
I performed the religious
prayer in the cemetery and...

837
01:32:20,887 --> 01:32:22,287
... you are reaping the profit.

838
01:32:22,294 --> 01:32:24,094
And that too in 500 rupees.
You are a miser.

839
01:32:24,144 --> 01:32:26,544
At least give me 1.000 rupees.
- What did you say?

840
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,400
No, no. I said you have
hugged like friends...

841
01:32:29,499 --> 01:32:31,399
... 1.000 times now hug relatives.

842
01:32:31,801 --> 01:32:33,601
Yes, friend.

843
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:37,591
Gajendra.

844
01:32:38,748 --> 01:32:41,348
I will inform my sons so that
they can come here next week.

845
01:32:42,027 --> 01:32:43,627
From my side this
relation is final.

846
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:46,741
I will give this good
news to my sons.

847
01:32:53,844 --> 01:32:55,644
She looks like a flower
from Kashmir.

848
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:59,000
And my girl looks like a fairy.

849
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,600
Beautiful.

850
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:10,800
They are so far from us. Don't
cry and don't worry.

851
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,800
My dear!

852
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:21,000
Oh God!

853
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:26,400
There is something fishy. We
stumbled on getting the photographs.

854
01:33:26,518 --> 01:33:31,418
Ouch! That hurts! There is
something wrong with these girls.

855
01:33:32,744 --> 01:33:42,444
There is something wrong with you
fools. You'll never find any better.

856
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:43,806
You fools.

857
01:33:44,027 --> 01:33:53,727
Stand straight you idiots. I'm going
abroad to deposit my black money.

858
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:55,000
Which bank daddy?

859
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:58,400
How much daddy? Can we tell
our friends...

860
01:33:58,576 --> 01:34:00,176
... that you are going abroad for it...

861
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:05,000
Shut up! I am fed up
with your antics.

862
01:34:06,405 --> 01:34:08,805
I will not disclose to
which country i am going.

863
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,900
And in which bank i am going
to deposit the money.

864
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:17,900
While coming back if your plane
crashes, who will inherit the money?

865
01:34:18,851 --> 01:34:21,351
Isn't it, Dika?

866
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,700
Even though you both don't have a
sweet face; at least talk sweet.

867
01:34:24,887 --> 01:34:25,887
Listen.

868
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,400
I will be out for a week.

869
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,700
Till then you can't contact me.

870
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,600
You both go and meet Gajendra
Singh's daughters.

871
01:34:34,885 --> 01:34:36,085
Understand them.

872
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,000
After i return i will get
them married to you.

873
01:34:39,736 --> 01:34:40,936
We love you daddy.

874
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:46,700
Let that ministers sons come.
I will extract all their juices.

875
01:34:50,805 --> 01:34:54,905
" One unique bungalow will be made."

876
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,400
" One unique bungalow will be made."

877
01:35:00,507 --> 01:35:04,707
" One unique bungalow will be made."

878
01:35:06,777 --> 01:35:07,977
" One unique bungalow."

879
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:14,000
Sir, it's very hot, would you
like some sugarcane juice?

880
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:15,600
Yes we will.

881
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:22,500
Munna it seems the landlord has
called these two suckers...

882
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:27,700
... from the city to get
his daughters married.

883
01:35:27,905 --> 01:35:29,005
Poor fools!

884
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:35,800
These suckers don't know
what they're in for.

885
01:35:37,055 --> 01:35:38,555
The girls will smash both of them.

886
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,600
C'mon tell us the truth.

887
01:35:42,023 --> 01:35:45,423
The truth is this sugarcane
is stolen.

888
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:48,024
Not the sugarcane, but the
truth about the girls.

889
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,000
What girls? Which girls?

890
01:35:50,894 --> 01:35:52,494
Landlord Gajendra Singh's daughters.

891
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,800
But who are you both?

892
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,400
The two suckers from the city.

893
01:35:58,180 --> 01:36:01,880
Not suckers, you idiot, but the
guys come to marry the gals.

894
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,800
What do you want from us?

895
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,400
Information on the gals.

896
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,000
What are you doing?

897
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,300
One is in love with the milkman
and the other with the curd man.

898
01:36:14,324 --> 01:36:16,124
Whoever comes to marry
them; lands in hell.

899
01:36:16,148 --> 01:36:17,748
When he comes his both eyes are fine.

900
01:36:17,775 --> 01:36:19,175
But he leaves will one blind eye.

901
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,499
They come on two feet
and go back in one.

902
01:36:22,038 --> 01:36:24,938
One was found dead in the paddy
field and the other on a tree.

903
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,700
Guys, hold this for a moment.

904
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,300
Don't move or else i will shoot.

905
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,800
You fool, don't be over smart.

906
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:37,900
Brother we need to check
out these girl.

907
01:36:38,446 --> 01:36:39,446
But how brother?

908
01:36:39,824 --> 01:36:42,524
You are the wiser one, you suggest.

909
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,000
I have an idea. We will send
these two as their grooms.

910
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,600
What about us?

911
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:53,530
We will go us their assistants.

912
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:54,900
Means.

913
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:06,400
If something untoward happens,
it will happen to them.

914
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,500
What a great idea, brothers! Great!

915
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,700
C'mon give me the Guns.

916
01:37:11,985 --> 01:37:13,185
C'mon guys let's go.

917
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:14,527
But where?

918
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,800
To Landlord Gajendra.

919
01:37:15,825 --> 01:37:16,825
But why?

920
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:19,600
You both will go as grooms and
we will be your assistants.

921
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,700
No, no, sir.

922
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:25,000
Please don't do this to us.

923
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,900
Shut up or i will pump
a bullet in you.

924
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,500
Kishan Brother.

925
01:37:29,792 --> 01:37:32,692
If we don't go, they
will kill us now...

926
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:35,400
... and if we go with them,
we will die later.

927
01:37:35,515 --> 01:37:36,715
So what we do.

928
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:38,016
Let's die later.

929
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,800
Should we go? - Let's go.

930
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:03,600
Wipe your tears, and welcome
them with flowers.

931
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:09,300
If they create any scene then.
I will be harsh with them.

932
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:21,400
We have finally come.

933
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:31,400
Wow! Sir, what handsome
grooms you have selected.

934
01:38:35,929 --> 01:38:38,629
Greetings everyone.

935
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:48,400
Minister Khurana's sons Mr. Raju
and Mr. Kishen Khurana are here.

936
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,400
Let's go.

937
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,800
Welcome my brave hearts. I have not
waited so long for the sun to rise...

938
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:10,917

939
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,600
Come. Come.

940
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,000
Shower the flowers.
Shower the flowers.

941
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,640
Come.

942
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:30,400
Please sit. My daughters are
so happy to see you both...

943
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:33,700
... as if they have known
you for years.

944
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:37,600
Father in law, we get married to
someone who is ours for eternity.

945
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:41,900
Even we feel the same way.

946
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,700
My dear won't you offer
them something to eat.

947
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:49,900
Of course.

948
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,800
Child, give them something.

949
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,500
Hello.

950
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:08,601

951
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,700
Hello Minister Khurana.

952

Have my boys reached there?

953
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:20,700
Where have you been hiding
such lovely boys of yours?

954
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,100
You also hid two lovely
moons from me.

955
01:40:23,645 --> 01:40:26,145
Did your daughters like my sons?

956
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:31,800
Both have mixed up so well, as if
they know each other long back...

957
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:36,042
That's great! My problem is solved.

958
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:40,000
But what about my
brother in laws problem?

959
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:45,400
It's done, he will be
released tomorrow.

960
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,600
Come and take him with you.

961
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,400
Darling your brother
is being released...

962
01:40:50,601 --> 01:40:52,501
... we must leave for
the city immediately.

963
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,000
Thank you God.

964
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:55,300

Talk to him.

967
01:40:59,215 --> 01:41:00,415
Let the assistant speak.

968
01:41:02,565 --> 01:41:03,565
Hello.

969
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,500
Why? You don't want to
speak with your daddy?

970
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:11,800
We have spoken a lot with him and
now we want to speak with you.

971
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:13,500
What?

972
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,800
We want to know you and
your daughters better.

973
01:41:16,959 --> 01:41:18,759
Alright. Alright.

974
01:41:18,928 --> 01:41:21,428
Everything is alright here. Bye.

975
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:29,412
Look son. I am going to the city
to bring my brother in law.

976
01:41:29,859 --> 01:41:34,059
We have to leave and will be back
tomorrow. Take care of them.

977
01:41:34,119 --> 01:41:37,419
We are ready to take care
of them for a lifetime.

978
01:41:37,844 --> 01:41:38,944
Very good.

979
01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:40,467
Can we go now?
- Let's go.

980
01:41:44,670 --> 01:41:45,970
Where are you both going?

981
01:41:46,528 --> 01:41:47,528
To see the room.

982
01:41:47,733 --> 01:41:51,533
You both are servants, go
sleep in the cowshed.

983
01:41:51,687 --> 01:41:53,387
In the cowshed.
- We have to sleep there.

984
01:42:00,598 --> 01:42:03,798
We are servants. And servants
sleep in cowshed.

985
01:42:03,853 --> 01:42:05,153
Where is the cowshed?

986
01:42:20,557 --> 01:42:21,757
You hit me?

987
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:26,110
Not hit you, but to wake you up.
You have come here to spy or sleep?

988
01:42:27,617 --> 01:42:31,617
We have news that your gals are
going to meet their lovers tonight.

989
01:42:31,853 --> 01:42:33,153
When, why and where?

990
01:42:33,775 --> 01:42:35,075
At midnight.

991
01:42:40,946 --> 01:42:42,746

992
01:42:43,606 --> 01:42:46,806
" My lover has come."

993
01:42:52,837 --> 01:42:56,437
" Bringing some news on love."

994
01:43:18,602 --> 01:43:23,602
" The rhythm is from Nanital and

" It's time for us to unite in love."

1004
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:46,486
" The heart beat says."

1005
01:44:47,759 --> 01:44:49,759
" It's getting impatient."

1006
01:44:51,533 --> 01:44:53,633
" The cool breeze blows."

1007
01:44:54,823 --> 01:44:57,123
" Letting off a sweet fragrance."

1008
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,760
" There is no one here."

1009
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:04,500
" Take me in your arms."

1010
01:45:05,786 --> 01:45:11,786
" The rhythm is from Nanital and

1011
01:45:13,564 --> 01:45:18,664

" C'mon lets dance in joy
and celebrate our love."

1013
01:45:48,818 --> 01:45:51,418
" There isn't a lover like him."

1014
01:45:52,511 --> 01:45:54,711
" There isn't a lover like her."

1015
01:45:55,911 --> 01:45:58,711
" There isn't a poem like this."

1016
01:45:59,694 --> 01:46:01,794
" There isn't a lover like this."

1017
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:09,100
" Some may not believe,
some may not know."

1018
01:46:10,512 --> 01:46:12,812
" There is nothing to fear this world."

1019
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,400
" We are old time lovers."

1020
01:46:17,924 --> 01:46:23,724
" The best of the kisses
is the kiss on the lips."

1021
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:30,800
" C'mon lets dance in joy
and celebrate our love."

1022
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:38,000
" C'mon lets dance in joy
and celebrate our love."

the rest is from Taliya."

1024
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:52,420
" C'mon lets dance in joy
and celebrate our love."

1025
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:59,500
" C'mon lets dance in joy
and celebrate our love."

1026
01:47:01,465 --> 01:47:04,465
" My lover has come."

1027
01:47:08,511 --> 01:47:12,011
" Bringing some news on love."

1028
01:47:18,945 --> 01:47:20,445
Get aside, man with long hair.

1029
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,000
You two?

1030
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:26,100
Yes, us.

1031
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,100
You made a fool of us?

1032
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:30,600
Did we have to?

1033
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,700
What do you mean?

1034
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:33,300
Is there any need to
make a fool of you?

1035
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:34,600
You both are born fools.

1036
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,000
They turned out to be ruffians.

1037
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,900
How dare you romance with our
fiances? And dance with them?

1038
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,300
Leave me, friend.

1039
01:47:43,512 --> 01:47:44,712
We both are their real lovers.

1040
01:47:44,907 --> 01:47:47,107
We will not spare your lives.

1041
01:47:53,514 --> 01:47:54,514
Don't shoot.

1042
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:59,000
Tell us, shall we dump your bodies
in the field or up the tree?

1043
01:48:01,504 --> 01:48:08,404
I came from cemetery after doing
religious prayer. Who fired a shot?

1044
01:48:13,475 --> 01:48:15,975
You both are impostors.

1045
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,700
But who will believe you?

1046
01:48:18,772 --> 01:48:19,972
Let my daddy come.

1047
01:48:20,491 --> 01:48:25,691
Your daddy is abroad, and till
then we will marry them.

1048
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:32,700
I will count till five, leave
this village or die.

1049
01:48:32,818 --> 01:48:34,718
Will he really shoot us?
- How can he do that?

1050
01:48:40,901 --> 01:48:43,801
So this is the twist in the story.

1051
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:04,000
Sister.

1052
01:49:04,535 --> 01:49:06,035
My dear brother in law.

1053
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:28,700
Did anyone see us?
- No, brother.

1054
01:49:32,119 --> 01:49:37,419
Brother they have cheated us...

1055
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:41,604
... and will marry our gals.

1056
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:44,620
They will become mothers and
we will play with their kids.

1057
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:50,900
Shut up, you oaf! We will
make them pregnant tonight.

1058
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:15,700
C'mon you sugarcane boys,
let's have some fun.

1059
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,700
Run.
- Let's hide.

1060
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,920
Brother.
- Dika.

1061
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,400
Leave us.
- We won't leave you.

1062
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:59,700
Help. - Leave us.
- No, i won't.

1063
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:08,000
Save us. - Brother, hurry up. They
are getting away. - Catch them.

1064
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,100
Don't beat us.
- Don't come ahead.

1065
01:51:39,621 --> 01:51:41,521
What is happening in my house?

1066
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:45,400
Thakur uncle.
- Thakur uncle.

1067
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,200
I fell down.
- Get up.

1068
01:51:52,029 --> 01:51:55,529
Uncle, your daughters
must get married to us.

1069
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,300
Because we are the real grooms
of your daughters, uncle.

1070
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,400
Idiots how dare you suggest this.
You are just a servant.

1071
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:07,000
No, uncle we are not servants.

1072
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,800
We are minister's sons. I
am Dum Dum. I am Diga Diga.

1073
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,400
They were caught red handed.
Now they are making excuses.

1074
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,400
Both of them tried to
molest your daughters.

1075
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:21,500
No, no. - You tried
to harm my nieces.

1076
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:23,000
I will kill you both.

1077
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,400
Stop it.

1078
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:30,000
Yes, daddy they came into our room.

1079
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:32,600
Yes we did because we
are the real grooms.

1080
01:52:32,700 --> 01:52:36,400
They are not the real grooms.

1081
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:38,700
We can also prove we are
the minister's sons.

1082
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,800
We are the minister's sons.

1083
01:52:40,806 --> 01:52:44,906
We are the minister's sons.

1084
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,800
Shut up! What proof do you have?

1085
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:52,500
Get us our bag; we have our
parents' photos in there.

1086
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,380
Now truth will be exposed.

1087
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,900
Meena go and get it.

1088
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:02,300
No, let it is our bag. We will
get it. Right, Diga Diga.

1089
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:07,510
Dum Dum, go and bring the bag.
- I will get it and show it.

1090
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:25,000
Is this your bag?
- This is 100% our bag.

1091
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,500
Are you sure these
are your parents?

1092
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:42,500
Yes they are, now do
you understand?

1093
01:53:44,802 --> 01:53:46,502
You both are his son?

1094
01:53:46,804 --> 01:53:49,004
Why are you repeating the question?

1095
01:53:49,108 --> 01:53:53,408
Are you sure he is your father?
- Do you think he is their father.

1096
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:58,900
You son of a farmer, how
dare you enter my house?

1097
01:53:59,065 --> 01:54:00,665
Farmer. Who is the farmer?

1098
01:54:00,728 --> 01:54:03,328
But our father is a minister.

1099
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:04,600
Stop this drama.

1100
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:10,100
They're children of your old enemy
and have come to avenge them selves.

1101
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:12,500
What kind of revenge, sir?

1102
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:17,600
Yes, they tore our clothes saying
we will avenge our selves.

1103
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:20,500
I will disgrace the honour
of your family.

1104
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:25,700
My hands have been itching
to bash up somebody.

1105
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:33,000
I could find anyone in
prison. But today...

1106
01:54:38,015 --> 01:54:40,015
What are you doing? - Get aside.

1107
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:03,300
No, Sir, don't shoot. It's been a
tradition at your place to sacrifice.

1108
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:06,550
Two goats before an
auspicious occasion.

1109
01:55:06,707 --> 01:55:10,007
The day we get married, you
may sacrifice these two.

1110
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:12,000
He is absolutely right.

1111
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:14,500
They will be punished and
the Goddess will be pleased.

1112
01:55:14,844 --> 01:55:16,844
Thakur. Thakur.

1113
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:23,600
Sir, i have finally identified
your enemy.

1114
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,900
I will tell them everything that i
heard near that ruined building.

1115
01:55:29,033 --> 01:55:31,933
I know who are Saturn and Jupiter.

1116
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:35,000
Who is the friend and
who is the enemy?

1117
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,900
I will expose all the secrets.
I will reveal everything.

1118
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:41,000
I will tell who is true
and who is a liar.

1119
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:44,500
Pundit, don't drag the
issue. Speak fast.

1120
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,200
I don't want to speak but i want
to tell you something, Thakur.

1121
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:50,900
Taday i will reveal your enemies
hiding place and after...

1122
01:55:51,078 --> 01:55:52,978
... that you will be profited.

1123
01:55:53,071 --> 01:55:54,471
Speak up, fast.
- Thakur!

1124
01:55:54,819 --> 01:55:56,819
I can know a person just
by looking at his face.

1125
01:55:56,983 --> 01:55:59,183
I can catch the thirf
by looking at his shadow.

1126
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:03,600
I can catch a bird
just by its sound.

1127
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,800
I have caught them from
the east, west and north.

1128
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:09,300
Here catch it from the south.

1129
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,400
I have caught it, Thakur.

1130
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,800
Wow! What a catch!

1131
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:15,700
Tell me what you have caught?

1132
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:17,100
I have caught...

1133
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:20,900
Caught!

1134
01:56:26,828 --> 01:56:32,828
I think he has apilepsy. Make
him sniff a shoe or a sandal.

1135
01:56:36,916 --> 01:56:41,716
I think he's done for good.
Let's cremate him.

1136
01:56:47,701 --> 01:56:48,901
What do you want to day?

1137
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:59,700
He has blown his whistle.

1138
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:05,700
We have to take him to the city
hospital to cure his condition.

1139
01:57:05,867 --> 01:57:08,067
Come. - It can be only cured
in the city hospital.

1140
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,800
What should i do with
these cartoons?

1141
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:20,600
Lock them up in the cellar and
release them on the wedding day.

1142
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:41,700
What are you saying?

1143
01:57:57,994 --> 01:57:59,094
Here write on this.

1144
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:14,300
Thakur, Raju and Kishen
are inpostors.

1145
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:20,100
Their servants are the real groom
and sons of minister Khurana.

1146
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:25,500
This Raju and Kishan
are Surjeets sons.

1147
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:31,900
They want to marry your daughters
and take revenge from you.

1148
01:58:33,500 --> 01:58:38,500
Thakur, become wise and save your
daughter from Raju and Kishan...

1149
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:42,000
... or else the prestige of your
family will be disgraced.

1150
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,900
Seems you are not satisfied
with the hospital services.

1151
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:51,600
Maybe the shock treatment
needs to be given again.

1152
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,500
Not shock but hot treatment.

1153
01:58:54,600 --> 01:59:00,400
Come here sister. We have
called you sister.

1154
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:02,200
The hospital calls you sister.

1155
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,500
Yes.

1156
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:06,100
But do you know what this
man thinks of you?

1157
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,500
No.

1158
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,600
I can't read Hindi.

1159
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:16,800
I will read it for you. You read.

1160
01:59:19,423 --> 01:59:20,623
Good hand writing.

1161
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:24,700
O my darling, i am in love with you.

1162
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:27,400
Why don't you take
up a night shift?

1163
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:33,900
Everyone is asleep at night and
you can take me in your arms.

1164
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:47,000
See the love letter he has written.

1165
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,000
Beat him up.

1166
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:24,400
From the time you have come, my
house is full of happiness...

1167
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:27,200
... don't leave me and go away.

1168
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,100
How can we leave you father in law?

1169
02:00:29,541 --> 02:00:32,541
Father in law your shadow
may leave you but not us.

1170
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:39,500
May i suggest something
brother in law. - Yes, sure.

1171
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:42,500
You have a big factory.
Give me a small partner ship.

1172
02:00:42,730 --> 02:00:44,730
Arjun Singh, stay in your limits.

1173
02:00:44,921 --> 02:00:51,921
Why? He has millions; a few
thousands wouldn't matter to him.

1174
02:00:52,119 --> 02:00:57,019
Do you know how much debt he is in?
He has mortgaget everything.

1175
02:00:57,156 --> 02:01:00,456
Yes, and you haven't returned my
money. What have you done for me?

1176
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:04,300
On your saying i killed
four people...

1177
02:01:04,519 --> 02:01:09,119
... and spent two and
a half years in jail.

1178
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:13,600
So you want me to pay you
for your term in jail.

1179
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:20,900
You should be ashamed of yourself,
say sorry to your brother in law.

1180
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,100
I am sorry.

1181
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,800
I made a mistake.

1182
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:34,400
You are not sorry; you have spoken
what was in your heart. Get out!

1183
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:39,400
Get out of here.
- Get lost.

1184
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:56,700
I am sorry Sir.

1185
02:01:56,700 --> 02:01:59,500
Sorry my foot, does this road
belong to your father...

1186
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:01,700
... your idiot. You blind fool.

1187
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:05,500
It was not my mistake.
Please forgive me.

1188
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:17,300
He is like your father, aren't
you ashamed to do this?

1189
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,900
This scoundrel is good for nothing.

1190
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:25,400
I will break this mans head.

1191
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:07,000
Hey Raju, why are you worried
for this beggar?

1192
02:03:11,933 --> 02:03:14,433
Take this money and
get yourself treated.

1193
02:03:43,006 --> 02:03:46,406
Father, had i not be sworn.

1194
02:03:46,498 --> 02:03:51,998
I would have cut his hands off.

1195
02:03:54,005 --> 02:03:59,005
Its okay my son; it was just
a few drops of blood.

1196
02:03:59,516 --> 02:04:02,716
The time has come to settle the
score for each drop of blood.

1197
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:06,500
I know you both will feel bad.

1198
02:04:06,617 --> 02:04:12,117
No aunty, he reaps just as he sows.

1199
02:04:12,516 --> 02:04:16,416
Yes, aunt. As you sow
so shall you reap!

1200
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,500
Tomorrow is the anauguration of
the factory. We must blow it up.

1201
02:04:30,003 --> 02:04:37,003
You two have conspired against my
brother; i will shoot both of you.

1202
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,000
Shalini?

1203
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,700
You too, will do the same thing
what your brother did years ago?

1204
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:56,000
Gajendra Singh destroyed your love
and now you want the same for them?

1205
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:03,500
Papa, because of you she has
led a life of a window.

1206
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:06,400
If we don't get our love...

1207
02:05:06,509 --> 02:05:10,009
... we will never marry and
lead a life of a window.

1208
02:05:11,932 --> 02:05:14,432
Will you able to see our tears?

1209
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:16,800
Will you happy by tormenting us?

1210
02:05:19,014 --> 02:05:24,314
Manjeet, i have never asked anything
from you. Today i beg of you...

1211
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:28,800
... to give me the happiness
of these children.

1212
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:33,100
How can i go against my brother?

1213
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,400
Vibhushan was also Ravanas brother.
When he realized he was with...

1214
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:48,500
... the wrong man he took sides with
Ram. It's up to you to decide.

1215
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:51,900
It this war between truth and
lie, whose side are you on?

1216
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,800
I am with you in this war.

1217
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:33,600
" A thousand lovers die at my smile."

1218
02:06:33,938 --> 02:06:40,538
" A thousand lovers die at your smile."

1219
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:47,700
" There isn't any one
like me in Hindustan."

1220
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:54,900
" There isn't any one
like you in Hindustan."

1221
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:26,800
" My bangles jingle and there's
music in my anklets."

1222
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:34,400
" My drape rustles like the wind and
there's music in my ankles."

1223
02:07:36,926 --> 02:07:40,926
" Sway your hips and strut yourself."

1224
02:07:41,018 --> 02:07:44,418
" Prop yourself and show your magic."

1225
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:58,600
" A thousand lovers die at my smile."

1226
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:05,600
" A thousand lovers die at your smile."

1227
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:12,700
" There isn't any one
like me in Hindustan."

1228
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:19,600
" There isn't any one like
you in Hindustan."

1229
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:06,300
" I am like fragrance
and like a flower."

1230
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:13,400
" I am like a fire, beware of me."

1231
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:19,900
" You are my thunderbolt, strike hard."

1232
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:23,700
" Let them see, as we have fun."

1233
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:37,800
" A thousand lovers die at my smile."

1234
02:09:38,016 --> 02:09:44,716
" A thousand lovers die at your smile."

1235
02:09:44,822 --> 02:09:51,822
" There isn't any one
like me in Hindustan."

1236
02:09:52,002 --> 02:09:59,002
" There isn't any one like
you in Hindustan."

1237
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:32,900
Who is my enemy?

1238
02:10:56,602 --> 02:10:57,602
You?

1239
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:58,800
Yes, it's me!

1240
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:03,100
Father in law it's him. You spit
on the plate in which you eat.

1241
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:04,600
Why what happened?

1242
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:08,400
Just because he slapped you,
instead of making you a partner...

1243
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:10,700
... you blew up his factory.

1244
02:11:10,837 --> 02:11:12,737
No, i did not.

1245
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,800
Small indifferences take
place in every household.

1246
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,100
No, i haven't done this.

1247
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:19,400
Then what were you doing in there?

1248
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:23,000
It was the drink i had and had to
use the toilet a couple of times.

1249
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:24,600
He's lying!

1250
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,900
Kishen search him.

1251
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,100
What happened?

1252
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:39,500
Remote.

1253
02:11:40,508 --> 02:11:42,408
How did this come in my pocket?

1254
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:44,000
What do you think he placed it?

1255
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,400
Yes. - No.

1256
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:47,000
You used this to blow it up.

1257
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,300
Eve the rest has been blown up now.

1258
02:11:53,928 --> 02:11:58,828
You scoundrel it wasn't even
insured. You have destroyed me.

1259
02:11:58,899 --> 02:12:03,399
Why are you bothering, he
will take care of him.

1260
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:05,000
No, no. He will beat me badly.

1261
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:20,500
Please ask him to stop,
he will kill him.

1262
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:43,500
Had you not been my relative, i would
have shot you. Get lost from here.

1263
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:47,700
And don't show me your
inauspicious face again. Get lost.

1264
02:12:57,096 --> 02:12:59,396
Your brother has destroyed me.

1265
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:05,700
Creditors will line
up and skin my flesh.

1266
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:14,900
Now only way is there to
compensate for this loss.

1267
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:22,900
The only way out, is to get the
minister's sons marry my daughters.

1268
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:31,000
After that the minister's money
will be in my control.

1269
02:13:31,500 --> 02:13:34,700
Gajendra, don't be under
this illusion.

1270
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,700
This relationship will
never happen now.

1271
02:13:36,823 --> 02:13:37,923
Who are you?

1272
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,800
I am minister Khuranas wife.

1273
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:44,800
Welcome, please come it.

1274
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:51,400
Stop right there. Now there is
a big difference between us.

1275
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,700
What kind of difference?

1276
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:55,500
The difference between
rich and poor.

1277
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:56,900
Hello mummy.

1278
02:13:57,804 --> 02:14:03,404
Come on boys let's go from here.
I have nothing more to listen.

1279
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:06,400
Please listen to him.
He is pleading.

1280
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:08,700
Daddy is requesting you, aunt.
Please listen to him.

1281
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:11,100
Aunt, you will do us a big favor.

1282
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:18,000
Okay come here.

1283
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:21,000
Wait! Sit on the floor.

1284
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:24,400
Sit on the floor in my own house.

1285
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,500
It is better to sit on the floor
than to beg on the street...

1286
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:31,800
... for the rest of the life.

1287
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:32,900
Sit down. Sit down.

1288
02:14:51,600 --> 02:14:55,900
How can i allow my husband to
sit on the floor in my house?

1289
02:14:55,931 --> 02:15:01,831
Tell her to stop there
or else i am leaving.

1290
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:07,800
You stop right there! Or
i'll break your legs.

1291
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:10,900
Now tell me.

1292
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:12,400
What do you want to say?

1293
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:17,400
Everyone in the village has
seen your boys with my girls.

1294
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:21,400
If this marriage doesn't take
place, we will be disgraced.

1295
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:26,000
Mom we must help him.

1296
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:30,900
He is surrounded by misfortune.

1297
02:15:31,900 --> 02:15:35,400
Seems he is a big sinner.

1298
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:42,100
He must have committed
some big sin.

1299
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:49,800
He needs some soul cleansing before
this marriage takes place.

1300
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Go and fetch some cow's urine.
- I will bring it now.

1301
02:15:57,100 --> 02:16:01,000
No i won't drink cow's urine.

1302
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:02,600
Then this marriage won't take place.

1303
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,000
Here take this.

1304
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:16,000
Drink it up like hot milk. Both are
manufactured in the same place.

1305
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,600
Really. - Yes, from the same company.
- You can eat mouth freshener later.

1306
02:16:19,719 --> 02:16:20,719
Drink it up.

1307
02:16:34,610 --> 02:16:37,610
Now you are capable
to be my relative.

1308
02:16:38,500 --> 02:16:39,600
But there is...

1309
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:40,700
What's next?

1310
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:43,700
Son, explain the diet to him.

1311
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:47,100
He's a non vegetarian
and eats meat and fish.

1312
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:49,100
He will eat that.
- He will eat that.

1313
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:51,700
What item is this?

1314
02:16:56,900 --> 02:17:01,500
No i won't eat that! I
can't have dog's meat.

1315
02:17:01,704 --> 02:17:04,404
Then this marriage
is over. Let's go.

1316
02:17:05,506 --> 02:17:09,106
Eat it. Think of it as a hot dog.

1317
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:12,700
If you don't eat this, proverty
will eat you up.

1318
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,300
Creditors will eat
you up like a dog.

1319
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:19,800
Before they eat you,
eat this hot dog.

1320
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,300
Okay i'll eat it, be quiet.

1321
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:18,300
All this was okay, but
what about the dowry?

1322
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:19,800
He's a pauper now.

1323
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,300
He's not a pauper, he still
has the factory land...

1324
02:18:23,443 --> 02:18:26,043
... and now he's our relative.

1325
02:18:28,808 --> 02:18:31,308
But how can i?

1326
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:37,100
Don't worry we have the legal
papers with us. Give him the pen.

1327
02:18:40,509 --> 02:18:42,009
No, i won't sign this paper.

1328
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:43,500
Why, can't you read or write?

1329
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:45,600
It's okay, your finger print will do.

1330
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:50,100
I won't sign.

1331
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:54,400
What is yours is ours and
what is ours is yours.

1332
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:58,000
Then why are you getting worried
about what is yours and what is ours?

1333
02:18:58,147 --> 02:19:00,847
We will return this
land after marriage.

1334
02:19:00,908 --> 02:19:02,308
Are you speaking the truth?

1335
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:04,100
Yes, or else we will
see your dead face.

1336
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:06,600
Sign it please.

1337
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,800
No, i won't let you sign this.

1338
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:17,800
Shut up! First your brother destroyed
me and now you have come. Get out!

1339
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:33,400
Mr. Khurana is returning
day after tomorrow...

1340
02:19:33,508 --> 02:19:40,608
... and will never allow this marriage.
It must take place tomorrow.

1341
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:56,820
Everything all right?

1342
02:19:58,900 --> 02:20:00,000
It's okay.

1343
02:20:01,700 --> 02:20:03,400
Call for the brides.

1344
02:20:15,229 --> 02:20:16,629
Aren't they looking lovely?

1345
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:21,400
Yes they are. I am in awe, in spite
of being a pauper...

1346
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:24,900
... how did you manage?

1347
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,800
I have used my brains.

1348
02:20:29,023 --> 02:20:32,823
What have you eaten,
you smell like a dog.

1349
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:34,400
How did he know about this?

1350
02:20:39,009 --> 02:20:41,109
Stand up for the nuptial rounds.

1351
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:50,500
Brother distribute these flowers...

1352
02:20:50,600 --> 02:20:52,600
... for the guests to sprinkle
on the newly weds.

1353
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:54,700
During the nuptial rounds.
- Alright. Alright.

1354
02:20:55,900 --> 02:21:00,500
Take this.

1355
02:21:04,500 --> 02:21:06,400
Mr. Khurana!

1356
02:21:15,867 --> 02:21:22,667
Why do you look surprised? I will
obviously come for my son's marriage.

1357
02:21:22,703 --> 02:21:25,103
Aren't you happy to see me here?

1358
02:21:25,207 --> 02:21:30,407
Of course i am. See your
wife is also here.

1359
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:32,400
And i have come on the right time...

1360
02:21:32,548 --> 02:21:34,948
... or else this auspicious
time would have passed.

1361
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:39,400
My handsome boys, you are looking
great in this attire.

1362
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:44,000
My darling sons. My sweet children.
The flowers of my garden.

1363
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:47,000
You look great in wedding dress.

1364
02:21:47,900 --> 02:21:49,900
You both are looking so sweet.

1365
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,700
God save you from evil eyes.

1366
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:53,100
What a great couple!

1367
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:57,900
Have also brought
along you friends.

1368
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:17,200
My dear wife, how did you imagine,
i would stop this marriage.

1369
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:22,600
I have always obeyed you.

1370
02:22:23,521 --> 02:22:25,821
I accept that i am the minister
or the state but...

1371
02:22:25,946 --> 02:22:27,646
... you are my home minister.

1372
02:22:27,706 --> 02:22:28,906
What is this?

1373
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,500
In my house everything is
done with your wish, wife.

1374
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:41,000
Why did you do this, tell me? If you
don't i will be highly disappointed.

1375
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:44,000
I will be ruined and
destroyed. Tell me.

1376
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:48,000
My dad always speak sweetly when
he is worried by the opposition.

1377
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:51,900
If he praises a party then that
party surely gets ruined.

1378
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:53,900
You won't tell me.

1379
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:57,500
He needs to be shut up or else 
this marriage won't take place.

1380
02:22:57,910 --> 02:23:00,610
I have understood you.

1381
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:02,400
Mother of the grooms.

1382
02:23:05,924 --> 02:23:06,924
My wife.

1383
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:09,560
Tell me dear, why are you silent?

1384
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:12,000
What's that?

1385
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:16,400
Shut him up too.

1386
02:23:20,701 --> 02:23:22,001
Continue the marriage ceremont.

1387
02:23:26,713 --> 02:23:28,813
Listen, brother in law.

1388
02:23:31,811 --> 02:23:35,711
The bride comes to the left
and the groom on the right.

1389
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Wait! I will tell you everything.

1390
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:44,400
I have regained my voice.
I know the truth. Listen to me.

1391
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:47,700
Whatever you wish to say, speak
over the microphone. - Thank you.

1392
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:03,700
Exchange the garlands. Now
the marriage is solemnized.

1393
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:35,800
The wedding has been performed...

1394
02:25:00,814 --> 02:25:02,514
Father in law, open their tapes.

1395
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:03,900
Do it.

1396
02:25:10,413 --> 02:25:12,613
Have some sweets.

1397
02:25:12,847 --> 02:25:18,447
To hell with your sweets and
these two are not my sons.

1398
02:25:20,200 --> 02:25:21,600
They are your sons.

1399
02:25:21,606 --> 02:25:22,906
No, no, no.

1400
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:25,400
She isn't your wife?

1401
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:27,500
She is an unwed wife.

1402
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,700
And she is acting like their mother
without giving them birth.

1403
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:34,700
They have taken revenge with you.

1404
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:40,400
Do you know who they are?
She is Surjeets sister Shalini.

1405
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:45,800
These two are his sons;
Raju and Kishen.

1406
02:25:49,900 --> 02:25:52,100
These two are my sons.

1407
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:54,900
Yes. - You have ruined everything.

1408
02:25:55,116 --> 02:25:57,616
But you put tape on your lips.

1409
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:00,900
And you have ruined your destiny.

1410
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:06,600
I didn't blow up your
factory, they did.

1411
02:26:06,700 --> 02:26:08,100
Both of them did it.

1412
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:10,900
Look, know they are
congratulating each other?

1413
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:14,100
I have fulfilled my brother's
last wishes.

1414
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:19,000
Today your pride is destroyed.

1415
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:24,300
The injustice you did with my
aunt today has been resolved.

1416
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:26,900
My dead father's soul
will now rest in peace.

1417
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:31,600
I had told you, true love
will always be victorious.

1418
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:34,900
Never come between it.

1419
02:26:35,608 --> 02:26:38,608
Because in the end it
become victorious.

1420
02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:48,400
You have given us much agony.

1421
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:55,500
Yet i am willing to
forget the past.

1422
02:26:57,607 --> 02:27:03,007
Children please seek his blessings.

1423
02:27:11,927 --> 02:27:13,427
Watch out Raju, Kishen.

1424
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:35,340
Brother once again they put forward
their hands of friendship...

1425
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:38,700
... and you wanted to stab them.

1426
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:42,400
Today destiny had something
else in store for you.
