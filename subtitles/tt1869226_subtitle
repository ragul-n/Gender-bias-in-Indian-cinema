1
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:56,847
Don't confuse me,
totally Rs.8.5 lakhs @2.5% interest,

2
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,918
after 3 months he says
it's Rs.9,15350,

3
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,748
what about the first Rs.2 lakhs,
what's the balance,

4
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:09,294
it's Rs.7,15357 after 3 months...
that too @ 3% interest,

5
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:12,022
Rs.3.5 lakhs @ 3.5% interest.

6
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:38,322
Drinking in groom's dress, sir?
Go and marry!

7
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,823
lsn't he telling you? Go!

8
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,961
Anyway you can't avoid coming
here after marriage,

9
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,153
so first go and marry!
- Go sir!

10
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,127
First gave Rs.8.5 lakhs...

11
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,766
After 3 months gave Rs.2 lakhs,

12
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,094
again gave Rs.1.5 lakhs
3 months later,

13
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,395
l gave Rs.Rs.3.5 lakhs
in 2 months, right?

14
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:51,502
l returned Rs.2.5 lakhs
to you immediately.

15
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:52,865
That was @ 2% interest
and this is @ 3% interest.

16
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,497
Totally it is Rs.7, 97911!
- No...

17
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,937
Rocking!

18
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:34,608
Great boss!
Come here, you move! Sit here.

19
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:38,641
What a brain and why are you here?

20
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:40,786
What's this dress?
- Why do you want to drink?

21
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:41,943
Tell me.

22
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:45,486
My ego will not agree to tell,
l need a drink.

23
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,785
Give him a bottle.

24
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:59,603
Balu, a genius...a brand name!

25
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,114
A genius...a brand name!
What next?

26
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:19,551
Why would l be on ground
after so many firsts?

27
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:23,890
Somewhere...in air...

28
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,101
Generally l don't believe in luck,

29
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,368
but my bad luck came in train
to make me believe it.

30
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:47,416
Did you see how my bad luck is?

31
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,417
So beautiful that l don't like,

32
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:53,416
so energetic to tire me out,

33
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:55,924
so cute to make me angry,

34
00:06:56,796 --> 00:07:01,426
my father himself went to the
station to receive my bad luck,

35
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:13,812
Uncle!

36
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,239
How are you dear?
- Fine.

37
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,816
Come.
- Uncle!

38
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:20,983
Me?

39
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:24,620
Then, l'll go back.
- Wait.

40
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,316
Just for fun, l'll carry it.

41
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,868
Uncle! Look there!

42
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,334
Balu's photo!

43
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:45,473
He's state first rank.
- Very nice!

44
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:46,874
Hi Balu!

45
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,058
Grandma!

46
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,322
Aunty!

47
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:11,326
Are you preparing chicken for me?

48
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:14,565
l'm grinding masala for it.

49
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:17,441
Please come in, madam.

50
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:22,239
This is your room but
please don't go upstairs.

51
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:24,280
Balu sir is very strict.

52
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:50,468
Who are you?
Why did you come upstairs?

53
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:52,841
Who are you all?

54
00:08:53,012 --> 00:08:55,173
l'm fourth!- Class?
- No, my name.

55
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:56,144
What?

56
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,876
That's the procedure here.
No names, just ranks.

57
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:01,179
Balu uncle calls us by ranks only.

58
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,356
He has no name, yet to pass exam.

59
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:12,020
How did you come here?
- lt's a long story!

60
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:13,662
We came here for granny's birthday,

61
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:14,959
without leaving after having cake,

62
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:16,625
we played cricket finding a bat here.

63
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:19,897
Hit the ball into Balu's room,
right here!

64
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:21,495
When we asked him
to return the ball,

65
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,073
he asked how much is 2x2=?.

66
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,404
Stop! 2x2=?

67
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:28,913
5?

68
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,580
One more candidate!

69
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:34,575
We too said 5,
we are here ever since then.

70
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,380
What about your parents?

71
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:40,583
Not to come out from Balu's room
till we grow up like Balu,

72
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,258
our parents left us here
and went away.

73
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,294
Yes sister, l don't have
sight problem,

74
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:51,267
but since Balu has, my parents
forced me to wear spectacles.

75
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:57,768
But your room is great!
- This room? No way, sister!

76
00:09:58,511 --> 00:09:59,910
We've to put on uniform
in home also.

77
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,740
l can't believe it.

78
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:03,808
Sister!

79
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:05,812
Don't touch anything.

80
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,919
No sister, he'll know if you
touch anything.

81
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,214
He's a CC camera.

82
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,954
Would he know if l close the cap?

83
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,493
Look on the table!

84
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:27,237
Sprinkling powder on mouse pad.

85
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:29,204
Keeping the pen open.

86
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,276
Keeping the book in
a different angle.

87
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,379
Changing places on chessboard

88
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,845
All are Balu's tricks.

89
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,285
You didn't do anything now, right?

90
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,885
Any difference in it,
we all get banged up.

91
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,388
By the way, who are you?

92
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:53,232
l'm Balu's aunt's daughter.

93
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,392
Balu has no relatives,
just ranks only.

94
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,567
Balu will not ask how are you,
he'll ask what's your rank?

95
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,437
Balu isn't like that,
l know him well.

96
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,778
Somebody had entered my room.

97
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:14,579
lt's me, Balu.

98
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,113
Your name?

99
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:18,820
You know, right?

100
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:20,960
l don't remember unnecessary things.

101
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:31,164
l can't waste so much memory for you.
Cut it short and tell me.

102
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:37,502
What's your rank?

103
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:40,846
l'm first in singing.

104
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:44,173
l mean in EAMCET.

105
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,315
What's your first year's percent?

106
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:51,048
lt is 55%.

107
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:54,157
You know my percent? lt's 95%.

108
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:56,522
That's why l've joined your college.

109
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,960
Percentage is mine not the college's.

110
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:03,100
l saw your hoarding near the
railway station, it was great!

111
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,396
See it in bus stop,
it's much better.

112
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:07,700
Look at the timetable.

113
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:21,253
What's this dish?

114
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:33,260
l can't waste so much memory for it.
Cut it short.

115
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,335
Chicken in this home, aunty?

116
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,476
l made it especially for Mahalakshmi.

117
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:48,979
No sister!
- Why?

118
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:53,243
This is chicken, sister.
- Yes, but it isn't Saturday, right?

119
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,320
Don't you eat on Saturday?
- No l don't.

120
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,821
Then, everyday is Saturday to you.

121
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,320
Why?

122
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:03,655
Balu hates chicken.

123
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,989
Then, l'll go back to my place.

124
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,663
Sister, get up!

125
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,717
Sit down.

126
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,181
Eat!

127
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:55,779
What?

128
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,623
Do you love non-vegetarian food?

129
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:12,787
Tell me your marks percentage again.

130
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:18,797
lt means second class.

131
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:20,962
Did you see brainless fellows?

132
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,806
One more example to show brain
doesn't work if you eat non-veg.

133
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:29,345
So, if you eat non-veg?
- Brain will not work.

134
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,179
Take away the chicken.

135
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,997
Wait for two minutes.

136
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,529
Mom, l'm going.

137
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,029
Take Mahalakshmi also with you.
- No way.

138
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:53,033
Mr.Balu Mahendra!
She's new to the college.

139
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,033
l brought her here to study
along with you.

140
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,865
Please take her too.

141
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:00,743
l'll drop her in college, mother.
Let him go.

142
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:03,404
You'll drop her today,
will you drop her every day?

143
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,050
Let him take her.

144
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:24,103
Bring a glass of water!

145
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:39,914
Drink!

146
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:45,023
Keep the glass inside and come.

147
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,855
Mahalakshmi, you wanted chicken,
you want curry or fry?

148
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:53,659
Some curry and some fry...

149
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:56,359
Cancel it, aunty.

150
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:00,365
Did l ask you to sit?

151
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:03,104
Sit.

152
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:12,981
Get down.

153
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:17,218
Share auto will come,
it'll take you to college directly.

154
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:18,548
What's this?

155
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,558
l'm relative in home
but Balu in college.

156
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:32,595
Yes.

157
00:16:51,124 --> 00:16:53,456
O God, you gave books in hands...

158
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:55,925
Too bad, you gave laziness
to bodies...

159
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:58,360
O God, you gave million
dollar syllabus...

160
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:00,796
Too bad, you gave us just
a milligram brain...

161
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,367
O god, you gave one-day match...

162
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:05,903
Too bad, you gave exam on same day...

163
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:08,507
O God, you gave a question paper...

164
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:11,075
Too bad, you gave blank answer sheet...

165
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:13,405
You gave too much beauty to watch...

166
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,048
But gave results that can't let
raise our heads...

167
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:18,275
Why are you playing double game with us?

168
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:21,410
Why are match fixing to fail us?

169
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:24,190
How?

170
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:36,234
Memory card is small...
memory status is vast...

171
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:41,237
Though brain is just a milligram...
create miracles with it...

172
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:46,435
Sing formulas in bathroom
instead of songs...

173
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:50,947
lf you fall in love, entire syllabus
will become a Swathi magazine...

174
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:53,245
Well said!

175
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:00,289
Numbers are totally hundreds
and thousands...

176
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,258
But the rank starts with him only...

177
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:13,463
lnstead of studying from A to Z,
just say B to U, that's enough...

178
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:30,721
We thought of inventing bulb,
but Edison spoiled it...

179
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:35,794
We thought of inventing telephone,
but Graham bell made the fist call...

180
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:40,729
We thought of making mark at Oscar,
but Rehman stole the chance from us...

181
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:46,168
We aimed at least to get first rank
but Balu was born for it...

182
00:18:56,116 --> 00:19:01,076
Edison who invented bulb,
did he find medicine to study well?

183
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:06,089
Had it stopped with telephone,
would there be cell phones now?

184
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:11,094
lf one thinks this is enough,
nobody would become a hero...

185
00:19:11,264 --> 00:19:16,224
lf you're happy with just past,
there's no future to your present...

186
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:27,612
ln whatever Balu sees no logic,
it's useless...

187
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:35,152
Whatever it is,
Balu is the centre of activity...

188
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:38,120
Whatever the question is,
Balu is the answer...

189
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:47,796
Whichever book Balu studies,
let's buy and study the same book...

190
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:52,871
Let's make photocopies
of the notes by Balu...

191
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:57,875
Pen used by Balu,
let's offer prayers to it...

192
00:19:58,044 --> 00:20:03,505
Let's all follow the path of Balu...

193
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:09,848
Results are out, buddy.

194
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,688
Who got the second rank?
- Ajit got it.

195
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:17,829
Why should l throw a party?

196
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:19,192
You came first, right?

197
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,664
Second ranker must give party here.
That's the rule.

198
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:23,597
lf he gives party every time
for getting first rank,

199
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,930
his dad's wealth will not last for long.

200
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:28,973
10 coffees, 10 cappuccinos...
- l don't have money.

201
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:30,904
Got his purse.

202
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:32,066
My purse!

203
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:37,411
My aunt's son!

204
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:40,412
Cancel the order.

205
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:51,827
l've made it a tradition to name the
new block on first ranker's name.

206
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:57,628
l knew you'd get first rank,
so the new block in on your name.

207
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:07,443
You changed the rule of
first ranker not giving the party,

208
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:09,741
but l wish you give a party to me.

209
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,715
For fun, why don't you come
second rank please?

210
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:15,218
You can never get a party from me, sir.

211
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,896
Why are you so dull after
getting first rank?

212
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:28,229
Had it been me?
- What would you do?

213
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:31,064
l'll say, that is Mahalakshmi!

214
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:34,236
You'll never get that chance.

215
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:37,400
ls she your aunt's daughter?

216
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:57,659
Do you smoke cigarettes?

217
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:01,927
People shouldn't think Balu gets first
rank because has no bad habits.

218
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,297
That's why l smoke.

219
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:10,302
Does it smell?

220
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:19,310
ls it from Roja?
- How do you know?

221
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:21,853
The lone girl left, read it.

222
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:28,192
To future Bill Gates,

223
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:30,129
your eyes are beautiful.

224
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:31,356
Underline it.

225
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,359
Your specs are good.
- Underline it.

226
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,201
But it doesn't suit you.

227
00:22:39,907 --> 00:22:40,737
Strike it off.

228
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,375
Strike off the before one too.

229
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,078
You mean your eyes are beautiful?

230
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:51,411
You drive the bike stylishly.
l'm underlining it.

231
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,019
Underline it again.

232
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:59,085
But it's not good to leave me
alone in the bus stop.

233
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:02,089
Don't use your brain,
just read the letter.

234
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,495
You said my Balu isn't like that.
What happened?

235
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:11,638
He left you in bus stop.

236
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:15,333
He told me not to call him
by relationship. lt hurt me.

237
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:18,137
2-year-old vengeance, sister.

238
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:21,509
He told me to get out
for blowing bike horn.

239
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:26,716
My name is Subrahmanyam,
how dare he calls me as ninth rank.

240
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:30,320
l don't brush teeth everyday
but l've to wash his bike daily.

241
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:31,651
Pour water!

242
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:40,332
l was like this, sister.
l'm now like this.

243
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:43,168
He's using my clothes now, sister.

244
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:49,500
He pinched no my thigh for touching
his computer. See this!

245
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:55,206
What's that mark?
- l made it myself lest l may forget it.

246
00:23:56,617 --> 00:23:58,881
Why are you silent, sister?

247
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:03,017
l've lab tomorrow,
l need a computer immediately.

248
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,887
Have you forgotten it, sister?
That's a first rank holder's computer.

249
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,359
What the hell first!

250
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,724
Should first rankers only
use the computer?

251
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:14,560
Sister is studying computer science,
why shouldn't she use it?

252
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,930
We want...wan want...

253
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:18,402
Stop!

254
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:22,235
l'll ask the computer for you,
let's go sister.

255
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:29,450
Don't get afraid, sister.
- He may beat us.

256
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:33,276
Move! l'll wake him up, sister.

257
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:39,287
No, it's 5!

258
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:41,620
What?

259
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:44,625
l've a doubt.

260
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:53,031
Actually X = 2, then Y = 3,

261
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:57,473
if l substitute X = 2
in this equation...

262
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:01,009
You carry on.

263
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,733
That's circle, right?

264
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:25,728
What's AE?

265
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:29,270
lsn't it diameter?

266
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:30,908
Telugu medium?

267
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:33,574
Didn't study?

268
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,415
You'll not study.

269
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:37,580
Why should you girls study?

270
00:25:37,918 --> 00:25:40,978
Some guy would work hard
to study and find ajob,

271
00:25:41,155 --> 00:25:44,591
and you marry him,
you enjoy his hard work.

272
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:51,791
Stop!

273
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,962
What was that on road? On my bike?

274
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:57,600
Nothing on bike...

275
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:00,603
Don't act innocence.

276
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:05,309
We hit a speed breaker,
bike jumped on it,

277
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,311
you fell on me,

278
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:10,307
your chest touched me,

279
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,979
you also knew it touched me,
but you stayed like that only,

280
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:20,820
there was difference
in your breathing too,

281
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:25,655
it means you felt something,

282
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:45,383
since l'm mature, it's okay,

283
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:46,675
had it been someone else,

284
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:48,879
they would've taken advantage
of the situation.

285
00:26:50,257 --> 00:26:52,885
You're kids, mustn't see this.
Go away.

286
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:54,391
Go!

287
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,057
Did you eat chicken?

288
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:02,724
Show me your hand.

289
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:06,096
Oh no!

290
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:11,737
l got one thing from it.
Never send sister alone to Balu's room.

291
00:27:14,114 --> 00:27:14,876
Go!

292
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:44,501
What happened?

293
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:46,947
Grandma, l'll fail the exam.

294
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:50,413
l didn't write well,
send me back to my native place.

295
00:27:50,584 --> 00:27:55,021
l can't understand anything here, aunty,

296
00:27:55,189 --> 00:27:58,317
they teach everything in English,
l can never pass.

297
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:03,524
What's it?
- Uncle, l'll fail.

298
00:28:03,697 --> 00:28:06,894
What's it dear?
- l can't understand anything, uncle.

299
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,535
end me back to my place.
- Will you go back to your place?

300
00:28:09,703 --> 00:28:11,568
Did we bring you here
all the way from there for this?

301
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:15,675
Do you know how much l had to
fight your father to bring you here?

302
00:28:15,843 --> 00:28:17,071
Please don't cry.

303
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:19,906
l'll fail in the exam, uncle.

304
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,742
Look what l've brought for you!

305
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:28,881
Still l'll go away to my home, uncle.
l can't understand anything here.

306
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,081
Have some milk, dear.

307
00:28:31,592 --> 00:28:34,755
Don't cry, aren't you my good girl?

308
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:51,976
l don't know how to pacify you.

309
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:57,810
Because l don't know the
pain of failing in exam.

310
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:00,820
l've never failed in life.

311
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:05,652
You said you're going back,

312
00:29:06,126 --> 00:29:07,821
is coming and going
your will and wish?

313
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,322
Anyone would fail if they don't study,

314
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,195
why are you sad for that?

315
00:29:17,504 --> 00:29:20,837
Study well and write again,
l'll also help you,

316
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:25,201
if you fail again,
l'll drop in your home myself.

317
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:30,011
This is my original timetable,

318
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:33,210
since l'm intelligent
one hour study is enough,

319
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:36,550
if l study for a hour,
you've to study for 5 hours.

320
00:29:40,728 --> 00:29:41,717
Got it?

321
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:44,724
These are my books.

322
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:45,727
Study!

323
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:47,389
Ask me if you've any doubts.

324
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:07,611
Lord Ganesha!

325
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:16,794
Bless me along with
Goddess of learning...

326
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:26,167
Share your wisdom of light to
brighten our intelligence...

327
00:30:57,237 --> 00:31:06,077
Bless me great lQ to understand
any lesson easily on listening...

328
00:31:06,246 --> 00:31:15,416
Bless me with great memory
to remember anything l read once...

329
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:20,049
Bless that question in exam

330
00:31:20,227 --> 00:31:24,561
Bless what l didn't read may
be left in choice...

331
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:28,428
Bless one mark for
every time l pray...

332
00:31:28,602 --> 00:31:33,630
Bless me tension free concentration...

333
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:38,301
Bless me a pen that doesn't
stop while writing answers...

334
00:31:57,531 --> 00:31:59,829
Did she pass or fail?

335
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,264
l'm sure she would've failed.
- No, she would've passed.

336
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:05,667
Neither she failed as he thinks
nor pass as you think.

337
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:06,828
Then? What happened?

338
00:32:07,574 --> 00:32:09,007
l had a dream.

339
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:23,687
Do you know this joke?

340
00:32:23,857 --> 00:32:25,552
l had a dream last night.

341
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:27,053
lt seems you got the first rank,

342
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:30,390
entire college was congratulating,

343
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:32,896
l was in splits laughing!

344
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,398
Buddy, results are out!

345
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:37,901
Who got the second rank?
- You!

346
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:52,941
Party? Why should l?

347
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,419
You came second, it's rule that
second ranker must give party.

348
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,787
lsn't it?
- Right!

349
00:33:05,866 --> 00:33:09,495
l was worried because no block ever
had a girl's name other than boys,

350
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:14,972
you've come like a Goddess
to fulfill my wish.

351
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:28,354
You've fulfilled my life ambition
of getting a party from Balu.

352
00:33:29,489 --> 00:33:32,856
l asked you for fun to come second,
but you really did it.

353
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:36,518
ls it necessary to make such
a big sacrifice for my sake?

354
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:39,528
Here sir!

355
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:49,007
ls it from Roja?
How many times do l've to tell her?

356
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:51,406
lts not for you but for me.

357
00:33:53,747 --> 00:33:54,736
Who gave it?

358
00:33:57,384 --> 00:33:59,545
lf he beats l'll take care.

359
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:01,917
How dare you write love letter
to my aunt's daughter!

360
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:03,890
Get on!

361
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,391
Will you take if anyone gives a letter?

362
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:13,089
Shouldn't you've slapped him?

363
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:16,899
l've become a guard to her.
l'm unable to guard her.

364
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,937
lf anything happens,
she'll be fine but we'll be abused.

365
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:22,501
lt seems Mahalakshmi
came first this time!

366
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:24,507
Some guy gave her letter and
you're asking about first rank.

367
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:28,079
First? My foot first! Anyone who
studies will get first rank.

368
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:30,239
Character is important here.
Can't you understand?

369
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:32,146
lt seems Mahalakshmi stood first!

370
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:35,482
She has, l helped her to study, right?
How can she not get?

371
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,955
l didn't write exams well
to raise her confidence.

372
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:41,651
Did entire college follow you?

373
00:34:41,828 --> 00:34:44,422
How can he give letter
unless she's lenient?

374
00:34:44,564 --> 00:34:48,295
lt seems he gave and she took it.
l've lost my respect in college.

375
00:34:48,468 --> 00:34:52,404
Grandma, tell me, isn't it shame
if anyone gives love letter to her?

376
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:54,005
Why isn't anyone bothering about me?

377
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:56,108
Leave it, l've to take care
of it anyway.

378
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,540
Why are you getting so irritated?

379
00:34:58,779 --> 00:35:02,215
ls it because he gave letter
or l got the first rank?

380
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:10,714
l think your stomach is burning,
have cool drink.

381
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:08,504
Who said eating chicken
will affect the brain?

382
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:19,818
Mother!

383
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:23,292
Yes son!
- Who gave password to my computer, dad?

384
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,195
Why?

385
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:28,196
You said the computer belongs
to the first rank holder.

386
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:31,860
You came second, so computer
belongs to Mahalakshmi.

387
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:34,233
Yes uncle!

388
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,966
Please tell him the password,
he's tensed.

389
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,444
lf l tell, he'll know, l'll open it myself
after finishing this leg piece.

390
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:45,676
No need, what could be her password
other than chicken 65!

391
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:47,411
l'll open it myself.

392
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:49,919
Not you...it's for 65!

393
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:51,556
Poor darling, don't feel sad.

394
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:55,252
Silly girl! Chicken is her world,
l'm sure that'll be the password.

395
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:09,641
Get out children!
What are you doing here?

396
00:37:45,412 --> 00:37:46,401
What a great figure you have!

397
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:47,578
How could Balu study with
such a great beauty at home!

398
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:49,840
Tell him to see you properly
after wiping clean his glasses.

399
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:51,415
What a waist!

400
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:54,884
l can spend an entire semester
just watching that one part!

401
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:57,922
l think circle was found
after seeing your waist.

402
00:37:58,091 --> 00:38:01,424
l think moon was drawn on sky
after seeing your waist.

403
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:04,564
l think zero was found
to measure your waist.

404
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:09,802
You've made me understand
many secrets,

405
00:38:09,936 --> 00:38:11,904
yours lovingly...

406
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,410
Aunty!

407
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:29,307
l didn't do anything!

408
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,412
Aunty!

409
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:37,590
Aunty!

410
00:39:38,258 --> 00:39:39,418
She's telling them.

411
00:39:41,394 --> 00:39:43,089
What happened?

412
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,095
Oh God! l'm finished!

413
00:39:45,632 --> 00:39:46,155
That is...

414
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:47,927
What happened, dear?

415
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:49,295
l beg you, please don't tell.

416
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:50,800
Don't be afraid, what had happened?

417
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,267
Stomach pain...no headache,
l want pain balm.

418
00:39:54,441 --> 00:39:56,807
Pain balm?
- Pain balm?

419
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,878
That's all? Mad girl!
l'll get it, wait.

420
00:40:01,247 --> 00:40:01,975
Take it.

421
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:25,996
l'm mature, so no problem.

422
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:28,564
lf not what would've
happened to you?

423
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:33,202
This isn't for me but for you.

424
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,640
She software draped in a sari...

425
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:11,943
She's first rank holder
sporting a pony tail...

426
00:41:12,118 --> 00:41:14,814
She's Goddess of learning
wearing high heels...

427
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:18,617
She's chilly bowl in the
eyes of our Balu...

428
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:46,615
She made a long jump
from the last to first...

429
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:49,654
She's flying kiss who
reached top from bottom...

430
00:41:49,823 --> 00:41:52,724
She's extension of sky
with her long plait...

431
00:41:52,892 --> 00:41:55,190
She's high tension in the
heart of our Balu...

432
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:13,644
Brother is telling story
and you're hailing the girl.

433
00:42:13,813 --> 00:42:16,976
Brother, don't feel bad,
drink this. Drink!

434
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,586
Brother, l've good idea
for you to come first.

435
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:23,086
He's telling flashback,
how can he take advice?

436
00:42:23,256 --> 00:42:25,417
That's why l want to tell.
- Let him continue, go ahead.

437
00:42:25,592 --> 00:42:27,719
Repeat the flashback again
from the beginning,

438
00:42:27,894 --> 00:42:28,986
this time you must
come first, brother.

439
00:42:29,162 --> 00:42:30,686
That's all!
- Like your damn face!

440
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,128
Don't feel bad, smoke cigarette.

441
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:34,427
Sometimes Tendulkar too
gets out on duck.

442
00:42:34,601 --> 00:42:36,330
What if gets out second time
also on duck?

443
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:38,436
l too had the same fear.

444
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:41,137
l couldn't take it.

445
00:42:41,608 --> 00:42:42,973
l must top at any cost.

446
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:44,437
l gave a good thought.

447
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:46,972
l went to KFC.

448
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:49,647
Ordered a bucket of chicken.

449
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:53,149
After eating a leg piece,
l got two ideas.

450
00:43:12,672 --> 00:43:16,369
Anytime is wartime
for Tom and Jerry...

451
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:23,213
Cat is cheating the mouse...
- Mom, l'm going to ground.

452
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:25,715
Fox is cheating the crow chick...

453
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:29,216
Moustache is cheating the plait...

454
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,592
Read the important books stealthily...

455
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:20,000
Mix the subjects and
make juice of syllabus...

456
00:44:20,173 --> 00:44:23,336
With the straw of eyes,
suck it up...

457
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:26,637
Ant is cheating sugar...

458
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,417
lf your sister has brain,
tell her to take out this ring.

459
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:34,712
Honeybee is cheating the flower...

460
00:44:34,888 --> 00:44:37,857
Squirrel is cheating the guavas...

461
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:58,442
What are you doing there, Kittaiah?

462
00:44:58,611 --> 00:45:00,408
l'm sprinkling rice to
keep ghosts off, madam.

463
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,411
Ghost?
- Yes madam.

464
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:07,282
A ghost with headlight roamed
the entire house, madam.

465
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:09,080
lt was reading English hymns, madam.

466
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:12,256
Now l know why alarm time changes,

467
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:13,392
why books go missing,

468
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:15,254
if l'm in bathroom,
door gets latched from outside,

469
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:17,419
thinking about all this
puts off my brain.

470
00:45:17,597 --> 00:45:20,464
l couldn't open this stupid ring.

471
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,262
Yes, l too had similar experiences.

472
00:45:23,436 --> 00:45:27,372
Why are your eyes bloodshot like devil?

473
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:30,738
How can anyone sleep
with ghosts stalking us?

474
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:34,505
l'm also scared of ghosts.
This is a big ghost house.

475
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,479
This is the chance,
have a go at the chicken.

476
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:41,643
Today is Saturday, aunty.

477
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:49,654
Okay, l'll keep it in fridge.

478
00:46:01,174 --> 00:46:02,835
Saturday is over and
Sunday is here!

479
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:05,567
lt means l can eat chicken.

480
00:46:18,624 --> 00:46:21,718
l can smell someone studying here!

481
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:38,603
ls it Balu the ghost?

482
00:46:55,028 --> 00:46:57,963
Ghost! l got scared thinking
it was Mahalakshmi.

483
00:47:03,636 --> 00:47:07,197
lt means he's studying at midnight
without your knowledge.

484
00:47:07,373 --> 00:47:08,670
lt's cheating.

485
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:13,278
Leg piece saved you, sister.
Don't forget it all your life.

486
00:47:13,713 --> 00:47:16,341
No loss if you build a temple
for that leg piece.

487
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:18,449
He's eating memory enhancing
herbal concoction.

488
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:22,315
So, that's his secret.
l thought it was own brain.

489
00:47:22,488 --> 00:47:23,819
Useless brain!

490
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,322
Suggest something boys!

491
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:30,360
You must also disturb him, sister.
Don't spare him!

492
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:33,058
How you must disturb him,

493
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,360
mustn't know one gets
disturbed for this too,

494
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:38,229
even kids like us mustn't get it,

495
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,406
you must disturb him like that.

496
00:47:41,908 --> 00:47:43,398
Got it?

497
00:47:59,692 --> 00:48:01,387
Grandma...

498
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:03,586
What's it boy?
- Look, how she's disturbing me!

499
00:48:03,763 --> 00:48:05,594
She's exposing!

500
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:09,292
She's a little girl!- Little girl!?
ls she a little girl?

501
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:13,932
Mouse is attacking the cat...

502
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:17,132
Flower is attacking the thorn...

503
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:20,368
Salt is attacking fire...

504
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,138
Mom, l'm going to the ground.

505
00:48:22,315 --> 00:48:23,646
Aunty, me too!

506
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:56,239
Got solution to criss-cross poses...
and for knotty theorems...

507
00:48:56,415 --> 00:49:00,818
Cheat the cheater...
fight for everything...

508
00:49:00,987 --> 00:49:03,046
Tough competition for the top rank...

509
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,549
Fish attacking the crane...

510
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:09,854
Deer attacking the tiger...

511
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,396
Half sari attacking the jeans...

512
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:35,776
Balu square into Mahalakshmi square
is equal to cheating square.

513
00:49:35,955 --> 00:49:37,422
That's super!

514
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,421
l'm tensed to know who came first!

515
00:49:39,592 --> 00:49:42,618
Tell me now, who came first,
you or Mahalakshmi?

516
00:49:44,297 --> 00:49:46,595
Why are you late?
- Today results will be out.

517
00:49:46,766 --> 00:49:47,960
l sought grandma's blessings.

518
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:51,228
l've a sentiment that
if l do like that l'll come first.

519
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:52,132
Get on.

520
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:58,341
Do the old woman's legs
really have so much power?

521
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:00,339
May be...why not take chances?

522
00:50:00,513 --> 00:50:02,344
Get down...get down.

523
00:50:03,015 --> 00:50:05,950
Hold it, l'll be back in a second.

524
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:25,566
Where are the legs?
l can't see them!

525
00:50:31,944 --> 00:50:35,004
Balu Mahendra has sought
my blessings!

526
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:38,812
Sit!

527
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:44,913
Father!

528
00:50:46,259 --> 00:50:47,886
How are you nephew?
- l'm fine uncle.

529
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,755
Get the fruit basket from auto.
- Yes sir.

530
00:50:51,931 --> 00:50:54,092
Aunt is making chicken
specially for me.

531
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,293
Why are you rushing for her marriage?

532
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,304
No, got a good proposal.
Very good boy.

533
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:02,838
They refused dowry too.

534
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:05,808
lt seems he saw Mahalakshmi
somewhere and he liked her instantly,

535
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:08,109
he wants to marry in a month
and take her to America.

536
00:51:08,347 --> 00:51:13,876
You're right, uncle,
fix her marriage immediately.

537
00:51:14,086 --> 00:51:15,110
Don't delay any further,

538
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:17,722
l'm almost dying in college
to protect her,

539
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:18,948
she gets dozens of
love letters everyday, uncle.

540
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,114
Entire college is after her.

541
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:22,488
lf you get her married
you know she'll go to America,

542
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,027
if not l'm scared
where she'll go away.

543
00:51:24,196 --> 00:51:27,461
You keep quiet, stop your nonsense.

544
00:51:29,635 --> 00:51:33,503
Son-in-law, she's mother less child,

545
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:38,770
that's why her uncle brought
her here to study,

546
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:41,378
why are you rushing for her marriage?

547
00:51:41,747 --> 00:51:43,715
After she finishes her studies,

548
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:48,386
we'll find a better man
and conduct her marriage.

549
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:52,054
There's difference between
marriage arranged by me and you.

550
00:51:52,858 --> 00:51:55,088
Anyway she's a girl,
no need to study anymore.

551
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:57,889
You're right again, uncle,
girls mustn't pursue higher studies,

552
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:01,431
if they do, their husbands can't
bear them and leave them.

553
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:04,730
Like how grandpa left grandma!

554
00:52:04,937 --> 00:52:06,029
Shut up!

555
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:08,435
Mind your words!

556
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:14,607
Your grandpa didn't leave me,
l left your grandpa and came here.

557
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,940
l've raised my children to this
position without any support.

558
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:26,958
Aruna, tell your son to keep
his tongue in control.

559
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:35,791
l'll take leave.
- Wait, you can meet him and go.

560
00:52:35,968 --> 00:52:41,304
No, he'll try to change my opinion.
l don't want to hurt him.

561
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,835
Father!

562
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:49,837
Groom wants to talk to you,
he'll come to your college on Monday.

563
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,518
Please wear sari on Monday.

564
00:52:58,023 --> 00:53:03,359
Are you studying?
Why are you working so hard?

565
00:53:03,662 --> 00:53:07,428
Someone would work hard,
find a good job and marry you,

566
00:53:07,533 --> 00:53:09,694
look, Mahalakshmi got herself
a man without any difficulty.

567
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:11,393
She's marrying next month, ask her.

568
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:12,935
Girls don't need to study at all,

569
00:53:13,105 --> 00:53:14,902
you must go to the gym
and tone up your figure,

570
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:18,202
why are we boys here for?
We'll do the hard work for you.

571
00:53:20,045 --> 00:53:21,137
l don't want to marry now, Balu.

572
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,044
Why are you sitting dull?
Results not yet announced?

573
00:53:24,216 --> 00:53:25,945
Announced!
- Then? Tell me!

574
00:53:26,118 --> 00:53:27,710
Mahalakshmi...
- Mahalakshmi...?

575
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:29,582
She got 95%!

576
00:53:30,723 --> 00:53:32,918
Then for me?
- You got 96%!

577
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,888
See, l'm first!

578
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:38,757
First time party for getting first rank.
Give whatever they ask!

579
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:44,768
Ajit has won!

580
00:53:44,937 --> 00:53:49,636
l was feeling sad for not
having any block with 'A',

581
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,800
but you've achieved it today.

582
00:53:52,044 --> 00:53:55,810
Yes buddy, Ajit got 97%! He's first!

583
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:06,987
Again Balu's party?

584
00:54:08,294 --> 00:54:09,955
Poor boy, leave him sir.

585
00:54:10,129 --> 00:54:15,328
His dad might've to sell property to
give parties whenever he comes second.

586
00:54:15,768 --> 00:54:17,998
l'll give the party this time,
come and enjoy sir.

587
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,803
First rank holder's name will
be permanent on the block.

588
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,876
lt can be Balu, Mahalakshmi or Ajit!

589
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:28,878
No away, it's fixed,
it'll be Ajit block

590
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:50,892
First rank must be between us only!
No one else must get it.

591
00:55:04,116 --> 00:55:05,606
Disturb Ajit's concentration.

592
00:55:06,352 --> 00:55:07,341
Spoil my marriage.

593
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,886
But l've a condition.
- l too have a condition.

594
00:55:10,055 --> 00:55:12,819
You mustn't say that is Mahalakshmi.
- You mustn't ask computer password.

595
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:14,960
l'm weak in embedded systems, Balu.

596
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:16,424
l know, l'll help you out.

597
00:55:16,595 --> 00:55:18,085
You're weak in virtual reality.

598
00:55:18,264 --> 00:55:20,562
l know you'll help me.

599
00:55:24,837 --> 00:55:26,998
Suddenly if we fight and
stop talking to each other.

600
00:55:27,172 --> 00:55:28,833
Who should speak first?

601
00:55:29,074 --> 00:55:31,474
Okay, heads you first
and tails l'm first.

602
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:36,171
No, heads you and tails me!
- lmpossible!

603
00:55:40,419 --> 00:55:43,013
Let's spin coin to select
heads and tail.

604
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:46,856
lf it's heads, tails is yours and
if it's tails, heads is mine.

605
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,193
Spoil the marriage

606
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:12,247
She was with in the pub till 2 am,

607
00:56:12,418 --> 00:56:14,477
l told Sandy told to drop
after she got drunk.

608
00:56:14,653 --> 00:56:16,416
l don't know where he dropped her.

609
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:28,423
Where are you going?

610
00:56:31,437 --> 00:56:32,426
What's this?

611
00:56:32,671 --> 00:56:33,638
Smack!

612
00:56:35,307 --> 00:56:36,205
Smack?

613
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:37,967
Didn't Mahalakshmi send you?

614
00:56:46,819 --> 00:56:48,309
Do you want Mahalakshmi?

615
00:56:53,459 --> 00:56:54,118
You are...?

616
00:56:54,293 --> 00:56:56,158
Ask...ask...ask who am l?

617
00:56:56,328 --> 00:57:00,697
Come...come...ask this dustbin!
Ask these plants!

618
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,461
Ask anyone in this college!
l'm Balu, Mahalakshmi's lover!

619
00:57:03,669 --> 00:57:07,036
Mahalakshmi is my life.
She's my love...she's my madness...

620
00:57:07,172 --> 00:57:09,333
Nobody can take away
Mahalakshmi from me.

621
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,048
l'll tell you about Mahalakshmi.

622
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:23,552
Don't believe anyone telling about her.

623
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:25,714
She's very good girl.

624
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:31,719
She's always first in class.

625
00:57:31,897 --> 00:57:34,388
l'm thinking of naming
this block on her name.

626
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,059
She doesn't have any bad habits.

627
00:57:40,939 --> 00:57:43,931
She failed in love with
a boy known as Balu,

628
00:57:46,111 --> 00:57:48,579
poor girl was very nice,
so she couldn't take it,

629
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:54,776
since then she's in pubs,
she has taken to drugs and drinks,

630
00:57:56,488 --> 00:57:59,457
l've never seen her smoking cigarettes.

631
00:58:06,732 --> 00:58:08,256
l too have a photo!

632
00:58:11,837 --> 00:58:13,134
Aren't you Prasad?

633
00:58:14,606 --> 00:58:18,838
l'm Mahalakshmi, my father told me,
that you'd come here.

634
00:58:19,044 --> 00:58:22,343
l saw your photo.
l'm seeing you now.

635
00:58:22,514 --> 00:58:24,004
l like you.

636
00:58:28,187 --> 00:58:29,484
No...no...

637
00:58:29,655 --> 00:58:33,182
Give me your number
to talk to you.

638
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:48,070
Spoil Ajit's life

639
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:19,332
My eyes are saying l love you...

640
00:59:19,538 --> 00:59:23,998
My lips are saying l love you...

641
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:35,212
What eyes hasn't seen
and lips never said...

642
00:59:35,387 --> 00:59:41,326
My heart is saying that
you love me...

643
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:56,369
l lost it while trying
to dry it in sun...

644
00:59:58,877 --> 01:00:03,371
Wind took my sari...

645
01:00:04,983 --> 01:00:18,886
lf you look at me mischievously,
l feel chill...

646
01:00:20,465 --> 01:00:22,660
l told you to just say l love you,
why did you kiss him?

647
01:00:22,868 --> 01:00:25,200
For l love he'll get disturbed
for a month only,

648
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:28,567
but for my kiss he'll get disturbed
for the entire semester.

649
01:00:47,793 --> 01:00:50,284
Two pairs of eyes are plus...

650
01:00:53,098 --> 01:00:55,396
All others are minus...

651
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:02,532
Equation of body multiplied by body...

652
01:01:02,741 --> 01:01:08,680
lt is equal to infatuation...

653
01:01:12,384 --> 01:01:17,048
Left angle and right angle joined
together to form a new triangle...

654
01:01:17,222 --> 01:01:21,955
For the youth's study, this is the
natural mathematical theorem...

655
01:01:22,127 --> 01:01:26,894
Straight line turned to create
a new picture...

656
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:31,696
Action moved and counter action
raised to generate heat...

657
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:53,755
What's this?

658
01:01:54,026 --> 01:01:56,927
Anyway you're matured, right?

659
01:01:57,429 --> 01:01:58,088
Go!

660
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:21,146
Metres for distance and
kilograms for weight...

661
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:26,087
This couple is measure to desires...

662
01:02:26,258 --> 01:02:30,854
Centigrade isn't enough and
Fahrenheit will not work...

663
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:35,625
lt's difficult to measure
the heat of youth...

664
01:02:35,801 --> 01:02:40,568
ln the early youth,
there's no end to desires...

665
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:45,369
No science can understand this...

666
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:49,878
Gravitation tells anything
thrown up will come down...

667
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:55,213
lnfatuation makes everything
topsy-turvy and upside down...

668
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,838
The boy is South pole and
the girl is North pole...

669
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,806
They've to unite to
become a couple...

670
01:03:51,977 --> 01:03:56,710
Boy is electron and girl is proton...

671
01:03:56,882 --> 01:04:01,683
lf they unite physically,
it'll produce electricity...

672
01:04:01,853 --> 01:04:04,515
Every sensation is a question...

673
01:04:13,865 --> 01:04:16,231
Another question is the answer...

674
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:19,826
lt's exam time for the youth...

675
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:23,139
Two bookworms...

676
01:04:23,308 --> 01:04:25,367
Have come to age...

677
01:04:25,544 --> 01:04:30,243
They got intoxicated eating
the sugary words...

678
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:35,913
What are those clothes?
Will you go out in the0m?

679
01:04:36,088 --> 01:04:39,580
Grandma, she's just a little girl.
No problem.

680
01:05:22,667 --> 01:05:27,536
What? What are you watching?
What's happening here?

681
01:05:28,573 --> 01:05:29,665
This is common.

682
01:05:30,075 --> 01:05:33,943
lt's there between any boy and girl.

683
01:05:59,738 --> 01:06:01,103
How do you all know this?

684
01:06:01,306 --> 01:06:02,739
Sir, we heard it many a times.

685
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:06,275
Okay, we've an exam tomorrow, right?
Let's study.

686
01:06:06,444 --> 01:06:08,776
Move...move...
- Study well!

687
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:12,882
This is what you call in English
as combined study.

688
01:06:13,051 --> 01:06:14,040
lt's a theory.

689
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:26,462
Son-in-law! l've a good proposal
for your daughter.

690
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:28,789
You can afford the proposal.

691
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:31,731
Come here personally, let's discuss.

692
01:06:53,191 --> 01:06:57,184
lf Tom and Jerry join together
who so ever it may be don't care...

693
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,234
lf you come first,
l'll tell you something.

694
01:07:15,146 --> 01:07:19,583
lf l come first,
l'll also tell you something.

695
01:07:19,186 --> 01:07:20,483
What did Mahalakshmi
planned to tell you?

696
01:07:20,654 --> 01:07:22,554
What did you want to tell her?

697
01:07:22,723 --> 01:07:24,247
Who came first anyway?

698
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,499
Did you promise to tell
anything if Balu comes first?

699
01:07:43,677 --> 01:07:44,644
Am l looking good?

700
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,972
What are you thinking
of telling him, sister?

701
01:07:47,114 --> 01:07:49,674
First tell me, how do l look?
l'll tell you after that.

702
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:52,944
Super sister!
- Then l'll tell you later.

703
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,144
Sister!

704
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,719
You never gave any party for
your son getting first rank,

705
01:07:58,892 --> 01:08:00,621
but why now?

706
01:08:01,028 --> 01:08:03,326
Wait for sometime,
my brother-in-law is coming,

707
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:05,965
l'll announce after he arrives.
A small suspense.

708
01:08:08,669 --> 01:08:11,661
Didn't you get the first rank?
- lsn't it enough if Balu gets?

709
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,534
lf he gets, is it yours too?

710
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:17,540
lt seems there's infatuation
between them.

711
01:08:25,485 --> 01:08:27,214
At last got a party from you.

712
01:08:29,623 --> 01:08:34,253
Anyway both of you made a good plan,
cheated Ajit to get the first rank.

713
01:08:34,428 --> 01:08:35,258
But still, he's great buddy.

714
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:38,489
Though they'd planned together,
he fell short by just 2% only.

715
01:08:38,632 --> 01:08:40,566
lf not he would've got the first rank.

716
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:45,903
Why hasn't your father come yet?
- He's on the way, very near.

717
01:08:46,073 --> 01:08:50,976
Sister, Balu wants you on
terrace urgently.

718
01:08:52,612 --> 01:08:56,104
Okay l'll take it, you go.
- Come, let's go for ice cream.

719
01:08:58,952 --> 01:09:02,752
Don't feel bad Ajit, winning and
losing is normal in life,

720
01:09:02,923 --> 01:09:05,949
brush it aside and
march ahead, that's all.

721
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:06,854
Who is it?

722
01:09:10,497 --> 01:09:22,136
Didn't l give him a great shock?

723
01:09:22,509 --> 01:09:23,840
He would've got shocked.

724
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:27,673
Should my dad sell property to
throw party if l get second rank?

725
01:09:28,715 --> 01:09:30,512
Whatever it is, he's great!

726
01:09:31,485 --> 01:09:34,352
Though we had disturbed him so much,
he got just 2% less than you.

727
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:38,514
Thank God, we had a plan if not
may be he would've topped.

728
01:09:39,826 --> 01:09:41,521
Our plan worked out very well, right?

729
01:09:42,829 --> 01:09:45,889
lf you hadn't disturbed him,
l wouldn't have topped, right?

730
01:09:46,066 --> 01:09:48,694
Definitely, he's very intelligent!

731
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,096
Whatever it is, Ajit is great,
isn't it Mahalakshmi?

732
01:09:51,271 --> 01:09:53,603
Absolutely!
- What about me then?

733
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:56,034
You mean...?

734
01:09:56,209 --> 01:10:00,976
l mean if Ajit is great,
what about me then?

735
01:10:01,148 --> 01:10:02,137
You're also great!

736
01:10:02,315 --> 01:10:04,579
There can't be two answers
for a question.

737
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:09,084
ls Ajit great or am l great?

738
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,093
You're great!
- Why that gap?

739
01:10:14,895 --> 01:10:17,159
Unless you think,
don't you feel l'm great?

740
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:22,094
Are you accepting by force?

741
01:10:22,269 --> 01:10:24,635
Come down to cut the cake.

742
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:27,638
Everyone is happy,
no need to fight now.

743
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:28,672
Come and cut the cake.

744
01:10:28,842 --> 01:10:31,470
So, you accept to avoid fight, right?

745
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:40,149
You promised to tell me
something if l top.

746
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:41,819
ls it this?

747
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:46,155
Stop!

748
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,988
Don't talk to me, l'm satisfied
of getting first rank.

749
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,154
l feel like it was given
as alms by somebody.

750
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:53,859
Your father is calling you
to cut the cake.

751
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:55,365
Party is cancelled,
ask everyone to leave.

752
01:10:55,569 --> 01:10:56,695
Tell my father.

753
01:10:57,871 --> 01:10:59,065
l've become an idiot to everyone.

754
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:01,707
ls Ajit great? How can he be great?

755
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:03,672
How could get you such a thought?

756
01:11:03,844 --> 01:11:06,039
ls one great if he gets disturbed
if someone disturbs?

757
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:08,875
lf he was really intelligent,

758
01:11:09,049 --> 01:11:10,812
he wouldn't get disturbed
even if anyone disturbs him.

759
01:11:10,984 --> 01:11:13,578
Didn't you disturb me with infatuation?
Did l get disturbed?

760
01:11:13,753 --> 01:11:16,551
Did l disturb you?

761
01:11:16,723 --> 01:11:19,351
lf you had disturbed Ajit,
it means you've disturbed me too.

762
01:11:19,526 --> 01:11:22,552
Are both same?
- Same!

763
01:11:24,231 --> 01:11:25,926
lf it's same, l'm telling you now,

764
01:11:26,099 --> 01:11:28,590
Ajit is greater than you!
- Yes!

765
01:11:29,736 --> 01:11:31,897
Get out from my house.

766
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:34,807
Eats here but praises him.

767
01:11:34,975 --> 01:11:36,499
What? What did you say now?

768
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,871
l said you eat here but
praise him, so what?

769
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,275
What's the problem, son?
- Look, what is she saying?

770
01:11:41,414 --> 01:11:43,279
We brought you here from village,

771
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:45,748
gave you boarding and lodging,
paid your college fees,

772
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
and she praises someone else!

773
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,247
Ajit is great! Who the hell is he?

774
01:11:49,422 --> 01:11:52,289
Who is spending on whom?
Uncle started business with my dad's money.

775
01:11:52,459 --> 01:11:52,982
Don't forget it.

776
01:11:53,159 --> 01:11:55,252
He's talking nonsense,
you too are joining him.

777
01:11:55,428 --> 01:11:57,089
Look at her dad,
what nonsense she's blabbering.

778
01:11:57,264 --> 01:11:59,289
lt seems this business
belongs to them.

779
01:11:59,466 --> 01:12:00,797
lt seems we are living in their home.

780
01:12:00,967 --> 01:12:01,956
lt seems we are eating
out of their hands.

781
01:12:02,135 --> 01:12:03,466
How dare you abuse my dad!

782
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:07,663
Had he not brought you here,
you'd be a maid in that place!

783
01:12:07,841 --> 01:12:11,470
l can live like a maid but
you can't live without first rank.

784
01:12:11,678 --> 01:12:13,168
Yes, l can't live without first rank,

785
01:12:13,313 --> 01:12:16,510
but remember one thing,
without us, your family can't survive.

786
01:12:16,883 --> 01:12:21,183
Okay, you fed me, you clothed me,
and paid the fees,

787
01:12:21,354 --> 01:12:25,313
isn't it? l'll repay every penny
with interest after getting ajob.

788
01:12:25,492 --> 01:12:27,016
Who will offer you ajob?

789
01:12:27,193 --> 01:12:29,889
When l start my company,
l'll keep ajob open for you,

790
01:12:30,063 --> 01:12:30,995
join whenever you want to!

791
01:12:31,164 --> 01:12:33,860
Okay, inform me when your
company is in troubles,

792
01:12:34,034 --> 01:12:35,365
l'll come to help you out.

793
01:12:36,202 --> 01:12:39,729
l'll make you say that is Mahalakshmi!
- Get lost!

794
01:12:44,511 --> 01:12:46,069
Father!
- Stop dear!

795
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:50,178
When did you come, son-in-law?

796
01:12:50,317 --> 01:12:52,182
Please come in.
- No father, let's not stay here.

797
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:53,911
Please take me away with you.

798
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:54,781
Brother-in-law, please come in.

799
01:12:54,955 --> 01:12:57,219
lt's childish fight,
you please come in.

800
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:59,756
No please, let's discuss later.

801
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,095
Hey you, stop!
Tell me the password and go.

802
01:13:22,882 --> 01:13:25,146
Please don't put interval card now!
Already dying with tension.

803
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:28,310
l'm also dying holding it for long.

804
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:29,648
Brother!

805
01:13:36,896 --> 01:13:38,329
Are you fine sir? Welcome please.

806
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,259
Stop children! Who are you?
Why are you going in?

807
01:13:42,435 --> 01:13:44,266
Mahalakshmi's marriage, Kittaiah.

808
01:13:44,437 --> 01:13:45,870
Calling me by my name, who are you?

809
01:13:46,072 --> 01:13:48,336
How dare you ask who we are?

810
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:50,874
Beating me? Who are you?
- Don't you know him?

811
01:13:51,044 --> 01:13:53,308
He's me, l'm Nikhil!
- ls it?

812
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:56,040
l've become like this in 3 years.
You go!

813
01:13:56,216 --> 01:13:59,310
This is l, Lalithya!
- l'm Subrahmanyam.

814
01:13:59,486 --> 01:14:01,386
l'm Shravani.
- l'm Roshan.

815
01:14:01,554 --> 01:14:04,887
ls it you children?
How big you've grown up?

816
01:14:05,258 --> 01:14:06,384
Sister!

817
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:12,730
We need to talk personally,
all of you get out.

818
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:13,764
How are you studying?

819
01:14:13,933 --> 01:14:16,925
Why are you asking like Balu, sister?

820
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,566
Close your eyes, sister.
- Why?

821
01:14:25,111 --> 01:14:26,942
Your favourite chicken!

822
01:14:27,147 --> 01:14:29,240
No please, stopped eating chicken.

823
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:32,681
Have you stopped eating chicken?
- Yes.

824
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:33,750
What happened, sister?

825
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,290
Did Balu say anything? l'm going
to gym, tell me, l'll knock him down.

826
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,788
Please tell us, sister!

827
01:14:46,433 --> 01:14:49,869
You know Balu and l had a fight then.
- Yes.

828
01:14:50,136 --> 01:14:52,866
After that we didn't talk to
each other for quite sometime.

829
01:14:53,339 --> 01:14:56,831
After 3 years l received a phone
about grandma falling seriously ill.

830
01:15:13,493 --> 01:15:15,484
How is she, doctor?

831
01:15:15,662 --> 01:15:16,822
How are you related to the patient?

832
01:15:16,996 --> 01:15:18,930
She's my grandmother.
- Ask him.

833
01:15:21,067 --> 01:15:23,228
Uncle...how's grandma?

834
01:15:23,403 --> 01:15:27,066
How are you?
When did you come here?

835
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,764
Tell me, how is grandma's
condition, uncle?

836
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:32,241
Forget about grandma,
tell me how are you doing?

837
01:15:32,412 --> 01:15:34,710
You promised to repay money
with interest, have you brought it?

838
01:15:34,881 --> 01:15:36,906
Leave it uncle,
tell me how is grandma?

839
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:38,675
What should l say?

840
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:43,252
l didn't want you to remain in village
and brought you here to study,

841
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:45,253
will you repay with interest that too?

842
01:15:46,392 --> 01:15:50,089
When your mother died,
it my wife who fed her milk to you,

843
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:54,257
you always had to fight
with Balu for it,

844
01:15:54,434 --> 01:15:56,265
will you repay that too with interest?

845
01:15:58,705 --> 01:15:59,433
Uncle...

846
01:16:03,843 --> 01:16:07,472
Calm down...please don't cry, dear.
Grandma is fine.

847
01:16:08,047 --> 01:16:11,813
With your tears,
you've paid the interest. Okay?

848
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:15,750
Uncle!

849
01:16:15,922 --> 01:16:19,289
You've cried again,
this time principle is also settled.

850
01:16:19,459 --> 01:16:20,653
Shall we meet grandma?

851
01:16:21,461 --> 01:16:22,655
Come...come...

852
01:16:24,464 --> 01:16:26,864
Do you've change for Rs.500?
- No please.

853
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,666
Got change for Rs.500?
- No please.

854
01:16:33,106 --> 01:16:35,040
Got change for Rs.500?
- No please.

855
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:38,871
Nephew!
- Uncle! When did you come?

856
01:16:39,045 --> 01:16:41,878
l didn't see you.
- Don't act smart! How much you need?

857
01:16:42,448 --> 01:16:43,881
Rs.10, uncle.

858
01:16:44,284 --> 01:16:45,376
Take it.

859
01:16:45,718 --> 01:16:46,707
Pay it first.

860
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,718
No problem we'll see while
settling your account.

861
01:16:49,889 --> 01:16:51,049
Sorry, uncle.

862
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:25,919
Do you want coffee, dad?

863
01:17:26,092 --> 01:17:30,290
We had it just now,
you and Mahalakshmi have it. Go!

864
01:17:51,885 --> 01:17:56,686
Heads, it means you must
talk to me first.

865
01:18:02,128 --> 01:18:04,358
But you've already talked to me.

866
01:18:04,697 --> 01:18:06,358
You never gave me the chance.

867
01:18:11,204 --> 01:18:13,900
How are you?
- Not fine.

868
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:16,541
Recession, lost my job.

869
01:18:17,744 --> 01:18:19,405
l bought a flat trusting the job,

870
01:18:19,579 --> 01:18:22,480
l'm unable to pay the installment,
l sold off the land,

871
01:18:22,649 --> 01:18:26,585
and dad now stays with me here,
situation is quite bad.

872
01:18:30,089 --> 01:18:31,579
Why are you staring at me?

873
01:18:32,558 --> 01:18:34,583
Won't you be happy
if l say like that, right?

874
01:18:40,767 --> 01:18:42,166
Won't you make me happy then?

875
01:18:42,268 --> 01:18:43,758
Should l make you happy?

876
01:18:45,438 --> 01:18:48,430
Started a company last year,
lost Rs.100 crores,

877
01:18:48,608 --> 01:18:50,098
don't have money even to shave,

878
01:18:50,276 --> 01:18:52,471
this is my last shirt
and my grandma is ill...- Enough!

879
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:55,773
Father is tensed yesterday, l bought
a car and it met with an accident today.

880
01:18:55,949 --> 01:18:57,974
l broke up with my girl friend.
- l'm very happy.

881
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,984
Wasn't our behaviour very childish then?

882
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:09,155
When l slept, you studied.
- l felt jealous if get first rank.

883
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:10,296
Hiding the books.

884
01:19:10,463 --> 01:19:12,124
Reading text books hiding
inside film magazines.

885
01:19:12,298 --> 01:19:14,289
l challenged to make you
say that's Mahalakshmi!

886
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:16,833
l made an open offer ofjob
to you in my company.

887
01:19:18,204 --> 01:19:20,672
l feel like laughing loud thinking
about all that.

888
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:26,039
Let's speak truth now.

889
01:19:26,212 --> 01:19:29,204
What are you doing?
- l'm with lnfosys.

890
01:19:32,318 --> 01:19:33,876
l've taken a flat in Madhapur.

891
01:19:34,887 --> 01:19:35,717
What about you?

892
01:19:36,589 --> 01:19:40,889
l...you told me the truth.

893
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,893
l can't live if l'm not number one.

894
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:50,230
Last year l started a company
known as Cloud Technologies,

895
01:19:52,405 --> 01:19:56,569
there are about 100 employees
working for me now,

896
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:00,275
turnover is Rs.40 crores,
planning to open a branch in US...

897
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,449
What did you say your salary was?

898
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,114
Lowest paid employee in
my company is Rs.2 lakhs.

899
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:14,389
lf you need ajob at anytime...

900
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,619
l'll offer you job immediately.

901
01:20:17,864 --> 01:20:21,664
lf l beg for ajob with you,
you'll offer me ajob, right?

902
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:26,328
l'm not what l used to be,
l've changed.

903
01:20:27,173 --> 01:20:28,800
How am l to prove it?

904
01:20:33,446 --> 01:20:34,674
l accept it.

905
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:40,444
Though l accepted Ajit is great,

906
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,180
you still don't have the heart
to say no, you're great!

907
01:20:45,558 --> 01:20:47,992
l thought you've matured
with your initial talk.

908
01:20:48,161 --> 01:20:52,689
l know you're not matured enough
to talk to me first, so l did it.

909
01:20:55,835 --> 01:20:57,234
You haven't changed, Balu.

910
01:20:58,271 --> 01:20:59,863
You too haven't changed, Mahalakshmi.

911
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:07,303
You've a black Benz, right?
Why did you come in white Benz?

912
01:21:07,513 --> 01:21:10,778
Black Benz only, painted it white
fearing black may fade.

913
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,247
lndian roads, right?

914
01:21:12,418 --> 01:21:15,683
You're absent minded, right?
Thought you've brought someone else's car.

915
01:21:15,822 --> 01:21:17,255
Absent minded?

916
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:22,723
Even Google may forget, l will not.
- Do you remember Hyderabad?

917
01:21:22,895 --> 01:21:25,261
What has changed here to forget?

918
01:21:25,598 --> 01:21:27,122
Brother-in-law...
- Greetings.

919
01:21:27,266 --> 01:21:30,429
Jayanthi's...
- Husband! l remember him.

920
01:21:34,574 --> 01:21:37,566
But l don't have numbers
to contact them.

921
01:21:37,743 --> 01:21:38,937
Please tell me your number.

922
01:21:39,579 --> 01:21:41,945
l can't feed lndian numbers,
do it yourself.

923
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:44,309
When did you buy this place?
- Just 6 months back.

924
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:46,645
Six months ago! Very old model!

925
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:47,649
Take it.

926
01:21:49,522 --> 01:21:53,322
Same name not changed yet.
- That's his memory!

927
01:21:55,228 --> 01:21:57,628
lf you've such great memory,
you must recognise me then?

928
01:21:57,797 --> 01:22:01,392
How can l forget you? He's our...our...

929
01:22:01,601 --> 01:22:03,831
My son!
- Yes your son. How can l forget him?

930
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:05,834
He was playing with beard as a child.

931
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:08,235
But l don't have numbers to contact them.

932
01:22:08,407 --> 01:22:10,637
Please feed your number in it.

933
01:22:10,776 --> 01:22:13,267
John uncle left to US
when you were 4 years old.

934
01:22:13,446 --> 01:22:15,539
lt took me 20 years to come to lndia.

935
01:22:15,982 --> 01:22:18,576
Why did you take so much time?
Did you walk back to lndia?

936
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:24,520
Are you cracking jokes on me?
You've to marry now, Surya.

937
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:25,850
Surya? Who is he?

938
01:22:26,025 --> 01:22:28,425
Who is Surya? Have you forgotten
your son's name too?

939
01:22:28,594 --> 01:22:29,390
Surya is you son.

940
01:22:29,562 --> 01:22:32,395
My name isn't Surya, uncle,
my name is Balu.

941
01:22:32,598 --> 01:22:36,227
l fed my name wrongly to test
your great memory.

942
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:41,731
What's aunt's number? l know it.
- His memory is in his cell phone.

943
01:22:42,308 --> 01:22:43,707
How are you aunt?

944
01:22:46,112 --> 01:22:48,945
Don't you remember me
unless l fall sick?

945
01:22:49,081 --> 01:22:49,945
Don't say like that, aunt.

946
01:22:50,082 --> 01:22:52,949
All others' numbers are in this,
but yours is in my brain.

947
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:55,417
Had you not helped me to study,
would l've gone to America?

948
01:22:55,588 --> 01:22:57,180
Would l've driven Benz cars?

949
01:22:57,356 --> 01:22:59,984
By the way, what's your problem, aunt?

950
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:02,992
You didn't get heart attack
even when you left uncle,

951
01:23:03,162 --> 01:23:05,289
but you've got it now, that means
you're hiding something in heart.

952
01:23:05,464 --> 01:23:08,126
tell me what's that is affecting you?
l'm here from US for you.

953
01:23:08,334 --> 01:23:09,961
Please give me a chance
to repay my gratitude.

954
01:23:12,205 --> 01:23:17,336
That's the matter, aunt will be happy
if Balu and Mahalakshmi marry.

955
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:19,978
Take it as her last wish.
What do you say?

956
01:23:20,146 --> 01:23:22,876
lf they agree, it's okay from our side.

957
01:23:23,049 --> 01:23:24,175
What do you say, brother-in-law?
- Yes.

958
01:23:24,951 --> 01:23:27,181
Children! What do you say?

959
01:23:33,226 --> 01:23:34,693
l've a girl friend!

960
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:39,529
l'm planning to marry her only.

961
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:40,529
Brother!

962
01:23:44,237 --> 01:23:46,398
Mother, this is Swapna.

963
01:23:46,572 --> 01:23:48,733
Greetings aunty.
- My dad.- Greetings uncle.

964
01:23:48,908 --> 01:23:50,273
You never told me.

965
01:23:51,577 --> 01:23:52,908
Your number please.

966
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,243
Then, no need.

967
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,052
Who is she?

968
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:05,554
l told you about a girl
l'll not introduce, that's her.

969
01:24:12,765 --> 01:24:14,756
What does your father do?
- He's an auditor, uncle.

970
01:24:14,934 --> 01:24:17,767
Balu's taste is sensational, right?

971
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,705
Balu's taste is great
but her taste is really bad.

972
01:24:21,841 --> 01:24:23,468
Very cheap!

973
01:24:23,843 --> 01:24:26,107
He's very moody, how did you get him?

974
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:28,109
Father...
- Don't say like that, uncle.

975
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:33,316
He would've fallen for this one word!

976
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:36,485
Watch! l'll get the truth out!

977
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:40,854
l need to ask few questions
about your personality,

978
01:24:41,027 --> 01:24:42,494
your...
- Height, uncle?

979
01:24:44,897 --> 01:24:47,661
You mean...
- She's 2 inches taller than me.

980
01:24:48,301 --> 01:24:49,097
Now...

981
01:24:51,604 --> 01:24:54,368
You mean...
- Rs.50000 more than mine.

982
01:24:54,707 --> 01:24:58,006
Look, personality means...

983
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:06,209
l got it, isn't it marks?
She failed in a subject.

984
01:25:06,385 --> 01:25:08,216
You've ashamed America.

985
01:25:08,621 --> 01:25:11,749
Phone number! But, 6 digits only?
Wrong number.

986
01:25:11,924 --> 01:25:15,724
lt's not phone number but
measurements of Miss lndia.

987
01:25:18,397 --> 01:25:19,728
How much bigger than you?

988
01:25:27,173 --> 01:25:30,540
Father, find a good groom for me.
He must be taller than Balu.

989
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:33,008
Stylish than him.
Must smile better than Balu.

990
01:25:33,179 --> 01:25:35,443
l mean he must be pretty
handsome than Balu.

991
01:25:36,449 --> 01:25:39,941
What's your idea anyway,
you say Balu is stylish,

992
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:42,946
his smile is good,
and that he's handsome.

993
01:25:56,802 --> 01:25:57,962
Do you also have a boy friend?

994
01:25:58,137 --> 01:26:00,970
lf Balu has a girl friend,
then l must've a boy friend, right?

995
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,437
Right!

996
01:26:02,608 --> 01:26:04,906
Why should we wait for
a fool's arrival, uncle?

997
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:08,376
He's Mahalakshmi's boy friend.
- l said about him only.

998
01:26:08,547 --> 01:26:10,811
ls his name Fool? l didn't know.

999
01:26:10,983 --> 01:26:12,348
Fool!

1000
01:26:12,685 --> 01:26:14,175
ls his name Fool?

1001
01:26:16,222 --> 01:26:20,522
l can't believe that someone
loves Mahalakshmi, uncle.

1002
01:26:32,838 --> 01:26:35,102
Are you comfortable, Ajit?

1003
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:38,736
What does he lack in a Benz car?

1004
01:26:38,911 --> 01:26:42,142
No uncle, he's 6.1 feet tall,
his head may hit the roof.

1005
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,441
6.1?
- Yes uncle.

1006
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:46,517
He's 2 inches taller than you, Balu.

1007
01:26:46,685 --> 01:26:48,585
Doesn't your head hit
the roof in your car?

1008
01:26:48,754 --> 01:26:53,748
He got 3 cars custom built
cars by Audi company.

1009
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:58,560
3 cars? 2 more cars than Balu
Where do you work, Ajit?

1010
01:26:58,731 --> 01:27:00,596
Work?

1011
01:27:03,436 --> 01:27:07,065
100 crores?
Twice more than Balu's business.

1012
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:12,643
You know l don't like all this.
- See uncle, he hates praise.

1013
01:27:14,013 --> 01:27:17,471
That's why, Ajit is always great to me.

1014
01:27:20,019 --> 01:27:22,817
Won't you watch the signal?
Are you blind?

1015
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:24,751
My car is safe.

1016
01:27:24,924 --> 01:27:27,290
l didn't hit you,
why are you getting so angry?

1017
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:28,290
How would you know?

1018
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:31,487
lf anything had happened,
my heart would cease.

1019
01:27:32,131 --> 01:27:33,655
My car is my life.

1020
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,323
Go...go away!

1021
01:27:39,071 --> 01:27:41,972
Okay the project immediately.

1022
01:27:42,074 --> 01:27:44,235
Our company must cross
100 crores with it.

1023
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:45,877
That's very risky!

1024
01:27:46,045 --> 01:27:47,842
Acquire new systems,
recruit new people,

1025
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:49,537
if anything goes wrong,
we'll be in big trouble.

1026
01:27:49,715 --> 01:27:52,275
lf we succeed?
- l said it's risky.

1027
01:27:52,451 --> 01:27:54,715
No life without risk.

1028
01:27:54,887 --> 01:27:57,253
Though l know you're a fool,
didn't l take you as my partner?

1029
01:27:57,423 --> 01:27:59,857
lsn't that a risk?
This one is also like that.

1030
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,721
Are both same?
Then okay.

1031
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:06,528
Gave a good twist, sister.

1032
01:28:06,699 --> 01:28:09,998
Ajit's entry was sensational.
- Balu would've got jolted.

1033
01:28:10,135 --> 01:28:12,228
You should've called us too,
we would've teased Balu.

1034
01:28:12,404 --> 01:28:15,601
We would've teased him.
- Yes sister.

1035
01:28:15,774 --> 01:28:18,299
How did the engagement go?

1036
01:28:23,282 --> 01:28:25,273
Balu - Swapna Engagement

1037
01:28:25,784 --> 01:28:26,773
Mahalakshmi - Ajit Engagement

1038
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:34,287
Long way...

1039
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:40,626
Long way without any shore...

1040
01:28:40,933 --> 01:28:47,361
Though taking the same exam...
though written the same answer...

1041
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:54,001
Each one of the two
remain as question...

1042
01:28:54,580 --> 01:29:01,179
Though met in the in same boat
and travelling together...

1043
01:29:01,353 --> 01:29:07,849
They reached different worlds...

1044
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:20,898
Shared same past and same truth...
They hanged it by noose...

1045
01:29:22,074 --> 01:29:34,919
Broke the world to create
their own worlds in it...

1046
01:30:13,092 --> 01:30:17,153
So near yet so far...

1047
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:20,696
Distance without any
way till now...

1048
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:26,703
Today breaks in to
separate the couples...

1049
01:30:26,872 --> 01:30:30,899
Distance has been orphaned
without a friend...

1050
01:30:31,076 --> 01:30:34,375
Distance has been left
burning in the fire of loneliness...

1051
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:40,349
lt's enjoying the breaking up
of relationships...

1052
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:47,186
Distance is bitter in
growing separation...

1053
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:54,390
Distance is glowing as dark night
of pangs of separation takes over...

1054
01:31:15,454 --> 01:31:16,785
Where's your son-in-law?

1055
01:31:16,955 --> 01:31:17,614
Nephew!

1056
01:31:19,191 --> 01:31:21,751
Not your nephew,
your future son-in-law.

1057
01:31:22,261 --> 01:31:23,285
Son-in-law!

1058
01:31:38,043 --> 01:31:41,240
A distance where can't take a step...

1059
01:31:41,447 --> 01:31:44,678
A distance where you
can't cover an inch too...

1060
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:51,449
Distance ofjust seven steps
has been stretched too far...

1061
01:31:51,623 --> 01:31:54,990
Distance that changes word
every milestone it crosses...

1062
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:58,493
Distance that changes the direction
with every turn it takes..

1063
01:31:58,664 --> 01:32:04,364
Today has turned a sweet married
life into a path of thorns...

1064
01:32:04,536 --> 01:32:11,374
Distance is that which
erases memories...

1065
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:19,076
Distance says can't move ahead
unless starting point is forgotten...

1066
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,334
l wanted to see Balu and
Mahalakshmi as a couple

1067
01:33:13,038 --> 01:33:16,030
But my dream remains unfulfilled.

1068
01:33:16,975 --> 01:33:20,035
Few dreams are like that,
they never come true, mother.

1069
01:33:21,113 --> 01:33:23,206
l wanted to see you
and father together,

1070
01:33:24,416 --> 01:33:25,883
has my dream come true?

1071
01:33:26,451 --> 01:33:27,543
This one too!

1072
01:33:32,658 --> 01:33:35,354
My son who never ever said
a harsh word to me,

1073
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:38,724
today he got angry on me.

1074
01:33:40,566 --> 01:33:44,400
So, l had to tell you everything.

1075
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:46,937
Ours is very big and wealthy family.

1076
01:33:47,105 --> 01:33:49,096
l was well educated.

1077
01:33:49,308 --> 01:33:53,745
l liked your grandfather's ideals
and his social work.

1078
01:33:53,946 --> 01:33:59,816
So l left home for your uneducated
grandpa to be with him in his village.

1079
01:34:00,152 --> 01:34:02,416
After few years, children grew up.

1080
01:34:02,588 --> 01:34:05,182
My education didn't help me.

1081
01:34:05,457 --> 01:34:10,121
l wished my children to study well
and reach good position in life.

1082
01:34:10,295 --> 01:34:13,321
l pestered him to shift to city.

1083
01:34:13,498 --> 01:34:15,625
He said he couldn't leave the village.

1084
01:34:16,101 --> 01:34:18,296
l left my home and
my family for you,

1085
01:34:18,537 --> 01:34:21,301
can't you leave this village
for me and my children,

1086
01:34:21,473 --> 01:34:22,633
l really got angry,

1087
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:26,402
l left him and came
to city with children.

1088
01:34:28,046 --> 01:34:32,176
We both waited for
each other to come,

1089
01:34:33,151 --> 01:34:35,016
we are still waiting.

1090
01:34:40,359 --> 01:34:43,522
This is first wedding invitation.

1091
01:34:44,396 --> 01:34:48,355
Both of you go together and
invite your grandfather.

1092
01:34:50,402 --> 01:34:52,063
Tell him, l've invited him.

1093
01:34:54,072 --> 01:35:00,238
Tell him, l'm not in
a position to move.

1094
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:03,577
Keep the luggage in my car.

1095
01:35:03,782 --> 01:35:05,579
Keep it in my car.

1096
01:35:07,185 --> 01:35:09,016
Please laugh!
- Why sir?

1097
01:35:09,187 --> 01:35:10,415
She cracked ajoke now!

1098
01:35:10,889 --> 01:35:13,357
lsn't it joke to travel
500 kms in auto?

1099
01:35:13,492 --> 01:35:16,256
Tell him not to pass
comments on my car.

1100
01:35:17,396 --> 01:35:19,387
l'm very happy to see you both.

1101
01:35:19,564 --> 01:35:22,590
You both are fighting just
like real man and wife.

1102
01:35:23,602 --> 01:35:26,765
What' your problem now?
ln which car to travel?

1103
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:29,304
There's a technique for it
in America.

1104
01:35:29,441 --> 01:35:32,808
lt is known as John Acharya technique.

1105
01:35:33,011 --> 01:35:35,502
Put your car keys in my pocket.

1106
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:48,653
l'll mix it now. Kittaiah, come here.
Take out a key.

1107
01:35:49,561 --> 01:35:53,657
Keep the luggage in the car.
- Okay sir.

1108
01:35:54,066 --> 01:35:59,527
Keep the luggage in the car!

1109
01:35:59,705 --> 01:36:01,502
Why are you keeping
luggage in my car?

1110
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:02,901
Your car got picked up
in the lucky dip, sir.

1111
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:06,304
Tell her to drive l'll not drive.
- Tell him to drive l'll not drive.

1112
01:36:06,478 --> 01:36:10,039
lf you keep fighting like this,
you may meet with an accident.

1113
01:36:10,215 --> 01:36:13,946
Why are you both fighting?
Since you both know each other, right?

1114
01:36:14,152 --> 01:36:18,680
Suppose if you both are strangers,
and this is your first meeting,

1115
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:22,384
and you're not Balu but Shahrukh,

1116
01:36:23,729 --> 01:36:26,220
why are you giggling?
Didn't like my idea?

1117
01:36:26,398 --> 01:36:29,390
l can't believe if you say Shahrukh.

1118
01:36:30,435 --> 01:36:33,768
You're not Mahalakshmi but Kajol!

1119
01:36:33,974 --> 01:36:37,239
lt's difficult to get convinced
that she's Kajol.

1120
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:38,641
lf it's difficult, forget it.

1121
01:36:38,812 --> 01:36:41,144
You drive for 3 hours,
and she'll drive for 3 hours.

1122
01:36:41,314 --> 01:36:43,111
But be careful with my car.

1123
01:36:56,429 --> 01:37:04,734
Do you know heart that this
bond is since time immemorial?

1124
01:37:32,499 --> 01:37:36,299
How is my car?
- Car is fine.

1125
01:37:38,371 --> 01:37:40,737
lf you're bored switch on the radio.
- Radio?

1126
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:45,944
We're listening to radio only,
sound system is awesome.

1127
01:37:46,112 --> 01:37:50,071
But l can't hear anything.
- You're far away, right?

1128
01:37:52,452 --> 01:37:55,910
Be careful, if anything happens
to the car, my heart will stop.

1129
01:38:35,795 --> 01:38:38,889
Are you mad?
l'll complain to police.

1130
01:38:39,099 --> 01:38:40,327
Police complaint?

1131
01:38:41,001 --> 01:38:43,435
Then you must definitely
know about us.

1132
01:38:58,318 --> 01:39:00,309
Can't believe it?

1133
01:39:53,139 --> 01:39:57,166
Such small incidents
do happen in big countries!

1134
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:06,510
Balu? Who is Balu? l'm Shahrukh!

1135
01:40:12,692 --> 01:40:13,681
Tell me uncle.

1136
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:16,192
So, you've entered the character.
- Yes, uncle.

1137
01:40:18,732 --> 01:40:19,721
Good couple!

1138
01:40:19,866 --> 01:40:23,632
How is the journey?
- Good uncle. But legs are paining.

1139
01:40:23,803 --> 01:40:27,398
Legs paining? How can legs pain
if you travel in car?

1140
01:40:27,574 --> 01:40:30,975
lf you want me to tell,
you must do one thing urgently,

1141
01:40:31,478 --> 01:40:33,912
catch a cab and go to
Care hospital immediately.

1142
01:40:34,581 --> 01:40:36,071
Kajol is fine, right?

1143
01:40:36,516 --> 01:40:39,417
l'm fine, you go to the
hospital immediately.

1144
01:40:43,323 --> 01:40:46,918
l've reached.
l've come into Care from car.

1145
01:40:47,093 --> 01:40:48,560
Tell me, where should l go now?

1146
01:40:48,728 --> 01:40:51,060
l'll tell you, go to the
emergency ward immediately.

1147
01:40:51,231 --> 01:40:52,596
Emergency ward? Where is it?

1148
01:40:52,799 --> 01:40:55,791
Go fast, uncle.
- l'm running.

1149
01:40:55,969 --> 01:40:58,164
l'm now in emergency ward.

1150
01:40:58,338 --> 01:41:01,432
Do you see any vacant bed?
- Vacant bed? Where is it?

1151
01:41:01,608 --> 01:41:03,473
l found one.
- Sit on it.

1152
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:06,108
Should l sit on it?
l'm sitting on it.

1153
01:41:06,279 --> 01:41:07,974
Call the doctor immediately.

1154
01:41:09,215 --> 01:41:11,740
Why three doctors?
- You called 3 doctors.

1155
01:41:12,385 --> 01:41:13,044
Doctors are here.

1156
01:41:13,219 --> 01:41:16,211
l must tell you 2 points now, uncle.
- Go ahead.

1157
01:41:16,389 --> 01:41:18,152
Point one is for you and
point two is for the doctors.

1158
01:41:18,324 --> 01:41:21,225
No need, tell me both,
l'll inform the doctors.

1159
01:41:21,394 --> 01:41:24,454
After hearing one,
you can't hear the second one.

1160
01:41:24,631 --> 01:41:26,861
Then, tell me second point first,
how's my point?

1161
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,332
Okay, switch on the speaker.

1162
01:41:31,171 --> 01:41:32,035
Tell me.

1163
01:41:33,506 --> 01:41:34,029
Tell me!

1164
01:41:34,207 --> 01:41:36,368
Uncle will get heart attack,
treat him well.

1165
01:41:36,509 --> 01:41:38,500
He's fine.
- He'll say like that only.

1166
01:41:38,645 --> 01:41:40,875
Tell me the point one now.

1167
01:41:41,981 --> 01:41:44,381
Uncle, your car is smashed!

1168
01:41:46,452 --> 01:41:48,647
Can you please do me
a small favour, Shahrukh?

1169
01:41:48,822 --> 01:41:52,553
Can you act like Balu
before my grandpa?

1170
01:41:53,126 --> 01:41:57,062
You too must do
a small favour to me, Kajol.

1171
01:41:57,230 --> 01:42:00,927
What? l must act like Mahalakshmi
before your grandpa, right?

1172
01:42:06,306 --> 01:42:08,240
l built the school here,

1173
01:42:08,374 --> 01:42:09,864
l built the hospital,

1174
01:42:10,043 --> 01:42:11,738
l built the water tank,

1175
01:42:11,945 --> 01:42:15,813
l did all this and yet you say
some Ambani is great!

1176
01:42:15,982 --> 01:42:18,815
You're great sir!
- Are you agreeing forcibly?

1177
01:42:18,985 --> 01:42:21,681
No need to fight now.
- Are you accepting to avoid fight?

1178
01:42:24,457 --> 01:42:25,890
Not you Shahrukh, but Balu!

1179
01:42:26,059 --> 01:42:28,823
l'll not donate anything for
this festival, go to hell.

1180
01:42:28,995 --> 01:42:30,360
Don't say like that sir,

1181
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:33,090
we trusted you, invited dance
troupe, and they're here too,

1182
01:42:33,266 --> 01:42:34,631
if you don't agree, we'll lose face.

1183
01:42:34,801 --> 01:42:36,268
Sir!
- What?

1184
01:42:36,436 --> 01:42:37,698
Your grandson and
grand daughter are here.- What?

1185
01:42:37,937 --> 01:42:41,168
Son's son and daughter's
daughter are here.

1186
01:42:53,219 --> 01:42:55,346
Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

1187
01:42:58,358 --> 01:43:00,223
Please open the door, grandpa.

1188
01:43:00,393 --> 01:43:02,020

Hail sir!

1217
01:45:11,924 --> 01:45:17,419
Muddula Muvva Rao's pampered
daughter matured at 18...

1218

Raja Rao's third daughter eloped
with fourth son of Pulla Rao...

1220
01:45:31,210 --> 01:45:34,611
Then there are Mangatayaru,
Gajula Chittemma, and Dubai Sathyavathi...

1221
01:45:34,747 --> 01:45:38,740
They left their husbands...

1222
01:45:38,918 --> 01:45:42,854
l can't tell their stories,
they'll narrate it themselves...

1223
01:45:43,723 --> 01:45:45,520
Dubai Sathyavathi, start it...

1224
01:45:58,905 --> 01:46:02,568
He wanted livelihood and

He told me to send money
to buy fridge and TV...

He told me to send cash
to buy double cot...

1228
01:46:22,395 --> 01:46:25,262
To keep all this he wanted a house...

1229
01:46:25,431 --> 01:46:28,923
He told me to send more
to buy in East West...

1230
01:46:29,135 --> 01:46:33,299
Thinking we're well settled,
got down from flight with great hope...

1231
01:46:33,473 --> 01:46:35,873
ln the East facing home,
on the double cot bed...

his second set up...

1233
01:46:39,278 --> 01:46:43,806
Girl, will you lend your beau?

1234
01:46:46,486 --> 01:46:51,321
Will you lend me your beau?
l'll dip him in Dubai oil well...

1235
01:46:53,826 --> 01:46:58,695
Oh no, l'll not lend my beau
or allow him to jump in oil well...

1236
01:46:58,865 --> 01:47:04,030
l'll not lend my beau
or let you dare touch him...

1237
01:47:18,184 --> 01:47:24,214
Dubai Sathyavathi rocked you,
here comes Gajula Chittemma to blast you...

1238
01:47:24,624 --> 01:47:28,390
lf he hears my anklets' sound,
he'll ask where did l go?

1239
01:47:31,397 --> 01:47:35,265
lf he hears my bangle sound, he'll ask
who are you making gestures?

1240
01:47:38,171 --> 01:47:42,073
lf man next door chokes,
he'll say l'm thinking of him...

1241
01:47:43,176 --> 01:47:46,942
lf man next door falls sick,
he'll say he's worried about me...

1242
01:47:48,281 --> 01:47:51,341
lf l say a mosquito bit me,
he'll ask if it's male or female...

1243
01:47:51,517 --> 01:47:54,918
lf l say an ant bit me, he'll ask
if it's young one or old one...

1244
01:47:55,087 --> 01:47:58,250
He'll link every man with me,
adding colourful tales to it...

1245
01:47:58,424 --> 01:48:02,451
He has put my chastity in shackles
and l'm still a virgin...

1246
01:48:02,628 --> 01:48:03,356
Poor woman!

1247
01:48:03,529 --> 01:48:08,125
Will you lend me your beau, girl?
l'll take him to the bush and come....

1248
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:15,500
Will you lend him to me?
l'll give every penny my hubby has...

1249
01:48:18,211 --> 01:48:23,012
l'll not lend my beau and
not let you get so lucky...

1250
01:48:23,182 --> 01:48:28,017
l'll not lend my beau,
l'll not let his madness rub on you...

1251
01:48:37,964 --> 01:48:42,298
l know their tales
but this girl is new.

1252
01:48:42,468 --> 01:48:44,561
She's coming at me.

1253
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:54,903
He said my waist would make
even lleanajealousy...

1254
01:48:56,148 --> 01:49:00,084
He said l'm so hot to make
even Mumaith Khan go mad...

1255
01:49:01,354 --> 01:49:05,256
He said l could make Shreya
run for her money in beauty...

1256
01:49:06,559 --> 01:49:10,427
He said l'm more worth than Anushka...

1257
01:49:11,831 --> 01:49:15,267
He saw my front and back
and went crazy...

1258
01:49:15,434 --> 01:49:18,631
He was my up and down
and he fell flat...

1259
01:49:18,771 --> 01:49:20,102
After seeing my face...

1260
01:49:20,306 --> 01:49:21,637
Seeing your face?

1261
01:49:21,807 --> 01:49:23,707
His fuse went off on seeing my face...

1262
01:49:23,843 --> 01:49:25,640
He went down in a thud...

1263
01:49:25,811 --> 01:49:28,837
He said l'm not fit for her...

1264
01:49:29,015 --> 01:49:32,644
ls it such a good face?
Why not show us also?

1265
01:49:32,818 --> 01:49:37,812
Will you lend me your beau?
l'll chew him with my eyes...

1266
01:49:39,992 --> 01:49:45,487
Will you lend me your beau?
l'll devour him with my words...

1267
01:49:47,533 --> 01:49:52,368
l'll give my beau to you,
l'm giving you my junior Shahrukh...

1268
01:49:52,538 --> 01:49:57,373
l'm giving you my beau,
l say there's no beauty than you...

1269
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:11,713
Don't give your beau...
don't give up his hand...

1270
01:50:13,926 --> 01:50:18,886
Don't give your beau...
don't make your life barren...

1271
01:50:32,678 --> 01:50:33,804
Where's my toothpaste?

1272
01:50:33,979 --> 01:50:35,310
You know l don't like this toothpaste.

1273
01:50:35,481 --> 01:50:36,948
Where did you keep my toothpaste?

1274
01:50:37,116 --> 01:50:40,313
l told you nobody must use
my toothpaste. Go!

1275
01:50:40,486 --> 01:50:43,944
She's still proud!

1276
01:50:50,329 --> 01:50:53,628
lt's false teeth!

1277
01:51:02,441 --> 01:51:05,672
Celebrating birthdays too!

1278
01:51:26,532 --> 01:51:32,869
Which button should l press
to see her again?

1279
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:42,975
Why should l come?
To see her in this condition.

1280
01:51:44,150 --> 01:51:49,247
l can't bear to see her
in this condition.

1281
01:51:52,158 --> 01:51:58,927
Look at my Mahalakshmi!
How beautiful she is!

1282
01:52:00,266 --> 01:52:05,636
l spent my life watching this,
can't l live few more years?

1283
01:52:06,272 --> 01:52:11,801
Enough, these memories are enough.

1284
01:52:35,801 --> 01:52:39,168
Want to know which button
to press to see again?

1285
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,804

What?

1288
01:52:54,088 --> 01:52:55,146
Everyone is waiting here.

1289
01:52:55,323 --> 01:52:58,656

times do l've to tell you?

1290
01:53:00,528 --> 01:53:02,655
l'll come back in a second, grandma.

1291
01:53:07,201 --> 01:53:10,170
l don't care, no company nothing,
cancel all meetings.

1292
01:53:10,338 --> 01:53:12,329
l'll take care of Prakash.

1293
01:53:13,841 --> 01:53:16,241
How are you?
- l'm fine Ajit.

1294
01:53:17,411 --> 01:53:18,378
Fine.

1295
01:53:18,879 --> 01:53:20,506
ls your grandpa doing well?

1296
01:53:20,715 --> 01:53:21,511
He's fine.

1297
01:53:27,054 --> 01:53:29,716
That's why, a special gift for you.

1298
01:53:30,925 --> 01:53:33,393
You're saying nice without
even seeing it.

1299
01:53:37,565 --> 01:53:39,760
Really nice, right?

1300
01:53:40,001 --> 01:53:43,266
You always say it, right? Say now.
- What?

1301
01:53:43,638 --> 01:53:46,402
That which you always say, please.

1302
01:53:49,043 --> 01:53:51,568
You always say Ajit is great, right?

1303
01:54:01,055 --> 01:54:02,613
Do you really like it?

1304
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:07,454
What happened, uncle?

1305
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:11,796
Balu signed contract with
a cell phone company,

1306
01:54:12,066 --> 01:54:14,296
he formulated the software
with great difficulty,

1307
01:54:14,502 --> 01:54:17,130
his friend Prakash, his partner,

1308
01:54:17,304 --> 01:54:19,602
he sold off the software
to another company,

1309
01:54:19,807 --> 01:54:22,298
cell phone company wants
to file suit on us,

1310
01:54:22,677 --> 01:54:26,272
if we don't explain in 15 days,
they'll fine us with penalty.

1311
01:54:26,647 --> 01:54:29,810
Can't pay the penalty
even if we sell everything.

1312
01:54:29,984 --> 01:54:33,010
Balu is struggling unable
to find a way out.

1313
01:54:57,411 --> 01:54:59,709
What are you all doing?

1314
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:02,110
We are regaining our application, sir.

1315
01:55:02,450 --> 01:55:03,417
Who told you to do it?

1316
01:55:03,584 --> 01:55:07,247
New program Manager...
- New program Manager?

1317
01:55:10,357 --> 01:55:13,349
Come, we were waiting for you.
We've 15 days time,

1318
01:55:13,527 --> 01:55:17,088
let get ready more advanced software
than what Prakash stole from us.

1319
01:55:17,264 --> 01:55:19,892
You guide us,
let's all work together.

1320
01:55:20,067 --> 01:55:22,968
Cell Phone Company must be
shocked with our version.

1321
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:24,601
But we don't have much time.

1322
01:55:24,805 --> 01:55:27,273
We've to work day and night.
- Who told you to come here?

1323
01:55:28,375 --> 01:55:31,310
l want to help you out.

1324
01:55:32,613 --> 01:55:34,308
l don't want anyone's help.

1325
01:55:51,499 --> 01:55:53,865
lt's Mahalakshmi here!

1326
01:55:54,502 --> 01:55:58,666
You made me an offer ofjob
if l ask at anytime, right?

1327
01:55:58,873 --> 01:56:02,673

can't you take me?

1328
01:56:03,511 --> 01:56:05,536
l'll leave if you say you can't.

1329
01:56:38,312 --> 01:56:39,574
Kajol?

1330
01:57:17,618 --> 01:57:24,182
Where's the bond?
Where's the anger?

1331
01:57:24,358 --> 01:57:27,657
Where's the distance?

1332
01:57:27,828 --> 01:57:30,023
Has it increased?

1333
01:57:31,332 --> 01:57:38,033
Only when you get yourself
into troubles...

1334
01:57:38,205 --> 01:57:44,576
Will this heart start moving?

1335
01:57:45,279 --> 01:57:52,845
Can one step wipe out the
distance created by years?

1336
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:59,789
Can one drop of rain douse the
raging fire of bad memories?

1337
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:06,763
Will the past deeds change
your fate forever?

1338
01:58:06,967 --> 01:58:14,305
Would the unfulfilled desires
become blessings now?

1339
01:58:36,964 --> 01:58:38,158
When did you come, Ajit?

1340
01:58:40,834 --> 01:58:42,165
l'll freshen up.

1341
01:58:44,204 --> 01:58:45,501
Do you know the time now?

1342
01:58:48,008 --> 01:58:51,535
l don't like you going out just
days before our marriage.

1343
01:58:52,613 --> 01:58:56,379
l can understand this
but my parents can't.

1344
01:58:56,617 --> 01:58:58,209
Stop going to office from tomorrow.

1345
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,612
Better stay at home.

1346
01:59:01,622 --> 01:59:03,214
When is our marriage?

1347
01:59:04,525 --> 01:59:05,719
Tell me.

1348
01:59:10,064 --> 01:59:12,726
So l belong to this family
till 9.29 pm,

1349
01:59:13,567 --> 01:59:16,559
ask me anything after 9.30 pm,
l'll tell you,

1350
01:59:19,206 --> 01:59:23,267
my family is in troubles,
my family needs me,

1351
01:59:24,511 --> 01:59:26,775
your parents may not be
able to understand,

1352
01:59:27,648 --> 01:59:30,811
if you understand me,
explain it to them.

1353
01:59:30,985 --> 01:59:37,823
Marriage binds husband
and wife in a bond...

1354
01:59:37,992 --> 01:59:44,659
But suitor and his future wife
relationship is by birth...

1355
01:59:44,832 --> 01:59:51,601
Difficulties make you realize
the weight of a relationship...

1356
01:59:51,772 --> 01:59:57,005
Only tears can make you fathom
the depth of a relationship...

1357
02:00:31,512 --> 02:00:38,384
Will the past left yesterday
show the way?

1358
02:00:38,552 --> 02:00:45,583
Will it take you to the shore?

1359
02:01:59,233 --> 02:02:01,724
l promised to tell you something
if l get first rank, remember it?

1360
02:02:02,936 --> 02:02:06,064
lf this project is success,
l'll tell you.

1361
02:03:15,709 --> 02:03:20,043
Before the drinks,
l want to tell you something.

1362
02:03:21,381 --> 02:03:25,078
lf l drink and then say,
it'll be like drunken blabber.

1363
02:03:28,322 --> 02:03:32,759
Lost...l've lost!

1364
02:03:35,562 --> 02:03:38,429
l had decided not to take
Mahalakshmi's help in my life.

1365
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:42,460
lf l take, it means l'm lost.

1366
02:03:44,071 --> 02:03:46,335
But this success belongs
to Mahalakshmi.

1367
02:03:47,507 --> 02:03:51,910
had she not helped us,
we wouldn't be celebrating now?

1368
02:03:53,513 --> 02:03:56,971
That's why l'm saying l've lost.

1369
02:03:58,318 --> 02:04:01,719
First time, l'm happy for losing.

1370
02:04:02,189 --> 02:04:04,157
l'm happy for losing to win.

1371
02:04:06,326 --> 02:04:07,156
Wait!

1372
02:04:10,130 --> 02:04:14,362
l promised to tell Mahalakshmi
something if l get first rank.

1373
02:04:17,170 --> 02:04:19,161
But l couldn't say that.

1374
02:04:20,741 --> 02:04:26,873
ln these moments of happiness,
l want to tell her amidst you all!

1375
02:04:43,597 --> 02:04:46,589
You challenged to make
him say that, sister.

1376
02:04:46,767 --> 02:04:49,429
You won!

1377
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:53,767
No, l never wanted to win over Balu.

1378
02:04:54,941 --> 02:04:58,433
Do you know why l came here?
- To study!

1379
02:04:59,212 --> 02:05:01,680
No, for Balu!

1380
02:05:02,816 --> 02:05:04,943
l don't like to study.

1381
02:05:05,519 --> 02:05:07,783
But still do you know
why l cried on failing?

1382
02:05:08,922 --> 02:05:11,618
Balu can't see anyone
who doesn't study.

1383
02:05:12,092 --> 02:05:13,787
That's why l worked hard to study.

1384
02:05:14,795 --> 02:05:16,626
l became his competitor.

1385
02:05:18,365 --> 02:05:20,629
l like Balu so much,

1386
02:05:21,335 --> 02:05:25,965
any girl would like to express her
first love to the man she loves,

1387
02:05:26,673 --> 02:05:32,839
but l had to say l love you to
someone else for Balu's sake.

1388
02:05:34,348 --> 02:05:35,337
Fate!

1389
02:05:37,584 --> 02:05:42,920
Do you remember when l came her
l wanted to tell Balu something?- Yes.

1390
02:05:43,123 --> 02:05:46,854
l wanted to tell him,
it's not infatuation but love.

1391
02:05:47,494 --> 02:05:50,520
But when he said it was
disturbance before everyone,

1392
02:05:51,998 --> 02:05:53,522
l couldn't bear it.

1393
02:05:54,901 --> 02:05:56,027
l left.

1394
02:05:56,937 --> 02:05:59,030
l wanted to live without Balu.

1395
02:05:59,573 --> 02:06:01,905
l tried but failed.

1396
02:06:02,209 --> 02:06:05,201
But when John uncle asked me,

1397
02:06:05,412 --> 02:06:09,906
l thought of telling l love Balu without
caring about anyone's reaction.

1398
02:06:10,751 --> 02:06:12,878
But l came to know Balu's heart
is not vacant anymore,

1399
02:06:13,053 --> 02:06:16,580
and it is occupied by a girl
2 inches taller than me.

1400
02:06:17,424 --> 02:06:21,258
Sorrow...anger about losing Balu,

1401
02:06:21,628 --> 02:06:23,755
in a fit of rage, l said okay to Ajit.

1402
02:06:24,798 --> 02:06:28,461
l'm angry on Balu as much as
l love him.

1403
02:06:29,102 --> 02:06:31,070
But when Balu was in trouble,

1404
02:06:31,204 --> 02:06:35,265
l worked hard to keep him
number one always,

1405
02:06:36,176 --> 02:06:40,135
l thought l found a place in his heart,

1406
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:42,978
when he said he'll tell me something,

1407
02:06:43,417 --> 02:06:47,217
l was expecting he would
say l like you,

1408
02:06:49,289 --> 02:06:51,314
but he said that is Mahalakshmi!

1409
02:06:54,428 --> 02:06:58,159
Tell me now have l won?

1410
02:07:02,636 --> 02:07:04,570
What happened then, sister?

1411
02:07:05,305 --> 02:07:07,000
l left that place.

1412
02:07:24,724 --> 02:07:31,391
Are you here?
Why did you leave midway?

1413
02:07:33,366 --> 02:07:35,231
Did you hear what l said?

1414
02:07:41,374 --> 02:07:43,239
That's what you wanted to hear, right?

1415
02:07:44,711 --> 02:07:46,235
Are you shocked?

1416
02:07:46,446 --> 02:07:49,108
l'm sure you'd be shocked
to hear it from me.

1417
02:07:50,283 --> 02:07:52,444
You're happy, aren't you?

1418
02:07:53,086 --> 02:07:54,280
l'm happy.

1419
02:07:54,454 --> 02:07:56,615
l'm extremely happy.

1420
02:07:57,357 --> 02:08:00,622
Our company will cross
80 crores turnover.

1421
02:08:02,162 --> 02:08:06,963
Not just 80 crores, in 6 months
it'll overtake Ajit's company.

1422
02:08:10,003 --> 02:08:11,868
Overtake Ajit's company?

1423
02:08:16,042 --> 02:08:19,011
You mean l haven't yet done it, right?

1424
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:24,340
Ajit's company is big
and mine is very small.

1425
02:08:26,186 --> 02:08:29,519
Ajit is always great to you, not me!

1426
02:08:31,658 --> 02:08:33,148
l didn't mean it.

1427
02:08:33,326 --> 02:08:36,523
l'm nothing to you, right?
Not a bit!

1428
02:08:37,731 --> 02:08:40,199
Do you know how you were
coming from village?

1429
02:08:40,367 --> 02:08:43,530
l saw your hoarding,
it was great!

1430
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:45,901
How surprized your eyes were!

1431
02:08:46,039 --> 02:08:50,135
Balu was so great and so tall!
He was in sky for you.

1432
02:08:50,277 --> 02:08:52,837
l always wanted to see
that feeling in your eyes.

1433
02:08:53,013 --> 02:08:55,447
l always Balu must be great to you.

1434
02:08:55,682 --> 02:08:57,843
When you said you'll go home,

1435
02:08:58,018 --> 02:09:01,579
you know why l stopped you,
l didn't want to lose you.

1436
02:09:01,755 --> 02:09:04,485
But what did you do?
You came first and equalled me.

1437
02:09:04,658 --> 02:09:07,252
l was afraid l would no more
be great to you.

1438
02:09:07,427 --> 02:09:10,225
That's why l cheated you to study.

1439
02:09:12,299 --> 02:09:14,961
But my bad luck,
Ajit got the first rank.

1440
02:09:15,135 --> 02:09:18,127
l compromised with you fearing
Ajit may become great.

1441
02:09:18,238 --> 02:09:21,969
l spent sleepless nights and
without food to study,

1442
02:09:22,142 --> 02:09:24,167
to make you feel again
that l'm great

1443
02:09:24,311 --> 02:09:26,211
and see the same feeling
in your eyes,

1444
02:09:26,346 --> 02:09:28,712
l did come first,
but what did you say?

1445
02:09:28,915 --> 02:09:33,147
You said Ajit is great!
lt was all over!

1446
02:09:33,486 --> 02:09:36,216
For whatever l worked hard,
everything went waste.

1447
02:09:36,389 --> 02:09:39,790
l couldn't bear it, l got angry,
l told you to leave my home,

1448
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:43,623
Ajit is great!
Those words still hurt me.

1449
02:09:43,797 --> 02:09:46,960
You may feel why am l so sensitive
if you praise someone else.

1450
02:09:47,133 --> 02:09:50,500
l look like a big egoist, right?
l look like a mad man, right?

1451
02:09:50,704 --> 02:09:55,505
Because the girl l love mustn't feel
anyone else is greater than me.

1452
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:01,379
Yes Mahalakshmi!

1453
02:10:06,052 --> 02:10:09,215
You're my life, l'm mad about you.

1454
02:10:15,228 --> 02:10:18,561
l thought you're my aunt's daughter,
where would you go away?

1455
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:22,395
l had waited 3 years for you.

1456
02:10:24,471 --> 02:10:26,769
You came to hospital that day.

1457
02:10:27,374 --> 02:10:30,935
l felt sad why grandma didn't
get a heart attack earlier.

1458
02:10:32,412 --> 02:10:36,439
When uncle asked about marriage,
l knew you'd refuse.

1459
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:38,615
That's why l said l've a girl friend.

1460
02:10:39,653 --> 02:10:42,520
Since l said that l had to
bring in Swapna.

1461
02:10:42,689 --> 02:10:45,283
Do you know who is Swapna?
She's my PA!

1462
02:10:47,594 --> 02:10:48,788
What's your height?

1463
02:10:51,765 --> 02:10:53,130
Would you like to marry me?

1464
02:10:54,267 --> 02:10:56,827
l thought you'd feel jealous
on seeing Swapna.

1465
02:10:56,970 --> 02:11:00,098
But Ajit came in much better
position than me.

1466
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:04,438
l risked my company
to upstage Ajit.
l lost everything.

1467
02:11:04,611 --> 02:11:08,012
You came and helped me out.
We succeeded!

1468
02:11:08,515 --> 02:11:13,748
But what did you say again?
The same thing Ajit is great!

1469
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,512
l've lost again.

1470
02:11:15,689 --> 02:11:20,149
l wanted to make you say l'm great
and express my love to you.

1471
02:11:20,326 --> 02:11:23,193
But l was losing every time.

1472
02:11:29,736 --> 02:11:31,829
l'm not great!

1473
02:11:32,539 --> 02:11:34,530
l'm just plain Balu!

1474
02:11:37,577 --> 02:11:40,410
You're my success and failure.

1475
02:11:42,916 --> 02:11:44,907
l'm not there without you.

1476
02:11:46,086 --> 02:11:49,578
But l don't have you anymore.

1477
02:12:03,369 --> 02:12:10,605
Like giving first rank in alms to me,
don't give your love as charity to me.

1478
02:12:29,462 --> 02:12:33,159
That's the story of
my great love failure.

1479
02:12:33,333 --> 02:12:38,032
What's this twist? The girl loves
you from the beginning, right?- Yes!

1480
02:12:38,171 --> 02:12:41,106
You felt like that, right?
- Yes, we felt like that only.

1481
02:12:41,274 --> 02:12:44,903
l love her, right? l would've
gone overboard at times,

1482
02:12:45,078 --> 02:12:46,409
little deviations in narration.

1483
02:12:46,546 --> 02:12:50,175
lf she doesn't love you,
why would she say l love you?

1484
02:12:50,350 --> 02:12:52,841
When did she say?
- After you told her.

1485
02:12:53,019 --> 02:12:55,647
After l told her.
Had l not told her?

1486
02:12:58,224 --> 02:13:02,388
lf she's not in love with you,
why did she come to help you?

1487
02:13:02,562 --> 02:13:04,291
Company belongs to family, so...

1488
02:13:04,497 --> 02:13:08,524
She helped uncle's company, right?
That's all, isn't it?

1489
02:13:08,701 --> 02:13:13,570
Tell me now, you believe
Mahalakshmi not loves me, right?

1490
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:24,478
l left my ego and told you my story,
yet no one believes me.

1491
02:13:25,018 --> 02:13:27,953
She didn't love me,
only l loved her.

1492
02:13:28,188 --> 02:13:30,656
l only had loved her,
she never loved me,

1493
02:13:30,824 --> 02:13:32,792
please believe it for my sake.

1494
02:13:32,959 --> 02:13:35,951
We believe it.

1495
02:13:36,129 --> 02:13:37,562
But l don't believe it.

1496
02:13:37,797 --> 02:13:39,992
Somebody doesn't believe it,
who is it?

1497
02:13:40,166 --> 02:13:42,634
Who are you?
Why did you come to the bar?

1498
02:13:43,269 --> 02:13:44,998
Grandpa!
- Grandpa?

1499
02:13:52,645 --> 02:13:55,045
Father! Please come.
When did you come, father?

1500
02:13:55,215 --> 02:13:58,184
What's going on here?
- Sit down, l'll explain.

1501
02:13:58,418 --> 02:14:00,352
Tell me what's going on here?

1502
02:14:01,087 --> 02:14:02,349
Balu and Mahalakshmi's marriage, father.

1503
02:14:02,522 --> 02:14:05,013
Not marriage but marriages!

1504
02:14:05,525 --> 02:14:07,686
l didn't want to come here.

1505
02:14:08,228 --> 02:14:12,221
l came to know they cheated me
by reading the invitation wrongly.

1506
02:14:12,398 --> 02:14:15,890
After coming here l came to
know they didn't cheat me,

1507
02:14:16,069 --> 02:14:18,367
infact they're cheating themselves.

1508
02:14:19,038 --> 02:14:22,906
Do you know Balu and Mahalakshmi
love each other?

1509
02:14:23,309 --> 02:14:26,142
Love? They always fight, father.

1510
02:14:26,312 --> 02:14:30,078
Did you love her or not?

1511
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:34,953
Balu loves her but
Mahalakshmi doesn't love him.

1512
02:14:35,121 --> 02:14:37,954
Don't you love Balu?

1513
02:14:38,124 --> 02:14:40,319
l told him many times but
he doesn't believe me.

1514
02:14:40,493 --> 02:14:43,223
She says she loves you,
what's your problem?

1515
02:14:43,396 --> 02:14:44,954
She says that before everyone.

1516
02:14:45,131 --> 02:14:48,259
l don't want somebody else's
love in charity.

1517
02:14:48,434 --> 02:14:50,493
Ajit is great marry him.

1518
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:52,262
Look grandpa, what is he saying?

1519
02:14:52,472 --> 02:14:54,963
lf l say Tendulkar is great,
does it mean l love him?

1520
02:14:55,141 --> 02:14:57,803
Look grandpa, she's comparing
Ajit with Tendulkar.

1521
02:14:58,011 --> 02:15:00,673
lt means he's Tendulkar
and l'm a street cricketer.

1522
02:15:00,813 --> 02:15:03,213
Don't irritate me.
l'm getting angry.

1523
02:15:03,383 --> 02:15:08,218
lt's natural for you,
since you don't love me, right?

1524
02:15:08,388 --> 02:15:11,653
ls my love infatuation?
- Look at her, grandpa.

1525
02:15:11,824 --> 02:15:14,987
Do you know what my feelings were?

1526
02:15:15,161 --> 02:15:17,288
l almost died when you touched me.

1527
02:15:17,463 --> 02:15:19,328
l feel like hugging you now.

1528
02:15:19,499 --> 02:15:22,627
Do you know how difficult it is for
me to stay away from you?

1529
02:15:24,037 --> 02:15:26,665
She's shamelessly accepting
her love publicly,

1530
02:15:26,839 --> 02:15:28,466
why don't you believe her? You fool!

1531
02:15:28,641 --> 02:15:31,872
Wait grandpa.
She's a magnet like grandma.

1532
02:15:32,078 --> 02:15:36,845
My logic is when she loves me
so much, why did she love Ajit?

1533
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:40,542
Ask her to tell me.
- Did l love him? l'll tell you.

1534
02:15:41,587 --> 02:15:44,283
When did l say okay to you?
Just before arriving in lndia, right?

1535
02:15:44,457 --> 02:15:45,719
He does not believe me.

1536
02:15:45,892 --> 02:15:48,690
Though Ajit has been proposing
for 3 years, l never cared.

1537
02:15:48,861 --> 02:15:51,421
l said okay to Ajit after you
brought home Swapna.

1538
02:15:51,597 --> 02:15:54,395
Don't believe her, grandma,
she's like grandma.

1539
02:15:54,567 --> 02:15:57,195
l don't want to marry at all,
l'm refusing even if you say okay.

1540
02:15:57,303 --> 02:16:00,898
Okay then, bring Swapna,
l'll marry her.

1541
02:16:01,107 --> 02:16:04,599
When l see you both,

1542
02:16:05,278 --> 02:16:10,113
l remember the mistake l and your
grandma committed 30 years ago,

1543
02:16:11,617 --> 02:16:14,108
we brought this situation
due to ego problems.

1544
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:20,792
How are you?

1545
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:29,158
This is our plight!

1546
02:16:30,203 --> 02:16:35,573
There's bond of marriage between us,
so we're meeting after years.

1547
02:16:35,942 --> 02:16:40,106
lf it wasn't there,
we would never meet in life.

1548
02:16:40,279 --> 02:16:43,840
At least give up your ego
after seeing us.

1549
02:16:44,717 --> 02:16:48,517
Okay, l'll give up my ego, grandpa.

1550
02:16:49,389 --> 02:16:50,754
But one condition,

1551
02:16:51,190 --> 02:16:57,356
let her say l'm greater than Ajit,
l'll believe her love.

1552
02:16:58,231 --> 02:17:00,199
No grandpa, l'll not say that.

1553
02:17:00,666 --> 02:17:03,692
lf he believes me only
if l say he's great,

1554
02:17:03,870 --> 02:17:05,531
it undermines my years of love.

1555
02:17:05,738 --> 02:17:09,071
You said Balu is great
in village, right?

1556
02:17:09,242 --> 02:17:12,268
That was my darling Kajol, grandpa.

1557
02:17:12,445 --> 02:17:14,140
l said about my sweetheart
Shahrukh, grandpa.

1558
02:17:14,347 --> 02:17:16,440
Who are these Kajol and Shahrukh?

1559
02:17:16,616 --> 02:17:19,107
The credit of crating those
characters goes to me.

1560
02:17:19,285 --> 02:17:21,913
l lost my car too in creating it.

1561
02:17:22,755 --> 02:17:25,087
Come here.
- What's it uncle?

1562
02:17:25,591 --> 02:17:27,058
Why did you slap me now?

1563
02:17:27,226 --> 02:17:30,457
Already in trouble with characters here,
are you creating new ones?

1564
02:17:30,630 --> 02:17:33,098
Did my characters create any problem?

1565
02:17:33,232 --> 02:17:37,134
Not created problems
but found solution!

1566
02:17:37,937 --> 02:17:40,462
Though lost car,
concept worked out.

1567
02:17:43,109 --> 02:17:46,806
Do you love Kajol?

1568
02:17:47,513 --> 02:17:49,310
l love her very much, grandpa.

1569
02:17:49,582 --> 02:17:53,143
Kajol has no flashback, so no Ajit.

1570
02:17:53,586 --> 02:17:56,783
Do you love Shahrukh?

1571
02:17:56,956 --> 02:18:00,824
Shahrukh is really great,
he fought and saved my life.

1572
02:18:02,795 --> 02:18:06,492
Change the boards!

1573
02:18:11,003 --> 02:18:12,994
Mahalakshmi weds Balu
Shahrukh weds Kajol

1574
02:18:15,741 --> 02:18:17,732
She looks like Mahalakshmi, grandpa.

1575
02:18:17,877 --> 02:18:19,367
Who are you?

1576
02:18:19,745 --> 02:18:22,714
lf you're Shahrukh, she's Kajol,
tie the knot!

1577
02:18:24,250 --> 02:18:25,717
Bless them!

1578
02:18:35,661 --> 02:18:38,221
l'm not Kajol but Mahalakshmi!

1579
02:18:39,765 --> 02:18:40,732
Grandpa!

1580
02:18:41,734 --> 02:18:48,264
With love to father - Sukumar

1581
02:18:49,734 --> 02:19:48,264
A PuLi - DDR Presentation ;)
