1
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:40,470
Thereexists an unique powertoearth
among allthe planets ofthe universe,that isthe gravity.

2
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:44,914
There is yet another location ontheearth
which hasthe similar gravitational force.

3
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:46,044
That is Krishna Nagar.

4
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:53,520
Many youngsters from various
places come here with a madness.

5
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:55,456
That madness is film.

00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:59,361
Some are madto become director,

00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,997
some more wantto become producers.

8
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,930
This madness is also called passion here.

9
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:10,540
They even starve to reach whatthey
dream of, sleep onthe footpath.

10
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,641
Butthey do not leave this place andtheir madness.

11
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:19,584
Many say that a bit of lucktoo is
needed alongwith bundles oftalent here.

12

14
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:37,695
He is into the search of a producerto do such
film presenting him with that Nandi award.

15
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:39,697
Let us watch what happens.

No one would kill unnecessarily man.

216
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,459
They kill for some use.

217
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,795
Now, cigarette smoking is very dangerous.

218
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:30,740

and by knowingthis adjacent flat people
are vacating and leaving sir.

236
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:10,336
Daily my wife cries over me, none from
the adjacent flat have vacated,why?

237
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,339
Enough, be quiet.

238
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:14,969
No one is coming into our flat
sayingthat devil is here

239
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:17,009
That is why we came in from America here.

240
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,448
We got Baba also alongwith us.

241
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,977
He is Kedarnath Baba staying in Himalayas.

242
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:25,489
He comes out only once in an year.

243
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:26,782
Very powerful, okay.

244
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:31,052
Here, he comes

245
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:38,028

Salutes babaji

248
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:50,740
Babaji,this is our flat.

249
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:54,352
Recently, one new devil is come in.
No advance and no rent.

250
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,650
No one is getting in due to that. You should
do something and send it out.

251
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:01,091
Sarat.

252
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:01,620
Baba,

253
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:05,460
There is soul captured inthis building.

00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,024
lt is waiting for someone to come.

255
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:12,064
lt is shouting for something itwants.

00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:21,875
lt is not soeasy to send it out.

258
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:23,778
This is not a normal soul.

259
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,950
A dreaded soul avenging for death.

260
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,714
oh God! Whatto do now?

261
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:32,616

Have we come so far for justthis small lemon?

292
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:31,603
Enough of it, keep quiet! Not forthe
lemon, but forthe devil inthat

293
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:34,508
Atthe same time, itwould have been better
ifeven youwere put into some nut.

294
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,239
Stop it!

295
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:38,213
All of us would have been dead if he had not come.

00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,107
Let us move.

297
00:23:05,544 --> 00:23:09,173
Kedarnath baba who so had captured
the devil died very badly

298
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,382
Mind blowing!

299
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,043
You meanto say that devil has
escaped fromthat lemon?

300
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:16,187
Looking atwhat Kedarnath baba
saidthis does not look like a suicide.

301
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:19,352
Did anyone killthat girl? Means, on
whom didthe soul have the revenge?

302

Dil Raju sir is notthere it seems. He is gone out
to some place. To come back, he wouldtake a week.

596
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,898
What is our position nowman?

597
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:01,562
Became like the flood victims losing shelter.

598
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:04,936
No idea man, allthe money we got is looted.
l do not knowhowto go backto village.

599
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:07,368
We should have got doubts when he saidto
do a film with two of us as heroes.

600
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,142
-5 lachs loss foreach, my dadwill noteven let me come home.

00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:19,113
Yes man! l have a doubt. How did
they believe when said as a hero?

603
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:23,359
Look man Shankar! lf our story was
taken as a film, itwould be super hit.

604
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:24,860
There is action,

605
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:30,030
over action,emotion, slowmotion, comedy

606
00:38:30,234 --> 00:38:32,099

607
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,998
Like Abbas Masthan we are the director forthis film.

608
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:39,175
After getting one hit,we can put heroes for
ourselves andtake out cinema,what do you say?

609
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:43,171
no mistake. Many directors are doingthis in Tamilnadu.

610
00:38:43,548 --> 00:38:46,813
Suppose, ifwe say our story to Dil Raju,
he willtie us in office andthrow advance.

611
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:51,354
But,who shouldwe paintthese seven days?

1581
01:39:43,049 --> 01:39:46,143
We would have vacatedthe flat by getting

1582
01:39:53,026 --> 01:39:56,484
sir, sir! l usedto stay in a single room
nearthe adjacent graveyard sir.

1583
01:39:56,963 --> 01:40:01,263
Poor girl,whenthe lady inthis flat committed suicide
and died, allwere fearingto come into this flat sir.

1584
01:40:01,568 --> 01:40:05,197

three months. By then, some bloody broker

1585
01:40:05,405 --> 01:40:08,670

cheap and you came down here.

1586

Fromthen l got stomach full of
food and stayed back here,that is all!

1591
01:40:22,956 --> 01:40:24,981
Hey, if youwant food, you should look for
some work, butwhat isthis man?

1592
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:28,450
Look at him and his Amruthanjan

Hey stop man! Will you at least believe

1599
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:43,676
This food devil may be false, but do you know,
Anjali is coming daily as a devil?

1600
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:44,501
Yes,we have seen.

01:40:44,678 --> 01:40:47,943
Hey! Stop it, stop. What isthat you are speaking

be a devil, she is like a goddess.

1603

She usedto feed me stomach fullevery

1604
01:40:53,953 --> 01:40:54,942
Do you say that girl is devil?

l have no relation with them.

1615
01:41:25,018 --> 01:41:31,548
They are strong like buffaloes. You
sip and drinktheir blood. Their flesh

1616
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:35,189
Please leave me madam! l am an innocent

Stop yourtension. l am not a devil.

1623
01:41:50,944 --> 01:41:53,146
lf you are not devil
You are surely devil.

1624
01:41:53,146 --> 01:41:55,376
Who isthat inthe photo?
Who isthat committed suicide?

1625
01:41:55,715 --> 01:41:56,272
My sister.

1626
01:41:58,418 --> 01:41:59,385
What, sister?

1627
01:42:04,524 --> 01:42:05,684
Name of my sister is Geethanjali.

1628
01:42:08,561 --> 01:42:09,459
My name is Ushanjali.

1629
01:42:10,196 --> 01:42:12,528
We are twins. Kuchipudi is our village.

1630
01:42:13,066 --> 01:42:16,126
My father is music maestro Vempati Viswanatham.

1631
01:42:17,003 --> 01:42:18,368
My sister is anexpert in music.

1632
01:42:57,977 --> 01:42:59,137
Hey you.

1633
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:05,542
As our motherexpiredwhen we were
six years of age, father grewus up

1634
01:43:06,219 --> 01:43:10,053
Sister usedto followthe Telugutraditions without fail.

1635
01:43:10,557 --> 01:43:13,958
To say the truth, sisterwas like my mother.

1636
01:43:15,428 --> 01:43:19,091
All usedto praise sayingwill girls be so in present days?

1637
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:24,296
Lookingthat fatherwas proud.
Sistertoo was welleducated.

1638
01:43:25,104 --> 01:43:28,073
She completed computer science
andwas into job at Hyderabad.

1639
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:31,438
She was soft and lwas quiet opposite to her.

1640
01:43:32,178 --> 01:43:36,376
As l got a seat in MS, left father and
sister forthe firsttime andwentto US.

1641
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:42,989
After some time knowingthat sister has committed
suicide and left us all came back againto village.

1642
01:43:43,423 --> 01:43:46,187
Village people have spread rumors on sisterwith
the same mouth they have praised.

1643
01:43:46,459 --> 01:43:54,594
They saidthat sister had a boyfriend, he raped her and has become
pregnant. They said storiesthat she committed suicide due to that.

1644
01:43:55,268 --> 01:43:58,533
Father listeningto allthese was into pain and is nowin bed.

1645
01:43:59,539 --> 01:44:02,531
Thus l startedto Hyderabadto find outthe truth.

1646
01:44:03,176 --> 01:44:04,643
Youwere knownto me then inthe bus.

1647
01:44:05,378 --> 01:44:09,314
With the thoughtthat lwould get some
clue, l came to your apartment.

1648
01:44:10,049 --> 01:44:14,486
You unexpectedly met me again. With the
reason of coffee, l usedto keep all of you busy

1649
01:44:15,121 --> 01:44:17,385
andwas searching for clues inthe house.

1650
01:44:18,091 --> 01:44:19,456
But, l did not find any clues.

1651
01:44:20,226 --> 01:44:22,660
With that lenquired inthe police station ofthis area.

1652
01:44:23,596 --> 01:44:25,461
Anjali madam! l met a friend of your sister.

1653
01:44:26,032 --> 01:44:28,523

Howhe thought a cheap about me ?

ltoo am sayingthat. Leave Anjali.

1769
01:55:21,153 --> 01:55:23,280
Madhu, Madhu, Madhu

1770
01:55:23,522 --> 01:55:27,049

1772
01:55:30,496 --> 01:55:35,661
Please, blood is going, callthe ambulance please.

1773
01:55:36,302 --> 01:55:41,069
lf youwould have shown at least 10%
ofthe love you show on him,

1774
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:45,669
both these violence and ambulance
would have not been required.

1775
01:55:45,744 --> 01:55:48,577
Madhu, Madhu, Madhu

1776
01:55:48,647 --> 01:55:50,239
Come! Show at least now, come!

1777
01:55:50,616 --> 01:55:54,484

1780
01:56:07,032 --> 01:56:08,397

Madhu,

1782
01:56:47,539 --> 01:56:48,972
Are youthinking me bad? What?

1783
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:57,615
Take this cheque and give.
Askthemtoencash it.

1784
01:56:58,684 --> 01:57:03,986
Askthem notto waste time onthe
name of courts and cases.

1785
01:57:05,758 --> 01:57:10,320
No one wouldwontedly do mistakes.
Someencourage and make them do.

1786
01:57:11,330 --> 01:57:11,659
Sir,

1787
01:57:16,368 --> 01:57:16,993
look sir.

1788
01:57:20,439 --> 01:57:21,269
What shallwe do now?

1789
01:58:10,489 --> 01:58:16,894
One more love psycho in city. A softwareemployee by
name Madhu is become close to a girl named Geethanjali.

1790
01:58:17,162 --> 01:58:22,327
He triedto bend her. As she did not
agree he raped her and killed her.

1791
01:58:22,634 --> 01:58:25,603
Police informedto have kept Nirbhaya case on him.

1792
01:58:26,071 --> 01:58:29,871
Court is orderedto shift himto Chanchalguda jail.

1793
01:58:30,542 --> 01:58:36,037
Ramesh Rao like that has used his political
power and money power and made Madhu asthe victim.

1794
01:58:36,982 --> 01:58:39,280
He made court and people believe thatthis isthe truth.

1795
01:58:40,152 --> 01:58:42,552
Madhu is being hanged soon under Nirbhaya case.

1796
01:58:53,399 --> 01:58:53,922
Madhu!

1797
01:58:56,201 --> 01:58:57,190
Allthese are my friends.

1798
01:59:12,584 --> 01:59:14,245
He fearseven for injection.

1799
01:59:17,189 --> 01:59:18,486
But nowthey are sayingto hang him

1800
01:59:29,835 --> 01:59:31,063
Whatwasthe sin done by my sister?

1801
01:59:32,004 --> 01:59:33,096
ls it not being like all.

1802
01:59:33,906 --> 01:59:40,402
lsto follow Telugutraditions, culture,
manners and allthat bull Shit?

1803
01:59:40,679 --> 01:59:42,977
Once humans usedto fear moving amongst animals.

1804
01:59:43,415 --> 01:59:46,043
But now, humans are fearingto move amongst humans.

1805
01:59:46,218 --> 01:59:50,086
All our ancient mythology books always
said how a girl should be and how she should not be,

1806
01:59:50,155 --> 01:59:51,019
should bowher headwhen she goes out

1807
01:59:51,089 --> 01:59:54,718
and rise it only after coming home.
Butwhy do they nottell allthese to boys?

1808
01:59:55,127 --> 01:59:58,585
lfeven he was saidto bend his
headwhen a girl comes across,

1809
01:59:58,897 --> 02:00:00,159
allthese crimes would not have taken place.

1810
02:00:00,599 --> 02:00:04,626
Parents who observe secretly
when a girl speaks on cellphone,

1811
02:00:04,903 --> 02:00:10,569
have they ever observe what a boy is doing sitting
night long in front ofthe computer closingthe door?

1812
02:00:11,977 --> 02:00:15,674
What belief does notexist inthe case of girls?

1813
02:00:17,182 --> 02:00:22,381
lf 10% ofthe concentration put on girls is put on boys,
so many crimes would not have happenedwith girls.

1814
02:00:22,721 --> 02:00:24,712
Many girls like my sisterwould have not been sacrificed.

1815
02:00:26,658 --> 02:00:32,426
Nirbhaya ruling does not meanto feedthe rapists
like buffalos for yearstogether and hangthen.

1816
02:00:32,998 --> 02:00:37,458
lfthey are shot immediately afterthey committhe crime
onthe mid road,then allthe idiots will come into senses.

1817
02:00:39,972 --> 02:00:42,668
My sister is dead. My father is in bedwith bad state.

1818
02:00:43,408 --> 02:00:47,640
One more innocent guy is being punished. The
one reasonable for allthis is happily enjoying.

1819
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:48,637
ls it fare.

1820
02:00:50,115 --> 02:00:52,106
Yes madam, We should not leave him like that.

1821
02:00:52,584 --> 02:00:55,144
butwe knowhis money, power and
influence. What can we do?

1822
02:00:55,487 --> 02:00:57,079
howifwe leave him so bro? We should do him Something.

1823
02:00:57,422 --> 02:00:58,980
this is not a filmto plan a revenge.

1824
02:00:59,224 --> 02:01:00,054
ifthis was a film,

1825
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:02,524
he was a villain,

1826
02:01:04,096 --> 02:01:05,563
ifwe were the writers forthat,

1827
02:01:06,064 --> 02:01:09,522
what plan wouldwe do to prove Madhu in jail
as innocent? What sketches wouldwe make?

1828
02:01:09,635 --> 02:01:12,832
What finishingwouldwe give to that Ramesh Rao?
We shall use our creativity forthat.

1829
02:01:13,572 --> 02:01:17,668
Correct bro! Let us use the passion and creativity
and see to thatthe criminal is punished.

1830
02:01:17,876 --> 02:01:21,039
Okay bro! l have an idea.i need all your help forthat.

1831
02:01:21,747 --> 02:01:23,112
we are ready.
ltoo am ready man

1832
02:01:24,182 --> 02:01:26,673
Anjali Madam! Yours isthe key role. Are you ready?

1833
02:01:27,085 --> 02:01:27,949
ltoo am ready.

1834
02:01:35,661 --> 02:01:36,559
Namaste sir.

1835
02:01:36,762 --> 02:01:38,593
you? Why did you come?

1836
02:01:40,499 --> 02:01:41,090
Where is.my son in law?

1837
02:01:42,601 --> 02:01:43,431
Madhu is not come sir.

1838
02:01:43,902 --> 02:01:45,665
As you have not helped us, he is angry with you.

1839
02:01:46,104 --> 02:01:48,572
angry? Angry even before marriage?

1840
02:01:49,675 --> 02:01:50,835
Whatexactly do you need nowman?

1841
02:01:52,144 --> 02:01:52,508
Madam.

1842
02:01:58,984 --> 02:02:00,952
why have you directly brought home the devil?

1843
02:02:02,154 --> 02:02:03,644
Why have you caught me like this man?

1844
02:02:03,789 --> 02:02:04,813
l am not devil, uncle!

1845
02:02:07,225 --> 02:02:09,159
Didthat bloody fellow do such thing?
Yes sir

1846
02:02:09,928 --> 02:02:10,986
He will not get a normal death.

1847
02:02:13,131 --> 02:02:14,189
that is in your hands sir.

1848
02:02:14,433 --> 02:02:15,491
What, do youwant me to murder?

1849
02:02:15,567 --> 02:02:18,502
No, not needed sir. Like howwe
believed Anjali madam as devil,

1850
02:02:18,737 --> 02:02:19,761
it isenough if he believes so.

1851
02:02:20,072 --> 02:02:24,202
Yes sir! He does not knowthatthese are twins.
Thus,we canthreaten him and getthe truth out sir.

1852
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:27,577
Tell me whatto do man?

1853
02:02:27,779 --> 02:02:30,976
Nothing sir. Youwould have seen
many caught by devil in your service.

1854
02:02:31,149 --> 02:02:31,808
l have seen.

1855
02:02:31,950 --> 02:02:36,148
lf youteach and give trainingto Anjali
aboutthat language and body language

1856
02:02:36,221 --> 02:02:39,520
understood, lwilltake care aboutthe rest.

1857
02:02:40,125 --> 02:02:42,491
lwill make Anjali as a devil.

1858
02:02:43,929 --> 02:02:46,489
You go and arrange forthe revenge.

1859
02:02:46,698 --> 02:02:47,892
That is, it is notthat sir.

1860
02:02:47,966 --> 02:02:49,797
Go away man
Oh man, come. Else he would again bite us.

1861
02:02:50,636 --> 02:02:51,728
What isthis.

1862
02:02:58,677 --> 02:02:59,769
Shallwe start?
Okay

1863
02:03:03,615 --> 02:03:05,606
Do you knowthe difference between human and devil?

1864
02:03:06,852 --> 02:03:08,945
yes! They do not have life andwe have.
That is it, right uncle?

1865
02:03:09,488 --> 02:03:11,513
This matterwill be said by even a kid doing urine in bed.

1866
02:03:12,024 --> 02:03:14,754
Notthat, language, body language.

1867
02:03:15,193 --> 02:03:17,787
Let us first focus onthe body language. Okay!

1868
02:03:18,463 --> 02:03:18,986
Right uncle!

1869
02:03:19,498 --> 02:03:23,093
Uncle, uncle, uncle! Do not me uncle,

1870
02:03:23,502 --> 02:03:26,096
itwould be depressing. Call me Raj.
ltwould be inspiring.

1871
02:03:26,538 --> 02:03:27,004
Okay Raj

1872
02:03:27,506 --> 02:03:28,905
Call once again
Okay Raj

1873
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:36,479
Body language of devils would be very different.

1874
02:03:37,449 --> 02:03:41,408
Whenthey come front and look itwould be crossed.

1875
02:03:43,655 --> 02:03:44,451
Come on, show!

1876
02:03:51,697 --> 02:03:54,461
What isthis, like a confused Kathak dancer?

1877
02:03:55,767 --> 02:04:00,204
Not like that. lwilltell. See me and practice. Okay?

1878
02:04:00,605 --> 02:04:01,128
Okay raj.

1879
02:04:02,507 --> 02:04:03,599
Bendthe head like this.

1880
02:04:05,077 --> 02:04:06,101
