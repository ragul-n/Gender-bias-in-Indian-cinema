Sir

22
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,829
Lieutenant Kaalia, carry out detailed
survey with this patrol

23
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,822
News is that a few rats have crossed
over into our territory from the LOC

24
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:12,431
lf you notice any suspicious activity,
get in touch with me immediately...

25
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,429
and pass me the information

26
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:18,400
Not to worry, sir. We'll crush the rats
and push them back across the LOC

27
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:20,310
Good. All the best

28
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:23,071
Thank you, sir

29
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:43,432

00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:19,425

Get me Brigade headquarter

35
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,283
Alfa to Tiger come in... over

36
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,253
Sir, l've a problem. Not been able
to establish radio contacts with...

37
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,528
both my patrols for last two weeks

38
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:48,999
There is absolutely no news of them.
This is the cause of worry, sir

39
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:52,235
Now you do one thing Colonel.
Wait for my further order

40
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:54,232
And please don't send anymore
search parties

41
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,507
Let me talk to higher command.
And l'll get back to you

42
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:58,569
Over and out.
- Over

43
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,514
What happened?
- lt was an ambush, sir

44
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:08,953
lt was so dark,
couldn't tell where the enemy was...

45
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,552
The Mujahidins and the Pakistani troops
have crossed the LOC...

46
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:53,030
and intruded several kilometers
into our territory

47
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,060
From this information, it looks like
they're all over the place

48
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:01,838
The Muskoh valley, the Dras sector
and the Batalik sector

49
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,372
They've taken over
the whole lndian territory

50
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,339
And they have occupied
our bunkers too

51
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:09,240
The rations our troops had
left behind in the bunkers...

52
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:11,344
is what they're feeding off
to attack us!

53
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:13,915
The problem is that they're watching
the National Highway number one...

54
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:16,187
through point 4875,
Tololing and Kukarthang...

55
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:18,422
and continuously shelling
our convoys

56
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,916
Situation is very serious.
Connect me to Delhi

57
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:22,193
Right, sir

58
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,261
Sir, the enemy plan is simple.
To cut of Kashmir from Ladak...

59
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,535
by hitting
national highway number one

60
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,506
Orders from Delhi are very clear

61
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:45,507
The maximum mobilization
must take place in the Kargil sector

62
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:49,282
Orders are to press maximum number
of battalions into service

63
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:54,524
And as we know, with the enemy sitting
up there at an advantageous position...

64
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,460
requiring us to attack them
from down below...

65
00:06:57,896 --> 00:07:00,126
So the ratio will be 6:1

66
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:02,959
We'll lose six, They'll lose one

67
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:08,067
And Kargil terrain is such,
where the ratio will be 10:1

68
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:12,468
And that the reason why
maximum mobilization is taking place

69
00:07:12,944 --> 00:07:15,504
Sir, let us cross the LOC and cut off
the enemy from behind

70
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,811
So that we lose less lives

71
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:22,385
We'll get into Pakistani territory
and cut off all their lines of supply

72
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:25,379
No Brigadier.
The orders are very clear

73
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:27,484
That we'll be going by the book

74
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:32,191
At no point of time, we'll cross
the line of control

75
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:34,465
These are the clear instruction
from Delhi

76
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,261
And so, let's move
1/11 Gurkha Regiment first

77
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,868
But the 1/11 Gurkha Regiment has
just returned from Siachen, sir

78
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:43,868
Can't help it. They are
the best fighters for this area

79
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:46,608
Colonel Lalit Rai will take command
of the 1/11 GR

80
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:48,170
Let me talk to him

81
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,244
Colonel Lalit.
- Sir?

82
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:54,518
You are required to proceed to
Yaldor Kargil sector immediately

83
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:59,318
And take charge of 1/11 Gurkha Regiment.
- Yes, sir

84
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:02,888
We'll make arrangements to drop you
at Yaldor within 24 hours

85
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:05,796
l'll be there, sir

86
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:24,310
Jai Hind, sir

87
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,211
27 Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs)
& 470 other ranks at your command, sir!

88
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:32,149
Battalion ! Don't move!

89
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:44,399
Sir! 3 officers, 27 JCOs and 470
other ranks at your command!

90
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:45,836
Okay

91
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:53,066
Battalion ! At ease!

92
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,538
Praised be Goddess Kali!

93
00:08:58,049 --> 00:08:59,949
Here come the Gurkhas!

94
00:09:00,885 --> 00:09:05,117
The Gurkha regiment
is known for its bravery!

95
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:12,793
My brave friends, battle and
bloodshed aren't unknown to us

96
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:17,323
We saw Kashmir
bathed in blood recently!

97
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:22,863
The Gurkha regiment is famous
all over the world

98
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:26,503
Even Hitler had once said...
''lf l can have the Gurkha troops...''

99
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:33,814
''l can conquer the entire world''

100
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,817
And, as your Commanding Officer...

101
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:42,491
Lalit Rai wants to see you
victorious in Kargil!

102
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,495
Any doubts...?

103
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,021
None, sir!

104
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:48,456
Praised be Goddess Kali!

105
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,026
Here come the Gurkhas!

106
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:52,935
Battalion mount

107
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,281
Message from the Command, sir

108
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,015
Colonel Thakur, move your Battalion

109
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,094
18 Grenadiers to Kargil Dras sector
immediately

110
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,598
Stop all operation in Kashmir valley
and proceed immediately

111
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:56,066
Right, sir

112
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,476
Run, Suleman ! Run !

113
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:29,259
Let go! Let go!

114
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:34,302
You've had a narrow escape

115
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:37,097
Had you got into it,
you'd have been taken too

116
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:39,342
Scared, aren't you?

117
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:42,306
He was armed to his teeth.
He could've killed you

118
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:45,343
And l'm a Maratha... a real man

119
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,242
We don't get scared.
We give others a scare

120
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:49,543
And l'm a Jat from Haryana.
l only hit out

121
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:51,420
That's the problem with you

122
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:54,591
Pig-headed guys.
You won't ever use your brains

123
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:57,889
Hail Maharashtra

124
00:11:58,196 --> 00:11:59,220
Hail Haryana

125
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:02,491
Sachin... stop fighting, guys

126
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,401
Word is that all the operations
in the valley have been called off

127
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,532
And Battalion is moving
forward to Dras sector

128
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,174
Come on

129
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,036
Relax

130
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,846
Soldiers, l have received orders

131
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:27,456
The Tololing glacier, which is our
territory and on which we have a post...

132
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:32,419
has been captured by the enemy.
From there....

133
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:36,355
the enemy is keeping a watch on
National Highway number one

134
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:40,466
They are monitoring every move
our convoys are making...

135
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:44,397
and keeping an eagle's eye
on their activities

136
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:50,306
lt's very necessary for us
to eject the enemy from there

137
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:53,983
We've got to launch
an attack on them

138
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:58,217
They sent a couple of battalions
up there

139
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,252
The 16 Grenadiers are presently
engaged in combat over there

140
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,494
The task is now being
entrusted to us...

141
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:08,423
and Head Quarters
wants us to accept it

142
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,832
As if there are only a dozen
Jihadis sitting out there!

143
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:14,505
The Naga battalion has
already got there, sir

144
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:20,375
Something is surely fishy, sir.
Nobody's telling us the whole truth

145
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:25,308
lf we are issued orders, we'll
definitely launch an offensive, sir

146
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,347
But the enemy's at such a height,
every grenade they hurl at us...

147
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,587
will come down at lightning speed, sir.

148
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:34,425
Besides, we have no information
about the enemy, sir

149
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:36,189
Are they 8 in number or 800 ?

150
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:38,419
Even if there are
8000 troops out there...

151
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:42,423
they've gotten into our house!
And we'll surely throw them out sir!

152
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,424
Easier said than done!

153
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:47,867
lf we're a family,
you're like the father among us

154
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:52,164
So why are you thrusting us
to the path of cowardice?

155
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,441
And that too, blindfolded!

156
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,813
When a child walks through
a dark alley...

157
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:04,819
he sings and whistles,
out of fright

158
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:07,891
We'll go out singing too, sir

159
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,824
The same old song
my mother keeps humming

160
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:14,865
''So lover boy...''

161
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:17,234
''tell me the truth...
what's going to happen?''

162
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:20,231
Sir...wrong grammar sir.

163
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:23,432
Are you here to win the war
or correct my language...?

164
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:33,043
Sir, let us have your orders.
The battalion is ready

165
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:36,383
Eighteen Brigadiers...

166
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:39,178
The mighty heroes!

167
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,421
The mighty heroes!

168
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,585
Colonel Baba, listen...

169
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:47,862
move your Battalion 17 Jat
to Kargil sector immediately

170
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,587
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind

171
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:12,956
Relax Anuj. Sit down.
Catch your breath

172
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:14,950
Thank you, sir

173
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,492
Where did you steal the ice?

174
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:25,529
What else can one steal here?

175
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:28,494
lt's either the splendour of nature
or the chill of ice

176
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,339
Never said the true word

177
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:34,067
Now tell me...
what happened in the mission?

178
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:37,514
There were four of them, sir.
All Afghan tribals

179
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:40,984
Three of them used the cover of women
and children to escape...

180
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:43,082
but l nabbed the fourth one

181
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:45,447
You must have interrogated him then?
- l did, sir

182
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,188
But he kept crying
and saying just one thing

183
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,551
''For God's sake, shoot me''
- Why?

184
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:55,431
He said that if he lived, people of
his militant group would kill him

185
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,500
But if he died, his wife and kids
would be paid 300,000 rupees

186
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:02,462
So it was,
''Shoot me, for God's sake''

187
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,469
l asked him
who would pay them the money...?

188
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,402
and he said, the militant group

189
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:11,440
Sir, the mujahidins of Afghanistan have
got as far as the Pir Punjab, sir

190
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:14,976
A lot of movement is being observed
in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, sir

191
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,819
We must inform Brigade headquarter.
- That we'll do, Anuj

192
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:21,391
The Battalion is moving to Mathai.
Kargil sector

193
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:24,225
Kargil? Trouble area?

194
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:28,991
You'll have a lot of chances
to catch terrorists today...

195
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,835
and we'll get to squeeze the trigger

196
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,004
Of course, Anuj.
Let's go

197
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:46,176
Jai Hind, sir

198
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:50,110
Deepak, you still had some
leave to go, didn't you?

199
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:52,283
l had leave, all right sir

200
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:55,288
But l alone know
how l've spent it

201
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:56,389
What happened?

202
00:16:56,694 --> 00:17:00,391
The coffin of a soldier arrived kept
arriving in the village every other day

203
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:03,459
They were mostly from
the Sikh Battalion, sir

204
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:06,802
Deepak, our Battalion is headed to
where these coffins are coming from

205
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,436
lt's to avenge those coffins that
l've returned before time, sir

206
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:13,139
Deepak sir... the enemy will
now lie in coffins

207
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:14,511
Let's hope so

208
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,572
Major Joshi. Joe.
- Yes, sir

209
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:19,982
You have been promoted
as Lieutenant Colonel

210
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,412
Thank you, sir.
l hope l deserve it, sir

211
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:25,412
You take command of
13 J&K Rifles Battalion

212
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:28,154
l go to be the commanding officer
of Battalion, sir

213
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:29,426
That's right.
- Right, sir

214
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,418
Things here at Kargil are pretty bad

215
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:33,489
Now your task, move to Kumri,
Kargil sector

216
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:35,329
Right, sir.
Thank you, sir

217
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,074
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind

218
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:54,178
Ajay, all the operations in the valley
have been cancelled

219
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:56,483
The battalion's moving towards
the Dras sector

220
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:59,856
Where's Vikram Batra?
- He had gone with the patrol party

221
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:02,415
We had information that some
terrorists were holed up...

222
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:04,457
in a village five kilometers from here.
He had gone after them

223
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:06,456
When did he go?
- Four days ago

224
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:09,231
Four days...?
What the hell!

225
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,431
Did you try to contact him?
- Of course, Vikas...

226
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:15,203
l sent a patrol party. But by the time
they got there, he had already left

227
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,806
0 And the idiot didn't even try
to get in touch with us

228
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:23,001
l hope the patrol party is okay!
Their security is our responsibility

229
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:26,209
Let's get him on the radio

230
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:31,287
We've reached base-camp...
Message over

231
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:39,219
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings

232
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:41,326
Sir, Vikram-saab has arrived!

233
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:48,428
Hey Superman...!
Thank God you're okay

234
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:51,205
Where the hell were you?
- Where...? Here l am

235
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,238
Vicky! We were all so worried

236
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:55,342
Know what?
Major Vikas is fuming inside

237
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:57,479
Where did you slip away?
- lt's the terrorists who slipped away

238
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:59,315
The places l looked for them!

239
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:04,486
Dimwit! People run away from trouble...
and you go looking for it!

240
00:19:05,022 --> 00:19:08,480
lt's a man's calling to face trouble,
not to run away from it

241
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:09,960
You are crazy

242
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:13,123
What's all the preparation for?
Where's the battalion going?

243
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:17,194
Kargil. Dras sector.
There's said to be some problem there

244
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:20,803
That's nice. l won't have to go
hunting for it anymore

245
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,131
l'll go and report.
- Okay

246
00:19:23,874 --> 00:19:24,841
Relax

247
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:46,223
Enough, enough...

248
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:49,957
Thanks a lot

249
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,100
How are you doing, Ramesh Kumar-ji?
- l'm okay

250
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:02,445
Greetings!

251
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,505
Greetings!

252
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:05,508
Sanjay, you've returned
early this time?

253
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,373
Yes, l went to your house too

254
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,109
Your wife sent some laddoos.
Will give them to you later

255
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:11,447
You asked about my mother?
- She's all right

256
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:13,516
Welcome, Sanjay...
- How are you?

257
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:16,552
So your mother finally
put shackles in your feet?

258
00:20:17,027 --> 00:20:19,495
Oh yes, she found a bride
for me this time

259
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:22,991
So... what else is happening?

260
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:26,195
What else? Major Joshi is here too

261
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,667
The Major has returned?

262
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,437
You mean, he has returned from the
advanced-post in Shahjahanpur?

263
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:37,141
l got a feeling from the news on radio
that this is serious business

264
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,286
Sit down.
- Sir

265
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,552
All ready?
- Raring to go, sir

266
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:50,994
Good

267
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:54,494
Our information is that there's just
a handful of jihadis holed up there...

268
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:56,900
so why move the whole battalion?

269
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:02,838
Whether this is minor trouble or major,
we'll know only when we get there

270
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:05,269
Sir, when do we move?

271
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:08,511
We have to reach Kumri in 48 hours.
- We'll be ready, sir

272
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:10,313
Let's move

273
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:33,527
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings

274
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:35,872
Relax

275
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,476
Sanjay, you returned early
from your vacations?

276
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:46,474
Yes, sir. As soon as l got to know that
the battalion is marching forward...

277
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,885
l came away immediately

278
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:51,553
Raghunath...
- Yes, sir?

279
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:54,220
Any letter from home?
How's your mother keeping?

280
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:56,148
She's all right, sir

281
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:03,264
Soldiers! My friends...

282
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:08,099
when l was a child, we used to live
in a mansion outside the village

283
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:13,399
Whenever we had a guest,
we extended our hospitality to him

284
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:16,443
Even when someone came
uninvited...

285
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,144
we still treated him to food
and sent him away

286
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:22,443
When an animal strayed
into our colony...

287
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:25,184
we drove it away with a stick

288
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,015
But whenever a cheetah
or a wolf came preying...

289
00:22:29,893 --> 00:22:31,861
we always shot it dead

290
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,194
Something similar has happened
in our house today

291
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:38,867
A pack of wolves
have got into our house

292
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:43,395
You tell me...
how are they to be treated?

293
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:45,140
Kill them!

294
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,040
That's what we're going to do.
So give me your word

295
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:55,043
That we will not return,
until we have accomplished our task

296
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:58,884
Are you firm in your resolve?
- Yes, we are firm in our resolve!

297
00:23:04,528 --> 00:23:06,496
''Brother dear, this is an
amazing thing to happen''

298
00:23:06,864 --> 00:23:08,456
''The laddie is playing bridegroom''

299
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:11,232
''He leads the
bridal procession...''

300
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:13,502
''sending a shiver down
every spine''

301
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:17,432
So bridegroom... you're here?
- You... are the limit!

302
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,343
This is the first time you're meeting me
after your marriage

303
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:23,546
So how was it?
- What?

304
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:26,345
The marriage! What else?

305
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:28,508
lt was the way it was supposed to be

306
00:23:28,886 --> 00:23:31,081
Mom found a bride for me
and l got married, that's it

307
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:33,180
How's the bride?

308
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,017
Nice

309
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:36,853
Beautiful?

310
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:39,862
Now, beauty lies in the eyes
of the beholder...

311
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:43,259
So she's beautiful!

312
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:46,263
You've brought a picture?

313
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:47,562
Yes

314
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,370
Where is it?

315
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:51,340
ln my heart

316
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,871
How about her memories?
- They're in my heart too

317
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:58,040
So what have you
brought for me, buddy?

318
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:01,117
Sweetmeats.
- Where is it?

319
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:03,315
ln the hold-all. Help yourself

320
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:07,046
Very good. l thought you'd say
it's all in the tummy!

321
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,257
Now come to the point

322
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:16,833
So soldier Yogendra Singh Yadav...
- Well?

323
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,393
How did the nuptial night go?
- Forget it...

324
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:21,838
Tell me!

325
00:24:23,874 --> 00:24:25,000
Fantastic!

326
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:29,968
You...

327
00:24:31,582 --> 00:24:35,279
Jerk! You were the one who got married
and l got almost killed

328
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:36,245
How come?

329
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:39,285
You're Yogendra Singh Yadav.
So am l

330
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,457
You belong to the 18 Grenadiers,
so do l

331
00:24:43,026 --> 00:24:46,120
l got a congratulatory note
for the wedding

332
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,464
l'm glad it came here to me.
Had it fallen in my wife's hands...

333
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:54,564
she'd have cried,
''My husband has got married again !''

334
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:58,473
She'd have left for this place
with a stick...

335
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:01,275
and poor me would have taken
all God gave me!

336
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:03,809
You'd have got a nice beating
from your wife!

337
00:25:10,554 --> 00:25:14,217
The nuptials were okay, you know.
ln fact, it was all very nice

338
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:21,223
But when l woke up early in the morning,
l had a terrible nightmare

339
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:22,632
What?

340
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:26,366
l saw some people trying to snatch
the national Tricolour from my hands

341
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,332
But Yadav-boy... l just wouldn't
let go of the flag

342
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:32,439
l thrashed them all on my own
and drove them away...

343
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:35,436
Your dreams are as black
as your tongue!

344
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:38,342
Your dream has come true

345
00:25:38,882 --> 00:25:41,646
Not you alone, we're all going together
to save the Tricolour

346
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:45,521
Do what you will.
- What's to be done...? What?

347
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:49,254
We'll thrash them with this very flag
and shove them across the border

348
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,323
We'll send them back to
where they came from!

349
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:54,430
We've seen the peacock dance

350
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:57,264
We've seen the heaviest of fogs

351
00:25:57,568 --> 00:26:01,265
And now the drains tell the sea...
learn to rage!

352
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:04,439
We've seen what noise
the showers can make!

353
00:26:07,544 --> 00:26:10,104
''Brother dear, this is an
amazing thing to happen''

354
00:26:10,547 --> 00:26:12,947
''The laddie is playing the bridegroom''

355
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,916
Shut up, will you...? Shut up!

356
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:28,224
l hear there's a lot of tension there.
- Maybe God has given me an opportunity

357
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:30,992
To sacrifice my life in order
to protect my friends...

358
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:33,226
Don't you dare heap curse
on my beloved...

359
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:35,835
that too, before we are married.
- Okay, okay...

360
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:39,131
l'll never say such a thing again.
l'll come back and marry you

361
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:43,403
You and l will then talk about
giving birth to babies... okay?

362
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,847
Go away!

363
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:55,251
Where's the battalion?
- My battalion has left for Kargil

364
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:58,261
l'm told there are signs
of an impending war there

365
00:26:58,895 --> 00:27:00,385
l'm a soldier, after all

366
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:04,129
And only the fortunate soldiers
get to see action on the battlefield

367
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:09,199
Whenever you talk about battle...
my heart begins to sink

368
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:22,808
Don't you dare, Mrs Yadav...
you will not shed a single tear

369
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:26,113
l want to carry memories
of your smiling face with me

370
00:27:26,857 --> 00:27:27,824
Smile now...

371
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:30,822
Go on... smile...

372
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:48,970
Yogesh...

373
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:55,210
you thought you could go away
just like that?

374
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:57,849
l thought you were asleep

375
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:00,783
l knew you'd be leaving
early in the morning...

376
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:04,426
so l couldn't go to sleep all night.
l heard everything

377
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:07,429
You got up, went to the bathroom...

378
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:11,300
took a shower, dressed and were
about to sneak out like a thief

379
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:14,060
l didn't want to disturb anyone

380
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:17,200
lf Eshita had woken up,
she wouldn't have let me leave

381
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,476
But you'd still have gone away.
To your other family

382
00:28:20,944 --> 00:28:24,209
l have just one family.
The soldiers in my battalion...

383
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:27,210
you and Eshita.
- And whose support do l have?

384
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:30,816
You have a protector.
The one in the temple... Lord Krishna

385
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:33,248
As if He won't protect
your battalion !

386
00:28:33,557 --> 00:28:37,823
Why not? He always chooses a medium
to do what He wants to do

387
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:40,829
And l think, l'm the one
He has chosen

388
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:44,099
All right... but do take care
of yourself

389
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:46,333
Don't worry.
Nothing can happen to me

390
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,262
l won't let it either!

391
00:28:48,572 --> 00:28:51,132
Even if death comes calling...
l'll confront it

392
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,270
Really...? How?

393
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:55,511
Like this!

394
00:28:58,382 --> 00:28:59,349
Papa...

395
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:01,779
come back soon. Okay?

396
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:21,393
Hey Sanjay...
why the long face?

397
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:24,136
Aunt, my battalion
has left Sopore...

398
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:27,409
for Kargil.
l've got to leave too

399
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:30,438
No, son. Your uncle died
in the war of '65...

400
00:29:30,914 --> 00:29:32,381
and now you...?

401
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:36,478
lf something happens to you,
it'll be the end of this family

402
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:39,251
Mine is a huge family, Mother

403
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:42,286
The entire lndian army
is guarding it

404
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,184
lf not now, when again will l
go to defend my motherland?

405
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:50,265
Give me your blessings.
And see me off with a smile, okay?

406
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,095
All right, son

407
00:29:56,573 --> 00:29:57,540
Oh, you...?

408
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:00,837
Santo...

409
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:03,943
Wait, Santo

410
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:09,351
Listen... listen...

411
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:12,454
l've heard everything

412
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:16,958
And so the coward
adorns her eyes with tears already?

413
00:30:17,494 --> 00:30:20,258
All right, l'm a coward.
Not someone brave like you...

414
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,498
to send you to face the gun
with a smile

415
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,864
Nothing will happen to me, silly

416
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:27,461
Your love is a shield
l'm wearing

417
00:30:28,605 --> 00:30:30,869
You're trying to humour me...?
- No

418
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,676
l promise, l will return

419
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:36,538
lf not for anyone else...

420
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:38,537
it'll be only for you

421
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:44,079
Do come. lf something happens to you,
the world will call me a witch...

422
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:46,582
who swallowed her fiance

423
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:49,582
You're so worried about
the world, aren't you?

424
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:54,153
My world begins and ends with you

425
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:03,268
This time l'm serious.
Serious about you

426
00:31:04,608 --> 00:31:05,575
l swear

427
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:07,840
Look in my eyes and tell me

428
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:10,910
lf you think l'm lying,
you may go away

429
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:17,285
What do you plan to do in life?
- Join the army

430
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:19,484
Why army?

431
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:23,859
Because a soldier lives by chance,
loves by choice...

432
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:26,457
and kills by profession

433
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:31,261
l'm very impressed, Mr Vikram Batra

434
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:37,130
You know, Mitthu? An officer has to
spend most of his time on the borders

435
00:31:37,674 --> 00:31:39,266
Will you be able to live with that?

436
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,878
Don't you think
you are moving too fast?

437
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:45,381
l want this relationship to be more
than a mere friendship

438
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:49,449
l want to give our friendship a name...
will you be able to live with it?

439
00:31:51,922 --> 00:31:55,289
Now you look in my eyes and tell me...

440
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:58,360
what do they say?

441
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,233
Mr Anuj Nayyar.
- Excuse me. Lieutenant Anuj Nayyar

442
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:13,399
l'm sorry.
- Yeah ! You better be sorry

443
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:17,173
Never call me mister, okay?
- Hey!

444
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:20,509
You're already fighting with me!
What will happen in the future?

445
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:24,544
What? lf it comes to the worst, we'll
have a bad anniversary photograph

446
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:29,256
Excuse me.
Are you proposing to me?

447
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:32,426
l don't know.
l'm l?

448
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:36,464
Well yeah, l suppose l am

449
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,238
So, yes or no?

450
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:48,878
Lieutenant Anuj Nayyar,
you are an officer

451
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:50,874
Behave like one

452
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:54,173
Get down on your knees
and ask for the lady's hand

453
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:58,588
Yes, ma'am

454
00:33:06,563 --> 00:33:08,258
Will you marry me, please?

455
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,058
Yes l will

456
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,438
Show me where the burn is

457
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:22,401
Forget it, Mother. lt's nothing.
- Show it to me...

458
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:26,505
Good God! Want me to apply
some cream on it, son?

459
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:31,454
Mother, your son's joining the army
where huge bombs are going to explode

460
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:33,446
Will you come to kiss his hand there?

461
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,552
When you say such things,
l feel very scared, son

462
00:33:37,427 --> 00:33:38,325
Mother...

463
00:33:38,628 --> 00:33:42,189
Here comes my support.
Our neighbour!

464
00:33:42,932 --> 00:33:47,096
My child, l could've made some tea
for you, if you had come a bit earlier

465
00:33:47,404 --> 00:33:49,429
Look at him...
he has burnt his hand

466
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:51,032
Where?
- Lay off!

467
00:33:51,307 --> 00:33:54,071
Ever so eager to hold my hand.
- Show it to her

468
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:57,312
No, Mother.
l'll have to wait to take his hand

469
00:33:57,614 --> 00:34:01,482
What does that mean?
- He knows what l'm talking about

470
00:34:02,018 --> 00:34:05,283
He won't let me do
anything for him

471
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:10,822
He makes the tea on his own.
He himself heats the water for a shave

472
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:13,562
He sews the buttons on his shirt

473
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:16,430
And he uses a brush to
string his pajamas

474
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,424
And if l'm not looking...

475
00:34:18,902 --> 00:34:22,167
he will himself sit down
and wash his own clothes

476
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:24,473
Well? Why must you do
everything on your own?

477
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:28,469
Mother, you did everything for me
till l grew up

478
00:34:28,912 --> 00:34:31,847
Now when l can do it on my own,
why must l make you do it?

479
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:37,046
General Manoj Pandey, some chores
are meant only for women

480
00:34:37,353 --> 00:34:41,517
Absolutely right!
Bring home a daughter-in-law

481
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:44,856
lt'll make you happy and my
burden will be taken care of too

482
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,363
Where do you find such
daughters-in-law nowadays, mother?

483
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:51,566
We do. l've even found someone.
- Really?

484
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:54,400
l approve of her.
- Who's she?

485
00:34:54,904 --> 00:34:57,464
Mother, don't utter one name please.
That's Hema

486
00:34:57,907 --> 00:35:00,307
Else, it'll ruin your son's mood
l must leave now

487
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,804
Where to?

488
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:07,844
l've kept some lentils on the stove.
l'll wait till the broth is cooked!

489
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:12,817
lsn't she nice?
She's crazy!

490
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:04,466
''The boundaries beckon you...
walk on, O traveler''

491
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,306
''The borders summon you...
March on, O soldier''

492
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:10,806
''The boundaries beckon you...
walk on, O traveler''

493
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:13,805
''The borders summon you...
March on, O soldier''

494
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:49,511
''Although you are leaving...''

495
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:52,520
''you must come back''

496
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:55,990
''Someone waits for you...''

497
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:58,958
''don't ever forget''

498
00:36:59,462 --> 00:37:02,192
''Without you, every moment
l shall spend in agony...''

499
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:04,966
''tormented by separation''

500
00:37:05,602 --> 00:37:09,936
''With you, O soldier,
''My heart... my heart''

501
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:21,379
''The boundaries beckon you...
walk on, O traveler''

502
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:23,944
''The borders summon you...
March on, O soldier''

503
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:41,503
''Although you are leaving...''

504
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:57,835
''lf you and l are not together...''

505
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:03,783
''the festival of Holi
shall be bereft of colour''

506
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:10,221
''Colder than ice,
darker than charcoal...''

507
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:16,356
''shall be the festival of Diwali,
without you''

508
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:26,202
''The clouds will learn
to shed tears''

509
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:32,344
''The showers will only cause a fire,
and pining...''

510
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:37,809
''and what shall yearn
to have the fires sated...''

511
00:39:38,855 --> 00:39:43,952
''is my heart... my heart''

512
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:48,391
''The boundaries beckon you...
walk on, O traveler''

513
00:39:48,865 --> 00:39:51,527
''The borders summon you...
March on, O soldier''

514
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,834
''Although you are leaving...''

515
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:47,111
''The rooms in our house,
our courtyard and doorstep...''

516
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:53,287
''they shall eagerly await you too''

517
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:59,920
''Your chair shall remain bare...''

518
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:05,968
''the flowers will remain thirsty''

519
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:15,442
''The whole family
shall yearn to see you''

520
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:21,975
''This courtyard shall call out to you
with its arms spread...''

521
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:27,045
''wherever you go,
my heart-beat will go with you...''

522
00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:32,857
''and my heart... my heart''

523
00:42:35,298 --> 00:42:38,199
''The boundaries beckon you...
walk on, O traveler''

524
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:40,966
''The borders summon you...
March on, O soldier''

525
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:51,436
''Although you are leaving...''

526
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:54,178
''do come back...''

527
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:57,477
''that someone waits for you...''

528
00:42:57,987 --> 00:43:00,387
''don't ever forget''

529
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:03,484
''Without you, every moment
l shall spend in agony...''

530
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,428
''tormented by separation''

531
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:11,457
''With you, O soldier,
goes my heart''

532
00:43:13,102 --> 00:43:17,835
''My heart... my heart''

533
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:22,974
''The boundaries beckon you...
walk on, O traveler''

534
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:25,839
''The borders summon you...
March on, O soldier''

535
00:44:06,956 --> 00:44:07,854
Jai Hind, sir

536
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,081
There's shelling taking place ahead.
Please be careful, sir

537
00:44:11,594 --> 00:44:13,494
Convey the message to the convoy.
Be on alert

538
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:16,489
There's shelling ahead...
Watch your step

539
00:44:45,628 --> 00:44:48,995
Here you are, Manoj.
- Thank you, sir

540
00:44:49,298 --> 00:44:50,959
What are you thinking about?

541
00:44:55,604 --> 00:44:59,267
This can't be the work
of mere infiltrators, sir

542
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:04,479
To blow up an ammunition pile
and the TV tower with artillery...

543
00:45:05,047 --> 00:45:08,312
the artillery fire's all coming from
the Pakistani's, isn't it sir?

544
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:11,853
Your guess is right, Manoj

545
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:16,286
But you must save your anger
and your strength for the enemy

546
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:21,223
l'm only angry with myself, sir

547
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:24,959
How did the enemy cross the LOC
and get in, in the first place?

548
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:27,326
There were a few bunkers
lying vacant on the LOC

549
00:45:27,636 --> 00:45:30,230
Since the owners weren't around,
they seemed up for grabs

550
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:36,170
That's all right, sir.
Even if the milk isn't covered...

551
00:45:37,913 --> 00:45:40,381
the dog must know where to stop

552
00:46:04,507 --> 00:46:05,804
The motherf!@$%

553
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:08,469
Get out of these shelling area

554
00:46:11,013 --> 00:46:13,038
There's shelling
on the National Highway, sir!

555
00:46:17,553 --> 00:46:19,020
Motherf!@$%...

556
00:46:19,855 --> 00:46:22,255
They're using heavy shelling
to welcome our forces!

557
00:46:22,525 --> 00:46:26,222
Yadav, we had information
that they and some Mujah...

558
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:28,394
what do you call them...?
- Mujha... screw them!

559
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:29,824
The Mujahideen !

560
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:37,369
Looks like they want to wreck
the National Highway...

561
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:39,871
so they can isolate Ladakh and Kashmir
from the rest of the country!

562
00:46:41,577 --> 00:46:43,306
l was told some rats
had got in

563
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,875
ls that the sound of the rats?

564
00:46:47,149 --> 00:46:50,141
Balwan, maybe these rats
are going to bother us

565
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:57,854
Bombshells... bombshells
One after the other!

566
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:09,804
Glory to Krishna!

567
00:47:10,473 --> 00:47:13,499
Glory to Mother lndia!

568
00:50:47,623 --> 00:50:51,059
Sir, neither has anyone seen the enemy,
nor heard them

569
00:50:51,627 --> 00:50:54,187
Who they are and in what numbers,
no one knows

570
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,522
All we see is a hail of bullets...

571
00:50:56,965 --> 00:50:58,956
and hear the cries of
those who are dying

572
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:01,501
The injured soldier must've
told you something?

573
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:05,306
They don't even know whether the
ones up there are human or beasts...

574
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:07,235
dogs or wolves!

575
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:11,039
Dogs and wolves don't use
rocket-launchers and rifles, Anuj

576
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:15,244
These men must be the crazy jihadis
you have seen in the valley

577
00:51:17,553 --> 00:51:19,987
The sort of firepower they are using
clearly suggests...

578
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:22,314
that the Pakistani forces
are giving them full support

579
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:24,524
This is a serious situation

580
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:29,454
Those firing from up there could be
just 4 in number or even four thousand

581
00:51:29,932 --> 00:51:34,869
We are being thrust into a wreck
we know nothing about

582
00:51:35,904 --> 00:51:37,531
When one is groping
in the darkness...

583
00:51:37,906 --> 00:51:40,568
if not a torch, one must
at least have a candle, sir

584
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:44,534
Sharmaji, if you are so fond of asking
questions, why did you join the army?

585
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:49,447
You ought to have gone to Parliament
or another government assembly

586
00:51:49,918 --> 00:51:51,476
l'm sorry, sir.
- lt's okay

587
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:54,885
Get the Bravo company ready,
for reiki

588
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:57,891
To understand the enemy, we must
learn the terrain

589
00:51:58,127 --> 00:51:59,560
l need Anuj with me, sir

590
00:51:59,928 --> 00:52:03,159
Sure, but after three days
of acclimatisation

591
00:52:04,533 --> 00:52:07,502
Now if anyone of you have
any questions or doubts...

592
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,438
ask me right now.
After this no questions

593
00:52:10,873 --> 00:52:12,170
Understand?
- Yes, sir

594
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:16,402
Sir, we will make contact with
the enemy in three days

595
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:19,439
We'll identify the enemy.
l promise you

596
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:20,849
Good luck

597
00:52:43,939 --> 00:52:45,099
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings

598
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:49,400
Sir, my truck has run off the road.
l need help to get it out, sir

599
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,201
Let's go and see

600
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:55,174
C'mon boys, let's move

601
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,509
Which battalion are they from?

602
00:53:21,877 --> 00:53:24,437
They're the dead bodies of
officers and soldiers...

603
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,440
from the Sikh Regiment
and the Grenadiers

604
00:53:27,883 --> 00:53:29,851
We're taking them to Delhi
from Srinagar

605
00:53:35,891 --> 00:53:38,860
Bodies. Truckloads of them

606
00:53:40,195 --> 00:53:42,254
l swear it on the milk
my mother fed me...

607
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:44,866
l will avenge every death !

608
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:51,872
Right now l'm not thinking of revenge.
l'm thinking of their families...

609
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:55,168
in whose courtyard the bodies
of these martyrs will be laid

610
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:58,309
Looks like there's a lot of trouble
brewing in the Kargil sector, sir

611
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:00,206
Let's put the coffins inside

612
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:42,988
Our information said it was
about a hundred mujahideen

613
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:45,149
lt was wrong

614
00:54:45,627 --> 00:54:49,461
The enemy strength is estimated to be
between 2000 to 3000 troops...

615
00:54:49,898 --> 00:54:53,425
which has taken control right from
the Muskoh valley to the Batalik sector

616
00:54:53,936 --> 00:54:58,373
Supported by Pakistan's fifth
Northern Light lnfantry

617
00:55:07,115 --> 00:55:09,140
Take some men to the right.
- Right away, sir

618
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,838
Sir, looks like all the villagers have
run away because of Pakistani shelling

619
00:55:51,526 --> 00:55:53,016
All clear, sir!

620
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,148
Relax.
Sit down, Manoj

621
00:56:18,086 --> 00:56:18,984
Come. Sit

622
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:24,525
Manoj, we have established control
over the village Yaldor

623
00:56:25,861 --> 00:56:27,829
Why don't we make this
our base-camp?

624
00:56:28,864 --> 00:56:30,525
Brigadier Devendra Singh
has issued orders...

625
00:56:30,999 --> 00:56:34,400
that a company of our Gurkha Regiment
will help the 3 Punjab Battalion...

626
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,338
and the 16 Grenadiers.
- Very well, sir

627
00:56:37,873 --> 00:56:40,398
They haven't been able to make any
headway towards Kukarthang

628
00:56:40,876 --> 00:56:42,969
Because of the enemy's
power of resistance

629
00:56:43,412 --> 00:56:46,848
Enemy at Kukarthang is very powerful.
A man in fire power

630
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:50,977
Who could be better than you to battle
the enemy, Wrestler Pandey...?

631
00:56:51,887 --> 00:56:55,345
l want you to take a company and
proceed towards Kukarthang

632
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:56,955
Very well, sir.
- ls that okay?

633
00:56:57,159 --> 00:56:59,024
lt will be done

634
00:56:59,895 --> 00:57:03,228
But l have a request.
Even if don't get any rations...

635
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:05,796
there should be no lack
of ammunitions, sir

636
00:57:06,334 --> 00:57:07,961
l'll make sure of that

637
00:57:08,437 --> 00:57:10,905
l want you to be fully prepared.
- Very well, sir

638
00:57:11,173 --> 00:57:14,040
l will take a company and
proceed towards Jubaar

639
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:17,809
Tomorrow we'll move
at six hundred hours

640
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,508
Six hundred hours,
it will be, sir

641
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:36,564
Relax

642
00:57:37,566 --> 00:57:41,093
l've asked you to relax
although l know...

643
00:57:41,403 --> 00:57:44,304
that any relaxation for us in the coming
days is going to be extremely sinful

644
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:49,873
We have been entrusted a mission that
won't bring relaxation anywhere near us

645
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:54,072
Our target will be the Kukarthang Post

646
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,244
Soldiers of the 3 Punjab
and the 16 Grenadiers...

647
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,180
have been trying to capture the post
at Kukarthang for the past few days

648
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:05,485
But such is the fire and confidence
of the enemy...

649
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:08,792
that our soldiers haven't been able
to move further at all

650
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:11,327
We've got to rush to their help

651
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:14,802
l know it's not an easy job

652
00:58:15,637 --> 00:58:19,403
But looking at the confidence, bravery
and history of the Gurkha regiment...

653
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:22,241
it doesn't seem difficult either.
Any doubts?

654
00:58:22,544 --> 00:58:23,511
None, sir

655
00:58:24,846 --> 00:58:29,044
We will carry enough ammunition,
but do also carry a lot of stretchers

656
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:33,148
Which means some of us
are not going to return, sir

657
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:38,390
Each and every one of us will return.
ln whatever state he is

658
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:44,430
That's Manoj Pandey's promise to you.
We will not leave behind a single friend

659
00:58:44,866 --> 00:58:46,458
Any doubts?
- None, sir

660
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:49,469
Some lives will still be lost, sir

661
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:52,165
Yes, surely

662
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,774
Maybe you don't know.
Death is a bride...

663
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:05,382
that picks and chooses
the most handsome of grooms

664
00:59:05,854 --> 00:59:09,790
Then l don't stand any chance, sir.
l'm not handsome at all!

665
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:12,325
That's what you think, Thapa

666
00:59:12,627 --> 00:59:16,119
You must ask your mother
how good-looking you are

667
00:59:37,085 --> 00:59:39,519
Sir, we've established contact
with 3 Punjab!

668
00:59:40,021 --> 00:59:41,818
How far away are they?
- They appear to be close by, sir

669
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:44,819
Take positions! The enemy could
be trying to deceive us

670
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,467
Ask for the link-up code

671
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:56,529
Bravo one for Alfa one

672
00:59:57,572 --> 00:59:59,403
Link of Gomti. Over

673
00:59:59,874 --> 01:00:02,502
Bravo, this is Alfa.
ln Gomti's care... over

674
01:00:03,044 --> 01:00:05,274
ls he saying in Gomti's care
or is it Gomti's banks...?

675
01:00:05,614 --> 01:00:07,548
He said, ''care'', sir.
- All right

676
01:00:08,049 --> 01:00:10,517
Give them our position and
summon them for a link-up

677
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:15,454
Bravo one for Alfa one.
Get difference. 43126... over

678
01:00:16,891 --> 01:00:18,415
We can see them, sir

679
01:00:54,629 --> 01:00:55,596
All clear

680
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:20,144
Everybody sit down in single file

681
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,949
What news?
- Bad news, sir

682
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,255
A patrol party of 3 Punjab
and 16 Grenadiers...

683
01:01:27,562 --> 01:01:29,928
went towards Kukarthang.
And they never returned

684
01:01:30,165 --> 01:01:31,860
We've been here for the
last 20 days, sir

685
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,864
Didn't you go in search
of your companions?

686
01:01:34,202 --> 01:01:35,601
No, sir.
We had orders...

687
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,444
not to leave our post,
so that more lives would not be lost

688
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:41,261
We gained control of this position
with great difficulty

689
01:01:41,632 --> 01:01:43,532
The brigade doesn't want the enemy
to take control of this position...

690
01:01:43,968 --> 01:01:47,165
which will take them further.
- All right

691
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:49,529
The Gurkhas are here
to relieve you

692
01:01:49,974 --> 01:01:52,340
We'll take this route up there.
- Not this route, sir

693
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:55,611
This is the route our patrolling party
took and they haven't come back

694
01:01:56,981 --> 01:01:58,949
This is the route l will take

695
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:06,054
Hello Simran, listen...
Oh ! Sorry aunty

696
01:02:06,524 --> 01:02:08,219
Will you give the phone
to Simran please?

697
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:13,192
Simran ! Oh, l'm glad
to hear your voice

698
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:16,324
That's the crazy lover

699
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:19,299
What luck, darling!

700
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:22,231
We found a telephone booth at the
foothill of the snow-capped mountains!

701
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,304
And wonder of wonders.
l found you at home too!

702
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,912
Why? Does she always
go wandering around...?

703
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,515
We're engaged. We'll now be married.
And then...?

704
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,452
Speak up! What's there
to be shy about?

705
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:39,984
l'll tell you

706
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:42,318
The marriage will take
place in Tololing

707
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:44,618
And the honeymoon's
happening in Tiger Hills

708
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:47,097
Fantastic, Jimmy.
Keep it up

709
01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:49,027
lt's really very cold, Simran

710
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,997
But the warmth of your love
helps me battle the chill

711
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:58,533
Wow! ls that a new
brand of heater?

712
01:03:03,414 --> 01:03:04,381
Excuse me

713
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:07,173
Do you know me?

714
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:12,412
Not really, but having heard you
speak on the telephone...

715
01:03:12,723 --> 01:03:15,556
l've got to know a bit about you.
- And having heard your rubbish...

716
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:18,187
l've got to know how
insolent you are

717
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,357
What...?
- Yes

718
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:24,031
Hey Guys! Relax

719
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,494
Captain Sanjiv Jamwal,
13 Jak Rif

720
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:28,938
Captain Anuj Nayyar.
17 Jat

721
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,573
This is Lieutenant Batra. My friend

722
01:03:32,109 --> 01:03:35,545
Fun and jokes were born with him...
and maybe they'll leave with him

723
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,413
Don't mind him

724
01:03:37,748 --> 01:03:42,310
Mr Batra, jokes are all right as long as
they don't hurt someone's feelings

725
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:48,252
lf l have hurt your feelings,
l apologise

726
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:49,926
Very sorry

727
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:52,552
That's like it.
- And by the way, it's Vicky

728
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:53,997
Anuj

729
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:57,193
Anuj. Where are you from?
- Delhi

730
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,162
And you?
- Palanpur

731
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,437
Beautiful place.
- Beautiful women

732
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:08,077
C'mon Yogendra... join the queue

733
01:04:09,914 --> 01:04:11,882
Oh yes, you're newly married

734
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,518
At least have a word
with the poor girl

735
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,512
Tell me something... is it enough
that you just talk to her?

736
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:22,482
That only a married man
would be able to tell, sir

737
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:25,086
And you aren't even married yet

738
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:29,991
All l know is that my folks are waiting
for Balwan to visit them on vacation...

739
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:32,496
so that they can
handcuff him in marriage!

740
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:35,235
ln which case, the two of us are
sailing in the same boat, sir

741
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:37,440
You...?
- Excuse me, sir

742
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:39,538
l'm Sanjay Kumar from
the J & K Rifles

743
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,912
l couldn't resist myself
when l overheard your conversation

744
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:45,174
Balwan

745
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:47,048
Yogendra, 18 Grenadiers

746
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:48,308
Hello.
- Hello

747
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:52,586
The pining for that first union
with the beloved after marriage...

748
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,287
is unique in itself

749
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:59,322
''l must leave to unite
with my beloved''

750
01:04:59,964 --> 01:05:02,524
He's turned a poet!
- Get married, sir

751
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,093
The worst of illiterates
turn poets

752
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:44,199
Praised be Krishna.
- Praised be Krishna, sir

753
01:05:44,575 --> 01:05:46,543
What are you eating?
- Bread, sir

754
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:50,577
ls everything okay, Yogendra?
- Okay, sir

755
01:05:52,683 --> 01:05:54,651
My Bengali friend...
- Yes?

756
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:59,389
Glory to Subhash Chandra Bose!
- How are you, Balwan?

757
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,453
Great. Very well!
- Good, good, good

758
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:03,893
What are you eating?
- Bread

759
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,197
Hey Sachin...
- What?

760
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,369
Glory to Shivaji Maharaj!
- Glory to him!

761
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:22,009
You've eaten...?
- Am eating... want some? C'mon

762
01:06:27,618 --> 01:06:30,587
What are you doing, you clown !
- Clown...?

763
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:34,489
l took some bread from Bengal,
some from Maharashtra...

764
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:36,586
won't l take any from U.P. ?

765
01:06:37,628 --> 01:06:39,493
Hasn't Balwan brought
anything to eat?

766
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:43,456
l have, sir... loads of it

767
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:46,002
But not to be eaten. To be fed

768
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:49,105
To be fed?
- Yes

769
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:52,570
l've brought bullets, sir.
l'll feed the Pakistanis

770
01:06:53,544 --> 01:06:56,240
Don't tell me. You mean, you haven't
brought any food?

771
01:06:57,748 --> 01:06:59,613
l carried a lot of slugs, sir

772
01:07:00,484 --> 01:07:03,453
The Pakistanis are starving
for the bullets nowadays

773
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:06,318
Bravo! Well said

774
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,552
There was artillery firing here

775
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:45,554
Looks like this is where
the action took place

776
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:49,592
Watch out... there could be landmines!
- Watch out... for landmines

777
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,405
He's still clutching the rifle, sir

778
01:08:35,913 --> 01:08:37,881
Even if life has deserted him...

779
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,975
the soldier still has his gun

780
01:08:46,924 --> 01:08:51,190
He's been dead for many days.
He belonged to the 16 Grenadiers, sir

781
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:55,490
Which means the rest of the missing
patrol party must be somewhere around

782
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,448
To begin with, make arrangements
to take the bodies down

783
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:15,147
Get the stretcher...
Move quickly

784
01:10:24,955 --> 01:10:27,617
Take cover! Take up positions!

785
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:44,063
l've been hit by a bullet, sir!
- Nothing will happen to you !

786
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:46,272
l've been hit, sir!
- You will be all right, Thapa!

787
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:14,563
We've contacted the company
behind us, sir!

788
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,906
Tell them that we need
immediate reinforcement!

789
01:11:17,207 --> 01:11:19,607
Till then, we'll hold on to
our positions. Any doubt?

790
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:03,175
Hey dead-meat... you're here
to pick up the bodies...?

791
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,078
Go ahead, take them away.
You can roast them in fire!

792
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,591
You sisterf& ^%$% sonofabitch !

793
01:12:10,093 --> 01:12:11,560
You love playing with fire,
don't you?

794
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:14,055
You're the one l'm going to roast
in the fires, you rotten motherf$#@ !

795
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,217
Stop firing!

796
01:12:35,152 --> 01:12:38,519
lt's going to be dark soon.
Take cover behind the rocks

797
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:41,321
No one will open fire... Any doubts?
- No, sir!

798
01:13:07,918 --> 01:13:09,977
Why've you stopped firing,
you dog?

799
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,900
Sir, our reinforcement has reached

800
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:41,509
Move as soon as the clouds
cover the moon

801
01:13:41,952 --> 01:13:43,920
Lie still when the moon shows up

802
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:46,322
The enemy mustn't get to know
about our movement

803
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:29,398
Fire an illumination round

804
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:35,928
Shoot the dogs!

805
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:37,606
ET 456 fire

806
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:06,231
Praise be to Goddess Kali!

807
01:15:06,603 --> 01:15:09,071
Here comes the Gurkha!

808
01:15:55,352 --> 01:15:57,320
There could be mines ahead, sir!

809
01:15:57,587 --> 01:15:59,578
Move on, in the name
of the Goddess Kali

810
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:03,448
Praise to Goddess Kali!
- Here comes the Gurkha!

811
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:27,344
Come on, swines!

812
01:16:34,524 --> 01:16:36,458
Bheem Bahadur, take them on
from the left

813
01:17:51,968 --> 01:17:54,562
Hail Goddess Kali!

814
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:57,936
Here comes the Gurkha!

815
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:14,252
Alfa to Gomti's care... over.
- Wait

816
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,552
The C.O.'s on the line, sir

817
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:20,454
Gomti's care to Alfa... over.
- Congratulations, Manoj

818
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:23,388
This is a great day. First victory
of operation Vijay. Over

819
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,464
Thank you, sir. Over.
- What's the matter, Manoj?

820
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:29,335
You don't seem to be happy. Over

821
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:31,368
lt's a great day for you, sir

822
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:35,173
But for me, it'll always be a day
when l lost my men

823
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,180
Today l lost nine
of my Gurkha brothers

824
01:18:38,615 --> 01:18:40,879
And right now l'm sending
their corpses to their families

825
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:43,886
l hope you will understand
what l'm going through, sir

826
01:18:44,621 --> 01:18:47,112
l was responsible for those soldiers

827
01:18:47,624 --> 01:18:53,221
Manoj, when a soldier goes to war
he leaves his sentiments behind

828
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:54,897
Over

829
01:18:55,632 --> 01:18:57,293
You are right, sir.
- Over and out

830
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:18,115
However, these bloody sentiments
sneak in, and break the heart

831
01:19:44,581 --> 01:19:45,548
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind

832
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:05,230
Take your seats

833
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:09,232
Let me brief you gentlemen

834
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,301
Our primary aim...

835
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:16,408
is to capture point 4540

836
01:20:17,447 --> 01:20:19,438
That will cut off all the roads
to Muskoh valley...

837
01:20:19,682 --> 01:20:22,116
through which the
Pakistani infiltrators receive help

838
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:25,519
Our final objective, point 4875

839
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:30,150
This point is as important
as Tiger hill

840
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,191
That's the point from where we can
keep an eye on the entire Dras sector

841
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:36,429
Besides, to protect
our National Highway...

842
01:20:36,733 --> 01:20:38,928
it is imperative that
we hold this point

843
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:40,636
Major Puniya.
- Yes, sir

844
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,235
You will attack point 4540
with the B company

845
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:46,642
Charlie Company
will remain in reserve

846
01:20:46,976 --> 01:20:50,673
Major Deepak Rampal,
you three JCOs, seven jawans...

847
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:52,613
and Captain Anuj Nayyar...

848
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:56,209
and the two of you...
You will survey the heights...

849
01:20:56,786 --> 01:20:59,550
between 5930 to 4830

850
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:05,457
Deepak, you always said that our job
is to hunt and destroy the enemy

851
01:21:05,929 --> 01:21:07,590
To seek and destroy.
- Yes, sir

852
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,656
Well, this is your chance

853
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:12,101
Brigadier Kakad
has given us the go-ahead

854
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:16,368
Anuj, you wanted to
know the enemy, right?

855
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:19,905
Go on, introduce yourself

856
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:22,373
lntroduce the lndian Army to them

857
01:21:23,947 --> 01:21:25,141
Good luck, boys

858
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:29,240
Anuj, you are trapped, sonny

859
01:21:29,686 --> 01:21:32,086
You will be surrounded by Jhangus
all your life

860
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:34,513
My sister-in-law is
your to-be wife's best friend

861
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:36,585
And my brother is your batchmate

862
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,326
What will you do now?
- Who knows, sir...

863
01:21:39,629 --> 01:21:42,598
whether the Jhangus will be
known as Nayyars or vice versa?

864
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:47,368
But the best part is,
when friends turn relatives...

865
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:50,161
it makes the journey of life
even more beautiful

866
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:52,234
You're dead right

867
01:21:52,675 --> 01:21:54,939
Too wise for your age

868
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,577
But Anuj, be careful

869
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:00,276
Hope these Jhangus don't make you
live with them

870
01:22:00,617 --> 01:22:04,144
Sir, for the sake of her love,
l'm willing to do that too

871
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,204
Take cover. Move

872
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:25,458
See something?

873
01:23:25,935 --> 01:23:28,369
The enemy's mortar position, sir

874
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:32,505
How many men?
- As many as they need

875
01:23:33,943 --> 01:23:36,343
May l say something?
- Yes

876
01:23:36,646 --> 01:23:41,606
Looking at that Pakistani piss...
l too feel like doing it

877
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:45,347
Which means they will have to die
a little earlier for your sake?

878
01:23:45,655 --> 01:23:46,622
Yeah !

879
01:23:46,956 --> 01:23:49,925
When you got to go,
you got to go

880
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,387
Let's go then.
Let's go

881
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:01,870
Bloody...!

882
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:50,618
Bring first aid

883
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:18,514
Anuj

884
01:25:27,390 --> 01:25:28,880
Alfa come in

885
01:25:29,192 --> 01:25:31,524
Bravo this is Alfa.
Pass your message. Over

886
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:35,290
Sir, we captured
the mortar position

887
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:38,295
But unfortunately
we've lost two men, sir

888
01:25:39,035 --> 01:25:42,493
Some wounded and some dead, sir
- Goddamit!

889
01:25:43,573 --> 01:25:45,404
Anyway, you consolidate
your positions

890
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,371
Hang on in there.
And don't worry

891
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:52,603
l'll sending you reinforcement
to bring back the wounded and the dead

892
01:25:53,115 --> 01:25:54,639
Over.
- Yes, sir

893
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:57,915
We'll check the position, sir
- Come back soon, Deepak

894
01:25:58,221 --> 01:25:59,916
l'll be waiting for you. Over

895
01:26:01,591 --> 01:26:03,456
Over and out.
- Over and out, sir

896
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:18,163
Everybody alert.
Looks like someone is coming

897
01:26:18,908 --> 01:26:20,273
Could be the enemy

898
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:22,070
Take position

899
01:26:45,935 --> 01:26:49,029
Our men. lt seems they are
bringing in casualties

900
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:53,465
Yadav-ji...
- Yes?

901
01:26:53,943 --> 01:26:55,911
Our friends are in bad shape

902
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:11,856
Oh my God!

903
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:17,024
Nursing assistant

904
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,458
Give morphine shots to all of them

905
01:27:20,036 --> 01:27:24,302
The enemy can't be seen.
We can't assess their strength either

906
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:27,474
lf they can shoot a soldier
in the eye...

907
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:30,310
imagine the advantageous position
they are in

908
01:27:30,613 --> 01:27:32,012
What is this?

909
01:27:32,949 --> 01:27:35,144
Can't see the enemy!
Don't know their position?

910
01:27:36,986 --> 01:27:37,975
Madness!

911
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:42,322
How far is your platoon?
- Six kilometres away from here, sir

912
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:44,616
Okay. Let's go.
- Yes, sir

913
01:27:52,034 --> 01:27:53,592
Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind

914
01:27:54,637 --> 01:27:56,332
What is the position, Balwan?

915
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,607
Sir, 16 Grenadiers
are in real bad shape

916
01:28:00,543 --> 01:28:06,038
Heavy artillery shelling.
The casualties informed us

917
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,245
Casualties...? Many?

918
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:12,517
Yes, sir... too many

919
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:15,318
There's no artillery support

920
01:28:36,612 --> 01:28:39,445
l believe the situation is very bad.
- Yes, sir. lt's very serious

921
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:41,314
Let's go inside.
- Come in, sir

922
01:28:41,617 --> 01:28:43,585
Let's prepare
for the Tololing attack, sir

923
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:47,589
Sir, you've got mail

924
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:56,325
Sir, it's from Ms Kiran.
Read it

925
01:28:56,632 --> 01:28:58,293
Later, Hari Singh

926
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:00,535
l know what's written

927
01:29:01,037 --> 01:29:04,473
She must've written, our first
wedding anniversary is approaching

928
01:29:05,374 --> 01:29:07,842
Must've enquired if l'm going home
for the wedding anniversary

929
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:13,070
You tell me, Hari Singh,
what do l reply?

930
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:16,850
MMG means...

931
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:19,850
Mandir, Mosque and Gurdwara

932
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:32,999
Glory to the righteous!

933
01:29:33,269 --> 01:29:34,463
May evil be vanquished!

934
01:29:34,904 --> 01:29:36,337
May there be compassion

935
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:37,867
May the world have peace

936
01:29:38,074 --> 01:29:40,406
Long live 18 Grenadiers!

937
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:25,248
No one moves

938
01:30:42,138 --> 01:30:44,333
Sachin, can't see anything

939
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,367
Besides, there's a heavy fog.
What d'you say?

940
01:30:47,743 --> 01:30:49,643
Yes sir, it's too foggy

941
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,377
Yogendra Singh Yadav, what do you say?

942
01:30:53,682 --> 01:30:56,378
Should we go ahead? Or should we
wait for the fog to clear?

943
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,950
Anything you think best, sir.
- We'll slowly move ahead, sir

944
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:05,121
No, Balwan. We can neither
spot the enemy nor his post

945
01:31:05,528 --> 01:31:08,361
And there's this fog!
l think we should stay back

946
01:31:11,934 --> 01:31:14,164
Sachin, order the company
to be at ease

947
01:31:14,937 --> 01:31:16,564
Company! At ease

948
01:31:49,822 --> 01:31:51,187
Company...

949
01:31:52,024 --> 01:31:54,185
everybody alert!

950
01:31:55,127 --> 01:31:57,186
Take your positions!

951
01:32:13,145 --> 01:32:15,045
Everybody! Take positions!

952
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:20,819
Sachin, l can't see those bastards.
- l don't see them either

953
01:32:30,863 --> 01:32:32,831
Show up, sisterf''*$@!

954
01:32:36,869 --> 01:32:38,063
Motherf!@''$! Come out!

955
01:32:38,204 --> 01:32:40,172
Motherf!@''$!
- Kill the sisterf!@''$!

956
01:32:41,107 --> 01:32:43,098
Show up, motherf!@''$

957
01:32:43,809 --> 01:32:45,003
Take aim

958
01:32:45,111 --> 01:32:47,443
lf you are man enough, show up!

959
01:32:47,947 --> 01:32:50,177
Motherf!@''$

960
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:56,185
Shall l move up, Yadav-ji?
- Stay there

961
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:58,187
Come out you bastard

962
01:33:02,962 --> 01:33:04,793
l still can't see those bastards

963
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:08,197
l'll have to go further up.
- l'm coming, sir

964
01:33:08,935 --> 01:33:10,800
Give me cover fire.
- Yes, sir

965
01:33:11,003 --> 01:33:12,800
Give Balwan saheb cover fire!

966
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:18,207
l'm going in.
Give me covering fire

967
01:33:19,478 --> 01:33:23,812
Yadav-ji, can't see those motherf!@$%.
- The motherf!@$% are hiding

968
01:33:29,855 --> 01:33:32,824
Get the stretcher!
Take the casualties down

969
01:33:33,259 --> 01:33:36,160
We'll need eight to ten men
to carry the casualties down

970
01:33:36,796 --> 01:33:38,764
We'll lose our strength !
Understand?

971
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:41,962
Eight men, go down. Eight men !
Go!

972
01:33:43,803 --> 01:33:44,770
Bastards!

973
01:33:47,807 --> 01:33:49,775
Bravo for Alfa

974
01:33:50,109 --> 01:33:51,337
Come in Alfa

975
01:33:51,978 --> 01:33:54,446
This is Bravo.
- Alfa come in

976
01:33:55,815 --> 01:33:59,182
Get me the C.O immediately.
l want to talk to the C.O

977
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:15,792
This is Bravo.
We need artillery support, sir

978
01:34:15,968 --> 01:34:17,265
l'm sorry. Fall back

979
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:23,599
No, sir. l'm in enemy quarters, sir.
l cannot lose ground, sir!

980
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:26,208
lt is an order.
Come back, Rajesh !

981
01:34:26,979 --> 01:34:30,210
Sorry, sir.
l cannot do that, sir

982
01:34:30,383 --> 01:34:33,216
Rajesh, fall back.
- lf we retract now...

983
01:34:33,386 --> 01:34:35,820
we'll lose more lives in trying
to recapture this land later, sir

984
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:37,752
Okay.
- Over

985
01:34:38,424 --> 01:34:42,758
We'll take our casualties
down before sunrise

986
01:34:43,195 --> 01:34:45,755
We'll regroup them and
get them tomorrow night, sir

987
01:34:45,965 --> 01:34:49,162
l totally agree with you.
l don't want to lose any more lives

988
01:34:49,969 --> 01:34:53,166
Company take cover.
lt's an order

989
01:34:53,339 --> 01:34:54,772
Take cover

990
01:34:55,441 --> 01:34:58,171
Sachin, l'm going
towards the Barbad bunker

991
01:34:58,811 --> 01:35:00,779
Now you take command..
Come along

992
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:02,311
Give me cover fire

993
01:35:19,398 --> 01:35:21,195
To Mother lndia...

994
01:35:24,103 --> 01:35:26,196
glory be!

995
01:36:19,925 --> 01:36:20,892
Boys...

996
01:36:22,828 --> 01:36:25,194
before coming to Kargil,
the C.O told us...

997
01:36:26,232 --> 01:36:29,201
that our platoon's slogan is
Victory or Martyrdom!

998
01:36:30,236 --> 01:36:34,798
The time has come
to crush the enemy

999
01:36:36,442 --> 01:36:38,740
The time has come,
to avenge our dead comrades...

1000
01:36:38,878 --> 01:36:41,745
to avenge our wounded compatriots
in the hills

1001
01:36:42,181 --> 01:36:43,739
Any doubts?
- No, sir

1002
01:36:43,883 --> 01:36:45,748
Hail Almighty Lord

1003
01:36:46,785 --> 01:36:50,744
Whoever wants to
write to his family...

1004
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:53,317
may write and hand over
the letter to the C.O

1005
01:36:53,792 --> 01:36:55,760
You have half an hour

1006
01:37:02,468 --> 01:37:03,765
Speak to your wife

1007
01:37:04,203 --> 01:37:06,763
lf you consent,
the soldiers first...?

1008
01:37:09,341 --> 01:37:11,775
Who wants to talk to his folks
over the satellite phone? Come on

1009
01:37:13,812 --> 01:37:15,780
Here... call home, go on

1010
01:37:19,818 --> 01:37:24,778
lf l fail to return, you will give
my daughter's hand away in marriage, sir

1011
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:28,118
Shut up, rascal.
You will perform the ritual yourself

1012
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:29,921
lt's the same thing, sir

1013
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:33,562
All l regret is that l couldn't
talk to my wife and children

1014
01:37:33,832 --> 01:37:36,130
Talk to your wife
when you come back victorious

1015
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:47,746
Cover me

1016
01:37:53,786 --> 01:37:54,753
Come on

1017
01:38:09,935 --> 01:38:12,768
Sachin, what is the position?

1018
01:38:13,038 --> 01:38:14,767
Sir, Adhikari is over

1019
01:38:15,808 --> 01:38:17,776
Oh shit! l knew it

1020
01:38:17,943 --> 01:38:21,174
Many of us are wounded, sir
Several dead, sir

1021
01:38:21,313 --> 01:38:22,780
How far away is Balwan?

1022
01:38:22,982 --> 01:38:24,779
He's 6 to 12 ft away from
Adhikari's body, sir

1023
01:38:25,818 --> 01:38:27,183
And he's trying to bring him down, sir

1024
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:30,789
All right, l want to go close to
Adhikari's body. Give me cover fire

1025
01:38:30,956 --> 01:38:32,787
lt's too dangerous for you, sir

1026
01:38:33,225 --> 01:38:35,785
Look Sachin, it's as dangerous for me
as it is for you

1027
01:38:37,763 --> 01:38:41,130
Just relax.
Just give me cover fire, okay?

1028
01:38:42,434 --> 01:38:44,026
Come on, move

1029
01:38:44,770 --> 01:38:46,738
Give Vishwanathan covering fire

1030
01:38:51,777 --> 01:38:55,144
Where's Rajesh Adhikari's body?

1031
01:38:55,881 --> 01:38:58,748
A little up ahead...
near his wireless operator, sir

1032
01:38:58,951 --> 01:39:02,751
We'll have to retrieve his body.
- Negative, sir

1033
01:39:02,921 --> 01:39:06,755
l tried to go there twice, sir.
There's heavy firing from the other side

1034
01:39:07,793 --> 01:39:09,158
Bastards!

1035
01:39:10,796 --> 01:39:11,956
l don't care, Balwan

1036
01:39:12,798 --> 01:39:14,766
Ranbhir Singh, give me cover.
- Yes sir

1037
01:39:14,967 --> 01:39:17,765
l want to go to him
- No, sir! Just stay there

1038
01:39:20,306 --> 01:39:21,273
Stop, sir

1039
01:39:35,487 --> 01:39:36,715
Oh shit!

1040
01:39:38,924 --> 01:39:41,358
Balwan, l think l'm hit

1041
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,729
l'm... Oh mother... mother...

1042
01:39:52,771 --> 01:39:54,136
Where are you hit?

1043
01:39:58,777 --> 01:40:01,143
Get the stretcher!
Take him down

1044
01:40:01,313 --> 01:40:04,749
No! lt'll require seven-eight men
to take me down

1045
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:07,750
lt'll weaken our battallion's strength.
Listen to me

1046
01:40:08,787 --> 01:40:12,746
You get those bastards.
This is the order

1047
01:40:14,793 --> 01:40:16,454
Alfa come in

1048
01:40:17,196 --> 01:40:20,757
This is Alfa. Pass your message.
- Vishwanathan sir is hit!

1049
01:40:20,933 --> 01:40:24,767
Vishwanathan sir is hit!
- Nothing's happened to me, sir

1050
01:40:24,937 --> 01:40:26,336
We just want that Tololing, sir

1051
01:40:42,154 --> 01:40:43,121
Vishu !

1052
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,126
What happened, Vishu?
- Why did you come up, sir?

1053
01:40:50,295 --> 01:40:52,729
You shouldn't have taken chances, sir

1054
01:40:52,865 --> 01:40:55,732
Vishu, are you alright?
- Sir, l'm fine

1055
01:40:55,901 --> 01:40:58,131
Bring the stretcher!
- No sir

1056
01:40:59,171 --> 01:41:02,732
Eight men will be engaged, sir.
lt'll weaken our battallion's strength

1057
01:41:03,175 --> 01:41:05,735
Please let me talk to Jalaja

1058
01:41:06,779 --> 01:41:09,145
l want to talk to my wife.
- Okay

1059
01:41:12,785 --> 01:41:13,752
Thank you, sir

1060
01:41:16,789 --> 01:41:19,758
Hello... Jalaja?
- Yes, Jalaja here

1061
01:41:19,925 --> 01:41:22,758
Talk to Vishu, Jalaja.
- Yeah

1062
01:41:24,196 --> 01:41:26,756
Vishu, this is Jalaja here

1063
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,165
Talk to me, Vishu

1064
01:41:30,202 --> 01:41:33,171
Talk to me, Vishu. Hello

1065
01:41:51,824 --> 01:41:53,792
We need artillery support, sir

1066
01:41:56,829 --> 01:41:59,798
Colonel Thakur, hold your position
and don't move forward

1067
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:02,801
l don't want anymore casualties

1068
01:42:03,469 --> 01:42:05,198
l'm sending you reinforcement

1069
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:08,396
2 Rajputana Rifles will be
there shortly. Right?

1070
01:42:08,841 --> 01:42:11,139
Thank you, sir.
- Over and out

1071
01:42:11,243 --> 01:42:12,210
Over and out

1072
01:42:14,847 --> 01:42:16,212
Sachin.
- Sir?

1073
01:42:17,249 --> 01:42:19,809
2 Raj Rif is here as reinforcement

1074
01:42:20,853 --> 01:42:23,219
Command is also giving us
artillery support

1075
01:42:24,423 --> 01:42:26,323
We have lost Vishu and Rajesh

1076
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:29,828
No more casualties.
- Yes, sir

1077
01:42:30,028 --> 01:42:31,825
Hold on to your position.
- Okay, sir

1078
01:42:32,965 --> 01:42:35,229
No one will fire,
no one will move...

1079
01:42:35,868 --> 01:42:37,768
until reinforcement arrives

1080
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:41,770
And especially you, Balwan.
You dig?

1081
01:42:41,974 --> 01:42:44,169
Don't move at all. Okay?

1082
01:43:28,086 --> 01:43:31,817
So, the boys of 13 Jak Rif are here

1083
01:43:32,991 --> 01:43:34,151
At ease, gentlemen

1084
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:36,760
l was expecting you, Colonel

1085
01:43:37,195 --> 01:43:40,756
You need no introduction,
you are famous. lt shows

1086
01:43:40,966 --> 01:43:43,161
Besides, in the army
the word is that...

1087
01:43:43,335 --> 01:43:45,769
lf want to know, just ask Joe

1088
01:43:46,805 --> 01:43:49,171
lf you have a question,
ask Joshi

1089
01:43:49,808 --> 01:43:53,175
You are embarrassing me, sir

1090
01:43:53,812 --> 01:43:55,780
No Joe, no Joshi, sir

1091
01:43:55,914 --> 01:44:00,180
Only one name. Tololing.
- We know that, Colonel

1092
01:44:00,352 --> 01:44:03,788
National Highway Number One
is our lifeline, sir

1093
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:08,782
And to protect it, it is imperative
to kick the enemy out of Tololing

1094
01:44:09,227 --> 01:44:14,187
18 Grenadiers have made four attempts.
Unfortunately, they have failed.

1095
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,798
That's because, sir,
let give them their dues

1096
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:22,202
they barely had the time to acclimatise,
they had no artillery support

1097
01:44:22,841 --> 01:44:25,207
They had no idea
about the enemy's strength

1098
01:44:25,844 --> 01:44:27,812
They had no time for
rehearsals either, sir

1099
01:44:28,847 --> 01:44:32,806
But your battalion has had enough time
for acclimatisation, sir...

1100
01:44:34,853 --> 01:44:36,411
and has received artillery support too

1101
01:44:42,894 --> 01:44:44,418
l understand you, Colonel

1102
01:44:46,331 --> 01:44:48,765
But whether or not we receive
artillery support...

1103
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:52,165
whether or not we
find time for acclimatisation...

1104
01:44:52,337 --> 01:44:55,773
Rajputana Rifles will capture Tololing

1105
01:44:55,907 --> 01:44:57,772
And do you know why, Colonel

1106
01:44:58,810 --> 01:45:01,176
Because ''Defeat'' and ''Failure''
are words...

1107
01:45:01,346 --> 01:45:04,782
that are not in Raj Rif's history.
They're unknown

1108
01:45:05,317 --> 01:45:06,784
May it come true, sir

1109
01:45:06,985 --> 01:45:09,180
But in case you fail
in your endeavour...

1110
01:45:09,354 --> 01:45:12,187
13 Jak Rifles will have to do the job

1111
01:45:13,158 --> 01:45:16,525
l'm not saying it, sir. These are
the orders from headquarter

1112
01:45:16,928 --> 01:45:20,796
Don't worry, Colonel.
Victory and glory will be ours

1113
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:24,796
l'm sure.
One word, sir

1114
01:45:25,003 --> 01:45:26,470
Don't misunderstand me

1115
01:45:26,972 --> 01:45:30,806
There's a price to be
paid for success, sir

1116
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:34,809
Lives will be lost.
Try and keep the count low

1117
01:45:35,847 --> 01:45:38,748
Because, every son of our army,
who gives up his life...

1118
01:45:39,184 --> 01:45:42,745
takes with him
some moments of my life

1119
01:45:43,789 --> 01:45:45,757
You are a sentimental man, Colonel

1120
01:45:46,925 --> 01:45:48,756
That's me, sir. Joe

1121
01:45:51,196 --> 01:45:53,164
All the best, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir

1122
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:54,389
Move it boys

1123
01:46:00,806 --> 01:46:04,173
What's this? The C.O has put us
on acclimatisation practice

1124
01:46:04,509 --> 01:46:08,172
Why not Do or Die?
- Why talk about dying, sir?

1125
01:46:08,346 --> 01:46:11,179
Looks like your conversation
with Ms Rajshree over the phone...

1126
01:46:11,349 --> 01:46:12,782
wasn't a pleasant one

1127
01:46:13,218 --> 01:46:15,186
Yes, l had called her up

1128
01:46:16,221 --> 01:46:18,189
She hung up the moment she heard me

1129
01:46:19,224 --> 01:46:22,193
By now her trash bin
must be full of letters

1130
01:46:23,228 --> 01:46:27,187
Damn it! She takes pains
to heal the sick

1131
01:46:27,833 --> 01:46:31,792
But she can't feed my father.
She's not willing to quit the army

1132
01:46:33,105 --> 01:46:36,734
Enough, Devendra.
There's no stopping this divorce

1133
01:46:37,409 --> 01:46:43,143
No sir. l think you and Ms Rajshree
will make a fresh beginning

1134
01:46:45,784 --> 01:46:47,376
Hey Robin ! Bull's eye!

1135
01:46:47,786 --> 01:46:50,755
Sir, l'm ready for Tololing.
- Okay, come on. Let's go

1136
01:46:59,798 --> 01:47:02,767
Come. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir

1137
01:47:03,802 --> 01:47:05,770
Robin, how did you get the name Vijayant?

1138
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:11,170
My father was posted in Pathankot.
l was born there

1139
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:13,778
He was commanding
a brigade of Vijayant tanks

1140
01:47:14,813 --> 01:47:17,179
That's how l got the name Vijayant

1141
01:47:17,883 --> 01:47:21,182
Hey, don't mind me getting personal.
- Ofcourse not, Tau

1142
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:23,185
How did meet Sheetal?

1143
01:47:24,823 --> 01:47:26,791
Sheetal... Tau

1144
01:47:27,826 --> 01:47:31,421
l met her in Delhi
and fell in love with her

1145
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:35,197
Love at first sight, eh?
- Sort of

1146
01:47:35,534 --> 01:47:37,729
You want to marry her?
- Ofcourse

1147
01:47:38,069 --> 01:47:41,732
Have you spoken to her parents?
- Not yet

1148
01:47:42,174 --> 01:47:45,735
For my sake, Sheetal will first
win her parents over

1149
01:47:46,178 --> 01:47:50,137
And after she has made enough room,
she'll pull me in too

1150
01:47:50,782 --> 01:47:53,148
You are a rascal, Robin

1151
01:47:54,786 --> 01:47:59,155
Tau, when you call me Robin,
l feel like l'm at home...

1152
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:03,754
with my Ma.
- Did you see her before leaving?

1153
01:48:06,164 --> 01:48:07,756
l did and...

1154
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:09,767
almost didn't

1155
01:48:20,812 --> 01:48:23,178
Ma, where were you?
The train is about to leave

1156
01:48:23,448 --> 01:48:28,181
We went to buy your favourite sweets.
Laddoos and carrot-halwa

1157
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:30,788
Thanks mother.
Thank you very much

1158
01:48:30,956 --> 01:48:31,980
Thanks dad

1159
01:48:32,224 --> 01:48:34,454
Robin, make me proud.
- Yes dad, l will

1160
01:48:34,826 --> 01:48:36,293
God bless you
- Thank you dad

1161
01:48:36,761 --> 01:48:39,730
Son, take care of yourself.
- Don't worry about me, Ma

1162
01:48:39,898 --> 01:48:41,126
You take care of yourself

1163
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:45,133
The train's leaving.
- God bless you. Take care, Robin

1164
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:47,135
Bye, Robin

1165
01:48:51,910 --> 01:48:53,741
Bye.
- Bye mom. Bye dad

1166
01:49:00,418 --> 01:49:03,751
l wonder how long they waited there

1167
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:07,758
For a second, l thought...

1168
01:49:09,928 --> 01:49:11,759
l had left everything behind

1169
01:49:19,137 --> 01:49:20,764
Come on. Let's go

1170
01:49:21,806 --> 01:49:25,173
Hey, Robin. Don't get emotional.
lt's part of life, okay?

1171
01:49:25,977 --> 01:49:27,103
Okay, Tau

1172
01:49:31,483 --> 01:49:34,179
Tau, you grilled me...

1173
01:49:34,486 --> 01:49:35,919
but you haven't told me anything
about yourself

1174
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:39,847
Tell me, how did you meet your wife?
- Rascal

1175
01:49:40,225 --> 01:49:41,214
Tell me, please

1176
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:47,723
l was coming in a train
from Madras to Hyderabad

1177
01:49:47,966 --> 01:49:51,129
She was sitting opposite me.
l saw her;...

1178
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:55,137
she wasn't anything extraordinary.
Just like any other girl

1179
01:49:55,774 --> 01:49:58,743
She was knitting a sweater

1180
01:49:59,177 --> 01:50:03,136
She glanced at me once...

1181
01:50:03,315 --> 01:50:04,748
and that's it

1182
01:50:07,786 --> 01:50:11,745
That's it.
She is the one, my heart said

1183
01:50:12,090 --> 01:50:15,753
Wonderful! Amazing, Tau
Romance at it's best

1184
01:50:15,961 --> 01:50:22,161
Then?
- Then? We married within a year

1185
01:50:22,801 --> 01:50:25,167
And soon, we will have a baby

1186
01:50:25,804 --> 01:50:28,170
l know. She is pregnant

1187
01:50:28,807 --> 01:50:30,775
And every day you write to her
verses from the holy Geeta...

1188
01:50:30,976 --> 01:50:33,171
so that she reads it out to the baby
in her womb

1189
01:50:33,445 --> 01:50:36,243
But you haven't told me something.
- What?

1190
01:50:36,381 --> 01:50:40,715
The magic words.
How did you propose to her?

1191
01:50:42,754 --> 01:50:45,120

1192
01:50:46,157 --> 01:50:47,715

1194
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:50,185
Come, Colonel Ravindran

1195
01:51:51,456 --> 01:51:54,186
The situation is very bad

1196
01:51:57,829 --> 01:52:01,196
The troops at present are held
up at this position

1197
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:03,801
The enemy is somewhere here

1198
01:52:05,837 --> 01:52:07,464
Our army approached from here...

1199
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:12,799
and we have lost them.
Lots of casualties are there

1200
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:16,207
That leaves this one approach
which is very steep

1201
01:52:21,853 --> 01:52:23,821
l think we'll take this approach, sir

1202
01:52:24,089 --> 01:52:26,216
What do you say, Acharya?
- That's right, sir.

1203
01:52:26,357 --> 01:52:27,824
We have no other choice

1204
01:52:27,992 --> 01:52:31,223
You are lucky Ravindran.
