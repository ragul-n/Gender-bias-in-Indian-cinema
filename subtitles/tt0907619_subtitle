12
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,280

13
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:26,280
''Come, Iet's go.''

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,760
''Get on the
wing-horse and ruIe the sky.''

18
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,600

''Come, Iet's go.''

40
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,280
When there is a wiII,
there is a way even to mars.

41
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
And when there is wiII, we
feeI Iike we can do anything.

42
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,320
WaIking on the moon
isn't the onIy great thing.

43
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,560
Fighting against
injustice is aIso a great thing.

44
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Right now my
destination aIso a simiIar one.

45
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,360
KamaIa, keep the water

46
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,200
Yes, I am keeping it.
I woke up so earIy..

47
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,440
..but stiII I am getting Iate.
It's aIready 9 O' cIock.

48
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,640
Mother, have you fiIIed
the ink in my pen? - Yes.

49
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
KamaIa, is the Tiffin ready?
- Yes.

50
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,560
KamaIa, bring one more Dosa.
- Yes, I am coming.

51
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,800
Hey, move aside.
- You get aside.

52
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,680
Get aside.
- You get aside.

53
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,640
Are you going to
Tank Bunk or to coIIege?

54
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,640
You need to write exams weII,
but not rub power weII.

55
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
I am not Iike you, I have
aIready compIeted powder..

56
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,200
I mean I have aIready
revised the whoIe portion.

57
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,600
Wait for a moment, and then
hang this mirror in your neck.

58
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Get aside.
- That's what I am teIIing you.

59
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,800
Get aside.
- You get aside first.

60
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,680
What's there in your
face to see so Iong!

61
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,480
What isn't there in my face,
you teII me first?

62
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,640
The moustache.
- You are absoIuteIy right.

63
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,160
You demon !
- Mother.

64
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,680
You wiII faiI in aII the subjects.

65
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,560
It suits your face.
- You started it again?

66
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,160
Your head shouId be tonsured.
- Both of you didn't fight onIy..

67
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,200
..when you were my womb together.
But since you came..

68
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,240
..out I never saw you
without fighting even for a second.

69
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,480
Like parents Iike chiIdren.
- Father, Iook at him.

70
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
He doesn't know how to
respect eIders. - Who is eIder?

71
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,560
Just now mother confirmed it
that we both we born at once.

72
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,160
Yes, dear. We were
both simuItaneousIy..

73
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,440
..but who came out of
mother's womb first? It's me.

74
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,520
That means technicaIIy I am
eIder than you by ten minutes.

75
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
So you are my younger brother.

76
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,240
What's this, mother! You
couId have sent me out first.

77
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
Anyway, how can I expect
a Iady to support a boy!

78
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
That's why they say, Iadies first.
- Correct.

79
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,440
Father might have aIso said
the same thing whiIe deIivery.

80
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,120
Get Iost.
- And I Iet you go first.

81
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,160
Right. - But I am the taIIer
than you. So I am eIder than you.

82
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,200
Meenakshi, won't you worship
God. You are getting Iate.

83
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,560
God, with your grace I have writt
en aII the exams weII.

84
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,640

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
Gob, pIease grand me

87
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,720
O God.

88
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Father, come here.
- What?

89
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,360
''HaiI Lord Ganapati!''

90
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,240
Is Lord Ganapati drinking miIk?

91
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,120
Devotees, don't Ieave
everything up to me with..

92
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,400
..superstition and have some
faith in your wiII-power too.

93
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,240
It wiII be good for you.
- Demon. - God, save me.

94
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,120
What a wonder! What a wonder!
The room is fiIIed..

95
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,640
..Iike a one-day
internationaI cricket stadium.

96
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,080
What an attention ! What an
attention ! - It's not attention..

97
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,680
..sir, but its tension.
Give us the paper fast.

98
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,120
We too feIt the same way,
when we were giving..

99
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,280
..Iectures in the
empty cIasses. Sit down.

100
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,600
One wicket is down.
Hey, take her to paviIion.

101
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,320
Hey, do you know any answer.
- Do you know any answer?

102
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,760
Do you know any answer?

103
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,600
I know the answer.
ShaII I write the answer?

104
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
Why are you Iooking at
my face! Start writing.

105
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,680
You revised the whoIe portion,
didn't you? Now write.

106
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,120
Mind your own business!

107
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,200
My God! What a shock!

108
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Now I knew how you got
the ranks aII these days.

109
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,680
Sorry. I am weak in
this subject onIy.

110
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,480
I wrote aII the other
subjects myseIf. - Sir.

111
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,200
Someone has brought sIips.

112
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,640
SIips? Who? Where?

113
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,080
Hey, what's this?
- It's not mine.

114
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,520
So want to say that

115
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,080
Look at her, she is writing so

120
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,320
Thank you.

121
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,440
Are the answers
written on the board?

122
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,040
Sir, I have squint-eyes.
- I see. Then write it that way.

123
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Haven't you read anything?
You're good at..

124
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,720
..teIIing stories though.
The time is about to end.

125
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,680
StiII there is a Iot of time.
Anyway, I wiII start it.

126
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
Give me you pen.

Meena, I want to taIk

151
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,960
Fast? What are you saying! I feeI
Iike it took decades.

152
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,560
From today we are
getting separated..

153
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
I mean aII of us are

So I too want to taIk to you today.

160
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,320
But I am wondering what

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,960
Anyway, you are the one

162
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,640

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,480
What's the matter! Both

Don't taIk rubbish !

171
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,160
You know that I don't have
the habit of hiding things.

172
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,560
Are you coming or not?
- Ok, I am coming.

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,000

174
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,560
Ok, I wonder when we

175
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,960
Greetings, brother.
- Greetings, sir.

176
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,480
Take it.
- Greetings, sir. How are you?

177
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,040
Give me my papers.
- Madam is studying those fiIes.

178
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,200
It may take some more time.
- It wiII take some more time?

179
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,320
Where is she?

180
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,520
Greetings, madam.
Haven't you signed our papers?

181
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,160
Madam, GopaI!
- ReaI-estate-GopaI.

182
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,960
GopaI ReaI Estates. He
came for that Begumpet pIan.

183
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,640
I see. We can't give you
permission for seventh fIoor.

184
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,920
And aIso you have
extended the fifth and sixth..

185
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,920
..fIoors' baIcony. And our
engineers have reported..

186
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,560
..that you have aIso used
a cheap cement for that.

187
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,960
So, forget about the seventh fIoor..

188
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,920
..and first do something
about fifth and sixth fIoors.

189
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,320
Hey, do you know whom you
are taIking to! I'II kiII you.

190
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
Hey, how dare you to
taIk Iike that with madam!

191
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,080
How dare you !

192
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,480
They are Iike that onIy, madam.

193
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,880
They don't know
anything other than kiIIing.

194
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,920
Forgive him. Why do you want
to buy troubIes? TeII me..

195
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,920
..how much money you want!
Let's come to settIement.

196
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,920
HeIIo, Mr. Commissioner,
someone caIIed reaI estate..

197
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,440
..GopaI, is
threatening me for signature.

198
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,400
Is he there? Why do
you want to buy troubIes?

199
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,120
After aII it is just a sign.

200
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,920
Ok, Mr. GopaI, Iet's make a deaI.
Come to the Irani-cafe..

201
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,200
..opposite to the VoItas.
Come there at 3 O' cIock.

202
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,880
Thank you, madam. Goodbye.

203
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,880
Greetings, madam.
- Greetings.

204
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,200
Hey, get up. Sit down.
- It's ok. Let's sit here. - Come.

205
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,200
Madam, wouId you Iike to
have a tea? - I drank just now.

206
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,960
They suppIy tea to our office aIso.

207
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,880
Now I Iiked you,
madam. I know the saIary..

208
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,440
..that the government gives you,
isn't sufficient for you.

209
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,880
You too have sons how
study and daughters..

210
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
..who are about to
get married, don't you?

211
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,400
Take this, madam.

212
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,360
There are fifty
thousand rupees in this.

213
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,400
WeII, he is my son. As
you said, he is studying.

214
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,200
GeneraIIy he takes
care of aII these things.

215
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,880
You taIk to him and
come to a settIement, ok?

216
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,480
I have a Iot of work to
do in office. Goodbye, ok?

217
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,280
I heard that Paya of
this hoteI is very tasty.

218
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,840
Why don't you show the taste of it?

219
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,080
Brother Akbar, come here.

220
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,840
CIose the service for today.
There is fifty thousand in that.

221
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Repair the damages after a whiIe.

222
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
Take it, brother.

223
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
Show him the taste of the Paya.

224
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,080
What?

225
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,960
How is the Paya?

226
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,800
It's fine.

227
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,760
With this, our prestige has
increased tenfoId in our office.

228
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,440
Everyone is greeting us from
the poem to the commissioner.

229
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,800
Because of our the
Ioads of work in office..

230
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,800
..we missed the Iive-action.
But do teII us the next time..

231
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,040
..you bash someone. We wiII watch.
- Oh !

232
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,760
Other parents scoId their kids
when they invoIve in a fight..

233
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,400
..but you are encouraging him.
Are you his reaIIy his parents?

234
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,800
Are you reaIIy our daughter?
There shouId be son Iike him..

235
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,760
..in every house, or eIse it'd
be difficuIt. - You are right.

236
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,080
So you want to make him a rowdy?

237
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,160
This chapter won't end here.
WiII that rowdy do nothing?

238
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,040
He wiII come with some more goons.

239
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,360
So what? He wiII aIso
take some men with him.

240
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,840
And if that is not sufficient,
we wiII aIso join him.

241
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,400
O God! You onIy can save them.

242
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,400
We don't Ieave
everything on God Iike you.

243
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,400
We do what we can. Father, if
we Iive with this B.C. girI..

244
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,080
..then we too wiII
become oId-fashioned Iike her.

245
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,640
So find a boy for her urgentIy
and send her out of this house.

246
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,600
And we shaII go forward
in this fast-generation.

247
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,400
Hey, even though you are youngest..

248
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,000
..you understand our
responsibiIities very weII.

249
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,400
Anyway, since her
finaI exams are over..

250
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,440
..we shaII find a suitabIe
boy and get her married.

251
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,880
You are right.
- Wow! She is feeIing shy.

252
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:27,360
''Our Meenakshi wiII become a bride.''

253
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,600
Stop.
- Why did you shout Iike that!

254
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Are you about to give us a shock?

255
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,560
Get me married fast, so
that I couId get rid of him.

256
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,520
She too showed the green-signaI.

257
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,520
We shaII contact some
marriage-bureau fast.

258
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,400
It's not that good to depend
on these bureaus and things.

259
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,000
It better to find a suitabIe
among known to our famiIy.

260
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,360
It wouId have been so great,
if my sister was here..

261
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,880
..to Iook after aII these things.
- Is she dead?

262
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,480
What rubbish are you taIking!
- Or what eIse shouId I say!

263
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,600
Have you written your sister
even a singIe Ietter recentIy?

264
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,120
Have you at Ieast tried
to know her weII-being?

265
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,520
No, when I Iast heard about her..

266
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,880
..there was some
drought in her viIIage.

267
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,360
Even she didn't write about it.

268
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,360
KamaIa, when did we receive
the Iast Ietter from my sister?

269
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,120
See, if the new
address is written in it.

270
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,880
Check these.

271
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,960
I guess this is the Iast Ietter.

272
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,480
Mother, it seems that
you didn't even open this.

273
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,320
What? It isn't open? Give it to me.

274
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,160
This seems to be my
sister's handwriting.

275
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,800
It is in fact. You don't
even have the time in this..

276
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,840
..fast generation to read a
Ietter that came an year ago.

277
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,480
I am fine and hope you are
aIso fine aIong with your kids.

278
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,800
Since your
brother-in-Iaw passed away..

279
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,800
..my heath is deteriorating.
And there is a drought..

280
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,280
..in our viIIage. I
prayed aII the Gods for rain.

281
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,800
Even the cattIe's condition is
not weII due to the shortage..

282
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,040
..of food. Everyone is
Ieaving the viIIage.

283
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,000
I am aIso thinking of
going to another viIIage.

284
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,760
ActuaIIy I have some
shortage of money.

285
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
If possibIe pIease send
me two thousand rupees.

286
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,760
I am asking you money, since I
don't want to seII our Iand..

287
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,800
..which is the onIy thing
that our parents Ieft for us.

288
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,160
I wiII be waiting for you repIy.
Your sister, Parvati.

289
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,720
What's this, father! So
this is a fast generation..

290
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,040
..where one doesn't
even care of one's sister.

291
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,840
As Meenakshi said, it's
better if we go back to B.C. days.

292
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,760
HeIIo. Tomorrow you wiII
aIso become Iike that.

293
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,760
Today you may care for me..

294
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,480
..but after my marriage
you wiII aIso forget me.

295
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,760
You wiII aIways be thinking
about your wife, your kids..

296
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,480
..your property, your issues..
- Ok, now stop it.

297
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,760
Father, if we want to
get her married soon..

298
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,720
..then as you said your
sister can Iook for a good match..

299
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,120
..for her, so I wiII go and
bring her wherever she is.

300
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,720
ReaIIy? - Yes, I wiII bring
her here to send you out of here.

301
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,920
HaiI Goddess Meenakshi of Madhurai.

302
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,160
HaiI Goddess Kamakshi of Kanchi.

303
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,480
HaiI Goddess VishaIakshi of Kashi.

304
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,920
HeIIo, where is
Kavuri Parvatamma's house?

305
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,800
Her house is behind the
Rama tempIe in that Iane.

306
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,400
Brother.

307
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,320
I am not your brother,
aunty. I am your brother's son.

308
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,880
I can see my brother in you.

309
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,120
I hope you didn't forget us.

310
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,920
From now onwards you wiII
stay with your brother onIy.

311
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,720
Now get ready.
- Am I am the one who forgot you..

312
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,040
..or it's your father got forgot me?

313
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,200
Aunty, actuaIIy your
brother is aIso regretting this.

314
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,240
You may not know
about the government job.

315
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,720
He is aIso busy with since your
brother is a sincere officer..

316
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,480
..and your sister-in-Iaw is
aIso a government empIoyee.

317
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,720
Both are very busy peopIe.
And we are busy with our..

318
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,720
..studies and our entire home
is aIways busy. And I guess..

319
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,440
..there is no need to teII
you about our confusing city.

320
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,160
I came here to eradicate the
word 'busy', between sibIings.

321
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,800
You are my dear aunty, aren't you?

322
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,360
So forget

A girI is

00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,360
And a boy is
affectionate towards her aunty.

00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,880
..other than me?
- ShaII I bring the car?

346
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,040

355
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,160
Get aside, aunty.

356
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,040
Aunty. Aunty.

357
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,360
What happened, Parvatamma?

358
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,760
Parvatamma.

359
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,320
O no, what couId this
mishap happen ! - What happened?

360
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,640
RamuIu. Veerayya.

361
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,160
Parvatamma passed away.
- O no.

362
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,640
AII these days she was waiting
for his brother. And when his..

363
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,640
..brother sent his
son to bring her,..

364
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
..she passed away.
It's so unfortunate.

365
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,240
No eIse is there among our
sibIings, other than me.

366
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,600
Even though aII of you are with me..

367
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,040
..but I stiII feeI Iike I
have become very IoneIy.

368
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,240
I've seen the same emotions
in your sister's eyes too.

369
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,640
The onIy difference is
that you are feeIing IoneIy..

370
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,640
..after her death and
she was feeIing IoneIy..

371
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,360
..even when aII of us were there.

372
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,640
It's very unfortunate
that no one were near her..

373
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,000
..when she passed away.

374
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,640
'I wish even our enemies
shouIdn't face such a day.'

375
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,800
'I feIt Iike father
did a big mistake.'

376
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,600
'Even if we are Iiving
in a mechanicaI Iife..'

377
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,280
'..it's a big sin to
ignore our sibIings.'

378
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:24,640
'The Iast day with my
aunt made me reaIize this.'

379
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,120
Don't be naughty.
Don't gaze everywhere.

380
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,240
And get on the train as soon
as it stops on the pIatform.

381
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,840
The train doesn't stop on
this pIatform for too Iong.

382
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,080
Don't get down to
fiII the water bottIe..

383
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,840
So fiII the water bottIe forehand.

384
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,840
Now get up, you useIess feIIow!

385
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,600
If there is a man in
the Iadies compartment..

386
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,280
..then go and compIaint to the TT.

387
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,920
This is not Iike our city.
This city is fuII of rouges.

388
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,600
I brought you here to
write an entrance exam..

389
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,600
..it is a good course. Even our
tickets are aIso to be bIamed.

390
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,680
We are in the first coach and
you are in the second coach.

391
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,600
Mr. Rao, they are not kids. AII
our girIs are together.

392
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,120
ReaIIy, useIess feIIow.

393
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,560
You shouIdn't behave
according to you wish.

394
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,600
You must do whatever I said, or
eIse I'II kiII you. Last time..

395
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,920
..too I toId you many things,
but you didn't Iisten to me.

396
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,560
If you don't Iisten to me again,
I'II definiteIy kiII you this time.

397
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
Why are you standing Iike that!
Did you get me or not?

398
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,160
And don't get down on every station.

399
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,080
And don't buy aII the junk food.

400
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,920
I wiII be waiting
for you on our station.

401
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,240
GirIs, there is no one to
stop us for three hours.

402
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,520
HeIIo, how much is this
appIe's cost? - Ten rupees.

403
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,640
What's the cost of this one?

Hey, girIs. It's ok. Come.

00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,280
Hey, these fIowers are so nice!
- Yah, that's so beautifuI, no?

407
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,000
Give these roses.
- Yah ! They are reaIIy cute.

408
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,040

409
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,040
This one. Hey, how is this

410
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,760
This is so nice.

411
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,400
Look, there's a boy on the
bike in green checks-shirt.

412
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,360
Don't Iook aII of a sudden.
- Ok. Ok.

413
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,600
Look at him casuaIIy.

414
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,760
How does he Iook? How does he Iook?

Wow! He Iooks Iike a prince.

416
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,040
He might Iook Iike that

417
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,640
..he wiII become go mad.

418
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,360
You can't afford her, but
the nose-ring is reaIIy great.

419
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,080
You can't buy it since you
are not my eIder brother.

420
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,560
I think I shouId buy
something for you since I am eIder.

421
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,040
He might not know that we
are from a different city.

422
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,480
When we wiII come
Hyderabad next time..

You are running weII.
Give a shot at OIympics.

465
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,600
This girI seems to have some stuff.

466
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,120
After aII she made you chase
her and then she disappeared.

467
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,640
Where wiII she run? I

I wiII teII her that day.

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,920
Meena, these are the
photos the marriage bureau sent.

470
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,160
There are many boys
who work in banks.

471
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,560
Their bio-data is aIso
there behind the photo.

472
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,560
Have a Iook at it!

473
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,720
Right. There are many
urban bank directors too.

474
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,720
But the thing is that they
Iook Iike wanted persons.

475
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,880
Hey, brother. You heIp
her in seIecting a boy.

He seems to be a very
decent guy. Krushi Bank.

479
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,040
Meena, he Iooks great,
but he works in CTI Bank.

480
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,600
We can't trust them.

481
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,120
What's the matter?
Why are you Iike that?

482
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,640
Don't you Iike them?

483
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,520
Or is there someone you Iike?

484
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,600
You are even
distributing your wedding cards?

485
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,520
He's Uday.

486
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,520
He sent a Ietter to you onIy?

487
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,560
PersonaI Ietter.
- You may even read that.

488
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,600
'I Iove you. I Iove you, Meenakshi.'

489
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,000
'This is what I wanted to
teII you after our finaI exams.'

490
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,600
'You might be wondering
what this Iove-Ietter is..'

491
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,600
'..aIong with the wedding card.'

492
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,560
'I couIdn't say it to my parents.
And if I don't say this to you..'

493
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,480
'..I may not be
abIe to get you ever.'

494
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,560
'That's why I am teIIing
it, I want to marry you.'

495
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,520
'I can't express
how much I Iove you.'

496
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,520
'If you too Iove me,
then come to me.'

497
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,480
'I wiII come there, if you wish.'

498
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,480
'First Iet's go
somewhere and get married.'

499
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,520
'Our parents won't understand us.'

500
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,520
'Even your brother who is Iike
your friend won't accept it.'

501
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,520
'Everyone knows about his anger.'

502
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,560
'That's why I had no other option..'

503
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,520
'..even though that I
this is not the right way.'

504
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,600
'If you want to some, then
there're reserved train tickets..'

505
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,560
'..aIong with this Ietter.
TeII me your answer..'

506
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,560
'..on the beIow mentioned number.'

507
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,600
'I wiII be waiting for
your repIy, Uday.' - Ticket.

508
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,560
What a shock, Uday!
- What shaII I do now?

509
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,640
ShaII I run away?
- I wiII kiII you.

510
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,000
Then teII me what I shaII do.
- How wiII I teII! You teII me.

511
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,840
Ok, then, Iisten. I too Iike Uday.

512
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,160
Instead of marrying
someone unknown so caIIed..

513
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,520
..white coIIared officers,
it's better to marry..

514
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,520
..a cIassmate whom I
know since four years.

515
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,560
As far as I know, not
onIy with me but he didn't..

516
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,640
..misbehave with any girI. And
a better quaIity than that..

517
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,560
..is that instead of teIIing
these rubbish Iove and buIIshit..

518
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,560
..he asked me to marry him
and more than anything eIse..

519
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,560
..I too Iike him a Iot.
- I see.

520
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,640
So you went this far?
- I haven't gone tiII now..

521
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,000
..but I feeI Iike going
to any extent for him.

522
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,000
Ok, Ieave this to me. I
wiII take care of this.

523
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,800
ReaIIy? Everyone
knows about your anger.

524
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,520
But you don't know
about your brother's heart.

525
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,960
Anyway, where does he Iive?
- Madhurai.

526
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,480
Swami.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,520
Have you brought the fIowers?
- Yes, sir.

528
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,520
The auspicious time is here.
We'II go to Mother's tempIe..

529
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,800
Ok, madam.
- Do it, fast. - Fast.

530
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,520
Narayana, Sir is coming down.

531
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,520
Offer this to Mother in
the name of our son Uday's..

532
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,520
..marriage. - We brought
these to offer to mother..

533
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,800
..on the occasion of
our son's marriage.

534
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,520
Sir, you offer something
or other thing to Mother..

535
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,560
..on every occasion. - That's
not our greatness, Mr. Priest.

536
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,040
Mother gave it to us and we
are giving it back to Mother.

537
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,480
Because of Mother's mercy
on you, you got a match..

538
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,560
..from Govindaraju's
famiIy for your son.

539
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,520
Is that the vermiIion which
was offered to Mother? - Yes.

540
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,480
PIease give to me.
- You were born to show peopIe..

541
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,480
..how a perfect
husband and wife shouId be.

542
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,400
Sir, Mr. GovindarajuIu is coming.

543
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,440
The father of the bride is coming.

544
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,920
WeIcome. WeIcome. WeIcome.
- Greetings.

545
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,600
Did you come to see how the
arrangements are going on?

546
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,440
No, I came to ask to
postpone the marriage.

547
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,880
Brother! Does your
daughter have any probIem?

548
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,440
That's not the thing, sister.
ActuaIIy new commissioner is..

549
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,560
Mr. RatnaveIu.
- Right.

550
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,480
He has fiIed an
encroachment case on me.

551
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,720
He wants to arrest me on the
marriage-day and troubIe me.

552
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,560
What are you saying!
ShaII I go and taIk to him?

553
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,480
He won't Iisten to anyone.
That's why I am trying to..

554
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,560
..soIve this matter by
taIking to the minister in DeIhi.

555
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,480
And if something goes
wrong during marriage..

556
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,440
..then it wiII be
embarrassing to aII of us. - You are..

557
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,480
I feeI Iike postponing this
marriage this the issue soIves.

558
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:39,440
Brother, you don't worry.
BaIa, you caII that commissioner.

559
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,920
Kuppaswami. - Sir. -
Bring that phone. - Ok, sir.

560
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,520
Both Andhra CM and TamiI
Nadu's CM are coming..

561
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,440
..to the marriage ceremony.
That's why I caIIed you..

562
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,480
..to taIk about the security.
The reception wouId be..

563
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,480
..heId over there. I
guess there wouId be around..

564
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,440
..thousand peopIe be
eating in every batch. - Ok.

565
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,440
And I heard that your native
pIace is Coimbatore, right?

566
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,720
I heard that you
are Naidus, are you?

567
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,440
Getting married to a son
is so difficuIt these days..

568
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,440
..and I heard that
you have two daughters.

569
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,440
And you are aIso a very honest man.

570
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,440
Then how wiII you give dowry?

571
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,880
There are many guys
who won't take dowry.

572
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,440
We don't find peopIe
Iike you these days.

573
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,480
And by the way, do you
have any ancestraI property?

574
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,520
My onIy property is the IPS
certificate that is earned.

575
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,520
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

576
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,680
PIease sit down. I
am sorry I am Iate.

577
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,480
I too came just a few minutes ago.

578
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,440
PIease eat. ActuaIIy I
was taIking to my son's..

579
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,440
..future father-in-Iaw,
I mean, Mr. Govindaraju..

580
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,440
Excuse me, sir. If you
caIIed me to taIk about him..

581
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,400
..then I wiII have to go
without even eating the Iunch.

582
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,360
PIease don't be that angry.
You can arrest him Iater..

583
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,360
..but first have you Iunch.

584
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,440
ActuaIIy I was thinking that
if you can deIay the arresting..

585
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,520
..tiII the marriage is over.
He is a very reputed person.

586
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,520
Sir, he is a very
reputed person, but the money..

587
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,480
..he earned iIIegaIIy
speaks everything about the man.

588
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,680
I have many soIid
evidences against him.

589
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,440
Many other reputed persons
wiII aIso be unmasked soon.

590
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,360
Is there some curd?
- Here it is.

591
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,320
What are you doing! You
caIIed him for Iunch..

592
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,440
..but you are taIking about arrest.

593
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,440
I was just taIking to
brother about him daughters.

594
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,400
He was saying that he wouId
get his daughters married..

595
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,320
..without giving dowry. Each
person is a unique person.

596
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,400
Where shouId I wash my hands?
- Come.

597
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,520
You shaII wash your
hands there. Keep it here.

598
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,320
Hey, who's there? Mr.
Commissioner fainted..

599
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,280
..and feII down. CaII
the ambuIance. - Ok, madam.

600
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,360
Why are you Iooking at me Iike that?

601
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,320
I Iike your eyes.

602
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,320
Your eyes don't Iike
what my eyes don't Iike.

603
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,360
I Iike your hands.

604
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,320
These hands kiII the
persons whom I don't Iike.

605
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,800
It's a great fortune to
get an understanding wife.

606
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,840
And it is the greatest fortune
to get a wife who murders others.

607
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,480
You are so cute, my
beautifuI bIack girI!

608
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,320
What did you ask for?
- Nothing.

609
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,520
Nothing? You must have
prayed for your Iover.

610
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,640
There is nothing Iike that.

611
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,360
Hey, Hyderabad! Hyderabad!

612
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,640
Hey, did Meenakshi give a caII?
- No, she didn't.

613
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,480
Have you written the
number correctIy in the phone?

614
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,440
Yes, I wrote it correctIy.
What if she is coming on train?

615
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,360
Our men are at the station too.
Do you think that that girI..

616
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,880
..wiII come? - You are the
man, and you are afraid..

617
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,400
..of your parents, then
how can you expect a girI..

618
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,360
..to come her
against her parents' wish.

619
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,360
I have faith on her.
- There is no use in getting tensed.

620
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,360
I think we shouId give
a caII to her house.

621
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,280
No, we can't. If his brother
picks the phone then he wiII..

622
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,320
Hey, bridegroom, how many
years did we study together?

623
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,760
Four years.
- Four years! There four years..

624
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,360
..you we not onIy
Meenakshi's cIassmate..

625
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,360
..but you were aIso my cIassmate.

626
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,320
Even I was your friend, wasn't I?

627
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,840
How can your betray one
person to Iove another!

628
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,360
ShaII we go aside and taIk?
- How dare you to ask..

629
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,360
..Meenakshi to run away!

630
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,440
Son, there is a minister.
Come and meet him once.

631
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,800
Your uncIe sent a Benz Car for
you. It's your marriage-gift.

632
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,760
You must see that girI.
She is fiIIed with goId.

633
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,440
There isn't an empty
pIace even to touch her.

634
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,320
Is he friend? Send
him to the guest house.

635
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,360
Here you are getting marriage and..

636
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,360
..you asked my sister to run away?

637
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,360
We shaII go aside and taIk.
- I don't Iike taIking behind..

638
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,760
..one's back. If you have
courage then, say it braveIy.

639
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,600
What's your finaI decision?
- Who are you?

640
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,600
What are you saying?
- Greetings.

641
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,400
Greetings.
- I came from Hyderabad.

642
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,320
This is the Ietter your
son wrote to my sister.

643
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,280
You Ioving my
sister isn't a mistake..

644
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,320
..but asking her to
run away is a mistake.

645
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,760
Even if you give such a cheap
advice she wiII never do it.

646
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,760
That's how much my
sister respects us.

647
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,720
In the same way we too
respect her and her opinions.

648
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,560
We respect her opinion when
she said that she Ioves you..

649
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,560
..and if your parents
aIso respect your decision..

650
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,600
..then I don't have any probIem
in getting her married to you.

651
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,720
Boy, shaII we go aside and taIk?

652
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,320
I am sorry. I don't Iike
taIking behind someone's back.

653
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,720
I can understand your situation.

654
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,560
I came here before the
reputation of both the famiIies..

655
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,280
..wouId have shattered.

656
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,760
Or eIse you know
what your son was up to.

657
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,320
Uday, I am not forcing you
in any way. If you reaIIy..

658
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,560
..want to marry my sister,
then say it to your parents.

659
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,400
And if you too accept
your son's decision..

660
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,240
..then this marriage won't happen.

661
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,280
Before accepting your
son's decision you must..

662
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,320
..aIso know about our famiIy first.

663
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:56,560
Mother. Father.
- Come.

664
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,400
We are sorry that we are
introducing ourseIves..

665
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,520
..in such circumstances.

666
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,280
My name is Anand Rao.
I am working as a..

667
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,360
..section in-charge and
she is my wife, KamaIa..

668
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,280
She works in the same
office as a section officer.

669
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,400
We aIso buiIt a house recentIy.

670
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,560
We are pIanning to give
that house to our daughter.

671
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,800
Our son said that he
didn't want any share in that.

672
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,920
Or course, we can't even
compete with your cIerk..

673
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,240
..but Mother Goddess
has given us a Iot of..

674
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,280
..truthfuIness and honesty.
- We are saying it in..

675
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,800
..the tempIe of Mother.
Our daughter is goId.

676
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,320
We too Iove our chiId as
much as your Iove your chiId.

677
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,280
We too can't Ieave our
daughter that easiIy.

678
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,760
That's why I am teIIing you,
Iet's go aside and taIk.

679
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,560
PIease come. - Now whatever is
there taIk, taIk to our son.

680
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,560
You come.
- Be carefuI. He is a very wise kid.

681
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,560
Brother, you taIked in a great way.

682
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:57,360
I am eIder than you, so Iisten
to me, Iet's go aside and taIk.

683
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,360
Come, brother.

684
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,400
This is a match of
more than 1000 crores.

685
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,240
And we are one of the most
reputed famiIies in the country.

686
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
This is not a doII's marriage,
that we can do..

687
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,520
..since our kids want.
- You caIm down, dear.

688
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,680
Look, brother. Find a match of you
r status for your sister..

689
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,720
And don't worry about the money.

690
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,520
I wiII give you even if
you need crores of rupees.

691
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,560
There isn't any currency
this worId which can buy Iove.

692
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,360
And we don't crores of rupees
to Iive with Iove and honesty.

693
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,240
Look, brother.
- You keep quiet, BaIa.

694
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,320
You can see what kind of
a courageous kid he is.

695
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,240
You came from some TeIugu province..

696
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,280
..and want to get her
married here in TamiI Nadu?

697
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,320
If your sister wiII be near you,
it wiII be good for you onIy.

698
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,680
He won't Iisten to us Iike that.
- Mr. MLA is here.

699
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,520
WeIcome him and taIk to him.
- Brother! Listen to me.

700
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,680
You don't know about me. I
worship peopIe if I Iike them..

701
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,240
..or eIse I break peopIe's Iegs.
- I am taIking in this way..

702
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:52,280
..just because of the onIy
reason that my sister Iikes you.

703
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,240
Or eIse breaking someone into
pieces isn't new to me either.

704
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,160
Uday.

705
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,240
Just Ioving isn't enough,
but you shouId aIso have..

706
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,240
..the courage to convince eIders.

707
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,320
Even my sister won't Iike to
Iead her Iife with a coward.

708
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,240
The marriage is tomorrow morning.

709
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,360
Think about it and
take a decision by then.

710
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,360
It's not right on my part to
ask you to take a decision..

711
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,320
..without showing my
sister. Look there.

712
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,200
The girI who waIking down
the stairs is my sister.

713
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,360
She may not be very rich,
but she is as precious as goId.

714
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,160

''The powerfuI Meenakshi is
Goddess VishaIaskhi in Kashi.''

767
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,600
They say that our son gave
her a card on her birthday..

768
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,640
..and that's aII. When those
twins threatened our son..

769
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,040
..he married her so that our
reputation shouIdn't hamper.

770
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,680
Father, you gave me
everything that I asked you..

771
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,040
..since chiIdhood. I am
asking you something..

772
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:57,040
..for the Iast time. I want
Uday. If someone tied me..

773
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,520
..the auspicious thread,
then it shouId be Uday.

774
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,720
Even though we have so much weaIth,
it isn't equaI to Uday.

775
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,560
I stiII Iove him.

776
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,600
I need him. I wiII die if I
don't get Uday. - Aishwarya.

777
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,520
Such is my destiny. There
are many boys interested..

778
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,680
..in marrying her, but she
wants to marry your son..

779
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,600
..who is aIready married.
- Brother-in-Iaw, it's our fortune.

780
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,600
No, it's our son's fortune.

781
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,040
It is his fortune to get such
a Ioving wife. What do you say?

782
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,560
You don't worry. From now,
we wiII write his destiny.

783
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,640
We wiII get him out of
that demon's trap. Trust me.

784
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,680
Yes, I know that you can.
You are very good at..

785
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,000
..removing your obstacIes.
- But, it isn't that sir.

786
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,000
ActuaIIy her brother
is our biggest enemy.

787
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,000
He just came, said a few words..

788
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,000
..and got my son marry his sister.

789
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,080
He stabbed us so
easiIy without even a knife.

790
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,600
That's why I am teIIing you,
the sooner you take our..

791
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,560
..Aishwarya to your home,
the better for you.

792
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,680
When we counted our property
Iast time, it was 1001 crores.

793
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,680
I wiII my entire property on
my daughter's name yesterday.

794
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,080
I haven't seen her crying tiII now.

795
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,680
Brother-in-Iaw, you
don't worry at aII.

796
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,000
You go to America and take
care of your business there.

797
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,480
And before going as
we taIked earIier..

798
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,560
..you said that you wouId
give a share in that contract.

799
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,640
I wiII give you. But before
that Iet my daughter get..

800
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,640
..married to your son. If you
deIay it, anything may happen.

801
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,680
..even my daughter mind may change..

802
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
..and even mind wouId change.

803
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,520
What are saying! Legs,
Iegs. HoId his Iegs.

804
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,520
There is no use of him anymore.
He has aIready..

805
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,520
..wiIIed his property
in his daughter's name.

806
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,560
He can be a hurdIe to use anytime.

807
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,800
Aishwarya! Aishwarya! You
father had a heart attack.

808
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,920
Aishwarya! Aishwarya! You
father had a heart attack.

809
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,960
Hey, is anyone there? Come here.

810
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,080
You go and caII the doctor.

811
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,560
Brother. Brother. What
happened to you, brother!

812
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:23,520
Brother. Brother. O no.

813
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,520
What happened?
- He has a heart attack.

814
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,520
We are taking him to the hospitaI.

815
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,960
Come this way. Easy. Easy.

816
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,440
HoId him.

817
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:46,520
Come fast, dear. I wiII give
you a caII from there. - Ok.

818
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,920
Fast. Fast.
- You too came fast, daughter.

819
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,520
You keep going. I wiII come.
- Ok.

820
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,560
My dear.

821
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,600
If there is your heIp to me, I
can even conquer this worId.

822
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,520
There are very few
coupIes who understand..

823
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,960
..each other weII and
we are first among them.

824
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,480
You are right. If
Mandodari heIped Ravana Iike you..

825
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,520
..Ravana wouId have been the winner.

826
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,920
Not onIy that, if
LeeIavati was Iike you..

827
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,480
..then there'd have been no
stopping to Hiranayakashyapa.

828
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,800
O come on, BaIa.
- I am saying the truth.

829
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,920
You are a roIe modeI wife.

830
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,520
What happened, BaIa?
Why did you get scare..

831
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,520
..by a dead man !
- That's not the thing.

832
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,520
I thought he was aIive
when his hand feII on me.

833
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:42,600
No one has the right to Iive,
when we decide to kiII them.

834
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,920
Anyway, when are kiIIing Meenakshi?

835
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,760
We shouIdn't get so anxious.

836
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,480
She is the girI whom our son Ioved.
Let him enjoy her first.

837
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,480
Then we can kiII her
in a convincing way.

838
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,480
So that he wouIdn't have any doubt.

839
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,480
His brother is the one who
shouIdn't have any doubt.

840
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,560
If we kiII him first, then
we won't have any hurdIe.

841
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,560
We wiII get 1000 crores.
- Not 1000 crores, BaIa.

842
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,600
shaII go to our doctor..

843
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,520
..and get the death report
that he died due to heart attack.

844
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,000
Son, Uday. More than getting sepa
rated from our daughter..

845
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,480
..we are more worried
about your parents' attitude..

846
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,480
..who were against this marriage.

847
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,480
Meenakshi, it's not sufficient
to just get your beIoved one..

848
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,480
..but your true test
wiII be winning the peopIe..

849
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,440
..who were against this marriage.
- Hey, Narayana.

850
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,480
Spray water in the garden.
- Ok, sir.

851
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,560
So what was your name?
- Her name is Meenakshi.

852
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,440
Come upstairs.

853
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,480
Since we were going
to the tempIe daiIy..

854
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,880
..Mother Meenakshi had mercy
on us and sent this Meenakshi.

855
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,440
My dear!
- WeII-said, dear.

856
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,560
Since she didn't want any
other girI to enter this house..

857
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,560
..so Mother herseIf
came to this house..

858
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,560
..in the form of
this beautifuI girI.

859
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,440
What is this, brother-in-Iaw!
You shouId have stayed here..

860
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,440
..for some more days.
There are many sights..

861
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,440
..that your haven't
visited in this city.

862
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,440
Give it hear. Dear, come.

863
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,480
What can be a better
sight for us that this!

864
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,560
It's our fortune that
our daughter became..

865
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,440
..the daughter-in-Iaw of this house.

866
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,960
She must have done good
deeds is some previous birth..

867
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,360
Forgive me, sir, if I
had crossed the Iine.

868
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,480
O, come on. Look, he
is caIIing me sir.

869
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,440
He is your father-in-Iaw.
If I had a daughter..

870
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,520
..I wouId have got her married
to you. - But one condition.

871
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:59,360
What's that?
- I'd have married her..

872
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,360
..onIy if her was
aIso as sIim as you are.

873
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,520
You too have a very good
sense of humor. - WeII-said.

874
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,800
Hey, Narayana.
- Yes, sir.

875
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,840
You must go to the station
and get them on the train.

876
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,440
Did you get me?
- Yes, sir.

877
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,440
Goodbye, uncIe. Goodbye, aunty.
- Ok.

878
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,960
Ok, goodbye.
- Ok. HoId on. You wait.

879
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,440
You didn't eat
anything since morning.

880
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,440
At Ieast eat this banana.

881
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,560
What's the matter! Is
my son-in-Iaw crying?

882
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,400
I wiII break it for you. Take it.

883
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,680
Goodbye, uncIe.
- Ok.

884
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,400
Goodbye.
- Ok.

885
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,400
Give me a caII before Ieaving.
- Ok.

886
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,440
Daughter, shaII we go inside? Come.
- Hey, come.

887
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,640
Hey, make it sharper.
- Ok.

888
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,480
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

889
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,800
Take one of the sharpest
knives and go to Hyderabad.

890
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,480
ShaII I gift it to someone?
- No, you fooI.

891
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,840
I want you to kiII someone.
- Ok, sir.

892
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,360
These knives Iike
the taste of the bIood.

893
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,480
And they are dying for bIood.

894
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,800
And whom shouId I kiII? A
minister or a commissioner?

895
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,360
A boy?
- You want me to kiII a boy?

896
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:02,360
If I send my photo with a knife,
he wiII get a heart attack.

897
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,400
Don't underestimate him.
He is a student. Be carefuI.

898
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,800
He departed to Hyderabad
just now. You too go now.

899
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,480
You don't worry, sir. I wiII
bring his head within three days.

900
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,320
Hey.

901
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,320
Sorry.
- Sorry?

902
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,840
I guess he don't
understand what sorry means.

903
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,360
Speak to him in your own Ianguage.

904
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,280
Then he wiII understand.

905
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,440
Poor guy. He didn't
Iisten to us at first.

906
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,280
Anyway, who is he, who
had a fight intentionaIIy?

907
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,320
Yes, it was intentionaI.
How can his men come here..

908
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,720
..aII of a sudden
aIong with their knives!

909
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,280
It seems that someone
did it intentionaIIy.

910
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,320
Are they Nayakar's men? They
didn't Iike our match too.

911
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,320
If this happened to us,
what wouId have happened..

912
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,320
..to Meenakshi?
- What shaII we do?

913
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,200
ShaII we go back to
Madhurai from next train?

914
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,400
We can't wait for that Iong.
I think we'd hire a car..

915
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,280
..go there right now. - I'II
give a caII to Meenakshi right now.

916
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,280
What rubbish are you taIking!
You sent such a person that..

917
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,240
Hey.

918
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,320
Is that he?
- So he is the one who did it?

919
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,280
It seems he didn't
Iearn this Iesson tiII now.

920
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,400
We doubted Nayakar unnecessariIy.

921
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,680
You are one who doubted him first.

922
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,240
Whoever might have
doubted him first..

923
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,240
..we shaII give a caII to
Meenakshi to cIear the doubt.

924
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,360
HeIIo. - HeIIo, Meena. -
You aIready reached there?

925
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,560
How are you? Are you fine?

926
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,280
What are you asking Iike that?
I am definiteIy fine.

927
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,280
How was your journey?
And aIso Uday got a seat..

928
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,560
..in CaIifornia.
- ReaIIy? Congrats.

929
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,720
You give a caII to your
brother-in-Iaw and congratuIate him.

930
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,560
I wiII taIk to her.
HeIIo, Meena. How are you?

931
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,240
I am fine. Are you fine?
- Yes, we are fine.

932
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,680
HoId on, your father
wants to taIk to you.

933
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,280
Dear, take care of your heaIth.
- Ok, father.

934
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,840
Ok, goodbye, father.
- Ok.

935
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,240
'When they accepted
Meenakshi as their daughter-in-Iaw..'

936
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,400
'..we thought that he
entered a heaven-Iike house.'

937
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,360
'But we never imagined that we
Ieft our Meenakshi in heII.'

938
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,200
'Come, bastards. Come.'

939
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:41,680
'I am ready for you.'

940
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,680
'I wiII kiII aII of you.'

941
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,680
'I couIdn't beIieve
when we knew the truth.'

942
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:22,240
'By then many things that
shouIdn't have happened..'

943
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,240
'..had happened.'

944
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,320
'If everyone negIects their
sibIings after marriage..'

945
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,800
'..then there'd be no
difference between bIood and water.'

946
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,720
'Because there is
nothing as thick as bIood..'

947
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,440
'..at times it burns with anger.'

948
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,440
He is not an ordinary person,
sir. He is a very strong man.

949
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,320
Did I send you make this discovery?

950
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,320
What are your knives for?
Why do your worship them?

951
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,320
You said that he wouId
get a heart attack..

952
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,440
..when he sees your photo.
What happened now?

953
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,320
He isn't abIe to Iook
straight into our eyes now.

954
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,920
Turn this way. - I can't show
you my face tiII I kiII him.

955
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,440
From now onwards this
is not just revenge..

956
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,320
..this is my revenge too. I
swear on God, I wiII kiII him.

957
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,240
I wiII see.

958
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,360
You said that Iet him enjoy.
But now she is pregnant.

959
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:54,320
When wiII her time come?
- From now onwards..

960
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,320
..every moment is a
dangerous moment for her.

961
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,320
Our son trust us
compIeteIy that we treat..

962
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,760
..our daughter-in-Iaw as goddess.

963
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,760
We shouId kiII her now.

964
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:08,320
The way he stabbed
us with his words..

965
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:12,280
..now we have to kiII
his sister that way.

966
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,720
We must kiII those twins at once.
- Right.

967
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,760
Meenakshi.
- Mother-in-Iaw.

968
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,360
Father-in-Iaw went to bath.
There isn't water in the tank.

969
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,280
WiII you pIease go and
switch on the motor?

970
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,280
O no. It seems no one
fiIIed the tanker at morning.

971
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,280
AII the servants
went on a Ieave at once.

972
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,200
It's you?

973
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,720
Demon ! When did you come?
- Just now.

974
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,560
What a surprise! - I feIt
Iike coming here, so I came.

975
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,280
I toId you that we don't
need speciaI occasions..

976
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,280
..to meet our near ones.
Not onIy me, but I aIso..

977
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,320
..brought mother and
father. Go and see.

978
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,200
Father.

979
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,280
Mother.
- How are you, dear?

980
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,280
I am fine.
- How are you, dear?

981
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,280
I am fine, father. Come.

982
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,400
Is this true? I didn't see you.

983
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,480
When did you come, sister-in-Iaw?

984
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,200
Why didn't you give us
a caII before coming?

985
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,240
One can visit onIy a
daughter without informing.

986
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,560
There's a saying is
our province, sister.

987
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,760
We can see who came
to guests by Iooking..

988
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,280
..at the footwear.
- How's that?

989
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,240
If the footwear at the door,
then the guests are from..

990
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,240
..the son's side, and if the
footwear are near kitchen..

991
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,240
..then the guests are
from daughter-in-Iaw's side.

992
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:13,680
Then Iet's do one thing. Let's
fix a shoe-stand near kitchen.

993
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,360
What's the matter, uncIe?
What's that get-up about?

994
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,520
Has aunty..
- No, that's not the thing.

995
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,280
ActuaIIy I was about to
take a bath and I heard you.

996
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:24,280
Wait for a moment! I
wiII switch on the motor.

997
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,160
Come on ! Our guests are here.

998
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,520
O, no. I forgot to
switch on the motor.

999
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,160
You stop here. There is a
surprise for you. - What's that?

1000
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:34,560
Come, Iet's go inside.
- Come inside, sister-in-Iaw.

1001
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,880
See, what I brought for you.
- Thanks.

1002
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,840
You go inside. I wiII switch
on the motor. - Stop here.

1003
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,000
Where is our son-in-Iaw?
He isn't here?

1004
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,680
He went outside. He
wiII be back in a moment.

1005
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,960
Is our daughter troubIing you?

1006
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:49,640
TroubIe! She is troubIing me a Iot!

1007
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,840
Mother-in-Iaw, eat this.
Mother-in-Iaw, eat that.

1008
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,600
Mother-in-Iaw, sIeep here.
Mother-in-Iaw, sIeep there.

1009
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,600
She isn't Ietting me
do even a singIe thing.

1010
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:00,000
You didn't even so many
marks even in the coIIege.

1011
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,000
But you got cent percent
marks at your mother-in-Iaw.

1012
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,640
Mother-in-Iaw, how is this
nose-ring? - Show that to me.

1013
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,840
I wiII switch on the motor.
- Wow!

1014
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,560
There was onIy one
difference between Goddess Meenakshi..

1015
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,680
..and our Meenakshi and
that was the nose-ring.

1016
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,560
Now there isn't any
difference at aII. Am I right, dear?

1017
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,520
Where is he?
- He went to switch on the motor.

1018
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,520
BaIa.

1019
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,640
Aunty, you stay there.
You stay there, aunty.

1020
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,560
BaIa.

1021
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,560
Sorry, uncIe. I had to
kick you with my shoe..

1022
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,960
..since I too wouId have got
a shock, if I touched you.

1023
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,640
So what? You saved his Iife.

1024
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:52,520
Come, uncIe.

01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,520
What have you done! Didn't I
teII you to get it checked..

1026
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,520
I toId you its rainy season

1027
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:02,560
You pIease go inside.

1028
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:08,800
Why didn't you teII

1029
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:18,080
Here is the hoIy offering.
Mother, why don't you..

01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,520

coupIe of days more!

1031
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,560
No, dear. One shouIdn't
stay at daughter's house..

1032
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,520
..for too many days. - Anyway,

I can't stay away from Hyderabad.

1036
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,520
And anyway, what's
there in Madhurai!

1037
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,640
You can't do it. You
shouId better commit suicide.

1038
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:46,600
Hey, you won't get
anything here. Get Iost. Get Iost.

1039
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,960
UncIe, who's he? - He wanted specia

I said that it
wasn't possibIe. Hey, you.

01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,840
I heard that you

Why don't you stay

''Your tune is great''

1122
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,560
Meenakshi, I am taIking to you.

Yes, dear. Go and visit the tempIe.

1133
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,080
By the way, where is that tempIe?

From there come to our estate.

O, come on.

1142

Dear, do you think those
twins wouId have died by now?

1143
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,280
Yes, this is the
most dangerous time..

1144
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,800
..according to the astroIogy.
They wiII definiteIy die.

1145
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,440
That means Govinraju's

1146
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:13,480
It's not 1000, but
it is 1001 crores.

1147
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:15,480
My dear! You are very
good at mathematics.

1148
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,000
You went on Safari, but you
returned on an Auto-rickshaw?

1149
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,760
We just escaped on Safari.
- You escaped?

1150
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,440
That means there was an accident?

1151
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,440
Safari's brakes faiIed.
- What! Did something happen to you?

1152
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,440
You are aIso a pregnant Iady.
- Where is driver Narayana?

1153
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,240
What can he do about it, uncIe..

1154
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,440
..when the brakes faiIed.
- Today it's a very good day.

1155
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:45,760
Thank God, both of you escaped.
- Come, dear.

1156
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,640
Our Goddess saved you.
Come, Iet's visit tempIe.

1157
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,640
She is tensed
because of the accident.

1158
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,800
How can she go to tempIe now!

1159
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,680
Are you worrying, daughter?
ShaII we go to home first?

1160
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,240
It's ok, mother-in-Iaw.
- Anyway, since we came here..

1161
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,440
..we wiII see it. Is this the
pIace from the commissioner..

1162
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,440
..has been pushed?
- Who? - We didn't get you.

1163
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,280
There was a big
sensation in the newspaper..

1164
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:03,680
..that someone pushed
the commissioner from here.

1165
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:07,000
No one pushed him, nephew! He
had some iIIness. - IIIness?

1166
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:11,000
Vertigo. - With which
they faint, that iIIness.

1167
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,440
What's the need to taIk
about those things now?

1168
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,440
Nephew, come. I wiII show
you the pIan of this buiIding.

1169
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,400
It's great, uncIe. - It's great,
but there is a probIem.

1170
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,760
There is a Iot of vacant space Ieft.

1171
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,400
Our engineer is giving
us some ideas, but..

1172
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,240
Hey, you are aIso an
engineering student..

1173
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,640
Give me a pIan.
- What pIan can I give, uncIe?

1174
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:32,400
You said it right.
Nephew can give a good idea.

1175
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:37,000
You think about it and teII
me. Hey, are the meaIs ready?

1176
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:45,720
Can you see that pIace? From
there to there is our Iand.

1177
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,640
You uncIe wiIIed
that pIace in your name.

1178
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,760
Brother.

1179
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,400
Someone save me.

1180
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:23,640
BaIa.

1181
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:27,240
Dear.

1182
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,880
O God!

1183
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,800
O dear.

1184
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:53,240
O dear, get down. Get down.

1185
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,240
Are you ok?
- Am I stiII aIive?

1186
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,720
Don't taIk Iike that.

1187
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,600
Thank you, son. How
can I pay you for this!

1188
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,600
If you wouIdn't have
saved her, I wouId have died.

1189
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:14,360
O, pIease don't
speak Iike that, uncIe.

1190
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,720
Anyway, how did you
faII in that, aunty?

1191
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,600
Our time is going bad.
- Aunty, Are you fine?

1192
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:23,200
Nothing happened to
her. I stopped her..

1193
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,360
..when she said that we
shouId go to the tempIe.

1194
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,560
That's why this happened.
Come, Iet's go to tempIe.

1195
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:35,720
HeIIo, Mr. Narsarao.
- Who's that?

1196
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,360
Is it true that you are
visiting anger management centre?

1197
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,520
Who said that? Who is
that useIess feIIow?

1198
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,560
I got it. He might have Iied to me.

1199
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,720
ShaII we go into the tempIe, father?

1200
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,240
UseIess feIIow!
- What's that! - Nothing.

1201
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:56,040
Mr. Priest, offer this to
Mother so that I'd get a promotion.

1202
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:59,360
If you need to appIy petition,
then go to Mother Jaya.

1203
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,240
I know whom we shouId ask what.

1204
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:03,600
You pronounce the chants weII.
You cIose your eyes.

1205
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,840
'Mother, even if I don't pass
in my exams, I won't compIain..'

1206
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,040
'..but get my father
transferred to Rajasthan.'

1207
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,040
'..and if possibIe
transfer him to Pakistan.'

1208
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,240
'Or eIse at Ieast make me deaf.'

1209
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,000
What did you ask for?
The Iight went off.

1210
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,360
I prayed for your promotion.
- I wiII think about my probIems.

1211
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,240
You just think about
your own probIems.

1212
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,840
Pray mother to pass in the exams..

1213
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,600
..and to get a husband Iike
Lord Krishna. - Like Krishna?

1214
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,000
No, I am Lord Rama. Pray
for a husband Iike Sri Rama.

1215
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:38,880
CIose your eyes.
- Mother, don't give me a husband..

1216
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,000
..Iike Rama or Krishna.
But send a husband Iike..

1217
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:44,240
..Ravanasa for me. He wiII be
a perfect match for my father.

1218
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:56,920
Don't keep your mouth Iike
that. The fIies may get in.

1219
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,040
That day you gave me a
fIying kiss in Hyderabad.

1220
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:21,560
Are you that attracted
towards me? Do you know peopIe..

1221
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:24,680
..give fIying kisses? When the
person whom we want to kiss..

1222
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,680
..isn't near us. I came near you
so that it wouId be convenient..

1223
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,680
..for you. Kiss me. Kiss me.

1224
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:30,920
What did you ask my daughter?

1225
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,840
Muddupedatava(wiII you kiss me)?
- What!

1226
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,680
Muddukedatava(WiII
you move forward)?

1227
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,920
You come with me.
- Save me Mother.

1228
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,880
Muddu(Kiss). Mundu(Go forward).

1229
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
You come here. Worship these Gods.

1230
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,640
What did you scream Iike that?

1231
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,240
I feIt Iike something has bitten
me. - ReaIIy? I wiII sIice you.

1232
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,840
Focus on God. CIose your eyes.

1233
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:44,000
What happened to you, father?
- Something has bitten me too.

1234
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,920
I guess Mother is
angry with us. Come.

1235
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Rupa.

1236
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:04,640
Who's that? Who caIIed you?
- I don't know, father.

1237
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,240
Then who's it? It seems
that it was a man's voice.

1238
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,600
Come. Not that way, but this way.

1239
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,720
Rupa.

1240
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,920
Why is someone caIIing you onIy?

1241
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,600
Is he that person?
- No.

1242
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,360
Then whose voice was that.
How do you know him?

1243
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,560
Since how many
days is this going on?

1244
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:27,200
Did you come to
tempIe to worship God..

1245
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:28,560
..or meet that person?
TeII me. TeII me the truth.

1246
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,320
Why are you revoIving around us?
- Muddu(Kiss).

1247
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,360
What!
- Mokku(A part of worship)

1248
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,320
Then why are you revoIving
round us? - Mokku. Mokku.

1249
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:38,560
Oh ! The hoIy ring.
Mother, forgive us.

1250
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:43,480
Not once, but you must dip thrice.

1251
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,640
Rupa.

1252
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,680
PIease, I beg you. Leave me.

1253
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,360
My father wiII kiII me.
PIease, pIease, pIease.

1254
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:11,560
Rupa.

1255
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,520
Where has she gone? Has she sunk?

1256
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,520
Rupa.

1257
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,360
Where has she gone? What's this!

1258
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,640
You dipped there and
you came out here.

1259
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,640
And where did that chain
came from in your neck?

1260
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,480
How did the chain come here
that you Iost it in Hyderabad!

1261
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,640
And where are your bangIes?
- Yes, where are they?

1262
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,520
You come here first.
Give me that chain first.

1263
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,320
Who knows what you
wiII Iose this time!

1264
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,320
Now come out from where you dip.

1265
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:54,280
Father, do I have to dip again?
No, it's enough, father.

1266
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,280
Do what I say! It's a
rituaI to dip thrice.

1267
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,440
Are you swimming inside for so Iong?

1268
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,280
What's that! Your bangIes are back?

1269
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,480
Are you trying to
fooI your own father?

1270
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,120
How did you get
your chain over here..

1271
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:15,120
..that you Iost in Hyderabad?
And how are you getting..

1272
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,840
..bangIes which you Iost once?
What's going on inside?

1273
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,480
What eIse have you Iost

1274
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:47,280
''Hey, girI. What shaII we do?''

1275
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:51,280
''Do anything, but
that thing is wrong.''

1276
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:54,280
''Hey, girI, what is wrong?''

1277
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,280
''Hey, boy, don't ask me that thing.''

1278
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:02,280
''Hey, beauty. It was a
Iot of fun beIow water.''

1279
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:04,800
''I pIayed with your beauty.''

1280
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,280
''Stop it, boy.''

1281
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:11,600
''HonestIy, even I am enjoying it.''

1282
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,280
''You can't hide that joy.''

1283
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,840
''Don't get too anxious.''

1284
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,240
''You can't hide that joy.''

1285
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,800
''Don't get too anxious.''

1286
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:30,480
''Hey, girI. What shaII we do?''

1287
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,280
''Do anything, but
that thing is wrong.''

1288
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:37,440
''Hey, girI, what is wrong?''

1289
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,520
''Hey, boy, don't ask me that thing.''

1290
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:20,240
''When are we going
to Iove in BhimiIi?''

1291
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,480
''When are we going
to start a famiIy?''

1292
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,240
''Why do you get so
anxious when I am near you?''

1293
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,480
''Even I can't resist you.''

1294
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,800
''This girI's every
part is beautifuI.''

1295
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:38,480
''I wish I couId hug her forever.''

1296
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,240
''This boy's eyes are very naughty.''

1297
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:45,560
''And this girI goes weak on knees.''

1298
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:49,200
''Hey, girI. What shaII we do?''

1299
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:52,720
''Do anything, but
that thing is wrong.''

1300
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:56,240
''Hey, girI, what is wrong?''

1301
01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:00,480
''Hey, boy, don't ask me that thing.''

1302
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,440
''I am a girI as sharp as a knife.''

1303
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,760
''You may ask it to
any boy of my city.''

1304
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:46,520
''Whatever I may do I
can quench my thirst.''

1305
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:49,760
''It isn't wrong if
accept my proposaI.''

1306
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:54,520
''Come to me tomorrow,
another fIirt Krishna.''

1307
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:57,520
''There shouId be fixed
time even for fIirting.''

1308
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:01,160
''It the effect of
Iayers of the water.''

1309
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:04,560
''PIease don't stop me.''

1310
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,200
''Hey, girI, what shaII we do?''

1311
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:12,520
''Go and order a coffee for me.''

1312
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,400
''How dare you to order me!''

1313
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:19,200
''Your pIans won't
succeed in front of me.''

1314
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:23,200
''Hey, beauty. It was a
Iot of fun beIow water.''

1315
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,400
''I pIayed with your beauty.''

1316
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,200
''Stop it, boy.''

1317
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:33,320
''HonestIy, even I am enjoying it.''

1318
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,200
''You can't hide that joy.''

1319
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:40,720
''Don't get too anxious.''

1320
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,400
''You can't hide that joy.''

1321
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,160
''Don't get too anxious.''

1322
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:58,320
Did you finaIIy come out? Now
aII the dips are over. Come.

1323
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,360
Father, may I dip three more times?

1324
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,160
You need not to. Come out.

1325
01:52:58,240 --> 01:52:59,720
What's the matter!
You are offering dips?

1326
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,480
It's for you onIy, for your weIfare.

1327
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,960
Now stop it. How come
you became so reIigious..

1328
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:07,720
..aII of a sudden?
TeII me what's the matter?

1329
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:10,720
Leave me. Do you think I am kid?
- Yes, of course.

1330
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,360
Now Iook at me, I am
about to be a mother soon.

1331
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:14,520
You first teII me.
- Leave me, I wiII teII you.

1332
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:16,440
Do you remember I toId you
about a girI in Hyderabad..

1333
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:17,560
..who fIirted with me
and disappeared? - Yes.

1334
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:20,320
And she surfaced here.
- Here? In this city?

1335
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,280
Now see, I wiII take revenge.

1336
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,320
Did you see what a coincidence!

1337
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,320
We both are getting
souI-mates in Madurai.

1338
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,120
Aishwarya, Uday is getting
prepared to go to America.

1339
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:38,960
If you go there and take
care of your businesses..

1340
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:42,320
..he wiII come and join
you Iater as we pIanned.

1341
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,920
Then your wish wiII be
fuIfiIIed and your father's souI..

1342
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,360
..wiII get peace.
- He is right, dear.

1343
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,680
And by then Meenakshi and
his brother wiII be finished.

1344
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,000
They can't escape this time.

1345
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:52,880
And when both of you'II return,
everything wiII be in pIace.

1346
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,480
If things don't get right,
then I wiII have to Iook for..

1347
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:57,680
..some other person.
- Don't speak Iike that, dear.

1348
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,680
He is yours. He beIongs to you.

1349
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,000
You can do anything
with him. Am I right?

1350
01:54:01,120 --> 01:54:02,920
Yes, and take care
of those keys, dear.

1351
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:05,920
Be carefuI.

1352
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,960
Meenakshi.
- Mother-in-Iaw.

1353
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,640
I need to grind this medicine.
Where's the stone?

1354
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,640
The stone is in the store-room.
I wiII bring it.

1355
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:47,880
Leave me. Leave me.

1356
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:54,880
Madam.

1357
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,600
What happened?
- Disaster happened, madam.

1358
01:54:58,760 --> 01:54:59,880
What happened?
- Mother-in-Iaw.

1359
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:02,200
How is that 'sindoor' on your cheek?

1360
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,640
The thing is that, mother-in-Iaw.
- Narayana.

1361
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,000
Sir. Sir.
- What happened?

1362
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:11,640
I wish I wouId have been
dead before speaking about this.

1363
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,880
Sir..
- Mother-in-Iaw, the thing is that..

1364
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:23,080
Sir. - What happened?
TeII me what happened?

1365
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:28,440
Sir, your daughter-in-Iaw
said that she Iust for me and..

1366
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:31,880
..that she wants to make
Iove with me and forced me to..

1367
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,880
Mother-in-Iaw..
- Sir.

1368
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,840
Sir, kiII me. Sir, kiII me.

1369
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:47,200
You shouIdn't have marriage
this Iady. - Mother-in-Iaw..

1370
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:55,600
Meenakshi, don't feeI tensed.
Say it sIowIy what happened.

1371
01:55:56,720 --> 01:56:00,160
Brother, he tried to..
- What's going on !

1372
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:03,480
Wait a moment, mother-in-Iaw.
Did Meenakshi go to that..

1373
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:04,920
..store-room herseIf or did
you ask someone asked her to go?

1374
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,200
I sent her.
- What for?

1375
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,600
I sent her for the stone
to grind the medicine.

1376
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,440
That means she went onIy
when you asked her to go..

1377
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:13,640
..but she didn't go there by
herseIf. How can she know..

1378
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:14,840
..that the driver is
there in the storeroom!

1379
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:18,760
Hey, you..

1380
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:23,680
My sister Iust for you? Is
that what you want to say?

1381
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:27,400
How did you face injured?
- The thing is that..

1382
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:30,960
..when I say madam and
tried to run outside.

1383
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,480
She threw a stone on me.
- If she threw a stone on you..

1384
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:34,720
..then it shouId have hit on the
back side, but not on the face.

1385
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:36,800
And why were you there
in that room? - ActuaIIy..

1386
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:39,760
I went for the tooIkit of the car.
- TooIkit?

1387
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:41,640
That shouId be in the car.
Why was it in the storeroom?

1388
01:56:41,720 --> 01:56:43,840
That tooIkit is missing. So
I went for the spare tooIkit.

1389
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,160
Is it there?

1390
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:49,600
Is the tooIkit there?
- No, it isn't there.

1391
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,920
Let's go and check.

1392
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:17,400
This is the hand which
saved father-in-Iaw..

1393
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,800
..when he got the current shock.

1394
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,440
This is the hand which saved
mother-in-Iaw from death..

1395
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,880
..when she was faIIing in the Iift.

1396
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:34,400
How dare you to misbehave
with their daughter-in-Iaw..

1397
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:37,840
..even after being their servant!

1398
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,440
TeII me. TeII me did you do this..

1399
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:44,600
Sir. Sir.

1400
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:49,440
You Ieave him, son.
RascaI, how dare you to do that!

1401
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:52,240
Sir. Sir.
- How dare you to do that!

1402
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:57,200
UncIe! Don't troubIe yourseIf.
I wiII take care of him.

1403
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:03,240
I beg you, don't beat me.
I have done a mistake.

1404
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:08,240
Madam, forgive me.
Sir, madam is a goddess.

1405
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,560
I did this mistake since I
was attracted towards madam.

1406
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:13,480
Madam, forgive me.
- Get Iost.

1407
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:20,080
UncIe, throw him out
of the job right now..

1408
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,440
..or eIse I wiII kiII him right now.

1409
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:30,240
If I see you again, I
wiII kiII you first.

1410
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,440
Forgive us.

1411
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:37,200
Take her inside.

1412
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,240
'AII the incidents that were
happening were suspicious.'

1413
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,200
'Why wouId someone try to kiII me?'

1414
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:56,040
'Not onIy on me, but
such kind of attempts..'

1415
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:59,240
'..were aIso being
done on Meenakshi.'

1416
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:04,040
'When I think about the
insuIt that have been done..'

1417
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:06,440
'..to Meenakshi, my bIood
starts burning with anger.'

1418
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,760
Meena. What is your
opinion on your in-Iaws?

1419
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,520
Hey, God wiII punish
you if you doubt them.

1420
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:28,400
And haven't you seen
how they Iook after me?

1421
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:31,200
That's what I am
unabIe to understand.

1422
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,400
When I see them, they
appear Iike Gods as you said.

1423
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:37,400
But the incidents that are
happening are suspicious.

1424
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,440
And aIso Uday is
going to America now.

1425
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:43,040
I was wondering that
it's been a whiIe since..

1426
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:44,520
..you haven't fought with someone.

1427
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,200
Hey, pIease Iet me Iive with peace.

1428
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:53,560
Both of them are treat me
Iike their own daughter.

1429
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:59,160
In fact when I am with them,
I never miss you peopIe.

1430
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:00,520
They are Gods.

1431
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:09,000
This hasn't been done by our Gods..

1432
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,200
..but it has been done
by your God. Look there.

1433
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:29,320
Uday, the fIight from Bombay is at

1434
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,160
WiII you give me a
caII before departing?

1435
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:35,160
Ok, I wiII not get on the fIight
before taking your permission.

1436
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:37,520
And keep this passport safeIy.
- Ok.

1437
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,360
Uday, I am not happy
with you going at this time.

1438
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:43,360
What do you mean by this time?

1439
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:48,160
The incidents that are
happening consecutiveIy.

1440
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:50,160
I don't want Meena
to Iive be here aIone.

1441
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:53,200
It's not for too Iong,
just six months.

1442
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,400
Anyway, she is coming to your
home to deIivery next month.

1443
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:57,160
If you wish she wiII stay
there for coupIe of months more.

1444
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:58,400
What do you say, Meena?

1445
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:01,000
You are right. Meena
wiII come to our home..

1446
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,720
..next month anyway. Can I
take here there tomorrow?

1447
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,480
You can take her if she
doesn't have any probIem.

1448
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:06,960
What are you saying! You
are asking him to take..

1449
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:09,160
..daughter-in-Iaw tomorrow?
Let her stay here..

1450
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:11,120
..for some more days. It's
not auspicious to send her..

1451
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:13,160
..during the eight month. We
wiII send her in the beginning..

1452
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:14,760
..of the ninth month
as per the tradition.

1453
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:17,120
No, mother-in-Iaw. I wiII
take Meenakshi with me tomorrow.

1454
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:20,960
Hey, they are eIders. They
know what is right and..

1455
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:23,160
..what is wrong.
- You keep quiet. I am asking them.

1456
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:25,160
I can understand you
sibIings' sentiment.

1457
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,360
And mother is aIso right.
She wiII come there next month.

1458
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:31,320
Swami, bring the Iuggage down.
- Ok, madam.

1459
02:01:37,480 --> 02:01:40,360
Uday, I toId you, either you go Ia
ter or I wiII take her with me.

1460
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:43,120
What's this, son ! Why are you
taIking Iike that at this time!

1461
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:45,720
That's what I am aIso saying.
What's this at this time!

1462
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:47,960
What's this fooIishness!
How can be so scared..

1463
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:49,680
..at some things which
happened accidentaIIy.

1464
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:54,360
Even I can't understand it. I
feeI Iike something is going on.

1465
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:57,480
Why are you taIking as if I am
Ieaving you sister intentionaIIy!

1466
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,440
Aren't my mother
and father with her?

1467
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:00,720
What eIse can
better safety than this?

1468
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:04,080
I can't trust anyone right now.

1469
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:10,960
What did you say! How
can you doubt my parents..

1470
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:12,440
..who treat her as
their own daughter!

1471
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:16,400
I am not doubting them, but
the circumstances are such..

1472
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,400
What rubbish !
- Uday. Uday.

1473
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,440
He is apprehensive
since she is her sister.

1474
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:23,440
He is taIking as if
we are her enemies.

1475
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:25,480
What rubbish are you taIking!

1476
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,120
I am not your sister anymore.
You be within your Iimits.

1477
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:30,120
You just wait. I am taIking to them.

1478
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:33,920
Listen to me, Uday. AII the
incidents that have happened..

1479
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,120
..are suspicious. How
can the car brakes faiIed..

1480
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:40,120
How can
mother-in-Iaw faII in the Iift!

1481
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:42,120
How can the motor go
wrong when switched on !

1482
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:46,320
How can that driver
misbehave with the pregnant woman !

1483
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,680
Do you have an answer
to anyone one these?

1484
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,440
So you want to say that my
parents are behind aII these?

1485
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,440
That's not the thing,
brother-in-Iaw!

1486
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,120
Don't caII me brother-in-Iaw.
Get out of here.

1487
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:59,360
How dare you to speak about
us Iike that in our own house!

1488
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,680
First get out. Get out of our house.

1489
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:13,320
Get out.

1490
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,280
If I hurt you, then I am sorry.

1491
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:25,120
I am teIIing you again, Meena
isn't safe here without you.

1492
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:29,080
Won't you Iet me Iive with peace?

1493
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:33,320
You get out of here first.
Get out. They are Gods.

1494
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:36,240
If you doubt them, then
you wiII be insuIting me.

1495
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:40,080
You don't know anything. You
keep quiet. - You shut up.

1496
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:42,080
You get out of here.
- Meenakshi, I am taIking to him.

1497
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:45,080
You get out.
- Meena! Listen to me.

1498
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:50,440
Get out of here.
- Meena! Listen to me.

1499
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:55,280
Listen to me, Meena.
- You go away.

1500
02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:58,040
Meena, Iisten to me. Meena.

1501
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:07,400
Get Iost. Father-in-Iaw, he
doesn't know about you weII.

1502
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:12,640
I am apoIogizing to you on
his behaIf. PIease forgive him.

1503
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,920
He can't be forgiven.
If he comes here again..

1504
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,080
..or you go there, both
of us wiII have to suffer.

1505
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:21,080
Uday, Uday, don't speak Iike that.

1506
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:23,080
He is behaving so
because of his anger.

1507
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:28,640
Your wife wiII Iive
happiIy as many days God wants.

1508
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,080
Take her inside. You go inside.

1509
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,200
Hey, go you to work. Do your work.

1510
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:33,880
You asked me kiss.
Is that sufficient..

1511
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:36,040
..or do you want more?
We can't stop with a kiss.

1512
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:39,600
So take me away with you?
- Where?

1513
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:42,600
Let's run away.
- What's the need to run away?

1514
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:45,200
Or eIse my father wiII
kiII me if teII him about you.

1515
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:47,560
Are you so scared of your father?
- Very much.

1516
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,360
But I don't Iike the
girIs who are get so afraid.

1517
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:56,280
Hey, is the Tiffin box ready? I a
m getting Iate to office.

1518
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,040
Here it is.
- Give it, fast.

1519
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,040
Hey, have you bunked the schooI?
- I am going.

1520
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:03,200
Father, your fiIes.
- Why don't you give them to me?

1521
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:06,600
Everyone just gives direction.
- Father-in-Iaw, your gIasses.

1522
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:10,600
Give it to me. O God.
I am getting Iate.

1523
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:15,040
Father, don't go to office today.
I need to taIk to you.

1524
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:19,600
Is that so urgent? Today is
Sunday. Let's taIk tomorrow.

1525
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:22,000
It isn't possibIe. I need
to taIk to you right now.

1526
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,200
Come.

1527
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:35,600
TeII me what it is.
- You first take these BP tabIets.

1528
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:37,200
I wiII teII you after that.

1529
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:46,200
Now teII me.
- I Iove a person.

1530
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:49,240
Water.

1531
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:56,040
We met in Hyderabad. He
finished his engineering.

1532
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:59,560
He is a very good-Iooking guy.
He is a straightforward guy.

1533
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:05,240
I Iike him a Iot. I
want to marry him.

1534
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:08,240
Geeta.

1535
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:13,200
Geeta, come with me.

1536
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,840
No one can stop my Iove.
Nothing eIse in this worId..

1537
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:19,320
..has as much power
as the true Iove has.

1538
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,800
Break the shackIes of this
crueI men and crueI society..

1539
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,000
..and come to me. For you, for
you Iove, I am ready to take..

1540
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:28,200
..anyone's Iife and even
to sacrifice my Iife, Geeta.

1541
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,240
These eIders wiII
never understand our Iove.

1542
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,200
Come, Geeta. Come.

1543
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,960
Throw this dust in the dustbin.

1544
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:02,800
What eIse can be
better than a son-in-Iaw..

1545
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:06,560
..who has made my daughter
so courageous! Where is he?

1546
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:25,200
KiII him.

1547
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:19,120
How many times do I've to
teII you not to come to my home!

1548
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:20,720
I was about to go to the graveyard..

1549
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:22,240
..but IuckiIy I came to your home.

1550
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:25,120
What happened? Didn't you
kiII him? Where is Mani?

1551
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:27,760
Mani! He got beaten up. He
won't get weII for a coupIe..

1552
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:30,880
..coupIe of months. We are not
sure if he wiII ever get weII.

1553
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,480
Sir, he is not an ordinary
person. He is Iike a demon.

1554
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:35,920
We were ten peopIe
and he was just one.

1555
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:37,240
Look over there.

1556
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:56,920
Look, there. How your
brother is defaming us!

1557
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,880
Ours is a famiIy who cares for
reputation more than our Iives.

1558
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:04,120
What's this! Have you gone mad?

1559
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,880
Won't you Iet me Iive with peace?

1560
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,880
I am doing aII this for your sake.

1561
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,280
I won't go tiII you
come to our house.

1562
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:16,440
Don't troubIe me Iike
this. This is my house.

1563
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:19,720
I am very happy here.
PIease don't defame us..

1564
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,440
..due to your assumptions.
- No, Meena.

1565
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:25,880
There is no doubt. They are
trying to kiII both you and me.

1566
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:28,880
Just now ten
rowdies came to kiII me.

1567
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,720
AII these days I thought
that he is chasing me..

1568
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:34,120
..since I have beaten him Hyderabad.

1569
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:37,080
But he came to
Hyderabad from here to kiII me.

1570
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:39,440
He tried to kiII me in
the pond a few days ago.

1571
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,880
You don't stay here even for
a second. They wiII kiII you.

1572
02:11:43,960 --> 02:11:46,400
They wiII kiII you, Meena.
- Now stop it.

1573
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:49,080
God wiII punish you.
- You see what truth is.

1574
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:53,880
Look into your father-in-Iaw's
eyes. He is a bIack cobra.

1575
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:55,840
Look at your mother-in-Iaw.

1576
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:58,880
She isn't a Iady,
but she is an animaI.

1577
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,080
The peopIe of Madhurai don't
know about their reaI seIf.

1578
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,080
Boy, what happened to you !
What are you saying!

1579
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:09,680
This is not you. It
seems that some eviI eye..

1580
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:11,120
..has cast a speII on you. You
come inside. Let's taIk there.

1581
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:13,120
Bring some water.
- Hey, bring some water.

1582
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:14,880
Don't misunderstand your brother.

1583
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:17,880
We'II offer prayers to Mother.
Everything wiII be aIright.

1584
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,040
Hey, bring some water. - This may
be due to some eviI spirit.

1585
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:23,040
You come inside, son-in-Iaw.
- Now stop it.

1586
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:25,200
What's this!
- You come here, daughter-in-Iaw.

1587
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:26,440
Stop this act.

1588
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:29,880
You are the one who
took out the car brakes.

1589
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,880
You are the one who
made the Iift faII.

1590
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:33,200
You are the one who
organized that motor-mishap.

1591
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:36,040
And you are behind
even that driver's act.

1592
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:40,560
Hey, Naikar, it isn't
manIy to stab from behind.

1593
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:44,520
If you have guts, then
remove your mask and fight me.

1594
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:51,360
Hey, you get Iost from here. Fath
er-in-Iaw, forgive me.

1595
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:54,160
I can't controI him anymore.
PIease caII the poIice..

1596
02:12:54,240 --> 02:13:01,560
..and ask them to drag
him away. Ask him to go.

1597
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:05,320
You don't worry, Meenakshi.

1598
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:08,120
Even the God can't remove from here.

1599
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:13,120
I won't Iet anyone
harm you tiII I am aIive.

1600
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:19,440
ShaII we caII the poIice?
- No.

1601
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:21,760
Look, how he is shouting
about the murder we've done.

1602
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,400
CaIIing poIice wouId
be harmfuI to us onIy.

1603
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:25,800
Hey, Naikar.

1604
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:29,720
Mother Meenakshi is
there is protect Madhuri.

1605
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:33,440
And I am there to
protect my Meenakshi.

1606
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:48,960
Look. Those twins
shouId die at once.

1607
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:53,240
After Mother's worship
he shouId die outside..

1608
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,960
..when she wiII die inside.
And bury him safeIy.

1609
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:57,680
Now get Iost.

1610
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:05,440
Rupa toId me about you
and now I saw you myseIf.

1611
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:10,000
I am your friend in your sorrows.

1612
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:14,240
I can understand how much
you wouId care for your wife..

1613
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:16,840
..when you care so
much about your sister.

1614
02:14:18,680 --> 02:14:20,280
Son, I wish that before the
Mother's worship is over..

1615
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:22,720
..aII your sister's
troubIes shouId vanish.

1616
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:27,640
This is the first time my
father taIked so sIowIy.

1617
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:30,400
Now even I got a Iot of courage.

1618
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:34,400
TeII me what I shaII
do for your sister.

1619
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:31,720
''The girI's marriage is great.''

1620
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:40,720
''Lord Shiva's marriage is great.''

1621
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:54,600
''There is Mother
Meenakshi for aII of us.''

1622
02:15:55,720 --> 02:16:04,400
''Take care of my sister,

''Come to us, dear..''

1633

''We are waiting for you here.''

1634
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:43,160
''I danced a Iot..''

1635
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:49,520
''..so that I won't faII sIeep.''

1636
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,160
''It's happening in the tempIe..''

1637
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:54,880
''..and there is a
storm in the heart.''

1638

''..then who can harm you !''

1643
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:13,280
''You are my dear sister.''

1644
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:18,640
''I can fight even with
the Gods for your weIfare.''

1645
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,520

Everyone, come here.
- Meena! Run away.

1658
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:52,400
Stop her.

1659
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:00,560
Meena! Run.

Meena..

Catch her, BaIa.

1665
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:42,600
Meena.

1666
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:53,200
Meenakshi.

1667
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:06,160
Meena.

1668
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:23,200
BIess us, Goddess.

Go and find her.
- Find her out.

1671
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:52,520
Mother Meenakshi, protect us.

1672
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:22,400
Meena.

1673
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:26,520
Meenakshi.

1674
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:32,360
Mother Meenakshi, protect us.

1675
02:25:03,480 --> 02:25:04,520
Meena.

1676
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:12,120
Muttuswami, Hey, come here.
- Yes, sir.

1677
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:14,120
There is no use in
finding them Iike this.

1678
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:16,280
Keep our men at aII
the four main doors.

1679
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:18,960
Within sometime everyone
wiII go out aIong with..

1680
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:21,720
..Mother's idoI. They wiII
aIso try to escape then.

1681
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:24,360
FoIIow them if you see them.
What do you say, dear!

1682
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:26,360
And if you don't see them,
that means they are hiding here.

1683
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:29,440
Then cIose aII the four
doors. Now go. - Ok, sir.

1684
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:32,120
Dear, they can't escape.

1685
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:55,120
Did you find them?
- We didn't see them, sir.

1686
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:56,480
And you?
- No, sir.

1687
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:58,440
That means they are
hiding somewhere here.

1688
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,280
Go and search them.

1689
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:02,320
Muttuswami, go and find them.
- Go there.

1690
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:45,280
What happened!

1691
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:58,240
BaIa.

1692
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:11,240
Mother-in-Iaw, Ieave me.

1693
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:15,560
Father-in-Iaw, I am a
pregnant Iady. Have mercy on me.

1694
02:30:16,280 --> 02:30:19,240
You twins you betrayed us.
It's a matter of 1000 crores.

1695
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:23,560
It's not 1000 crores,
BaIa, its 1001 crores.

1696
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:28,000
We must kiII you for
keeping us away from 1001 crores.

1697
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:32,200
I wiII kiII you. I wiII kiII you.

1698
02:31:10,280 --> 02:31:11,280
Sir.

1699
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:14,320
Hey, go and kiII
them first. KiII them.

1700
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:16,320
Go there. Go there.

1701
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:19,200
Are you fine?

1702
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:26,160
It seems that her
pain has increased.

1703
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:27,280
Let's take her to the hospitaI.

1704
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:29,000
No, they won't Iet us Iive here.

1705
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:31,160
Hey, you take me away from here.

1706
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:33,240
There is a raiIway station
outside this city, isn't there?

1707
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:36,240
I am taking her there. You
come with me. - Be carefuI.

1708
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:14,280
Where are they?
- We couIdn't see her.

1709
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:15,960
We searched everywhere.

1710
02:32:19,880 --> 02:32:21,200
Hey, they are here.

1711
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:44,160
Meena.

1712
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:23,280
Come fast.

1713
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:24,160
Brother.

1714
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:31,080
Brother.
- Meena.

1715
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:56,160
Meena.
- O God! I can't bear this pain.

1716
02:36:58,120 --> 02:37:01,840
I have put my
brother's Iife aIso in danger.

1717
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:04,000
You don't worry.

1718
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:06,960
I wiII save you even if I
need to sacrifice my Iife.

1719
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:37,120
Meena.

1720
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:29,720
Hey, get up.

1721
02:41:29,800 --> 02:41:32,280
Hey, where has he hidden her?

1722
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:51,720
BaIa, kiII him.

1723
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:51,200
'As Meenakshi said,
God sees everything.'

1724
02:44:52,880 --> 02:44:54,840
'One who digs a hoIe,
faIIs in it someday or other.'

1725
02:44:55,960 --> 02:45:04,040
'Naikar's wife became
paraIyzed on watching..'

1726
02:45:04,160 --> 02:45:05,920
'..Naikar's brutaI death.'

1727
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:11,640
'Not one or two, but we grew
with together for 22 years..'

1728
02:45:11,800 --> 02:45:15,440
'How dare are they to kiII her!'

1729
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:21,120
'I guess many of you might
be feeIing the same way.'

1730
02:45:21,240 --> 02:45:26,400
'Since it is bIood reIation.'

1731
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:30,880
'I didn't teII you
my name. It's Arjun.'

1732
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:33,840
'My name is Arjun.'
