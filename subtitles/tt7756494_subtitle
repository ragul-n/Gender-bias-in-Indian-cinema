Where is my son?
Dad!

00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:03,795
Nurse!

00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:07,378
Dad! Dad!

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,837
Doctor!

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,753
Nurse!

14
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,962
Where is my baby?

15
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,465
The minister had a 'darshan' of Mother
Goddess and he is on for the station.

16
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:25,962
The security is all alert, right?
- It's all alert, sir.

17
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:30,921
Mohan...
- Sir.

18
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:32,592
Send the passengers from the other side.

00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:34,755
Minister will be coming through
the main gate. - Sir.

20
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,422
If you find someone suspicious,
check them.

21
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:37,630
Yes, Sir.
- Be alert.

22
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:38,422
Sir.

23
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:00,880
Where are you from?

24
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,130
Visakhapatnam.

25
00:03:02,213 --> 00:03:05,380
What are you hiding there?
Bombs? Drugs?

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,963
Or weapons? Open it.

27
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,588
Open it!

28
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:14,797
Whose baby is this?

29
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:15,880
My baby.

30
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:17,838
Where is his mother?
- She is not here.

31
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,880
Not here? You left her?

32
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:21,963
Killed her?

33
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:27,838
Is he your own child?
Or did you abduct him?

34
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,588
You look weird. Constable!

35
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:32,505
Sir.

36
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,713
Bring him to the station.

37
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:38,213
Let us place the baby in an
orphanage and enquire.

38
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,088
Give the baby here.

39
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,088
I said give.

40
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:47,047
He is not an orphan.
I am his father...

41
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:49,630
Time and life are both very valuable.

42
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:51,880
Mind your business. Go!

43
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:54,713
How dare you touch a policeman!
- Sir! Minister is here.

44
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:58,297
Sir!

45
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,422
Narasimha! What are you doing here?

46
00:04:03,422 --> 00:04:05,425
Do you have any problem?
- No, Sir.

47
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:07,755
Just talking to an old friend.
- Oh...

48
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,755
Oh! wow...you have a lion for your son.

49
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:12,463
He takes after you...

50
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:13,755
Sir.

51
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,755
I'm getting late for the train. See you.

52
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:20,005
What is it darling?

53
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:21,838
Sleeping?

54
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,463
Sorry, Sir.

55
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:27,463
I misunderstood you. I am sorry.

56
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:31,463
The courtesy you show to politicians,
give some to public too.

57
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:39,755
Yes, sweetheart.

58
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,338
Dear, look there.

59
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,963
No, Sir. I don't want this job.
- But why?

60
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:26,047
The boy is not able to take all
those sounds, noise and all.

61
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,213
Ok, take the money.
No, sir. I'll leave.

62
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:10,713
Save me!

63
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:16,713
Save me, Sir.
That is a kidnapping gang, Sir.

64
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,380
They are after me to kill as
I complained to the police, Sir.

65
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,963
Please, Sir.
Save me.

66
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,297
Sir... please!

67
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,842
Hey, stop!

68
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,550
Here, take the key.
- Why are you leaving this place, sir?

69
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,255
How can I stay here amidst
all these conditions?

70
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:49,175
See you.

71
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:51,304
Take good care of the boy, sir.

72
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,422
Hey! Cheers!

73
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:58,005
Hey, Kumar! The bachelor party must rock.
- Ok, bro.

74
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:00,047
Drink dear, drink...

75
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:02,592
Hey, look at this girl's photograph. Good?
- Who is she?

76
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:04,422
Hey... don't look there.
- Amazing!!

77
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,050
Hey! What is this man?
What is this disturbance?

78
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,425
Is this a bus or a bar?

79
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:10,963
Can't we sleep at all?
I will call the police.

80
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,422
Do it... do it...

81
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,380
Shut up and sit, old fellow.
Your age is barred.

82
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,005
You neither are fit for bar nor war.
Sit down!

83
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:25,547
Brother!
- Hmmm?

84
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:27,713
The child is crying,
have your drinks quietly.

85
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,297
Give him milk. He will sleep.

86
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,922
If you stay quiet, he will have
his milk and sleep.

87
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:34,008
Give this beer,
He will sleep till the morning.

88
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:34,967
Super idea, bro!

89
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:36,838
You talk strange... making fun...

90
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:40,172
What is this?

91
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,838
I don't want... Don't!
- Drink dear... Drink...

92
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:43,467
Drink, drink, drink...

93
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:44,883
Drink, drink, drink...
- What is this?

94
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:45,675
Drink dear...

95
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,713
This will give you a better kick
than your mom's milk. - What is this?

96
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:49,755
Drink a little. Just a little. A little...
- No!

97
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,168
You sir, madam.

98
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,310
Aunty, you are sitting on the way.

99
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,400
Oh God! I'm getting
the sacrament, move.

100
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,555
Do you have sense?

101
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,824
This sacred sacrament got spoilt
because your child touched this.

102
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:11,004
What are you saying, Priest?
I don't get it.

103
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:11,841
Telugu?

104
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:14,092
You are as tall as a tree.
Don't you know the custom?

105
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:15,672
Don't you know the temple
tradition?

106
00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:17,717
The offering became impure
with your child's touch.

107
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:19,422
How will I present this offering
to the Lord?

108
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:21,505
Go away. Go.
- Wait.

109
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:22,672
Please wait.

110
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,505
What did you say pundit?

111
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:25,922
The child's touch makes
the offering impure?

112
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,588
t is written in the Vedas and the lessons
that child is the image of God.

113
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:30,588
Did you forget?

114
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:33,880
How can God make God impure?
It is Gokulashtami today.

115
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:35,925
How can you scold the child Krishna?
- Isn't it wrong?

116
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,047
Please, forgive sir.
He knows the customs

117
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:40,755
but does not understand
the treatise.

118
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:43,338
Take it. Go and begin the worship. Go.
- Ok.

119
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:44,755
Go.
- Please excuse me.

120
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,088
Son...

121
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:51,088
Govinda... Govinda!

122
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:54,547
Govinda Govinda!
- Govinda Govinda!

123
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:57,130
Govinda Govinda!

124
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:59,755
Govinda Govinda!

125
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:03,463
Devi!
- Sir!

126
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:06,297
Take the boy and dress him up
- Ok sir.

127
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:44,297
By the way, what did you
name the child?

128
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:45,755
I haven't named him, yet.

129
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,755
I call him Bujji, Kanna, Chinna.

130
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:51,130
Hey... More than a year
and you haven't named him yet?

131
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:55,963
Perumal temple, Krishnashtami...
I will christen him.

132
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,505
Balakrishna.

133
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,172
It is very meaningful, Sir.

134
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:03,088
Is it nice?
- Very nice sir.

135
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:04,588
Did you like the name?

136
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:07,797
When so many of them say it is good,
why will I refuse it sir?

137
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,130
By the way, what's your name?
- Narasimha

138
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:12,088
Where are you from?
- Vizag, sir.

139
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:14,088
How long will you be here?

140
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,088
If I find some work, I will
continue my stay here, Sir.

141
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:19,005
What sort of work?
- I will do any work I know, Sir.

142
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,172
If it is work you do not know?
- I will learn and do it, sir.

143
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:24,422
You are typical... let's go.

144
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:44,130
All Hail...
Govinda! Govinda!

145
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,883
What man? Why are you standing
in a circle and singing a wake up song?

146
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,130
To wake up God.

147
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:53,755
You were delegating ten people,
and you fell asleep Chief.

148
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,172
Who fell asleep?

149
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,463
Closed eyes means sleep?

150
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:00,963
When elders close their eyes
while talking it,

151
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:03,213
means they are in deep thoughts.

152
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:06,463
Ok. Give us work, Chief.

153
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:08,630
What work, man? what work to give?

154
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:11,380
He pushes every Telugu speaking man
into my home

155
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:12,547
like cattle in the cattle shed.

156
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:15,675
Not able to give you work,
here... here... I lost all my hair.

157
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:18,008
So, you had a lot of hair,
previously chief?

158
00:15:18,088 --> 00:15:20,630
Don't crack silly jokes.
I will break your head.

159
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:24,880
No, Sir. For the last 20 to 30 years,
you are maintaining the same figure sir.

160
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:28,130
You market hasn't gone down at all, sir.
- Work, man...

161
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:29,755
Workmanship.

162
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,717
But why do you have a heart burn
about my personality.

163
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:36,213
When he thinks of your wife,
his heart burn is all the more.

164
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:38,842
Why should he have heartburn
thinking of my wife?

165
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:40,463
Why not, sir?

166
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,922
She is like a laddoo to look at

167
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:46,338
like a flying sparrow...

168
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:49,505
Like a shining tomato...

169
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:51,463
Sharp like a...

170
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:52,505
Hey...

171
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:55,255
Hey! Why are you glowing
talking about her?

172
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:58,630
Not just me, Sir.
- So...all of you are thinking of my wife?

173
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:01,880
I will kill you if you play tricks...
- Go... go... get to work.

174
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,297
Oh no!

175
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:11,172
Please, come.

176
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:12,957
Thank you, sir.
- What for?

177
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,540
You came home today without
bringing anyone along.

178
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,835
Who is he?
- Narasimha...

179
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:19,915
Greetings, sir.

180
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,248
Say it... say it again.

181
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,710
He called me mom!

182
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,415
He is a very nice person.
- It is quite clear. I can see it.

183
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:31,460
If you get to know him,
you will like him a lot more.

184
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,707
Yes... yes...
- Hey, look at aunty.

185
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,377
Say mama... mama.
- From today, he works here.

186
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,665
He has already set the work
for himself.

187
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,085
See, dear. Devi looks like a doll.

188
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,790
There are two bedrooms
on the south-west corner, right?

189
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:44,835
Give one to Narasimha.
- How can that be possible?

190
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:47,293
We are staying there.
- You have two bedrooms, right?

191
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,210
I stay in one room and my wife
stays in another room, Sir.

192
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,752
Now we know, why our Santhanam sir
doesn't have children.

193
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:54,752
Who is that?
What is that rubbish?

194
00:16:54,832 --> 00:16:55,998
I will kill you, idiots.

195
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,707
Hey...what are you shouting?
Senseless idiot!

196
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:01,623
You grew your tummy but
not your brain.

197
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:02,915
Santhanam!

198
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:05,540
Whenever I scold you,
why do I hear claps all around?

199
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:06,502
You will hear them, Sir...

200
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:09,748
Those living in the servant quarters
clap whenever they like. - Ok, wait.

201
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:11,293
Narasimha! That's my wife.

202
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:12,418
Greetings, madam.
- Greetings.

203
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,957
Narasimha! The glamorous lady
beside you is my wife. - Come here.

204
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:16,957
She told me.

205
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:17,957
What, Devi?

206
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,665
Are you both sleeping separately?
- Oh, I cannot tolerate his snoring.

207
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,582
So, only in the nights we sleep apart.

208
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:25,585
Take good care of him.
- Ok, sir.

209
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,248
Did you understand?
- Understood sir.

210
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:29,040
You told me in Telugu, didn't you?

211
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,248
Take good care.

212
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:38,582
What work to give him?

213
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,665
Driver, Sir! Give the baby to me.

214
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:43,832
Come, come, come, come.

215
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:45,415
Driver, Sir!

216
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,082
You already fixed that way?
- Yes, Sir.

217
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:49,877
Sir has fixed it.
- Fixed?

218
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:50,623
Yes, sir.

219
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:51,665
Wait.

220
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:54,040
Come here.

221
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,290
Stand here.

222
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,415
What did you study?
- Fifth class, Sir.

223
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:01,748
That's it. That's it.

224
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,707
Remember one thing.

225
00:18:03,936 --> 00:18:08,373
If you act proud because you are
more educated than the others

226
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:10,793
I will suspend you on the spot. That's it.
- For Class 5?

227
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,415
Because it is Class 5.

228
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,373
Go.

229
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,040
Brother! New ASP.

230
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,710
I will talk to him. You stay here.

231
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,748
Ok, brother.

232
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:43,915
Greetings, sir.

233
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,127
Greetings, Shanmugham.
- Greetings, brother!

234
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:48,293
I have to meet ASP...

235
00:18:48,373 --> 00:18:49,873
You be seated, brother.
I will inform him.

236
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:50,707
Ok.

237
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:53,165
Greetings, Sir.
- What Annamalai?

238
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,252
I have something important to talk
to you about, sir.

239
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:56,040
Why?

240
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,707
Aren't the packages sufficient?
- Not about that, sir.

241
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:02,540
When my daughter is going to college,
your younger brother is ragging her.

242
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:03,918
Is it so?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,123
At this age, you need a girl.

244
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,540
So he might be attracted.

245
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:11,207
He hardly will keep her permanently!
- Sir!

246
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:14,915
Sir! She is my only daughter,
please advise your brother, Sir.

247
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:17,790
It's more dangerous to tell him.
He is an obstinate fellow.

248
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:18,502
Leave it.

249
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:19,957
What, Jayaram?

250
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,710
What is the character of
this new ASP?

251
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,378
They say he is very strict, sir.
- Oh...

252
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,957
Sir! ASP asked you to come in.
- Greetings sir.

253
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,623
How are you, sir?

254
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:30,835
Whenever a new person enters
the village,

255
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:32,290
I always...
- What is the matter?

256
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,790
You are very sharp, sir.

257
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:35,540
You come directly to the point.

258
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,623
Ok, sir.

259
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:38,540
I am...
- Kanniyappan.

260
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:41,498
But in every business of yours
there is corruption.

261
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:43,707
Who told you, sir?
- I was going through your file.

262
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:45,123
Sit down.

263
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:48,915
30 buses run round the district.

264
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,123
30 trucks transport sand.

265
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:53,582
30 lodges around
Kumbhakonam temple.

266
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,248
Many more businesses.

267
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,707
From the footwear contract
in this temple

268
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:59,918
To the district road contract...
Many like this...

269
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,127
What is this? Why 30, 30, 30
in everything?

270
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:03,915
That is my brother's birth date, sir.

271
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,332
I started all the businesses
in his name.

272
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:09,165
It's because of him that
luck favoured me.

273
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,627
My brother is my life, sir.

274
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:14,873
You came here to request
not to take out that life? - Yes, sir.

275
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,165
I'm here, for the same.

276
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,415
I heard you are an encounter specialist.

277
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:19,832
From Andhra...

278
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:22,248
Clearing the weed in Gujarat

279
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,498
and Bihar you came here
on deputation.

280
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:27,207
All the cases filed against
my brother are false, sir.

281
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,585
He did not commit 6 or 7 murders
as you think.

282
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:32,290
How much did you bring?
- You are very sharp, sir.

283
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,207
There are 30 lakhs in the vehicle.

284
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:36,873
The balance... just tell me
how much, when and where.

285
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:38,498
In 30 minutes, it will be there.

286
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,623
Brother.. ok, ok..

287
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,623
Sir, brother's phone.

288
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:46,165
Brother...

289
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,290
What, Pandey... Do you only take drugs
or make them too?

290
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,960
Hey! Sir is very sharp. Don't fear.

291
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,082
ASP is our relation.

292
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:02,582
See you, sir.
- See you.

293
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,248
Sir... One selfie with you, sir.

294
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,040
Hmmm.

295
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:15,748
Kanniyappan!

296
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:19,623
What you bought is your brother's life.
Not my power.

297
00:21:19,873 --> 00:21:23,123
If you are a macho for this town,
I am the lion.

298
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,457
No matter how much you give,
you cannot be a police.

299
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:27,252
No matter how much I take,
I won't become a rowdy.

300
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:29,210
If you take advantage of
my friendliness and touch me.

301
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,123
You will be gone. Out!

302
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,373
If you are a sharp current,
I am a heavy transformer, sir.

303
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:40,707
Only when the two join,
the power will be strong.

304
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:42,165
See you sir!

305
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:45,748
Some balance left, sir.
I owe it to you.

306
00:21:56,562 --> 00:21:57,303
Get up..

307
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,717
Hey, go away. You slept all this while.

308
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:03,005
Now you are waking me up
I am not...idiot...Madam is here.

309
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:10,592
Is the baby asleep, Driver Sir?

310
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:12,130
He is sleeping.

311
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:15,172
What is that noise?
- I will come back and tell you. Wait.

312
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:18,047
Dear...

313
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:19,339
Dear...

314
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:21,630
Please get up.

315
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,797
Where is my powder?
- It's here.

316
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,092
Please, come out.
- Where is my powder?

317
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:28,130
Step out...

318
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,467
Slowly. Slowly.
- Where is my powder?

319
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:34,842
She has been on powder milk since birth
so she keeps asking for powder.

320
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:36,422
Correct..

321
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:38,797
Come on...

322
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:43,047
Bro... get me a peg...

323
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:47,047
Bro... get me a peg

324
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:49,214
Madam!
- She fell down!

325
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:53,047
Bro... get me some powder
- Take care. Hold her.

326
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,880
This has become a habit. crap.

327
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:59,297
Move... let's go...

328
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:02,172
Bro...get some powder.

329
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:05,172
Get some powder

330
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,217
The devil born to the angel
of this house.

331
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:10,255
She studied abroad and is working there.
Came here on vacation.

332
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,967
She is on drugs and all.

333
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:14,505
But doesn't Sir know about this?

334
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,422
He does. But she is a
long awaited child.

335
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:18,922
He cannot ask, cannot stop.

336
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:21,339
She sleeps in the night
and doesn't wake up in the day.

337
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,005
Because of her he has
no peace of mind.

338
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,630
What secrets are you whispering?
- Nothing, husband.

339
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:32,217
I am telling him about the girl.
- What do you have to say about her?

340
00:23:32,297 --> 00:23:35,217
The whole village knows about it.
- He wants to work as the girl's driver.

341
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:35,880
Hello..

342
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:39,922
Whose car you should drive
would not be decided by you.

343
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:42,380
I will tell you. Go and sleep.

344
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,422
Where are we going, chief?
should first check your driving.

345
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:51,547
After that I will tell you where to go
and whose vehicle to drive.

346
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:52,630
Drive...drive...

347
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:56,172
Hey, Narasimha!
- Yes.

348
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:58,630
Any connection between
your personality and your speed?

349
00:23:58,755 --> 00:24:01,172
See... the roads are empty
Speed up, man.

350
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:02,797
I have a lot of urgent work.

351
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:05,172
Yours is a very youthful attitude, Chief.

352
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,505
Everybody knows that except my wife.

353
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:09,130
Take right turn...

354
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,172
Left...

355
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,047
Right...

356
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:20,675
Right again.
- Chief! There is no road to the right.

357
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:23,672
I asked them to lay the road!
So they didn't! Crap!

358
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:24,755
Take left...

359
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,922
Right... Left...

360
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:28,380
Right... left...

361
00:24:28,547 --> 00:24:30,297
Left right... left right...

362
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,505
Left right... left right...

363
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,922
My God! Police officer.

364
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:43,339
Hey, are you blind?
- Sorry, Sir.

365
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,755
A lady suddenly came in the front
with a baby

366
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:47,797
And so I had to steer the car
this way.

367
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:50,547
You want to talk sitting?
- My Chief said he has to go urgently.

368
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,297
Who is your Chief?
- It's him.

369
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,755
There sir.

370
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:07,755
The one in orange shirt...
he is my Chief.

371
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:09,172
Hey! Come here!

372
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:10,672
No, no, sir. It's not me sir.

373
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,592
I don't even know him.
I only asked for a hike sir.

374
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:15,547
Arrest him.
- I should escape from here

375
00:25:15,755 --> 00:25:16,755
Arrest?

376
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:19,505
Is anybody hurt?
Did I kill someone?

377
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,172
Why arrest me, sir?

378
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:23,672
Put up the case.
I will pay the fine in the court.

379
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:25,422
You are talking with arrogance!

380
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:27,422
No, sir. I am talking fair.

381
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,339
Have you studied Law?
- No, Sir

382
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:30,672
Only a little about life.

383
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,255
If you play with the police,
your life will be overturned.

384
00:25:34,547 --> 00:25:36,755
Only with God, we should never play, Sir.

385
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:39,255
Not even with me.

386
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,922
Why will I sir?
Stopping the vehicle in 'No Parking" zone

387
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:45,300
And smoking in a public place
in police uniform...

388
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,384
Why will I play with such an ASP?

389
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,797
What did you say?

390
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:51,170
Come.

391
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:56,047
No, Sir. If you handle me,
you will become a hero in the public.

392
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:59,755
If I handle you back,
you will remain a zero in the same public.

393
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:02,922
Will you lay your hand on me? Trying
to show your power before a policeman?

394
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:05,630
If you have the guts, touch me.
Show me your power.

395
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:06,464
Show me...

396
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,422
Show me man...

397
00:26:07,547 --> 00:26:08,464
Show me!

398
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,922
Oh, lady! Take that milk bottle.

399
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,797
Thank you sir.

400
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,922
TN68 AX 3003.

401
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:39,630
That's my car number.
This is my driving license.

402
00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:41,755
Send the complaint.
I will pay the fine.

403
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,339
See you, Sir.

404
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:58,130
Six
- You play this game terrifically.

405
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:00,172
I play any game terrifically, man.

406
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,172
Your turn, man!

407
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,755
Hey..

408
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:05,922
Has he slept?
- No.

409
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:08,339
Driver sir! Join us. Let us play.

410
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:09,675
No, no. I don't know the game.

411
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,047
Let him play the game he knows.
You play first.

412
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:15,130
Hey.

413
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,130
No.

414
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,092
Narasimha!
- Yes.

415
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,547
Why don't you play with us?
- I cannot.

416
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,842
He says, he can't play
why are you sending signals?

417
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:28,422
What signals? I called him directly!
- Ok. Play.

418
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,880
Hey..

419
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:37,797
It is leaving

420
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:40,630
I have some work. I am going.
- Where?

421
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:42,630
To make the bed.
- For whom?

422
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,297
For the boy.
- After that?

423
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:47,505
After that, I will make the bed for you.
You are fond of only sleeping, right?

424
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:51,630
Careful

425
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,255
Hey! How many villains do I have?

426
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:59,047
Madam... madam is home.

427
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:04,755
Today the gate has escaped.

428
00:28:08,464 --> 00:28:09,755
Hey! Close the gate.

429
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,464
She sounded the horn today
before coming in!

430
00:28:11,544 --> 00:28:13,194
May be she couldn't get the packet!

431
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:18,505
Put the lights off.

432
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:20,755
Close the door. Close it.

433
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,842
Hey, come out.

434
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,047
Who drove the car last night?

435
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:39,547
If you tell us the truth
only he will die.

436
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:42,505
Or we will kill everyone.
Speak!

437
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,592
You run the car over our boss's
younger brother and you hide here!

438
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:50,464
If our boss steps in he will
hack you to death. Come out.

439
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,047
Hey, you are only the trustee of a temple.

440
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,672
Our brother is the law maker
for the whole of Kumbhakonam.

441
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:57,425
Madam, I am scared.
I want to go home.

442
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:58,505
All of you go in first.

443
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,047
Get inside and break the house down!

444
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:30,630
Who is that?
You are creating a ruckus at my home!

445
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:33,130
How dare you?
- Dad!

446
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:37,547
I am responsible for the accident.

447
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:44,922
I am in love with the ...

448
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:47,505
Push and pull like an...

449
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:54,005
Hey! He must be dead.

450
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:57,505
Hey! He is still breathing.

451
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,505
Hey, stop that car.
We will take him to the hospital. -Hey..

452
00:30:01,797 --> 00:30:02,630
Hey! Stop...

453
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,672
Stop.... hey... you...
you... stop. Stop!

454
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:09,384
Such a terrible thing happened
and you tell me now?

455
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:11,259
How can you be so ruined?
- Shanti!

456
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,297
What are you doing?

457
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,255
With your support she has finally
become a murderer.

458
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,384
She has ruined your honour,
prestige and everything.

459
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:20,672
Forgive me, Dad.

460
00:30:20,922 --> 00:30:23,592
I will face the punishment
for I have done.

461
00:30:23,672 --> 00:30:27,505
No, dear. You don't know them.
They are barbarous.

462
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:32,005
What they might do taking you,
I don't even dare imagine.

463
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,547
I will fall at their feet
and ask their forgiveness.

464
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:37,339
No, dad.
- Dhanya!

465
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:41,505
I swear don't step over the threshold.
Take her away.

466
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,130
What, man? Could you find out
about the culprit? - No, brother.

467
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:49,172
No one told you?

468
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:52,255
Hey, tell me the truth.

469
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,505
Who drove the car last night?

470
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,339
Come, gentleman!

471
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:01,630
There is so much commotion here
and you heard nothing?

472
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:05,130
What were you doing inside?
Arrogance of being a trustee?

473
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:08,755
Forgive me. The car...
- Was driven by me.

474
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,422
I drove the car last night.

475
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,464
Narasimha!
- Sorry, sir.

476
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,547
I took the car without your knowledge.

477
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,547
How cocky you are!

478
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:38,922
No, no. Please don't hit him.

479
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:51,880
My younger brother is my life.

480
00:31:52,422 --> 00:31:55,505
You saw blood of such a man.
I am never going to spare you.

481
00:31:57,797 --> 00:31:59,255
It was me.
- No, no.

482
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:07,339
Whatever blood my brother lost.

483
00:32:07,464 --> 00:32:09,592
He should lose double that.

484
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:11,047
Thrash him.

485
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:13,047
Don't beat him.

486
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,922
Narasimha! Narasimha!

487
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:33,172
No. Stop.

488
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:35,380
Don't beat him. Listen to me.

489
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,425
Listen to me. Don't hit him.

490
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:40,505
Please. Don't hit him. Stop.

491
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:42,172
Don't hit him

492
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,255
Hey! Only your life is spared.

493
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:55,297
If something happens to my brother
in the hospital.

494
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:57,172
You will not have that life.

495
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,172
Not even your head.

496
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:01,797
Hey! Come on.

497
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:11,130
Narasimha! Even if I had a son.

498
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,172
He wouldn't make such a sacrifice.

499
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:16,172
You saved the honour of this house
and my daughter's life.

500
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:18,172
I can never repay your debt.
- Please don't.

501
00:33:18,422 --> 00:33:21,047
I didn't want you to fall at their
feet and so I took the beating.

502
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,547
But you are now...at my feet...

503
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:26,047
Narasimha! Let's go to the hospital.

504
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:28,422
You lost a lot of blood.
Let's go. Come. Come.

505
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,422
This body could take even a heart break.

506
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:32,547
Their blows are nothing, Sir.

507
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:34,339
You carry on. Please go in.

508
00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:37,130
Oh, dearie! Why are you crying?

509
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:40,505
Dad is hurt and you are pained?

510
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,422
Nothing happened, boy.

511
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:46,172
Hey! What is this?
We are men. We shouldn't be crying.

512
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:49,047
All the broken things must be
repaired by evening.

513
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:50,464
As if the sky is falling!

514
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,842
Hey...what are you staring at?

515
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:55,130
Go and get down to work.

516
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,339
As if something is happening!

517
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,922
Must I tell you specially? Go.

518
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,797
Go and take care of your work.

519
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,047
Come.

520
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:27,505
I prayed he should be fine.

521
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:30,505
Otherwise, they will beat me to death!

522
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:36,047
Prayed for his well being..

523
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:38,339
But did not take him to
the hospital immediately.

524
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:40,630
You must be thinking.

525
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:45,130
I promised God I will not do
any wrong in future.

526
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:50,529
Hey, Visi fellow! What about you?

527
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:54,755
All are carrying sacks but
you are swaying with a small bag.

528
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,339
Madam asked me to throw
this in the waste bin, sir.

529
00:34:57,422 --> 00:35:00,630
Who is Madam?
It's me. Santhanam the Great.

530
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,047
Go. Go and carry the weights.

531
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,672
Who will throw away
sacred ash in the bin?

532
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:11,797
She has no sense.
Don't you have any brains?

533
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,505
Idiot...idiot fellow...

534
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:24,422
The shorty is eating up
some powder taking it for sacred ash.

535
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:28,922
Wow! Sacred ash in Kumbhakonam is
as tasty as the sweet offering in Palani.

536
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,505
Super!

537
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,172
He is eating like a horse.

538
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:47,880
Wow!

539
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:49,339
Super!

540
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,380
We are in heaven.

541
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:54,172
Hey, Murali!

542
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,797
Murali Krishna!

543
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,380
Hey! Who is that?

544
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,717
Who is calling me by name?
Who is that?

545
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:01,925
It's me.
- Who is that, man?

546
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:03,755
Hey, here.

547
00:36:03,922 --> 00:36:05,672
Come here man. What is that look?

548
00:36:05,755 --> 00:36:08,505
Come and stand here.
Stand! What, man!

549
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:11,547
Why do you ask who is
calling me by name?

550
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,797
Why did they give you name
in the first place?

551
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,422
Isn't it to be called out?

552
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:19,047
Did he take my daughter's drugs,
by chance?

553
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:20,797
What's wrong with you? Come inside.

554
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,134
Hey! When did you come?
We have a son?

555
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:27,425
So in heaven, if we take the packet,
you get children.

556
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:29,130
Keep quiet. Forgive him.

557
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:30,922
Sir. He must have stepped on something.
- Shut up!

558
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:33,255
Devi! I think he is out of control.

559
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:37,672
Hey! Who are you to interfere?

560
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:39,797
Keep quiet. What's wrong with him?

561
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:44,922
What, men? You work for me
and you ogle at my wife?

562
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:48,339
Did I ever lift an eye lid at your wives?

563
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:49,880
What kind of talk is that?

564
00:36:50,172 --> 00:36:51,797
Who are you, man?

565
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:53,422
Are you new here?

566
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:56,464
Did he send you?
That fellow sends one every day.

567
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,380
Go, go. No jobs here. Go.

568
00:36:58,505 --> 00:36:59,592
Husband! Come back.

569
00:36:59,672 --> 00:37:02,380
He seems to be possessed. Come!
- No Shanti! He is...

570
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,255
Hey, Murali! You have no flute
and no feather!

571
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:08,922
How will you be Murali Krishna?
- Those are my heroin packets.

572
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:11,547
I think he used them.
That's why he is behaving like this.

573
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:13,297
You come inside.

574
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:16,505
I've been calling him since morning.
He is afraid of me.

575
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,842
Come, come.
- Hey, go. Go away.

576
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:21,880
Chief! Sleep for some time.
Everything will be normal.

577
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,922
Who are you, man?

578
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,464
Oh! You are already committed!

579
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,755
You are not ordinary.

580
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:33,047
You gave my wife a son.

581
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,172
You give her also one, go.

582
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,630
Sorry..

583
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:43,630
What? Why are you coming
at high speed?

584
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:45,630
Won't you go for the duet?

585
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:49,422
Hey! Why are all standing here?

586
00:37:49,505 --> 00:37:50,755
Get to work.

587
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,755
Go. Go, go.
Take care of your own work.

588
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:54,842
What about you?
You didn't go to the hospital?

589
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:57,047
You are strange.
- You...

590
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,464
Sir...
- Husband!

591
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:01,297
They will thrash you if you go inside.
Come and sleep. Come.

592
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:53,988
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

593
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:59,312
Govinda Govinda!
- Govinda Govinda!

594
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:06,982
Hey! Where is the garland?

595
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,357
Priest! as soon as my daughter's wedding
is fixed with the MP's son.

596
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,527
I promised to garland the Lord
with these notes

597
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:16,940
Drop it in that box there.
- You are amusing.

598
00:43:17,232 --> 00:43:19,732
I don't want to put it in the box...

599
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:22,190
I promised to garland the deity myself.

600
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:23,857
Ok, give it to me.
I will put it.

601
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,232
Are you playing up?

602
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:27,693
I promised I would garland Him.
How can you do that?

603
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,232
Sir, don't misunderstand me.

604
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,773
It is improper for devotees to enter
the sanctum and touch the main deity.

605
00:43:34,065 --> 00:43:35,607
Hey! You can touch the deity...

606
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,315
But I cannot?
- Forgive me, sir.

607
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:41,065
Between the food and the mouth
there should be a hand.

608
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:42,148
In the same way...

609
00:43:42,315 --> 00:43:45,940
Between the devotee and the Divine
there has to be an expert priest.

610
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,690
Are you mad?

611
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:50,443
I am a central Minister.
I am a people's ruler.

612
00:43:50,523 --> 00:43:54,023
The one inside is the world ruler.
He rules even over you.

613
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,315
ASP! Who is this fellow?

614
00:43:56,398 --> 00:43:57,315
What is this?

615
00:43:57,398 --> 00:43:59,023
I must garland the deity.

616
00:43:59,148 --> 00:44:01,648
Keep your stupid traditions aside.
Give way.

617
00:44:03,023 --> 00:44:04,732
As long as I am alive.

618
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:07,402
I will not demean the temple practices.

619
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:09,565
Will you move aside
or shall I drag you away?

620
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:13,898
We come into God's presence
to shed our ego and temptation...

621
00:44:14,148 --> 00:44:16,398
Not to exhibit them.
- You stupid!

622
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:30,732
ASP!
- Down! Down!

623
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:35,314
Show respect to priests!
- He should apologize!

624
00:44:35,394 --> 00:44:40,787
Priests need justice!
- Give them justice!

625
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:43,868
Priests need justice!
- Give them justice!

626
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:47,058
ASP!
- Down! Down!

627
00:44:47,138 --> 00:44:50,153
ASP!
- Down! Down!

628
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:53,152
ASP!
- Down! Down!

629
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:57,396
Police injustice!
- Should end right now!

630
00:44:57,476 --> 00:44:59,517
Police injustice!
- Should end right now!

631
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:03,922
ASP!
- Should apologize to the priest!

632
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:07,398
Wait... Wait... wait!

633
00:45:08,732 --> 00:45:10,440
All of you be calm.

634
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,732
I will talk to the ASP
and solve your problem.

635
00:45:13,815 --> 00:45:15,148
Don't lose your control.

636
00:45:15,357 --> 00:45:16,190
Narasimha!

637
00:45:17,607 --> 00:45:18,815
Hey! Stop him there.

638
00:45:18,898 --> 00:45:20,857
Sir! He is the trustee of the temple.

639
00:45:21,898 --> 00:45:24,398
Sir! As long as I remember,

640
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:28,818
I never saw Brahmins being humiliated
this way or going on a demonstration.

641
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:30,857
So what?
- You have done something wrong.

642
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,398
You better apologize to them.

643
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:34,357
Never.

644
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:35,148
I won't

645
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,357
I don't know if you are aware...

646
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,607
In the hundreds of years
of daily worship here,

647
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:43,190
for the first time no temple
is open in this holy land.

648
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,190
That spells woe.

649
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:47,273
If you don't stop this,
it is a disaster for people;

650
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:48,865
for you too.

651
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:50,820
What? Are you threatening me?
- No!

652
00:45:50,987 --> 00:45:53,737
I am warning you!
- What can you warn me about?

653
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,612
Sir!

654
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,945
Charge!

655
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:25,654
Tear gas!

656
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:43,445
Water cannons!

657
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,820
Mr. ASP! What atrocity is this?

658
00:46:49,904 --> 00:46:53,154
You think they are humans or animals?
Stop it.

659
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,782
They won't mend this way.

660
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:59,695
Let one or two die.

661
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:01,695
They will run away like dogs.

662
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:10,279
Will you shoot? Whom?

663
00:47:10,737 --> 00:47:12,362
'Let all be happy.'

664
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,279
The Brahmins who bless
the country and it's people.

665
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:19,404
If you find the minister great, salute
him, give him drinks, provide him bed.

666
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:23,070
But if you try to demean the traditions,

667
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:25,570
your sins will crush you
into the abyss.

668
00:47:25,862 --> 00:47:27,945
Inner sanctum is like
a mother's womb.

669
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:31,148
It is not the seat of your ego
or his official residence.

670
00:47:31,612 --> 00:47:33,154
It is a temple worshipped by all.

671
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:36,904
Only the priest has the right
to touch the principal deity.

672
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:39,029
I'm not educated like you.

673
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,570
I only know this much.
- What?

674
00:47:41,779 --> 00:47:42,987
What is their greatness?

675
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:46,070
Anyone can perform the ritual they can.
- They cannot.

676
00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:48,362
There is a qualification for that.

677
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,820
How to perform the rites?
What is idol worship?

678
00:47:52,112 --> 00:47:54,362
How to summon the Gods
with the power of incantations?

679
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,237
How to present it to the devotee?

680
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,112
That kind of vedic and divine knowledge
only the priest would have.

681
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,404
When one is blinded by ignorance

682
00:48:09,529 --> 00:48:11,612
and blinded spiritually the one

683
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:15,779
who removes the darkness and opens
the eye of knowledge is the priest.

684
00:48:16,862 --> 00:48:19,529
To humiliate such a respectable
Brahmin is wrong.

685
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:22,070
I am not educated like you.

686
00:48:22,612 --> 00:48:23,865
I only know this much.

687
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:26,279
Washing the idol, lighting the lamp.

688
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,904
Breaking the coconut and
giving the 'aarti'...

689
00:48:29,112 --> 00:48:30,695
This is indeed a great task!

690
00:48:30,904 --> 00:48:31,737
Stop it!

691
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:34,987
English education should not
destroy Indian culture.

692
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:36,070
It's wrong.

693
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:38,737
Understand the worship of God
before you talk.

694
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:42,737
Adoration, chanting, repetition, eulogy,

695
00:48:42,904 --> 00:48:45,779
meditation, consecration, anointing,
incantation,

696
00:48:45,945 --> 00:48:47,570
seat, offering,

697
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:49,070
Sandal powder, sacred rice,

698
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:51,070
flower, incense, lamp,

699
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:53,570
oblation, offertory, libation,

700
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:55,320
summoning, welcome,

701
00:48:55,445 --> 00:48:57,570
feet cleansing, clothes, bath,

702
00:48:57,654 --> 00:48:59,279
salutation, send-off...

703
00:48:59,445 --> 00:49:00,657
These are the parts of worship.

704
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,154
What do you and your minister
know of these?

705
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,154
All that you know is to swallow
people's money

706
00:49:06,237 --> 00:49:07,654
and salute the higher ranks.

707
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,362
Except the ritualistic God worship,
these people know nothing.

708
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:15,195
Devotion is their profession.
That is their God given power.

709
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:18,865
I am not educated like you.
I know only this much.

710
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:20,904
Nonsense! All that is mere trash.

711
00:49:20,987 --> 00:49:22,779
It is not trash. It is the truth.

712
00:49:26,217 --> 00:49:27,987
Incantation is Brahmin controlled.

713
00:49:28,278 --> 00:49:29,904
God is incantation controlled.

714
00:49:30,237 --> 00:49:31,737
Only a doctor is entitled to surgery.

715
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,029
Only a priest is entitled
to temple rituals.

716
00:49:34,547 --> 00:49:37,654
The heart keeps the body alive.
The temple keeps the country alive.

717
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:40,195
You have wronged. Apologize to him.

718
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:41,532
If I don't?

719
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,404
am a stubborn man.
I am also harsh.

720
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,445
I suffer silently.

721
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:48,570
I also take lives blindly.

722
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,737
I am not educated like you.

723
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,987
I know only this much.

724
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:55,487
Apologize...do it.

725
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:57,070
Never.

726
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,445
What are you doing?
Don't shoot.

727
00:50:00,987 --> 00:50:02,070
Don't shoot. Hey!

728
00:50:02,654 --> 00:50:03,695
Apologize!

729
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,487
I have wronged.

730
00:50:12,754 --> 00:50:14,529
Please forgive me.

731
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,600
Let's go, sir.
- Son.

732
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,487
May you live long!

733
00:50:37,737 --> 00:50:38,737
See you, sir.

734
00:50:48,029 --> 00:50:49,154
Get into the vehicle, sir.

735
00:50:50,154 --> 00:50:50,987
Sir!

736
00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:53,695
Who is he?

737
00:50:54,362 --> 00:50:56,112
Someone scared for the first time!

738
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,195
What power in those eyes!

739
00:50:58,904 --> 00:51:00,487
Where did he come from?

740
00:51:06,685 --> 00:51:10,172
Few years ago in a wedding hall
in Visakhapatnam.

741
00:51:10,252 --> 00:51:13,060
For cruelly murdering seven people...

742
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:16,935
Thota Ramireddy is sentenced
to death by hanging.

743
00:51:17,102 --> 00:51:20,439
As his petition is rejected
in the Supreme Court.

744
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:23,852
He had appealed to the President.

745
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:28,894
Despite his appeal,
President had denied it.

746
00:51:28,974 --> 00:51:32,670
The date of the execution
will be intimated shortly.

747
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:35,852
Visitors came for you. Make it fast.

748
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:39,492
You made me spend a lot of money saying
we will be successful in the High Court.

749
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:43,367
For success in the Supreme Court,
you made me spend much more.

750
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,117
What is the result?

751
00:51:46,617 --> 00:51:48,700
I am not worried about money.

752
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,325
I am worried about my husband.

753
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:53,787
Make my husband live.

754
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:56,700
Except the God above,
no one can stop this.

755
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,325
You are a virtuous woman.

756
00:51:58,617 --> 00:52:03,242
Only the sacred thread in your
neck would save him.

757
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,075
God!

758
00:52:06,992 --> 00:52:09,665
Please save my husband.

759
00:52:09,745 --> 00:52:11,998
In the town of Kumbhakonam in Tamilnadu.

760
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:15,162
An unprecedented demonstration
took place today.

761
00:52:15,328 --> 00:52:21,078
To suppress the disturbance
arising from that, the ASP tried to fire

762
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:23,495
A commoner named Narasimha.

763
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:26,203
Stopped him to save people
and pointed the gun to the ASP

764
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:30,633
Making him apologize to the old priest
with a large crowd watching.

765
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:35,165
People are now considering
that commoner a superstar.

766
00:52:35,245 --> 00:52:38,995
This incident in Kumbhakonam
which is called a temple city.

767
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:41,620
Has spread to the world like fire.

768
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:44,537
Everyone seems to be discussing it.

769
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:58,883
Madam! Sir is calling you.

770
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,883
Forgive me.

771
00:53:03,883 --> 00:53:08,592
However hard I try
I am not able to save you.

772
00:53:09,484 --> 00:53:14,383
Even now, I went to the Kali
temple..

773
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:20,883
And begged her...
take my life and let my husband live.

774
00:53:20,963 --> 00:53:25,508
Don't cry, Vasantha.
I got a great wife like you.

775
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,175
That is my best luck.

776
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:34,925
Take my life and let my husband
live- which woman will ask that way?

777
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:41,175
You should be my wife
even in the next life.

778
00:53:47,356 --> 00:53:49,092
Leave her, leave.

779
00:53:56,175 --> 00:53:57,508
Leave. Leave.

780
00:53:57,891 --> 00:54:00,508
Leave her, man. Let her go.

781
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:05,425
Leave her, man. Let her go.

782
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:12,800
Sorry, Vasantha. I must kill
that Narasimham.

783
00:54:12,925 --> 00:54:18,012
If our son's soul has to rest in peace,
Narasimha must die.

784
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:19,175
Great lady!

785
00:54:19,258 --> 00:54:22,508
Just in the flow I said your
yellow thread will save his life.

786
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:23,800
It did the same.

787
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:25,845
How would her death save him, sir?

788
00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:29,925
Until this case is finalized,
his death sentence will be stalled.

789
00:54:30,217 --> 00:54:32,258
What vengeance?!

790
00:54:34,493 --> 00:54:35,703
Yes, I finished that.

791
00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:42,829
Are you feeling ticklish, my baby?

792
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,633
What is this driver sir?
You don't even know how to apply oil.

793
00:54:47,925 --> 00:54:49,883
Give it here. I will do it.

794
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:56,217
Now rub from the feet to the toes.

795
00:54:58,675 --> 00:55:00,675
Look at that smile! Naughty!

796
00:55:01,092 --> 00:55:02,178
Oh, my! Naughty laugh?

797
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:07,675
After that, massage from the feet
to the calves.

798
00:55:08,093 --> 00:55:10,092
If any aches, they will disappear.

799
00:55:10,258 --> 00:55:12,758
With a woman's touch,
it feels good!

800
00:55:13,204 --> 00:55:20,508
After that, rub the thighs and massage.

801
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,425
What is this? Are you mad?
- Not me; you are mad. Mad after lust.

802
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,550
What is this play in the bathroom?

803
00:55:39,758 --> 00:55:40,845
Not a play husband.

804
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:42,925
He doesn't even know
how to bathe the child.

805
00:55:43,092 --> 00:55:44,550
So I am teaching him.

806
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,633
Oh!

807
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:50,050
When you don't know
how to give a bath to a child.

808
00:55:50,258 --> 00:55:51,633
Why did you have one?

809
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:54,720
When you don't know how to sire children,
why to get married? -Who is that?

810
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,675
Who is that? If you have the guts,
come and speak to me in my face. Coward!

811
00:56:04,415 --> 00:56:05,743
Shall we admit the boy to a school?

812
00:56:05,823 --> 00:56:08,801
He is not even one year old!
So quickly?

813
00:56:08,926 --> 00:56:11,271
Oh! That is a school for tots.

814
00:56:11,351 --> 00:56:12,551
Is it so necessary, now?

815
00:56:13,084 --> 00:56:14,519
When I have some work,
you take care of him.

816
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:16,182
When you have some work,
I take care.

817
00:56:16,262 --> 00:56:18,682
When both of us are busy,
do you know how troubled he is?

818
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:19,682
Look...

819
00:56:24,557 --> 00:56:27,349
We don't know how to get kids
or how to parent them.

820
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,432
It seems they take good care of kids...
like a mother.

821
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:33,724
Some Telugu people have started this.

822
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:34,849
Sir!

823
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:37,432
MD will be here soon.
You are asked to wait here.

824
00:56:37,557 --> 00:56:40,307
Did you fill the admission form?
- Yes.. all papers are ready

825
00:56:40,387 --> 00:56:40,932
Ok, sir.

826
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:13,391
Anusha!

827
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:15,224
Yes, ma'am.

828
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:17,474
You said someone is here
for admission?

829
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:19,432
He was waiting here madam.

830
00:57:19,974 --> 00:57:21,932
He is ready with the application form.

831
00:57:22,307 --> 00:57:23,724
Did he come with a child?
- Yes, Sir.

832
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:26,432
He must have gone to the washroom.
It is quite common with kids.

833
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:28,170
If he comes back, ask him to sit.
I will be back.

834
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:29,057
Ok, Madam.

835
00:57:53,048 --> 00:57:54,849
Get down... get down...
- Dad!

836
00:57:57,034 --> 00:57:59,481
Why do you get angry on children?
- What if he falls down?

837
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,048
No, he won't.

838
00:58:02,752 --> 00:58:05,377
Dear! I am starting to Vizag.

839
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,210
What's so urgent Dad?

840
00:58:07,335 --> 00:58:09,377
Why don't you go after a couple of days?
- We have a school there too.

841
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:10,797
I must take care.

842
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:14,335
What's the worry here?
You alone can be a mother to a hundred.

843
00:58:14,502 --> 00:58:15,585
See you.
- Ok.

844
00:58:25,276 --> 00:58:28,151
Think of mom and each one will remember
something about her.

845
00:58:28,276 --> 00:58:30,151
Hey, Kumar! What do you remember?

846
00:58:30,234 --> 00:58:31,946
I remember the laddoos (sweets)
she makes, teacher.

847
00:58:32,026 --> 00:58:33,109
Foodie! Sit down.

848
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,196
Sumati! You tell me.
- Scale, teacher.

849
00:58:35,276 --> 00:58:36,071
You?

850
00:58:36,151 --> 00:58:36,984
Kiss teacher.

851
00:58:37,064 --> 00:58:39,484
Shh! Silence! Why are you all laughing?

852
00:58:39,859 --> 00:58:42,859
It's a kiss given by mom. Sit down.

853
00:58:42,984 --> 00:58:44,151
Gowri! You tell me.

854
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:49,401
Mom reminds me of trousers,
full hands shirt, glasses.

855
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,901
A smiling face, and a loving call.

856
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:56,401
I didn't ask you about your dad, dear.
I asked about your mom.

857
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:59,776
I don't know that word and the image,
teacher.

858
00:58:59,984 --> 00:59:01,984
I lost my mom when I was very small.

859
00:59:02,234 --> 00:59:06,609
The one to feed me, put me to sleep,
help me with studies...

860
00:59:06,734 --> 00:59:07,859
Everything is my dad.

861
00:59:07,984 --> 00:59:10,609
Not only to you,
even to us he is an idol.

862
00:59:10,734 --> 00:59:12,109
He is also the school HM right?

863
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:13,734
Sit down. Narasimha!

864
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:17,609
When I think of mom,
I remember my mom's hand, teacher.

865
00:59:17,859 --> 00:59:19,901
It's the same hand that bathes me.

866
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:22,946
It's the same hand that makes me bow
before the God.

867
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,734
It's the same hand that feeds me.

868
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:28,109
It's the same hand that
consoles me when I cry.

869
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:31,109
It's the same hand that guides me
holding mine.

870
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,359
It is also the same hand that caresses
my head and puts me to sleep.

871
00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:36,129
Super!

872
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:40,859
Friends?

873
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:44,359
Oceans and continents...all exist.

874
00:59:44,526 --> 00:59:46,946
Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning, Master!

875
00:59:47,026 --> 00:59:48,109
Sit... Sit...

876
00:59:49,234 --> 00:59:50,440
Narasimha

877
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:52,734
Go with these people.

878
00:59:52,984 --> 00:59:54,151
Why, Sir?

879
00:59:57,276 --> 00:59:58,359
Your mother passed away.

880
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,984
Narasimha! Why didn't you
come to the class?

881
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:12,859
Though your mother is gone,
she is still with you.

882
01:00:14,109 --> 01:00:19,609
If you want, close your eyes and see.
You will find her.

883
01:00:25,984 --> 01:00:28,234
Go, my son. Go to the class.

884
01:00:30,151 --> 01:00:31,196
Mom!

885
01:00:31,276 --> 01:00:32,508
Go.

886
01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:38,609
Narasimha! No, Narasimha! Listen to me.

887
01:00:39,484 --> 01:00:44,984
No...I am telling you...
Don't, don't Narasimha!

888
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,196
Why did you hit them? Why? Why?

889
01:00:48,276 --> 01:00:50,109
Tell me, why did you hit them?

890
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:53,609
All of them ganged up and
beat a handicapped junior, Master.

891
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:56,401
If they beat,
who are you to punish them?

892
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:58,734
You could have informed
the teacher or me...

893
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:00,609
See...how badly he beat them all...

894
01:01:01,026 --> 01:01:02,901
How to answer so many parents?

895
01:01:04,734 --> 01:01:05,901
Go. Out!

896
01:01:06,484 --> 01:01:07,859
Ok, Master.

897
01:01:08,984 --> 01:01:11,109
Don't waste your time on waiting for me.

898
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:13,401
I will not attend the school.

899
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:16,234
Tell me, Gowri.
- Was I wrong?

900
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:17,571
You didn't like me?

901
01:01:17,651 --> 01:01:21,109
I didn't like what you did.
But I liked you.

902
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,154
I got small information
about Narasimha, Sir.

903
01:01:41,234 --> 01:01:41,859
What is it?

904
01:01:41,984 --> 01:01:43,321
He was involved in an accident.

905
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:45,151
The victim is still in the
hospital, Sir.

906
01:01:47,526 --> 01:01:50,151
Enough. This is enough.

907
01:01:50,609 --> 01:01:52,005
Thank you.

908
01:01:53,026 --> 01:01:55,526
Darling! We must go away from here.

909
01:01:56,276 --> 01:01:58,276
It is not good to stay in this
place any more.

910
01:01:59,113 --> 01:02:00,734
Whoever I am distancing myself from,

911
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,151
God brought the same person
before me.

912
01:02:03,526 --> 01:02:04,234
We have to go.

913
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:10,776
Where will he disappear, Sir?
He cannot escape my eye.

914
01:02:11,776 --> 01:02:15,984
Kanniyappan! I am not telling you this
as a policeman but as a friend.

915
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:23,026
Give me one complaint
I will see the end of Narasimha.

916
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:28,151
Why complaint, Sir?
My brother has recovered.

917
01:02:28,901 --> 01:02:30,484
Let him get out safe and sound.

918
01:02:31,856 --> 01:02:35,359
After that, with his own hands,
I will get a grave built for him.

919
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:40,234
Why should we bother
about government.

920
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:43,359
Ok.

921
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,004
Greetings sir...
- Greetings...

922
01:03:55,484 --> 01:03:57,859
Brother! What happened?

923
01:03:57,984 --> 01:03:59,276
Hey! call the doctor...

924
01:04:03,734 --> 01:04:06,859
Come, doctor. Please check.

925
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,651
Brother! Brother!

926
01:04:16,234 --> 01:04:18,276
Brother! Brother!

927
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:27,734
Why are all the men crying
as if someone is dead?

928
01:04:28,526 --> 01:04:32,276
You became one of us
and now you want to leave us?

929
01:04:32,359 --> 01:04:34,321
Is he leaving only you?

930
01:04:34,401 --> 01:04:35,276
You stay quiet.

931
01:04:35,526 --> 01:04:36,821
Ever since he married you,
he has been quiet.

932
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:39,276
Hey! Who is that? All of you leave.

933
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:43,609
Go, go. Why should you all be here?

934
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:48,196
Hey! Hey! You are supposed to go
outside not inside.

935
01:04:48,276 --> 01:04:51,359
I wanted to inform Sir...
- Sir is not at home, Sir. He went out.

936
01:04:51,484 --> 01:04:54,234
Ok, I will inform Madam.
- Sir and Madam went out together.

937
01:04:54,609 --> 01:04:55,859
What about the young madam?

938
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:58,151
Here...if you keep saying
young madam, madam and sir,

939
01:04:58,276 --> 01:04:59,821
you will forget the main issue.
- Which one?

940
01:04:59,901 --> 01:05:01,734
The same...that you have to go out.

941
01:05:02,484 --> 01:05:04,276
Madam has taken my son inside.

942
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:05,984
I am going to pick him up.

943
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:07,151
Enough?
- Enough.

944
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:08,670
Go.

945
01:05:08,859 --> 01:05:09,484
Come fast.

946
01:05:10,109 --> 01:05:11,234
Or you will forget.

947
01:05:11,776 --> 01:05:12,693
Where are you going?

948
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:15,859
Support.
- For whom?

949
01:05:16,401 --> 01:05:18,734
The boy.
- Small boy or big boy?

950
01:05:18,984 --> 01:05:20,734
Keep quiet.
- What keep quiet?

951
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:23,151
Chinna!
- Young madam took him, sir.

952
01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:24,484
Where?
- To the market.

953
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:26,734
You are going out of town.

954
01:05:26,859 --> 01:05:29,609
She wanted to buy him clothes
and chocolates.

955
01:05:29,689 --> 01:05:30,776
Auto is ready.

956
01:05:30,859 --> 01:05:33,351
I kept all your luggage packed
and sealed in the auto.

957
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:35,438
I have even paid the driver.

958
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:37,984
Come. Don't stop anywhere until
you reach the market.

959
01:05:38,257 --> 01:05:40,507
If you do, I will smash you.

960
01:05:40,882 --> 01:05:42,802
Take care. Don't forget.

961
01:05:42,882 --> 01:05:44,257
What? What should he not forget?

962
01:05:44,382 --> 01:05:46,298
Go. Get inside.
- You go man.

963
01:05:47,757 --> 01:05:50,673
Yahoo! I have no competition now.

964
01:05:51,007 --> 01:05:53,882
I am the hero. Solo hero.

965
01:06:25,257 --> 01:06:27,632
He should feel my pain.

966
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:32,257
He should cry the way
I am crying now.

967
01:06:32,423 --> 01:06:34,632
I must kill his child.

968
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,757
I must watch him cry.

969
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:40,382
Then, we should hack him.

970
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:45,257
The whole of Kumbhakonam must see
Kanniyappa's power.

971
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:50,173
That is why the body that should be kept
in the centre of the house,

972
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,632
I placed it in the center of the road.

973
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:54,468
Hey!
- Tell me, brother.

974
01:06:54,548 --> 01:06:56,382
Get his son.

975
01:06:56,507 --> 01:06:59,007
Ok, brother. Hey! Let's go.
- Brother! Brother!

976
01:07:06,298 --> 01:07:07,257
Hey! Any sense?

977
01:07:09,507 --> 01:07:10,798
Hey! Come out.

978
01:07:11,257 --> 01:07:13,257
Where?
- Why should I tell you? Get in.

979
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:15,632
If you don't, I will shoot you.

980
01:07:19,137 --> 01:07:22,034
Where are you taking me, sir?
- To police station.

981
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,507
What did I do?
- You made an accident, remember?

982
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:29,382
Kanniyappa's brother? He is dead now.

983
01:07:29,632 --> 01:07:31,968
They said he was recovering?!
How did he die sir?

984
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:36,298
Somehow he died.
But the death is on your hands.

985
01:07:37,507 --> 01:07:40,423
You give lectures in front of the media
and make me apologize to the priests.

986
01:07:40,507 --> 01:07:42,427
You played with my prestige
in front of all, didn't you?

987
01:07:42,507 --> 01:07:44,757
I will show you now
the power of a policeman.

988
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:48,802
The goons are abducting the boy.
Stop the vehicle, Sir.

989
01:07:48,882 --> 01:07:52,132
Shut up and sit down.
- Stop the vehicle sir, stop it.

990
01:07:52,257 --> 01:07:52,945
No.

991
01:07:53,132 --> 01:07:54,382
You won't?
- Never.

992
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:11,507
Brother!

993
01:08:13,048 --> 01:08:15,257
We brought his son.

994
01:08:24,257 --> 01:08:26,132
He should be split into two.

995
01:08:26,382 --> 01:08:27,798
Throw him. Hey!

996
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,382
Nothing will happen to you darling.

997
01:08:41,173 --> 01:08:41,882
I am here.

998
01:08:47,673 --> 01:08:49,882
Hey! Beat him black and blue
and bring the boy.

999
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,002
Hey, brother!

1000
01:10:17,757 --> 01:10:20,302
Nothing. Be here without any fear.

1001
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,132
The cattle are screaming.
I will give them the fodder.

1002
01:10:23,212 --> 01:10:24,950
Kill him!

1003
01:10:28,048 --> 01:10:31,007
Play with these toys.
I will play a game with them.

1004
01:12:26,923 --> 01:12:30,132
Hey! You only know how to hit.

1005
01:12:30,632 --> 01:12:35,001
I know how to fall and how to get up
and how to fell.

1006
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:38,757
Hey! Kumbhakonam has fear for you.

1007
01:12:39,257 --> 01:12:41,132
Two states consider me their life.

1008
01:12:41,382 --> 01:12:43,343
You want to show me
your stupid rowdyism?

1009
01:12:43,423 --> 01:12:47,048
Your level is a knife's handle;
mine is a sword's sharp edge.

1010
01:12:47,173 --> 01:12:49,548
Don't take the lion's silence
for renouncement.

1011
01:12:50,257 --> 01:12:53,328
If you meddle,
it will bite off your head.

1012
01:12:54,298 --> 01:12:56,927
Touch me, no danger.

1013
01:12:57,007 --> 01:12:59,927
Touch my son, no future.

1014
01:13:00,203 --> 01:13:02,423
I will reverse the picture.

1015
01:13:03,257 --> 01:13:04,747
Rogue!

1016
01:13:11,925 --> 01:13:13,294
Brother! Greetings, brother!
- Greetings!

1017
01:13:13,564 --> 01:13:15,760
Now you people can go back to work.

1018
01:13:26,257 --> 01:13:28,507
Sweetheart! The job is done.
Shall we go?

1019
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:33,428
Let's go.

1020
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:43,382
How did my child come here?

1021
01:13:44,673 --> 01:13:50,007
I was planning to harm you but
unmindful of that, you saved my kid.

1022
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:55,257
I don't know how to thank you,
Narasimha.

1023
01:14:01,673 --> 01:14:03,673
Thank you, thank you Narasimha.

1024
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:07,257
Where is my son?
- I saw him in the same market, madam.

1025
01:14:08,173 --> 01:14:09,713
My child...son!

1026
01:14:13,513 --> 01:14:14,843
One second...

1027
01:14:14,923 --> 01:14:16,588
Gowri!

1028
01:14:28,581 --> 01:14:30,382
I hope nothing happened to you, precious?

1029
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,757
Nothing happened, Gowri.
- How many times to call you?

1030
01:14:34,048 --> 01:14:37,927
Some rowdies attacked me
and took away our son.

1031
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:40,007
I hope you are fine?
What is all this blood?

1032
01:14:40,173 --> 01:14:41,536
Forget me.

1033
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:44,132
If something happened to the baby,
I would have died.

1034
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:49,548
What is that bandage on your head?
- Nothing...nothing.

1035
01:14:50,257 --> 01:14:52,007
There, he is the one who saved our kid.

1036
01:14:53,132 --> 01:14:54,795
A very nice man.

1037
01:14:55,285 --> 01:14:56,754
His name is Narasimha.

1038
01:15:02,382 --> 01:15:05,114
I will convey my thanks to him.
- Please.

1039
01:15:28,382 --> 01:15:29,929
Thank you Mr. Narasimha!

1040
01:15:30,382 --> 01:15:34,423
You don't know a person's value and yet
you saved my kid. It is hard to believe.

1041
01:15:35,301 --> 01:15:38,048
I thought I shouldn't look at you,
I should never need to.

1042
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:40,673
Bad luck. I couldn't help it.

1043
01:15:41,507 --> 01:15:45,298
I won't even entertain the
thought of meeting you again.

1044
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,007
You shouldn't get it too.

1045
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:52,132
Actually this is not a help for me.
It is a punishment.

1046
01:15:53,188 --> 01:15:55,882
I hate to even stand before you.

1047
01:16:03,882 --> 01:16:05,198
Don't cry, darling.

1048
01:16:13,632 --> 01:16:15,923
Who is she? What are you doing here?

1049
01:16:16,132 --> 01:16:17,495
I came looking for you.

1050
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:20,257
When I was buying things
for the baby.

1051
01:16:20,423 --> 01:16:23,132
There was a lot of commotion in the
market. Sounds and people were running.

1052
01:16:23,298 --> 01:16:26,218
I went inside the temple to avoid
any danger for child.

1053
01:16:26,298 --> 01:16:27,460
Ok, come.

1054
01:16:43,148 --> 01:16:46,359
Have it. Take one each,
eat well and enjoy.

1055
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:48,064
Is it your wife's birthday, sir?

1056
01:16:48,144 --> 01:16:51,193
I am giving you a sweet and
why are you talking about my wife, man?

1057
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,109
Sorry, Chief.

1058
01:16:52,189 --> 01:16:54,023
Is your wife pregnant Chief?

1059
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,189
When you are given a laddoo (Sweet)
just eat it.

1060
01:16:57,273 --> 01:16:59,189
Why do you ask about things
not in his hands?

1061
01:16:59,269 --> 01:17:00,439
Hey! Fools!

1062
01:17:00,685 --> 01:17:06,064
To get a child we need God's blessings.

1063
01:17:06,148 --> 01:17:09,523
Really? Then pray to God
and sleep every night.

1064
01:17:09,773 --> 01:17:12,773
Children will be born automatically.
- Hey, keep the laddoo there....keep it.

1065
01:17:13,023 --> 01:17:15,898
Congrats, Chief.
- Very good.-Very good.

1066
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:18,523
What is the laddoo for, Chief?

1067
01:17:18,648 --> 01:17:21,443
I am distributing sweets
in the joy of your leaving.

1068
01:17:21,523 --> 01:17:23,398
You take one yourself.
What does it mean?

1069
01:17:23,523 --> 01:17:25,398
I've decided to stay here.

1070
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:29,023
Yay! I am so happy.
- What happiness?

1071
01:17:29,148 --> 01:17:30,484
You keep quiet.

1072
01:17:30,564 --> 01:17:33,898
Why keep quiet? Hey!
Let someone clap and I will kill him.

1073
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:37,189
By the way,
why did you want to leave the town?

1074
01:17:37,273 --> 01:17:39,734
I didn't want to interfere
in the life of a girl I like.

1075
01:17:39,814 --> 01:17:41,064
So I wanted to leave.

1076
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:44,439
Now, to protect the same girl,
I decided to stay.

1077
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:49,439
Why are you grinning and going about?
- I am very happy, husband.

1078
01:17:49,523 --> 01:17:52,023
For the first time in her life....
- Hey! Who is blabbering?

1079
01:17:52,148 --> 01:17:55,773
Why do you torment me like this?
- What harm have I done to you?

1080
01:18:17,713 --> 01:18:19,859
Watch day and night properly.
- Yes, sir.

1081
01:18:19,939 --> 01:18:22,568
Two men behind and two in the front
should always be on the watch.

1082
01:18:22,648 --> 01:18:23,193
Yes, sir.

1083
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:27,023
When madam goes out,
two PCs should accompany her wireless.

1084
01:18:27,307 --> 01:18:28,523
Understand?
- Yes, Sir.

1085
01:18:28,898 --> 01:18:30,648
Ok, carry on.
- Ok, sir.

1086
01:18:30,898 --> 01:18:32,148
Hold this in your hand.

1087
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:34,398
Gowri, where are you going?
- To my father's.

1088
01:18:34,523 --> 01:18:36,189
Why so much luggage?
How long will you stay?

1089
01:18:36,273 --> 01:18:37,898
I am going away forever.

1090
01:18:38,148 --> 01:18:39,898
What?! Gowri, what did I do?

1091
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:43,023
You killed Kaniyappa's brother.

1092
01:18:43,773 --> 01:18:45,523
With vengeance he wanted to kill my son.

1093
01:18:45,773 --> 01:18:48,523
Your sin and your mistakes have put
my child's life in danger.

1094
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:49,898
How do you know?

1095
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:52,023
There are some good people
among the police too.

1096
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:54,648
For you, money is more important
than me and my child.

1097
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:57,273
I cannot live with you.
- Gowri! Please try to understand.

1098
01:18:57,398 --> 01:18:59,439
Whatever I do it is for
our child's future.

1099
01:18:59,523 --> 01:19:00,818
Stop the nonsense.

1100
01:19:00,898 --> 01:19:02,773
For me, not money,
but my child is important.

1101
01:19:03,023 --> 01:19:04,898
I only want enough for livelihood.

1102
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:06,939
I don't want the money
earned on deception.

1103
01:19:07,223 --> 01:19:09,068
I don't want this tension riddled
life day and night.

1104
01:19:09,148 --> 01:19:10,804
Listen!

1105
01:19:11,244 --> 01:19:12,916
Don't touch me.

1106
01:19:24,939 --> 01:19:26,903
Driver! Move.

1107
01:19:36,565 --> 01:19:37,773
What happened?

1108
01:19:39,523 --> 01:19:41,273
Please kill me before you go.

1109
01:19:41,648 --> 01:19:44,648
I cannot stay a single day
without seeing our child.

1110
01:19:44,898 --> 01:19:47,398
That's why kill me and go, Gowri.

1111
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:50,773
Please....please, don't go. Please.

1112
01:19:52,023 --> 01:19:55,939
Narasimha came to the rescue
of the ASP's child,

1113
01:19:56,398 --> 01:19:58,818
thrashed all my men and
hospitalized them.

1114
01:19:58,898 --> 01:20:01,064
You are the guide for all of us
around this place.

1115
01:20:01,148 --> 01:20:02,734
We will not spare the man
who beat you.

1116
01:20:02,814 --> 01:20:06,773
We will piece him and bring him here.
Tell us, who is Narasimha?

1117
01:20:13,398 --> 01:20:14,814
I am Narasimha.

1118
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:18,898
Who will make pieces of me? Tell me.

1119
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:22,109
Will you go away silently or
will you die here?

1120
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:23,439
Decide for yourself.

1121
01:20:23,523 --> 01:20:24,734
Why did you come here?

1122
01:20:24,814 --> 01:20:26,818
Why did you try to kill the ASP's son?

1123
01:20:26,898 --> 01:20:28,564
He should know my pain.

1124
01:20:29,148 --> 01:20:34,859
Sending carbon smoke into the oxygen pipe
in the hospital he killed my brother.

1125
01:20:34,939 --> 01:20:36,023
What brother, man?

1126
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:39,148
Is he Shiva from Kumbhakonam?
Or is he Rama from the Ramayana?

1127
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:42,648
He molested girls and
killed those who stopped him.

1128
01:20:42,773 --> 01:20:45,523
The ASP killed such a rogue in a
short cut encounter.

1129
01:20:46,773 --> 01:20:49,898
If it were me,
I would hack him on the main street.

1130
01:20:50,023 --> 01:20:53,023
Hey, hey, he is my life, man!

1131
01:20:53,523 --> 01:20:56,439
Hey! Godse who killed Gandhi also
was life to his parents.

1132
01:20:56,523 --> 01:20:58,814
Just because of that,
a sinner will not become a saint.

1133
01:20:59,023 --> 01:21:02,398
Leave it there. It is good for your
health and for your group.

1134
01:21:02,564 --> 01:21:04,273
Leave it here.

1135
01:21:06,398 --> 01:21:07,359
I will not.

1136
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:13,273
Until I destroy the ASP's family,
I don't have peace.

1137
01:21:17,398 --> 01:21:20,148
Hey! You are only left with life.

1138
01:21:20,898 --> 01:21:25,068
Touch the ASP's family, you will have
neither that life nor your head.

1139
01:21:25,148 --> 01:21:27,523
You told me then. Same way.

1140
01:21:36,398 --> 01:21:37,648
Good morning, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

1141
01:21:39,064 --> 01:21:41,314
Throw this bundle at that dog's face.
- Witch Dog?

1142
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:42,773
On that Kanniyappan dog.
- Yes, sir.

1143
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,273
Why are you sitting here?

1144
01:21:44,398 --> 01:21:46,564
You seem to be in deep thoughts.
Any problem?

1145
01:21:46,648 --> 01:21:47,689
No. Nothing of that sort.

1146
01:21:47,773 --> 01:21:49,689
I'm feeding the ducks and pigeons.

1147
01:21:51,287 --> 01:21:53,939
Look at these photos
how cute the baby is.

1148
01:21:55,515 --> 01:21:57,015
Oh...a girl's get up.

1149
01:21:57,433 --> 01:21:58,556
When did you take this?

1150
01:21:58,931 --> 01:22:01,101
He doesn't have this dress at all.
- Is he cute or not?

1151
01:22:01,181 --> 01:22:01,806
So cute.

1152
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:04,056
But he is not your son.

1153
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:06,556
See this.

1154
01:22:07,806 --> 01:22:09,765
These photos are
posted on their facebook.

1155
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:17,265
When you brought the boy unseen
by them in the market that day,

1156
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:18,515
I had my own doubts.

1157
01:22:18,681 --> 01:22:20,765
Both the kids look alike. How?

1158
01:22:21,146 --> 01:22:22,515
How are you connected to them?

1159
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:25,306
If you consider me your friend, tell me.

1160
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:28,390
If you have some objection, then don't.

1161
01:22:30,431 --> 01:22:33,349
This is not a story that can be
shared to get relief.

1162
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:37,390
This has to stay with me
and die with me.

1163
01:22:37,674 --> 01:22:39,265
Sorry, sir.
- Thank you.

1164
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,960
Give MP ticket to Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- Yes, give it!

1165
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:11,039
Give MP ticket to Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- Yes, give it!

1166
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:14,126
Give MP ticket to Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- Yes, give it!

1167
01:23:14,206 --> 01:23:17,179
Give MP ticket to Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- Yes, give it!

1168
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:20,526
Vizag leader Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- May he win! May he win!

1169
01:23:20,606 --> 01:23:23,735
Vizag leader Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- May he win! May he win!

1170
01:23:23,815 --> 01:23:27,004
Vizag leader Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- May he win! May he win!

1171
01:23:27,084 --> 01:23:30,108
Vizag leader Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- May he win! May he win!

1172
01:23:30,188 --> 01:23:33,300
Vizag leader Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- May he win! May he win!

1173
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:36,569
Vizag leader Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- May he win! May he win!

1174
01:23:36,649 --> 01:23:39,535
Give MP ticket to Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- Yes, give it!

1175
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:42,726
Give MP ticket to Ravi Shankar Reddy!
- Yes, give it!

1176
01:23:42,806 --> 01:23:44,976
God! Please make sure
he doesn't get the ticket.

1177
01:23:45,056 --> 01:23:48,976
If he does, he will buy the votes
and become the MP.

1178
01:23:49,056 --> 01:23:51,056
After that, I can never become
an MP in my life.

1179
01:23:51,265 --> 01:23:52,435
Bear with it, dear.

1180
01:23:52,515 --> 01:23:54,640
It's all fine.
- We are close to the hospital.

1181
01:23:54,765 --> 01:23:57,476
Oh, oh, oh. Son!
Please hurry to the hospital.

1182
01:23:57,556 --> 01:24:00,851
The doctors said the child will live
only through surgery.

1183
01:24:00,931 --> 01:24:01,976
These are idiots, mother.

1184
01:24:02,056 --> 01:24:04,765
They are not giving the way
even to the ambulance.

1185
01:24:05,181 --> 01:24:06,435
What are you watching sir as
if it is a celebration?

1186
01:24:06,515 --> 01:24:08,181
If I don't reach the centre
in 10 minutes,

1187
01:24:08,265 --> 01:24:09,226
I cannot give the exam.

1188
01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:12,015
Please clear the traffic.
- I can understand, boy!

1189
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,556
But those who protect the country
don't seem to understand

1190
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:17,265
Hey! You...are you the traffic cop?
- Yes.

1191
01:24:17,515 --> 01:24:18,976
Why don't you do something and help us?

1192
01:24:19,056 --> 01:24:21,139
I need to catch my flight.
It's very urgent.

1193
01:24:21,773 --> 01:24:24,273
What is this Sir? The public is facing
a lot of inconvenience.

1194
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:25,818
Are you not concerned?

1195
01:24:25,898 --> 01:24:28,648
We know about the public inconvenience
and hence this protest.

1196
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:31,523
If we get the ticket,
we will definitely win.

1197
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:35,398
Then, we will do great things
for the same public.

1198
01:24:35,523 --> 01:24:36,689
Tell them a lie.

1199
01:24:36,814 --> 01:24:38,398
You don't have to be afraid of anyone.

1200
01:24:38,685 --> 01:24:42,023
Already funds have reached all out
Party leaders in Delhi.

1201
01:24:42,223 --> 01:24:44,170
If they have to deviate from the High
Command's recommendation

1202
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,193
and give you the seat.

1203
01:24:45,273 --> 01:24:47,689
They would have to show something.
That is why this protest.

1204
01:24:48,285 --> 01:24:50,384
Veera Raghava Reddy here.

1205
01:24:50,464 --> 01:24:51,318
Greetings, brother-in-law.

1206
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,935
Brother-in-law!
I got the weddings cards printed.

1207
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:57,269
That's great, brother-in-law.
- I am a Central Minister.

1208
01:24:57,644 --> 01:24:59,894
My son-in-law should at least be an MP.

1209
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:04,894
That's why I got MP printed
beside your son's name.

1210
01:25:05,019 --> 01:25:06,564
He will get the seat confirmed, right?

1211
01:25:06,644 --> 01:25:09,644
My son's seat as well as victory..
both are confirmed.

1212
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:13,416
Oh, God! How disastrous!

1213
01:25:15,435 --> 01:25:18,644
Both mother and the child are gone.

1214
01:25:20,144 --> 01:25:25,144
The mother and the baby are both dead.
A full life is nipped, oh, God!

1215
01:25:54,451 --> 01:25:55,316
Here, Narasimha!

1216
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:27,060
Finish him!

1217
01:26:50,196 --> 01:26:52,689
What is this demonstration for?
- I must become an MP.

1218
01:26:52,769 --> 01:26:55,730
The people will have to decide that.
- I should first get the ticket, right?

1219
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:58,269
That should be confirmed by the Party.
Not the public road.

1220
01:26:58,394 --> 01:27:02,310
Protest has become a fashion.
Go and sit where the problem is.

1221
01:27:02,519 --> 01:27:04,894
With hired hooligans
you have occupied the road.

1222
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:06,355
Is it your father's property?

1223
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:07,980
Or your mother-in-law's bequest to you?

1224
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,560
I must do this for my goal
to be achieved. It is my need.

1225
01:27:10,769 --> 01:27:12,185
All those waiting here also have needs.

1226
01:27:12,265 --> 01:27:15,394
They are not here to watch your show
or listen to your slogans.

1227
01:27:15,769 --> 01:27:18,644
A mother and a child lost their lives.
Will you get them back?

1228
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,769
Students couldn't go to the exam.

1229
01:27:22,519 --> 01:27:25,269
Employees to the office.
Will you work instead?

1230
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:29,519
Hundreds of auto drivers and daily
labourers go to earn their square meal.

1231
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,060
Will you satisfy their hunger? Speak!

1232
01:27:32,144 --> 01:27:35,480
How am I concerned with their problems?
I want my position.

1233
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:39,519
Hey! When you expect a post you must
claim the problems not create them.

1234
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:42,810
A man like you is unfit not to just
claim the seat but to even look at it.

1235
01:27:42,894 --> 01:27:45,435
Hey, if I get the seat and win,
I will first see your end.

1236
01:27:45,519 --> 01:27:49,019
Wrong! Threats don't suit my body.

1237
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:49,689
What will you do?

1238
01:27:49,769 --> 01:27:51,564
The more you threaten the
more I will confront.

1239
01:27:51,644 --> 01:27:53,394
I will reverse the picture...you..!

1240
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:57,230
Dad! Some guy is obstructing me.

1241
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:59,894
Our plan might be foiled.
- Hey, we will take care of him later.

1242
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:02,894
They confirmed the MP ticket for you.

1243
01:28:03,019 --> 01:28:04,269
I will go to the Party office.

1244
01:28:04,394 --> 01:28:06,855
Collect the B Form and directly
go to the Collector's office.

1245
01:28:06,935 --> 01:28:08,105
Today is the last date.

1246
01:28:08,185 --> 01:28:09,894
Just another hour left for
the nomination.

1247
01:28:10,185 --> 01:28:11,894
Come urgently.
- Ok, Dad.

1248
01:28:12,144 --> 01:28:13,894
Party has given me the ticket!

1249
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:17,644
Crap!

1250
01:28:24,506 --> 01:28:26,685
I must file the nomination.
Just an hour left.

1251
01:28:26,894 --> 01:28:27,810
Hey, get the car ready.

1252
01:28:29,144 --> 01:28:31,894
Hey! You said you will throw
and reverse the picture.

1253
01:28:32,519 --> 01:28:33,644
What can you do?

1254
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,144
Hey, police! Clear the traffic.

1255
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:36,810
Ok, sir.

1256
01:28:36,935 --> 01:28:38,435
Constables! Remove the barricades.

1257
01:28:38,519 --> 01:28:39,269
Come on. Come on.

1258
01:28:40,769 --> 01:28:42,269
Police! Wait a while.

1259
01:28:45,769 --> 01:28:47,894
Mother! You lost your daughter.

1260
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:49,855
Do you have to go urgently?

1261
01:28:49,935 --> 01:28:55,144
Urgency is for saving a life
not for burning a body, son.

1262
01:28:55,644 --> 01:28:57,560
Brother, do you have to go for the exam?

1263
01:28:57,644 --> 01:29:00,105
Time is up, brother. Only next time.

1264
01:29:00,185 --> 01:29:00,935
Huh, gentleman?

1265
01:29:01,019 --> 01:29:03,439
My flight is already delayed.
I have to catch it only tomorrow.

1266
01:29:03,519 --> 01:29:05,394
God bless you.
- God bless you too.

1267
01:29:05,685 --> 01:29:07,283
Anyone else who has to go immediately?

1268
01:29:07,363 --> 01:29:09,134
No! No!

1269
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:11,644
All of you leave your vehicles
there and move aside.

1270
01:29:12,144 --> 01:29:13,394
We will see how he can go.

1271
01:29:21,519 --> 01:29:23,560
Dad! This rowdy is not allowing me
to move from here.

1272
01:29:23,769 --> 01:29:25,019
Come out somehow.

1273
01:29:25,329 --> 01:29:26,935
I am already at the Collector's office.

1274
01:29:27,019 --> 01:29:28,144
Only half an hour left.

1275
01:29:28,269 --> 01:29:29,560
Come fast.
- Go!

1276
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,560
Go. Go back. Back.

1277
01:29:55,644 --> 01:29:57,644
Hey, what are you looking?
Hey, what are you doing?

1278
01:29:57,769 --> 01:30:00,519
They are not obeying you.
- Why will they listen to me Sir?

1279
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:02,894
It's getting late. Come, man. Come.

1280
01:30:03,769 --> 01:30:06,144
The mad dog is running,
see and enjoy.

1281
01:30:15,873 --> 01:30:16,935
Are all the documents ready?

1282
01:30:17,019 --> 01:30:18,769
All are ready, sir. Only your son
has to come and sign.

1283
01:30:20,519 --> 01:30:21,789
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

1284
01:30:23,269 --> 01:30:24,894
Sir, the Collector is leaving, sir.

1285
01:30:25,519 --> 01:30:27,560
Sir, sir...please, sir.
My son is on the way.

1286
01:30:27,685 --> 01:30:28,644
He has to file the nomination.

1287
01:30:28,769 --> 01:30:30,564
His future is in your hands, sir.
- No, the time is over.

1288
01:30:30,644 --> 01:30:31,977
Sir, sir...
- Please stop!

1289
01:30:33,645 --> 01:30:36,769
Oh! Crap! Where is this fellow?

1290
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:43,894
My ill luck. He is here after
everything is over.

1291
01:30:44,644 --> 01:30:46,269
Did you check how many missed calls?

1292
01:30:46,394 --> 01:30:48,769
23...club them and it is 5...
my lucky number.

1293
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:51,310
Is that a joke?

1294
01:30:51,644 --> 01:30:53,855
By the way, you would clear even a
heavy traffic jam and come, right?

1295
01:30:53,935 --> 01:30:55,894
Oh, no. I left rowdyism long back.

1296
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:59,894
Moreover, when you are out of town,
where will I get the courage from?

1297
01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:02,894
That's why I stayed put
in the mechanic shed.

1298
01:31:03,269 --> 01:31:05,144
Ok, did you miss me?
- Yes.

1299
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,519
How much?
- This much.

1300
01:31:08,644 --> 01:31:10,435
Ah! Hey...don't. Don't.
Hold it...

1301
01:35:04,727 --> 01:35:06,147
What happened? Speed breaker?

1302
01:35:06,227 --> 01:35:08,352
No, love breaker. Look there.

1303
01:35:08,977 --> 01:35:11,144
Tomorrow is a holiday for the school.
It's Vijaya Dasami

1304
01:35:11,644 --> 01:35:14,602
How long will you be afraid?
- It's not fear, dear. It's respect.

1305
01:35:14,727 --> 01:35:16,519
Talk to him about our
matter at least today.

1306
01:35:16,602 --> 01:35:18,102
Ask him for my hand. Go.

1307
01:35:18,977 --> 01:35:21,144
Hmm...I asked him several times already.
- Damn you!

1308
01:35:21,519 --> 01:35:24,814
You go to him each time,
say good morning and come back.

1309
01:35:24,894 --> 01:35:27,602
I don't know, dear.
I am not afraid to face even the lion.

1310
01:35:27,727 --> 01:35:31,019
But as soon as I see Master,
my hands go up in the air.

1311
01:35:31,144 --> 01:35:34,394
Look. If you don't ask him today,
just forget me after that.

1312
01:35:34,519 --> 01:35:36,272
Oh, no. That is not possible.
- What is not possible?

1313
01:35:36,352 --> 01:35:38,269
It is not possible to forget you
until I die.

1314
01:35:38,951 --> 01:35:40,977
So, how long do we roam in love?

1315
01:35:41,144 --> 01:35:42,477
Already age is setting in.

1316
01:35:42,852 --> 01:35:43,564
For whom?

1317
01:35:43,644 --> 01:35:47,144
I know. You will never get old.
You can sing duets life-long.

1318
01:35:47,519 --> 01:35:48,727
But I am getting old

1319
01:35:49,227 --> 01:35:52,102
I want to get married,
have children and play with them.

1320
01:35:52,425 --> 01:35:55,022
There are so many children in the school
you work for in Rajahmundry.

1321
01:35:55,102 --> 01:35:55,977
Play with them.

1322
01:35:56,602 --> 01:35:59,602
There are a thousand.
But I need one of my own.

1323
01:35:59,727 --> 01:36:02,064
You want a child now, right?

1324
01:36:02,144 --> 01:36:04,314
Oh! You are man enough. I know that.

1325
01:36:04,394 --> 01:36:06,102
But prove it now. Go.

1326
01:36:09,227 --> 01:36:10,144
What happened dear?

1327
01:36:10,227 --> 01:36:12,269
All the time Master says
he doesn't know me.

1328
01:36:12,352 --> 01:36:13,397
You know me, right?

1329
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:14,064
Very well.

1330
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:16,227
Then, go and ask for my sake. Go.

1331
01:36:16,727 --> 01:36:17,808
Ok.

1332
01:36:19,602 --> 01:36:20,727
Hold this.
- Wear them.

1333
01:36:21,102 --> 01:36:24,019
The fear in the eyes won't show.
- It may not be polite in front of Master

1334
01:36:24,144 --> 01:36:25,064
Hold them.

1335
01:36:25,144 --> 01:36:26,477
Hmm...go bravely.

1336
01:36:27,396 --> 01:36:31,019
Ask bravely...keep your chest straight...
go fast.

1337
01:36:33,394 --> 01:36:34,737
See you, sir.
- Ok.

1338
01:36:35,519 --> 01:36:37,977
Master! Greetings, Master!

1339
01:36:38,727 --> 01:36:39,522
Who are you?

1340
01:36:39,602 --> 01:36:40,852
I am your student, Master.

1341
01:36:40,977 --> 01:36:42,477
Narasimha
- I don't remember...?

1342
01:36:43,227 --> 01:36:45,644
I studied up to Class V under you,
Master.

1343
01:36:45,727 --> 01:36:47,144
Didn't I tell you I don't remember?

1344
01:36:47,644 --> 01:36:49,602
Oho! It's ok, Master.

1345
01:36:50,102 --> 01:36:51,102
Oh!
- Son!

1346
01:36:52,977 --> 01:36:53,772
Master!

1347
01:36:53,852 --> 01:36:55,102
Why did you come here?

1348
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:56,852
Your daughter...

1349
01:36:57,227 --> 01:36:58,327
My daughter?

1350
01:36:58,727 --> 01:37:00,269
I came to ask your daughter.

1351
01:37:01,769 --> 01:37:04,227
Like I wanted to ask her
if she returned from the town.

1352
01:37:04,352 --> 01:37:05,064
You...

1353
01:37:05,144 --> 01:37:08,102
It is about time. But why?

1354
01:37:08,852 --> 01:37:10,352
They said her vehicle has a problem.

1355
01:37:10,852 --> 01:37:12,269
I am a famous mechanic in Vizag.

1356
01:37:12,519 --> 01:37:15,019
I repair all the vehicles in this colony.

1357
01:37:15,394 --> 01:37:18,269
I wanted to ask your daughter....
- My daughter has no vehicle.

1358
01:37:20,394 --> 01:37:21,602
Or was it your vehicle, sir?

1359
01:37:21,727 --> 01:37:22,977
Or was it your vehicle, sir?

1360
01:37:23,102 --> 01:37:24,197
Oh!

1361
01:37:25,352 --> 01:37:27,769
Then when you buy a new vehicle,
that might need some repair...

1362
01:37:27,852 --> 01:37:28,564
Hey! Dumbo!

1363
01:37:28,644 --> 01:37:31,852
Give it to me for repair then.
I do a good job.

1364
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:33,102
See you, Master.

1365
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:38,102
Come.

1366
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,227
Hey...hey...

1367
01:37:40,602 --> 01:37:41,522
look here.

1368
01:37:41,602 --> 01:37:43,102
Master is watching.

1369
01:37:44,826 --> 01:37:45,680
Go...

1370
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:51,737
Narasimha! You have done a good job.

1371
01:38:10,112 --> 01:38:11,487
Hey! Ravi! What are you doing?

1372
01:38:11,737 --> 01:38:14,695
Gone. Our honour, prestige
everything is gone.

1373
01:38:14,775 --> 01:38:15,990
Even the MP seat is gone.

1374
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:20,362
You can get the stupid MP seat in
the bye election if not in this election.

1375
01:38:20,987 --> 01:38:24,838
But you will never get the post of
a son-in-law for

1376
01:38:24,918 --> 01:38:28,482
a billionaire central minister.

1377
01:38:29,129 --> 01:38:31,653
As soon as you tie the knot,

1378
01:38:32,237 --> 01:38:34,487
Narasimha's death is final.

1379
01:38:39,112 --> 01:38:43,112
He disgraced you at the
four-road junction.

1380
01:38:43,778 --> 01:38:49,987
His cry of death should be heard
in all four directions. Come.

1381
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:53,612
Come.
- Come.

1382
01:39:00,445 --> 01:39:01,612
Hey, Ranga!

1383
01:39:01,692 --> 01:39:03,032
Brother!
- What are you doing?

1384
01:39:03,112 --> 01:39:05,445
I am repairing the gear box, brother.

1385
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:06,945
It will be done in an hour.

1386
01:39:07,695 --> 01:39:09,657
How long should I ask you
for spanner?

1387
01:39:09,737 --> 01:39:11,070
6x8 is not here, Sir.

1388
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:11,862
Manga!

1389
01:39:12,195 --> 01:39:13,112
Owner sir!

1390
01:39:13,237 --> 01:39:15,532
There is a new spanner in the store room.
Get it.

1391
01:39:15,612 --> 01:39:16,487
6x8

1392
01:39:18,195 --> 01:39:20,570
Owner sir! Here. New 6x8 spanner.

1393
01:39:20,695 --> 01:39:22,237
It got late. Sorry.

1394
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,740
What is this? What happened?

1395
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:25,237
I will tell you, sir.
- Manga!

1396
01:39:28,445 --> 01:39:28,945
Get lost.

1397
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:31,862
Hey, Manga! Do you know what you are doing?
- Hey, get lost. Move.

1398
01:39:33,487 --> 01:39:34,737
Hey, Manga!
- Give me side.

1399
01:39:35,195 --> 01:39:35,945
Hey..

1400
01:39:38,487 --> 01:39:39,487
Idiot!

1401
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,153
Where is it?

1402
01:39:47,362 --> 01:39:48,487
I kept it here!

1403
01:39:55,653 --> 01:39:56,862
Oh, my! Manga!
- Hey..

1404
01:39:57,778 --> 01:39:58,987
She has pushed again.

1405
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:02,070
Hey! Manga
- Get lost, man!

1406
01:40:08,653 --> 01:40:10,237
I asked you for a 6x8 spanner

1407
01:40:10,487 --> 01:40:12,532
And you are here after
breaking 68 items.

1408
01:40:12,612 --> 01:40:14,237
Sorry, owner sir.
- What sorry?

1409
01:40:14,362 --> 01:40:16,695
Very sorry, owner sir.
- How many times did this happen?

1410
01:40:16,778 --> 01:40:18,362
I don't know. I did not count.

1411
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:20,320
You have no work here from now. Go.

1412
01:40:20,487 --> 01:40:21,615
I will die, owner sir.

1413
01:40:21,695 --> 01:40:22,737
Get up...up...up..

1414
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:25,407
Can't you work elsewhere?
- I will not work anywhere else.

1415
01:40:25,487 --> 01:40:26,532
But why?

1416
01:40:26,612 --> 01:40:28,987
You educated me. You employed me.

1417
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:30,320
You found a match for me.

1418
01:40:30,445 --> 01:40:32,990
You are the one to perform my wedding.
It is you who gave me life.

1419
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:35,362
Life-long, you will be my owner,
owner sir.

1420
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:39,487
Hey! What is that get-up?

1421
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:42,445
Brother! As the roles played
by NTR sir.

1422
01:40:42,737 --> 01:40:44,820
Manga, makes me take as
many make overs.

1423
01:40:44,945 --> 01:40:46,820
Ten incarnations every month...

1424
01:40:46,945 --> 01:40:49,070
One of these days
I will put on the universal form.

1425
01:40:49,945 --> 01:40:51,532
Brother! Look at my face!

1426
01:40:51,612 --> 01:40:54,112
Why did you put your face in the mire man?
- This is not mire, brother.

1427
01:40:54,195 --> 01:40:57,070
Manga anointed me with
ten cups of coffee.

1428
01:40:57,487 --> 01:40:58,407
Hey! What brother?

1429
01:40:58,487 --> 01:41:01,624
Isn't that why I compensate you with
occasional coffee, tea,

1430
01:41:01,704 --> 01:41:03,615
cigarette and brandy?

1431
01:41:03,695 --> 01:41:05,612
Is it enough to compensate them? .

1432
01:41:05,695 --> 01:41:08,445
So many things are broken here
Who will compensate for them?

1433
01:41:08,653 --> 01:41:11,320
I am not the only partner for this shed.
Don't you know?

1434
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,695
I know.
- What do you know?

1435
01:41:12,778 --> 01:41:15,237
First year temporary,
second year permanent, third year partner.

1436
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,990
It's four years since I have come.
Four years.

1437
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:19,570
Even if you calculate that way,
you won't get even a month's salary.

1438
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:22,653
Hey! Idiot! Stupid! Come out!

1439
01:41:22,737 --> 01:41:24,945
I will mix the thinner in your brandy

1440
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:28,320
And once you are lost I will
get your wife and make her thrash you.

1441
01:41:28,677 --> 01:41:30,862
What is this?
- Not my voice, brother!

1442
01:41:30,945 --> 01:41:32,237
Manga's mind's voice.

1443
01:41:32,317 --> 01:41:34,362
Oh! She speaks so well?

1444
01:41:34,487 --> 01:41:35,576
When you are around she is like this.

1445
01:41:35,656 --> 01:41:37,532
If you are not here,
she will sell half the Vizag.

1446
01:41:37,612 --> 01:41:38,695
She is a witch.

1447
01:41:39,945 --> 01:41:40,653
Is it?

1448
01:41:41,585 --> 01:41:42,820
Just a little.

1449
01:41:43,445 --> 01:41:44,362
Go!

1450
01:41:45,362 --> 01:41:49,362
All of you go.
Rearrange all that and get down to work.

1451
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:51,612
Manga!
- Owner sir!

1452
01:41:52,244 --> 01:41:53,237
Here.

1453
01:41:54,958 --> 01:41:57,320
Look. You can have respect
for the owner.

1454
01:41:57,862 --> 01:41:59,778
Not fear. Understand? Go.
- Okay.

1455
01:42:01,164 --> 01:42:02,362
Hey, shorty! Come aside.

1456
01:42:02,612 --> 01:42:07,237
Brother! When you need a wrench
or a bag call 'Ranga' and I will come.

1457
01:42:07,434 --> 01:42:11,070
Call 'Linga' and he will come.
Or call 'thief' and he will come.

1458
01:42:11,487 --> 01:42:13,157
But don't call Manga brother.

1459
01:42:13,237 --> 01:42:14,740
I am not able to bear her torture.

1460
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,237
Okay. Okay.
- Thanks brother!

1461
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:18,362
You...you...

1462
01:42:24,237 --> 01:42:25,157
Hey, Thota!

1463
01:42:25,237 --> 01:42:26,487
Come brother-in-law.
- Greetings, brother!

1464
01:42:29,862 --> 01:42:31,237
Not just me.

1465
01:42:31,570 --> 01:42:35,683
Watching him running about all the lanes
to file a nomination,

1466
01:42:35,763 --> 01:42:37,698
the whole town has spat.

1467
01:42:37,778 --> 01:42:39,157
If I go to distribute these wedding cards.

1468
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:41,195
They will spit on me too.

1469
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:44,112
That's why I burned them all.

1470
01:42:44,237 --> 01:42:46,987
But I brought you some as a sample.

1471
01:42:47,112 --> 01:42:48,112
You know why?

1472
01:42:48,237 --> 01:42:52,112
Because I got MP printed after his name.

1473
01:42:53,487 --> 01:42:55,907
Get them framed.

1474
01:42:55,987 --> 01:42:57,778
And hang them all over your house.

1475
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:59,862
Hey! Get the vehicles ready.

1476
01:43:00,195 --> 01:43:02,820
If I stay longer here,
my own honour will be a question.

1477
01:43:03,570 --> 01:43:07,070
Narasimha! You are Lord
Narasimha for my daughter.

1478
01:43:07,237 --> 01:43:10,487
My time is good and so their
true colours are out.

1479
01:43:11,112 --> 01:43:14,195
I must build a temple for you
and worship.

1480
01:43:22,945 --> 01:43:24,945
From your reaction I understand.

1481
01:43:25,237 --> 01:43:26,737
You completed three pegs.

1482
01:43:27,237 --> 01:43:29,407
This is when the truth comes out. Tell me.

1483
01:43:29,487 --> 01:43:30,237
Ask brother!

1484
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:32,487
What is the town talking about me?

1485
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:35,070
Lord Indra and the moon
are zero before you brother.

1486
01:43:35,195 --> 01:43:36,945
You are number one in the public.

1487
01:43:37,195 --> 01:43:39,157
They say you are Satakarni,
the king of Amaravati.

1488
01:43:39,237 --> 01:43:40,487
Hey! He is drunk. Stop him.

1489
01:43:41,778 --> 01:43:44,032
Brother! I will tell you.
- Okay, tell me.

1490
01:43:44,112 --> 01:43:45,820
You are a rowdy.
- Correct.

1491
01:43:45,987 --> 01:43:47,362
Mechanic rowdy.

1492
01:43:47,442 --> 01:43:49,237
Hey, pour him the drink.
- Thank you.

1493
01:43:49,362 --> 01:43:50,695
You are a factionist.

1494
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:54,487
A cyclist. But in love, you are a waste.

1495
01:43:54,567 --> 01:43:55,862
Hey! Remove his glass.

1496
01:43:55,945 --> 01:43:57,862
But I spoke the truth, brother!
- Brother! Gowri!

1497
01:43:58,737 --> 01:43:59,612
Gowri! Please come.

1498
01:43:59,695 --> 01:44:02,445
Brother! Just as you said,
I will change all the colours.

1499
01:44:02,525 --> 01:44:03,907
I will get new curtains.

1500
01:44:03,987 --> 01:44:06,282
I will remove the threshold
and I will get a new slab done.

1501
01:44:06,362 --> 01:44:08,032
Ah! I know how pure you are.

1502
01:44:08,112 --> 01:44:09,820
Stop overdoing your part.
- Sister-in-law, sit down.

1503
01:44:10,487 --> 01:44:12,865
Brother you both sit and talk,
we will come later, Go.

1504
01:44:12,945 --> 01:44:15,112
Hey! Sit down, men. There is
not going to be any love scene here.

1505
01:44:15,237 --> 01:44:16,990
A fight scene is going to take place.
- Congrats, brother!

1506
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:17,532
What for?

1507
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:19,945
If it is a fight scene,
you will anyway win, right?

1508
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:21,320
Correct. Give him some.

1509
01:44:22,487 --> 01:44:23,320
Thanks Gowri.

1510
01:44:23,862 --> 01:44:24,740
What are these?

1511
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:25,407
What are they?

1512
01:44:25,487 --> 01:44:27,237
See the number of complaints against you!

1513
01:44:27,663 --> 01:44:30,695
When you were not in town
I never behaved like a rowdy Gowri,

1514
01:44:30,820 --> 01:44:33,320
I gave up all that Gowri...
So much drama!

1515
01:44:33,487 --> 01:44:35,362
What will you say now?
- It's all a lie, Gowri.

1516
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:37,362
Someone made it up.
- Hey! Stop it.

1517
01:44:37,987 --> 01:44:39,612
The poor baby is telling the truth.

1518
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:41,653
Idiot.
- What Gowri says is true.

1519
01:44:41,733 --> 01:44:43,820
There are six cases against
brother in the local PS.

1520
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:46,195
But no FIR is filed.
- Correct.

1521
01:44:46,487 --> 01:44:47,320
Shall I take some?

1522
01:44:47,612 --> 01:44:49,990
No. Already you are faltering.

1523
01:44:50,702 --> 01:44:51,432
Here, look at this.

1524
01:44:51,512 --> 01:44:53,570
Look, you hacked a man's arm
right in the middle of the town.

1525
01:44:55,237 --> 01:44:56,320
Why did he?

1526
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,577
I should tell you even that, right?

1527
01:44:57,657 --> 01:45:00,820
I will tell you the truth even
if you don't give me the drink.

1528
01:45:00,945 --> 01:45:02,817
A vagrant on a bike pulled
the gold chain off a lady's neck

1529
01:45:02,897 --> 01:45:05,411
when she was buying vegetables.

1530
01:45:05,653 --> 01:45:08,362
Her neck is slashed.
She is in hospital fighting for her life.

1531
01:45:09,237 --> 01:45:10,362
Ok. Leave that.

1532
01:45:10,778 --> 01:45:12,487
What's your answer for this?
- What is this?

1533
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:13,653
You were driving

1534
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:17,237
And you ran the car into a pole along with
a boy coming in the opposite direction.

1535
01:45:17,362 --> 01:45:19,112
He is in hospital

1536
01:45:19,237 --> 01:45:21,122
His mother lodged a complaint.
- She gave a complaint.

1537
01:45:21,202 --> 01:45:23,362
But did the police write the FIR?
- Why didn't they?

1538
01:45:23,570 --> 01:45:24,407
What did that idiot do?

1539
01:45:24,487 --> 01:45:28,445
PC Raja's sister rejected his love
and so he poured acid on her face.

1540
01:45:28,612 --> 01:45:30,112
Her face is burnt and
she is in the hospital.

1541
01:45:30,237 --> 01:45:33,070
How dare you reject me
and love someone else? Go...

1542
01:45:33,195 --> 01:45:34,362
Get married to him, now.

1543
01:45:34,487 --> 01:45:35,820
What's wrong in breaking his head?

1544
01:45:36,195 --> 01:45:37,320
Rogue...

1545
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:40,653
I am getting foul words.
- No, man. Sister-in-law will sermonize.

1546
01:45:40,737 --> 01:45:42,320
Let that idiot die in the hospital.

1547
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:46,839
Why did you torch the truck?

1548
01:45:49,256 --> 01:45:50,301
Why did you become dull?

1549
01:45:50,381 --> 01:45:52,964
You are a hero, boss.
I handle case.

1550
01:45:53,339 --> 01:45:55,631
Gowri! Do you know what...in the truck?

1551
01:45:55,714 --> 01:45:58,301
Duplicate medicines
to supply to the hospital.

1552
01:45:58,381 --> 01:46:00,506
Expired tonics and expired tablets.

1553
01:46:01,339 --> 01:46:02,339
Pour the petrol.

1554
01:46:02,839 --> 01:46:03,839
Hm..let's go.

1555
01:46:13,964 --> 01:46:16,214
Do you know how many would have
died using those medicines?

1556
01:46:16,464 --> 01:46:18,464
Now only the truck is dead.

1557
01:46:21,839 --> 01:46:23,672
Why did you create a scene in public?

1558
01:46:24,714 --> 01:46:26,467
Brother, it's not that guy.
- It is this guy.

1559
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:27,464
Hit him brother!

1560
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:32,089
Hit him, hit him.
- hit him more, brother.

1561
01:46:32,381 --> 01:46:34,839
Hit him more, brother.

1562
01:46:35,214 --> 01:46:36,547
Idiot..

1563
01:46:40,381 --> 01:46:41,589
This is your matter.

1564
01:46:41,714 --> 01:46:42,634
My matter?
- Yes.

1565
01:46:42,714 --> 01:46:44,551
Yes. You are very fond of kids, right?
- Yes.

1566
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:45,634
They pick up such kids

1567
01:46:45,714 --> 01:46:48,756
Breaking their hands
or legs and gorging out their eyes.

1568
01:46:48,964 --> 01:46:50,964
And turn them into beggars Gowri.

1569
01:46:52,256 --> 01:46:53,631
How did they have the heart to do it?

1570
01:46:54,214 --> 01:46:55,547
Why are they being so unfair?

1571
01:46:55,964 --> 01:46:57,339
So brutal with children?

1572
01:46:58,381 --> 01:47:00,131
But why are you doing all this?

1573
01:47:00,589 --> 01:47:02,256
Aren't there police? Aren't there courts?

1574
01:47:02,756 --> 01:47:04,089
Yes.

1575
01:47:05,547 --> 01:47:06,381
But no.

1576
01:47:07,006 --> 01:47:08,131
Why the tension?

1577
01:47:08,339 --> 01:47:10,676
Hey! Is that a fresh glass?
- Of course, brother!

1578
01:47:10,756 --> 01:47:13,006
Gowri! Even ladies drink these days.

1579
01:47:13,589 --> 01:47:14,964
Have a peg too.

1580
01:47:15,131 --> 01:47:16,881
Ok, give me.
- Hey! I was joking.

1581
01:47:17,256 --> 01:47:20,051
It's ok. Give me. Give me.
- No, no. It's not good for your health.

1582
01:47:20,131 --> 01:47:22,464
Gowri! No.. No..
- Only one peg, right?

1583
01:47:22,631 --> 01:47:25,256
Gowri! No, no, This is men's drink
- Give it to me..

1584
01:47:25,381 --> 01:47:28,128
Ladies shouldn't. Listen to me.
- Who said ladies shouldn't?

1585
01:47:28,339 --> 01:47:29,964
Give it.
- Gowri, no.

1586
01:47:30,089 --> 01:47:31,381
Gowri what are you doing?

1587
01:47:31,506 --> 01:47:33,714
I am telling you...no. wait.
- No problem.

1588
01:47:36,506 --> 01:47:39,506
Madam! The young master
has hanged himself.

1589
01:47:41,256 --> 01:47:42,339
Ravi!

1590
01:47:52,547 --> 01:47:53,964
Madam! Madam!

1591
01:47:59,651 --> 01:48:00,943
Forgive me, dad.

1592
01:48:01,151 --> 01:48:02,818
After all this disgrace

1593
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:05,276
I am not able to live like
a dead man in this world.

1594
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:07,795
But until those responsible for my death
are made to pay,

1595
01:48:07,875 --> 01:48:09,321
my soul will have no peace.

1596
01:48:09,401 --> 01:48:11,526
Your ever loving son, Ravi Shankar.

1597
01:48:15,693 --> 01:48:17,151
Why is he so late?

1598
01:48:17,526 --> 01:48:19,488
He is like that. Hey!
Why are you so late?

1599
01:48:19,568 --> 01:48:21,693
What is the time?
Chicken faced fellow....!

1600
01:48:21,943 --> 01:48:23,401
Greetings sir...please come.

1601
01:48:23,568 --> 01:48:26,818
Welcome..
- Manga! Wait a minute.

1602
01:48:27,026 --> 01:48:28,443
Lady, remove the evil eye.

1603
01:48:29,693 --> 01:48:32,568
Hey! Whose eyes will fall on
Manga to remove the evil?

1604
01:48:32,693 --> 01:48:33,738
My own eyes, bro.
- Yes.

1605
01:48:33,818 --> 01:48:35,943
I never saw Manga with her head lowered.

1606
01:48:36,026 --> 01:48:38,943
By the way why is brother not here yet?
- He said he would bring Gowri along

1607
01:48:39,026 --> 01:48:40,693
He is with a Lady... it takes time.
- I know.

1608
01:48:40,776 --> 01:48:42,863
It's ok even if he is late. There
is still time for the auspicious hour.

1609
01:48:42,943 --> 01:48:45,029
Once Narasimha comes and says Manga.

1610
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:47,488
She will push away the groom,
fly the priest.

1611
01:48:47,568 --> 01:48:51,193
The thread will be in the bin and
the sacred rice will land in every mouth.

1612
01:48:55,954 --> 01:48:58,068
Go, go. He is coming.

1613
01:48:58,148 --> 01:49:00,276
Not today. Let me speak some other day.

1614
01:49:00,401 --> 01:49:01,693
I must go to Manga's wedding.

1615
01:49:01,773 --> 01:49:03,068
There is still time for that.

1616
01:49:03,193 --> 01:49:05,776
Let us fix our wedding too
and go proudly as a pair.

1617
01:49:05,943 --> 01:49:06,693
Go first.

1618
01:49:09,526 --> 01:49:11,318
Why this style now?
- Not style.

1619
01:49:11,526 --> 01:49:13,943
The fear in my eyes should not be seen.
That's why.

1620
01:49:14,026 --> 01:49:18,026
Oho! Strongly, clearly,
tell him our matter. Ok?

1621
01:49:18,109 --> 01:49:19,723
Oh, yes. I will reverse the picture.
Just watch.

1622
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:20,674
Go and say there.

1623
01:49:26,151 --> 01:49:28,693
Master! Greetings Master!

1624
01:49:29,276 --> 01:49:30,318
How are you Master?

1625
01:49:30,526 --> 01:49:31,943
I am fine. Who are you?

1626
01:49:32,151 --> 01:49:32,901
Narasimha...

1627
01:49:33,193 --> 01:49:34,401
Your student, Master. 5th..

1628
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:36,276
Fifth...I studied till fifth class.

1629
01:49:36,401 --> 01:49:38,321
I remember

1630
01:49:38,401 --> 01:49:39,693
Thank you, Sir.
- Like..

1631
01:49:39,776 --> 01:49:43,443
I don't remember you as a student
but I know you are a mechanic.

1632
01:49:44,109 --> 01:49:45,943
You came to my house, right?
- Yes, Master.

1633
01:49:46,401 --> 01:49:47,401
Master,

1634
01:49:47,693 --> 01:49:49,134
I will ask you something today.

1635
01:49:49,214 --> 01:49:50,818
You shouldn't chide me. Please.

1636
01:49:51,526 --> 01:49:52,276
Hmm...ask.

1637
01:49:52,605 --> 01:49:53,943
Your daughter...I...

1638
01:49:54,023 --> 01:49:55,415
Yah as soon as she buys a vehicle,
I will inform you.

1639
01:49:55,495 --> 01:49:56,613
Not that Master...

1640
01:49:56,693 --> 01:49:57,901
Your daughter...I ...

1641
01:49:58,068 --> 01:49:58,818
My daughter...

1642
01:49:59,438 --> 01:50:01,901
Can I ask straight, Master?
- Whatever it is tell me so I understand...

1643
01:50:02,314 --> 01:50:04,943
Can I ask your daughter
when she would but a new vehicle?

1644
01:50:05,287 --> 01:50:08,401
Go and ask her.
Why to torture me on the road like this?

1645
01:50:08,568 --> 01:50:10,026
No other work...

1646
01:50:13,943 --> 01:50:15,234
That...

1647
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:24,193
Keep the cumin seeds
and jiggery paste on the bride's head.

1648
01:50:24,276 --> 01:50:26,193
Pundit! No cumin...no jaggery.

1649
01:50:26,318 --> 01:50:28,693
My owner sir is yet to come.
Please wait for a while.

1650
01:50:29,526 --> 01:50:30,651
Please wait.

1651
01:50:33,193 --> 01:50:35,776
Look at the face! King in the city.

1652
01:50:35,943 --> 01:50:37,693
But not infront of the father-in-law ...

1653
01:50:42,526 --> 01:50:43,568
Narasimha!
- Sir!

1654
01:50:43,693 --> 01:50:45,943
Thanks to you there is
no competition for me.

1655
01:50:46,068 --> 01:50:48,488
I won as the MP.
I will be a minister too very soon.

1656
01:50:48,568 --> 01:50:50,693
If you want to do some good
to someone.

1657
01:50:50,773 --> 01:50:52,276
Let me know. I will do it for you.

1658
01:50:52,401 --> 01:50:53,401
Hey! Oldie!

1659
01:50:53,568 --> 01:50:55,193
First ask him to take care of me.

1660
01:50:55,901 --> 01:50:58,526
Or you speak to my father yourself.

1661
01:50:58,651 --> 01:50:59,526
And get us married.

1662
01:50:59,693 --> 01:51:01,318
Narasimha! Love?

1663
01:51:02,109 --> 01:51:05,307
The girl seems to have a sharp tongue.
Be careful.

1664
01:51:05,387 --> 01:51:07,401
Oye! Go without annoying.

1665
01:51:07,526 --> 01:51:10,818
Our friends...friends...
you drive man! Drive.

1666
01:51:11,091 --> 01:51:13,151
See, dear!
- While talking to elders...

1667
01:51:14,318 --> 01:51:15,109
Okay.

1668
01:51:16,324 --> 01:51:18,234
Ranga! We are on the way there.

1669
01:52:08,693 --> 01:52:13,151
Sir! You gave life to
my fatherless child.

1670
01:52:13,234 --> 01:52:16,693
They said there is no wedding
in her horoscope.

1671
01:52:17,075 --> 01:52:21,651
But you ignored it and arranged
for the wedding.

1672
01:52:22,276 --> 01:52:24,818
But finally the horoscope proved right.

1673
01:52:25,151 --> 01:52:27,318
Her life is destroyed.

1674
01:52:28,526 --> 01:52:30,109
Look at her. Look.

1675
01:52:30,276 --> 01:52:33,222
My daughter remains a
living dead body.

1676
01:52:34,033 --> 01:52:38,109
No one can change her fate.
No one...

1677
01:52:39,466 --> 01:52:41,196
Rami Reddy's men had come.

1678
01:52:42,901 --> 01:52:44,693
Narasimha!

1679
01:52:45,901 --> 01:52:47,443
Hey! Narasimha!

1680
01:52:58,943 --> 01:53:00,818
Hey! Where are you?

1681
01:53:02,693 --> 01:53:04,026
Hey, stop!

1682
01:53:09,709 --> 01:53:11,101
Shekhar.

1683
01:53:12,943 --> 01:53:16,738
Do you want to get married
with Narasimha's blessings?

1684
01:53:16,818 --> 01:53:20,318
If you want the knot to be tied
in your neck, don't you need a neck?

1685
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:21,642
No..

1686
01:53:24,193 --> 01:53:26,568
Please, spare us. Please spare us.

1687
01:53:26,693 --> 01:53:28,568
Don't do anything to us.

1688
01:53:28,818 --> 01:53:31,443
Hey! Burn the hall down.

1689
01:53:49,401 --> 01:53:51,401
Narasimha!
- Brother..

1690
01:54:16,318 --> 01:54:17,818
Hey! I am waiting for you.

1691
01:54:17,901 --> 01:54:19,943
Hey! Beat him to death.

1692
01:54:28,693 --> 01:54:29,443
Husband!

1693
01:54:30,068 --> 01:54:31,863
Husband! He is enraged.

1694
01:54:31,943 --> 01:54:33,134
What if something happens to you,
please don't go.

1695
01:54:33,214 --> 01:54:34,196
Vasantha!

1696
01:54:34,276 --> 01:54:36,443
Just as you said...watch from inside...

1697
01:54:53,026 --> 01:54:54,526
Hello.. Commissioner office?

1698
01:55:38,651 --> 01:55:40,693
My son died because of you.

1699
01:55:40,901 --> 01:55:43,234
His soul must smile seeing you die.

1700
01:55:46,193 --> 01:55:48,944
It is not in your capacity to kill me.
That is His problem.

1701
01:55:49,024 --> 01:55:52,234
Whom to spare and whom to send...
the account is all there.

1702
01:55:52,526 --> 01:55:54,196
He had no marriage written
on his forehead.

1703
01:55:54,276 --> 01:55:56,318
He had no destiny of power or life line.

1704
01:55:56,401 --> 01:56:00,196
The figure decided there will not be
changed by your arrogance, stupid fellow.

1705
01:56:00,276 --> 01:56:01,276
Hey!

1706
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:06,276
An eye for an eye. A stab for a stab.
Death for death.

1707
01:56:06,401 --> 01:56:08,693
Let me show you how death is.
Come.

1708
01:56:25,732 --> 01:56:31,776
Hey! Not only can the gun in your hand
but even a match stick can decide death.

1709
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:37,151
Your screams in fear for life should
make the dead bodies dance.

1710
01:56:37,276 --> 01:56:38,943
See
- No, no.

1711
01:57:00,526 --> 01:57:02,776
Order...order...order...

1712
01:57:03,234 --> 01:57:08,943
Thota Ramireddy had made an indiscriminate
attack killing eight people.

1713
01:57:09,026 --> 01:57:11,276
It is proved with evidence that.

1714
01:57:11,693 --> 01:57:14,613
His 16 henchmen
who assisted him in this are sentenced

1715
01:57:14,693 --> 01:57:17,901
3 years of rigorous imprisonment.

1716
01:57:18,568 --> 01:57:20,818
As the allegations
leveled against Narasimha.

1717
01:57:21,026 --> 01:57:25,443
Could not be proved he
is ordered to be released.

1718
01:57:26,109 --> 01:57:30,026
For brutally killing so many people,
the accused Thota Rami Reddy.

1719
01:57:30,217 --> 01:57:36,526
Sentenced to be hanged until
dead as per the IPC section 302.

1720
01:57:41,318 --> 01:57:44,443
Dad! I have kept the sambar powder
and the rasam powder ready in the kitchen.

1721
01:57:44,526 --> 01:57:46,693
It will be two weeks by the time
I come back. Daily you...

1722
01:57:46,776 --> 01:57:48,526
You leave your job, dear.

1723
01:57:49,135 --> 01:57:51,068
Why dad?
- I've decided to get you married.

1724
01:57:51,526 --> 01:57:54,401
Why right now...Your age is not visible..

1725
01:57:55,276 --> 01:57:59,579
But my age is running out.
Call up Narasimha and ask him to come.

1726
01:58:13,443 --> 01:58:16,443
Brother's marriage! Gowri's marriage!

1727
01:58:16,693 --> 01:58:19,276
Hey! Keep it slow.
- Really? Enough?

1728
01:58:22,163 --> 01:58:24,776
I know about every student
who studied under me.

1729
01:58:26,823 --> 01:58:27,943
Including you.

1730
01:58:29,943 --> 01:58:32,693
Each time you greeted me
I said I didn't recognize you.

1731
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:35,526
Do you know why? Your character...

1732
01:58:36,996 --> 01:58:38,443
Narasimha!

1733
01:58:39,276 --> 01:58:43,238
Except the hunting lion where is the man
in you who can live with others?

1734
01:58:43,318 --> 01:58:45,693
Dad!
- I know, dear. I know.

1735
01:58:46,401 --> 01:58:48,401
I know that you are friends
from childhood.

1736
01:58:48,568 --> 01:58:50,026
But do you know why I did not stop?

1737
01:58:50,193 --> 01:58:53,151
Both are kids without a mother.
I thought it would stop at friendship.

1738
01:58:53,693 --> 01:58:55,443
But it has come this far.

1739
01:58:56,315 --> 01:58:58,109
It is not wrong to love, dear.

1740
01:58:58,526 --> 01:59:01,026
But what sort of person we love
is important.

1741
01:59:01,276 --> 01:59:04,693
Only parents have that
kind of responsibility.

1742
01:59:05,318 --> 01:59:09,443
What, dear? In spite of knowing about him,
do you want to marry him?

1743
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:11,443
Don't you know he is a rowdy?

1744
01:59:12,026 --> 01:59:14,693
Don't you know he gets into trouble?
Don't you know he can kill?

1745
01:59:15,276 --> 01:59:17,401
Marrying him, will you live with him.

1746
01:59:17,568 --> 01:59:18,943
Or protect him and keep a watch?

1747
01:59:19,026 --> 01:59:20,943
He punishes those who wrong.

1748
01:59:21,318 --> 01:59:24,488
But he will never do anything wrong, dad.
- Oho! Who is he to punish?

1749
01:59:24,568 --> 01:59:26,443
Is he a policeman in khaki uniform?

1750
01:59:26,901 --> 01:59:28,693
Or is he a judge in a court?

1751
01:59:29,276 --> 01:59:31,276
Or is he God to decide good and bad?

1752
01:59:31,591 --> 01:59:33,454
After all, he is a street rowdy.

1753
01:59:33,534 --> 01:59:35,988
I too have been advising him
to give it up, dad.

1754
01:59:36,068 --> 01:59:38,151
He won't give up. He cannot...

1755
01:59:38,318 --> 01:59:41,693
Once he rides a tiger and tries
to get off, the same tiger will kill him.

1756
01:59:42,776 --> 01:59:45,693
Be a rowdy for a couple of days
and let him give up the knife.

1757
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:48,693
The knife itself will cut his throat.
- Dad!

1758
01:59:50,526 --> 01:59:54,276
Yes, dear? Is it hard even to hear?

1759
01:59:55,401 --> 01:59:58,526
If that really happens, what would I do?

1760
01:59:59,568 --> 02:00:01,901
I want to perform your wedding.

1761
02:00:02,693 --> 02:00:05,318
But I cannot bear to see you as a widow.

1762
02:00:06,318 --> 02:00:09,151
The yellow thread in
the neck is not to worship

1763
02:00:10,025 --> 02:00:12,276
But to live happily together.

1764
02:00:13,127 --> 02:00:15,276
If the enmity behind you spells death.

1765
02:00:15,463 --> 02:00:17,693
Its result will be the
death of two more people.

1766
02:00:18,047 --> 02:00:19,276
Can you stop it?

1767
02:00:19,693 --> 02:00:21,943
Death will be after you every minute.

1768
02:00:22,276 --> 02:00:24,151
It will keep haunting you.

1769
02:00:24,693 --> 02:00:27,151
The day you are in danger, none of the
people you saved would stand behind you.

1770
02:00:27,276 --> 02:00:28,568
It won't happen that way, dad.

1771
02:00:29,062 --> 02:00:31,071
Do you know how much respect
he enjoys here?

1772
02:00:31,151 --> 02:00:33,693
Do you know how many people
salute him?

1773
02:00:33,943 --> 02:00:35,693
They salute many people, dear.

1774
02:00:36,068 --> 02:00:42,401
They salute to power, for necessity, for
money, with fear, to use the other fellow.

1775
02:00:42,943 --> 02:00:44,526
That is not salutation.

1776
02:00:45,318 --> 02:00:48,818
The one who salutes should see
God in the person before him.

1777
02:00:49,651 --> 02:00:52,818
The one who receives it should
possess a mountainous virtue.

1778
02:00:53,526 --> 02:00:55,276
Greeting such a person is salutation.

1779
02:00:55,443 --> 02:00:57,526
Why would they salute to him?

1780
02:01:00,193 --> 02:01:04,818
I can join my hands to ask him
for my daughter's well being.

1781
02:01:05,193 --> 02:01:07,446
Shall I do that?
- Sir! You are my teacher, sir.

1782
02:01:07,526 --> 02:01:09,693
I may be your teacher.

1783
02:01:10,276 --> 02:01:12,026
But I am an ordinary man.

1784
02:01:12,443 --> 02:01:13,776
And a girl's father.

1785
02:01:14,151 --> 02:01:18,443
For the sin of loving you, my daughter
may weep for a few days for leaving you.

1786
02:01:18,822 --> 02:01:21,943
But if she marries you,
she will weep her whole life.

1787
02:01:22,276 --> 02:01:25,693
I cannot cry seeing that. I can only die.

1788
02:01:26,193 --> 02:01:30,568
Here! If you really love my daughter
you will wish for her wellbeing, right?

1789
02:01:33,234 --> 02:01:34,651
Narasimha!

1790
02:01:35,693 --> 02:01:38,109
Master! Move aside. Gowri, go in.

1791
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:40,526
Hey stop!

1792
02:01:42,818 --> 02:01:44,026
Stop!

1793
02:01:44,443 --> 02:01:45,330
Brother.

1794
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:46,276
Narasimha!

1795
02:01:46,401 --> 02:01:48,776
Where are you going?
To die with him?

1796
02:01:48,943 --> 02:01:51,943
I've been telling for so long
and he did it in minutes. Come inside!

1797
02:01:52,026 --> 02:01:53,026
Narasimha!

1798
02:01:54,249 --> 02:01:56,040
I don't want Gowri, man.

1799
02:01:56,803 --> 02:01:59,553
I shouldn't be marrying her.

1800
02:02:00,183 --> 02:02:01,853
Whatever Master said was right.

1801
02:02:01,933 --> 02:02:04,228
Brother! Three pegs are already over.
Enough for now.

1802
02:02:04,308 --> 02:02:07,016
Only after three pegs will
the truth come out.

1803
02:02:10,141 --> 02:02:12,933
I like her since our childhood.

1804
02:02:13,808 --> 02:02:15,641
Gowri is my life.

1805
02:02:16,933 --> 02:02:18,683
There is no me without her.

1806
02:02:19,266 --> 02:02:22,141
But even without me
she should be happy, man.

1807
02:02:22,266 --> 02:02:24,183
What is it, brother? Do you fear
something might happen to you?

1808
02:02:24,266 --> 02:02:25,766
Fear? Me?

1809
02:02:26,891 --> 02:02:30,433
No matter how many come,
who has the guts to stab me?

1810
02:02:31,141 --> 02:02:34,016
If they come from behind like eunuchs,
how can we stop them?

1811
02:02:35,641 --> 02:02:38,600
There is no architecture for death.
It can come from any direction.

1812
02:02:38,850 --> 02:02:40,266
After that, what about Gowri?

1813
02:02:41,578 --> 02:02:42,891
Ah! She should not lead such a life.

1814
02:02:43,891 --> 02:02:45,391
She should always be smiling.

1815
02:02:45,683 --> 02:02:49,933
So? Just because Master asked you,
can you live without Gowri?

1816
02:02:50,016 --> 02:02:52,558
I have been living all
these years with Gowri.

1817
02:02:53,225 --> 02:02:54,641
Right here.

1818
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:56,516
I will continue to live holding
her here.

1819
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:59,141
Shekhar who used to sit here

1820
02:02:59,641 --> 02:03:02,433
And Vijay who used to sit
there are not here today.

1821
02:03:02,725 --> 02:03:05,308
At least let Gowri,
who is here, be safe.

1822
02:03:05,391 --> 02:03:06,891
So you will sacrifice your love?

1823
02:03:07,016 --> 02:03:09,558
Wishing her to stay happy
isn't that love?

1824
02:03:09,891 --> 02:03:11,641
Even if I die, my love won't.

1825
02:03:11,766 --> 02:03:13,683
You don't understand your pain. We can.

1826
02:03:14,308 --> 02:03:16,433
Don't leave Gowri. I bow to you.

1827
02:03:16,516 --> 02:03:19,016
No, bro. I saw many
salutations like this.

1828
02:03:19,766 --> 02:03:21,683
Master told me something.

1829
02:03:22,058 --> 02:03:26,516
The one who receives the
salute should be like God.

1830
02:03:27,058 --> 02:03:29,561
I am not God. I am a rowdy.

1831
02:03:29,641 --> 02:03:32,266
Crap! Let's go.
- Where shall we go?

1832
02:03:32,808 --> 02:03:36,141
Shall we eliminate Ramireddy's men
who attacked from behind?

1833
02:03:36,308 --> 02:03:39,683
Hey! Ramireddy's gang is in jail.
They may not be the ones who attacked.

1834
02:03:39,933 --> 02:03:43,308
I have my doubts on the medical company.
- How can they be so daring?

1835
02:03:43,433 --> 02:03:45,516
It must be somebody else.
- Who else can it be?

1836
02:03:45,641 --> 02:03:47,516
Moreover such bold...
- What does matter who?

1837
02:03:47,641 --> 02:03:49,933
I am travelling on a dangerous boat.

1838
02:03:50,891 --> 02:03:53,016
Gowri should not be on
that journey.

1839
02:03:53,891 --> 02:03:56,516
Yes. Master is right. Master is right.

1840
02:03:57,266 --> 02:03:59,016
Master is right.

1841
02:04:08,641 --> 02:04:09,933
Come Mr. Purushotham.

1842
02:04:10,308 --> 02:04:12,141
What is it? Vehicle repair?
- No, Narasimha.

1843
02:04:12,308 --> 02:04:14,766
Someone complained against you.
- Complaint? Who?

1844
02:04:23,183 --> 02:04:24,016
Greetings, Master.

1845
02:04:24,266 --> 02:04:25,478
Had you sent word,
I would have come myself.

1846
02:04:25,558 --> 02:04:27,141
Hey! Bring the chair.
- Not necessary.

1847
02:04:27,391 --> 02:04:28,933
If you send my daughter
I will take her with me.

1848
02:04:29,016 --> 02:04:30,308
Your daughter?
- Yes, Narasimha.

1849
02:04:30,391 --> 02:04:32,433
He gave a complaint that
you kidnapped his daughter.

1850
02:04:32,516 --> 02:04:33,978
I told him you wouldn't do it.
But he doesn't believe.

1851
02:04:34,058 --> 02:04:35,266
How can I believe? Inspector!

1852
02:04:35,769 --> 02:04:37,933
Do your duty properly.
Why are you backing him?

1853
02:04:38,141 --> 02:04:39,933
No one will come near
my daughter except him.

1854
02:04:40,558 --> 02:04:42,933
What, man? Don't you understand
however I explain?

1855
02:04:43,558 --> 02:04:46,433
Do you plan to marry my daughter
kidnapping her with all your rowdyism?

1856
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:48,558
It won't happen as long as
I am alive.

1857
02:04:48,891 --> 02:04:50,766
I don't know anything. Don't worry.

1858
02:04:50,891 --> 02:04:53,308
Nothing will happen to Gowri.
- He is pretending, Inspector.

1859
02:04:53,641 --> 02:04:56,516
Hey! Who can plan to harm Gowri?

1860
02:05:04,391 --> 02:05:07,558
Master! Your daughter will be home
by the evening.

1861
02:05:07,641 --> 02:05:08,558
You go bravely.

1862
02:05:09,766 --> 02:05:11,933
Sir, Narasimha does what he promises.

1863
02:05:12,141 --> 02:05:13,891
He never promises
what he cannot do. Come.

1864
02:05:14,557 --> 02:05:16,808
Here! If my daughter is not home
before evening...

1865
02:05:17,641 --> 02:05:19,683
You will find my dead body
in front of your house.

1866
02:05:22,766 --> 02:05:24,308
Where is Gowri?
- I don't know, brother.

1867
02:05:24,641 --> 02:05:26,683
What did you do to her?
- I don't know brother.

1868
02:05:27,516 --> 02:05:30,766
Brother! Actually...
- Tell me.

1869
02:05:32,141 --> 02:05:33,478
What did you do to her?
- Stop it, brother.

1870
02:05:33,558 --> 02:05:34,728
How much ever you hit,
Gowri will not come.

1871
02:05:34,808 --> 02:05:36,933
She will come only
if you promise to marry her.

1872
02:05:47,266 --> 02:05:49,016
I know how to make Gowri come.

1873
02:05:58,641 --> 02:06:00,308
What?
- What, what?

1874
02:06:01,458 --> 02:06:02,418
Don't beat me man...

1875
02:07:06,058 --> 02:07:07,641
They didn't kidnap me, Narasimha.

1876
02:07:08,516 --> 02:07:09,516
I came willingly.

1877
02:07:10,933 --> 02:07:12,808
You know very well why.

1878
02:07:13,641 --> 02:07:16,016
But you wanted something else.

1879
02:07:18,516 --> 02:07:23,016
You have a tiny hope that someday my dad
would understand his daughter's heart.

1880
02:07:24,266 --> 02:07:26,016
You did not give up love.

1881
02:07:26,808 --> 02:07:28,100
You killed it, Narasimha.

1882
02:07:30,516 --> 02:07:32,641
Anyways, all the best.

1883
02:07:33,683 --> 02:07:35,016
Wish you a happy married life.

1884
02:07:38,433 --> 02:07:39,766
Why do you weep, dear?

1885
02:07:40,141 --> 02:07:42,933
You found a husband
who will never let you cry.

1886
02:07:44,391 --> 02:07:45,475
Stay blessed.

1887
02:07:53,641 --> 02:07:54,433
Narasimha!

1888
02:07:55,016 --> 02:07:58,016
I thought I wouldn't live a day
without thinking of you.

1889
02:07:58,391 --> 02:08:02,433
But now there is nothing left
except hatred for you.

1890
02:08:03,516 --> 02:08:05,350
You've killed my heart.

1891
02:08:06,141 --> 02:08:09,641
Thanks. I will never see
your face in my life.

1892
02:09:09,516 --> 02:09:10,950
Who is that?

1893
02:09:12,521 --> 02:09:13,890
Oh! Cat!

1894
02:09:15,021 --> 02:09:17,183
I've to sleep, it's late.

1895
02:09:31,266 --> 02:09:32,850
Who is sleeping there?

1896
02:09:33,282 --> 02:09:34,933
Gowri?

1897
02:09:38,484 --> 02:09:39,667
Manga...

1898
02:09:40,005 --> 02:09:41,311
Manga...

1899
02:09:41,391 --> 02:09:42,641
Manga...
- Owner sir!

1900
02:09:46,433 --> 02:09:47,910
Owner sir!

1901
02:09:50,308 --> 02:09:51,311
What?

1902
02:09:51,391 --> 02:09:52,728
Didn't you call me?

1903
02:09:52,808 --> 02:09:56,728
Oh, my. I will never call you
Manga in future.

1904
02:09:56,808 --> 02:09:58,933
Owner Sir, shall I change
my name owner sir?

1905
02:09:59,016 --> 02:10:00,641
Am I still an owner?

1906
02:10:00,891 --> 02:10:01,978
Now, you are husband.

1907
02:10:02,058 --> 02:10:03,872
Owner sir then...

1908
02:10:04,141 --> 02:10:05,728
Owner husband...

1909
02:10:05,808 --> 02:10:07,436
Husband owner...

1910
02:10:07,516 --> 02:10:08,641
Move...

1911
02:11:41,933 --> 02:11:43,641
It seems Gowri got married, brother.

1912
02:11:44,433 --> 02:11:46,683
Is the groom a good person?
- Who knows?

1913
02:11:47,266 --> 02:11:50,266
He must be a good man.
She should always be happy.

1914
02:11:50,948 --> 02:11:52,016
That is what I want.

1915
02:11:54,016 --> 02:11:56,433
Manga...
- Owner sir!

1916
02:12:57,933 --> 02:13:00,183
One minute...It seems
Gowri is pregnant.

1917
02:13:02,766 --> 02:13:05,058
It happened as I wished.
- What did you wish for?

1918
02:13:06,058 --> 02:13:07,516
I wanted her to always be happy.

1919
02:13:08,391 --> 02:13:09,680
That is what I want.

1920
02:13:10,266 --> 02:13:13,016
Manga. Control yourself.
I am your everything from now.

1921
02:13:13,433 --> 02:13:14,891
Don't feel bad, Manga.

1922
02:14:21,683 --> 02:14:22,683
Owner sir!

1923
02:14:23,433 --> 02:14:24,516
Manga! What happened?

1924
02:14:24,683 --> 02:14:26,933
Time...
- It is 5 now.

1925
02:14:28,308 --> 02:14:31,266
It's delivery time. Where are we?

1926
02:14:31,808 --> 02:14:34,391
We will reach Vizag in another five,
ten minutes. Please bear a little, Manga.

1927
02:14:34,516 --> 02:14:36,032
Ok, husband.

1928
02:14:40,052 --> 02:14:42,641
Sorry. Sorry Manga.

1929
02:14:48,183 --> 02:14:50,353
Why are you looking at me and smiling?

1930
02:14:50,433 --> 02:14:52,391
Our baby should look like you.

1931
02:14:53,766 --> 02:14:54,682
Hey!

1932
02:15:13,766 --> 02:15:15,120
Manga!

1933
02:15:16,433 --> 02:15:17,789
Manga!

1934
02:15:18,058 --> 02:15:19,891
Manga! Manga!

1935
02:15:46,683 --> 02:15:48,603
Excuse me! Don't disturb her much.

1936
02:15:48,683 --> 02:15:50,641
Just meet her and come.
I need to talk to you.

1937
02:15:53,516 --> 02:15:55,811
Her head received a serious blow
and a lot of blood is lost.

1938
02:15:55,891 --> 02:15:57,686
She has to be under observation
for 24 hours.

1939
02:15:57,766 --> 02:15:59,641
Shift her to the ICU immediately.

1940
02:15:59,766 --> 02:16:01,183
Ok, sir. Fine sir.
- No

1941
02:16:01,558 --> 02:16:02,933
It will be painful from now on.

1942
02:16:03,788 --> 02:16:04,768
What are you saying?

1943
02:16:05,141 --> 02:16:08,808
How to handle three boys?

1944
02:16:09,683 --> 02:16:10,308
Three?

1945
02:16:11,016 --> 02:16:14,433
Hey! One...two...three.

1946
02:16:14,516 --> 02:16:18,766
Oh! You added me too?
Am I a baby? Hey!

1947
02:16:20,308 --> 02:16:22,978
Owner sir! I have a wish.

1948
02:16:23,058 --> 02:16:24,016
Tell me, at least now.

1949
02:16:24,141 --> 02:16:26,308
How many times I asked you
don't you have any wishes?

1950
02:16:26,391 --> 02:16:27,516
You always say no.

1951
02:16:27,641 --> 02:16:30,683
Even now, it is not for me.
It is for our children.

1952
02:16:30,933 --> 02:16:31,808
What is it? Tell me.

1953
02:16:31,933 --> 02:16:34,766
We don't know what problem
comes from whom.

1954
02:16:35,016 --> 02:16:37,266
Let us leave this place.

1955
02:16:37,808 --> 02:16:42,141
We will go to some other place and
bring up the children well.

1956
02:16:42,555 --> 02:16:45,308
Please, owner sir...
what are you thinking?

1957
02:16:45,516 --> 02:16:49,766
We can live happily
anywhere with your skill.

1958
02:16:49,891 --> 02:16:52,391
What do you say?
- Will you fulfill my wish?

1959
02:16:54,683 --> 02:16:58,016
Ok, Manga. We will go.
We will do as you wish, ok?

1960
02:17:00,058 --> 02:17:02,808
Why do you look at me like that?
I said ok.

1961
02:17:08,516 --> 02:17:09,752
Manga!

1962
02:17:10,558 --> 02:17:11,458
Manga!

1963
02:17:11,808 --> 02:17:12,811
Manga!

1964
02:17:12,891 --> 02:17:14,391
Doctor!

1965
02:17:37,808 --> 02:17:39,281
Manga!

1966
02:17:47,433 --> 02:17:49,179
Manga!

1967
02:17:52,152 --> 02:17:53,723
Sorry, sir.

1968
02:18:26,016 --> 02:18:27,185
No,

1969
02:18:27,433 --> 02:18:28,686
what are you saying doctor?

1970
02:18:28,766 --> 02:18:30,766
The baby has been dead in the
womb for two days.

1971
02:18:31,272 --> 02:18:33,766
There is infection and so we had
to remove the uterus.

1972
02:18:33,846 --> 02:18:35,100
Oh no...

1973
02:18:35,891 --> 02:18:37,766
What a terrible thing to do, Doctor?

1974
02:18:38,266 --> 02:18:40,225
My daughter is very fond of children.

1975
02:18:41,058 --> 02:18:43,936
If she knows she won't become a mother,
she will die doctor!

1976
02:18:44,016 --> 02:18:46,016
If the uterus was not removed,
she would have died.

1977
02:18:46,766 --> 02:18:49,308
That's why we had to.
Please understand sir.

1978
02:18:49,802 --> 02:18:50,891
Doctor!

1979
02:18:53,016 --> 02:18:54,549
Oh, God!

1980
02:19:08,558 --> 02:19:10,683
Nurse! Doctor!

1981
02:19:12,641 --> 02:19:13,891
Where is my baby?

1982
02:19:15,308 --> 02:19:17,141
Nurse...dad!

1983
02:19:17,308 --> 02:19:18,558
Oh, God!

1984
02:19:18,891 --> 02:19:20,183
Where is my baby dad?

1985
02:19:20,426 --> 02:19:22,115
Here, sir.

1986
02:19:24,891 --> 02:19:27,391
This is a God sent boon
seeing your grief.

1987
02:19:27,683 --> 02:19:28,558
What are you saying?

1988
02:19:28,641 --> 02:19:31,683
Yes, sir. A man had twins
in the same hospital.

1989
02:19:32,266 --> 02:19:35,766
But his wife died.

1990
02:19:36,683 --> 02:19:41,058
He didn't want to see your grief
and your daughter's tears.

1991
02:19:44,016 --> 02:19:46,641
Who is that guy?
- He told not to tell his name.

1992
02:19:47,183 --> 02:19:51,516
He told not to inform your daughter
and take care of this child.

1993
02:19:52,673 --> 02:19:53,808
Where is he now?

1994
02:19:53,891 --> 02:19:57,516
He just went to the ambulance
with his wife's dead body sir.

1995
02:20:11,433 --> 02:20:13,129
Narasimha!

1996
02:20:23,266 --> 02:20:26,266
Dear, dear.
The baby is with me, dear.

1997
02:20:26,558 --> 02:20:28,516
The doctor called me and
so I took him out..

1998
02:20:32,132 --> 02:20:33,141
Father.

1999
02:21:34,194 --> 02:21:35,891
Drive me to Kumbhakonam, fast.

2000
02:21:38,915 --> 02:21:41,868
Don't be naughty, child.
Stand straight.

2001
02:21:41,948 --> 02:21:43,576
Where should I keep
young madam's suitcase?

2002
02:21:43,656 --> 02:21:44,698
Keep it on my head.

2003
02:21:45,531 --> 02:21:47,281
Hey... hey... hey...

2004
02:21:47,531 --> 02:21:48,448
Hold him a little tight.

2005
02:21:48,531 --> 02:21:51,198
What is this, madam?
You are going abroad all of a sudden?

2006
02:21:51,281 --> 02:21:53,826
It seems if she joins again
she will get some yellow or green card.

2007
02:21:53,906 --> 02:21:55,573
Is there a better property, prestige
and prosperity than here?

2008
02:21:55,656 --> 02:21:57,243
Why should you work
there with so much here?

2009
02:21:57,323 --> 02:21:58,198
Destiny, man.

2010
02:21:58,955 --> 02:21:59,781
Destiny.

2011
02:22:00,281 --> 02:22:03,156
Those who should be here
and enjoy are going away.

2012
02:22:03,448 --> 02:22:05,781
Those who are supposed
to go away are here enjoying.

2013
02:22:06,781 --> 02:22:08,906
What does he have? What do I lack?

2014
02:22:09,031 --> 02:22:13,198
He has personality and
you have municipality.

2015
02:22:14,948 --> 02:22:17,198
I will show you my personality.

2016
02:22:17,448 --> 02:22:19,201
You should call me every day.
- Yes, dad.

2017
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:20,993
You must send a whatsapp message daily.
- Ok.

2018
02:22:21,073 --> 02:22:23,031
Don't drive rashly.
- Yes.

2019
02:22:23,156 --> 02:22:25,823
Bye everybody.
- Go carefully, dear.

2020
02:22:26,406 --> 02:22:27,461
Mom!

2021
02:22:29,156 --> 02:22:32,323
Shanti! When she is leaving,
send her off with a smile.

2022
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:33,618
Why the tears?

2023
02:22:33,698 --> 02:22:37,031
I thought you will get her married off
and send her this time.

2024
02:22:37,406 --> 02:22:38,531
Don't worry, mom.

2025
02:22:38,948 --> 02:22:41,906
I speak the truth.
I will never do anything wrong.

2026
02:22:42,073 --> 02:22:46,573
I will marry someone who will stand by me
in my troubles and who you approve of.

2027
02:22:47,031 --> 02:22:48,576
Swear on you. Ok?

2028
02:22:48,656 --> 02:22:50,698
Do you understand what young madam
is talking about?

2029
02:22:50,781 --> 02:22:52,406
About whom?
- About brother.

2030
02:22:53,031 --> 02:22:53,823
About brother?

2031
02:22:53,948 --> 02:22:57,823
That is Narasimha Brother.
She says that indirectly.

2032
02:22:58,906 --> 02:23:00,381
I will accompany you
to the airport, sir.

2033
02:23:00,461 --> 02:23:01,883
I will miss you so much, cutie pie.
- No, Narasimha.

2034
02:23:01,963 --> 02:23:03,993
By the time you return
from Chennai it will be very late.

2035
02:23:04,073 --> 02:23:04,906
The boy will cry.

2036
02:23:05,031 --> 02:23:06,573
When he is with his aunt,
he never cries.

2037
02:23:06,656 --> 02:23:07,993
Who is aunt?
- Devi.

2038
02:23:08,073 --> 02:23:09,118
She will take care of him.

2039
02:23:09,198 --> 02:23:10,406
Let it be Narasimha.
- Bye.

2040
02:23:12,849 --> 02:23:14,656
Say ta-da aunty!
- Bye-bye!

2041
02:23:18,156 --> 02:23:20,656
Narasimha! Hit me here.

2042
02:23:20,906 --> 02:23:22,573
Any sense in what you talk?

2043
02:23:22,656 --> 02:23:24,781
I am asking you to slap me. Do it.

2044
02:23:30,198 --> 02:23:31,281
I am not able to hear.

2045
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:35,531
Someone like me deserves this punishment.
There has to be.

2046
02:23:39,531 --> 02:23:44,531
What man, not a single police or security
in the central minister's guest house?

2047
02:23:46,156 --> 02:23:47,073
Minister Sir!

2048
02:23:47,906 --> 02:23:48,698
Minister Sir!

2049
02:23:50,198 --> 02:23:51,031
I am here.

2050
02:23:51,531 --> 02:23:52,451
Upstairs.

2051
02:23:52,531 --> 02:23:55,073
What sir?
Why are you sitting alone here?

2052
02:23:55,281 --> 02:23:56,701
Is there a large amount
to be transferred?

2053
02:23:56,781 --> 02:23:57,823
Why did you send for me?

2054
02:23:57,906 --> 02:24:00,281
I have some work for you in Kumbhakonam.
- Tell me, Sir.

2055
02:24:00,406 --> 02:24:02,406
Would I ever refuse to work for you?
- Not for me.

2056
02:24:02,656 --> 02:24:03,698
Then for whom?

2057
02:24:09,406 --> 02:24:11,781
Wherever this man is in Kumbhakonam.

2058
02:24:12,406 --> 02:24:14,823
You must present him before me.

2059
02:24:16,823 --> 02:24:17,519
Why?

2060
02:24:17,599 --> 02:24:19,948
If my son's soul should find peace.

2061
02:24:20,754 --> 02:24:22,906
Two people must die immediately.

2062
02:24:23,448 --> 02:24:29,656
One is this fellow.
The other is that one.

2063
02:24:30,031 --> 02:24:33,618
Not only to you.
This man is my enemy too.

2064
02:24:33,698 --> 02:24:37,698
I will transfer my crores of rupees
in your name.

2065
02:24:37,781 --> 02:24:40,118
Bring him before me.

2066
02:24:40,198 --> 02:24:41,406
He is a lion.

2067
02:24:41,823 --> 02:24:43,531
It is not easy to capture him.

2068
02:24:43,781 --> 02:24:45,656
If he enters the arena, we will die.

2069
02:24:46,448 --> 02:24:48,031
We should kill him in a cage.

2070
02:24:48,156 --> 02:24:50,823
We should make him
walk into the cage.

2071
02:25:03,968 --> 02:25:05,489
Hello... constable how are you?

2072
02:25:05,698 --> 02:25:08,198
Kanniyappa's men hit me.

2073
02:25:08,660 --> 02:25:12,573
And abducted the ASP along with
his wife and son.

2074
02:25:12,656 --> 02:25:14,743
Before going Kanniyappan
came close and said....

2075
02:25:14,823 --> 02:25:16,156
You are Narasimha's man, right?

2076
02:25:16,448 --> 02:25:18,156
Call him up and tell him.

2077
02:25:18,698 --> 02:25:21,698
If he comes to the Cuddallore shipyard
in half an hour.

2078
02:25:21,936 --> 02:25:26,031
He can see the ASP's family alive.

2079
02:25:31,823 --> 02:25:36,448
Hey, look. First your wife
and then your son.

2080
02:25:36,698 --> 02:25:40,698
I will then beat you to death
as you sob over them.

2081
02:25:41,526 --> 02:25:42,531
Do you know something?

2082
02:25:42,698 --> 02:25:44,531
I am not killing your wife.

2083
02:25:44,656 --> 02:25:49,656
The one who warned me he would behead me
if I touch your family...Narasimha...

2084
02:25:49,781 --> 02:25:51,031
He will kill..

2085
02:26:00,573 --> 02:26:01,323
Come.

2086
02:26:29,698 --> 02:26:30,698
Close the doors.

2087
02:26:30,906 --> 02:26:34,531
Set him ablaze with petrol
along with the container.

2088
02:26:35,781 --> 02:26:36,531
What woman!

2089
02:26:36,698 --> 02:26:38,743
Are you happy you missed death?

2090
02:26:38,823 --> 02:26:40,531
Not happiness, man. Sorrow.

2091
02:26:41,031 --> 02:26:44,031
I am sad I am dying at the hands
of one who is neither man nor woman.

2092
02:26:45,156 --> 02:26:47,281
I wanted to kill you in front of
your husband.

2093
02:26:48,156 --> 02:26:49,031
But small change.

2094
02:26:49,906 --> 02:26:52,906
I will kill your husband and
your son in front of you.

2095
02:26:53,656 --> 02:26:55,781
Then I will prove to you I am a man.

2096
02:26:56,406 --> 02:26:58,281
Hey! Tie her up.

2097
02:27:19,406 --> 02:27:23,448
Hey, it should be crushed to pulp.
Don't miss.

2098
02:28:24,698 --> 02:28:27,198
Thank you, Narasimha.
You saved us a second time.

2099
02:28:33,906 --> 02:28:35,337
Son!

2100
02:29:56,593 --> 02:29:57,815
Go inside.

2101
02:30:16,656 --> 02:30:18,156
Hey! Narasimha!

2102
02:30:19,281 --> 02:30:21,906
I will not die until I see you dead.

2103
02:30:34,781 --> 02:30:35,698
Hey! Thota!

2104
02:30:36,281 --> 02:30:38,368
To kill a lion you need training.

2105
02:30:38,448 --> 02:30:40,906
To kill Narasimha you need timing.

2106
02:30:44,809 --> 02:30:46,406
My time is good.

2107
02:30:46,823 --> 02:30:48,118
Your death is confirmed.

2108
02:30:48,198 --> 02:30:51,031
What decides that is not mouth
but power.

2109
02:31:45,406 --> 02:31:48,156
You can cheat the court
but not the God.

2110
02:32:08,165 --> 02:32:09,298
Gowri!

2111
02:32:29,536 --> 02:32:30,721
Gowri!

2112
02:32:34,823 --> 02:32:37,448
Doctor! What are you saying?

2113
02:32:38,406 --> 02:32:40,698
We could save those
with bullets in the body.

2114
02:32:41,323 --> 02:32:44,948
We couldn't save those
with head injury.

2115
02:32:45,906 --> 02:32:46,650
Sorry.

2116
02:33:01,489 --> 02:33:02,781
My precious!

2117
02:33:04,281 --> 02:33:05,948
Did you leave me and go?

2118
02:33:07,531 --> 02:33:12,656
Is your hundred years of life
nipped in the bud?

2119
02:33:13,906 --> 02:33:16,531
How will I convey this
to your mother?

2120
02:33:19,531 --> 02:33:22,198
Sorry, sir. Your daughter
lost a lot of blood.

2121
02:33:22,698 --> 02:33:27,239
Please let her not know of
this for two to three days.

2122
02:33:35,656 --> 02:33:36,406
Doctor!

2123
02:33:38,156 --> 02:33:38,781
Nurse!

2124
02:33:46,893 --> 02:33:48,156
Doctor!
- Dear.

2125
02:33:48,656 --> 02:33:50,406
I am here.
- Where is my son?

2126
02:33:51,281 --> 02:33:53,031
How is he? How is my husband?

2127
02:33:53,156 --> 02:33:56,656
He is fine. A small surgery.
He is under observation.

2128
02:33:56,781 --> 02:33:58,823
Dad! I must see my kid.
- You take some rest, dear.

2129
02:33:58,948 --> 02:34:00,698
Otherwise I won't have peace.

2130
02:34:00,823 --> 02:34:03,406
Already the doctors are attending to him.
- Dad... please!

2131
02:34:03,785 --> 02:34:06,281
You lost a lot of blood.
You must take rest.

2132
02:34:06,531 --> 02:34:09,156
It is fine even if I die, dad.
I must see my son now.

2133
02:34:28,656 --> 02:34:29,771
Son!

2134
02:34:39,149 --> 02:34:41,176
Nothing happened to you, right?

2135
02:34:41,823 --> 02:34:43,378
Nothing will happen to you.

2136
02:34:51,906 --> 02:34:53,257
Narasimha!

2137
02:35:34,906 --> 02:35:36,162
Narasimha!

2138
02:35:37,781 --> 02:35:39,698
Narasimha!
I taught many children lessons.

2139
02:35:41,656 --> 02:35:44,031
But you taught me a life's lesson.
- Master!

2140
02:35:44,244 --> 02:35:46,906
What is this Master?
Why do you bow before me?

2141
02:35:47,122 --> 02:35:48,156
Narasimha!

2142
02:35:49,406 --> 02:35:53,031
I told you one has to be God
to receive salutations.

2143
02:35:53,906 --> 02:35:57,323
You appear to me as God
sacrificing so much.

2144
02:35:58,156 --> 02:35:59,781
Justice is run not on four feet.

2145
02:36:00,068 --> 02:36:02,531
It is run on the sacrifices
of the lot like you.

2146
02:36:03,243 --> 02:36:04,284
I salute you.

2147
02:36:05,156 --> 02:36:06,906
Master! You are an elder.

2148
02:36:07,527 --> 02:36:08,906
How can you fall at my feet?

2149
02:36:09,823 --> 02:36:11,656
What else can I do?

2150
02:36:11,906 --> 02:36:13,073
I need a favour.

2151
02:36:13,448 --> 02:36:15,781
I will be lucky to do it. Tell me.

2152
02:36:16,198 --> 02:36:18,156
Gowri should never know
what happened.

2153
02:36:18,781 --> 02:36:20,323
The boy must live like
her own son.

2154
02:36:22,906 --> 02:36:24,656
Do you want me to hide this truth too?

2155
02:36:25,906 --> 02:36:27,906
Narasimha,
there is a limit for sacrifice too.

2156
02:36:30,531 --> 02:36:32,448
How much will you do
for my daughter?

2157
02:36:33,998 --> 02:36:35,133
Sir!

2158
02:36:35,656 --> 02:36:37,656
Gowri cared for me like a
mother when we were small.

2159
02:36:37,906 --> 02:36:39,781
She shared her friendship with me
as a friend.

2160
02:36:39,906 --> 02:36:41,906
She gave me her heart
and inspired love in me.

2161
02:36:42,531 --> 02:36:45,404
I can give my life for
such a person, sir.

2162
02:36:45,698 --> 02:36:48,823
Isn't it what you gave her just now?
- She should always be happy.

2163
02:36:49,701 --> 02:36:51,241
That is all I want.

2164
02:36:52,656 --> 02:36:53,741
See you, Master!
