1
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,817
Give me the liqueur.

2
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,320
Do you want? - No.

3
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,688
Are you sleepy?

4
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,192
Me too.

5
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,927
Will you hear a story? - No.

6
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:33,136
So, listen. 15 days back
3 people burgled Om Jewellers.

7
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:38,512
Amar, Akbar and Anthony.

8
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,278
I gave them these names.

9
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:50,624
That day, the jeweler was
alone and now, his wife is alone.

10
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,093
Is the story over?

11
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,468
The story has now begun.

12
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,338
Listen... - Tell me.

13
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,575
Yesterday, some bad news
was being telecasted on TV.

14
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,941
My mood became off.
- You should have put off the TV.

15
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,180
Isn't there an
off button on the TV?

16
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,113
I'm thinking of buying an LCD TV.

17
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,855
Why? Doesn't bad news
seem bad on an LCD TV?

18
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,895
They were saying,
the world is going to end in 2012.

19
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,999
Is the news confirmed? - Yes,
it was being shown on TV till now.

20
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,000
Then it must be confirmed. - Yes.

21
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,296
What to do now?
- I'm thinking the same.

22
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,039
You make fun of me. You'll
realize when the world will end.

23
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,274
You'll also die when the world
will end. - That's the problem.

24
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,016
You all commit the
sin and we have to suffer.

25
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,012
Our democracy is such, brother.

26
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,285
One does and someone
else is punished.

27
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,690
What are you?
- Let's count the points.

28
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,128
He's drinking and driving
on the wrong side. Over take him.

29
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,099
Leave it, sir.
What do we have to do?

30
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,101
Why don't we have to do?
We're policemen.

31
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,403
How can this happen
in front of our eyes?

32
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,007
Overtake that imbecile.
Overtake him. Overtake him!

33
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,234
Sir, let's go straight home.

34
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,504
We've to rest for two
hours and leave at 3 o'clock.

35
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,843
You're arguing with your senior!
Order is order. Overtake him!

36
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,710
Overtake him.

37
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,519
What are you doing, sir? Sir...

38
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,128
Bhaskar... There's a lady.

39
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,870
Put down the window.

40
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,610
What is sir doing?
- Leave it. Let's play, come on.

41
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,743
I don't know to play cards.
- It's easy. It's like life.

42
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,940
You'll understand
everything once you lose.

43
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,276
Come on, hold it, hold it. Hold it.

44
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,044
The rains too have stopped.

45
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,784
Where are you coming from?

46
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,686
Where... are you going?

47
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,929
Sir, from the party.

48
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,565
Did you drink in the party?

49
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,757
Did you drink? - No, sir.

50
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,257
What do you both do?

51
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,028
Where do you stay?

52
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,194
Sir, just over...

53
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,632
By the way, madam... - Yes.

54
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,771
Did you really not drink?

55
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,934
No sir, absolutely not.
Because I knew that...

56
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,440
You went to the party
and didn't drink?

57
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,714
Sir, I didn't drink.

58
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,410
Come out.
- But what have I done, sir?

59
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,315
The policeman is standing
outside and you're sitting inside.

60
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,283
You aren't even wearing
your seat belt. Come out.

61
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,890
Come out. - I'm sorry...

62
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,048
Come out.

63
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,387
Walk straight.

64
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,490
Sir... - Come out, come. Carefully.

65
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,360
Sir... - Come, come here.

66
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,795
Sir, I didn't drink.

67
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,869
Hold it at the centre and
spread it. - I'm doing it.

68
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:50,336
Sir, please... let me go, sir. - You
go to a party and you don't drink.

69
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,136
What kind of a man are you?
- Take this and drink.

70
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,677
No, no sir. - Drink it!

71
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,846
Drink or else I'll give
you one tight slap. - Dolly.

72
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,611
Oh... What do you do?

73
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,357
I'm a marketing consultant.
- Marketing? Excellent!

74
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,961
How much do you earn
in a month? - What?

75
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,798
Will you play cards?

76
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:16,726
Take him inside.

77
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,432
Four of us will play Uno together.

78
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,368
Let it be. We'll play Rummy.

79
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,407
Sir... let me go, sir.

80
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,608
Where are you going? Have a seat.

81
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,142
We're policemen.
We're public servants.

82
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,507
I'll call for boiled
chickpeas sprinkled...

83
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,649
...with onions and a dash of lime.

84
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,877
Come, sit. Sit on my lap, come.

85
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,078
Alright, go. Take this with you.
It might be useful. - Thank you.

86
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,612
Go!

87
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,039
So... where was I?

88
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,204
Amar, Akbar, Anthony.

89
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,309
These three names... - You've given.

90
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,853
Now, at a distance of 4 kms from
Om Jewellers, Police found Amar.

91
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,824
Dead. Two bullets in the chest.
From point blank range.

92
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,557
And whom did they find
at a distance of 6 kms? - Akbar.

93
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,563
Dead. Two bullets in the chest.
From point blank range.

94
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,895
Anthony... Dead.

95
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,536
Akbar took away all
the valuables and escaped.

96
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,940
After that Amar's wife was missing.

97
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,305
Police found her photo
in Anthony's pocket.

98
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,040
Of Akbar's wife?
- No, of Amar's wife.

99
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,748
The photo was in Anthony's pocket.

100
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,286
You mean Amar's wife had
an affair with Anthony and...

101
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,188
...she ran away with Akbar? - Yes.

102
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,787
Strange story, isn't it?

103
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,161
It must be true. Life is
very complicated thing. - Yes.

104
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,127
Shall I ask you something?

105
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,202
Won't you ask if I say, no?

106
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,010
Do you know Guru Sukhdeo?

107
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,878
What did Guru Sukhdeo say?

108
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,009
He has taken a vow of silence.
He just speaks using gestures.

109
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,943
Okay. What did he
say using gestures?

110
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,314
He said,
Son, you don't take any tension.

111
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,160
Nothing will happen
to you and your mates.

112
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:28,967
Tomorrow, after the sunrise,
success will be at your feet.

113
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,361
Did he say so many things
using gestures? - Yes.

114
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,004
Really? Show me how?

115
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,107
A small bottle of liqueur...

116
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,180
You'll go to the dance
bar and become insane...

117
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,220
No, no... not like that.

118
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,426
You... You... You'll embrace someone.

119
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,588
No, no... not like that too.
Not like that.

120
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,297
Tomorrow... Tomorrow...

121
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,934
There's something
round and a finger in it!

122
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,906
You'll turn it and then... yahoo!
What the hell!

123
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,012
You... You...

124
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:22,019
...you'll go on your knees,
slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly...

125
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,453
...and kiss!

126
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,126
What was his name? - Guru Sukhdeo.

127
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,267
His name should be Kaamdev. - What?

128
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,766
My dear, he was teaching
you Kamasutra and...

129
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,908
...you were thinking something else.
- No! What are you saying?

130
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,374
You think.
Think. - How can it be Kamasutra?

131
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,184
I'm right, aren't I?

132
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,387
No!

133
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,501
Are you hungry?

134
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,873
Shakti, stop the van. He's hungry.

135
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,377
No one has the sense
of duty commitment.

136
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,685
Are we on a picnic?

137
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,551
First liqueur, then cards
and now you all are hungry.

138
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,483
Be serious at least sometimes.
We've done this our entire life!

139
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,460
At least don't insult this uniform!

140
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,099
Our life is going to
change tomorrow morning.

141
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:46,097
But, no! No one is bothered.
They will live this B grade life!

142
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,674
Okay, okay. What is this?

143
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,950
Come, sir. Come. Come, sir.

144
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,615
Are you closing the bar?

145
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,249
Sir, please shift.

146
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,153
Why are the bar girls going away?
- I don't know. No idea.

147
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,821
Have a seat, sir. Sit down.

148
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,763
Where have we come?

149
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,227
Pawar sir went, sir.

150
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,233
So... should we go away?
- No, I didn't mean that, sir.

151
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,095
Is any section applicable, sir?
- No, not now.

152
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,536
No? Will you have something
to eat and drink sir?

153
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,140
Yes, we'll eat beautiful
things and drink beautiful drinks.

154
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,300
Bring everything that
is there in the kitchen.

155
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,178
I'll send it right now, sir.

156
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,679
Is it necessary
to listen to the song?

157
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,818
A body like a sandalwood

158
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,181
Wandering mind

159
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,415
Your slow smile

160
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,025
It's a very nice place.

161
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,788
Yes, it's a very nice place.
It has a homely atmosphere.

162
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,495
Are you listening to this idiot?
- Forget him!

163
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,962
Sir, are you listening
to this idiot?

164
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,127
He's not singing from his mouth.

165
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,096
I'll have to shut him off.

166
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,866
Leave it, sir.
We'll eat and leave from here.

167
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,068
No, if he continues
to sing like this...

168
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,804
...there'll be law
and order problem here.

169
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,140
Sir, why are you creating issues?

170
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,943
Pinto, are you watching? Now,
the second scene has begun. - Yes.

171
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,210
Your slow smile

172
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:13,688
Don't blame me, world

173
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,856
If I go...

174
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,258
Do you want a bullet? - No, sir.

175
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,597
Will you go home? - Yes, sir.

176
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,126
Then go!

177
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,871
If I want,
I can arrest all of you right now.

178
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,612
Why? You tolerate
such a disgusting song.

179
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,377
You spend so much money.
You drink so many liqueurs.

180
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,609
And what do you listen?

181
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,385
We'll sing a song for you.

182
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,555
And the first to sing is...

183
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:52,129
...our Encounter Specialist,
Bhaskar Sardesai!

184
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,728
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome... - Go...

185
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,333
...the one and only... - No...

186
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,493
...Bhaskar Sardesai!
- C'mon, Bhaskar!

187
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,270
Applause.

188
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,507
Bhaskar!

189
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,471
Thank you.

190
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,012
Come, come.

191
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,746
Let the music begin!
One, two, three, four!

192
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,374
Breeze,
O breeze, spread the fragrance

193
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,911
Tell me, where is she
with her hair left loose?

194

205
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,867
Tell me, please

206
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,533
I want to meet her

Unite me with my beloved

212
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,795
Someone's face has
started glowing again

213
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,161
She found her lost beloved again

214
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,101
Someone's face has

215
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,675
She found her lost love again

Where did she find?

218
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,715
We searched the whole world

219
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,184

Only you heard it

235
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,872
Don't tell anyone
what she told you

236
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,644

What does he want?

251
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,381
Sir, look behind. - Who is it?

252
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,417
Don't stop.

253
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,388
We'll have to stop. - Why?

254
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,456
Who? - It's the police... Real one.

255
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,603
My name is Pankaj Suri.

256
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,739
Everybody calls me, 'Sir'.

257
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:05,072
I'm... I was a professor
of English at National College.

258
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,717
In fact, I was the bloody
Head of the Department.

259
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:09,979
Speak in Hindi.

260
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,882
Come inside.

261
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,352
Greetings.
My name is Pankaj Purshottam Suri.

262
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,621
I was the professor of
English at National College.

263
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:23,359
And nowadays, I'm the driver of
Balsara Choksi alias Hawala King.

264
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,071
Savita Chaudhary...

265
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,142
...was a lecturer
in Biology department.

266
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:38,339
Her anatomy was absolutely amazing.

267
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,244
There was nothing
emotional between us.

268
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,649
It wasjust physical... physical.
Just physical.

269
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,022
But wives don't
understand such things.

270
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,487
My wife came to know about us.

271
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:56,959
She was in a mood to fight...
I had taken a few drinks.

272
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,464
So, a quarrel took place
between us and... I pushed her.

273
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,433
The table was at the wrong place.
It broke.

274
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,548
And... I spent ten years in jail.

275
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:17,221
Inside the jail,
I learnt to control my anger.

276
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,385
Now, I don't get angry at all.

277
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,356
Others get angry.

278
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,241
Listen, if you drink today,
I'll shoot you.

279
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,243
Why do you speak
such things on birthday?

280
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,708
What should I speak then?
Don't you know him?

281
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:49,315
Today, no drinking, sir.
Today is his birthday.

282
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:53,185
You don't take any tension, madam.
No drinking today. You enjoy.

283
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,256
Many happy returns of the day,
Mr. Balsara. - Choksi.

284
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,301
Surprise! - Thank you.

285
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,801
Happy birthday!

286
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,737
Cut you cake! C'mon, c'mon!

287
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,208
Happy birthday to you!

288
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,183
Happy birthday to you!

289
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,282
Happy birthday...

290
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,496
Give me two sips, drunkard

291
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,291
See, what happens later

292
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,358
Give me two sips, drunkard

293
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,731
I want to have a drink,
I want to have a drink

294
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,198
I want to have a drink

295
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,499
I want to have a drink,
I want to have a drink

296
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:50,247
Mr. Choksi...
Happy birthday to you

297
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,920
Sir... Sir, I love you.

298
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,688
Party hasn't even begun and
you've already had too many drinks.

299
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,593
Sir, I met that old sage.

300
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,031
Whom did you meet?
- Your favorite old man.

301
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,634
He said, sir isn't seen today.

302
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,070
Say hello to him, sir.

303
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,244
Hello. Hello, my friend.

304
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,948
Chandu...

305
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,531
He holds my hands,
goodness gracious!

306
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,600
Tickles me, my honey!

307
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,565
He holds my hands,
goodness gracious!

308
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,967
Tickles me, my honey!

309
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,746
For you my honey

310
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,080
For you my honey

311
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,190
I became a Hookah,
I became a Beedi,

312
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,053
I became smoking pipe for you

313
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:12,253
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

314
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,059
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

315
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,227
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

316
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,046
Why don't you give me a drink?

317
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,115
Why don't you kiss me?

318
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,114
Why are you scared to touch me?

319
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,083
Tell me, my beloved.

320
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,085
My beauty isn't poisonous

321
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,019
There's intoxication
in every nerve of my body

322
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,183
With the strike
of lightning of my eyes

323
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,884
You will get burnt down

324
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,759
So, let me touch,
let whatever happens happen

325
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:51,835
Don't let the crazy
hearts gain consciousness

326
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,597
For me, my honey.

327
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,569
I became a Hookah,
I became a Beedi,

328
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,072
I became a smoking pipe for you

329
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,404
For me, my honey.

330
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,705
I became the liqueur,
I became the Marijuana

331
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,439
I became the Bhaang

332
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:08,677
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

333
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:13,085
Intoxicated, intoxicated,
you became intoxicated

334
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,600
My beloved, goodness gracious!

335
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,500
Tickles me, my honey!

336
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,732
You're like a liqueur bottle

337
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,705
You tempt me every second.

338
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:36,712
The moment I drink,
my heart gives out a sigh

339
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,782
Don't go away from me

340
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,815
Don't torment me more

341
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,647
Without two sips of the liqueur

342
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,186
I'll die

343
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,320
Let me take a sip,
let me dissolve in the whisky

344
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,623
Let me touch your lips,
let me drink its nectar

345
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,891
For me, my honey.

346
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,227
You became the liqueur,
you became the marijuana.

347
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,892
You became the Bhaang

348
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,231
For me, my honey

349
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:05,137
I became a Hookah, I became
a Beedi, I became smoke for you

350
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:09,302
Intoxicated,

00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:13,383
Intoxicated,

352
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,314
I became a Gutka - For me

353
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,352
I became a gamble - For me

354
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,581
I became a smoke pipe - For me

355
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:20,884
Tormentor, look away from me

356
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,493
I became a liqueur
bottle - For me

357
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,458
I became whisky - For me

358
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,689
I became soda - For me

359
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:28,992
Taste me a little

360
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:33,001
Don't show me your arms,
my heart will fall for you

361
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:37,039
Stay away,
this drunkard will get provoked

362
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,575
For me, my honey

363
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,236
I became a liqueur,
I became a Palm wine

364
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,508
For you, my honey

365
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,851
I became the liqueur,
I became the Marijuana

366
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,816
I became the Bhaang

367
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,856
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

368
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:57,483
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

369
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,129
For you, my honey

370
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,799
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

371
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,763
For you, my honey

372
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,835
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

373
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,561
For you, my honey

374
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,297
Intoxicated,
intoxicated, I became intoxicated

375
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,817
Where is its gear?
- It's automatic.

376
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,656
You know everything, don't you?
Whose party was it?

377
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,055
Whose birthday was it? C'mon!

378
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,954
Go! - Look... Iook, you...

379
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,329
What now? Now what?
- Why are you getting angry on me?

380
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,033
You've pampered him.

381
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,067
He teaches you English and...

382
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,366
...you run around him saying,
sir, this and sir, that.

383
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,668
He had saved your life, remember?

384
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,904
Yes, he had saved my life once
but he has killed me hundred times.

385
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,744
Mr. Choksi... - What is it?

386
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,784
Stop the car, please.
- You're my driver.

387
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,511
Will you tell me when to
stop the car and when to start?

388
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,090
I want to pee. - Hold it.

389
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,055
Stop the car for him...

390
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,260
I've to badly pee.

391
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,169
Shall I pee in this?
- This is my mug!

392
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,369
Bobby... Hi!

393
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,373
I had come here to be a singer.

394
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:28,511
I was abused, I was thrown
out and I became a singer too.

395
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,048
But... in a dance bar.

396
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,053
There I made friendship with girls.

397
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,027
And I... became the manager.

398
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,492
Say pimp... pimp.

399
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,863
In the olden days,
a manager was called as a pimp.

400
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,956
Are you aright... Madhu?

401
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,868
What will you take? Coffee?

402
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,403
Are you Akshay?

403
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:29,745
Mehul... How are you? I'm very well.

404
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,478
Yes, she's here before me.

405
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:38,184
I? - Actually, she was talking
about you a while ago. Yes.

406
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,924
She said that you'll call today.
And you have.

407
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,288
Sir, what a tuning you
both have in every matter!

408
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,798
Mehul, I won't tell you much. Nine.

409
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,205
It's reasonable, Mehul.

410
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,044
Eight is very less.

411
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,907
Eight? No, I won't go.

412
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,981
Look, Madhu is saying eight
and half, I'd have refused.

413
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,516
Yes. Done?

414
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,415
Okay. Will you go now?

415
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,321
Now? Let me have my lunch.

416
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,717
I haven't eaten
anything since morning.

417
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:13,788
Because of your Akshay thing...

418
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,483
Madhu is saying,
she'll have lunch with you.

419
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,754
Yes, a mood will be set. Yes.

420
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,660
Really? You mean not even an egg?

421
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,969
Oh... Paneer Bhurji without
onions and garlic.

422
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,538
Tell him to feed his mother.

423
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,007
No, the fast is very important,
Mehul. I'll send Madhu.

424
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,735
Yes, she'll reach within an hour.

425
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:39,316
Yes... Yes.
So, Mehul... at 8.30, right?

426
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,654
Okay. Bye Mehul. Okay.

427
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,783
Take 500 rupees tip.
It will become nine.

428
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,586
Tell me. What will you eat?

429
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,193
Your Akshay is eating my head.

430
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,627
Martin... - Can't you
see tension on my face?

431
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,471
What happened?
- He came home yesterday.

432
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,370
You know that I was
with some other customer.

433
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,702
Does it look good?

434
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,805
One bell, two bells,
three bells, four bells...

435
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,373
Poor customer thought
that police has come.

436
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,376
I was trying to make him
understand when one more bell...

437
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,077
How did he dare
to come to my house?

438
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,578
Yes, sir...

439
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,193
One Sicilian Risotto for madam...
- I don't want any Sicilian dish.

440
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,155
I want minced mutton
and bread with butter and...

441
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,663
...shallots with coriander.

442
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,297
Got it? - Yes, sir.

443
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,906
Listen, I've spoken
to your landlord. And...

444
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,704
Landlord?
You aren't listening to me, Bobby.

445
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,442
Madhu... You said, I heard.

446
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,384
Yes... - I want to see
Mr. Akshay Singh, please.

447
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:26,586
Your name? - Bobby. Hi...

448
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,987
Please wait. I'll inform him.

449
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:33,060
Paging for Aks.
Mr. Bobby wants to see you. Thanks.

450
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,961
How much do you earn
in a month? - What?

451
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,300
No, I mean...
- Excuse me.

452
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,130
Hi babe... - Yes.

453
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:47,039
Okay, listen. I'm in a presentation
with a client here. - Okay.

454
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,839
Tell him I'm not here, okay?
- Yes.

455
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,408
Okay. - Bye.

456
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:55,252
Mr. Akshay has gone out.
Can I take your message?

457
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:57,981
Has he gone out? - Yes.

458
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,021
Sir, you can't do that!

459
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:09,166
Akshay, this isn't right. You
call at night 1.30 am or 2.00 am.

460
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,494
Don't I receive your call?
- Sir, sir... please!

461
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,694
Last week he called up at 3.30 am
in the night.

462
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,531
I had received his call.

463
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,196
Tell me Akshay,
didn't I receive or not?

464
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,972
I send you good and pretty girls,
don't I?

465
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,471
Ukranian, South African...

466
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,104
And I also charge you less.

467
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,783
International calls
but at local rates.

468
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,610
Who gives this offer nowadays?

469
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:33,587
Does anybody give? No... And
you're saying you aren't here?

470
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,258
This fellow... So cheap he is!

471
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,654
I give your office
clients girls for free.

472
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,796
He was even asking for my number.
- Come next time...

473
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,327
...I'll charge you so high,
I'll charge you so high that...

474
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,094
Bobby... What are you doing?

475
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,104
Look... Madhu isn't your wife.

476
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,440
And her house isn't your house
that you'll go whenever you want.

477
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,481
If you go to Madhu's
house without invitation...

478
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:04,016
...I'll go and meet your
wife without invitation. Got it?

479
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,246
Yes, I get it.

480
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,448
And I haven't yet
told your office staff...

481
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,956
...that you had called
for a guy once.

482
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,352
Should I tell them? - No.

483
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,191
Sure? - Please, I beg of you.

484
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,728
Put it off then. Take this. Bye.

485
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,708
My name is Shakti Chinappa.
I sell drugs. Pure stuff.

486
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,605
Why do I sell? I get good money.

487
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,345
Now, don't tell me
that I do bad work and...

488
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,083
...drug is that termite
that makes the society hollow.

489
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,817
If you don't want
to buy then don't.

490
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,987
I don't want your
free advice, got it?

491
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,141
Hi Pooja. Congratulations!

492
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:12,718
You? Today is my wedding.

493
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,621
So... are you tensed?
- Yes... a little.

494
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:18,957
No problem.

495
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,194
Room No? - 125.

496
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,395
Mr. Groom...

497
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,830
Which perfume is it?
- Passion fruit...

498
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:04,202
...with a hint of Vanilla.

499
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,509
Taste it.

500
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,040
We're going to steal
the groom's shoes.

501
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,443
And we'll get lots
of money for that.

502
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,983
Excuse me... Have you seen my wife?

503
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,148
I think she has gone towards
the room. - Oh... Thanks.

504
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,786
So, what was I saying?

505
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,660
Attend the wedding and go.

506
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,969
I've to go somewhere else.

507
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,601
To meet some other bride?

508
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,245
Oh! That's the husband.

509
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:49,145
Hi, congratulations! You've got
a beautiful and a very hot wife.

510
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,651
Have fun, okay?

511
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:51,879
Bye...

512
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,148
Hi baby...

513
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:04,693
Dev sir,
Dilip sir, Raj sir and Pinto sir.

514
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,529
By Pinto sir, I mean my Daddu.

515
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,601
And Daddu was Mumbai's
number one car thief.

516
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,877
He stole Dev sir's Fiat.

517
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,451
Not from his house but
from his film's premier.

518
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,752
The film Jewel Thief had released.

519
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:32,386
By the way, that Fiat
is my beloved. She's my life.

520
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,627
Wherever I see the fiat,
I go straight to his owner.

521
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,534
To ask for my beloved.

522
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,507
I don't know...

523
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,777
Something happens to
me on seeing the Fiat car.

524
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,241
Within me, a sort of...

525
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,612
Where are you lost?

526
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:29,118
I can understand your feelings.
I also sit on the chair here and...

527
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,188
...keep staring at
it for hours together.

528
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,590
She's my darling, she's my life.

529
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,999
Daddu too had the same Fiat car.
- He had?

530
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,193
I mean, it's now with me. - Oh...

531
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,098
Daddu didn't give it
to me when I asked from him.

532
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,736
So, I stole it from him.
- Stole it?

533
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,283
You're a very funny man.

534
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,655
You too... uncle.

535
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,025
Sell your car;
I've given you such a nice offer.

536
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,158
Father...

537
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:23,972
Son... Johnny... this, over here...
this is my heart... Heart.

538
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,440
And that thing outside...
that isn't a car...

539
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,612
...that's my heart beat...
heart beat.

540
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,113
It's my child.
How can I sell it? Tell me.

541
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,154
You'll have to make your
heart a little strong, uncle.

542
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,345
Heart... strong?

543
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,921
Heart... strong.

544
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,489
I must say you're very funny.

545
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,789
You should laugh like this.
It's good for heart, uncle.

546
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,854
What is it? - What are you looking
at me? First, open the gate.

547
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,490
What happened?
- We got a call from here.

548
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,224
Why? - Your boss
has got a heart attack.

549
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,391
Has sir got a heart attack? - Yes!

550
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,295
We had got a phone call.

551
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,340
I'll go and check right away.

552
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,636
What are you looking at?
Get the stretcher!

553
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,574
I haven't got a heart attack.
How many times should I tell you?

554
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,779
Why did you call then? - Who called
you? C'mon, get out from here!

555
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,581
Idiots come to our house
in the middle of the night!

556
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,816
C'mon, let's go! Was I dreaming?

557
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,428
Wait! Ambulance! Stop!

558
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,869
Pinto, why are you
increasing the speed?

559
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:14,169
Pinto, don't increase the
speed... no! Pinto! Take care!

560
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,085
I had told you... I had told you,
not to increase the speed.

561
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,345
You don't listen to me!
Now, go reverse.

562
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,657
Carefully... carefully.

563
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,527
Pinto... Pinto... Pinto... carefully!

564
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,498
Pinto! I had told
you... I had told you!

565
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,193
Now, you got banged from the back.

566
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:41,963
Now, move forward.

567
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:47,902
Now, what?

568
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,307
No, Pinto... no! Pinto... no. No!

569
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:55,952
Pinto... no!
Pinto... no! No, Pinto! No, no, no.

570
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,416
No, no... No...

571
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,626
What? Should I get down now?

572
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,728
Alright... I'll shut the door.
Stop!

573
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,298
I'm trying to shut the door. Pinto!

574
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,563
Stop!

575
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,205
The door is here!

576
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,939
I've stolen many cars for money.

577
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:01,541
From Mercedes,
Benz, BMW's to Maruti 800.

578
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,154
But Fiat car...

579
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,627
In this city, there will
be only one Fiat car... Mine.

580
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,459
Albert Pinto, Car thief. Yo!

581
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,382
I'm listening to you.
You had told me last time too.

582
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,263
I had suffered a
loss of 5 millions.

583
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,294
This time, tell me definitely.

584
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,130
Will it lose the game? Sure?

585
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:52,958
Alright. I'll take 50.

586
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,105
But the result should be today.

587
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:01,242
Good morning, sister-in-law.
- Good morning, sir. How you are?

588
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:06,512
Don't say, How you are?
Sister-in-law. Say, How are you?

589
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,352
What have you brought?
Sister-in-law had asked for mutton.

590
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,646
Where did you bring it from? - From
the place where I bring it daily.

591
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:15,925
It wasn't fresh last time. - Mutton
was fresh but your mood was bad.

592
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,620
You're my wife and taking his side!

593
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,125
Are you teaching only English?
- What sir? You too...

594
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,427
Come here...

595
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,164
...these are twenty million rupees.

596
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,841
Chandu and you will
go to Kalyan tonight.

597
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,674
Chandu knows the address.

598
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,643
You've to go far;
therefore, tonight you won't drink.

599
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,251
Got it? - Yes, absolutely.

600
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,853
Listen, Chandu. - If sir
drinks today, I'll shoot you.

601
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,015
Yes, sir.

602
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,768
Chandu, what are these
twenty millions for?

603
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,999
It's for strong reason, sir.

604
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,771
A new party has come in
Kalyan that makes fake currency.

605
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,172
You've to give twenty million
real currency notes and...

606
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,079
...take away 30 million
fake currency notes.

607
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,581
But real is real.

608
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,211
These fake notes are more
real than the real notes, sir.

609
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,811
I've seen them.

610
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:22,718
What does he do?

611
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,986
Mr. Choksi said that once he took a
gun in his pad and was on his way.

612
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,598
Then? - When a speed breaker came,
the gun got shot in the pad.

613
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,300
What happened then?
- Then what? He got shot.

614
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,638
What was his name? - Gotiya.

615
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:48,267
Chandu... Chandu, get up.

616
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:50,146
Get down.

617
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,007
Money is very evil, sir.

618
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:58,245
Look Chandu, you're my friend.
I don't want to kill you.

619
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,119
Get down.
- Is there a bullet in the pistol?

620
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,257
Why would you roam around
with an empty pistol?

621
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,661
Now, do you understand, why?

622
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,805
Look, there's still time.
Why are you wasting your life?

623
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,610
Shoot me.

624
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,215
Ta, ta...

625
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:39,157
What are you doing, sir?
Are you sleeping? - No...

626
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,002
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

627
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,514
Don't go here and there.
They are very dangerous.

628
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,787
We'll go and come back. Got it?

629
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,687
Should I come along? - Yes, come.

630
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,144
Chandu, shut the door.

631
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:37,276
How is Mr.
Choksi? - He's absolutely fine.

632
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,834
Are they in full?
- A total of 20 millions.

633
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:01,900
Darwa, keep his 20millions
and give his 30 millions.

634
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,384
No... these are only 15 millions.

635
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,611
Should I give 2
of 15 millions? - No.

636
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,117
Give this one.
This contains 30 millions. - Okay.

637
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,996
Take Chandu, your 30 millions.
Count them.

638
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,736
There's no need to count, Sajjan.
- Count them.

639
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,548
Hey! Why are you roaming here?

640
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,302
What sir?

641
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,567
Did you call me here in the
afternoon just to drink liqueur?

642
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,411
You had told, you want to talk
something important. Tell us... sir.

643
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,078
Yes...

644
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,382
Bobby... - Yes.

645
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:58,756
Until when will you work as a Pimp?
- Why? What happened, sir?

646
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,527
Do you want promotion
in your life or not?

647
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:04,932
Do you have any dream or not?

648
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:09,828
For instance,
I dream to own a Mercedes car.

649
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,434
I'll sit behind and
someone would drive me.

650
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,476
I don't like Mercedes, sir.

651
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:19,342
I'll make a queue of Fiat car.
Cute and sexy.

652
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:23,914
Sir, I want to open my
own Escort Service Agency.

653
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,712
Beautiful girls!
Only corporate girls.

654
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,516
You had come here to be a singer.
Did you forget?

655
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,789
Escort agency! Do you want
to open your own studio or not?

656
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,994
That will need too much money, sir.

657
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,295
Therefore,
I've called you all here.

658
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:45,164
Sir, talk straight. If
you talk in riddles I get tensed.

659
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,037
Last time too,
you had... - 200 millions.

660
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,876
50 million each.

661
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,615
What do you think?

662
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,565
Bobby, you'll have
your recording studio.

663
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,130
Pinto, you'll have a car showroom.

664
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,572
And Shakti,
you'll have your night club.

665
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,871
And I'll have my Tution Institute,
a house in the city and...

666
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:29,742
...a farm house outside the city.
Two imported cars in the garage.

667
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:33,511
Five star luxury.
Holidays in the foreign countries.

668
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,891
Whom do we have to rob, sir?

669
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,824
In the Kalyan village...

670
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,089
...there's a den where the business
of fake currency takes place.

671
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:48,964
Fake notes, more real than
the real notes. I've seen them.

672
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:56,301
And there are only two men there.
Only two. There's no one else.

673
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,572
No one at all.

674
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,412
Now, these two men will
be there for four more days.

675
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:09,389
There job is to take the real notes
and give fake notes in return.

676
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:15,195
One the fourth day,
only real notes will be left there.

677
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,829
Because the fake currency
must've all sold off.

678
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,269
At least 200 million
is lying over there.

679
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:27,469
200... millions.

680
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,813
Think about it.
They are two and we are four.

681
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,757
I didn't understand one thing,
sir. - What?

682
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:47,858
There's 200 millions inside...

683
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,193
...and there are only
2 men to look after it.

684
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,234
The what? - You're drunk, sir.
There must be more security.

685
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,337
There's no security.
It's not there.

686
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,708
There are only two them. I've seen.

687
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:03,539
Give me a glass. - But sir...
They must be having that...

688
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,776
Pistol? - Revolver.

689
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,007
Even we can arrange
for the revolvers.

690
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,983
Sir, sir...
The matter is very risky.

691
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,448
There can also be loss of life.

692
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:20,290
You steal the cars. He sells
the drugs. He supplies the girls.

693
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,131
Isn't there any risk
in the jobs you do?

694
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,224
Correct.

695
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:31,197
Still, you all are alive.

696
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:39,542
There's always a risk
in our business, isn't it?

697
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:45,052
Let's see the place.
What do you say? - Very good!

698
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,251
Let's drink to that.

699
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,724
No liqueur from tomorrow.

700
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,058
I was wondering why
he didn't say that till now.

701
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,922
He always speaks
of quitting the liqueur.

702
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:04,198
Sir, it's been half an hour.
Where's this Pinto?

703
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,239
It takes time to examine the place.
He must be coming.

704
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,972
By the way,
the place is absolutely isolated.

705
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,840
I mean there's no tension
that someone will see.

706
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,914
We'll have to just
deal with 2 men inside.

707
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,715
And I'm assuming that sir is right
and there are only 2 men inside.

708
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:18,854
Yes, there are only 2 men.

709
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,455
There are only two. Definitely.
- That's it.

710
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,785
Sir... I've examined the place.

711
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,324
Don't sit on the car.
It isn't a sofa set.

712
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,125
There's a door behind the bungalow.

713
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:34,292
And over there
is an imperfect road.

714
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:37,036
Absolutely isolated.
There's no shop or house.

715
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,308
And at the back, there's
a door that has an imperfect lock.

716
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,444
And now risks.
The only risk is... Bobby!

717
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,347
The risk is that
there are 2 men inside.

718
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,450
Now, I don't know whether
sir is saying this or his liqueur.

719
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:53,419
I'm telling you there
are only 2 men. I've seen them.

720
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,391
Rahul, shut the door, quickly!

721
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:16,070
These men are timid!

722
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,247
And there are only two.
Double timid.

723
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,624
Come here, I'll shoot you today.

724
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,100
I've decided. - What?

725
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:50,175
We'll disguise as police and go.

726
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,509
Splendid idea, sir.

727
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,821
I'll be the commissioner.

728
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,524
Let's go out to welcome them.

729
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,256
Idiot, do you think of
anything other than killing?

730
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,667
On hearing the name of
police my blood starts boiling.

731
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:15,066
If they come before me... - Uncle,
don't shout.

732
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,103
If they come we'll
shred them with bullets.

733
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,003
And if they don't
it's their good fortune.

734
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,741
You don't try to show
your bravery uninvited.

735
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,741
Pinto... - Yes.

736
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,479
I want a police van.

737
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,345
Police van? Why?

738
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,388
Didn't you see what had happened
to them on hearing the siren?

739
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,463
There are two advantages
of a police van.

740
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,196
First is, they will get scared.

741
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,169
And the second thing
is all the money...

742
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,537
...will fit properly
in the police van.

743
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,912
Who will stop the police van?

744
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,479
We can nicely take all
the money and flee the city.

745
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,312
Where will we bring
the police van from?

746
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,956
We'll steal any van and color it.
Right, Pinto?

747
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:19,166
What is your favorite color,
Bobby? - Red.

748
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:29,872
So... how have you been Mr. Mhatre?

749
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:32,205
Son of a British...

750
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:41,455
Have you purchased it?
- Our time isn't so bad, Mhatre.

751
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,217
What do you have to do with it?

752
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,622
We've to get it painted
in blue and yellow.

753
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,528
A red and a yellow
band on the blue body.

754
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,197
And a grill in the front.

755
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,367
And a light that
revolves at the top.

756
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,797
And sir, we want a siren too.
- Yes, a siren too.

757
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,866
And we want the delivery till
the evening day after tomorrow.

758
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,911
It's a very complicated job.
- Money too is very complicated.

759
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:08,711
It will be done.

760
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,644
It's a good idea sir.

761
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,516
Even if there's 200 million inside,
each one will get 50.

762
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:18,417
And if we get caught,
each one will get 100.

763
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,664
Take your shares and flee the city.
- Correct.

764
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,225
If we don't remain in touch, there
are less chances of getting caught.

765
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,425
Correct.

766
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,796
I think the time to cry
and hug each other has come.

767
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:33,705
Actually, I was thinking the same.
Then I thought, forget it.

768
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:35,808
Let's do a video shooting.

769
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,440
Whenever you feel
like crying and hugging...

770
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:42,244
...you should see
the video and laugh.

771
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:51,284
My name is Pankaj Suri.
Everybody calls me 'Sir'.

772
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:58,061
I'm... I was a professor
of English at National College.

773
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,060
In fact, I was the bloody
Head of the Department.

774
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,295
Speak in Hindi.

775
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,868
Come inside.

776
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,708
Sir, I was creating such a good
feeling of jail through the window.

777
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,243
You act strange sometimes, sir.

778
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:17,249
Her anatomy was absolutely amazing.

779
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,217
There was nothing emotional
between us. Nothing emotional.

780
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,359
It wasjust physical.

781
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,122
Bobby. Hi...

782
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,357
I had come here to be a singer.

783
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,465
I became friends with girls and I...

784
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:35,993
...became the manager.

785
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,433
Say, pimp... pimp.

786
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:41,537
In the olden days,
the manager was called as the pimp.

787
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,470
Pinto... one more... last, okay?

788
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,444
I forgot the goggles.
Listen! I look good.

789
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:47,674
Listen! Pinto!

790
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:52,019
My name is Shakti Chinappa.
I sell drugs. Pure stuff.

791
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,150
Why do I sell? I get good money.

792
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,250
There's only one
Fiat car in this city...

793
00:59:58,194 --> 00:59:59,183
Mine.

794
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:03,197
Albert Pinto... Car thief. Yo!

795
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,234
Wonderful! Wonderful!

796
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,668
Bobby... Why is this fountain
called as a fountain?

797
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,709
Why isn't it called Anarkali?
- What?

798
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:22,975
Because a sparkler is called a
sparkler and not Phoolmati. Got it?

799
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,017
Now, my turn.

800
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,713
If it bursts in the sky
then it's called explosion and...

801
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:32,520
...if it bursts in the heart then
it is called just a burst. Why sir?

802
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:33,821
Why sir?

803
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,190
Ask him.
He has a fire cracker shop.

804
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:44,540
So, Bobby... let's
have some... fireworks.

805
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,935
Okay. Yes!

806
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,575
Nothing, you want to start.
- Nothing...

807
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,469
You're juicy

808
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:17,299
You're spicy

809
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,539
You're juicy

810
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,913
You're spicy

811
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:33,055
You're juicy

812
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:36,384
You're spicy

813
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,355
You can't lay your hands on me

814
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,789
My youth isn't inexpensive

815
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,931
I'm the queen of
the one who has money

816
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:44,531
You can't lay your hands on me

817
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,328
My youth isn't inexpensive

818
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,232
I'm the queen of
the one who has money

819
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,374
Setting... My setting is done

820
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,567
Setting... My setting is done

821
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:59,339
Setting,
setting... My setting is done

822
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,916
You swayed your waist
and took my life away.

823
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,787
Now, you're showing attitude,
look everyone.

824
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,259
Don't trouble me

825
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:18,028
Will you come along with me?
Tell me

826
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,667
You can't lay your hands on me

827
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,167
My youth isn't inexpensive

828
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,273
I'm the queen of
the one who has money

829
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:27,131
You can't lay your hands on me

830
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,641
My youth isn't inexpensive

831
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:31,470
I'm the queen of
the one who has money

832
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,741
Setting... My setting is done

833
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,886

Setting,

835
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:49,322
Setting is done!

836
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,591
Setting is done!

837
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,825
Setting is done!

838
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:01,076
Don't tell me, don't tell me

839
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,977
Don't tell me...

840
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,677
Today, I'm poor but
tomorrow I'll be rich

841
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,410
My life will be good, darling

842
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,248
Please say, yes today.

843
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,220
I'll give you money

844
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:17,689
You can't lay your hands on me

845
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,350
My youth isn't inexpensive

846
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:22,089

Setting,

Setting,
setting... My setting is done

853
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,713
Where have you brought us, sir?
Is the address correct? - Yes.

854
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:49,024
You won't get pistols
in a five star hotel, will you?

855
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,323
Why won't we get?

856
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:56,921
Amma...

857
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,293
How many do you want?

858
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,496
Four.

859
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,909
Sir...

860
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:28,752
Amma... isn't there a small one?

861
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:31,900
Nowadays, everyone uses this.

862
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,599
We stay in Mumbai, not in Chambal.

863
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:37,629
We want a small one. Right, sir?

864
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,176
34...

865
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:52,786
34!

866
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,779
You've become fat.
You'll have quit liqueur.

867
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,288
Will the tape fall short? - No, no.

868
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:57,925
Let me hold. - 46.

869
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,061
Are you insane?
This is ladies Shirt.

870
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:01,688
Can I tell you something, sir?

871
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:04,925
Will you mind?

872
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,896
Will you mind?
- Okay, we won't mind. Say...

873
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,874
Do you know how will you
look in such funny clothes?

874
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,609
How will we look?
- Exactly like a police.

875
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:04,348
Fit the steering. - Yes, sir.

876
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,694
Buntya, take this. - Mhatre sir...

877
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,273
Where is our forty eighty four?

878
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,114
I was going to call you.

879
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,578
Tell us now what you were
going to say on the phone.

880
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,647
How can I say?
- Speak from your mouth.

881
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,812
Yes.

882
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:38,048
Your van is stolen.

883
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:54,733
Forget it.

884
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,069
We had stolen someone's
van and someone's stole ours.

885
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,407
So what? - Never mind.
We'll steal another van.

886
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,845
We've to steal the van...

887
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,280
...get it painted,
and fix the siren and the light.

888
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,216
Where do we have so much time?
20 millions are lying there.

889
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:08,788
20 millions... They can be ours.

890
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,222
The question is how adamant are we?

891
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,762
What happens even if we're adamant?
Will we get the van because of it?

892
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,158
It can come too.

893
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:40,652
Bobby will stand at the gate.
And we will go inside.

894
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,460
Shakti will sign the register...

895
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:50,857
...and Pinto and I
will go towards the van.

896
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:36,702
I don't find the idea good.

897
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:37,895
No? - No.

898
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:42,305
Our brain doesn't work
with tea and such stuff. - Okay!

899
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,545
Chhote, bring 4 glasses.

900
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,773
Come, come, come, my dear Rum.

901
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,653
Because of Rum,
the mind will kick start.

902
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:11,199
What? - No, I mean did
it kick start or should I do it?

903
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,710
Should I say something?
- Who can stop you now?

904
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:22,274
Sir, we've thought enough.

905
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,411
Now, let's directly go.

906
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,679
Absolutely correct. I agree.

907
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:29,915
What do you mean? We'll go home?

908
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:34,586
No, no, no... Let's go inside.
And steal the van.

909
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:39,734
But plan sir... What is the plan?
- The plan is there's no plan.

910
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:41,894
No, it's nothing as such.

911
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,198
You should go inside
and give a fight.

912
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,098
We'll manage whatever happens.

913
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:48,532
One more.

914
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:51,373
Bobby, your liqueur
is speaking too much.

915
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:57,385
But didn't it say the right thing?
Didn't it say the right thing?

916
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:02,685
Very good!

917
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,316
He got the hair on his chest!

918
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,190
Let's attack. - C'mon.

919
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,497
Shall we go?

920
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,498
Let's go.

921
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,132
Salute, sir. - Are you alone?

922
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:52,237
No, Tawde has gone to the washroom.

923
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,342
Were you sleeping? - No.

924
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:55,938
Did you have a drink? - No.

925
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:57,840
Why are your eyes so red? - No...

926
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:04,248
Tawde... Tawde, come quickly.
Sir has come.

927
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:06,944
He must be Tawde.
- Hello. Sawant, I'm coming.

928
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,090
We'll have to tell
him which van is ours.

929
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,451
How can we say just like that, sir?

930
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,219
What do we know which
van is ready and which isn't?

931
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,862
He'll ask us ten questions, sir.
- We'll get trapped.

932
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:21,230
There's no need to take any
tension because of my fate. - What?

933
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,342
Is 2512 ready?
It's ready since afternoon, sir.

934
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,104
Give me the keys.
- Sawant didn't tell me anything.

935
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:33,713
Give the keys.
We've to go and raid.

936
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,907
Sawant, bring quickly
the keys for 2512.

937
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,710
Which one? - 2512.

938
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,046
Okay, okay, I'm bringing it.

939
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:42,319
Did you show the receipt? - Does
Sawant drink liqueur on duty?

940
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,084
No, no, sir. - Tawde, earlier
you were in Dindoshi, weren't you?

941
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,995
No, Millat Nagar... Millat Nagar.
- Beer or whisky.

942
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,261
Beer, sir.
No, don't have beer.

943
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,525
Because of beer you've to go to pee
several times. - That's right, sir.

944
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:55,167
It keeps happening
during monsoons, sir.

945
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:01,099
Let's go. We're leaving. - Bye sir.

946
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,944
One night... One night

947
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,846
One hell of a ride

948
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:12,786
Come, little bit is left.
Let's have it.

949
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,149
Let's go. - Let's go.

950
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:16,153
One night... One night

951
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:19,385
One hell of a ride

952
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,862
4084

953
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,765
Didn't the dear Rum
say the right thing?

954
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,169
Shakti, Shakti, stop at the right.

955
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,673
Okay, here? - Over here.

956
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:40,705
Sir, I've duty on number 12.

957
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:45,979
Who all wants to have liqueur?
- Surprising, sir!

958
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,815
You said that we'll halt
the van behind the house...

959
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:48,649
...and start at three.

960
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,857
Little bit.
- Sir, there's liqueur at home.

961
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,688
I want to drink right now.
- Me too.

962
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,389
Give it to those in the van...

963
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,531
...and tell sirs that
tomorrow is a dry day. - Okay.

964
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,897
Pinto, give me 100 bucks.
- Why me? Am I...

965
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,764
Give me 50. - But you...

966
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,596
Give me!
Give me. - You're surprising.

967
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,436
Give me, give me.
This much is fine. - You...

968
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:09,804
It's okay.

969
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,439
Tomorrow is dry day, sir.

970
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,104
Is it okay if we keep
open tonight till late?

971
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,807
No, no... it won't do.

972
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,609
Bring Rum. - Yes, sir.

973
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:19,981
Listen, listen. - Yes.

974
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:22,323
Keep this here.
Go and get Rum! - Yes.

975
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:27,988
Sir, listen to me. Let's go home.
- Shakti, you're a policeman now.

976
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:30,461
Don't think like a thief.

977
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:54,779
Take this. Cut it.

978
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,959
Blockade! - Ahead.

979
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,033
The liqueur...

980
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:47,401
Sir, look behind. - Who is it?

981
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,736
Don't stop.

982
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,804
It's the policeman. Real one.

983
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:06,292
Shakti, we'll have to meet him.
- Gone are the 200 millions.

984
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,159
Real policeman. Sir,
I told you let's leave from here.

985
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:11,093
Let's leave this place.
Now, we're trapped.

986
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:13,627
How will we get out of this? -
I'm telling you, let's go and meet.

987
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,469
We can't run away.

988
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,971
Why are you scared? We're police.

989
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,934
Is my moustache alright? - Yes.

990
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:23,802
Let's go.

991
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:31,045
Mahesh Naik, Crime Branch.

992
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,844
Pankaj Suri, Beat number 3, Wadala.

993
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:38,720
Did you drink? - Off duty.

994
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,794
And you? - I drive.

995
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,931
And you? - Almost negligible.

996
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:49,225
And...

997
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:51,265
And what, sir?
- Do you have some more?

998
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:54,942
What sir? - That you've drunk.

999
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,045
I have it, sir. - Give me then.

1000
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,982
Take it, sir. - Is the gun loaded?

1001
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,152
Yes, it is.

1002
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,991
Tony Bisleri... He has
hidden in hotel Dwarka.

1003
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,524
My back up is late.
You all come along with me. - What?

1004
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,426
Hey! - Yes...

1005
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:22,763
Let's go. - Yes, yes.

1006
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,394
Let's go.

1007
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:29,266
Where to? - Take the highway.

1008
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:31,870
What will happen?

1009
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,674
We haven't given a thought

1010
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:37,076
We've no one to look after us

1011
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:40,180
Our life's like this

1012
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,250
Superb!

1013
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,351
Squeezed the lemon into the Rum

1014
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:49,429
Added soda to it

1015
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,533
Fired a gun without the bullets

1016
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:55,032
What an idea!

1017
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,634
Our van has now started running

1018
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,833
Just like a Ferrari!

1019
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,076
Highway is in front

1020
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,908
And adjacent to me is Baby!

1021
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,953
Break all the signals

1022
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:15,413
Press the accelerator

1023
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:18,115
Speed up the van

1024
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,256
Have you ever done an encounter?

1025
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,897
Shoot!

1026
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:24,497
Make your life

1027
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,258
And speed up!

1028
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:33,364
One night... One night

1029
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,978
One hell of a ride!

1030
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,807
4084

1031
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:41,141
One night!

1032
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:42,316
Now what?

1033
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:44,874
Let's go.

1034
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,422
Tony Bisleri.

1035
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:02,236
Let's go.

1036
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,562
Come...

1037
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,725
Lock the main door from inside.
Is there any other entry?

1038
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,051
There's staff entry, sir.
From the kitchen. - Lock it.

1039
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:30,058
No one will enter and no one
will exit. Stop the room service.

1040
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,563
And stop the phone service
of all the rooms, got it?

1041
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,064
Yes, why sir? Anything serious?

1042
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:35,698
Have you seen him? - No, sir.

1043
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,470
Tony Bisleri. He's in this hotel.

1044
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:40,164
I don't know, sir.
I'm on night duty. I just came.

1045
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:43,873
How many rooms are there?
- 25... 25.

1046
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:46,672
You both begin from upstairs.
And you all come with me.

1047
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:51,816
Don't spare a single room. I
want Tony. Dead or alive. Let's go.

1048
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,416
Not from there. From here. - Sir.

1049
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:02,720
Hey! - Yes?

1050
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,320
Come.

1051
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,943
What's going on inside? - What
happened? What's the matter, sir?

1052
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,485
What's going on? - Nothing.

1053
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,848
Nothing's going on, sir.

1054
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:33,952
A gangster is hiding in this hotel.

1055
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,622
Shut the door and sit inside.

1056
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:36,923
Otherwise, there are
chances of getting killed.

1057
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:38,156
Okay, sir. Okay. - Got it?

1058
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:44,731
Sir... listen to me. Sir, listen!

1059
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,407
Not much time is left for four
to strike. Let's escape from here.

1060
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:50,669
I won't go without those two.
You go if you want.

1061
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:52,176
What is this, sir?

1062
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:55,111
This matter... Why are you
getting involved in this matter?

1063
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,077
Have you come here to
knock or to or to make noise?

1064
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:00,521
Knock the door.

1065
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,490
What is this? - We come
here to play card sometimes.

1066
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,595
They're playing Flash.

1067
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:18,630
You all are playing cards...
Continue with your game.

1068
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:22,532
It's a warning. No one
will come out unless we tell you.

1069
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,544
Is there some problem, sir?
- Yes, we're searching for someone.

1070
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:30,082
Bullets might be fired.
- Yes, bullets might be fired.

1071
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,348
Keep the doors shut.

1072
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:38,919
What is this?

1073
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,857
Let's escape. Where are we trapped?

1074
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:42,660
Let me think. Let me think.

1075
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:44,354
There must be some way out.

1076
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,833
Now you go inside.
I don't know what the problem is.

1077
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,603
I don't know what the problem is.
You go. - Come with me.

1078
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:03,579
Hello... Hello, listen... Listen
everybody... Hello! Listen!

1079
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:11,021
Will you please...
Listen... Listen! Please...

1080
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,392
Hey! Everybody shut up!

1081
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,025
Listen to what he is saying.

1082
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,524
The next bottle will break
on someone's head. Got it?

1083
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:18,688
Now, listen to me.

1084
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,931
A gangster is hiding in the hotel.
Police is searching for him.

1085
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:24,229
There's danger.
Bullets might be fired.

1086
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,430
Be alert.

1087
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:28,303
And don't move from here until you
get all clear from the police.

1088
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:32,776
Okay? - Hail Mumbai Police!

1089
01:22:33,214 --> 01:22:36,274
Mumbai Police! - Long live!

1090
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:39,551
Yes... yes.

1091
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:41,249
Let's go.

1092
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,351
Will you wear all
the ornaments today only?

1093
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,332
Police... Police!

1094
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,461
But what have I done, sir?

1095
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,405
Who is she? Is she your wife?

1096
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,968
Or is she your neighbor?
Who is she? - Sir...

1097
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,668
Don't say, sir, sir.
Open the bag, open the bag.

1098
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,076
Open the bag, open the bag! Do
one thing. Check the upper floor.

1099
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,638
I'll look after the matter here.

1100
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,410
We've to check the upper floor.
- Let's go.

1101
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,110
Yes...

1102
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:15,645
Sir...

1103
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:24,365
Go that side. Go!

1104
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:25,499
Yes.

1105
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,490
Open the bag.

1106
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:40,378
From where did you get
so many valuables?

1107
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:41,674
All this is yours, sir.

1108
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,315
You... you take it, sir.
- From where?

1109
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:46,779
Sir... sir... Om Jewellers.

1110
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:49,583
Sir... - You're the one who killed
both your partners, didn't you?

1111
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:51,214
She's the wife of one of them,
isn't she?

1112
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:00,593
Where are we stuck?

1113
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:03,602
Let's do this drama until
we get a chance to escape.

1114
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:04,794
Look over here.

1115
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,037
No one's here.

1116
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:10,700
Sir, soon it will be 4o'clock. 200
millions will slip from our hands.

1117
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,242
No... Whatever we do,
four of us will do together.

1118
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,079
Look here. Knock the door.

1119
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:28,192
What are you laughing?

1120
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:33,597
Gangster Tony Bisleri
is hiding in this hotel.

1121
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:36,997
Don't come out.

1122
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:43,571
'Tony Bisleri.
He's hiding in hotel Dwarka'

1123
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,771
'Tony Bisleri. He's in this hotel.'

1124
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:57,287
Brother Tony.
We aren't policemen. We're just...

1125
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,984
He's saying absolute truth.
We aren't policemen.

1126
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,259
Is something written on my face?

1127
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:09,529
How many more are there?

1128
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:14,938
We four and Mahesh Naik.

1129
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,010
Brother, should I shoot him?
- Hey...

1130
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:18,434
Where are the others?

1131
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:21,072
I don't know.

1132
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:25,177
Idiots, I know that
Bhau has sent you all.

1133
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,853
No, no... - I left his gang and
co-operated with the police so...

1134
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,184
...Bhau sent police after me!
- You...

1135
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,623
How much money did you
ask from Bhau to do my encounter?

1136
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,093
What are you saying?

1137
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,355
Brother Tony!

1138
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:44,936
Kalsekar. - Sir...

1139
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:47,640
Police van is standing
outside. 2512.

1140
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:51,543
Yes, they've sneaked it from
Wadala. There are four people.

1141
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,613
They were roaming
around as Specialists.

1142
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,381
I brought them along.
- Why didn't you arrest them?

1143
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,783
Now, should I arrest
them or kill Tony?

1144
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:02,751
I thought to use all four
of them as Bullet Proof Jacket.

1145
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:08,755
First, let's get hold of Tony. Then
we'll find out what they are on to.

1146
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,362
Come here.
- Yes, sir. - You're surprising!

1147
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:14,124
My suitcase is lying in 103.
Keep it in the van. - Okay, sir.

1148
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,302
Go.

1149
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,102
Kalsekar... - Yes, sir.

1150
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:22,136
If we find Tony alive...
we'll get bonus too.

1151
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:29,672
No one's in here. Come.

1152
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:33,848
Hey... Is anyone there
in the bathroom?

1153
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:38,447
There's no one.

1154
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:50,429
Pinto, I hope Sir and Shakti
are alright. - Yes, I hope so.

1155
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:56,175
We'll have to make
a plan to escape.

1156
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:58,539
We'll have to make a plan.

1157
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:00,675
Because of Tony Bisleri...

1158
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:02,873
...forget 200 millions;
I hope we don't get killed.

1159
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:04,449
No, that won't happen.

1160
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:09,214
We're trapped, sir.

1161
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:11,959
Now what!

1162
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:13,950
Oh, no!

1163
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:22,432
Tony...

1164
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:23,604
What's the plan?

1165
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:29,599
There's no plan?

1166
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:31,540
Correct.
- We'll see whatever happens?

1167
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,270
Correct. - You've lost your mind.

1168
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,014
Correct. - What are
you saying correct, correct?

1169
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:36,775
Go down!

1170
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,142
We'll have to...

1171
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:49,755
Cover your head!

1172
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:54,694
Sir!

1173
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:57,000
Run Sir! - Sir!

1174
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:06,041
Run upstairs, sir!

1175
01:28:06,247 --> 01:28:07,271
Go up!

1176
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,246
Run! Run upstairs, quickly!
Run! Run upstairs!

1177
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:17,391
Run, sir!

1178
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:22,989
Let's go!

1179
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:25,894
Kalsekar! Get him!

1180
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:31,272
This door isn't opening!
- This one's open! Come here!

1181
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:34,141
Come, come!
Let's escape from this window!

1182
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:35,969
No, no, no!

1183
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,104
Drop the gun. Drop the gun!

1184
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:39,610
I dropped it, I dropped it...

1185
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:43,308
Hey, Tony! You're dead.

1186
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:46,920
Kalsekar... Kalsekar, let me go!
Let me go!

1187
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:50,023
Meet Bhau and go.
- Damn your Bhau...

1188
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:56,162
Come now... come to Bhau now.

1189
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:07,834
Let's go... let's go!

1190
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,543
Move aside, everyone! Move!

1191
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,843
You're my heart... Sit properly.

1192
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,756
Don't make any noise. Keep quiet.

1193
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:31,227
What is this? Sometimes police
and sometimes you all disturb us.

1194
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:33,560
Where have you brought me?
- What do you mean by that?

1195
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,619
Pinto! Be careful!

1196
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,424
Come, my ATM...

1197
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,234
Pinto, run!

1198
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,889
Hail you!

1199
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:38,959
Mumbai police...

1200
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:45,734
Gun... Idiot, pick up the gun!
- Don't pick it up.

1201
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:52,539
Pick it up and shoot him.
Shoot him! - Don't pick it up!

1202
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,878
What are you looking at them?
Shoot... - You shoot.

1203
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:01,420
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
- I've never fired a gun.

1204
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:04,014
Where am I an encounter specialist?

1205
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:06,257
I'm not even a policeman.
Hold this.

1206
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,928
But you're very lucky. You shoot.

1207
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,063
This isn't a deck of cards.
This is a gun. What are you saying?

1208
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:12,260
Shoot... shoot!

1209
01:31:12,433 --> 01:31:15,197
Pinto, you've very smart.
Shoot... shoot.

1210
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,398
Shoot now.

1211
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:18,834
Go, go, go, go, go...

1212
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,736
You're moving too much, sir.
- Shoot, idiot... Shoot!

1213
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,238
It hasjammed.
I'm not able to fire it.

1214
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:36,853
Sorry.

1215
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:49,360
Idiot, you killed the policeman!

1216
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:52,732
I didn't kill him deliberately.

1217
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:56,304
Now... what now?

1218
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:00,276
We'll say that he killed him.

1219
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,609
How can we say that?
You fired the gun.

1220
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,852
So, I'll give this to him.

1221
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:08,982
He'll kill us then.

1222
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:11,620
Then we'll kill him too.
- How can we shoot him?

1223
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:12,850
We aren't policemen.

1224
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,161
Yes, that's right.

1225
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:17,525
What shall we do now?

1226
01:32:45,326 --> 01:32:51,663
And this Kalsekar and that Mahesh
Naik... both are the dogs of Bhau.

1227
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:59,937
Bisleri, you mean Bhau gave
Mahesh Naik the money to kill you?

1228
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,539
Yes.

1229
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:05,071
So...

1230
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,074
...what now?

1231
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:17,320
Pinto... - Yes.

1232
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:20,961
I can't do this. - Don't see down.

1233
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:28,868
How can I see up and climb down?
- Nothing will happen. Climb down!

1234
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:31,127
This pipe is shaking too much, sir.

1235
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:33,640
The pipe isn't shaking,
you're trembling.

1236
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:45,945
Look, I won't be able to do this.
You all go away.

1237
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,587
How can I climb down over you?

1238
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,755
Pinto... - Yes.

1239
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:55,221
I'm feeling dizzy.

1240
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:57,921
Bobby, look, don't fall on me.

1241
01:33:58,099 --> 01:33:59,794
Go otherwise,
I'll kick you and make you fall.

1242
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:06,172
Who killed Kalsekar?

1243
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,434
Who killed him?

1244
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:15,480
Kalsekar and Tony Bisleri
were fighting. I took the aim, sir.

1245
01:34:16,283 --> 01:34:19,775
But they both were turning too much
so... the pistol had gotjammed.

1246
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,147
I've killed him.

1247
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:27,650
Bhau had said he'd kill you.

1248
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:32,525
Otherwise, I'd have killed
you here, today. Got it?

1249
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:39,067
Can you become police
by stealing police van?

1250
01:34:43,711 --> 01:34:45,110
What were you all planning to do?

1251
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:57,247
Your idea was good.

1252
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,928
You'd have had 100 to 200
millions with you right now.

1253
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:03,825
If you hadn't done time pass.

1254
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:07,195
Look, you take that
money and spare us.

1255
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,460
What will you get by killing us?

1256
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:12,430
100 to 200 millions
are lying there.

1257
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:14,437
And there are only
two men over there.

1258
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:17,905
You aren't going to
get such a tip in your life.

1259
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:23,244
Look, right now,
I'm in a mood to shoot you all.

1260
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:32,450
But after getting 200 millions,
my mood might change. Right?

1261
01:35:37,298 --> 01:35:38,322
Patil... - Yes, sir.

1262
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:40,727
You all go.
I'll be back soon. - Okay, sir.

1263
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,464
Sameer... - Yes, sir.

1264
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:45,070
Drive towards Kalyan.

1265
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:26,140
C'mon, get down.
It's time to become rich.

1266
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:29,942
You, you and you.

1267
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:34,019
Three of you go and get the money.
We'll stay here.

1268
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:37,489
If you act smart, he'll be killed.

1269
01:36:38,425 --> 01:36:40,359
Give me the gun.

1270
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:14,356
Is it proper?
- Sir, knock the door.

1271
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:48,023
What is it? - Mumbai police.

1272
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:51,096
Haryana police. - Haryana police?

1273
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:55,067
Every year, it's the same story.
Wear police uniform and escape.

1274
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:58,433
I won't wear police uniform.
I've a chest of steel.

1275
01:37:58,606 --> 01:38:01,336
What bullet will pierce through it?

1276
01:38:02,076 --> 01:38:05,307
My steel man... Every
time you do this drama.

1277
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:09,138
Uncle, we do this every year?
Have we ever been caught?

1278
01:38:10,017 --> 01:38:12,918
How come you're here? - There are
two brothers. Dharma and Sajjan.

1279
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:16,318
They are from Haryana and
do the business of fake notes.

1280
01:38:16,757 --> 01:38:21,888
They made us chase them for
so many years. Now, it's our turn.

1281
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:24,387
I've caught them
and put them in the van.

1282
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:26,658
We're taking them
away now... to Haryana.

1283
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:33,497
Okay. Mumbai police; do
meet us when you come to Haryana.

1284
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:36,841
Kukad district,
Phoolwari Nagar police station.

1285
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:40,447
Excuse me, sir. - We'll send
you the rest of the things later.

1286
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:43,040
Let's go. - Do come.
We'll surely serve you well.

1287
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,081
Let's go, forget them. - Do come.

1288
01:38:45,486 --> 01:38:47,215
What will we do?
- We'll go to Haryana, sir.

1289
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:50,616
Have some more drink.
Make us suffer a little more.

1290
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:54,285
Pinto...

1291
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:56,952
This is good. Haryana police
is taking away the money and...

1292
01:38:57,131 --> 01:39:00,396
...this Mumbai police will kill us.
Sir... do something.

1293
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:03,361
Pinto... why are you getting upset?
Listen to me.

1294
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:33,260
Why did you stop the car?
- Look at that red car.

1295
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:39,067
This will be our police van.

1296
01:39:41,175 --> 01:39:42,699
4084?

1297
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:45,538
Where is our 4084?
- Your car is stolen.

1298
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,175
4084?

1299
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:51,048
Sir, this is our van.

1300
01:39:54,088 --> 01:39:56,818
Sir, they too are fake police

1301
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:04,090
Mumbai police!
Stop! Otherwise, I'll shoot...

1302
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:11,535
Mumbai police!
Stop! Otherwise, I'll shoot...

1303
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:48,797
Here, we've stopped.
What will you do now?

1304
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:53,105
You had said there are only 2 men.

1305
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:07,826
Run!

1306
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:16,403
Sir, you had said there are 2 men.

1307
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:19,197
Will the men become less if
you repeatedly say the same thing?

1308
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:23,298
You all leave. I'll go and
kill them all! Catch those idiots.

1309
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:27,137
You go and look after uncle!
- He has gone insane!

1310
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:34,948
You go over there!

1311
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:44,896
Come Mumbai police. Have
a one to one meeting with me too.

1312
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:46,593
From behind.

1313
01:41:58,378 --> 01:41:59,640
Penalty kick.

1314
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:02,645
Goal!

1315
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:14,760
No, no, no, no.
Look, I'm not a policeman.

1316
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:16,259
Uncle! - No!

1317
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:20,426
What happened? - I've found one
of them here! Shall I shoot him?

1318
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:21,931
No, get him here!

1319
01:42:22,102 --> 01:42:24,036
Go and see. - I'll kill him.

1320
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:25,296
From behind.

1321
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:26,769
No!

1322
01:42:29,743 --> 01:42:32,075
Brother, please don't shoot.

1323
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:33,873
You had said,
there will be only 2 men.

1324
01:42:34,047 --> 01:42:35,810
He alone is equivalent to 2 men.

1325
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:40,046
Brother... brother, you...

1326
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:44,324
Mumbai Police, glad to meet you.

1327
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:46,186
Listen... Iook...

1328
01:42:48,128 --> 01:42:51,154
Are you glad to meet me?

1329
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,635
Why didn't you shoot?
Why didn't you shoot?

1330
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:06,903
No, no, no, no!
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

1331
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,843
Look, I fell by mistake.
It dropped by mistake!

1332
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,415
I held you by mistake.
Sorry, sorry. - Come out!

1333
01:43:10,584 --> 01:43:12,848
I'm coming out, I'm coming out.
- Come out! Come out.

1334
01:43:13,253 --> 01:43:15,517
How many of you are there?

1335
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:18,624
Grab him. Grab him properly.
- No, no, no, no!

1336
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:21,449
Come!

1337
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:24,662
Now, it's my turn, you idiot!

1338
01:43:35,509 --> 01:43:36,942
Sir...

1339
01:43:55,362 --> 01:44:00,129
Pinto, Pinto! Pinto! - Sir!

1340
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:03,195
What are you doing over there?
- Sir, Rambo's down there.

1341
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:04,962
He'll not die so easily.

1342
01:44:25,058 --> 01:44:28,323
Bobby... no, that's my name. Pinto!

1343
01:44:30,497 --> 01:44:32,863
Where will Mahesh run off?

1344
01:44:41,008 --> 01:44:43,135
Go inside!
Let's go inside! - Hurry up!

1345
01:44:54,021 --> 01:44:56,216
Idiots!
I won't spare anyone of you!

1346
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:07,559
You're police but behaving like
mice. Where are you all hiding?

1347
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:11,098
Sir...

1348
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:29,644
You came in uninvited.

1349
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,154
Lawyer without a tie,
where are you hiding? Come out!

1350
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:35,760
Listen... listen... listen!
How many of you are there?

1351
01:45:35,929 --> 01:45:36,918
What will you do by knowing?

1352
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,597
Will you take us to
a marriage procession?

1353
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:42,199
Look, I've never fired a gun.
It got fired by mistake!

1354
01:45:42,402 --> 01:45:45,303
Look, I'm telling you. It's not a
piston. It's a gun. Give it to me!

1355
01:45:45,505 --> 01:45:47,302
Don't pull the trigger!
- Yes, that is what I am saying.

1356
01:45:47,507 --> 01:45:48,599
It can get fired again by mistake.

1357
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:50,106
You wait!

1358
01:45:51,745 --> 01:45:53,975
Tell me what are these? - I've been
telling you from the beginning.

1359
01:45:54,147 --> 01:45:55,239
These are two, my brother.

1360
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:57,679
I am not asking you
how many these are! I

1361
01:45:57,851 --> 01:45:59,250
Tell me what are they called!

1362
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,754
These aren't potatoes.
These are grenades.

1363
01:46:01,955 --> 01:46:02,944
You'll be shred to
pieces because of these.

1364
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:04,590
I'm telling you, drop the gun!
- This isn't a gun.

1365
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:06,520
This is a bamboo staff!
I'll hit you with this!

1366
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:08,183
Are you insane? - I'll hit you!

1367
01:46:12,733 --> 01:46:15,293
Did you get hurt? Nice and hot.

1368
01:46:23,844 --> 01:46:25,243
Turn! Turn!

1369
01:46:27,614 --> 01:46:29,138
Extinguish it!

1370
01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:41,683
Oh, no! What will happen now?

1371
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:50,025
Don't go over there!
There are grenades over there!

1372
01:47:21,568 --> 01:47:22,626
Sir...

1373
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,703
Hey! Where are you
going with the bag?

1374
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:33,135
Go! I'll take care of him! You go!

1375
01:47:41,755 --> 01:47:44,246
How many of you are there?

1376
01:47:50,797 --> 01:47:52,424
Sir...

1377
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:54,932
Pinto...

1378
01:47:55,101 --> 01:47:56,534
Pinto!

1379
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:58,964
Sir...

1380
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:04,009
Pinto, the remaining
bags are in 4084.

1381
01:48:04,211 --> 01:48:06,475
Quickly go and bring them!
Give it to me.

1382
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:32,336
Just my hands are
enough to kill you.

1383
01:48:34,908 --> 01:48:36,773
Let's go! What are you doing here?

1384
01:48:36,977 --> 01:48:38,945
Police is searching for 2512.
We'll get caught.

1385
01:48:41,381 --> 01:48:42,973
Hurry up, hurry up!

1386
01:49:02,502 --> 01:49:05,596
Kabbbadi, Kabbadi, Kabbadi,
Kabbadi... Hit me! Hit me! Hit me!

1387
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:07,367
You got hurt, didn't you?

1388
01:49:09,175 --> 01:49:12,042
Don't act smart. Bearded man.
Don't act smart, I'm telling you.

1389
01:49:12,245 --> 01:49:14,179
It's an iron bar. I'll get hurt!

1390
01:49:17,117 --> 01:49:18,880
Sir, sir, these seem
to be more than 200 millions.

1391
01:49:19,085 --> 01:49:21,553
There are still more. Pinto
is bringing them. Go and help him!

1392
01:49:24,758 --> 01:49:27,522
Pinto, it's very heavy, isn't it?
- Yes, hold it.

1393
01:49:27,694 --> 01:49:29,559
Go, hurry up! Don't drop it.

1394
01:49:48,481 --> 01:49:54,351
Show me your strength now.

1395
01:50:02,462 --> 01:50:03,986
Sir, take this.

1396
01:50:04,164 --> 01:50:06,962
Hey! - Oh, no...

1397
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:10,797
What were you thinking?
You'll take money and run away?

1398
01:50:11,004 --> 01:50:12,403
Mahesh!

1399
01:50:15,075 --> 01:50:18,408
This is very heavy sir.

1400
01:50:18,578 --> 01:50:23,641
Sir, there are 200 millions inside.
200 millions.

1401
01:50:23,817 --> 01:50:27,184
Let's distribute equally. What
can't happen with 200 millions?

1402
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,919
Yes, you can have
a house in this city.

1403
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:30,111
We'll build a farmhouse
outside the city.

1404
01:50:30,590 --> 01:50:32,023
Sir, this bag is very heavy.

1405
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,921
There can be imported
cars in the parking lot.

1406
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:35,822
We'll eat daily
in a five star hotel.

1407
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,792
And we deserve a foreign trip,
sir. - Yes.

1408
01:50:37,998 --> 01:50:39,488
This bag is very heavy, sir!

1409
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:51,408
What are you all watching?
It's my daily job.

1410
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:54,011
Lift this bag and keep it inside.

1411
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:58,446
What are you looking at?
C'mon! - Yes.

1412
01:51:03,757 --> 01:51:05,281
It's heavy, let me help.

1413
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:09,518
We're in a mess.

1414
01:51:20,607 --> 01:51:23,440
200 millions! 200 millions!

1415
01:51:25,979 --> 01:51:28,243
I'll tell you what
we've to do next.

1416
01:51:49,069 --> 01:51:50,559
Only this much?

1417
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:54,468
Bye, bye. Bye! - This isn't fair.

1418
01:51:59,846 --> 01:52:02,872
My setting,
setting, setting is done

1419
01:52:03,049 --> 01:52:03,981
My setting...

1420
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:05,651
My setting is done

1421
01:52:05,852 --> 01:52:07,911
Setting... setting... setting...

1422
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,923
One night, one night

1423
01:52:17,097 --> 01:52:19,930
One hell of a ride

1424
01:52:20,533 --> 01:52:23,297
4084!

1425
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:26,337
One night, one night

1426
01:52:26,506 --> 01:52:29,441
One hell of a ride

1427
01:52:30,009 --> 01:52:32,773
4084!

1428
01:53:00,573 --> 01:53:01,699
What will happen?

1429
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:03,536
We haven't given a thought

1430
01:53:03,743 --> 01:53:06,735
We've no one to look after us

1431
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:10,178
Our life's like this

1432
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:11,983
Superb!

1433
01:53:13,086 --> 01:53:16,283
Squeezed the lemon into the Rum

1434
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:19,549
Added soda to it

1435
01:53:19,759 --> 01:53:22,455
Fired a gun without a bullet

1436
01:53:22,662 --> 01:53:24,994
What an idea!

1437
01:53:26,166 --> 01:53:29,067
Our van has now started running

1438
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:31,494
Just like a Ferrari!

1439
01:53:32,505 --> 01:53:33,995
Highway is in front

1440
01:53:34,174 --> 01:53:36,665
And adjacent to me is Baby!

1441
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:41,871
Break all the signals

1442
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:45,380
Press the accelerator

1443
01:53:45,585 --> 01:53:47,815
Speed up the van

1444
01:53:51,224 --> 01:53:52,953
Shoot!

1445
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:54,457
Make your life!

1446
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,151
And speed up!

1447
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:02,964
One night, one night

1448
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:06,735
One hell of a ride

1449
01:54:06,906 --> 01:54:09,602
4084!

1450
01:54:09,776 --> 01:54:12,711
One night, one night

1451
01:54:12,879 --> 01:54:15,871
One hell of a ride

1452
01:54:16,482 --> 01:54:19,144
4084!

1453
01:54:19,352 --> 01:54:20,683
One night!

1454
01:54:20,887 --> 01:54:22,411
4084!

1455
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:25,381
4084!

1456
01:54:26,059 --> 01:54:28,289
4084!

1457
01:54:29,128 --> 01:54:32,222
4084!

1458
01:54:47,780 --> 01:54:50,908
One night, one night

1459
01:54:51,117 --> 01:54:54,314
One hell of a ride

1460
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,216
4084!

1461
01:54:57,390 --> 01:55:00,382
One night, one night

1462
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,961
One hell of a ride

1463
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:06,792
4084!

1464
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,436
One whole night, hold on tight!

1465
01:55:10,637 --> 01:55:13,162
One whole night, hold on tight!

1466
01:55:13,373 --> 01:55:16,206
4084!

1467
01:55:16,576 --> 01:55:19,909
One whole night, hold on tight!

1468
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:23,810
One whole night, hold on tight!

1469
01:55:25,718 --> 01:55:27,777
One night!
