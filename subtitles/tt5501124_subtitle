1
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
I want to play with your baby...

2
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,480
No..please..
Don't do anything to my baby...

3
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,280
Lapachhapi (Hide N Seek)

4
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,800
- Ouch!!
-Is it paining a lot?

5
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,400
No.. Don't worry.. I am fine.

6
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,600
At least tell me what happened?

7
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,000
Neha.. Let it be...

8
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,880
Okay listen..

9
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,520
As I stepped out of the office
Altaf's goons surrounded me,

10
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
and started asking for money...

11
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,640
I requested them to give me some more ti
to arrange for the money

12
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,600
But they were in no mood to listen...
they just started beating me..

13
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,360
How can you be so casual about it?

14
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,520
So what do you want me to do?

15
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,560
So no-one came to your rescue when
all of this was happening?

16
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,000
Bhaurao came at once along
with a couple of other drivers...

17
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,360
Thank god they came on time or else
things would have been worse...

18
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,760
So where are we going now?

19
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,680
Bhaurao is taking us to his village...
it's far away from here...

20
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,480
No-one will come looking for us there...

21
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,480
I have also thrown away the sim-card..
so we can't be traced.

22
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
Where exactly is this village?

23
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,600
My village is quite far...

24
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,760
People in the city wouldn't even
have heard about it...

25
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,560
Those goons will not be able to guess
that you are there.

26
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,760
Don't worry... We'll come back as soon a
things are in control...

27
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,680
You don't need to worry
when I am by your side...

28
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,880
Are you trying to console me or yourself

29
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,440
I am not trying to console either of us.

30
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,040
I know you are not scared
of such small issues...

31
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,160
I have always loved you for your courage

32
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,720
- Tushar, when will we reach?
- I think....

33
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,200
Madam, we are almost there..

34
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,720
Just being careful as the road is bumpy.

35
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,760
-See, we are almost there...

36
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,120
- Drive carefully...
- Sure

37
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,760
(Tushar and Bhaurao murmuring)

38
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,640
We have reached... You must be tired...

39
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,680
Come...

40
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,160
All these fields belong to Bhaurao...

41
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,480
Bhaurao, are you sure
we'll be fine here?

42
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,760
Yes absolutely,

43
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,080
Both me and my wife
will take good care of you...

44
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,280
Don't you worry...

45
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll help you with the luggage...

46
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,320
Let's go...

47
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Sir...You can take that.....

48
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,800
Hey you son of a bitch...
What are you staring at?... Get lost...

49
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Madam.. don't worry...

50
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,200
He is the village fool..
He keeps roaming around...

51
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,680
You stay without fear...
No-one can harm you here...

52
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Do one thing.. Follow that path in the f
It'll lead you to our house...

53
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,840
Here is your bag...
I'll hide the car and come...

54
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
Walk carefully...

55
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,240
There is no network over here...

56
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,720
hmm.. doesn't matter...

57
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,920
Come this way..

58
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,080
Tushar.. we are away from home
in a far-away village among unknown peop

59
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,360
it doesn't feel right...

60
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,560
I've thought hard before taking this dec

61
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,200
I've known Bhaurao since a long time...
and i trust him...

62
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:05,600
You must really trust him a lot to bring
in my eighth month...isn't it?

63
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,760
-Go slow
-Be careful

64
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,760
Neha, do you remember the first time we

65
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,080
Yes, how can i forget?

66
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,120
- I had seen you at the entrance of our 
- hmm

67
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,240
- i still remember how you were staring 
- hmm...

68
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,120
it was love at first sight for me

69
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,080
and you proposed in three days!

70
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
what if someone else had snatched you aw

71
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,080
but you agreed... we got married...

72
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,280
and now you are going to
be the mother of my child..

73
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,840
In this past year,

74
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,400
have I ever given you
a chance to complain?

75
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,160
- you want to know the truth?
- do try

76
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,360
this past year has been the most
beautiful year of my life...

77
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,840
and so will the rest of our life...

78
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,920
- is that so?
- yes absolutely

79
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,480
be careful there...

80
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,720
seems quite far...

81
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,720
yes...

82
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,520
i can finally see something...

83
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,040
Tushar!!

84
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Then who are you?

85
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,120
What?

86
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,680
If you are Tushar then who's this?

87
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,160
No.. you can't be Tushar..

88
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,920
You are an imposter... Tushar!!

89
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,600
Let me set you right...

90
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,400
First find the right path to the house!

91
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,960
I'll find it right away...

92
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,560
-We entered through this path.. right?
- yes

93
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,520
Bhaurao had asked us to follow the path.

94
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,080
But here there are many paths
and each looks the same...

95
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Which one to take?

96
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
I know which one leads to the house...

97
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,680
Which one?

98
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,440
I always knew you were intelligent...

99
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,240
Let me confirm... you rest for a bit her

100
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
Does my baby know
where we have come today?

101
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,920
Your dad will be back soon to take us
to the new house...

102
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,320
Don't be scared...
We'll go and look for dad... Okay?

103
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,160
Tushar?...

104
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,600
Tushar?...

105
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,760
Please don't be scared madam...

106
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,440
What happened Neha?
Are you alright?

107
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,640
Please come in sir...

108
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,880
You would be??

109
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,160
I am Bhalerao's wife

110
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,440
Tulsi...

111
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,440
He had told me that
you would be coming here...

112
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,360
Bless us...

113
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,360
Please let it be...

114
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,600
I am here now...

115
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,440
I will take care of madam...

116
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,360
and also of this little felow...

117
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,280
Please freshen up...

118
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,800
Come dear...

119
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,440
I'll keep dinner ready...

120
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Please have a seat...

121
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,000
Madam.. Can you please
get those plates for dinner?

122
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,040
The sugarcane harvest looks good..

123
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,320
Yes, the rains have been good this year

124
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,880
Looks like good times are upon us...

125
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,480
Please take...

126
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,440
Does anyone live in this house?

127
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,000
We used to stay here till
about 10-12 years back..

128
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,680
What about the other room?

129
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,160
I saw a door on the other
side while coming...

130
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,880
My younger brother used to stay there..

131
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,600
We moved out after he left us...

132
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,840
Where did he go?

133
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,040
He died!!!

134
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,080
Please have the food while its hot...
I hope you like it...

135
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,400
Its really nice...

136
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
So... now this house remains closed?

137
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,400
We opened it only for you guys...

138
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,160
otherwise we would have
never opened it...

139
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,560
But... we didn't see any
other house nearby?

140
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,600
Where do the other villlagers stay?

141
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,160
The houses are in the fields...

142
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,280
But the fields are so vast
that you can't spot them...

143
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,040
But you don't worry at all..

144
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
I will be by your
wife's side all the time...

145
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,240
It will be good for her to have
another woman with her

146
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,920
in this stage of pregnancy...

147
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,800
After all, humanity is all about
helping each other...

148
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,760
Sir here has helped my husband a lot...
now its our turn...

149
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,760
Oh god!!! See what happened?

150
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,040
A little distraction...

151
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,280
and everything burns to ashes...

152
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
Please eat well...

153
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,720
Get a good night's sleep...

154
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,040
Worrying is not good for the baby...

155
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,360
I will be back in the morning... Good ni

156
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
-Let's leave...
-Come

157
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,800
-Let's go inside...

158
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,480
-These people are still stuck
in their age-old traditions...isn't it?

159
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,520
Even today, the wife eats only
after the husband has finished eating...

160
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,840
Anyway, it shouldn't matter to us...
We are here only for a few days...

161
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,160
That's true...
But they are so warm and friendly...

162
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,280
Anyway, mingling with people
comes so naturally to you

163
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,640
You know what I like most about you?

164
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,800
That you build relationships
really fast...

165
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,480
That's what happened in our case too...

166
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,600
But this habit of yours could land you
in trouble someday...

167
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,480
Daddy went off to sleep...

168
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
But you are still awake...
right?

169
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,120
Listening to everything
that your mother has to say..

170
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,960
It's time to sleep now...alright?

171
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:56,720
How did you find these new people?
Bhaurao? Tulsi?

172
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,080
Please let me do it...
I will fill the buckets...

173
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,760
You must not be used to
doing such things in the city...

174
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,760
Oh god! That looks
like a bad wound.

175
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,520
I will get you
some medication to apply on it.

176
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
Don't worry. It has almost healed.

177
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,720
Sir, please come...
I will show you our fields...

178
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
yes.. let's go...

179
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,760
- let me wear my shoes
- Please do

180
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,320
- I will be back

181
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,320
See you soon...

182
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,280
So.... Did you get
good sleep last night?

183
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Yes, I slept alright...

184
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,960
It did take a while to fall asleep...
It's a new place...

185
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,040
You will get used to
the place in a day or two...

186
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
No..
that wouldn't be necessary.

187
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,120
Tushar was saying that
we'll leave at the earliest...

188
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,840
What happened?
Why are you looking at me like this?

189
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,000
Err... No.. Nothing...

190
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,120
here we don't address our husbands
by their first name...

191
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,000
But we call each other
by our first names

192
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,160
Okay, you get ready..
I will also finish my chores...

193
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,960
- Tulsi, even I want to see your fields.

194
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,320
Ahhh... yes... yesss

195
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,800
let's go..
you want to see the fields, right?

196
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,560
I think I should pay a visit
to our home tomorrow only...

197
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,200
For how long can we hide like this?

198
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,760
Some or the other day
we'll have to go back...

199
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,120
Give it a few more days...

200
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,680
Once things get back to normal,
we both will go back together...

201
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,960
No... it's not right to stay
here for long...

202
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,480
let me go and
assess the situation there..

203
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,080
So you are leaving me alone here?
Let me also come along...

204
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,920
That's not possible...

205
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,880
I can't put my son's life
in danger...

206
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,720
And what about me?

207
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,840
I am doing all this for your safety.

208
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,440
I will not be worried
if you are here with Tulsi...

209
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,120
- But...
- Please don't argue.

210
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,680
I have given it a proper thought...

211
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,080
I'll speak to Bhaurao
tomorrow itself..

212
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,160
It's not proper
to stay here for long.

213
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
Excuse me...

214
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,760
He thinks he has taken a right decision.

215
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,760
But what about consulting us?

216
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,480
Neha.. I promise I'll be
back in a day...

217
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,000
Why are you not understanding?
Please trust me...

218
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,640
Just one day!
Neha.. please...

219
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,640
Mind your step...

220
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,560
Hmm...

221
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,800
If the mother is angry
then the kid is also angry...

222
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,120
If the mother is upset
then the kid is also upset...

223
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,200
Only if the mother is happy then
the kid will also be happy...

224
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,480
Let me tell your child a story...

225
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,200
Hey little one...

226
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Are you excited to hear a story?

227
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,920
Yes??? The baby is saying yes...

228
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,000
- Is it?
- yes

229
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,600
Once upon a time in a small village,
there was a big tree.

230
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,280
The tree had lush-green leaves
and sweet juicy fruits.

231
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,760
That tree was really beautiful.

232
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,200
On that tree, there was a crow
with his family.

233
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,640
They lived there happily.

234
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,960
And then one day...

235
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:24,000
A black poisonous snake
wrapped itself around the tree.

236
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,920
The snake's poison started spreading.

237
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,880
The leaves started drying up.

238
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,880
The fruits started rotting.

239
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,880
The lush-green tree started turning blac

240
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,040
The snake had his eyes set
on the crow's nest.

241
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,160
As soon as the crow's eggs hatched,
the snake would gobble up the babies.

242
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,080
The crow was very worried...

243
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,080
But one day, a sparrow came
to live on the tree...

244
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,080
She also built a small nest for her fami

245
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,560
And laid a small egg in the nest.

246
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,040
The crow had an idea.

247
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,800
The crow transferred his egg
to the sparrow's nest

248
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,360
And brought the
sparrow's egg to his nest.

249
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,240
As soon as the egg hatched,
the snake gobbled up the baby..

250
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,400
But the crow's egg was safe
in the sparrow's nest...

251
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,520
The egg hatched
into a beautiful baby crow.

252
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,000
The crow lived happily
ever after with his family.

253
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,560
-Here
- For me?

254
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
- yes
- No i can't take this.

255
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,160
Am I not like your mother?

256
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,120
Then please accept it...

257
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,800
I wanted to ask you something...

258
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,360
Who is more evil?
The black crow or the black snake?

259
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,080
Do wear this saree... ok?

260
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,440
Thanks to you I did not feel
the absence of a mother today...

261
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,160
I am glad. Now you better spend
some time with your husband.

262
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,320
He has to leave early in the morning.

263
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,280
Go on.

264
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
- Move aside. I'll pack your bag.
-Okay

265
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,320
Thank you

266
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,920
I just said 'Thank you'

267
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,880
Are you still upset?

268
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,800
I told you I'll be back in a day...

269
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,280
Don't let me go like this.
I'll be worried all the time.

270
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,320
You don't need to worry at all.

271
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
I did not want to be alone here...

272
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,640
But in Tulsi's company,
one day is manageable...

273
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,560
Absolutely correct

274
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,720
And listen...

275
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,920
-Do not forget an important thing...
-hmmm

276
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,440
Your wife and your little one ...

277
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,720
will be waiting here for you...

278
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,160
of course...

279
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,320
I will return soon for my son...

280
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,000
How many times have i told you
not to refer the baby as 'son'..

281
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,240
I am very sure
that it will be a boy

282
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,000
be it a girl or a boy,
it'll be our baby...

283
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
Isn't it beautiful enough?

284
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,120
-Got it?
- No...

285
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,080
- Do you get me?
- Not at all...

286
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,600
-So you don't get me.. is it?
- No

287
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,040
Then go away...

288
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,760
Listen...

289
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,160
What are you doing here?

290
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,440
I.... I was putting clothes to dry...

291
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,720
let's go inside...
it's too hot out here...

292
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,560
come... come let's go...

293
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,080
That woman you saw there...

294
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,640
She is my daugher-in-law...

295
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,600
My son Pratap's wife...

296
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,320
Her name is Laxmi...

297
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,760
A few years back...

298
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,360
we thought we would be blessed
with a baby in our family...

299
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Laxmi was pregnant back then...

300
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,080
We were all very happy...

301
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,680
I took good care of her...

302
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,320
Gave her all the love in the world...

303
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,440
In the eighth month of her pregnancy...

304
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,440
She slipped and fell in the fields...

305
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,520
She fell on her pregnant belly...

306
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,280
It was an accident...

307
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,080
a horrific accident...

308
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,920
the belly had to be cut open
to remove the dead baby...

309
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,600
Laxmi was so devastated..

310
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,800
that she just stopped talking...

311
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,280
She hasn't spoken a word till date...

312
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,120
Our happiness got ruined...

313
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,600
And what about your son?

314
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,160
He... works in the city...

315
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,200
He visits us once in a while...

316
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,920
What's left for him here?

317
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,600
There's nothing left for him here...

318
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,160
Nothing at all...

319
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,160
Please don't cry...

320
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,920
Tushar and me are like your son
and daughter-in-law.. Isn't it?

321
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,200
Hmm?

322
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,360
You are like a grandmother
to our baby...

323
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,520
Should I light the fire?

324
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,600
Where's the firewood?

325
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,760
Since when I had told Laxmi
to get the firewood...

326
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,200
but she doesn't listen...

327
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,200
I don't know what she's upto the whole d

328
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,080
She's become a burden on us...

329
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,560
She's good for nothing...

330
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,920
Where were you all this while?

331
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,520
Stop staring and put it down...

332
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,640
Can't you hear me?

333
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,400
What are you staring at?

334
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,560
Get out...

335
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,840
get out and stay there...

336
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,560
Wait ouside the door...
I'll come in a bit...

337
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,120
What is bothering you now?

338
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,040
That cursed woman?

339
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,560
Stop thinking about her...

340
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,480
I am coming..You wait right there...

341
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,040
You know how it is...

342
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,440
a person has to accept his own fate...

343
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,160
You don't need to overthink..
It's not good for your health...

344
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,000
Oh god!! This woman
just doesn't understand...

345
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,200
I am coming.. For God's sake...

346
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,520
Listen.. i'll just visit my house
for a bit...

347
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,880
And tonight I'll give you company here..

348
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,200
Don't you worry...

349
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,720
Just keep an eye on this..
it's almost done...

350
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,280
I'll be back in a bit...

351
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,760
Laxmi...Tulsi left for home already...

352
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,680
She has left already..

353
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,760
you naughty boy... Wait!
Where are you going?

354
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,320
Hey...

355
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,440
What happened?...
Hope you are fine...

356
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,280
Yes... But the kids here are so naughty.

357
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,400
Kids??

358
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,360
Kids!!!

359
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,360
- Come let's go inside.
- What's wrong?

360
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,400
What happened?

361
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,800
The kids had come?
How many of them?

362
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,880
Just one...

363
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,240
Did he come near you?

364
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,120
No... He ran away from a distance...

365
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,560
Listen... Don't go near those kids...

366
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,680
Today he was alone..
Next time there will be three of them...

367
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,000
You better stay away from them...

368
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,160
But he was such a sweet boy...

369
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,520
In fact, he wanted to play with me...
Why should I stay away from them?

370
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,240
Can't you understand what I am saying...
Just stay away from them...

371
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,360
Look. I don't have answers
to all of your questions..

372
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,880
Do as I say...

373
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,400
Stay away from those kids..
Understood?

374
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,120
I think I should go to sleep....

375
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,880
Yes... go and sleep...

376
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,560
You?..

377
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,680
You haven't slept yet!!

378
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:35,800
No

379
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,160
I just couldn't sleep...

380
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,640
You sleep...

381
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,440
Sleep...

382
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,840
Why din't you sleep last night?

383
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,800
I woke up a couple of times
and saw you awake...

384
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,080
I couldn't sleep a wink last night...

385
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,040
Stop asking me the same thing
again and again...

386
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,880
Come in..

387
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,080
Why do you need to come here
again and again?

388
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,520
Go away!

389
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,200
hmm.. take it and leave...

390
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,320
Go and tell her...

391
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,240
Tell her to finish all the pending work.
tell her it's my order...

392
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,440
She has become such a pain...

393
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,200
Hey...

394
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Everyone, Go and hide...

395
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,760
I am coming to find you...

396
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,720
Here I come!!

397
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,840
Here I come!! Here I come!!

398
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,240

Come O mother!! Play with us...

402
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,480
Why are you running away?

403
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,760
Hey wait...

404
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,320
Where are they hiding?

405
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,240
caught you...

406
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,880
What are you upto?

407
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,080
And the little pests gave you this...

408
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,880
- those kids
- Kids !! Kids!! Kids!!

409
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,120
Didn't I tell you to stay away from them

410
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,320
Can't you understand or what?

411
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,040
Give that thing to me...

412
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,480
Please don't behave like this...

413
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,400
These things that I tell you to do...

414
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,080
are for your own good...

415
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,360
Just let it be!!!

416
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,960
Stop pretending..

417
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,040
The way you treat Laxmi
shows who you really are...

418
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,920
Don't show fake concern and love...

419
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,040
Stop it !

420
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,400
Are you out of your mind?

421
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,800
That female is cursed...
She can't have kids anymore...

422
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,520
Stop this nonsense!
I don't believe in such things...

423
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,040
She is like any other woman...

424
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,080
Listen to me...

425
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,960
Your city talks are all crap...
Don't teach me...

426
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,400
Once you deliver...

427
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,080
you will understand...

428
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,280
What?.. What will I understand?

429
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,320
why don't you tell me?

430
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,000
Your husband...

431
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,040
wants a son...

432
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,680
Right?

433
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,920
How do you know?

434
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,040
I know everything...

435
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,640
you know what?

436
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,920
You are not going to deliver a boy...

437
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,360
It's a girl ! I know that

438
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,800
Stop bluffing....

439
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,200
I am not bluffing..

440
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,640
We are village women..

441
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,480
We can accurately gauge from
the pregnant woman's appearance..

442
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,120
We are never wrong...

443
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,120
Listen girl... When your husband
will come to know...

444
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,920
That its a girl and not a boy..

445
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,240
He'll not like it at all...

446
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,760
Stop it ! Your thoughts are so dirty...

447
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,160
Come out of your false world to reality.

448
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,480
It's not me but you who is living
in a false world...

449
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,160
You won't believe me now....

450
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,440
let the baby come...

451
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,600
You will understand the reality...

452
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,520
Tulsi- Hey girl...

453
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,120
Tulsi- Come out and have some food...

454
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,160
Daddy will be here soon...
And we'll all fly away together

455
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,040
don't worry..your mom is here with you..

456
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,480
Tulsi- Listen to me and come out..

457
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,040
(humming the song)

458
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,800
Come and play with us...

459
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,440

- your wounds have healed..

463
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,400
Tushar!!

464
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,280
- then they will heal faster

465
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,520
Careful... Slowly...

466
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,040
What happened Neha?

467
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,560
Tell me what hapenned...

468
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,640
What happened Neha?

469
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,080
i allowed you to stay here...

470
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,120
took care of you like a mother..

471
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,280
But this girl... talks ill of me...

472
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,120
This woman is such a liar!!

473
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,200
What!   I am lying?

474
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,680
yes.. I am a liar...
it's all my fault...

475
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,560
Treating you like a daughter was my mist

476
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,880
Don't listen to her..
She is just putting up an act...

477
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,680
Neha.. you calm down...

478
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,440
They have helped us so much..
and you are doubting them?

479
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,080
-Apologise right away...
-No

480
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,960
- Neha, I asked you to apologise..
- No i won't

481
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,400
I am sorry.. Please forgive me...

482
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,360
It's alright.. Let it be...

483
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,640
Can I ever get angry with you?

484
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,160
You are just like my daughter...

485
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,840
I'll leave now.. Let the
prince and princess be together now...

486
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,240
My sweet little baby...

487
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,440
-Go carefully...
-Yes

488
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,120
Don't listen to her sweet talks...

489
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,960
She's a very strange woman...

490
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,240
I am very scared of her...

491
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,360
What are you talking about?

492
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,320
I am telling you what I have sensed...

493
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,240
She has her own reasons to look after me

494
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,440
She has an eye on me all the time...

495
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,120
Why?

496
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,920
Her daughter-in-law cannot deliver
So she is after our baby...

497
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,080
Tulsi??

498
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,320
Yes. Tulsi..

499
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,200
Tushar, i don't want to stay here.
Please let's leave..

500
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,680
Listen.. I know you won't believe me
right now..

501
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,040
But I don't want to be here..
Please take me away from here...

502
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,600
Calm down Neha..

503
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,240
Don't tell me to calm down...
I don't want to stay here.

504
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,280
Neha, listen to me...

505
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,640
You don't have to be scared
when I am around..

506
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,640
Then why are you scared right now?

507
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,840
Come here.. sit down...
Relax....

508
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,360
there is nothing to be scared of..
Nothing will happen to you...

509
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,840
-How many times have I told you that....

510
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,080
She is outside and listening to our conv

511
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:01,920
Who's outside?

512
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,320
Come and check for yourself...

513
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,000
There is no-one outside..
It's all in your mind...

514
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,720
I am not imagining things...

515
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,240
I have met Laxmi and those innocent kids

516
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,040
Tushar, i don't want to stay here.
Please let's leave..

517

Nothing will happen...

521
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,200
Come .. Slowly...

522
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,400
Tushar!!!

Tushar!!!

524
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,760
Tushar!!!

525
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,960
Many years back...

526
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,760
Bhaurao's younger brother...

527
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,280
His name was Kedarrao

528
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,480
He got married to a girl...

529
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,320
her name was Kaveri...

530
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,840
But she turned out to be a witch...

531
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:38,320
She stepped into our life
and ruined our happiness...

532
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,240
Not one or two.. but four

533
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,960
I was a proud mother of four 'sons'...

534
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,360
The eldest was Pratap
and his three younger brothers...

535
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,880
Kaveri cast a spell on my three younger

536
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,040
They started behaving possessed...

537
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:06,360
She spoke ill about me to my own childre

538
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,480
My sons started staying away from me...

539
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,640
They started roaming around
with her all the time

540
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,040
I didn't know how to get them back...

541
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,480
Then she got pregnant...

542
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,880
I heaved a sigh of relief

543
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,680
i thought now she'll let go of my kids..

544
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,240
But I was wrong...

545
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,200
Nothing of that sort happened...

546
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,080
I took the matter up with her husband...

547
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,840
I made him understand...

548
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,480
He also tried to make her understand...

549
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,440
But she did not listen to anyone...

550
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,640
She was too stubborn...

551
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,960
The two of them had a huge fight...

552
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,120
The witch killed her own husband...

553
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,080
we heard the man screaming
and rushed at once...

554
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,560
I asked her 'how could
she kill such a nice man?'

555
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,760
In reply she started abusing me...

556
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,840
and then she did the unthinkable...

557
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:19,320
She took the blood-stained knife ..

558
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,400
and stabbed her pregnant belly with it..

559
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,040
We were shocked...

560
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:35,080
When we tried to help her,
she cut her throat...

561
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,000
The witch died...

562
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,480
but her evil spell still looms here...

563
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,880
Even after she was gone,
my kids did not change...

564
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,160
They spoke of playing with her
in the fields...

565
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,200
One day when i woke up...

566
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,160
there was an eerie silence all around...

567
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,480
The witch drowned my three sons
in the well...

568
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,040
A few years later, my eldest son

569
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,520
Pratap married Laxmi...

570
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,360
And when she was eight months pregnant..

571
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,600
She started seeing the witch
and my dead kids...

572
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,600
Laxmi also came under her spell...

573
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,720
She also stabbed her pregnant belly...

574
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,480
She couldn't get pregnant anymore,

575
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,680
I got my unhappy son married again..
not once but twice...

576
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:01,280
Both the times, the witch killed
the unborn babies...

577
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,560
I took the challenge...

578
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:17,520
Once again I got my son married
But this time I sent him off to the city

579
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,520
The village godman has shown us the way.

580
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,360
If any pregnant woman...

581
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,200
survives in this house
for three days all by herself...

582
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,680
without getting influenced by the witch.

583
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:40,040
Then our family will be free of the evil

584
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,200
And as fate would have it...

585
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,000
Tushar and you came at the right time...

586
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,600
Do you know the good news?

587
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,240
My son Pratap's wife is also pregnant...

588
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,480
She is safe in the city...

589
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,240
If you manage to save your baby...

590
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,920
from that witch...

591
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:15,720
Then the spell will be broken forever...

592
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,600
My family will get a heir...

593
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,520
I will also become a grandmother...

594
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,240
You are a mother...

595
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,760
and so am I...

596
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,680
I hope you understand that
I am doing all this for my son...

597
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,880
You stay here...

598
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,200
and save your baby...

599
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,840
and solve my problem...

600
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,160
If you try to run away...

601
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,560
My son Pratap will not spare you...

602
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,600
take care of yourself...

603
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,920
and remember one thing...

604
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,160
The song that you heard...

605
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,840
Do not sing that...

606
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,840
Kaveri used to sing that
song for my kids...

607
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,320
She sings even today...

608
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,200
I'll leave now...

609
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,040
be careful...

610
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,600
Tushar !

611
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,440
Tushar !

612
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,280
Tushar !

613
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,320
Tushar !

614
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,840
Tushar !

615
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,960
Tushar !

616
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,800
Tushar !

617
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,960
Everyone, Go and hide...

618
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,360
I am coming to find you...

619
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,280
Here I come!!

620
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,200
Here I come!! Here I come!!
Here I come!!

621
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:49,560
A game of Hide and Seek...

622
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,240
Do not get scared...

623
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,760
I have never seen a baby girl...

624
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,040
What do they look like?

625
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,400
Tell me..

626
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,760
Why are you not saying anything?

627
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,720
She tells us...

628
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,400
that baby girls are very sweet...

629
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,960
Beautiful eyes...

630
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,160
Long hair...

631
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,800
and an innocent smile...

632
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,480
Are they very delicate?

633
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,280
You have a girl in there.. right?

634
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,760
They will take her away...

635
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,480
But you don't worry...

636
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,920
We are there for you...

637
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:18,840
(Lullaby starts playing
- A game of Hide and Seek...)

638
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,920
She's here...

639
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:24,920
(Lullaby-Come and play with us...)
- Come to play with us...

640
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:30,280
(Lullaby- Everyday it's a new game of ..

641
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:35,400
(Lullaby- Come O mother!! Play with us..

642
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,040
No... No... This can't be real...

643
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,320
It's all an illusion...

644
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,880
Tulsi had said that
I'll see the kids..

645
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,600
But it'll be an illusion...

646
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,040
This can't be real for sure...

647
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,800
No..... that way...

648
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,680
Which way should I go?
Tushar!!

649
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:38,040
(Distant voices)

650
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,240
Tulsi- She must be at the house...
Bhaurao- Is it?

651
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,360
Tulsi- I saw her running away...
Bhaurao- How dare she do that?

652
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:51,760
Tulsi- We can't let her go
Bhaurao- We'll find that bitch..

653
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:03,440
Tulsi- How dare she run away?
Bhaurao- She must be around here....

654
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,280
Tulsi- She must be in this room
Bhaurao- Check it...

655
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,520
Tulsi- She's definitely here
Bhaurao- Open the door quick...

656
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,200
Check the room, Pratap....

657
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,440
She must be here only...

658
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,240
- Get the fuel..
- How dare she escape?

659
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,000
Check in that corner...

660
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,160
See there she is..
Pull her out...

661
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,600
She has killed my brother

662
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,640
Please let me go...
Please..

663
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,960
I have not killed him...

664
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,080
-Take this...
- Don't listen to her..

665
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,680
No please don't do this...
For my baby's sake...

666
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,080
Everyone, Go and hide...

667
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,600
I am coming to find you...

668
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,240
Here I come!!

669
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,360
Here I come!! Here I come!!
Here I come!!

670
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:52,720
A game of Hide and Seek...

671
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:57,800
Come and play with us...

672
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:03,040
Everyday it's a new game of ........(ina

Everyone, Go and hide...

686
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,000
I am coming to find you...

687
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,200
Laxmi...

688
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,320
Pratap...

689
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,240
these women are of no use
to us anymore...

690
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,720
If we let them free then
they might ruin our plans...

691
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,880
- better you finish them off...
- hmmm

692
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,200
All these illusions
definitely mean something...

693
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,320
She has called for you...

694
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,960
Everyone, Go and hide...

695
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,480
I am coming to find you...

696
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,320
Here I come!!

697
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,440
Here I come!! Here I come!!
Here I come!!

698
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:39,200
A game of Hide and Seek...

699
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,880
Come and play with us...

700
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:50,360
Everyday it's a new game of illusions...

701
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:55,680
Come O mother!! Play with us...

702
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,880
You have a girl in there.. right?

703
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,320
Hmmm

704
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,320
What does a baby girl look like?

705
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,000
Baby girls look very sweet...

706
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,040
Beautiful eyes...

707
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,600
Long hair...

708
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,240
Plaits..

709
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,960
and an innocent smile...

710
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,320
But baby girls are very delicate...

711
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,920
But will they take her away as well?

712
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,600
I'll not let anyone take away
my daughter...

713
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,080
You don't worry...

714
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,640
We are there for you...

715
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,040
I want to play with your baby...

716
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,320
Yes... We all will play together...

717
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,440
Come... See for yourself...

718
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,600
She just doesn't seem to understand...

719
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,800
See how she has hypnotised my kids...

720
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,120
Have a look...

721
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,440
hey you there...

722
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,600
Haven't I made it clear...

723
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,120
that we'll have to take away
our daughter...

724
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,640
It's a part of our tradition...

725
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,600
We have been following it
for generations...

726
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,320
Why are you teaching wrong things
to these kids?

727
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:41,000
Are you out of your mind?

728
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,960
She herself is carrying a 'girl'...
But look at her audacity...

729
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,480
She won't understand like that...
Beat the hell out of her...

730
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,680
High time I set her straight...

731
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,840
-You bitch....
- No.Please don't..

732
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:52,720
No.. I'll not kill my girl...

733
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:07,240
Tushar !! they are after our baby....

734
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:14,800
But I'll not let anything
happen to our baby..

735
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:21,240
The kids... they jumped...

736
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:26,200
They burnt her alive...

737
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,160
Tushar!!

738
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,160
Tushar, Kaveri's husband
did wrong with her..

739
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:38,560
The kids jumped in the well...

740
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:45,040
This place is really horrific..
I don't want to be here...

741
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:51,080
This place is really horrific..
I don't want to be here...

742
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,680
Don't be scared...

743
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,040
The three days are over...

744
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,520
You survived...

745
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,480
and your baby girl
has also survived...

746
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,520
-My daughter?
-Yes

747
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,120
My daughter!!

748
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,640
Where is my daughter?
Where is she?

749
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,840
She is here only...

750
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,240
playing with my son Pratap...

751
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,000
Go and see her...

752
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:49,640
Go...

753
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,200
See her for the first
and last time...

754
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,960
This time also the harvest will be good
and we'll prosper...

755
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,640
My baby!!!

756
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,400
My baby!!!

757
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,640
Where do you think you are going?

758
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,160
Let me go..
He has my baby...

759
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:37,800
Shut up !

760
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:41,280
Pratap, keep the tradition going...

761
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,760
-Let me go...
-Stop

762
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,360
What are you doing?
That's my baby...

763
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,400
My baby!!!

764
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,320
My baby!!!

765
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,600
i can't take it any more

766
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,440
i can't

767
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,280
I want to play with your baby...

768
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,560
I will not kill my baby...

769
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,480
I will not kill my baby...

770
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:41,880
Neha..

771
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,240
Are you okay?

772
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,960
These guys set me free
just now...

773
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:49,560
The last three days have been
miserable for me...

774
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,000
But now that I have seen you
and our baby, I feel relieved...

775
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:54,760
Hey Neha...

776
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,840
What happened?

777
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,440
What's wrong with you?

778
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,800
Careful...

779
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,840
What happened?

780
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:42,440
That day you had told me a story..

781
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,000
Today I'll tell you one...

782
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,320
The only difference is that...

783
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,240
Your story was incomplete...

784
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,960
Mine is complete...

785
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,120
Your story was a lie...

786
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,880
Mine is the truth...

787
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,600
Neha...What story?

788
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,080
What is going on?

789
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:12,800
These people burned a woman
alive in her eighth month...

790
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,880
No, What you are saying is wrong...

791
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:19,960
Wrong??

792
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,240
It's your traditions
that are wrong...

793
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,480
which enslaves women...

794
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:31,760
Baby girls are sacrificed
for better harvest...

795
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,680
which you did

796
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:34,920
Nonsense!!

797
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,800
You won't understand
our tradition and Culture..

798
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,600
We have survived due to
the roots of our traditions..

799
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,600
It is said that a woman's worst enemy
is another woman...

800
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:53,240
Women like you can kill young girls
for your own survival...

801
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,160
hey girl.

802
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,240
it's not killing

803
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,160
thats our tradition

804
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,520
we have to do this sacrifice

805
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,360
for God's sake we have to sacrifice life

806
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:05,600
Sacrifice !?

807
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:06,280
yes

808
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,160
"Sacrifice!?"
Words like these don't suit you

809
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,840
-Stop it right there...
-Why?

810
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,000
You want to silence me as well?

811
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,240
The same way you silenced
Kaveri and the other women...

812
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,480
You burned Kaveri alive...

813
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,520
She tried her best
to save her baby till end

814
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,120
but in those three days
no one bothered to see her

815
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:37,880
She died....

816
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,640
But her story is still alive...

817
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:43,880
The echoes of her story...

818
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,600
were heard by every pregnant woman..

819
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,280
who stepped in this house...

820
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,520
but no-one understood her pain...

821
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,800
which story?
what pain?

822
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,560
hmm...

823
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,360
and what's our fault ?

824
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,880
She killed my brother...

825
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,680
How could we spare her?

826
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:11,080
That's true..I saw her
killing Kedarrao with my own eyes...

827
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,680
Sometimes what we see
can be an illusion too...

828
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:14,440
illusion ?

829
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:19,480
Kaveri showed me her true story
through illusions in these three days..

830
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:24,160
because of your behaviour
you spoiled my status in village

831
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,800
you have not even follwed our old tradit

832
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:30,080
i just want to save my girl child...

833
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,040
you have crossed all limits
i wont spare you today

834
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,080
hey kids, watch this.

835
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:46,320
whoever will go against our
family traditions will suffer like this

836
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,800
I can't bear your antics anymore...
I get insulted by my elders

837
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,520
I See !

838
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,600
you want to kill me?
Go ahead..

839
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,480
don't  kill my daughter

840
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,120
don't  kill  her

841
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,600
I will not spare you now,
I will kill you

842
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:11,600
Leave me

843
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,720
Run, go away

844
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,080
oh, God

845
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:34,320
you witch, what did you do?
you killed your own husband

846
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,640
i didn't do it

847
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,880
why should i believe you?

848
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,640
i saw it with own eyes

849
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,680
i didn't do anything
please believe me

850
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:48,200
hey listen....
she killed her husband

851
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,520
she killed her husband

852
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,480
because of your wrong story,
you killed Kaveri

853
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,280
She also murdered my three kids...

854
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:06,840
What about that?

855
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,880
She also killed the pregnant women..
What about that?

856
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,240
That's not true...
You are lying...

857
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,440
She didn't allow your
future generation to live...

858
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,640
She did not want you
to poison their young minds...

859
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,000
with your evil thoughts and traditions..

860
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,120
One more thing...

861
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,480
She did not kill the pregnant women,
you killed them...

862
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,400
Had I not understood Kaveri 's story
even I would have been killed

863
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,720
Kaveri

864
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,280
don't do this, Kaveri

865
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,960
I know no-one has understood
your pain and sacrifice...

866
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:00,840
but i have understood the truth..

867
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:04,120
I'll tell the world your true story...

868
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,360
Kaveri, don't kill my baby

869
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,640
don't kill my baby

870
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:18,840
If my baby gets killed,
then once again a mother will suffer inj

871
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:23,440
And only you can understand
a mother's pain...

872
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,440
please don't kill my baby

873
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:33,160
Help me save my baby...

874
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:40,480
Kaveri, I promise you that
the culprits will be brought to justice.

875
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,840
Please help me and my baby

876
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,280
please spare my baby

877
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,040
kaveri...

878
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:55,160
help me for the sake
of all mothers...

879
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,840
I am not afraid of you all..

880
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,640
you all are worse than animals...

881
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,840
keep your mouth shut

882
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,240
don't act smart

883
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,040
women should mind their limits

884
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,360
don't forget, a woman is also a mother

885
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,680
Listen...

886
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,040
Forget the past...

887
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,800
After these three days...

888
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:59,000
my house, my family is free
of the dark spell...

889
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,080
you stay here with us...

890
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,600
We'll all live happily together...

891
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,280
Let our legacy grow...

892
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,560
if you do not do as I say...

893
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:16,480
then I will...

894
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:20,120
will have to kill you

895
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,640
Killing is your only talent..

896
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,280
Laxmi survived because she
lacked courage to raise her voice...

897
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,840
but i will not remain silent

898
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
what happened?

899
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,920
You are not used to
a woman saying such things, right?

900
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,040
what wil you do now?

901
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:42,320
you will tell your son to kill me...

902
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,080
Am I right?

903
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,520
What say, Tushar?

904
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,680
Tushar!!!

905
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,280
Now you have crossed the line..

906
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,680
Dare you come closer !

907
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:12,160
I could have left from here
yesterday itself...

908
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,080
but I wanted to put an end
to what you had started..

909
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:21,480
And most importantly, Tushar
...Sorry, Pratap..

910
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:25,560
I wish you were man enough
to do what was right...

911
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,280
I will give birth to this baby...

912
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,040
and ensure that it's nothing like you...

913
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,160
hey girl...

914
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:06,960
you can't leave...

915
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,040
- Laxmi, what have you done?
