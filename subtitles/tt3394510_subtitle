1
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:59,083
'On 23rd October 2010 six friends..'

2
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:02,500
'..Siddharth,
Bhanu Jairaj, Harsh Lulla..'

3
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:07,875
'..Raja, Suhana and Priya went
to forest for trekking.'

4
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:13,417
'But unfortunately,
only Raja returned from there.'

5
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,333
'After nine days Siddharth's camera..'

6
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,042
'..was recovered from forest.'

7
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,958
'Mars Inc Production
team interviewed Raja..'

8
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,125
'..the sole person
to return from the forest.'

9
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,917
Excuse me.
Is the camera ready? - Yes, sir.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,042
Mr. Raja. - Yes.

11
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:34,958
Mr. Raja. - Yes, sir.

12
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:36,708
Are you ready? - Yes, sir.

13
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,333
Tell us something about
the friendship you guys shared.

14
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:45,375
Perhaps I won't be able to
tell you much about our friendship.

15
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:51,250
But as I talk, you will
come to know about our friendship.

16
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,958
BJ would say that in friendship
your friend is your God.

17
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,042
But you realize the
value of friendship..

18
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,833
..when you separate from your friend.

19
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,792
Mr. Raja, all of you were
childhood friends, right? - Yes.

20
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,042
You guys grew up in Srirangapatna.

21
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,750
We were from the same city.

22
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,417
But BJ was from Delhi.

23
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,042
His granny's house was near my house.

24
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,500
He would come here often.

25
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:23,667
Suhana was BJ's girlfriend.
So we knew Suhana too.

26
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,667
But we had never met Priya.

27
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:30,958
We met Priya for the first
time when we were going for trekking.

28
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,375
Okay. Whose idea was
it to go for trekking?

29
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,250
BJ and Sid had made this plan.

30
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,875
And..

31
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:44,208
BJ loved traveling.

32
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,667
He was crazy. Sid was also crazy.

33
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,125
But Sid was crazy about his work.

34
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:56,042
He wanted to be a famous DOP.

35
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,208
And he was working
with some DOP in Mumbai.

36
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:04,125
He quit his job where
he was getting Rs.50000.

37
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,583
When Sid found out that
we are going for trekking..

38
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,125
..he was delighted.

39
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:13,292
He wanted to make a
documentary film on trekking.

40
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,583
And..

41
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,458
And..and..

42
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:30,583
And these tapes were
shot from Sid's camera.

43
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,792
He..

44
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,917
Mr. Raja, are you alright?

45
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:46,083
Yes. Yes, sir.

46
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:49,167
Sir, can I get some water?

47
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,750
Please bring some water for him.

48
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,500
Drink water. - Thanks.

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,875
Are you alright?

50
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,333
Yes. I..I am fine.

51
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:09,958
Whenever I talk about the trek..

52
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:15,583
..I get unnerved.

53
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,708
We heard you had
to face many problems..

54
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,458
..after you returned from the trek.

55
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:21,458
Yes.

56
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:25,708
Many strange things were happening.

57
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,750
I couldn't understand anything.

58
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:32,292
Like my mobile shop ran into losses.

59
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,750
Papa also fell ill suddenly.

60
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:38,667
I couldn't understand
why this is happening.

61
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,792
All of a sudden? - Yes.

62
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,250
What did you do?

63
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,250
There is a learned
priest in our village.

64
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,542
I sought his advice.

65
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,417
He performed veneration in my house.

66
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,083
And he gave me this talisman.

67
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:57,042
After which my family's
condition improved a bit.

68
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,833
Whatever you told us today
and the tapes that we have..

69
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:06,583
..we want to release it
as a film under Mars Inc banner.

70
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,250
I hope you have no objection.

71
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:13,167
I don't have any objection.

72
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,542
You can show it.

73
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,000
I want people to see the truth.

74
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,458
Thank you very much, Mr. Raja.

75
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:23,375
Thanks. - Thank you.

76
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:29,917
Yes. Six people came here
and were staying in this guest house.

77
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,292
Girls were staying
in this room. - Okay.

78
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,250
And boys were staying in this room.

79
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,167
They ordered food at night.

80
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,208
They ate, drank and had fun.

81
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,875
Seeing their friendship I
felt they are very close friends.

82
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:47,167
But it was long ago.
Why do you want to know all this?

83
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,292
Actually,
there was a boy in that group. - Yes.

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,000
He had brought a camera along.

85
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,958
He shot everything that
happened in the forest. - Yes.

86
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:54,875
Yes. I remembered.

87
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,333
There was a boy in the group
who would always carry a camera.

88
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,292
We have his video tapes.

89
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,250
Our company is going to release..

90
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,542
..the video tapes
in theatres as a film.

91
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,333
Okay?

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,708
Goodbye. - Goodbye.

93
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:13,875
'An article was published on
30th October 2010 in some newspapers.'

94
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:21,750
'We thank late Mr. Siddharth's family
and all the forest authorities.'

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,125
'With their permission
the video tape..'

96
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:27,083
'..is being released
in theatres as a film.'

97
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,417
'This video has been
shot from Siddharth's camera.'

98
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:38,042
'It has been edited to present
the video aptly in theatres.'

99
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,458
Such lovely greenery!

100
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,875
Boss. - Yes.

101
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,917
Seems like the delivery
went to the wrong place.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,250
Whose? - Yours.

103
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,125
Don't you think you should
have been born in California..

104
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,125
..to suit your style?

105
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,167
Is that so?

106
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:07,292
Don't you think you should have
been born in Uganda to suit your face?

107
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:10,833
Seems like aunt's flight
had an emergency landing in India.

108
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,333
Both of you have again started.

109
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,750
Boss, tell me.
Which button to press for zoom?

110
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,458
There is a button in the center.

111
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,000
Press it. It's like a switch.

112
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,250
You have an amazing camera.

113
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,500
The picture quality is amazing.

114
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,542
Do you know?
It will come in handy for the trek.

115
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:28,417
It's an HD camera, bro.

116
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,333
Powerful battery backup.
Amazing solar recharge.

117
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,417
It's like a real film camera, man.

118
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,250
Your boss gave you
such an advanced camera?

119
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,125
Of course, dude.

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,417
My boss is an amazing guy.

121
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,458
When he found out that I am
going for trekking with my friends..

122
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:45,917
..he said, "Why still camera?"

123
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,417
"Take this HD camera."

124
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,958
"Make a 3-hour documentary."

125
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,458
If it's good,
then I will be the first..

126
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,292
..assistant cameraman
in the next film.

127
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:58,000
Boss. Boss.
Boss, you have hit a jackpot.

128
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,917
It will be great fun.
It will be great fun.

129
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,708
Do you know why I
chose south this time?

130
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:10,667
Perhaps you thought
that Yashraj shot Punjab.

131
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,875
Mr. Bhansali shot Gujarat.

132
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:16,667
Pandey chose UP.
And Mr. Devgan chose Bihar.

133
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,625
So we should at least see
Rajni's South once. Isn't it?

134
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,458
Incredible! What a dialogue!

135
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:24,417
Of course.

136
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,667
Boss, I hope the camera is not on.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,833
The camera is on.

138
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,667
Scoundrel! Morons!

139
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,292
Why are you covering it?

140
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,583
It's not that you
have something special..

141
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,125
..that we don't have.

142
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,167
All of us have it.

143
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:42,208
Does it mean I should
roam around naked?

144
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,375
Listen. Listen. Where has Raja gone?

145
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:47,042
He must be shitting
under some tree. - What?

146
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,958
He passes motion anywhere. - Yes.

147
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:52,292
He feels like shitting
whenever he sees water.

148
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,000
Raja.

149
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,292
Quiet. Quiet. - Raja.

150
00:08:58,417 --> 00:08:59,917
Come on. Let's shoot him naked.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,833
Yes. Come on.

152
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:01,667
Let's go.

153
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,375
Listen. - Yes.

154
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,917
Hide behind the tree. - Yes.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,250
Sit down. Sit down. - Hey!

156
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:10,000
Fatso, he will spot you first.

157
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,417
Now slowly. - Yes.

158
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,792
Don't make any noise. - Yes.

159
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,042
One, two, three.

160
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,708
Raja! - Raja!

161
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,750
Morons!

162
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,417
Morons! Scoundrel!

163
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,500
You don't even let me shit in peace!

164
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,000
Hey Englishman!

165
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,833
You have also started
speaking in English.

166
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,625
Not shit. Say potty. Got that? - Yes.

167
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,500
DOG! I will first teach
you a lesson once I come out.

168
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,667
Firstly, I am not
interested in your lesson.

169
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,792
Secondly, it's not DOG but DOP.

170
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,833
Director of photography. - Yes.

171
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,625
What you are doing is
pornography and not photography.

172
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,833
Wait. Take this.

173
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,792
Carefully. It's a camera.

174
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,750
Why are you laughing?

175
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,125
When did you come?
- I came just now from Mumbai.

176
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,083
This is the first sight I saw.

177
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,833
Listen. This will be
the first shot of my movie.

178
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,583
Moron! Your movie!

179
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,750
Meet me outside!

180
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay. Forget that.

181
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,125
Tell me about your marriage.
When are you getting married?

182
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,833
After three months.
But I won't invite you.

183
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,417
I won't even invite both of you.
- After three months.

184
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,958
By then my camera's
guarantee will be over, man.

185
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:18,625
To hell with your camera's guarantee.

186
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,958
Moron! - What are you doing?

187
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,750
DOG! Why are you making a movie?

188
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:26,083
I am not making a movie,
you silly man!

189
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,667
I am making a documentary
film for Cannes.

190
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,167
I have given a commitment to my boss.

191
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,292
If I give a commitment,
the work is as good as done.

192
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,917
You are making a
documentary film for Cannes.

193
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,458
Will it be an audio movie? No video?

194
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,750
Moron! Scoundrel!
Fatso! Don't speak nonsense!

195
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,625
Otherwise I will throw
a stone at your groin!

196
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,333
When you have a vulnerable groin..

197
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,083
..you shouldn't eye other's groin.

198
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,625
Shut up! - You are a scoundrel.

199
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,375
By the way, if he makes
a 3-hour movie on us.. - Yes.

200
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:55,625
All of us will be in a mess.
Let me warn you.

201
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,792
Why? - What is it that you have done?

202
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,292
He had come to Goa with us.
- Is that so?

203
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,500
You know what he did? - Yes.

204
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:03,833
He left everything and
followed us with his camera.

205
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,042
Laughing, crying, roaming around.

206
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,292
He didn't let us live in peace.

207
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,292
Moron! You spoilt that trip. - How?

208
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,375
Remember that performance
thing? - What?

209
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:16,167
He said, "Man, we have come to Goa.
Get me a girl."

210
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,542
I gave him condom.

211
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,542
He told, this is wrong flavour.

212
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,333
Look, we are meeting tomorrow at 7:30.

213
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,458
And we will leave
for trekking by 9:30.

214
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,625
Any confusion?
- No. No confusion at all.

215
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,000
So hear your duties.

216
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,167
Okay, BJ. - Yes.

217
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,250
Your duty is to get food. - Yes.

218
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:33,375
Okay, Raja, Lulla.

219
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,875
Your duty is to bring pillows,
blankets and mattresses. - Hey!

220
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:36,875
Melodramatic! - What?

221
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,292
I have packed solar batteries
to charge the camera.

222
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,458
Technical is my department.
Okay? - Shall we go?

223
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:42,583
It's his usual drama. - Fine. Come on.

224
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,083
Come on, boss. Sit behind. - Come on.

225
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes. Everything is done?

226
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,083
Bro, I think we will have
to buy some stuff from Mysore too.

227
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,667
How far is the forest from Mysore?

228
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,292
Fatso, it will take us 3 to
3 hours to reach there. - Yes. Fine.

229
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,125
Lulla, check whether
all your things are there.

230
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,542
It's enough for me.
You guys arrange for yourself.

231
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,417
Moron, it's for everyone.

232
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,083
Raja. - Yes.

233
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:07,792
Where is your bride from? - Rampur.

234
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,667
Where is Rampur? - It's nearby.

235
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,750
Here. Come on.
Suhana and Priya are also here.

236
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,292
Hi.

237
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,250
Hey, baby.

238
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,375
Hi, Priya. - Hi.

239
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,500
When he sees girls,
why does he leave everything..

240
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,458
..and runs to them?

241
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,083
I think it's the side effect of love.

242
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,333
Suhana must be BJ's girlfriend.

243
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,583
No. She is Priya. Suhana's friend.

244
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,375
Childhood friend.

245
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,375
Same school,
same college, same job, same PG.

246
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,417
Same boy.

247
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,417
Lulla is very lonely. At least
introduce me to the other girl.

248
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,208
Priya, meet my friends.

249
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,375
Hi. - Hi. Hi.

250
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,917
Guys. - Hi, Sid.

251
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,167
Priya. Priya.
- She is Priya, my friend.

252
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,292
Hi, Priya.

253
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,083
Raja, come on!

254
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,167
Ma'am, are you coming?
- Yes. Of course.

255
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,500
Do one thing, Lulla. You click it.

256
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,458
Give me. I click nice pictures.

257
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,208
Give it to Lulla.
Let's see how he clicks.

258
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,792
Click nice pictures, Lulla. Or
else next time I won't give it to you.

259
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,042
You again came in between?
- In between?

260
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:11,750
Move aside.

261
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,083
He is her boyfriend. - What do I do?

262
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,542
Raja, look. See this.

263
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,167
Show me. Show me. Show me.

264
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:26,042
You click such pathetic pictures.
- What happened?

265
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,750
Boss, he has clicked pictures.
- It's not good?

266
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,625
Show me.

267
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,542
Do one thing, Sid. You only click it.

268
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,667
He has clicked pathetic pictures.

269
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,500
Stop it, man.

270
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,417
Okay. Look.
- Let's take a group picture.

271
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes. - Come on.

272
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:37,917
Look. I am clicking
everybody's picture.

273
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,333
Did you pack everything?
- Yes. I have packed everything.

274
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,125
Where did you keep it?

275
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:46,500
Raja! Raja! Raja! - Yes.

276
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,167
Your father Mr. Shukla is coming.

277
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,375
Oh no! Look,
everybody look down and walk. - Yes.

278
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,875
Nobody will talk to him.

279
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,458
As soon as he comes near. - Yes.

280
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,667
Everybody will let him pass. - Okay.

281
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,958
Alright? Everybody walk by the side.
- Alright.

282
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,000
Sid, you too.
- He is so afraid of his father.

283
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,708
Don't say a word. - Don't worry.

284
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,333
That's how I run my household.

285
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,583
Uncle.

286
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,792
How are you?
Hello. - I will call you later.

287
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,667
Yes. Bless you. Bless you.

288
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,958
Hello, uncle. - Hello, uncle.

289
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:14,167
Just now Raja was praising you.

290
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,542
Is that so? - Yes.

291
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,625
Forget him. Tell me.
At what time are you guys leaving?

292
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,917
Around 11 o'clock.

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,375
11 o'clock. - Yes. 11 o'clock.

294
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,333
Son, do me a favor. - Yes, uncle.

295
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,167
Tell us. We will do it.

296
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,542
Do you see this? - Yes.

297
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,167
Moron. Useless fellow.
Good-for-nothing.

298
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:34,042
Leave him somewhere in the forest.
I will be indebted to you.

299
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,292
Uncle, why do you say that?

300
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,375
Raja is a good boy.

301
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,542
Is that so? - Yes.

302
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,083
He is a good boy? - Yes.

303
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:44,792
I have spent half my
life finding a bride for him.

304
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,708
But he doesn't like anyone.

305
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,958
The amount of time I have
spent finding a bride for him..

306
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,667
..if I had spent
that time in a temple..

307
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,708
..God would have appeared before me.

308
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:56,292
And blessed me. Look at him. Yes.

309
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you know how many
girls I saw for him?

310
00:14:59,083 --> 00:14:59,833
How many? - How many, uncle?

311
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,792
Oh no! In front of everyone.

312
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:03,958
Around 5-6.

313
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:04,625
That's it? - Yes.

314
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,875
Why are you counting on your fingers?

315
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,958
45 girls. 45. - 45.

316
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,042
45. - This idiot rejected all of them.

317
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,667
Why, Raja? Why did you reject them?

318
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,708
What must have happened?

319
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,417
What is this, Raja?

320
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,083
Tell us.
- Why, Raja? Why did you do that?

321
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,083
What do I do if I don't
see my mother in anyone?

322
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:21,750
Look at this.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,958
Idiot! Do you want a mother or a wife?

324
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,542
I want a mother. - He wants a mother.

325
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,042
Unlucky is that girl
who will marry him.

326
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,417
He won't do anything. - Yes.

327
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,542
Son, you guys are getting late. - Yes.

328
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,167
You guys go. - Yes.

329
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,750
Go carefully.
Take care of yourself. - Yes.

330
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,708
And tell this fool to take
care of himself in the forest. - Yes.

331
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,000
Go carefully. - Okay.

332
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,042
Bye, uncle. - Bye, uncle.

333
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:42,667
Take care. Bye.

334
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,083
I won't spare this idiot!

335
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,250
Stop, fatso! Stop! Stop!

336
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:46,958
Where are you going?

337
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,333
How far will you run? Stop! - Sid.

338
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,667
I told you so many times.
Don't do mischief with my father.

339
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,625
Why? Why?

340
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:03,958
The camera is on, isn't it?

341
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,875
She is good.

342
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,083
Lulla.

343
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,000
Lulla. Lulla.

344
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,292
Lulla.

345
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,125
Lulla.

346
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,708
See what Raja is doing.

347
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:30,833
He is removing his socks.

348
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:32,792
Yuck!

349
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:33,375
Socks.

350
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,792
Oh my god.

351
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,875
I am selling my socks. Do you want it?

352
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,000
Run! Run! Run! - Moron!

353
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,958
Lulla, stop. - Come on! Come on!

354
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,083
Really nice, actually. - It's nice.

355
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,417
It's nice. - Do one thing.

356
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,750
It's a nice place. - Open the door.

357
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,375
It's locked.

358
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,500
Hi. My name is Harsh Lulla.

359
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,792
You will see that six of
us have come for trekking. - Quiet.

360
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,500
Infuse some zest and sensation.

361
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,708
If you want to sleep peacefully,
wake up.

362
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:25,042
I am pleased to tell you that
six of us have come for trekking.

363
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,333
There are two beautiful girls too.

364
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,167
Look. Camera, focus.

365
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:32,792
I don't understand. - Come on.

366
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,625
Let's hear their story.

367
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:36,792
Come on.

368
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,708
He has come. He is approaching me.

369
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,583
He is approaching me. - Relax. Relax.

370
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,750
Hello, Priya. How do you feel?

371
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:48,958
It's great fun.
All of you are very interesting.

372
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,667
And I think I am going
to enjoy this trip a lot.

373
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,125
Have you ever gone
for trekking before?

374
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,667
Yes. I have. During my college days.

375
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,500
This is my second trip.

376
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,417
And yeah. I hope I have fun.

377
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,833
I want to thank my friend Suhana.
- Please. Come on.

378
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,542
For bringing me for this trek.

379
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,000
Breaking news.

380
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:12,667
The in-charge of the guest
house has brought the keys.

381
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,792
Sir, every evening
a man goes to the city.

382
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,000
If you want anything, you can tell me.

383
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,083
As such, we have everything.

384
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:23,958
But if we need anything,
we will tell you.

385
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,250
Please order something. I am hungry.

386
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,750
Will you have momos? - Okay.

387
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,042
Send two plates momos.

388
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:30,917
Anything else?

389
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,542
Bring two plates momos for me too.
- Okay, sir.

390
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,292
Yes! Raja!

391
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,292
Come on! Come on! - Wait! Wait!

392
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,583
It's Raja's turn. Let's do one thing.

393
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,500
Tell us. Truth or dare.

394
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,458
Come on. - Man, I am not a brave guy.

395
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,000
So I will speak the truth. Okay?

396
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:05,042
Tell me something, Raja.
Are you a virgin?

397
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,875
What a question!

398
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,167
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

399
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,417
Man, if I say it on the camera,
my marriage will be called off.

400
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,708
Turn the camera there.
- Nothing will happen.

401
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:18,875
Okay. - Tell us. Are you a virgin?

402
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,458
Tell us. - No.

403
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,917
Amazing! - Stop it, man!

404
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,750
When did that happen?
Tell me. - Yes, man.

405
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,833
A year ago. Chikuwadi's Sandhya.

406
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,833
Come on. Next. Next.

407
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,417
You didn't tell me, did you?

408
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,042
Shut up.

409
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,542
Lulla!

410
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,625
Lulla! - It's his turn.

411
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,250
Lulla! Lulla!
Lulla! - Now watch. Now watch.

412
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,250
Yes! - Raja.

413
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,167
Lulla! - His turn is over.

414
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,875
Truth! Truth!
- Truth or dare! Got that?

415
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,167
Or dare!

416
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,042
Raja has inspired me. - Yes.

417
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,375
Do one thing. Dare. - Wow!

418
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,667
That's like a man!

419
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,208
Do one thing. - You say it.

420
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,667
Propose Priya.

421
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,458
My poor sister-in-law.

422
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,208
I am fatso.

423
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:06,708
And I want to have
small babies with you.

424
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,083
Hey! - Hey you!

425
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,333
Priya, I love you.

426
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,375
I love you.

427
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,583
Wait. Wait. Wait.

428
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,125
Everybody has spun it.
Now let me do it. - Yes.

429
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,125
Here. Spin it.

430
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,708
Here. - What is this? Cheater.

431
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:24,583
What is this?

432
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,583
This is cheating. No. No. No.

433
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:26,875
I have a point. - Very nice.

434
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,250
I have a point.

435
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,542
Okay. Okay.
Sister-in-law. - He is right.

436
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,208
Sister-in-law, truth or dare?
- Of course. Dare.

437
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,500
She is my friend.
I will give her the dare.

438
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,375
Easy one. Easy one.

439
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,250
Suhana, you will kiss BJ.

440
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:45,000
BJ, you are a lucky chap.
- Do it. Do it.

441
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:48,917
Kiss him. Do it. Do it.

442
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,250
Keep quiet.

443
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,458
What happened?
- Who switched off the light?

444
00:20:57,542 --> 00:20:58,833
The light went off at the right time.

445
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,667
Raja, light a matchstick.
- Matchstick..

446
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,250
I gave it to you.
- Moron, I can't see in the dark.

447
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:08,250
But why are BJ and Suhana so quiet?

448
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,125
Look, what had to happen,
has happened.

449
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,375
Now switch on the lights.

450
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,583
Suhana, are you okay?

451
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,667
Suhana, you should be fine.

452
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,625
It's okay if we die.

453
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,708
Yes. I am sorry. Are you okay?

454
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,125
Boss, where is the camera light?
- I had removed it.

455
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,500
Wait. Let me bring it.

456
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,417
Yeah!

457
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,833
Thank you so much.

458
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,083
What is going on there?

459
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,625
The in-charge is coming.
Come on. Fast.

460
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,667
Come on. Come on. Fast.

461
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,500
Come on, fatso.

462
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:51,917
BJ.

463
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,125
I am going out to take
some early morning shots.

464
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,167
And I have to charge the
camera's solar batteries too.

465
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:57,667
By the time I come back
all of you should be ready.

466
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,667
Okay? - Yes.

467
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,083
BJ, I got such wonderful shots.
It was amazing.

468
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:23,458
Honestly. If I shoot like that,
I will gain experience.

469
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,042
And operating the camera
will become very easy.

470
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:27,583
Carry on, boss.
We also want you to be a famous DOP.

471
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,667
Cold water.
Cold water. - Raja, you have come.

472
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,250
Water. - Lulla, wake up.

473
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:35,125
Lulla.

474
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,375
Hey! - What?

475
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:37,458
Come on. Come on.

476
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:39,000
What are you doing?

477
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,375
What are you doing? Tell us. - Quiet.

478
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,917
Oh man!

479
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,583
Lulla.

480
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:55,875
Lulla, wake up.

481
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,167
Lulla, wake up.

482
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:58,708
Lulla, wake up.

483
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,792
Has everybody taken a bath?
I will wake up.

484
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,208
Yes. Everybody has taken a bath.
The girls are already ready.

485
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:05,333
If you don't wake up,
you will be punished.

486
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,250
Get up.

487
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,375
Lulla, wake up.

488
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,708
It's getting late.

489
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,625
Where is God's photo?
- Lulla, look straight ahead.

490
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,292
God is ahead.

491
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,208
Glory to Lord! Let me behold you!

492
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,958
Hey! - Lulla, did you behold God?

493
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:45,375
Lulla. Lulla.

494
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,083
Lulla, did you worship properly?

495
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:47,875
Lulla.

496
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,083
What did Lulla see?

497
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,292
Moron. When I was sleeping yesterday..

498
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,208
..you made me smell your dirty socks.

499
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,250
Lulla, what did you see?

500
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,125
I don't want to come
after seeing his bum.

501
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,500
It's not easy to climb the mountain.

502
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,875
It's a kind of test.

503
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:06,625
Of your patience and strength.

504
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,917
Remember one thing.

505
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,833
Wherever you find water, fill it.

506
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,292
Otherwise you will face a problem.

507
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,917
Fatso, pay attention.

508
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:16,625
Yes.

509
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,417
Don't light a fire in the mountain.
Remember that.

510
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,542
Go safely and come back safely.

511
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,042
My man will leave you at
the starting point of the forest.

512
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:27,708
Thank you, sir.

513
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,250
God bless you. - Thank you, sir.

514
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,042
Come on. - Okay.

515
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,750
Bye, sir. - Bye, sir.

516
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:38,750
Come sir. - Bye.

517
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:39,833
Take care.

518
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:42,417
Anand, drop them. - Okay. Come on.

519
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:46,583
Wow! I am seeing it for
the first time. - Yes, sir.

520
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:47,500
It's very interesting.

521
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,417
Shall we wait for them? Or move on?

522
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,958
Before they come, I have to
shoot all the beautiful scenarios.

523
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,708
Come on. Let's go. - Okay, sir.

524
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,458
Anand. - Yes.

525
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,667
Such an old method is still
being used in the village.

526
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,333
I mean, didn't the government
build a bridge to go across?

527
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,375
Yes, sir. Many times people do..

528
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,292
..what the government also can't do.

529
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,000
What do you mean?

530
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,208
I mean, a few years ago
a boy from this village..

531
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:13,125
..fell in love with a girl
from the village across the river.

532
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,792
Oh! - The boy would swim
everyday to meet the girl.

533
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:20,875
Great! - One day the girl
accepted his marriage proposal.

534
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,458
Their families also agreed.

535
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
But the problem was how the
wedding procession will travel.

536
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:29,042
So the boy made this plank. - Amazing!

537
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,417
The wedding procession and the bride..

538
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,792
..crossed the river using this plank.

539
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,333
Since then both the villages
share a very cordial relation.

540
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:37,375
Amazing! Amazing! That's a true lover.

541
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,667
Anand, they are here.
Bring them. - Okay, sir.

542
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,167
Yeah!

543
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:46,583
Man, give me your hand.

544
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,458
What, boss? You came alone.

545
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:49,958
You should have waited for us.

546
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:51,500
Sorry. I couldn't wait.

547
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:54,125
Did you get your shots? - Superb.

548
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,833
Your first movie is a hit, boss.

549
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,417
Yes! BJ, thanks, man.

550
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,333
Hi. - Hi, Suhana.

551
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:02,292
Hi, Priya.

552
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,625
Come, fatso. - Raja, Lulla, come on.

553
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,500
Give me your hand.

554
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:05,125
Come on.

555
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,958
There is no network in the forest.

556
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:07,917
Come on.

557
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,167
Wait.

558
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:13,833
Guys!

559
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:16,083
Do you know what
professional trekkers..

560
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:16,875
..who go to Himalayas do?

561
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,000
As if you know everything.

562
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,750
How many times have
you climbed the Himalayas?

563
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,625
I haven't climbed it. But I know.

564
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:26,458
They hoist a flag to mark
the spot where they had been.

565
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,625
Okay. - That is what I will also do.

566
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:29,250
I understood that.

567
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,292
But what are the fireworks for?

568
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,167
Fireworks are for celebration.

569
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,625
Flag is for indication.

570
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,042
What is going on? - Who is that?

571
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,750
He must have been
a dog in his past life.

572
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:40,875
Good job.

573
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:48,542
BJ! You moron! I won't spare you!

574
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,167
Soldiers! See that highest point!

575
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,667
Talk properly. Soldiers!

576
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,958
Very impressive. Moron.

577
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,917
Do you see that highest point? - Okay.

578
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,500
We have to reach there
by tomorrow morning.

579
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,708
That's our main mission.

580
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:03,500
And we have to hoist the
flag on that peak. Is that clear?

581
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:04,375
Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

582
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,417
Is it clear, Sid?
- Yes. This is our mission.

583
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,167
Raja. - Yes.

584
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,917
You too. - Give me the phone.

585
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,542
Why do you need the phone?

586
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:14,250
To tell them to dig graves for us.

587
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,875
Why do you need graves? - Oh God!

588
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:19,958
Once we come back from there,
we will lie down as dead bodies.

589
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,208
Moron! Say good things.

590
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,792
What is this?
- He is talking about dead bodies.

591
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,500
What say good things?

592
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,792
Where is that peak?
And where are we standing?

593
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,250
We have to go so
far and come back too.

594
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,042
I am in a bad shape.
- I am also in a bad shape.

595
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,292
But did I complain?

596
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,583
BJ. - Yes.

597
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:37,500
Let's do one thing.

598
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,500
The beach isn't that far from here.

599
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,542
Let's go there and chill. - Oh God!

600
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,958
Come on. - Come on. It's done for.

601
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,042
Come on. - Come on, Priya.

602
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,250
Listen to me.

603
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,458
Sissy boy.

604
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:48,917
You are such a coward.

605
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,708
Imagine what Priya and
Suhana will think about you.

606
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:55,167
This man doesn't have any guts,
no nerves. He is useless.

607
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,750
Why are you intimidating me?
Move on. - Meet me.

608
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:01,750
Yes. I will meet you.
Come on. - Meet me. I will show you.

609
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,333
What happened, Lulla? - I felt bad.

610
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,833
Why? - How dare he call me sissy?

611
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:13,125
He is a sissy.
Priya, is the camera on? - Yes.

612
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,625
Priya, is the camera on?
- Lulla, it's on.

613
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:17,667
Now watch.
- Lulla, what are you doing?

614
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,583
Watch where I throw Sid's flag.

615
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,458
Lulla, don't throw it.
- Glory to Lord!

616
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,667
Bye. Bye.

617
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,292
Lulla, what have you done?

618
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:27,583
Whenever he sees this spot,
he will burn with fury.

619
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,792
"I am smoldering."

620
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:30,833
"In this forest."

621
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,750
Lulla. - He is finished!

622
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,958
Forget it, Sid.
You won't find that flag.

623
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,500
No, Priya. I want that flag.

624
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,417
Lulla threw it deep inside.

625
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,875
How deep he must have thrown it?

626
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,958
It must be stuck in trees.

627
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:46,792
Okay. - Look.

628
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,583
Did he throw it there? - Yes, look.

629
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:49,708
Look there.

630
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,417
No. It isn't there.

631
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,500
I can't see it, Priya.

632
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:58,250
I can't see it anywhere.

633
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:04,917
I explained to him.
I don't think you will find it.

634
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:10,250
Wow! - Wow!

635
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,375
What a place!

636
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,750
Boss. Come here please. - Look, Sid.

637
00:29:13,958 --> 00:29:15,500
What a place! - Superb!

638
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,167
I haven't seen such an amazing place!

639
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,958
This is an amazing mountain, Lulla.
- I can see.

640
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,917
This is rocking.

641
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,458
Beautiful! - Wow!

642
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:23,833
Honeybee. Honeybee.

643
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,292
Listen! - What? What?

644
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,583
I can hear an echo.

645
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,750
Siddharth.

646
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:28,833
Siddharth.

647
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,167
Raja!

648
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,125
Raja!

649
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,583
Suhana.

650
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:33,625
Suhana.

651
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,708
Priya.

652
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,292
Bhanu Jairaj!

653
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,208
Bhanu Jairaj!

654
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:38,708
Everybody scream Lulla's name.

655
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,000
Lulla!

656
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:40,917
Lulla!

657
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,625
Fatso, now be happy.

658
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,125
Wow! - Wow!

659
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,583
How interesting!

660
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,625
Great!

661
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,333
What a cave, man!

662
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,208
I have never seen anything
like this before. - Seriously, man!

663
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,750
It's amazing!

664
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:53,833
Beautiful!

665
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,708
It's so deep. - It's nice.

666
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:57,917
Wow! - Look up.

667
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,208
What a place!

668
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,125
Oh my God! - Amazing!

669
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,208
Wow!

670
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:05,583
Boss, I will recite
a verse on our friendship.

671
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,667
Go on. - Go on. Go on.

672
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,667
Go on.

673
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,333
In friendship your friend is your God.

674
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:12,375
Wow!

675
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:16,875
In friendship your friend is your God.
- Amazing!

676
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,458
But you realize the
value of friendship..

677
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,250
..when you separate from your friend.

678
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,542
Wow! Amazing! - Great!

679
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,375
Thank you.
- Today he has touched my heart.

680
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:40,083
A last salute for the mountain.

681
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:43,000
One. Two.

682
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:43,917
You also bend.

683
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,375
Three.

684
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:46,792
One for Lulla.

685
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,250
Four.

686
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,625
Fatso, be happy. Come on.

687
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,250
Sid! Come on!

688
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,833
Boss. Where are you, boss? - Coming.

689
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,208
What is this? Where were you?

690
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:14,917
Sorry. I was taking some
beautiful and interesting shots.

691
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:17,083
Don't you think you
can take beautiful..

692
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,750
..and interesting shots from the peak?

693
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,250
Okay. - I was sleeping peacefully.

694
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,208
Why did you come so soon? - Come on.

695
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:27,167
Man, in his past life
DOG must have died in a shoot.

696
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,292
Shut up. Come on. It's enough.

697
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,875
Get up. Come on.

698
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:34,292
Lulla. - What, Mr. DOG?

699
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:37,417
I think the forest department's
check post is nearby. - Yes.

700
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,500
There is liquor in your bag. - Yes.

701
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:41,500
Hide it in the girls' bag.
- Is that so?

702
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:42,917
They won't check it. - Yes.

703
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,625
If the liquor is found,
the guards won't let you go.

704
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,667
And they will keep the liquor too.
- Oh God! Seriously?

705
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:48,667
Yes.

706
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,167
Be serious, guys.

707
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,208
We have to enter our
information in the registry.

708
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,458
Does anyone have any address proof?

709
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,792
Yes. I have my driving license.
- Come on. Fine.

710
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:04,208
'This is the photocopy of
the forest department's register..'

711
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:07,042
'..where they had
entered their details.'

712
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,458
Yes. This is the starting
point of our trek.

713
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,000
Guys, get ready. Let's go. - Yes.

714
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:21,750
When I had gone to Kodaikanal..

715
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,625
..I had camped at the peak.

716
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,458
We will also camp at the peak.

717
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,333
But speed up.

718
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:31,750
Are we going to get a medal
if we reach the peak quickly?

719
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,583
Raja and Lulla are finished.

720
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,083
No smoking. No drinking.

721
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,667
Raja. - Yes.

722
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,958
Shall I suggest something?
- Yes. Tell me.

723
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,625
You are getting married
after three months, aren't you?

724
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,750
Yes. So?

725
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,500
Do one thing.
Tell Sid to shoot your wedding video.

726
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,000
Yes. Cool.

727
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,458
He will shoot the wedding later.

728
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:50,667
First he will shoot our nuptial night.

729
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,583
I know this cheap fellow.

730
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:52,958
What are you saying? - Laugh.

731
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:54,917
You are going to have
a nuptial night too?

732
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,375
Why am I marrying?

733
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:00,625
Oh my! - Look,
if Raja does something interesting..

734
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,917
Yes. - Our blue film
will be made for free.

735
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:06,250
We will upload it
on the net and call it..

736
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,458
..shedding clothes
under a hot blanket.

737
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,875
It will be an online
tutor for virgins.

738
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:18,167
And the new king of
the world of blue films..

739
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,625
..will be Mr.
Shukla's son Lover Boy Shukla.

740
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,250
Shut up! You scoundrel!

741
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:27,292
You will make a Hollywood movie?

742
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,667
You scoundrel! - Leave me.

743
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,833
All of you are cheap.

744
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,667
You are making me
the hero of blue films.

745
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,458
Are you going to get a hot heroine?

746
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,125
You want something more? - Moron!

747
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,042
Fatso! At least I got a wife! Moron!

748
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,083
Raja, don't worry. I will
shoot a nice video of your marriage.

749
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:44,125
Yes. You make nice videos. I know.

750
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,958
I don't trust you at all.

751
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,958
Look, listen to me carefully.

752
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:02,417
This forest is a big maze.

753
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,667
If we take the wrong path,
we will keep..

754
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,917
..wandering here all our lives.

755
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,250
So until we don't
come down from the peak..

756
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,500
..everybody will stick together.

757
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:11,375
Alright?

758
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,708
First tell this DOG.

759
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,833
He barges anywhere with his camera.

760
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,792
Hey!

761
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,542
Why is it so quiet?

762
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:43,958
Lulla. Raja.

763
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:45,708
Why don't you guys speak?

764
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,708
You fool! We are dead tired.

765
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,792
And you are talking about silence.

766
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:57,042
Look, we discussed the first break.
Let's have it here.

767
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:58,833
I can't walk anymore.

768
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,208
Come on. We will take it
further ahead. Come on. - No.

769
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:02,833
Come on. - What further ahead?

770
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,917
I can't walk. My back is paining.

771
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,625
Look, I am also in a very bad shape.

772
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:11,583
I can't walk.

773
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,500
Seriously. Lulla is right about you.

774
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,333
You are a weakling.

775
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,125
You don't have any other bad habit.

776
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:21,667
Except smoking.

777
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:22,833
I know.

778
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,417
But I swear on God.

779
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,917
From today, right now, I quit smoking.

780
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:35,083
Eating like a glutton.
- I am also hungry.

781
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:41,375
I also want to smoke. Let's share it.

782
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,625
Light another one.
I won't give you mine.

783
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,625
Scoundrel.

784
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,958
You swore on God.
And yet you are smoking.

785
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:50,458
May God make you a weakling!

786
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,292
You know the side effects of smoking,
don't you?

787
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:57,458
You will fail on your nuptial night.

788
00:35:57,917 --> 00:36:01,167
Even an overdose of
Viagra won't be of any help.

789
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,333
Got that, sonny?

790
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,583
What's the time? - It's 2:30.

791
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:06,958
Look, it is 2:30.

792
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:08,917
We had to reach there by 1:30.

793
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,042
If we walk so slowly, we won't
be able to reach the peak today.

794
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,875
That's why I say don't halt for rest.

795
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:14,792
Keep walking. Keep walking.

796
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:17,125
Guys, let us take rest for 10 minutes.

797
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,750
You are saying 10 minutes.
But it will last for 30 minutes.

798
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:23,208
No, Suhana. We can't waste
time at all. Let's move on.

799
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:27,042
Right, BJ. Just a while longer.
Then lunch break. Okay?

800
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:29,750
Move! Move! Move!

801
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:30,750
What happened?
-What's the matter, Sid?

802
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:31,750
Move!

803
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:33,375
I can hear the sound of waterfall.
- What happened?

804
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,583
Where are you running?

805
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,417
Oh God! Look at that!

806
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
It's a waterfall!

807
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:40,250
"Water."

808
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,042
Nice. - It's so beautiful.

809
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,333
Really nice.

810
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:46,250
Nice.

811
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:47,792
Wow!

812
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,875
What are you doing Lulla?

813
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:18,000
Come on let's go. - Yeah let's go.

814
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:28,542
I warn him three times,
but he didn't listen.

815
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,333
Raja. - Yes.

816
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:42,542
My appetite is so full.

817
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:45,833
I wish I could spread a
mat somewhere and go to sleep.

818
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,542
I swear. I will sleep soundly.

819
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:52,375
You are bound to feel
sleepy if you eat like a pig.

820
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,000
Fatso.

821
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:56,542
Boss, are we on the right path?
- Where have we come?

822
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,542
Yes.

823
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,750
Did you check the compass?
- I checked it just now. Don't worry.

824
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:02,083
Come on. Let's go.

825
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
Listen, fill your water bottles.
There is water here.

826
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:11,708
Come on. We have found water.

827
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Friends, fill your water
bottles quickly. - Yes.

828
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,000
Wonder whether we will
find water ahead. - Yes.

829
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,750
We will have to manage
everything with this water.

830
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,042
Washing, cooking and drinking.
Everything.

831
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:22,000
Why? Won't we find water ahead?

832
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,875
The resort's manager had said
to fill water wherever you find it.

833
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:26,333
Sid, come on. Come on.

834
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,000
Priya, give me your bottle.

835
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,542
Guys, if you have filled water,
let's move.

836
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,917
Come on, guys.

837
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,542
Hey! - Shut up.

838
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:37,583
Come on.

839
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,458
This is the great
adventure of our life.

840
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,333
I am exhausted.

841
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,458
I am in a bad shape.

842
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:47,375
I can't walk.

843
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,292
You guys are very boring.

844
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:52,375
Motivating you guys
is like demotivating myself.

845
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,083
Come on.

846
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,417
I am tired.

847
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,750
Boss. Boss, let's chuck it.

848
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:06,125
Let's camp here.

849
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:14,250
We have to gather woods..cook dinner.

850
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,833
If we need water,
there is water nearby.

851
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,958
Let's camp here, boss.
Let's camp here.

852
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,750
God! This is the best thing
I heard in the entire trip.

853
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,292
Seriously. - Come, BJ.

854
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,917
Let's find a good place to camp.

855
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,625
Come on. I am also coming.

856
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:34,500
BJ, Raja and Lulla have
ruined the entire trek.

857
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,625
What did I do?

858
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:39,042
Both the girls are still
trekking without complaining.

859
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,958
Yes. So? - They didn't
utter a single word.

860
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,875
Both of them are going
on talking nonsense.

861
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,792
Wonder where they waste their energy.
- Shut up.

862
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,000
Boss, is this place fine?

863
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,958
We will cook here
and light the fire there.

864
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,458
Is this okay? - Yes. It's fine.

865
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:52,625
Let's bring everybody.

866
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:53,708
No. You guys go. I will stay here.

867
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,250
Okay, boss. We will bring everyone.

868
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,042
Stay here. Don't go anywhere. - Okay.

869
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,250
Raja. - Yes.

870
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:03,667
I think we are the first people
in history who are camping here.

871
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,792
What do you say? - Yes. You are right.

872
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:09,375
I am famished.
We will cook a nice dinner today.

873
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:14,417
What is this?

874
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,375
A skull.

875
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:26,292
Human skulls all over the tree.

876
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,333
Oh God!

877
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,917
There is not a single leaf.

878
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,708
Voodoo dolls.

879
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:44,792
Oh God!

880
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,000
What is this, man?

881
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,375
Raja, where did you keep it?

882
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,708
Suhana, give me that. - Ok. Take it.

883
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:08,083
Where were you Sid?

884
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:10,833
The forest is so beautiful.
Like a shooting.

885
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:13,292
See what I have got. - What?

886
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:15,167
Why did you keep
this human skull here?

887
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,833
Where is the torch? - In the bag.

888
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:18,875
Check. - You should have thrown it.

889
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,250
No. I want it. I want it.

890
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,833
What? You want this human skull?

891
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:24,708
Why? - Yes.

892
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,750
Come on. - We don't have a flag.

893
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:28,000
We will use this.

894
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,083
When we reach the mountain tomorrow..

895
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,583
..we will use this
instead of the flag.

896
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,500
What an idea!

897
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:34,708
You will go to the peak
and keep this skull over there.

898
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:35,917
Are you mad?

899
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:38,792
No. No. No.
I am not mad. Understand one thing.

900
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:40,083
It's a much better thing.

901
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,208
I don't understand.
- Look, I don't have a flag.

902
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,750
This is more mysterious,
more dangerous.

903
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,458
Actually, think. When we
will reach the mountain tomorrow..

904
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:52,750
..and keep it there, it will signify
that this is a dangerous mountain.

905
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:53,875
People will also say. - Come. Sit.

906
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:54,958
I think it's fantastic.

907
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:56,542
Please don't touch it. - Anyway.

908
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:57,708
Your wish.

909
00:41:58,208 --> 00:42:00,500
Come on. Come on, Raja. - Keep quiet.

910
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,625
Just a little further.

911
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,792
Don't laugh. You will rot.

912
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,042
Understand one thing.
No stone, no food.

913
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,625
Just a little further.
The campsite is nearby.

914
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,250
Shut up.

915
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:13,167
Your papa will be happy.
Your would-be wife will be happy.

916
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,625
Come on. Come on.

917
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:16,917
Why did you leave it? What happened?

918
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:21,958
Are you a human or a brute?

919
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:26,750
Already my lungs have
got choked up due to smoking.

920
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:29,625
You don't help me.

921
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,708
And you keep saying, "Come on.
Come on."

922
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:35,625
Keep the camera down. Lift the stone.

923
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:40,958
Come on. Pick it up.

924
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:41,708
Come on.

925
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:45,500
I have told you countless
times not to smoke so much.

926
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,083
This is what the Indian
government tells you..

927
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,167
..at the beginning of every movie.

928
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:49,667
You don't understand.

929
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,208
Come on. Come on.

930
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,417
It's just a little away.

931
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,208
Come on. - From now on I
will heed the Indian government.

932
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:00,083
I swear on you. I won't smoke.

933
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,292
Sid.

934
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,500
If we had camped at the peak..

935
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,583
..we would have had
to come down for water.

936
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,500
It means we halted accidently
but at the right place. - Yes.

937
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:04,000
Okay. I have heard
you are doing a new movie.

938
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:05,458
Yes. I am doing a Hindi movie.

939
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:07,542
The shooting will begin
from the 20th of the next month.

940
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:09,458
Who is the hero?

941
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,250
The producer's son is again the hero.

942
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,208
I see.

943
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,333
I wanted to say something to you.

944
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,667
Man..

945
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,083
Man..I want to be an actor.

946
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:26,625
You are telling me now?
The auditions are over.

947
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:30,917
I don't want to be a hero.
I don't mind if it's a small role.

948
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:34,292
I only want to see myself
on the silver screen once.

949
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:37,208
That's it.
- I can do that. Don't worry.

950
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:39,458
Sure? - It's a promise. Promise.

951
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,875
Let's go. - Okay.

952
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,458
Sid. Sid.

953
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,583
Why did you turn back suddenly?

954
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:57,750
No. Nothing.
I felt as if somebody is behind me.

955
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,708
Was there anything?
- I don't know. I can't see anything.

956
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:03,083
Did you see anything?
- I felt there is something.

957
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:04,458
Don't play a prank. Come on.

958
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:08,500
I don't know.

959
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:10,792
There was something.

960
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:18,917
Sid..I was thinking that
you should quit Bollywood.

961
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,417
Look, so many marriages
take place in my village.

962
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,958
Open a studio in my village.
You will earn a lot of money.

963
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:25,708
Are you crazy?

964
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,750
Marriage studio? In a village? - Yes.

965
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,250
Don't you know I want
to be a cameraman in movies?

966
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:32,250
Look, you have been
saying that for four years.

967
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,542
You haven't been able to do anything.

968
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,625
Open a studio.
It will be good for you.

969
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:37,208
Look, I want to be a cameraman.

970
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,542
And I will surely be one.
You just fill water.

971
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:41,875
Look, I don't know what
you will do in the future.

972
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:45,083
Enough of your nonsense.
You just fill water. - Okay.

973
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,625
Why did you switch off the light?

974
00:45:55,917 --> 00:45:57,958
I didn't switch it off. What happened?

975
00:45:58,542 --> 00:45:59,500
Wait. I will check.

976
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,042
It's not working. - What?

977
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,708
Raja, you have your torch, don't you?
- Yes. Wait.

978
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,583
Man, this is also not working.

979
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:08,708
This is also not working.

980
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,792
What do we do now?
- Wait. I will check.

981
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:18,625
What noise was that? - I don't know.

982
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,208
Look, I am scared.

983
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:21,250
So switch on the light.

984
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:25,458
But what noise was that?

985
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,750
Some stone must have slipped.

986
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,083
I felt as if someone has
thrown a stone with all his might.

987
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,333
Wait. Let me check.

988
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:36,417
Where are you going?
- Raja, don't be so scared. Cool down.

989
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:39,750
In such isolated places
even a slight sound scares you.

990
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:49,000
Lulla, what are you doing?
Make the fire more intense.

991
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,125
Should I put both my feet inside?

992
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,042
Yes. Go ahead.
Jump inside. I don't care.

993
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:54,958
Let's do one thing.
Both of us will jump inside.

994
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:56,125
The fire will become intense.

995
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:58,833
Superb idea, Lulla.
Keep using your brains like that.

996
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,875
Yes. Come. You also jump inside.

997
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,292
First you jump inside.

998
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,458
How much longer? The aroma is amazing.

999
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,625
It's almost done.
Priya, pass the plate.

1000
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,958
Priya, tell me. What's cooking?

1001
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:12,792
Tell me. - What?

1002
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:15,333
Ask the lovebirds.

1003
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,708
BJ is cooking.
And Suhana is helping him.

1004
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:19,500
We are making instant noodles. - Wow!

1005
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,208
Food is ready.
First-come, first-served basis.

1006
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:25,000
If I come, how will I serve?
- Yes. Point.

1007
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,083
Lulla, taste it and tell me how it is.

1008
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,792
If it's not good, will you
order food from a five-star hotel?

1009
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,083
I am hearing your nonsense
since a long time. - Thanks.

1010
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,250
We will have to eat, however it is.

1011
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:42,083
You are such a moron, Lulla.

1012
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:44,125
From where do you bring
such scientific nonsense?

1013
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,458
Do you take some tonic?
Or are you like that since birth?

1014
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,167
Any problem? - I don't
want to argue with you. Leave it.

1015
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:50,750
Please. Please, guys. Chill.

1016
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:58,542
"O breeze, spread your fragrance."

1017
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,583
"I will meet her."

1018
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:03,042
"Let me meet her once."

1019
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:06,917
"Somebody's face is glowing again."

1020
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,708
"Somebody who was
lost has been found."

1021
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,583
Have both of them gone to sleep?

1022
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:18,542
Yes. As it is,
they had too many drinks.

1023
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:20,833
Okay.

1024
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:25,667
But Ms. Priya..you are
doing modeling, aren't you? - Yes.

1025
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,000
When are you going to sign a movie?

1026
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:30,042
I will do it.
Only if it's a big banner.

1027
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:31,375
That's right. - Tell me something.

1028
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:34,542
You are also going to be a DOP.
When will you be a DOP?

1029
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:37,000
Pass me water.

1030
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,333
Well..I am thinking
of assisting a few DOPs first.

1031
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,708
Later I will see what's in my destiny.

1032
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:45,708
Look, don't worry.
It's good when God..

1033
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,792
What happened? - What was that?

1034
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,125
What the hell, dude?

1035
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:56,083
At the mention of God, the fire
became so intense. - Are you okay?

1036
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,083
So weird.

1037
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,333
Perhaps there was something
below the fire. - Careful.

1038
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:01,125
Please. Keep your face away.

1039
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,625
Anyway, it's a good day today.

1040
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:07,583
So tomorrow is a new day.

1041
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,750
Guys, can you imagine?

1042
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,583
When we will reach the peak tomorrow..

1043
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,333
..what a scene it will be, man!

1044
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:15,625
I am just thrilled!

1045
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:18,208
Okay. Enough. I am sleepy. Okay?

1046
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:19,417
Goodnight. - Yes. Okay.

1047
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,917
Goodnight. - Today we are very tired.

1048
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,333
But listen, listen, listen.

1049
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:25,167
Just imagine. Imagine once.

1050
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:29,458
In this 8 km radius,
there are just six of us.

1051
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:30,958
I am switching off the bed light.

1052
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:33,542
Goodnight. - Okay.

1053
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,458
Yes, Priya.
Tomorrow we have to wake up early.

1054
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,083
Goodnight. - All of you goodnight.

1055
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:38,417
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1056
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:40,583
BJ.

1057
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:43,167
We have to leave by 6:30. - Okay.

1058
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:52,875
Oh God! - Oh man!

1059
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,000
I forgot to switch off the camera.

1060
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:05,792
Boss. - Yes.

1061
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,208
I think the food must have
attracted some wild animal.

1062
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:09,000
Yes.

1063
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:13,417
Or one of them must
have some nonsence.

1064
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,333
Tell me. Shall I wake them up?
Or let them sleep?

1065
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:22,625
Let them sleep for a while.
Please. - Okay.

1066
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:07,292
This wasn't here yesterday.

1067
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:04,083
Siddharth.

1068
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,833
Who is it?

1069
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:15,042
Come in front of me.

1070
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:24,500
Shukla, wake up. Shukla. Raja.

1071
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:26,167
Why are you trembling so much?

1072
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,875
He has fever.

1073
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,333
Raja. - What are you saying?

1074
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,000
He was fine last night.
He got fever all of a sudden.

1075
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:37,458
I think he had too
many drinks last night.

1076
00:53:37,542 --> 00:53:39,708
No. Drinking doesn't cause fever.

1077
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,583
Yes. It could be because
of exertion. - Okay.

1078
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:43,833
Let's do one thing.

1079
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:46,458
Let him rest here.
- No. We can't leave him alone.

1080
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:49,458
No. Let him rest.
Lulla, where is the medicine?

1081
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:51,125
I have it. I have it. - Yes. Give me.

1082
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:55,583
Listen. We are going
to the peak. Okay?

1083
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,833
Stay here till we don't come back.

1084
00:53:57,917 --> 00:54:00,250
Are you listening?
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

1085
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:02,333
We will be back by 10 o'clock.
Okay? - Fine.

1086
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:03,250
Come on.

1087
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,792
Take all the food items.

1088
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:10,417
We are forcing them to walk.
But we will have to do this.

1089
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,667
It's going to be a tough climb.
Wonder how they will manage.

1090
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,167
We will manage. - And yes.

1091
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,792
Lulla is very angry with you.

1092
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,708
Priya, do one thing.
Take that as well.

1093
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:22,000
Yes. I have kept it. I have kept it.

1094
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:27,375
Boss, what are you shooting?

1095
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,417
BJ, it's such a beautiful tree.

1096
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,583
Yes. It's a beautiful tree.

1097
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:34,792
Listen. Let's do one thing.
Let's mark this tree.

1098
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:36,250
So that we remember this route.

1099
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,083
Alright? - Yes. Good. Make a mark.

1100
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:43,333
Come on.

1101
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,417
Sid. - Yes.

1102
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,708
You were a rapist in your past birth.

1103
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:51,458
You have again started your nonsense.

1104
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:53,750
Of course.
You have been forcing me for so long.

1105
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,125
What did I do? - I am so exhausted.

1106
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:57,958
I am telling you let's go back.

1107
00:54:58,542 --> 00:55:00,083
But you aren't listening.

1108
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:01,292
Let's go.

1109
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:06,000
Moron! It's futile to talk to you.

1110
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,542
I am in a bad shape.
And you want to do trekking.

1111
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:17,708
Bro, do one thing.
Take a shower with that.

1112
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,042
You don't know how
bad my condition is.

1113
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:22,625
You are talking as if
you are the only person..

1114
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:23,833
..who is in a bad shape.

1115
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:25,708
All of us are exhausted.
But we are walking.

1116
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:28,208
You know why? - To carry my dead body.

1117
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:33,167
Lulla, seriously.
You will always be an idiot.

1118
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,625
This body pain is temporarily.

1119
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,708
But the memories of
this trek will last forever.

1120
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,083
Wow! Well said! Say it once more.

1121
00:55:41,292 --> 00:55:42,917
Let us hear it again.

1122
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,083
This body pain is temporarily.

1123
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:47,167
But the memories of
this trek will last forever.

1124
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,917
Damn! To hell with
you and your memories.

1125
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:52,083
It's taking us an
hour to walk an inch.

1126
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,750
And you are talking about memories.

1127
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,125
Boss.

1128
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:57,625
It's taking us an
hour to walk an inch.

1129
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:02,250
Lulla, we brought you along
because of your sense of humor.

1130
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:03,250
Take it.

1131
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:05,667
Come on. Today's quota is over.

1132
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,625
Shall I carry it?
- You leave it. I will bring it.

1133
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,458
I should have been smart.

1134
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:14,125
Feigning fever I should
have slept with Raja.

1135
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:16,250
Look, he is talking about excuses.

1136
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:19,167
Lulla, we have to
climb only one mountain.

1137
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,958
I am hearing your
nonsense since yesterday.

1138
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:24,292
Like that you have made
us climb ten mountains.

1139
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:27,042
Seriously, Lulla.
Only one mountain is left.

1140
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:28,792
Lulla is an idiot.

1141
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,417
Guys, Lulla has lost weight.

1142
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:33,417
Come on.

1143
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,333
Damn! The camera fell down.

1144
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:15,208
Thank God.
Nothing is wrong with the lens.

1145
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:18,792
The rewind button isn't working.

1146
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:37,042
Bro, why don't you die?

1147
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:40,625
Lulla, I will die only
after killing you first.

1148
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,125
Stop your nonsense and stand up.

1149
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,958
Can't you see?
It's such a beautiful panorama.

1150
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:45,958
They have also gone ahead.

1151
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:46,792
Get up!

1152
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:49,500
For the first time
you spoke the truth.

1153
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:53,792
Instead of seeing your wretched
face it's better I see the vista.

1154
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:12,292
Faster, Lulla. Faster.

1155
00:58:12,542 --> 00:58:15,833
You will shed all
your weight in this trek.

1156
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:16,917
Walk.

1157
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,750
Oh yes!

1158
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:34,875
Yes! Yes!

1159
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:40,083
Yes! Yes! Yes, BJ!

1160
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:42,583
We have reached the peak.

1161
00:58:43,542 --> 00:58:46,958
Oh God! Amazing!

1162
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,250
Beautiful!

1163
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:58,542
Wow!

1164
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:00,542
Yes! We have done it!

1165
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:02,708
Yes!

1166
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:06,083
Hats off to you. - Yes.

1167
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:12,958
We made it.

1168
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,750
Lulla, how is the scenario?

1169
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,917
Nothing great. It's okay.

1170
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,792
Idiot! That's what you will
say no matter where I take you.

1171
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:24,833
Quiet.

1172
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:28,375
Whoever comes here.. - Yes.

1173
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:30,250
He will have to click
a photo with this skull.

1174
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,500
Awesome! We did it! - Yeah!

1175
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:32,167
Yes! - We did it!

1176
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,833
Sid! - Cheers to all!

1177
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:37,333
What have you brought
along with the food items?

1178
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:39,000
Oh God! - Lulla!

1179
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:41,375
Lulla, what difference does it make?
Why do you worry? It's a nice thing.

1180
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:42,792
Come. Let's click a photo.

1181
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,958
It was my wish to leave
a mark on the mountain.

1182
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:50,333
Did you see my water bottle? - Yes.

1183
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:51,292
It's great fun.

1184
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:53,083
I don't know. - Sid! Sid! Sid!

1185
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:55,042
Yes. What happened?
- Your skull fell down.

1186
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,625
What? - What are you saying?

1187
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:00,250
Sorry. My hand hit it accidently.

1188
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:02,625
Did you drop it purposely?
- I am speaking the truth.

1189
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,542
Where it must have fallen?
- Oh no, Lulla!

1190
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:06,417
How far down it must have gone?

1191
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,250
Oh God! - What is that blue thing?

1192
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:11,750
That was the only mark.

1193
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:13,083
Look at there.

1194
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,417
We can see the sea from here.

1195
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,292
Yes, we can see it from here.

1196
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:33,500
Hey! How did the bag catch fire?
- Oh no!

1197
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:34,417
Oh God!

1198
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:35,833
How did that happen?

1199
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:37,333
How can it catch fire on its own?

1200
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,458
I think the fireworks
and paper plates in the bag..

1201
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:42,125
..must have got burnt
due to the scorching heat.

1202
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:45,750
What are you saying?
- The food also got burnt.

1203
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,292
What will I eat now?

1204
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:55,375
BJ, I don't feel
like leaving this place.

1205
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,750
Fine. Settle down here.

1206
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,708
We will live comfortably in the city.

1207
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:03,500
Let it be. Wonder whether
we will come here again or not.

1208
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:04,708
Let him enjoy.

1209
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:08,500
BJ, every year we will
go for trekking to a new place.

1210
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:09,542
What do you say? - Yes.

1211
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,667
I am not going to come.

1212
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:13,042
Priya. - Yes.

1213
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,583
We are going to rest
the whole day tomorrow.

1214
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:17,875
Then next day early morning
we have to catch the flight for Delhi.

1215
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:18,542
Okay?

1216
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,708
Yes. And please let's
do some shopping.

1217
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:22,208
Yes. We will do shopping too.

1218
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:23,625
Mr. DOG. - Thank you.

1219
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:25,542
Are you satisfied with the trek?

1220
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:28,125
Oh man! The trek is still not over.

1221
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:33,250
Our trek is incomplete till we don't
reach the starting point. Got that?

1222
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:38,458
We have reached the peak.
Now we have to only go back.

1223
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:42,042
The way we came here,
similarly we have to simply go down.

1224
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:45,292
Do one thing.
Keep your mouth shut and walk quietly.

1225
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,500
We miss Raja. - Yes.

1226
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,417
It would have been great
if he had also been here.

1227
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,250
He would have enjoyed with us.

1228
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,833
Sid is doing the recording.

1229
01:01:57,167 --> 01:02:00,750
We will show Raja the video
and share our experience with him.

1230
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:03,250
He will also have fun.
- Yes, Priya. You are right.

1231
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:05,792
After the trek all of us
will watch the video together.

1232
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:09,500
You were behaving as
if we won't have babies..

1233
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,542
..if we don't reach the peak.

1234
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,125
I want to ask you.
What did you gain at the peak?

1235
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:15,375
Did you do anything great?

1236
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:18,042
Physically we didn't gain anything.

1237
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:19,708
But emotionally we have gained a lot.

1238
01:02:20,042 --> 01:02:22,042
Sense of achievement, happiness.

1239
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:24,208
But Lulla, you won't understand.

1240
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,833
No. I can understand.

1241
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:35,750
My dear DOG,
I spoke nonsense with you.

1242
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:40,333
But after reaching the peak,
I was feeling very fresh.

1243
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:42,208
Isn't it? - My darling.

1244
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,083
My DOP.

1245
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:47,792
I love you.
Sorry, my director of photography.

1246
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,750
Amazing, Lulla! Amazing!

1247
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:54,083
BJ, did you hear what Lulla said?

1248
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:55,208
Yes. I heard.

1249
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:58,292
It's like Shahrukh is asking Salman,
"Are you on facebook?"

1250
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:03,167
Guys, on this note let's have it.
Glory to Lulla!

1251
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:06,167
Glory to the fatso!

1252
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:10,417
And glory to the sissy boy!

1253
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:14,375
Scoundrel. You call me a sissy boy?

1254
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,708
Do you know who threw that skull?

1255
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:18,250
Yes. Your hand hit it accidently.

1256
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:23,000
I didn't hit it accidently.
I threw it deliberately. - What?

1257
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:25,458
Did you understand?
Idiot- You hit it deliberately.

1258
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,833
First you threw the
flag and now the skull.

1259
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:31,333
Scoundrel!
Idiot! Rogue! What do I say?

1260
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,042
Lulla!

1261
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,042
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1262
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:36,333
Did you hear something?

1263
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:37,792
Yes. I heard something.

1264
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:44,333
Lulla!

1265
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,375
I think it is Raja's voice.

1266
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,625
Yes. It was Raja's voice. - Guys.

1267
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:49,375
The voice is coming from there.
Come on.

1268
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:50,500
Raja.

1269
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:51,667
Raja. - Raja.

1270
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,375
Raja. - Raja.

1271
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:55,458
Lulla!

1272
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:56,500
Raja, where are you?

1273
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,667
Raja. - Raja.

1274
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:01,458
Where are you? - Lulla, where are you?

1275
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:02,708
We are coming, Raja.

1276
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,958
Raja. - Raja.

1277
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,125
Raja. - Raja.

1278
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:08,375
Raja. - Come fast.

1279
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:10,833
Raja. - Raja.
Where are you?

1280
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:12,375
Raja. - Raja.

1281
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,542
Raja. - Raja.

1282
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,250
Raja.

1283
01:04:16,917 --> 01:04:19,375
Raja. - Raja.

1284
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,167
Raja.

1285
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:23,458
Now we can't even hear Raja's voice.

1286
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:27,333
What is he doing?
I told him to stay here.

1287
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,083
No.

1288
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,167
Damn! - Guys, it wasn't Raja's voice.

1289
01:04:37,292 --> 01:04:38,750
Have you not observed?

1290
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:41,250
Ever since we have come on this trek..

1291
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:42,917
..ever since we have come here..

1292
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,875
..weird things have been happening.

1293
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,917
At times a stone falls.

1294
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:51,125
The fire exploded.

1295
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:53,542
And the bag got burnt.

1296
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:57,333
And the water bottle. What about that?

1297
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,292
But Priya, it was just an accident.

1298
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:04,375
No. What about this sound?

1299
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,333
Was that too an accident?

1300
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:08,417
Hold on. What do you want to say?

1301
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,000
A ghost is doing all this?

1302
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:13,750
Oh God! I can't believe her.

1303
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,583
I don't know why, but whatever..

1304
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,083
..Priya is saying seems true.

1305
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:20,917
Damn!

1306
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:23,125
Okay.

1307
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,375
I want to test something.

1308
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:28,083
I want to test something.
Everybody sit down.

1309
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,167
So you think a ghost or a spirit or..

1310
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,292
..a supernatural power is doing this.

1311
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:41,958
Fine. If a supernatural
power is playing with us..

1312
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:45,792
..it will have to
drop this box like this.

1313
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:48,000
It's very simple. If it can do this.

1314
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,542
BJ, it's not so easy
to see these ghostly things.

1315
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:52,667
If it had been easy,
everybody would have seen it.

1316
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,458
Why? She can do it behind our backs.
But not in front of us?

1317
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:56,542
Is she afraid of us?

1318
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:59,042
Let her do it once.
Let's do it. Let's try.

1319
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:00,542
Yes. Of course. Let's try. - Isn't it?

1320
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:01,208
Do it.

1321
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,292
Just concentrate.
Ghost.

1322
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:08,250
The ghost will come and drop it.

1323
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:10,667
Concentrate.

1324
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,500
It's nothing, boss.

1325
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:54,083
Oh God!

1326
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,292
Get up. Priya, get up.

1327
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:04,583
Please.

1328
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,708
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1329
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:31,417
Where are we going?

1330
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:36,250
I think we came from here.

1331
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:39,417
No. We have to go this way.

1332
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,208
Come on.

1333
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:45,875
Suhana, Priya.

1334
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:46,833
Come on. - Come on, guys.

1335
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:47,917
Come on. - Come on.

1336
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:04,833
I think we are going
in the wrong direction.

1337
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,458
If we had been going
in the right direction..

1338
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,417
..we would have reached by now.

1339
01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,542
We missed the way.

1340
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,625
The compass is also not working.

1341
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:16,917
I am very thirsty.

1342
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:33,375
Come on.

1343
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,667
If we keep walking,
we will surely find some way.

1344
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,375
It's almost 3 to 4.

1345
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:40,083
And we are going in circles.

1346
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:44,500
Raja is also alone.
He also must be worried.

1347
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:46,250
Forget about Raja.

1348
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:48,625
He has enough food.

1349
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,875
And he even knows the way back.

1350
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,000
But we are in a mess.

1351
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,375
We have neither food nor water.

1352
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:58,833
Damn!

1353
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:02,875
Come on.

1354
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:08,875
I woke up at around 10:00-10:30.

1355
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:12,292
I felt as if somebody
is pulling my blanket.

1356
01:09:12,375 --> 01:09:14,292
I thought perhaps my friends are back.

1357
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,875
But when I opened my eyes,
there was nobody.

1358
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,083
I heard strange noises.

1359
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:28,667
Like someone talking
or someone walking.

1360
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:35,292
At around 3 o'clock
I decided to go back.

1361
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:38,500
And I went back to the forest guard.

1362
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,750
I told him everything honestly.

1363
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:43,458
The next morning they
started their search.

1364
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:45,083
Help!

1365
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,875
Help!

1366
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:49,417
Help!

1367
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:53,875
Help! - Help!

1368
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:57,458
Leaving civilization
we have come to this forest.

1369
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:59,958
Who will come to
help us in the forest?

1370
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,500
You are screaming for help.

1371
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,625
Your throat will get parched.

1372
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,917
And there is no water too. Keep quiet.

1373
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,583
That's it. I am very tired.

1374
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,292
I can't walk anymore.

1375
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:22,750
We have no idea where
we are and where we are going.

1376
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:24,875
And it's going to get dark too.

1377
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:27,042
Damn! Damn!

1378
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:30,542
We are very tired. Let's do one thing.

1379
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:33,125
We will start a fire and camp here.

1380
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,750
We are in deep trouble. And
you are talking about starting a fire.

1381
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:41,208
Are you gone mad? - Lulla, control.

1382
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:44,125
Calm down. - Keep quiet.

1383
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:45,833
Control him.
- It all happened because of him.

1384
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,417
Please, guys.
Please. - What happened because of me?

1385
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,750
I was telling him let's go back.

1386
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:50,833
But nobody listened to me.
- Please keep quiet.

1387
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:51,875
Lulla, no.

1388
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,792
Everybody was obsessed
about climbing the peak.

1389
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,625
Rogue! Weren't you?

1390
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:58,000
You were also delighted
on reaching the peak. - Please.

1391
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:00,167
You were saying all
your troubles have vanished.

1392
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,583
You flared up suddenly.
- You scoundrel!

1393
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:05,250
Hold him. Pull him back.

1394
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:07,292
Get lost! - Go back!

1395
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:09,417
Scoundrel! - Lulla!

1396
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,875
Go back! Hold the scoundrel!

1397
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:14,250
I will beat both of you!
I will beat both of you!

1398
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:18,042
Got that? He didn't know
we will face all these problems.

1399
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:20,208
Don't think about the problem, Lulla.
- Please.

1400
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:21,708
Think about the solution.

1401
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,792
Listen. - Calm down, Lulla.

1402
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,583
Everybody is with
you in your good times.

1403
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:27,583
But only friends come
in handy in bad times.

1404
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:29,250
Now your friendship
will come in handy, Lulla.

1405
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:31,667
Calm down.
Calm down. - Stop your nonsense.

1406
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:34,167
Hey! - Hunger had made my plight bad.

1407
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,833
Enough! - Yes. Did you hear?

1408
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:39,042
Nothing is going to affect him.

1409
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:41,042
Don't. - This glutton
is only concerned about food.

1410
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:44,167
If you call me glutton once more,
I won't spare you. - Go back, fatso!

1411
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:45,500
Go back! - Lulla, no.

1412
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:47,667
I will say again.
What will you do? - Stop him.

1413
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:51,458
Relax. - Please.

1414
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:53,333
Please.

1415
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:04,042
Lulla.

1416
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:06,375
Everybody supports you in good times.

1417
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,750
But a friend in need
is a friend indeed.

1418
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:12,125
And this is the time.
We should be together.

1419
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:14,042
Our wellbeing lies in that.

1420
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:17,583
Everybody. Everybody please be strong.

1421
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:18,917
Yes. - Please.

1422
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,625
Provided we are alive.

1423
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:24,167
You wanted to enjoy, didn't you?

1424
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,750
You wanted to take interesting shots.

1425
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:29,500
I will go to the peak.
You wanted to go to the peak.

1426
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:31,292
Yes. Why does it bother you?

1427
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,792
You rogue. Don't say
anything about my work. Okay?

1428
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,208
Our friendship is over.

1429
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:39,250
Is that so? Listen to me carefully.

1430
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:42,292
If anything happens to us,
then you and your camera..

1431
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,750
Get lost! Go back! - Please.

1432
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:44,917
Remember that. - Please, guys. Please.

1433
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:46,500
Quiet. Stay within your limit.
- Relax.

1434
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:47,500
Please.

1435
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:49,042
Come on.

1436
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,542
It's so strange.

1437
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:58,958
Till last night we were so happy.

1438
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,458
We were singing and dancing.
We were having fun.

1439
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,000
Today we are in a mess.

1440
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,958
That's why they say joy
and sorrow come unannounced.

1441
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:14,792
What happened, Lulla?

1442
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:22,250
I think I heard something.

1443
01:13:23,417 --> 01:13:24,708
What?

1444
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:29,375
Suhana, Priya, go and stand there.

1445
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,750
What? Why?

1446
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:36,500
Don't ask questions. Just do as I say.

1447
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:38,625
Now just go. Please.

1448
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,458
Okay. Both of you go together.

1449
01:13:43,292 --> 01:13:44,375
Please go.

1450
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:56,958
Lulla, why are you peeing here?
Pee at a distance.

1451
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:59,583
I have heard if we pee all
around and sit in the center..

1452
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:03,000
..then ghosts don't come near us.

1453
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:13,083
How will I pee when
I have not had water?

1454
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:27,042
I don't have a choice.
Now I will have to listen to anybody.

1455
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:29,292
Oh God! What are you guys doing?

1456
01:14:39,917 --> 01:14:42,208
Siddharth.

1457
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:49,583
Siddharth.

1458
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,667
BJ, Priya, Suhana, Lulla.

1459
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:57,042
Yes? - What happened?

1460
01:14:57,542 --> 01:14:58,208
My name.

1461
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:01,875
Suhana.

1462
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:20,417
Sid. Sid, switch off the camera light.

1463
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,000
Sid.

1464
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:25,875
Please switch off the light.

1465
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:28,208
Sid.

1466
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:37,042
There is somebody behind me.

1467
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:41,125
Priya, somebody is standing behind me.

1468
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,083
Sid. Sid, please. - Keep quiet.

1469
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:44,292
Please. Switch on the light.

1470
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,625
Suhana. Suhana, keep quiet.

1471
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,667
Please. Please, Sid.

1472
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,792
Help!

1473
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,250
Suhana.

1474
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,250
Help!

1475
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:02,292
BJ. BJ. Suhana.

1476
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:03,958
What happened?
What happened? - What happened?

1477
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,500
Back? - What happened?
- Remove the jacket.

1478
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:07,750
Carefully.

1479
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:08,917
Carefully.

1480
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:17,167
Oh God!

1481
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,625
No. Nothing.

1482
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:21,917
What happened? - Nothing.

1483
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,417
It has turned slightly red.

1484
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:26,750
Slowly. - Yes.

1485
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:29,583
Carefully.

1486
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:31,250
Relax.

1487
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,542
What is this? What is this?

1488
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:59,292
When people die and they are buried..

1489
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:02,833
..then headstones are
placed on their grave.

1490
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:05,333
For identification.

1491
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,042
Exactly like this.

1492
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:13,875
Okay. The sun is in this direction.
It means that is east.

1493
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:17,750
It means this is west.

1494
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:22,458
If we walk in this direction,
we might find a way.

1495
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:26,167
But on what basis can you say that?

1496
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:32,875
On the peak we saw that
the sea is towards the west.

1497
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,042
Oh! I guess. - Yes. Yes.

1498
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,833
You mean to say if we keep
walking in this direction..

1499
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:39,833
..we will directly jump into the sea.

1500
01:18:40,167 --> 01:18:43,000
Lulla, do you have a better idea?

1501
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,083
No. So keep your mouth shut.

1502
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:47,750
Priya, are you sure?

1503
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,250
No. No. I am not sure.

1504
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,667
I am just..I am just guessing.

1505
01:19:37,667 --> 01:19:40,792
Priya, are you okay?
- It's nothing. I just felt dizzy.

1506
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:43,167
Do you want to sit down? - No.

1507
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:45,042
We were sitting for so long.

1508
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:48,083
Now I am okay. Let's go.

1509
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:12,750
Careful. Careful.

1510
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,458
Priya! - Priya! Priya!

1511
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,000
Bhanu! Lulla! - Priya!

1512
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:20,333
What happened to Priya?

1513
01:20:20,542 --> 01:20:21,750
Guys, look. - Priya!

1514
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:23,292
What has happened to her?

1515
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:24,708
Water. I think water.

1516
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,917
Both of you stay here.
We will see if we can find water.

1517
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Quick. - Come on, Lulla.

1518
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,500
Where will we find
water in the forest?

1519
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:31,292
We will find it somewhere.

1520
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:33,708
Carefully. - Guys, keep calling out.

1521
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,542
Yes.

1522
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:35,833
Priya! Priya!

1523
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,625
I am really tense. Please.

1524
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,667
Oh God!

1525
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:45,125
Priya! Priya!

1526
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:46,958
Oh my God!

1527
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:50,500
I asked her. I am going for trekking..

1528
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:52,375
..with my boyfriend and his friends.

1529
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:55,292
Will you come?
She immediately said yes.

1530
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:58,708
Poor girl was very
upset after her breakup.

1531
01:20:59,292 --> 01:21:03,125
That's why I brought her here.
But what did I know?

1532
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,250
What do you think, Sid?

1533
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:11,792
Will we get out of the forest alive?

1534
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,625
Yes.

1535
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:19,500
Everything will be fine. Okay?

1536
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:23,625
Sid. Suhana.

1537
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:27,375
BJ! BJ, where are you?

1538
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:30,875
Wait. We are coming.

1539
01:22:09,542 --> 01:22:11,083
Priya! Priya!

1540
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:11,833
Priya!

1541
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,042
Priya!

1542
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:22,667
Priya! Priya!

1543
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:34,500
Priya! - Priya!

1544
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:37,417
Are you okay? Priya!

1545
01:22:41,542 --> 01:22:43,125
Priya. Easy.

1546
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,792
Oh God!

1547
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:51,208
For how long was I unconscious?
- Around half an hour.

1548
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:55,292
Half an hour. - Are you fine now?

1549
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:10,500
Please, do something.

1550
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:15,208
We have to get out of
the forest before it is dark.

1551
01:23:15,667 --> 01:23:17,042
Yes, Priya. You are right.

1552
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:27,458
Everybody listen to me.

1553
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:29,417
Come with me.

1554
01:23:50,042 --> 01:23:51,375
It means since yesterday
we were going in circles..

1555
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:52,625
..and we have come
back to the same place.

1556
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:55,125
Oh God! Will we always
wander in this forest?

1557
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:57,250
We will die of hunger and thirst.

1558
01:23:58,042 --> 01:24:00,500
Please, Lulla. Don't scare us more.

1559
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:02,792
Who is scaring you?
I am speaking the truth.

1560
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:05,125
Lulla, keep your mouth shut.

1561
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:07,083
BJ, tell me. What should we do?

1562
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,750
Come on. Take any path you want.

1563
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:14,042
Help! - Help!

1564
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,875
Help! - Help!

1565
01:24:17,042 --> 01:24:20,375
Help! - Help!

1566
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:22,708
Help! - Help!

1567
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:25,958
Help! - Help!

1568
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:02,667
Lulla, what are you doing?

1569
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:13,208
Can you see anything?
- Yes. I can see.

1570
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,625
What do you see?

1571
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:18,458
Our death ceremony function
is going on in our respective homes.

1572
01:25:18,542 --> 01:25:21,250
What is he doing?
- What do I tell him now?

1573
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:24,042
Tell him to look around carefully.

1574
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:28,125
Lulla, look around carefully.

1575
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,042
Do you see water,
smoke or anything else?

1576
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:33,625
I can only see forest all around.

1577
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,333
Climb higher and see.

1578
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:38,542
Do you see the way from where we came?

1579
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:40,333
Yes. I am looking.

1580
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:42,542
Fine. Come down, Lulla.

1581
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:44,042
Priya, don't cry.

1582
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:50,583
Come on. Hurry up.

1583
01:25:51,292 --> 01:25:52,917
This is the way out.

1584
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:57,083
Man, doesn't anyone want to go home?

1585
01:25:59,042 --> 01:26:01,833
BJ, I have found the way.

1586
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,750
Seriously? You found the way?

1587
01:26:05,292 --> 01:26:07,417
Yes. I even saw the cave mountain.

1588
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,375
Where our voices had echoed.

1589
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:13,208
Lulla, please.
Don't joke. Speak the truth.

1590
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:17,500
I swear on my father. I saw the way.

1591
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:19,750
Bro, did you see carefully?

1592
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,833
I think he is right.
- Can anyone joke at this hour?

1593
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:26,125
But you could have said
that from above too. - Yes.

1594
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:27,500
Yes. - Is that so?

1595
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,833
If I had told you from above,
wouldn't you guys..

1596
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:32,042
..have left me alone and run away?

1597
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:33,375
Come on now.

1598
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,250
Come on. - Come. Come.

1599
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,250
Lulla. - Yes.

1600
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:39,458
Tell me the truth. - Yes.

1601
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:41,917
You saw the route and
the echo mountain, right?

1602
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,583
Yes. I saw it.
Initially, it was very faint.

1603
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:47,042
When I observed closely,
I could see it clearly.

1604
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:51,792
Yes. He is right.

1605
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:53,708
He is not so clever
to speak such a big lie.

1606
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,042
We have found the way. - Yeah!

1607
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:58,833
We got it.

1608
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:02,917
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1609
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,542
We got it.

1610
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,125
Yes!

1611
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,333
Let's go.

1612
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:13,000
Yes! We got it!

1613
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,125
We have found the way.

1614
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:16,625
Yes! Yes!

1615
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:18,750
Yes! Yes!

1616
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,667
Amazing!

1617
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:25,417
Lulla, you are our hero!

1618
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
You have solved all our problems.

1619
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:31,458
Once we reach there,
you can ask anything from me.

1620
01:27:31,958 --> 01:27:32,750
I will give it to you.

1621
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:35,792
Buy me a branded liquor bottle.

1622
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:37,792
I will drink so much. - Done.

1623
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:40,500
That I will forget I
ever came for 2010's trek.

1624
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,667
Okay, Lulla. Okay.

1625
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:47,667
Lulla, turn around. Look here.

1626
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:51,292
I see. You don't
understand polite language.

1627
01:27:51,667 --> 01:27:54,333
Sissy boy.

1628
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:02,167
You had said you will
never speak to me again.

1629
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,083
What happened?

1630
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:06,708
Okay. Fine. It was my fault. Okay?

1631
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:09,792
I was wrong. You were right.
Come on. Let's shake hands.

1632
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:11,583
What do you say?
Friends?

1633
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:13,125
Okay, look. Look.

1634
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:15,417
Look. Smack this.

1635
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:17,292
Yes. Smack this.

1636
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,833
Melodramatic!
You are such a dramatic fellow!

1637
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:24,125
Moron! You did the
same thing yesterday.

1638
01:28:24,292 --> 01:28:26,000
Tell me.
Was it your fault or my fault?

1639
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:27,875
Tell me. Tell me.

1640
01:28:29,917 --> 01:28:32,917
Forget it as a nightmare. Please.

1641
01:28:33,042 --> 01:28:35,625
What? Forget it as a nightmare?

1642
01:28:36,167 --> 01:28:38,042
Am I dramatic or are you dramatic?

1643
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,292
I am really furious with you.

1644
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:43,167
Say it. It was your fault. Admit it.

1645
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:47,708
It's my fault. Okay? Fine?

1646
01:28:48,417 --> 01:28:52,125
Fatso. I know you since childhood.

1647
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,500
You make a mistake and then
put the blame on someone else.

1648
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,625
I don't understand how you do that.

1649
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:03,083
Okay. Lulla's face is glowing.

1650
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:05,042
Just like sunflower.

1651
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:07,083
Okay, listen. Forget all this.

1652
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:11,125
Tell me. How did you get
the idea of climbing the tree?

1653
01:29:11,417 --> 01:29:14,000
Because as far as I know, the tree..

1654
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:17,542
Hold on, Lulla.

1655
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:22,667
A thorn is piercing
my foot since a long time.

1656
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:27,292
Let me remove it.

1657
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,167
Let me check the other foot too.

1658
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:36,875
Okay, Lulla. Tell me something.

1659
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:41,000
If somebody asks you about
the most difficult time..

1660
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:43,208
..in your life, what will you say?

1661
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:48,500
I know you will say 2010's trek.
Isn't it?

1662
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:51,792
Yes. Come on.
There is nothing on this foot.

1663
01:29:52,292 --> 01:29:54,250
Come on, Lulla.
Let's go. Everybody must be waiting.

1664
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:00,833
Lulla.

1665
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:04,125
Lulla.

1666
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:06,417
Lulla, why are you standing like that?

1667
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:09,667
Lulla.

1668
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:14,042
Lulla.

1669
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:15,375
Lulla.

1670
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,375
Lulla. What happened
to your face, Lulla?

1671
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:24,000
You have teased me a lot.

1672
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:26,417
Now I will show you.

1673
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,458
What has happened?
I don't understand anything, Lulla.

1674
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:33,042
What are you saying, Lulla?
What happened?

1675
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,708
Lulla. Lulla, listen to me.

1676
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:38,333
Lulla, listen to me.

1677
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:39,833
Where are you going, Lulla?

1678
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:42,375
Lulla. Lulla.

1679
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:43,708
Lulla, stop.

1680
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:46,250
Lulla, I don't understand.
Lulla, tell me. What happened?

1681
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:47,625
Lulla.

1682
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:48,917
Lulla.

1683
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:51,000
Lulla, where are you going?

1684
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:53,750
Lulla. Lulla.

1685
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:55,083
Lulla.

1686
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:02,583
BJ! Suhana! Priya!

1687
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:04,667
Look, where Lulla has gone?

1688
01:31:08,292 --> 01:31:09,583
Lulla.

1689
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:12,792
Lulla.
Where are you?

1690
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:14,500
BJ, Lulla.

1691
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:17,042
Yes. Yes. Coming.

1692
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,458
What happened, Sid? What happened?

1693
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:23,542
BJ. - Yes. What happened?

1694
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:25,708
BJ, I came running here.

1695
01:31:25,792 --> 01:31:28,083
I don't know where Lulla has gone.

1696
01:31:28,333 --> 01:31:30,083
Lulla. - Lulla.

1697
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,417
Lulla.

1698
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:33,583
Lulla. - Lulla.

1699
01:31:33,792 --> 01:31:35,042
Lulla.

1700
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:36,708
Lulla.

1701
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,417
Lulla.

1702
01:31:38,667 --> 01:31:40,500
Lulla. - Lulla.

1703
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:42,625
Lulla.

1704
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:43,667
Lulla.

1705
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:45,250
Lulla.

1706
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,875
Lulla. - Lulla.

1707
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:49,417
His face had got disfigured. - Lulla.

1708
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,000
I don't know what happened.

1709
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,125
Lulla. Lulla.

1710
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:44,208
Bhanu!

1711
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:46,333
Priya. Bhanu.

1712
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,667
Suhana. - Suhana.

1713
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:04,792
Suhana.

1714
01:33:05,417 --> 01:33:06,625
Suhana.

1715
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:08,417
Suhana. - Suhana.

1716
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,917
Suhana. - Suhana.

1717
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:14,708
Suhana.

1718
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:16,000
Suhana.

1719
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:18,208
BJ. Priya. Look.

1720
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:20,292
Suhana. Suhana. Suhana. - Suhana.

1721
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:21,167
Suhana.

1722
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:24,083
Suhana. - Oh God!

1723
01:33:24,292 --> 01:33:25,375
Suhana. - Suhana.

1724
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:27,208
Oh God!

1725
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,125
We can't stay here after all this.

1726
01:33:32,292 --> 01:33:34,000
Please. Let's go.

1727
01:33:34,167 --> 01:33:35,417
Please. Let's go.

1728
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:37,042
Priya, okay. - Suhana.

1729
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:38,833
But Priya, how will we go at night?

1730
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:40,292
Let's wait for dawn to break.
- Suhana.

1731
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:43,250
Will we be alive by then? - Oh God!

1732
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:48,458
We will go in this direction.
We will surely find some way.

1733
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:49,875
Please. - Just walk like that?

1734
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,875
And Lulla.
What will we say to Lulla's mother?

1735
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:01,042
We will say something
provided we reach there.

1736
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,750
I am sorry to say.

1737
01:34:03,917 --> 01:34:07,375
But if we don't take
this difficult decision now..

1738
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:10,167
..I don't know what will happen to us.

1739
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:12,458
Let's go from here.

1740
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:14,958
Come on. Let's go. Please.
- Let's go now.

1741
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:17,083
Let come any difficulties
we have to go. - Lift her.

1742
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,042
Priya, are you okay? - What happened?

1743
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,292
Oh God!

1744
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,750
Let's go. Let's not waste time.

1745
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:42,625
I think..I think we are
going in the right direction.

1746
01:34:44,958 --> 01:34:46,125
Priya, carefully.

1747
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:47,875
Yes.

1748
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:53,083
Boss. - Sid.

1749
01:34:53,167 --> 01:34:54,333
Boss, what happened?
- Sid, what happened?

1750
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:55,958
Switch on the light anyhow, Sid.

1751
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:57,542
Sid. - Yes.

1752
01:34:57,833 --> 01:34:59,000
Please switch on the light.

1753
01:34:59,125 --> 01:34:59,917
Please switch on the light.

1754
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,250
I am trying. One second. One second.

1755
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:03,708
The battery is loose. - Switch
on the light anyhow. Sid, please.

1756
01:35:03,792 --> 01:35:04,708
I am trying. I am trying.

1757
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:06,792
I am trying. Hold on.

1758
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,167
Please switch on the light.

1759
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:12,750
The battery was loose.

1760
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:20,000
Wait, BJ.
Look. You had marked this tree.

1761
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:21,667
Look.

1762
01:35:22,667 --> 01:35:24,542
This side. - Yes.
We have to walk in this direction.

1763
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:25,750
Come on.

1764
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:26,625
Come on.

1765
01:35:30,417 --> 01:35:31,667
Priya, remove the first aid box.

1766
01:35:35,958 --> 01:35:38,667
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

1767
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,875
Please listen to me. It's 2 o'clock.

1768
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:44,667
If we wait till 5:30,
there will be some light.

1769
01:35:44,875 --> 01:35:45,708
We will leave then.

1770
01:35:45,792 --> 01:35:48,250
No. Right now.

1771
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:51,000
We have to leave right now.

1772
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:52,792
Priya, please understand.

1773
01:35:52,875 --> 01:35:54,750
What if we lose the way in the dark?

1774
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:56,500
Or what if there is another problem?

1775
01:35:56,958 --> 01:35:58,667
It's a great thing that
we have reached till here.

1776
01:35:58,917 --> 01:36:01,083
Let's wait for some light.

1777
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,917
Perhaps Suhana will
also regain consciousness.

1778
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,542
Siddharth.
Siddharth.

1779
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:35,125
Do you want water?

1780
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:36,667
Hold on. Let me see.

1781
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,125
I will wake up BJ. Hold on.

1782
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:41,917
No. Let him sleep.

1783
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,708
Okay. Let's go to the stream.

1784
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:49,042
Come on. Come on.
Carefully, Siddharth. Carefully.

1785
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:50,917
Easy, Siddharth. Easy.

1786
01:36:51,542 --> 01:36:52,542
Slowly.

1787
01:38:57,042 --> 01:38:58,333
Suhana!

1788
01:38:58,542 --> 01:39:00,042
Suhana..

1789
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:32,625
BJ. BJ. BJ, Priya.

1790
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:35,708
BJ. BJ.

1791
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:38,417
Oh God!

1792
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:42,708
Oh no!

1793
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:35,208
Siddharth.

1794
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:38,375
'On 28th October 2010 Bhanu Jairaj
and Suhana's bodies were found.'

1795
01:42:40,875 --> 01:42:42,958
'Despite a lot of search..'

1796
01:42:43,042 --> 01:42:45,875
'..Harsh Lulla and Siddharth's
bodies were never found.'

1797
01:42:47,167 --> 01:42:50,417
'And Priya was declared missing.'

1798
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:57,333
'After this incident trekking
in forest was totally banned.'
