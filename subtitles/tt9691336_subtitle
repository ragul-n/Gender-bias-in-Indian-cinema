You guys have to shoot from

I will keep a check on you...

100
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,320
I will smack you if the
speedometer crosses 100.

-Vizag.

00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,450
There was some problem on the bridge.

109
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,950
So, I took a diversion
and came on this route.

110
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,150
I didn't want to disturb
you as you were sleeping.

111
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,290
Ah, I am following Google maps,
so no problem.

112
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,370
Go straight...

113
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,780
But Sir, Google is
prompting to take a left.

114
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,240
You don't have to listen to Google.
Listen to me.

115
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,940
ok

116
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,450
lower the window pane and
breathe in some fresh air.

117
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,410
How does it feel to breathe
in the air of my place?

118
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,650
Is this your hometown, Sir?

119
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,440
This is where I grew up...

120
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,590
...my hometown.

121
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,530
Hey... there is the Railway station.

122
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,740
Did you know that my parents got
down here just after their marriage?

123
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,420
Hey!

124
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,770
This is the KGH hospital.

125
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,240
I was born here.

126
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,070
And there it is, Jagadamba theatre.

127
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,370
And you know the number
of movies I've seen there?

128
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
Can't even imagine.

129
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,780
There you see Crown bakery.

130
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,950
Though you are full, if you eat the
egg puff, it's just lip smacking.

131
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,110
And that is Sampath Vinayaka temple.

132
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,490
For every exam...

133
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,620
Hello!

134
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,820
I would definitely take
blessing here before every exam.

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Hey!

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,650

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,990
Just go a little faster and scare him,
that's about it.

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,320
-Just watch me do it.
-Go... go

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,180

Oh! Is it you, Bujji?

147
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,990
I was just wondering as to
who has the guts to scare me in this city.

148
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,150
Are you fine, Sir?

149
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,610
You started off so casually!

150
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,240
What's this respect now?

151
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,610
I must warn you to talk to
me casually! What do you say?

152
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,640

155
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:31,820
Hey!

156
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,300
-Alright, let's go, have some tea.
-Okay.

157
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,450
Has the wind changed its direction?

158
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,440
[parrots squawking]

159
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,360
Why are you looking away
as I ask you something?

160
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,700
Devudu, can I go around the school once?

161
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,070
Oh! No, how is that possible?

162
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,460
You should get a permission letter
from signed by your parents,

163
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,600
which should be approved by the principal

164
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,200
So definitely not possible now.

165
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,030
-Is that true?
-Are you kidding me?

166
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,650
This is your school.

167
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,150
Why do you ask? Go and have a look around.

169
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,320

173
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,450
Just now.

174
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,610
Take that stone.

175
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,380
I was just getting nostalgic, Devudu.

176
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,390
Here...

177
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,710
See that?
I knocked it without breaking!

178
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,650
Thank you.

179
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,290
By the way...

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,010
there was this thin stick
like fellow along with you

181
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,070
best friend of yours

182
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,600
he used to come from Maddilapalem.

183
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,480
Yes...

184
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,020
Do you meet him anytime?

185
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,670
Not really...

186
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,450
Everyone is busy with their own work

187
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,460
Oh! You took a picture of the school!

188
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,800
[phone ringing tone]

189
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,390
Here, speak to him

190
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,170
Hello...

191
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
It is me, the watchman of St. Aloysius

192
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,490
Oh! Watchman Devudu, how are you?

193
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,030
It is me Murali, do you remember me?

194
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,190
Yeah!

195
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,030
Murali, hope you are fine.

196
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,650
Yes it is me, watchman Devudu.

197
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,030
I was just asking about
you and he called you.

198
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,860
It is been a long time
since I spoke to you Devudu.

199
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,220
Yes.

200
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,480
Is your health fine?

201
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,260
Yes, yes, my health is fine.

202
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:11,150
We try our best, and beyond that whatever
is written in our fate will happen.

203
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,360
Ram, Murali wants to talk to you.

204
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,450
-Yes, tell me...
-Hey, Jumanji, what you doing there?

205
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,200
I don't know. No clue!

206
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,900
Well said!

207
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,450
By the way, how is the school?

208
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,610
Is it exactly the way it was?
Or did they refurbish it?

209
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,720
It is exactly the way it was.
Absolutely no change.

210
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,650
The same building,
same chairs, same tables...

211
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,670
-The same watchman.
-Hey! When did you snatch it?

212
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,890
Give it back!

213
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,150
Hey, give me a video call once.

214
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,570
Why?
Are you building walls around the sea?

215
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,490
Just call me once!

216
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,220
The thrill of visiting
directly is entirely different.

217
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,360
So buddy, has it been ten
years since we studied here?

218
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,700
Our school hasn't changed a bit!

219
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,990
Ten years? I'll slap you tight
to get the time sense back...

220
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,700
We were in 2004 batch, and it's 2019 now.

221
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,290
How much is nineteen minus four?

222
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,740
Oh! It has been fifteen years!

223
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,780
I just didn't realise it, dude!

224
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,150
We are getting old as well.

225
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,820
You are much better! You go around
many places because of your profession.

226
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,740
And I didn't even cross our state border!

227
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,860
By the way,
when are you coming to Hyderabad?

228
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,780
I am coming to Hyderabad
directly from Vizag.

229
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,150
I'll meet you as soon as I come there.

230
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,950
Can never trust you! Fake!

231
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,150
How come you went to
Vizag all of a sudden?

232
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,200
I'll explain it once I come there.

233
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,860
First of all,
send all our friends' numbers to me.

234
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,090
I have to speak to them.

235
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,400
Hey, do you even know how many are there?

236
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,650
And he wants to speak
to each and every one!

237
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,750
Then, what now?

238
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,710
With no restriction of time...

239
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,910
and to discuss unnecessary things
there is our school Whatsapp group.

240
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,860
Do you know who the
admin of that group is?

241
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,490
Who else can it be?
It must be you!

242
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,320
I know you since our schooling.
You never give a chance to others.

243
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,450
It is best to get appreciated
among all our friends!

244
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,280
I'll add you to our school
Whatsapp group. Be ready.

245
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,070
[message tone]

246
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,600
Welcome back to school Mr K.Rama Chandra

247
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,970
May I come in, please?

248
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,510
Come in, you latecomer!

249
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:18,850
Hi friends!

250
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,790
Buddy, welcome!

251
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,840
Come in Sir, respected photographer.

252
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,960
Buddy...

253
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,470
Enter the dragon.

254
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,640
Oh! Hello, Mr. Ram!

255
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,300
-Hi Ram!
-Hey fatso, where were you all these days?

256
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,300
No matter what, a hero is forever a
hero and a comedian remains a comedian.

257
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,430
Did anyone ever greet me
after joining this group?

258
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,430
How is that you appeared in
this group out of the blue...

259
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,590
while you are nowhere on
any other social media?

260
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,930
I have been to our school this morning.

261
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,800
The playground,
classroom reminded me of you all.

262
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,260
If possible I would like
to see you all in person.

263
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,280
Hey Ram, we are eager to meet as well.

264
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,890
What's the delay then? Let's meet.

265
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,640
Like Ram said,
we should all meet up sometime.

266
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,350
So you want to see us all, right!

267
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,510
Just wait and watch.

268
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,730
You have changed a lot.

269
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,110
He is not growing any young...

270
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,370
His age is melting away!
So he wants to meet us all.

271
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,230
What say you?

272
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,350
Admin is typing...

273
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,770
Then it is definitely
some important message.

274
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,400
Waiting...

275
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,270
It has been fifteen since
we finished our schooling.

276
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,690
Our 2004 batch should meet at the reunion.

277
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,020
Everyone can meet each other again.

278
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,200
I vote yes.

279
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,810
Awesome idea. Well said.

280
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,280
That is the prowess of a class leader!

281
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,100
Super...

282
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,270
Oh! I guess I have to say something.

283
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,150
Hey Murali, when have
you become so clever?

284
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,740
Nailed it!

285
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,310
Let us fix a place to meet
while everyone is online.

286
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,230
Vizag?

287
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,020
Let us all be done with it and
drown ourselves in the sea.

288
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,480
Only a few of us live in Vizag now.
The majority have shifted to Hyderabad.

289
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,650
While others have left
to USA, UK and Australia.

290
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,270
So, is Hyderabad fine?

291
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,560
-Okay.
-Super!

292
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,190
Hyderabad is the correct choice.

293
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,100
I am sure it is easily accessible
to our international friends.

294
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,620
Alright, but when do we meet?

295
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,940
Please fix the date.

296
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,040
Otherwise people will come up
with loads of excuses to avoid it!

297
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,310
True that!
We will plan it on a weekend only.

298
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,020
-What is the date today?
-January 4th

299
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,020
Alright. Exactly two months
from today, i.e., March 4th...

300
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,320
we will have our Reunion in Hyderabad.

301
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,560
Everyone must attend.
I will update the venue details soon.

302
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,240
-I am in.
-Double okay.

303
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,210
"Those who skip this will be ruined"
and this is my curse.

304
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,180
Why such agony,
I am here to give you some comfort.

305
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,310
Thanks Ram, it's because of you
that we are going to meet again.

306
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,440
Yes, Mr. K.Rama Chandra, "Amar Rahe"

307
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,170
Shut up, that is said
when a person is dead.

308
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,690
Someone, please request my wife.

309
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,020
She will definitely not
allow me if I ask her.

310
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,460
Can I get my kids along?

311
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,260
It's a little difficult
to leave them alone.

312
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,360
Please come as a family.

313
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,170
This reunion is the best thing we've
done so far after forming this group.

314
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,180
Hi, friends...

315
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,810
She is my wife... Shakuntala.

316
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,930
And he is my son... Vinni.

317
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,060
Ah! It is Srinu!

318
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,170
-Hey!
-We will meet regularly as you stay here.

319
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,890
-Hi!
-Hi...

320
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,100
How are you?

321
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,230
-How are you doing?
-I am good

322
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,720
She hasn't changed a bit.

323
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,350
Didn't I ask you to take left after
the temple and take the second right?

324
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,850
Who asked you to take the left?

325
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,060
Well, come back to the temple again.

326
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,390
I know the route only from there.

327
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,840
Yes, please come there.

328
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,740
[groans]

329
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,750
[chuckles]

330
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,440
Well, then... Go now!

331
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,390
You wait. Come to the temple!

332
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,390
Why hasn't he turned up yet?

333
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,470
I trusted him and even
ordered some extra food.

334
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,100
I have already called him thrice.

335
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,060
He has warned me that he will
break my leg if I call him again.

336
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,770
Yet, I gathered courage
and called him again.

337
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,060
Now I am scared if he is going
to break my leg or call me!

338
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,010
What is this? Gulab Jamun?

339
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,350
Ah, Zandu Balm, want to eat it?

340
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,360
[sighs]

341
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,770
[lady screams]
[men cheering]

342
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,890
-He wrote a poem on Facebook for the girl.
-Is it? Tell me.

343
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,410
-"Swathi!"
-Hey!

344
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,480
-Hey!
-Hey, please!

345
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,440
"Swati, seeing you I lose my mind,

346
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,750
"Open the doors of your
heart for me, be kind."

347
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,240
-Trying to make a rhyme!
-Hey, please...

348
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,770
-Hey...
-Ram is here!

349
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,110
[men screaming]

350
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,900
Hey, hey, wait, wait...

351
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,140
Hey! Hey!

352
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,250
"A friend is for life,
and friendship is permanent."

353
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,000
Hey, what is it?

354
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,630
Your sister is very annoyed.
Go and find out.

355
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,470
-Where is she?
-Right there.

356
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,640
-I am coming.
-I guess someone is "red hot".

357
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,180
Someone here promised me
that they would meet me the next day!

358
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,720
I think I should just kill him

359
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,270
Hey, niece, your uncle is here.

360
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,560
-Niece?
-What if it is a boy again?

361
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,020
-Will you leave him?
-Hello

362
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,370
I wanted a niece this time,
and a niece it would be.

363
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,140
I even thought of a name, Ambuja.

364
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,720
-You agree to it as well.
-What say you sweetheart?

365
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,890
Alright!
Enough now, have this sweet.

Hi Satish! How are you?

368
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,710
Hmm, you talk to me well now,
now that you are married and have kids.

369
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,970
Back then, you always ran
away as if I was a monster.

-Oh...

and she has a good helping nature,

-He is in Paris.
-Oh is it? He didn't tell me!

384
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,630
He asked me not to tell you.

385
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,350
What are these pictures?

386
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,470
It is all dark.

387
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,350
Can you see anyone in the picture?

388
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,470
And you boast of being a big photographer.

389
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,100
So has everyone arrived?

390
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,720
Should I ask them to serve the food?

391
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,270
-Still four more to come.
-I've sent the address to three of them.

392
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,610
Who is the fourth one?

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,870

-Huh?

Why don't you answer me?

396
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,010
Why are acting smart
instead of answering me?

397
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,070
Who is it?

398
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,220
Why isn't he telling me when
I'm asking him repeatedly?

399
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,940
Who is it?

400
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,860
-Huh?
-Huh?

401
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,780
It's Jaanu.

"Like the tunes on a Veena,"

408
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,060
"In the courtyard of hopes,
laid are the thoughts as rangoli."

409
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,270
Jaanu meant song for all of us,

410
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,970
But music meant the world for Jaanu.

411
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,100
She'd always sing,
or talk about songs all the time.

412
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,270
She used talk about tune, pitch and all.

413
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,220
And I wouldn't understand a thing.

414
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,960
Even before she was born,
their parents decided to name their baby

415
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,880
BalaSubramanyam if it is a boy
and Janaki if it is a girl.

416
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,180
I wonder at what a moment
they named her Janaki Devi...

417
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,680
She would never sing any song other
than the ones sung by singer S. Janaki.

418
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,180
Except for one song.

419
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:18,750
"A Jasmine garland for
my sweet Mother Telugu."

420
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,440
"Reverence to the Mother
who gave us birth."

421
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,220
For once it feels like Jaanu
has originally sung that song.

422
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,520
Whenever I hear that song,
her face flashes my mind.

423
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,380
I love Jaanu's songs...
and Jaanu too so much.

424
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,990
She knows that too.

425
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,230
If I have an attendance of ninety percent
in school, then it's all because of her.

426
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,060
We have been studying
together since pre-school.

427
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,810
And whatever she wants, she asks me alone.

428
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,720
And I hear to all that she says.

429
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,770
If at all I score less marks,
get scolded by parents,

430
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,430
or feel sad, no matter what...

431
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,220
Jaanu somehow got to know about it.

432
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,970
She would just ask me what happened.

433
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,270
And that would make all my worries vanish.

434
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,520
They'd jus fly away.

435
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,970
I would feel the strength
of a thousand elephants.

436
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,180
And feel like knocking everyone down.

437
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,930
I do not know about my feelings for Jaanu.

438
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,970
Whenever I went to a temple I
would only wish for one thing.

439
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:43,020
That my Jaanu should forever
be in the span of my eyesight.

Today we are going to
learn about cell biology.

452
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,670
Cell biology is the study of
cell structure and function,

453
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,220
and it revolves around the concept...

454
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,140
that the cell is the
fundamental unit of life.

00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,070
Everyone in the class
except for me greeted her.

532
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,980
All of you, go to your places!

533
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,120
But deep down inside my heart...
I wanted to hold her hand...

534
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,360
ask her about what happened,
ask her about her well being.

535
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,040
And to tell her how
miserable I felt missing her.

536
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,380
But I just could not.

537
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,270
Why did you come to school
when you're so ill?

538
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,500
I am feeling okay.

539
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,120
Why don't you stay at home and take rest?

540
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,180
It's fine madam.

541
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,740
-Okay, Subha please take care of her.
-Okay Miss.

542
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,640
[class lecture continues]

543
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,580
I was not sure of how to
express my feelings in words.

544
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,120
But for all I know,
that was the first love in our class.

545
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,840
I could not understand
what was happening to me.

546
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,140
There was some kind of
mysterious joy within me.

547
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,580
I felt like I was flying in the sky.

548
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,040
When alone, I'd keep
grooming my faint moustache.

549
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,910
And after that,
I could never talk to Jaanu.

550
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,910
There was some kind of hesitation

551
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,660
I used to hide when I saw her.

552
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,580
But I couldn't hold this
feeling from Shubha.

553
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,580
We thought no one could
decipher the language of our eyes.

554
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,740
But one fine day,
Satish got to know about this.

555
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,290
Hey, since when is this happening?

556
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,740
You never told me about this!

557
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,040
Once Satish gets to know about something,
Murali will definitely know.

558
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,200
Don't ruin your studies
by getting distracted.

559
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,620
You ought to study well. Okay?

560
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,120
Do you have anything to ask me?

561
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,200
Or are you sacred?

562
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,740
Alright then, can I leave?

563
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,120
What happened?
Did he say something?

564
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,700
Hey, what did you speak with her?

565
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,160
-Nothing at all!
-Oh my God!

566
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:04,960
[indistictive chatter]

567
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,260
Silence.

568
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,870
Why are you shouting like crows?

569
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,370
Jaanu, please come here.

570
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,880
Dude...

571
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,870
Ask her to sing "Yamuna thati lo"

572
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,660
Jaanu, Jaanu...

573
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,540
He is asking you to sing "Yamuna tati lo"

574
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,990
"Should I be the lighting
amidst the clouds..."

575
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,390
"or come down like drops of rain?"

576
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,460
"Should I be the roaring
waves of an ocean..."

577
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,410
"or become the colors
in the streets at dusk?"

578
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,540
Didn't I request her to sing that song?

579
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,620
She is purposefully doing it.

580
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,080
Can you please sing the
"Yamuna thati lo" song?

581
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,660
Ram is asking for it.

582
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,660
Sis, Ram has snatched my geometry box and
forcing me to ask you to sing that song.

583
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,330
What is such a big deal about that song?

584
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,950
He is dearly requesting you,
what the big deal in singing it once?

585
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,080
Jaanu, it is the audience request.

586
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,160
Can you please sing the song
"Yamuna thati lo" from Dhalapati movie?

587
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,580
Mr. Maddelapalem,

588
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,570
They play the song we want, only
when we ask even in All India Radio,

589
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,470
tell this to the one from Appanna Colony.

590
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,350
Murali,

591
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,950
Is she okay with it?

592
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,840
Look now...

593
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,470
"You being there and me being here..."

594
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,350
"The song being here
and the words there..."

595
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,710
"The person being here and the
heart there... even after a long time."

596
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,060
"You being there and me being here..."

597
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,910
"The song being here
and the words there..."

598
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,270
"The person being here and the
heart there... even after a long time."

599
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,430
"Your words being my hopes..."

600
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,880
"your thoughts being my vows"

601
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,700
After that, I requested her to sing the
song many times but she never sang.

602
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,530
The Devil.

603
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:03,510
-Happy Birthday!
-Thank you!

604
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,580
Have this chocolate.

605
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,890
-Did you go to the temple?
-Yes, I went early in the morning.

606
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:08,950
Where is your brother?

607
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,680
Wait,

608
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,050
Where did you buy this dress?

609
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,270
Bomanna brothers?

610
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,270
No Chandana Brothers,
it is my father's choice.

611
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,550
Bava, let's go...

612
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,540
Turn around now...

613
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,290
Here, take these chocolates...

614
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,250
Take another.

615
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:35,930
One is enough

616
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,080
You have grown so big,
how can one suffice?

617
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,560
Take another

618
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,910
Hey don't leave, otherwise,
I will get smacked.

619
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:50,830
Thank you.

620
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,990
Just a thank you?
Tell me what is it today?

621
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,990
Won't you wish me?

622
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,990
Hap... happy...

623
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,080
Happy? New year, isn't it?

624
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,090
Happy Birthday.

625
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,850
Thanks.

626
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,540
Why are you sweating profusely?
Did anyone say anything to you?

627
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,040
Leave me man.

628
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,320
Hey, my brother is a sportsman,
and that is the reason. What do you say?

629
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,910
[heart beating fast]

630
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,530
What happened?

631
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,330
Why is your heart beating so fast?

632
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,580
What happened?

633
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,080
Check it for yourself.

634
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:43,110
[heart beat racing]

635
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,040
Hey brother, what happened to you?

636
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,580
-Why are you falling unconscious?
-Ram, Ram!

637
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,730
Hold him! You go get some water.

638
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,890
Shubha did not understand
what made me unconscious that day.

639
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:01,620
And Jaanu couldn't understand what she did
to me, that my life was dedicated to her.

640
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,450
Hey, buffalo, what happened to you?
Why did you faint?

641
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,290
But I, K. Ramachandra studying in
class 10, had no other thought.

642
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,910
Just like a straight
line drawn on a slate...

643
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,950
all my thoughts were about Jaanu.

644
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,330
Do you know what will be the name of
Jaanu once she gets married to me?

645
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,120
Janaki Ramachandra

646
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,620
Hey Jaanu...

647
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,450
Days passed by like passing waves.

648
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:26,820
Aren't you ashamed to write the
exams with the help of slips?

649
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,510
Sorry madam

650
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,490
-What sorry?
-Please Madam.

651
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,620
-Leave me for once.
-Move, let's go...

652
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,620
What else...
We have two months of holidays.

653
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,540
I wonder how you can
stay without seeing us?

654
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,430
Hey Jaanu, quick...

655
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,740
Hey, Subha... for how long will
you be so informal in calling her?

656
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:56,300
You know you have the right,
why don't you call her sister-in-law!

657
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,810
I know that...
You go get the bicycle

658
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,860
-Move!
-Ah!

659
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,870
I did not answer this question. Did you?

660
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,200
Alright, I'll leave now.

661
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,740
Don't forget this.

662
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,510
Happy holidays!

663
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,370
[indistinctive kids chatter]

664
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,370
When did she tell you that she is coming?

665
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,370
I have been calling her since a week.

666
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,330
She would neither take my calls
nor reply to my messages.

667
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,640
And I assumed that she will not turn up.

668
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,370
And after that?

669
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,330
She messaged me just
today that she is coming.

670
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,850
You didn't bother to tell me, is it?

671
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,080
It isn't like that.

672
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,430
She is in Singapore, right?

673
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,720
I thought leher come first.

674
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,080
Why does he still behave
like he did in school?

675
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,080
Just that his uniform is missing!

676
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:47,080
Hey, come here...

677
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,700
I will smack you!

678
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,520
Come...

679
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,690
Get lost!

680
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,530
It's Jaanu...

681
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:45,160
Jaanu!

682
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,100
Hi Jaanu...

683
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:47,940
-How are you Jaanu?
-Hi.

684
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:48,970
-How are you Jaanu?
-Hi.

685
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:49,950
she is my daughter.

686
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,100
-Here...
-Say, thanks!

687
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,950
You have to share it
with the others, okay?

688
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,780
Hi, how are you?

689
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,620
Sorry, I am a little late.

690
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,740
You have made it at least now,
and we are glad you did.

691
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,160
Are you all happy that I came in?

692
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,370
Thank you, Madam...

693
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,620
Satish, come here.

694
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,990
How are you dear?

695
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:31,280
I am good.

696
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:32,630
-Which month?
-Seventh!

697
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,120
First is a boy.
And this is my second.

698
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,660
I didn't expect so many to turn up.

699
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:38,840
Is this all your planning?

700
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,990
It was all a combined effort.

701
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,510
I did not expect this either.

702
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:46,410
I thought a lot would
drop out in the last minute.

703
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,280
I got a lot of extra food made for this.
And that was another tension.

704
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,240
But almost everyone came.

705
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,580
He ate all the ice creams since he came...

706
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,700
didn't care to save some for the kids.

707
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,240
Go...

708
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,620
I least expected you to come.

709
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,340
[balloon burts]
Aw!

710
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,080
Damn you...

711
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,580
Why are you playing with
the balloon like a kid?

712
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:19,870
Why aren't you coming there?

713
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,370
You go, I will be there...

714
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,680
Come on...

715
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:23,870
Get lost...

716
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,660
Jaanu is here...

717
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,160
-I will come, you just go...
-Hey, come now

718
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:30,580
-Damn you...
-Oh god!

719
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,200
Listen to me. go

720
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,410
Hey, I am old now.

721
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,400
If you hit me like you did
in school, I'll be dead.

722
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,830
You please go, I will come.

723
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,530
Get lost you pig!

724
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:47,280
All of my family were in
Singapore last summer.

725
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:50,740
If I knew you were there,
I would've definitely met you.

726
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,910
-Do you have your family picture?
-Oh! Yes.

727
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,370
Where is he?

728
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,080
He is smacking me, if I'm going there...

729
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,450
You go ask him yourself.

730
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,370
You are not worth anything!

731
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,930
What happened?

732
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,490
Ram has come.

733
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,410
He is hiding there and
refuses to come here.

734
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,660
-Hi Jaanu!
-Hey, hi...

735
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,730
-The muscles don't show up.
-Hey, hi...

736
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,340
How are you?

737
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:52,930
-Hi Jaanu,
-How are you?

738
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,680
-Hi, Namaste...
-Namaste...

739
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:56,160
-Please sit down,
-You didn't pay heed to me!

740
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,260
Hey, sorry, sorry...

741
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,240
All of you go to your places.

742
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,160
Anji babu...

743
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:10,140
Present Miss.

744
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,440
-Bharati,
-Present Miss.

745
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,170

746
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,560

747
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,310

00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,030

00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,950

750
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,410

751
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:22,790
-Kusuma,

752
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,620
-Mahendra...

753
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:26,200

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,830

-Susheela,

758
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,740
-Yamini,
-Present Miss.

759
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,700
Miss, you have not called
out K.Ramachandra's name.

760
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,530
His name is not in the register.

761
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,120
I think he is in another group.

762
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,490
You may go and check in the recess.

763
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,830
Is Ram in your group?

764
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,080
No! I thought he is in your group.

765
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,580
Don't you guys know that
this boy got his T.C.?

766
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,120
Why did he take a T.C.?

767
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,240
Hey, you keep calling her a brother...

768
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,740
Don't you even know where he is?

769
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,700
I swear I do not know.

770
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,370
I came from my hometown this morning.

771
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,530
Where did he go without informing us?

772
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,080
Hey, we'll visit his house in the evening.
ell know what happened.

773
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,450
Who is that?

774
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,000
The guy from this house, named Ram...

775
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,870
-What?
-I mean Krishnamurthy uncle...

776
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:11,850
Is nobody home?

777
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,020
Oh! Krishnamurthy...

778
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,120
Oh! What can I say!

779
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:20,410
His father had many debts,
so they had to sell their house.

780
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,580
That is their ancestral home.

781
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:28,200
In fear of losing dignity,
they shifted to Hyderabad,

782
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,780
But their location in
Hyderabad is unknown.

783
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:38,870
Sad that both he and
his mother knew of it...

784
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,030
only that night.

785
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:52,740
"My dream left me, like a lie."

786
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:03,230
"How can I ever..."

787
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:07,090
"believe this truth!"

788
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,840
"My peace is destroyed"

789
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:18,210
"Sorrow peeped in for the first time"

790
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,020
"I've turned into a stone"

791
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,960
"Why don't you come before me?"

792
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:34,640
"Why don't you explain
the truth to my heart?"

793
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,670
"give me the answer..."

794
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:46,390
"Without you beside me"

795
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:52,570
"even the classroom looks dull"

796
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,530
"In this manner"

797
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:02,510
"Unable to remember to forget you"

798
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:09,740
"My heart is searching
for you again and again"

799
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:17,550
"Whose crime is this actually?"

800
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,230
"How can I ask that?"

801
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:25,180
"The river of tears
flowing out of my eyes"

802
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,470
"How can I stop it?"

803
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:33,340
"What a burden is it on my heart..."

804
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,420
"How do I convey this to you?"

805
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:41,250
"How can I believe so easily..."

806
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:45,050
"That this is the goodbye?"

807
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:09,880
Ram...

808
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,200
Hi...

809
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,490
Hi...

810
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,160
Did you recognize me? It is Jaanu.

811
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,850
Yeah...

812
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:29,870
How are you, Ram?

813
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:34,120
I'm fine.

814
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,580
It is unbelievable!

815
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,660
I never thought we'd meet like this again.

816
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,330
Fifteen years...

817
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,910
To be precise... seventeen years!

818
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,120
You look so different!

819
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:54,120
You didn't even have your mustache
the last time I saw you.

820
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,660
What do you do, Ram?

821
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,370
[heart pounding faster]

822
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,540
Travel...

823
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,370
Travel photography...

824
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,740
[heart pounding faster]

825
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,470
[heart pounding increases]

826
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:26,860
-I am fine, nothing happened to me.
-Tsk! Shut up!

827
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:31,130
Is this what you do if I leave the
kid with you for just five minutes?

828
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:31,610
Tsk!

829
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,400
What is this?

830
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,750
She came here after so many years.

831
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,760
And you had to fall
literally just by seeing her?

832
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,160
I just slipped. Didn't see that.

833
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,530
Hmm...

834
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,450
By the way, did he talk to you
or just lost it seeing you?

835
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:01,080
Ss... Sorry.

836
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:05,050
Did she come all the way
from Singapore for this?

837
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,180
Instead of asking her at
least how she is doing,

838
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,260
how can you still behave like a kid?

839
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,680
Well... She got married
and had a daughter too.

840
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,320
Did you at least ask her about that?

841
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,390
[scoffs] You are simply great!

842
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,210
Did you all have food?

843
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,460
Didn't you eat?

844
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,170
Usually, I do not eat during flight trips.

845
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:35,090
Hey donkey, run to that
tree, touch it and come back.

846
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:36,310
-What?
-Tsk!

847
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:38,060
Just go.

848
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:39,760
Okay... Okay...

849
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:44,050
Hey, if you come back soon,
you will have to run again.

850
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,090
Okay...

851
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,910
Hello, are you still at the temple?
Then we will meet you next year!

852
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:49,140
-That's best.
-Hey...

853
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,020
What is this?
What are you up to?

854
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,060
This is not going right!

855
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:03,590
Sister-in-law, are you
bribing me or something?

856
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:10,050
My dear sister-in-law, please walk slowly,
touch the tree and come back.

857
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:11,090
-Huh?
-You may please go.

858
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:20,020
Hmm...

859
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,890
Thank you

860
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,220
Didn't you eat?

861
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,720
I will eat later...
You eat it first.

862
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:54,540
Phone...

863
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:12,300
[phone rings]

864
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:32,080
[phone rings]

865
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,780
Hey, pick up the phone.

866
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,130
Ahem...

867
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,470
Sir, tell me.

868
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,930
These guys seem to be advancing fast.

869
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,700
I have observed it too, sir.

870
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,400
Hey, I am worried they might just pick up

871
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,370
from where they've
exactly left in the school.

872
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:57,640
Hmm... Yes, sir.
I am feeling the same.

873
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,260
Hope nothing happens, right?

874
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,600
No... No... Don't worry at all, sir.

875
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,440
The project is a safe project, sir.

876
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,020
Merger is not happening.
I can vouch for that, sir.

877
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,890
You didn't eat, right?
Here you go, eat this.

878
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:01,880
-Hey...
-Yes...

879
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,750
-What is happening there?
-What do I know?

880
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:11,280
What if something happens
that's ought not to happen?

881
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,890
That is not my fear.

882
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:13,930
Then?

883
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,930
What if something that should
not happen, ensue anyway?

884
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,390
And if her husband in Singapore
gets to know of it,

885
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,040
and enquire about who the organisers are,

886
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:27,100
and comes to know that it is us... Imagine
what would happen if he comes after us.

887
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:28,950
It would be clobbering time.

888
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:32,930
Hey, shut up dude. I am already scared.

889
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,730
[mic echoes]

890
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:37,850
I am very thankful to all
those who have made it.

891
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:41,550
And for those who did not attend I
would like to state only one thing.

892
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,010
You have missed an amazing
opportunity in your life.

893
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,150
Because we don't know when
might this event happen again or

894
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:51,180
Because something like this may
or may not happen ever again.

895
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:56,900
Anyway, on the behalf of 2004
batch of St Aloysius school,

896
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:02,930
I would request our most
admirable Jaanu to say a few words.

897
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,010
Jaanu, can you please come on stage?

898
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,430
Aha... The singing nightangle...

899
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:11,660
The singing angel...

900
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,020
Your words are sweet...

901
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,230
-Oh man!
...and your songs are sweeter.

902
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,350
My dearest, the way you sing is heavenly.

903
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,010
Dear nightingale of Vizag, come on speak.

904
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:25,510
I am so happy.

905
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,550
I feel like a small kid again.

906
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:31,680
I thought everyone would have been
changed with the changing time.

907
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,970
But nothing has changed.

908
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:46,720
I feel like going to school all over
again wearing our blue and white uniform.

909
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,340
Thank you.

910
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,330
Hey Jaanu, sing a song before you leave.

911
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:57,160
I just had ice-cream,
my throat doesn't feel right.

912
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,470
No problem, this is not a
competition. Just sing for fun.

913
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:02,760
Hey, Murali...

914
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:04,490
Murali... Murali...

915
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,000
Ask her to sing "Yamuna Tati Lo" song.

916
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,450
"Yamuna Tati Lo" song. Please, dude.

917
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,050
"Yamuna Tati" song?

918
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,230
Please... Please...
Ask her... Ask her...

919
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:21,800
"I am not sure of the penance that I did"

920
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:27,640
"that I got this loving result"

921
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:33,130
"I wonder which God will bless you"

922
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:39,020
"with such a rare boon..."

923
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:44,780
"Oh my heart, listen to me...
he is very handsome"

924
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:50,250
"he isn't easily available
to be your pair..."

925
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:55,050
"So stop dreaming these
silly things, my heart."

926
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:01,690
"Oh my heart, don't get thrilled"

927
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:07,260
"Don't desire excessively"

928
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:17,730
[applause]

929
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,990
In unison: One, two, three...

930
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,380
[cheering] [party cracker bursts]

931
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:32,500
Everyone: Yeah!
[camera clicks]

932
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:35,730
[camera clicks]

933
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:40,030
Ready?

934
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,660
-Ready... Ready... Ready...
-Just a moment... Just a moment...

935
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,190
Handkerchief...
Does anyone have a handkerchief?

936
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:47,660
Yeah...

937
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,000
Tsk... Hey, look here.

938
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:51,950
[camera clicks]

939
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,950
Yeah! [camera clicks]

940
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,910
It went so well, isn't it?

941
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,790
-I hope your family is doing good.
-Yes, they are all good.

942
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:06,440
-Actually, I'm very happy to meet you all.
-We are happy too.

943
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,360
Definitely.

944
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:16,330
I have personally monitored
and got these decorations done.

945
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:22,220
And these Chinese lights are very
famous. They are found only in China.

946
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,510
And I made sure that our school logo...

947
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,920
[phone rings]

948
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,670
-Yes, I am coming.
-My head is severely aching.

949
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:45,210
Let's have coffee on the way.

950
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,530
Well, shall we leave?
The vehicle has arrived.

951
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,690
How long is your stay in India?

952
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,980
Stay? I have an early
morning flight tomorrow.

953
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,680
Why are you in a hurry?

954
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,390
I couldn't book a
ticket in the last minute.

955
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,390
And I just got a connecting flight.

956
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,220
So, I have to go to Chennai
and board a flight from there.

957
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,890
You should have planned
to stay a little longer, right?

958
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,840
I too want to extend my stay.

959
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,510
Well then, stay back.

960
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,790
I left my daughter back there.
And she cannot stay without me.

961
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:26,010
What is your daughter's name?

962
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:27,530
Meera.

963
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,510
-Here is her picture.
-Oh!

964
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,640
Show me.

965
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:36,720
-She is so cute.
-Here, give it to me.

966
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:40,800
Is this picture taken there?

967
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:46,010
I wanted to get photographed in
a foreign country before I die.

968
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,110
And I don't think that will happen.

969
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,280
Jaanu...

970
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:01,460
Look at him, he is hitting on
your daughter right in front of you.

971
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,210
Doesn't she look like
me from the school days?

972
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:05,590
Yeah... Yeah...

973
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,400
Everyone says the same.

974
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,800
Brother, that is why they say
to get married at the right age.

975
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,350
[scoffs] Look,he is still
staring at school kids.

976
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,320
What, he is not married yet?

977
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,800
Who would wish to get their daughter
married to a travel photographer,

978
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,680
who travels all over the world?

979
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,800
Why? Why didn't you get married?

980
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:30,010
That is...

981
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:32,180
That is...

982
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:37,350
My father is looking for
alliances to get married.

983
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:40,470
-Ram, go get the car.
-Okay...

984
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:43,730
-You guys have coffee and come.
-Okay.

985
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:44,860
I'd be waiting in the car.

986
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,380
I am asking, right?
Why didn't he married yet?

987
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,470
What is his problem?

988
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,010
-Had your coffee.
-Hmm...

989
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:56,670
-So your headache subsided?
-Hmm...

990
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,640
-I hope you have no other pains!
-Uhuh.

991
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,350
Let's go.

992
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:10,390
Hey, did I say something wrong?

993
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:12,480
Your mouth itched and did all the damage.

994
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:15,680
I am asking you something and
you are not bothered to answer me?

995
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:16,680
The thing is that...

996
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,220
All of you are staying here with
him, right? Didn't you tell him?

997
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:22,730
Well, his father...

998
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,510
Yeah, his father...

999
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:28,350
Satish, I am asking you.
Why didn't he get married yet?

1000
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,180
Hey, all three of you
are going together, right?

1001
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:36,910
Only after dropping
Jaanu, you should go home. Understood?

1002
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,890
Don't overthink. Just do as I say.

1003
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,270
Why did you take this route?

1004
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,810
Jaanu's hotel is in Hi-tech city.

1005
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:05,770
I will drop you first and then, drop her.

1006
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,030
But that will be a long route, right?

1007
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,390
Who said that?
This is a short cut.

1008
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:10,980
What?

1009
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,810
Is Panjagutta near from Gachibowli?

1010
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,580
And is Hi-tech city far?

1011
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:17,530
Well said!

1012
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:20,190
Well, shall I open Google Maps?

1013
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,420
What is the use?

1014
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:24,850
The route he takes cannot
be found on any map.

1015
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:29,730
Hey, are you serious or
just being sarcastic?

1016
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,940
-Tsk! I was serious.
-Hmm...

1017
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,270
Get down carefully.

1018
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:44,390
Careful.

1019
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,170
Go... Go... Just go...

1020
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,430
-Go. Just go...
-Ouch!

1021
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:55,080
I'm warning you, drop her
and go home straight away.

1022
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,150
-Understand?
-Ouch!

1023
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,770
Don't you have any unnecessary thoughts.

1024
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,470
I will speak a few words and... drop her.

1025
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:02,100
You know me... very well, right?

1026
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:03,990
Hmph!

1027
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:05,710
Crap!

1028
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,740
Enough of grinning! Shut up and go.

1029
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,740
Go... Go.

1030
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,200
Take care of your health.

1031
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,130
Take care. Call me as soon
as you reach Singapore.

1032
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:20,870
-I will call you soon after my delivery.
-Don't forget

1033
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:22,060
-Alright.
-Okay...

1034
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,090
-Bye.
-Bye.

1035
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,200
Bye...
[car engine starts]

1036
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:32,780
Hey...

1037
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,870
I will kill you.

1038
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:46,850
Jaanu...

1039
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,440
So you don't prefer to talk
to me if Subha is around?

1040
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,260
-Ram.
-Hmm...

1041
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,620
Why didn't you get married?

1042
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:09,310
What's the hurry?
I still have time for it.

1043
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,270
Ram, I am serious.

1044
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:15,520
Why didn't you get married yet?

1045
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,310
Just think that nobody was
ready to get married to me.

1046
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,270
Ram, I am pleading you. Tell me.

1047
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:27,380
I won't mind even if you blame me.
But just tell me why.

1048
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:29,190
I should know why you didn't get married.

1049
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,360
Will you tell me or not, Ram?
[car revvs]

1050
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:36,940
Ram...

1051
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:40,110
[honks]

1052
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:48,710
Jaanu...

1053
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,060
We are at your hotel.

1054
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,210
Are you asking me to leave?

1055
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:03,640
Well... Subha was very clear, right?

1056
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:08,390
Don't you have even the
slightest feeling of talking to me?

1057
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:09,350
No... No...

1058
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:11,930
Nothing like that.

1059
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:17,560
Tomorrow, I will pick you up from
the hotel and drop you at the airport.

1060
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:20,020
Take my number.

1061
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:39,220
"Is this all?"

1062
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:44,040
"Is this all?"

1063
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:46,980
"Won't you..."

1064
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:53,210
"...even speak a word?"

1065
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:57,980
"Is this all?"

1066
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,680
"Is this all, after all?"

1067
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:05,760
"I've come to you..."

1068
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:10,980
"...with many hopes."

1069
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:17,760
"Though the time has changed,"

1070
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:22,200
"Though the distance caved in"

1071
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:27,870
"Though the spring is
covered by the desert"

1072
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:36,440
"My heart yearned..."

1073
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,530
"...for this day"

1074
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:45,810
"And it is your silence"

1075
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:48,280
"that has won even today"

1076
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:50,030
"You'd never straight away show"

1077
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,610
"your emotions and pain"

1078
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:01,860
"that are lying hidden behind"

1079
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,260
"your heart"

1080
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,390
"How to convey or"

1081
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:13,470
"ask"

1082
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:20,370
"if you play with me"

1083
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,880
"just like my fate."

1084
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:28,360
"You are the time that I
have read the lessons"

1085
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:32,830
"You are the time that
has taught the lessons"

1086
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:37,870
"Like a lesson that can't be understood"

1087
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:42,170
"You are every moment, my dear"

1088
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,140
[dialer tone rings] Yes, Jaanu...

1089
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:52,260
Ram, did you leave?

1090
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,990
Tell me Jaanu, do you need anything?

1091
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:58,880
Where are you?

1092
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:00,810
Jaanu...

1093
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,470
Have gone far?

1094
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:18,390
Have you gone too far, Ram?

1095
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:24,620
I'm there exactly where I left you.

1096
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:07,850
Is it wrong to talk to you?

1097
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,270
And that too for seventeen years.

1098
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:13,270
[Jaanu gasps]

1099
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:30,740
Thanks.

1100
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,290
Now tell me, Jaanu.
Where do you want me to take you?

1101
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:39,690
[phone ringing]

1102
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,970
Shh! Subha is calling...

1103
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,560
Yes, Subha. Tell me.

1104
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,520
Where are you?

1105
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:49,480
I am at KBR park.

1106
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,480
Did you drop her?

1107
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:51,890
Yeah, long back.

1108
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:54,590
Did she say anything?

1109
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:56,600
Nothing...

1110
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,170
She just asked about mother and father.

1111
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,060
Meanwhile, we've reached the
hotel. I have dropped her and left.

1112
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:05,770
Oh! Alright, you go and sleep
without further thought.

1113
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,330
Okay.

1114
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,190
-I will call you early in the morning.
-Okay... Okay... Bye.

1115
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:17,710
[phone rings]
Subha.

1116
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:19,230
Take the call.

1117
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,020
Hello.

1118
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,390
-Where are you?
-I am in the room.

1119
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:27,730
What time is your flight tomorrow?

1120
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:29,270
At 5:50...

1121
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,350
So you have to go to
Chennai and leave from there?

1122
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,840
Yeah, I have to go to Chennai
and then, to Singapore.

1123
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:34,940
Alright.

1124
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:37,690
-Call me once you reach, okay?
-Hmm... Sure.

1125
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,400
At least, put a message.

1126
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,780
-Hmm...-Okay, bye.

1127
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:41,480
Bye.

1128
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:51,790
[laughs]

1129
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:58,140
Now, tell me Jaanu...
Where do you want to go?

1130
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:00,490
Let's go anywhere.

1131
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,500
You tell me.

1132
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,310
Why are you asking me? What do I know?

1133
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:07,850
Take me anywhere.

1134
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,200
I gathered some courage and asked you.

1135
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:15,890
I have no idea either.

1136
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,310
You decide, Jaanu.

1137
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,080
Shall we go to a saloon?

1138
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,450
-Saloon?
-Hmm...

1139
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,850
Once you enter Monda market,

1140
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:30,750
there is a turning to the left
and from there comes a junction.

1141
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:33,060
-Take a right from the junction.-Okay, brother...

1142
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:34,540
-Are you at the junction?-Yes.

1143
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,180
-Did you go a little further?-Yes... Yes...

1144
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:37,980
-Is there any marquee?-Yes, brother.

1145
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:38,940
There you are!

1146
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:40,940
You explained the address so
well on the phone, brother.

1147
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,190
I don't know how to
explain so well at all.

1148
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:44,130
I will call you once the work is done.

1149
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,630
Once the marriage is over,
give the money in the shop.

1150
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:47,210
Did you get it?

1151
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:48,710
Brother, someone is crying here.

1152
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:49,730
It think he is the bridegroom.

1153
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:50,960
-Why are you talking like that?-Ow...

1154
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,510
Did you get it done somewhere else?

1155
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,440
-Uhuh.-What is that, Brother?

1156
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,590
I have a bigger problem to deal
with. Disconnect the phone.

1157
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:56,960
-I know him since my childhood.-Okay, brother.

1158
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:00,020
Hey, is this the way to introduce a girl?

1159
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,520
You should tell her that I know you even
before you got your moustache and beard.

1160
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:05,670
During his childhood, his father would
ask me to trim his hair very short.

1161
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:07,190
And he would ask me to
do a nice hairstyle!

1162
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:08,730
When he was new to this place...

1163
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:13,310
he would crazily stare at
every bus that came from Vizag.

1164
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:19,770
-Okay. Tell me, dear.
-How do you want me to style him?

1165
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:25,810
Like Chiranjeevi sir or Pawan
Kaylan or Mahesh Babu or NTR?

1166
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:31,190
Give him a hair cut like
a tenth class student.

1167
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:35,440
Tenth class student?

1168
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,390
Which year?

1169
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:46,020
2002

1170
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,520
2002

1171
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:53,010
Come on...

1172
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:55,560
Is it necessary to get rid of my beard?

1173
01:27:59,360 --> 01:27:59,990
[trimmer whirrs]

1174
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:04,940
He is like a wooly mammoth. It is going
to take a lot of time. Please sit down.

1175
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:07,850
Turn this side.

1176
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:10,120
[trimmer whirring]

1177
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:18,590
[scissors snipping]

1178
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,110
You look half your age, son.

1179
01:28:28,140 --> 01:28:29,520
[blower humming]

1180
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,060
Hey, take of your hands.

1181
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,480
Okay?

1182
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:48,960
Double okay.

1183
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:50,600
You sit down as well.
I will make two plaits.

1184
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:52,400
No, I don't want.

1185
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,730
Okay, leave now.
It is time to close the shop.

1186
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,390
Jaanu, wait outside. I will come.

1187
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,940
-Who do you think she is?
-I know everything.

1188
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:06,640
What do you know?

1189
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,980
My hair did not turn grey just like that.

1190
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:11,690
No... No...

1191
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,050
-Hey...
-Hey...

1192
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,640
Hey...

1193
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:38,850
Shall we go?

1194
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,420
We will go but...

1195
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:42,320
-Before that, take that shirt off.
-Eh?

1196
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:45,390
You have a T-shirt underneath, don't you?

1197
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,110
And it's not sleeveless, right?

1198
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:49,790
So take it off...

1199
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,750
-Why Jaanu?
-Now!

1200
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,780
See, how smart you look.

1201
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:15,140
Otherwise your shirt, hair,
beard made you look like an old man.

1202
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,390
Are you a virgin?

1203
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:52,230
Are you still a virgin?

1204
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:55,020
Yuck! What are you talking, Jaanu?

1205
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:57,420
Is that true?

1206
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,440
You have changed for worse
after going to Singapore.

1207
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:00,310
Come, let's go.

1208
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:02,850
It is okay, tell me.

1209
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,830
Jaanu, let's go. It is already late.

1210
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:05,780
Whoa!

1211
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:09,610
No matter whatever I question,
you are simply escaping without answering.

1212
01:31:09,710 --> 01:31:11,140
Please leave,
otherwise my shirt will tear.

1213
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,650
Will you tell me or not?

1214
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,750
What do you want now?

1215
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:15,100
-That, you are still...
-Whoa!

1216
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:21,970
Jaanu, whatever you want to
know, I will tell you in the car.

1217
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,910
Please leave me. Please.

1218
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:25,630
Go.

1219
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:27,770
Hmph!

1220
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:50,480
So, tell me now.

1221
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:53,300
How can I not tell you now?

1222
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:55,240
Swear on God.

1223
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:58,600
One should not swear on God for
this kind of matters, Jaanu.

1224
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,290
As if I don't know you!

1225
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,500
You'd have thought something by
the time you came from there to here.

1226
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:06,060
-Jaanu,
-Swear on me!

1227
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:08,890
Tsk!

1228
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:20,290
-I am a virgin.
-Huh?

1229
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,780
-I am a virgin.
-[gasps]

1230
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,730
Listen...

1231
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,980
I've told you as you've insisted me.

1232
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,980
So please leave this topic here. Please...

1233
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:31,060
Why?

1234
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:33,980
I made a vow to Lord
hanuman. First, you get into the car.

1235
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:37,770
How?

1236
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,990
-What is it now?
-Uhuh! No dearth of ego.

1237
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:44,060
You have grown up like a
buffalo. What's your age now?

1238
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:46,000
Please leave this topic.

1239
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:49,080
I feel very embarrassed when
you are asking me several times.

1240
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,230
Well... Didn't you love
anyone in all these years?

1241
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:03,140
-Who told you that I never loved anyone?
-That is what...

1242
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:06,000
You will slowly let me know.

1243
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:10,730
What?
-Girls go crazy for guys like you!

1244
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:13,230
How did they miss you?

1245
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:16,270
What do you mean by "guys like me"?

1246
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:20,770
You are so handsome that
any girl can go crazy for you.

1247
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,100
Why? Didn't anyone ever
mention that to you?

1248
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:27,760
-Come on, Jaanu!
-Oh... Oh... Ooh!

1249
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:29,820
Enough of your blushing. Tell me.

1250
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:35,730
-Chaaru.
-Full name?

1251
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,060
Charumati.

1252
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,430
She was my junior in college.

1253
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,780
Very nice girl.
She was very beautiful.

1254
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:43,540
She never told me
anything while in college.

1255
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,140
One fine day, she called me
suddenly and said she wants to talk to me.

1256
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,050
I asked her what's the matter.

1257
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,980
She said that their parents were
looking for a marriage alliance for her.

1258
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,360
I congratulated her.

1259
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,600
She got annoyed.

1260
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:56,770
She told me that her parents would
talk to my parents, if I was okay.

1261
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,730
What did you answer her?

1262
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,400
What will I say?

1263
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,880
-As I didn't understand what she said...
-Tell me what she said.

1264
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:06,640
-I told her I wasn't settled, no job etc.
-What did she reply?

1265
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,770
-She didn't hear me out.
-Then?

1266
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:11,890
I realized she wasn't giving up on me,
so I told her the truth.

1267
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,600
-What truth?
-I told her about you.

1268
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,140
She was quiet for some
time and then hung up.

1269
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:22,190
She has sent me a wedding
card three months later.

1270
01:34:22,850 --> 01:34:24,520
She called me asked me to
forget what had happened.

1271
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,300
And wanted me to come for
her marriage without fail.

1272
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:30,190
Did you go?

1273
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:32,520
How will I go, Jaanu?

1274
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:34,950
Whatever it is...

1275
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:37,810
She was interested in me.

1276
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:41,480
She would feel awkward if I
go there. So, I didn't attend.

1277
01:34:53,130 --> 01:34:56,270
I just couldn't understand why you have
left without informing me on that day

1278
01:34:57,140 --> 01:35:01,440
and why you didn't come back for me.

1279
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:08,190
I didn't know whom to ask.
Neither did I forget you.

1280
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:18,060
I lost interest in my studies. And I've
passed Intermediate with great difficulty.

1281
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,310
I've studied well in my graduation out of
fear that my parents would get me married.

1282
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:27,990
Whenever I meet our school friends,

1283
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,350
I used to very eagerly listen to them
hoping that they would talk about you.

1284
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:41,980
If someone looked like you,

1285
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:47,020
I used run after them searching for you.

1286
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,060
But when I knew it wasn't you...

1287
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,850
Moreover,
as if we are having dearth of problems,

1288
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:02,250
my elder sister eloped and got married.

1289
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:07,730
And three months later,
my parents have fixed my alliance.

1290
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:12,130
Watching my father agitation on my sister,

1291
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:15,250
I couldn't object him.

1292
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:18,530
Anyhow, what can I say?

1293
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,860
That I loved a guy in the tenth standard

1294
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:23,950
and have absolutely no
clue about his whereabouts?

1295
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:35,920
I was so unsure even on
the day of my marriage.

1296
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:43,100
I was sure that you would
come back looking for me.

1297
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:50,230
It might seems surreal,

1298
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:53,390
but even when I was getting married,

1299
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:58,150
I felt that you were somewhere
standing in that wedding venue.

1300
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:03,820
I have eagerly waited with the
belief that you'd dramatically appear...

1301
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:09,730
...just before tying the wedding knot
and scream "Give me back my Jaanu",

1302
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:12,420
just like in movies.

1303
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:19,410
But it didn't happen in that way.

1304
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:22,080
[sniffles] I got married anyway.

1305
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:31,020
My heart broke.

1306
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:40,270
Even to this day,

1307
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:43,160
whenever I feel low,

1308
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:48,550
the person who instantly comes to my mind
is K Ramachandra Mohan of tenth standard.

1309
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,170
[weeps]

1310
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,710
What is it?

1311
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:06,200
Sir...

1312
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:11,560
It is getting late.
I have to lock the gate.

1313
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:16,630
I will lock it if you move the vehicle.

1314
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:47,030
Ram, I wanted to tell you this
whenever I get a chance to meet you.

1315
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:51,190
With whom can I confess my feelings?

1316
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,210
And that is why...

1317
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:57,090
But I don't want to hold you at fault.

1318
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,100
Ram...

1319
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:11,350
Which means...
You never knew that I came to your college

1320
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:17,020
and wrote on chit that I want to meet you.

1321
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,740
Don't you know anything about this?

1322
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:24,200
When did you come?

1323
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:27,290
I came to meet you, Jaanu.

1324
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,530
What are you talking about, Ram?

1325
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:38,630
Re... Did you really come?

1326
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:43,450
[birds chirping] [water rustling]

1327
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,620
Sister, can you spare a minute?

1328
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:02,240
Hey, ask her.

1329
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:03,480
Err... It is...

1330
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:06,920
Can you please call Jaanu... Janaki Devi
from second-year B.Sc Computer science?

1331
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:07,810
I just have to talk to her.

1332
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:10,840
-Is it a 'love matter'?
-No! It is not what you think, sister.

1333
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:14,620
They love each other since school days.
There has been some gap in-between.

1334
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:17,340
We need your help since it's a women's
college. Otherwise, we could have gone.

1335
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,990
We came all the way from Hyderabad.
It is more than enough if you inform her.

1336
01:40:21,230 --> 01:40:23,160
You guys came all the way
from Hyderabad for this?

1337
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:24,010
Yes, sister!

1338
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:28,580
I feel like I can be empathetic
towards you guys. Well, I will help you.

1339
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:30,350
-But I won't get into any problem, right?
-No... No...

1340
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,870
You won't get into any problem, sister.

1341
01:40:31,970 --> 01:40:34,950
We just have to meet
and talk to her. Please.

1342
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:37,090
What is her name?

1343
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,030
S. Janaki Devi. Can you
give me your book once?

1344
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:42,200
Pen...

1345
01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:48,730
Hey... Write her father's name too,
just to be on the safe side.

1346
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:50,620
Suppose, if we're having a bad time,

1347
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,270
and if there are some other girls with
the same name, it will become a mess.

1348
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:01,520
-You go.
-Okay.

1349
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:04,720
-What is your name?
-K Ramachandra.

1350
01:41:04,820 --> 01:41:05,810
Ramachandra...

1351
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,100
Where are you going?

1352
01:41:31,790 --> 01:41:34,320
-S Janaki Devi?
-Ahh, that's me...

1353
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,230
His name?

1354
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:41,780
A boy is waiting outside to meet you.

1355
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:48,960
What is this?
Are you a messenger of love?

1356
01:41:49,790 --> 01:41:51,690
And is this why you attend college?

1357
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:55,780
Let me know if you don't like to study. I
will ask the principal to give you the TC.

1358
01:41:59,210 --> 01:42:04,820
Hey, I will slap you if you ever
do this messenger service.

1359
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:14,810
I don't know why...
but she has scolded me upon seeing you.

1360
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:23,980
I guess it is better
you speak to her directly.

1361
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:32,070
Can you just do another small help?

1362
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,160
Hmm...

1363
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,180
Tell her that I will
never bother her again.

1364
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:37,340
Come, let's go.

1365
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,620
Hey, don't be hasty.

1366
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:41,940
Let her come out,
we will speak to her directly.

1367
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:46,200
No, dude. It has been three years.
Anything could have happened?

1368
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:48,860
It is better not to trouble her any more.

1369
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:50,570
-Let us go.
-Did we come all the way here for this?

1370
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:00,340
-Sorry, I didn't even ask your name.
-Vasanti.

1371
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:01,640
Thanks, Vasanti.

1372

1379
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:06,540
-Jaanu?-Don't come in.

1380
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:07,830
Don't worry, I am right outside.

1381
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:11,630
-Jaanu, are you alright?-I didn't see you.

1382
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:16,610
I didn't see you that day, Ram.

1383
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:18,750
-[tapping sound] [weeping]
-Jaanu

-Jaanu...
-[sobs]

1385
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:27,440
I didn't know you were there
that day. I didn't see you.

1386
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:34,700
I didn't see you that day.
I didn't know you were there that day.

1387
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,560
I don't know... I don't know...

1388
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:43,700
I didn't see you that day,
Ram. I didn't see you.

1389
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:53,440
-S Janaki Devi?
-Yes, that's me.

1390
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,530
Ahh, his name is...

1391
01:44:57,710 --> 01:45:00,680
There is a boy
waiting outside to meet you.

1392
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:32,210
What is this?
Are you a messenger of love?

1393
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:34,960
Is this why you attend college?

1394
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:39,070
Let me know if you don't like to study, I
will ask the Principal to give you the TC.

1395
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:47,530
Hey, I will slap you if you ever
do this messenger service again.

1396
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:13,380
If we are not destined to be together,
then why should we even meet again?

1397
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,050
Poor you...
You are like this because of me.

1398
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:24,010
But how could I believe
that you didn't like me!

1399
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,300
Damn! That was a hasty decision.

1400
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:31,900
I should have waited until I met you.

1401
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:35,860
If that girl had mentioned
your name on that day...

1402
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,640
I am ill-fated!

1403
01:46:44,730 --> 01:46:46,280
Why should we know this truth now?

1404
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,940
We would have lived our life...

1405
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:54,740
...believing the lie that we
believed all through, to be true.

1406
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:57,190
But,

1407
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:04,140
to know that you loved
me and came back for me

1408
01:47:06,290 --> 01:47:08,070
is a bit of pacifying my grief.

1409
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:16,820
[cicadas critter]

1410
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:21,280
What made you realize all of
a sudden after three years

1411
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:24,880
which you couldn't do tell
me when I was beside you?

1412
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,630
I tried to tell you several times.

1413
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,980
But something or the
other held me back.

1414
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:32,160
I don't have good looks like you.

1415
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:35,280
I can't even sing like you.

1416
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:37,340
I didn't know how to express.

1417
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,050
I don't know you...

1418
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:44,610
But on that day, I felt like I
would die if I didn't tell you.

1419
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:49,090
I've got a lot of courage on that
day, which I usually don't have.

1420
01:47:49,930 --> 01:47:51,660
I have immediately come to your college.

1421
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:56,210
How did you know that I
was studying in that college?

1422
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,430
Crazy woman!
What kind of a question is that?

1423
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:01,520
I get to know everything about you.

1424
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,660
[smiles]

1425
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:06,770
Yeah, but how did you know?
You used to stay in Hyderabad, right?

1426
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:09,730
I've appointed a person to get
to know everything about you.

1427
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:13,130
I would get an update of any information
about whatever happens in your life.

1428
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:16,790
Whenever I wanted to see you,
I immediately came to Vizag and

1429
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:22,050
used to secretly follow you
from college to your home.

1430
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:26,240
If I was in close
proximity, I used to hide.

1431
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:32,030
Just that day... Tsk! I couldn't realise
that you were scolding another guy.

1432
01:48:32,990 --> 01:48:34,620
Apart from this,
I know everything else about you.

1433
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:37,680
Tell me what do you know about me.

1434
01:48:37,780 --> 01:48:39,860
-It is...
-If you tell me anything wrong...

1435
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:43,210
You've scored 482 marks in tenth
class and 364 marks in intermediate.

1436
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:45,150
On my birthday, you wore the dress
that you bought on your birthday.

1437
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:46,820
You favourite God is Lord Venkateshwara.

1438
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:49,070
You've stopped singing
after I left the town.

1439
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,640
You wanted to study Telugu literature...

1440
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:52,650
...but your father has joined you
in B.Sc Computer Science branch.

1441
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:54,470
Because of which you didn't
have your food for two days.

1442
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:55,800
And even your father had
no clue about this incident.

1443
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:57,420
-Huh...
-Err...

1444
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,280
I meant, I know about this incident
which even your father doesn't.

1445
01:49:01,590 --> 01:49:02,980
-I am sorry.
-[chuckles]

1446
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:04,630
Hmm...

1447
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,820
You got Jaundice in 2006
and Typhoid in 2007.

1448
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,440
You've got both of these diseases
exactly during your exams time.

1449
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:13,230
And after that, a curly-haired guy
named Pradeep used to follow you.

1450
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,940
And someone bashed him very badly.

1451
01:49:15,130 --> 01:49:17,280
He got admitted in the hospital
and a police case was filed as well.

1452
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:18,330
And it was me who has bashed him.

1453
01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:19,430
[gasps]

1454
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:21,180
Hmm...

1455
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:22,470
Phew!

1456
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:35,700
Apart from me, there were three other guys
who were in love with you at that time.

1457
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,980
You wore a saree for the first
time on your college annual day.

1458
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:41,850
It was a blue saree.

1459
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:46,970
On one hand, you were scared
about your saree falling apart...

1460
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,540
and on the other hand, you were
shy that everyone was staring at you.

1461
01:49:52,650 --> 01:49:54,110
Do you know how
beautiful you looked on that day?

1462
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:57,660
Hmph!

1463
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:05,050
[laughs]

1464
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:06,870
Do it again.

1465
01:50:10,230 --> 01:50:13,780
[laughs]

1466
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:23,680
And after that, I saw you in
a saree on your wedding day.

1467
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:33,180
It was a yellow saree.

1468
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:40,200
Just as you felt my presence...

1469
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:44,340
I was indeed there at your wedding.

1470
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:53,860
I saw you from a corner
standing in the crowd.

1471
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:57,000
I wasn't there until the time the
Mangala Sutra (holy thread) was tied.

1472
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:06,060
The crowd, the hustle...

1473
01:51:08,450 --> 01:51:14,430
I went as far as I could.

1474
01:51:15,930 --> 01:51:16,890
Ram...

1475
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:17,600
[door bell dings]

1476
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:20,270
Coffee?

1477
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:24,940
[weeps]

1478
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:28,080
Sorry sir, for being late.

1479
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:29,180
Don't be,
you've come at the right time.

1480
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:33,010
-Shall I pour, sir?
-It's okay.

1481
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:34,420
-Thank you, sir!
-Hmm...

1482
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:51,530
Well, I shall leave now.
Have a good night sleep.

1483
01:51:51,630 --> 01:51:52,430
I will come at 3:30 am...

1484
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:53,450
-...and call you from the lobby.
-Come here.

1485
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,920
-Get ready...
-I have to tell you something.

1486
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,320
-It's okay, tell me from there.
-Tsk! Just come, sit here.

1487
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:20,040
It took seventeen years to see your face.

1488
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:23,550
And that too just this night.

1489
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:27,830
I must thank God for this.

1490
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,750
But I will be thankful to him tomorrow.

1491
01:52:32,150 --> 01:52:37,320
But today, don't give me useless
advises such as get rest, sleep etc.

1492
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,560
I want to be with you,

1493
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,570
and talk several matters.

1494
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:43,270
That's about it.

1495
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:44,830
Understood?

1496
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:46,070
Okay?

1497
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:16,380
"My life..."

1498
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:22,040

"the story of full moon day."

"While a no moon day tells the story"

1512
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:22,480
"of the time when we were apart"

Oh my God! I'm doomed!

1524
01:56:29,410 --> 01:56:30,240
What happened?

1525
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:32,200
They are my students.

1526
01:56:38,530 --> 01:56:39,600
So what?

1527
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:44,630
Don't you get it? I'll be doomed if
they see me with you at this time.

1528
01:56:46,490 --> 01:56:48,840
By any chance, are they
looking here? Look... Look...

1529
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:52,760
Look.

1530
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:58,770
No, they are leaving.

1531

[sighs]

1532
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,830
But they'll have to pass
from here to go out.

1533
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:06,700
Yes, you are right. Well,
I will go and hide in the bathroom.

1534
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:09,230
Call me once they leave.
Okay? Please... Please...

[gasps]

1536
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:17,510
-Sir this is the kitchen.
-Where is the bathroom?

1537
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:19,130
That way, sir.

1538
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:22,760
All of you have come. I am very happy!

1539
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:23,940
Yeah... Yeah...

1540
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:27,300
Hi.

1541
01:57:29,010 --> 01:57:30,540
-Sir...
-Yes.

1542
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:32,890
Your new look is awesome.

1543
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:35,300
I could not recognise you
at all from a distance.

1544
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:37,380
I thought it was some young boy.

1545
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:39,920
Well, what are you
doing here at this time?

1546
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:40,870
It is Abhi's birthday, sir.

1547
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:41,770
Oh! Happy birthday.

1548
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:43,820
We are here to make her
do the cake cutting at 12.

1549
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:45,090
-Thank you, sir!
-You are leaving, right?

1550
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:45,930
-Okay, go...
-Sure...

1551
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:46,540
Okay?

1552
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:48,760
Go, go... It's too late.

1553
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:51,590
Sir, is she your wife?

1554
01:57:58,510 --> 01:57:59,360
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

1555
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:00,640
We are Ram sir's students.

1556
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:02,930
Yeah I know, he told me...

1557
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:04,090
Just now.

1558
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:05,380
Okay.

1559
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:07,260
Actually, we have no clue
that sir is already married.

1560
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:08,700
-Huh?
-He never told us.

1561
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:09,800
No, Janu... No...

1562
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:18,410
Actually, ours is a love marriage.
So we did not tell this to anyone.

1563
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:20,000
Love marriage?

1564
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,430
Hmm... Why are you startled?

1565
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:24,630
We cannot digest the fact
that sir is already married.

1566
01:58:24,830 --> 01:58:26,630
And on the top of that,
a "love marriage" is unbelievable

1567
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:28,850
Why did you make such a statement?

1568
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:31,300
Of course...
Do you know how strict sir is?

1569
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:32,570
We are not allowed gaze here and there,

1570
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:34,820
talk to new people and...
-Alright... Alright...

1571
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:36,820
Enough of your complaints. Now, go home.

1572
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,280
Why are you threatening
them? Come, sit down.

1573
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:59,380
See, ma'am... how he is
behaving even when you are there...

1574
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:01,100
No problem, tell me.

1575
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:02,560
Where did I stop?

1576
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:04,450
"Not allowed to talk, giggle..."

1577
01:59:04,620 --> 01:59:07,460
Yeah, and we're aren't even
allowed to wear sleeveless.

1578
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:10,080
My father is much better than him, ma'am.

1579
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:12,300
He's been like this since his childhood.

1580
01:59:12,590 --> 01:59:15,340
From now on, I will teach him
how to behave with girls. Okay?

1581
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:15,930
Okay.

1582
01:59:16,050 --> 01:59:18,550
But ma'am, how did sir fall in love?

1583
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:20,340
Err... [chuckles]

1584
01:59:21,630 --> 01:59:24,630
Ours is a 'school days' love.

1585
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:26,180
Since tenth division.

1586
01:59:26,230 --> 01:59:27,470
Since school days?

1587
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:28,390
Hmm...

1588
01:59:29,730 --> 01:59:31,260
Who was the first one to propose, ma'am?

1589
01:59:39,050 --> 01:59:40,720
What, sir? Are you feeling shy?

1590
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:46,430
When did you accept sir's love, ma'am?

1591
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:48,260
The very same day... The very moment.

1592
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:50,070
At once.

1593
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:52,260
Why did you accept it instantly, ma'am?

1594
01:59:52,510 --> 01:59:53,520
The way you look,

1595
01:59:53,580 --> 01:59:55,510
you should have made him come
behind you for at least a week.

1596
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:58,970
And when it comes to a person like sir,
it is not a mistake even if it is a month.

1597
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:03,010
But at that time, he was my everything...

1598
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:04,020
Even now.

1599
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:10,760
Please ma'am, can you tell
me how sir proposed you?

1600
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:13,730
[chuckles]

1601
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:15,260
We won't ask anymore questions.

1602
02:00:18,680 --> 02:00:20,300
It is my birthday wish. Please...

1603
02:00:21,970 --> 02:00:24,130
Our tenth class went very happily.

1604
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,430
I was a very joyful girl.

1605
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:35,680
But... one day Ram left to
Hyderabad without telling me.

1606
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:41,170
After that, the smile on my face vanished.

1607
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:44,840
Then I joined college but...

1608
02:00:46,470 --> 02:00:48,090
I could never forget him.

1609
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:54,720
I used to feel very terrible.

1610
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:59,190
But deep down inside,

1611
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:03,990
I knew Ram would come back one day.

1612
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:06,800
He would come back for me.

1613
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:10,180
Sometimes, our heart would
know it in advance that

1614
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:14,480
something is about to happen
though nothing is happening in life.

1615
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:17,090
And on that day, I exactly felt the same.

1616
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:22,490
[splash]

1617
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:25,880
[tyres screech]

1618
02:01:37,160 --> 02:01:37,900
Excuse me...

1619
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:42,900
Can you call S. Janaki Devi of the
second year in Computer Science?

1620
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:43,610
I have to talk to her.

1621
02:01:43,710 --> 02:01:44,840
Is it a love matter?

1622
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:47,230
-Yes.
-I hope I won't get into a problem.

1623
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:49,590
-What is your name?
-Vasanti.

1624
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:51,720
Look Vasanti,
you don't have to worry at all.

1625
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:55,090
You just have to go to S. Janaki Devi
of B.Sc second-year computer science,

1626
02:01:55,290 --> 02:01:57,180
and tell her that K. Ramachandra
has come to meet her.

1627
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:57,760
Hmm...

1628
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,720
Vasanti, thanks.

1629
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:08,510
S. Janaki Devi...

1630
02:02:08,950 --> 02:02:09,880
Yes, that's me.

1631
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:13,630
A boy named K. Ramachandra
is waiting for you outside.

1632
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:16,400
And the events that
had happened after that

1633
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:20,770
are those which I've been waiting for them
to happen all these days in my dreams.

1634
02:02:21,570 --> 02:02:23,630
My Ram has come searching for me.

1635
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,470
My world changed in that very moment.

1636
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:30,700
K. Ramachandra.

1637
02:02:34,090 --> 02:02:35,930
I couldn't put a step forward.

1638
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:41,260
The moment I heard that name I went numb.

1639
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:43,340
Yet I ran.

1640
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:50,460
"So many..."

1641
02:02:51,870 --> 02:02:56,260
"confusions..."

1642
02:02:57,930 --> 02:03:02,650
"The day without tears..."

1643
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:07,970
"is atlast here"

1644
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:14,540
"In my life..."

1645
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:21,610
"for his love"

1646
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:26,550
I saw him after three years.

1647
02:03:28,930 --> 02:03:31,630
The face that I saw during
school, got completely changed.

1648
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:34,380
He looked like a lion with
his moustache and beard.

1649
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,210
For me...

1650
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:47,590
For Jaanu...

1651
02:03:56,590 --> 02:04:00,010
I wanted to question him
hard upon seeing him but...

1652
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:05,870
Jaanu...

1653
02:04:26,010 --> 02:04:30,980
"Dreams and imaginations
don't seem to go away"

1654
02:04:31,180 --> 02:04:36,050
"As life in the heart blossoms."

1655
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:40,730
"But when those dreams
and imaginations forget you"

1656
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:45,220
"Is the time when the
breath leaves me too."

1657
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:48,440
Well... Enough of listening
to stories. Go, go home.

1658
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:50,350
Come...

1659
02:04:54,430 --> 02:04:55,470
Hey, you come here.

1660
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:58,050
Can't you do the cake cutting at home?

1661
02:04:58,220 --> 02:05:00,050
Do you have to do it at midnight out here?

1662
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:02,420
Message me once everyone
reaches home. Okay?

1663
02:05:02,590 --> 02:05:03,330
-Okay, sir.
-Go.

1664
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:04,460
You look good together, sir.

1665
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:06,170
I'll hit you on your head! Go!

1666
02:05:08,510 --> 02:05:10,730
Hello, should I tell you specifically?

1667
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:20,510
-Good night, sir.
-Good night. Take care

1668
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,510
Shall we leave?

1669
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:39,650
Where shall go next?

1670
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:46,670
If you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

1671
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:50,090
Oh! I am scared.

1672
02:05:51,470 --> 02:05:52,290
Tell me what it is.

1673
02:05:52,730 --> 02:05:55,590
Well... The hotel is far off.

1674
02:05:55,790 --> 02:05:56,720
So?

1675
02:05:57,710 --> 02:06:00,510
-Nothing. Come, let's go.
-Tell me.

1676
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:04,570
The hotel is far off...

1677
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:09,930
...and my home is nearby.

1678
02:06:12,010 --> 02:06:14,260
-You...
-What do you think of me, Ram?

1679
02:06:15,550 --> 02:06:19,510
Oh no! Sorry... Sorry...
I didn't mean it that way.

1680
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:21,290
That's why I didn't want to tell you.

1681
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:23,580
Well, I will book a cab
and we will go to the hotel.

1682
02:06:24,010 --> 02:06:27,090
What is the name of the lady who tried
to seduce Sage Vishwamitra by dancing?

1683
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:31,700
Menaka...

1684
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:35,260
Right... And who are the other two?

1685
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:37,650
Rambha and Urvasi.

1686
02:06:38,590 --> 02:06:42,130
Even if those three ladies are left in
your house at night, in their usual attire

1687
02:06:42,190 --> 02:06:43,940
we need not worry at all.

1688
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:46,540
Moreover, you would take
care of them like a warden.

1689
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:47,740
[sighs]

1690
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:51,130
[smiles]

1691
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:54,560
You are feeling that way because
I've trimmed my moustache or beard.

1692
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:56,560
Oh! Otherwise?

1693
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:00,020
You'd feel the same even then.

1694
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:01,420
[chuckles]

1695
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:03,180
Where is your house? Let's go.

1696
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:05,800
[thunder rumbles]

1697
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:21,350
So Ram, do you have girls
living in your neighbourhood?

1698
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:22,220
Yes.

1699
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:24,680
Crazy you!

1700
02:07:26,990 --> 02:07:27,840
-Step in with your right foot.
-[gasps]

1701
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:29,720
You...

1702
02:07:48,490 --> 02:07:50,510
So this is K. Ramachandra's house.

1703
02:07:53,470 --> 02:07:56,430
-Hey, the floor will get wet.
-It is okay. No problem.

1704
02:07:59,050 --> 02:08:00,170
Your house looks very good.

1705
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:04,180
-Where is the bathroom?
-Here, on the right side.

1706
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:08,300
You go. I will get you a towel.

1707
02:08:11,290 --> 02:08:17,250
[shower running]

1708
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:25,760
Jaanu, I kept a new soap and a
fresh towel here, and leaving.

1709
02:08:26,010 --> 02:08:27,140
There is a soap in here already!

1710
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:28,640
Hey, that's my soap, Jaanu.

1711
02:08:28,990 --> 02:08:31,160
Why? Do you have Psoriasis
or something of that kind?

1712
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:32,450
No... I don't have anything of such kind.

1713
02:08:34,010 --> 02:08:35,110
Can you put these clothes to dry?

1714
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:42,130
Take the soap and towel.

1715
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:01,260
[sniffs]

1716
02:09:15,670 --> 02:09:16,220
Jaanu...

1717
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:22,510
Ram, I will be talking
and you just listen.

1718
02:09:23,770 --> 02:09:26,780
You cannot go on like this. Get married.

1719
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,680
You should have a family of yours.

1720
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:33,240
I have to see your kids
and give them love.

1721
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:38,930
I have to see whether their
eyes and nose resemble you.

1722
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:46,010
I should be the one to
know your wife first.

1723
02:09:46,830 --> 02:09:49,690
I should meet and insist her
to take good care of you...

1724
02:09:49,890 --> 02:09:51,850
...as no one would be as
lucky as her to have you.

1725
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:57,190
I will definitely tell her.

1726
02:09:57,390 --> 02:10:03,300
[indistinct aeroplane whizzing]

1727
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:08,740
Do you want to eat something?

1728
02:10:12,590 --> 02:10:14,140
You didn't eat
anything at the hotel either.

1729
02:10:16,110 --> 02:10:17,210
Should I order some food on the phone?

1730
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:18,210
I am not hungry.

1731
02:10:20,650 --> 02:10:21,540
But I am hungry.

1732
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,010
Is it okay?

1733
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:42,260
Hmm... It is just like
how my mother cooks.

1734
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:53,970
Jaanu...

1735
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:55,170
Hmm...

1736
02:10:57,580 --> 02:10:58,590
Are you happy?

1737
02:10:58,820 --> 02:11:01,440
Hmm... Yes, after a long time.

1738
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:04,510
Hey 'loose',
I didn't mean about this moment.

1739
02:11:05,050 --> 02:11:06,930
I meant are you happy in your life.

1740
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:10,590
What's with you? You are asking
me like how my mother does.

1741
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:14,050
It's alright if you don't like to tell me.

1742
02:11:19,300 --> 02:11:20,930
It used to be very difficult initially.

1743
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:25,610
I was alone in Singapore
and didn't know what to do.

1744
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:29,050
I used to sob a lot profusely
standing in front of God.

1745
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,470
But he is a very good person.

1746
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:35,280
He is a good father to my daughter.

1747
02:11:35,550 --> 02:11:38,010
He understands without
me telling him anything.

1748
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:40,000
I have no dearth of anything.

1749
02:11:46,630 --> 02:11:49,320
If you ask me whether I am happy or not,

1750
02:11:53,630 --> 02:11:55,470
I can say that I am at peace.

1751
02:11:58,340 --> 02:11:58,970
Okay.

1752
02:12:00,930 --> 02:12:03,010
But I want to say something to you now.

1753
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:04,130
But I won't.

1754
02:12:04,680 --> 02:12:05,680
No, don't tell me.

1755
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:07,940
[Jaanu laughs]

1756
02:12:08,290 --> 02:12:11,640
Oh! Sit right here
Jaanu, I will get a lamp.

1757
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:23,200
"On the banks of Yamuna"

1758
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:27,070
"Goddess Radha awaits for the dark hero"

1759
02:12:27,370 --> 02:12:31,100
"The love swells, the golden moonlight..."

1760
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:35,140
"haven't they withered..."
[things clattering]

1761
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:39,600
"The night has passed,"
[things clattering continues]

1762
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:43,800
"the day has passed Lord
Krishna hasn't arrived..."

1763
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,200
"The romantic prince hasn't arrived"

1764
02:12:47,420 --> 02:12:51,050
"Is there no musical connection?"

1765
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:55,880
"During the time when
Krishna is not around"

1766
02:12:59,130 --> 02:13:04,470
"Radha feels immense agony in her heart"

1767
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:10,180
"During the time when
Krishna is not around"

1768
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:13,930
"Radha feels immense agony in her heart"

1769
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:17,800
"Poor Radha..."

1770
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:23,140
[indistinct thunder rumbles]
[indistinct rain dripping]

1771
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:33,550
-What are these things?
-Memories.

1772
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:36,430
It's smell is still intact from that time.

1773
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:39,130
How did you keep all these
things so intact all these days?

1774
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:54,750
Ah!

1775
02:13:59,010 --> 02:13:59,630
This is yours.

1776
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:03,250
How did you get this?

1777
02:14:03,350 --> 02:14:06,880
Oh! It grew legs and came to me running!

1778
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:09,800
What did you think? I stole it,
as a token of your remembrance.

1779
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:11,680
That's is what I'm asking,
how did you do that?

1780
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:14,180
You used to leave your dupatta in
the class every time you went for P.T.

1781
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:15,220
-Do you remember this?
-Hmm...

1782
02:14:16,190 --> 02:14:18,630
I've followed you for a long time and
then snatched it at the right time.

1783
02:14:18,830 --> 02:14:19,830
[laughs]

1784
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:31,960
Oh...

1785
02:14:32,060 --> 02:14:33,220
Careful... Careful...

1786
02:14:43,790 --> 02:14:44,270
Oh!

1787
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:46,680
-What is that?
-Nothing.

1788
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:48,760
-Is it a love letter?
-No... No...

1789
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:49,920
Is it a poem?

1790
02:14:50,830 --> 02:14:51,770
-Hmm...
-[gasps]

1791
02:14:51,870 --> 02:14:53,420
Is it about me? Oh you...

1792
02:14:54,010 --> 02:14:54,760
Give it to me.

1793
02:14:55,050 --> 02:14:58,090
No, Jaanu. I will blush if you read this.

1794
02:14:58,290 --> 02:15:02,680
Hey... Hey... Hey...
Who else will write about me except you?

1795
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:04,880
Well... You read it out
while I will listen to it.

1796
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:07,620
-Read it out...
-Jaanu...

1797
02:15:10,580 --> 02:15:11,440
Come on, read it.

1798
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:23,150
'You are the rising wave
and I am the shore waiting for you,'

1799
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:27,840
'Like the water lily
waiting for the moon,'

1800
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:31,380
'Like the black clouds
waiting for the breeze,'

1801
02:15:32,840 --> 02:15:35,970
'To get a glimpse of your
eyes, your vibrant smile.'

1802
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:38,800
'My heart kept counting
the stars all night.'

1803
02:15:39,130 --> 02:15:41,130
'Can't you lend me a look?'

1804
02:15:41,830 --> 02:15:44,130
'and say those magical words in my ear?'

1805
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:46,700
'If you accept I will
accompany your shadow.'

1806
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:49,720
'If you give me a boon,
I am ever behind your every step.'

1807
02:15:51,570 --> 02:15:54,830
'If you belong to the mother who
had you for ten months in her womb,'

1808
02:15:55,030 --> 02:16:00,510
'Then you belong to me too, for having
you all these years in my heart.'

1809
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:02,890
[knuckles pop]

1810
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:36,150
Ram...

1811
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:40,250
Jaanu... didn't you asleep?

1812
02:17:41,260 --> 02:17:42,130
Come up, here.

1813
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:47,550
-It's fine, I'll sleep on the floor.
-Just come up here.

1814
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:25,940
Give me your details like
email id, height, weight etc.

1815
02:18:27,940 --> 02:18:28,820
Why?

1816
02:18:29,230 --> 02:18:30,690
To find a girl for you.

1817
02:18:31,380 --> 02:18:33,380
-That's not necessary.
-Why?

1818
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:38,340
How can I marry someone after having
loved a person like S. Janaki Devi?

1819
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:39,170
Aah!

1820
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:43,300
Didn't I get married to R. Shiva Shankar
after being in love with K. Ramachandra?

1821
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:44,780
Tell me your details first.

1822
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:55,930
'postbox86@gmail.com'

1823
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:01,210
Is it time to leave?

1824
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:05,720
Fifteen more minutes to go.

1825
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:13,930
Your student told me
something at the restaurant.

1826
02:19:14,590 --> 02:19:18,400
Yes, I was about to ask that.
What did she whisper in your ear?

1827
02:19:22,470 --> 02:19:25,380
She said, "Sir is a very good
person, take care of him."

1828
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:32,400
I already know that
'Sir' is a good person.

1829
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:35,740
But I'm unable to
understand how to take care of him.

1830
02:19:40,960 --> 02:19:41,870
Shall we start?

1831
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:03,320
[bike arrives]

1832
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:21,790
"The bird is leaving the branch..."

1833
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:27,130
"The flower is shedding tears"

1834
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:33,930
"Like a baby leaving its mother's lap."

1835
02:20:34,870 --> 02:20:39,510
"And a heart drenched
in a relentless wail"

1836
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:46,000
"Just after the summer
holidays in a school"

1837
02:20:46,430 --> 02:20:52,220
"You will have to come back"

1838
02:20:52,930 --> 02:20:58,490
"Our dreams
materialised just for an evening"

1839
02:20:58,890 --> 02:21:04,000
"Wonder how the days
to come shall pass by"

1840
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:09,720
"My life is the past with
your sweet memories"

1841
02:21:12,430 --> 02:21:17,130
"The eye is losing its vision"

1842
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:23,220
"Who will wipe the tears of mine?"

1843
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:05,590
"All those smiles are leaving me"

1844
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:11,720
"Looking for that part of
me that doesn't leave you"

1845
02:22:12,040 --> 02:22:17,680
"Little hopes make me live now"

1846
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:23,950
"Our talks are drifting
apart unable to pair up"

1847
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:29,810
"The fate that has split us apart"

1848
02:22:30,010 --> 02:22:35,780
"That fate, I shall
defeat and win you over"

1849
02:22:36,050 --> 02:22:40,630
"in my next birth"

1850
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:46,760
Thank you, ma'am.

1851
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:48,550
Hope you had a pleasant stay.

1852
02:22:56,590 --> 02:23:02,470
"Even if we part and move
in different directions."

1853
02:23:02,570 --> 02:23:08,470
"Even if one tune land in two ways."

1854
02:23:08,510 --> 02:23:14,450
"Will I ever look any
which way other than you?"

1855
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:20,530
"All my steps lead to you alone"

1856
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:26,470
"My surge of memories
asked about you repeatedly"

1857
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:32,530
"The eternal memories
keep feeling my thoughts"

1858
02:23:32,690 --> 02:23:38,610
"to write poems for
you again and again"

1859
02:24:18,470 --> 02:24:19,130
What?

1860
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:23,930
I want to stay with you
for some more time, Ram.

1861
02:24:25,850 --> 02:24:27,340
It is already late, Jaanu.

1862
02:24:28,330 --> 02:24:29,370
Please, Ram...

1863
02:24:39,630 --> 02:24:40,650
Don't look at me that way.

Where are you going?

1868
02:24:48,630 --> 02:24:49,490
I'll be right back.

1870
02:25:03,530 --> 02:25:05,650
I've booked a ticket in the flight
which you are boarding.

1871
02:25:06,630 --> 02:25:09,220
So, I will be beside you until
you board the flight. Okay?

1873

Come on, if you cry even for this...

1874

Wipe your tears.

1875
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:25,390
Come, let's go.

1876
02:25:36,780 --> 02:25:37,800
