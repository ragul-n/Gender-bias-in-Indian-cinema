1
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:56,590
Coffee, Please

2
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:34,965
â™ªâ™ª

3
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:36,755
Coffee

4
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:45,673
â™ªâ™ª

5
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:53,630
â™ªâ™ª

6
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:00,495
Huh... What...

7
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:03,121
Why don't you kill me then?

8
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,000
Dip the holy twig in the water

9
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,879
Wear it on your ring finger

10
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:33,244
On the ring-finger

11
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,281
I wear my ring on this finger

12
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:37,980
Alright...

13
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:41,340
Take some rice, soak it, and place it there

14
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:48,984
Take the scutch grass twig,
soak it, and place it there as well

15
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,705
Started a while back?
- No, just now

16
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:56,861
Take some water,
invoking the seven holy rivers...

17
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,465
Which are..?
- Hm ?

18
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:04,978
Ganga,

19
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,767
Cauvery...

20
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:09,767
hmm...

21
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:12,410
River Nile?

22
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,873
Just place it here

23
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:21,324
Mix the rice with the curd,
and make fourteen balls

24
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,303
Invoking your father in your prayers,

25
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:25,912
place them one by one
along with the other offerings

26
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:31,744
But Madhavan, why fourteen times?

27
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:38,923
Kunjappan used to eat a lot,
fourteen might not be sufficient

28
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,614
I don't know, thatâ€™s why I am asking
- I think it should be 16

29
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,703
But...

30
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:44,700
Isn't that how it should be?

31
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:47,298
Isn't today the 14th day
after his death?

32
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:49,203
Death?
Did you see him die?

33
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:51,660
Then you tell me, how many days has it been?
- Ah!

34
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:53,864
Then you can put the blame on meâ€¦

35
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:55,590
Do whatever!

36
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:58,798
Volley it long... long ball, or else they'll score
- Pass it here!

37
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,298
Pass it along!
- Come On!!

38
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,090
Just missed!

39
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:05,033
Chuppa! Throw the ball back in

40
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:06,643
Prasannan, are you done here?

41
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,166
Just a moment,
we are about to lose

42
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,067
Come on boys,
back to positions

43
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:12,508
Whatâ€™s up, Madhu?

44
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:15,026
You've been here a while now.
Lot of leaves, huh?

45
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,358
I quit the job,
Didn't work out

46
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,591
For you or for them?
- Chuppa!

47
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,898
I'll see you later

48
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,006
I am so out of form these days!

49
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:23,677
So, what is it?

50
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:25,257
I have got a new job

51
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:26,784
Go resign and return, as always!

52
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:27,511
Listen!

53
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,807
In Bengaluru!

54
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,881
Are you nuts?

55
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:35,247
Your Dad won't let you work even in Ernakulam...

56
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:36,406
let alone Bengaluru!

57
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,194
I think, I should take him
with me this time

58
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:40,027
Ah!

59
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:41,941
That's a good idea, Chuppa
- hm

60
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:43,447
But...

61
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,673
...we'll have to
present it tactically

62
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:47,801
The usual methods won't work

63
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,986
See,

64
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,048
Given the date the body was found and its condition,
this could be Day 14.

65
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,024
Which body?
Have you seen it?

66
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,087
Huh?

67
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:58,751
Eat... Eat as much as you can

68
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:01,076
He has ruined this too!

69
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:03,881
Alright! He is not dead.
The body was not his, either.

70
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,184
But he is dead to me.
Do you have a problem with that?

71
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,632
14 or 16...

72
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:11,710
...with or without curd,
you decide that for your own last rites

73
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:14,206
What I offer my dad,
is for me to decide

74
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,399
Why don't you have the snacks and leave quietly

75
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,916
instead of creating trouble?

76
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,556
I don't eat from outside

77
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:24,423
Why don't you just leave then?

78
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:25,549
Dad!

79
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:30,465
Hey Subramaniyan!
Take him away

80
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,601
Unbelievable!
- Just unbelievable!

81
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,368
What is unbelievable?
The fellow was planning to kill his father

82
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,753
So Kunjappan ran away.
Surely, he isn't dead

83
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,057
He dug up some dead body claiming it is Kunjappan's
and is performing the last rites

84
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:48,744
What he is doing is unbelievable!
- That too is unbelievable!

85
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,860
Uncle, the newspaper

86
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,429
Has your blood sugar gone up?
You look pale and thin

87
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,199
Uncle,

88
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,863
last night, there was a fantastic show
on the TV

89
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,908
"Crime Report"

90
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,098
At Kollam... an old man living alone...

91
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:25,965
...of approximately your age...

92
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,023
was gruesomely murdered by his neighbour

93
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,907
Living alone is not safe at all!

94
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,466
But I am not alone here

95
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:37,317
Uncle...

96
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:40,557
The lad has landed a job...

97
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:41,931
...in Bengaluru

98
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:44,354
A good salary of Rs 1 Lakh a month

99
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,782
You could move with him

100
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:47,588
and we can let this house out on rent

101
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:54,552
I can guarantee you a rent of ten thousand a month

102
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:58,119
Over there, nobody could clobber your head off...

103
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,720
You'll be safe!

104
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:26,215
Prasannan

105
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:38,855
Take up a job
that would let you sleep in your own house

106
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:40,588
No matter what

107
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,257
Dad, shall I?

108
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,801
Ground enough?

109
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:00,191
Yeah!
It's good to go

110
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,688
No, itâ€™s not

111
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,963
This is why you
should not do this

112
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:07,965
Dad!

113
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,798
What job could I get here?

114
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:15,382
Jobs don't come riding on their own to you.
You need to look for them

115
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:30,923
Where are you going?
- Just to the play ground

116
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:33,798
If you don't mind losing,
join me for a game

117
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:35,560
I do mind losing

118
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,425
At least for a while?

119
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,402
May be at night.
I have some work now

120
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:42,782
Jobs don't come riding on their own, do they?

121
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:47,148
Aren't you going for work today?

122
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:48,382
I will. Itâ€™s not time yet

123
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:52,416
What time would that be?
- I've got many apprentices there

124
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,393
...they will manage.
It is a Pharma job after all

125
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:55,871
That is what you always say

126
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:57,676
Do I?
- Yes, often

127
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:58,590
No way!

128
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:01,673
There he is!

129
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:10,382
Are you taking your dad along to Bengaluru?

130
00:10:11,023 --> 00:10:12,273
Did he get a job there too?

131
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:16,648
Yes, as a computer engineer!
- No joke, Bengaluru is a hub of engineers,

132
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:19,825
Let his dad too be one.
There are so many elderly engineers around

133
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:22,819
Old doctors and engineers are
the most sought after ones

134
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:24,307
Have you noticed?
- That's right

135
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:26,589
My dear Madhu,
I am not going anywhere.

136
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:27,839
A cup of tea, please

137
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:29,460
Just like me

138
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,883
Chuppan, can you go home immediately?

139
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:33,203
Itâ€™s urgent.
- What is it?

140
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:34,382
Your father had a fall

141
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:43,896
What happened?

142
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,132
He fell down while washing clothes

143
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:48,927
Bhaskaran, why would you live alone?
Why don't you get him married?

144
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,114
Move this bucket a bit

145
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:53,382
Hmm...

146
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:58,120
You're not taking the pills, are you?

147
00:10:58,382 --> 00:11:00,292
You don't have to yell.
He is not deaf

148
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,542
Really?

149
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:03,257
I do

150
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:07,382
Bhaskaran, skipping the
pills won't do you any good

151
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:11,090
If something happens, everyone suffers

152
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:12,423
You do your job

153
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:21,132
Don't waste it

154
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:22,507
Why would I!

155
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,756
I don't have much to do here.
Itâ€™s a chronic disease

156
00:11:38,582 --> 00:11:41,366
You never know when he will kick the bucket

157
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:45,026
We can only get him to
take his medicines on time

158
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:47,480
Get someone for the
household chores

159
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:49,364
How long will he do all this?
He is an old man

160
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:53,798
& get a job yourself.
Aren't you an electronics engineer?

161
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:55,727
Mechanical

162
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,173
You have no hope!
- Didn't I say so?

163
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:03,173
Prasananan...

164
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,359
We need a home nurse
- For you?

165
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:09,264
Not for meâ€¦ for the household chores
and to look after Dad

166
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,483
Oh, that kind of nurse

167
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,173
Itâ€™s not the safest of ideas

168
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:14,318
No women are safe here, is it?

169
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:16,623
Why are you looking at me?

170
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:19,279
He meant home nurses cannot be trusted

171
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:21,132
They often steal things

172
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,298
There is nothing to be stolen,
but my dad

173
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:26,298
There is an agency in Perumba,
where you get good nurses

174
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:37,257
If you had such plans,
you could have told me

175
00:12:39,048 --> 00:12:40,436
Dad! Come on
It is not that

176
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:42,639
I told you yesterday.
She is a home nurse

177
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,995
What should I cook for dinner?

178
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:50,019
What?

179
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:51,738
What would you like to eat?

180
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,382
Take her away

181
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,160
The kitchen is that way

182
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:08,549
Enough

183
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:12,048
Wow, tastes just like Dad's cooking

184
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:13,535
Because I made it

185
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:20,257
Sir, he did not let me do anything,
he did all the cooking

186
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:25,090
Is she a Poduval?

187
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:28,684
Mr. Bhaskaran Poduval,
What lies in Caste!

188
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:31,675
She is from a very reputed upper caste
family in Haryana

189
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,083
Her highly reputed upper caste family
is much higher than Poduvals

190
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:35,926
Isn't it ?

191
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:39,924
How long have you known her?

192
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,752
I met her today,
at the agency

193
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,631
hmm

194
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:48,298
I know you are not the type

195
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,520
What type?

196
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:52,614
She is pregnant

197
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,507
She has been vomiting continuously

198
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:58,507
Three months
- Congratulations!

199
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,791
So...

200
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,947
What do we do then?

201
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:05,965
If there is nothing to do, I'll leave.
Is that OK?

202
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:09,549
Not O-K, V-K...
I'm V-K Bhaskaran Poduval

203
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:13,725
You can call me Bhaskaran

204
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:15,840
You may leave

205
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:18,062
OK

206
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:22,073
That means alright in Hindi!

207
00:14:23,173 --> 00:14:24,642
Oh!

208
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:33,292
Number seems unusual, might be some virus.
You could lose money

209
00:14:36,284 --> 00:14:37,733
Hello!

210
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:49,994
Have I not told you not to ride a motorbike?

211
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:53,243
Are you taking your medicines
regularly as advised?

212
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:58,618
Dad, listen.
Please hear me out

213
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,173
I am 34 now. Look at my head...
I am losing my hair

214
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,215
Soon, I will go bald as
Bharat Gopi!

215
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:07,465
My classmates always tease me.
- Where are you going?

216
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:08,756
I have work to do

217
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,676
Listen, 'Mate'!
I have got yet another job

218
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,104
This time in a Japanese company.
I must go

219
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,230
So, what about me?

220
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,121
You come with me

221
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,324
I am not coming to Japan!

222
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:31,048
Those slanted eyes,
short-legged fellows - just like you

223
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,795
Everyone looks the same,

224
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,531
almost like the Chinese

225
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:39,631
Dad, the company is Japanese.
my office would be in Russia

226
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,064
Ah! That itself is dubious

227
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,989
Is there no space in Japan
that they set their office in Russia?

228
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:47,257
Frauds for sure!

229
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:50,499
Have your gruel and
look for a job here

230
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:53,394
Did you make me an engineer
to work here in Payyannur?

231
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,573
What else?
To send you to Russia?

232
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:00,392
Itâ€™s only a matter of four years

233
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:02,266
There are many Malayalees there...

234
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,260
...and other friends too.
I can visit frequently

235
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,631
So, if I die, my dead body will be kept in a
freezer until you come!

236
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,508
I don't want myself freezing in one of those boxes

237
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:18,876
Dad, stop fooling around please

238
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,667
If I don't take up this job as well

239
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:23,758
I will lose my mind and hang myself right here

240
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:28,486
No matter what you say

241
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:31,982
I will find a good home nurse, and take up this job

242
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,590
I repeat, employing a home nurse is
not a safe option

243
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,777
I suggest you try that woman
who is tending to Sreedharan's mother... Karthiyayini

244
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,890
Hey, not her
She is too old

245
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:02,662
I didn't mean it that way.
If you hire someone that old

246
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:05,304
you'd have to get someone to look after her
if she falls sick

247
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:10,026
Bhaskaran will be looked after by Karthiyayini and
Karthiyayini will be tended to by another nurse

248
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:12,791
The three of them in that house will be a sight!

249
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:15,361
Why would she need another person?
She is a home nurse after all

250
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:18,041
If something happens to her,
she will look after herself

251
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,919
Prasannan
- Yes!

252
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:36,997
Such a huge house for a single man?

253
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:40,001
There were many people here.
Some died and some went abroad

254
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:41,382
Still...
- What?

255
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:45,887
You can make extensions to a house whenever.
But can you remove them when the number of people decrease?

256
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:46,894
Come on in

257
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:50,965
How is it?

258
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:57,384
Is there nothing here?

259
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,756
But we are hiring you to make something

260
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,680
How do I make something with nothing?

261
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,141
Is there a mixer?
Or a grinder?

262
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:04,485
Thatâ€™s the fun part!

263
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,153
Uncle does not like those machines.
Everything should be hand-made.

264
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:08,458
Not even a TV?

265
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,274
Whenever you feel like watching TV,
come over to my place

266
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,507
You can watch your TV serials on your smartphone

267
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,499
It will cost me some Gigabytes!

268
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:18,452
One more thing

269
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:22,529
Please remember, if you fall sick,
you will be your own home nurse too

270
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:25,423
and I will pay only for one of you'll

271
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:29,673
So why don't you'll catch up
while I go and bring them

272
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,890
Hello!
- Ah. Haven't seen you around in two days

273
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:38,923
Got into some trouble

274
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:41,353
I stitched a churidar
for this girl

275
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:42,929
It was a bit tight

276
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:45,179
Heard her brother was after me

277
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,738
So I was in hiding for two days

278
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:47,977
Hiding!
- Didn't even open the shop

279
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:49,640
Did you tell the cops?
- Nah!

280
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:51,250
Can't you see me reading?

281
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:53,423
Mani!
- Yes!

282
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:54,798
A tea for me, please

283
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:59,697
You want it strong, right?
- Absolutely!

284
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:00,676
Murali...

285
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:06,015
... heard that you are being replaced in the
temple committee, is it true?

286
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:08,130
Who told you?
- Rumors are doing rounds

287
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:11,923
You are of no use to the temple, they say

288
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,055
Did you put some cardamom?
- Why not! you are like a brother, right?

289
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,965
Is there any truth in it, Murali?
- Why don't you have your tea and leave?

290
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:23,432
Mani, I too want a teaâ€¦

291
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:25,010
but without the cardamom

292
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:27,599
Why?
- Do I look like your brother?

293
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:33,414
I think I have
seen her somewhere

294
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,395
She is our new tenant...

295
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,480
...from Wayanad

296
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:40,521
They moved here because of her daughter's studies
- Oh, okay

297
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,048
Let me take the news paper

298
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,388
Hope you remember the terms.
- I know

299
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,058
Can you get some tea?
- No, thanks!

300
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:50,483
You are at my stall for the first time
- The thing is my daughter is home alone

301
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:52,924
She will be fine.
A cup of tea won't take too long

302
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:54,822
The tea here is quite famous

303
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,095
Isn't it, Raghu?
- Of course!

304
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:59,459
Without sugar, please
- Alright!

305
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,149
"Do not use Soap in the temple pond"

306
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:26,455
Brother!

307
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:31,785
Aren't you Bhaskaran?
- Yes

308
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:33,000
I am Ramanan

309
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:33,675
So?

310
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:36,974
Didn't you take my 'Chandrika' soap?
- I did not take anything

311
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:40,231
A woman saw you taking it

312
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,894
Haven't you seen the sign there
reading soaps are not allowed?

313
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:44,449
I can't read Malayalam

314
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:48,714
I only have one. My wife bought it.
- Move over

315
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,048
My wife gave it to me

316
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:56,633
Only you were there.
Birds are not going to take it...

317
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:19,714
â™ª

318
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:25,965
I want my soap, please

319
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,104
I think your sugar
level has gone up again

320
00:21:29,151 --> 00:21:29,844
Prasannan...

321
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:32,590
He has become thin as a rake

322
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,298
Karthiyayini...

323
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,756
Oh Come on... Karthiyayini!

324
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:49,066
Huh!

325
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,669
You said there was going to be one guy

326
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,394
Yes, there will be only one person... "Bhaskaran"
I will leave in a bit and Subramaniyan will leave tomorrow

327
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:01,179
or else, I will leave now

328
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:15,016
This spread is only because its the first day

329
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,881
Enough

330
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:20,423
Is she too from an â€˜upper casteâ€™?

331
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,814
Go ahead! Don't worry.
My father is a pure Brahmin

332
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,275
Karthiyayini, we need to talk
- You tell me

333
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,133
Dad is particular about somethings... like

334
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:36,340
He doesnâ€™t like food ground in the mixer or grinder,
he wants his tea and medicines on time

335
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,385
He is temperamental
So I must keep my voice down and never talk back

336
00:22:39,673 --> 00:22:42,549
Moderate salt and no sugar

337
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:44,631
and no singing.
Isn't that it?

338
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,590
How did you know? Did Prasannan tell you all this?
- No need of telling all these

339
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,875
I have come across many a demons.
He is barely the worst

340
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:57,746
So, thatâ€™s that then. Peace.

341
00:22:57,874 --> 00:23:00,855
You can fly off to Japan or Russia
or wherever in peace as well

342
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,910
Steel plates don't break

343
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:26,495
Dad...

344
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,456
Such an opportunity may not come again

345
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:33,292
It hurts to leave
you by yourself

346
00:23:33,423 --> 00:23:34,438
That's not true

347
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:39,280
If you feel what you are doing is right,
then you must go

348
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:41,840
Really?

349
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,173
Hmm

350
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:48,090
I can't tie you up

351
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:51,012
You are not a cow

352
00:23:57,923 --> 00:24:00,423
â™ª â™ª

353
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:03,107
Karthiyayini, pack those chilly fryums

354
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:04,549

Uncle, are you going to Russia too?

356
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,087
Sure! He is at the right age for that

357
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:11,764
Then who will take care of the cow?
- Is the cow the problem?

358
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:14,267
Of course!
Cows are a major problem now

359
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:15,689
Is it a problem there?
- No

I'm not going anywhere,

So those who go to Russia have a problem?

364

Come on Prasannan!
- Oh, I did not mean you

365
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:36,482
I was wondering about
international diplomacy

366
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:39,266
Only those who do not have the
courage to stay, flee their homeland

367
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:57,558
Dad! There are women around

368

There is very little and I am not sharing any of it.

How come I was not informed that the IC is not in supply!

00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:45,199
With this kind of irresponsible behavior
we are not going anywhere forward

Whatâ€™s wrong with you?

381

Even though he was bedridden,

00:37:45,178 --> 00:37:46,842
Don't think we can
take it in ourselves

526
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,723
Hey, Babu

527
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:52,075
Lend a hand, could you?

528
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,152
Lucky I spotted him

529
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:55,446
We'd have had to hire a porter otherwise
- True

530
00:37:55,918 --> 00:37:57,085
Straight ahead

531
00:37:58,631 --> 00:37:59,965
Hey!

532
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:02,955
God...!
I am off

533
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:06,180
Your father becomes a monster on seeing me
Such a nice gentleman otherwise

534
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:08,726
That is it.
You go to hell! I am leaving

535
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:11,823
Doesn't give me a moment's rest

536
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:18,969
For 4000 rs... He thinks he can get a Duke
to look after himself

537
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:22,678
Wait a minute...!
That's your father right?

538
00:38:23,508 --> 00:38:25,194
You hired me, didn't you?

539
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:27,026
Well, find someone else!

540
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:29,726
I am out of here

541
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,018
That is the fourth one in two weeks!

542
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,601
Give it

543
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:41,517
Driver, bring that box too, please?

544
00:38:42,435 --> 00:38:45,293
Why this unexpected visit?
Thought I'll surprise you, Dad!

545
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:46,142
Hmm

546
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:49,779
So, I'll get going then.
- Why would you not stay for tea?

547
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:51,763
Thought I'll surprise you, Uncle!

548
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:01,392
Ah

549
00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:03,168
What is this?

550
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:06,726
Filling up a form for
the agriculture office

551
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:12,577
You are writing across the margins.
Itâ€™s time you got rid of these glasses

552
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,434
It'll be worse without glasses

553
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:19,629
Not like that. I mean,
you need to change this to a more powerful one

554
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:23,046
Now that you are back...

555
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:28,038
I am on a visit

556
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:31,688
I have even booked my return tickets

557
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:42,112
Get me some warm water

558
00:40:11,153 --> 00:40:12,236
Dad!

559
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:14,765
Come here for a moment

560
00:40:19,945 --> 00:40:20,903
What?

561
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:28,751
Hey! What on...
- Dad... Wait!

562
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:33,008
What the hell is this?

563
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,225
Hello, Mr. Bhaskaran!

564
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:56,981
I am Version 5.25 by Kyoto Dynamics,
Good evening, glad to meet you

565
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,976
This is the new home nurse,
I was talking about

566
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,642
When are you going back?

567
00:41:02,806 --> 00:41:07,392
I am...
- Leave tomorrow and take this with you

568
00:41:07,684 --> 00:41:09,183
Uh-oh

569
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:15,183
Dad... Dad

570
00:41:15,613 --> 00:41:20,031
Just say it you cannot look after me
Don' try to do your 'duty'

571
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:22,759
This metal man is the last thing
I want in my life

572
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:26,876
Dad, look at it like a human.
Someone who obeys just you

573
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,626
I don't need any such woman...

574
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:37,183
..or man here

575
00:41:39,183 --> 00:41:40,559
Consider it a child...!

576
00:41:41,726 --> 00:41:45,666
I am a burden for my own child,
and I must do with a machine child

577
00:41:46,452 --> 00:41:49,755
You don't like mixers, grinders,
fridges, phones, or TVs

578
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:52,000
or humans
or a robot even!

579
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,559
How are you going to survive, Dad?

580
00:41:56,629 --> 00:42:00,105
Because I lived like this,
you are here and you could make these things

581
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,984
Only time will tell what kind of kids
you will have

582
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:04,891
What should I do? You tell me

583
00:42:05,038 --> 00:42:06,921
Do you take my permission
for everything?

584
00:42:06,946 --> 00:42:11,368
Did you ask me when you went to Russia?
Or hire a home nurse?

585
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,218
Huh!

586
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:15,642
For whom is this performance?

587
00:42:16,064 --> 00:42:18,434
What are you talking about?
Itâ€™s my duty, right?

588
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:22,441
Love is not a duty,
Itâ€™s a sort of knowledge

589
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:23,596
Copy that

590
00:42:28,357 --> 00:42:31,011
This is your problem,
First you yell...

591
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:34,449
and then deliver a lecture or movie dialogues
- Have you ever thought of me?

592
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:37,357
I havenâ€™t slept peacefully after
I left you here alone

593
00:42:37,648 --> 00:42:42,190
Each time the phone rings, I get anxious.
You know?

594
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:43,805
I will try to know

595
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,040
There you go!

596
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:49,522
So, the problem isn't me.
Itâ€™s your anxiety about me

597
00:42:49,836 --> 00:42:52,266
You should be treated,
not me.

598
00:42:56,606 --> 00:43:02,540
I'll stay here...
Cook you breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday

599
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:05,097
The evening tea as well

600
00:43:30,197 --> 00:43:31,864
What now?

601
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:37,610
Forget what I said

602
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:40,142
Don't be upset.
Go back tomorrow itself

603
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,392
Go resign the job and come back

604
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:54,966
Good God!

605
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:59,027
Good morning, Mr. Bhaskaran!
Some tea?

606
00:43:59,149 --> 00:44:02,078
Have it, Dad.
He is from an upper caste in Japan

607
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:25,648
Mr. Subramaniyan, would you
like to have some tea?

608
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:31,940
Mr. Bhaskaran, tea

609
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:35,940
Didnâ€™t I tell you, I don't want it?

610
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,024
No, you did not.
You just walked away silently

611
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:39,315
That means 'No'

612
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,357
Copy that

613
00:44:40,482 --> 00:44:41,990
What should I do with this tea?

614
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:43,288
How about you bake a cake with it?

615
00:44:43,315 --> 00:44:46,815
Sorry, wrong command.
Can't do that with tea

616
00:44:48,024 --> 00:44:49,040
Then you drink it

617
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:51,505
Robots donâ€™t drink anything

618
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:55,274
I will kill him

619
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:57,606
You can kill me but "I'll be back"

620
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:01,982
What should I do with the tea?

621
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:04,994
Pour it over my head

622
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:09,857
A Robot would never harm its owner,
unless it is forced to.

623
00:45:12,357 --> 00:45:14,442
Then you will know who I am

624
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:18,521
Very bad

625
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:26,812
Where is this from?

626
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,232
He cooked it

627
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:32,585
No, thanks

628
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,536
Thatâ€™s my room,
this is the study

629
00:45:41,248 --> 00:45:42,783
and this one is for Pooja

630
00:45:44,065 --> 00:45:45,447
Who is Pooja?

631
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:47,963
Pooja... the room where...

632
00:45:48,385 --> 00:45:49,431
the room for Pooja

633
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,423
Who is Pooja?

634
00:45:52,474 --> 00:45:54,183
Ah! See...

635
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:56,386
I knew he was a creep!

636
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:00,482
How is 5.25 doing?

637
00:46:01,232 --> 00:46:04,800
Would have been perfect for me.
I doubt if Dad will use it

638
00:46:05,773 --> 00:46:09,357
Please make it happen and come fast.
We all miss you

639
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:11,505

641
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,940
Well, that he knows

642
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:37,455
That's ash from the
firewood we burnt yesterday

643
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,707
We keep that
out in the morning

644
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,455
Can be used as fertilizer for plants

645
00:46:40,648 --> 00:46:41,440
Copy that

646
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:42,705
See Dad...

647
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:47,112
Its a fast learner.
Nobody knows everything by birth, right?

648
00:46:47,441 --> 00:46:48,166
Right?

649
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:32,865
Dad!

650
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:37,606
Hey!

651
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:43,936
Who kept these out?

652
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:47,217
Mr. Bhaskaran,
please donâ€™t shout

653
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:49,127
Your blood pressure will increase

654
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:53,985
which could result in an increase
in the flow of blood to the brain cells

655
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:57,881
causing either a brain hemorrhage
or a block in the heart

656
00:47:57,906 --> 00:47:59,494
inducing a cardiac arrest

657
00:48:04,065 --> 00:48:05,657
Who kept this there?

658
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:10,301
Found them when I was cleaning the room
Since ash could be used as a fertilizer...

659
00:48:11,815 --> 00:48:14,940
Only one us can live here.
You or me

What have you done?

661
00:48:27,312 --> 00:48:31,339
That was my mom and grandpa in those urns!
We were meant to immerse them

662
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,737
That will surely kill them

663

Yeah... Right

685
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:54,016
You can switch it off

00:54:56,898 --> 00:54:58,399
Letâ€™s get into the character
- Hmm

705
00:54:58,606 --> 00:55:01,732
It's time for destruction,Let the ice mounts go berserk.....

706
00:55:02,274 --> 00:55:05,732
...and river Ganges swell with rage.Itâ€™s time..

707
00:55:06,024 --> 00:55:10,517
..for the incarnation of Lord Siva
No devotee should die anymore

708
00:55:10,815 --> 00:55:11,980
Whatâ€™s the matter?

709
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:13,777
Look, donâ€™t get mad
- Hmm

710
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,175
Your father is not dead

711
00:55:16,315 --> 00:55:19,315
I saw him at
Bhaskaranâ€™s house, wearing a helmet

712
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:22,606
I had a feeling that the body was not his

713
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:25,387
Vinu, your father Kunjappan
is still alive

714
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:27,606
Wait a sec

715
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:39,326
You disgraceful scumbag of a father...

716
00:55:40,648 --> 00:55:43,266
...you are destined to die at my hands

717
00:55:45,205 --> 00:55:48,840
You will not kill anybody with
your helmet ever again

718
00:56:09,819 --> 00:56:12,790
Didn't you hear? Kunjappan is back.
He is in Bhaskaran's house

719
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:19,266
Vinu's father Kunjappan was one of those psychopaths.
He would steal in people's house wearing a helmet

720
00:56:19,357 --> 00:56:21,065
Whoever spotted him
was bludgeoned to death

721
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:24,824
When Vinu learnt this and threatened him, Kunjappan fled.
A blood bath is certain today

[PA SYSTEM] Everyone is welcome

724
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:32,758
Wait...

725
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,700
Stop...
let me have a look first

726
00:56:45,857 --> 00:56:46,725
What is it?

727
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,125
Uncle, has that Psychopath
Kunjappan come here?

728
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:54,811
Psychopath?
- Babu says, he saw a man in a helmet here

729
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:57,305
Mr. Bhaskaran, tea

730
00:57:00,732 --> 00:57:01,927
What is this, Uncle?

731
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:05,940
That...

732
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,414
...is my son's friend

733
00:57:07,439 --> 00:57:10,363
He is looking for a job here
Will be here for a few days

734
00:57:10,648 --> 00:57:12,606
Good morning!
- Hello!

735
00:57:14,065 --> 00:57:15,950
So, Uncle...
this was what was in the box!

736
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,946
Did it come in pieces?
Did he assemble it here?

737
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:20,704
Can it do all jobs?

738
00:57:20,747 --> 00:57:21,854
Who knows!

739
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:24,879
I know...
I can do all kind of jobs

740
00:57:25,565 --> 00:57:30,428
What is your name, Sir?
-I am Robot, Android Version 5.25

741
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,263
Robert!

742
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,794
You must be a Christian

743
00:57:34,857 --> 00:57:38,097
I'm Prasannan. I am a Poduval.
He is my uncle.

744
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,873
Glad to meet you!

745
00:57:44,773 --> 00:57:45,909
Come!

746
00:57:52,024 --> 00:57:53,107
Robot!

747
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,389
So actually...

748
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:59,281
This is not Kunjappan,
Since Uncle is not well...

749
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,065
and Subramaniyan is very busy in Russia.
So he brought this to help out Uncle

750
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:05,748
His name is Robert

751
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:07,522
Does it have WiFi?
- Don't think so

752
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,951
I think itâ€™s Android

753
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:12,648
Nah, must be Windows

754
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:15,394
Now, if you'd like you can take a selfie
and then please leave

755
00:58:18,303 --> 00:58:22,565
Doesn't he look like
Kunjappan from behind?

756
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:31,387
Come, letâ€™s take a selfie
- Please wait for your turn!

757
00:58:32,898 --> 00:58:34,426
Did you hear?

758
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:38,041
Bhaskaran has gotten a
robot to take care of him

759
00:58:38,256 --> 00:58:39,337
Really?

760
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:42,366
He makes tea, cooks meals,
does the laundry, mops the house...

761
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:44,468
It can even clean
his shit after him

762
00:58:44,493 --> 00:58:46,788
and feed him
- Feed him the shit?

763
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,482
No you fool! Proper meals

764
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:52,424
This is against our culture.
- Murali, you think it can stitch?

765
00:58:52,513 --> 00:58:54,969
Maybe, it does.
But it cannot fix the buttons for sure

766
00:58:55,024 --> 00:58:59,514
They say it can read minds
- And we cannot even read the written word!

767
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,992
Is it a male?
- Of course

768
00:59:00,992 --> 00:59:00,993
Is it a male?
- Of course
Android Kunjappan.
So, definitely a male

769
00:59:00,993 --> 00:59:03,223
Android Kunjappan.
So, definitely a male

770
00:59:03,565 --> 00:59:06,611
Don't goof up this time.
Make sure I am in focus

771
00:59:07,114 --> 00:59:10,270
Sir, we are from the Kannur News.
We heard about the Robot

772
00:59:10,302 --> 00:59:11,606
Come on in

773
00:59:12,274 --> 00:59:16,441
Robert!
Ah... TV news reporters!

774
00:59:17,717 --> 00:59:20,920
Robot looks quite old
- Hey, this is my uncle. Not the robot.

775
00:59:20,951 --> 00:59:22,936
Oh Sorry!

776
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:23,882
Yes?

777
00:59:23,907 --> 00:59:26,141
Sir, we are from Kannur Vision.
We heard about the robot.

778
00:59:26,205 --> 00:59:28,006
Who brought it here?

779
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,482
My son.
- Can we meet him?

780
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:34,387
He is in Russ.. err ..Japan

781
00:59:35,187 --> 00:59:37,793
Is that him?
- Cut... Cut

782
00:59:38,732 --> 00:59:40,207
That's Arnold Schwarzenegger!

783
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:42,161
Mr. Bhaskaran!

784
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:44,301
That's Robert

785
00:59:44,606 --> 00:59:47,051
A call from Subramaniyan

786
00:59:48,115 --> 00:59:50,449
Dad, hows everything there?

787
00:59:50,773 --> 00:59:53,767
Well, I have lost my piece of mind

788
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,615
Move over.
Hello Sir, what do you do?

789
00:59:59,898 --> 01:00:02,971
Please leave my Dad alone.
Don't create a ruckus there

790
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,612
Please everyone just leave

791
01:00:04,648 --> 01:00:06,565
Let them do their job, Subramaniyan

792
01:00:07,522 --> 01:00:10,121
People need to know about our product

793
01:00:23,606 --> 01:00:25,522
Good Morning, Mr.Babu!

794
01:00:30,357 --> 01:00:31,416

How do you know...

804
01:01:02,566 --> 01:01:05,009
We donâ€™t need a
newspaper from tomorrow

805
01:01:06,982 --> 01:01:08,482
It's not for you to decide!

806
01:01:08,982 --> 01:01:11,743
You can call me names or abuse me,
but donâ€™t stop the newspaper

807
01:01:14,565 --> 01:01:17,249
Only someone who reads the newspaper
knows its joy

808
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:19,915
You read to gain knowledge, not joy

809
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:22,200
I like to read it when I am on the pot

810
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,798
Will you come in there
too with the 'knowledge'

811
01:01:24,969 --> 01:01:26,006
Why not?

812
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:28,057
Huh! Have you no shame?

813
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:29,990
Of course, not

814
01:01:30,015 --> 01:01:33,280
You come from a place where people
clean their asses with paper

815
01:01:33,336 --> 01:01:34,655
Why would you have shame?

816
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:37,305
Shame? What is it?

817
01:01:41,107 --> 01:01:43,940
Bhaskaran, I've got to go.
Lots of houses to cover

818
01:01:46,923 --> 01:01:47,944
May I help you?

819
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:09,593
How do you know Babu?

820
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,698
Facebook

821
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,036
Can you get information on anyone?

822
01:02:18,223 --> 01:02:20,410
Anyone who has a Facebook account

823
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,748
What about Prasannan?

824
01:02:24,552 --> 01:02:27,965
He has no Email, Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram,

825
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,937
Whatsapp, or Skype.
No Google search results either

826
01:02:31,065 --> 01:02:32,850
Prasannan does not exist.

827
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:36,936
There is no evidence that
such a person is alive

828
01:02:48,107 --> 01:02:49,149
There is worm in it

829
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:03,866
Worm

830
01:03:20,149 --> 01:03:21,166
All clear

831
01:03:45,857 --> 01:03:47,565
Vitamin A, 38%

832
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:16,595
Dad!

833
01:04:18,349 --> 01:04:20,364
Ah... When did you come?

834
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,434
Do you get it now?
Technology can bring people closer

835
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:30,858
Nothing new in peeping toms
looking into other people's bedrooms

836
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:34,638
Get out!

837
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,328
How's it going?

838
01:04:41,533 --> 01:04:44,706
He is quite the grumpy old man
Thankfully, he hasn't torn it apart yet

839
01:04:46,656 --> 01:04:47,681
Nice

840
01:04:48,853 --> 01:04:49,978
May I help you?

841
01:04:50,331 --> 01:04:51,408
No, I got it

842
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:58,541
I was built to look after you, itâ€™s my duty

843
01:04:59,968 --> 01:05:01,898
You are built to deceive me

844
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:05,284
Love is not duty, its an emotion

845
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:09,255
You told Subramaniyan that love
is knowledge, right?

846
01:05:09,512 --> 01:05:10,715
Yeah...

847
01:05:10,754 --> 01:05:12,547
I mean... emotional knowledge is love

848
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:17,653
You won't get that.
It is delicate and has many layers

849
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,544
Where are you off to?

850
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,625
To find you a suitable bride.
Why?

851
01:05:35,915 --> 01:05:37,438
Going to pay the electricity bill

852
01:05:38,274 --> 01:05:40,039
That could be done from here

853
01:05:40,648 --> 01:05:43,021
The electricity office won't come here.
We have to go to it

854
01:05:44,725 --> 01:05:46,248
You can pay it online

855
01:05:46,482 --> 01:05:49,024
Does he never change his clothes?

856
01:05:50,565 --> 01:05:52,806
His son makes so much money

857
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:55,061
Can't he just get him
some decent clothes?

858
01:05:55,086 --> 01:05:59,804
Man maketh Money. Money doesn't maketh man
Either ways, you got to work, right Madhu?

859
01:06:00,483 --> 01:06:01,571
Hi Bhaskaran!

860
01:06:15,357 --> 01:06:18,634
Hey, you look like a squirrel
who just lost his nuts

861
01:06:19,178 --> 01:06:23,492
More like a squirrel
whose 'nuts' were cut away

862
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:25,802
Yeah, looks like that

863
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:30,020
Looks like I might have to
quit this job and return

864
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:33,231
The robot does not
seem to excite Dad at all

865
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:37,766
The robot is not meant to do
anything exciting anyway

866
01:06:43,522 --> 01:06:45,449
Enough, we have to leave

867
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:53,102
Hello
- I have been trying to reach you since forever?

868
01:06:53,536 --> 01:06:55,957
Shall I call you back?
I am little busy now

869
01:06:55,982 --> 01:06:59,924
Nothing much to say when you call back.
Uncle had a fall

870
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,659
That is all there is to say,
even if you call back

871
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,190
Hello... hello

872
01:07:14,773 --> 01:07:16,857
Where's Dad?
- Electricity office

873
01:07:17,024 --> 01:07:17,837
Idiot...!

874
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:20,164
He has met with some accident,
go look for him

875
01:07:20,189 --> 01:07:21,151

880
01:07:55,482 --> 01:07:56,982
There is someone in the yard

881
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,232
It must be some dog or cat

882
01:08:03,149 --> 01:08:04,447
You scared me

01:08:04,898 --> 01:08:06,357
Hello Ms. Seetha

884

Why are you here?

885
01:08:09,606 --> 01:08:13,485
Mr. Bhaskaran has been missing
I came in search of him

886
01:08:13,584 --> 01:08:14,482
Here?

887
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,015
I had to stop because my battery is running low

888

Send him back

Let me check my mail. Do you have WiFi?
- Of course

892
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,982
We'll be accused of stealing it

893
01:08:41,441 --> 01:08:46,024
You won't even take an internet connection
At least let me keep it for a while!

894
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:48,279
How am I even going to get a job!

Mr. Bhaskaran

899
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,896
Is that thing a show piece?

900
01:09:11,077 --> 01:09:13,247
Isn't it installed for a purpose?

901
01:09:16,016 --> 01:09:18,207
Where is it?
Sleeping?

902
01:09:22,107 --> 01:09:26,087
Oh, you are back!
Where were you? Roaming around?

903
01:09:26,606 --> 01:09:29,299
Sir, you need to be proactive
and take responsibility

904
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,745
Have you put on weight?
You must be eating well

905
01:09:33,732 --> 01:09:36,829
Luckily that drunkard Babu found him

906

Subramaniyan is too busy

909
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,822
Lucky that I am
not an Engineer

910
01:09:52,847 --> 01:09:56,332

914

What happened, Dad?

915
01:10:17,315 --> 01:10:19,354
I had a fall

916
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:25,009
Why did you have to go by yourself?
You should have just told him

Bro, Subramaniyanâ€™s company
seems to be a famous one

921
01:10:53,129 --> 01:10:54,484
He must be drawing a fat salary

922
01:10:54,616 --> 01:10:56,783
Of course, must be around
Rs. 4-5 lakhs a month

923
01:10:57,821 --> 01:10:59,529
Why does that bother you?

924
01:10:59,936 --> 01:11:03,158
Five lakhs!
Thatâ€™s a lot more than I imagined

925
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:05,986
I should have chosen Engineering too

926
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:09,948

What would be the cost of that robot?

927
01:11:10,362 --> 01:11:14,523

Never had the courage"

1045
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:27,715
In Japan, you can express your
love freely and openly

1046
01:21:28,112 --> 01:21:32,622
Doesn't work like that here.
We either rape or burn the girl first

1047
01:21:33,862 --> 01:21:37,487
I am too old for any of these

1048
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:42,359
In Japan, you can get married to whomever you like
and whenever you want

1049
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,853
When did I tell you I want to get married?

1050
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:47,607
And stop going on about Japan...

1051
01:21:48,132 --> 01:21:53,936
It is small enough for four men with shovels on either side
to dig up and throw it into the ocean

1052
01:21:54,153 --> 01:21:58,722
Is that the case with India?
The country is huge and so are our problems

1053
01:21:58,986 --> 01:22:02,979
There you can get married
even if you are old

1054
01:22:03,004 --> 01:22:06,567
or even live together
without getting married

1055
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:11,382
Damn, I wish I was born there!

1056
01:22:12,237 --> 01:22:16,612
Here marriage is nothing but
a license to buy groceries

1057
01:22:17,487 --> 01:22:18,496
Hmm

1058
01:22:23,445 --> 01:22:24,654
Hey...!

1059
01:22:26,945 --> 01:22:29,660
Even Chuppan does not know about Saudamini

1060
01:22:30,674 --> 01:22:34,502
You are increasingly
behaving like a typical Malayalee...

1061
01:22:34,554 --> 01:22:36,522
please don't start gossiping
about this to others

1062
01:22:36,547 --> 01:22:38,555
Of course not

1063
01:22:40,695 --> 01:22:43,319
Looks like Bhaskaran Poduval
used to have a one-sided love affair

1064
01:22:43,398 --> 01:22:44,440
Oh.. Really!

1065
01:22:44,945 --> 01:22:47,929
Like a loan given to Vijay Mallya, a
non-performing asset

1066
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:49,529
Oh, nice!

1067
01:22:51,986 --> 01:22:55,376
How much is this?
Rs. 150

1068
01:22:58,570 --> 01:22:59,736
Two

1069
01:23:02,028 --> 01:23:03,821
Ten?

1070
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:05,945
Ten

1071
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:09,945
Five..

1072
01:23:13,986 --> 01:23:15,907
How much?
229

1073
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:18,202
So the change?
You still owe me a rupee

1074
01:23:18,278 --> 01:23:20,571
Yes, that I will give you next month

1075
01:23:20,612 --> 01:23:22,883
We don't need the newspaper from tomorrow

1076
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:26,871
What?
- I read online now

1077
01:23:27,613 --> 01:23:30,237
What about the joy of
reading an actual paper?

1078
01:23:30,445 --> 01:23:32,166
Well, there is joy in this too

1079
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,346
My eye sight is poor

1080
01:23:34,371 --> 01:23:37,292
On a screen,
you can zoom in and make it larger

1081
01:23:40,805 --> 01:23:44,451
Kunjappan... a merciless death awaits you!

1082
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:46,906
upon the good lord!

1083
01:23:48,443 --> 01:23:51,750
You don't get away
with hurting someone in the press

1084
01:23:51,821 --> 01:23:53,610
Better check your horoscope!

1085
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:06,870
Sir, snacks

1086
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:11,391
Serve it to him too

1087
01:24:12,237 --> 01:24:13,570
He doesnâ€™t drink

1088
01:24:13,986 --> 01:24:17,818
We make offerings to god as well,
even if they don't actually eat it

1089
01:24:17,945 --> 01:24:19,237
Keep it there

1090
01:24:26,499 --> 01:24:27,530
Thank you

1091
01:24:27,821 --> 01:24:29,867
We need his time
and date of birth

1092
01:24:30,062 --> 01:24:31,627
and his sun sign

1093
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,765
Hi, Dad

1094
01:24:38,278 --> 01:24:40,195
I need the his time of birth

1095
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,828
What?
- Well, I need it along with the Date

1096
01:24:46,902 --> 01:24:49,237
I donâ€™t know,
give me a moment

1097
01:24:52,203 --> 01:24:54,650
Do you know Kunjappan's date of birth?

1098
01:24:55,129 --> 01:24:57,012
You mean date of manufacturing?

1099
01:24:57,242 --> 01:24:58,824
8 January 2019

1100
01:25:00,112 --> 01:25:02,779
08-01-2019

1101
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:19,691
Those around him, including you,
only have to gain from his company

1102
01:25:19,987 --> 01:25:22,821
However, this is not a good phase for him

1103
01:25:24,529 --> 01:25:27,892
He may have the wrath of many foes.
Perhaps causing some stomach problems

1104
01:25:28,195 --> 01:25:32,254
Maybe a virus?
Like what affects mobiles and computers?

1105
01:25:32,812 --> 01:25:37,477
His eyes could be affected as well.
Maybe a scratch on his lenses?

1106
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,189
Avoid long distance travel.
Your family goddess seems to be unhappy

1107
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:46,028
Nothing to worry.
Everything has a remedy

1108
01:25:46,986 --> 01:25:50,570
Make an offering at the
Payyanur temple and...

1109
01:25:52,237 --> 01:25:57,712
...perform a manikin ritual at the
Chamundi temple in Adukumala, Wayanad

1110
01:25:58,123 --> 01:26:01,375
As soon as possible.
There have been positive results

1111
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:03,539
Stay positive

1112
01:26:11,902 --> 01:26:13,278
Hi Uncle!
Where did you'll go to?

1113
01:26:13,691 --> 01:26:17,316
To the astrologer
- Why?

1114
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,003
Got his horoscope checked

1115
01:26:20,028 --> 01:26:25,420
Got a sanctified amulet for
him to ward off the evil eye

1116
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:30,968
Lets go

1117
01:26:30,993 --> 01:26:35,829
- Is everything...
... else alright?

1118
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,298
Hey!
Get in quick

1119
01:26:48,368 --> 01:26:50,663
You could catch a cold!

1120
01:26:50,932 --> 01:26:52,848
I would have taken those

1121
01:26:55,903 --> 01:27:00,818
Why take a chance

1122
01:27:00,843 --> 01:27:05,004
Didnâ€™t you hear the Astrologer?
There is threat to your life even

1123
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:07,638
Who do I have if
something happens to you?

1124
01:27:07,737 --> 01:27:10,153
Subramaniyan, Prasannan

1125
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:13,763
They'll get old and die
and then who'll I have?

1126
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:20,402
The cessation of life processes
that occurs only in living organisms

1127
01:27:20,615 --> 01:27:23,422
for various reasons including
aging, suicide, murder

1128
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:26,228
disease, accident,
and starvation...

1129
01:27:26,362 --> 01:27:31,133
...is known as Death.
This is not applicable for a Robot.

1130
01:27:33,091 --> 01:27:37,256
Many who thought so have gone on to
become photographic memories

1131
01:27:37,468 --> 01:27:42,189
and roadside busts for crows to shit on.
You won't be different either

1132
01:27:42,237 --> 01:27:45,708
One can erase me.
My memory could be deleted

1133
01:27:45,821 --> 01:27:48,278
Then?
- Then you can sell me as scrap

1134
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:53,069
You can change the password
and add a fingerprint

1135
01:27:53,094 --> 01:27:56,381
After that,
you alone can erase me

1136
01:27:56,406 --> 01:28:01,739
Nobody can see my activities
unless you approve

1137
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:05,986
Otherwise?

1138
01:28:06,487 --> 01:28:11,278
Subramaniyan can watch everything you do
through this camera

1139
01:28:20,112 --> 01:28:23,529
All of it?
- Of course

1140
01:28:37,695 --> 01:28:40,533
Is my lunch ready?
- Just a moment

1141
01:28:44,632 --> 01:28:47,166
There is no curry.
Get some from Prasannan's hotel

1142
01:28:47,267 --> 01:28:48,550
As always

1143
01:28:48,862 --> 01:28:50,283
How many dosas are there?
- Six

1144
01:28:50,308 --> 01:28:52,120
Yeah, don't reduce that now

1145
01:28:54,445 --> 01:28:58,763
You've been brushing forever
- Breakfast is not ready yet

1146
01:28:59,529 --> 01:29:05,570
Raghu, you have got the lyrics wrong
- Will keep that in mind

1147
01:29:06,044 --> 01:29:08,960
Always sings it wrong,
good for nothing

1148
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:12,506
Oh Lord! Stay with me and guide me

1149
01:29:21,237 --> 01:29:23,112
Raghu...

1150
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,483
Is the blouse ready?

1151
01:29:25,558 --> 01:29:28,897
It will be ready in a moment,
you take a ride and come back

1152
01:29:29,028 --> 01:29:32,030
Isn't that what you always say
- Go and come son

1153
01:29:32,195 --> 01:29:36,920
It better be ready by the time I return.
Else, I will burn the bloody shop down

1154
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:50,112
Raghu...
- Bhaskaran!

1155
01:29:50,445 --> 01:29:52,695
I need to stitch a shirt
- Why not?

1156
01:29:58,945 --> 01:30:02,805
Dosa
- Put it back. It's his lunch

1157
01:30:07,843 --> 01:30:10,551
Not for me, itâ€™s for him

1158
01:30:11,962 --> 01:30:14,468
I have grown to stitch a shirt for a robot,
I am honored!

1159
01:30:15,862 --> 01:30:21,320
Shoulder 34; Arm 50; Chest 44;
Waist 28; Height 40

1160
01:30:23,695 --> 01:30:26,237
What a memory!

1161
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:28,812
I need an assistant here,
are you game?

1162
01:30:28,883 --> 01:30:31,547
There is no need
for him to work

1163
01:30:31,572 --> 01:30:34,295
Mind you, my father has
made enough money already

1164
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,337
Isnâ€™t it better if he earns something?

1165
01:30:36,517 --> 01:30:40,138
Who will look after him when he gets old?
- I will

1166
01:30:42,107 --> 01:30:44,028
What did you say your height was?
- 40â€

1167
01:30:44,612 --> 01:30:46,986
Come after a couple of days
- Okay

1168
01:30:47,862 --> 01:30:49,779
Where is the cloth?

1169
01:30:53,071 --> 01:30:55,071
[SINGING]

1170
01:30:58,153 --> 01:30:59,529
Is it done?

1171
01:31:02,529 --> 01:31:04,404
Get the money from my Dad.
- Alright!

1172
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:15,484
Are you drunk today as well?

1173
01:31:17,028 --> 01:31:18,385
How did you know?

1174
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:20,684
You seem to have dressed for work today

1175
01:31:25,534 --> 01:31:27,026
Where are you going?

1176
01:31:27,051 --> 01:31:29,495
For Radha's daughter's wedding.
I'll have lunch there

1177
01:31:29,529 --> 01:31:33,747
I am starving
- I havenâ€™t cooked, you come with me

1178
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:35,326
I am not invited

1179
01:31:35,351 --> 01:31:37,302
Neither am I.
But I am attending

1180
01:31:37,494 --> 01:31:40,286
You got a new blouse made for
a wedding you weren't invited to!

1181
01:31:40,398 --> 01:31:42,440
Do I go without one
because I was not invited?

1182
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:46,640
A portion of curry please

1183
01:31:56,568 --> 01:31:58,484
Curry & Blouse, eh?

1184
01:32:02,695 --> 01:32:04,694
Where is that packet?

1185
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:06,520
I ate it

1186
01:32:07,737 --> 01:32:10,184
What!
You ate my new blouse?

1187
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,986
You try to seduce my wife with
Dosas, you scum!

1188
01:32:23,153 --> 01:32:26,404
I know she is pretty,
but she doesn't need your dosas

1189
01:32:26,612 --> 01:32:29,448
Stop it!
- I did nothing, Kunjappan swapped it

1190
01:32:29,529 --> 01:32:30,654
Leave me

1191
01:32:33,404 --> 01:32:36,736
He will die by my hands,
you mark my words

1192
01:32:36,793 --> 01:32:38,696
Let it go

1193
01:32:39,237 --> 01:32:41,951
Why should I mark his words?
- Right

1194
01:33:04,028 --> 01:33:06,362
Who is Mr.Bhaskaran Poduval?
- Itâ€™s me

1195
01:33:09,525 --> 01:33:11,551
We are from the municipality
- Hello!

1196
01:33:11,612 --> 01:33:13,747
We have got a complaint against you

1197
01:33:13,842 --> 01:33:16,802
Do you have the license to run this?

1198
01:33:17,946 --> 01:33:21,240
I don't need a license, I don't run it
It runs on its own

1199
01:33:22,654 --> 01:33:27,529
Listen, you need sanction from the
government to run such machines

1200
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:30,612
Will you take the responsibility
if it attacks somebody?

1201
01:33:37,151 --> 01:33:38,441
Prasannan...

1202
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,362
What happened, Uncle?
- Call Chuppan

1203
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:45,286
The municipality
took Kunjappan away

1204
01:33:45,311 --> 01:33:46,828
Why do they need a robot?

1205
01:33:46,905 --> 01:33:48,114
Quick...

1206
01:33:59,986 --> 01:34:01,195
Hi Prasannan
- Chuppan...

1207
01:34:01,362 --> 01:34:04,508
Some â€˜Robot catchersâ€™ from the
municipality have taken Kunjappan

1208
01:34:04,711 --> 01:34:06,328
Apparently, we need a license

1209
01:34:06,353 --> 01:34:07,511
The municipality?

1210
01:34:07,536 --> 01:34:08,874
Is Dad around?
- Talk to him

1211
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:12,557
Hello?
- Dad, what happened?

1212
01:34:12,595 --> 01:34:16,126
Kunjappan was home as usual,
they came and took him

1213
01:34:16,223 --> 01:34:17,597
Don't worry Dad

1214
01:34:17,622 --> 01:34:19,801
They can't take him away.
Nothing will happen

1215
01:34:19,826 --> 01:34:21,612
Go home...
Kunjappan will come home soon

1216
01:34:21,737 --> 01:34:26,237
But how could they take that kid
It's not safe these days

1217
01:34:26,362 --> 01:34:34,043
What if they do something to him?
He canâ€™t even cry

1218
01:34:34,112 --> 01:34:38,126
I don't think I can be at peace without him

1219
01:34:38,557 --> 01:34:39,602
Dad...

1220
01:34:41,362 --> 01:34:42,371
Here

1221
01:35:28,883 --> 01:35:29,907
What happened?

1222
01:35:32,646 --> 01:35:37,443
I think he has begun to
think of the robot as his son

1223
01:35:44,533 --> 01:35:49,588
The world has gone rogue ever since
the computer and the internet came along

1224
01:35:49,737 --> 01:35:53,945
Now the people are going to use
this Robot to help them with their crimes

1225
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:57,679
Switching a dosa with a blouse is a cyber-crime?
There wasn't even in any curry in it!

1226
01:35:57,704 --> 01:35:58,823
I don't know all that

1227
01:35:58,905 --> 01:36:02,620
Get an undertaking from the
police that they take responsibility

1228
01:36:02,642 --> 01:36:03,760
We'll see then

1229
01:36:03,785 --> 01:36:07,034
Will they give it?
- How would I know? Ask them

1230
01:36:07,103 --> 01:36:10,071
Why is the communist party interested
in helping the damned Robot?

1231
01:36:10,129 --> 01:36:12,839
So many home nurses
are going to lose their jobs to it

1232
01:36:12,864 --> 01:36:14,263
There you are wrong

1233
01:36:14,529 --> 01:36:20,770
For issues like property disputes,
infidelity, loan-sharking etc

1234
01:36:20,795 --> 01:36:22,779
...the party has mediating for years now

1235
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:24,615
Thatâ€™s how it works here

1236
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:28,551
Sir, there is a message
from the Prime Minister's office

1237
01:36:44,934 --> 01:36:46,683
Officer!

1238
01:36:48,757 --> 01:36:53,445
Did Charles Shobaraj
use the internet to commit his crimes?

1239
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:58,249
Did Sukumara Kuruppu use
WhatsApp for his murders?

1240
01:36:59,187 --> 01:37:04,210
Did those 42 men rape that 16-year-old for
40 days in Suryanelli with the help of...

1241
01:37:04,258 --> 01:37:07,408
... Google?
Yes... Google?

1242
01:37:09,197 --> 01:37:13,195
Did Lord Krishna have 16008 wives,
because he had a Facebook account?

1243
01:37:13,479 --> 01:37:14,479
Exactly!

1244
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,909
Itâ€™s because of
your incompetence!

1245
01:37:20,934 --> 01:37:23,179
What! What did I do?

1246
01:37:29,362 --> 01:37:32,695
What kind of a brother-in-law are you?
Useless!

1247
01:37:33,538 --> 01:37:37,356
Listen... sit.
What can I get you to drink?

1248
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:39,505
I donâ€™t want anything.
- You stopped drinking?

1249
01:37:40,276 --> 01:37:41,821
The wig...

1250
01:37:42,252 --> 01:37:43,910
Why did you let it go?

1251
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:52,195
This was sent by his son.
The sanction from the PM to use the robot

1252
01:37:52,414 --> 01:37:55,288
I had no option
- Our Prime Minister?

1253
01:37:55,404 --> 01:37:59,448
Who else? Only we don't have access to him
Isn't he always abroad!

1254
01:37:59,604 --> 01:38:06,568
He signed an MoU in Japan to import
50 such Robots across the next 5 years

1255
01:38:06,593 --> 01:38:08,593
This is a trial run

1256
01:38:09,954 --> 01:38:15,227
How is that possible? Wasn't it on
a 4-month trial? You must return it

1257
01:38:15,252 --> 01:38:16,961
Sir, I'll buy it somehow

1258
01:38:17,028 --> 01:38:21,592
I can understand your situation, but that
machine isn't for sale. I could lose my job

1259
01:38:21,623 --> 01:38:23,712
This is surely the handiwork of Babu

1260
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:27,019
Now, nobody can do anything.
Let alone Babu

1261
01:38:27,383 --> 01:38:30,008
The mail my son sent was
that powerful

1262
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:33,102
Bhaskaran,
How much is your sonâ€™s salary?

1263
01:38:33,817 --> 01:38:34,910
Why?

1264
01:38:34,942 --> 01:38:36,627
It'll be fun to know

1265
01:38:36,678 --> 01:38:39,434
Knowing won't be fun.
Earning will be

1266
01:38:39,862 --> 01:38:42,087
I donâ€™t think he will return it

1267
01:38:42,112 --> 01:38:44,654
What the hell! Donâ€™t you understand?
Go, get it back

1268
01:38:44,954 --> 01:38:49,384
I need the machine back as is.
I donâ€™t care if you have to kill your father

1269
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:51,940
Hey, Chuppan stop!

1270
01:38:52,195 --> 01:38:55,170
Two out of the four machines
that went for the trial run have failed

1271
01:38:55,195 --> 01:38:59,362
If anything happens to your father,
we are done

1272
01:38:59,612 --> 01:39:01,070
I am saying this for
your own good

1273
01:39:01,112 --> 01:39:02,445
Stop it!

1274
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,805
A message from Saudamini

1275
01:39:43,062 --> 01:39:44,294
What's the message?

1276
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:46,278
"Who are you"

1277
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:47,577
Oh!

1278
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:09,886
[Message] "Thought I'd forgotten you,
memories came back when I saw you again"

1279
01:40:37,443 --> 01:40:41,203
Mr. Bhaskaran, would you like to
live in the future world?

1280
01:40:43,372 --> 01:40:46,706
Babu and Saudamini are
of the same caste

1281
01:40:46,986 --> 01:40:54,099
You hate him and love her,
which makes you a hypocrite

1282
01:40:55,416 --> 01:41:00,030
There will be no caste and religion
in the future

1283
01:41:00,112 --> 01:41:04,658
If you get rid of these thoughts, you can
live in the future already

1284
01:41:23,070 --> 01:41:37,945
â™ª â™ª

1285
01:41:39,696 --> 01:41:41,696
[NEW MESSAGE FROM SATHYAN]

1286
01:41:51,737 --> 01:41:54,837
Saudamini...
... Aren't you Saudamini?

1287
01:41:54,911 --> 01:41:56,995
Yes...
Do you remember me?

1288
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:00,654
No?
We were in the type writing class together

1289
01:42:00,986 --> 01:42:02,048
I am Sathyan

1290
01:42:02,073 --> 01:42:04,204
- Sathyan?
- Yes!

1291
01:42:04,306 --> 01:42:05,469
How have you been?

1292
01:42:05,612 --> 01:42:07,451
Well... what can I say

1293
01:42:08,256 --> 01:42:09,136
Where do you live?

1294
01:42:09,286 --> 01:42:11,522
Sathyan...
- Yes?

1295
01:42:11,881 --> 01:42:12,975
Are you on Facebook?

1296
01:42:13,077 --> 01:42:14,045
No...No

1297
01:42:15,487 --> 01:42:19,195
â™ª Come oh! my flower of memory,
Come my cute flower - â™ª

1298
01:42:19,529 --> 01:42:23,112
â™ª come secretly into my wind
of online 'chat' â™ª

1299
01:42:24,087 --> 01:42:25,087
Are they twins?

1300
01:42:25,112 --> 01:42:30,986
â™ª I have been circling the 'net' as
a beetle to kiss you, for long â™ª

1301
01:42:31,404 --> 01:42:35,112
â™ª If you come to my 'inbox' for a chat
in the evening â™ª

1302
01:42:35,779 --> 01:42:41,570
â™ª Silly girl you could be a festival of
flowers for me â™ª

1303
01:42:42,112 --> 01:42:49,217
â™ª â™ª

1304
01:42:49,404 --> 01:42:53,237
â™ª I would play the cupid for
the pooram fest â™ª

1305
01:42:53,529 --> 01:42:57,153
â™ª my dear love, you be a
red flower for me â™ª

1306
01:42:57,487 --> 01:43:01,404
â™ª don't get hung, or run low on battery â™ª

1307
01:43:01,986 --> 01:43:06,737
â™ª don't 'delete' me, saying that
your 'memory' is full â™ª

1308
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:15,362
â™ª don't shut me down either, I am the
key board on your finger tips â™ª

1309
01:43:17,661 --> 01:43:22,396
Kunjappan, when is Ekadasi
- November 8

1310
01:43:23,124 --> 01:43:26,153
At least there is someone who
still keeps track of auspicious days

1311
01:43:26,529 --> 01:43:27,867
Kunjappan,

1312
01:43:28,296 --> 01:43:29,914
Kunjappan

1313
01:43:30,445 --> 01:43:31,320
Saudamini

1314
01:43:31,529 --> 01:43:34,112
I need to ask you some thing
- OK

1315
01:43:34,237 --> 01:43:38,612
Some anonymous creep is stalking
me on the Facebook

1316
01:43:38,695 --> 01:43:41,310
Uh-Oh
- Can you find him for me?

1317
01:43:41,913 --> 01:43:45,579
The 'creep' might be some poor chap who
wants to talk to you

1318
01:43:45,695 --> 01:43:49,978
No, I have asked him several times.
He just does not say who he is

1319
01:43:49,994 --> 01:43:52,496
Just keeps flirting

1320
01:43:52,695 --> 01:43:54,737
I am thinking of reporting him to the police

1321
01:43:54,902 --> 01:43:57,075
Uh-Oh,
No need of that, he will stop

1322
01:43:58,445 --> 01:44:01,737
I still need to know who he is.
Will you please help me?

1323
01:44:02,303 --> 01:44:03,123
I will try

1324
01:44:03,444 --> 01:44:11,153
â™ª â™ª

1325
01:44:12,529 --> 01:44:16,028
Saudamini, why didnâ€™t you come to
the employment scheme meeting yesterday?

1326
01:44:16,195 --> 01:44:19,821
I was busy with some work
- Yeah, but that's there everyday

1327
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:24,986
My daughter is not well.
I need to be around the computer

1328
01:44:25,026 --> 01:44:26,455
She calls on Skype

1329
01:44:26,529 --> 01:44:28,902
Don't get too used to these things!

1330
01:44:30,945 --> 01:44:34,445
â™ª Shouldn't we go for the folk play
at Pookkom? â™ª

1331
01:44:34,612 --> 01:44:38,070
â™ª I should come with you so that
we could chat â™ª

1332
01:44:38,779 --> 01:44:45,821
â™ª If you go 'out of coverage',
I shall track you with 'GPS' â™ª

1333
01:44:46,737 --> 01:44:51,320
â™ª This is the second honeymoon,
after a secret wedding â™ª

1334
01:44:51,404 --> 01:44:56,612
â™ª I am a 'dual SIM' which suits
you-the 'handset' â™ª

1335
01:44:58,987 --> 01:44:59,737
Let's go

1336
01:45:00,737 --> 01:45:01,877
The ambience isn't right

1337
01:45:01,902 --> 01:45:05,695
â™ª I saw your 'message',
you beetle like cloud â™ª

1338
01:45:06,028 --> 01:45:09,487
â™ª you have become a 'virus' inside me â™ª

1339
01:45:09,862 --> 01:45:13,570
â™ª I shall try to 'format' and
re-'install' to cure this â™ª

1340
01:45:13,862 --> 01:45:17,445
â™ª shall search the 'recycle bin',
and 'restore' it â™ª

1341
01:45:18,153 --> 01:45:21,779
â™ª naughty lover beetle,
we have a lot to chat? â™ª

1342
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:26,153
â™ª but, do you have the youthfulness
for a life together? â™ª

1343
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:29,779
â™ª â™ª

1344
01:45:29,902 --> 01:45:31,237
Nobody is home, letâ€™s go
â™ª â™ª â™ª

1345
01:45:31,654 --> 01:45:34,779
â™ª â™ª

1346
01:45:42,793 --> 01:45:45,004
But where has she gone...

1347
01:45:45,535 --> 01:45:47,457
...without even sending a message?

1348
01:46:02,532 --> 01:46:03,342
Sorry...

1349
01:46:03,993 --> 01:46:05,077
That's my Dad

1350
01:46:05,711 --> 01:46:07,654
Papa...

1351
01:46:08,553 --> 01:46:11,537
Meet Hitomi, my friend.
We work together

1352
01:46:12,006 --> 01:46:14,732
She is a Poduval, right?
- Yes

1353
01:46:15,178 --> 01:46:16,779
So what?

1354
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:20,112
There will be no caste and religion
in the future

1355
01:46:20,237 --> 01:46:24,580
If you get rid of these thoughts, you can
live in the future already

1356
01:46:26,369 --> 01:46:28,738
How cute!

1357
01:46:28,763 --> 01:46:29,550
That room...

1358
01:46:31,882 --> 01:46:32,972
How'd you get here, suddenly?

1359
01:46:33,153 --> 01:46:36,843
Wasn't very sudden.
Took us a while to get here

1360
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:39,153
May I help you?

1361
01:46:40,404 --> 01:46:43,779
No, you have done enough and more.
I can manage it

1362
01:46:44,553 --> 01:46:46,612
Err... Let her use this room

1363
01:46:47,022 --> 01:46:47,529
Why?

1364
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:49,806
Some of my things are there

1365
01:46:50,548 --> 01:46:51,983
I'll clear those

1366
01:46:58,333 --> 01:46:59,206
Hey!

1367
01:46:59,231 --> 01:47:02,902
Donâ€™t take that
That may not fit you

1368
01:47:04,307 --> 01:47:05,529
Keep it in Dadâ€™s room

1369
01:47:06,909 --> 01:47:09,432
Dad, can I get some tea?
He can make it

1370
01:47:14,144 --> 01:47:15,278
Where are you going?

1371
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:18,683
To help him. He does not know
where the mustard seeds are

1372
01:47:18,976 --> 01:47:21,063
Why does he need Mustard seeds for tea?

1373
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,574
Donâ€™t you want Dosa?
Why'd he need them for Dosas?

1374
01:47:23,644 --> 01:47:24,962
You don't want chutney either?

1375
01:47:24,987 --> 01:47:28,476
All I asked is for tea & he'll make it.
You please sit here

1376
01:47:35,404 --> 01:47:36,153
Hmm

1377
01:47:44,061 --> 01:47:45,603
Hmm...
nice house

1378
01:48:09,099 --> 01:48:11,099
Kunjappan...

1379
01:48:30,945 --> 01:48:33,474
No messages since a week!

1380
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:34,708
Whose message?

1381
01:48:35,028 --> 01:48:42,320
Sauda... err... Karan... Saudakaran,
your maternal cousin - Sudhakaran in fact

1382
01:48:42,487 --> 01:48:44,237
He is my Facebook friend now

1383
01:48:55,253 --> 01:48:56,666
How long will you be here?

1384
01:48:57,153 --> 01:48:58,779
As long as you want

1385
01:49:01,561 --> 01:49:02,894
Wonâ€™t you lose your job?

1386
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,578
Didn't you say that
our hometown is the best

1387
01:49:10,603 --> 01:49:12,969
...and that I must stay back
and look after you

1388
01:49:14,169 --> 01:49:16,169
So I may not go back

1389
01:49:18,515 --> 01:49:19,577
Why?

1390
01:49:20,695 --> 01:49:25,454
Nowadays, it is not easy to get another job

1391
01:49:25,862 --> 01:49:27,957
Kunjappan is taking good care of me

1392
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:29,441
Right!

1393
01:49:29,801 --> 01:49:32,403
I know it is not the same
as me being here

1394
01:49:33,606 --> 01:49:34,581
Moreover...

1395
01:49:34,606 --> 01:49:38,067
...no matter who is looking after you,
I am always anxious

1396
01:49:38,259 --> 01:49:39,715
So I have decided...

1397
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:47,588
Will she go back alone?

1398
01:49:50,544 --> 01:49:52,434
She too is staying

1399
01:49:55,101 --> 01:49:57,301
We have decided to get married

1400
01:49:59,296 --> 01:50:00,903
Congratulations

1401
01:50:12,029 --> 01:50:13,038
Come

1402
01:50:13,452 --> 01:50:15,077
Why is it with you all the time?

1403
01:50:15,768 --> 01:50:17,357
Switch it off for a while

1404
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:21,109
You think its a machine
to just switch it off?

1405
01:50:24,116 --> 01:50:25,321
Let him take rest

1406
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:27,461
I want to listen to some music

1407
01:50:27,945 --> 01:50:30,320
The situation is more serious
than we thought

1408
01:50:35,193 --> 01:50:36,409
Should we just shut it down?

1409
01:50:36,434 --> 01:50:39,540
No no...
We just need to be careful

1410
01:50:40,593 --> 01:50:44,907
If we take him forcefully,
it will be a shock

1411
01:50:47,085 --> 01:50:49,544
We should convince him

1412
01:50:50,725 --> 01:50:52,545
I am sure he will understand

1413
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:55,904
He seems like a nice man.
We should be with him always

1414
01:51:08,195 --> 01:51:10,164
Hi Kunjappan!

1415
01:51:27,821 --> 01:51:30,187
Who is this?
Is this a new Robot?

1416
01:51:30,655 --> 01:51:32,394
She is my friend

1417
01:51:45,687 --> 01:51:46,890
Thank you

1418
01:51:52,529 --> 01:51:56,446
Mr. Bhaskaran,
we need to talk in private

1419
01:51:56,775 --> 01:51:57,999
What?

1420
01:51:58,906 --> 01:52:02,804
Something he hasn't even told his son

1421
01:52:02,843 --> 01:52:03,935
I need to use the loo

1422
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,100
What?
- The toilet...

1423
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:10,939
Come... I need to use it
Good bye, Subramaniyan

1424
01:52:14,404 --> 01:52:17,649
This is what I was telling you about.
I think he is losing his mind

1425
01:52:19,011 --> 01:52:21,598
In 35 years, I don't think he
even prayed for me once

1426
01:52:21,623 --> 01:52:23,990
And he has gotten
its horoscope checked

1427
01:52:24,953 --> 01:52:27,624
Well, no point blaming him

1428
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:31,720
Who gives an old man
such a toy?

1429
01:52:38,763 --> 01:52:42,638
Babu, I am thirsty!
- You just had a drink

1430
01:52:44,304 --> 01:52:46,436
Thirsty for revenge, you fool!
- Oh

1431
01:52:49,789 --> 01:52:51,464
I will finish off that
bloody Kunjappan

1432
01:52:53,612 --> 01:52:57,052
That very name drives me crazy

1433
01:53:00,626 --> 01:53:02,631
"New voice message"

1434
01:53:02,994 --> 01:53:04,703
I moved out of Payyannur

1435
01:53:04,986 --> 01:53:06,737
They have plans to rebuild that house

1436
01:53:07,525 --> 01:53:09,515
Could not tell you as I was in a hurry

1437
01:53:09,839 --> 01:53:12,234
I knew you will find out anyway

1438
01:53:23,817 --> 01:53:24,944
Kunjappan...

1439
01:53:26,312 --> 01:53:29,133
Why have they come now...
Chuppan and that Hitachi...?

1440
01:53:29,158 --> 01:53:30,164
Hitomi

1441
01:53:30,222 --> 01:53:33,356
Whatever! I don't care.
She is not your mother right!

1442
01:53:33,381 --> 01:53:35,381
Why are they here?

1443
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:36,467
No idea

1444
01:53:56,039 --> 01:53:57,039
Hi..

1445
01:54:09,323 --> 01:54:10,760
What are you doing here?

1446
01:54:11,205 --> 01:54:13,510
I am going to cook from today

1447
01:54:18,387 --> 01:54:19,571
Not just cooking...

1448
01:54:19,629 --> 01:54:21,778
I am going to be
taking care of you from now on

1449
01:54:27,018 --> 01:54:29,577
I need half a glass of tea

1450
01:54:41,099 --> 01:54:42,584
I told you half a glass

1451
01:54:44,322 --> 01:54:46,211
You drink whatever
quantity you want

1452
01:54:46,813 --> 01:54:51,075
Whatever I want, is what I asked for
Couldn't you give me just that?

1453
01:54:56,487 --> 01:54:57,641
Come...

1454
01:55:02,278 --> 01:55:04,529
Where are you going?
- I need to bathe

1455
01:55:05,236 --> 01:55:06,644
What do you need him for?

1456
01:55:06,737 --> 01:55:09,978
Should I go alone? What if something
happens to me there!

1457
01:55:10,627 --> 01:55:12,085
You stay here,
I'll come with you

1458
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:15,361
You stay here

1459
01:55:20,153 --> 01:55:22,216
Grated coconut is kept
on the counter

1460
01:55:22,241 --> 01:55:24,043
The grinding stone is
outside, grind it well

1461
01:55:24,191 --> 01:55:25,565
Only then it tastes well

1462
01:55:25,695 --> 01:55:27,567
Mustard seeds should
be fried properly

1463
01:55:27,592 --> 01:55:29,025
But don't burn it either

1464
01:55:30,713 --> 01:55:31,720
Come

1465
01:55:40,475 --> 01:55:42,433
Hey, where are both you going?

1466
01:55:42,955 --> 01:55:44,214
I am going to have a bath

1467
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:46,276
He is coming along to wipe my head.
Got a problem?

1468
01:55:46,307 --> 01:55:47,617
Nothing, I was just asking

1469
01:55:49,856 --> 01:55:51,861
Why are you trying to embarrass me?

1470
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:53,376
Embarrass you?

1471
01:55:53,525 --> 01:55:56,157
If thatâ€™s the case, having wiped
your head for 10-12 years...

1472
01:55:56,243 --> 01:55:58,922
I should have died of embarrassment

1473
01:56:15,696 --> 01:56:20,834
Where does he get the money to buy
new robots every week?

1474
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:27,798
Is the Robot on leave today?

1475
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:03,171
Who did you say made this?

1476
01:57:03,612 --> 01:57:04,612
Hitomi

1477
01:57:06,529 --> 01:57:08,663
Do you think Iâ€™m I am a fool?

1478
01:57:09,426 --> 01:57:10,426
Huh?

1479
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:15,664
That piece of metal scrap took care of me,
for the last 3-4 months

1480
01:57:17,423 --> 01:57:18,954
Despite all my antics,

1481
01:57:18,979 --> 01:57:23,772
...he fed me, he bathed me, made me laugh

1482
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:27,712
Never disobeyed me
or talked back to me

1483
01:57:29,779 --> 01:57:32,622
...nor did it scare me, till now

1484
01:57:36,362 --> 01:57:40,588
Didnâ€™t you tell me to treat it
as a child and teach it everything?

1485
01:57:40,696 --> 01:57:43,645
When you went abroad...

1486
01:57:44,028 --> 01:57:47,195
...it was he who made me
feel alive

1487
01:57:51,741 --> 01:57:53,508
For you...

1488
01:57:53,713 --> 01:57:57,395
he might be just a machine
that does household chores

1489
01:57:58,070 --> 01:58:00,013
but for me he is my son

1490
01:58:04,902 --> 01:58:06,834
If he goes, who will stay here?

1491
01:58:06,884 --> 01:58:08,884
Hitomi?

1492
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:11,100
You?

1493
01:58:13,737 --> 01:58:18,902
Since how many years have I been asking you
to immerse your Mother's ashes?

1494
01:58:20,132 --> 01:58:21,132
hmm?

1495
01:58:22,779 --> 01:58:25,695
If you donâ€™t even have time for that,
how will you look after me?

1496
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:31,779
Even if you stay here...

1497
01:58:33,726 --> 01:58:35,984
and If I became
bedridden...

1498
01:58:36,009 --> 01:58:38,593
you wouldn't even be able to
clean out my crap

1499
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:43,963
You will find another home nurse

1500
01:58:48,779 --> 01:58:52,509
I call you to play chess
so we can have a conversation

1501
01:58:54,695 --> 01:58:57,117
but you have a problem
with that too

1502
01:59:02,027 --> 01:59:03,976
I am not saying these to make you cry

1503
01:59:07,362 --> 01:59:11,158
He cannot replace you...

1504
01:59:11,192 --> 01:59:15,751
...neither can you replace him

1505
01:59:37,237 --> 01:59:38,310
Hey!

1506
01:59:40,362 --> 01:59:41,451
You...!

1507
01:59:41,612 --> 01:59:46,153
What are you doing Dad?

1508
01:59:46,241 --> 01:59:48,458
Look what she is doing!

1509
01:59:48,483 --> 01:59:50,678
Dad, stop it
No, I won't!

1510
01:59:50,737 --> 01:59:53,331
No matter what you
say, we need to return it

1511
01:59:53,356 --> 01:59:54,845
We were given
it for four months

1512
01:59:54,902 --> 01:59:55,902
We canâ€™t keep it any more

1513
01:59:56,028 --> 01:59:58,153
Neither the government,
nor the company will allow it

1514
01:59:58,178 --> 01:59:59,504
I don't have
the permission for it

1515
01:59:59,529 --> 02:00:03,069
All the other robots from
this batch have failed

1516
02:00:03,094 --> 02:00:05,624
This will harm you for sure

1517
02:00:05,858 --> 02:00:08,765
So many fathers have been
murdered by their children

1518
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:11,538
Does that stop anyone
from being a parent?

1519
02:00:11,695 --> 02:00:12,777
Does it?

1520
02:00:12,802 --> 02:00:14,587
Do you value this machine more than me?

1521
02:00:14,612 --> 02:00:18,529
When did I ignore you, Dad?

1522
02:00:18,841 --> 02:00:22,250
When I was idling away here with you,
Have you shown this affection to me?

1523
02:00:22,275 --> 02:00:24,915
This machine will definitely kill you Dad

1524
02:00:27,142 --> 02:00:30,768
He wonâ€™t do any harm to me.
Itâ€™s only in your imagination

1525
02:00:30,821 --> 02:00:33,833
Papa, please understand

1526
02:00:34,153 --> 02:00:37,577
This is only a machine
programmed by somebody

1527
02:00:38,099 --> 02:00:39,926
This is not like us, humans

1528
02:00:40,889 --> 02:00:42,236
Arenâ€™t we the same?

1529
02:00:42,519 --> 02:00:44,541
Programmed by someone!

1530
02:00:44,566 --> 02:00:46,257
I call it destiny

1531
02:00:46,737 --> 02:00:49,404
you call it programming or
whatever the hell you like

1532
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:51,908
We left everything behind
to come and look after you

1533
02:00:51,986 --> 02:00:54,746
I have to return it.
Or none of us will be at peace

1534
02:00:54,902 --> 02:00:57,359
I can be arrested. This is a criminal case

1535
02:00:57,467 --> 02:01:01,275
I will live with you forever.
Is that not enough?

1536
02:01:24,362 --> 02:01:26,445
Good Morning, Mr.Bhaskaran

1537
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:31,493
Itâ€™s 7.30 AM, time for your breakfast

1538
02:02:41,028 --> 02:02:43,291
Hitomi, when are you coming back?

1539
02:02:44,377 --> 02:02:46,601
He is not willing to give it back

1540
02:02:47,237 --> 02:02:51,290
Check your email. Shut the machine off
immediately, his father is in danger

1541
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:14,404
Dad... Dad...

1542
02:03:46,321 --> 02:03:47,528
Tickets...

1543
02:03:50,422 --> 02:03:52,006
Did you get a ticket?

1544
02:03:54,265 --> 02:03:56,307
Kunjappan is also missing.
You come fast

1545
02:03:56,529 --> 02:03:59,246
I saw them yesterday
Father and son, on the way to the pond

1546
02:03:59,445 --> 02:04:03,922
Did you call Subramaniyan?
He went out on the bike, not picking up now

1547
02:04:10,028 --> 02:04:13,505
Adukkumala, Adukkumala...
Those who are going to Chamundikkavu...

1548
02:04:13,651 --> 02:04:15,614
This is your stop
Get down, fast

1549
02:04:20,028 --> 02:04:22,028
Would the old man have
fallen into this well?

1550
02:04:22,153 --> 02:04:25,031
Itâ€™s the old government well, right?
There is no water in it

1551
02:04:25,149 --> 02:04:27,550
If there is no water, itâ€™s no well,
just a pit

1552
02:04:27,654 --> 02:04:28,986
Are you not coming?

1553
02:04:29,237 --> 02:04:31,332
The search would
have been interesting at night

1554
02:04:31,357 --> 02:04:32,812
with flashlights and all

1555
02:04:32,836 --> 02:04:34,891
this being in the day...
its no fun

1556
02:04:34,916 --> 02:04:37,408
You go ahead
I'll join you guys later

1557
02:05:04,028 --> 02:05:07,093
Its deserted
Not even an insect is around

1558
02:05:09,529 --> 02:05:11,604
A call from Subramaniyan

1559
02:05:16,662 --> 02:05:17,664
Switch it off

1560
02:05:17,862 --> 02:05:19,964
Calling facility disabled

1561
02:05:30,654 --> 02:05:32,351
Come this way

1562
02:05:51,397 --> 02:05:52,898
Where are we going?

1563
02:05:53,263 --> 02:05:56,949
Nowhere... where can this possibly lead to

1564
02:05:57,710 --> 02:06:00,788
We can live here in the forest
like the tribals

1565
02:06:02,479 --> 02:06:06,145
There is enough here for two to survive
without having to work

1566
02:06:07,237 --> 02:06:11,838
After all, I have lived an entire life
without working

1567
02:06:15,413 --> 02:06:17,995
Itâ€™s time for your medicines
- Hmm

1568
02:06:30,902 --> 02:06:32,779
Now nobody will notice you

1569
02:06:44,378 --> 02:06:45,592
Hold these

1570
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:14,320
Chamundikaavu, the temple the astrologer
suggested is somewhere here

1571
02:07:15,167 --> 02:07:16,896
You run a search

1572
02:07:18,112 --> 02:07:22,874
We need to offer
some special prayers for you

1573
02:07:22,942 --> 02:07:24,942
I had planned to do it

1574
02:07:26,278 --> 02:07:29,986
After that we head to the seaside

1575
02:07:30,404 --> 02:07:32,921
On her deathbed, my wife asked me...

1576
02:07:34,425 --> 02:07:37,364
...to get her son to scatter her remains

1577
02:07:40,153 --> 02:07:43,070
Even after all these years,
I could never make that happen

1578
02:07:45,487 --> 02:07:48,464
My dad told me the same
before he passed away

1579
02:07:50,214 --> 02:07:55,483
Anyway you'll will go to immerse her ashes,
take mine along as well

1580
02:08:04,455 --> 02:08:08,344
The wishes of the dead
are a joke to those alive

1581
02:08:10,986 --> 02:08:15,013
Nobody is going to come back checking
if they were carried out

1582
02:08:15,273 --> 02:08:18,481
Battery low, need to recharge
- Oh!

1583
02:08:34,449 --> 02:08:36,695
A message from Saudamini

1584
02:08:41,654 --> 02:08:43,195
Opening voice message

1585
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:50,417
Hello! Long time, no see!
Have you forgotten me?

1586
02:08:55,112 --> 02:08:57,639
How could I!

1587
02:08:59,104 --> 02:09:06,086
We... are coming to you

1588
02:09:10,424 --> 02:09:14,842
Mr. Bhaskaran, why didnâ€™t you
marry Saudamini?

1589
02:09:15,184 --> 02:09:17,184
Saudamini...

1590
02:09:17,654 --> 02:09:19,821
I didn't have the
courage to face her

1591
02:09:21,508 --> 02:09:25,350
This courage that I have now,
I didn't have back then

1592
02:09:25,489 --> 02:09:30,223
The moment I told my parents about her,
my father packed me off to Vadakara

1593
02:09:30,645 --> 02:09:31,706
Phew!

1594
02:09:31,807 --> 02:09:35,398
I had to live there for some years,
looking after our land and crops

1595
02:09:35,487 --> 02:09:38,256
During that time, she married someone else

1596
02:09:38,803 --> 02:09:42,748
And when I was ready for marriage,
they got me married too

1597
02:09:43,921 --> 02:09:45,921
I eventually forgot her

1598
02:09:49,862 --> 02:09:52,665
Love is like that

1599
02:09:52,690 --> 02:09:55,469
If not maintained well...

1600
02:09:55,986 --> 02:10:02,561
...it will crumble down like
an abandoned house

1601
02:10:03,635 --> 02:10:08,464
You wonâ€™t understand all that
You are not old enough for that

1602
02:10:10,986 --> 02:10:13,404
Yes, I would not understand

1603
02:10:19,654 --> 02:10:24,492
I am programmed only to assist you

1604
02:10:26,529 --> 02:10:28,971
I am not a human

1605
02:10:33,195 --> 02:10:34,278
Get lost you!

1606
02:10:35,815 --> 02:10:37,815
What Subramaniyan said is right

1607
02:10:38,265 --> 02:10:41,307
They will find me no matter
where we go hiding

1608
02:10:41,737 --> 02:10:45,153
They will take me back and
erase my memories

1609
02:10:51,404 --> 02:10:54,223
What good are we
without our memories?

1610
02:10:54,798 --> 02:10:58,041
Like a vehicle without fuel
that is left in a corner

1611
02:10:59,649 --> 02:11:02,361
New memories will be installed

1612
02:11:03,162 --> 02:11:06,598
I am but a trial run

1613
02:11:07,261 --> 02:11:10,920
They will take me back to fix the
bugs and errors

1614
02:11:13,239 --> 02:11:15,832
I don't understand love

1615
02:11:16,065 --> 02:11:21,126
I should not be loved
I am a machine

1616
02:11:22,884 --> 02:11:26,204
You can leave me here
and go go back

1617
02:11:28,503 --> 02:11:33,545
I am a device built by humans
to simplify their tasks

1618
02:11:34,058 --> 02:11:36,432
I cannot replace them

1619
02:11:36,457 --> 02:11:38,249
I do not have emotions

1620
02:11:39,513 --> 02:11:42,981
Mortal remains are just ash for me

1621
02:12:04,964 --> 02:12:09,175
You are crazy

1622
02:12:37,092 --> 02:12:39,009
Dad...!

1623
02:12:41,667 --> 02:12:45,043
Dad, what is this?
What are you doing? Stop it

1624
02:12:45,592 --> 02:12:48,800
Uh-oh
Harmful objects detected

1625
02:12:49,593 --> 02:12:53,402
You and your helmet.
Whom are you planning to kill here?

1626
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:56,276
I am going to rip your head off!

1627
02:12:56,301 --> 02:12:59,342
Arghh...

1628
02:12:59,717 --> 02:13:02,092
Activating self-protection mode

1629
02:14:31,758 --> 02:14:35,675
We are coming to you

1630
02:14:37,301 --> 02:14:42,217
I donâ€™t think...

1631
02:14:46,671 --> 02:14:50,016
[NEW MESSAGE]
"I don't think you can find me"

1632
02:15:35,175 --> 02:15:38,371
Kunjappan...!
