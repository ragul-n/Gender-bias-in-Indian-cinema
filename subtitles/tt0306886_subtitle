00:00:00,000 --> 00:02:26,240
[Subtitle by Vishu]

2
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,600
All the world's a stage.

3
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,460
All the people are characters in it.

4
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,580
Is it not?

5
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,680
Birth and death...

6
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,400
To face the challenges in the life between...

7
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,790
Man does many things...

8
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,170
Puts different clothes on...

9
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,170
Plays different roles...

10
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,710
He lies...

11
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,280
Why do all this?

12
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,470
To fill one's stomach...

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,180
and to clothe oneself.

14
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,950
This world where one thinks, 'I shall live and I only, shall live'...

15
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,380
the one with intelligence and power rises...

16
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,710
and the one without, perishes.

17
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,600
In a world filled with such competition,

18
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,670
with only his intelligence...

19
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,080
and making an easy living by tricking and hoodwinking others...

20
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,960
this Lambodhara survives and is our story's protagonist.

21
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,160
Hear him tell you who a smart man is.

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,490
One who spins a top without a string is a smart man.

23
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,610
Anyone can spin a top given the string.

24
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,250
Now see, I have to go to Chamarajapet.

25
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,670
Bus fare is one rupee.

26
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,180
An auto rickshaw ride would cost me ten rupees.

27
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,360
I don't have even a cent in my pocket.

28
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,490
Still I'll manage to go to Chamarajapet.

29
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,490
And I wouldn't even consider walking. That doesn't suit me.

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,950
Then how will I go there?

31
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,020
Keep watching.

32
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,380
Will you take me to Chamarajapet?
No.

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
Hello.
Hello.

34
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,390
Going to Chamarajapet?
Yes. Why do you ask?

35
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,390
I too am going there.

36
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,510
If one travels in an auto, it would cost 10-12 rupees.

37
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,300
If we go together, we can share.

38
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,720
Why not? I too save 6 rupees. Good idea.

39
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,020
One minute, I'll bring my friend too.
OK.

40
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,330
Curse these autos. No one's willing to go.

41
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,820
Where are you going, sir?

42
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Chamarajapet, sir.
You're alone?
Yes.

43
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
I'll bring an auto and take you to Chamarajapet in 6 rupees.
6 rupees? How?

44
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,880
I have a friend there.

45
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
We shall share the fare. 50-50?

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,750
Why not? I'll save 6 rupees, good idea.
Yes, good idea. I'll just come back.

47
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,180
Your name?
M.Kumar. Yours?
Lambodhar.

48
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,940
Wait here, I'll bring the auto.
OK sir.

49
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,140
Will you take me to Chamarajapet?
Yes.

50
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,690
We are 3 people.
That's OK. Please come.

51
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,230
Hey, you can finish your cigarette.

52
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,590
Just stop here.

53
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,590
Please come sir.

54
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,730
Hey Kumar.

55
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,470
Kumar, six rupees.

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,160
Six rupees.

57
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,430
Stop here, I'll get down.

58
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,420
Here?

59
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,450
My house is close by.

60
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,660
I would've dropped you near home.
That's OK, I'll walk.

61
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,400
Stop, I'll get down here.

62
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,560
Why sir? We could've...

63
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,930
No, the road is narrow. Auto can't turn back.

64
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,590
OK.

65
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,800
Right.

66
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,510
That's enough, stop here.

67
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,650
How much is it?

68
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,680
10 rupees 30 paise.

69
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,130
Ten rupees.

70
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,500
30 Paise...

71
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
Do you have change for a 100?

72
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,980
It's Ok leave it sir.

73
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
What is this, Lambodhara?

74
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,680
Whenever I ask, you tell me that you didn't get a job...

75
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,250
or don't have any money.

76
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,730
But still travel in auto rickshaws.

77
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,350
I can't understand your ways.

78
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,140
One need not have money in his pocket to travel in an auto.

79
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,760
Intelligence in brain is enough.

80
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,720
Poor fellows who paid for the auto got down in the middle and walked home.

81
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,040
I, who didn't pay, rode on the auto till home.

82
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,120
Over that...

83
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,970
2 rupees net profit.

84
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,970
This is Lambodhara's technique.

85
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,470
You're impossible man.

86
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,140
That's OK but what have you planned for the evening?

87
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,100
Evening?

88
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,140
Why?

89
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,720
House owner will come asking for the rent.

90
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,450
Last time, you somehow sweet talked and drove him away.

91
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,660
But this time nothing's going to work.

92
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,030
He'll throw you out and insult you.

93
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,510
Is that all? I'll give him the rent.

94
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,630
But you say you don't have any money?
I'll earn some.

95
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,560
How's that?

96
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,820
Keep watching.

97
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,960
[Prop: Shrinivas Shetty]

98
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,150
Namaskara, Shrinivas Shetty.

99
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm not Shrinivas Shetty but his son Panduranga Shetty.

100
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,530
Where's Shrinivas Shetty?

101
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Look there.

102
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,160
He left all of us.

103
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,680
When?

104
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,420
It's written there itself.

105
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,030
On first?

106
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,440
He was with me the previous day.

107
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,920
Sipping coffee in Hotel Parag, he told me...

108
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,650
'This business might probably end with me.'

109
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,480
'My son Panduranga doesn't have the smartness to run the business.'

110
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,390
I consoled him.

111
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,550
I told him,'Shetty, everyone's like that in the beginning.'

112
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,400
'And would learn the business once they start working.'

113
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,750
Didn't expect things to turn so bad this soon.

114
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,980
That coffee was the last coffee of our friendship.

115
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,490
Oh god.

116
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,490
Forget it. What can anyone do?

117
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,040
All these relations and friendships lasts only till the fate allows.

118
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,760
OK.

119
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,690
Take this, Shetty.

120
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,650
2 rupees.

121
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,770
What do you want?

122
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,100
Nothing.

123
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,440
I came back to clear the accounts.

124
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,600
On 17th, I had bought some items from your father.

125
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,390
I had paid 70 rupees and I owed 2 rupees balance.

126
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,250
Suddenly, I had this urgent work in Kumbakonam and I went.

127
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,100
I came today.

128
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,910
Thought I'll meet your father and...

129
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,910
pay the balance, But here...

130
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,930
Oh, it's only 2 rupees.

131
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,360
No, I'll be content only when I've repaid my dues.

132
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,600
I'll Leave.
Don't stop coming because my father died.
No,no.
Keep coming.

133
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,460
OK, I'll keep coming.
What an honest man. Because of people like him, there's plenty rain and bountiful harvest.

134
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,050
One can easily give things on credit to people like him.

135
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,980
Give me a Pears soap.
Hey, give one Pears soap.

136
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,810
Hearing Shetty's death...

137
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,560
I forgot.
What do you want?

138
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,350
One Surf packet.
Hey, give sir a Surf packet.

139
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,890
And then a Horlicks bottle.

140
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,400
Small or large?

141
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,340
Give a large one.

142
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,150
Pack a large Horlicks bottle.

143
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,540
With that, 2 vermicelli packets, 1 Lifebuoy soap.

144
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,210
And a Parachute coconut oil bottle.

145
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,740
and 10 Eclair chocolates.

146
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,160
If you have a bag, please put them in that.
OK,OK.

147
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,700
How much is it?

148
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
159.

149
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,760
Oh, all my money is in my pant and I've come here wearing pyjama. I'll just come back with the money.

150
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,550
No problem. Take this with you.

151
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,610
You can pay when you come back.

152
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,080
I don't like debts.

153
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,800
How long can it take to bring the money? I'll be back in a jiffy.

154
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,600
Oh, that's alright. You take this.

155
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,240
Take this with you.

156
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,440
Many thanks.

157
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,910
I'll come back with the money.

158
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,440
Ok.

159
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,640
What is it Puttajji? Where are you going?

160
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,320
It's my fate.

161
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,260
Though there are children and grandchildren at home,

162
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,400
I still have to do all the chores.

163
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,840
Oh, What did you want?

164
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,580
One surf packet.
That's all? Take this.

165
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,440
You needn't drag your feet to the shop for that. Give me 32 rupees.

166
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
Here's 35 rupees.

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
I'll give back the change later.

168
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,620
May god bless you.

169
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,880
What Ratnakar? Where are you going?

170
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,820
I was going to buy a Horlicks bottle and Parachute coconut oil.

171
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,490
This is what you want?
Yes.

172
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,310
105 rupees.

173
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,090
You seem to have opened a mobile provision store?

174
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,470
I just wanted to help my neighbours. That's all.

175
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,650
What help can you do for me Lambodhar?
For you...A Lifebuoy?

176
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,710
Lifebuoy soap. 5 rupees.

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,950
Lambu uncle..
Yes your Lambu uncle has brought you toffees. Have them.

178
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,540
Where did the other one go? Ah, here it is. Give me a kiss.

179
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,990
Venkamma.

180
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,840
You were scolding your husband for not bringing vermicelli, right?

181
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,420
Take this.
How did you know?

182
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,160
Oh, won't I know what goes on in every household in this neighbourhood? 15 rupees.

183
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,770
And for the toffees you gave to the children?
I gave that for the love of children. Your children are like mine, right?
What?

184
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,860
I mean all the children in the neighbourhood are like my own.

185
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Take this change.

186
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,060
Let that house owner come.

187
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,800
As soon as the bell is rung, everyone comes to me and pay their rent.

188
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,700
This Lambodhara is an exception.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,070
Lambodhara... Lambodhara...

190
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,910
Please come sir.

191
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,370
I was waiting for you.
Stop lying.

192
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,940
When I asked for rent last month,

193
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,040
you said you'd pay two months rent together.

194
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,500
Pay the rent.
I never said I wouldn't pay.

195
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,060
You never said that but you aren't paying too.

196
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,650
Sir, I'm an unemployed well past the age limit for employment.

197
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,840
Wait for two months.

198
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,190
I'll pay your rent.
You have to pay me today.

199
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,850
Or else vacate the house.

200
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,120
Do you understand?
Yes sir.

201
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,560
I had some 150 rupees for food.

202
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,960
I'll give that.

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,570
Yes, give that.
And I'll bear the starvation that awaits me.

204
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,230
Sir.

205
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,230
My name is Jnaanamurthy, sir.

206
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,230
I'm managing my studies with the help of charity sir.

207
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,230
I have to pay this year's school fees, sir.

208
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm poor sir.

209
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,840
I want to study more.

210
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,470
I'm going to everyone's house and seeking help.

211
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,470
Please help me with whatever money you can, sir.

212
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,240
I'm poor sir. Please help me sir.

213
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,290
If I don't pay the fees, all my efforts this year will be in vain sir.

214
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,000
How much do you have to pay?
150 rupees sir.

215
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,760
Sir, I can't bear to watch someone struggling for their studies.

216
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
I just give whatever I have on hand. Take this boy.

217
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,260
Just study well and come back and tell me that passed with good grade. That's all I want in return.

218
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,360
I couldn't hold myself after hearing his story, sir.

219
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,110
I gave him the money.

220
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
I'll arrange the money for you next month.

221
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,980
If it's OK with you, fine.

222
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,880
Otherwise you take the money back I gave that boy yourself. I can't do that.

223
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,090
Lambodhara...

224
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,000
I didn't know your heart was so big.

225
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,510
Why would I take the money back from that boy?

226
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,600
That's alright. Next month you can pay me three months' rent together.
OK sir.

227
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,270
Boy Jnaanamurthy...

228
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,360
Take the blessing of the elder.
Get up boy.

229
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,750
Get up. Get up.

230
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,960
Become a learned man.

231
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll leave sir. I won't forget your help sir.

232
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,890
OK.

233
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,030
I'll also leave Lambodhara.
OK sir.

234
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,510
Take this boss, your 150 rupees.

235
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,890
You acted well. Take this, enjoy.

236
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,680
I have to maintain the trust with Shetty.

237
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,380
I had only 100 rupees in my pants.

238
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,510
Balance?
That's alright, you can pay me later.

239
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,510
Can I take read this paper?
Take it.

240
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,120
Reporters are wanted for 'Vishala Karnataka' newspaper.

241
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,750
Preference will be given to those with camera.

242
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,160
So many cameras are rotting in the showroom.

243
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,760
If only I could have one, my job will be guaranteed.

244
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,080
Namaskara sir.

245
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,370
Please come Mr.Damodar.

246
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,480
Have you got my camera?

247
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,620
Cameras will be ready as soon as you give an order is given in our shop.
Very good.

248
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,780
Look here. Bring him his camera.

249
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,780
Not now. I'll send someone called Vishwanath. You can give it to him.

250
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,160
How will I identify him?
He'll mention my name.

251
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,040
He'll ask for the camera and...

252
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,600
he'll ask for Bombay air tickets too.

253
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,450
You give him these air tickets and tell him to leave the camera at my home.

254
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,690
I have to go somewhere urgently. I'll leave.

255
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,610
Namaskara.
Namaskara.
I'm Vishwanath.

256
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,800
Damodar sent me.

257
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,950
Will you give me the camera?

258
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,380
How will I believe that you're Vishwanath?

259
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,380
No need.

260
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,310
I need only the air tickets urgently.

261
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,590
That is enough.

262
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,660
Give him.

263
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,480
Take this.
Thank you.

264
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,540
Take this.
You'll give the camera too?

265
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,320
I just wanted to confirm that you are Vishwanath. That's why I asked. Please don't mind.
No.no.

266
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,560
Please tell him that I would've delivered the camera to his home.

267
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,720
And also please tell him that it'll be 15 days before I return from Bombay. I'll Leave.
Namaskara.

268
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,710
Oh, so you're Vishwanath?

270
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,770
Mr.Damodar had come to our shop. This is our shop.

271
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,240
He said Vishwanath would come here to collect the air tickets. Take these.

272
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,690
He took the camera.

273
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,840
I don't have to make a trip to his home.

274
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,990
You're going to Bombay? Happy Landing.

275
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,240
Namaskara, Editor.
Namaskara.

276
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,870
Please sit down.
Thank you.

277
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,100
Your name?

278
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,370
Varun Shourie.
Oh.

279
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,330
Do you have any experience reporting for the newspapers?

280
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,630
Why wouldn't I have sir?

281
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,160
I'm Arun Shourie's cousin.

282
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,580
All the sensational news written in his name...

283
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,640
...are actually written by me. What does he know about reporting sir?

284
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,510
You mean you write all the articles in his name?

285
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,920
Why don't you write them in your name?

286
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,630
That's all politics, sir.

287
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,260
Some trade secrets can't be revealed just like that.

288
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,590
But if you appoint me and later we become close...

289
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,820
I can tell you some off the record secrets.

290
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,840
Really? Then you're a very interesting person.

291
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,050
Do you have camera?
I do sir.

292
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:30,640
I have captured countless scandals on this camera. This is my luckiest camera, sir.

293
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
You give me an opportunity sir.

294
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,100
Unearthing new scandals everyday and writing relentless articles on them...

295
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I will make your 'Vishala Karnataka' newspaper reach the whole of India sir.

296
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,560
Very good, very good. You're appointed.

297
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Success!

298
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,110
I can win this world with just my words.

299
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,620
I can spin a top without a string.

300
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:10,580
Would I let go the ones who get caught in my web?

301
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,590
I can mesmerise and survive.

302
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,740
I can win a free lunch.

303
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,030
This is a ripe time for lies and schemes.

304
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,500
I know the minds of crooked people.

305
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,680
I can throw dust in their eyes.

306
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,160
My bait awaits those who are stupid.

307
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,260
Cheating begets cheating.

308
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,510
Hatred begets hatred.

309
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,840
I'll reveal the truth of your lives.

310
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,620
I can win this world with just my words.

311
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,000
I can spin a top without a string.

312
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:51,280
Would I let go the ones who get caught in my web?

313
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,120
Cheating is not my aim.

314
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,440
I won't leave if you're asking for it.

315
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,040
You won't get to see another smart one like me.

316
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,290
I'm the only name for cheating.

317
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,750
Intelligent is this Lambodhara.

318
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,300
A smart man can thrive anywhere.

319
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,560
I wait for my chance, jump on the opportunity...

320
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,980
and snatch as much as I can.

321
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,440
I can win this world with just my words.

322
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,720
I can spin a top without a string.

323
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:23,380
Would I let go the ones who get caught in my web?

324
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,140
Come come.

325
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,000
How's my camera working?
How will it work?

326
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You didn't give camera to Vishwanath.

327
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,460
You gave him only the air tickets and told him that I took the camera home.
Who told you so?

328
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,110
I gave him the camera myself.

329
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,620
What man?
I gave him the camera only when he asked for Bombay air tickets.

330
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,060
But Vishwanath also wouldn't lie to me.

331
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,340
Is this the person to whom you gave the camera?

332
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,000
As I remember, this is not that person. You look.

333
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,780
Definitely it's not him.

334
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,140
But he told everything you said he'd say.

335
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,630
Looks like we've been cheated.

336
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,910
You don't worry.

337
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,910
Come what may, I'll catch that thief.

338
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,910
You're most lucky Mr.Varun Shourie.

339
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,290
Today, there's a function at our proprietor's house.

340
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,290
Lots of VIPs are coming.

341
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,020
He wants photo coverage done.

342
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,160
I've told him that I'll send you.

343
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,530
Go and take some first class photos.

344
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,860
Then you can become close to him.
Thank you sir.

345
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,010
Thank you very much.

346
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,080
Namaskara, please come.

347
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,430
I'm Varun Shourie.
Oh!

348
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,880
So, it's you. Nice to have seen you.

349
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,280
Please come. But please forgive me.
Why?

350
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,440
It's not right to use you for my personal work.

351
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,550
But our editor told me that you're a very good photographer and reporter.

352
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,080
That's why I called you.
It's my privilege sir.

353
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,420
Thank you very much sir.

354
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,560
It's late. Don't know what he'll say.

355
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,650
Come man come.

356
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,280
How can you come late like some VIP?

357
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,970
Had trouble with the car.
Anyway, welcome.

358
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,400
I'll introduce you to a VVIP.
Would you?

359
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,450
You go inside.

360
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,950
Sir.

361
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,070
This is my brother.

362
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,170
Nagesh.

363
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,550
He owns a camera shop.

364
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,440
Thank you.

365
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,280
You know who he is?

366
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,060
Arun Shourie's cousin Varun Shourie.

367
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,430
He's newly appointed to my press.

368
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,470
Hello sir.

369
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,470
You scoundrel.

370
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,200
I caught you now.

371
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
At last I'm caught now.

372
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
I must take the camera and throw him out.

373
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,400
He may take the camera, should I make a run for it?

374
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,120
No, not in front of my brother.

375
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,680
I'll deal with him later.

376
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
No, let me not run away.

377
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,250
I'm caught anyway. Let's see what happens.

378
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,250
Why do you stand so surprised?

379
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,310
Are you dumbstruck that you met such a celebrity?

380
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,550
Hello, Prithviraj.
Oh, hello sir.

381
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,390
Look here.

382
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,390
I'm telling you nicely.

383
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,030
Give me the camera and leave.

384
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,030
Or else I'll tell my brother.

385
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,030
He's short tempered.

386
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,030
I'll make a scene by telling him.

387
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,350
If you don't want to lose your honour, give me the camera.

388
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,920
Ah, It's you?
Sir.

389
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,620
Sir.

390
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,860
Sir, please stand at one place.

391
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,020
I didn't get time to speak to you yesterday.

392
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,850
So, I got your address from the editor and came straight to you.

393
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,680
Please sir. Please sit down.

394
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,480
And please listen to me peacefully. You too sit down boys.

395
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,210
Who is this? Whats going on?

396
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,600
He's a cheat.

397
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,940
Sir, I've not come to cheat you.

398
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,540
I came to explain my situation and ask for forgiveness.

399
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,960
What is so bad about your situation?

400
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
Poverty is very bad sir.

401
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,220
I'm a photographer sir.

402
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,740
I had a small studio.

403
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,560
Because it was a small town, the business was average.

404
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,360
I was managing somehow.

405
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
I lost my mother while young sir.

406
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,030
There was no woman in my home.

407
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,960
That's why my father forcibly got me married at 16.

408
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,700
After first year of marriage, Rajesh was born.

409
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,930
After that Mahesh.

410
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,930
Like they say poverty has many kids...

411
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,420
After Mahesh, Abhilasha, Veeresh and later Kallesh and Mallesh.

412
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,240
Why are crying boy?

413
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,990
My boy? Are you hungry?

414
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,090
Lie down.

415
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,360
Like this, I had many kids.

416
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,560
At 22, I was a father of 6 kids.

417
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,830
Suddenly.

418
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,120
God was angry at me.

419
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,120
Bad times started you see.

420
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,630
As soon as the last one Mallesh was born,

421
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,770
his mother died right after.

422
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,560
While we were already suffering with all these difficulties...

423
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,160
there was another tragedy waiting.

424
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,590
That studio which used to feed my family...

425
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,710
was burnt down due to a short circuit.

426
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,310
My father died in that fire right in front of my eyes.

427
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,680
I wandered everywhere searching for a job to feed my children.

428
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,400
I didn't get a job anywhere.

429
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,270
Then in your brother's newspaper...

430
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,040
I saw this ad for reporter preferably with a camera and came to your shop.

431
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I heard someone talking there.

432
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,640
Instead of starving 6 children,

433
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
I thought lying would be better.

434
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,620
I mustered enough courage and told a lie to you.

435
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,920
As soon as I lied to you...

436
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,250
God seem to have gotten angry at me.

437
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,180
He got me caught and you took away the camera.

438
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,820
I have no other way to make a living.

439
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,680
That's why,

440
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,520
I have decided to poison myself and my children and die.

441
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,900
But only I've asked for your forgiveness.

442
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,040
Don't do it.

443
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,840
Don't poison the children.

444
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,840
I don't know in which previous lives we had poisoned the children,

445
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,680
we have no children in this life.

446
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,300
Now, if we are the cause for your children's death...

447
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,810
that sin will stick to us for 7 more lives.

448
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,150
You want the camera right?

449
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,680
I'll get you the camera.

450
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,220
You take care of your life.

451
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,280
But don't poison the children.

452
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,780
Children.

453
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,120
I'll bring you some sweets.

454
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Please bring them quickly.

455
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,920
Hey get up. They said they'll give us sweets.

456
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,700
Go and have them. Don't be shy.

457
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,270
How cute they are.

458
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,440
Take this.

459
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,760
Take this camera.
Thank you sir.

460
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,100
Take this money too.

461
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:39,270
I can't see these children in torn clothes. Buy them new clothes and feed them.

462
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,130
Sir.

463
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,260
I won't forget your help in this life.

464
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,030
Please sir, if you don't mind. Please madam stand with him.

465
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,610
I'll take only one photo.

466
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,160
I'll frame it and worship you in my home.

467
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,440
Now smile.

468
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,160
Smile.

469
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,340
And then?

470
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,860
He thinks he's very smart. He doesn't know I'm smarter than him.

471
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,760
He was happy that he caught me.

472
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,140
I had taken all the neighbours' children.

473
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,640
I started weaving some tale and...

474
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,980
that idiot believed everything and started crying.

475
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,040
His wife...

476
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,000
idiot too.

477
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,160
Here I was running a train without tracks and she was crying hearing all that.

478
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,570
At last.

479
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,290
Those two fools gave the camera,

480
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,610
gave money for children's clothes...

481
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,400
and fed the very mouth that lied with sweets.

482
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,100
Are there fools like this still in this world?

483
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,400
There are.

484
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,150
It's you sir.

485
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,280
Who are these Lambodhara? The same fools?

486
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,570
Yes, it's us.

487
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,790
We are fools to still believe in dharma and karma.

488
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,210
When did you come?

489
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,900
We came while you were praising us.

490
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,330
I had forgotten to give the flash with the camera.

491
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,720
I got your address from 'Vishala Karnataka' newspaper and came here just to give it to you.

492
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,600
What kind of people are you?

493
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,460
When a man is boasting how he cheated someone...

494
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,120
you people are laughing with him.

495
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Are you all humans?

496
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
What are you looking at? Give me the camera.

497
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,650
The money I gave?

498
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,650
I spent it for the clothes.

499
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,710
A lie even after all this.

500
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,940
We should hand him over to police.
No need for that.

501
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,010
We've already been shamed in front of these people.

502
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,010
Should those police too laugh at us?

503
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,320
I'll have you fired from your job.

504
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,640
What Lambodhara?

505
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,090
Do you have my rent?

506
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,100
Oh Mr. Janardhanayya, you should've come a bit early.

507
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
You should've come 5 minutes before.

508
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,750
I had pocket full of money.

509
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,870
A poor Brahmin and his wife just left.

510
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,360
They asked for help with their daughter's marriage. So, I gave everything I had.

511
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,260
Look here. You're cheating me like this every month.

512
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,940
Will you give me the rent or not?

513
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,560
No, sir.

514
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,130
Ok then.

515
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,950
My people will come and throw you out.

516
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,230
Be ready.
So be it.

517
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,660
What is this Lambodhara?

518
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,080
Today all planets are against you?

519
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,480
Yes. I seem to be having a bad time.

520
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,310
I should go somewhere and take rest for 15 days.

521
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,510
Can I give you an idea?

522
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,240
Sure.

523
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,480
Best thing would be to steal and go to jail.

524
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,360
Free boarding. Free lodging.

525
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,120
You'll get good rest.

526
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,860
You'll get time to think about your next scheme.

527
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,870
Who will respect me if I go to jail?

528
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,010
I have a better idea myself.

529
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,840
What is it?

530
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,370
I'll go to hospital complaining about throat or stomach pain and get admitted there.

531
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,560
Income is zero.

532
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,440
If I mention that I'm an unemployed in the form...

533
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,780
I'll get free lunch, bread, milk and banana.

534
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,400
If one is a non-vegetarian, egg is also free.

535
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,250
In addition you get to see beautiful nurses walking around you.

536
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,040
What brain you have.

537
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,760
If anyone wants to know how many ways there are to survive,

538
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,120
they must come to you.

539
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,010
That's alright but when did you get this hospital idea?

540
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,560
This is an old idea.

541
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,860
Very old.

542
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,100
I used to take rest in hospitals before.

543
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
If discharged from Victoria, go to Bowring.

544
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,480
If discharged from Bowring, go to Victoria.

545
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,930
Bowring - Victoria, Victoria - Bowring.

546
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,090
You're a very thrilling personality.
Am I not?

547
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,530
But why did you leave that?

548
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,600
A nurse fell him love with me there and started pestering me.

549
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,060
I dumped this idea because of her.
What if she bothers you now too?

550
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,940
How can she now?

551
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,940
She would've been transferred to somewhere else, right?

552
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Then your next programme is...?

553
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,620
Why is the milk watery today?

554
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,380
The cow drank more water today. That's why.

555
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,940
Ayyo! Amma!

556
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,230
Hi, Lambu dear!

557
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,710
Lambu dear.

558
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,900
By god's grace you're ill again.

559
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,240
I was so worried that you may not get ill and come back here at all, you know?

560
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,210
Didn't you get transferred somewhere else?

561
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,120
Why Lambu dear? You are sad after seeing me.

562
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,430
You know how much I love you?

563
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,930
Whenever you came to the hospital...

564
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,000
I have taken special care of you. You know?

565
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,130
That's why I have got sick again for you.

566
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,300
Is it?
Yes.
Thank you Lambu dear.

567
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,130
Take this milk.

568
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,840
For him, I'll serve the milk.

569
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,700
Take this bread.
Give me that.

570
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,930
Lambu dear.

571
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,960
Shall I feed you bread and milk?
No. I'll eat them myself.

572
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,700
When will the doctor come?

573
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,280
He'll come in half an hour.

574
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,110
Sister, doctor is calling you.

575
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,710
I'll come. You go.

576
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,370
Lambu dear.

577
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,970
You should drink milk after it cools down and then take rest.

578
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,240
I'll leave.
OK.

579
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,540
How are you?
I'm OK sir.

580
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,330
What's happening?

581
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,740
My stomach's aching.

582
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,330
Looks like Appendicitis.

583
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,180
Get him to the operation theatre immediately.

584
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,730
Are you a new doctor?

585
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,840
Why? Are you scared?

586
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,430
No. Not scared.

587
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:10,130
I thought there will be Dr. Mantralaya or Dr. Dharmashala here.

588
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,470
There's no doctor by that name here.

589
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,090
It's not their names. But nick names I have for them.

590
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,480
Dr. Mantralaya means Dr. Raghavendra.

591
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,470
Dr. Dharmasthala means Dr. Manjunath.

592
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,000
What's your name doctor?
Dr. Thirupathi.

593
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,380
You mean Dr. Venkatesh?
No.

594
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,910
Shrinivas.
Oh, Dr, Shrinivas.

595
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,990
How long do I have to stay after the operation?

596
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,990
Some 15-20 days.

597
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,600
15-20 days... OK go ahead.

598
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,560
Why do you ask?

599
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,030
No, I might get bored after 15 days.

600
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,600
Oh, I see.

601
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Why hasn't the surgeon come yet?

602
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,730
Sorry everybody.

603
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,140
You? Get up.

604
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,290
What happened?
Doctor, he isn't sick. It's all a ruse.

605
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,220
Ruse?

606
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,770
I know him very well.

607
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,070
Makes something up and gets admitted into a government hospital.

608
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,980
He stays as long as possible in one hospital. Once discharged, goes to another.

609
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,920
This is his job.

610
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,780
Why do you do all this?

611
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,880
For food.

612
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,560
Fruits, milk, bread are all provided free in hospitals, right?

613
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,700
That's why this trick.

614
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,280
Long ago, he got admitted into the hospital I was working.

615
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,370
Only when I took him to operation theatre...

616
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,100
...I learnt about his tricks.

617
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,900
This is the third time he's getting caught by me.

618
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
My bad luck.
Get up.

619
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,560
Get out.

620
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,820
Hey, go now.

621
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,920
Hey, take the hospital clothes back.

622
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,790
What a weird character.

623
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:54,390
If operation had been done, I could've stayed and thought about future.

624
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,960
Hi, Lambu dear.

625
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,170
What are you doing?

626
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,390
What's this?
Dead body.

627
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,620
Don't you have seriousness while moving the dead body?

628
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,140
If I take every dead one seriously, I have to stop doing my job and cry all day.

629
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,250
What's this Lambu dear?

630
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,270
You're looking at that dead woman while I'm standing here.

631
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,690
I was looking at her with pity. So young. What happened?

632
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,460
Heart surgery. It was a failure.

633
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,960
Shouldn't have happened at this young age.

634
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,440
What's her name?
Gowri.

635
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,760
Isn't there anyone for her?

636
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,230
No one. She's an orphan.

637
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,980
Her friends had admitted her. Would come in the evening.

638
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,840
Which ward was she in?

639
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,280
Female ward.

640
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,280
What's the bed number?

641
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,640
You want that too? 14.

642
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,060
14. Ok then I'll leave sister.

643
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Lambu dear. I've told you many times not to call me sister.
Oh sorry, I forgot.

644
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,840
I'll leave my sexy Sarsu.

645
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,810
Gowri.

646
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,170
Gowri! My sister.

647
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,110
You left your brother alone here?

648
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,830
Gowri my sister.

649
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,370
As a brother, I couldn't be with you in your last moments.

650
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,020
How's she related to you?

651
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,110
I'm crying sister. You couldn't understand?

652
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:37,440
He's already overcome with grief. Why do you bother him?

653
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,710
Does this all belong to Gowri?

654
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,790
She had the habit of writing her diary daily.

655
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,200
I had bought this saree for her last Deepavali.

656
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,050
During new year celebrations,

657
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,810
she was looking so beautiful in this you know?

658
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,800
Gowri, without you...

659
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,420
I won't live in this world.

660
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,200
I'll also come.

661
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
I'll leave.

662
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,020
Please have this.

663
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,290
This is how brotherly love must be.

664
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,970
Mother Gowri.

665
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,310
I'm taking this bag for my own sake.

666
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,130
This is not theft.

667
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,710
Because we both are orphans.

668
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,280
If I leave this, someone else will take this.

669
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,080
So, believing that this is your help to me, I'm taking this with me.

670
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,240
If it is wrong, please forgive me.

671
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,080
How much will you give sir?

672
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,520
I'll give 75 for each.
I'm in need. Please reconsider.

673
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,010
No, no. It won't get a cent more than 75 rupees.

674
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,010
Ok give me.
GIve the sarees.

675
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,730
What shall I give you sir?
Give me a strong coffee.

676
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,200
I write the diary as a hobby.

677
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,850
I read it for self assessment.

678
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,590
Gowri.

679
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,060
Must have been a poetess.

680
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:35,200
I carried an ambition to leave a permanent mark on this world.

681
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,640
But what do I do?

682
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,840
I was born into a poor family.

683
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,300
Because a numerous weird incidents happened in my life...

684
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,710
and because I wanted my name to be remembered,

685
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,370
I've told all these incidents to an author.

686
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,790
Even if I die in this heart surgery,

687
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,940
at least,

688
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,200
my name, my life,

689
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,400
should be documented in a novel. That's the aim of this diary.

690
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,020
This is very interesting.

691
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,260
I might an idea too.

692
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,670
Three prominent persons who came in my life.

693
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,280
Anand Rao.

694
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,750
Washington, USA.

695
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,840
Madhusudan, 9th cross, C R Das road, Calcutta.

696
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,000
Chandramouli, S/O Puranchandra Rao, G N Road, Amritsar, Punjab.

697
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,270
All the three are not in Karnataka.

698
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,440
My close friend, Chanchala.

699
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,200
She was married?

700
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,560
Her story is quite mysterious.

701
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,330
Who's the novelist?

[Novel author- Raja Chendoor]

703
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:12,400
I'm happy to know that you're interested in her life, Lambodhar.

704
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,040
But a director took that story to make a film.

705
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,680
Who's that director?

706
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,450
When you've come with so much enthusiasm,

707
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,450
it won't be nice of me to say no.

708
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,210
This is the script I've made out of Gowri's true story.

709
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,460
Take this.

710
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,940
But bring it back after you've read.
Sure.

711
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,280
Thank you.

712
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,620
In a town,

713
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,620
there was a beautiful girl,

714
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,360
and her name was Gowri.

715
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,700
Without her mother and in the clutches of her stepmother,

716
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,110
she was growing up.

717
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:25,760
Her beauty became a curse for this girl.

718
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,990
The girl suffered like a flower in the summer heat.

719
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,020
Death came for her father.

720
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,750
Stepmother started showing her demonic face.

721
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,120
Her beauty caught stepmother's evil eye.

722
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,130
Stepmother conspired to force her into prostitution.

723
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,130
Her beauty caught stepmother's evil eye.

724
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,260
Stepmother conspired to force her into prostitution.

725
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,130
She was a righteous woman.

726
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,210
Suffered from all the injustice.

727
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,340
She left her home.

728
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:18,520
And became a bird without its nest.

729
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,820
A friend showing compassion,

730
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,930
gave shelter to Gowri.

731
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,640
Because of the compassion shown by her friend,

732
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:07,010
she got a job in an office.

733
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,610
What can I say?

734
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:18,690
The place she worked at, the boss was a womaniser.

735
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,740
Anand Rao with his lustful eyes,

736
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,740
Became a hawk for this bird.

737
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,160
Gowri, Come in.

738
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,730
Gowri, you didn't give an answer to my question.

739
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,430
To which question?

740
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,450
That...you will spend a night with me.

741
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,680
I'm sorry sir.

742
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,400
I'm not like that.

743
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,900
Look, I don't care what kind of woman you are.

744
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:52,020
There's no space for any woman who wouldn't fulfill my wish. That's all.

745
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,500
Sir, please don't do so.

746
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,910
I'm very poor sir.

747
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,680
You may be poor in money.

748
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,340
But in beauty...

749
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,840
you're rich.

750
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,840
Look Gowri. If you think a bit broadly...

751
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,590
you can be the owner of all that belongs to this Anand Rao.

752
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,750
You can enjoy the riches.

753
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,600
You mean?

754
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:15,750
I have no interest in my wife to whom my parents forcibly got me married.

755
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,950
You have 4 children without being interested?

756
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,200
Oh, forget that. It keeps happening if there's interest or not.

757
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,210
But one will have his own desires and taste, right?

758
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,260
Look Gowri, I've slept with all the woman in my office.

759
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,970
But I don't just desire you, I love you too.

760
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,750
If you agree,

761
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,970
I'm ready to accept you as my wife.

762
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,270
You, a father of 4 children will marry me?

763
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,000
Why not? If you want, I'll divorce my wife.

764
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Just because you desire me,

765
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:50,310
I can't let you abandon your wife and children.

766
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,410
Then, spend a night with me.

767
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,610
I'm mad after you.

768
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,130
Sir, I'm not like what you think.

769
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,430
So, you don't want to fulfill my desire.

770
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,960
Then I wouldn't like you working in my office.

771
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:11,010
Look Gowri. Day after tomorrow, My family and I are going to America.

772
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,940
Probably I may settle in Washington.

773
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:17,030
That means we have only one day for us.

774
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:21,400
Tomorrow evening, if you fulfill my desire, your job is permanent.

775
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,040
Otherwise, I'll dismiss you before I leave for America.

776
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,240
Even if you agree and want to surrender to me later, I won't be there.

777
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,640
Think about it.

778
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,190
Poor girl. Why do you cry for such a small thing?

779
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,790
These things are common today.

780
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,790
Skin to skin, there's no sin, you know?

781
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,160
What'll you lose if you spend a night with him?

782
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,830
I'll lose the most important.

783
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:47,990
My honour.
You fool.

784
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:51,490
These are old theories. But know this, the new age theory.

785
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,830
We must enjoy everything there is before the marriage.

786
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,680
You can be loyal to someone after that.

787
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,170
We would be cheating the guys who trusts us while marrying.

788
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,310
They can expect the purity in us only if they are, right?

789
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,310
We won't have freedom after marriage.

790
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,160
So, before that happens,

791
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,060
we must enjoy how a man would enjoy in his life.

792
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,280
Look, I can't do all that.

793
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,620
Then lose the job. Why should I bother?

794
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,400
Hey, when she's asking your advice as a friend, this is the advice you give?

795
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,840
Your father is western and your mother, ultra modern.

796
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,530
That's why women drinking, smoking and sleeping with other men is not such a big deal for you.

797
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:32,240
But she's a traditional woman. You can't change her mindset.

798
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,240
Give her some other advice.

799
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,740
Hey Gowri, come here.

800
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,480
OK sir.

801
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,170
I agree to do what you asked.

802
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,940
Really? I feel happy as if I've conquered this whole world.

803
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,250
But one condition sir.

804
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,080
What is it?

805
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,080
You must come to the place I tell you.

806
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,750
Only for one hour.

807
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,200
OK Gowri, I'll agree to everything.

808
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,610
I just want to make you mine.

809
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,610
Where shall I come and when?

810
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,600
Come in.

811
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,780
Come inside.

812
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,020
Please sit down.

813
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,070
Come sit down.

814
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,240
I was scared that you might change your mind at the last minute.

815
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,890
Whenever I make a decision, there's no question of changing it.

816
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,110
This house owner will come back by 10pm.

817
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,730
Your job must get over before that.

818
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,340
No one must know about this.
Sure Gowri.

819
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,660
I don't just lust you but I've real love for you.

820
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,130
Pure love.

821
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,970
Whatever, ultimately it ends in this, right?

822
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,750
In fact...

823
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,170
I placed you in my heart when I first saw you.

824
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,530
10 minutes have already gone by.

825
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,360
If you keep on chatting like this, the calling bell would ring any minute.

826
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,630
And you'll have to leave.

827
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,710
You seem to be in hurry more than me.

828
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,910
I think I've not closed the back door.

829
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,910
I'll close that and come back?
OK.

830
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,960
Oh, the power is out.
Let it go.

831
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,030
Saved the trouble of switching the light off.

832
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:19,670
Super, super.

833
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:24,360
Oh Gowri darling, come, come.

834
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,940
Slave to the pleasures, the fool Anand Rao...

835
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:34,020
believed all that happened in the dark.

836
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,960
Slave to the pleasures, the fool Anand Rao...

837
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,130
believed all that happened in the dark.

838
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,970
His lustful arrow missed the target.

839
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,540
He didn't get this bird after all.

840
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,960
This secret whom no one knows...

841
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,050
was documented in this diary.

842
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:06,440
And became an inspiration for this story.

843
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,200
Thank you very much.

844
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,420
I won't forget your help all my life.
What's there in it?

845
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,420
Look here.

846
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,800
I got money and pleasure.

847
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,270
Not bad. He's left some money too.

848
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,840
Not just that. You know what else he said?

849
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,840
He loves you very much.

850
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,570
He said, if at all you get pregnant after today,

851
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,780
you must not abort the baby.

852
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,840
Because he has only girl children.

853
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,140
If he gets a boy from you, he said he'll keep you with him.

854
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,960
He has talked quite a lot then.

855
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,360
There's more.

856
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,470
After going to America, he'll write letters to you.

857
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:45,160
You must report your health back to him.

858
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,470
That's fine. But what were you doing all this while?

859
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,710
If I talk, he'll know me by voice.

860
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:56,020
So, I just kept saying hmm, aha and passed the time.

861
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,160
Gowri's bad time did not end here.

862
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,370
Fate had something else in store.

863
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,100
Tragedy came in the name of a disease.

864
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,610
Gowri's heart was failing.

865
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:23,190
There's a problem in the heart. We need to perform bypass surgery as soon as possible.

866
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,300
How much would it cost doctor?

867
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,300
We need at least 60000 rupees.

868
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,280
Can't we do anything without the surgery?

869
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,280
This is very delicate.

870
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,860
If we don't perform surgery in two months, there's danger to her life.

871
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,640
OK doctor, we'll try.

[Shri Shaila Charitable Organisation]

873
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,670
To save best friend Gowri's life...

874
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:57,780
her friends sought help from everywhere.

875
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:05,890
They sent letters to everywhere seeking money.

876
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,040
Excuse me. Where is Ms. Gowri staying here?
That room.

877
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,870
Excuse me. I wanted Ms. Gowri.

878
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:31,570
It's me.
Hello, my name is Chandramouli.

879
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:35,280
The letter you sent seeking help reached our organisation.

880
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,280
I came here to alk about that.

881
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,710
Would you please come?
Yes. Come Chanchala.
Excuse me. This is a bit personal.

882
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,710
There's no secrets between us.

883
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,490
Moreover, she wrote that letter to you.

884
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,490
Is it? Then it's OK. Please come.

885
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,480
I'll help you with the money for the surgery.

886
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,520
Many thanks sir.

887
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,600
We were disappointed getting no help. God has sent you to us.

888
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,280
But I want something in return.

889
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,340
I'm expecting a favour from you.
What is it sir?

890
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,400
My father is Purananda Rao and mother, Vishalakshamma.

891
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,860
Both of them are settled in Punjab.

892
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,860
I'm looking after the business here.

893
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,480
We are rich.

894
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,980
How can we help rich people like you?

895
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:18,580
See, I've no interest in marriage or children.

896
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:23,540
Even then, my parents are forcing me to marry my uncle's daughter.

897
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,360
So?

898
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,060
There's only one way to escape from this marriage and my father.

899
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,300
I'm going to tell him that I've loved and married a girl.
So?

900
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,520
What should we do?

901
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,150
You must act like you're that girl.

902
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,080
Don't be so terrified.

903
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,720
Wait. Let's first hear him out.

904
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,730
How do you mean?

905
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:51,300
We should get a photo taken as a couple.

906
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,150
I'll show that in my home.

907
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,700
You don't worry.

908
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,160
I'll give your photo and the negative back.

909
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,420
That's all?

910
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,420
If my father still doesn't agree to let me go...

911
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,200
I'll arrange a fake wedding reception at Hotel Ashok.

912
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,730
Everything will be like a real reception.

913
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:13,380
But except for my parents, everyone else will know that it's a fake reception.

914
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,450
You mean, I should act like your wife?

915
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,620
That's only until my parents see us and go back.

916
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,680
We can both part ways after that.

917
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,000
What if your parents likes her and wants to take her home?

918
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,130
That's not at all possible.

919
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:30,310
Because there's terrorist problem there, they won't take her with them.

920
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,970
Or if they come here?

921
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,590
Who will look after the properties there?

922
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:37,910
Once my uncle's daughter is married, I'll tell my father everything.

923
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:40,580
What if your father causes any harm to me?

924
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:44,040
See, I'll guarantee that nothing will happen to you by doing this.

925
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,640
You please think about it and let me know.

926
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,480
This is my phone number and address.

927
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,250
I'll leave.

928
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,860
Hey Gowri, you can agree to this blindfolded.

929
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,780
No, this is very risky.

930
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,500
What if something goes wrong?
You fool.

931
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,550
This profits you either way. Just agree to this.

932
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,490
How's that?

933
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,070
If this ends in just a drama...

934
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,780
you'll have money for your surgery.

935
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,870
If this gets serious and they accept you as daughter in law...

936
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,880
he's handsome anyway.

937
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,680
Why don't you...?
Stop. I'm interested only in touch and go jobs.

938
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,560
You get your photo taken with him. I'll take care of the rest.

939
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,680
Do you see this Vishala?

940
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,600
Look how he pays us back for all the love we gave him.

941
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,060
I told you before that...

942
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,020
He should stay with us. Did you listen to me?

943
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,320
You said, 'there's terrorist problem, let him stay in home town.'

944
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:48,530
What did he do there? He married some unknown girl and came here.

945
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,530
Were we all dead to you?

946
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,770
Didn't you try to get me married to your sister's daughter?

947
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,330
That's why I married first and then informed you.

948
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:58,400
Why? You should've informed us after the kid was born.
That may happen soon too.

949
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,710
Aren't you ashamed to say that?

950
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:01,780
Why should I be ashamed?

951
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,340
I have arranged for the reception on 21st in Bangalore.

952
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,920
I've come to invite you and seek your blessings.

953
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,480
If you come to Bangalore that day,

954
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,510
call me. I'll tell you where to come. That's all, Goodbye.

955
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:26,290
Without tying the knot or any rituals,

956
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:30,240
Gowri became a bride in front of all people.

957
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:38,740
She became a character in this drama of fake wedding.

958
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:46,370
Wish you very very happy married life Mr.Chandramouli.

959
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,920
Hey, stop it. Is this a real wedding?

960
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,520
Gowri, meet my friend Madhu. A big industrialist.

961
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,320
He's settled in Calcutta.

962
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,320
Hello.
Namaskara.

963
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:04,000
Hey, when you have found such a beauty, why this fake wedding? Marry her for real.

964
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
If I had a chance.
Hey, she's a heart patient.
Let her be.

965
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,480
Can you find another wife like that?

966
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,640
Hey Madhu, your drink is ready. Come.

967
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,350
My drink is waiting.

968
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,400
Don't drink too much and lose control. Take care.

969
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:25,970
I only know what I drink. I won't what happens next. You carry on.

970
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,690
Hi Gowri. Hello sir.
Hello.

971
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,960
Wish your married life be sweet like milk and honey.

972
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,000
That's not possible. Sir?

973
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,760
How long do we wait? Your parents haven't come?

974
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,590
I too don't understand why.

975
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:43,780
My father is a very doubtful person.

976
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,030
He should've come to at least check if this is real.

977
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,360
One minute. I'll be back.
OK.

978
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,090
Hey Gowri. If you don't mind, I'll have some wine.

979
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,520
Do whatever you want. I won't stop you.

980
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,720
Thank you. Let's go.

981
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,330
Hey Madhu, my parents haven't come yet.

982
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:04,820
Whenever they come here, they stay at Sheshagiri Rao's house. Would you please check?

983
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,590
That's all? You go stand there.
OK Thank you.

984
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,080
Who ordered wine?
I did.

985
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,640
Sorry friend.

986
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,340
Your parents haven't come to Bangalore at all.

987
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,060
All this is wasted.

988
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,000
OK. I'll call Amritsar myself and come back.

989
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,250
Hello?
Hello.

990
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,330
It's me Chandramouli. Is that daddy speaking?

991
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,630
No. It's servant Bahadur Singh.

992
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,700
Some terrorists barged into the house today and shot at master.

993
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,610
Master is very hurt.

994
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,160
He's in hospital.

995
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,710
Mother is also with him.
I'll leave immediately.

996
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,850
Why sir? Why did you say so?

997
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:05,030
I wantonly told him that. He arranges a reception without respecting our wishes and we must simply go there?

998
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,230
Let that reception be damned.

999
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,230
Gowri.
Why are you so anxious?

1000
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,960
Terrorists have shot at my father.

1001
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,600
I'm leaving immediately.

1002
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:18,720
You and your friends can stay at the wedding suite this night.

1003
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,910
Or do whatever you feel like. I'll leave.

1004
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,810
Thought of something and something else happened.

1005
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:33,960
The fake wedding reception stopped unexpectedly.

1006
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,920
Chandramouli left to see his father...

1007
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,200
and took a flight with sadness.

1008
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:54,800
Fate had planned something else. Death took him away.

1009
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,280
Come let's all go to hostel. It's all over anyway.

1010
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,620
No. He said the wedding suite is booked in your name.

1011
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:06,280
We'll sleep there and go tomorrow.

1012
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:13,000
How often do we middle class people get to sleep in a 5000 rupees suite?

1013
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,400
I don't want that. I won't sleep in a honeymoon suite before marriage.

1014
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,540
You can sleep there if you want. What do you all say?

1015
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,160
We all will go to the hostel.

1016
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,480
You're all village idiots.

1017
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,410
You don't know how to enjoy life.

1018
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,410
I'll sleep there.

1019
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:28,360
Good night.

1020
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:55,640
Something weird happened here too. Fate brought in a third character here.

1021
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,280
The friend drank over his limit.

1022
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,560
He was searching for his room.

1023
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:15,880
Intoxicated, he entered the wedding suite and saw a woman lying there.

1024
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:49,780
Madhu was slave to the alcohol. This fool didn't understand what happened there.

1025
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,830
[Good night to Chandramouli and Gowri- Hotel Ashok]

1026
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,150
Gowri, I... in my intoxicated state...

1027
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,330
Gowri became a fruit untouched by any bird.

1028
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:05,570
But everybody thought they had the same fruit.

1029
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:16,370
Like a lotus untouched by the mud around it, Gowri remained a virgin throughout her life.

1030
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:22,290
And died as a virgin.

1031
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,560
Hey, Phaniramachandra.

1032
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,480
You wrote the story until now.

1033
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,120
I'll tell the rest of the story in my own way.

1034
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,120
What's this Lambodhara? You're doing pooja to some girl's photo?

1035
01:03:55,910 --> 01:04:00,050
This girl might become a goddess who gives everything to me. That's why.

1036
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,040
How's that?

1037
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,540
Look, I'm telling all of this because you're close. You musn't tell anyone.

1038
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,840
Look Lambodhara, I'm only interested to know about your thrilling life.

1039
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,500
Have I caused any trouble to you before?
Then listen.

1040
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:14,230
She's Gowri.

1041
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,700
An orphan like me.

1042
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,350
Day before yesterday, she died after heart surgery.

1043
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,350
I got this diary she had.

1044
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:24,240
I came to know after reading that diary.

1045
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,240
That three men had come in her life.

1046
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,530
You mean she's a...

1047
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:35,400
None of those three have even touched her.

1048
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:42,880
One in dark and another in intoxicated state have believed that they've slept with her.

1049
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,440
The third one had a fake wedding with her and died.

1050
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,440
But his parents still believe that she's their daughter in law.

1051
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,830
Then where are they now?

1052
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:56,290
One in Washington, another in Calcutta. The third one's parents live in Punjab.

1053
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:59,920
Because they're all so far away, I've planned something.

1054
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,920
What's that plan?

1055
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,990
There's boy born from Gowri now.

1056
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:10,420
But you said no one touched her?

1057
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:13,080
No, he's born in my imagination.

1058
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,840
And then that I'm raising that kid.

1059
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,500
So, I'll write a letter to all the three.

1060
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,330
What?

1061
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:23,510
Dear So & so, Because You/ Your son...

1062
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:27,060
...had an affair with my sister Gowri...

1063
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:31,320
she became pregnant and has given birth to a boy.

1064
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,920
But because there were complications during delivery, she died after birth.

1065
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,030
Before she died, she called me and said,

1066
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:48,000
'Brother, This is the boy's father. I'll give you their address. Please send a letter and inform them.'

1067
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:53,890
'If they like let them come and take the child or else send him to an orphanage.'

1068
01:05:54,130 --> 01:06:01,680
'If they like the child but can't take the child fearing the society,'

1069
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:05,460
'and if they agree to send you some money, brother,'

1070
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:10,050
'please raise him like your own son.' Saying this she died.

1071
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,860
As a brother, I've been following my duties.

1072
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,880
So, I've decided to await your instructions from now on,

1073
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,500
and I'm waiting for your answer regarding the same. Gowri's brother, me.

1074
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,930
What if they want to come and take the child?

1075
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:27,240
I've written to then asking to inform me beforehand.

1076
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,650
If they come, I'll run away.

1077
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,120
What if they ask you to send that child to an orphanage?

1078
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,440
I'll shut up thinking my plan failed.

1079
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,080
But by luck, if they ask me to raise the child,

1080
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,300
and send the money every month...

1081
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,840
in the name of that unborn child...

1082
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,800
and counting all the money they send every month...

1083
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,660
I can live like a king, isn't it?

1084
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,840
What brain you have.

1085
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,800
If my luck strikes Ratnakar...

1086
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,480
I'll have 3000 rupees every month.

1087
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,640
It's time for the postal clearance. I'll leave.

1088
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,030
Leave oh, great being.

1089
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,200
Mother Gowri, may my plan become a success.

1090
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,520
This damned  Lambodhara won't hear the bell.

1091
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,520
Lambodhara, Lambodhara.

1092
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,790
Will you pay the rent or should I throw you out?

1093
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,790
Why are yelling like a third class fellow?

1094
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:28,600
I'm a high class man now.

1095
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,410
I'm doing business in America, Calcutta and Amritsar.

1096
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,830
You were screaming for rent? Here it is.

1097
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,390
Not bad.

1098
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,320
Next month I'm vacating the house. Be ready with the advance amount.

1099
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,320
I can't stay in a pig sty like this.

1100
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,790
My letters would've reached by now.

1101
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:47,760
Gowri.

1102
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,710
You had a child from me?

1103
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,710
What a mistake I did.

1104
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:54,710
I should be punished for this.

1105
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,520
I'll take the responsibility of that child.

1106
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,740
But, I can't raise that child.

1107
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,740
I'm not married.

1108
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,470
I will.

1109
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:09,360
I will search and marry a woman who could raise him like her own.

1110
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,660
Till then, let Lambodhara take care of the child.

1111
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,660
I'll send the money he needs.

1112
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,040
Our grandson.

1113
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,270
Thank god, after Chandramouli died,

1114
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:21,080
I thought we were left with no heir.

1115
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,260
I'm happy that our bloodline is still alive.

1116
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,350
Let's go bring him here.
Oh, how can we bring him here?

1117
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,440
There's a lot of terrorist problem here.

1118
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,240
A few days ago a school bus was bombed and all the children in that died.

1119
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,680
We can't bring him now.
Then can we go there to see him?

1120
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:43,970
Oh, we too can't go out. I'll write a letter and ask Lambodhar to send a photo of the child.

1121
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:48,120
At last I have a boy child.

1122
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:49,960
Gowri.

1123
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,380
Don't worry.

1124
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,240
Just because you died, I won't let the child be sent to an orphanage.

1125
01:08:56,710 --> 01:08:58,100
But what do I do?

1126
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,250
If I were in India, I would've visited him immediately.

1127
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,740
I'm stuck in this foreign country.

1128
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,280
Gowri.

1129
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,280
I'll write a letter to your brother now.

1130
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,370
I'll ask him to raise my child.

1131
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:15,640
I'll send him not 500, but a 1000 rupees every month.

1132
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,940
Do you see Ratnakar? My plan is successful.

1133
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:23,240
All the three goats have fallen into my trap.

1134
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:27,750
What have they written?
All the 3 will send me money every month. So,

1135
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:32,340
to reinforce their trust in me, I'll write another letter telling them I've name the child 'Ganesha'.

1136
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,210
Why Ganesha?
Look.

1137
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,730
That Goddess Gowri didn't carry Ganesha in womb.

1138
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,360
But still lord Ganesha is Gowri's son, right?

1139
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,800
Likewise our Gowri was born a virgin and died a virgin.

1140
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,030
But didn't I create a son for her?

1141
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:47,240
So, her son's name will be Ganesha.

1142
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,960
Lambodhara.
What is it Puttammajji?

1143
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,840
There's a naming ceremony in our house for my grandson. You two must come have lunch with us.

1144
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,240
Sure.

1145
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:55,880
Are you video recording the ceremony?

1146
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,350
Now that is the fashion.

1147
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,000
Yes it is.

1148
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:02,980
Very good. Then I'll stand right next to the baby all day if you don't mind.

1149
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,220
Very good. I'll leave.
OK.

1150
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,900
I smell a scheme in this?
In what?

1151
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,220
That you asked if they're recording.

1152
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,560
I'll make three copies of the same video.

1153
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,910
I'll write saying that I've conducted naming ceremony.

1154
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:20,290
I'll send the 3 cassettes to all the 3.

1155
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:22,120
Then the fools will think...

1156
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,620
How's your child?

1157
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,620
He's very cute.

1158
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:35,620
M. Ganesha.

1159
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,220
You've named him M. Ganesha?

1160
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,080
M means... Madhusudan.

1161
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,970
Madhu's son, Ganesha. Beautiful. Beautiful.

1162
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,210
My sweet child.

1163
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,650
Your son, A. Ganesha.

1164
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,600
Ah? A. Ganesh. Meaning...

1165
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,080
Anand Rao Ganesh.

1166
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,960
How's your grandson?

1167
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,160
The child looks like little Krishna. Doesn't he?

1168
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,200
Yes, but the name Ganesha is not good.

1169
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,780
This time while sending the amount, ask him to change the name to Chandramouli.

1170
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,780
I'll write it now.

1171
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:32,980
Why not? Why I'll name him even Suryamouli if you like. What will I lose?

1172
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:36,120
How does it matter what we call an unborn child?

1173
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,400
I must keep getting my money. That's all I need.

1174
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:03,480
Your child is smiling...

1175
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:07,220
and playing in the cradle.

1176
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:10,820
Your child is smiling...

1177
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,900
and playing in the cradle.

1178
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:18,420
With the name Ganesha,

1179
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:22,360
this son of Gowri came to earth.

1180
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:26,040
Your child is smiling...

1181
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:30,020
and playing in the cradle.

1182
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,800
Like Gopi's son Krishna,

1183
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,600
his face is beautiful.

1184
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:56,080
With the blessings of family deities,

1185
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:00,040
this bond has developed.

1186
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:04,390
I got him triple antigen shots in his third month.

1187
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,740
Poor child. How hurt he must have been.

1188
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:11,320
I also got him Polio drops.

1189
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,160
The baby must have cried all night long.

1190
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,850
I bathe him myself.

1191
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:22,660
I'll sing the lullaby and send him to sleep.

1192
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:30,070
I've dedicated my life to raise your child.

1193
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,070
You're not man.
A god.

1194
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:37,700
Your child is smiling...

1195
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:41,490
he's taking baby steps.

1196
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:48,930
With the name Ganesha, this son of Gowri came to earth.

1197
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,550
[Gowri Garments]

1198
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:15,360
Attracted to the lamp, he touched the fire,

1199
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,920
and burnt his fingers today.

1200
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:22,640
He plays in water everyday.

1201
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:26,600
He rolls on the ground plays with mud.

1202
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:30,560
I carry him on my back and play with him.

1203
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,120
Oh, I don't have that pleasure.

1204
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:38,470
I show him your photo whenever he asks for you.

1205
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,680
Correct. I'm his father, right?

1206
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:45,430
I offered my service at Thirupathi.

1207
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:49,000
Got his first haircut there.

1208
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:56,310
I called all the ladies from the neighbourhood and did the ceremony.

1209
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:58,950
He has completed everything properly.

1210
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:03,880
Your child is smiling...

1211
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:07,970
and taking baby steps.

1212
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,410
With the name Ganesha,

1213
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,460
this son of Gowri came to earth.

1214
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:18,560
Your child is smiling...

1215
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,320
and taking baby steps.

1216
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:45,010
Holding a slate and breaking the chalk, he writes and mumbles.

1217
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:49,320
He writes the moon.

1218
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:53,060
He draws it and makes corrections too.

1219
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:56,610
He cries when I teach ABCD.

1220
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:00,200
But don't hit him because of that.

1221
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:04,150
He smiles when he hears A, Aa, I, Ee [Kannada Alphabet]

1222
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:07,940
Very good. He's like me, Kannada medium student.

1223
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,720
This naughty is Kannada lover.

1224
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,560
Knows Kannada multiplication tables by heart.

1225
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:19,380
Given a Kannada flag in his hand,

1226
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:23,200
he'll sing like a servant of Kannada.

1227
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,200
He'll definitely become a Kannada activist.

1228
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:30,280
Your child is smiling...

1229
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:34,360
He kisses if lifted in arms.

1230
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:37,970
With the name Ganesha,

1231
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:41,920
this son of Gowri came to earth.

1232
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,460
This is latest design saree madam.

1233
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,460
It has come to market only today.

1234
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,640
What's the price?

1235
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,640
Sir, what's the price of this?

1236
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,580

1237
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:13,680
125.

1238
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,490
How much?
125 madam.

1239
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:17,350
He seems to be deaf.

1240
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:19,880
He says 125 when his master is saying 175.

1241
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,150
We'll save 50 rupees. Let's give the money to him and leave.

1242
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:26,630
Pack this saree.

1243
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:31,110
Give him exactly 125.

1244
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:33,110
We'll give it to this boy and leave.
OK.

1245
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,760
Take this madam.
Take this boy.

1246
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:41,140
[Counting] Guru.

1247
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:44,320
They fell for our trap.

1248
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,320
See how they're running away.

1249
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,550
They gave 125 for a saree worth 75? Good. Take this.

1250
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,260
Keep working like this.

1251
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,980
Hello?
It's me.

1252
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,580
It's me Sarsu speaking here.

1253
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,830
What is it Sarsu?

1254
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:01,960
You've got a letter.
From whom?

1255
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,650
It's from Anand Rao.

1256
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,440
Did you read it?
Yes.

1257
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,350
Anand Rao is coming tomorrow to see his son Ganesha.

1258
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,670
He has asked you to bring the boy to the airport.

1259
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,520
Hello, hello.

1260
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,520
Why aren't you speaking?

1261
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:22,000
That... I'll come home.

1262
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:27,520
Sarsu... Sarsu...

1263
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,950
Give me that letter.

1264
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:36,600
Who's this Anand Rao and who's this Ganesha?

1265
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,430
Why should you take Ganesha to airport?

1266
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:41,430
You won't understand that.

1267
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:45,080
He says you've been raising his son?

1268
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,840
Whom are you raising?

1269
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,200
Ganesha.

1270
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,520
Who's he?

1271
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,170
Anand Rao's son.

1272
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:53,170
Who's Anand Rao?

1273
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,920
Ganesha's father.

1274
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,670
But why are you raising when he has his father?

1275
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,320
For Gowri.

1276
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,320
Who's Gowri?

1277
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,610
Ganesha's mother.

1278
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:05,990
Who's Ganesha?

1279
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,600
Gowri's son.

1280
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,600
But who's Gowri?

1281
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,600
I told you. Ganesha's mother.

1282
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:15,970
Oh, you mean Anand Rao and Gowri are husband and wife?

1283
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:17,010
No, no.

1284
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,210
Then?

1285
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:21,590
Anand Rao and Gowri are not husband and wife.

1286
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:25,540
But Ganesha is son to both. How's this possible?

1287
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:31,520
Oh, did they have an affair?

1288
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,520
Gowri is not like that.

1289
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,940
You're confusing me.

1290
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,580
Whatever it may be. Where is that Ganesha now?

1291
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,240
I'll tell you when I get hold of him.

1292
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,540
You don't even know where he is?

1293
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,510
I found him.
Where?

1294
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,940
[Divyajyoti Orphanage, Bangalore]

1295
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:58,440
Please come Mr.Lambodhar.

1296
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:03,200
The cheque hasn't been prepared yet for the clothes you supplied.
No, I didn't come for that.

1297
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:03,920
Then?

1298
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,260
I wanted a small boy.

1299
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,260
Oh, please come sit down.

1300
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,950
Is it because you haven't had a child for so many years?

1301
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,560
I haven't come for adoption.

1302
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,760
Then why do you need a boy?

1303
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,760
I'm stuck in a problem.

1304
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:22,470
One of my relatives had left their boy with me and went abroad.

1305
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,470
Now he's coming back after 5 years.

1306
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:27,590
During this time, their child fell ill and died.

1307
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:29,170
He's a heart patient.

1308
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:31,620
I didn't tell him fearing what may happen to him.

1309
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:34,800
He'll be here for a while. While he's here...

1310
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,480
I thought of showing one of the boys in your orphanage as his son.

1311
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,870
What if they want too take him with them?

1312
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:46,530
Don't worry. If such a thing happens, he will be adopted as per your orphanage rules.

1313
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,920
That boy will have a shelter and a heart patient will also be saved.

1314
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,270
Please take this.
No, no.

1315
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:55,270
That's alright. Keep it.

1316
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,040
Intention is good.

1317
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:03,970
But I wouldn't have to face any problems, right?
Not at all. If you want I'll sign a guarantee letter.

1318
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:05,620
Then it's OK.

1319
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:09,040
I'll show you all the smart kids. You take whomever you want.

1320
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:15,840
These are the smart kids in our orphanage. You can choose from them.

1321
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,990
Will you adopt us uncle?

1322
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:21,560
Look children. I'll ask some questions.

1323
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,200
Whoever gives the correct answer...

1324
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,870
I will take him with me.

1325
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,280
Ask us uncle.

1326
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:31,640
You'll put out an 8 yard saree to dry.

1327
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:35,000
It takes 5 minutes for a yard of saree to dry.

1328
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,450
Then how long will it take for the 8 yard saree to dry?

1329
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:39,890
40 minutes.

1330
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:41,240
Wrong.

1331
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,560
Only 5 minutes.

1332
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,750
Who's this boy?
His name is Ganesha.

1333
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,160
He's from here. Naughty and lies very much.

1334
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,620
Is it?

1335
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:57,720
I want someone like him. His name and character is most suited for me.

1336
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:58,790
Come boy.

1337
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:02,560
You see, you'll have to suffer. He's very dangerous.

1338
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,560
No problem. I want someone like him.

1339
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,920
Children,you can all go and play.

1340
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:11,040
Ganesha.

1341
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,400
Can I ask you a question?

1342
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,770
Why one? Ask me hundred.

1343
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:15,620
OK.

1344
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:19,590
Imagine that you want to get a haircut like Amitabh Bacchan.

1345
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:22,560
You'll go in search of a barber.

1346
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,560
There'll be two salons.

1347
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,080
One barber's hairstyle will be like Amitabh Bacchan.

1348
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,200
Another's hairstyle will be very bad.

1349
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,090
Like our master's?
I'll slap you you silly boy.

1350
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:36,210
Where will you get your haircut?

1351
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,990
The one with the bad hairstyle.

1352
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,850
Why?

1353
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:43,700
Would the one with the Amitabh's hairstyle cut his own hair?

1354
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:47,720
No. So, someone must have given him that nice haircut.

1355
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,560
It must be the one with the bad hairsyle, right?

1356
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,900
Good.
Patting me on the back is not enough.

1357
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:56,100
You must earn my praise.
Is it? OK.

1358
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,120
What should I do?

1359
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,890
Now, I'll ask a question. will you answer?

1360
01:22:59,890 --> 01:23:01,700
OK ask.

1361
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:04,820
When do elephants have eight legs?

1362
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:06,820
Elephants and eight legs?

1363
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,680
When do they have?

1364
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,580
When two elephants stand next to each other.

1365
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:15,010
You're very smart.

1366
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:16,610
Have you acted in plays?

1367
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:19,320
Who wants theatre? That's old.

1368
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,940
I want to shine in films.
Cinema?

1369
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:24,900
You mean you know some acting then?

1370
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,690
Who should I mimic?

1371
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,790
Dr. Rajkumar?

1372
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:44,880
[Singing a song from Rajkumar's film]

1373
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,340
Shall I mimic Vishnuvardhan?
Yes.

1374
01:23:48,880 --> 01:24:07,990
[Singing a song from Vishnuvardhan's film]

1375
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:10,920
Shall I do Ambareesh's?
Do it.

1376
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:28,320
[Singing a song from Ambaresh's film]

1377
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,580
Shall I do yours?
No, no. That's enough.

1378
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:35,810
The acting you need to do is completely different. I'll explain when we get home. I'll take him with me sir.

1379
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,010
Sarsu.

1380
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,240
I'm here.
Ah, you're here. See, I found Ganesha.

1381
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,240
Where did you find him?

1382
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:43,640
Where was he until now?

1383
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,600
More important than that, doesn't matter who asks...

1384
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,940
you have to tell them that he is with us since his birth.

1385
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,430
Please bring us some coffee.

1386
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,430
Come sit down.

1387
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,690
Sir, will you tell me what is my role tomorrow?

1388
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,880
I have to think about that role.

1389
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,080
Aha, you think you're a big actor? Wants to think about role...

1390
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,470
Look if you insult me like this, I'll go back to orphanage.
Hey, don't do that.

1391
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:08,960
No, no. I'll explain.

1392
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,360
Tomorrow morning at 10, someone called Anand Rao will come from America.

1393
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,760
You have to act like his son.

1394
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,120
I'll show you how.

1395
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,880
You need not show me the acting.

1396
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,790
You explain the scene. I'll manage the acting part.

1397
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:25,520
You son of a... No not you. Slip of the tongue.

1398
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,450
I'll take you to airport tomorrow.

1399
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:29,680
I'll show him to you.

1400
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:33,300
As soon as you see him, you should run and embrace him calling him daddy.

1401
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,140
Did you get it?
OK, OK.

1402
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:37,140
Shall I show you once?
Yes show me.

1403
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,440
Now, you're my daddy.

1404
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,120
Oh, he's your dad, I'm your uncle.

1405
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,340
I know. But you act like you're the daddy and I'll act like I'm the son.
Oh, OK.

1406
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,470
Stand there.

1407
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:55,030
You want slow motion or fast?

1408
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:57,830
Oh, you have that too?
Then what?

1409
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:01,120
Haven't you seen films? Slow motion means...

1410
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:08,980
[Calling 'Daddy' in slow motion]

1411
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:12,610
Now fast motion is like...

1412
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,230
Shall I come?
Yes.
Daddy.

1413
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,350
Which one shall I do? The first or the second?

1414
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,350
Do the second one, that's enough.

1415
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:29,670
Come quickly. How long will you take?

1416
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:34,450
Wait a second. My father is coming from a foreign country. Shouldn't I dress accordingly?

1417
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:37,240
You're acting too much.
Remove your hand.

1418
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,640
Coat will get dirty.

1419
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,170
If you keep talking like this, I'll go back to orphanage.

1420
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:43,910
Hey, until now, I was controlling others.

1421
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:47,460
Now, you are controlling me? Anyway, come now.

1422
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,640
OK, let's go.

1423
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,320
How long will you take?

1424
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,260
Shouldn't I take this?
Sir, you've a letter.

1425
01:26:55,560 --> 01:27:01,430
The plane will have come and gone by the time you read that letter.
Correct we can read it there, right? Let's go.

1426
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,650
There's an announcement.

1427
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,620
The plane from Delhi IC403...

1428
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:16,320
will be delayed by 30 minutes. We regret the inconvenience caused.

1429
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:20,130
Thank god. It's 30 minutes late. Sit down.

1430
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:24,840
I can breathe now. I will read this letter before he lands.

1431
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,170
'Dear Lambodhar.'

1432
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:38,290
'I'm coming to see my son on 10th by Calcutta flight.'

1433
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:42,450
'Please bring my son M. Ganesha to the airport. Yours faithfully, Madhusudan.'

1434
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:44,450
Oh my god.

1435
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:46,450
Should he have come today itself?

1436
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:48,450
Excuse me.
Yes?

1437
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,950
When is the Calcutta flight arriving?
At 12.

1438
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,630
That means there's 2 hour difference between the two.

1439
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,430
The plane has landed. Let's go.

1440
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:10,210
Ganesha, you see that man wearing brown suit?

1441
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:16,280
He's Anand Rao. Will you go? Start now.

1442
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,290
Daddy.
My dear A. Ganesh.

1443
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,780
I'm Lambodhar.
Hello Mr. Lambodhar.

1444
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:28,440
I'm Anand Rao.
I know, I know.

1445
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:34,160
Daddy, seeing only your photo everyday, I was worried if I'll ever see you in person.

1446
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:39,120
That's why my boy. I came flying to see only you.

1447
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,360
Nose is just like mine.

1448
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:47,430
Lips are just like mine.

1449
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,630
In total you're just like me.

1450
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,730
Mr. Lambodhar, I don't know how to thank you.

1451
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:59,510
You gave me a male child to me who has only female children.

1452
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:01,510
I only did my duty.

1453
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,560
You're ecstatic seeing your son for the first time.

1454
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:07,640
Why don't we go home, relax and then talk?

1455
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,460
No, I'm sorry Mr.Lambodhar.

1456
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:11,890
I won't come home. I'll go to a hotel.

1457
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:13,160
Which hotel?

1458
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:15,510
[Hotel Ashok]

1459
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:17,320
Sir, your room number is 102.

1460
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:20,340
Thank you. Come on sonny.
Yes daddy.

1461
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,350
Take this.
Thank you sir.

1462
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:45,350
Come on sonny.

1463
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,040
Sonny, sonny, sonny.

1464
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:52,760
What's your full name?

1465
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,760
A. Ganesh.
What is A in A. Ganesh?

1466
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,170
Anand Rao Ganesh.

1467
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,440
Very good, very good.

1468
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,010
Which class are you studying in?

1469
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:01,840
1st standard.

1470
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,410
Which school?

1471
01:30:03,410 --> 01:30:05,410
Great Britain English School.

1472
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,320
But you don't talk English at all?

1473
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,650
He loves Kannada very much.

1474
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:12,200
Super, super. Show your hand.

1475
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:19,120
Mr. Anand Rao.

1476
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,070
I have to leave.
What's so urgent?

1477
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:24,640
My wife, Ganesha and I were leaving for airport.

1478
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,080
Suddenly a mad dog came and bit her.

1479
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:31,860
If I had stopped for her treatment then, we couldn't have to come to the airport.

1480
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:36,760
My wife's treatment is not as important as your visit after so many years.

1481
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:39,240
So, I left her there and came to airport.

1482
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,000
Oh, I'm so sorry. You please go and come.
Thank you.

1483
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,420
But I need to take Ganesha too.

1484
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:46,160
You have to take Ganesha too?

1485
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,570
It's not even been 10 minutes and you're separating the father and son.

1486
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:54,660
That is... Ganesha... that...
Daddy.

1487
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,060
I have to go.

1488
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:57,860
Why?

1489
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:01,430
Only I know the dog that bit auntie.

1490
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:04,290
Shouldn't I be able to show it to the doctor?
Correct.

1491
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:08,550
I haven't seen its colour, tail or face.
Is it?

1492
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:11,920
Then you can take him. Come back soon my dear.

1493
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,650
Come back soon.

1494
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,920
We'll leave.

1495
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:34,000
Ah, my dear. How crafty you are with the lies. You lie much better than me.

1496
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,160
How valuable liars are these days.

1497
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:40,840
Look, before you lie, inform me first.

1498
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,310
I'll adapt.

1499
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,840
But don't lie suddenly and put me in a fix.
Sorry boss.

1500
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,450
From now on, I'll inform you first and then lie. Now let's go.

1501
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:04,690
Uncle, why have we come to the airport again?
Like that man who came earlier...

1502
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:08,640
another will come now. You have to run and kiss him calling him daddy.

1503
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,920
I have two daddys?

1504
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,040
For now only two.

1505
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,620
Do you see? My teacher always used to say...

1506
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:16,160
when god gives you, he gives plenty.

1507
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:19,000
When I was in orphanage, I didn't have a single father..

1508
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,750
Now, I have two daddys. How is it?

1509
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,620
Plane has landed. Let's go.

1510
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,210
You see that man wearing blue suit?
Yes.

1511
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,390
He's your second daddy. Go, go.

1512
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,740
Shall I call him second daddy?
If you act smart, I'll beat you.

1513
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:46,930
I'll go back if you hit me.
Don't scare me like that at every step. Go now.

1514
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:48,530
Now that's the way you behave.
Please go now.

1515
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:51,400
I'll go in slow motion this time.
Go however you want.

1516
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:05,880
I'm Lambodhar.

1517
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,200
Very nice to meet you.
Come.

1518
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:12,630
Daddy, seeing your photo everyday until now, I was so desperate to see you in person, you know?

1519
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:14,880
I was worried if I'll ever see you.

1520
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:20,920
That's why I came flying like a bird as soon as I got time.

1521
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,750
Daddy, will you take me with you?

1522
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:27,040
I will take you. But wait for some time. Why?

1523
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,120
Isn't Lambodhar looking after you well?

1524
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,630
He is, daddy.

1525
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:36,400
He looks after me very well.

1526
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:42,600
But still there's a difference between the love of parents and others'. Isn't there?

1527
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:48,130
You son of a... He just looks small. But hot and spicy like chikkaballapur chilli.

1528
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:53,640
Why are you looking at me like that daddy?

1529
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,180
Eyes are just like mine.

1530
01:33:56,820 --> 01:33:59,030
Nose is just like mine.

1531
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:01,880
Lips look like they're cloned.

1532
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:13,030
Come, my dear come.

1533
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:17,000
Mr. Lambodhar, won't you get down?

1534
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,680
You are staying at Hotel Ashok too?

1535
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:22,180
Why? Is someone else staying here?
No, not like that.

1536
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:25,320
Everyone who comes to Bangalore stays at Ashok Hotel.

1537
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:28,420
Because it's 5 star, right?
Yes. Let's go in.

1538
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,470
Hello.
Good afternoon sir.
I'm Madhusudan from Calcutta.

1539
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:36,470
Your room number is 104 sir.

1540
01:34:37,490 --> 01:34:39,080
What is it uncle?

1541
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:44,470
One daddy in 102 and the other in 104. How do we manage?

1542
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,470
Please take the key.
Thank you.

1543
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:47,570
Come.

1544
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:58,930
Why are you standing there Mr. Lambodhar? Hey, Ganesh come.
Yes.

1545
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:06,130
Lambodhar, why were you standing there and why did you come running like this?

1546
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:08,130
Poor boy's coat was stuck there.

1547
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,160
Sir, luggage has been kept inside.
Thank you.

1548
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,500
Thank you sir.
Come boy. Please come.

1549
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:23,490
Come my dear. My dearest.

1550
01:35:23,490 --> 01:35:26,630
What do they call you in school?

1551
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,620
M. Ganesh.
M. Ganesh?

1552
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,050
Father's name is Madhusudan and my name is Ganesh.

1553
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:37,720
My dear good boy.

1554
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,250
For my dear little Ganesha,

1555
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,190
you know what I've brought?

1556
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:50,710
A train.
I always run the trains.[running trains means to tell lies]

1557
01:35:51,970 --> 01:35:55,670
A monkey to play with.
Why all that when you're there?

1558
01:35:55,670 --> 01:36:00,340
No, I mean you've come after so many years. You can play with him. Why need all those things?

1559
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:03,080
Correct. You're correct Mr. Lambodhar.

1560
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,820
What you say is 100% correct.

1561
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:07,200
I'll play with him. One minute. Excuse me.

1562
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:13,110
Daddy in 102 will be waiting for us. We have to find an excuse to leave from here.

1563
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:17,650
Do whatever you want. This daddy is better than him.

1564
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:19,650
I'll stay here.
I'll kick you.

1565
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:22,040
If you kick me, I'll go back.

1566
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:26,660
Because everything is in your hands, you are playing with me as you please?

1567
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,500
Mr. Madhusudan, Ganesha and I will go home and come back in half an hour.

1568
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:37,200
What is this Lambodhar? I'm seeing him after so many years.

1569
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,320
Not even 10 minutes have passed and you want to take him.

1570
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:45,810
I haven't turned off the gas stove at home. I fear something might happen.

1571
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:48,680
You can go for that. Why do you need Ganesh?

1572
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:54,230
Ye. I mean... Gas... Cylinder...

1573
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:59,970
Daddy, it can't be turned off if I don't go.
Why is that?

1574
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:04,070
We only have one key for our house. When auntie locks the door,

1575
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:06,360
she puts the key in the ventilator.

1576
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:10,690
Both uncle's or auntie's hand can't be put inside that.

1577
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:13,140
So, uncle lifts me up like this.

1578
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:16,770
I'll put my little hand inside and get him the key.

1579
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:22,130
We can't trust even our neighbours you see.

1580
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:25,250
You're impossible. Please go.

1581
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:26,470
But please come back soon.

1582
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:30,050
Definitely. We understand your emotion. Ganesha, let's go.

1583
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:32,280
Daddy.

1584
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:36,850
Hello, sonny. Come, come. Did you get the injection?

1585
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:39,240
Injection? Ah, yes. We got her the injection.

1586
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:43,570
Auntie cried when she got the shot. I too cried.

1587
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:45,570
Poor thing. Wait a second.

1588
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,300
Hello, room service?

1589
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:51,300
I'm speaking from 102.

1590
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,540
Please send 3 meals. South indian.

1591
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,520
Thank you.

1592
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,570
Which rank do you get in your class?

1593
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:04,960
I'm your son daddy. I always come first.
Good.

1594
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,700
Who's your best friend?
You.

1595
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:10,340
Me? Your friend? How?

1596
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:14,080
My teacher says there's no better friend than one's father.

1597
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,340
Sir, meals ready.

1598
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,140
Ganesha, lunch has arrived. Let's wash our hands.

1599
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,120
You wouldn't have eaten food like this before. Enjoy it.

1600
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,410
Yes, I will enjoy it.

1601
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:44,240
Come on my sonny.

1602
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,140
Now I'll feed you the food.

1603
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:50,180
I'll wash my hands.
Daddy order an ice cream.

1604
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:53,240
Bearer, get him an ice cream.
Yes sir.
I'll come back.

1605
01:38:57,090 --> 01:39:01,170
Ganesha, we have to find an excuse to leave after lunch.

1606
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,560
Otherwise daddy in 104 will be screaming.

1607
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:06,840
Don't worry uncle. I'll take care from here.

1608
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:15,360
Come on sonny. Shall I feed you?

1609
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:28,370
Daddy I've had enough curd rice. I'll have ice cream now.
OK.

1610
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:35,620
Daddy, I'll ask you a smart question. Will you answer?
Go ahead, ask.

1611
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,060
What is smaller than an ant?

1612
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:41,540
A thing smaller than ant...

1613
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:43,320
What is it?

1614
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,320
I don't know. You tell.

1615
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,800
Food in the ant's mouth.

1616
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,450
You haven't his smartness enough.

1617
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:54,450
He keeps asking me like this too.

1618
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:58,150
Like you, he too fails to answer any question.

1619
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:03,890
Ungrateful fellow. He insults me even when I praise him.

1620
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:08,230
Daddy, can I ask you another question?

1621
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:11,540
Who in our country has the most number of children?

1622
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,540
One with most number of children...?

1623
01:40:15,380 --> 01:40:17,430
I don't know. You tell.
Gandhiji.

1624
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,610
Why?
Because he's the father of the nation.

1625
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:26,120
Mr. Lambodhar, you have bringing up my child very well.

1626
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,640
I'm very happy.
Uncle what's the time?

1627
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,970
1:30pm.

1628
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:32,200
Oh uncle. We have to go.
Where?

1629
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:34,840
Oh uncle, you keep forgetting everything like this.

1630
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,200
Didn't I tell you that my teacher Mary is having a surgery?
Oh yes.

1631
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,270
I forgot.

1632
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:40,710
Is she? What operation?

1633
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,780
Stomach operation.

1634
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:46,000
We were instructed to come and pray at the hospital. Weren't we?

1635
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,420
Yes, yes Mr. Anand Rao. Wash your hands and come quickly.

1636
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:50,420
Oh, what an unlucky day to come.

1637
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:53,860
I'm not able to pass even half an hour with him. Anyway...

1638
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:58,500
Mr. Lambodhar, you're going to a hospital. Please buy some fruits.
Sure.

1639
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,640
Thank you.
My daddy is so good. I'll come back soon daddy.

1640
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:08,480
My precious. Works like a computer when lying.

1641
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,140
This is what I've to do when I'm with people like you.

1642
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:17,480
Hello Mister. GIve me that 100 rupees.

1643
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,790
Why?
Because it's mine.

1644
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,940
Yes, yours. Your father's.
Yes, it's my father's.

1645
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,380
Who's your father?

1646
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:27,160
Is he not my father?

1647
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,940
Then let me go back to...
I didn't say like that.

1648
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:34,230
Then what did you mean? Didn't I get that because I lied about my teacher?

1649
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:35,920
So, it's mine. Give it to me.

1650
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,780
You've become wise. But how long will you do this? Only 3 days. Take this.

1651
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:43,520
Hello, let's take 50-50.

1652
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:46,440
Come.
OK.

1653
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:50,400
Oh, Mr. Lambodhar. Please come.

1654
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,350
I was desperate for my boy.

1655
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:57,250
Hello, room service? Send 3 meals urgently to 104.

1656
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:59,010
Lunch?

1657
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:01,280
Why are you so scared of meals?

1658
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:05,040
No excuses.

1659
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:10,500
I have this golden opportunity of having a meal with my son. How can I lose it?

1660
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:13,940
You're right daddy. I too want to have lunch with you.

1661
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:17,110
Very good my son. This is the love a son must havefor his father.

1662
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:23,030
Come Lambodhar. Please sit down.

1663
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:27,620
I'll feed my son with my own hands. I'll wash my hands and be back.

1664
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:46,080
What's this sir? You'll have this too?

1665
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:47,940
To keep your mouth shut.

1666
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,090
My dear.

1667
01:42:54,690 --> 01:42:59,240
Sit down.
Daddy, I won't have much. I can't eat too much.

1668
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:02,710
You've grown so lean because of your shyness.

1669
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,810
These guys aren't shy.

1670
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:08,480
They just now ate like hungry cows in that room.

1671
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,630
You want ice cream too?

1672
01:43:10,630 --> 01:43:13,220
Get lost.

1673
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,450
I'm suffering here.

1674
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,040
You look like that when somebody's eating?

1675
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:24,160
Your evil eye will harm them.

1676
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:26,160
That is right.

1677
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:29,890
If you eat like this, why just evil eye, even the stomach will burst.

1678
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,570
What is this M. Ganesha? Is there where you vomit?

1679
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:39,220
It's Ok. He's only a child.

1680
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:43,000
Hey, what are you looking at? The child has vomited because of your evil eye. Go clean it.

1681
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:46,960
These people eat at 2-3 places and vomit.

1682
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,430
But I have to clean it up.
Quick.

1683
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:53,400
Come, I'll wash your face.
No, no. I'll wash.

1684
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:56,150
It's OK.
No, no. I'll wash his face.

1685
01:43:56,150 --> 01:44:00,180
Come boy. Are you alright?

1686
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:03,380
He loves the kid so much.

1687
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:07,270
Ganesha, if we are at the same place together, it'll be a problem.

1688
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:09,700
So, when you're here, I'll be there.

1689
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:11,700
When you're there, I'll be here.

1690
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:15,510
But what will we tell him now to escape from here?
I'll manage that.

1691
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:20,000
M. Ganesha, now go play in the lift.

1692
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,630
Playing in the lift?

1693
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:25,730
Kids like going up and down in the lifts. Don't you?

1694
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:30,240
We don't have lift in our home. He can play until you're staying here.

1695
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:33,910
Go play for half an hour and come back.
Thank you daddy.

1696
01:44:33,910 --> 01:44:35,910
Go now. Good boy.

1697
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:43,170
Daddy.
Oh, my boy. You came back.

1698
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:45,250
Did your teacher undergo surgery?

1699
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:48,070
It's still going on. We have to go again at 6.

1700
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:51,480
You have to go again at 6? This is quite a problem.

1701
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,930
Where is your Lambodhar uncle?

1702
01:44:52,930 --> 01:44:58,630
He said he'll come in half an hour and asked me to be with you.
Is it?

1703
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:03,650
Now, we two can play and spend time alone.

1704
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,020
You see Mr. Lambodhar.

1705
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:10,550
God gave me the right punishment for all my sins.

1706
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:12,550
What are you saying Mr. Madhusudan?

1707
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,960
Yes Lambodhar.

1708
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:20,770
That day... in my intoxicated state... I slept with Gowri in the wedding suite.

1709
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:24,200
I went back to Calcutta because I couldn't face her.

1710
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:28,870
I wrote a letter asking for forgiveness.

1711
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,370
I may have run away. But god didn't leave me alone.

1712
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:34,720
Gowri gave birth to a child.

1713
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:38,000
Taking full responsibility, I should've raised that child.

1714
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:43,300
Even then, I didn't do my duty and burdened you.

1715
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:47,460
That's why, god has given me a punishment that only I can experience.

1716
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:49,160
What punishment?

1717
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:52,340
Lambodhar, I have liver cancer.

1718
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:53,910
Is it?

1719
01:45:53,910 --> 01:45:55,910
Oh god.

1720
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:58,600
Until now Ganesha didn't have only his mother.

1721
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:01,730
Now he has lost his father too, Mr. Madhusudan.

1722
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:05,640
What are you talking Mr. Lambodhar? I'm not dead.

1723
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:08,660
Yes. You must not die sir.

1724
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:10,950
But this cancer is also very deadly.

1725
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:12,450
That wouldn't let you live.

1726
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:15,280
I'm come here because of that uncertainty.

1727
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:18,020
I undergoing surgery next week.

1728
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:22,000
I'll live or die. I don't know.

1729
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,460
So, I've seen all my relatives.

1730
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,880
He was the last one.

1731
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:30,440
So, I came to see him.

1732
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:34,550
If I die, he inherits all my wealth.

1733
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:36,550
I have written everything in his name.

1734
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,720
May this fellow die soon.

1735
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:42,580
What are you thinking Lambodhar?

1736
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,890
I'll leave something for you too.

1737
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:48,800
No, I wasn't thinking about it Mr. Madhusudan.

1738
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,800
I was praying for something else.

1739
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:56,840
You wish good for others. So, god will listen to your prayers.

1740
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:59,030
Please bring my son back.

1741
01:46:59,030 --> 01:47:02,440
Let him come and play with me too.

1742
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:06,770
I'll bring him, but don't tell all these things to him.

1743
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,770
Ganesha, lift is empty. Go and play if you want.

1744
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:11,960
Lift? Why?

1745
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:17,520
Daddy, I like going up and down in the lift. That's why.

1746
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,780
OK. Go play for half an hour and come back.

1747
01:47:21,650 --> 01:47:24,280
A. Ganesh is completely like me.

1748
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,160
He's your son, isn't he?
Yes.

1749
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:29,160
Daddy, I'll ask you question. Will you answer?

1750
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:33,380
Crows sit on all statues in our country.

1751
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:37,440
But they won't sit on Gandhi's statue. Why?

1752
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,440
Hmm, Why...?

1753
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:44,930
Ah, they respect him for getting our country its independence.

1754
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:48,630
Oh you're an idiot. Do crows read the history books?

1755
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:51,620
Oh, yes. Then why?

1756
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:56,800
You lost?
I lost the day a brilliant boy like you was born. Tell me why.

1757
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,400
Gandhi has a stick in his hand, right? So, they fear that.

1758
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:05,750
I'll ask another?
OK.

1759
01:48:05,750 --> 01:48:11,480
When Rajiv Gandhi bathes, this hand won't get wet. How's that possible?

1760
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:15,640
Hmm, how? Ah, He'll have lifted his hand.
No, it'll be down.

1761
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:19,380
It'll be down? Ah, he'll wrapped plastic around the hand.

1762
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:21,970
Does he have a broken arm to wrap plastic around it?

1763
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:24,690
I don't know. You tell.

1764
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:26,360
You lost?
Yes, I lost.

1765
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:31,280
When Rajiv Gandhi bathes, how'll this hand be wet? Isn't this my hand?

1766
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:36,920
You're impossible.

1767
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:39,170
I'll ask another?
No, that's enough.

1768
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:43,640
You are making me a fool by asking these questions.
You already are a fool, daddy.

1769
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:45,640
You'll become again. Shall I ask one more?

1770
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,640
What is taken in light but created in dark?

1771
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:53,680
What is created in dark?

1772
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:54,820
Photo.

1773
01:48:57,220 --> 01:49:00,040
Shall we go and get a picture taken?

1774
01:49:00,370 --> 01:49:02,640
Oh my god. Mr. Lambodhar.

1775
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:05,200
It's been quite a while since he went to play.

1776
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:07,860
What if he gets stuck in the middle?

1777
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:10,850
Please bring him back.
OK. I'll get him.

1778
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:23,520
Where did they go now?

1779
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,430
I don't know what misfortune awaits me.

1780
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:30,770
Chandramouli.
Chandru dear.

1781
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:33,730
Chandramouli.
Hey who are you?

1782
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:35,040
Why are you barging in like this?

1783
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,660
Where is our Chandru?

1784
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:37,990
Chandru? Which Chandru?

1785
01:49:37,990 --> 01:49:39,400
Our Mouli.

1786
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,880
You see, there's no Mouli or Moole[bone] here.

1787
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:44,980
Who are you?
Chandramouli's grandparents.

1788
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:46,980
But who's Chandramouli?

1789
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:50,480
Our Grandson.
Arey, why would your grandson be here?

1790
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:54,070
This is Lambodhar's house?
Yes.

1791
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:58,500
Then don't play around. Please call him.
We're desperate to meet him.

1792
01:49:58,500 --> 01:50:00,760
Are you mad or what?

1793
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:05,830
You come into my house and ask for Chandramouli. Where will I bring him from?

1794
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:07,410
Are you joking?

1795
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:11,300
Who are you?
She must be the maid.

1796
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,440
Hey old woman. You come to my house and call me a house maid?

1797
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,300
I'm the owner of this house.

1798
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,930
Lambodhar's wife.

1799
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,460
Why didn't you tell us before?

1800
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:23,890
But you say that you don't know Chandramouli?

1801
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:30,400
I can tell you if I know any.
I'm talking about the kid Lambodhar's raising. Chandramouli's son Chandramouli.

1802
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,870
You're really mad.

1803
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:35,970
Chandramouli's son Chandramouli. How's that possible?

1804
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:40,770
She must be crazy.
Why bother with her?
That's right.

1805
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:42,770
Where's Lambodhar?

1806
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:45,990
Somebody called Anand Rao. A crazy man like you had written a letter.

1807
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:48,500
That he wanted Lambodhar to bring a boy to the airport.

1808
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:52,070
Then later he got hold of a boy and has taken him there.

1809
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:54,340
Is it?

1810
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,560
Vishalakshi, there's something fishy in this.

1811
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:01,190
We shall not leave until Lambodhara comes back. Sit down.

1812
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,620
Where were you until now?

1813
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:13,280
I had taken him out.

1814
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,570
Oh, then it's OK.

1815
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:19,520
I've had Ganesha with me for so many years.

1816
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,520
I can't live without even for a minute.

1817
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:26,020
My heart keeps pounding until he returns.
Of course, that is sentiment.

1818
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:33,060
How will I manage if you keep spending so much time with each man?

1819
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:36,710
While you were with him, 102 daddy is chanting your name there.

1820
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:40,370
You're only thinking about this one point. Have you thought about another thing?

1821
01:51:40,370 --> 01:51:41,330
What is it?

1822
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:48,480
With whom shall I sleep tonight? If both ask for me, what will I do?

1823
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,920
Oh yes. We shall work out something. Come.

1824
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:53,620
Hey Ganesha. Why are going to that room?

1825
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,430
Oh this isn't our room.

1826
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:57,090
Oh god.

1827
01:51:57,380 --> 01:52:00,080
Uncle 102 is there.

1828
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,840
Oh you're silly. You're going into other's room.

1829
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,690
All rooms look the same in this hotel. Couldn't recognise.
You're right.

1830
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:13,110
Just like my son and I are.

1831
01:52:13,110 --> 01:52:16,450
When you two are enjoying, why bother you? I'll come back after some time.

1832
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:18,080
OK, come on sonny.

1833
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:25,400
Come Lambodhar.

1834
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:28,000
Where is my son M. Ganesh?
He's playing in the lift.

1835
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:30,580
He's crazy about these lifts, huh?

1836
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:32,340
Mr. Madhusudan.

1837
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:35,220
I wanted to ask you something.
Yes.

1838
01:52:35,220 --> 01:52:37,220
According to my sister,

1839
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:40,720
you have a habit of drinking at night.

1840
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,470
It would be good if you didn't drink tonight.

1841
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:46,920
That's not at all possible Mr. Lambodhar.

1842
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,920
I can live without anything.

1843
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,800
But I can't live without it.

1844
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:55,970
I have raised Ganesha with discipline and good habits.

1845
01:52:56,210 --> 01:53:03,570
I have told him that smoking and drinking are bad habits. And those who do that are bad people.

1846
01:53:03,730 --> 01:53:07,040
If he sees you smoking or drinking,

1847
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,400
he might get scared and not come near you at all.

1848
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,510
So...

1849
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:13,480
Yes you're correct Mr. Lambodhar.

1850
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,520
Whatever bad things we do...

1851
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,520
we must not do it in front of children.

1852
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,320
It'll have an effect on them.

1853
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,170
So, you...

1854
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:24,290
take Ganesha with you during night. And bring him here during day.

1855
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:26,770
I would if you don't mind.

1856
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:29,560
Not at all.

1857
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:33,170
Hello.

1858
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:34,690
Yes, Anand Rao here.

1859
01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:36,800
It's me, receptionist Rita.

1860
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,530
Oh Rita.

1861
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:40,760
How did you know I was here?

1862
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:45,220
Wouldn't a hotel receptionist know who are staying in the hotel?

1863
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:48,080
You are alone or with company?

1864
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:51,440
No, no. I don't want any company tonight.

1865
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:54,720
When did you become an ascetic?

1866
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:57,410
Nothing like that.

1867
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:59,890
That is...
No excuses.

1868
01:53:59,890 --> 01:54:03,330
Vishwamitras like you cannot escape until there are Menakas like us.

1869
01:54:03,590 --> 01:54:07,330
My work finishes at 8:30. I'll come to your room at 8:45, OK?

1870
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:09,330
OK.

1871
01:54:09,730 --> 01:54:11,330
Mr. Anand Rao.

1872
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:12,720
I'm going home.

1873
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:17,560
You can keep Ganesha with you and listen to his sweet voice all night.
No, no.

1874
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:20,560
No. He's used to sleeping with you.

1875
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,340
He may feel uncomfortable sleeping with others.

1876
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:25,400
No, Ganesha shall adjust.
It's not like that Mr. Lambodhar.

1877
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:30,210
My business partners are coming tonight.
Oh, business partners.
So, if you don't mind.

1878
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:33,330
Keep him with you tonight. Bring him here in the morning.

1879
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:35,490
As you please sir. Ganesha Shall we leave?

1880
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,720
Come.
Thank god. You finally came.

1881
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:43,140
I thought you'd stay with Anand Rao all night.
Why are upset today?

1882
01:54:44,020 --> 01:54:46,610
Whose car is this?
Two bufoons have come into our house.

1883
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:49,080
Purnananda Rao and Vishalakshamma.

1884
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,240
They too have come today?

1885
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:55,280
They haven't just come. They've been eating my head all day long asking for Chandramouli.

1886
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,680
So what did you tell them?

1887
01:54:56,680 --> 01:55:06,280
I told them this is not an orphanage to provide Ganesha and Chandramouli to anybody who comes asking.

1888
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:09,440
You mean you've told them everything.

1889
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,640
I thought they'll go then. But they didn't.

1890
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:13,750
Oh god.
What happened?

1891
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,980
Sarsu, you want me to live longer, right?

1892
01:55:18,150 --> 01:55:21,270
Yes.
You want this marriage life to be long, right?
Yes.

1893
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:24,790
Then do me a favour. Don't come into the house for half an hour.

1894
01:55:24,790 --> 01:55:26,520
Please do not come.

1895
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,320
Is that all?

1896
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:31,160
I have married after so many difficulties.

1897
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:36,870
Why half hour? I can sleep at the gate all night long if you want.

1898
01:55:36,870 --> 01:55:43,890
Wow, Ahalya, Tara, Sita and Mandodari are nothing in front you and your devotion to your husband.

1899
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:51,880
Sarsu, go and have a chat with that Gangu for some time. Why do you have to stand at the gate?

1900
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,880
Ok then, I'll leave.
Bye.

1901
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:59,460
Ganesha, I need another help from you.

1902
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:01,040
What is this new problem?

1903
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:06,210
There's an old couple sitting inside. You have to hug and call them grandpa and grandma.

1904
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:09,190
I have grandparents too?

1905
01:56:09,190 --> 01:56:15,860
Whose parents are they? Anand Rao's or Madhusudan's?
Neither.

1906
01:56:15,860 --> 01:56:18,180
They are Chandramouli's parents.

1907
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:21,090
Chandramouli? What's this new name?

1908
01:56:21,090 --> 01:56:23,510
Chandramouli is your father.

1909
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:26,020
I have another father?
Yes.

1910
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:30,100
He has come here too?
He isn't alive to come. He has been dead for a long time.

1911
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:31,640
Poor fellow.

1912
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:35,330
Now I have one dead daddy, and two living ones.

1913
01:56:35,330 --> 01:56:39,540
With that, the grandparents. Totally I'm doing a triple role like in the film Shankarguru, huh?

1914
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:41,160
My name is Ganesha here too?

1915
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,160
No, here your name is Chandramouli.

1916
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:46,290
Ok. The same acting I did at the airport.

1917
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:48,640
But I should call them grandpa and grandma, right?

1918
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:51,140
Yes, but there's another point here.
What's that?

1919
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:53,650
Your auntie has told them everything.

1920
01:56:53,650 --> 01:56:56,210
Now that has to become all lies right?

1921
01:56:56,210 --> 01:56:58,630
We'll make auntie crazy. Ok, come.

1922
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:03,720
Lambodhar has come.

1923
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:05,720
Namaskara.
Namaskara.

1924
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:10,920
I'm Purananda Rao and my wife Vishalakshi.

1925
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:11,730
Namaskara.
Namaskara.

1926
01:57:11,730 --> 01:57:13,510
Why are you sitting here? Come inside.

1927
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:16,340
Please come.

1928
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:19,320
When did you come?
This afternoon.
Please sit down.

1929
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:23,120
Chandramouli, these are your grandparents.

1930
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,220
Come here dear. Come.

1931
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:28,480
No, I won't. I'm angry with you.

1932
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:34,440
Look there. He looks exactly like our son Chandramouli when he's angry.
Yes.

1933
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:39,220
Why are you angry?
You haven't come to take me these many years.

1934
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:42,240
What do to dear? We are living in far away Punjab.

1935
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:44,340
There's terrorrist problem everyday.

1936
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:47,430
What if something happens to our sweet boy?

1937
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:49,160
That's why we didn't come.

1938
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,740
Come dear.
No, I won't.

1939
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:53,030
Go dear.

1940
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:56,440
Don't you keep asking for your grandparents in sleep?

1941
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:57,700
Does he?
Yes.

1942
01:57:57,700 --> 01:57:59,960
Poor boy. Whenever he sees old people,

1943
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:03,460
he asks if his grandparents are like them.

1944
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:07,120
You love us so much? Oh, come here my sweet boy.

1945
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:11,560
Only I love you. You don't love me at all.

1946
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:15,280
If we don't love you, would we have come from so far just to see you?

1947
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:17,280
Come on smile.

1948
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:21,010
Come on smile my sweet...

1949
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:25,330
Nose is just like our Chandramouli.

1950
01:58:25,330 --> 01:58:28,520
Look at the ears. They're wide just like Chandramouli's.

1951
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:31,410
Grandpa, auntie didn't hit you, did she?

1952
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:34,160
She probably would've if we had lingered here. Why do you ask?

1953
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:38,340
Auntie is a bit crazy. She's like that since the day got bit by a mad dog.

1954
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:41,380
Is she? But she talks all normal?

1955
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:44,710
She'll be normal. She does all the cooking and everything well.

1956
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:47,400
But when asked to serve, she puts it on our head.

1957
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,830
She keeps calling me with different names.

1958
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:54,000
She calls him Ganesha or Subbu. When he doesn't answer, she beats him.

1959
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,510
Poor woman.

1960
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:57,300
You should've consulted a doctor.

1961
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:01,860
We consulted, grandpa.
We did. She was given injection, shock treatment and everything. Nothing worked.

1962
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:04,520
Grandpa, would you take me with you?

1963
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:07,060
We'll take you. But not now.

1964
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:10,550
As soon as we come here and settle down, we'll take you.

1965
01:59:10,550 --> 01:59:11,650
Is it OK?

1966
01:59:11,650 --> 01:59:16,880
Why don't you stay at our house until you're here?
Why not?

1967
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:20,680
What if his wife goes nuts and hit us?

1968
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:23,520
Yes, you're right. Mr. Lambodhar.

1969
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:27,270
Why do you take trouble? We've already booked a room in a hotel.

1970
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:30,420
We'll have Chandramouli with us there.
OK.

1971
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:31,920
Which hotel?

1972
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,920
Hotel Ashok.

1973
01:59:37,010 --> 01:59:39,280
Purnananda Rao. Sir your room number is 106.

1974
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:43,090
Arey, Lambodhar, what happened?

1975
01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:47,990
It's 5 star hotel right? Mosaic floor is a bit too smooth. I slipped.

1976
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:49,880
Give me the key.

1977
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:52,040
Why are you worried uncle?

1978
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:56,630
Then what? All the planets are in the same place, 102, 104 and 106.

1979
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:00,020
Don't worry uncle. I'm there.

1980
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:03,160
Anyway we have this lift game to play. I'll manage somehow.

1981
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:04,560
See what happens tomorrow.

1982
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:25,030
Daddy, daddy,daddy...

1983
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:27,090
You and I are a pair.

1984
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:30,610
My dear daddy, I love you.

1985
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:34,610
Daddy, daddy, daddy. You and I are a pair.

1986
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:38,200
My dear daddy, I love you.

1987
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:42,080
My dear daddy, I like you.

1988
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:19,780
Grandpa, I'll go elephant safari on your back.

1989
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:27,240
I'm the Mysore Raja and you're my ride.

1990
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:34,210
Grandpa, I'll go elephant safari on your back.

1991
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:37,750
I'm the Mysore Raja and you're my ride.

1992
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:41,670
We'll organise Dasara and have a durbar.

1993
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:45,480
We'll go on a procession in a jumbo ride.

1994
02:01:56,900 --> 02:02:00,630
Choo choo train has come. We'll all get on it.

1995
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:04,200
We'll see Bombay and come back.

1996
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:07,910
We'll go to studio and get a picture taken.

1997
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:11,880
We'll go to park and play hide and seek.

1998
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:15,430
And pass time playing in the park.

1999
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:18,980
Grandma [Ajji], Banana fritters [bajji],

2000
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:22,680
Rub [Ujji] your cheek to my cheek, I love you.

2001
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:26,420
Grandpa [Taata], Oh you glutton [tindi pota],

2002
02:02:26,420 --> 02:02:30,610
Eat this chow-chow bath, I love you.

2003
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:34,230
My dear grandpa, I like you.

2004
02:03:00,370 --> 02:03:02,180
Come here daddy.

2005
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:04,180
Come sit down.

2006
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:07,760
Tie this around your eyes.

2007
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:11,830
Find out where I am now.

2008
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:14,340
Daddy.

2009
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:17,940
Not there, come here.

2010
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:26,440
To jolly, to pass time,

2011
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:30,150
let's play I spy.

2012
02:03:30,150 --> 02:03:33,940
Count 1,2 ...100.

2013
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:37,920
I'll hide and you count.

2014
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:41,490
And find me out, daddy.

2015
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:45,280
Daddy, daddy, daddy, You and I are a pair.

2016
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:48,980
My dear daddy, I love you.

2017
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:52,950
Daddy, daddy, daddy, You and I are a pair.

2018
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:56,520

My dear daddy, I like you.

2020
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,080
May I help you?

2021
02:04:14,230 --> 02:04:16,130
Thank you. Your good name please.

2022
02:04:16,130 --> 02:04:18,180
I'm Anand Rao.
I'm Madhusudan.

2023
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:20,180
Nice meeting you.
Pleasure is mine.

2024
02:04:20,290 --> 02:04:22,480
Are you staying here?
Yes, yes.

2025
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:25,840
I'm in 104.
Are you? I'm in 102.

2026
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,120
Are you here on business?
No,no.

2027
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:31,380
I've come from Calcutta to see my son.

2028
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:35,880
Is it? I too have come to see my son from Washington.

2029
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:38,660
How nice. Is he studying here?
Yes.

2030
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:40,150
In Great Britain English School.

2031
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:42,150
My son is also goes there.

2032
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:44,000
Is it? My son is in 1st standard.

2033
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Oh, my son too is in 1st standard.

2034
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:47,700
Your son's name?

2035
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:50,710
A. Ganesh.
Oh, my son's name is M. Ganesh.

2036
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:54,000
Both sons' name are same but initials are different.

2037
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,260
They may be close friends.
Maybe.

2038
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:59,990
Anyhow, we've become friends now.
Yes, you're right.

2039
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:02,760
You must meet my son once.

2040
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:05,880
You too must meet my son.

2041
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:07,460
Such a lovely boy.

2042
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:10,850
Ok, then. When will you introduce me to your son?
When?

2043
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:13,760
I'm going back to Calcutta tomorrow by 12:30 flight.

2044
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:16,370
He has this damned school inspection till 12.

2045
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:18,500
When will I introduce you?

2046
02:05:18,500 --> 02:05:19,940
It's the same with my son.

2047
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:21,940
I'm leaving by 1:30 flight.

2048
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:23,750
It'll be 12:30 by the time he comes here.

2049
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:25,750
You too won't be here.
OK.

2050
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:28,440
We shall meet when time permits.
Excuse me sir.

2051
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:29,430
You have a phone call.

2052
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:31,080
Phone? I'll attend the phone.

2053
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:33,300
I'll in bar. If you get time...

2054
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:35,970
Ok, OK.

2055
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:38,480
Come.

2056
02:05:40,070 --> 02:05:41,510
Please sit down there. There.

2057
02:05:45,810 --> 02:05:46,580
Come.

2058
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:56,400
Grandpa.
What is it child?

2059
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,400
Grandma.
What is it boy?

2060
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,200
I want an ice cream.

2061
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:01,810
You want an ice cream?

2062
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:04,520
Our Chandramouli was also just like him, right?

2063
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:08,930
He used to pester me for ice cream.

2064
02:06:08,930 --> 02:06:10,930
My gold.

2065
02:06:10,930 --> 02:06:12,930
My gold nugget.

2066
02:06:19,960 --> 02:06:20,930
Thank you.

2067
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:22,500
Take this.

2068
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:28,690
Hey Madhu.

2069
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:33,430
You know Madhu?

2070
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:36,070
Do I know him? He's my son's close friend.

2071
02:06:36,070 --> 02:06:38,070
Hey, why are you sitting there. Come here.

2072
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:46,260
What Madhu? How are you?

2073
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:50,340
Sit down. He's our grandson.
Hi, uncle.

2074
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:57,780
What are you looking at?

2075
02:06:57,780 --> 02:06:59,780
He's our Chandramouli's son.

2076
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:01,330
Isn't he just like him?

2077
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:06,630
Mr. Lambodhar, I want to talk to you.

2078
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:07,840
Sure.
Would you come aside?

2079
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,880
Excuse me. Two minutes.

2080
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:12,280
Come back soon.

2081
02:07:17,090 --> 02:07:18,280
What is this?

2082
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:19,280
What sir?

2083
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:23,510
They're calling my son their grandson in front of me.

2084
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:25,720
It pains me so much.

2085
02:07:25,720 --> 02:07:28,210
It pains me 10 times more, Mr. Madhusudan.

2086
02:07:28,210 --> 02:07:32,080
But to keep my family's prestige intact, I have to do this drama.

2087
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,280
Drama, why?

2088
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:34,340
What else should I do?

2089
02:07:34,450 --> 02:07:37,640
They don't know that the marriage between Gowri and Chandramouli was fake.

2090
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:40,200
They believe the child is born of Gowri and Chandramouli.

2091
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:44,310
So, they keep asking me for the child.

2092
02:07:44,310 --> 02:07:46,930
Why don't you tell them directly that it's not theirs?

2093
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:48,930
What shall I tell if they ask who it belongs to?

2094
02:07:48,930 --> 02:07:51,460
Should I say, when Gowri was sleeping in the wedding suite,

2095
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:56,800
Your son's friend Madhusudan came and raped her and the child is born of that rape?

2096
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:57,750
Should I tell that?

2097
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:03,510
Why are you silent now? Please tell me sir.

2098
02:08:03,510 --> 02:08:06,950
To protect my honour, your honour, my sister's honour and my family's honour,

2099
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:10,260
and to console those old couple hearts, I'm doing all this.

2100
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:12,850
That poor boy too has to act in this.

2101
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:17,220
Please think. How sad the boy must have been to call you uncle in front of them.

2102
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:19,220
So, I'll stop this today.

2103
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:21,920
I'll tell them that this is not your grandson.

2104
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:26,680
I'll tell them that this is a child born out of a rape. Come what may.
No, Lambodhar. Please.

2105
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:27,960
Don't get excited.

2106
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:31,300
I can understand that whatever you're doing is for my benefit.

2107
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:36,660
Look, if they believe that my son is their grandson, I won't mind.
Thank you sir.

2108
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:39,360
That's why you're such a big man. Come sir.

2109
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:41,960
I have one request.

2110
02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:45,410
Don't forget to bring my son to the airport.

2111
02:08:45,410 --> 02:08:49,620
Because I want to see him waving goodbye while I'm flying.

2112
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,400
Done sir. Come sir.

2113
02:08:56,470 --> 02:08:58,280
Hi uncle. Did you finish talking?

2114
02:08:59,140 --> 02:09:01,120
It's over my dear child. It's over.

2115
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:04,200
But when did you comea and where are you staying now?

2116
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,930
I have a chemical factory in Calcutta.

2117
02:09:06,930 --> 02:09:09,760
I had come here some business. I'm going tomorrow.

2118
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:12,720
Are you? We're also going to Amritsar tomorrow.

2119
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,600
Is it? I have some urgent business to look into. I'll leave.

2120
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:17,460
See you my child.
Bye uncle.

2121
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:19,120
Bye.
Bye, bye.

2122
02:09:20,690 --> 02:09:22,480
No. Mr. Purnananda Rao.

2123
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,340
Shall I take Chandramouli with me?

2124
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:29,350
I told you about the inspection.
Why did this damn inspection have to happen now?

2125
02:09:29,750 --> 02:09:33,600
Please bring him in the morning as soon as the inspection gets over.
Sure, sure.

2126
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:34,310
Come.

2127
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,310
Come tomorrow.

2128
02:09:40,950 --> 02:09:42,820
I'll leave grandpa. I'll leave grandma.

2129
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:10,900
Namaskara.

2130
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:13,350
Please come Mr. Lambodhar.

2131
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:16,200
Take your boy. I have brought him back at the correct time.

2132
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:18,790
Thank you sir. Ganesha, go have food.

2133
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:43,880
Uncle.

2134
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:46,210
What is it dear?

2135
02:10:46,210 --> 02:10:52,480
Orphans like don't know what father's or grandparents' love is like.

2136
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:57,680
You let me experience that love for at least three days. Thank you. I'll go.

2137
02:11:00,930 --> 02:11:04,310
Don't think that love ends at these three days, Ganesha.

2138
02:11:04,450 --> 02:11:06,500
I'll give you that forever.

2139
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:09,080
You have won my heart.

2140
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:13,600
I'll come tomorrow and adopt you.

2141
02:11:14,150 --> 02:11:18,420
Those are not your daddy whom you called until today.

2142
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:20,120
From this moment,

2143
02:11:20,230 --> 02:11:21,440
I'm your daddy.

2144
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:24,690
Is it true, uncle?
Not uncle, child. Daddy.

2145
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:30,790
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...
Ganesha.

2146
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:36,200
This is a special announcement.

2147
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:39,060
Due to the runway problem,

2148
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:41,570
all planes departing from here,

2149
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:45,800
are delayed by 3 hours. We regret the inconvenience caused.

2150
02:11:46,680 --> 02:11:47,800
It's good.

2151
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:52,840
If my son comes back from the inspection, I can spend 3 hours with him.

2152
02:11:58,280 --> 02:11:59,440
Bring the luggage inside.

2153
02:12:07,620 --> 02:12:08,960
Hello, Mr. Madhusudan.

2154
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:11,190
Hello, Mr. Anand Rao.

2155
02:12:11,190 --> 02:12:13,350
Why are you still here? Flight's delayed?

2156
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:16,000
Not just late. There's runway problem.

2157
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,120
All flights are delayed.
Oh my god.

2158
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:20,420
You said you'd bring your son. Where is he?

2159
02:12:20,420 --> 02:12:23,400
He has inspection till 12:30 and I had flight at 1:30.

2160
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:24,960
I feared I might miss and came here.

2161
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,390
Probably Lambodhar would bring him.

2162
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:29,840
Where's your son?
It's the same with him.

2163
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:33,410
They haven't come thinking I might have left already.

2164
02:12:42,950 --> 02:12:45,460
Bring the luggage. Come.

2165
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:54,120
Madhu is here.

2166
02:12:54,610 --> 02:12:56,370
You haven't left Madhu?

2167
02:12:56,530 --> 02:12:59,890
No, there's runway problem. All flights are delayed by 3 hours.

2168
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:03,480
Then come. We shall bring our Chandramouli.

2169
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:05,220
We can spend 3 hours with him.

2170
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:09,190
No. It won't do good if we leave and they come here. Let's wait here.

2171
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:11,190
Sir, he's Anand Rao.

2172
02:13:11,190 --> 02:13:14,420
We became friends in Ashok Hotel.
Hello.

2173
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:16,870
He's Purnananda Rao. My friend's father.

2174
02:13:16,870 --> 02:13:19,270
I see. You seem to be waiting for someone?

2175
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:22,790
My grandson. He's supposed to come after the inspection at his school is completed.

2176
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,800
Inspection? Which school is he in?
Great Britain English School.

2177
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:29,700
Oh my son's school. What's your grandson's name?

2178
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:30,720
Chandramouli.

2179
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:33,680
Anyway, all three children of ours are studying there.

2180
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:35,680
All three children?
Yes sir.

2181
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:38,160
My son, A. Ganesh. His son M. Ganesh.

2182
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:39,720
Your grandson Chandramouli.

2183
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:41,830
Madhu, you've a son?

2184
02:13:41,830 --> 02:13:43,760
You didn't tell us you got married?

2185
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:45,560
It's a different story.

2186
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:47,320
He says it's a different story.

2187
02:13:47,590 --> 02:13:49,620
They believe my son to be their grandson.

2188
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:52,660
Madhu, have you put your son in any hostel?

2189
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:56,150
No, not in hostel. He's staying in a home of someone I know.

2190
02:13:56,150 --> 02:13:59,200
Me too. Left in hostel, boys get spoiled.

2191
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:02,120
That's why I have arranged for his stay at Mr. Lambodhar's place.

2192
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:07,000
Your son A. Ganesh is staying with Lambodhar?

2193
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:10,120
My grandson Chandramouli is also studying at Lambodhar's place.

2194
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:12,290
A. Ganesh, M. Ganesh and Chandramouli.

2195
02:14:12,290 --> 02:14:14,150
All three are with Lambodhar.

2196
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:15,970
Mr. Anand Rao, there's something fishy here.

2197
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:17,970
No, no. He's not like that.

2198
02:14:17,970 --> 02:14:21,110
Why worry? We'll ask him when he brings our grandson.

2199
02:14:21,570 --> 02:14:23,990
I'm doubtful he might come.

2200
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:26,740
You have your grandson's photo with you?
Show it.

2201
02:14:31,570 --> 02:14:32,840
This is my son A. Ganesh.

2202
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:34,840
This is my son M. Ganesh.

2203
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:36,580
This is our grandson Chandramouli.

2204
02:14:37,810 --> 02:14:41,190
Oh, then we've all been fooled.

2205
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:44,000
Let the flight be cancelled but we shouldn't let him go.

2206
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:56,820
Why do you look worried Lambodhar?

2207
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:58,560
Come inside.
Come inside.

2208
02:14:59,190 --> 02:15:01,030
We're being welcomed in our own house.

2209
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:03,990
You didn't bring our grandson to airport.

2210
02:15:04,230 --> 02:15:06,050
We didn't feel like going.

2211
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:08,980
We cancelled the flight tickets.
Oh!

2212
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,200
This is true love.

2213
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:17,030
Chandramouli is very lucky to have grandparents like you.

2214
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:18,230
Yes, yes.

2215
02:15:18,950 --> 02:15:22,150
He's lucky to have father like me, right?

2216
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:24,600
Take your video cassette.

2217
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:29,910
You have sent us the video copy some other child's naming ceremony?

2218
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:32,960
Thank god. At least we got to know your plan today.

2219
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:35,800
I would've written my property in your name.

2220
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:37,440
Take your cassette.

2221
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:40,960
We didn't bring our cassette. Otherwise we would've thrown it at your face.

2222
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:43,910
What is this drama?

2223
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:45,110
Why are you doing this?

2224
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:47,830
You don't know anything?

2225
02:15:47,830 --> 02:15:49,910
You three have planned this together.

2226
02:15:49,910 --> 02:15:52,100
My mother! You do whatever you want.

2227
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:53,700
Don't ask me anything.

2228
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:55,700
What, you tiny?

2229
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,470
You aren't calling anyone daddy or grandpa or grandma now?

2230
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:01,240
From now, I won't call anyone that.

2231
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:02,580
He's my daddy from now on.

2232
02:16:03,030 --> 02:16:07,570
Bloody loyalty. If he's 420 [cheat], this boy is 840 [ bigger cheat].

2233
02:16:07,570 --> 02:16:09,250
He has not even seen anything.

2234
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:12,870
Yet he lies so much and blackmails people like this now.

2235
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:16,690
Once he grows up, he will swindle everyone.

2236
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:18,690
If we leave these 2 like this,

2237
02:16:18,690 --> 02:16:22,200
they'll build a palace out of their lies and throw dust in the eyes of people.

2238
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:23,650
That's why we shouldn't let them go.

2239
02:16:23,650 --> 02:16:27,990
We have to collect all the money we have sent until now.

2240
02:16:27,990 --> 02:16:33,030
Or show the money order counter foil and have them arrested by the police and put in jail.

2241
02:16:33,030 --> 02:16:39,590
Or their heads must be shaven and made to sit on a donkey and take a procession out to insult them.

2242
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:41,240
They don't have respect to lose it.

2243
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:44,800
There's no use giving small punishments to these people.

2244
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:47,680
If you ask me, we should kill them.

2245
02:16:47,680 --> 02:16:49,680
If I had brought my revolver,

2246
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:52,930
I would've shot him as soon as I got to know about his scheme.

2247
02:16:53,060 --> 02:16:55,220
Arey, I wouldn't have cared if I went to jail.

2248
02:16:55,220 --> 02:16:58,050
I would've been content that I killed a cheat.

2249
02:16:58,050 --> 02:17:01,120
If you had done that, I would've felt proud.

2250
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:03,380
He gave us these hopes,

2251
02:17:03,380 --> 02:17:05,380
and played with my emotions this rascal.

2252
02:17:05,570 --> 02:17:07,650
That day, when I read his letters,

2253
02:17:07,650 --> 02:17:09,650
I was so happy you know?

2254
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,210
Now that I know that all this is lie,

2255
02:17:12,210 --> 02:17:14,360
I feel like there's a fire in my belly.

2256
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:17,920
That fire won't leave him. It'll consume him.

2257
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:21,730
Is everybody done?

2258
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:25,590
No, it will be done once you're sent to jail.

2259
02:17:26,180 --> 02:17:27,490
Oh, it's like that.

2260
02:17:27,490 --> 02:17:29,490
Come, let's go to police station.

2261
02:17:29,490 --> 02:17:31,490
You give whatever complaint you want.

2262
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:33,620
Just because I'm sitting silent,

2263
02:17:33,620 --> 02:17:38,100
you're revolving around me like planets and saying whatever you feel like?

2264
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:39,940
What, Mr. Anand Rao?

2265
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:41,940
Am I the only one who has wronged?

2266
02:17:42,480 --> 02:17:47,940
I sent you a letter asking for money to raise your child. True.

2267
02:17:47,940 --> 02:17:51,940
What kind of an idiot do you have to be to believe that?

2268
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:58,840
Why did you believe that?

2269
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:00,840
Because of your weakness.

2270
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:02,840
Because you were not satisfied with your wife,

2271
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:06,630
you wanted to sleep with all the women in this world.

2272
02:18:06,930 --> 02:18:11,780
Because you thought all your female subordinates as prostitutes.

2273
02:18:12,070 --> 02:18:14,550
Poor Gowri was an orphan. Without anyone.

2274
02:18:14,550 --> 02:18:17,460
Using that weakness, you slept with her.

2275
02:18:17,640 --> 02:18:22,020
I, using this weakness in you, took money from you.

2276
02:18:22,230 --> 02:18:24,920
But what I've done is a big sin.

2277
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:28,710
And you're talking as if you've done some great deed.

2278
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:31,110
At least I did it for my hunger's sake.

2279
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:33,110
Why did you do it?

2280
02:18:33,110 --> 02:18:35,110
For joy?

2281
02:18:37,010 --> 02:18:41,380
Mr. Ananda Rao, why go only to police? We'll go to newspaper too.

2282
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:43,810
You tell them what I did to you.

2283
02:18:43,810 --> 02:18:46,760
I'll tell them why you believed me.

2284
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:50,360
Then people will decide, whose mistake is bigger.

2285
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:52,360
My god, I don't want anything with you.

2286
02:18:55,170 --> 02:18:56,800
What Mr. Madhu?

2287
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:58,800
Madhusudan the great.

2288
02:18:59,590 --> 02:19:01,800
What all did you say?

2289
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:03,590
You'll send me to police station?

2290
02:19:03,590 --> 02:19:06,820
You'll shave my head and take out a procession on a donkey?

2291
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:08,610
Oh, no.

2292
02:19:08,610 --> 02:19:10,020
Don't open my secret.

2293
02:19:10,020 --> 02:19:13,270
Why not? You were jumping until now.

2294
02:19:13,270 --> 02:19:15,270
Mr. Purnananda Rao.

2295
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:18,280
It is true that I blackmailed him saying Ganesha is his son.

2296
02:19:18,770 --> 02:19:24,340
But why did an unmarried guy like him give money to raise that child?

2297
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:25,520
There's the point.

2298
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:29,240
Lambodhar. Why talk about all that? Forget it.

2299
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:30,950
How can I forget it?

2300
02:19:31,170 --> 02:19:36,500
Shouldn't I tell Purnananda Rao and Vishalakshamma that you raped their daughter in law?

2301
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:38,500
What did you say?
Yes.

2302
02:19:38,530 --> 02:19:41,090
The boy whom you thought to be your grandson,

2303
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:45,940
Madhu believed him to be his son and was sending money every month. Why?

2304
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:50,640
That means, when your son Chandramouli got up in the middle of the reception,

2305
02:19:50,850 --> 02:19:52,870
and left to see you,

2306
02:19:53,010 --> 02:19:57,440
and when your daughter in law Gowri was sleeping alone in the wedding suite,

2307
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:00,560
your son's friend, this Madhusudan raped her.

2308
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:03,730
I came to know about it and spun a web.

2309
02:20:03,730 --> 02:20:05,030
He got caught in my web.

2310
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:06,100
You scoundrel.

2311
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,990
You raped my daughter in law?

2312
02:20:07,990 --> 02:20:11,250
You sinner. What had possessed you to do that? You must be...

2313
02:20:11,940 --> 02:20:13,040
And then you...

2314
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:17,920
you said your son got up in the middle of the reception and left.

2315
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:19,030
Why?

2316
02:20:19,030 --> 02:20:21,120
Who's behind it?
Lambodhara.

2317
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,280
Please stop it. Vishalakshi.

2318
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:27,700
If we stay here, he will divide us too. Shall we go?

2319
02:20:32,210 --> 02:20:33,970
What's all this?

2320
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:35,970
I don't understand your route.

2321
02:20:35,970 --> 02:20:37,640
Mrs. Sarsu Lambodhar.

2322
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:42,680
My route is to exploit and encash where there's weakness.

2323
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:46,310
Seeing the weakness in me, this Ganesha exploited me.

2324
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:47,780
This world is like that.

2325
02:20:47,780 --> 02:20:51,360
You too. As long as you have weaknesses in you,

2326
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:56,370
until then, there will be Lambodhars, people like me, who exploit them.

2327
02:20:56,370 --> 02:21:00,900
As long as there are people who can be cheated, there will be people who cheat.

2328
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:01,760
That's why...

2329
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:06,880
[If you have weaknesses in you, correct them. Otherwise beware of the Lambodhars.]

2330
