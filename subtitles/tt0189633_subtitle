1
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,212
Praise to the Goddess of Wealth!

2
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,540
Be generous Mother.
Be merciful Mother.

3
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:36,750
Peace to all.

4
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,909
Hail Mother Goddess.

5
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,969
Where is Birju?

6
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,272
The sun is up in the sky.

7
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,573
And his lordship still sleeps!

8
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:11,944
When I was his age, I'd leave home
at 6 in the morning with some clothes.

9
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,372
And I'd return by evening only
after selling and making some money.

10
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:19,080
Hail Mother Goddess.
Be merciful Mother.

11
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,810
Otherwise what would I eat
and how would I feed others?

12
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,911
To each his own fate.

13
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:29,483
You're right. When you can
eat for free Why must one slog?

14
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,304
He does Work hard.
Was studying till late night.

15
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,709
Studying? Must have been
snoring with the lights on!

16
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:41,179
I went to give him milk.
He was deeply engrossed in the book.

17
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,610
He didn't even know when I entered.

18
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:50,608
I've seen enough of his dramas
You mustn't make excuses for him!

19
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:53,009
Shall We leave father?
It's time to open the shop.

20
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:57,445
He too is your son.
Let's go, son.

21
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,111
Good morning grandpa.

22
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:08,407
I'll get you a sweetmeat
in the evening.

23
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,105
Will you get two if
I tell you something?

24
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:14,214
If ifs good news,
I'll have to bring it.

25
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,839
Do you know what uncle
was reading last night?

26
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,072
What was he reading?
This book.

27
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,941
So he was reading this?

28
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,743
A comic book.

29
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,411
Son, ifs bad manners to carry tales.

30
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,037
Should he seal his lips like you?

31
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,971
What sons I have! One who is
forever sleeping and the other...

32
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,773
Who sleeps even when awake!

33
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,241
Why are you screaming?

34
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,402
Thank God Pm only screaming,
not doing anything else!

35
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:48,572
You think he was studying last
night? See what he was studying!

36
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:52,642
Studying!
Drink milk before leaving.

37
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,747
Give it to the one who
has been studying all night!

38
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:59,037
Must be Weak studying so hard!
Why are you angry with milk?

39
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,644
Stop worrying about me.
And Worry about him!

40
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,074
Your son is getting out of hand.

41
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:40,913
Now are you pleased?
Don't make stories. Go.

42
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:46,206
Careful. It's slippery.
Yes, I know, mother.

43
00:12:54,733 --> 00:13:01,446
My question was if you've brought
some book or pen, We begin studies.

44
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,707
His four sneezes have
answered my four questions.

45
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,280
He has neither pen nor book nor
text nor the inclination to study!

46
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,346
That's his story. Now if others
Wish I'll teach something.

47
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:19,643
As it is this college has
neither benches nor classroom.

48
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,813
Don't look at me. Study!

49
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,211
What is it? This is the
sixth circular today!

50
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,344
Is this a college or a post office'?

51
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:32,771
New admission?

52
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,637
What's your name?

53
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,074
Was it you at the Wharf last evening?

54
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,341
It was you!

55
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,547
No, it was my twin sister.

56
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,143
Yes and she said a boy looked at her
yesterday and fell into the river.

57
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:37,507
Absolutely not! My foot slipped.

58
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,803
So it was you?

59
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,075
It's just 2 days since We came
here and you're up to your tricks!

60
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,811
Silly girl!

61
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,542
He almost believed me.

62
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,604
Fool!

63
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:03,871
Yes, mother?

64
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,439
Yes mother?
Nothing.

65
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,643
Something is nagging you. Tell me.

66
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:24,850
You know when you were very little
your Papa was martyred on the front.

67
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:31,315
And you also know how I've
worked in a school and raised you.

68
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,646
But you don't know one thing.
What is that?

69
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:44,004
Your twin sister...

70
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,847
I never told you this.

71
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:56,016
You were born and then
two minutes later, she came.

72
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,841
It was a dark stormy night.

73
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,449
So We named her...

74
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:07,076
Rhyming with yours. Neha and Meha.

75
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,644
â€œThere's she? Why didn't you tell me?

76
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:15,481
What are you saying? Tell me.

77
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,277
Mother !

78
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:28,040
Fooled you!
I don't like this.

79
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:31,737
The one fooling others got fooled!

80
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,805
Neha and Meha!

81
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,073
Not had enough with
falling in the river.

82
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:10,874
He's hidden his umbrella.

83
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,835
You've caught a cold.

84
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:18,115
Yes. If I soak for another
5 minutes, I'll die of pneumonia.

85
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:22,005
And only I can save you from death?

86
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:25,146
You are very understanding.

87
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,246
May I share your umbrella?
Sure.

88
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:50,438
Do you know my father, his Dad
and now I have this problem?

89
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:52,911
That is Why I keep sneezing!

90
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,272
Sneezing all the time?

91
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,909
At that point if somebody
asked me the address of heaven..

92
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,671
I would answer.

93
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:09,511
By the riverside,
under a red umbrella.

94
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,444
Tell me something...

95
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,871
Yes?
Why does this happen to me?

96
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,445
Because you're a fool.

97
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:45,975
Do you know Why Pm
sitting outside the temple?

98
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:48,670
I know.
Why?

99
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,910
To see me. What else?

100
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,713
Do you think Pm a fool?

101
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,575
To sit here to look at you?
Yes.

102
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,113
You think Wrong. Pm quite sensible.

103
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,979
And Pm more sensible than you!

104
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,237
How'?

105
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:10,280
Because even if you stop me
to talk, I won't stay back.

106
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,471
Go ahead. Pm not going to stop you.

107
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:16,941
That is Why you are a fool!

108
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,146
Where is Chandru?
There .

109
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:50,879
Who is that girl?
Where does she live?

110
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,714
Who? Neha?
You know her?

111
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:58,611
She stays behind the gurudwara.

112
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,781
She's very nice.
That's what has gone to her head!

113
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,243
She gives stupid answers!
You're very right.

114
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,306
Not only you, everybody says that.

115
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:12,372
Thinks no end of herself!
Know What she does if somebody drowns?

116
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,137
Laughs.
Absolutely right.

117
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,180
And if somebody is soaked to the
bone and dying of pneumonia...

118
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,676
What does she do?
Laughs even then.

119
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:22,745
Habit bound. But what is one
to do with this stubborn child?

120
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:26,844
Explain to her.
I am, for years.

121
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:30,476
Forget about her. Eat this.

122
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,210
Today is her birthday.

123
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,076
Neha' s mother .

124
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,607
Tell me Why does this
only happen with me?

125
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:53,677
People give such gifts on birthdays.

126
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,746
What did I give? Rebukes!

127
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,806
So now give her a gift.

128
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,108
Sir says one gift converts
failures into victories.

129
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,347
Is this my shirt you're wearing?

130
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,137
Yes.
I always help you?

131
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,435
Yes. Come with me.
But what do I have to do?

132
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,112
Pm getting scared!

133
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:28,180
No reason to be. Pm going
inside. Follow in 5 minutes.

134
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,506
What if Pm caught?
You won't be.

135
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:34,314
We're not stealing .
It's our shop. Don't be soared.

136
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,209
Dad, shall I keep this
money in the vault?

137
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:46,143
What money?
Gulabchand's 1000.

138
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,144
And Sharma's 1500.

139
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,840
One feels sorry if one
does not have children.

140
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:59,371
But if one has kids and they turn
out to be fools, he feels Worse!

141
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,944
Whom are you talking about?

142
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,876
There's nobody in this room
but for you and me.

143
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:09,241
You're my son. Pm your father.

144
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,809
Who is the fool?

145
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,511
In this World Where people
try to own others money.

146
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,842
You call a bundle of notes
bearing my name, somebody else's!

147
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,105
Good day father.

148
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:25,171
What are you doing here?

149
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:27,837
Early morning. . .at the shop?

150
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:29,907
What's Wrong with you?

151
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,172
A miracle took place!
Miracle?

152
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,779
It's really a miracle!

153
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,680
The riverside... strains of hymns..

154
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:43,777
And thousands of lamps...

155
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:49,075
And the glimpse of the goddess
in the radiance of the lamps!

156
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,203
Goddess?
Yes father.

157
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:53,679
It lifted the curtain on my eyes.

158
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:56,677
Now I see everything clearly.

159
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:00,438
Saris, scarves.

160
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,146
Suit pieces.

161
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,807
I'll sell father! From today
serving you is my religion!

162
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:10,573
I'll Work hard for you!

163
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,472
What are you doing?

164
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:28,681
I can see what you can't.

165
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,710
Come in sister.

166
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,143
Come right here sister.

167
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,277
Sister come in

168
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:52,775
I can't see you so
I don't know who you are.

169
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,947
I am Chandru.

170
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,774
Whether you're a daughter,
daughter-in-law, mother or granny.

171
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,874
Because I can't see her.

172
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:06,982
If you're a daughter you must buy..

173
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,537
If you're a daughter-in-law,
you must buy...

174
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,780
Silks with embroidery.

175
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:16,505
If you're a mother, you need...

176
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:19,344
Cottons.

177
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:23,140
I can't see you...

178
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,439
So I'll show her everything.

179
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,176
This really is a miracle!

180
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,344
Son, what is he doing?

181
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,343
Selling saris.

182
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,773
I can see that.

183
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,612
See this. Wonderful stuff.

184
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:42,207
You've come to buy one
but you'll end up with 3

185
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,373
Take this, and this...

186
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,047
And if you're a grandmother,
you must buy a suit piece.

187
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,611
Look at this.

188
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:00,409
Cut it.

189
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,573
You?

190
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:23,044
You, here?
Yes. Me, here.

191
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:28,846
Is this your shop?

192
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,071
You may consider it yours.

193
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:34,177
What shall I present?

194
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,540
Hot or cold?

195
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,308
Give me a scarf that
will match this dress.

196
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:43,806
First finish off with her.

197
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,643
Shes in no hurry.
I am!

198
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,109
Quiet. Have a look.

199
00:25:53,634 --> 00:25:56,410
You keep looking.
I'll keep showing.

200
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,108
What are you doing? I want just one.

201
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:05,279
If you take just one scarf,
the other scarves won't forgive me.

202
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,173
Cut my piece!
They look gorgeous on you.

203
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,313
Like a rainbow in an
open sky after a downpour.

204
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,704
Are you a poet?
Cut it please!

205
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,073
Cut it!

206
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:33,048
To sell scarves a good salesman
will Write an epic not just poems!

207
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,774
Son, he turned out to be
a marvellous salesman, isn't it?

208
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,704
Look at this yellow.

209
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:50,242
Very pretty.
Keep it.

210
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:56,607
If you wear it, it will appear as
if the sun has kissed the earth.

211
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,044
Forget it. I don't have so much cash

212
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:04,413
It's a gift for you on your birthday.

213
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,774
Cut it please!

214
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:16,508
It's tradition with our shop.
A first time customer keeps coming.

215
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:19,245
He keeps coming father!

216
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,247
Son, this is salesmanship.

217
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,547
Learn from him.
That's what Pm doing.

218
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,980
Will you sit and learn? Why don't
you attend to the other customer?

219
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,437
But I don't want yellow. I want
a blue one to go with this dress.

220
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:44,505
When I first saw you, do you
know the color of your dress?

221
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,112
What was it?
Yellow.

222
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:50,280
Your relation to the
color yellow is...

223
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:52,573
Like a pearl and an oyster.

224
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,573
The morning and dew.

225
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,548
Like sneeze and Water,
rain and umbrella!

226
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,602
Listen sister, you come there.

227
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,137
BIO!
NO Way!

228
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:09,210
What are you doing?
This is my first customer.

229
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:12,743
If he gets out of my hand,
it will be inauspicious. Dad?

230
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,002
It will be inauspicious father!

231
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,246
Call him father.

232
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:21,737
Brother go there.

233
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,872
Son...

234
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,207
What are you staring at? Come here!

235
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:38,207
Listen...

236
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,309
Yes?
Come closer.

237
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,207
Yes?
Closer.

238
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:53,043
Your first customer...

239
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,041
It's not a customer.
Really?

240
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:05,550
She's got your pink piece
hidden in her dress.

241
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,373
Who is it?

242
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:11,343
It's a thief.

243
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,237
Catch him.

244
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,571
Catch him.
Catch?

245
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,175
Son are you watching?
Pm learning father.

246
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,646
Fast!

247
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:35,043
Go away from me!

248
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,773
There maybe a gun under
the dress. You go there.

249
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:43,713
Cut it!

250
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,741
Run away!

251
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,907
Who is it?

252
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,646
What have you done?

253
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,106
What have I done?
What?

254
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:07,111
I said I Wouldn't wear this dress!

255
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,813
You did?
And you said...

256
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,909
I have to steal saris.
I said that?

257
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:15,812
Yes.

258
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,212
Yes I said so!
Remember what else I said?

259
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,377
Yes, on the birthday...
Quiet!

260
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:27,776
I'll tell father. You listen to me.

261
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,379
Come here. You think I'd steal?

262
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:35,208
Didn't you? Is it a crime
to give a gift on a birthday?

263
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,469
Birthday? Whose?

264
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:40,211
What date is it today?

265
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:43,707
- 12th of August.

266
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,474
Whose birthday falls on this day?

267
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:49,236
Whose?
Not yours.

268
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,476
Nor mine, nor brothers or Pappu's.

269
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,511
And sister-in-law's is Way off.

270
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:56,079
Who remains?

271
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:59,443
Your mother?
Yes!

272
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,705
Your mother's birthday?
You forgot again!

273
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:05,678
I forgot last year too.

274
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:11,273
Son, get the fresh stock of saris out.

275
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,312
Why are you laughing?

276
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:34,570
What's the matter?

277
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:40,138
Then I saw his shoes.
Whose?

278
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,079
Chandru' s .

279
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,573
From the gurudwara?

280
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,213
You've been laughing continuously
People will think you're mad.

281
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:53,106
All the Way home.
You too are laughing.

282
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,508
That's at something else.

283
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:38,040
Acted foolishly again.
What must she think of me?

284
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:41,612
As you sow so shall you reap.

285
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,441
When you've sowed gum,
you can't reap mangoes.

286
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:49,508
You keep preaching all the while.
Why didn't you stop me then?

287
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,876
You didn't give me a chance.
Caught me and took me there!

288
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,709
Made me wear the dress.
What could I have done?

289
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,914
Everything has been ruined.
Now how will I ever face her!

290
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,477
My sir also says...

291
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:06,212
If you repent and apologise
with a true heart...

292
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:09,812
The clothes were ours, father
is mine and I apologise to her?

293
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,603
No Way! But sir...
I said no Way!

294
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,978
So Why are you upset?

295
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:23,047
I have nobody.
No parents, no siblings.

296
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,476
He does so much for me.
I too should repay him.

297
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:31,739
He is very nice and
he likes you very much.

298
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,506
That is Why he stole the saris.

299
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,945
He's here. Don't take him in!

300
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:42,309
Don't move from here.

301
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,545
You? Here too?

302
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:56,414
Here too. I came to ask if it is
a sin to fulfill a poor man's dream.

303
00:33:56,867 --> 00:34:01,043
Absolutely not.
Chandru is very poor.

304
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,075
His father passed away
in his childhood.

305
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:11,306
He Wanted to give his
sister a sari for Rakhi.

306
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:12,970
To his sister?

307
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:17,204
Please come in.

308
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,175
Actually my father is very nice.

309
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,347
He gives anything if We ask for it.

310
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,413
So you thought you'd steal saris
from your own shop for a poor guy.

311
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,371
What? Learned men say..

312
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:37,004
A theft which does not harm or
hurt anybody is not a theft.

313
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:38,969
But 3 saris?

314
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:41,272
The other was for his mother.

315
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:45,237
And the third...
For his sister-in-law!

316
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,911
You are truly Wise.

317
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:53,613
But even I didn't
understand the dress piece.

318
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,247
I'll explain. That was
for his grandmother.

319
00:34:57,434 --> 00:35:00,244
I see.
She doesn't wear saris.

320
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,140
You are great.

321
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,942
In today's selfish World
who thinks about others?

322
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,938
One must think.

323
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,613
The saint Kabir has said,
in this World of sorrows...

324
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:14,010
Will you have some Water?

325
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:18,477
Just one glass for me.
The other is for that poor guy.

326
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,280
Who has nobody in this World.

327
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,439
No brother or sister.

328
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,242
She knows everything.

329
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,677
I have nobody but you.
I told her everything.

330
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:42,547
Nice of you to tell her.

331
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:45,979
Very nice.

332
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:56,412
Why does this happen only to me?

333
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,910
Matter of stars.
When's your birthday?

334
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,540
When is it?

335
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:10,414
What is it?
Did you think I'd forget again?

336
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:12,442
Are you crazy?

337
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:16,743
Out of 365 days let me
be crazy for one day.

338
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,913
Pm not just Wishing you.

339
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:22,876
See what I've brought.

340
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,913
For Whom is this?
For the birthday girl.

341
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,639
Who is that?
Definitely not me.

342
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:36,476
Neither is it Ram Kumar's
or Brij Kumar's.

343
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,878
Then Whose birthday is it?

344
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,310
Mother! You've become
as forgetful as father!

345
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,371
What are you doing?

346
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:56,477
Say it's your birthday or
I'll get thrashed soundly!

347
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,778
You remembered my birthday?

348
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,005
You're so nice!

349
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,137
You?
Yes.

350
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,775
I'll post it for you.

351
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,340
I couldn't give you a gift
on your birthday yesterday.

352
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:44,438
Where did you steal this from?

353
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:48,471
I borrowed it from the rose plant.

354
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:52,140
The other ï¬‚owers won't
forgive you for this.

355
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,913
Let them not. But I Wanted it.

356
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,442
The most beautiful ï¬‚ower.

357
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,004
The prettiest. The most delicate.

358
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,040
Like you.

359
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,845
Spreading fragrance Wherever it goes.

360
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,271
Listen...

361
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:20,674
Yes?
Why does this happen to me?

362
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,740
I took 2 hours to choose the
ï¬‚ower and then I posted it!

363
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:28,448
I fall into the Water
when I first see you.

364
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,045
Why doesn't this happen to you?

365
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:34,173
You fall in the Water and I laugh.

366
00:38:34,434 --> 00:38:37,472
You're getting drenched in the
rain and I have the umbrella.

367
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,608
I run away from you
and you come close.

368
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:42,940
I must come close?

369
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,609
This close?

370
00:40:58,267 --> 00:41:01,043
Look at this shade of yellow

371
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,811
I won't repeat yesterdays mistake.

372
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:34,743
The letter and ï¬‚ower
are both in your hands.

373
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,710
My letter will say what the
ï¬‚ower couldn't say yesterday.

374
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:42,871
I like you very much.

375
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,846
If you keep the ï¬‚ower,
I'll assume you too like...

376
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:49,742
Who gave this?

377
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:35,717
Mister Birju, glad to
know you like me so much.

378
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:41,447
But I only like those
who do not steal.

379
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:45,576
And are brave enough
to accept their faults.

380
00:45:45,734 --> 00:45:49,204
In front of everyone.
This you cannot do.

381
00:45:49,434 --> 00:45:52,972
So you keep this ï¬‚ower.

382
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,710
Take this son.

383
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,211
Sukhram's money?

384
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:27,913
Said the Wrong thing! The note
reads my name and the money is his?

385
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:33,312
How often have I told you the
moment I put this chit, it's mine!

386
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:35,673
Grandpa, uncle.

387
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:38,239
Good morning father.

388
00:46:38,334 --> 00:46:41,474
Where are you off so early?

389
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:43,545
It's time for the prayers.

390
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,045
Since when have you started
attending prayer meetings?

391
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:50,681
Since I accompanied mother to
the temple, my life has changed.

392
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:54,143
Let me know what miracle took place.

393
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,180
I told you I'd seen the
goddess at the riverside.

394
00:46:58,334 --> 00:47:00,746
I was transformed.

395
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,373
In that light...

396
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:06,777
Look son. Listen to meâ€œ

397
00:47:07,134 --> 00:47:09,546
There's no need for you to
be so religious at this age.

398
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:12,111
It's needed only at this age.

399
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:17,641
He's gone for prayers.
Yes. That's good.

400
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:22,316
â€œThat's good? He's always
up to some mischief.

401
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:24,478
If he goes for prayers,
he'll turn into a saint!

402
00:47:24,567 --> 00:47:26,547
I say get him married.

403
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,113
Marriage?
Didn't you get married?

404
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:57,574
Excuse me sir.
I Wish to say something.

405
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,643
This boy Wants to say something.
He's asking for your permission.

406
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:09,837
Come and sit here.

407
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,141
Here. Speak up.

408
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:16,977
I've made many mistakes in life.

409
00:48:17,134 --> 00:48:19,842
But I never apologized for it.

410
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,677
But now somebody has taken me
out of the darkness of ignorance.

411
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,977
I was told a good man is one...

412
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,207
...Who has the courage to bravely
and honestly own them up in public.

413
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,371
Today whatever mistakes I have
blindly committed in love...

414
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:43,041
No need for details. You've come
to God. He forgives you everything.

415
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:46,210
God has forgiven me.

416
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:50,282
But now I want to go and
apologise to that person...

417
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:53,141
...Who has shown me
the light of knowledge.

418
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:54,508
Fine.

419
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,743
I'll be there at 8 tomorrow morning.

420
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,542
Mother! Where are you going?
Please don't go!

421
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,237
Pm going to school like everyday.

422
00:49:41,334 --> 00:49:44,315
Mother, no...
Out with it quickly.

423
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,580
What do I tell him?

424
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:50,304
What you've been trying
to say since last night.

425
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:54,507
Okay. Come and sit here.

426
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,173
What am I?
My mother.

427
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:03,747
I can read everything on your face.

428
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,540
When my child is happy or sad...

429
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:09,907
But today she's very confused.

430
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:13,778
I am confused. If he
really comes, What do I say?

431
00:50:13,934 --> 00:50:18,041
You have to decide what you must say.

432
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:22,981
My mother too gave me this right.

433
00:50:26,467 --> 00:50:28,037
Recognise this?

434
00:50:28,134 --> 00:50:32,947
When you were little, you always
snatched it from Papa's finger.

435
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,274
And he'd laugh and say,
I'll give il: to you...

436
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:41,346
For the man you choose.

437
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:48,548
Now ifs your turn. You must decide.

438
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:52,341
Only tell me when it is to be given.

439
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,280
Now Pm off. It's getting late.

440
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:01,469
Tell you something?

441
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:04,011
Even I like that boy.

442
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:06,372
Only he's a little foolish.

443
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,345
It's 8 o'clock.

444
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:15,680
I said I'd come at 8.

445
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:19,112
So I've come.
That's nice. Now go.

446
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:23,940
In your letter you said you'd
forgive me if I publicly apologized.

447
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,670
I've forgiven you. Don't come down.

448
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:28,074
Forgiven me?
Yes.

449
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:30,745
That's all?
What else?

450
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:33,613
Do me another favour.

451
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:36,040
What do I do?

452
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,072
Only the fortunate are
blessed with such kids.

453
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:29,909
Yes. We keep
explaining to him.

454
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:32,240
Son, these are your days of enjoyment

455
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,938
But he has only one thing in mind
Work and more Work.

456
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:39,376
These days he even
attends prayer meetings.

457
00:57:39,567 --> 00:57:42,013
Have a drink.
Thank you.

458
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:46,244
He Works so hard...

459
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:49,347
He's a diamond.

460
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:54,741
If your son is a diamond,
my grand daughter is a pearl!

461
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,871
Here is the customary token.

462
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,881
Sir you. . .
We'll accept il: if our son agrees.

463
00:58:01,467 --> 00:58:05,472
This is just a token. The real
token will be on the engagement.

464
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,410
Now don't refuse us.

465
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,174
You're requesting us
and We won't accept?

466
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:13,643
Okay I'll Write a chit of my name.

467
00:58:14,434 --> 00:58:16,380
Give me one, son.

468
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,977
Money is always like this.

469
00:58:21,133 --> 00:58:25,172
This belonged to you. The moment
I put my name on it, ifs mine.

470
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,243
What can I tell you about my elder
son's wife. They gave so much that..

471
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,346
I had to buy a new vault.

472
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:39,243
I don't want to blow
my own trumpet but...

473
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:44,042
Forget about buying
vaults, buy a house nearby.

474
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,779
She's your grand daughter.
Give her as much as you please.

475
00:58:50,267 --> 00:58:54,443
My daughter will be behind
and your son ahead of her...

476
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,945
Son.
Yes father?

477
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,708
Come and sit here.

478
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,511
Come and sit.

479
00:59:06,267 --> 00:59:10,181
Eat some famous sweetmeats of Simla

480
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,211
Have some grams of our place.

481
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:17,848
He's brought a proposal for you
from his grand daughter.

482
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:21,110
I'll fulfill all your desires.

483
00:59:21,134 --> 00:59:24,411
Colour television, motor car.

484
00:59:25,867 --> 00:59:27,574
Feeling shy in my presence.

485
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:31,271
Doesn't matter. Tell Dad
whatever you want from me.

486
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,111
So this is what you Want?

487
00:59:41,734 --> 00:59:45,204
Rascal! Fall in love and
ruin our family reputation!

488
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:47,905
It's not a sin to fall in love.

489
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,046
No shame to talk of love
in his father's presence!

490
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,081
Has there ever been a love
marriage in our family?

491
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,937
There'd be a love marriage
if somebody had fallen in love.

492
00:59:57,067 --> 00:59:58,876
This is what you teach him!

493
00:59:59,034 --> 01:00:04,177
What do both of you think?
Will I give up my dowry for you?

494
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,941
But father Neha's mother...

495
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:09,773
What does that teacher have?
Her mother...

496
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:12,871
What are you bleating on about?

497
01:00:14,134 --> 01:00:16,842
Father her mother's brother!

498
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,640
Her maternal uncle.

499
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,436
<i>Mother's brother.</i>

500
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,380
I know. So he'll give her dowry

501
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,313
Yes father.
Fool somebody else.

502
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:31,346
Poor mother and her
brother is king of Spain!

503
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,346
He is a king but
of Bombay not Spain.

504
01:00:35,567 --> 01:00:37,513
This man is nothing in comparison.

505
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,137
She's his only grand daughter.

506
01:00:40,267 --> 01:00:42,770
Neha too is the only
niece of her uncle.

507
01:00:42,967 --> 01:00:45,038
All his property is hers.

508
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,777
So call him over.

509
01:00:48,934 --> 01:00:51,107
Let's see how powerful he is.

510
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,872
Press my feet!

511
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,676
Uncle!

512
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,711
I can't become the uncle.

513
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:07,746
Pm too short to be a Wealthy uncle.

514
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,811
And voice too childish.
Shut up!

515
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:13,915
Do you have millions?
Nobody in this place has!

516
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:19,082
My grandpa has 3 vaults full.

517
01:01:22,634 --> 01:01:24,614
Will you get me a glass of Water?

518
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:26,474
Will you get me a sweetmeat?

519
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,275
I'll get you two.

520
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,206
No! I won't do it!

521
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,277
Neha's uncle has sent it.

522
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:51,037
So much money?

523
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:54,908
For uncle ifs just a little.

524
01:02:55,467 --> 01:02:59,074
But he should have come personally

525
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,138
I Wanted to meet him.

526
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,908
I said the same but the messenger
said the letter explains all.

527
01:03:08,933 --> 01:03:10,207
Respected sir.

528
01:03:10,433 --> 01:03:17,578
As Neha's uncle it was my duty to
lay this humble amount at your feet.

529
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:24,540
But my sister thinks otherwise.
Both of them are reforming society.

530
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:27,170
They detest the Word dowry!

531
01:03:27,334 --> 01:03:30,679
But Pm a businessman like you.

532
01:03:31,267 --> 01:03:34,214
I respect your sentiments.

533
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,680
I'll continue to do so
in the future.

534
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:40,308
Neha is like my daughter.

535
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,104
All that I possess is hers.

536
01:03:44,834 --> 01:03:51,752
I only request you not to tell
my sister about this secret deal.

537
01:03:52,334 --> 01:03:56,942
Even if the wedding breaks off,
she will never accept this money.

538
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:03,675
Do send the couple to Bombay
after they are married.

539
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:08,113
Respectfully yours,
Neha's uncle.

540
01:04:09,267 --> 01:04:12,043
Send you over?
He's invited us.

541
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,402
It's all free. Lodging,
boarding, clothing...

542
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:16,604
He's got cloth mills in Bombay.

543
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,940
Now our clothes will come
directly from Bombay.

544
01:04:20,134 --> 01:04:23,138
Directly from Bombay?

545
01:04:25,134 --> 01:04:28,274
Should I call Neha's mother?
No!

546
01:04:28,434 --> 01:04:31,381
No son. It doesn't seem right.

547
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:34,204
There's no male in her house.

548
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:37,207
So We'll go over.

549
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:03,771
Stop this drama!

550
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,876
Where did you get the money from?

551
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,603
I stole it.
Stole again?

552
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:14,012
I gave father's money to him.
That's not stealing.

553
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:17,743
Mother, the money did
not go out of the house.

554
01:05:17,867 --> 01:05:22,316
The notes only went from the
outside vault to the one inside.

555
01:05:24,034 --> 01:05:25,809
Pm not doing this for myself.

556
01:05:26,034 --> 01:05:29,641
You want a cute daughter-in-law.
Now the wedding will be smooth.

557
01:05:30,067 --> 01:05:32,240
We'll go to uncle in Bombay.

558
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:35,371
And tell father everything.
He'll be a little angry.

559
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:39,174
Scold us a little.
Then he'll forgive us.

560
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,305
Son...

561
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,677
Pm going to the
temple with my parents.

562
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:10,007
Then they will come to your house.

563
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,875
Do you know Why?
To ask for your hand.

564
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,306
<i>Do serve them sweetmeats.</i>

565
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:32,475
Live long child.
Be happy.

566
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:43,214
I think We should send the kids
to Bombay for their honeymoon.

567
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,304
The Whole World goes
to hill stations

568
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:48,674
But it would be best
if they went to Bombay.

569
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:52,974
It's a great city.
By the Way you may have visited it...

570
01:06:56,367 --> 01:06:58,210
I went there years ago.

571
01:06:59,634 --> 01:07:05,676
It's best to forget old matters.

572
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:09,913
It's your own relations
who help in times of need.

573
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:12,913
You must be having relatives there?

574
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,538
Those who have nobody have God.

575
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,040
My daughter is truly lucky.

576
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,237
All of you have come to
ask for her so lovingly.

577
01:07:25,334 --> 01:07:28,076
There was no dearth of
proposals for our son.

578
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:33,206
Line outside our house.
And everyone Wanted to give dowry.

579
01:07:35,334 --> 01:07:39,874
But I have nothing except my daughter

580
01:07:40,734 --> 01:07:45,376
We Wouldn't have taken anything
even if you had! Isn't it?

581
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:49,107
The one who gives a
daughter gives everything.

582
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,773
It's love that's exchanged.

583
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:56,416
I believe whatever a man is...

584
01:07:56,734 --> 01:07:59,510
The giver is somebody else.

585
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:03,838
Who knows who he is.
And what he can give.

586
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:08,077
You just decide on the wedding date.

587
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:13,010
Have a sweet.

588
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:16,407
Here child.

589
01:08:25,733 --> 01:08:27,872
They are delicious.

590
01:08:33,267 --> 01:08:38,979
Shall I go?
No.

591
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,580
Will you let me go if
I give you something? What?

592
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:49,704
Come close.
Close?

593
01:08:57,234 --> 01:08:59,077
It was my Papaâ€™s.

594
01:09:00,067 --> 01:09:04,607
It contains my love and
my mother's blessings.

595
01:09:08,567 --> 01:09:10,808
Never take it off.

596
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:14,474
I Won't. Never.

597
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:17,772
Even I want to give you something.

598
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:20,480
I think I'll give it now.

599
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:25,245
Don't turn it down.

600
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:31,269
Grams!

601
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:06,009
What's Wrong? Can't sleep?

602
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:10,413
Just like that.

603
01:10:12,434 --> 01:10:15,176
I was so Worried about your marriage.

604
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:20,281
And now when we've found such
a sweet boy and good family...

605
01:10:20,867 --> 01:10:22,676
I am frightened.

606
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:25,008
How will everything be organized?

607
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,773
How will I stay Without you?

608
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:34,708
Why do you talk like this?

609
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:38,674
Pm not going far.
I'll come everyday.

610
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:40,941
To be fed by you.

611
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:43,013
To make you oil my hair.

612
01:10:43,367 --> 01:10:46,280
And if you talk so, I won't go.

613
01:10:46,467 --> 01:10:50,381
Silly girl! You have to go.

614
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:53,346
Everyone has to go.

615
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:55,708
This is the tradition.

616
01:10:56,501 --> 01:11:01,007
And this fright will
vanish in a couple of days.

617
01:11:01,734 --> 01:11:05,147
Once you are Wed happily...

618
01:11:05,867 --> 01:11:08,370
Then I'll sleep tight.

619
01:11:09,334 --> 01:11:12,247
I'll fall into a deep sleep.

620
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:16,575
The mother Whose daughter
is happy...

621
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:19,140
Her life is happy.

622
01:14:25,134 --> 01:14:28,775
Got taken in by the teacher
and fooled your father! Stole!

623
01:16:34,834 --> 01:16:37,644
The groom won't come!

624
01:16:51,067 --> 01:16:54,640
Let her rest. Come with me.
It's a mild attack.

625
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,904
You have to admit her. I'll
Write a note. Take her to Simla.

626
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,741
We'll take her.
Not We, I'll take her!

627
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:04,540
Don't talk like this.

628
01:17:04,701 --> 01:17:07,477
Should I dance and sing? Or laugh?

629
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,244
I had no idea this little joke...

630
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:14,143
Everything is a joke for you.
Pm a joke! My mother is a joke!

631
01:17:14,334 --> 01:17:17,042
And this 1:00 is a joke that
people will think I'm a thief!

632
01:17:17,267 --> 01:17:19,747
My mother is a thief
We made you steal!

633
01:17:20,034 --> 01:17:23,811
You swore before God
never to tell lies.

634
01:17:23,934 --> 01:17:26,505
You won't steal.
But what did you do?

635
01:17:26,701 --> 01:17:30,444
The same! Because that's
all that you can do!

636
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,975
Since Pm responsible,
I'll fix everything.

637
01:17:35,334 --> 01:17:38,872
What will you do?
Go home and stretch your hands?

638
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:43,675
Beg? And get my mother
treated with that money?

639
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:46,906
No Neha.
Then how?

640
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:51,380
Then how? Tell me, how?

641
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,913
How will you treat my mother?

642
01:17:54,867 --> 01:17:56,608
Tell me, how!

643
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,770
Don't come in. For my sake!

644
01:18:51,434 --> 01:18:54,677
I'll come with you.
Haven't you done enough?

645
01:18:54,834 --> 01:18:57,280
Do you want to kill my mother?

646
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,739
If something happens to my mother,
I'll never forgive you!

647
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:04,370
Nothing will happen to her.
I'll look after her.

648
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:07,475
I swear...
Yes, promise me...

649
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:09,977
Never show me your face!

650
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:14,479
I Won't, till I get her treated.
But don't leave like this!

651
01:21:05,267 --> 01:21:06,712
Listen... excuse me.

652
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:12,077
My mother is unwell.
Please hurry up.

653
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:14,706
Fill this form.

654
01:21:17,234 --> 01:21:19,407
Write your name, address properly.

655
01:21:19,567 --> 01:21:22,514
If there's any mistake,
they'll say I was sleeping.

656
01:21:23,301 --> 01:21:25,008
Was I sleeping?

657
01:21:25,934 --> 01:21:28,437
General Ward or special room?

658
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:32,309
Pay 5000 bucks for
special room over there.

659
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:36,915
I don't have that much.
Then Why did you spoil my form?

660
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,637
I've already been Warned earlier.

661
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:42,747
I've come from far...
Everybody does.

662
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,311
My mother is very unwell.
I too have a mother who is sick.

663
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:47,773
But what can one do?

664
01:21:48,134 --> 01:21:51,638
Do something?
What? Admit her Without payment?

665
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:54,743
I'll lose my job sister.

666
01:21:55,467 --> 01:21:57,105
The key.
Yes, doctor.

667
01:21:58,434 --> 01:22:00,311
Doctor! Sir!

668
01:22:01,134 --> 01:22:03,239
What are you doing?
For God's sake...

669
01:22:03,367 --> 01:22:05,870
Stop this crying!
I say just shut up!

670
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:19,109
Were you going to run all
the Way to Simla? 328 kilometers?

671
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:21,371
Why are you fooling us?

672
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,546
He was running like a madman.

673
01:22:24,734 --> 01:22:27,613
Had you not stopped
he'd have fainted.

674
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,440
What happened to you was Wrong.

675
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:33,108
But what will you go there and do?

676
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:36,610
You've sworn not to
show the girl your face.

677
01:22:37,267 --> 01:22:40,214
I have sworn so I Won't.

678
01:22:40,834 --> 01:22:42,370
I won't break my promise!

679
01:22:42,534 --> 01:22:48,678
But I didn't promise not to see her.

680
01:22:48,934 --> 01:22:52,177
I'll see her, every moment.

681
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:55,010
Even if ifs from far.

682
01:22:55,201 --> 01:22:58,614
Wow! This is romance!

683
01:22:59,067 --> 01:23:01,104
Learn from him.

684
01:23:01,934 --> 01:23:05,472
No! I'll learn to drive from you.

685
01:23:05,534 --> 01:23:07,912
You're stupid!

686
01:23:29,034 --> 01:23:32,072
No problem. That's Mall Road.

687
01:23:32,234 --> 01:23:33,975
The hospital is there.

688
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:38,680
Come to me if you ever need help.

689
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,937
Learn something.
No sir.

690
01:23:50,134 --> 01:23:51,943
I have to go to Riwasa.

691
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:54,478
After you get Well.

692
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:57,079
I'll plead with Birju's father...

693
01:23:57,234 --> 01:24:02,809
I'll tell him that...
You won't do that.

694
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:07,843
They will never agree.

695
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,438
We'll watch for a few days.
If she suffers another attack...

696
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:15,104
We'll give her blood transfusion.

697
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:19,437
I want a report every 30 minutes.

698
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,337
Sorry I yelled at you.

699
01:24:26,534 --> 01:24:28,172
I'd just returned from ICU.

700
01:24:28,334 --> 01:24:31,611
An 8 year old girl held
my hand and asked...

701
01:24:31,767 --> 01:24:34,680
What's Wrong with me uncle?
A small kid.

702
01:24:35,367 --> 01:24:39,281
Whom I had seen laughing,
playing, eating chocolates.

703
01:24:39,434 --> 01:24:42,108
She was asking me the truth

704
01:24:42,934 --> 01:24:44,880
I promise I won't cry.

705
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,337
And I told her the truth.

706
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,308
After 15 minutes, Without crying...

707
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,640
Nor shedding tears, she died.

708
01:24:59,967 --> 01:25:04,177
That is Why when I came out and
saw you cry, I couldn't myself.

709
01:25:25,001 --> 01:25:27,481
Has any patient come
here from Riwasa?

710
01:25:27,767 --> 01:25:28,939
Inquire there.

711
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,909
I want to find out Whether
any patient came from Riwasa.

712
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:37,809
Room no 9, third room
on the left. Upstairs.

713
01:25:38,001 --> 01:25:39,810
Nobody will stop you now. Go.

714
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:43,742
Please find out for me.
Why should I?

715
01:25:44,034 --> 01:25:45,445
You go yourself.

716
01:25:46,834 --> 01:25:50,008
Should I leave my duty and go?
Tell me one thing...

717
01:25:50,334 --> 01:25:54,840
Is it a custom in Riwasa to
get people thrown out of jobs?

718
01:25:57,601 --> 01:25:59,012
What's the matter?

719
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:00,873
Tell me.

720
01:28:43,934 --> 01:28:47,313
Diwanji has come!
How is it possible?

721
01:28:47,634 --> 01:28:50,706
He has come and you didn't get up!

722
01:28:50,967 --> 01:28:55,245
What will he think? Dad!

723
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,205
Your dream has come true Dad!

724
01:29:09,334 --> 01:29:11,814
He's so young!
In my dreams he was old.

725
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:20,246
I just dreamt of you.
You came to my laundry.

726
01:29:20,301 --> 01:29:26,183
And bought the Whole collection at
a price Where I could see London!

727
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,178
Come. I'll show you the collection.

728
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,237
My name is Bhigelal.

729
01:29:38,767 --> 01:29:41,475
I always got Wet in my childhood.

730
01:29:41,634 --> 01:29:45,343
So my Dad named me Bhigelal.

731
01:29:46,634 --> 01:29:50,241
My Dad's name was Sukhelal.
He worked in the laundry.

732
01:29:50,767 --> 01:29:52,804
The English frequented this place.

733
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:58,347
This is London Laundry.
Please come in sir.

734
01:29:59,067 --> 01:30:02,810

you like, hot or cold?

Have a Wash.

736
01:30:07,767 --> 01:30:11,544
I've reached London looking at you.

737
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,976
Please sit, sir.
I'll get the collection.

738
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,305
I'll be back in a minute sir.

739
01:30:35,967 --> 01:30:37,878
Where are you?

740
01:30:38,334 --> 01:30:41,213
Does anybody leave home like this?

741
01:30:41,834 --> 01:30:44,781
Nobody has slept all night.

742
01:30:44,934 --> 01:30:47,039
Is this right?

743
01:30:47,834 --> 01:30:49,905
Don't worry. Pm fine Where I am.

744
01:30:50,067 --> 01:30:53,378
How is Neha's mother? Is she fine?

745
01:30:53,534 --> 01:30:55,070
Do you need money?

746
01:30:55,267 --> 01:30:57,645
Should We come there?
No mother!

747
01:30:58,067 --> 01:31:00,104
If you come here, I'll kill myself

748
01:31:00,334 --> 01:31:03,474
Where are you son?
Rascal has called up?

749
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,746
Needs money?

750
01:31:06,101 --> 01:31:08,547
How much money does he want
and Where is it to be sent?

751
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,079
Tell father I'll die
but not touch his money!

752
01:31:19,234 --> 01:31:23,876
He says he'll die but
not touch father's money.

753
01:31:37,001 --> 01:31:39,447
You...are not Diwanji?

754
01:31:41,834 --> 01:31:43,211
Youâ€™re joking!

755
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:49,480
You've come from Chamba.
To buy my Dad's collection.

756
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:57,642
Then Why? Why did you wear such
clothes and break my dreams?

757
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:03,445
Who are you?

758
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,109
Pm from Riwasa.

759
01:32:08,267 --> 01:32:11,441
I've left my home.
So fine!

760
01:32:11,767 --> 01:32:16,011
You made a long distance call?

761
01:32:17,234 --> 01:32:20,181
Give me 50 rupees! Come on!

762
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:23,813
I don't have any money.
No money?

763
01:32:24,734 --> 01:32:26,008
No money?

764
01:32:27,067 --> 01:32:30,378
I'll claim that money! Think how!

765
01:32:35,234 --> 01:32:37,305
The question that arises is Why?

766
01:32:37,534 --> 01:32:39,878
Are you ironing clothes
or sawing Wood?

767
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:45,248
Pm collecting money to go to London

768
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:48,670
Yet Pm employing you
as an extra servant.

769
01:32:49,634 --> 01:32:51,910
The question is Why?

770
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,073
You look like an Englishman.

771
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:02,869
An English servant!

772
01:33:05,134 --> 01:33:08,513
Despite the ï¬‚attery don't be under
the impression, I'll pay you extra.

773
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:11,044
Just 50 paise per cloth.

774
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:17,543
Sir even if you give me 25
I Won't leave your shop and go.

775
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,276
Now don't ask Why.

776
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:32,237
Don't burn the cloth!

777
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:43,340
Health?

778
01:33:44,634 --> 01:33:48,548
She got up in the morning
and had a headache...

779
01:33:48,734 --> 01:33:51,442
The nurse gave her a shot and...

780
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:55,310
I get your mother's
reports everyday.

781
01:33:55,567 --> 01:33:57,979
This is Monday, that Tuesday.

782
01:33:58,034 --> 01:34:00,378
This Wednesday, herds Thursday.

783
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:04,004
I was inquiring about you.

784
01:34:04,767 --> 01:34:07,407
Your mother said you
smiled a lot in Riwasa.

785
01:34:07,567 --> 01:34:09,376
When did she tell you?

786
01:34:09,534 --> 01:34:11,878
We always talk about you.

787
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:15,577
She was telling me all about you.

788
01:34:15,667 --> 01:34:17,840
How you love troubling others.

789
01:34:17,901 --> 01:34:19,380
You love mischief.

790
01:34:19,467 --> 01:34:21,174
And ï¬‚owers.

791
01:34:22,367 --> 01:34:26,281
Half your mother's treatment
will be treated with my medicines.

792
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:30,038
And the rest will be by your smile.

793
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,040
This red ï¬‚ower thrice a day
with cold Water for your smile.

794
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,142
Must be around here somewhere.

795
01:34:44,034 --> 01:34:45,570
Mother what are you looking for?

796
01:34:45,667 --> 01:34:47,010
Medicines.

797
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:51,780
Not medicines. I know
what you're looking for.

798
01:34:53,234 --> 01:34:54,577
This?
Yes, this.

799
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:57,078
Shall I post it?
Why don't you go?

800
01:34:57,834 --> 01:35:01,714
I just...
Go away.

801
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:05,443
You were looking for this letter.

802
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:09,280
In which you've
begged Birju's fatherâ€œ

803
01:35:09,467 --> 01:35:11,469
To give the kids' another chance.

804
01:35:13,534 --> 01:35:17,710
You forgot the principles
that you taught me.

805
01:35:18,634 --> 01:35:21,945
My principle was also
not to read others' letters.

806
01:35:22,367 --> 01:35:25,780
I haven't read it!
I haven't even opened it.

807
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,972
But I know you Well.

808
01:35:33,234 --> 01:35:35,612
I too can read your mind.

809
01:35:35,734 --> 01:35:39,739
Tell me honestly...
don't you miss him?

810
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:43,811
You are Wrong.
I've forgotten him.

811
01:35:44,734 --> 01:35:47,305
Why are you lying?

812
01:35:48,301 --> 01:35:49,837
You remember everything.
Mother !

813
01:35:51,567 --> 01:35:57,415
If he loved me, he would
be here not back home!

814
01:37:36,367 --> 01:37:38,313
Brother !
You've come!

815
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:41,947
I searched for you everywhere.
I was so Worried.

816
01:37:42,201 --> 01:37:45,842
Everybody is Worried.
Don't worry. I've spoken to mom.

817
01:37:46,067 --> 01:37:48,479
How is Neha's mother?
Much better.

818
01:37:48,867 --> 01:37:51,370
See that Window?

819
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,004
They are there.

820
01:37:59,634 --> 01:38:05,812
She had told me not to
show her my face again.

821
01:38:07,467 --> 01:38:10,277
But she never said I can't see her!

822
01:39:15,367 --> 01:39:18,507
Earlier even I'd sleep like this.

823
01:39:18,534 --> 01:39:23,176
My mother would slap
me softly and say..

824
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,677
Is this how you'll become a doctor?

825
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,714
Is your father a doctor?
No, he's a driver.

826
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,080
But the oar was a doctor's.

827
01:39:33,734 --> 01:39:36,806
It was his dream I become a doctor.

828
01:39:37,334 --> 01:39:42,113
They Wanted their son to
be called a doctor not driver.

829
01:39:43,234 --> 01:39:44,838
They must be very happy now.

830
01:39:51,267 --> 01:39:54,737
The reports are good...
She is improving

831
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:01,906
Pm fine. You do so much for others.

832
01:40:02,067 --> 01:40:06,345
Even this late at night...
The patients and I are alone.

833
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:09,677
You must have heard the saying...
One and one makes two

834
01:40:09,701 --> 01:40:12,648
But when one is lonely,
the formula completely changes

835
01:40:12,767 --> 01:40:16,180
Do you know how much is
one lonely man plus another.

836
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:19,543
Nobody.

837
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,542
I found this in the pipe.

838
01:40:36,201 --> 01:40:37,771
This is an old coin.

839
01:40:38,067 --> 01:40:40,013
Go and give it upstairs.

840
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,702
I won't go.
Why?

841
01:40:41,801 --> 01:40:45,510
He'll start again.

842
01:40:48,034 --> 01:40:50,514
Okay. Give it to me.

843
01:41:16,701 --> 01:41:19,978
The World's most beautiful tower.

844
01:41:22,234 --> 01:41:25,704
On the banks of the Thames.

845
01:41:34,967 --> 01:41:36,310
Yes?

846
01:41:36,734 --> 01:41:39,772
We found this in the pipe.

847
01:41:45,301 --> 01:41:46,939
Dad!

848
01:41:48,034 --> 01:41:51,743
Your coin of Jahangir!
Where did you find it?

849
01:41:52,034 --> 01:41:54,605
Downstairs sir.
Dad was so Worried.

850
01:41:54,867 --> 01:41:56,608
Dad lost it.

851
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:05,577
This is an incident not a coin.

852
01:42:05,834 --> 01:42:09,839
No, a piece . . .of history!

853
01:42:10,367 --> 01:42:13,143
Madam gave it to Dad!

854
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,540
Ask Why.
Why sir?

855
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:19,076
Once What happened. . .
We'll sit and listen.

856
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:23,273
Dad was Washing madam's
clothes for two years.

857
01:42:23,434 --> 01:42:25,277
And would talk to her in English.

858
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:29,209
But the funny part is
he did not know English!

859
01:42:30,267 --> 01:42:31,769
Then how did he talk?

860
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:37,112
Whatever she said in English.

861
01:42:37,301 --> 01:42:39,941
Dad would latch on to
the last 2 Words

862
01:42:40,534 --> 01:42:42,946
Suppose she said. .

863
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:49,449
She Wouldn't even realise
Dad had caught it...

864
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,646
Then she said...

865
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:55,874
Dad said, lot of soap?

866
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,738
Once matters got twisted.

867
01:42:58,967 --> 01:43:02,278
Once she said, you're so sweet!

868
01:43:03,234 --> 01:43:06,704
Dad said, so sweet?

869
01:43:10,367 --> 01:43:12,677
He said one minute and ran!

870
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,506
And bought sweets.
He bought a box of sweets!

871
01:43:15,801 --> 01:43:19,271
It's then that madam realised
Dad can't understand English.

872
01:43:19,634 --> 01:43:22,444
But she was happy to see the sweets.

873
01:43:22,667 --> 01:43:26,877
In return she gave him
a box of old coins.

874
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:31,276
Look at these coins.

875
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:34,877
So many coins?

876
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:37,845
She went back to England.

877
01:43:38,434 --> 01:43:41,643
Dad was left pining...

878
01:43:43,101 --> 01:43:45,411
He couldn't collect enough money.

879
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,306
On his death bed, he held
my hand and said...

880
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,810
Now I'll see madam's
England through your eyes.

881
01:43:55,467 --> 01:43:58,311
People sigh on dying...

882
01:43:59,267 --> 01:44:05,240
But before dying, Dad said...

883
01:44:06,434 --> 01:44:07,970
Sir, you will go.

884
01:44:08,067 --> 01:44:10,604
I will definitely go!

885
01:44:10,934 --> 01:44:13,847
I've somehow collected 60000 bucks!

886
01:44:14,201 --> 01:44:17,842
I'll get at least 40 or
50000 for these coins.

887
01:44:18,334 --> 01:44:20,245
I will go! Positively!

888
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,811
You've made me very happy today.

889
01:44:23,101 --> 01:44:24,580
I'll make you happy!

890
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,412
At 50 paise per garment...

891
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:37,177
- 500 bucks advance for 1000 garments!

892
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,342
You keep this and ï¬‚y kites.

893
01:44:44,801 --> 01:44:47,782
What's the matter?

894
01:44:49,134 --> 01:44:51,910
<i>Sir, it's my â€œE's first earning.</i>

895
01:44:52,567 --> 01:44:54,046
Thank you sir.

896
01:44:59,834 --> 01:45:02,007
Sir, 50 bucks for that day's call.

897
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:05,874
No. Forget it.
No sir. Please.

898
01:45:09,934 --> 01:45:11,641
Saw that?

899
01:45:16,334 --> 01:45:21,147
I'll Write to mother

900
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,002
See that girl?

901
01:45:49,001 --> 01:45:50,708
Give her this ï¬‚ower.

902
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:36,671
Many years ago, I too

903
01:46:37,967 --> 01:46:39,947
In this very place...

904
01:46:41,301 --> 01:46:44,111
...gave somebody a ï¬‚ower.

905
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:51,038
You returned a lost moment to me.

906
01:46:55,167 --> 01:47:01,607
By the Way, the end to my
love story was very painful.

907
01:47:02,201 --> 01:47:03,407
What happened?

908
01:47:05,634 --> 01:47:07,477
We got married!

909
01:47:10,867 --> 01:47:12,676
We got married!

910
01:47:13,334 --> 01:47:17,749
The roses that would make her
cheeks pink before marriage...

911
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:23,045
...With shame, she now turns
red with rage at the same roses.

912
01:47:24,367 --> 01:47:26,278
Flowers have become expensive.

913
01:47:26,734 --> 01:47:29,510
Stop it. Talking through
your hat in front of kids!

914
01:47:29,567 --> 01:47:33,037
Fill my mouth with ice cream and
I'll shut up. Will you have some?

915
01:47:33,234 --> 01:47:37,046
He's not allowed to eat
So he's finding excuses.

916
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,647
One has to find
excuses for everything.

917
01:47:39,801 --> 01:47:41,906
Look at the cruelty of life.

918
01:47:42,068 --> 01:47:45,379
One should have a reason to live.

919
01:47:46,034 --> 01:47:48,378
Even if it be just memories.

920
01:47:48,967 --> 01:47:51,504
And life is easy to live.

921
01:47:51,667 --> 01:47:56,980
Today is your time.
Go and make your memories.

922
01:47:57,534 --> 01:48:00,310
Memories are the staff of old age.

923
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:04,143
And man starts off
with it for support.

924
01:48:04,467 --> 01:48:08,176
Like We're setting off.

925
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:16,243
You remind me of my son.

926
01:48:23,167 --> 01:48:26,580
You returned a past moment to us.

927
01:48:27,301 --> 01:48:29,474
Which is priceless.

928
01:48:30,667 --> 01:48:33,978
If I can ever help you..

929
01:48:35,067 --> 01:48:37,570
Keep this card of mine.

930
01:48:41,534 --> 01:48:44,208
Come over if you need anything.

931
01:48:55,934 --> 01:48:59,939
Dear mother, I have neither
stolen nor borrowed this money.

932
01:49:00,434 --> 01:49:02,436
This is my first earning.

933
01:49:02,601 --> 01:49:07,209
I'll be glad if father considers...

934
01:49:07,367 --> 01:49:09,847
...it Worthy of being placed
at the mother goddess' feet.

935
01:49:09,968 --> 01:49:12,539
Pm sending the first pay home.

936
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:18,548
Pm missing but my address is
the same Wherever you are.

937
01:49:22,034 --> 01:49:23,877
Hope you're at peace now!

938
01:49:24,034 --> 01:49:27,140
You were always after my baby!

939
01:49:27,334 --> 01:49:29,644
Only you are his mother.

940
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,178
He means nothing to me.

941
01:49:33,667 --> 01:49:38,013
If you loved him so much, you would
not have snatched away his happiness.

942
01:49:38,267 --> 01:49:42,272
Stop it.
As if all the fault is mine

943
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:44,407
What about what he did?

944
01:49:53,334 --> 01:49:55,507
The rascal didn't
even Write his address!

945
01:50:03,767 --> 01:50:08,648
But I'm glad at least
he's started earning .

946
01:50:10,634 --> 01:50:12,045
Son...

947
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:16,772
Place the money at the goddess' altar.

948
01:50:40,167 --> 01:50:41,942
How are you?
Fine.

949
01:50:44,467 --> 01:50:46,071
I came to return this.

950
01:50:46,667 --> 01:50:48,305
The deposit for the room.

951
01:50:48,467 --> 01:50:50,071
There was no hurry for it.

952
01:50:50,267 --> 01:50:56,650
I cannot repay the value that
the money had for me that day.

953
01:50:57,068 --> 01:50:58,638
Hence Pm returning it.

954
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:01,476
Did you have to sell something?

955
01:51:01,767 --> 01:51:06,216
Please keep it. Maybe it will
be of use to somebody else someday.

956
01:51:07,134 --> 01:51:09,478
Who may not have anything to sell.

957
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:17,577
I closely know of many who
have nothing to sell.

958
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:20,979
My Dad was a driver.
He had a lot of vices.

959
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:23,944
Once he left he never returned.

960
01:51:24,134 --> 01:51:29,880
Why? Because everything in
the house was sold for his treatment.

961
01:51:30,634 --> 01:51:33,581
When the money kept for my
education was being used...

962
01:51:33,734 --> 01:51:38,274
He got up as usual, switched off
my night lamp, tucked me in...

963
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,241
And went away.

964
01:51:42,101 --> 01:51:45,947
Had he been here today,
he would have been treated.

965
01:51:49,801 --> 01:51:53,476
Herds your dose for today.
For your smile.

966
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:07,942
Washer man! Call Bhigelal.

967
01:52:08,467 --> 01:52:09,775
He knows it.

968
01:52:10,067 --> 01:52:12,547
You do your Work. Call him.

969
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:17,747
Your parents taught you to
wear a watch but no manners!

970
01:52:18,767 --> 01:52:21,714
You come to London Laundry
and talk to me like this!

971
01:52:22,134 --> 01:52:23,772
Who are you?

972
01:52:47,568 --> 01:52:49,946
Are you Bhigelal?
Yes... No!

973
01:52:50,167 --> 01:52:52,875
Pm just a servant.
Sir is sitting upstairs.

974
01:52:53,101 --> 01:52:56,810
Please be seated. I'll call him.

975
01:52:58,234 --> 01:53:02,080
But sir...
Now you are sir not me!

976
01:53:02,401 --> 01:53:05,245
What do I see? He has
seen me in my pajamas.

977
01:53:05,468 --> 01:53:07,573
Will he give 50000 for these coins?

978
01:53:07,767 --> 01:53:11,544
He'll run away! God knows
what I said to him!

979
01:53:11,567 --> 01:53:13,672
I can't do this sir!

980
01:53:15,767 --> 01:53:18,077
My dream will break.

981
01:53:19,034 --> 01:53:20,911
You know what a dream is?

982
01:53:23,034 --> 01:53:26,243
Yes sir. I know what a dream is.

983
01:53:32,601 --> 01:53:37,175
This is Bhigelal. He owns
this shop and this collection.

984
01:53:39,967 --> 01:53:42,379
Pm very eager to see your collection.

985
01:53:43,134 --> 01:53:44,977
It's not my collection sir.

986
01:53:45,734 --> 01:53:47,111
It's Dad's!

987
01:53:48,234 --> 01:53:51,215
My Dad.. I mean his Dad
selected... collected it.

988
01:53:51,434 --> 01:53:53,277
Now you select it.

989
01:53:55,701 --> 01:53:59,478
I'll get the seeing glass.

990
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:06,270
This belongs to Shahjehan's era.

991
01:54:09,068 --> 01:54:12,515
Yes.
What did you say about it?

992
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:16,474
Something special about it...

993
01:54:18,434 --> 01:54:22,348
Yes I'd written to you.
Let me have a look.

994
01:54:23,667 --> 01:54:26,011
This is not a coin sir.
It's an incident...

995
01:54:26,767 --> 01:54:28,542
What incident?

996
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:37,646
That. . riverside...

997
01:54:37,901 --> 01:54:40,404
The strains of the hymns.

998
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:42,874
Thousands of lamps.

999
01:54:43,034 --> 01:54:46,504
And a glimpse of the goddess.

1000
01:54:47,167 --> 01:54:48,407
Goddess?

1001
01:54:51,534 --> 01:54:56,916
She was bathing in the river
when Shahjehan first saw her.

1002
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:01,313
Looking at her, he fell in love.

1003
01:55:02,201 --> 01:55:07,480
And Mumtaz slowly put
this coin in his hand.

1004
01:55:09,534 --> 01:55:13,414
Wow! Excellent Bir. . Bhigelal.

1005
01:55:14,934 --> 01:55:16,641
And this is Jehangir's coin.

1006
01:55:17,367 --> 01:55:20,610
Does this also have some story?

1007
01:55:21,367 --> 01:55:23,540
Story? It's a portion.

1008
01:55:24,568 --> 01:55:25,945
A part of history.

1009
01:55:26,567 --> 01:55:28,569
Very integral part.
Then. . . ?

1010
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:32,779
All the lamps had been switched off.

1011
01:55:33,567 --> 01:55:39,813
The slave at the door told Saleem,
Anarkali has left everything and gone.

1012
01:55:40,834 --> 01:55:42,905
Saleem

1013
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,971
Right then there was a sound.

1014
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:54,340
Saleem turned and reached...

1015
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:55,979
...Anarkali.

1016
01:55:56,901 --> 01:55:59,211
He asked her Why she did this.

1017
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:03,241
She screamed that your Dad
was not in favour of our match.

1018
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:07,275
Now I'll never show you my face!

1019
01:56:10,367 --> 01:56:11,641
What happened?

1020
01:56:13,434 --> 01:56:17,177
I can't do this.

1021
01:56:20,034 --> 01:56:22,412
I can't do this!

1022
01:56:23,834 --> 01:56:25,780
I swore I Wouldn't lie.

1023
01:56:25,967 --> 01:56:28,504
Sir, you...
You are the sir.

1024
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:31,876
Pm just
He's fooling.

1025
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:34,808
I swore never to tell lies.

1026
01:56:35,167 --> 01:56:39,547
We cheated you. If you leave,
his father's dream will break.

1027
01:56:40,167 --> 01:56:41,612
He is Bhigelal.

1028
01:56:53,234 --> 01:56:55,214
Forgive me.

1029
01:56:56,667 --> 01:56:58,544
Where are you taking the coins?

1030
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:01,042
You maybe a liar but
the coins are genuine.

1031
01:57:01,467 --> 01:57:03,743
I'll pay you 65000 for it. Fine?

1032
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:07,838
- 65000 rupees?

1033
01:57:09,534 --> 01:57:12,174
You've bought my Dad's collection?

1034
01:57:15,034 --> 01:57:19,346
My Dad's dream has come true!

1035
01:57:19,701 --> 01:57:23,410
I'll Wash your and your
family's clothes all my life!

1036
01:57:23,901 --> 01:57:25,881
What can I do for you?

1037
01:57:26,367 --> 01:57:28,313
You have to make a call. Please.

1038
01:57:29,467 --> 01:57:31,037
What do I do for you?

1039
01:57:32,001 --> 01:57:35,346
Dad! Pm coming! No...

1040
01:57:35,501 --> 01:57:37,845
Pm going to London!

1041
01:57:43,668 --> 01:57:44,806
Yours.

1042
01:57:44,834 --> 01:57:54,414
Tie the ribbon.

1043
01:57:58,634 --> 01:58:01,342
Again? How many times
will you count them?

1044
01:58:01,867 --> 01:58:03,346
They'll remain the same?
Yes sir.

1045
01:58:04,801 --> 01:58:07,611
I've been Waiting for 32 years.

1046
01:58:08,534 --> 01:58:12,676
I can't believe that Pm
going to London in 2 days.

1047
01:58:15,334 --> 01:58:16,711
Get up!

1048
01:58:17,368 --> 01:58:19,439
The cupboard key is under this.

1049
01:58:20,701 --> 01:58:25,810
I'll dress up and go to London!

1050
01:58:27,334 --> 01:58:31,942
When my Dad died,
he left behind 2 things.

1051
01:58:32,234 --> 01:58:35,238
The coins and me!

1052
01:58:36,367 --> 01:58:40,543
Today there are 125000 bucks
in here!

1053
01:58:41,101 --> 01:58:44,139
Look at this map of London.

1054
01:58:44,567 --> 01:58:47,173
Madam's house.

1055
01:58:48,034 --> 01:58:52,642
Dad would look at
this map day and night.

1056
01:58:52,867 --> 01:58:55,108
I'll show you my preparations. Come.

1057
01:58:58,367 --> 01:58:59,812
Binoculars.

1058
01:59:00,934 --> 01:59:07,510
One can see stars with
this but not England.

1059
01:59:08,934 --> 01:59:10,004
Come here.

1060
01:59:10,268 --> 01:59:15,013
Far off things appear close.

1061
01:59:15,801 --> 01:59:19,010
Look at the beauty outside.

1062
01:59:19,201 --> 01:59:21,078
See anything?

1063
01:59:27,768 --> 01:59:29,213
What's the matter?

1064
01:59:58,234 --> 01:59:59,713
Are you a relative?

1065
01:59:59,734 --> 02:00:02,613
Deposit 20000 bucks at the counter.

1066
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:05,403
Deposit for ICU.
We have to operate.

1067
02:00:06,267 --> 02:00:08,110
How much will the operation cost?

1068
02:00:08,267 --> 02:00:10,474
Lakh or so. Hurry up.

1069
02:00:31,067 --> 02:00:34,071
You've come back after
counting the stars?

1070
02:00:34,567 --> 02:00:36,342
Didn't they seem very close?

1071
02:00:36,667 --> 02:00:40,205
I want money.
Money? Here, take it.

1072
02:00:40,434 --> 02:00:43,608
Have fun. I'll manage.

1073
02:00:46,067 --> 02:00:48,377
More? Here.

1074
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:51,904
Go. Keep it.

1075
02:00:53,267 --> 02:00:55,508
More?

1076
02:00:56,301 --> 02:00:58,372
Just tell me how much you Want.

1077
02:00:58,901 --> 02:01:01,074
A lakh and a quarter.

1078
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,309
Give me the binoculars.

1079
02:01:06,201 --> 02:01:08,943
Said he swore never to lie.

1080
02:01:08,967 --> 02:01:11,743
Doesn't your promise
break by joking?

1081
02:01:12,367 --> 02:01:16,042
Joking! Go and count stars.
Let me count my notes.

1082
02:01:23,134 --> 02:01:28,106
Come immediately.
Mother is very unwell.

1083
02:01:29,567 --> 02:01:31,638
I made you promise.

1084
02:01:32,334 --> 02:01:34,211
But now Pm breaking it.

1085
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:39,312
Come back Birju.

1086
02:01:41,701 --> 02:01:42,805
Just a minute.

1087
02:01:47,234 --> 02:01:52,308
Mother is serious.
We must operate immediately.

1088
02:01:52,434 --> 02:01:54,141
There maybe a lot of expenditure.

1089
02:01:54,434 --> 02:01:56,141
A lakh and a quarter.

1090
02:01:57,667 --> 02:02:00,273
But We will operate.

1091
02:02:00,734 --> 02:02:04,807
I told you I'd filled
a form for my Dad.

1092
02:02:05,234 --> 02:02:09,705
The doctor's relatives are
treated free of charge.

1093
02:02:09,867 --> 02:02:12,313
But Whom do We have?

1094
02:02:13,101 --> 02:02:16,571
The Director asked me the same
question, how are We related?

1095
02:02:17,267 --> 02:02:18,575
Then gave me the form.

1096
02:02:18,767 --> 02:02:21,873
The form Where every
relation has a name.

1097
02:02:22,034 --> 02:02:25,481
Which can be classified. So I...

1098
02:02:37,001 --> 02:02:42,952
I gave the answer that the director
and committee will understand.

1099
02:02:46,234 --> 02:02:48,976
I've told them that...

1100
02:02:51,334 --> 02:02:53,473
We are getting married.

1101
02:02:56,934 --> 02:03:00,848
I know it is Wrong but
there is no other option.

1102
02:03:01,801 --> 02:03:06,307
I just know that this
is the only option open.

1103
02:03:09,601 --> 02:03:11,979
Either you sign this form.

1104
02:03:13,734 --> 02:03:16,738
Or I'll tell them We're not operating

1105
02:04:39,434 --> 02:04:40,879
Son, you?

1106
02:04:41,301 --> 02:04:43,713
This late? Come in.

1107
02:04:44,801 --> 02:04:46,144
See who has come.

1108
02:04:50,301 --> 02:04:54,249
Don't Worry son. You'll get the
money you Want for the operation.

1109
02:04:55,001 --> 02:04:57,811
I'll slog day and night
to repay your obligation.

1110
02:04:57,967 --> 02:05:01,642
But We are retired.
Where will We get the money?

1111
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:04,405
You Well know Where the
money will come from.

1112
02:05:04,567 --> 02:05:06,547
Son, the lottery here...

1113
02:05:06,801 --> 02:05:09,577
I can't do that.

1114
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:15,140
Why not? We've lost one son.
You Want the other to be ruined?

1115
02:05:15,267 --> 02:05:16,905
What happened aunt?

1116
02:05:17,134 --> 02:05:22,550
Call me mother. Had my son been
here, he would call me mother.

1117
02:05:22,701 --> 02:05:25,682
I had told you not
to talk about this.

1118
02:05:26,234 --> 02:05:30,410
Your honesty and principles
snatched away my son!

1119
02:05:31,867 --> 02:05:36,907
For my sake, if you want
to erase my sorrow...

1120
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:39,880
Don't send this son away
empty handed.

1121
02:05:45,768 --> 02:05:47,679
All right.

1122
02:05:48,301 --> 02:05:53,580
If anybody else hears about this I..

1123
02:05:55,767 --> 02:05:59,909
The fact is the lottery run here..

1124
02:06:00,067 --> 02:06:02,604
. Is full of corruption.

1125
02:06:02,734 --> 02:06:05,578
Tickets are printed for name sake.

1126
02:06:05,801 --> 02:06:08,509
The Winning ticket
Worth lakhs only goes to...

1127
02:06:08,634 --> 02:06:11,740
The one who gives big bribes.

1128
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,777
He was in the ministry.
Hence he knows all this.

1129
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:20,541
I never asked anything for myself.

1130
02:06:21,201 --> 02:06:25,547
But one thing is sure, in my
long service I earned respect.

1131
02:06:25,701 --> 02:06:31,947
If I ask for the Winning ticket
the ministry won't refuse me.

1132
02:06:32,701 --> 02:06:35,705
If We can somehow arrange
for 7000 or 8000.

1133
02:06:35,967 --> 02:06:39,210
I'll earn that much myself.
By Working hard.

1134
02:08:04,367 --> 02:08:07,974
This is 3282. I'll get
the rest by tomorrow.

1135
02:08:08,234 --> 02:08:12,614
Did you think We'd
Wait for your money?

1136
02:08:13,534 --> 02:08:15,343
I pawned my chain.

1137
02:08:15,734 --> 02:08:18,613
Your ticket has come.
The result will be declared tomorrow.

1138
02:08:20,734 --> 02:08:22,407
But mother, your chain...

1139
02:08:22,701 --> 02:08:25,807
When you Win, bring it back for me.

1140
02:08:27,501 --> 02:08:29,003
Both of you are...
No!

1141
02:08:30,001 --> 02:08:34,177
Don't adulate us.
We're humans of ï¬‚esh and bone.

1142
02:08:35,234 --> 02:08:39,307
Seeing you, I felt
my son has returned.

1143
02:08:39,567 --> 02:08:45,108
Under the pretext of helping you
We too are blessed with some joy.

1144
02:08:48,801 --> 02:08:51,543
Tomorrow a new life begins for you.

1145
02:08:51,767 --> 02:08:54,373
Treat Neha's mother with the money.

1146
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:57,538
Your promise will be kept.
Here mistress.

1147
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:00,873
I'll make it. Take this.

1148
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:04,474
Give these ï¬‚owers
to Neha on our behalf.

1149
02:09:07,434 --> 02:09:09,846
Herds your ticket.

1150
02:09:12,934 --> 02:09:17,076
But I want something
from you in return.

1151
02:09:18,167 --> 02:09:21,171
Do you know how
expensive ï¬‚owers are?

1152
02:09:21,467 --> 02:09:25,381
She won't let me buy.
You give me some ï¬‚owers.

1153
02:09:54,534 --> 02:09:57,208
There's a call for you.

1154
02:10:10,534 --> 02:10:13,310
Birju here.

1155
02:10:14,234 --> 02:10:16,236
Say something.

1156
02:10:17,801 --> 02:10:20,975
Yes, ifs me.
Pm coming with the money.

1157
02:10:21,701 --> 02:10:25,046
I'd said till I get the money
I won't show you my face.

1158
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:27,371
Pm coming. I've kept my Word.

1159
02:10:27,834 --> 02:10:29,871
I've got money! Lakhs!

1160
02:10:32,267 --> 02:10:34,042
Lakhs?
Yes! Lakhs!

1161
02:10:34,467 --> 02:10:37,311
I Won a lottery!
Really?

1162
02:10:37,734 --> 02:10:41,773
Yes. And listen...
are you listening?

1163
02:10:43,534 --> 02:10:46,674
I love you very much.

1164
02:10:48,767 --> 02:10:51,008
You also say that you love me.

1165
02:10:51,101 --> 02:10:54,446
And you're not mad at me.

1166
02:10:54,567 --> 02:10:56,911
Enough. Just come over.

1167
02:10:57,134 --> 02:10:59,410
Yes. Pm coming tomorrow.

1168
02:11:00,234 --> 02:11:04,808
Yes. Wait for me.
I'll be coming tomorrow.

1169
02:11:05,667 --> 02:11:08,375
Yes, come Birju.

1170
02:13:42,534 --> 02:13:45,037
The stamp is of your shop.

1171
02:13:45,434 --> 02:13:47,243
Have a look.
Yes it is of my shop.

1172
02:13:47,367 --> 02:13:49,608
They bought the entire
bundle for 1000 rupees.

1173
02:13:49,767 --> 02:13:52,213
And sold it to you for lakhs.
What can I do?

1174
02:13:52,334 --> 02:13:54,541
But what happened?
The uncle and aunt

1175
02:13:54,701 --> 02:13:56,578
What happened to them?
They are thieves!

1176
02:13:56,767 --> 02:13:58,713
They cheated the entire
town and vanished.

1177
02:13:59,001 --> 02:14:01,345
They can't do this.
I have their card.

1178
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:04,137
So What? They've given
everybody their cards.

1179
02:14:04,334 --> 02:14:05,813
Let's burn them up!
How can I?

1180
02:14:05,967 --> 02:14:11,041
I got taken in by their talk
and even sold my ï¬‚ower shop!

1181
02:14:12,101 --> 02:14:13,808
Thank God your house Wasn't sold.

1182
02:14:13,834 --> 02:14:16,110
They cheated the cottage
owners of 25000 bucks!

1183
02:14:16,301 --> 02:14:19,145
I'll slaughter them if I see them!

1184
02:14:19,501 --> 02:14:21,981
Where will you find them?
They've left the cottage.

1185
02:14:22,434 --> 02:14:24,414
We'll all kill them

1186
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:43,045
Why are you banging at the door?

1187
02:14:46,368 --> 02:14:49,212
They have gone!

1188
02:14:49,734 --> 02:14:52,180
Stole everything and left!

1189
02:14:53,434 --> 02:14:56,142
Didn't even spare me!

1190
02:14:56,734 --> 02:15:02,343
They said I reminded
them of their son.

1191
02:15:07,767 --> 02:15:12,045
I am ruined!

1192
02:15:35,634 --> 02:15:37,113
Sit down.

1193
02:15:39,501 --> 02:15:42,209
Calm down. He will come.

1194
02:15:42,367 --> 02:15:44,608
He won't come now. It's 11 p.m.

1195
02:15:45,101 --> 02:15:49,106
He's coming from Riwasa.
It will take him time.

1196
02:15:49,401 --> 02:15:51,642
He lied again.

1197
02:15:52,301 --> 02:15:54,144
Why will he lie?

1198
02:15:55,367 --> 02:15:57,278
Mother, he won't come!

1199
02:16:06,401 --> 02:16:07,778
What's the matter?

1200
02:16:09,767 --> 02:16:11,337
What's the matter?

1201
02:16:17,367 --> 02:16:19,813
I want to say something to you.

1202
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,480
About what happened to me.

1203
02:16:23,367 --> 02:16:28,043
That's over. Do you know Why
God gave us eyes in the front?

1204
02:16:28,201 --> 02:16:33,446
He could have put one at the back.
He only Wants us to see ahead.

1205
02:16:33,868 --> 02:16:35,779
And do you know What's ahead?

1206
02:16:37,567 --> 02:16:39,410
Mother's latest reports are good.

1207
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:42,945
After the operation,
I promise she'll be fine.

1208
02:16:48,201 --> 02:16:52,377
Remember you said,
We should decide for ourselves.

1209
02:16:52,501 --> 02:16:54,412
I've taken a decision.

1210
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:57,346
I'll marry the doctor.

1211
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:07,137
He's a very nice man.

1212
02:17:07,834 --> 02:17:12,078
Doesn't tell lies or steal.
Or hurt anybody.

1213
02:17:13,434 --> 02:17:15,710
He will look after you.

1214
02:17:18,167 --> 02:17:22,377
I respect him a lot.
Do you love him?

1215
02:17:32,134 --> 02:17:33,670
Brother! Come to your senses.

1216
02:17:33,867 --> 02:17:35,540
Why should I come to my senses?

1217
02:17:35,734 --> 02:17:38,408
This is not correct.
Then what is?

1218
02:17:38,567 --> 02:17:40,774
Is it all right for Neha's
mother to die untreated?

1219
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,344
Go and ask your teacher!

1220
02:17:43,934 --> 02:17:48,110
A person Whose mother is
dying Without treatment...

1221
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:52,544
From Where will he bring a lakh?

1222
02:17:52,834 --> 02:17:55,110
By Washing clothes?
Or ironing them?

1223
02:17:55,434 --> 02:17:58,506
From Where?

1224
02:18:03,234 --> 02:18:04,872
You've gone mad.

1225
02:18:06,734 --> 02:18:08,213
Pm going back.

1226
02:18:08,601 --> 02:18:11,946
I'll tell your parents everything.

1227
02:18:12,667 --> 02:18:14,237
I'm going-

1228
02:18:21,334 --> 02:18:23,405
Tell me what to do.

1229
02:18:24,134 --> 02:18:28,514
On one hand are your dreams.
On the other Neha's mother's death.

1230
02:18:29,034 --> 02:18:32,846
Dreams can Wait, not death.

1231
02:18:33,934 --> 02:18:38,849
I'll Work all my life for you
and return every penny.

1232
02:18:39,634 --> 02:18:42,547
You may not believe this story.

1233
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:47,649
Hence Pm leaving behind..
the lottery ticket.

1234
02:18:48,867 --> 02:18:50,608
Keep it.

1235
02:18:51,434 --> 02:18:54,005
It's like my life.

1236
02:18:54,601 --> 02:18:56,945
And my fate. A fraud!

1237
02:19:32,367 --> 02:19:34,074
What are you doing here?
Who are you?

1238
02:19:45,534 --> 02:19:46,911
Pm telling you repeatedly...

1239
02:19:47,101 --> 02:19:49,877
Till you tell me who you are
I can't take this money!

1240
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,742
Do you ask all patients?
All right I'll ask Neha!

1241
02:19:52,967 --> 02:19:54,207
BIO!

1242
02:19:55,167 --> 02:19:57,340
Don't tell her anything.

1243
02:19:58,534 --> 02:20:02,676
She won't take them.
Why not? Where are they from?

1244
02:20:12,934 --> 02:20:14,675
Who are you?

1245
02:20:14,734 --> 02:20:17,214
Why are you crying?
We are going to him.

1246
02:20:21,634 --> 02:20:23,841
If something happens to him...?

1247
02:20:25,501 --> 02:20:27,378
Don't tell anyone.

1248
02:20:28,267 --> 02:20:29,575
I won't tell.

1249
02:20:31,934 --> 02:20:35,279
Keep this money.

1250
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:41,204
Her uncle has sent it!

1251
02:20:41,634 --> 02:20:43,636
He has many cloth mills.

1252
02:20:44,067 --> 02:20:45,910
The material is sent all over India.

1253
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:49,513
But she said they have no relatives.

1254
02:20:52,267 --> 02:20:55,248
Her saying doesn't turn
family into strangers.

1255
02:20:57,567 --> 02:21:03,347
He only Wants her mother to be saved!

1256
02:21:04,067 --> 02:21:06,479
That is Why he sent this money.

1257
02:21:06,934 --> 02:21:11,144
If something happens to mother...

1258
02:21:25,167 --> 02:21:26,237
Who is it?

1259
02:21:26,434 --> 02:21:29,278
He is Birju's Dad.
Where is he?

1260
02:21:29,534 --> 02:21:31,343
How did you come in?

1261
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,637
The door was open.

1262
02:21:41,567 --> 02:21:44,707
My money!

1263
02:22:17,801 --> 02:22:20,907
Don't know how it happened...

1264
02:22:21,567 --> 02:22:24,571
He's got a mad fit.

1265
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:28,145
There's been a theft
in London Laundry.

1266
02:22:28,300 --> 02:22:31,304
- 125000! For a few rupees...

1267
02:22:31,867 --> 02:22:33,141
He stole everything!

1268
02:22:33,667 --> 02:22:37,638
Your Birju stole everything!

1269
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:41,980
The night you came,
he had come, too.

1270
02:22:42,233 --> 02:22:44,213
What he didn't do for you...

1271
02:22:44,434 --> 02:22:47,005
He Washed clothes, swept the rooms.

1272
02:22:47,234 --> 02:22:50,681
He stayed awake at
nights and Washed trucks.

1273
02:22:50,834 --> 02:22:54,611
Earned money. Everything is lost.

1274
02:23:02,233 --> 02:23:04,008
Where is he?

1275
02:23:04,167 --> 02:23:06,044
Where is he?

1276
02:23:09,767 --> 02:23:12,270
Sir, please forgive me.

1277
02:23:13,733 --> 02:23:15,872
I had written I won't go away.

1278
02:23:16,034 --> 02:23:18,241
I'll be your slave.
Slave?

1279
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,538
You and slave? Never!

1280
02:23:23,167 --> 02:23:25,511
Pm not Diwanji.

1281
02:23:25,667 --> 02:23:29,171
You are a king, an emperor!

1282
02:23:29,467 --> 02:23:34,246
You are the prince
and Pm your slave.

1283
02:23:37,767 --> 02:23:39,508
WEB-pen!

1284
02:23:40,367 --> 02:23:42,643
I want a Weapon! Weapon!

1285
02:23:43,501 --> 02:23:46,072
I won't go anywhere!
He's gone into shock.

1286
02:23:46,167 --> 02:23:47,669
He's escaped from the hospital.

1287
02:23:48,034 --> 02:23:52,642
Wash room! I won't spare you!

1288
02:23:53,334 --> 02:23:56,440
He cried and yelled.
Then laughed like a madman.

1289
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:02,672
With great difficulty your Dad
and brother took him to hospital.

1290
02:24:02,833 --> 02:24:04,540
Dad is here?

1291
02:24:04,901 --> 02:24:08,110
Found it!

1292
02:24:11,267 --> 02:24:13,144
He's talking of Dad.

1293
02:24:14,300 --> 02:24:15,938
Be sensible.

1294
02:24:16,167 --> 02:24:18,704
I'm no prince just a petty thief!

1295
02:24:33,634 --> 02:24:35,045
You're a thief?

1296
02:24:35,233 --> 02:24:39,909
You would have run away.
You're petty? Absolutely Wrong!

1297
02:24:40,534 --> 02:24:44,175
Only you can Win a bet of lakhs.

1298
02:24:44,334 --> 02:24:49,340
How? Because you have this.

1299
02:24:50,267 --> 02:24:53,009
You have this!
You are mad!

1300
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,843
This is false, useless!

1301
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:58,243
It's useless?

1302
02:24:58,534 --> 02:25:01,014
It's not useless! It's a miracle!

1303
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:05,474
Pm not mad, you are!

1304
02:25:05,667 --> 02:25:09,171
Because you didn't ask, What?

1305
02:25:10,667 --> 02:25:12,374
Say it again.

1306
02:25:13,334 --> 02:25:16,440
What did you see at the
shop when you went there?

1307
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:18,580
People were yelling and shouting.

1308
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:22,338
What else? Everybody was
cursing uncle and aunt.

1309
02:25:22,567 --> 02:25:26,743
What else? Everybody had
similar tickets in their hand.

1310
02:25:26,934 --> 02:25:29,005
And?
What else would We see?

1311
02:25:29,134 --> 02:25:32,081
What you should have seen.

1312
02:25:32,301 --> 02:25:33,974
What you should have seen.

1313
02:25:34,167 --> 02:25:37,512
People crying...

1314
02:25:37,667 --> 02:25:41,740
They had a glance and went away.

1315
02:25:42,101 --> 02:25:44,411
They went away.

1316
02:25:44,833 --> 02:25:47,211
But they didn't see...

1317
02:25:47,467 --> 02:25:52,883
The number of the Winning ticket.

1318
02:25:53,167 --> 02:25:55,738
What is it?

1319
02:25:58,867 --> 02:26:01,143
You should have asked.

1320
02:26:01,301 --> 02:26:05,943
Those thieves sold many such
tickets to innocents like you.

1321
02:26:06,234 --> 02:26:10,046
But by chance if one of
those tickets does Win...?

1322
02:26:14,934 --> 02:26:18,404
So? Uncle and aunt were frauds.

1323
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:22,773
But the ticket was genuine.
The question arises, Who?

1324
02:26:23,334 --> 02:26:26,144
Who has the Winning ticket?

1325
02:26:26,834 --> 02:26:29,610
This question arose in my mind.

1326
02:26:30,334 --> 02:26:32,439
I called up and found out.

1327
02:26:33,567 --> 02:26:36,707
This is the Winning ticket.

1328
02:26:39,334 --> 02:26:41,109
It is this!

1329
02:26:42,433 --> 02:26:44,208
It is this!

1330
02:27:01,001 --> 02:27:04,471
It is right!

1331
02:27:05,701 --> 02:27:08,682
These men were after the ticket.

1332
02:27:10,533 --> 02:27:12,308
What are you doing? He's my Dad.

1333
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:13,504
Tell him.

1334
02:27:13,767 --> 02:27:16,509
We thought you were in
shock because of the theft.

1335
02:27:16,567 --> 02:27:20,845
So I went to find out.
Is this the number?

1336
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,378
It is.

1337
02:27:28,767 --> 02:27:30,940
I've Won a lottery!

1338
02:27:32,601 --> 02:27:34,342
Yes son!

1339
02:27:38,567 --> 02:27:41,070
You have the boon of
the goddess of Wealth.

1340
02:27:41,334 --> 02:27:45,714
You've Won 125000!

1341
02:27:45,867 --> 02:27:48,609
- 250000!

1342
02:27:48,834 --> 02:27:50,541
Whether it be 125000 or 250000...

1343
02:27:50,633 --> 02:27:53,079
It belongs to my son.

1344
02:27:53,101 --> 02:27:56,571
Neha's mother will be
treated by your money.

1345
02:27:57,134 --> 02:27:59,307
Come. Neha is calling you.

1346
02:27:59,967 --> 02:28:02,277
She's Waiting for you.

1347
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:18,877
Is everything fine?

1348
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:25,212
Doctor you saved my child's life.

1349
02:28:31,834 --> 02:28:33,643
Doctor's idea was good.

1350
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:36,881
But your acting was superb!

1351
02:28:37,567 --> 02:28:39,911
You did all that had to be done.

1352
02:28:40,101 --> 02:28:44,982
But I thought you had
ï¬‚oundered in between.

1353
02:28:45,233 --> 02:28:49,079
You said 250000 instead of 125000.

1354
02:28:49,767 --> 02:28:53,510
That's because I'll only be
able to see London in 125000.

1355
02:28:53,734 --> 02:28:56,146
But in 250000 I can see England!

1356
02:28:56,400 --> 02:28:58,038
On my expense?

1357
02:28:58,234 --> 02:29:01,272
We had a deal for 125000.
Not one penny over that!

1358
02:29:01,767 --> 02:29:03,178
- 250000!
125000!

1359
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:07,041
I lose my head very fast. 250000!
125000!

1360
02:29:07,301 --> 02:29:09,440
One moment, may I suggest something?

1361
02:29:11,333 --> 02:29:13,472
Call up the lottery office.

1362
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,513
You'll know Whether
its 125000 or 250000.

1363
02:29:16,833 --> 02:29:21,043
Shut up! You think We're fools?
Don't speak when you don't follow!

1364
02:29:21,867 --> 02:29:23,972
I understand everything.
What? What?

1365
02:29:25,167 --> 02:29:28,410
What do you understand?
Do you know what Birju did?

1366
02:29:28,867 --> 02:29:31,746
Robbery.
And what happens if he complains?

1367
02:29:35,334 --> 02:29:37,507
He'll be imprisoned.

1368
02:29:37,834 --> 02:29:41,714
So what do I have to do?

1369
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:44,480
Pm his father. So tell me.

1370
02:29:45,367 --> 02:29:47,608
Say, he'll have to return the money.

1371
02:29:48,701 --> 02:29:53,116
Tell me, What I did
to him in his Wedding...

1372
02:29:53,267 --> 02:29:55,838
Would he have taken money from me?

1373
02:29:56,401 --> 02:30:01,146
He said he'd die but
not touch your money.

1374
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:05,145
He Won't. That's Why doctor said...

1375
02:30:05,300 --> 02:30:09,942
Even if he hasn't Won
the lottery, just say it.

1376
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:12,604
You mean he hasn't Won the lottery?

1377
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:16,247
No. You may tear this.

1378
02:30:17,833 --> 02:30:20,404
Meaning you're giving 250000?

1379
02:30:22,133 --> 02:30:25,046
Say yes.
Yes.

1380
02:30:25,434 --> 02:30:28,938
He agreed to pay 250000!

1381
02:30:29,434 --> 02:30:31,607
Not for 250000!

1382
02:30:32,234 --> 02:30:35,579
No, just 125000!

1383
02:30:35,934 --> 02:30:40,849
- 125000 not 250000!

1384
02:30:47,201 --> 02:30:50,080
He has gone up to meet you.

1385
02:30:55,134 --> 02:30:57,774
My name. You never asked.

1386
02:30:59,233 --> 02:31:01,543
Friends should be addressed
by their first names.

1387
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,308
Mother !

1388
02:31:14,767 --> 02:31:17,077
Everything turned out fine.

1389
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:24,404
You'll be fine.

1390
02:31:24,567 --> 02:31:26,569
I am already better.

1391
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:31,446
The mother Whose kids
are happy, her life is made.

1392
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:35,079
See what I brought for you.

1393
02:31:37,601 --> 02:31:41,276
Neha is Waiting for you.

1394
02:31:57,733 --> 02:31:59,679
Where had you gone?

1395
02:32:00,101 --> 02:32:03,105
Always near you.

1396
02:32:03,367 --> 02:32:09,807
Since We were separated...
We'll never be separated.

1397
02:32:12,667 --> 02:32:17,878
We'll always be together.

1398
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:27,710
Like Water and the lake,
rain and the umbrella.

1399
02:32:30,467 --> 02:32:32,378
Flower...
