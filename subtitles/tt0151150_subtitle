1
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,996
Goa 1958.

2
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,730
India attained freedom in 1947.

3
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,997
But Goa was under
Portuguese rule till 1961.

4
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,875
This is a city of Goa, Vasco.

5
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,922
And this is Alberto Vasco.

6
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,451
He owns the maximum land here.

7
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,460
In a way, he is the king.

8
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,555
That is why this city
is named after him.

9
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,630
And his statue is put
up in the central square.

10
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,907
Before him, nobody
had been honored thus.

11
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,579
That day, the scene was festive.

12
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,948
All the towns folk had gathered.

13
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,712
Everyone was cheerful.

14
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,611
They were congratulating
him with heart felt wishes.

15
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,489
Except for one woman.

16
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,393
You pig!!

17
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,266
What do you think of yourself?
May worms feed on your body!

18
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,536
Nobody will give you a
sip of water when you die!

19
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,520
Forget it. We are not
Togo into that area!

20
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,355
I'll see you!

21
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,629
This is the statue of Alberto
Vasco, the biggest land owner.

22
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,905
He owned more than half the city.

23
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,238
That is how this city was named Vasco.

24
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,570
When the Portuguese
left Goa 20 years ago...

25
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,914
These big land lords left
their property behind.

26
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,612
They grabbed everything,
but it's good for us.

27
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,616
You'll get the kind of place you want.

28
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,492
Because there's no real owner.

29
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,455
Driver, stop the car.

30
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:07,860
I want that house.

31
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,631
- For the company guest house.
- Sure. You'll get it.

32
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,878
Bihari, stop these hoodlums!
Why are they breaking my house?

33
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,210
Does the house become
yours if you encroach on it?

34
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:29,386
You are the tenant. Sign here and
you'll get 5000 or you get nothing.

35
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,291
All right.

36
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,557
I'll meet you at the shop.

37
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,298
Your stool, uncle.

38
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,497
He went there to steal
and the Eagles beat him up!

39
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,501
Idiot! Come on.

40
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,855
Jojo! Run!

41
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,684
The Bichhus (Scorpions)
Have come to thrash us!

42
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,354
Come on, Michael.

43
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,466
Hey you dog!

44
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,836
Didn't I say, you guys
must not step into our area?

45
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,875
A dozen of you have ensconced
yourselves here for 2 years.

46
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,546
Since then Vascohas had problems.

47
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,926
Before that, you Christians
did the ball dance here!

48
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,591
Hey pig, have you forgotten
last time's thrashing?

49
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,595
You escaped because
Father Jacob intervened.

50
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,369
Remember what I said then?

51
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,364
This side of the ground is
ours and that side is yours.

52
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,206
Now you must live there, and die there.

53
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,276
Get the building sand
home son that side vacated.

54
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,414
Or I'll break your legs and
place them on your hands!

55
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,314
Do you think I'm easy meat?

56
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,953
Does your father own Vasco?

57
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,956
Why? Didn't your mother tell you?

58
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,006
We are in our spirits

59
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,620
So be in your senses

60
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,996
Don't you glare at us

61
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,996
Let's hear that again

62
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,040
We're in the spirits too

63
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,653
You had better be in your senses

64
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,356
Don't you give us those dirty looks...

65
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,628
What did you say? ...come again

66
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,085
I've come across several guys like you

67
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,354
Just tell us what you're getting at

68
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:12,364
Goa way; don't come here.
And don't mess with us

69
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,744
Go on, get lost... Stop
fibbing... we're not scared

70
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,988
You're ignorant. If you have the guts...

71
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,986
Come and face me...
- You have a fight!

72
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,387
What do you take me for?

73
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,004
What did you say? Come again

74
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:58,400
Beware... careful! You
had better be careful of us

75
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:07,278
Lay off! Keep away...
they're all scared of us

76
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,899
Stop making a noise. Come out
in the open, if you want a fight

77
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,066
- I'm alert...
- And ready

78
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,306
What are you worth?
Who the hell are you?

79
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,319
We are in the spirits...

80
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,486
Talk sense

81
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,261
We are in the spirits...
- So talk sense

82
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,869
Don't you glare at us

83
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,272
What did you say? Come again

84
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,302
Arrest all these boys!

85
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,576
Sir, what have I done? I was
just arm wrestling with brother.

86
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,903
Sir, I said I'd drop him to
Calangute on my mobike, isn't it?

87
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,947
Yes Sir, and I said I'd drop
him in my Mercedes tempo.

88
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,985
So... coming pal?

89
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,956
That is why we thought
we'd wrestle arms to decide.

90
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:06,261
See that, D'costa? Sometimes
they fight, sometimes they love...

91
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,127
They should have been married!

92
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,702
The mention of marriage
makes you laugh, huh?

93
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,536
Bichhu married to an Eagle. Where?

94
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,277
In prison!

95
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,916
Did these children fight again?

96
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,179
Children? These children?

97
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,288
Last week they broke 4 street
lights, the entire vegetable market...

98
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,223
And Rodriquez' new car.

99
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,730
I would handcuff them even in jail!

100
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,806
Why do you fight? Want to show
your strength to each other?

101
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,242
I know you are young, full of spirit.

102
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,951
Instead of breaking each others'
bones, make something of yourselves.

103
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,147
Live together like brothers.

104
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,651
Remember my words,
life is very precious.

105
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,587
Once this time is lost,
it will never return.

106
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:12,328
Remember my words.

107
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,869
Spare them this time. They are immature.

108
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,463
- They won't repeat this.
- You're making a mistake.

109
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,875
They are dangerous, not immature!

110
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,876
Yet I spare them for your sake.

111
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,850
Even if you pluck a leaf
from a tree, watch it!

112
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,887
Come on. Move!

113
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,886
Now all of you go away.

114
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,222
Get on with yourjobs.

115
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,403
- You got in to a fight again?
- No father, they started it!

116
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,405
The dogs!

117
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,909
But if they start a fight,
we can't keep quiet...

118
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,146
This blood shed will not help.

119
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,819
But they started it. We were just...

120
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,645
I want to see you in church.

121
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,857
- This Sunday?
- Every Sunday.

122
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,243
You come in last, yet
want to leave first.

123
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:13,213
It's Max' fault. It takes so long
to wake him up! He's still sleeping!

124
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,577
- There's a jam session in college on Saturday.
- So?

125
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,953
- Why?
- The Purple Riot Band has come from Bombay.

126
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,364
What happened?

127
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,470
Look at her hand!

128
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:14,973
May I read your palm?

129
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,413
You have a terrific life line!

130
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,019
And take a look at this love line...

131
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,994
Never seen one like this!

132
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,997
Solid!

133
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,330
What's his name?

134
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,510
Okay, I'll answer that.
Does his name begin with T?

135
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,712
- Dog! Want one?
- No!

136
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,089
No? Of course you'll want one!

137
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,923
- Yes!
- Then why did you say no?

138
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,962
Next time you flirt with my
sister, you'll get thrashed!

139
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,977
It's going to be twelve.
Let's meet the strike.

140
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,015
We must reach home
before the twelve gongs.

141
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,586
But you must only count the
gong. Don't tell me to turn.

142
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,995
- Careful!
- What are you doing?

143
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,949
- Look a head!
- Aunt, give way!

144
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,956
No problems now!

145
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,301
Leave her and turn right!

146
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,995
But why did you scream?

147
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,664
Who screamed? I...

148
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,675
- You tell him...
- No, you!

149
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,416
The brakes had failed.

150
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,457
But you didn't make it.

151
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,961
I'll go get my bike serviced.

152
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,463
The bike is fine. It was your mistake.

153
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,966
Why did you get involved with Rose Anne?

154
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,800
- Today is not a good day.
- Rubbish! It's very special.

155
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,631
What's special about today?

156
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,346
I'm sorry, I forgot.

157
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,384
What little sister? We were born
on the same day at the same time...

158
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,987
But I was born 15 seconds early.

159
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,207
Do you like it?

160
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,245
You made it yourself?

161
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,457
- It's not for this!
- But this fits best in it.

162
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,359
For me?

163
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,733
Whether Max remembers your
birthday or not, I will.

164
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,740
You remember it only because I too
was born on the same day, same time.

165
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,876
...5,6,7,8,9, 10.

166
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,378
One thousand and one.

167
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,916
Your fees for getting
the house evacuated.

168
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,576
You may keep the one buck.

169
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,581
Bihari, you are great!

170
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,390
It looks absolutely real!

171
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,898
Here's your share of
...10, 10 and 5.25000.

172
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,302
We do the threatening and breaking.

173
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,905
And this scoundrel,
Bihari reaps the rewards

174
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:45,908
I say to hell with Bihari.

175
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,912
Why don't we do direct
dealing with Chaudhary?

176
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:54,985
The idea is good but Bihari
forges the property papers.

177
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,611
Who will do the writing for us?

178
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,361
Little guy!

179
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,363
My brother!

180
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,868
You rogue! You've turned
stylish! Like a Bombayite!

181
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,201
But you are just the same.

182
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,704
Come on, Vasco is that way.

183
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,576
Mother! Come downstairs!
Rahul has come back!

184
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,224
Chottu, get the bags out.

185
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,903
He looks terrific!

186
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,904
Then what? Whose brother is he?

187
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,909
I've thought of a great plan for us.

188
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,901
- Me too.
- You say first.

189
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,347
We all will live in Bombay.

190
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,211
Life is great there.

191
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,853
Man's luck changes in a minute.

192
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,517
What is left in Vasco? Will
mother agree to come to Bombay?

193
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,861
The guys selling the caftan
made a fool out of you.

194
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,364
There's a hole in this.

195
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,198
Give it back to Rahul. He'll
return it. He's going back.

196
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,270
- You're going back?
- Not alone. All of us will go.

197
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,136
I'll open a big fast food restaurant.

198
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,139
Indian, foreign every style.

199
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,677
Mr. Shetty will put up the
capital and my training.

200
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,843
In a year, I'll take
you to the skies, mother!

201
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,512
I don't want to reach any
where. I will stay here.

202
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,889
- But mother, over there...
- You may go.

203
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,893
- Leave tomorrow itself.
- No, mother.

204
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,891
- I'm here for a month.
- Why are you wasting time?

205
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,563
You've seen the place.
You've fixed everything.

206
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,233
Why did you come here?
You could have written.

207
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,239
Pack this in his bag. Invest what
you get on returning it in your hotel.

208
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,144
Mother! Did you have
to tell her right now?

209
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,611
I'd have explained to her.
Now she is angry with me.

210
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,118
So? She saw you after two years.

211
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,548
You've been home for barely 5 hours
and you're talking of returning!

212
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,857
Pin head, see Vasco.

213
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,521
I am confident you won't leave it.

214
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,598
Rest tonight. I'll show you
the sights of Vasco tomorrow.

215
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,789
Come here. Sorry, I'm late.
Some important work cropped up.

216
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,954
This is my brother, Rahul.

217
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,967
He's very educated, a chef.
That means an English cook.

218
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,439
And these are my pals.
That is Lafdu. Chandu.

219
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,844
That is Chottu and Dasan.

220
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,609
And he's special, Bheja Fry.

221
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,919
Those two are the
newcomers, Dev and Pepsi.

222
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:22,652
Why are you smiling? Show
Rahul the sights of Vasco.

223
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,862
So Prakash is the boss
of the Bichhu gang?

224
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,265
Do you know from dogs and cats
to important men, salute him?

225
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:35,703
We saw Maria's house on the way?

226
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,870
He pays expenses to the guys who
for cibly live there, to evacuate it.

227
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,879
He'll thrash them...

228
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,916
so this is the business of Bicchu gang

229
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,954
In a while, everyone
will salute you too.

230
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,926
Don't call me a hood!

231
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,961
And there's no need to be my guide.

232
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,959
I'll see the place myself.

233
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,974
- Rahul!
- Sir!

234
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,977
- Don't go ahead.
- Why?

235
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,711
We're standing on the border line!

236
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,551
- What border?
- That side of the ground belongs to the eagles!

237
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,385
Eagle gang is the sworn
enemy of the Bichhu gang!

238
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,991
Nobody from that gang
can come to our area.

239
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,495
And our boys can't go there!

240
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,325
Not even by mistake!

241
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,330
Not by mistake. But
he can go on purpose.

242
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,505
You must not go ahead!

243
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:16,632
You are the princess of my dreams...

244
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,370
You put everything around to shade

245
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,370
So come and take my hand

246
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,907
You put everything around to shade...

247
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,956
Here she comes... bathed in roses

248
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,903
She brings the fragrance with her

249
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:49,392
It's your eyes... they're intoxicating

250
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:56,390
Your beauty, I behold

251
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:04,268
You are the Princess of my dreams...

252
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,270
You have put everything around to shade

253
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,913
Come and take my hand

254
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:03,256
It's magic... you have cast a spell

255
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,270
I can't control my heart anymore

256
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:32,889
Tell me at least so much,
O celestial beauty...

257
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:39,300
Where do you live?
And what is your name?

258
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:47,306
O Princess of my dreams...

259
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,346
You have put everything around to shade

260
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,350
So take my hand

261
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,744
I don't know you but I
felt like talking to you.

262
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,890
- Are you new to this place?
- Yes. I came on Friday.

263
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:40,896
My family is here for 2 years
but I was studying in Bombay.

264
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,900
This is the first time I've come to Goa.

265
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,231
It's a beautiful place.

266
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,907
Just a minute.

267
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,816
I thought it would be great if
somebody could show me around.

268
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,257
- My name is...
- What have you seen in Vasco?

269
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,865
The ground, the beach and the old fort

270
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,193
Have you seen Max?

271
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,372
What is that?

272
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:28,139
You must meet him. He'll
show you everything.

273
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,847
Lights at night, stars in the day...

274
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,247
You too will like him a lot.

275
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,727
He's a first rate scoundrel!

276
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,734
Why should we talk of that hood, Max?

277
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,343
Do you know why I've called you here?

278
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,106
For lunch.

279
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:08,851
- Then?
- For many days I've been wanting to say something.

280
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,857
Each time I see you,
my heart says something.

281
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,124
- What did you say?
- Not to you. There...

282
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,526
- There's nobody there.
- There isn't?

283
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,372
Do you know I met your Daddy?

284
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,602
- When?
- Two day ago.

285
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,376
He was buying brandy.

286
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,915
He was fighting for 3 bucks.

287
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,644
I looked at him and said...

288
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,955
You scoundrel! You've come here too!

289
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,356
- I didn't mean you.
- You meant my Daddy!

290
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,959
Not even your Daddy!

291
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,360
These hoods have come here!

292
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,231
- May I sit here?
- No, we're having a private lunch.

293
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:04,835
What have you ordered?

294
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,344
- Why are you abusing me?
- It's the name of the dish.

295
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,882
Then say so. What is added to it?

296
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,215
- What?
- It's a Chinese dish. It will have cock roaches.

297
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,922
No, I'll tell you its' ingredients.

298
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,918
It's got noodle sand chicken.

299
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,327
Prawns and a few carrots.

300
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,693
Capsicum and mushrooms...

301
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,366
But no cockroaches.

302
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,596
How does one eat it?

303
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,268
Chew it with your teeth.

304
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,601
- And how is the taste?
- Spicy.

305
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,876
A little sweet; a little spicy.

306
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,641
Must be a delicious, sweet feeling.

307
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,245
- Take it away and eat it!
- That's what I think.

308
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,452
- This...
- I thought you meant Rose.

309
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,249
I can't eat your lunch.

310
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,685
These days we're dieting.

311
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,460
- Yes. - You eat it.
- I don't want it.

312
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,957
- Eat it.
- I don't want it!

313
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,363
We're leaving.

314
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:17,412
Were you not here, I'd have beaten,
cut him and made Manchurian of him!

315
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,413
Eat quietly now.

316
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:26,385
How can I eat? I wanted to
tell you something special.

317
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,992
You are the largest part of my life...

318
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,655
Cockroach!

319
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,585
Hooligan! Max! Why are you after me?

320
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,453
Don't you know?

321
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,971
Rose Anne humiliated you
in front of Savo once again.

322
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:20,305
She loves me a lot but her
style of flirting is different.

323
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:28,448
I was in church and this boy
came and sat right next to me.

324
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,678
Right under Father's nose.

325
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,486
And said, this is the
first time I've come to Goa.

326
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,993
I wish somebody would take me
around Vasco town, etc, etc...

327
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,395
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

328
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:43,994
He was openly flirting.

329
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,002
Next time you see him, tell me.

330
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,915
So many potato chips?

331
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,920
I'll give you two box
full. Take them to Bombay.

332
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,954
And think of your mother there!

333
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,958
How about if I eat all
these chips right here?

334
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,289
What do you mean?

335
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,462
I mean, I have made a decision.

336
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:15,960
I won't go to Bombay.

337
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:21,970
- Really?
- Yes, I'll stay here. With you.

338
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,633
- I'll open a small shop here.
- That's great!

339
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,909
Are you happy, mother?
Don't worry about the shop.

340
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,347
I'll fix everything
tomorrow. Little guy!

341
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,281
You've won the jackpot, uncle!

342
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:40,386
My brother adores your
shop that's lying vacant.

343
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,319
I'll take it on rent.
I'll pay 500 a month.

344
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,995
Okay, I'll pay 600 but paint it.

345
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,497
I want 25000 as deposit.

346
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,001
And 5000 rent per month.
Talk if it's acceptable.

347
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:54,665
Are you giving the Taj?

348
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,005
Why are you interrupting?

349
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,410
- Give it happily or...
- Let me talk.

350
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:03,908
What do you want to say?

351
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,951
I'm just beginning. I
need your co-operation.

352
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,954
- If you...
- I see, I see everything!

353
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,754
He's threatening me from
there! Hooligan! Ruffian!

354
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,359
Old man! You think we're crazy?

355
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,787
Even pigeons don't lay
eggs in that ruin of yours!

356
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,966
If I don't go what will you
do, you land grabbing swindler?

357
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,465
He took the land when
his land lord died.

358
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,903
He's asking for 5000 when he
doesn't pay the rent himself!

359
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,498
You bald!

360
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,638
Call amidi or a bell-bottom!

361
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:37,776
- Call anybody...
- Brother, let go!

362
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,448
I'll see who comes to your help!

363
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,001
Let go of uncle.

364
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,871
Should I hold you?

365
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,960
Let go or I'll chop you right here!

366
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,401
I say, leave him! Let go!

367
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,606
Why did you interfere?
I'd have dealt with Max!

368
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,950
Mother is right, you are out of hand!

369
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:49,613
The shop is our of our hands.

370
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,679
Would your fisticuffs
have got it for us?

371
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,489
- Of course!
- That is how we have to set tenants right.

372
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,821
You being a gentleman
won't working this business.

373
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,994
Then what will work?
Bichhu's gang hooliganism?

374
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:05,531
That's not true. We deal
with business like business.

375
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,266
We never create fights for no reason.

376
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:16,912
- They came to talk of marriage...
- Your brother is like that...

377
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,916
- I'm scared of him.
- You dog! Cad!

378
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,743
- Flirting in my area!
- Help!

379
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,953
Teasing girls in our area!

380
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,285
You rotten Eagle!

381
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,403
Prakash! Let go!

382
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:45,903
Leave him!

383
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,910
That bastard Eagle was
flirting with one of our girls!

384
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,610
Stop it! I don't want to hear anything!

385
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,128
Prakash has sent us.

386
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,198
He apologizes.

387
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,875
Why are you quiet? You should apologize.

388
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,878
You cut the noses of Bichhu
gang in front of the Eagles!

389
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,414
Look, you are new here.

390
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,507
You don't know the problems here.

391
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,511
It's good he thrashed that Eagle.

392
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,287
Had I been there, I'd
have castrated him!

393
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:42,559
If anyone even looks at Max's
sister, Shirley, he blinds him!

394
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,901
Is Shirley, Max' sister?

395
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:48,394
Twin! She's his twin sister!

396
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,566
How can we spare anyone who
takes a girl from our area out?

397
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:57,272
We've come here because Prakash
is the leader of Bichhu gang.

398
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,538
He's standing there.

399
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,353
Go and meet him.

400
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,482
He may be your boss.

401
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,191
He's my brother. Don't
teach me what I must do!

402
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:20,528
- She's coming!
- Butterfly, where are you going?

403
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,876
My rain cloud. Shower on me!

404
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,848
Spare me a glance...

405
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,847
Rent of 1000 bucks and zero deposit.

406
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,891
Ajob can be done
without spending money.

407
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:51,561
I give up, man! You're really
smart! Lafdu, take this.

408
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,565
Do you forgive me?

409
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,772
On one condition.

410
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:07,316
Only if you give up fighting
and help me in setting my shop.

411
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,820
Is that all? Then listen...

412
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,254
You're with Rahul from today.

413
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,519
- And you?
- I am with you.

414
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,259
What guys?

415
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,525
Will you do it or not?

416
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,873
You've said it. Assume it done.

417
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,628
Having a fancy name won't
make the cakes sweeter?

418
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,870
Look at that Bichhu entering
our area unflinchingly!

419
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,272
Yes, Prakash's brother. Come on!

420
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:47,745
You Bichhu's don't get
visa to come to our area.

421
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:51,248
- Don't you know?
- Answer him!

422
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,581
He forgot the answer and the road.

423
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,691
I have to deliver this
cake there. Make way for me.

424
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,963
Else what will you do? Beat us?
Show us some punch, fair villager!

425
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:13,236
This Captain Cook can only show
examples of cake and pastries.

426
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:17,741
The baboon! Just watch
how the coward will flee!

427
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,778
Those who run away are cowards.

428
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:25,053
But those fighting for
no reason are not valiant.

429
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:26,917
They are fools.

430
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,391
What man?

431
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:36,395
Do you have to deliver the
cake with your own hands?

432
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,994
But if you don't have hands?

433
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:48,009
Now get out fast or your handstand
legs will be here and the body there.

434
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,546
What border? I don't see any border.

435
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:57,382
You'll see it. You will
see it before you go blind!

436
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,953
What is this? Sold just
one biscuit all day?

437
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:09,294
Keep this on your nose and draw a
border line pushing it to the ground.

438
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,364
There...

439
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,971
Come on! You cook boy!

440
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,997
I'd kept it for a beggar.

441
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,406
You may each take 5paise.

442
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,339
You dog!

443
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:00,914
What a collar!

444
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,952
Not a sign of dirt.

445
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,921
Do you get an imported
washer man to wash it?

446
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,582
What is going on?

447
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,552
We were discussing laundering.

448
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,294
Laundering shirts or him?

449
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,628
What were they telling you?

450
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,471
- Showing me the way.
- Then?

451
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,475
The wrong path. I was going right.

452
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:31,942
Get on with your work.

453
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,676
Come with me.

454
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,281
We were doing our work.
You came and spoilt matters.

455
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,991
Come on guys. What was the score?

456
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,005
Do you like my new car?

457
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,997
It's nice but look ahead and drive.

458
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,353
Quiet...

459
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:21,360
My bike is new. Pinch me.

460
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,364
- Get lost!
- Give you a shove?

461
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:28,894
My car is new.

462
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,735
Much faster than your bullock cart!

463
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,307
Savo is throwing you a challenge.

464
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,778
No, it's not fair.

465
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,949
My bike, his jalopy.

466
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,347
I'm a man and Savo...

467
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,652
We'll have a race.

468
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,497
Forget it. If you
race I'll get off here.

469
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,397
It's a matter of my honor!

470
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,364
...which I'm going to plunder.

471
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:34,630
Don't you just love
to fool simple people?

472
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,234
You too fool him.

473
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,568
You love me but go out with him.

474
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,411
Someday God will punish you!

475
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,609
What happened?

476
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,449
God turned into an ant and bit me!

477
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:54,613
Come with me. Why are
you playing hard to get?

478
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,719
To how many girls have you said this?

479
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,391
Only you, Sandra.

480
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,959
Only to you, Rose Anne, My love.

481
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,888
I said, you are my Juliet

482
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:35,891
And she said... you're fibbing!

483
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:40,563
Why does she think I'm lying
whenever I speak the truth?!

484
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:46,307
That must be her style... she
must be consenting at heart

485
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:56,278
She'll soon say she loves
you... why are you worried?

486
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:39,888
I suggest, you invite her...
and treat her to lunch in a hotel

487
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:45,398
Take her to the sea-shore
and just pop the question

488
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:50,299
I did invite her... and
treated her to the sour-soup

489
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:55,300
I found an opportunity and went
for it... I told her everything

490
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,941
What did you tell her?

491
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:03,215
I said, you're my Juliet. And she...
- She said you're lying

492
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,653
Why does she think I'm lying
whenever I speak the truth?

493
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:14,256
That must be her style...
She must be willing at heart

494
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:24,167
She'll come around one of these
days... why are you worried?

495
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:10,215
I've dealt with so many
problems... yours is different

496
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:15,254
You're through with everything...
yet, where's the hitch?

497
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:24,256
Elope with her... if
she knows what you want

498
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:29,268
I went to elope with her
in the middle of the night

499
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:31,364
Was that really set up?

500
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,882
So that was your Eagle brother, Max.

501
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,418
Quite a specimen.

502
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,613
Did you like him?

503
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,891
Why don't you join him for tea?

504
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:28,463
Do you cycle to college daily?

505
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,130
No, I go with Max on his bike.

506
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,268
Why don't you come with us, triple seat?

507
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,203
Do you think I fear Max?

508
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,706
Why should I fear him?

509
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:45,241
Because he wears a leatherjacket?

510
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,244
And rings in his ears?

511
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,247
Rides a bike and considers
himself the local thug?

512
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,955
That's stupid it not bravery.

513
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,958
Maybe he scares kids not me.

514
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,694
What do you study?

515
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,975
I've done a course in Hotel Management.

516
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,015
Why don't you come to my
shop? I make wonderful cakes.

517
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,336
Why would I fear Maxi?
I am this and that...

518
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,666
if you're so brave,
meet me in front of Maxi.

519
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,009
All right. Want to bet?

520
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:54,874
But if I win, you have to kiss me.

521
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,087
If you have a face left.

522
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,598
So I win!

523
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,370
When will I get my prize?

524
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,139
Will you help me shop?

525
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:20,505
Give me two melons.

526
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:27,352
I must admit, you were great that day.

527
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:30,389
- You're very brave!
- I told you so.

528
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,890
- I'm not scared of Max.
- But I was scared.

529
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:36,559
When Max looked at
you, for a second, I...

530
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,561
I was really scared!

531
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,902
- For me?
- Are you okay?

532
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:44,404
Scared for me?

533
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:49,307
I don't know why... I
never felt like this before.

534
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,274
What did you feel?

535
01:05:57,086 --> 01:06:00,385
I have to make fruit salad today.

536
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,257
You said you never
felt like this before.

537
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,523
- What did you feel?
- Yes, that's it.

538
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:15,267
Possibly... I felt...

539
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,201
Asif...

540
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,273
Asif?

541
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,452
We're home.

542
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:33,887
And my prize?

543
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,553
Won't you come in?

544
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,223
Maxi is not home.

545
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:47,901
What a beautiful house!

546
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,946
Now I'll give you your prize.

547
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:02,074
Now it's notjust the
prize. Much more than that.

548
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,854
This is proof that you love me.

549
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,531
That's the prize for cheaters!

550
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,172
Anyone can wear a mask and win a bet.

551
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,345
Sorry, you lose.

552
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,680
Thanks for carrying
so many fruits for me.

553
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,458
Where are you going?

554
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,897
Max I will soon be home. Looks
like you want to get beaten!

555
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,231
- No, I want to feed him.
- What?

556
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,432
He'll make a fruit
salad out of you, Romeo!

557
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,538
- And you'll enjoy it.
- Sure.

558
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:05,803
So enjoy it. Do you have lime?

559
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,816
No but we have a first aid box. Want it?

560
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:16,415
You'll know when he breaks your bones.

561
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:20,190
- Then don't tell me.
- I won't.

562
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:42,916
I say... Maxi is here...

563
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,861
- What?
- What?

564
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,867
What, what? My bike...

565
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,371
I just got it painted.

566
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,573
Looks like such a beauty!

567
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,178
I'll take you for a ride. Let's go.

568
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:52,953
- Not now...
- Why not? Come on.

569
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:54,922
- I have lots of work.
- Forget it, come on!

570
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:57,351
- I don't want to come!
- Don't want to come?

571
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:07,467
Don't take it to heart.

572
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:15,634
I'll come with you tomorrow.

573
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:22,845
I made it, specially for you.

574
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,745
Like it?

575
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,324
What was that sound?

576
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,322
Sound? No.

577
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,999
There was. Where?

578
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:40,663
Outside...

579
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:44,504
No, in here.

580
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:07,961
Who locked you in? Shirley?

581
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:14,467
You don't want to
come? I'll take Maggie.

582
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,001
It will be great fun when Max returns!

583
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,524
The pastry is no good today.

584
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,358
Then go to the shop in
front! Why do you come here?

585
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,624
Where is aunt?

586
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,794
Go to Treat House.

587
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,629
Hurry up! We have a big contract.

588
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,635
Hence forth this contract
will always come to us.

589
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:31,274
He takes away my contract
and then gloats over it!

590
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,947
- What's the matter?
- I know everything!

591
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,941
This is that rascal Prakash' trick!

592
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,953
He grabbed the Goa Liberation
Day contract under threats.

593
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,557
But one mustn't use force.

594
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:47,995
You just tell me, I'll break the
cad's legs and hang them in your shop!

595
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:51,489
What will I do with his
leg? I want the contract!

596
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,001
I'm a God fearing man.

597
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,956
Shall I get my tempo tomorrow?

598
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,788
No, Mr. Mascaren has will
collect his order personally.

599
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,289
Need anything else?

600
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,690
Nothing. Carry on.

601
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,651
I want to place a special order.

602
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,266
It should have 7 colors.

603
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,873
Red, blue, pink.

604
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,911
Green, black and white.

605
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,313
There should be no yellow.

606
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,910
There should be no yellow.

607
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:31,226
...should be there.

608
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,558
Should be there.

609
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,734
Write on that...

610
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,346
And keep in mind...

611
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,870
Have we stopped accepting advance?

612
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:14,138
One has to adjust
depending on the customer.

613
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,376
Come on, we have enough work.

614
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,643
8 o'clock tomorrow.

615
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,945
I hope the chloro form wasn't too much.

616
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,939
Or they'll sleep till morning.

617
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,484
This is the job of an expert.

618
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,607
But why did you change the name?

619
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,185
Come in, sir.

620
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:27,525
Please listen to me.

621
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:29,197
What a tiny shop!

622
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:32,371
Full of rats!

623
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:36,535
- You cheated me!
- Sir, listen to me.

624
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:39,503
- What to listen? -
I'll do something. - What?

625
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:40,909
What's wrong?
