1
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:09,289
Move aside.

2
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:10,937
Careful. Watch out.

3
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:18,867
Bravo, my child! That's it.
That's it. Get down, Son.

4
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:31,451
Hello.
- Hello, Accountant.

5
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,799
Hurry up, we may miss
the auspicious hour.

6
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,439
How come?

7
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:40,317
l've toiled to my bones for this.
My stars won't ever let me down.

8
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:44,544
Now, even their stars
have mingled with mine.

9
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:49,568
All share the same
date of the same month.

10
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,710
Wonderful.

11
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,243
They've proved to be
very lucky for you.

12
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,255
Your business has increased
by leaps and bounds.

13
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,974
Your business
increased by four folds.

14
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,913
Thus, l'm opening this
new shop on their birthday.

15
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,455
Very nice.
- Congratulations.

16
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:06,389
Come on, Kids.

17
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,696
Congratulations.

18
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,959
Congratulations.

19
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:42,847
Oh, my pal.
- Congratulations, dear.

20
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:48,484
You've put up a new board?

21
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:52,401
Since l bought the shop next door,
l thought l'd put up one long board.

22
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:55,805
l've added my sons' names too.

23
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:58,855
Lala Kedarnath And Sons.

24
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:01,013
Wonderful.

25
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,960
Coming to the party in
the evening, l hope.

26
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:04,311
But of course.

27
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,453
Don't forget.
- lt is not a matter to forget.

28
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,738
Dharamvir, my pal. Have some.

29
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:48,028
Mr. Khan, have some.
Don't be so formal.

30
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:51,722
Okay, but what about singing?

31
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,105
We'll have that too.

32
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:56,710
You'll have to sing however.
- Yes. - No, l can't..

33
00:05:56,848 --> 00:06:02,559
That's all behind me. l'm old now.
- You may be, but we're not. Sing..

34
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,109
Don't create a fuss now.

35
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:05,671
Sister-in-law.

36
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:09,115
Yes?

37
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:14,451
Your husband is old now. But
we'll make him young again.

38
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,138
ls that so? With her before me,
l'll be youngest among the young.

39
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:23,796
Listen.

40
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:12,121
''Oh, my beautiful beloved,
you don't know it..

41
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:14,441
..but you're still so lovely.''

42
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:21,145
''And l'm still so young, that,
l'd lay down my life for you.''

43
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:25,606
''Oh, my beautiful beloved,
you don't know it..

44
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,602
..but you're still so lovely.''

45
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:34,212
''And l'm still so young, that,
l'd lay down my life for you.''

46
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:04,251
''This coyness and smartness
that you have in you, is unique.''

47
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:11,766
''This coyness and smartness
that you have in you, is unique.''

48
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:19,027
''The art of winning hearts
that's in you, is unique too.''

49
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:24,591
''l found my heaven and
earth in your eyes.''

50
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,678
''l found my heaven and
earth in your eyes.''

51
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:33,861
''Oh, my beloved beauty,
you don't know it..

52
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:36,075
..but you're still so lovely.''

53
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:42,760
''And l'm still so very
young that l'd die for you.''

54
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:12,147
''When you smile and say
something sweet to me..''

55
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:19,567
''When you smile and say
something sweet to me..''

56
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:28,062
''lt sends my blood racing
even today. My darling..''

57
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:32,659
''My dear darling, l'm
still in love with you.''

58
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:37,587
''My dear darling, l'm
still in love with you.''

59
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:41,637
''Oh, my beloved beauty,
you don't know it..

60
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,671
..but you're still so lovely.''

61
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:50,156
''And l'm still so young, that
l'd die for you most gladly.''

62
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:53,944
''Oh, my beloved beauty,
you don't know it..

63
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,235
..but you're still so lovely.''

64
00:09:56,354 --> 00:10:02,827
''And l'm still so young, that
l'd die for you most gladly.''

65
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:06,912
Wonderful.

66
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:18,365
Wonderful.

67
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:24,051
Congrats, dear friend.
- Welcome.

68
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:28,733
You are most unlucky.
- Why?

69
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:36,168
Towards the end of the party,
he sang a lovely love-song.

70
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,850
But you got to enjoy it, didn't you?

71
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,688
Sorry, but he was to come..

72
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:51,304
So, l went to pick him up.
Sir, this is Lala Kedarnath..

73
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:56,678
..the pride of our city.
And this is Pandit Uday Shankar..

74
00:10:56,814 --> 00:11:02,286
..a great astrologer. He wasn't
coming, but l dragged him here.

75
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,890
But of course. Thank you
for coming. Please be seated.

76
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:07,012
Thank you.
- Have a seat.

77
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:11,862
Where are your sons?
- Must be around here.

78
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,856
Come here, Princes.

79
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:21,441
Come here, Princes.

80
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:27,440
Come, my dear children.
Sit down here.

81
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:31,775
How are you, dear?
Oh. l nearly forgot.

82
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:36,354
Take this.

83
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:40,361
Take this, dear. My sweet baby.

84
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:49,063
The funniest thing is that these
boys share the same birth date.

85
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,142
Foretell their future.
- Go on.

86
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,248
You know, l don't believe in it.

87
00:11:54,872 --> 00:12:01,061
Today, l'll convince you.
Show your hand to him. Go on.

88
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:04,756
Okay, see it, Pandit. See it.

89
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:13,037
You've led a very hard life before.

90
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:25,083
l would carry flour-sacks on my
back as a youngster. Right, friends?

91
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:26,225
Absolutely right.

92
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,316
And it's not written on my hand,
but etched on my back. Look.

93
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,842
Tell me, what do you have to say?

94
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:41,159
There must've been
other men with you too.

95
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:47,453
Why haven't they made it big?
- Shirkers all. Hard work pays well.

96
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:52,391
Fortune is not in one's palms,
but in one's biceps.

97
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,163
Man can make not just his own
future, but of others too. Anyway.

98
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:03,205
What my sons will become,
l'll tell you today.

99
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:08,307
Come on, boys.

100
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:15,839
This is Raju my eldest son.
l'll make him a barrister.

101
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:20,560
Babloo here, being a bit
duffer like me, will run my shop.

102
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:26,428
And my darling Munnu will be
an engineer and go abroad.

103
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:29,829
And even if they don't
achieve all this, never mind.

104
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:32,338
A long as l'm around,
they need not worry about anything.

105
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:37,534
One can't really say what
''time'' will force a man to do.

106
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:43,915
At times, there's money to burn,
yet a man begs for his next meal.

107
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:48,599
Who has seen Mr. Time, Sir? l've
seen man, and l believe in him.

108
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:53,599
Man is great, no doubt.
But he's helpless at times.

109
00:13:56,093 --> 00:14:02,487
One lifts a cup to drink tea.
The cup and the lips are quite near.

110
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:09,934
But there's many a slip between.
- Come on, sir.

111
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:18,117
l drank the tea. Now, where's the
so-called 'slip'? Right, friends?

112
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,270
Okay, we shall leave now.

113
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:42,232
''Oh, my beloved beauty,
you don't know it..

114
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,238
..but you're still so lovely.''

115
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:50,530
''And l'm still so young, that
l'd die for you most gladly.''

116
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:55,900
When God created this world,
He couldn't have been as happy..

117
00:14:56,053 --> 00:15:00,080
..as l am in this house.

118
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:08,225
Watch what l do next year.
l'll build a palatial house for you.

119
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:12,456
And buy a sleek, grand car.

120
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:17,937
When you, me and
our princes go out..

121
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:24,071
..for a ride in it, people
will say, ''There goes Kedarnath.''

122
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:19,318
Father.

123
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,666
Father.

124
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,351
Father.

125
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,347
Father.

126
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:33,138
Laxmi.

127
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,353
Laxmi.

128
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:36,742
Laxmi.

129
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:41,031
What happened?

130
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,613
Laxmi, wait, l am coming.

131
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:33,098
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

132
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:36,350
You idiot.

133
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,553
Hey, what are you doing there?
Get down, l say.

134
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:47,463
Enough. Take them away.
ldiots. Come on..

135
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:51,300
Come on. Come on.

136
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:19,453
Have you seen my husband?
l didn't find him anywhere.

137
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,133
You've been asking me for days now..

138
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,490
..if he was here,
you'd have found him.

139
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,594
Oh, my God.

140
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:33,276
l'm looking for my husband.
Seen him anywhere?

141
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:37,166
Yes. l have.
- Where? Take me to him.

142
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:39,538
l'll be very grateful.
- Take you where?

143
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:42,225
We won't meet him now.
- What?

144
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:46,134
Where's he now?
- l saw an iron beam fall on him.

145
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:53,210
Mummy.
- Go to sleep, Son.

146
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:59,795
He woke up from his sleep.
- He must've wandered for days.

147
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:07,734
Seems from a good home.
- He's so sweet. l really think..

148
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:11,540
God sent him to me
to make me a mother.

149
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,894
How you pined for a child.
But the one who lost him..

150
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:18,882
lmagine her torment.

151
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,436
Shut up.

152
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:55,278
Stop it. Quiet, l say.

153
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:07,700
Fool! What are you
staring at? Start eating.

154
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:09,627
l don't like this food.

155
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,918
Then what shall l order for you?
Some delicious, yummy snacks?

156
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:19,318
Whoever comes here,
thinks himself to be a prince.

157
00:20:19,643 --> 00:20:23,306
Now that you get a
full meal, you fuss?

158
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,684
We get all the stuff,
and you eat good food.

159
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:28,319
You wag your tongue at me?

160
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:31,637
You idiot. Your father
must've fed you dry gram.

161
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:32,938
Don't take his name.

162
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:37,926
He had servants like you at home.
- Blast you. You dare do this?

163
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:40,386
Catches me by the throat.
Answers me back?

164
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,988
You idiot, stupid, fool.

165
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,661
He'll not get food for two days..

166
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:51,673
..and sweep this floor
at night, alone.

167
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:53,598
You idiot.

168
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:54,011
''Once, where there was happiness..''

169
00:20:54,011 --> 00:21:01,008
''Once, where there was happiness..''

170
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:09,369
''..now resides woe and sadness.''

171
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:16,616
''Time which had brought spring..''

172
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:23,554
''..has now brought drought.''

173
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:44,643
''Day-night. Yesterday and today..''

174
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:49,068
''Every man is a slave to time.''

''Every man is a slave to time.''

178
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:10,385
''Every man is bound to it..''

179
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,946
You fool.

180
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:22,885
''Even the sun and the moon
move according to the time.''

181
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:33,514
''Even the sun and the moon
move according to the time.''

182
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:42,048

00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:16,154
''There's time limit
even on good times.''

188
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:26,153
''There's time limit
even on good times.''

''Man should respect and fear time.''

195
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:19,033
''Man should respect and fear time.''

196
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:27,554
''For who knows when time
will change its mood?''

197
00:24:27,691 --> 00:24:31,559
''Time will change its mood?''

198
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:39,848

''Every one is bound to it.''

201
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:56,022
ldiot! Are you massaging, or
boot polishing? Puny hands.

202
00:24:56,153 --> 00:25:02,149
Eats like a goat, this as a rake.
Crack those toe-joints. Go on.

203
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,919
Greetings.

204
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:14,865
l want to see the manager.
- That's me. Get lost, idiot.

205
00:25:20,277 --> 00:25:24,589
You all go now. Yes?

206
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:29,532
This unfortunate man is Kedarnath.

207
00:25:29,686 --> 00:25:33,235
The earthquake literally
uprooted me.

208
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:40,860
lt ruined me. l lost my wife,
children. Everyone.

209
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:47,818
God knows l've gone everywhere.
Thought, in your..

210
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:50,758
The photos of the kids here,
are all in this register.

211
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:52,730
Give me, let me see.
- Here, see it for yourself.

212
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:13,182
This is my son. Tell him his
papa is here. Else l'll go myself.

213
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,718
Show me his room.
- Go, boy.

214
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:22,862
This is his room.

215
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:32,914
But he's not here.
- Have you seen Raju?

216
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,200
You mean the one
the manager thrashed?

217
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:37,343
He ran away.
- Fools.

218
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:40,257
What nonsense! Go find him.
Must be here somewhere.

219
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:43,637
Honestly, sir. He ran away.

220
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,627
Ask Ratan.
- Yes. Last night.

221
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:49,789
Said, ''l refuse to stay here.
The manager's always beating me.''

222
00:26:52,302 --> 00:26:56,295
You beat him? You hit my son?

223
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,988
Lousy man.
- Mind your tongue.

224
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,381
Why did you hit my son?

225
00:27:05,782 --> 00:27:07,647
You'll have to get him back for me.

226
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:10,235
You'll have to get him back for me.

227
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:12,651
Tell me where he is. Why
don't you say something?

228
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:40,932
Surround the house.

229
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:48,805
You, lnspector? Here, at
this time? Anything the matter?

230
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,297
Mr. Mittal's house was burgled.

231
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:56,152
You mean that judge?
- Yes.

232
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:58,443
He had bought a diamond
necklace for his daughter.

233
00:28:59,162 --> 00:29:00,311
Has he a daughter?

234
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:05,093
An only daughter. She had won
the ''Ms. Bombay'' title last year.

235
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:07,135
Yes. - She stood first
in the beauty contest.

236
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:09,769
ls she so beautiful?
- Yes.

237
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:13,171
Her necklace was stolen,
and the thief ran towards here.

238
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:17,861
Very smart to have stolen a
necklace of a lovely girl.

239
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,443
And that too before a special event.

240
00:29:19,916 --> 00:29:20,905
lt's her birthday tomorrow.

241
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:23,519
Really?
- Yes.

242
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:36,516
''Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you..''

243
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,476
Happy birthday, dear Meena.
Happy birthday to you..''

244
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:48,794
Thank you. Thank you.

245
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:52,210
Happy birthday, Meena.
- Thank you.

246
00:29:52,349 --> 00:29:55,216
Happy birthday, Meena.
- Thank you.

247
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:57,032
Happy birthday, Meena.
- Thank you.

248
00:29:57,454 --> 00:30:01,083
Your necklace, Happy Birthday.

249
00:30:05,228 --> 00:30:09,301
This necklace.. And you are..

250
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,849
l'm Raja. l never met you, but..

251
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,235
..your father knows me very well.

252
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:19,080
Oh. Father.

253
00:30:20,243 --> 00:30:21,232
Excuse me.

254
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:23,959
Hello, Mr. Raja.

255
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,393
l'm an uninvited guest,
but still, happy birthday.

256
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,539
This necklace..

257
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:32,134
How did you get it?
- He gave it to me.

258
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,330
lt's a present from a thief.

259
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:40,142
Last night, your house was burgled.

260
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,852
The thief ran in my house,
and while climbing..

261
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:45,945
..dropped this necklace.

262
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:51,552
When the servant brought it to me,
l thought l'd give it to the police.

263
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,864
But then, why should l
deprive you of your joy?

264
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:57,615
l'm very thankful.

265
00:30:58,014 --> 00:31:02,963
You've doubled our joy today.
You haven't met Meena, have you?

266
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:05,629
Not officially.
- l'll do it.

267
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:07,472
This is my daughter Meena.

268
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:09,569
lt's her 1 9th birthday today.

269
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:12,275
Congratulations. - Thank you.
- And he is Mr. Raja.

270
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:14,415
And as his name suggests,
he's a king at heart too.

271
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,637
Sir, a call for you.

272
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:23,094
Excuse me.

273
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:29,127
Let me put it on for you.

274
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,639
Thank you.

275
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:41,260
lt's Meena's
birthday today. Thank you.

276
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,672
lf Ravi has done his L.L.B.,
send him to me.

277
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:48,929
Mr. Patel is a renowned lawyer
here and a very good friend of mine.

278
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:55,237
l'll keep Ravi with him.
- What? At Mr. Patel's? Okay.

279
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:59,351
l'm thinking the same. And listen..

280
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:07,629
That bungalow on Malabar Hill,
have it cleaned by someone.

281
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:14,014
Okay, but listen, Ravi will
stay with me, not there. Yes.

282
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:16,302
And Mr. Scrooge, when will you
give a party because..

283
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:17,448
..Ravi cleared the exams?

284
00:32:17,594 --> 00:32:24,022
l'm giving a party for that
right now. We're having fun.

285
00:32:25,101 --> 00:32:30,050
Had you been here, it would have
been even better. l'll hang up now.

286
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,710
Bye, bye.
- Daddy.

287
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:37,694
Why phone him? You talk so loudly,
he'd have heard you there anyway.

288
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,071
Has Ravi come?
- No, not yet.

289
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,353
An odd kid. Where does he go?

290
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:55,991
Just see whether
we've hooked anything.

291
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:01,347
This fish is a headache.
lt's so near, yet so far.

292
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,331
l think it's having a go at my hook.

293
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:07,465
Friend..

294
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,350
lf it's a big one,
we'll have a party.

295
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:13,745
Party. l've had it.
- Hey.. Listen..

296
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,457
There's a party on,
and he's missing.

297
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:19,430
Let him come, and
see how l fire him.

298
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:25,493
Uncle, you're not eating anything.

299
00:33:25,662 --> 00:33:27,368
Since you've given it, l'll eat it.

300
00:33:27,697 --> 00:33:32,088
Why are you just sitting?
Come on, start eating.

301
00:33:34,437 --> 00:33:35,426
Eat. Eat.

302
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:40,671
You've left your plate untouched,
and you're chain-smoking.

303
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,631
lf you won't eat, l'll fight with
you. - l'll eat it up, don't worry.

304
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,364
lf you eat this because l have
given it to you, you'll go mad.

305
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:48,506
Oh, thank you.

306
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:54,556
Dad, if you don't eat anything, how
will the guests eat? Have something.

307
00:33:55,258 --> 00:33:57,078
Please. Thank you, Father.

308
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,808
Where were you, sir?
- Here.

309
00:34:02,198 --> 00:34:04,587
l didn't go anywhere.
l was looking after the guests.

310
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:08,250
You're doing pretty well too. Re..

311
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:10,396
Did she say anything? l'll call her.

312
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,121
Renu. Come here.

313
00:34:13,476 --> 00:34:15,626
Did you do it again?
- l..

314
00:34:15,745 --> 00:34:17,565
l've told you not to lie.
- But l..

315
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:20,137
lf you lie again, l'll..

316
00:34:20,283 --> 00:34:23,150
Listen to me..
- Never mind. l forgive you.

317
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:24,275
You are a very sweet girl.

318
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,409
See dad?

319
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:29,690
Mr. Khan. Are you coming now?
- l got held up.

320
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:33,728
Sir, no mangoes this year?
- We didn't have any.

321
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:35,637
Never mind. Next year.
Please be comfortable.

322
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:47,165
Mother.

323
00:34:47,443 --> 00:34:49,832
What's this?
- Where were you?

324
00:34:50,246 --> 00:34:51,588
Your dad was getting angry.

325
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,706
But you weren't angry, were you?
- How can l be?

326
00:34:55,251 --> 00:35:00,120
You're our sunshine. This has
been a happy home since you've come.

327
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:01,245
Oh, Mother.

328
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:08,521
My birthday has been inauspicious.
Don't celebrate it, Mom.

329
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:13,208
Whenever this day comes, you cry.
- Not really, Son.

330
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,577
The tears come automatically.

331
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:22,697
What didn't we have?

332
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:31,142
Servants, money,
estate. Hundreds were fed.

333
00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:37,219
We celebrated this day in style.
Cooked a royal feast.

334
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:42,501
How can a house in which an unlucky
boy was born even have a feast?

335
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:50,220
No, Son. Your father always said,
''Our youngest has brought us luck.''

336
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:54,924
''And love falls like rain.''
- And it flowed away like water too.

337
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:00,572
But how brave you were. You
toiled 24 hours. Sewed clothes.

338
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:05,409
And educated me. l'll
be a graduate this year.

339
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:11,746
Mom, you were on your own.
Yet you didn't give up.

340
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:19,916
But God gave up and didn't help.
- Why couldn't fate see me happy?

341
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:25,444
Your father said ''My
sons will be like kings.''

342
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:29,491
No, Mom. Don't cry.

343
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,804
Here, Gopi. Here, Shamu.

344
00:36:34,617 --> 00:36:35,606
Brother, here.

345
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:38,876
Take this.

346
00:36:41,424 --> 00:36:42,846
Here you are, sir.

347
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,385
You always distribute
sweetmeats on this date. Why so?

348
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:54,458
Why do you want to know?
- Just like that.

349
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:58,895
You spend your year's
earnings on this day. What for?

350
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:08,234
Today was the day l lost everything.
Whatever l had saved by oiling..

351
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:14,857
..was all ruined as we
all slept in the night.

352
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,870
l had three children.

353
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:25,611
All three had their
birthday on this very day.

354
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:29,438
Fate snatched those sons from me.

355
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:34,875
Today l distribute these, and pray.

356
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:40,915
May they be alive, wherever
they may be, let them be happy.

357
00:37:43,686 --> 00:37:51,036
Let them live long and may
all their woes come to me.

358
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:04,962
Your coat, Daddy.

359
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,938
Thank you, dear. Please
straighten the collar.

360
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:18,555
Ravi has sent a message from Delhi.
- What does it say?

361
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:21,480
Ravi's coming tomorrow.
- Really?

362
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:25,543
Give that to me.
- Sit and have tea.

363
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:17,106
''Who brought a twinkle in my eyes..

364
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:21,998
..and strummed the strings
of my heart?''

365
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:27,719
''Who brought a twinkle in my eyes..

366
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:31,805
..and strummed the strings
of my heart?''

367
00:39:32,462 --> 00:39:34,805
''Who has come?''

368
00:39:44,474 --> 00:39:48,945
''The wind brought the
news of his coming.''

369
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:53,825
''The wind brought the
news of his coming.''

370
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:58,881
''And the hint to put flowers..''

371
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:03,773
''And the hint to put flowers..''

372
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:17,830
''The soul was stirred and
breath smelt very sweet.''

373
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:22,525
''And the strings of my
sleepy heart strummed joyously.''

374
00:40:22,912 --> 00:40:29,499
''Who brought this twinkle
in my eyes and strummed..

375
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:32,519
..the strings of my heart?''

376
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:35,186
''Who has come?''

377
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:49,644
''His hands have asked
something from my hands.''

378
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:54,543
''His hands have asked
something from my hands.''

379
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:59,562
''His dreams have asked
something from my nights.''

380
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:04,534
''His dreams have asked
something from my nights.''

381
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:18,554
''Music is playing, and
there's bounce in my step..''

382
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:23,172
''The strings of my sleepy
heart strummed joyously.''

383
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:33,196
''Who brought twinkle in my eyes,
strummed the strings of my heart?''

384
00:41:33,649 --> 00:41:36,800
''Who has come?''

385
00:41:38,988 --> 00:41:43,857
Mr. Raja. When did you come?
- Can't recall. l was totally lost.

386
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:49,588
As though the time stopped
and the ground stood still.

387
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:53,276
Only your song echoed in the air.

388
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:57,511
Your laughter is so appealing.

389
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:11,628
Every bit of you is beautiful.

390
00:42:14,357 --> 00:42:19,624
Lucky will be the man who weds you.

391
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:25,309
The same can be said about you too.
- Do you really think so?

392
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:32,318
You didn't answer me.

393
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:37,306
Better if some questions
are left unanswered.

394
00:42:41,384 --> 00:42:46,651
Yes, buy it. lt's not a bad land.
lt'll be good for a factory.

395
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:52,054
Okay, okay. All right.

396
00:42:57,233 --> 00:43:01,340
Hello? Yes speaking. Yes.

397
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:03,127
Did you buy the diamonds?

398
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:07,794
No, no. Don't sell them.

399
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:12,799
Okay. All right.

400
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,817
Well, here l am.

401
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:17,602
Oh, Raja.

402
00:43:19,955 --> 00:43:26,349
You really are King lndra.
- Just lndra. You are the king.

403
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:29,883
Your name meant that, and now,
you're one professionally too.

404
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:35,315
What proof do you have of me
becoming a 'King'? Who told you?

405
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,707
Mr. Mittal. l hear you're
eying his daughter most favourably.

406
00:43:42,178 --> 00:43:45,124
You returned the necklace?
- That's my private matter.

407
00:43:45,848 --> 00:43:49,716
You have no private matter.
Whatever you bring, belongs to me.

408
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:53,035
Even you belong to me.
Everything belongs to me.

409
00:43:53,723 --> 00:43:54,712
Not everything, sir.

410
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,372
l picked you off the streets.

411
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:01,407
You would beg.
- Not beg, sir.

412
00:44:02,865 --> 00:44:05,333
l would pick pockets.
- You know l don't like such talk.

413
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:07,402
Do you know the penalty
for going against me?

414
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:18,068
Don't be a fool, Balbir.

415
00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:26,866
This is not for kids to play with.
Your hand can bleed if this cuts it.

416
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,716
lndian Airlines announces
the flight 405 from Delhi.

417
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:04,453
lndian Airlines announces
the flight 405 from Delhi.

418
00:45:17,807 --> 00:45:20,913
Ms. Meena.
- You, and here?

419
00:45:21,944 --> 00:45:23,445
l went to your place and
learnt you had come here.

420
00:45:25,214 --> 00:45:26,920
These are the first
flowers of this season.

421
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:29,273
Thank you.

422
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,084
Must be someone special
for you to come personally.

423
00:45:34,156 --> 00:45:35,737
For me, everyone is special.

424
00:45:35,891 --> 00:45:38,359
Nobody's common.
- Even l?

425
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:41,490
Why do you rate yourself 'common'?

426
00:45:42,164 --> 00:45:46,157
ls it in my hand to rate myself so?
- Then whose?

427
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,840
Hi, Meena.
- Hi.

428
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:57,508
Hello, Ravi. - Oh, Meena,
have you brought these for me?

429
00:45:58,848 --> 00:46:01,999
You wonderful,
lovely girl, hats off.

430
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,391
They have the scent of your hair.
l said what l wanted to say.

431
00:46:09,525 --> 00:46:10,867
One who hides it here is a coward.

432
00:46:11,861 --> 00:46:15,888
Pin this on my lapel
with your delicate fingers.

433
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:20,234
My life's journey will
be lovelier. Who is he?

434
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,771
Oh, l forgot. This is Mr. Raja.

435
00:46:22,938 --> 00:46:26,089
Think of me as one
of your subjects.

436
00:46:26,942 --> 00:46:31,094
As l sat in the plane, l wondered
what would happen if l died?

437
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,382
l would disappear from this world,
and hearing this news..

438
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,572
..tears would fall as pearls
from somebody's big soulful eyes.

439
00:46:42,892 --> 00:46:45,838
You talk too much. Give
me your luggage ticket.

440
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:48,987
My dear wonderful girl, l forget
everything when l see you. Here.

441
00:46:58,307 --> 00:47:03,859
Very glad to meet you, sir.
- Yes, but we haven't met as yet.

442
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:05,560
Have you hidden the best part?

443
00:47:05,915 --> 00:47:09,499
No, but for that,
one needs good eyes.

444
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,900
lf your desires are like
these gems, l've seen it all.

445
00:47:14,256 --> 00:47:16,520
l'm impressed, all right.
Wonderful diamonds.

446
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:20,516
l'm as good. But you
won't understand it as yet.

447
00:47:20,996 --> 00:47:25,148
So many veils? Never mind.
They'll be removed too, as we meet.

448
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:32,934
l've kept our luggage in the car.
- Okay then, we'll take your leave.

449
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:36,477
Here. A symbol of
our first meeting. Bye.

450
00:47:37,046 --> 00:47:38,035
Bye, bye.
- Bye.

451
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:43,953
Mr. Mohan, Mr. Pritam Singh..

452
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,953
Flight that arrived from Delhi..

453
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,131
Hello, Mr. Serious.

454
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:08,654
My name is Vijay.
- Really?

455
00:48:10,379 --> 00:48:13,007
Listen..listen, will you?

456
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:19,180
You're very strange. A girl
is talking and you ignore her?

457
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:26,983
Going to college then?
l'll take you.

458
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:29,658
Thanks, but l'll go on my own.

459
00:48:30,065 --> 00:48:33,933
Why the frown?
l didn't make the car..

460
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:38,256
lf you refuse, l'll walk with you.

461
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:41,465
Come.

462
00:48:57,626 --> 00:48:59,093
To understand today's poem..

463
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:04,097
..one must know its ambience
and background.

464
00:49:05,034 --> 00:49:08,618
l'll read it out first,
then l'll explain and discuss it.

465
00:49:10,506 --> 00:49:12,576
''Bells ring..''

466
00:49:14,043 --> 00:49:21,119
''Bells ring very softly in
my ears from very far away.''

467
00:49:21,517 --> 00:49:26,989
''Remembering our pranks
and complaints of long ago..''

468
00:49:27,122 --> 00:49:30,512
''..you must be laughing''.

469
00:49:30,726 --> 00:49:32,193
Wonderful.

470
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:42,333
A group from the Cultural
Society is going on a trip.

471
00:49:43,072 --> 00:49:46,496
Those who want to join in,
please raise your hands.

472
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:29,118
''lt's spring, and time
for us to fall in love.''

473
00:50:29,384 --> 00:50:39,134
''lt's spring, and time
for us to fall in love.''

474
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:48,818
''When love has enemies in form
of many woes, how can we love?''

475
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:24,720
''Lighten your heart
of those burdens..

476
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,707
..it's a short life, so, be merry.''

477
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:38,844
''Lighten your heart
of those burdens..

478
00:51:39,188 --> 00:51:42,339
..it's a short life, so, be merry.''

479
00:51:42,591 --> 00:51:52,182
''l've led a very suppressed life,
so, how can l love you?''

480
00:51:52,501 --> 00:52:01,853
''lt's spring and it's time
for us to say yes to love.''

481
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:30,907
''lt's not good to toy with dreams,
it's difficult to face realities.''

482
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:45,722
''lt's not good to toy with dreams,
it's difficult to face realities.''

483
00:52:45,854 --> 00:52:55,684
''Leave your realities to my dreams.
And let's just fall in love.''

484
00:52:55,831 --> 00:53:05,263
''When love has enemies in form
of many woes..how can l love you?''

485
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:34,495
''Remove such cobwebs
from your mind..

486
00:53:34,636 --> 00:53:39,380
..if you wish to live,
then set sail.''

487
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:48,572
''Remove such cobwebs
from your mind..

488
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:53,905
..if you wish to live,
then set sail.''

489
00:53:54,056 --> 00:54:03,692
''There are currents in the water,
so, how can l love you?''

490
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:13,749
''lt's spring, and time
for us to say yes to love.''

491
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:23,719
''lt's spring, and time
for us to say yes to love.''

492
00:54:28,423 --> 00:54:32,291
Hello. - lt's Raja.
- Well Mr. Raja..

493
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:34,611
How come you remembered me?

494
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:41,030
l always remember you, but today,
l wished for something.

495
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:47,974
Wished for what?
- A cup of tea. With you.

496
00:54:48,777 --> 00:54:54,727
Sure. Why the formality?
- Then l'll come over right now.

497
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,750
l'll wait for you.

498
00:54:56,885 --> 00:54:58,307
Bye.
- Bye, bye.

499
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,008
Meena. Hi.
- Hi.

500
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,641
Come down quickly.
- What's the matter?

501
00:55:19,808 --> 00:55:20,797
Oh, please come down.

502
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,331
Why don't you come up?
- Are you coming down or not?

503
00:55:24,012 --> 00:55:25,354
Please, please.

My darling, come.

506
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:38,343
Mr. Raja's coming.
- Don't fret over him.

507
00:55:38,493 --> 00:55:40,358
Worry about the
one who's here. Okay.

508
00:55:40,495 --> 00:55:44,443
Listen, let's just sit here.
- Oh, please come.

509
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,420
Let's go for boating okay?
- Okay.

510
00:56:07,622 --> 00:56:10,443
Ravi. Oh, no.

511
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:17,381
Ravi, don't do that.

512
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:05,430
''When you take me in your arms..''

513
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:11,166
''..and hold me close to you..''

514
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:19,449
''When you take me in your
arms and hold me close to you..''

515
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:28,533
''..many beautiful dreams
appear before my eyes.''

516
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:36,929
''When you take me in your
arms and hold me close..''

517
00:57:37,212 --> 00:57:44,800
''When you take me in your
arms and hold me close..''

518
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:10,575
''The scent of the flowers left the
garden and lingered on my breath.''

519
00:58:10,712 --> 00:58:18,869
''The scent of the flowers left the
garden and lingered on my breath.''

520
00:58:18,987 --> 00:58:27,065
''When the tresses on the
waves opened on their own..''

521
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:35,521
''l walked into the
shelter l like most of all.''

522
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:43,040
''When you take me in your
arms and hold me very close..''

523
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:52,236
''Many beautiful dreams
passed before my eyes.''

524
00:58:52,354 --> 00:58:59,942
''When you take me in your
arms and hold me very close..''

525
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:29,654
''Under the shadows of
the dark erotic clouds..''

526
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:37,948
''Under the shadows of
the dark erotic clouds..''

527
00:59:38,266 --> 00:59:46,014
''When we hold hands
and walk together..''

528
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:54,294
''The road was littered with
flowers fallen from the branches.''

529
00:59:54,683 --> 01:00:01,759
''When you hold me in your
arms very close to you..''

530
01:00:02,757 --> 01:00:10,710
''l see a million beautiful dreams.''

531
01:00:11,032 --> 01:00:18,985
''When you take me in your
arms and hold me close to you..''

532
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:27,293
''When you take me in your
arms and hold me close to you..''

533
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:31,040
This is neutral.

534
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:38,723
First. Second. Third. Fourth.

535
01:00:40,395 --> 01:00:43,023
Now, put it in the neutral. Yes.

536
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,195
Here we go.

537
01:02:17,826 --> 01:02:18,815
Hello. Mr. Raja.

538
01:02:19,093 --> 01:02:23,086
Hello. l came many times,
but didn't meet you.

539
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:27,099
Let alone you, even l don't
get to meet her these days.

540
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:28,497
l don't seem to see you either.

541
01:02:28,837 --> 01:02:31,419
Am l something
worthy of being seen?

542
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:34,280
Well dear chap, how about
a picnic? lt'll be nice.

543
01:02:34,409 --> 01:02:37,151
Picnic?

And the winner will get a prize.

As per the
winner's wishes, or yours?

547
01:02:44,853 --> 01:02:46,434
As per the winner's wishes.
- Right then.

548
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:49,216
Oh, that's wonderful.
- Come, darling girl.

549
01:02:50,191 --> 01:02:52,773
The race is between you and me.
Why involve her in it?

550
01:02:52,994 --> 01:02:54,143
Okay.

551
01:02:54,262 --> 01:02:55,923

Hello, sweetheart.
What's wrong? How can l help?

557
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,390
Sorry, but l can't

558
01:04:57,552 --> 01:04:58,655
Bye, see you.

559
01:06:56,571 --> 01:06:59,358
How wonderful.
Mr. Raja, hats off to you.

How well you drove, overtook, and
won the race. l'm your slave now.

561
01:07:03,444 --> 01:07:06,516
You're a magician.
- Your blessings.

562
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:09,583
l'm very hungry. Let's eat.

563
01:07:09,717 --> 01:07:13,505
Let's go. l'll treat you.
Come, Meena will also come by then.

564

Who won?
- Who else, my dear? Mr. Raja.

565
01:07:30,605 --> 01:07:33,312
My dear girl, the way he drives..

566
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:39,712
Give him the prize of his choice
and give me what you wish.

567
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:41,064
Okay.
- Okay.

568
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:45,137
Go and ask her, Mr. Raja.
- Yes, go on. What do you want?

569
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:50,163
Go on, sir. - This is
between just the two of us.

570
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:54,490
What will ask now? Maybe some
other day, when the time is right.

571
01:07:54,896 --> 01:07:57,080
Let's have tea now.
- Yes.

572
01:07:57,832 --> 01:07:59,572
Come along.
- Come.

573
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:07,447
Vijay. Oh, Vijay, l'm so happy,
you have got a first class.

574
01:08:07,575 --> 01:08:10,157
And you?
- The usual Royal class.

575
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:12,620
Oh, baby.. - Oh,
Vijay, l'm so happy.

576
01:08:14,582 --> 01:08:19,212
Mom. Mom. Mom.

577
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,865
What happened to mom?
- She was in pain.

578
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,189
l called the doctor.

579
01:08:33,768 --> 01:08:38,353
Pain? She never had it before.
- She did, but didn't tell you.

580
01:08:39,607 --> 01:08:42,155
Doctor.
- l've given her an injection now.

581
01:08:42,343 --> 01:08:45,608
Her pain will subside. Get this.

582
01:08:58,559 --> 01:09:01,266
l suggest you take her to Mumbai.

583
01:09:01,562 --> 01:09:05,714
Mumbai?
- Get her treated at Tata Hospital.

584
01:09:07,235 --> 01:09:10,898
ls it serious?
- No, not really.

585
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:14,507
The disease shouldn't be neglected.

586
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:17,922
l'll give you a letter
to a doctor there.

587
01:09:18,246 --> 01:09:19,395
Collect it from my dispensary.

588
01:09:19,513 --> 01:09:20,901
Okay.
- Okay.

589
01:09:54,682 --> 01:09:55,831
What's on your mind?

590
01:09:57,351 --> 01:10:02,903
l'm thinking, when l was inside,
l was helpless.

591
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:07,890
l had left my kids to their fate.

592
01:10:08,029 --> 01:10:10,975
Now, that l'm out,
l'm that same man.

593
01:10:12,366 --> 01:10:15,312
A father, head of the family.

594
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:19,235
l must find them.

595
01:10:19,373 --> 01:10:23,924
But in this vast world,
where will l find them?

596
01:10:24,412 --> 01:10:28,234
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

597
01:10:30,384 --> 01:10:32,329
Easier said than done.

598
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:38,985
l wanted to pen my
son's future myself.

599
01:10:40,761 --> 01:10:46,996
But fate slapped me so hard..we
got scattered like grass-blades.

600
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,598
Today, l'm setting out again..

601
01:10:50,738 --> 01:10:53,810
..to gather the scattered
blades together.

602
01:10:56,677 --> 01:11:00,261
lt's been so long, that even
if my sons stand before me..

603
01:11:00,414 --> 01:11:01,676
l won't know them.

604
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,824
Destiny is sneering at me once more.

605
01:11:10,658 --> 01:11:15,288
What is it? Why are you so quiet?

606
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:21,489
l think the time has
come for us to separate.

607
01:11:23,037 --> 01:11:24,026
Why?

608
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:31,387
Fate can't see me happy for long.
- What are you saying?

609
01:11:35,516 --> 01:11:40,704
Mom's seriously ill.
l've to take her to Mumbai.

610
01:11:56,971 --> 01:12:00,873
l can help you.
- Meaning?

611
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:04,771
l mean it's a very big city.

612
01:12:05,413 --> 01:12:10,999
You don't know anybody there.
You'll need money for treatment too.

613
01:12:12,753 --> 01:12:18,544
lt is not like that. l'll manage
something. - My brother lives there.

614
01:12:18,893 --> 01:12:20,360
We'll be going to him.

615
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:23,977
You're going to be there.
What more do l want?

616
01:12:27,168 --> 01:12:29,557
That's enough for me.

617
01:13:00,468 --> 01:13:02,493
Yes, yes. Coming, coming.

618
01:13:05,906 --> 01:13:11,060
Who are you?
- Time has changed my face too.

619
01:13:12,146 --> 01:13:17,140
My dear friend.

620
01:13:17,718 --> 01:13:22,667
Where were you? We
were told you were dead.

621
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:28,645
Do l look as though l'm living?
l'm just waiting for my time.

622
01:13:28,829 --> 01:13:33,175
But where were you? Why didn't you
contact us? - l'll tell you later.

623
01:13:33,834 --> 01:13:37,736
First, tell me, any news
about my wife and sons?

624
01:13:40,508 --> 01:13:44,899
Not about your sons,
but long time ago, Aziz did say..

625
01:13:45,012 --> 01:13:49,517
..that he saw your wife in Delhi,
in Banswali Lane.

626
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:54,499
Laxmi is alive. My wife is alive.

627
01:13:54,788 --> 01:13:57,177
Hey, wait. Listen, will you?

628
01:14:18,112 --> 01:14:22,776
Who do you want?
- Does Laxmi live here?

629
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,220
She did, but she went to Mumbai.

630
01:14:25,886 --> 01:14:30,960
Mumbai. Do you have her address?

631
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:33,001
No. l don't.

632
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,583
Does anybody else know it?
- No.

633
01:14:40,868 --> 01:14:41,857
Mumbai.

634
01:15:00,588 --> 01:15:03,978
Brother.
- Oh, Renu, welcome to Mumbai.

635
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:09,245
Hello, Father. - Son. Hi, Mom.

636
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,623
Coolie.
- No coolie, thanks.

637
01:15:16,604 --> 01:15:17,593
Take this suitcase.

638
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:30,973
ls it him?

639
01:15:34,355 --> 01:15:39,588
Very sorry. Walk carefully,
and slowly.

640
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,660
Bless you, Son.

641
01:15:43,764 --> 01:15:49,714
l think he's got away.
- Nobody escapes Raja. Come on.

642
01:16:14,995 --> 01:16:20,342
What did the doctor say, Son?
- That you're not to worry.

643
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:24,900
l'm to bring you again after 1 5
days and you're to stay happy.

644
01:16:26,073 --> 01:16:31,340
Happiness is not in my lot.
l've nobody but you now, Son.

645
01:16:56,704 --> 01:16:59,252
Oh, Wow! What a house!
- Thanks.

646
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:03,308
Hey. Your house has a new look.
- This is just a house, sweetheart.

647
01:17:03,444 --> 01:17:06,106
l'll get myself a new look too,
if you say so. Come.

648
01:17:15,789 --> 01:17:19,373
Hi, Aunt. - Bless you, dear.
Where had you too gone?

649
01:17:19,727 --> 01:17:22,719
l had taken her out for tea.

650
01:17:22,896 --> 01:17:25,763
Where's Renu?
- At the back. - Okay.

651
01:17:28,001 --> 01:17:30,663
What delicious sweetmeat.

652
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:38,423
l'm at a place where even
l don't get any news about myself.

653
01:17:39,346 --> 01:17:45,774
l would laugh being lovelorn.
But now, nothing makes me laugh.

654
01:17:47,187 --> 01:17:52,853
Whose thoughts are you lost in?
Are you still in Delhi?

655
01:17:55,863 --> 01:17:59,765
When did you become a poet?
- l read your thoughts correctly.

656
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:04,702
So, tell us who he is.
Whose absence is seen in..

657
01:18:04,838 --> 01:18:11,744
..this untidy hair, this pale
face and the lost look in your eyes.

658
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:17,416
What will you do asking about it?
- l'll amuse you. Console you.

659
01:18:18,085 --> 01:18:20,349
And if possible, help you too.

660
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:23,911
Forget it. Come on, let's have tea.

661
01:18:24,258 --> 01:18:29,810
Tea, my foot.
This disease demands blood.

662
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:37,164
But do you really love somebody?
- lt's an old story now.

663
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:44,361
l was in love, and now, it's over.
- So, he came and went.

664
01:18:45,379 --> 01:18:46,482
Please tell me who he is.

665
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:47,836
l bind you with my oath.

666
01:18:49,383 --> 01:18:50,372
Vijay.

667
01:18:50,884 --> 01:18:53,956
Who's he?
- We studied together.

668
01:18:54,955 --> 01:18:58,504
So, l was right in saying that
your thoughts were in Delhi.

669
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:02,185
He's in Mumbai.
- Really? - Yes.

670
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,353
Then why think? Go meet him.

671
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:07,269
But where in Mumbai?

672
01:19:22,115 --> 01:19:27,223
Excuse me. - Mr. Vijay Kumar.
- Yes. - Please go inside.

673
01:19:27,955 --> 01:19:28,944
Thank You.

674
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:00,356
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

675
01:20:05,225 --> 01:20:07,568
ls this your application?
- Yes.

676
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,830
Any experience?
- No, sir.

677
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:15,323
You're a graduate.

678
01:20:17,337 --> 01:20:18,326
Yes.

679
01:20:19,306 --> 01:20:23,572
Good. Okay.

680
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:25,934
l'll employ you.

681
01:20:27,915 --> 01:20:28,904
Thank you sir.

682
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:32,141
But l want no complaints.
- Okay.

683
01:20:33,987 --> 01:20:35,488
Whether day or night duty..

684
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,591
..you can't refuse to do it.
- No, sir.

685
01:20:39,927 --> 01:20:40,916
One more thing..

686
01:20:41,662 --> 01:20:45,928
Hard work and honesty is my policy.
Don't ever forget it.

687
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:47,322
l won't, sir.

688
01:20:48,368 --> 01:20:51,394
l'll work faithfully, sir.
- You may go.

689
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:53,929
Thank you, sir.

690
01:21:19,099 --> 01:21:22,091
Has Raja come?
- He's not home.

691
01:21:25,706 --> 01:21:27,333
l know where he is.

692
01:21:29,443 --> 01:21:32,185
You had promised to
give something to me.

693
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:34,322
Me?
- Yes.

694
01:21:35,382 --> 01:21:36,371
What?

695
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:40,656
A reward.
- What for?

696
01:21:42,622 --> 01:21:45,568
You've forgotten.
- Absolutely.

697
01:21:46,326 --> 01:21:49,989
And look at my madness.
All my hopes depend on this reward.

698
01:21:50,564 --> 01:21:52,111
That sounds serious.

699
01:21:52,532 --> 01:21:55,114
lf you think so,
otherwise, it's nothing.

700
01:21:55,569 --> 01:21:57,070
Then tell me, what reward?

701
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:01,610
The one you had
promised at the race.

702
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:07,036
Oh, that. l thought it
was over with the fun.

703
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,038
What do you want?

704
01:22:11,418 --> 01:22:16,321
Give me your hand, please.
- Meena..Renu's here, dear.

705
01:22:16,456 --> 01:22:17,445
Hi, Meena.
- Hi.

706
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:18,615
Hello, Raja.
- Hello.

707
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:21,501
Let's play a game of billiards.
- Come. - Come.

708
01:22:34,608 --> 01:22:35,711
Ready?
- Ready.

709
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:51,203
Sir, l think l'll get married.
- Good. Why delay a good decision?

710
01:22:54,327 --> 01:23:01,039
But l want to leave
the decision to you.

711
01:23:01,334 --> 01:23:04,724
Why? You've getting married.
You decide.

712
01:23:05,138 --> 01:23:10,087
l already have.

713
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:11,433
Good shot.

714
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:15,981
But l'll need your help.

715
01:23:16,183 --> 01:23:17,172
What's the problem?

716
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:21,163
Do they have any objection?
Who are they?

717
01:23:22,422 --> 01:23:29,578
They are pretty close, and
the girl too hasn't declined.

718
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:34,779
Then why let anyone interfere?
Fix the date and get married.

719
01:23:35,235 --> 01:23:36,736
l'll attend the wedding too.

720
01:23:38,205 --> 01:23:41,151
Welcome Mr. Chinoy. How
did you lose your way?

721
01:23:41,675 --> 01:23:46,419
l hear that one who loses his
way comes to you. So, l came too.

722
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,330
Welcome. Welcome.

723
01:23:48,515 --> 01:23:49,504
Hello, Raja.
- Hello.

724
01:23:55,255 --> 01:23:58,679
l hear nowadays..
- Fine.

725
01:23:59,459 --> 01:24:00,448
Shot.

726
01:24:16,543 --> 01:24:21,617
l'll take your leave now.
- Hold on. Let's have some tea.

727
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:25,178
Right, sir?
- Good idea. Come long then.

728
01:24:25,485 --> 01:24:27,191
Come on.
- Come, Come.

729
01:24:28,889 --> 01:24:34,077
Meena. No.
- Game. Meena. Coming daddy.

730
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,077
Arrange for some tea, my dear.
- l better go too.

731
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:40,096
Have some tea.
- Let the car come.

732
01:24:40,267 --> 01:24:43,737
Take my car. l'll go
with Raja. Right, Raja?

733
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:47,716
lt's your car, sir.
- Thank you, Uncle. Bye everybody.

734
01:24:47,841 --> 01:24:48,830
l won't be a moment.

735
01:24:49,242 --> 01:24:52,632
Come, let's sit down
and chat a bit.

736
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:56,829
You will come tomorrow?
- Sure l will. - Okay.

737
01:25:03,523 --> 01:25:05,263
Bye.
- Bye. - See you.

738
01:25:26,446 --> 01:25:30,234
Vijay.. Vijay

739
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,209
Where shall l drop you, Ma'am?

740
01:25:37,691 --> 01:25:40,319
Napean Sea Road.
- Fine.

741
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:08,559
Can't two strangers talk?
- You're still lost in the past.

742
01:26:09,522 --> 01:26:16,917
Face the facts. We're what we
are this moment. l'm a driver.

743
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:22,482
You're sitting behind as a boss.
We're far apart in status.

744
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:26,577
There. l've lessened
the distance a bit.

745
01:26:30,377 --> 01:26:33,198
Why did you stop the car?
- The distance between us can't be..

746
01:26:33,346 --> 01:26:36,247
..lessened by you coming in front.

747
01:26:37,684 --> 01:26:39,265
We're not Vijay and Renu now.

748
01:26:39,786 --> 01:26:42,573
But master and driver.
- Okay.

749
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:46,382
Tell me. Why didn't you meet me?

750
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:51,514
Why should l? To show what a
great progress l made here?

751
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:53,388
That l'm a driver now.

752
01:26:55,368 --> 01:27:01,682
l'm not worthy of you now.
- Don't say such things. Please.

753
01:27:02,742 --> 01:27:09,454
You went away and l lost heart.
Thought l'd never find you.

754
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:15,342
But we did meet. Why?
What does destiny have in mind?

755
01:27:15,722 --> 01:27:20,671
Why does it make us meet?
- To make fun of us. To tell us..

756
01:27:20,827 --> 01:27:24,297
..that those who meet at stations
are travellers, not friends.

757
01:27:25,065 --> 01:27:28,011
Their paths, their
destinations are different.

758
01:27:28,668 --> 01:27:29,692
No. No.

759
01:27:30,437 --> 01:27:36,706
Our destination is
the same. l love you.

760
01:27:38,978 --> 01:27:44,371
l love you too.
But my love is foolishness.

761
01:27:45,452 --> 01:27:50,276
l'm a man who doesn't
have a lovely house..

762
01:27:50,423 --> 01:27:52,653
..posh clothes, and no
great identity.

763
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:57,023
Who was born to be an
animal and die as one. - Vijay.

764
01:27:57,364 --> 01:27:59,594
Where will l get those
comforts you're used to from?

765
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:04,924
Where will l keep a millionaire's
daughter? ln a servant-quarter?

766
01:28:18,385 --> 01:28:22,287
Hello. Meena. Yes, Ravi.

767
01:28:24,557 --> 01:28:28,584
l've seen a sort of a dream.
- Tell me about it.

768
01:28:29,129 --> 01:28:34,078
Won't feel shy, will you?
- Not with you, l won't.

769
01:28:35,135 --> 01:28:43,804
''l saw that from among the
branches laden with flowers..''

770
01:28:44,144 --> 01:28:51,732
''You came near me.''

771
01:28:54,788 --> 01:29:03,105
''As though we've been
together since time began..''

772
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:11,483
''As if we have longed
for this moment for ever.''

773
01:29:17,177 --> 01:29:21,807
Even l've seen a dream.
- Go on, tell me about it to.

774
01:29:22,115 --> 01:29:26,745
You won't be angry with yourself?
- No, not with myself.

775
01:29:27,554 --> 01:29:35,381
''l saw that near the singing..''

776
01:29:35,528 --> 01:29:44,118
''..waters, you told me
your tormenting feelings.''

777
01:29:46,973 --> 01:29:55,403
''Your voice
quivering with emotion..''

778
01:29:55,548 --> 01:30:03,501
''..you told me
what was in my heart.''

779
01:30:32,519 --> 01:30:41,473
''The ice felt hot under the feet..''

780
01:30:41,594 --> 01:30:49,182
''..and l realised love is so warm.''

781
01:30:52,171 --> 01:30:59,486
''That your hard marble-like body..''

782
01:30:59,612 --> 01:31:08,486
''..turns soft and
supple at my touch.''

783
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:38,527
''l've seen that in a foggy valley..''

784
01:31:38,651 --> 01:31:46,808
''..l tell you 'let's
get lost somewhere.''

785
01:02:19,875 --> 01:31:58,104
[ Skipped item nr. 787 ]

786
01:31:58,104 --> 01:32:05,738
''Just pull a sheet
of passion and doze.''

787
01:32:40,647 --> 01:32:45,118
Do you realise how
different you and Meena are?

788
01:32:45,985 --> 01:32:47,009
Meaning?

789
01:32:48,655 --> 01:32:52,887
You break the law.
Her father is a keeper of the law.

790
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:59,209
You're an unknown, destitute, and
she is rich in money and lineage.

791
01:32:59,999 --> 01:33:03,184
You are a thief. He is a judge.

792
01:33:04,671 --> 01:33:06,935
lf he comes to know
your true identity..

793
01:33:07,807 --> 01:33:10,150
..guess what will happen.

794
01:33:11,778 --> 01:33:16,727
But who will expose me?
- Your actions.

795
01:33:19,786 --> 01:33:21,970
That's why l've
given up doing all this.

796
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:27,625
But suppose your past
catches up with you and..

797
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,184
..reveals itself, then?

798
01:33:31,431 --> 01:33:34,377
You mean my life is in your hands?

799
01:33:35,435 --> 01:33:39,906
No, it's the other
way round, in fact.

800
01:33:40,773 --> 01:33:43,719
You know my mania for diamonds.

801
01:33:44,444 --> 01:33:47,948
And Her Majesty will
be in town tomorrow.

802
01:33:49,215 --> 01:33:52,958
She's a diamond mine.
Only you can do this.

803
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:59,400
And what if l don't?
- Then Raja..

804
01:34:00,793 --> 01:34:04,183
l can hate as much as l can love.

805
01:34:04,464 --> 01:34:10,414
Love and hate? Sir,
those who live in glass-houses..

806
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:13,766
..don't throw stones at others.

807
01:34:29,422 --> 01:34:31,811
Hello, Raja.
- How are you, sir? - Fine.

808
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,061
Where are all the others?

809
01:34:33,326 --> 01:34:37,114
Meena has gone swimming with Ravi.
- Swimming?

810
01:34:44,437 --> 01:34:47,144
Come. Come.

811
01:34:49,442 --> 01:34:50,431
Come.

812
01:35:37,824 --> 01:35:39,291
Come on, now. Let's go.

813
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:53,960
Not this one.
- So sorry. - Okay.

814
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,828
Don't do this Ravi.

815
01:36:05,084 --> 01:36:07,029
Ravi. Please don't do it. No.

816
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:14,091
l'm feeling scared.
- Even when you're near me?

817
01:36:14,493 --> 01:36:16,518
That's why l'm scared.
- Why?

818
01:36:16,963 --> 01:36:18,430
Put the light on first.

819
01:36:30,009 --> 01:36:31,431
Meena.
- Yes.

820
01:36:32,945 --> 01:36:33,934
Now tell me.

821
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:39,180
l like you very much.
- Really?

822
01:36:48,628 --> 01:36:51,893
Meena.
- Yes.

823
01:36:53,566 --> 01:36:54,555
Come closer.

824
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:59,059
Okay?

825
01:37:00,573 --> 01:37:01,562
A bit more.

826
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:07,935
Meena.

827
01:37:11,584 --> 01:37:13,848
Can you hear my heart beating?

828
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:23,845
And can you hear mine?
- Yes, very much so.

829
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:33,450
l feel like breaking all barriers.
- So, what are you waiting for?

830
01:37:34,941 --> 01:37:40,527
A signal from you.
- There. l gave it to you. Happy?

831
01:37:42,581 --> 01:37:45,402
Let's get married.

832
01:37:46,686 --> 01:37:49,951
Why don't you talk to daddy?
- You do it.

833
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:51,873
l feel shy.

834
01:38:00,266 --> 01:38:01,528
What anger are you venting on them?

835
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:06,551
l'm invited to the engagement
of Mr. Mittal's daughter.

836
01:38:07,707 --> 01:38:10,972
You're one of the family,
you must be invited too.

837
01:38:12,979 --> 01:38:13,968
But of course.

838
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:20,422
But my mistake, there's
Ravi's name as the fiance.

839
01:38:21,053 --> 01:38:23,999
You must have felt happy since
you've come to congratulate me.

840
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:29,067
l thought you'd need someone at
this hour of sadness, so, l came.

841
01:38:29,528 --> 01:38:33,316
My sorrow won't need
hired mourners.

842
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,987
But now, even the real
sufferers can't do a thing.

843
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:40,935
Anyway.. What you saw was a dream.

844
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:45,003
What you heard, was a tale.
Come back to your own world.

845
01:38:46,312 --> 01:38:50,703
Raja never looks back, sir.

846
01:40:40,392 --> 01:40:42,576
Babloo? My brother?

847
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:57,802
Babloo, Babloo.

848
01:40:59,879 --> 01:41:01,540
Babloo, My dear brother.

849
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:03,337
My brother, Babloo.

850
01:41:03,782 --> 01:41:05,807
Babloo.

851
01:41:06,152 --> 01:41:08,382
Babloo.

852
01:41:14,426 --> 01:41:15,814
No. No.

853
01:41:27,339 --> 01:41:29,079
l've been looking for you.
- What happened?

854
01:41:29,241 --> 01:41:31,391
Come. - Where are you taking me?
Come on.

855
01:41:33,245 --> 01:41:34,234
A song.

856
01:41:34,413 --> 01:41:35,835
Renu.
- Please sing.

857
01:41:55,768 --> 01:42:00,319
''My face reflects happiness..''

858
01:42:00,539 --> 01:42:04,885
''..and there's pride in my eyes.''

859
01:42:05,211 --> 01:42:09,159
''My face reflects happiness..''

860
01:42:09,548 --> 01:42:13,814
''..and there's pride in my eyes.''

861
01:42:13,953 --> 01:42:18,140
''When you call me your own..''

862
01:42:18,357 --> 01:42:22,748
''l feel so proud of myself.''

863
01:42:22,962 --> 01:42:27,467
''My face reflects joy.''

864
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:49,642
''You're very handsome yourself..''

865
01:42:49,855 --> 01:42:54,406
''Maybe you don't know it.''

866
01:42:56,528 --> 01:43:00,840
''You're very handsome yourself..''

867
01:43:01,267 --> 01:43:05,294
''Maybe you don't know it.''

868
01:43:05,504 --> 01:43:09,691
''Maybe you don't know it.''

869
01:43:09,875 --> 01:43:18,829
''That when you enter a party,
everything seems brighter.''

870
01:43:19,018 --> 01:43:23,205
''When you call me your own..''

871
01:43:23,422 --> 01:43:27,847
''l feel so proud of myself.''

872
01:43:28,027 --> 01:43:32,532
''My face radiates with joy.''

873
01:43:49,982 --> 01:43:54,453
''When l fell in love with you..''

874
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:59,272
''..the secret unfolded.''

875
01:44:01,393 --> 01:44:05,625
''When l fell in love with you..''

876
01:44:05,831 --> 01:44:09,983
''..the secret unfolded.''

877
01:44:10,336 --> 01:44:14,523
''Then the secret unfolded.''

878
01:44:14,707 --> 01:44:19,019
''Like death being at hand..''

879
01:44:19,378 --> 01:44:23,644
''..for someone to
realise life's worth.''

880
01:44:23,849 --> 01:44:28,001
''When you call me your own..''

881
01:44:28,354 --> 01:44:32,506
''l feel so proud of myself.''

882
01:44:32,725 --> 01:44:36,877
''My face reflects with happiness..''

883
01:44:37,096 --> 01:44:41,487
''..and there's pride in my eyes.''

884
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:46,683
''My face radiates with joy.''

885
01:45:00,686 --> 01:45:06,079
Hello. - Congratulations for
the engagement. - Thank you.

886
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:08,814
You look very happy today.

887
01:45:08,994 --> 01:45:11,337
Yes. l'm very, very happy.

888
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:15,059
Then l can ask for my reward.

889
01:45:23,976 --> 01:45:24,965
Yes.

890
01:45:26,478 --> 01:45:30,710
l ask that don't ever trouble Ravi.

891
01:45:31,016 --> 01:45:36,443
Give him that joy which no
woman has given to a man till now.

892
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:40,657
Raja..
- Darling, my dear, my beloved.

893
01:45:40,826 --> 01:45:43,727
Mr. Raja, l was looking for you.
Where were you last night?

894
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:50,380
Last night was nightmarish.
l saw such a bad dream..

895
01:45:50,502 --> 01:45:55,087
..that its memory unnerves me.
- What was the dream?

896
01:45:55,741 --> 01:45:56,730
Let's hear it.

897
01:45:57,476 --> 01:46:01,663
l saw you sleeping in your bed.

898
01:46:03,015 --> 01:46:08,408
l'm holding a dagger, and slowly..

899
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:11,990
l'm approaching you.
- Then?

900
01:46:13,459 --> 01:46:18,408
Then you suddenly turned into a tot.

901
01:46:18,964 --> 01:46:21,592
And you called out
'brother' and hugged me.

902
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:22,983
That was a dream.

903
01:46:23,502 --> 01:46:25,686
Let's hug each other
like real brothers.

904
01:46:29,208 --> 01:46:30,550
Ravi.. - Yes.

905
01:46:38,116 --> 01:46:39,856
You looked like a
heavenly nymph last night.

906
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:42,847
Really?
- Yes.

907
01:46:44,223 --> 01:46:47,852
Meena said when l get married
she'll give a grander party.

908
01:46:50,562 --> 01:46:54,066
Your marriage?
- Yes. With you.

909
01:46:57,169 --> 01:47:01,799
When will you stop dreaming?
- When will you start dreaming?

910
01:47:06,178 --> 01:47:08,726
Okay, here l go.
- What did you see?

911
01:47:09,948 --> 01:47:13,532
You took me to meet your parents.

912
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:18,455
They very sweetly asked me,
''Son, what do you do?''

913
01:47:19,024 --> 01:47:20,013
Then?

914
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:26,904
l said, ''l'm Mr. Chinoy's driver''.
They we shocked hearing this.

915
01:47:27,266 --> 01:47:29,894
And said ''What do you want?''

916
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:35,821
l replied, ''l want to
be your son-in-law.''

917
01:47:36,074 --> 01:47:40,545
''l want to marry Renu.''
- And what did they say?

918
01:47:40,712 --> 01:47:46,537
They hugged me and said,
''You've made my dream come true.''

919
01:47:47,019 --> 01:47:53,015
l too wanted her to marry some
pauper. You're so very nice.

920
01:47:53,659 --> 01:47:55,809
You made my dream a reality.
- Vijay.

921
01:47:57,763 --> 01:47:59,913
After that, my eyes opened.
- No.

922
01:48:00,933 --> 01:48:04,721
You don't know my parents.
They are liberal minded.

923
01:48:06,305 --> 01:48:11,493
And my brother loves me so much.
He'll do anything for my happiness.

924
01:48:11,643 --> 01:48:12,871
Come with me.
- No.

925
01:48:13,312 --> 01:48:14,813
Why not? Meet my brother.

926
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:17,722
No, Renu.
- Please, come. - Renu..

927
01:48:18,183 --> 01:48:20,572
Renu, don't be stubborn.
- Sit.

928
01:48:23,622 --> 01:48:25,567
You trouble me a lot. Let's go.

929
01:48:55,621 --> 01:48:56,610
Brother.

930
01:48:59,725 --> 01:49:01,226
Brother, meet..
- l know him.

931
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:03,302
He's Mr. Chinoy's driver.

932
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:07,655
But he's my friend.
- What?

933
01:49:07,899 --> 01:49:11,687
Yes. So what?
- You better go in.

934
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:13,551
Brother.
- l said go in.

935
01:49:19,144 --> 01:49:20,884
You seemed to have
forgotten who you are.

936
01:49:21,647 --> 01:49:22,750
You're a driver and..

937
01:49:22,881 --> 01:49:25,748
..you don't even know that
there are two sets of seats.

938
01:49:26,218 --> 01:49:29,324
The one who sits in the front is
the driver. One behind, the master.

939
01:49:30,122 --> 01:49:31,862
You dare come here again.

940
01:49:34,026 --> 01:49:36,017
Very well, sir.
- Get out.

941
01:49:48,373 --> 01:49:53,037
What right do you have to behave
like this? l praise you sky-high.

942
01:49:53,345 --> 01:49:54,972
l respect you so much.

943
01:49:55,213 --> 01:49:56,794
And you insult my friend?

944
01:49:57,349 --> 01:49:58,930
Why did you make a
driver your friend?

945
01:49:59,117 --> 01:50:00,698
ls it a sin or a
crime to be a driver?

946
01:50:01,253 --> 01:50:05,041
You judge a person according
to his work? Shame.

947
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:07,066
But who is he? Where is he from?

948
01:50:07,192 --> 01:50:09,262
What's his family name?
- Do you know yours? - Renu.

949
01:50:09,828 --> 01:50:12,934
Did they ask your background
when they picked you off a street?

950
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:15,348
And what are you today?
You can't stand on your own feet.

951
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,918
lf not helped, you will
starve to death. - Renu.

952
01:50:19,104 --> 01:50:22,847
What are you babbling?
- She's right.

953
01:50:24,042 --> 01:50:25,384
l had forgotten.

954
01:50:26,445 --> 01:50:27,946
She woke me up.

955
01:50:36,455 --> 01:50:40,357
Sorry, l can't let Meena wed Ravi.
l've to be one with the fish.

956
01:50:40,726 --> 01:50:46,881
lf l wed her to an orphan,
what will people say?

957
01:50:47,132 --> 01:50:53,685
Let them talk. You see to yourself.
- Forget such petty things.

958
01:50:53,805 --> 01:50:56,353
lt was a kids spat.
- True.

959
01:50:56,475 --> 01:50:58,739
But he isn't your son, is he?

960
01:50:58,944 --> 01:51:03,688
Then whose? l've brought him up.
- Reared him, not a blood relation.

961
01:51:04,015 --> 01:51:08,281
God knows whether he's a Hindu,
a Muslim, a Christian or what else.

962
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:12,322
Why are you stuck on this caste
issue? You're educated people.

963
01:51:12,491 --> 01:51:14,755
l've tried to convince her,
but she refuses to listen.

964
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,946
l've no objection.
- But l have.

965
01:51:17,763 --> 01:51:20,231
Education has its own place.
lt can't go against faith.

966
01:51:21,099 --> 01:51:26,969
Main point is, she's my only child.
l won't wed her to a street monger.

967
01:51:27,172 --> 01:51:28,161
You're right.

968
01:51:34,246 --> 01:51:37,716
Why are you fighting over me?
l'm going away.

969
01:51:37,849 --> 01:51:38,838
Where?

970
01:51:39,785 --> 01:51:44,734
Where nobody will ask my parents
name. Where my name will be enough.

971
01:51:50,929 --> 01:51:51,918
Ravi.

972
01:53:59,524 --> 01:54:03,517
Tears don't suit your eyes.

973
01:54:05,664 --> 01:54:10,852
You had sought
worldly joys for Ravi.

974
01:54:12,203 --> 01:54:14,865
And today.. - Today, l still
ask for the same joys.

975
01:54:16,441 --> 01:54:21,344
l've blessed you as an elder.
Today, l'll live up to it.

976
01:54:30,689 --> 01:54:31,872
Come on.

977
01:54:39,698 --> 01:54:44,283
Welcome, Raja.
How did you remember me?

978
01:54:45,036 --> 01:54:48,506
Goods go to a buyer usually, sir.

979
01:54:49,374 --> 01:54:52,366
And there's no
bigger buyer than you.

980
01:54:56,414 --> 01:54:57,403
What are your goods?

981
01:54:58,383 --> 01:55:02,934
l've come to sell myself again.
- The price?

982
01:55:04,622 --> 01:55:08,444
You mustn't have seen
various forms of love.

983
01:55:09,728 --> 01:55:14,916
The love for which l wanted to go
straight is leading me astray again.

984
01:55:16,668 --> 01:55:21,935
Meaning? - l've blessed Meena,
as somebody elder.

985
01:55:22,073 --> 01:55:26,180
l've asked all the
joys for Ravi from her.

986
01:55:27,012 --> 01:55:28,001
Why?

987
01:55:29,614 --> 01:55:32,959
Ravi's my brother.
- What?

988
01:55:33,618 --> 01:55:34,607
Real brother.

989
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,271
When did you come
to know this secret?

990
01:55:39,357 --> 01:55:44,943
The night before the betrothal,
when l had gone to kill Ravi.

991
01:55:46,097 --> 01:55:52,445
And today everything's ruined.
Their engagement is broken.

992
01:55:53,171 --> 01:55:57,642
Ravi has left home.
They want Ravi's father's name.

993
01:55:57,776 --> 01:56:03,123
And only l know it.
- Then why don't you tell them?

994
01:56:06,051 --> 01:56:11,603
Because l have a past
which is known to just one man.

995
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:16,738
You mean me.

996
01:56:17,595 --> 01:56:25,149
Yes.. The price is
that l'll sell my soul.

997
01:56:26,137 --> 01:56:29,322
l'll be your obedient slave forever.

998
01:56:31,476 --> 01:56:37,028
ln return, you won't
reveal anything.

999
01:56:37,148 --> 01:56:39,013
So that my ill-reputation..

1000
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:41,095
..doesn't effect Ravi's future.

1001
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:46,239
l agree to the deal.

1002
01:56:48,293 --> 01:56:52,036
l want to declare Ravi's
true identity proudly.

1003
01:56:53,765 --> 01:56:56,472
And l'll throw a grand

Oh, Renu. My darling, my sweetie.

''This part is held together

''So, stop and think,
those who live..''

''For the future is uncertain..''.

''Every event after this
moment will seem a dream.''

1070
02:05:52,970 --> 02:05:58,715
''Who has seen tomorrow?
Who knows what'll happen then?''

1071
02:05:58,976 --> 02:06:04,562
''Take what you want to
take from this moment.''

1072

''Those who are living, just think.''

''For the future is uncertain..''

1075
02:06:18,262 --> 02:06:21,607
My darling, why are you alone?

Waiting for me? Come then..

1077

Where are you going,
darling? Come near me..

1078
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:34,154
You scum. Don't you know
how to talk to decent ladies?

1079
02:06:34,278 --> 02:06:38,829
''The future is uncertain..''

1080
02:06:39,417 --> 02:06:41,681
''..the past, unknown.''

1081
02:06:41,819 --> 02:06:43,002
You hit me?

1082
02:06:45,089 --> 02:06:46,272
You hit me?

1083
02:06:46,957 --> 02:06:47,946
You hit me?

1084
02:06:48,092 --> 02:06:50,640
''What we do have
however is this moment.''

1085
02:06:50,761 --> 02:06:51,750
You hit me?

1086
02:06:51,896 --> 02:06:56,367
''What we do have
however is this moment.''

1087
02:06:57,168 --> 02:07:02,322
''What we do have
however is this moment.''

1088
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:07,994
''What we do have
however is this moment.''

1089
02:07:09,447 --> 02:07:09,880
Fool. l'll kill you.

1090
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:13,111
Fool. l'll kill you.

1091
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:14,638
l'll kill you.

1092
02:07:17,321 --> 02:07:19,789
You worm. l'll kill you.

1093
02:07:19,924 --> 02:07:21,664
l'll kill you.

1094
02:07:24,128 --> 02:07:25,311
You idiot.

1095
02:07:25,463 --> 02:07:28,648
Raja, stop it. - Mr. Chinoy..
- He's drunk.

1096
02:07:28,799 --> 02:07:30,869
Come on. Get up.
- Come on.

1097
02:07:49,153 --> 02:07:53,704
Lucky people have friends like you.

1098
02:07:55,359 --> 02:07:57,145
Today, you've
proved your friendship.

1099
02:07:58,763 --> 02:08:01,914
How shall l tell you what
l was going to do today?

1100
02:08:03,167 --> 02:08:07,069
l didn't get a chance to talk.
God decided to be merciless.

1101
02:08:08,172 --> 02:08:10,720
lt's an old habit with him.

1102
02:08:11,509 --> 02:08:15,900
Today, he was really angry with me.

1103
02:08:16,781 --> 02:08:19,045
Anyway, some other time.

1104
02:08:21,786 --> 02:08:24,448
Come, l'll drop you home.

1105
02:08:37,134 --> 02:08:38,123
What is it?

1106
02:08:39,336 --> 02:08:45,730
lt's very serious, but treatable.
- But what's wrong?

1107
02:08:46,944 --> 02:08:48,013
She has cancer.

1108
02:08:51,549 --> 02:08:54,336
Cancer?
- Yes, in the stomach.

1109
02:08:55,219 --> 02:08:56,925
Must be operated at once.

1110
02:08:58,956 --> 02:08:59,945
Okay.

1111
02:09:01,492 --> 02:09:05,041
Listen, don't tell your mother.

1112
02:09:06,564 --> 02:09:09,909
Right. Your fees?

1113
02:09:10,167 --> 02:09:16,754
Rs.40.
- l've just Rs.30 on me.

1114
02:09:17,107 --> 02:09:19,769
Never mind.
- l'll pay you later.

1115
02:09:32,256 --> 02:09:35,202
Come, Mom.
- What did he say?

1116
02:09:36,527 --> 02:09:40,998
lt's a minor thing,
but needs surgery.

1117
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:46,263
Operation? That costs a lot.

1118
02:09:46,937 --> 02:09:51,089
So? l'll borrow. My boss is nice.

1119
02:09:51,408 --> 02:09:54,798
You called me, sir?
- Yes.

1120
02:09:56,614 --> 02:09:58,798
Didn't you know who was hosting it?

1121
02:09:59,483 --> 02:10:01,826
You embarrassed me in
front of elite company.

1122
02:10:02,219 --> 02:10:03,208
Fool. Fiend.

1123
02:10:03,554 --> 02:10:06,136
Did you have to choose that
night to attack one of our own?

1124
02:10:07,024 --> 02:10:08,810
Hold on..
- Shut up.

1125
02:10:09,026 --> 02:10:11,574
Why did you attack Meena?
She is a judge's daughter.

1126
02:10:11,896 --> 02:10:14,080
l, your boss, had invited them.

1127
02:10:14,632 --> 02:10:17,294
You're getting angry over..
- Quiet.

1128
02:10:21,505 --> 02:10:26,295
You hit me?

1129
02:10:27,077 --> 02:10:28,066
You dare do this?

1130
02:10:28,979 --> 02:10:36,977
You hit me? You strike me?

1131
02:13:29,093 --> 02:13:34,247
What did you see?
- Everything.

1132
02:13:37,301 --> 02:13:41,294
You saw nothing. Your mom's ill.

1133
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:48,032
What did the doctor say?
- Cancer. She needs an operation.

1134
02:13:50,247 --> 02:13:54,798
You'll need money for it.
l'll give it to you.

1135
02:15:30,948 --> 02:15:32,131
Come on.

1136
02:15:34,685 --> 02:15:38,155
Did you call?
- Yes, this way. - Thank you.

1137
02:15:41,625 --> 02:15:42,614
Here. He is.

1138
02:15:49,967 --> 02:15:51,434
He has escaped.

1139
02:16:11,855 --> 02:16:13,641
Let me go. - l'll not leave you.

1140
02:16:13,790 --> 02:16:20,263
Let me go, l say. For God's sake.

1141
02:16:46,957 --> 02:16:47,946
Why are you silent?

1142
02:16:51,428 --> 02:16:56,218
Do you too think l killed him?
- No.

1143
02:16:57,968 --> 02:17:00,675
Have you decided upon a lawyer?

1144
02:17:01,571 --> 02:17:05,917
No, but l've selected one.

1145
02:17:06,643 --> 02:17:09,715
Who?
- Ravi.

1146
02:17:10,781 --> 02:17:12,248
Ravi.
- Yes.

1147
02:17:12,983 --> 02:17:14,245
But he's a greenhorn.

1148
02:17:14,384 --> 02:17:20,254
He hasn't fought a case as yet.
lt's a question of life and death.

1149
02:17:21,058 --> 02:17:25,245
You should employ a top lawyer.
- Top lawyer?

1150
02:17:27,798 --> 02:17:31,700
lf Ravi wins this case,
he too will become a top lawyer..

1151
02:17:32,402 --> 02:17:36,554
Yes, but you can't gamble with life.

1152
02:17:37,741 --> 02:17:44,294
ls it? l've always gambled with it.

1153
02:17:45,015 --> 02:17:48,280
Let me try this last time.

1154
02:17:48,418 --> 02:17:53,811
Did you call me?

1155
02:17:55,759 --> 02:17:57,499
You'll fight my case, Ravi.

1156
02:17:58,095 --> 02:18:01,679
What?
- You're my lawyer.

1157
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:07,890
lf anything goes wrong,
l'll never forgive myself.

1158
02:18:08,438 --> 02:18:12,306
l respect you like an elder brother.

1159
02:18:12,776 --> 02:18:18,646
For the sake of that brotherly love,
you'll have to fight my case.

1160
02:18:20,117 --> 02:18:22,301
You'll have to fight,
Ravi. Give me your hand.

1161
02:18:24,855 --> 02:18:25,844
Come on..

1162
02:18:46,877 --> 02:18:47,946
Good morning. Good morning.

1163
02:18:48,078 --> 02:18:54,745
Unbelievable. Setting aside all the
top lawyers, Raja chose a lawyer..

1164
02:18:55,085 --> 02:18:59,351
..who hasn't seen a court yet.
- Let alone fighting a case..

1165
02:18:59,489 --> 02:19:05,564
..he can't address the judge.
- Poor Raja. God have mercy on him.

1166
02:19:06,496 --> 02:19:09,761
Your Honour, we've
considered the facts.

1167
02:19:10,634 --> 02:19:14,024
This case for which
we stand before you.

1168
02:19:15,038 --> 02:19:19,702
To prove that it's a murder case,
we've to prove three things.

1169
02:19:20,577 --> 02:19:22,363
One, that this murder was..

1170
02:19:22,512 --> 02:19:26,380
..done with a specific motive,
intention, and plan.

1171
02:19:26,917 --> 02:19:30,387
Two, the killer waited..

1172
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:35,105
..for the right
opportunity to strike.

1173
02:19:35,859 --> 02:19:39,932
Three. When he got
the right opportunity..

1174
02:19:40,063 --> 02:19:42,611
..he went ahead and did it.

1175
02:19:42,999 --> 02:19:48,744
Your Honour, to prove that
the accused was the killer..

1176
02:19:49,139 --> 02:19:50,640
..l will call a witness..

1177
02:19:51,541 --> 02:19:55,443
..who saw everything and
also heard everything.

1178
02:19:56,012 --> 02:19:58,594
My first witness is..
Wing Commander.

1179
02:19:59,216 --> 02:20:00,399
Wing Commander Mehra.

1180
01:48:52,854 --> 02:20:03,887
Were you present at that party
where this fight took place?

1181
02:20:03,887 --> 02:20:04,876
Yes.

1182
02:20:05,021 --> 02:20:09,412
Mr. Mehra, can you tell us
what you saw and heard there?

1183
02:20:10,494 --> 02:20:13,440
l saw the deceased
and Raja fighting..

1184
02:20:14,231 --> 02:20:19,419
..and heard Raja threaten the man.
-Thank you, Mr. Mehra.

1185
02:20:30,113 --> 02:20:33,776
What do you do for a living?
- l'm a college principal.

1186
02:20:34,251 --> 02:20:37,516
What do you know about this case?

1187
02:20:37,988 --> 02:20:40,456
l was present at the party too.

1188
02:20:40,724 --> 02:20:43,466
The accused had threatened
to kill the deceased.

1189
02:20:43,793 --> 02:20:45,454
Thank you, sir. Your witness.

1190
02:20:48,798 --> 02:20:49,787
No questions.

1191
02:20:50,934 --> 02:20:55,883
We were having food
when l heard a commotion.

1192
02:20:56,139 --> 02:21:00,803
l went to check..and saw
people running towards the garden.

1193
02:21:01,745 --> 02:21:06,648
Then? - When l saw them going,
l thought what would've happened.

1194
02:21:07,083 --> 02:21:10,109
When you went, what did you see?

1195
02:21:11,555 --> 02:21:15,707
l saw him and the man who died.
They were fighting.

1196
02:21:16,092 --> 02:21:18,834
This man was bashing
the deceased and..

1197
02:21:18,962 --> 02:21:21,510
..saying ''l'll chop you to pieces.''

1198
02:21:22,566 --> 02:21:25,512
Thank you. - Thanks a lot, please.
- Your witness.

1199
02:21:29,172 --> 02:21:30,161
No question?

1200
02:21:34,844 --> 02:21:39,508
Your Highness,
what do you know of this?

1201
02:21:39,983 --> 02:21:43,851
l saw that the
deceased was bleeding, and..

1202
02:21:43,987 --> 02:21:46,729
Mr. Chinoy was
trying to separate them.

1203
02:21:48,124 --> 02:21:52,231
Did you hear what Raja said then?

1204
02:21:52,596 --> 02:21:56,498
He said ''l'll have your blood.''

1205
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:58,540
Thank you, Your Honour.
Your witness.

1206
02:22:00,804 --> 02:22:03,193
Your Highness, Raja said,
''l'll have your blood.''

1207
02:22:03,673 --> 02:22:06,540
Did you hear exactly those words?
- Yes.

1208
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:08,198
Sure?
- Yes.

1209
02:22:08,645 --> 02:22:11,910
But the first witness
said ''l'll kill you.''

1210
02:22:12,349 --> 02:22:14,658
The second said,
''chop you up'' and now..

1211
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:20,256
..you're saying ''have your blood''.
So, who's telling the whole truth?

1212
02:22:21,024 --> 02:22:25,575
l am.
- That means the others were lying.

1213
02:22:26,096 --> 02:22:27,085
Could be.

1214
02:22:27,230 --> 02:22:28,219
Thank you, Your Honour.

1215
02:22:29,232 --> 02:22:35,899
The statements made by the three
witnesses presented do not tally.

1216
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:38,949
One said ''l'll kill you'',
the second said..

1217
02:22:39,075 --> 02:22:41,100
..''l chop you'' and the third says..

1218
02:22:41,378 --> 02:22:42,561
''l'll have your blood.''

1219
02:22:42,712 --> 02:22:44,293
l wonder, by presenting
these three witnesses..

1220
02:22:44,648 --> 02:22:45,637
..who say three different things,,

1221
02:22:45,915 --> 02:22:47,940
,,what is my learned friend saying?

1222
02:22:49,185 --> 02:22:52,177
l want to say that..

1223
02:22:52,322 --> 02:22:59,910
..witnesses can't always
say the exact words.

1224
02:23:00,664 --> 02:23:04,054
Every person uses different
words to say something.

1225
02:23:04,668 --> 02:23:08,058
l want to give stress on the
true meaning of these words.

1226
02:23:08,705 --> 02:23:12,129
And the meaning is, the accused
threatened to kill the deceased.

1227
02:23:12,676 --> 02:23:15,338
Why was the threat made?
Why was the man murdered?

1228
02:23:15,945 --> 02:23:19,096
To know all this,
l'd like to call Ms. Meena.

1229
02:23:19,683 --> 02:23:22,026
Ms. Meena, please be present.

1230
02:23:42,706 --> 02:23:45,095
''l'll tell the truth and
nothing but the truth.''

1231
02:23:45,909 --> 02:23:49,174
''l'll tell the truth and
nothing but the truth.''

1232
02:23:52,115 --> 02:23:56,267
Do you know the accused?
- Yes.

1233
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:58,745
How long have you known him?
- Many days now.

1234
02:23:59,723 --> 02:24:03,830
Can you tell us when you met
him and under what circumstances?

1235
02:24:05,395 --> 02:24:07,386
He came with a necklace.

1236
02:24:07,731 --> 02:24:10,393
To sell?
- No.

1237
02:24:10,734 --> 02:24:13,965
As a gift then?
- No.

1238
02:24:14,337 --> 02:24:17,682
Then why did he bring it?
- My necklace was had been stolen.

1239
02:24:18,341 --> 02:24:20,206
My father had bought it
as a birthday gift for me.

1240
02:24:21,144 --> 02:24:26,696
At night, the thief dropped
it in his yard while running.

1241
02:24:26,950 --> 02:24:30,215
So, he came to return it to you?
- Yes.

1242
02:24:30,754 --> 02:24:32,699
Must be an ordinary one.
- No.

1243
02:24:32,956 --> 02:24:35,026
lt was an expensive one.
Made of diamonds.

1244
02:24:36,359 --> 02:24:40,864
lt's his goodness that he returned
it. Anybody else would've kept it.

1245
02:24:42,365 --> 02:24:47,712
So, after this proof of his decency,
you both must've met quite often.

1246
02:24:50,173 --> 02:24:52,721
He visited our house frequently.
- Of course, why not?

1247
02:24:52,976 --> 02:24:56,127
ln this way, a friendship formed
between you both. lt's obvious..

1248
02:24:56,279 --> 02:25:01,228
..that when two people meet
on and off, they come close.

1249
02:25:02,051 --> 02:25:05,839
And when friendship grows, one,
tends to take care of each other.

1250
02:25:06,322 --> 02:25:10,747
Even gifts are exchanged.
- He never bought me a gift.

1251
02:25:11,194 --> 02:25:15,267
You've sworn to tell the truth.

1252
02:25:15,865 --> 02:25:18,413
Did he never give you a gift?

1253
02:25:21,805 --> 02:25:25,753
He brought flowers sometimes.
- And this must've continued.

1254
02:25:26,810 --> 02:25:28,311
He must've brought variety
of flowers again and again.

1255
02:25:28,444 --> 02:25:29,433
Objection. Your Honour.

1256
02:25:29,813 --> 02:25:31,804
Such questions have
nothing to do with this case.

1257
02:25:32,415 --> 02:25:33,757
Objection sustained.

1258
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:38,252
Please ask questions
concerning this case.

1259
02:25:38,822 --> 02:25:39,811
All right, sir.

1260
02:25:40,957 --> 02:25:47,749
The night of the fight.
Were you present there? - Yes.

1261
02:25:47,964 --> 02:25:50,114
Then did you see
whatever happened there?

1262
02:25:50,967 --> 02:25:51,956
Yes.

1263
02:25:52,836 --> 02:25:56,226
How did the fight start?
Please tell us in your own words.

1264
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:00,828
l was standing near the
fountain when that idiot came..

1265
02:26:01,044 --> 02:26:04,832
..and began to harass me.
- What happened then?

1266
02:26:05,849 --> 02:26:10,798
Before l could react to it,
Raja came and asked him to leave.

1267
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:13,184
No, he didn't just ask him.

1268
02:26:13,456 --> 02:26:17,961
They fought. Exchanged blows.
There was pandemonium.

1269
02:26:18,094 --> 02:26:19,083
The party was cancelled, it ended.

1270
02:26:19,329 --> 02:26:24,483
Party was ruined. With the accused
threatening the deceased. Yes or no?

1271
02:26:31,341 --> 02:26:34,811
Yes. - Then can l come
to this conclusion..

1272
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:37,869
That the reason and the cause..

1273
02:26:38,014 --> 02:26:39,003
..of this murder is
the closeness and..

1274
02:26:39,148 --> 02:26:40,217
..relationship between
you and Raja?

1275
02:26:40,350 --> 02:26:41,339
Objection, Your Honour.

1276
02:26:41,551 --> 02:26:44,975
My friend is twisting her words
and giving it an incorrect hue.

1277
02:26:45,121 --> 02:26:49,273
l'm not doing that, sir.
l want to prove it to the court..

1278
02:26:49,626 --> 02:26:51,366
..that the murders,
riots and bloodshed..

1279
02:26:51,494 --> 02:26:53,075
..that have occurred till now..

1280
02:26:53,496 --> 02:26:56,442
..are all due to women,
land or alcohol.

1281
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:59,842
This court has also seen
thousands of such cases..

1282
02:27:00,370 --> 02:27:01,519
..in which a woman was
at the root of it all.

1283
02:27:02,171 --> 02:27:06,278
Today too, there is a woman at
the root of the murder committed.

1284
02:27:07,176 --> 02:27:08,325
l see your point.

1285
02:27:08,511 --> 02:27:09,853
Objection overruled..

1286
02:27:10,513 --> 02:27:12,014
Proceed.
- Thank you.

1287
02:27:14,450 --> 02:27:18,841
l will ask you one final question.

1288
02:27:19,989 --> 02:27:23,857
Did you and he ever..forget it.

1289
02:27:23,993 --> 02:27:25,984
l don't wish to upset you
by asking anymore questions.

1290
02:27:26,329 --> 02:27:27,318
Your witness.

1291
02:27:42,679 --> 02:27:43,862
No question..

1292
02:28:07,637 --> 02:28:12,267
Excuse me please. - Yes. - Why
didn't Patel ask her the question?

1293
02:28:12,442 --> 02:28:14,512
Without asking, he proved..

1294
02:28:14,644 --> 02:28:16,111
..something which wouldn't
have been proved by asking.

1295
02:28:16,245 --> 02:28:21,194
Meaning? - He hinted at
a relationship between them..

1296
02:28:21,351 --> 02:28:23,216
..which is better off unexposed.

1297
02:28:38,468 --> 02:28:42,131
Ravi.
- Meena, You?

1298
02:28:43,606 --> 02:28:46,951
l didn't make a mistake, did l?
- What mistake?

1299
02:28:47,677 --> 02:28:49,338
lt won't go against Raja, will it?

1300
02:28:49,479 --> 02:28:53,347
Till now, everything
is against him.

1301
02:28:54,751 --> 02:28:58,335
What now?
- Can't say, Meena.

1302
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:07,684
Who do you think is the killer?
- Only God knows that.

1303
02:29:08,031 --> 02:29:09,100
Or the killer.

1304
02:29:10,033 --> 02:29:11,534
The case is clear, Lawyer.

1305
02:29:12,235 --> 02:29:16,660
lt happened at a party attended
by the elite. They all went away.

1306
02:29:17,507 --> 02:29:22,092
The dinner remained where it was.
l was very sorry. Later, l went too.

1307
02:29:22,378 --> 02:29:24,278
Then who informed
you about the murder?

1308
02:29:24,647 --> 02:29:25,636
My driver.

1309
02:29:26,315 --> 02:29:31,469
l was sleeping and he woke me up.
He then told me about it.

1310
02:29:31,721 --> 02:29:34,986
Then?
- l didn't believe it first.

1311
02:29:35,324 --> 02:29:39,715
Raja is a good man.
l know him well.

1312
02:29:40,263 --> 02:29:45,417
l've brought him up.
- No opinions.

1313
02:29:45,802 --> 02:29:48,111
Just say things
concerning this case.

1314
02:29:49,472 --> 02:29:52,373
When your driver woke you,
what did you do?

1315
02:29:52,675 --> 02:29:56,384
l came out and went towards
Raja's room with the driver?

1316
02:29:56,679 --> 02:29:57,703
And what you saw there?

1317
02:29:59,082 --> 02:30:04,031
Raja was holding Balbir's body and
was trying to put it in the closet.

1318
02:30:04,487 --> 02:30:08,275
Can you recognise the closet?
- Yes. There it is.

1319
02:30:09,292 --> 02:30:13,035
Then what?
- l did my duty.

1320
02:30:13,362 --> 02:30:17,025
l locked the door
and phoned the police.

1321
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:19,001
What happened then?

1322
02:30:19,502 --> 02:30:24,053
l opened the door,
but Raja was missing.

1323
02:30:24,373 --> 02:30:26,034
And the window was open?
- Yes, sir.

1324
02:30:26,709 --> 02:30:28,529
Thank you, Mr. Chinoy.
Your witness.

1325
02:30:33,116 --> 02:30:37,268
l don't wish to question him now,
but l'll request the court..

1326
02:30:38,121 --> 02:30:41,591
..that if l need to, l'll call
Mr. Chinoy again for question.

1327
02:30:42,325 --> 02:30:43,394
Permission granted.

1328
02:30:44,127 --> 02:30:45,469
Please, note it.

1329
02:30:46,129 --> 02:30:47,118
Thank you.

1330
02:30:53,402 --> 02:30:57,304
Had you seen the
accused before anywhere?

1331
02:30:59,142 --> 02:31:01,087
Yes.
- Where?

1332
02:31:02,612 --> 02:31:07,083
He was running on the
road and l caught him.

1333
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:08,374
Why?

1334
02:31:09,819 --> 02:31:14,813
He was so petrified and had l not
caught him, he'd have been run over.

1335
02:31:15,158 --> 02:31:17,661
When you caught him,
what did he say?

1336
02:31:18,895 --> 02:31:20,795
He was trying to free himself.

1337
02:31:21,430 --> 02:31:27,096
Said, ''Let me go''. Just then the
police came and took him away.

1338
02:31:27,770 --> 02:31:28,759
Thank you very much.

1339
02:31:28,905 --> 02:31:33,410
Your witness. Your witness,
Mr. Ravi.

1340
02:31:51,794 --> 02:31:52,783
No questions.

1341
02:31:57,800 --> 02:32:02,146
Now, l'll present a witness
who has seen many things.

1342
02:32:02,271 --> 02:32:07,140
A final link, so to say.
Mr. Vijay Kumar, please.

1343
02:32:07,476 --> 02:32:09,296
Mr. Vijay Kumar..

1344
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:14,142
Mr. Vijay may be present.

1345
02:32:27,230 --> 02:32:29,778
Say, ''l'll tell the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.''

1346
02:32:33,703 --> 02:32:38,174
''l'll tell the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.''

1347
02:32:38,441 --> 02:32:42,309
What do you do for a living?
- l'm Mr. Chinoy's driver.

1348
02:32:42,445 --> 02:32:48,190
Were you on duty at the party?
- No. My mother was seriously ill.

1349
02:32:48,517 --> 02:32:51,702
l had asked sir for the car and
taken my mother to the doctor.

1350
02:32:51,988 --> 02:32:56,220
Later.
- Later l brought back the car.

1351
02:32:57,660 --> 02:33:00,208
l put on the headlights and saw..

1352
02:33:00,863 --> 02:33:05,414
..a man dragging a body.
- Did you recognise the body?

1353
02:33:06,269 --> 02:33:08,453
Yes. lt was Balbir.

1354
02:33:09,405 --> 02:33:12,875
Then you must've
known the other man too.

1355
02:33:13,676 --> 02:33:17,419
Yes.
- ls he in the court now?

1356
02:33:20,316 --> 02:33:22,261
Yes.
- Who is that man?

1357
02:33:24,287 --> 02:33:25,276
Him.

1358
02:33:26,756 --> 02:33:29,384
Thank you, Mr. Vijay Kumar.
Your witness.

1359
02:33:35,765 --> 02:33:39,314
You're a driver?
- Do you mind?

1360
02:33:41,704 --> 02:33:44,252
Easy. l don't mind at all.

1361
02:33:44,573 --> 02:33:50,887
What l meant was, you're a B.A.
And you work as a driver.

1362
02:33:51,380 --> 02:33:57,250
l drive. Not beg around.
- Sorry. You seem offended.

1363
02:33:57,520 --> 02:34:02,753
l mean you must be in dire
straits to accept this job.

1364
02:34:03,059 --> 02:34:05,368
l'm not brought here
because of my personal problems.

1365
02:34:05,494 --> 02:34:08,804
Please answer him properly.

1366
02:34:11,334 --> 02:34:15,964
l ask you, why you took
up this job as a driver.

1367
02:34:16,939 --> 02:34:21,729
My mother's sick and l didn't get
any other job. So, l took this one.

1368
02:34:22,411 --> 02:34:24,914
So, you did all this for your mom?

1369
02:34:25,881 --> 02:34:30,272
Yes. - What is she
suffering from? - Cancer.

1370
02:34:30,753 --> 02:34:32,857
Oh, l am sorry.

1371
02:34:34,090 --> 02:34:38,402
Then it's a question of her life.
- Yes.

1372
02:34:39,362 --> 02:34:42,513
You'll do anything for her.

1373
02:34:45,368 --> 02:34:50,556
Yes.
- How fate plays with men.

1374
02:34:51,640 --> 02:34:52,709
Here is an unfortunate man..

1375
02:34:52,842 --> 02:34:55,310
..who doesn't have a mother
to cry for him.

1376
02:34:55,911 --> 02:34:59,699
And here stands Vijay who
can be the pride of any mother.

1377
02:35:00,516 --> 02:35:06,307
l'm proud of my son. He'll never
lie in a court. l know him well.

1378
02:35:06,589 --> 02:35:08,329
He's my flesh and blood. My son.

1379
02:35:08,657 --> 02:35:10,318
That man's also somebody's son.

1380
02:35:10,860 --> 02:35:16,651
One who's standing in the dock.
l know him well too. He can't kill.

1381
02:35:16,999 --> 02:35:21,550
He's absolutely innocent. Then why
is your son talking against him?

1382
02:35:22,671 --> 02:35:27,335
l don't know, but l hope he won't
sacrifice another mother's son..

1383
02:35:27,476 --> 02:35:30,343
..to save his own mother.

1384
02:35:33,416 --> 02:35:35,839
That's all. l'll go now.

1385
02:35:36,819 --> 02:35:37,808
Greetings.

1386
02:35:48,831 --> 02:35:49,820
Mom..

1387
02:35:51,901 --> 02:35:53,050
You're home?

1388
02:35:53,969 --> 02:35:58,838
Yes. How are you?
- All right, l suppose.

1389
02:35:59,108 --> 02:36:01,372
Don't worry.
l spoke to the doctor.

1390
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:04,377
He said you should
get operated soon.

1391
02:36:05,047 --> 02:36:11,395
But one needs money, Son.
- l've got the money. Here you are.

1392
02:36:15,724 --> 02:36:19,911
What's the matter?
- Where did you get this from?

1393
02:36:21,464 --> 02:36:26,891
l've borrowed it from my boss.
He'll cut it from my pay.

1394
02:36:27,870 --> 02:36:31,772
He gave it in a lump-sum?
- So what? He has loaned it to me.

1395
02:36:32,875 --> 02:36:38,666
l've not robbed anyone.
- lf you're saving my life and..

1396
02:36:38,814 --> 02:36:43,126
..sacrificing someone else's,
it's better that l die.

1397
02:36:45,020 --> 02:36:46,760
l hear you're standing as
a witness against somebody.

1398
02:36:49,091 --> 02:36:51,434
God forbid, but to save me,
l hope you don't deprive..

1399
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:53,460
..another mother of a son.

1400
02:36:54,497 --> 02:36:56,727
He's also somebody's brother,
and a son.

1401
02:36:57,099 --> 02:37:02,048
Look, he's also a brother, son,
a dear one to someone.

1402
02:37:02,505 --> 02:37:05,690
Your statement can hang him.

1403
02:37:06,108 --> 02:37:09,100
You're the only eyewitness.

1404
02:37:09,578 --> 02:37:12,968
What did you see?
Someone dragging a body?

1405
02:37:13,115 --> 02:37:14,104
He must be covering the body.

1406
02:37:14,250 --> 02:37:18,994
What did you see? His waist,
neck, face? Why don't you tell us?

1407
02:37:19,121 --> 02:37:22,511
l say you saw nothing. You're lying.
lf you saw someone with a body..

1408
02:37:22,625 --> 02:37:24,968
..why didn't you shout, make noise?
And catch the killer?

1409
02:37:26,128 --> 02:37:32,476
lf what you saw is the truth,
then it'll be justice to hang him.

1410
02:37:33,536 --> 02:37:37,438
But if it's a lie and you don't
admit it to it in the court now..

1411
02:37:37,673 --> 02:37:42,622
it'll be murder. And you'll be
responsible for that murder.

1412
02:37:43,145 --> 02:37:47,138
Swear on this Holy Gita (holy text).
ls this the man you saw that night?

1413
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:55,613
..that this is the man you saw.
Why are you not saying anything?

1414
02:37:55,758 --> 02:37:57,658
You lied. You lied under oath.

1415
02:37:58,627 --> 02:38:00,128
lf injustice is done to this man..

1416
02:38:00,296 --> 02:38:01,763
God will make you pay for it.

1417
02:38:03,032 --> 02:38:07,537
Your mother is ill, very ill.

1418
02:38:08,304 --> 02:38:12,491
She may have to die for your crime.
- No.

1419
02:38:14,577 --> 02:38:19,765
No. l had lied. l gave a
false statement. l lied, lied..

1420
02:38:19,915 --> 02:38:24,500
Why? What was the temptation?
- l was given money.

1421
02:38:24,653 --> 02:38:28,965
By whom?
- Mr. Chinoy. - Mr. Chinoy.

1422
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:37,209
Order, order.
- Your Honour.

1423
02:38:37,866 --> 02:38:42,656
You cannot believe this witness.
Did he lie yesterday or today?

1424
02:38:42,805 --> 02:38:46,548
Was he given the money before or
today, one can't really prove.

1425
02:38:47,610 --> 02:38:53,799
l agree with my friend, sir.
lt's obvious this man had lied.

1426
02:38:54,883 --> 02:39:02,836
Now that the eyewitness has been
proved a liar, the matter is closed.

1427
02:39:03,626 --> 02:39:07,528
lndeed it is. The fact that
this man's footprints were found..

1428
02:39:07,696 --> 02:39:11,564
..in the blood is useless.
Someone saw him put the body..

1429
02:39:11,700 --> 02:39:15,568
..in the cupboard, is of no value.
That police caught him running..

1430
02:39:15,704 --> 02:39:19,572
..is also to go unnoticed.
lt is strange that my friend here..

1431
02:39:19,708 --> 02:39:23,781
..is fighting a case and
taking a decision too.

1432
02:39:24,179 --> 02:39:28,127
Before l present anything more, l'd
like the court to grant me a break.

1433
02:39:28,717 --> 02:39:30,582
Permitted.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1434
02:40:33,716 --> 02:40:39,905
What farce is this?
- Sorry. But l'm trying my best..

1435
02:40:40,022 --> 02:40:43,651
..to get my footprints on the path
that l've dragged this sack on.

1436
02:40:44,126 --> 02:40:48,074
But l'm unsuccessful. lf my
learned friend is willing to try..

1437
02:40:48,931 --> 02:40:50,000
..he may be successful.

1438
02:40:50,733 --> 02:40:52,678
Mr. Patel, try it.

1439
02:41:06,148 --> 02:41:11,381
l leave the decision about
the footprints to the Court.

1440
02:41:14,757 --> 02:41:18,306
Let me say what my learned
friend is scared to say.

1441
02:41:18,761 --> 02:41:19,910
There won't be any footprints.

1442
02:41:21,830 --> 02:41:25,334
Take this sack to be the body and..

1443
02:41:25,467 --> 02:41:28,413
..the red paint as the spilt blood,
which was on the carpet..

1444
02:41:28,771 --> 02:41:30,113
..while pulling the corpse.

1445
02:41:30,973 --> 02:41:36,798
l wanted to show that no
matter how the body was dragged..

1446
02:41:37,279 --> 02:41:40,703
..the footprints will not
fall on the blood. This means..

1447
02:41:40,849 --> 02:41:43,716
..my client couldn't have left
his footprints in the blood..

1448
02:41:43,852 --> 02:41:46,434
..when the body was being dragged.

1449
02:41:46,789 --> 02:41:48,256
The prints came later.
The body first.

1450
02:41:54,797 --> 02:41:55,980
Order. Order.

1451
02:41:57,065 --> 02:42:01,889
The Court wants to know whether
there was light at the scene?

1452
02:42:03,205 --> 02:42:05,355
According to the police report,
it was dark, sir.

1453
02:42:07,009 --> 02:42:07,998
Proceed, Mr. Khanna.

1454
02:42:08,343 --> 02:42:13,212
l'm not just thankful but also
grateful to the court for clearing..

1455
02:42:13,348 --> 02:42:14,975
..the fact that when my client
came on the scene, it was dark.

1456
02:42:15,350 --> 02:42:20,458
This also proves that as he walked,
he didn't know there was blood.

1457
02:42:22,090 --> 02:42:27,995
To make all this clearer, l'll now
ask Mr. Chinoy to take the stand.

1458
02:42:29,231 --> 02:42:30,220
Mr. Chinoy.

1459
02:42:45,247 --> 02:42:47,989
Sorry to have called you again.

1460
02:42:48,851 --> 02:42:52,241
Nothing serious. l just
want to clear a few points.

1461
02:42:53,589 --> 02:42:54,772
But of course.

1462
02:42:55,057 --> 02:42:57,844
Your driver's statement
has proved to be a lie.

1463
02:42:58,460 --> 02:43:00,928
Tell me, how did you reach
the room of the accused?

1464
02:43:02,998 --> 02:43:07,788
You forget, but l've already
stated that my driver woke me up.

1465
02:43:08,070 --> 02:43:11,460
Really? Yes, you were asleep.

1466
02:43:11,874 --> 02:43:17,346
So, what happened then?
- l was shocked.

1467
02:43:17,880 --> 02:43:19,381
l left with the driver immediately.

1468
02:43:19,882 --> 02:43:23,955
You must have worn your trousers,
your shirt and a coat..

1469
02:43:24,086 --> 02:43:27,476
..all that must have
taken at least ten minutes?

1470
02:43:27,890 --> 02:43:30,438
No, it didn't take time.
l left immediately.

1471
02:43:30,893 --> 02:43:34,477
Records show that you
were in the same clothes..

1472
02:43:34,630 --> 02:43:36,814
..which you had worn
at the party that night.

1473
02:43:37,900 --> 02:43:44,897
Do you sleep in the clothes
you wear outside during that day?

1474
02:43:45,307 --> 02:43:50,859
No. Like all decent men,
l change for the night.

1475
02:43:52,047 --> 02:43:54,834
l have already stated
what happened that night.

1476
02:43:55,183 --> 02:43:58,209
The party had broken up.
All the guests had left.

1477
02:43:58,921 --> 02:44:03,073
lt was humiliating.
ln a depression, l went home..

1478
02:44:03,926 --> 02:44:06,918
..and lay down on the bed
and drifted into sleep.

1479
02:44:07,462 --> 02:44:08,929
Under the circumstances..

1480
02:44:09,064 --> 02:44:11,851
..it didn't occur to me to change.
l fell asleep.

1481
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:12,989
Fantastic, Mr. Chinoy.

1482
02:44:13,936 --> 02:44:14,925
You've already said in your..

1483
02:44:15,070 --> 02:44:17,140
..testimony that when
you went to Raja's room..

1484
02:44:17,539 --> 02:44:20,884
..you saw that Raja was trying
to put the body into the cupboard.

1485
02:44:21,410 --> 02:44:22,877
Yes.
- Did you see clearly..

1486
02:44:23,011 --> 02:44:27,004
..that he was putting the body
inside? - Yes, very clearly..

1487
02:44:28,016 --> 02:44:29,517
The lights were on.
- lndeed, the lights were on.

1488
02:44:29,952 --> 02:44:32,898
Obviously, you will see everything
clearly in when the lights are on.

1489
02:44:33,021 --> 02:44:35,888
How about the door?
- The door.. - Sorry,

1490
02:44:36,024 --> 02:44:39,972
l forgot again what you said.
The door was open.

1491
02:44:40,295 --> 02:44:45,085
l ask because, when the
body was being placed there..

1492
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:46,622
..how were things placed
in the room?

1493
02:44:46,969 --> 02:44:47,958
l mean, how much open was the..

1494
02:44:48,103 --> 02:44:52,528
..cupboard? How far was
Raja from the cupboard?

1495
02:44:52,674 --> 02:44:56,906
How was he standing, and how was
he carrying the body in his arms?

1496
02:44:57,245 --> 02:44:59,634
Could you demonstrate all
that before a cupboard? - What?

1497
02:45:00,515 --> 02:45:02,904
With your permission Your Honour.
- Permission granted.

1498
02:45:03,585 --> 02:45:04,574
This way, Mr. Chinoy

1499
02:45:16,264 --> 02:45:20,132
Raja came like this to
stand near the cupboard.

1500
02:45:21,003 --> 02:45:26,953
And he carried the body
in his arms like this..

1501
02:45:27,075 --> 02:45:29,942
And the cupboard was shut.
- l said, it was open.

1502
02:45:30,278 --> 02:45:31,267
Look..

1503
02:45:33,015 --> 02:45:35,961
What's this? - This is
just what l'm trying to say.

1504
02:45:36,084 --> 02:45:39,952
The body was perhaps already in the
cupboard. And when Raja opened it..

1505
02:45:40,088 --> 02:45:43,592
..the body fell on Raja just as
the mannequin fell on Mr. Chinoy.

1506
02:45:46,028 --> 02:45:47,017
Thank you..

1507
02:45:47,629 --> 02:45:48,618
You may return to the witness box.

1508
02:46:03,045 --> 02:46:06,629
When you got there, seeing
the body in Raja's arms..

1509
02:46:06,782 --> 02:46:09,250
..which could've fallen from
the closet, what did you do?

1510
02:46:09,584 --> 02:46:14,658
l locked the door from outside.
- Which was open from the inside?

1511
02:46:17,125 --> 02:46:18,114
Yes.

1512
02:46:20,595 --> 02:46:24,338
When the driver woke you and
told you about the murder..

1513
02:46:24,533 --> 02:46:27,525
..was there anybody else
besides the two of you?

1514
02:46:27,669 --> 02:46:29,011
No.
- And when you went towards..

1515
02:46:29,137 --> 02:46:31,002
..the accuser's room, that time..

1516
02:46:31,139 --> 02:46:34,006
Why is he stressing this..
- Listen to me, first.

1517
02:46:34,609 --> 02:46:39,000
Answer my question. When you
saw Raja putting the corpse in..

1518
02:46:39,347 --> 02:46:42,293
..was the driver with you?
- Yes.

1519
02:46:42,417 --> 02:46:45,124
This means, my dear sir, your
statement, whether true or false..

1520
02:46:45,253 --> 02:46:47,357
..depends on the man who
himself has been proved..

1521
02:46:47,489 --> 02:46:48,638
..a liar in this court.

1522
02:46:49,491 --> 02:46:54,394
Before l sound off, l want the
jury to consider just three things.

1523
02:46:55,163 --> 02:46:59,031
One, my client didn't
know there was blood..

1524
02:46:59,167 --> 02:47:01,067
..when he walked up the path.

1525
02:47:01,369 --> 02:47:06,159
Two, when he opened the closet, he
didn't know there was a body in it.

1526
02:47:06,508 --> 02:47:08,009
Three, when he got scared..

1527
02:47:08,176 --> 02:47:10,360
..seeing the corpse, and
finding the door locked..

1528
02:47:10,512 --> 02:47:11,661
..he escaped from the window..

1529
02:47:11,780 --> 02:47:14,362
..not knowing this act
will go against him.

1530
02:47:15,550 --> 02:47:16,539
With these facts..

1531
02:47:16,685 --> 02:47:20,269
..no court of law, or society,
can find my client guilty.

1532
02:47:21,656 --> 02:47:27,049
But there has been a murder,
and so, there must be a killer.

1533
02:47:27,729 --> 02:47:33,395
Only two men can be the killer.
Men who had the chance to do it.

1534
02:47:44,679 --> 02:47:49,309
My apologies. Now, there can
be only one killer, not two.

1535
02:47:50,152 --> 02:47:51,335
And that man is Mr. Chinoy.

1536
02:47:52,754 --> 02:47:53,778
l object, Your Honour.

1537
02:47:54,156 --> 02:47:56,181
He cannot be the accused.

1538
02:47:56,424 --> 02:47:59,086
He's in the witness box,
not in the dock.

1539
02:47:59,561 --> 02:48:05,272
lt's not my fault, but he should
be in the dock. That's because..

1540
02:48:05,400 --> 02:48:09,302
l've got such proof that can
turn all doubts into facts.

1541
02:48:09,771 --> 02:48:14,356
The thing which was obscure,
has suddenly come to light.

1542
02:48:14,776 --> 02:48:19,520
Every man in this court
will be shocked to know..

1543
02:48:19,648 --> 02:48:25,120
..that what l have
is the murder weapon.

1544
02:48:25,253 --> 02:48:27,801
That knife which took
Balbir Singh's life.

1545
02:48:28,190 --> 02:48:30,613
And on which,
Mr. Chinoy's name is engraved.

1546
02:48:30,759 --> 02:48:32,101
That's a lie.

1547
02:48:32,260 --> 02:48:35,411
l say your name is on it.
- And l say it can't be.

1548
02:48:35,564 --> 02:48:36,553
Why not?

1549
02:48:36,698 --> 02:48:40,646
Why not? Balbir was
killed with your knife..

1550
02:48:40,802 --> 02:48:43,350
No. He wasn't killed by my knife,
but his.. - Mr. Chinoy.

1551
02:48:45,207 --> 02:48:49,109
Say he died with his own knife.
Tell the court you know this.

1552
02:48:49,277 --> 02:48:50,266
You know this because you..

1553
02:48:50,412 --> 02:48:53,154
..were not asleep,
and the driver never woke you.

1554
02:48:53,281 --> 02:48:58,150
You dragged the body. You kept it
in the closet. The driver saw you.

1555
02:48:58,420 --> 02:49:02,493
You bought him. You killed Balbir.
You are the murderer. You.

1556
02:49:04,226 --> 02:49:06,171
Ravi.
- Arrest this man.

1557
02:49:06,361 --> 02:49:07,350
What madness is this?

1558
02:49:17,772 --> 02:49:23,165
This is not the murder weapon.
lt's a toy knife.

1559
02:49:24,713 --> 02:49:28,262
l had no other choice
to prove my point.

1560
02:49:39,261 --> 02:49:46,656
This Court orders Mr. Chinoy
be tried for Balbir's murder.

1561
02:49:47,669 --> 02:49:49,773
And acquits Mr. Raja as a free man.

1562
02:50:22,304 --> 02:50:24,852
Forgive me, Son.

1563
02:50:25,440 --> 02:50:29,388
By saving him, you've saved
me from committing a sin too.

1564
02:50:29,844 --> 02:50:32,233
l nearly got him hanged.

1565
02:50:34,716 --> 02:50:37,867
May God bless you. Good show.

1566
02:50:52,334 --> 02:50:53,961
Vijay.
- Mother.

1567
02:50:54,736 --> 02:50:59,287
What happened, Son?
- God saved me from hell.

1568
02:50:59,407 --> 02:51:01,796
Thank God.
- He's a free man.

1569
02:51:04,079 --> 02:51:10,268
Son, what he did was for me.

1570
02:51:10,819 --> 02:51:13,287
l'm the guilty one. Forgive me.

1571
02:51:13,421 --> 02:51:15,571
What nonsense!
You're like a mother to me.

1572
02:51:16,358 --> 02:51:17,939
lf that's true, then consider..

1573
02:51:18,093 --> 02:51:19,958
..him your younger brother
and forgive him.

1574
02:51:20,362 --> 02:51:21,863
l've nothing against him.
Come here.

1575
02:51:26,501 --> 02:51:30,926
Laxmi..Laxmi..

1576
02:51:33,508 --> 02:51:34,497
Laxmi.

1577
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:02,349
Lala.. - Laxmi..
- Lala. - Laxmi.

1578
02:52:05,006 --> 02:52:06,951
Laxmi.

1579
02:52:11,146 --> 02:52:12,329
Don't cry, Laxmi.

1580
02:52:15,417 --> 02:52:16,406
Mother..

1581
02:52:17,685 --> 02:52:23,351
This is your youngest, Munna.
- Munna? My dear son.

1582
02:52:24,426 --> 02:52:26,576
l had gone mad.

1583
02:52:28,430 --> 02:52:31,740
Why is destiny suddenly good to me?

1584
02:52:32,901 --> 02:52:35,369
She gave me so much joy,
l can't even bear it.

1585
02:52:37,705 --> 02:52:40,697
Laxmi, after being separated
from you all..

1586
02:52:40,842 --> 02:52:42,992
..l went through such hard times.

1587
02:52:43,845 --> 02:52:49,590
No news about you and the boys.
Life had become a burden.

1588
02:52:51,719 --> 02:52:54,426
l carried my own
corpse on my shoulders.

1589
02:52:57,525 --> 02:52:58,514
Laxmi.

1590
02:52:59,461 --> 02:53:06,890
Do you know, once l
nearly found my Raju. - Where?

1591
02:53:07,936 --> 02:53:09,403
Long ago now.

1592
02:53:10,872 --> 02:53:17,061
l heard he was in an orphanage.
But he had gone before l got there.

1593
02:53:18,947 --> 02:53:24,135
l died that very moment.
But l lived on this hope..

1594
02:53:25,086 --> 02:53:27,429
..that somewhere, sometime..

1595
02:53:28,556 --> 02:53:34,631
l'll find you all.
Today, l found you all.

1596
02:53:34,896 --> 02:53:39,640
Laxmi, today's my re-birth.

1597
02:53:43,171 --> 02:53:49,724
You're crying, Raja?

1598
02:53:51,646 --> 02:53:55,798
Why?
- You won't understand.

1599
02:53:56,518 --> 02:53:58,179
Ravi, you won't understand.

1600
02:53:58,520 --> 02:54:06,837
What l'm seeing now is very
hard to put in words. Too hard.

1601
02:54:07,128 --> 02:54:13,203
Look what a strapping
young man my Munna has become.

1602
02:54:13,668 --> 02:54:17,820
Son, if your brothers
were here today..

1603
02:54:17,939 --> 02:54:20,089
..they'd have been like you too.

1604
02:54:20,675 --> 02:54:25,465
Suppose.. l unite you..

1605
02:54:25,613 --> 02:54:30,482
..with Babloo and Raju?

1606
02:54:30,618 --> 02:54:35,169
What?! l'll shower you with pearls..
l'll be your slave for life..

1607
02:54:35,290 --> 02:54:40,080
l'll die for you. Where are they?
- You won't believe me.

1608
02:54:40,194 --> 02:54:43,504
l will. l will believe you.
- You will? - Yes.

1609
02:54:44,632 --> 02:54:51,504
Then, this is Babloo and l'm Raju.
- He's Babloo..

1610
02:54:52,574 --> 02:54:56,920
You're Raju? Are you Babloo?
You are Raju.

1611
02:54:57,979 --> 02:55:03,531
Laxmi.
- Babloo, Raju, Munna.

1612
02:55:09,857 --> 02:55:15,853
Oh, God. You've given
back my world to me.

1613
02:55:17,332 --> 02:55:19,516
Now, l've no complaints.

1614
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:28,525
Meena's mother has
come to congratulate you.

1615
02:55:29,344 --> 02:55:32,529
No. l've come to apologise.

1616
02:55:33,615 --> 02:55:36,038
A promising son doesn't
need his parents name.

1617
02:55:36,818 --> 02:55:39,560
ln fact, he makes them famous.

1618
02:55:39,687 --> 02:55:41,791
What are you saying?

1619
02:55:48,029 --> 02:55:50,054
Brother.
- Renu.

1620
02:55:52,300 --> 02:55:54,564
Father, this is my
crazy sister Renu.

1621
02:55:55,036 --> 02:55:59,302
And these are my
parents who brought me up.

1622
02:56:00,041 --> 02:56:05,195
And..and..this is my charming
beautiful darling Meena.

1623
02:56:05,847 --> 02:56:08,589
Very mischievous.
- Meet your daughter-in-law, Mom.

1624
02:56:10,184 --> 02:56:11,572
Renu..

1625
02:56:12,854 --> 02:56:18,201
She's beautiful, isn't she, Raju?
- Yes, else how'd your son like her?

1626
02:56:19,927 --> 02:56:23,590
lt's as though nothing happened.

1627
02:56:25,066 --> 02:56:29,617
Before one passes it, time
seems to drag. To go on forever.

1628
02:56:30,672 --> 02:56:35,666
But once it passes, centuries
seem moments. Like seeing a dream.

1629
02:56:37,278 --> 02:56:41,180
Today, it's the same me
and the same business.

1630
02:56:41,416 --> 02:56:43,156
This is nothing.

1631
02:56:43,685 --> 02:56:46,347
Look how we three brothers
turn this into a grand thing.

1632
02:56:46,688 --> 02:56:48,269
We'll be the best.

1633
02:56:48,423 --> 02:56:53,087
No, Son. Don't say that.
l had once said that..

1634
02:56:54,295 --> 02:56:59,688
..and time slapped me hard.
lt scattered my entire family.

1635
02:57:01,703 --> 02:57:08,893
lt has united us all again. Why?
To show that time is everything.

1636
02:57:10,378 --> 02:57:13,643
Time makes, and time breaks.

1637
02:57:13,915 --> 02:57:17,908
God has changed our days again.

1638
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:20,745
Whatever God took from us..

1639
02:57:20,888 --> 02:57:22,628
..He returned it to
us with interest.

1640
02:57:22,790 --> 02:57:24,098
Sons, with daughters-in-law.

1641
02:57:27,261 --> 02:57:28,649
Where are daughters-in-law?

1642
02:57:30,131 --> 02:57:32,713
Let's start the rites,
sir. Please, come.

1643
02:57:33,735 --> 02:57:38,126
Bless you, my dear. - Bless you,
my dear. Bless you, my dear.

1644
02:57:38,940 --> 02:57:40,805
Okay, Priest. Start the rites.
