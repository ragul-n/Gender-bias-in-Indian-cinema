This drama has been

Neither is he sleeping
nor is he letting us sleep.

165
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,249
Whenever he dries a little he
wets himself again with petrol.

166
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,290

00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,999
That day will never
come in my life.

And there are hardly
any days left in my life.

183

Okay, tell me, how

She will change him for good.

319
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,499
She didn't bring any bags with her.

320
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,999
What was the need to
bring any luggage?

321
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,332
l'm not staying in a hotel.
l'm staying with my in-laws.

322
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,707
There is anything lacking in here?

323
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,332
Yes, only that like
yöu was lacking. That..

324
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,040

<font color="#808080">-</font> What do yöu call a son's that?

325
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,457
Daughter-in-law.

only lacking a daughter-in-law..

326
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,207
.. and now yöur presence
has changed that as well.

327
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,040
yöur father has become that.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mad?

328
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:18,999
Should l tell yöur father?

329
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,457
yöu are saying such things
about my elder brother? Yes?

330
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,374
Tell us, when are yöu
going for the wedding?

331
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,707
l just ran from a wedding.

332
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,040
yöu ran away from it?

333
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,999
But yöu were going to Phuket
for yöur friend's wedding, right?

334
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,249
Yes, l was going to.

What do yöu mean, "l was going to?"

336
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,915
lf yöu didn't go there then
how did yöu ran away from it?

337
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,999
By ran away l mean l got rid
of it with great difficulty.

338
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,124
Why would l unnecessarily
waste my time in Phuket?

339
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,749
That's right. Why
waste time in Phuket?

340
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,665
lf l would attend my
friend's wedding..

341
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,499
.. then how would l make
arrangements for my wedding?

342
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,415
And l have to fulfil the
responsibility Guru has given me.

343
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,915
She will marry yöu.
She is wishful-serpent.

344
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,957
l will never let her wish come true.

345
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,582
Sir, Pooja's on the line.

My friend. The one

353
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,457
She is very angry.

354
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,374
Anyway, look, l am waiting

355

357
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,165
lf yöu don't believe me

Tell her that we don't have a car.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, we have a car.

And l'll go to Guru's
ashram after 8-10 days.

371

Come, Pooja, l'll take

Until we get married, Prem

380
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,499
Yes.

381
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,207
Don't worry about him. He
can also sleep on a table.

Look, he is sleeping.

383
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,082

Where did she go?

403
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,999

Someone stop me.

She is one piece from head to toe.

How do l cut her into pieces?

412
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,540

But what will yöu

421
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:53,540
The CEO of fools, l won't

Right, brother?

471
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,290
Yes. 'Ladoos'. We will distribute
'Ladoo'. We will distribute 'Ladoos'.

472
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,707
Yes, they are round as well.

473
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,999
The world is also round. Should
we distribute that?
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, no, no.

474
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,124
What kind of people there
are in the world, uncle.

475
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:52,415
Of different types.

476
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,165
They neither pray in the
morning nor go to work.

477
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,374
Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> True, dear. There
are such people as well.

478
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,790
What times have come!

479
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:01,207
There's a demon
staying in a God's house.

480
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,207
l'll have to use my demonic mind.

481
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,790
Uncle.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What happened?

482
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:16,082
What happened?

483
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:19,707
What happened?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Nothing. lt's a small injury.

484
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:21,915
Should l seek revenge? Here yöu go.

485
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,957
Mother Earth. Bad mummy.

486
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,082
Bad mummy, Mother Earth.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Sorry, uncle.

487
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,540
He was trying to make me
fall but yöu fell instead.

488
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:29,332
But why was he
trying to make yöu fall?

489
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:31,582
Anger. l said a few true
things and he got angry.

490
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,915
He got irritated.

491
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,165
Why get irritated with it?
She is telling the truth.

492
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,124
He is always either on
his bike or his skates.

493
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,665
Otherwise he keeps building
his body in the spare time.

494
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,832
Why are yöu ruining my healthy body?

495
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,082
Everyone is saying
something or the other..

496
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,332
.. don't yöu have to say something?

497
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:49,207
God sent him here to
increase the burden on earth.

498
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:50,457
yöu are telling the
truth for the first time.

499
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:52,582
We have been given a life..

500
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,749
.. only so that he can disgrace us.

501
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,165
Absolutely right.
<font color="#808080">-</font> He is a big disgrace.

502
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,499
yöu have a great
sense of honour, uncle.

503
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,374
Even a Satan will look
like a God in front of him.

504
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:02,999
Great.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Wonderful.

505
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:07,415
He is..
<font color="#808080">-</font> l think l'll have to
tell aunt about yöur affair, uncle.

506
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,707
l'm not saying it from my heart.
Don't take it to yöur heart.

507
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:11,415
My hand broke.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Be careful.
Be careful. Be careful.

508
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,582
Take me to a hospital.
<font color="#808080">-</font> We'll
have to do something about her.

509
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,374
She's digging a grave for yöu.

510
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,124
What happened?
<font color="#808080">-</font> l cannot move it.

511
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,915
l'll handle her.

512
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:26,374
Because uncle, once
she is gone, life is fun.

513
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,332
Great, Pooja. Great.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Enough.

514
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,790
lt is delicious.

Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> And she sings so well.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

517
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,249
And she is also changing our
spoilt brat for good.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

518
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,749
Look, he is here.

519
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:43,374
Son, yöur name is Prem (love)
and not 'Hatred'. Right?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Really?

520
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,999
Hey, listen. Hello.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Sit.

521
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,290
Madam, go. Go to
the airport. Come on.

522
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,957
Why?
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöur father has
sent a parcel for yöu.

523

From USA.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, so why
are yöu giving me the news?

524
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,832
yöu should have collected it for me.

525
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,124
He is useless.

526
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,749
yöu sing so well. yöu cook so well.

527
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,707
What would have happened if
yöu had studied a little as well?

528
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:06,082
The officer there won't give the
parcel to me without yöur signature.

529
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,332
yöu only will have to go there.

530
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:10,749
How will the poor girl go to
airport alone? yöu go with her, Prem.

531
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,624
Am l her driver,
chauffer or servant?

532

Brother.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Prem, yöu go with her.

But still, yöu

535
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:23,915
Yes, but dad didn't
inform me over the phone.

536
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,332
Oh, fax.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

537
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,249
He has sent a fax, yöu dirty mind.

538

Why are yöu fasting
time talking, Prem?

539
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,707
The parcel will go back.
Come on, leave. Go.

540
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:33,540
Please go, son.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Let's go.

Be careful. l think
he's up to something.

543

l have a mobile. l'll
call if anything happens.

544
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,832
Only if he will let yöu call.

545
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,249
'l could've easily spent
10-12 days in this house..'

546
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,082
'..if he wouldn't
have been born here.'

547
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,374
'She has made my family
crazy about her in two days.'

548
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:57,249
'l would be dead if she
would stay for 12 days.'

'He cannot stop taking advantage.'

550
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,457
'We take advantage of those
we would gain something from.'

551

'l am just trying
to get rid of her.'

552
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,165
'Airport is on the left and
he is taking a right turn.'

553
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,915
'ls he planning to take
me to the jungle and..'

554
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,415
'No, madam. lf l
do any such thing..'

555
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,374
'..then l'll get
stuck with yöu forever.'

556
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,457
'Then l will have to marry yöu.'

557
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,832
'Then why is he
taking me to a jungle?'

558
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:32,332
'Will he leave me
amidst wild animals?'

559

'l would have if l wasn't so
concerned about the poor animals.'

'l think l'll have to
show her a few lions.'

561
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,582
How can yöu even
think of such a thing?

562
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,332
What are yöu doing?

563

The steering wheel got locked.
Why did yöu throw it?

00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,957
Are yöu a woman or what?

566

..then yöu should have kept
the keys here, like a woman.

00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,957
Keys are not kept there.
Keys are kept around the waist.

569
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,207
To hell with yöur 26" waist.

570
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:02,999
l can see a six and a
half foot grave there.

571
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,499
Move the steering wheel.

572
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,082
No, steering wheel has failed.

573
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,665
The steering wheel has failed.
yöur mind has failed.

574
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,540
But the brakes didn't fail, right?
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, they didn't.

Are yöu dead or alive?

580

Come closer first.

585
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:50,624
No, l am thinking that it's better..

586
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,582
..if one person
dies rather than two.

587
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:54,957
Coward. Dastard. Pansy. Chicken.

588
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,499
Should l come there to help
yöu so that yöu can help me?

589
00:33:57,791 --> 00:33:59,332
Let me ask help for myself first.

l mean give me yöur leg.

594
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,290
Leg? Man and woman
look good in pair.

595
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:17,165
But to touch something
with ones' leg is a grave sin.

596
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,957
yöu are hanging on the
branch with both yöur hands.

597
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,249
How will yöu save me?

598
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:27,999
Ma'am, each hand of mine has
2 times a gorilla's strength.

599
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,457
Depending on age and size.

600
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,374
By the way, l can
save yöu with one hand.

601
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,499
Then Useless, use that hand.

602

Hold my waist and pull me.

603
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,457
No, no, no. Not the waist.

604
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,415
Then yöu will say
that l took advantage.

605
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,082
What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> By the way yöur waist is..

Hold whatever yöu want.
Do whatever yöu want.

Please save me. Let's go.
What are yöu doing?

615
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,207
Just hanging around.

616
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,082
Don't worry.

617
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,957
yöu women are amazing.

618

Sometimes yöu say

..sometimes yöu say don't take
advantage. What nonsense is this?

621
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,040
All yöur yakking is
making me go crazy.

622
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,665
lt was the demand of the situation.

623
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,624
l wasn't wrong to touch yöu now.

624
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,374
l was wrong to touch yöu earlier.

625
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,124
lf this is not wrong
then why is that wrong?

626
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,040
And if that is wrong
then why isn't this wrong?

627
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,999
Actually, yöu are wrong.

628
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:40,999
lt is wrong to sit
here and talk to yöu.

629
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,249
lt's of no use. l'll lie down.

630
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:46,249
Obviously it's of no use. l'm
sitting and yöu are lying down.

631
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,749
lt would've benefited if either ..

632
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,874
.. both of us were
sitting or lying down.

633
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:52,124
Look, don't say double
meaning things to me.

634
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,457
This is a limit to illiteracy.

635
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,749
Where is a double meaning in it?

636
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,249
Look, don't turn and sleep like
this. l feel something inside.

637
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,999
By the way, the jean fits well..

638
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,249
..on yöur waist.

639
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,207
My ill-fate l wish he wasn't a man.

640
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,874
And yöu weren't a woman.

641
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,790
Sanjana Singh.

642
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,874
Pooja has horns.

643
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,499
Prem!

644
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:34,124
'Prem. Prem. Prem.'

645
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:35,499
lsn't it a great place?

646
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:39,040
yöu call out once and it
echoes back a number of times.

647
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,249
yöu have brought me
here to hear this?

648
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,999
Oh, no. This is nothing.

649
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:46,624
Now l'll shout yöur name and
see what name echoes back.

650
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,207
Should l?

651
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,999
Sanjana!

652
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,832
'Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana.'

653
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,040
Hear it.

654
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,915
'Sanjana. Sanjana. Sanjana.'

655
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,040
l'm saying Pooja and it is
echoing back as Sanjana.

656
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,165
lsn't it a strange place?

657
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,165
Look, the valley is so deep.

658
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,540
Prem.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Only echoes come
back from here, not people.

659
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,582
Tell me the truth. Who are yöu?

660
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,499
Otherwise, l'll let go of yöu.

661
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,874
l'll tell yöu the truth.
Pull be back first.

662
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,915
Come on, start yöur story.

663
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,124
yöu already know my real name.

664
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,082
Sanjana Singh.

665
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,249
Actually, l had come
from America to get married.

666
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,249
But the guy l was
going to get married to..

667
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,790
..turned out to be
a famous don's son.

668
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:39,124
l ran away from the wedding
but they snatched my passport.

669
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,540
lt takes at least 10-12
days to make a new passport.

670
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,957
l needed a place to hide as well.

671
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,790
Then l saw yöu at the airport.

672
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:51,332
yöu had come to pick up
Pooja and no one knew Pooja.

673
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,082
So l thought..

674
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:57,332
yöu know the rest.
<font color="#808080">-</font> l know the rest.

675
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,999
What did yöu do with the real Pooja?

676
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,332
l hope yöu didn't murder her.

677
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:03,999
No. She has gone to attend her
friend's wedding, in Phuket.

678
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,915
She will go to
Guru's ashram from there.

679
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,415
Guru. Guru. Guru.

680
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,915
He is a..

681
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:10,624
Let's go.

682
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,165
Prem.

683
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,749
Hey, move aside.

684
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:25,874
"My heart broke."

685
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:29,082
"My heart went crazy."

686
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,665
l think yöu want me..

687
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,207
..to give yöu a lift.

688
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:41,040
yöu are very handsome and dashing..

689
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,374
..brother.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Brother?

690
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,374
This car won't go anywhere.
lt has broken-down.

691
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,415
Why? What happened, darling?

692
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,540
Darling?
<font color="#808080">-</font> The car will run.

me where yöu should drop me.

695
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,874
l haven't caught yöu
as yet, to drop yöu.

696
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,665
First let me introduce myself.

697
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,790
l'm Mr. Lehri.

698
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,582
l'm sure yöu know Bhappi Lehri.

699
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,874
There is no connection between us.

700
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,707
Yes, there is a connection.

701
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:16,832
He likes gold and l like to sleep.

702
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,665
Hello. Why are yöu whistling?

703
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,582

Who is he? ls he yöur boyfriend?

706

No, he is a distant friend.
<font color="#808080">-</font> A distant friend?

707
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,374
Just like a distant relative.

708
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,999
Okay. Then l have no problem..

709
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:35,332
..because l am shortsighted.

710
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,832
So shall we leave, Mr. Weak?

711
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,082

Come on, darling. Come behind.

Not a problem. We'll talk from here.

00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:01,999
Great. lt's such a yöung

Tell me.

A.K. Hangal in the jungle.

725

yöu know liquor and
beauty have a deep connection?

726
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,457
l'm often intoxicated and
the evening passes away.

727
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:28,749
There will be a day when the
evening will be intoxicated..

728
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,332
..and yöu will pass away.

729

Don't cry, my son. Be strong.

00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,665
..l would like to give
yöu a small warning.

794
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:59,665
Sir, that boy is very smart.

795
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,832
He is fast, in driving cars
and using his brain as well.

796
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,749
lf he will come before yöu
he will do such actions that..

797
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,707
..yöu will forget to give reactions.

798
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:12,332
Has anyone seen that boy?

799
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,207
l've only seen him
from the left side.

800
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,124
And l've only seen him
from the right side.

801
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:19,790
Sir, what is this left and right.
l've seen him from centre.

802
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:21,540
Will yöu be able to recognize him?

803
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,499
yöu are talking about recognizing?

804
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:26,624
Actually, l was
born when l was small.

805
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,124
My mother was a woman.

806
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:30,749
And the person who
murdered my father..

807
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:33,082
..underwent plastic surgery thrice.

808
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:34,624
Yet l recognized him.

809
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,374
Because he used to come to
our shop to buy the plastic.

810
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:40,332
From now onwards, this
plastic will always be with us.

811
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:41,957
Take him away.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No. This is wrong.

812
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:43,207
Shut up.
<font color="#808080">-</font> This is wrong.

813
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,124
Find that boy and Sanjana.

814
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:48,915
Wherever they are hiding find them.

815
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,499
What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> What kind of
childishness is this, Pooja?

816
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,749
ls this a way to behave?

817
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:07,499
Does anyone hold and
push anyone like this?

818
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:10,540
How was that?
<font color="#808080">-</font> What did yöu do?

819
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,457
Like this.. Like this.. What

<font color="#808080">-</font> What did l do?

820
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,415
yöu held her like this
and pushed her like this.

821
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,165
The push she got had that.

822
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,249
The push she got had
minimal effect?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes. Yes.

823
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,415
Okay. Okay. Take yöur position.

<font color="#808080">-</font> Come on. Come on.

Talk to yöur darling nephew.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

826
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,249
From the time they have

827
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,749
..there is a lot of
fun happening around.

828
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:39,582
"lt is fun. lt is fun. lt is fun."

829
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:42,624
Excuse me. Just friends.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Play the wedding tune.

Prem!

832
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:51,874
Prem, yöur method was wrong
but yöur intentions were good.

833
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:55,124
Now l have no complaints
against yöu.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mr. Pathak.

834
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:57,040
No. No. No.

835
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:04,624
My Khushi is so happy with
Raju that l forgot all my sorrows.

Great. Great. Great.
<font color="#808080">-</font> That's great.

838
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:12,249
Raju sent the tickets.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Of economic class?

Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

840
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,124
How do yöu know that?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Because l gave Raju the idea.

841
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:20,040
l told him not to buy first class
tickets as yöu are such a miser..

842
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:21,832
..that yöu will be happy
even with economic class ticket.

843
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:24,874
What happened?
<font color="#808080">-</font> lt got wet.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

844
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:26,040
What is this, Daddy? yöu
always say double meaning things.

845
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,290
There is no double meaning in it.

846
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,624
The thing which we talk.
With which..

847

yöur underwear.
Let's get out of this.

851
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:40,082
Today, l got that and after
a long time that happened.

852
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:41,332
yöu got wet and fell in love?

853
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,040
No, l caught cold.

854
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,040
Today, the Sunday
truly feels like a Sunday.

855
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:50,124
A Sunday will always be a Sunday.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

856
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,624
We never go in the swimming pool
together even if we want to, right?

857
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,749
Really.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Thank yöu,Pooja.

But there is a No Entry here.

860
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,999
Someone stop me.

861
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:05,790
Sir.

862
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,540
A junior priest has
come from Guru's place.

863
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:08,832
He is here?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

My wallet.. From the drawer..

That one. Yes. And the wallet..

868
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:23,207
Priest, why are yöu here? l

869
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,290
l'll tell that later, but
Guru is very angry with yöu.

870
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,874
Why?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Why didn't yöu go to
pick up Pooja from the airport?

871
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:30,207
l had gone there..

872
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:32,040
..but l got a little late.
She left to attend the wedding.

873
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,832
Yes, she will be going to the
ashram directly from the wedding.

874
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:35,290
Be there on time to pick her up.
<font color="#808080">-</font> As yöu say.

875
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:37,082
Where is everyone else?
<font color="#808080">-</font> They are with Pooja..

876
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:40,165
But Pooja is..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Not this one, the
Pooja which was sent last month.

877
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,874
We sent a dog last month..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't call her a dog.

878
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:44,665
The family members
have named her Pooja.

879
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,457
They have named her Pooja? A dog..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Again yöu are calling her a dog.

880
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:48,040
Doggie, dog,
puppy, pup, Raju, Tommy.

881
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,999
Nothing. Call her Pooja.
Otherwise with a broom..

882
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,207
They are so madly in love with
her that nowadays we eat dog food..

883
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,124
Dog.. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

884
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:57,457
Pooja's food.
Pedigree and White Kennel.

885
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,457
So what should l call her? Pooja?

886
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:01,165
Don't call her that if yöu
want to lose yöur loincloth..

887
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,915
..and yöur honour.

888
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,165
Hello, Priest.

889
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,457
They are here to serve yöu.

890
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:06,749
Hello. Hello.

891
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:09,790
Hello. Hello.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hello. Hello.

892
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,040
Bless yöu. Bless yöu.

893
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:14,915
Guru had kept a 'Satyanarayan'
ritual..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Very good.

894
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,540
He has sent the offering of that.

895
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:21,874
Sanjana.. As soon as they call
for Pooja yöu come with the dog.

896
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,749
Tell me, where is Pooja.

897
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:27,165
She is here. Pooja.

898
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,874
Now what do l tell yöu, Priest.

899
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,332
We have got very attached to
Pooja in such a short span.

900
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,082
She is so sweet that as
soon as she came, Prem..

901
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,665
She won everyone's heart.

902
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:47,832
'Oh God, what magic has
this dog done in one month?'

903
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:50,999
Our Pooja is as decent
as she is beautiful.

904
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,665
'A decent dog?'

905
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:54,874
'Have they lost their mind?'

906
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:57,457
She is now our family member.

907
00:49:57,541 --> 00:49:59,374
Does she bite?

908
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,207
What kind of a joke is that?

909
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,749
ls she a suckling
that she will bite?

910
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,457
She is of marriageable age.

911
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:09,665
lt's a different thing if she
starts biting after marriage.

912
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,332
Whether she bites,
scratches or does anything else..

913
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:16,665
..we have decided that she'll be
the daughter-in-law of our family.

914
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:19,040
'They will make a dog
their daughter-in-law?'

915
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,165
'A dog will be
perfect for yöu, son.'

916
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,415
'yöu deserve this.'

917
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,124
What are yöu thinking about?

918
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,499
That is happening
with Guru's permission.

919
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:29,749
'Dandiya', 'Garba'
(Gujarati dance forms).

920
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,665
No, no, no. That.. That.. That..

'They didn't go to pick up

'..and they are
getting him married to her.'

Have lunch before yöu leave.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

Pooja's favourite
dishes have been made today.

931
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:55,249
'Oh, God. They are
feeding dog food to a priest?'

932
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:59,499
Look, l.. yöu can have it.

yöu don't recognize her?

936
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:13,249
yöu are strange. She is our maid.

937
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:16,082
yöu had brought her
here from the ashram.

938
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:21,082
'Look at that. These
lunatics think l am crazy.'

"Love is the dawn of
the slumber of life."

"Love is a very
beautiful punishment."

"lt is as open as our desires."

958
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:50,540
"An untouched feeling touched me."

959
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:56,665
"Like there is
intoxication in the sky."

960
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:58,582

"My prayers have been answered."

"My path tells this to me."

966
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:26,082
"Why don't yöu stray a little?"

967
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:30,915
"Now this journey is unique."

968
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,040
"Please ask my destination.."

969
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:36,749
"..to look out for my
path from the shore."

"lf yöu are with me.."

971
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:41,665
"..this journey is
like a dream to me."

972
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:47,374
"My heart has been
a bit troublesome."

973
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:52,082
"lt has given me some
beautiful problems."

974
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:54,790
"l have fallen in love."

975
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:57,290
"My prayers have been answered."

"Baby, l'll never ever

00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:18,665
"Never even in my
dreams had l ever thought.."

980
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,665
"..that the God of

This is Guru's that.
What is it called.. As..

00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,249
Ashram.

1001
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:37,540
We've come here to fix a wedding
date for yöur marriage with Prem.

1002
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,874
Yes.

1003
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:40,040
Let's go.

1004
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:42,040
yöu go ahead. We'll come.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.

1005
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,665
Pooja, it is
believed that all wishes..

1006
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:49,040
..come true if one
bathes in this sacred pond.

1007
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,332
Come.

1008
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:58,624
Which Pooja are yöu
talking about, Ram?

1009
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,999
Pooja has not returned
from her friend's wedding.

1010
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:06,332
Then who is the one
who has been staying..

1011
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:09,290
..in our house as Pooja
since the past few days.

1012
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:39,040
Who is the scoundrel
yöu ran away with?

1013
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:47,290
Kill his entire family.

1014
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,749
How is that possible!

1015
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:57,832
yöu want me, right?

1016
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,874
l'm ready to come with yöu.

1017
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:03,124
Let's go.

1018
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,999
Come on.

1019
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,624
Leave me.

1020
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,374
Brother-in-law.

1021
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:15,790
Sanjana is not here.

1022
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,124
l knew that yöu would surely come.

1023
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,749
And l, too, knew
that yöu would say..

1024
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:53,999
.."l knew that yöu
would surely come."

1025
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:58,124
Why should l come,
huh? Am l yöur boyfriend?

1026
00:59:58,291 --> 01:00:01,665
l love yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Saw? yöu are agreeing to it.

1027
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,499
No. Really? He's yöur uncle?

1028
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:14,915
Yes.

1029
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:17,290
Prem, how would l tell yöu that..

1030
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,915
..these goons, mafias
are my maternal uncles?

1031
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:21,999
Great.

1032
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:26,290
yöur family members are like
Charles Shobraj and Ranja Billa?

1033
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,874
l love these mafia people.

1034
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,499
Stop joking, Prem.

1035
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:34,249
yöu don't know how much
my uncles hate each other

1036
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:36,874
My mother's last wish was..

1037
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,540
..that l get both my
uncles' blessings at my wedding.

1038
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:41,249
So that their enmity ends forever..

1039
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:43,415
..and they become good human
beings like they were, earlier.

1040
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:47,082
But?
<font color="#808080">-</font> The greed of attaining
my property worth 200 crores..

1041
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:48,540
..increased their enmity.

1042
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:51,499
Each one of them wants me
to marry his brother-in-law.

1043
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,999
200 crores?

1044
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:59,540
l can draw a cheque
without deducting the TDS..

1045
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:01,832
..and keep yöur uncles
in my pocket.

1046
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:06,207
But my dear, until there are
obstacles in a love story..

1047
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,040
..it is not called a love story.

1048
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:11,499
What stories will we
tell our children?

1049
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:14,665
Look, a boyfriend gets
scared of his girlfriend.

1050
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,374
A girlfriend gets
scared of a cockroach.

1051
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:17,957
A cockroach gets scared of a mouse.

1052
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,582
A mouse gets scared of a cat.

1053
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:21,124
A cat gets scared of a dog.

1054
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,957
And a dog gets scared of a man.

1055
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:26,415
<font color="#808080">-</font> And a man is
scared of a woman.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

1056
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,999
Just like a villain..
gets scared of the hero.

1057
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,957
Prem, let's go. My uncle is here.

1058
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:44,290
What now?

1059
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:46,249
They will..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't worry, dear.

1060
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,832
Today, l'll predict yöur future.

1061
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,415
yöu will get married to
an innocent looking rogue.

1062
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,749
That's me.

1063
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,957
Now can l take some advantage?

1064
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:05,040
By the way, the fitting of
the lndian dress is very good.

1065
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:19,790
"Ready.. l am ready for yöu.
Are yöu ready for me?"

1066
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:24,790
"Are yöu ready for me?
Are yöu ready for me?"

1067
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:29,957
"Are yöu ready for me?
l am ready for yöu."

1068
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:46,832
Uncle, Yuvraj was forcefully..

1069
01:02:47,291 --> 01:02:48,582
l ran away from there.

1070
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:50,582
Sit in the car.

1071
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,540
They are drying out.

1072
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:46,656
What should l do about this boy?

1073
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,406
This boy is making me that. That..

1074
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:51,906
lrritate?
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, not irritate.
That.. This.. This..

Emotional?

<font color="#808080">-</font> So?

Crazy.

01:03:57,782 --> 01:03:59,115
He is making crazy. Crazy. Crazy.

1079
01:03:59,741 --> 01:04:02,906
He lied to me. That
girl is not this but that.

1080
01:04:02,991 --> 01:04:04,698
What..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Not Sanjana, Pooja.

1081
01:04:04,782 --> 01:04:05,823
Pooja. Yes. Yes.

1082
01:04:05,949 --> 01:04:08,198
What yöu are thinking
of doing is not so easy.

1083
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:09,656
They are dangerous.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

1084
01:04:09,741 --> 01:04:10,406
They are dons.

1085
01:04:10,616 --> 01:04:12,406
l would've said the same
had l been in yöur place.

1086
01:04:12,574 --> 01:04:15,365
But.. what would've yöu
done had yöu been in my place?

1087
01:04:15,741 --> 01:04:16,948
Why don't yöu make him understand?

1088
01:04:17,532 --> 01:04:18,615
What should l tell him?

1089
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,573
All l know is that
Sanjana is a very nice girl.

1090
01:04:23,241 --> 01:04:24,906
And right now, she
must be in trouble.

1091
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:26,115
She must be in big trouble.

1092
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:27,698
That's true, sister-in-law.

1093
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:29,615
But there is no
solution to this problem.

1094
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:33,823
l have such a solution that l'll make
the lives of both the dons, hell.

1095
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:39,115
They have a common CA,
who has done BA.

1096
01:04:39,324 --> 01:04:40,490
And his name.. What was his name?

1097
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:43,198
Sounds like bully.
<font color="#808080">-</font> ldli (a south lndian snack)?

1098
01:04:43,949 --> 01:04:45,073
Mulli (Raddish)?

Khuli (open)? Khali?

1102
01:04:50,741 --> 01:04:51,656
Khali.

1103
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:53,990
Balli.

01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:55,781
Balidaan Bhardwaj.

1105
01:04:55,907 --> 01:05:00,073
Sakku, how many
times will yöu call me?

1106
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:02,615
l feel that yöu call me even
when yöu dial a wrong number.

1107
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:03,531
What do l do?

1108
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:06,156
yöu have left the
house with so much cash.

1109
01:05:06,616 --> 01:05:08,406
l'm feeling scared.

1110
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:11,031
This isn't the first time
l'm out with so much cash.

1111
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,948
l do transactions worth millions,
day and night.

01:05:14,032 --> 01:05:16,323
All 500 and 1000
denomination bills..

01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:18,365
..across the world
knows Balidaan Bhardwaj.

1114
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:19,656
Then?
<font color="#808080">-</font> That's fine.

1115

But what if a thief

01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:27,073
Sakku, are yöu concerned about me..

One of 30 lakhs and

01:05:36,824 --> 01:05:38,073
Take this.

1122

My bag?

1123
01:05:54,991 --> 01:05:56,906
My bag! Where did my bag go?

Where is my bag? There

My bag. My bag got stolen.

01:06:06,782 --> 01:06:09,031
l didn't see it. l'm
not the owner of it.

1131

yöu.. Have yöu seen yöur face?

1132
01:06:11,407 --> 01:06:12,448
lt's so black that if

1133
01:06:12,532 --> 01:06:14,240
..it will ward off evil
from the entire country.

1134
01:06:16,574 --> 01:06:19,490
Sakku, what yöu
said came true. Sakku.

1135
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:20,365
What happened?

1136

Amar Chaudhary and Suraj
Chaudhary's 50 lakhs got stolen.

1137

1138
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:27,323
Don't do this. Pack the bags.

Come on.

Mr. Bhardwaj. Mr. Bhardwaj.

1143
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:39,906
He has not only left this
house but this world as well.

1144
01:06:40,741 --> 01:06:43,448
A trunk ran over him.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Oh, no.

1145
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:44,823
He got crushed.

1146

Do yöu have anyone to look
after yöu in this cruel world?

1147
01:06:48,782 --> 01:06:49,823
No.

1148
01:06:50,449 --> 01:06:52,448
By the way, l had
brought this bag for him.

1149
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:56,531
What will l do of this
briefcase when he is no more?

1150
01:06:56,657 --> 01:07:01,323
Don't worry. l'll take
care of both his belongings.

1151
01:07:01,407 --> 01:07:03,573
Okay? Let's meet

<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, l'm alive.

01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:15,490
Start wearing a
wedding chain from tomorrow.

1158
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:17,573
People get mistaken.

1159
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:18,615
She is mine.

1160

How did yöu come to know
that there are 50 lakhs in it?

1165
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:32,823
Just be looking at the

..l can predict how
many notes it contains.

1167

How?
<font color="#808080">-</font> l learnt this art
from my master. Mr. B. B., sir.

No way, sir. The one who

1173
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:50,823
Mr. Balidaan Bhardwaj.

1174
01:07:51,074 --> 01:07:52,323
Be careful, sir.

1175
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:53,448

1176
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:55,490
When did l write this book?

1177
01:07:55,574 --> 01:07:56,490
Such a fat book?

yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

01:08:00,366 --> 01:08:01,240
That's me.

1181
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:02,948
This is a sign of a genius.

1182
01:08:03,032 --> 01:08:05,698
yöu wrote a book and
yöu don't even remember.

1183
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,656
Sir, this book is a
missile and yöu are an example..

1184
01:08:07,741 --> 01:08:10,156
..for a newcomer like me.

1185
01:08:10,491 --> 01:08:12,323

Amar Chaudhary and Suraj Chaudhary.

1191
01:08:26,782 --> 01:08:28,656
Sir, they are mafias.

1192
01:08:28,741 --> 01:08:29,406
One is a mongoose.

1193
01:08:29,491 --> 01:08:30,406
And the other one is a snake.

1194
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:32,156
lf they get together
then they are killer sharks.

1195
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:34,031
But both of them are illiterates.

1196
01:08:35,366 --> 01:08:37,740
How many times during
a year do yöu think..

1197
01:08:37,824 --> 01:08:40,198
..people like Chaudhary
must be paying their taxes?

1198
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:45,323
Sir, they must not even be
paying the taxi fare. Sir..

1199
01:08:45,407 --> 01:08:47,990
l make them pay tax every month.

1200
01:08:48,074 --> 01:08:49,073
Every month?

1201
01:08:49,949 --> 01:08:51,448
Again and again.

What do l do? lt is
dirty but it is my business.

1205
01:08:56,074 --> 01:08:57,323
lt is yöur business.

1206

This is the only way to

1207
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:05,115
Sir, yöur name is Balidaan but yöu

01:09:42,657 --> 01:09:44,490
The president got changed.

1221
01:09:44,574 --> 01:09:46,156
lt is my fault that the
president got changed?

1222
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:49,531
What do l have to do with when
and where Alexander fought Porus?

1223
01:09:49,616 --> 01:09:52,073
Do l have to go there
and dig their graves?

1224
01:09:52,657 --> 01:09:53,823
Hit him. Hit him. Hit him.

1225

01:11:54,032 --> 01:11:57,448
What did yöu say?
<font color="#808080">-</font> No. l saw
my horoscope in the morning.

1275
01:11:57,532 --> 01:11:59,573
Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> ln it it's
written that if l salute..

1276
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,073
..anyone yöunger than me today..

1277
01:12:01,366 --> 01:12:02,698
..then he will get
thrashed all day long.

1278
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:04,698
But still if yöu want..
<font color="#808080">-</font> No, no. Let it be.

1279
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:07,365
But l have read his horoscope.

1280
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:11,406
Balli. Come on.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Let it be,
today. My nephew is with me. So..

1281
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:12,406
Balli.

1282
01:12:13,616 --> 01:12:14,531
Yes.

1283
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:21,823
Now my hands feel warmer.

1284
01:12:21,949 --> 01:12:23,573
The apple of my eye.

1285
01:12:23,616 --> 01:12:26,656
My brave boy.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Wild hippo, Amar Chaudhary.

1286
01:12:28,032 --> 01:12:30,698
Write 'Welcome' on yöur face.

1287
01:12:31,407 --> 01:12:34,240
yöu will look like
a rotten doormat.

1288
01:12:34,907 --> 01:12:40,490
Anyway, yöur ponytail
looks like a dead dog's tail.

1289
01:12:40,574 --> 01:12:42,948
Look at yöur grandpa.
lt suits him so well.

1290
01:12:43,407 --> 01:12:45,615
Take this. Stupid. Go to school.

1291
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:49,490
Yes, grandpa. This is the first time
mother has said the right thing.

1292
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,573
The girls in my class tease me.

1293
01:12:51,616 --> 01:12:53,948
They said it looks like theirs.

1294
01:12:54,032 --> 01:12:56,531
With yöur permission
can l chop it off?

1295
01:12:56,616 --> 01:13:01,198
Amar Chaudhary, yöu can have yöur
neck cut but not yöur ponytail.

1296
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:03,365
This is a warning, not advice.

1297
01:13:03,616 --> 01:13:07,906
We are samurais. This is
the identity of our family.

1298
01:13:07,991 --> 01:13:09,448
yöur l.D. proof.

1299
01:13:09,616 --> 01:13:13,198
lt is a voter's card,
pan card. yöur blood group.

1300
01:13:13,282 --> 01:13:14,906
A proof that yöu are his
grandson and he is yöur grandpa.

1301
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:20,406
Where did this
boring old man come from?

1302
01:13:21,157 --> 01:13:22,031
Great grandpa.

1303
01:13:22,116 --> 01:13:23,615
l saw yöu.

1304
01:13:23,741 --> 01:13:25,198
Today my day will go well.

1305
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:26,823
Concentrate on yöur studies.

1306
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:29,823
Kids of yöur age have gone places.

1307
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:33,948
People of yöur age as well..

1308
01:13:34,741 --> 01:13:36,323
..have gone places.

1309
01:13:36,407 --> 01:13:38,615
"Happy days are over."

1310
01:13:38,907 --> 01:13:41,323
"Now l'm surrounded with sadness."

1311
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:44,073
What is this, Mr. Lehri?

1312
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:45,823
What are yöu doing?

1313
01:13:46,157 --> 01:13:49,781
l'm having black coffee
with Obama in the White House.

1314
01:13:50,157 --> 01:13:51,198
Can't yöu see?

1315
01:13:51,616 --> 01:13:54,740
l hit the brakes to give yöu a lift.

1316
01:13:54,824 --> 01:13:57,406
Now my shirt has turned into a mop.

1317
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:00,531
All this happened
because of me, right?

1318
01:14:01,616 --> 01:14:02,948
l'm feeling very guilty.

1319
01:14:03,532 --> 01:14:04,448
l love yöu too.

1320
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:09,406
Now it is my duty to
get yöu out of here.

1321
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:10,823
l also want to leave.

1322
01:14:11,074 --> 01:14:13,531
Because if my children grow
up they won't recognize me.

1323
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,490
And my wife is so nave
that the poor thing..

1324
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:17,406
..might once again
run away with someone.

1325
01:14:17,824 --> 01:14:20,906
No such thing will happen
because l have a mind-blowing idea.

1326
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:27,115
This is the boy with
whom Sanjana ran away, sir.

1327
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,656
He doesn't look like
he is from our city.

1328
01:14:31,741 --> 01:14:35,240
l'll find him even if he
is hiding underground.

1329
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:37,990
Are yöu telling the truth?

1330
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:40,990
Sir, if l am lying he
should die immediately.

1331
01:14:41,074 --> 01:14:42,740
No, l take his oath
and say that henceforth..

1332
01:14:42,824 --> 01:14:46,448
..that that boy was
not him but someone else.

1333
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:51,031
Sir.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What happened?

1334
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:54,281
Sir, someone has come to meet yöu.

1335
01:14:56,657 --> 01:15:02,156
Balli, yöu got the land cleared
for Amar for his liquor factory?

1336
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:05,281
l just got the land
cleared for him.

1337
01:15:05,366 --> 01:15:08,240
But for yöu along with
the land l also got..

1338
01:15:08,324 --> 01:15:11,073
..the license for the
liquor factory cleared.

1339
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:15,615
Lehri, go. yöu are free to go.

1340
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:21,115
Mr. Chaudhary, l am
leaving but before leaving..

1341
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,948
..l would like to
give yöu a warning.

1342
01:15:23,032 --> 01:15:26,406
Sir, this boy is very smart.

1343
01:15:26,491 --> 01:15:29,448
Only l know how he traps people.

1344
01:15:29,532 --> 01:15:31,990
yöu won't be able
to anything to him..

1345
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:33,531
..even if he comes
and stands before yöu.

1346
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:34,990
yöu do one thing.

1347
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:39,323
yöu keep cleaning cars
here till Sanjana's marriage.

1348
01:15:39,407 --> 01:15:40,656
Sir, what are yöu saying?

1349
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:42,656
Sir, this is a crime. lt's a sin.

1350
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:44,281
Mr. Chaudhary, yöu cannot do this.

1351
01:15:44,449 --> 01:15:46,031
Mr. Chaudhary can do anything.

1352
01:15:46,616 --> 01:15:48,323
He is Justice Chaudhary.

1353
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,281
He provides justice to good people.

1354
01:15:50,366 --> 01:15:51,615
And he clears out the bad people.

1355
01:15:51,699 --> 01:15:53,615
Pick him and throw him out.

1356
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:56,156
Balli, who is this boy?

1357
01:15:56,241 --> 01:15:58,490
He is a con. C- O- N. Con.

1358
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:03,781
He joined hands with
that girl and fooled me.

1359
01:16:04,032 --> 01:16:08,698
Which animal have l left out?
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu dog, clean the car.

1360
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,781
Mr. Chaudhary,
isn't the boy useful?

1361
01:16:13,491 --> 01:16:17,281
Once l start working, there
will be no income and no tax.

1362
01:16:17,616 --> 01:16:18,656
No income tax.

1363
01:16:20,616 --> 01:16:22,990
But Balli, how is this possible?

1364
01:16:23,241 --> 01:16:25,906
This boy will work
for Amar as well as us.

1365
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:27,073
He has a habit..

1366
01:16:27,574 --> 01:16:28,990
..of doing two things together.

1367
01:16:29,074 --> 01:16:30,531
yöu know K.K. Modi in America?

1368
01:16:30,616 --> 01:16:34,198
He used to also handle his
yöunger brother B.K. Modi's account.

1369
01:16:34,282 --> 01:16:36,990
But what if he turns out to be bad?

1370
01:16:37,074 --> 01:16:39,365
Then yöu can behead my uncle.

1371
01:16:39,657 --> 01:16:42,073
Behead me?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Saw? He agrees to it.

1372
01:16:42,157 --> 01:16:43,531
The thumb impression
on the file. Take it.

1373
01:16:44,741 --> 01:16:45,573
Just a minute.

1374
01:16:46,741 --> 01:16:49,823
Uncle, l was casually
checking yöur accounts.

1375
01:16:50,324 --> 01:16:51,615
There are a lot of discrepancies.

1376
01:16:51,699 --> 01:16:53,448
What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> There must be a slight difference.

1377
01:16:53,532 --> 01:16:55,323
21.
<font color="#808080">-</font> 21.. Balli.

1378
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:56,573
There is a difference of Rs.21.

1379
01:16:57,366 --> 01:16:59,698
Rs.21, dear? lt's
hardly a difference.

1380
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:00,990
Just a minute, uncle.

1381
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:03,573
yöu are his assistant, right?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, ma'am.

1382
01:17:03,616 --> 01:17:04,906
Come on, show me the accounts.

1383
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:07,115
Uncle, l'll go and check
the accounts properly.

1384
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,073
Yes, yes. Okay, dear.

1385
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:08,698
Hey..

1386
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:11,698
Persuade her.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Consider it done.

1387
01:17:13,907 --> 01:17:18,740
Balli, yöu saw how my
niece's education is benefiting me?

1388
01:17:18,824 --> 01:17:21,323
Prem, this is not the right
situation to take advantage.

1389
01:17:21,407 --> 01:17:23,323
Really? Then promise me
that yöu will meet me tonight.

1390
01:17:23,407 --> 01:17:26,156
And yöu will let me take
all the advantages.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Prem.

1391
01:17:27,574 --> 01:17:28,740
yöu..

1392
01:17:37,074 --> 01:17:39,740
yöu okay?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes. l was just joking.

1393
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:46,698
Balli, why do yöu look
as if yöu've seen a ghost?

1394
01:17:46,782 --> 01:17:49,698
Our future daughter-in-law
is checking everything, right?

1395
01:17:49,782 --> 01:17:51,615
Yes. ln detail. Come
with me. Come with me.

1396
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:52,823
Let them work.

1397
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:56,448
Saw that? My future
wife is no ordinary girl.

1398
01:17:56,532 --> 01:17:58,031
Yes, l just came to know.

1399
01:17:58,116 --> 01:17:59,656
She has taken after
me deceased sister.

1400
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,615
So, yöur sister was also like her?

1401
01:18:01,657 --> 01:18:02,615
Then the entire family..

1402
01:18:04,907 --> 01:18:05,531
What happened?

1403
01:18:05,616 --> 01:18:09,198
He is getting scared.
<font color="#808080">-</font> He fears he might get caught.

1404
01:18:09,616 --> 01:18:10,656
Sanjana..

1405
01:18:12,616 --> 01:18:14,240
Sanjana is not my daughter.

1406
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:16,365
She is more than a
daughter to me, Prem.

1407
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:19,115
Her happiness
means everything to me.

1408
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:23,031
But.. But yöu don't know her uncles.

1409

They..
<font color="#808080">-</font> l know.

Orthodox.

1412
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:34,656
l am a modern age dog. Latest.

1413
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:39,948
When we will fight,
l will eat them up.

1414
01:18:42,116 --> 01:18:45,615
"l am a dog and she is my partner."

1415
01:18:45,907 --> 01:18:48,781
"l tell the truth, when she came.."

1416
01:18:48,907 --> 01:18:52,406
"..there came a season
to eat everyone up."

1417
01:18:52,907 --> 01:18:54,115
Stop it.

1418
01:18:56,741 --> 01:18:59,156
Look, aunt, everything will be fine.

1419
01:18:59,616 --> 01:19:00,573
l promise.

1420
01:19:02,116 --> 01:19:03,990
What were yöu doing inside?
All that cuddling and all?

1421
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:05,490
Uncle, she fell over me.

1422
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,365
Girls from
affluent families.. Hello.

1423
01:19:07,907 --> 01:19:10,240
Girls from affluent families
are like that. Try to understand.

1424
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:11,906
Whether she falls on
yöu or yöu wall on her..

1425
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:14,198
..our necks will get
cut and fall down.

1426
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,823
Uncle, yöu only
asked me to persuade her.

1427

opened the accounts.

"When the winter
season starts in January."

1439
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:51,615
"We will switch on
the heater of love."

1440

"ln a blanket as
small as February.."

1441

"..we will play hide and seek."

1442

"March will be a romantic month."

1443
01:21:00,616 --> 01:21:03,448
"We'll do something we
have never done before."

1444
01:21:03,532 --> 01:21:06,323
"What if we aren't
able to meet in April?"

1445
01:21:06,407 --> 01:21:09,115
"What will happen? Find a solution."

1446
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:14,740
"l'll get an internet connection
so that l can chat with yöu."

1447
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:46,615
"When the summer
season starts in May.."

1448
01:21:46,824 --> 01:21:49,448
"..we will party at the poolside."

1449
01:21:49,532 --> 01:21:52,365
"We will take a long
vacation in June."

1450
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:55,281
"We will go to a hill station."

1451
01:21:55,532 --> 01:21:58,406
"When starts raining in July.."

1452
01:21:58,491 --> 01:22:01,281
"..l'll yearn to embrace yöu."

1453
01:22:01,366 --> 01:22:04,198
"We will have a lot
of fun in August."

1454
01:22:04,282 --> 01:22:06,906
"We will make some arrangements."

1455
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:09,823
"l'll take yöu to London.
l'll give yöu a tour of Paris."

1456
01:22:09,949 --> 01:22:12,615
"l'll take yöu on a world tour."

"l feel that l'll be coming
often to yöur house in September."

1458
01:22:53,157 --> 01:22:55,990
"We'll see the sunsets
together in October."

1459
01:22:56,074 --> 01:22:58,906
"yöu can keep yöur
head on my shoulders."

1460
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:01,990
"By the time the
wretch November comes.."

1461
01:23:02,074 --> 01:23:04,823
"..yöu would've already
surrendered yöur heart."

1462
01:23:04,949 --> 01:23:07,698
"Things will get
confirmed on 12th December."

1463
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:10,573
"With the
confirmation from our hearts."

1464
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:13,323
"There will be no car or mare."

1465

"Now l think l won't
be able to survive.."

1468
01:23:43,282 --> 01:23:45,406
"..even for 12 minutes without yöu."

1469
01:24:16,032 --> 01:24:17,448
Prem hasn't come as yet, dear.

1470
01:24:18,074 --> 01:24:19,698
Don't worry, aunt.
He will surely come.

1471
01:24:19,782 --> 01:24:21,198
Why don't yöu go and
pay yöur respects..

1472
01:24:21,282 --> 01:24:22,240
..as yöu have come to the temple,
Junior Chaudhary?

1473
01:24:24,116 --> 01:24:25,365
Tell me.

1474
01:24:25,449 --> 01:24:28,031

1475
01:24:28,116 --> 01:24:29,698
He failed me.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Then why have yöu come here?

1476
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,823
l'm my grandpa's junior spy.

1477
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:34,698
Whenever any female in the
family goes out of the house..

1478
01:24:34,782 --> 01:24:36,240
..l keep an eye on them.

1479
01:24:37,074 --> 01:24:39,323
Whether they are going
and meeting our enemies.

1480
01:24:40,532 --> 01:24:41,323
Aunt.

1481
01:24:45,116 --> 01:24:46,115
Go.

1482
01:24:48,032 --> 01:24:49,198

Sister.

1486
01:24:57,449 --> 01:24:58,656
Someone stop them.

1487
01:24:58,741 --> 01:24:59,573
yöu are crying?

1488
01:24:59,616 --> 01:25:00,781
They are bound to cry.

1489
01:25:01,782 --> 01:25:05,365
These sisters-in-law love each
other more than their own sister.

1490
01:25:05,449 --> 01:25:09,781
ln spite of living in the same
city we have met after ages.

1491
01:25:10,324 --> 01:25:13,906
Our men our fighting and
we women are suffering.

1492
01:25:14,657 --> 01:25:16,823
l wonder when this will end.

1493
01:25:17,074 --> 01:25:19,531
Like l have united the aunts l
will unite the uncles as well.

1494
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:22,281
lf l don't turn this family into
a 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon' family..

1495
01:25:22,366 --> 01:25:23,531
..then don't call me Prem.

1496
01:25:24,532 --> 01:25:25,448
Thank yöu.

1497
01:25:31,824 --> 01:25:33,990
Okay, so yöu are
befriending our enemies..

1498
01:25:34,074 --> 01:25:35,615
..in the pretext of
praying and worshiping?

1499
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:38,448
Son, she isn't an enemy.
She is yöur grandaunt.

1500
01:25:38,532 --> 01:25:40,948
Amar, my child.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't touch me, yöu old woman.

1501

..l'll feed yöu kerosene and light
a match in front of yöur mouth.

Forgive him, sister.

1505
01:25:52,282 --> 01:25:54,615
His grandfather has
made him just like him.

1506
01:25:54,866 --> 01:25:56,031
l wonder when he will
mend his ways.

1507
01:25:56,282 --> 01:25:57,406
Why are yöu laughing?

1508
01:25:58,324 --> 01:26:01,740
He will change, but l'm laughing..

1509
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:03,323
..thinking of the way
in which he will change.

1510
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:06,781
Junior Chaudhary,
the park is closed.

1511
01:26:06,907 --> 01:26:09,531
lt's closed for others, not me.

1512
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:12,615
Go and tell the manager,
Amar Chaudhary is here.

1513
01:26:12,657 --> 01:26:13,948
The park will remain open.

Salute me.

1517
01:26:23,366 --> 01:26:25,990
The park should be closed now.
We have to go home.

1518

yöu are refusing Amar Chaudhary?

1519

01:29:07,032 --> 01:29:09,948
Shut up.

1542
01:29:14,907 --> 01:29:15,990
The kid has tired me.

1543

First try to talk things out.

1544

lf they don't

1545

Amar Chaudhary.

Why do yöu have

Okay. Okay. Fashion.

Respecting my elders, grandfather.

01:30:30,074 --> 01:30:31,031
Someone is coming.

1568
01:30:33,741 --> 01:30:35,198
Come on, get the cars out.

1569
01:30:35,282 --> 01:30:36,490
Load yöur guns.

1570
01:30:36,574 --> 01:30:38,073
Let there be bloodshed?

1571
01:30:38,157 --> 01:30:40,656
We will have to bring Sanjana
at any cost by this evening.

1572
01:30:40,741 --> 01:30:42,323
What are yöu doing, Chaudhary..

1573
01:30:43,491 --> 01:30:44,656
Sir. Uncle, tell them.

1574
01:30:44,949 --> 01:30:45,990
What yöu are doing is wrong.

1575
01:30:46,949 --> 01:30:49,323
yöu are going to kill
yöur brother for 200 crores?

1576
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:52,323
Whereas someone worth 500
crores is in uncle's pocket.

1577
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:55,198
Who are yöu talking about?

1578
01:30:55,282 --> 01:30:57,031
Uncle, l'm talking about K.K Modi.

1579
01:30:57,491 --> 01:31:00,031
Yes. K.K. Modi from America.

1580
01:31:00,116 --> 01:31:01,698
Tell them how much he is worth.

1581
01:31:01,991 --> 01:31:04,240
He is worth 5000-7000 crores.

1582
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:08,323
And hear this. yöu
know who has been given..

1583
01:31:08,407 --> 01:31:11,615
..the responsibility of
getting his daughter Naina married?

1584
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,198
Uncle.

1585
01:31:15,782 --> 01:31:18,906
Uncle, yöu couldn't
see this gem of a person?

1586
01:31:18,991 --> 01:31:21,781
Whereas Naina
desires a gem of a person.

1587
01:31:23,032 --> 01:31:24,615
They are such lovely people.

1588
01:31:24,699 --> 01:31:27,531
They are romantic. They are
going to kill their brothers.

1589
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,948
Uncle, if l wouldn't
have thought of this..

1590
01:31:29,032 --> 01:31:30,781
..then there would've
been a bloodshed today.

1591
01:31:30,907 --> 01:31:32,240
Why don't yöu think?

1592
01:31:32,324 --> 01:31:34,573
No, the idea was on
the way in my mind..

1593
01:31:34,616 --> 01:31:35,740
..but because of traffic..

1594
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:38,073
Get this straight, Balli.

1595
01:31:38,157 --> 01:31:42,740
lf we don't get this alliance
then consider yöurself death.

1596
01:31:45,824 --> 01:31:47,365
Get out of here.

1597
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:50,406

name just like that.

1598
01:31:50,491 --> 01:31:52,198
yöu added his daughter
to the story.

1599
01:31:52,282 --> 01:31:53,698
yöu added the
responsibility of her marriage.

1600
01:31:53,782 --> 01:31:55,365
yöu added all the spices.

1601
01:31:55,449 --> 01:31:59,823
Sir, yöu told me all this..
after having a few drinks.

1602
01:31:59,907 --> 01:32:02,656

people who don't exist?

1603
01:32:02,741 --> 01:32:03,281
They exist, sir.

1604
01:32:03,366 --> 01:32:04,406
Listen.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes?

1605
01:32:04,491 --> 01:32:07,406
Some K.K. Modi has called
five times since morning.

1606
01:32:07,491 --> 01:32:09,281
He told me to remind
yöu that he is coming..

1607
01:32:09,366 --> 01:32:12,448
..to lndia on Friday to
discuss his daughter's wedding.

1608
01:32:12,616 --> 01:32:15,115
And yes, he has asked
to book some resort.

1609
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,490
Don't forget.

1610
01:32:19,699 --> 01:32:20,948
How is this possible?

1611
01:32:22,241 --> 01:32:26,198
Sir, this means yöu
either have MP or UP.

1612
01:32:26,282 --> 01:32:27,365
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh?

1613
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:29,615
MP means memory power.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.

1614
01:32:29,782 --> 01:32:32,615
Sir, in this illness the
battery of memory conks off.

1615
01:32:33,074 --> 01:32:35,823
Or UP that is unbelievable power.

1616
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:37,365
Unbelievable power.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, sir.

1617
01:32:37,449 --> 01:32:40,906
ln this the characters yöu
think about come in real life.

1618
01:32:41,407 --> 01:32:42,281
l don't believe this.

1619
01:32:42,366 --> 01:32:44,281
That's why it is
called unbelievable power.

1620
01:32:44,366 --> 01:32:46,490
Now yöu have to decide whether..

1621
01:32:46,574 --> 01:32:48,073
..it's yöur effective
thinking or defective disease.

1622
01:32:48,324 --> 01:32:51,240
Meanwhile, sir, yöu have
thrown me out of the house.

1623
01:32:52,074 --> 01:32:52,990
Bye.

1624
01:32:53,074 --> 01:32:54,531

<font color="#808080">-</font> No, Prem.

1625

1626
01:32:57,532 --> 01:32:59,406
Okay.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't leave me in such confusion.

1627
01:32:59,491 --> 01:32:59,948
Okay, sir.

1628
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,156
Tell me what l should do next.

1629
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:03,406
There is no option
or resort to this.

1630
01:33:03,782 --> 01:33:07,115
Yes, the last resort is
that yöu book a resort.

1631
01:33:07,324 --> 01:33:07,990
Okay.

1632
01:33:17,407 --> 01:33:18,115
They have come?

1633
01:33:19,407 --> 01:33:20,115
Limo.

1634
01:33:34,532 --> 01:33:36,281

Uncle, go and welcome Modi.

1636
01:33:38,741 --> 01:33:40,073
What a pleasant surprise.

Come here. Come here.
Give yöur friend a hug.

1638
01:33:43,741 --> 01:33:45,031
yöu have become fit.

1639
01:33:45,116 --> 01:33:47,365
l think it is the result of
sister-in-law Shakuntala's that.

1640
01:33:47,449 --> 01:33:48,948
Love.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Her love.

1641
01:33:49,157 --> 01:33:50,490
How is sister-in-law Sakku?

1642
01:33:50,699 --> 01:33:53,406
l hope yöu didn't have any
that on the way. What is it..

1643
01:33:53,491 --> 01:33:56,656
No, no. One has to take some
that for one's child. Some..

1644
01:33:56,741 --> 01:33:57,698
Trouble.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, trouble.

1648
01:34:02,824 --> 01:34:04,281
Mr. Modi, he is Mr. Chaudhary.

Aunt Modi.

1654
01:34:10,491 --> 01:34:11,823
Balli works for us.

Let's go.

1660
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,198
Why are yöu staring at
them with yöur mouth open?

1661
01:34:24,532 --> 01:34:25,740
Have yöu seen them
for the first time?

1662
01:34:25,824 --> 01:34:28,406
Anyone will give that
reaction on seeing Mr. Modi.

1663
01:34:28,491 --> 01:34:30,573
Sir, if yöu are a
mouse then he is a cat.

1664
01:34:30,616 --> 01:34:31,615
lf yöu are a cat, he is a dog.

1665
01:34:31,699 --> 01:34:32,823
lf yöu are a dog, he is a fox.

1666
01:34:32,949 --> 01:34:34,031
lf yöu are a fox then he is a lion.

1667
01:34:34,116 --> 01:34:35,323
lf yöu are lion then
he is an elephant.

1668
01:34:35,407 --> 01:34:36,656
lf yöu are an elephant
then he is a dinosaur.

1669
01:34:36,741 --> 01:34:38,448
Dinosaur of business, sir.

1670
01:34:38,782 --> 01:34:41,281
For yöur own good,
come on time for dinner.

1671
01:34:41,366 --> 01:34:42,781
Otherwise yöu are a donkey, sir.

1672
01:34:42,949 --> 01:34:43,990
Who is going anywhere?

1673
01:34:44,074 --> 01:34:45,240

<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

Let's go.

1676

What happened, uncle?

1677
01:34:48,741 --> 01:34:50,531
He met me with so much affection.

1678
01:34:50,616 --> 01:34:51,740
He gave me a hug as well.

1679
01:34:51,824 --> 01:34:53,531
But l couldn't recognize him.

1680
01:34:54,241 --> 01:34:56,365
ls it an illness or my imagination?

1681
01:34:56,449 --> 01:34:57,448
Both.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Both?

1682
01:34:57,824 --> 01:34:58,781
One personality is ill.

1683
01:34:58,907 --> 01:35:00,073
lt is the imagination of
the other personality.

1684
01:35:00,657 --> 01:35:01,948
The first and the
second personality clashed..

1685
01:35:02,032 --> 01:35:03,156
..with each other and
resulted in the third personality.

1686
01:35:03,241 --> 01:35:04,073
Spilt personality.

1687
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,531
The fourth personality
will be suicidal personality.

1688
01:35:06,616 --> 01:35:09,198
yöu will feel like
committing suicide, uncle.

1689
01:35:09,366 --> 01:35:10,740
yöu are right.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No.

<font color="#808080">-</font> Why?

1692
01:35:14,741 --> 01:35:16,573
yöu won't remember that yöu
have committed suicide, uncle.

1693
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:18,615
So what should l do?

1694
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:20,240
Uncle, now yöu have
only one option left.

1695
01:35:20,324 --> 01:35:23,490
What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Believe that yöur personality
with imagination is right.

<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu recognize him.

1698
01:35:28,407 --> 01:35:30,365

Otherwise, l'll commit suicide..

1699
01:35:30,449 --> 01:35:31,906
..and l won't even
remember it. So what's the use?

1700
01:35:32,324 --> 01:35:33,156
He is K.K. Modi.

1701
01:35:33,449 --> 01:35:36,031
Mr. Modi, we are not
as rich as yöu are.

1702
01:35:36,532 --> 01:35:38,448
But we are well
respected in the city.

1703

Great.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, sir. They are decent people.

cars and are cultured as well.

1706
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:47,948
No, sister-in-law, l am..

Balli, tell them.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What should l say?

1708
01:35:51,949 --> 01:35:54,323
Uncle, with yöur permission
can l tell them?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, please.

1709
01:35:55,616 --> 01:35:58,490
Mr. Modi, he is his brother-in-law.

1710
01:35:58,574 --> 01:35:59,490
Yuvraj.

1711
01:36:00,116 --> 01:36:01,573
He has studied till the
8th grade. The 8th grade.

1712
01:36:01,616 --> 01:36:02,906
Raise two more fingers.

1713
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:04,740
Yes, the 8th grade.

1714
01:36:04,991 --> 01:36:05,823
He has studied till
the 8th grade. So?

1715
01:36:05,949 --> 01:36:07,656
He wants to marry yöur daughter.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

1716
01:36:08,907 --> 01:36:10,990
Brother Ballu, yöu have
brought such an alliance?

1717
01:36:11,532 --> 01:36:12,615
Have yöu seen their faces?

1718
01:36:12,741 --> 01:36:14,781
They look as if they have
just come out of a jungle.

1719
01:36:15,116 --> 01:36:18,031
Right. Will their daughter
marry into this illiterate family?

1720
01:36:18,116 --> 01:36:19,031
The Modis.

1721
01:36:19,616 --> 01:36:21,948
They don't have any
sense of that. Fashion.

1722
01:36:22,032 --> 01:36:23,615
Nor do they know how to that.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Talk.

01:36:23,657 --> 01:36:25,573
To talk. They look like that. That..

1730

1732
01:36:40,449 --> 01:36:42,073
l'll blow yöur head
with yöu, yöu scoundrel.

1733
01:36:42,157 --> 01:36:44,490
yöu fool, he isn't a scoundrel,
yöu are.

1734
01:36:44,574 --> 01:36:45,990
Do yöu know who
are yöu messing with?

1735
01:36:46,074 --> 01:36:48,156
yöu can only make
scrabbled-eggs from an egg.

1736
01:36:48,324 --> 01:36:51,156
Mr. Modi can turn
scrabbled-eggs back to an egg.

1737
01:36:51,241 --> 01:36:52,948
yöu have spoilt the whole game.

1738
01:36:53,157 --> 01:36:55,990
But it's okay. Uncle is here.
He will think of something.

1739
01:36:56,074 --> 01:36:57,115
What will l think of?

1740
01:36:58,282 --> 01:36:59,615
l am totally confused.

1741
01:37:01,116 --> 01:37:02,948
Will yöu tell us
what this is all about?

1742
01:37:03,032 --> 01:37:04,781
Why have yöu made us
all wear sunglasses?

1743
01:37:04,907 --> 01:37:06,740
Excuse me for my language, grandpa.

1744
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:10,490
But what do these
Modis think of themselves?

1745
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:12,740
They have kept three
conditions for the wedding.

1746
01:37:12,824 --> 01:37:15,323
l told them that l won't be
able to look into yöur eyes..

1747
01:37:15,407 --> 01:37:16,906
..after telling
yöu those conditions.

1748
01:37:16,991 --> 01:37:19,740
And yöu won't be able to look at
each other after hearing them.

1749
01:37:19,824 --> 01:37:21,115
He said, "Here, make them
wear these sunglasses.."

1750
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:22,073
"..and tell them the conditions."

1751
01:37:22,324 --> 01:37:24,115
Tell us. Tell us, what
their conditions are.

1752
01:37:24,199 --> 01:37:25,906
Basically the Modis have made..

1753
01:37:25,991 --> 01:37:29,115
..the tent of Chaudhary's
lives stand on three sticks.

1754
01:37:29,491 --> 01:37:30,490
Condition No. 1.

1755
01:37:30,574 --> 01:37:34,906
They don't like the way yöu dress.

1756
01:37:34,991 --> 01:37:35,615
What are yöu doing?

1757
01:37:35,824 --> 01:37:39,615
They say that yöu look like
a C-Grade movie's villain.

1758
01:37:39,699 --> 01:37:40,823
How dare they!

1759
01:37:40,949 --> 01:37:42,281
This.. This is what uncle said.

1760

How dare they!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes. Yes.

1761
01:37:44,449 --> 01:37:46,115
The Chaudharys will never change..

..their dressing sense for
their 500 crores.
 <font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

What is their second condition?

1767
01:37:58,491 --> 01:38:01,281
Their family is a joint family like
in the movie 'Hum Aapke Hain Kyon'.

1768
01:38:01,366 --> 01:38:02,948
They all live together.

1769
01:38:03,032 --> 01:38:05,781
So is our family like in the
movie 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'?

1770
01:38:05,907 --> 01:38:07,156
We stay separately?

1771
01:38:07,241 --> 01:38:10,781
They have never seen yöu
out on a lunch or a picnic..

1772

daughters-in-law.

This tradition has
been going on since ages.

1775
01:38:19,282 --> 01:38:20,781
This is what uncle said as well.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

1776
01:38:20,907 --> 01:38:24,906
That the Chaudharys will never change
their tradition for 500 crores.

Yes.
<font color="#808080">-</font> 500 crores.

Fine. Fine. Listen. Listen.
Henceforth, we'll all be together.

1779

Tell me the condition.

<font color="#808080">-</font> No.

1786
01:38:55,407 --> 01:38:58,656
Even uncle yelled and said no.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes. Yes.

1787
01:38:58,741 --> 01:39:02,156
But what can we do? They hold
the trump card of 500 crores.

1788
01:39:02,241 --> 01:39:04,365
500 crores. 500 crores.

1789

Cut them, Amar.

1790
01:39:06,199 --> 01:39:07,906
yöu can always grow them back.

1791
01:39:08,157 --> 01:39:11,906
But yöu don't often get a
harvest worth 500 crores.

1792
01:39:38,074 --> 01:39:40,448
Great.

1793
01:39:40,532 --> 01:39:42,406

How can he come here?
We don't get along.

What he means is that
their timings don't match.

1814
01:40:25,782 --> 01:40:27,906
He is sometimes out
and he is sometimes in.

1815

These two brothers
love each other a lot.

1816

l said it because yöu have one.

1825
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:53,573
yöu could have said
that he is dead.

yöu are strange.
How could say that?

1827

Till date yöu haven't

But we are dead now.

That old man will
never listen to us.

1831
01:41:02,032 --> 01:41:04,156
Hey, when God gave uncle a
head over his shoulders..

1832
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:05,823
..he didn't give it for decoration.

1833

He will think. He
will think of something.

1834
01:41:07,616 --> 01:41:09,365
He will bring yöur
brother by his ears.

May the face of the one with
ill-intentions in his heart go black!

1843
01:41:24,782 --> 01:41:27,281
Seize the whole place.
Take everyone's mobiles.

1844
01:41:27,366 --> 01:41:28,323
Disconnect their phone.

Yet there is a raid?

1851
01:41:41,491 --> 01:41:42,823
Sir, Ms. Sanjana.

1852
01:41:44,574 --> 01:41:45,615
Hello, uncle Mathur.

1853
01:41:45,699 --> 01:41:47,073
Hello, dear. How are yöu?

1854
01:41:47,157 --> 01:41:50,323
Sanjana, yöu know
these income-tax guys?

1855
01:41:50,574 --> 01:41:52,906
Aunt, they are not from
the income-tax department.

1856
01:41:52,991 --> 01:41:54,240
They are from the World Bank.

1857
01:41:55,074 --> 01:41:57,240
l have heard of Punjab
Bank and Allahabad Bank.

1858
01:41:57,324 --> 01:41:58,156
What is a World Bank?

1859
01:41:58,241 --> 01:42:01,740
The one outside Punjab and
Allahabad is called World Bank.

1860
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:03,323
The father of all banks.

1861
01:42:03,616 --> 01:42:04,948
And the mother of all banks.

1862
01:42:05,032 --> 01:42:06,698
Uncle and aunt of all banks.

1863
01:42:06,782 --> 01:42:08,490
But, sir, what are yöu doing here?

1864
01:42:08,574 --> 01:42:12,073
Ms. Sanjana's father had taken a
loan of 200 crores from our bank.

1865
01:42:12,157 --> 01:42:15,990
So?
<font color="#808080">-</font> So he passed away
before he could settle the loan.

1866
01:42:16,074 --> 01:42:17,948
So?
<font color="#808080">-</font> He keeps on saying 'so'.

1867
01:42:18,032 --> 01:42:19,656
He will lose his mind
when he will hear this.

1868
01:42:20,449 --> 01:42:23,823
So, we have seized all
his property in America.

1869
01:42:23,949 --> 01:42:25,240
We have managed to
get back 100 crores.

1870
01:42:25,324 --> 01:42:27,573
We still need to recover 100 crores.

1871
01:42:27,616 --> 01:42:29,698
But Sanjana doesn't
hold any property here.

1872
01:42:29,782 --> 01:42:31,240
She came here to get married to me.

1873
01:42:31,324 --> 01:42:36,406
Fantastic. After marriage a wife
has equal right over the property.

1874
01:42:36,491 --> 01:42:40,156
Hence, according to law, we
will recover 100 crores from yöu.

1875
01:42:41,241 --> 01:42:43,156
The bungalow itself must
be worth 50-60 crores.

1876
01:42:43,241 --> 01:42:44,656
Come, let's go. Let's go.

1877
01:42:50,574 --> 01:42:53,323
Mr. Lover, l knew that yöu
would get this marriage canceled.

1878
01:42:53,407 --> 01:42:55,198
But what is this
issue of 100 crores?

1879
01:42:55,282 --> 01:42:56,448
Should l tell yöu
everything today itself?

1880
01:42:56,532 --> 01:42:57,615
What's the rush?

1881
01:42:57,657 --> 01:42:58,740
Where are yöu going?

1882
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:00,115
yöu are here.

1883
01:43:00,366 --> 01:43:01,198

1884

Balli, what kind of a law is this?

1885
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:07,573
The law is according to the place.

1886
01:43:07,616 --> 01:43:10,490
Uncle, including this
house and other things..

1887
01:43:10,574 --> 01:43:12,156
..yöu will manage to
arrange 100 crores, right?

1888
01:43:12,782 --> 01:43:16,156
yöu, too, wouldn't
want my deceased father..

1889
01:43:16,241 --> 01:43:17,531

..and formed an
alliance with K.K. Modi.

1904

yöu only had said..
That he is richer..

1916
01:44:18,866 --> 01:44:20,531
..than his elder brother
when it comes to money.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

1917
01:44:20,616 --> 01:44:21,906
Yes. Yes. l said so.

1918
01:44:21,991 --> 01:44:23,906
But what about him?
<font color="#808080">-</font> His daughter.

1919
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:25,865
Daughter.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Daughter.

1920
01:44:25,949 --> 01:44:29,948
His daughter's..
mother will also be there.

1921
01:44:30,032 --> 01:44:31,490
What about his daughter?

1922
01:44:31,574 --> 01:44:34,281
yöu had taken the responsibility
of getting her married.

1923
01:44:34,366 --> 01:44:37,823
Wow, Balli. No matter what yöu
say that's a great condition.

1924
01:44:37,907 --> 01:44:40,323
Not condition, connection.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Whatever.

1925
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:43,198
But tell him Mr. Modi's conditions.

1926
01:44:43,282 --> 01:44:44,698
Yes, ma'am. Coming.

1927
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:47,906
l'll go and check the property.
l'll see how much worth it is.

1928
01:44:49,991 --> 01:44:53,781
Darling Balli, what
conditions do these Modis have?

1929
01:45:01,241 --> 01:45:04,406
"Forgot tradition and became ready."

1930
01:45:04,657 --> 01:45:07,615
"lf they get it right
they will make it big."

1931
01:45:07,699 --> 01:45:11,031
"Money can make yöu do anything."

1932
01:45:11,116 --> 01:45:12,865
Amar!
<font color="#808080">-</font> Brother!

1933
01:45:12,949 --> 01:45:14,656
Brother!

1934
01:45:17,907 --> 01:45:19,698
Where is yöur party?

1935
01:45:19,782 --> 01:45:22,698
Has gone to pickup
yöur party at the airport.

1936
01:45:23,657 --> 01:45:24,865
Where did she come from?

1937
01:45:25,324 --> 01:45:26,865
Did yöu call her?

1938
01:45:27,366 --> 01:45:30,073
lt feels very nice to see the
two of yöu together today, uncle.

1939
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:31,406
Now my problem is also over.

1940
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:34,031
Now both of yöu
decide who l should marry.

1941
01:45:34,116 --> 01:45:37,781
Dear, yöu should forget Veer.

1942
01:45:38,366 --> 01:45:40,490
Last night yöur mother
visited me in my dreams.

1943
01:45:41,157 --> 01:45:45,156
And she said, "Veer isn't
good enough for my Sanjana."

1944
01:45:45,241 --> 01:45:47,948
So the confusion is over. l
will get married to Yuvraj.

1945
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:52,240
No, no, no, no, no, dear.
Yuvraj is absolutely useless.

1946
01:45:52,616 --> 01:45:55,656
yöur mother visited me
in my dreams as well.

1947
01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:57,240
She started crying.

1948
01:45:57,324 --> 01:46:02,698
She said, "Brother,
don't ruin my Sanjana's life.

1949
01:46:03,157 --> 01:46:04,573
More tears.

1950
01:46:04,657 --> 01:46:06,115
What about me?

1951
01:46:06,241 --> 01:46:08,865
Will l stay single all my life?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Not at all, dear.

1952
01:46:08,949 --> 01:46:10,615
We, yöur uncles are there for yöu.

1953
01:46:10,699 --> 01:46:12,323
We will find someone
good enough for yöu.

1954
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,156
Nice, capable and decent.

1955
01:46:14,241 --> 01:46:16,448
We will have a
grand wedding for yöu.

1956
01:46:16,532 --> 01:46:18,073
Why do yöu worry, dear?

1957
01:46:18,157 --> 01:46:19,865
We are there for yöu.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

1958
01:46:20,116 --> 01:46:23,281
Okay, uncle.
Whatever yöu feel is right.

01:46:33,866 --> 01:46:37,656
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

1960
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:42,240
Meet him. He's my yöunger brother..

How are yöu, Ballu?

1965
01:46:52,282 --> 01:46:54,490
Hi, B.K. How are yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu look fit.

1966
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:56,781
l think sister-in-law's
love has played its trick.

1967
01:46:56,866 --> 01:46:58,115
How is sister-in-law, Sakku?

1968
01:46:58,199 --> 01:47:00,323
She's absolutely fine. She
keeps talking about all of yöu.

1969
01:47:00,407 --> 01:47:03,448
How is B.K? What is he doing
these days?
<font color="#808080">-</font> That's fine.

1970
01:47:03,824 --> 01:47:05,865
Mr. Modi, the girls
didn't come with yöu?

1971
01:47:05,949 --> 01:47:08,323
To hell with the girls.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

1972
01:47:08,407 --> 01:47:10,073
He means say hello
to Naina and Sunaina.

1973
01:47:10,157 --> 01:47:13,281
Yes, they are the apple
of their mothers' eyes.

1974
01:47:18,907 --> 01:47:21,240
Naina.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Sunaina.

1975
01:47:22,199 --> 01:47:23,865
They both are great, aren't they?

1976
01:47:25,074 --> 01:47:26,281
Walk straight.

1977
01:47:27,782 --> 01:47:31,406
What are yöu thinking about,
uncle? What are yöu thinking about?

1978
01:47:31,491 --> 01:47:34,323
l couldn't recognize
the other Modi as well.

1979
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:38,740
Uncle, this means it's not
an illness but an imagination.

1980
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:44,365
yöu mean the character l
think about, comes to life?

1981
01:47:44,449 --> 01:47:48,365
Yes. yöu have the power. Otherwise,
how is it possible, uncle.

1982
01:47:49,407 --> 01:47:51,865
What will we call a
person with such imagination?

1983
01:47:54,074 --> 01:47:55,615
We cannot call him human.

1984
01:47:56,199 --> 01:47:59,656
yöu mean l am.. God?

1985
01:48:00,866 --> 01:48:02,115
Brahma.

1986
01:48:02,407 --> 01:48:03,740
The Creator.

1987
01:48:03,949 --> 01:48:05,281
The creator of the universe.

1988
01:48:05,366 --> 01:48:07,906
Balli.

1989
01:48:08,032 --> 01:48:09,240
Look..

1990
01:48:09,866 --> 01:48:12,865
How they address God. ldiots.

1991
01:48:32,491 --> 01:48:34,406
He has regained consciousness.

1992
01:48:34,491 --> 01:48:36,115
Now we will have fun.

1993
01:48:39,907 --> 01:48:43,823
Mr. Chaudhary, he is out of coma,
but he is unable to speak.

1994
01:48:44,241 --> 01:48:45,906
How can he not speak?

1995
01:48:46,032 --> 01:48:48,323
Son.. Tell me, who was he?

1996
01:48:48,407 --> 01:48:49,781
Speak up. Tell me. Who was he?

1997
01:48:49,866 --> 01:48:51,156
Tell me, son.

1998
01:48:53,157 --> 01:48:54,656
Try to speak.

1999
01:48:54,741 --> 01:48:56,156
Try.

2000
01:48:58,241 --> 01:49:01,240
Uncle, why is he
pointing towards yöu?

2001
01:49:01,324 --> 01:49:03,615
Balli. This means yöu..

2002
01:49:03,657 --> 01:49:07,990
No, sir. l cannot even
put a comma to sentence.

2003
01:49:08,116 --> 01:49:09,656
How can l put him into coma?

2004
01:49:09,741 --> 01:49:12,490
Mr. Chaudhary, yöur son
is still not out of coma.

2005
01:49:12,574 --> 01:49:15,823
His mind is spinning hence he is
moving his finger here and there.

2006
01:49:15,907 --> 01:49:18,198
Look, now he is
pointing towards him.

2007
01:49:19,074 --> 01:49:21,615
Mr. Chaudhary, yöur
son's condition is so bad..

2008
01:49:21,657 --> 01:49:23,198
..that he might even
point his finger towards yöu.

2009
01:49:23,282 --> 01:49:26,990
Oh, my. The son is
pointing towards his father.

2010
01:49:27,824 --> 01:49:30,198
Please go out. The
patient is getting hyper.

2011
01:49:30,282 --> 01:49:32,115
Doctor, make my son get well soon.

2012
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:34,323
Because the day he
will come out of coma..

2013
01:49:34,407 --> 01:49:35,948
..someone else will go into coma.

2014
01:49:36,782 --> 01:49:40,323
Let's go.

2015
01:49:41,407 --> 01:49:44,198
There are so many sorrows in
this world. yöur sorrow is so less.

2016
01:49:44,282 --> 01:49:45,490
yöu aren't able to say anything..

2017
01:49:45,574 --> 01:49:46,656
..because of yöur unconscious state.

2018
01:49:46,741 --> 01:49:48,948
And he cannot say anything
even when he is conscious.

2019
01:49:49,032 --> 01:49:51,073
So sad is this and how bad is that.

2020
01:49:51,449 --> 01:49:52,656
Continue.

2021
01:49:53,824 --> 01:49:56,031

01:49:59,116 --> 01:50:00,615
..is having his
breakfast and his lunch.

2025

Mr. Chaudhary, l've been
looking for yöu all over the city.

What a pleasant surprise.

Hello, sister-in-law.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hello, brother.

2033
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:25,573
Sister-in-law, it seems like
yöu have come here on a holiday.

2034
01:50:25,657 --> 01:50:27,115
No, brother.

2035
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:28,990
Our daughters are getting that
with the brothers-in-law.

2036
01:50:29,116 --> 01:50:31,406
They are getting married
with the brothers-in-law.

2037
01:50:31,866 --> 01:50:33,240
Mr. Suraj.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

2038

yöur brother-in-law Veer was
going to marry yöur niece, right?

2039
01:50:36,616 --> 01:50:37,906
No.

2040
01:50:38,241 --> 01:50:40,406
Niece? Who is his niece?

2041
01:50:41,532 --> 01:50:43,240
Here she is. Sanjana.

2042
01:50:43,324 --> 01:50:45,073
She is a very nice girl.

2043
01:50:45,699 --> 01:50:48,990
Why do yöu want to get
related to us instead of her?

2044
01:50:49,074 --> 01:50:52,531
Actually, what happened was..
<font color="#808080">-</font> For Sanjana's happiness.

2045
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:55,115
Sanjana doesn't like
Veer and that's why..

2046
01:50:55,407 --> 01:50:57,698
..Mr. Chaudhary
cancelled the wedding.

2047
01:50:58,074 --> 01:50:59,573
Great people.

2048

Look brother, there is a yöung
unmarried girl in their family.

2051
01:51:07,907 --> 01:51:09,740
And they are getting their
brothers-in-law married.

2052
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:11,698
lt is wrong, isn't it?
<font color="#808080">-</font> True.

2053
01:51:11,782 --> 01:51:14,531
lt is not so. Mr. Chaudhary is
looking for a suitable boy for her.

2054
01:51:14,616 --> 01:51:16,865
He will get her married as
soon as he finds a suitable boy.

2055
01:51:16,949 --> 01:51:19,240
Take yöur time and find a boy.
We are here for four days.

2056
01:51:19,324 --> 01:51:23,906
Look, first Sanjana will get
married then our daughters will.

2057
01:51:24,157 --> 01:51:26,531
But Mr. Modi..

<font color="#808080">-</font> Another condition?

2060
01:51:31,491 --> 01:51:33,448
Don't worry. All the four
Chaudharys are charged.

2061
01:51:33,532 --> 01:51:35,156
They will do something
in four days.

2062
01:51:35,282 --> 01:51:36,615
Great people.

2063
01:51:36,699 --> 01:51:38,656
People, everybody join me please.

2064
01:51:39,824 --> 01:51:47,240
"Whether yöu are a
crescent or the moonlight."

2065
01:51:47,324 --> 01:51:49,573
"No matter what yöu are.."

2066
01:51:49,616 --> 01:51:55,781
"..l swear on God, yöu are great."

2067

Clap, everyone.

2068

Great.

2069
01:52:02,824 --> 01:52:05,448
Brother, the Chaudharys
might get a heart attack..

2070
01:52:05,532 --> 01:52:07,656
..listening to yöur conditions.

2071
01:52:09,032 --> 01:52:12,031
Brother has kept a condition
of Sanjana's wedding.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

2072
01:52:12,116 --> 01:52:16,323
But yöu'll have to give the idea
that our Prem will be her groom.

2073
01:52:16,407 --> 01:52:19,156
This condition has been
kept to give this idea.

2074
01:52:19,241 --> 01:52:21,656
Okay.
<font color="#808080">-</font> But they are
very dangerous people.

2075
01:52:21,991 --> 01:52:23,781
lf they find out the truth..

2076
01:52:25,907 --> 01:52:28,948
There is one person who
is very dangerous. Lehri.

2077
01:52:29,324 --> 01:52:30,448
He is very smart.

2078
01:52:30,532 --> 01:52:32,948
But he has already
said such a big lie..

2079
01:52:33,074 --> 01:52:36,281
..that now if he tells the truth,
he will be the first one to die.

2080
01:52:38,657 --> 01:52:43,156
'Okay, so this is his
family and not the Modi family.'

2081
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:44,490
Mr. Balidaan.

2082
01:52:48,699 --> 01:52:50,698
The poor thing is
standing as a statue.

2083
01:52:51,074 --> 01:52:54,365
Fine, l will bring it into life.

2084
01:52:54,824 --> 01:52:56,573
Brother. Brother. Brother.

2085
01:52:56,616 --> 01:52:59,073
l have come here to
tell yöu a secret.

2086
01:53:12,741 --> 01:53:14,990
Here he is. Here he is.

2087
01:53:15,282 --> 01:53:16,781
yöu are doing pushups?

2088
01:53:17,116 --> 01:53:19,240
No, l'm pushing the ground down.

2089
01:53:19,324 --> 01:53:20,823
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.

2090
01:53:20,907 --> 01:53:22,573
Tell me, who am l?

2091
01:53:22,657 --> 01:53:25,448
Am l God? Am l a
human being? Who am l?

2092
01:53:25,532 --> 01:53:27,948
yöu are the first God with has
been made by this human being.

2093
01:53:28,032 --> 01:53:29,906
What not have yöu made me?

2094
01:53:29,991 --> 01:53:32,365
Now even l have forgotten
who l am.

2095
01:53:32,616 --> 01:53:34,156
l have become the Aamir
Khan in the movie 'Gajani'.

2096
01:53:34,241 --> 01:53:35,490
Look here. Look at this.

2097
01:53:35,574 --> 01:53:38,156
yöu have no idea how difficult
it is to write on yöur back!

2098
01:53:38,241 --> 01:53:39,448
Rascal.

2099
01:53:41,866 --> 01:53:44,698
yöu played such a big
game with a genius like me..

2100
01:53:44,782 --> 01:53:45,990
..who has written
such a famous book?

2101
01:53:46,074 --> 01:53:47,281
Give me the book, please.

2102
01:53:48,366 --> 01:53:49,656
Here yöu go, genius.

2103
01:53:54,574 --> 01:53:56,948
l won't let yöu win
as long as l am alive.

2104
01:53:58,491 --> 01:54:00,073
What will l do?

2105
01:54:00,366 --> 01:54:02,365
Mr. Balli, Mr.
Chaudhary is calling yöu.

2106
01:54:02,449 --> 01:54:04,865
Go. yöu have been summoned.

2107
01:54:06,741 --> 01:54:09,240
Yes. Yes, l've put
the ball in the hole.

2108
01:54:09,324 --> 01:54:10,990
l've learnt to play golf.

2109
01:54:11,074 --> 01:54:13,198
This is how we used to
play marbles as well.

2110
01:54:13,282 --> 01:54:15,823
yöu are right.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Greetings, sir.

2111
01:54:15,907 --> 01:54:18,240
Come. Come, Mr. Balidaan. Come.
<font color="#808080">-</font> yöu summoned me?

2112
01:54:18,324 --> 01:54:20,365
We have known each other since ages.

2113
01:54:20,449 --> 01:54:22,698
Why don't we turn this
acquaintance into a relationship?

2114
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:24,448
l didn't get yöu.

2115
01:54:24,532 --> 01:54:26,490
yöur nephew Prem and
our niece Sanjana.

2116
01:54:26,574 --> 01:54:28,531
Let's get them married.
<font color="#808080">-</font> No.

2117
01:54:29,157 --> 01:54:32,448
No, this marriage cannot
take place.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Why not?

2118
01:54:33,241 --> 01:54:34,615
yöu are a servant.
We are yöur employer.

2119
01:54:34,657 --> 01:54:36,281
yöu don't like the
respect we are giving yöu?

2120
01:54:40,449 --> 01:54:41,948
Why cannot this
marriage take place, uncle?

2121
01:54:42,074 --> 01:54:44,406
We are their loyal servants.

2122
01:54:44,491 --> 01:54:45,906
We have to pay them back
in someway or the other.

2123
01:54:45,991 --> 01:54:47,365
Right, uncle?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Don't touch me.

2124
01:54:48,199 --> 01:54:50,698
yöu see, the girl has a loan
of 100 crores over her head.

2125
01:54:50,782 --> 01:54:52,406
That too of the World Bank.

2126
01:54:52,491 --> 01:54:54,656
Who will pay it back? yöu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> We will pay it back.

2127
01:54:54,699 --> 01:54:56,198
We are going to get
millions from the Modis.

2128
01:54:56,282 --> 01:54:57,656
yöu can keep 100-125 out of it.

2129
01:54:57,741 --> 01:55:00,323
Not 125, only 100 crores.

2130
01:55:00,991 --> 01:55:02,323
The amount of the loan.

2131
01:55:02,782 --> 01:55:04,656
After that even if yöu
sent yöur daughter..

2132
01:55:04,741 --> 01:55:06,615
..without any clothes on,
we will accept her.

2133
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:08,406
Great.

2134
01:55:09,074 --> 01:55:10,990
Right, uncle? We
accept it, don't we?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes.

2135
01:55:12,616 --> 01:55:14,198
Sanjana, my child..

2136
01:55:15,866 --> 01:55:17,490
l accept this match, uncle.

2137
01:55:17,574 --> 01:55:20,906
Uncle, yöur teeth will break
if yöu will grind them so hard.

2138
01:55:21,657 --> 01:55:23,323
Mr. Chaudhary, there is a problem.

2139
01:55:23,407 --> 01:55:25,656
This Lehri keeps
saying that Sanjana..

2140
01:55:25,741 --> 01:55:29,156
..had eloped with a
boy during her wedding.

2141
01:55:29,241 --> 01:55:32,073
lf someone comes to know
about it on my wedding day..

2142
01:55:34,366 --> 01:55:36,240
..then my uncle will be defamed.

2143
01:55:36,324 --> 01:55:38,740
Can yöu please take
care of this Lehri, sir?

2144
01:55:39,074 --> 01:55:41,615
Go and find Lehri.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Get him here.

2145
01:55:45,491 --> 01:55:48,323
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Who eloped with Sanjana?

2146
01:55:48,407 --> 01:55:49,656
This..

2147
01:55:50,699 --> 01:55:52,740
What is this that yöu are asking
me? l had shown yöu the photograph.

2148
01:55:52,824 --> 01:55:54,031
A lie.

2149
01:55:54,907 --> 01:55:56,115
yöu are lying.

2150
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:58,156
He had eloped with Sanjana.

2151
01:55:58,282 --> 01:56:01,115
yöu are right. He
had eloped with her.

2152
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,365
Forgive me, l had lied.

2153
01:56:03,449 --> 01:56:05,323
He is the one l had
given a lift to.

2154
01:56:05,991 --> 01:56:08,406
Henceforth, this is what
yöu should tell everyone.

2155
01:56:08,532 --> 01:56:09,781
Got it?

2156
01:56:11,282 --> 01:56:13,073
Are yöu happy now, Prem?

2157
01:56:13,991 --> 01:56:15,323
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.

2158
01:56:15,532 --> 01:56:18,740
Mr. Lehri, yöu don't
know what a big favour..

2159
01:56:18,824 --> 01:56:22,323
..yöu have done to my
uncle and the Chaudhary family.

2160
01:56:22,907 --> 01:56:25,156
God will surely send
yöu to heaven.

2161
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:30,656
Congratulations, Balli.
yöu became their that.

2162
01:56:30,741 --> 01:56:32,698
What is it? Yes, their relative.

2163
01:56:32,782 --> 01:56:35,656
Mr. Modi, yöu are the
one who gave us this idea.

2164
01:56:35,699 --> 01:56:38,740
Otherwise, how could
we ever think of this?

2165
01:56:39,282 --> 01:56:40,365
Have this.

2166
01:56:40,449 --> 01:56:42,365
Why did yöu unnecessarily
take the that. Trouble.

2167
01:56:42,907 --> 01:56:45,698
yöu go and have yöur meal.
<font color="#808080">-</font> We'll all have together.

2168
01:56:45,907 --> 01:56:47,823
No, we don't know
how long we will take.

2169
01:56:47,907 --> 01:56:50,615
Why should yöu stay that
because of us? Hungry.

2170
01:56:50,657 --> 01:56:52,365
Go, have yöur meal.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.

2171
01:56:52,949 --> 01:56:54,240
l love yöu.

2172
01:56:59,741 --> 01:57:01,073
That's great, Mr. Modi.

2173
01:57:01,157 --> 01:57:04,115
At yöur place the women
eat before the men do.

2174
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:08,531
At our place, till we do eat,
the women will die but..

2175
01:57:08,616 --> 01:57:10,990
..not touch the food.

2176
01:57:12,282 --> 01:57:13,615
This is wrong.

2177
01:57:14,657 --> 01:57:18,448
Look, women live in a
very that world. Small.

2178
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:22,115
lt begins from and ends at us.

2179
01:57:22,532 --> 01:57:24,573
The house and kids.

2180
01:57:24,907 --> 01:57:27,948
She is that in them. What
is it said? Yes, restricted.

2181
01:57:29,199 --> 01:57:32,823
Hence it is our duty
to look after them.

2182
01:57:33,782 --> 01:57:35,156
We should love them.

2183
01:57:35,241 --> 01:57:38,365
We should always keep them that.
We should keep them happy.

2184
01:57:41,699 --> 01:57:43,031
Radhika..

2185
01:57:46,116 --> 01:57:47,406
What happened?

2186
01:57:47,782 --> 01:57:50,281
Nothing. yöu have yöur meal.

2187

<font color="#808080">-</font> So what?

2188
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:58,990
lf l drink all night along ill
yöu stay hungry till the morning?

2189
01:57:59,449 --> 01:58:01,198
What is wrong with yöu, today?

2190
01:58:01,324 --> 01:58:02,698
Love.

2191
01:58:03,407 --> 01:58:04,906
l love yöu.

2192
01:58:07,491 --> 01:58:08,615
Sorry.

2193
01:58:09,449 --> 01:58:10,823
Shalu.

2194
01:58:13,907 --> 01:58:16,656
Shalu?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, Shalani.

2195
01:58:17,074 --> 01:58:20,115
Now l will always call yöu Shalu.

2196
01:58:20,241 --> 01:58:23,823
And henceforth, yöu
can eat before me.

2197

Why so?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Because l love yöu.

Thank yöu.

2199
01:58:33,782 --> 01:58:36,198
Brother, Prem is nowhere to be seen.

2200
01:58:36,657 --> 01:58:39,615
Sanjana is not here either.

2201
01:58:40,032 --> 01:58:42,448
They got what they wanted.

2202
01:58:42,949 --> 01:58:46,490
The lovebirds must be
busy at some corner.

2203
01:58:46,574 --> 01:58:48,490
Yes, so what is wrong in that?

2204
01:58:48,574 --> 01:58:50,823
They both that to each other.
They love each other.

2205
01:58:50,907 --> 01:58:52,156
They are going to get married.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

2206
01:58:52,241 --> 01:58:53,781
Come, let's go and
have some food. Come on.

2207
01:58:53,991 --> 01:58:56,698
Look, Prem and Sanjana
are also back. Come on.

2208
01:58:59,824 --> 01:59:01,990
The bride and the
groom are also here.

2209
01:59:02,949 --> 01:59:05,740
Let me make an announcement.

2210
01:59:06,074 --> 01:59:09,531
l have decided that this
marriage won't take place.

2211
01:59:10,949 --> 01:59:12,240
What?
<font color="#808080">-</font> What?

2212
01:59:15,782 --> 01:59:17,656
Once again uncle must have
gone into the 100 crore loop..

2213
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:18,990
..after having a
little too much to drink.

2214
01:59:19,074 --> 01:59:22,156
Balli, what are yöu saying?

2215
01:59:22,241 --> 01:59:23,948
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.

2216
01:59:24,032 --> 01:59:27,740
yöu are saying Balli
and sacrificing me

2217
01:59:27,824 --> 01:59:29,615
This marriage won't take place.

2218
01:59:29,657 --> 01:59:32,365
lf uncle doesn't want this
marriage to take place then..

2219
01:59:33,324 --> 01:59:36,240
Without uncle, l don't
want to marry like an orphan.

2220
01:59:36,324 --> 01:59:38,656
Since when did yöu
become an orphan, yöu liar?

2221
01:59:38,741 --> 01:59:41,656
Here he is. yöur father is
here in a three-piece suit.

2222
01:59:41,741 --> 01:59:43,656
He is here.

2223
01:59:46,824 --> 01:59:49,656
Fine. Fine. Fine, Ballu.

2224
01:59:49,741 --> 01:59:51,031
lf yöu are breaking
yöur that with him.

2225
01:59:51,116 --> 01:59:52,531
Then l will form a
that with him. What is it?

2226
01:59:52,616 --> 01:59:54,365
Yes, a relationship.

2227
01:59:54,532 --> 01:59:56,490
Henceforth, l am yöur father.

2228
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:58,365
And l am yöur mother.

l'm yöur aunt.

2231
02:00:01,866 --> 02:00:05,115
lf yöu are falling short of relatives
then l, too, shall become one?

2232
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:07,406
Why.. Why would yöu become anyone?

2233
02:00:07,491 --> 02:00:10,115
yöu are his uncle. Keep it fixed.

2234

Then it is fixed.

Uncle, yöu saw how

Yes, uncle.

2246

"My heart is now no longer mine."

2276

Someone stop me.

By the way, Prem..
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes?

..yöur family has bought
for her or to see Sanjana?

2309
02:05:14,824 --> 02:05:16,615
l had come to
congratulate all of yöu.

2310
02:05:16,657 --> 02:05:19,406
This is the first love marriage
taking place in yöur family.

2311
02:05:20,699 --> 02:05:22,365
Aryan.

2312
02:05:22,449 --> 02:05:24,531
yöu came from the
hospital on the right day.

2313
02:05:24,699 --> 02:05:27,906
Come, l'll introduce yöu
to Sanjana's future husband.

Don't yöu want to get ready?
<font color="#808080">-</font> Ready?

<font color="#808080">-</font> l am ever ready.

2316
02:05:32,491 --> 02:05:33,740
Ask Sanjana.

2317
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:36,323
Prem, look who is here.

2318
02:05:49,657 --> 02:05:50,990
He is the one.

2319
02:05:51,324 --> 02:05:52,948
He is the one who
hit me with his car.

2320
02:05:55,657 --> 02:05:57,781
l went into coma because of him.

2321
02:05:57,949 --> 02:06:00,156
He was the one who
eloped with Sanjana.

2322
02:06:00,241 --> 02:06:04,406
Look, Veer, Yuvraj.
Sanjana and Prem love each other.

2323
02:06:04,491 --> 02:06:07,198
That means everyone is a
part of Prem's conspiracy.

2324
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:09,490
l'll take care of yöu later,
yöu wrenched woman.

2325
02:06:10,157 --> 02:06:11,698
We will first..

2326
02:06:12,157 --> 02:06:13,448
..take care of yöu.

2327
02:06:13,532 --> 02:06:14,823
yöu are flying too high.

2328
02:06:15,282 --> 02:06:16,406
Do yöu love to fly?

2329
02:06:16,491 --> 02:06:18,698
Yes, we do.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What will yöu do?

2331
02:06:28,824 --> 02:06:30,240
yöu..

2332
02:06:32,699 --> 02:06:34,531
Where shall l keep it?

2333
02:06:41,949 --> 02:06:44,073
We will have to tell brother-in-law
about his true identity.

2334
02:06:44,157 --> 02:06:46,906
Fools, not the true identity,
but a false one.

2335
02:06:47,699 --> 02:06:51,031
Never underestimate
three things in life.

2336
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:54,031
l, me and myself.

2337
02:06:57,199 --> 02:06:58,365
Thank yöu.

2338
02:06:58,532 --> 02:07:02,698
No one can deport the one
who has the family's support.

2339
02:07:03,407 --> 02:07:07,073
l am someone who can drown a fish.

2340
02:07:07,157 --> 02:07:10,448
What can yöu three.. do to me?

2341
02:07:11,324 --> 02:07:13,656
Go, Veer. Go, Yuvraj.

2342
02:07:14,282 --> 02:07:16,323
l'll see how he stops yöu.

2343
02:07:17,907 --> 02:07:19,823
Let's go.

2344
02:07:20,907 --> 02:07:23,115
yöu are sleeping even
after coming out of coma?

2345
02:07:23,324 --> 02:07:24,615
Do yöu remember yöur name?

Mr. Modi.
<font color="#808080">-</font> What happened?

2351
02:07:46,657 --> 02:07:47,823
We know the truth
about that scoundrel Prem.

2352
02:07:47,907 --> 02:07:49,865
He is not Balli's nephew.

2353
02:07:49,949 --> 02:07:51,740
So?
<font color="#808080">-</font> He isn't the real Modi either.

2354
02:07:51,824 --> 02:07:53,448
He is my real uncle. A Kapoor.

02:07:53,532 --> 02:07:54,698
Uncle.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Yes, nephew.

Aryan, let's go.

02:08:17,116 --> 02:08:18,615
Save us. Save us.

2363

One.. two.. three.

That way. That way.

2368
02:08:56,116 --> 02:08:58,448
Side effects of too much rajma
chawal (a rice dish). Sorry.

2369
02:09:05,657 --> 02:09:06,948
O God!

2370

yöu are a dead man.
We won't spare yöu.

2378
02:11:04,199 --> 02:11:05,698
What's this new drama.

2379
02:11:08,699 --> 02:11:09,948
Bye-bye!

2380
02:11:21,074 --> 02:11:22,281
Amar.

2381
02:11:22,657 --> 02:11:26,698
Sanjana reminds me of
our sister Shibani today.

2382
02:11:27,032 --> 02:11:29,698
Yes, brother. Our
Sanjana looks so happy.

2383
02:11:35,574 --> 02:11:37,865
l'm ready to go to the
moon for her.

2384
02:11:37,949 --> 02:11:39,073
What?

2385
02:11:39,157 --> 02:11:43,115
Uncle, looking at her l
feel that l won't even need..

2386
02:11:43,407 --> 02:11:45,656
..the almond flavoured milk.

2387
02:11:45,699 --> 02:11:46,906
Dad.

2388
02:11:47,199 --> 02:11:49,406
yöu know there is a that.
A custom.

2389
02:11:49,616 --> 02:11:53,656
Yes, but till date l've never
got that of that custom. A need.

Dear good people,
someone stop them.

2393
02:12:24,407 --> 02:12:26,573
Aryan, yöu are back
from the hospital.

2394
02:12:26,657 --> 02:12:29,031
But who did this to yöu?

2395
02:12:29,116 --> 02:12:31,865
That beguiler, Prem.

2396
02:12:56,657 --> 02:12:58,573
We have been cheated
in such a big way.

2397
02:12:58,616 --> 02:13:01,615
Why did yöu do this to us? Why?

2398
02:13:01,657 --> 02:13:04,323
Mr. Chaudhary, this was
Sanjana's mother's desire.

2399
02:13:04,991 --> 02:13:06,865
And there was a belief in her wish.

2400
02:13:06,949 --> 02:13:10,406
Her wish was that yöu
two get Sanjana married..

2401
02:13:10,616 --> 02:13:11,906
..and give her yöur blessings.

2402
02:13:11,991 --> 02:13:13,198
And she believed that..

2403
02:13:13,282 --> 02:13:16,948
..yöu two brothers will
unite because of this marriage.

2404
02:13:17,991 --> 02:13:20,281
That means yöu really
made a fool out of us.

2405
02:13:20,366 --> 02:13:22,115
yöu cheated us with 500 crores.

2406
02:13:22,366 --> 02:13:24,198
That means he is not a Modi.

2407
02:13:24,449 --> 02:13:26,781
And they are yöur uncles.

2408
02:13:26,866 --> 02:13:30,948
Listen, yöu idiots.

2409
02:13:31,116 --> 02:13:32,323
That's what l've been
telling yöu since so long.

2410
02:13:32,407 --> 02:13:33,490
But yöu didn't listen to me.

2411
02:13:33,574 --> 02:13:35,740
yöu didn't listen to me as well.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Then tell them now.

2412
02:13:35,824 --> 02:13:37,406
No, yöu only tell them.

2413
02:13:37,491 --> 02:13:41,906
God sent yöu down here but He
forgot to give yöu any brains.

2414
02:13:41,991 --> 02:13:44,531
yöu didn't change even after
seeing the goodness in him?

2415
02:13:44,616 --> 02:13:46,365
But l have changed.

2416
02:13:46,449 --> 02:13:49,281
From now on l will be
a true uncle to Prem.

2417
02:13:49,574 --> 02:13:51,615
Let me see who tries
to touch my nephew.

2418
02:13:51,699 --> 02:13:52,990
Come on.

2419
02:13:54,366 --> 02:13:55,656
Coming.

2420
02:13:55,741 --> 02:13:56,948
Here yöu go.

2421
02:13:57,032 --> 02:13:58,531
yöu will touch my nephew.

2422
02:13:58,616 --> 02:14:00,156
No, l am here to give
yöu a hand, sir.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Okay.

2423
02:14:00,241 --> 02:14:03,490
Sir, being with them till
date l have only washed cars.

2424
02:14:03,574 --> 02:14:06,406
Being with yöu, l am sure l
will thrash a person or two.

2425
02:14:06,491 --> 02:14:09,823
Great. Great.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Come on,
let's begin the thrashing.

2426
02:14:09,907 --> 02:14:11,906
We are the five good men..

2427
02:14:12,074 --> 02:14:13,865
..and yöu are the two evil uncles.

2428
02:14:14,491 --> 02:14:18,990
Hippo Amar Chaudhary, yöu
will get crushed in their fight.

2429
02:14:19,074 --> 02:14:20,448
Come here.

2430
02:14:21,699 --> 02:14:25,198
Fools, what are yöu
waiting for? Shoot them all.

2431
02:14:29,907 --> 02:14:31,156
We have come to attend the wedding.

2432
02:14:31,241 --> 02:14:33,281
We support love and not hatred.

2433
02:14:33,366 --> 02:14:34,948
Prem has changed us.

2434
02:14:35,824 --> 02:14:38,406
By giving double the money.
Let's go, hired goons.

2435
02:14:40,866 --> 02:14:42,156
Traitors.

2436
02:14:42,241 --> 02:14:43,698
Prem, yöu continue.

2437
02:14:43,782 --> 02:14:45,531
lt's inauspicious to stop
that in the middle. That..

2438
02:14:45,616 --> 02:14:47,490
The wedding vows.
<font color="#808080">-</font> The wedding vows.

2439
02:14:48,907 --> 02:14:50,156
Come on.

2440
02:14:50,574 --> 02:14:52,573
Let's go.

2441
02:14:53,407 --> 02:14:55,448
Priest, hurry up.

2442
02:14:55,532 --> 02:14:57,198
Otherwise, my father and the
rest of them will get thrashed.

2443
02:14:57,282 --> 02:14:58,531
Come. Can l hold it?

2444
02:14:58,616 --> 02:14:59,948
Shall l start walking?

2445
02:15:00,032 --> 02:15:02,656
Come on, son.
Priest, please hurry up.

2446
02:15:03,491 --> 02:15:06,240
l'll shut down yöur World Bank.

2447
02:15:07,491 --> 02:15:09,115
Fast. Fast.

2448
02:15:31,157 --> 02:15:33,281
l'm safe.

2449
02:15:48,824 --> 02:15:49,990
No.

2450
02:15:52,616 --> 02:15:54,656
This will be fine, Choudhary.

2451
02:16:00,032 --> 02:16:01,615
This is too much.

2452
02:16:03,324 --> 02:16:04,573
Prem.

2453
02:16:05,866 --> 02:16:07,448
Prem, yöu can get another wife..

2454
02:16:07,532 --> 02:16:08,865
..but yöu won't get another father.

2455
02:16:09,157 --> 02:16:12,073
Today, for the first time a
woman has said something sensible.

2456
02:16:14,657 --> 02:16:15,948
Go, Prem.

2457
02:17:55,907 --> 02:17:59,073
Prem, yöu won't get a better
chance to remove yöur shirt.

2458
02:17:59,157 --> 02:18:00,948
Show yöur body.
<font color="#808080">-</font> l won't.

2459
02:18:01,032 --> 02:18:03,323
Why?
<font color="#808080">-</font> He has become fat. Fat.

2460
02:18:17,949 --> 02:18:19,656
What shall l say?

2461
02:18:28,199 --> 02:18:29,531
Enjoyed it?

2462
02:18:53,616 --> 02:18:56,698
Mr. Chaudhary, l am
here to form relations..

2463
02:18:57,282 --> 02:18:58,615
..and not to break bones.

2464
02:18:59,532 --> 02:19:01,698
Anyway, at our place we
don't even look into..

2465
02:19:02,241 --> 02:19:03,865
..the eyes of senior citizens.

2466
02:19:04,282 --> 02:19:07,573
Raising a hand on them
is a farfetched thing.

2467
02:19:08,532 --> 02:19:09,865
Hence, chill and relax,
Mr. Chaudhary.

2468
02:19:10,616 --> 02:19:11,781
Chill and relax.

2469
02:19:14,449 --> 02:19:17,073
Saw that? This is what
is called good values.

2470
02:19:17,157 --> 02:19:19,823
But are miles away from it.

2471
02:19:19,907 --> 02:19:22,615
Yes, yöu only know
the meaning of greed..

2472
02:19:22,699 --> 02:19:25,198
..selfishness and deception.

2473
02:19:25,407 --> 02:19:29,073
yöu didn't even bother about
my mother, yöu deceased sister.

2474
02:19:29,199 --> 02:19:31,115
How low will yöu stoop for money?

2475
02:19:31,199 --> 02:19:33,490
My child is absolutely right.

2476
02:19:35,032 --> 02:19:40,365
On one hand this boy is making
sacrifices for his future wife.

2477
02:19:41,199 --> 02:19:43,656
And on the other it's yöu guys..

2478
02:19:44,074 --> 02:19:46,948
..who since ages have been
making yöur wives sacrifice.

2479
02:19:48,074 --> 02:19:49,948
l'm feeling ashamed..

2480
02:19:50,407 --> 02:19:52,031
..to call both of yöu my sons.

2481
02:19:52,116 --> 02:19:53,448
Shame on yöu.

2482
02:19:53,532 --> 02:19:56,531
Disgusting.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Hey old man,
have yöu lost yöur mind.

2483
02:20:01,282 --> 02:20:03,906
Father. Get up, father.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Father..

2484
02:20:06,866 --> 02:20:10,156
Don't yöu dare! He is our father.

2485
02:20:10,241 --> 02:20:12,823
l will cut yöur hand
if yöu even touch him.

2486
02:20:12,907 --> 02:20:15,406
And l will break yöurjaw
if yöu misbehave with him.

2487
02:20:15,491 --> 02:20:18,573
He lied. He cheated everyone.
And yöu are..

2488
02:20:18,616 --> 02:20:20,073
They aren't even Modis.

2489
02:20:20,157 --> 02:20:21,906
What difference does
the name make, son?

2490
02:20:22,116 --> 02:20:24,115
A person is known for his deeds.

2491
02:20:24,199 --> 02:20:28,156
And then, when have we
ever acted like Chaudharys?

2492
02:20:28,616 --> 02:20:31,823
We have instead
demeaned the Chaudhary name.

2493
02:20:31,949 --> 02:20:33,365
They are the real Chaudharys.

2494
02:20:33,449 --> 02:20:35,615
No, we are very
satisfied being Kapoors.

2495
02:20:35,657 --> 02:20:38,323
How can he be a Chaudhary?
He has made us fight.

2496
02:20:38,407 --> 02:20:40,031
Brother-in-law, we
should take revenge from him.

2497
02:20:40,116 --> 02:20:41,990
Revenge for what?

2498
02:20:42,616 --> 02:20:45,615
We should seek revenge
because he made us human?

2499
02:20:45,657 --> 02:20:47,823
We should seek revenge because..

2500
02:20:47,907 --> 02:20:49,990
..by changing
relations he changed us.

2501
02:20:50,366 --> 02:20:53,406
We brothers have
been enemies since ages.

2502
02:20:53,657 --> 02:20:58,948
But today when our father got
hurt our hearts felt the pain.

2503
02:20:59,116 --> 02:21:00,906
Should we seek revenge for that?

2504
02:21:00,991 --> 02:21:03,615
We should learn from this family.

2505
02:21:04,366 --> 02:21:06,531
Just being a part of a family
doesn't make yöu a dear one.

2506
02:21:06,657 --> 02:21:09,865
A member is a dear one
when yöu accept him.

2507
02:21:12,366 --> 02:21:13,740
Sir.

2508
02:21:14,657 --> 02:21:16,031
Sorry. Sir..

2509
02:21:16,574 --> 02:21:18,198
We hold our ears and say..

2510
02:21:18,491 --> 02:21:20,656
..that we will never
act like goons again.

2511
02:21:20,741 --> 02:21:23,031
And we will never
be greedy for money.

2512
02:21:24,157 --> 02:21:25,865
And one more thing, sir.

2513
02:21:26,782 --> 02:21:30,906
Mr. Modi, what is
yöur original surname.

2514
02:21:31,157 --> 02:21:32,698
Kapoor.

2515
02:21:32,866 --> 02:21:37,448
Kapoor.
<font color="#808080">-</font> Mr. Kapoor, please forgive us.

Let us be a part of this wedding
along with our girl, please.
