1
00:01:27,860 --> 00:02:30,340
PRINCE ROGUE {PRAT3!K}

2
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,340
That's 50 liters for Coimbatore,
and 50 liters for Mettupalayam.

3
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,340
Leave at midnight.

4
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,660
-The check post will be unmanned.
-Okay.

5
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,260
I asked for two sacks,
but you're giving me just one?

6
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,860
We go through a lot of trouble
to get this past the check posts.

7
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,300
Just take whatever we give you.

8
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,860
What's that noise?

9
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,940
It's that boy with the long hair.

10
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,220
Tell him to get going.

11
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,580
We'll be in trouble if the cops get here.
Shoo him away.

12
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,860
Turn off that music, boy.

13
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,980
Turn it off and get down.

14
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,580
Give me your phone.

15
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,820
I said, get down.

16
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,700
Your friend is fighting out there.
Take him away.

17
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,900
That guy!

18
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,100
Saravanan, don't hit him.

19
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,700
Let's get out of here.

20
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,900
Saravanan!

21
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,100
Manimaran...

22
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,620
What's that?

23
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,100
The cops are here.
Start the vehicle!

24
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,860
FIFTEEN YEARS LATER.

25
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,620
<span style="style.center_1">-Saravanan, please listen to me.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-Let me go, Mom.</span>

26
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,340
<span style="style.center_1">-You should have given it to me.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-Stop, Saravanan.</span>

27
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,780
<span style="style.center_1">-Hello?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-Tell me, Padma.</span>

28
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,500
<span style="style.center_1">Dear, it's Saravanan.</span>

29
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,340
<span style="style.center_1">He got angry and</span>
<span style="style.center_1">ran away from home.</span>

30
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,460
<span style="style.center_1">-He hasn't returned.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-Don't worry, Padma.</span>

31
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,500
<span style="style.center_1">I'll go look for him.</span>

32
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,700
<span style="style.center_1">Inspector, it's me, Gnanamoorthy.</span>

33
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,780
<span style="style.center_1">My son had a fight at home</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and then, he ran away.</span>

34
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,900
<span style="style.center_1">Can you help me find him?</span>

35
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,220
<span style="style.center_1">Sister!</span>

36
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,900
<span style="style.center_1">Sister!</span>

37
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,940
We may lose this case
in the next hearing.

38
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,260
Why do you think
it will turn in their favor?

39
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,420
They've fabricated the evidence.

40
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,180
They've bribed a lot of people.

41
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,420
How could you say such things?

42
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,100
If you displace people who depend on the
forests to build resorts and cottages,

43
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,220
where will they go?

44
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,980
Sir, they may have lived in
these forests for generations.

45
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,580
But they don't have land deeds.

46
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,020
To hell with the deeds!

47
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,140
They don't ask the wild animals
for deeds, do they?

48
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,740
Sir, don't get angry.

49
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,420
It's an interesting argument,
but won't work in a court of law.

50
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,420
Sir, they are also supported by
the opposition leader Manimaran.

51
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,260
So, the chances of us winning this case
are very slim.

52
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,300
Since the first tree grew on these hills,

53
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,180
since the first flower blossomed here

54
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,780
we've lived right here.

55
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,660
Suddenly someone asks us to leave.

56
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,660
Where would we go?

57
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,980
No one needs to go anywhere.

58
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,580
No one has the authority.

59
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,980
Trust me, you are all
going to stay right here.

60
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,660
We are going to win this case.

61
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,340
Don't be afraid.

62
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,220
-Thanks a lot, sir.
-See you later, sir.

63
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,060
Greetings, ma'am.

64
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,500
What happened, boss?

65
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,220
It's Saravanan's birthday.

66
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,860
Exactly fifteen years since
he left this house.

67
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,300
Parvathy.

68
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,980
Your little brother will come back.

69
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,220
He definitely will.

70
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,660
Out of my way.

71
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,140
You know the court case
is still ongoing.

72
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,620
Why the hell did you--

73
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,460
Why did you start work already?

74
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,860
The verdict is going to be in our favor.

75
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,140
We need to start the construction now, to
complete it in time for the next season.

76
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,540
I'll thrash you!

77
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,060
Leave with your vehicles.

78
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,700
Don't create any trouble.

79
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,260
Or what?

80
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,180
You think you're the only one
backed by people.

81
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,940
I've got backing.
See for yourself.

82
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,220
What's all this?

83
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,660
Forgive me, sir.

84
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,460
I'm living in the constant fear
of our homes getting demolished.

85
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,300
We'd rather just take
whatever handouts they give us.

86
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,260
Azhagu, what's the hurry?

87
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,220
The boss and I are trying to resolve
your issues, all day, all night.

88
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,420
We won't just give up.

89
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,740
Please trust me.

90
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,460
I'm responsible for getting your lands
back to you.

91
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,780
-Your drama won't work here--
-Hey!

92
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,620
Keep talking and I'll slaughter you.

93
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,180
I should have killed you
for what you did to my son.

94
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,900
Why are you here?

95
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,140
Who gave you the permission
to be here?

96
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,020
-Sir, one moment--
-Leave!

97
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,780
Manimaran, you are an educated man.

98
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,580
You know the case is still in courts.

99
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,420
Why have you all gathered here?

100
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
Disperse.

101
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,220
If you cause trouble,
we'll have to charge you.

102
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,220
Uncle, I'll take care of this.

103
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,140
You heard me, get going!

104
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,860
Boss, he'll handle it.
You don't get worked up.

105
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,140
Let's leave.

106
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,740
If something were to happen
to my people

107
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,060
I won't remain quiet.

108
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,980
Do you think you're
like a father to them?

109
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,860
Yes.

110
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,100
I'm their father

111
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,660
leader, and more.

112
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,060
I have a question for you.

113
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,180
You raised a bad son. What makes you
think you can be a father to these people?

114
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,300
Hear me out.

115
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,100
Where is his son?

116
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,420
He ran away!

117
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,900
Fine.

118
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,060
He has a daughter who is
of a marriageable age.

119
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,180
Did he get her married?

120
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,620
He didn't.

121
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,620
Why not?

122
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,860
What did you say?

123
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,340
Take your hands off me.

124
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,900
Fix your home first.
Then you can fix the country!

125
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,020
You ruined my son's life.

126
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,180
Now, you want to ruin
these people's lives.

127
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,700
I won't let that happen.

128
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,980
Uncle, I told you I'll handle this.
You can leave.

129
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,300
-It's beneath us to talk to these people.
-Let's go.

130
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
You're trying to chase us
out of our homes?

131
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,340
-What shall we study today?
-Tell us a story.

132
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,460
Fine, I'll tell you one.

133
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,900
Sit down. Don't make noise.

134
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,180
Which story?

135
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,060
-About the man and the beehive.
-The man and the beehive.

136
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Which one?

137
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,660
-The beehive!
-Okay, sit down.

138
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,380
A man was walking along
the forest path.

139
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,540
A dog that came his way,
started staring at him!

140
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,100
When he picked up a stone to hit it,
the dog fled the place.

141
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,220
He continued walking.

142
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,220
After walking a long distance

143
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
he felt hungry.

144
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,940
At that time, he saw

145
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,460
a honeycomb.

146
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,980
He threw a stone at the beehive.

147
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,100
All the honeybees from the hive
started chasing him.

148
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,900
He started running.

149
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,620
Listen up.

150
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,700
A honeybee is smaller than a dog.

151
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
It's this tiny!

152
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,740
But why did he run away
from the honeybee?

153
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,020
Why?

154
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,780
Because, all the honeybees were united.

155
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,220
Okay.

156
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,580
What's the moral of this story?

157
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,300
He was a real moron.

158
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,900
Why would anyone throw
a stone at the beehive?

159
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,580
He should have just
smoked the bees out.

160
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,980
I mean, what he did was wrong.

161
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,020
There is a certain way to do everything.

162
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,180
Get a chalk piece from there.

163
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,420
-Go.
-Hold this.

164
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,300
Nobody likes to hear the right thing.

165
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,700
In any given situation,
unity is strength.

166
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,620
If we stay united

167
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,140
we can face any danger.

168
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,060
Will you tell this
to your parents?

169
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,700
We will!

170
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,940
My parents will ask you
to set the beehive on fire.

171
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,740
Go, now!

172
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,540
Sir, goodbye!

173
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,700
Bye.

174
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,220
Sister!

175
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,260
Saravanan!

176
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,740
-Give me your hand.
-Sister!

177
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Saravanan, no!

178
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,620
Saravanan!

179
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,180
Yes.

180
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,580
What?

181
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,900
Where?

182
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,580
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

183
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,500
Let's go.

184
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,060
I got in touch with you

185
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,540
after seeing the details you sent
on your son's birthday every year.

186
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,220
It must be about seven years
since we last met.

187
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,380
When we went for another inquiry,

188
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,260
I got a lead about your son.

189
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,140
You said it's been 15 years
since he went missing.

190
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,100
Yes.

191
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,220
Where is he now?

192
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,420
I'll tell you.

193
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,580
But before I get to that,
you need to know a lot about him.

194
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,900
A tour guide?

195
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,380
Not just a guide.

196
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,700
Yeah.

197
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,140
So many frauds here.

198
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,940
-Give us the money.
-Don't hit us!

199
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,820
Out with the money.

200
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,220
-Give me the money.
-One minute.

201
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,020
We didn't manage to
sell anything.

202
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,300
-Let go of me, brother. It hurts.
-Give me the money.

203
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,820
Let go of them!

204
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Who are you?

205
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,380
You are beating up little boys!

206
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,180
Don't you dare touch me.

207
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,660
-I won't spare you.
-Buzz off.

208
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,340
Let me see how you live in Goa.

209
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,860
I'll kill you if I see you
around here.

210
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
I will slaughter you!

211
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,700
I will be around,
do what you can.

212
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,660
Come on.

213
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,500
-Where are the others?
-Inside.

214
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,980
Come in, don't be scared.

215
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,660
So? What are you kids up to?

216
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,540
Boys!
This will be your home from now on.

217
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,060
You can live here.
Okay?

218
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,460
-Thank you.
-Okay.

219
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,180
-What's your name?
-Can we play with you?

220
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,420
-What?
-Give it to us, man.

221
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,900
-These are US dollars!
-Yes, give it to us.

222
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,660
I'll whack you!
You overacted anyway.

223
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,620
Get out!

224
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,940
Vicky, you've crossed swords with me.
You will regret it.

225
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,340
Piglets speaking punchlines now!
Scram!

226
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,100
Run!

227
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,180
You scam the kids as well?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

228
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,740
Why did you rip my shirt?
It was brand new.

229
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,420
All this for a cheap t-shirt?

230
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,420
Buzz off.

231
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,700
I've told you several times

232
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,340
hit me softly,
and I will run away.

233
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,980
Why did you punch my stomach?

234
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,020
Dude, when you play a character
you have to transform into the character.

235
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,380
They are foreigners.
They aren't easy to fool.

236
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,220
Performance is very important.

237
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,180
What now?

238
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,500
Leftover booze and fish gravy, right?

239
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,700
<span style="style.center_1">Hello, sir! I'll take you for a ride</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I'll steal every last dime</span>

240
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,420
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, damn you and your mores</span>
<span style="style.center_1">It's the code of cadavers</span>

241
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,260
<span style="style.center_1">Sorry, sir! I'm gonna live blindfolded</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Bend over, and you'll get hoodwinked</span>

242
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,060
<span style="style.center_1">Emotions are illusions</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What's a flower in a monkey's hand?</span>

243
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,660
<span style="style.center_1">In this life,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Money is our greatest need</span>

244
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,420
<span style="style.center_1">I want the rupees, rupees, rupees!</span>

245
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,900
<span style="style.center_1">Eat your kill to absolve the sin</span>

246
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,820
<span style="style.center_1">Every cell in my body is a beast</span>

247
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,060
<span style="style.center_1">To live this life, I need money</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To die, I need money</span>

248
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,100
<span style="style.center_1">After I'm dead and gone</span>
<span style="style.center_1">You'll find my ashes in an auction</span>

249
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,420
<span style="style.center_1">To come along, I need money</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To go away, I need money</span>

250
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,260
<span style="style.center_1">My tears will reach out</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And ask for a cash payment</span>

251
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:22,420
<span style="style.center_1">No matter who falls</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I don't care</span>

252
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,380
<span style="style.center_1">I must live and thrive</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That's my prerogative</span>

253
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,940
<span style="style.center_1">No matter who suffers</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I don't care</span>

254
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,660
<span style="style.center_1">I must laugh and rejoice</span>

255
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,300
<span style="style.center_1">That's my choice</span>

256
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,260
<span style="style.center_1">The pleasure of plundering is all I seek</span>

257
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,420
<span style="style.center_1">Your treasure chest</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Will make history speak</span>

258
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,020
<span style="style.center_1">I'm not a fool to preach benediction</span>

259
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,460
<span style="style.center_1">I only want self-gratification</span>

260
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,540
<span style="style.center_1">In this life,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Money is our greatest need</span>

261
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,220
<span style="style.center_1">I want the rupees, rupees, rupees!</span>

262
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,660
<span style="style.center_1">Eat your kill to absolve the sin</span>

263
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,500
<span style="style.center_1">Every cell in my body is a beast</span>

264
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,620
<span style="style.center_1">To live this life, I need money</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To die, I need money</span>

265
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,820
<span style="style.center_1">After I'm dead and gone</span>
<span style="style.center_1">You'll find my ashes in an auction</span>

266
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,300
<span style="style.center_1">To come along, I need money</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To go away, I need money</span>

267
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,060
<span style="style.center_1">My tears will reach out</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And ask for a cash payment</span>

268
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,860
<span style="style.center_1">Who's that? My girl?</span>

269
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,100
<span style="style.center_1">See you.</span>

270
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,260
Mr. Conscience?

271
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,260
I was wondering
why you hadn't turned up yet.

272
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,540
I've told you several times

273
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,020
do not get emotionally attached
to a client.

274
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,700
Bro, this isn't my client.
She is my fan!

275
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,020
Oh!

276
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,660
Well, listen.

277
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,060
Don't trust women.

278
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,700
Something like this will get you caught.

279
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,540
Zip your mouth.
Don't jinx it!

280
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,820
She is peacefully asleep.
What could she do?

281
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,940
You are just jealous!

282
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,140
You are incorrigible.

283
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,540
-You're definitely getting the cuffs.
-Shut up.

284
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,140
Cut that negative talk.

285
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,900
I've got plenty of work to do.
Go away.

286
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,180
You go away!

287
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,060
Go away!

288
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,980
Go!

289
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,620
<span style="style.center_1">Beauty from the hills of Oory</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What's your name, girl?</span>

290
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,820
<span style="style.center_1">Yeah, hit that, man</span>
<span style="style.center_1">My name is Fathima!</span>

291
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,620
-Yes, sir.
-Yes!

292
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,860
-Hey, who is it?
-Someone has barged in!

293
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,700
-Stop!
-Get lost.

294
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,260
Stop!

295
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,460
Thought you could
take the police for a ride?

296
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,980
Mom.

297
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
Dad!

298
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,740
Oh, no!

299
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,380
Because of the head injury,
he has regained his old memories.

300
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,740
Is he speaking the truth?

301
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
Or, is this just another plan?
We don't know.

302
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,180
That's why I asked you
to come here.

303
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,380
What did you say his name was?

304
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,500
A new name for every new case.

305
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,300
Vicky. Guru.

306
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,860
Arjun. Michael.

307
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,100
And several more!

308
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,220
Is he...

309
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,020
such a big criminal?

310
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,900
This is our Saravanan!

311
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,140
Sorry, Dad.

312
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,020
I made a mistake.

313
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,100
Wait a minute, sir.

314
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,260
Boss, please don't misunderstand me.

315
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,140
Let's not act in haste.

316
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,540
I think this might be another scam.

317
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,060
Yes, sir.

318
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,540
He is very dangerous.

319
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,580
He is a big fraud.

320
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,020
Let's do a DNA test to make sure--

321
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,740
Sir, run any test you want.

322
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,820
A father can recognize his son.

323
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,780
I know he is my son, Saravanan.

324
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,180
I'll take him with me.

325
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,580
Proceed with all the
formalities required, please.

326
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,900
Padma, Saravanan is here.

327
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,340
Welcome, sir.

328
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,780
-Oh, he is all grown up!
-It's been so many years.

329
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,500
Bless his kind soul!

330
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,180
Saravanan, come on!

331
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,420
His face hasn't changed one bit.

332
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,220
He's here now.

333
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,020
Let's get on with the ritual.

334
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,820
Welcome home.

335
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,740
Come in.

336
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,260
Come in, everyone.

337
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,460
Karan, why are you standing outside?
Come in.

338
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,860
Saravanan!

339
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,380
-Karan is here.
-How are you?

340
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,260
Dude, don't you recognize me?

341
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,900
It's been so many years...

342
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,780
He was your classmate.

343
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,340
He is the police inspector
at Mettupalayam.

344
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,420
Everyone is here

345
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,820
but your sister is missing.

346
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,260
You know Parvathy.

347
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,860
She is still sulking about the fact
that he ran away from home as a child.

348
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,860
Things will be better
when she sees you.

349
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,660
Uncle, the SP is calling me.

350
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,700
-I'll be back.
-Sure.

351
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,660
-Saravanan, I'll see you.
-All of you must eat.

352
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,780
He is the leader.

353
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,420
Where are you going?

354
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,700
-We need to meet your teacher.
-You can't.

355
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,460
A class is going on.
I can't allow anyone in.

356
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,300
Wait until I ring the bell
for a leak break.

357
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,620
When will you ring the bell?

358
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,860
When I want to take a leak!

359
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,980
Go and tell your teacher
that her brother is here.

360
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,980
Is he her brother?

361
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,620
She has specifically instructed me not to
allow anyone who claims to be her brother!

362
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,580
Buzz off.

363
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,060
You talk a lot. Step aside!

364
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,100
Please wait.

365
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,700
You know our daughter.

366
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,500
Time will fix everything.

367
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,820
Saravanan.

368
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,820
Do you remember your room?

369
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,580
Look at your music system.

370
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,620
You really fought for it!

371
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,020
The sister has kept the room clean
in her brother's absence.

372
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,580
Don't mind her.

373
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,140
Why are you yapping away?

374
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,420
Take a shower and get some rest.
I'll call you when the food is ready.

375
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,340
-I've left a fresh towel.
-You should stop yapping!

376
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,500
See you.

377
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Dude.

378
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,180
What?

379
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
What's going on?

380
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,420
How was my performance?

381
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,660
I convinced everyone
within an hour.

382
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,500
I should be acting in Mani Ratnam's films!

383
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,420
My foot!

384
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,580
-What?
-Did you notice the sister?

385
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,260
She didn't pay any heed to you!

386
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,380
She is the big shot
in this house.

387
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,620
She needs to believe you.

388
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,740
This is the first time you've
said something useful.

389
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,660
I agree.

390
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,860
You always share a special bond
with the policemen.

391
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,660
There is one here as well.
He will dig really deep.

392
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
Bro, say something encouraging!

393
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,180
Don't create havoc.

394
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,340
All you have is a tiny bit of news.

395
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,060
How long can you manage
with that?

396
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,180
He disappeared 15 years ago!
What can I know about him now?

397
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,940
Fool, you are in his room.

398
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,140
Start looking.

399
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,140
That's right!

400
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,380
Small size.

401
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,580
The boy wasn't like me.
He was thin.

402
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,780
He is a Michael Jackson fan.

403
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,420
A dancer, just like me.

404
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,820
Yuck.

405
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,940
Let's see what he's got.

406
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,060
Rich boy's love letter.

407
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,820
Sanjana.

408
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,620
He had a lover.

409
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,100
The guy who ran away had a lover!
But I don't.

410
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,300
He did because he could.
Get to work.

411
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,460
His marks are in single digits.

412
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,980
He was weak at studies.

413
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,220
That's all we've got.

414
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,620
I can't find anything more.

415
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,940
Is this all you've got?

416
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,540
What are you going to do now?

417
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I don't have to work too hard.
I need to let the others talk.

418
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,780
They've been separated for many years.
So, they will talk a lot.

419
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,220
For them, it's emotion.

420
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,460
For us, it's information.

421
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,700
I just need to act
according to the information.

422
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,500
For how long?

423
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,420
I can't stick around for too long, bro.

424
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
I need to loot a big amount
and be on my way.

425
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,700
Easier said than done.

426
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,380
You've got two problems here.

427
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,340
A rough cop out there.

428
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,140
A tough sister in here.

429
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,620
You need to convince both of them.

430
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,340
If it were that easy,
anybody could do it.

431
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,180
I'm going to make them admit
that I am Saravanan.

432
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,460
Trust me!

433
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,420
You are not Saravanan!

434
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,300
Buzz off.

435
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,260
Why is she staring at me?

436
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,900
Did she overhear everything?

437
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,540
Mother-in-law.

438
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,460
Mother-in-law, here you are.

439
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,180
What's with that look?

440
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,660
She is your grandmother.

441
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,340
Grandma is still alive!

442
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,420
Where does she live?

443
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,140
Mother-in-law, do you recognize him?

444
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,020
Your grandson, Saravanan.

445
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,100
What happened to her?

446
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,260
She got paralyzed.

447
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,460
-She can't speak.
-Perfect.

448
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,660
-She can't hear, either.
-Perfect.

449
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,060
How did this happen?

450
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,500
Let's talk about it later.

451
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,700
Take a shower and freshen up.
Let's eat.

452
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
Hurry up.

453
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,940
For a second there
I got really scared.

454
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,020
-That's enough, Mom.
-Eat some more.

455
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,260
It's been so many years

456
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,140
since I've pampered my son with food.

457
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,220
Eat.

458
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,420
Where is my sister?

459
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,740
She is still angry.

460
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,340
She is really grumpy.

461
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,420
I'll go and get her.

462
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,220
No way!

463
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,460
She isn't going anywhere.

464
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,540
She will have a change of mind
and come to you.

465
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,540
Yes, son.
You should just--

466
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,140
Padma.

467
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,660
Mother wants some water.

468
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,180
Grandma never asked for water.

469
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,300
She can't talk anymore.

470
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,100
But she makes sure we understand
what's on her mind.

471
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,220
Can she understand what we're speaking?

472
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,700
She can't hear.

473
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,340
But she can read our lips
and know exactly what we're saying.

474
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,460
<span style="style.center_1">I need to be wary of this one.</span>

475
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,940
Did I scare you?

476
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
I was just curious
to see what you were up to.

477
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,700
Show it to me.

478
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,460
Come on, show it to me.

479
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,860
Oh, you're learning to write!

480
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,340
E isn't the first letter in the alphabet.

481
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,900
A comes first.

482
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,580
Then comes B and C.

483
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,060
E comes after D!

484
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,300
Do you want some water?

485
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,820
You don't?

486
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,820
Okay, I'm going to sleep.

487
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,340
I'm very tired!

488
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,100
The old lady doesn't suspect anything.

489
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,540
Stop it!

490
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,780
Is this a nightclub?

491
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,140
We need to sleep.

492
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,100
I didn't say anything because
everyone is happy about your arrival.

493
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,700
Is she his sister?

494
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,260
Tough one!

495
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,060
Dear God!

496
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,260
Your son has returned.

497
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,980
Only good things will happen henceforth!

498
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,180
What are you gawking at?

499
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,620
Don't you recognize me?

500
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,860
It's me.

501
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,540
-San--
-Sanjana, yes!

502
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,820
You've changed.

503
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,780
You've grown so tall.

504
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
I was at the camp in Hyderabad.

505
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,580
When I heard you came back,
I rushed here to see you.

506
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,700
I heard you got hurt.

507
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,180
I've got memory problems.

508
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,820
That's not a problem.
I'm here now.

509
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,980
I'm a doctor.

510
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,700
When did you get here, doctor?

511
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,780
This morning.

512
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,180
Did he recognize you?

513
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,740
No, Uncle.
He forgot me.

514
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,380
You said you were coming
by tonight.

515
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,420
I managed to catch the
morning flight, Dad.

516
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,300
Let's go.

517
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,340
Stop! Where are you going?

518
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,380
Dad!

519
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,140
We have lots to talk about.
Let's go out.

520
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,540
-Sanjana.
-Coming, Dad.

521
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,700
See you this evening. Bye!

522
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,860
I thought I only had two problems.

523
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,980
But now, a third problem has arrived.

524
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,140
Oh, it's you.

525
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,580
Who else would hug you
like that?

526
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,700
It's been so long since I saw you!

527
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,740
So long since I hit you,

528
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,740
-pinched you, and played with you!
-Sanjana!

529
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,540
I have no memory of the past.

530
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,700
I'm remembering things slowly.

531
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,100
I can understand how difficult
this must be for you.

532
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,420
But I am very happy to see you,
I don't know what to do.

533
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,140
Fine.

534
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,020
When you spend time
with people you like

535
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,980
you will slowly remember the past.

536
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,500
I'll come to see you every day.

537
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,900
Let's talk a lot.

538
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,100
-I'll take you out.
-Okay.

539
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,780
Everything will be fine, okay?

540
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,820
You don't remember the past.

541
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,860
But you are still my Saravanan.
And I'm your Sanjana.

542
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,420
That won't change.

543
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,300
Sanjana?

544
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,220
I need to check Uncle's BP.
I'll be back.

545
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,860
We don't have permission
to build over three floors.

546
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,700
So, we've designed it to have
two floors under the ground.

547
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,500
Sir, I understand everything.

548
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,700
This isn't something we just started.

549
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,740
It isn't the best idea
to discuss this now.

550
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,500
It's very difficult to
get this project through,

551
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,380
as long as Gnanamoorthy
is around.

552
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,900
The people obey him.

553
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,940
Sir, the case is dragging on and on
at the Supreme Court.

554
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,300
The local people are
also complicating things

555
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,060
by going into the forests to
harvest honey and collect firewood.

556
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,660
If they enforce some
tribal right to the land,

557
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,180
and the court verdict is in their favor,
what do we do then?

558
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,220
That's why we must be patient.

559
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,420
We are going to win
the upcoming elections.

560
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,700
After the elections,
I'll get this done for you.

561
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,780
Boss.

562
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,580
Gnanamoorthy's son, Saravanan,
has returned.

563
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,540
Saravanan?

564
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,500
Yes, boss.

565
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,460
Manimaran!

566
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,860
He's alive?

567
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,180
You fraud!
What are you doing out there?

568
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,180
Nothing.

569
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,220
Come in.

570
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,740
Pass me the sugar.

571
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,820
Is this why you called me?

572
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,540
You weren't doing anything!
Pass it to me.

573
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,020
That's a bottle of salt.

574
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,580
Each family member has a preference
when it comes to tea.

575
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,620
Uncle likes it with less sugar.

576
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,860
Auntie likes black tea.

577
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,140
My father likes light tea.

578
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,580
Your sister?
She likes it double strong.

579
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,540
Right!

580
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,260
She is double strong
at everything.

581
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,980
Pride, anger.

582
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,420
Why is she so angry?

583
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,860
What do you expect?

584
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,780
You just ran away from home.

585
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,180
After you were born, your mother
was in the hospital for a year.

586
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,820
Your father was busy with the people
and his politics.

587
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,580
Your sister raised you.

588
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,860
Imagine how she must have felt.

589
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,500
If I were in her place,
I'd have killed you.

590
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,500
Oh, no.
The salt has spilled.

591
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,260
They will say that it's a bad omen.

592
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,140
If my father comes to know,
he will not spare me.

593
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,820
-He always yells at me.
-Shall I serve the tea?

594
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,980
Sure, go ahead.
I'll clean up this mess.

595
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,580
No idea how it spilled!

596
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,500
God, hope nothing goes wrong today.

597
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,420
Less sugar for Dad.

598
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,340
Black tea for Mom.

599
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,740
Light tea for Uncle.

600
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,260
Superb!

601
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,900
Saravanan, the tea is fantastic.

602
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,540
I make really good tea.
I worked at a tea shop for a year.

603
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,420
Don't you get an important post
and make us learn an alien language.

604
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,020
That will never work in Tamil Nadu!

605
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,420
Double strong tea.

606
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,860
Where is my sister?

607
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,740
Miss, can I say something?

608
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,700
I don't like the sight of your brother.

609
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,140
Why?

610
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,460
The guy looks like a
thief who steals goats.

611
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,900
Hey!

612
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,900
That wasn't respectful.

613
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,100
That gentleman looks like
a thief who steals goats.

614
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,620
Yeah, you tell me.

615
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,100
That look on his face,

616
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,100
like he stole a few goats,
and came here to hide from the police.

617
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,900
You talk a lot!

618
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,740
Parvathy!

619
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,580
-Go in. I'll join you.
-Okay.

620
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,660
Sister, have a seat.

621
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,580
Yes, Uncle?

622
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,820
Your little brother has made tea for you.

623
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,180
Drink it.

624
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,700
Take it.

625
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,740
You spoke a lot about him
in his absence.

626
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,820
Now, you won't say
"hello" to your brother.

627
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,220
What do you want me to say?

628
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,860
He ran away from home
15 years ago, and

629
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,260
suddenly he turns up from nowhere
and claims to be my brother.

630
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,700
Should I coddle him?

631
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,940
Her anger is justified, Uncle.

632
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,660
After I was born,
Mom was in the hospital for a year.

633
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,700
It was my sister
who took care of me.

634
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,020
And I just disappeared without a word.

635
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,580
Of course, she's angry.

636
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,540
The tea is terrible.

637
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,380
Saravanan!

638
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,700
Why did you come here?

639
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,420
I heard that Saravanan is back.

640
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,660
You can't see him.
Go away.

641
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,860
I just want to see him.

642
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,620
Manimaran, don't create trouble.
Just leave.

643
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,580
-I didn't create any trouble.
-You heard him. Just go.

644
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,580
Mom, who is this?

645
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,980
Manimaran.

646
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,980
I hate the sight of his face.

647
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,580
Makes me want to
beat him to death.

648
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,060
He was the one
who ruined your life.

649
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,180
Mom, step aside.

650
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,500
You said I was the one
who ruined him.

651
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,340
-Let me find out from him myself.
-I said, leave this place.

652
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,100
Manimaran!

653
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,060
Why did you come here?

654
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,380
-Get out of here!
-Saravanan, what's wrong with you?

655
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,940
You destroyed my life,
what more do you want?

656
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,500
-Get out!
-Listen to me.

657
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,460
I was away from my parents
because of you.

658
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,420
-Come on, Saravanan!
-Just get out.

659
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,660
You are the reason my sister
refuses to talk to me.

660
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,420
-Get out.
-I am your friend.

661
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,780
No, you are a traitor.

662
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,100
A traitor who ruined my life.
Get out of here!

663
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,900
You hit me.

664
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,700
I'll sort you out.

665
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,780
Start the car!

666
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,020
Get going.

667
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,980
Don't come back!

668
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,580
Did I go overboard?

669
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,340
Everyone is staring at me.

670
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,940
I'll handle it.

671
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,100
Grandma!

672
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,940
You are rushing out
like the school bell just rang.

673
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,820
I've never seen a more sincere student.

674
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,660
Do you hold onto that slate
when you go to sleep?

675
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,300
Show me.

676
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,220
"He is not..."

677
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,300
What is this?

678
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,340
Are you trying to say something?

679
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,900
You're struggling to speak your mind,
and I'm struggling to read your mind!

680
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,580
You asked me where your
sister goes every morning.

681
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,780
This is the place.

682
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,260
Now you've seen it.
Let's leave.

683
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,460
Wait, my sister rides the horse so well.
Let's watch.

684
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,260
Sister, superb!

685
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,780
She isn't the same person, right?
She has changed a lot.

686
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,500
All this won't mollify her.

687
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,140
Son!

688
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,700
Do you remember me?

689
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,700
Your beard has turned all white.

690
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,220
You look almost--

691
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,860
Uncle!

692
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,300
-Uncle Marimuthu!
-Uncle Marimuthu?

693
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,620
-Yes, it's me.
-Uncle Marimuthu!

694
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,380
-Welcome back.
-How are you?

695
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,700
Are you doing well?

696
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,340
You remember me!

697
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,460
How could I ever forget?
You taught me horseback riding.

698
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,420
Right!

699
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,940
You grabbed my shirt and roughed me up
because I touched your horse once!

700
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,940
-I meant that!
-Oh!

701
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,060
I hated it when
someone touched my horse.

702
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,340
How are you, buddy?

703
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,500
I missed you sorely.

704
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,900
Son, your horse died.

705
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,900
It died?

706
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,500
It was the same color,
so I got confused.

707
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,540
That was a white horse.

708
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,140
White?

709
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,540
I forgot everything.

710
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,060
Son, let's go for a ride.

711
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,100
-No, Uncle. I'm heading out.
-Come on!

712
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,060
You wanted to go out?

713
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,500
It's just a ride.
I can wait!

714
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,820
She doesn't mind. Come on.

715
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,860
-She wanted to go somewhere urgently.
-Come on!

716
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,780
-Come on, just one ride.
-Some other day, Uncle.

717
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,180
-No, Uncle.
-Mount it.

718
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,460
Now you look like a king.

719
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,500
-It isn't moving.
-Give it a good tap. It will move.

720
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,540
The horse doesn't like me.

721
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,540
-I should get off.
-Cut the act, son.

722
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:05,940
I'm horseback riding!

723
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,020
Alex.

724
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,020
Uncle Marimuthu!

725
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,300
-He rides in style!
-Uncle Marimuthu, help me!

726
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,660
Uncle Marimuthu!
Uncle, save me.

727
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,140
Uncle Marimuthu!

728
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,140
It's very fast.
Please save me!

729
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,500
Uncle!

730
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,500
Son!

731
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,820
Oh, no.

732
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,060
<span style="style.center_1">It's a cruel world...</span>

733
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,860
That was some torture!

734
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,740
How do you feel now?

735
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,700
Exactly the same.

736
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,140
No one cares about me.

737
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,460
Do you get it now?
Only I will always be there for you.

738
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,780
I saw the x-rays.

739
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,060
It's not a fracture.
Just some swelling.

740
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,100
I'll get some hot water.

741
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,220
Kid.

742
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,620
A gentleman has been injured.

743
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,740
How dare you laugh at him?

744
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,580
Don't you want to know
what happened?

745
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,900
What happened?

746
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,260
-I can't tell you.
-Then why did you call me?

747
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,820
-You deserve this.
-Kid!

748
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,660
Didn't she teach you
how to respect elders?

749
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,020
Didn't your teacher teach you that?

750
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,780
I'm in terrible pain. Just walk away.

751
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,620
Does it hurt here?

752
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,300
Oh, God!

753
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,460
Little devil!

754
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,060
The eight-year-old boy and the
80-year-old granny, both are dangerous.

755
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,580
Where have your parents gone?

756
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,460
No idea.

757
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,020
Don't shout.
Hot water will make it all better.

758
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:56,100
Here you are!
What happened to you?

759
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,700
I fell off while I was horseback riding.

760
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
But you are the king of horseback riding!

761
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,140
I've lost touch.

762
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,900
I would have managed a horse,
but that was a donkey!

763
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,580
-Hi, Karan.
-Sister?

764
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,420
-You're busy these days.
-Oh, yes.

765
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,180
I couldn't visit Saravanan.

766
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,540
So, I took the day off.

767
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,540
Let's go out.

768
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,500
No way. He is hurt.

769
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,780
But I'll be with him.
We'll be traveling in the jeep.

770
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,940
-My leg hurts.
-You heard him.

771
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,260
Stepping out will increase the swelling,
and he won't be able to walk for a week.

772
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,380
-Sanjana?
-Sister!

773
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,340
Come here.

774
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,620
Stay here. I'll be back.

775
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,500
Okay, let's go.

776
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,380
I can carry you!

777
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,900
I can manage.

778
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,420
Why are you laughing?

779
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,820
There's no reason.

780
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,700
You were thinking about something.

781
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,980
I was thinking about
our childhood days.

782
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,700
Like what?

783
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,340
Like what?

784
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,300
When we played games

785
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,100
you were the thief
and I was the cop.

786
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,780
And now, you are the cop
and I am--

787
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,140
You are?

788
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,460
I'm still the same old Saravanan!

789
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,180
<span style="style.center_1">Don't go inviting trouble.</span>

790
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,100
-Get down.
-Here?

791
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,700
Why?

792
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,820
Do you remember this place?

793
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,020
I do.

794
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,060
Looks like a forest.

795
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,860
We used to come here every day
after school.

796
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,980
Really?

797
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,420
I can't believe it.

798
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,580
It's totally changed.

799
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,980
Things do change in 15 years!

800
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,700
Remember, we came here all sad
after our 8th grade exams?

801
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,860
Were we sad?

802
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,700
Were we sad because we
didn't do well in the exams?

803
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,580
I cried because I thought I'd fail.

804
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,620
You were such a cry baby,

805
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,140
you cried over everything!

806
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,980
Was it the science exam,
or the math exam?

807
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,900
Math.

808
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,860
We were terrible at math!

809
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,900
Do you remember our math teacher?

810
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,420
<span style="style.center_1">He's relentless.</span>

811
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,180
He was dark-skinned,
wore glasses...

812
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,700
That guy with a belly?

813
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,180
That's Navaseelan.

814
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,860
Our Math teacher was Ms. Jothi.

815
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,820
She hit us hard!

816
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,420
Oh, yes, Jothi!
I remember her now.

817
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,380
She used to whack us.

818
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,420
You feared the exam results and said that
you'd board a train and leave for Mumbai.

819
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,380
Then, I stopped you.

820
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,980
As a child, I've always wanted
to go to Mumbai by train.

821
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,460
It must have been futile to stop me.

822
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,620
I ended up going to Mumbai.

823
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,580
Don't keep thinking about the past.
Let it go.

824
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,740
Hey.

825
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,220
Who are you?

826
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,660
It's me.

827
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,580
Saravanan.

828
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,980
Why did you slap me?

829
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,380
Karan!

830
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,620
He never called me Karan.
He called me by my nickname "Bonda."

831
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,980
Bonda, it's me.
Saravanan!

832
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,780
-Trust me.
-I never came here with him.

833
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,660
He is terrified of train sounds.
It made him faint.

834
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,900
Tell me, who are you?

835
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,020
Stop putting up an act.
Get up!

836
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,020
Hey!

837
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,100
Give me that.

838
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,340
I saw his old reports.

839
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:58,780
Sir, don't pressurize an amnesia patient
asking him if he remembers things.

840
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,940
He was terrified of train sounds.
as a child.

841
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,100
Maybe he forgot about it now.

842
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,460
Why did you trigger his memory?

843
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,300
-Doctor, how do you--
-Karan.

844
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,300
Come outside.

845
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,420
Okay.

846
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,380
Take it to B12.

847
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,500
-Karan, what's your problem?
-I know--

848
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,780
He doesn't like me spending
quality time with Saravanan.

849
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,060
Sanjana, that's not the reason.

850
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,100
I'd be very happy
if he were the real Saravanan.

851
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,220
He is a fraud.

852
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,140
Karan.

853
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,460
I understand you care about our family.

854
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,100
You are suspicious about him.

855
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,180
But Mom and Dad have been happy and
at peace ever since he came home.

856
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,980
-Sister--
-Don't ruin that.

857
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,020
Sister...

858
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,460
Won't you ask me anything?

859
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,620
Why haven't you married yet?

860
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,580
Actually, I got a lot of proposals.

861
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,380
But I've been waiting for an idiot.

862
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,340
Did you ever think about me
in all these years?

863
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,460
So, this estate
belongs to my father?

864
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,220
Yeah.

865
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,340
How many acres approximately?

866
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,580
Around 1,000 acres.

867
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,900
Oh, wow!

868
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,100
What's the price of an acre here?

869
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,380
Do I look like a real-estate broker
to you?

870
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,700
I was just curious.

871
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,860
Stop the car.

872
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,340
Pull over!

873
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,180
-Sanjana.
-I said, stop!

874
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,740
-Sanjana.
-Karan was right.

875
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,820
Sanjana!

876
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,060
Sanjana, stop.

877
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,820
Sanjana!

878
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:44,980
Why are you so angry?

879
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,220
What did Karan say?

880
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,180
He said you are not Saravanan.

881
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,780
Do you believe that?

882
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,700
I do! Saravanan wouldn't have
stood so far away from me.

883
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,420
Now?

884
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,060
He would have hugged me
before he started talking.

885
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,340
For 15 years,
I yearned to see you again,

886
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,420
to talk to you...

887
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,140
I've cried, longing to be
hugged by you.

888
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,620
Tell me now.

889
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,580
Am I Saravanan, or not?

890
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:09,900
<span style="style.center_1">My heart sings a sweet lullaby!</span>

891
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,020
<span style="style.center_1">My modesty sleeps</span>

892
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:17,300
<span style="style.center_1">Like a gentle flower</span>

893
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,420
<span style="style.center_1">A strange sensation</span>

894
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,580
<span style="style.center_1">Fills my chest</span>

895
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:28,100
<span style="style.center_1">A great expectation</span>

896
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,140
<span style="style.center_1">Soars skyward</span>

897
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:37,100
<span style="style.center_1">Hey, you! What's that you're doing to me?</span>

898
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:42,900
<span style="style.center_1">Hey, you!</span>

899
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:47,940
<span style="style.center_1">You're serenading me</span>

900
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,420
<span style="style.center_1">Teasing me with your shadows</span>

901
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,940
<span style="style.center_1">You spread a lovely fragrance</span>

902
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,700
<span style="style.center_1">My dreams are finally</span>

903
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,420
<span style="style.center_1">Coming to life</span>

904
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:59,460
<span style="style.center_1">Though you went away</span>

905
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,460
<span style="style.center_1">Our love will</span>

906
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:06,620
<span style="style.center_1">Blossom forever</span>

907
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,980
<span style="style.center_1">Wrong words</span>

908
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:14,260
<span style="style.center_1">Have been uttered</span>

909
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:18,140
<span style="style.center_1">The silence</span>

910
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,500
<span style="style.center_1">Endured</span>

911
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:23,780
<span style="style.center_1">How I pined</span>
<span style="style.center_1">When you left with no goodbye!</span>

912
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,420
<span style="style.center_1">How I lived my life teary-eyed!</span>

913
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,700
<span style="style.center_1">Time has flown, it's been ages</span>

914
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,620
<span style="style.center_1">My soul was in a hot pursuit of yours</span>

915
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:39,860
<span style="style.center_1">You're the needle</span>
<span style="style.center_1">On the compass in my hand</span>

916
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,620
<span style="style.center_1">You're the eternal voice in my head</span>

917
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,340
I agree with you.

918
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,940
I had my doubts.

919
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,660
But a DNA test between them
resulted in a positive match.

920
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,500
Do you need any other evidence?

921
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:19,460
<span style="style.center_1">Coca Cola is brown in color</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The same as my lover</span>

922
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,340
What's up, Dad?

923
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,940
The usual teenage problems.

924
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,220
Knee pain is common
among college students!

925
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,260
The old lady is trying
to hide something.

926
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,460
What is it, Granny?
Are you cold?

927
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,180
What's that?

928
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,180
Show it to me.

929
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:47,780
<span style="style.center_1">This is not Saravanan.</span>

930
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,820
Is this what you were trying to write
all these days?

931
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,660
You think you're some big whistle-blower?

932
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,260
Do you want to expose the truth?

933
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,700
You must have struggled
to write this down

934
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,700
Look.

935
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,460
Keep scribbling stuff like
a school kid doing homework

936
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,620
and that wheelchair is
going to get lonely.

937
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,380
Get it?

938
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,700
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, how she looked at me...</span>

939
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:40,820
Greetings, sir.

940
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:42,220
How are you?

941
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,180
Why did you want
to meet me urgently?

942
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,580
I had come to Ooty.
Thought I'd stop by to see you.

943
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,180
Come on.

944
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,620
You're Saravanan now.

945
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,780
Sit up on the chair.

946
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,740
Old habits die hard!

947
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,140
Dad got it for me.

948
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,540
Looks like the old man
is pampering his son.

949
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,740
Yeah, right!

950
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,820
The food is so different here.

951
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:16,780
I don't drink!

952
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,740
Go ahead.

953
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:18,940
-No, thanks.
-Out of respect?

954
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,620
I've been calling you
for two weeks now.

955
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,340
Were you too busy
to answer my calls?

956
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,380
You know my situation!

957
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,660
I need to put up an act
in front of everyone.

958
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,260
They've started believing me.
Don't get impatient.

959
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:32,500
Impatient?

960
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,940
Putting on an act isn't new to you.

961
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,340
Sir, forget it.

962
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,180
You said you'd take my name off
all the case records.

963
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,060
The boys told me you haven't done it yet.

964
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,700
You only care about your work!

965
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,380
What about mine?

966
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,700
Everything is going well.

967
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,060
Everyone believes me.

968
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,580
If we go for it now, we can only
make about three to five million.

969
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,300
That's hardly anything these days.

970
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,020
Gnanamoorthy has only one daughter.

971
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,180
They will find a groom for her,
and get her married soon.

972
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,980
When she gets married,
I will inherit all his wealth.

973
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,700
Let's split that.

974
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,660
I can't trust you.

975
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,620
You're a fraud!

976
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,980
Why can't you arrange for
one of your guys as the groom?

977
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,500
It will get done faster,
and you will inherit all the wealth.

978
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,820
Why should I wait?

979
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,220
Sir, I need to go with Dad
to the party office.

980
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,380
Don't worry, sir.

981
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,620
Just be a little patient,
everything will work out fine.

982
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,820
See you.

983
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,220
Chief.

984
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,580
I don't want Plan B or Plan C.

985
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,420
The inspector at Mettupalayam
is curious.

986
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,540
I have your complete history here.

987
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,500
If I show this to him,
he'll go for the kill.

988
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,980
Let's eat, Dad.

989
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,140
I don't feel good.

990
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,900
Where are you going?

991
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:48,060
I'm calling Dad for dinner.

992
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,980
Dad is upset.
He said he isn't coming.

993
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,180
He will come if I call him.

994
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,820
I couldn't convince him.

995
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,140
How could you, with this tone?

996
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:55,660
Leave. I'll bring him.

997
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,220
-Dad, let's eat.
-I'm not hungry.

998
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:02,260
Come on, Dad.

999
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,060
When something is troubling you,
share it with someone.

1000
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,340
You will feel better.

1001
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,220
What's troubling you?
Tell me.

1002
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,420
It's nothing...

1003
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,060
A son can read his father's face.

1004
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:15,580
You're worried about something.

1005
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,300
I'm your son. Tell me.

1006
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,020
It's our people.

1007
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,420
They live in the hills.

1008
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,660
But their lives are down under.

1009
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,460
If the court verdict is not in our favor,

1010
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,060
and if they handout a pittance
in the name of compensation,

1011
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,220
like throwing scraps to a dog

1012
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,060
asking these people
to go and make a living elsewhere,

1013
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,140
they won't know how to survive.

1014
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,460
It will be like asking a fish
to live outside water.

1015
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,100
They are counting on me
to save them.

1016
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,100
If things were to go wrong...

1017
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,420
-I won't be able to live with the regret.
-Don't utter such words.

1018
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,700
We shouldn't allow them to
build the resort in our town

1019
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,140
and we must reclaim those lands
for the people, right?

1020
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,220
I'll take care of it.

1021
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,580
I've seen a lot of criminals in Goa.

1022
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,620
-Forget it, let's have dinner.
-No.

1023
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,580
Go ahead.

1024
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,020
Dad, I bragged to sister
that I'll get you to eat.

1025
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,340
She doesn't think much of me!

1026
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,820
If you don't come to eat now,
she might spit at my face!

1027
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,380
Let's go, Dad. Please!

1028
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:44,660
Okay, let's go!

1029
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,260
Didn't someone say that
Dad won't come to eat?

1030
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:54,660
Dad is ready.

1031
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,100
Is the food ready?

1032
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,060
Dad, why don't you get a tattoo like me?

1033
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,380
I'll whack you!

1034
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,940
Tattoos, at this age?

1035
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,580
They say it hurts a lot.

1036
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,780
If you have some liquor,
you'd hardly feel it.

1037
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,580
This boy spoils his father!

1038
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,020
Hey, boy. Come here.

1039
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,460
You've got no classes today.
Where are you going?

1040
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:25,860
To give this slate to Grandma.

1041
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,260
So, you are the weapons supplier!
Give it to me!

1042
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:29,980
What's in that bag?

1043
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,420
Give it to me.

1044
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:34,460
I told my teacher
that you're a fraud.

1045
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,620
She didn't believe me.

1046
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:37,580
What's this?

1047
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,940
Wild tamarind.

1048
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,300
My teacher loves it.

1049
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,540
It's a gift.

1050
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,020
Why are you gifting it to her?

1051
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,220
I'll tell you something
if you can keep it to yourself.

1052
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:46,940
Come here.

1053
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,820
Mom?

1054
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:07,180
<span style="style.center_1">Now happiness is within our reach</span>
<span style="style.center_1">A floral scent wafts in the breeze</span>

1055
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,660
<span style="style.center_1">We paint our love in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This colorful canvas!</span>

1056
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:13,980
<span style="style.center_1">To grace our lives</span>
<span style="style.center_1">A flying fish fell from the skies</span>

1057
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,980
<span style="style.center_1">We celebrate this glorious day!</span>

1058
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:22,020
<span style="style.center_1">No matter what sorrow may befall you</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I will stand by you, defend you</span>

1059
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,740
<span style="style.center_1">So you can flourish!</span>

1060
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:29,060
<span style="style.center_1">All I pray to the Gods every day</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Is for your laughter, and your joy</span>

1061
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,060
<span style="style.center_1">May you live a prosperous life!</span>

1062
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,740
<span style="style.center_1">It's the date of birth</span>

1063
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:37,820
<span style="style.center_1">The glorious day of your birth!</span>

1064
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,100
<span style="style.center_1">The skies drip honey</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The clouds dance in glee</span>

1065
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,380
<span style="style.center_1">It's the day you came to Earth</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The day of your birth!</span>

1066
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,540
What happened was--

1067
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,740
<span style="style.center_1">The life we live</span>

1068
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,700
<span style="style.center_1">Is a loan from God</span>

1069
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:45,500
<span style="style.center_1">To pay off those dues</span>
<span style="style.center_1">We put a smile on others' faces</span>

1070
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:49,260
<span style="style.center_1">Life shows us the way</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To true happiness</span>

1071
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:52,420
<span style="style.center_1">The rest is meaningless pretense</span>

1072
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:56,300
<span style="style.center_1">Joys and sorrows, your endless pursuits</span>

1073
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,580
<span style="style.center_1">Through it all, lean on my shoulder</span>

1074
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,460
<span style="style.center_1">It's the date of birth</span>

1075
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,620
<span style="style.center_1">The glorious day of your birth!</span>

1076
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:10,020
<span style="style.center_1">The skies drip honey</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The clouds dance in glee</span>

1077
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:15,700
<span style="style.center_1">It's the day you came to Earth</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The day of your birth!</span>

1078
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,460
Sir, why did you come here?

1079
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,860
Is it your sister's wedding?

1080
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,900
It's my sister's birthday.
Are you drunk?

1081
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,140
Can you smell it?

1082
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,420
-Just a small one--
-Welcome, inspector.

1083
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,140
-Hello, sir.
-I came to see you.

1084
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:49,060
Really?

1085
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,020
I'll take it from here.

1086
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,180
-Come with me.
-Sure.

1087
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,740
I've come on an auspicious day.
Music, dance, and celebrations!

1088
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,740
All of you look so happy.

1089
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,380
Oh, yes, we are very happy.

1090
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,380
So?

1091
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,580
Are you doing well?

1092
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,380
Not so well, sir.

1093
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,980
Being a policeman,
how could you say that?

1094
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,620
Being a policeman is the problem.

1095
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,860
If I were a criminal,
I'd have made loads of money.

1096
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,380
I don't understand.

1097
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,620
I have a financial problem.

1098
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,740
Can you help me?

1099
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,660
I paid you for all the expenses
you incurred.

1100
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:22,820
Well...

1101
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,380
You are a gentleman.
You did pay me well.

1102
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:29,580
You asked for a man
to pose as your son.

1103
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,020
I arranged for it immediately.

1104
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,540
But to turn Vicky into Saravanan

1105
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:40,900
I had to tamper with the DNA test results,
and it cost me a lot of money.

1106
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,900
The inspector at Mettupalayam, Karan

1107
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,620
asked for a lot of proof.

1108
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,140
I had to arrange for
the original documents.

1109
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:48,940
It was a little expensive.

1110
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,820
I trust you won't come
back for more money.

1111
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,580
If you act petty again...

1112
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,100
You better not.

1113
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,500
I've been meaning to ask you.

1114
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,380
What will you do
if your missing son comes back?

1115
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,580
He would have come home
if he wanted to.

1116
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,060
He is not going to come back
after 15 years.

1117
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,140
How did you pull this off?
He trusts you completely.

1118
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,300
Remember what I said?
I'll see you.

1119
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,620
Oh, no.

1120
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,580
I'll come to see you.

1121
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,540
Get going.

1122
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,100
What's this place, right
in the middle of the forest?

1123
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:53,660
This is the village.

1124
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,500
That's the disputed property.

1125
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,340
Hello, ma'am.
How is your father?

1126
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:01,020
-He is doing well.
-I heard he fell sick.

1127
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,900
-He is better now.
-Tell him I asked about him.

1128
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:03,780
I will.

1129
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,420
-I'm her brother.
-I know, sir.

1130
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,420
Gunamathy!

1131
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,060
Hello!

1132
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,060
Do you know them by name?

1133
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,380
I've been with them for 14 years.

1134
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,900
I stayed indoors for a year
after you left.

1135
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,820
Dad brought me here.

1136
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,020
When I saw their problems

1137
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,100
I felt like mine were nothing
in comparison.

1138
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,300
-How are you?
-I'm good.

1139
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,580
Why don't you come here anymore?

1140
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:29,340
Work has kept me busy.

1141
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:31,620
-Where is that brat?
-He was right here.

1142
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,700
Come here, boy.

1143
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:40,380
So, is this your town?

1144
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,300
Yeah, man.

1145
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,740
He never respects anyone.

1146
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,300
He roams around the forest,
and doesn't return until dawn!

1147
01:14:46,258 --> 01:14:47,938
I'm at peace
only when he attends school.

1148
01:14:48,058 --> 01:14:50,538
You are the only person he listens to.

1149
01:14:51,178 --> 01:14:52,058
Come with me.

1150
01:14:52,778 --> 01:14:54,698
You can leave,
and send the car at 5:00 p.m.

1151
01:14:54,778 --> 01:14:55,938
No, I'll come to get you.

1152
01:14:56,618 --> 01:14:58,418
Does your husband still drink?

1153
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:01,218
He hasn't touched that wretched thing
since you spoke to him.

1154
01:16:36,298 --> 01:16:37,778
Did you notice the
truck's license number?

1155
01:16:37,858 --> 01:16:38,698
No, I didn't.

1156
01:16:38,778 --> 01:16:40,538
Something written on the lorry?

1157
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:43,578
I didn't have the time to do so.

1158
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,218
Were you really hit by a lorry?

1159
01:16:47,498 --> 01:16:49,658
Or are you trying to play
the sympathy card on me?

1160
01:16:50,018 --> 01:16:51,218
Why do you say such things, Bonda?

1161
01:16:51,298 --> 01:16:52,978
Call me Bonda again,
and I'll thrash you!

1162
01:16:55,138 --> 01:16:56,538
Let me tell you what happened.

1163
01:17:00,418 --> 01:17:01,978
You ran your vehicle into something

1164
01:17:02,578 --> 01:17:05,058
and now you're telling me that
someone tried to kill you.

1165
01:17:05,178 --> 01:17:07,698
You thought that would
change my mind about you

1166
01:17:07,938 --> 01:17:11,498
and I'd get worried
about my friend's safety.

1167
01:17:13,138 --> 01:17:16,538
I know why
you came to this place.

1168
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:18,858
You are running out of time.

1169
01:17:20,938 --> 01:17:21,778
You'll get caught.

1170
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:25,298
Get out.

1171
01:17:36,538 --> 01:17:38,978
They are capable of bumping off anyone
to get their work done.

1172
01:17:39,178 --> 01:17:41,418
We should be one step
ahead of them.

1173
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:42,738
-Saravanan?
-One moment.

1174
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:43,978
Are you okay?

1175
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:45,298
-I got scared.
-I'm okay, Mom.

1176
01:17:45,498 --> 01:17:46,418
Just a minor injury.

1177
01:17:49,658 --> 01:17:51,498
The resort builders are getting bold.

1178
01:17:51,578 --> 01:17:52,418
Saravanan?

1179
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:54,698
All these days,
he troubled our townspeople,

1180
01:17:55,298 --> 01:17:56,698
now he is targeting
our family.

1181
01:17:56,778 --> 01:17:58,578
-Forget him, he can't do much.
-No, Saravanan!

1182
01:17:58,818 --> 01:18:01,018
He has harmed Gnanamoorthy's son.
If we spare him

1183
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:02,618
the people will lose trust in us.

1184
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:04,218
Listen.

1185
01:18:04,978 --> 01:18:05,938
Do as you wish.

1186
01:18:06,138 --> 01:18:07,098
-Kill him--
-Dad!

1187
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,258
Did you just say that?

1188
01:18:10,138 --> 01:18:12,058
Don't get Saravanan
involved in your politics.

1189
01:18:12,178 --> 01:18:13,818
These things happen in politics.

1190
01:18:14,018 --> 01:18:15,818
Sister, I'm sure Dad's seen worse.

1191
01:18:15,898 --> 01:18:17,298
We can't be scared of him.

1192
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:18,818
I said no!

1193
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:21,738
We are doing it all
for our family's welfare.

1194
01:18:21,818 --> 01:18:23,378
-Dad, you don't--
-Don't get worked up.

1195
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:24,898
Shut up!
You won't get it.

1196
01:18:26,138 --> 01:18:26,938
Dad.

1197
01:18:27,298 --> 01:18:30,018
Don't talk to Saravanan
about politics ever again.

1198
01:18:30,378 --> 01:18:33,578
His life shouldn't be in danger
because of you or your politics.

1199
01:18:36,338 --> 01:18:37,178
Go in.

1200
01:18:38,818 --> 01:18:39,858
I said, go in!

1201
01:19:03,858 --> 01:19:04,738
Hello.

1202
01:19:04,818 --> 01:19:05,658
I'm Manimaran.

1203
01:19:05,938 --> 01:19:07,018
I need to talk to you.

1204
01:19:14,258 --> 01:19:16,178
<span style="style.center_1">You told me I can never see you again.</span>

1205
01:19:16,578 --> 01:19:18,498
<span style="style.center_1">But I have decided to meet you now.</span>

1206
01:19:18,978 --> 01:19:19,898
Where?

1207
01:19:27,658 --> 01:19:29,458
How did you get here?
I don't see your car.

1208
01:19:32,378 --> 01:19:33,458
Yes, I know.

1209
01:19:33,618 --> 01:19:35,298
You always take short-cuts.

1210
01:19:35,778 --> 01:19:37,218
-Want a drink?
-What do you want?

1211
01:19:39,378 --> 01:19:40,578
Straight to the point.

1212
01:19:43,898 --> 01:19:48,098
Your daughter couldn't get over her
lost brother, and refused to get married.

1213
01:19:48,298 --> 01:19:50,138
So, you asked for someone
to pose as your son.

1214
01:19:50,538 --> 01:19:51,778
I arranged for it.

1215
01:19:52,218 --> 01:19:54,538
You said that after her wedding
we'll tell everyone that

1216
01:19:54,778 --> 01:19:57,418
the son stole the money and jewels
and fled.

1217
01:19:57,538 --> 01:19:58,618
I trusted your word.

1218
01:19:59,018 --> 01:20:02,258
I met the opposition leader, Manimaran,
a couple of days ago.

1219
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:04,218
Nothing to worry about!

1220
01:20:04,418 --> 01:20:05,578
I didn't tell him anything.

1221
01:20:07,058 --> 01:20:09,058
But he explained a lot of things to me.

1222
01:20:09,658 --> 01:20:11,298
That's when I realized

1223
01:20:11,378 --> 01:20:13,658
this wasn't just about
your daughter's wedding.

1224
01:20:14,138 --> 01:20:17,898
Fifteen years ago, people sympathized
with a father who had lost his son

1225
01:20:17,978 --> 01:20:20,218
and voted you to victory.

1226
01:20:20,698 --> 01:20:22,898
You used that sympathy over
and over again...

1227
01:20:24,098 --> 01:20:25,578
and won a hat trick
of elections.

1228
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:26,618
But now...

1229
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:28,898
the people have become discontent,

1230
01:20:28,978 --> 01:20:32,058
wondering how a man, who couldn't
save his son will save them.

1231
01:20:33,178 --> 01:20:35,178
This has spoiled your image

1232
01:20:35,258 --> 01:20:37,578
and you started to fear that you
might lose the elections this time.

1233
01:20:39,178 --> 01:20:41,058
So, you came up with a master plan.

1234
01:20:47,338 --> 01:20:48,978
If your lost son
comes back home

1235
01:20:49,058 --> 01:20:52,178
you will have a political heir,
and the people will happily vote for you.

1236
01:20:52,298 --> 01:20:54,818
You can win the elections,
and get your daughter married.

1237
01:20:54,898 --> 01:20:56,498
That's quite a good plan.

1238
01:20:56,938 --> 01:20:58,938
-I've done so much for you.
-How much do you want?

1239
01:21:00,898 --> 01:21:02,658
Whenever I need money
I have to come to you.

1240
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:09,258
I know it's quite less,
but we are friends, after all!

1241
01:21:11,898 --> 01:21:12,698
Really?

1242
01:21:19,578 --> 01:21:20,458
Crores?

1243
01:21:23,058 --> 01:21:24,378
I can pay you two lakhs.

1244
01:21:25,738 --> 01:21:26,778
Take it and disappear.

1245
01:21:27,978 --> 01:21:29,058
Is this your final decision?

1246
01:21:30,538 --> 01:21:32,018
Fine, you can leave.

1247
01:21:32,738 --> 01:21:34,178
I've asked Manimaran to come here.

1248
01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:36,178
If we agree upon something,

1249
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:38,138
I'd just have to say "goodbye" to him.

1250
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,418
We have something to discuss now.

1251
01:21:42,058 --> 01:21:43,698
No one is going to believe
anything you say.

1252
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,058
The people really trust me.

1253
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:54,098
Vicky's original documents, and

1254
01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:55,978
our telephone conversations...

1255
01:21:56,338 --> 01:21:57,498
I've got all the records.

1256
01:22:02,498 --> 01:22:04,778
Manimaran is here.
You can leave.

1257
01:22:07,258 --> 01:22:08,938
I know how politicians are.

1258
01:22:09,338 --> 01:22:11,378
I'm not a fool
to come empty-handed.

1259
01:23:03,858 --> 01:23:04,738
Jeevanand?

1260
01:23:22,818 --> 01:23:23,698
Jeevanand?

1261
01:24:25,298 --> 01:24:26,498
Did any car pass by this road?

1262
01:24:26,578 --> 01:24:27,778
No, sir.

1263
01:24:27,898 --> 01:24:30,058
This is a reserved forest area.
No one can go in there.

1264
01:24:31,218 --> 01:24:32,178
Open the trunk.

1265
01:24:32,298 --> 01:24:33,618
You know who I am!

1266
01:24:33,898 --> 01:24:34,938
There are CCTV cameras.

1267
01:24:35,018 --> 01:24:36,218
We need to check everyone.

1268
01:24:36,298 --> 01:24:37,818
-Please cooperate with us.
-All right!

1269
01:24:47,378 --> 01:24:48,938
Sir, what is this?

1270
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:50,338
What's the issue?

1271
01:24:53,138 --> 01:24:53,938
What is this?

1272
01:24:54,018 --> 01:24:55,178
I have no idea.

1273
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:56,058
Who is he?

1274
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:57,498
I swear, I don't know.

1275
01:24:57,578 --> 01:24:59,218
I have no clue how
he got into this car.

1276
01:24:59,378 --> 01:25:01,058
-I'm speaking the truth.
-Call the station.

1277
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,498
What are you saying?

1278
01:25:05,978 --> 01:25:06,978
I can't believe it.

1279
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,458
I spoke to him this morning.

1280
01:25:10,698 --> 01:25:12,058
He said he is going back to Goa

1281
01:25:12,178 --> 01:25:14,058
and invited our family
to visit him sometime soon.

1282
01:25:14,138 --> 01:25:15,778
Uncle, when did you last
see him?

1283
01:25:15,858 --> 01:25:16,738
Just...

1284
01:25:17,018 --> 01:25:19,098
I mean, just a while ago.
On Parvathy's birthday.

1285
01:25:19,618 --> 01:25:21,058
How is he related to Manimaran?

1286
01:25:21,458 --> 01:25:23,458
-Why should Manimaran kill him?
-I don't know.

1287
01:25:23,658 --> 01:25:25,178
Someone else could have killed him.

1288
01:25:25,258 --> 01:25:27,578
Well, Manimaran is a weird guy

1289
01:25:27,978 --> 01:25:30,458
but I don't think he is capable of murder.

1290
01:25:31,858 --> 01:25:34,018
When was the last time you saw him?

1291
01:25:35,898 --> 01:25:38,098
Same as Dad.
On my sister's birthday.

1292
01:25:38,178 --> 01:25:40,858
So, he never contacted you
after he came back to town?

1293
01:25:41,378 --> 01:25:42,298
He did.

1294
01:25:42,978 --> 01:25:44,818
He called me two days ago
over some issue in Goa.

1295
01:25:44,898 --> 01:25:46,338
-Today?
-No.

1296
01:25:46,538 --> 01:25:49,818
Do you know about his activities
or where he stayed when he was in town?

1297
01:25:54,778 --> 01:25:55,578
Yes, Kathir?

1298
01:25:55,658 --> 01:25:57,698
Manimaran just admitted
that he knew Jeevanand.

1299
01:25:58,498 --> 01:26:00,858
He went and visited him this morning
at his place of stay.

1300
01:26:00,938 --> 01:26:01,738
Where?

1301
01:26:01,858 --> 01:26:03,338
<span style="style.center_1">-Pristine Valley.</span>
-Pristine Valley?

1302
01:26:05,178 --> 01:26:07,578
<span style="style.center_1">The inspector at Mettupalayam</span>
<span style="style.center_1">is curious.</span>

1303
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:09,418
I have your complete history here.

1304
01:26:09,578 --> 01:26:12,018
If I show this to him,
he'll go for the kill.

1305
01:26:13,018 --> 01:26:13,978
I'll be there.

1306
01:26:14,858 --> 01:26:17,258
Uncle, we know where Jeevanand lived.
I'm going there.

1307
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:18,978
-I'll see you.
-Okay.

1308
01:26:20,338 --> 01:26:21,498
He was a good man.

1309
01:26:21,618 --> 01:26:24,018
Anything can happen to anyone
these days.

1310
01:26:24,098 --> 01:26:25,698
Life is very unpredictable.

1311
01:26:54,818 --> 01:26:56,898
-How do I get to Pristine Valley?
-Go that way.

1312
01:28:00,698 --> 01:28:01,578
Hi, dude.

1313
01:28:01,778 --> 01:28:02,818
Why did you come here?

1314
01:28:03,258 --> 01:28:05,418
You said you didn't know
where Jeevanand lived.

1315
01:28:06,778 --> 01:28:09,418
You mentioned Pristine Valley
on the phone.

1316
01:28:09,498 --> 01:28:10,338
Yes.

1317
01:28:10,738 --> 01:28:11,858
What's your business here?

1318
01:28:12,578 --> 01:28:14,298
I knew Jeevanand for several years.

1319
01:28:15,218 --> 01:28:16,578
He has done a lot for me.

1320
01:28:17,818 --> 01:28:19,498
It was him who brought me
back home.

1321
01:28:19,738 --> 01:28:21,658
I know him much better than you.

1322
01:28:21,778 --> 01:28:23,778
I thought my presence
would be helpful.

1323
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:24,938
Is that all?

1324
01:28:25,978 --> 01:28:27,618
Or, did you come here to
get something you forgot?

1325
01:28:29,418 --> 01:28:31,298
Are you trying to pin this murder on me?

1326
01:28:31,898 --> 01:28:34,018
I was at home all day.
You can check with Mom.

1327
01:28:34,218 --> 01:28:36,258
How did you know that
Jeevanand died today?

1328
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:38,858
You're a policeman.
This is basic.

1329
01:28:39,418 --> 01:28:40,498
Dad said

1330
01:28:40,658 --> 01:28:42,298
that Jeevanand called him
this morning.

1331
01:28:45,818 --> 01:28:47,778
If you don't like me being here,
I'll get going.

1332
01:28:48,138 --> 01:28:49,658
You went through a lot of trouble
to get here.

1333
01:28:49,978 --> 01:28:50,898
Let's go in.

1334
01:29:16,858 --> 01:29:18,018
Check thoroughly.

1335
01:29:18,098 --> 01:29:20,178
-Make sure you don't miss anything.
-Okay, sir.

1336
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:24,258
That's the job of policemen.

1337
01:29:24,818 --> 01:29:25,698
We'll take care of it.

1338
01:29:31,378 --> 01:29:33,378
Do you believe Manimaran killed him?

1339
01:29:34,218 --> 01:29:35,538
How would I know?

1340
01:29:35,898 --> 01:29:37,418
But I can see that
you don't believe it.

1341
01:29:38,658 --> 01:29:41,258
But I can't do much.
All the evidence we have, is against him.

1342
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,138
When I interrogated Manimaran

1343
01:29:45,018 --> 01:29:48,058
he said that Jeevanand asked him to come
here to discuss something important.

1344
01:29:48,618 --> 01:29:50,178
But when he got here,
the place was empty.

1345
01:29:50,258 --> 01:29:51,618
He just saw blood
on the floor.

1346
01:29:52,018 --> 01:29:54,578
He saw a Grey car on the road outside.

1347
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:57,178
But the car number and model...

1348
01:29:58,178 --> 01:29:59,618
He said he missed it.

1349
01:30:00,298 --> 01:30:03,018
So, someone was here
before he came.

1350
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:05,138
Well...

1351
01:30:06,338 --> 01:30:08,418
you have a Grey car at home, don't you?

1352
01:30:09,218 --> 01:30:11,058
Yeah, I committed this murder.

1353
01:30:11,138 --> 01:30:12,778
You really believe his story?

1354
01:30:12,938 --> 01:30:15,178
Then why did he tell the police
he didn't know Jeevanand?

1355
01:30:15,258 --> 01:30:17,298
People react differently
when they are scared.

1356
01:30:18,018 --> 01:30:21,138
Maybe he said that out of fear
when he saw the dead body.

1357
01:30:23,178 --> 01:30:24,018
Yes?

1358
01:30:40,618 --> 01:30:41,418
What is it?

1359
01:30:59,138 --> 01:31:00,658
Where are the gloves?

1360
01:31:01,098 --> 01:31:02,818
-It's in the car.
-Go, get it.

1361
01:32:09,978 --> 01:32:11,538
<span style="style.center_1">Where is that file?</span>

1362
01:32:47,018 --> 01:32:47,858
Sir?

1363
01:32:48,498 --> 01:32:49,298
Sir!

1364
01:32:50,978 --> 01:32:52,978
-What is it, Singaram?
-Is your father home?

1365
01:32:53,058 --> 01:32:54,418
We tried calling him.

1366
01:32:54,498 --> 01:32:55,778
Mom and Dad
are on their way to Madurai.

1367
01:32:55,858 --> 01:32:57,138
They must be in the flight.

1368
01:32:57,218 --> 01:32:59,138
-What's the problem?
-Ma'am, it is...

1369
01:32:59,338 --> 01:33:00,698
What happened? Tell me.

1370
01:33:05,698 --> 01:33:07,338
Oh, no!

1371
01:33:34,898 --> 01:33:37,778
My only son has been killed.

1372
01:33:39,138 --> 01:33:42,338
-Look at my son.
-What a tragic sight.

1373
01:33:43,578 --> 01:33:45,178
My little one.

1374
01:33:47,658 --> 01:33:50,578
Look, your teacher is here.

1375
01:33:58,498 --> 01:33:59,978
It's them!

1376
01:34:00,058 --> 01:34:01,938
We shouldn't spare them.
Come on!

1377
01:34:07,138 --> 01:34:08,618
Block the car.

1378
01:34:08,818 --> 01:34:09,978
Don't spare them.

1379
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:21,258
Don't shout.

1380
01:34:21,378 --> 01:34:23,618
Calm down, everybody.
Calm down.

1381
01:34:23,818 --> 01:34:25,818
-You killed our boy.
-What happened?

1382
01:34:25,938 --> 01:34:29,858
Your electric fence has resulted
in the death of a little boy.

1383
01:34:30,058 --> 01:34:31,658
Don't talk nonsense.

1384
01:34:32,058 --> 01:34:33,738
This fencing has very low voltage.

1385
01:34:33,818 --> 01:34:36,338
The current is not powerful enough
to kill a human or any animal.

1386
01:34:36,978 --> 01:34:39,018
The electricity hit him
when he touched the fence

1387
01:34:39,098 --> 01:34:40,938
and the little boy
died right before my eyes.

1388
01:34:41,418 --> 01:34:44,218
For how long are you going to
continue cheating these people?

1389
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:45,578
Don't accuse us.

1390
01:34:45,658 --> 01:34:46,898
We are not lying.

1391
01:34:47,018 --> 01:34:48,978
-Tell them, sir.
-You can try touching it.

1392
01:34:49,098 --> 01:34:50,178
Or one of my men can do so.

1393
01:34:50,258 --> 01:34:52,218
I know the disgusting things
you are capable of,

1394
01:34:52,338 --> 01:34:54,138
to chase these people
away from their homes.

1395
01:34:54,218 --> 01:34:56,178
What's wrong with me fencing my property?

1396
01:34:56,538 --> 01:35:00,138
Just because you bribed some people ten
years ago, this becomes your property now?

1397
01:35:00,938 --> 01:35:03,658
When the court order is out,
you will see that this is my property.

1398
01:35:04,018 --> 01:35:04,978
Wait for it.

1399
01:35:05,058 --> 01:35:06,578
Go to any court you like.

1400
01:35:06,818 --> 01:35:08,618
You can't get these people
to vacate this place.

1401
01:35:08,698 --> 01:35:09,818
They shall remain here.

1402
01:35:10,178 --> 01:35:12,658
Don't try to instigate these people.

1403
01:35:12,978 --> 01:35:14,218
Otherwise, things will get ugly.

1404
01:35:14,298 --> 01:35:15,378
What will get ugly?

1405
01:35:15,538 --> 01:35:16,858
What will you do?

1406
01:35:27,578 --> 01:35:28,938
Don't you dare touch my sister!

1407
01:35:36,978 --> 01:35:38,778
Saravanan!

1408
01:35:50,018 --> 01:35:50,978
Sister, get out of here.

1409
01:35:51,058 --> 01:35:52,178
Ma'am, let's leave.

1410
01:35:52,258 --> 01:35:53,538
Let's go, ma'am.

1411
01:35:54,018 --> 01:35:55,498
Your family is causing trouble.

1412
01:35:56,738 --> 01:35:57,698
Chase them away.

1413
01:36:50,058 --> 01:36:50,938
Saravanan!

1414
01:37:14,898 --> 01:37:16,498
Why are you just watching?

1415
01:37:16,578 --> 01:37:17,938
Let's chase them out.

1416
01:37:18,018 --> 01:37:20,618
-Sir, let's get out of here.
-Don't spare them.

1417
01:37:20,698 --> 01:37:22,498
Hit him!

1418
01:37:22,578 --> 01:37:23,778
Chase them out.

1419
01:37:54,498 --> 01:37:55,378
Who is it?

1420
01:37:57,498 --> 01:37:58,418
Were you sleeping?

1421
01:37:58,658 --> 01:37:59,458
Come in, sister.

1422
01:38:16,218 --> 01:38:17,098
What is it?

1423
01:38:20,738 --> 01:38:22,058
I can't get him out of my head.

1424
01:38:25,698 --> 01:38:27,778
I just met him,
and it's so hard on me.

1425
01:38:29,298 --> 01:38:31,098
I can only imagine how
hard it must be for you.

1426
01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:38,258
I had only one source of happiness
and solace in this place.

1427
01:38:40,058 --> 01:38:41,098
It was him.

1428
01:38:42,738 --> 01:38:43,898
He was always around me.

1429
01:38:45,058 --> 01:38:47,298
The things I liked,
the things I hated...

1430
01:38:49,498 --> 01:38:50,618
He knew everything.

1431
01:38:54,898 --> 01:38:55,978
Please don't cry.

1432
01:39:03,538 --> 01:39:05,778
Why did you beat them up so badly?

1433
01:39:08,898 --> 01:39:10,458
That man was about to hit you.

1434
01:39:11,658 --> 01:39:12,898
I got angry.

1435
01:39:14,298 --> 01:39:15,418
I couldn't control it.

1436
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:18,578
Anger.

1437
01:39:19,818 --> 01:39:21,298
You still have the same temper.

1438
01:39:22,578 --> 01:39:23,738
But when it comes
to everything else,

1439
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:25,738
you are a different person.

1440
01:39:28,218 --> 01:39:31,018
I've never seen this sort of affection
from the old Saravanan.

1441
01:39:32,178 --> 01:39:33,418
He never cared about anyone.

1442
01:39:33,898 --> 01:39:35,178
He was rude.

1443
01:39:35,978 --> 01:39:36,818
But now...

1444
01:39:37,578 --> 01:39:40,978
you work so hard to put a smile
on other people's faces.

1445
01:39:42,778 --> 01:39:44,058
You are very matured.

1446
01:39:47,178 --> 01:39:49,138
Did you have a tough life in Goa?

1447
01:39:58,178 --> 01:39:59,658
I knew no one there.

1448
01:40:00,778 --> 01:40:02,058
I lived as an orphan.

1449
01:40:03,178 --> 01:40:05,458
I don't know the difference
between happiness and sadness.

1450
01:40:07,898 --> 01:40:09,578
I'd feel hungry at night.

1451
01:40:10,618 --> 01:40:11,698
But I had no money.

1452
01:40:13,458 --> 01:40:15,178
I longed for my parents.

1453
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:18,938
Just knowing the fact that...

1454
01:40:20,058 --> 01:40:22,178
there are people at home
who care about you...

1455
01:40:23,938 --> 01:40:25,138
that is so important.

1456
01:40:26,738 --> 01:40:28,058
I can cope with hunger.

1457
01:40:29,378 --> 01:40:31,098
But coping with loneliness
is much harder.

1458
01:40:33,538 --> 01:40:35,338
I thought money would fix everything.

1459
01:40:36,578 --> 01:40:40,538
I would do anything for money,
I would cheat anybody.

1460
01:40:42,098 --> 01:40:43,778
I never worried about
right or wrong.

1461
01:40:46,058 --> 01:40:47,138
But what I witnessed here...

1462
01:40:48,178 --> 01:40:50,098
You are a bunch of good people.
I'm not good.

1463
01:40:53,058 --> 01:40:55,178
I am ashamed of myself.

1464
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:56,138
Don't be.

1465
01:40:56,698 --> 01:40:58,098
It was due to the circumstances.

1466
01:41:00,298 --> 01:41:02,418
Love changes everything.

1467
01:41:03,938 --> 01:41:05,098
It has changed you.

1468
01:41:06,578 --> 01:41:07,938
It has changed me.

1469
01:41:15,698 --> 01:41:17,498
A sacred thread from the Murugan temple.

1470
01:41:17,938 --> 01:41:18,938
Show me your hand.

1471
01:41:20,538 --> 01:41:23,298
I collected these for 15 years.

1472
01:41:27,538 --> 01:41:28,818
And now you're here...

1473
01:41:30,058 --> 01:41:31,298
to get it tied on your hand.

1474
01:41:34,858 --> 01:41:36,378
Okay.
Go to sleep.

1475
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:37,258
Okay, sister.

1476
01:41:55,978 --> 01:41:57,818
What? Are you feeling bad?

1477
01:41:59,738 --> 01:42:01,018
They trust me.

1478
01:42:01,578 --> 01:42:02,658
What are you going to do?

1479
01:42:14,738 --> 01:42:15,578
<span style="style.center_1">Sister.</span>

1480
01:42:16,138 --> 01:42:17,058
<span style="style.center_1">Please forgive me.</span>

1481
01:42:17,658 --> 01:42:18,898
<span style="style.center_1">I'm not your brother.</span>

1482
01:42:22,898 --> 01:42:25,378
<span style="style.center_1">I'm just a thief</span>
<span style="style.center_1">pretending to be Saravanan.</span>

1483
01:42:25,458 --> 01:42:28,378
<span style="style.center_1">I'm completely undeserving of the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">love you have showered over me.</span>

1484
01:42:28,618 --> 01:42:30,298
<span style="style.center_1">I can't continue pretending anymore.</span>

1485
01:42:30,578 --> 01:42:31,698
<span style="style.center_1">I am leaving this house.</span>

1486
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:32,658
<span style="style.center_1">Vicky.</span>

1487
01:43:16,138 --> 01:43:16,978
Grandma.

1488
01:43:18,378 --> 01:43:21,058
You wanted to tell everyone
that I am not your grandson.

1489
01:43:23,418 --> 01:43:26,018
Now, I wish to tell everyone, but...

1490
01:43:28,058 --> 01:43:29,458
I don't have the courage.

1491
01:43:31,778 --> 01:43:34,138
I don't know how to respect
and treat the elders.

1492
01:43:35,658 --> 01:43:37,338
Please forgive me
if I treated you badly.

1493
01:44:46,538 --> 01:44:47,858
That way!

1494
01:44:50,298 --> 01:44:51,618
Come on!

1495
01:45:26,098 --> 01:45:28,018
Go that way!

1496
01:45:28,218 --> 01:45:30,418
Come on! Go!

1497
01:45:46,578 --> 01:45:47,498
Saravanan.

1498
01:45:51,298 --> 01:45:53,018
-What is it, dear?
-Go in.

1499
01:45:53,178 --> 01:45:54,778
-Dad, get inside.
-Oh, no.

1500
01:45:58,218 --> 01:45:59,938
Stay inside.
Close the door.

1501
01:46:00,018 --> 01:46:01,658
What is happening, dear?

1502
01:46:05,698 --> 01:46:06,658
Hello, Karan?

1503
01:46:24,778 --> 01:46:25,738
Saravanan!

1504
01:46:25,818 --> 01:46:27,178
Sister, go inside.
Don't come here.

1505
01:46:27,338 --> 01:46:29,218
-Just go inside!
-What is happening?

1506
01:46:29,298 --> 01:46:32,018
-Who are these people?
-First, go inside!

1507
01:46:34,338 --> 01:46:35,618
Go inside!

1508
01:46:35,858 --> 01:46:37,258
Saravanan, wait.
Who are they?

1509
01:46:37,498 --> 01:46:39,138
Open the door! Saravanan!

1510
01:46:40,498 --> 01:46:41,538
Dad!

1511
01:46:44,418 --> 01:46:45,378
Saravanan!

1512
01:46:49,018 --> 01:46:51,498
Mom, Dad!
Where are you?

1513
01:46:53,258 --> 01:46:54,298
Open the door!

1514
01:46:54,778 --> 01:46:55,658
Saravanan!

1515
01:47:11,578 --> 01:47:13,138
What happened? Who were they?

1516
01:47:13,218 --> 01:47:14,938
-Three men went that way.
-Get them!

1517
01:47:15,018 --> 01:47:16,018
Saravanan!

1518
01:47:19,938 --> 01:47:20,978
Who were those men?

1519
01:47:21,058 --> 01:47:22,058
No idea.

1520
01:47:22,938 --> 01:47:24,138
Where is Saravanan?

1521
01:47:24,298 --> 01:47:25,418
Where is he?

1522
01:47:25,978 --> 01:47:27,298
Oh, no! Saravanan!

1523
01:47:27,538 --> 01:47:28,578
Mom, it's nothing.

1524
01:47:28,738 --> 01:47:30,098
-Who were they?
-Thieves, I think.

1525
01:47:30,178 --> 01:47:32,218
-Are you okay?
-Three men came here.

1526
01:47:32,858 --> 01:47:34,378
Nothing to worry.
Listen...

1527
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:36,698
Go to your rooms
and check if anything is missing.

1528
01:47:37,098 --> 01:47:39,658
-Karan is here, we will handle it.
-Go and check thoroughly, Mom.

1529
01:47:39,738 --> 01:47:41,378
-Okay.
-Go on. He is here now.

1530
01:47:41,458 --> 01:47:43,658
Uncle, just file a complaint.
I'll take it from there.

1531
01:47:47,498 --> 01:47:48,818
Who would dare to
break into this house?

1532
01:47:48,898 --> 01:47:50,298
How did they get in?

1533
01:47:50,378 --> 01:47:51,738
I suddenly heard some noise.

1534
01:47:51,818 --> 01:47:53,378
Must be someone from outside the town.

1535
01:47:54,298 --> 01:47:56,218
-This has never happened before.
-What happened, Uncle?

1536
01:48:42,458 --> 01:48:43,418
-Grandma!
-Grandma?

1537
01:48:43,498 --> 01:48:45,138
-Grandma, what happened?
-Mom!

1538
01:48:45,218 --> 01:48:46,578
-Grandma!
-Is she okay?

1539
01:48:46,658 --> 01:48:48,618
-Grandma!
-Lift her up.

1540
01:48:48,778 --> 01:48:49,978
Careful.

1541
01:48:50,058 --> 01:48:51,658
-Lift her up slowly.
-Grandma?

1542
01:48:53,738 --> 01:48:55,138
Careful.

1543
01:48:55,978 --> 01:48:57,578
Mom, be careful.

1544
01:48:57,658 --> 01:48:59,418
Come on.

1545
01:48:59,538 --> 01:49:00,818
Lift her up, Karan.

1546
01:49:01,458 --> 01:49:03,258
Get up slowly.

1547
01:49:03,378 --> 01:49:04,698
Gently.

1548
01:49:04,898 --> 01:49:06,058
Be gentle.

1549
01:49:06,258 --> 01:49:07,978
Don't strain her hip.

1550
01:49:08,098 --> 01:49:10,218
-Careful.
-Grandma!

1551
01:49:10,498 --> 01:49:11,538
You're okay?

1552
01:49:12,058 --> 01:49:13,938
Are you fine, Mom?

1553
01:49:14,578 --> 01:49:15,738
It's nothing.
Be brave.

1554
01:49:16,178 --> 01:49:17,058
Come on.

1555
01:49:19,418 --> 01:49:23,298
I'm sure they didn't come to steal.
They came to kill.

1556
01:49:23,898 --> 01:49:25,538
Manimaran is behind bars.

1557
01:49:25,618 --> 01:49:28,058
No, boss. Manimaran got out
on bail yesterday.

1558
01:49:28,338 --> 01:49:30,618
He is angry with you
for ending up in prison.

1559
01:49:30,938 --> 01:49:32,218
He is capable of anything.

1560
01:49:32,458 --> 01:49:35,298
If we let this pass,
he'd be a danger to everyone.

1561
01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:43,418
Manimaran?

1562
01:49:45,938 --> 01:49:46,818
Saravanan!

1563
01:49:47,698 --> 01:49:48,498
Welcome.

1564
01:49:49,618 --> 01:49:51,018
I need to speak to you in private.

1565
01:49:51,098 --> 01:49:52,298
-How are you?
-You heard me!

1566
01:49:55,578 --> 01:49:56,778
Take the child inside.

1567
01:50:01,018 --> 01:50:02,898
Why did you send men to kill my father?

1568
01:50:02,978 --> 01:50:03,898
Stop!

1569
01:50:04,778 --> 01:50:06,018
Don't come close.
Go away.

1570
01:50:07,778 --> 01:50:08,618
Go in, dear.

1571
01:50:10,338 --> 01:50:11,498
Take the child inside.

1572
01:50:17,378 --> 01:50:20,418
You still haven't lost the habit
of hitting people before talking to them.

1573
01:50:21,858 --> 01:50:22,778
Am I a murderer?

1574
01:50:24,658 --> 01:50:25,498
Fantastic!

1575
01:50:25,778 --> 01:50:26,618
Superb!

1576
01:50:27,298 --> 01:50:29,378
I tried to kill your family.

1577
01:50:30,338 --> 01:50:32,578
I killed the cop from Goa.

1578
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:35,858
The entire town
thought that I killed you.

1579
01:50:37,338 --> 01:50:38,858
You think I'd kill your family?

1580
01:50:40,378 --> 01:50:41,818
Saravanan, you think I'd kill you?

1581
01:50:42,938 --> 01:50:43,938
You believe it?

1582
01:50:44,578 --> 01:50:45,818
Do you believe that?

1583
01:50:46,458 --> 01:50:47,298
Go on, hit me.

1584
01:50:47,658 --> 01:50:48,578
Hit me!

1585
01:50:48,858 --> 01:50:49,698
I'll take it.

1586
01:50:49,898 --> 01:50:51,258
But tell me this.

1587
01:50:52,178 --> 01:50:53,378
Did I force you to drink?

1588
01:50:54,138 --> 01:50:55,538
Did I get you drugs?

1589
01:50:57,298 --> 01:51:01,378
Who stopped you when you
went behind those men for drugs?

1590
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:02,618
Me!

1591
01:51:02,778 --> 01:51:03,698
Your friend.

1592
01:51:04,578 --> 01:51:06,378
You'd get drunk
and pass out on the roads.

1593
01:51:07,618 --> 01:51:08,978
Who took you back home?

1594
01:51:09,978 --> 01:51:10,818
Me!

1595
01:51:11,218 --> 01:51:12,098
Your friend.

1596
01:51:12,738 --> 01:51:15,258
You came on your bike that night,
and asked me to come along.

1597
01:51:16,058 --> 01:51:18,218
<span style="style.center_1">I begged you several times</span>
<span style="style.center_1">not to do it.</span>

1598
01:51:19,938 --> 01:51:21,378
<span style="style.center_1">My only mistake was</span>

1599
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:22,618
<span style="style.center_1">hitting you that night.</span>

1600
01:51:23,818 --> 01:51:25,018
I left you in the lorry.

1601
01:51:25,098 --> 01:51:26,458
I got scared when I saw the cops.

1602
01:51:26,578 --> 01:51:27,898
That was my only mistake.

1603
01:51:28,538 --> 01:51:29,938
I didn't do anything else!

1604
01:51:30,538 --> 01:51:31,938
When I heard you came back

1605
01:51:32,138 --> 01:51:33,938
I rushed here with joy
to see you

1606
01:51:34,018 --> 01:51:35,018
and you hit me.

1607
01:51:35,458 --> 01:51:36,578
All these years,

1608
01:51:36,658 --> 01:51:38,658
do you know what they said about me?

1609
01:51:40,298 --> 01:51:41,218
Drunkard.

1610
01:51:41,378 --> 01:51:42,298
And now I am

1611
01:51:42,458 --> 01:51:43,298
a murderer.

1612
01:51:44,098 --> 01:51:45,338
You saw my son.

1613
01:51:46,138 --> 01:51:48,098
Do you know what the world
would call my son?

1614
01:51:48,658 --> 01:51:49,858
Son of a murderer.

1615
01:51:50,218 --> 01:51:51,338
I lost in politics.

1616
01:51:51,738 --> 01:51:52,738
I lost in life.

1617
01:51:52,978 --> 01:51:54,138
I lost everything.

1618
01:51:54,378 --> 01:51:55,178
But

1619
01:51:55,458 --> 01:51:56,618
I'm not losing as a friend.

1620
01:51:57,138 --> 01:51:58,178
Not as a friend.

1621
01:51:58,378 --> 01:51:59,378
I haven't.

1622
01:51:59,498 --> 01:52:02,498
To be fair, you don't
deserve my friendship!

1623
01:52:03,098 --> 01:52:04,498
-Manimaran, don't--
-Enough.

1624
01:52:20,018 --> 01:52:20,978
What?

1625
01:52:21,458 --> 01:52:22,618
Scared?

1626
01:52:25,058 --> 01:52:26,218
I'm not worried about myself.

1627
01:52:27,618 --> 01:52:29,578
But no harm must come to that family.

1628
01:52:30,618 --> 01:52:31,778
I must remain here.

1629
01:52:32,058 --> 01:52:33,138
Think about it.

1630
01:52:33,618 --> 01:52:36,178
Is it the family that's in danger,
or is it Saravanan?

1631
01:52:37,378 --> 01:52:39,738
Someone doesn't like Saravanan's return.

1632
01:52:40,498 --> 01:52:42,778
There is some connection between
Saravanan's disappearance 15 years ago

1633
01:52:42,858 --> 01:52:46,618
and the attempted murder on
Saravanan's life after he returned.

1634
01:52:47,058 --> 01:52:49,058
What really happened to Saravanan?

1635
01:52:54,138 --> 01:52:56,778
Mom, what happened on the day
I went missing?

1636
01:52:57,418 --> 01:52:58,738
Why do you ask now?

1637
01:52:58,898 --> 01:53:00,258
I don't remember anything, sister.

1638
01:53:00,418 --> 01:53:01,218
Tell me, Mom.

1639
01:53:02,858 --> 01:53:03,898
You were still young.

1640
01:53:04,138 --> 01:53:05,858
You never obeyed us.

1641
01:53:06,578 --> 01:53:07,738
It was your birthday.

1642
01:53:07,898 --> 01:53:10,138
<span style="style.center_1">You asked me for money</span>
<span style="style.center_1">to take your friends for a party.</span>

1643
01:53:10,218 --> 01:53:11,058
Let me go!

1644
01:53:11,178 --> 01:53:12,418
<span style="style.center_1">-I refused.</span>
-Give it to me!

1645
01:53:12,938 --> 01:53:14,658
<span style="style.center_1">-You broke the cupboard.</span>
-Stop it!

1646
01:53:14,938 --> 01:53:17,938
<span style="style.center_1">-And left with all the valuables.</span>
-Get out of my way!

1647
01:53:18,578 --> 01:53:19,378
Let go, Mom.

1648
01:53:19,618 --> 01:53:22,138
Saravanan,
don't get into these bad habits.

1649
01:53:22,218 --> 01:53:23,818
Your father would be very upset.

1650
01:53:23,898 --> 01:53:25,338
Get out of my way!

1651
01:53:26,098 --> 01:53:27,138
Grandma!
Grandma!

1652
01:53:27,458 --> 01:53:29,018
Grandma!

1653
01:53:29,698 --> 01:53:31,738
<span style="style.center_1">She fell down and got injured that day.</span>

1654
01:53:32,338 --> 01:53:36,098
<span style="style.center_1">Yes, son. You fought with your parents</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and left with Manimaran.</span>

1655
01:53:36,458 --> 01:53:37,578
Was Manimaran here?

1656
01:53:37,658 --> 01:53:38,538
Not at that time.

1657
01:53:38,938 --> 01:53:39,978
Then how did you know?

1658
01:53:40,058 --> 01:53:43,178
Duraipandi told us he saw
Manimaran and you on a bike.

1659
01:53:46,338 --> 01:53:47,898
Why do you ask about it?

1660
01:53:48,258 --> 01:53:49,178
No reason.

1661
01:53:49,978 --> 01:53:53,498
-Where can I find Duraipandi?
-I saw you on Gudalur Road.

1662
01:53:53,698 --> 01:53:55,338
Manimaran was on the bike with you.

1663
01:53:55,858 --> 01:53:58,258
Were we going to Gudalur,
or coming back from there?

1664
01:53:59,258 --> 01:54:01,138
I was transporting a load
back from Gudalur.

1665
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:03,698
You were on your way to Gudalur.

1666
01:54:05,698 --> 01:54:08,138
The elections were around the corner.
I was very busy.

1667
01:54:08,618 --> 01:54:10,378
I only heard about it through Sanjana.

1668
01:54:10,738 --> 01:54:14,058
She had gone to your house
to see you on your birthday.

1669
01:54:14,298 --> 01:54:15,858
Yes, it was your birthday.

1670
01:54:16,698 --> 01:54:20,018
I had bought a gift,
and wanted to wish you at midnight.

1671
01:54:20,418 --> 01:54:21,538
But you never came.

1672
01:54:21,618 --> 01:54:24,418
I came back the next morning
to fight with you.

1673
01:54:25,138 --> 01:54:26,258
But you weren't there.

1674
01:54:26,738 --> 01:54:28,298
I only saw Uncle and Pazhani.

1675
01:54:29,338 --> 01:54:30,738
Hasn't Saravanan returned yet?

1676
01:54:31,098 --> 01:54:32,378
He hasn't come since last night.

1677
01:54:32,578 --> 01:54:34,938
Parvathy and Padma are
in the hospital with my mother.

1678
01:54:35,018 --> 01:54:36,138
What happened to Grandma?

1679
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:38,018
She was careless.
She fell down.

1680
01:54:38,178 --> 01:54:39,578
I'm going to look for Saravanan.

1681
01:54:42,218 --> 01:54:44,778
<span style="style.center_1">Uncle was really stressed,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and left in a car to look for you.</span>

1682
01:54:45,778 --> 01:54:46,818
<span style="style.center_1">-Uncle.</span>
-Yes?

1683
01:54:47,098 --> 01:54:48,458
On the day I went missing

1684
01:54:48,618 --> 01:54:50,618
I heard that Dad was driving
all over town, searching for me.

1685
01:54:50,698 --> 01:54:52,578
-Yes.
-You didn't go with him?

1686
01:54:52,658 --> 01:54:54,418
That was the same day
Grandma got injured.

1687
01:54:54,498 --> 01:54:55,858
Your father sent me
to the hospital.

1688
01:54:56,418 --> 01:54:58,298
Boss, I'll drive the car.

1689
01:54:58,378 --> 01:55:01,138
Parvathy and Padma are
in the hospital with my mother.

1690
01:55:01,218 --> 01:55:03,018
-Okay.
-Go and help them. I'll handle this.

1691
01:55:03,098 --> 01:55:03,978
Okay, boss.

1692
01:55:06,018 --> 01:55:08,458
Your father was searching for you
all by himself.

1693
01:55:09,698 --> 01:55:11,098
-You were at the hospital.
-Yes.

1694
01:55:11,178 --> 01:55:12,898
How do you know that
he was searching for me?

1695
01:55:12,978 --> 01:55:14,098
I returned home at night.

1696
01:55:14,378 --> 01:55:17,058
<span style="style.center_1">It must have been around midnight.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I stepped out to use the toilet.</span>

1697
01:55:17,138 --> 01:55:19,538
<span style="style.center_1">I saw your father drive this way,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">still searching for you.</span>

1698
01:55:31,578 --> 01:55:35,658
<span style="style.center_1">Why should someone try to kill Saravanan</span>
<span style="style.center_1">who has returned 15 years later?</span>

1699
01:55:36,298 --> 01:55:38,618
<span style="style.center_1">Who would benefit from his death?</span>

1700
01:55:43,338 --> 01:55:46,658
Sir, can I see the CCTV footage
from the 25th of last month?

1701
01:55:46,858 --> 01:55:48,578
The date is right,
go forward.

1702
01:55:49,578 --> 01:55:51,538
Sir, stop.
Come back a little.

1703
01:55:54,618 --> 01:55:55,618
Zoom in.

1704
01:56:16,618 --> 01:56:17,458
Yes, sir?

1705
01:56:18,658 --> 01:56:21,138
Kumaraswamy told me that
the truck is being serviced.

1706
01:56:21,218 --> 01:56:22,578
Do you want to buy it?

1707
01:56:24,698 --> 01:56:25,538
Where is the driver?

1708
01:56:25,618 --> 01:56:26,778
He must be here.

1709
01:56:27,538 --> 01:56:28,458
Arivu!

1710
01:56:28,818 --> 01:56:29,618
Yes, brother?

1711
01:56:29,698 --> 01:56:31,378
Someone's here to check your lorry out.

1712
01:56:32,418 --> 01:56:33,218
Hold this.

1713
01:56:33,418 --> 01:56:35,018
Sir, are you here to--

1714
01:56:42,618 --> 01:56:43,498
Stop.

1715
01:56:43,698 --> 01:56:44,658
Stop!

1716
01:57:18,858 --> 01:57:20,378
Brother, that's the guy.

1717
01:57:22,618 --> 01:57:24,338
Oh, the one who caused the accident?

1718
01:57:32,938 --> 01:57:34,458
Let's get him today.

1719
01:58:20,618 --> 01:58:23,058
Tell me the truth.
Who asked you to kill me?

1720
01:59:08,618 --> 01:59:09,978
Out with it.
Who hired you?

1721
01:59:10,378 --> 01:59:11,178
Tell me.

1722
01:59:11,258 --> 01:59:12,378
-Tell me.
-Don't hit me.

1723
01:59:12,458 --> 01:59:13,498
I'll tell you.

1724
01:59:13,658 --> 01:59:14,578
I'll tell you.

1725
01:59:30,178 --> 01:59:31,978
Saravanan, what happened?

1726
01:59:33,138 --> 01:59:35,738
I told you I'd find out
who the troublemaker is.

1727
01:59:36,098 --> 01:59:36,978
It's him.

1728
01:59:37,058 --> 01:59:38,978
-What rubbish!
-Karan, you know nothing.

1729
01:59:39,138 --> 01:59:41,058
-Saravanan, what's happening?
-Get in, Sanjana.

1730
01:59:41,578 --> 01:59:42,938
Did I try to kill you?

1731
01:59:43,178 --> 01:59:45,218
You tried to kill your entire family
for money!

1732
01:59:45,298 --> 01:59:47,298
Shut up!
First, you tried to kill me.

1733
01:59:47,378 --> 01:59:49,178
And now you want to kill my father
and pin it on me.

1734
01:59:49,258 --> 01:59:50,058
-What?
-Karan!

1735
01:59:50,178 --> 01:59:51,498
What is this nonsense?

1736
01:59:51,578 --> 01:59:54,378
You're calling me a murderer
to cover up the fact that you're a fraud!

1737
01:59:55,858 --> 01:59:57,338
You remember the lorry driver, Arivu?

1738
01:59:57,418 --> 01:59:58,578
Who is Arivu?

1739
01:59:58,658 --> 01:59:59,818
-What about Marimuthu?
-Karan!

1740
01:59:59,898 --> 02:00:02,418
-He is a fraud. Take him away.
-Stop it!

1741
02:00:24,858 --> 02:00:25,938
He is the lorry driver.

1742
02:00:26,018 --> 02:00:27,258
He broke into our home
that night.

1743
02:00:27,338 --> 02:00:29,178
Uncle, do you know these men?

1744
02:00:29,578 --> 02:00:30,418
I don't.

1745
02:00:31,138 --> 02:00:31,938
Tell them.

1746
02:00:33,138 --> 02:00:35,898
Sir, he beat us up
and made us say that

1747
02:00:35,978 --> 02:00:38,378
this man hired us to kill him.

1748
02:00:38,938 --> 02:00:40,458
-I don't know who Sudhakar is.
-Hey!

1749
02:00:40,538 --> 02:00:42,938
-Save me, sir.
-Saravanan!

1750
02:00:43,978 --> 02:00:45,418
Karan, he's lying!

1751
02:00:47,298 --> 02:00:49,298
-Are you staging an act?
-He is lying!

1752
02:00:50,058 --> 02:00:51,458
-They are lying!
-Shut up!

1753
02:00:51,618 --> 02:00:52,898
Get out.

1754
02:00:56,978 --> 02:00:58,058
Get out!

1755
02:01:11,658 --> 02:01:12,618
Father!

1756
02:01:25,018 --> 02:01:26,138
Saravanan!

1757
02:01:31,498 --> 02:01:32,298
See.

1758
02:01:32,778 --> 02:01:34,498
He said he doesn't know Sudhakar.

1759
02:01:38,258 --> 02:01:39,898
Do you want to know who the culprit is?

1760
02:01:39,978 --> 02:01:41,498
Tell him to show us his phone.

1761
02:01:51,658 --> 02:01:52,938
Is he speaking the truth?

1762
02:01:56,818 --> 02:01:58,298
Why did you do it, Dad?

1763
02:01:59,618 --> 02:02:00,538
Answer me, Dad.

1764
02:02:02,938 --> 02:02:04,498
After the boss...

1765
02:02:05,898 --> 02:02:08,178
I thought it would be me.

1766
02:02:09,098 --> 02:02:09,978
But...

1767
02:02:10,418 --> 02:02:11,858
he came from nowhere.

1768
02:02:12,698 --> 02:02:13,698
An heir.

1769
02:02:19,258 --> 02:02:21,418
Being the second best all my life.

1770
02:02:22,378 --> 02:02:23,418
It is a curse.

1771
02:02:25,898 --> 02:02:27,058
You won't get it.

1772
02:02:39,378 --> 02:02:40,338
You believe me now?

1773
02:02:43,098 --> 02:02:44,298
-Sanjana?
-Saravanan.

1774
02:02:52,858 --> 02:02:54,258
Let's go to the police station.

1775
02:03:18,258 --> 02:03:20,138
I didn't expect things
to turn out this way.

1776
02:03:20,258 --> 02:03:22,538
I should be the one saying sorry.

1777
02:03:25,538 --> 02:03:27,138
You shouldn't be alone here.

1778
02:03:27,298 --> 02:03:28,418
Come to my house.

1779
02:03:31,578 --> 02:03:33,018
I need some solitude.

1780
02:03:50,858 --> 02:03:51,738
Saravanan.

1781
02:04:02,338 --> 02:04:03,578
Do you remember this?

1782
02:04:08,458 --> 02:04:09,658
Your key chain.

1783
02:04:10,578 --> 02:04:12,058
The last gift I gave you.

1784
02:04:13,698 --> 02:04:17,898
<span style="style.center_1">I came to your house on your birthday,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I was angry because you weren't there.</span>

1785
02:04:19,218 --> 02:04:21,978
<span style="style.center_1">I thought you'd come to see me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">if I take this with me.</span>

1786
02:04:23,258 --> 02:04:24,458
But you never came.

1787
02:04:26,818 --> 02:04:29,058
The moment I took back
the gift I gave you...

1788
02:04:30,018 --> 02:04:31,498
you left me.

1789
02:04:33,458 --> 02:04:34,298
Now...

1790
02:04:35,338 --> 02:04:36,498
I feel like...

1791
02:04:37,378 --> 02:04:39,418
as long as I have this with me,
I can never have you.

1792
02:04:42,978 --> 02:04:43,818
So...

1793
02:04:44,818 --> 02:04:45,978
Take this back.

1794
02:04:48,418 --> 02:04:49,738
You are all I have.

1795
02:04:50,818 --> 02:04:51,818
I need you.

1796
02:05:13,098 --> 02:05:14,858
Saravanan, what happened?

1797
02:05:18,738 --> 02:05:19,778
I'm not Saravanan.

1798
02:05:20,538 --> 02:05:21,418
I'm Vicky.

1799
02:05:24,858 --> 02:05:26,098
Saravanan is long gone.

1800
02:05:27,818 --> 02:05:30,458
By "gone,"
I don't mean "disappeared."

1801
02:05:31,098 --> 02:05:32,178
I meant "dead."

1802
02:05:35,658 --> 02:05:37,138
Don't you know what happened?

1803
02:05:37,938 --> 02:05:38,818
I'll tell you.

1804
02:05:40,058 --> 02:05:43,778
Saravanan's father, Gnanamoorthy,
is a very busy politician.

1805
02:05:44,338 --> 02:05:45,618
He was very busy

1806
02:05:46,578 --> 02:05:50,298
addicted to politics, he didn't notice
that his son had become a drug addict.

1807
02:05:50,458 --> 02:05:52,058
On Saravanan's birthday

1808
02:05:52,618 --> 02:05:53,938
he fought at home

1809
02:05:54,738 --> 02:05:57,258
and left with money and jewels
to buy drugs.

1810
02:05:57,898 --> 02:06:01,378
He left the town that night,
and never returned for 15 years.

1811
02:06:01,938 --> 02:06:04,378
That's what the family
and the whole town believes.

1812
02:06:05,658 --> 02:06:06,738
But that's not the truth.

1813
02:06:07,858 --> 02:06:08,898
No way.

1814
02:06:10,218 --> 02:06:11,938
He came back the same night.

1815
02:06:13,298 --> 02:06:15,178
And only his father knew that.

1816
02:06:22,418 --> 02:06:24,338
He stood before his father, drugged.

1817
02:06:24,738 --> 02:06:27,418
<span style="style.center_1">Enraged with his son for pushing</span>
<span style="style.center_1">his aged mother down</span>

1818
02:06:27,738 --> 02:06:30,218
<span style="style.center_1">and with himself for not</span>
<span style="style.center_1">paying more attention to his son</span>

1819
02:06:30,738 --> 02:06:32,778
<span style="style.center_1">a fight broke out</span>
<span style="style.center_1">between the father and son.</span>

1820
02:06:33,578 --> 02:06:34,858
<span style="style.center_1">In that fight</span>

1821
02:06:35,058 --> 02:06:36,018
<span style="style.center_1">either accidentally</span>

1822
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:37,258
<span style="style.center_1">or intentionally</span>

1823
02:06:38,338 --> 02:06:39,498
<span style="style.center_1">his father killed him.</span>

1824
02:06:41,338 --> 02:06:42,378
It was election time.

1825
02:06:43,178 --> 02:06:45,298
He feared the consequences
of the matter going public.

1826
02:06:46,178 --> 02:06:47,378
Hungry for power.

1827
02:06:48,778 --> 02:06:51,018
That's when the politician

1828
02:06:51,538 --> 02:06:52,818
turned into a criminal.

1829
02:07:00,138 --> 02:07:01,858
<span style="style.center_1">He stashed his son's body</span>
<span style="style.center_1">in the car trunk,</span>

1830
02:07:02,298 --> 02:07:06,178
<span style="style.center_1">pretended to look for his son</span>
<span style="style.center_1">by driving across the entire town</span>

1831
02:07:06,778 --> 02:07:08,578
<span style="style.center_1">looked for a suitable place</span>
<span style="style.center_1">to bury him</span>

1832
02:07:08,778 --> 02:07:10,898
<span style="style.center_1">and eventually buried</span>
<span style="style.center_1">his body in the forest.</span>

1833
02:07:12,538 --> 02:07:15,218
<span style="style.center_1">With no guilt about killing his son</span>

1834
02:07:15,818 --> 02:07:18,298
he came up with a story
about how the son went missing.

1835
02:07:19,018 --> 02:07:20,338
The family believed him.

1836
02:07:20,898 --> 02:07:23,418
He won the elections
by garnering sympathy votes.

1837
02:07:24,658 --> 02:07:26,498
Everything was going just fine.

1838
02:07:27,138 --> 02:07:28,338
One fine day,

1839
02:07:28,858 --> 02:07:30,378
some guy came into the picture

1840
02:07:30,698 --> 02:07:32,778
to build a resort at the spot
where the son was buried.

1841
02:07:33,738 --> 02:07:36,698
<span style="style.center_1">If they dig up the place,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">they'd find the son's body.</span>

1842
02:07:37,018 --> 02:07:38,218
<span style="style.center_1">He could get caught!</span>

1843
02:07:38,418 --> 02:07:39,538
<span style="style.center_1">To solve that problem</span>

1844
02:07:39,618 --> 02:07:42,098
<span style="style.center_1">he used the pretext</span>
<span style="style.center_1">of people's rights,</span>

1845
02:07:42,338 --> 02:07:44,498
<span style="style.center_1">filed a court case,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and halted the resort construction.</span>

1846
02:07:46,138 --> 02:07:49,058
<span style="style.center_1">The moment he realized</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the verdict might be in their favor</span>

1847
02:07:49,578 --> 02:07:53,058
he arranged for an orphan
from Goa called Vicky

1848
02:07:53,498 --> 02:07:55,218
to pose as his son.

1849
02:07:55,418 --> 02:07:57,098
Even if they find the body now

1850
02:07:57,178 --> 02:07:59,098
he can say that his son is still alive.

1851
02:08:02,138 --> 02:08:03,698
With your political wisdom

1852
02:08:03,938 --> 02:08:05,778
you deserve to be in
national politics, chief!

1853
02:08:06,018 --> 02:08:09,258
Your poor fate, you're stuck in
a tiny dump like Mettupalayam.

1854
02:08:10,378 --> 02:08:14,178
You were aware the man posing as your son
is a criminal, just like you.

1855
02:08:14,338 --> 02:08:16,578
You knew he can't
be around for long.

1856
02:08:16,738 --> 02:08:18,738
So, you treated him like
he were your own son

1857
02:08:18,978 --> 02:08:20,498
and made him your political heir

1858
02:08:20,738 --> 02:08:23,138
thereby turning all your enemies
into his enemies.

1859
02:08:23,658 --> 02:08:25,778
You made him fight
against the resort owners

1860
02:08:26,138 --> 02:08:30,378
hoping that it would work in your favor
irrespective of who killed whom.

1861
02:08:31,458 --> 02:08:34,618
The only thing that went wrong
in your master strategy

1862
02:08:35,498 --> 02:08:36,578
was this.

1863
02:08:38,658 --> 02:08:39,978
So, you know everything.

1864
02:08:40,378 --> 02:08:41,258
Right?

1865
02:08:42,258 --> 02:08:44,058
The only thing
that exists between us now

1866
02:08:45,138 --> 02:08:46,538
is a business deal.

1867
02:08:52,538 --> 02:08:53,858
The money I owe you.

1868
02:08:54,698 --> 02:08:55,978
And all your personal details.

1869
02:08:56,618 --> 02:08:57,698
Everything is in there.

1870
02:08:58,538 --> 02:09:01,818
As long as you don't pose any danger
to me, I won't be of any danger to you.

1871
02:09:01,938 --> 02:09:02,978
Are you threatening me?

1872
02:09:03,498 --> 02:09:05,658
You killed your son for political mileage.

1873
02:09:06,218 --> 02:09:07,618
You're capable of anything.

1874
02:09:08,218 --> 02:09:11,498
I'd go to jail,
to save this family from you.

1875
02:09:11,778 --> 02:09:13,218
I'll make sure you go behind bars.

1876
02:09:14,578 --> 02:09:15,378
Saravanan!

1877
02:09:18,178 --> 02:09:19,138
What is this?

1878
02:09:20,818 --> 02:09:21,858
Forgive me, Mom.

1879
02:09:23,178 --> 02:09:24,338
I am not Saravanan.

1880
02:09:26,538 --> 02:09:27,858
Saravanan isn't alive.

1881
02:09:30,658 --> 02:09:31,898
Your husband killed him.

1882
02:09:37,978 --> 02:09:39,138
You knew it?

1883
02:09:43,018 --> 02:09:46,178
I thought I was the one
cheating all of you.

1884
02:09:48,218 --> 02:09:50,738
But the husband and wife, together,
have been cheating me!

1885
02:09:55,498 --> 02:09:57,818
-What is going on here?
-Oh, no!

1886
02:09:57,938 --> 02:09:58,978
Take your hands off him.

1887
02:10:48,458 --> 02:10:49,858
Get up, boy.

1888
02:10:49,938 --> 02:10:51,858
You dare to push your Grandma!

1889
02:10:51,938 --> 02:10:53,618
-Why are you so spoilt?
-Dad!

1890
02:10:53,738 --> 02:10:55,138
-What do I do with you?
-Dad!

1891
02:10:55,218 --> 02:10:56,978
Don't hit him, dad!

1892
02:10:57,058 --> 02:10:58,578
-Please don't hit him.
-Hey!

1893
02:10:58,858 --> 02:10:59,738
Saravanan!

1894
02:11:00,538 --> 02:11:01,418
Get lost.

1895
02:11:05,338 --> 02:11:06,138
Dad?

1896
02:11:06,218 --> 02:11:07,018
Dad!

1897
02:11:07,098 --> 02:11:07,938
Dad?

1898
02:11:08,138 --> 02:11:10,018
Dad, it's okay.

1899
02:11:10,258 --> 02:11:11,978
Dad, please don't cry.

1900
02:11:12,138 --> 02:11:14,058
Dad, please.
Nothing has happened.

1901
02:11:14,178 --> 02:11:15,818
Dad, it's okay.

1902
02:11:15,938 --> 02:11:17,858
I raised you both the same way.

1903
02:11:18,978 --> 02:11:21,778
But I don't know why
he turned out like this.

1904
02:11:22,298 --> 02:11:24,138
The school principal
spoke to me just yesterday.

1905
02:11:24,738 --> 02:11:26,338
He hit a girl at school.

1906
02:11:27,578 --> 02:11:29,578
I don't know how this will end.

1907
02:11:29,738 --> 02:11:31,178
It will be fine, Dad.

1908
02:11:32,298 --> 02:11:33,098
Saravanan!

1909
02:11:35,258 --> 02:11:37,178
How dare you hit Dad?

1910
02:11:37,298 --> 02:11:38,498
He hit me first.

1911
02:11:38,578 --> 02:11:40,658
So, you'd hit him back?
Such arrogance!

1912
02:11:40,738 --> 02:11:42,418
-Grandma is very critical now!
-Stop it.

1913
02:11:42,498 --> 02:11:43,978
What did you do to that girl?

1914
02:11:44,098 --> 02:11:45,778
I'm ashamed to call you my brother.

1915
02:11:46,578 --> 02:11:47,938
-What is this?
-Give it to me.

1916
02:11:48,018 --> 02:11:49,858
-This is the cause of all the problems.
-Give it to me.

1917
02:11:49,938 --> 02:11:51,298
-I won't.
-I said, give it to me.

1918
02:11:51,378 --> 02:11:52,498
I won't give it to you!

1919
02:11:56,938 --> 02:11:59,978
Do you have any idea what I went
through to get that? Do you?

1920
02:12:00,058 --> 02:12:00,978
Die!

1921
02:12:02,458 --> 02:12:04,138
Will you and your father never get it?

1922
02:12:04,418 --> 02:12:07,178
I'll be at peace only when you die.

1923
02:12:09,818 --> 02:12:11,458
Die! Die!

1924
02:12:14,098 --> 02:12:15,738
Dad!

1925
02:12:20,418 --> 02:12:21,298
Saravanan!

1926
02:12:21,658 --> 02:12:22,538
Saravanan?

1927
02:12:23,818 --> 02:12:24,698
Saravanan?

1928
02:12:31,378 --> 02:12:33,298
Oh, no! We need to go
to the hospital.

1929
02:12:33,378 --> 02:12:35,098
Dad, let's take him
to the hospital.

1930
02:12:35,178 --> 02:12:36,258
Saravanan?

1931
02:12:36,658 --> 02:12:37,538
Saravanan!

1932
02:12:37,858 --> 02:12:38,738
Saravanan?

1933
02:12:39,058 --> 02:12:39,978
Saravanan!

1934
02:12:43,618 --> 02:12:44,778
Dad, I killed him.

1935
02:12:44,938 --> 02:12:45,978
-Saravanan.
-I killed him.

1936
02:12:46,138 --> 02:12:48,298
Dad, it was a mistake.
He tried to choke me.

1937
02:12:48,378 --> 02:12:49,818
-I didn't meant to.
--Saravanan.

1938
02:12:49,898 --> 02:12:51,938
I don't know how it happened.

1939
02:12:52,018 --> 02:12:54,618
Oh, no! I killed him.

1940
02:12:54,738 --> 02:12:57,698
-I killed my own brother.
-No, listen to me.

1941
02:12:57,778 --> 02:12:59,338
I killed him.

1942
02:12:59,418 --> 02:13:01,218
Don't shout!
Don't shout!

1943
02:13:01,698 --> 02:13:05,458
-Parvathy, listen to me.
-Dad...

1944
02:13:07,378 --> 02:13:08,818
Dad, call the police.

1945
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:11,298
-I'll go to jail.
-No, let's not call the police.

1946
02:13:11,378 --> 02:13:13,538
-I killed my own brother.
-Not the police...

1947
02:13:13,618 --> 02:13:15,298
-Not the police.
-I'll surrender, Dad.

1948
02:13:15,378 --> 02:13:16,578
-Saravanan...
-Dad!

1949
02:13:16,658 --> 02:13:19,538
-Dad, let me go to the police.
-You didn't kill Saravanan.

1950
02:13:19,938 --> 02:13:22,378
Saravanan is not dead.
He is not dead.

1951
02:13:23,178 --> 02:13:25,378
Saravanan ran away.

1952
02:13:25,578 --> 02:13:26,778
He ran away

1953
02:13:26,858 --> 02:13:28,178
and never returned.

1954
02:13:28,258 --> 02:13:30,178
No one should know about this.

1955
02:13:30,258 --> 02:13:31,298
He was a drug addict.

1956
02:13:31,498 --> 02:13:32,778
And had a weakness for women.

1957
02:13:32,858 --> 02:13:34,058
If word gets out

1958
02:13:34,778 --> 02:13:38,538
people will come up with their own stories
and blow this thing up.

1959
02:13:38,618 --> 02:13:40,058
Dad!

1960
02:13:40,138 --> 02:13:41,938
Your future.
Your marriage.

1961
02:13:42,018 --> 02:13:42,858
Our family's honor.

1962
02:13:43,218 --> 02:13:44,338
We will lose everything.

1963
02:13:44,418 --> 02:13:45,338
-Listen...
-Dad!

1964
02:13:45,418 --> 02:13:46,698
Be brave.

1965
02:13:46,858 --> 02:13:47,858
Your dad is here for you.

1966
02:13:48,178 --> 02:13:49,378
I'll take you to the hospital.

1967
02:13:49,458 --> 02:13:51,538
-Help Mom and take care of your grandma.
-No, Dad.

1968
02:13:52,418 --> 02:13:54,378
Saravanan never returned home.

1969
02:13:55,498 --> 02:13:56,938
Saravanan ran away.

1970
02:13:57,458 --> 02:13:59,018
Saravanan never came back.

1971
02:13:59,258 --> 02:14:00,898
Saravanan ran away.

1972
02:14:01,658 --> 02:14:03,338
Saravanan ran away from home.

1973
02:14:22,618 --> 02:14:25,418
I didn't want anyone outside
the family to discover this secret.

1974
02:14:26,258 --> 02:14:27,858
So, I committed all those crimes.

1975
02:14:31,218 --> 02:14:32,298
You are a good man.

1976
02:14:35,738 --> 02:14:36,618
But...

1977
02:14:37,218 --> 02:14:39,018
But my daughter's life
is more important to me.

1978
02:14:39,258 --> 02:14:40,178
Don't, Dad.

1979
02:14:42,418 --> 02:14:44,338
I can't lose my brother again.

1980
02:14:46,298 --> 02:14:47,658
To hide one crime

1981
02:14:48,058 --> 02:14:49,418
we've committed several others.

1982
02:14:52,378 --> 02:14:53,298
Enough, Dad.

1983
02:14:59,618 --> 02:15:01,418
My daughter committed a crime
by accident

1984
02:15:02,818 --> 02:15:04,618
and she's been suffering for 15 years.

1985
02:15:06,298 --> 02:15:08,378
But I committed
all those crimes intentionally.

1986
02:15:09,698 --> 02:15:11,138
I'll take the blame for everything.

1987
02:15:18,938 --> 02:15:19,778
Sir!

1988
02:15:28,138 --> 02:15:29,258
Sir!

1989
02:15:42,378 --> 02:15:44,698
-Sir, thank you very much.
-We are very happy.

1990
02:15:44,778 --> 02:15:46,218
-Thank you, sir!
-Thank you!

1991
02:15:46,298 --> 02:15:51,098
-You have saved all our people, sir.
-Bless you!

1992
02:15:51,218 --> 02:15:53,498
-You should live long, sir.
-Sir.

1993
02:15:53,698 --> 02:15:55,058
Sir, we won this case.

1994
02:15:55,138 --> 02:15:57,178
This land belongs to our people now.

1995
02:15:57,338 --> 02:16:00,018
No one can build a hotel
or a resort there.

1996
02:16:00,098 --> 02:16:01,138
Thank you so much.

1997
02:16:01,218 --> 02:16:04,538
-May you live long!
-May your family prosper!

1998
02:16:05,738 --> 02:16:08,018
Your son has brought us luck.
Where is he?

1999
02:16:08,938 --> 02:16:10,658
-We want to see him.
-Yes.

2000
02:16:10,778 --> 02:16:12,098
Ask him to come out.

2001
02:16:25,058 --> 02:16:26,578
Long live, Gnanamoorthy.

2002
02:16:26,658 --> 02:16:27,978
Long live, Gnanamoorthy.

2003
02:16:28,058 --> 02:16:29,698
Long live, Gnanamoorthy.

2004
02:16:29,818 --> 02:16:31,658
Long live, Gnanamoorthy.

2005
02:16:56,898 --> 02:16:57,898
Where are you going?

2006
02:17:01,058 --> 02:17:02,178
I don't have a family.

2007
02:17:03,618 --> 02:17:05,098
I just go wherever the train takes me.

2008
02:17:07,938 --> 02:17:10,898
We don't have the right
to ask you to stay here.

2009
02:17:12,498 --> 02:17:15,378
You've only seen trouble
ever since you came here.

2010
02:17:16,378 --> 02:17:18,498
You would be happy
if you go back.

2011
02:17:21,258 --> 02:17:22,938
That was no life at all, sister.

2012
02:17:24,458 --> 02:17:26,258
I don't know where I was born.

2013
02:17:28,178 --> 02:17:29,538
I didn't know what "family" meant.

2014
02:17:29,778 --> 02:17:31,698
Mother, father,

2015
02:17:31,978 --> 02:17:34,578
and a sibling's love,
I learnt about it only here.

2016
02:17:36,658 --> 02:17:38,178
I don't deserve that.

2017
02:17:41,498 --> 02:17:42,898
We are no better.

2018
02:17:44,418 --> 02:17:45,818
We committed such a big crime

2019
02:17:46,698 --> 02:17:48,938
but we pretend to live like good people.

2020
02:17:49,778 --> 02:17:50,898
Don't say that, sister.

2021
02:17:51,978 --> 02:17:53,498
I came here to pose as your brother.

2022
02:17:53,738 --> 02:17:55,018
But when I was hurt,

2023
02:17:55,258 --> 02:17:56,578
you cared for me.

2024
02:17:59,458 --> 02:18:00,578
He was a bad son.

2025
02:18:01,418 --> 02:18:03,098
And it was an accident.

2026
02:18:04,898 --> 02:18:06,338
Unable to speak about it,

2027
02:18:06,698 --> 02:18:09,698
I can understand the trauma and guilt
your family must have gone through.

2028
02:18:11,978 --> 02:18:14,698
So many sacrifices go into
the well-being of a family.

2029
02:18:18,538 --> 02:18:21,458
Having an older sister
is the equivalent of two mothers.

2030
02:18:22,978 --> 02:18:26,298
A younger brother knows that very well.

2031
02:18:28,258 --> 02:18:29,738
He wasn't lucky.

2032
02:18:30,538 --> 02:18:32,178
Just because he was born
to my parents...

2033
02:18:33,258 --> 02:18:34,378
doesn't make him my brother.

2034
02:18:40,258 --> 02:18:41,978
Whether it was the truth or a lie,

2035
02:18:42,058 --> 02:18:45,098
Mom and Dad have been happy
only after you came.

2036
02:18:51,698 --> 02:18:52,738
Don't leave us.

2037
02:19:15,858 --> 02:19:17,258
Crying over a lost brother...

2038
02:19:19,658 --> 02:19:21,218
is not new to me.

2039
02:19:24,538 --> 02:19:25,338
Go.

2040
02:19:26,178 --> 02:19:27,018
Be happy.

2041
02:19:54,418 --> 02:19:55,298
You're not leaving?

2042
02:19:56,058 --> 02:19:57,178
I don't have money
for the tickets.

2043
02:19:57,258 --> 02:19:58,258
I can give you the money.

2044
02:19:58,618 --> 02:20:01,138
-Speak that way, and I'll really go!
-Shut up.

2045
02:20:03,658 --> 02:20:05,138
Take a shower once we get home.

2046
02:20:05,218 --> 02:20:06,018
You stink.

2047
02:20:06,098 --> 02:20:09,258
Look, my first condition is,
don't ask me to shower every day.

2048
02:20:09,378 --> 02:20:10,298
I can't.

2049
02:20:10,458 --> 02:20:12,018
It's not like you shower every day now.

2050
02:20:12,258 --> 02:20:14,378
Second condition.
I will drink at least once a week.

2051
02:20:14,458 --> 02:20:15,938
Oh? I'll have a word with Mom.

2052
02:20:16,058 --> 02:20:17,698
No, no. I'll handle that.

2053
02:20:18,258 --> 02:20:20,178
Third condition.
You must get married soon.

2054
02:20:20,298 --> 02:20:23,018
-I can do my thing then.
-Won't you get married if I don't?

2055
02:20:23,098 --> 02:20:25,418
I can't live like Abdul Kalam.
No way! Let me go.

2056
02:20:25,498 --> 02:20:26,658
I'll go away.
