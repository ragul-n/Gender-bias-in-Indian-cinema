1
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,042
Surprise!

2
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,296
Thanks for helping this summer.
Have a great year at school, Paige.

3
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,228
Hey, what happened
to the Lamborghini?

4
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,148
I'm quite bored of the Lamborghini.
Ready to lose?

5
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,025
I've won Grand Prix.
What have you won?

6
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,443
Nothing.

7
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,902
And you're gonna beat me
in your mummy's limo?

8
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,031
To be correct, Mr. Irvine, I'm going
to beat you in my mummy's limo,

9
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,283
to which I've made
numerous modifications.

10
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,160
So you should be afraid, my friend.

11
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,580
Not half as afraid as you're gonna
be when your mummy finds out.

12
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,933
- Hey, how was it?
- Oh, it was great.

13
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,894
They had a going-away
Danish for me.

14
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,189
And as soon as I blew out the candle,
Trey Carlson came in

15
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,566
with this huge bloody gash
on his forehead.

16
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,235
- He tried to give himself a haircut.
- Good going, Trey.

17
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,696
The cool part was they let me
stitch it up for him.

18
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,366
- Time check?
- 9:45.

19
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,216
Racers ready?

20
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,426
Go.

21
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,008
Hi.

22
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,624
No!

23
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,879
Look out!

24
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,638
Hi.

25
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,685
Great dress.

26
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,696
Good race, Your Highness.

27
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,364
Not exactly the way
I wanted to win.

28
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,991
It'd been better if you hadn't
lifted your foot off at the end.

29
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,745
- No, you did great.
- Congratulations.

30
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,939
- And then there were two.
- It's not that bad.

31
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,776
No, they seem really happy. I...

32
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,113
I just remember how much we used
to talk about getting out there

33
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,698
and following our dreams.

34
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,494
There's a whole world out there to see.
You too. We're the last holdouts.

35
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,666
Todd and I are engaged.

36
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,379
- Don't hate me.
- That's great.

37
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,009
- Why would I hate you? No.
- Oh, thanks.

38
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,678
- OK, ladies.
- Oh, look.

39
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,472
Betsy's throwing the bouquet.

40
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,017
Are you ready, ladies?

41
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:19,939
One, two, three.

42
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,566
I caught it!

43
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,969
- He is late every time.
- Yes.

44
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,389
It's OK, I've got it.
Thank you.

45
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,392
Thank you.

46
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,769
- Edvard.
- Hi, Ari.

47
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,566
His Majesty, the king.
Her Majesty, the queen.

48
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,945
His Royal Highness, the crown prince.

49
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,531
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Arabella.

50
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,634
Here we are, honey.

51
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,972
- Hope to see you at Thanksgiving.
- All right, I love you, Dad.

52
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,391
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye. Thanks.

53
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,732
- Hello?
- Paige, hey.

54
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,233
- How's it going?
- Oh, my God.

55
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,402
Good. How psyched
are you to be back?

56
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,863
Yeah, but this year we do the dishes
every three weeks

57
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,531
whether we need to or not.

58
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,242
And by "we", I mean you.

59
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,412
Oh, look what my dad
hooked me up with.

60
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,335
Yeah. He may be totally
inaccessible emotionally,

61
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,338
but he does know how
to install some really cool crap.

62
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,424
Well, enjoy it. I'll be lucky
if I'm ever home this year.

63
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:13,136
I've got a five-hour chem lab, plus
med-school applications and work.

64
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,638
Hey, hey, classes
haven't even started yet.

65
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,474
Before you start saving the world,

66
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,893
you could come to the Rat
with me, Stacey and Amanda.

67
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,232
So at this point in the trip, me and
the other tour leaders are just...

68
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,068
- We're fed up with all these
- OK, OK.

69
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,612
rich, snotty kids
and all of their complaining.

70
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,950
So one night in Rome,
we go to this bar,

71
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,748
and I kind of slept with a 45-year-old
cheesy ltalian guy.

72
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,333
Forty-five? Wow.

73
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,920
Well, he was cute
in a Mussolini kind of way.

74
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,549
- What are you gals talking about?
- Our love for older, virile men like you.

75
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,637
A few more of these and believe me,
I'll be the best-looking guy in here.

76
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,890
- Then you better take Stacey's away.
- Oh, yes, please.

77
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,103
- You want back on the work rotation?
- Yeah, definitely.

78
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,230
- How's tomorrow?
- How's Thursday?

79
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,816
- How's tomorrow?
- Tomorrow it is.

80
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,609
All right.
This round's on me.

81
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,403
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

82
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,904
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

83
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,952
I can't believe you got
to see all of Europe.

84
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,705
I wish I could fast-forward
through the next five years...

85
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,124
I hate when she starts
to talk about her life plan.

86
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,710
- It makes me feel so unfocused.
- Tell me about it.

87
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,421
I'm a senior, and I've changed
my major, like, six times.

88
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,506
- I don't even have a major.
- Oh, please.

89
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,467
By the time you get one,
Paige will be done with Johns Hopkins.

90
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,970
- That's if I get in.
- You'll get in.

91
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,098
No. Not after this semester.
I have to take Shakespeare.

92
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,017
Some sort of stupid
humanities requirement.

93
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,936
That's it. The next time you talk
about classes or work,

94
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,354
you have to do a shot.

95
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,398
It's just that Shakespeare
is so useless...

96
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,066
Stop.

97
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,569
- Hey, guys, I need this.
- Hey.

98
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,404
- Here you go.
- No.

99
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,657
- No, come on.
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

100
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,701
- What is this?
- Drink it. Drink it.

101
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,703
- It's your first night.
- Cheers.

102
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,248
- Cheers.
- That's good.

103
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,754
Oh, I hate you guys.

104
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,924
Did you read all the prepared
research materials?

105
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,384
Of course.

106
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,803
Edvard, one day,
you will be the 51 st ruler

107
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,388
of the longest continuous monarchy

108
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,891
- in the history of the world.
- Yes, I'm aware, Father.

109
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,977
It's a monarchy that still requires
the participation of the king

110
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,563
in the workings and decisions
of the government.

111
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,193
So if I ask you if you're prepared,
it's not an insignificant question.

112
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,028
Father, I'm prepared, OK?

113
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,201
His Majesty, the king.

114
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,792
And His Royal Highness,
the crown prince.

115
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,461
- Your Majesty.
- I'm all right.

116
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,757
- Prime minister.
- Your Royal Highness.

117
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,510
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
let's get started.

118
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,263
But a six-percent pay increase
is the least

119
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,099
the national unions will accept.

120
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,142
- That's unconscionable.
- Look.

121
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,145
If we can't agree, how are we
gonna get the two sides together?

122
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,563
This is blackmail.

123
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,149
All right, we'll have to make
other concessions then.

124
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,568
Is there no end
to the workers' demands?

125
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,365
Our government must refuse
to give in to the unions at all costs.

126
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,991
I appreciate your ardor, Thomas,

127
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,828
but I assure you they are very serious
about the deadline.

128
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,996
Without concessions,
they will strike.

129
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,958
A nationwide strike will be
disastrous for our economy.

130
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,585
Edvard, I'm sure we'd all like
to know what you think.

131
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,297
Sorry, what was the question?

132
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,510
I was... I was busy.

133
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,555
I see.

134
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,100
I don't know why my father
insists I go with him.

135
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,770
- I've always detested those meetings.
- Yes, sir.

136
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,273
Perhaps it has something
to do with the fact that,

137
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,525
I don't know, you're going
to be king someday.

138
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,902
Yes, don't remind me, Soren.

139
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,614
You're very lucky you're not me,
let me tell you.

140
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,702
If you want to change places, sir,
call me day or night.

141
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,458
You know my mother's
gonna go crazy

142
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,585
when she finds out
what happened today.

143
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,546
It's a speech I definitely
don't want to hear.

144
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,716
I need to get out of Denmark,
Soren. I need to clear my head.

145
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:24,054
Oh, yes, and where would you like
to clear your head this time, sir?

146
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,098
I hear the slopes are opening
early in St. Moritz this year.

147
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,017
Monte Carlo has opened a new casino.

148
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,436
Dropping a few hundred thousand
kroner always seems

149
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,147
to have worked miracles in the past.

150
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,982
Warning.
The following commercial...

151
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,901
Wait, no time for that.
Watch this!

152
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,445
For years, Desperate Dan
has been talking real women

153
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,865
into doing the most outrageous things.
And he's captured it all on tape.

154
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,409
And now Desperate Dan takes you
to America's heartland

155
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,995
to bring you Wild College Girls:

156
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,456
The Girls of Wisconsin.

157
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,836
Oh, please. Come on, take your
top off for us. Come on, Just once.

158
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,506
- Wisconsin?
- Yes.

159
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,341
Why there, son?

160
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,928
Because I've never spent
much time in America before.

161
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,263
And I'd rather go
to the heart of the country

162
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,683
where I can meet ordinary Americans.

163
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,311
Plus, there's a well-respected
university with interesting programs

164
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,564
and a wide variety
of extracurricular activities.

165
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,818
But this is absurd.

166
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,529
Look, I see this as a real
opportunity to find myself.

167
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,323
Oh, Edvard, please.

168
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:30,537
This is just another
in a series of escapades.

169
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,499
Which, by the way, we finance.

170
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,962
Inevitably ending up with you
in some tabloid, embarrassing us

171
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,923
and forcing you to come back
to the palace to hide yourself

172
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,926
until you convince us you have to go
and find yourself yet again.

173
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,012
If I'm the embarrassment
you believe me to be,

174
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,763
then maybe you should cut me off.

175
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,100
- Well, what are you saying?
- I'm saying I want to go and I'm going.

176
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,103
And I neither require your money
nor your permission.

177
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:02,110
- Edvard!
- I will do this on my own, Mother!

178
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,741
Let him go.

179
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,119
We've tried evertyhing else,
and it doesn't work, so...

180
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,081
Frankly, it's encouraging
he even wants to try.

181
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,169
Soren. You will go with him.

182
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,963
Me, Your Majesty?

183
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,548
On my own?

184
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,176
Surely there's a caretaker
better suited than...

185
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,805
I will arrange for our departure.

186
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,867
- Hey!
- Slow down.

187
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,291
Just look at them all, Soren.

188
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,795
Thousands upon thousands of young,
crazy college girls getting drunk

189
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,714
- and taking their tops off.
- Yes, sir, what a treat for us

190
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,925
that it's happening here
in America's dairy land.

191
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,554
Breeding ground of the coronary
bypass patients of the world.

192
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,306
Look at her.

193
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,892
Your parents are expecting you
to attend your classes,

194
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,395
- Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, I know.

195
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,563
Listen, Soren.

196
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,316
From this point forward,
I do not want you to address me

197
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,777
as the prince
or Your Royal Highness.

198
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,906
You will address me as...Eddie.

199
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,117
Yes, Eddie.

200
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,161
The last thing I need right now
is to have the press all over me.

201
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,457
- I think it's gonna be fun.
- I'm having a wonderful time already.

202
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,961
- Are you unhappy, Soren?
- What gave me away, sir?

203
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,965
I don't know. Your expression
never changes.

204
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,926
- Do you even know how to smile?
- Yes.

205
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,786
Oh, Soren, this is us.

206
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,999
Good heavens.

207
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,549
I thought you had to be
convicted of a crime

208
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,676
before you lived
somewhere like this.

209
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,681
It's not that bad.

210
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,395
Plus, we haven't seen
the rest of it yet.

211
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,026
Apparently, this is the rest of it.

212
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,033
Well, I like it. And I'll even let you
have first choice of the beds.

213
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,743
Oh, heavens.

214
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,788
Which stained mattress
shall I choose?

215
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,629
You the new guys?

216
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,924
I'm Scotty.

217
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:16,513
All right, all my food's labeled,
so I'll know if you ate anything.

218
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:22,268
I'm allergic to dairy, shellfish,
red meat, melon, nuts and kiwi.

219
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,313
So don't bring any
of that stuff around here.

220
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:32,445
The Xbox is off-limits.
If you screw up any of my high scores,

221
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,615
I'll blind you with my laser pointer.

222
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,913
Now, this... This is the real university
life I was talking about.

223
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,542
You see, here, we're just two
typical college students.

224
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,713
Absolutely, sir. I, for one, can't wait
to raucously cheer on the fellows

225
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,216
of the tackle football team
as they challenge the Gophers,

226
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,220
our hated rivals, who apparently hail
from a place called Minnesota.

227
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:01,266
Minnesota sucks!
Wisconsin rules!

228
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,502
No, no.

229
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,549
Waitress, we'd like to see
some menus, please.

230
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,635
I'm not a waitress, there are no
menus, and the kitchen's closed.

231
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,097
Well, then what can you offer us?

232
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,270
I can offer you beer and pretzel rods,
my fine fellow, at ye old pub yonder.

233
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:58,239
- Shall I go to the bar, sir?
- Yes. Yes, two of these. Two beers.

234
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,657
Very good.

235
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,506
Would you like another, sir?

236
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,598
- Yes, I'll get these.
- Thank you very much, sir.

237
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,153
- Hello again.
- What can I get for you?

238
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,657
I was hoping you could
recommend something better

239
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,242
than what we've been drinking.

240
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,828
Well, for the discerning
out-of-towner like yourself,

241
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,373
I recommend Leinenkugel's. You can
really taste the extra 1 0 cents.

242
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,376
Yes, by all means. Two, please.

243
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,560
You know, if we were in Germany
right now, we'd be underground.

244
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,730
- What?
- Rathskeller, it means basement.

245
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,566
OK.

246
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,153
Yes, perhaps I should've known
better than to flirt in German.

247
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,863
Perhaps.

248
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,490
It's not a very attractive language, is it?

249
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,659
No.

250
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:32,042
- I'm Eddie.
- Paige.

251
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,215
- So will you take your top off for me?
- What?

252
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,427
Take your top off for me
like Wild College Girls.

253
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:46,306
Just a quick look. No one's watching.
Just take it off for me.

254
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,272
- You, time to go.
- Just calm down.

255
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,107
- No, you calm down.
- Get off me.

256
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,401
- You get out.
- Get your hands off me.

257
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,778
Out. Go on!

258
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:04,282
Science is a never-ending quest.

259
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:10,413
For anyone planning a future
in science, an open mind is a must.

260
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,082
Grading is as follows:

261
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,503
Forty percent, procedure.

262
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,507
Fifty percent, lab work.
And ten...

263
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,177
May I help you?

264
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:31,101
Yes. I believe I'm signed up
for this class.

265
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:37,607
Fine, Mr. Williams. Next time be here
by 8:20, or you'll be locked out.

266
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,695
And what about you?
I'm talking to you, sir.

267
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,949
- I'm auditing.
- Not this class, too small.

268
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,784
Take a seat, Mr. Williams.

269
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:52,455
As I was saying,
forty percent, procedure.

270
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,916
- Fifty percent, lab work.
- You can wait outside.

271
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,210
- You'll be all right, sir?
- And ten percent...

272
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,088
- Yes, just wait outside.
- You know, if this is a "lovers' thing",

273
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,840
could you please take it
in the hall?

274
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,010
Soren, just go. Go.

275
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,264
My sincerest apologies.

276
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:19,983
Oh, please proceed.

277
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,697
And ten percent, attendance.

278
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:29,951
You will find a list in front of you
of your supplies

279
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,912
and the experiment
you will be conducting.

280
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:37,625
Now, I want you to turn to the person
next to you and introduce yourself.

281
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:42,380
Congratulations, folks, you've just said
hello to your permanent lab partner.

282
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,762
Hey. Hey.

283
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,514
You forgot your supply list.

284
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:54,184
Oh, right, thank you.

285
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,772
- Listen, what's your name again?
- Eddie.

286
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,274
Eddie. Right.
This class is really important to me

287
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,818
because I need this teacher
to get me into med school.

288
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,737
And if I'm stuck with you
as my partner,

289
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:08,406
I can't afford to have you
screw things up for me, OK?

290
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:12,410
It's very important to me, as well.
I love organic chemistry.

291
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,580
I've recently discovered
that large amounts

292
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,792
of alcohol mixed with a carbon-based
life form causes the life form

293
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:23,546
to blurt out stupid things.
So apologies to the other night.

294
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,548
I was just having some fun.

295
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,968
Of course you were. And I love being
made to feel like a brainless slut

296
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:31,846
by some sloppy lush. Thanks.

297
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:35,725
I have learned me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition

298
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,063
To you and your behest, I am enjoined
And beg your pardon

299
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,774
Is he drunk now?

300
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,069
It's a play. Romeo and Juliet?

301
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,656
Shakespeare?

302
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,368
This is gonna be a fun semester.

303
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,954
Don't forget your half
of the supplies next time.

304
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,300
You would think that
after spraying somebody

305
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:13,221
with high-powered soda,
he'd get the message to stay away.

306
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:16,433
Well, I think he's pretty hot.

307
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,685
Hot? Oh, my God, Beth,
he is so affected.

308
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:24,441
He was quoting Shakespeare, like
some Shakespearean-duke-lord guy.

309
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,276
I hate phonies like that.

310
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,696
So are you saying you wouldn't
take him up to the stacks?

311
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:34,451
OK. A, going at it in the dusty stacks
of the library is fairly disgusting.

312
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,954
And B, you literally say that
about every hot guy.

313
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,497
Oh, so you admit he's hot.

314
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,332
OK, I'm done having
this conversation.

315
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,419
I need to concentrate
on my applications.

316
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:51,926
And what's with his weird friend
who's always hanging around?

317
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:56,556
One partner is monitoring
temperature and flow,

318
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:02,687
while the other pours the hydrochloric
acid into the separatory funnel.

319
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,647
Now...

320
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,985
...carefully turn the stopcock

321
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:14,741
to allow some of the solution
to flow into the round-bottom flask.

322
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,299
Start over again.

323
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,305
Where is he?

324
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,186
- You're still in bed?
- Good morning, miss.

325
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,854
Would you care for some breakfast?

326
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,732
I spent the last two hours
looking like an incompetent idiot

327
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,776
because my lab partner
didn't show up.

328
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,528
- Was that this morning?
- Yes!

329
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,321
You know, I know exactly
who you are.

330
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,739
- You do?
- You do?

331
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,617
You're a spoiled, little rich kid
who sees college as a detour

332
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,035
on the way to an easy life.

333
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,578
No character.
No accomplishments.

334
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:04,207
- Just a royal pain in the ass.
- You're completely wrong.

335
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,837
See, unlike people who are given
evertyhing, I have to earn what I get.

336
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,755
But that is the beauty
of a meritocracy.

337
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,258
People rise and fall
based on how hard they work.

338
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:15,010
Would you like some
more hollandaise?

339
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,013
- No, that's good. Thank you.
- You're making eggs Benedict?

340
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:21,433
- On a hot plate in a dorm room?
- Yes, just a typical student breakfast.

341
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,935
Would you care to join us?

342
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,353
No, thank you.

343
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:29,983
- So where's your statue?
- What statue?

344
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,943
Someone as righteous as you
must have

345
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,445
a statue of themselves
somewhere.

346
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,156
There's a difference between
being righteous and being right.

347
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:39,117
I happen to be right. Could you
please put a shirt on or something?

348
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:42,495
If you're going to be a doctor,
you'll have to get used to naked men.

349
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,623
Dude! Dude, there's a chick
in our room.

350
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,501
- Just drop the class.
- No.

351
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,379
Well, then you better be there,
and you better be prepared.

352
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,390
She really meant those things,
didn't she?

353
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,726
Yes, she did seem rather upset, sir.

354
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:08,730
Though, regardless,
I don't see why you would care.

355
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,610
Do enjoy the eggs, sir. They were
purchased with the last of your money.

356
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,279
- We have some left, don't we?
- What you came with is gone.

357
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:19,783
Well, you're getting some
sort of paycheck, aren't you?

358
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,206
Hey, you cheap Swede.

359
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:31,628
"Skills: polo, fencing, speak French,
English, German, Dutch,

360
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,338
"Danish and Flemish".

361
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,008
Flemish? Is there
a country called Flem?

362
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,681
Look, that's all great,
but it doesn't mean crap to me.

363
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,433
I need somebody with work
experience, and you don't have any.

364
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,185
I really could do
with the employment.

365
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,729
There are a lot of students
who wanna work here.

366
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:52,649
Well, I have the highest
recommendation.

367
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,027
- Hey, Paige.
- Hi.

368
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,705
Are you deliberately trying
to make me miserable?

369
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,290
No, I'm simply manning
the delicatessen in the event

370
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,043
that one of my fellow students
wants a tasty sandwich.

371
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:16,214
- Stu, did you hire this guy?
- Yeah. He came highly recommended.

372
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,716
- By whom?
- You.

373
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,634
- What would you like?
- A turkey sandwich.

374
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:23,555
Paige, I'm busy. Eddie's your boy.
You're in charge of him.

375
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,683
All right, it seems we're completely
out of turkey today.

376
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,686
Dude, there's like ten turkey
things in there.

377
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,607
Is this some sort of test?

378
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,444
Did Johns Hopkins send you to see
if I can handle pressure?

379
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:40,488
- Because I'm starting to crack.
- Well, who's in charge of carving?

380
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,824
- Use the slicer.
- What's that?

381
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:49,289
You used me as a reference.

382
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,374
Yes. Look, you were
the only one I knew.

383
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,169
Despite what you think,
I do need this job. I have no money.

384
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,004
But you have a personal egg poacher.

385
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,340
No, no. He's just another student.

386
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,092
Really? What's he studying?
How to be a 30-year-old junior?

387
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,219
Try the "on" button.

388
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:11,102
Look, Paige. You were right
about my parents back in Denmark.

389
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,188
They are from a certain wealth.

390
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,856
But I've cut myself off from them.

391
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,483
Dude.

392
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,610
Yes, just one minute.

393
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:25,200
Listen, Paige. I realize I've taken
advantage of you recently, and...

394
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:28,953
But just give me a chance today, and
if I cause any problems, then I'll quit.

395
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:35,669
OK. Your right hand
goes on the handle.

396
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,921
Slowly slide the meat
back and forth.

397
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:41,216
And unless you want
a turkey-thumb sandwich,

398
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,843
don't put your hand near
the blade when it's moving, OK?

399
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,387
Right.

400
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,639
OK.

401
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,233
- Slowly, slowly.
- Right.

402
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,734
Right.

403
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,112
OK, nice and smooth.

404
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,790
That's enough.

405
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:28,138
- Here, Paige, it's your turn tonight.
- OK.

406
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:47,175
Hey, kid.

407
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:50,595
I need you to go outside
and hose down the mats.

408
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,484
Are you sure you don't
want a hand, sir?

409
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,986
- No, I'm fine.
- Good night.

410
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,118
Hey.

411
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,746
You did OK in there.

412
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:20,000
- You can't be serious, can you?
- Well, by "OK", I mean

413
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,545
spilling a ton of beer
and screwing up everyone's order.

414
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:28,299
- Yeah.
- No, you'll be fine.

415
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:38,435
You know, this Saturday evening,
there's a dorm party at Brenner Hall.

416
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:39,894
A gathering.

417
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,274
I was wondering if you would like
to accompany me.

418
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,651
Accompany you?

419
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:50,196
Oh, right, yes.
How do you say it colloquially?

420
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:53,241
Yo, dog, there's a mad party
kicking at my crib,

421
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,911
if you want to roll
down there with me.

422
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,832
That was just sad.
Don't ever do that again.

423
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,001
Yes, I really hurt my finger.

424
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,295
So would you like to come?

425
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:11,593
I...

426
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,346
I'm actually kind of busy.

427
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:19,559
Oh, dear.

428
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:25,940
- What?
- I believe you just got rejected, sir.

429
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:30,278
You know, I don't think that's ever
happened to me before.

430
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,030
You've never been attracted
to anyone

431
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,199
who didn't know
you were a prince before.

432
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,243
I wouldn't get too worked up
over it, sir.

433
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:40,372
The chances of a relationship
between yourself and Miss Paige

434
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,956
are not promising.

435
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:45,210
You two are of
a completely different caliber.

436
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:49,589
Soren, just because she isn't royalty
doesn't mean she's not important.

437
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,841
The higher caliber
I was referring to, sir,

438
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:53,760
was hers.

439
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:55,720
What?

440
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,357
Miss.

441
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,779
You really must get some rest,
Your Majesty.

442
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:16,074
I'm relieved there wasn't
more to it than this.

443
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:19,786
- There'll be more of these tests, yes?
- I can't say for sure.

444
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:21,871
- There'll be several tests?
- There might be.

445
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:24,249
- Will this take many days?
- No, I'm pretty sure

446
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,668
- we can get them out of the way.
- Thank you, doctor.

447
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:29,462
I don't think you need to go to this.

448
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:32,841
- I promised I'd go.
- Are you feeling ill, Daddy?

449
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,931
There's nothing to worry about,
my darling.

450
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:42,142
Yes, Arabella.

451
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,477
You shouldn't worry.

452
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,730
Just a little flu.

453
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:50,066
Excuse me, ma'am.
It's time for His Majesty to be going.

454
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,985
Sweetie.

455
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:56,406
So, what would you like to do today?

456
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:58,825
- Horse riding.
- Good idea.

457
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:00,827
Duty calls.

458
00:36:12,047 --> 00:36:13,673
Shit.

459
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:26,978
Positive for ketone.

460
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:31,775
Mr. Williams, please do something.

461
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:40,825
So you know the other day
when you quoted Romeo and Juliet?

462
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,244
- Yes.
- Well, it's funny

463
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:48,249
because I'm actually taking
a Shakespeare class myself and...

464
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,252
I'm not struggling,
I'm actually being graded unfairly.

465
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,380
But I was wondering,
since you seem to be...

466
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,256
Well-versed.

467
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,968
Yeah. Well, I was hoping
maybe you could...

468
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:00,595
Help you.

469
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,847
- No, I don't need help.
- Oh, OK.

470
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:05,600
Just sounded like you were
asking me for help, that's all.

471
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,019
Forget it.

472
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,066
Yeah, OK, I need help.

473
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,944
Yes, I'll help you.
It's not a problem.

474
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:18,947
Only...

475
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,742
...I'm going to need some
help of my own first.

476
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,870
Pour the bleach like this:

477
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,499
And do not spill.

478
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,043
I bet you can't believe
I've never done laundry, can you?

479
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,963
Yeah, it's a real leap.

480
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,388
Cold.

481
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,558
Warm.

482
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,188
Cold, cold.

483
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:56,609
It's just so confusing. I mean, how do
you know what goes in which pile?

484
00:37:56,901 --> 00:38:00,780
It's a gift. I guess you could
say I'm the Rain Man of laundry.

485
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,492
OK, now it's my turn.

486
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:11,207
We did King Lear,
and now we're on the Sonnets.

487
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:14,753
Next, it's Hamlet, which is about
a whiny prince from Denmark.

488
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:17,839
- What does that have to do with reality?
- More than you think.

489
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,175
Well, you're from Denmark,
do you even have princes?

490
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:21,885
Yes, I think we do.

491
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,220
Well, Beth read it, and she said
he's a total loser.

492
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,307
Well, you can tell Beth that the prince
was young and scared,

493
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:30,393
and he didn't feel ready for
the hard choices he had to make.

494
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:33,313
It's not easy facing
that kind of pressure.

495
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,737
Right. Sonnets, you say.

496
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:51,081
O me!

497
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:54,376
What eyes hath love put in my head

498
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:58,171
Which have no correspondence
With true sight

499
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:01,800
Or if they have
Where is my Judgment fled

500
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:04,719
That censures falsely
What they see aright?

501
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,597
It's beautiful.

502
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:10,684
It's gibberish.
I have no idea what he's saying.

503
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,520
Well, he's saying
that love is magical,

504
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:16,356
and that it makes people look
at each other in an unspoiled way,

505
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:17,774
without judgment.

506
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,192
Why doesn't he just say that?

507
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:22,070
Why can't people just say
what they mean?

508
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:24,781
Well, people rarely say
what they mean.

509
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,826
That's the interesting part, is...

510
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:30,203
...is what's going on
underneath the surface.

511
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,957
See, take line 1 2.

512
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:38,420
The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears

513
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,005
What does that mean to you?

514
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:44,509
That the sun can't shine
when it's cloudy.

515
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:47,470
No. You're being too literal.
See, don't just go for the obvious.

516
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,056
See, all these words,
they have multiple meanings,

517
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:53,268
and you have
to explore the possibilities

518
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,520
and then make your choice.

519
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:59,232
See, like the word "sun",
that could mean the actual sun,

520
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:01,609
or it can mean light.

521
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:04,779
But then "light" can mean
knowledge or reason.

522
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,322
That could go on forever.

523
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,533
Yes. Yes, it could.

524
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:12,037
But I think in this case
it means reason.

525
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:15,707
And then "heaven" may refer
to the pearly gates,

526
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,626
or it could mean a state of being,
you know,

527
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:21,838
Iike being happy or in love.

528
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:29,387
So now read it again,
taking in all the possibilities,

529
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:31,973
and tell me what you think it means.

530
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:38,229
The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears

531
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:47,030
I guess it means
that love blinds you.

532
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:51,659
And when you're in love,
you can't think reasonably.

533
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:56,039
Do you agree?

534
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:58,249
Yeah.

535
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,714
I mean, it's just a poem.

536
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,843
Yeah. Yeah, it's just a poem.

537
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,762
Are you worried
a union work stoppage

538
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,181
will throw the country
into a recession?

539
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,183
That's something
we're striving to avoid.

540
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:17,769
- Mr. Prime Minister.
- Do you think being part of the EU

541
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,187
has been good for Denmark?

542
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:22,190
The United States of Europe
is a question of being strong together.

543
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:25,568
It's another boring photo opportunity
of an old guy walking down a carpet

544
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:28,029
answering the same questions
he answered last week.

545
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:29,656
- Where's Edvard?
- Now, you see,

546
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:32,492
he was always good for a big disaster
every few months or so.

547
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:34,619
I've got to find him.

548
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,168
Eddie. Hey.

549
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:45,797
Look.
It's my Shakespeare midterm.

550
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:48,174
A-minus.

551
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,760
That's brilliant.
That's really, really good.

552
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:52,220
- Well done.
- Thank you.

553
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,515
- Thank you, really, for helping me.
- It's OK.

554
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:58,810
I did even better on my chemistry.

555
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,480
It's good. That's really good.

556
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:06,443
- How'd you do?
- How did I do?

557
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:09,070
A minus...

558
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,948
-...three grades.
- D-minus.

559
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:14,993
- Yes, but it doesn't matter.
- Sure it does. You can do better.

560
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:16,911
I know you can.

561
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:23,543
And give up a brilliant career
in the food-service industry?

562
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:37,390
Hey, Eddie, do you have any plans
for Thanksgiving?

563
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:40,268
No, no. I'll be here.

564
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,191
Have a good vacation.

565
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,318
Yes, you too.

566
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:51,279
I can't believe you.
I can't believe you, Paige.

567
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:54,115
You should've invited him
home with you.

568
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:57,619
What? No. That would be so weird.

569
00:42:57,827 --> 00:43:01,831
Well, then you won't mind if I invite
him back to Milwaukee with me?

570
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,251
No. No, of course not.
Why would I mind?

571
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,045
I don't know.

572
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,299
Hey, Eddie, since you don't
have any other plans,

573
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:12,759
I was wondering if...

574
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:16,346
You wanted to spend Thanksgiving
with me and my family?

575
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:20,975
Yes, that'd be nice.

576
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,562
- Thank you.
- Sure.

577
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,610
I think I probably
should come with you, sir.

578
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,112
Oh, no, not this time.

579
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:34,406
The thing is, you see,
you'll be on your own.

580
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:37,826
- Yes, and I'll manage.
- All right. Later, dudes.

581
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:40,495
Actually, sir, it's my duty
to look out for you at all times.

582
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:42,414
- Soren, I'll be fine.
- With respect, sir,

583
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:46,668
- that's not for you to decide.
- Soren, yes, it is for me to decide.

584
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:51,798
What am I going to do here
for five days?

585
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:54,426
I don't know. Just sightsee, relax.

586
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:56,886
Soren, you'll be fine, OK?

587
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,860
- I'll pick you up Monday.
- Thanks again.

588
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:19,409
- Thank you.
- Hey.

589
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:22,120
Hiya, sweetie.
Oh, it's good to have you home.

590
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:24,164
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, kiddo.

591
00:44:24,372 --> 00:44:26,833
This is Eddie.
Eddie, this is my mom and dad.

592
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:30,045
Oh, we're so glad
that you could join us.

593
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:33,298
The only college friends of Paige's
we've ever met, they've all been girls.

594
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:35,884
- Thank you. I'm glad to be invited.
- Hi, I'm Ben Morgan.

595
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:37,302
Ben, hello.

596
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,888
Hey, hey, Doc Paige.

597
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,599
Farmer John Sausage.

598
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:45,810
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, Mike, you look great.

599
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,022
Oh, well, you know, Kayla's got me
on Slim-Fast, so I lost 15.

600
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,524
And he put five of it back on today
at Rocky Rococo's.

601
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,276
Boys.

602
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:56,821
Who's this guy?

603
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:59,532
This is Eddie. Eddie's an exchange
student from Denmark.

604
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,368
- He's just a friend.
- Hello.

605
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,288
- Welcome to our home.
- Thank you.

606
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,916
Mike, he speaks better English
than you do.

607
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,668
Yeah, anyway...

608
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:13,838
Pops, we'll see you in the morning.
Hey, we're watching you, Frenchy.

609
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,049
Come on into the house.

610
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,637
- You can ignore the moron twins.
- OK.

611
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,684
This is it.

612
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,355
- Oh, you can put them right here.
- Right.

613
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:31,981
Thanks.

614
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,468
What are all the pins for?

615
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,262
The few red ones
are where I've been,

616
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,514
and all the green ones
are where I want to go.

617
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:07,642
Ecuador, El Salvador.

618
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:11,688
They're not exactly
tourist destinations, are they?

619
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,357
No, but they're all the places
that Doctors Without Borders

620
00:46:14,524 --> 00:46:17,027
brings good medical care
and vaccinations

621
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:19,195
and clean drinking water. What?

622
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:21,239
Nothing.

623
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:24,659
I just really never met someone
who makes me feel so intimidated.

624
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,830
And believe me, I've met my fair share
of intimidating people.

625
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:31,416
I'm not intimidating. Look at me.

626
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:34,544
Yes, well, you see,
that's pretty intimidating, as well.

627
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:40,383
Well, I'm not the only one with goals.
What do you want to do?

628
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:45,096
I don't really have any choice.
I have to take over the family business.

629
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,600
- No choice at all?
- No.

630
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:51,061
Careful, you're crushing Gus.

631
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,813
Oh, Gus.

632
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,399
Yes, Gus.
He's a very good watch-moose.

633
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:58,693
Not once was I attacked
by a monster under my bed

634
00:46:58,943 --> 00:47:02,113
or something scary in the closet.
Isn't that right, Gus?

635
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,240
Yes, that's right.

636
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:05,784
Hello, Gus. Nice to meet you.

637
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:08,536
Very pleased to meet you, as well.

638
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:15,710
- I like you like this.
- Like what?

639
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:19,589
Don't know. Just like this.

640
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:21,633
Just Paige.

641
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:27,013
All right, Eddie, we got John's room
made up for you.

642
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:30,100
It's just down the hall
across from our room.

643
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:34,145
- We sleep with the door open.
- Thanks, Dad.

644
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:36,648
So, Eddie, would you like to see
how things work around here?

645
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:38,149
Maybe help us out tomorrow?

646
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:40,860
No, no, I don't think that's
such a good idea.

647
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,781
- Oh, why not?
- Yes, why not?

648
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:47,826
OK. You know what?
Go ahead and help out.

649
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,994
I'm gonna enjoy this.

650
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:52,706
Come on, let's get you settled in.

651
00:47:57,335 --> 00:48:00,338
Stop. Stop.

652
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:13,977
This one nearly hit me.

653
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:40,628
Haven't seen too many tractors, huh?

654
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:43,048
Nicely done with the milking.

655
00:48:43,256 --> 00:48:46,843
Yeah, I think you got a new best friend
in Bessy.

656
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,305
- Hey, should we get some dinner?
- What are those?

657
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:54,559
- They're lawn mowers.
- Lawn mowers. Really?

658
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:56,353
Yeah.

659
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,064
Hey, hey.

660
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:03,026
Actually, we race these.
It's a huge sport around here.

661
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:04,736
Really?

662
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:07,447
- Yeah.
- Do you mind if I have a look?

663
00:49:07,697 --> 00:49:09,491
No, be our guest.

664
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:12,160
Take a look at this one.
This is my baby.

665
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,912
Right.

666
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:26,174
- I just put a new flywheel in there.
- Yes, I see.

667
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,885
You know, no matter how dirty
he races, there's no way

668
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:31,805
we're letting Keith Kopetsky
take the trophy again this year.

669
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:35,225
- How fast do these things go?
- Well, we clocked it at 52.

670
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,562
I can make it faster.

671
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,774
- Yeah.
- OK. Come on. Let's go.

672
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:44,818
- What?
- That's good.

673
00:49:45,026 --> 00:49:48,363
Oh, you don't believe me?
I can.

674
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:54,703
- Might be a Thanksgiving pa, huh?
- Yeah.

675
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:56,204
Are you OK?

676
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:59,374
- Oh, you had me going.
- Not until after the pie, all right?

677
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,502
- Milk?
- Oh, no.

678
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,296
I won't be drinking much milk
in the near future.

679
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:08,925
- Ma, great turkey.
- Don't eat too much.

680
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:11,886
We got feeding to do, and I don't need
you boys in a turkey coma.

681
00:50:12,262 --> 00:50:14,222
- All right.
- You've got more work?

682
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:16,641
- Yeah, 24 hours a day.
- Really?

683
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,393
- Have to.
- If you don't milk them,

684
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:19,894
the cows' udders will explode.

685
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:24,524
- No.
- It happened at Frank Monahan's.

686
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:26,693
And did you actually
see it happen, Mikey?

687
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,278
- No.
- You're so bad.

688
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,156
You see, we gotta work twice as hard
as corporate-owned farms

689
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:32,615
just to stay afloat.

690
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:35,160
At this rate, the family farm
will be extinct in 20 years.

691
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:38,288
- I don't think he needs to hear it now.
- No, I'm interested.

692
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:41,666
What the big boys need to understand
is that we're all interdependent.

693
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:44,627
And if somebody loses,
eventually, we'll all lose.

694
00:50:47,213 --> 00:50:48,840
- What?
- Nothing.

695
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:52,510
- Thanks, Dad.
- So, Eddie,

696
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,180
- what's up with you and my sister?
- Johnny!

697
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,432
Look, Paige, someone had to ask.

698
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:59,476
Yeah, Paige, he's too good-looking.

699
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,770
- Yeah.
- That's right, you're too good-looking.

700
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,522
- I'm not that good-looking.
- He's pretty good-looking.

701
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,483
- You're pretty good-looking.
- Oh, yeah.

702
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:08,526
- Guys.
- If you combine that with the accent

703
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:10,779
and your Euro-charm,
you're a lethal combination.

704
00:51:10,945 --> 00:51:14,407
- Would everyone just stop? Please.
- Paige, we don't even know this guy.

705
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:17,827
I don't know anyone from Denmark.
I've never heard of anyone from there.

706
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:19,996
- Have you?
- Yeah, sure.

707
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:27,128
Eddie?

708
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:30,924
Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr,
Hans Christian Andersen.

709
00:51:31,966 --> 00:51:33,426
Wow.

710
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:35,220
Hans Christian Andersen?

711
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,221
Hans Christian Andersen?

712
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:38,890
Lars Ulrich.

713
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,475
- From Metallica?
- From Metallica.

714
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:42,519
- Get out.
- OK.

715
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:45,313
- And Helena Christensen.
- Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

716
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:47,023
- The Victoria's Secret model?
- Yes.

717
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:49,067
- OK.
- That's gotta be the coolest country

718
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:51,736
- in the world now.
- You should be a superpower.

719
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,030
Yes.

720
00:51:57,492 --> 00:52:00,161
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the Manitowoc County Fairgrounds.

721
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:02,330
A beautiful day for racing

722
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:05,959
and the 10th annual
Mad Mower Derby.

723
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,211
Give them a hand.
We got the seniors' class.

724
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,006
We've got machines
up to 1 5 horsepower.

725
00:52:11,172 --> 00:52:14,676
They'll be blasting by the grandstand
at a good eight to 12 miles an hour.

726
00:52:14,884 --> 00:52:17,429
So hang on to your hats
when they come by, folks.

727
00:52:17,637 --> 00:52:19,931
Let them hear it when they come
past the stands here.

728
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:24,352
Peterson's coming out of the pit.
Look at him go around that corner.

729
00:52:24,602 --> 00:52:26,813
- Come on. Come on.
- We've got a big deal today.

730
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:29,107
Check it out. Kopetsky.

731
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:40,702
What's up, Keith?

732
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:43,705
What the hell did you do
to that thing?

733
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:47,459
I bumped up the compression
and a few other little modifications.

734
00:52:56,217 --> 00:52:59,137
All right. One lap to go, folks.
Let them hear it now.

735
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:02,724
The last of the five laps here
in the senior class.

736
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:05,810
Osterhouse is pushing.
Now Peterson's moving up.

737
00:53:05,977 --> 00:53:08,188
He's making his move.
Here he comes now.

738
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:11,775
And here comes Thompson.
There goes Peterson!

739
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:14,194
Go, Mr. Peterson.

740
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:16,905
- That's Mr. Peterson?
- He's so damn old.

741
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:19,074
What a good, clean race
we had for the seniors.

742
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:25,246
- Your brothers seem to like him.
- Mom.

743
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:28,541
- I like him too.
- Yeah, I get that.

744
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:32,587
I really can't afford
any distractions right now.

745
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:35,590
Chemistry isn't just in a class, kiddo.

746
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,928
- And you guys have it.
- Right.

747
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:42,972
Then what happens? I fool myself
into thinking he's Prince Charming?

748
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:45,767
We get married
and live happily ever after?

749
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:47,394
Then all my work
goes down the drain

750
00:53:47,602 --> 00:53:49,854
because I'm too busy
shopping for groceries

751
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,440
and picking my kids up at soccer.

752
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:54,984
Sweetie,

753
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:57,487
it really wasn't as bad as all that.

754
00:53:57,904 --> 00:54:00,907
- I didn't mean it that way.
- I know.

755
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:04,077
But we're not talking about me.

756
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,871
I made my choice.

757
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:10,166
This is about you making
the right choice for you.

758
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:13,837
OK, we're getting ready
for the super-modified class.

759
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:16,631
OK, your brothers
are getting out there.

760
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,717
We have a Le Mans-style start.

761
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,095
The engines will be off.
The drivers, on the gun,

762
00:54:22,303 --> 00:54:24,389
will be running on foot
across the track,

763
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:25,849
- Go, Eddie.
- onto the mowers,

764
00:54:26,057 --> 00:54:28,518
start the mowers and start racing.

765
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:31,688
All right, this one's for all the marbles.

766
00:54:32,605 --> 00:54:34,899
And they've set themselves up
on the line now.

767
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:37,027
Boys, you've been waiting
all summer for this.

768
00:54:37,193 --> 00:54:39,738
They're getting ready here.
They're champing at the bit, folks.

769
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:44,451
All set. Listen for the gun
to start it off.

770
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:48,163
- Shut up.
- And they're off. There they go.

771
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:50,248
- Oh, Williams and Kopetsky collide.
- Get up.

772
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:53,460
Williams is on the ground. Get out
of there before they run you over.

773
00:54:53,668 --> 00:54:56,129
They're firing the machines up now.
Number five is up.

774
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:58,715
Number seven's up.
Kopetsky pulls right out.

775
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:03,511
Looks like Williams is having trouble
getting his engine going.

776
00:55:04,095 --> 00:55:05,680
And as they head
into the first turn,

777
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:08,350
Kopetsky on number eight
is in the lead.

778
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:13,980
Look at that.
Williams got it running.

779
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:17,525
But he's got a long way to go.
