1
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,040
Ladies and gentlemen..

2
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,374
That medal will be awarded now...

3
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:08,457
...which every police officer
desires to wear on his chest.

4
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:13,207
This medal is awarded
every year to that officer...

5
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,999
...who not only does his duty...

6
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:24,749
...but who goes beyond that,
and safeguards the law itself.

7
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:31,040
This year that medal is awarded to our
upcoming, outstanding officer...

8
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,665
...sub-lnspector Ravi Verma.

9
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:45,624
Honourable Minister,
my senior officers, and friends.

10
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,624
What l'm about to say,
is nothing really new.

11
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,707
The awardee always states
"l don't deserve this honour".

12
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,665
lt's a different matter of course,
that they don't really mean it.

13
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,290
But in fact, it's the truth.

14
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:07,665
The world honours and respects
the man behind every achievement.

15
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,582
But behind that man
there are others too...

16
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,374
...who go unnoticed,
and not known by people.

17
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,707
Whose name is not printed
in any book, paper or gazette.

18
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,999
Before accepting this medal, l want
to name the person behind my feat.

19
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,874
That person is Sumitradevi.

20
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:38,040
Who, fortunately, happens to be...
...my mother.

21
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:51,499
The feat for which l'm being feted
is no doubt, done by these hands.

22
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,582
But the strength
in them was my mother's!

23
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:04,040
That's why l'd like my mother
be allowed to accept this medal.

24
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,957
Come, Madam... Let me take you...

25
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:58,249
"Long live Anandbabu."

26
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,207
Today is the 1 1th
day of our strike.

27
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:09,374
But it seems,
that our stone-deaf owners...

28
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,624
...haven't yet understood
what we are demanding.

29
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,332
They think we want to
deprive them of their wealth.

30
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:22,832
Not true. They think we
wish to be rich like them...

31
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,874
...and make them poor like us.
This is also not true.

32
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,082
We just want to point
out that the labourer...

33
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:37,457
...who extracts coal from the mines
searches for fuel for his own hearth.

34
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,207
And we also demand,
that the dark nights...

35
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:47,999
...that have clouded our lives,
for all these years now...

36
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,040
...be done and over with,
and let a new morn dawn!

37
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,832
- Long live!
- Mr. Anand!

38
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,874
And that morning
will dawn on that day...

39
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,665
...when the workers get the right
and a proper share for their efforts.

40
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:06,082
A hospital to treat them, and
a good school for their children.

41
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:12,249
lf my voice is reaching
the owners of these mines...

42
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,290
...then let them listen.
We're not complaining about...

43
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:20,124
...why are the vases in
their rooms full of fresh flowers.

44
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:25,040
We are complaining why are
our tins in the kitchens empty?

45
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,124
We're not complaining
why these coal mines...

46
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:34,332
...yield gold for them.
We're complaining...

47
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:40,665
...why do we get just brass?
lf, at this moment my voice...

48
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,540
...is reaching their ears,
then let them hear.

49
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,249
That this strike
will not be over...

50
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,457
...as long as there's
strength in us.

51
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,290
"Long live Anandbabu."

52
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,290
- He's a good orator.
- Shall l shut him up?

53
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:17,207
No. Don't ever make that mistake.

54
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:23,249
lf a leader dies an untimely death,
he becomes a martyr forever.

55
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,707
- His long life is his death.
- Then what do we do?

56
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,749
He can't be bribed either.

57
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,082
lf not by money, something else.

58
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:38,749
Every man has his weaknesses.
One weak point...

59
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:44,332
Put a finger on that and he's ready
to sell off all his principles.

60
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:50,832
But the point is...
what is Anandbabu's weak point?

61
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,915
Aren't the boys back
from school as yet?

62
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,957
They'll be here, you get
so upset if they're slightly late!

63
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,040
Brother stop.

64
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,124
Here they are.

65
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,165
Brother stop. Brother stop.

66
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,290
Mom!

67
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:28,707
- Come here, where were you?
- ln school.

68
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,457
Come, come. Sit. Good boy.

69
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:38,040
- How was school today?
- Our teacher said...

70
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,665
- He said something about you.
- Really? What did he say?

71
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:46,124
- He said, 'your father... '
- No, no. He said, Anandbabu.

72
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:50,999
- Yes, that you are a man of principles."
- Yes, father.

73
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:56,624
- ls that true? - Can't say son.
- Run along. l've made 'kheer' today.

74
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,082
Come on, go.

75
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:03,874
You should see their pranks! Either
they read the paper like you.

76
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:08,915
Or they'll stand on the chain and lecture!
You mean the world to them.

77
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,540
And who else do l have
in this world except them?

78
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,790
- Did anyone give pamphlets?
- Yes he did.

79
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,999
He was saying the same thing. That
you're the only hope they have.

80
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,415
Yes. Tomorrow we're going to protest
in front of the owner's bungalow.

81
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,957
Let's see what happens.

82
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:35,749
Agree to our demands.
Give us our rights.

83
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,582
Please gentlemen... the owners
are ready to discuss things.

84
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:58,040
Send your representative
who'll talk on your behalf.

85
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,665
Come in.

86
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,499
- Greetings, sir.
- Sit down.

87
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,499
l've all the papers ready
for a compromise between us.

88
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,165
You made them ready,
before talking to the labourers?

89
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,040
Read the papers first,
and then sign.

90
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,332
Did you call me in,
to play this practical joke on me?

91
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,374
l've already refused to
sign whatever's written in this.

92
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:09,665
You haven't seen the full file yet.
Turn another page and see.

93
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,207
Sir..

94
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:22,082
l'm a businessman.
l also don't like such gimmicks.

95
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,207
But sometimes people like you,
force me to do them.

96
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:31,665
- Where is my family?
- Wherever they are, they are fine.

97
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,290
Do you realize, sir, that
you are committing a serious crime?

98
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,999
You can stop me from committing it.

99
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:48,957
Sign these papers, and tomorrow your
family will return to you safely.

100
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,790
And if l refuse to sign?

101
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:03,040
Nothing much. l'll just
tear this photograph into pieces.

102
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,207
Are you threatening me?

103
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:14,582
You don't know this man.
His name is Bachchan Singh.

104
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,624
He has gone to jail twice.
That too for murder!

105
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:25,124
- Once for throttling a kid of 7...
- Listen, sir...

106
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,290
- l'm listening.
- l...

107
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,707
- l want my family.
- And l want your signature.

108
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,915
l've signed the papers
concerning our demands.

109
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:03,790
- l've agreed to all the conditions.
- What do you mean by that?

110
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:09,332
l've agreed that we'll
all toil on the same pay scale.

111
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:14,457
l've also accepted that henceforth,
if we go on a strike...

112
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,915
...it'll be illegal.

113
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,957
l've... l've sold you all to them.

114
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,457
Get down, all of you.
lf you utter a word about this...

115
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,999
...you and your kids will
meet the same fate as your husband.

116
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:21,874
l know. l know why you did it.

117
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:27,957
You did it for me,
and for your children.

118
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,415
You were helpless...

119
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,207
Anandbabu is a thief.

120
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:49,290
lt's on everyone's lip
that Anandbabu is a thief.

121
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,832
Just some naughty boys.

122
00:16:56,166 --> 00:17:01,290
You'll see, people will
soon forget and forgive you.

123
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,915
You'll soon gain their
respect like before.

124
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,415
Honestly, they'll all respect you.

125
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,957
Get these medicines, will you?

126
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,915
Don't look so worried.
lt'll be fine.

127
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,165
l'll go and get the medicines.

128
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,040
Anandbabu is a fraud.

129
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,957
Look! There goes the
wife of our owner's pimp.

130
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,915
- He really got beaten up!
- So? Must have made lolly too.

131
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,957
ln dealing with coals,
only the hand gets blackened.

132
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:52,040
- His whole face got blackened.
- He's a bloody fraud.

133
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,624
He's a bloody fraud.

134
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,540
No! Oh No...

135
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,957
Tattoo my darling's name on my arm,
will you?

136
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:27,582
Better think. For, once l tattoo,
it'll never come off!

137
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,040
Look there goes that boy...

138
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,915
What's your name?

139
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:42,040
- This is Anandbabu's son.
- Oh, l see.

140
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,915
So this is the offspring
of that cheat, eh?

141
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,999
- What's your name?
- Vijay.

142
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,499
And your father's name?

143
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:52,832
Mr. Anand.

144
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,832
Say "Thief"...

145
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,040
You say, what you tattoo
cannot be erased, eh?

146
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:18,332
- Then tattoo on his arm.
- What? - "My father is a thief."

147
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:35,499
What happened, son?
Who beat you up?

148
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,999
Tell me, son. Why don't you speak?

149
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,165
"My father is a thief."

150
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,915
Vijay... my son!

151
00:19:55,708 --> 00:20:00,457
We won't stay here now.
They are all against us.

152
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,499
We'll go away from here.
We'll go away!

153
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:23,082
How will we live here?
How will we eat?

154
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,165
l'm here... Your mother.

155
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,582
Careful, my dear...

156
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,582
- Vijay!
- What happened, mom?

157
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,582
Where's Ravi? He was here now.

158
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,249
Must be here somewhere. l'll see.

159
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:03,749
"The best place in
this world is our lndia."

160
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:05,665
There he is, Mother.

161
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:11,749
"Our lndia!"

162
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,749
Why are you crying?

163
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,957
Then what shall l do?

164
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:23,249
l can't earn enough even
to send you both to school.

165
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,040
You don't earn enough
to educate us both, but...

166
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:37,582
...we both can earn enough to
send Ravi to school. l'll earn too.

167
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,790
My son!

168
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,999
But you're just a kid.
What work will you do?

169
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,290
Give me two race book.

170
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:31,124
- And the 2nd race?
- ln the 2nd race...

171
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,915
Royal Salute to Halla Gulla.

172
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:37,040
l see. We have a good chance there.

173
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:45,915
- And the 6th race? - "Manga".
- Okay, but not for a long distance.

174
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:51,040
- Meaning? - A horse which runs
slow at first, is for a long race.

175
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,165
- Once he speeds up, he leaves
everyone else behind. - Done, sir.

176
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,665
Pay him.

177
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:06,082
l polish shoes. l don't beg. Pick
up that coin and hand it to me.

178
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:11,415
- Hear that, sir?
- Yes.

179
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,582
Give him the money.

180
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,374
- What!
- Yes, give it to him.

181
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,457
Jaichand..

182
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,124
That is a long-distance runner!

183
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,499
Did you see his arrogance?
He won't shine shoes all his life.

184
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:41,957
The day he picks up speed in life,
he'll leave everyone behind.

185
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,624
Mark my words.
This boy will come up in life.

186
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:52,832
He will make a name for himself.
He gets the highest marks in class.

187
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,915
Well done! Now go to your place.

188
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:57,082
Thank you, teacher.

189
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,457
Come on children. Open your books.

190
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:10,165
Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up!

191
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:17,790
Are you blind? Do you own these
bricks to break them like this?

192
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:22,082
- Sorry, sir. - Sorry, my foot!
She's so delicate she can't work!

193
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,040
Then go and do something
you are capable of!

194
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,332
Mind your tongue!

195
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:34,624
Look at that. lt's a sin
even to show pity these days.

196
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:39,707
She had literally begged for work.
Now, she's drunk. How can she work?

197
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:43,374
- Get lost from here.
- l've 2 small kids. Have mercy.

198
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,999
l've seen many like you,
who hire kids, and beg around!

199
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,165
Now get lost! Go on...

200
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:58,915
She broke new bricks.
l've to give accounts to the boss.

201
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,540
She's up in front for money,
and when it comes to work, she's...

202
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:10,207
Blood! Whose kid is that?
Catch him!

203
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,499
Why did he swear at you?

204
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,832
The poor have to bear everything.

205
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:31,374
lf tomorrow l find some other
work will l be given privileges?

206
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,415
Nothing will change with
you throwing a stone, son.

207
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,249
What is written in one's destiny,
nobody can erase.

208
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:47,749
Look at me. See how l bear
all the nasty remarks silently.

209
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:53,415
Ravi is your brother
but you both are so different.

210
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,332
Yes, that's true.
We're poles apart.

211
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,040
And the biggest difference...
...is this!

212
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:25,915
Mom!

213
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:31,665
- l won't go in the temple.
- What nonsense are you talking?

214
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,999
l don't want anything from God.
l'm not going in!

215
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:40,707
lf you don't go in, l'll never
speak to you, nor give you food.

216
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,665
Excuse me, but don't
force him to go in the temple.

217
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:50,165
For one prays with faith, not
force. The day his faith awakens...

218
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,457
...he'll walk in, on his own.
Now go in and pray.

219
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,790
Come, Ravi.

220
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:51,999
Tell me, Mom, what do you
ask from God when you come here?

221
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:56,957
Shall l tell you? Joy for you,
and peace for your brother.

222
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:02,790
Either you don't talk
to Him seriously, or...

223
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,624
He doesn't take you seriously.
That's why l don't get a job.

224
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,832
May be He's on the look
out for a good job for you.

225
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:16,624
So that's how it is!
Listen, be sure to tell Him...

226
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:21,040
...that l won't mind even if it
pays me Rs. 250 or so, - Nonsense!

227
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:27,499
l fool around a bit. Else, l don't
have a grudge against God like him!

228
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,499
lt's been years now, but he...
Why don't you talk to him?

229
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:39,582
Mom... you just see that
he doesn't enter the Temple.

230
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:43,040
But you don't notice that he
sits on its steps, daily for you.

231
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:53,415
Finished your prayers?
Let's go. l've to go.

232
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,624
Here, have this,

233
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:57,832
- Take it.
- Here we go again.

234
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:01,999
She's giving it to you as a Holy
offering. You eat it as a treat.

235
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,999
You both will be happy that way.
Give it to him...

236
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,374
Good.

237
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:11,082
Me too. Look Mom, l'm the one who's
getting fat eating this daily.

238
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:16,040
Even then l'm without a job!
l'll go to the Employment Exchange.

239
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,832
lf l'm late, l won't get a job.
Bye, Mom; see you, brother.

240
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,332
How are you?

241
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:01,415
Fine, son. Till the new
truck comes, we'll use this.

242
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:02,790
Careful there...

243
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,499
A new boy... He'll learn by and by.

244
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,790
Yes.

245
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:23,040
Every day l mean to ask you,
but l forget. About your badge.

246
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:28,207
- My badge?
- Yes. What's the number?

247
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:33,624
- 786.
- Right. 786.

248
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:39,665
ln Muslims this is a good omen.
Like Hindus have 'OM'.

249
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,124
- What does "786" mean?
- lt means "Bismillah."

250
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,040
"l start in the name of
God" lt's an auspicious omen, son.

251
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:54,290
lt'll bring prosperity.
keep it on you always.

252
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,415
Take this load, will you?

253
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,957
Gangu!

254
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,332
- Hello, uncle.
- Call me uncle, eh?

255
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:04,207
Not this way, son.
Like this. Understand?

256
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,290
l was also of his age.
When l became a porter.

257
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:17,249
How long have you been here? You
must have seen a lot of changes.

258
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:22,040
Nothing has changed! l carried load
before, today also, it's the same.

259
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:26,374
We had to pay the local ruffians
some money, to earn a living.

260
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:31,457
Today, too, l pay them.
People say, times have changed.

261
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:37,082
May be. l've just seen
the people who extort us change!

262
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,624
Greetings, sir.

263
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,249
So, Peter?
How's everything? Well, l hope.

264
00:32:55,333 --> 00:33:01,040
Of course, sir! Will anyone
dare not to give money to my men?

265
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:04,582
Today, it's pay-day
for these porters here, sir.

266
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,457
Money will reach your office.

267
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,665
- Give it to Rana.
- Yes, sir.

268
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,165
He'll give you your share.
Here's some as pocket money.

269
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,999
Thank you, sir!

270
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:29,457
What's all this, uncle?
Why are they taking money from us?

271
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:32,707
- This is our 'bail' for being poor.
- What?

272
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:36,749
You're new here, but you'll learn.

273
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:42,040
They are a local hooligan's men.
He takes Rs. 2 from us all.

274
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:45,457
- But why do they take it?
- Why?

275
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:51,082
Nobody has dared to ask till now.
You also don't question them.

276
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,957
- Just pay your Rs. 2/-, and go.
- No!

277
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,374
Why should l give?
No, l won't pay them.

278
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:02,957
Have l come here to earn for them?
l've to send a M.O. Home.

279
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,707
My mother, and 2 sisters live
there. lf l send money from now...

280
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:11,624
...then only we can collect a dowry
for them. Else, how will they marry?

281
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:15,499
No! And you ask me to pay them.

282
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,624
Why should l give them?
l won't give.

283
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,374
Come on...

284
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:30,707
- What are you staring at?
Put your money in this. - No!

285
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:36,499
- What? You won't give, eh?
- He's a new boy. He'll learn.

286
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,707
- Come on, son, pay up.
- No! Why should l pay him?

287
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:45,207
- You damn fool!
- He's taking my money.

288
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,332
Help me somebody.
lt's my mother's money he's taking.

289
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,832
He died in route to the hospital.
And what for? Forjust...

290
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:41,040
- Forjust Rs. 2/-?
- Why didn't he pay? We all do.

291
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:45,249
ln this world, the poor
have to hear a lot and exist.

292
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,957
And these are hooligans.
Who'll question them?

293
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,124
You're right. Absolutely right.

294
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,832
l'm around 25 years now. l've
not seen anyone refusing to pay.

295
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:07,124
Uncle, what didn't happen
in 25 years, will happen now!

296
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:13,207
Another porter will refuse
to part with his money next week!

297
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,749
Your name?

298
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,124
Name?

299
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,915
- Ravi.
- Ravi what?

300
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,207
Ravi Verma.

301
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,124
Education?

302
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:39,499
- You can say l'm a graduate.
- What do you mean by that?

303
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,832
l mean, l'm B.A.

304
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:48,165
- Your height?
- 5 feet. 9, 10 or 1 1 inches!

305
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,374
- What's this 9, 10 or 1 1 inches?
- 5 ft 10 inches!

306
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:57,332
That's the trouble. You get nervous.
lf you're like this with me...

307
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,082
...how will you fare there?
You didn't answer me confidently.

308
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,874
You get so jittery.

309
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,749
You are right. l get nervous...

310
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,624
...and then l talk all rot,
and people think l know nothing!

311
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:11,540
But never mind.

312
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:15,457
This time l'll be so
prepared that l'll stun them!

313
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:20,790
l'll look into my
interviewer's eyes...

314
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,832
...and say...
- What will you say?

315
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,374
My name is Ravi Verma.

316
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:28,957
- Your education?
- l'm B.A. And my height is 5' 10"!

317
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,832
l didn't ask you your height.

318
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,290
Oh, sorry sir.

319
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,124
lf you have your certificates...

320
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,749
..let me have a look at them.
- Here you are, sir.

321
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:43,707
Good. Very good.

322
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:45,665
Sports.

323
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,499
Excellent!

324
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,832
'So you possess these qualities
also along with education.'

325
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,415
We wanted a smart man
like you for this job.

326
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:59,040
Then, shall l think
that l'll get this job?

327
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,082
Excuse me.

328
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,082
Hello!

329
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,040
Good morning, sir. Good morning.

330
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:09,832
Speaking, sir.
Yes, you had mentioned it.

331
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,540
Yes, l've met him.
On your son's birthday...

332
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:18,707
...you had invited me, too.
l had met him there.

333
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,124
Of course it'll be done.
Right, sir.

334
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,832
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

335
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,624
That was the G.M. On the line.

336
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,249
- About that job, sir.
- Job?

337
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:40,165
Mr. Ravi...

338
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,957
That job has been
given to somebody else.

339
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:50,665
Given to somebody else?
But you just said...

340
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:57,374
Yes, l know, but l just
spoke to my G.M., you see.

341
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:00,082
His brother-in-law...

342
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,499
You see he is deserving...

343
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,707
- You see.
- Yes, sir.

344
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,790
l can see.

345
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,957
Look, don't take it very badly.

346
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:12,874
No, sir.

347
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:18,249
How can l take it badly?
lt's me, who's bad.

348
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:22,374
l have a degree,
plus other certificates.

349
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,332
But l don't have a
letter of recommendation!

350
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:27,457
Thank you, sir.

351
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,207
Next.

352
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,749
Thank you.

353
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,082
Listen.

354
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,290
- Have you come here for an
interview too? - Yes.

355
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:42,040
- Do you have any relative as a G.M.,
or a Director here? - No.

356
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,457
Then you won't get a job here.

357
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,957
You wasting time here.

358
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:48,290
Better go home.

359
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,749
Oh come on, Ravi!

360
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:58,165
- This wasn't the last job on earth!
- l won't even get that!

361
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:03,749
Look, my dear.
lt was fine till college.

362
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:08,915
We were in the same class, attended
same lectures, and had tea together.

363
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:13,374
But this world is not our college.
lt's a chest of drawers, a cupboard.

364
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:18,040
- lt has different compartments.
And you... - Daughter of D.C. P...

365
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:22,665
...is right in the top drawer,
and you are at the bottom! Right?

366
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:28,290
Yes! And why do you waste your
time with me? What's your gain?

367
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:37,374
l wished for you
and l have got you.

368
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,332
You wished for me,
and you have got me.

369
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:49,082
And now!
Whatever we get! Or we don't.

370
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:51,832
We don't have any regrets.

371
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:56,582
l wished for you
and l have got you.

372
00:40:56,875 --> 00:41:01,540
You wished for me,
and you have got me.

373
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,165
Not only is the
cool shade but also..

374
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:19,124
..the hot sunshine
is present on the way.

375
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,582
Whether there is
sorrow or happiness..

376
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:28,457
..we have to accept
everything with open arms.

377
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:31,999
Not only is the
cool shade but also..

378
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:38,207
..the hot sunshine
is present on the way.

379
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,457
Whether there is
sorrow or happiness..

380
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,249
..we have to accept
everything with open arms.

381
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:57,790
O unhappy man living in this world,
don't you know this?'

382
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,415
l wished for you
and l have got you.

383
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,082
You wished for me,
and you have got me.

384
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:15,457
lf you are so stubborn
then l will never complain again.

385
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:24,707
l will tolerate all
the sorrows with a smile.

386
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,374
lf you are so stubborn
then l will never complain again.

387
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:43,624
l will tolerate all
the sorrows with a smile.

388
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:54,082
Something that hurts you, l
have never done anything like that.

389
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:58,624
l wished for you
and l have got you.

390
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:03,665
You wished for me,
and you have got me.

391
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,332
- And now.
- And now.

392
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,665
- Whatever we get.
- Whatever we get.

393
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:10,999
- Or we don't!
- Or we don't!

394
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:12,749
We don't have any regrets.

395
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:17,999
l wished for you
and l have got you.

396
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:22,040
You wished for me,
and you have got me.

397
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:27,415
l wished for you
and l have got you.

398
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,957
You wished for me,
and you have got me.

399
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:42,332
Where are you going?
Put your money in there.

400
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,415
What are you looking at?
Out with your money!

401
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,749
Are you drunk or something?

402
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:04,332
That porter has the
guts to hit my man?

403
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:11,040
Today one man refused to pay.
Tomorrow two, and so on.

404
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,874
You all go and get
that bastard right here!

405
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:18,707
And beat the hell out of him.
Go now!

406
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,040
- Seen Vijay?
- No. l know nothing.

407
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,332
- Where is he?
- Don't know.

408
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,749
- You're here?
- Why?

409
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:45,207
Peter's men are looking for you.

410
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,540
- Where are you going?
- Outside on the road. - What for?

411
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:54,165
Go out from the back, son.

412
00:44:56,625 --> 00:45:01,124
- Does the road belong to Peter?
- l won't hear of it!

413
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:05,040
Listen, you call me 'Uncle', right?

414
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:11,124
- Son, please go from this side.
- Alright.

415
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:25,582
- We didn't find him anywhere.
- l think he has run away.

416
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:31,374
- He won't be back!
- Where will he go? We'll get him.

417
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,415
Don't spare him. kill him!

418
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:34,790
Peter!

419
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,290
Stop!

420
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:42,874
Good you came yourself.
l was looking for you.

421
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:48,249
You were looking for me, and l...
was waiting for you here.

422
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,915
So that's how it is.

423
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:15,082
keep these in your pocket.

424
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:19,915
l'll open this lock, only when
l take these keys from your pocket.

425
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:21,915
Here.

426
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:32,707
Catch! Catch him! Beat him up!

427
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,540
Beat him!

428
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,999
Break the bastard's legs!

429
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:06,915
Get up!

430
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,749
You'll open the lock, eh?

431
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,332
You bastard! l'll open that lock.

432
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:55,665
keep the keys back in your pocket.

433
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,124
keep them!

434
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:53,832
Long live, Vijay!

435
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:18,207
Why did you have to fight them?
There are other workers too.

436
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:23,332
Were you the "chosen-one"?
You didn't think that...

437
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:29,082
...if something happened to you,
what will l do? Those hooligans...

438
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:31,582
...they draw knives for nothing.

439
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:33,582
Oh Mom! lt's done now.

440
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:39,332
Shut up! You're lecturing me?
lf you're so clever...

441
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:44,374
...then share that with him
who doesn't even let me die calmly!

442
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,624
When you knew they were after you,
why did you go and face them?

443
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:52,332
Couldn't you have sneaked out?

444
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,915
You wanted me to run like a coward?

445
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:03,832
What was that? What did you say?

446
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,707
- What did you say?
- Mom!

447
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,040
- Let me go!
- No, mom.

448
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,332
What does he mean by that?

449
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:18,415
Whatever he did, was for us.

450
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:24,749
For all of us!
So that we'd be alive.

451
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:26,790
We would live!

452
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:33,665
Manager, it's 1 1 o'clock.
That boy still hasn't come.

453
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:37,457
- What do you think?
Shall we give him a chance? - Sure.

454
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:44,124
Look, we had decided on a salesman
but l think, the job was yours.

455
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:49,707
- Then do l get this job?
- You speak English well, don't you?

456
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:54,040
- Yes, l suppose so.
- Then start from today.

457
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:56,582
- Explain his work to him.
- Yes, sir.

458
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:58,415
Thank you very much, sir.

459
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:05,874
- Excuse me, but l'm a bit late.
- Not "bit", but a lot!

460
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:09,957
l thought you won't come,
so l gave him the job. Right?

461
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,957
Yes, sir.

462
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,374
Don't do that. l'm really hard up.

463
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:18,832
Actually, l didn't have
money even for the bus-fare today.

464
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:24,582
- l got late because l walked.
- Okay, but we've employed him.

465
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:29,374
- But you didn't tell me how
much l'll get, sir. - Rs. 350/-

466
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:34,832
What! l'd have got a job ages ago
if l had accepted such petty pay.

467
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,790
- Then did you expect Rs. 3,500/-?
- No, but even then... Never mind.

468
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:44,707
- l don't want yourjob!
- Give him the job.

469
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:52,749
l say, sir. l'm...

470
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:57,540
- Congrats!
- l'm... what can l say, sir?

471
00:53:57,666 --> 00:54:01,957
lt's okay. This world has become
a 3rd class compartment of a train.

472
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:05,082
Less space, more passengers.

473
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,915
lf l'd have sat, you'd have stood!

474
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,374
- All the best.
- Thank you.

475
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:36,665
Haven't you slept as yet, son?

476
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,582
- Go and sleep, Mom.
- What's this you're writing?

477
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:45,624
Whenever there are vacancies,
l'm sending applications.

478
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:51,832
lt's very late. Go and sleep.
Look, it's nearly dawn.

479
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:57,249
lt's not dawn as yet.
The day will dawn...

480
00:54:57,291 --> 00:55:00,957
...when everyone will have a home,
a job, and nobody will be poor.

481
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:05,374
And the day will dawn when
the labourers get their right...

482
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:08,374
And when that day dawns... Oh God!

483
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,957
That's the trouble with reading.
A layman becomes an orator.

484
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,040
Okay, go to sleep now.

485
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:48,999
Nowadays train travel
has become a nuisance!

486
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:55,040
l say, sir. Where are you going?
l'm asking you, sir.

487
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:56,415
Where are you going?

488
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:00,415
Nowhere.

489
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,124
Hey you! Yes, you.

490
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,790
Boss wants you.

491
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:36,874
ls your name Vijay?

492
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,332
Yes.

493
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:45,332
- Did you thrash Samant's men
in their own house? - Who's Samant?

494
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:50,540
ln whose safe goes the money
extorted from the dock-hands.

495
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:57,290
Samant's my enemy too. lf you wish,
we can help each other.

496
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:58,624
How?

497
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,707
Get in.

498
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:03,915
Get in. Don't be scared.

499
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:18,790
- Look upon me as a friend.
- Friends have names too.

500
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:23,540
My name is Davar.
Start the car, driver.

501
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:39,790
Besides extorting money from
dock-hands and mill-workers...

502
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,165
Samant and his men have
fingers in other pies too!

503
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:47,707
Like liquor-dens;
gambling-dens, smuggling...

504
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,790
...and looting other smugglers.

505
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,624
That's where you become foes!

506
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:03,374
My gold comes from Dubai.
l don't know how he comes to know.

507
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:07,415
Samant and his men
have thrice stolen my gold.

508
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:15,749
l need such a man, who, after
the gold is unloaded, till it...

509
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,582
...reaches the godown, protects
it from the police and Samant.

510
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,165
Vijay.

511
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:43,207
l need you. And l can
take care of all your needs.

512
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,915
Do you agree?
What are you looking at?

513
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:51,874
l'm looking at the pavement there.

514
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:58,415
A helpless woman,
with 2 innocent kids.

515
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:03,415
Weak with hunger. And homeless.

516
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:09,124
l accept your deal, sir.

517
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:10,540
Good.

518
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:18,582
Today is your first day
at your new job. Here, keep this.

519
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,332
Sir, many years ago,
you attended the races.

520
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:30,499
And parked your car at a certain
place and had your shoes polished.

521
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,624
Yes, why?

522
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:35,832
l don't pick up money thrown at me,
even today!

523
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:42,665
Oh, l'm sorry.

524
00:59:56,333 --> 01:00:00,582
keep this file and cap on the table
and don't forget that brief-case.

525
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:01,790
Hi, Veera!

526
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:03,582
Hi, dad.

527
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,124
Hello, sir.

528
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:09,165
- Hi, young man.
- We're caught now.

529
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:13,124
Where were you, Ravi?
What are you doing these days?

530
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:18,832
Why hide it from you, sir?
l'm nowhere these days.

531
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:24,374
- Nowhere? Then join the police.
- Police force? Me?

532
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:30,207
l'm not joking. We need
young educated men like you.

533
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:34,915
- Didn't you see the advert?
- You think he can become an officer?

534
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:39,332
Of course! But don't expect
me to put in a good word for you.

535
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:43,790
You won't? Then l'll send
an application tomorrow itself!

536
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:45,040
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

537
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,915
Make me a cup of tea too, dear.
l'll change and come. Sit down, son.

538
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,082
Thank you, sir.

539
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:52,540
So! You'll be a police officer too.

540
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,749
Yes.

541
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:58,415
ln my last birth l must have been a dacoit!
My father's in the police...

542
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:02,582
...and now you!
Why is the police after me?

543
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:10,457
A shipment of gold will reach
Versova beach exactly at 1 1 p.m.

544
01:01:11,166 --> 01:01:15,624
You'll all be there.
Vijay and Darpan kumar...

545
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,915
...will be at a distance,
keeping a look out on all sides.

546
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:23,790
As soon as the steamer comes,
Jaichand will go to those people...

547
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:28,790
...and show this torn
piece of a note to them.

548
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:34,749
The other half of this note will be
with them. They'll join the pieces.

549
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,124
And give the gold to Jaichand.

550
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:43,332
Sir... l want to say something.
The job that you've hired me for...

551
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,165
...how to go about it,
is also my job.

552
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:49,124
l don't get you.

553
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,040
You want gold.
lt'll reach you safely.

554
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:57,999
But there's a condition to it.
Leave this job safely to me.

555
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:01,624
- You want to do this job alone?
- Yes, sir.

556
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,957
You think you can
do it on your own?

557
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,332
No, sir.

558
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:12,374
l know l can do it alone.

559
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,207
Okay.

560
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:23,582
l'll try my luck with you.
You'll do this job alone.

561
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,207
Take this piece of note.
But remember...

562
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:31,624
The police will be
after you and also, Samant!

563
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,457
Only my luck will back me, sir.

564
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:29,749
You won't need that.
l want to talk business with him.

565
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:34,790
You want to talk business
by stopping the lift like this?

566
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:38,915
l'm told that the walls of a lift,
don't have ears!

567
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:44,457
Sir, if l tell you when,
and where...

568
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:49,582
...Mr. Davar's gold is to land,
how much will you give me?

569
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:54,999
lf this is a joke,
you won't live to enjoy it!

570
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,290
lf you take it as a joke,
then you'll live to cry later on.

571
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:04,332
The gold is worth 5,00,000/-!

572
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,874
How do you know all this?

573
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,415
You just eat the fruit.

574
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:19,332
Why bother about the trees?
Tell me, what will be my share?

575
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:23,582
5,00,000/- But only
after l get the gold.

576
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:28,124
Okay. Send your men there.

577
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,374
The steamer will be at the
Versova beach at 1 1 p.m. Tonight.

578
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:37,290
And... take this.

579
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,707
You'll get the gold
when you give this.

580
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:46,165
lf you're lying,
it'll be the last time you'll lie!

581
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:50,749
Because until we get the
gold you'll be held as a hostage.

582
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,582
l'm ready.
You keep the 5,00,000/- ready!

583
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:55,874
Rana.

584
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:49,915
Hello.

585
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:52,415
Yes.

586
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,332
Yes, yes.

587
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,082
Okay. Okay.

588
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,707
Listen, park the van in the garage.

589
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,915
And bring the stuff
here in an another car.

590
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:11,165
Your information was correct.
We got the gold.

591
01:06:11,916 --> 01:06:14,374
And now l must get my Rs.
5,00,000/-.

592
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,915
Of course. But...

593
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:23,582
You didn't say who you are.

594
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:27,540
My telling that will not
lower the price of the gold!

595
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:32,749
The work is done. l want my money!

596
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,290
We got the gold. Now what
if l don't pay you the money?

597
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,457
Sir, l knew a
fairy-tale as a child.

598
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:53,749
A man had a hen,
which laid a golden egg everyday.

599
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:58,957
One day he thought,
"why not tear the hen's stomach...

600
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,707
...and get the eggs
once and for all?

601
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:06,332
And he killed the hen! Think!

602
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:10,749
You want all your eggs today? Or...

603
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:18,207
- l was just pulling your leg.
- l knew it.

604
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:28,999
Here you are All of 500,000/-

605
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:35,207
- When will you inform me again?
- Very soon.

606
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:58,082
Come on, unload goods. Hurry up.

607
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:05,957
keep your hands up!
Thank you for all the trouble.

608
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,290
...you took to bring the gold here.

609
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,457
Now l'll take it to Mr.
Davar's godown from here.

610
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:17,790
Think. This kind of animosity
with Samant will prove expensive!

611
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:23,749
When l buy such trouble,
l don't care about the cost!

612
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,707
Face the wall. Come on!

613
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:38,165
Look the other way.

614
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:46,707
lf anybody turns round before this
van leaves the garage, l'll shoot.

615
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,124
And this time l won't
aim the bullet on the hand!

616
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:35,040
Someone dies..

617
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:46,249
Someone dies for someone,
it is never seen.

618
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:52,290
Let it be,
l have seen the world too.

619
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:57,582
Someone dies for someone,
it is never seen.

620
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:00,207
- Let it be.
- Let it be.

621
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:04,665
- Let it be, l have seen..
- The world too.

622
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:09,915
Let it be,
l have seen the world too.

623
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,707
- Someone dies..
- Someone dies..

624
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:17,749
Someone dies for someone,
it is never seen.

625
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:36,124
lt goes like this.

626
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:40,874
You are crazy for me, that's great.

627
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:47,665
But this love is
just for one night.

628
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:54,874
You are crazy for me, that's great.

629
01:10:55,458 --> 01:11:00,582
But this love is
just for one night.

630
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:11,415
Once the night passes away,
the matter will end.

631
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:22,374
You will come to your
senses again tomorrow.

632
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,957
Everyone falls in love.

633
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,832
Everyone is ready to
risk their life for it.

634
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,165
But l have seen
it only for a while.

635
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,165
- Let it be.
- Let it be.

636
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:41,665
- Let it be, l have seen..
- The world too.

637
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:47,040
Let it be,
l have seen the world too.

638
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:49,624
- Someone dies..
- Someone dies..

639
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:54,790
Someone dies for someone,
it is never seen.

640
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:27,207
Everyday you desire
a new gorgeous face.

641
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,290
Today you crave for her..

642
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:32,582
..but tomorrow you
will desire someone else.

643
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:43,457
When you will see a new face,
you will get restless.

644
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:54,332
You will change like the weather.

645
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:59,624
l have seen many
lovers earlier too.

646
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:04,582
l have seen this game earlier too.

647
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,165
- Let it be.
- Let it be.

648
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:13,582
- Let it be, l have seen..
- The world too.

649
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:18,707
Let it be,
l have seen the world too.

650
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:23,999
- Someone dies..
- Someone dies..

651
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:28,832
Someone dies for someone,
it is never seen.

652
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:01,832
- Just a moment.
Vijay, a call for you. - Me?

653
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:04,707
Thank you.

654
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:11,874
Hello.

655
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:16,957
- Vijay speaking.
- Congrats! That was a classic move!

656
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:20,957

01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,374
l promise, l'll finish it!

658
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:27,874
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

659
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:42,499
- Who was it?
- Samant, to congratulate me.

660
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,999
l see.

661
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:48,707
How did you get this
hole on your jacket's pocket?

662
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,790
- Samant's men took a shot at me.
- What!

663
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:56,332
Yes. But by chance...

664
01:14:57,083 --> 01:15:01,040
...l had my badge in my pocket.

665
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,957
Badge No. 786.

666
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:07,749
- So this thing saved you?
- Yes.

667
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:09,540
Very lucky. Come.

668
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:16,415
This is your share, plus the
5,00,000/- you brought with you.

669
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,207
- All this money...
- Yes, it's all yours.

670
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:41,207
Come in, Mom.
This will be our drawing-room.

671
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,749
Here, a small temple for you.

672
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,249
Come.

673
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:52,957
This is the kitchen, and...

674
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,915
...this, the dining room.

675
01:15:58,416 --> 01:16:00,124
That room there, will be Ravi's.

676
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:03,540
Come on upstairs.
l show you around.

677
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,832
But this house looks expensive.

678
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,332
Don't worry about that, Mom.

679
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:20,999
The people you're working for, will
they give you such a big house?

680
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:25,374
Look Mom.
The terrace that shall come here...

681
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:30,790
l hope you're not doing
something which you shouldn't do.

682
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:37,457
No, Mom, l'm not doing
anything l shouldn't be doing.

683
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:42,165
That's a load off my mind.

684
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:44,832
l think "load" is part of our fate.

685
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:47,749
lt slipped from my
shoulders to your mind.

686
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:49,457
Come.

687
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,499
Mom!

688
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:53,249
Brother! lt's fantastic!

689
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,832
- What happened?
- Tell us.

690
01:16:56,041 --> 01:17:00,165
- Why are you shouting so?
- Why not? lt's worth shouting for.

691
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:05,624
lt's simple fantastic. Everything
falls in place when the time comes.

692
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:08,707
l've been selected, and in 3
months l'll be a police inspector!

693
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:11,624
Brother, shake hand.

694
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:13,040
Bless me, Mom.

695
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:16,040
My blessings are always with you.

696
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:19,290
May God bless you
both with success.

697
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:29,749
- When will you reach, son?
- ln about 3 to 31/2 hours.

698
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:34,749
- Write to Mom, okay? - Sure.
- Will you come for the weekends?

699
01:17:35,666 --> 01:17:39,499
lf l write to you and
also come for the weekends.

700
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:42,999
...when will l get the time
for the training? And leave is...

701
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,957
Hello, Ravi. l'm so sorry for late.
You know what...

702
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,332
This is my mom, Viru.

703
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:57,332
Greetings!

704
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:01,165
Mom, this is Viru.
And this is my brother.

705
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,749
Hello!

706
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:09,957
Mom, she's my class-fellow.

707
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:14,249
- Shall we go. Mom?
- Let his train leave.

708
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:18,624
He's not a kid. He'll go.
l'll drop you and then go to work.

709
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:25,249
- Right then, Mom.
- Take care, son.

710
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:26,540
Yes.

711
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:31,790
She's nice.

712
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:32,915
Thank you.

713
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:39,999
See how sad Mom is!
And you? You even came late!

714
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:45,082
As if l came late purposely l
thought l'd bring you some flowers.

715
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:50,040
Okay, let's not fight.
Just one minute to go.

716
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,624
Say something sweet to me.
Hurry now.

717
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:55,707
You're going?

718
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:04,082
No, l came here to pass my time.
The train will go and l'll walk away.

719
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,624
Of course l'm going!
What a thing to ask!

720
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,832
Why get so angry?

721
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,957
Then why do you ask
such stupid questions?

722
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:46,540
Vijay.

723
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:51,124
Do you know how Sawant
comes to know our moves?

724
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:55,332
You must have seen Dayal.
He used to work for me.

725
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,457
He was Samant's man..

726
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:02,207
Dayal?

727
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:06,332
Yes, last night,
while crossing the road...

728
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,165
...he was run-over by a truck

729
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,915
Sir, just as, Sawant's man...

730
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:24,999
...was amongst us as an informer...

731
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:31,999
...why not have our
of our men in his camp...

732
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:34,999
...who'll inform
us about his plans.

733
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:37,832
l agree, Vijay...

734
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:45,249
...that you outsmarted Samant once.
But you don't know him. He's shrewd.

735
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:50,624
True. Samant never gives a
job to anyone without sifting him!

736
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,415
Lt'll be very difficult
for one of us to join him.

737
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,332
Suppose one man...

738
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:04,082
Today, what does Samant
want most of all? My life!

739
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:09,707
So, if a man like
say Darpan here...

740
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:15,749
Darpan should tell Samant,
that tomorrow night at 10.30...

741
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:20,124
...l'll be leaving a particular
bar, unarmed, and alone.

742
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:25,207
My car will be parked opposite,
and as l go towards my car...

743
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:31,040
...Samant's men can attack me.
- When you don't leave at 10.30...

744
01:21:31,416 --> 01:21:34,957
...Samant's men will...
- l'll leave at 10.30 sharp!

745
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:41,582
Then they will believe
that Darpan is our enemy.

746
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,790
A foe of the enemy is a friend.
That's why...

747
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,915
...Darpan will get a job there.

748
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,582
You're forgetting one thing.

749
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:57,624
lf you do leave at the said time,
then your life is in peril.

750
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:01,790
- And they'll certainly go for you.
- l know, sir.

751
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:07,374
ln this attack l may escape,
or l may die.

752
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:13,332
But in both cases,
your man, Darpan...

753
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:16,290
...will get a place
in Samant's gang.

754
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:44,332
Why did you tell
this to us about Vijay?

755
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,374
What is your benefit in it?

756
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,957
l have two benefits Samant sir.

757
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:53,957
He's the one who got me
thrown out of Davar's employment.

758
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:59,749
lf your men kill him,
l'll be more happy than you.

759
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:05,249
Secondly, if my information
pleases you, you may employ me.

760
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:10,915
lf you're telling the truth,
l may employ you.

761
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:17,790
But if it turns out to be
a trap you'll never walk again!

762
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:23,290
My information is correct.
Tonight, Vijay...

763
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:28,790
...will leave that bar alone
unarmed at 10.30 p.m. Sharp.

764
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:37,290
Jaggi, Rana.

765
01:23:51,583 --> 01:24:04,124
l am burning in love,
with a stranger.

766
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:05,165
Thank you.

767
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,499
No need to thank me.

768
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:13,249
l was looking for an excuse,
to talk to you, anyway.

769
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:20,082
l was thinking,
that at this very moment.

770
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:25,957
...nobody is as handsome,
nor so alone, as you, in this bar.

771
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:30,999
Who wants to risk his life,
and be with me at this moment?

772
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:38,957
May be you said that
so that l'd leave you alone.

773
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:43,332
Else, you don't seem to be
very disappointed with yourself.

774
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:08,915
This liquor is an amazing thing.
Each has his own reason to enjoy it.

775
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:15,915
Someone's drinking because he's
tired after a grueling day at work.

776
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:21,290
Some, because they did nothing
the whole day, and are bored.

777
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:26,082
Others, because they
are with their friends today.

778
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:32,332
And yet some,
because they are alone, Right?

779
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:35,374
Why am l thinking?

780
01:25:39,125 --> 01:25:40,415
Because you're awaiting someone.

781
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:47,665
And the ones l'm waiting
for must be awaiting me outside.

782
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:49,540
- Barman.
- Yes, sir.

783
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,290
For both the drinks.

784
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,415
Okay, sir.

785
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:01,124
Bye.

786
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:02,915
Thank you.

787
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:10,124
Excuse me, did you forget
something in the bar?

788
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,707
Were you waiting for these guys?

789
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,290
Yes?

790
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:43,040
What can be the name of
such a strange man like you?

791
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:44,582
Vijay.

792
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,707
Will you light a cigarette for me?

793
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:49,415
Sure.

794
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:04,999
- You didn't ask me my name?
- What's the point in asking?

795
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:10,582
Your kind of a girl changes
her name Like one changes clothes.

796
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:15,999
Yes, that's true.

797
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:22,249
And it's also true that l'm telling
a stranger; for the first time...

798
01:28:24,416 --> 01:28:27,832
...that my parents
had named me Anita.

799
01:28:36,416 --> 01:28:37,749
l'm proud of you my boy.

800
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:42,457
You really had a close shave
with death. But how did you escape?

801
01:28:44,041 --> 01:28:48,249
l was once again saved by this.

802
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:52,540
Badge No. 786!

803
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:59,040
Vijay, Come here.

804
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:06,915
From today,
you'll sit in this chair.

805
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:10,249
Sir?

806
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,249
Let me relax a bit now, my boy.

807
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:18,082
And you're managing everything
anyway. So why should l worry?

808
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:20,374
Best of luck.

809
01:29:22,041 --> 01:29:23,040
Jaichand.

810
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,582
Remember, Jaichand?
This happened years ago.

811
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:41,915
You threw money at a shoe-shine,
and he had refused to pick it up?

812
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:47,165
- Yes, l do, - And l had said that
one day this boy will go places?

813
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:52,832
l wasn't proved wrong.
Vijay is that very boy.

814
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:14,040
- Hello, Ravi.
- Bye.

815
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:16,415
There's a call for you from a girl.

816
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:17,624
Girl? Thanks.

817
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:21,415
You didn't call in 3 months and
how come you're phoning like this?

818
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:25,540
Hello Ravi, how are you?

819
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,999
Vira, you are..

820
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:32,332
Vira, l am fine.
l am coming back Vira..

821
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:36,957
My training is over and l'm
posted in Mumbai. l'm coming today.

822
01:30:37,041 --> 01:30:43,540
l'm so happy. l wish you were here
when l looking l wish to see you!

823
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:46,499
So why are you scratching your nut?
Just look up and see.

824
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:55,082
Oh my Vira! You naughty girl!

825
01:30:57,541 --> 01:30:58,665
Vira!

826
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:02,749
Look, he talked to
one girl on the phone..

827
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:04,165
..and he is embracing another one.

828
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,040
Some have all the luck.

829
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:09,707
- Shall l tell you?
- Yes.

830
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,957
- Or should l keep quiet?
- No.

831
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:18,999
About what my heart wishes for?

832
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:20,624
What is it?

833
01:31:50,791 --> 01:31:55,124
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?

834
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:58,999
About what my heart wishes for?

835
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,540
l will know it only
after you express it.

836
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:07,624
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.

837
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:08,582
Really.

838
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:12,749
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?

839
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:16,790
About what my heart wishes for?

840
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:19,332
l will know it only
after you express it.

841
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:25,582
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.

842
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:48,749
You have thought of
just keeping on going.

843
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:53,040
To make a world away from everyone.

844
01:32:53,375 --> 01:32:54,374
Am l right?

845
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:56,624
- Then tell me.
- Shall l tell you?

846
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:57,749
Yes.

847
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:01,957
l have thought of
taking you off course.

848
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:05,915
l want to trouble and
scare you in a lonely place.

849
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:07,749
No, no.

850
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:12,290
No, no don't do that.

851
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:17,457
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

852
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:21,665
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?

853
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,707
About what my heart wishes for?

854
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:28,290
l will know it only
after you express it.

855
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:34,457
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.

856
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,249
You have thought
of humming something.

857
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:08,582
Of dancing and making
me dance with happiness.

858
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:09,874
ls it correct now?

859
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:13,082
- Then tell me.
- Shall l tell you? - Yes.

860
01:34:13,291 --> 01:34:17,374
l have thought of
bringing you closer.

861
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:21,165
l have thought of
kissing your pink lips.

862
01:34:21,291 --> 01:34:23,249
No, no.

863
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:27,749
No, no don't do that.

864
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:32,874
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

865
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,040
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?

866
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:41,124
About what my heart wishes for?

867
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:43,707
l will know it only
after you express it.

868
01:34:43,791 --> 01:34:49,957
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.

869
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:54,749
Shall l tell you,
or should l keep quiet?

870
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:58,790
About what my heart wishes for?

871
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:01,332
l will know it only
after you express it.

872
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:06,790
l will consider you as smart,
l promise you that.

873
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:30,874
May Police Officer Ravi Verma,
come in?

874
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:34,332
Ravi.

875
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:36,040
Mother!

876
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:40,790
What are you doing? Let go of me!

877
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:46,790
Why didn't you pen you were coming?
l really thought it was a policeman!

878
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:50,249
You're great!
Am l not a real policeman?

879
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:52,040
- Yes you are looking.
- l'll be in Mumbai now.

880
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:56,165
- You'll see my colours soon.
Where's Vijay? - What can l say?

881
01:35:57,333 --> 01:36:01,374
Ever since he has started business
he doesn't get a moment's peace.

882
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:07,082
He comes in after midnight,
and hardly eats, if at all.

883
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:12,124
He doesn't even sleep peacefully.
He's forever tossing and turning.

884
01:36:13,625 --> 01:36:17,999
- Does money brings insomnia, son?
- lt's both ways.

885
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:23,415
Having money brings insomnia, and
not having it, brings deep slumber.

886
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:26,249
l think that's Vijay.

887
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,332
Mother!

888
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:34,707
Brother!

889
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:40,249
- When did he come? - Just now,
Mom says you come home late.

890
01:36:40,291 --> 01:36:45,957
She stays all alone in this house.
But l say the house looks great.

891
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:50,540
All this furniture, decoration...
How did you manage it so soon?

892
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:55,499
Being a policeman, are you?
Take a wash and change! Go on.

893
01:36:55,750 --> 01:37:00,124
Okay, l'll have a bath. l'm
very hungry, so serve food fast.

894
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:03,457
Vijay, you have a bath too.
We'll eat together.

895
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:04,999
He's an officer..

896
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:07,540
..but he still talks
the same way. Mad.

897
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,582
- l will serve the food, okay.
- Okay.

898
01:37:30,083 --> 01:37:35,124
All the hardships we experienced
were shared by Mom, l and Ravi

899
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:40,874
And after walking this long road,
together, side by side...

900
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:45,624
...Ravi and l have
drifted apart so much.

901
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:51,957
He's a police officer, and you...

902
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:57,207
l'm scared l may not have to hear,
what you dread to utter, from Ravi.

903
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,290
What are you thinking about?

904
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:10,749
l was thinking you've
given me this flat, this car.

905
01:38:12,541 --> 01:38:15,457
You've bought for me
whatever luxury you could buy.

906
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:20,499
Even that didn't surprise me,
But today...

907
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:28,124
...by telling me your life
story you've really bowled me!

908
01:38:29,541 --> 01:38:30,540
Why?

909
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:39,624
You are one of those who can
share his joys, but not sorrows.

910
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,249
l'm surprised, that today,
by sharing your woes with me...

911
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:48,499
...why have you honoured me so?

912
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:54,832
Don't know why,
but l feel you can understand me.

913
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:58,165
Yes, sir.

914
01:38:58,208 --> 01:39:04,124
Give me all the information
about those the police suspect.

915
01:39:04,958 --> 01:39:09,624
These are the names, but l'm sorry
that l don't know much about them.

916
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,290
One is, Mr. Davar,
to the public, he's a hotelier.

917
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:19,624
That's just a facade
17 years ago...

918
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:23,124
...he has served a
jail-term for smuggling.

919
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:30,707
He was lying low for years, but
now he's respected among smugglers.

920
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:33,957
There's another man with him.

921
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:36,207
..very interesting character..

922
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,332
Few years ago,
he was a dock-hand But nowadays...

923
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:44,874
...he owns a very
big garage l know...

924
01:39:45,166 --> 01:39:48,290
...this garage is just to throw
dust in eyes of law and police.

925
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:52,874
Actually l'm sure he's one
of Davar's biggest partners...

926
01:39:57,333 --> 01:39:58,457
His name?

927
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,999
Vijay Verma.

928
01:40:03,125 --> 01:40:06,915
There are some other
men who hang around there two

929
01:40:07,333 --> 01:40:11,624
Men like Jaichand, Santosh Mehta...

930
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:18,082
...Singhania. There are just small
fish in the lake. Here, keep this

931
01:40:19,541 --> 01:40:22,040
Ravi, are you alright?

932
01:40:23,208 --> 01:40:25,665
Yes sir, l am alright sir.

933
01:40:31,041 --> 01:40:32,040
Ravi.

934
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,207
Give this file to
some other officer.

935
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:47,082
- l can't take this particular case.
- What?

936
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:50,582
What's the matter?
Why can't you take it?

937
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,707
l demand an explanation.

938
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:55,540
Sir..

939
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:02,207
Vijay Verma is my brother.

940
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:05,582
He's my brother, sir.

941
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:07,040
Oh no.

942
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,499
l'm sure you understand
my position, sir.

943
01:41:13,416 --> 01:41:16,665
..l might not be able to
carry out this responsibility.

944
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:23,290
That's why, please give this
case to some other officer, sir.

945
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,207
l am sorry.

946
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,540
l can understand your feelings,
and l also...

947
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,665
...respect your honesty for
being so straightforward about it.

948
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:39,957
But even then, l'd like
you to be in change of this case.

949
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,332
- But, sir...
- Yes! l'd want it like that.

950
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:48,374
You've procured highest
marks in every selection test.

951
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:52,915
And today, there stands before
you the biggest test, which...

952
01:41:52,958 --> 01:41:57,582
...a police officer has to confront
very rarely. And you run away?

953
01:41:58,333 --> 01:42:00,957
No, sir l can't go
through with this test.

954
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:05,540
- l can't forget he's my brother.
- Think it over for today.

955
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:10,040
lf you still don't want to
go ahead l'll assign somebody else.

956
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:15,582
But before making a decision,
of any sort, just remember...

957
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:19,082
...that this is that disease
which a police officer treats...

958
01:42:19,375 --> 01:42:25,124
...by overcoming all the personal
feelings, like a doctor does.

959
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:30,249
Till today,
no doctor has operated on himself!

960
01:42:31,875 --> 01:42:35,040
But if you say so,
l'll give it a thought today.

961
01:42:45,000 --> 01:43:00,332
Thief! Thief! Catch him! Catch him!

962
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:31,499
Stop! Stop, else l'll shoot.

963
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:44,540
Stop yelling! l hit you in the leg.
You won't die.

964
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:47,707
Tell me! What did you steal?

965
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:55,332
Just for a loaf of bread?

966
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:58,582
- Salute, sir.
- Call on ambulance.

967
01:43:59,458 --> 01:44:00,874
- Your name?
- Chandar.

968
01:44:01,083 --> 01:44:02,124
Where do you live?

969
01:44:10,958 --> 01:44:13,040
Hello!

970
01:44:15,791 --> 01:44:19,915
- May l come in?
- Yes, come in.

971
01:44:27,875 --> 01:44:30,832
l'm sorry but l
haven't recognized you.

972
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:33,374
We've never met.

973
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:35,290
Then you must be Chander's friend.

974
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:42,707
- Are you his father?
- Well you see...

975
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:45,415
Chander's not at home.

976
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:51,832
l know. l know he's in hospital.

977
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:53,999
ln police custody.

978
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,124
lf you don't mind...

979
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:12,165
...l had brought a few things.

980
01:45:13,166 --> 01:45:14,165
What is it?

981
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:26,999
You didn't say who are you.

982
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:30,999
Well, l...

983
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:39,290
l'm that officer,
who had shot your son.

984
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:44,165
Get out!
And take these alms with you!

985
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:45,540
Get lost!

986
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:46,582
What is this?

987
01:45:46,791 --> 01:45:49,582
Law man, my foot!
Nice justice you give!

988
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:54,040
Does yourjustice shoot only
the poor? What had my son done?

989
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:58,707
He stole some bread for his parents.
lf you're such a legal-eagle...

990
01:45:58,875 --> 01:46:02,374
...go and shoot them,
who, hoard grain in their godowns.

991
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:08,624
Shoot them who are up to
their ears in black-marketing.

992
01:46:08,916 --> 01:46:12,707
l know nobody punishes them.
Only we get shot!

993
01:46:12,791 --> 01:46:13,707
Go!

994
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:20,082
Get out of my house! Get out!

995
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:23,540
l would like to apologize.

996
01:46:24,541 --> 01:46:28,290
My wife's uneducated, so she...
But l've no complain.

997
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:29,874
Whatever you did, was right.

998
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:35,832
Theft is a theft.
Whether of a penny or a 1,00,000/-!

999
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:41,665
Actually Chander wasn't like this.

1000
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:46,165
Maybe he couldn't bear
to see us go so hungry.

1001
01:46:47,375 --> 01:46:51,082
But millions die of hunger in lndia.
Should they all become thieves?

1002
01:46:52,041 --> 01:46:57,415
l've nothing against you.
Whatever you did... was right.

1003
01:47:04,416 --> 01:47:07,999
What do you do for a living?

1004
01:47:10,041 --> 01:47:14,874
l was a teacher in a school.
l retired last year.

1005
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:18,124
Now l do a few tuition's.

1006
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:24,749
l could've got such a lesson,
only from some teacher's home.

1007
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,999
Sir..

1008
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:58,832
- Yes, Ravi?
- l'm prepared to take the case, sir.

1009
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:01,374
Good luck.

1010
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:08,915
Santosh..

1011
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:10,957
Give Mr. Agarwal his check.

1012
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,624
Here you are, sir.

1013
01:48:17,041 --> 01:48:17,665
Thank you.

1014
01:48:17,708 --> 01:48:19,415
keep these building
papers with you.

1015
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:24,999
Mr. Vijay.

1016
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:29,124
Now that this deal is done,
may l say something?

1017
01:48:30,166 --> 01:48:34,374
You're buying this at a very
high price. Had you requested...

1018
01:48:34,625 --> 01:48:39,207
...l'd have taken much less from you.
Please don't mind my saying it.

1019
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:41,165
But you can't do business.

1020
01:48:42,416 --> 01:48:44,624
lt's you who can't do business.

1021
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:52,040
Even if you'd have asked 1,00,000/-
more for it, l'd have bought it.

1022
01:48:52,958 --> 01:48:56,915
Really? What's so special about it?

1023
01:48:57,958 --> 01:49:01,040
Twenty years ago, when
this building was being built...

1024
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:04,499
...my mother had carried
bricks on her head!

1025
01:49:06,208 --> 01:49:08,915
Today l'm giving it
as a gift to my mother.

1026
01:49:34,458 --> 01:49:35,457
Mother!

1027
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:56,749
What's the matter, Mom?
What is it, Ravi?

1028
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:01,790
Vijay, l want to
tell you something.

1029
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:20,290
Today the Police department.
Gave me a list.

1030
01:50:21,958 --> 01:50:26,332
lt has names of those,
who the police suspect...

1031
01:50:27,291 --> 01:50:29,207
...do smuggling and
other illegal trades.

1032
01:50:32,833 --> 01:50:35,457
One of those names... is yours!

1033
01:50:39,375 --> 01:50:41,040
Do you have anything
else to say to me?

1034
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,249
Sign this paper.

1035
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:50,499
What's in it?

1036
01:50:52,041 --> 01:50:56,082
lt says that you are
willing to become an approver.

1037
01:50:57,375 --> 01:51:01,915
You'll tell them about your crimes,
black money and name your colleagues.

1038
01:51:07,291 --> 01:51:08,999
l want your signature on this.

1039
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:27,624
Do you remember the nights we spent on
the pavement, starving, as kids?

1040
01:51:28,041 --> 01:51:31,249
- Will you sign it, or not?
- Do you remember...

1041
01:51:32,333 --> 01:51:36,707
...how mother had to labour
to earn 2 Rupees for her medicines?

1042
01:51:36,875 --> 01:51:42,207
- Will you sign, or not?
- D'you recall the abuse and rebuff?

1043
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:44,249
Vijay, will you sign, or not?

1044
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:53,249
Yes, l'll sign.

1045
01:51:57,666 --> 01:52:02,082
But l won't do it alone.
l won't be the first to sign!

1046
01:52:04,916 --> 01:52:08,499
Else, get that man's signature who
had taken my father's signature.

1047
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:13,499
Or that man's signature who had
thrown my mother out of herjob.

1048
01:52:14,875 --> 01:52:17,832
And that man's too who
had got this tattooed on my arm!

1049
01:52:18,291 --> 01:52:23,457
After that... l'll sign on any
paper you ask me to, dear brother.

1050
01:52:24,208 --> 01:52:27,165
One's sins are not lessened
by talking of other people's sins.

1051
01:52:28,125 --> 01:52:32,124
Proving others' crimes doesn't alter
the fact that you're a criminal.

1052
01:52:32,958 --> 01:52:37,665
And that fact, is a wall
between us, dear brother...

1053
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:40,207
...and as long as that wall exists,
we cannot live under one roof!

1054
01:52:43,333 --> 01:52:46,124
l'm leaving this house.
Now, this moment.

1055
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:50,957
- Come, Mom. - You can go,
but Mom will not go. - Come, Mom.

1056
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,999
- l said Mom will not go!
- Mother will go.

1057
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,540
No Mom. You can't leave me and go.

1058
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:03,124
- l know you love me Mom.
You can't leave me. - l'm going.

1059
01:53:03,458 --> 01:53:04,874
No Mom, you won't!

1060
01:53:05,916 --> 01:53:09,082
Who was that man who
made your father sign?

1061
01:53:09,833 --> 01:53:15,999
Nobody. lt's the same with
that man who abused, and fired me!

1062
01:53:16,541 --> 01:53:22,415
That man who tattooed your
name on your arm was also a nobody.

1063
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:29,582
But you? You were my son.
My flesh and blood.

1064
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:37,207
How could you tattoo on my head,
that her son is a thief?

1065
01:53:37,625 --> 01:53:41,707
But l did all this for you. This
bungalow, car, money, all for you!

1066
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:44,332
lt's all yours.
And you're leaving me?

1067
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,499
Vijay..

1068
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:52,374
A true businessman, l see.
May l tell you one thing, however?

1069
01:53:54,041 --> 01:53:56,290
Don't try to buy your mom.

1070
01:53:58,625 --> 01:54:03,874
You haven't become so rich,
as to buy your own mother.

1071
01:54:05,666 --> 01:54:07,540
Let's go, Ravi. Come.

1072
01:54:23,875 --> 01:54:27,124
Twenty years ago,
when this building was coming up...

1073
01:54:28,458 --> 01:54:30,999
...my mother carried bricks
on her head for its construction.

1074
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:34,665
Today l'm giving this building
as a gift to my mother.

1075
01:55:09,708 --> 01:55:12,624
Vijay, come in now.

1076
01:55:40,125 --> 01:55:41,124
Anita..

1077
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,957
Make me a drink.

1078
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:43,999
Sure.

1079
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,665
- Any cigarettes around?
- ln the cupboard inside.

1080
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:24,749
You wear saris too?

1081
01:56:28,208 --> 01:56:31,999
This is not a sari.
lt's a dream l carry in my mind.

1082
01:56:33,833 --> 01:56:35,790
Which was shattered
a long time ago.

1083
01:56:42,791 --> 01:56:44,999
Dreams,
like the waves on the seas...

1084
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:48,332
...shatter on the rocks
of life's realities.

1085
01:56:57,041 --> 01:56:58,457
Okay, Mom. l'm going to office.

1086
01:57:01,083 --> 01:57:02,290
- Mom!
- Yes?

1087
01:57:08,791 --> 01:57:10,040
May l say something?

1088
01:57:12,208 --> 01:57:16,999
l can't bear to see you sad.
lf you wish to go back to Vijay...

1089
01:57:17,958 --> 01:57:21,665
...l won't mind.
l'll drop you there myself.

1090
01:57:24,916 --> 01:57:25,915
No, Ravi.

1091
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:29,749
l'll stay here.

1092
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:32,290
With you.

1093
01:57:34,291 --> 01:57:36,040
Didn't you always ask...

1094
01:57:37,083 --> 01:57:38,999
...who was my favourite?

1095
01:57:40,583 --> 01:57:45,540
l'll tell you today. l've always...

1096
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:48,332
...loved Vijay more.

1097
01:57:49,791 --> 01:57:53,790
But my love is not blind.
lt can see...

1098
01:57:54,333 --> 01:57:58,082
...what good,
and what bad l've done.

1099
01:58:13,125 --> 01:58:14,124
Good evening, sir.

1100
01:58:15,125 --> 01:58:18,874
Ten minutes ago, cargo from the
ship has been sent in that godown.

1101
01:58:19,708 --> 01:58:21,624
Two minutes later 2
black trucks have gone in.

1102
01:58:23,416 --> 01:58:24,540
That means...

1103
01:58:24,666 --> 01:58:27,290
...the goods will leave
the godown in 5 minutes.

1104
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:37,540
Damn it!

1105
01:58:37,875 --> 01:58:42,665
This telephone's dead!
Go and get more police.

1106
01:58:42,791 --> 01:58:45,540
But what will you do alone?
You don't even have your pistol.

1107
01:58:47,333 --> 01:58:48,332
We lost.

1108
01:58:49,625 --> 01:58:52,915
You better hurry while
l wait for you here.

1109
02:00:31,291 --> 02:00:36,207
Stay where you are.
We've surrounded this place.

1110
02:00:39,916 --> 02:00:45,165
lt'll be better,
if you surrender yourselves to us.

1111
02:00:46,708 --> 02:00:52,790
l don't want any blood shed.
Thus l've come here to arrest you.

1112
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:58,790
Before l leave...

1113
02:00:59,708 --> 02:01:02,124
lf anyone tries to
leave this godown...

1114
02:01:03,291 --> 02:01:06,082
...he'll be rained with
bullets the moment he steps out!

1115
02:01:07,791 --> 02:01:11,415
So throw your pistols,
and stand in a line.

1116
02:01:11,541 --> 02:01:15,040
How do we know there are police?
Shankar, go and see.

1117
02:01:15,791 --> 02:01:16,790
Wait!

1118
02:01:23,333 --> 02:01:28,624
Why don't you see yourself?
Scared you might get shot?

1119
02:01:29,625 --> 02:01:33,749
Go! Open the door and see outside.

1120
02:01:34,666 --> 02:01:39,499
But if you get shot at, then, you'll
be responsible for your death!

1121
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,999
Go!

1122
02:01:46,125 --> 02:01:52,040
l'll give you a minute
to think Are you ready...

1123
02:01:53,041 --> 02:01:54,665
...to be just arrested,
or do you want...

1124
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,165
...to leave this place as wounded,
or as corpses?

1125
02:02:02,416 --> 02:02:03,415
Think it over.

1126
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:23,374
We're ready to do whatever you say,
inspector.

1127
02:02:29,291 --> 02:02:30,665
Give me your pistol.

1128
02:02:33,416 --> 02:02:36,665
- Even you, quickly.
- Hurry up.

1129
02:02:37,291 --> 02:02:39,207
Get down! Come on.

1130
02:02:39,958 --> 02:02:43,457
- Shankar, Shankar.
- Come on, join them.

1131
02:02:44,666 --> 02:02:48,332
- So there are no police outside?
- lf not, they'll be here soon.

1132
02:02:57,541 --> 02:03:02,207
This too is that Ravi Verma's job!
This is his sixth raid!

1133
02:03:02,583 --> 02:03:03,874
Within 2 months too!

1134
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:05,582
- lt's just too much.
- Davar, sir.

1135
02:03:07,041 --> 02:03:10,124
ln our field at times the
police win and other times, we win.

1136
02:03:11,333 --> 02:03:14,749
- This can't go on like this.
- But what about business?

1137
02:03:15,708 --> 02:03:18,915
l had promised these guys,
that l'd supply the stuff. But...

1138
02:03:19,875 --> 02:03:22,540
...thanks to Mr. Ravi Verma...

1139
02:03:22,666 --> 02:03:24,665
lf you can't supply the goods.

1140
02:03:24,875 --> 02:03:28,249
...give us our money back.
We can't wait any longer.

1141
02:03:31,458 --> 02:03:32,457
Mr. Mulchand.

1142
02:03:36,458 --> 02:03:38,374
lnspector Ravi Verma.

1143
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:44,290
- Did you see that?
- lt's a simple matter, sir.

1144
02:03:44,708 --> 02:03:50,374
Bump off this police officer.
What do you say, Vijay?

1145
02:03:51,166 --> 02:03:55,499
What's the point in killing him?
Another will come.

1146
02:03:57,791 --> 02:04:01,707
But he may not be as
clever as this Ravi Verma.

1147
02:04:02,125 --> 02:04:06,582
True. All alone,
and without any gun on him...

1148
02:04:06,708 --> 02:04:08,582
...he caught my 8 men red-handed.

1149
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,790
l still say, sir...

1150
02:04:10,833 --> 02:04:14,957
...send this officer to his Maker.
- keep the stupid advice to yourself.

1151
02:04:15,458 --> 02:04:16,874
Relax, Viiay relax.

1152
02:04:17,833 --> 02:04:19,415
He just said what came to him.

1153
02:04:19,833 --> 02:04:22,540
But he must think about
the consequences before speaking.

1154
02:04:23,375 --> 02:04:27,290
Every cop becomes a staunch
enemy of a person who kills a cop!

1155
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:29,040
Vijay..

1156
02:04:29,958 --> 02:04:34,624
ls this the only reason why
you don't want him to be killed?

1157
02:04:35,416 --> 02:04:37,165
lsn't there any other reason?

1158
02:04:40,208 --> 02:04:45,540
- What are you getting at?
- What nonsense! What other reason?

1159
02:04:46,375 --> 02:04:50,665
Well, Vijay, isn't there
any other reason? Tell us.

1160
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:53,499
Yes! He's my brother!

1161
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:58,790
And if you ever talk about him,
l'll have your tongue!

1162
02:05:35,166 --> 02:05:39,999
Thank God! l thought you
would come even here, in uniform!

1163
02:05:41,208 --> 02:05:44,040
- l'm not late, am l?
- Never mind.

1164
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,082
Those who travel by car,
are mostly late.

1165
02:05:50,375 --> 02:05:54,624
Do you know why l called
you to meet me here, Ravi?

1166
02:05:57,583 --> 02:06:00,082
lt's beneath you
to come to my house...

1167
02:06:01,791 --> 02:06:04,332
...and it's against my
principles to come to yours.

1168
02:06:05,958 --> 02:06:07,707
We could have only met elsewhere.

1169
02:06:08,708 --> 02:06:10,874
No, nowhere else, but here.

1170
02:06:13,125 --> 02:06:15,040
No matter how much
we may drift apart.

1171
02:06:16,083 --> 02:06:18,332
Our childhood can never
be separated from each other.

1172
02:06:20,875 --> 02:06:23,707
Today, when all the bridges
are broken between us...

1173
02:06:24,833 --> 02:06:28,040
...This was the only
one that remained.

1174
02:06:29,875 --> 02:06:33,624
This bridge...
under which we spent our childhood.

1175
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:36,290
Right here.

1176
02:06:39,833 --> 02:06:44,290
Before l say anything, l'd like
to ask... This particular moment...

1177
02:06:44,958 --> 02:06:49,332
...who's listening to me?
A brother, or a police officer?

1178
02:06:50,958 --> 02:06:54,957
As long as a brother will speak,
a brother will listen.

1179
02:06:56,500 --> 02:07:01,040
When a criminal will speak,
a police officer will listen.

1180
02:07:03,958 --> 02:07:09,040
You've made a lot of foes here.
l stopped them today...

1181
02:07:09,833 --> 02:07:11,374
But tomorrow l may not be able to.

1182
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,040
Take a transfer from here.
Go some place else.

1183
02:07:23,291 --> 02:07:25,915
ls the criminal, after discarding
the garb of a brother, saying this?

1184
02:07:29,833 --> 02:07:34,707
l think the wall between us,
is much higher than this bridge!

1185
02:07:36,041 --> 02:07:40,832
You don't know what the outcome
can be, of the path you tread.

1186
02:07:42,083 --> 02:07:45,124
The path l've taken,
its outcome may be terrible.

1187
02:07:47,375 --> 02:07:51,874
But the path that you tread,
leads to nothing but misery.

1188
02:07:55,375 --> 02:07:59,249
l've already played my card.

1189
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:02,207
Now l may lose, or win.

1190
02:08:03,875 --> 02:08:09,124
But you still have the time.
Go to some other posting.

1191
02:08:09,833 --> 02:08:15,624
No. My principles and,
my ideals don't allow me.

1192
02:08:16,166 --> 02:08:21,082
Your principles and ideals!
Of what use are they?

1193
02:08:22,416 --> 02:08:25,624
All your ideals and principles
cannot feed you 2 meals.

1194
02:08:26,708 --> 02:08:29,249
Those ideals for which you're
ready to stake your life...

1195
02:08:29,458 --> 02:08:30,707
...what did they bring?

1196
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:36,082
A Rs. 500/- worth of a job.
A hired quarter, and a jeep!

1197
02:08:36,958 --> 02:08:39,582
And this khaki uniform. Look at me.

1198
02:08:40,958 --> 02:08:45,874
l'm that same boy, and so are you.
We both had grown on this pavement.

1199
02:08:47,375 --> 02:08:50,207
But look where you've been
left and look where l've risen.

1200
02:08:51,583 --> 02:08:54,665
l've got real estate,
bungalows, a bank balance... a car.

1201
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,124
What do you have?

1202
02:08:59,875 --> 02:09:01,082
l have Mom!

1203
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:33,124
Hey, wake up. This is the last stop.
The train won't go further. Get up.

1204
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:39,749
- Unknown? - What else can l say?
- The body was found in a train.

1205
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:44,957
No sign of his name and nobody has
claimed the body. Thus, "unknown"

1206
02:09:46,833 --> 02:09:51,915
But he was in a train,
so he must be having some luggage.

1207
02:09:52,291 --> 02:09:57,957
This bundle with a few clothes.
And this photograph too.

1208
02:10:03,541 --> 02:10:06,999
The 3rd body is a woman,
Name Jamnabai. Age, 40.

1209
02:10:08,583 --> 02:10:10,040
You're not writing this down?

1210
02:10:17,208 --> 02:10:18,624
This body is not 'unclaimed'.

1211
02:10:22,208 --> 02:10:23,582
lt's not unclaimed.

1212
02:10:30,875 --> 02:10:35,165
ls that you?
How come you're early today?

1213
02:10:35,791 --> 02:10:40,582
Why are you standing?
Go change. There's no water today.

1214
02:10:41,291 --> 02:10:43,040
What could l have done, there
isn't a single drop of water..

1215
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:44,290
..since the morning.

1216
02:10:44,333 --> 02:10:47,374
l couldn't even cook.
We'll have to eat the left-over's.

1217
02:10:48,208 --> 02:10:51,582
What a headache! l didn't
even light the stove today.

1218
02:10:52,916 --> 02:10:56,124
ls this how it should be?
A man should die of thirst?

1219
02:10:57,625 --> 02:10:58,624
Ravi!

1220
02:11:15,375 --> 02:11:19,915
- Mom...
- No! No, Ravi, No!

1221
02:11:20,458 --> 02:11:25,040
Don't say that, son.

1222
02:11:25,875 --> 02:11:27,832
Don't say that!

1223
02:11:43,583 --> 02:11:48,124
We've to do the final rites. Light
the pyre. Where's the elder son?

1224
02:13:39,291 --> 02:13:43,332
Vijay, what shall l say to you?

1225
02:13:45,375 --> 02:13:49,790
Your brother left you.
Your mother's angry with you.

1226
02:13:51,875 --> 02:13:55,874
Every time l told you...
don't grieve about it.

1227
02:13:57,166 --> 02:14:01,540
But today...
How can l say this to you today?

1228
02:14:03,666 --> 02:14:07,457
- What has happened with you today?
- Nothing has happened, Anita.

1229
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,874
My father had died 20 years ago.

1230
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:16,957
Today he was cremated, that's all.

1231
02:14:18,791 --> 02:14:20,707
May l tell you something Vijay?

1232
02:14:22,958 --> 02:14:29,165
Get this removed by plastic
surgery. Else you'll never forget.

1233
02:14:31,125 --> 02:14:34,957
lf someone erases the lines from
his palm, will it change his fate?

1234
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:42,374
lt's not just on my arm,
but on my heart...

1235
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:45,457
...mind and soul too.

1236
02:14:47,250 --> 02:14:51,124
From where, no plastic
surgery on earth can remove it.

1237
02:14:54,625 --> 02:14:58,457
This can never be erased. Never!

1238
02:15:09,375 --> 02:15:12,207
- Right then, Mom.
- You're leaving, son?

1239
02:15:12,708 --> 02:15:16,957
- Had you been to the doctor?
- When will l go? - That's it!

1240
02:15:17,291 --> 02:15:21,999
l don't like this negligence!
keep all this. Relax sometimes.

1241
02:15:23,583 --> 02:15:27,582
The worry which eroded the heart,
is no more.

1242
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:30,999
Now it's nothing but rest for me.

1243
02:15:34,875 --> 02:15:39,540
- Here you are.
- l'll tell the doctor on my way.

1244
02:15:39,916 --> 02:15:43,665
- He'll come and examine you here.
- Who do you worry, son?

1245
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:54,957
- Have those calls been taped?
- Yes. Come with me.

1246
02:16:03,375 --> 02:16:06,415
This is the copy of all
those calls made on these numbers.

1247
02:16:08,708 --> 02:16:12,124
- Are you sure no calls were missed?
- This tape-recorder is automatic.

1248
02:16:13,125 --> 02:16:16,707
Any call made on these numbers,
turns on this recorder.

1249
02:16:17,083 --> 02:16:21,582
- Who are these guys?
- Obviously not decent people.

1250
02:16:24,250 --> 02:16:27,957
Nowadays even the smugglers have no
work but to romance on the phone.

1251
02:16:28,625 --> 02:16:30,374
- Sir, you keep on trying.
- Okay sir.

1252
02:16:32,666 --> 02:16:34,665
Sir, just a minute.

1253
02:16:44,291 --> 02:16:45,999
- Jaichand?
- Yes.

1254
02:16:46,125 --> 02:16:47,290
Do you have the stuff?

1255
02:16:47,666 --> 02:16:51,957
- Yes.
- Okay. Exactly at 4:45...

1256
02:16:52,208 --> 02:16:56,874
...leave your hotel
Sun and Sea by your car.

1257
02:16:57,958 --> 02:17:02,207
- En route, at any crossing,
Dindayal's men... - 10 mins. Left.

1258
02:17:02,458 --> 02:17:03,457
Okay.

1259
02:18:43,166 --> 02:18:44,165
Don't move.

1260
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:52,957
May l coming, sir?

1261
02:18:53,291 --> 02:18:56,290
- Come, Ravi.
- Jaichand has made a statement.

1262
02:18:56,458 --> 02:18:57,749
Very good.

1263
02:18:58,375 --> 02:19:03,457
l want warrants in the name of
Mr. Davar, and Vijay Verma.

1264
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:05,999
Okay.

1265
02:19:11,375 --> 02:19:12,374
Mr. Davar.

1266
02:19:15,666 --> 02:19:17,249
l've a warrant in your name.

1267
02:19:20,125 --> 02:19:21,124
l see.

1268
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,665
- Can l phone my lawyer?
- From the police-station.

1269
02:19:26,666 --> 02:19:27,832
Get the jeep.

1270
02:19:30,041 --> 02:19:34,290
lnform the D.C.P.
That l've picked up Davar.

1271
02:19:35,250 --> 02:19:37,207
Now l'm going to arrest Mr.
Vijay Verma.

1272
02:20:14,041 --> 02:20:16,249
Sub-inspector Verma here, yes.

1273
02:20:18,291 --> 02:20:19,707
No information as yet?

1274
02:20:22,375 --> 02:20:28,499
Highways, Railway. Stations, airport
keep a strict vigil on all these.

1275
02:20:29,583 --> 02:20:32,957
Vijay Verma must be holed
up somewhere in this city!

1276
02:20:33,708 --> 02:20:34,707
Okay.

1277
02:20:49,625 --> 02:20:53,957
So the police are very sure that
Vijay is hiding somewhere here.

1278
02:20:54,583 --> 02:20:56,582
That's what it says
in the papers at least.

1279
02:21:00,458 --> 02:21:05,040
The police must not get Vijay.
l must get him!

1280
02:21:06,875 --> 02:21:11,415
l had promised him.
He had started the game...

1281
02:21:12,375 --> 02:21:17,082
...but l'll finish it!
lf the police catch him...

1282
02:21:18,333 --> 02:21:20,082
...how will l keep my promise?

1283
02:21:54,791 --> 02:21:57,082
A very bad news, Vijay.

1284
02:21:58,791 --> 02:22:03,707
Mumbai's total police force, is
hounding me, what could be worse?

1285
02:22:03,875 --> 02:22:08,165
Your mother's very ill.
She's in the hospital.

1286
02:22:13,041 --> 02:22:14,457
l will go to meet mother.

1287
02:22:15,250 --> 02:22:18,082
There are police at every step.
You'll never reach the hospital.

1288
02:22:26,458 --> 02:22:27,457
Vijay.

1289
02:22:29,208 --> 02:22:30,207
Vijay!

1290
02:22:51,041 --> 02:22:52,290
How's your mother now?

1291
02:22:56,708 --> 02:23:02,624
Vira, sometimes there
comes a time in life...

1292
02:23:02,666 --> 02:23:05,665
...when one can't make out
what is right, and what is wrong.

1293
02:23:07,708 --> 02:23:12,790
Sometimes l wonder how
to get a son to see his mother.

1294
02:23:14,208 --> 02:23:19,749
But then l've also surrounded
this hospital with police so that,

1295
02:23:19,791 --> 02:23:22,790
lf Vijay Verma comes for his Mom,
he should be arrested at once.

1296
02:23:25,375 --> 02:23:30,249
You don't know, but in these veins
along with my father's blood...

1297
02:23:32,083 --> 02:23:36,082
...there flows my mother's milk,
and my brother's sweat too.

1298
02:23:38,166 --> 02:23:44,499
But after all this, is whatever
l'm doing, right? ls it correct?

1299
02:23:45,291 --> 02:23:49,290
Thousands of years ago,
Ariun had asked the same question..

1300
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,582
And do you know what
krishna said to him?

1301
02:23:54,291 --> 02:23:57,165
l know, dear, l know.

1302
02:23:57,958 --> 02:24:01,749
But the one who heard the
Lord was none other than Arjun.

1303
02:24:03,708 --> 02:24:07,707
And l'm no Arjun, my dear.

1304
02:24:35,875 --> 02:24:38,707
lt's impossible for you
to reach the hospital. l think...

1305
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:42,582
The police suspect you'll come
here. They've surrounded the place.

1306
02:24:43,708 --> 02:24:44,707
And Mom?

1307
02:24:46,041 --> 02:24:48,707
l had asked the nurse.
She's very serious.

1308
02:24:52,666 --> 02:24:55,749
And l can't go near my Mom!

1309
02:24:58,041 --> 02:24:59,374
There's no way, Vijay.

1310
02:25:01,958 --> 02:25:05,999
Mom always said,
when all the roads seem closed...

1311
02:25:06,958 --> 02:25:08,457
...there's only one way.

1312
02:25:10,583 --> 02:25:12,332
Today, l'll try that way and see.

1313
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:14,499
Come on!

1314
02:25:33,666 --> 02:25:35,415
Anita, you wait here.

1315
02:26:42,625 --> 02:26:46,290
You must be very happy today.

1316
02:26:49,375 --> 02:26:50,374
Look!

1317
02:26:52,125 --> 02:26:54,582
The one who didn't climb
Your temple's steps till today...

1318
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,540
Who didn't bow to You till now...

1319
02:26:59,750 --> 02:27:03,999
The one who never folded his hands
to You... is begging of You today.

1320
02:27:06,541 --> 02:27:12,665
You must be very happy
today Happy that today... l came.

1321
02:27:13,666 --> 02:27:15,999
But You know,
that as l stand here...

1322
02:27:17,125 --> 02:27:20,290
That woman, whose forehead
has worn out Your threshold...

1323
02:27:21,708 --> 02:27:26,249
That woman whose prayers
increased as her torments grew.

1324
02:27:27,250 --> 02:27:31,499
Who got wronged all her life, yet,
kept your lamp burning. That woman!

1325
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:35,957
That woman stands between
life and death today.

1326
02:27:36,791 --> 02:27:40,665
And it's Your defeat! Yes!

1327
02:27:42,458 --> 02:27:46,165
lt's Your defeat!
What wrong has she done?

1328
02:27:46,708 --> 02:27:50,582
What sin, or crime has she done?
That she's my mother?

1329
02:27:51,166 --> 02:27:55,499
That she gave birth to me?
ls it her fault that l love her?

1330
02:27:57,875 --> 02:28:01,165
What crime is she
being punished for?

1331
02:28:02,916 --> 02:28:05,332
We became homeless.

1332
02:28:06,875 --> 02:28:10,374
My father became a living corpse.
My mother...

1333
02:28:10,958 --> 02:28:15,457
...became a widow, having a husband.
Yet l never asked anything from You.

1334
02:28:17,541 --> 02:28:20,957
But today...
l'm asking for something.

1335
02:28:25,583 --> 02:28:27,957
Don't punish my mother
for the crimes l committed.

1336
02:28:31,541 --> 02:28:34,332
l'm surrendering myself to You.
Do what You like with me; but...

1337
02:28:37,208 --> 02:28:39,290
Give my mother back to me.

1338
02:28:42,458 --> 02:28:44,124
Give me my mother.

1339
02:28:46,166 --> 02:28:47,874
Give my mother to me.

1340
02:29:13,583 --> 02:29:15,165
- Anita!
- Hmm.

1341
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:18,915
My mother used to come
to this temple, every single day.

1342
02:29:20,208 --> 02:29:23,290
And we brothers used
to go our own way from here.

1343
02:29:25,291 --> 02:29:29,582
But that our paths
will differ so very much...

1344
02:29:30,916 --> 02:29:32,165
...l didn't know.

1345
02:30:01,291 --> 02:30:05,540
Before going home, son.
l'd like to go to the temple.

1346
02:30:06,458 --> 02:30:07,457
Okay, Mom.

1347
02:30:34,916 --> 02:30:37,332
- How are you now?
- Alright.

1348
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,332
Your son had come here.

1349
02:30:41,583 --> 02:30:46,832
Not this one, the other one.
He asked God to keep you alive.

1350
02:30:54,250 --> 02:30:57,707
Your mother's fine, Vijay.
She's at home now.

1351
02:30:58,750 --> 02:31:01,957
- Mom is alright now? Really?
- Yes.

1352
02:31:02,583 --> 02:31:04,207
That's good news you brought.

1353
02:31:04,416 --> 02:31:09,040
- Now l don't have any worry.
- Yes. - Come on, have this.

1354
02:31:09,583 --> 02:31:10,790
C'mon! Cheers!

1355
02:31:12,041 --> 02:31:12,874
Cheers!

1356
02:31:12,916 --> 02:31:14,165
You carry on.

1357
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,040
Won't you drink?

1358
02:31:18,833 --> 02:31:20,749
- l've stopped drinking.
- Why?

1359
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:28,249
l'm going to be a mother.

1360
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:37,332
The mother of your child.
But l won't force you to marry me.

1361
02:31:39,083 --> 02:31:42,999
Whatever may be...
l'll give birth to this baby.

1362
02:31:44,250 --> 02:31:49,249
And l'll try to give
such a life to my child...

1363
02:31:50,583 --> 02:31:54,290
...which, compared to my life,
and yours too...

1364
02:31:55,375 --> 02:31:56,457
...will be better!

1365
02:32:05,833 --> 02:32:11,207
l'll marry you, Anita.
Today. Right now.

1366
02:32:12,791 --> 02:32:16,832
After that l'll surrender
to the police. Yes, my dear.

1367
02:32:18,291 --> 02:32:20,749
lf we are to give a better
life to our child, then...

1368
02:32:21,875 --> 02:32:26,040
...l'll have to sacrifice this.
To make amends for my sins.

1369
02:32:27,958 --> 02:32:29,165
l don't want...

1370
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:38,040
l don't want anyone to tattoo on my
son's arm, "His father's a thief."

1371
02:32:40,958 --> 02:32:42,374
What's this, Anita?

1372
02:32:44,333 --> 02:32:45,332
Oh...

1373
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:50,040
How did tears flow today?

1374
02:32:51,875 --> 02:32:54,374
Come! We'll go to the temple.

1375
02:32:54,916 --> 02:33:01,040
Will you wait for some time?
l'll just dress up and come.

1376
02:33:02,375 --> 02:33:04,249
My mother had given me a sari.

1377
02:33:06,208 --> 02:33:09,290
Mother's no more, but that dream...

1378
02:33:10,875 --> 02:33:14,749
...is still with me even today.
May l go now?

1379
02:33:15,041 --> 02:33:17,207
Go, Anita. l'll wait for you.

1380
02:33:43,833 --> 02:33:44,832
Hello!

1381
02:33:45,708 --> 02:33:46,790
Who's speaking?

1382
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:49,499
Mother!

1383
02:33:52,833 --> 02:33:53,832
Vijay!

1384
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,207
How are you, Mom?

1385
02:34:03,708 --> 02:34:06,790
l'm coming to the temple, Mom.

1386
02:34:08,541 --> 02:34:12,290
l want your blessings.
After that it'll be as you say.

1387
02:34:14,708 --> 02:34:16,082
You will come to bless me?

1388
02:34:19,791 --> 02:34:23,415
Of course l'll come, son.
Most certainly.

1389
02:34:27,541 --> 02:34:28,540
Mom...

1390
02:34:31,583 --> 02:34:32,582
Mom... you...

1391
02:35:23,833 --> 02:35:25,540
- Where's he?
- Who?

1392
02:35:26,375 --> 02:35:27,540
The one who has 'kept' you.

1393
02:35:27,958 --> 02:35:32,624
- l don't know.
- Who's wanted by me and the police.

1394
02:35:33,166 --> 02:35:34,457
l don't know anything.

1395
02:35:39,166 --> 02:35:43,582
You don't know, eh?
lf you don't tell us...

1396
02:35:45,083 --> 02:35:48,082
...you'll die a terrible death!
Where is he?

1397
02:35:53,708 --> 02:35:56,832
- Everything's done.
- What's the time in your watch?

1398
02:35:57,666 --> 02:35:58,874
9 o'clock.

1399
02:36:00,125 --> 02:36:01,165
lt's very late.

1400
02:36:01,916 --> 02:36:04,790
The boat is hired and we'll
have to leave shortly from here.

1401
02:36:05,375 --> 02:36:08,499
By tomorrow, we'll be
miles away from this place.

1402
02:36:10,666 --> 02:36:11,665
You all go.

1403
02:36:16,208 --> 02:36:21,040
l've come very far as it is.
l'll have to go back now.

1404
02:36:36,083 --> 02:36:40,249
Anita!

1405
02:36:46,583 --> 02:36:47,582
Anita?

1406
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:58,874
Anita!

1407
02:36:59,250 --> 02:37:04,040
Don't leave me and go, love.
l'll be all alone; so lonely.

1408
02:37:06,041 --> 02:37:07,040
Anita!

1409
02:37:08,416 --> 02:37:09,665
- Vijay.
- Yes, Anita.

1410
02:37:11,708 --> 02:37:15,832
We had thought of so
many things short time ago.

1411
02:37:17,833 --> 02:37:21,124
Our child. Our home.

1412
02:37:23,250 --> 02:37:28,540
- And now all our dreams are shattered.
No, my dear.

1413
02:37:30,208 --> 02:37:31,499
- Vijay!
- Yes.

1414
02:37:31,916 --> 02:37:37,207
- Hold me close to you.
- Yes, Anita.

1415
02:37:37,541 --> 02:37:39,749
- Closer, closer.
- Yes, Anita.

1416
02:37:40,375 --> 02:37:42,665
- Don't be scared.
- l won't, Vijay.

1417
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:46,249
l won't let you die.
No l won't, Anita.

1418
02:37:50,041 --> 02:37:52,832
l had died... long ago, Vijay.

1419
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:59,624
Today, it's kind of...

1420
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:05,457
...a new birth for me.
- No... Just tell me who they were.

1421
02:38:06,500 --> 02:38:09,915
- Who were they, dear?
- l'm scared...

1422
02:38:10,791 --> 02:38:15,540
l'm scared what you might do.

1423
02:38:15,666 --> 02:38:16,957
Please, Anita. Please.

1424
02:38:17,291 --> 02:38:23,957
l told... them... nothing.

1425
02:38:25,125 --> 02:38:27,457
No, Anita... No!

1426
02:38:28,625 --> 02:38:29,624
No!

1427
02:38:31,375 --> 02:38:35,999
Anita!

1428
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:26,832
Samant!

1429
02:40:22,083 --> 02:40:24,124
l want Samant. Where's he?

1430
02:40:24,458 --> 02:40:25,874
Giria palace, top floor.

1431
02:40:30,833 --> 02:40:32,040
What are you saying?

1432
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,040
Are you sure it was Vijay Verma?

1433
02:40:40,583 --> 02:40:45,165
All this proves that he
went towards Samant's house.

1434
02:40:46,166 --> 02:40:47,790
We'll surround Samant's house.

1435
02:40:49,041 --> 02:40:50,040
Yes sir!

1436
02:40:50,791 --> 02:40:51,999

1437
02:40:52,875 --> 02:40:55,832
Today the police will
definitely catch Vijay Verma.

1438
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,082
At any cost.

1439
02:40:58,458 --> 02:40:59,457
Yes, sir.

1440
02:41:07,166 --> 02:41:13,957
Today l want your strength
and your blessings, Mom.

1441
02:41:29,708 --> 02:41:34,165
May God not tremble your hand,
when you shoot.

1442
02:41:51,083 --> 02:41:52,415
You're going?

1443
02:41:53,291 --> 02:41:57,957
Yes. A woman has done her duty.

1444
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:02,082
Now a mother is going
to wait for her son.

1445
02:42:06,833 --> 02:42:09,457
Who is it?

1446
02:42:12,125 --> 02:42:13,290
Who the hell are you?

1447
02:42:22,291 --> 02:42:24,457
You! Why are you here?

1448
02:42:28,791 --> 02:42:31,290

1449
02:42:33,375 --> 02:42:36,207

No! No Vijay!

1451
02:42:51,166 --> 02:42:55,457
No Vijay, no.

1452
02:43:48,750 --> 02:43:52,457
Go up wjth your men.
And you all, surround the building.

1453
02:43:59,708 --> 02:44:00,707
Viiay Verma..

1454

You'll come to bless me, Mom?

1463
02:46:03,041 --> 02:46:06,499
Of course l'll come, son.

1464
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,957
Brother! Brother stop!

1465
02:46:57,333 --> 02:46:58,457

Put me to sleep thjs once again.
