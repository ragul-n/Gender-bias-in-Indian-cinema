One notice for a grandson...

1288

She stays in Ludhiana.

1306
01:07:14,144 --> 01:07:15,618
...where many years ago, my...

1307
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:18,429

Do you know the spelling
of Balwinder Singh?

1314

Quiet!

1315
01:07:39,715 --> 01:07:41,293
Good thing that you all understood fast...

1316

...otherwise brother speaks
less and shoots more.

1317
01:07:43,383 --> 01:07:44,750
- Hey!
- The stink is coming from there only.

1318
01:07:44,945 --> 01:07:46,579
I am talking about brother's gun.

1319
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:51,893
There is so much
grimmness on all your faces...

1320
01:07:52,465 --> 01:07:55,548
...that it does not look like
any of you are from our family.

1321

Our blood.

1322
01:07:56,862 --> 01:07:58,665
Brother,
have you called us here to insult us?

1323
01:07:58,725 --> 01:08:00,449
Yes, we have called to insult you all.

...you all should have
seen your faces in the mirror.

1327

All of you look like conmen,
pickpocketers and thieves.

Hey, who are you calling
thief and pickpocketer?

He will pull out all
the pillars of this mansion.

Whether there is a real Balwinder
Singh among you or not.

What happened? Did we get any result?

might have grandsons of their own.

Sir but from them...

1362
01:10:07,824 --> 01:10:10,061
- ...four have given correct answers.

Four of them have given correct answer?

Means, one of those four must be my blood,
my grandson.

- This can be a plot against us also.
- No, no.

...and here I will take blessings from you,
I bow my head to your feet, grandfather.

1547
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:02,332
Blessing's and all...

1548
01:20:04,272 --> 01:20:06,901
...your work will not be
done by a single blessing...

1549
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:10,417
...you need double blessings,
I will get you that.

1550
01:20:11,051 --> 01:20:13,087
Hey Mantuk, my friend...

1551
01:20:13,299 --> 01:20:14,988
You just do this much for me...

1552
01:20:15,934 --> 01:20:18,966
...no, no I have got all the settings
done, you don't take any tension.

1553
01:20:19,185 --> 01:20:21,768
- Who is this conman talking to on the
phone? - You just pick up that old lady...

1554
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:23,885
- ...and come straight to the mansion.
- Oh no.

1555
01:20:24,077 --> 01:20:28,494
- That's it.
- Wow! You don't have a home...

1556
01:20:28,519 --> 01:20:30,399
...and you are calling Mantuk.

1557
01:20:30,476 --> 01:20:32,668
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

1558
01:20:32,693 --> 01:20:35,152
But here are not looking for Mantuk here,
we are looking for the grandson.

1559
01:20:35,633 --> 01:20:36,685
What list is this?

1560
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:39,232
- It is a list of old things, Mr. Pyare.
- Means?

1561
01:20:40,103 --> 01:20:43,619
Means anything old that I
see in my mansion here...

1562
01:20:44,066 --> 01:20:45,324
...understand it is going to be out.

1563
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,281
In your mansion?

1564
01:20:47,617 --> 01:20:49,035
Means you have been
announced as the grandson?

1565
01:20:49,188 --> 01:20:50,183
Spoke like a true low class man.

1566
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,102
There is something called confidence,
Mr. Pyare.

1567
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,604
Anyways, how old are you in this mansion?

1568
01:20:56,299 --> 01:20:58,214
What about me? Understand...

1569
01:20:58,398 --> 01:21:01,544
...that from being a child,
to growing up...

1570
01:21:01,569 --> 01:21:04,188
I have travelled that entire journey,
what do you understand?

1571
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:05,789
That you are old piece.

1572
01:21:05,955 --> 01:21:07,279
- Piece?
- Mr. Pyare!

1573
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:09,509
But don't worry...

1574
01:21:09,972 --> 01:21:12,639
...under my rule you
can stay here comfortably.

1575
01:21:12,927 --> 01:21:15,359
Under your rule, stay here comfortably?

1576
01:21:15,631 --> 01:21:17,763
- Till when?
- Till...

1577
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:20,345
...night blindness...

1578
01:21:20,425 --> 01:21:22,008
...paralysis, leprosy...

1579
01:21:22,142 --> 01:21:25,747
...piles, horrible diseases like
these don't catch you.

1580
01:21:27,058 --> 01:21:30,487
Take care of yourself, I am going.
Greetings!

1581
01:21:32,624 --> 01:21:37,018
Night blindness, paralysis,
leprosy, piles, how will I look?

1582
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:40,838
Brother!

1583
01:21:41,745 --> 01:21:43,028
Brother!

1584
01:21:43,587 --> 01:21:44,905
All these four Balwinder's...

1585
01:21:45,037 --> 01:21:47,289
...have stuck to the
mansion like it's their own.

1586
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:48,967
Instead of this problem being solved...

1587
01:21:49,136 --> 01:21:50,723
...it is becoming more complicated.

1588
01:21:51,014 --> 01:21:53,521
Who is the real heir to this property?

1589
01:21:53,728 --> 01:21:57,061
I am the only heir to this property,
only me!

1590
01:21:58,505 --> 01:22:01,331
Morning, evening, day, night...

1591
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,251
I have been uncle's shadow.

1592
01:22:04,945 --> 01:22:06,372
Every happiness of mine...

1593
01:22:06,865 --> 01:22:08,522
...every wish, I have killed...

1594
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:11,508
...and just saw his happiness.

1595
01:22:12,151 --> 01:22:13,253
Only because...

1596
01:22:13,945 --> 01:22:15,823
...after he goes...

1597
01:22:16,385 --> 01:22:17,798
...all this is mine.

1598
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,600
Brother, that was going to happen...

1599
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:21,184
...he had also made a will...

1600
01:22:21,225 --> 01:22:24,946
...and because I am his driver's son,
I would have got some share also.

1601
01:22:24,994 --> 01:22:26,674
I would have also
spent my life in luxury...

1602
01:22:26,785 --> 01:22:29,036
...but God knows from where
he saw that old woman...

1603
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,341
...and the story changed.

1604
01:22:30,496 --> 01:22:31,167
[GASPS]

1605
01:22:31,192 --> 01:22:32,957
Brother, talking about the old woman,
I remembered...

1606
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:35,409
...sir is still living
in the belief that...

1607
01:22:35,465 --> 01:22:38,125
...the day Jamuna comes into
her senses she will tell him...

1608
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,364
...who his real grandson is.

1609
01:22:39,409 --> 01:22:42,832
If that happens you will not
be left with anything, brother.

1610
01:22:45,656 --> 01:22:46,691
That...

1611
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:49,685
...will never happen.

1612
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,369
Stop! Stop! Come mother.

1613
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,388
This looks like some kings palace.

1614
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:58,878
This is where your son
stays mother, come. - Really?

1615
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:01,825
Hey, which son? Whose son?

1616
01:23:01,866 --> 01:23:03,650
Anyone just walks in!
Who is this old woman?

1617
01:23:03,944 --> 01:23:06,292
Hey, talk with respect...

1618
01:23:06,505 --> 01:23:07,566
To hell with you!

1619
01:23:07,865 --> 01:23:09,584
I am Balu's mother.

1620
01:23:09,625 --> 01:23:11,777
- Who Balu?
- Balwinder Singh!

1621
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:14,290
There are four Balwinder's here,
which Balwinder are you talking about?

1622
01:23:14,484 --> 01:23:16,005
Whether there are four or fourty...

1623
01:23:16,065 --> 01:23:18,181
I will recognise my son.

1624
01:23:18,248 --> 01:23:20,172
A mother will always recognise her son.

1625
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:22,940
Come.

1626
01:23:24,585 --> 01:23:27,543
Hey mother why are you standing
on the steps, they will get dirty.

1627
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,365
Come inside.

1628
01:23:29,745 --> 01:23:31,417
- Come on, come on.
- Who are you?

1629
01:23:31,837 --> 01:23:34,992
I am Balwinder's childhood friend.

1630
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,024
Childhood friend!

1631
01:23:36,076 --> 01:23:37,472
Do you want to have anything?
Anything hot or cold?

1632
01:23:37,549 --> 01:23:38,512
No, I will rest now.

1633
01:23:38,604 --> 01:23:40,098
Okay, so you will rest?

1634
01:23:40,221 --> 01:23:41,561
Why did you come by rickshaw?

1635
01:23:41,602 --> 01:23:42,775
The old woman is not
used to sitting in the plane.

1636
01:23:42,819 --> 01:23:43,209
Okay!

1637
01:23:43,339 --> 01:23:44,914
Then make it a habit. Sit inside.

1638
01:23:45,118 --> 01:23:47,106
- Some are like ghosts...
- Oh son...

1639
01:23:47,131 --> 01:23:49,825
- Mother...
- Drop him where he came from...

1640
01:23:49,885 --> 01:23:51,196
...otherwise throw him in the river.

1641
01:23:51,256 --> 01:23:53,111
Otherwise I will shoot you, go!

1642
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,680
- Son.
- Move. Go.

1643
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,236
Don't look behind!

1644
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:58,817
She is mother, mother!

1645
01:23:59,396 --> 01:24:01,753
Get her inside with a lot of respect.

1646
01:24:01,813 --> 01:24:04,391
Mother, you come, I will let sir know.

1647
01:24:04,682 --> 01:24:05,714
Sir!

1648
01:24:05,949 --> 01:24:08,343
- Come, come.
- Mother is here.

1649
01:24:11,152 --> 01:24:14,788
Sir! Mother is here.

1650
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:21,042
Sir will come here, you wait.

1651
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:22,349
- Okay.
- Come on.

1652
01:24:28,649 --> 01:24:30,687
Hey old woman, who are you?

1653
01:24:31,111 --> 01:24:33,403
- And how did you come inside this palace?
- Hey you idiot!

1654
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,665
I look like a old woman in this age?

1655
01:24:35,745 --> 01:24:38,655
And if my son hears it,
you are in trouble.

1656
01:24:38,743 --> 01:24:40,329
Son? Who son?

1657
01:24:40,465 --> 01:24:43,103
Hey Brother,
she is Balwinder Singh's mother.

1658
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:44,955
Sir, her.

1659
01:24:45,321 --> 01:24:47,069
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

1660
01:24:48,457 --> 01:24:49,771
Is Balwinder Singh your son?

1661
01:24:50,339 --> 01:24:52,937
Yes, call my son fast.

1662
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:55,372
I cannot stay a minute also now,
without seeing him.

1663
01:24:55,926 --> 01:24:58,311
I want to hug him.

1664
01:24:58,832 --> 01:25:00,297
Who all will you hug?

1665
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,162
There are four Balwinder Singh here.

1666
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:04,917
Brother, their names can be the same...

1667
01:25:04,977 --> 01:25:06,739
...but their faces cannot be the same,
right?

1668
01:25:06,946 --> 01:25:09,656
You call them, I will recognise my son.

1669
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:12,462
- Go and call each one individually.
- Okay sir.

1670
01:25:20,754 --> 01:25:23,434
Who is your son from these?

1671
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:24,907
No.

1672
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,374
Looks like Mantuk has done his work.

1673
01:25:34,537 --> 01:25:35,532
Mother!

1674
01:25:37,164 --> 01:25:39,193
You have come?
Bow my head to your feet mother.

1675
01:25:41,785 --> 01:25:43,464
- How are you?
- Means?

1676
01:25:44,401 --> 01:25:45,819
- Is she your mother?
- No.

1677
01:25:46,145 --> 01:25:48,014
Then, why did you touch her feet?

1678
01:25:48,505 --> 01:25:52,108
I have learnt this ritual from
her son only, grandfather.

1679
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:54,185
But who is her son?

1680
01:25:54,862 --> 01:25:56,683
Brother, you also...

1681
01:25:56,745 --> 01:25:58,227
...see I am also here...

1682
01:25:58,392 --> 01:26:00,261
...these two are also here, who is left?

1683
01:26:00,514 --> 01:26:02,326
Balwinder Singh from Ludhiana...

1684
01:26:02,705 --> 01:26:06,276
...whose lies, cheat and fraud...

1685
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:08,650
...will be exposed here in this room.

1686
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:10,891
What is he saying about my son?

1687
01:26:11,665 --> 01:26:13,474
What has Balu done here?

1688
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:18,054
Here he comes,
not a wolf in a sheep's clothes...

1689
01:26:18,114 --> 01:26:19,388
...but a free bull.

1690
01:26:19,569 --> 01:26:22,198
Who in the greed of becoming
the heir to this mansion...

1691
01:26:22,433 --> 01:26:25,043
...has cheated my innocent grandfather,
and...

1692
01:26:25,487 --> 01:26:27,224
...even is real mother.

1693
01:26:27,536 --> 01:26:28,569
Real mother!

1694
01:26:29,016 --> 01:26:30,725
It is such a bad thing.

1695
01:26:31,036 --> 01:26:32,745
Who must be tired of standing here.

1696
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,413
Hey,
if you care so much about the elders...

1697
01:26:35,438 --> 01:26:36,687
...then call my son.

1698
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,289
Where is he, why can't I see him?

1699
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,009
What are you doing?

1700
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:43,109
Your Balwinder Singh is
standing in front of your eyes.

1701
01:26:43,305 --> 01:26:44,985
Go, and meet your son.

1702
01:26:45,172 --> 01:26:47,420
Hey rascal, whose son?

1703
01:26:47,561 --> 01:26:48,716
BALWINDER'S MOTHER: Whose mother?

1704
01:26:48,897 --> 01:26:50,587
If he was my son...

1705
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,029
...would I be standing here...

1706
01:26:52,585 --> 01:26:53,973
I would go...

1707
01:26:54,745 --> 01:26:57,665
...and hug him like that.

1708
01:26:57,705 --> 01:27:00,659
Grandfather she is lying, see there faces
are also similar, she is his mother only.

1709
01:27:00,787 --> 01:27:03,088
Hey, don't move ahead...

1710
01:27:03,209 --> 01:27:05,012
...how many times have
I told you to keep quiet.

1711
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,728
You should learn how to
keep quiet in front of elders...

1712
01:27:07,873 --> 01:27:10,404
I am seeing you are talking continously...

1713
01:27:10,608 --> 01:27:12,871
...and I said this is not my son.

1714
01:27:13,427 --> 01:27:15,023
If he was my son...

1715
01:27:15,121 --> 01:27:17,512
...my hand would not be down...

1716
01:27:17,808 --> 01:27:21,029
...it would be on his head.

1717
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,432
Stop it? What is all this?

1718

Brother, you don't get angry...

1719
01:27:27,431 --> 01:27:28,962
...it is not this child's mistake...

1720
01:27:29,018 --> 01:27:31,898
All this is Mantuk's mistake
who got me here by mistake...

1721
01:27:31,978 --> 01:27:34,134
I am going to pull his
ears when I go back.

1722
01:27:34,772 --> 01:27:36,078

Both of them are actors.

1725
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:51,145
Hey Patialewala!

1726
01:27:52,078 --> 01:27:53,195
BALWINDER: The game changed isn't it?

1727
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:56,563
You thought my mother will recognise me,
and...

1728
01:27:56,691 --> 01:27:58,053
I would be thrown out from this mansion...

1729
01:27:58,722 --> 01:28:01,407
...whose only heir is just me.

1730
01:28:01,865 --> 01:28:04,430
This dream of yours will
remain a dream only...

1731
01:28:04,884 --> 01:28:06,950
...because I have now
understood everything...

1732
01:28:07,285 --> 01:28:09,908
This Julie who has become
Laxmi and come to this mansion...

1733
01:28:09,968 --> 01:28:11,373
...is actually your informer...

1734
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:13,594
...and because of her
you have reached till here.

1735
01:28:14,059 --> 01:28:16,087
But remember one thing...

1736
01:28:16,466 --> 01:28:19,328
...that in your horoscope,
there is no money or fame...

1737
01:28:19,703 --> 01:28:21,985
...because my name is on both these.

1738
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:24,034
That only time will tell.

1739
01:28:25,183 --> 01:28:27,492
You still have time, leave.

1740
01:28:28,328 --> 01:28:30,321
Otherwise you will loose everything.

1741
01:28:30,994 --> 01:28:32,540
Then you also listen
to the latest quote...

1742
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:34,977

don't understand easily.

means sir Rai Bahadur...

Yes, I am telling you...

- ...please come, there is some work.
- Right away.

1750
01:28:55,652 --> 01:28:57,152
Your fate is so bad...

1751
01:28:57,564 --> 01:28:59,230
...you did not get Julie nor Laxmi.

1752
01:28:59,616 --> 01:29:01,615
You just keep doing hard work here.

1753
01:29:05,945 --> 01:29:06,931
Come on.

1754

...then my name is not
Balwinder Singh Patialewala.

1757
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:24,228
Brother, whatever happens
I will be with you.

1758
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:28,843
Brother, see how sad he is.

1760
01:29:31,236 --> 01:29:34,664
- Should I push him down?
- No let's take his class, come brother.

1761
01:29:37,345 --> 01:29:38,416
What brother...

1762
01:29:38,579 --> 01:29:41,668
...you are sitting and counting
the pillars of the mansion or what?

1763
01:29:42,145 --> 01:29:43,459
- Oh Mr. Pyare.
- Yes!

1764
01:29:43,785 --> 01:29:45,578
- Greetings, brother!
- Greetings!

1765
01:29:45,999 --> 01:29:48,769
I was just thinking that
from a person's face...

1766
01:29:48,829 --> 01:29:50,637
...can we come to know his character?

1767
01:29:50,705 --> 01:29:52,585
No, no not all, see yourself...

1768
01:29:52,742 --> 01:29:55,399
...you look like a number one thief,
conman or a fraud?

1769
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:58,101
- But you are not.
- Correct.

1770
01:29:58,431 --> 01:30:02,040
Now even if a man looks like a rascal,
rogue, scoundrel from his face...

1771
01:30:02,165 --> 01:30:04,640
...even if he is so clean
and decent from inside...

1772
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:05,942
...how does one find that out?

1773
01:30:06,456 --> 01:30:07,911
Now look at that Banarsi silk...

1774
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,085
Banarsi silk?

1775
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,324
Oh our Laxmi!

projects a pure clean...

around in the whole mansion...

1778
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:17,397
...but what is her reality?

1779
01:30:17,961 --> 01:30:21,219
- What is it?
- She is a number one conwoman.

1780
01:30:21,317 --> 01:30:22,612
No, no that is not possible.

- I swear on your head...
- Hey don't swear on my head!

Okay, okay.

1783
01:30:26,941 --> 01:30:30,684
Brother,
you go and see in Mr. Rustom's colony...

1784
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:32,142
...what charisma she has...

1785
01:30:32,317 --> 01:30:33,998
Mini skirt, tank top...

1786
01:30:34,258 --> 01:30:36,051
...if she is Laxmi here,
she is Julie there.

she is Geeta there...

'Hum Aapke Hai Kaun'.

1791
01:30:44,725 --> 01:30:47,363
- What are you saying?
- Brother, believe me.

1792
01:30:47,545 --> 01:30:51,711
This is a collusion between Laxmi
and Balwinder Singh Ludhianawala.

1793
01:30:51,752 --> 01:30:52,831
He has her full support.

1794

She wants that he should
become this mansions only heir.

1795

Let Laxmi worship that
Ludhianawala as much as she wants...

really that Laxmi...

He is lying.

That Ludhianawala looks
like a nerd from his face only.

...to prove his point...

1806
01:31:28,109 --> 01:31:29,442
...he can do anything.
