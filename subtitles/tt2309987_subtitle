That een l don't know where l am.

52
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:08,201
Let's make loe all
through the night.

53
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:12,295
From the body to the soul.

54
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:17,072
Let's become one.

55
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:32,423
Eyes lock in such a way.

56
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:40,397
lntoxication
courses through the body.

57
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:44,232
Whateer remaining sense there is.

58
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:48,766
Let's lose it.

59
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:52,306

66
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:08,286

00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,382
Cementec lnfra is gone.

110

What is it?

111
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:13,047
l hae told you so many times
not to stop me while l am jogging.

112
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:14,053
What happened?

113
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:15,419
Your father's call.

114
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:20,889
Sit in the car.

115
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,457
Yes, papa.

116
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,708
Papa.

117
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,585
From nothing l made eerything.

118
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:23,950
l started from zero.

119
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:27,591
And you.. are ruining my
well-established company.

120
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,093
Will you just stare at the newspaper?

121
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,464
Or will you say something too?

122
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:40,339
Sorry.. papa. l will do something.

123
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:43,273
This is not your bloody homework, Sid.

124
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,443
You will say sorry and do it again.

125
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:48,077
This is business.

126
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:56,145
You hae tarnished
our company's image.

127
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:05,966
Sorry, papa. l will.. fix it.

128
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:10,766
l think not only your tongue but
your mind has also started stuttering.

129
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:13,999
lf this problem is not
soled within the next 12 hours..

130
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:16,574
..from tomorrow your
brother will handle this company.

131
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:20,305
ln college you would get
pocket money eery month.

132
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,139
Same way take it from your mother.

133
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,082
l hope l am clear.

134
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,223
Yes, papa.

135
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:51,743
Sir. Sir.

136
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:04,385
Good morning, sir.

137
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:13,024
Hello, sir.
- Be seated.

138
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:16,259
See, Gurunath. There
will be high leel inquiry.

139
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:18,038
The judge is inoled in
this and has been exposed too.

140
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,573
Along with him the chairman of
the corporatie bank as well.

141
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:25,470
But we can sae ourseles.
lf you want.

142
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:27,175
How?

143
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:29,045
You will hae to issue a statement..

144
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,447
..that you hae done all this.

145
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:34,680
l mean, you acted on
your own indiidual accord.

146
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,154
And the company has
nothing to do with this.

147
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:37,850
What?

148
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:38,786
Look, Gurunath.

149
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:41,657
lt's futile to salage the
situation when it's too late.

150
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:44,121
At most you will be
behind bars for 15 days.

151
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,596
l will put the entire
legal department in your case.

152
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:49,062
You will be out in two weeks.

153
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:51,594
And now, l will make my offer to you.

154
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:54,397
lf you take the
entire blame on yourself..

155
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:56,777
..in today's date the
salary that you are drawing..

156
00:10:57,144 --> 00:10:58,441
..you will get it all your life.

157
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:00,637
Without doing any work.

158
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,640
Why are you thinking
so much, Gurunath?

159
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:05,083
lt's a good offer.

160
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,148

161
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:16,287
Cheers to you, Kaya.
- No. Cheers to Justice L.K. Shukla.

162
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:18,127
'l am solely responsible

163
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:21,657
'..between Justice L.K.
Shukla and me.'

164
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:22,430
Look. Look. Look.

165
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:23,265
'l took the bribe.'
- What?

166
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:24,463
lt's Gurunath on the TV?

167
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:26,665
Yes. CEO of Cementec lnfra.
- He is talking to the media.

168
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,231
'..didn't know anything about it.'

169
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:29,238
What is he saying?

170
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,837
'l accept my mistake. And
admit that l did all this.'

171
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,205
He turned out to be a holy coconut.

172
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:39,184
What? Holy coconut.
- Yes.

173
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:41,321
You are laughing?

174
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:42,583
Just see. All of them will escape.

175
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:45,490
l like this. l like this.
Holy coconut.

176
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,551
Who is calling me?
- 'l hae resigned today.'

177
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:49,855
What?

178
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,186
Hello.
- Nothing can happen in this country.

179
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:53,699
Congratulations.
- Thanks. Who is this?

180
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:55,668
The man whose company you hae ruined.

00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,811

00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,653

206
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,308
When l took oer the company,
my father told me..

207
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:48,537
..Son, if your enemy is remarkable,
befriend him.

208
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,612
Yes. You won't benefit anything.

209
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:54,516
But in the future the chances
of incurring losses reduce.

210
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:59,292
Okay. So you hae
brought me here for coffee..

211
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,987

00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:07,832
..you need talent for that.

214

And you hae it.

215
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:12,272
l don't want to
fight with your talent.

216
00:14:12,573 --> 00:14:13,835
ln fact, l want to use it.

217

Kaya.

229
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:59,943
You like only truth?
Or uneiling the truth?

230
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:03,119

237
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:27,739
..triple of that..

241
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:50,866
Coffee? Good.

242
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:56,099
He is not offering a job.
He is offering money.

243
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:59,105
Why do we work? For money, right?

244
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,740

You will miss only journalism?

248
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:16,754
Now you tell me clearly.

249
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,661
That you don't want me
to accept this job offer.

250
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,200

- Okay. Okay. Okay.

251
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:22,493

00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,531
l will miss you also a lot.

253
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:31,668
l am going away from journalism,

And this is for you.

259
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:54,032
Wow!
- lt has always shown me good times.

260
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:57,632
And l hope it shows
you good times too.

261
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:00,665
Thanks.

262
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,136
Kaya, are you sure your
information is correct?

263
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:38,604
Yes, boss.

264
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:41,872
l mean, this contract,
it's really important.

265
00:17:42,116 --> 00:17:43,981
Don't worry, boss. We
will get the contract.

266
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:45,848
But he has already gien the
contract to somebody else.

267
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,045
So how will that happen?

268
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,146
You don't trust me?

269
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:54,055
l trust your confidence completely.
- Thanks.

270
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:57,021
There is a difference
of 240 crores between..

271
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:59,565
..your quotation and
Uniersal Cement's quotation.

272
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,496
And you are still
telling me they are robbing us.

273
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,562
The logic is ery simple, Mr. Jai.

274
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,775
Uniersal Cement is
only one year old company.

275
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:12,607
Their promoters are the
stakeholders of RGV Cements..

276
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,875
..a bankrupt cement company.

277
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:17,648
After being blacklisted from
the international market..

278
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,879
..RGV Cements has shut down.

279
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:25,725
And the cement that you were
getting at 25% less price..

280
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:30,128
..actually nobody will buy it
from the market een for free.

281
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:31,790
Here is the proof.

282
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:35,968
RGV Cements is a sold,
bankrupt company.

283
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:39,536
Here please.

284
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:41,971
Look, Mr. Jai.

285
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:47,169
lf you negotiate a bit
more with Uniersal Cement..

286
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:51,617
..they might further
reduce the price by 25%.

287
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:55,816
You know, maybe een 50%.

288
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,757
Ms. Kaya.
- Yes, sir.

289
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:03,194
And Mr. Dhanrajgir.

290
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:05,257
We will get back to you.

291
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:14,604
Yes, Mr. Jai.

292
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,243
Surely.

293
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:19,611
Thank you, sir.

294
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,889
Sir, yeah.

295
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:42,265
Kaya, the contract.. we got it.

296
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:44,170
Really?

297
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,197
l am so sorry.

298
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:50,673
Well done, Kaya.

299
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:52,973

- Cheers.

306
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,239
Sorry.

307
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:05,716

309
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:28,137

00:26:08,722 --> 00:26:10,690
Jusleen, let her come.

362
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,485
Sid.

363
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:16,422
See? l told you.

364
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:19,688
What's wrong with them?

365
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:26,000
Sid.

366
00:26:34,814 --> 00:26:38,614
Your PA was saying
the management has..

367
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:41,518
..terminated my security card.

368
00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:49,219
What's going on?

369
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:53,098
The best thing about bad news is..

370
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:59,403
..that the person about whom
the news is, finds out last.

371
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:01,706
The way l found out.

372
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:05,101
About my company's scandal.

373
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:07,338
After reading your newspaper.

374
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:11,680
Sid.

375
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:16,486
lt's a.. it's a joke, right?

376
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:23,359
lt's not a joke. But l
do find it quite funny.

377
00:27:39,412 --> 00:27:40,572
Come.

378
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:06,301
l ** the people who ** me.

379
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,705
No. No. No, Sid.

380
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:20,719
Do you know why l
keep this gun with me?

381
00:28:22,856 --> 00:28:26,485
So that l can remind myself
that l hae the easiest way..

382
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,221
..of taking reenge in front of me.

383
00:28:29,396 --> 00:28:32,661
Shoot and end of the matter.

384
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,858
Right? lt's simple.

385
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:42,331
What can l gie you that is
worst and more terrifying than death?

386
00:28:45,478 --> 00:28:48,140
So this is my inspiration.

387
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:03,258
lf you want to ruin someone's life..

388
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:06,894
..it is important to keep him alie.

389
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:10,826
Death saes you from deastation.

390
00:29:11,438 --> 00:29:12,598
Right?

391
00:29:24,484 --> 00:29:25,542
Come.

392
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:28,619
Look. Look at yourself.

393
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:29,786
What did you think?

394
00:29:29,856 --> 00:29:32,256
One sting operation
will defame my company?

395
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:34,722
Look at me. Look at me.

396
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:42,600
Remember one thing, Kaya Krishna.

397
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:47,264
l am Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

398
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:52,411
And nobody ** with me.

399
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:56,877
Now get the ** out of my office.

400
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:04,915
** off.

401
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:33,616
Beloed.

402
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:41,516
Beloed.

403
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:47,928
Beloed.

404
00:30:50,670 --> 00:31:01,478
Loe is crying.

405
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:13,651
The grief of my soul
is wet on the eyelids.

406
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:20,698
You don't know how it is
to be treated callously.

407
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:27,330
You broke my glass like heart.

408
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:33,311
You broke my glass like heart.

409
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,643
You broke my glass like heart.

410
00:31:40,386 --> 00:31:45,722
Once the heart breaks,
it neer mends.

411
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:49,556
You don't know my pain.

412
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:52,621
Only the one who is hurt knows.

413
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:58,501
What is the price of my loe?

414
00:31:58,738 --> 00:32:02,538
You broke my glass like heart.

415
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:04,907
Hi. Got the job?

416
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:11,474
You broke my glass like heart.

417
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:18,350
What happened?

418
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:19,686
Kaya. Kaya.

419
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,421
Kaya.

420
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:44,378
Congrats. Your wife is pregnant.

421
00:32:45,018 --> 00:32:48,784
l trusted only you.

422
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:51,823
You turned back from your word.

423
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:57,955
The sky befell on me.

424
00:32:58,031 --> 00:33:04,027
l had kept the world at your feet.

425
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,697
You rejected me.

426
00:33:07,774 --> 00:33:10,402
Where do l go?

427
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:13,502
l don't understand anything.

428
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,549
l might lose my life.

429
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:22,213
Liing without you
is punishment for me.

430
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,652
Kaya.

431
00:33:29,028 --> 00:33:30,120
Kaya.

432
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:32,158
Kaya, stop.

433
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:33,624
Kaya, come back.

434
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,158
Kaya.

435
00:33:36,035 --> 00:33:37,161
Kaya.

436
00:33:58,224 --> 00:33:59,816
Kaya Krishna.

437
00:34:01,027 --> 00:34:02,756
You reached till here.

438
00:34:03,763 --> 00:34:05,196
l had forgotten you.

439
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:07,159
What's the matter? After a long time.

440
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,791
No news. No calls.

441
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:13,569
After today you won't forget me
for a minute, leae alone a day.

442
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:17,571
l can't hae such a big
reason to remember you.

443
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:22,539
You are ery proud of
your wealth, aren't you?

444
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,842
What if l snatch half of it?

445
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,153
Really?

446
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:37,722
You can't pluck a
strand of hair from my head.

447
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:40,164
Forget half my wealth.

448
00:34:43,302 --> 00:34:45,532
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

449
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:51,172
Just a strand of hair is
enough for the DNA test.

450
00:34:51,778 --> 00:34:53,939
The heir of half
your property, money..

451
00:34:54,714 --> 00:34:58,309
..and house is nurturing in my womb.

452
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,553
l am pregnant.

453
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:42,255
Hello.
- Kaya, this is Siddharth speaking.

454
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:46,560
How dare you call me?

455
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:48,156
Please listen to me for a minute.

456
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:51,069
We were forced to meet in
the circumstances we met.

457
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:53,363
You had caused me a loss.

458
00:35:53,606 --> 00:35:55,233
And l was not among
those who'll keep quiet.

459
00:35:55,308 --> 00:35:57,799
So l took reenge. Fair enough or not?

460
00:35:58,277 --> 00:36:01,246
But life is more important
that reenge and business.

461
00:36:01,914 --> 00:36:06,647
And now we hae lies
which none of us hate.

462
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:10,915
l want to apologise.

463
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:14,190
Kaya, l am really sorry.

464
00:36:15,728 --> 00:36:18,253
l really am. Kaya, are you there?

465
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:20,127
God...

466
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,964
Where are you?

467
00:36:49,929 --> 00:36:51,157
l am sorry.

468
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:56,834
Sid...Sid, l loe you
- l loe you too.

469
00:36:56,903 --> 00:36:59,201
Why did you do this to me?
- l am sorry. l am sorry.

470
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:03,333
l still loe you. l still...

471
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:11,146
What did l tell you?

472
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,682
l am Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

473
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:16,415
And nobody messes with me.

474
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:20,356
Take her away. Take her away.

475
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,386
Moe it.

476
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:07,462
Sister, make sure that
she can neer conceie.

477
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:23,717
Come on, get up. Get up.

478
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:25,418
Get up.

479
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:27,755
lt's been 24 hours since
you hae been lying here.

480
00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:29,452
Come on, get up. And get out of here.

481
00:38:29,528 --> 00:38:31,291
Someone else needs the bed.

482
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:35,790
And here. Some money.

483
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:37,469
They gae it for you.

484
00:38:38,104 --> 00:38:39,731
Get out of here.

485
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:27,945
While did you change the path.

486
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:30,921
Why hae you created a distance..

487
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:34,092
..of centuries
between us in an instance?

488
00:39:34,193 --> 00:39:40,189
You shattered my world of dreams.

489
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:46,305
Something has
slipped out of my hands.

490
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:52,468
Oh God, make me meet
someone who neer leaes me.

491
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:58,910
Oh God, make me meet
someone who neer leaes me.

492
00:39:58,985 --> 00:40:04,582
This separation from
the one l loe is bad.

493
00:40:05,057 --> 00:40:10,085
My fragile heart. You
hae broken my fragile heart.

494
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:16,831
My fragile heart. You
hae broken my fragile heart.

495
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:18,902
Come on, madam. Get down.

496
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:21,835
Get down. This is the last stop.

497
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:29,005
You can't put
together a broken heart.

498
00:40:29,982 --> 00:40:35,943
My loe.

499
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:41,359
O my loe.

500
00:40:42,995 --> 00:40:49,161
O my loe.

501
00:40:51,404 --> 00:40:52,666
Vicky..
- Kaya.

502
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:54,929
Kaya, where are you calling from?

503
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:55,473
Just a minute.

504
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,566
Kaya...Kaya, where are you?

505
00:40:57,643 --> 00:40:58,575
Kaya, tell me, dear.

506
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,294
What was wrong with me, Vicky?

507
00:41:58,037 --> 00:41:59,732
l had died, isn't it?

508
00:42:12,084 --> 00:42:14,678
Look into my eyes and tell the truth.

509
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:17,453
What was wrong with me?

510
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:21,554
Tell me.

511
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:27,632
You...can neer eer conceie, Kaya.

512
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:38,706
You were almost dead.

513
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:41,271
You hae returned from
the jaws of death, Kaya.

514
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:05,161
Kaya, when will you do the packing?

515
00:43:05,604 --> 00:43:09,040
All your things are
still lying scattered.

516
00:43:19,218 --> 00:43:21,209
Eeryone has come to know.

517
00:43:23,155 --> 00:43:25,589
The tongues hae started to wag.

518
00:43:26,592 --> 00:43:28,287
What are you going to do here?

519
00:43:31,063 --> 00:43:33,031
How will you surie?

520
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:37,227
Kaya, it is not right
to lie in Delhi any more.

521
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:39,364
Come on, dear.

522
00:43:40,406 --> 00:43:47,141
Mother, my body is not going to
change if l change the city, is it?

523
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:54,585
So should we assume that our
Kaya who went to the hospital..

524
00:43:55,754 --> 00:43:57,722
..neer returned from there?

525
00:43:58,857 --> 00:44:00,085
She died.

526
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,350
My parents hae already
said that l am dead to them.

527
00:45:10,462 --> 00:45:13,158
Am l alie to you?

528

You can't do this to me. Leae me.

532
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:20,956
Hey...

00:46:26,872 --> 00:46:28,931
Who the hell is she? Just look at her.

534
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:33,777
Translators : Milad Taherkhani & Mohammad Taherkhani

535
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:34,971

536
00:46:35,614 --> 00:46:40,517

684
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:49,064

685
01:00:50,401 --> 01:00:51,595

01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,675
And in the end him.

When you decide to exact
reenge from someone..

..you should dig up two
graes and not just one.

01:01:47,492 --> 01:01:52,429
Dead people are not

698
01:03:00,498 --> 01:03:01,795
Excuse me.

699
01:03:04,001 --> 01:03:05,832

But this will
benefit you in a big way.

723
01:04:19,577 --> 01:04:23,274
All the details are on this paper.

724
01:04:24,849 --> 01:04:28,649
And l feel four crores
is a ery small amount.

725
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:31,979
For this information
and for you as well.

726
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,726
Okay. Agreed that the
information is right.

727
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:43,961
What if l use this information and
don't gie you rupees four crores?

728
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:50,966
Mr. Tandon, l can

That's why l hae come to you.

730

What do you think?

732
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:06,386
l can't get more money from him.

733
01:05:10,027 --> 01:05:11,995
This is my bank account number.

734
01:05:26,544 --> 01:05:28,910
Oh. Sorry for the interruption.

735
01:05:30,748 --> 01:05:31,976

'Dhanraj Group is in trouble.'

The goernment has put a

746
01:06:22,099 --> 01:06:23,828
..inesting in the
cement sector for now.

How?

752
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:40,150
Father, l'll find out.

753
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:42,616
Either someone has
found ears in this office..

754
01:06:42,687 --> 01:06:44,518
..or you hae been
blurting out things.

755
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:49,057
Gie me 24 hours, father.

756
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:52,924
You haen't been able to learn to
talk properly with me in 24 years.

757
01:06:53,164 --> 01:06:55,758
So what are you
going to do in 24 hours?

758
01:07:07,612 --> 01:07:11,070
Rajdeep, you find out.

759
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:13,008

Who else could it be but you?

764
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:55,745
You know. You are not all that smart.

765
01:08:56,754 --> 01:08:58,949
l knew you were stubborn.

766
01:08:59,623 --> 01:09:04,253
But l had no idea you
were foolish as well.

767
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:14,203
Listen ery carefully,
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

768
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:19,740
When a woman gets down
to selling her honor..

769
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:25,705
..instead of saing it,
she can buy any man.

770
01:09:26,851 --> 01:09:31,015
Be it Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

771
01:09:38,662 --> 01:09:41,961
A cat's teeth are
sharper than that of a lion.

772
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,969
And the power lies in the paw.

773
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:08,719
So did you just hear the sound
or understood something as well?

774
01:10:13,264 --> 01:10:15,755
This has made me een more determined.

775

01:12:19,797 --> 01:12:21,662
Taking reenge has many benefits.

789
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,634
Did you buy this house? Or..

790
01:12:30,308 --> 01:12:31,502
..did someone gift it to you?

791
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:36,110

Where she goes, whom she meets..

801
01:13:35,873 --> 01:13:38,842

01:22:56,266 --> 01:22:58,734
Are you sure of the figures, Sid?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:59,136 --> 01:23:01,297
lt's confirmed information. Yeah.

905
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:09,878
The rate is good.

906
01:23:13,117 --> 01:23:14,175
This is our..

907
01:23:15,886 --> 01:23:18,354
..big comeback, papa.

908
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:25,227
Nowadays you are
busy in which project?

909
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:27,794
l don't like it anywhere without you.

910
01:23:28,765 --> 01:23:29,959
Een in office.

911
01:23:36,974 --> 01:23:39,807
You don't loe me.

912
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:48,345
With your lips and hands, yes.

913
01:23:49,553 --> 01:23:50,781
But..

914
01:23:52,322 --> 01:23:53,448
..not from your heart.

915
01:23:58,095 --> 01:24:01,326
ls being loyal to Siddharth
Dhanrajgir dearer to you..

916
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:04,964

917

What is Cementec's
new project? Tell me.

918
01:24:15,312 --> 01:24:17,280
lf you loe me..

919
01:24:18,849 --> 01:24:23,252
..why don't you tell
me about Cementec?

920
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:26,512
Why? What is their new project?

921
01:24:27,157 --> 01:24:29,523
What is their new deal? Tell me.

922
01:24:29,826 --> 01:24:30,918
Tell me.

923
01:24:35,599 --> 01:24:41,435
A dam is being built
at Biodiersity Park.

924
01:24:42,272 --> 01:24:43,830
lt's a big project.

925
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:47,410
Your boss is a bad businessman, Raj.

926
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:50,605
As long as l am there,
he won't get any tender..

927
01:24:52,616 --> 01:24:54,584
..leae alone this tender.

928
01:24:55,986 --> 01:24:58,614
Because the information that l
hae gien to Delhi Cements..

929
01:25:00,157 --> 01:25:03,354
..een Siddharth Dhanrajgir's
messiahs can't get hold of it.

930
01:25:05,629 --> 01:25:12,228
The major expenditure of the dam
that is being built is of stones.

931
01:25:12,302 --> 01:25:15,897
Stones costing 1500
crores are going to be used.

932
01:25:17,074 --> 01:25:20,441
lt's aailable at the park for free.

933
01:25:21,044 --> 01:25:23,137
The minister will take 200 crores.

934
01:25:24,548 --> 01:25:26,243
A profit of 1800 crores.

935
01:25:28,385 --> 01:25:32,151
Now guess, what is
Delhi Cements' new bid?

936
01:25:33,357 --> 01:25:36,451
Ask her, what is Delhi Cements' bid?

937
01:25:36,893 --> 01:25:38,588
Ask her. Come on,
you scoundrel. Ask her.

938
01:25:38,662 --> 01:25:40,493
What is Delhi Cements' bid?

939
01:25:44,668 --> 01:25:46,226
3500 crores.

940
01:25:46,536 --> 01:25:47,594
Yes!

941
01:25:54,211 --> 01:25:55,303
Papa..

942
01:25:56,913 --> 01:26:00,280
..now our bid is 3200 crores.

943
01:26:01,485 --> 01:26:06,320
Een if we gie the
minister 400 crores..

944
01:26:07,924 --> 01:26:10,119
..we will earn a profit of 800 crores.

945
01:26:13,697 --> 01:26:14,925
Are you sure?

946
01:26:17,367 --> 01:26:18,595
Absolutely, papa.

947
01:26:19,503 --> 01:26:23,234
Look, if you find a
single eidence against me..

948
01:26:24,007 --> 01:26:26,942
..l promise you that l
will leae politics..

949
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:29,342
..and become a social worker.
Fine? Jai Hind.

950
01:26:30,013 --> 01:26:31,105
Mr. Kumar.

951
01:26:31,682 --> 01:26:34,480
How are you?
- lt's your grace, Mr. Malhotra.

952
01:26:34,618 --> 01:26:35,710
Hae a seat.

953
01:26:36,553 --> 01:26:37,611
Tell me.

954
01:26:38,989 --> 01:26:40,217
Mr. Malhotra..

955
01:26:42,959 --> 01:26:45,450
..a dam is being built
at Biodiersity Park.

956
01:26:46,697 --> 01:26:48,460
Your cut is 400 crores.

957
01:26:50,534 --> 01:26:51,592
Look, Mr. Kumar.

958
01:26:52,035 --> 01:26:54,162
Whether you build a dam
there or somebody else.

959
01:26:55,005 --> 01:26:58,133
l am only concerned about deelopment.

960
01:27:01,044 --> 01:27:02,671
Mr. Mishra, tell me. Where
do l hae to sign? - Sir.

961
01:27:02,979 --> 01:27:04,173
Sign here.

962
01:27:06,183 --> 01:27:07,582
You hae checked, haen't you?

963
01:27:08,352 --> 01:27:10,115
Mr. Malhotra, one moment.
- Yes.

964
01:27:11,355 --> 01:27:15,724
lt's 400 crores because the
stones that will be used..

965
01:27:15,992 --> 01:27:18,256
..for the construction of the dam
is already aailable at the park.

966
01:27:21,098 --> 01:27:22,156
l understand.

967
01:27:24,067 --> 01:27:25,193
l will call you.

968
01:27:26,069 --> 01:27:29,095
Mr. Mishra will tell you
how to transfer the funds.

969
01:27:30,507 --> 01:27:33,499
Fine, Mr. Malhotra.
You will get the money.

970
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:35,769
Always a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Kumar.

971
01:27:36,012 --> 01:27:37,070
Thank you.

972
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:41,710
Yes, Mr. Mishra. Let's finish this.

973
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:47,448
Thank you, sir.

974
01:27:49,426 --> 01:27:51,360
Papa thought 400 crores is too much.

975
01:27:52,095 --> 01:27:53,323
But l thought it's quite less.

976
01:27:54,297 --> 01:27:56,197
ln business and politics conduct..

977
01:27:56,299 --> 01:27:57,766
..is more important than money.

978
01:27:59,436 --> 01:28:01,131
This contract is not
about only profit.

979
01:28:01,204 --> 01:28:02,330
lt's the question of my honor.

980
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:03,497
lt's a challenge for me.

981
01:28:06,643 --> 01:28:08,440
And l can't tolerate failure at all.

982
01:28:10,347 --> 01:28:11,541
Please keep that in mind.

983
01:28:32,669 --> 01:28:35,695
Yes, tell me.
- Papa, we hae got the contract.

984
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:40,699
l just.. l just signed the papers.
- Okay.

985
01:29:05,268 --> 01:29:07,168
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

986
01:29:07,771 --> 01:29:11,468
You had planted these
cameras in my house, right?

987
01:29:12,242 --> 01:29:14,403
To follow me round the clock.

988
01:29:15,479 --> 01:29:18,505
l ** those who ** with me.

989
01:29:18,782 --> 01:29:20,306
l hae learnt it from you.

990
01:29:20,617 --> 01:29:24,383
You lost the 400 crores
that you gae to the minister.

991
01:29:26,156 --> 01:29:28,181
And 1600 crores as well.

992
01:29:29,426 --> 01:29:34,420
Because in Biodiersity Park you
won't find stone worth een Re.1.

993
01:29:35,832 --> 01:29:40,326
Because l hae already diulged
this secret to your competitors.

994
01:29:41,571 --> 01:29:43,539
Now what will you tell your papa?

995
01:29:46,576 --> 01:29:50,239
Papa.. l hae..

996
01:29:51,815 --> 01:29:53,146
** up.

997
01:29:53,617 --> 01:29:55,847
** bitch.

998
01:30:01,558 --> 01:30:02,650
**
-

999
01:30:09,699 --> 01:30:11,360
Sir, you hae matchstick?

1000
01:30:11,668 --> 01:30:12,930
Sorry. l don't smoke.

1001
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,238
Let's go.

1002
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,569
Papa.

1003
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:56,569
Translators : Milad Taherkhani & Mohammad Taherkhani
WwW.TeH-MoviE.IN

1004
01:31:11,761 --> 01:31:12,955
Yes?

1005
01:31:14,698 --> 01:31:15,960
Kaya Krishna.

1006
01:31:17,734 --> 01:31:18,826
Yes.

1007
01:31:19,336 --> 01:31:21,531
l hae an arrest warrant for you.

1008
01:31:30,981 --> 01:31:32,448
What's my crime?

1009
01:31:33,516 --> 01:31:35,416
Murdering Rajde.

1010
01:31:44,628 --> 01:31:46,789
How?
- How?

1011
01:31:47,897 --> 01:31:49,865
Only you can say that
at the police station.

1012
01:31:51,267 --> 01:31:52,325
Shall we go?

1013
01:31:59,409 --> 01:32:01,001
Shall l come like this? Or..

1014
01:32:01,911 --> 01:32:02,969
..shall l wear something?

1015
01:32:05,982 --> 01:32:09,042
No. lt will be better if
you wear some clothes.

1016
01:32:16,593 --> 01:32:20,962
ln the murder case of
Cementec lnfra's CEO Rajde..

1017
01:32:21,031 --> 01:32:23,625
..Delhi's famous socialist
Kaya Krishna is going to be..

1018
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,998
..presented today at
Delhi's Patiala House court.

1019
01:32:26,069 --> 01:32:29,505
There is a tense atmosphere here.

1020
01:32:46,423 --> 01:32:47,947
Whether Rajde Singh
committed suicide..

1021
01:32:48,024 --> 01:32:50,356
..or he was murdered, that's a
different contention, My Lord.

1022
01:32:50,627 --> 01:32:54,393
But it's clear that my client
Kaya Krishna is being framed.

1023
01:32:54,698 --> 01:32:57,599
Because she is the same
Kaya Krishna who had exposed..

1024
01:32:57,667 --> 01:33:00,363
..Cementec lnfra and Justice L.K.
Shukla's bribery case.

1025
01:33:00,804 --> 01:33:02,669
At that time the CEO had to resign.

1026
01:33:02,739 --> 01:33:06,675
And the present CEO
was murdered, My Lord.

1027
01:33:06,843 --> 01:33:07,969
That's all, Your Honor.

1028
01:33:08,712 --> 01:33:09,838
Come, sir.

1029
01:33:12,082 --> 01:33:14,744
l admit Mr. Rajde
Singh committed suicide.

1030
01:33:15,118 --> 01:33:17,643
But he didn't commit
suicide willingly.

1031
01:33:17,887 --> 01:33:20,447
And to proe that l want the
permission to present this..

1032
01:33:20,523 --> 01:33:24,857
..suicide note written by Mr.
Rajde Singh and this DVD.

1033
01:33:24,928 --> 01:33:26,020
Permission granted.

1034
01:33:26,096 --> 01:33:30,032
l made a grae mistake that
l got influenced by Kaya..

1035
01:33:30,734 --> 01:33:33,100
..and l ruined my
personal and professional life.

1036
01:33:33,369 --> 01:33:35,030
Now Kaya has
started blackmailing me.

1037
01:33:35,839 --> 01:33:37,568
And she is forcing me to marry her.

1038
01:33:37,674 --> 01:33:39,801
Under these circumstances l
can't come in front of you.

1039
01:33:39,876 --> 01:33:41,138
That's why l am committing suicide.

1040
01:33:41,444 --> 01:33:43,105
And that's why l am
sending this recording.

1041
01:33:43,513 --> 01:33:46,004
Gorgeous. Gorgeous.

1042
01:33:49,953 --> 01:33:51,477
l loe you, Kaya.

1043
01:33:55,558 --> 01:33:58,152
On the basis of this
letter and the eidences..

1044
01:33:58,394 --> 01:34:02,797
..and the police inestigation,
the court orders Kaya Krishna..

1045
01:34:02,866 --> 01:34:06,768
..to be put behind bars for
a judicial remand of 14 days.

1046
01:34:06,936 --> 01:34:08,767
The court is adjourned.

1047
01:34:49,646 --> 01:34:51,637
Why did you hire such a CEO?

1048
01:34:53,817 --> 01:34:58,584
Papa.. what did l know what
he does in his personal life?

1049
01:34:58,822 --> 01:35:02,451
Find out, Sid. lt's
important to find out.

1050
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,552
You are running a
business of 10000 crores.

1051
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:11,896
Other's personal life can
finish off your professional life.

1052
01:35:12,569 --> 01:35:13,627
Understand?

1053
01:35:15,905 --> 01:35:17,736
And yes, this girl Kaya Krishna.

1054
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:19,508
She is the same girl who had done..

1055
01:35:19,576 --> 01:35:21,840
..a sting operation on
Cementec lnfra, isn't she?

1056
01:35:21,978 --> 01:35:23,104
l don't know.

1057
01:35:24,113 --> 01:35:26,547
Maybe. l don't know.

1058
01:35:31,187 --> 01:35:34,588
Sid, whateer is going on..

1059
01:35:35,825 --> 01:35:37,224
..a strange contract..

1060
01:35:38,061 --> 01:35:40,495
..wrong information,
Rajde's suicide..

1061
01:35:40,563 --> 01:35:42,053
..Kaya Krishna's arrest..

1062
01:35:44,033 --> 01:35:46,968
..are you doing something
that you shouldn't be doing?

1063
01:35:52,108 --> 01:35:53,200
No, papa.

1064
01:35:57,614 --> 01:35:58,911
Your stammering..

1065
01:36:00,717 --> 01:36:01,843
..has worsened.

1066
01:36:23,573 --> 01:36:26,701
An ex-journalist in a sex scandal.

1067
01:36:29,712 --> 01:36:32,112
These are not rumors.
These are eidences.

1068
01:36:33,082 --> 01:36:39,146
Now, entire Delhi is calling
you number one.. prostitute.

1069
01:36:44,827 --> 01:36:46,692
Say something in your defense.

1070
01:36:47,964 --> 01:36:50,899
Seeral men will come to help you.

1071
01:36:54,103 --> 01:36:56,128
My only problem is..

1072
01:36:57,607 --> 01:36:59,575
..is l can't decide..

1073
01:37:01,044 --> 01:37:02,636
..whether to lie or not.

1074
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,672
Because if l speak the truth,
then those people..

1075
01:37:05,748 --> 01:37:08,012
..for whom you are toiling so hard..

1076
01:37:08,985 --> 01:37:10,179
..all of them will be in prison.

1077
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,182
What nonsense are you talking!

1078
01:37:14,657 --> 01:37:16,887
That's why nonsense is being recorded.

1079
01:37:18,895 --> 01:37:20,954
l want to tell you
something off the record.

1080
01:37:21,764 --> 01:37:22,958
Will you listen?

1081
01:37:39,816 --> 01:37:43,308
The business of politics
and the politics of business.

1082
01:37:44,821 --> 01:37:46,220
Both are strange.

1083
01:37:47,290 --> 01:37:50,657
When the table turns, you neer know.

1084
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:58,623
She can't come here.
And l can't go there.

1085
01:38:00,636 --> 01:38:02,661
So how do l meet this lady?

1086
01:38:04,073 --> 01:38:07,668
Mr. Minister, there is
always a middle path in politics.

1087
01:38:47,784 --> 01:38:51,720
Politics is the second
oldest business in the world.

1088
01:38:53,122 --> 01:38:55,352
You know the first one.

1089
01:38:58,294 --> 01:39:00,854
After meeting you l hae understood..

1090
01:39:00,963 --> 01:39:02,863
..there isn't much
difference between the two.

1091
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:09,028
Thanks.

1092
01:39:10,373 --> 01:39:14,309
Tell me. - Entire Delhi is
saying l killed Rajde Singh.

1093
01:39:15,812 --> 01:39:20,306
But his death is
linked to the 400 crores..

1094
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:25,820
..that you took as bribe so that
Cementec gets the dam contract .

1095
01:39:25,988 --> 01:39:28,218
As far as l am concerned,
you are talking rubbish.

1096
01:39:30,726 --> 01:39:33,058
Yeah. - lf the entire city
talks the same nonsense..

1097
01:39:33,129 --> 01:39:35,154
..then lie also becomes truth.

1098
01:39:35,298 --> 01:39:38,324
Which lie is going to come true?

1099
01:39:39,869 --> 01:39:42,895
The facts that
Rajde told me about you.

1100
01:39:43,106 --> 01:39:44,767
One night prior to his death.

1101
01:39:45,174 --> 01:39:46,334
About what?

1102
01:39:47,343 --> 01:39:48,469
What did he say?

1103
01:39:50,046 --> 01:39:53,015
He said you and Siddharth
Dhanrajgir are together.

1104
01:39:53,249 --> 01:39:54,739
Theft. Corruption.

1105
01:39:55,051 --> 01:39:57,110
These scoundrels are robbing
the country with both hands.

1106
01:39:58,287 --> 01:39:59,754
He een said..

1107
01:40:01,257 --> 01:40:04,886
..l hae eidence.
And l will expose them.

1108
01:40:05,828 --> 01:40:09,161
Hold on. Eidence? What eidence?

1109
01:40:10,266 --> 01:40:14,396
l hae the opposition, media
and CBl to find the eidence.

1110
01:40:15,872 --> 01:40:20,036
ln the court l just hae to
say whateer Rajde told me.

1111
01:40:26,415 --> 01:40:32,115
There must be a reason
behind your sympathy for me.

1112
01:40:33,156 --> 01:40:36,557
We will be together
either in prison or outside.

1113
01:40:42,532 --> 01:40:44,227
lt's in your hand.

1114
01:40:47,503 --> 01:40:48,868
Just for tonight.

1115
01:40:50,907 --> 01:40:52,238
Tomorrow you will be released.

1116
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:53,967
Thank you.

1117
01:41:00,416 --> 01:41:01,974
You are ery cunning.

1118
01:41:03,486 --> 01:41:05,351
You hae used me so well.

1119
01:41:05,922 --> 01:41:07,321
But you are not cunning.

1120
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,987
What do you mean?
- l mean..

1121
01:41:10,993 --> 01:41:13,427
..you didn't use me till now.

1122
01:41:17,433 --> 01:41:18,491
Try me.

1123
01:41:28,277 --> 01:41:33,237
Trying is so much
harder than just doing it.

1124
01:41:37,053 --> 01:41:38,452
So tell me.

1125
01:41:40,523 --> 01:41:42,013
From where do we begin?

1126
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,852
lf you want..

1127
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:48,863
..you can remoe this.

1128
01:41:50,967 --> 01:41:57,065
And coer the police
file that has my name.

1129
01:42:00,977 --> 01:42:03,912
You hae uncoered so much.

1130
01:42:05,014 --> 01:42:08,609
lt's ery difficult for me to coer.

1131
01:42:10,419 --> 01:42:13,877
So let eerything remain coered.

1132
01:42:15,391 --> 01:42:16,915
Minister.

1133
01:42:25,234 --> 01:42:28,328
You can't do such a
small thing for me.

1134
01:42:33,442 --> 01:42:35,273
lt's not in my hand.

1135
01:42:36,646 --> 01:42:42,084
So l am also not in
your hand, Minister.

1136
01:42:47,523 --> 01:42:48,649
Done.

1137
01:42:50,393 --> 01:42:52,361
Promise.
- Promise.

1138
01:42:55,631 --> 01:42:57,064
There is one joy..

1139
01:43:00,469 --> 01:43:02,960
..that only you can gie me.

1140
01:43:03,339 --> 01:43:04,431
What?

1141
01:43:06,575 --> 01:43:10,511
Since childhood l
wanted to work in a bank.

1142
01:43:11,247 --> 01:43:13,215
You are the cabinet minister.

1143
01:43:14,083 --> 01:43:19,544
Nominate me for the
post of a bank's director.

1144
01:43:20,022 --> 01:43:22,456
And then l am all yours.
- That is..

1145
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,559
..beyond my power.

1146
01:43:27,963 --> 01:43:31,126
l thought you are the most
powerful man in this country.

1147
01:43:40,676 --> 01:43:42,644
You are a ery stubborn girl.

1148
01:43:44,347 --> 01:43:46,611
The name is llBl bank.

1149
01:43:47,416 --> 01:43:49,350
l will see what l can do about it.

1150
01:43:51,287 --> 01:43:55,724
llBl bank. Nominate me
for the post of a director.

1151
01:43:56,992 --> 01:43:59,256
Okay. l will do it. lt's done.

1152
01:44:11,774 --> 01:44:13,264
Good morning, members.

1153
01:44:13,342 --> 01:44:14,536
Good morning.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

1154
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,414
lf all the members
hae come, shall we begin?

1155
01:44:23,018 --> 01:44:24,315
Where is Mr. Khosla?

1156
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:28,012
Sir, the nominee of llBl bank Mr.
Khosla resigned yesterday.

1157
01:44:28,457 --> 01:44:30,448
A new member is
coming in his place, sir.

1158
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:32,391
Who is the new member?

1159
01:44:32,461 --> 01:44:34,395
Sir, l got the fax from
the ministry just now.

1160
01:44:34,630 --> 01:44:36,791
He has not mentioned the name.
- Okay.

1161
01:44:37,299 --> 01:44:38,596
Let's start.
- Let's start. Yeah.

1162
01:44:39,034 --> 01:44:40,331
Okay.

01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:50,678
Hi Kumar. Where do l sit?

1165
01:44:50,746 --> 01:44:54,842
What...What the hell are
you doing...This is my board.

1166
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:58,281
Get out.
- Sid. Sit.

1167
01:44:58,754 --> 01:45:01,222
Kumar, where do l sit?

1168
01:45:01,824 --> 01:45:04,452
Ms. Kaya Krishna. Please.

1169
01:45:06,162 --> 01:45:07,254
Hello gentlemen.

1170
01:45:15,738 --> 01:45:19,196
Okay members. The first
point of the agenda is...

1171
01:45:19,275 --> 01:45:20,640
Kumar, all this can wait.

1172
01:45:23,078 --> 01:45:25,546
Gentlemen, l hae some points.

1173
01:45:25,614 --> 01:45:27,104
What the hell are your points?

1174
01:45:30,219 --> 01:45:31,311
Sid.

1175
01:45:38,093 --> 01:45:39,822
The annual general meeting
is to be held next week.

1176
01:45:40,196 --> 01:45:42,164
And l know nothing about the company.

1177
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:43,755
You know l hae joined today itself.

1178
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,664
So l want the access to
password of the company accounts..

1179
01:45:46,769 --> 01:45:50,432
..balance sheets and all the files.
- What?

1180
01:45:53,209 --> 01:45:54,369
l want it now.

1181
01:45:54,443 --> 01:45:57,310
This is ridiculous.
Father, this is our company.

1182
01:45:57,379 --> 01:46:00,348
This outsider can't come
and dictate terms to us.

1183
01:46:00,416 --> 01:46:01,508
Sid..

1184
01:46:02,384 --> 01:46:04,818
Kumar, l am waiting.

1185
01:46:10,426 --> 01:46:15,125
Yes, Ms. Kaya Krishna. Sure.
- Thanks.

1186
01:46:15,464 --> 01:46:20,128
Jasleen, gie her any files,
balance sheets or password she wants.

1187
01:46:20,336 --> 01:46:21,462
Okay sir.

1188
01:46:21,537 --> 01:46:24,938
The next meeting will be held
once l study all the papers.

1189
01:46:25,841 --> 01:46:27,866
Kumar, l'll let you
know when l am ready.

1190
01:46:30,513 --> 01:46:34,847
Sorry, gentlemen. Hae
a nice day. You too.

1191
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:57,799
Siddharth...

1192
01:47:05,681 --> 01:47:08,172
one of our CEOs is behind bars.

1193
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:09,478
And the other one is dead.

1194
01:47:10,619 --> 01:47:14,885
We hae suffered a loss of 1000
crore rupees in the dam project.

1195
01:47:15,257 --> 01:47:19,887
And today a prostitute of Delhi
is calling me by my first name.

1196
01:47:19,962 --> 01:47:23,363
Who? Your father.

1197
01:47:24,466 --> 01:47:27,993
A prostitute is
talking to Kumar Dhanrajgir.

1198
01:47:32,441 --> 01:47:34,272
She is now a board member.

1199
01:47:36,312 --> 01:47:37,745
l am asking you, Siddharth.

1200
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:45,250
How did she get this far? And why?

1201
01:47:50,359 --> 01:47:54,352
Father, it was necessary
to teach her a lesson..

1202
01:47:54,563 --> 01:47:56,656
..after her sting operation.

1203
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:03,329
But she got pregnant
and started blackmailing.

1204
01:48:04,506 --> 01:48:06,235
Are you a freaking idiot?

1205
01:48:08,677 --> 01:48:09,939
Don't you hae brains?

1206
01:48:13,015 --> 01:48:15,040
This is the last time l
am telling you something.

1207
01:48:16,785 --> 01:48:17,945
Listen carefully.

1208
01:48:21,757 --> 01:48:25,454
Sid, business is meant
only for earning money.

1209
01:48:26,061 --> 01:48:28,052
Not to exact reenge.

1210
01:48:29,632 --> 01:48:32,430
You are losing
eerything in a fight with a girl.

1211
01:48:32,501 --> 01:48:36,938
What the hell hae you done? Why?

1212
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:44,911
l promise, father. l'll
fix eerything this time.

1213
01:48:48,584 --> 01:48:50,916
lf anything goes wrong
on the day of the AGM..

1214
01:48:52,321 --> 01:48:54,016
..Cementec lnfra will be finished.

1215
01:48:55,724 --> 01:48:58,818
l hae to take care of
11 more companies, Sid.

1216
01:49:02,031 --> 01:49:09,335
l really hope, my son. Whateer
you are saying doesn't happen.

1217
01:49:24,653 --> 01:49:26,120
Just...Just see these papers.

1218
01:49:26,488 --> 01:49:27,580
See...

1219
01:49:28,624 --> 01:49:32,720
l know there are facts in these
papers that can ruin Siddharth.

1220
01:49:33,095 --> 01:49:35,063
And l want you to help me out. Please.

1221
01:49:37,032 --> 01:49:40,468
Vicky, are you een listening?

1222
01:49:41,603 --> 01:49:42,729
Vicky...

1223
01:49:45,441 --> 01:49:48,672
Why don't you sleep with
a chartered accountant?

1224
01:49:49,712 --> 01:49:52,681
He'll explain to you what's
hidden in these papers. - What?

1225
01:49:52,712 --> 01:49:56,333
Translators : Milad Taherkhani & Mohammad Taherkhani

1226
01:49:56,418 --> 01:50:01,856
Vicky. Wait. Listen to me.
Darn it. What are you saying?

1227
01:50:04,893 --> 01:50:09,660
Vicky, it neer mattered
what eeryone thinks about me.

1228
01:50:10,632 --> 01:50:13,430
But you know the truth, don't you?

1229
01:50:13,635 --> 01:50:15,603
You know what had happened to me.

1230
01:50:17,406 --> 01:50:18,498
What had happened?

1231
01:50:20,743 --> 01:50:22,108
Eery time it's about you.

1232
01:50:23,112 --> 01:50:24,807
As if there is no
one else in this world.

1233
01:50:25,047 --> 01:50:26,446
There are many like me.

1234
01:50:27,483 --> 01:50:30,884
But not eeryone fights.
l am fighting.

1235
01:50:30,953 --> 01:50:32,045
Fighting what?

1236
01:50:32,855 --> 01:50:34,584
You hae sold yourself.

1237
01:50:34,656 --> 01:50:38,717
You are forgetting, Vicky. l
was sold in the town square.

1238
01:50:38,794 --> 01:50:41,422
No. lt was your choices.

1239
01:50:42,698 --> 01:50:45,531
Working with him. Loing him.

1240
01:50:46,468 --> 01:50:47,560
And now reenge from him.

1241
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:50,561
You neer asked me
before doing anything.

1242
01:50:51,206 --> 01:50:52,673
l am leaing this city.

1243
01:50:57,079 --> 01:51:00,571
New city. New people and a new world.

1244
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:29,577
l always felt that you
would neer leae me alone.

1245
01:51:35,083 --> 01:51:37,574
You should'e at least
told me that you are going.

1246
01:51:41,256 --> 01:51:42,917
l am your friend, Vicky.
- You were my friend.

1247
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:46,521
You are not the Kaya l knew.

1248
01:51:47,963 --> 01:51:49,260
You hae killed her.

1249
01:51:49,965 --> 01:51:51,728
What has changed between us, Vicky?

1250
01:51:52,734 --> 01:51:53,792
Eerything.

1251
01:51:55,871 --> 01:51:58,635
You hae finished me
along with Siddharth.

1252
01:51:59,608 --> 01:52:01,007
Brick by brick.

1253
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:07,171
l. How?

1254
01:52:09,751 --> 01:52:11,275
Because l loed you. Darn it.

1255
01:52:37,145 --> 01:52:38,203
Since when?

1256
01:52:47,522 --> 01:52:53,552
l loed you when l saw
you for the first time.

1257
01:52:56,098 --> 01:52:59,864
l loed you the day
you went to Mumbai.

1258
01:53:01,203 --> 01:53:04,536
l loed you when you
returned from there.

1259
01:53:05,574 --> 01:53:10,204
l loed you een when you
threw away my watch as garbage.

1260
01:53:10,846 --> 01:53:15,783
l loed you een you slept with
eery man who was helping you.

1261
01:53:19,655 --> 01:53:21,122
l loe you een today.

1262
01:53:23,125 --> 01:53:25,958
l just don't feel like
seeing you any more.

1263
01:53:26,895 --> 01:53:28,055
l can't look at you any more.

1264
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:38,305
Vicky.
- Just leae, Kaya. Just go.

1265
01:53:40,309 --> 01:53:41,571
Just leae me alone.

1266
01:53:43,045 --> 01:53:49,245
While did you change the path.

1267
01:53:49,318 --> 01:53:52,287
Why hae you created a distance..

1268
01:53:52,354 --> 01:53:55,323
..of centuries
between us in an instance?

1269
01:53:55,390 --> 01:54:01,659
You shattered my world of dreams.

1270
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:07,726
Something has
slipped out of my hands.

1271
01:54:07,803 --> 01:54:13,969
Oh God, make me meet
someone who neer leaes me.

1272
01:54:14,042 --> 01:54:19,981
This separation from
the one l loe is bad.

1273
01:54:20,048 --> 01:54:25,281
My fragile heart. You
hae broken my fragile heart.

1274
01:54:26,188 --> 01:54:31,922
My fragile heart. You
hae broken my fragile heart.

1275
01:54:32,327 --> 01:54:38,630
My fragile heart. You
hae broken my fragile heart.

1276
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:44,195
You can't put
together a broken heart.

1277
01:55:00,055 --> 01:55:03,286
l pushed leaing two days back.
- Why?

1278
01:55:04,659 --> 01:55:07,787
Because you can fall
in loe number of times.

1279
01:55:09,031 --> 01:55:10,692
But you can't hae
friendship again and again.

1280
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:14,728
But for the last time.

1281
01:55:18,740 --> 01:55:19,866
Tell me. What do l hae to do?

1282
01:55:20,042 --> 01:55:22,772
l am finding this paper bit fishy.

1283
01:55:23,311 --> 01:55:24,403
Hae a look at it.

1284
01:55:31,453 --> 01:55:35,321
Cementec lnfra bought their
first mini cement plant in 2006.

1285
01:55:36,425 --> 01:55:40,452
There is a illage
Naya Majra. lts there.

1286
01:55:41,096 --> 01:55:44,930
And this year's
electricity bill is Rs. 28,00,000.

1287
01:55:47,069 --> 01:55:49,867
They imported a
packaging plant in 2006.

1288
01:55:50,705 --> 01:55:52,468
And the electricity
bill is Rs. 42,00,000.

1289
01:55:53,775 --> 01:55:55,003
All fine till here.

1290
01:55:56,211 --> 01:56:01,945
After this, in 2008,
Cementec imported two mini plants.

1291
01:56:02,484 --> 01:56:04,349
The electricity bill
should'e been three times.

1292
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:06,114
Bu that didn't happen.

1293
01:56:07,122 --> 01:56:10,785
The electricity bill dropped
from 42,00,000 to 40,00,000.

1294
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:14,987
ln 2009 and 2010, they imported
three plants more respectiely.

1295
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:17,964
And do you know much the
electricity bill dropped to?

1296
01:56:19,968 --> 01:56:21,060
Rs. 4,00,000.

1297
01:56:21,136 --> 01:56:23,969
You mean to say there
has been electricity theft.

1298
01:56:24,172 --> 01:56:25,366
No, Kaya.

1299
01:56:26,274 --> 01:56:29,368
All these cements
plants are only on paper.

1300
01:56:30,245 --> 01:56:33,737
That means it's all a big scam.

1301
01:56:52,334 --> 01:56:55,064
All these cement factories and
eerything is just on paper.

1302
01:56:55,770 --> 01:56:58,238
And there has been a subsidy
scam of billions of rupees.

1303
01:56:58,874 --> 01:57:00,102
Shareholders didn't get anything.

1304
01:57:00,175 --> 01:57:02,575
But Siddharth Dhanrajgir's
bank accounts kept increasing.

1305
01:57:03,945 --> 01:57:06,971
All these foreign accounts and
money is all rooted to Mauritius.

1306
01:57:07,349 --> 01:57:09,874
And they themseles
raise their share prices.

1307
01:57:11,353 --> 01:57:13,981
Come on, Vicky. Let's go.
- Yes.

1308
01:57:30,472 --> 01:57:32,872
Yet another plot of
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

1309
01:57:33,275 --> 01:57:35,140
There is a board. But no factory.

1310
01:57:37,245 --> 01:57:41,238
When this news breaks, Siddharth
Dhanrajgir will be behind bars.

1311
01:57:42,517 --> 01:57:45,509
Yes. Tomorrow after the AGM.

1312
01:57:48,223 --> 01:57:51,056
Mr. Shashtri, Kaya
has got to my boardroom.

1313
01:57:51,259 --> 01:57:52,920
But she mustn't get to the AGM.

1314
01:57:54,095 --> 01:57:55,585
Do whateer it takes.

1315
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:59,061
Mr. Siddharth, don't worry.
She won't get there.

1316
01:58:06,208 --> 01:58:13,546
Drier. Drier...what...

1317
01:58:46,014 --> 01:58:48,380
Ask her not to go there. Speak.
Speak, you rascal.

1318
01:58:48,450 --> 01:58:52,216
Kaya, don't stop. Just go that AGM.

1319
01:58:53,355 --> 01:58:55,152
Beat him. Beat the rascal. Beat him.

1320
01:58:58,193 --> 01:58:59,990
Did you watch your
friend's ideo, Kaya Krishna?

1321
01:59:00,462 --> 01:59:01,929
Do l need to tell you
what you hae to do next?

1322
01:59:01,997 --> 01:59:03,055
Or you hae understood?

1323
01:59:03,398 --> 01:59:05,593
l must not see you
anywhere close to the AGM. Got it?

1324
01:59:06,468 --> 01:59:10,131
l will call up again as to
what you hae to do next and how.

1325
01:59:10,538 --> 01:59:14,474
And one more thing.
- Sir... Sir, please.. Sir... Sir.

1326
01:59:17,078 --> 01:59:19,273
lf you mess with me today,
you know what l'll do.

1327
01:59:19,347 --> 01:59:23,181
Sir, what are you plans?
- Sir...sir.

1328
01:59:25,954 --> 01:59:27,353
Siddharth!

1329
01:59:32,093 --> 01:59:33,560
My dear shareholders.

1330
01:59:33,995 --> 01:59:36,190
lt gies me great
pleasure to welcome to the..

1331
01:59:36,264 --> 01:59:39,199
..7th Annual general
meeting of Cementec lnfra.

1332
01:59:39,434 --> 01:59:42,130
This year has proed
to be our golden year.

1333
01:59:42,971 --> 01:59:46,134
My son Siddharth has
finalised Mumbai's deal.

1334
01:59:47,475 --> 01:59:50,467
So it's natural that we
gift our shareholders.

1335
01:59:51,313 --> 01:59:55,147
So the management
has decided. 1 :1 bonus.

1336
01:59:55,717 --> 01:59:57,708
And 50% diidend.

1337
02:00:01,156 --> 02:00:04,455

02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:22,732
Till the AGM goes on, keep the
rascal alie. - Yes sir. Yes sir.

1341
02:00:22,977 --> 02:00:24,706
And then... kill him.

02:00:26,047 --> 02:00:27,537
Thank you. Thank you.

1343
02:00:28,083 --> 02:00:29,175
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1344
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:31,411

1346
02:00:38,193 --> 02:00:41,026

02:01:06,821 --> 02:01:09,085
He is running away. Get him. Get him.

1350
02:01:15,764 --> 02:01:17,595
Get him. Get him.

1351
02:01:22,270 --> 02:01:23,396
Don't let him go.
- Shoot him.

1352
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:31,278
He is running away.
What are you doing?

1353
02:01:34,215 --> 02:01:36,206
Shoot him down.

1354
02:01:56,104 --> 02:01:58,538
Get him. Get him.

1355
02:02:08,483 --> 02:02:10,542
He is up there. See. There he goes.

1356
02:02:21,196 --> 02:02:22,356
Get him.

1357
02:02:25,166 --> 02:02:26,724
Quick. Come on.

1358
02:03:25,193 --> 02:03:26,490
Can l make a call?
- Sure.

1359
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:33,961
Vicky, where are you?

1360
02:03:34,202 --> 02:03:35,362
Kaya, l am fine.

1361
02:03:35,436 --> 02:03:37,836
Go to the AGM. l am fine.

1362
02:03:37,906 --> 02:03:39,464
l want to meet you right now.

1363
02:03:39,741 --> 02:03:42,175
Don't be foolish. Go to the AGM.

1364
02:03:42,243 --> 02:03:44,234
Are you sure? Are you okay?

1365
02:03:44,312 --> 02:03:46,610
l am absolutely fine. Go to the AGM.

1366
02:03:51,452 --> 02:03:52,646
Thank you. Thank you.

1367
02:03:54,455 --> 02:03:56,821
Thank you.
- Excuse me, Mr. Dhanrajgir.

1368
02:03:56,891 --> 02:03:59,451
The company you were
operating out of lndia last year.

1369
02:03:59,527 --> 02:04:00,653
What happened about it?

1370
02:04:00,728 --> 02:04:02,389
Yes. We are ery much on track.

1371
02:04:02,597 --> 02:04:05,998
Goernment of Malaysia has gien
green light to our packaging plant.

1372
02:04:07,502 --> 02:04:11,233
Now the tagline of Cementec
lnfra will not be building lndia..

1373
02:04:13,975 --> 02:04:15,499
..but building Asia.

1374
02:04:22,350 --> 02:04:25,251
And where will the cement be
manufactured, Mr. Dhanrajgir?

1375
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:26,412
l can't see you.

1376
02:04:26,588 --> 02:04:29,455
Yes, we are
importing three new plants.

1377
02:04:29,524 --> 02:04:32,857
And would it be wrong to
say that these three plants..

1378
02:04:32,927 --> 02:04:34,394
..will also run without electricity?

1379
02:04:35,663 --> 02:04:38,928
As the other plants of Cementec run.

1380
02:04:39,534 --> 02:04:42,526
Because all these cement
plants are only on paper.

1381
02:04:42,904 --> 02:04:47,000
l hae electricity bills of
Cementec lnfra's cement factories.

1382
02:04:48,776 --> 02:04:53,440
ln the last four years, as the
production in these plants increased..

1383
02:04:53,514 --> 02:04:55,004
..the electricity bill dropped.

1384
02:04:55,817 --> 02:04:57,045
Here is the proof.

1385
02:04:57,285 --> 02:04:58,445
Distribute please.

1386
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,983
After looting lndians..

1387
02:05:02,056 --> 02:05:05,514
..Siddharth Dhanrajgir is
now going to loot Asians.

1388
02:05:06,327 --> 02:05:07,453
Great.

1389
02:05:07,662 --> 02:05:09,527
He is fooling us. He is fooling us.

1390
02:05:09,797 --> 02:05:10,923
Sorry, gentlemen.

1391
02:05:11,299 --> 02:05:13,062
l am Kaya Krishna. Board member.

1392
02:05:13,301 --> 02:05:14,461
Representing lRBl bank.

1393
02:05:14,535 --> 02:05:16,833
Yes. Kaya Krishna.

1394
02:05:17,071 --> 02:05:19,403
Delhi's famous call girl.

1395
02:05:21,909 --> 02:05:25,743
What...is he saying.
- Tell us. Tell us.

1396
02:05:25,813 --> 02:05:28,782
Yes. And this is
Cementec lnfra's owner.

1397
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:30,283
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

1398
02:05:30,351 --> 02:05:32,478
And these are Cementec lnfra's shares.

1399
02:05:32,553 --> 02:05:35,852
And these are now no more
than scraps just like him.

1400
02:05:38,626 --> 02:05:44,997
And the bonus you are getting is
not bonus. lt is bogus like him.

1401
02:05:45,299 --> 02:05:46,459
Shut up. Just shut up.

1402
02:05:47,735 --> 02:05:50,397
Cementec lnfra is just a name.

1403
02:05:50,571 --> 02:05:51,868
Not an industry.

1404
02:05:52,306 --> 02:05:55,969
Just Siddharth Dhanrajgir is a
fraud and not a businessman.

1405
02:05:56,044 --> 02:06:00,003
Wait. Wait. She
gathers fake eidences.

1406
02:06:00,381 --> 02:06:03,680
She defames decent
people and blackmails them.

1407
02:06:03,818 --> 02:06:06,753
Tell us the truth.
- She does this.

1408

1409
02:06:10,458 --> 02:06:11,857
You don't hae any proof of this.

Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.

1411

02:06:23,471 --> 02:06:24,699
Siddharth, no.

02:08:16,083 --> 02:08:20,486
l am forced to chuck you out
of the other companies as well.

1439
02:08:21,155 --> 02:08:23,851
l can't take the risk of

1440
02:08:25,126 --> 02:08:27,219
Father...

1450
02:10:42,029 --> 02:10:47,296
lt's necessary to keep the person
alie in order to ruin his life.

1451
02:10:48,903 --> 02:10:50,871
Death saes you from destruction.

1452
02:10:53,641 --> 02:10:54,938

1453

Now my time is changing for the good.

1456
02:11:13,661 --> 02:11:14,958
You were right.

1457
02:11:15,696 --> 02:11:18,722

02:11:18,799 --> 02:11:20,733
..from a rascal like you.

1459

The police are

02:11:38,786 --> 02:11:41,186
