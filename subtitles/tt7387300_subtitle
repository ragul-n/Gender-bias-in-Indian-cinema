1
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,637
How cleverly you ditched me

2
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,041
-What's your name?
- Priya

3
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,583
Not related in any way

4
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,586
Simple?
Okay, then salute

5
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,758
Hey boy!

6
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,472
Fun?
Then say so!

7
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,327
- Go on, march
- Just come along

8
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,041
Feroze from Pattikkad

9
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,230
Guruvayur?

10
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,607
Will you ask for salutes hereafter?

11
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,750
We'll meet again
Study well!

12
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,687
I played a trick on them
I felt a little sad foryou

13
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,295
'Gadha Jam' as in that old movie?

14
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,105
Like the famous poet
Vayalar Ramavarma penned

15
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,661
Hearing his speech
even the mike ridiculed him

16
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:48,798
Our alumni and their band 'Chumaduthangi'
will present a musical program now

17
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,587
Whatever...it's a pain

18
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:36,386
"A flower like a rare pearl priceless"

19
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,879
"ln Mecca the Holy city"

20
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:53,663
"She led a life of royalty"

21
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:04,307
"Khadija Bibi was rich and famous"

22
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:16,586
"She led a life of regality"

23
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:49,568
"With Muhammad, laterthe prophet
on a trading expedition she went"

24
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:58,810
"With destined delight
she fell in love at first sight"

25
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,725
"Our prophet returned to Mecca happily"

26
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:35,470
"She proposed marriage to Him"

27
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:41,330
"A flower like a rare pearl priceless"

28
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:50,389
"ln Mecca the Holy city"

29
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,365
"She led a life of regality"

30
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:35,986
Show it to me

31
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,376
Yes, I'm in love

32
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,125
100% she'll be
in science group

33
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,213
Where are you going?

34
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,781
Ajit, just leave this
in my classroom

35
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,025
I will run to her and
share her umbrella

36
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,688
Sana and I, close and cosy
sharing an umbrella... oh!

37
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,933
Which vagabond
discovered the raincoat!

38
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,524
-Ahaa! Thanks
-Why?

39
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,672
Bro

40
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,039
You aren't that wet!

41
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,429
Get lost!

42
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,658
Back from church so soon?

43
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,121
- I never went
- Then?

44
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,892
Will it click?

45
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,950
Aiyo! I don't want any guy now

46
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,971
- Gadha?
- Sana

47
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,573
Not sitting
Look...standing

48
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,442
Now you knowthey can
choose commerce also?

49
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,224
Priya
She's already mine

50
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,986
Bro, listen

51
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,321
If you want a classroom full of girls
go join a girls' school

52
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,747
Universal vagabond!

53
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,545
Yes, she is my Malar miss

54
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,652
Hi students
I am Sneha

55
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,889
Do you have a boyfriend, teacher?

56
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,696
I'll tell you about
my love life, okay?

57
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,620
I studied till 10th in US
I come from Kunnamkulam

58
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,073
Hi, I'm Gadha John
I studied in Little Flowers school

59
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,507
- 1st you must befriend her
- Okay

60
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,848
Then you can get to the veiled one

61
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,967
Isn't it Maths, sir?

62
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,136
...
et me give you
some free advice, okay?

63
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,872
For example, I scored 90%
in my under grad exam

64
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,959
When he had failed his exams
and was broke as well

65
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,796
No, my gold bracelet

66
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:30,713
My... Nivin Pauly
As good as a brotherto me

67
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,520
He'll die for me
So affectionate

68
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,626
'All humbug'

69
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,761
All that is just style
A part oftinsel world

70
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,146
-Hi
-Hi

71
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,971
She's here somewhere

72
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,618
- Hello
- Take off your hand

73
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,542
From yesterday, on first sight
he has been badly besotted

74
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,470
I can tell you her name

75
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,331
Then I am in no mood
to tell you her name

76
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,132
lam Vyshak Pavana
Pavana to close friends

77
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,525
What is this!?

78
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,730
Gadhu, see you later

79
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,155
- What is it?
- Nothing

80
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,024
lneverthought we would
get close like this so soon

81
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,132
You must have imagined it

82
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,617
Aren't you eating, bro?

83
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,210
Blocked me on WhatsApp too

84
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,039
You have nothing to do now
Principal will do the needful

85
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,215
Bro, 2 'parotta'

86
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,662
God! Kissing?!

87
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,694
Not everyone will
be in control like me

88
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,524
Where are you going?
You sit right there

89
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,082
He does something dirty
And he can tell you

90
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,505
Oh come on! You liked it
Isn't that why you told everyone?

91
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,934
What a fraud you are!

92
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,755
I will never fall in love with you

93
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,177
"He wants to make the girl
feel the love for his own story"

94
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,427
"Oh my God! Kaput now
Fell head over heels in love"

95
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,111
"A fleeting smile from herwill do
My heart beats a wild tattoo"

96
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:59,423
"From her lips when the word 'hate' slipped
the entire sea into darkness dipped"

97
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,634
"First time it is boring
Next time you will get the feeling"

98
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,164
"0' girl, full of fun and freaky
Come with me, Ms Wacky"

99
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,219
"When you sing along with me
life will be jolly, baby"

100
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,802
"If you come away with me
life will be jolly, baby"

101
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,404
"My dear girlie!"

102
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,475
"le dear dolly"

103
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,586
"First bus whizzed past me
2nd bus too raced past in a jiffy"

104
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,687
"And then she arrived finally
Bedecked in blue with fancy finery"

105
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,232
"In spite of the trouble to be well dressed
Not even a 2nd glance was I blessed"

106
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,788
"Bro, wonderful feeling"

107
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,180
"It's the time to break it
Life is sothrilling, right?"

108
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,376
"0' girl, weird and freaky
Sing along with me"

109
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,614
"0' girl, full of fun and freaky
Come with me, Ms Wacky"

110
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,257
"0' girl, weird and freaky
Sing along with me"

111
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,664
"le dear baby!"

112
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,506
He wrote that song
'Freak Penne'

113
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,642
- Not allowed
- Listen!

114
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,722
When our lyricists are trying to
raise our songs to international level...

115
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,802
...l'll gouge your eyes
Now clear out!

116
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,988
Who is that boy
not in school uniform?

117
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,849
We seniors wear uniform
Then why can't you?

118
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,373
Go home and wear
your uniform and come

119
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,716
I'm a guest teacher

120
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,866
Can't blame the boys
Look at your attire

121
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,097

 forgot to ask your name
when I met you in the office

122
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,626
Biology

123
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,116
-What is your name?
- Manikandan

124
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:50,218
I'm the Principal's elder son's
elder sister's younger brother's son!

125
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,629
That means he is
Principal's aunt's son

126
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,809
Will you misunderstand
ifl ask you something?

127
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,659
Are you and Roshan in love?

128
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,585
Gadha, can! ask you something?

129
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,779
I simply told Shaan
Roshan and l are in love

130
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,599
-Youthink he'll tell me?
- Then why did you ask me?

131
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,112
Nothing, eat your puff

132
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,113
An angel

133
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,114
How do you know my brother?

134
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,200
We must kill him
Kill that fatso

135
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,595
You didn't?

136
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,186
Who is the liar?
Didn't you ask me?

137
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,750
You get lost, fishmonger Mary

138
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,513
Take it if you want

139
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,327
If you can't afford chocolates
why do you come to school?

140
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,990
Don't become stingy
befriending such poor souls

141
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,556
We'll find a way

142
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,055
Be quiet, idiot
That gas bag Shibu will come

143
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,083
Think ofthe devil
Here he is... the butcher

144
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,993
Free hour doesn't mean
it's a Maths class

145
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,237
Only a healthy mind
will make them learn

146
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,451
Who else will I give it to?

147
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,746
We must use tricks
which fetch results

148
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,877
By the time you use yourtricks
Matthew will be dating her

149
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,532
Check with Gadha if you want

150
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,146
Tell me, dude

151
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,066
Love at first sight he says

152
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,623
I am a terror, Gadha

153
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,381
While we are sitting bored here
waiting for Unmesh master...

154
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,104
Why did you send for me?
Anything special?

155
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,285
1 hour wasted for me

156
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,556
-Who said so?
- Thalakan

157
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,037
People know Sachin and Maradona

158
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,390
See you, Mr Maths master

159
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,425
Didn't you see her
smiling at me?

160
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,179
Fatso! I'll finish you

161
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:29,837
Fighting over a girl in commerce is
very shameful for us science students

162
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:37,125
Howwill you decide?

163
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,296
"Thala... heads it is"

164
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,808
Sana is for me

165
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,841
I will start dieting from today

166
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,975
lgnore them

167
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,750
What is it, dude?

168
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,388
Go ahead
Give it

169
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,189
What sort of a name is that?

170
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,672
I bought this chocolate with my money

171
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,417
Friend, keep away from this

172
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,942
- How do you knoiAf?
-I knew long back

173
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,972
That chap overthere?

174
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,389
I meant
Don't say 'no'

175
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,231
lam a great fan of Akkuka
right from my school days

176
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,276
Hey! Here
Up here

177
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,328
We see such love-lorn faces
only in bars!

178
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,037
They may have many girls as friends
But none to fall in love

179
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,637
- Come with me
- No, dude

180
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,430
Those boys would have battered me

181
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,485
With our limited resources, spend
on treats and phone recharge

182
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:58,681
Borrow to buy them gifts, when we are
so broke to even pawn our undies

183
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,372
lf Malar goes then self help!

184
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,477
"You will knowthe value then
of genuine friendship, machan"

185
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,413
"If you have a friend loyal and true
you can face any hurdle in life, dude"

186
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,354
"You train with weights at the gym
he'll be your dumb bells to make you trim"

187
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,716
"Whenl puke my guts out
he'll be the cleaner, no doubt"

188
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,892
"Forever friend, forever friend
and I am always with you"

189
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:30,741
"Forever friend, forever friend
and I am always with you"

190
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:40,245
"I'm always with you"

191
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,550
I will call our Sneha teacher
and try my luck

192
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,200
- Hello
- Miss...?

193
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,715
Just like that
Hope all are doing well at home

194
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:18,863
What is centromeric... chromatis...?

195
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,125
Meet me in the staff room
before class tomorrow, okay?

196
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:29,493
Miss, l was studying so hard
I didn't realize I skipped chapters

197
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,868
Nowl am in a soup
She hung up on me

198
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,412
Haven't you solved it yet?

199
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,895
Even before my teacher
wrote it on the board...

200
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,980
lwould have solved it

201
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,683
Traitor!

202
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:33,024
- Haven't you done your home work?
- My stomach is aching badly

203
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:02,950
I finished early
Don't you have class?

204
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,803
We can cut class
and get out anytime

205
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,764
I know all about it, my dear girl

206
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,664
Go ahead, I'll tell the Principal
how you stalked me and kissed me

207
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,892
I can say so
only if! like you, right?

208
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,236
I don't like you

209
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,931
It means you like me

210
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,940
If you don't like me
then you must return it

211
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,089
In class?

212
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,187
This is the invitation for
ourAnnual day celebrations

213
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:17,504
0n the 30th of this month
we have scheduled ourAnnual day

214
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,934
-Yes or no?
-Yes, sir

215
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,621
'The Lament From
Gagultha Mountain'

216
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,040
Not compulsory to listen, rig ht?

217
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:54,016
We must use only a small piece
of sodium in this experiment

218
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,177
Now begins the drama

219
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,279
l have a class
only in the last hour

220
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,973
Look at it spinning
like a firework wheel

221
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,992
Run...it will burst

222
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,757
Are you teaching students
how to make bombs? ldiot!

223
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,997
They look lovely in a color dress
than in uniform, isn't it?

224
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,092
Rosha, don't simply flirt, okay?

225
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,866
0h! Afriend, eh?

226
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,466
My dear boy

227
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,727
Like your cheap Maths master
I won't complain to the principal

228
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,971
Grandmother is milder
and he's lucky!

229
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,343
Bro, we are doomed

230
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,338
Let's change our item

231
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,382
-What is that?
- Our dear Mani chettan

232
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:10,935
"Don't run a marathon
You'll get tired and tumble down"

233
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:20,396
"If you make an effort not to get tired"

234
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:30,020
"By the side ofthe tar-road you'll see"

235
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:39,706
"Soft steamed white rice as feast
with fresh fish curry as a treat"

236
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:57,868
"I went to the market in Chalakudy"

237
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,235
"I met a fishenNoman there
like sandalwood doll rare"

238
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:13,544
"She had in her basket, fresh to savor
spotted pearls, shrimp and red snapper"

239
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:43,914
"Won't l flash in your memory
at least for a moment, my dearie?"

240
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:47,933
"When you go to college, dear
And see a sea of faces unfamiliar"

241
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:58,167
"When I first met you, sweetie
you were like a new mango on the tree"

242
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,311
"When I first met you, honey
you were like a fresh mango on the tree"

243
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:13,878
"I waited foryou to ripen sweet
my sweetheart, my tasty feast"

244
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:27,744
"Grey mullets I caught today
swimming at this time yesterday"

245
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:34,574
"Grey mullets I caught today
swimming at this time yesterday"

246
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:41,644
"Breaking all barriers deftly
Smoothening ridges in the fields swiftly"

247
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:48,374
"Breaking all barriers deftly
Smoothening ridges in the fields swiftly"

248
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:54,828
"Grey mullets I caught today
swimming at this time yesterday"

249
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:24,956
"0' firefly with gossamer wing"

250
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:32,238
"Firefly with gossamer wing flitting free"

251
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:42,137
"Aren't you afraid to fly all alone?"

252
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:51,850
"Firefly with silver wings fluttering free"

253
00:56:57,013 --> 00:57:01,017
"Aren't you afraid to fly all alone?"

254
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:13,440
"0' firefly with gossamer wing"

255
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:25,853
Akash

256
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,531
Gadha...Gadha?

257
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:03,527
This is the paper of a student
who has shown outstanding performance

258
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,091
Always clearing doubts
no one else had?

259
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:41,181
Always talking and passing
comments in class

260
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:50,490
What have you got to say
about this as his parent?

261
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,402
Why?

262
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,222
I doubt how he even
passed his 10th grade

263
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,471
Both of you must come

264
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,325
How is he eligible?

265
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,003
My grandfather has never
even heard of the word 'school'

266
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,344
He's brilliant

267
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:55,517
That's what! said too

268
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,556
1st you need practical education

269
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,961
With his incomparable intellect
that's what he is fit for

270
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:35,495
They were rescued by us
brave sons ofthe ocean

271
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:43,217
I take leave, sir

272
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,631
Her anatomy fits
a biology teacher 100%

273
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:22,245
Son, if you have doubts
clear it with her, okay?

274
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,254
Asking doubts in the middle ofthe night
is the sign of a good student

275
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:40,407
Will you knock down my self respect?

276
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,415
The day was still cool and wet

277
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,210
And it looks like rain

278
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,334
But just...

279
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,100
What?

280
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,816
- Close your eyes
-Why?

281
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:31,770
I wanted to kiss both eyes

282
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,261
Stop boasting
and get lost!

283
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,670
We have lab work today
lforgot my lab record

284
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,330
- We don't have lab today, idiot
-Why?

285
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,161
A scene from Mahabharat
Disrobing of Panchali

286
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,943
Who is acting as Panchali?

287
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:40,963
'Butjustice will prevail some time soon'

288
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,132
Lowerthe curtain
Curtain please!

289
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:55,283
- My tooth fell
-I got too involved in my role

290
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,771
I thought you were
the greedy Duryodhana

291
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,746
Dude, you've lost it totally, eh?

292
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,184
My debut directorial venture
Please don't mess it up

293
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,770
According to my body
I should be Baahubali

294
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,760
lam all tense now

295
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,889
Get me the glass

296
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,479
Come

297
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,473
'...why do you keep silent?'

298
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,067
'- Bheemasena
- Draupu?'

299
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,884
'Aryaputra Yudhishtra'

300
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,363
'l was made the scapegoat'

301
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,331
'If you lay your hand on a woman
your hand should not be chopped'

302
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,959
God! What happened
to our Maths master?

303
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,350
I am thrilled
Lowerthe curtain

304
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:05,139
No need to go alone
and talk to anyone

305
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,544
Assignment?

306
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,539
- Of course you must
- Okay

307
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,404
Mom was sitting next to me

308
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,902
How many times
did you change schools?

309
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:57,221
I came just now

310
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,036
I am going

311
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,820
Don't tease him
He's a simple soul

312
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,966
2nd hour, tell them
they have a test

313
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:52,437
Poor fellow!
Look how he's suffering

314
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,331
I painted myself blue and
sat for 2 and 1/2 hours

315
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,508
Master, you must forgive me

316
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:22,500
After I turn into the character
I have no control over myself

317
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,518
Get lost!

318
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:40,917

 always got zero in Maths exams
I hate Maths teachers

319
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,479
Anything is okay?

320
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:39,029
"Her eyes chatted with me
killing me softly but slowly"

321
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:49,983
"Her eyes chatted with me
killing me ever so mercilessly"

322
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:54,482
"As butterflies in my heart dance a tattoo"

323
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:06,069
"Like the Google map I followed you duly"

324
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:27,067
"She walked ahead of me
I followed her devotedly"

325
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:32,258
"Her eyes chatted with me
killing me unexpectedly"

326
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:43,368
"Her eyes chatted with me
killing me so beautifully"

327
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,177
-Where is everybody else?
- They've gone for a wedding

328
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:58,414
Why should you come?

329
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,191
If someone sees
you are dead meat

330
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:16,478
"I stepped into your house
Waves ofjoy in me arose"

331
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:24,013
"Goose bumps you know
From my head to toe"

332
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:34,171
"If you smile, my heart feels divine
Unlimited 'Share' and 'Like' online"

333
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:45,078
"Waves of love at night
pervade my heart with delight"

334
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:50,416
"On your shoulder, overyour tresses
I want to rest my head, princess"

335
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:44,358
How many times to tell you?

336
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:51,883
He's been doing this
for quite some time

337
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,389
[overlap of angry voices]

338
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,407
Stop the bus

339
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:17,699
l'll teach you all a lesson

340
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,787
Happy birthday to you

341
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,584
Only this?
No cake for me?

342
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:39,705
"Love me, life divine"

343
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:19,789
Celebrating her birthday with boys
in the middle of the night

344
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,453
If it had been my parents
you would've been kicked out

345
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,131
All Christians are like that

346
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,759
Since your dad is loaded
why will he borrow shamelessly?

347
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,999
Come to the church carnival tomorrow
We'll have a blast there

348
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,180
- I'll come for sure
- Then we'll enjoy

349
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,012
You are not going alone
to the carnival to have a blast, okay?

350
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,486
"Eyes dusky and sloe
Lined with charcoal khol"

351
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:58,501
"One festive day dawned
brightness and bliss adorned"

352
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:03,862
"Like a sparkler shining and shimmering
Flash of a smile in her eyes simmering"

353
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:11,609
"Spare me a glance only once
Aword from you in accordance"

354
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:19,437
"Dear miss, mademoiselle
My darling damsel"

355
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:28,670
"One festive day dawned
brightness and bliss adorned"

356
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:52,600
"Like a love song sublime
my heart hums the notes divine"

357
01:19:54,523 --> 01:20:00,701
"Will my Susanna darling
hearthose notes endearing?"

358
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:16,412
"Arteries and veins illumined by a light
Words smothered in honeyed delight"

359
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:20,573
"Roosting on dreams to savor
Festival spirit favors the flavor"

360
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,044
"A band of drummers beat
a tattoo within the heart sweet"

361
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:31,822
"Spare me a glance only once
Aword from you in accordance"

362
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:35,955
"Step along with me for this song
Dance, my lovely lass, come along"

363
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:50,192
"One festive day dawned
brightness and bliss adorned"

364
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:10,622
"Dear miss, mademoiselle
My darling damsel"

365
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:18,633
There's a way to booze, dude

366
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,747
Bro, give it to me

367
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:37,847
Be quiet

368
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,609
Who the hell is sending
so many messages?

369
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,297
Piece?
Where?

370
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:57,114
Not 'piece' as in chic
Porn videos in our school group

371
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,243
The teachers are also here

372
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,890
I'll set it right now, wait

373
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,731
You must press
'Delete for everyone'

374
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,961
The lady at the office knows
You are finished

375
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:49,432
Bro, if we attend a wedding uninvited
people will stare, that's all

376
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:57,499
Which site did you pick?

377
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,350
The reaction depends on the size
of the piece you drop in water

378
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:33,810
Silence!

379
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:44,292
'Potaasium metal reacts
very rapidly with water'

380
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,829
'Okay?'

381
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,089
- Come on
- Me?

382
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:28,078
Okay

383
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:39,729
If you drop a piece unknowingly
the reaction is really huge

384
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:46,577
The matter has reached Princi's ears

385
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,829
If I were in your shoes
l'll ignore him totally

386
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:05,569
Shameless fellow!

387
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,465
This is not a blunder
Most vulgar!

388
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:24,330
My dad isn't in India

389
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:33,931
All children brought up
by single mothers are like this

390
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:43,190
You should have thought of it
before doing this

391
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:52,973
Sorry, sir
It won't happen again

392
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:03,364
Suspension letter
Come back after1 week

393
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:20,480
Don't condemn me
without knowing the truth

394
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:29,461
When you shared that dirty video
you know it will affect me too

395
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:40,267
I don't want to continue
our relationship

396
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:16,341
Get lost, you chit of a girl!

397
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:44,011
Hey dude, with your suspension
you can go home and have a ball!

398
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:50,986
Then what, bro?
Want to commit suicide?

399
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:10,590
Then go tell our principal
you uploaded that video

400
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:18,518
My parents will commit suicide

401
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:27,414
You are the main cause
So you must rescue him

402
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:36,480
He will somehow solve it
withoutyourmom knowing

403
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:45,850
Kurla Express leaves at 6:30p.m

404
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:14,263
In spite ofthat
you behaved like a jerk

405
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,354
'We are done for'

406
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,222
My wife has taken a vow now
It's her sacred ritual

407
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:41,477
Call the next one

408
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,757
'Kuthu' team
Come here

409
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,321
You called us

410
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:02,136
Aren't you the boys Gadha sent?

411
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,386
I'll give you what you deserve, wait

412
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:18,600
Why don't you sit?

413
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,985
Don't troll policemen, my son

414
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:38,664
Don't worry
You can be frank with him

415
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:46,986
Notme...he did

416
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:56,480
Don't you know it's a crime
to watch such videos?

417
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:05,647
If you are charged with both these cases
3 of you will be behind bars for 5 years

418
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:15,249
'Aiyo! I'll never again watch, sir'

419
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:33,898
Let him come
I'll show him

420
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:52,518
Good evening, sir

421
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,653
lam the Principal
of Don Bosco school

422
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:11,752
Did these boys cause any trouble?

423
01:32:19,734 --> 01:32:20,780
Railway track, huh?

424
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:29,895
Here

425
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,608
Just read what's written there

426
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:48,025
To my dear mother

427
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:58,479
Your son is leaving this nasty world

428
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:07,144
You must tell dad
I love him a lot, ma

429
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:17,852
Who is Appu?

430
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:29,371
The cause for my suicide
is only one person

431
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:46,162
He harassed me
mentally and physically

432
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:56,538
With love

433
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,775
'He must be locked up right away'

434
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:13,860
Did all that actually happen?

435
01:34:19,086 --> 01:34:22,237
Oh gawd! Sir, I haven't
harassed him at all

436
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:26,256
Just a few words of caution
telling him right from wrong

437
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:34,656
They are young boys
Can't I advise them?

438
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:43,286
If a person commits suicide and whoever
abets the commission of such suicide

439
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,774
There's another case
pertaining to juvenile justice act

440
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:01,921
What if he had died?
You would've been trapped

441
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:09,097
Everybody is happy?

442
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:20,144
Tomorrow all of you must go
to your class happily, okay?

443
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:32,235
Sir, a teacher must have a broad mind
to understand theirtender thoughts

444
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:39,731
Yes, sir

445
01:35:55,816 --> 01:35:57,886
Don't forget sections #67 and #293

446
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:09,641
What can! say, bro?
I almost died of tension

447
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:17,241
Fatso! l'll kick you out
Sit quietly there

448
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:43,428
Thank you

449
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:53,718
-What is this?
- Love letter

450
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,088
He gave it to Gayathri of 6th grade

451
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:11,084
Is this such a big crime, sir?

452
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:22,342
- Haven't you?
- Plenty

453
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:31,185
- Come here
-Yes, sir

454
01:37:31,445 --> 01:37:35,040
Understanding all these
tenderfeelings of young minds

455
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:43,311
That's the perfect teacher
with a broad mind, right?

456
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:59,498
Sir, teach him to behave gently
and calmly with students

457
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:09,857
Hereafter if you come here
with silly complaints

458
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,238
- Give it here
- Eat it

459
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:27,607
So with all yourtension gone
you are happy now, right?

460
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:36,187
Priya and him

461
01:38:54,662 --> 01:38:57,756
She will come behind you
like this, wagging her tail

462
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,763
She will be upset
when you love someone else

463
01:39:04,138 --> 01:39:05,389
Then she'll come back automatically

464
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:22,316
Will this work out?

465
01:39:30,197 --> 01:39:32,062
- Have you seen his dad?
- No

466
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,895
Okay, now look at each other

467
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:49,762
What is wrong with my face?

468
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:00,454
-Will it be okay?
-Yes, sure

469
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:10,753

470

Sorry

491
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:48,267
In case you feel like watching-

01:45:48,642 --> 01:45:49,483
”I do?

493
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:15,732
What else?

494
01:46:22,909 --> 01:46:25,480
She was with you all the time
How will you miss me then?

495
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:34,881
That's what I told you

502
01:47:57,571 --> 01:47:58,731
Why are you so aloof?

503
01:47:59,005 --> 01:47:59,994
Any problem?

504
01:48:07,948 --> 01:48:08,937
Then okay

505
01:48:18,191 --> 01:48:19,931
Are you scared?

506
01:48:24,898 --> 01:48:29,437

That's what! asked
What's up with you?

509
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:13,456
All of you made Gadha and me
act as if we are in love

510
01:49:22,355 --> 01:49:23,083
Love!?

511
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:30,533
If you had confessed
your love to Gadha

512
01:49:30,830 --> 01:49:32,058
...she would've slapped you

513
01:49:36,336 --> 01:49:39,578
She will never fall in love
Especially with you

514
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:49,976
You think l have
no betterjob

515
01:49:55,355 --> 01:49:58,313

01:50:44,204 --> 01:50:46,445
Sir, that may be
because I was bored

520
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:54,374
Get up

521
01:51:02,355 --> 01:51:04,084
'Manavala, look here'

522
01:51:12,065 --> 01:51:13,111
Kakothree?

523
01:51:21,441 --> 01:51:22,169
'I don't think so'

524
01:51:48,134 --> 01:51:50,022
Roshan's record book, eh?

525
01:52:06,486 --> 01:52:07,646
Srees hanth

526
01:52:16,496 --> 01:52:18,475
For naming you Sreeshanth

527
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:25,810
ln big league games

528
01:52:35,215 --> 01:52:38,343
When you do that
it nauseates the batsman

529
01:52:43,456 --> 01:52:44,935
Okay, thank you, sir

530
01:53:03,343 --> 01:53:04,981
You can learn it yourselves

531
01:53:11,317 --> 01:53:12,955
'All our hopes dashed to the ground!'

532
01:53:21,027 --> 01:53:23,211
You would have seen
this picture, right?

533
01:53:29,235 --> 01:53:31,123
This doubt has been
nagging me for ages

534
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:32,665
'There he goes again!'

535
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:41,645
Silence

536
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:50,581
Tomorrowyou must lead
the NSS camp, sit down

537
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:01,232
Get going, dude

538
01:54:08,141 --> 01:54:11,599
Won't those mountains have
plenty of stories to tell, bro?

539
01:54:16,649 --> 01:54:17,957
Do you see a hole?

540
01:54:18,218 --> 01:54:19,321
Yes

541
01:54:25,124 --> 01:54:28,628
Matthew, ourjuniors
appear to be smart, eh?

542
01:54:35,268 --> 01:54:37,008
To show Sneha miss

543
01:54:53,019 --> 01:54:54,384
-Hi
-Hi

544
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:12,879
This is a simplejob for me

545
01:55:20,947 --> 01:55:21,788
'His idea'

546
01:55:29,722 --> 01:55:31,940
No need, dig the pit
forthe saplings

547
01:55:37,063 --> 01:55:39,202
You are crossing
your limit these days

548
01:55:47,473 --> 01:55:50,624
Standing here alone
and avoiding work, eh?

549
01:55:55,615 --> 01:55:57,799
Honestly, I don't feel
like going back

550
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:07,297
Think they are Jack and Rose in Titanic

551
01:56:16,035 --> 01:56:17,434
You are right!
It's a great view

552
01:56:25,645 --> 01:56:27,749
Forget the thanks
Give me my treat

553
01:56:43,429 --> 01:56:44,885
Why make her dram

554
01:56:52,538 --> 01:56:54,312
You had better draw
your own diagrams

555
01:57:09,455 --> 01:57:10,615
She's mad

556
01:57:18,164 --> 01:57:19,472
Go and apologize

557
01:57:26,606 --> 01:57:28,494
Destroying one's peace of mind

558
01:58:03,209 --> 01:58:05,484
Oh! So you do

559
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:14,280
She will like you

560
01:58:29,535 --> 01:58:33,096
l'm possessive
I fight with you all the time

561
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:43,060
But I think it is more
of a disturbance to you

562
01:59:46,612 --> 01:59:48,307
Why are you preoccupied then?

563
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:55,922
Best

564
01:59:55,922 --> 02:00:00,803
My dear, school tour is an event
only a lucky few get to enjoy in life

565
02:00:01,894 --> 02:00:05,398
Why think of exams
and spoil your mood?

566
02:00:29,355 --> 02:00:36,272
"le bliss, my happiness
My sheer blessedness"

567
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:43,838
"le heaven, my paradise
My euphoria, my blue skies"

568
02:00:44,837 --> 02:00:51,777
"le cloud 9
My Xanadu divine"

569
02:00:52,845 --> 02:00:59,637
"le 7th heaven
My garden of Eden"

570
02:01:15,635 --> 02:01:22,552
"O' my life, my soul beside me
Like a golden flame burning brightly"

571
02:01:23,576 --> 02:01:30,368
"My heartbeat, my life's meaning
You are my breath, my everything"

572
02:01:31,384 --> 02:01:38,062
"O' my life, my love beside me
Like a steady flame shining brightly"

573
02:01:39,091 --> 02:01:46,054
"le true love, my alter ego
You are my breath, my halo"

574
02:01:47,433 --> 02:01:54,373
"le bliss, my happiness
My sheer blessedness"

575
02:01:55,408 --> 02:02:01,927
"le heaven, my paradise
My euphoria, my blue skies"

576
02:02:02,948 --> 02:02:09,865
"le cloud 9
My Xanadu divine"

577
02:02:10,923 --> 02:02:17,624
"le 7th heaven
My garden of Eden"

578
02:02:43,923 --> 02:02:50,601
"Buds of desiresilently started to sprout"

579
02:02:51,697 --> 02:02:58,580
"You touched the depths of my soul
Tremors of pain only I could console"

580
02:02:59,605 --> 02:03:05,669
"ln waves of dizzy solitude
I sing this happy tune"

581
02:03:10,883 --> 02:03:14,125
"You blossom like a flowerwithin me"

582
02:03:18,624 --> 02:03:22,048
"Clouds of love swirled, my dear"

583
02:03:30,202 --> 02:03:37,119
"My heartbeat, my life's meaning
You are my breath, my everything"

584
02:03:38,177 --> 02:03:44,969
"O' my life, my love beside me
Like a steady flame shining brightly"

585
02:03:45,985 --> 02:03:52,925
"le true love, my alter ego
You are my breath, my halo"

586
02:03:54,427 --> 02:03:56,929
I'll be happiest
after tomorrow's exam

587
02:03:56,929 --> 02:03:58,499
No need to come this way at all

588
02:04:05,004 --> 02:04:06,892
We will be forever friends
even after school life

589
02:04:15,047 --> 02:04:18,005
- Tomorrow's exam tension?
- Not at all

590
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:25,545
Priya?

591
02:04:32,898 --> 02:04:35,640
After that he started
falling for Gadha

592
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:46,452
Then why didn't you tell her?

593
02:04:52,785 --> 02:04:54,798
Nothing like that
She loves him too

594
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:03,287
But I thought it was cheap
on my part to think that way

595
02:05:12,505 --> 02:05:14,780
Bro, what is her favorite place?

596
02:05:21,514 --> 02:05:23,675
Chapara
She loves that place

597
02:05:30,222 --> 02:05:32,031
We'll set up the rendezvous for you, okay?

598
02:05:37,796 --> 02:05:40,310
Now all you have to do
is propose to her

599
02:05:43,569 --> 02:05:49,485
"O' my life, my soul beside me
Like a golden flame burning brightly"

600
02:05:58,117 --> 02:06:04,966
"O' my life, my love beside me
Like a steady flame shining brightly"

601
02:06:05,991 --> 02:06:12,601
"le true love, my alter ego
You are my breath, my halo"

602
02:06:14,266 --> 02:06:21,092
"le bliss, my happiness
My sheer blessedness"

603
02:06:22,207 --> 02:06:28,726
"le heaven, my paradise
My euphoria, my blue skies"

604
02:06:29,715 --> 02:06:36,416
"le cloud 9
My Xanadu divine"

605
02:06:53,272 --> 02:06:58,915
"Love sparkle in delight
from eyes like moonlight"

606
02:07:01,647 --> 02:07:03,922
2 years of high school
Went by so fast

607
02:07:11,156 --> 02:07:14,455
So dad's money will be useful
to go abroad and study medicine

608
02:07:30,009 --> 02:07:31,488
Really!

609
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:41,378
We first met... mmm

610
02:07:50,029 --> 02:07:51,485
Then what else do you expect?

611
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:00,312
That is-

612
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:23,959
We werejust leaving, brother

613
02:09:48,781 --> 02:09:50,760
But talking never happens

614
02:10:33,358 --> 02:10:35,906
Ros ha!

615
02:10:47,873 --> 02:10:56,110
"Athousand lamps of pure delight
you lit in my life so bright"

616
02:10:57,416 --> 02:11:05,790
"My dreams that flamed at night
Only you brought them into the limelight"

617
02:11:07,059 --> 02:11:14,932
"On every drop of blood that fell here

 sawthe reflection of your face so dear"

618
02:11:16,568 --> 02:11:24,441
"Fading away slowly into the horizon
Amemory sinking into oblivion"

619
02:11:25,978 --> 02:11:31,803
"Blissful unconsciousness"

620
02:11:35,387 --> 02:11:41,451
"Blissful unconsciousness"

621
02:11:44,296 --> 02:11:51,179
"Disappeared into depths of darkness"

622
02:11:53,705 --> 02:12:00,213
"Disappeared into depths of darkness"

623
02:12:47,759 --> 02:12:51,536
"Scattered and blown away shattering"

624
02:12:52,564 --> 02:12:59,948
"Upon a boulder of death
Petals of love shower as a wreath"

625
02:13:01,073 --> 02:13:08,946
"Across skies unknown
Among cloudsstrewn"

626
02:13:15,387 --> 02:13:19,221
"Won't we unite together?
Won't we live forever?"

627
02:13:20,258 --> 02:13:27,642
"My life, my love complete
My breath, my heartbeat"

628
02:13:29,668 --> 02:13:37,188
"My life, my love complete
My breath, my heartbeat"

629
02:13:40,278 --> 02:13:46,695
"Blissful unconsciousness"

630
02:13:49,755 --> 02:13:56,547
"Blissful unconsciousness"

631
02:13:58,597 --> 02:14:05,799
"Disappeared into depths of darkness"

632
02:14:08,206 --> 02:14:15,556
"Disappeared into depths of darkness"
