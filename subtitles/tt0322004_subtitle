"Badi Ma, DWijdas, Kumud, Padma,
Dharamdas, Where's everybody?"

3
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:45,267
"Look, here's Devdas' letter.
Devdas is returning from London"

4
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,105
Really? Happy tidings!

5
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:53,071
DWijdas! You hear? Devdas is coming!
- I don't think so. Ma is lying

6
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:56,314
"You're lying, Ma.
- Here's the letter"

7
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,948
ShoW me the letter

00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,986
Give your brother the good neWs

Badi Ma... Badi Ma...

Thank God

00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:20,001
"Compliments, lady!
- Not in tears Dharamdas"

13
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:23,342
I Want a promise. I am going...
to receive Devdas. I alone.

14
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:30,480
"Yes, but Wind the clocks once again
After so many years! My son is back"

15
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:36,255
"Winding clocks Won't make time move,
nor any faster brings the son home"

16
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,490
I knoW Kumud! But look
hoW my heart throbs

17
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,694
Oh When Will the day give Way
to the night?

18
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:48,492
Drum up the cheer!
Let the music play

19
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:56,301
What joyous tempest stirs my
heartstrings! Drum up the cheer

20
00:04:56,643 --> 00:05:01,637
Let the music play!
- Welcome the onset of Tempest

21
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:14,321
"All day I'm hollering at everyone
to get ready, and no one listens?"

22
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:18,654
The house has been spruced up.
- Devdas' room is ready

23
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:26,666
Dharamdas has tethered the horses.
- Badi Ma decided Who Wears What

24
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:28,465
Happy?

25
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:33,674
"Once you get your baby, you'll knoW
What joy is in seeing him come home"

26
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:37,350
Kaushalya Didi (Didi: Sister)
- Goodness! Here comes the actress

27
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:40,676
"In she traipses and,

00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:59,138
"AIWays opportune.
And your "Shondesh" is famous!"

32
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,441
Hear that Didi?
- Let her talk. Guess Who's coming?

33
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:05,404
I knoW! Mr Chattopadhyay?

34
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:12,646
"Silly! You Won't believe this!
My Tempest, my Devdas is coming!"

35
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:15,181
"Really Didi?
- Yes, yes, really!"

36
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:17,114
Thank Goddess Durga

37
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:22,724
"My compliments, Didi!
- I'm seeing my son after 10 years"

38
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,263
What might he look like? What might
he sound like? What Will he tell me?

39
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:32,036
"HoW am I going to survive
tonight, Sumitra?"

40
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:39,110
HoW I Wish I Wouldn't blink!
What if he Walks in right then?

41
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:45,314
"I only remember Devdas, the boy
Who'd Walk up to my house..."

42
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:50,746
"peep around the door to ask me...
- Kaki-Ma, is Paro in?"

43
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,153
"There she goes, into the act"

44
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:00,495
"And When Dev stormed out,
I'd send Paro to find him"

45
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:04,361
Found him alWays in guava orchards.
- And Dharamdas Would haul him in...

46
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:10,370
by his ear! Some friendship!
- And When Devdas Was leaving...

47
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,046
"going abroad for his studies,
hoW my Paro ran after his buggy..."

48
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:18,850
as if possessed. Arre O'Deva

49
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:21,187
Arre O'Deva

50
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:25,389
"In that scorching sun, her feet
blistering on the gravelly soil..."

51
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:32,028
"yet she ran on, screaming,
I'm going With Dev"

52
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:37,431
I'm going abroad too!
- Are you out of your mind?

53
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:44,542
Send her abroad? My silly girl

54
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:50,439
She oWed Dev three Rupees

55
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,687
Let me go. I got to give him
his 3 Rupees

56
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:02,121
A lamp lit for a loved one
draWs the Wayfarer home

57
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:06,057
"For 10 years, in that belief
she kept that lamp alight for Dev"

58
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,861
"Not once she let the lamp go out!
I must tell her, she'll be glad"

59
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:18,033
"She Will be overjoyed.
- Yes Sumitra, go"

60
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:25,377
It's your son Who's coming home
and she is the happier for it

61
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:29,051
Why not? She's our neighbour.
Paro and Devdas...

62
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,381
Were childhood friends.
- What's left of that childhood?

63
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:36,718
"Both are groWn ups noW...
Kaki-Ma's "Shondesh"?"

64
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,480
"What's up Kaki-Ma?
- Manorama, Where is Paro?"

65
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:01,343
"Where else? Must be in her room,
talking to her lamp"

66
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:04,282
Not lamp!
- Devdas

67
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,387
Oh God.
- What's the matter?

68
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:12,025
The neWs I have for her
Will drive her mad With joy

69
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,389
What neWs?

70
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,362
"Paro, Devdas is coming"

71
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:21,365
"Really?
- Yes, Devdas is coming"

72
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:26,372
They're preparing for a Welcome!
Kaushalya-Didi is nearly going mad

73
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:29,204
The Whole house is
in raptures...

74
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,507
"Silly, are you crying?"

75
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:36,050
Let not tears of joy
douse the lamp before Dev arrives

76
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:40,849
No poWer on Earth can put out
this lamp

77
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:45,930
Shall We put the mighty lamp
to test?

78
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:21,197
At season's change...

79
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:24,397
comes...

80
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:28,104
cloudWaves

81
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:32,373
A Waft...

82
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:35,374
Will come...

83
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,115
to bloW out this lamp

84
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:48,722
This longing I didn't let die

85
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:05,668
This longing I never let die

86
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:10,676
"This lamp, my love..."

87
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:19,215
"Will never be extinguished,
this flame of my love"

88
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:24,694
"My love, come to me my love"

89
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:31,696
NoW come to me

90
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:37,375
As this lamp burns...

91
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,010
"I'm burning in my every pore
and my heart"

92
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:45,712
NoW come to me

93
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,722
"Come to me, my love"

94
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,500
Distance parted us...

95
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,769
there Was the pain of parting

96
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:50,276
My eyes yearned...

97
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:55,176
but there you Were...

98
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:59,056
"glittering, gloWing..."

99
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:01,257
aWash in joys...

100
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:05,395
While here...

101
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,666
"'I burned..."

102
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:14,338
"While here, I burned"

103
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:21,137
"Once again, clouds thunder..."

104
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:24,678
raining in thunderous rhapsody

105
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,485
Tempest strikes again...

106
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:31,688
but my lamp is never doused...

107
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:34,352
"my love, my flame..."

108
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:40,599
"no matter hoW much the rains,
tempest and thunder torment you"

109
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:48,467
"Come noW, come to me, my love"

110
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:54,337
"Come, my love"

111
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:04,150
She's crazy

112
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:07,649
She's naive

113
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:14,196
"Oh yes, With a gust of Wind
Will come the one you seek"

114
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:15,998
My love...

115
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:19,667
come to me my love

116
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:27,938
"The passion,
she Will never let die"

117
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:33,683
"My love, this lamp is you"

118
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:09,318
"Hurry! The buggy is here!
Kaushalya, quick"

119
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:12,988
Devdas is here!
- Coming

120
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:17,160
I Was lighting the Welcome-lamp.
Tell Badi-Ma

121
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,231
"If you take so much time,
Devdas Will give himself a Welcome"

122
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:24,468
"Give himself a Welcome?
Today, I'm Welcoming him"

123
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:30,936
Wait a minute! I get to see Devdas
first. Everyone shut your eyes

124
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:34,677
For my sake.
- All right?

125
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:40,341
Lady! I don't believe! Could the
World change so much in ten years?

126
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:46,352
"Deva is as tall as my shoulders,
my very shoulders he sat upon"

127
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:51,061
See him and you'll forget to blink!
- Don't torment me! Where's my Dev?

128
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:54,696
"Got off on the Way. Said, he Will
be back after seeing "My Paro"

129
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:59,938
Should be here any moment

130
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:03,865
"Chhoto-Ma, you Wanted to be the first
to set your eyes on Devdas?"

131
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,835
Will it be Paro's eyes noW?

132
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,641
"Chhoto-Ma, What to do With this?"

133
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:27,727
Paro

134
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,402
I think it's Devdas

135
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,142
Devdas...

136
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:46,741
"hoW have you been? Fine?
Come in son, Welcome"

137
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:49,550
"Bless you, son"

138
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:55,054
You look just like an Englishman!
We've been so eager to see you

139
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,795
Kaushalya-Didi is dying to see you.
- Where is Paro?

140
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:02,400
She Was here a moment ago

141
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:06,166
"She said, let Devdas come
and I'll do this and I'll do that"

142
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:11,306
I'll fight With him and scratch him.
NoW you're here and she's hiding

143
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:12,372
Ei Paro

144
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:16,079
"Can I go upstairs?
- Yes son, go on"

145
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,886
HoW have you been Paro?

146
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:46,266
Won't you turn to see my face?
We're meeting after so many days

147
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:50,234
"Days? For you, maybe.
For me..."

148
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:54,479
"10 years, 6 months,
4 days and 6 hours"

149
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:58,477
You never missed me?
- I did

150
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:03,686
Lies! Only 5 letters in 10 years?
There are four seasons in a year

151
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:11,254
Couldn't you Write once a season?
- Makes sense. You're a big girl

152
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:13,695
Takes time?

153
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,365
The desire to meet the sea
turns the stream into a river

154
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:19,227
Then Why take time
to shoW your face?

155
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:24,703
"Like sighting the Moon after ages,
I fear I'll leave you breathless"

156
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:32,717
Not even the Moon is as vain.
- But the Moon is scarred

157
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:39,190
"Till moonrise spare the Moon,
to see Which leaves me breathless..."

158
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,719
the Moon's radiance?
Or your vanity?

159
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:53,171
"Paro, I hate the thought
of someone else touching you"

160
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:06,344
"Look, Devdas is here!
- Let him come"

161
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,676
Don't be cross.
- I don't Want to talk to him

162
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,148
Tell him to go aWay.
- But Ma...

163
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,481
"I said, I don't Want to...
- Ma"

164
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:22,030
"Go, I don't Want to see your face"

165
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:25,693
"Why, What's so ugly
about my face..."

166
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,374
that neither Paro
nor you Want to see?

167
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,371
"After 10 years of Waiting,
the neighbour gets to Welcome you?"

168
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,703
Go back to your Paro

169
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:41,277
Won't you open your eyes?
- I Won't

170
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:46,387
Won't see me either?

171
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:54,358
"Very Well, I'm going aWay.
- Where?"

172
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,758
"Where are you going, Dev?
- Dev, stop"

173
00:20:57,836 --> 00:21:00,669
Why did you let him leave?
I Was just joking

174
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,471
I Was joking too

175
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:21,993
My prodigal son returns a laWyer.
But no let up on the mischief?

176
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:28,365
Babu-ji? (Babu-ji: Father)
- He left for his chambers early...

177
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:31,192
"something urgent.
- I knoW, I knoW"

178
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,097
Complaints every day!

179
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:40,435
Dev and Paro never Went to school.
Dev caught smoking

180
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:43,882
All day tramping around the village
With that Paro

181
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:47,708
Not another moment
for you in this house

182
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:53,658
"The day I left,
he Wasn't at home"

183
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:58,053
"This day I return,
he still isn't here"

184
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:02,459
"You knoW, the British government
is knighting him"

185
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:06,228
I see!
- And he'll be so glad to see you

186
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:10,008
"Really?
- Glad he is, at Work"

187
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:15,336
"In my home, fathers Welcome sons
returning home after years..."

188
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:19,014
"With arms outstretched.
- Same here, child"

189
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:24,679
"Come to me, my darling"

190
00:22:30,095 --> 00:22:34,031
I told you to get me
a nice foreign Watch

191
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,095
Have you brought it?

192
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:40,702
"No, but I bring fortuitous times"

193
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:44,701
Look...

194
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:49,709
over here... but I can't even
make out clearly

195
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:55,649
"They use only paper?
- And sometimes, not even that"

196
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:57,785
I never shook hands

197
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,389
What are you upto?

198
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:09,190
Give my box back to me

199
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:11,795
Give it to me

200
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,663
What's happening?
- Nothing

201
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,835
Watching Devdas?
HoW do you find him?

202
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,342
I'm not telling.
- Tell me...

203
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:25,210
hoW do you find him?
- Like a fool

204
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:29,354
What did he say When he met you?
- I didn't shoW him my face

205
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,485
SWear that by your mother?
- I sWear

206
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,989
"Poor thing, must've been pining.
- Let him pine"

207
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:37,359
Don't make him suffer so

208
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:40,062
"Else, he'll come peeping
around the door..."

209
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,891
"and ask me,
Kaki-Ma, is Paro in?"

210
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:53,303
Only in the moonlight
he gets to see my face

211
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:42,411
Card three and I Win.
- Damn

212
00:26:43,749 --> 00:26:46,411
Lost by a Whisker.
- You alWays lose by a Whisker

213
00:26:46,752 --> 00:26:52,019
"Kumud, so What if he Wins once?
- Wrong, today's Shubhankar's day"

214
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:56,691
"No one else Wins, here comes Paro
but she can't Win either"

215
00:26:57,262 --> 00:27:01,699
You bet?
- BeWare! She'll loot you

216
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:09,369
"Well Paro, What have you brought?
- "Shondesh" for Devdas. Ma sent it"

217
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:16,714
Where's Devdas?
- The London-returned gentleman?

218
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:21,713
"Where else but in his room,
training his binoculars on London?"

219
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:38,398
"SaW? Earlier, she'd greet you first.
Up she climbs, our beauty..."

220
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:44,733
straight for Devdas.
- One too many a sWeet message

221
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:54,275
What brings the Moon doWn to Earth?
- To take your breath aWay

222
00:27:57,255 --> 00:27:59,815
What are you doing?
- Seeing hoW good my guess Was

223
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:03,489
Accurate?
- Could never be Wrong

224
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:06,488
HoW come?
- KnoWn you for ages

225
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:12,636
What's this?
- Platter

226
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:16,705
I knoW. But What's on it?
- My excuse

227
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,705
Shondesh for me?
- See for yourself

228
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,716
"Empty?
- That's the excuse, silly"

229
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,511
Goodness!
What a temper!

230
00:28:30,822 --> 00:28:33,120
You make a fine example
of hoW to lose temper

231
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,187
You're the same

232
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,722
"You too, are just
like you Were"

233
00:28:42,434 --> 00:28:45,028
Like What?
- Unsophisticated

234
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:50,731
"Naturally, after all,
you're London-returned"

235
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:56,808
"London's a big city, isn't it Dev?
- London's entirely different"

236
00:28:57,382 --> 00:29:01,011
"Great personalities, great debates.
Huge thoroughfares, huge edifices"

237
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:05,449
"London's Trafalgar Square,
pigeons, doves..."

238
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,114
The Queen's Palace

239
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:10,384
"And milling croWds,
everywhere"

240
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:14,688
Londoners live in a World
of their oWn

241
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,189
You too?

242
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:29,240
"Say, you never missed the village?
- Never, never, except..."

243
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:35,709
"When I Was fed up of the food at
the hostel, I missed Ma's dishes"

244
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,725
"And back in London,
When someone screamed at me..."

245
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:46,185
I Was reminded of my father.
No one else

246
00:29:47,732 --> 00:29:51,725
"On evening Walks, I contemplated
Dharamdas and his buggy"

247
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:56,070
"On sleepless nights,
grandmother's gentle pat"

248
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,336
Nothing else

249
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:07,676
Dev... and...

250
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:12,815
And?
- I?

251
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:15,490
Never. Or Was it once?

252
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:22,124
"No, you never came to mind, Paro.
- I never came to mind?"

253
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:25,493
Matters that come to mind
are matters that matter. But...

254
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:32,371
"you don't matter, Paro.
- True Dev, only you matter"

255
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:40,709
"5 letters, 5 times a day. HoW many
times did I read them each year?"

256
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:44,785
And hoW many times in ten years?
- Multiplied by?

257
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:51,323
"18,250 times.
That's hoW much you matter..."

258
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:57,396
"and ten years to the day, I have
kept alive the flame I lit for you"

259
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:03,069
HoW many hours has it been burning?
- If I Were to count...

260
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:10,678
"87,600 hours. So much you matter,
every second I remembered you"

261
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:16,677
"HoW many seconds to a day?
- I knoW, I'll tell you..."

262
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:21,357
You're bad at arithmetic

263
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:30,032
There Were times When I missed you.
- When?

264
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,700
Whenever I breathed

265
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:42,510
"For them, reminiscences,
those Who can be forgotten. Silly"

266
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:46,714
So effortlessly you counted off
those seconds?

267
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,713
Without as much as a thought
to every passing second...

268
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,046
that carried me aWay?

269
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:57,656
"In the flame of the lamp that
you lit, it Was I Who burned"

270
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:15,373
87600

271
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:20,673
Pity

272
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,690
Shall I tell you What's
on my mind for sometime?

273
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,921
TWo names on your mind.
Paro and Devdas

274
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:36,267
Mr Landlord! HoW did you make out?

275
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:40,701
"Kumud Was saying, Dev and Paro
are upto neW antics"

276
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,497
For hours they stare at each other
through binoculars

277
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:48,771
Shondesh is her excuse for
coming over. I don't like it

278
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:53,745
And Sumitra is daydreaming
of Paro's Wedding to Devdas

279
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:58,979
Daydreams never come true.
Neelkanth married an actress

280
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:03,192
Disgraced himself. In an alliance
With a disgraced family...

281
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:06,689
am I to bring
my family to ridicule?

282
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:11,992
"Right, but you knoW Sumitra.
She shoots off her mouth"

283
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:15,670
What if she storms in someday
proposing an alliance?

284
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:20,944
"The ansWer Will be"no
"- Why Will the ansWer be no?"

285
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:26,180
A knight and a landlord. And the
roof over our heads is leaking

286
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:27,674
Leaking?

287
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:33,691
Even my postal address has changed.
- Really?

288
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:39,027
"Neelkanth Chakraborty,
Old Mansion"

289
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:46,801
"What's lacking in our Paro?
She's pretty, she's literate"

290
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:49,368
I only got to spread the Word.
Tens of boys Will be ready...

291
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:52,871
to pay a bride-price for Paro.
- Really?

292
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:56,772
Yes. You are Worrying overmuch

293
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:00,880
Someday We Will get a proposal...
from them. You'll see

294
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:05,049
"Till then, I leave you to
your musings. I'm off for my nap"

295
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:16,896
Mr Landlord! Have a care!
Your old mansion is crumbling

296
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,301
Broke my back

297
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:35,013
All this jeWellery! All for me?
- You Will give me a grandson

298
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:37,253
Won't I give you something?

299
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:40,356
Badi-Ma has opened up her
treasure trove. Loot her

300
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:42,685
I must!

301
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:46,925
Badi-Ma! HoW exquisite!
I must Wear this

302
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:51,702
"No, that one isn't for you.
- Then, for Whom?"

303
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:55,733
For my Devdas' bride.
- Let's see

304
00:34:56,641 --> 00:35:00,475
Give it all aWay to Devdas' bride!
I Want none of this

305
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,437
Here's your elder daughter-in-laW

306
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:05,980
And everyone's all agog about
someone Who's yet to come

307
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:10,150
"Nice bracelet, isn't it?
It'll look great on your arm"

308
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:13,351
In my father's house
maids Wear bracelets like these

309
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,921
"Then consider yourself a maid,
right Badi-Ma?"

310
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:22,059
Yes! I'm maidservant in this house.
My brother-in-laW! AIWays after me

311
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:28,362
You're making a mountain out
of a molehill. I Was joking

312
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,369
"If you disapprove, I Won't even marry.
- I hate being ridiculed"

313
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:37,341
Why rib her all the time?
Badi-Ma you could've said yes...

314
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:41,345
if only to please her. You knoW
her nature. And she's pregnant

315
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:44,678
And you've brought her to tears.
NoW I got to placate her. Woe betide

316
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:54,491
"No matter hoW much honey you add,
neem is alWays bitter"

317
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,699
HoW do you like this bracelet?

318
00:36:01,372 --> 00:36:05,103
Just like you. Exotic.
- Whom are you giving it to?

319
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:09,509
You Want to see?

320
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:15,385
Take this.
- And do What?

321
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,713
Look through it. This bracelet
is for Whoever you see in it

322
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,721
Goodness! Sumitra?

323
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:35,837
"Is she the one? Are you mad?
- Yes, but not entirely. Look up"

324
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,533
That's Parvati.
- Nice?

325
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:45,748
"Yes nice, but I see her every day.
- Do you see her as my bride?"

326
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,746
Wretched girl!
- NoW What's up?

327
00:36:50,655 --> 00:36:53,419
Staring at me through binoculars!
- Goodness

328
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:58,492
She's gone hiding.
- She must be embarrassed

329
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:04,691
Been chatting over binoculars?
- Yes Badi-Ma

330
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:07,869
"Take a look,
What's the Wretch upto?"

331
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:13,706
Goodness! She's Watching me
out of the corner of her eyes

332
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:16,307
Ran

333
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,714
"Have you run in too, Dev?"

334
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:40,868
Wretched boy

335
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:47,835
HoW to make mountains
out of a molehill...

336
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:52,740
I'll shoW my mother-in-laW.
Chhoto-Ma...

337
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:04,760
So you got caught peeping.
- You got caught too

338
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:08,497
And I Was sentenced
to punish you

339
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:12,829
For you

340
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:15,104
What?
- Gift

341
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:17,269
You might as Well put it on me

342
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:20,377
So many bangles

343
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:22,401
Silly

344
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:23,410
Forget it

345
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:26,707
"Tell me, Where is London?
- Way West"

346
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:29,952
Where sets the Sun?
- In the West

347
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,722
The Sun rises over London
five hours late every day?

348
00:38:33,224 --> 00:38:35,385
Yes
- Is that Why you're late...

349
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:37,718
about understanding everything?
- Yes...

350
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:42,389
Dolt from London! Can't even
take my bangles off

351
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:44,725
HoW Will you ever make me Wear
a bracelet?

352
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:15,360
My cruel lover is heartless

353
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:24,899
My cruel lover is so heartless...

354
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:31,381
"he doesn't even knoW hoW I pine,
he's just a ruthless slaver..."

355
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:33,707
"oh cruel, please..."

356
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:42,289
"HoW do I say this,
Whom do I tell?"

357
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:48,290
"God, he doesn't knoW hoW I hurt..."

358
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,530
he knoWs not...

359
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:55,805
hoW heartless

360
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:34,139
"You Were far aWay,
yet so close..."

361
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:38,040
"noW you're close
yet distant?"

362
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:40,713
"I don't knoW...
yet I knoW"

363
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:47,422
"You Were far aWay, yet so close...
noW you're close, yet distant?"

364
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:51,484
Come...

365
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:52,991
to me

366
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:58,829
Adorn me With the bangle
- Let me read your palm

367
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,429
Don't tease me
- Lots of money

368
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:05,801
NoW don't...
- Your marriage

369
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:08,339
Do my bidding
- You'll marry an old man

370
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,671
HoW do I say this...
- About your Wedding

371
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:14,348
Whom do I tell... God
- You'll never marry

372
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:24,258
"Fool, he doesn't even knoW..."

373
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:28,096
he just doesn't knoW

374
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,027
Shame!

375
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:28,082
You see hoW the childhood love
blossoms into youthful romance?

376
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:33,022
"For all Sumitra's "Shondesh",
do send a sWeet message to Sumitra"

377
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:37,361
"Tell her, Paro has come of age"

378
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:42,696
What are you upto?

379
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:49,502
What am I upto?

380
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:55,818
What's up? What's Wrong With Ma?
- Your mother has gone mad.

381
00:42:56,354 --> 00:43:03,658
Yes! Mad With joy. Because no more
Will I dream the dream I dreamt

382
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:07,096
And Why?
- Because it's coming true

383
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:11,333
"Ma, What dream?
- Which dream? Silly!"

384
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:15,469
"I'm invited to a huge mansion.
- I knoW, Kumud has conceived"

385
00:43:15,806 --> 00:43:21,676
"Also, Kaushalya-Didi Wants to see
me. She says, Paro has come of age"

386
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:25,346
We ought to think
about Paro's Wedding

387
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:33,356
"True Paro, When you step into
that house in bridal finery..."

388
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:38,822
"there Will be dreams in your eyes,
under the veil draWn over your face"

389
00:43:39,563 --> 00:43:44,023
But We'll listen in joyous rapture
for the chime in your anklets

390
00:43:55,646 --> 00:44:03,212
Mr Landlord! So hoW do I look?
- Where's Paro? Isn't she going?

391
00:44:03,654 --> 00:44:07,454
"So long she aWaited this evening,
she Was dressed and raring to go"

392
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:11,454
"In time to leave, she shies aWay.
Off to the lake to fetch Water"

393
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:14,320
"Why?
- Silly girl, she's afraid..."

394
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,657
that I might discuss her marriage
right in front of her

395
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:22,932
Don't you raise the topic Sumitra
- The auspicious time runs out at 7

396
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:25,834
"By then if she hasn't raised
the topic, I shall"

397
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:33,981
"But don't Worry. The ansWer
Won't be a "no". Bless me"

398
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:39,252
The guests are all here.
Where is Sumitra-Kaki?

399
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:44,354
Dreaming of Paro's Wedding.
To Devdas. You knoW...

400
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:47,687
I've found a nice match for Paro.
- Who?

401
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:51,497
Old Mr Chattopadhyay

402
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,901
"My compliments, sister!
Best Wishes for a grandson"

403
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:03,975
"Don't overdo it, Sumitra.
There's still time to go"

404
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:07,113
"Only a feW months, no?"

405
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:10,648
Then the baby's Wails
Will resonate through the mansion

406
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:16,319
"Not sister, I'll call you grandma.
- You should get Paro married soon"

407
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:22,656
I'd like to call you grannie too.
- That's What I'm here to discuss

408
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:28,367
I must discuss something too. Girls
in your family fetch a bride price?

409
00:45:28,773 --> 00:45:34,075
"No, that Was olden custom.
We Will give our Paro aWay"

410
00:45:34,445 --> 00:45:39,314
So it's final. I'll give Paro aWay
in Wedding. All the expense is mine

411
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:43,346
"Paro is my daughter too.
- No, giving the daughter aWay..."

412
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:47,487
"is a dream every parent dreams.
About the expense, We can share it"

413
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:51,316
"Then it's decided, Sumitra.
- Really Didi?"

414
00:45:51,695 --> 00:45:54,357
"Yes, really.
- Therefore Kaki-Ma, you Will be..."

415
00:45:54,698 --> 00:46:00,364
the master of ceremonies tonight.
A stunning dance for the guests?

416
00:46:00,704 --> 00:46:03,036
"Oh no, not I...
- Why not? Don't you belong..."

417
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:09,142
"to a family of theatre dancers?
- Yes Didi, but that Was ages ago"

418
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,385
"No Kaki-Ma, no excuses.
Tonight you sing and you dance"

419
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:20,383
"No dear, not I...
- Are you embarrassed? Just imagine"

420
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:25,718
"You're dancing at Paro's Wedding.
- NoW I can't refuse, can I?"

421
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,225
So be it. Radha and Krishna
and love divine

422
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:36,329
Dearest love

423
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:43,707
The Moon alone...

424
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,941
in night's embrace...

425
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:55,685
"in moonlight vigil,
night's desire..."

426
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:13,359
"sang run-jhun run-jhun
"a breezing gust..."

427
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:16,002
into a radiant night...

428
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,433
"rode in fireflies
on a palanquin of stars..."

429
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:26,043
"as the Word played
on stilled lips"

430
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,441
"Then to the cadence
of drums and cymbals..."

431
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:30,710
"the duffle Was struck...
then..."

432
00:48:31,055 --> 00:48:33,046
into the rhythm sWayed...

433
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,381
my lovely Radha

434
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:40,425
Into the rhythm Radha sWayed

435
00:48:40,764 --> 00:48:45,724
"Then he came from noWhere
and he said... I love you"

436
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:49,738
Dear love...

437
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:54,471
oh but I'm afraid

438
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:29,112
Oh dearest love

439
00:50:07,685 --> 00:50:11,678
"No, not my Wrist..."

440
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:16,683
"oh, hoW shameful"

441
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:21,697
Leave me...

442
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,827
I beg of you

443
00:50:27,404 --> 00:50:30,862
"No, don't force me..."

444
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,371
spare me

445
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:36,703
Dear love

446
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,279
No...

447
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:41,708
I'll curse you for this

448
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:43,713
Madman! Go aWay

449
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:45,180
Don't torment me

450
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:47,319
Oh dearest love...

451
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,926
dear love...

452
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:55,659
oh but I'm afraid

453
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:11,075
Love me

454
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:16,342
On the banks of the Yamuna...

455
00:51:16,687 --> 00:51:19,155
"Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love"

456
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:26,219
"Of desire in their hearts
rose a song to their lips"

457
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:28,588
"Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love"

458
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:35,362
"Thirsting in every breath,
searing passion in their hearts..."

459
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:37,697
"Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love"

460
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:46,412
"The Word on stilled lips,
Krishna and Radha are in love"

461
00:52:06,837 --> 00:52:08,327
What is this?

462
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:10,663
The token of betrothal...

463
00:52:11,475 --> 00:52:15,377
of my daughter to your son.
Paro and Devdas

464
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:25,252
"Are you in your senses, Sumitra?
I invited mother and daughter..."

465
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:29,216
to entertain my guests
With some melodrama

466
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:32,385
"Instead, you are out
to Work magic?"

467
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:40,034
"Kumud, you Were right!
Sumitra-Kaki's timing is opportune"

468
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:44,369
She does knoWs hoW to
take advantage of opportunity

469
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:48,708
"As a child, her daughter stole
guavas from our orchards"

470
00:52:49,713 --> 00:52:55,879
"NoW she sets her sights on my son?
- No Didi, that isn't true"

471
00:52:56,653 --> 00:52:59,451
Devdas and Paro Were
childhood sWeethearts

472
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,384
"They are in love, they can't live
Without each other"

473
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:08,460
"In a large family, maybe you never
noticed. But I knoW hoW they yearn"

474
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:13,998
"Please do not refuse Didi,
even if it means..."

475
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:16,362
that you Will have nothing more
to do With me afterWards

476
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:22,669
Why draW Water from poisoned Wells?
You may not betray the traits

477
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:26,039
"But your genes remain the same,
that of the dancing girls"

478
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:28,374
"Yes, We landlords eat fish..."

479
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:31,347
but We Won't let bones
stick in the gullet

480
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:35,681
"For one, you are a neighbour.
Worse, as a family, disgraced"

481
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:41,692
"Even if you may momentarily forget
your disgrace, but your standing?"

482
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:45,225
Don't you try to palm off
your bad coin

483
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:51,701
"Chhoto-Ma, let it pass Chhoto-Ma.
We can alWays talk Dev out of it"

484
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:59,213
"Which leaves Parvati. If she can't
contain herself, send her to Dev"

485
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,175
Honour among landlords
isn't sullied by such affairs

486
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:08,455
Unbecoming of a landlord's Woman!
Don't interfere When elders speak

487
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:13,660
Enough! Replying to you
is beneath my dignity

488
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:20,667
"My sister you Were.
From noW on, merely Kaushalya"

489
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:27,134
"And Kaushalya, you too sang
the day my daughter Was born"

490
00:54:28,378 --> 00:54:31,677
Remember Badi-Ma? She took
my daughter from my arms...

491
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:37,009
"saying Paro Was her daughter!
With a smile, I had even said yes"

492
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:40,356
Little did I knoW that even
in the big landlord's mansion...

493
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:44,354
a lady of the house could be
so narroW-minded...

494
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:48,392
as to count guavas stolen
from one of her orchards

495
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:53,692
"Count, hoW many guavas did
my daughter steal? Tell me"

496
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:58,968
Counting guavas?
By the count of it...

497
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:04,804
I've fed your son many more times
than your count of stolen guava

498
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,908
Stolen

499
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:14,186
"And the disgrace?
Yes, We do sell our daughters"

500
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:19,325
"But you trade too, Kaushalya.
We sell our daughters, openly"

501
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:22,655
But you sWalloW the doWries
and the daughters too

502
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:31,198
"Good or bad, the coin is knoWn by
it's tinkle. But you Wouldn't knoW"

503
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:37,336
Because you're deaf enough
not to knoW your son's heart

504
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:41,777
"Blind you are, that you
do not see their love"

505
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:46,919
NoW soon you Will stand dumbstruck
in Witness your son's ruination

506
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:58,267
"I sWear, my daughter Will marry
into a family richer than yours"

507
00:55:58,702 --> 00:56:05,699
"In a Week. If I fail, then come,
mourn my death on day eight"

508
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:11,374
I came to Wish that you Would beget
a handsome son

509
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:18,712
But all I can Wish is to see
that a daughter you be given

510
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:40,403
I hear your mother
is giving you aWay...

511
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:44,544
into a rich family.
Do you knoW your husband's name?

512
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:49,114
Devdas.
- Even after all that happened...

513
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,978
Will Dev marry you?
- I'll ask him and I'll tell you

514
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:57,259
Is there anything left to ask?
She Was insulted so gravely

515
00:56:57,694 --> 00:57:01,687
"Dev didn't insult her, did he?
- Will you Walk up..."

516
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:04,796
to ask Dev to marry you?
Won't that be embarrassing?

517
00:57:05,135 --> 00:57:08,696
Why be embarrassed about asking
for What is yours?

518
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:17,005
"You're married, yet you don't
knoW What a husband means?"

519
00:57:47,444 --> 00:57:49,241
Who?
- I

520
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:19,270
Are you all right?

521
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:23,041
So late at night?
In the dark?

522
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:29,378
"Weren't you afraid?
- No, noW I'm afraid of no one"

523
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:33,712
"Not even of being maligned?
- No, When I am With you..."

524
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:38,824
I don't even care about getting
a bad name

525
00:58:40,463 --> 00:58:45,196
Why... here... noW?
- Why does the river head to sea?

526
00:58:45,735 --> 00:58:48,295
Why does the sunfloWer
alWays face the Sun?

527
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:51,730
And Why comes Paro
heedless of her dignity?

528
00:58:52,075 --> 00:58:55,340
Why unheeding my family honour
do I venture out in dark of night?

529
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:00,673
"Why do I seek refuge at your feet?
To all questions, a single ansWer"

530
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:05,683
"For the same reply, far too many
questions asking to be ansWered"

531
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:09,358
"There are no questions,
not as long as We're together"

532
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:14,696
That's What they don't Want.
- What do you Want?

533
00:59:15,365 --> 00:59:17,026
"Happiness, for you"

534
00:59:19,569 --> 00:59:22,697
But my father Won't look at it
from our perspective

535
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:26,198
We'll Win him over

536
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:32,278
What if he doesn't relent?

537
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:38,018
"Where there's love, there's no fear.
- Where there's smoke there's fire"

538
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:43,150
"In fires of attrition,
I don't Want us..."

539
00:59:43,593 --> 00:59:46,528
"to be consumed.
- I'm doomed, in any case"

540
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:49,730
"Be it With you, or Without you"

541
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:58,137
Let me drop you home.
- You're coming With me?

542
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:02,345
Without fear of censure?

543
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:22,495
Even the cur is Wary of the door
it's kicked out of

544
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,696
"What you can't get aWay With by
light of the day, you try by night?"

545
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:30,704
"Why don't you, mother and daughter
start a brothel?"

546
01:00:37,514 --> 01:00:41,473
Not even a pimp Would advise
his daughter to do that

547
01:00:53,663 --> 01:00:57,827
"With the lamp,
I saW you burn for Devdas"

548
01:00:58,668 --> 01:01:04,004
I treasure your feelings. Were you
to have asked me before leaving...

549
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:09,335
I Would not even mind if you Were
to have been Whore for a night

550
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,672
"Ma, I just Went to ask him!
- And received What in reply?"

551
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:20,946
"Not alone, you carried With you,
the honour of our family"

552
01:01:22,425 --> 01:01:25,917
Have you left your honour behind?

553
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:33,695
Let it pass Babu-ji. Why make
a mountain out of a molehill?

554
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:37,369
"By the Way, What to do
about Paro's shaWI?"

555
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:41,700
Tell him to return it.
This marriage isn't happening

556
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:44,203
I shall do no such thing

557
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:49,514
You forget Whom you are addressing

558
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:58,353
A hot-headed landlord Who Will send
his felloW-man's daughter...

559
01:01:58,762 --> 01:02:02,323
to a brothel.
- Gentlemen's daughters...

560
01:02:02,665 --> 01:02:06,328
never steal out of
neighbours' rooms at 2 am

561
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:13,338
So great Was her compulsion
and it Was you Who compelled her

562
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:18,544
I Will brook no argument from you.
- Nor do I Wish to talk to you

563
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:21,015
It's decided

564
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:28,384
Our family ranks far higher
than theirs

565
01:02:31,694 --> 01:02:36,688
"Yet, it's the same food We eat?
- Our hierarchy, status, standing"

566
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:41,397
Even the British government
is informed of us

567
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:46,964
"Yet, the same soil We tread upon?
- The bird that soars..."

568
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:51,246
can never have any relationship
With fish in the Waters

569
01:02:51,581 --> 01:02:55,642
"Yet, man on Earth relates
to God in Heaven?"

570
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:17,467
Stop Dev

571
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:20,674
"Dev, everything can be resolved.
I'll talk to Babu-ji"

572
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:23,376
But don't leave the house.
- No DWij

573
01:03:23,746 --> 01:03:25,304
Childishness!

574
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:28,014
"Over something so trivial?
- Trivial for you, not for me"

575
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:30,343
Not for me a life praying
for every breath

576
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:33,417
"Dev, We'll talk to Babu-ji...
- Stop Dev"

577
01:03:33,756 --> 01:03:37,021
Dev stop.
- Stop! Listen to me

578
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:39,156
"Stop him, Kumud"

579
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:42,695
You aren't going anywhere. Your
mother is talking to the master

580
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:45,023
Everything Will be fine.
- No Dharamdas

581
01:03:45,368 --> 01:03:48,235
"The tempest ought to pass.
If I stay on, much Will be undone"

582
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:49,560
Listen to me

583
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,033
Lady...

584
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:53,136
"Dev is leaving, Paro"

585
01:03:54,344 --> 01:03:59,179
It's as much his test as it is
yours. See for yourself...

586
01:03:59,582 --> 01:04:03,313
"What he cares for, you or family?
Is he taking you With him?"

587
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:06,315
Or is he deserting you?
If he isn't taking you along...

588
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:09,819
then you shall do
your mother's bidding

589
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:14,027
Stop Deva! I Won't let you leave!

590
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:17,458
Stop.
- Out of my Way

591
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:44,383
"That night, all sense
of reasoning deserted me"

592
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:47,355
"I Was left vacillating
as if betWeen pendulous scales"

593
01:04:47,697 --> 01:04:51,861
"You Wouldn't Want me to displease
my father to make you happy..."

594
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:54,636
Would you?

595
01:04:55,638 --> 01:05:01,440
"Why does the river go to sea?
Why the sunfloWer gazes at the sun?"

596
01:05:02,545 --> 01:05:07,346
"Instead of hunting ansWers,
Why not let the question pass?"

597
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:14,148
"What Was betWeen us, Was no more
than childishness. There's no love"

598
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:17,319
"From noW onWards,
you are the girl next-door"

599
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,821
"And I, your friend"

600
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:25,658
"Paro, get dressed, come doWnstairs.
Hurry. Your in-laWs are here"

601
01:05:36,446 --> 01:05:40,974
"My love! Oh Why did you
leave me smouldering?"

602
01:05:41,684 --> 01:05:44,380
Why did you snub out the flame?

603
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:52,020
Ei Dev...

604
01:05:52,495 --> 01:05:59,128
"Friend, you aren't asleep yet?
Are you a stranger in my home?"

605
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:06,702
"I told you before, this is
as much your home as it's mine"

606
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:10,537
"Nothing of the sort, Chuni Babu.
I'm just not feeling sleepy"

607
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:15,713
Drink up...

608
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:21,918
You knoW I don't drink.
- Then What gives?

609
01:06:22,258 --> 01:06:26,194
"If "h" is for happiness in life,
Why are you so looking so harassed?"

610
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:31,967
So harried as not to feel at home?
- Nothing of the sort

611
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:33,394
But something surely is!

612
01:06:33,736 --> 01:06:37,263
"The "h" that makes a home
is the same that spells hurt"

613
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:40,740
Fought With your parents?
- No

614
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:43,904
Or are you nursing
a Wounded heart?

615
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:54,056
My point! That's my point!
H for heart and for hurt

616
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:57,359
"And the tWo are related
so closely my friend, oh-so-closely"

617
01:06:57,694 --> 01:07:00,356
"Hindustan or English-stan,
everywhere it's all the same"

618
01:07:00,697 --> 01:07:07,694
H for heart and for hurt.
- Have you suffered no pain?

619
01:07:08,404 --> 01:07:13,273
Ask not of one Time has Weathered
What pain each nuance hides...

620
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,474
for men may see but no more
than a smiling face

621
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:22,284
You knoW What I make family With.
Just me and my Wealth

622
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,052
And therefore it Was
that I adopted music

623
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:31,721
"The "Thumri" for my daughter,
and the "Dadra", my son"

624
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:43,230
"The "W" in Words is tricky, making for
Warmth, Worn, Wealth, Worlds, Wisdom..."

625
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:51,738
Wastrels and Wishes. Worship too.
A Well-Wisher and your Waywardness

626
01:07:54,250 --> 01:08:01,486
Get over this insanity and let's
go aWay. Way aWay. I feel Walled-in

627
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:11,691
"But Chuni Babu, Where to?
- Wherever you Wish"

628
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:14,259
Where you go every night

629
01:08:17,507 --> 01:08:21,375
"There, Where the anklets tinkle?"

630
01:08:58,815 --> 01:09:02,376
"HoW are you ladies?
Look, Whom I've brought to you"

631
01:09:02,618 --> 01:09:06,611
Who is it?
- My classmate from London

632
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:11,617
"Where are you lost Dev Babu?
Come, here too I hold court"

633
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:14,853
"Welcome my friend, enter"

634
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:58,497
Chandramukhi

635
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:05,338
Your mirror couldn't bear to see
my face. I'm sorry for your loss

636
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:14,022
"If sorroW be joy's harbinger, every
loss signals What gain shall be?"

637
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:19,617
Wonderful Chandramukhi!
Even your Words are so seductive

638
01:10:21,931 --> 01:10:27,096
"But do use the kohl, to Ward off
the stranger's evil eye"

639
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:32,638
You are much amused?
- Naturally

640
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:36,436
I see someone trying
to Ward off the evil eye...

641
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:39,342
While Women
on the marketplace...

642
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:42,641
vie to be seen

643
01:10:44,654 --> 01:10:49,387
You touch upon eyespeak
and you have stolen my heart

644
01:10:50,026 --> 01:10:54,588
"What I took for stone,
breathes the life into me"

645
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,501
"So you see Dev Babu?
On "c" and Chandramukhi..."

646
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:03,333
didn't I Warn you she's
cause of such amazement?

647
01:11:03,606 --> 01:11:06,598
"Chuni Babu also begins With a "c"

648
01:11:10,613 --> 01:11:13,411
Of c's and cause celebres
and Chandramukhi...

649
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:16,617
you saW hoW clumsy
she made me look?

650
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:56,591
Jasmine makes fragrant...

651
01:11:56,826 --> 01:11:59,989
her lovely dark tresses

652
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:04,996
"Radha's face is agloW, electric"

653
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:08,593
"Her gait, seductive"

654
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:54,980
Krishna stopped her

655
01:12:57,186 --> 01:12:59,313
He surprised Radha With a kiss

656
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:01,579
Surprised Radha With a kiss...

657
01:13:01,757 --> 01:13:02,917
With a kiss

658
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:08,794
Radha's veil Was slipping aWay

659
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:21,408
"Do not tease me,
Radha pleaded"

660
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:26,604
Why are you teasing me?

661
01:13:42,064 --> 01:13:45,625
But Krishna Was obstinate

662
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:49,631
He shamed Radha

663
01:14:01,584 --> 01:14:04,917
"That night,
Krishna Wouldn't listen"

664
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:10,989
"But Whom could Radha complain to?
Krishna Wouldn't listen"

665
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:16,821
"Oh, Why are you teasing me?"

666
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:45,391
A pot of milk...

667
01:14:45,561 --> 01:14:47,620
Radha carried on her head...

668
01:14:47,797 --> 01:14:49,628
When she heard...

669
01:14:49,698 --> 01:14:51,529
Krishna's footsteps...

670
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:53,534
and her heart...

671
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:56,901
skipped a beat

672
01:15:07,349 --> 01:15:12,912
"Radha pleaded, don't hold my arms
so hard, then her bangles broke"

673
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:37,407
But that night...

674
01:15:37,613 --> 01:15:41,606
"Whom could Radha complain to?
Krishna Wouldn't listen"

675
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:45,418
Oh stop teasing me

676
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:34,595
Mesmeric

677
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:41,770
"Where are you off to? Tarry,
the night has just come of age"

678
01:16:42,278 --> 01:16:47,409
I made a big mistake! I shouldn't
have Written that letter to Paro

679
01:16:49,618 --> 01:16:54,487
"I Want to go to Paro.
- Who's Paro? Wait, Wait for me"

680
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,794
"Bad manners, Walking out
on a performance"

681
01:17:00,963 --> 01:17:03,625
Dancing to an audience
of drunken men...

682
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:06,024
is shamelessness

683
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:14,632
"You are a Woman, Chandramukhi.
Realise Who you are"

684
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:19,444
"Woman, mother, sister,
Wife, friend"

685
01:17:20,649 --> 01:17:22,913
When she is none...

686
01:17:23,052 --> 01:17:25,043
she is Whore

687
01:17:25,654 --> 01:17:27,952
"Could you be some else,
Chandramukhi?"

688
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:33,460
Price. For our time together

689
01:17:33,996 --> 01:17:36,464
Keep it

690
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:43,661
Friend...

691
01:17:44,673 --> 01:17:48,473
"See? Someone I Wanted
to stay on, is gone"

692
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:56,609
In What are you lost?
- Such anguish in those eyes

693
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:02,856
Does anguish make you anxious?

694
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:10,423
Have courtesans no hearts?
Is she denied the right to love?

695
01:18:10,632 --> 01:18:14,966
"Of course! If there be amour,
paramour there is too"

696
01:18:15,637 --> 01:18:17,969
Will you do me a favour?
- Say it

697
01:18:18,307 --> 01:18:21,140
"For just once,
Will you bring him?"

698
01:18:21,643 --> 01:18:26,637
"Promise, I cannot. But try, I shall.
Only for you"

699
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:32,646
Look at her! Paro is as resplendent
as the Moon tonight

700
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:40,857
"Had Devdas been here,
he'd knoW What he has lost"

701
01:18:41,196 --> 01:18:43,130
My Paro is lucky

702
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:45,562
Her Wedding procession is coming
all the Way from Manikpur...

703
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,999
like a train of lights.
- You haven't seen it

704
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:51,538
The bride's mother must not Watch
her daughter's Wedding procession

705
01:18:51,774 --> 01:18:54,402
Lest the mother gives
the bride the evil eye

706
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:58,942
And after tonight no one Will ever
call her Paro

707
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,345
Just Parvati

708
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:04,414
Kaki-Ma (Kaki Ma: Aunt)

709
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:07,918
Is Paro in?

710
01:19:13,362 --> 01:19:16,024
The Wedding procession
is about to arrive

711
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:20,033
"You can see her.
Let's go, Manorama"

712
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:31,245
I'm back Paro

713
01:19:32,014 --> 01:19:35,643
Why?
- I've come back to you. Forever

714
01:19:36,251 --> 01:19:38,651
When my Wedding procession
is at my door?

715
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:47,457
There's still time. I'll convince
my parents. I'll tell them...

716
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:53,331
Your parents! Haven't I?
If honour matters to your family...

717
01:19:53,569 --> 01:19:57,096
doesn't honour matter to us?
Your father may be a landlord

718
01:19:57,606 --> 01:20:03,272
Doesn't my father count? No matter
hoW loWly We bride-sellers are...

719
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,615
"We never cheat anyone.
- I never cheated you, Paro"

720
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:11,115
Then Why did you leave me?
And that letter?

721
01:20:11,386 --> 01:20:15,288
"Paro you knoW, your Dev never does
anything deliberately"

722
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:18,623
I Was naive

723
01:20:19,628 --> 01:20:25,294
"Naivete! HoW naive can you be Dev?
On a Whim, you give me a bracelet?"

724
01:20:25,634 --> 01:20:28,899
"On a Whim, you Write saying
there's no love lost! Naivete?"

725
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:34,371
Paro forever... another Whim?
- Paro! Your Wedding procession

726
01:20:37,446 --> 01:20:39,437
Time to part

727
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:44,181
I don't accept this marriage!
- What difference? I accept

728
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:51,458
"Then, I'm going to tell everyone...
- I Went to see you at 2 am"

729
01:20:52,394 --> 01:20:56,160
You Want to malign me?
- I... malign you?

730
01:20:56,598 --> 01:21:00,090
HoW could you think?
If you ever say that again...

731
01:21:00,235 --> 01:21:03,500
What Will you do? Hit me?
Ever since I Was a child...

732
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:07,268
have you held me in fief?
And When I ask for my right...

733
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:11,209
you do a volte face?
- Enough! Stop it Paro

734
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:15,944
Such vanity is no good.
- Why should I not be vain?

735
01:21:16,618 --> 01:21:20,281
"What are you Dev,
but Wealthy and handsome?"

736
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:25,619
"I possess virtues, beauty.
And after tonight, riches too"

737
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:28,629
"From noW on, I am more
than an equal to you"

738
01:21:29,031 --> 01:21:32,967
"If you be a landlord, I take pride
in being an aristocrat"

739
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:41,899
Such vanity?

740
01:21:42,644 --> 01:21:48,640
Not even the Moon is as vain.
- But the Moon is scarred

741
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:07,592
What have you done?

742
01:22:09,605 --> 01:22:16,408
"I have scarred you, like the Moon.
With the mark of my love"

743
01:22:51,546 --> 01:22:55,983
On joyous night...

744
01:22:57,019 --> 01:23:02,924
"When her bridal procession
arrived..."

745
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:06,922
"sloWly, a sea of sorroW..."

746
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:10,288
"rose, stilled in her eyes"

747
01:23:10,832 --> 01:23:13,596
To lilting lutes...

748
01:23:14,202 --> 01:23:20,004
her eyes told the tale

749
01:23:25,714 --> 01:23:28,376
"AIWays, it Was you I loved..."

750
01:23:28,617 --> 01:23:31,415
and I loved and I loved...

751
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:35,021
and I loved forever

752
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:47,625
"Forever I have longed for you
as I have longed for nothing else"

753
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:53,837
My heart has Worshipped you...

754
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:57,306
Worshipped you and Worshipped...

755
01:23:57,746 --> 01:24:00,977
and Worshipped but none else

756
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:05,382
Never...

757
01:24:05,754 --> 01:24:10,589
"never, never, never..."

758
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:12,750
and none else

759
01:24:56,872 --> 01:25:00,035
SorroW clouds a joy...

760
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:03,476
shades of anguish darken her...

761
01:25:03,678 --> 01:25:06,738
as she goes to tell her beloved...

762
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:10,315
only to tell her beloved

763
01:25:13,522 --> 01:25:19,586
The Wound you have left me With...

764
01:25:20,829 --> 01:25:26,597
only adds to my beauty

765
01:25:27,335 --> 01:25:33,604
"My Wound I Will preserve
as your mark..."

766
01:25:33,942 --> 01:25:40,404
that anoints my forehead

767
01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:42,477
My beloved...

768
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:44,084
oh beloved...

769
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:46,210
Without you...

770
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:48,412
my life is incomplete...

771
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:50,420
vacuous...

772
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:52,422
empty...

773
01:25:53,728 --> 01:25:55,992
my life is empty...

774
01:26:08,743 --> 01:26:12,076
"Carrying memories
of moments past..."

775
01:26:12,314 --> 01:26:15,442
"With burdened steps
she Walks..."

776
01:26:15,584 --> 01:26:18,382
her heart cries...

777
01:26:18,653 --> 01:26:21,588
her eyes Weep...

778
01:26:21,957 --> 01:26:25,290
her heart...

779
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:28,085
resonates

780
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:31,963
Childhood memories...

781
01:26:35,937 --> 01:26:38,269
of relationships...

782
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:41,601
sWinging in the rain...

783
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:44,201
smiling...

784
01:26:44,346 --> 01:26:46,007
draWing laughter...

785
01:26:46,114 --> 01:26:49,015
"annoyed, being placated"

786
01:26:49,351 --> 01:26:52,411
Every moment...

787
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:54,712
etched into my heart...

788
01:26:54,823 --> 01:26:56,620
in the flames of my lamp...

789
01:26:56,825 --> 01:27:02,957
I am carrying...

790
01:27:03,298 --> 01:27:06,631
aWay

791
01:27:06,801 --> 01:27:09,634
My beloved...

792
01:27:09,971 --> 01:27:11,632
Without you...

793
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:17,645
my life is nothing...

794
01:27:19,648 --> 01:27:21,912
nothing at all

795
01:27:27,656 --> 01:27:30,454
"AIWays, you I loved..."

796
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:32,650
and I loved and I loved...

797
01:27:32,761 --> 01:27:34,422
and I loved forever

798
01:27:37,999 --> 01:27:41,332
"I loved, loved, loved"

799
01:27:44,673 --> 01:27:48,074
"You, I loved and loved"

800
01:27:51,513 --> 01:27:54,607
I loved and loved

801
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:01,953
Only loved and loved and loved

802
01:28:27,148 --> 01:28:31,448
Deva! Open up!
What are you doing?

803
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:36,187
Open up! What madness is this?
- For my sake! Open up

804
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:40,451
I said it! Don't tear Deva and Paro
apart! But Who listens to me?

805
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:43,391
What's going on?
- Look! Tell him something

806
01:28:43,665 --> 01:28:47,658
"Narayan, tell him.
- No point. Leave him alone"

807
01:28:48,069 --> 01:28:50,663
The fire Will die doWn on its oWn.
- But look...

808
01:29:00,315 --> 01:29:02,977
Time plays games With everyone

809
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:08,282
My daughter treads upon silver noW!
But look...

810
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:12,285
Iook at your son. It's your pride
that he sets afire

811
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:15,291
TWo acts to the melodrama!

812
01:29:16,031 --> 01:29:18,625
In Act One
my daughter and I danced

813
01:29:19,634 --> 01:29:23,229
Act TWo
NoW you and your son Will dance

814
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:51,928
Why is the neW bride so dejected?
- Because last night...

815
01:29:52,033 --> 01:29:55,400
husband and bride slept apart.
- That's for the first night

816
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:57,594
It's said to be ominous.
But it's over

817
01:29:57,772 --> 01:30:00,400
"From tonight, man and Wife
Will sleep together"

818
01:30:02,877 --> 01:30:04,868
Are you harassing the bride?

819
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,071
Sit...
sit Parvati

820
01:30:07,682 --> 01:30:13,780
"You knoW, We had everything here,
but the Moon. And noW you're here"

821
01:30:16,324 --> 01:30:18,622
NoW you are
the lady of the manor

822
01:30:18,993 --> 01:30:20,984
Also a mother
to these children

823
01:30:23,164 --> 01:30:25,428
"From his first Wife,
Bhuvan has three children"

824
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:29,635
"Your son, Mahendra.
- Obeisances, Chhoti-Ma"

825
01:30:30,672 --> 01:30:34,631
"And our youngest, little Kalika.
- My obeisances, Chhoti-Ma"

826
01:30:35,276 --> 01:30:37,267
"And Yashomati, the eldest"

827
01:30:37,946 --> 01:30:42,212
She's angry. You must placate her

828
01:30:42,784 --> 01:30:44,547
And all of you...

829
01:30:44,652 --> 01:30:47,450
you must adorn
the bride exquisitely...

830
01:30:47,789 --> 01:30:50,053
for her nuptial night

831
01:30:54,395 --> 01:30:56,386
Have you familiarised yourself
With the manor?

832
01:30:56,598 --> 01:31:00,329
"Yes.
- You have my Word, Parvati..."

833
01:31:00,668 --> 01:31:04,195
"in this manor, you Will have
no problems about anything"

834
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:06,934
Except one

835
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:11,605
It is difficult to bide time here.
- Oh but time flies here

836
01:31:12,046 --> 01:31:18,610
I do not understand?
- A While ago I Was a neW bride

837
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:22,285
"And in no time, I'm Chhoti-Ma
(Chhoti-Ma: Little Mother)"

838
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:27,024
"From bride to "little Mother",
I'm transformed. In no time"

839
01:31:27,395 --> 01:31:32,094
I Wish to tell you something.
I married because my Ma insisted

840
01:31:33,067 --> 01:31:37,367
"My children needed a mother,
and this manor needs a lady"

841
01:31:38,973 --> 01:31:40,964
And you?

842
01:31:43,645 --> 01:31:47,172
Subhadra... Was my first Wife

843
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:51,915
"You're noW the lady of the manor,
the mother of my children..."

844
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:57,591
"and my neW bride, no doubt.
But Subhadra, I can never forget"

845
01:31:58,593 --> 01:32:03,929
"The ominous first night may be over.
But We Will stay distanced, forever"

846
01:32:05,066 --> 01:32:09,264
"My mistake or my sin,
call it What you may..."

847
01:32:09,771 --> 01:32:11,762
but do forgive me

848
01:32:27,322 --> 01:32:31,019
"Good morning friend, good morning.
You're lucky, my friend"

849
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:34,293
I ask help of the spirits
to knock me out of my senses

850
01:32:34,529 --> 01:32:38,431
You Won't even touch the spirits
and yet you are inebriated?

851
01:32:39,167 --> 01:32:46,130
You missed telling me? Or made
a pariah of me? Paro and paramour

852
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:50,640
"Both spelt With "p"! Your stupor
has unravelled all your secrets"

853
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,014
Who brought me here?

854
01:32:54,582 --> 01:33:00,578
"My lover
is so faithless"

855
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:06,989
"HoW regrettable, to be rescued
off the streets by a prostitute"

856
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:15,330
This one is an ingrate Chuni Babu!
Bites me for the love I gave him

857
01:33:15,603 --> 01:33:20,006
My Word! She helped you out of
humane concern. You Were sick

858
01:33:20,174 --> 01:33:25,009
"She picked you up from the streets.
You've come to, after tWo days"

859
01:33:25,613 --> 01:33:30,607
"She never slept a Wink, nursed you,
sat through your cries for Paro"

860
01:33:31,319 --> 01:33:34,186
Insult instead of gratitude?

861
01:33:34,422 --> 01:33:41,294
Let it pass. It's a landlord trait.
Never mind their little trespasses

862
01:33:42,797 --> 01:33:47,632
"You left as if, forever.
But as luck Would have it..."

863
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:51,034
I find you once again.
Medicine...

864
01:33:51,973 --> 01:33:54,373
you need it. NoW

865
01:33:56,644 --> 01:34:00,171
"Your medicine, I don't need.
I'd rather have lain there"

866
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:05,985
Just fall unconscious once again.
I'll dump you Where I found you

867
01:34:06,254 --> 01:34:08,245
Yes Chuni Babu?

868
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:14,588
What is this?
- Chuni Babu says...

869
01:34:14,996 --> 01:34:19,262
you've been here for tWo nights.
Lamps in your boudoir Went unlit

870
01:34:20,068 --> 01:34:23,401
This is price. For tWo nights
you Wasted on me

871
01:34:28,609 --> 01:34:32,409
"NoW I knoW,
Why Paro abandoned you"

872
01:34:33,614 --> 01:34:37,277
"Let alone love,
you don't even deserve sympathy"

873
01:34:38,086 --> 01:34:42,420
Hear Chuni Babu?
A courtesan talking of romance

874
01:34:43,624 --> 01:34:48,789
"Am I to learn of her What love is,
What romance be? What is amour?"

875
01:34:49,097 --> 01:34:54,899
"Love mirrored in your soul, amour
God's gift to life's design, romance"

876
01:34:57,672 --> 01:35:02,769
HoW regrettable Chuni Babu
Your friend possesses none...

877
01:35:03,111 --> 01:35:06,171
"of soul, or intent or purpose"

878
01:35:06,848 --> 01:35:10,579
That thing you flash
time and again Dev Babu...

879
01:35:11,386 --> 01:35:14,116
"the money, it lies at the feet
of harlots in brothels"

880
01:35:14,956 --> 01:35:20,588
"If you be so vain, return to me
What I spent on you"

881
01:35:21,662 --> 01:35:23,323
TWo nights

882
01:35:23,598 --> 01:35:28,399
"You oWe me 2 nights, Dev Babu.
No more shall I dance..."

883
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:33,597
not until you come.
These eyes Will aWait you

884
01:35:37,645 --> 01:35:44,608
"F for friendship, she came seeking,
you found a foe. You oWe tWo nights"

885
01:35:46,754 --> 01:35:49,951
O'faithless lover

886
01:35:58,266 --> 01:36:00,257
Music plays

887
01:36:01,169 --> 01:36:03,160
Let slip the veil

888
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,165
Let the revelry begin

889
01:36:08,576 --> 01:36:16,574
"Revelry aWaits you, Chandramukhi.
- No, not until Dev Babu arrives"

890
01:36:20,288 --> 01:36:23,985
"Pure gold.
Custom made, in LucknoW"

891
01:36:24,926 --> 01:36:26,860
I also have a gold nose ring

892
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:29,929
I Wish to tie the dancing bells
to your feet

893
01:36:31,599 --> 01:36:34,830
Do Wear the nose ring and
alloW me to unscreW it afterWards

894
01:36:35,069 --> 01:36:41,065
Desist from such ardour Kali Babu.
Get too close and you Will burn...

895
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:44,407
in the very lamps that light up
nights of revelry

896
01:36:45,012 --> 01:36:49,608
At the next instance of insolence
I'll give you a nose ring and...

897
01:36:49,951 --> 01:36:52,852
the rest of the revelers
may take pleasure in unscreWing

898
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,614
In a marketplace
full of beauties...

899
01:36:55,723 --> 01:36:59,022
such spirit
is What draWs me to you

900
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:03,294
But the one you
aWait so eagerly...

901
01:37:03,698 --> 01:37:07,634
has no interest
in you or your music

902
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:15,634
It Was some Paro's firefly that ran
into your fires crying Paro-Paro

903
01:37:16,444 --> 01:37:22,644
"Never Will he return, Chandramukhi.
- He Will come, he Will Kali Babu"

904
01:37:24,652 --> 01:37:30,648
You Will see. That's from my heart.
- Why not take on a bet?

905
01:37:32,827 --> 01:37:35,660
If he doesn't come before
the candle has burnt out...

906
01:37:36,063 --> 01:37:39,055
then you Will Wear these
dancing bells...

907
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:42,568
only for my pleasure.
- I accept

908
01:37:45,373 --> 01:37:47,364
And if he comes...

909
01:37:47,675 --> 01:37:53,477
then you shall leave
Wearing these very dancing bells

910
01:37:58,686 --> 01:38:00,119
Agreed

911
01:38:30,117 --> 01:38:32,551
Whose footfall?

912
01:38:33,521 --> 01:38:35,648
Whose shadoW?

913
01:38:36,824 --> 01:38:39,156
Who knocks at my heart?

914
01:38:40,161 --> 01:38:42,652
Who is come?

915
01:38:53,841 --> 01:38:59,609
Who paints me this emerald?

916
01:39:00,248 --> 01:39:04,241
My joy...

917
01:39:06,053 --> 01:39:08,044
is killing me

918
01:40:08,916 --> 01:40:15,617
No Moon I ever desired...

919
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:22,993
nor stars I ever seeked...

920
01:40:23,364 --> 01:40:26,629
complaints I have none...

921
01:40:29,937 --> 01:40:33,634
every sorroW I have hidden...

922
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:38,368
every taunt I laughed off...

923
01:40:39,647 --> 01:40:45,313
thorns I embraced...

924
01:40:45,753 --> 01:40:51,658
their blossoms have Wounded me

925
01:40:58,599 --> 01:41:04,595
But Whenever I have prayed...

926
01:41:05,139 --> 01:41:07,403
of The Lord...

927
01:41:07,608 --> 01:41:10,600
I have alWays seeked you

928
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:27,287
Who paints me this emerald?

929
01:41:27,528 --> 01:41:30,429
Is killing me

930
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:33,623
I'm slain

931
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:18,004
You aren't accustomed to the drink.
Why drink beyond your limits?

932
01:43:22,142 --> 01:43:24,610
What fool drinks
to stay Within limits?

933
01:43:26,046 --> 01:43:28,947
I drink that I may force myself
to stay on...

934
01:43:30,885 --> 01:43:36,152
"looking at you,
tolerating you..."

935
01:43:37,791 --> 01:43:40,851
"that I may lose my senses,
to help me forget Paro"

936
01:43:41,195 --> 01:43:42,457
But Chandramukhi...

937
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:45,622
"such are memories of Paro, they
Won't even let me lose my senses"

938
01:43:48,636 --> 01:43:53,164
"Why, after all I drink, do memories
of her haunt me day and night?"

939
01:43:54,775 --> 01:43:56,367
Why...

940
01:43:57,578 --> 01:43:59,569
oh Why?

941
01:44:02,983 --> 01:44:05,577
"Why, does man become so naive?"

942
01:44:08,589 --> 01:44:10,580
Why make mistakes?

943
01:44:11,592 --> 01:44:16,393
Why... for foible...
so harsh a punishment?

944
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,591
As to be rent asunder?

945
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:26,601
"One enters matrimony,
and the other?"

946
01:44:38,619 --> 01:44:40,917
Slain

947
01:44:54,635 --> 01:44:57,763
In What fain folly...

948
01:44:58,038 --> 01:45:00,131
he forsakes the lotus?

949
01:45:00,574 --> 01:45:02,804
For a paper floWer?

950
01:45:08,048 --> 01:45:10,039
I fall...

951
01:45:13,621 --> 01:45:17,057
Touch me not!
I despise you!

952
01:45:18,058 --> 01:45:21,926
I can't bear to see Woman
come to this. Begone

953
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:28,163
Never again shall
I stand at this door

954
01:45:31,105 --> 01:45:33,869
"But yes, Whenever
I come to think of Paro, I shall"

955
01:45:34,775 --> 01:45:38,267
"And come the guilt pangs,
I shall come"

956
01:45:41,415 --> 01:45:44,179
For Where else can I go?

957
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:51,319
There... I have sentenced myself.
- Why punish yourself so?

958
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,157
"Because every day,
my heart is put to trial"

959
01:46:09,777 --> 01:46:12,245
"Every day,
this romance is tried"

960
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:19,108
"But every day,
the verdict is the same"

961
01:46:30,764 --> 01:46:32,527
You are convicted

962
01:47:11,638 --> 01:47:13,037
Paro

963
01:47:16,877 --> 01:47:21,075
Our Parvati decides Whatever
happens in the manor

964
01:47:21,949 --> 01:47:25,942
The neW bride has laid to rest
all my Worries

965
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:30,656
With Parvati's arrival our
lost days of joys are here again

966
01:47:31,658 --> 01:47:35,992
Meet Yashomati's mother-in-laW
This is Parvati

967
01:47:36,663 --> 01:47:39,154
"To Bhuvan Chaudhary,
you'd more likely be..."

968
01:47:39,399 --> 01:47:43,460
a daughter than his Wife.
- Whatever I am to him...

969
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:48,672
you and I are like sisters.
We should be embracing each other

970
01:47:48,876 --> 01:47:51,868
But you are many years
my elder

971
01:47:52,179 --> 01:47:58,345
"From What I see, in Manikpur, Wives
are better endoWed than daughters"

972
01:47:58,619 --> 01:48:03,022
"No Badi-Ma?
- Our daughters, We send aWay..."

973
01:48:03,323 --> 01:48:09,023
"in hope that they Will be cared for,
but We're disappointed. No, Badi-Ma?"

974
01:48:11,331 --> 01:48:14,630
Yashomati.
I Was eager to meet you

975
01:48:15,035 --> 01:48:19,972
We ought not to be cross With kin.
You and I are of the same age

976
01:48:20,307 --> 01:48:23,299
"So you decide,
hoW We Will relate to each other"

977
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:26,172
Mother and daughter?
Or friends?

978
01:48:28,048 --> 01:48:30,039
Ma

979
01:48:34,521 --> 01:48:38,924
"What's this, Ma? All this?
- Gifts, from your Ma"

980
01:48:39,459 --> 01:48:41,359
You'll look great

981
01:48:43,330 --> 01:48:47,266
Will you keep to your daughter?
Won't you give us company?

982
01:48:47,568 --> 01:48:53,564
I do not like the smoking pot.
- The smoking pot has pride of place

983
01:48:53,774 --> 01:48:58,211
"I don't think so, no pride in What
goes up in smoke"

984
01:48:58,412 --> 01:49:01,609
"Wonderful, mother-in-laW!
I delight in your Words"

985
01:49:02,716 --> 01:49:07,619
I have been so eager to see you.
We missed each other's Weddings

986
01:49:08,322 --> 01:49:09,880
My obeisances

987
01:49:14,828 --> 01:49:19,197
Touching your feet Was a pleasure.
I have been given my Wish

988
01:49:20,634 --> 01:49:23,296
HoW I Wish I had attended
your Wedding...

989
01:49:23,704 --> 01:49:26,901
if only to have my Wish of
pulling you up by your ear

990
01:49:28,208 --> 01:49:31,302
Pulling you up by the ear
Was a pleasure

991
01:49:33,447 --> 01:49:36,314
"This first acquaintance, I shall
alWays remember, mother-in-laW"

992
01:49:37,117 --> 01:49:39,449
Remember the relationship too

993
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:12,150
"Mr Landlord! Hurry up!
Look, Paro is here"

994
01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:14,610
Paro! HoW have you been?

995
01:50:14,688 --> 01:50:16,679
I've been expecting you for days.
- Why the croWd next-door?

996
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:19,281
Is everything all right?
- Narayan Mukherjee

997
01:50:19,426 --> 01:50:23,294
Breathing his last
- Shouldn't We be there?

998
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:25,721
My heart Won't let me

999
01:50:26,099 --> 01:50:33,028
Will you see the man Who told you
and your mother to run a brothel?

1000
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:38,643
Let not mistaken vanity
destroy relationships

1001
01:50:40,747 --> 01:50:42,977
I'm going over

1002
01:50:45,652 --> 01:50:48,177
"The entire village, all relatives
came to pay their respects"

1003
01:50:48,388 --> 01:50:54,384
But no neWs of his dear son Devdas?
HoW sad

1004
01:50:55,729 --> 01:50:58,596
And here comes someone
Who has nothing to do

1005
01:50:59,633 --> 01:51:02,397
"Look Babu-ji,
Who's here to see you"

1006
01:51:03,603 --> 01:51:04,831
Devdas?

1007
01:51:05,005 --> 01:51:07,599
"Master, your Paro is here"

1008
01:51:12,612 --> 01:51:14,944
"No, no Babu-ji"

1009
01:51:17,084 --> 01:51:22,954
"When you Were children, I'd ask you
to find Dev Whenever he Was lost"

1010
01:51:24,524 --> 01:51:28,858
"I've forfeited myself the right,
haven't I, Sumitra?"

1011
01:51:30,097 --> 01:51:32,964
"All night, he Was asking,
Where's Dev-Where's Dev?"

1012
01:51:34,434 --> 01:51:37,631
"NoW Where do I look for him,
my tempest?"

1013
01:51:45,645 --> 01:51:47,442
What happened?

1014
01:51:53,253 --> 01:51:56,381
"If I am so despicable, if my touch
be so abhorrent, then Why..."

1015
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:58,581
did you come into my life?

1016
01:51:58,959 --> 01:52:03,225
In my solitude I Was content
Why be my messiah of misery?

1017
01:52:07,701 --> 01:52:11,694
That stopped the spasm didn't it?
Divert your attentions and...

1018
01:52:11,838 --> 01:52:15,604
the deepest Wounds may be healed.
- Which is What I am upto

1019
01:52:16,676 --> 01:52:19,611
"Stop it, you've had enough"

1020
01:52:22,516 --> 01:52:28,614
Why not say I've lived enough?
- HoW could I?

1021
01:52:30,157 --> 01:52:37,086
"You have Paro, memories of Paro
All I have is you, my Midas"

1022
01:52:37,831 --> 01:52:40,425
A touch
and iron is made to gold

1023
01:52:41,902 --> 01:52:47,807
Are you pricing yourself or me?
- In a World of relationships...

1024
01:52:47,941 --> 01:52:51,638
What value a Woman
of easy virtue? Nothing

1025
01:52:52,045 --> 01:52:55,913
"Besides, you Won't even give me
the right to touch you"

1026
01:52:59,586 --> 01:53:06,583
Are you in love With me?
- Or you could ask me if I breathe

1027
01:53:09,596 --> 01:53:11,996
"You breathe, Chandramukhi?"

1028
01:53:16,236 --> 01:53:19,603
"What Will you get out of it?
I have no home, no heart"

1029
01:53:21,608 --> 01:53:28,070
"Loving isn't only about receiving.
Love, I have traded many times"

1030
01:53:28,982 --> 01:53:31,815
"But loved, I have but once"

1031
01:53:36,957 --> 01:53:40,620
"Pour more into a chalice filled,
and What happens?"

1032
01:53:42,896 --> 01:53:45,228
"It spills,
to the ground"

1033
01:53:48,635 --> 01:53:52,435
"So too my cup floWeth over,
With Paro"

1034
01:53:54,274 --> 01:53:56,902
More can only spill...

1035
01:53:57,144 --> 01:54:03,913
"to fall, and in the falling,
take you doWn too"

1036
01:54:05,886 --> 01:54:13,122
"But in the spilling, the Wine
must've been caressed by the chalice"

1037
01:54:24,004 --> 01:54:25,995
Then spill...

1038
01:54:27,607 --> 01:54:29,598
some more

1039
01:54:40,954 --> 01:54:44,412
Where is Devdas?
I must see him

1040
01:54:45,025 --> 01:54:50,429
Asleep. You can't see him noW.
- Can I not? I'm here to take him

1041
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:52,621
I'm not leaving him
in this hell

1042
01:54:55,969 --> 01:54:58,563
Master!
- Who gave you my Whereabouts?

1043
01:54:58,905 --> 01:55:00,566
Chuni Babu

1044
01:55:00,874 --> 01:55:01,863
Babu-ji...

1045
01:55:01,942 --> 01:55:05,571
Babu-ji Won't even see my face
Why has he sent you?

1046
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:10,914
"Anyway, he Will be displeased
to see me as I am"

1047
01:55:13,587 --> 01:55:17,580
Sir Narayan Mukherjee Will have
to hang his head in shame

1048
01:55:22,596 --> 01:55:26,589
"Go Dharamdas, go aWay.
- Listen Deva..."

1049
01:55:30,136 --> 01:55:32,604
Your father is no more

1050
01:56:35,602 --> 01:56:37,399
Too bad

1051
01:56:40,674 --> 01:56:44,610
All of a sudden... hoW?

1052
01:56:47,614 --> 01:56:49,605
He Was a nice man

1053
01:56:51,418 --> 01:56:53,613
Such men aren't born too often

1054
01:57:04,464 --> 01:57:06,625
Babu-ji has earned...

1055
01:57:10,303 --> 01:57:12,635
"another title, no?"

1056
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:17,039
Late Sir Narayan Mukherjee

1057
01:57:18,778 --> 01:57:21,042
We loved each other dearly

1058
01:57:22,649 --> 01:57:26,050
"But too bad, this is too bad"

1059
01:57:32,092 --> 01:57:34,652
"Late, Sir Mukherjee..."

1060
01:57:38,531 --> 01:57:40,999
Was a good man

1061
01:57:45,071 --> 01:57:48,666
Does Devdas drink every day?
- When doesn't he drink?

1062
01:57:49,075 --> 01:57:51,669
"Alcohol, day and night.
Lives on it"

1063
01:57:52,312 --> 01:57:55,941
Why don't you stop him?
- But only if he'd stay at home

1064
01:57:56,282 --> 01:57:59,513
Rarely does he come home.
There he lies in Chitpore...

1065
01:57:59,619 --> 01:58:01,985
"in Chandramukhi's brothel,
all day"

1066
01:58:02,422 --> 01:58:05,414
The room upstairs is practically
Deva's residence

1067
01:58:06,626 --> 01:58:09,288
Devdas! He lives in a brothel?

1068
01:58:11,498 --> 01:58:14,023
Such days I have lived to see

1069
01:58:14,634 --> 01:58:18,502
Have you seen Chandramukhi?
- When I Went to fetch Deva...

1070
01:58:18,638 --> 01:58:21,630
I saW her.
- What is she like?

1071
01:58:22,642 --> 01:58:28,638
"SWeet deceit, as they say.
Famous courtesan, uses her charms"

1072
01:58:28,882 --> 01:58:35,048
"She plunders, he squanders. We must
rescue our Deva from the hell, Paro"

1073
01:58:35,655 --> 01:58:39,648
"I cannot tell him anything,
but he'll surely listen to you"

1074
01:58:40,059 --> 01:58:43,051
"He holds you in high esteem,
he can't refuse you"

1075
01:58:43,463 --> 01:58:45,454
"Please Didi, tell her"

1076
01:58:45,665 --> 01:58:49,658
"Only you can stop him, Paro.
Only you can stop him from drinking"

1077
01:58:50,003 --> 01:58:54,269
"Dharamdas, get a hold on yourself.
- You'll see him Won't you?"

1078
01:59:00,513 --> 01:59:04,609
"Paro, do you Want me to malign you,
to give you a bad name?"

1079
01:59:05,051 --> 01:59:09,317
"Had We given ourselves a bad name,
We might've ended up together"

1080
01:59:13,893 --> 01:59:17,624
"You're happy, aren't you Paro?
- Oh it's a different World, Dev"

1081
01:59:18,631 --> 01:59:23,432
"Huge manor, vast estates,
important people, great debates"

1082
01:59:23,636 --> 01:59:29,040
Great debates!
You've matured Paro

1083
01:59:30,643 --> 01:59:35,637
"You even look like an aristocrat.
Huge red dot, large eyes..."

1084
01:59:36,349 --> 01:59:38,647
big dreams...

1085
01:59:39,185 --> 01:59:41,449
"huge manors,
vast estates..."

1086
01:59:41,654 --> 01:59:45,454
and groWn-up children

1087
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,994
"Those large eyes,
I can keep Watching"

1088
01:59:58,605 --> 02:00:01,938
But I can't bear to see
big teardrops in those eyes

1089
02:00:04,611 --> 02:00:08,308
Just as Well that you came by.
I got some things I Wish to return

1090
02:00:08,915 --> 02:00:12,976
"Who knoWs, I might never return"

1091
02:00:14,621 --> 02:00:16,612
Come...

1092
02:00:18,024 --> 02:00:20,015
come With me

1093
02:00:22,629 --> 02:00:24,620
Stand right here

1094
02:00:31,104 --> 02:00:32,628
Look...

1095
02:00:32,772 --> 02:00:35,639
at yourself. Remember?

1096
02:00:38,545 --> 02:00:40,445
Arre O'Deva

1097
02:00:44,517 --> 02:00:46,644
What happened Paro?

1098
02:00:46,953 --> 02:00:49,444
"Deva, I lost my anklets.
Have you seen them?"

1099
02:00:50,657 --> 02:00:53,148
"No Paro, not l"

1100
02:00:54,594 --> 02:00:56,494
I stole them

1101
02:00:56,663 --> 02:01:00,099
And you kneW I did it
and Why I did it

1102
02:01:03,603 --> 02:01:05,195
"All day, the chime of your anklets,
and-Deva-this-and-Deva-that..."

1103
02:01:05,405 --> 02:01:07,600
And your pot

1104
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:10,942
"And here, the memento
of our love, our parting"

1105
02:01:11,678 --> 02:01:14,613
"You just left, that Was the end
of the relationship"

1106
02:01:15,148 --> 02:01:17,616
"But I'm still tied
to all these, Paro"

1107
02:01:18,618 --> 02:01:20,609
And I am tied
to memories of you

1108
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:23,618
What's that?
- A feW coins

1109
02:01:23,690 --> 02:01:26,625
Three Rupees.
- All they're Worth are memories

1110
02:01:27,226 --> 02:01:29,888
"Mine, aren't they? You thief"

1111
02:01:32,632 --> 02:01:36,193
"I'll take them back,
but only With usury"

1112
02:01:37,637 --> 02:01:40,970
HoW much interest Will you take?
- TWo percent

1113
02:01:42,642 --> 02:01:45,338
At tWo percent...

1114
02:01:46,045 --> 02:01:48,104
six cents a month

1115
02:01:48,348 --> 02:01:50,339
72 cents a year

1116
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:53,041
For 13 years...

1117
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,911
"13 years, Paro"

1118
02:01:56,589 --> 02:01:58,580
9.36

1119
02:01:59,926 --> 02:02:05,091
"You've become good at arithmetic.
- Circumstance taught me, Paro"

1120
02:02:05,932 --> 02:02:07,923
Let's talk of something else

1121
02:02:09,836 --> 02:02:15,331
"Paro, Why not turn matchmaker
and find a bride for Devdas?"

1122
02:02:15,708 --> 02:02:23,274
"I hear Manikpur girls are nice?
- Yes, but you Want a beauty, no?"

1123
02:02:23,516 --> 02:02:26,781
"No, not a beauty.
Just someone like you"

1124
02:02:29,422 --> 02:02:32,949
"Someone Who is pleasant?
- No, must be a bit naughty"

1125
02:02:33,059 --> 02:02:37,155
"Should be able to quarrel With me.
Like I said, she should be like you"

1126
02:02:37,864 --> 02:02:40,856
You can find them by the thousands.
- Spare me the thousands

1127
02:02:41,134 --> 02:02:43,625
"Just let me come to grips With
only one, of the likes you. Enough"

1128
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:51,642
Give up drinking.
- No

1129
02:02:51,911 --> 02:02:53,242
Try.
- No

1130
02:02:53,379 --> 02:02:56,576
You can give it up. Promise me
that you'll never drink again

1131
02:02:56,849 --> 02:02:59,579
Can you promise
you'll forget me?

1132
02:03:03,589 --> 02:03:05,580
"It's rather late, Paro"

1133
02:03:08,761 --> 02:03:10,991
I'm not leaving
until I have your Word

1134
02:03:11,164 --> 02:03:12,597
I can't.
- You can

1135
02:03:12,765 --> 02:03:17,327
One can do anything one Wants.
- Can you elope With me tonight?

1136
02:03:17,603 --> 02:03:19,833
What are you saying?
- Can you elope With me?

1137
02:03:19,939 --> 02:03:22,737
You've no one to look after you.
- Can you elope With me?

1138
02:03:22,942 --> 02:03:27,402
"I had only one dream. To serve you.
- If there's love, there's no fear"

1139
02:03:27,613 --> 02:03:31,413
One chance to fulfill my dream?
- Can you elope With me? Can you?

1140
02:03:31,617 --> 02:03:34,415
"Come With me. I'll care for you.
- Can you elope With me, Paro?"

1141
02:03:34,554 --> 02:03:37,614
"I can't bear to see you like this!
I feel like dying, Dev"

1142
02:03:38,825 --> 02:03:41,157
I feel like dying

1143
02:03:42,628 --> 02:03:49,192
"If serving me makes you happy,
then so be it"

1144
02:03:51,637 --> 02:03:57,576
"I promise you, before I die
I'll surely come to your doorstep"

1145
02:04:01,481 --> 02:04:04,177
"SWear that, by me"

1146
02:04:27,974 --> 02:04:29,771
Heartless

1147
02:04:37,817 --> 02:04:41,378
Your mother is squandering money.
Given so charitable a disposition...

1148
02:04:41,521 --> 02:04:45,958
"soon the coffers Will be empty.
- Absolutely right, Kumud"

1149
02:04:46,626 --> 02:04:52,622
But hoW can I stop Ma?
- You're such a complete fool

1150
02:04:53,866 --> 02:05:00,101
You can't. But I can stop her.
- You Will stop her? But hoW?

1151
02:05:02,642 --> 02:05:06,578
The keys to the vault? With you?
Ma has been looking for them

1152
02:05:10,983 --> 02:05:15,784
I've hidden the keys.
You Will say that the keys are lost

1153
02:05:15,955 --> 02:05:19,152
What?
- The vault keys are lost

1154
02:05:20,593 --> 02:05:24,393
And the vault has been robbed

1155
02:05:29,602 --> 02:05:31,399
The key...

1156
02:05:31,604 --> 02:05:33,265
to the money

1157
02:05:35,608 --> 02:05:38,600
Brother-in-laW! You?
So early? In the offices?

1158
02:05:39,178 --> 02:05:43,342
And alcohol? Without as much
as a care for the family prestige?

1159
02:05:43,749 --> 02:05:46,946
What Will people say?
What Will your mother think?

1160
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:50,418
You didn't consider that
When you Were stealing the keys?

1161
02:05:50,690 --> 02:05:55,354
What Will people say?
What Will your Chhoto-Ma think?

1162
02:05:55,561 --> 02:05:59,088
The Wealth of our forefathers
may not be squandered over alcohol

1163
02:06:00,266 --> 02:06:04,259
The keys left by our forefathers
may not be stolen like this

1164
02:06:04,604 --> 02:06:08,438
I'm making this clear.
Under no circumstance...

1165
02:06:08,574 --> 02:06:12,738
am I parting With the keys.
- You Will turn in the keys

1166
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:16,915
Today and noW

1167
02:06:19,318 --> 02:06:20,979
Right here

1168
02:06:22,588 --> 02:06:24,488
To my mother

1169
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:29,457
Do not think I am so Weak. I too
hail from a family of landlords

1170
02:06:29,795 --> 02:06:32,389
I have seen money by the chestfuls
in my father's house

1171
02:06:33,866 --> 02:06:36,858
Have you seen the streak of madness
that runs in the family?

1172
02:06:45,745 --> 02:06:48,407
"What are you upto, Dev?
- Brother you surely agree that..."

1173
02:06:48,614 --> 02:06:55,417
I have as much right as you to the
Wealth that our forefathers left us

1174
02:06:55,855 --> 02:06:58,346
Yes. Why are you
pouring alcohol?

1175
02:07:03,629 --> 02:07:09,499
I'm putting on fire my share.
Save your share if you can

1176
02:07:11,637 --> 02:07:16,631
I'll give you anything you Want!
- As of noW...

1177
02:07:17,543 --> 02:07:20,444
only the keys.
- Which you Will never have

1178
02:07:26,919 --> 02:07:29,717
"Kumud! Give him the keys.
Else, he'll burn doWn the office"

1179
02:07:29,922 --> 02:07:33,380
Let him do Whatever he Wants.
I'm not scared of empty threats

1180
02:07:40,666 --> 02:07:43,567
He's actually burning the place doWn!
Call Chhoto-Ma

1181
02:07:43,703 --> 02:07:45,796
"Give him the keys, Kumud.
- No"

1182
02:07:45,938 --> 02:07:47,929
He's crazy!
Are you out of your mind too?

1183
02:07:48,007 --> 02:07:49,736
No!
- Give him the keys

1184
02:07:50,176 --> 02:07:52,167
What's up Kumud?

1185
02:07:52,845 --> 02:07:55,609
What's happening in this house?

1186
02:08:02,621 --> 02:08:05,954
"You Were looking for the keys
to the vault, Weren't you?"

1187
02:08:06,425 --> 02:08:10,623
I caught him With the keys
and he threatened me

1188
02:08:11,030 --> 02:08:15,296
He Won't part With the keys
and he Wants his share

1189
02:08:15,634 --> 02:08:21,630
"Else, he'll burn the house doWn.
I pleaded With him..."

1190
02:08:24,643 --> 02:08:27,441
You Want your share?

1191
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:33,641
That is your only share

1192
02:08:36,088 --> 02:08:38,318
No one in this house
ever understood you

1193
02:08:38,758 --> 02:08:41,454
All of us are responsible
for your ruination

1194
02:08:41,861 --> 02:08:46,992
"Before We lead you
to Worse, leave this house"

1195
02:08:47,666 --> 02:08:51,466
"Babu-ji said leave the village.
Everyone said, leave Paro"

1196
02:08:51,737 --> 02:08:56,401
"Paro said, leave drinking.
NoW you say, leave this house"

1197
02:08:56,709 --> 02:08:59,041
"One day, He Will say..."

1198
02:09:00,012 --> 02:09:02,606
leave this World

1199
02:09:04,350 --> 02:09:07,615
Hereby I rescind all my rights
to everything in this house

1200
02:09:11,624 --> 02:09:16,425
But I am part of you. That right
no one takes aWay from me

1201
02:09:17,096 --> 02:09:19,087
Not even you

1202
02:10:15,521 --> 02:10:17,819
"It's no easy undertaking,
it's an ancient ritual"

1203
02:10:18,190 --> 02:10:24,186
"For the ritual, one must fetch
the soil from a courtesan's doorstep"

1204
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:27,958
"In that soil, is built
the image of the goddess"

1205
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:29,858
I knoW

1206
02:10:30,035 --> 02:10:34,438
And go Where men daren't even Walk
in daytimes for fear of censure?

1207
02:10:34,773 --> 02:10:40,177
Don't humans live there?
Is there no air?

1208
02:10:40,546 --> 02:10:45,984
No sun in those quarters?
Do rains refuse to visit them?

1209
02:10:46,652 --> 02:10:49,450
Nature doesn't discriminate.
Should We?

1210
02:10:49,788 --> 02:10:54,589
Parvati is right.
Even Subhadra Wanted it done

1211
02:10:55,294 --> 02:10:57,990
"Very Well,
as our Parvati Wishes"

1212
02:10:58,597 --> 02:11:03,000
"But remember, it's the Durga Puja.
- Rest assured"

1213
02:11:03,869 --> 02:11:07,999
I'll tell Mahendra
to facilitate your journey

1214
02:11:10,276 --> 02:11:13,143
Devdas lives in a brothel?

1215
02:11:16,615 --> 02:11:20,073
"A lady is here, Wants to see you.
She's also asking about Dev Babu"

1216
02:11:21,620 --> 02:11:23,918
Must be Paro

1217
02:11:30,629 --> 02:11:31,891
Paro?

1218
02:11:32,531 --> 02:11:37,628
HoW did you knoW I'm Parvati?
- Dev Babu told me...

1219
02:11:38,070 --> 02:11:43,633
"should a Woman come asking for him,
she can only be Paro"

1220
02:11:44,243 --> 02:11:46,643
What are you doing?

1221
02:11:47,213 --> 02:11:52,446
"My obeisances to the Woman, Whom
I shall never be able to replace"

1222
02:11:52,818 --> 02:12:00,224
"I have heard of exotic Women here,
but you possess the Wile too"

1223
02:12:00,759 --> 02:12:04,490
"Only if you'd see,
I have a heart too"

1224
02:12:04,697 --> 02:12:07,962
Chandramukhi...
isn't that your name?

1225
02:12:10,603 --> 02:12:13,003
They also call me Devdasi

1226
02:12:15,741 --> 02:12:20,610
You are famous.
- Not anymore

1227
02:12:21,013 --> 02:12:22,605
Why?

1228
02:12:23,015 --> 02:12:28,612
"At angel's touch, I learnt
of a sacrifice I never kneW"

1229
02:12:30,623 --> 02:12:35,083
HoW strange of a courtesan
to sWear by fidelity

1230
02:12:35,928 --> 02:12:38,419
Curious too...

1231
02:12:39,298 --> 02:12:42,631
What draWs an aristocrat
to a courtesan's doorstep?

1232
02:12:44,436 --> 02:12:46,427
Where is Dev?

1233
02:12:46,939 --> 02:12:52,036
I too am eager to hear his footfall
Six months it has been...

1234
02:12:52,645 --> 02:12:56,809
since I set my eyes on him.
- You lie

1235
02:12:58,584 --> 02:13:03,248
"If you don't trust, look around.
- Or do you assume I Won't?"

1236
02:13:03,989 --> 02:13:06,583
HoW long do you think
you can keep Dev here?

1237
02:13:06,992 --> 02:13:10,985
"Only so long as the beauty,
the youth, the money?"

1238
02:13:11,930 --> 02:13:17,266
What's your endgame?
You must have fleeced Dev

1239
02:13:17,670 --> 02:13:22,937
I'll pay you more. I can't bear
to see Dev suffering this hell

1240
02:13:26,745 --> 02:13:28,610
HoW strange

1241
02:13:30,082 --> 02:13:36,021
"The very Paro Who drove Dev Babu
to insanity, Wants to buy him"

1242
02:13:39,692 --> 02:13:43,628
And What may you have to offer me?
Can you offer social recognition?

1243
02:13:44,630 --> 02:13:47,292
Can you possibly
make him love me?

1244
02:13:47,633 --> 02:13:50,329
"Or make it possible
that I may touch him, just once?"

1245
02:13:50,736 --> 02:13:56,368
"Dreams, longing, hopes,
that he has kindled in my heart..."

1246
02:13:56,742 --> 02:14:00,576
might you make them come true?
Can you?

1247
02:14:01,980 --> 02:14:04,574
"No, you cannot deliver"

1248
02:14:06,652 --> 02:14:11,589
And I Will not give you Dev Babu.
- And I Will take him aWay

1249
02:14:12,591 --> 02:14:19,292
"And no one is stopping me. Not you,
not social sanction, not even Dev"

1250
02:14:20,699 --> 02:14:25,602
"Not to forget, courtesans
aren't destined to have husbands"

1251
02:14:28,707 --> 02:14:31,608
"Courtesans have no destiny, lady"

1252
02:14:48,527 --> 02:14:54,557
"From your perspective,
you can see nothing. From mine..."

1253
02:14:55,701 --> 02:14:58,295
you Will find him everywhere

1254
02:14:59,905 --> 02:15:03,568
"Look, there he is,
in the flame of the lamp"

1255
02:15:04,576 --> 02:15:06,976
"There he lies,
in folds of the covers"

1256
02:15:07,446 --> 02:15:09,380
In that half a chalice...

1257
02:15:09,581 --> 02:15:14,575
"his thirst lies, unquenched.
His fragrance still lingers"

1258
02:15:15,654 --> 02:15:22,321
"Take it all, if you can. The light,
the folds, the fragrance, all of it"

1259
02:15:32,938 --> 02:15:34,735
All yours

1260
02:15:35,774 --> 02:15:40,211
But I cannot give you your Devdas.
- You love Dev so dearly?

1261
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:44,112
I only Worship him

1262
02:15:45,617 --> 02:15:49,018
NoW I'm assured.
Dev isn't Ionely anymore

1263
02:15:51,623 --> 02:15:57,289
Oh I forgot What I came here for.
I Want to perform the Durga Puja

1264
02:15:57,963 --> 02:16:00,193
"From your doorstep,
I Want soil"

1265
02:16:00,566 --> 02:16:02,557
May I?

1266
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:19,583
What is this?
- I came for Dev. Instead...

1267
02:16:19,818 --> 02:16:22,582
it's something
I entrust you With

1268
02:16:23,922 --> 02:16:27,915
I Will expect you for
the Durga Puja. Do come

1269
02:16:54,953 --> 02:16:56,944
Chandramukhi...

1270
02:16:59,758 --> 02:17:01,749
I'm so happy
to have you here

1271
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:03,951
I'm glad

1272
02:17:04,229 --> 02:17:08,165
HoW could I refuse your invitation?
I had to come

1273
02:17:08,634 --> 02:17:11,228
Have you met Dev?

1274
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:16,631
Who is this?

1275
02:17:17,242 --> 02:17:21,372
"Chandramukhi, my friend.
She comes from Calcutta"

1276
02:17:22,281 --> 02:17:27,981
"Bless you, consider this your home.
Parvati, don't let her go too soon"

1277
02:17:28,453 --> 02:17:32,184
Sure. You Will leave only after
the celebrations

1278
02:17:32,658 --> 02:17:35,456
No Paro! I can't stay here

1279
02:17:35,661 --> 02:17:39,859
Why not? It's been ages since I had
a heart-to-heart chat With someone

1280
02:17:40,265 --> 02:17:44,065
"Come, let celebrations be the ruse
for forgetting our Woes"

1281
02:17:44,536 --> 02:17:47,664
"Let's sing, dance,
give ourselves a little to live"

1282
02:17:47,839 --> 02:17:51,070
No...
- Our joys might touch Dev

1283
02:17:51,843 --> 02:17:55,609
"Paro, listen to me.
- No refusing. For Dev's sake"

1284
02:17:56,915 --> 02:17:59,611
"Come Kali Babu, the chess game
isn't over yet"

1285
02:18:00,619 --> 02:18:03,417
The real chessgame
is being played here

1286
02:18:03,655 --> 02:18:07,614
Devdas' Chandramukhi comes.
To meet Devdas' Paro

1287
02:18:07,826 --> 02:18:10,090
Who's Paro?
- Mother-in-laW

1288
02:18:11,029 --> 02:18:14,965
Parvati. One move and
I've checkmated all four

1289
02:18:15,901 --> 02:18:17,630
Paro

1290
02:18:17,769 --> 02:18:19,430
Chandramukhi

1291
02:18:19,638 --> 02:18:21,629
Bhuvan Chaudhary

1292
02:18:21,873 --> 02:18:23,636
Devdas

1293
02:18:25,811 --> 02:18:28,041
"Deva, the day is daWning"

1294
02:18:30,716 --> 02:18:33,651
"But forever, this heart
Will live in darkness"

1295
02:18:34,653 --> 02:18:37,144
Shall We go noW?
- To Whom?

1296
02:18:37,756 --> 02:18:40,919
"One by one, all my
relationships are over"

1297
02:18:41,793 --> 02:18:46,059
"BetWeen my father and I
there Was no love lost, right?"

1298
02:18:48,367 --> 02:18:51,666
I Was his tempest
and he Was my Whip

1299
02:19:03,615 --> 02:19:07,608
"Even my brother figured first
in mother's lullaby, right?"

1300
02:19:09,054 --> 02:19:16,620
"My brother and I never hit it off.
He's practical, I'm impractical"

1301
02:19:18,697 --> 02:19:22,428
One inculcates a humorous
relationship With a brother's Wife

1302
02:19:23,435 --> 02:19:26,962
"I Was the one Who ended up
being the butt of the joke, right?"

1303
02:19:29,808 --> 02:19:35,212
And there Was Paro
and I love her...

1304
02:19:35,814 --> 02:19:37,441
you knoW...

1305
02:19:37,649 --> 02:19:39,378
so much

1306
02:19:42,821 --> 02:19:45,381
"So much, right?"

1307
02:19:56,001 --> 02:19:58,595
NoW she is estranged too

1308
02:20:05,610 --> 02:20:09,341
But there's one...

1309
02:20:10,315 --> 02:20:13,307
one Chandramukhi.
Loves me dearly

1310
02:20:13,518 --> 02:20:15,213
But...

1311
02:20:19,091 --> 02:20:20,820
priest?

1312
02:20:23,195 --> 02:20:24,958
Priest...

1313
02:20:33,972 --> 02:20:36,532
Are you familiar With the last rites?
- Of course

1314
02:20:36,708 --> 02:20:39,973
Will you perform the ritual?
- Of course. Who is the deceased?

1315
02:20:40,245 --> 02:20:42,645
Devdas Mukherjee
- Are you insane?

1316
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:45,878
You'll perform your last rites?
- Give me my last rites

1317
02:20:46,051 --> 02:20:47,916
"Priest, go aWay"

1318
02:21:01,099 --> 02:21:03,932
Deva! What madness is this?

1319
02:21:04,603 --> 02:21:05,592
Come back

1320
02:21:06,605 --> 02:21:10,200
Unto the departed Soul...

1321
02:21:10,609 --> 02:21:13,601
"grant salvation, Lord"

1322
02:21:14,646 --> 02:21:17,114
"Come back, I beg of you"

1323
02:22:57,048 --> 02:23:00,313
The throb...

1324
02:23:00,585 --> 02:23:04,248
sWays my heart

1325
02:23:19,204 --> 02:23:22,332
"I dare that evil eye
or let thunder strike"

1326
02:23:22,674 --> 02:23:25,609
I'll Wear my dancing bells

1327
02:23:26,011 --> 02:23:29,742
In my anklets...

1328
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:33,347
"I Will give in
to the ecstasy..."

1329
02:23:33,618 --> 02:23:37,179
of the throb...

1330
02:23:37,522 --> 02:23:41,014
"that sWays
my heart, my soul"

1331
02:23:59,344 --> 02:24:02,905
What chimes?

1332
02:24:03,481 --> 02:24:06,382
What's that love in eyes?

1333
02:24:06,651 --> 02:24:10,178
Why the crescendo?

1334
02:24:10,588 --> 02:24:13,921
Is it longing?

1335
02:24:17,729 --> 02:24:20,596
He's in the red dot I Wear

1336
02:24:21,099 --> 02:24:23,932
He's in the dream in my eyes

1337
02:24:24,703 --> 02:24:27,604
You're obsessed

1338
02:24:28,606 --> 02:24:31,404
Your heart beats for him

1339
02:24:31,977 --> 02:24:35,970
I remember him in the chime

1340
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:43,016
I remember him in the tinkle

1341
02:25:49,421 --> 02:25:55,223
You've given me a World...

1342
02:25:56,561 --> 02:26:02,966
of your oWn happinesses

1343
02:26:03,668 --> 02:26:08,128
Never desert him

1344
02:26:10,942 --> 02:26:15,379
Marry him

1345
02:26:18,583 --> 02:26:23,577
To him you are priceless

1346
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:30,992
I am Worthless

1347
02:27:48,473 --> 02:27:50,134
Wonderful

1348
02:27:50,808 --> 02:27:53,140
What a display of true colour

1349
02:27:53,878 --> 02:27:59,339
An aristocrat and a courtesan
come together

1350
02:28:01,119 --> 02:28:03,952
"What are you saying?
- That Which you see, Badi-Ma"

1351
02:28:04,289 --> 02:28:06,280
And What everyone is Watching

1352
02:28:06,624 --> 02:28:10,617
"This Woman, Whom Mother-in-laW
calls a friend, is a Whore"

1353
02:28:10,962 --> 02:28:12,953
Yes Mother-in-laW?

1354
02:28:14,966 --> 02:28:17,298
What am I hearing Parvati?

1355
02:28:18,069 --> 02:28:21,630
Why are you silent? AnsWer.
- She is embarrassed

1356
02:28:22,073 --> 02:28:26,635
Landlords did keep Whores

1357
02:28:27,245 --> 02:28:31,443
NoW even a lady of the manor makes
friendships in brothels. Wonderment

1358
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:39,447
That's stripping Without touching.
You started the farce. I ended it

1359
02:28:39,757 --> 02:28:44,660
"No Kali Babu, if men could
enact farce, What need for Whores?"

1360
02:28:45,129 --> 02:28:47,359
You Would've had
your brothel too

1361
02:28:48,266 --> 02:28:50,666
You knoW it
and it's commonplace

1362
02:28:51,135 --> 02:28:54,400
It is the aristocrat
Who brings cheer to the brothels

1363
02:28:54,939 --> 02:28:58,397
And bastards are born
of aristocrats of your ilk

1364
02:28:58,943 --> 02:29:03,277
"Call them illegitimate if you Will,
but aristocracy runs in their veins"

1365
02:29:03,615 --> 02:29:06,516
Company of the aristocracy doesn't
confer status to the courtesan

1366
02:29:06,651 --> 02:29:11,611
"Absolutely correct, Badi-Ma. But Why
should the lady be embarrassed?"

1367
02:29:12,023 --> 02:29:17,427
"If she spoke a feW kind Words to me,
it's because she considers me human"

1368
02:29:18,630 --> 02:29:23,624
He Who frequents the alleyways
of disrepute ought to be ashamed

1369
02:29:24,535 --> 02:29:27,971
The very dens littered With trophies
of the lust of his forefathers

1370
02:29:28,873 --> 02:29:34,334
Have you thought? You might have
a sister someWhere in the brothels

1371
02:29:35,179 --> 02:29:37,647
Why sister? You might even
visit your daughter's...

1372
02:29:41,152 --> 02:29:43,643
In the soil
at the courtesan's doorstep...

1373
02:29:43,788 --> 02:29:48,248
is moulded the image of the goddess.
The soil isn't impotent

1374
02:29:50,662 --> 02:29:53,062
NoW the farce ends

1375
02:29:59,103 --> 02:30:01,333
"I return, lady..."

1376
02:30:01,773 --> 02:30:08,611
"back to my World,
to those disreputable alleys..."

1377
02:30:09,614 --> 02:30:12,606
Where I might someday find
Dev Babu again

1378
02:30:15,620 --> 02:30:17,417
FareWell

1379
02:30:29,434 --> 02:30:31,925
"Before leaving,
I Wish to apologise"

1380
02:30:32,503 --> 02:30:36,530
Talking in public
about Chandramukhi Was a mistake

1381
02:30:37,608 --> 02:30:42,773
I didn't make the other mistake.
I told your husband and Badi Ma...

1382
02:30:43,147 --> 02:30:46,378
about your friendship
With Devdas

1383
02:30:48,086 --> 02:30:52,386
You liked tWisting my ear? I Would
cut your nose to spite your face

1384
02:30:53,391 --> 02:30:54,380
Goodbye

1385
02:30:58,796 --> 02:31:01,060
"Not at Parvati,
fingers Will be raised at us"

1386
02:31:01,432 --> 02:31:05,994
The matter must end
here and noW

1387
02:31:06,404 --> 02:31:09,532
Did you ask for me?
- Yes Parvati

1388
02:31:11,008 --> 02:31:13,738
I Would like to knoW...
- Who Devdas is?

1389
02:31:14,412 --> 02:31:19,748
"Devdas is a childhood friend,
he Was body, I Was soul"

1390
02:31:21,119 --> 02:31:26,751
"He is my love and he is my vanity
and he is With me, alWays"

1391
02:31:27,325 --> 02:31:32,228
Do you realise What you are saying?
- Same as What you told me

1392
02:31:33,131 --> 02:31:37,227
"You're noW the lady of the manor,
the mother of my children. No doubt"

1393
02:31:37,602 --> 02:31:41,231
"But Subhadra, I can never forget.
- Subhadra Was my Wife"

1394
02:31:41,606 --> 02:31:45,098
Subhadra Was your first love.
Devdas is mine

1395
02:31:46,077 --> 02:31:50,707
"First love, like years
can never be obliterated"

1396
02:31:51,082 --> 02:31:54,574
"Parvati, you are forgetting.
You are the lady of the manor"

1397
02:31:54,952 --> 02:32:01,915
Maybe that's reason for my guilt?
I'll accept any penalty you decree

1398
02:32:02,393 --> 02:32:04,384
Of course you Will be punished

1399
02:32:05,396 --> 02:32:12,393
The very men Who paid obeisances
to this manor are enjoying a farce

1400
02:32:13,971 --> 02:32:20,206
You may never step out of the manor.
This is your punishment

1401
02:32:20,578 --> 02:32:24,571
"But What punishment, Parvati?
We are the ones being punished"

1402
02:32:26,017 --> 02:32:29,976
The lamps We lit in celebration
have set fire to our house

1403
02:32:31,122 --> 02:32:34,649
AIWays put out the fires
that threaten your home

1404
02:32:56,681 --> 02:33:00,879
"Fun, frolic and friends"

1405
02:33:02,386 --> 02:33:07,949
"Without you, life Was desolate.
With you, comes the cheer"

1406
02:33:09,994 --> 02:33:17,400
Why care for outcomes?
Let's raise cheer

1407
02:33:18,102 --> 02:33:19,399
Yes friend?

1408
02:33:29,981 --> 02:33:32,415
Let clink the glasses

1409
02:33:37,188 --> 02:33:42,421
"Let clink the glasses,
Whatever the outcome"

1410
02:34:04,382 --> 02:34:09,376
"Let clink the glasses,
Whatever the outcome"

1411
02:34:11,088 --> 02:34:16,390
"And hear the chhalak-chal
"in the sWirl"

1412
02:34:21,399 --> 02:34:26,735
"Music, When my cup floWeth over"

1413
02:34:30,841 --> 02:34:36,074
"And hear the dhamk-dhamk-dham
"inside your heart..."

1414
02:34:41,419 --> 02:34:44,115
When you clink the glasses

1415
02:35:15,386 --> 02:35:17,377
"This madeira"..."

1416
02:35:18,389 --> 02:35:22,951
"This madeira" shoWers
a rain of memories"

1417
02:35:23,394 --> 02:35:27,660
"In every spill, madeira
"cheats the heart"

1418
02:35:28,399 --> 02:35:31,391
"The madeira" coursing doWn
tells..."

1419
02:35:33,104 --> 02:35:37,200
tales of hearts

1420
02:35:38,175 --> 02:35:42,908
"Like lightning in hearts,
it strikes clouds of sorroW"

1421
02:35:43,314 --> 02:35:47,341
And When it reaches the heart...

1422
02:35:48,152 --> 02:35:51,952
it evokes...

1423
02:35:53,357 --> 02:35:56,588
memories of her

1424
02:35:57,395 --> 02:36:02,025
Oh for a glimpse...

1425
02:36:02,466 --> 02:36:07,096
Oh for a glimpse of her

1426
02:36:07,505 --> 02:36:09,769
That's...

1427
02:36:10,174 --> 02:36:14,042
What little I pray for

1428
02:36:15,079 --> 02:36:19,038
So little I pray for

1429
02:36:34,498 --> 02:36:37,058
"Mira dances for her
Ghanshyam..."

1430
02:36:37,401 --> 02:36:40,962
she dances in gay abandon

1431
02:36:54,118 --> 02:36:59,351
"Hear the jhanak-jhank-jhan
"in the chime of her anklets"

1432
02:37:04,662 --> 02:37:08,154
"I'm in love,
I don't care for censure"

1433
02:37:11,335 --> 02:37:12,859
And hoW...

1434
02:37:17,074 --> 02:37:21,704
"NoW hear the thirak-thirak"?
That's my heart dancing aWay"

1435
02:38:50,401 --> 02:38:53,564
Even a drop of alcohol
is poison for him

1436
02:38:56,106 --> 02:38:58,199
Any moment may be treacherous

1437
02:38:59,410 --> 02:39:02,072
Try to keep him in good cheer

1438
02:39:03,314 --> 02:39:04,406
Oh God!

1439
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:14,414
What is this Dharamdas?
Cry and you Will make me cry too

1440
02:39:15,326 --> 02:39:19,126
And people Will call me a courtesan
Who cannot enact a farce

1441
02:39:20,197 --> 02:39:23,098
"We got to keep Dev Babu
in good cheer, no?"

1442
02:39:23,434 --> 02:39:28,098
You're absolutely right.
Let's Wipe our tears

1443
02:39:28,439 --> 02:39:33,433
Let our laughter
ring in Dev's ears

1444
02:39:34,378 --> 02:39:38,940
Yes Dharamdas.
- Let's fill his life With joys

1445
02:39:41,218 --> 02:39:47,384
Yes Dharamdas.
- All his Woes be gone

1446
02:39:48,158 --> 02:39:52,492
"Yes Dharamdas, yes"

1447
02:39:54,298 --> 02:39:57,597
Game over. I Win again

1448
02:40:00,404 --> 02:40:04,898
No point playing With you!
You've robbed us blind

1449
02:40:05,209 --> 02:40:08,645
A feW more games With you and
you'll make me sell this brothel

1450
02:40:09,413 --> 02:40:12,143
Stop giggling and get lost

1451
02:40:13,117 --> 02:40:15,142
Time for your medicine.
I'll send it over

1452
02:40:15,486 --> 02:40:21,015
"In a chalice. Else, it Won't Work.
- Even contemplating it is lethal"

1453
02:40:23,127 --> 02:40:24,754
Met Paro?

1454
02:40:28,198 --> 02:40:32,225
HoW did you find my Paro?
- If love be personified...

1455
02:40:32,569 --> 02:40:36,198
"Paro's Would be the being,
hers the very heart"

1456
02:40:37,441 --> 02:40:43,437
"Forbidden though it is, I alWays
end up With a metaphor about eyes"

1457
02:40:44,315 --> 02:40:47,876
"One Paro
and one, Chandramukhi"

1458
02:40:49,086 --> 02:40:51,077
"One, sentimental, vivacious"

1459
02:40:52,056 --> 02:40:54,889
"And you...
hoW delicate, hoW demure"

1460
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:59,129
"She is fickle, like a doe,
gushing like a river..."

1461
02:40:59,463 --> 02:41:04,765
"the liar, the butterfly, the Moon
and you?"

1462
02:41:05,102 --> 02:41:09,402
"Poem? Ballad?
Some tears, sometimes fire"

1463
02:41:11,408 --> 02:41:17,108
"Everyone loves her.
- And you, unloved by all save me?"

1464
02:41:51,181 --> 02:41:55,709
"What is this, Chandramukhi?
I Was likening you to fortitude"

1465
02:41:56,387 --> 02:42:01,950
"What you turn out to be? Wax doll?
Look at you, melting aWay"

1466
02:42:04,395 --> 02:42:08,388
Will you let the candle melt aWay
and cast me in dark?

1467
02:42:17,408 --> 02:42:23,404
"You've done much for me,
Chandramukhi. One more favour"

1468
02:42:26,216 --> 02:42:30,983
Let me leave.
- No! You knoW not What you suffer

1469
02:42:31,321 --> 02:42:36,520
You knoW it and I suffer.
- Then Why must you?

1470
02:42:38,328 --> 02:42:41,889
I must face myself
before I'm lost

1471
02:42:44,101 --> 02:42:45,932
May a servant folloW you?

1472
02:42:50,274 --> 02:42:54,506
I cannot bear to see my death
mirrored in your eyes

1473
02:43:18,268 --> 02:43:20,259
I have been given heaven and earth

1474
02:43:22,873 --> 02:43:24,864
Will We meet again?

1475
02:43:43,360 --> 02:43:51,529
What the Judge of virtue and vice
Will pronounce for you I knoW not

1476
02:43:53,370 --> 02:44:01,709
"But in the afterlife, should We meet
I Won't be able to renounce you"

1477
02:44:12,456 --> 02:44:18,588
"As far as the train travels.
Bombay, Delhi, Lahore, Assam"

1478
02:44:20,297 --> 02:44:23,164
"I Want to see all of India,
are you coming With me?"

1479
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:28,594
"I'll take you around the World,
if you keep up this cheer"

1480
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:34,540
"I'm cheerful, am I not?
My final journey has begun"

1481
02:44:48,058 --> 02:44:50,891
"Deva, What is the matter With you?
- What's the matter?"

1482
02:44:51,795 --> 02:44:53,558
Are you all right?

1483
02:44:55,732 --> 02:45:00,795
HoW come you haven't left?
- I'm not leaving you all alone

1484
02:45:01,471 --> 02:45:06,340
Are you afraid I'll drink again?
- Alcohol is poison for you

1485
02:45:06,710 --> 02:45:09,577
One drop...
- And I'm dead?

1486
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:14,579
"Yes! You Were delirious,
that's Why I didn't leave you"

1487
02:45:15,319 --> 02:45:20,985
And enough of this journey. You've
had your say and I've had enough

1488
02:45:21,325 --> 02:45:24,852
"At the next station, We change the
train and We go to see your mother"

1489
02:45:25,329 --> 02:45:30,028
"At the next station,
you go back to your compartment"

1490
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:34,097
Why are you so stubborn?
- Put out the lights

1491
02:45:34,438 --> 02:45:40,070
"And tomorroW, I'm taking you
to a doctor. AIWays fickle"

1492
02:45:42,212 --> 02:45:45,943
"Passengers to Sonarpur, Garia,
Phoolbagan to detrain"

1493
02:45:54,992 --> 02:45:57,552
"Dharamdas, you're back?"

1494
02:46:06,236 --> 02:46:08,830
Friend! HoW are you?

1495
02:46:09,273 --> 02:46:14,802
"Small World it is, that's Why
We keep bumping into each other"

1496
02:46:15,479 --> 02:46:23,318
So Where and hoW have you been?
- Right here and I'm fine

1497
02:46:25,589 --> 02:46:32,085
"Tell me hoW you have been.
- What With me, I'm soaring"

1498
02:46:32,529 --> 02:46:38,525
"But you look... pale.
What gives, friend?"

1499
02:46:39,536 --> 02:46:45,941
For a moment I Was in a quandary.
Is this my star of Chitpore?

1500
02:46:46,343 --> 02:46:49,540
"No, I'm all the same.
- Even if you aren't, here I am"

1501
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:54,544
"Let's raise cheer.
It's been long, let's have a party"

1502
02:46:56,420 --> 02:46:59,082
So What if We aren't in a brothel?
Even train compartments Will do

1503
02:46:59,556 --> 02:47:02,923
"If not the dancing bells,
let's cheer the rhythm of the rails"

1504
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:06,787
"If not Chandramukhi,
let it be betWeen her paramours"

1505
02:47:12,269 --> 02:47:13,759
Here you are

1506
02:47:16,573 --> 02:47:21,567
"No Chuni Babu, I don't drink.
- Someone has extracted a promise?"

1507
02:47:23,580 --> 02:47:27,812
"No.
- Then do it, for friendship's sake"

1508
02:47:28,285 --> 02:47:31,914
After ages! Let's live it up.
Why not?

1509
02:47:32,289 --> 02:47:35,122
"In a tomorroW, may We be?
Might not"

1510
02:47:36,226 --> 02:47:40,185
"You'll be. As for me,
you never knoW"

1511
02:47:54,044 --> 02:48:00,313
"My share of life I've lived,
noW I'm counting on my heart"

1512
02:48:02,252 --> 02:48:07,656
"What With the World, it Will even
grudge you your last breath"

1513
02:48:09,326 --> 02:48:13,695
Encore! HoW sWeet!
That's poetry

1514
02:48:14,097 --> 02:48:17,897
"Shards of the heart,
they call poetry. I don't care"

1515
02:48:18,201 --> 02:48:23,571
What hurts is When they Want...
- Encores? Wonderful

1516
02:48:24,007 --> 02:48:27,568
"Encore, encore"

1517
02:48:34,251 --> 02:48:36,583
Hey Dev Babu...

1518
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:38,911
What's happening?

1519
02:48:39,256 --> 02:48:41,588
What's ailing you?
Have you taken a cure?

1520
02:48:46,329 --> 02:48:48,388
"I'm incurable, Chuni Babu"

1521
02:48:55,205 --> 02:48:59,869
"Then Why did you drink, knoWing?
- For friendship's sake, Chuni Babu"

1522
02:49:00,277 --> 02:49:06,182
"Friendship? You take me for
a stranger? Not again, not again..."

1523
02:49:06,616 --> 02:49:10,848
"No stranger, Chuni Babu.
You're the closest to me"

1524
02:49:12,522 --> 02:49:18,188
I've even imbibed your metaphor.
The Sunrise of life...

1525
02:49:18,628 --> 02:49:22,792
the salutations...
then the solace...

1526
02:49:24,267 --> 02:49:27,634
"and in seconds, time takes
such a turn Chuni Babu..."

1527
02:49:28,638 --> 02:49:33,075
all ties With life are severed.
- No Dev Babu

1528
02:49:33,577 --> 02:49:35,044
The Sun...

1529
02:49:35,378 --> 02:49:39,246
"the song, the serenade,
sympathy betWeen friends"

1530
02:49:39,583 --> 02:49:45,579
"But separation... no...
- It all ends, Chuni Babu"

1531
02:49:45,922 --> 02:49:46,911
No

1532
02:49:52,362 --> 02:49:56,389
Silence? So deathly?
As if I'm dead already?

1533
02:49:59,102 --> 02:50:01,093
I sWear by our friendship...

1534
02:50:02,272 --> 02:50:04,604
this silence...

1535
02:50:05,609 --> 02:50:07,839
is stifling

1536
02:50:09,613 --> 02:50:13,276
"And you knoW Chuni Babu,
miles to go..."

1537
02:50:13,617 --> 02:50:15,608
before my thirst is quenched

1538
02:50:21,625 --> 02:50:23,616
Oh When Will my thirst
be quenched?

1539
02:51:00,096 --> 02:51:01,825
What happened to Chhoti-Ma?

1540
02:51:02,299 --> 02:51:03,357
Blood?

1541
02:51:25,622 --> 02:51:30,616
"Pandua. Passengers to Manikpur,
Mirzapur, Mirgaon, detrain"

1542
02:51:35,665 --> 02:51:39,567
If serving me makes you happy...

1543
02:51:40,570 --> 02:51:45,803
"I promise you, before I die
I Will surely come to your doorstep"

1544
02:51:46,309 --> 02:51:49,005
"SWear that, by me"

1545
02:52:22,612 --> 02:52:23,601
Are We there?

1546
02:52:23,747 --> 02:52:27,615
The journey has just begun.
What's Wrong With you?

1547
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:35,216
"Devdas... come to me, my darling"

1548
02:52:45,735 --> 02:52:48,602
All day tramping around the village
With that Paro

1549
02:52:48,938 --> 02:52:51,236
Not another moment
for you in this house

1550
02:52:54,577 --> 02:53:00,573
Deva! I'm not letting you leave!
- Dharamdas! Don't let him go

1551
02:53:02,252 --> 02:53:03,583
Stop Dev

1552
02:53:17,767 --> 02:53:20,793
"Faster, please"

1553
02:53:22,305 --> 02:53:24,102
Very little time left

1554
02:53:24,307 --> 02:53:25,296
Yes sir

1555
02:53:33,249 --> 02:53:36,878
"Babu-ji said leave the village.
Everyone said, leave Paro"

1556
02:53:37,253 --> 02:53:41,781
"Paro said, leave drinking.
NoW you say, leave this house"

1557
02:53:42,325 --> 02:53:46,557
"One day, He Will say,
leave this World"

1558
02:53:52,569 --> 02:53:57,700
Here's Manikpur.
Brought you in before sun-up

1559
02:54:03,580 --> 02:54:06,105
Whom are you seeing in Manikpur?

1560
02:54:18,728 --> 02:54:19,922
Who?

1561
02:54:20,597 --> 02:54:22,827
"I'm here, Paro"

1562
02:54:55,098 --> 02:54:59,091
"What is the matter, Parvati?
- Someone called out to me"

1563
02:55:00,436 --> 02:55:05,806
So late at night? Go to bed.
You must be mistaken

1564
02:55:18,521 --> 02:55:21,251
Picked him up at Pandua station.
I don't knoW...

1565
02:55:21,591 --> 02:55:24,116
"something happened to him overnight.
Never said Where to, in Manikpur"

1566
02:55:32,535 --> 02:55:36,130
What's that croWd outside?

1567
02:55:36,639 --> 02:55:42,077
"Some stranger has been lying there
all night. Counting his last, maybe"

1568
02:55:42,812 --> 02:55:46,771
"Poor soul, must've come to return
something he oWed in this lifetime"

1569
02:55:50,553 --> 02:55:52,544
God rest his soul

1570
02:55:57,493 --> 02:56:00,360
"No chance of survival,
Mahendra Babu"

1571
02:56:01,364 --> 02:56:03,355
He's breathing his last

1572
02:56:07,837 --> 02:56:11,238
She is manifest in Death

1573
02:56:11,574 --> 02:56:15,237
She is the life-force

1574
02:56:42,272 --> 02:56:44,001
"What is the matter, Parvati?"

1575
02:56:48,544 --> 02:56:51,069
These letters might provide a clue

1576
02:56:51,547 --> 02:56:54,539
She is Eternal peace

1577
02:56:58,554 --> 02:57:05,653
"If you are inattentive Parvati,
you needn't say the prayers. Leave"

1578
02:57:09,432 --> 02:57:13,368
"For some Wish unfulfilled, must be,
he isn't giving up his ghost"

1579
02:57:13,703 --> 02:57:18,572
The policeman has identified him.
He's from some Tal Sonapur

1580
02:57:23,146 --> 02:57:25,171
What's the name?
- I don't knoW

1581
02:57:25,581 --> 02:57:29,278
Mahendra Babu knoWs.
- Will you please call Mahendra?

1582
02:57:33,389 --> 02:57:35,823
"I said, call Mahendra.
- Yes"

1583
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:47,536
Yes?
- Chhoti-Ma Wants to see you. NoW

1584
02:58:02,218 --> 02:58:07,155
"Yes Chhoti-Ma? You summoned me?
- Yes, Who's the man lying outside?"

1585
02:58:07,557 --> 02:58:10,048
"Someone from your village,
one Devdas Mukherjee"

1586
02:58:13,563 --> 02:58:16,555
Who?
- Devdas Mukherjee

1587
02:58:22,705 --> 02:58:24,696
HoW do you knoW?
- TWo letters in his pocket

1588
02:58:24,941 --> 02:58:26,932
"One, to DWijdas Mukherjee.
- His elder brother"

1589
02:58:27,276 --> 02:58:28,573
"And to one Kaushalya.
- Yes, his mother"

1590
02:58:28,711 --> 02:58:31,043
The name Was tattooed on his arm.
- At a fair. It rained

1591
02:58:31,381 --> 02:58:33,315
Incomplete tattoo...
- Also a torn necklace of pearls

1592
02:58:33,649 --> 02:58:35,583
Hit me here...

1593
02:58:42,325 --> 02:58:43,587
Where are you going Chhoti-Ma?

1594
02:58:43,726 --> 02:58:45,717
By noW
they must've taken him aWay

1595
02:58:51,501 --> 02:58:53,594
"Chhoti-Ma, stop..."

1596
02:59:05,314 --> 02:59:08,408
What happened to Chhoti Ma?
- What's going on in this house?

1597
02:59:08,751 --> 02:59:11,151
Why this screaming?
What's up Mahendra?

1598
02:59:11,487 --> 02:59:15,617
"Ma is going out! For some Devdas!
- She has gone insane, stop her"

1599
02:59:16,325 --> 02:59:18,316
"Stop, Parvati!"

1600
02:59:18,728 --> 02:59:20,958
Don't let her step
outside the manor

1601
02:59:51,294 --> 02:59:53,592
Stop Chhoti-Ma

1602
02:59:55,598 --> 02:59:59,398
Stop! Babu-ji forbids you

1603
03:00:17,620 --> 03:00:21,021
Secure the doors

1604
03:01:12,808 --> 03:01:16,005
Where Will I find again...

1605
03:01:17,380 --> 03:01:19,371
my lost innocence...

1606
03:01:20,483 --> 03:01:22,280
my lost dreams...

1607
03:01:23,619 --> 03:01:25,610
my lost childhood

1608
03:01:26,622 --> 03:01:28,954
Where is gone the shade of trees...

1609
03:01:29,425 --> 03:01:31,359
Where I made myself a home? S
