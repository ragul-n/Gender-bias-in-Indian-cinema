1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,958
Can't reach them on
phone as well...!

3
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,666
I’m going to slap him!
He screwed our wedding trip.

4
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:44,125
Leave...
- You won't do anything!

5
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,500
Wait till he fixes this mess.
Will deal him after that.

6
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,333
Did it hurt?

7
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:02,916
Ammu!

8
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,458
Aunty, it is a bad omen..

9
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:11,625
..to get held up mid way
soon after the wedding.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,750
Try now...

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,666
What on earth are you doing!

12
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,291
It's your wedding dress!

13
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,583
Shame!

14
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,708
Move aside, let me get in.

15
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,250
Hope there isn't another
breakdown awaiting us...

16
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:25,875
Like the dazzling moon in the night sky,
And lips as beautiful as the red sky

17
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:30,166
Why can't I take
my eyes off her!

18
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:43,791
Have you ever seen or heard of
anyone who celebrated like this!

19
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:02,291
When celebrations hits the peak,
bliss becomes the rhythm of life,

20
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,416
And the village
revels in unison!

21
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:19,707
Have you ever seen or heard of
anyone who celebrated like this!

22
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,875
Good for those who came by one's own,
because those who came together got waylaid.

23
00:04:55,916 --> 00:05:00,250
And the village got its
new share of tales!

24
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,791
With their friends and family beside,
finally they tie that nuptial knot.

25
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:09,291
And the celebration begins!

26
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:22,791
Like the dazzling moon in the night sky,
And lips as beautiful as the red sky

27
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:27,041
Why can't I take
my eyes off her?

28
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,833
Have you ever seen or heard of
anyone who celebrated like this!

29
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:50,125
With their friends and family beside,
finally they tie that nuptial knot.

30
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:54,332
And the celebration begins!

31
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,708
Finally they tie
that nuptial knot

32
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,500
and the celebration begins!

33
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,291
Finally they tie
that nuptial knot

34
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,125
and the celebration begins!

35
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,833
Sit down.

36
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,666
What?
Aren't you feeling well?

37
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,666
Move aside.

38
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,208
Move aside.

39
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,083
Not again!

40
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,500
How many times have
I told these two,

41
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,958
to kill that creature somehow!

42
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,333
Oh, you are awake...

43
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,750
Go... Brush.

44
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,625
Breakfast is ready.

45
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,958
Chandran? He already
had his breakfast.

46
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,291
Woke up late...

47
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,665
It's that wild boar which
created this mess!

48
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,041
Don’t you have school today?

49
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,625
It’s vacation time.

50
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,500
Yesterday on the way,
didn’t you see my school?

51
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,250
No

52
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,083
Often elephants cross
our school road.

53
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,291
Are there elephants here?
- Yes! We have everything here.

54
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,958
Boars, tigers, elephants...
Everything!

55
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,915
Last week a baby elephant
came across to have water.

56
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,000
It got stuck in
the marsh nearby.

57
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,291
It stood there helplessly for an entire
day, before dragging itself out.

58
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,291
Sudha...

59
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:31,958
Let me go then.

60
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,625
I would like to call home.

61
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,000
You can’t make any calls from here.
There isn't any range.

62
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,000
What? Bitch!

63
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,125
Please have your
breakfast and go.

64
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,333
Come.

65
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,416
How much did I give Unni
the other day? 500?

66
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,375
Yeah, 500.

67
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:47,375
Auto cost 300, JCB cost...

68
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,000
Will you ever get over this?

69
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,750
As if you have
something else to do!

70
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:56,041
I am the one held responsible
by the Contractor.

71
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,958
Please give us our share!

72
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,166
1, 2, 3...

73
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,208
4...

74
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,208
5...

75
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,208
6... 7...

76
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,250
7... 7...

77
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:10,374
When is this year’s
Pepper auction?

78
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:12,708
Could be next month.

79
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:16,499
Last year, our Contractor won
the auction for 31 lakhs.

80
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:21,374
He weeps even now claiming
that it was a huge loss!

81
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,665
As if we don't know!

82
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,833
Hey, listen...
I have another offer.

83
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:27,665
What is it?

84
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:32,708
Government has issued an order to
cut down dried and withered trees.

85
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,208
A friend of mine has got the tender.
- Anything in for us?

86
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,791
Yes, but cutting the dried
up trees alone won't do!

87
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,083
Just tell us what we must do.

88
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,250
Come... Let’s go.

89
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,041
See you.

90
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,500
I don't know if any of his
plans will ever work!

91
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,582
Ridiculous! Are you rejoining
work today! Shame!

92
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,541
Why are you here today itself!

93
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,500
Why don't you show
the girl around?

94
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,416
What is there to see?

95
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,500
Some half dead people, some
boars and a few wild buffalos!

96
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:18,541
I pity the girl's fate
for marrying you!

97
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,625
Okay then, I am going
to the valley.

98
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,457
By the way,

99
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,250
don’t skim on our work just
because you got married.

100
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:54,832
That boar is persistent on
destroying all our crops!

101
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,583
If he even dares to
destroys this...

102
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,250
I’ll catch him and fry, even
if the police arrests me!

103
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,958
All this wild boar
menace is new to me.

104
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,208
Ammu said elephants
come down here.

105
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,833
Mother, do you know how to switch
off the Light in our room?

106
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,666
Those are his
precious belongings.

107
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,208
He doesn’t let us
touch any of it.

108
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,916
I’m not used to sleeping
with lights on,

109
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,916
so I fall asleep really late.

110
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,582
He falls asleep the
moment he lies down!

111
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,750
When he was a child, he
was afraid of the darkness.

112
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,416
I don't think it has
changed even now.

113
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,000
He is always seen
working on that Light.

114
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,000
Whose is the broken
house beside ours?

115
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,500
A Tamilian, Sahayam (Helper).

116
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,708
But I’ve never seen
him "help" anyone.

117
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,500
When he left this place for one at the
valley, Chandran had asked it for rent.

118
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,958
He wanted an unbearable sum.

119
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,250
Now, see what has happened!
The house lies in ruins!

120
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,332
How many families are
there in this village?

121
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,750
May be around 100-150 families.

122
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,125
When I came here, there
were over 2000 families!

123
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,708
Really?

124
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,416
When I was brought here
after marriage, this was

125
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,625
the most beautiful place
I had seen till then.

126
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,875
Those days it wasn’t like this.

127
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:33,791
Huge factory buildings, giant machines,
buzzing workers, shops and what not.

128
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,125
Even the breeze here is
filled with the aroma of

129
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,916
fresh cardamom and cinnamon.

130
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,166
Have you heard the sound of
wind blowing in the mountains?

131
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,957
Even that has a
memorable rhythm...

132
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,457
This place was alive
with budding tea leaves.

133
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,582
Now it’s all gone.

134
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,875
One day this place
started withering away.

135
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,500
Broken and debt ridden,

136
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,457
the owner stopped looking
after the plantation.

137
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,291
Those who had some money left with
them, found new homes in the valley.

138
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,416
Unfortunate few like us, got
left behind, in this wilderness.

139
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,666
It’s a bit cold outside.

140
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,625
Have kept hot water for bathing.

141
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:04,166
Are you angry at me?

142
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:08,666
Tell me if you need groceries.
I am going to the valley tomorrow.

143
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:09,708
Shall I come too?

144
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:11,666
Needn’t.

145
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,166
Mother said you like tapioca,

146
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,500
so I made some for dinner...

147
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,916
Do you come this late every day?

148
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:32,250
The motor at the mill broke down.
Went to repair it.

149
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,582
If you can repair such things,

150
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,208
can’t you fix a switch to
the Light in our room.

151
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,582
Don't bother.

152
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,458
Stay away. I don’t like
anyone messing with it.

153
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:41,832
Why?

154
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,666
Don't teach me what
to do in my house!

155
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,666
That Light is the
invention of my life!

156
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,416
Invention!

157
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,041
Even at our festivals we have
lights that change color.

158
00:23:56,833 --> 00:24:00,125
How dare you!

159
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,750
Don't you dare open
your mouth again.

160
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:47,875
Mother,
- Yes.

161
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:50,291
I am taking lunch for him.

162
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,291
I just missed the lottery by 6 numbers!
5000 Rupees!

163
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,375
What a waste of time!

164
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,250
I thought I’ll bring lunch.

165
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,000
Hey, she has brought fresh
homemade food for you!

166
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,125
Thoran (a side dish)

167
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Mizhukk Varatty (a side dish)

168
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,500
There is enough for two!

169
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:49,125
I assumed that the Landlord
would be here as well. So...

170
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,250
Let me see how good
your cooking is.

171
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,957
Just because I've put some
money to start this shop,

172
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,458
don’t think of me
as the landlord!

173
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,250
Your husband is still very
much the landlord in here.

174
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,457
Why are you roaming around
places you don’t know?

175
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,166
Don’t you have common sense?

176
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,332
I... to bring food...

177
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,083
I did not live all these
years being fed by you.

178
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:25,625
Don’t you ever step out of the house
without my consent. Now get lost!

179
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,791
Don’t you know how to
behave with a woman?

180
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,375
What is your problem?

181
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:41,875
Is it that she came here alone?

182
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,958
I know how to make her behave!

183
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,416
What the hell is wrong with you!

184
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,666
Or is it your father’s
ghost returning?

185
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,833
I know what this is.

186
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,916
Complex. Inferiority complex.

187
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
That’s it.

188
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,708
What is this old woman!

189
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,583
Isn't there anything
good to eat?

190
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,500
Don’t talk rubbish.

191
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:27,541
That girl made everything
just this evening.

192
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:30,250
What is there so much to make?

193
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,416
You just need to put
some rice and that's it!

194
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,875
Where were you the
last two days?

195
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,750
Went to get my dead
father married off.

196
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:57,582
Doesn’t anything good ever come
out of that mouth of yours!

197
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,625
I would like to get
this window repaired...

198
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:54,708
And may be put a door here?

199
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,125
Why not I build a
new house for you!

200
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,416
I can’t even change...

201
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,541
No one in this forest wants
to watch you change clothes!

202
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:05,041
Someone who slept at a corner of a distant
relative's house, now wants a palace!

203
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,041
Moths have eaten a part of it!

204
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:54,832
See if this is sufficient.

205
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,458
Yeah, this is just fine.

206
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,041
You don’t be angry at him.

207
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:09,750
He has always been hotheaded.

208
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:14,207
Ramesh is bothered
only of himself.

209
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:18,125
For the money he makes, he gets drunk,
buys clothes and enjoys himself.

210
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,291
He never gave me a single rupee.

211
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,541
When his father was bedridden,

212
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,041
it was Chandran who took
care of everything.

213
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,500
Shall I also go for some work?

214
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,041
To be a help for him?

215
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:31,750
No! Don’t ask anything about it to him.
He might not like it at all.

216
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:58,166
Could you ask him to fix
a switch for that Light?

217
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:01,541
I understand your problem,
but he won't realise it.

218
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,916
Let me try telling him.

219
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,582
Give me that hammer.
I’ll help you with it.

220
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,291
Chandran, your porridge
is getting cold.

221
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,500
The light outside isn't working.
- Shall check it tomorrow.

222
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,583
Can’t you put a switch to
that Light in your room?

223
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,916
It is difficult for her
to even change her dress...

224
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,583
Bitch! I’ve lost my
peace after marriage.

225
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,250
She was living in someone’s
kitchen after her parents died.

226
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,750
Now our home is not
safe enough for her!

227
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:46,958
If you mouth her words again,
I’ll kick you both out.

228
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,041
You can’t kick me out!

229
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,833
My husband made this house.

230
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,208
What about the debts he made?

231
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,541
First him. Now you.

232
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:54,791
I’ve had enough.

233
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,500
I just want to leave
this wretched land.

234
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:00,250
Will you get peace if I die?

235
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,333
Just a minute.

236
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,333
He hasn't come home yesterday.

237
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,333
He might have slept
off at the shop.

238
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:46,750
Can you please check?

239
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,208
This is all usual here.
No use checking.

240
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,916
Chandran! Get Up!

241
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,041
You’ve slept enough...

242
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,666
Now get up.

243
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:41,208
Life is not the same anymore.

244
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,000
Now there is a girl
waiting at home.

245
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,041
Unable to work from home.

246
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:49,666
By the way, any news from the
company representatives?

247
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,791
Yeah. They had
called yesterday...

248
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:57,458
Asked us to finish our work soon and
show them a working model of the Light.

249
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,250
I have asked for some time by
informing them about your marriage.

250
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,166
Is everything alright
between you and Sudha?

251
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:08,083
Didn't I take your approval
before arranging this wedding?

252
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,375
What is your problem now?

253
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,541
She is a small girl...

254
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,666
That too a lot younger than you.

255
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,333
She might have some
immaturity of her age.

256
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,625
You guys leave,
I shall come soon.

257
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,708
Oh... You are here!

258
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:28,958
Brother, when you have time, teach him
how to tame a girl after marriage!

259
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:32,208
You better leave!
- Yeah, I am not staying either!

260
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,000
Aren’t you coming?

261
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,500
Yeah, I’m coming. Have the
workers reached the spot?

262
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:40,458
They reached a while back.
- You go ahead. I’ll join.

263
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:47,625
Today is the first day of that contract to
cut down those trees. Let me go and check.

264
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:51,875
By the way, I’ve settled your bills
at the computer centre in the valley.

265
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:53,916
Do you need any money?

266
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,875
No.

267
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:56,333
Tell me if you need!

268
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:57,791
I don’t need anything now.

269
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,416
Are you drunk?

270
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,708
Don’t make a sound.

271
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,666
That wretched animal!

272
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:17,041
It won't allow us
to live in peace!

273
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,000
We’ve lost all our crops...

274
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,166
Everything! That ugly creature!

275
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:26,666
Even the cracker
bursting went useless.

276
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:28,500
Everything is gone...

277
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:51,458
Hey Chandran. What is this with
the bottles and doll!

278
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Try blowing this whistle.
- What?

279
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:54,333
Just give it a try.

280
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,291
What whistle is this!
Doesn’t even make a sound!

281
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:06,875
Blow it close to the bottle and
look into the doll’s eyes.

282
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,250
Wow!

283
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:12,375
This is so cool!

284
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,958
Weren’t you asking what I was
wasting all your money on?

285
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,083
This is it.

286
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,666
What? In making whistles
and bottles?

287
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:21,375
Brother, there are lots
of sounds around us

288
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,083
which we can’t hear.
Especially here.

289
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:25,541
This whistle makes such a sound.

290
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,958
These bottles turn
because of that sound,

291
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:31,291
because their frequencies match.

292
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,166
The current produced by this
rotation, makes the light glow.

293
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,541
That's what I’m trying to make.

294
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:42,166
A Light that works on the current
produced by Ultrasonic sounds.

295
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:46,666
As the frequency changes, the
colour of this light changes.

296
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:50,416
I am yet to figure out how to
make this light last long.

297
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:51,791
That's enough.

298
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:54,083
I can’t follow what
you are saying.

299
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:55,333
Get me that diary.

300
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,416
But,

301
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:06,125
I now see that there is some
sense to all your madness.

302
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,666
I trust you. Go ahead.

303
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:11,125
I’m with you!

304
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:15,708
Unni.

305
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,750
Is Chandran inside?
- Yeah, he's there.

306
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:21,083
Hey... Have you
repaired our motor?

307
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,708
Haven’t you finished this yet!
- Come tomorrow.

308
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:27,125
This won’t do.

309
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:29,250
Fixing your crap is not the
only thing I do. Leave.

310
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:31,916
Not you bullshit again! If you
weren’t Ramesh’s brother...

311
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,541
Huh? What would you do?

312
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:34,916
I shall show him
how to fix this!

313
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,375
Somehow fix it brother.

314
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:40,416
It’s been days since we gave that motor.
He hasn’t done a thing about it.

315
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:43,208
Making a fuss isn't
going to help either.

316
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,291
Listen to me. Come.

317
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:53,250
Here... Drink this...

318
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:54,750
You’ll feel better.

319
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,250
Hey... Look who is here!

320
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:15,916
Is sister inside?

321
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,625
She is. Go in.

322
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:27,541
What's this?

323
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,041
I made it.

324
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:32,041
It looks good.

325
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:35,583
Shall I show you something?

326
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:01,708
How is it?

327
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,833
What's it?

328
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:51,166
Chandran!

329
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,875
Is uncle’s daughter
getting married?

330
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,000
Yes.

331
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,416
Where is the groom from?

332
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,041
Somewhere north.

333
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:22,041
Will it happen at
least this time?

334
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,375
Don’t talk nonsense.

335
00:52:24,416 --> 00:52:25,958
Lets see.

336
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:27,416
Makes no difference
to me anyway.

337
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,000
Why are you not saying anything?

338
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:39,833
When are you going to finish that Light?
- I don’t know.

339
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,125
Again the same thing!

340
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:47,916
We promised to give them a working
model by the end of this month.

341
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:52,041
What am I to do if you keep saying this!
- It’s you who gave the word.

342
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,208
What! How dare you
talk like this to me!

343
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,500
What else should I say?

344
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:04,750
If the company accepts your model,
all your problems will be over.

345
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,625
The world will know
of your invention!

346
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:09,500
You can build a new
house in the valley.

347
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:11,958
That too a fantastic one.

348
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:15,541
Yeah... I too will get
some money out of it.

349
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,916
So somehow you get this done!

350
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,666
I’d like to go home.

351
00:53:58,083 --> 00:53:59,958
Mother has approved.
- Who?

352
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:01,916
I make decisions here. Not her.

353
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,583
You are not going...

354
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:06,166
I’ll go home and...
- Home? Which home? Whose home?

355
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:09,125
Your mother is no more. You don’t
even know who your father is.

356
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,125
Then to which home
are you going to?

357
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:14,166
First find out who your father is
and then we can think of the rest.

358
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:17,583
Whoever my father may have been,
he knew how to love a woman!

359
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:31,250
I’ll finish you here.

360
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,500
Once that load too is sent,
we’ll get a hefty payment.

361
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,666
Where are you going?
- For a dip in the stream.

362
00:54:56,708 --> 00:54:57,708
You come here a moment.

363
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,041
You need to stop wasting time.

364
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,833
You should get married
and settle down.

365
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:05,750
I can see at home how one
"settles" down after a marriage.

366
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:07,333
That is nothing.

367
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:11,333
Once there is a baby in
the house, he’ll change.

368
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,833
Your mother always
keep saying this.

369
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,000
She has gone crazy!

370
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:18,583
Go home brother...!

371
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:53,583
Don’t worry. He better
not mess with me.

372
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,041
Give me the glass.

373
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,666
Did you call Unni?

374
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:02,958
Who is going to call him!

375
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,208
Come here you bitch!

376
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,666
You bitch...

377
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,958
All your pain will
vanish with this.

378
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:45,250
My husband also used to beat
me up when I was your age!

379
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,500
Memories of that pain are
still fresh in my mind.

380
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Chandran grew up watching that.

381
00:59:57,208 --> 00:59:58,833
But what happened in the end?

382
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:06,250
When my husband was sick, he
needed me to take care of him.

383
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:10,041
Couldn’t even get up on his own.

384
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:15,500
I think during those days
he repented his deeds.

385
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:17,916
You shouldn’t hate him.

386
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:20,166
After all, you are a woman!

387
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:25,833
As far as possible, try
not to make him angry.

388
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:28,500
Only problem is his
hot headedness.

389
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,875
Else he is very loving.

390
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:32,875
Come, come inside.

391
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:35,166
Stay with your sister
for some time.

392
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:47,625
O dear twilight...

393
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:55,166
In the winds of grief,
don't fade far away.

394
01:03:56,166 --> 01:04:02,375
Hidden somewhere far away,

395
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:11,375
You are like a painful melody...

396
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:16,666
The silence inside me,

397
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:21,041
stands detached,

398
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:25,791
killing my spirit...

399
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:34,000
Which sky can shed soft rains,..

400
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:42,583
..in my heavy heart gently?

401
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:33,666
In the walks of dark,

402
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:38,250
when I stand drenched in tears,

403
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:46,375
Which moonlight blinked
its first rays on me?

404
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:51,833
Which symphonies
filled my heart?

405
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:24,416
When even these present
days of mine...

406
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:28,625
Gets withered away
in the embers...

407
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:37,166
Which harmonies gently
healed my wounds?

408
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:43,333
Which symphonies
filled my heart?

409
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:17,291
Hey! Hey!

410
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,958
Place the wood on the other side.
To load it to the truck.

411
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,875
Unni, come here.

412
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,416
You know what to do. Start
the trip only at night.

413
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,500
Brother, everything
is safe, right?

414
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:37,958
The contractor has dealt the
matter at the check post.

415
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,458
It’s not that brother.

416
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,916
Go and work. Go.

417
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:55,791
Don't waste time chatting you fools!
Get it done. Quick.

418
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:58,625
Don’t take this
personally Chandran.

419
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,041
This is not going to work.

420
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,208
I invested money
believing in you.

421
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:06,458
It is not the company’s requirement.
It’s ours.

422
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:12,916
I’ll wait for another week.
I've waited enough.

423
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:15,250
If you can’t get
it done, tell me.

424
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,374
What other option do you have?

425
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:18,791
Are you messing with me?

426
01:08:19,249 --> 01:08:25,832
You give me what you’ve made so far.
I'll get someone else to finish it.

427
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:53,290
Hey! Ramesh has dug
the boar trap.

428
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:56,666
Close it after putting
those bamboo sticks.

429
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:22,374
What is this?

430
01:09:22,832 --> 01:09:23,707
A trap to catch that wild boar.

431
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:26,957
How?

432
01:09:27,499 --> 01:09:32,499
At night when it comes to eat our
tapioca it will get on top of this.

433
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:33,791
Then?

434
01:09:35,374 --> 01:09:38,957
Then, it will fall into
this pit with a ‘thump’.

435
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:43,333
When those sharp bamboo
sticks pierce his body,

436
01:09:44,124 --> 01:09:45,582
it will cry out loud.

437
01:09:45,874 --> 01:09:47,374
Won’t it die then?

438
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:49,874
If it doesn’t let us live,

439
01:09:51,082 --> 01:09:53,040
we should just finish it off.

440
01:09:53,707 --> 01:09:55,833
Won’t the police catch you?

441
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:59,416
Even if a human dies here,
no one will come this way.

442
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:32,708
It's a hailstorm.

443
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,458
You go and sleep.

444
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:39,583
Go sleep.

445
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,790
Scorpions have come
out after the rains.

446
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:03,208
They are poisonous.
Be careful dear.

447
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:08,290
I’m going to my brother’s
house day after.

448
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,375
His daughter’s wedding
is approaching.

449
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,625
I will ask Chandran
to go there with you.

450
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:18,208
What is it?

451
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,250
A scorpion.

452
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:21,666
Careful. It is poisonous.

453
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:22,875
This can’t kill anyone!

454
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:25,458
They are out after the
rains have started.

455
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,125
Hey, Chandran.

456
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:19,708
Isn’t he up yet!

457
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,916
Dear, isn’t he here?

458
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:23,790
Come inside brother.

459
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,083
Finally! You have fixed it!

460
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,333
Fantastic!

461
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:34,333
Just wait and see!

462
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:37,540
I’ll go tomorrow itself to
meet the company people.

463
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:39,875
Everything is going to
be great from now on.

464
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:46,041
Don't you know how
to treat a guest?

465
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:48,625
Useless!

466
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:51,000
What is this?

467
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:54,583
Nothing dear. Nothing.

468
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:57,541
I’ll get some liquor
for the evening.

469
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:03,666
Brother,

470
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:05,750
why aren’t we opening this?

471
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:06,791
Yes. Yes... Go On.

472
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,208
It was difficult
to get the stuff.

473
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:20,125
He was relentless for
foreign brands today!

474
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:23,583
Today is a very
important day for me!

475
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:25,875
Oh yeah!

476
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,000
Pass me my glass.

477
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,750
Enjoy!

478
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,375
It's worth every penny!

479
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:04,625
Hey Madhu,

480
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:08,041
let's make this a celebration.

481
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,875
What was that song of yours?

482
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:14,208
"Anthi kadappurath"? (An
old Malayalam Song)

483
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,250
Sing.

484
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,250
Brother...

485
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,208
I will just come...

486
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,540
Where are you going? He
might want to take a piss!

487
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:45,666
You!

488
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,875
Haven’t I told you
not to touch that?

489
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:54,708
Bitch.

490
01:18:58,416 --> 01:19:00,000
What is going on? - Ignore.

491
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:03,166
What is he doing?
- That is all usual. You sing.

492
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:06,125
Shall I fix you another drink?

493
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,041
Brother! Do you
want another drink?

494
01:19:16,291 --> 01:19:18,875
Rice is kept on the stove.
Do pay attention to it.

495
01:19:19,416 --> 01:19:21,333
I’m going to the wedding house.

496
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:22,791
Will be back before night.

497
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,208
Are you coming or not?
- Coming, coming.

498
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,541
Then come!

499
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,958
Take care.

500
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,041
Chandran! Chandran!

501
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:09,250
Where is he? Is he still asleep?

502
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:10,625
He is. Should I call?

503
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,375
Hey!

504
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:15,541
Get up.

505
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,958
Why are you still sleeping?
We need to go.

506
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:20,208
Come quick.

507
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:27,875
Is the gas open dear?

508
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,875
Is there something on the stove?

509
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:32,541
The water might have over flown.

510
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:35,083
Open that kitchen window
and door quickly.

511
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,833
It might be raining
at the mountains.

512
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,915
Don’t go into the stream.

513
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:15,375
The flow will be
stronger than usual.

514
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:31,000
You both have to go to
uncle’s house tomorrow.

515
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:33,915
The wedding is nearing.

516
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,625
They all had helped a
lot for your wedding.

517
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:41,166
Your cousins Rateesh and Biju have arrived.
They asked for you as well.

518
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:43,583
They are yet to meet her also.

519
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:46,166
So you have to go.

520
01:23:46,208 --> 01:23:47,165
Will see.

521
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:49,833
You have to go!

522
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:52,375
Otherwise what will they think!

523
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:38,041
Dear, take this umbrella.

524
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,000
It’ll rain.

525
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:20,291
For the hillocks to flower,

526
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:24,333
There comes one
from the unknown.

527
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:31,500
Sprouting like a shining dream.

528
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:37,375
For my eyes to see,

529
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:41,166
For me to lock hands,

530
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:48,250
I need you like a shadow
to go far and wide.

531
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:54,291
I came to flow like a river,

532
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:58,000
with the dings of your
anklet pampering me gently.

533
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:10,958
I came with high hopes,

534
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,125
to touch the clouds.

535
01:26:15,166 --> 01:26:22,583
Just like a feather
in the light wind.

536
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:27,875
For my eyes to see,

537
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:31,791
For me to lock hands,

538
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:38,250
I need you like a shadow
to go far and wide.

539
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:05,000
Words that rained like dreams,

540
01:27:05,041 --> 01:27:09,125
is dripping again on my path.

541
01:27:09,166 --> 01:27:13,458
By lighting a lamp in my eyes,

542
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:17,708
I pursue the roads that
are yet to be traveled.

543
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:26,083
The time when birds coo
in the dripping branches,

544
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:30,333
Lend me your shoulder and

545
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:34,375
join me in my life journey!

546
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:38,666
Come dear.

547
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:45,791
Shall we leave?

548
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:49,290
Why the hell did
you come here now?

549
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:53,165
You start. She might
have got bored.

550
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:56,458
Oh no. It’s difficult to go back
in the night. That's why...

551
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,833
If being bored is her problem,

552
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:01,083
she’ll dance for all of you.

553
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:03,750
A dance! Now that's
what we were missing.

554
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:04,625
Brother,

555
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:08,375
if she has to dance, you will
defenitely have to sing!

556
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:10,833
That shouldn't be a problem.

557
01:28:12,875 --> 01:28:15,875
My dear, if that's a deal
please show us a step.

558
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:18,541
At least then we can hear
this moron sing a song!

559
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:27,415
(Old Malayalam Folk Song)

560
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:38,666
What?

561
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:41,125
Are you deaf?

562
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:44,833
Didn't I ask you to dance!

563
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:48,833
Chandran! Don't you dare do
this nonsense when drunk!

564
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,083
Don’t you dare teach me how
to behave with my wife!

565
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,250
Get lost.

566
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:40,125
Just get lost I say.

567
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,500
Hold me.

568
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:14,583
Hold this.

569
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:18,333
Help!

570
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:35,041
Where is that old woman?

571
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,958
Mother went to the
neighbor’s house.

572
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,666
So many times I have heard your
painful screams from this room!

573
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:00,333
But then I used to blame him.

574
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:03,415
Now I realise that I was wrong!

575
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:07,416
Anyone would want to
make you cry out loud!

576
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:13,250
Do you think you can survive in
this house without yielding to me?

577
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,166
Have you seen death Ramesh?

578
01:35:18,666 --> 01:35:20,541
That too right in
front of your eyes?

579
01:35:21,666 --> 01:35:22,916
I have.

580
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:26,333
My own husband’s death.

581
01:35:27,166 --> 01:35:30,333
He was screaming a lot
louder than I did.

582
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,583
For help.

583
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:38,666
Even as I watched him
die, I did not flinch.

584
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:41,916
Neither was I scared.

585
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:43,165
You bitch!

586
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:44,250
Lower you voice!

587
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:46,375
Mother will be here anytime...
