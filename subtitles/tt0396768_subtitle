1
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,750
Rama, you haven't gone to bed yet?

2
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,625
Looking for solution to your helplessness in law books?

3
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:35,750
I was looking for a solution to this problem.

4
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,666
There is a solution, but your ego..

5
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,833
Rama.

6
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:45,500
As a wife, I never asked for anything from you.

7
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,083
But as a mother, I cannot keep quiet..

8
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,625
and allow my child to be sacrificed.

9
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:59,875
Who you have reared as a mother is related to me too.

10
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,750
Even I have loved him as a father.

11
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,083
And today, sitting in the chair of justice..

12
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,041
you are desperate to give your verdict.

13
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,625
The law will punish the wrongdoers.

14
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:15,833
Is a brother saying this, or Judge Ravi Khanna?

15
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,958
Right now, a brother is talking.

16
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,875
No, even now, a judge sitting on the chair of blind law is talking.

17
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,291
I am only doing my duty.

18
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,375
I am not talking of law, court or witness box.

19
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,208
I am talking of this home and those who live here.

20
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,375
This is not a family matter. If it was..

21
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:42,416
I would get angry as a brother, scold, reprimand, and fall silent

22
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:47,375
But this is a matter of law. And sitting in the chair of justice..

23
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,416
I cannot do injustice.

24
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,291
Injustice is being done now.

25
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:56,000
Rama, don't forget he's a murderer.

26
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,833
Pardon me, it's not been proved yet that he's committed the murder

27
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,833
As a judge, you have no right to give this decision right now.

28
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,833
I'm sorry, I'd forgotten.

29
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,041
You are forgetting a lot.

30
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,375
But I still remember a few loopholes of law.

31
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,083
If you will make your brother stand in the box..

32
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,750
even I will stand as a rock against you and try to save him.

33
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,583
Today's headlines!

34
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,250
Murderer Sumeet Khanna to be presented in court tomorrow..

35
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,333
Today's headlines!

36
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:42,916
Yes, I have spoken. Someone has to take the step.

37
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,958
Any way Thanks a lot hold on.

38
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,166
Hello Yes, I'm leaving now.

39
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes Mr. Verma.. I have decided.

40
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,666
No, I don't need to take anyone's permission in this case.

41
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,875
Keep the papers ready, I'm leaving.

42
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you.

43
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,125
I am going to court. - Yes. - Today..

44
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,333
Please! don't say anything today.

45
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,791
Even I was going to tell you that.

46
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:22,083
Like always, don't wish me good luck today.

47
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,250
But you can wish me good luck.

48
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,750
You can bless me to succeed.

49
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,333
Good luck, Thank you.

50
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,250
Won't you come along?

51
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:41,208
I would, if you came as a husband, or a brother.

52
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,500
We want justice.

53
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,583
Please do justice.

54
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,416
Your brother is a murderer. He's killed 5 innocent college students.

55
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,083
Will you be able to do justice to them?

56
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,500
The path your younger brother has taken as the path of justice..

57
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,666
will you be able to prove it as the path of injustice?

58
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,583
The murderer is your younger brother.

59
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,000
Could it be that while giving verdict, your blood compels you?

60
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,916
Give some reply atleast.

61
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,916
You had stopped practicing.

62
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,083
Did your brother-in-law compel you to start again?

63
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:01,125
You are pitted against your husband, Justice Khanna.

64
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,416
Will justice be crushed in the fight between husband and wife?

65
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,708
Are you sure your arguments will be able to prove..

66
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,000
your brother-in-law, Sumeet, innocent?

67
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,875
The police van has come. - The murderer is in it.

68
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,375
He is very dangerous. He has committed 5 murders.

69
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,125
He has come.

70
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,458
Let the proceedings begin.

71
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,208
Accused Sumeet Khanna be present!

72
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:45,083
My Lord, this man who is standing with his head bowed..

73
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,708
this is not his true face.

74
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:51,333
His true face is hiding behind the mask of his crime.

75
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,250
His crime can never be pardoned.

76
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,208
This man who committed 7 murders..

77
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,375
if he is sentenced to death 7 times, it is not enough.

78
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,625
Point to be noted, My Lord. Please don't ignore it.

79
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,375
Thank you your honour.

80
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:12,666
My Lord, the prosecutor just now, in a very dramatic style..

81
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,041
narrated a baseless story against my client.

82
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:21,291
He even accused my client of committing 7 murders.

83
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,625
Can my colleague present a single evidence..

84
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:31,000
that proves those murders were committed by Sumeet Khanna?

85
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,000
Can my colleague give a reply..

86
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:38,375
that after loving a girl madly..

87
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,500
why did my client have to kill her?

88
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,000
Why did he have to kill a leech, drunkard photographer?

89
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,583
The murder of an infamous college student Prem..

90
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,750
Objection My Lord.

91
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:52,916
The defence lawyer is forgetting this is a murder case..

92
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,666
not a clarification case.

93
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,041
Objection sustained.

94
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,291
These things are connected to the case, Your Honor.

95
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,958
It will be better if you stick to the charge.

96
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,500
Alright, Your Honor.

97
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,250
Apart from Prem, other murders were also committed.

98
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,166
But no one saw the murders being committed.

99
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,041
Inspector Khan arrested the accused red handed..

100
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,125
at the scene of crime.

101
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,500
Your Honor, I request Inspector Khan be called to the witness box.

102
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,041
Permission granted.

103
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,041
I will speak nothing but the truth.

104
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,791
Mr. Khan, where did you arrest Sumeet?

105
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,458
In the street. - Street? - Yes.

106
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,666
I was following him from the hospital.

107
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,166
Why were you following him?

108
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,041
Because, after attacking Lorgez, he was trying to run away.

109
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,791
Attack on Lorgez?

110
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:53,208
But as per the doctor's report, Lorgez died on 28 June.

111
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,708
And you arrested Sumeet on 30 June.

112
00:13:56,791 --> 00:14:01,750
I.. - That means that Sumeet attacked Lorgez..

113
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,000
who had died two days earlier.

114
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,250
Sorry?

115
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,125
Order.. Order.. Order.

116
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,583
Inspector Khan, if Lorgez had died two days earlier..

117
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,833
on what charge did you arrest Sumeet?

118
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,458
I..

119
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,833
The court is adjourned for the day.

120
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,750
The case is not over Mr. Malhotra, it has begun.

121
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,375
I am not so foolish.

122
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,375
The intention for calling you here is to know..

123
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,333
whether you are feeling what we all are.

124
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,166
Feeling? I don't understand.

125
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,625
Despite being a lawyer, you don't understand? Strange!

126
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,625
It means that your brain is working more than all of us.

127
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,625
I don't understand your riddles.

128
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,708
My words are not a riddle.

129
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:03,041
Anyway, I'll explain. - Name of accused? - Sumeet.

130
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,708
Full name. - Sumeet Khanna.

131
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,541
The defence lawyer? - Rama Khanna.

132
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,875
The judge's name? - Ravi Khanna.

133
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,458
Which means, the murderer is Khanna..

134
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:18,000
the defence lawyer is a Khanna, and the judge is a Khanna.

135
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,791
If you sill don't understand, I'll explain it even better.

136
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,958
The younger brother a murderer, the sister-in-law a lawyer..

137
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,916
and the elder brother a judge.

138
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,000
Everyone knows that.

139
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:33,000
Then we must know this case's position and it's verdict.

140
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:36,583
Whatever we do, what these Khannas' want will happen.

141
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:40,958
Only you think so. I've spent all my life in legal circles.

142
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,750
I have won the weakest of cases. You're challenging my capability?

143
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,208
You misunderstand.

144
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,125
I am not challenging..

145
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,166
the opposition party is challenging all of us.

146
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,458
This woman will not fight the case only in court..

147
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,333
but also outside it.

148
00:15:56,416 --> 00:16:00,416
Don't forget she is the wife of Judge Khanna.

149
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,666
And Khanna will do whatever his wife says.

150
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,958
The law is not blind. - I don't know that.

151
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:11,458
I only want you to give an application to the Chief Justice..

152
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,708
and get this case transferred to another court..

153
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,875
citing the relationship between the accused & the judge.

154
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,750
Mst. Malhotra If this was possible, that's the first thing I would do.

155
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:25,041
Don't worry, my experience says the verdict will be in our favor.

156
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:32,083
Okay, we'll follow his experience.

157
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,541
Let's see who wins the case.

158
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,000
Only time will tell. - Rama you are out of your mind.

159
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,375
I'm not!

160
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,708
If you give the wrong verdict, I will go to the supreme court.

161
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,625
Why will I give the wrong verdict?

162
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,458
I don't have personal enmity with Sumeet.

163
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,833
In the court, he is an accused, and I am the judge.

164
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,666
There is no question of any relationship.

165
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:55,416
Rama, right now, the whole city's eyes are glued on me.

166
00:16:56,083 --> 00:17:00,333
Law, Press, my colleagues, the parents of the deceased..

167
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,500
everyone is looking at me like hungry vultures.

168
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,916
And I, a helpless brother..

169
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,583
is carrying the burden of my responsibility and my love.

170
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:14,833
The moment I tire and fall, the vultures will gobble me up!

171
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,083
Sumeet has only reached the court yet.

172
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,791
I was hung on the gallows the moment he got arrested.

173
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:28,291
It is surprising that I have not died yet.

174
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,875
If Lorgez had died on 28 June..

175
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,708
why was his body kept in the hospital for two days?

176
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,041
I was waiting for the killer.

177
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,000
Waiting for the killer after death?

178
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:51,541
Yes. Because I'd told the Press Lorgez is alive, not dead.

179
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,375
Any specific reason?

180
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:58,416
Lorgez Anthony was the only man who could identify the attacker.

181
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:04,000
And if this final proof, the eye witness, would identify the killer..

182
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,375
he would be trapped. That is why I played this trick.

183
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,666
And your trick worked? - Yes.

184
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,875
Then to kill Lorgez, he entered that room where his corpse was?

185
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,125
Yes. - So who entered that room?

186
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,916
Sumeet Khanna, in disguise.

187
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,750
Order .Order..

188
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,583
In what disguise? - In a doctor's guise.

189
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,000
What did Sumeet try to do after entering the room?

190
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,416
Sumeet He drew out a knife from his pocket.

191
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,791
Yes.

192
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,083
Inspector Khan, is this that knife..

193
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,791
with which he was going to attack Lorgez?

194
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,166
Objection Your Honor.

195
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,416
Not Lorgez, his corpse. - It's the same thing.

196
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,583
Thank you Inspector Khan you can go.

197
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:59,125
Your Honor, the accused tried to get the last proof..

198
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:03,041
the eye witness, out of his way.

199
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,208
He had removed Lorgez from his way two days earlier.

200
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,791
If Inspector Khan had not been wise and cunning..

201
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:14,291
the accused would be preparing to kill someone else today.

202
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:18,250
To hide his one crime, he committed six other murders.

203
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:22,083
And he started his crime with raping a girl.

204
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,833
No, that's not true!

205
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,208
Who the girl trusted, he only was raping her.

206
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,916
I did not rape anyone.

207
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,041
When she started screaming, you stifled her voice..

208
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,000
and silenced her forever.

209
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:38,125
No, I did not commit this murder.

210
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,708
Then who did you kill? The photographer? - No.

211
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,166
Prem, Pancham, Lorgez, Rani and Mona?

212
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,458
Didn't you kill all these people because they were witnesses..

213
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,541
and they had all seen you kill Anju Tell me.

214
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,375
That's not true. - It is true, you have committed these murders.

215
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,083
You killed all of them one by one.

216
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:02,833
Yes, I killed all of them! I killed them all!

217
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,625
I killed them all!

218
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,875
No Sumeet, you did not Commit any murder.

219
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,791
You are saying this under pressure. You're not in your senses.

220
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,541
No, I am in my senses. I killed them all.

221
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,208
I confess my crime.

222
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,833
But I did not kill Anju.

223
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:28,541
I loved her more than my life.

224
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,000
I loved Anju very much.

225
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,916
I loved her very much.

226
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,000
Beautiful.

227
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,708
Steady! Please.

228
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:14,375
Yeah. Yeah. That's beautiful.

230
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,541
Wait a minute.

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,291
Don't keep it down.

232
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,916
Keep your hand a little higher. - Okay.

233
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,916
That's better. One second.

234
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,250

"After coming into your arms.."

285
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,458

"After coming into your arms.."

290
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,458
It's not a question of 30% or 40%. It's a question of profit.

291
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,000
How much is the profit?

292
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,000
Call me tomorrow morning, I'll tell you.

293
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,708
Ok. Good night.

294
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:49,666
What name did you say of that boy? - Sumeet Khanna, sir.

295
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,000
Judge Ravi Khanna's younger brother? - Yes.

296
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,166
He is a very good boy, and the family is also very good.

297
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:59,375
Right now, I am worried about my family's honor.

298
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:23,750
Sumeet. - Yes. Sumeet.

299
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,000
Let's go.

300
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,708
Let's go!

301
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:34,083
'Let us not go yet..'

302
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:37,166
Mr. Lover, it is very late.

303
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,791
Let's go home.

304
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,833
Anju, promise me that your every heartbeat..

305
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,416
will be my heartbeat.

306
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,833
Your every breath will be my breath.

307
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,291
Yes Sumeet.

308
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,708
I promise.

309
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,000
You Old lady! Is this the way to promise?

310
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:06,666
So Mr.20th Century, will you tell me..

311
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,000
how a promise is made?

312
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,416
Shall I?

313
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,750
Stop.

314
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,708
Inspector, you?

315
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:28,583
I'm not an inspector, I'm a constable.

316
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,958
You look like an inspector. Right Anju?

317
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What inspector, he looks like a commissioner.

318
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:41,791
No buttering. You have been here enough.

319
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,000
This is a danger area. Leave!

320
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:50,041
Surprising! It is a crime even to speak the truth.

321
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,208
Move! - Hop on, Anju.

322
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:57,958
Bye inspector. - Bye commissioner.

323
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:05,833
Why did the house come so soon? - You have gone crazy.

324
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,875
You are responsible for it.

325
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:13,291
papa! papa! Do I look like papa to you? - Not yours, my papa!

326
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:17,541
Let's meet him. - Sumeet, please leave, or I'll be in trouble.

327
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,041
Then promise to meet me tomorrow. - I will.

328
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,958
Bay, Bay.

329
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:41,250
papa You are still awake? And this piano?

330
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,208
Yes, I'm awake because I'm a father.

331
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:47,458
And I cannot sleep because this father's young daughter..

332
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,541
has not returned home till 1 am. - Oh Papa.

333
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:53,041
And where the piano is concerned, I was playing it..

334
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,000
because the house was deserted.

335
00:29:55,541 --> 00:30:00,583
There was no one to talk to me. And I had to talk to someone.

336
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,791
I am sorry papa.

337
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,166
I will never give you cause for complain again.

338
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,708
I made a mistake.

339
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:14,000
No, I made a mistake. Being busy, I never realized..

340
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,333
my daughter has grown up.

341
00:30:16,375 --> 00:30:18,166
She doesn't need her father's home anymore.

342
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,500
What are you saying! - The fact.

343
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:24,500
I must fulfil the duty of a father now..

344
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:27,041
by finding a good boy for you. - Papa, I..

345
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,458
It is very late.

346
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:34,291
Good night, Good night papa.

347
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,666
Sir, I didn't understand the style of your love.

348
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,291
Even I don't understand it.

349
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:22,125
Instead of writing the letter, you could have spoken to her.

350
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,833
When a daughter grows up, mothers say such things.

351
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,500
But Anju is not destined to a mother's love.

352
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,750
You have given her the love of both, mother and father.

353
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:33,666
I'm trying. Anyway, are my tickets confirmed?

354
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,041
Yes sir confirmed.

355
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,416
Good morning papa.

356
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:03,750
Anju dear, all night I kept thinking why I didn't fulfill..

357
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,375
a father's duty.

358
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,833
I thought, the faster I fulfill this duty, the better.

359
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:14,166
After due thought, I decided on a family and choose a boy for you

360
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,666
I don't know how you will react to my choice.

361
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,958
I didn't have the courage to see it.

362
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:24,041
Anyway, the picture is here, see it.

363
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:33,625
I hope you like the boy. Tell me when I return..

364
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,125
whether you like my choice or..

365
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,875
One more thing. You will go to college from tomorrow.

366
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,833
You have got admission to the college of your choice.

367
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,291
Love papa.

368
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,458
I love you papa.

369
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,208
Hello Sumeet, you! I am very happy today.

370
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,625
Very good. Tell me about it.

371
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:04,750
The first good news is that I've got admission in your college.

372
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,166
Wow.

373
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:11,000
And the other good news.. No, not now.

374
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,000
I'll tell you when I meet you. - When are you meeting you?

375
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:20,208
Why, won't you take me to college on my first day?

376
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,500
Why just the first day? I'll take you always.

377
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:28,041
I'll wait for you. Bye!

378
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:31,708
Ok bay Yes.

379
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,541
Bhabhi (sister-in-law) I'm going to college.

380
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:43,583
Have breakfast and go. - Breakfast? No Bhabhi, I'm dieting.

381
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,125
On such occasions, you don't diet, it happens.

382
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,583
What occasions? - Tell him.

383
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,791
You tell him. - No, tell him.

384
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,625
You two sit and decide.

385
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,791
I'm getting late, I'll miss my class.

386
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:03,375
Miss class, but don't miss Miss.

387
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,375
What?

388
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:08,125
Don't miss Miss. Understood?

389
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,833
Go. - Okay brother.

390
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,000
Bye, bye.

391
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:15,625
See! He will become a judge or lawyer.

392
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,291
One more. - No. - Please.

393
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,000
I don't want it.

394
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:50,458
Look. Sunil.

395
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,500
Sumeet, we have to go to college, not hospital.

396
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,708
Okay, let's go to college.

397
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:13,000
Wow! she's sweet.

398
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,416
Come.

399
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,291
Wow! she's electrifying!

400
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:25,833
Hey! will you kill me?

401
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,916
Why are you standing in the middle of the road like a dustbin?

402
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,750
The municipality van will take you away as thrash.

403
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:34,375
The van is also there, and also the sweeper.

404
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:37,333
This? The municipality van is fit for you.

405
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,708
Who are you?

406
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:41,750
I am Krishna Iyer, M.A.

407
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:43,916
The bike man; understand?

408
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:50,083
The idiot spoilt my mood. What a girl she was!

409
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,250
She was amazing! I Must tell the gang.

410
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,000
Hey Guru! Wrestler. - Idiot! I'm a boxer.

411
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:03,208
Okay! Boxer. - What is it?

412
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:07,500
A new babe has come to college. - So what do I do?

413
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,375
Once you come and see, you will forget all your boxing.

414
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:14,375
Is it? - I gave you such good news, and you..

415
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:18,500
This is not news for you, it's for Prem. Where is Prem?

416
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,375
Good. - Jai Mata Di.

417
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:32,125
Pack it. - I want more money this time.

418
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,000
Who doesn't need money? - You don't understand.

419
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:39,083
A case is running on my shop. If I can get Rs.1000 more..

420
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,000
it will help. - I understand everything, Chander.

421
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,333
This is your story always. Take Rs.300.

422
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,583
I honestly need money. - It's correct.

423
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:50,666
You make so much money, can't you help me a little?

424
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:55,250
Prem yes Coming.

425
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,375
Hay baby.

426
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,541
What is the matter? You look very upset.

427
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,708
I'm getting married.

428
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:07,875
Married? You need to get married too?

429
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:11,500
Am I dead? - I plead with you, Prem.

430
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:13,958
Please give me those pictures and negatives.

431
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,458
I'll never forget that favor of yours.

432
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,166
Favor? I don't do a favor to anybody.

433
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:23,208
And this pleading also is not going to help.

434
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,041
You want the negatives? Prem your phone.

435
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,958
You will get them. Just arrange Rs.10000.

436
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,375
Rs.10000! - Only Rs.10000.

437
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,791
Where will I get the money from? - Prem, your phone.

438
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:38,708
Coming. Rani will explain that to you.

439
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,583
Explain to her. Sour.

440
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,125
Hello - Prem, where are you? - Anything special?

441
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:52,416
Very special. A babe has come to college.

442
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,916
See her once and you'll forget all your old girls.

443
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,958
Let me settle my old account first.

444
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,500
My mother reared me with so many hopes, so many dreams.

445
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:07,208
She worked hard. Seeing my mother's effort..

446
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,375
my heart cried.

447
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,000
I said, swear on one who has given birth.

448
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,625
I took a vow to fulfil my mother's dream.

449
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,041
Yes.

450
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,833
Say it in Dilip Kumar style. - Not now.

451
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,750
Don't refuse. A girl is telling you so sweetly. Go ahead.

452
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,750
Tell. Please tell.

453
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,583
My mother reared me with so many hopes, so many dreams.

454
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,333
She worked hard.

455
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,708
Seeing my mother's effort, my heart cried.

456
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:41,000
I said, I vow on river Ganges and Jamuna.

457
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,625
That I will fulfill my mother's dream.

458
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:44,791
Yes.

459
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:47,583
Now in Shatru style. - No, it won't be fun now.

460
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:51,041
Come on! - Okay.

461
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,458
So many hopes, so many dreams..

462
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,958
What's going on? - Shut-up!

463
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:28,541
Roll number 1. - Yes sir.

464
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,458
Roll number 2. - Yes sir.

465
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,416
Roll number 3. - Yes sir.

466
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Roll number 4. - Yes sir.

467
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,875
What? - She's the girl. - This one? - Yes.

468
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,375
She's really beautiful.

469
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:46,916
I said number 5.

470
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,208
Why did you stop at roll no.5, Professor?

471
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,000
Saw red light and your voice got stuck?

472
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:59,125
Keep calling. Even if you don't get a reply, mark me present.

473
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,500
Number 6. - Yes sir.

474
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:06,250
Sit down Sixer (eunuch), or you will tire.

475
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,125
Behave yourselves.

476
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:46,833
What happened, Prem?

477
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,958
How did this idiot get this babe?

478
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,083
I'll have to crush the girl's pride.

479
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:05,458
Sumeet, you take every little thing to heart.

480
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:12,875
Hello Sumeet. Hello Anita.

481
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:17,875
How are you? - I'm the same, but you look very happy.

482
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:23,500
Won't you introduce me to her? - Why not? She's Anju.

483
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,208
And she's.. - Anita.

484
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:29,250
Pleased to meet you. - And this pleasure will stay.

485
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,708
She has joined college only today.

486
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,666
Your neck will sprain, Prem.

487
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,875
Sumeet

488
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:39,541
Rani! You come and see me in my office.

489
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Now go take his firing. - Let me see how much he can fire me.

490
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,708
Where are you lost? - The poor girl is in trouble.

491
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:53,458
We'll be in trouble if we get late. - Late?

492
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:56,625
Yes. We have to buy a gift for Bhabhi. - A gift?

493
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:59,416
Tomorrow is Bhabhi's birthday. - Birthday!

494
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:41,041
"Live as one more is added to your age.."

495
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:45,375
"..and one more evening of the life has come.."

496
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:49,666
"Dance with joy in this gathering.."

497
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,125
"..as one more lamp has been lit.."

498
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:57,041
"The anklets tinked again.."

499
00:42:57,458 --> 00:43:01,250
"Again it is me and it is you.."

500
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:06,041
"The anklets tinked again.."

"..as one more lamp has been lit.."

506
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:31,416
"The anklets tinked again.."

507
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:35,916
"Again it is me and it is you.."

508
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:40,250
"The anklets tinked again.."

00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:45,708
"Again it is me and it is you.."

510
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:11,666
"She is an epitome of motherhood. She is my destiny."

511
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,833
"..she is my lovable sister-in-law.."

512
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:20,291
"If you like it then it is my desire.."

513
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:23,625
"..that I will become your queen.."

514
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:26,750
"She is an epitome of motherhood.."

515
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,916
"She is my destiny."

516
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,125
"..she is my lovable sister-in-law.."

517
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:35,375
"If you like it.."

518
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:37,541
"..then it is my desire.."

519
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:41,208
"..that I will become your queen.."

520
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:45,500
"The anklets tinked again.."

521
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:49,208
"Again it is me and it is you.."

522
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:54,041
"The anklets tinked again.."

523
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:59,541
"Again it is me and it is you.."

524
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,375
"Look at me once.."

525
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,458
"..as I have come from a far place.."

526
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:48,666
"..don't break my heart.."

527
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:53,000
"I bet that I'll surely become yours.."

528
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:57,291
"..don't leave my arms.."

529
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,791
"Look at me once as I have come from a far place.."

530
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:05,625
"..don't break my heart.."

531
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:10,416
"I bet that I'll surely become yours.."

532
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,208
"..don't leave my arms.."

533
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:17,958
"The anklets tinked again.."

534
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,958
"Again it is me and it is you.."

535
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:26,750
"The anklets tinked again.."

536
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:31,375
"Again it is me and it is you.."

537
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:36,541
"Live as one more is added to your age.."

538
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:41,000
"..and one more evening of the life has come.."

539
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:45,291
"Dance with joy in this gathering.."

540
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:48,916
"..as one more lamp has been lit.."

541
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
"The anklets.. - The anklets.."

542
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,291
"Tingled again.. - Tingled again.."

543
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,375
"Again it is me.. -Again it is me.."

544
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:57,541
"Again it is you.. - Again it is you.."

545
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:01,625
"The anklets tinked again.."

546
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:06,541
"Again it is me and it is you.."

547
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,958
I could not sleep all night. - Why?

548
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:15,375
Your Bhabhi's image kept floating before my eyes.

549
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,291
She is so good. - She is my mother.

550
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:24,166
Brother has reared me like a father, not a brother.

551
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,666
He never let me miss my parents.

552
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:32,041
I don't know why, my heart keeps wanting to meet Bhabhi.

553
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:34,666
Why just meet, you'll stay with her forever.

554
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:36,250
How? - As her daughter-in-law.

555
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,000
'He held her hand'

556
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:40,583
'Now he touched her cheek'

557
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:43,000
'Then he looked at me.

558
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:48,666
'He looked into her eyes. Then he got angry' - Shut up.

559
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:53,000
Hey eunuch! talk properly. - No Sumeet, you have my promise.

560
00:47:56,541 --> 00:48:01,166
'No one beat my lover with a stone'

561
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,541
Sumeet no Sumeet.

562
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:08,416
Say another word and I'll thrash you!

563
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:15,833
Guru.. Guru!

564
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:18,083
Why are you barking like a dog?

565
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:21,125
Then what else do I do? That idiot insulted me.

566
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,750
He beat me. He beat your man, Prem.

567
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:28,125
Who? - Whoever beat him, he deserves it.

568
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:29,375
Shut-up!

569
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:32,750
That eunuch, Anju's stooge.

570
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:37,875
He caught my neck. I warned him I am Prem's man.

571
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,083
Know what he said in everyone's presence?

572
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,916
He said 'bring Prem's father too'

573
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,583
How dare he! Let's go!

574
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:48,500
Brother, get three plates of omelet. Hurry up.

575
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:53,333
"Hey baby, give me a kiss.." You are still reading? Very good.

576
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:56,333
Water. Baby, you won't eat anything?

577
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:57,833
Mister. - Who called me mister?

578
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:03,208
This is gutter water. - I have brought it from the canteen drum.

579
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:04,875
And you find it gutter water?

580
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,666
I see dirt in the water.

581
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:11,375
Do one thing. Get a filter from your home tomorrow.

582
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,041
I'll give you filter water.

583
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:20,208
No, I don't want the other students to drink dirty water.

584
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:27,750
I will tell the manager and get a filter each for every student.

585
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,875
I can do anything! Understand?

586
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:39,041
He doesn't have money for tea and cigarette.

587
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,416
He will provide everyone with filter water.

588
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:45,208
I'll tell the real hoodlum and get you thrashed!

589
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,458
Brother, please come. Welcome.

590
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:49,541
Hi..

591
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,458
Tell me. - Yes? - A cold drink for me, and.. what will you have?

592
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:00,541
I am not in mood.

593
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:05,166
Sumeet! you upset yourself over every little thing.

594
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,500
You must not mind such hoodlums.

595
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:08,458
What? Am I a hoodlum?

596
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:12,541
Baby, you called me a hoodlum? You abused my character?

597
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:15,958
I am not a hoodlum. I have come here from Madras..

598
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:19,791
What behavior is this! - I'll teach you what manners are!

599
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,541
Want to get thrashed here, or outside? - Leave him!

600
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,791
Hey babe! I've not even touched you yet, why are you interfering?

601
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:27,083
Shut up!

602
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,000
What did you say? - Dog!

603
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,708
However hard you try, a dog's tail can never be straightened.

604
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:37,000
You called me a dog?

605
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,916
A dog is called a dog only.

606
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,583
You still haven't got over the habit of bullying kids.

607
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,833
Try fighting a lion!

608
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:59,208
Let's go!

609
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:02,750
You are breaking up my things!

610
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:18,583
What is going on here?

611
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:23,875
Principal, a riot! My canteen has been ruined!

612
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:28,166
Egg!!

613
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,125
There's hoodlum before me.

614
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,041
Is there someone? Hit them!

615
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,333
Principal sir!

616
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:58,958
Stop it!

617
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:05,916
Sir, he started it all. I tried hard to make him stop..

618
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,375
but he wouldn't relent.

619
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:12,125
Pervez. You are rusticated from the college.

620
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:13,541
Get out!

621
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:17,833
There is a world outside college too. I'll fix you!

622
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:19,750
I say, get out!

623
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,250
Students, you get back to your classes.

624
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,000
Go!

625
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:32,208
Sit down, eunuch! You will tire.

626
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,291
'Now he touched her cheek'

627
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,125
Speak properly!

628
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:40,375
'No one beat my lover with a stone'

629
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:43,250
Leave him Sumeet, you have my promise.

630
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:46,875
What behavior is this? - I'll fix you!

631
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:57,416
You are a coward, Sumeet! You are a weakling.

632
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,208
No.. no, I'm not a coward.

633
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:06,791
If you are not a coward, why do you allow yourself to be insulted?

634
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:08,458
I don't want to mess with them.

635
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:11,375
Don't cover up your cowardice with lies.

636
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:14,166
You have no shame, no courage.

637
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:17,000
What kind of a man are you?

638
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:21,416
One who cannot protect himself, what will he protect Anju?

639
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:24,958
Wonder what Anju must be thinking of you.

640
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,625
Maybe she is also laughing at you.

641
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,375
Shut up! Will you?

642
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:45,791
Hello. - Hello, Sumeet.

643
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:50,916
Actually, I love you.

644
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,375
Yes.. - Hello.. Hello Sumeet.

645
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:01,375
What is the matter? You didn't answer me.

646
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:07,500
I'm sleepy. - Sorry I disturbed you.

647
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:11,291
Anyway, you're coming to pick me up tomorrow morning, aren't you?

648
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:15,083
I'll be late. I'll see you in college.

649
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:18,625
Bye.. I love you. - Good night.

650
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,208
Prem, the babe is coming alone today.

651
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,375
Hello madam. - Yes mister.

652
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:42,375
Looks like you are angry with us.

653
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:45,416
Though, there is no enmity between us.

654
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:48,500
I'm not friends with you either.

655
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,666
How long does it take to make friends?

656
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,416
Only your consent is required.

657
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,916
Who do you think you are?

658
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,583
I don't think anything of myself.

659
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:03,125
But the whole college considers me crazy about you.

660
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:05,708
Mind your tongue, or else..! - Or else what?

661
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:10,791
You'll kill me? The one who your style has already killed..

662
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,250
why kill..

663
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:16,791
That is Prem's cheek, and Rani's hand.

664
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:20,583
Looks like you don't know us yet.

665
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:23,416
It is you who has not recognised me.

666
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:28,125
Looks like I will have to introduce myself now.

667
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:34,750
Yes.. - May I come in, sir?

668
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:35,416
Come in.

669
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:44,166
What do you treat college as?

670
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:49,666
Do you come here to study, or to tease girls?

671
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,625
You are mistaken, sir.

672
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:54,250
Not me, you guys are mistaken.

673
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:59,000
You must have thought even this girl will not say anything..

674
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,833
and silently suffer her humiliation.

675
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,083
But Anju is not such a girl.

676
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:09,083
Do you know who Anju is, whose daughter she is?

677
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,375
She is Dewan Pratap Singh's daughter, our college trustee.

678
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:18,625
And I cannot annoy him.

679
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:21,875
I have only two options.

680
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:26,333
See this.

681
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:32,375
Sir, this is.. - An apology. Sign it.

682
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:38,375
There is one more solution. See this.

683
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:41,708
Rusticate? - Yes.

684
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,666
You guys think what is to be done.

685
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,000
Apology?

686
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,041
Strange! he licked a girl's feet?

687
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:07,458
The principal must have threatened to rusticate him.

688
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:08,333
What else would he do?

689
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:10,125
Whatever, that Anju is a brave girl.

690
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:13,208
Atleast she is not a coward like us. Atleast she stood up to him.

691
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:16,000
Yes, but she didn't think of the consequence.

692
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:19,708
You are right. She didn't think of the consequence.

693
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:23,000
Right Pancham? - She has invited trouble.

694
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:29,333
She is no ordinary girl. If her dad comes to know..

695
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,583
he will have you arrested.

696
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,791
Are you her uncle?

697
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:39,000
Why are you taking revenge of your humiliation from me?

698
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:42,708
Don't talk too much, I'm warning you! Let's go, Pancham.

699
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,791
He's lost face, but not his pride.

700
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,541
Strange! The way you are standing silent..

701
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:59,000
like you are not thinking about our insult, but some beautiful girl

702
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,000
Where is he the college hoodlum anymore.

703
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:05,416
Seeing Anju, he has lost it.

704
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,750
Prem, I don't think you did right in apologizing.

705
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:12,083
I apologized because I didn't want that golden goose..

706
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:14,541
to slip out of our hands. - Meaning?

707
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,541
What do you mean.

708
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,875
Now that girl will get filmed on my camera..

709
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,500
and developed at Chander's studio for my interest.

710
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:24,250
Great idea!

711
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:31,625
Sure.. okay.. okay. - Excuse me.

712
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:33,416
Okay, bye.

713
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:36,458
You?

714
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:41,833
What is it? - I want Sumeet..

715
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:44,250
Why? Did he call you?

716
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:48,791
No, I just came to meet him. - Any special reason?

717
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,583
Look, whatever is happening is not right.

718
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:58,666
Sumeet is spoiling. He is ruining his career because of you.

719
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:01,375
And all this is happening because of you.

720
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,625
Because of me? Is it not his mistake at all?

721
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,625
Because he is your brother?

722
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:10,041
What is regretful is that idiot is my brother.

723
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,875
Anyway, he has realized now..

724
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:17,833
whatever he was doing was his ideocracy, his stupidity.

725
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:21,458
Stupidity? - Yes, stupidity.

726
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:22,916
You may leave.

727
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:29,125
Listen. - Yes?

728
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:34,625
You'd come to meet Sumeet? - Yes. - Did you meet him?

729
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:37,333
Where did you give me the chance?

730
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:41,250
Now this is too much! We spoke for so long, and you didn't say once..

731
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:44,375
And I thought he had sent you.

732
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,625
Anyway, he is in his room. Go and meet him.

733
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:53,833
Also ask him when he wants to get married.. to you.

734
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,833
What!

735
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:59,875
You? These tears? What happened to you?

736
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:02,416
They are tears of joy.

737
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,416
Your brother gave me loads of happiness today.

738
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,291
Brother? - Yes. Your brother is a very nice man.

739
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,708
Whose brother is he after all? Mine!

740
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:15,166
You are not as great as him. - I am greater than him.

741
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:16,416
Greater..

742
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,541
Is it? I'll accept you are great on one condition.

743
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:23,500
What condition? - If you come for the camp.

744
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,583
Anju, the camp.. You know I don't like too much noise.

745
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,625
For my sake, please!

746
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,666
For your sake?

747
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:39,750
Agreed.

748
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,083
Sumeet, you are great.

749
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:02,333
"If it is a lover of beauty or scenery.."

750
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:06,125
"This evening belongs to everyone.."

751
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:09,958
"Tell it openly.. - or with gesture.."

752
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,791
"This is the weather to rejoice.."

753
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:17,625
"If it is a lover of beauty or scenery.."

754
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:21,291
"This evening belongs to everyone.."

755
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,291
"Tell it openly.. - or with gesture.."

756
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,708
"This is the weather to rejoice.."

757
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:32,916
"The moon smiled in the open sky.."

758
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,958
"Somebody calls this as moon and some calls it as your Bindiya.."

759
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:44,333
"Beloved, see in my bindiya whose name is written in it?"

760
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:51,958
"Ask the one who is in senses, as I am knocked out.."

761
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,500
"Beloved, see in my bindiya whose name is written in it?"

762
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:07,250
"Ask the one who is in senses, as I am knocked out.."

763
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:54,916
"The thing that I couldn't tell you till now..

764
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,625
..I have to say it now.."

765
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,458
"The thing that I couldn't tell you till now

766
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:08,208
I have to say it now.."

767
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:15,541
"Tell it secretly as even I have to tell you, come closer to me.."

768
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,291
"Where will I go without you?

769
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:23,083
Your arms are like fire and my bindiya is like a spark.."

770
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:30,500
"Look these sparkles are calling out somebody's name with a smile.."

771
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:37,916
"Beloved, see in my bindiya whose name is written in it?"

772
01:04:15,958 --> 01:04:23,666
"I am in you and you are in mine, then why are we mentioned as two?"

773
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:34,541
"I am in you and you are in mine, then why are we mentioned as two?"

774
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:38,083
"Our hearts are same and our heartbeats too.."

775
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:41,916
"Then why do you make me restless?"

776
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,500
"Tell me, beloved. Tell me, dear.."

777
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:49,541
"I've already said that I can't stay without you.."

778
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:56,708
"The evening is colorful with our love.."

779
01:04:56,791 --> 01:05:03,666
"Ask the one who is in senses, as I am knocked out.."

780
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:07,833
"If it is a lover of beauty or scenery.."

781
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:11,416
"This evening belongs to everyone.."

782
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:18,666
"Tell it openly or with gesture. This is the weather to rejoice.."

783
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:22,458
"The moon smiled in the open sky.."

784
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:26,250
"Somebody calls this as moon and some calls it as your bindiya.."

785
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:33,458
"Beloved, see in my bindiya whose name is written in it?"

786
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:40,791
"Ask the one who is in senses, as I am knocked out.."

787
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:16,083
What now? - I'm looking at the moon.

788
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:23,333
It's so beautiful, isn't it? - No. I'm talking of this moon.

789
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:29,291
Come on! - Honestly, the moon in

790
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:32,750
..the sky is pale against my moon

791
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:37,291
Liar! - No, honest. I swear by Anju.

792
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:39,708
Anju's false promise?

793
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,333
What'll you lose..

794
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:47,000
..if anything happens to Anju?

795
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:52,333
For God sake, please don't say that again.

796
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:57,666
If anything happens to you, even heaven will become hell for me.

797
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:03,958
Who knows? Anyway, it is late, the warden will scream.

798
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:08,541
Let's go. - I don't feel like going to the camp.

799
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:12,291
And we are not allowed to stay out late.

800
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,625
Let's go, please!

801
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:17,250
Please.. - Okay.

802
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:21,666
On one condition. You will come after everyone goes to bed.

803
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,625
Impossible.. - Please..

804
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:29,916
What is wrong with you? - I don't know.

805
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:33,000
I don't feel like separating from you.

806
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:38,500
I feel like.. - What? - I'll tell you when you meet me.

807
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:44,750
Why don't you understand? - Will you try to come?

808
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,333
I.. - You have my promise.

809
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,916
Can't you do that much for me?

810
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:54,166
For you, I can even give my life.

811
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,166
I don't want your life.

812
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:01,791
In this moonlit night, we both will sit close to each other.

813
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:08,541
I will hold your hands and look at you for long.

814
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:14,166
You can do that much. - You have put me in a fix.

815
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:19,583
Okay, but I'll be a bit late.

816
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:26,791
Just promise me and I will spend all my life waiting for you.

817
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:30,833
My crazy lover! Okay, I am going, I'm getting late.

818
01:08:30,916 --> 01:08:33,000
Remember the promise?

819
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:35,375
Good night.

820
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:38,375
No good night, I'll be waiting for you.

821
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:40,916
I love you.. - Okay.

822
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,166
Bye.

823
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:49,041
Anju..

824
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:52,500
Hey Anju..

825
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:56,875
Honestly, the moon in the

826
01:08:57,583 --> 01:09:01,583
..sky is pale against my moon.

827
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:03,083
Liar!

828
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:10,500
For God sake, please don't say that again.

829
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:16,375
If anything happens to you, even heaven will become hell for me.

830
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:18,000
Who knows?

831
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:20,041
I don't know.

832
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:23,583
I don't feel like separating from you.

833
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:27,791
I feel like.. Anju, will you come?

834
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,541
Will you come, Anju? - Yes.

835
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:55,250
Hey crazy! Look, I have come. I kept my promise.

836
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,541
Thank you.

837
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,750
You! - Yes, me.

838
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:12,541
You think you can stick my apology on the wall..

839
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,625
and humiliate me?

840
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,291
You defeated me?

841
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:20,291
I'll show you what humiliation is.

842
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:22,083
I'll disgrace you so much..

843
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:24,875
you won't lift your head before the world.

844
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,166
Look!

845
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,250
Help me!

846
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:40,291
Rani, take.

847
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,958
Come on dude, your turn.

848
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:04,833
Sumeet. Sumeet. - Anita..

849
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:07,916
You, over here? - Where is Anju?

850
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,916
What do you mean? She came to meet you. - Me?

851
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,875
Yes, I myself saw her leave.

852
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:20,583
She didn't come here. - Then where did she go?

853
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:22,291
No!

854
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,416
Sumeet! - Anju!

855
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:29,958
Listen Sumeet!

856
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:40,541
Sumeet! - Anju!

857
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:53,958
Anju. - Anju, where are you?

858
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:01,625
Anju! Anju!

859
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:09,750
Anju.

860
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,833
Anju.

861
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:15,666
Anju.

862
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,166
Anju.

863
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,541
Anju. - Anju.

864
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,416
Anju.

865
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,791
Anju. - Anju.

866
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:32,625
Anju.

867
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:34,291
Anju. - Anju.

868
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:36,500
Anju. - Anju.

869
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:38,583
Anju. - Anju.

870
01:12:38,666 --> 01:12:40,708
Anju. - Anju.

871
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:43,166
Anju. - Anju.

872
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:57,291
Prem, she's dead! - Yes. - What now?

873
01:12:57,375 --> 01:13:00,250
Anju. - Anju.

874
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:02,000
They are coming this way.

875
01:13:02,833 --> 01:13:03,791
Take her from here.

876
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:06,916
Take her from here. Hurry up!

877
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,291
Anju. - Anju.

878
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,375
Anju. - Anju.

879
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:17,708
Prem, Pancham, they are coming here.

880
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,583
Anju. - Anju.

881
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:22,791
Remove the roll from the camera.

882
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:28,416
They are coming. - I'm removing it.

883
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:32,125
Anju. - Anju.

884
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:33,791
They are coming this way!

885
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:36,166
Let's go!

886
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,208
Anju. - Anju.

887
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:41,000
Anju. - Anju.

888
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,666
No.. no!

889
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:52,708
Anju! - Anju..

890
01:13:56,041 --> 01:14:00,375
Anju. - Anju.

891
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:04,125
Anju. - Anju.

892
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:06,875
How did this happen?

893
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:11,708
Anju. Anju.

894
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:17,666
This cannot happen, Anju!

895
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:25,875
No, Anju.. - Sumeet.

896
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:27,625
Anju.

897
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:34,416
As far as I think, it could have been a wild animal.

898
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:38,500
Even bandits visit this thick jungle.

899
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:40,500
Until a police inquiry is conducted..

900
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:42,250
it is difficult to tell the real cause of death.

901
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:45,333
We had come here to camp. What will we have to do now?

902
01:14:45,416 --> 01:14:47,958
Don't worry, I've informed the police.

903
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
They'll come here any minute.

904
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:20,750
What way is this of leaving your father's home?

905
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:27,625
What mistake did I make? What are you punishing me for?

906
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:30,541
Don't leave me and go.

907
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:35,250
I will not go against your wishes.

908
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:38,333
Mr. Dewan, have courage.

909
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:40,791
What courage, Principal?

910
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:44,208
I'm shattered.

911
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:50,583
Don't leave me and go.

912
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:56,791
Talk to me. Talk to me.

913
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:49,000
"Why should we be mentioned as two, when we share the same heart?"

914
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:53,000
"Why shouldn't we meet in such a way.."

915
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:57,083
"..that we become each others for ever."

916
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:08,666
"Why should we be mentioned as two, when we share the same heart?"

917
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:13,166
"Why shouldn't we meet in such.."

918
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,791
" ..a way that we become each others for ever."

919
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:24,375
"You take my share of nectar and give me your share of poison.."

920
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:33,000
"Why shouldn't I sacrifice everything and die as a martyr?"

921
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:38,541
"The one who loves knows the meaning.."

922
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:45,666
"The one who loves knows the meaning.."

923
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:49,583
"..of fire of passion.."

924
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:53,625
"Dear, this is the opportunity.."

925
01:17:53,708 --> 01:18:02,166
"Dear, this is the opportunity to live or to die.."

926
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:13,791
"After coming into your arms I don't feel like going anywhere else.."

927
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:17,750
"Dear, this is the opportunity.."

928
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:30,250
"..to live or to die.."

929
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:35,250
Hey, alone today? That too, until so late?

930
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:38,958
Get up, it's very late.

931
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:12,000
It is midnight, and he has not returned yet.

932
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,875
Don't worry, he will come.

933
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:18,083
How can I not worry knowing how upset he is.

934
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:21,583
I don't know why, I am very worried.

935
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:24,791
Over every small thing, you.. - Is this a small thing?

936
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:28,750
It is 12 O'clock. Why don't you go and look for him?

937
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:31,666
Where do I go and look for him at this hour?

938
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,541
All his friends, his acquaintances..

939
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:37,375
I have called them all. Have patience, he'll come.

940
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:40,333
When? That's what I've been hearing since two hours.

941
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,166
Okay, I'll keep quiet. - Go and sleep, I'll wait for him.

942
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:48,833
Rama. - Please! I said you go and sleep, I'll wait for him.

943
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:08,791
Sumeet..

944
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:13,708
Where had you gone? - You haven't gone to bed yet?

945
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:15,958
That's not the answer to my question.

946
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,041
Where were you for so long?

947
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:21,000
I was out. - Where out?

948
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:24,000
Despite knowing everyone will be worried at home?

949
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:28,250
Couldn't you have called? - So what if I didn't?

950
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:30,875
If I go out for one day, what's the big deal?

951
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:33,583
I'm not a kid anymore.

952
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:45,750
You are right.

953
01:20:47,166 --> 01:20:51,916
You are not a kid anymore.

954
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:59,625
I'd even forgotten I'm not your mother.

955
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,541
I'm just your elder brother's wife..

956
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:09,333
with whom you share no blood ties.

957
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:18,791
I am crazy. Rearing you since so many years..

958
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:23,166
I'd begun to exert my right.

959
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,958
I had forgotten my limits.

960
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,875
I..

961
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:47,750
What is the matter? Is Sumeet..

962
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:52,000
God forbid! may nothing happen to him. - Then what is it?

963
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,583
Nothing. - There is something.

964
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:58,166
You have my promise..

965
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:01,583
Why do you have to give me a promise over such a small thing?

966
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:07,333
What is the small thing? - He came late, I scolded him.

967
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:10,416
That's all? Good you scolded him.

968
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,083
I didn't do right. He is not a kid anymore.

969
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:17,666
Rama, he will always be a kid for you.

970
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,708
Why are you so upset after scolding him? Don't cry.

971
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:22,791
What is this, Rama?

972
01:22:23,458 --> 01:22:25,666
Be a good girl.

973
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:33,208
'Yes, you are right. You are not a kid anymore.'

974
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:37,208
'I'd even forgotten I'm not your mother.'

975
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:40,083
'I'm just your elder brother's wife..

976
01:22:40,166 --> 01:22:43,750
with whom you share no blood ties.'

977
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:50,458
'I am crazy. Rearing you since so many years..

978
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:55,208
I'd begun to exert my right.'

979
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:00,541
'I had forgotten my limits.'

980
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,583
'I..'

981
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:16,750
Madam, shall I wake Sumeet up? - No, let him sleep.

982
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,541
He went to bed late last night. - Alright.

983
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:20,750
Keep this vase there. - Yes.

984
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:27,500
Sister-in-law..

985
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,625
You are up? I'll get tea for you.

986
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:36,083
Forgive me, I spoke all nonsense last night.

987
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,250
Sister-in-law..

988
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:42,875
I will never trouble you again. I'll do whatever you say.

989
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:45,625
I will do everything you say. I promise.

990
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,916
You won't break the promise, will you? - No.

991
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:55,041
Atleast forgive me now. - Okay, but on one condition.

992
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:58,041
What condition? - You'll never return home late.

993
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:02,125
Agreed. - And you will go to college everyday.

994
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:09,791
That's it? Can't promise?

995
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:13,583
Okay, I'll even go to college.

996
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:24,916
Juliet had only one aim in life, and the was, Romeo.

997
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:29,541
Seeing Romeo's dead body, she started crying.

998
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:32,750
She felt like she had no desire to live.

999
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
She didn't know that the poison Romeo had consumed..

1000
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:39,000
was not poison, it was elixir.

1001
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:42,375
She took a dagger and pierced it in her stomach..

1002
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:46,625
thinking she will unite with Romeo forever.

1003
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,750
This is that immortal story of love, where a girl..

1004
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:54,250
on her lover's death, gives up her life..

1005
01:24:55,041 --> 01:25:00,500
with the hope that she will meet her lover in their next life..

1006
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:04,041
and will repeat her love story.

1007
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:07,083
But that didn't happen.

1008
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:12,291
..Destiny had decided something else.

1009
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:20,333
When Romeo recovered, he saw Juliet's dead body.

1010
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:25,333
His own state became like a living corpse.

1011
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:31,333
Eyes stoned, lips sealed, unaware of the world..

1012
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:34,000
burdened with sorrow.

1013
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:38,458
He broke down and wept over losing his beloved.

1014
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:52,083
Sumeet!

1015
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:56,250
You are crying? - No.

1016
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:59,083
Then are your eyes lying?

1017
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:02,250
These tears are not falling just like that.

1018
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:05,875
Please Sumeet, try to gather yourself.

1019
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:09,333
How much do I fight myself?

1020
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:12,541
Where do I escape from her memories?

1021
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,708
I made my heart strong and cremated her.

1022
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:22,833
But what do I do with her charming image..

1023
01:26:23,416 --> 01:26:25,250
that my eyes hold?

1024
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:30,083
Should I break my eyes?

1025
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:34,583
When did I say that, Sumeet? If Anju dwells in your eyes..

1026
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:37,833
why are you making her flow away in tears?

1027
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:43,125
Capture her image and every memory in your brain and heart.

1028
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:46,333
Make her love your strength.

1029
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:50,958
Yes Sumeet, make her love your strength.

1030
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,083
And, don't ever cry again, you have the promise of your love.

1031
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:05,958
Excuse me.

1032
01:27:14,916 --> 01:27:17,458
It's all his fault. - Pancham, speak!

1033
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:22,291
It's not my fault. - Idiot! Where did the film roll go?

1034
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:25,208
Where is the roll? - I don't know.

1035
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:29,250
If anyone finds the roll, we all will be hanged!

1036
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:31,208
And Anju's pictures..

1037
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:45,916
What is the matter?

1038
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,208
Nothing. - There is something.

1039
01:27:49,583 --> 01:27:54,791
Tell me. - Some guys were talking about some film roll.

1040
01:27:56,791 --> 01:28:03,166
Film roll. - It felt the roll was very important.

1041
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:08,000
And if anyone finds it, they could go to the gallows.

1042
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:09,625
Noose?

1043
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,333
Who would go to the gallows? - I don't know who they were.

1044
01:28:15,083 --> 01:28:18,000
But then, they took Anju's name.

1045
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:20,625
Anju? Then?

1046
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:26,666
..I tried to identify their voice, but..

1047
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:30,666
Roll? Film roll?

1048
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:34,791
Anju.

1049
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:40,958
Yes! I had found a roll. - Where?

1050
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:45,000
That night when that incident happened with Anju..

1051
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:48,708
I found it while looking for her. - Where is it?

1052
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:53,333
Hail the Lord! Tell me. - Print and develop this roll.

1053
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:59,375
It's urgent. - Okay, come back after 2 hours and take the prints.

1054
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:01,208
Thank you. - Jai Mata Di.

1055
01:29:02,666 --> 01:29:05,958
Let's go, Sumeet. He has called us after two hours.

1056
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:16,458
What are you doing! The roll will spoil.

1057
01:29:16,541 --> 01:29:18,833
I'll open it! Give me my prints, quick!

1058
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:21,125
I'll give you. - Where is my parcel?

1059
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,416
Whenever you come here, you are in a hurry.

1060
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,833
You are always fussing like this.

1061
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:27,416
I'm coming. How much will you honk?

1062
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,416
Here you are. - Is it all okay?

1063
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:30,750
Yes, everything is okay. Pay me my money.

1064
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:31,958
Here is your money. - Yes.

1065
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,625
Count it. You always crib.

1066
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:37,416
I am coming. - Prem, this is only Rs.200.

1067
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,916
You are always paying me less.

1068
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,916
You bloody rogue! The day I get a chance, I'll take revenge!

1069
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,416
I'll put you in trouble!

1070
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,500
Idiots!

1071
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:55,291
"Oh, dear God.."

1072
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,083
Anju's rape and murder?

1073
01:30:00,416 --> 01:30:01,583
Oh, my..

1074
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:11,291
Prem, you are in my control now!

1075
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:17,000
Earlier, I used to work, you took all the money.

1076
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:22,375
Now you will work, and I will take all the money.

1077
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,791
Hail the Lord!

1078
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,791
What are you looking? - Nothing it's..

1079
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,416
Nothing?

1080
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,125
It's a registry. - Registry?

1081
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:37,000
Yes, for me. I'd called for forms from some engineering college.

1082
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:38,541
Want to be an engineer? - Yes.

1083
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:39,583
Good.

1084
01:30:39,666 --> 01:30:42,041
Let your result come. The education minister is my friend.

1085
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:44,875
You will get a seat. And yes, if anyone calls, say I have left.

1086
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,166
Okay brother.

1087
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:52,541
Hello, Guru.

1088
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,791
Yes Pancham? - Did you also get those letters?

1089
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:56,958
Who could it be who must have taken the pictures?

1090
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,708
I don't know. - Let's meet at the restaurant.

1091
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:04,083
Yes, I've sent them all. Yes, they are fine.

1092
01:31:05,291 --> 01:31:06,583
Madam.

1093
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:11,291
Madam, had someone opened your reel?

1094
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:15,083
No. - Look, it is spoilt.

1095
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:17,541
Look, it's blank, there are no prints.

1096
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:20,583
How is that possible? - Whatever it is, it's before you.

1097
01:31:20,666 --> 01:31:22,625
Looks like it caught light.

1098
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:27,083
Okay. - Madam, atleast pay Rs.20 for developing.

1099
01:31:32,875 --> 01:31:34,041
Hail the Lord!

1100
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:37,250
You also got those photos? - Yes.

1101
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:40,541
Who could be blackmailing us?

1102
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:44,083
Who knows? Looks like we are going to land in a soup.

1103
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,708
Dear, I don't understand anything.

1104
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:50,000
What happened? - The roll was blank.

1105
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:54,708
Sir, what will you have?

1106
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,541
Two cold drinks. - Yes, alright.

1107
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:02,083
How many times have I told you to stop all this, but..

1108
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:06,458
Shut-up! - Okay. Now tell me, what do I do with this photo?

1109
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:11,000
Why did you have to bring this here? - What did I do?

1110
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:14,458
You are always yelling at me. - You are carrying your death.

1111
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:16,291
Do you want to go to the gallows?

1112
01:32:22,708 --> 01:32:24,000
Sumeet!

1113
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:26,333
Sumeet!

1114
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,333
What is the matter? What are you thinking?

1115
01:32:30,833 --> 01:32:32,291
There is something wrong somewhere.

1116
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,833
Wrong? What is wrong?

1117
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,416
Hide that.

1118
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:47,791
Let's leave.

1119
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:51,083
Sir, will you have tea?

1120
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:52,458
Yes, get one tea. - Alright.

1121
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:01,041
Tear it up.

1122
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:12,125
Put it in this ash tray.

1123
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:21,833
Let's go. - Okay.

1124
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,333
It is all this idiot's fault!

1125
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:36,458
You make the mistake, and I should fall in trouble?

1126
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:38,625
Why did you have to bring the photo here?

1127
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:40,000
Sir, tea.

1128
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:48,458
Waiter. - Yes?

1129
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:49,458
Get me an ash tray.

1130
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,583
Why did you have to tear the photo and put it in the ash tray?

1131
01:33:51,666 --> 01:33:53,333
You only told me to put it there.

1132
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:58,875
He called for the same ash tray.

1133
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,791
What now? - Gallows.

1134
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:51,125
The table is empty. It's not there either.

1135
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:55,541
Gone!

1136
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,291
Hello. - Son, liked the gift I sent you?

1137
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:35,625
Who are you? - Forget who I am.

1138
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:41,875
Against the gift, bring Rs.100000 and come to Hanging Garden.

1139
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:46,625
Keep the money on bench five and leave.

1140
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:48,458
Hail the Lord!

1141
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:04,500
They used to trouble me a lot. I'll make their lives miserable!

1142
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:08,000
Hey Chander.. - Hail the Lord!

1143
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:11,750
Chander, give those negatives. You troubled us enough.

1144
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:15,666
I don't have the negatives, Prem.

1145
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:19,083
I'll punch you! - You cannot compel me.

1146
01:36:19,166 --> 01:36:21,916
I'm warning you, you'll get thrashed!

1147
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,250
Pancham, tell him.

1148
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:25,166
Give it. Why do you want to die in your youth?

1149
01:36:34,208 --> 01:36:37,958
You are talking too much! - Hey, don't touch me!

1150
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,791
I'll beat you up! Give the negatives!

1151
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:43,916
Honestly, I don't have the negatives.

1152
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:51,708
Tell us quickly!

1153
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:58,541
Tell us! Why do you want to die a dog's death?

1154
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:00,375
Where are the negatives? - Speak up, old man!

1155
01:37:00,458 --> 01:37:02,333
Old man, speak up.

1156
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:16,166
You ass! what have you done! Looks like he's dead.

1157
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:27,750
No!!

1158
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:38,916
Great Sumeet! While in love, you made tall claims.

1159
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,708
Was all that an act? Was it a pretense with that innocent girl?

1160
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:47,375
Yes, it was, but not any more.

1161
01:37:49,375 --> 01:37:52,416
You have no right to love, you coward!

1162
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:56,541
How do I accept you are not a coward? Can you prove it?

1163
01:37:56,625 --> 01:38:00,916
You will have to prove it, or how will you repay this debt?

1164
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,250
The debt of love, the debt of Anju's love.

1165
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,333
Hello. - Is Prem home?

1166
01:38:22,416 --> 01:38:24,916
No, he's gone for a birthday party with friends.

1167
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,666
Where? - Diamond club.

1168
01:39:41,458 --> 01:39:48,000
"This night is juvenile as the serpent.."

1169
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:55,000
"My body is as fire and my style is like a volcano.."

1170
01:39:55,083 --> 01:40:02,208
"See the colors and see the youthfulness.."

1171
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:22,166
"This night is juvenile as the serpent.."

1172
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:29,166
"My body is as fire and my style is like a volcano.."

1173
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:36,666
"See the colors and see the youthfulness.."

1174
01:41:34,666 --> 01:41:41,625
"My body is seductive and my moves are enticing.."

1175
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:48,291
"It is a bit salty and a bit spicy.."

1176
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:58,583
"My body is seductive and my moves are enticing.."

1177
01:41:58,666 --> 01:42:05,000
"It is a bit salty and a bit spicy.."

1178
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:10,791
"Take love as well as the nectar.."

1179
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:18,166
"Take love as well as the nectar.."

1180
01:42:19,291 --> 01:42:25,458
"See the colors and see the youthfulness.."

1181
01:43:23,166 --> 01:43:30,041
"Whoever has come here has never returned back.."

1182
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:37,208
"He has subsided himself in soft arms.."

1183
01:43:40,583 --> 01:43:47,250
"Whoever has come here has never returned back.."

1184
01:43:47,458 --> 01:43:53,791
"He has subsided himself in soft arms.."

1185
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:59,833
"With the sharpness of my body.."

1186
01:44:00,666 --> 01:44:06,750
"He was killed with my love.."

1187
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:13,875
"Look what a scenery this is.."

1188
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:35,708
"This night is juvenile as the serpent.."

1189
01:44:35,791 --> 01:44:42,458
"My body is as fire and my style is like a volcano.."

1190
01:44:42,541 --> 01:44:48,916
"See the colors and see the youthfulness.."

1191
01:48:19,958 --> 01:48:21,875
No.. no!

1192
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,041
No.. no!

1193
01:48:28,708 --> 01:48:31,833
No.. no!

1194
01:48:31,916 --> 01:48:34,583
No.. no!

1195
01:48:34,666 --> 01:48:37,583
No.. no!

1196
01:48:37,666 --> 01:48:39,000
No.

1197
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:50,625
Help!

1198
01:48:50,708 --> 01:48:52,333
Help!

1199
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,583
Help. Help me!

1200
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:27,250
Help! Help me!

1201
01:50:28,333 --> 01:50:31,541
Help! Help me!

1202
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:36,625
Help! Help me!

1203
01:50:37,666 --> 01:50:41,458
Help! Help me!

1204
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:46,125
Help! Help me!

1205
01:50:46,208 --> 01:50:48,791
Help! Help me!

1206
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:54,083
Anyone there! Help! Help me!

1207
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:05,416
Prem was murdered. - Murdered?

1208
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,125
Who murdered him?

1209
01:51:07,208 --> 01:51:08,958
Was the murderer caught?

1210
01:51:10,250 --> 01:51:13,416
See the silence that spreads with our arrival.

1211
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:17,541
Why did you all fall silent? Were you bad mouthing us?

1212
01:51:17,625 --> 01:51:19,583
No, about Prem..

1213
01:51:21,625 --> 01:51:24,125
What did you say about Prem? You are insulting Prem?

1214
01:51:24,208 --> 01:51:26,291
What did you say about Prem? - The newspaper..

1215
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:28,083
What's in the newspaper? - Prem's photo.

1216
01:51:28,166 --> 01:51:30,708
Photo? What great thing did he do?

1217
01:51:32,416 --> 01:51:35,541
What is it? - Prem is dead.

1218
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:40,500
Prem is dead? - Who must have killed him?

1219
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:45,166
Lorgez. Pancham.

1220
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:48,583
You read about Prem? - We read it in the newspaper just now.

1221
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:51,500
Let's go. - I cannot believe it.

1222
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:56,041
Pancham, Rani, did you read the newspaper?

1223
01:52:14,666 --> 01:52:19,000
It's the same dress even in the photo. The same.

1224
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:22,875
Who can it be among the two?

1225
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:36,958
Rani!

1226
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,458
Have patience, sir. - Patience? I should be patient?

1227
01:52:41,708 --> 01:52:44,875
A man whose young brother is dead, he should be patient?

1228
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:47,500
My brother has been killed, Commissioner.

1229
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:51,541
And you want me to sit back and watch you making inquiries?

1230
01:52:51,625 --> 01:52:53,166
The police is doing its job.

1231
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:57,291
Just sealing exit points won't do. I want my brother's murderer!

1232
01:52:57,375 --> 01:53:00,541
We have to find him. - Then find him!

1233
01:53:00,625 --> 01:53:04,250
Just ringing telephone bells won't help you nab him.

1234
01:53:04,333 --> 01:53:09,125
The police is all around. I am doing my best.

1235
01:53:09,208 --> 01:53:11,458
He didn't leave behind any proof.

1236
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:16,166
He didn't leave behind any proof, is that also my brother's fault?

1237
01:53:16,833 --> 01:53:20,125
I will tell the minister and shake up your entire department.

1238
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:26,333
I understand your feelings, sir. I request you to stay calm.

1239
01:53:26,583 --> 01:53:29,375
We will nab that killer under any circumstances.

1240
01:53:29,458 --> 01:53:32,458
I give you 24 hours.

1241
01:53:32,708 --> 01:53:36,791
If you don't do something within 24 hours..

1242
01:53:36,958 --> 01:53:39,875
then I'll do it. - Alright sir.

1243
01:53:52,708 --> 01:53:53,958
Hello.

1244
01:53:54,416 --> 01:53:55,625
Hello.

1245
01:53:55,708 --> 01:53:58,875
Is Mr. Bharghav in? - Papa and mom have gone out.

1246
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:01,208
Who is this?

1247
01:54:02,625 --> 01:54:04,041
Very funny.

1248
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:52,208
You! - Yes, me.

1249
01:56:52,291 --> 01:56:54,666
You guys killed my Anju.

1250
01:56:54,750 --> 01:56:57,750
No. I didn't kill her. - No?

1251
01:56:59,541 --> 01:57:02,458
Why did you kill my Anju? - I didn't kill her.

1252
01:57:06,458 --> 01:57:09,833
Why did you kill my Anju? - I didn't kill her.

1253
01:57:09,916 --> 01:57:14,166
What had she done to you? - I didn't kill her.

1254
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:31,666
Answer me!

1255
01:57:45,583 --> 01:57:48,125
Help me!

1256
01:58:21,916 --> 01:58:23,958
Hello, Rani? Mona here.

1257
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,125
I'm coming to pick you up in 10 minutes.

1258
01:59:34,625 --> 01:59:35,875
Sumeet!

1259
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,833
Hello, Palton Road Police Station.

1260
02:01:09,916 --> 02:01:11,916
A girl has been murdered here. - Where?

1261
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,125
Near Central library. - We are coming.

1262
02:01:34,375 --> 02:01:36,125
Hey, move back!

1263
02:01:36,625 --> 02:01:39,500
Hey, move back!

1264
02:01:39,583 --> 02:01:41,458
Police department be damned!

1265
02:01:41,541 --> 02:01:43,208
Police department be damned!

1266
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:44,833
Police department be damned!

1267
02:01:44,916 --> 02:01:46,333
Police department be damned!

1268
02:01:46,416 --> 02:01:48,000
Police department be damned!

1269
02:01:48,041 --> 02:01:49,791
Police department be damned!

1270
02:01:49,875 --> 02:01:51,458
Police department be damned!

1271
02:01:51,541 --> 02:01:53,291
Police department be damned!

1272
02:01:53,375 --> 02:01:55,125
Police department be damned!

1273
02:01:55,208 --> 02:01:57,166
Police department be damned!

1274
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,125
Police department be damned!

1275
02:01:59,208 --> 02:02:00,750
Police department be damned!

1276
02:02:00,833 --> 02:02:02,291
Police department be damned!

1277
02:02:02,375 --> 02:02:05,833
Commissioner, is this murder also linked to the earlier murder?

1278
02:02:05,916 --> 02:02:07,041
I cannot say for sure now.

1279
02:02:07,125 --> 02:02:08,666
Police department be damned!

1280
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:10,625
Police department be damned!

1281
02:02:10,708 --> 02:02:11,916
Murders are being committed one after the other.

1282
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,208
Why hasn't the police arrested anyone yet?

1283
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:15,083
We are trying our best - Only trying?

1284
02:02:15,166 --> 02:02:16,750
Police department be damned!

1285
02:02:16,833 --> 02:02:22,458
Even the police are human. But we hope to nab the killer soon.

1286
02:02:22,875 --> 02:02:24,791
All the murders that have been committed were of students..

1287
02:02:24,875 --> 02:02:26,875
that too, of the same college. - Sir.

1288
02:02:26,958 --> 02:02:32,000
Khan, I am tired of answering the world.

1289
02:02:32,083 --> 02:02:34,041
What reply do I give? - I'm putting my best effort.

1290
02:02:34,125 --> 02:02:36,708
I don't want your effort, I want the killer.

1291
02:02:36,791 --> 02:02:37,875
That too, at the earliest.

1292
02:02:37,958 --> 02:02:39,000
Ok. - Yes Sir!

1293
02:02:39,083 --> 02:02:40,791
Police department be damned!

1294
02:02:40,875 --> 02:02:42,416
Police department be damned!

1295
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:44,125
Police department be damned!

1296
02:02:44,208 --> 02:02:46,208
Police department be damned!

1297
02:02:47,875 --> 02:02:49,583
Police department be damned!

1298
02:02:49,666 --> 02:02:51,583
Police department be damned!

1299
02:02:51,666 --> 02:02:53,166
Singh. - Yes, sir.

1300
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:55,000
Police department be damned!

1301
02:02:55,041 --> 02:02:56,500
Police department be damned!

1302
02:02:56,583 --> 02:02:57,916
Police department be damned!

1303
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,708
Only one thing stands out clearly in this case.

1304
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:03,083
What is that sir?

1305
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:12,333
The root of this chaos is buried in that college.

1306
02:03:12,416 --> 02:03:15,166
I don't have any objection, Inspector Khan.

1307
02:03:15,875 --> 02:03:19,041
Just ensure our college..

1308
02:03:19,125 --> 02:03:22,625
..reputation is not affected.

1309
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:27,541
Don't worry, sir. I take full responsibility.

1310
02:03:28,333 --> 02:03:33,750
I only want to ask a few questions from the students.

1311
02:03:33,958 --> 02:03:38,000
You are mistaken, sir. Who you think, I am not him.

1312
02:03:38,041 --> 02:03:42,333
I am a simple student. I have not committed this murder.

1313
02:03:42,416 --> 02:03:46,000
I don't know the killer, nor is he my brother.

1314
02:03:46,041 --> 02:03:49,583
Shut up. You bloody mimic.

1315
02:03:49,666 --> 02:03:52,166
If I put you in the lock-up for one night and beat you up..

1316
02:03:52,250 --> 02:03:55,583
you'll forget all your mimicry and acting. Understand!

1317
02:03:55,666 --> 02:03:58,500
I'm speaking the truth, sir. I've nothing to do with this murder.

1318
02:03:58,583 --> 02:04:04,708
Then who does? Did Prem have enmity with anyone else?

1319
02:04:04,791 --> 02:04:07,166
The whole college was enemies with Prem. But..

1320
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:11,166
But what? - Once, because of Sumeet, Prem & Parvez had a fight.

1321
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:14,125
Parvez was rusticated from college.

1322
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:17,166
While leaving, Parvez had challenged Prem..

1323
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:19,208
he will not spare him. Maybe..

1324
02:04:19,291 --> 02:04:22,166
Who is Sumeet? Does he live in this hostel?

1325
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:25,833
Sumeet is a simple guy. He doesn't live with us.

1326
02:04:26,625 --> 02:04:29,375
And what is the other name you told me? - Parvez, sir.

1327
02:04:30,833 --> 02:04:32,000
Parvez.

1328
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,875
You rascal, speak! Speak the truth!

1329
02:04:41,958 --> 02:04:47,958
Or I'll crush your bones!

1330
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,125
Speak!

1331
02:04:49,208 --> 02:04:53,125
I told you inspector, I have not committed the murder.

1332
02:04:53,208 --> 02:04:55,625
I did not commit the murder.

1333
02:04:58,458 --> 02:05:00,875
Singh. -Yes, sir!

1334
02:05:00,958 --> 02:05:02,750
Who is the other guy? - Sumeet.

1335
02:05:03,208 --> 02:05:06,291
Yes. - Prem used to trouble you a lot?

1336
02:05:06,375 --> 02:05:09,791
Why speak ill about those who are dead?

1337
02:05:09,958 --> 02:05:11,416
ARE dead?

1338
02:05:20,958 --> 02:05:25,750
You mean you are also talking of Mona and Rani along with Prem.

1339
02:05:26,583 --> 02:05:32,583
What? - That means, apart from Prem,..

1340
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:36,875
..even they troubled you.

1341
02:05:36,958 --> 02:05:38,250
What?

1342
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:46,625
And getting an opportunity, you killed each one of them.

1343
02:05:46,708 --> 02:05:50,291
Me? - Yes, you.

1344
02:05:50,375 --> 02:05:53,000
That's an allegation. It's not true.

1345
02:05:53,333 --> 02:05:58,083
Truth and lies will soon be known.

1346
02:05:58,333 --> 02:06:00,791
You are trying to trap me. - No.

1347
02:06:01,791 --> 02:06:05,375
I am telling a criminal the truth about him.

1348
02:06:05,458 --> 02:06:09,833
I have proof. And an eye witness too.

1349
02:06:12,916 --> 02:06:17,958
In the first two murders, very intelligently..

1350
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,583
..without leaving any proof, you succeeded in fooling law.

1351
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:28,583
But while committing the third murder, you slipped.

1352
02:06:28,666 --> 02:06:32,500
Sir, a woman has come who says she knows the killer.

1353
02:06:32,583 --> 02:06:34,875
Bring her here. - Please come.

1354
02:06:37,375 --> 02:06:39,125
Hello, inspector. - Hello.

1355
02:06:39,208 --> 02:06:44,708
The killer you claim to have seen, is he the one?

1356
02:07:00,625 --> 02:07:05,083
No inspector, he's not the one. - Look carefully and tell me.

1357
02:07:32,708 --> 02:07:38,250
No, he was a little fat, and tall.

1358
02:07:38,333 --> 02:07:42,416
Anyways, thank you. You may go now. - Thank you.

1359
02:07:46,208 --> 02:07:50,791
I am sorry Mr. Sumeet. You may go now.

1360
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:55,000
Thank you. - All the best.

1361
02:07:55,083 --> 02:07:57,916
Same to you. - You are welcome.

1362
02:08:07,041 --> 02:08:10,750
Thank you inspector Geeta, thanks a lot.

1363
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,125
But sir, how will this help you?

1364
02:08:13,208 --> 02:08:14,791
My plan has succeeded.

1365
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,083
I have given him a false sense of victory.

1366
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:28,791
You? So early? What is the matter?

1367
02:08:28,875 --> 02:08:30,666
You look upset.

1368
02:08:31,083 --> 02:08:33,916
Sumeet had gone to the police station today.

1369
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,416
Police station? Why?

1370
02:08:37,875 --> 02:08:39,916
In connection with investigation in the murder case.

1371
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,166
Whose murder? - The murder of college students.

1372
02:08:44,583 --> 02:08:47,500
He is not connected with those murders. He..

1373
02:08:47,583 --> 02:08:50,750
I know. But.. - Who is the inspector?

1374
02:08:50,833 --> 02:08:54,333
Wait. I met the commissioner.

1375
02:08:54,625 --> 02:08:56,000
Bhabhi.

1376
02:08:56,458 --> 02:09:00,416
Sumeet, did the police trouble you? - No.

1377
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:03,583
What is done is done. Won't anyone give me tea today?

1378
02:09:03,666 --> 02:09:07,000
Yes Bhabhi, even I'm hungry. - I'll get it.

1379
02:09:11,458 --> 02:09:14,833
Hey, what is the matter? Why are you upset?

1380
02:09:15,125 --> 02:09:18,708
Nothing brother. - Don't worry, trust me.

1381
02:09:19,333 --> 02:09:21,916
Yes. - Let's go to the table.

1382
02:09:22,666 --> 02:09:25,583
First Prem, then Mona, then Rani. Wonder whose turn it is now.

1383
02:09:25,666 --> 02:09:28,500
The students federation have also written to the Home Minister..

1384
02:09:28,583 --> 02:09:30,500
to find the killer.

1385
02:09:30,583 --> 02:09:32,125
The police is useless.

1386
02:09:32,208 --> 02:09:34,916
They still haven't been able to nab the killer.

1387
02:09:39,291 --> 02:09:42,000
Madam, Business Economics. - It's taken.

1388
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:43,458
What? It's taken?

1389
02:09:43,541 --> 02:09:45,583
Why are you getting so upset?

1390
02:09:45,916 --> 02:09:48,125
Since when did you start paying attention to studies?

1391
02:09:48,208 --> 02:09:51,750
Not me, my father. - Your father will read the book?

1392
02:09:51,833 --> 02:09:56,041
If I fail, father will throw me out of the house. I have to pass.

1393
02:09:56,125 --> 02:09:59,750
I have to secure my position. - Vandana has taken the book.

1394
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:01,166
She will return it tomorrow.

1395
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:03,250
I want the book at any cost tomorrow.

1396
02:10:03,333 --> 02:10:07,791
Okay dear, you will get it. Business economics, definitely.

1397
02:11:40,375 --> 02:11:44,000
You love to lick fingers, don't you?

1398
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:47,208
Now lick this poison.

1399
02:11:52,291 --> 02:11:55,625
Madam, madam. Business economics.

1400
02:11:56,041 --> 02:11:57,708
Keep it on the rack there.

1401
02:13:21,041 --> 02:13:23,000
Pancham, you? In college?

1402
02:13:23,041 --> 02:13:25,916
I've come to take a book. - Strange!

1403
02:13:26,041 --> 02:13:28,833
Madam, my book. - It's on the rack there.

1404
02:13:28,916 --> 02:13:30,125
Okay.

1405
02:13:35,958 --> 02:13:39,000
This book is for me. I asked for it yesterday.

1406
02:14:22,541 --> 02:14:23,958
Pancham, what happened?

1407
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,625
What happened to Pancham?

1408
02:14:26,708 --> 02:14:29,541
What happened?

1409
02:14:30,250 --> 02:14:32,875
Pancham! - What happened?

1410
02:14:37,875 --> 02:14:40,375
Sir, Sumeet is standing there.

1411
02:14:47,208 --> 02:14:50,250
I want to talk to you. Come.

1412
02:14:58,625 --> 02:15:03,500
You cannot fool the law for long now.

1413
02:15:05,041 --> 02:15:07,750
You are foolish, inspector..

1414
02:15:08,666 --> 02:15:14,875
to consider every shadow before you as that of the killer.

1415
02:15:16,416 --> 02:15:20,458
You are not a shadow, you exist.

1416
02:15:21,541 --> 02:15:27,333
Exist? Agreed I am not good at legalities..

1417
02:15:27,916 --> 02:15:31,208
but I can sure call law my property.

1418
02:15:31,625 --> 02:15:36,541
I spend my mornings and nights among the players of law.

1419
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,791
You are forgetting one important thing. Proof.

1420
02:15:44,416 --> 02:15:48,458
First find the proof, then investigate the murder.

1421
02:15:48,541 --> 02:15:54,208
The killer and the proof is as close to me as you are.

1422
02:15:54,916 --> 02:15:59,333
Assume you are the killer for me, and also the proof.

1423
02:16:00,041 --> 02:16:01,916
See this uniform?

1424
02:16:02,375 --> 02:16:05,916
I have not earned it with bribes, recommendations, buttering..

1425
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,875
..but with my intelligence and hard work.

1426
02:16:11,791 --> 02:16:16,125
And I am Khan; Inspector Khan!

1427
02:16:16,666 --> 02:16:21,750
The criminal I go after, I take him to his climax.

1428
02:16:22,416 --> 02:16:26,000
And don't forget, it is not very long now..

1429
02:16:26,083 --> 02:16:30,750
..for my hands to reach your collar!

1430
02:16:32,958 --> 02:16:34,250
Check.

1431
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:42,708
Check so soon? I'll check mate you!

1432
02:16:43,166 --> 02:16:48,041
Because I still have to eliminate a pawn yet, inspector.

1433
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:51,833
This game's last pawn.

1434
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,250
Sumeet, you are here. I've been looking for you.

1435
02:17:00,333 --> 02:17:02,166
Is everything alright? - Yes.

1436
02:17:02,250 --> 02:17:06,000
I felt like having tea, I thought we'll go together. Shall we?

1437
02:17:07,416 --> 02:17:08,625
Come. - Okay.

1438
02:17:09,458 --> 02:17:10,708
Sumeet.

1439
02:17:15,625 --> 02:17:18,416
I want to talk to you. - What is it?

1440
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:25,000
In private. - What is it that you cannot say here?

1441
02:17:25,041 --> 02:17:26,750
It is something private.

1442
02:17:27,416 --> 02:17:31,041
Anita, you go to the canteen, I'm coming.

1443
02:17:31,125 --> 02:17:33,000
Okay, but come soon.

1444
02:17:34,166 --> 02:17:35,791
Tell me, what's the matter?

1445
02:17:35,875 --> 02:17:40,625
Sumeet, I want to apologise to you. - Apologize? What for?

1446
02:17:41,166 --> 02:17:42,791
I troubled you a lot.

1447
02:17:42,875 --> 02:17:46,083
I thought I'll apologise to you before leaving.

1448
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:50,250
Before leaving? You are going somewhere?

1449
02:17:50,333 --> 02:17:54,208
Yes, forever, to Mauritius. - Mauritius?

1450
02:17:54,291 --> 02:17:56,833
Yes. I don't like it here in college now.

1451
02:17:57,208 --> 02:18:01,125
I feel lonely. My group is gone.

1452
02:18:01,625 --> 02:18:03,000
I am sorry, Sumeet.

1453
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,041
I am leaving, I have to pack..

1454
02:18:06,125 --> 02:18:07,875
and also go to Ajanta Travels in the evening.

1455
02:18:07,958 --> 02:18:10,041
Okay bye. - Okay bye.

1456
02:18:14,333 --> 02:18:16,750
Ajanta Travels

1457
02:21:02,291 --> 02:21:05,458
This wound? What will I tell brother?

1458
02:21:32,125 --> 02:21:34,666
Can't you see? You are teasing a girl?

1459
02:21:40,750 --> 02:21:42,583
I'll thrash you! I won't spare you!

1460
02:21:42,666 --> 02:21:44,500
Hey, what's going on? - Leave!

1461
02:21:44,583 --> 02:21:47,666
What is going on, here? Go, go from here.

1462
02:21:48,916 --> 02:21:54,041
Sumeet? You? What happened?

1463
02:21:54,375 --> 02:21:58,083
What happened? Come, let's go.

1464
02:21:58,250 --> 02:21:59,416
Sumeet.

1465
02:22:01,083 --> 02:22:05,500
You? - Yes, me. Where are you coming from at such a late hour?

1466
02:22:05,666 --> 02:22:10,000
I don't need to tell you that.

1467
02:22:10,041 --> 02:22:15,208
You do, Sumeet. Answer Inspector Khan.

1468
02:22:18,625 --> 02:22:21,250
I'd gone to see a film, brother. - Which film?

1469
02:22:21,833 --> 02:22:25,375
Murder. - To see Murder or commit murder?

1470
02:22:25,541 --> 02:22:27,791
I don't understand.

1471
02:22:28,625 --> 02:22:33,083
First explain to me how you got hurt.

1472
02:22:33,583 --> 02:22:36,416
I had a fight with someone in the theater. - Who?

1473
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:39,750
You don't ask names from strangers.

1474
02:22:39,833 --> 02:22:41,916
Which theater? - Shaan.

1475
02:22:43,416 --> 02:22:47,125
And this half ticket is proof.

1476
02:22:52,166 --> 02:22:57,541
If you still don't believe me..

1477
02:22:58,791 --> 02:23:02,000
Manager, Sumeet Khanna here.

1478
02:23:02,208 --> 02:23:05,250
Please speak to Inspector Khan.

1479
02:23:06,791 --> 02:23:09,041
Hello. - Manager Dwarka here.

1480
02:23:09,125 --> 02:23:10,916
Did Sumeet come to see the last show there?

1481
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,291
Yes, he did. - Did a tiff take place?

1482
02:23:15,375 --> 02:23:20,125
Yes, a small tiff, but it's okay, I managed it. - Thank you.

1483
02:23:22,375 --> 02:23:25,708
Sorry sir, I unnecessarily bothered you.

1484
02:23:25,833 --> 02:23:28,416
It's okay if it happens sometimes.

1485
02:23:28,708 --> 02:23:31,166
But if it happens always..

1486
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:34,333
Right sir, I will try to ensure this doesn't happen again.

1487
02:23:34,416 --> 02:23:36,750
Good night. - Good night.

1488
02:23:42,041 --> 02:23:45,916
It is very late. Go to bed, Sumeet.

1489
02:23:46,583 --> 02:23:48,666
Okay brother. Good night.

1490
02:24:12,166 --> 02:24:15,500
Rogers! Rogers!

1491
02:24:16,666 --> 02:24:21,750
Remember you were attacked? Someone tried to kill you.

1492
02:24:24,041 --> 02:24:27,500
Good. Did you see that man? Properly?

1493
02:24:30,250 --> 02:24:36,583
Look. Is he the man who attacked you?

1494
02:24:38,666 --> 02:24:41,375
Rogers! Rogers!

1495
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,250
Doctor.

1496
02:24:46,625 --> 02:24:47,875
Oh my God.

1497
02:24:52,791 --> 02:24:55,500
I am sorry. He is no more. - What?

1498
02:24:55,583 --> 02:24:56,833
Yes.

1499
02:24:57,875 --> 02:24:59,458
Oh god.

1500
02:25:03,208 --> 02:25:06,583
Doctor, can you do me a favor? - Yes.

1501
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:12,708
The news of Lorgez's death should not leak out of this room.

1502
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:19,250
Every ward boy, doctor, nurse connected to this ward..

1503
02:25:19,333 --> 02:25:22,458
has to be told that Lorgez is still not out of danger.

1504
02:25:23,041 --> 02:25:28,500
With the operation, there are chances of his survival.

1505
02:25:30,375 --> 02:25:32,083
Good. - Good?

1506
02:25:32,750 --> 02:25:34,625
What good news is in the paper?

1507
02:25:34,708 --> 02:25:36,708
Papers always carry news that's bad or of destruction.

1508
02:25:36,791 --> 02:25:38,625
It's about Lorgez Anthony.

1509
02:25:38,708 --> 02:25:42,416
They say he can be saved after an operation.

1510
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:43,916
That's very good news.

1511
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,541
Lorgez is the only eye witness, whose survival..

1512
02:25:47,625 --> 02:25:49,750
will ensure the arrest of the killer.

1513
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,875
Hope he survives.

1514
02:25:53,166 --> 02:25:54,416
Take.

1515
02:26:13,541 --> 02:26:15,583
Sir, Rs.30.

1516
02:26:16,041 --> 02:26:19,791
You were right, sir. He has come disguised as a doctor.

1517
02:26:19,875 --> 02:26:21,250
Let him come.

1518
02:26:35,083 --> 02:26:37,250
Special ward. This is the one.

1519
02:27:19,333 --> 02:27:21,416
Welcome. Welcome.

1520
02:27:33,333 --> 02:27:37,666
The reward I give you for your obsession..

1521
02:27:37,750 --> 02:27:42,333
will be a lesson not only for you..

1522
02:27:42,416 --> 02:27:47,583
..but for your generations to come.

1523
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:50,000
Drop the knife.

1524
02:27:52,250 --> 02:27:55,583
You fool! You came to kill a corpse?

1525
02:27:59,125 --> 02:28:00,625
Now come on.

1526
02:28:02,333 --> 02:28:08,291
You bloody. You bloody criminal. I'll get you. I'll get you!

1527
02:28:21,291 --> 02:28:22,583
Careful.

1528
02:28:23,375 --> 02:28:25,166
Who is taking the ambulance?

1529
02:28:25,625 --> 02:28:27,458
Catch him.

1530
02:30:48,208 --> 02:30:49,500
Sumeet, stop!

1531
02:31:06,541 --> 02:31:10,333
What I regret is that Inspector's Khan's bullet..

1532
02:31:10,416 --> 02:31:15,041
..instead of hitting my leg, why didn't it hit my chest.

1533
02:31:16,041 --> 02:31:18,125
Atleast I would die.

1534
02:31:18,333 --> 02:31:23,166
The chance to meet Anju was also snatched from me.

1535
02:31:25,625 --> 02:31:28,833
If truth is confession of crime..

1536
02:31:29,333 --> 02:31:32,875
the law has every right to punish.

1537
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,666
But behind this truth, let is also think..

1538
02:31:37,750 --> 02:31:40,083
..of human relations and the pain..

1539
02:31:40,166 --> 02:31:45,333
that compelled a simple and innocent man to do this.

1540
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:51,333
I want to present a picture of this bitter truth to the court..

1541
02:31:51,416 --> 02:31:57,416
..seeing which, any man in the world can lose his head.

1542
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:20,333
This picture shows the helplessness & defenselessness of a girl.

1543
02:32:20,583 --> 02:32:25,083
But it does not show the painful screams of that helpless girl.

1544
02:32:25,250 --> 02:32:30,333
It shows her defenselessness, but no way of escape.

1545
02:32:30,416 --> 02:32:34,083
Every man's heart will shudder to see this picture.

1546
02:32:34,291 --> 02:32:37,500
This picture is asking for justice, Your Honor.

1547
02:32:37,583 --> 02:32:41,625
Sumeet committed these crimes, helpless at the hands of his heart.

1548
02:32:42,833 --> 02:32:45,875
He weighed justice and injustice in the scales of emotions.

1549
02:32:45,958 --> 02:32:49,333
Had he weighed it in the scales of law..

1550
02:32:49,416 --> 02:32:51,833
..he would not be standing helpless here in the box.

1551
02:32:52,041 --> 02:32:55,541
That's all, your honor. That's all.

1552
02:33:07,291 --> 02:33:10,083
After due consideration of the case..

1553
02:33:10,166 --> 02:33:12,625
..the court has reached the conclusion..

1554
02:33:12,708 --> 02:33:17,500
..that these five murders were pre-planned.

1555
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:22,000
So the court declares Sumeet Khanna guilty.

1556
02:33:22,375 --> 02:33:27,000
But considering his mental state, and his young age..

1557
02:33:27,041 --> 02:33:31,250
the court sentences him to life imprisonment.

1558
02:33:48,833 --> 02:33:51,125
The boy is young too.

1559
02:34:07,041 --> 02:34:08,458
Sumeet.

1560
02:34:10,666 --> 02:34:11,916
Sumeet.

1561
02:34:12,833 --> 02:34:15,916
Don't cry, Bhabhi.

1562
02:34:16,750 --> 02:34:23,041
My Bhabhi cannot be so weak. - Forgive me. I could not..

1563
02:34:23,125 --> 02:34:29,250
No Bhabhi, you gave me life instead of the gallows.

1564
02:34:29,958 --> 02:34:32,083
You have given me new life, Bhabhi.

1565
02:34:32,166 --> 02:34:33,833
Excuse me, Mrs. Khanna.

1566
02:34:33,916 --> 02:34:35,000
Please.

1567
02:34:35,041 --> 02:34:36,291
