1
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:15,280
"Hari! Hari!"

2
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,180
'This is Bhagyanagaram (HYDERABAD).'

3
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,266
'A place filled with
stories and poetry.'

4
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:29,341
'Once it was ruled by grand kings..'

5
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,937
'..and later saw
rebellions of poor people.'

6
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,756
'You can see mansions
of rich people..'

7
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,811
'..and also garbage dumpsters
where beggars live.'

8
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,484
'The stones here still
echo the heartbeats of Nawabs..'

9
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,944
'..who built Bhagyanagaram
to win the love of Bhagyamati.'

10
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:55,290
'Here, you hear loves stories
not just at Charminar..'

11
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,587
'..but also at garbage dumps.'

12
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:01,114
'You will see hearts filled
with love everywhere.'

13
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:05,205
'This city shines
like a bright light..'

14
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:08,523
'..because of the dumpsters
that are in the corner.'

15
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:12,223
'If those stories start to
move and the hearts start to beat..'

16
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:14,510
'..if those love
stories come to life..'

17
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,595
'..and rebel if those dumpsters
swell like an ocean..'

18
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:24,729
..and come upon the city
like a great storm why say it?'

19
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,496
'Let's see it for ourselves.'

20
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,289
O Lord, everything is in your hands.
Please guide me.

21
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:41,473
- Auto! Stop!
- Where to?

22
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,821
- MGBS.
- Okay, get in.

23
00:03:57,183 --> 00:04:00,076
'The number you are trying
to call is switched off.'

24
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:13,947
Stop here.

25
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:17,768
Here you go.

26
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:42,013
Hello, doctor!

27
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,480
- Hi!
- I'm the CI of this area.

28
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,026
- How is she?
- Her condition is very critical.

29
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:48,494
She's been stabbed
once in the intestines..

30
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:50,677
..and twice besides kidneys.
She has lost a lot of blood.

31
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:52,512
So, when can I question her?

32
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:53,766
I'll inform you as soon
as she gains consciousness.

33
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:55,621
Okay, doctor. Thank you.

34
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:57,456
- Sir, the girl's bag.
- Open it.

35
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,998
Her phone.

36
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,605
- Did you inform her relatives?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:07,012
What happened, dear?
Oh God! Shirisha! Oh Mother!

38
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,458
Didn't you find any
clues at the crime scene?

39
00:06:08,538 --> 00:06:09,567
They are still searching, sir.

40
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,818
What happened to my daughter?

41
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:15,221
- What happened to her?
- Is she your daughter?

42
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,343
Yes, she's my daughter.
She's my daughter.

43
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:18,393
Who is the guy beside her?

44
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:22,657
He's the one who ruined
her life in the name of love.

45
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:26,735
- Where does he live? - He works in
a used things shop beside our colony.

46
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,596
He came home to ask
for her hand in marriage.

47
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:32,527
But I refused.
I'm sure he did this to exact revenge.

48
00:06:32,607 --> 00:06:33,541
- Ramesh!
- Sir!

49
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,670
Bring him to the station.

50
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,485
Sir, they are here!

51
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,302
Hey, get up!

52
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,144
- Oh no! The police!
- Come on, get up!

53
00:06:44,883 --> 00:06:46,550
Who is Hari? Where is he?

54
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:48,725
Come on, answer me!

55
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:51,455
- Where do you think you are going?
- Sir, I don't know anything.

56
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:53,001
We are telling truth.

57
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:54,530
Hey, stop!

58
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,440
- Why is this man after me?
- Stop! I said stop!

59
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,880
- I don't know anything, sir.
- You fat fellow! Stop.

60
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:03,660
I didn't eat anything there.
Please leave me. Sir! Sir!

61
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,051
- Stop right there!
- Oh, Mother!

62
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:08,343
- Why are you running?
- I'm scared of the police.

63
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:10,011
- Who is Hari?
- Definitely not me.

64
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:12,824
- Where is he? Answer me!
- I don't know. Sir, I don't know.

65
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:15,687
Hari escaped, sir.
I'm sure he left the city by now.

66
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,023
Okay, come back to station.

67
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:26,664
What is all that blood on your shirt?
Did you stab someone?

68
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,614
I didn't sleep all night.
The CI gives me too much work.

69
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:49,015
What is all this blood?

70
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:51,274
Why is blood flowing
from the bathroom?

71
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:53,752
Who is inside? Who is there?

72
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,802
Who is it?

73
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:02,798
Open the door!

74
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:04,629
Who are you?

75
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:07,501
What is all this blood?
What are you doing?

76
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,687
Answer me! Answer me!

77
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:10,298
Oh, God!

78
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,684
Stop! Stop!

79
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:31,312
- I don't know, sir! Oh, God!
- Tell me.

80
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,786
- I don't know, sir!
- Answer me! Come on, speak up!

81
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:35,580
This generation's
youths are so twisted.

82
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,159
They chase girls in the name of love..

83
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,364
..and if the girls refuse,
they stab them to death..

84
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,743
..or pour acid on their faces.
This is the trend now.

85
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:43,006
Nobody is afraid of Nirbhaya Law too.

86
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,764
It is a waste of time
to take these guys for trial.

87
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,723
We should kill them on the spot.

88
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:48,669
You know how our CI works.

89
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:50,807
He uses his revolver even
for minor pickpocket cases.

90
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:52,438
He won't let that guy get
away with such a big offense.

91
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:57,293
- Ramesh!
- Yes, sir!

92
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:58,732
- Did you bring him in?
- Yes, sir.

93
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,459
- Good morning, sir!
- Bring him to me.

94
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:07,732
Come on, get up.

95
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:15,144
- What is your name?
- Hari Krishna, sir.

96
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:16,157
Where do you work?

97
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,293
In the scrap shop,
beside the main road.

98
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,836
- How long have you been working there?
- Since one year.

99
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,340
- Where are you from?
- Chodavaram.

100
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,543
- Where is that?
- Near Srikakulam.

101
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:26,295
Why did you come here to Hyderabad?

102
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,273
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

103
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,476
Tell me the truth.

104
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:36,089
My parents died when
I was two years old.

105
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,178
I didn't have any relatives
or any work to feed myself.

106
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,847
'I was all alone.'

107
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,121
'I came to the city looking for work.'

108
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,996
'Since this city has welcomed
and fed many people..'

109
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:51,888
'..I came here with the
hope of finding some work.'

110
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:06,086
Bless my scrap shop, Lord.

111
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:12,213
Who are you?

112
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:14,306
Why are you sleeping
in front of my shop?

113
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,942
Get up! Every homeless
man comes and sleeps here..

114
00:10:17,022 --> 00:10:18,952
..as if there is no
other place in the street.

115
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:20,409
Wake up. Come on.

116
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:24,519
Who are you?

117
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:29,350
Who are they?

118
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:32,043
What is this?

119
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:35,554
Rascals!

120
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:39,827
Who are you? Let me go!

121
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:43,822
You can't get away!
Who are you? Stop it!

122
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:46,253
Last night they were trying
to run away with some cans.

123
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,748
I found them suspicious,
so I caught them.

124
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:48,981
Rascals!

125
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,456
When I started losing
things from the shop..

126
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,042
..I thought maybe my
workers are stealing stuff..

127
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:55,889
..but you are the real thieves.
Rascals, how dare you!

128
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,538
Weren't you afraid to catch them?

129
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,150
I was. That's why I tied them up.

130
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,962
God showed me the way to go..

131
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,612
..and Mother Earth showed
me the path to walk on.

132
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:08,338
You look like an innocent
guy and you are from my village.

133
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,536
'You can work for me.
Let me introduce to the other boys.'

134
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:12,763
'Okay.'

135
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,831
My parents sent me
to the city thinking that..

136
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,400
..I'll waste my life
if I stay in the village.

137
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,625
But I'm really wasting
my life sitting in this scrap.

138
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:24,624
My father called me the other day.

139
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:27,434
He asked me what I'm doing these days.
I said scrap.

140
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:29,415
He said I will definitely
reach great heights.

141
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:33,550
If he finds out what scrap is,
he will definitely go up.

142
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,359
Why didn't our boss come yet?

143
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:39,571
If he comes,
I'll sell him off with this scrap.

144
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:42,105
He buys scrap, who will buy him?

145
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,460
What is this meeting
early in the morning?

146
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,927
- Here he comes.
- Did I hear you talking about buying?

147
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,690
This young man is from my village.
From Chodavaram.

148
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,647
He has nobody here.
He will stay with you from today.

149
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:56,154
Take care of him. Okay?

150
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:58,216
You don't pay us enough
and now you hired another guy.

151
00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:00,740
- What are you murmuring?
- Nothing.

152
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,671
These rascals are cunning. Be careful.

153
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:06,313
'Everyone thinks that people
in the cities are like robots.'

154
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,967
'But I found people with good hearts.'

155
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:13,607
I found friends who will
risk their lives for me.'

156
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:20,242
"Rattalu!
Rattalu! When I see you.."

157
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,185
Move aside.

158
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:25,218
Hey, you move aside. Move aside.

159
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,297
One can is not enough for you,
you'll need at least 6.

160
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:30,382
Get lost, Skinny!

161
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:32,484
Why are they getting ready?

162
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:34,471
We'll get our salaries today.

163
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:37,680
- We live in this dump,
so let's go out today. - Let's go.

164
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,212
We shared our joys,
sorrows, laughter and tears.

165
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,254
We were waiting for you.

166
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:47,123
If you give us our salaries,
we'll go out and have fun.

167
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:53,046
Hari, here you go.

168
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:54,727
Your salary.

169
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,214
Hey, get up. What are you doing?

170
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,061
This is not just salary for me.

171
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:02,357
You've given a new life to an orphan.

172
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:04,977
That's how I started
working at the scrap shop.

173
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:07,584
My daughter's life is ruined.
You will rot in hell.

174
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,195
- Don't talk too much.
- I curse you.

175
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:10,397
What is going on there? Go check.

176
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:11,351
Rascals!

177
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:15,931
- Stop fighting. Stop it.
- How could he do that to my daughter?

178
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,527
Venkat! What is going on there?

179
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:18,594
Send them away.

180
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:22,700
Sir, these people ruined
my daughter's life.

181
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,900
Send that rascal out.

182
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,829
- I'll kill him with my own hands.
- Send them away.

183
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:29,869
- Go away. Come on, leave.
- Sir! Sir!

184
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:31,701
Sir, that informer
is eating my brains.

185
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:32,713
Bring him out.

186
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:34,806
Hey, come out.

187
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,720
- What's your name?
- Sippy!

188
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,629
Sippy? What kind of a name is that?

189
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,263
My full name is Singareni Picchaiah.

190
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,257
I shortened it to Sippy,
since it sounds more stylish.

191
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,618
- Look, Singareni Picchaiah..
- Sippy, sir. Sippy!

192
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:48,125
Tell me where Yerranna's gang is.

193
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:50,608
- What gang, sir?
- Don't act innocent before me.

194
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:53,190
I know that you are an
informer to Yerranna's gang.

195
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,083
I don't even know my village well.

196
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:57,709
How can I be an informer
to a gang hiding in a forest?

197
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:59,227
- You!
- Sir!

198
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:00,341
Why are you hitting me, sir?

199
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:01,650
It is against the rules.

200
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,211
- Rules? You will tell me rules?
- Please stop, sir.

201
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,287
I don't have anything
to do with Yerranna's gang.

202
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,338
Please sir, believe me.

203
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:10,048
Then where were you going last night?

204
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:12,472
I was going to my second mistress
without my wife's knowledge.

205
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,416
- You!
- Sir!

206
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:14,944
You mean you have
a first mistress too?

207
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:17,375
Of course I do,
that's why I said second mistress.

208
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:18,963
- Sir!
- Answer me.

209
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:23,162
Your men found me and
brought me here at gunpoint.

210
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,392
- Sir!
- What's the status of that case?

211
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:27,767
We are investigating it, sir.

212
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,187
Lock him up.

213
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:31,954
Come on, get inside.

214
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:52,871
Who is the girl beside you?

215
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,005
Cat got your tongue?

216
00:14:58,443 --> 00:14:59,913
Answer me!

217
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:04,054
- Is she your girlfriend?
- Who is that girl?

218
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:07,996
Nowadays,
every guy has a girlfriend. Tell me.

219
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:10,751
She is Shirisha, sir.

220
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,817
The girl I fell in love with.

221
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:15,350
My life was going well.

222
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,543
One day a girl entered
my life like a gift from God.

223
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:21,732
Hey!

224
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:30,164
What is going on there?
What's with those balloons?

225
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:32,234
Maybe they are celebrating love.

226
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,173
Let's check it out.

227
00:15:43,324 --> 00:15:45,553
Happy Valentine's Day!

228
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,510
Happy Valentine's Day!

229
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,353
I feel that girl was born for me.

230
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:53,683
- For you?
- Maybe.

231
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:55,401
But who says she grew up for you?

232
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:57,725
Emotionless fool!
Can't you say anything good?

233
00:15:57,805 --> 00:16:01,036
The light in her eyes chased
away the darkness in my life.

234
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:04,159
Her smiles pricked my heart
like thorns on a rose bush.

235
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,004
- Hello!
- Yes?

236
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:08,361
Are you waiting for your girlfriend?

237
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,278
She'll definitely come.
There is joy in waiting.

238
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,278
Happy Valentine's Day!

239
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:20,323
Thank you. Same to you.

240
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,943
Happy Valentine's Day!

241
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:01,538
Stop blabbering.
Drink the beer and go to sleep.

242
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,213
'Happy Valentine's Day!'

243
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,520
How long will you look at that flower?

244
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,653
Your looks have withered it.

245
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:17,687
She gave flowers to everyone
in the park, not just you.

246
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:19,956
Go to sleep.
There's nothing special about it.

247
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:24,210
Don't harass the blanket
with all that rolling.

248
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:27,327
Hold this. Now watch me.

249
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,276
- Don't step on me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

250
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,128
Hari, get up.

251
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:44,246
What happened to you?
Why are you stumbling?

252
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:45,576
That's me.

253
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:47,413
I'm a normal man before drinking..

254
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:49,763
..but after drinking
I become an invincible man.

255
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:54,624
Forget about me.
Why aren't you sleeping?

256
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:55,953
I'm thinking of the flower.

257
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,980
Which flower? I know many florists.

258
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,092
I'll bring you whoever you want.

259
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:05,045
No, I'm thinking of the
flower we saw in the park today.

260
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,525
Oh, that girl. I got it.

261
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:12,419
When a girl looks deeply
into a man's eyes, he loses it.

262
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:13,576
Loses what?

263
00:18:13,656 --> 00:18:16,051
His heart.
Don't misunderstand my words.

264
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:19,705
Guys who sell beer bottles
can't afford to like girls in BMWs.

265
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:22,039
We proudly use the
English word scrap..

266
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,295
..but nobody who knows
what it means will respect us.

267
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,317
Take my advice and forget..

268
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:30,712
Looks like you are going to puke.
Go away.

269
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:35,553
Yes, come here. Get under the blanket.

270
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:38,916
Hey, stop!

271
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:41,809
If you apply breaks like that,
your auto will fly off the road.

272
00:18:42,095 --> 00:18:43,855
What's that board on the gate?

273
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:45,669
Beware of dogs.

274
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:49,040
Everybody keeps this board
even if they don't have dogs.

275
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:50,974
Throw it away.

276
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:54,744
- Good morning, grandma.
- Good morning! How are you, dear?

277
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,513
I'm good.

278
00:18:58,132 --> 00:18:59,432
Here you go.

279
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:01,868
Listen.

280
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:05,362
- Open the gate! Open the gate!
- Open the gate! Open the gate!

281
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:06,800
- Open the gate! Come on.
- Hey, open it. Open it.

282
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,898
Who is it?

283
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,041
- Who are you?
- We want the security guard.

284
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:11,220
I'm the security guard.

285
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,720
- We want to meet the security guard
of this house. - Yes, that's me.

286
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,569
They called us to collect
the scrap from this house.

287
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,163
Oh. Come with me.

288
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:19,550
Not that gate, come this way.

289
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,319
- He won't fit in that gate.
- We'll go this way.

290
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:24,652
- Okay, go on.
- Maybe there are dogs here. Be careful.

291
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:26,728
Laxmi, wipe that properly.

292
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:28,442
You take salary but don't do the work.

293
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:34,384
I'm sure they have a lot of scrap.

294
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,071
You come here, and you go there.

295
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:38,085
Who is she? The landlady?

296
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:39,427
No, she's a servant.

297
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:41,564
- The landlord's sons live in America.
- Laxmi, clean that.

298
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:43,834
She takes care of the old couple.

299
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,308
I've never seen a servant
with so much authority.

300
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:47,446
She's acting like the
mistress of the house.

301
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:49,613
- We shouldn't have removed that board.
- Why?

302
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:51,960
- She's like a dog.
- Hey! Who are you?

303
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,654
- They came for scrap.
- Okay. Okay.

304
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,255
It's in the backyard.
Go count everything.

305
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:56,569
I'll come and check in some time.

306
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:57,811
Come with me.

307
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:03,115
- Count them correctly.
- Wow, so many beer bottles.

308
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:05,577
I'm sure that woman
drank all this beer.

309
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:08,041
If I collect all these drops,
I'll be sorted for tonight.

310
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:21,613
Oh God! You broke it.

311
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,133
I like the view.

312
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,166
She's my flower from the park.

313
00:20:28,904 --> 00:20:30,586
- Are you sure it's your girl?
- Very sure.

314
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,275
Then come with me. Come on.

315
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:33,946
- Let's go.
- Okay. Let's go.

316
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,655
- What?
- Shut up!

317
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,978
How dare you call me with a whistle?

318
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:45,250
You rascal! You are dead.

319
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,496
Shut up!

320
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,335
- The girl upstairs is going to be
my friend's girlfriend. - Yeah!

321
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,206
Understood?

322
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:54,391
He's in love with
your boss's daughter.

323
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:56,306
He'll become his son-in-law very soon.

324
00:20:56,386 --> 00:21:01,293
So be respectful.
Go bring juice for us. Apple juice.

325
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:03,182
- What?
- Mom!

326
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:13,857
Mom, I'm leaving.

327
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:17,484
I finished cleaning the first
floor and ground floor. Okay? Bye.

328
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:18,797
Okay, dear.

329
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:27,349
She addresses her servant as mom.
She's so good.

330
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:29,694
She calls me mom because I'm her mom.

331
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,311
You are her mother?

332
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,638
Close the doors!

333
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:41,083
- This is why they said beware of dogs!
- Brothers! Come on!

334
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:43,245
Everyone come fast.

335
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:47,204
- These rascals are getting away! Stop!
- She's closing in on us! Run!

336
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:50,299
Fatso, run faster!

337
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,551
You'll get caught! Run!

338
00:21:57,131 --> 00:22:01,142
You can't escape! You are dead!

339
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:02,885
- Stop! Stop!
- Run! Run!

340
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:08,706
Please stop. Slow down.

341
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:12,067
- Otherwise, I'll lose them all.
- What?

342
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,209
- Change.
- You fool!

343
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:16,846
- Stop right there!
- Oh, God!

344
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:21,417
Rascals! Do you think
you can get away from me?

345
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:22,901
Wait.

346
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:25,027
- Please forgive us just this once!
- Stop!

347
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:26,330
Oh God, we are so dead!

348
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,049
Run, go that way! Don't get caught!

349
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:30,714
I caught you!

350
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:33,843
Let me go. Let me go.

351
00:22:34,346 --> 00:22:36,301
- Bring the chili powder.
- Chili powder?

352
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:38,153
We are dead, Yadigiri.

353
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:45,189
Oh God! Please let me go!
I beg of you! Let me go!

354
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:50,956
No, sister! Please, no, it burns!

355
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,620
Please, no! It will burn me!

356
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,229
- The girl upstairs is going to be your
girlfriend? - Oh, God! No, please!

357
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,052
- Rub the chili powder on him.
- No, please! Stop!

358
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:01,613
Please. Please don't do this.

359
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:04,290
Please don't do this.

360
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:10,325
Oh God!

361
00:23:13,616 --> 00:23:15,328
Hey!

362
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:19,194
God! My skin is burning.

363
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,498
My skin is burning.

364
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,333
My skin is on fire.

365
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,940
Oh, God! I can't bear this anymore.

366
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:29,506
It's like I'm sitting on fire.

367
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:32,282
Nothing is happening to you?

368
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,106
How can you be so cool?

369
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:40,258
I'm not cool.
There's a cooler behind me.

370
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:41,737
Oh!

371
00:23:41,817 --> 00:23:43,382
My body is on fire.

372
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:45,347
Oh, there's a cooler behind you.

373
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:48,569
I used to cry if the
food is a little spicy.

374
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:53,787
And that woman rubbed
chili powder on my whole body.

375
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,432
I'm burning up.

376
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:58,167
Forget love. Forget that girl.

377
00:23:58,247 --> 00:24:01,327
Why will I forget my
girl for such a small problem?

378
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:04,368
Is this a small problem for you?

379
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:07,859
She almost killed us.

380
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:10,299
I don't care.
I thought she was way out of my range.

381
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:11,916
But now I know she's
well within my range.

382
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:13,442
I've decided that I'll love her.

383
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:14,631
- What?
- What?

384
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:17,388
- What? - I've decided that
I'll lover her, Yadigiri.

385
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:21,476
"You are superb, bro.
I liked you at first sight."

386
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:25,176
"What did love do to me, O Narayana?"

387
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:29,135
"His smile is killer.
His smile is heartbreaking."

388
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:33,350
"I've decided, Yadigiri.
I've given my heart to that girl."

389
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:48,162
"I'm lost, Yadigiri.
I'm lost in her love."

390
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:55,697
"I'm lost, Yadigiri.
I'm lost in her love."

391
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:59,826
"Some call it love
and some call it like."

392
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:03,664
"Whatever it is,
I've lost my heart to this girl."

393
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,769
"Yadigiri!"

394
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,611
"Yadigiri!"

395
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:14,492
"My dear Yadigiri!
"What is this new sensation?"

396
00:25:14,572 --> 00:25:16,536
"My dear Yadigiri!

397
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:22,832
"My dear Yadigiri!
What is this new sensation?"

398
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:26,352
"What did love do to me, O Narayana?"

399
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:30,578
"What did love do to me, O Narayana?"

400
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,180
"Kohli's batting cannot
give me this high."

401
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,108
"A date with Sunny Leone
cannot give me this high."

402
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:04,536
"Offers from Jio cannot
give me this high."

403
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,578
"Swiss Bank balance
can't give me this high."

404
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:12,492
"Her love gives me the real high."

405
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:16,613
"What will I do without it?"

406
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:19,748
"Yadigiri!"

407
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,610
"Yadigiri!"

408
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:27,433
"My dear Yadigiri!
What is this new sensation?"

409
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:29,412
"Yadigiri!"

410
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:35,153
"My dear Yadigiri!
What is this new sensation?"

411
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:39,367
"What did love do to me, O Narayana?"

412
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:43,475
"What did love do to me, O Narayana?"

413
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,914
"Owning Taj Mahal cannot
give me this high."

414
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:21,810
"Drugs cannot give me this high."

415
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,301
"Ambani's wealth cannot
give me this high."

416
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:29,173
"A selfie with Modi
can't give me this high."

417
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:33,123
"Her love gives me the real high."

418
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:36,971
"I'll go crazy if I lose her."

419
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:40,425
"Yadigiri!"

420
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:42,309
"Yadigiri!"

421
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:48,104
"My dear Yadigiri!
What is this new sensation?"

422
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,834
"Yadigiri!"

423
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:55,582
"Yadigiri! My dear Yadigiri!
What is this new sensation?"

424
00:27:55,662 --> 00:27:59,284
"What did love do to me, O Narayana?"

425
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:05,059
I got all her details.
Her name is Shirisha.

426
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:07,636
She's studying Intermediate
2nd year in a government college.

427
00:28:07,716 --> 00:28:10,575
She crosses our shop
when she goes to college.

428
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,601
Some guys are already after her.

429
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,460
- That's the matter, Hari.
- Light House!

430
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,433
- What? - You grew up like a palm tree
but you don't have brains.

431
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:19,424
You should find out the real details.

432
00:28:19,504 --> 00:28:21,317
She has a monster mother.

433
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:24,309
She has two uncles who are goons.
Do you know that?

434
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:26,254
The other day you escaped
the chili powder attack.

435
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:27,504
Or else you would've known.

436
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:30,031
Don't be scared.
Just give me three days time.

437
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:31,522
I'll make her fall for me.

438
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:33,704
- Is that a bet?
- Yes. What do you want?

439
00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:35,897
10 beers and 5 'Biryanis'
with boneless chicken.

440
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:37,986
If he mother finds out,
she'll break all our bones.

441
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:40,657
Light House!
Your mechanic shed will be our den.

442
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:51,671
Sir, tea! Yes. Your tea, sir.

443
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:53,578
Now I have to wash these cups.

444
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,563
He's doing this to impress that girl.

445
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:00,984
Hari, girls like cricket, not caroms.

446
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:04,355
Stop your nonsense.
Tell me if she's coming.

447
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:07,269
Tell me if her uncles are with her.

448
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,345
Okay. First order some tea.

449
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:18,608
Look at his style of
ordering four cups of tea.

450
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:21,302
Who are they?
Why are they sitting before my stall?

451
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:23,116
Do you think they are
flirting with my wife?

452
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:26,056
No way. They don't
stand a chance with her.

453
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:27,014
My darling!

454
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:30,137
I'll pour this decoction on you,
you rascal. Good riddance.

455
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:31,711
- Go, give them tea.
- Give them tea.

456
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,799
Here you go. Hot tea.

457
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:37,745
Here you go. Here you go.

458
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:39,578
Why did you choose to sit here?

459
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:42,084
I have to sit here to win the bet.

460
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:43,932
Impressing girls is not an easy feat.

461
00:29:44,012 --> 00:29:45,203
Okay, give me money.

462
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,905
What money? Put it on our account.

463
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,301
- Account? - He'll clear the bills
after the girl falls for him.

464
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:52,336
- What if she doesn't?
- Her uncles will clear the bills. Go.

465
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:56,072
They don't have money to buy
tea but they want girlfriends. Idiots!

466
00:29:56,706 --> 00:29:58,154
Did they give money?

467
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:00,422
No, they asked me to
put it on their account.

468
00:30:00,502 --> 00:30:02,503
- Okay then, I'll put it
on your account. - What?

469
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:08,270
Hari, she's coming.

470
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:15,208
Hari!

471
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:17,620
- Here she comes.
- Here she comes.

472
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,784
Will you tell her that you love her?

473
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,200
What? No.

474
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,297
Our eyes should lock on each other we
should talk, sing duets, have fights..

475
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:28,316
..there are so many things to do.

476
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:29,614
You think she'll look at you?

477
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:32,355
Definitely. You can wait and watch.

478
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:35,415
The bet is for three days,
not for three months.

479
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:38,241
I know. I have my plans.

480
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:40,749
Now watch me.

481
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:42,652
Oh God!

482
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:01,013
Why is she showing me his fingers?

483
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,481
I sent you four cups of tea.

484
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,574
That whistle wasn't for us.
Can't you see?

485
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,541
Did you see that? She saw me.

486
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,172
- Did she?
- Yes, she did.

487
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:15,284
I didn't see it.

488
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:18,875
I know you are trying to
wiggle you way out of the bet.

489
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:21,791
- Hey, girls! Do you want some company?
- Look at the road, you idiots!

490
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:23,871
- Waste fellows!
- Right!

491
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:26,458
Yes, we are. See you later. Bye.

492
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:29,825
Did you see that?
Guys just go to that border.

493
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:31,758
They know they will die
if they cross that border.

494
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,533
You think nobody
can cross that border?

495
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:34,678
- Yes.
- Come with me.

496
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:37,099
- No, stop! Where are you taking me?
- Hop on.

497
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:39,670
Wait a minute.
Hari, the breaks don't work.

498
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,310
Just like me. Bye.

499
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,546
Buddy, please stop. Let me get down.

500
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:45,846
- Bye!
- Bye!

501
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:53,439
I don't want to go with you.
Stop the bike! Stop!

502
00:31:54,758 --> 00:31:56,232
Shut up.

503
00:31:57,738 --> 00:31:59,450
- Get down.
- Where are you going?

504
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,253
Give me a signal when
the girl comes this way.

505
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,898
What signal?
How can I do that if I die?

506
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:07,272
Hari, Stop. Don't leave me here.

507
00:32:07,352 --> 00:32:08,880
Stop, Hari.

508
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,925
Oh God! I might die of
this stink before she kills me.

509
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:15,203
Is she coming?

510
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,514
- No, buddy.
- See properly.

511
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:22,118
Oh God! Her uncle is coming.

512
00:32:22,198 --> 00:32:23,849
If he sees me here,
he'll sacrifice me to this dumpster.

513
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:26,313
Oh God! Where do I hide?

514
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,847
Oh no! Why is he coming?

515
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:34,825
God, if you save me from this goon,
I'll offer my hair to you.

516
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:45,056
Why is he opening his pants?
Will he pee on me?

517
00:32:58,216 --> 00:33:00,092
- Good.
- Rascal!

518
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:14,372
- Is she coming?
- Who?

519
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,066
Is the girl coming?

520
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,429
Yes, she's coming.

521
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,371
Oh, God!

522
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:51,745
Hey! Hey!

523
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:54,174
- Oh God!
- Hey!

524
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,424
- Oh dear, you fell down.
I'm very sorry. - Oh, no!

525
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,381
- I'll help you to get up. I'm so sorry.
- Okay, okay.

526
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:01,009
I thought he will confess
his feelings to her..

527
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:03,012
..but he made her fall down.
Her mother will kill us.

528
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:04,098
I've to run.

529
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:06,480
- I'm very sorry.
- Okay, okay.

530
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,169
- I'll help you to get up. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

531
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,291
- Please, get up. Get up.
- It's okay.

532
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,554
- Did you get hurt here?
- Okay, I'm okay.

533
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,050
Wait a minute.

534
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:27,864
- Here are your books.
- It's okay.

535
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:29,106
- I'm very sorry.
- Okay.

536
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:30,181
Wait a minute.

537
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:36,668
Here's your bag.
Take care. Don't ram into anyone else.

538
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:37,403
Okay.

539
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:40,443
'He rammed into me and
he is lecturing me. Idiot.'

540
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:54,275
'Did she see me?'

541
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,762
Where am I going?
These roads are confusing.

542
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:14,429
Did her uncles see me?

543
00:35:16,816 --> 00:35:19,435
Oh no! It wasn't me, sir.
I'm innocent.

544
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:22,393
- I don't know him, sir. I really..
- Hey, it's me.

545
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,574
You? Let go off my shirt!
Why did you do that?

546
00:35:24,654 --> 00:35:26,330
Guys usually protect
the girls they love.

547
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:28,305
But you tried to take her life.
Is she alive or dead?

548
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:31,597
Shut up. I didn't
ram into her to kill her.

549
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:34,337
I did that so that
she remembers me. Only me.

550
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:36,545
I don't know if your lady
love will remember you or not..

551
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,895
..but if she complains to her mother..

552
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:39,393
..that woman will
definitely remember us.

553
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:42,482
Don't be silly. I said sorry to her.

554
00:35:42,562 --> 00:35:44,400
She said it's okay and went her way.

555
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,704
She's so naive,
she doesn't know your intentions.

556
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:48,730
Okay, start the bike.
It will be dark soon.

557
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,158
Her mother and uncles
come to this area often.

558
00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:51,954
- Let's go.
- You coward! Hop on.

559
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:53,035
Let's go.

560
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:08,161
Darn!

561
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:11,995
Hello, bro!

562
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:27,344
Did she come out?

563
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:28,386
Not yet.

564
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:31,338
You've been here since
10 in the morning and now it's 4.

565
00:36:31,418 --> 00:36:33,013
She won't come out. Let's go.

566
00:36:43,165 --> 00:36:49,747
"Come out, my darling.
Let me see you."

567
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:56,262
"Come out and give me one smile."

568
00:36:56,342 --> 00:37:02,815
"I've been waiting
for you for so long."

569
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:08,731
"Give me a smile and make my day."

570
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:12,866
"Make my day."

571
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:16,696
She came out to take the clothes.
She didn't see you.

572
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,111
She saw me.
If you still doubt me, wait and watch.

573
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:23,668
She'll open the window as if to see if
it's still raining but she'll see me.

574
00:37:43,737 --> 00:37:45,044
Oh no! Her uncles are here.

575
00:37:47,054 --> 00:37:48,433
Your girl!

576
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,783
Will you ram into her again?

577
00:37:50,863 --> 00:37:52,216
That day nobody was around..

578
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:54,404
..but if you do it today people
will come and break your bones.

579
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:59,342
Oh God! Her uncles are here.
Go faster.

580
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:01,569
- Hello, bro!
- Hi, Chandu!

581
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:02,978
- Hello, bro!
- What are you all doing here?

582
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:05,343
Her uncles are going
to come any minute.

583
00:38:05,423 --> 00:38:07,035
Why do you want to take
the risk of talking to her?

584
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:08,194
Give me your leg.

585
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:09,742
God bless you!

586
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,230
I don't know if you'll
have legs when you come back.

587
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,356
Take care, buddy.

588
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:17,614
Hey! Hey!

589
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:46,158
You are the girl who rammed
into me the other day, right?

590
00:38:46,238 --> 00:38:48,250
How are you? Are you okay?

591
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,276
Did you go to the hospital?
Did you get hurt?

592
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:53,517
Show me your hand.

593
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,905
- Oh God!
- Did you get an X-ray or a scan?

594
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:59,163
I couldn't sleep all night.
I was thinking about you.

595
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,964
'Why is she walking away?'

596
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:03,972
'Why is this fellow following me?'

597
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,858
Hello! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

598
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:07,977
Wait! Wait! Wait!

599
00:39:08,374 --> 00:39:09,344
Okay, bye.

600
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:10,720
Brother! Why are you walking away?

601
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:13,136
- Brother!
- Go to the hospital without delay.

602
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:14,191
Get lost!

603
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:18,222
They are coming.
He's dead. I'll escape.

604
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,291
Yuck! It stinks like week old garbage.

605
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:27,238
Hey, didn't the garbage
man come to collect your waste?

606
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:28,168
You are here, right?

607
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:30,826
Why are they coming here?

608
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:39,576
If she doesn't look at you,
you should forget her. Okay?

609
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:40,830
She'll definitely come.

610
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,407
How can you be so sure?

611
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:45,133
I'm confident.
She'll definitely look at me.

612
00:39:45,213 --> 00:39:46,897
- He's looking at you.
- Shut up.

613
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,143
- She's coming.
- Where?

614
00:39:48,223 --> 00:39:49,741
You are looking at him too.

615
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,970
- There, she looked at me.
- You looked at him.

616
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,207
- No, I didn't.
- She didn't see you, buddy.

617
00:40:05,935 --> 00:40:07,094
There, she's looking at me.

618
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:08,501
- She is not.
- She is.

619
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,507
She looked at me a minute ago. Darn.

620
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:18,785
- No, buddy.
- There, she's looking at me again.

621
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,681
What did you say?

622
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:22,500
Why is she doing this to me?

623
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,256
- Why are you telling lies?
- I said shut up.

624
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:28,910
Do you think I'm blind?
I saw you looking at him.

625
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:31,537
I saw it too.

626
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:32,978
Stop talking.

627
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,385
- I said I didn't look at him.
- Now watch me.

628
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,196
- Venkanna!
- Yes.

629
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:37,536
I asked you 5 cups of tea.

630
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:41,079
Why are you ignoring me?

631
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:43,719
I came here for you.

632
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:45,884
I've been waiting for so long.

633
00:40:45,964 --> 00:40:48,351
Don't you have any mercy?

634
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:51,290
How can you do this to me?

635
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,494
He's begging you.

636
00:40:53,574 --> 00:40:55,518
- Look at him just once.
- Please show me kindness.

637
00:40:55,598 --> 00:40:57,657
Why is he giving me
so much respect today?

638
00:40:57,737 --> 00:41:00,314
No way. He's talking to them, not you.

639
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:10,682
Guys! Look, she's looking at me.

640
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:14,427
- She looked at me.
- No, she didn't.

641
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:16,621
- What did she see?
- You shut up.

642
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:17,952
They are talking about something else.

643
00:41:18,032 --> 00:41:19,312
You've been fighting
over it since morning.

644
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:24,255
She looked.
No, she didn't. Why do you care?

645
00:41:24,335 --> 00:41:26,235
We'll get free beers
if she doesn't look at him.

646
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:30,102
There's still time.
Let's see who buys the beers.

647
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:32,384
Take as much time as you want.
She won't look.

648
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:34,116
- Keep the money ready for beers.
- That's right.

649
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:45,261
They appear as soon as
I start thinking about a guy.

650
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:47,524
Everyone has a problem with me.

651
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:49,710
Her husband got drunk
and fell down on the road.

652
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,138
But she's upset that
I asked her about it.

653
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:52,969
Why are you always angry, mom?

654
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:55,663
Nobody respects a
woman without a husband.

655
00:41:55,743 --> 00:41:58,943
I need to be a shrew in
order to survive amidst them.

656
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:03,473
Why are you sitting in
front of the mirror at this time?

657
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:05,346
Get ready and go to college.

658
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:06,961
You are always scolding me.

659
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:11,859
Today is the last day.
You'll win if she looks at you.

660
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:14,105
Otherwise accept defeat
and buy beers for us.

661
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:20,797
Where is he?

662
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:22,586
Maybe he went to buy beers.

663
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,569
Why are you hiding here?

664
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:27,404
Are her uncles bringing chili powder?

665
00:42:27,484 --> 00:42:29,423
No. She looks at me but
turns away when you look at her.

666
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,739
She looks at me when
you all are not looking.

667
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:34,666
If I hide, you'll know
if she's looking at me or not.

668
00:42:34,746 --> 00:42:36,076
Now wait and watch.
She'll look for me.

669
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:37,247
Alright.

670
00:42:40,762 --> 00:42:42,040
Look at her.

671
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:44,764
'Why can't I see him?'

672
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:46,907
Yes, buddy. She's looking for you.

673
00:42:46,987 --> 00:42:49,249
- 'They usually stand here.'
- She's looking for you, buddy.

674
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:50,523
'Oh God!'

675
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:52,462
There's no doubt at all.
She's looking for you.

676
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,002
I told you so,
but you didn't believe me.

677
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:56,041
I knew it.
I knew it. Now see what I'll do.

678
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:57,838
She's going. She's going.

679
00:42:57,918 --> 00:42:58,963
'He's usually here.'

680
00:42:59,043 --> 00:42:59,796
Shout my name.

681
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:01,366
But you are right here.
Why should I shout?

682
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:03,873
Hey, shout my name. Shout Hari.

683
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:04,916
But you are right here.

684
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:06,945
She's going. She's going.

685
00:43:07,025 --> 00:43:09,775
- Shout my name.
- Hari!

686
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:46,838
Yes! Yes!

687
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:49,190
Catch! Come on, catch! Catch!

688
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:06,538
Oh no, the soap fell down.

689
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:09,422
To your left. To your left.

690
00:44:09,502 --> 00:44:11,215
Left! Left! To your left.

691
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,595
Now to your right.

692
00:44:14,187 --> 00:44:18,205
Follow my instructions.
Lift your hands.

693
00:44:19,162 --> 00:44:21,814
Left. Move them to your left.

694
00:44:22,414 --> 00:44:23,712
Move them forward. Move them forward.

695
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:26,408
Yes! Black woman! Fat woman!

696
00:44:26,488 --> 00:44:28,915
Can't you hear me? Have you gone deaf?

697
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:35,990
Rascal! How dare you
watch a woman taking bath?

698
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,114
- Rascal!
- She broke my skull.

699
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:44,287
- Get up. Get up.
- Oh God!

700
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:45,469
How did you fall?

701
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,614
She would've killed me
if I rolled down that side.

702
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:49,714
- Did she hit you with a pot?
- How did you know?

703
00:44:49,794 --> 00:44:51,429
She did the same
thing to me yesterday.

704
00:44:51,509 --> 00:44:52,604
Hello!

705
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:56,531
Hari! She's coming.

706
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,006
"Hari! Hari!"

707
00:44:59,953 --> 00:45:01,377
"Hari! Hari!"

708
00:45:11,391 --> 00:45:13,028
"Hari! Hari!"

709
00:45:13,706 --> 00:45:15,193
"Hari! Hari!"

710
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:19,652
- Isn't your boss here?
- No. Why?

711
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:21,179
It seems you took scrap
from the house the other day..

712
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:23,896
..but didn't give money.
Mom asked me to bring it.

713
00:45:23,976 --> 00:45:26,911
Our boss isn't here.
Will you come back tomorrow?

714
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:30,275
What? Do you think I
don't have any other work?

715
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:33,037
I'll wait here till he
comes and leave with the money.

716
00:45:43,151 --> 00:45:44,921
"Hari! Hari!"

717
00:45:45,573 --> 00:45:46,469
"Hari! Hari!"

718
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:50,158
She came for you. I'm sure of it.

719
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:52,814
This is the right time.
There's nobody at the shop.

720
00:45:52,894 --> 00:45:54,823
We'll stand outside
and guard the place.

721
00:45:54,903 --> 00:45:56,625
You go to her and directly..

722
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:58,189
Hey, I can't do that.

723
00:45:58,269 --> 00:45:59,870
Come out of your gutter mind.

724
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:01,895
I just want you to go
confess your feelings to her.

725
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:03,671
I'm scared.

726
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:06,240
At first you'll be scared,
but after that you'll feel good.

727
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,257
- Really?
- Yes.

728
00:46:07,337 --> 00:46:08,604
Go tell her that you love her.

729
00:46:08,747 --> 00:46:09,868
Alright then.

730
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:21,317
- Tell her.
- Tell her, Hari.

731
00:46:21,397 --> 00:46:22,330
What do you want?

732
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:25,086
I.. I.. I want that.

733
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:26,226
What is that?

734
00:46:26,306 --> 00:46:29,052
That. I want that.

735
00:46:30,277 --> 00:46:32,651
- There is nothing here.
- There is nothing here?

736
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:34,989
- I wish there was.
- Oh.

737
00:46:38,022 --> 00:46:40,151
Yes, I want that.

738
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:42,346
Gross! Take it!

739
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:46,698
Disgusting.

740
00:46:47,698 --> 00:46:49,634
Idiot, didn't you get anything else?

741
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,460
Darn! Scrap fellows.

742
00:47:27,651 --> 00:47:29,285
Does it hurt?

743
00:47:44,468 --> 00:47:45,976
If it feels so good to see it..

744
00:47:46,056 --> 00:47:47,948
..I wonder how good it
will be to actually feel it.

745
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:51,823
Hurry up. If you delay,
she'll drink all your blood.

746
00:47:55,867 --> 00:47:57,132
Oh God! Boss is here.

747
00:47:57,212 --> 00:47:58,560
Hari, ask her to leave your finger.

748
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,239
What are you doing here?
Don't you have any work?

749
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:03,501
Who is that girl?

750
00:48:06,558 --> 00:48:08,288
- 'What should I tell him?'
- Who are you, dear?

751
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:09,742
She came for you, boss.

752
00:48:09,822 --> 00:48:11,799
It seems you owe her
mom some money for scrap.

753
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:13,183
- She came here to take the money.
- What?

754
00:48:13,263 --> 00:48:15,595
I already paid it with Paytm.
Didn't she get it?

755
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:17,467
Oh, you paid it with Paytm?

756
00:48:17,547 --> 00:48:20,136
My mom doesn't know
how to check it. Thanks.

757
00:48:20,216 --> 00:48:22,951
- 'That was a close call.' - I can never
understand this generation kids.

758
00:48:23,031 --> 00:48:24,907
- Get back to work.
- Okay, boss.

759
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:26,961
"Hari! Hari!"

760
00:48:27,343 --> 00:48:29,207
"Hari! Hari!"

761
00:48:53,165 --> 00:48:55,502
"Hari! Hari!"

762
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:57,798
"Hari! Hari!"

763
00:48:57,878 --> 00:49:00,339
"Hari! Hari!"

764
00:49:00,419 --> 00:49:02,857
"Hari! Hari!"

765
00:49:12,295 --> 00:49:14,700
"Hari! Hari!"

766
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,046
"Hari! Hari!"

767
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:21,884
"Don't provoke me so."

768
00:49:21,964 --> 00:49:26,452
"Don't turn this into a spectacle."

769
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:31,296
"Your smile is enough
to put my body on fire."

770
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:36,092
"Your look is enough to
win the World Cup 100 times."

771
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:42,019
"If you say yes, I'll come
with a procession to marry you."

772
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:47,165
"Come to me, I'm ready for you."

773
00:49:51,497 --> 00:49:56,778
"My bridegroom, don't bet with me."

774
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:06,303
"Don't provoke me so."

775
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:11,084
"Don't turn this into a spectacle."

776
00:50:11,164 --> 00:50:13,520
"Hari! Hari!"

777
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,193
"Hari! Hari!"

778
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:39,886
"I'll kiss your milky cheeks."

779
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:44,401
"I'll hit you if you pinch my waist."

780
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:49,459
"Wait and watch,
darling, I'll steal your breath."

781
00:50:49,539 --> 00:50:54,343
"Be ready for me,
I'm packing my things."

782
00:50:54,423 --> 00:50:56,742
"Hari! Hari!"

783
00:50:56,822 --> 00:50:58,806
"Hari! Hari!"

784
00:50:58,886 --> 00:51:04,931
"If you say yes, I'll carry you home."

785
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:10,242
"Come to me, I'm ready for you."

786
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:19,790
"My bridegroom, don't bet with me."

787
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:29,030
"Don't provoke me so."

788
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:34,172
"Don't turn this into a spectacle."

789
00:51:57,904 --> 00:52:02,608
"I'll enjoy eating
you like an ice-cream."

790
00:52:02,688 --> 00:52:07,228
"I'll be waiting for you on my bed."

791
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:12,252
"Let's forget milk and
fruits and get started."

792
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:17,113
"Let's not wait for auspicious
time and get started."

793
00:52:17,193 --> 00:52:19,512
"Hari! Hari!"

794
00:52:19,592 --> 00:52:21,611
"Hari! Hari!"

795
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:27,678
"If you say yes, I'll keep
you up until the cock crows."

796
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:32,739
"Come to me, I'm ready for you."

797
00:52:37,181 --> 00:52:42,050
"My bridegroom, don't bet with me."

798
00:52:47,029 --> 00:52:48,985
"Hari! Hari!"

799
00:52:49,442 --> 00:52:51,418
"Hari! Hari!"

800
00:52:54,702 --> 00:52:58,808
We were so lost in our
love that we forgot the world.

801
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:01,112
Only me and her.

802
00:53:01,192 --> 00:53:04,483
Very good.
Your love story is interesting.

803
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,177
Even Mani Ratnam and Bala Chandra
cannot come up with such love stories.

804
00:53:08,257 --> 00:53:09,745
But you came up with it.

805
00:53:11,628 --> 00:53:14,035
This ACP will not leave me in peace.

806
00:53:14,253 --> 00:53:15,390
- Let go off my bag!
- Give it to me!

807
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:16,777
- No, this is my bag!
- Give it to me!

808
00:53:16,857 --> 00:53:18,054
- Rajesh!
- Give it me.

809
00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:19,869
- Yes, sir.
- Did the informer tell you anything?

810
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:21,172
He hasn't said a single
word even after I beat him up.

811
00:53:21,252 --> 00:53:22,662
But there's something in his bag.

812
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:25,091
What's in that bag? Bring him out.

813
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,335
- Give me the bag.
- No. I won't give it.

814
00:53:28,415 --> 00:53:29,945
Rajesh, take that bag from him.

815
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:32,637
- Give it to me.
- Sir, this is about my honor.

816
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:35,190
Tell him not to open it.
Please, sir. I beg of you.

817
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,901
My God!

818
00:53:42,517 --> 00:53:45,709
Why do you need so many condoms?

819
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,494
I feel uncomfortable everytime
I go to buy a packet.

820
00:53:48,574 --> 00:53:50,906
When I saw a good offer,
I bought them in bulk.

821
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:52,329
Sir!

822
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,871
Ramesh, bring him to me.

823
00:54:01,124 --> 00:54:04,324
Okay, you followed her,
told her that you love her..

824
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:07,006
..then convinced
her to elope with you.

825
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:11,169
- What aren't you telling me?
- I don't know anything else, sir.

826
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:15,656
Hey! I know guys tell
lies to girls and police.

827
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,041
I've seen many people
like you in my life.

828
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,136
Come on!

829
00:54:39,412 --> 00:54:42,597
- Who is he? - Last night
that girl travelled in his auto.

830
00:54:42,873 --> 00:54:45,168
He's the prime witness
of the incident.

831
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,456
- What's your name?
- Nazir.

832
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,123
What happened last night?

833
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,278
I witnessed a murder
for the first time in my life.

834
00:54:54,201 --> 00:54:56,289
She was my first customer that night.

835
00:54:56,369 --> 00:54:59,474
I was going in my auto
and she came to me in a hurry.

836
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:01,522
I took pity on her since she's
a girl and asked her to get in.

837
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:03,930
When I asked her where to,
she said to the bus stand.

838
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,222
But suddenly this man
came there out of nowhere.

839
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:16,551
'Where do you think you are going?'

840
00:55:20,748 --> 00:55:23,073
'How dare you deceive
me and run away with him?'

841
00:55:24,548 --> 00:55:27,279
He stabbed that girl and ran away.

842
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,520
Sir, he's telling lies.

843
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,849
Sir, I saw him running away.

844
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:31,068
- Hey!
- He's the one, sir.

845
00:55:31,148 --> 00:55:34,759
- What are you talking about?
I'll kill you! - He's the one, sir.

846
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:35,917
Lock him up.

847
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,306
I'll kill you!

848
00:55:42,184 --> 00:55:46,001
I'll kill him! I don't know who he is.

849
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:48,592
He's the one who stabbed her!

850
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,705
How dare you!

851
00:55:59,787 --> 00:56:03,415
Let me go! Let me go! I'll kill him!

852
00:56:04,984 --> 00:56:06,997
He's telling lies!

853
00:56:07,077 --> 00:56:09,891
- Nazir! Give us your details
and go home. - Okay, sir.

854
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:12,361
- You should come back when
we call you. Okay? - Okay, sir.

855
00:56:12,441 --> 00:56:16,300
I'll make you pay for it. You rascal!

856
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,232
Should I tell you
what really happened?

857
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,416
You asked her to come
to your room at night.

858
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,095
You wanted to use
her for your pleasure.

859
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:26,017
When she refused you,
you stabbed her. Right?

860
00:56:34,473 --> 00:56:35,974
How can you say that, sir?

861
00:56:36,054 --> 00:56:39,799
How can I stab my Shirisha?
Where is my Shirisha?

862
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:03,349
He's trying to escape. Catch him!

863
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:20,290
Drag him back here!

864
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:38,135
Give me the rifle!

865
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:47,531
How dare you!

866
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,715
How dare you grab
a policeman's collar!

867
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:00,571
Shirisha..

868
00:58:04,029 --> 00:58:05,553
Shirisha..

869
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,204
Shirisha..

870
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,914
Shirisha..

871
00:58:17,808 --> 00:58:19,994
Gangaram! Did he confess?

872
00:58:20,074 --> 00:58:22,043
He will. I will make him.

873
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,142
Okay. Carry on.

874
00:58:23,222 --> 00:58:25,371
- Order a tea for me.
- Okay, sir.

875
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:33,760
Shirisha!

876
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:38,872
Come.

877
00:58:40,692 --> 00:58:42,203
Shirisha!

878
00:58:42,283 --> 00:58:45,425
Come.

879
00:58:47,615 --> 00:58:49,132
Come.

880
00:58:50,279 --> 00:58:51,222
- Sir!
- What is it?

881
00:58:51,302 --> 00:58:54,484
We found this wallet
at the crime scene.

882
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,118
Who is Rahul? Bring him in.

883
00:58:58,198 --> 00:59:01,941
Sir, he is Mayor
Rajeshwari Devi's son.

884
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:04,365
Mayor Rajeshwari Devi's son?

885
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:08,789
'Shut up!'

886
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:31,922
Mom!

887
00:59:35,889 --> 00:59:37,656
I didn't do anything.

888
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:39,428
Open the cell.

889
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:40,745
We'll be in trouble
when the CI comes in, madam.

890
00:59:40,825 --> 00:59:41,947
Shut up!

891
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,291
Who do you think you are?

892
00:59:44,595 --> 00:59:47,247
You arrest people without
knowing who they are?

893
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,496
You stepped on a landmine.

894
00:59:49,576 --> 00:59:51,916
Release my son before
the bodies start to fall.

895
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:55,368
Excuse me, madam! I locked him up.

896
01:00:02,161 --> 01:00:03,676
Bravo!

897
01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:10,950
Bravo! Such a sincere police officer!

898
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,656
You should be commended.

899
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:14,324
Now the truth.

900
01:00:14,404 --> 01:00:16,105
How much did you take from my enemies?

901
01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:17,698
- Madam, you are..
- Shut up!

902
01:00:18,212 --> 01:00:20,453
How much did they give you?
What's your price?

903
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,325
If you don't like it,
arrange for a deal with my enemies.

904
01:00:23,405 --> 01:00:25,766
One time, two times, three times..

905
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:28,099
..I'll buy you over hundred times.

906
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:29,534
- Madam!
- Shut up!

907
01:00:30,424 --> 01:00:32,619
I've my men in the
opposition party too.

908
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:35,329
On one side, the opposition
party will go to the CBI office..

909
01:00:35,409 --> 01:00:37,879
..to file a complaint
that you are taking bribes.

910
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:39,709
And on the other side,
your superiors are..

911
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:44,786
..in my guesthouse deciding
on a reason to suspend you.

912
01:00:45,085 --> 01:00:47,210
How is my plan?

913
01:00:47,784 --> 01:00:51,205
Hey! Release him!

914
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:53,194
Come on, open the cell.

915
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,811
My lawyers will discuss
the remaining details.

916
01:01:03,498 --> 01:01:06,707
You know to kill
only during encounters.

917
01:01:06,787 --> 01:01:10,168
I learnt to do surgical attacks
when I was just in college.

918
01:01:10,248 --> 01:01:11,638
Get lost!

919
01:01:20,783 --> 01:01:22,572
Madam, your son drove
a car while he was drunk..

920
01:01:22,652 --> 01:01:24,328
..and killed two
people in an accident.

921
01:01:24,408 --> 01:01:26,388
- Did you see it?
- The ones who saw it told us.

922
01:01:26,468 --> 01:01:30,611
This is a conspiracy
by the opposition party.

923
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:32,073
What evidence do you have?

924
01:01:32,153 --> 01:01:33,779
Just like the ones
who saw it told you..

925
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:35,413
..they gave me the evidence too.

926
01:01:35,493 --> 01:01:37,691
My son has nothing
to do with the accident.

927
01:01:37,771 --> 01:01:38,792
It's a Benz car.

928
01:01:38,872 --> 01:01:40,937
So the fault is with
the Mercedes company..

929
01:01:41,017 --> 01:01:43,298
..my driver and the
ones who gave him a license.

930
01:01:43,378 --> 01:01:44,793
They are responsible for this.

931
01:01:44,873 --> 01:01:46,636
How can you walk away
with just one comment, madam?

932
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:49,531
TV channels are very good
at showing that one comment..

933
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:51,153
..in hundred different ways.

934
01:01:51,233 --> 01:01:53,954
You can use this
comment the whole month.

935
01:01:54,034 --> 01:01:55,395
Now get lost! Come on, son.

936
01:02:03,699 --> 01:02:06,439
- Venkat, bring him out!
- Okay, sir.

937
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,475
- What are you looking at?
- What?

938
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:11,547
What? Don't shout!

939
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:14,722
Come on out! Come out!

940
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:22,982
Do you know Rahul?

941
01:02:23,456 --> 01:02:25,927
Do you know Mayor
Rajeshwari Devi's son?

942
01:02:29,867 --> 01:02:31,208
Answer me.

943
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:37,497
- Answer me.
- I know him.

944
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:28,253
Do you know Mayor
Rajeshwari Devi's son?

945
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,265
I know him.

946
01:03:56,089 --> 01:04:00,101
I'm so lucky. Where did you go?

947
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:04,258
I saw you that day
but then you disappeared.

948
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:08,445
Do you know how long
I've been searching for you?

949
01:04:09,056 --> 01:04:10,986
Finally I found you.

950
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:15,017
Come on, get into my car.

951
01:04:15,097 --> 01:04:16,484
What? Who are you?

952
01:04:16,564 --> 01:04:17,893
Let's talk on the way.

953
01:04:17,973 --> 01:04:19,460
Hey! Let go off my hand!

954
01:04:24,934 --> 01:04:26,797
- What?
- What?

955
01:04:27,581 --> 01:04:28,827
Is she your friend?

956
01:04:29,813 --> 01:04:32,963
Oh, hi. I'm Rahul.

957
01:04:33,907 --> 01:04:37,238
Son of Mayor Rajeshwari Devi.

958
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:49,382
Hi, I'm Hari Krishna.
Care of Scrap Shop.

959
01:04:50,038 --> 01:04:51,665
How long have you known her?

960
01:04:51,745 --> 01:04:54,204
- Ever since Valentine's Day.
- Really?

961
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:02,883
That was the first time I saw her too.

962
01:05:21,855 --> 01:05:24,374
What a coincidence!

963
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:28,530
We both saw the same
girl on the same day.

964
01:05:29,683 --> 01:05:32,074
- I couldn't meet her that day.
- And I chose her.

965
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,906
If you don't mind,
I want to tell her something.

966
01:05:34,986 --> 01:05:35,796
Go ahead.

967
01:05:36,915 --> 01:05:38,499
I love you.

968
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:43,395
If you don't mind,
I'll make her say something.

969
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:45,315
- Okay.
- Come here, Shirisha.

970
01:05:53,176 --> 01:05:55,562
I love Hari.

971
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:01,482
Got it? Now leave in your car,
and we'll leave on our cycle.

972
01:06:01,562 --> 01:06:02,897
Let's go, Hari.

973
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,875
Oh, you came home.

974
01:06:17,955 --> 01:06:20,359
Instead of roaming outside
in the name of jogging..

975
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:22,126
..and walking,
why can't you help around the house?

976
01:06:22,206 --> 01:06:23,674
You are there to do
the work at home, mom.

977
01:06:23,754 --> 01:06:26,367
Yes, I'll come to your in-laws
house to do the work there.

978
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:30,030
Now take a shower and
get ready for college. Go on.

979
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,652
Okay, I'm going.

980
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:32,337
It made a good sound
but it didn't hurt.

981
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:33,874
You need to take B-Complex
to gain strength.

982
01:07:33,954 --> 01:07:35,687
Don't you have any shame?

983
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:37,197
Shame? Why?

984
01:07:37,277 --> 01:07:40,112
I enjoyed your touch.

985
01:07:40,192 --> 01:07:41,238
Are you a human being?

986
01:07:41,318 --> 01:07:42,736
How dare you take photos
of a girl when she's bathing?

987
01:07:42,816 --> 01:07:48,250
Even when you are fully clothes,
my body heats up.

988
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,741
I wanted to see how it
feels to see you without clothes.

989
01:07:51,821 --> 01:07:54,180
I don't know who to blame for it,
your body or my eyes.

990
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,900
Idiot! Disgusting!

991
01:08:10,603 --> 01:08:12,621
You can't escape from me.

992
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:14,009
I'll kill you.

993
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:19,478
Just say yes, I'll kill myself.

994
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:20,754
Animals are better than you.
Disgusting.

995
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:24,284
Yes, they obey you if you hit them.

996
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:27,376
But the more you hit me,
the more I'll chase you.

997
01:08:27,456 --> 01:08:28,812
Let me go.

998
01:08:28,892 --> 01:08:31,424
Give me an answer about my proposal.

999
01:08:31,717 --> 01:08:32,872
Don't ask me anything.

1000
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:35,749
I won't ask. I'll just take it.

1001
01:08:37,498 --> 01:08:38,337
Let me go.

1002
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:42,413
Let me go. Somebody is at the door.
We can talk later.

1003
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,575
- Where?
- Not here.

1004
01:08:45,673 --> 01:08:46,670
Yes, tell me.

1005
01:08:46,934 --> 01:08:48,246
Should we go to a movie?

1006
01:08:48,326 --> 01:08:49,474
I have a class.

1007
01:08:49,554 --> 01:08:50,667
You have classes every day.

1008
01:08:50,747 --> 01:08:52,446
It's okay if you miss one,
let's go to a movie.

1009
01:08:52,526 --> 01:08:53,365
I won't come.

1010
01:08:53,445 --> 01:08:54,586
You have to come. That's it.

1011
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:55,780
Okay, bye.

1012
01:08:58,388 --> 01:09:00,140
You've peed enough. Let's go.

1013
01:09:00,283 --> 01:09:03,065
Wow, you are taking us
to a movie after a long time.

1014
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,261
Hi!

1015
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:17,725
What is this?
You called me to Coffee Day..

1016
01:09:17,883 --> 01:09:19,814
..and now you are going
to a movie with him?

1017
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:21,210
This is cheating.

1018
01:09:21,603 --> 01:09:22,999
What's your problem?

1019
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:25,351
Will you spend a night with me?

1020
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:32,378
What is wrong with you?

1021
01:09:46,144 --> 01:09:47,473
Sweet cream.

1022
01:09:50,694 --> 01:09:53,689
Hari, she's coming.

1023
01:09:54,877 --> 01:09:56,752
Welcome. I've been waiting for you.

1024
01:09:56,832 --> 01:09:57,823
We are getting late. Shall we go?

1025
01:09:57,903 --> 01:09:58,684
Hari, I don't want to go to a movie.

1026
01:09:58,764 --> 01:09:59,906
- Why?
- I don't want to go.

1027
01:09:59,986 --> 01:10:01,292
- What happened?
- I'm not in the mood.

1028
01:10:01,372 --> 01:10:03,386
- But why?
- I said no.

1029
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:09,388
What happened, Siri?

1030
01:10:10,062 --> 01:10:11,596
- Do you know what he said?
- Who?

1031
01:10:11,676 --> 01:10:12,517
Rahul!

1032
01:10:12,597 --> 01:10:13,664
What did he say?

1033
01:10:18,765 --> 01:10:19,612
What did he say?

1034
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:20,526
Forget it.

1035
01:10:20,787 --> 01:10:22,565
- Tell me what he said.
- I said forget it.

1036
01:10:22,645 --> 01:10:24,393
You said he said something.
Tell me what he said.

1037
01:10:26,773 --> 01:10:27,917
Hi, bro!

1038
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:39,371
You look upset.
It was a simple request.

1039
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:40,598
What did you say to Siri?

1040
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,431
You shouldn't be so sensitive.

1041
01:10:44,554 --> 01:10:45,550
What did you say?

1042
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:46,874
I asked her to sleep with me.

1043
01:10:50,057 --> 01:10:52,626
I asked her to spend a night with me.

1044
01:10:54,566 --> 01:10:56,895
It is wrong to ask her to marry me.

1045
01:10:57,329 --> 01:10:59,733
But it's not wrong
to ask for one night.

1046
01:11:01,172 --> 01:11:05,046
Are you angry? Will you hit me?

1047
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,722
Will you murder me? What will you do?

1048
01:11:15,358 --> 01:11:16,416
Hey!

1049
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:19,579
I feel dizzy. Put me down.

1050
01:11:24,767 --> 01:11:26,414
Put me down.

1051
01:11:27,092 --> 01:11:28,275
My God!

1052
01:11:49,254 --> 01:11:50,140
Hari!

1053
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,510
She's coming.

1054
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,935
Hari!

1055
01:11:57,799 --> 01:12:00,927
Hi! I was going to text you,
but you came to see me.

1056
01:12:01,007 --> 01:12:02,408
Are you free? Let's go out.

1057
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:05,811
No, I'm very busy today.
You remember the bungalow?

1058
01:12:05,891 --> 01:12:06,461
Which bungalow?

1059
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:08,571
The other day you came
to pick up scrap, that one.

1060
01:12:08,651 --> 01:12:10,183
My mom is going out of town today.

1061
01:12:10,263 --> 01:12:12,045
So I have to take
care of the old couple.

1062
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,791
I'll be all alone there tonight.

1063
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:17,427
- So?
- I came to inform you.

1064
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:19,708
I'll be there till tomorrow morning.

1065
01:12:19,788 --> 01:12:22,275
- I can't meet you.
- I see. Okay.

1066
01:12:22,355 --> 01:12:23,556
- Yadigiri!
- Yes?

1067
01:12:23,636 --> 01:12:25,601
We'll go to Borabanda first,
then go to Sanath Nagar..

1068
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:26,968
..and then come back
to the shop, okay?

1069
01:12:27,048 --> 01:12:28,137
Hello! Stop it!

1070
01:12:28,217 --> 01:12:31,236
You can discuss that later.
First focus on me.

1071
01:12:31,316 --> 01:12:34,003
You do you work and I'll do my work.

1072
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,370
I'll be all alone.

1073
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,765
After an hour don't
come knocking saying..

1074
01:12:38,845 --> 01:12:41,075
..that you can't
stay without seeing me.

1075
01:12:41,155 --> 01:12:45,074
Because I'll be all alone.
So don't come.

1076
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:47,938
Because I'll be all alone.

1077
01:12:48,018 --> 01:12:49,405
I don't understand anything.

1078
01:12:49,485 --> 01:12:51,993
I'll be all alone. Understood?

1079
01:12:52,073 --> 01:12:52,968
What is she saying?

1080
01:12:53,048 --> 01:12:54,947
Hari, take a shower
and go there immediately.

1081
01:12:55,027 --> 01:12:56,953
- Where?
- Where else?

1082
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:58,398
To the bungalow. Come on, hurry.

1083
01:12:58,478 --> 01:12:59,482
Don't you have any sense?

1084
01:12:59,562 --> 01:13:02,012
She told me not to come and you
are shamelessly asking me to go there.

1085
01:13:02,092 --> 01:13:06,249
Hari, when a girl says no,
it usually means yes. Go on.

1086
01:13:25,822 --> 01:13:28,158
He's not an idiot. He came.

1087
01:13:28,391 --> 01:13:29,526
Who is it?

1088
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:33,477
There's nobody at home.

1089
01:13:33,557 --> 01:13:34,430
Hey!

1090
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:20,237
"Don't look at me like that."

1091
01:14:20,317 --> 01:14:27,189
"I feel shy when you
look at me like that."

1092
01:14:27,269 --> 01:14:33,924
"When I look at you like this.."

1093
01:14:34,004 --> 01:14:40,859
"I go crazy when I
look at you like this."

1094
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:47,859
"Don't ask me anything,
don't demand that I give it to you."

1095
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:50,994
"Why don't you stay away from me?"

1096
01:14:51,257 --> 01:14:54,612
"Why are you getting closer to me?"

1097
01:14:54,692 --> 01:14:58,114
"Shall I tickle you
and make you breathless?"

1098
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:01,584
"It is time for us to become one."

1099
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:11,614
"Don't look at me like that."

1100
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:18,728
"I feel shy when you
look at me like that."

1101
01:15:39,829 --> 01:15:46,142
"I'm sure you cast
a magic spell on me."

1102
01:15:46,222 --> 01:15:49,560
"I can't stay away
from you even for minute."

1103
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,111
"You mesmerized me with your eyes."

1104
01:15:53,191 --> 01:15:59,774
"My heart doesn't listen to me.
It is yours now."

1105
01:15:59,854 --> 01:16:03,242
"I'll hide you inside my heart."

1106
01:16:03,322 --> 01:16:06,652
"I'll make all my dreams come true."

1107
01:16:06,732 --> 01:16:10,017
"I'll tell you my desires
and increase your heart rate."

1108
01:16:10,097 --> 01:16:13,590
"I'm so lost in your
that I'm forgetting myself."

1109
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:23,457
"When I look at you like this.."

1110
01:16:23,767 --> 01:16:30,833
"I go crazy when I
look at you like this."

1111
01:16:51,692 --> 01:16:58,083
"You baited me and
I'm your prisoner now."

1112
01:16:58,163 --> 01:17:01,500
"We are always lost in our dreams."

1113
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,857
"Let's get naughty and
wrap our bodies together."

1114
01:17:04,937 --> 01:17:08,437
"Let's unite our
worlds and stay as one."

1115
01:17:08,517 --> 01:17:11,897
"Let's spend our nights
in each other's arms."

1116
01:17:11,977 --> 01:17:18,332
"You are my life,
I started breathing after I saw you."

1117
01:17:18,608 --> 01:17:25,459
"You are my life.
I will follow you everywhere you go."

1118
01:17:25,539 --> 01:17:35,673
"Don't look at me like that."

1119
01:17:35,753 --> 01:17:42,895
"I feel shy when you
look at me like that."

1120
01:17:45,569 --> 01:17:46,627
Shirisha!

1121
01:17:48,322 --> 01:17:49,323
Mom!

1122
01:17:50,809 --> 01:17:52,262
Don't you have any shame?

1123
01:17:52,949 --> 01:17:55,840
Didn't you find anyone
other than that scrap collector?

1124
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:59,302
I'm ashamed to call you my daughter.
Wretched girl.

1125
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:04,545
Hari, whether the lion
comes out of the cage..

1126
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:06,927
..or we go into the
lion's cage, we die.

1127
01:18:07,007 --> 01:18:08,382
Listen to me and pack your bags.

1128
01:18:08,462 --> 01:18:11,382
We missed the last bus, but we can
catch the first bus tomorrow morning.

1129
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:13,380
She chased us and
beat us up even before..

1130
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:16,579
..you confessed your feelings
to her daughter. Let's go.

1131
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:20,287
Yes. I'm sure she's readying
knives or chili powder for us.

1132
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:23,302
She'll be here any minute. Let's go.

1133
01:18:23,382 --> 01:18:24,564
Let's go, buddy.

1134
01:18:24,644 --> 01:18:29,640
Is this what you've been up to?
I'll have to do something.

1135
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:35,361

1136

[ENGLISH RAP SONG]

1137
01:18:39,947 --> 01:18:42,105
How do we look in this attire?

1138
01:18:42,185 --> 01:18:44,944
We look like factionists,
but without weapons.

1139
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:48,017
These are Ramaraju's
'dhotis.' Very comfortable.

1140
01:18:48,097 --> 01:18:49,598
He must be so embarrassed to be naked.

1141
01:18:49,678 --> 01:18:51,093
Why did you bring his 'dhotis' for us?

1142
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:54,320
No, I'm not talking about
the Ramaraju who has HIV.

1143
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,980
Ramaraju is a brand name.

1144
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,698
You didn't tell us where we are going.

1145
01:18:58,778 --> 01:19:00,071
I'll tell you. Come on.

1146
01:19:00,151 --> 01:19:01,350
I wonder where he's taking us.

1147
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,402
Why did you bring us
to the Pakistan border?

1148
01:19:05,482 --> 01:19:07,013
I hope we are not in danger.

1149
01:19:07,093 --> 01:19:09,890
I heard your conversation last night.

1150
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:12,219
I'll help Hari to
get married to that girl.

1151
01:19:12,299 --> 01:19:13,991
Come on, let's talk to her mother.

1152
01:19:14,071 --> 01:19:14,942
No.

1153
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:17,516
Talking to her mother
is like provoking a lion.

1154
01:19:17,596 --> 01:19:18,960
Let's go back.

1155
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,732
I'm very good at taming lions.
Don't be scared.

1156
01:19:23,812 --> 01:19:27,819
We might not have clothes
on our bodies when we return.

1157
01:19:38,048 --> 01:19:39,741
She's a beautiful girl.

1158
01:19:47,672 --> 01:19:51,680
'What is he doing here?
Why did he bring everyone?'

1159
01:19:53,483 --> 01:19:54,413
Why did you come here?

1160
01:19:54,493 --> 01:19:56,849
We came to talk to your mother.

1161
01:19:56,929 --> 01:19:59,904
Please go back.
She's very angry with Hari.

1162
01:19:59,984 --> 01:20:01,692
Shirisha! Shirisha!

1163
01:20:01,772 --> 01:20:03,989
Oh God! Mom is calling me.
Please leave.

1164
01:20:04,069 --> 01:20:05,456
Where are you?

1165
01:20:05,536 --> 01:20:07,349
I beg of you. Please leave.

1166
01:20:07,429 --> 01:20:08,517
- Shirisha!
- Hari, leave.

1167
01:20:09,772 --> 01:20:11,316
Where are you?

1168
01:20:15,766 --> 01:20:18,252
If the opening scene is like this,
what will be the climax?

1169
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:21,544
- Who are you?
- Hello! My name is Paidithalli.

1170
01:20:21,759 --> 01:20:23,779
I own the scrap shop
in the city center.

1171
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:25,639
All these boys work for me.

1172
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:27,942
I need to talk to you. Can I come in?

1173
01:20:28,022 --> 01:20:29,194
No need. Say it here.

1174
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:30,876
Give me the saree.

1175
01:20:31,685 --> 01:20:32,886
Coconut and bananas.

1176
01:20:33,766 --> 01:20:34,873
Give me the jasmines too.

1177
01:20:37,568 --> 01:20:40,398
His name is Hari Krishna.
He's a good guy.

1178
01:20:40,593 --> 01:20:42,820
He and your daughter love each other.

1179
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:46,201
I think we should give them
our blessing and get them married.

1180
01:20:46,281 --> 01:20:47,272
What do you say?

1181
01:20:47,459 --> 01:20:49,062
'How was it?'

1182
01:20:58,814 --> 01:21:00,392
'Why is he looking up?'

1183
01:21:00,472 --> 01:21:01,969
Give it to her.

1184
01:21:02,854 --> 01:21:07,065
What? How dare you
ask for my daughter's hand?

1185
01:21:07,193 --> 01:21:08,648
Scoundrel!
You collect scrap and sell it.

1186
01:21:08,728 --> 01:21:11,328
How dare you come here
for my daughter's hand?

1187
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:13,482
Who do you think you are?
Are you my brother?

1188
01:21:13,562 --> 01:21:15,409
Who are you to ask
for my daughter's hand?

1189
01:21:15,489 --> 01:21:19,239
What are you saying?
Have some humanity.

1190
01:21:19,319 --> 01:21:22,698
We came here because
they both are in love.

1191
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:23,866
Did you hear that?

1192
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:26,502
They came here because
you lead them on.

1193
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:27,753
- Mom!
- Come here!

1194
01:21:28,019 --> 01:21:31,638
- Please, mom! Let me go!
- She called you here, right?

1195
01:21:31,718 --> 01:21:33,154
I'll teach her a lesson right now!

1196
01:21:33,591 --> 01:21:36,995
You think you are old enough
to fall in love and get married?

1197
01:21:37,075 --> 01:21:41,136
Please stop her.
Madam, Please don't hit her.

1198
01:21:41,216 --> 01:21:42,874
- Who are you to stop me?
- Stop her, please.

1199
01:21:42,954 --> 01:21:45,092
Please tell her to stop.

1200
01:21:45,172 --> 01:21:47,229
Stop it! Are you a mother?

1201
01:21:48,276 --> 01:21:51,482
How can you hit a grown up girl?
Are you a mother?

1202
01:21:51,562 --> 01:21:52,683
I'll show you what I am!

1203
01:21:52,763 --> 01:21:54,460
Oh God, I'm dead!

1204
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:57,521
Boss! Boss!

1205
01:21:57,659 --> 01:22:00,288
Get up. Be careful.

1206
01:22:00,368 --> 01:22:03,293
Boss, get up. Are you okay?

1207
01:22:03,373 --> 01:22:04,610
Bring some water for him.

1208
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:09,066
Boss.. Drink some water.

1209
01:22:09,146 --> 01:22:10,539
Let's go inside.

1210
01:22:13,873 --> 01:22:14,949
Come on!

1211
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:16,087
Shirisha!

1212
01:22:17,868 --> 01:22:20,387
Brother, that's the guy. Kill him.

1213
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:21,439
Shirisha!

1214
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:34,525
You will die if you
say her name again.

1215
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:36,323
Shirisha!

1216
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:40,848
How dare you!

1217
01:22:40,928 --> 01:22:42,003
Shirisha!

1218
01:22:44,358 --> 01:22:46,163
How dare you say her name!

1219
01:22:46,243 --> 01:22:47,452
Shirisha!

1220
01:22:47,867 --> 01:22:49,223
Shirisha!

1221
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:51,061
Shirisha!

1222
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:53,153
Shirisha!

1223
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:02,185
Shirisha!

1224
01:23:02,265 --> 01:23:03,596
Move.

1225
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:04,803
Shirisha!

1226
01:23:05,651 --> 01:23:07,140
Shirisha!

1227
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,828
Move aside, uncle.

1228
01:23:09,587 --> 01:23:12,051
Have you gone mad?
Who asked you to come home?

1229
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:13,137
Who do you think you are?

1230
01:23:13,217 --> 01:23:15,737
If you come here again,
I will kill you myself. Get lost!

1231
01:23:15,817 --> 01:23:19,259
Go away! Leave!

1232
01:23:19,339 --> 01:23:21,528
Go away!

1233
01:23:21,992 --> 01:23:23,618
Go away!

1234
01:23:24,614 --> 01:23:27,105
I don't want to see your face again.
Get lost.

1235
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:32,689
- Come on, let's go inside.
- Mom!

1236
01:23:32,769 --> 01:23:35,858
You'll be dead if I
see you in this area again.

1237
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:46,085
Mom!

1238
01:23:46,846 --> 01:23:52,229
If you see him or meet him again,
I'll kill you myself.

1239
01:23:52,605 --> 01:23:55,442
I told you time and
again not to fall in love.

1240
01:23:55,522 --> 01:23:59,606
You are ruining your own life.

1241
01:24:11,887 --> 01:24:13,116
Hands off!

1242
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,851
Get your hands off her!

1243
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:25,637
I'll kill you all if you hurt her.

1244
01:24:30,979 --> 01:24:35,041
Why are you crying? Stop it.

1245
01:24:37,455 --> 01:24:44,169
Don't cry. I'm here for you.
Hari is here for you.

1246
01:24:59,562 --> 01:25:00,794
Move aside.

1247
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,374
Hari!

1248
01:25:44,614 --> 01:25:45,606
Hari!

1249
01:25:45,872 --> 01:25:47,494
He's lost.

1250
01:25:48,495 --> 01:25:51,984
Give it to me.
It's my turn. Now watch me.

1251
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,063
Hari, play with us.

1252
01:25:58,110 --> 01:25:59,516
Where are you going?

1253
01:26:00,169 --> 01:26:02,881
Saritha, I haven't Shirisha
in the past three days.

1254
01:26:02,961 --> 01:26:05,373
I don't know where she is.
Do you know anything?

1255
01:26:05,453 --> 01:26:07,620
She hasn't been coming
to the college since a week.

1256
01:26:07,946 --> 01:26:09,722
Oh okay. Where do you think she went?

1257
01:26:09,802 --> 01:26:10,912
I don't know.

1258
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:16,907
She said she doesn't
want to see you again.

1259
01:26:16,987 --> 01:26:18,922
So, why are you still
worried about her?

1260
01:26:19,155 --> 01:26:21,939
No, Shirisha will never do that to me.

1261
01:26:22,019 --> 01:26:23,450
Hari, that's how girls are.

1262
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:25,620
They are in love as long
as their parents don't know..

1263
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,369
..but once the parents know,
they do as they say.

1264
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:32,718
We searched everywhere,
but we didn't find her.

1265
01:26:32,798 --> 01:26:35,277
Her mother is a smart lady.
I'm sure she is hiding her somewhere.

1266
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:36,362
Idea!

1267
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:37,341
What's that?

1268
01:26:37,421 --> 01:26:39,330
- Let's file a complaint with
the police. - Saying what?

1269
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,089
That Shirisha is kidnapped
by her own mother.

1270
01:26:41,169 --> 01:26:44,163
- Please stop.
- Run. Serves you right.

1271
01:26:44,243 --> 01:26:47,170
Let's wait before her
house for a whole day.

1272
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,521
- We'll find some clue. What's say?
- Okay.

1273
01:26:57,357 --> 01:27:00,200
We might find Shirisha
if we follow him.

1274
01:27:08,667 --> 01:27:09,960
Come on, hurry.

1275
01:27:20,977 --> 01:27:23,018
I think this is the house.
Let's go to the backside.

1276
01:27:34,386 --> 01:27:38,425
[SONG ON TV]

1277
01:27:45,698 --> 01:27:46,986
Hari!

1278
01:27:47,264 --> 01:27:48,587
Hari!

1279
01:27:59,356 --> 01:28:03,109
Why did you come?
Will you never change? Go away.

1280
01:28:03,585 --> 01:28:07,257
My uncle will kill you.
Please forget me.

1281
01:28:07,337 --> 01:28:09,219
I can never forget you.

1282
01:28:09,299 --> 01:28:11,429
Please go. Forget me.

1283
01:28:11,509 --> 01:28:14,576
I can't, Shirisha. I can't.

1284
01:28:31,269 --> 01:28:32,575
Shall we elope?

1285
01:28:32,703 --> 01:28:34,457
- Oh God!
- Shall we elope?

1286
01:28:36,715 --> 01:28:40,767
Yes, let's elope.
I can't stay here another minute.

1287
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:42,948
Let's go. Let's run.

1288
01:28:44,404 --> 01:28:46,414
- Will you do as I say?
- What?

1289
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:58,823
Okay. Now see my acting prowess.

1290
01:28:58,903 --> 01:29:02,627
Uncle! Uncle!

1291
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:04,806
- How's my acting?
- Superb!

1292
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:06,057
Uncle!

1293
01:29:07,995 --> 01:29:10,057
How did you come here? You..

1294
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:11,074
Wait a minute, uncle.

1295
01:29:11,154 --> 01:29:12,361
How dare you come here?

1296
01:29:12,441 --> 01:29:14,257
Look at his arrogance, uncle.

1297
01:29:14,337 --> 01:29:17,273
Listen to me.
There's nothing between you and me.

1298
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,334
I'll kill you if you
try to meet me again.

1299
01:29:19,414 --> 01:29:21,722
My mom is more important to me.
I'll do as she says.

1300
01:29:21,802 --> 01:29:23,992
I'll kill you if you try
to meet me again. Get lost.

1301
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:26,902
Forget it. You have no heart.

1302
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:28,125
I can't believe that
I fell in love with you.

1303
01:29:28,205 --> 01:29:29,797
I was stupid to fall for you.

1304
01:29:29,877 --> 01:29:30,849
Now you know. Now leave.

1305
01:29:30,929 --> 01:29:33,700
- Will you stick to your word?
- Of course I will.

1306
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:36,849
- If you try to meet me again..
- That will never happen. Get lost.

1307
01:29:36,929 --> 01:29:40,552
- And don't try to call me too.
- Why will I call you? Leave!

1308
01:29:40,632 --> 01:29:41,718
- Get lost!
- Get lost!

1309
01:29:41,798 --> 01:29:42,942
- Let's go.
- Get lost!

1310
01:29:43,022 --> 01:29:43,982
Get lost!

1311
01:29:44,062 --> 01:29:46,196
- Get lost!
- Let's go.

1312
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:49,933
Get lost!
Go take selfies with dead bodies!

1313
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:57,355
Boss, this is for you.
Your favorite brand.

1314
01:29:58,628 --> 01:30:00,084
And here's 'Biryani' for you.

1315
01:30:00,164 --> 01:30:03,571
It has chicken, mutton,
fish and everything else. Enjoy.

1316
01:30:05,475 --> 01:30:08,254
- Let's have some beers!
- Cheers!

1317
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,577
He's drinking as if he doesn't care.

1318
01:30:13,657 --> 01:30:15,320
Why is he drinking like this?

1319
01:30:22,348 --> 01:30:24,133
Why are you sad? Drink up.

1320
01:30:24,213 --> 01:30:26,228
You are leaving in some time.
I wonder when we'll see you again.

1321
01:30:30,827 --> 01:30:32,673
Why are you laughing?

1322
01:30:32,753 --> 01:30:34,954
Do you want me to cry like you?

1323
01:30:35,236 --> 01:30:38,216
We've been best of friends.
Aren't you sad?

1324
01:30:38,296 --> 01:30:41,104
Sad? Not at all.
Shirisha is coming for me.

1325
01:30:41,184 --> 01:30:42,572
We both will live happily ever after.

1326
01:30:42,652 --> 01:30:44,565
- I'm on cloud nine, you know.
- What about us?

1327
01:30:44,645 --> 01:30:47,247
You are scrap.
You'll rot here. Go ahead and cry.

1328
01:30:47,327 --> 01:30:51,206
Don't beat me!
Don't beat me! Please stop!

1329
01:30:51,286 --> 01:30:55,916
Don't beat me! Don't beat me!

1330
01:30:58,124 --> 01:30:58,944
Hari!

1331
01:31:05,834 --> 01:31:07,140
What happened to you?

1332
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:11,971
Why are you crying?
We will be with you. Don't cry.

1333
01:31:12,481 --> 01:31:14,247
You are crying like a child.

1334
01:31:14,327 --> 01:31:15,597
Friends..

1335
01:31:15,677 --> 01:31:17,235
Why are you crying?

1336
01:31:18,275 --> 01:31:21,677
My friends..

1337
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:28,946
Hari!

1338
01:31:29,026 --> 01:31:31,213
- Boss..
- Don't be so sad. Get up.

1339
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:40,144
Why are you giving me this?

1340
01:31:40,224 --> 01:31:43,301
Love is not enough to live.
You need money too.

1341
01:32:05,657 --> 01:32:07,455
I started for the bus stand.

1342
01:32:09,464 --> 01:32:13,431
When I saw a police jeep I
got scared and took a different route.

1343
01:32:15,631 --> 01:32:17,012
Are you Hari?

1344
01:32:17,092 --> 01:32:19,975
Yes, it's me. Why did you stop me?

1345
01:32:20,055 --> 01:32:22,463
I'm getting late for my bus.
Let me go.

1346
01:32:22,543 --> 01:32:24,197
Please, sir. I have to go.

1347
01:32:24,339 --> 01:32:25,623
Sir..

1348
01:32:27,235 --> 01:32:29,423
- What are you doing?
- Sir..

1349
01:32:44,803 --> 01:32:47,709
I said I'm getting late. You rascals!

1350
01:32:56,226 --> 01:32:59,392
I escaped from them, went to the
bus stand and searched for Shirisha.

1351
01:33:00,068 --> 01:33:01,712
I couldn't find her.

1352
01:33:02,731 --> 01:33:04,712
I was so exhausted that I fell asleep.

1353
01:33:06,107 --> 01:33:07,883
When I woke up,
there was a big crowd before me.

1354
01:33:08,321 --> 01:33:10,973
I ran to the bathroom
to wash off the blood stains.

1355
01:33:11,053 --> 01:33:13,049
That's when you caught
me and brought me here.

1356
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:16,520
That's what really happened.
I don't know anything else.

1357
01:33:17,012 --> 01:33:23,485
Shirisha is my life.
Please save her. I beg of you.

1358
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:26,763
I can't live without her. Save her.

1359
01:33:36,227 --> 01:33:39,498
Sir, there are no
records of that incident.

1360
01:33:39,578 --> 01:33:42,348
Do you think they have been erased?

1361
01:33:42,428 --> 01:33:45,259
- Who can it be, sir?
- Our own men.

1362
01:33:45,339 --> 01:33:48,750
Nobody else has that talent. Let's go.

1363
01:33:56,394 --> 01:33:57,827
Adarsh Bank.

1364
01:34:42,222 --> 01:34:45,848
I liked you.
I said I love you, but you refused me.

1365
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:49,184
I said I'll make you my mistress,
but you refused.

1366
01:34:49,264 --> 01:34:52,717
I asked you to spend a night with me,
but you refused.

1367
01:34:52,797 --> 01:34:55,266
Now you are running
away with that scrap seller.

1368
01:34:55,346 --> 01:34:57,839
Do you think I'm a fool
to sit quietly and watch you go?

1369
01:34:59,035 --> 01:35:01,324
I've been observing you.

1370
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:06,825
You both will die
at the same time tonight.

1371
01:35:10,518 --> 01:35:12,320
Stop! I said stop!

1372
01:35:14,668 --> 01:35:15,748
Stop!

1373
01:35:35,274 --> 01:35:37,413
How dare you choose him over me!

1374
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:48,886
Stop! Copy this
footage in a pen drive.

1375
01:35:48,966 --> 01:35:50,447
Have you lost it?

1376
01:35:50,527 --> 01:35:51,909
Why do you want to
arrest the Mayor's son?

1377
01:35:51,989 --> 01:35:53,104
I've incriminating
evidence against him.

1378
01:35:53,184 --> 01:35:55,241
I don't care if he's a
mayor's son or a minister's son.

1379
01:35:55,321 --> 01:35:58,866
See the footage on this pen drive.
You'll understand.

1380
01:35:59,187 --> 01:36:02,598
This is not a short film to enjoy
watching it and bestow awards on it.

1381
01:36:02,678 --> 01:36:06,451
No matter what we do or who
we arrest we should have a solid plan.

1382
01:36:06,531 --> 01:36:09,152
We caught him red-handed.
We don't need any plans.

1383
01:36:09,232 --> 01:36:12,173
That day she barged into
the station and took her son.

1384
01:36:12,253 --> 01:36:15,002
Today I'll drag her son
to the station and lock him up.

1385
01:36:15,082 --> 01:36:17,172
That will show her the
power of our department.

1386
01:36:17,252 --> 01:36:20,166
Give me permission to arrest him.
I'll handle the rest.

1387
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:21,167
Okay, handle it.

1388
01:36:21,247 --> 01:36:23,752
If we have one sincere officer
like you in every station..

1389
01:36:23,832 --> 01:36:26,630
..we can erase corruption. Go ahead.

1390
01:36:37,878 --> 01:36:41,775
Sir, he's the auto driver
who testified against Hari.

1391
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,918
What did you understand?

1392
01:36:43,998 --> 01:36:46,100
I understood that from
today Rajeshwari Devi..

1393
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:47,380
..will use autos instead of her cars.

1394
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,032
- You fool!
- Sir.

1395
01:36:49,112 --> 01:36:52,472
They changed the CCTV camera
footage to sidetrack the case.

1396
01:36:52,552 --> 01:36:55,170
They can easily buy this
auto driver's testimony. Let's go.

1397
01:36:56,028 --> 01:36:57,093
Hello, sir!

1398
01:36:57,377 --> 01:36:59,072
I'll see you later.

1399
01:37:00,476 --> 01:37:01,514
Stop there!

1400
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:14,215
This is not a dance
club where you can waltz in.

1401
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:16,257
This is Mayor Rajeshwari
Devi's office.

1402
01:37:16,337 --> 01:37:17,978
- Get out.
- Sorry, madam.

1403
01:37:18,204 --> 01:37:20,323
When it comes to catching a criminal
we don't care if it is a club..

1404
01:37:20,403 --> 01:37:21,791
..a pub or a public place.

1405
01:37:21,871 --> 01:37:23,099
Who is a criminal here?

1406
01:37:23,179 --> 01:37:25,977
You are a criminal for stepping
into my office without my permission.

1407
01:37:26,057 --> 01:37:28,179
And you are a culprit
for not following protocols.

1408
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:31,075
That will be clear in a minute.
Call your son out.

1409
01:37:31,155 --> 01:37:32,182
Why should I?

1410
01:37:32,262 --> 01:37:35,907
We have solid evidence that
he stabbed a girl on the road.

1411
01:37:35,987 --> 01:37:37,639
Where did you find the said evidence?

1412
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:39,953
Did you find it according
to the rules of the constitution?

1413
01:37:40,033 --> 01:37:44,690
Or did you carve them into stones?

1414
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:46,456
Evidence, my foot.

1415
01:37:46,536 --> 01:37:50,181
Don't you watch TV or read newspapers?

1416
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:55,113
Many men who've raped
and murdered girls..

1417
01:37:55,262 --> 01:37:58,096
..got away with it very
easily with currency notes.

1418
01:37:58,176 --> 01:38:00,564
This case is not as
serious as those cases.

1419
01:38:00,866 --> 01:38:02,473
There are many cases where the truth..

1420
01:38:02,553 --> 01:38:05,286
..has been buried innocent
people have been framed..

1421
01:38:05,366 --> 01:38:07,485
..in false cases and given
years and years of prison sentences.

1422
01:38:07,565 --> 01:38:09,433
Do you have stronger
proofs than those cases?

1423
01:38:09,513 --> 01:38:13,306
Famous politicians have
been murdered in the disguise..

1424
01:38:13,386 --> 01:38:17,067
..of accidents, but there
is no evidence for those crimes.

1425
01:38:17,147 --> 01:38:17,946
Madam!

1426
01:38:18,026 --> 01:38:20,111
I'm not here to listen
to your political speeches.

1427
01:38:20,191 --> 01:38:21,150
Shut up!

1428
01:38:21,489 --> 01:38:24,686
You said you have
evidence to arrest my son.

1429
01:38:24,962 --> 01:38:26,351
Is this your evidence?

1430
01:38:28,712 --> 01:38:33,547
A fool like you wanted to
dig up a mountain with a needle.

1431
01:38:33,627 --> 01:38:36,443
Tell me the truth.
Where did you get that pen drive?

1432
01:38:36,523 --> 01:38:39,185
Shut up! How dare you interrogate me?

1433
01:38:39,265 --> 01:38:40,735
- Madam..
- Gangaram!

1434
01:38:44,087 --> 01:38:45,135
Sir, that pen drive.

1435
01:38:45,215 --> 01:38:46,555
Stop it, Gangaram.

1436
01:38:46,635 --> 01:38:49,032
Mrs. Rajeshwari Devi
is a law abiding citizen.

1437
01:38:49,112 --> 01:38:50,609
Is this how you respect her?

1438
01:38:50,689 --> 01:38:53,186
- Sir..
- Don't say another word.

1439
01:38:53,266 --> 01:38:55,860
Let's take this to my office.

1440
01:39:03,933 --> 01:39:06,595
Hari! Hari!

1441
01:39:06,675 --> 01:39:09,946
Yadigiri! Did you go to the hospital?

1442
01:39:10,026 --> 01:39:12,885
Did you see my Shirisha?
Is she out of danger?

1443
01:39:12,965 --> 01:39:14,757
Yes, she is recovering well.

1444
01:39:14,837 --> 01:39:15,821
She is fine, right?

1445
01:39:15,901 --> 01:39:17,008
She is fine. Right?

1446
01:39:17,478 --> 01:39:18,868
- Yes.
- Did she ask about me?

1447
01:39:18,948 --> 01:39:20,029
She asked about him, right?

1448
01:39:20,375 --> 01:39:21,128
Yes, she did.

1449
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:23,678
Of course she will.
I know my Shirisha.

1450
01:39:23,866 --> 01:39:26,045
Why is she crying?

1451
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:29,941
- Shirisha is hanging between life
and death. - What did he say?

1452
01:39:30,913 --> 01:39:32,728
They just dumped her here.

1453
01:39:32,808 --> 01:39:34,902
We need millions of
rupees for her treatment.

1454
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:41,358
The doctors said she won't survive.
Hari is responsible for this.

1455
01:39:51,261 --> 01:39:55,086
Look! Shirisha's condition
is very critical.

1456
01:39:55,166 --> 01:39:58,356
Her treatment will
cost a lot of money.

1457
01:39:58,436 --> 01:40:00,664
It has to be done
by specialist doctors.

1458
01:40:00,804 --> 01:40:04,690
Sir, Shirisha is my life. Save her.

1459
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:09,168
We'll definitely save her.
But you have to do as we say.

1460
01:40:09,248 --> 01:40:12,644
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

1461
01:40:12,724 --> 01:40:14,726
Everything you need to
do is written down in this.

1462
01:40:14,806 --> 01:40:16,297
Read it carefully and sign it.

1463
01:40:29,293 --> 01:40:31,474
Is this what you want?

1464
01:40:38,154 --> 01:40:38,814
Hello!

1465
01:40:38,894 --> 01:40:40,894
Congratulations in advance,
Rajeshwari Devi.

1466
01:40:41,156 --> 01:40:43,148
If our party wins
the elections this time..

1467
01:40:43,228 --> 01:40:45,070
..you will definitely
become the Home Minister.

1468
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:45,958
Really?

1469
01:40:46,038 --> 01:40:47,782
In the party High
Command meeting today..

1470
01:40:47,862 --> 01:40:49,496
..half of the members
nominated your name for it.

1471
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:50,744
Oh. Thank you, sir.

1472
01:40:50,824 --> 01:40:52,582
You've to be very alert from now on.

1473
01:40:52,662 --> 01:40:53,835
Apart from the opposition party..

1474
01:40:53,915 --> 01:40:56,057
..you have opposition
from our party members too.

1475
01:41:00,414 --> 01:41:01,750
I'll handle it.

1476
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:03,527
I'll take care of it, sir. Yes.

1477
01:41:03,744 --> 01:41:05,275
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

1478
01:41:10,102 --> 01:41:11,232
Hello, madam!

1479
01:41:11,543 --> 01:41:14,328
What is the status?
I don't want any obstacles.

1480
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:17,778
That won't be a problem.
We shut his mouth forever.

1481
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:21,663
He signed a statement
that he stabbed her.

1482
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:23,997
He agreed to do the
same in the court tomorrow.

1483
01:41:24,077 --> 01:41:25,872
- Did he say that in your ear?
- What do you mean, madam?

1484
01:41:25,952 --> 01:41:27,667
People say one thing
when they are hungry..

1485
01:41:27,747 --> 01:41:29,542
..and another thing after
they fill their stomachs.

1486
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,881
They say one thing
if you give them money..

1487
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:33,625
..and another thing
if you give them alcohol.

1488
01:41:33,705 --> 01:41:35,804
If everybody kept their word,
there wouldn't be..

1489
01:41:35,884 --> 01:41:39,208
..so many political parties
or scams worth billions.

1490
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:42,072
In fact, politicians
are corrupt because of them.

1491
01:41:42,152 --> 01:41:43,415
What do you want me to do, madam?

1492
01:41:43,495 --> 01:41:44,841
Listen carefully.

1493
01:41:45,395 --> 01:41:48,045
He shouldn't open
his mouth in the court..

1494
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:50,687
..and that girl shouldn't
open her eyes in the hospital.

1495
01:41:50,874 --> 01:41:53,890
End their lives before
they come out of the darkness.

1496
01:41:54,229 --> 01:41:55,246
Okay, madam.

1497
01:41:59,726 --> 01:42:01,268
Who is it at this hour?

1498
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:02,445
Oh, ACP sir.

1499
01:42:02,597 --> 01:42:04,112
Is your CI at the station?

1500
01:42:04,192 --> 01:42:05,710
- No, sir.
- Okay.

1501
01:42:05,987 --> 01:42:08,520
Kill that youth before
he comes to the station.

1502
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:09,689
Sir?

1503
01:42:12,435 --> 01:42:13,832
Okay, sir. I'll do it.

1504
01:42:37,399 --> 01:42:39,620
Hari, wake up.

1505
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:45,372
Will you have some tea?

1506
01:42:45,635 --> 01:42:46,390
What?

1507
01:42:46,529 --> 01:42:48,348
Constable, give him tea.

1508
01:42:49,587 --> 01:42:50,534
Here you go.

1509
01:42:50,936 --> 01:42:52,278
Give him biscuits too.

1510
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:54,465
Drink.

1511
01:42:55,371 --> 01:42:57,198
Why are you giving
me tea and biscuits?

1512
01:42:57,278 --> 01:42:59,177
- Today is the last day of your life.
- What?

1513
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:01,612
I mean, you'll be presented
at the court tomorrow.

1514
01:43:02,295 --> 01:43:05,353
This is your last
night at the station.

1515
01:43:05,491 --> 01:43:07,615
- Pull this up.
- Why are they tying ropes?

1516
01:43:07,695 --> 01:43:09,936
- Pull it up. Knot it there.
- What are they doing?

1517
01:43:10,016 --> 01:43:11,340
- Nothing. Drink your tea.
- I don't want it.

1518
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:14,087
- Make sure it is tight.
- Tie it well. Is it strong?

1519
01:43:14,167 --> 01:43:16,496
Sir, I confessed everything
and signed the papers.

1520
01:43:16,576 --> 01:43:17,624
Pull it up.

1521
01:43:17,898 --> 01:43:20,055
What is going on here?
What are they doing?

1522
01:43:20,504 --> 01:43:25,839
Please don't kill me.
I already confessed to everything.

1523
01:43:25,919 --> 01:43:29,215
Tie his hands.

1524
01:43:29,402 --> 01:43:34,114
What are you doing? Let me go!

1525
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:36,744
Let me go!

1526
01:43:37,139 --> 01:43:38,917
Hold him tight!

1527
01:43:40,655 --> 01:43:42,163
Catch him.

1528
01:43:55,848 --> 01:43:57,138
He's getting away.

1529
01:43:57,868 --> 01:44:00,053
Hey, stop!

1530
01:44:13,831 --> 01:44:15,198
'How will I find her?'

1531
01:44:55,682 --> 01:44:59,286
Look at me, Shirisha. Look at me.

1532
01:45:00,019 --> 01:45:02,102
Shirisha.. Shirisha..

1533
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:05,396
Look at me.. Please look at me..

1534
01:45:05,763 --> 01:45:10,274
Look at me, Shirisha. Look at me.

1535
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:15,802
Look at me, Shirisha. Look at me.

1536
01:45:15,882 --> 01:45:21,261
I came for you.
Look at me. I can't live without you.

1537
01:45:21,341 --> 01:45:25,516
I came for you.
Please look at me, Shirisha.

1538
01:45:25,596 --> 01:45:30,953
Please look at me just once.
Shirisha..

1539
01:46:29,999 --> 01:46:31,643
Hurry up.

1540
01:46:34,434 --> 01:46:36,198
This way. Hurry up.

1541
01:46:37,001 --> 01:46:39,603
Hari! Come on, let's go.

1542
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,207
Come on, hurry up.

1543
01:46:45,732 --> 01:46:47,829
Shirisha! Shirisha!

1544
01:46:47,981 --> 01:46:49,254
Pick her up. Come on.

1545
01:46:50,493 --> 01:46:51,565
Pick her up.

1546
01:46:53,163 --> 01:46:54,589
Come on.

1547
01:46:54,669 --> 01:46:59,143
Hari, hurry up. Get in.

1548
01:46:59,223 --> 01:47:02,149
You guys go home. Take care. Bye.

1549
01:47:02,663 --> 01:47:03,645
We'll be safe. Don't worry.

1550
01:47:03,725 --> 01:47:06,074
Don't worry.

1551
01:47:06,399 --> 01:47:07,977
Bye. Bye.

1552
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:09,194
Bye.

1553
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,618
Shirisha!

1554
01:47:17,463 --> 01:47:19,668
Hari!

1555
01:47:23,172 --> 01:47:25,171
Shirisha!

1556
01:47:29,388 --> 01:47:30,429
Hari!

1557
01:47:30,556 --> 01:47:32,942
Stop right there!

1558
01:47:34,521 --> 01:47:38,037
Don't beat me.

1559
01:47:41,707 --> 01:47:42,580
Hari!

1560
01:47:44,213 --> 01:47:47,300
Shirisha! Shirisha!

1561
01:47:48,062 --> 01:47:49,174
Hari!

1562
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,846
Rascals!

1563
01:48:12,046 --> 01:48:13,243
Hari!

1564
01:48:44,973 --> 01:48:46,390
Hari!

1565
01:49:29,573 --> 01:49:32,141
Hari, come on!

1566
01:49:34,071 --> 01:49:35,214
Shirisha!

1567
01:49:37,809 --> 01:49:38,655
Careful.

1568
01:49:38,779 --> 01:49:40,660
Come on, get in.

1569
01:49:42,391 --> 01:49:43,808
Shirisha!

1570
01:49:44,175 --> 01:49:47,076
Hari, be careful. Come on, go.

1571
01:49:47,156 --> 01:49:51,229
Come on! Hurry up!

1572
01:49:51,309 --> 01:49:55,928
Start the engine. Go, go, go.

1573
01:49:56,008 --> 01:49:57,483
Bye, Hari.

1574
01:49:57,563 --> 01:50:00,023
Run!

1575
01:50:00,472 --> 01:50:01,676
Darn!

1576
01:50:03,032 --> 01:50:04,574
Bye, Hari.

1577
01:50:14,974 --> 01:50:17,288
Why isn't it moving forward?
Get down and check.

1578
01:50:20,055 --> 01:50:21,893
That fatso is clinging to the tire.

1579
01:50:21,973 --> 01:50:23,237
Drag him away.

1580
01:50:23,708 --> 01:50:25,894
No! I won't let you go!

1581
01:50:57,732 --> 01:50:59,077
I'll protect you, Shirisha.

1582
01:50:59,157 --> 01:51:00,660
Aren't you tired?

1583
01:51:03,389 --> 01:51:05,736
Does anyone feel that their
heart is a burden to them?

1584
01:51:05,816 --> 01:51:07,507
Why do you love me so much?

1585
01:51:07,587 --> 01:51:10,396
I don't have anybody.
I never experienced mother's love.

1586
01:51:10,589 --> 01:51:11,884
I never saw my father.

1587
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:16,091
I don't know where I was born
or how I grew up. I'm just an orphan.

1588
01:51:16,171 --> 01:51:19,652
But after seeing you,
I didn't feel lonely anymore.

1589
01:51:19,732 --> 01:51:23,786
God took away my family but he
compensated it by sending you to me.

1590
01:51:24,229 --> 01:51:26,010
He asked me to shower
all my love on you.

1591
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:30,970
My love is yours.
My life is yours. My breath is yours.

1592
01:51:31,783 --> 01:51:35,623
I'm living for you, Shirisha.

1593
01:51:35,703 --> 01:51:39,188
I like you.
I'm crazy about you. I love you.

1594
01:52:01,968 --> 01:52:08,104
"I like you.
You stole my little heart."

1595
01:52:08,184 --> 01:52:14,162
"You made me go crazy for you,
darling."

1596
01:52:14,242 --> 01:52:20,284
"You called to me
and pulled my heart."

1597
01:52:20,364 --> 01:52:26,327
"You made me love you
more than my life, darling."

1598
01:52:26,407 --> 01:52:32,416
"My eyes are for you only,
my words are for you only."

1599
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:38,691
"I'll walk with you
and savor your smiles."

1600
01:52:38,771 --> 01:52:47,739
"I just need you."

1601
01:52:47,819 --> 01:52:53,656
"I like you.
You stole my little heart."

1602
01:52:53,736 --> 01:53:00,047
"You made me go crazy for you,
darling."

1603
01:53:15,193 --> 01:53:21,308
"You made me dream of you
and forget the whole world."

1604
01:53:21,388 --> 01:53:27,319
"My heart is racing for you."

1605
01:53:27,399 --> 01:53:33,548
"My mind is constantly
filled with your thoughts."

1606
01:53:33,628 --> 01:53:39,550
"I don't want to stop it."

1607
01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:48,448
"I just need you."

1608
01:53:48,528 --> 01:53:54,460
"I like you.
You stole my little heart."

1609
01:53:54,540 --> 01:54:00,979
"You made me go crazy for you,
darling."

1610
01:54:22,134 --> 01:54:28,214
"I won't lose you
until my last breath."

1611
01:54:28,294 --> 01:54:33,853
"I'll stay with you till the end."

1612
01:54:34,009 --> 01:54:40,274
"I'll make the same promise to you."

1613
01:54:40,354 --> 01:54:46,394
"I'll be with you forever
until my last breath."

1614
01:54:46,474 --> 01:54:56,070
"I just need you."

1615
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:16,442
Hari, stop!

1616
01:55:17,499 --> 01:55:18,519
Stop!

1617
01:55:18,599 --> 01:55:19,627
I said stop!

1618
01:55:19,707 --> 01:55:20,673
Stop!

1619
01:55:20,753 --> 01:55:21,805
Siri..

1620
01:55:21,885 --> 01:55:23,223
Hurry up.

1621
01:55:25,161 --> 01:55:26,744
Hari, stop!

1622
01:55:35,575 --> 01:55:37,659
Siri.. Siri..

1623
01:55:38,290 --> 01:55:40,989
Siri, get up.

1624
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:46,593
I can't run anymore, Hari. Let's die.

1625
01:55:46,673 --> 01:55:47,950
Let's go somewhere and die.

1626
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:50,018
We didn't come this far to die.

1627
01:55:50,098 --> 01:55:51,542
They won't let us live.

1628
01:55:51,622 --> 01:55:54,050
I'd rather kill myself
than die in their hands.

1629
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:56,666
Let's die together in peace.

1630
01:55:56,746 --> 01:56:02,904
No, Siri. We should live.
I'll live and I'll save you.

1631
01:56:02,984 --> 01:56:04,234
Come on.

1632
01:56:05,747 --> 01:56:09,347
Hair, stop! It is for your own good.

1633
01:56:09,427 --> 01:56:11,165
You didn't do any good to us.

1634
01:56:11,245 --> 01:56:13,513
We can't trust you with our lives.

1635
01:56:13,593 --> 01:56:15,822
Your lives are in our hands even now.

1636
01:56:15,902 --> 01:56:19,268
If you don't do as I say,
I'll shoot you right here.

1637
01:56:20,403 --> 01:56:21,995
Go ahead, shoot us.

1638
01:56:22,075 --> 01:56:25,038
We didn't fall in
love to die like this.

1639
01:56:25,118 --> 01:56:27,791
Since you are not letting
us live in peace in the city..

1640
01:56:27,871 --> 01:56:29,866
..we thought we can
live here in the forest.

1641
01:56:29,946 --> 01:56:31,223
Won't you let us live here as well?

1642
01:56:31,303 --> 01:56:34,909
Stop your nonsense!
You are just a scrap seller.

1643
01:56:34,989 --> 01:56:37,986
You don't deserve
a lover or a love story.

1644
01:56:38,066 --> 01:56:41,197
I deserve it. Aren't we human beings?

1645
01:56:41,277 --> 01:56:43,765
Don't we have hearts?
Aren't we capable of love?

1646
01:56:43,845 --> 01:56:46,943
Yes, I collect scrap to earn a living.

1647
01:56:47,023 --> 01:56:50,839
But now I know that
you are the real scrap.

1648
01:56:51,663 --> 01:56:53,833
Hari, you'll die.

1649
01:56:53,971 --> 01:56:55,543
Go ahead, kill me.

1650
01:56:55,623 --> 01:57:00,763
People in love die for love,
they don't kill for love.

1651
01:57:01,432 --> 01:57:04,720
Love knows giving, not taking.

1652
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:09,098
I won't die if you kill me.
I'll live. I'll live at least one day.

1653
01:57:09,178 --> 01:57:11,676
I'll live to announce
our love to the world.

1654
01:57:11,756 --> 01:57:14,040
I'll live to expose your
true colors to the world.

1655
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:17,194
Maybe you are planning
to kill us and bury us here..

1656
01:57:17,274 --> 01:57:20,533
..but we'll die amidst people,
before everyone.

1657
01:57:20,613 --> 01:57:23,404
Our deaths will make history,
they won't be a mystery.

1658
01:57:23,484 --> 01:57:26,836
Our deaths will make history.

1659
01:57:33,344 --> 01:57:34,468
Let's go, Shirisha.

1660
01:57:38,105 --> 01:57:39,333
Why did you come back?

1661
01:57:39,413 --> 01:57:40,202
Why should we run?

1662
01:57:40,282 --> 01:57:41,697
Why should we be scared of anyone?

1663
01:57:41,777 --> 01:57:44,381
Even dry grass will
catch fire if you light it.

1664
01:57:44,461 --> 01:57:46,711
I'm a human being.
I have some pride too.

1665
01:57:46,791 --> 01:57:48,670
Can't I threaten those
who are threatening me?

1666
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:51,227
So I decided to go
there and face them.

1667
01:57:51,307 --> 01:57:52,832
Hari, that's a rash decision.

1668
01:57:52,912 --> 01:57:55,511
If I delay, it will be
like giving them another chance.

1669
01:57:55,591 --> 01:58:00,452
If I live, my love will live. If I die
you will have to help lovers like me.

1670
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:03,635
- Hari.. - Use photos, videos,
whatever you want to use.

1671
01:58:03,856 --> 01:58:07,153
Everybody should know
how much we suffered for love.

1672
01:58:07,233 --> 01:58:09,034
Even a poor lover deserves to dream.

1673
01:58:09,114 --> 01:58:11,652
People should realize that
even dumpsters have love stories.

1674
01:58:11,732 --> 01:58:14,173
If you can do that, I'm ready to die.

1675
01:58:14,253 --> 01:58:15,744
Go ahead then, go die.

1676
01:58:15,824 --> 01:58:17,523
We cannot help those who want to die.

1677
01:58:17,603 --> 01:58:18,491
Won't you do what I asked you to do?

1678
01:58:18,571 --> 01:58:20,136
What should we do? You fell
in love and now you want to die.

1679
01:58:20,216 --> 01:58:21,315
Where do we fit in?

1680
01:58:21,395 --> 01:58:25,181
You have nothing to do with it?
You don't? Tell me!

1681
01:58:25,261 --> 01:58:26,227
Hari, no!

1682
01:58:26,307 --> 01:58:28,602
- Are you saying you are not my friend?
- Stop it!

1683
01:58:28,682 --> 01:58:31,719
Hit me. Hit me, go ahead. Kill me too.

1684
01:58:31,799 --> 01:58:34,142
I'd rather die in your
hands than do what you ask.

1685
01:58:34,222 --> 01:58:35,420
What are you talking about?

1686
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:38,219
Did I take those
beatings to see you die?

1687
01:58:38,299 --> 01:58:41,269
Did I do this to put garlands
on your funeral pyres?

1688
01:58:41,349 --> 01:58:43,327
We'll come with you,
we'll die with you.

1689
01:58:43,407 --> 01:58:45,585
Please try to understand me.

1690
01:58:45,665 --> 01:58:47,661
You don't have to do anything for me.

1691
01:58:47,741 --> 01:58:51,328
If you make my story known to others
you'll be helping many guys like me.

1692
01:58:51,408 --> 01:58:53,210
It will be like giving
them your blessing.

1693
01:58:53,290 --> 01:58:56,412
Please. This is my last wish.
Don't refuse me.

1694
01:58:56,492 --> 01:58:57,739
But we..

1695
01:59:08,094 --> 01:59:11,623
"Fight back with courage to win."

1696
01:59:12,072 --> 01:59:15,920
"Make your love victorious."

1697
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,215
"Fight back with courage to win."

1698
01:59:19,379 --> 01:59:23,585
"Make your love victorious."

1699
01:59:23,665 --> 01:59:27,393
"Make your love victorious."

1700
01:59:27,473 --> 01:59:31,953
"Make your love victorious."

1701
01:59:32,265 --> 01:59:33,863
He is Hari, madam.

1702
01:59:33,943 --> 01:59:36,146
You don't know me,
you've never seen me.

1703
01:59:36,226 --> 01:59:37,681
Why are you doing all this, madam?

1704
01:59:38,007 --> 01:59:39,795
Your son stabbed this girl.

1705
01:59:41,145 --> 01:59:46,498
You asked me to take the blame
for it in order to save her life.

1706
01:59:46,578 --> 01:59:47,530
But what did you do?

1707
01:59:47,610 --> 01:59:50,638
You sent policemen to
kill me in the jail cell.

1708
01:59:51,594 --> 01:59:54,341
You sent doctors to
kill her in the hospital.

1709
01:59:55,683 --> 01:59:58,582
Will politicians, doctors
and policemen kill everyone else?

1710
01:59:58,662 --> 01:59:59,842
Is this your kingdom?

1711
01:59:59,922 --> 02:00:03,198
Will you decide when
we live and when we die?

1712
02:00:03,278 --> 02:00:05,578
You are talking too much!

1713
02:00:05,841 --> 02:00:09,038
Even prominent people
are afraid to talk before me.

1714
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:13,140
You are just a piece
of junk from the scrap yard.

1715
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:14,725
How dare you lecture me!

1716
02:00:14,805 --> 02:00:17,084
A piece of junk should
be left in the scrap yard, madam.

1717
02:00:17,164 --> 02:00:21,100
If you step on it, you'll
septic your foot and lose your leg.

1718
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:22,114
Shut up!

1719
02:00:22,194 --> 02:00:24,148
I've seen hundreds of men like you.

1720
02:00:24,228 --> 02:00:26,328
But this is the first
time you are seeing me.

1721
02:00:27,372 --> 02:00:30,824
No matter how powerful you are,
you will fall one day.

1722
02:00:30,904 --> 02:00:34,126
- Are you threatening me?
- You've been threatening us till now.

1723
02:00:34,206 --> 02:00:35,773
If God blessed the
lion with sharp claws..

1724
02:00:35,853 --> 02:00:37,593
..he also provided domestic
animals with horns.

1725
02:00:37,673 --> 02:00:39,965
Those horns are enough
to pull the claws out.

1726
02:00:40,045 --> 02:00:42,241
Kill him!

1727
02:01:31,531 --> 02:01:33,298
You are the one who
is committing crimes.

1728
02:01:33,378 --> 02:01:35,746
Don't make me take the blame for them.

1729
02:01:43,606 --> 02:01:45,698
Why do you want to kill me, madam?

1730
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:48,554
Did I convince your daughter
to run away with me?

1731
02:01:48,705 --> 02:01:52,424
My life or love life
shouldn't concern you.

1732
02:01:52,695 --> 02:01:56,508
Did rich people make a
rule that poor people can't love?

1733
02:01:56,976 --> 02:02:00,939
Do you think poor girls are born
to satisfy the desires of rich guys?

1734
02:02:01,906 --> 02:02:05,032
Will you kill people
like me when we refuse?

1735
02:02:05,343 --> 02:02:06,795
Come on, kill me.

1736
02:02:20,809 --> 02:02:23,556
Who are you to decide my death?

1737
02:02:23,908 --> 02:02:28,627
I'll live. I'll live at least
for a day for my love, for Shirisha.

1738
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,134
Love gives me the courage to live.

1739
02:02:33,116 --> 02:02:36,465
You are powerful,
but please don't play with our lives.

1740
02:02:36,545 --> 02:02:37,918
We can't win against you.

1741
02:02:37,998 --> 02:02:40,451
You can't live if you fight with us.

1742
02:02:41,364 --> 02:02:46,082
Stop your games right now. Stop them.

1743
02:02:46,374 --> 02:02:49,972
"Make your love victorious."

1744
02:02:50,052 --> 02:02:53,936
"Make your love victorious."

1745
02:02:54,016 --> 02:02:57,887
Stop! Stop right there!

1746
02:03:01,823 --> 02:03:03,664
Where do you think you are going?

1747
02:03:03,744 --> 02:03:07,269
You think you can come here
to threaten us and go back alive?

1748
02:03:07,349 --> 02:03:10,500
You can leave if you want,
I'll spare your life.

1749
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:12,568
But leave her here.

1750
02:03:12,724 --> 02:03:13,783
Come with me.

1751
02:03:30,768 --> 02:03:32,113
Come on!

1752
02:04:15,138 --> 02:04:16,971
Hello!

1753
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:40,463
Hari!

1754
02:05:03,029 --> 02:05:03,676
Hari!

1755
02:05:03,756 --> 02:05:06,956
Hari! Hari! Hari! Come with me!

1756
02:05:07,036 --> 02:05:08,523
- Come.
- Let me go!

1757
02:05:08,603 --> 02:05:09,884
Hari!

1758
02:05:10,797 --> 02:05:14,710
You hurt my ego by saying
'I love you' to him before me.

1759
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:16,925
You insulted me by throwing
me in the garbage bags.

1760
02:05:17,453 --> 02:05:18,837
Hari..

1761
02:05:19,849 --> 02:05:22,530
Go ahead, tell him that you love him.

1762
02:05:23,771 --> 02:05:26,838
But sleep with me. Come on.

1763
02:05:27,574 --> 02:05:30,906
I won't let you leave
without satisfying my desires.

1764
02:05:33,444 --> 02:05:34,750
Hari!

1765
02:05:36,307 --> 02:05:37,786
Hari!

1766
02:05:37,866 --> 02:05:44,307
[SANSKRIT SHLOK]

1767
02:05:48,599 --> 02:05:49,685
Come on!

1768
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:56,798
Rahul!

1769
02:06:19,265 --> 02:06:21,694
Stop!

1770
02:06:27,161 --> 02:06:30,447
ACP, what are you waiting for?
Shoot them!

1771
02:06:32,530 --> 02:06:34,550
Come on, shoot them!

1772
02:06:39,697 --> 02:06:40,874
Hari!

1773
02:06:41,877 --> 02:06:43,267
Hari!

1774
02:06:43,481 --> 02:06:46,062
No, wait here!

1775
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:48,560
Hari..

1776
02:06:53,086 --> 02:06:54,248
Hari..

1777
02:07:10,779 --> 02:07:12,606
It's gone viral on Facebook.

1778
02:07:22,977 --> 02:07:25,959
People who've seen
Mayor Rajeshwari Devi..

1779
02:07:26,039 --> 02:07:28,595
..ordering the police to
shoot Hari Krishna and Shirisha..

1780
02:07:28,675 --> 02:07:31,293
..to save her son from prison,
are raging with anger.

1781
02:07:31,373 --> 02:07:32,898
Will they shoot
everyone who is in love?

1782
02:07:32,978 --> 02:07:34,020
That's what it looks like.

1783
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:35,217
Can't poor people fall in love?

1784
02:07:35,297 --> 02:07:37,583
Why not? How can it be wrong to love?

1785
02:07:37,663 --> 02:07:39,609
Is it wrong for poor
people to fall in love?

1786
02:07:39,689 --> 02:07:41,657
If poor people fall in love,
will rich people kill them?

1787
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:43,000
Our society has gone to the dogs.

1788
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:45,614
How can they kill people
for falling in love?

1789
02:07:45,694 --> 02:07:48,195
Warn your son. He says he's in love.

1790
02:07:48,275 --> 02:07:49,344
They might shoot him too.

1791
02:07:49,424 --> 02:07:50,963
Will they kill everyone
who is in love?

1792
02:07:53,143 --> 02:07:54,762
Get up, Shirisha.

1793
02:08:05,161 --> 02:08:06,400
Hari..

1794
02:08:11,762 --> 02:08:12,862
Hari..

1795
02:08:28,141 --> 02:08:29,421
What took you so long?

1796
02:08:29,501 --> 02:08:31,976
We came here to arrest you,
not to protect you.

1797
02:08:32,056 --> 02:08:33,588
What rubbish?

1798
02:08:33,668 --> 02:08:36,382
Lower your voice.
Everything that happened here..

1799
02:08:36,462 --> 02:08:37,998
..is being telecast
live in the news channels.

1800
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:40,805
You insulted him for
being a scrap seller.

1801
02:08:40,885 --> 02:08:44,866
He dragged your status
and power to the dumpsters.

1802
02:09:00,556 --> 02:09:02,095
- Oh God!
- Naresh!

1803
02:09:03,945 --> 02:09:07,045
Powerful people are behind
bars for attacking people in love.

1804
02:09:07,190 --> 02:09:09,548
We'll suffer the same fate.
It will become a big issue.

1805
02:09:09,628 --> 02:09:11,633
Don't kill them. Let them go.

1806
02:09:11,713 --> 02:09:13,176
Okay, boss.

1807
02:09:17,051 --> 02:09:24,012
"I won't lose you
until my last breath."

1808
02:09:24,092 --> 02:09:30,273
"I'll stay with you till the end."

1809
02:09:30,875 --> 02:09:37,448
"I'll make the same promise to you."

1810
02:09:37,676 --> 02:09:44,290
"I'll be with you forever
until my last breath."

1811
02:09:46,518 --> 02:09:48,995
- Hari!
- Hari!

1812
02:09:49,459 --> 02:09:50,787
Hari!

1813
02:09:50,867 --> 02:09:53,783
All the love stories in
the world start in the same way.

1814
02:09:54,517 --> 02:09:56,510
But they end very differently.

1815
02:09:57,237 --> 02:10:00,592
When a love story ends with happiness,
nobody notices it.

1816
02:10:01,118 --> 02:10:05,511
But if a love story fails,
it will be remembered forever.

1817
02:10:06,675 --> 02:10:09,263
The couple in this love
story lost their lives.

1818
02:10:09,888 --> 02:10:12,973
But their story gave a
new life to many love stories.

1819
02:10:13,302 --> 02:10:15,766
It helps many couples
to face the world with courage.

1820
02:10:16,401 --> 02:10:18,189
If you refuse love,
there will be a great storm.

1821
02:10:18,654 --> 02:10:22,138
But if you accept it,
love fills the whole world.

1822
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:34,691
"I like you.
You stole my little heart."

1823
02:10:34,771 --> 02:10:40,667
"You made me go crazy for you,
darling."

1824
02:10:40,747 --> 02:10:46,826
"I like you.
You stole my little heart."

1825
02:10:46,906 --> 02:10:52,864
"You made me go crazy for you,
darling."

1826
02:10:52,944 --> 02:10:58,918
"My eyes are for you only,
my words are for you only."

1827
02:10:58,998 --> 02:11:05,281
"I'll walk with you
and savor your smiles."

1828
02:11:05,361 --> 02:11:15,122
"I just need you."
