1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,840
'He is beyond caste, community,
region or religion'

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,120
'That is the sole reason
he is 'Bhishma' of Telugu cinema'

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,640
'My guru
My God'

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,480
'This film is a tribute to the great legend
Darshaka Ratna Dasari Narayana Rao'

5
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,160
'Gayatri'

6
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
'Your Honor'

7
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,680
'He set a hospital on fire
just to finish off his enemy'

8
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,800
'This Gayatri Patel was responsible
for the death of 132 people'

9
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,760
'After all that has happened
the accused shows no remorse'

10
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,360
'And if he's let out into this world'

11
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,040
'...it will be truly dangerous!'

12
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,240
'Therefore...'

13
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,760
'...Gayatri Patel is pronounced guilty'

14
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
'As per section 302...'

15
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,280
'...will be sentenced to death'

16
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,640
'Gayatri Patel, who was responsible
for the death of 132 people...'

17
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,840
'...has been sentenced to death'

18
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,480
Do you expect Subbarami Reddy award
instead of death sentence for murder?

19
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,880
I've invested heaps of borrowed money
on this channel by paying interest

20
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,280
What's the point of showing
news of no interest?

21
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
At least one piece of news

22
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,400
It's annoying if news isn't interesting
Or if a heroine is refusing to 'show off'

23
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,720
- What's news?
- MLAs are hitting each other

24
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,280
What's the interest in
MLAs fighting with each other?

25
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,760
If MLAs beat the public,
that will be of interest

26
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,920
Get lost!

27
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,720
Father is calling her from home
and she isn't picking up

28
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,360
Godfather is here in person
Even then she isn't noticing

29
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
If she's concentrating
this much on her work...

30
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
...it must be a very interesting article

31
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,720
Sreshta...?

32
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,160
What is this article?

33
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,640
Tell me...tell me

34
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,920
Writing an article about an actor, sir

35
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,640
It will hold everyone's interest
if you write about Sunny Leone

36
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
Who will be interested in
reading about a stage artiste?

37
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,920
He isn't an ordinary artiste

38
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
A very different actor

39
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,840
Considered to be an authority
in historical, social, contemporary drama

40
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,280
'He has acted in various roles'

41
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,840
'Whatever role he enacts...'

42
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,200
...he will completely
transform into that character!

43
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,800
Transmigrate...?

44
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
He's just a foot away from death!

45
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,440
What, Sreshta?

46
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,240
An actor should be a foot away
from the Mother of Arts

47
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
But why is he
on the brink of death?

48
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
Tell me

49
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
Who is he?

50
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,640
His name is Dasari Sivaji

51
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,880
'Sarada Sadan'

52
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,440
"He has a heart like jasmine
Virtuous and pure within"

53
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,800
"He is as rejuvenating always
as the sun's early morning rays"

54
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,080
"He is like the moon shining radiant
Like a child's laughter innocent"

55
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,400
"The scorching sun's rays
as cool moon light he displaces"

56
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,800
"He is the favorite of people
So ami(c)able and affable"

57
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,320
"So many in his life; however
you can call him a loner"

58
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,640
"He has a heart like jasmine
Spotless white and sublime"

59
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,840
"He is energetic always
Like the sun's early morning rays"

60
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:20,440
"A mixture of childlike quality; guileless
Entwined with an endearing freshness"

61
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:28,240
"Whichever side he steps out
he won't cross his limits; no doubt"

62
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,320
"He is like everyone else, ordinary
But a friend extraordinary"

63
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,680
"Stuck between strife and burning fire
he is a common man with a fatherly desire"

64
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,160
"He has a heart like jasmine
Shining pure within"

65
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,000
"He is as energetic in all ways
as the sun's early morning rays"

66
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:34,160
"Neither a bend in the road nor exhaustion
can make this traveller halt his mission"

67
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:42,160
"He learnt his life's lesson
experiencing this marathon"

68
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,800
"To combat curses, like how lights dance
he swims against the tide with brilliance"

69
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,360
"He never loses his identity
by giving up his dignity"

70
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
Lucky, come

71
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,000
Thank you so much

72
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,640
For bringing our child back

73
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,280
This baby is so lucky

74
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,760
I reunited her with her parents
without any hassle

75
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
Sivaji

76
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,000
Reuniting missing children
with their parents

77
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
You've been doing this noble service

78
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,480
When will God unite you with your child
living somewhere you're oblivious of?

79
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,560
Prasad

80
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,000
Life is like a game of chess

81
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
We play with God

82
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,560
Our moves are based on sins

83
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,480
God's moves are based on our 'karma'

84
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,880
Wonder when I'll get the returns!

85
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,440
Hey, got your visa?

86
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,920
He didn't return my passport
So as good as got

87
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Hey, stop
Stop the vehicle

88
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,440
Sivaji sir, is that you?

89
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,840
Please carry on

90
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,120
Hey, stop the vehicle

91
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,720
Weekend collection is weak
Why is he letting him go?

92
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,120
You can even stop the Governor's convoy

93
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,120
But not this 2-wheeler

94
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,720
Who is he?
Your relative?

95
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,880
Trust me, sir
I know him very well

96
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,720
Check with the breathalyzer

97
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,440
If you do this
it will make matter worse

98
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,320
Are you showing a lack of discipline?

99
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,480
Discipline will take lessons from him!

100
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,440
First of all he's a stage artiste

101
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,040
He can enact any role

102
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,480
There's a 2nd page too

103
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,480
He'll show his personal character

104
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
What the hell can he show?

105
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm a voracious reader

106
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,520
I read each and every page

107
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
If I find anything amiss
I'll tear it to pieces

108
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,680
Blow

109
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,400
Sir, church bell is an omen

110
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,400
Don't do this, sir

111
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,560
Shut up
You blow please

112
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I'm not drunk, sir

113
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,720
Machine will find that out, you blow

114
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
No beep

115
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,040
Before my blood pressure
shoots up, leave now

116
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,480
2nd page I believe

117
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,800
2nd page

118
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,320
Circle Inspector, sir

119
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,360
- What...?
- Please come here

120
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,440
Can you also blow for me once?

121
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,560
I had just a quarter
when I was in my quarters

122
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,000
Why should I blow?

123
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
You checked to see
if I was driving drunk

124
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I fear you're intoxicated
during your duty hours

125
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,480
It's okay, just blow into it once

126
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,000
Who are you to ask me to blow?

127
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
Public, sir

128
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,440
Public...?

129
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,400
Who should be the Chief Minister?

130
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,720
Who should be
the Prime Minister of India?

131
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,200
That will be decided
by the votes our fingers imprint

132
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,040
- Please blow once
- He's booked!

133
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,400
Should he blow or no need?

134
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,080
- Blow
- He has to blow!

135
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,720
He has opened the 2nd page!

136
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,480
It's nothing

137
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,000
Blow only once

138
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,160
Prasad!

139
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,520
What happened?

140
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,440
Sivaji, in the name of land conservation
Khadar's henchmen locked our home

141
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,640
Bashed us up and
left us bleeding

142
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Sir...?

143
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,520
There are 3 harvests in a year

144
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,240
We know nothing other than farming

145
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,520
For generations we've been dependent
on this land for our livelihood

146
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,480
Please don't take it away

147
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,360
You've been enjoying
for generations, right?

148
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,160
We have to enjoy as well, right?

149
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,320
Will you sign or die?

150
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,240
'I'll sign'

151
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,680
I'll sign now

152
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,920
Police?!

153
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
Politicians?!

154
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,040
If you grab these lands officially
then it's land accumulation

155
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,320
But if we unofficially grab it,
it's rowdyism!

156
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,400
Whatever the case may be
you grab the farmers' lands

157
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,840
...under the pretext of construction
but real estate is your real motive

158
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,000
Farmer brother
You wait here

159
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Brother

160
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,320
Greetings, anna

161
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,320
In those days farmers were honored
with paddy as symbol on our coins

162
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,480
Now paddy in the same coins
has been replaced with a thumb

163
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,800
Our men in power now say they will
loot the farmers without caring two hoots

164
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,160
Please return his land

165
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,320
Who are you?

166
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,720
Sir, he's the 2nd page person
I told you about

167
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,440
I got suspended because of him

168
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,280
So you are the one

169
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,000
What do you do?

170
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Actor, anna

171
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,680
I enact different roles on stage

172
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,160
Actor...?
What's this?

173
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,560
Why are you here?

174
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,640
To act like I'm scared when I see you

175
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,240
Pretend you're scared?

176
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,040
Does it mean you don't fear me?

177
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,800
No, anna

178
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,480
I'll act like I am terrified

179
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,080
I hold no respect for you

180
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
But I'll act like I hold you in high regard

181
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,520
When I see you somewhere...

182
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,480
...I'll greet you, saying,
'Namaste, Khadar sir'

183
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,200
I'll walk away bending double
pretending to be humble

184
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,680
Acting like you're scared of me
and as if you respect me

185
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,120
You should genuinely feel both

186
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,240
Why are you here?

187
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,320
Nothing, anna

188
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,560
I take care of little orphans
at Sarada Sadan

189
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,680
In the name of land conservation
your henchmen barged in

190
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,640
And they have locked our premises

191
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,200
If you return the keys to me...

192
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,240
...I will greet you
'Peace be unto you, bhai'

193
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,920
And quietly leave, bro

194
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,200
Return it, bro

195
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,640
He's on the verge of
opening his 2nd page

196
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,000
Give

197
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,280
What should I return?

198
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,040
What Khadar does is settlement
and what he says is statement

199
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,880
I head real estate
in these 2 states

200
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,640
Go on stage and act

201
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,920
Go...go

202
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,320
[Islamic prayer]

203
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,320
Yesterday I paid no heed to Jesus

204
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,240
That's a sign from Allah
At least you obey the omen, bro

205
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,000
What can he do if I don't listen?

206
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,880
Fire can burn everything to ash
Water can deluge and devastate

207
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,520
Wind as tornado can destroy
And also lightning from the sky

208
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,480
And Mother earth will bury you!

209
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,640
If the 5 basic elements
show their 'other' side...

210
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,880
...the Dance of Dissolution will occur

211
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,080
What you've done is just that

212
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,599
You nitwit

213
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Please come

214
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,920
My boss is a minister

215
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,320
To go behind bars
in his position is no joke

216
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,720
- Do you think he'll manage?
- How many times will you ask?

217
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,640
If Sivaji plays your boss's role,
he'll manage the Assembly too!

218
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,520
- Rest assured
- Let's go

219
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,680
Sivaji, lawyer has come

220
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,840
Good morning, sir

221
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Is it a bail case or no bail case?

222
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,600
If it isn't a bail case, I wouldn't
have come to you, Sivaji

223
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,760
What is the amount?

224
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,320
Whatever sir asks

225
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,560
Ask for 1 billion

226
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,040
Can't pay, right?

227
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,800
Tell an amount
you can afford

228
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
1 million

229
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,360
2.5 million

230
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
See you tomorrow

231
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,040
Sarada

232
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,680
On your next birthday...

233
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,240
...let's celebrate with our daughter

234
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,360
Who is this?
She's your screen saver?

235
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,920
My mother

236
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,760
Take him carefully

237
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,360
Nothing untoward should
happen to that patient

238
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,920
Otherwise those dependent on him
will become orphans like me

239
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,000
What is the case?

240
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,920
Why should you feel shy and
hesitate to answer this question?

241
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,680
This case is something to be ashamed of

242
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,160
There's no such party

243
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,840
For the development of my constituency...

244
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,440
...when I switched from my party
to this current party

245
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,880
...I hosted a party with full liquor

246
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,680
I overdrank and got my senses muddled

247
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,640
I ate a peacock
thinking it's a chicken!

248
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
That's all

249
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,320
Poor minister! He ate
only 1 piece of peacock meat

250
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,440
Nonstop Breaking News as if he hunted
for all peacocks in the forest

251
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,200
How did this news
leak to the media?

252
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,880
Our Minister himself leaked it out!

253
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,640
His obsession for taking selfies...

254
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,920
...made him click pictures of peacock fry

255
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,520
He posted it on Facebook!

256
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,200
You could've deleted that post

257
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,520
Before I could do it...

258
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,760
...some girl by name Sreshta,
a powerful journalist

259
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,520
...leaked the matter to the media

260
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,920
The job of media is to always
project politicians as comedians

261
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Hey, I want you to impersonate me
but you're walking off without confirming

262
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,680
Minister

263
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,600
You feasted on a peacock, right?

264
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,200
- What is your portfolio?
- Environment & Forests

265
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,320
Minister of Environment & Forests

266
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,480
Don't you know the peacock
is our national bird?

267
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,680
Even the National anthem he learnt
only after going to the theatres!

268
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,600
Minster of Environment & Forests
doesn't know what our national bird is

269
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,440
Sports minister doesn't know how
many medals we won in Olympics

270
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,600
Transport minister doesn't know
how many buses are plying

271
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,320
Hon'ble Minister

272
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,920
One claims he studied physics
in a commerce degree

273
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,480
The other politician
mixes up Arts and Science!

274
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,600
I provide pension for the people
They walk on roads laid by me

275
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,480
But why won't they vote for me?

276
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,040
Few people ask this

277
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Some politicians don't even know
to take their pledge properly

278
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,360
They make an ass of themselves
barking like a dog

279
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,920
All of you are ministers

280
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,720
We made you win
by casting our votes

281
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,400
Sekar, never bring
such cases to me in future

282
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,360
Hey! Do you know
who you're talking to?

283
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,560
Even the opposition party
won't talk to me like this

284
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
So don't think you're a bigshot

285
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,800
He's a first page actor

286
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,480
So he will act in different roles

287
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,800
2nd page is original

288
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,480
He'll show his true colors

289
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,320
It's better you beg
the 1st page actor

290
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,600
Let's not turn the 2nd page

291
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,200
What's this 1st page
and 2nd page?

292
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,800
Step aside
Listen

293
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,000
Hey! Party, stop

294
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,800
If you're this sincere
what can we do?

295
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,400
You seem like an honest
politician, stop...stop

296
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,520
Why do you get so worked up?

297
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,400
I won't touch a peacock again in my life

298
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,400
Won't even touch any creature with wings

299
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Please save me
just this once

300
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,520
- Hey, Sivaji
- Lawyer

301
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,760
He's walking off

302
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,600
What, my party?

303
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,080
Wow! Exactly my voice

304
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,240
What about my form?

305
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,880
Yes, I ate

306
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,040
He ate a peacock, a deer, public money

307
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,720
And gobbled Govt funds also

308
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,360
Opposition party is slandering me
with these accusations, sir

309
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,240
But what I actually ate was...

310
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,680
...a betting chicken which was
sent by my friend in Bhimavaram

311
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,560
The accused Javadhu Sankar Rao

312
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,840
...has been remanded to custody for 14 days

313
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,920
I went on the stand
Will he get into the van?

314
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Where is he?

315
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,720
Exchange will happen
near the Telephone Exchange

316
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,320
Sooooper, my party!

317
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,680
If my wife or mistress sees you
they'll think it's me for sure!

318
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,920
Hello, Mr Sankar Rao

319
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,360
Look into the formalities

320
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,800
Minister, you've got
an excellent candidate

321
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,560
Even I couldn't recognise him
though I know you so well

322
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,760
Yes, party

323
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,680
Attend the booze party I'm hosting
at my guest house tonight

324
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,680
Jyothi, minister is in our jail

325
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,000
- Sir, special room for minister
- Sorry, minister

326
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,680
Due to inevitable reasons,
we couldn't allot a special room

327
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,800
I've allotted a special room

328
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,880
Sir, I personally took care
of assigning the room

329
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,720
Hey, crackpot, shut up!

330
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
Jyothi, looks like the minister is upset!

331
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Hello Sankar Rao sir

332
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,840
You had peacock meat

333
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,560
I had God's offering

334
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,880
I am also imprisoned

335
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,760
Praise be to Lord Govinda!

336
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,320
- I've seen him somewhere
- Temple trust's employee

337
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
Along with offerings
he looted the donation box too!

338
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,400
Doesn't he look like a man
who will loot temple and its assets?

339
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,600
Our party!

340
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,200
Even though our state doesn't get priority
ministers are an exception!

341
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,640
I think the tank is empty

342
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,760
Not enough if you fuel
the channel's Think tank

343
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,760
You must fill your fuel tank also

344
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,680
'Madam, he looks like
minister Sankar Rao'

345
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,680
'How come he's out
when he should be in jail!'

346
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,920
'Visakhapatnam Jail'

347
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,400
- Tell me
- Minister Sankar Rao

348
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,600
Can't take interviews

349
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,600
Not that, in the car-

350
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,920
Not possible in the car
You can use me instead

351
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,840
I mean you can interview me

352
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,040
I saw Minister Sankar Rao in a car
in Gajuwaka with some women

353
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,000
Jyothi, did you hear that?

354
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,280
I believe she saw the minister
in a car in Gajuwaka

355
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,720
Nice joke, right?

356
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,520
The minister is not in his cell

357
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,360
Jyothi, she's joking again

358
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,800
I want to meet the minister now

359
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
Do you have court permission?

360
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,600
Before I get permission,
you can replace him, huh?

361
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,680
You've hurt my ego

362
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,760
You've insulted this sub-jailer Shyamala

363
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,920
Come, I'll show you

364
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,520
Ravi, open the minister's cell in D block

365
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,680
Shyamala will take no chance

366
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,480
Missed her, I say!

367
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,480
Move

368
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,760
In these 14 days I looked through
all the old accounts in my farm house

369
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,640
I'm talking to you, move aside

370
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,240
Hey, stop

371
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,360
Clicking a photo of my husband

372
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,560
Give my camera back

373
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,040
Return it

374
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,360
Stop...!

375
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,040
What's going on between
my husband and you?

376
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,840
Hey! Stop

377
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,440
If she tempts you
by wearing a tight dress...

378
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,360
...what happened to your stupid brain?

379
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,040
All she wanted was
1 photo of mine, so I agreed

380
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,640
I'm handsome, right?

381
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,000
What's my name?

382
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,920
Shah Rukh Khan

383
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,840
Do you find her more beautiful than me?

384
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Let's go

385
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,800
This is the balance
after taking my commission

386
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,920
Sivaji, look at the girl in that scooter

387
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,880
Who...?

388
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,640
She's the journalist who registered
a case against our minister

389
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Very shrewd

390
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,360
Once she focuses on an assignment...

391
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
...she won't give up

392
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,920
She won't let go of me

393
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,640
Neither will I get caught!

394
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,520
Switch on the left indicator

395
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,720
Turn right

396
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,720
'Is he the one who went to jail
instead of the minister?'

397
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,600
'Sarada Sadan'

398
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,640
We seem to be flooded with letters

399
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,720
Yes

400
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,880
Any news about my daughter?

401
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,080
We've left no stone unturned
these past 25 years, Sivaji

402
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,080
We've also inquired in
all the Trusts in North India

403
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,800
We got back a report
as 'Not identified'

404
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,720
Okay

405
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Send this money

406
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,400
To all the Trusts

407
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,880
With the money you donate
to these Trusts...

408
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,320
...you're hoping at least
1 rupee will reach your daughter

409
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,800
Whether your daughter
gets this money or not...

410
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,840
...you're doing such a noble service
to many orphans, Sivaji

411
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,680
Your service will reap rewards one day

412
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,199
Uncle, for the past 2 weeks
where did you go?

413
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,440
I visited the birth place
of Lord Krishna, dear

414
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,240
I was wondering if you'll make it
for Lord Hanuman's birthday

415
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,800
- We've prepared everything
- Where?

416
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,560
Come, I'll show you

417
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,040
"In Hanuman, I trust duly
Swift as the mind; fast as the wind truly"

418
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,480
"Who is master of the senses
Honored for his intelligence"

419
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,600
"Son of wind god Vayu
Chief of the Vanaras too"

420
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,079
"To that messenger of Lord Rama devotedly
I prostrate before, wholeheartedly"

421
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,839
"Praise be to the Monkey God Hanuman"

422
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,120
"Praise be to Anjaneya
Messenger of Rama"

423
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,240
"Vayu's son
Hanuman"

424
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,400
"For our world's glory, you're the reason
Lord Rama's steadfast devotee Hanuman"

425
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:37,000
"Like Lord Rama blessing us always
He showers his grace in all ways"

426
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,400
"The red sun he went in pursuit
mistaking it for an ivy gourd fruit"

427
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,760
"Hanuman, I prostrate before you
Accept my offerings true"

428
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,320
"Listen and favor
our heart's wishes forever"

429
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,560
"Hanuman has a grip strong as thunder
to ensure evil demons fall and surrender"

430
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,680
"Praise be to Anjaneya
son of Anjana"

431
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,680
"Praise be to the radiant one
Golden in form like the sun"

432
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,360
"Glory to the Ambassador of Rama
who gave the ring to His consort Sita"

433
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,480
"Only once look at me
to shower your mercy"

434
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,560
"Praise be to Hanuman, the skillful scholar"

435
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,520
"Glory to hanuman, known for his valor"

436
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,360
"Praise be to Hanuman
The slayer of many a demon"

437
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,600
"Shower your compassion
on those drowning in depression"

438
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,400
"Vayu's son
Hanuman"

439
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,400
"Bow to Hanuman
The courageous one"

440
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:42,320
"For earth's splendor, you're the reason
Lord Rama's most loyal devotee Hanuman"

441
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,560
"O' mind, recite 'Hanuman' and reminisce"

442
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,920
"Proclaim at very high decibels
Chanting his name brings bliss"

443
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,000
"O' mind, chant Hanuman's name gladly"

444
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,760
"Proclaim loudly and boldly
Chanting his name brings joy duly"

445
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,320
"Call out aloud in unison
Glory to Hanuman, granter of wisdom"

446
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,040
"Offer prayers to Lord Rama every minute"

447
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,360
"Surrender your heart to Rama absolute"

448
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,720
"Whatever the 'yuga' may be
your lips should chant only Rama's glory"

449
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,920
"Your boons will always nurture & nourish"

450
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,240
"Your bravery will flourish
It will never diminish"

451
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,600

ready to even fight God with utmost spirit"

452
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,920
"Rama is the protector
of our universe forever"

453
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,680
"Every village and town
is guarded by our Hanuman"

454
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,320
"Hanuman has a grip strong as thunder
to ensure evil demons are killed forever"

455
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,640
"One who has the buzzing of bees continuous
as beat of drums in his heart mellifluous"

456
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,600
"Hanuman, master of all vedas essential
Worthy of worship quintessential"

457
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,880
"You accepted my soul as humble offering"

458
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,440
"Lord Rama dwells in your heart as a flower
Shines to light up devotees' lives forever"

459
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,640
"O' mind, recite 'Hanuman' and reminisce"

460
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,360

"Minimizing the mighty sea
you jumped into it bravely"

464
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,920
"If any hurdle blocks the way
don't retreat in dismay"

465
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,880
"You found where Sita was in captivity
Wiped the tears of Rama with sensitivity"

466
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,120
"You are the link, o' divinity
to bonds of love and dignity"

467
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:17,360
"By securing Lord Rama in your heart
you showed the world God won't depart"

468
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,400

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,880
"Call out aloud in unison
Glory to Hanuman, granter of wisdom"

478
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,920
Temperature will come down, dear

479
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,000
Someone is here looking for you

480
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,200
- Who are you?
- I want to interview you

481
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,880
Interview me? Why?

482
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,080
You support all these orphan kids
and run this institution very well

483
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,600
Want to tell this world
about your magnanimity

484
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,320
I'm one of the orphans here

485
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,240
I'm an ordinary actor

486
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
How can you call yourself ordinary?

487
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,640
Social, rural, mythological, historical

488
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,200
How many different roles on stage

489
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,440
In addition, recently...

490
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,320
...for 14 days you performed
nonstop as a politician!

491
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,440
Think you've come to
the wrong address

492
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,680
I came here to say
what you did was wrong

493
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,040
Come out in the open, sir

494
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,640
Jailer, minister, all of them
Can close their chapters

495
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
If that's the case
write down this number

496
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,800
Whose number is this?

497
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,600
He will confirm you as mental

498
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,240
- Get yourself checked
- Yes, I'm mental

499
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,440
In my profession I'm commit(mental)

500
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,680
I'll not give up until you're caught

501
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,240
With sand mafias, land grabbing,
corruption in Govt projects sanctioned

502
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,680
...how many politicians and ministers

503
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,920
...create havoc in the lives of the poor
dealing in unjust ways

504
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,680
Write about them and
bring their lives out in the open

505
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,600
Lord Nataraja will protect you

506
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,880
Me and my simple life

507
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,920
Why do you want to know, tell me?

508
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,600
Sivaji, I got a super deal
Good lifestyle for a lifetime

509
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,880
Yours or mine?

510
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,040
For both of us

511
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,400
But this is a big-shot party

512
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,880
I've sent you the location in WhatsApp
Please come to Narayanadri hospital

513
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,600
Who is he?
What is the dea-

514
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,880
I'll tell you when I see you

515
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Hey! Listen-

516
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,040
What is the matter with this girl?

517
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,480
Like a spider in a web
she keeps spiralling around me

518
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,400
Who are you?

519
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,320
- Stop...stop
- Quick...run

520
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,840
In the end you made me a prime star!

521
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,720
I don't know how Sindhu would have felt
bagging the gold in the Olympics

522
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,440
After that ramp walk
I am on cloud 9

523
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,480
Anjali

524
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,000
'How do I escape from her?'

525
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,400
I'm going in to see
the doctor, you be here

526
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,920
Gayatri

527
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,720
Were you in your right mind
when you did this?

528
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,000
If something drastic had happened
who is responsible?

529
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,480
What is the need to take a patient out
when she is on the verge of dying?

530
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,640
I know we can't save her in any case

531
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,800
I wanted to make her last wish a reality

532
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,040
We are not God to
make her dreams come true

533
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,920
I am the reason you got pulled up, right?

534
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,520
Aren't you happy?

535
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,000
I'll divorce her

536
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,480
I'll marry you and
show you the full moon!

537
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,520
Let's go

538
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,440
Why so late, Sivaji?

539
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,200
I waited in the hospital for you
for so long and left just now

540
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,600
Sekar, the journalist you mentioned
is hounding me like the 'Hutch' puppy!

541
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,400
Let's meet tomorrow, bye

542
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,080
Please escort me to the car

543
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,800
Get inside now!

544
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,400
Let go!

545
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,840
"I meditate on Gayatri, dear to Vishnu
Who has 3 eyes and 5 heads true"

546
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,560
"Glory to Gayatri"

547
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,600
[Gayatri Ashtangam]

548
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,240
"I surrender to Gayatri
Abode of virtues for eternity"

549
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,480
"Who has clear insight on everything
Lover of Sama Veda chanting"

550
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:24,520
"I meditate on Gayatri sublime
holds the discus, governs Wheel of time"

551
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,560
"I pray to Gayatri; who is formidable
Fierce, furious and wrathful"

552
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,160
"Praise be to Gayatri"

553
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,440
"Glory to Gayatri"

Guardian to every devotee"

"I worship Gayatri; chant Her hymn
Fountainhead of wisdom"

556
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:57,560
"I surrender to Gayatri
who illumines the world radiantly"

557
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,240
"Praise be to Gayatri"

558
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,040
"Glory to Gayatri"

559
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,800
- Who are they, dear?
- I don't know, uncle

560
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,680
Enemies emerge as soon as
a girl child is born, my dear

561
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,880
The girl baby is killed
as soon as the gender is known

562
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,640
She's killed if she doesn't fall in love

563
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,600
Thank you for rescuing me, uncle

564
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,000
No problem, dear

565
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,880
Go home safe and sound

566
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,880
I got into a brawl when I had to
rescue a girl from being kidnapped

567
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,640
She left her phone behind

568
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,520
She left before I could give it to her

569
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,000
No charge in the phone now

570
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,000
Can I make a call from your phone?

571
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,560
Sarada!

572
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,680
Prasaaad!

573
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,560
Sarada's photo is in this phone

574
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,520
This phone belongs to my daughter

575
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,680
'Come here'

576
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,400
Uncle, you found my phone?

577
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,520
If my phone is with you
it's as good as being with me

578
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,080
If you hadn't come there as a godsend
I dread to think of my plight

579
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,440
I forgot to tell you
I am graduating as a doctor

580
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,120
Tomorrow is my convocation
at Sree Vidyanikethan

581
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,840
You must come without fail

582
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,840
I can collect the phone from you then

583
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,640
Definitely

584
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,160
I'll come without fail, dear

585
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,560
Prasad, look at this photo

586
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,040
My daughter called me

587
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,200
She's a doctor it seems

588
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,120
Sivaji, till now I thought
God does not exist

589
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,840
Now I take it back
I believe in that Supreme power

590
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,480
- Sekar is calling
- No need

591
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,120
Tell him I won't get
my hands dirty hereafter

592
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,480
'He wanted me to tell you
he said 'no deal'

593
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,880
'Tell him the offer is 10 million'

594
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,280
10 million, huh?

595
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,800
I told you I won't

596
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,840
You heard him?

597
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,200
He said he won't

598
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,840
Don't call us hereafter

599
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,920
The daughter I was yearning
to see all these years

600
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,800
She is walking into my life
of her own accord

601
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,800
I don't need to lead a life
shrouded in sin

602
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,160
Tomorrow I am meeting my daughter

603
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,920
"Go, vanish, disappear
No more tears hereafter"

604
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,720
"Come, arise, appear
Happiness now and forever"

605
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,440
"Let it materialize, happen anew
Let my dream come true"

606
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,840
"Let the scars of my heart
fade once and for all to depart"

607
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,600
"Let every moment swell
be a festival to revel"

608
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,120
"Let every new moon night wane
for full moon to shine bright again"

609
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,800
"O'sun snoring away to glory
covered by a blanket of clouds dreary"

610
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,840
"Wake up now to adorn my sky of joy
with a new dawn to rejoice"

611
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,440
"Come, orange dawn
Welcome, early morn"

612
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,120
"Go away, purple night sky
My world without light, good bye"

613
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,880
"Go, vanish, disappear
No more tears hereafter"

614
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,640
"Come, arise, appear
Happiness now and forever"

615
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,200
"Let it materialize, happen anew
Let my dream come true"

616
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,240
"Let the scars of my heart
fade once and for all to depart"

617
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,400
"As soon as she sees me
will she come running happily"

618
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,000
"Beating her fists in sheer relief
will she shed happy tears, no more grief?"

619
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,600
"Hereafter if you abandon me, night or day"

620
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,400
"I swear I won't talk to you, will she say?"

621
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,920
"My heart will be on a flying spree
Like a kite rushing behind her carefree"

622
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,840
"When will my precious drop of dew
call me 'father' with a love so true?"

623
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,760
"O' sun, no more slumber
wake up to unite me with my daughter"

624
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,640
"Come, orange dawn
Welcome, early morn"

625
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,720
"Go away, purple night sky
My world without light, good bye"

626
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,160
"A day will dawn I knew
when face to face I'll meet you"

627
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,000
"My only last wish sincere
I held on to, my dear"

628
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:50,640
"For a father not to know
his baby is his mother reborn though"

629
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,120
"Life is a curse for such a father on earth
who is in the dark of his daughter's birth"

630
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,160
"This is the full story
of a father weary"

631
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,920
"I want my head on your lap to rest
And tell you all this in right earnest"

632
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,200
"O' sun, please don't doze
My life has opened to new doors"

633
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,880
'For pelvic cancer research in America'

634
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,160
'Dr Gayatri has been selected
from our college'

635
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,000
'We are extremely happy'

636
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,800
'Accompanied by a sense of pride'

637
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,240
'Namaste' to everyone gathered here

638
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,120
The reason I am standing here
as a doctor today before all of you

639
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,600
...my father

640
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,440
Yes, my father

641
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,600
A father is every child's hero

642
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,000
But in my life alone...

643
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,160
...villain!

644
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,000
My mother passed away
as soon as I was born

645
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,720
I don't even know how my father looks

646
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,200
But I only know my father
is a heartless brute

647
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,400
My father who did not know
the meaning of 'nana'

648
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:34,440
...sold me for just Rs 1000
to buy himself a bottle of liquor

649
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,080
A father is said to be one who bears
all burdens, shoulders responsibility

650
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,800
What do you call a man who considers
his own daughter as a burden?

651
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,920
I became an orphan because of my father
This sense of anguish is always within me

652
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,840
If ever I meet him in this birth...

653
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,640
...I will not even look at his face

654
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,120
If I had someone to share my pain...

655
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,520
I would have done so
within the 4 walls of my home

656
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,840
Only because I don't have anyone...

657
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,080
...I let my feelings flow out here

658
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,800
Everyone breathes the air
invisible to human eyes

659
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,760
God gives us life and sustenance

660
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,760
Similarly so many people I've never seen
made me what I am today

661
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,640
I am indebted to each
and every one of them

662
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,040
'He sold me for just Rs 1000
to buy himself a bottle of liquor'

663
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,480
'But I only know my father
is a heartless brute'

664
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,560
Gayatri?

665
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,520
Here's your phone

666
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,000
Who are you?

667
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,200
Where is that uncle?

668
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,640
He can't come

669
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,160
He can't face you
in this lifetime

670
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,240
Why?

671
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,920
He is your father!

672
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,920
Your biological father whom you hate!

673
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,080
I can't believe it

674
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,280
If it's true
I don't want him

675
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,760
My dear child, 1 minute

676
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,360
How dangerous it is to get treated
not knowing what the ailment is...

677
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,160
'...same holds good for accusing a man
without knowing the whole truth, dear'

678
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,640
This is your father's diary

679
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,280
Get to know about him
and his life through this, dear

680
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,040
'After being introduced to this society
I learnt I was an orphan'

681
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,720
'After getting acquainted
with a drama company...'

682
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,560
'...I realized I am a born actor'

683
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,880
'On festive days and
during temple festivals'

684
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:08,720
'...our drama troupe will be invited to
perform in some village or the other'

685
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,280
'You are the purest language
without alphabets as anchorage'

686
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,080
'I set eyes on Sarada on that day'

687
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,600
Hey! Flagstaff!
Move aside

688
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,480
You shower flowers on him
as if he's the newly married groom

689
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,040
And you act as if you have
come here to receive him in style

690
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,800
What am I standing here for?

691
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,920
This garland is for me
I'll also enter with a garland

692
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,880
What are the arrangements
for our stay here?

693
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,000
My daughter Sarada

694
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,280
Make sure their stay
is comfortable, dear

695
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,360
Please come in

696
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,120
Are you trying to hook
the president's daughter?

697
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,600
He won't fix a wedding date

698
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,920
He will send you to heaven!

699
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,320
'Go inside'

700
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,760
Oye! Won't the bus start?

701
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,000
What a dumb question!

702
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,000
Bus started long ago and
in fact even reached its destination

703
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,720
That girl is falling into Sivaji's love-net

704
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,920
I won't let that happen!

705
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,840
'Hey! Take your hand away
from her bangles'

706
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,640
You can serve also, right?

707
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,720
What are you studying now?

708
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,040
Yaddanapudi Sulochana Rani's novel

709
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,000
Not what novel you're reading
at leisure, dear

710
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,720
I meant in college

711
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,680
Hey! 7th grade

712
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,840
Undergraduate here

713
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,800
You're happily flirting with her

714
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,240
You frittered away your wealth
and submerged in debts now

715
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,640
Wasting money on drama
on every festive day

716
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,400
Remember you have a daughter
That too, ready to be married

717
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,760
'Hey! Banta soda'

718
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,920
You have 2 daughters
to find grooms for

719
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,080
Attend to them first

720
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,880
Like father like daughter!

721
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,680
Why were you so brutally frank, dear?

722
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,000
Any thought peeps into my mind
I express it frankly

723
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,920
Whatever action
will follow as reaction

724
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,120
"Praise be to Shiva, destroyer of evil"

725
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,840
"Glory to Lord Shiva, most primeval"

726
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:58,000
"I adore the one who sips the nectar
from kadamba tree's burflower"

727
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:03,880
"Which is the abode forever
of auspicious qualities to favor"

728
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,920
"The destroyer of Kamadeva and Pura"

729
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,760
"Of mundane existence
and Daksha's sacrifice"

730
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:15,600
"He who killed Gaja, Andhaka
And destroyed the lord of death, Yama"

731
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,200
[Shiva Tandava]

732
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,160
I asked you to rehearse
Duryodana's role

733
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,040
You're busy practising
Ravana's role in Ramayana?

734
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,560
Sivaji is famous for his role
as Ravana, so let him continue

735
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,920
What do you mean 'famous'?

736
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,640
Day before yesterday didn't his fans
pour milk in Palakollu?

737
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,640
There was excess of milk
from their buffaloes

738
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,240
You thought it was
an offering by his fans?

739
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,760
I pitied him
for being an orphan

740
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,600
I wanted him to
enact Duryodana's role

741
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,760
He ruined that too

742
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,880
A man who has no caste or religion
cannot don a character's role

743
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,880
Come along

744
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,520
Stop, my guru

745
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,600
What did you say just now?

746
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,200
You think I am not eligible
based on my caste or lack of it?

747
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,000
What words of ignorance!

748
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,600
This is an evaluation for bravery
Not a verification of your genealogy

749
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,240
It is not right and
should not exist

750
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,240
Are you saying this is a test
of one's lineage?

751
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,400
What is the lineage of
your father Gudimetla Gangaraju?

752
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,920
What about the offensive incident
regarding your birth?

753
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,120
You were born in a trash can

754
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,920
What is your lineage?

755
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,880
You flicked purses in temple festivals

756
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,920
You got caught and
you were beaten to a pulp

757
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You were noticed
by this drama troupe

758
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,920
You fell at the owner's feet
and he gave you shelter

759
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,400
When no one was around

760
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,640
...you seduced his sister with a purpose
while she screamed in protest

761
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:42,920
With no other option left
he got you married to his sister

762
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,560
You then took over 'Kala Parishad'
and hounded us like a mad dog

763
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,000
What caste do you belong to?

764
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,120
And on top of all this

765
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:59,000
...you made a pass at the maid
and got a rude slap as her gift

766
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:06,520
Your lineage with your hidden agenda
is now a cross breed and hence corrupt

767
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,000
That was so well said

768
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,840
Only you should don
whatever role is required

769
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,680
Whatever action
will follow as reaction

770
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,040
Cast your vote
to the crow symbol

771
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,080
Greetings, president

772
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,520
Good day, MLA sir

773
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,640
In this town, you and I
belong to the same caste

774
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,760
I have no doubt whatsoever
People of our caste will vote only for us

775
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:41,600
But people from other castes
won't pay heed to my words

776
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,880
They will listen to you

777
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,040
Jogendar sir, I don't wish
to get involved in all this

778
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,160
Don't put me in a tight spot
Don't you know me?

779
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,200
Don't refuse

780
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,000
You should do this for me
No other go

781
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,320
Even if he has no other go
my father won't comply

782
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,000
You can leave now

783
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,920
What are you saying?

784
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,240
According to me as a voter
palms should be greased

785
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:01,919
And a woman should be
kept under a leash

786
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,040
Did you buy this girl
or you gave birth to her?

787
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,480
Hey! Moron who does not realize
the value of a sister and mother

788
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,720
Is this how you address a lady?

789
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,760
True, to become a politician,
you stooped so low to kill your wife

790
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,920
You lowlife!

791
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,040
As if you can value a woman?
Caste-ism votes it seems

792
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,240
How dare you malign our brother!

793
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,000
Sivaji, don't be impulsive

794
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,000
Sivaji, stop

795
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,080
'Will you hit all and sundry?'

796
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,280
You bash up the guilty

797
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,120
You also hit the innocent

798
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,080
Why this mad fury?
Is it necessary?

799
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,080
Your nature is to speak aloud
whatever you think

800
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,000
My character is to
let my fists speak

801
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,920
That's why I ask you
not to lose your cool

802
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,600
A talented artiste
dwells within you

803
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,320
Rejuvenate him, don't encourage
the one who picks a quarrel

804
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,840
Brandishing a knife or stick
anyone can be a rowdy

805
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,200
But not everyone
can become an artiste

806
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,000
I wish to see you as a hero

807
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,160
My nature is to speak aloud
whatever thoughts peep into my mind

808
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,840
Whatever action
will follow as reaction

809
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,840
I was so depressed
I had no one in this world

810
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,280
But after I set eyes on you...

811
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,800
...I feel I have a family of my own

812
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,360
A mother, reprimands to reform me

813
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,680
A father, reiterates my responsibilities

814
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,040
'A wife who shares my love and life
All 3 roles rolled as you'

815
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,680
Into my world...

816
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,280
...will you come as my wife?

817
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,000
I'll cherish you as my own life

818
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,920
You said whatever thoughts peep
into my mind I should speak out

819
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,120
Actions thereafter
will follow as reaction

820
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:44,880
"I see myself in your eyes duly"

821
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,880
"I am present gaily
in the sheen of your lips daily"

822
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,920
"I will hide myself discreetly
in your breath secretly"

823
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,920
"In your embrace I forget myself totally"

824
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,920
"I do not live for my own self, I tell you"

825
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,840
"If I am your equal half, that will do"

826
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,920
"My heart belongs to you true"

827
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,120
"My (life)time is yours too"

828
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,920
"I live thinking 'me' is only you"

829
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,920
"You and me
Now united as we"

830
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
"Hereafter one life one soul
Husband and wife as a whole"

831
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,000
"You and me
Now merged as we"

832
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,920
"Hereafter no separate identity
But unified as a single entity"

833
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,040
"You and me
Now fused as we"

834
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:37,560
"Hereafter no difference in name
We are one and the same"

835
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,640
"I led a mundane life, unaware till date"

836
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,720
"I found myself after so long, my soulmate"

837
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,760
"For the art nestled & nurtured within me
you showed kaleidoscopic dreams soulfully"

838
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,600
"I turned with tears overflowing
to your love so endearing"

839
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:41,680
"Shall I erase your past without a trace?
Start a new life, hand in hand always?"

840
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,920
"You sang to me
our love's lullaby"

841
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,240
"In your tender loving care, I'm a baby"

842
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,000
"I erased my identity willingly"

843
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,240
"I take your name as mine befittingly"

844
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,600
"My heart belongs to you true"

845
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,600
"My (life)time is yours too"

846
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,120
"I live thinking 'me' is only you"

847
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,160
"You and me
Now united as we"

848
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:14,280
"Hereafter one heart one soul
Husband and wife as a whole"

849
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:18,320
"You and me
Now forged as we"

850
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,160
"Hereafter no difference between us
We bond as one love-nexus"

851
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,880
"The word 'have not' exists no longer"

852
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,160
"In your smile forever
I find a joy that will linger"

853
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:08,160
"No other boon do I want in life"

854
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,680
"Knowing an angel is now my wife"

855
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,080
"Life turned into a treasure trove golden"

856
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:20,240
"A path laden with flowers opened unbidden"

857
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,560
"Your halo as rainbow hues on display"

858
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:28,360
"Don't let go of my hand, come what may"

859
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:33,000
"Warm fuzzies melt me
in your love drizzle lovely"

860
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,040
"I blossom as a new flower
For our love to last forever"

861
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,080
"My (life)time is yours too"

862
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,080
"My heart belongs to you true"

863
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,800
"I live thinking 'me' is only you"

864
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,840
"You and me
Now bonded as we"

865
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,680
"Hereafter one life, one soul
Husband and wife as a whole"

866
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,840
"You and me
Now known as we"

867
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,400
"Hereafter we will be
an inseparable entity"

868
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,920
She is suffering from pelvic cancer

869
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,560
'3rd stage'

870
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,080
'She has to be treated immediately'

871
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,920
'Arrange for 0.1 million cash'

872
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,520
Alright, doctor

873
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,800
Rs 100000?!

874
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:45,160
After a performance on stage
the hands that applaud are more than...

875
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:50,000
...helping hands and willing hearts
who will reach out

876
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,920
I am not in a position
to help you in that manner

877
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,280
Sivaji, someone is willing to pay you
Rs 100000 if you act in real life

878
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,560
Will you do it?

879
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,600
A well-to-do man was refused bail

880
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,000
If you go to jail just for
2 days instead of him

881
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,880
...he will advance
the amount for you

882
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,040
Alright

883
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,800
I don't know if you can hear me now

884
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,880
Whether I am donning
a role I should not

885
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,920
Or committing a grave mistake
I shouldn't, I am clueless

886
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,600
Our baby in your womb

887
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,320
Me standing before you

888
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,320
Both our lives are intertwined with yours

889
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,920
It is said a wife is
a husband's equal half

890
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,520
But...

891
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:45,920
...you are everything to me

892
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,560
Don't abandon me

893
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,600
I can't live without you

894
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,920
I will go now

895
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,920
And I will return soon

896
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,760
Hey! Take good care of her

897
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,120
Sivaji, be brave and go
I'll take care

898
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,520
'I went in someone else's shoes
and I was deceived'

899
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,600
'2 days stretched into 2 weeks
after which I was released'

900
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,160
Hey! Giri

901
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,320
Sivaji

902
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,840
They kept me behind bars
for 2 weeks instead of 2 days

903
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,880
I went home
Sarada wasn't there

904
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,560
Sarada passed away

905
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,920
Your daughter also died

906
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,080
Not knowing how to let you know
I'm lying here in a drunken stupor

907
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,240
Forgive me

908
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,840
Sivaji, move

909
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,320
Giri, why did you do this?

910
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,640
I deserve this
to atone my sins

911
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,840
Your wife is no more

912
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,880
But your child is alive

913
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,320
What are you saying?!

914
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,160
I thought of selling the baby
for a bottle of liquor

915
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,800
This baby is a golden godsend
Buy her for 1000 rupees

916
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,160
Get lost!

917
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,040
'Ramanujam Orphanage'

918
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,920
- Hey ! Stop
- Are you selling this baby?

919
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,800
Prasad, snatch the baby from him

920
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:46,480
Someone from the orphanage
hit me and took your baby from me

921
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,920
Which orphanage, Giri?

922
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,600
Which orphanage?

923
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,800
Which orphanage?

924
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,120
'Ramanujam Orphanage
Tenali'

925
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,520
'Today is the day
we found you'

926
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,480
That is, your birthday

927
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,120
This is a birthday gift for you

928
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,920
Your mother

929
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,360
Your mother died
as soon as she delivered you

930
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,880
I made some enquiries around

931
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,200
What about my father?

932
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,720
Your father was a rogue
A drunkard!

933
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,280
When he tried to sell you for Rs 1000
we rescued you from him

934
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,480
Uncle, I have to see my father

935
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,600
Right now

936
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,600
Come, dear

937
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,680
'Sarada Sadan'

938
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,520
Father

939
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,920
'Nana'

940
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,920
Father?

941
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,600
My mother

942
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,400
I'm back, ma

943
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,280
Back to my father
where I belong

944
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,760
Don't be anxious

945
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,560
I know very well where Sivaji will be

946
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,200
- I'll go get him
- No, I'll also come along, uncle

947
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,320
Come, dear

948
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,640
'Whenever your father
is upset about something...'

949
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,240
'...this is the place he comes to'

950
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,000
'He'll certainly be here'

951
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,480
[phone ringing]

952
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,720
Where is it?

953
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,480
His phone is switched off

954
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,440
Sivaji loves the children he nurtures

955
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,480
Wherever he goes, he'll be back
at the Home, come, dear

956
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,720
When father and daughter were about
to meet, who kidnapped Sivaji?

957
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,480
Gayatri Patel!

958
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,400
Gayatri Patel?

959
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,240
Even bad people will pray to God

960
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,920
Till date I don't understand that logic

961
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,400
God is very kind

962
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,320
He will grant boons readily
even to demons!

963
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,120
You have deep clarity of thought

964
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,760
But people with no clarity...

965
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,520
...are waiting outside for you

966
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,320
We are here to arrest you

967
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,600
Not enough if you have
a warrant, Circle Inspector Raja

968
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,320
You need clarity, got it?

969
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,040
We found a dead body in Jagadamba centre

970
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,000
'We have some witnesses over there'

971
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,640
We need to interrogate you

972
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:28,400
Family and assets are bondages
of a previous birth

973
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,120
To have been killed by me now, he must
have been blessed in his previous birth

974
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,760
Do you know why I killed him?

975
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,440
To nurture and nourish your family

976
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,720
How can that be?

977
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,080
Circle Inspector

978
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,080
Think logically

979
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,000
I killed a person

980
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,640
Clue team came to the crime spot

981
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,560
One policeman sprinkled powder

982
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,000
Another policeman marked the dead body
with a red piece of chalk, all around it

983
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,920
Ambulance driver

984
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,480
The photographer

985
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,440
Doctor who did post mortem

986
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,680
Nurse who assisted the doctor

987
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,120
To create a smoke-screen
and conceal or reveal

988
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,440
Must inform public, right?

989
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,680
Channels...some lousy channels

990
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,200
Newspapers

991
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,360
I've created job opportunities
for all these people

992
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,080
You say you want
to arrest me?

993
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,200
My dear man

994
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,880
You are this nation's eldest son

995
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,200
Creating job opportunities
for the entire nation

996
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,280
I love you, prince!

997
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,240
Hey CI, your wife has called
from a jewellery store

998
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:34,440
I believe she sent you pictures on
WhatsApp, take a look and select

999
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,520
'Did you check your WhatsApp?'

1000
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,880
Why did you call him?

1001
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,000
- 'Listen to me'
- Hang up

1002
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,600
CI sir

1003
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,280
Are you wondering
why your wife called us?

1004
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,480
This isn't a business relationship

1005
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,360
Only human kinship

1006
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,360
This Patel's human relationship

1007
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,200
If you wear a khaki uniform,
you can work as a police officer

1008
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:01,840
Or you can even be
a bathroom cleaner

1009
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,440
Baton...?

1010
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,000
Or broomstick?

1011
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,440
I'll take leave, sir

1012
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,000
Circle Inspector

1013
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,520
A guest who has entered my home
shouldn't leave empty handed

1014
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,680
I must send him off with a gift

1015
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,200
That's my custom

1016
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,080
Please accept

1017
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,520
Oh my God!

1018
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,000
His character is worse
than a polluted politician!

1019
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,360
Why did he kidnap Sivaji then?

1020
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,600
Who are you?

1021
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,720
We are beasts wandering and mingling
with the people of this society

1022
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,360
- Why did you bring me here?
- Nothing, Raja

1023
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,720
Like how ministers
frequently travel abroad...

1024
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,440
...you go to jail that often, right?

1025
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,640
For that reason

1026
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,520
I informed Sekar
I've put an end to it

1027
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,000
No one will believe you, my dear

1028
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,840
If a politician claims he was
elected being the people's favorite...

1029
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,200
...and not for money
no one will believe this

1030
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,920
Listen to me

1031
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,760
Gayatri Patel is a well respected man

1032
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,080
He likes you a lot

1033
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,840
Listen to him, you'll do well in life too

1034
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,520
Why are you begging him?

1035
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,280
If you break few of his bones and
crush them, he'll himself agree

1036
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,480
Go ahead

1037
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,280
Uncle, what are you doing?

1038
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,080
Checking the phone lines

1039
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,120
Family and assets are bondages
of a previous birth

1040
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:01,240
Don't know for which birth
you owe this debt of gratitude

1041
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,880
But you look like me
and I look like you too

1042
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,360
We resemble each other

1043
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,520
Stage actor Sivaji

1044
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,520
Just 14 days

1045
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,320
You go there
and I stay here

1046
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,440
Otherwise-

1047
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,800
Don't mess with my children
and force me to open the 2nd page

1048
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,000
Every page in Gayatri Patel's record....

1049
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,760
...is a crime page!

1050
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:42,160
Death is hovering over Sarada Sadan

1051
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,440
If I lose my patience...

1052
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,240
...you'll lose your home

1053
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,440
I'm not a bad person

1054
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,720
But don't assume
I'm a good person

1055
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,280
Whether you understand
or misunderstand...

1056
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,080
'He set a hospital on fire
just to finish off his enemy'

1057
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,880
'This Gayatri Patel was responsible
for the death of 132 people'

1058
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,320
Evidence related to this case...

1059
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,640
...CC camera footage has already
been submitted to this court

1060
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,720
'You look ditto like our boss'

1061
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,680
Even God cannot find out

1062
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,600
Past 25 years I had wondered
if I'll find my daughter or not

1063
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:22,600
And when I was about to meet her,
Gayatri Patel came in-between

1064
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,760
Do you think I'll get bail fast?

1065
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,080
Hey, brother

1066
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,480
On the stand is a tiger

1067
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,240
No chance of conviction

1068
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,560
Mr Gayatri Patel,
do you plead guilty?

1069
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,080
I don't, Mr Justice!

1070
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,480
How is it?

1071
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,000
Isn't killing 132 people a crime?

1072
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,800
In the great epic Ramayana,
Lord Rama and king Ravana fought

1073
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,320
It would have been appropriate
if they both fought and 1 of them died

1074
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,880
But the war which was
started because of them...

1075
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,200
...1000s of soldiers died
in the factions of both the armies

1076
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,880
Similarly in Mahabarata...

1077
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:03,400
...the war was waged only between
the Pandavas and Kauravas

1078
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:07,240
If they had fought and if 1 of them
had died, it would've been alright

1079
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,240
But the war that ensued
because of them...

1080
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:14,120
...millions of soldiers died
in the factions of both the armies

1081
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,320
Mine is also a very similar story

1082
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:24,720
In the process of killing
Akshara Patel, 132 people died

1083
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:28,120
If what they did in these 2 epics
is considered a crime...

1084
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,640
...then what I've done here is wrong too

1085
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,600
If they were not punished then...

1086
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,480
...then why should I be punished here?

1087
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,120
If they are regarded
as divine deities there...

1088
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,280
...then I am also God here

1089
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:46,120
Whether you understand
or misunderstand...

1090
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,840
'After all that has happened
the accused shows no remorse'

1091
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,280
'And if he's let out into this world'

1092
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,640
'...it will be truly dangerous!'

1093
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,800
'Therefore...'

1094
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,400
'...Gayatri Patel is pronounced guilty'

1095
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,680
'As per section 302...'

1096
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,880
'...he will be sentenced to death'

1097
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:28,080
Will you challenge
this verdict in High Court?

1098
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,440
My client won't be
appealing in any higher court

1099
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,800
Not appeal even to the Supreme Court

1100
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,360
Like how Bhagat Singh
accepted death sentence...

1101
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,760
...Gayatri Patel has accepted it
in the same way too

1102
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,680
How, sir?
Won't he die?

1103
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,440
Who will die
and who will live?

1104
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,680
It's only God's choice

1105
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,280
Thank you for accepting, Sivaji!

1106
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,920
Why are you giving me a prisoner's uniform?

1107
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,720
Hello, will a prisoner be given
a policeman's uniform instead?

1108
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,480
Jyothi, nice joke, right?

1109
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,840
Sir, am I not a remand prisoner?

1110
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,720
Jyothi, he's joking again

1111
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,760
I think he has a good sense of humor

1112
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,360
Do you know something?

1113
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,000
This News is on a loop
in every TV channel

1114
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:15,120
Watch it

1115
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,240
'Take a look'

1116
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,680
'Like how Bhagat Singh
accepted death sentence...'

1117
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,640
'...Gayatri Patel has accepted it
in the same way too'

1118
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,480
You agreed there and
why are you acting here?

1119
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,320
Shyamala, what's happening here?

1120
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,800
He has lost it because
of his death sentence

1121
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:30,800
- Jailer sir
- All of you wait outside

1122
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,360
Yes, tell me

1123
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,280
Sir, I was tricked and
got implicated in this case

1124
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,920
I'm not Gayatri Patel, sir

1125
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,520
Sivaji, stage actor

1126
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,800
He threatened to kill my children
and that's why-

1127
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,240
You are not Gayatri Patel

1128
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,320
I know you are Sivaji

1129
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,760
Money has taken the world on lease!

1130
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:53,000
There's nothing that money cannot buy

1131
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,480
Hello, sir

1132
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,200
Sivaji wants to speak to you

1133
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,280
Why did you trick me like this?

1134
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,280
Ramayana was the result of
a woman's rivulet of tears

1135
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,760
Mahabharat was the outcome
of a woman's vengeful laughter

1136
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:15,400
Gayatri Patel's death sentence was
because a girl turned into a witness

1137
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,080
Do you know who that girl is?

1138
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,880
Your daughter!

1139
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,480
I'm the eye witness

1140
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:30,360
To kill Akshara Patel in the ICU,
why go through all this trouble?

1141
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,080
If you kill 1 man,
it is a murder

1142
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,560
If you destroy the entire hospital,
it is an accident!

1143
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:37,840
Hey, who are you?

1144
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,080
Who is Gayatri Patel?

1145
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,200
Why did you set the hospital on fire, huh?

1146
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,320
Knowing hundreds of people will die
they set the hospital ablaze!

1147
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:00,760
Babies, doctors, so many
innocent people lost their lives

1148
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,080
Even if influential people
are behind this tragedy...

1149
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:04,600
...no one should be spared

1150
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,240
Justice has to be served!

1151
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,800
In the Mumbai bomb blast case...

1152
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,760
...when a witch-hunt
was on for the offenders

1153
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,640
...Dawood Ibrahim pulled the strings

1154
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:17,560
In the case where your
daughter was witness...

1155
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,280
...when they investigated
for the brain behind this tragedy

1156
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:21,800
...they found me

1157
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:26,640
I brought Sekar into the loop
to make a deal with you

1158
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,080
'Tell him the offer is 10 million'

1159
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,560
You turned me down

1160
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,440
Why go through this hassle?

1161
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,600
So I decided to kidnap the witness

1162
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,720
But you saved her

1163
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,720
Unexpected turn of events

1164
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:47,000
Only then it was revealed
she's your daughter

1165
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,200
Both for you

1166
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,440
And for me

1167
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,480
Plan took a U-turn

1168
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:00,000
Your daughter was hell bent on
making me pay for my crime

1169
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,240
I brought the same noose...

1170
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,160
...tighten around your neck

1171
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:13,480
You should not wage a war
when you should call a truce, Sivaji

1172
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:18,800
Until your last breath
keep inhaling as Gayatri Patel

1173
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,480
If you refuse and create havoc
insisting you are Sivaji...

1174
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,480
...your daughter will
stop breathing here!

1175
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,200
'I'm not a bad person'

1176
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,080
'But don't assume
I'm a good person'

1177
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:39,080
'Whether you understand
or misunderstand'

1178
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:12,600
"Welcome, o' king of enticement"

1179
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,080
"Admirer, write with commitment
'Kama Sutra' commandment"

1180
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:23,440
"My innocent age as inducement
Fresh white page as attachment"

1181
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:05,840
"Parakeet so colorful
Trousseau so flavorful"

1182
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,200
"Lord of Love, take your pick delightful"

1183
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:14,600
"When a glam-doll in a checked sari
fell on you provocatively"

1184
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:18,880
"To sway in a world of delight
hold her close to you real tight"

1185
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:22,720
"Ganges flows in spate
as nectar on lips to taste"

1186
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,360
"Quench your thirst intensely
Appreciating every move intently"

1187
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:32,200
"She has selected a special feast
From head to toe, a beautiful treat"

1188
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:34,720
So be it!

1189
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:38,520
"Parakeet so beautiful
Trousseau so bountiful"

1190
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,760
"Lord of Love, take your pick colorful"

1191
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,840
"When a glam-doll in a checked sari
fell on you temptingly"

1192
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,240
"Hold her close and allow
waves of passion to flow"

1193
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:21,800
"Change into a peacock feather
Stroke my back in swirls of pleasure"

1194
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:25,920
"To make my heart beat faster
wink at me, you naughty lover"

1195
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:30,440
"Change into a peacock feather
Caress my back with love at leisure"

1196
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:34,640
"To make my heart beat faster
wink at me, you smooth operator"

1197
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:38,920
"No other man here
has your temerity, dear"

1198
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
"I am a tender shoot, cool and calm
bearing the onslaught of your storm"

1199
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:47,880
"Just once if you touch me
for a hundred years I feel dizzy"

1200
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:50,640
Bravo!

1201
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,120
Are you so well endowed?

1202
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:56,280
"Parakeet so colorful
Trousseau so flavorful"

1203
01:43:56,360 --> 01:44:00,400
"Lord of Love, take your pick delightful"

1204
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,440
"My half sari's tussled end
sways in mid air astounded"

1205
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:43,720
"This queen's blouse is a-waiting
to be disrobed; checkmating"

1206
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:48,120
"My half sari's tussled end
sways in mid air dumbfounded"

1207
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:52,480
"This queen's blouse wants to slip & slide
silk and shiny to fall on the floor aside"

1208
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:56,800
"How long will I wait in rapture?
Don't stop my waves of pleasure?"

1209
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:01,000
"Come close to me
Turn off the light quickly"

1210
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:05,720
"Drink the ambrosia I offer
to be satiated forever"

1211
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:12,120
"Parakeet so beautiful
Trousseau so bountiful"

1212
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:16,440
"Lord of Love, take your pick fruitful"

1213
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:20,760
"When a glam-doll in a checked sari
fell on you rapturously"

1214
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,920
"For adrenalin rush enchanting
hold her tight enthralling"

1215
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,320
What is this, Gayatri?

1216
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,080
Are you meeting Sivaji's daughter
disguised as Sivaji?

1217
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,600
Why take this unnecessary risk?

1218
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,800
Lawyer

1219
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,360
If she doesn't see her father
she'll be sad for a day

1220
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,600
The next day she will start
wondering where he is

1221
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,240
The 3rd day she will
start making enquiries

1222
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,200
She'll find out the man in jail
isn't Gayatri Patel

1223
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,720
If she gets to know
he is her real father

1224
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,240
...our plans will all be screwed up!

1225
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:58,080
Let us kill her, Patel

1226
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,720
Sivaji will listen to us
only as long as his daughter is alive

1227
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,680
When the field is gaining in yield
let us fence the land

1228
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,520
On the day of the harvest
when the grains are ripe...

1229
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,800
...we will raise our sickle
and reap our reward!

1230
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,080
I hope you understand my plan

1231
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,200
My dear prince!

1232
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,800
Sivaji's image

1233
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:30,920
'Lawyer, when I go there
I don't want any witnesses around'

1234
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,560
Where is Sekar?

1235
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,680
Tell me the truth
Where is Sivaji?

1236
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,760
If death came knocking at my door...

1237
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,840
...you have come in search of death!

1238
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,040
Father!

1239
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,160
I misunderstood you

1240
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:48,040
Please forgive me, nana

1241
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:51,360
I never even imagined
I would meet you, father

1242
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:58,360
Don't be scared, dear

1243
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,120
They are here for your security

1244
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,680
Only for this happy day to dawn...

1245
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,760
...for 25 long years
I've been looking forward

1246
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,640
Prasad uncle has
gone in search of you

1247
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:14,120
I saw him, I've entrusted him
with some other task

1248
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,280
Let's go in

1249
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,160
I heard you're leaving for the States

1250
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,320
Can I also come with you, dear?

1251
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:23,080
What kind of question is that?
You have to stay with me

1252
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:25,160
Wherever I go
you should also come

1253
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,320
Why did you send for me, Sivaji?

1254
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:34,000
To confess, huh?

1255
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,760
25 years ago, to save
my wife and unborn baby...

1256
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,680
I chose this option

1257
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,320
The moment I saw my daughter
I decided to reform my ways

1258
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,920
But...

1259
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,320
...to rescue her
from that Gayatri Patel

1260
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,760
...I was forced to don this disguise again

1261
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:59,480
The daughter and orphans you tried
to save by enacting this role...

1262
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,680
...Gayatri Patel has gone to
see them, disguised as you!

1263
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,040
He has killed Sekar and
your friend Sivaparasad

1264
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:13,080
He has blocked all avenues, Sivaji

1265
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,440
Will you do me a favor
as a journalist?

1266
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:33,640
Hey! What is that?

1267
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:35,800
Like pulling the plug
from a patient in ICU...

1268
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,760
...you paused your story
at the crucial page

1269
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,040
Then what happened?

1270
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:40,600
Even I know
only till that page, sir

1271
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:42,320
You know only till then?

1272
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,880
Will you do me a favor?

1273
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,080
I'll be happy to help

1274
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,480
If you want, you can take
the help of media totally

1275
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,360
What did Sivaji tell you?

1276
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,680
You're stepping into the danger zone

1277
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,000
Be careful

1278
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,880
'Like a scenthound has she found out
I have come disguised as Sivaji?'

1279
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,240
'I am telling you
Move aside'

1280
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,880
'Won't you take 'no' for an answer?'

1281
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:33,840
'Allow us to step inside'

1282
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,160
'We are reporters'

1283
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:40,240
Gayatri has been instrumental in
sending a criminal to the gallows

1284
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:43,160
You are preventing us
from telling the world about it

1285
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:45,880
'Let us in'

1286
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,760
My daughter's life is in danger

1287
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:51,000
Even an assassin can come
in the guise of a journalist

1288
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:53,000
If you want an interview...

1289
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:54,600
...I'll meet just one of you

1290
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,520
Mr Sivaji, you're a renowned stage artiste

1291
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,120
Your daughter is also a very brave girl

1292
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:06,880
Her evidence helped to send Gayatri Patel
a dangerous criminal to the gallows

1293
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,920
The man in front of you
is not your father Sivaji

1294
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:16,480
Your father who is in jail, in the guise
of Gayatri will be sentenced to death

1295
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,000
Media vehicles are on standby

1296
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,160
If you escape
we can rescue your dad

1297
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:23,520
Not only that, Gayatri Patel has
killed your uncle Prasad too

1298
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,480
If you're in doubt
look at the book in front of you

1299
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,880
Are you mad or what?

1300
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,240
You are accusing my father
of being an impostor?

1301
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,320
Look at this, nana

1302
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,760
She claims you aren't Sivaji
But Gayatri Patel

1303
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,920
The world today believes
any propaganda by the media

1304
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:08,360
Using the media as a tool
claiming you're Gayatri Patel

1305
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,880
...they are planning to
send you to the gallows

1306
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:15,800
Tell Gayatri Patel I won't fall
for all these clever ploys by the media

1307
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:22,440
25 years

1308
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:25,480
I have found my daughter
after searching for 25 years

1309
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,920
For her higher studies
and a bright future...

1310
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,760
...we are leaving for the States

1311
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:33,080
By hassling us
at this point of time

1312
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:36,200
...please don't mess up our travel plans

1313
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:54,080
You planned to save your daughter
with the help of the entire press and media

1314
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:55,520
But it didn't work out

1315
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:57,880
Your last attempt also ended in failure

1316
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,000
Before you die at least
ask your last wish properly

1317
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:03,400
Shyamala, find out his last wish

1318
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:07,640
What do you want?

1319
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:09,120
'Biriyani' from Dasapalla?

1320
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,800
'Halim' from Salim bhai?

1321
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,160
Toddy with appetizer near
Muththyalamma temple?

1322
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,120
Last wish, right?
Go ahead

1323
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:19,760
I want to text a message

1324
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,520
Jothi, message it seems

1325
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,520
Last wish
We'll grant it for you

1326
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:25,480
All yours
Call whomever

1327
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,120
Shyamala, what's his last wish?

1328
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,760
He wanted to text a message
I gave him my phone

1329
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,320
Take the phone back from him

1330
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:51,600
'Sreshta, my last wish is to
watch Sivaji's acting prowess'

1331
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:57,240
'Criminal Gayatri Patel asks
to watch Sivaji's play'

1332
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:58,800
'Authorities say they will try'

1333
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:00,680
His last wish
comes as a surprise!

1334
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:02,520
'Gayatri Patel's last wish'

1335
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:07,160
'Since Gayatri Patel hasn't
submitted his mercy petition'

1336
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,800
'...he is prepared to die'

1337
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:11,720
'On humanitarian grounds
his last wish should be fulfilled'

1338
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:15,360
'Sivaji will set a sterling example
if he fulfills Gayatri Patel's last wish'

1339
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:18,440
'Sivaji was the one who rescued
your granddaughter, nana'

1340
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:19,680
'He's a wonderful man'

1341
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:22,400
'Gayatri Patel's last wish
to watch Sivaji act'

1342
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:25,680
'...is being supported by
social media in a big way'

1343
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,120
'WhatsApp, Facebook and
Instagram are overloaded'

1344
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:30,640
'...with messages urging Sivaji to comply'

1345
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,680
To proclaim to the world
I've replaced him

1346
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:42,560
...I know this is a ruse
carried out by Sivaji

1347
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,080
Book my flight to USA today

1348
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,160
My dear prince!
You are soooper!

1349
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:51,120
Gayatri Patel doesn't intend
leaving us in peace, nana

1350
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:53,800
- We should fly to USA immediately
- I agree, dear

1351
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:03,800
Take care of the children
till Prasad returns

1352
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,120
Okay, sir

1353
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:06,680
Get into the car, dear

1354
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,040
'However hardcore a criminal may be...'

1355
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,400
'...it is humanitarian concern
to fulfil his last wish'

1356
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:28,240
'But Sivaji is travelling to the US
with his daughter ignoring this plea'

1357
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:31,120
'Gayatri Patel's last wish
To be fulfilled'

1358
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,920
[shouting slogans]

1359
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:38,080
'You're leaving without fulfilling
Gayatri Patel's last wish, sir'

1360
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,680
Sir, just answer

1361
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,880
We even have the court's
permission letter

1362
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,320
You can come and perform, sir

1363
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:46,400
There's no necessity for my father
to act in front of anyone

1364
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:48,040
You carry on

1365
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:50,400
'- Sivaji
- Should act!'

1366
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:57,480
Mr Sivaji, fulfil Gayatri Patel's last wish

1367
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,680
Prove you have humanitarian concern

1368
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:05,000
Sivaji, when I used to ask you
'Want food or make-up?'

1369
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,920
As a child you used to say
'I prefer make-up over food'

1370
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:13,480
When a man's last wish
is to see your performance...

1371
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,240
...will you just ignore
and go away to USA?

1372
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:19,240
Actually are you really
the Sivaji I knew?

1373
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,160
Father

1374
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,640
If you don't fulfil his last dying wish

1375
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,240
...your character will be tarnished
as a heartless person

1376
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,840
I don't wish that for you

1377
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,680
Do this for him, father

1378
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:40,920
Mr Gayatri

1379
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,480
As the jailer I am saying this

1380
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,560
Come, there's nothing to fear

1381
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,400
We'll stand by his side
and tighten the noose!

1382
01:56:57,160 --> 01:57:00,200
Only now you've proved
you're my Sivaji, son

1383
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:24,320
Father?

1384
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:44,200
Father!

1385
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:17,040
Daughter of an actor, right?

1386
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:26,120
Sreshta ma'am

1387
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:27,920
I was worried
for our children's safety

1388
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:30,000
That's why I was so rude to you

1389
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:41,000
What is this extra dose of confidence
between father and daughter?

1390
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:43,920
How will you escape?

1391
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:49,200
Jyothi, I'll call back
It's a confused drama situation here

1392
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,480
This jail is my guest house

1393
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:53,760
That jailer is my watchman

1394
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,040
I have strength

1395
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:57,880
Manpower

1396
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,560
And money

1397
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:02,120
Enough clout in my pocket

1398
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:04,840
What do you have?

1399
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,400
Goodness of heart!

1400
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:12,680
'Sivaji was the one who rescued
your granddaughter, nana'

1401
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,440
'He's a wonderful man'

1402
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:16,400
His child went missing

1403
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,160
While searching for his daughter...

1404
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:21,880
...he has reunited so many lost children
to their parents who were traumatized

1405
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,400
My granddaughter is
one such missing child

1406
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:27,240
By uniting this father-daughter duo...

1407
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,160
...I want to fulfil my debt
of gratitude I owe him

1408
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:33,480
The noose tightens not around Sivaji's neck

1409
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,080
But yours, Gayatri

1410
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:46,680
Jailer, you saved my daughter and me

1411
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:49,920
I didn't save you, Sivaji

1412
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:52,720
Your good deeds and
good karma rescued you

1413
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:10,440
Father!

1414
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:53,080
Can't distinguish one from the other

1415
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:11,400
Cut my hair to resemble
Sivaji's hair style

1416
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:51,560
Uncle, save my father, please

1417
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:54,360
How do I identify?
They look like Vali and Sugriva!

1418
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,440
You identify your father for me

1419
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:07,440
"Victory to the great Shiva, 3 eyed
who has fire burning on his forehead"

1420
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:14,120
"Which is increased by the snake's breath
wandering in the sky at length"

1421
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:21,440
"And to Him who dances all around
to the changing tunes and fierce sound"

1422
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:28,800
"Of dhimi, dhimi, dhimi momentum
coming out the auspicious drum"

1423
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:34,040
"Praise be to Lord Siva
Creator of all arts, Natraja"

1424
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:36,560
Uncle, he is my father

1425
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:38,000
That is Gayatri Patel

1426
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:46,880
"I adore Shiva, who supports the lotus blue"

1427
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,640
"Around His neck's girdle to blossom anew"

1428
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:57,160
"The destroyer of Kamadeva
Annihilator of Pura"

1429
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:03,280
"Of mundane existence
and Daksha's sacrifice"

1430
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,320
"Praise be to Shiva, destroyer of evil"

1431
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:09,040
"Praise be to Lord Shiva, the primordial"

1432
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:12,480
"Praise be to Lord Shiva
Father of Ganesha"

1433
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:26,920
Father!

1434
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,200
My dear!

1435
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:01,680
I don't know what karmic bond this is
to die in your hands, dear

1436
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:12,160
What happened here, Shyamala?

1437
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:15,240
Sivaji came here to fulfil
Gayatri Patel's last wish

1438
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:18,480
Gayatri who tried to escape by
trapping Sivaji was shot by our police

1439
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:20,240
Your promotion is guaranteed

1440
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:21,240
Thanks, sir

1441
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,560
Jyothi, heard that?
I'm being promoted

1442
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:25,000
So will you

1443
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,880
'I prayed to be reunited
with my daughter''

1444
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:37,880
'God blessed me with a mother!'

1445
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:41,200
'I can never be an orphan hereafter'
