Greetings, professor

5
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,670
Hope you are doing fine

6
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:39,264
Huh, I'm sure you're doing good

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,360
After all you've been pimping out college
girls to those in power and in politics

8
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,600
My guy is waiting outside
your home...

9
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:49,983
with audio recordings of your calls
with your students

10
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,646
I don't need your money

11
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,600
I want the list of all those to
whom you pimped out your students

12
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:59,217
Go get that parcel and check it out

13
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Madam!

14
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,880
Hello, madam!

15
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,520
Bro, the parcel hasn't
been delivered yet

16
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,520
The delivery guy is disconnecting my calls

17
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,840
Seemed like he has
something else in his mind

18
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,160
I think he is up to something

19
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,520
Now, what should I do?

20
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,640
Dude, check who is it

21
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
Who is it?

22
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
It's Maari

23
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:11,512
Hello

24
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:13,941
A small work.
Would you like to take it up?

25
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,277
I'm sleeping, chief

26
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,710
Get this done and you'll
get double pay than usual

27
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,831
What does he want?

28
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,280
He says he'll double up the pay

29
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
Fine, tell him we'll do it

30
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,240
Okay, chief.
Send me the location

31
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:29,277
I'll Whatsapp it to you

32
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,040
He said he'll pay up Rs. 20,000!

33
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,520
Usually he'll make us toil
hard for a mere Rs. 5,000

34
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,880
Must be some rich house

35
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,120
Whatever. We'll just do the job and
flick some costly items for ourselves

36
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, as good it may sound, the
petty thefts never bothered us much

37
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,840
Well, now that we've decided to go for
it, let make the best out it. Come on

38
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,640
Hey! Careful

39
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,360
Siddhu!

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,960
Chief, we did it on your orders

64
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,040
What's going on?

65
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,560
I just heard the news

66
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,720
Chief, this looks quite serious

67
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Our job there was a different
agenda but something else happened

68
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
What's our fault in this?

69
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Just forget it

70
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,880
What if only we both get caught?

71
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,280
Hear me out carefully

72
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,920
I think you're doubting me

73
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,880
Turn yourselves in if you guys want

74
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,720
I don't have any problem if you rat me out

75
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,880
I'll be out within 10 days

76
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
You both are student.
So, think about it

77
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,720
Fine, we'll discuss that later.
Did you finish the job?

78
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
Chief, well...

79
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,680
You didn't even finish the job?
What the heck were you doing?

80
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,240
Shouldn't have given you that job!
Now, hang up!

81
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,880
What do we do now?

82
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,080
- Why is he weeping?
- It was his friend

83
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,800
- Got him in your list?
- Already inquired him, sir

84
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
He owns a construction company it seems

85
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,600
Guys who broke in were petty thieves

86
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,480
They were trying to steal
gadgets like mobile, computer

87
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,280
But chickened out and left them

88
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,360
The tea shop guy claims that he saw 2 guys

89
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Hold on. Wait. The officer
will come and update

90
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,560
Sir, any information
regarding the murder?

91
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,720
Sir, day by day such murders
are on the increase

92
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,280
Sir, just a minute.
Please answer me

93
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,200
What is the motto
behind this murder, sir?

94
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,680
Sir, over here.
Just a minute

95
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Two guys broke in thinking
the house was empty

96
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,640
The guy tried to stop them
and they murdered him

97
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,640
We have got proofs and one round
of investigation is already over

98
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,920
We'll nab the murderers soon

99
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,880
Sir, again the usual "Update
in 48 hrs" statement?

100
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,120
You'll anyway make this
murder the headlines

101
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,920
And if we crack the case, you'll just
print in some corner of the newspaper

102
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,040
The murderers will be soon behind the bars

103
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,000
- Sir! Sir! Just one more question
- We are done here. Leave!

104
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,200
It is assumed that 2 murderers reached
the crime spot at early morning...

105
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,040
and during the tussle that broke out, the
thieves murdered the person staying at home

106
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,440
As per the police statement

107
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
The tea shop employee who lived
nearby said he witnessed them escaping

108
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,000
"I will nab those 2 culprits
and make them answer to law"

109
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,760
A statement from Thiruvanmiyur
police officer, Chezian

110
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,560
What? We did it?
What's going on?

111
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,880
We are trapped and in a soup now!

112
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,360
Petty thefts were just fine but
you wanted make it big! Now look!

113
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,960
Look what Maari pushed us into

114
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,600
You! Say something!

115
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,160
No Adhi...

116
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
Something's wrong.

117
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,360
Someone else is playing the game

118
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,760
Remember the victim's friend?

119
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Why would he finish him
off, that too over there?

120
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,120
First, we must find out at
what time he was murdered

121
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,280
The police knows only the time of our
escape and not the time we broke in

122
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,760
We got only one way out of this mess

123
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,840
Before police nabs us we
must find the real murderer

124
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,600
That's again unnecessary!

125
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Let's just take some
off time and abscond!

126
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
Stop talking like you're crazy!

127
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,160
Do you thing they'll not
find us if we abscond?

128
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,720
The guy who passed by
in bicycle saw us

129
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,000
And the inspector claims
he has proofs against us

130
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,560
A small doubt and you know
how the police treats.

131
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
We went there to steal!

132
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,680
On top of all, from the police till
media, everyone are smart and aware

133
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,280
If, by chance, we get caught...

134
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,280
neither can we prove ourselves
not guilty nor can we escape

135
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,840
In any case the cops will nab us

136
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,520
I don't have a good feeling about this.
Hereafter, you obey my words! Got it?

137
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,080
Let's stay quiet for few days

138
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,640
Let's follow that victim's friend

139
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,040
If we sense that police are nearing us
then we'll rat out Maari

140
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Okay, right

141
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,320
When he called me...

142
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,960
I must have attended his call

143
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
If I was home...

144
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,960
then I should be the one...

145
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,160
dead!

146
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,600
They could have robbed everything
and anything from here...

147
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,520
...but they must not
have murdered him

148
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,640
None will be spared

149
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,840
Doesn't matter who is
it, none will be spared

150
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,080
Dinesh...what's wrong?

151
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,480
Why are you upset?

152
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,960
Don't keep thinking about it. Just leave it

153
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
No, Raadhi!

154
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,320
If I was the one dead, do you think
my parents would've been quiet?

155
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,000
If he had someone, they'd
have got him justice at least

156
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,640
I am the only one who
was there for him

157
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,280
His absence makes me
realize it, Raadhi

158
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Tell me

159
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,760
- Dinesh, right?
- Yes

160
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,800
Didn't you say that only the victim,
Sampath and you stayed here?

161
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,040
Well sir, he'd be very upset
if he's alone. Hence...

162
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,360
Oh, I see. And you are?

163
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,480
A family friend. We're
planning to get married

164
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,400
- Where are you from?
- Thanjavur, sir

165
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,600
Parents have settled in US

166
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,040
Since, when are you here

167
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,880
It's been 4 years since I bought this house

168
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,240
Parents stay here
whenever they visit

169
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Yearly once

170
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,560
What do you do?

171
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,800
Buddha construction belongs to my dad

172
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,280
We are taking care of it

173
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,880
How long since you know
the victim, Sampath?

174
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,840
We studied together since childhood

175
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,560
His parents were farmers

176
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,840
They committed suicide

177
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,640
When I found that out, I
took him in ever since that

178
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,200
He completed engineering but somehow he
wasn't interested in working in that field

179
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,160
He reads a lot and has
written a few books too

180
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,280
He wanted to become a successful writer

181
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,080
Recently he took up a part time job

182
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,680
Part time job?
Where?

183
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
I don't know, sir

184
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,880
He'd set out saying it is
some delivery business

185
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,120
Since I didn't like him
taking up that job...

186
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,560
I didn't inquire much about it

187
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,240
Fine, where were you last night?

188
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,920
There was a small office party last night

189
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,560
I had been to it

190
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,200
Do you doubt anyone?

191
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,560
I don't have any doubts, sir...

192
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sure it was those thieves

193
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,360
Okay, Dinesh...

194
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,800
Coperate with us.
Please come if you summon you

195
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,920
Sure, sir

196
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Hey!

197
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,760
Isn't this Sampath's phone?

198
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,160
Hello

199
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
No, thanks

200
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,960
Customer care

201
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,760
As of today it's 4 days
since Sampath is no more

202
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,960
Not even a single call from the office
where we worked as delivery boy

203
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,120
Thought I'll check his
call logs and report

204
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,720
But all the calls were web calls

205
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,960
Told you no to ponder over
it and move on.

206
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Forget it!

207
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,920
Sir...

208
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,160
I did a thorough check.

209
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,160
He was at that party
the whole night

210
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
They claim he stepped
out for 10 minutes

211
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,080
Turns out he was on a video call
with is parents, who live abroad

212
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,320
Details are here in this pen drive.

213
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,560
Apart from these, he's
always been in office

214
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Sure, sir.

215
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,200
- Okay, Saba
- Okay, sir

216
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,320
- Let's go
- Okay, sir

217
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,800
- Any update on the autopsy report?
- I hear it's ready, sir

218
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,480
All the evidences point towards
us yet they are following him

219
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,400
So, like us, even the police doubts him

220
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,320
He has done something.
For sure!

221
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Sir!

222
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,120
The autopsy report says the murderers
have executed the perfect crime

223
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,600
Doesn't look like newbies

224
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,160
- Bharani
- Sir

225
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Hello

226
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,440
There's one delivery to be done.
Interested?

227
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,160
- No thanks, chief
- What happened?

228
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,360
We have stopped it

229
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
I'll ensure that you guys
won't face any issue

230
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,720
Let me call you back, chief

231
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
What is it?

232
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,960
It was Maari

233
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,200
What else would he call us for?

234
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,960
Dinesh!

235
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,760
What are you up to?

236
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
Raadhi...

237
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,680
someone else came here
before the thieves broke in

238
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
How do you say?

239
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,560
As per the autopsy, Sampath died at 11:20

240
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,760
I was with him on that until 9:30

241
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,520
We had been to dinner, as usual

242
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,720
That's when he received a call from
the company where he works part time

243
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,560
Tell me, sir

244
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,600
Can I finish my dinner
and start in 5 minutes?

245
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,840
Okay, sir

246
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,200
Dude, an urgent delivery.
He's waiting nearby our home

247
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,280
Please drop me at home

248
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,600
Told you that job sucks and
you want me to drop you?

249
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,680
- Told you to join my office!
- Let me try on my own first

250
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,400
If I don't get
anything, I shall join

251
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,520
Shall we go now?

252
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,680
I really don't like you
doing this, I'm telling you

253
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,080
I was getting late for office
party, so I left to pick you up

254
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,160
When we were at the party,
Sampath had called me at 11

255
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,920
I couldn't attend and then later
I returned his call around 11:30

256
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,920
He didn't pick the call and by then he was
dead. That's what the autopsy report says too

257
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,360
The thieves jumped out
of the house at 3:30

258
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,600
The house was in a mess

259
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,240
Blood stains on the stairs. They got
scared on seeing the corpse and ran away

260
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,520
11:20 to 3:30

261
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,800
Almost 4 hours the broke in to
steal but left without anything.

262
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,960
So, why'd they come here?

263
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,520
If they were not here for money
or jewels then what could it be?

264
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,480
Sampath used to get regular calls
from that delivery company

265
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,000
The company must have contacted him
in either case, if he's dead or alive

266
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,240
I checked his phone logs and all
the company calls were web calls

267
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Raadhi...

268
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,640
definitely someone else
came in before the thieves

269
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,520
Are web calls traceable?

270
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,600
Constable, looks like
the inspector is upset

271
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
He wants us to close the file but
not so easy to find the criminals!

272
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
- After all it's our job
- Drats

273
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,760
- Sir
- Yes?

274
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,600
I was travelling in his rickshaw,
a bike guy snatched away my mobile

275
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,760
Why were so careless?

276
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,600
Go file the complaint
with the writer

277
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Please sit

278
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Where are you coming from?
Where did the incident happen?

279
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,360
How many were there? 1 or 2?
Did you notice them?

280
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,240
Did you see their bike number?
Write down each and every detail

281
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
What's the case?

282
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,000
I was travelling in his rickshaw,
a bike guy snatched away my mobile

283
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
Locality?

284
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,200
Thiruvanmiyur

285
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Okay, sit

286
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,200
- Where in Thiruvanmiyur?
- Rajagopalan street

287
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,920
Guys who broke in were petty thieves

288
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,640
They were trying to steal gadgets
like mobile, computer...

289
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,680
- Bharani
- Sir? Coming, sir

290
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,400
- We got the robbery case list, right?
- Yes, sir

291
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,080
- Get me that
- Okay, sir

292
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,680
Any update on the autopsy
report I asked for?

293
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Around what time?

294
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,320
Confirm?

295
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,360
Well, the victim was my friend.
Hence...

296
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,320
Okay

297
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,720
J-6 station receiving, sir

298
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,920
Sir...

299
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,680
Professor committed suicide

300
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,520
- Reason?
- Don't know yet, sir

301
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,720
The calls she had with her girl students
were tapped and since it leaked...

302
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,320
Some files have been burnt down

303
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,720
The TV has been running

304
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:51,280
"What you have to do is....like
they expect something..."

305
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:59,080
"so to meet those need and get it done
successfully...college girls...."

306
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,120
"they expect something from
college girls like you"

307
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,760
"I am doing my.... Like I have
never stooped to this level ever"

308
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,360
"I can only tell you this much...
Like few things..."

309
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,200
"and I believe that you
too will understand it"

310
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,640
"So, they expect something from you"

311
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,080
Dinesh, check out this news

312
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,720
The PPT professor committed suicide

313
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,560
She lives in our locality

314
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,920
Back to back deaths under mysterious
condition. Are they murder or suicide?

315
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,200
Who leaked the professor's
call recordings?

316
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,120
Who gave the police the rights to expose
the details of the girl who spoke to her?

317
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,680
Does the situation demand a CBI
investigation? Who all will be exposed?

318
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,320
Like "murder for political benefit", is "murder
for power" starting to rise in Tami Nadu?

319
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:51,056
Today's show of "Let's talk politics"
continues with many such questions

320
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:55,623
Answer me this. Why do you keep
dragging CBI in to every silly thing?

321
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,376
The suicide was due to depression and
her ethics failing in her profession

322
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,600
The investigation is going smooth

323
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,040
Then why drag the CBI? Why
are you talking like crazy?

324
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,829
Does the opponent party
have nothing better to do?

325
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,320
Truth must be exposed so it can be either
CBI investigation or police investigation

326
00:32:12,352 --> 00:32:14,152
I hold the government
responsible for the murders

327
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,640
No way!

328
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,950
There are some high profile people involved
as per the audio leaked

329
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
- Every murder has some high profile links
- Don't you add irrelevant names

330
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,400
We don't look at every such
incident as mere murders

331
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,280
It's all trash talk!

332
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,120
We look upon it as
the murder of democracy

333
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,920
All names mentioned in
those burnt files at the house...

334
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,520
...of professor who
committed suicide...

335
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,720
The complete truth must be out!

336
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Dude...

337
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,040
I doubt Maari

338
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,240
He sent us to that house on that day

339
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,400
We found a dead guy

340
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,280
He came with a new
delivery address yesterday

341
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,720
And today a professor
is dead in that address

342
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,920
If we had taken up that
job the other day...

343
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,800
...we'd be buried six feet under by now!

344
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,440
Adhi...

345
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,520
I somehow feel we must
take police's help

346
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
No Raadhi

347
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
The had executed it so perfect

348
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,040
We can't crack it, no
matter how much we try

349
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,560
My friend, Vishnu, is an ethical hacker

350
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,560
How about we get his help?

351
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,000
All I hear is murder and suicide.
What's going on?

352
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,120
- What progress have you made?
- Sir, investigation is on

353
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,360
We'll nab the culprits soon

354
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,840
Yeah, the same old answer!

355
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,800
Too much pressure from the top management

356
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,720
Our locality has been the
hot topic for past 2 months

357
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,600
On top of that, don't
get me started on media

358
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,880
Fine, what's your progress?

359
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,720
Doesn't look like the usual gangsters.
Looks like some new, inexperienced guys

360
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,560
They murdered him, chickened out
and left the loot there itself

361
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,640
We only found petty electronic items
in their bags they left there

362
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,960
I've almost zeroed in on them.
We'll nab them

363
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,400
I'm just waiting for a small loop hole

364
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,760
Whatever it is, speed up.
I have a meeting today evening

365
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Sure, sir

366
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,480
Let's go. Drive

367
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,560
Sir, our locality robbery
case file that you asked for

368
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Sir, most of the accused
in this file are caught

369
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,680
There are few cased that
are yet to be solved

370
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,160
Few involve students, hence the case has
not been registered and left pending

371
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,760
Fine, get me those unsolved case files

372
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,680
Sir, no stolen goods are flowing
in the market like before

373
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,080
No idea where the stolen
good are now sold off

374
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,760
The market is not the
same like before, Bharani

375
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,680
Digital India. There are websites
online to sell stolen goods

376
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,720
There are apps competing
to sell such goods

377
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,320
- You may leave
- Okay, sir

378
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,120
Raadhi, see here.
There is a way

379
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,800
We have an option to poke
back the web callers

380
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,520
If we call back the web number from which we
received a call, they'll get a notification

381
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,760
They can call us when they notice it

382
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,680
- Call that number now
- Dinesh, do it

383
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,720
Yes! The notification is sent

384
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,880
So, if he calls back Sampath after he
notices this notification then its normal

385
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,800
Your theories could be wrong

386
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,640
But if he keeps quiet even
after seeing this notification...

387
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,440
then something is fishy

388
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,320
They we got ourselves a big problem

389
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,760
Sir....

390
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,160
Sir, a report of phones sold from
our locality, in ALX online

391
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,760
The contact numbers of many phones
we doubt match the ones in these

392
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,760
There are the contacts of
buyer and seller in it

393
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,120
The contact of a person
name 'Siddarth' is frequent

394
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,600
I have marked those, sir

395
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,360
Okay, sir

396
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,320
Hello

397
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,680
J-6 inspector, Chezian here

398
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,560
I need the complete details
of a contact number

399
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,920
Tell me, sir

400
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,960
"9840508677"

401
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,520
I'll collect the details
and email it to you, sir

402
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,160
Okay, I shall wait

403
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,880
Was it him you saw?

404
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,920
Sir! That's him!

405
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,320
Why is Nisha calling?

406
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Hello

407
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Adhi, cops just came and left the
college in search of you guys

408
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,280
Okay

409
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,160
The cops are looking for us

410
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,400
What?

411
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,560
Raadhi! Come here!

412
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,000
See, he has received
our poke messages

413
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,360
He is reading it

414
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,880
He has read it for sure

415
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,240
It true that we broke into that house

416
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,240
But, we didn't murder him

417
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,400
How is it that you broke in exactly
to the house where murder took place?

418
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,320
We did petty thefts for our survival

419
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,400
Gadgets like laptops and cell
phones of our college students

420
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,120
Whatever we loot like that, we sell
them in ALX or directly in the market

421
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,680
That's where we befriended Maari

422
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,320
He started giving us small delivery jobs

423
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,400
We did that as a part time job

424
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,440
Since he knew us well...

425
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,080
On the 23rd, he asked us to steal a
blue cover parcel from that house

426
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,240
But when we jumped into
that house that day...

427
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,240
the rear door of that
house was open

428
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,280
As soon as we broke in...

429
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,440
we first stole all that
was essential for us

430
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,840
Then moved to the next room
in search of that parcel

431
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,280
But, we saw a corpse there

432
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,840
We were shocked and escaped at once

433
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,160
And that's when that tea
shop guy noticed us

434
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,240
We called up Maari to
explain what had happened

435
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,400
He further scared us

436
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,280
Turn yourselves in if you guys want

437
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,200
I don't have any problem if you rat me out

438
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,880
You both are student.
So, think about it

439
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,520
When he said that...

440
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,560
we were scared to
approach the police

441
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,720
We saw the headlines next
morning and were shocked!

442
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,080
What else have you done?

443
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,080
Since that incident we
stopped everything

444
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,520
We tried to find the murderer

445
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,680
But we couldn't

446
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,600
We didn't have a proper plan

447
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,280
So we thought of escaping from here

448
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,400
That's when...

449
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,600
you caught us

450
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,480
Please, our life will be ruined, sir

451
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,160
Please, sir

452
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,480
Even last week...

453
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,400
we were offered Rs. 10,000 to steal
a pen drive from the same locality

454
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,920
We refused

455
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,920
Pen drive? Which locality?

456
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,080
Thiruvanmiyur, sir

457
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
Date?

458
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,080
Sir, March 23rd

459
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,560
That's when our exams got over

460
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,800
Are you sure about the date?

461
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,160
Confirm, sir

462
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,440
- The pen drive that we got from professor's house
- Yes, sir

463
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,920
- Bring that
- Okay, sir

464
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,880
Call him again

465
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,040
Again! Again!

466
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,880
He received this poke too.
He has noticed it

467
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,360
Call him again

468
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,400
He noticed this one too

469
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,560
He is definitely noticing it
all but there is no response

470
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,480
Then according to you he's definitely got
something to do with Sampath's murder

471
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,920
- Right time to inform the police
- Yeah. Okay

472
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,000
Sir, it's me, Dinesh

473
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,760
Can we speak.  It's important

474
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,280
Dinesh, I'm busy with an important work.
Come to the station

475
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,360
Okay, sir

476
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,560
- Do you know Maari's house?
- Yes, sir

477
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,400
Do you think police would
take all these seriously?

478
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,000
I don't care. I am not resting
until I crack this, Raadhi

479
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,920
Raadhi!

480
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,720
He gave the parcel to Sampath on that day

481
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,000
Follow him!

482
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
Which one?

483
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
That rooftop

484
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,080
This is Maari's house. He must
be on his way from the market

485
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,920
Go fast! Go! Go!

486
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,560
Dinesh, stop!

487
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,720
Wait! Wait!

488
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,120
Raadhi, you go to the station.
I'll come

489
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,600
Fine, do keep me posted

490
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
Maari!

491
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,880
Dude, get him!

492
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,160
Arun...

493
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,200
Maari is done and dusted

494
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,480
Problem's no more

495
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,000
Okay

496
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
Sir...

497
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,680
In the middle of the road?

498
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,040
Se we have few doubts regarding the
accused in Sampath's murder case

499
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,640
Moreover, doesn't look like
those thieves murdered him

500
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,160
Someone else is involved

501
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,760
- What do you mean?
- Yes, sir

502
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,640
Let it remain confidential. Go down
and handle things. I'll follow

503
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,720
Okay, sir

504
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,920
Dinesh!

505
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,560
- Saba...
- Sir?

506
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,160
I had asked for the CCTV footage
from the deceased professor's house

507
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,400
On process, sir

508
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,600
- Get me that immediately
- Okay, sir

509
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,720
Sir...

510
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,040
- Selvam...
- Sir?

511
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,560
Need the complete call
history of this number

512
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,880
Okay, sir

513
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,680
Sir, mostly web calls and
there are also normal numbers

514
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,200
Get the id proofs of those numbers

515
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,920
Sir, normal numbers are quite
easily traceable but...

516
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,640
web calls....we can try

517
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
IP address?

518
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,360
We can nab the culprit
with IP address but...

519
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,520
if he's using it then definitely he'd
have used Poptax, Global phone, CG phone

520
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,320
Sure he'd have installed IP hacker

521
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,400
It's not like before. There are
many apps to make fake calls

522
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,760
So, it'd be quite tough, sir

523
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,080
Sir...

524
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,640
We can find the receiver's location

525
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,000
Superb Selvam!

526
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,480
Can you get a list of all the
web calls made in the city?

527
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,680
That'd be tough, sir because every
telemarketing call is made using web calls

528
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,800
- Can it be filtered?
- I can try, sir

529
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,520
Usual no one attends the spam calls

530
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,360
If attended, still the
calls won't last for long

531
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,600
Do one thing. Any web
calls above 5 minutes...

532
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,240
- Filter those alone
- Yes, sir

533
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,240
Sir...

534
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,880
the CCTV footage from
professor's house is here

535
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,360
Sir, the CCTV footage are
available on till March 22nd

536
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,960
All footage from 23rd is missing.
It's completely missing

537
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,800
To be exact, sine a week
before she committed suicide

538
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,280
March 22...

539
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,280
Sir...

540
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,840
can we locate Sampath's final location
before he came home the day he was murdered?

541
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,400
Sir, except from Meghna's locality,
everyone else are caught

542
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,600
Everyone has Maari's name on their lip

543
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,920
Sir, they belong to Maari's group

544
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,160
The are faking it saying they are
delivery boys and just went to deliver

545
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,720
Sir, we don't belong to Maari's group.

546
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,200
We went to him after seeing
an part time job poster

547
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,520
He'll give us the package and pay
us for delivering. That's it

548
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,800
Sir, we delivered all
that on Maari's orders

549
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,800
Why are you all quiet?
Speak up!

550
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,120
Sir, I'm a photographer

551
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,800
Sir, we both are engineering students

552
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,560
Sir, we had to pay our fees
hence the part time job

553
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,160
I am Maari's neighbour.
I work in a fast food outlet

554
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,920
He asks me to deliver packages
and then pays up. That's all

555
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,320
Sir, I'm looking for a job

556
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,840
Sir, I'm a cab driver

557
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,440
I drive a share auto rickshaw

558
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,880
At Avadi

559
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,120
You?

560
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,200
Sir, I am a mechanic

561
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,800
- Remember the addresses you delivered in?
- Yes, sir

562
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,280
If you just sing the same old "We just know
Maari and nothing else", no one is leaving here

563
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,600
You better speak up if
there is anything else

564
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,320
Sir, I was asked to visit the
police station for some inquiry

565
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,560
There was heavy traffic.
Also, I live at Neelangarai

566
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,240
You too belonged to Maari's group?

567
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,960
- Professor lived at Neelangarai, right?
- That bald fellow?

568
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,040
- Come here
- Sir...

569
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,360
Do you know college
professor, Meghna's house?

570
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,840
No, sir. I don't know whose address it is

571
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,600
Usually I'm asked to deliver the
parcel or some days to collect

572
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,360
I was paid well. That's all, sir

573
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,200
I befriended Maari at that
auto rickshaw stand over there

574
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:29,840
Sir I delivered in Palavakkam, Kottivakkam,
Neelangarai, Kovalam, Thiruvanmiyur etc.

575
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,560
Remember all those addresses?

576
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,840
I do, sir

577
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,920
- Sivaraman
- Sir...

578
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,640
Tail all the houses
they have delivered in

579
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,520
- I need all their updates within an hour
- Okay, sir

580
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,560
Saba...

581
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,160
- College all the CCTV footage of those
houses and hand it to Selvam - Okay, sir

582
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,520
Do you know him?

583
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,680
Tell me, Sivaraman

584
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,840
Sir, all those addresses point from
minister's farm house to Police IG's house

585
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,080
Sir, all the address are of powerful people

586
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,000
Most of them are politicians

587
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,800
Rest of them are government officers

588
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,760
Since all of these people
are very powerful...

589
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,000
CCTV are available

590
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,240
Out of all the houses delivered, the least
ranked is an assistant of executive magistrate

591
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,560
We inquired him but he
didn't have any answers

592
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,280
I shall bring him sir

593
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,440
Okay. Bring him.
I'll take care of it

594
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,320
Sir...

595
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,960
just a moment

596
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,160
Sir, this was Sampath's location,
an hour before he died

597
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,040
Based on that location, he was at the
professor's house to deliver something

598
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,840
But we don't have the CCTV footage from
that day to find out what happened

599
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Sir, look...

600
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,320
someone has been following
all those delivery boys

601
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,680
He finds out if the package was delivered
successfully and is updating someone

602
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,680
I somehow feel that even Maari wasn't
aware that this guy was following them

603
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,080
Selvam, check if you find
a clear image of this guy

604
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,080
Forward his photo to all the local stations

605
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,520
We must nab him by tonight

606
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,200
I'll take care if any problem arises

607
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,560
Tell me, Aarmugam. Where
was the package from?

608
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,480
How much did you pay?

609
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,960
2 months ago.
One fine evening around 5...

610
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,840
I received a package

611
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,440
The package contained...

612
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,840
I had once made a deal and
got a bribe of 0.5 millions

613
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:22,720
The package had a pen drive containing
audio and video of the deal I had made

614
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,400
Right away I received a
call from an unknown number

615
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,040
When I attended it, I understood it
was them, who sent me the package

616
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,560
I told them I'd give them all of
the 0.5 million bribe I received

617
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,520
But they refused money

618
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,640
Instead they wanted a list of my
higher officials who earned more bribe

619
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,800
After that I monitored
and gave them the list

620
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,440
Fine, you may leave

621
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,360
Sir, it was a video of my boyfriend and I

622
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,120
I don't know how they got their hands on it

623
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,400
They started blackmailing
me with that video

624
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:00,200
I broke up with my boyfriend
but even after that...

625
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,560
they blackmailed me and made
me attended many parties

626
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,720
With some guys in party...I
was forced to...

627
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,720
Most of them were sons of big shots

628
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,680
Few of them were the
sons of some ministers

629
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:21,840
They let go of me but now they are torturing
those guys who spent time with me

630
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,320
They call me every now and then

631
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,120
I had did it only once
with my boyfriend...

632
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,640
but these guys made me...

633
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,160
We split the moment I got that package

634
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,640
It's been long since I got
a call from them

635
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,000
My life just got back on
track and is going smooth

636
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,440
Please, it won't be good if I
get involved in a case now

637
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,840
I paid them the ransom
they demanded

638
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,440
Please let me go

639
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,680
Minister sent me. It was his son

640
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,200
Please don't drag him into this case
now when the MP elections are around

641
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,680
Minister trying to win a seat for his son in
election. He'll be a central minister soon

642
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,880
That group was troubling him
and we have settled them

643
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,480
Tell us what we can do for you
and I'll ensure it's done

644
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,840
Tell me, Chezian

645
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,040
Do you see any loop hole
in their statement?

646
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,120
It could be one mysterious guy
or two or could be a gang

647
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:22,000
Every low ranked to senior most government
employees, business tycoons, VIPs, politicians...

648
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,760
all their illegal transactions, bribes
they collect and their affairs...

649
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,000
They collect all these details, place
cameras in their bedrooms and record them

650
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,080
Then they blackmail them for ransom

651
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,520
They are executing a crime
in a perfect way

652
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,680
When businessmen meet at big
hotels to make big deals...

653
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:42,720
using latest technology, for example
in boltnuts, bottles or sunglasses...

654
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,040
small cameras are installed
and videos are recorded

655
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,760
Tried to check if these culprits can be caught
in CCTV but they hack it and destroy it

656
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:56,720
The details up to the last PA of a minister,
his multiple phone numbers, his call logs...

657
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,440
They got every single details

658
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,480
One of their such victim was the
college professor Meghna Sundarajan

659
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,000
They blackmailed here with the audio of her
calls with her students and demanded ransom

660
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,840
She committed suicide realizing
it would be shameful if it leaks

661
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,400
Moreover, it wasn't those thieves who
committed that murder in Thiruvanmiyur

662
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,680
These guys did it

663
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,080
Sampath, who got murdered, was
one among these delivery boys

664
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:21,840
These delivery boys blindly deliver the
package without knowing any of it's details

665
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,840
They take the money and deliver the
package to the mentioned address

666
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,520
Knowing the risk if these details leak, they
murdered Sampath just like they murdered Maari

667
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,440
So, what do you
suggest we do now?

668
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,840
We are not sure how many lives
are lost because of these guys

669
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,240
So the only option is to nab them, get their
statement and finish them off in an Encounter

670
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,280
Then we will do it

671
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,600
We'll proceed, sir

672
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,400
Hello...

673
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,200
- Raadhi...
- What happened?

674
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,040
The CCTV footage at professor's house is missing
from since Sampath went their to deliver

675
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,320
Neither that professor nor
Sampath are alive now

676
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,720
Now, I doubt if it was really
Sampath's employer who killed him

677
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,080
Let's do it the same way

678
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,720
Police targeted the thieves,
we found these frauds

679
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,480
Now, the police is targetting these frauds

680
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,280
I'm sure there is someone
else above them!

681
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,280
In order to find Sampath's
murderer ...
