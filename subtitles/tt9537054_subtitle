1
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,050
Uncle,

2
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:03,528
did you get the report?

3
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,387
Yes.

4
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,801
How do I understand
what is the matter?

5
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,653
Tell me what is written
in the report.

6
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,293
The reports are not good, Lau.

7
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,848
It's not good?

8
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:15,192
How bad is it?

9
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:17,786
How can I explain it
in the middle of the road?

10
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:19,825
Is it life threatening?

11
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,285
Yes, it is.

12
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:24,707
Lau,

13
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:27,614
if we can’t provide him with
good medical treatment immediately,

14
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:29,856
we will not be able to save him.

15
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:32,270
Did the doctor say anything?

16
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,684
His heart isn't
functioning properly.

17
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,098
Treatment? Is there no treatment?

18
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:41,269
The treatment will be
very expensive.

19
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,832
No problem.
Whatever the cost,

20
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:45,512
we will bear it. We will sell
all the property if needed.

21
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,793
You start the treatment.

22
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:48,387
Lau,

23
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,434
you take him to India.

24
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,543
Or we will not be able to save him.

25
00:02:58,473 --> 00:03:00,461
Uncle, is there any
alternate way?

26
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:06,269
Don’t cry, Lau.
Come, let us go. Come.

27
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:13,278
Let's see what he has to say.

28
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:17,997
Raise your concerns one at a time,

29
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,630
as soon as he comes.

30
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:22,748
Do not pounce on him
the moment he arrives.

31
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:24,139
Monsu will be the first one.

32
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:25,332
Yes.

33
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:26,870
What I can make out
from what you said is,

34
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,127
that you have to take
your mom to the hospital.

35
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:32,512
Her condition is not that good
and she is not strong enough.

36
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,895
A recommendation from Mr Ganesh…

37
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:36,059
Sir?

38
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:39,645
Recommendation means a letter.

39
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:42,278
She'll be admitted in the hospital
as soon as you show it.

40
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,887
What if something goes wrong?

41
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:47,153
You please have a word
with Mr Ganesh.

42
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:48,332
Hear me out.

43
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:50,950
He himself is not keeping well.

44
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:52,574
Don’t pressurise him.

45
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:55,317
When he arrives, request him.

46
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:57,731
He is a very kind hearted person,
he'll definitely arrange something.

47
00:03:57,926 --> 00:03:59,090
What is wrong with Mr Ganesh?

48
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,184
What will you do knowing it?
Nonsense!

49
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,090
Why are you scolding him, Bhavani?

50
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,864
He just asked a simple question.

51
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,386
Nothing much, dear.

52
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,098
Like an old vehicle,
I've grown old too.

53
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:12,004
I cannot start it.

54
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:14,572
When I honk, the horn doesn't work.

55
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:16,978
When I want it to go left,
it goes right.

56
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:19,525
And it goes to the left
when I want it the other way.

57
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:20,461
That’s it.

58
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,341
Why are you standing?
Sit down, Bhavani. - Yes.

59
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:25,770
Let me know what is your problem.

60
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,090
Tell him.
- Yes, tell me.

61
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,200
My mother is suffering
for the last two months. - Okay.

62
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,563
I haave taken her to
many doctors, but no use.

63
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:37,379
If you can please recommend
her to the District hospital.

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,594
Yes, I will definitely
recommend. Well...

65
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:41,940
Did you consult uncle Liakar?
- No.

66
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,116
I heard that

67
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:44,031
he is deaf.

68
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,740
Do you want to treat your mom
or sing a song for him?

69
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:51,328
Don’t act like a fool.

70
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:54,501
The fool will first step on waste,
so his foot his smeared by it.

71
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:57,487
Next he checks it with his fingers
to know what he stepped on.

72
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:00,020
His finger gets dirty too.

73
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:03,526
His doubt is still not cleared
and so, he smells it.

74
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,465
It smears his nose as well,
dirtying three body parts.

75
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,574
Finally when he is convinced
that it was poop,

76
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,176
he pats on his head smearing
there thus dirtying four parts.

77
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,793
There's nothing to
laugh about. Quiet.

78
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:15,230
Listen, understand the meaning
of this joke.

79
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,004
Uncle Liakar may talk nonsense,

80
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:21,175
but the treatment that he gives
is final. Do you understand?

81
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:22,785
So, consult him first.

82
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,964
Do you see that?

83
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,855
Think of the devil
and the devil is here.

84
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,175
What are you doing?

85
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:30,113
He will hear you.
- How will he? He is deaf.

86
00:05:30,254 --> 00:05:32,551
No sir, I can hear everything.

87
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,114
My son has bought me
this hearing aid from Dhaka.

88
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:39,645
Now I can clearly hear everything.

89
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:41,019
Go.

90
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:42,558
Yes. Let us go.

91
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,159
Go inside.
- Let's go.

92
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,176
Careful.

93
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:48,730
Please come.

94
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:51,520
Okay. So who is next, Bhavani?

95
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:54,484
One, two, three.
- Montu...

96
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:55,813
Where is your mother?

97
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:57,321
This way. Here.

98
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,835
Montu?

99
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,848
Here.
- Where's your mom?

100
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,600
She is there.

101
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,512
Madam, please listen.

102
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,699
Uncle Liakar has Ganesh's report.

103
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:14,496
The report is not very encouraging.

104
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,926
He wants to discuss this with you.

105
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:20,543
He is waiting in the living room.

106
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:21,972
What does the report say?

107
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:23,813
Please come.

108
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:46,512
This isn't the time to
think about money.

109
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:50,098
Don't worry about the expenses.

110
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:54,246
What is the use of this wealth
if we can’t use it to save his life?

111
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:59,043
Uncle, which hospital
in Kolkata do you suggest?

112
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,293
MRI hospital will be the best.

113
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,856
I have many contacts in Kolkata.

114
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,465
So, you need not worry.

115
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:08,545
I will have the hotel
and the car booked.

116
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,459
There will be no inconvenience.

117
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:11,800
But dear,

118
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:13,707
please make it fast.

119
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:15,269
Don’t delay anymore.

120
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,442
What are you thinking?

121
00:07:21,926 --> 00:07:23,770
I was wondering about my fate.

122
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,629
I couldn’t settle in life, uncle.

123
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:34,301
He has been just running around.

124
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:40,373
Does he know about it?

125
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:42,629
No, we haven't told him yet.

126
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:44,402
Okay.

127
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:46,824
There's no need to inform him.

128
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:49,887
I will inform him.

129
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:53,731
Uncle, please have some
refreshments before you leave.

130
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,317
I find it difficult to fall
asleep on this huge bed.

131
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:05,262
I feel like talking to someone.

132
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,751
Does it feel good,

133
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:09,899
to lie on the bed
and gaze at the ceiling?

134
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:12,696
You give all types of treatment.

135
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,384
So, I will have to come to you
for check-up once in a while.

136
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:17,071
In between your conversations,

137
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,892
if you could talk to brother
about me, it would be good.

138
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,915
When do you want to leave?

139
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:37,766
Today.

140
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,540
Don’t worry,

141
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:42,212
I am here for you.

142
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:48,104
No, no...

143
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:49,634
What happened?

144
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:52,665
I will be back.
- Where are you going?

145
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,157
Where are you going?

146
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,149
Lau!

147
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,235
Lau.

148
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:04,508
Listen to me.

149
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:05,641
Yes?

150
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:07,938
What happened?
- I wonder where he left.

151
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,196
Did you inform him?

152
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:11,555
Yes.

153
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:13,797
Let me check on him.

154
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:26,690
Where are you going?

155
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,776
I will be back in some time.
- Come, let us go inside.

156
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:31,854
No, I will go alone.
- You aren't in good health...

157
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:41,378
Stop, Mr Ganesh.

158
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:44,104
Wait. Please wait.

159
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:46,350
What happened?

160
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:47,994
Come, let's go.

161
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:51,260
No matter what you do,
I will not survive, Lau.

162
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,495
No one knows this better than you.

163
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:15,721
Uncle Liakar.

164
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,745
Uncle Liakar.

165
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:23,424
Uncle...
- Hey...

166
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,440
You are here! Why are you
standing outside?

167
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,714
Come, let us sit inside.

168
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,237
You wear that instrument, first.

169
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:30,510
What did you say?

170
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:32,299
First, wear your hearing aid.

171
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:34,611
Yes. I keep forgetting it.

172
00:10:35,776 --> 00:10:37,236
Yes, tell me now.

173
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:38,471
In Kanestipur,

174
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,596
everyone knows
you're an expert doctor.

175
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,854
Your advice is very important for me.

176
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,081
Look...

177
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:47,556
Padma has told me everything.

178
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,940
But she is very naive
and innocent.

179
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:53,158
She is not able to
convey everything.

180
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,166
She is crying continuously.

181
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,361
So if you can please explain me
the technical facts,

182
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,542
how serious

183
00:10:57,768 --> 00:11:00,526
is my condition.
How threatening is it?

184
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:02,620
Then it will be convenient
for me to understand.

185
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:04,330
Son...

186
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,776
You need to get yourself
treated in India.

187
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:08,690
The condition of your heart
is not good.

188
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:11,690
If we take a step immediately,
maybe we have some chances.

189
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:12,878
What are the chances?

190
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,964
You are not in good shape.

191
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,284
Your heart condition is very bad,

192
00:11:17,486 --> 00:11:18,573
you are in great danger.

193
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
Old man,

194
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:21,268
what are you saying?

195
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,510
Won’t I survive?

196
00:11:22,612 --> 00:11:25,214
Oh God! Isn't that why,
I am sending you to India?

197
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,479
Don’t worry, don’t worry.
- Uncle,

198
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,417
won’t I survive?

199
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,809
Are you stressed out?

200
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:13,857
Who allowed you to interview me?

201
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:16,318
Don't you see I'm calm?

202
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,935
You talk nonsense always.

203
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:22,083
I just want to say that you
shouldn’t suppress your emotions.

204
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,185
Talk to me, you will feel better.

205
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:27,904
You weren't needed here in India.

206
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,208
Now that you are here, keep mum.

207
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:32,755
You are chewing my brain.

208
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:36,323
You see that I am already worked up
and you trouble me more.

209
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,896
You are happy deep within.

210
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,513
That Ganesh is breathing his last.

211
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:41,786
You better keep quiet.

212
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,348
Tell me what is she doing.

213
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:45,654
The doctor has called her in.

214
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:47,154
He needs to treat me,

215
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:48,573
it’s already past 20 mins.

216
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,276
Do I check?
- Yes.

217
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,856
Wait.

218
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:54,403
There's no need. Let us wait here.

219
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,427
Come, let us sit.
- Come.

220
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,794
You are late.

221
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:01,043
I can't assure you much.

222
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,668
But we will try to
reduce his sufferings.

223
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:06,716
Leave the rest to God.

224
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:10,958
Is this the first time
you've come to Kokata?

225
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:13,559
Yes.

226
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:16,987
Where are you put up?

227
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:18,505
Do you have any relatives here?

228
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:20,185
Yes, we have.

229
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,384
Is it not required to admit him
in the hospital?

230
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,122
If admitted, the expenses
will be too high.

231
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,786
Let him commute daily,
till he is comfortable.

232
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:34,638
Ensure he is happy.

233
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:38,931
We'll ensure to reduce the physical
pain with the help of medicines.

234
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,220
It will be your responsibility
to keep him happy.

235
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,513
Buy these medicines and injections.

236
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:47,372
Visit me again
when you get the reports.

237
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:50,455
Only then can we discuss about
the surgery that's needed.

238
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:53,950
Will he be cured after the surgery?

239
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,490
We'll definitely try our best.

240
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,638
Even if there is only 1% chance.

241
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:01,911
Have it.

242
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,513
Thanks.
- It’s piping hot.

243
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:07,326
Please be seated.
- Come, sit here.

244
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,949
Zakir, thanks for everything.
- I can't thank him enough, Lau.

245
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,267
Please don’t embarrass me.

246
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:15,494
You're quite close to uncle Liakar.
So, this is my duty.

247
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,201
Sister in law is in the doctor's
chamber since a long time.

248
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:20,630
Will you please check once?

249
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:23,028
She isn't in his cabin. I met her.
She has gone to buy medicines.

250
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,517
Where is the chemist?

251
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,289
Don’t worry, it's nearby.

252
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:29,267
Please have your tea,
it will turn cold due to AC.

253
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:38,486
Please give these.

254
00:17:31,962 --> 00:17:33,027
Bill these.

255
00:17:36,684 --> 00:17:37,691
Whose is this?

256
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:40,626
Ganesh Mondal?

257
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,931
Okay,

258
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:49,134
when will we get the report?

259
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:53,195
Tomorrow.

260
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:54,579
Okay.

261
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:01,547
What are you thinking about?

262
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:05,188
Why don’t you tell me,

263
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:08,000
what did the doctor tell you?
- What could he say?

264
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:10,391
He can’t say anything
without seeing the report.

265
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:14,376
Once he gets the reports he'll be
in a better position to guide us.

266
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:16,578
Okay.

267
00:20:17,477 --> 00:20:19,672
I will have to take a bath
once we reach our room.

268
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,703
Listen...

269
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:24,887
No idea what jelly like substance
or glue they used to stick

270
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,676
those rubber instruments
all over my body for the tests.

271
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:32,927
They shaved my chest hair too.

272
00:20:33,676 --> 00:20:34,692
You're laughing!

273
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:38,200
Can’t see myself in the mirror,
I am looking funny. - Hush.

274
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,129
Speak softly.

275
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:43,840
Zakir.
- Yes, sir?

276
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,450
What is your full name?

277
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:47,291
Zakir Hussein.

278
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,526
Okay.

279
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:49,785
And where do you reside?

280
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,708
Nearby at Amnasagar.

281
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:53,848
The Tipu Sultan mosque.

282
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:55,809
Just behind it.

283
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,409
Who is Tipu Sultan?

284
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,479
Why, do you want to
make friends with him?

285
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:00,754
No, I just asked.

286
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:03,410
Really surprising!
- I too don’t know about him.

287
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,050
This is your first time at Kolkata?

288
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:07,526
Yes.

289
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:09,809
Zakir.
- Yes?

290
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:13,529
How far is the Victoria memorial
and Howrah bridge from here?

291
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,020
It isn't too far.

292
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,293
It would hardly take
around 40 mins.

293
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:18,481
It's near.

294
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,301
Will you take us
around these places?

295
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:23,192
I have heard a lot about
these places since childhood.

296
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:24,656
I wish to see these places.

297
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,583
Sure. Let us get you cured first.

298
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:31,817
Sir, you don’t have any medical
insurance policy, right?

299
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,223
No.

300
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:35,285
God!

301
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,747
These days, the medical
expenses are very high.

302
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,110
So I have taken a mediclaim
for all my family members.

303
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,203
We can claim even up to
hundred thousand rupees.

304
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,801
'After immersing'

305
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:08,489
'everything in water,'

306
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,168
'still there are some remains.'

307
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:14,926
'Don’t see.'

308
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:16,551
'Don’t see.'

309
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,554
Nasir, Nasir.

310
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,670
Here are Ganesh Mondal's details.
A phone number is also there.

311
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,106
Thank you.

312
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:38,223
Hello.
- I'm calling from the hospital.

313
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,848
Who is speaking. - Have fruits.
- You purchased medicines from here.

314
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:45,145
Yes, tell me.

315
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,169
Hello, please talk to this fellow.

316
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,411
Yes, hold on.
- Here, speak to him.

317
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:54,324
Keep these.

318
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,497
Say hello.
- Hello.

319
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:58,883
You bought medicines
this morning.

320
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:00,145
There was a mistake.

321
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,113
You'll get Rs 200 more as refund.

322
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:05,527
When will you be coming
tomorrow morning?

323
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,497
Around 10 AM tomorrow.

324
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:14,051
Please meet me once, Padma.

325
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:21,192
Okay.

326
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:22,895
This is Kolkata.

327
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,184
This is India.

328
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:28,584
Don’t agree on everything here.
You'll be caught.

329
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,415
Okay, bye.

330
00:23:37,254 --> 00:23:38,254
Who was it?

331
00:23:38,465 --> 00:23:41,318
The call was from
the chemist at the hospital.

332
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:43,154
I had bought medicines from there.

333
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,481
By mistake, he refunded us

334
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,278
Rs 200 less. And so,

335
00:23:48,457 --> 00:23:50,093
he has asked to
collect it tomorrow.

336
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,669
He is a good man
to refund the amount.

337
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,067
You wouldn’t have known.

338
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,903
You should calculate
such account properly.

339
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:58,106
Excuse me.
Why didn’t you go then?

340
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,044
How dare you blame her!
Don’t cross your limits.

341
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,215
I was thinking about you.
- No, no, no, Lau.

342
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:04,325
She was running
all over the hospital

343
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,590
and you are blaming her?

344
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,698
No, no.
You are misunderstanding me.

345
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:09,635
He is right, it was my mistake.

346
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:12,839
No, Padma.
He is talking nonsense.

347
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,535
Be it 200 or 2000,
it’s me who lose.

348
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:17,637
Why is he concerned?
- Please hold this.

349
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:20,645
You are unnecessarily
blowing it out of proportion.

350
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:22,192
No. Don’t utter a word more!

351
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:24,360
Just go to your room.
Sitting here doing nothing.

352
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,068
Why did you accompany us to India?

353
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,364
Just to feed me medicines?

354
00:24:27,536 --> 00:24:29,380
Why are you shouting?
You will fall ill.

355
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:31,098
No. Who is he to teach you?
- Calm down.

356
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:32,637
How dare he!

357
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:34,995
Don’t you dare say anything.

358
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,063
How dare he!

359
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:41,237
Is Mr Ganesh aware that you met me?

360
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:45,356
No, I haven't informed him yet.

361
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:53,715
Let me know if you need anything.

362
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:55,295
I'm here.

363
00:24:56,723 --> 00:24:58,989
Dr Sen is a great heart surgeon.

364
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,044
He is a good man.

365
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:07,239
Let me know about
the medicines required.

366
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:09,410
I will provide them.

367
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,473
I can avail the staff discount.

368
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,067
Okay.

369
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:19,354
As advised by you,

370
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:23,613
I have stopped all illegal
activities like robbery that I did

371
00:25:24,614 --> 00:25:31,520
back at Bosirhaat.
I have started working here.

372
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:34,919
That's good.

373
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,551
Where are you staying?

374
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,607
We are staying at a hotel,

375
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:47,740
Swarnmala.

376
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:49,667
Where is that?

377
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:52,441
Rashbihari.
- Yes, Rashbihari.

378
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:01,442
Will you meet him
once after his check up?

379
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:08,418
Yes, I'll meet him.

380
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,283
But who would meet him?

381
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:18,372
Nasir Ali or Subhash?

382
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:21,075
Nasir Ali.

383
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,285
You look like the headmasters
shown in old movies.

384
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,567
You look exactly like
Sejukta Moni Mohan Bandopadhyay.

385
00:26:30,684 --> 00:26:31,960
Such a nice actor.

386
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:35,733
Looking at you, I recall
all my childhood memories.

387
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:37,301
Have a seat.

388
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:38,965
Sit.
- Come.

389
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:43,442
As per the reports,

390
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,337
the condition
of his heart is not good.

391
00:26:47,692 --> 00:26:48,783
Sugar,

392
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,375
kidney, pressure,

393
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,306
none of these are normal.

394
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:55,405
Specially,
the condition of the valve...

395
00:26:55,525 --> 00:26:56,883
Doctor, just a minute.

396
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,073
What is this valve?

397
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:01,757
Sir, we're from the countryside.

398
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,747
We do not understand
these terms very well.

399
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,787
Can you simplify it?

400
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,223
Blood flows to and from the heart,

401
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:12,223
with the help of two doors.

402
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,605
Both these doors
are not functioning well.

403
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,496
Apart from that, there are blockages
which are obstructing blood flow.

404
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:21,685
Surgery is the only option.
Medicines alone won’t help.

405
00:27:22,012 --> 00:27:25,520
The sooner the operation
is done, the better.

406
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:27,014
Doctor,

407
00:27:27,134 --> 00:27:28,973
what would be the expense?

408
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:32,278
It should be
around 400,000 rupees.

409
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:37,863
Can the cost be reduced?

410
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,872
Money is not a problem.

411
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,256
Yes. Money is not an issue.

412
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:44,252
Not having that amount is.

413
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:50,356
I am just kidding,
please don’t mind.

414
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:54,434
Doctor,

415
00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:55,903
when do we get him admitted?

416
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:57,794
As soon as possible.
- Tomorrow?

417
00:27:58,098 --> 00:27:59,137
Yes, sure.

418
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:00,676
Get him as soon as
you can arrange the amount.

419
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:03,519
We will arrange for the money,
in the meanwhile have him admitted

420
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:05,426
so that the treatment
is not stopped.

421
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:07,198
No, that is not possible.

422
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:09,056
There are rules to be followed.

423
00:28:09,176 --> 00:28:11,333
You have to pay an advance,
have him admitted.

424
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:12,942
These are the rules.

425
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,457
I can’t help you with this.

426
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,575
You can’t help?
How can you say that, doctor?

427
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,465
Just for some money,
will the treatment stop?

428
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:22,348
You are aware that
the patient is in pain.

429
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:25,387
At such a crucial time,
the treatment will stop?

430
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:28,241
Wait. Give me 2 - 3 days,

431
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:31,294
we will arrange for the money.
Just a few days.

432
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,700
Padma, can you wait
outside for some time? - Why?

433
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:37,036
Why do you ask?
When I said go, just go.

434
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:39,988
Come.

435
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:43,145
Just a minute.
- That’s fine.

436
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:47,301
Doctor,

437
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:48,715
I have had a long fulfilling life.

438
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:51,707
I have fulfilled all my wishes,

439
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:54,368
so please don’t hide
anything from me.

440
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:56,833
I am aware that

441
00:28:57,012 --> 00:29:00,567
the condition
of my heart is not good.

442
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:02,231
It’s me who will die.

443
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,895
So I have complete rights
to know the truth.

444
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:11,038
Will spending the ransom
benefit me or the hospital?

445
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:12,408
Please tell me frankly.

446
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:14,681
I have never

447
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,672
lied in my life.

448
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:20,468
You please
don't deprive me of the truth.

449
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:23,567
Surgery is our only hope.

450
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:25,473
If there is 1% chances of survival,

451
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:28,716
it is possible only through
surgery, otherwise... - Otherwise?

452
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,259
I won’t survive, right?

453
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,551
Anyone who is alive
will die some day.

454
00:29:34,997 --> 00:29:36,333
That is the bitter truth.

455
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,208
One can't live forever.

456
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,723
Mr Ganesh, it would be
a great achievement

457
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:46,129
for our medical team
if we can save you.

458
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,228
This 1% chance is
our fight with life.

459
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:50,551
Don’t think about money.

460
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,387
Your life is more important

461
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:54,067
for your family.

462
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,215
That is where the problem is.

463
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:58,520
I used to wear just white clothes.

464
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:02,410
After marriage, I started
wearing colourful clothes.

465
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:05,701
I would not have
thought about the surgery,

466
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,150
if I were a bachelor.

467
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,762
Now I will have to take whatever

468
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,908
1% or 2% chance
I have for my family.

469
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:12,318
I will take the chance.

470
00:30:13,215 --> 00:30:14,762
I will be back with the money.

471
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:17,911
Sir,

472
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,007
if the 1% does not work,

473
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,292
if the surgery is not successful,

474
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,100
then how many days will I live?

475
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:27,913
Go back home.

476
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:34,193
It will take 0.4 to
0.5 million rupees.

477
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,151
It is a heart surgery.

478
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:40,768
Whatever they may tell, you'll
see 'conditions apply' written.

479
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,223
As per pre-listed conditions.

480
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,426
Yes mom.

481
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,200
I need to take this call.
- Sure.

482
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:56,887
He is here.

483
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:01,223
What did you discuss?

484
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:05,106
I told him to give us some time.

485
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:07,347
We will arrange for
the money and be back.

486
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:09,763
Let's go back to the hotel,
we have lots to do.

487
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:11,176
Come.

488
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,292
Why do you both look so sad?

489
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:16,608
If you will give up,

490
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,872
from where do I get
the strength to fight this battle?

491
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:20,972
Let us go.

492
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:23,481
Ask Zakir to bring
the taxi by the gate.

493
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:26,225
Okay. Bring him carefully.
- Yes, I will get him.

494
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:27,551
Come
- Let's go.

495
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:30,965
Listen.

496
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,549
I have won the most
important war of my life,

497
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:35,770
by marrying you.

498
00:31:35,973 --> 00:31:38,286
I do not fear death.

499
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:40,466
What happened?

500
00:31:42,145 --> 00:31:43,293
What happened?
Are you fine?

501
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:47,348
The doors in my heart
are misbehaving

502
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,997
as I am talking to you.

503
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:52,333
Do not worry.
- Stop.

504
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,965
I am fine.

505
00:31:56,106 --> 00:31:57,122
Come.

506
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:59,418
Let us arrange the money.
- Mr Ganesh...

507
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:12,044
I work here.

508
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:15,419
Good.

509
00:32:17,474 --> 00:32:19,252
When I saw her a few minutes back...

510
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:22,411
I was surprised to see Padma here.

511
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:23,770
That's obvious.

512
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:26,791
Even though I see her daily,
she amazes me.

513
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,107
You are seeing her after
da uration of 5 to 6 years Subhash.

514
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:35,231
I had informed you
all about Nasir Ali.

515
00:32:36,177 --> 00:32:37,560
You know everything.

516
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,613
No. Knowing everything
is not a big deal.

517
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:44,833
You don’t have to try hard
and act as Subhash.

518
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:46,723
Relax.

519
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:50,974
Nasir,

520
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,650
I had served you day and night when
you broke your legs at Bangladesh.

521
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:56,513
Didn’t I?

522
00:32:57,747 --> 00:32:59,597
Now it is India’s turn
to return the favour.

523
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:04,100
The heart of mine
is not in a good condition,

524
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:07,216
so I will need your help.

525
00:33:08,552 --> 00:33:09,856
Do not worry.

526
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:11,802
I am here.

527
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:13,756
Whenever you need anything,

528
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:15,333
let me know.

529
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,848
I will try my best.

530
00:33:19,192 --> 00:33:20,447
Just needed your assurance.

531
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,848
I am very happy.

532
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:24,708
See you soon. Bye.

533
00:33:25,606 --> 00:33:27,231
Let us move, Lau.
- Yes, let us go.

534
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:29,833
What did the doctor say?

535
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,677
He said to have him
admitted as soon as possible.

536
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:34,505
So, you cannot delay at all.

537
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:35,739
He is a well-known doctor.

538
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:37,606
It takes 3 to 4 months
to get his appointment.

539
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,262
If he has advised...

540
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:41,301
Mr Ganesh,

541
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,310
the doctor has asked
to get admitted immediately.

542
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:45,138
So when are you getting admitted?

543
00:33:45,286 --> 00:33:47,997
We need to arrange
some money first. - How much?

544
00:33:48,974 --> 00:33:51,418
At the time of admission,
we will have to pay around 50,000.

545
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:54,114
Then the complete treatment
will cost around

546
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,499
400,000 to 500,000.
- Okay.

547
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:58,317
Why are you sounding low?

548
00:33:58,724 --> 00:34:00,435
It isn't Lau who is being treated.

549
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,129
Ganesh Mondal is being treated.

550
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:05,504
Therefore, it has to cost
a minimum 500,000 rupees.

551
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,903
Don’t you dare take
this as an insult!

552
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,231
I am just kidding.

553
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:11,426
Let us go.

554
00:34:12,028 --> 00:34:14,794
I am sure we will meet frequently.

555
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:16,051
Sir, the car is here.

556
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:17,435
Let's go.

557
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,036
Walk carefully.
- Bye.

558
00:34:19,645 --> 00:34:21,411
Mr Ganesh, just a minute.

559
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,263
Keep this money.

560
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:25,802
Here.
- What for?

561
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:30,270
I told him about 0.4 to 0.5 million
and he is giving Rs 200!

562
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:34,387
It’s the amount I paid extra while
purchasing medicines yesterday.

563
00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:36,044
Yes, it was my mistake
in calculating the amount.

564
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,388
The call that
you received yesterday?

565
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:39,341
Yes.

566
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,138
Okay, I got it.
Yes. Thank you.

567
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:48,997
You are not concentrating.

568
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,466
If you continue like this,
you won’t be able to pass.

569
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:53,481
Try to recall, try.

570
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:56,317
Twinkle twinkle little star,

571
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:59,091
how I wonder what you are?
- Don’t move. Don’t move.

572
00:34:59,536 --> 00:35:00,606
Sit straight.

573
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:02,630
Yes.
Recite.

574
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,060
Twinkle twinkle little star...

575
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,231
What happened to dad, Bhavani?

576
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,872
Human body is
always prone to ailments.

577
00:35:11,255 --> 00:35:12,488
He is old now.

578
00:35:12,732 --> 00:35:14,339
He has gone to India
for better treatment.

579
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:15,765
He will come back fit and fine.

580
00:35:15,885 --> 00:35:17,630
Is he suffering like Lokkhi?

581
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,192
Lokkhi was suffering
from mental illness.

582
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:22,435
Your dad is suffering
from heart disease.

583
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,552
Don’t talk, learn your lessons.

584
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:28,200
Will my dad too die like Lokkhi?

585
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,497
Nothing will happen to your father.

586
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,614
He is a good human being,

587
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:33,950
a very kindhearted man.

588
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,302
God will definitely
take care of him.

589
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:38,388
Now concentrate on your lesson.

590
00:35:43,636 --> 00:35:44,659
Hello.

591
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,114
We will need to arrange
400,000 million rupees.

592
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,075
I am sending Lau tomorrow.

593
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,020
He will come and make
all the arrangements.

594
00:35:51,677 --> 00:35:54,349
You just need to inform
Shakeel sir from BJP.

595
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,708
Lau will cross
the border from Naopara.

596
00:35:58,044 --> 00:35:59,692
Ensure that he is present.

597
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,075
Explain him everything. He is a
good man, will definitely help us.

598
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,363
How are you?

599
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,013
Have you ever seen Ganesh Mondal
in a bad state, Bhavani?

600
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:11,747
Well, how is Montu?

601
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,958
Montu is right here with me,
studying.

602
00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:16,325
Talk to him.
- Montu, it's your dad.

603
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:18,356
Talk to him.
- Hello, dad.

604
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:20,020
Yes Montu, tell me.

605
00:36:20,153 --> 00:36:21,067
How are you?

606
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,927
I am good.
- Did you see Kolkata around?

607
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:27,286
Yes. - Will you take me
there when I grow up?

608
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:29,599
Yes, I will.

609
00:36:30,028 --> 00:36:31,169
Once you grow up,
I will take you around.

610
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,294
Here, talk to your mom.

611
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:37,372
Montu...

612
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:40,427
How are you, dear?
- Yes.

613
00:36:41,114 --> 00:36:42,185
What are you doing?

614
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:43,700
Here...

615
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:45,911
I'm talking to you, dear.

616
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:47,552
When will you be back?

617
00:36:48,427 --> 00:36:50,809
We will be back soon dear,
very soon.

618
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,684
Be a good boy. Okay?

619
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:56,099
Listen to elders.
- Pass me.

620
00:36:56,544 --> 00:36:59,356
Wait, talk to dad.

621
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:03,325
Montu...

622
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:04,997
Listen, son.

623
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:06,528
Do you want to come to Kolkata?

624
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:08,052
Yes, I want to.

625
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:11,192
Then pass the phone to Bhavani.
- What are you doing?

626
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:12,919
Dad wants to talk to you.

627
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:15,817
Yes, tell me.

628
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:18,646
Bhavani, Lau is arriving tomorrow.

629
00:37:18,982 --> 00:37:20,583
Send Montu to India with him.

630
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,951
Have his bags packed,
rest I will take care.

631
00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:26,044
Okay.
- Okay, bye.

632
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:28,755
What are you doing?

633
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:30,951
It is not yet holidays at school.

634
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:34,263
What if I have to leave the world?
What will you do then?

635
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:36,942
Move.

636
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:38,496
No leaves!

637
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:53,349
Why are you crying, Lau?

638
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:55,482
All humans are

639
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,771
bound to die one day.

640
00:37:58,138 --> 00:38:00,052
Did you see the crowd
at the hospital?

641
00:38:00,513 --> 00:38:02,490
So many people are suffering.

642
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:05,028
If you are fit today,

643
00:38:05,177 --> 00:38:08,169
it is all by the grace of God.
Do you understand?

644
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:10,138
Do not cry.

645
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:14,973
Hold this.

646
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:16,270
Write down

647
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:17,872
whatever I am dictating.

648
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,724
When you return,

649
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:23,302
bring Montu along
with complete security.

650
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,567
Why?

651
00:38:24,857 --> 00:38:26,919
What do you mean by that?
You will get him as it’s my order.

652
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:30,935
When you leave,

653
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:34,341
carry the keys
to my locker as well.

654
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:36,826
Whatever ornaments
are there in the locker,

655
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:39,732
mortgage them all
at Shankar sir’s shop.

656
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,990
No, no, no.
Don’t do this.

657
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,013
No need to mortgage ornaments.

658
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:46,333
There are many,
who will lend me money.

659
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,013
As Ganesh Mondal’s wife,
I can’t beg for money.

660
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,114
Once you are cured,

661
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:53,927
we can repay
and get the jewelry back.

662
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,458
No, I won’t accept this.
- May I come in?

663
00:38:57,966 --> 00:38:59,747
Mr Ganesh, there is a gentleman

664
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:00,927
who wants to see you.

665
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:03,482
Okay. Sit, I will be back soon.

666
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:05,348
I'll be back.
- Come.

667
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:08,818
Please wait.

668
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:13,442
Come closer.

669
00:39:15,107 --> 00:39:16,896
Ensure that Mr Ganesh
doesn’t know of this.

670
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:19,106
Keep this to yourself.

671
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:23,891
Ask Bhavani to arrange

672
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:27,315
for my old house to be sold.
Find a buyer.

673
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,460
Will you be able to manage
everything on your own?

674
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:36,247
I have managed most part
of my life all by myself, Lau.

675
00:39:36,943 --> 00:39:38,052
Will manage the rest too.

676
00:39:40,872 --> 00:39:41,966
Keep the keys.

677
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:50,763
Do I ask him to come?
- How do I meet him if you don’t?

678
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,185
Send him over.
- Okay.

679
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,349
Come in, sir.

680
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,060
Sorry, I am late.

681
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:03,599
Didn't I tell you,

682
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,404
we will meet frequently?

683
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:06,888
I need to talk to you.

684
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:09,161
It's important.

685
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:13,052
Okay, come.
- This way.

686
00:40:18,326 --> 00:40:19,380
Come.

687
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:23,552
Come.

688
00:40:23,802 --> 00:40:25,755
Padma, please come here.

689
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:27,099
Coming.

690
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:29,286
Please be seated.
It's a very small room.

691
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:33,942
You?!

692
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:37,599
I spoke to the doctor.

693
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:41,364
The doctor has asked
to get admitted immediately.

694
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:43,068
Every single day is important.

695
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,544
Actually, there are
many tests to be done.

696
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,044
The surgery can be planned
only after we get the reports

697
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:49,404
of the tests conducted.

698
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:50,716
It's a major surgery. So...

699
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,701
Exactly my point.

700
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:55,002
Delay of 2-4 days
will not make a big difference.

701
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,130
The amount we brought along will
suffice only the admission charges.

702
00:40:57,404 --> 00:40:59,380
Once we arrange
for the complete treatment,

703
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,990
it would be great.

704
00:41:02,341 --> 00:41:04,185
Don’t worry about
all this, Mr Ganesh.

705
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:06,431
I have spoken to him,
all the arrangements will be done.

706
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:07,654
Get admitted tomorrow itself.

707
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:08,841
No, no. Hear me out.

708
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:10,427
Lau is going to
Bangladesh tomorrow.

709
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:13,755
Once he is back with the amount,
I will get admitted.

710
00:41:14,255 --> 00:41:17,185
No delay. You will be admitted
tomorrow and won't wait for him.

711
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:20,185
Keep this Rs. 40000.

712
00:41:20,552 --> 00:41:23,029
I'll arrange for the rest.
- No, why did you take the trouble?

713
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:25,806
Keep it with you.
If needed, we will ask for it.

714
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,044
It is needed now.

715
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,505
If you consider me
as a friend then...

716
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:36,630
Mr Ganesh,

717
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:38,919
you will not return me the money.

718
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,716
Please take it.

719
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,630
Please.

720
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:45,872
Padma,

721
00:41:46,224 --> 00:41:47,341
keep the money.

722
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:50,810
Thank you.

723
00:41:52,255 --> 00:41:54,076
Lau will not be here,

724
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,825
if I get admitted,

725
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,424
she will be alone here.

726
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:00,849
Do take care of her
as it’s a completely new city.

727
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:02,372
Don’t worry about anything.

728
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:04,443
It's just a matter of two days.

729
00:42:05,419 --> 00:42:07,451
Once Lau is back,
there is nothing to worry.

730
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:09,348
Okay.

731
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,091
Are kids permitted

732
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:13,177
to go inside the hospital?

733
00:42:13,707 --> 00:42:14,497
Why?

734
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:15,982
Montu is coming.

735
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,317
I have called him over.

736
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,247
Want to see him once,

737
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,419
before I go for the surgery.

738
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:28,661
Nasir,

739
00:42:29,388 --> 00:42:30,732
will he be permitted inside?

740
00:42:31,786 --> 00:42:33,545
I'll speak to the authorities.

741
00:42:33,665 --> 00:42:37,706
Before he is admitted,
can we go to Kalighat

742
00:42:37,826 --> 00:42:39,177
temple to offer our prayers?

743
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:42,048
I heard that's a powerful deity.

744
00:42:42,638 --> 00:42:43,786
Okay, I will take you there.

745
00:42:44,302 --> 00:42:45,310
Nasir,

746
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:47,888
will they allow you
to enter the temple premises?

747
00:42:50,536 --> 00:42:52,045
It's the temple of Goddess Kali.

748
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:56,201
People of all religions
are same there.

749
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,622
I will take you to the temple,
tomorrow morning.

750
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,656
Thank you, Nasir.

751
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:05,191
Thank you.

752
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:46,153
Is there a bus
available to my hotel?

753
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:49,497
I have taken a leave today.

754
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:51,817
I'll drop you on my bike.

755
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:56,602
Will you be staying
alone in that hotel?

756
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:01,481
You know very well that
I have been staying alone mostly.

757
00:45:02,755 --> 00:45:04,052
That was Shivpur,
this is Kolkata.

758
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:08,059
Do the wolves in the city
have sharper teeth?

759
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:09,260
Yes, they have.

760
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,505
Don't stay alone in that hotel.
The people around are not good.

761
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,530
Will you stay with me?

762
00:45:17,669 --> 00:45:18,840
Dad used to say,

763
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:22,341
whatever you sow, so shall you
reap in this life itself.

764
00:45:23,434 --> 00:45:25,684
Nothing is pending
for the next life.

765
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:28,177
What do you mean
to say by all this?

766
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:30,684
4 years back, I took care
of you at Bangladesh.

767
00:45:31,793 --> 00:45:33,339
Now 4 years later,

768
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:36,325
here in India,

769
00:45:36,872 --> 00:45:38,309
you are taking care of me.

770
00:45:44,739 --> 00:45:45,763
Have you

771
00:45:49,192 --> 00:45:50,871
parked your motor bike downstairs?

772
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,770
Let us go.

773
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:00,575
What are you staring at?

774
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:05,700
Post immersion of
Goddess Durga’s statue,

775
00:46:06,403 --> 00:46:09,872
everything gets dissolved

776
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,411
without any trace.

777
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,606
Nothing has changed.

778
00:46:24,669 --> 00:46:25,684
Come, let us go.

779
00:47:12,584 --> 00:47:13,670
Keys please.

780
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,146
Yes.

781
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:23,444
Go.

782
00:47:39,474 --> 00:47:40,521
Have a seat.

783
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:52,115
Impossible.

784
00:47:52,396 --> 00:47:54,253
You won’t be staying
alone in this hotel.

785
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,427
Impossible?

786
00:47:56,677 --> 00:47:59,099
I won’t stay alone in this hotel!
Then where do I stay?

787
00:47:59,232 --> 00:48:01,449
Will I stay at your home
or will you stay at this hotel?

788
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:03,187
I will do that if required.

789
00:48:04,279 --> 00:48:07,132
You have returned from hospital,
go freshen up.

790
00:48:11,693 --> 00:48:14,789
Smoking under stress,
what are you worried about?

791
00:48:15,607 --> 00:48:18,425
Will your wife Ayesha
be angry if she gets to know?

792
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,197
Ayesha has got married.

793
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:26,938
She stays at Jalpaiguri.

794
00:48:27,575 --> 00:48:28,583
Why?

795
00:48:29,685 --> 00:48:30,795
Let us not discuss all that.

796
00:48:38,193 --> 00:48:39,771
You stay alone here?

797
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:43,497
Yes, on rent.

798
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,536
I share the room with few others.

799
00:48:46,013 --> 00:48:47,021
Yes.

800
00:48:48,443 --> 00:48:49,482
Come in.

801
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:53,896
Has Ganesh Mondal been admitted?
- Yes.

802
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,232
Will you both have dinner at night?

803
00:48:56,709 --> 00:48:58,357
No, we will not need anything.

804
00:48:58,498 --> 00:48:59,521
Okay.

805
00:48:59,912 --> 00:49:02,107
If you need anything, let me know.
- Please listen.

806
00:49:03,404 --> 00:49:05,938
Quickly prepare
the bills for both the rooms,

807
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:07,295
we are checking out.

808
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:08,677
Why?

809
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,396
As I said, prepare the bills, go.

810
00:49:16,217 --> 00:49:17,287
What do you mean?

811
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:20,146
Why do I check out?
- Don’t need to think too much.

812
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:22,131
Pack your luggage immediately.

813
00:49:23,435 --> 00:49:24,517
What nonsense?

814
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:25,797
I said I will manage.

815
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:27,175
I don’t want to hear a word more.

816
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,592
You will not be staying
alone in this hotel.

817
00:49:29,396 --> 00:49:30,412
Pack everything.

818
00:49:30,584 --> 00:49:31,918
You will be staying at my place.

819
00:49:32,482 --> 00:49:34,099
Why are you doing all this?

820
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,256
I will be fine.

821
00:49:36,459 --> 00:49:37,552
I am worried.

822
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:40,983
If I stay with you in this hotel,
you will be looked down upon Padma.

823
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:45,672
I followed everything
you said at your place.

824
00:49:46,873 --> 00:49:48,138
Now listen to me and do as I say.

825
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:49,834
Come on, pack your stuff.

826
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,568
And what about your neighbours?

827
00:49:54,342 --> 00:49:55,396
What will they say?

828
00:49:55,646 --> 00:49:56,763
I will take care of them.

829
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:01,286
What?

830
00:50:03,177 --> 00:50:06,537
Like Subhash, do I need to

831
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,146
adopt a new Muslim name,
to stay at your place?

832
00:50:13,646 --> 00:50:14,763
Padma Haldar.

833
00:50:18,732 --> 00:50:19,787
Mondal.

834
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:28,022
In one lifetime,

835
00:50:30,092 --> 00:50:32,334
I had to adapt to three identities.

836
00:50:34,537 --> 00:50:35,881
Padma Das,

837
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:38,513
Padma Haldar,

838
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:40,881
Padma Mondal.

839
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:14,240
My friend’s wife.

840
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:16,224
They have come to Kolkata
to get him treated.

841
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:17,982
Okay.

842
00:51:18,935 --> 00:51:19,974
Won’t you sleep?

843
00:51:23,693 --> 00:51:25,342
Here? Amongst mosquitoes?

844
00:51:27,568 --> 00:51:29,763
Come, sleep at my place.

845
00:51:30,396 --> 00:51:31,841
No. Nalan, I am fine here.

846
00:51:32,646 --> 00:51:33,654
You will sleep on this bench?

847
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:34,998
You will fall if you move.

848
00:51:35,388 --> 00:51:36,388
Come to my room.

849
00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:39,412
Come.

850
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:50,881
Sit.

851
00:51:57,051 --> 00:52:00,999
Will you have a small peg?

852
00:52:01,706 --> 00:52:02,732
Yes.

853
00:52:08,068 --> 00:52:10,582
Did you have dinner?

854
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:12,296
Yes.

855
00:52:13,654 --> 00:52:14,747
What about her?

856
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:16,810
We had our dinner outside.

857
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,092
From where have they come from?
- Bangladesh.

858
00:52:21,787 --> 00:52:22,810
Very good.

859
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:27,568
I offer prayers daily
near Shri Krishna Medical.

860
00:52:28,654 --> 00:52:32,571
Mr Anand is from Bangladesh.

861
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:35,896
Did you see his wife?

862
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:38,295
She is so lovely.

863
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:41,271
Here you go.

864
00:52:43,474 --> 00:52:44,576
Cheers.

865
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:49,490
Girls from Bangladesh
have an X factor.

866
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:52,611
There is something very attractive.

867
00:52:56,732 --> 00:52:57,810
Sorry, sorry.

868
00:53:01,552 --> 00:53:02,685
I won’t need it.

869
00:53:02,818 --> 00:53:04,404
On the rocks?

870
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:05,959
Okay.

871
00:53:10,974 --> 00:53:14,185
For how many days will she be here?

872
00:53:15,661 --> 00:53:16,693
No idea.

873
00:53:17,592 --> 00:53:19,271
Her husband has been
admitted in the hospital today.

874
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:23,005
She was staying alone
in a hotel near Rashbihari.

875
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:24,521
It wasn’t a good hotel.

876
00:53:25,326 --> 00:53:26,880
We will have to wait
for the reports.

877
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:28,873
Only then the doctors can
advice the line of treatment.

878
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:30,834
Why?
What is he suffering from?

879
00:53:31,638 --> 00:53:32,740
Heart disease.

880
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:34,403
God!

881
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:36,951
I was not aware of all this.

882
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:42,178
Aunt Hema told me,
there's a female at Nasir’s place.

883
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,349
I assumed her a call girl.

884
00:53:44,662 --> 00:53:45,842
Nalan, what is all this...

885
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:47,716
I assumed that’s it.

886
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:52,740
Saw her for the first time.

887
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:55,849
Such a pretty girl
in such a shoddy place. - Nalan...

888
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,802
Did anyone else
say anything about her?

889
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:01,746
No.

890
00:54:03,802 --> 00:54:06,302
I have a question
if you don’t mind.

891
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:08,318
Do you have any feelings for her?

892
00:54:14,779 --> 00:54:15,779
I got it.

893
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:21,482
So it's between us.

894
00:54:21,787 --> 00:54:26,107
If anyone asks, she is
your friend's wife.

895
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:29,630
The story that you said
in the beginning will do.

896
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:33,935
Call if you need more.

897
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:38,870
Tell Mr Ganesh
to have faith in God.

898
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:42,084
Okay.
- And not to worry.

899
00:54:42,256 --> 00:54:44,888
Listen, be careful with Montu.

900
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:46,396
He is very naughty.

901
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:47,927
Don’t worry.

902
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:51,560
Arrange for Sister in law's
old house to be sold.

903
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:54,349
Once everything is arranged,
give us a call.

904
00:54:54,818 --> 00:54:58,029
If your phone does not work,
call from Nizamuddin’s phone booth.

905
00:54:58,497 --> 00:55:01,216
Tell him to write it in
Ganesh sir’s account. - Okay.

906
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:04,427
Uncle, what do you think?

907
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:07,552
I am a small doctor
from a small village.

908
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:09,326
What do I say?

909
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:11,990
It's good that you have taken
him to India for treatment.

910
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:15,717
It hurts when I see such
young fellows suffering.

911
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:18,256
Lokkhi committed suicide,

912
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:19,959
now he is in his death bed.

913
00:55:21,295 --> 00:55:24,248
I have seen them
since their birth Bhavani.

914
00:55:24,826 --> 00:55:27,435
Keep the documents safely.
Do not lose them.

915
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:29,201
Okay.

916
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:32,537
Let's go.

917
00:55:33,888 --> 00:55:35,513
Hey, wait.

918
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,802
I keep forgetting everything.

919
00:55:37,988 --> 00:55:38,914
What?

920
00:55:39,815 --> 00:55:44,045
Your aunt has sent this.
She brought this from the shrine.

921
00:55:44,576 --> 00:55:45,990
Place it under his pillow.

922
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:48,474
God Bless.

923
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,631
Ganesh.

924
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,310
Ganesh.

925
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:00,334
Ganesh.

926
00:56:02,974 --> 00:56:04,076
How are you?

927
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:05,958
Good.

928
00:56:06,692 --> 00:56:07,700
Were you able to sleep well?

929
00:56:07,827 --> 00:56:11,521
How can a person
sleep in this chaos?

930
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:13,771
Why what happened?
- Your nurses.

931
00:56:14,146 --> 00:56:16,529
They neither understand
Hindi nor Bengali.

932
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:18,201
In which language
do I speak to them?

933
00:56:18,888 --> 00:56:20,771
They are from the north east.

934
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:22,513
They don’t sleep.

935
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,537
Middle of the night
they wake me up to sponge,

936
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,693
to apply talcum powder, etc.

937
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:30,138
I said, let me sleep, let me rest.

938
00:56:30,365 --> 00:56:32,467
But they don’t listen.

939
00:56:32,645 --> 00:56:34,271
They just keep on working.

940
00:56:34,779 --> 00:56:38,388
As soon as we get one last report,
I will schedule your surgery.

941
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,271
Okay.
- Don’t worry.

942
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,154
Have faith in me.

943
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,631
Doctor,

944
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,467
the money needed
have been arranged.

945
00:56:47,013 --> 00:56:48,464
You don’t need to
think about anything else.

946
00:56:48,584 --> 00:56:50,763
Please try your best

947
00:56:51,021 --> 00:56:52,615
If I can be saved.

948
00:56:53,615 --> 00:56:55,966
Actually, my son is still very small

949
00:56:56,365 --> 00:57:00,802
and Padma will not be able to
manage alone without me.

950
00:57:01,435 --> 00:57:03,709
Please try if possible.

951
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:05,716
Please.

952
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,451
Sure.

953
00:57:09,568 --> 00:57:10,568
Let us go.

954
00:57:28,974 --> 00:57:30,685
Hare Krishna...

955
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:33,435
Hare Krishna... Hare Krishna...

956
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,201
God Bless you Nasir.

957
00:57:38,193 --> 00:57:39,865
Lower your forehead dear.

958
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:44,459
Yes, Narayan.

959
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,951
I stay in that room.

960
00:57:49,654 --> 00:57:53,029
Do let me know
if you need anything.

961
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:54,560
I am getting late,
let me make a move. - Okay.

962
00:57:54,787 --> 00:57:57,482
Hare Krishna... Hare Krishna...
Hare Krishna... - Come,

963
00:57:58,239 --> 00:57:59,256
let go.

964
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:01,506
Here she comes.

965
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:04,006
Oh, dear!

966
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:06,193
You look so sweet,

967
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:07,537
what is your name?

968
00:58:07,826 --> 00:58:09,427
Padma.
- Okay.

969
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:11,802
Let me have a look.

970
00:58:12,209 --> 00:58:15,068
It’s rare to see girls wearing
conch shell these days.

971
00:58:15,256 --> 00:58:17,114
Aunt, we are getting late,
we need to go to the hospital.

972
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:19,137
Let her stay, we are here.

973
00:58:19,302 --> 00:58:21,833
What nonsense? Her husband
is being treated at the hospital.

974
00:58:22,021 --> 00:58:23,075
Let us go, Padma.

975
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:26,427
Go. Everything will be alright.

976
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:30,974
A Hindu girl at Nasir’s home?

977
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,146
No one cares for
religion these days.

978
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,044
Listen.

979
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,529
Lau is not aware
that I have shifted here.

980
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:39,568
He will be waiting at the hotel.

981
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:41,732
If they don’t find us at the hotel,
they will go to the hospital.

982
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:43,670
But he will go there first.

983
00:58:44,248 --> 00:58:46,263
Let me tell you.

984
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,967
The girl is very pretty.

985
00:58:48,217 --> 00:58:51,967
Mark my words,
Nasir is in love with the girl.

986
00:58:52,177 --> 00:58:53,467
I have a question.

987
00:58:53,918 --> 00:58:54,933
Yes?

988
00:58:56,545 --> 00:58:58,287
You are kidding me.

989
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,326
I am trying to lighten your mood.

990
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:02,622
Do you get it?

991
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:06,224
He is impossible!

992
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:08,302
Hindu sababa...

993
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:09,551
Hey...

994
00:59:11,312 --> 00:59:12,977
The neighbours are good
but just a bit...

995
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,013
That is expected.

996
00:59:20,388 --> 00:59:21,771
They wanted me to let
you stay with them.

997
00:59:24,404 --> 00:59:25,490
Just imagine,

998
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:28,052
they want me to
leave you with them.

999
00:59:28,629 --> 00:59:30,215
I hope Mr Ganesh doesn’t mind
your staying at my place.

1000
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:32,646
You should have thought about it
before you brought me here.

1001
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:34,950
Let us go.

1002
00:59:56,685 --> 00:59:57,771
Since Lau is not here,

1003
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,302
you are admitted here.

1004
01:00:00,342 --> 01:00:02,826
So, I did not let Padma stay
at that hotel at night.

1005
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,630
I took her to my place.
She stayed there.

1006
01:00:06,005 --> 01:00:08,310
When Lau returns,
I will take him to my home.

1007
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:12,099
Once you are cured,
I will take you too to my house.

1008
01:00:13,217 --> 01:00:15,701
Why will you stay at hotel
when I am here?

1009
01:00:17,654 --> 01:00:18,732
Good.

1010
01:00:19,373 --> 01:00:21,294
I hope there is no problem here.

1011
01:00:22,029 --> 01:00:25,857
All your requirements are
been taken care of?

1012
01:00:26,771 --> 01:00:27,834
All is well.

1013
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:30,809
If there is any problem,
please let me know immediately.

1014
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:32,467
Just ask for me,
everyone knows me here.

1015
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:35,224
I am on duty till 8.30pm daily.

1016
01:00:36,622 --> 01:00:37,654
Okay.

1017
01:00:38,107 --> 01:00:39,873
If all of us stay at your place,

1018
01:00:40,232 --> 01:00:42,388
won’t it be inconvenient
for your family?

1019
01:00:42,826 --> 01:00:44,490
Specially Montu.
He is very mischievous.

1020
01:00:44,732 --> 01:00:46,662
It's very difficult to control him.

1021
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:48,045
Everything will be fine.

1022
01:00:48,257 --> 01:00:49,575
And I stay there alone.

1023
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:52,256
Okay.

1024
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:54,286
It's a rented flat.

1025
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:56,687
Just one room, kitchen
and a bathroom.

1026
01:00:57,593 --> 01:00:59,631
I need to report to work,
will be back post my office hours.

1027
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:01,679
If you need anything,
do call me, dma.

1028
01:01:07,412 --> 01:01:08,646
Were you able to sleep yesterday?

1029
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:10,967
Why?

1030
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:12,381
It is a new place,

1031
01:01:12,662 --> 01:01:15,123
and you are worried about me.

1032
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:16,779
So, I asked.

1033
01:01:18,192 --> 01:01:20,630
Just ensure that he does not
spend too much money.

1034
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,967
You pay for most of the expenses.

1035
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,262
Yes.

1036
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,521
Listen.

1037
01:01:28,092 --> 01:01:31,842
Subhash had requested
and crossed the river.

1038
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:35,560
Did Nasir Ali cross the river or
did you keep him to yourself?

1039
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:40,568
What do you mean by all this?

1040
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:44,161
No one knows the meaning of this
better than you and me, Padma.

1041
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:47,693
When you agreed to
marry on one condition,

1042
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:51,779
I was the one to see
the way you were crying, Padma.

1043
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:56,286
Ganesh Mondal is smart enough to
read between the lines.

1044
01:01:57,137 --> 01:01:59,482
Have I ever asked you if you

1045
01:01:59,662 --> 01:02:02,045
love Nasir Ali or not?

1046
01:02:03,817 --> 01:02:04,981
Did I ever ask you?

1047
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:07,497
Then...

1048
01:02:08,426 --> 01:02:11,528
You must be wondering that I'm
jealous and insecure of Nasir Ali.

1049
01:02:11,685 --> 01:02:13,115
Not at all.
In fact, I am very Happy.

1050
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:19,653
I know very well that he will never
let anything bad happen to you.

1051
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:26,477
Is it necessary to discuss all this?

1052
01:02:26,631 --> 01:02:28,217
Everything is in a mess.

1053
01:02:30,771 --> 01:02:32,045
I am short of time.

1054
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:35,576
So Ganesh Mondal needs
to plan everything very carefully.

1055
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:39,896
I will marry,

1056
01:02:40,795 --> 01:02:42,078
only on one condition.

1057
01:02:43,615 --> 01:02:44,787
What condition?

1058
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:46,607
Help Subhash

1059
01:02:47,123 --> 01:02:48,490
to go to India.

1060
01:02:48,701 --> 01:02:49,724
Okay.

1061
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:52,560
Then you will agree to marry me?

1062
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:54,373
What?

1063
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,029
Yes.

1064
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:58,013
Then stop crying.

1065
01:03:00,287 --> 01:03:01,795
What is his real name?

1066
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:05,943
I am sure, his real name
isn't Subhash. I'm smart enough.

1067
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,412
You know that.

1068
01:03:08,445 --> 01:03:09,513
What is his name?

1069
01:03:12,786 --> 01:03:14,044
Nasir Ali.

1070
01:03:16,842 --> 01:03:18,599
If we didn’t change his name,

1071
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:23,012
it was impossible for us
to keep him here.

1072
01:03:25,646 --> 01:03:27,834
He will be leaving
early morning, tomorrow.

1073
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,498
Via Bishashpur cremation ground.

1074
01:03:31,146 --> 01:03:32,592
There will be people
who will help him cross.

1075
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:36,747
You please

1076
01:03:37,474 --> 01:03:39,998
take care of the guards
at the border.

1077
01:03:40,435 --> 01:03:41,865
If they

1078
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:45,934
harm him in any way,

1079
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:47,482
I will...

1080
01:03:48,052 --> 01:03:49,795
You will see me dead.

1081
01:03:51,162 --> 01:03:53,263
You will get my dead body.
- Excuse me.

1082
01:03:54,513 --> 01:03:56,420
Why do you need to
speak all this nonsense?

1083
01:03:57,787 --> 01:03:59,631
Everything will be taken care of.

1084
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:06,271
At least stop crying now.

1085
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:09,997
Padma.

1086
01:05:08,185 --> 01:05:09,255
Nasir,

1087
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:11,521
the reports are not good.

1088
01:05:12,864 --> 01:05:14,864
His heart is very weak.

1089
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:18,364
Operating him in this condition
is impossible.

1090
01:05:19,575 --> 01:05:20,614
Then?

1091
01:05:21,606 --> 01:05:22,919
What do you suggest doctor?

1092
01:05:23,614 --> 01:05:25,755
You can take a second opinion,

1093
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:28,950
but I will not take this risk.

1094
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:31,130
Unnecessarily money will be spent.

1095
01:05:31,513 --> 01:05:32,537
And he won't survive either.

1096
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:34,411
To be very frank,

1097
01:05:34,825 --> 01:05:36,208
it's my duty to explain
everything in detail.

1098
01:05:36,864 --> 01:05:38,357
Unless there is some miracle,

1099
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,348
Ganesh has very limited days.

1100
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:46,168
Doctor,

1101
01:05:46,926 --> 01:05:47,966
is there nothing we can do?

1102
01:05:48,099 --> 01:05:49,255
Atleast I am not aware off.

1103
01:05:50,122 --> 01:05:52,638
You need to tell him the truth.

1104
01:05:53,677 --> 01:05:55,388
He has the right to know everything.

1105
01:05:55,754 --> 01:05:57,004
Just keep him happy.

1106
01:05:57,732 --> 01:06:00,935
I will have him discharged
tomorrow morning.

1107
01:06:01,185 --> 01:06:02,325
Take him home.

1108
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,341
Ensure to give him medicines on time.

1109
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:08,630
Sorry.

1110
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:11,575
Stand Still Montu.

1111
01:08:12,325 --> 01:08:15,184
Let me wipe your hair or
you will fall sick.

1112
01:08:15,919 --> 01:08:17,708
As it is we are facing a
lot of problems,

1113
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,192
don’t add more to it.

1114
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,630
Let me see.

1115
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:23,075
The way it's raining,

1116
01:08:23,763 --> 01:08:25,372
even if we had umbrellas,
it wouldn’t have helped.

1117
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:26,872
Montu, behave yourself

1118
01:08:27,255 --> 01:08:28,551
and you too go and change.

1119
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:30,411
Let me first change his clothes.

1120
01:08:32,646 --> 01:08:34,606
He purposely got wet.
- He is lying.

1121
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:36,145
Keep quiet,

1122
01:08:37,036 --> 01:08:38,232
why did you get wet?

1123
01:08:38,622 --> 01:08:40,325
Where is the bathroom?

1124
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,841
It is outside to your right.

1125
01:08:43,145 --> 01:08:44,145
Wait.

1126
01:08:46,974 --> 01:08:49,099
Mom, India has so many big cities.

1127
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:51,122
Yes.

1128
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,833
May I come in?

1129
01:08:53,169 --> 01:08:55,216
I need few dry clothes.

1130
01:08:55,544 --> 01:08:57,747
Why do you need permission
to enter you own house?

1131
01:08:57,981 --> 01:08:59,035
Come in.

1132
01:08:59,857 --> 01:09:00,888
Turn.

1133
01:09:02,943 --> 01:09:05,372
Change your clothes
or you will fall ill.

1134
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:08,732
I don't fall ill so easily.

1135
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,950
Wait dear.
- You are wet too.

1136
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:12,770
Change your clothes.

1137
01:09:13,271 --> 01:09:14,654
This is unseasonal...

1138
01:09:38,747 --> 01:09:41,052
Mom, why aren't there
so many houses in Shivpur?

1139
01:09:41,864 --> 01:09:44,029
Is there no river at Kolkata?

1140
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,489
What are you...

1141
01:09:47,552 --> 01:09:49,614
There is a river at Kolkata. Ganga.

1142
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:52,357
Mom, whose house is this?

1143
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:56,013
Don’t talk so much.

1144
01:09:57,599 --> 01:09:59,216
When will dad be home?

1145
01:10:03,153 --> 01:10:04,755
Is this your home?

1146
01:10:05,864 --> 01:10:07,138
What is your name?

1147
01:10:10,044 --> 01:10:11,341
My name is Montu.

1148
01:10:12,286 --> 01:10:13,560
His name is also Montu.

1149
01:10:38,215 --> 01:10:39,457
Go, change your clothes.

1150
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:40,948
Yes.

1151
01:11:01,441 --> 01:11:02,449
Brother!

1152
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,255
What is your name?

1153
01:11:11,138 --> 01:11:12,325
Kartik Mondal.

1154
01:11:15,724 --> 01:11:17,591
Dad is Ganesh and I am Kartik.

1155
01:11:18,802 --> 01:11:20,403
What is your name?

1156
01:11:20,668 --> 01:11:21,668
Nasir Ali.

1157
01:11:21,755 --> 01:11:23,028
Oh, you are a Muslim?

1158
01:11:24,396 --> 01:11:25,575
I am Hindu,

1159
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:26,896
my mom is hindu,

1160
01:11:27,107 --> 01:11:28,380
my dad is also hindu,

1161
01:11:28,521 --> 01:11:29,732
my Lau is also hindu.

1162
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,193
Your dad is a Muslim?

1163
01:11:34,404 --> 01:11:36,724
What about your mom?
Is she a Muslim too?

1164
01:11:39,286 --> 01:11:40,458
This is my car,

1165
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,371
Isn’t it good?

1166
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:44,545
Do you have one?

1167
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:04,966
Whenever you wish to have,

1168
01:12:05,232 --> 01:12:06,911
just come and have one.

1169
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:13,552
Thank you.

1170
01:12:14,098 --> 01:12:15,192
I need to sleep.

1171
01:12:16,177 --> 01:12:17,896
Last 2 days have been very hectic.

1172
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:20,013
Couldn’t sleep a bit.

1173
01:12:20,858 --> 01:12:21,895
Be seated,

1174
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:23,466
have some more.

1175
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:25,693
it’s the best medicine for sleep.

1176
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,177
What is your occupation?

1177
01:12:32,004 --> 01:12:33,019
Hey...

1178
01:12:33,818 --> 01:12:36,387
I offer prayers in shops in
the morning,

1179
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:40,177
then I work in press in the evening

1180
01:12:40,685 --> 01:12:41,935
and at night this.

1181
01:12:42,185 --> 01:12:43,263
Very simple.

1182
01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:45,646
Nalan,

1183
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:48,075
I will bother you for few more days.

1184
01:12:48,716 --> 01:12:51,427
Ganesh sir will be discharged
from the hospital tomorrow.

1185
01:12:52,614 --> 01:12:53,716
He has very few days to live.

1186
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,060
I wish they stay with me

1187
01:12:57,677 --> 01:12:58,747
for these few days.

1188
01:12:59,778 --> 01:13:00,786
Let them stay.

1189
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,075
We both have one room each,

1190
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,441
don’t worry.

1191
01:13:06,997 --> 01:13:08,208
Is it true that

1192
01:13:08,747 --> 01:13:10,161
he Won’t survive?
- No.

1193
01:13:12,161 --> 01:13:13,474
Doctor has lost all hopes.

1194
01:13:15,364 --> 01:13:18,785
But if you see him, you Won’t believe.

1195
01:13:20,207 --> 01:13:21,207
Lau,

1196
01:13:22,622 --> 01:13:24,146
we need to be strong.

1197
01:13:26,661 --> 01:13:29,716
I am indebted to them Nalan.

1198
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:35,591
Dear...

1199
01:13:37,474 --> 01:13:38,575
Padma, did you have your meal?

1200
01:13:39,646 --> 01:13:41,263
No.
- Good.

1201
01:13:41,661 --> 01:13:43,138
I have prepared Banana gravy,

1202
01:13:43,559 --> 01:13:44,637
do taste it.

1203
01:13:45,044 --> 01:13:46,122
Sure.

1204
01:13:47,154 --> 01:13:48,966
Hold. I heard your husband
has a heart disease.

1205
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:50,849
Yes.

1206
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:52,825
Heard his condition is not good.

1207
01:13:53,614 --> 01:13:54,622
Yes.

1208
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:57,380
If you need anything, do call me.

1209
01:13:58,083 --> 01:13:59,857
I hardly sleep at night.

1210
01:14:00,434 --> 01:14:01,449
Sure.

1211
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:03,997
Don’t worry, everything
will be fine dear.

1212
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:20,919
What are you thinking?

1213
01:14:21,597 --> 01:14:22,911
You never informed me.

1214
01:14:25,505 --> 01:14:26,763
What would you have done
if I informed you?

1215
01:14:27,818 --> 01:14:29,771
You would have gone and
told everyone that

1216
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:33,568
he is not Ganesh Sir’s but my son?

1217
01:14:38,052 --> 01:14:39,599
Just giving birth

1218
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:41,505
does not make you a father Nasir Ali.

1219
01:14:46,575 --> 01:14:47,501
Ganesh Sir has fed him.

1220
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:49,217
Go to your room, I
will serve your meal.

1221
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:05,396
Now we just need to come
for regular check up.

1222
01:15:05,872 --> 01:15:07,185
We need to come for
the follow up next week.

1223
01:15:07,387 --> 01:15:08,404
What?

1224
01:15:08,779 --> 01:15:10,872
Doctor has discharged you,
so why are you still not happy?

1225
01:15:10,966 --> 01:15:12,411
It’s all accumulated inside.

1226
01:15:12,898 --> 01:15:14,614
Will get it out
when the time is right.

1227
01:15:14,864 --> 01:15:17,247
Getting excited is not good for me.

1228
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:19,480
We are all staying at Nasir’s place.

1229
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:21,208
Padma and Montu are
waiting there for us.

1230
01:15:21,396 --> 01:15:23,247
Why are you troubling him?
We can arrange for a hotel.

1231
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:24,747
Why do we need to discuss
this topic again?

1232
01:15:24,974 --> 01:15:27,896
We have already spoken about it
that you will come to my house.

1233
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:30,872
If I would not have met you,
it was different.

1234
01:15:31,216 --> 01:15:33,926
No, you're being stubborn now.
- Not a word anymore.

1235
01:15:34,277 --> 01:15:36,747
You will stay with me. You will
have to pay if put up in a hotel.

1236
01:15:37,091 --> 01:15:39,310
Why waste money unnecessarily?

1237
01:15:39,565 --> 01:15:41,043
Mr Ganesh...

1238
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:42,456
He is right.

1239
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,042
Did I ask for your opinion?

1240
01:15:44,404 --> 01:15:46,724
Don’t speak if you have no idea
of the situation.- Please listen.

1241
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,653
This is not Bangladesh,
this is india.

1242
01:15:50,997 --> 01:15:52,002
This is my country.

1243
01:15:52,308 --> 01:15:53,808
So you have to follow what I say.

1244
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:57,177
Beyond Icchamati, you rule.
Here, it is Nasir Ali who rules.

1245
01:15:57,544 --> 01:15:58,544
Am I clear?

1246
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:00,310
Let us put an end
to this discussion.

1247
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:01,974
Let us go.

1248
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:03,505
Come.

1249
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,716
Come.

1250
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,747
Come.

1251
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,958
Come.

1252
01:16:10,739 --> 01:16:11,833
Come.

1253
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:16,356
Nasir.

1254
01:16:18,395 --> 01:16:19,801
Nasir, are you at home?

1255
01:16:20,403 --> 01:16:21,419
Nasir, are you at home? Nasir? Nasir?

1256
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,239
Nasir?

1257
01:16:25,974 --> 01:16:27,067
Nasir?

1258
01:16:33,784 --> 01:16:35,120
Is Nasir at home?

1259
01:16:35,927 --> 01:16:36,997
He is...

1260
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:38,896
He is not at home.

1261
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:40,529
He has gone to the hospital.

1262
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:43,286
He will be back in an hour.

1263
01:16:44,318 --> 01:16:45,348
Okay.

1264
01:16:50,943 --> 01:16:52,419
Do you have any message?

1265
01:16:53,216 --> 01:16:54,997
Tell him that Mr Suraj had come.

1266
01:16:55,512 --> 01:16:56,521
Okay.

1267
01:16:56,716 --> 01:16:57,802
How are you related to him?

1268
01:17:00,224 --> 01:17:01,270
He has already conveyed to all.

1269
01:17:04,346 --> 01:17:05,529
Who are you?

1270
01:17:06,318 --> 01:17:07,802
You can ask that to Nasir Ali.

1271
01:17:07,989 --> 01:17:09,043
Well...

1272
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:12,029
Mom!

1273
01:17:17,974 --> 01:17:19,404
Nalan, listen.

1274
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:20,974
What happened?

1275
01:17:21,393 --> 01:17:22,427
Mr Suraj has come

1276
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:24,638
looking for Nasir.
He will be back again in some time.

1277
01:17:24,802 --> 01:17:25,966
Come soon.

1278
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,463
Go ahead, I will be there.

1279
01:17:44,075 --> 01:17:45,786
When Nasir is back,
ask him to call me.

1280
01:17:46,231 --> 01:17:48,185
The child and the bald man
came yesterday.

1281
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,083
On the first night,
there was no one else.

1282
01:17:50,325 --> 01:17:51,489
Nasir and the lady were alone.

1283
01:17:51,724 --> 01:17:54,255
If we don’t stop him now, he might
continue bringing girls here.

1284
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:57,333
Don’t let them know
that I have told you about this.

1285
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,211
Dad.

1286
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:05,068
Montu is here.

1287
01:18:05,282 --> 01:18:07,302
Dad, will you take me
or sightseeing around Kolkata?

1288
01:18:07,505 --> 01:18:08,536
Yes,

1289
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:10,411
definitely.

1290
01:18:10,614 --> 01:18:13,310
First tell me, did you have any
trouble while coming here?

1291
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,349
No, no. I travelled by boat
and rickshaw.

1292
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,208
You travelled by Train too.

1293
01:18:17,896 --> 01:18:20,930
Yes, I travelled by train
and taxi too.

1294
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:24,731
Oh my god! You have travelled by
all these mode of transport.

1295
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:26,196
It seems you have come from Japan.

1296
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:28,106
Come, come.

1297
01:18:28,356 --> 01:18:29,435
Get these inside.

1298
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:31,160
Keep it there.

1299
01:18:31,352 --> 01:18:32,430
Padma,

1300
01:18:32,704 --> 01:18:34,547
see the demo and understand it.

1301
01:18:34,829 --> 01:18:36,024
If you are unable to operate it,
don’t worry I am here.

1302
01:18:36,477 --> 01:18:39,266
What is it? - That is oxygen.
Come here. How much does it cost?

1303
01:18:40,243 --> 01:18:41,735
It has air inside.

1304
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,774
Fan too gives us air.

1305
01:18:44,047 --> 01:18:45,532
No end to his questions.

1306
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:47,177
Let me explain.

1307
01:18:47,524 --> 01:18:51,040
Doctor has sent this for me.

1308
01:18:51,195 --> 01:18:54,078
He has added medicine in the
air filled inside.

1309
01:18:54,493 --> 01:18:55,649
Listen.

1310
01:18:55,766 --> 01:18:57,594
Liakar uncle has sent this for you.

1311
01:19:00,211 --> 01:19:01,469
Okay. Will let you know if needed.

1312
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:03,805
Thank you.

1313
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:06,820
Pay for all the expenses
Nasir has been doing or

1314
01:19:06,915 --> 01:19:08,516
he will need this
oxygen cylinder very soon.

1315
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,138
Do not worry about all this.

1316
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:12,508
Padma, I have bought groceries
and kept it in the kitchen.

1317
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,641
Just check and let me know if
anything more is required.- Okay.

1318
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:23,453
Is he home?
- Yes.

1319
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:24,844
Ask him to come here.

1320
01:19:47,461 --> 01:19:48,602
Yes, tell me.

1321
01:19:48,943 --> 01:19:50,234
It is you who has to answer me.

1322
01:19:50,711 --> 01:19:52,656
Nasir, I had rented
this flat to you.

1323
01:19:53,008 --> 01:19:54,680
It is not a guest house.

1324
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:56,352
What are these people doing here?

1325
01:19:57,008 --> 01:19:58,297
They have come from Bangladesh.

1326
01:19:58,782 --> 01:20:00,079
They are my friends.

1327
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:02,876
He is unwell and will stay here
for a few days for his treatment.

1328
01:20:03,148 --> 01:20:04,967
So you do not need
my permission for it?

1329
01:20:05,154 --> 01:20:07,969
Permission? For treatment?
- Don’t act too smart.

1330
01:20:08,665 --> 01:20:10,086
I wont allow so many
people to stay here.

1331
01:20:10,282 --> 01:20:12,734
Suraj, he is a patient.
Let him stay.

1332
01:20:13,196 --> 01:20:15,055
After all, they are our guest.

1333
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:16,696
Aunt, please go to your room.

1334
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,407
Nasir, ask them to arrange
their stay at some other place.

1335
01:20:20,086 --> 01:20:22,883
It doesn’t look good. On the first
day, these people were not there.

1336
01:20:23,101 --> 01:20:24,116
I heard,

1337
01:20:24,243 --> 01:20:26,867
you and that lady
spent the night together.

1338
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,313
Does it look good?

1339
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,407
We need to take care of our culture.

1340
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,461
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.

1341
01:20:38,196 --> 01:20:40,344
I heard your voices inside.
What’s the matter?

1342
01:20:40,485 --> 01:20:42,196
Wait Nalan, wait.
Let me speak to him.

1343
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:43,790
If someone from my family was ill,

1344
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:46,039
wouldn’t he be able to stay here?

1345
01:20:46,296 --> 01:20:48,577
Yes. Our country is very tolerant.
Could have definitely stayed here.

1346
01:20:48,773 --> 01:20:49,891
Anyone could have stayed.

1347
01:20:50,102 --> 01:20:51,672
But aren’t there any rules?

1348
01:20:51,797 --> 01:20:54,626
What rules are you talking about?
And why drag religion here?

1349
01:20:55,274 --> 01:20:57,696
Mr Suraj, you are unnecessarily
complicating the matter.

1350
01:20:57,954 --> 01:20:59,001
Look, they...

1351
01:21:01,883 --> 01:21:02,977
They are my family.

1352
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,188
They will stay here with me.

1353
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:08,828
Who gave you this information?

1354
01:21:09,258 --> 01:21:11,508
What if they stay
in the house together?

1355
01:21:11,727 --> 01:21:13,001
Let me clear one thing.

1356
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:15,602
Nasir has been staying at my place
since the day she has arrived here.

1357
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,204
Why do you need to
explain him all this?

1358
01:21:17,805 --> 01:21:19,469
He has insulted all of us.

1359
01:21:20,735 --> 01:21:22,758
I pay the rent on time.

1360
01:21:23,413 --> 01:21:26,657
So, he'll stay here with his wife
and son and get himself treated.

1361
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,969
If you are capable,
then throw us out.

1362
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:30,633
You are instigating the fight.

1363
01:21:30,961 --> 01:21:32,047
Mr Suraj,

1364
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:33,719
they have come from
another country.

1365
01:21:34,093 --> 01:21:35,062
They are my guest.

1366
01:21:35,204 --> 01:21:37,219
You insulted me in front of them.

1367
01:21:37,446 --> 01:21:39,321
Today, after seeing and
hearing all this...

1368
01:21:39,586 --> 01:21:41,937
What will they think about us,
the people of Kolkata? - Hold on.

1369
01:21:42,157 --> 01:21:44,875
No, I cannot calm down.
- This is unfair.

1370
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:47,657
Let us sit at night
and sort it out over drinks.

1371
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:50,454
We will sit, discuss
and resolve the issue.

1372
01:21:50,735 --> 01:21:52,876
How many days will they be
staying here? - Again...

1373
01:21:53,102 --> 01:21:54,251
What is this, Mr Suraj?

1374
01:21:54,626 --> 01:21:56,094
Let it go, Nalan.

1375
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:59,430
Nasir, you go inside.

1376
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:01,422
When you rented the flat to Nasir,

1377
01:22:01,765 --> 01:22:03,523
I started respecting you.

1378
01:22:04,376 --> 01:22:06,055
Why are you doing this?

1379
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:09,219
Please don’t mind.

1380
01:22:10,016 --> 01:22:11,313
Who is the patient?

1381
01:22:11,569 --> 01:22:12,938
Me sir.

1382
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:14,790
Don't worry.

1383
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:16,649
As per the doctors,

1384
01:22:16,852 --> 01:22:18,516
I wont be troubling you
for many days.

1385
01:22:19,547 --> 01:22:21,336
You need not worry about anything.

1386
01:22:21,913 --> 01:22:23,398
Lau, let's go.

1387
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:24,695
Come, let's go.

1388
01:22:27,946 --> 01:22:29,672
Come.

1389
01:22:31,664 --> 01:22:32,672
Come.

1390
01:22:43,079 --> 01:22:44,157
Come Montu, come with me.

1391
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:45,547
Come.

1392
01:22:57,368 --> 01:22:58,868
Have a seat.

1393
01:22:59,829 --> 01:23:00,946
Sit down.

1394
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:12,727
Sorry Ganesh sir.
- Why are you sorry?

1395
01:23:12,915 --> 01:23:15,040
These people...
- We should be sorry.

1396
01:23:15,368 --> 01:23:17,829
This the reason why I was insisting
on staying at a hotel.

1397
01:23:18,055 --> 01:23:20,079
That won’t be needed.
Its settled now.

1398
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,376
Hey,

1399
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:27,954
did you marry?

1400
01:23:31,899 --> 01:23:33,516
You didn’t marry?

1401
01:23:33,844 --> 01:23:35,821
Didn’t like any one or just
flirting away your time?

1402
01:23:37,454 --> 01:23:39,829
No.
- I do not have any such relations.

1403
01:23:39,969 --> 01:23:41,672
You are a bachelor staying alone,

1404
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:43,680
yet you dared to bring Padma here.

1405
01:23:44,852 --> 01:23:46,434
Then I had to spend the night
at the hotel with her.

1406
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:47,204
Would it have been good?

1407
01:23:47,242 --> 01:23:48,931
No, no. You made the right decision.

1408
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:51,624
She too had given you
shelter at her place.

1409
01:23:51,649 --> 01:23:52,595
Didnt she Subhash?

1410
01:23:57,258 --> 01:23:58,735
Let me know if you need anything.

1411
01:23:59,016 --> 01:24:01,024
Are you asking me,

1412
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,906
for my last wish?

1413
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,836
Take us for sight seeing
around Kolkata.

1414
01:24:07,226 --> 01:24:10,796
It's not just my wish. Montu
wanted to see Victoria memorial,

1415
01:24:10,954 --> 01:24:12,766
and the Howrah bridge.

1416
01:24:14,157 --> 01:24:16,415
Take us for a tour to these places.

1417
01:24:17,657 --> 01:24:18,868
What happened, Mr Ganesh?

1418
01:24:19,608 --> 01:24:20,704
Nothing.

1419
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:23,157
Just felt giddy.

1420
01:24:23,813 --> 01:24:25,688
It keeps happening at times.

1421
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:28,649
Don't worry. I am fine.

1422
01:24:28,852 --> 01:24:30,071
No, no. We need to see the doctor...

1423
01:24:31,461 --> 01:24:32,790
Have your tea.

1424
01:24:33,343 --> 01:24:34,351
Give.

1425
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,705
Ganesh sir wishes to tour Kolkata.

1426
01:24:37,696 --> 01:24:38,993
Let us all go together.

1427
01:24:39,876 --> 01:24:41,954
Buy a bigger motor bike,

1428
01:24:42,282 --> 01:24:43,977
so that we can all go together.

1429
01:24:50,641 --> 01:24:52,235
Difficult times ahead.

1430
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:54,461
Things will get worse.

1431
01:24:55,805 --> 01:24:57,954
Both of us are
in difficult situation.

1432
01:24:58,813 --> 01:25:00,079
I will die in few days,

1433
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:02,711
but you will be alive.

1434
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,844
What have you planned Nasir Ali?

1435
01:25:06,782 --> 01:25:08,032
Why?

1436
01:25:08,461 --> 01:25:10,805
Both of us are concerned
about the same person.

1437
01:25:11,195 --> 01:25:12,218
Padma.

1438
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:14,586
We both are worried for her future.

1439
01:25:15,188 --> 01:25:16,360
You are worried for her too.

1440
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:17,883
Yes,

1441
01:25:19,438 --> 01:25:20,438
I am worried.

1442
01:25:21,868 --> 01:25:22,954
I worried for the kid as well.

1443
01:25:23,195 --> 01:25:24,366
He is still to young.

1444
01:25:28,188 --> 01:25:31,063
I need to discuss few things
with you when you have time.

1445
01:25:31,688 --> 01:25:35,539
If I am unable to arrange for them then
I wont be at pace even after I die.

1446
01:25:35,774 --> 01:25:36,819
What arrangement?

1447
01:25:37,313 --> 01:25:39,516
I will let you know,
don’t be impatient.

1448
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:40,813
I'll tell you.

1449
01:25:41,563 --> 01:25:42,578
Hey.

1450
01:25:44,118 --> 01:25:45,243
Why didn’t you marry?

1451
01:25:46,149 --> 01:25:47,594
Such a handsome man

1452
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:49,415
why haven’t you married yet?

1453
01:25:55,196 --> 01:25:57,234
Were you able to love anyone
other than Padma?

1454
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,821
I too was unable to love anyone else.

1455
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:54,123
Why are you removing the mask,

1456
01:28:54,724 --> 01:28:56,912
it's difficult for you
to breath without it.

1457
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,326
No.

1458
01:28:58,544 --> 01:29:01,591
I feel suffocated putting it on.

1459
01:29:02,396 --> 01:29:03,497
What nonsense.

1460
01:29:05,482 --> 01:29:06,779
What did doctor say?

1461
01:29:08,459 --> 01:29:10,037
The next follow up is in
the following week.

1462
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:12,841
In case you are not well
the we need to

1463
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:14,911
call him.

1464
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:19,474
He wont operate?

1465
01:29:23,576 --> 01:29:24,607
Not now.

1466
01:29:25,224 --> 01:29:26,239
When will he operate?

1467
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:29,287
once you are a bit stable.

1468
01:29:31,427 --> 01:29:32,481
Padma,

1469
01:29:32,904 --> 01:29:34,177
don’t lie.

1470
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:35,739
You know I don’t fear death.

1471
01:29:35,973 --> 01:29:36,973
Look...

1472
01:29:37,124 --> 01:29:40,537
If its time, I will go,
no one will be able to stop me.

1473
01:29:41,473 --> 01:29:43,824
Its my right to know.
I am the one suffering.

1474
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:48,334
What do you want to know?
What will you do once you know?

1475
01:29:52,716 --> 01:29:54,146
You will be free once dead.

1476
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:57,130
Have you thought about
me and Montu?

1477
01:30:02,537 --> 01:30:03,537
Hey.

1478
01:30:05,153 --> 01:30:06,177
Hey.

1479
01:30:08,412 --> 01:30:09,513
What did the doctor say?

1480
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,646
Wont be able to operate?

1481
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:15,974
No.

1482
01:30:18,388 --> 01:30:21,560
Didn’t he say I have 1% chance.

1483
01:30:24,037 --> 01:30:25,325
What do I do now?

1484
01:30:28,013 --> 01:30:29,021
Just keep waiting.

1485
01:30:32,974 --> 01:30:34,255
Why do you ask so many questions?

1486
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:36,779
Cant you make out from my face?

1487
01:30:47,685 --> 01:30:48,709
Padma.

1488
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,894
What happened?

1489
01:30:54,693 --> 01:30:55,787
Where is Montu?

1490
01:30:57,138 --> 01:30:58,193
Here I am.

1491
01:30:58,787 --> 01:30:59,849
My Montu?

1492
01:31:01,654 --> 01:31:02,787
Here I am.

1493
01:31:09,146 --> 01:31:10,209
Whats wrong?

1494
01:31:11,576 --> 01:31:12,787
I informed him that

1495
01:31:13,951 --> 01:31:15,287
the doctor have denied to take
chances operating him.

1496
01:31:17,715 --> 01:31:18,826
Look after him. Move.

1497
01:31:19,005 --> 01:31:20,090
Padma.

1498
01:31:28,966 --> 01:31:30,451
Twinkle twinkle little star...

1499
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:32,896
Twinkle twinkle little star...

1500
01:31:33,794 --> 01:31:34,841
Recite with me.

1501
01:31:35,037 --> 01:31:36,123
Yes.

1502
01:31:38,099 --> 01:31:40,278
Twinkle twinkle little star.

1503
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,505
Twinkle twinkle little star...

1504
01:31:42,645 --> 01:31:44,786
How I wonder what you are?

1505
01:31:44,919 --> 01:31:46,950
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.

1506
01:32:02,287 --> 01:32:03,505
Are you in pain?

1507
01:32:06,802 --> 01:32:07,833
No.

1508
01:32:08,513 --> 01:32:09,576
Tomorrow the chariots of Lord Jagannath
will be taken through the city.

1509
01:32:10,029 --> 01:32:11,724
Nalan said he will be

1510
01:32:12,287 --> 01:32:13,865
offering prayers to
lord Jagannath for you.

1511
01:32:15,349 --> 01:32:16,693
The prayer is for you.

1512
01:32:21,146 --> 01:32:22,146
Wait.

1513
01:32:24,692 --> 01:32:26,075
What will you wish for?

1514
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,240
Don’t bother the lord anymore.

1515
01:32:29,771 --> 01:32:30,896
Everyone around

1516
01:32:31,521 --> 01:32:33,943
the world just keeps on

1517
01:32:34,435 --> 01:32:36,755
making demands.

1518
01:32:36,998 --> 01:32:39,959
Doesnt he gets tired
fulfilling all our wishes.

1519
01:32:40,982 --> 01:32:42,396
Such a monotonous task.

1520
01:32:42,748 --> 01:32:45,396
Just pray for
the wellbeing of everyone.

1521
01:32:46,349 --> 01:32:48,786
Okay then ask for the
wellbeing of all tomorrow.

1522
01:32:49,716 --> 01:32:50,763
Lau,

1523
01:32:51,435 --> 01:32:53,240
please ask Padma to come here.

1524
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:56,355
Take care of Montu and do
not allow him to come here.

1525
01:32:56,691 --> 01:32:58,459
What are you thinking Lau? Go.

1526
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:02,121
What are you thinking Lau? Go.

1527
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:09,762
You...

1528
01:33:10,826 --> 01:33:12,037
Do you need to talk to
us about something important?

1529
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:13,387
Need to discuss few things

1530
01:33:13,927 --> 01:33:15,981
to ensure the wellbeing of everyone.

1531
01:33:16,451 --> 01:33:18,404
I don’t have any hidden agenda.

1532
01:33:21,285 --> 01:33:22,980
Come.
- What happened?

1533
01:33:25,357 --> 01:33:26,701
He wants to say something.

1534
01:33:26,919 --> 01:33:29,349
I have always achieved
everything in life.

1535
01:33:29,834 --> 01:33:32,560
I went to extremes to marry you.

1536
01:33:33,224 --> 01:33:34,748
I now realize,

1537
01:33:35,044 --> 01:33:38,029
you could not marry
the person you loved.

1538
01:33:38,584 --> 01:33:40,731
Padma, I compelled you to marry me.

1539
01:33:40,927 --> 01:33:42,544
I never cared if
you wanted to marry me.

1540
01:33:43,029 --> 01:33:46,605
What is the use of discussing
these now? - Yes.

1541
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:48,495
It is high time that we sort this out.

1542
01:33:49,084 --> 01:33:50,709
I am waiting outside, call me once
you both finish discussing this.

1543
01:33:50,794 --> 01:33:52,840
Oh God, why don’t you understand
what I want to say?

1544
01:33:52,946 --> 01:33:55,941
Please wait here sir.
She loved you

1545
01:33:56,029 --> 01:33:58,128
like crazy. Still
she married me.

1546
01:33:58,247 --> 01:33:59,707
Such a great sacrifice and
you are running away?

1547
01:34:00,076 --> 01:34:03,005
Yes. Because I don’t have
anything to say on this topic.

1548
01:34:03,505 --> 01:34:05,974
You might not have anything to say.

1549
01:34:06,812 --> 01:34:08,771
But you could definitely do something.

1550
01:34:09,989 --> 01:34:12,090
You had not seen her cry.
I would have agreed to anything

1551
01:34:12,194 --> 01:34:14,014
if a drop of tear had
fallen from her eye for me.

1552
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:16,748
I don’t want our personal matters to be

1553
01:34:16,966 --> 01:34:18,856
discussed in presence of Nasir.

1554
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,130
Wait Nasir.

1555
01:34:23,943 --> 01:34:24,998
Padma. I hardly have time.
Please hear me out.

1556
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:26,865
I hardly have time.

1557
01:34:28,052 --> 01:34:29,919
Please hear me out.

1558
01:34:30,326 --> 01:34:31,677
I won’t be there.

1559
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:35,318
How will you manage everything
on your own?

1560
01:34:40,974 --> 01:34:42,974
I was a widow staying alone
in that lonely house.

1561
01:34:43,294 --> 01:34:44,529
Stop it now.

1562
01:34:45,021 --> 01:34:47,732
I served my bedridden
father in law for years.

1563
01:34:48,654 --> 01:34:49,740
I agree,

1564
01:34:50,052 --> 01:34:52,084
you compelled to marry you.

1565
01:34:54,521 --> 01:34:56,255
But after our marriage
did I ever neglect

1566
01:34:56,388 --> 01:34:58,099
any of my duty as your wife?

1567
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:01,201
Did you ever feel the neglected by me?

1568
01:35:04,849 --> 01:35:05,935
Yes,

1569
01:35:08,474 --> 01:35:10,115
I love him.

1570
01:35:11,544 --> 01:35:12,787
I love him a lot.

1571
01:35:14,443 --> 01:35:15,927
That does not mean,

1572
01:35:16,193 --> 01:35:18,209
I will give up my family for him.

1573
01:35:25,263 --> 01:35:28,099
Didn’t we lead a happy
married life for so many years?

1574
01:35:28,529 --> 01:35:30,287
Didn't we?

1575
01:35:31,013 --> 01:35:32,740
Then how can you say this?

1576
01:35:34,067 --> 01:35:36,622
Yes, you love Nasir.

1577
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:40,537
It's not always possible to
marry the person you love.

1578
01:35:40,912 --> 01:35:42,356
When you have him,
don’t let him go.

1579
01:35:45,404 --> 01:35:46,630
I will die soon.

1580
01:35:46,927 --> 01:35:48,958
Then both of you together
take care of Montu.

1581
01:35:50,373 --> 01:35:52,177
You will inherit everything
that belongs to me.

1582
01:35:52,341 --> 01:35:56,216
Dare if you every repeat
all this again!

1583
01:35:57,177 --> 01:35:58,271
Padma...

1584
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,528
What did you do?
Padma is your wife.

1585
01:36:02,193 --> 01:36:04,060
You insulted her
in the presence of an outsider.

1586
01:36:04,294 --> 01:36:06,584
No, I didn’t insult her.
- Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

1587
01:36:07,599 --> 01:36:09,576
We do not need to
agree to all your wishes.

1588
01:36:10,544 --> 01:36:11,755
Disgusting!

1589
01:36:12,404 --> 01:36:14,966
How could you think
that I am waiting for you to die?

1590
01:36:15,443 --> 01:36:16,873
And I will marry Padma
once you are not alive.

1591
01:36:17,302 --> 01:36:18,568
You have misunderstood Nasir Ali.

1592
01:36:19,255 --> 01:36:22,326
You compelled her to marry you.
I will never compel her.

1593
01:36:23,605 --> 01:36:25,208
She gave her all to the marriage.

1594
01:36:25,912 --> 01:36:27,763
Let us not get into it.

1595
01:36:29,044 --> 01:36:30,630
She has become ice,

1596
01:36:31,287 --> 01:36:34,130
with no emotions or feeling.

1597
01:36:34,778 --> 01:36:36,302
It is only you Nasir Ali,

1598
01:36:37,248 --> 01:36:39,834
who can melt the ice.

1599
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:45,294
You have my word,
I will never repeat this in my life.

1600
01:36:45,502 --> 01:36:48,919
Take the responsibility
of Padma and Montu.

1601
01:36:51,716 --> 01:36:53,138
Just think of it.

1602
01:36:53,258 --> 01:36:56,810
God has given you an opportunity
seeing your true love for her.

1603
01:36:58,115 --> 01:37:00,138
Mine is just one sided love.

1604
01:37:00,724 --> 01:37:02,654
Please never ever
repeat this Ganesh sir.

1605
01:37:03,959 --> 01:37:05,427
Didn’t you just see,
Padma loves you.

1606
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:08,693
She loves and respects
the position of husband.

1607
01:37:08,919 --> 01:37:10,232
Ganesh Mondal could

1608
01:37:10,568 --> 01:37:12,162
never get anyone’s affection.

1609
01:37:13,693 --> 01:37:14,896
But you got it.

1610
01:37:15,498 --> 01:37:16,709
You convince her.

1611
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:19,341
She will understand.

1612
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:22,419
Nasir,

1613
01:37:22,552 --> 01:37:25,302
when you needed,
I helped you to escape.

1614
01:37:25,818 --> 01:37:28,279
Now it’s your turn to help me
and let me die in peace.

1615
01:37:30,013 --> 01:37:31,443
Give me your word

1616
01:37:33,935 --> 01:37:35,263
that you will not

1617
01:37:37,521 --> 01:37:38,904
leave her alone.

1618
01:37:39,388 --> 01:37:41,779
Don’t let her lead her life
with a fake identity.

1619
01:37:42,429 --> 01:37:44,506
Please accept her.

1620
01:37:44,806 --> 01:37:46,226
Accept her.

1621
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:02,248
Don’t let her be alone.

1622
01:38:10,658 --> 01:38:11,615
Don’t worry. I am here.

1623
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:15,369
I will take care.

1624
01:38:56,767 --> 01:38:57,724
Hope everything is fine.

1625
01:39:03,964 --> 01:39:06,823
Nalan said if you
pull the threads of the chariot

1626
01:39:07,357 --> 01:39:09,396
and make a wish,
it comes true.

1627
01:39:09,649 --> 01:39:10,906
You go pull.

1628
01:39:15,615 --> 01:39:17,492
If my wish is not fulfilled?

1629
01:39:18,014 --> 01:39:19,247
Don’t ask for

1630
01:39:19,666 --> 01:39:21,987
something impossible.

1631
01:39:24,533 --> 01:39:26,122
Won’t you pull?

1632
01:39:26,429 --> 01:39:27,486
I will pull

1633
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:29,100
but will not ask for anything.

1634
01:39:32,084 --> 01:39:33,986
Why? Why won’t you
make a wish?

1635
01:39:36,039 --> 01:39:38,673
Aren’t you a gentleman?

1636
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,638
Shouldn’t you be maintaining

1637
01:39:42,114 --> 01:39:44,060
your distance from other females?

1638
01:39:44,704 --> 01:39:46,356
Go.

1639
01:40:12,997 --> 01:40:14,083
Nasir,

1640
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:16,490
ask Ganesh sir to
come over for the blessings.

1641
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:17,919
Everybody, cover your feets.

1642
01:40:18,039 --> 01:40:19,940
Holy water should not
fall on your feets.

1643
01:40:52,568 --> 01:40:55,232
Where is Ganesh sir?
- He was resting in the room.

1644
01:40:55,584 --> 01:40:57,240
No he is not there inside.
I checked the washroom too.

1645
01:40:57,474 --> 01:40:58,544
Let me check Nalan’s room.

1646
01:41:01,443 --> 01:41:03,614
Ganesh sir. Ganesh sir.

1647
01:41:05,013 --> 01:41:06,357
Lau,

1648
01:41:06,576 --> 01:41:07,533
he is not in there.

1649
01:41:07,653 --> 01:41:09,307
Where did he go on his own?

1650
01:41:09,427 --> 01:41:11,255
He left on his own.

1651
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:12,396
Let’s go look for him.

1652
01:41:12,544 --> 01:41:15,138
Let’s go look for him.

1653
01:41:16,193 --> 01:41:17,521
Come let’s go.

1654
01:41:17,943 --> 01:41:20,013
Has he ever left
the house on his own?

1655
01:41:20,177 --> 01:41:21,255
No.

1656
01:41:22,107 --> 01:41:23,841
Okay. We will look for him.

1657
01:43:58,968 --> 01:44:00,484
Just take care of Montu.

1658
01:44:34,031 --> 01:44:35,117
We tried looking for him

1659
01:44:38,726 --> 01:44:39,757
everywhere possible.

1660
01:44:40,789 --> 01:44:43,054
Actually, it’s a very big
and crowded city.

1661
01:44:44,797 --> 01:44:47,508
Can’t approach the police as
you’ll don’t have the documents.

1662
01:44:48,312 --> 01:44:49,874
It might lead to another chaos.

1663
01:44:53,179 --> 01:44:54,210
Padma,

1664
01:44:55,078 --> 01:44:56,172
please be strong.

1665
01:44:56,523 --> 01:44:57,875
Tomorrow morning
I will look for him again.

1666
01:44:58,281 --> 01:44:59,328
We will surely find him.

1667
01:45:02,851 --> 01:45:04,664
You will never find him.
- What?

1668
01:45:13,663 --> 01:45:14,687
What is that?

1669
01:45:28,843 --> 01:45:29,881
Padma.

1670
01:45:30,086 --> 01:45:31,312
Suicide is the only option
left to me.

1671
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:34,164
I am leaving as I don’t want to
increase your suffering.

1672
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:42,086
Do not waste your energy
looking for me.

1673
01:45:42,664 --> 01:45:44,500
Don’t be sad as wherever I die,

1674
01:45:45,024 --> 01:45:46,375
people will definitely
perform the last rites.

1675
01:45:46,495 --> 01:45:48,559
Ganesh Mondal was an orphan

1676
01:45:48,742 --> 01:45:50,531
who had no loved once.

1677
01:45:50,968 --> 01:45:53,007
No one loved him.

1678
01:45:53,547 --> 01:45:55,023
There's nothing to be
sad about.

1679
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:01,163
It was just for his capabilities

1680
01:46:01,461 --> 01:46:03,265
and intelligence

1681
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:05,086
that made him

1682
01:46:05,375 --> 01:46:08,492
a successful man.

1683
01:46:09,008 --> 01:46:10,351
Now you are free.

1684
01:46:10,961 --> 01:46:11,976
Be healthy

1685
01:46:12,139 --> 01:46:13,678
and happy only then

1686
01:46:13,992 --> 01:46:15,242
I will be in peace.

1687
01:46:15,492 --> 01:46:18,183
I am sure you will take

1688
01:46:18,303 --> 01:46:21,304
good care of Montu.

1689
01:46:42,258 --> 01:46:43,335
Mom,

1690
01:46:44,468 --> 01:46:46,038
where is dad?

1691
01:47:02,328 --> 01:47:05,101
Where is dad?

1692
01:47:13,906 --> 01:47:14,914
Nalan,

1693
01:47:16,476 --> 01:47:18,461
any news?

1694
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:21,984
Aunt. It’s late,

1695
01:47:22,828 --> 01:47:23,843
go sleep.

1696
01:47:24,359 --> 01:47:26,320
Good or bad, do keep us informed.

1697
01:47:27,945 --> 01:47:28,953
Bye.

1698
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:02,851
What are you thinking?

1699
01:48:04,789 --> 01:48:05,945
I was wondering,

1700
01:48:07,351 --> 01:48:08,781
if I have to store these clothes

1701
01:48:10,375 --> 01:48:13,179
in the suitcase just like
the clothes of Ratan Haldar?

1702
01:48:15,429 --> 01:48:17,015
Its just like playing with dolls.

1703
01:48:18,273 --> 01:48:19,726
Everytime you decorate

1704
01:48:20,453 --> 01:48:21,883
the dollhouse it breaks.

1705
01:48:23,179 --> 01:48:24,195
Let me try once,

1706
01:48:24,648 --> 01:48:25,890
maybe I will find him tomorrow.

1707
01:48:31,718 --> 01:48:32,937
What is the use of the file?

1708
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:36,093
My destiny will not change.

1709
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,242
I cannot take it anymore.

1710
01:48:38,898 --> 01:48:40,703
I have no other option

1711
01:48:41,508 --> 01:48:42,508
but spend

1712
01:48:42,843 --> 01:48:44,554
the life alone.

1713
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:48,883
Now you have Montu.

1714
01:48:50,406 --> 01:48:52,117
Montu cannot fill the loneliness.

1715
01:48:53,023 --> 01:48:54,797
You won’t lose a thing.

1716
01:48:58,241 --> 01:48:59,265
Not even a

1717
01:48:59,656 --> 01:49:02,242
scratch on your body.

1718
01:49:04,405 --> 01:49:06,077
I am not scared of getting hurt.
The decision is yours.

1719
01:49:07,218 --> 01:49:08,734
Stop this here.

1720
01:49:09,624 --> 01:49:10,648
It’s not the right time

1721
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,695
to discuss these things.

1722
01:49:15,008 --> 01:49:16,625
It won't look good
if we discuss this now.

1723
01:49:20,773 --> 01:49:23,422
However, I cannot let you
stay alone at Shivpur.

1724
01:49:24,171 --> 01:49:25,475
This is also a kind of suicide.

1725
01:49:28,194 --> 01:49:29,225
Padma.

1726
01:49:30,883 --> 01:49:32,172
He is my son.

1727
01:49:33,093 --> 01:49:34,250
Please rethink.

1728
01:49:34,570 --> 01:49:35,765
I have some right and so,
I'm saying this.

1729
01:49:36,898 --> 01:49:38,054
Think the other perspective.

1730
01:49:38,265 --> 01:49:39,351
What do I rethink?

1731
01:49:41,648 --> 01:49:43,187
What should I think about?

1732
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:45,461
We need to build his future.

1733
01:49:45,836 --> 01:49:47,609
I will take all his responsibility.

1734
01:49:48,328 --> 01:49:49,664
I will educate him.

1735
01:49:50,758 --> 01:49:52,218
I was not even aware
of his existence.

1736
01:49:53,156 --> 01:49:54,726
Why do I need to stay alone?

1737
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:59,062
I have given my word to Ganesh sir

1738
01:49:59,304 --> 01:50:00,984
but that is my look out.

1739
01:50:01,336 --> 01:50:02,343
You need not worry about it.

1740
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:04,851
Our son will go to good school
and college in Kolkata.

1741
01:50:05,234 --> 01:50:07,054
He will have a good job.

1742
01:50:07,288 --> 01:50:08,530
I will raise him well.

1743
01:50:08,945 --> 01:50:10,179
I will take
all his responsibilities.

1744
01:50:11,281 --> 01:50:12,343
What about me?

1745
01:50:13,922 --> 01:50:15,140
What will I do?

1746
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:17,593
What?

1747
01:50:17,867 --> 01:50:19,304
I did everything
just for you, Padma.

1748
01:50:19,883 --> 01:50:22,203
I never cared for anything else.

1749
01:50:22,953 --> 01:50:23,953
I never thought of anything.

1750
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,140
I do not care about the society.

1751
01:50:31,358 --> 01:50:32,358
Please stay here, Padma.

1752
01:50:33,547 --> 01:50:35,336
Why do you want to go back?

1753
01:50:36,726 --> 01:50:37,742
Padma...

1754
01:50:38,195 --> 01:50:39,289
I will arrange.

1755
01:50:39,523 --> 01:50:41,351
I will arrange
for your Identity card.

1756
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:42,937
Please stay here.

1757
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:47,327
I had said the same long back.

1758
01:50:49,703 --> 01:50:51,406
Please stay back Nasir Ali,

1759
01:50:53,398 --> 01:50:55,937
I will have you
fake documents made.

1760
01:50:58,984 --> 01:51:01,070
But you couldn’t wait

1761
01:51:02,687 --> 01:51:04,242
to return to India.

1762
01:51:05,132 --> 01:51:06,257
Back then you had your

1763
01:51:07,976 --> 01:51:09,336
lady love Ayesha
waiting for you here.

1764
01:51:12,054 --> 01:51:14,117
Whom do you have
there to go back to?

1765
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:19,093
Padma.

1766
01:51:19,297 --> 01:51:20,343
You do not have to stay with me.

1767
01:51:20,742 --> 01:51:22,734
I will arrange for another room.
Please stay back.

1768
01:51:26,586 --> 01:51:28,304
Padma, he is my son too.
Please don't take him away.

1769
01:51:29,741 --> 01:51:31,601
Let me contribute
a little in his upbringing.

1770
01:51:32,405 --> 01:51:33,450
Please, Padma.

1771
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:34,578
Please.

1772
01:51:36,726 --> 01:51:39,616
I have given my word to Ganesh sir

1773
01:51:40,664 --> 01:51:43,066
that I will take care of
both you and Montu.

1774
01:51:43,629 --> 01:51:44,855
You will stay here.

1775
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:47,222
My opinion has no value.

1776
01:51:49,933 --> 01:51:52,394
Don’t play games with me Nasir.

1777
01:51:54,004 --> 01:51:55,277
You men will decide everything

1778
01:51:55,519 --> 01:51:57,527
and I need to abide by it

1779
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:00,465
just like Draupadi.

1780
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:03,903
You will decide everything
and I have to abide by it!

1781
01:52:05,543 --> 01:52:07,121
When did I say so?

1782
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,004
Then how could you promise
without consulting me?

1783
01:52:10,402 --> 01:52:13,323
You are misunderstanding me Padma.
- Not at all.

1784
01:52:13,465 --> 01:52:16,207
Who is Ganesh Mondal to decide,

1785
01:52:16,308 --> 01:52:17,996
whom I should marry?

1786
01:52:18,355 --> 01:52:19,957
I will lead my life
on my own terms.

1787
01:52:20,636 --> 01:52:22,996
That is why I am requesting
you to stay here.

1788
01:52:23,745 --> 01:52:24,761
Please stay back.

1789
01:52:26,628 --> 01:52:29,651
Do not go away with my son
making me lonely all over again.

1790
01:52:34,301 --> 01:52:35,582
Why are you so adamant?

1791
01:52:35,972 --> 01:52:37,207
Just because you said,

1792
01:52:37,691 --> 01:52:38,840
I left everything and came here.

1793
01:52:39,121 --> 01:52:41,815
Never looked back.

1794
01:52:42,261 --> 01:52:43,769
I gave up all illegal activities

1795
01:52:46,488 --> 01:52:48,160
and changed for good.

1796
01:52:49,597 --> 01:52:50,629
I missed you very much, everyday.

1797
01:52:58,129 --> 01:52:59,261
Let me go.

1798
01:52:59,629 --> 01:53:01,316
Let me go Nasir.

1799
01:53:07,504 --> 01:53:10,894
If you truly love me
then let me go.

1800
01:53:12,988 --> 01:53:14,746
This will be good for everyone.

1801
01:53:15,910 --> 01:53:17,261
No one will be happy Padma.

1802
01:53:18,879 --> 01:53:22,956
Neither you nor me.

1803
01:53:24,073 --> 01:53:27,488
It will not be good for
our son as well.

1804
01:53:28,691 --> 01:53:29,933
You are blind,

1805
01:53:30,715 --> 01:53:31,863
you will not understand.

1806
01:53:32,957 --> 01:53:34,855
Do you understand destiny?
Destiny?

1807
01:53:36,051 --> 01:53:38,824
I am destined to be a widow.

1808
01:53:43,496 --> 01:53:45,222
I guess Montu has fallen asleep.

1809
01:53:45,441 --> 01:53:46,801
Will you please bring him here?

1810
01:54:42,652 --> 01:54:44,816
On my recommendation, you will get
a job at the hospital.

1811
01:54:47,129 --> 01:54:48,371
Together we can live

1812
01:54:49,957 --> 01:54:50,988
as a happy family.

1813
01:54:53,597 --> 01:54:54,746
We can take another house on rent.

1814
01:54:56,652 --> 01:54:57,879
We can get a good house

1815
01:54:59,667 --> 01:55:00,675
for 4 to 5 thousand.

1816
01:55:01,207 --> 01:55:02,238
I can arrange one.

1817
01:55:09,113 --> 01:55:10,128
What are you looking at?

1818
01:55:11,574 --> 01:55:13,199
You cannot even wait
until the man is dead.

1819
01:55:14,062 --> 01:55:15,889
Its been only 1 day that he is
missing. You want to claim him dead

1820
01:55:16,009 --> 01:55:18,060
make me a widow
and enforce your decision on me.

1821
01:55:20,058 --> 01:55:21,230
I did not know

1822
01:55:22,011 --> 01:55:24,300
you to be as adamant as
Ganesh sir.

1823
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:33,261
You and my son

1824
01:55:35,238 --> 01:55:36,301
both are at my place

1825
01:55:37,285 --> 01:55:39,699
but still I have no rights on you.

1826
01:55:42,379 --> 01:55:43,871
I know you very well Padma.

1827
01:55:44,910 --> 01:55:47,082
I you are determined you will not
listen to anyone and do what

1828
01:55:48,363 --> 01:55:49,472
you have decided.

1829
01:55:50,207 --> 01:55:51,277
You got married

1830
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:53,785
to Ganesh Mondal

1831
01:55:54,136 --> 01:55:55,394
in the same way.

1832
01:55:59,894 --> 01:56:01,144
Just like Ganesh sir,

1833
01:56:03,136 --> 01:56:05,144
I am short of time too Padma.

1834
01:56:16,082 --> 01:56:18,855
Ganesh Mondal
never disrespected me.

1835
01:56:20,441 --> 01:56:23,168
My wish was his command.

1836
01:56:24,449 --> 01:56:27,496
He fulfilled all my wishes.

1837
01:56:28,121 --> 01:56:30,261
How do I cheat him?

1838
01:56:33,527 --> 01:56:35,699
Don’t think about me Nasir Ali.

1839
01:56:37,526 --> 01:56:39,565
If you ever happen to
come to our country,

1840
01:56:41,816 --> 01:56:43,894
you will find me at Bangladesh.

1841
01:56:46,605 --> 01:56:48,863
He belonged to that country.

1842
01:56:51,129 --> 01:56:53,254
His final rites will be
performed there.

1843
01:57:10,129 --> 01:57:11,316
Are you really going back?

1844
01:57:13,769 --> 01:57:15,230
Last time you left.

1845
01:57:18,465 --> 01:57:19,965
This time let me go.

1846
01:57:22,261 --> 01:57:23,918
I have been cheated the most.

1847
01:57:28,066 --> 01:57:30,152
After you leave,

1848
01:57:32,566 --> 01:57:33,879
I will be lonely again.

1849
01:57:35,754 --> 01:57:36,824
Go,

1850
01:57:37,683 --> 01:57:38,769
I will not stop you.

1851
01:57:39,426 --> 01:57:40,480
Go.

1852
01:57:45,418 --> 01:57:46,894
Just pray that Montu

1853
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:50,347
grows up into a good human

1854
01:57:52,035 --> 01:57:55,488
just like his father.

1855
01:58:14,496 --> 01:58:15,543
What?

1856
01:58:16,574 --> 01:58:17,597
Fool.

1857
01:58:20,066 --> 01:58:21,355
You are a fool.

1858
01:58:23,957 --> 01:58:25,988
Trying to read a woman’s heart?

1859
01:58:29,535 --> 01:58:30,566
Impossible.

1860
01:58:30,894 --> 01:58:32,246
Twinkle twinkle little star.

1861
01:58:34,058 --> 01:58:35,285
How I wonder,

1862
01:58:36,863 --> 01:58:38,402
what you are?

1863
01:58:40,308 --> 01:58:41,488
Up above

1864
01:58:43,566 --> 01:58:45,254
the world so high.

1865
01:59:23,886 --> 01:59:24,941
Let me hold.

1866
01:59:26,691 --> 01:59:29,331
Hurry up or
you will not get a seat.

1867
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:33,301
Today we will be going by boat.

1868
01:59:34,457 --> 01:59:35,918
If you have any news,

1869
01:59:36,129 --> 01:59:37,558
please call me.

1870
01:59:38,308 --> 01:59:39,371
Let us go Montu.

1871
01:59:39,965 --> 01:59:40,972
Nasir Ali,

1872
01:59:48,738 --> 01:59:50,160
I love you alot.

1873
01:59:50,535 --> 01:59:52,480
I cannot bear to see you hurt.

1874
01:59:53,027 --> 01:59:56,394
I am destined to be a widow.

1875
01:59:58,746 --> 02:00:00,722
I do not want to marry you

1876
02:00:02,605 --> 02:00:03,683
and lose you

1877
02:00:05,183 --> 02:00:07,894
so please stay away from me.

1878
02:00:09,215 --> 02:00:10,441
Take care.

1879
02:00:11,066 --> 02:00:12,965
Hey. Got it?

1880
02:00:13,730 --> 02:00:15,926
I won't take a chance again.

1881
02:00:16,605 --> 02:00:18,152
Because of my destiny,

1882
02:00:18,886 --> 02:00:20,371
if you are harmed,

1883
02:00:20,949 --> 02:00:22,464
I won't be able to tolerate that.

1884
02:00:24,371 --> 02:00:25,870
Look at me.

1885
02:00:27,308 --> 02:00:28,386
Stay happy.

1886
02:00:32,355 --> 02:00:33,371
Hey...

1887
02:00:35,777 --> 02:00:36,793
Do you understand?

1888
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:41,371
You're a fool

1889
02:00:48,386 --> 02:00:49,949
Padma, hurry.
We are late.

1890
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:52,199
Bye.

1891
02:02:46,660 --> 02:02:48,082
Lau, carry this bag.

1892
02:03:07,277 --> 02:03:08,582
How are you, Montu?

1893
02:03:08,886 --> 02:03:10,176
Dad...

1894
02:03:10,418 --> 02:03:11,738
Where did you go, dad?

1895
02:03:12,121 --> 02:03:13,301
My son.

1896
02:03:16,254 --> 02:03:17,449
Go, sit in the car.

1897
02:03:19,832 --> 02:03:20,879
What's your name?

1898
02:03:27,035 --> 02:03:29,191
Go. Load the luggage in the car.

1899
02:03:32,746 --> 02:03:34,636
I have a white shirt in the car.

1900
02:03:35,238 --> 02:03:36,496
If you hadn't come today,

1901
02:03:36,715 --> 02:03:39,004
I would have worn it

1902
02:03:39,629 --> 02:03:41,230
and returned home all alone.

1903
02:03:41,519 --> 02:03:44,941
The truth is I was in doubt.

1904
02:03:45,457 --> 02:03:46,746
I felt that you and Nasir

1905
02:03:47,019 --> 02:03:49,886
will be happy if I am dead.

1906
02:03:50,676 --> 02:03:52,551
It seemed that you both

1907
02:03:52,754 --> 02:03:55,316
are waiting for me to die.

1908
02:03:57,636 --> 02:03:59,176
As soon as I die,

1909
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:01,301
you both will get married.

1910
02:04:03,215 --> 02:04:05,324
But you are back
and I am relieved.

1911
02:04:06,683 --> 02:04:08,769
Now I can die in peace, Padma.

1912
02:04:10,246 --> 02:04:11,246
Thank you.

1913
02:04:11,675 --> 02:04:12,683
Let us go.

1914
02:04:13,551 --> 02:04:16,120
The most important thing is
if I need to die,

1915
02:04:16,371 --> 02:04:18,742
I will die on my own bed,
in my country with my loved ones.

1916
02:04:18,965 --> 02:04:20,381
Why do I die in India?

1917
02:04:20,879 --> 02:04:21,902
Come, let’s go.

1918
02:04:24,199 --> 02:04:25,215
What are you thinking?

1919
02:04:28,136 --> 02:04:29,340
Come.

1920
02:04:29,816 --> 02:04:31,285
Let us go.

1921
02:04:33,144 --> 02:04:34,300
Give me the bag.
