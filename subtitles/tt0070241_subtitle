1
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,108
You've come!

2
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,580
You've lost a lot of weight!

3
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,549
- Take off the luggage!
- Yes, rightaway.

4
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,584
Let me carry it.

5
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:15,055
Madam, Kunwar has arrived!

6
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,605
After so many days, suddenly,
without any intimation?

7
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,241
Does one have to give an intimation
to go to one's own home?

8
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,411
Sameer, how long would you continue
to roam around like this?

9
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,409
You've come home after
such a long time.

10
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:41,586
I've returned after 7 months.
I went around the whole of India.

11
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,088
I met great artists.

12
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:50,091
Now I'll live here, make pictures,
and be with you.

13
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,263
- Do you really mean it?
- Yes, of course.

14
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,264
- Greetings.
- Bless you.

15
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:00,100
- What did Pratap say?
- He won't agree at any cost.

16
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,032
What are you saying?

17
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,039
I even lured him with an offer
of 25,000 rupees.

18
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,715
But that rascal is hellbent on
spoiling this family's name.

19
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,044
Queen Mother...we'll have
to go to the courts.

20
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,050
To the courts? What's
the matter, mother?

21
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:22,059
Do you know Pratap who lives at
our old mansion across the lake?

22
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,391
That drunkard? He's a crook!

23
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,062
Yes. He has filed
a case against us.

24
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,202
He wants a fifty per cent
share in our property.

25
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,406
Why? What's his connection
with our property?

26
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,070
Explain to him everything.
I'll go and meet the lawyer.

27
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,581
What's the matter?

28
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,585
In the eyes of the world,
we've no connection with Pratap.

29
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,091
But, in reality, he too has your
father's blood in his veins.

30
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,419
What're you saying, mother?

31
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:04,034
Nobody except I, Diwanji and Pratap's
mother knew about this secret.

32
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:13,040
But now even Pratap knows about it,
and he wants to take undue advantage.

33
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,372
Your father had told me everything.

34
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,047
Before marriage, he'd a relationship
with a woman called Prabhadevi.

35
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,057
Pratap is a consequence
of his mistake.

36
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,426
- But you never told me about it?
- Because the matter had ended.

37
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:37,068
To atone for his mistake, your
father had left behind...

38
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,405
...the old cottage and a lot of
wealth in favour of that woman.

39
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,071
That's why he wants to
blackmail us.

40
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,078
People respected your father
till he was alive.

41
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:59,251
Now that he is no more, I don't
want his reputation to be tarnished.

42
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:06,031
Don't worry. I will meet Pratap
today and settle the matter.

43
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,694
Come close...why are you
getting so scared?

44
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,538
Come on...drink it.
That's nice.

45
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,442
Sir, you'll have to come out
for a while.

46
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,546
- Ask that person to come tomorrow.
- He won't return till he meets you.

47
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,374
- Who is he?
- Your father's second progeny.

48
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,385
How did Sameer come here?

49
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:51,068
Sameer...the only son of
the late Kulwant Rai?

50
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:55,575
Also the only successor of
his wealth and property.

51
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,682
So you know everything.

52
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:05,018
And you don't want that
I get my lawful share.

53
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:10,193
You would've got your share
if you were a legitimate son.

54
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,027
The man because of whom you're
leading a comfortable life...

55
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,031
...you want to smear the good
name of that very person?

56
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:28,041
- What do you intend to say?
- You'll have to withdraw the case.

57
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,045
Nothing is impossible for
people like you.

58
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:41,718
Because for a person like you,
money means everything.

59
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,595
Tell me...how much
money do you want?

60
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,066
You want to make a deal with me?

61
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,064
I have brought 50,000 rupees.

62
00:07:54,173 --> 00:08:01,011
The worth of reputation of Kulwant
Rai's family is merely a 50,000?

63
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,547
1 lakh?

64
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,343
I can give you 5 lakhs
to silence you.

65
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,014
Even if you pay me 5 crores,
I don't want alms from anybody.

66
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,519
I've filed a case
against you because...

67
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,693
...I want my father's name to
be associated with mine.

68
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:27,029
Without which a person has no
identity in society.

69
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,709
Without which a person
is known as a bastard.

70
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,375
I want to tell the world that...

71
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:43,382
...this supposed noble person
was, in fact, a despicable person.

72
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:54,058
Your father was an affluent playboy.
He made my mother his keep.

73
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,603
My mother died out
of embarrassment.

74
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,003
I have to take revenge
from your family...

75
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:13,344
...so that you and your mother
lead a life of embarrassment.

76
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,683
I had come to explain to you that
you should withdraw the case.

77
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,025
Remember...when you
leave the court...

78
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:31,035
...the whole world will know
that you are truly a bastard.

79
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:43,047
I beg of you...kill me if you wish,
but withdraw the case.

80
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,048
- So you were overhearing?
- Yes.

81
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,385
I made a big mistake.

82
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:59,397
When I heard of his death,
I told you everything.

83
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,066
If you had told me earlier...

84
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:07,234
...I would've got my due
share a long time ago.

85
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,076
You never lacked anything in life.
He provided you with everything.

86
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,081
Whatever that rascal gave...

87
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,075
...it was the price for having
spent a few nights with you...

88
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,585
- ...and for my illegitimate birth.
- Don't say so about him.

89
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,254
He was a noble person.

90
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:32,453
Only I know how he supported me by
taking me away from a life of hell.

91
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,105
By making you his keep?

92
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,570
It was better if I had died
before seeing such a day.

93
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,113
If you hadn't been my mother,
I would've fulfilled your wish.

94
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,445
If Mr. Pratap Rai's mother,
Mrs. Prabhadevi were alive today...

95
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,051
...her testimony alone would
have helped solve the case.

96
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,386
But she died six months ago.

97
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:11,427
But to prove that she was the
married wife of Kulwant Rai...

98
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,069
...I want to present my first
witness, Mr. Kishanlal Khatri.

99
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,571
You've the permission.

100
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,576
Did you know that Kulwant Rai
had married Prabhadevi?

101
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,083
- I know.
- How do you know?

102
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,081
They were married in my presence.

103
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:36,417
Yes, I had got Kulwant Rai married
to Prabhadevi according to customs.

104
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,624
It's a lie.
Utter nonsense.

105
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,423
Who's this woman?

106
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,430
This woman can prove every evidence
to be incorrect and wrong.

107
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,435
She is Mrs. Prabhadevi,
the mother of Mr. Pratap...

108
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,435
...who is supposed to have
died six months ago.

109
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,179
This woman should be
taken to the witness box.

110
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,055
What's your name?

111
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,430
Are you the wife of Kulwant Rai?

112
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:21,436
No, I was never married to him.
I could've never married him.

113
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:27,074
Because I wasn't fit
to become his wife.

114
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:33,417
Your son wants to prove that he
is the son of Kulwant Rai.

115
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,087
Is it the truth?

116
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:41,087
My son is foolish.

117
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,091
He has no right over
Kulwant Rai's property.

118
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,266
Kulwant Rai was a noble person.

119
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,268
I can never forget the
favours done to me by him.

120
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:02,040
I will never let his good name
to be tarnished till I'm alive.

121
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,568
- Good morning.
- Bless you.

122
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,571
- When did you arrive?
- Just now.

123
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,412
Speak to me in Hindi.

124
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,414
- When will Daddy return?
- By tomorrow evening.

125
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:46,086
- By tomorrow evening?
- Sit with me for some time.

126
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,590
Your studies too have ended now.

127
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,092
I don't have any girlfriend here.

128
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,425
I don't enjoy here more
than a couple of days.

129
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,528
This time perhaps you might enjoy
longer. Sameer too has returned.

130
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,200
- There he is.
- I will be back.

131
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,042
- When did this trouble come?
- Am I trouble?

132
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,039
You heard me?

133
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:19,716
I'll be staying here this time.
I've done my B.A. Studies are over!

134
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,558
You won't study further?

135
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,261
Are you troubled because
of my living here?

136
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:30,400
I am in a mood to seriously
paint these days.

137
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,570
And I don't like any disturbance.

138
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,732
What if I help you
with your paintings?

139
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,575
- Have you started painting now?
- Am I that foolish?

140
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:48,410
By helping, I meant that I can model
for you, if you need.

141
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:53,087
I will mix colours for you, and
clean your brushes too.

142
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,292
- Are you very fond of cleaning?
- Yes.

143
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,427
Then clean utensils
in the kitchen.

144
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,099
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

145
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,010
Sit for some more time.

146
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,005
Who are you?

147
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:16,015
Neither of us knows each other.
But I am making your painting.

148
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,182
If you go away, my painting
will remain incomplete.

149
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:25,529
My painting...? Why do you
want to make my painting?

150
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,025
Instead, make a painting
of this lake and the hills.

151
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:38,041
I've made all that. But I couldn't
make a painting of a girl like you.

152
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,711
I will be late. I have
to return home.

153
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,045
- Where do you live?
- In the settlement across the lake.

154
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,549
Who else is there in your family?

155
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,383
There's father, and
there's my mother.

156
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,725
What does your father do?

157
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,599
Father has two horses.
He lets out horses on hire.

158
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:08,068
He takes people to visit the
Shiva temple on that hill.

159
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,400
- What's your name?
- Neelu.

160
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,403
- Do you come here every day?
- Yes.

161
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,079
- To feed the fishes?
- Yes. Is the painting complete?

162
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,090
Please sit forjust a
little while longer.

163
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,091
- What's this, sir?
- A flower was missing in your hair.

164
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:43,107
You are very beautiful.

165
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,611
Come and have a look. But I still
need to fill the colours.

166
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,122
Come and see...why are
you standing there?

167
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,058
I cannot see.

168
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,229
- What?
- Yes.

169
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,723
I am blind.

170
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:19,069
But you were just mentioning
about the lake...the hills?

171
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:26,441
Those are memories from my
childhood...when I could see.

172
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:33,089
I have seen all colours...green,
blue, yellow...

173
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:39,089
I can see only black colour
now...that of darkness.

174
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,099
- Neelu
- Chiku?!

175
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,261
You took out the rabaab (stringed
musical instrument) after many days?

176
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:57,101
I remembered mother
all of a sudden.

177
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,536
When mother was alive, father used
to play on the rabaab for her.

178
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:09,546
After mother passed away, father
never touched the rabaab.

179
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:16,056
- Has your father not returned yet?
- He did. But he went out again.

180
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,061
He must've gone to
the liquor den.

181
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:24,397
Why don't you make him
cut down on his drinking?

182
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:32,070
I tried a lot. But father says that
there's no happiness anywhere...

183
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,074
...and that he forgets his
miseries by drinking.

184
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,671
So I keep quiet.

185
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:43,080
That witch is the only cause of the
miseries of you and your father.

186
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:48,088
- She's my mother, however she is.
- She's your step-mother.

187
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,624
If I had such a mother, I would
have pushed her into the well.

188
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,634
Who were you pushing into a well?

189
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,261
What have you got for me
from the fair?

190
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,530
- A shoe!
- Don't beat me.

191
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:08,039
Rascal, if you ever come here again,
I will punish you severely.

192
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:12,044
Get lost from here, you rascal!

193
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:16,382
Were you beckoning your lover
by playing on the rabaab?

194
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,054
- Mother!
- Shut up, you blind girl!

195
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,388
- Has your father returned?
- No.

196
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,395
He must be lying in some
gutter after having got drunk.

197
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,597
- Have you prepared the meals?
- Yes.

198
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,733
Then get up and serve it.

199
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,069
Hurry up.

200
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:43,080
It's so dark. You haven't
even lighted a lamp yet.

201
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,083
It's dark? I didn't know.
I'll light it rightaway.

202
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:57,094
Let it be. Serve the food
quickly. I'm feeling hungry.

203
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,419
Come, mother. The food is served.

204
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,247
I am coming.

205
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,023
You have overcooked
the vegetable!

206
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,529
- Is it?
- Let your father eat it.

207
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:18,041
- Hey! There's no salt in it.
- I will get it rightaway.

208
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,381
- Here, mother.
- Put it here.

209
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:37,060
Hey! You spoiled the food.

210
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,063
You spoiled my food deliberately.

211
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,570
- Don't beat me, mother.
- Should I worship you then?

212
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,073
You blind girl!

213
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,349
Why are you beating the
poor girl so severely?

214
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,522
Ask your darling daughter.

215
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,522
- What happened, dear?
- Nothing, father.

216
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:15,365
I made the mistake of putting too
much salt in mother's food.

217
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,036
Mistake? If you could've your way,
you would feed me poison.

218
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,773
Where from would she get poison?

219
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,038
All the poison in the world
is stocked within you.

220
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,379
What? You see me as poisonous?

221
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:33,046
When you had married me,
you used to hanker around me.

222
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,053
I thought that you were a woman
when I married you.

223
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,222
I didn't know that you would
prove to be a poisonous snake.

224
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:45,060
Was your first wife, her
mother, a goddess?

225
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,857
Don't you dare say anything
about Neelu's mother?

226
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,234
You are nothing in comparison.

227
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,063
- Please stop, father.
- Curse me even more.

228
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:59,072
- What else can you do?
- Please calm down, mother.

229
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,008
Don't you dare
call me your mother?

230
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:09,015
I wonder why my parents got me
married to this drunkard old man.

231
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:13,017
Are you feeling enraged
by what I've said?

232
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,521
Go and hear what the people
in the neighbourhood say.

233
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,363
People say that I married
a lowly woman.

234
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:23,567
They also say that the old man
has spoiled my youth.

235
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,536
Get lost from here, or
else I will murder you.

236
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,039
Father...father!

237
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,039
I committed the sin.
And you're paying for it.

238
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:45,055
I'm helpless, daughter.
Bear with it till you can.

239
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:56,563
Alcohol is sure to cause my death
some day. I'll be free then.

240
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:03,005
No...I wish to die,
but I won't.

241
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:08,007
What will happen of my blind,
helpless girl after I'm dead?

242
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,010
Who will care for her?

243
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:16,348
Father...eat food.

244
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,024
Have you eaten?

245
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,027
How can I eat without
first serving you?

246
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,362
Be seated, daughter.

247
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:33,036
You serve me so much. And
what do you get in return?

248
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,036
That woman's abuses and beatings?

249
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:43,539
Despite being your father, I cannot
eliminate your miseries.

250
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,579
I am very happy. I don't
have any misery.

251
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,548
I know how happy you are.

252
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:54,549
I see you weeping all the while,
and hear your sobs...

253
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:59,057
I wonder why I don't die.

254
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,391
Father, never say such a thing
again. You are under oath to me.

255
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,062
Eat food and go to sleep.

256
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,401
You should eat first.

257
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,098
Sir, have you found
some new prey?

258
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,427
I've found one.
But a gun won't do.

259
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,438
- I would have to lay a trap.
- I didn't understand, sir.

260
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:50,111
She's so ravishing. Looks like she
has appeared on earth from heaven.

261
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:54,442
She's Neelu, the daughter of Rasila,
the man who rents out horses.

262
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,113
- But she's blind, sir.
- She's blind?

263
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,555
But I am not blind.

264
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:10,059
I've developed a liking
for her. Understand?

265
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,403
I can understand
even your hints.

266
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,071
- Can she be brought to the mansion?
- Yes, yes.

267
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,621
Who's she?

268
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,086
She's Neelu, a poor girl
from this locality.

269
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,089
What do you think
of the painting?

270
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,422
I didn't know that you are
such a good artist.

271
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:48,096
The eyes are so beautiful.
But they are lifeless.

272
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:52,102
And your eyes are very sharp.

273
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,277
You guessed it right.
This poor girl is blind.

274
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,280
What?

275
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:07,557
I had made a vow that after winning
the case against Pratap...

276
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,385
...I'll contribute 1000 rupees
at the Shiva temple.

277
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,229
Both of you may go tomorrow
and make the offering.

278
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,060
All right, mother. I will go.
But why does she have to come along?

279
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:20,566
- No, no...I will also come.
- Take her along too.

280
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,065
Rasila Uncle, be happy!

281
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,741
- What happened?
- Ready the horses.

282
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:29,408
I've brought passengers for you.
They want to go to the temple.

283
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,610
There they are!

284
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,249
- You want horses?
- Yes.

285
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,422
It'll cost you 10 rupees for
a return journey.

286
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,088
- All right.
- I'll get the horses.

287
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,425
You were right. She is
indeed very beautiful.

288
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,633
There are passengers.

289
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,549
She's the lady, and
he's the gentleman.

290
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,553
- Why this?
- Accept it, madam.

291
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,222
My daughter welcomes every first
customer of the day...

292
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,055
...by offering flowers.
Please accept it.

293
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,062
Give it to the gentleman too.

294
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,239
And this is for you.

295
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,077
- What's this?
- It's a 10-rupee note.

296
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40,079
- Father...?
- Take it, dear. It's a gift.

297
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,085
You have left me out, sir.

298
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,092
20...30...?

299
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,753
A rupee for you.

300
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,758
- Sir!
- Hey, you recognised me?

301
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,596
But you can't see?
How did you recognise him?

302
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,037
By hearing his voice.

303
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,707
Where did you hear his
voice earlier?

304
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,144
I had met her yesterday on the
banks of the lake.

305
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,780
I even painted a picture of her.

306
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,047
The painting was so beautiful that...

307
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:16,047
...I couldn't believe that a
girl could be so beautiful.

308
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,584
Your daughter is truly
very beautiful.

309
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:25,555
Yes...as beautiful as a flower
without any fragrance.

310
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:31,062
Let's leave now. I will go
and fetch the horses.

311
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,076
Since you got 10 rupees
as a gift today...

312
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:44,075
...accompany me to the fair and
buy many things of your liking.

313
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,622
How was the madam who was
accompanying the gentleman?

314
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:56,589
She looked like a princess!

315
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:01,529
But did you hear what I said?
I'll take you to the fair.

316
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,033
You will take this blind
girl to the fair?

317
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,038
Give the money to me. Or you won't
know if somebody steals it.

318
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,472
Why did you take the money?

319
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,539
Shall I tell you? You rascal!

320
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:24,720
There is so much work pending.
And you want to go to the fair?

321
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,393
Count it. There are
10 currency notes.

322
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:34,393
- So much money?
- This is only a token.

323
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,062
You will get whatever price
you ask for when the work is done.

324
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:41,066
Why are you lifting
so many utensils?

325
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:48,410
How pathetic your condition is!
Your hair too is not combed properly.

326
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,747
- Come with me, dear.
- Mother!

327
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:59,083
You know that I'm not happy
by marrying your father.

328
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:05,027
I've harassed you very much.
Please forgive me.

329
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,029
Don't say so, mother.

330
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,699
I will myself dress you
up like a bride today.

331
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:17,036
You will wear the bridal dress
which I wore in my marriage.

332
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,702
Your fortune is smiling
on you today, dear.

333
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:26,041
- I've finalised your marriage.
- Marriage? Who will marry me?

334
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:33,052
Why? You cannot see, that's all.
Otherwise you are so beautiful.

335
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:39,061
And the prospective bridegroom
is so educated and wealthy.

336
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,597
Does he know that I'm blind?

337
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,727
Yes. And he's prepared to
accept you heartily.

338
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,400
- Did you tell father?
- He will return only in the night.

339
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,609
I've to take you to the bridegroom's
family this evening itself.

340
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,408
- This evening itself?
- Yes.

341
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,081
Such opportunities don't
come very often.

342
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:09,019
When the boy comes, speak to him
respectfully. Understand?

343
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,034
You have gladdened
my boss so much!

344
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,031
Here...take it.

345
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,042
It's me, your future husband.

346
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:37,380
I am crazy about you ever since
I saw you bathing in the lake.

347
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,383
But I...

348
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,557
You can't see with your eyes.
Is that what you want to say?

349
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:52,602
This freshness...this simplicity.

350
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,072
Beautiful lips like petals.

351
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,571
- You've drunk liquor!
- Liquor?

352
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,180
It's not liquor.
It's nectar.

353
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,014
The holy offering of the
Gods and Goddesses.

354
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,554
You too had better drink it.

355
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,023
Both of us will come closer
after drinking it.

356
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,524
- Leave me!
- Don't break my heart, darling.

357
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,565
I don't want it.
Take me to my mother.

358
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,030
Mother? Your mother went away
after accepting the money.

359
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,570
- Money?
- Yes.

360
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:34,040
I've paid her 500 rupees.
You are mine for the night.

361
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,042
No! Mother can't do such a thing!

362
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,383
- Leave me.
- How can I leave you?

363
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,067
Help! Help!

364
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,332
- Help!
- What's that noise about?

365
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:06,338
Forget it, sir. One hears so many
screams in these valleys.

366
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,379
Help!

367
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,017
Help!

368
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:21,019
Rascal! Scoundrel!

369
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,030
Rascal! Scoundrel!
Shameless fellow!

370
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,573
Leave me!

371
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:45,047
For God's sake, don't touch me.
Have mercy on me. I beg of you.

372
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:57,059
Sir...please rescue me.

373
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,727
Sameer...leave her.

374
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,242
- Neelu!
- Father!

375
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,740
How could this happen?
How did you come here?

376
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:29,081
Mother dressed me up and made
a deal for me for 500 rupees.

377
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:34,590
If it had not been for him,
I would've lost my face.

378
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:42,424
Till today, that swine
played with my respect.

379
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,103
And I shielded her misbehaviour.

380
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:55,107
But today she tried to sell off
your modesty for money?

381
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,605
I will kill her today.

382
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:02,043
You've returned? I've been waiting
for your return since long.

383
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,053
Looks like you're very tired today.

384
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,382
Swine! Tell me, how much money did
you take for my daughter's modesty?

385
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,597
Come here, rascal!

386
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,600
Here...look at her
condition yourself.

387
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:22,570
If it had not been for the gentleman,
she would've surely lost her modesty.

388
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:27,409
If you've so much lust
for money, go and sell yourself.

389
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,077
- Father!
- Shut up, will you?

390
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:32,076
You sold off my daughter
for mere money?

391
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,084
To hell with such
ill-gotten wealth!

392
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:41,624
- Leave her, Rasila.
- I will kill her today!

393
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,625
Don't you dare touch me!

394
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:47,592
You scoundrel...rascal!
Get lost from here!

395
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,103
- Rasila...what happened?
- What's wrong?

396
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,602
What's happened to my father?

397
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,040
You take care of Rasila.
I'll go and fetch the doctor.

398
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,039
Father...what's happened
to my father?

399
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,056
- What's the matter?
- It's a heart attack.

400
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,226
That too a serious heart-attack.

401
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,390
I'm leaving.

402
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:32,068
Rasila...the doctor has said
that you'll recover completely.

403
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:37,576
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- I'm not afraid of even death.

404
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,516
But I'm anxious as to...

405
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:45,079
...what will happen of my blind
daughter after I'm gone.

406
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:53,096
One can console oneself if
a person is blind since birth.

407
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:58,095
But she had lost her
eyesight accidentally.

408
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,568
How did that happen?

409
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,034
She was run over by
a horse carriage.

410
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,040
Kulwant Rai was the landlord
of this region.

411
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,045
He was on his way
for hunting.

412
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,738
You didn't get her examined
by some good doctor?

413
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,566
I did.

414
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:44,075
The Rajasaheb paid for the
entire expenses.

415
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,076
He even paid 2000 rupees.

416
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,253
He was a very noble person.

417
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:59,095
But she was blinded for life.

418
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:07,567
Sir, your obligation on me
and my daughter today...

419
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:13,038
Don't mention it....take rest now.
I will return again tomorrow.

420
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,044
Thanks a lot.

421
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:34,397
I wonder why I'm remembering your
mother so much today.

422
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:44,069
When she was ailing, I used
to play rabaab for her.

423
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:49,577
She used to doze off
listening to my song.

424
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:54,082
- Remember, don't you?
- Yes, father.

425
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:01,014
After she passed away, I never
touched the musical instrument.

426
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:08,529
I wonder why I'm feeling
like listening to it again.

427
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,033
Go and fetch the rabaab, dear.

428
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:16,038
No, father. You're unwell.
You should take rest.

429
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,038
That's why I am saying...

430
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:27,044
You will sing, and I will go to
sleep peacefully listening to it.

431
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,719
All right, father.

432
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:27,077
Father!

433
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,411
Father!

434
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,085
Father!

435
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:03,551
Sir...do you know
what happened yesterday?

436
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,588
The water in the lake
caught fire!

437
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,154
And all the fishes
were burnt to death.

438
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,055
And the funny thing is...

439
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,067
The sun rose in the
night yesterday.

440
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,569
And it broke into pieces after
hitting that hill there.

441
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,078
Come to your senses, Neelu.

442
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:41,080
Sir, there won't be
any light now.

443
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:45,591
Don't weep, Neelu.
Nobody can change destiny.

444
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:54,099
Sir...who writes a person's destiny?

445
00:52:55,939 --> 00:53:01,536
First, I was deprived of my eyesight.
Now my father has been taken away.

446
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,205
I've no support in life.

447
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,547
I will support you.

448
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,381
- You, sir?
- Yes.

449
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:20,062
If you can trust me, then
come with me to my home.

450
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,399
I will take care of you.

451
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,062
Come on...

452
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,404
These 3,500 rupees have been received
from Mangal Singh and Dhanraj.

453
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,399
I have only spent 1500 out of it.

454
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:36,570
Mother...

455
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,615
- Who's this girl?
- Her name is Neelu.

456
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:46,583
She lives in the neighbourhood.
Her father passed away yesterday.

457
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:50,757
- Why have you brought her here?
- I want you to support her.

458
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,095
Sit here, Neelu.

459
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,192
I want to speak to you, Mother.

460
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,038
It's all right to sympathise
with poor people.

461
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:14,044
But how can an unknown girl
live in our home?

462
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,051
We can atone for one
of father's mistakes...

463
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,585
...by keeping Neelu
in our home.

464
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:24,055
- What do you mean?
- Neelu is a blind girl.

465
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,726
She had been run over by father's
horse-carriage many years ago.

466
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,059
I see. So she's that girl?

467
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:38,069
I've decided to take her to
some leading eye-specialist.

468
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,410
It's possible that she
might recover her eyesight.

469
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:45,576
Let her live here
till then, mother.

470
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:53,815
All right. If she recovers her
eyesight, her life will improve.

471
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:59,093
Forget it, sir. Here,
drink liquor now, sir.

472
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,191
No, I don't want to drink.

473
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:05,026
It has been 3 days since
you touched liquor.

474
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,735
How will you placate your grief?

475
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:12,040
My grief will be placated
only with Sameer's blood.

476
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,208
I am only waiting
for the opportunity.

477
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,047
Maya?

478
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:23,043
Whom were you waiting for?
For me?

479
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:29,720
- You?
- Yes...your Maya!

480
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:35,058
- Haria, go and make tea.
- Tea? For you?

481
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,061
No, for yourself.

482
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,066
Ah, yes...I will go make
and drink tea till then.

483
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,567
How did you get hurt?

484
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,072
Why have you come here all of a
sudden after all these days?

485
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:57,083
To find out whether you have a place
in your heart for me or not?

486
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,679
Looks like the Captain has
gone on a long flight.

487
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,359
Yes...a very long flight.

488
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:10,361
He will never return now.
His plane crashed.

489
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:15,031
Don't you see that I am not
wearing any marriage necklace?

490
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,041
I am a free woman now.

491
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,046
How strange are the
ways of life!

492
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,379
First I loved you. But your father
didn't let us get married...

493
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:37,054
...because I didn't have
my father's name with me.

494
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:42,558
Your father chose Balraj
considering his high family.

495
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,067
Now your father and Balraj
are both dead.

496
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:52,403
And just Maya remains...
...your Maya!

497
00:56:56,846 --> 00:57:00,680
I was a wealthy person earlier.
But I am a debtor today.

498
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:05,519
So I don't want you to lead
a troubled life by marrying me.

499
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:12,351
We can live comfortably at least
for some days in 1 lakh rupees.

500
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,563
What do you mean?

501
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:20,030
I will be getting a lakh of rupees
from Balraj's insurance.

502
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:24,038
- When?
- In a month's time.

503
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:31,041
I always loved you sincerely.
I love you even now.

504
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:36,051
But I don't want to cheat you.
So I told you my problem clearly.

505
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,053
Forget about money.

506
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:45,557
I just want your love...your
company...will you give it to me?

507
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,396
Till my last breath.

508
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,137
Do you know why I've
brought you here?

509
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,674
Because if you hadn't come here,
the sun would've waited for you...

510
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,545
...and the fishes would
have remained hungry.

511
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,181
You remember it still?

512
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:13,017
I can never forget that day
when I saw you the first time.

513
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:20,023
- Take this, Neelu.
- What is it?

514
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:25,032
- Food for your fishes.
- The fishes will pray for you.

515
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:31,038
Ask these fishes to pray
for only one thing.

516
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,576
Tomorrow is an exhibition
of my paintings.

517
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:40,047
That I get a lot of good name and
people like my skills very much.

518
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,584
They will like your paintings
very much.

519
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:48,383
Your renown will spread far and
wide, like the rays of the sun.

520
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:51,384
Have the fishes prayed for
me to such an extent?

521
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:57,065
Alongwith the fishes, a blind and
helpless girl too has prayed for you.

522
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,664
- You are leaving tomorrow?
- Yes...only for two days.

523
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,366
But don't worry. I will ask Jugnu
to take care of you.

524
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:12,339
- Feed the fishes yourself today.
- Why?

525
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,348
They will eagerly await
for your return.

526
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,525
You are India's greatest
art critic of the present times.

527
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,362
Please tell me something
about my paintings.

528
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,564
What should I advise you about it?

529
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,026
In my opinion, a case of cheating
should be lodged against you.

530
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:38,369
Because you've cheated art lovers
by not showing it to anybody.

531
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:44,545
Where were you all along?
Your work has an individual style.

532
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:48,045
- There's originality...
- And there's life too.

533
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,047
I'm leaving, Sameer.

534
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,388
- Can I speak to you for a while?
- Yes?

535
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,719
I want this painting.

536
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,597
Perhaps you didn't read...
'Not for sale'.

537
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:07,565
I read it. But when one is
determined to acquire something...

538
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,401
...then he does whatever that needs
to be done...beg, borrow or steal.

539
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:15,076
I'll pay you whatever price you
ask for. But I want this painting.

540
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:18,246
Looks like you have fallen
in love with this painting.

541
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:22,245
No, my profession is such that I
don't get any time for romancing.

542
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,255
This girl's eyes have
attracted me.

543
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,423
I've seen dreams of vision
in these eyes.

544
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,096
How did you get to know that
this girl cannot see?

545
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,098
Because I am eye-specialist.

546
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,596
- Your name?
- I'm known as Dr. Tandon.

547
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,105
- Dr. J.P. Tandon?
- Yes.

548
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,607
You're India's leading
eye-specialist.

549
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:51,104
I hope the eyes can be treated if the
person is not blind since birth.

550
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:55,109
One can be sure only after
examining the eyes.

551
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,618
This girl is an orphan.

552
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,553
She lost her eyes during her
childhood in an accident.

553
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:04,384
You just said that you have seen
dreams of vision in her eyes.

554
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,228
With your grace, if she
is able to see...

555
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,064
...then I will never forget
your obligation all my life.

556
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:15,066
From what you say, it seems as if
you have fallen in love with her.

557
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,236
You may assume whatever you wish.

558
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,744
Here...take it.

559
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,081
- What's the price?
- You don't have to pay anything.

560
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,544
You mean...you are bribing me?

561
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:33,085
No. A gift from one
artist to another.

562
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,682
I'm not an artist.
I'm merely a doctor.

563
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,252
Every human being is an
artist in his own way.

564
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:44,098
My art could only make a painting
of these lifeless, beautiful eyes.

565
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,601
It's possible that you might put
life in these lifeless eyes.

566
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,105
I'll try my best. Bring her
to my hospital on Monday.

567
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,103
- As for the painting...
- No.

568
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,608
She's your patient now. And the
painting too belongs to you.

569
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,719
You've been pricked by
the thorn, aren't you?

570
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:17,399
Haven't I asked you to call out for
me whenever you need me?

571
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,061
Birbal, which colour
is this flower?

572
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,237
It's pink in colour.

573
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,602
Pink is the colour of
happiness, isn't it?

574
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:29,607
- It indeed is.
- Will you pluck a flower for me?

575
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:34,249
Why not? Here...

576
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:39,086
Gosh! Kunwar has come.
I had better slip away.

577
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,592
There's very good news for you.

578
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,090
I'm taking you to a leading
eye-specialist tomorrow morning.

579
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,428
God willing, your eyesight
will be restored completely.

580
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,436
May you live long.

581
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,704
- What's this?
- A gift from a poor girl.

582
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:04,040
It's your birthday today,
isn't it?

583
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,213
How did you know that
it's my birthday today?

584
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,546
I can't see.
But I can surely hear.

585
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:16,053
My birthday arrives every year.
I get many expensive gifts.

586
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:21,061
But nobody ever gave me such a
beautiful and lovely gift.

587
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,060
I will never let it wither.

588
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,726
How will you do that?

589
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:29,068
I will make a painting
of this flower.

590
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:33,566
There's a party this evening. I want
to introduce you to my friends.

591
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,568
All right.

592
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,416
Many happy returns of
the day, Mr. Sameer.

593
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,255
- Who called him here?
- Nobody.

594
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:54,592
When we met the last time,
I had made a big mistake.

595
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,298
I've come to ask for
forgiveness today.

596
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,528
A person cannot change
so quickly.

597
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,037
Why not? If he realises
his mistake...

598
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,041
...the worst person can
change for the better.

599
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:11,038
You too? I am unable
to believe that...

600
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:19,049
Forget the past, and extend
your hand of friendship.

601
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:26,386
Since you've already come
to my home, you're welcome.

602
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,062
Queen Mother!

603
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,069
- My greetings to you!
- How come you are here?

604
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:41,071
Since it is Sameer's birthday,
I thought of asking you for pardon.

605
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,581
You didn't like my coming here?

606
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:56,086
I'm wondering how you've come to
congratulate your enemy.

607
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,523
I've decided to change
myself with the times.

608
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,031
If you had thought
about it earlier...

609
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,030
...there wouldn't have been
the wall of hatred today.

610
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,569
If this wall hadn't been there...

611
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,533
...what would have happened
of your authority?

612
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,041
Don't lose your cool.

613
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,541
Tell me....to what extent have
you succeeded in your motives?

614
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:19,573
What motives?

615
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:23,046
Your plans of making your daughter
the daughter-in-law of this family.

616
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,380
- How does it concern you?
- I asked it out of sympathy.

617
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:33,390
Just like you had become an
obstacle between us brothers...

618
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:37,393
...I hear that a blind girl's become
an obstacle in your motives.

619
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,396
No nonsense!

620
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,076
Who is she, Mr. Sameer?

621
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,026
She appears to be a
mobile cartoon.

622
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,529
She appears to be a mad girl,
not a cartoon.

623
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,534
I think that she is coming here
straight from some zoo.

624
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,572
Have you invited this model
to amuse the guests?

625
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:27,407
Have you gone mad, Neelu?

626
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,216
What's this get-up?

627
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:34,048
Get-up? But Jugnu has herself
dressed me up with her own hands.

628
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,056
She was saying that I look
very beautiful.

629
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,063
I had thought of introducing
you to my guests.

630
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,061
And then I will ask you to sing
a song on my birthday.

631
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:52,067
Go to your room, Neelu.
These people are laughing at you.

632
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:56,072
So what? People laugh at
blind and helpless people.

633
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,280
You've come to this home
because of me.

634
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:04,013
These people are laughing at you,
while I've to face embarrassment.

635
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:07,187
- Go, Neelu.
- No, Mr. Sameer.

636
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,190
You will never have to face
embarrassment because of me.

637
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:19,034
Go to your guests.
I will do whatever you wish.

638
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:32,082
Here, Maya. By when will you
get the insurance money?

639
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,080
Within this month.

640
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:39,156
Who would've known that Balraj
would die so suddenly?

641
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:48,102
Whenever you need any help from me,
don't hesitate to call me.

642
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:02,041
- What's your name?
- Neelu.

643
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:07,046
Do you know...I see
you every morning?

644
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:10,223
- What?
- I'm referring to your painting.

645
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,561
He's the doctor who took
away your painting from me.

646
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,062
Take her inside.

647
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,606
I should be leaving.

648
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,407
- She's Maya, my sister-in-law.
- Greetings.

649
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:33,079
And he's Mr. Sameer,
an exceptional painter.

650
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,249
This painting has been
drawn by him.

651
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:39,082
- The girl who just went...
- She's the one. She's blind.

652
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,418
All right, then.

653
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,624
She became a widow
at such a young age.

654
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:49,592
- She's a widow?
- Yes.

655
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,599
This is the photograph of
Balraj, my paternal cousin.

656
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,101
He was a pilot, married
to Maya two years ago.

657
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,365
And he died suddenly
in a plane crash.

658
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:07,043
Be it a doctor, medicines
or wealth...

659
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:09,383
...nobody has any say
in matters of death.

660
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,120
Wait here. I will
examine Neelu.

661
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,580
Do you know whom I met
at the doctor's dispensary?

662
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:45,744
- Who did you meet?
- Your Sameer.

663
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,088
He brought along a blind
girl named Neelu.

664
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,424
- Neelu?
- Yes.

665
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:54,094
- Be seated.
- All right.

666
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:04,370
- Sameer...it's very regrettable.
- What?

667
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,041
She should have been referred
to some specialist...

668
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,369
...when she had met
with an accident.

669
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,545
She had to remain blind
all along unnecessarily.

670
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:14,047
- You mean...
- I mean that...

671
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:17,046
...if you had referred then,
an operation would've been easier.

672
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,048
It's a bit difficult now.

673
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:22,051
- I hope Neelu's eyes can be treated.
- That can be done.

674
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,226
An operation will have
to be done.

675
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:30,062
I'll finalise the date of
operation and inform you.

676
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:33,597
- What about your examination fees?
- That won't be necessary.

677
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,236
But there will be a lot of
expenditure for the operation.

678
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:40,737
Don't worry about money.
I will pay whatever the fees.

679
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:46,572
If you can pay, then after
her eyes are treated...

680
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,412
...donate whatever amount you
like to the hospital.

681
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:54,087
Why later? I will send a cheque
for 25,000 today itself.

682
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:03,696
You will be able to see everything
within a month's time.

683
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:05,531
Thank you.

684
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,701
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

685
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:17,040
When your eyes are treated,
whom would you like to see first?

686
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,706
Please tell me.

687
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:24,709
I would like to see you.

688
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,585
Me?

689
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,051
If a blind person gets eyes...

690
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,588
...the person would like to
see her God the first thing.

691
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,053
You are my God.

692
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:37,597
How can you say that?

693
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,063
I told you what I felt.

694
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:49,242
I too want to tell you something.

695
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,081
I want to make you mine
for always.

696
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,418
What?

697
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:04,186
Yes. I can't live
without you now.

698
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:54,647
Why have you become quiet?

699
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:03,055
I had been lost. I was seeing
my dreams becoming a reality.

700
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,558
Let's go home.

701
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:18,063
- Don't make any sound.
- Balraj?

702
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,070
You are alive?

703
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:24,411
Yes, I am alive.
But don't worry.

704
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,280
I won't snatch your
friend away from you.

705
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,275
He appears to be your old lover.

706
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,086
But hadn't your plane crashed?

707
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:35,084
That was in the eyes of the world.

708
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:36,415
It means you...

709
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:40,092
I am dead in the eyes
of the world.

710
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,426
- And for you too.
- Then why have you come back?

711
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:47,096
To collect the one lakh rupees
of my insurance money.

712
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,764
That too with your help...that
is, with my wife's help.

713
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:56,109
What if I refuse?

714
01:21:56,912 --> 01:22:02,043
Then I will file an
adultery case on you.

715
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:11,054
An illicit relationship with another
despite your husband being alive.

716
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:21,064
But you're already dead, darling. How
can a dead person testify in court?

717
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,061
You are right.

718
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:27,573
A dead man cannot
murder anybody.

719
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,403
And your murder will
remain a mystery.

720
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:37,079
No, no. Move away the knife.
I will do as you say.

721
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,582
You will get the insurance
money in 15-20 days.

722
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,752
Give it to me straightaway.
Understand?

723
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,094
I'm coming, Pratap. I wasn't
finding the brandy.

724
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:59,100
What's the matter, Neelu?
You are very happy today!

725
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:03,039
Yes, Jugnu. Know what
the doctor has said?

726
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:06,572
The doctor has said that I will
be able to see everything.

727
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:15,055
I will be able to see the Queen
mother, you, and...everybody.

728
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,556
Why are you quiet?
Have you left?

729
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,560
No. I am listening
and thinking.

730
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,567
- What are you thinking?
- How naive you are!

731
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:33,239
Who knows? The light of your eyes
may cause darkness in someone's life.

732
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,426
The operation has been completed.
Everything has turned out well.

733
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:13,712
I hear Neelu's eye-operation
has been successful.

734
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:22,385
After her bandage is removed, you
will lose Sameer for good.

735
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:29,626
I am make Neelu vanish from
Sameer's life in a jiffy.

736
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:32,397
How can you do that?

737
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,416
Your forehead is
absolutely cold.

738
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:01,025
Only I know what
I am experiencing.

739
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:06,032
My entire body is burning.

740
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:08,234
- I will telephone the doctor.
- No.

741
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,570
The doctor can only treat.

742
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,567
It's not hisjob
to extinguish a fire.

743
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:13,705
Fire?

744
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:17,038
Have you ever seen anybody
who's stung by a scorpio?

745
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:18,710
Have you been stung
by a scorpion?

746
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:24,380
Yes. When a scorpion stings,
nothing is apparent from outside...

747
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,253
...but trembling
continues within.

748
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:33,389
Just like a person who is
breathing, but needs oxygen.

749
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:35,822
What are you talking?

750
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,062
What's happened to you?

751
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,062
I've been stung by a scorpion.

752
01:30:10,171 --> 01:30:12,571
Why this body exposure
and shamelessness?

753
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:15,401
You have begun to love
that blind girl.

754
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:20,078
What does she have
that I don't?

755
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:25,084
I've seen your true face today.

756
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:30,082
However Neelu is, she can
never be like you.

757
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:34,092
And you will have to be reborn
10 times to become like Neelu.

758
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,170
You haven't slept yet?

759
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:48,170
Queen Mother...take back
this necklace.

760
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:53,178
- Why?
- It doesn't befit me now.

761
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,512
- Give it to Neelu now.
- To Neelu?

762
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:01,119
- Yes. Sameer loves her.
- How can you say that?

763
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:06,120
I told you what Sameer told me.

764
01:31:07,228 --> 01:31:10,129
I see...I suspected it all along.

765
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:14,632
But I hadn't imagined that
it would reach such a stage.

766
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:19,133
Don't worry, Jugnu.
I'm still around.

767
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:23,642
When the bandage from my eyes
is removed...

768
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:26,145
...I want to see you
the first thing.

769
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:28,642
Really, Neelu?

770
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:32,147
Take rest now.
I will come later.

771
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,831
Who is it? Queen Mother?

772
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:53,169
Yes. I am glad to hear that
your eyes will be treated.

773
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:57,169
Yes, with your blessings.
Please be seated.

774
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:04,111
You will no longer
be a handicap now.

775
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:12,121
I'm glad that you will be able to
see Sameer's marriage with your eyes.

776
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,658
What?

777
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:17,454
Sameer had taken the responsibility
for your treatment.

778
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,299
So I couldn't fix the date.

779
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:26,806
I'd taken the decision to make Jugnu
my daughter-in-law a long time ago.

780
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:33,138
What's the matter? Why did
you turn your face away?

781
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:35,806
Nothing, Queen Mother.

782
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:43,153
I know that you have considered
Sameer's sympathy to be love.

783
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:44,355
Queen Mother!

784
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,520
You were dreaming of
marrying my son.

785
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:52,331
Neelu, you didn't wonder why...

786
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:57,162
...Sameer helped an illiterate,
handicapped girl like you.

787
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:03,103
That's because many years ago,
you had lost your eyes...

788
01:33:03,377 --> 01:33:06,778
...after being run over by the
horse-carriage of Sameer's father.

789
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:11,443
Sameer has got your eyes
treated so that...

790
01:33:12,386 --> 01:33:15,116
...he could atone for
his father's mistake.

791
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,121
No!

792
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:21,623
I hope that you will leave
Sameer's life for good...

793
01:33:22,396 --> 01:33:27,459
...once your eyes are treated.

794
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:40,313
The Diwan, Jugnu, Sameer and the
Queen Mother...everybody is here.

795
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:50,155
Neelu...open your eyes slowly.

796
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:52,483
Slowly...

797
01:33:56,697 --> 01:33:57,664
Bravo!

798
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:22,619
Who knows? The light of your eyes
may cause darkness in someone's life.

799
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:30,123
I hope that you will leave
Sameer's life for good...

800
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,127
...once your eyes are treated.

801
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:36,468
I want to make you mine
for always.

802
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:40,139
I hope that you will leave
Sameer's life for good...

803
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:42,308
...once your eyes are treated.

804
01:34:46,414 --> 01:34:48,143
No...no!

805
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:52,477
I can't see anything.

806
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:58,823
What're you saying? It cannot be.
Look at me. Can't you see me?

807
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:06,098
No, I can't see a thing.
I have become blind.

808
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:09,635
I have full faith
on my operation.

809
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:16,608
You are not at fault, doctor.

810
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:22,110
What can you do if a person
is destined for darkness?

811
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,116
But, Neelu...

812
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,288
Please go outside for a while.

813
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,624
Sameer, please go out.

814
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:35,627
That's very bad. If her
eyes had been treated...

815
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:38,130
Who can change one's destiny?

816
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,462
Come, dear.

817
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:44,466
No, mother. You proceed.
I will come later.

818
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:48,134
All right. Come, dear.

819
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:03,083
Those people supported me,
got my eyes treated...

820
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:06,758
...I can never repay
their obligations.

821
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:11,598
But I can go far away
from Mr. Sameer's life...

822
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:17,099
...so that he can marry Jugnu and
the Queen Mother's wish is fulfilled.

823
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,096
I cannot say about others.

824
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:25,106
Butjust imagine how disappointed
Sameer would feel...

825
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,610
...if you continue to remain
blind despite having eyesight.

826
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:32,284
I know. That's why I want to
go far away from his life.

827
01:36:33,487 --> 01:36:34,454
Where?

828
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:39,124
Far away...very far away...where
he could never meet me.

829
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:44,126
It means you don't love Sameer.

830
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:48,292
To love doesn't mean to get.

831
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:53,129
Promise me that you will never
tell anybody that I can see.

832
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:55,469
Not even to Mr. Sameer.

833
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:58,143
How can you speak like this?
It's impossible.

834
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:01,407
Being a doctor, it's my duty
to tell people that...

835
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:03,081
...you were blind
since childhood...

836
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:04,215
...and that you've recovered
your eyesight now.

837
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:06,419
People's faith in me
will increase...

838
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:08,587
...and more blind and helpless
people will benefit.

839
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:11,256
Just do me one favour.

840
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:16,088
Till I don't go away from here
and from Sameer's life...

841
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:18,592
...don't not tell anybody that
I can see.

842
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:23,598
Otherwise people will think that
I've ruined that family.

843
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:30,636
I beg of you, doctor.
Promise me, doctor.

844
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:34,313
Weeping is not good for your
eyes for the time being.

845
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:38,317
Go and take rest...come on.

846
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:49,119
It's very regrettable, Sameer.

847
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:53,628
It's my first operation which hasn't
succeeded despite being successful.

848
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:57,461
You mean Neelu's eyes
will never be treated?

849
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:02,066
I cannot do anything else, nor
can I say anything in this regard.

850
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,113
I've given her sleeping pills.
She has gone to sleep.

851
01:38:09,183 --> 01:38:11,083
- Meet her in the morning.
- Doctor, I will...

852
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:17,085
All right. I will come
tomorrow morning.

853
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,108
- Where's the patient?
- She has left.

854
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:42,611
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

855
01:38:44,218 --> 01:38:45,446
The doctor allowed her to leave.

856
01:38:45,686 --> 01:38:47,415
- Where's Neelu?
- I don't know.

857
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:49,613
She insisted on going away.

858
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:54,456
But you knew that I will
be coming today!

859
01:38:57,398 --> 01:38:59,298
- When did she leave?
- Just a while ago.

860
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:24,086
Why did you leave the hospital?
You didn't even wait for me.

861
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:28,089
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

862
01:39:29,396 --> 01:39:31,421
I don't want to be a burden
on you any longer.

863
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:35,426
Because your eyes cannot
be treated now?

864
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:41,102
No, you underwent lot of
hardships because of me.

865
01:39:42,376 --> 01:39:46,608
If I remain with you, the darkness
of my eyes will deprive you...

866
01:39:47,548 --> 01:39:51,609
...of your destiny's brightness.
Let me go, Mr. Sameer.

867
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:56,456
- Where will you go?
- Anywhere.

868
01:39:57,725 --> 01:40:02,128
The world is very big. I will
get some support or the other.

869
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:07,794
I beg of you.
Forget me for good.

870
01:40:12,406 --> 01:40:16,638
Can you forget me? Tell me.
Answer me.

871
01:40:18,912 --> 01:40:22,143
Do you know when I will
forget you?

872
01:40:23,784 --> 01:40:25,479
The day I die.

873
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,488
Never say such a thing again.

874
01:40:31,425 --> 01:40:35,156
If I could've my way, I would
have given you my eyes.

875
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:42,667
I will support you all your life
as if I were your eyes.

876
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:47,706
I will never let you feel
that you cannot see.

877
01:40:50,444 --> 01:40:53,675
Come home, Neelu.

878
01:40:59,353 --> 01:41:01,116
That girl cannot live
in this home now.

879
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:03,319
Why?

880
01:41:03,524 --> 01:41:07,483
Because I don't want her to become
an obstacle between you and Jugnu.

881
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:10,124
I have given my word
to the Diwan...

882
01:41:10,397 --> 01:41:13,127
...and have decided to make
Jugnu my daughter-in-law.

883
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:16,130
- This is not possible.
- Why?

884
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:20,798
Because I love Neelu.

885
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:23,805
I wanted to hear you
speaking this.

886
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:29,141
It's sad that the blind girl
has made you blind too.

887
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:36,820
That girl wants to trap you
and acquire our wealth.

888
01:41:38,358 --> 01:41:42,488
No, mother. Nobody knows
Neelu better than I do.

889
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:46,897
There's a huge difference between
my Neelu and your Jugnu.

890
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:49,698
So this is your final decision?

891
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:52,171
Yes, mother.

892
01:41:52,773 --> 01:42:01,613
All right. If you love her so much,
I won't stop you.

893
01:42:03,717 --> 01:42:08,450
You are my only son....I take an oath
in your name and say this...

894
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:13,715
Neelu will be married to you
only after I am dead.

895
01:42:24,771 --> 01:42:26,136
Queen Mother...

896
01:42:28,775 --> 01:42:31,300
- Queen Mother!
- Why did you come here again?

897
01:42:33,747 --> 01:42:37,148
Believe me...I didn't come
here on my own.

898
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:40,476
I had left the hospital without
informing Mr. Sameer.

899
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:43,655
But he found me and
brought me back.

900
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:47,325
Did he bring you forcefully?

901
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:51,498
- No.
- Couldn't you have refused?

902
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:56,165
Do you love Sameer very much?

903
01:42:57,604 --> 01:43:00,095
- I worship him.
- From your heart?

904
01:43:01,942 --> 01:43:03,432
Yes, Queen Mother.

905
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:09,615
Then go away for good from
his life and this home.

906
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:12,782
It will be in his interest.

907
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,120
I can even give up my
life for his interest.

908
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:19,624
But my going away from
here will be of no use.

909
01:43:20,761 --> 01:43:27,132
He will search for me again.
Still, if you want...

910
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:31,633
Somehow or the other,
make him hate you.

911
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:35,136
In return, I'll give
you whatever you ask for.

912
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:42,645
What can you give me? You are
yourself asking me for something.

913
01:43:44,251 --> 01:43:51,157
I can never repay whatever you
people have done for me.

914
01:43:53,260 --> 01:44:01,429
I promise...I will go away
from his life for good.

915
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:05,430
Just give me an opportunity
to think...

916
01:44:06,873 --> 01:44:13,108
One whom I worship, how should
I make him hate me?

917
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:22,618
- Who? Jugnu?
- Yes.

918
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:26,120
If you want to fulfill your
promise to the Queen Mother...

919
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:31,629
...you don't have to make anyone
begin to hate you.

920
01:44:32,566 --> 01:44:35,797
Just one little lie
will do the trick.

921
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:38,132
- A lie?
- Yes.

922
01:44:38,405 --> 01:44:42,136
Tell Sameer that you have
been married long time ago.

923
01:44:43,577 --> 01:44:44,475
What?

924
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:50,478
- Will he believe me?
- He will be made to believe.

925
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:54,649
But tell me...will you
be able to lie?

926
01:44:55,322 --> 01:44:57,483
I've already told
Queen Mother that...

927
01:44:58,925 --> 01:45:01,086
...I can even sacrifice
my life for Mr. Sameer.

928
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:05,089
Try me out if you
aren't convinced.

929
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:58,683
- Who is it?
- It's me...Jugnu.

930
01:45:59,419 --> 01:46:02,252
I was experiencing a headache. So
I came to take the balm bottle.

931
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:06,087
I heard a noise. So I thought
some thief has entered the home.

932
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:10,091
Nothing of the sort. Go to sleep.
It's very late in the night.

933
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,106
You've come?

934
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:27,608
Remove your mother's bangles.

935
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:29,439
I brought the entire
jewellery box in a hurry.

936
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:31,115
Now that you have brought it,
give it to me.

937
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:34,115
The cost of all thisjewellery is
nothing in comparison to the work...

938
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:37,118
...which I will do for you
tomorrow morning. Understand?

939
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:43,526
He's come to meet you.

940
01:46:43,764 --> 01:46:45,459
How are you?

941
01:46:45,732 --> 01:46:51,136
My servant has come here
to take along his wife from here.

942
01:46:52,272 --> 01:46:55,139
Wife? His wife here
in our house?

943
01:46:56,243 --> 01:46:59,679
Thank God you saved her
by providing her support.

944
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:03,581
Otherwise where would that blind,
handicapped girl have gone?

945
01:47:03,917 --> 01:47:07,409
- Fetch Neelu. Then we will leave.
- Wait!

946
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:14,421
You're playing some new trick to
take Neelu away from here?

947
01:47:15,395 --> 01:47:18,592
Kid...have you forgotten
the bashing that day?

948
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:26,100
I didn't know then that
Neelu is Haria's wife.

949
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:30,106
It's a lie.
Neelu isn't Haria's wife.

950
01:47:30,544 --> 01:47:32,444
What's the matter?

951
01:47:32,879 --> 01:47:38,442
Before marriage, Neelu's parents hid
the fact from me that she's blind.

952
01:47:39,219 --> 01:47:41,119
When I got to know that
she's blind...

953
01:47:41,388 --> 01:47:43,618
...I got enraged and threw
her out of the house.

954
01:47:44,224 --> 01:47:46,124
Liar! I will smash your head.

955
01:47:46,426 --> 01:47:49,122
Leave him. Let me hear
what he has to say.

956
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:52,630
- Neelu is your wife?
- Yes.

957
01:47:53,567 --> 01:47:57,128
When Mr. Pratap got to know last
night, he got furious on me.

958
01:47:57,404 --> 01:48:05,072
He admonished me saying that
I am a sinner.

959
01:48:06,346 --> 01:48:08,576
It's nonsense. Neelu
is not his wife.

960
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:11,577
You are unnecessarily interfering
in a couple's dispute.

961
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:14,411
There comes Neelu. The
truth will be known now.

962
01:48:19,826 --> 01:48:21,623
Haria says that you
are his wife.

963
01:48:21,862 --> 01:48:23,762
Tell them that he's lying
and that it's a lie.

964
01:48:32,706 --> 01:48:34,606
Yesterday you had said, didn't
you, that you are married?

965
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:37,275
Why don't you speak?
Why are you quiet?

966
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:44,109
Yes, Mr. Sameer.
Haria is my husband.

967
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:51,122
Do you realise
what you are saying?

968
01:48:51,758 --> 01:48:56,127
It's true. He's my husband.

969
01:48:57,564 --> 01:49:02,399
Neelu, forgive me for all the
troubles that I gave you.

970
01:49:07,173 --> 01:49:11,576
I couldn't have imagined that
you would betray me like this.

971
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:17,081
- Let's go home, Neelu.
- Wait.

972
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:21,582
- Diwanji, do you have some money?
- Yes...how much money do you need?

973
01:49:22,455 --> 01:49:24,252
Give me all of it.

974
01:49:24,858 --> 01:49:26,416
Take it, Neelu.
You might need it.

975
01:49:26,693 --> 01:49:29,594
She might lose the money.
I will keep it with me.

976
01:49:30,363 --> 01:49:32,263
Seek the blessings of
the Queen Mother.

977
01:49:34,868 --> 01:49:36,768
Bless you, dear.

978
01:49:38,705 --> 01:49:41,105
Your keys, Queen Mother.

979
01:49:43,209 --> 01:49:45,609
These are keys to the safe.
Where did you get them?

980
01:49:46,713 --> 01:49:50,615
I was going to my room in the night.
It struck against my legs.

981
01:49:52,218 --> 01:49:54,118
Let's go, Neelu.

982
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:02,785
Where are you going?

983
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:06,460
I don't know. Anywhere.
But far away from here.

984
01:50:06,733 --> 01:50:09,133
- Have you gone mad?
- It would have better...

985
01:50:09,402 --> 01:50:11,131
...if I had gone mad.

986
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:16,800
A girl who cheated you all the while
despite being married...forget her.

987
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:20,641
I cannot forget her
in this lifetime.

988
01:50:21,414 --> 01:50:25,475
You are running after a piece of
glass and neglecting a diamond.

989
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:34,158
No other girl can take Neelu's
place in my life.

990
01:50:36,262 --> 01:50:38,662
- Stop him, Diwanji.
- Calm down, Queen Mother.

991
01:50:39,432 --> 01:50:43,163
Let him go. When his temper
cools down, he will return.

992
01:50:44,938 --> 01:50:46,838
Keep these important documents
in the locker.

993
01:50:48,575 --> 01:50:51,510
Don't worry, dear. God willing,
everything will be fine.

994
01:50:57,684 --> 01:50:59,379
- What happened, Queen Mother?
- It's shocking.

995
01:50:59,619 --> 01:51:03,111
The jewellery box has disappeared.
It contained all my jewellery.

996
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:08,626
Neelu gave you the keys. She has
gone with Haria and Pratap.

997
01:51:08,895 --> 01:51:11,625
It means that the three of
them are hands-in-glove.

998
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:15,129
Pratap did finally manage
to avenge the enmity.

999
01:51:15,568 --> 01:51:20,130
- What should we do now?
- I'll inform the police.

1000
01:51:28,048 --> 01:51:29,811
Inspector, the jewellery box
containing ornaments...

1001
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:31,683
...worth at least
5 lakhs are missing.

1002
01:51:31,918 --> 01:51:34,148
Yes, I've searched the entire house.

1003
01:51:36,256 --> 01:51:38,156
Please come here as soon as...

1004
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:40,154
What's this?

1005
01:51:40,427 --> 01:51:44,329
Don't call the police. Or else
your daughter will be jailed.

1006
01:51:44,798 --> 01:51:47,164
- What?
- I have stolen the jewels.

1007
01:51:48,935 --> 01:51:52,666
Yes, daddy. I became
blinded in love...

1008
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,340
...when Sameer fell in love
with the blind Neelu.

1009
01:51:56,009 --> 01:51:59,172
Suddenly, I met Pratap
who promised me that...

1010
01:51:59,813 --> 01:52:01,644
...if I give him
the jewellery box...

1011
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:05,609
...he would distance Neelu
from Sameer's life for good.

1012
01:52:06,753 --> 01:52:09,119
No, I don't believe it.

1013
01:52:10,423 --> 01:52:13,119
I've earned my livelihood from this
house for 30 long years...

1014
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:16,123
...and I never let my
honesty be affected...

1015
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:19,455
...his own daughter drooped to such
a level for selfish gains.

1016
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:21,461
Shut up!

1017
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:32,144
Because of you, I cannot even see
the Queen Mother eye-to-eye.

1018
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:39,147
Because of you, I considered that
girl to be a thief.

1019
01:52:39,786 --> 01:52:41,686
- Forgive me.
- Never.

1020
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:47,492
I can sacrifice my daughter,
but not my duty.

1021
01:52:48,928 --> 01:52:50,828
I will myself hand you over
to the police.

1022
01:52:52,265 --> 01:52:54,165
It's no use trying to
extinguish the fire...

1023
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,163
...after the house
has been burnt down.

1024
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:00,769
I've overheard everything.

1025
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:04,606
Whatever Jugnu has done,
she didn't do the right thing.

1026
01:53:05,378 --> 01:53:07,437
But she has got her
punishment for that.

1027
01:53:08,581 --> 01:53:12,108
The person for whom she committed
the theft, she has lost him too.

1028
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:17,116
Like Jugnu, I too committed
the same mistake.

1029
01:53:18,525 --> 01:53:20,618
I tried to distance
Neelu from Sameer.

1030
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:24,623
A mother couldn't recognise
the feelings of a son.

1031
01:53:27,233 --> 01:53:29,133
Stop the vehicle.
I will get down here.

1032
01:53:29,435 --> 01:53:33,132
- Where will you go?
- Wherever destiny takes me.

1033
01:53:33,406 --> 01:53:39,641
Haria is your destiny. After all,
you've considered him your husband.

1034
01:53:40,246 --> 01:53:46,515
How can I even smell a bud on
which you've set your eyes upon?

1035
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:53,154
I've got what I wanted.
Now she is only yours.

1036
01:53:54,594 --> 01:53:57,154
- Stop the vehicle.
- Hey! What're you doing?

1037
01:53:58,932 --> 01:54:03,096
- I beg of you, let me go.
- How can I let you go?

1038
01:54:03,736 --> 01:54:06,102
- Stop the vehicle.
- I will bash you up.

1039
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:16,615
Hey! What happened?
She has become unconscious.

1040
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:28,785
You? Here?

1041
01:54:29,028 --> 01:54:31,121
I've tracked you down with
great difficulty...

1042
01:54:32,232 --> 01:54:34,132
...after having searched
every hotel.

1043
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,300
Since when have you
started drinking?

1044
01:54:37,237 --> 01:54:39,296
Ever since this venomous
woman has stung me.

1045
01:54:39,572 --> 01:54:44,134
No, Neelu is innocent.
I'm the real culprit.

1046
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:47,278
- What are you saying?
- Neelu is not married.

1047
01:54:49,249 --> 01:54:50,147
What?

1048
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:53,477
On my insistence, she lied
that she is Haria's wife.

1049
01:54:55,455 --> 01:54:59,653
To remove Neelu from my path,
I got taken in by Pratap...

1050
01:54:59,926 --> 01:55:01,757
...and stole the Queen
Mother'sjewellery for him.

1051
01:55:02,362 --> 01:55:04,262
Neelu was distanced from you
because of me.

1052
01:55:04,864 --> 01:55:08,766
You had to leave your home
because of me. Forgive me.

1053
01:55:09,502 --> 01:55:14,098
You shameless girl...you handed over
that helpless girl to those jackals.

1054
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:19,102
Because of you, I suspected
Neelu's love for me.

1055
01:55:19,946 --> 01:55:23,109
I won't spare you alive.

1056
01:55:23,383 --> 01:55:25,317
Come to your senses, Sameer.

1057
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,120
More than her, your
mother is to blame...

1058
01:55:29,489 --> 01:55:32,117
...who had ordered Neelu to
go far away from your life.

1059
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:34,449
- What are you saying?
- Yes.

1060
01:55:34,761 --> 01:55:37,127
You cannot estimate the sacrifices
of that poor girl.

1061
01:55:37,397 --> 01:55:40,628
Despite her eyes having recovered,
she is living like a blind girl.

1062
01:55:41,301 --> 01:55:43,292
Why didn't you tell
me earlier that...

1063
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:45,469
...Neelu's operation has
been successful?

1064
01:55:45,905 --> 01:55:48,135
Because Neelu had made me promise
that I wouldn't tell anybody.

1065
01:55:48,408 --> 01:55:52,310
I told you today because both you
and Neelu are in trouble.

1066
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:55,146
Hurry up, Sameer. Neelu's
modesty is in danger.

1067
01:56:00,186 --> 01:56:02,086
Go and see if she has
come to her senses or not?

1068
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,693
Go...quick!

1069
01:56:14,867 --> 01:56:16,767
She's unconscious even now.

1070
01:56:25,378 --> 01:56:27,107
Sir, how about one more?

1071
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:31,282
Pour it. I'm feeling like
drinking with you today.

1072
01:56:32,552 --> 01:56:35,112
But the problem is that
Maya'll be coming today.

1073
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:39,653
She has to be picked up
at the station.

1074
01:56:39,892 --> 01:56:41,120
Her train will be arriving
in one hour's time.

1075
01:56:41,394 --> 01:56:43,294
But where had she gone?

1076
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:47,525
To collect one lakh rupees
from Balraj's insurance.

1077
01:56:49,769 --> 01:56:51,134
Looks like she has
come to her senses.

1078
01:56:51,371 --> 01:56:54,807
Not that...it's the main door.
Go and see who has come.

1079
01:57:04,183 --> 01:57:05,741
It's you, Diwanji?

1080
01:57:07,186 --> 01:57:09,086
Return the jewels, Pratap.

1081
01:57:10,189 --> 01:57:11,281
Which jewels?

1082
01:57:11,524 --> 01:57:13,082
The ones that my
daughter gave you.

1083
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:16,090
- Your daughter?
- She's foolish.

1084
01:57:16,396 --> 01:57:22,096
You had given proof of your
loyalty the very day...

1085
01:57:23,202 --> 01:57:26,103
...when you reached the
courts with my mother.

1086
01:57:27,507 --> 01:57:31,443
It was your day then.
Today is my day.

1087
01:57:33,746 --> 01:57:36,647
If you don't return the jewels,
I'll report to the police.

1088
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:39,116
You are most welcome.
Do it quickly.

1089
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:42,786
It's possible that your daughter and
I are imprisoned in the same cell.

1090
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:46,620
Looks like you are angry at me.

1091
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:52,459
But believe me...your daughter
won't be angry at me.

1092
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:54,800
- Rascal!
- Beware!

1093
01:57:57,403 --> 01:57:59,496
You too wanted to raise
your hands on me?

1094
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:08,405
What do you people think I am?
A stray dog who could be driven away?

1095
01:58:10,183 --> 01:58:14,586
If I want, I can skin you alive.

1096
01:58:16,722 --> 01:58:24,094
But no...I want you to get
a bad name in the world...

1097
01:58:24,363 --> 01:58:30,097
...so that you could feel
the pain of your insult.

1098
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:33,099
Throw him out of here.

1099
01:58:35,708 --> 01:58:38,609
Rascal...my boss has
spared your life today.

1100
01:58:39,278 --> 01:58:42,770
Don't you dare it again.

1101
01:58:44,217 --> 01:58:46,481
Get lost from here!

1102
01:58:50,389 --> 01:58:52,789
He has been chased away.
But the danger persists.

1103
01:58:53,392 --> 01:58:55,485
Where have you kept the
Queen Mother'sjewels?

1104
01:58:56,395 --> 01:58:59,796
In my room. Behind the
liquor bottles in the cupboard.

1105
01:59:00,233 --> 01:59:03,066
- But, sir...
- Don't worry.

1106
01:59:03,469 --> 01:59:06,404
He won't approach the police.
He has only one daughter.

1107
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:11,071
Till today, no father has caused
his daughter to be handcuffed.

1108
01:59:12,712 --> 01:59:15,078
I'm leaving. It's time
for Maya's arrival.

1109
01:59:15,348 --> 01:59:17,077
All right, sir.

1110
01:59:35,935 --> 01:59:37,630
No, no...don't beat me.

1111
01:59:37,937 --> 01:59:42,101
You are merely blind now. I'll make
you a cripple if you try to escape.

1112
01:59:43,376 --> 01:59:48,109
Hey! You aimed quiet accurately.
Tell me...are you really blind?

1113
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:56,479
I'm a blind, helpless girl.
And you are a man.

1114
01:59:57,023 --> 02:00:00,117
Notjust a man.
I'm your man.

1115
02:00:00,393 --> 02:00:05,126
If you obey me...make me happy...
I will make you my queen.

1116
02:00:05,898 --> 02:00:08,458
And if you try anything
against my wishes...

1117
02:00:08,968 --> 02:00:10,629
...I will beat you up severely.

1118
02:00:12,405 --> 02:00:14,305
'There's only one way to
escape from here'

1119
02:00:14,607 --> 02:00:16,507
'I should do as he says'

1120
02:00:19,478 --> 02:00:23,141
- I will do as you say.
- Sit here.

1121
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:31,156
I am really intoxicated.

1122
02:00:33,926 --> 02:00:35,826
Shall I sit in your lap?

1123
02:00:36,262 --> 02:00:38,162
You are a devil.

1124
02:00:39,265 --> 02:00:43,167
Let me fill vermilion
in your hair parting.

1125
02:00:43,436 --> 02:00:45,666
Now our marriage is confirmed.
Here, drink it...

1126
02:00:47,273 --> 02:00:49,173
- What is it?
- See for yourself.

1127
02:00:50,543 --> 02:00:52,170
- Drink it!
- I will.

1128
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:54,675
But I feel shy in your presence.

1129
02:00:55,281 --> 02:01:00,116
I will turn away.
Drink it quickly.

1130
02:01:02,888 --> 02:01:03,786
Here...

1131
02:01:05,224 --> 02:01:09,456
You gulped down in one go?

1132
02:01:14,233 --> 02:01:16,633
Make me happy today.

1133
02:01:17,737 --> 02:01:20,638
Sing an exciting song
for my amusement.

1134
02:01:20,973 --> 02:01:24,636
- A song?
- Yes, I know you sing well.

1135
02:01:25,244 --> 02:01:29,476
I will sing. But let me drink two
more sips. I'm feeling thirsty.

1136
02:01:29,749 --> 02:01:34,652
Make me happy first.
Sing a song for me.

1137
02:06:20,539 --> 02:06:23,099
- Haria!
- Where has he gone away?

1138
02:06:24,209 --> 02:06:26,609
I don't know. He must
be lying somewhere sozzled.

1139
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:44,661
Keep these jewels and some of my
clothes in the suitcase.

1140
02:06:44,964 --> 02:06:47,797
I will go and refresh myself.
Hurry up.

1141
02:07:02,181 --> 02:07:05,742
Swine! I had told you not
to try to cheat me.

1142
02:07:07,319 --> 02:07:09,082
If I hadn't followed you...

1143
02:07:09,455 --> 02:07:12,754
...you would've run away with your
lover boy with the one lakh rupees.

1144
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:14,159
Speak slowly.

1145
02:07:14,393 --> 02:07:16,759
Pratap is inside the bathroom.
You misunderstood me.

1146
02:07:17,196 --> 02:07:19,596
I was coming to you with the
money and the jewels.

1147
02:07:20,366 --> 02:07:23,096
The jewels alone must be
worth around 5 lakh rupees.

1148
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:25,769
You were really
coming to me?

1149
02:07:26,205 --> 02:07:28,765
I swear, darling.
Don't you believe me?

1150
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:31,604
All right, then.

1151
02:07:46,392 --> 02:07:47,290
Wait.

1152
02:07:48,427 --> 02:07:52,659
Balraj...keep the suitcase down.

1153
02:10:09,968 --> 02:10:11,128
You?

1154
02:10:11,403 --> 02:10:14,634
- Who are you?
- I am Neelu, a blind girl.

1155
02:10:16,241 --> 02:10:18,141
- What were you doing here?
- Nothing, sir.

1156
02:10:18,677 --> 02:10:20,645
Nothing at all, sir.

1157
02:10:21,413 --> 02:10:23,313
- Who's this girl?
- She's blind.

1158
02:10:27,853 --> 02:10:29,650
What was she doing here?

1159
02:10:30,255 --> 02:10:31,654
Hey! Stop!

1160
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:29,139
Sir...sir!

1161
02:12:32,411 --> 02:12:34,311
How could this happen, sir?

1162
02:12:34,579 --> 02:12:36,308
Somebody has killed her.

1163
02:12:36,581 --> 02:12:39,141
It's you who has murdered him.

1164
02:12:39,418 --> 02:12:41,147
What nonsense? He was dead
before I came here.

1165
02:12:41,386 --> 02:12:45,686
You have killed
him out of enmity.

1166
02:12:47,793 --> 02:12:50,159
What are you waiting for?
Catch him!

1167
02:12:58,370 --> 02:13:02,101
He has run away!

1168
02:13:03,375 --> 02:13:05,605
Go and inform the police.

1169
02:13:07,746 --> 02:13:09,646
Finish the tea quickly.
Then we will leave.

1170
02:13:30,402 --> 02:13:31,300
Yes?

1171
02:13:34,239 --> 02:13:35,638
Who are you?

1172
02:13:35,907 --> 02:13:38,137
I'm a pilot in the
National Airways.

1173
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:40,640
Balraj was among my
close friends.

1174
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:44,340
- Here...take this.
- What's this?

1175
02:13:45,250 --> 02:13:49,152
2000 rupees. I had taken a loan
from Balraj before his death.

1176
02:13:50,255 --> 02:13:54,157
I didn't get a chance
to return the amount.

1177
02:13:57,963 --> 02:14:00,090
I'm sorry. I hope I didn't
disturb you people.

1178
02:14:00,365 --> 02:14:04,096
- You people? But I live here alone.
- There are two cups of tea.

1179
02:14:04,369 --> 02:14:07,099
I always fill two cups,
in memory of Balraj.

1180
02:14:08,206 --> 02:14:10,106
Hey! A cigarette?

1181
02:14:10,375 --> 02:14:12,104
This too is a reminder of him.

1182
02:14:12,444 --> 02:14:15,106
He was a chain-smoker.
I smoke sometimes.

1183
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:17,109
Yes, he used to smoke a lot.

1184
02:14:18,984 --> 02:14:22,442
In this home, alone...

1185
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:30,118
Aren't you scared?

1186
02:14:35,233 --> 02:14:37,292
Where does one find such
women in today's times?

1187
02:14:38,236 --> 02:14:40,136
You are truly a noble woman.

1188
02:14:40,405 --> 02:14:43,135
You have even kept your
deceased husband's shoes.

1189
02:14:47,579 --> 02:14:49,137
I remember him a lot.

1190
02:14:49,414 --> 02:14:52,144
If you have something,
then do tell me.

1191
02:14:52,417 --> 02:14:54,146
I'm tired right now.

1192
02:15:06,264 --> 02:15:08,164
Where is Neelu?

1193
02:15:08,967 --> 02:15:11,435
Mr. Sameer...open the door!

1194
02:16:03,188 --> 02:16:05,088
- Neelu!
- Mr. Sameer!

1195
02:16:08,527 --> 02:16:10,154
What are you doing, Balraj?

1196
02:16:10,462 --> 02:16:13,090
Nothing. I'm only clearing
my path. Let's go.

1197
02:16:16,701 --> 02:16:19,101
The one whom you were fighting with,
he has murdered Pratap.

1198
02:16:19,871 --> 02:16:22,772
And now he's going out of India
by a plane alongwith Maya.

1199
02:16:27,212 --> 02:16:29,112
Don't let him go. Stop him.

1200
02:17:52,564 --> 02:17:55,624
Go the police station.
Give it to Inspector Saxena.

1201
02:18:00,338 --> 02:18:02,067
What could be the reason
for the plane's delay?

1202
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:04,240
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

1203
02:18:10,849 --> 02:18:11,747
Thank you.

1204
02:18:12,350 --> 02:18:15,251
One can change one's appearance by
changing a disguise, not your habits.

1205
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,081
Your left hand gave you away.

1206
02:18:37,876 --> 02:18:40,606
- Leave me.
- Where will you go, you witch?

1207
02:18:46,551 --> 02:18:47,609
What's the matter?

1208
02:20:31,256 --> 02:20:32,154
No!

1209
02:20:33,425 --> 02:20:34,323
No!
