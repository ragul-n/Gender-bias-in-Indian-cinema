1
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,200
Hey, go to Williamsburg.
You going to go to--

2
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,667
Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

3
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,367
Going to Williamsburg.
North 6th and Wythe.

4
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,367
Do you mind?
I'll just hang onto you.

5
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,234
Can you just drop me off
at Williamsburg Bridge?

6
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,534
That's fine because I'm headed
into the Bowery. Do you mind?

7
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,200
All right, that's fine.
We'll just split a fare.

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,667
Two stops.
Yeah. Chamber Street.

9
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,167
Just take the FDR--
No, no, not FDR Drive.

10
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,200
Not Chamber Street. No.
Oh, my God.
If you take FDR Drive,

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,567
first of all,
it's more of a fare.
I do this every single day.

12
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,234
It's an extra 20 minutes.
I got to be somewhere.

13
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:29,701
Take the FDR Drive, please.
It's a lot faster.

14
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:31,567
I think we can hang down
the West Side Highway

15
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,567
and make a left
on Chamber Street.

16
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,400
There's no point, though.
There's going to be--

17
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,667
Bleecker, guys.
We're going Bleecker.

18
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,868
No, we both want
to go to the same area.

19
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:41,133
Bleecker's going to take
an extra hour.

20
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,334
Bleecker Street is totally
out of the direction.
That's ridiculous.

21
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,067
Both of you, out of the cab.

22
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,501
Wait a second.
Calm down, man.

23
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:50,334
We're not going to get out.
We'll share the same rate.
We're not going to Bleecker.

24
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:53,033
Out of my cab.

25
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,601
Hey, sweetheart.
How you doing? It's me.

26
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:10,601
I'm doing good.
Thinking of you.
Hey.

27
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,300
Yeah, I dreamt
about you last night.

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,667
I'm ready for you.
Had my Wheaties.

29
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,801
I miss you, too.

30
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,267
You ready?

31
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,701
Okay. I got some surprises.

32
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,601
Whoa. Magnifique.

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,934
Pardon. Excusez-moi,
mademoiselle.

34
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,834
This yours?

35
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:53,701
Um, it is. It must have
fallen out of my bag.

36
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,367
It was on the floor
near the bathroom.

37
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,968
That was really nice of you.
How can I thank you?

38
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:01,267
I wouldn't mind
if you bought me a drink.

39
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:02,734
Great. What would you like?

40
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,801
Whatever you're having.
Two gin and tonics, no ice.

41
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,067
Losing your cell phone's
like losing your mind.

42
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,267
Do you come here a lot?

43
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,067
I do. A lot. Too much.

44
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,934
Long story.

45
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,067
Tell me.

46
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,734
I've got a ton of time.

47
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:20,067
I only saw my dad
once in my whole life,

48
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,734
right here.

49
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,234
When my mom
was pregnant with me,

50
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:25,267
she never told him.

51
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,567
Just left him.

52
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,200
Growing up, she had
a lot of boyfriends.

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,934
Went through one
after another.

54
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:31,100
Always left them.

55
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,734
Every time she'd leave
a man, though,

56
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,334
she'd keep something,
like a souvenir.

57
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:37,567
Maybe a book or a necklace
or a painting.

58
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,934
When she left my dad,
she kept me.

59
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:41,267
I was her souvenir.

60
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:43,567
Before she died,
she gave me a piece of paper

61
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,100
with his name
and number on it.

62
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,968
I called him up,
and we met here.

63
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:49,100
I said one thing to him.

64
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,968
What did you say?

65
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,100
"Dad."

66
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,434
That's it?

67
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,734
"I'm a gift for you,
from Mom."

68
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,033
Thank you.

69
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,534
I walk past your
flower room every day.

70
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:07,767
I see you,
but I say nothing.

71
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:11,267
I'm so afraid
to look at you.
Oh, girl.

72
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:14,968
You say I'm the strongest.
I say you're the kindest.

73
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:18,467
You ask me where I'm going.
I point to the ocean.

74
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,968
Oh, girl.

75
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,634
Very touching.

76
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,601
Lyrics to this song.

77
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:27,033
Let me have a cigarette.

78
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:32,167
Indian?
I think it's Japanese.

79
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,501
Chinese.
Chinese?

80
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:40,133
Xie xie.

81
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:44,634
Incroyable.

82
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:48,901
Which means "Thank you,
I fuck, and you're off-key."

83
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:52,901
He found my phone for me.

84
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,167
Really? Very nice.
Thank you.

85
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,234
Gary. Nice to meet you.

86
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,167
Ben.

87
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,167
How are you, Benjamin?

88
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,167
Just Ben.

89
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,033
Thank you.

90
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,167
Nice to meet you.

91
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,167
I'll leave you two alone.

92
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,200
Have a seat. Sit.

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,067
Sit down.

94
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:21,667
We know each other?

95
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:22,968
It's possible.

96
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:23,934
You look familiar.

97
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,534
New York's not such
a big place.

98
00:06:25,534 --> 00:06:26,534
You study? NYU?

99
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:27,534
I wish.

100
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,200
I teach there.

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,334
Am I a good teacher?

102
00:06:30,334 --> 00:06:31,367
You're a good teacher.
Thank you.

103
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,667
So what do you do?

104
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,033
Thief.

105
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,534
Could be.
That is funny.

106
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,734
Might be? Used to be?

107
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,000
Will be?

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,200
To be or not to be.
Well, I'm a thief.

109
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,300
I've been trying to steal you
from your wife,

110
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,000
but it hasn't worked so far.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
Can I get the bill?

112
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:58,033
You lost your wallet?

113
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,667
You lost your wallet.

114
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,501
Is this yours?

115
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:09,567
Wow.

116
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,834
Yeah, that's my wallet.

117
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,634
Merci beaucoup.
Money's gone.

118
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:18,300
I recently lost my wallet,

119
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,901
but I managed
to get my money back.

120
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,767
A young man should never
be without cash.

121
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,033
Knock yourself out,
young man.

122
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,167
You lost your wallet?

123
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,367
Did you lose
my pictures, too?

124
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:48,300
Pictures?
How could I?

125
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,567
How did you get these?

126
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,400
I took these, like,
five minutes ago.

127
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,434
Aren't you full
of surprises today.

128
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,300
You took off your ring.

129
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,934
Ben, your keys.

130
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,701
Mm.

131
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:39,267
Ben, wait up!

132
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:26,200
I've come into the city

133
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,634
only to do this deal,
so it better be good.

134
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,567
My customer
wants natts, ASAP.

135
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,767
I'm in the middle
of my wedding arrangements,

136
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,200
but I came here to do
this business with you.

137
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,934
Who are you
getting married to?

138
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:37,801
His name's Chaim.

139
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:42,200
ยง Chaim in the mood ยง

140
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,667
ยง For love ยง

141
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,267
Where's my invitation
for your wedding?

142
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,267
Did you invite me
to your wedding?

143
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, I wish I had.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,133
25 years I've been trading
with Hasidic people.

145
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,501
I know nothing about them.
They know nothing
about Jain peoples.

146
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:02,734
Strictly business.
We don't come to 47th Street
to chitchat.

147
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,667
While you inspect the goods,
I'm going to eat.

148
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,033
Excuse me. Hmm?

149
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,200
You can't eat meat, right?
You Hindus?

150
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,701
No, we are not Hindus.
We are Jains.

151
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,834
Hinduism is too
materialistic for us.

152
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,167
No meat, no fish.

153
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,100
And what can't you eat?
No pig, no shrimp.

154
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,834
What else can't you eat?
No onion, no garlic.

155
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,434
No milk and meat together.
No potato, no roots.

156
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:30,033
Nothing that hasn't
been blessed.
Nothing too spicy.

157
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,100
It is exciting the passions,
you know.

158
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,868
The Christians--
they eat everything.

159
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,200
They're like the Chinese.

160
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,033
They never have to
spend too much time

161
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,234
picking a restaurant.

162
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:39,567
That's why
there are no Christians

163
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:40,701
in the diamond market.

164
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:41,934
How can you trust a person

165
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,200
who will eat anything?

166
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:47,000
This parcel's
not so good.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,334
At least 20% rejection
you've given me.

168
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,267
How much?

169
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,934
550.

170
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:01,834
Too much.
Way too much.

171
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,534
I'll give you 480.

172
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:04,968
Why are you doing this
to me?

173
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:07,267
My children
will be crying at home

174
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,901
because after
I do business with you,
I have no money for food.

175
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,601
I can't make
commission on this.

176
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:13,067
540.

177
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:16,234
Maybe I can give my children
some dry bread.

178
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:20,000
I have to check
with my customer.

179
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,734
My customer
says too much.

180
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,400
No, he doesn't.

181
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,834
I know
you understand Gujarati.

182
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,901
That's why I lied.

183
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,901
And I know you know
I know Gujarati.

184
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,234
And I know
you know Yiddish.

185
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:41,267
I was speaking
to an answering machine.

186
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:46,300
520, as a wedding present.
Mazel.

187
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,100
I'm sorry.
I can't shake your hand.

188
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,734
I'm not allowed
to touch any man

189
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:51,534
who isn't my husband.

190
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,367
Mazel.

191
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,067
And mazel for your wedding.

192
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:58,067
Mazel for the dozen children
you'll soon have.

193
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,601
Thank you.
Is that your children?

194
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:03,267
Minesh and Paresh.

195
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:06,501
Where's your wife?
Oh, she's not looking
that good

196
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:09,534
in the photographs
these days.

197
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:11,834
Oi.

198
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:15,000
Last year she decided
that marriage was a sin.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now she's in India,

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,968
with her head shaved,
going door to door,

201
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:20,567
collecting food in the bowl.

202
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:23,701
She used to be my wife.

203
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,467
Now I have to worship her.

204
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:30,067
Don't worry.
She's not the only one
without hair.

205
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,000
I had to shave off
all mine this morning

206
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,400
'cause I'm getting
married tomorrow.

207
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,634
This is a wig.

208
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:39,033
Why? What is so wrong
with women's hair anyway?

209
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,567
Why you all want
to cut it off?

210
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,467
They wanted me to cut it off
on my wedding night.

211
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,601
I said "No way."
Yeah?

212
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:49,067
It took 25 years to grow,
10 minutes to cut off.

213
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,901
And now,
for the rest of my life,

214
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:55,267
I have to wear
some other woman's hair.

215
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,767
For all I know,

216
00:12:57,767 --> 00:13:01,200
you could be wearing
my wife's hair right now.

217
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,300
What do you mean,
your wife's hair?

218
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,033
Most human hair in America
comes from our temples
in India,

219
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,834
where women offer
their long locks to God

220
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:15,000
so that they
can be sold to the West
and you can have your wigs.

221
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,234
While we are waiting
for the Messiah,

222
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:46,200
while we are waiting
for Mahavir...

223
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,200
your eyes will suffice

224
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,534
to give tired men hope.

225
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:11,400
This is not the proper
etiquette in this neighborhood.

226
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,300
What is this?

227
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:47,033
Rifka!

228
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,400
Rifka!

229
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,567
Mansukhbai!

230
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,334
Ah, oui?
Ah, oui.

231
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Oh, I'm s--
I'm so sorry.

232
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,067
Wow, that's an entrance.

233
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,567
Wait. Which way
are you going?

234
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,334
Uh, I was just gonna go over
cross town to the East Side.

235
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh, I guess
I can film there, too.
Okay, let's go.

236
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:30,767
Thank you so much.

237
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,167
You're welcome.

238
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:56,634
Hello?

239
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,200
David? Are you okay?

240
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,701
Did I wake you?
Yeah.

241
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,300
Yeah, you can say that.

242
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,667
Listen, he left me a message
about a couple of music cues.

243
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:11,834
Who?

244
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,834
Abara, your director.

245
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,267
Uh, okay, which ones?

246
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,167
5, 7, 8, 12, 13--

247
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,634
Okay. Okay, great.
What was the message?

248
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,300
He hates them.

249
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,567
You have to change them.

250
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,133
Because?

251
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:30,534
He didn't say.

252
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,467
Oh, well,

253
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,467
what do you think, Camille?

254
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,567
Maybe you should
talk to him directly.

255
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:41,234
Mmm. Yeah.

256
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,667
Yeah, I'll call him.

257
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:47,267
Hey, Camille.
It's your favorite stalker.

258
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,934
Did you talk to Abara?
Yeah, we talked.

259
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:53,667
He talked for, like, two hours
about, like, composers--

260
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:58,601
Wagner, Brahms, Gustav Mahler,
Tchaikovsky, Dostoyevsky.

261
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,801
That killed me.

262
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:02,734
Dostoyevsky
isn't a composer.

263
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:04,534
Are you okay?
Never better.

264
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:06,634
Great. Well,
I need your address.

265
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:09,100
Abara wants to messenger
you something right away.

266
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,701
Does he?

267
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:13,133
Hold on.

268
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:18,834
Aw. It's on my phone.

269
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:21,701
I'm a total idiot
when it comes to numbers
and addresses.

270
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,734
My last girlfriend...
Uh-huh?

271
00:18:23,734 --> 00:18:25,267
I couldn't remember
her birthday.

272
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:26,601
She broke up with me
because of that.

273
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, well,
you deserved it.

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,901
Probably. But the upside
is that I'm single now.

275
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,634
So, dinner?

276
00:18:32,634 --> 00:18:34,634
You're sleep deprived, David.

277
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:37,234
No. I'm Camille deprived.

278
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:39,868
I'm thinking
Balthazar for dinner

279
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,467
and maybe a little pastis
for dessert.

280
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm thinking unemployment
if you don't finish
those cues on time.

281
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,100
Give me your address.

282
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,434
Hello?

283
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,234
Hey, did you get the books?

284
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:58,868
I left them
outside your door.

285
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:02,634
Wait. What-- You were here?
Why didn't you call?

286
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:05,200
I knocked, like,
a hundred times.

287
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,334
What the hell is this?

288
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,767
He talked to you
about Dostoyevsky.

289
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,000
"Please read."

290
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,834
Is this guy crazy? Am I--

291
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:20,000
Am I supposed to read these
or eat them?

292
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,501
Okay, David.
I'm gonna put you through
to Abara, okay?

293
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,801
You can talk to him.

294
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,734
How'd it go with Abara?

295
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:35,434
He just said
"Read the books, Dave.

296
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:37,434
"Don't use CliffNotes
or Wikipedia.

297
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:40,234
Just read them." So fine.

298
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:43,067
I'm on a bench in Central Park
with The Brothers Karamazov.

299
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,634
800 pages, and I'm page 22.

300
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,934
Ouch.

301
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,901
Bless you.

302
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:56,534
Thanks.

303
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:58,601
What? What's wrong?

304
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:01,968
I can see the Dakota.
Hmm.

305
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,400
John Lennon...is my god.

306
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,901
You know his song "Mother"?
Yeah.

307
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,667
I was a kid
the first time I heard that.

308
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,267
Why can't I write
a song like "Mother"?

309
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:14,033
Oh, I just
sent you a picture.

310
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,534
Oh, my God.

311
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:17,234
Is that John Lennon
standing behind you?

312
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:19,634
What?
I'm just kidding.

313
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:23,200
I have no idea
what you look like, Camille.

314
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,567
Hmm.

315
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,267
Send me a picture.

316
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,868
No. No way.

317
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,801
Is that what you look like?

318
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,501
If you're calling for Camille,

319
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:51,334
please leave a message
after the beep.

320
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,367
There are 1,784 pages,

321
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,534
and it takes me four minutes
to read one page.

322
00:20:55,534 --> 00:20:58,834
1,784 pages times
four minutes a page

323
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:01,634
is 7,136 minutes,

324
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:04,200
which equals 118.9333 hours,

325
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
which comes to 4.955 days.

326
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,100
But you can round it off
to five days without sleeping.

327
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,901
It's impossible. I quit.

328
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,200
I quit.

329
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,901
Goodbye, Camille.

330
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,801
Hello?

331
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:39,734
Please leave a message
after the beep.

332
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:46,167
Hey, David. It's Camille.

333
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:50,133
You know, when Dostoyevsky
was writing The Gambler,

334
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,067
he signed a contract
with his publisher

335
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:55,567
saying that he would
finish it in 26 days.

336
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,167
And he did it,

337
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:00,567
but he had the help
of this young stenographer.

338
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:04,901
This girl--
she stayed with him,
and she helped him.

339
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,567
And afterwards,

340
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:10,100
they actually got married.

341
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,434
Isn't that cool?

342
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,834
That's how he met his wife.

343
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,367
Anyway, I found this story

344
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,367
in the preface
for Crime and Punishment.

345
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,734
So I was thinking that--

346
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:24,634
And this would have to be
between you and me.

347
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:28,834
But I was thinking that
I could read the books

348
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,834
and tell you
what's going on.

349
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,767
That way, you could just
focus on your music.

350
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,567
But only if you're
comfortable with this.

351
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,334
And if you're not, you know,
we can just forget it,

352
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:40,167
and you can quit.

353
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,367
But if you are,

354
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:46,434
then open this door.

355
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:51,100
Open...this door?

356
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,901
Okay, a deal's a deal.

357
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:27,133
Does this mean
we're getting married?

358
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:30,667
I have a lot of reading to do.

359
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:38,200
Hi. I'm Camille.

360
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,467
Hi. I'm David.

361
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:19,767
Hello?

362
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,467
Where?

363
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,601
Thank you.

364
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:44,033
That was kind of a powerful,
intimate situation.

365
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,701
What was intimate?

366
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:49,400
Just now. Just-- We...

367
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Sharing the flame.

368
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,467
I mean, that was--
that was intimate.

369
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:54,601
If you say so.

370
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:55,901
Oh, come on now.

371
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,467
You know what I'm
talking about.

372
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,234
Our hands almost touched.

373
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:02,334
I looked at you, and you
lifted your head up slowly,

374
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,567
and our eyes met.

375
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,434
It was-- It was--
It was intense,

376
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:06,834
and it was intimate.

377
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:10,033
Wow. Stop it.
I feel naked.

378
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:12,067
Yeah, well, you know what?
I have that effect on women.

379
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,234
I mean, not all women.
No, not all women.

380
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:16,334
But it has happened before,
so don't be alarmed.

381
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:19,334
Yeah, I bet.
Yeah. Don't ignore
what's happening here.

382
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:21,234
We're having some kind
of powerful, weird alchemy,

383
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:23,133
and you have to pay attention
when that happens.

384
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:26,300
This stuff is not
to be treated lightly.

385
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,033
Listen, I actually
just came out here

386
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,634
to have a cigarette,
okay?

387
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,968
And relax and do my thing.
Okay. No. Sure.
Sure. Yeah.

388
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:34,000
So, uh,
maybe another time.

389
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,667
Yeah. But there may not
be another time. Okay?

390
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,000
I may never get
this chance again.

391
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,701
I mean, we may never,
you know,

392
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:42,133
be able to return
to this-- this moment.

393
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,968
Well, then, you should know
that I'm married and happy.

394
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:48,167
Right. Uh-huh.
And where is he?

395
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,634
Huh? Huh?

396
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:52,133
He leaves you out here alone,
in the dark, without a light.

397
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:54,567
I'm not feeling that.
Well, he doesn't smoke, so--

398
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,033
But you love him anyway.
Yeah. Why not?

399
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,067
Sure. Sure.
He just abandons you, huh,

400
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:03,334
to your mortal disease,
and leaves you alone to suffer

401
00:27:03,334 --> 00:27:05,467
and die, when he's in there
pretending to love you?

402
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:08,000
I don't respect this guy.
I think he's a coward.

403
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
I think he's selfish.
And forgive me for saying this,

404
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,868
but I think any moment now,
this guy's gonna open up
his real self to you,

405
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,200
and it's gonna be all--

406
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,067
like, scary stuff's
gonna come out.

407
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,400
You know,
I felt it right away.

408
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
I felt it right away--
that I think--

409
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
I'm gonna say something
a little bold here.

410
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,868
But I think you might
be married to the wrong person.

411
00:27:25,868 --> 00:27:28,501
I don't know that
even if that were true

412
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,534
that I'd tell you.
Right.

413
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:32,667
We're not exactly friends.
No, we're not.

414
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:33,968
No.
That's true.

415
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,534
But we did share a flame.
Right?

416
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:37,100
Speaking of.
Oh.

417
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,901
See? Look at that.
See? You need me.

418
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:40,901
You're walking away,
and you need me.

419
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:44,133
We share a flame.
Thousands of tiny molecules
are heating up right now.

420
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,501
They're penetrating
our brain.

421
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,534
They're stimulating
our sexual desire.

422
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:50,334
I don't know about you,
but I find that shit
very romantic.

423
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,133
And I'm so glad
you walked over here

424
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,133
because now I can feel
a little bit more comfortable

425
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:56,467
to tell you
that I happen to be,

426
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,434
uh, on the forefront
of men

427
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:01,501
able to find and locate
a woman's G-spot.

428
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,434
And I could
do that for you.

429
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,234
That's really generous
of you. Thank you.

430
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:08,901
It's my pleasure.
Well, it's your pleasure.

431
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:10,834
And what makes you think
I haven't located it yet?

432
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,901
Um, the way you hold
the cigarette.

433
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,200
It's a little high
and tight, you know?

434
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,033
What you have to do
is you have to lower it.

435
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:20,901
You have to bring it
all the way down in there
so it just sits comfortably.

436
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,234
It rests there.
If it's high
and tight like that,

437
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,934
the whole body
gets restricted,

438
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:27,334
and the plexus
gets closed off,

439
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:30,434
you know, and the vagina
gets locked.

440
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,634
Look, I just happen to know
this crazy, weird technique
with the vagina.

441
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:35,701
It's kind of cool,
and I thought
you'd be interested.

442
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:37,234
But you have to
be prepared.

443
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,501
You know what I mean?
Preparation is the key.

444
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:42,767
I mean, it starts
with a little walk.
Just a short walk, like...

445
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,334
You know, like, to, uh--
like my apartment.

446
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:47,334
It's a couple blocks from here.
And we would walk,

447
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:50,400
and I would tell you
a few little elegant,
classy jokes.

448
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,634
You know, kind of getting us

449
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,701
a little giggly,
a little silly.

450
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:57,667
You know? And then we'd share
a glass of Burgundy.
Burgundy?

451
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:58,968
Yeah.

452
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:01,634
We'd bask
in the warm, gentle,

453
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:03,767
romantic yet erotic
glow

454
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,901
of, uh, my spacious loft.

455
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:08,667
And then
I would undress you,

456
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,400
and you would undress me.

457
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,334
We'd stand naked before
each other, and we'd kiss.

458
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,901
I find-- I find kissing
a very helpful,

459
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,167
sweet way to-- to relax.

460
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,901
And then, maybe I would--
I would--

461
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,467
I would bite your neck
a little bit.

462
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:24,267
Not-- Not hard. Just gentle--
gentle little nibbles,

463
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,467
like-- like a little kitty cat,
you know?

464
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:29,167
And then--
And then you would feel

465
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,167
my hands kind of descend
to your lower region,

466
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,400
kind of, uh,
finding their way,

467
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,534
massaging the skin
around your clitoris,

468
00:29:37,534 --> 00:29:41,067
which would even
stimulate the arousal
even more.

469
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:42,467
All the time,
I'm whispering

470
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:45,100
delicate little poems
in your ear, you know?

471
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,634
And the blood
from your body

472
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:51,167
is-- is rushing
to the wet internal walls,

473
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,000
and my fingers
would slide effortlessly--

474
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,968
Are you an actor or something?

475
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,567
Or a comedian?
You're a comedian.

476
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:02,667
No. I, uh--
I'm kind of a writer.

477
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,200
Oh, you're kind of a writer.
Yeah, kind of.

478
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,901
You know, what about you?
What do you do?

479
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:11,100
I'm a hooker.

480
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,734
What exactly does that mean?

481
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,767
That exactly means that people
pay to have sex with me.

482
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,767
Mm-hmm.

483
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,467
So, if I wanted
to, um...

484
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,000
Here's my card.

485
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,133
It's got my number
and my Web site on it.

486
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,434
So wow.
You're, uh...

487
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:31,868
That's why you're--
Fridays is no good.

488
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:33,767
Saturdays and Sunday
are busy.

489
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:36,367
Weekends are...
Avoid weekends.

490
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,801
You know, I look forward
to hearing from you

491
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:42,000
and sharing another...
intimate moment.

492
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:54,400
Well, fuck me.

493
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,667
In New York City,

494
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,200
there are currently
759 drugstores

495
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,501
and over 1,600
registered pharmacists.

496
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,701
On the day of my senior prom,

497
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,868
one of them
would change my life.

498
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:49,100
Shit bums.
They lose 2 to 1 again.
One run.

499
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,133
They couldn't
hit a ball with an oar.
Listen, this is on the house.

500
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:54,767
I heard about what happened
with you and that girl
you were dating.

501
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,100
Oh.
I'm really sorry.

502
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,434
And on prom night.

503
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,367
Like there's gonna
be other proms.

504
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,934
Well, there's not
gonna be another prom.

505
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,734
Not now, not ever.

506
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:06,367
She's a whore, all right?
Crushing a young man's dreams.

507
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:09,334
She's a snake fucking
devil whore is what she is.

508
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:12,634
She's got no right.
It's-- It's really--
It's all right.

509
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:15,567
I mean, we only went out
a couple months,
and I'm okay with it.

510
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,901
Here's the thing.
I'm gonna help you.

511
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,400
Come here for a second.

512
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,133
I got something
to show you.

513
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:27,300
That's my daughter.
She'll go to the prom
with you tonight.

514
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
It's the right thing
to do.

515
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,601
And that's not
chopped liver, right?

516
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:32,901
Nuh-uh.

517
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:36,501
I was 17, and I'd only
been to second base,

518
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:39,501
but I felt like tonight
could be my lucky night.

519
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:40,300
Hey, kid.

520
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,868
Hey, Mr. Riccoli.
Hey.

521
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:44,868
Call me Frank.
Oh. Yeah.

522
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:47,367
You look good.
Thanks.

523
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:48,701
Oh. Hey.

524
00:32:57,133 --> 00:33:00,300
Listen, try to get her home
by 12:00, 12:30.

525
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,367
She's gotta
take her pills.

526
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,667
Why are you stopping?

527
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:20,434
That's my girlfriend.

528
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
Hey.

529
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,767
Hi.

530
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:29,234
I'm sorry.
I came with Gil.

531
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:31,200
He's a film major
at NYU.

532
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,434
Oh, that-- that's cool.

533
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:35,200
We're-- We're cool.
Whatever.

534
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,534
It's no biggie, you know?

535
00:33:36,534 --> 00:33:39,133
How's your, uh,
swimmer's ear?

536
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,133
Good. Better.

537
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:44,033
Who's your date?

538
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:47,434
Make-A-Wish.

539
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:49,234
Yeah. Yeah.

540
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:51,033
You know, it was her dream
to go to prom,

541
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:54,367
and I said, "Of course I'll
make your dream come true."

542
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,667
I want to dance.

543
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,334
Uh, we should--
we should talk first.

544
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:19,701
I want to dance.

545
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:21,834
Everybody clap your hands.

546
00:34:23,634 --> 00:34:25,667
Check it out, y'all.

547
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,334
How low can you go?

548
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,267
Can you go down low?

549
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,267
All the way to the floor?

550
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:33,234
How low can you go?

551
00:34:33,234 --> 00:34:35,200
Can you bring it
to the top?

552
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,133
Like you'll never,
never stop?

553
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:38,801
Wait! That's my limo!

554
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:41,000
You've got your own wheels.

555
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:52,801
Want to walk me home
through the park?

556
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,834
Through the park?

557
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,234
Thanks.

558
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,934
I had a really
good time tonight.

559
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,501
Me, too.

560
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:10,534
I should probably
take you home.

561
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,701
Make a wish.

562
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,367
I really can't think

563
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:19,200
of anything right now.

564
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:22,434
Come on.

565
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,834
Take my panties off.

566
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:28,434
Come on.

567
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:42,334
Yeah, that's them.

568
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,534
Okay, now take
your pants off.

569
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,734
Hurry.

570
00:35:57,734 --> 00:35:59,634
Come on.

571
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:06,501
Come here.

572
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:10,601
Grab my legs.

573
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,300
That's it.

574
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:36,734
Mmm, it's morning.

575
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:40,934
Oh, fuck!

576
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:53,133
-Motherfuckers.
-I'm sorry.

577
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,501
I'm so sorry.

578
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:57,300
They lose it in the 9th--
these rat bastards.

579
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,567
They lost it 8 to 7.
8 to 7.

580
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,934
Them Yankees
need some pitching.
Hi, Daddy.

581
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,801
Hi, baby.

582
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,968
Listen,
I, uh-- I really want
to thank you very much.

583
00:37:06,968 --> 00:37:10,367
There are not too many
young men like you left
in this city.

584
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,267
Well, it's my pleasure.

585
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:27,968
Yeah, New York actresses--
they drive you nuts.

586
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:29,601
Actresses?

587
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:31,133
Last year,
she played Helen Keller.

588
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:33,901
She walked around the city
for two weeks, blindfolded.

589
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:35,968
You know, to get
the feeling of the part.

590
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:38,767
Broke her nose twice.
Now she's doing
this thing downtown--

591
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:41,400
what the fuck--
Whose Life is it Anyway?

592
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,801
Anyway-- Anyway,
she's doing 20 hours a day
in a chair now.

593
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:48,300
Central Park covers
almost 843 acres.

594
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,868
It is 6% of Manhattan.

595
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:55,534
There are also 127,000
Method actresses in New York,

596
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:58,133
which is 2%
of the population.

597
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:00,901
And on the night
of my senior prom,

598
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:02,901
these two elements
came together

599
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:06,634
to make one perfect wish
come true.

600
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:09,801
God, I love New York.

601
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:18,000
ยง And here I am ยง

602
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,467
ยง The only living boy
in New York ยง

603
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:45,934
All right, guys.
I'm done.

604
00:38:45,934 --> 00:38:48,100
I'm out. Yeah.

605
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,934
Thanks, man.

606
00:38:49,934 --> 00:38:51,667
Hey.
Hey.

607
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,901
You look like you're gonna
have a heart attack.

608
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:55,634
That was nothing.

609
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,934
You know what?

610
00:38:57,934 --> 00:39:01,367
Give me a sec, all right?
Just gonna go say bye.

611
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,400
My man.
All right.

612
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
That's for you.

613
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,033
Now, with a little bit
more practice...

614
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:15,667
I ain't practicing.

615
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,634
You had me going.
Hey.

616
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,968
You're good.

617
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:21,934
Yeah?
Yeah.

618
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:24,767
All right.
Let's go.

619
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:42,634
I don't know why
I said I'd meet him.

620
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:44,601
I know I gave him my number,
but when?

621
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,534
When we said goodbye?

622
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:48,734
Oh, yeah.
It was at the bar.

623
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,467
I didn't realize we were
gonna go home together

624
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:53,834
at that point.

625
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:55,634
Idiot.

626
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:57,801
Why did I do that?

627
00:39:57,801 --> 00:40:00,334
Why did I act like that?

628
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:03,434
I'm only gonna have
two drinks tonight.

629
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,701
I'm not gonna
have sex with him.
I don't want to.

630
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:08,200
I really don't.

631
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,567
God, I had no intention

632
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,801
of going home
with him or anyone.

633
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:13,801
When he sat down next to me,
it was so clear

634
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:17,400
we weren't each other's style
that it wasn't even weird.

635
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,567
And since there was no vibe,
we just started talking

636
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:22,067
without thinking anything,

637
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:24,934
and then I don't know
what happened.

638
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:27,934
It's a bad idea
with this girl.

639
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:30,000
What am I saying?
She's not a girl.

640
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,734
I have no idea
how old she is,

641
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:33,734
but she's not a fucking girl.

642
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:36,467
Why am I walking
30 blocks to this bar?

643
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,634
I'm not in a good space
for this.

644
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah, she was beautiful.
Yes, she had a great body,
and she's smart.

645
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,868
Was she even drunk?
I don't even know.

646
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:46,067
I don't even know what she was.
Does it really matter?

647
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:48,234
Ow. Am I imagining things,
or is my dick itching?

648
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:50,968
No, no, no.
It's just these pants.

649
00:40:50,968 --> 00:40:53,133
They always rub me
the wrong way.

650
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,767
God, that was sexy.

651
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:58,801
It was beyond sexy.

652
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:02,567
I felt like I was in
a damn Bertolucci movie.

653
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:09,300
What is wrong with me?
Why am I so fucking nervous?

654
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,234
This is ridiculous.
Let's just get in a cab.

655
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:16,734
No, you're too early. Shit!
I need a cigarette.

656
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:18,701
I don't think I was drunk.

657
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:21,167
Although I definitely had
red wine teeth
when I came home.

658
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,067
I'm sure he found that
really attractive

659
00:41:23,067 --> 00:41:25,334
as I sat at the bar
yammering about myself.

660
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,634
Oh, no wonder he was so
excited when we got home.

661
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:29,734
I finally shut the fuck up.

662
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:31,634
Yeah.

663
00:41:31,634 --> 00:41:34,701
I hardly said a word
the rest of the night
after that.

664
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,200
It was good,

665
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,167
but there's nowhere
for it to go.

666
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,634
I think it would've been fine
if it was just sex,

667
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,400
but it took another turn.

668
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,067
Something happened.
I don't know what zone
that was,

669
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:50,200
but both of us
played into it.

670
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:54,834
It's good
we're gonna do this--

671
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:57,234
have a couple of drinks
and get straight.

672
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:59,734
Let him know
I know what this was--

673
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:02,234
nothing.

674
00:42:03,934 --> 00:42:05,901
God, I hate that window.

675
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,801
I don't want
to see the innards
of the subway system.

676
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:11,467
Makes me feel sick.

677
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:13,601
Just get me there.

678
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:32,567
Hi. Can I get a Jameson?
Great.

679
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:56,400
Here you go.
Thanks.

680
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:12,767
You left that on.

681
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:15,901
Yeah.
I'll look at it later.

682
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:55,000
Madame.

683
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,267
Thank you.

684
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,167
This is not the room
I wanted.

685
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:27,334
I don't find it comfortable
so near to the street.

686
00:48:27,334 --> 00:48:29,200
The noise.

687
00:48:46,501 --> 00:48:48,501
I can carry my bags.

688
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:50,434
That is my job.

689
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:11,501
This is good.

690
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:19,000
I was hoping it would snow.

691
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:24,100
Then the street is quiet.

692
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,968
The world goes quiet.

693
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:34,033
I don't think
there is snow.

694
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:36,701
You're not American.
No.

695
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:39,701
No, we're not so many of us
American in this hotel.

696
00:49:41,234 --> 00:49:44,300
It's one of the things
I love best about New York.

697
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,968
Everyone came
from somewhere else.

698
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:51,067
Yeah.

699
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:54,367
Well, I hope you will be
very comfortable here.

700
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,734
Please call down
if you need anything.

701
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:03,033
There are no flowers.

702
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:08,067
Is it possible
to have flowers in the room?

703
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:12,000
Violets? Or...

704
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,634
I love violets.

705
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:20,534
I'm not expecting you
to buy them, of course,

706
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:23,334
if you, uh--
if you don't have them.

707
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:27,667
I'm sure
I can find some violets.

708
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:46,434
Come in.

709
00:50:49,901 --> 00:50:51,634
How did you do that?

710
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:54,434
I didn't do anything.

711
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:56,200
You must have
requested them.

712
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,901
They were downstairs
in lobby.

713
00:50:57,901 --> 00:50:59,701
I didn't.

714
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:01,634
All the better.

715
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:09,601
Incredible.

716
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,234
So you're lucky, no?

717
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:16,567
These violets
were waiting for you.

718
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:19,767
Are there any other
miracles I can perform?

719
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:24,501
Oh, I doubt it.

720
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:32,567
What-- What's happened?

721
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:35,334
Here, here.

722
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:37,934
Oh.

723
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:42,133
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
Here, here, here.

724
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:44,267
No, no. Come on.

725
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,200
Put your head back.

726
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,267
Are you in pain?

727
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:08,267
It's not my business.
Fr--

728
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:10,901
From your back?

729
00:52:10,901 --> 00:52:12,834
Wait here.

730
00:53:28,434 --> 00:53:30,767
I have something
for you.

731
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,300
Please?

732
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:57,367
The mystery of the violets
is solved.

733
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:02,267
My father is, um--

734
00:54:02,267 --> 00:54:05,601
My father is manager here--
at hotel.

735
00:54:05,601 --> 00:54:07,968
He's very happy
you have returned to hotel.

736
00:54:10,734 --> 00:54:14,667
He's very big admirer
of yours, madame.

737
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:18,100
He says he heard you sing
many times in Paris.

738
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,801
Please thank him.

739
00:54:34,701 --> 00:54:36,901
Paris is place
I wish I visit.

740
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,901
Would you like me to open?

741
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,601
Perhaps.

742
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Would you join me?

743
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,734
I don't...

744
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:58,367
Please?

745
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:59,767
Santรฉ.

746
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:07,000
You seem so sad.

747
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,567
No one so young
should be so sad.

748
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,801
Do you still sing?

749
00:56:19,901 --> 00:56:21,801
Hmm?

750
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,934
Never.
Mmm.

751
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:32,400
I'm sorry.

752
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:36,701
I should love
to have heard you sing.

753
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:45,434
Mmm.

754
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,267
You are too cold.

755
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,067
Surely.

756
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:04,534
No?

757
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:14,167
How can you bear it?

758
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,067
Don't know how
you can bear it.

759
00:57:45,934 --> 00:57:49,667
I'm sorry. I--
I don't see anything.

760
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:52,501
Did you see something
in the street?

761
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:02,334
Would you like me
to close the window, madame?

762
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:05,067
It is very cold.

763
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:08,501
Yes.

764
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:11,634
Please close the window.

765
00:58:22,734 --> 00:58:24,534
The manager is very happy

766
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,701
that you've returned
to the hotel.

767
00:58:26,701 --> 00:58:28,601
He remembered
your love of violets

768
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:30,100
and hopes you enjoyed them.

769
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,834
He's a great admirer
of yours, madame.

770
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:36,167
Says that he
heard you sing

771
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:38,868
many times in Paris.

772
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:43,100
Yes.

773
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,534
Please thank him.

774
00:59:12,234 --> 00:59:13,534
Artist?

775
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:16,167
Painter.

776
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:19,167
I see the paint
on your hands.

777
00:59:20,334 --> 00:59:21,834
Mm-hmm.

778
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:23,968
I'm a painter, too.

779
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:26,400
Already there's been some
serious interest, you know?

780
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
People like my stuff.

781
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,167
I mean,
they really like it.

782
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:35,133
You've been here long?

783
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:38,734
It's not easy here.

784
00:59:38,734 --> 00:59:41,734
I see things everywhere.
Don't you?

785
00:59:41,734 --> 00:59:44,701
It's all new.

786
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:47,701
On the walls,
on bridges,

787
00:59:47,701 --> 00:59:49,567
I see things.

788
00:59:49,567 --> 00:59:53,200
I get my palette
from the sky.

789
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,968
I wait, and I paint.

790
00:59:58,934 --> 01:00:01,634
Don't you think,
when you first come here,

791
01:00:01,634 --> 01:00:03,133
you come because this

792
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:06,701
is the capital
of everything possible?

793
01:00:08,868 --> 01:00:12,000
Ah, for a while,
it can be.

794
01:00:31,934 --> 01:00:34,100
I can make
the buildings dance.

795
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,934
Whole cities move
because of me.

796
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:42,234
It's how you look
at things, Teya.

797
01:00:42,234 --> 01:00:44,434
You see a city between
the buildings.

798
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:46,234
Mm-hmm.

799
01:00:46,234 --> 01:00:48,100
You see the shapes
they cut out in the sky?

800
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,167
Mm-hmm, like Mommy's teeth.

801
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,167
Oops.

802
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:00,267
That's okay.

803
01:01:00,267 --> 01:01:02,467
My umbrella's
out of control.

804
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:04,801
Boing, boing, boing.

805
01:01:04,801 --> 01:01:07,133
It's everywhere.

806
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:10,133
You like that dog?
Imagine if we were in
a huge umbrella,

807
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,801
if we were living
in a huge umbrella.

808
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,334
That would be so weird,

809
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:15,634
because then we're going
to see a green

810
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:17,367
or any color all the time.

811
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,501
Why's that squirrel
chasing the other
squirrel?

812
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:37,834
Because he loves her.

813
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:40,367
Then why is she
running away?

814
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,267
Because she's scared.

815
01:01:42,267 --> 01:01:44,000
Hmm. Can we go
to the fountain now?

816
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,801
The fountain?
I don't remember
where the fountain is.

817
01:01:49,801 --> 01:01:50,834
Do you?

818
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:54,167
Oh, no! Oh, no!

819
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,834
Mommy doesn't let me
eat hot dogs.

820
01:01:59,834 --> 01:02:01,534
You want sushi?

821
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:03,534
Seaweed's gross.

822
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:05,868
Then it's our secret, okay?

823
01:02:05,868 --> 01:02:07,467
All right.

824
01:02:32,033 --> 01:02:33,868
Bracelet fell in.

825
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:01,400
Excuse me.

826
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:03,534
Yeah?

827
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:04,734
We couldn't help but notice

828
01:03:04,734 --> 01:03:06,000
how good you are with her.

829
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,267
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

830
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:10,934
It's so unusual
to meet a manny.

831
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:13,133
And a good manny,
at that.

832
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:14,567
What?

833
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:15,968
You know, a male nanny.

834
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:22,501
Well, thank you. Thanks.

835
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,601
Excuse me.
Teya.

836
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:28,601
Tey. Come, baby.

837
01:03:28,601 --> 01:03:29,934
Let's go now.

838
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:32,901
Time to go. Come.

839
01:03:35,734 --> 01:03:38,267
The sun's a boy,
and the moon's a girl.

840
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:39,934
Exactly, Tey.

841
01:03:39,934 --> 01:03:41,434
El sol, la luna.

842
01:03:41,434 --> 01:03:43,434
La luna.
Yeah, that's right.

843
01:03:43,434 --> 01:03:45,434
I like when
they're both out.
Yeah?

844
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:47,434
They make all these
pretty colors,

845
01:03:47,434 --> 01:03:53,434
and it's kind of like
purple, hot pink
and regular pink,

846
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:57,501
and they sort of, like,
play tag with each other

847
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,901
while they still can.

848
01:04:01,467 --> 01:04:02,701
Hey, sweetness.

849
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:04,167
Hey, Mommy.

850
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:09,601
Hi.

851
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:10,734
Nice outfit.

852
01:04:10,734 --> 01:04:11,968
Did you pick that out
yourself?

853
01:04:11,968 --> 01:04:15,267
Yep. And the bracelet matches.

854
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:16,801
It does.

855
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:19,000
Ed's over there.
He's got a snack
for you.

856
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,100
No, thanks.

857
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,000
You're going to get hungry.

858
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,634
Nuh-uh. I had a hot dog.

859
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,667
You need to be firm
with her, okay?

860
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:35,300
She needs the discipline.

861
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,634
She needs you.

862
01:04:40,534 --> 01:04:43,133
She misses you.

863
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,400
Um...

864
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,701
pick her up
again tomorrow?

865
01:04:53,701 --> 01:04:56,000
Okay.

866
01:04:57,567 --> 01:04:58,501
Okay.

867
01:05:00,701 --> 01:05:03,567
Come on, monkey.

868
01:05:55,334 --> 01:05:58,033
Daddy, Daddy!

869
01:06:14,734 --> 01:06:16,634
Excuse me. All this
for dry cleaning?

870
01:06:16,634 --> 01:06:17,701
Yeah. Is tomorrow okay?

871
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:18,701
Why not?

872
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:20,767
After 5:00.

873
01:06:20,767 --> 01:06:22,767
You've been shopping.

874
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:24,234
Very expensive stuff.

875
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,000
I don't like to run out.

876
01:06:41,133 --> 01:06:43,667
Your Cantonese
is improving.

877
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:44,601
I've been studying.

878
01:06:46,801 --> 01:06:47,868
Have a nice night.

879
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:43,567
$25.

880
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:57,701
Hey, how are you today?

881
01:09:57,701 --> 01:09:59,501
Good.

882
01:09:59,501 --> 01:10:02,334
I want to paint you.

883
01:10:02,334 --> 01:10:04,133
You know, portrait.

884
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:07,200
Um, would you like--
Come with me?

885
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,434
Why me?

886
01:10:11,434 --> 01:10:13,901
I don't know.

887
01:10:16,868 --> 01:10:19,701
I really don't know.

888
01:10:23,033 --> 01:10:24,601
I can't.

889
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:27,434
Please.

890
01:10:31,534 --> 01:10:33,367
Okay. I'm sorry.

891
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:36,934
I'm going to give you
my address.

892
01:10:36,934 --> 01:10:38,567
If you change your mind...

893
01:10:42,901 --> 01:10:44,367
I'm waiting for you.

894
01:12:20,834 --> 01:12:24,467
Hey. You looking
for something?

895
01:12:24,467 --> 01:12:26,067
I looking for the painter.

896
01:12:28,133 --> 01:12:29,300
What?

897
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,901
The painter.

898
01:12:30,901 --> 01:12:33,133
The painter is dead.

899
01:12:33,133 --> 01:12:35,033
You want apartment?

900
01:13:45,567 --> 01:13:47,100
Can I help you?

901
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,100
Oh, thank you.

902
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,234
You're welcome.

903
01:13:49,234 --> 01:13:52,033
Well, I guess
this is useless.

904
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:56,801
Aren't you the one
who's always filming
in the coffee shop?

905
01:13:56,801 --> 01:13:59,734
I thought I was being
more discreet.

906
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:01,901
I guess my secret's out now.

907
01:14:01,901 --> 01:14:04,868
If you ask for permission,
you never get it, so...

908
01:14:04,868 --> 01:14:07,567
So you like to break
the rules, then?

909
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:10,033
A lot of people
give me trouble.

910
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:13,901
Well, I will be
the exception for today.

911
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:16,767
Oh. City's full
of surprises, right?

912
01:14:16,767 --> 01:14:17,701
Yeah.

913
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,801
Hey, it's me. Can we talk?

914
01:15:15,801 --> 01:15:17,234
Yeah, Peter. How are you?

915
01:15:17,234 --> 01:15:19,968
Yeah, yeah, of course.

916
01:15:19,968 --> 01:15:21,634
I'll get it to you
in the morning.

917
01:15:24,133 --> 01:15:26,267
No, they're very
important clients.

918
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:33,667
No. Losing a client
is not an option.

919
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:36,868
Shit.

920
01:15:36,868 --> 01:15:37,801
Yeah.

921
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:41,300
And?

922
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:45,467
Thank you.

923
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:48,300
No, I don't care.
Tell him to postpone
the opening.

924
01:15:51,334 --> 01:15:53,834
Yeah, yeah, of course.

925
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:56,701
And if their lawyer
tries to contact you...

926
01:16:08,467 --> 01:16:10,367
Yeah. Oh.

927
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:12,868
What do you see?

928
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:22,367
No, don't mention
the second offer.

929
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:23,634
Not yet.

930
01:16:23,634 --> 01:16:26,234
No. Okay, Peter.

931
01:16:26,234 --> 01:16:27,334
You, too. Thanks.

932
01:16:31,067 --> 01:16:34,534
You know,
this is what I've always
liked about New York--

933
01:16:34,534 --> 01:16:38,067
These little moments
on the sidewalk, smoking,

934
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:39,567
thinking about your life.

935
01:16:39,567 --> 01:16:41,868
Makes you appreciate
the city better.

936
01:16:41,868 --> 01:16:48,067
You can watch the buildings.
You can feel the air
and look at the people.

937
01:16:48,067 --> 01:16:52,400
Sometimes meet somebody
you feel like you can talk to.

938
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,067
You can talk about what?

939
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:59,267
Things you can say
to a stranger.

940
01:17:01,067 --> 01:17:06,234
You know, when there's
no past, there's no guilt.

941
01:17:06,234 --> 01:17:08,767
Have you ever made love
to a perfect stranger?

942
01:17:10,434 --> 01:17:13,767
Now you're teasing me.

943
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:17,300
I believe I am.

944
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,767
Well, I mean...

945
01:17:19,767 --> 01:17:21,767
No, not exactly
a perfect stranger,

946
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:25,968
if you mean someone
I wouldn't know at all.

947
01:17:29,434 --> 01:17:31,767
It's sad.

948
01:17:31,767 --> 01:17:34,234
It's sad? Why?

949
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:37,267
Because there's almost
nothing more exciting

950
01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:39,334
than fucking somebody
you don't know.

951
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:42,801
Right?

952
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:43,801
You don't know
their name,

953
01:17:43,801 --> 01:17:45,434
barely saw
their face.

954
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:52,968
Don't.

955
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:56,434
Don't tell me your name.

956
01:18:02,267 --> 01:18:07,267
You know what?
As soon as I finish
this cigarette,

957
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:10,167
I have to walk back
into that restaurant

958
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:12,534
and sit down again
in front of my husband.

959
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:15,100
And?

960
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,400
And he won't look at me.

961
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,701
And he won't notice
I'm not wearing a bra
under my dress.

962
01:18:21,701 --> 01:18:23,334
No bra?

963
01:18:23,334 --> 01:18:25,200
No panties, either.

964
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,133
Oh.

965
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:28,667
No underwear?

966
01:18:28,667 --> 01:18:29,801
Not today.

967
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:40,834
I feel sad for this
poor, lonely husband

968
01:18:40,834 --> 01:18:43,667
who can't see his wife's
hidden talents.

969
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:47,033
Don't you think he's like
every man, though?

970
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:50,334
He's typically
blind and bored by
his very own wife,

971
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:53,200
ready to fantasize about
the first unknown woman

972
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,868
he hasn't fucked yet.

973
01:18:57,868 --> 01:18:59,267
Am I bothering you?

974
01:19:01,868 --> 01:19:03,033
Not at all.

975
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:10,000
Yeah. And you say that because
now I've turned you on, right?

976
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:13,767
You want
to take me to bed.

977
01:19:16,234 --> 01:19:19,567
Do you want
to take me to bed?

978
01:19:19,567 --> 01:19:24,234
Yeah, I probably do.

979
01:19:24,234 --> 01:19:29,234
Aw, come on. All right,
why are you telling me
all of this?

980
01:19:29,234 --> 01:19:32,067
Because tonight
I want things
to change.

981
01:19:34,901 --> 01:19:37,234
Chain smoking's
a bad thing.

982
01:19:37,234 --> 01:19:39,534
Who knows?
Maybe we'll meet again.

983
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:11,534
Thank you.

984
01:20:12,734 --> 01:20:15,968
Enjoy your meal.

985
01:20:37,968 --> 01:20:39,868
I love you.

986
01:20:42,634 --> 01:20:44,033
I love you, too.

987
01:20:49,634 --> 01:20:50,567
Okay?

988
01:21:02,834 --> 01:21:08,667
ยง A heart that's full up ยง

989
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:12,467
ยง Like a landfill ยง

990
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:18,467
ยง A job that
slowly kills you ยง

991
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:24,300
ยง Bruises that won't heal ยง

992
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:34,033
What the hell
happened to you?

993
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:35,200
I was doing downward dog,

994
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,434
and then I went
into chakrasana,

995
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:37,934
and that's when it happened.

996
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,667
What's a downward dog?

997
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,234
Yoga.

998
01:21:42,234 --> 01:21:43,834
Oh, yeah. You know,

999
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:46,200
I remember you used to be
really loose and limber.

1000
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,934
Mr. Riccoli, can you just
fill the prescriptions now?

1001
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:50,200
I didn't mean loose like--
I know what you're saying.

1002
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,567
I just have somewhere to be.

1003
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:54,701
Right.

1004
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:59,234
Um...

1005
01:21:59,234 --> 01:22:01,367
What the hell--
Who you with?

1006
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:03,400
Birth control?
What the hell
are you doing?

1007
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,501
Oh, come on.

1008
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:06,133
No, listen,
I'm just saying that,

1009
01:22:06,133 --> 01:22:07,701
you know, I think, Lydia,

1010
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:09,934
personally it's time
for you to have babies.

1011
01:22:09,934 --> 01:22:12,300
What are you, kidding me?

1012
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,601
What's wrong with you?
I'm out of here.

1013
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:15,567
What'd I say?

1014
01:22:16,801 --> 01:22:18,601
What did I--

1015
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,601
You used to be nice.
What happened to you?

1016
01:22:20,601 --> 01:22:22,234
Whoa.

1017
01:22:24,234 --> 01:22:27,601
Hey, Lydia, come on.
Talk to me. What'd I say?

1018
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:29,534
Hey, I'm sorry.

1019
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:34,067
What the hell did I say?

1020
01:22:34,067 --> 01:22:35,234
Babies.

1021
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:41,067
You're picking on me again.

1022
01:22:41,067 --> 01:22:43,434
I just don't understand
why I'm always the one

1023
01:22:43,434 --> 01:22:45,601
who has to initiate
everything.

1024
01:22:45,601 --> 01:22:47,067
Not true.

1025
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:48,434
We don't go anywhere.

1026
01:22:48,434 --> 01:22:50,567
You don't take me
anywhere.

1027
01:22:50,567 --> 01:22:52,567
I took you to
the park last week.

1028
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,567
Come on. I'm talking about
outside of the city.

1029
01:22:54,567 --> 01:22:56,567
Name one place
in the past two years

1030
01:22:56,567 --> 01:22:59,100
outside the city that
you've taken me to.

1031
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,734
Beach in the Hamptons.

1032
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:02,567
That's where we met,
and you hated the Hamptons.

1033
01:23:02,567 --> 01:23:04,567
I'm talking about
a road trip,

1034
01:23:04,567 --> 01:23:08,267
or a canoe trip, even.
A bike trip.

1035
01:23:08,267 --> 01:23:10,300
Will you stop
with the phone?

1036
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:15,334
Just name one.

1037
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:16,367
Exactly.

1038
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:19,467
What?

1039
01:23:19,467 --> 01:23:21,701
If you could go
anywhere in the world,

1040
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:24,667
where would you go?

1041
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,467
You know where.

1042
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:29,601
Come with me.
What are you doing?

1043
01:23:29,601 --> 01:23:32,734
I just bought tickets.
We're leaving now.

1044
01:23:35,334 --> 01:23:36,434
We are?

1045
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,133
Are you out of your mind?

1046
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:41,601
I don't have anything
with me right now.

1047
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:43,834
Well, I will buy you
a toothbrush.

1048
01:23:43,834 --> 01:23:45,167
In Rome.

1049
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,267
Coach is fine.

1050
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,334
Lift your feet.

1051
01:23:56,334 --> 01:23:57,834
You don't lift
your feet.

1052
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,167
I'm lifting my feet.

1053
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,501
No, you're shuffling.

1054
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:03,167
The doctor said
you should lift
your feet.

1055
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:04,968
I'm lifting, I'm lifting.

1056
01:24:04,968 --> 01:24:08,634
You want you should fall down,
break your other hip?

1057
01:24:08,634 --> 01:24:12,167
At least then the pain would
be the same on both sides.

1058
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:16,200
Equal.
Everything always has to
be equal with you.

1059
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,667
I'm a democratic
sort of fellow.

1060
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:20,300
Well, see how
democratic you feel

1061
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,534
when you fall down
and break your other hip.

1062
01:24:22,534 --> 01:24:24,667
I'm not breaking any hips.

1063
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:27,868
Is there some place
you got to get to later?

1064
01:24:27,868 --> 01:24:30,000
What is your hurry?

1065
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,868
My hurry is
I want to get there
before next week.

1066
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:34,868
At the rate you walk...

1067
01:24:34,868 --> 01:24:36,434
You want faster?

1068
01:24:36,434 --> 01:24:40,200
Divorce me and get yourself
a younger man.

1069
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,868
Tom Cruise, perhaps.

1070
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:45,734
You think you're funny?

1071
01:24:45,734 --> 01:24:48,667
I do, as a matter of fact.

1072
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,234
Then what would you do,
Mr. Smarty-pants?

1073
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:53,534
Mr. I'm so independent,

1074
01:24:53,534 --> 01:24:56,767
I don't need any help
opening the pickle jar.

1075
01:24:56,767 --> 01:24:58,501
I got caught in a pickle.

1076
01:24:58,501 --> 01:25:03,200
You'd still be
putting on your jacket
if it wasn't for me.

1077
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,567
Go ahead, hit me,
why don't you?

1078
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:09,667
Want to run me down?

1079
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:12,767
All the time, honking like
they own the place.

1080
01:25:12,767 --> 01:25:14,234
We could have driven.

1081
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:15,567
Who could have driven? You?

1082
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:18,300
You're going to give me
a heart attack now?

1083
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,901
What's the good
of having a car

1084
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:21,701
if I never get
to drive it?

1085
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:24,267
You can't drive.
You can't even
read the street sign.

1086
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:26,267
I still have my license.

1087
01:25:26,267 --> 01:25:28,133
Only because
that girl at the DMV

1088
01:25:28,133 --> 01:25:29,267
took pity on you.

1089
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:30,801
All that flirting
with her, oh.

1090
01:25:30,801 --> 01:25:32,467
It was embarrassing.

1091
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:35,067
Brighton Beach Avenue.

1092
01:25:35,067 --> 01:25:37,734
As if you didn't know
what street this was.

1093
01:25:37,734 --> 01:25:40,234
I know what street this is.
Of course you know
what street this is.

1094
01:25:40,234 --> 01:25:43,934
You think I don't know
what street this is?
Did I say you didn't?

1095
01:25:43,934 --> 01:25:46,601
I was reading the street sign.

1096
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,267
A regular Evelyn Wood
I married.

1097
01:25:49,267 --> 01:25:51,400
Hurry up, it's green.

1098
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,868
The light's going to change.

1099
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:21,467
Step up.

1100
01:26:23,968 --> 01:26:25,300
Okay.

1101
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,834
You sure?
We're not in any rush.

1102
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:29,968
I said I'm okay.

1103
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:35,667
Don't walk so fast.

1104
01:26:35,667 --> 01:26:38,133
I don't want to have to
call an ambulance.

1105
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:42,000
I don't want to think about
trying to make that cell phone
she sent us work.

1106
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,701
Did you call her?

1107
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:44,968
She called me.

1108
01:26:44,968 --> 01:26:46,868
What did she say?
What do you think she said?

1109
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,334
"How are you? How is Dad?
What are you doing?"

1110
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:52,801
And what did you
say to her?

1111
01:26:52,801 --> 01:26:56,000
I told her we're doing
the same thing we do
every year.

1112
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,501
Good.

1113
01:26:57,501 --> 01:27:00,667
She said she sent us
a card, and did we get it.

1114
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:03,501
Did we get a card?
Did you see any card?

1115
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:07,033
Maybe it just
didn't get here yet.

1116
01:27:07,033 --> 01:27:08,300
She probably sent it late.

1117
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,367
Don't criticize.
I'm not criticizing.

1118
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:12,701
You are criticizing.

1119
01:27:12,701 --> 01:27:14,467
I'm just saying,
she probably forgot

1120
01:27:14,467 --> 01:27:16,200
and then remembered
at the last minute.

1121
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,367
You wait and see.

1122
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:19,000
The postmark
will be yesterday,

1123
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,033
as if it could get here
from France in one day.

1124
01:27:24,033 --> 01:27:25,701
Where are you going?

1125
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:27,300
I don't want
to take the ramp.

1126
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,033
Well, the ramp is easier.

1127
01:27:29,033 --> 01:27:30,200
I'll take the stairs.

1128
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,934
You're going to kill me.

1129
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:38,734
Today of all days, he decides
he'll finally kill me--

1130
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:41,067
Do away with me by making me
take the stairs.

1131
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:43,434
Give me a heart attack,

1132
01:27:43,434 --> 01:27:46,133
just watching you
take the stairs.

1133
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:49,067
They have smart police
these days,

1134
01:27:49,067 --> 01:27:51,701
like the cute one on CSI.

1135
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,400
They'll figure it out.

1136
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,734
It'll make headlines--

1137
01:27:56,734 --> 01:28:02,067
Man kills wife
on 63rd anniversary,

1138
01:28:02,067 --> 01:28:05,801
walking up stairs.

1139
01:29:25,033 --> 01:29:26,133
Hey, hey!

1140
01:29:26,133 --> 01:29:27,167
Hoodlums!

1141
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:31,033
They ought to arrest them.

1142
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:33,167
Let's go have lunch.

1143
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,167
Let's go. Come on.

1144
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:35,334
Let's go.

1145
01:29:35,334 --> 01:29:36,968
I'm coming,
I'm coming.

1146
01:29:38,167 --> 01:29:39,501
Lift your feet.

1147
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:40,968
I'm lifting.
No, you're shuffling.

1148
01:29:40,968 --> 01:29:44,033
Lift your feet. Lift.
I'm lifting, I'm lifting.

1149
01:29:44,033 --> 01:29:44,968
All right. Come on.

1150
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:51,000
I fixed your hat
a little bit.

1151
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,067
You're looking okay
with your hat.

1152
01:29:53,067 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah.

1153
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,834
Looking pretty
good-looking to me.

1154
01:30:27,901 --> 01:30:29,567
Look at me.

1155
01:30:29,567 --> 01:30:31,133
Look at me.

1156
01:30:31,133 --> 01:30:34,067
I look terrible.

1157
01:30:34,067 --> 01:30:37,234
I don't understand
what happened.

1158
01:30:37,234 --> 01:30:41,167
Happened. What happened?

1159
