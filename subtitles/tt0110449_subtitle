1
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,994
"never could cross ..."

2
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,231
"... the distance ..."

3
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,502
"... of streets"

4
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,518
"A thousand times ..."

5
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,622
"... I hesitated"

6
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,623
"only to re-start again"

7
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,224
"Who knows the earth..."

8
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,229
"... of one's land?"

9
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,512
"I walked with dirt
in my eyes..."

10
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,513
"... and a cloud of dust
over my heart"

11
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,267
"Izoo, you're up very
early today, son?"

12
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,544
some tea?

13
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,545
We'll have it together
at the table.

14
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
"What were you writing,
early morning?"

15
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,846
Granny.

16
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,847
Where would Mammo Nani be?

17
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,523
Who knows if she is alive?

18
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,524
I pray for her every day.
May she be well.

19
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,263
How come you thought of
her all of a sudden?

20
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,033
I dreamt of her last night.

21
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,371
Poor thing.

22
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,372
She was never a burden
on anyone.

23
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,977
I wish ...

24
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,978
We had done more to keep
her with us.

25
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,917
When Ahmedbhai died...

26
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,918
.... there was no one to care
for her in this entire world.

27
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,989
So many letters from her

28
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,491
I never replied to even one.

29
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,492
Where is there place
in such small flats.

30
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,830
My silence must have wounded
her very deeply.

31
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,502
Do you still have
those letters?

32
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,843
Can I see them?

33
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,247
Just a moment.

34
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,204
Here.

35
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,824
Since Ahmedbhai died I have
no one to call my own.

36
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,830
I am totally alone.

37
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,833
I wish to come to you.

38
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,003
"Rest assured,
I won't bother you."

39
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,841
I will cook for you.

40
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,243
Sweep and swab for you.

41
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,244
Take care of your grand-son.

42
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,514
Please send for me.

43
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,197
"What are you staring at,
child?"

44
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,198
Pick up the luggage.
Go on!

45
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,802
"You are Riyaz, ye ?"

46
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,906
How you've grown!

47
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,907
"God be praised,
just like your mother!"

48
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,212
May she rest in peace.

49
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,482
The same innocent
face she had.

50
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,487
"When I came last,
you were that small."

51
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,324
You played on my lap.

52
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,493
I've cleaned your bottom.

53
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,494
I don't remember.
- listen to that.

54
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,499
Forgotten your Mammo Nani.

55
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
I've grown fatter.
- like a cow !

56
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,508
But our Fejji must
be the same.

57
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,610
Slim and fit.

58
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,611
Where is your granny?
Fejji?

59
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,115
In the kitchen?

60
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,116
"Who is it, Rizoo?
- Granny, some-one's come"

61
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,787
"Some-one ? It's me, Mammo!"

62
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,209
You could've sent a telegram.
At least a letter.

63
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,980
What's the use.

64
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,981
I wrote many letters and
got no reply

65
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
You were worried I'd take
over your house.

66
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,825
"Fejji, how much does a
poor old woman need?"

67
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,994
A corner somewhere.

68
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,837
"Rizoo, get some sherbet
for your Mammo Nani."

69
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,241
No sherbet-verbet.
What I need is a hot bath.

70
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,545
My clothes are filthy
from the journey.

71
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,546
"Rizoo, go fill a bucket
with hot water."

72
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,184
He's quite forgotten me.

73
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,185
Doesn't recognize me
or even greet me.

74
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,455
"Rizoo, you didn't wish
your Mammo Nani."

75
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,460
Live long !Be happy!
May God guide you.

76
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,799
I used to worry how you'd cope
with your orphaned grand-son.

77
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,970
Tell us about you.

78
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,306
It's a long story.
- What happened?

79
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,477
I never went to see those
dreadful people again.

80
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,813
Tell me all the same.

81
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,215
You'll hear it all.
What's the hurry.

82
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,216
"We have our lives ahead of us.
The water ready, son?"

83
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,825
I'll make the tea.

84
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,826
How will I open this
on my own ?

85
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,496
Come here quickly

86
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,439
Open this.
Good!

87
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,176
"So, you've forgotten me ..."

88
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,548
.... but I have not...

89
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,183
.... I often thought of you
over there.

90
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,184
Do you know where I was
all these years ?

91
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,187
"Very far from here.
- Yes, in Pakistan."

92
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,792
Your grand-uncle took
me there.

93
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,195
He broke my ties
with my dear ones.

94
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,466
"But, see, I'm back."

95
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,204
"To be with you,
forever!"

96
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,205
"Granny, how long will she stay?
- Why?"

97
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,076
She says she will stay
here forever.

98
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,316
"What can I do, son.
Throw her out?"

99
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,484
Poor thing has no one
but us.

100
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,220
no one even to bury her.

101
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,221
You have no regard for others.

102
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,225
Listen. From tonight Mammo Nani
will sleep in your room.

103
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,331
My room?

104
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,232
"Just you see, I'll fail
in my exams."

105
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,335
She'll not let me study
yakking all the time.

106
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,336
She'll chew my brains.
- She is my sister.

107
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,007
She's come to stay
and she will stay.

108
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,509
Do you want me to top
the class?

109
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,510
Or remain a doffer.
What is it you want?

110
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,513
Quiet - she'll hear you.

111
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,371
What are you doing there?
Won't you have some tea?

112
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,275
"So, tell me what happened?"

113
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,546
What shall I say?
They treated me like a dog.

114
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,285
But you always said Ahmedbhai
treated you so well.

115
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,226
The day he passed away
everything changed.

116
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,232
He married me against
his family's wishes.

117
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,837
Not having children
was excuse enough.

118
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,838
My sister-in-law turned
me into a servant.

119
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,841
"Come now,
you always exaggerate."

120
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,844
Why would I lie to you?

121
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,014
How they tortured me.

122
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,254
One day I was hanging out
the wash ...

123
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,259
They flung a big stone at me.

124
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,260
Hit me right on my temple.
See. It left a scar.

125
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,865
Why didn't you write?

126
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,034
What could you have done ?

127
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,537
I went straight
to the police.

128
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,273
They just laughed and said ...

129
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,875
.... family quarrels should be
settled at home!

130
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,044
They were all against me.

131
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,045
Riyaz, your tea
is getting cold.

132
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,551
I fled from there.

133
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,487
And went to a mosque
close by and stayed there.

134
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,488
Every day I'd do the rounds
of the Indian Consulate.

135
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,993
Finally I managed
a three month Visa.

136
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,496
And came directly to you.

137
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,497
Why are you both
looking so glum?

138
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,234
"I'm not dead, am l?
I'm alive and kicking."

139
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,238
"Fejji, smile!"

140
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,341
Why are you making a face?
This is time for fun.

141
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,247
Why must I laugh?
I'm not in the mood.

142
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,851
You remember our neighbor?
- Yes. Mushtaque.

143
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,024
"Fejji, this old photo?
When did you get it framed?"

144
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,530
How lovely we three looked?

145
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,534
What days they were!
- See Anwari's hair style.

146
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,980
Rizoo, reduce the volume.

147
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,983
My fish need music
to digest their food.

148
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,989
Have you told Anwari?
- No.

149
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,826
When I reached Delhi station
I wanted to meet Anwari.

150
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,930
But that husband of hers ...

151
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,931
.... he would have slammed
the door on me.

152
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,238
What news of that cobbler?

153
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,239
By God's grace
he is doing well.

154
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,342
Exporting goods as
far as America.

155
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,014
"Only shoes!
A cobbler, after all."

156
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,015
So what if he's a millionaire.

157
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,519
"Mammo, you still chew paan
just as much as you used to."

158
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,357
Shall I make you one?
- Less time and no tobacco.

159
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,029
I know!

160
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,030
Tobacco is bad
for your health.

161
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,369
My husband got me
into the habit.

162
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,370
Now he's gone
bless his soul.

163
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,473
It's an expensive habit.
- Difficult to get in Pakistan.

164
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,813
While he was alive
I was never in need.

165
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,483
Say what you like
he was a good man.

166
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,822
Do they still show Indian
films in Pakistan?

167
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,827
No - that's the one thing
I hankered for.

168
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,830
Our films don't get there
but they make their own.

169
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,337
But not like the old days.
- Not at all!

170
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,240
"Noor Jehan, Dilip Kumar!"

171
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,508
There's a new singer there.
- Iqbal Banu.

172
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,509
Wonderful voice.

173
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,014
Qateel Shifai's lyrics.
- Excellent.

174
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,016
Don't you want to sleep?

175
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,017
If you talk all night
how will I sleep?

176
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,020
I have school tomorrow.
- Put out the lights.

177
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,524
"Good night, Rizoo."

178
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,468
"God, you are benevolent."

179
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,469
You are merciful.
You pardon all our sins.

180
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,206
"Lord, may my late husband's
soul rest in peace."

181
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,977
"God, please punish
those wicked people."

182
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,216
Who tormented me and
rendered me homeless.

183
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,217
"God, you are kindness itself."

184
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,489
I thank you a
million times over ...

185
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,490
for bringing me together
with my sister and family.

186
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,826
"Take pity on my Fayazi,
Riyaz and on my sorrows."

187
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,598
Protect them from misfortune
and safeguard me.

188
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,599
"Give my Riyaz prosperity,
wealth and fame."

189
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,336
"Make him a doctor, an engineer
or a government official."

190
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,509
Come and see
what she has done.

191
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,611
She has spread her clothes
all over the balcony.

192
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,913
Even on my fish tank.

193
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,249
"Son, must you complain
first thing in the morning."

194
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,250
Everyone has to adjust.
- Adjust! Adjust!

195
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,455
First she has
taken over my bed.

196
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,857
If I don't study now
will I not fail?

197
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,794
I'm fed up with your
endless chattering.

198
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,463
You only think of yourself?

199
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,565
One day I will leave
everything and go away.

200
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,566
Where will you go?
- Wherever I get some peace.

201
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,314
"Granny, where's my lunch box?"

202
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,818
"Son, eat in the canteen today.
- Why?"

203
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,821
"I've not cooked - Mammo
Nani's here, that's why."

204
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,824
Wait - I'll make another
toast for you.

205
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,227
I'll miss my bus.
- Just wait.

206
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,832
Who'll go with me to the
police registration office?

207
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,235
"Rizoo will.
Accompany Mammo Nani, son."

208
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,242
Today is physics.
How can I miss that

209
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,012
Why don't you go along?
- You gone mad ?

210
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,013
Go alone to the police?

211
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,452
"Slow down, please."

212
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,789
Why make me run?

213
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,794
"Lord, what a city."

214
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,296
Such filth as well.

215
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,297
"Had you seen Lahore!
Such wide roads, bungalows ..."

216
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,303
Green trees.
imported cars going zip-zip.

217
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,476
If its so wonderful
why did you come here?

218
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,477
It's all that but there's
nothing like one's own country.

219
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,481
It was your own wish.

220
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,220
You get to be older
and you'll understand...

221
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,221
that the scent of one's own
country is something wonderful.

222
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,784
This is the Visa office.
Your name?

223
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,785
Mehmooda Begum Ahmed Ali.

224
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,791
Go and meet the officer.

225
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,801
Sit there.

226
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,812
Here for the first time?

227
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,983
From where?
I am from Lahore.

228
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,984
"No, I'm from Hyderabad Sindh.
- You must have relatives here?"

229
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,822
I am staying with my sister.
This is my grandson.

230
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,826
May god protect him.
He's a capable child.

231
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,831
He studies in an
English school.

232
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,832
His mother died
when he was a baby.

233
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,937
She died in a road accident.

234
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,938
These bus drivers...
- Silence! This is no public garden.

235
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,876
It's a government office.
Sit quietly.

236
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,779
Go you've been called.

237
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,454
"Greetings, officer sahib."

238
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,958
That's my name.
How are you?

239
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,201
How long are you
staying in Bombay?

240
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,970
You see I am staying
with my sister.

241
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,971
"This is my grandson,
my sister Fayazis grandson."

242
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,975
Wish the officer!

243
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,480
His granny is very ill.

244
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,481
I will need to stay at
least three months.

245
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:49,218
They all say the same things.

246
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,821
Live long - be happy
May your children prosper.

247
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,226
How many children do you have?
- Three

248
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,227
May they all become police
officers like their father.

249
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,000
All three are daughters.
- And so ?

250
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,001
Girls are more caring than boys.
Isn't that so?

251
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,841
Forgive me for taking up
your valuable time.

252
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,251
Where are you going?
- To walk the boy to school.

253
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,021
But what's the location?
- St Aloysius Academy.

254
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,261
And where do you live?
- Zilla Sultanpur.

255
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,367
I could tell from your
accent that you're from UP.

256
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,538
I am from Panipat.

257
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,539
It used to be in Punjab
and now is in Haryana.

258
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,542
Have you land in Sultanpur?
- A small one.

259
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,547
It's been divided
many times over.

260
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,284
How was your crop this year?
Did it rain or not?

261
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,387
There were floods
the crop was ruined.

262
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,494
Your wife and children?
Are they with you?

263
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,495
They are in the village
with my mother.

264
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,832
Someone has to take care
of family elders.

265
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,504
That is true.

266
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,505
How much do you
earn per day?

267
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,242
On a good day
some fifty-sixty rupees.

268
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,247
How much can you send
back home on that?

269
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,248
Stop here.

270
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,352
"Is it here, your school?
- Yes."

271
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,353
Your school is impressive!

272
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,529
Are these your friends?
- Call them.

273
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,530
It'll get late.

274
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,537
Why so late ?
You missed the first period.

275
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,874
No matter.
- Who was that?

276
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,378
How should I know?

277
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,280
She offered me a lift
and I took it.

278
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,281
Strange looking lady.
- Is she your governess?

279
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,985
"Very bad, taking lifts
from governess."

280
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,822
Who is she then?
- A relative of granny's.

281
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,227
Why not say so ? Idiot.

282
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,496
One of your close relatives?

283
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,497
Don't go by her looks.
She's a very rich lady.

284
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,234
Comes every year to
experience the monsoon.

285
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,504
She watches the rain from
her car on Marine Drive.

286
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,841
She has over 100 cars.
She's forever traveling.

287
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,846
"London, Paris, Tokyo,
Timbuctoo."

288
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,847
Then why was she in a taxi?
Her Mercedes went for servicing.

289
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,251
"New model, with an A.C.
And she owns that taxi."

290
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,856
She owns more than 20 taxis.

291
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,857
Don't bluff.
Never seen her before.

292
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,531
I've got an idea.
Let's bunk after lunch.

293
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,037
And go to a matinée.
- You two go.

294
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,373
Kazi is going to
revise 1857 today.

295
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,275
"Rohan, are you coming?
Its the last day for "Psycho"."

296
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,977
That's for Adults.

297
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,813
Haven't you seen
A films before?

298
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,216
Forget it.
We have to do 1857.

299
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,217
You can't forgo the first
freedom war for Hitch cock?

300
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,822
Call yourself a film buff?

301
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,823
We'll go.

302
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,267
Lucky - we've got tickets.

303
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Wait on the side.

304
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,490
Where are you two going?
- We have tickets.

305
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,326
This picture is not for children.
- We are not children.

306
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,495
Trying to be clever?
Shall I call the police?

307
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,496
Go from here!

308
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,842
You're back early today?

309
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,849
I came to keep the bag.

310
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,850
We have sports practice.
I have to go back.

311
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,856
Did you eat something?

312
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:14,476
"Nani, can I have some money?"

313
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,815
How much?
- Twenty or Twenty five.

314
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,816
I don't have that much. I'll get it
tomorrow from the bank.

315
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,987
I have it.

316
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,222
Why should you?
Spoiling the child.

317
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,925
You're too much!
I'm living at your place ...

318
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,926
Eating my fill here
I can't give this much?

319
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,337
You two aren't going out?

320
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,239
No.
- Why?

321
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,240
I just asked.

322
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
You're a genius
- Mammo Nani has her uses.

323
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,011
You took Mammo's burkha?

324
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,114
You gave him your burkha.
- No.

325
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,186
You took it for something?

326
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,455
Yes. We rehearsed
a school play.

327
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,957
You said you had
sport's practice.

328
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,958
The rehearsal came later.

329
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,462
So you like acting?

330
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,465
Our Zubeida too loved acting.

331
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,470
She wanted to be a heroine.

332
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,471
Your grandpa was
a studio manager.

333
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,807
He took me one day to
Shantaram filming.

334
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,212
What an eye Shantaram had.

335
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,314
Seeing Zubeida he said.

336
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,217
You will have a heroine's
role in my film.

337
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,218
"What was that film's name?
"Suraag" or "Suhaag"?"

338
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,990
Girls from good families
don't act in films.

339
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,495
That's why she was married
off early.

340
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,233
She was not yet sixteen.

341
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,934
That's why your grandma
married her to that scoundrel.

342
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,103
You'd do the same
were she your daughter.

343
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,838
I'd never do that.

344
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,839
To harm the young for
one's own needs is a sin...

345
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,343
Stop it. What I did
was right.

346
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,949
What was right about it?

347
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,452
You pushed your daughter
into a dark well.

348
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,453
"Uncaringly, you married her
to that useless fellow."

349
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,958
"Riyaz, such things are not
for you to hear."

350
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,959
Change your clothes.

351
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,468
You sleep in your room today.

352
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,469
I will sleep here.

353
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,806
Don't talk that way of
his father in front of him.

354
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,976
Don't talk what way?

355
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,813
As if you've told me
everything about my father.

356
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,814
What is there to tell?
He married your mother.

357
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,317
Two years later they both
died in a car accident.

358
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,988
You've said he's dead?

359
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,989
How will you know what I've
gone through to raise him.

360
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,829
How long can you hide
the truth?

361
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,941
"Tease not my heart"

362
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,784
"O, my dearest"

363
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,516
What's burning?

364
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,020
"Smoking, are you?"

365
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,021
You'll burn your hand.
Give it to me.

366
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,533
"Why do you have these fish?
Set them free, son."

367
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,538
Go and throw them in the sea.

368
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,041
The bigger fish will eat them.

369
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,042
Do you know fish in tanks
live longer?

370
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,879
You call it living
being in a prison?

371
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,883
"What was the play for which
you took my "burkha"?"

372
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,287
"The Old Maid of Panipat"

373
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,491
What!
- These days there are plays like.

374
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,828
"The Thug Of Delhi".
"The Dandy of Banaras"

375
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,234
Who wrote it?

376
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,235
No. Our teacher.
The librarian.

377
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,239
That's commendable.

378
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,240
What is its plot?
- Plot?

379
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,010
The story.
- What happens is ...

380
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,849
.... a man runs a guest-house
with his mother ...

381
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,852
".... known as the
"Haunted Mansion"."

382
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,356
Because whoever goes
to stay there disappears!

383
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,028
One day a girl goes
to stay there.

384
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,864
She comes to know there's
something strange going on.

385
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,033
And so her life
is in danger.

386
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,034
She realizes that the man
is the murderer.

387
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,271
"Later, he buries the bodies
in his mansion."

388
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,975
And his mother was
actually dead.

389
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,544
He keeps her body
in a chair.

390
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,281
With whom he talks.

391
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,282
God protect us.
What kind of story is this?

392
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,818
And your school authorities
have it performed by kids?

393
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,489
What kind of school is this?

394
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,824
I will talk to your head
master tomorrow.

395
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,093
No!
He never meets people.

396
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,496
His father too will meet me.
I'll tell him straight.

397
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,497
"I'll also say that from
now on, no plays for you."

398
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,833
I'll give it up myself.
But please don't go to my school.

399
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,938
What use just giving up
acting in plays?

400
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,507
Your school should not be
staging such plays at all.

401
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:24,942
"I'll accompany you tomorrow,
no matter what."

402
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,943
There is no such play!
I made it all up just now.

403
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,348
Made it up?
Why?

404
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,519
I went with Rohan to
to see an A movie.

405
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,258
Wearing your burkha.

406
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,259
It's the story of that film.

407
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,263
So?

408
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,866
Our boy is growing up.

409
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,271
Sees movies secretly
he should not be seeing.

410
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,042
Smokes cigarettes
which he should not be doing.

411
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,478
"What else do you do, Rizoo?"

412
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,479
Nothing.
- Not asleep yet.

413
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,816
I'm reading my prayers.

414
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,320
You won't tell Nani
will you?

415
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,851
"Allah, our Lord,
You are the Merciful."

416
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,258
"Protect us, grant us wealth,
respect and fame."

417
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,269
Why are you offering
prayers here?

418
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,205
Where else can l?
In the balcony ?

419
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,206
No. If you should fail
it will be on my head.

420
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,914
You should stand first.
Become a doctor or...

421
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,483
.... an engineer.
- No.

422
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,219
I will write books.
Be a writer.

423
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,220
What will you live on then?

424
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,491
Sees movies all the time
with that useless Rohan.

425
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,828
Never listens to me.
- Let him become a writer!

426
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,834
Don't encourage him.
- How am I doing that?

427
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,835
Let him do
what he wants to.

428
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,239
Why do you two
fight all the time?

429
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,508
Who's fighting?

430
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,844
Where's that Shantabai?

431
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,845
She always arrives on Sundays
when the water taps dry up.

432
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,849
What is there to wash up?
I'll do it.

433
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,854
What can you manage?
Sit and chew your paan.

434
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,357
Started again?

435
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,358
I want to help with the housework.
She won't let me.

436
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,198
"l want to contribute to the
expenses, she won't have it."

437
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,300
By selling your jewelry ?
No need.

438
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,969
I am not that destitute.

439
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,472
I can teach girls
the Quran.

440
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,473
As I did when I stayed
at the Lahore mosque.

441
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,478
Who'll learn from you?
Let it be.

442
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,479
God has given me enough
to care for three people.

443
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,821
"Shantabai, what happened?"

444
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,825
Nothing. I fell.
- And that causes these bruises.

445
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,498
Your husband must
have beaten you.

446
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,000
Why can't you spit on him
and leave.

447
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:40,001
Where will I go?
My fate is such...

448
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:43,004
Will you keep wailing
or do some work?

449
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:46,107
Hurry - the water will stop.

450
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,512
Why do you want to be
familiar with servants.

451
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,256
"Granny, Anwari Nani is
calling from Delhi."

452
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,798
Greetings.

453
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,799
How are you?
And the children?

454
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,474
Mammo is here.
Talk to her.

455
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:24,979
How are you?

456
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,485
With God's grace
I am alive.

457
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,491
Alright.
How long will you stay?

458
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:40,495
Where will she stay? Ask.
- Will you stay with us?

459
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,505
"Okay, convey my greetings too."

460
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,346
The line is cut.

461
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,249
What did she say?
When is she coming?

462
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,250
The Twenty fifth.
There is a meeting at Sabir's.

463
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,188
They'll stay
at the South End.

464
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,189
This time raise the issue
of our house.

465
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,795
No use. What can she do.
It's all in Sabir's hands.

466
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,969
What's this ?
Anwari is our sister.

467
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,570
We have our rights
along with her.

468
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,571
She is not the same Anwari.

469
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,822
See the cobbler's style!

470
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,823
She'll hear.

471
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,228
This is it.

472
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,833
"Talk of the money, Fejji.
- We'll see."

473
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,836
The opportunity should arise.

474
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,277
They're here.
Talk properly before them.

475
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,779
Don't get carried away.
- Okay.

476
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,780
Comb your hair properly.

477
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:09,183
Come in.

478
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,186
How tall you've grown.

479
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,794
My eyes were yearning
to see you.

480
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,797
I was sorry to hear
about Ahmedbhai.

481
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,807
Please be seated.

482
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,484
How are you?
- Fine. God's grace

483
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,488
Why are you standing there?
Come here.

484
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,492
Greetings.
- Come sit by me.

485
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,933
How are you?

486
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,934
What have you done to your hair?
- I've applied henna.

487
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,173
It's only applied after Haj.

488
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,443
-Is your time up, then?
- Really, that's enough.

489
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,448
I thought you were
hiding your age.

490
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,449
If I didn't look young
he'll get another right away.

491
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:17,452
Where will one find
a good looker like you?

492
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,888
You didn't bring
the children?

493
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,889
They're not children anymore.
Each one is now independent.

494
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,461
Salma is about to deliver.

495
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,796
Haroon is studying in America.

496
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,299
And to be married on
the night of id.

497
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,300
What class are you in?
- Ninth.

498
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,204
He comes first every year.

499
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,308
"What will you study in
college, science or commerce."

500
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,478
I will write books
be an author.

501
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,981
How will that help you?
It won't fill your belly.

502
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,485
It's fine as a hobby.
At one time I recited verse too.

503
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,489
The wetness of tears
makes the ground a field.

504
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,492
The baptism of fire
makes gold into a jewel.

505
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,828
"Tea, coffee, cold drink?
Shall I order pastries?"

506
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,000
A cup of tea will do.

507
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,503
Let's go home.
We'll eat together.

508
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,504
I've made Pasande.
- Some other time.

509
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,842
What will you have?

510
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,013
Beer?

511
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:20,014
"Shame on you,
Giving alcohol to a child?"

512
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,518
Beer is not alcohol. I used
to drink beer with his father.

513
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:27,522
Stop all that.
I'll place the order.

514
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,041
And some pastries

515
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,049
"So stylish, our Anwari."

516
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,054
Since when did you
start this pot-tea?

517
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,055
Don't tease. We are meeting
after so many years.

518
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,994
"Mammo Baji,
how long are you here ?"

519
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,497
As long as God
and my Visa permits.

520
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,498
I almost forgot.
Where are the keys?

521
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,501
The suitcase is open.

522
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,012
What do you read?

523
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,013
Khalil Gibran.

524
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,644
"Mammo Baji, for you."

525
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,645
"This tape-recorder,
for you."

526
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,984
Anwari you've gone mad.
I'll wear silk at my age?

527
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,222
Why can't you wear?

528
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,223
"What need for all this,
Anwari."

529
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,495
You must not give children
such expensive gifts.

530
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,001
There's no one greater
than children.

531
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:21,002
"Fejji, you were to ask
Anwari about something."

532
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,239
What?
- She's just talking nonsense.

533
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,844
Nonsense ?
You were going to ask ...

534
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,848
What happened to
the Panipat house ?

535
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,518
What a house that was.

536
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,021
The likes of it
do not exist today.

537
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:41,022
Nothing's left now.
It's an ice factory now.

538
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,861
That's true.
What about our money?

539
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,263
Fayazi and I also
have a share in it.

540
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,264
You'd get your share had
your father not left debts.

541
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,636
He died leaving debts
amounting to thousands.

542
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,271
Selling the mansion
did not cover it.

543
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,041
"l paid 22,000 from
my pocket towards it."

544
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,042
I have explained everything.
- And she swallowed all of it.

545
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,479
God forbid that I'd steal
from my own sisters.

546
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,816
"That too, after Haj?
- I said earlier do not ask."

547
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,322
"Anyway, you're lying."

548
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,424
Do I not know you ? Since
childhood you've been ...

549
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,826
".... a lying, selfish,
and confirmed thief."

550
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:19,827
Your husband Sabir
is two steps ahead of you.

551
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:24,498
Quiet ! You're just a child.
These rich folk are all devils.

552
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,504
They ate away our inheritance.

553
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,505
I was in Pakistan and my
stupid sister kept dumb.

554
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,510
But I'll not keep quiet.

555
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,512
Don't I know where
our share went?

556
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,513
This witch gave it to this cobbler
for his shoe factory.

557
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,852
"Anwari, our share is
over 100,000."

558
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,254
Give it in god's name
the plague will hit you.

559
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,255
She's gone crazy ...

560
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,860
Can't face decent people.

561
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,529
"Riyaz, take this mad
old woman away."

562
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,530
It's you who is mad.

563
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,533
Forget my share if you will
but give Fejji hers.

564
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,473
She has starved in order
to raise him.

565
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,209
Why ? His father does not
provide for his food?

566
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,978
Don't you know?
My father's dead...

567
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,979
Dead ? Who said so?

568
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,983
He's well and alive.
Enjoying life with his second wife

569
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,221
It's a lie.

570
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,323
"Granny, Didn't mother and
father die in an accident?"

571
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,226
Making us the liars?
- You are all liars!

572
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:26,227
You are all liars!
Cheats.

573
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,830
You're just a child.
Don't behave this way.

574
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,833
This is between us sisters.
Why do you interfere.

575
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,505
"Liars, all of you. I don't
want to see your faces ever."

576
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,506
"l hate you all.
- Riyaz, take your gift."

577
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,243
The tape recorder.
- I don't want anything.

578
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,246
Don't be so anxious.
He'll return.

579
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,253
I am scared.
He may do anything.

580
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,190
Had you told him earlier
this may not have happened.

581
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,195
What could I tell him?

582
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,898
Zubeida was still warm
in her grave ...

583
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,900
.... and his father remarried.

584
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,901
Abandoning his month-old son
to my care.

585
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,808
Hiding the truth during
his childhood was okay.

586
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,809
"But now he's older, aware.
He'd understand."

587
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,980
You saw how he reacted?
But how will you understand?

588
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,820
"Had you children, you would."

589
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,821
"God, please bring back Rizoo."

590
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,827
Should I phone the police?

591
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,828
"No, no. God knows
where my Rizoo is."

592
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Return home!

593
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,218
Why are you here
so late at night?

594
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,219
Go home.

595
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:41,322
Go and sleep.

596
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,449
Where did you go ?
We were so worried.

597
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,186
What do you care
if I live or die?

598
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,458
Have you eaten?
You must be hungry.

599
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,196
I don't want to eat.

600
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,197
I won't talk to you.

601
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,800
Go and sleep.
All should be well by morning.

602
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:58,499
"l said, I won't eat."

603
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,502
"Eat, son. You haven't had
anything since morning."

604
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,173
Even your anger
must be hungry.

605
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,178
Fejji too hasn't had a
morsel.

606
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,781
She's been crying
since the morning.

607
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,782
I'd have sorted you out
with two slaps.

608
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,954
Why did she lie?

609
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,855
Why didn't she
tell me about Father?

610
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,856
"So she didn't. But think, why.
Because of you."

611
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,965
That a small child
should not be hurt.

612
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,801
I know all that.
I'm no child.

613
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,802
I know everything.
Granny hates my dad.

614
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,073
That's why she said
he was dead.

615
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,976
But why should she hate him?
What did he do?

616
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,977
Ask your granny that.

617
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,214
She lies so
what can she say.

618
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,215
I will never forgive her
Not even when I die.

619
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,318
What are you babbling ?
All this talk of death.

620
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,490
I'd like to write to my dad
to say I want to meet him.

621
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,493
I want his address.
- I don't know about that.

622
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,830
If you want the address
ask Granny yourself.

623
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,501
You know that I'm not
talking to her.

624
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,502
"You ask her and tell me.
- Okay, I'll ask her."

625
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:14,241
You will write but what
will he do with you?

626
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,847
That's my business.

627
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,848
"Okay, what do I have
to do with it."

628
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,852
You're grown up now.
Do as you wish.

629
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,857
Not smoking today?
- No.

630
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,362
Don't if you like
but I'd like to.

631
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,866
You'll smoke?
- Yes.

632
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,540
Light it.

633
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,824
"Have you smoked before?
- In secret, like you."

634
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,828
Your grandpa thought servants
were stealing his cigarettes.

635
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:17,004
He smoked with great style.

636
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,245
Let's begin.

637
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:54,041
What are you doing?
- I'm making Rizoo's breakfast.

638
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:55,978
You rest for today.

639
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,646
He won't eat food
cooked by someone else.

640
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,982
Let him taste
what I prepare.

641
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,984
He'll be licking
his fingers.

642
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,985
Ahmedbhai invited special
friends for my biryani.

643
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,492
You aren't dressed for school?

644
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,996
"Mammo Nani, tell her."

645
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,997
I'm not talking to her
nor will I go to school.

646
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,502
Then what will you do?

647
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,503
"What's that to her?
Mammo Nani, tell her."

648
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:26,006
You mustn't talk like that
If you don't study ...

649
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,511
.... then who will take of
two old women like us?

650
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,613
Who else do
we have but you?

651
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,615
I won't go to school.

652
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,616
"Mammo, make him understand
or I'll throw him out."

653
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:37,353
That's fine. I'm going.

654
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,922
Where are you going ?
Stop this insane boy.

655
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,624
Or he may do something.

656
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,026
Then how will I face Zubeida
on judgment day?

657
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,529
I've no intention to die-
I'm going to the terrace.

658
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,530
"Mammo Nani, send my
breakfast there."

659
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:55,035
"Where will he go - after all,
he's that rogue's offspring."

660
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,540
Why think of abuses now ?
Had you only told him.

661
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,877
Take rest for one day.

662
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:04,878
Rest. That is not
written in my fate.

663
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,216
Are you angry even with me?
- Do I have that right?

664
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,822
What is the matter?

665
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,823
You think I should have
told him about his father.

666
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,994
I have loved him more
than a mother or father.

667
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,233
Did I say that he didn't?
- You didn't?

668
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,904
That ingrate never turned
his head ...

669
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:31,240
to see if his son was
dead or alive.

670
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,241
I have raised him
with great difficulty.

671
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,244
Now he won't even talk
to me - look at him!

672
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,516
And you are making my
wounds hurt more.

673
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:43,352
How am I doing that?
- What else ?

674
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,353
Instead of curbing him
you bait him further?

675
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,523
I understand that you have
given your life to him.

676
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,529
I don't need your certificate.

677
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,530
The egg has burned!
Move away.

678
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,202
You are so unpredictable.

679
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,971
Hot and bothered one moment
and cool the next!

680
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,972
Want to butter something then
do that to the toast. Not to me.

681
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:13,213
There you are.

682
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,832
Are you feeling okay?

683
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,503
You've bunked school
for ten days.

684
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,504
Don't want to top again?

685
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:41,241
Meaning.
- I'm sick of school. Maybe ...

686
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,846
.... I should take up a job.
- You're great.

687
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,849
Don't you know even a peon
has to pass his Metric.

688
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,253
"So, you'll polish
shoes at VT Station?"

689
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:53,856
What's wrong with that?

690
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,258
I know why you talk this way.

691
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,260
You've found out
about your dad.

692
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,962
Who told you that?
- Mammo Nani.

693
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,963
How dare she ? She has
no right to interfere.

694
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,468
She sent you?
- I'm only trying to help.

695
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,469
I don't need your bloody help.
Leave me alone. Go away.

696
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,254
"Mammo Nani, tell her
to stop this noise."

697
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,791
My fish will go crazy.

698
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:08,295
If only your fish could
teach you some sense like Jenas.

699
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,812
"Riyaz, are you deaf?
Answer the phone."

700
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,817
Why aren't you answering?

701
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,500
Rohan ? Have you no work?
You just left from here.

702
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,945
"What's it?
- I'm sorry,..."

703
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,248
whatever happened was not right.

704
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,249
You're a strange one
don't tell anyone anything?

705
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:05,385
I am what I am.
You know me.

706
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:08,455
"Anyway, I'm sorry.
I shouted at you."

707
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,960
What happened at school?
- Too bad you bunked.

708
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:14,961
We did the Lady Macbeth
speech today.

709
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:18,465
I've learnt that already.
What else?

710
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,204
Nothing.
What are you doing?

711
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,306
Reading Khalil Gibran.
- Never heard of him.

712
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,209
Because you're an ass.
He's a poet.

713
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,210
He's a super poet
from Lebanon.

714
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:33,213
Want to hear a poem?

715
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:37,217
Life is an island
In an ocean of loneliness.

716
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,987
An island
whose rocks are hopes.

717
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:44,491
Its trees are dreams.
Whose flowers are subtle.

718
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,830
"And whose brook, a thirst."

719
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:50,232
I am a stranger
In this world.

720
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,501
And there is no one
In the universe.

721
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:55,502
Who understands
the language I speak.

722
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,840
What's great about it?
- I know it's way above you.

723
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,878
Is Mommo Nani at home?

724
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,879
They're both here.
I can't speak now.

725
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,790
What were you
reciting on the phone.

726
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,294
Why were you listening?

727
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:22,295
I too love Urdu verse
specially Faiz Ahmed Faiz.

728
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:28,802
Last night your last memory
filled my heart.

729
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,806
Like the spring's calm
advent in the wilderness.

730
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,211
The next one is even better.

731
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:39,212
Like soft desert footfalls.

732
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:43,483
As rest comes without cause
to a sick man.

733
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,820
Who is the poet?
- Faiz Ahmed Faiz.

734
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,992
Do you remember more?
- A great deal.

735
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,993
"Recite then.
- Speak, for your lips are free."

736
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:58,231
"Speak, your tongue is
still your."

737
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,169
Your upright body is yours.

738
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,170
"Speak, your life is
still yours."

739
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:07,276
I'm slogging to death
in the kitchen.

740
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:10,277
And here poetry
is being recited.

741
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,781
Where are you going?
Don't want to eat ?

742
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:15,782
Tell her I'll eat when I want to.
- Eat quietly. Go on.

743
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:42,208
You are not to read at the table.
How often have I told you?

744
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,979
Tell her.
I'll do as I please.

745
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,984
That's enough!

746
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,985
Any more nonsense and
you'll get a slap from me.

747
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,222
Why does she insist
that I read?

748
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,223
When I want to read
I am told not to.

749
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:13,006
You've scored over me even
in Geography - my subject.

750
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,511
Did you make up
to the teachers?

751
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,512
You never studied and yet
you've got good marks.

752
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,351
Show your card.
- Pass marks only.

753
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,020
Makes no difference.
My dad will give me the camera.

754
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,522
He promised.

755
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:30,523
My dad will give me a book
his idea of fun.

756
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,863
Well done. You have lived
up to all my expectations.

757
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,533
I am very proud of you.
Where would you like to go ?

758
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:44,537
"London, Paris, Rome, Tokyo."

759
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,874
"Rizoo, a letter for you."

760
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:52,278
It's on the table.

761
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,548
Read it later.
First tell me your results.

762
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,388
They're okay.
- That's good.

763
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:09,229
"Dear Riyaz, received your letter.
Reading it I was puzzled."

764
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,832
Your Nani detests me.
How did she let you write to me.

765
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,836
I have learnt to forget that
I have a son called Riyaz.

766
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:21,007
After so many years I do
not want to establish ties.

767
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,512
"l enclose a Demand
Draft for Rs. 1 ,000."

768
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,248
This is why you must have
contacted me after so long.

769
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:29,249
After this don't think
I will give you anything.

770
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,853
Nor should you take
the trouble to write.

771
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,854
Your Mehboob Alam.
- What's this?

772
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,531
Got your results?

773
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,535
Why are you crying?

774
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,540
"May God keep you,
bless you."

775
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,544
See here?
- Thank you Nani.

776
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,085
Children ... This is a Prayer
bestowed in Mecca.

777
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,500
"In the name of God, the
Beneficent, the Mercif."

778
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,501
You alone we worship.

779
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:29,845
You alone we ask for help.

780
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,846
How was the film?
- Good. I had seen it earlier

781
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,617
What's going on?

782
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,520
Since Mammo Nani has come
something's going on.

783
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,356
Can't you see that children
are learning the Quran?

784
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:44,357
"You join as well, son.
- No, I have lots to do."

785
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:47,362
Like watching movies
or loafing with friends.

786
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,363
That's how you'll waste
your holidays.

787
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,875
Come and sit.
- After the holidays.

788
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:05,211
Have some shame.
These kids fast 30 days.

789
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,315
"You don't pray, read the
Quran, nothing."

790
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:10,316
"Sit down, now."

791
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,498
I've been at him for ages
to study the Quran.

792
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,836
See how Mammo has made
him obey all in one go.

793
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,451
What's your name?
- Farzana

794
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,188
Will you explain ...

795
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:49,189
I begin in the name of God
Who is all Merciful.

796
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:55,528
Excellent!

797
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,816
The lesson ends here.
Now you may all go home.

798
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,221
God be with you.

799
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,230
Looks as if Shantabai
is not coming yet again.

800
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,003
She takes off at least
two/three days every week.

801
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,239
She knows Ramzan is on.

802
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,240
Let me help.
- Let it be.

803
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,843
Or you'll say that I was
worse than your sister-in-laws.

804
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:47,013
Don't say that even as a joke.

805
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,852
Slaving away is my destiny.

806
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,853
Some become heroes
others are slaves.

807
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:57,259
What use are
your complaints?

808
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,527
Shall I call Shantabai?
Where does she lives?

809
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:02,528
"In the hutmets behind us.
- Rizoo, come"

810
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,970
Look at the stones.

811
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,214
What a fine car you have!

812
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,829
What a stink!

813
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,832
Seems that the biggest loo
in the world is here.

814
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,003
Where ever is her place?

815
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,250
Have you forgotten
where it is?

816
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:58,251
How long will you lead me.
- It's there.

817
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,793
It's this one?

818
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,800
Look at you?

819
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,972
That man must have
beaten you again.

820
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,973
"Why didn't you tell us
- I'll come to work, promise."

821
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,476
Tell madam to cut two
days pay.

822
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,313
What can I do.

823
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,482
Tell me where that
scoundrel is.

824
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,483
I don't know.
- Don't lie to me.

825
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,822
Tell me where to find him.

826
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,823
He must be somewhere.
You go. I'll come tomorrow.

827
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,493
I will speak to your man
in no uncertain terms.

828
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,830
Take me to him.
- What are you doing?

829
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,900
You don't know the kind
of people they are here.

830
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,836
Let it be- he'll beat
me even more.

831
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,837
I'll see how he beats you.

832
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,012
He's sitting there.
- That guy?

833
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:08,788
You are Shantabai's husband?
- I am.

834
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,192
Scoundrel!
Call yourself a man?

835
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:18,464
Drink away a woman's pay?
Beat her, on top of that.

836
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,202
Old woman, what's this racket?
Is he a relative?"

837
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,973
He's my son.
I've come to take him. Come.

838
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,977
Why should l?
- Get up or else.

839
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,483
Have you gone crazy?

840
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:38,484
Have you no shame?
Serving poison to everyone.

841
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,487
How will you face
your Maker?

842
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,225
Why did you beat me?

843
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,495
Look at her? What you
have reduced her to?

844
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,500
How dare you beat her?
- Ask for her forgiveness.

845
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,005
Swear you won't
strike her again.

846
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:00,006
I swear. Please
forgive me.

847
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:03,776
If you raise your hand
on her again I'll finish you off.

848
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,115
Come along.

849
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:10,116
Not a word to Fejji.
Just say that ...

850
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,954
Shantabai will come to
work from tomorrow.

851
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,457
Are you scared of Nani?

852
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,458
Not at all. She gets upset
at every little thing.

853
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:24,197
All she knows is to worry

854
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:27,467
Don't we all need to worry
about children.

855
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:30,205
She wants the best for you.

856
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:33,206
Then why won't she let me
be a writer?

857
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,577
What do you want
to write about?

858
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,313
Stories.
- What kind?

859
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:41,314
About what I see around me.
- The way that Manto writes.

860
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:47,222
He did the same?

861
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:50,223
He wrote about what
he observed.

862
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,494
That's what I want to do.

863
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,230
I want to experience a
great deal in life ...

864
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,499
.... and write about them.

865
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,500
There are many things
in life ...

866
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,439
.... that it is better not
to experience.

867
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,440
Like what?
- Like experiencing hell.

868
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,445
You've seen hell?

869
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,446
With these very eyes.

870
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:18,184
May God help me to
never witness it again.

871
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,787
Ahmedsaheb (God bless
his soul) and I ...

872
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,194
.... left everything in the
dead of night ...

873
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:29,195
.... carrying only what we had
in our pockets and hands ...

874
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:32,298
.... and journeyed
towards Pakistan.

875
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:36,471
"Along with other refugees,
we were taken in trucks ..."

876
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:39,472
".... to the border...
from there, we walked."

877
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,479
What bad times they were.

878
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,480
Suffering. Fire.
Blood. Looting.

879
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,487
Screams of the dying.

880
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:59,992
There were around 500 of us.

881
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:02,830
While we were crossing
over from this side ...

882
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:05,831
.... just as many were coming
across from the other

883
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,003
"From this side,
the people were Muslims."

884
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:12,004
"From that side,
Hindus and Sikhs."

885
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:15,243
But both sides went
through the same trauma.

886
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:18,244
"Abandoning their homes,
property, loved ones."

887
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:24,517
There was a woman
walking along with me.

888
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:29,522
She had two small children.

889
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:32,525
One died while in her arms.

890
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:38,864
Where was the time
for any burial.

891
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,035
When we came to a river
people told her to ...

892
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:46,038
.... dispose of the dead body
in its waters.

893
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,542
The poor woman
was not in her senses.

894
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,881
She threw the live baby
into the river.

895
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,552
And held the dead child
strapped to her breast.

896
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,823
"Her worn and weary eyes
are still before me,..."

897
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,827
.... and her shriek ...

898
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,000
.... all this ...

899
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:15,001
.... you saw with your
own eyes?

900
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,505
And much more.

901
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,506
I will write about
all of this.

902
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,844
Who will read it?
no one wants to cry over sorrow.

903
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:28,249
This is what Life is.

904
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,250
Life is ahead of you.

905
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,022
There is much more to life
either than sorrow.

906
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:36,257
What did Ghalib write ...

907
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:38,359
When man is so
filled with sorrow.

908
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,528
Then sorrows ease away.

909
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:43,529
I was so burdened with misery.
That Life became easy to bear.

910
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,268
Whatever you write ...

911
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:49,537
.... let it be from
from the heart.

912
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,538
This new film is
about the Partition.

913
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,976
Shall I get three
tickets for tomorrow?

914
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,977
Will Fejji come?
- It's a serious film.

915
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:02,281
About Life?

916
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:34,013
"Mother, here is
our old house."

917
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:53,532
If at this time you
talk of leaving India...

918
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,537
don't interrupt
when adults are talking.

919
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,538
I just wanted to know what
will happen to my education.

920
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,975
It looks as if they've
filmed my life.

921
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,812
Remember our neighbor
Khan Saheb house in Panipat?

922
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,815
His house was just like
this one.

923
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,489
Don't disturb others.

924
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:17,490
May people never be
so forsaken again.

925
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:43,119
These memories refuse
to leave me.

926
01:13:44,523 --> 01:13:46,791
While he and l
were together ...

927
01:13:46,792 --> 01:13:49,792
.... we shared such good times.

928
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:54,130
But the day he died ...

929
01:13:57,303 --> 01:14:00,303
.... and looked at me
for the last time ...

930
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,640
.... his eyes seeking pardon
for leaving me alone...

931
01:14:07,146 --> 01:14:10,146
.... his brother refused to
spend a pie on his burial...

932
01:14:12,818 --> 01:14:15,818
"They said, "Barren witch,
you devoured your husband"."

933
01:14:18,324 --> 01:14:21,324
"And are now bent on
devouring us"."

934
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,560
How long could l
take their treatment?

935
01:14:24,563 --> 01:14:27,563
I had to leave.
- Why torture yourself.

936
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:31,567
It had to be so.

937
01:14:33,339 --> 01:14:36,339
"A letter, Nani."

938
01:14:38,177 --> 01:14:41,177
Who is it from ?
- Anwari Aunty.

939
01:14:43,782 --> 01:14:46,782
Did I not say ...
she was cheating us.

940
01:14:49,788 --> 01:14:51,789
I persisted that day
that's why she's sent it.

941
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,790
"Rizoo, put it in Fixed
Deposits tomorrow."

942
01:14:56,128 --> 01:14:58,529
Have you gone mad?

943
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:01,530
"We each should get 50,000.
Send the cheques back ..."

944
01:15:02,534 --> 01:15:04,635
.... saying they can pay for
Sabir's funeral.

945
01:15:04,636 --> 01:15:07,636
Will you fight on
till you die?

946
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,140
"Tell us, does your cheque
go in the bank or not."

947
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:13,311
What will I do with it
in the bank?

948
01:15:13,312 --> 01:15:15,246
I have to buy many
household things.

949
01:15:15,247 --> 01:15:18,247
And there's Ida on soon.
- You have all you need here.

950
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:20,818
We will manage
as we have done.

951
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:23,819
Why do you worry?
Just extend your Visa.

952
01:15:24,156 --> 01:15:27,156
Don't be anxious.
That man there is a good man.

953
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:30,159
What was his name?
- inspector Apte.

954
01:15:31,563 --> 01:15:34,563
"Why do you need an extension?
- I am very ill, sir."

955
01:15:37,169 --> 01:15:39,771
You don't look ill.

956
01:15:39,772 --> 01:15:42,772
What can I say?
I have trouble breathing.

957
01:15:43,509 --> 01:15:46,509
I feel suffocated.
My heart too is not okay.

958
01:15:47,112 --> 01:15:49,280
Tell him.

959
01:15:49,281 --> 01:15:52,281
The doctor has said
that she mustn't travel.

960
01:15:54,787 --> 01:15:57,121
I hear this all the time.

961
01:15:57,122 --> 01:16:00,122
Can't find a new excuse?

962
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:01,893
How long will it take
for you to get well?

963
01:16:01,894 --> 01:16:03,795
Extend the Visa
by three months.

964
01:16:03,796 --> 01:16:06,130
I can't give
you more than 25 days.

965
01:16:06,131 --> 01:16:08,132
It is all in your hands.

966
01:16:08,133 --> 01:16:11,133
May your children prosper.
How are your three girls ?

967
01:16:13,138 --> 01:16:16,138
How do you know about them?
- You've forgotten so soon?

968
01:16:16,141 --> 01:16:19,141
You told me the last time.

969
01:16:20,312 --> 01:16:23,312
25 days and not
one day more.

970
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:26,549
And get the Doctor's Certificate.
- Of course.

971
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:29,819
"May God give you a long
life. The box, son?"

972
01:16:31,156 --> 01:16:32,757
Please take this.
- What's it?

973
01:16:32,758 --> 01:16:35,758
"Sweetmeats, for the children.
I made them, with my hands."

974
01:16:36,662 --> 01:16:37,929
.... in pure ghee.

975
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,930
Ask the peon
to distribute them.

976
01:16:48,607 --> 01:16:51,108
Take this.

977
01:16:51,109 --> 01:16:54,109
You look so healthy.
Who'll give the Certificate?

978
01:16:54,112 --> 01:16:57,112
God will have mercy
and provide someone.

979
01:16:58,784 --> 01:17:01,519
Do you need something?
- No.

980
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,520
"If you do, tell me. Passport,
visa, dollars, sterling, dirhams..."

981
01:17:07,226 --> 01:17:09,527
My name is Raju Agent.
- We don't need anything.

982
01:17:09,528 --> 01:17:12,528
I'll get you a medical.
certificate

983
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:15,233
We don't need anything.

984
01:17:15,234 --> 01:17:16,901
You can get me
a certificate?

985
01:17:16,902 --> 01:17:19,303
"Want it today, 1 ,000.
Tomorrow, 500."

986
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:21,405
Next week?
- 300

987
01:17:21,406 --> 01:17:24,406
Are you mad ? Who will give
so much for a slip of paper.

988
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:25,910
I'll give a hundred.

989
01:17:25,911 --> 01:17:28,911
"250, okay. Special rate
for you."

990
01:17:29,147 --> 01:17:31,549
Hundred and no more.

991
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:34,550
Bargaining as you would
over vegetables!

992
01:17:36,655 --> 01:17:39,655
"No. No more than 200
- Okay, settled at 200"

993
01:17:40,092 --> 01:17:43,092
What disease do you
want ... what to write.

994
01:17:43,095 --> 01:17:46,095
Old age. The disease of diseases.
- There's no such disease.

995
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,601
I get breathless
climbing steps.

996
01:17:50,602 --> 01:17:53,602
That will do.
Shall I write asthma?

997
01:17:56,108 --> 01:17:59,108
Breathe like that
in front of the doctor.

998
01:18:06,518 --> 01:18:09,518
God is Great
He is Everybody's God.

999
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,300
You ! Cover your head or
the devil will beat you.

1000
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:36,545
I'll be back.

1001
01:18:41,186 --> 01:18:43,754
Riyaz is out.
- Where's he ?

1002
01:18:43,755 --> 01:18:46,755
I don't know.
Come up for minute.

1003
01:18:50,262 --> 01:18:53,262
Recite loudly now.

1004
01:19:02,107 --> 01:19:05,107
Tomorrow is Riyaz's
fifteenth birthday.

1005
01:19:06,511 --> 01:19:08,613
I know.
- I thought...

1006
01:19:08,614 --> 01:19:11,614
....we should give him a party
but he shouldn't know of it.

1007
01:19:12,217 --> 01:19:13,718
Surprise party?
- Like the idea ?

1008
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:16,621
It'll be fun.
- You tell his friends...

1009
01:19:16,622 --> 01:19:18,289
.... to be here after iftar
(breaking of fast).

1010
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:20,791
But Rizoo should not know.

1011
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:23,792
Will you do that?

1012
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:39,541
I'm off.
- Wait.

1013
01:19:40,746 --> 01:19:43,746
May God bless you.

1014
01:19:53,091 --> 01:19:55,259
"Shantabai, come."

1015
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:57,762
How is your husband?

1016
01:19:57,763 --> 01:20:00,763
He returns early now.
Drinks less too.

1017
01:20:01,099 --> 01:20:04,099
This is for you.

1018
01:20:07,506 --> 01:20:10,506
"It's the boy's
birthday, you see."

1019
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:14,510
On the road give
alms to the poor.

1020
01:20:16,114 --> 01:20:19,114
May God guide you.
Take this.

1021
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,520
Why should I say ?
See for yourself.

1022
01:20:29,127 --> 01:20:32,127
Tape recorder!

1023
01:20:38,236 --> 01:20:40,571
"You've become rich,
birthday boy ?"

1024
01:20:40,572 --> 01:20:42,840
My Granny gives money
every birthday ...

1025
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:45,841
to distribute to beggars.

1026
01:20:46,078 --> 01:20:49,078
"Eat something?
- No, I'm fasting."

1027
01:20:49,247 --> 01:20:52,247
"You, fasting."

1028
01:20:52,751 --> 01:20:54,185
Since when have you
become a Muslim?

1029
01:20:54,186 --> 01:20:56,087
Mammo Nani is
very particular.

1030
01:20:56,088 --> 01:20:59,088
I promised her that
every birthday I will fast.

1031
01:20:59,491 --> 01:21:02,491
"You're a big bore.
Here, take this."

1032
01:21:03,762 --> 01:21:06,762
I reserved it ahead.

1033
01:21:12,771 --> 01:21:15,506
It's superb.

1034
01:21:15,507 --> 01:21:17,775
How is your story
coming along?

1035
01:21:17,776 --> 01:21:20,776
About Mammo Nani?
I'm revising it.

1036
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:22,780
How does it go.

1037
01:21:22,781 --> 01:21:25,781
"Simple story. Mammo Nani
leaves her home, family ..."

1038
01:21:26,785 --> 01:21:29,785
.... and goes away with her
husband Ahmedbhai ...

1039
01:21:30,222 --> 01:21:33,222
.... to an unknown land.
She has no one there.

1040
01:21:33,792 --> 01:21:36,792
"Ahmedbhai tells her,
"You are my Queen"

1041
01:21:36,795 --> 01:21:39,795
He gave her gold and
wealth and said...

1042
01:21:40,232 --> 01:21:43,232
"Do not fear. We will face
life's hurdles together"."

1043
01:21:44,736 --> 01:21:47,736
"One day, Death claims him."

1044
01:21:49,074 --> 01:21:51,742
Mammo Nani has no one
to befriend her.

1045
01:21:51,743 --> 01:21:54,743
So she flees to her sister.
And starts life anew.

1046
01:21:56,081 --> 01:21:59,081
What's the point?

1047
01:22:00,752 --> 01:22:03,752
Everyone returns
to their roots.

1048
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,490
Ridiculous.

1049
01:22:19,104 --> 01:22:22,104
Granny.
What need for all this?

1050
01:22:23,108 --> 01:22:25,509
What else happens
on a birthday?

1051
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:27,611
Who will eat
such a big cake?

1052
01:22:27,612 --> 01:22:30,612
God will send people.

1053
01:22:31,783 --> 01:22:34,783
I'll open it.

1054
01:22:43,061 --> 01:22:46,061
Who called you?

1055
01:22:54,472 --> 01:22:57,472
"Boys, give him the
birthday bumps."

1056
01:23:16,261 --> 01:23:18,195
Stop ! This birthday
can't happen.

1057
01:23:18,196 --> 01:23:19,296
Why not?

1058
01:23:19,297 --> 01:23:21,765
Because I must first
recite a poem.

1059
01:23:21,766 --> 01:23:24,766
I have a friend
His name is Riyaz.

1060
01:23:26,771 --> 01:23:29,771
"Who looked like an
over-grown "piyaz" (onion)."

1061
01:23:30,508 --> 01:23:33,508
"When he went to school
He stank of onion, the fool."

1062
01:23:34,613 --> 01:23:37,613
He fled his class one day
Running home all the way!

1063
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:46,121
Time to eat
Don't be shy.

1064
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:59,801
Granny made these.

1065
01:24:06,544 --> 01:24:09,544
"Shantabai, sherbet
for the children..."

1066
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:17,319
.... there's sweet chutney too.

1067
01:24:18,657 --> 01:24:21,657
Have more?

1068
01:24:24,562 --> 01:24:27,562
Didn't like it?

1069
01:24:33,838 --> 01:24:36,838
"More sherbet, Shantabai."

1070
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:49,117
"Granny, who called
all of them?"

1071
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:52,222
Your Mammo Nani.
She did it all. Ask her.

1072
01:24:52,223 --> 01:24:55,223
She wanted to surprise you.

1073
01:24:55,527 --> 01:24:58,527
I never wanted them
to come to my place.

1074
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,898
Don't speak that way.

1075
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:03,899
They're here now.
Come and talk to them.

1076
01:25:04,536 --> 01:25:07,536
I won't go.
- What will they think?

1077
01:25:08,807 --> 01:25:11,807
And Mammo Nani?
- I won't go.

1078
01:25:32,831 --> 01:25:35,831
What is Rizoo doing inside?

1079
01:25:36,334 --> 01:25:39,334
He must be tired.
- It's late. We must go.

1080
01:25:50,515 --> 01:25:53,515
See how many gifts
there are for you.

1081
01:25:55,286 --> 01:25:57,788
Open them.

1082
01:25:57,789 --> 01:26:00,524
I don't want to see them.

1083
01:26:00,525 --> 01:26:03,525
Given with such love
and you won't open them?

1084
01:26:03,795 --> 01:26:05,896
What need was there
to do all this?

1085
01:26:05,897 --> 01:26:08,532
I've never called anyone
here except Rohan.

1086
01:26:08,533 --> 01:26:10,634
Today you called
all of them.

1087
01:26:10,635 --> 01:26:12,803
You insulted me
before by friends.

1088
01:26:12,804 --> 01:26:15,804
What's wrong in having
called them?

1089
01:26:15,807 --> 01:26:17,541
Why are you feeling
bad about it?

1090
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:20,144
Because we are not
like them.

1091
01:26:20,145 --> 01:26:22,546
So what ?
We are what we are...

1092
01:26:22,547 --> 01:26:24,314
They are what they are...

1093
01:26:24,315 --> 01:26:26,550
Do you know what they are?
- What ?

1094
01:26:26,551 --> 01:26:29,551
"They have big houses.
Servants, furniture, books."

1095
01:26:29,821 --> 01:26:32,656
They are all so rich.
- They may be rich at home.

1096
01:26:32,657 --> 01:26:34,425
They had fun over here.

1097
01:26:34,426 --> 01:26:36,827
And where have they had such
food in their lives?

1098
01:26:36,828 --> 01:26:39,828
"Not in seven lives, I'm sure
they must be running me down."

1099
01:26:40,498 --> 01:26:43,267
Let them ?
Who cares for such hypocrites.

1100
01:26:43,268 --> 01:26:45,502
Why do you interfere?

1101
01:26:45,503 --> 01:26:48,172
Granny lets you live here
does not mean ...

1102
01:26:48,173 --> 01:26:51,173
".... you can do as you please.
Big deal, celebrating my birthday."

1103
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:55,279
You don't like
my staying here?

1104
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,115
That is so.
I have no privacy now.

1105
01:26:58,116 --> 01:27:00,217
"what I drink, eat read ..."

1106
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:02,786
You won't leave me be
for even a minute.

1107
01:27:02,787 --> 01:27:05,787
"He is right, Mammo."

1108
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:08,790
That's your habit.
Wherever you go you take charge.

1109
01:27:09,794 --> 01:27:12,529
Since you've come
you're after Rizoo.

1110
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,530
You've been bossing me
since childhood.

1111
01:27:15,533 --> 01:27:17,301
It's not like that ...

1112
01:27:17,302 --> 01:27:19,536
.... I take this house
to be my own.

1113
01:27:19,537 --> 01:27:22,139
Is that wrong?
- This is not your house.

1114
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:25,140
You are a guest here.

1115
01:27:26,144 --> 01:27:29,144
A guest?

1116
01:27:29,314 --> 01:27:32,314
A guest in my own
sister's house?

1117
01:27:33,318 --> 01:27:36,318
Fejji?

1118
01:27:38,756 --> 01:27:41,756
Those who don't have
their own home...

1119
01:27:44,496 --> 01:27:47,496
.... have no home at all.

1120
01:27:48,766 --> 01:27:51,766
I will go now.
God bless.

1121
01:27:51,769 --> 01:27:54,505
She's really gone.

1122
01:27:54,506 --> 01:27:57,506
Bring her back.
- I won't go.

1123
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:01,211
Where will she go ?
She doesn't know her way.

1124
01:28:01,212 --> 01:28:03,213
Look for her
on the terrace.

1125
01:28:03,214 --> 01:28:06,214
I will not go.
- Then I will.

1126
01:28:17,295 --> 01:28:20,295
I never could cross ...

1127
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,800
.... the distances
of your streets...

1128
01:28:27,138 --> 01:28:30,138
A thousand times ...
I hesitated.

1129
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:35,310
Only to re-start again.

1130
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:09,110
Who knows the earth ...

1131
01:29:11,115 --> 01:29:14,115
.... of one's land?

1132
01:29:25,797 --> 01:29:28,532
I walked with dirt
in my eyes.

1133
01:29:28,533 --> 01:29:31,533
And a cloud of dust
over my heart.

1134
01:30:14,612 --> 01:30:17,612
What boundaries are these
that entangle my feet.

1135
01:30:33,798 --> 01:30:36,798
Again and again
I tried to reach my home in vain.

1136
01:32:51,068 --> 01:32:54,068
"See, Rizoo has come
to fetch his Mammo Nani."

1137
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:59,240
You go. And tell everyone
Mammo is dead.

1138
01:33:03,748 --> 01:33:06,748
You will see my corpse
if you don't come home.

1139
01:33:07,752 --> 01:33:10,752
Please come home.

1140
01:34:34,338 --> 01:34:37,338
How content these small
fish are.

1141
01:34:37,341 --> 01:34:40,341
no one can take them away
from their little home.

1142
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:50,118
Why are you sitting here?

1143
01:34:50,788 --> 01:34:53,788
Do you permit this poor old
woman to sit in the balcony.

1144
01:34:55,526 --> 01:34:58,526
I treated you very badly
yesterday.

1145
01:35:00,131 --> 01:35:03,131
I was thinking only of myself

1146
01:35:03,134 --> 01:35:05,535
That's the difference.

1147
01:35:05,536 --> 01:35:08,536
Young people think
only of themselves.

1148
01:35:08,539 --> 01:35:10,807
"Old people, of others."

1149
01:35:10,808 --> 01:35:13,808
Are you afraid of old age?

1150
01:35:14,545 --> 01:35:17,545
Not old age.

1151
01:35:18,549 --> 01:35:21,549
I'm very afraid of loneliness.

1152
01:35:23,154 --> 01:35:26,154
Faiz put it so well.

1153
01:35:27,158 --> 01:35:29,559
Put out the candles...

1154
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,560
".... remove wine,
flask and cup."

1155
01:35:33,564 --> 01:35:36,564
Lock up your
sleepless portals.

1156
01:35:38,169 --> 01:35:40,503
"Now, no one will come here."

1157
01:35:40,504 --> 01:35:43,504
No one any more.

1158
01:35:45,776 --> 01:35:48,776
Leave all this.
Let's talk of something useful.

1159
01:35:49,513 --> 01:35:52,513
Shall we see a film?
- Of course.

1160
01:35:54,518 --> 01:35:57,518
We'll take Fejji too.

1161
01:36:06,797 --> 01:36:09,797
What is this man doing ?
I can't understand any of it.

1162
01:36:11,135 --> 01:36:12,802
Quiet.

1163
01:36:12,803 --> 01:36:15,803
I'll tell you when we get home.
- All of it ?

1164
01:36:16,307 --> 01:36:19,307
Okay.

1165
01:36:30,554 --> 01:36:32,822
Tell me now.

1166
01:36:32,823 --> 01:36:35,823
Who was that man?
Kept murdering everyone.

1167
01:36:36,327 --> 01:36:38,495
Such a bad film.
I went to sleep.

1168
01:36:38,496 --> 01:36:41,496
Murder after murder.
- It's a detective story.

1169
01:36:42,099 --> 01:36:43,767
What?

1170
01:36:43,768 --> 01:36:46,768
With no crime what work
will the detective have?

1171
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:51,105
That's the fun of it.

1172
01:36:51,275 --> 01:36:54,275
Who was the man whose wife
kept cooking and cooking?

1173
01:36:55,279 --> 01:36:57,514
He's the detective
a police officer.

1174
01:36:57,515 --> 01:37:00,515
I see.

1175
01:37:00,785 --> 01:37:03,785
Reminds me. I should meet
Apte Sahib for my Visa.

1176
01:37:05,122 --> 01:37:08,122
He won't do anything.
He's said so.

1177
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:11,125
I'll cry before him.
- He's seen all that.

1178
01:37:11,529 --> 01:37:14,529
Shall we catch that agent
who got us the Certificate?

1179
01:37:15,533 --> 01:37:16,900
Who?

1180
01:37:16,901 --> 01:37:19,901
That man with goggles. Raju.
- That dark fellow.

1181
01:37:22,139 --> 01:37:24,641
He gave us his card.

1182
01:37:24,642 --> 01:37:27,642
You have it?
- Should be here.

1183
01:37:29,146 --> 01:37:31,548
Is this it?
Read the address.

1184
01:37:31,549 --> 01:37:32,916
It's in Dharavi.

1185
01:37:32,917 --> 01:37:35,218
Don't you dare take
Mammo Nani there.

1186
01:37:35,219 --> 01:37:38,219
That area is not for women.
- Should I go alone then?

1187
01:37:38,756 --> 01:37:41,756
Go with Rohan.
- Okay.

1188
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:17,291
Do you know Raju Agent?

1189
01:38:17,795 --> 01:38:19,529
He lives across over there.

1190
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:22,530
The man standing there?

1191
01:38:26,637 --> 01:38:29,637
Excuse me.

1192
01:38:30,541 --> 01:38:33,541
We need Mammo Nani's
Health Certificate.

1193
01:38:33,544 --> 01:38:34,644
Which one?

1194
01:38:34,645 --> 01:38:37,645
Mehmooda Begum Ahmed Ali.
don't you remember.

1195
01:38:37,815 --> 01:38:40,815
That stout woman
who jabbers away.

1196
01:38:43,754 --> 01:38:46,754
You need another?
Not possible.

1197
01:38:48,092 --> 01:38:51,092
The Police acts tough if
you get a second Certificate.

1198
01:38:52,263 --> 01:38:55,263
I don't want trouble.
Try elsewhere.

1199
01:38:56,267 --> 01:38:59,267
What should we do.

1200
01:38:59,770 --> 01:39:02,770
I will tell you of a cheap
and permanent way out.

1201
01:39:30,801 --> 01:39:32,535
Who do you want?

1202
01:39:32,536 --> 01:39:35,536
"Raju Agent, short
and very dark."

1203
01:39:35,806 --> 01:39:37,640
No one like that here.

1204
01:39:37,641 --> 01:39:40,476
He said to come here.
Trishna Hotel.

1205
01:39:40,477 --> 01:39:43,477
- Not Trishna Nani, Krishna Hotel.
- Krishna is across."

1206
01:39:44,748 --> 01:39:47,748
Let's get out fast.

1207
01:40:10,107 --> 01:40:11,875
Why so late?

1208
01:40:11,876 --> 01:40:14,611
He's been waiting for ages.
Now he's off mood.

1209
01:40:14,612 --> 01:40:17,612
"Hello, inspector Apte."

1210
01:40:18,282 --> 01:40:21,282
Don't take his name.
Heed after much persuasion.

1211
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:26,120
Thank you for coming here
to help an old woman.

1212
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:29,790
Two teas.

1213
01:40:31,128 --> 01:40:34,128
How much longer will you stay?
- The days that remain.

1214
01:40:36,133 --> 01:40:38,468
This is my home-land.

1215
01:40:38,469 --> 01:40:41,070
I was born in Panipat.

1216
01:40:41,071 --> 01:40:43,740
I am here with
my loved ones.

1217
01:40:43,741 --> 01:40:45,575
Have I no right
to live here?

1218
01:40:45,576 --> 01:40:48,576
"Why tell me. Saheb knows
your problem, right?"

1219
01:40:49,079 --> 01:40:52,079
Can't her case be closed?

1220
01:40:52,483 --> 01:40:55,483
She has no one except
my Granny and myself.

1221
01:40:57,087 --> 01:40:59,255
It's not that simple.

1222
01:40:59,256 --> 01:41:01,491
This is not about two people
but two nations.

1223
01:41:01,492 --> 01:41:04,492
Case can't be closed.
But her papers can vanish.

1224
01:41:07,765 --> 01:41:10,099
Have you the goods?
- Goods?

1225
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:13,100
Money. Cash.

1226
01:41:15,105 --> 01:41:18,105
"I have brought all
that my sister has, 5000."

1227
01:41:20,778 --> 01:41:23,778
"Don't mention the sum.
- Forgive me. Here's 4,800."

1228
01:41:32,523 --> 01:41:35,523
I've run around; brought
Sir here. Something for me?

1229
01:41:51,475 --> 01:41:54,475
Now leave straightaway.
Don't turn to look at Sir.

1230
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:59,580
Go straight.

1231
01:42:23,507 --> 01:42:26,507
You're all wet.
remove your shoes.

1232
01:42:26,777 --> 01:42:29,777
"Go bathe, son.
I'll bring fresh clothes."

1233
01:42:31,515 --> 01:42:34,515
"These Bombay rains are
something. On now, off again."

1234
01:42:35,786 --> 01:42:38,786
What happened out there ?
- God willing all will be fine.

1235
01:42:40,057 --> 01:42:42,725
"My clothes, quickly."

1236
01:42:42,726 --> 01:42:45,726
Wretch!
Where did you get this?

1237
01:42:47,064 --> 01:42:50,064
Shameless fellow!
Call this reading?

1238
01:42:50,734 --> 01:42:53,236
This is why I struggled
to send you to school?

1239
01:42:53,237 --> 01:42:56,072
Ingrate!
- Why beat him? He's no child.

1240
01:42:56,073 --> 01:42:59,073
Don't dare interfere!
You're the root cause.

1241
01:42:59,243 --> 01:43:01,744
"You encourage him."
"Let him read".

1242
01:43:01,745 --> 01:43:04,745
See the results.
- I didn't ask him to read this.

1243
01:43:05,082 --> 01:43:07,583
"Even so, it's a sign
that he's grown up."

1244
01:43:07,584 --> 01:43:10,086
It's time for him
to see women and the like.

1245
01:43:10,087 --> 01:43:12,255
Get him engaged.
- I won't hear your nonsense.

1246
01:43:12,256 --> 01:43:15,256
I know what to do.

1247
01:43:27,104 --> 01:43:29,505
Mother asked if you will
come for iftar dinner.

1248
01:43:29,506 --> 01:43:32,506
Of course I will.

1249
01:43:37,781 --> 01:43:40,781
Mrs. Rizvi wants us to
dine with her.

1250
01:43:41,785 --> 01:43:44,785
Till today she's not been
so kind. Why now?

1251
01:43:46,523 --> 01:43:49,523
Because I teach her
daughter Farzana.

1252
01:43:49,526 --> 01:43:50,893
Was I born yesterday?

1253
01:43:50,894 --> 01:43:53,396
Don't I know that you
are plotting to ...

1254
01:43:53,397 --> 01:43:56,397
match Farzana and Rizoo?
- What is this?

1255
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,800
I can see through you.

1256
01:44:01,638 --> 01:44:04,638
Since you've come here
our lives are hell.

1257
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:07,641
You've occupied this flat.
You're trying to ensnare my grandson.

1258
01:44:12,549 --> 01:44:14,650
"Granny, stop it."

1259
01:44:14,651 --> 01:44:17,651
Shut up! Wretch!
Come here

1260
01:44:20,824 --> 01:44:23,824
I feed and clothe you
and you turn against me.

1261
01:44:27,331 --> 01:44:30,331
In Pakistan they rightly
called you a witch.

1262
01:44:30,834 --> 01:44:33,834
You devoured my Zubeida and now.
- Stop. You've said enough.

1263
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,840
See how the Maharani sits
as if she's not heard a word.

1264
01:44:42,112 --> 01:44:45,112
"Granny, don't shout.
Why talk of such useless things."

1265
01:44:45,516 --> 01:44:48,117
Be quiet.

1266
01:44:48,118 --> 01:44:51,118
This is not my magazine.
Farrokh asked me to keep it.

1267
01:44:52,289 --> 01:44:55,289
Some excuse that is.

1268
01:45:00,297 --> 01:45:03,297
Say prayers and
your anger will cool.

1269
01:45:04,134 --> 01:45:07,134
I got carried away saying all
manner of things.

1270
01:45:09,806 --> 01:45:12,806
To blow up issues is
an old habit of yours.

1271
01:45:13,143 --> 01:45:15,311
Your anger is like
the Bombay rains.

1272
01:45:15,312 --> 01:45:18,147
On one minute.
Off the next.

1273
01:45:18,148 --> 01:45:21,148
Forgotten how you broke
my doll?

1274
01:45:22,152 --> 01:45:25,152
Because it had a blue frock
while yours was white.

1275
01:45:25,822 --> 01:45:28,822
You were no less. You never
let me touch your doll.

1276
01:45:29,159 --> 01:45:32,159
That green perfume bottle
from Lucknow ?

1277
01:45:32,162 --> 01:45:35,162
Who threw it in the gutter.

1278
01:45:35,832 --> 01:45:37,767
You two are the limit.

1279
01:45:37,768 --> 01:45:40,768
Fight like children
and then make up.

1280
01:45:40,771 --> 01:45:43,105
That's how siblings behave.

1281
01:45:43,106 --> 01:45:45,775
How will be know ?
He's an only child.

1282
01:45:45,776 --> 01:45:48,611
Mammo. You didn't take
my words to heart?

1283
01:45:48,612 --> 01:45:50,780
Not at all.

1284
01:45:50,781 --> 01:45:53,781
The words just poured out.
- Why should I feel bad?

1285
01:46:11,535 --> 01:46:14,535
Can I come in?
I won't disturb you?

1286
01:46:16,807 --> 01:46:19,807
Come in.

1287
01:46:20,143 --> 01:46:23,143
Let it play.
I don't like silence.

1288
01:46:24,147 --> 01:46:27,147
"What record is it?
- "Four Seasons"."

1289
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:30,150
I like it.

1290
01:46:31,154 --> 01:46:32,922
I brought this
to show you.

1291
01:46:32,923 --> 01:46:35,324
I will give this to Fejji for Ida.
- What is it?

1292
01:46:35,325 --> 01:46:38,325
Her hands are worn out
with grinding spices.

1293
01:46:38,495 --> 01:46:40,596
With this it's easy.

1294
01:46:40,597 --> 01:46:43,597
Plug on ...
Spice mix ready!

1295
01:46:45,269 --> 01:46:48,269
Like it?
- Yes.

1296
01:46:49,273 --> 01:46:51,774
You forgot me?

1297
01:46:51,775 --> 01:46:54,110
How can I?

1298
01:46:54,111 --> 01:46:57,111
I thought I'd have a
sherwani tailored for you.

1299
01:46:58,515 --> 01:47:01,515
Keep extra folds or in
six months it won't fit.

1300
01:47:04,521 --> 01:47:07,521
You had to choose black?

1301
01:47:07,524 --> 01:47:09,525
He'll look a crow in this.

1302
01:47:09,526 --> 01:47:12,526
Black is okay.
It won't show dirt.

1303
01:47:14,298 --> 01:47:17,298
"Master, with it a kurta
and Aligarhi pyajamas."

1304
01:47:19,303 --> 01:47:22,303
And a topi.
- No topi.

1305
01:47:22,806 --> 01:47:24,140
Are you mad?

1306
01:47:24,141 --> 01:47:25,641
Return in four days
for the trial.

1307
01:47:25,642 --> 01:47:28,642
It will be Ida then.
I want it tomorrow.

1308
01:47:31,148 --> 01:47:34,148
Pistachios are costly here.

1309
01:47:35,152 --> 01:47:38,152
You are eating the lot.
What'll we put in the sweet.

1310
01:47:39,489 --> 01:47:42,489
- Does Rizoo like it?
- Very much.

1311
01:47:44,594 --> 01:47:47,594
"Shantabai, see who it is?"

1312
01:47:57,107 --> 01:47:59,775
Mehmooda Begum
Ahmed Ali lives here?

1313
01:47:59,776 --> 01:48:02,776
"She lives here, doesn't she.
- Who is it?"

1314
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:06,780
The police.

1315
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:33,140
What is it?
- Are you Mehmooda Begum?

1316
01:48:34,144 --> 01:48:37,144
Yes.

1317
01:48:37,547 --> 01:48:40,547
Deportation Order.
Come with us.

1318
01:48:41,084 --> 01:48:43,753
Tomorrow is Ida.

1319
01:48:43,754 --> 01:48:46,754
Quiet ! Hiding in India when
your Visa has expired?

1320
01:48:48,759 --> 01:48:51,759
It's not like that.
Come and sit inside.

1321
01:48:52,763 --> 01:48:54,697
The boy will return soon
and explain it all.

1322
01:48:54,698 --> 01:48:57,698
Stop this talk ! Will you
come or we'll handcuff you.

1323
01:48:58,502 --> 01:49:01,502
Handcuffs?
- There's no time. Hurry.

1324
01:49:01,772 --> 01:49:04,772
We have two others
to catch.

1325
01:49:39,476 --> 01:49:42,476
Let go my sister.
She's done nothing.

1326
01:50:14,511 --> 01:50:17,511
What happened?

1327
01:50:19,115 --> 01:50:22,115
They took her away.
- Who?

1328
01:50:25,121 --> 01:50:28,121
Two police people.

1329
01:50:33,129 --> 01:50:36,129
Where?

1330
01:50:37,534 --> 01:50:40,534
They didn't even let her
take her clothes.

1331
01:50:41,071 --> 01:50:44,071
I don't know where she is.

1332
01:50:58,488 --> 01:51:01,488
Where's inspector Apte?
- He is transferred.

1333
01:51:02,092 --> 01:51:05,092
But he said Mammo Nani
could stay with us.

1334
01:51:05,762 --> 01:51:07,763
Then why did the police
take her?

1335
01:51:07,764 --> 01:51:10,764
All Pakistanis overstaying
are being sent back.

1336
01:51:11,268 --> 01:51:13,502
Where will Mammo Nani be?

1337
01:51:13,503 --> 01:51:16,503
One lot is being sent today
by the Frontier Mail.

1338
01:51:16,606 --> 01:51:19,606
Go to Bombay Central Station.
You may find her there.

1339
01:51:25,782 --> 01:51:28,782
Where are you taking me?

1340
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:32,119
I couldn't even wish him.

1341
01:51:32,289 --> 01:51:35,289
I just have the clothes on my back.
All my things are left behind.

1342
01:51:35,792 --> 01:51:38,792
Even my Prayer Mat!
How unjust can you be.

1343
01:51:39,729 --> 01:51:42,231
Think of God.

1344
01:51:42,232 --> 01:51:45,232
Why cry?
You are returning to your home.

1345
01:51:45,468 --> 01:51:46,835
Why grumble?

1346
01:51:46,836 --> 01:51:49,836
My home is here.
I want to be buried here.

1347
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:53,740
Giving me six feet space
would harm no one.

1348
01:51:53,743 --> 01:51:55,177
Come.

1349
01:51:55,178 --> 01:51:58,178
"Aunt, take care
of this child."

1350
01:51:58,582 --> 01:52:01,582
He's just been operated.
He's a little weak.

1351
01:52:02,085 --> 01:52:05,085
"Child, don't be afraid.
She is with you."

1352
01:52:12,762 --> 01:52:15,762
What kind of duty is this
to accompany them.

1353
01:52:15,765 --> 01:52:18,500
I called Amritsar. Few more
will be sent off tomorrow.

1354
01:52:18,501 --> 01:52:20,269
We've done all that.

1355
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:23,270
Why do these people
stay in India?

1356
01:52:23,773 --> 01:52:26,275
What will they get here?

1357
01:52:26,276 --> 01:52:29,276
Has she sat down?
- Yes.

1358
01:53:01,244 --> 01:53:04,244
Where are you going?

1359
01:53:08,251 --> 01:53:11,251
I never could cross...

1360
01:53:12,255 --> 01:53:15,255
.... the distances...

1361
01:53:16,493 --> 01:53:19,493
.... of your streets.

1362
01:53:29,105 --> 01:53:32,105
This true story took
place 20 years ago.

1363
01:53:32,509 --> 01:53:35,509
"To date, we have made every
effort to find Mehmooda Begum."

1364
01:53:36,513 --> 01:53:38,514
But there was no sign of her.

1365
01:53:38,515 --> 01:53:41,515
"Relatives and friends in Lahore,
Islamabad, Karachi and Multan ..."

1366
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:47,220
.... said they had no news of her.

1367
01:53:48,291 --> 01:53:51,291
Who knows if she is alive or.

1368
01:54:10,146 --> 01:54:13,146
"Child, why are you staring ?"

1369
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:17,150
Pick up my luggage?

1370
01:54:18,822 --> 01:54:21,557
Mammo Nani?

1371
01:54:21,558 --> 01:54:24,558
We thought that...
- I was dead.

1372
01:54:24,828 --> 01:54:27,828
There's strength still
in these old bones.

1373
01:54:30,166 --> 01:54:33,166
I will not die
that easily.

1374
01:54:33,570 --> 01:54:36,570
Ganny?
- Who is it?

1375
01:54:37,841 --> 01:54:40,841
"Who else will come
to you, silly."

1376
01:54:41,611 --> 01:54:44,611
It's me.
Mammo!

1377
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:52,119
I had given up hope.

1378
01:54:55,125 --> 01:54:58,125
She's begun to cry.
She should be happy.

1379
01:55:01,798 --> 01:55:03,632
I'm back now
to bother you.

1380
01:55:03,633 --> 01:55:06,135
Returned to go back again.

1381
01:55:06,136 --> 01:55:09,136
The police will take
you back again.

1382
01:55:09,139 --> 01:55:11,306
Now no one will catch me.

1383
01:55:11,307 --> 01:55:13,308
How long is your Visa for?

1384
01:55:13,309 --> 01:55:16,309
Forget the Visa.
Tell me about yourself.

1385
01:55:18,148 --> 01:55:21,148
What a handsome lad.

1386
01:55:24,154 --> 01:55:27,154
How many books have
you written?

1387
01:55:28,158 --> 01:55:30,826
Have you got him
married yet?

1388
01:55:30,827 --> 01:55:32,427
Where's his bride?

1389
01:55:32,428 --> 01:55:35,428
If only we could find
a nice enough girl.

1390
01:55:35,832 --> 01:55:38,832
Were I young I'd marry
him straightaway.

1391
01:55:43,273 --> 01:55:46,108
I'm here now so.

1392
01:55:46,109 --> 01:55:49,109
I'll find an angel
to light up this home.

1393
01:55:57,787 --> 01:56:00,122
Such a easy task.

1394
01:56:00,123 --> 01:56:03,123
"We should have done it then.
- I repeat, don't do all this."

1395
01:56:06,796 --> 01:56:08,797
If you are caught?

1396
01:56:08,798 --> 01:56:11,798
"Let it be. if you don't
wish to help me, don't."

1397
01:56:13,803 --> 01:56:16,803
"l will do it all, myself."

1398
01:56:16,806 --> 01:56:19,806
But listen carefully.
I will not go back.

1399
01:56:24,147 --> 01:56:26,548
"This time, no one
will dare ..."

1400
01:56:26,549 --> 01:56:29,549
handcuff Mehmooda Begum ...

1401
01:56:29,819 --> 01:56:32,819
.... and make her
cross the border.

1402
01:56:33,823 --> 01:56:36,823
Name.
Mehmooda Begum Ahmed Ali.

1403
01:56:36,826 --> 01:56:39,826
"Husband's name,
late Ahmed Ali Masood."

1404
01:56:40,096 --> 01:56:41,597
Age: 75.

1405
01:56:41,598 --> 01:56:43,765
"Resident of Lahore,
Pakistan."

1406
01:56:43,766 --> 01:56:46,766
"Died: May 25, 1994."

1407
01:56:48,271 --> 01:56:51,271
"Copy to Immigration Officer,
Bombay Police."

1408
01:56:58,514 --> 01:57:01,514
I am now a genie.
