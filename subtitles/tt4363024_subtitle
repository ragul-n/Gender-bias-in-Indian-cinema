{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

3
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:40,708
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

4
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:44,403
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

5
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:04,784
Halime!

6
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:09,468
Halime?

7
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:14,611
Halime!

8
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,683
Halime! Halime!

9
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:19,854
Halime!

10
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:23,546
-Halime!
-Halime!

11
00:12:29,777 --> 00:12:31,310
Halime. Halime.

12
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,879
Halime, my girl!

13
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:41,420
Hold down the rear! Let us separate.
We will meet in Aleppo!

14
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,486
We shall separate.

15
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:57,753
Halime.

16
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:01,653
-Sister?
-Come on, boy! Come on.

17
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,786
-Sister!
-Come on!

18
00:13:04,986 --> 00:13:07,153
-Sister.
-Come on, we are going.

19
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,753
Go on. Quick! Quick!

20
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:22,220
Sir, they are running away.

21
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:37,586
Ertugrul is trapped now...

22
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:42,620
...let us catch the small Shahzade
to please Ustad.

23
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,886
Get the horses.

24
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,586
You carry on, Shahzade.
I will catch up with you.

25
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:14,553
Come on. Come on!

26
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,020
Bey, you catch up with them.
We will guard your back.

27
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,520
Quick, to the horses!

28
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:54,686
That bitch called Selcan shall regret
the day she was born.

29
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,120
She will pay for the trick
she played on me dearly.

30
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,820
I shall breath down her neck like death.

31
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,820
There is no end to tricks in Selcan.

32
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:06,653
She walks in the tribe
like a ball of fire.

33
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:09,486
She bellows the fire anywhere she likes.

34
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,853
And if my name is Kurdoglu...

35
00:20:12,186 --> 00:20:14,886
...I know how to turn that fire into ash.

36
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,120
You shall take one life of
that double lived bitch.

37
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,853
Before she can hold her baby
in her arms...

38
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:27,653
...before she can brag about giving
a grandchild to the Bey bloodline...

39
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:29,620
...that baby shall die.

40
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:48,453
Get out of the way.

41
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:02,820
My dear lamb...

42
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:10,420
...I brought you water, get up.

43
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,853
Was it you...

44
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:25,086
...who killed my father Baybora?

45
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:31,853
Here you are, my girl.

46
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:43,653
May it be easy on you.

47
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:47,620
May it be easy on you, Baci.

48
00:21:48,086 --> 00:21:50,920
With God’s permission, we are ready,
Gundogdu Bey.

49
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,986
What happened, Bey? Is there something
that clouds your heart, that worries you?

50
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:04,420
There are dangers everywhere, Wild Demir.

51
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,153
I will allocate some trusted
Alps for your journey.

52
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:14,186
You are son of a Bey, you are a Bey.

53
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:17,153
You don’t need to tell me everything.

54
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,953
But if there is something
I need to know...

55
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,486
...you would tell me, right, my Bey?

56
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,720
I always say that caution is a virtue.

57
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,820
We cannot even trust the clouds on top
or the wind that blows.

58
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:38,986
Anyway, you should start
your own preparations.

59
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:43,786
Don’t talk like that, Bey.
What preparation a man like me can have?

60
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,220
I just need to say goodbye to someone,
while there is still time.

61
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:51,920
I will handle that in the mean time.

62
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:44,920
Yigit!

63
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:00,420
Yigit!

64
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,720
Was it you...

65
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,820
...who killed my father Baybora?

66
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,420
Baybora was like a brother to me.

67
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:57,586
Your father was killed by those who
see us as a threat to their Seigniory.

68
00:25:57,853 --> 00:25:59,486
What are you trying to say?

69
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,020
You should understand, the killer of
your father is Suleyman Shah.

70
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,953
Could those who we say Bey and Shah,
those who we crown, kill us, father?

71
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:22,620
But if I am your son...

72
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:24,886
...I shall make them pay for it.

73
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:48,153
Amen.

74
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:57,086
I am going, my dear wife.
We are migrating again.

75
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,520
The caravan is ready.

76
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,020
But this time,
you will not be in the caravan.

77
00:27:07,953 --> 00:27:10,153
You will not see our new homeland.

78
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,086
When we set up our camp, the first thing
we will do will be to wed Aykiz.

79
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,586
That day...

80
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:26,453
...I shall cry quietly in a corner.

81
00:27:28,186 --> 00:27:32,619
As you are not beside me,
you won’t be able to wipe my tears.

82
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:39,586
Aykiz will give me a grandson
when the time comes.

83
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:44,953
You won’t be able to hold
those little hands and feet.

84
00:27:47,853 --> 00:27:52,619
My battle worn and battered heart...

85
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,886
...will be even more worn out
being without you.

86
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:05,119
But no one will need to say:
“Come on. Get up, Wild  Demir.

87
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:11,753
Who will make weapons for
the Alps of this tribe other than you?”

88
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,486
Isn’t this world a temporary moorland
for everyone, my loved one?

89
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,486
When the time comes, I shall join
the caravan that goes to the real home.

90
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,020
We will meet then.

91
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:35,753
Knowing this is enough for me, my love.

92
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:45,653
The woman I saw the first time I opened my
eyes, the woman I gave my heart and loved.

93
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:51,086
Until then, while you are under
this cold ground...

94
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:59,053
...I shall be feeling cold even
in front of the ironsmith’s fire.

95
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:03,020
I wanted you to know that.
May God bless you.

96
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,886
My sincere condolences, son.

97
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,020
The world is like that.
An inn with two doors.

98
00:29:20,686 --> 00:29:25,220
Thank you,  Master Demir. The world is
the innkeeper, we are the travelers.

99
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,486
Those who finish the number of breaths
given to them go under the ground.

100
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:35,186
You are right, Bozok.
May God give you more patience.

101
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,720
Anyway, see you in the camp.
Peace be upon you.

102
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,020
Peace be upon you, Master Demir.
May you have a good journey.

103
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,453
-Yigit!
-Don’t move!

104
00:29:55,853 --> 00:29:58,120
Drop down the axe. I would cut his throat!

105
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:17,620
Tie him up.

106
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:32,586
Halt!

107
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,053
We need go faster, Shahzade.

108
00:31:35,653 --> 00:31:39,053
She loses more blood
as the horse goes faster, Ertugrul.

109
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,820
We shall rest here.

110
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:32,220
Ertugrul and the rest...

111
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,053
...you caught them...

112
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,786
...right?

113
00:32:39,086 --> 00:32:40,853
Sir, Ertugrul and others...

114
00:32:43,186 --> 00:32:45,486
Did you let them escape?

115
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,820
Sir, spare us.

116
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:35,686
Gokce, put these ointments
in a place we can find easily.

117
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:39,086
-We cannot waste time during the journey.
-Alright, mother.

118
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,620
Selcan, don’t lift heavy things.
God forbid, you have pains as it is.

119
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:54,420
Do you know what I think?

120
00:33:54,886 --> 00:33:58,553
It is not wise for you stay back with
the caravan while you are pregnant.

121
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:00,653
Come with us in this journey.

122
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:06,053
Thank you, mother.
I do not know what Gundogdu would say.

123
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,120
I do not think that he would oppose but...

124
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:13,653
...you are right, he is your Bey,
you should ask him.

125
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:19,986
You take the arms rack.

126
00:34:32,686 --> 00:34:33,953
Gundogdu...

127
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,420
...Mother Hayme says...

128
00:34:38,686 --> 00:34:41,853
...I do not want to worry,
you should come with us as well.

129
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,153
She is worried after last night.

130
00:34:44,953 --> 00:34:48,186
How come?
What happened last night for her to worry?

131
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:53,820
Because of my cramps. She is afraid that
I would get tired in the caravan...

132
00:34:53,986 --> 00:34:56,220
...and something might happen to the baby.

133
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,920
You are staying here as well.
After last night, I would get worried too.

134
00:35:09,553 --> 00:35:12,153
I want you to be in front of
my eyes all the time.

135
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:18,586
So you worry for my son.
You want to be beside him.

136
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,886
As you wish, Gundogdu.

137
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,370
We tried to stop the migration,
we did not succeed.

138
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:52,730
We tried to kill Shah Suleyman,
we did not succeed.

139
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,250
Don't mumble,
talk clearly so you can have inner peace.

140
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,770
In the morning you sent that rabid boy
to Shah Suleyman but now we are going...

141
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,410
...to bid him farewell.

142
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,570
I cannot see any logic
in your actions, Bey.

143
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,930
If my mind could only see one step beyond,
my name would be Alpargu as well, my lion.

144
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,770
My name is Kurdoglu because I can
calculate where the arrow will land...

145
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,850
...before it is even set on the bow.

146
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,850
What happened, sister?

147
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,450
It is good news, my sister, good news.

148
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,970
It is good for you to get
on the road with Mother Hayme...

149
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,090
...but you have to obtain
a good result from this journey.

150
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,250
You've been looking after Suleyman since
he fell ill. If you carry on like this...

151
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,850
...during the journey and be
the leading helper of Mother Hayme.

152
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,530
Of course, sister,
you can be rest assured.

153
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,410
My naive sister.
You will impress Mother Hayme so deeply...

154
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:11,330
...that she will not even think about
a bride other than you. You will remind...

155
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:15,530
...her that you will be marrying Ertugrul
so that she cannot go back on her word.

156
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,810
What about Ertugrul?

157
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,370
Does Mother Hayme not know
that his heart is with that girl?

158
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,130
A word comes out of the mouth once, Gokce.
It does not suit someone like...

159
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,810
...Mother Hayme to play with the pride
and kill the dreams of an innocent...

160
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,250
...well-intentioned girl like you. If she
forgets it, you shall remind her.

161
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,130
Sister, do you know why I am always
beside the sick bed of our Bey?

162
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:45,370
You once told me that Ertugrul
would never go against his father's words.

163
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,370
This will be over after our Bey says
that the two of us should get married.

164
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,490
That is why.

165
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,530
I always pray so that Shah Suleyman
can get better soon.

166
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,810
-He should get better and...
-God forbid!

167
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,490
Instead of worthless prayers like that
you should pray that Mother Hayme...

168
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,690
...stand strong in front of Ertugrul.

169
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:09,010
Do all that is in your power so that
she insists on you to be his bride.

170
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,330
May you find a remedy in the lands
you go to, if God permits.

171
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,890
May you find a remedy so that you can
greet your tribe standing strong...

172
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,610
...in our new lands.

173
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,930
Get really close.

174
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,330
I ask for your blessing, mother.

175
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,130
I bless you, my son.

176
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,690
My father is entrusted to God first,
then to you.

177
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:10,090
We don't know who is a friend
or enemy anymore.

178
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,410
There are many jackals on the road.
Be careful.

179
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:19,290
And may you succeed in protecting
your tribe, your wife and your child.

180
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,850
When there is no peace and unity within
the tribe, migration is even harder.

181
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,610
Your job is very difficult, son.
May God help you.

182
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,810
Thank you, mother. Do not worry, from
the babies to goats, all life here...

183
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,170
...is entrusted to me. We shall reach
Aleppo safe and sound, if God permits.

184
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,890
If God permits.

185
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,490
Come on, Alps. In the name of God.

186
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,570
May you flow like water, mother.
May troubles be left behind as you go.

187
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:26,690
May you be blessed with new weddings
and grandsons in our new lands.

188
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:29,530
If God permits, my girl. If God permits.

189
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,530
If God permits, we shall hear that
my blood brother has recovered.

190
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,330
May God clear your road for this journey,
Mother Hayme.

191
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:05,450
-To salvation, Mother Hayme.
-Alps will with be with you, Thank God.

192
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,970
But you should still be cautious.

193
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,890
As you know, the enemy is everywhere.

194
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,010
You do not need to think about us,
Kurdoglu.

195
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,450
Do not forget, Rahman.
You saw it with your own eyes last night.

196
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,090
Snakes do not use doors.

197
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,610
Hold tight.

198
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,290
Halt.

199
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,730
How is she, my Shahzade?

200
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,570
It would be wise to check her wound,
Ertugrul.

201
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,330
Press this over the wound.

202
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,330
We should not stay here for long.
It might be dangerous.

203
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:05,010
We should leave as soon as possible.
We shall find help in Aleppo.

204
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,250
Alright.

205
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,530
Ertugrul.

206
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,530
Will you be able to bear the pain, Halime?

207
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,610
I can, Ertugrul Bey.

208
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:35,250
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS TEMPLARS CASTLE

209
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,850
Please forgive my daughter
as she is innocent, Dear God.

210
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,970
Your Mercifulness has no limits.

211
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,970
You are The Most Just Revenger...

212
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,610
...You are The Winner.

213
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,690
You are The Most Powerful Revenger.

214
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,730
May You curse the tyrants.

215
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,570
I am not the tyrant here. You know that.

216
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,370
It was you who killed Elanora.

217
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,450
Even if you kill and
bring me back to life 40 times...

218
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,250
...you shall not get
what you want from me.

219
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,170
You were like this as a child as well.

220
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:27,090
Stubbornness makes you unlovable.

221
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,090
But I know how to break that stubbornness.

222
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,650
I am getting old, Marcus.

223
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:41,610
What was the name of the Bedouin
we met in Aleppo yesterday?

224
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,570
The famous Muhiddin Ibn Arabi
from Andalucía.

225
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:52,050
Instead of killing you 40 times, if I kill
him only once, would that break your will?

226
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,010
We both know that you cannot kill him.

227
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:06,530
You are right. You were stubborn and
clever like this as a child as well.

228
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:13,010
In order to get my hands on that chest,
I need both of you alive.

229
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:20,890
But this does not mean that I cannot throw
him in the dungeon opposite yours.

230
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,330
Will you be able to bear seeing him
getting weak day by day?

231
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,410
{\an8}ALEPPO

232
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,250
Take this as well.

233
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,730
-May it be easy on you, Aykiz.
-Thank you.

234
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,570
How is our Bey?

235
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,690
-He will be better, if God permits.
-If God permits.

236
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:11,970
Is this your dowry?

237
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:17,330
The first wedding of
the new camp will be yours.

238
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,410
If God permits,
the second will be mine with Ertugrul.

239
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:29,130
Gokce, I know that
your heart is with Ertugrul...

240
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:34,090
...but you know very well
that he sees you as his little sister.

241
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,690
You start dreaming on your own
and start to believe your own dreams...

242
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,730
...you will be heartbroken at the end.

243
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,450
You are wrong, Aykiz.
This is not an illusion.

244
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:49,610
Shah Suleyman also told Ertugrul.

245
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,370
He told Ertugrul that
we shall get married after the migration.

246
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,930
Come on, get ready! Our journey begins!

247
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,010
Do you think Ertugrul would accept this?

248
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,970
His heart is with Halime.

249
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:08,770
You need to be blind
if you don't know or see it.

250
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,970
Please do not be so confident about this.

251
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:18,130
These things rely on fate and fortune.

252
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,610
Of course they do.
The world has so many possibilities.

253
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:27,610
Look at Turgut and yourself.
You've been sweethearts since childhood...

254
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,970
...but you are still not together.
Don't you forget about this, Aykiz.

255
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:42,210
On the way to the groom's house, the bride
still says "whatever fate may hold."

256
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,530
You will either talk here and now...

257
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,770
...or I shall feed you to the dogs.

258
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,850
I know that someone helped you
within the palace...

259
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:27,210
...give me a name...

260
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,690
...save your life.

261
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,130
What is happening to this man?

262
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:45,290
This is poison!
Where did he find the poison?

263
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,090
-Did anyone enter here apart from you?
-I don't think so.

264
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,210
No one knew he was here.

265
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:57,170
Even the guards don't know
who they are guarding.

266
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,610
I could not get a single word out of him.

267
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:04,130
I have to find the spies
who infiltrated the palace.

268
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:06,330
Esma...

269
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,970
...no one should see this body.

270
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,770
Whoever helped him die will come again
to see whether he died or not.

271
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,370
Efendi...

272
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,250
...with your permission...

273
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,450
...I can take care of the body.

274
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:29,730
I know how to take him out of here during
change of guard without anyone seeing.

275
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:35,410
Esma...

276
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,250
...I don't know how to repay my debt.

277
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:45,130
You saved my life once and
now you are risking your life for me.

278
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:49,530
It is an honor for me to work for
the vizier who sacrifices everything...

279
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:53,610
...for the righteous path of God.
You can be rest assured.

280
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,850
With God's permission, the traitor
who did this shall be punished.

281
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:36,610
Petruccio, my dear friend.

282
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,850
Cardinal.

283
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,290
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

284
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,850
I hope your niece's death was not in vain.

285
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:51,370
Elanora sacrificed herself for our cause.

286
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,450
Was your niece's sacrifice beneficial?

287
00:53:56,130 --> 00:54:00,450
I don't think so. You are not even
a step closer to the lost chest.

288
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,730
Giovanni is still resisting...

289
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,930
...but he shall give in soon.

290
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,370
I know his soft spot very well.

291
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:18,090
How can you be so sure
that Giovanni will start talking?

292
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:21,490
I can tell our common friends in Aleppo.

293
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:26,810
-With your brother?
-No. Giovanni is not my brother anymore.

294
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,850
He chose to betray our cause.

295
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,570
And he is paying the price of this choice.

296
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:39,210
Petruccio, Petruccio,
not only the traitors...

297
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:43,250
...those who cannot succeed
in their duties also pay a price.

298
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:58,810
If you want me to persuade
our Holy Father for the Crusades...

299
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,690
...you have to take back the holy relics
Muslims stole from us.

300
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,210
I shall remind you of this everyday
until I return to Europe...

301
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,850
...my dear friend Petruccio.

302
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:16,810
-What is it, Marcus?
-Titus has returned to the castle, sir.

303
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,210
Get your hands off me!

304
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,330
Let go!

305
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,210
Well done!

306
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:35,010
You went with 30 knights and
returned with two Turkmen, dear Titus.

307
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,210
Big job, big success.

308
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,330
This child is not
an ordinary Turkmen, Cardinal.

309
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:46,730
He is a Seljuk Shahzade.

310
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:51,290
Isn't he one of the Shahzades
you let escape last time?

311
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,690
Well, who is this?

312
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,810
Your death!

313
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:23,450
Well done, Titus. You are
quite brave against a wounded lion...

314
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:28,410
...but when you encounter lions in the
forest, who'll look for a hole to hide?

315
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:35,130
I am going to Antioch.
I have some business to attend to.

316
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:40,170
I shall take back my guest when I get
back. Look after him well while I am gone.

317
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,770
May you have a good journey, dear Thomas.

318
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,450
Take our guest to his palace.

319
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:59,690
Take him to the palace as well.

320
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:04,850
This presumptuous Turkmen
shall beg for me to kill him.

321
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:19,050
First we shall visit a friend.
He will look after Halime and...

322
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,370
...we will receive his blessing.
-Alright.

323
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,650
Be strong, my girl. We are almost there.

324
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:57,730
You cowards! Why don't you untie me?
Are you afraid?

325
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,530
Do we treat your prisoners like this?

326
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,890
-Are you fine?
-Save your breath, young man.

327
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,810
They won't hear you here.
They won't understand your troubles.

328
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:14,730
Here, only God will hear you.

329
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,490
Who are you?

330
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:26,930
I warned you many times!

331
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:33,810
I told you that your personal revenge
should not overshadow your tasks!

332
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,570
But you went after that Turk anyway.

333
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:45,370
I lost 30 knights
because of your incompetence.

334
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:48,970
Forgive me, sir.

335
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:53,770
Didn't you see how
the cardinal was teasing us?

336
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:59,050
You humiliated me and
all the Templar Knights.

337
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,050
Never...

338
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,970
...ever ask me to forgive you once again.

339
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,410
I understand, sir.

340
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,970
-But...
-But what, Titus?

341
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:18,330
Ertugrul was going to Aleppo.
I thought you might want to know this.

342
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:25,090
He must be going to Aziz's palace
as an envoy of the Kayis.

343
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,410
I shall give you once last chance, Titus.

344
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,970
What is it you want me to do, sir?

345
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,930
Go to Aleppo immediately.

346
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:45,290
Talk with Nasir and finish this job.

347
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,410
Then clean your own mess.

348
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:51,770
I understand, sir.

349
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:56,570
First complete your tasks
for the Son of God, Titus.

350
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,730
Then, Ertugrul is yours.

351
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,330
You can do whatever you wish.

352
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,490
-Thank God you are here.
-Thank God we meet again.

353
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,050
Where were you, Bey?

354
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,730
We were worried when you did not show up.

355
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,690
Where is Turgut Alp?

356
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:21,130
-Father, where is Yigit? He is not here.
-Keep calm, keep calm, my girl.

357
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:24,610
I will call the doctor and
meet you in the lodge.

358
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:11,410
May the Son of God greet our dead brother
in His kingdom up in heaven.

359
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:15,570
Will his death make our job easier?

360
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,530
Aziz is really confused
about Sahabettin at the moment.

361
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:25,170
When the assassin is found dead
after accusing Sahabettin...

362
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,090
...this will confuse him even more.

363
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:33,810
The rest is up to you.

364
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:38,890
You must feed fears
and suspicions within Aziz.

365
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:44,010
I will be a guest of
the emir tonight as well.

366
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:48,370
In the sweetest moment of our night
I shall whisper Ustad's words in his ear.

367
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,810
He will be my slave from now on.

368
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,090
Eftalya.

369
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:57,090
Don't get carried away
while doing your job.

370
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:07,170
I am Esma to El Aziz and
Eftalya to you and your Templar Knights.

371
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,490
I'm only doing my job.

372
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:21,530
Shall I take the tray
if you won't eat, Efendi?

373
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:50,650
Father?

374
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:56,530
Yigit still has not arrived, father.

375
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,450
Father, Yigit has not arrived.

376
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,450
May God help and be with us.

377
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,690
Dear God,
please don't leave us in despair.

378
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:24,170
Amen. She shall recover.
May God bestow a speedy recovery upon her.

379
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:28,050
Hanim, how is our guest?

380
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:32,690
The doctor said that she should regain
consciousness by the morning, God willing.

381
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,690
We should go to the hall.
Our sheikh would like to see you.

382
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,130
Is Ibn Arabi here?

383
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,610
You can go, Ertugrul. I will wait here.

384
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:24,410
What is this outrage?
How can you come in without permission?

385
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:30,770
Kurdoglu, people are entering the marquee
not by the door but from the back...

386
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:34,490
...and you still request permission.

387
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:38,690
Get to the point, Gundogdu.
Say what you have to say.

388
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:43,210
I will not say anything to you until
my father opens his eyes, Kurdoglu.

389
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:46,970
But when he opens his eyes,
not even the candles...

390
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:51,530
...even if all the stars in heaven go out,
no one can take you away from me.

391
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,490
In the mean time...

392
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:00,010
...a bow and arrow are good.

393
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:04,090
You don't need to get face to face
like you do with a sword or a dagger.

394
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,490
Welcome, son.

395
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:46,450
You are always welcome here.

396
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:52,370
I am joyous I saw you.

397
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:06,130
May she recover soon. Our master's
grandson told us what happened.

398
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:14,170
Efendi, when I first came to Aleppo,
the Templar Knights wanted to kill me...

399
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:19,250
...but we were saved with your help.
I saw you in my dream.

400
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:24,770
Help is from God, don't ever forget
that He is the source of all favors...

401
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:28,410
...and don't ever tell
your brothers your dreams.

402
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,570
His highness Joseph also had a dream.

403
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:38,210
He told it to his father
for him to interpret it.

404
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:42,050
What was Prophet Jacob's
first reply to him?

405
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:46,210
Do not tell your brothers your dreams.

406
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,090
Do not forget...

407
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:55,370
...if you don't keep one secret, the Owner
of Secrets will not give you another one.

408
01:10:57,970 --> 01:10:59,210
I understand.

409
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,130
Look, our guest is here.

410
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:11,170
He has secrets,
he respects the Owner of Secrets.

411
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:27,290
May God keep his blessing over us.

412
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:32,650
It was Sultan Geylani's statement:
"Birds fly with their own kind.

413
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:37,050
Eagles with eagles, crows with crows."

414
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:41,130
Our job was to bring the eagles together.

415
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:47,050
Thank God.

416
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:59,930
You are entrusted first in God,
then with each other.

417
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,090
You can discuss everything together.

418
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:22,450
What do the Templars want from you?

419
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:36,130
Brother Dogan?

420
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,090
Yes, my brother?

421
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:46,090
Do you think Alp Turgut and
Yigit will be here in the morning?

422
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,370
I do not know, Brother Bamsi.

423
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:58,570
We fended off so many troubles
while we were together.

424
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,890
The Mongols and Crusaders...

425
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:05,170
...wolves and bears...

426
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,330
...snow and winter did not stop us.

427
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,570
So those knights would have...

428
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,690
I do not know, Brother Bamsi.

429
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,450
My tongue cannot say
what is in my heart...

430
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:25,850
...my heart cannot accept
what my tongue might say.

431
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:31,930
Where is this Bey Afsin? He said he would
be back by nightfall but he is not.

432
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:35,890
I do not know that either, Brother Bamsi.

433
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:40,090
We do not know anything about him.
May God bless us with a good ending.

434
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:47,090
Is it true that there is
a black death plague in the Kayi tribe?

435
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:49,010
Plague?

436
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:52,930
I was surprised when I heard it as well.

437
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:56,450
But our commander Nasir said that
he got such an intelligence.

438
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:59,530
There was no plague when I left the tribe.

439
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:03,490
But we caught someone who was trying
to contaminate the tribe's food...

440
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:05,130
...with plagued meat.

441
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:08,210
She said that the Templars had ordered it.

442
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:11,170
Are they under every stone we turn?

443
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:16,930
If the news of a plague
in our tribe reached Aleppo before me...

444
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,970
...it means that
the Templars are behind it.

445
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,530
How much do you trust
this commander called Nasir?

446
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,410
I do not trust anyone
in the palace anymore, Ertugrul.

447
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:38,530
When I was just about to catch
the man who tried to kill me...

448
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:50,730
Stop, don't!

449
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:56,530
Nasir killed him for no reason at all.

450
01:14:58,210 --> 01:14:59,970
That man did not die.

451
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:03,130
I questioned him when he recovered.

452
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:06,890
But yesterday,
he killed himself right before my eyes.

453
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:11,530
What do you plan to do?

454
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:16,250
First thing tomorrow
I will tell El Aziz about Nasir.

455
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:21,970
My nephew will not turn
a deaf ear to my warnings this time.

456
01:09:03,262 --> 01:09:05,702
Do not touch her.
Do not touch and move away.

457
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:11,378
Midwife, what is happening?
For the love of God please help her.

458
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,566
Be patient, my soul

459
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,700
Don’t expect a remedy to your problem

460
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:42,566
Don’t throw yourself into a fire
and expect your lover to save you

461
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:49,033
Pearls of tears weep through
the mother of pearl of your eyes

462
01:15:49,566 --> 01:15:53,800
Don’t expect anything from
the female with coral pearl lips

463
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:58,033
Come, do not rejoice

464
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,300
and cry, poor nightingale

465
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:07,833
Don’t expect anything from
the female with a mouth like rose garden

466
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,833
My Esma? My beautiful eyes?

467
01:16:15,266 --> 01:16:16,866
My silky face?

468
01:16:17,766 --> 01:16:19,533
Why are you so down?

469
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:22,000
What is it that bothers you?

470
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,200
Didn’t you like the poem?

471
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:31,300
Is it possible for me to not like a poem
from that enchanting voice of yours?

472
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,933
Is it possible for me to fall
into the darkness...

473
01:16:40,133 --> 01:16:42,300
...while you shine my night by being here?

474
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,233
Don’t you know how anxious I wait for
the time we can be together and rejoice.

475
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,600
Well?

476
01:16:47,766 --> 01:16:49,900
What is your trouble then? Tell me.

477
01:16:54,933 --> 01:16:58,900
I seal my lips as I am afraid
that I might be presumptuous.

478
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:05,933
My Esma.

479
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,100
Tell me.

480
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:16,733
-Sahabettin.
-I don’t understand. Sahabettin?

481
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,666
Did he do something to you?

482
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:22,500
-Did he...
-No, not like that.

483
01:17:22,933 --> 01:17:26,066
I am only a loyal and
trusted servant in his eyes.

484
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,733
But this is my fear.

485
01:17:31,533 --> 01:17:34,833
I fear that I might have sinned
because of him, my sultan.

486
01:17:40,066 --> 01:17:42,500
He trusts me more than anyone else.

487
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:46,600
All the secrets he hides from others,
he shares with me.

488
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,800
He didn’t even hide
the assassin from me, my sultan.

489
01:17:57,033 --> 01:17:59,166
I was taking food to him every day.

490
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,233
But today...

491
01:18:04,933 --> 01:18:06,533
...the man...

492
01:18:06,866 --> 01:18:09,833
...died with foams
coming out of his mouth.

493
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,000
I think he was poisoned, my sultan.

494
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:17,733
Why didn’t you tell me, Esma?

495
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:21,966
I was afraid.

496
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:25,733
-And I am still afraid.
-What are you afraid of?

497
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,166
If Sahabettin...

498
01:18:30,066 --> 01:18:33,833
...poisoned that man with
the food I took there...

499
01:18:35,533 --> 01:18:37,766
What if I gave that poison...

500
01:18:39,066 --> 01:18:41,733
...and committed a sin by killing him?

501
01:18:44,966 --> 01:18:48,000
It is alright, do not worry.

502
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:53,733
My sultan...

503
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:57,000
...I knew that he was not an
innocent man...

504
01:18:57,633 --> 01:18:59,966
...but why didn’t he punish him himself?

505
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:02,200
Why did he hide it from me?

506
01:19:03,633 --> 01:19:06,100
I have not even harmed
an ant until this day.

507
01:19:07,533 --> 01:19:09,700
-You know my heart.
-Okay.

508
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,966
-I can’t even step on an ant.
-It is alright.

509
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:17,600
May God forgive me.

510
01:19:19,766 --> 01:19:21,500
What if I sinned and...

511
01:19:22,066 --> 01:19:23,700
...killed him?

512
01:19:24,133 --> 01:19:27,233
It is alright. Do not worry.

513
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,700
It is over.

514
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:34,900
Do not worry.

515
01:19:35,066 --> 01:19:36,233
It is over.

516
01:19:36,633 --> 01:19:37,800
Do not worry.

517
01:19:39,033 --> 01:19:40,200
It is over.

518
01:19:53,066 --> 01:19:55,633
My daughter...

519
01:19:57,066 --> 01:19:59,566
...looks like the moon.

520
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:05,500
Her eyebrows are like...

521
01:20:06,566 --> 01:20:08,666
...a stretched bow.

522
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,733
When she waves her hair...

523
01:20:20,033 --> 01:20:25,633
...she looks like a pony with long mare.

524
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:33,733
There will be a feast soon...

525
01:20:36,533 --> 01:20:42,733
...her face will shine up the room.

526
01:20:45,066 --> 01:20:49,900
She is just like a son...

527
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:57,500
...who will be a valiant Bey.

528
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,566
Hayme?

529
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,300
Hayme?

530
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,733
Mother Hayme? Mother Hayme, wake up.

531
01:21:20,866 --> 01:21:24,066
-What happened, my girl?
-Do now panic, mother, it is good news.

532
01:21:24,766 --> 01:21:26,733
Suleyman Shah called your name.

533
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,666
Bey? Bey?

534
01:21:30,733 --> 01:21:32,166
Bey, I am here.

535
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:37,933
-Did he say anything else?
-No, mother.

536
01:21:38,133 --> 01:21:39,866
He only said your name.

537
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:58,666
My girl, may God bless you.

538
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:02,100
You suffer with us.

539
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,666
You did not stay with your sister...

540
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:07,800
...you set on the road with us.

541
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:12,666
Please do not say that, Mother Hayme.
I see Suleyman Shah as my father as well.

542
01:22:13,266 --> 01:22:15,966
He has every right over me and my sister.

543
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,233
Moreover...

544
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,600
...I will be his bride soon.

545
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,866
I will call him father.

546
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:28,066
I pray to God every time I see you two.

547
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,533
I pray to God for a life like
yours for Ertugrul and I.

548
01:22:35,233 --> 01:22:39,833
When I learned that you found me suitable
for Ertugrul and wanted me as a bride...

549
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:43,066
...I was honored.
-Gokce.

550
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:47,666
It is late now.

551
01:22:47,966 --> 01:22:49,533
You are very tired.

552
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,200
Go and sleep, my girl.

553
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,300
I am sorry, Mother Hayme.

554
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,166
I was tactless.

555
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,000
-I only...
-Gokce.

556
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:09,066
Look, my girl. This is a matter of fate.

557
01:23:10,033 --> 01:23:12,566
It cannot be realized by my wishes.

558
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:17,066
Fate is what God has written for us.

559
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:19,533
Do you understand?

560
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:25,533
Go on, go and rest for a bit. Come on.

561
01:24:19,633 --> 01:24:23,633
Do not fear, my Shahzade.
You will not be subjected to this.

562
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,866
You come from a noble blood.

563
01:24:30,066 --> 01:24:31,633
Let my Turgut Aga go.

564
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:38,866
Noble people cannot be sad
over the fates of their slaves.

565
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,733
They can only be anxious for their cause.

566
01:24:49,566 --> 01:24:52,600
You cowards!
Kill me without playing around!

567
01:24:52,866 --> 01:24:57,500
Your end will not be so easy, Turkmen.
You will beg...

568
01:24:58,566 --> 01:25:00,033
...but you will live.

569
01:25:00,533 --> 01:25:02,633
In a way I want you to.

570
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,066
I have only one live and
it is borrowed from God.

571
01:25:08,733 --> 01:25:10,633
How can you scare me?

572
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:14,533
Sometimes people even get scared
from themselves.

573
01:25:16,966 --> 01:25:23,166
If they don’t fear for themselves, they
fear for the lives of their loved ones.

574
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,166
Isn’t that so, Giovanni?

575
01:25:45,866 --> 01:25:49,566
Valiant boy.
Do not trust your youth and courage.

576
01:25:50,733 --> 01:25:52,300
This is not a struggle.

577
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:58,133
There is no one here
other than God who can hear you.

578
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,200
Dear God...

579
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,100
...be my side and help me.

580
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:16,766
As you get desperate,
remember that God is The Ultimate Decider.

581
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:25,033
While you starve, recite that
He is The Giver of Prosperity.

582
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,733
You are with your God here.
Do not forget this.

583
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:37,100
And know that you are
in the School of Joseph.

584
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:41,933
If you turn your back on God
and turn to yourself...

585
01:26:42,266 --> 01:26:46,233
...they will make you so that
you fear from your own self.

586
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,300
I will succeed with this miserable Turk
where I failed with Giovanni.

587
01:27:35,733 --> 01:27:38,933
How long do you think it will take
for him to give in, sir?

588
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:44,100
According to the methods in this book,
he can only resist for 40 days.

589
01:27:44,566 --> 01:27:45,833
And then?

590
01:27:47,133 --> 01:27:49,933
I was not aware of your arrival,
dear Thomas.

591
01:27:53,266 --> 01:27:55,300
You are like the angel of death.

592
01:27:57,566 --> 01:27:59,833
You showed up suddenly once again.

593
01:28:00,533 --> 01:28:02,033
How are our guests?

594
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,600
They are resting in their quarters.

595
01:28:06,566 --> 01:28:10,033
Are you going to be victorious
through the mice you put in dungeons?

596
01:28:11,133 --> 01:28:13,866
Even I have a hard time
in understanding you.

597
01:28:24,233 --> 01:28:25,866
Dear Thomas...

598
01:28:27,033 --> 01:28:30,266
...I do not stick my nose
at your business in Europe.

599
01:28:31,033 --> 01:28:33,700
And you should not dwell
in the matters here.

600
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:39,066
That is your decision. I am merely
trying to convince our Holy Father...

601
01:28:39,233 --> 01:28:40,966
...to a new Crusade.

602
01:28:41,866 --> 01:28:48,666
I will find Ibn Arabi’s chest and
the sacred relics inside sooner or later.

603
01:28:49,566 --> 01:28:53,633
This is a promise and
the Son of God may be my witness.

604
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,866
But I will not do it
with knights like Titus.

605
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:03,200
I will do it through people who think
they are still Turks but...

606
01:29:03,533 --> 01:29:09,266
...I shall decide on what they shall be.
-How will you accomplish this?

607
01:29:12,233 --> 01:29:15,100
With an old Asian legend.

608
01:29:29,266 --> 01:29:32,166
We are about to pick
the fruit of our hard work.

609
01:29:32,866 --> 01:29:37,500
The Vizier is as good as dead
for El Aziz now. Aleppo will remember...

610
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:41,133
...Sahabettin as a traitor
who collaborated with the Crusaders.

611
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:48,533
And I will reveal this betrayal and become
his highness Ameer’ s only trusted aide.

612
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,600
What about Ertugrul?

613
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,066
I mean Kayis...

614
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,033
...and their territory?

615
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,633
It will be resolved today, right?

616
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:05,733
Don’t you worry about it. El Aziz is
a puppet, which I hold the strings now.

617
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:10,633
Ertugrul will leave that palace
as a man who lost everything.

618
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:14,800
No, my friend. You are mistaken.

619
01:30:16,033 --> 01:30:21,133
Ertugrul will understand
what he lost when he meets us.

620
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:40,233
Ertugrul?

621
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,833
Great God!

622
01:30:48,233 --> 01:30:49,733
Ertugrul, be careful.

623
01:30:53,966 --> 01:30:55,600
Ertugrul, be careful.

624
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:11,533
I thank God. You are better now.

625
01:31:13,066 --> 01:31:14,300
Father?

626
01:31:15,833 --> 01:31:17,533
Father, where is Yigit?

627
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,666
Did something happen to Yigit,
where is my brother?

628
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,800
No, my dear girl. Nothing happened to him.
He is with the Alps.

629
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:29,800
Calm down, your wound might
start to bleed.

630
01:31:31,233 --> 01:31:32,800
Where are we, father?

631
01:31:34,233 --> 01:31:37,666
We reached Aleppo, my girl.
We are at a secure place.

632
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,300
Father, why is Yigit not with us?

633
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,033
I want to see my brother.

634
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,566
You will see him tomorrow, my girl.

635
01:31:50,766 --> 01:31:52,733
Sleep now. You should sleep.

636
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,066
Sleep and rest.

637
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:02,600
Dear God...

638
01:32:02,733 --> 01:32:07,000
...spare these innocents.
Bring Yigit to us safe and sound.

639
01:32:32,266 --> 01:32:36,900
The servant told the truth.
The man is indeed poisoned, your highness.

640
01:33:21,933 --> 01:33:25,933
Akcakoca, what kind of a disaster
this plague is?

641
01:33:27,633 --> 01:33:30,566
Didn’t we kill all those sheep
to fend it off?

642
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,166
We did, Bey. We did but...

643
01:33:35,533 --> 01:33:39,300
...this is a child’s doing. She couldn’t
sacrifice her lamb and hid it.

644
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,800
We set on the road tomorrow.
What will happen to these people?

645
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:51,900
Bey, there is nothing we can do for them.

646
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,733
In a few days they will...

647
01:33:58,166 --> 01:33:59,866
Will we leave them here?

648
01:34:00,866 --> 01:34:02,600
I will stay with them.

649
01:34:04,866 --> 01:34:07,233
Bey, I know there is nothing I can do...

650
01:34:07,566 --> 01:34:09,933
...but I can relieve their pain
for a while.

651
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,700
Akcakoca...

652
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:21,133
...there are some who don’t want to
migrate. I need to talk to them.

653
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:24,200
If they stay here, it would be a disaster.

654
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,133
Whatever happens, they need to know this.

655
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:31,200
May God make it easy for you.

656
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:10,766
Your highness Ameer.

657
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,533
I brought the gratitude of Kayi tribe
and my father Suleyman Shah’s regards...

658
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,700
...for the new home you have given us.

659
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,200
About your tribe...

660
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:48,266
...some rumors have
reached my ears.

661
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,933
Are you going to say anything
about them, Ertugrul?

662
01:35:54,866 --> 01:35:57,733
I talked with your vizier
Sahabettin Tugrul as well...

663
01:35:58,066 --> 01:35:59,766
...these rumors are lies.

664
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,900
Templars who are not fond of the alliance
between us attacked our tribe.

665
01:36:05,866 --> 01:36:09,533
Those who tried to spread disease
in our tribe and the people...

666
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:11,866
...who spread these rumors are the same.

667
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,566
You are lying, Ertugrul.

668
01:36:43,233 --> 01:36:48,533
The enemy who you think is beyond your
borders are actually inside your palace.

669
01:36:49,633 --> 01:36:50,966
You are not aware.

670
01:37:22,533 --> 01:37:23,900
Your highness...

671
01:37:32,933 --> 01:37:34,966
What are you doing here, Nasir?

672
01:37:35,766 --> 01:37:37,700
Where is his highness the Ameer?

673
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,766
Guards.

674
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:51,733
How dare you?

675
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:55,500
Inform El Aziz immediately.

676
01:37:56,566 --> 01:37:57,966
Calm down, Vizier.

677
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,300
This is actually the order of
his highness the Ameer.

678
01:38:03,066 --> 01:38:05,500
He personally wants to question you.

679
01:38:18,866 --> 01:38:20,200
Is Kurdoglu not here?

680
01:38:21,666 --> 01:38:23,600
I do not know where he is, Bey.

681
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:28,100
He told me to pack his belongings
and make them ready for the caravan.

682
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,966
He is to solve an important matter
and join the caravan later.

683
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:36,733
He will join the caravan you say.
So Kurdoglu Bey will migrate with us.

684
01:38:37,766 --> 01:38:42,533
Alpargu, tell me. Your Bey does not
do anything without informing you.

685
01:38:43,166 --> 01:38:45,000
I really do not know, Bey.

686
01:38:45,233 --> 01:38:48,733
He only said that it was
about Suleyman Shah...

687
01:38:49,666 --> 01:38:51,000
...that was all.

688
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,266
The cart shook him up more than
we expected, Mother Hayme.

689
01:39:24,566 --> 01:39:27,966
You are right, Master Demir.
It is good that we stopped to rest.

690
01:39:28,233 --> 01:39:30,733
The horses will have a chance to
rest as well.

691
01:39:33,633 --> 01:39:37,100
May God give him health,
so that he can walk while entering Aleppo.

692
01:39:38,033 --> 01:39:39,233
If God permits.

693
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,900
-Hayme.
-Bey!

694
01:40:08,933 --> 01:40:10,200
Bey!

695
01:40:24,033 --> 01:40:25,266
Bey?

696
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:55,666
Come on, my girl. Stand back so that
our Bey can breathe freely.

697
01:41:32,881 --> 01:41:35,681
Tell me, why is the Ameer not coming?

698
01:41:38,541 --> 01:41:42,441
I really do not know why his highness
is acting like this, my Vizier.

699
01:41:43,175 --> 01:41:47,475
I have insisted repeatedly
but he did not want to talk.

700
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:51,764
But he gave you an assurance.

701
01:41:51,851 --> 01:41:54,751
You shall be tried justly.

702
01:41:56,036 --> 01:42:01,103
And I shall be personally responsible
for your just trial.

703
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:06,918
You may leave, Nasir.

704
01:42:28,181 --> 01:42:29,847
Dear God...

705
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,460
...I am ready to be hurt,
but don’t let the justice be hurt.

706
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:40,086
Do not give the tyrants an opportunity.

707
01:42:42,154 --> 01:42:44,921
The tyrant may kill me if he wishes...

708
01:42:46,093 --> 01:42:51,226
...but the order that shall dignify
Your name may live until eternity, my God.

709
01:43:28,558 --> 01:43:29,858
Turkmen brave.

710
01:43:30,843 --> 01:43:32,076
Ertugrul Bey.

711
01:43:36,717 --> 01:43:38,817
You won’t regret it if you turn around.

712
01:44:02,793 --> 01:44:07,060
Efendi Titus says: “The eagle is in
the cage, now it is the wolf’s turn.”
