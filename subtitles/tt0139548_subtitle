3
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:07,767
"You are the creator of the world."

4
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:12,167
"You are the
caretaker of the world."

5
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:17,036
"Hey, omniscient."

6
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:23,226
"You are the time."

7
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:27,807
"You are the one with the wheel."

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:36,050
"Please accept our prayers."

9
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,113
Ever since we have got married..

10
00:02:58,388 --> 00:02:59,988
You just keep
doing this all the time.

11
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:04,280
I ask you. Don't you have
anything else to do apart from this?

12
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:12,393
Meena, Chimanbhai Suratwala
doesn't need to work.

13
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,593
It's been a whole 11 and
half months and three days..

14
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:16,831
Since we got married.

15
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,873
But still there is no result.

16
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:21,273
Various kids are
hanging on the walls.

17
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:23,033
I have been crying
hoarse that pick up..

18
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:25,713
A child from there and
throw him into my lap.

19
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:27,593
You can't feed your own mouth.

20
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:28,849
You still live in
your in-law's house.

21
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:31,113
What will you feed
him if I have a baby?

22
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,346
But since I'm already being supported
by my brother-in-law's sister..

23
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,672
So, what difference does it make?

24
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,520
You two mean the same to me.

25
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:37,685
Shut up!

26
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:40,565
You don't trust me?

27
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:43,245
Come, peep into my heart. Look.

28
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:44,685
Come on, look.

29
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:46,525
- Brother-in-law.
- Yes.

30
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:48,405
He has spoilt the fun.

31
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:49,861
These brother-in-laws
always act as barriers..

32
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,600
Between the husband and wife.

33
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:53,285
You just move ahead and bang..

34
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,419
Come. Come, Brother-in-law.

35
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,565
Brother-in-law, what
the hell is happening?

36
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,639
I was working out.

37
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,685
You are indeed
packing on some muscles.

38
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,401
I have already used the motor.

39
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,285
Now, what remains are the push-ups.

40
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:09,005
Carry on with your
push-ups till evening.

41
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,402
- By then I'll be back from work.
- Very well.

42
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:14,893
Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law.

43
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:15,890
What is it, Brother-in-law?

44
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:17,241
I forgot something.

45
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,577
Get a bottle of Gripe
water while coming home.

46
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,501
These days my health has
started deteriorating.

47
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:26,111
My sweet little brother-in-law,
how about Dongre's almond sweet?

48
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:27,892
No. I will have only Gripe water.

49
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,377
Is it? I'll get you a bottle.

50
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:36,052
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

51
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,551
- Any letters?
- Yes.

52
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:39,126
- Then send it to me.
- Yes.

53
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:58,101
- Here.
- Why did you take the trouble?

54
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,003
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

55
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,996
Ms. Vandana, how come your
letter is in my pile of letters?

56
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,130
My letter? And here.

57
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,810
Gosh! This is in Urdu.

58
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:24,730
Please read it out for me. Please.

59
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:29,090
What happened?

60
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,770
It is quite a dangerous letter.

61
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:33,530
Dangerous. Read it. Please.

62
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,972
- Darling.
- Yes.

63
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,610
I'm not saying that.
It's mentioned in this.

64
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:43,610
Oh. Go on.

65
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,130
Ever since I have seen you,
I've been smitten by you.

66
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,410
I'm lost in your
thoughts day and night.

67
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,130
You are my life. I worship you.

68
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:58,730
- Really.
- Yes.

69
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,370
- Should I believe that?
- Believe what?

70
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,480
What are you saying?

71
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,330
I'm only reading.

72
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:10,266
Sometimes try writing as well.

73
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,450
Please do write the same thing.

74
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:18,970
Oh. Now, I get it.

75
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:23,131
- A new prank.
- Obviously.

76
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,740
Sir, the boss has called you.

77
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,671
Okay. When did sir come?

78
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:28,817
Quite a while ago?

79
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:29,902
Is everything okay?

80
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,871
He is overhauling his son.

81
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:34,157
Oh.

82
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,287
Now, I won't let you
have your way anymore.

83
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,427
Rs. 20,000 went
missing two months ago.

84
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:40,016
Last month, Rs.10000.

85
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:42,736
And this month,
Rs.50,000 can't be accounted for.

86
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:44,813
I ask you what you have
splurged the money on.

87
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,536
Father, I'm extremely sorry.

88
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,656
I can't recollect
anything in spite..

89
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,816
Of straining
every bit of my brain.

90
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,655
You have made my life miserable.

91
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,959
You make me suffer all the time.

92
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:56,407
Father, I should be the
one complaining about that.

93
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:57,704
Shut up!

94
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:01,240
It's better to be childless
than have a worthless child.

95
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,213
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

96
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:07,413
Prakash, can you give me
account of the Rs.50000..

97
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:09,701
That were withdrawn
from the company's account?

98
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:12,941
Mr. Basant can answer
that better than me.

99
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:14,661
Mr. Basant.

100
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:17,117
He can't recollect
anything in spite..

101
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,056
Of straining
every bit of his brain.

102
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:21,877
Father, you
humiliate me before others..

103
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,256
As if I'm some ordinary employee.

104
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,267
I'm the general
manager of the company.

105
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:27,581
Not some clerk.

106
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,381
A clerk is much better than you.

107
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,501
He earns a living by working hard.

108
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,536
They don't blow up their father's..

109
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,941
Hard earned money like you do.

110
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:40,166
Prakash, now onwards,
you'll look after the accounts.

111
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,886
I appoint you the
in-charge of the company's account.

112
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:43,937
All right.

113
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:46,606
And from now on, he won't get
a penny without your approval.

114
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:48,166
You are blatantly insulting me.

115
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:50,241
I can never tolerate that.

116
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:52,460
Get out if you can't tolerate it.

117
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:57,361
You will be responsible if there
is any misappropriation of funds.

118
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:58,606
- Got it?
- Yes.

119
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:09,315
- Sorry.
- Pathetic rat!

120
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,879
I'm coming in a bit.

121
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:02,666
"Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!"

122
00:09:02,861 --> 00:09:07,012
"You're the wings, I'm the flight."

123
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:10,915
"You're the melody of my life."

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,959
"And I'm the voice of that melody."

125
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:19,319
"Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!"

126
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:23,443
"You're the wings, I'm the flight."

127
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:27,465
"You're the song of my life."

128
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,639
"I'm the style of that song."

129
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:36,119
"Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!"

130
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:58,536
"The eyes have coyly conveyed
the inhibitions in my heart."

131
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:06,879
"A love-struck person has heard
the other love-struck person."

132
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:11,096
"You're the culmination of love."

133
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:15,204
"And I'm the beginning of love."

134
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:19,239
"I'm the beginning of love."

135
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:23,496
"Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!"

136
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:27,713
"You're the wings, I'm the flight."

137
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:31,712
"You're the song of my life."

138
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,655
"I'm the style of that song."

139
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:40,135
"Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!"

140
00:10:54,621 --> 00:11:02,621
"Whether it's about
the sky or the earth."

141
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:10,735
"All the things now
start and end with you."

142
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:15,011
"You're beautiful. A damsel."

143
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:19,130
"You're the stylish one.
And I'm the style."

144
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:23,238
"You're the stylish one.
And I'm the style."

145
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:27,093
"Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!"

146
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:31,408
"You're the wings, I'm the flight."

147
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:35,373
"You're the melody of my life."

148
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:39,333
"And I'm the voice of that melody."

149
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:43,688
"Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!"

150
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:47,787
"You're the wings, I'm the flight."

151
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:51,688
"You're the melody of my life."

152
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:55,683
"And I'm the voice of that melody."

153
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:01,001
"Oh, companion! Oh, my companion!"

154
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:08,266
- So, you are back, darling?
- Yes, Mother. Give this to me.

155
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:11,154
Let it be. Your
hands might get scraped.

156
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:14,194
Since your father's maid
is here to do all this.

157
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:17,874
I curse that woman who died.

158
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:19,805
Neither would she have died
nor would I come into this house.

159
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:21,333
And nor would I have to
see this wretched face.

160
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:26,531
Darling, why are you after this
poor girl's life all the time?

161
00:12:26,616 --> 00:12:27,954
You just keep quiet.

162
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,464
You have pampered her rotten.

163
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,041
After all, why are
you after her life?

164
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,816
Gosh! I'm after her.

165
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:36,136
Have I gone crazy? Am I mad?

166
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:38,797
You always say hurtful things
to me defending your daughter.

167
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,256
It's better than I die.

168
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:41,856
Lord, please grant me death.

169
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,656
Death is better than this life.

170
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:46,056
Ganga, please keep
quiet for God's sake.

171
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:48,032
Harbouring ill feeling towards
her all the time is not right.

172
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:48,914
Put an end to this fight.

173
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:52,776
This fight will end only
when she gets married and I die.

174
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:53,976
Do you get that?

175
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:03,237
After your mother's death, there
wasn't anyone to look after you.

176
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:08,945
I swear on God. I got
married only for your sake.

177
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:13,336
I never knew that
your father's house..

178
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,366
Would become a hell-hole for you.

179
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,650
Father, don't be sad.

180
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:20,099
I have become used to these things.

181
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:26,551
Oh, my! Gosh! It's you.

182
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:28,295
Yes, darling.

183
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,526
Go away. You uncouth girl.

184
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,173
But where do I get the
style to love you from?

185
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:36,787
Fall in love with someone.
He'll teach you.

186
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:40,607
- I have tried that as well.
- What! Who is that guy?

187
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,069
There is a silly boy.

188
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:47,373
But he can't see beyond his work.

189
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,626
He is really a true soul.

190
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,846
Since he has the passion
to do something else..

191
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,190
In spite of all your advances.

192
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,670
Bring him to meet me some day.

193
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,310
How would someone who
doesn't have time for me meet you?

194
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:03,009
Do this. Just ignore
him for some days.

195
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,150
I bet you'll fall at your feet.

196
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:07,902
You are really experienced now.

197
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:12,129
Have you been smitten by someone?

198
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,744
- No.
- Look, don't try to hide it from me.

199
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:19,691
- Tell me. Who is it?
- No one.

200
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:22,999
Swear on me then.

201
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:25,511
I'm not shameless
like you. I feel shy.

202
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:28,631
Gosh! These tantrums.

203
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,375
But who is that birdie?

204
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:32,645
He is a human.

205
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,007
I never said you've
fallen for a donkey.

206
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:39,951
After all, who is he?
What does he do?

207
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:44,820
I don't know.
And nor do I want to find out.

208
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:47,134
What if someday the
prey loses his way?

209
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:48,896
Where would you look for him?

210
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,993
I have confidence in myself.

211
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,751
Undoubtedly.

212
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:01,510
The trap is new,
strong and first-class.

213
00:15:02,008 --> 00:15:04,191
Bring him here to meet me.

214
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:05,911
Have you introduced to your man?

215
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:07,511
I'll introduce him
to you today itself.

216
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,231
Today? Where?

217
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,471
In my new office.

218
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,351
We have to go to collect
charity for the women's society.

219
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:14,927
Bela and Neelu will
be joining us there.

220
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:16,031
You also come along.

221
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:18,007
You skipped the
meeting yesterday, isn't it?

222
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:19,671
That's why I have
come to inform you.

223
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:20,871
Okay. See you.

224
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,059
- Listen.
- What?

225
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,271
Go away.

226
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,591
- You!
- Poonam!

227
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,671
How come you are here?

228
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:41,238
This is my office. I work here.

229
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:42,351
Wonderful.

230
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:45,389
- My friend too works here.
- Your friend? Who?

231
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:46,287
Vandana Mehra.

232
00:15:46,372 --> 00:15:48,849
Vandana. Is she your friend?

233
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,536
Why are you so surprised?

234
00:15:50,621 --> 00:15:52,751
Nothing. You never told me.

235
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:54,391
I never got the chance to tell you.

236
00:15:54,476 --> 00:16:00,631
- Where is she?
- Come. Sit here.

237
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:03,391
This is her desk.
She'll be here any moment.

238
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:08,977
Poonam. When did you come?

239
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:10,062
Just now.

240
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:11,631
Look after your friend.

241
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:13,551
Poonam, excuse me.

242
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,978
How do you know him?

243
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,832
Just as you know your man.

244
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,766
What do you mean?

245
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:31,399
He is the one about
whom I had told you.

246
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,626
How is my choice? Tell me.

247
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,492
It's good. Very good.

248
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,712
Excellent.

249
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,474
And where is your prince charming?

250
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,031
Just call him.

251
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:48,609
There is no one.

252
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,085
I was just joking.

253
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,610
- That was a joke.
- Yes.

254
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,528
You have never ever
played such a serious joke.

255
00:16:56,729 --> 00:17:00,729
Never before has
such a situation arisen.

256
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:02,456
What situation?

257
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:06,979
Vandana had promised me that
when I come to office, she'll..

258
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:09,816
Poornima. Don't
say anything further.

259
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:11,141
For my sake.

260
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:12,656
Okay. Okay. I won't.

261
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:15,016
Bela and Neelu haven't come yet?

262
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:18,456
May I ask you why the
women army is gathering here?

263
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:21,056
To raid your prisons.

264
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,474
We are collecting
charity for the women society.

265
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,409
There is only one big fish here.

266
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:26,274
Mr. Basant.

267
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:28,339
- Come, I'll take you to him.
- Come.

268
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:31,778
No. You go. I'll
wait for Bela and Neelu.

269
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:33,021
- Okay.
- Come.

270
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:44,478
Ms. Poornima, I guess
I have seen you before.

271
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,718
No. This is the
first time we have met.

272
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,238
Okay. So be it.

273
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:49,758
It certainly won't be the last.

274
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,078
In what locality do you live?

275
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,038
The lanes are very narrow.

276
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:55,558
Your cars won't be
able to get there.

277
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:56,718
I'll come on foot.

278
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,934
There are many potholes.
You'll stumble and fall.

279
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,073
Don't worry.

280
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:02,286
I'll somehow stumble
my way to your house.

281
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:04,873
Mr. Basant, it would
better if we talk business.

282
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,078
Sure. Sure.

283
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:09,398
Here's my wallet. Take
as much as you want.

284
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:11,615
No. Give us how
much ever you want to.

285
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,198
No. Whatever you say.
Come on, tell me. Please.

286
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:19,248
- Rs.100 would be enough.
- That's it. Here are Rs.200.

287
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:22,838
Take it. Take it. Here.

288
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,639
Thank you. Let's go, Poonam.

289
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:34,038
- And no letters.
- Moron!

290
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:38,718
Basant will find
Poornima sooner or later.

291
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:47,909
"You're the song of my life."

292
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,152
- Hello.
- Hello.

293
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:54,746
Don't be so rude.

294
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:56,666
I'm here only to meet you.

295
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:57,801
What for?

296
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,106
Ask that to my heart.

297
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,413
It beats for you all the time.

298
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:05,651
Mr. Basant, I hate indecency.

299
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:07,386
I'm not being indecent at all.

300
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,170
I just want to
present my heart to you.

301
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,666
Keep it with you.

302
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:13,026
Look, don't refuse.

303
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:14,204
You won't regret it.

304
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,782
After all, what
can Prakash give you?

305
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:18,582
I can bring all the
happiness in the world to your feet.

306
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,799
I don't care about
such happiness. Go away.

307
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:22,466
Why would I come
here if I had to go?

308
00:19:22,546 --> 00:19:23,666
Then you can die here.

309
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:28,627
She gets angry at my love.

310
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:32,426
But I love her anger.

311
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:38,706
Poonam. Where are storming to?

312
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:41,499
What's the matter?

313
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,614
Go ask your boss's son.

314
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,179
He was saying indecent things to me.

315
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:47,492
So, the loafer has
reached here as well.

316
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,739
He is as big a loafer
as decent is his father.

317
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,113
Now onwards, let me know
if he says anything to you.

318
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:53,339
I'll fix him real good.

319
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:58,095
But Prakash, how long will
we keeping meeting like this?

320
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:01,457
Now, even mother wants me out of
the house as soon as possible.

321
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,772
She wants you out of the house.

322
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:04,678
And I want you in my house.

323
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:07,369
I'll send my brother-in-law to
your father tomorrow itself.

324
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:09,689
As to when do I come
with the wedding procession?

325
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:12,602
Listen, it will be so much fun.

326
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,045
I would be the groom.
You would be the bride.

327
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,311
Then we'll get married.

328
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:18,938
And I'll bring you to my
house from your house.

329
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:20,859
Then? What will happen then?

330
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:23,299
You are so cheap!

331
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:28,779
It's been so long.

332
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,520
But brother-in-law has still not
returned from Poornima's house.

333
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:33,219
Brother, you've
sent a lunatic there.

334
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:36,162
I'm afraid that instead of
getting the engagement fixed..

335
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,739
He might mess it all up.

336
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,792
Here he comes.

337
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:44,112
My dear brother-in-law.

338
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:45,632
Just give me the good news. I..

339
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:47,512
What's the matter, Brother-in-law?

340
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:49,112
Hold the umbrella, son.

341
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:52,358
Brother-in-law, you are coming
from Poornima's house, isn't it?

342
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:53,552
Hold this court as well.

343
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:54,912
But what happened?

344
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:59,592
- Look, I went directly to their house.
- Then?

345
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:01,112
I knocked on the door.

346
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,912
Then Mr. Motilal peeped
outside and opened the door.

347
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:06,528
Is it? Then what happened,
Brother-in-law?

348
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:08,488
What do you expect? I went
straight into the house.

349
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,232
I smiled at him.

350
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:11,992
He too smiled at me.

351
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:15,112
Like this. Only four teeth
were visible out of the 32.

352
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:18,152
But what happened next,
Brother-in-law?

353
00:21:18,232 --> 00:21:22,472
As you know, I told the
oldie that we like your daughter.

354
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:25,952
Then the oldie asked me,
"Brother, what is your name?"

355
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,478
And what do you do?

356
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:31,154
I retorted that I'm
Chimanbhai Suratwala.

357
00:21:31,352 --> 00:21:33,112
And my work is that
I'm a live-in son-in-law.

358
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:35,770
As soon as he heard this
the oldie got enraged.

359
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:38,657
And in that rage, he said,
"Get out, Chimanbhai Suratwala."

360
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:40,561
Otherwise, I will
disfigure your face.

361
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,764
That's it. My palms
started getting sweaty.

362
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,044
You see, Brother.

363
00:21:45,124 --> 00:21:47,029
Did you go there to fix
brother's marriage or your marriage?

364
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:48,053
My father's marriage.

365
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:49,484
Why are you butting in?

366
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:52,225
So, Brother-in-law, I quickly
told him that..

367
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,128
I'm not here for my marriage.

368
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,063
I'm here with my
brother-in-law's proposal.

369
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,409
- Then?
- The oldie was over the moon.

370
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:01,024
He said that your
brother-in-law is one in a million.

371
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:04,256
I'm ready to get my daughter
married to your brother-in-law.

372
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:05,272
My brother-in-law.

373
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,586
Hey! What are you doing?

374
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,615
Aren't you ashamed of doing
that in front of your sister?

375
00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:10,495
Brother-in-law.

376
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,154
Look, make the arrangement
for the wedding quickly.

377
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,602
Okay. I'll arrange the money.

378
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,287
And you make
arrangements for my wedding.

379
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:17,499
Quickly.

380
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:18,948
I will. I will.

381
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:20,764
"My beloved."

382
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,452
Brother will handle everything.

383
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:24,006
But we must also do something.

384
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:26,425
I'll do anything you ask me to do.

385
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,185
1000, 2000, 2500, 2750..

386
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,425
Stop. Stop. Stop..

387
00:22:30,632 --> 00:22:32,161
You don't even have a
single penny in your pocket.

388
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,561
And you're talking about thousands.

389
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,825
Come on. As the case is.

390
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:36,505
You take your dear ones for granted.

391
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:38,745
You don't know this
Indian Hindi Port.

392
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:40,545
I can multiply the money in a flash.

393
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:42,265
Multiply the money!

394
00:22:42,336 --> 00:22:43,336
This is nothing.

395
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:45,385
If you give me
Rs.500 today and don't..

396
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,200
Make Rs.25000 out
of it in five days..

397
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:50,727
Then call me your family
barber and not your husband.

398
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:52,185
- Really.
- I cross my heart.

399
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:54,385
- Out with 500 bucks.
- Not here. - Then where?

400
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:55,785
- Let's go to our room.
- Come on.

401
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:03,494
Sir, look carefully and
tell me what business..

402
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:05,737
Would be beneficial for me.

403
00:23:06,132 --> 00:23:07,132
Help me!

404
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:09,577
Oh, my! The lines are dangerous.

405
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:11,262
No planet is in its right position.

406
00:23:11,365 --> 00:23:12,857
Mars and Mercury are at loggerheads.

407
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:15,257
And Venus is under the cloud.

408
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:16,932
And the Saturn has
overwhelmed Jupiter.

409
00:23:17,017 --> 00:23:18,097
And Sunday..

410
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,808
And Sunday is nowhere in sight.

411
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:21,831
What nonsense, Sir.

412
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:26,057
All the days of the
week are Sundays to me.

413
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:27,913
And ever since I have
become the brother-in-law..

414
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:29,335
I've leading a leisurely life.

415
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,082
- But now, your peace will be ruined.
- Why?

416
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:35,637
If you don't offer money to a
Priest immediately, you'll be dead.

417
00:23:35,886 --> 00:23:37,929
You are done for, Chimanbhai.

418
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:40,642
Now, where do I bring a
priest from at such a short notice?

419
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:43,042
Idiot! Who is this
sitting before you?

420
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,259
I'm sorry, Brother.

421
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:46,285
I failed to
recognise you. Forgive me.

422
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,842
Now, if you give me the order, I will
give you 525 annas (monetary unit).

423
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:50,988
525 annas won't do.

424
00:23:51,073 --> 00:23:52,328
Then will 775 do?

425
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:56,523
- 775 won't do either. I need Re.1 to change the stars.
- Is it?

426
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:02,301
Here you go.

427
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:05,568
All the troubles have
been done away with.

428
00:24:05,604 --> 00:24:07,009
Now, you'll prosper.

429
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:12,338
Sir, just tell me when I
become India's Henry Ford.

430
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:16,360
Henry Ford? What the hell is that?

431
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,619
What are you thinking, sir?

432
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:23,776
You have to take great
pains to get to this position.

433
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,592
Only a select few sages
have got to that position.

434
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:31,570
Sages. What nonsense!

435
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,343
Henry Ford hailed from America.

436
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:36,738
He had built the Ford car,
truck and lorry.

437
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,224
So what? Be it America or Africa.

438
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:41,299
Henry Ford comes
into being anywhere.

439
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:44,776
Some built cars.
And some shave people.

440
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:49,056
- Do you know what India's Henry Ford did?
- No.

441
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:52,096
He had built a chariot for Ravan in
the battle of Mahabharat (Hindu epic).

442
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:53,256
Is it?

443
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:56,376
You're great. Sir, you're great.

444
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,936
I never came across a
more learned man than you.

445
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:03,376
Now, just tell me what
business will help me prosper.

446
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:05,176
- Out with Re.1.
- Hold on.

447
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:08,056
Here it is, sir.

448
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:11,906
The country will be under the cloud.

449
00:25:12,185 --> 00:25:14,574
Various types of
disease will spread.

450
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,856
Countless people will die.

451
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:18,131
Sell medicines.

452
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,396
No. No, sir. That
would be too expensive.

453
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:26,296
Suggest me a business that will
get me Rs.1000 if I invest Re.1.

454
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:29,309
Then go start wood
and garment business.

455
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,584
You will prosper.

456
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:33,438
A wood and garment business.

457
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:36,432
Sir, I can't seem to get it.

458
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:38,691
If you sit here,
you'll understand nothing.

459
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,032
- An intelligent donkey..
- I understood. I understood.

460
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,136
A sign in more than enough.

461
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:44,290
A wood and garment business.

462
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,160
A wood and garment business.

463
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:55,857
Brother, I'm ready to buy all
your funeral clothes by the lot.

464
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:57,295
So, is the entire family dead?

465
00:25:57,526 --> 00:25:59,289
No. The entire family is not dead.

466
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:00,164
Then what for?

467
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:01,805
Only for the sake of
a great man like you.

468
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:02,717
What did you say?

469
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:05,466
Brother, increasing the
population is in a human's hands.

470
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,852
But decreasing it is God's hands.

471
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:09,106
And is kind to me these days.

472
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:10,826
Hence, pack all the funeral clothes.

473
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:12,021
Hold on.

474
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:13,301
Pack them.

475
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:14,906
I've won the battle.

476
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:17,290
Henceforth I'll be known
as Chimanbhai Kafanwala.

477
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:18,626
Readymade funeral clothes.

478
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,946
I'll be where there is
death with the funeral clothes.

479
00:26:21,106 --> 00:26:24,626
Home delivery. Speedily at that.

480
00:26:26,946 --> 00:26:28,026
Oh, my!

481
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,626
What is all this?

482
00:26:29,866 --> 00:26:32,386
This is the balance of death.
Funeral clothes.

483
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:35,386
- For whom?
- Don't worry. It's not for you.

484
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:37,186
It's for business.
Come on in, Brothers.

485
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:38,773
Keep all the stuff in my bedroom.

486
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:40,833
Don't you dare bring it inside! Out.

487
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:42,312
You have wasted Rs.500.

488
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:46,126
I have wasted it! This
is pure gold. Pure gold.

489
00:26:46,211 --> 00:26:46,999
What nonsense!

490
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:48,253
Brother is getting married.

491
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:50,165
And you are concerned about
what's auspicious and what's not.

492
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:51,496
Quiet. You're talking
about Mangal (auspicious)..

493
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,552
On Budh (Wednesday).

494
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,127
Sir has said that the
situation is going to worsen.

495
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:58,806
Countless people will die.

496
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:00,917
And my funeral clothes
will sell like hot cakes.

497
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:02,084
You!

498
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:03,609
Take this away. Else I will burn it.

499
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:06,417
My, my. Why do you bother?

500
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,985
These clothes are meant to be burnt.

501
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,040
Are you going or not?

502
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:13,708
I'm. But let me tell you.
Choose one of your sizes.

503
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:14,936
You'll need it.

504
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:17,142
What? You'll make me
wear funeral clothes.

505
00:27:17,227 --> 00:27:18,932
I won't. God will make your wear it.

506
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:21,302
- Get out. - I'm going.
- Won't you let me go in?

507
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:24,078
- No.
- Then I'll go sell these funeral clothes in a flash.

508
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:24,839
Let's go, Brothers.

509
00:27:24,924 --> 00:27:26,984
In a flash. My foot!

510
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:34,301
So you are here. Don't
you think you are early?

511
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:36,169
You order me to
come at a fixed time..

512
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,717
But you are nowhere in sight.

513
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:39,422
Why are you mum?

514
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:42,177
Remove your hand.
Remove it. Come on.

515
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:44,302
So, you won't. I'll
teach you a lesson.

516
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:47,982
- You?
- Why do you have such long nails?

517
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,262
To scratch the faces
of loafers like you.

518
00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:52,974
Where are you off to?

519
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:55,102
Mr. Basant, I just
might forget my manners..

520
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:57,627
You might get a tight
slap on across your face.

521
00:27:57,712 --> 00:27:59,462
Who cares about the face?

522
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:02,300
You have made my life colourful.

523
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,457
If you don't believe me, then
listen to the beats of my heart.

524
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,982
Which beats for you all the time?

525
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:09,982
- Come on.
- You pathetic idiot!

526
00:28:10,382 --> 00:28:12,462
These fragile hands are
not mean for hitting someone.

527
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:13,838
But are meant to put
around someone's neck.

528
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:14,982
Leave me. Leave me.

529
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:15,962
Leave me, you idiot!

530
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:17,462
Leave me, you idiot!

531
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,490
Leave me! Leave me, you idiot.

532
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,158
Now, I'll leave you
only when I make you mine.

533
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:26,302
How dare you! You animal! You rat!

534
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:30,102
How dare you raise
your hand on our master..

535
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:31,711
In spite of being a servant!

536
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:33,854
Don't give me that
nonsense about being a servant.

537
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,182
To hell with you and your job.

538
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:39,268
I would've buried you
alive if not for your father.

539
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,102
Get out of here if
your life is dear to you.

540
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:43,382
Prakash! Prakash! Come on.

541
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,982
I shall be doomed if I
don't make them suffer.

542
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,033
Really.

543
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:59,222
What makes me happy is that
you agreed to get married.

544
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:00,702
Who is that girl?

545
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:03,822
Motilal's daughter Poornima.

546
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:07,541
Poornima. Oh. Ganga's step daughter.

547
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:08,697
I know her.

548
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:11,425
She is beautiful. I like her.

549
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,597
That's it. Now get this
alliance approved as soon as you can.

550
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,742
- Okay, son.
- My dear mother.

551
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:21,217
But Mother, I hope
father will agree to this.

552
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,713
Don't worry about him.

553
00:29:22,938 --> 00:29:24,312
Consider that this marriage is on.

554
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:27,512
Whom are you getting married?

555
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:32,641
- Basant.
- Only humans get married. And not animals.

556
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:33,826
Mother, like I had told you.

557
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:34,760
Look, don't..

558
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:37,605
Don't dream of ruining
some poor girl's life.

559
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:42,195
This moron is not worthy of
getting married to any decent girl.

560
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,720
You say whatever comes to your mind.

561
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,400
After all, what's wrong with my son?

562
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:47,800
You have been blinded
by your love for him.

563
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:50,040
That's you can't see his deeds.

564
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,212
How do I explain to you?

565
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:58,534
He is ruining our wealth,
reputation and business.

566
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:00,731
This is not true, Mother.

567
00:30:01,137 --> 00:30:02,374
Shut up!

568
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:05,101
What did he splurge
Rs.50000 on, the last month?

569
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:07,208
- Ask him.
- 50000.

570
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:11,861
Mother, I had donated it
as charity to orphanage..

571
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:13,938
Women care centre and cowshed.

572
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:15,249
Heard that?

573
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:17,164
Now, tell me.
What wrong has he done?

574
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,205
You have gotten
used to jibing at him.

575
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:23,486
You won't believe me till you
see his misdeeds for yourself.

576
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Come with me.

577
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:41,190
Here's the cowshed.
Here's the orphanage.

578
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,906
And here's the widow care centre.

579
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:45,526
Basant, what is this? Speak up.

580
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:46,424
What is this?

581
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:47,946
Mother, these liquor
bottles aren't mine.

582
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,050
Then are they mine?

583
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:51,379
No, these belong to the drunkards..

584
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:54,128
Whom we have
convinced to quit drinking.

585
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,881
He is an absolute rogue,
loafer and a liar.

586
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:58,888
He will never get married.

587
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:00,088
This is my final decision.

588
00:31:00,112 --> 00:31:01,140
Got it?

589
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:04,827
Father, you'll have to
change your decision.

590
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:05,912
What?

591
00:31:10,017 --> 00:31:11,704
Otherwise, there will be bloodshed.

592
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:13,909
Basant, don't you dare
raise your hand on your father.

593
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:16,511
Mother, I don't want to kill father.
I want to kill myself.

594
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:17,661
No, Basant. No.

595
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:19,883
What's the point in leading a life..

596
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:21,430
Wherein a father has
no respect for his son?

597
00:31:21,454 --> 00:31:22,938
Leave me. Leave me.

598
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,297
- No, Basant.
- Leave me, Mother.

599
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,365
Please say yes. Say
yes for God's sake.

600
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,857
Mother, don't force father.

601
00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:29,143
Let me die.

602
00:31:29,228 --> 00:31:31,878
No, No. I beg of you.

603
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:33,448
Are you his father or his enemy?

604
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:36,387
Please say yes. Say
yes for God's sake.

605
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:37,793
I beg of you.

606
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:40,768
Do whatever you want.
To hell with you people.

607
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,648
Mother, you are a darling.
You are a darling.

608
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,888
Mother, I must get
married to Poornima.

609
00:31:51,394 --> 00:31:52,528
Yes, son.

610
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:56,008
But I have heard that
she is already engaged.

611
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:58,888
She is already engaged.

612
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,448
Sister, well whatever
you are saying is right.

613
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:05,008
But the arrow has
already left the bow.

614
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:08,075
Her father has fixed her
marriage a few days ago.

615
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:10,248
Marriages are fixed
and then called off.

616
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:13,408
If has fixed it, then
you get it called off.

617
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:15,923
This is very difficult, Sister.

618
00:32:16,008 --> 00:32:18,408
It is difficult, but
it is not impossible.

619
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:22,248
I have heard that Lala
dances to your tune.

620
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:24,408
You have heard right.

621
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:27,008
But what do I say, Sister?

622
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:28,888
Sometimes when he acts stubborn..

623
00:32:28,968 --> 00:32:31,091
It becomes a little
difficult to make him budge.

624
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:34,571
According to me, wash your
hands off this proposal.

625
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:37,090
Anyway, as you wish.

626
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:40,085
My son's insistence
had dragged me to you.

627
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,745
I thought his wish will come true..

628
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:46,854
And you too will gain
something along the way.

629
00:32:50,422 --> 00:32:53,265
But I guess only this
wallet is in his destiny.

630
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:55,498
Okay. See you later.

631
00:32:56,338 --> 00:32:57,418
What's the big hurry?

632
00:32:57,498 --> 00:32:59,338
Sit, Sister. Please sit.

633
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:01,218
What's the point in waiting here?

634
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:06,498
The thing is I do not like
turning you down like this.

635
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:08,029
Then what are you waiting for?

636
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:09,347
Say yes.

637
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:11,378
I've come here to give you money.

638
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:14,258
Only in return of a daughter-in-law.

639
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:17,510
Sister, to be honest,
anyone who sees..

640
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,858
Poornima is left dumbstruck.

641
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:21,509
As it is, I never lie.

642
00:33:21,594 --> 00:33:24,978
I have already turned down
around 12 marriage proposals.

643
00:33:25,178 --> 00:33:30,547
I agreed only when the boy's
family agreed to give us Rs.12000.

644
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:32,341
Then take 13000 from me.

645
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:37,378
13! But the
difference is of just 1000.

646
00:33:37,942 --> 00:33:40,850
It's seems a little dicey to
invite so much of trouble..

647
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:44,763
And curses from the other
party for such a meagre amount.

648
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:46,374
Then let's settle it at Rs.14000.

649
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:50,613
14000. No, Sister.
Let's settle it on 15.

650
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:52,684
We have a deal if you
are willing to pay 15.

651
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,352
So, be it.

652
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:56,893
But I hope Lala will agree.

653
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:59,688
Forget him. I have the keys to him.

654
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:01,333
I can manipulate him anyway I want.

655
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:03,013
My name is Ganga.

656
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:05,133
I annihilate anyone
who goes against me.

657
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:06,612
Now, we are talking.

658
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,277
Here are Rs.13000.

659
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,453
And 2000 post the wedding.

660
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:14,408
But Sister, I should get it
before the nuptial rounds.

661
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:15,772
Don't worry about them.

662
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:17,584
The job should be done.

663
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,893
Don't worry about that.

664
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:20,457
Okay, I'll take your leave now.

665
00:34:25,574 --> 00:34:26,692
- Bye.
- Bye.

666
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:30,213
I shall see how you don't return it.

667
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,394
- Come with me.
- No.

668
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,640
I said come with me.

669
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,856
- No, I won't come.
- Leave me.

670
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,073
- I said leave me.
- You will have to return the money.

671
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,360
Leave me.

672
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:41,520
Father!

673
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,991
- Oh, my God!
- Father!

674
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:49,400
Father! Father!

675
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:25,656
Come.

676
00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:33,278
- Doctor.
- Don't worry. Have courage.

677
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:35,296
My heart is sinking.

678
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:36,647
Neither does the bleeding stop..

679
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:37,760
Nor does he regain consciousness.

680
00:35:37,784 --> 00:35:39,336
That's why I too am worried.

681
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:42,272
I think some internal vein has burst

682
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:45,096
We will have to take him
to a clinic immediately.

683
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:48,176
Delay would be fatal.

684
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:50,216
I'll call up the specialist.

685
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:51,629
He must be
operated upon immediately.

686
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:52,435
Operation.

687
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,859
It's a major operation.

688
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,937
At least Rs.10000 would be needed.

689
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:57,261
Rs.10000.

690
00:35:58,045 --> 00:36:00,100
I'll call up the ambulance.

691
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:10,192
What did the doctor say?

692
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:12,272
He'll have to be operated upon.

693
00:36:12,352 --> 00:36:13,992
- Operation.
- Yes.

694
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,312
How much money do we
have at our disposal?

695
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:18,352
Around 70 or 80.

696
00:36:18,672 --> 00:36:20,512
- Just 70 or 80.
- Yes.

697
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:28,232
My daughter won't be sold off.

698
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:31,351
She won't be sold off.

699
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:37,395
Return it. Return the money.

700
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:39,752
Return the money.

701
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:42,358
Return every single penny.

702
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:46,747
I'll return it right away.
Right away.

703
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:53,515
- Very well.
- Look. Look. I'll go return it right away.

704
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,374
I'll go return it right away.

705
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:59,396
Mother, this money
won't be returned.

706
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,754
- Give it to me.
- But Poornima..

707
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,943
Give it to me.

708
00:37:03,462 --> 00:37:04,858
What are you saying? Think of..

709
00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:06,965
I don't want to
think about anything.

710
00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:09,408
I accept all their conditions.

711
00:37:10,392 --> 00:37:16,122
I will marry him. I will marry.
I will marry him.

712
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:24,219
Hello.

713
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:28,659
The wedding was quite an affair.

714
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:34,869
The only thing it
lacked was Prakash.

715
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:39,312
Poor chap. He didn't come
to even congratulate us.

716
00:37:40,264 --> 00:37:42,967
His absence from the
wedding must have shocked you.

717
00:37:43,453 --> 00:37:46,653
And you must be feeling like
crying because of his disloyalty.

718
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:49,219
I have forgotten everything.

719
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:52,330
This is not right.

720
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:58,200
Just recollect those moments
when you and him were together.

721
00:37:58,395 --> 00:37:59,939
The old Poornima is dead.

722
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:04,219
Now, I don't remember anything.
Apart from you.

723
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:08,082
Your memory is very weak.

724
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:11,952
When Prakash hears this,
he will be grief-stricken.

725
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:13,660
Let him be.

726
00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:20,449
I've burnt all the relationship
in the sacred wedding fire.

727
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,065
Now, you're my God.

728
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,855
You don't need to be so formal.

729
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:32,904
Well, if mentioning the name hurts
you, then I won't utter it again.

730
00:38:33,996 --> 00:38:35,239
I hope you are happy now.

731
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,955
Then give me a smile.

732
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:39,915
Come on, smile.

733
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:45,315
Look, I have got such a
beautiful gift for you.

734
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:53,704
Why? Did you like it?

735
00:38:57,358 --> 00:38:58,742
Very good! Amazing!

736
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:01,498
You've separated the
heartbeat from the heart so expertly.

737
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:07,770
But remember, if I ever
see both of you together..

738
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:10,115
I'll ruin your lives.

739
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,920
That day will never arrive.
It will never arrive.

740
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:17,555
I beg at your feet.
Please forget my past.

741
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:21,195
Now, you are
everything to me. Everything.

742
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,715
Okay, I trust you.

743
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:59,313
"May the light of
happiness brighten up your life.."

744
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:06,448
"The darkness suits me today."

745
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:14,046
"I was estranged from
myself after meeting you."

746
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:21,366
"I've come closer on leaving you."

747
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:28,858
"May the light of
happiness brighten up your life."

748
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:37,009
"The darkness suits me today."

749
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:05,291
"I don't complain
about your disloyalty."

750
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:12,525
"I'm crazy, I don't regret."

751
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:19,973
"I don't complain
about your disloyalty."

752
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:27,109
"I'm crazy, I don't regret."

753
00:41:27,412 --> 00:41:34,493
"My steps have brought me this far."

754
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:42,590
"The darkness suits me today."

755
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:10,811
"I'm leaving the garden
with this allegation."

756
00:42:11,034 --> 00:42:17,966
"I've passed many
days in your name."

757
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:25,099
"I'm leaving the garden
with this allegation."

758
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:32,211
"I've passed many
days in your name."

759
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:39,553
"I've reached far from the
destination of desires."

760
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:46,755
"The darkness suits me today."

761
00:42:47,035 --> 00:42:54,138
"May the light of
happiness brighten up your life."

762
00:42:54,223 --> 00:43:00,971
"The darkness suits me today."

763
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:08,267
"I was estranged from
myself after meeting you."

764
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:16,321
"I've come closer on leaving you."

765
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,852
So, you have made a sacrifice
for your father and earned a merit.

766
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:24,960
But remember, Poornima, you
have committed a grave sin..

767
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:26,658
Along with earning a merit.

768
00:43:26,743 --> 00:43:28,810
Vandana, stop it for God's sake.

769
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:30,961
Don't make fun of my helplessness.

770
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,075
I can't hear anything now.
I can't hear anything.

771
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:37,676
You can't hear and I
can't bear to see his sorrow.

772
00:43:37,924 --> 00:43:40,087
It's better that God gives me death.

773
00:43:41,524 --> 00:43:44,626
If I won't be alive,
I won't see him in such pain.

774
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:50,615
Vandana?

775
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:07,732
I want to talk to
you about something.

776
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:11,332
What is left to talk now?

777
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:15,373
Mr. Prakash, I've very less time.

778
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:16,917
I don't have any time too.

779
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,077
I didn't urge you
to prick my wounds.

780
00:44:20,597 --> 00:44:23,677
Nor did I call you here to see
the scene of my burning desires.

781
00:44:23,757 --> 00:44:25,144
I've not come here
to prick your wounds.

782
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:26,597
Then why have you come here?

783
00:44:27,018 --> 00:44:29,786
Which other sorrow do
you still want to give me?

784
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:32,305
I've come to break that
dream which you are lost in.

785
00:44:33,191 --> 00:44:38,554
I've come to bury those
memories which you still remember.

786
00:44:38,965 --> 00:44:41,712
What else do I have
except those memories now?

787
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,841
You want to snatch them too from me?

788
00:44:43,926 --> 00:44:46,868
Mr. Prakash, now you don't
have any right to say this.

789
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:48,889
- It is a sin.
- A sin?

790
00:44:49,408 --> 00:44:51,840
Of course it is a sin to
think about someone else's wife.

791
00:44:52,478 --> 00:44:56,554
I don't want anyone else to
utter my name except my husband.

792
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,759
All right. Now, I will
never utter your name.

793
00:45:01,646 --> 00:45:04,933
And if I'm unable to
forget those memories..

794
00:45:05,127 --> 00:45:06,890
I'll kill myself.

795
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:09,754
Do you want to die
and mar a stigma on me?

796
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,570
You want me to think for lifetime..

797
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,922
That a stranger
gave up his life for me?

798
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:19,450
No, no. God is the witness,
I don't want to defame you.

799
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:21,851
I don't want to bring infamy to you.

800
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:27,073
If you don't want to
defame me, then listen to me.

801
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:28,976
Please marry Vandana.

802
00:45:29,061 --> 00:45:32,813
Marry? And me?

803
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:37,570
A dead body is covered
with a flower sheet..

804
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,721
And not adorned
with a flower veil.

805
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:45,634
Mr. Prakash, the time is the
best healer forever sorrow..

806
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:48,283
And caravan of life goes ahead.

807
00:45:48,672 --> 00:45:52,911
Life doesn't teach to
turn back but to go ahead.

808
00:45:54,143 --> 00:45:56,770
I'm saying this for your well-being.

809
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,203
If you are so
concerned about my well-being..

810
00:45:59,494 --> 00:46:06,090
Tell me what was my fault that
you gave me such a big punishment?

811
00:46:07,463 --> 00:46:10,014
Our destiny has
given us this punishment.

812
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,722
That money which my
mother-in-law gave to my mother..

813
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:20,953
They were the deadline
between my love and father's life.

814
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:26,077
My happiness was not
greater than my father's life.

815
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:31,785
Mr. Prakash, I can take
birth thousand times..

816
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:33,743
And sacrifice myself for him.

817
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:43,516
I don't have any
complaints from you now.

818
00:46:45,332 --> 00:46:47,083
Then you give your
consent for marriage.

819
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:51,688
But.. but I can't give
any happiness to anyone.

820
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:54,759
She will never be unhappy with you.

821
00:46:57,116 --> 00:47:02,068
No, no. I don't want to make
any girl's life miserable.

822
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:06,457
She will be the
happiest in your company.

823
00:47:06,846 --> 00:47:09,516
Please say yes. Mr.
Prakash, please say yes.

824
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:12,468
I don't understand anything.
What should I do?

825
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:13,982
What should I do?

826
00:47:16,512 --> 00:47:18,752
Won't you fulfil my last desire?

827
00:47:20,192 --> 00:47:21,539
Tell me, Mr. Prakash.

828
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:27,074
All right. As you wish.

829
00:47:47,972 --> 00:47:53,020
Milk. No. Not like this.
In this way.

830
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:54,793
Here. Drink it.

831
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:05,073
Vandana, you are so good.
You care a lot for me.

832
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:11,505
But I think as if I am
your culprit. My past..

833
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,311
I don't want to hear anything.

834
00:48:18,337 --> 00:48:21,030
A devotee is only
concerned with worship.

835
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:25,441
She doesn't need to find
out her God's feelings.

836
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:30,316
You are mine. You are with me.

837
00:48:30,986 --> 00:48:32,532
It is enough for me.

838
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:34,078
Vandana.

839
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,295
Leave it. Leave it.

840
00:48:42,327 --> 00:48:45,290
I tell you. I will never
leave my brother's house.

841
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,570
- Remove my clothes.
- Listen to me first.

842
00:48:48,013 --> 00:48:49,548
Then why did you marry me?

843
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,970
Look, Meena, my
brother-in-law's home is settled.

844
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:55,055
Now, you worry about
settling our house.

845
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:58,375
I've found a first-class
house with three windows for you.

846
00:48:58,553 --> 00:49:01,295
I will never thrive on earnings
of shrouds by staying with you.

847
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:02,631
Instead of being honest,
it's better that one..

848
00:49:02,655 --> 00:49:04,295
Depends on the earning of shrouds.

849
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:05,488
Then go and become one.

850
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,375
Look, a husband is like God.

851
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,449
And you want to get
separated from your husband?

852
00:49:09,698 --> 00:49:11,055
Come on, get ready quickly.

853
00:49:11,135 --> 00:49:13,375
I've said, I will
never come with you.

854
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:16,575
If you don't want to
walk along with me..

855
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:18,575
Then walk a
little ahead or behind.

856
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,465
- I will walk in middle.
- No.

857
00:49:20,815 --> 00:49:22,975
- Then I will go alone.
- Go.

858
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:24,400
I will really go.

859
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:28,606
This is your sari. This is
your stole and your skirt.

860
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,295
I don't need the mattress. Throw it.

861
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:33,666
- So, you are going?
- Yes.

862
00:49:33,895 --> 00:49:36,375
You may definitely go.
But do write letters to me.

863
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:38,539
- I won't write any letter.
- Then send a telegram.

864
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:40,135
I don't have so much money.

865
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:42,583
But do send me a money order
as soon you start earning.

866
00:49:42,607 --> 00:49:43,815
I will repay the loan.

867
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:46,455
Don't repay the loan but
perform my father's funeral rites.

868
00:49:46,535 --> 00:49:48,711
It's better to be a widower
instead of having such a wife.

869
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,173
I'm going. Goodbye.

870
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,575
I just request that
remember your husband..

871
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,975
When you are fed up
of your brother's house.

872
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,375
Perhaps.

873
00:49:57,221 --> 00:50:00,377
Why perhaps?
It's better that you stay here.

874
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:03,735
Oh, God, protect my sister-in-law.
Give us good news.

875
00:50:04,928 --> 00:50:07,575
Nurse. Tell me, Nurse.

876
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,111
Congratulations. A baby boy is born.

877
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:10,951
- Thank you very much.
- Congratulations, Brother.

878
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:12,215
Same to you for your nephew.

879
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:14,145
But this joy is
incomplete without brother-in-law.

880
00:50:14,169 --> 00:50:15,046
I'll bring him right now.

881
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:17,533
No, Brother. You can't
bring him on the right track.

882
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,769
I've it's solution. I know.

883
00:50:19,854 --> 00:50:22,190
Watch it. He will come
running ahead of me today.

884
00:50:22,275 --> 00:50:23,735
All right, then go soon.

885
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:28,656
It means he will take me
to the sky from the earth?

886
00:50:28,741 --> 00:50:30,622
Yes. Don't listen to him.

887
00:50:30,968 --> 00:50:32,382
Yesterday, he had
administered the same injection..

888
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:33,726
To washer-man Kalua's donkey.

889
00:50:34,038 --> 00:50:38,124
In the morning Kalua
found the donkey smiling.

890
00:50:39,096 --> 00:50:40,886
- He was smiling like this?
- Yes.

891
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:44,126
- I don't want to die. You will become a widow.
- Right.

892
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:47,326
Don't worry. I won't
become a widow so soon.

893
00:50:47,486 --> 00:50:49,326
Look, give him such a treatment..

894
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:51,226
That his disease
gets cured completely.

895
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:55,966
Idea! I think I should operate
upon him and clean his stomach.

896
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,934
- Operation?
- Yes, my dear.

897
00:50:59,019 --> 00:51:00,663
All right. First,
operate him and then..

898
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:02,500
Apply Bamboo Shah's kohl in eyes.

899
00:51:02,585 --> 00:51:05,127
No, I won't undergo an operation..

900
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:07,462
And apply Bamboo
Shah's kohl in my eyes.

901
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:09,288
Don't panic. Be brave.

902
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:11,602
He performs the operation in a snap.

903
00:51:11,796 --> 00:51:13,245
He will slit your
stomach in a snap..

904
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,645
And sew it back after
cleaning it in a snap.

905
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,801
Forget it. I'll lose
my life in a snap too.

906
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:20,224
I won't let you
operate upon my tummy.

907
00:51:20,248 --> 00:51:21,341
- Coward.
- I am.

908
00:51:21,426 --> 00:51:23,467
The stomach ailment is the
root cause of all the diseases.

909
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:24,703
Come on, Doctor, hurry up.

910
00:51:24,788 --> 00:51:26,288
- But why are you forcing me?
- Slit it.

911
00:51:26,312 --> 00:51:28,313
- Leave me.
- Doctor, hurry up.

912
00:51:34,054 --> 00:51:35,578
Wretched cruel butcher!

913
00:51:35,913 --> 00:51:39,243
Meena, I swear by you, I'm not sick.

914
00:51:39,328 --> 00:51:40,888
- I was pretending.
- He was pretending.

915
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:42,850
An excuse? You get the
disease of giving excuses..

916
00:51:42,874 --> 00:51:45,027
Also because of an upset stomach.

917
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:47,362
I'll have to
operate you at any cost.

918
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:51,005
No, no. Meena! Meena, I beg
at your feet. Please save me.

919
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,329
On one condition. Only if
you return home with me.

920
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:54,799
Yes, I will come.

921
00:51:55,332 --> 00:51:57,332
- Will you become a live-in son-in-law?
- I will.

922
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,382
- Will you do any wrong business?
- I will.

923
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:02,252
- What?
- No. I won't. Never.

924
00:52:02,492 --> 00:52:06,412
- Will you press my hands and feet if I've pain?
- I will.

925
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,220
Very good. You both have
given a fantastic performance.

926
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:11,760
- What?
- We are not real but duplicates.

927
00:52:11,845 --> 00:52:12,938
You cheated me?

928
00:52:13,023 --> 00:52:15,000
- It won't take long for a real doctor to arrive.
- No, no.

929
00:52:15,024 --> 00:52:16,070
Pay them Rs.20 immediately.

930
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:18,539
- But where will I give them Rs.20 from?
- From your pocket.

931
00:52:18,624 --> 00:52:21,848
I don't have a penny.
But I've two pieces of shrouds.

932
00:52:22,075 --> 00:52:24,680
You both take it. You will
need them after you die.

933
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:25,934
- What?
- Mother!

934
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:27,772
- Mother?
- No, dear.

935
00:52:27,857 --> 00:52:30,492
- Not Maya but Meena.
- Yes, Meena.

936
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,209
Congratulations.
Your grandson is born.

937
00:52:33,294 --> 00:52:34,692
- Really?
- Yes.

938
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,852
- Is our daughter-in-law fine?
- Yes.

939
00:52:39,037 --> 00:52:40,842
God has given us
such a big happiness..

940
00:52:41,502 --> 00:52:43,761
But I wonder where
that wretched boy is.

941
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:59,545
- Hello.
- Oh, Vandana. Come. Have a seat, dear.

942
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:04,399
- How are you?
- I'm fine, Uncle.

943
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:08,010
- How is Prakash?
- He is fine.

944
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:11,330
- How is his business going on?
- It's fine by God's grace.

945
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,243
I'm happy.
I'm really glad to know it.

946
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:17,006
Vandana, you? How did
you remember to come here?

947
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:19,091
First, call
brother-in-law then I'll tell you.

948
00:53:19,893 --> 00:53:21,171
He has gone to Nainital.

949
00:53:21,989 --> 00:53:24,184
Nainital? And alone?

950
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,087
Don't talk about that
worthless guy, dear.

951
00:53:26,919 --> 00:53:28,897
The world has changed, but not him.

952
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,541
Forget it. Tell me the
purpose of your visit.

953
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,819
Like every year we are
organising a charity show..

954
00:53:34,843 --> 00:53:36,627
For the women's
society this year too.

955
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:37,611
Do you want a donation?

956
00:53:37,696 --> 00:53:40,314
I want donation and
permission for Poonam too.

957
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:44,033
- No, Vandana. I can't participate.
- Why not?

958
00:53:44,746 --> 00:53:46,638
The show's success is
impossible without you.

959
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,476
But Vandana, I don't have any time.

960
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,460
Do you have to plough the
field that you don't have any time?

961
00:53:52,052 --> 00:53:54,050
Look, Prakash is so
busy but still he has..

962
00:53:54,561 --> 00:53:56,731
Shouldered the
entire responsibility.

963
00:53:57,259 --> 00:53:59,317
The show won't stop if
I don't participate.

964
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:01,022
You are needlessly being stubborn.

965
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:02,835
In fact you are stubborn,
Daughter-in-law.

966
00:54:03,071 --> 00:54:04,506
Prakash and Vandana
are organising the show..

967
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,614
So you must definitely go.

968
00:54:05,638 --> 00:54:07,671
But, Father, I.. How can't I?

969
00:54:07,756 --> 00:54:10,803
I understand, dear. You are
thinking about Basant, right?

970
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:13,250
He won't say anything as
I'm giving you permission.

971
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,421
Vandana, be assured.

972
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:18,286
My daughter-in-law will
definitely participate in the show.

973
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:33,107
"It's the full moon, the
night is showering love."

974
00:54:39,587 --> 00:54:47,587
"Lord Krishna is
standing with the flute today."

975
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:38,093
"Radha, your Krishna
is playing the flute."

976
00:55:38,178 --> 00:55:41,947
"Radha, your Krishna
is playing the flute."

977
00:55:42,032 --> 00:55:46,027
"Friend, why are you upset?
Why are you upset?"

978
00:55:46,112 --> 00:55:50,187
"Friend, why are you upset?
Why are you upset?"

979
00:55:50,272 --> 00:55:54,267
"Because of who you
couldn't sleep yesterday."

980
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:58,267
"Because of who you
couldn't sleep yesterday."

981
00:55:58,352 --> 00:56:02,427
"Friend, why are you upset?
Why are you upset?"

982
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:06,950
"Friend, why are you upset?
Why are you upset?"

983
00:56:27,347 --> 00:56:35,187
"Friend, I agree that
shepherd of Gokul is mischievous."

984
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:39,495
"Shepherd of Gokul."

985
00:56:39,876 --> 00:56:47,507
"Then why have you
applied the kohl of his love?"

986
00:56:47,955 --> 00:56:51,155
"Why did you apply the kohl?"

987
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:55,582
"Forget this excuse. Why
are you hiding it from us?"

988
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:59,747
"You are lying. You are lying."

989
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:03,973
"Friend, why are you upset?
Why are you upset?"

990
00:57:05,729 --> 00:57:09,992
"He impressed me but not his flute."

991
00:57:30,898 --> 00:57:38,665
"This flute is the
enemy of your love."

992
00:57:39,037 --> 00:57:42,314
"This flute is the enemy."

993
00:57:43,184 --> 00:57:50,827
"Give up this flute,
it is Radha's rival."

994
00:57:51,189 --> 00:57:54,507
"It is Radha's rival."

995
00:57:54,675 --> 00:57:58,814
"Get rid of this dilemma soon."

996
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:02,827
"Otherwise your love affair
will break. It will break."

997
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:07,107
"Friend, why are you upset?
Why are you upset?"

998
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:11,187
"Krishna, what fight
do you have with Radha?"

999
00:58:11,272 --> 00:58:15,120
"Please go and ask her that."

1000
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:19,349
"Friend, why are you upset?
Why are you upset?"

1001
00:58:31,871 --> 00:58:39,871
"You walk so swiftly, the
deer gets misguided too."

1002
00:58:41,098 --> 00:58:49,098
"The moon hides on
watching your fair face."

1003
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:51,960
"The flowers shed when you talk."

1004
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:54,099
"The colours become
vibrant when you smile."

1005
00:58:54,179 --> 00:58:56,259
"The flowers shed when you talk."

1006
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:58,827
"The colours become
vibrant when you smile."

1007
00:58:58,912 --> 00:59:05,539
"Your killing looks impress me."

1008
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,930
Where have everyone gone?

1009
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,301
Master and madam have
gone to attend a wedding..

1010
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:32,972
And daughter-in-law has gone to
attend the women society's function.

1011
00:59:32,996 --> 00:59:35,141
To attend the women
society's function? With who?

1012
00:59:35,221 --> 00:59:37,461
With sister Vandana and Mr. Prakash.

1013
00:59:37,771 --> 00:59:38,771
With Prakash?

1014
00:59:45,963 --> 00:59:46,963
Come in.

1015
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,608
Oh, sorry. Is Vandana here?

1016
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:53,505
No. She has gone to meet the
secretary of women's society.

1017
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:57,102
She must be coming.
Please be seated.

1018
01:00:00,311 --> 01:00:03,252
I don't understand how to thank you.

1019
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:06,253
The programme was a big
success because of you.

1020
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:10,189
I was very worried. What would
have happened if you didn't come?

1021
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,394
It would have been real bad.

1022
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,280
How you both could
have got a chance to meet?

1023
01:00:13,316 --> 01:00:15,556
- Mr. Basant!
- Shut up! Come with me.

1024
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:19,909
- Come with me!
- Leave my hand. I'm coming.

1025
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:23,204
Shut up! Did you think
that I will never return?

1026
01:00:23,289 --> 01:00:25,316
Either you or I will survive today.

1027
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:31,196
- Sister Vandana, where you had been?
- What happened?

1028
01:00:31,281 --> 01:00:32,865
Mr. Basant was very angry.

1029
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:35,476
He has forcefully dragged Poornima.

1030
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,722
- Mr. Basant?
- Yes.

1031
01:00:43,104 --> 01:00:45,534
So, you found an excuse to
meet him as soon I left?

1032
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:47,592
It is a lie. Father had sent me.

1033
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,997
Stop your nonsense!
Flirt and loose character lady!

1034
01:00:50,082 --> 01:00:51,407
- Basant!
- Shut up!

1035
01:00:52,445 --> 01:00:55,135
Now, tell me. Will you perform at
the show? Will you ever perform?

1036
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:58,483
Shame on you! What a
brave man you are!

1037
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:00,923
If you want to test your
ability then fight with some man..

1038
01:01:01,155 --> 01:01:03,144
Who can answer your
thrashings of stick with a rod.

1039
01:01:03,168 --> 01:01:05,003
Mind your tongue. Otherwise..

1040
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,163
Otherwise what will you do?

1041
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:09,243
Vandana, why are
you taking the blame?

1042
01:01:09,525 --> 01:01:12,003
I'm destined to
lead a miserable life.

1043
01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:14,163
This world is not so good, Poonam.

1044
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:16,403
The more you will endure,
you will be suppressed.

1045
01:01:16,767 --> 01:01:18,476
You should give a
solid reply in return.

1046
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:20,483
Will you go or shall I push you out?

1047
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:24,403
Try to touch me. Don't call me
Vandana if I don't smash your face.

1048
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:25,563
What did you say?

1049
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:29,390
Listen. Vandana, please go
away from here for God's sake.

1050
01:01:29,475 --> 01:01:32,149
No. I'm responsible
for taking you there..

1051
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:34,403
And now, I will free
you from his atrocities.

1052
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:37,157
I'll go and bring
the police right now.

1053
01:01:37,242 --> 01:01:38,403
Vandana! Vandana..

1054
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:39,563
Stop!

1055
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:42,944
She will never be able to
reach the police station.

1056
01:01:43,114 --> 01:01:44,567
I'll kill her before that.

1057
01:01:49,808 --> 01:01:52,645
No, no. I won't let you go.
Kill me if you want.

1058
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,205
Shut up! We don't have
any relation from today.

1059
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:56,511
- Get aside.
- No.

1060
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:06,377
Stop! Or I'll kill you right now.

1061
01:02:07,804 --> 01:02:08,937
Basant!

1062
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,215
Vandana.

1063
01:02:12,743 --> 01:02:15,675
- Mr. Prakash, let's go soon.
- What's wrong? - Come on, hurry up.

1064
01:02:22,854 --> 01:02:24,934
- I say stop the car.
- No.

1065
01:02:25,604 --> 01:02:28,454
Stop the car or I'll kill you.

1066
01:02:28,534 --> 01:02:31,009
You will also die if you'll kill me.

1067
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:33,094
Wretched lady, I'll see
how you won't stop the car.

1068
01:02:33,135 --> 01:02:34,614
- Leave me.
- Stop the car.

1069
01:02:37,072 --> 01:02:39,658
- Move aside.
- Stop the car.

1070
01:02:39,743 --> 01:02:40,921
Shove off.

1071
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:49,614
Vandana, stop!

1072
01:02:50,045 --> 01:02:52,804
- I say stop the car.
- No. Leave me.

1073
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,648
Vandana, stop there is danger ahead.

1074
01:03:16,604 --> 01:03:18,196
No!

1075
01:03:18,281 --> 01:03:21,318
Thanks for your sympathy.
Please be seated.

1076
01:03:24,742 --> 01:03:25,958
What's the matter, Mr. Radheram?

1077
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:28,262
Mr. Basant owes a loan.

1078
01:03:28,502 --> 01:03:32,018
- Loan?
- Yes. He had borrowed a loan from them.

1079
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:33,902
Loan? How much money?

1080
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:37,355
- About Rs.15 lakh.
- 15 lakh?

1081
01:03:38,557 --> 01:03:40,197
Where shall I get
such a huge amount from?

1082
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:42,749
Do you all want me
to become homeless?

1083
01:03:43,229 --> 01:03:44,589
Should I wander from lane to lane?

1084
01:03:44,669 --> 01:03:47,909
We've not come to make you
homeless but to derive our loan.

1085
01:03:48,812 --> 01:03:51,149
Okay, sir. Goodbye.

1086
01:03:57,395 --> 01:03:59,730
No. Stop.

1087
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:03,958
His soul won't bear
the burden of your loan.

1088
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:05,720
He is my son.

1089
01:04:06,565 --> 01:04:09,785
He was my child, good or bad.

1090
01:04:10,866 --> 01:04:13,001
Let me go bankrupt
or become a beggar..

1091
01:04:13,796 --> 01:04:19,081
But after his death I
can't hear anyone accusing him.

1092
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:24,001
Go. You will get your entire amount.

1093
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:40,332
Master, take me along too.

1094
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,452
How can a helpless person
like me support you, Mangat?

1095
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,332
Everything is gone.

1096
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:50,683
I'll live in a
starving condition with you.

1097
01:04:51,342 --> 01:04:57,072
No, Mangat, I don't want to
share my misfortune with you.

1098
01:04:57,245 --> 01:05:02,612
- Master.
- Okay. May God bless you all.

1099
01:05:07,051 --> 01:05:08,332
Let's go.

1100
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:37,699
It is small but
spacious and airy. I love it.

1101
01:05:38,229 --> 01:05:40,495
- How did you like it, dear?
- It's fantastic.

1102
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:45,354
She will definitely like it.
She has wrecked the good one.

1103
01:05:45,434 --> 01:05:46,695
What's wrong with you?

1104
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:51,775
Forget the past. Try to be
happy with what you have.

1105
01:05:51,855 --> 01:05:53,695
If we were destined to be happy..

1106
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:55,474
Why had this unlucky girl
come to our house as a bride?

1107
01:05:55,498 --> 01:05:57,061
What is this poor
girl's fault in this?

1108
01:05:57,141 --> 01:06:00,301
Why don't you understand?
It is completely her fault.

1109
01:06:00,532 --> 01:06:01,757
She is unfortunate.

1110
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:04,541
She is responsible
for our destruction.

1111
01:06:04,621 --> 01:06:07,419
Fear God, Sharda. Fear God.

1112
01:06:08,186 --> 01:06:13,215
If you want to allege, she
can accuse us as unlucky too.

1113
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:17,061
She can say that she
didn't get any peace..

1114
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:21,161
Since the day she came
to our house as a bride.

1115
01:06:21,832 --> 01:06:25,875
We both snatched her
husband from her forever.

1116
01:06:26,686 --> 01:06:28,421
We have made her a widow.

1117
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:31,461
If she thinks so, why
doesn't she go away from here?

1118
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:35,646
- Mother?
- Yes. What do you have here now?

1119
01:06:35,726 --> 01:06:39,141
Basant's mother,
don't ever repeat this.

1120
01:06:39,981 --> 01:06:41,472
She was our
daughter-in-law earlier..

1121
01:06:42,337 --> 01:06:44,311
But now, she is our daughter.

1122
01:06:44,554 --> 01:06:49,970
Anil and Poornima won't go
away from my sight till I'm alive.

1123
01:06:50,348 --> 01:06:53,073
You are out of your senses.

1124
01:06:53,299 --> 01:06:55,273
You won't understand me.

1125
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:57,513
Remember, you will repent.

1126
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:01,913
She will make you beg one day.
She'll make you beg.

1127
01:07:06,803 --> 01:07:12,715
Dear, don't mind her talks.
She used to really love Basant.

1128
01:07:13,483 --> 01:07:15,353
He was her only son.

1129
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:17,721
She has gone mad with grief.

1130
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:21,193
She has forgotten
what is right and wrong.

1131
01:07:30,553 --> 01:07:34,245
Don't cry. Don't cry,
my prince. My prince.

1132
01:07:34,325 --> 01:07:37,250
Oh, my prince. Look,
it's such a big ball.

1133
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:40,090
I ask, why does this
family leave the child alone?

1134
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:42,490
Am I your servant that
I'll always carry you?

1135
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:46,330
I say calm down. Become quiet.

1136
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:55,764
"Calm down, the result
of love of two hearts."

1137
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:07,170
"Calm down, the darling
nephew of your uncle."

1138
01:08:09,698 --> 01:08:16,930
"Lullaby. Lullaby."

1139
01:08:17,363 --> 01:08:25,363
"The women sing lullabies and
make the children go to sleep."

1140
01:08:26,756 --> 01:08:30,489
"The men can also do this."

1141
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:32,089
"Man, live long."

1142
01:08:32,325 --> 01:08:35,850
"Now, there will be a test."

1143
01:08:36,724 --> 01:08:39,570
"A test."

1144
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:43,264
"A test."

1145
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:55,690
Hey? You are crying again?

1146
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:59,688
"Smile, oh, darling."

1147
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:03,980
"Smile, oh, darling."

1148
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:13,106
"No flower is as beautiful..
As your face."

1149
01:09:14,563 --> 01:09:17,705
"Smile, oh, darling."

1150
01:09:17,785 --> 01:09:21,320
"Smile, oh, darling."

1151
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:30,768
"The cradle is rocking.
Go to sleep."

1152
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:38,077
You are crying again?
I say keep quiet.

1153
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:39,754
Don't I've any value?

1154
01:09:41,106 --> 01:09:42,128
Keep quiet.

1155
01:09:42,403 --> 01:09:45,982
"It's bad to cry. It
is a tuneless melody."

1156
01:09:46,156 --> 01:09:49,608
"It is the women who weep.
The girls cry."

1157
01:09:49,688 --> 01:09:53,288
"Why should my darling cry?
Why should my child cry?"

1158
01:09:53,368 --> 01:09:56,848
"The other children are so good."

1159
01:09:56,928 --> 01:10:00,748
"They always smile.
They never shed tears."

1160
01:10:00,828 --> 01:10:04,128
"Everyone loves them.
Everyone loves them."

1161
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:07,848
"Everyone loves them.
Everyone loves them."

1162
01:10:08,023 --> 01:10:11,503
"Look what I've
become to make you smile."

1163
01:10:11,698 --> 01:10:15,107
"Look what I've
become to make you smile."

1164
01:10:15,187 --> 01:10:18,747
"Sometimes I twist my waist,
sometimes dance my glance."

1165
01:10:18,827 --> 01:10:22,321
"I've a slim waist.
I've a piercing glance."

1166
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:25,900
"Oh, my, my! My waist.
Watch my waist."

1167
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:29,507
"Look how I twist my waist.
My graceful waist."

1168
01:10:29,587 --> 01:10:33,044
"Look how I blush.
Look how I feel shy."

1169
01:10:33,124 --> 01:10:36,507
"If anyone sees me without you.."

1170
01:10:36,587 --> 01:10:39,994
"I fear this. He will
keep a watch on me."

1171
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:41,667
"He will keep a watch on me."

1172
01:10:41,747 --> 01:10:43,347
"He will keep a watch on me."

1173
01:10:43,427 --> 01:10:45,067
"He will keep a watch on me."

1174
01:10:45,147 --> 01:10:47,092
"He will keep a watch on me."

1175
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:57,795
"Dear, it was someone
else's fault. Don't punish me."

1176
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:08,747
"No flower is as beautiful..
As your face."

1177
01:11:09,827 --> 01:11:12,827
"Smile, oh, darling."

1178
01:11:13,025 --> 01:11:17,907
"Smile, oh, darling."

1179
01:11:34,786 --> 01:11:38,427
"You are under your
mummy's oath. Your daddy's oath."

1180
01:11:38,643 --> 01:11:42,067
"Stop crying. Don't be stubborn."

1181
01:11:42,226 --> 01:11:45,652
"The one who eats grams
with a smile becomes healthy."

1182
01:11:45,732 --> 01:11:49,347
"The one who eats almonds
while crying becomes weak."

1183
01:11:49,427 --> 01:11:53,069
"The nightingale sang. The
one who cries is a fool."

1184
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:58,581
"The nightingale sang. The
one who cries is a fool."

1185
01:11:58,776 --> 01:12:00,427
"He is a fool."

1186
01:12:00,507 --> 01:12:02,187
"He is a fool."

1187
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:03,868
"He is a fool."

1188
01:12:03,948 --> 01:12:05,747
"He is a fool."

1189
01:12:05,987 --> 01:12:07,576
"Calm down, don't cry."

1190
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:09,427
"Please don't cry, dear."

1191
01:12:09,507 --> 01:12:13,002
"Don't make a noise now.
Don't make me bore."

1192
01:12:13,082 --> 01:12:16,587
"Don't hurt me.
Don't make me angry."

1193
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:20,107
"I request you. I beg at your feet."

1194
01:12:20,187 --> 01:12:23,653
"Listen to me. Understand it."

1195
01:12:23,733 --> 01:12:29,187
"Understand it. Understand it."

1196
01:12:29,501 --> 01:12:32,187
I'm tired but still you
don't understand, shameless boy.

1197
01:12:35,134 --> 01:12:43,134
"If you still don't become silent,
I'll smash your face."

1198
01:12:45,788 --> 01:12:53,788
"No flower is as beautiful..
As your face."

1199
01:12:54,987 --> 01:12:58,067
"Smile, oh, darling."

1200
01:12:58,302 --> 01:13:01,178
"Smile, oh, darling."

1201
01:13:01,258 --> 01:13:03,507
"Smile! Smile! Smile!"

1202
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:20,925
Sister, take milk.

1203
01:13:21,406 --> 01:13:23,730
No, Brother. Stop delivering
the milk to us from today.

1204
01:13:24,162 --> 01:13:27,935
- Why? Won't little master drink milk?
- No.

1205
01:13:31,092 --> 01:13:32,746
He doesn't like milk anymore.

1206
01:13:34,237 --> 01:13:40,020
- Grandfather, I love milk.
- Yes, my child. Yes.

1207
01:14:04,121 --> 01:14:07,686
- Where are you going, Father?
- In search of some job.

1208
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:09,595
You had high blood
pressure yesterday.

1209
01:14:09,675 --> 01:14:11,739
The doctor has
recommended you to take rest.

1210
01:14:12,409 --> 01:14:14,485
The doctor is my old friend.

1211
01:14:15,739 --> 01:14:19,144
He still sees me as Seth Ratanlal..

1212
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:23,275
Who can rest for
years on his telling.

1213
01:14:23,468 --> 01:14:26,115
Whatever you say, I won't
let you go without asking him.

1214
01:14:26,366 --> 01:14:28,435
Silly, nothing will happen to me.

1215
01:14:29,195 --> 01:14:31,115
I'm born with a long life.

1216
01:14:32,195 --> 01:14:33,875
I wonder what else
I have to see more.

1217
01:14:35,035 --> 01:14:38,955
Look, this hand used to feed
thousands of people yesterday.

1218
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:45,875
And today it can't give a
drop of milk to his grandson.

1219
01:14:46,344 --> 01:14:49,515
He will get
everything if you are alive.

1220
01:14:49,934 --> 01:14:51,069
Please take rest.

1221
01:14:51,149 --> 01:14:53,675
No, dear, let me go.

1222
01:14:54,572 --> 01:14:58,842
- I promise to visit the doctor too. Okay?
- Yes.

1223
01:15:27,399 --> 01:15:30,719
Sir, I don't
understand how to explain you.

1224
01:15:31,134 --> 01:15:34,279
You need complete rest.
Complete rest.

1225
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,648
That is fine, Doctor.
But what should I do?

1226
01:15:39,264 --> 01:15:41,490
I'll have to do some work to feed..

1227
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:44,810
My wife, widow
daughter-in-law and orphan grandson.

1228
01:15:45,901 --> 01:15:47,459
If I won't do this, then who will?

1229
01:15:47,539 --> 01:15:50,292
But have you ever thought
what will happen to them..

1230
01:15:50,372 --> 01:15:51,438
When you are no more?

1231
01:15:53,946 --> 01:15:55,870
You are the support to
those helpless ones.

1232
01:15:56,216 --> 01:15:59,038
That's why I'm telling you
to take care of your health.

1233
01:15:59,244 --> 01:16:02,098
Take rest and
continue the same medicine.

1234
01:16:18,152 --> 01:16:19,518
'But have you ever thought
what will happen to them..'

1235
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:20,564
'..when you are no more?'

1236
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,802
'What about them
after you are no more?'

1237
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:27,093
'What about them
after you are no more?'

1238
01:16:38,304 --> 01:16:46,304
"Oh, countrymen, you
call woman a Goddess."

1239
01:16:46,942 --> 01:16:54,942
"Sons of mothers and brothers
of sisters, listen to my story."

1240
01:16:55,753 --> 01:17:03,753
"Oh, countrymen, you
call woman a Goddess."

1241
01:17:04,432 --> 01:17:12,432
"Sons of mothers and brothers
of sisters, listen to my story."

1242
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:17,721
"Please listen to my story."

1243
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:38,445
"I embraced the thorns which
destiny spread on my path."

1244
01:17:39,343 --> 01:17:47,343
"But I'm unfortunate that
you didn't approve it too."

1245
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:52,523
"Such a typhoon arrived.
Such a storm struck."

1246
01:17:52,726 --> 01:17:56,832
"The queen of the palace
became a beggar today."

1247
01:17:56,912 --> 01:18:01,580
"Please listen to my story."

1248
01:18:16,716 --> 01:18:20,890
"I wander from lane-to-lane today."

1249
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:24,901
"I'm starving without food."

1250
01:18:25,432 --> 01:18:33,432
"The people flung coins
but no one gave food."

1251
01:18:34,316 --> 01:18:38,672
"Every heart is lousy,
every night is hungry."

1252
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:42,992
"Lust has made everyone deceit."

1253
01:18:43,214 --> 01:18:47,938
"Please listen to my story."

1254
01:19:00,316 --> 01:19:08,316
"This little child is
your own countryman."

1255
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:17,321
"When he begs from you, the
sky will bow out of shame."

1256
01:19:18,262 --> 01:19:22,445
"But still, it will
have no effect on you."

1257
01:19:22,683 --> 01:19:26,912
"This life is a game for you."

1258
01:19:26,992 --> 01:19:31,450
"Please listen to my story."

1259
01:19:33,785 --> 01:19:41,785
"Oh, countrymen, you
call woman a Goddess."

1260
01:19:42,512 --> 01:19:50,512
"Sons of mothers and brothers
of sisters, listen to my story."

1261
01:19:51,232 --> 01:19:55,432
"Please listen to my story."

1262
01:19:55,512 --> 01:20:00,758
"Please listen to my story."

1263
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,304
Oh, God!

1264
01:20:11,169 --> 01:20:12,499
Are you blind? Unlucky girl!

1265
01:20:12,672 --> 01:20:13,912
See how you caused an ill omen?

1266
01:20:14,045 --> 01:20:15,697
Had I not told you to
stay out of my sight?

1267
01:20:15,721 --> 01:20:16,857
It's is 'karwachauth' (fast
observed by married women).

1268
01:20:16,881 --> 01:20:18,217
It's a festival for women
whose husbands are still alive.

1269
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:19,841
Tell me, why did you
come in front of me?

1270
01:20:19,866 --> 01:20:21,377
I had come to give
Arun a drink of water.

1271
01:20:21,401 --> 01:20:23,961
I understand everything.
You did this deliberately.

1272
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:25,801
- No, that's not true.
- Quiet!

1273
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:27,721
You dare call me a liar?

1274
01:20:27,999 --> 01:20:30,036
If you consider yourself
a paragon of honesty..

1275
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:31,961
- Go stay with your father.
- Mother..

1276
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,641
I'm in no way related to you.
Our relationship is finished.

1277
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:36,461
- Mother, you..
- Get out of my sight.

1278
01:20:36,721 --> 01:20:38,801
I won't let you stay
even a moment in this house.

1279
01:20:38,936 --> 01:20:40,428
Get out. Get out of here.

1280
01:20:44,745 --> 01:20:46,627
Why did your hands not break..

1281
01:20:46,707 --> 01:20:48,347
Before they struck
our daughter-in-law?

1282
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:49,801
Don't you dare say anything to me.

1283
01:20:49,961 --> 01:20:52,058
Whatever you want to say,
say it to this wretched girl.

1284
01:20:52,082 --> 01:20:53,297
She already brought about
her own husband's death..

1285
01:20:53,321 --> 01:20:55,281
And now, wants to
bring about my death as well.

1286
01:20:55,408 --> 01:20:56,594
No, Mother.

1287
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:04,428
Everything was lost.
Only compassion remained.

1288
01:21:05,043 --> 01:21:06,721
Today, you
finished that off as well.

1289
01:21:06,801 --> 01:21:08,641
- But..
- Get out of my sight!

1290
01:21:10,942 --> 01:21:12,622
May you have a long
and happy married life.

1291
01:21:21,137 --> 01:21:23,236
Today, seeing you both like this..

1292
01:21:23,316 --> 01:21:25,236
I feel like every
dream of mine has come true.

1293
01:21:25,476 --> 01:21:28,217
May God always preserve your union.

1294
01:21:28,337 --> 01:21:32,513
Father, if I've ever made a
mistake, please forgive me.

1295
01:21:33,057 --> 01:21:34,817
I'm the one who
should ask forgiveness.

1296
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,627
My newlywed daughter is leaving..

1297
01:21:36,651 --> 01:21:37,817
For her husband's place.

1298
01:21:38,442 --> 01:21:40,257
And I'm so helpless as to stand..

1299
01:21:40,337 --> 01:21:41,617
Empty-handed in front of her.

1300
01:21:41,974 --> 01:21:43,618
Instead of giving her something..

1301
01:21:44,194 --> 01:21:45,897
I want to ask for something.

1302
01:21:46,812 --> 01:21:49,337
And I'm afraid that a father..

1303
01:21:49,417 --> 01:21:50,817
May be turned away empty-handed.

1304
01:21:52,276 --> 01:21:55,404
Why would that ever be?
At least try telling me.

1305
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:59,451
- Let Anil remain with us.
- Father!

1306
01:22:00,111 --> 01:22:02,951
I don't have the right to
take a son away from his mother.

1307
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:07,471
But if he stays with us, the
desolate life that stretches..

1308
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:11,791
Ahead of us would be lit
by his innocent presence.

1309
01:22:13,088 --> 01:22:17,238
Say yes. Who would take
better care of Anil than uncle?

1310
01:22:17,489 --> 01:22:19,031
And we'll be staying in
this very city, after all.

1311
01:22:19,055 --> 01:22:20,495
We'll come meet
him whenever we wish.

1312
01:22:22,633 --> 01:22:26,638
Let it be, Prakash. I don't
wish to sadden my daughter.

1313
01:22:26,718 --> 01:22:30,634
No, Father. Your
happiness matters more than mine.

1314
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:34,351
Anil will remain with you
for as long as you wish.

1315
01:22:35,105 --> 01:22:38,529
Bless you, dear.
That's what I wanted to hear.

1316
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:41,351
All right. Come, let's go.

1317
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:46,220
Welcome. A warm welcome. Come in.

1318
01:22:46,487 --> 01:22:47,487
Please, come on in.

1319
01:22:47,992 --> 01:22:49,231
What are you standing there for?

1320
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:50,655
Perform the welcome ritual quickly.

1321
01:22:56,087 --> 01:22:58,284
One moment. I'll perform it too.

1322
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:01,700
I'm dead. I don't have any money.

1323
01:23:02,021 --> 01:23:03,767
Brother-in-law, lend me Re.1.

1324
01:23:04,191 --> 01:23:05,791
I'll pay you back
the day after tomorrow.

1325
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:11,540
May God preserve your union.
Now, come on in.

1326
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,964
And now go on to your room. Go.

1327
01:23:14,379 --> 01:23:17,216
Brother-in-law, your
choice is fantastic.

1328
01:23:28,113 --> 01:23:30,992
Why are you looking so vexed?

1329
01:23:31,284 --> 01:23:32,364
My heart is burning.

1330
01:23:32,604 --> 01:23:34,604
Shall I call the fire
department to douse the fire?

1331
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,044
Don't joke. I told you,
my heart is burning.

1332
01:23:37,272 --> 01:23:40,044
It's I whose heart is burning.
Unlike brother-in-law..

1333
01:23:40,124 --> 01:23:42,924
Lord didn't bless me
with such a happy day.

1334
01:23:43,335 --> 01:23:44,995
- What?
- Nothing.

1335
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,814
I'm troubled, and you're
in the mood for jokes?

1336
01:23:48,377 --> 01:23:50,604
You know, Sunil's
stepmother has arrived.

1337
01:23:51,364 --> 01:23:53,124
She'll make the poor
boy's life miserable.

1338
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:57,524
What are you saying? This
poor lady is a very good sort.

1339
01:23:57,604 --> 01:23:58,686
A kind-hearted soul.

1340
01:23:58,844 --> 01:24:02,405
Let it be. I've seen a
fine example of her goodness.

1341
01:24:02,941 --> 01:24:04,221
She fell in love with brother..

1342
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:07,101
But married
someone else for money.

1343
01:24:07,759 --> 01:24:10,684
I remember all that very well.
I haven't forgotten it.

1344
01:24:13,614 --> 01:24:16,831
Poonam, remember,
you had once told me..

1345
01:24:17,921 --> 01:24:19,801
That life doesn't
teach us to turn and call..

1346
01:24:20,023 --> 01:24:22,523
- But rather to move ahead.
- Yes.

1347
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:26,960
But today, life and time
have both turned back.

1348
01:24:27,548 --> 01:24:33,048
It seems destiny realised
its mistake while unfolding..

1349
01:24:33,697 --> 01:24:35,816
And turning time back,
it started again..

1350
01:24:36,465 --> 01:24:39,301
At the very point where
it had made the mistake.

1351
01:24:39,517 --> 01:24:43,773
And it could also be
that it took pity on me..

1352
01:24:44,698 --> 01:24:49,281
And for my happiness, it
sent back my cooling Poornima.

1353
01:25:08,738 --> 01:25:09,818
Munna!

1354
01:25:13,887 --> 01:25:14,887
Where are you going, Son?

1355
01:25:15,055 --> 01:25:16,978
- Outside, to sleep.
- Why outside?

1356
01:25:17,382 --> 01:25:20,738
Aunt Naina said that
this is my stepmother..

1357
01:25:20,818 --> 01:25:22,458
And she will beat me.

1358
01:25:22,538 --> 01:25:23,818
No, Son. You shouldn't say that.

1359
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:28,228
What your aunt Naina said was a lie.

1360
01:25:28,738 --> 01:25:32,907
- I.. I'm your mother.
- My mother?

1361
01:25:33,072 --> 01:25:38,058
Yes. Come to your mother. Come.

1362
01:25:41,288 --> 01:25:43,218
- Come, Son.
- Mom!

1363
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,138
Mom, you won't go
away now, will you?

1364
01:25:47,696 --> 01:25:50,138
No, Son. I'll never go.

1365
01:25:50,628 --> 01:25:53,914
- Mom, don't ride in a car.
- Why?

1366
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:58,618
When mom rides in car,
she doesn't come back.

1367
01:25:59,042 --> 01:26:03,756
It won't be so. My son..

1368
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:16,133
Enough, Mother. I'm getting late.

1369
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,936
Otherwise, the teacher will
tell me to stand on the bench.

1370
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,722
Have breakfast first.
Then go to school.

1371
01:26:19,802 --> 01:26:22,298
No, Mother. I'm not at
all hungry. Okay, bye.

1372
01:26:26,262 --> 01:26:29,378
- Dad, bye.
- Bye. Hey, wait!

1373
01:26:30,854 --> 01:26:32,458
- You forgot again?
- What?

1374
01:26:32,538 --> 01:26:36,129
A kiss. Come on, give it quick.

1375
01:26:37,895 --> 01:26:40,463
- My share is still remaining.
- But I'm getting late.

1376
01:26:40,543 --> 01:26:42,291
I don't want to hear any excuses.
Give a cheek here.

1377
01:26:42,315 --> 01:26:45,366
This sweet cheek is mom's.
This sour one is yours.

1378
01:26:45,446 --> 01:26:46,901
Fine. If not an orange,
I'll make do with a lemon.

1379
01:26:46,925 --> 01:26:48,695
- Which one is mine?
- Me, first.

1380
01:26:48,775 --> 01:26:49,780
- No. Me, first.
- Me, first. -

1381
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,221
- Me, first.
- Me, first.

1382
01:26:51,301 --> 01:26:53,652
Do one thing. Both of you,
get it together.

1383
01:26:57,958 --> 01:27:03,402
- When I say, "Ready. One. Two. Go." Then kiss.
- Okay.

1384
01:27:03,726 --> 01:27:09,770
Ready? 1.2. Go.

1385
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:14,898
It's a good opportunity.
Let's take it further.

1386
01:27:17,182 --> 01:27:18,402
Why are you shushing me?

1387
01:27:18,482 --> 01:27:20,097
You have no sense of time and place.

1388
01:27:20,177 --> 01:27:21,343
What if someone comes in?

1389
01:27:21,594 --> 01:27:23,074
- Shall I close the door?
- Be quiet.

1390
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:24,399
- No, I won't be quiet.
- Let go. - No, I won't be quiet.

1391
01:27:24,423 --> 01:27:25,743
I won't.

1392
01:27:31,298 --> 01:27:36,583
Hello? Yes. What did you say?
All right, I'll be right there.

1393
01:27:36,823 --> 01:27:39,063
- What happened?
- Aunt is very ill.

1394
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,583
Let's go quickly.

1395
01:27:45,387 --> 01:27:51,343
Doctor! Gautam's mother!

1396
01:27:54,278 --> 01:27:58,385
If I have a worry now,
it's only about Anil.

1397
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:01,473
He's an innocent child.

1398
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:07,545
He should have his meals on time.
He should study on time.

1399
01:28:08,289 --> 01:28:10,078
Now that your mother is no more..

1400
01:28:11,444 --> 01:28:13,866
There's no one in this
house to take care of all that.

1401
01:28:15,432 --> 01:28:21,616
So, I want to return
your child to you.

1402
01:28:21,892 --> 01:28:26,943
- Grandpa!
- What is it, Son?

1403
01:28:27,108 --> 01:28:29,638
Grandma has gone to heaven,
hasn't she?

1404
01:28:30,766 --> 01:28:32,958
- Yes, Son.
- When will she come back?

1405
01:28:34,805 --> 01:28:37,461
It'll be quite a while, Son.

1406
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:43,350
- Grandpa, I'll go to grandma.
- No, Son. Don't say that.

1407
01:28:43,704 --> 01:28:48,453
Son, your mother has come to
fetch you. You'll go with her.

1408
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:50,858
That's why I brought Anil with me.

1409
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:53,824
It's a good thing. Your
everyday bother is done with.

1410
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:55,540
Go, take him along
and serve him dinner.

1411
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:56,592
Anil!

1412
01:28:58,537 --> 01:28:59,679
Sunil!

1413
01:29:01,115 --> 01:29:03,209
- How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

1414
01:29:03,289 --> 01:29:05,502
I'm fine too. You're
here after quite a few days.

1415
01:29:05,665 --> 01:29:07,974
Mom, I won't let Anil go back today.

1416
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:09,937
Yes, Son. He won't go anywhere now.

1417
01:29:10,076 --> 01:29:11,728
- He'll stay with you.
- Really?

1418
01:29:12,156 --> 01:29:15,156
Yes. Now onwards, both
my sons will stay with me.

1419
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:17,596
Great! It'll be
great fun then. Come.

1420
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,356
So, finally, my
worst fears came true.

1421
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:36,324
What happened?

1422
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,167
It was fine that he
would visit occasionally.

1423
01:29:38,538 --> 01:29:41,557
- But Anil staying here permanently isn't a good idea.
- Why?

1424
01:29:41,637 --> 01:29:44,048
Because his staying
here would be a risk.

1425
01:29:44,393 --> 01:29:46,391
Sunil would be
spoilt staying with him.

1426
01:29:46,471 --> 01:29:47,679
What are you saying, Naina?

1427
01:29:47,947 --> 01:29:49,936
Anil is no thief or
hooligan to spoil Sunil.

1428
01:29:50,016 --> 01:29:51,319
Whose son is he, after all?

1429
01:29:51,479 --> 01:29:53,914
The apple never
falls far from the tree.

1430
01:29:53,994 --> 01:29:56,517
You should feel ashamed to
malign an innocent child.

1431
01:29:56,597 --> 01:30:00,366
Innocent child? A rogue's
child can never be innocent.

1432
01:30:00,664 --> 01:30:03,584
- Don't forget who his father was, Brother.
- Meenu!

1433
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:09,344
- A wretch, a rogue, an idiot. - Shut up!
- That who Anil's father was.

1434
01:30:09,424 --> 01:30:13,064
Get out of here. I say, get out!

1435
01:30:13,144 --> 01:30:15,378
Fine. Destroy
yourself as you please.

1436
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:17,584
Ruin your son in that
wretched boy's company.

1437
01:30:22,786 --> 01:30:25,266
Am I this house's live-in
brother-in-law or the butler?

1438
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:27,386
I'm sometimes cutting potatoes,
sometimes onions..

1439
01:30:27,466 --> 01:30:28,626
And sometimes pumpkins.

1440
01:30:28,843 --> 01:30:31,186
I don't understand what my
position is in this house.

1441
01:30:31,266 --> 01:30:34,106
I've been reduced to a hired help.

1442
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:38,026
Oh, God. How can I
do all the work alone?

1443
01:30:38,106 --> 01:30:39,845
I still have to do the ironing.

1444
01:30:39,925 --> 01:30:42,026
That iron is so hot!

1445
01:30:42,206 --> 01:30:46,266
And I have to hang the
clothes to dry as well.

1446
01:30:46,386 --> 01:30:48,386
They're going to
wring me dry one day.

1447
01:30:56,744 --> 01:31:00,610
"Uncle, tell the truth."

1448
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:04,820
"Uncle, tell the truth."

1449
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:08,065
"Why do you slave for your wife?"

1450
01:31:08,145 --> 01:31:11,706
"Why do you, a man, fear a woman?"

1451
01:31:11,786 --> 01:31:15,417
"Son, my wretched fate.."

1452
01:31:15,497 --> 01:31:19,050
"Son, my wretched fate.."

1453
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:22,866
"I ruined my own life."

1454
01:31:22,946 --> 01:31:26,107
"I made a mess of my own life."

1455
01:31:26,187 --> 01:31:30,266
"Son, my wretched fate.."

1456
01:31:45,955 --> 01:31:53,340
"Son, I thought she was
some delicate flower."

1457
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:56,466
"Some delicate flower."

1458
01:31:57,016 --> 01:32:00,632
"But when I finally met her.."

1459
01:32:00,712 --> 01:32:04,323
"She turned out to
be a thorny shrub."

1460
01:32:04,403 --> 01:32:06,803
"A thorny shrub."

1461
01:32:06,883 --> 01:32:08,083
- "Really?
- Yes."

1462
01:32:08,163 --> 01:32:13,083
"Lord Krishna has
turned his face away.."

1463
01:32:13,163 --> 01:32:18,243
"From this wretched Chimanlal."

1464
01:32:18,323 --> 01:32:21,963
"Gulfam was killed unnecessarily."

1465
01:32:22,043 --> 01:32:25,483
"The coward has become a king now."

1466
01:32:25,563 --> 01:32:29,083
"Gulfam was killed unnecessarily."

1467
01:32:29,163 --> 01:32:32,832
"The coward has become a king now."

1468
01:32:48,643 --> 01:32:55,723
"You've already spent your life, the
rest you'll spend it the same way."

1469
01:32:55,959 --> 01:32:59,643
- "The rest you'll spend it the same way.
- Wonderful."

1470
01:32:59,723 --> 01:33:07,723
"My luck never supports me."

1471
01:33:10,772 --> 01:33:14,474
"That I get married soon
after the engagement.."

1472
01:33:14,554 --> 01:33:18,066
"That I get married soon
after the engagement.."

1473
01:33:18,146 --> 01:33:20,944
"Was my mother's wish."

1474
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:24,796
"She left for Lord's abode.."

1475
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,424
"leaving me balanced
on the knife's edge."

1476
01:33:28,504 --> 01:33:34,344
"Ever since, the
quarrels escalated."

1477
01:33:34,424 --> 01:33:35,664
"Enough! Enough!"

1478
01:33:35,744 --> 01:33:39,265
"Ever since, the
quarrels escalated."

1479
01:33:39,345 --> 01:33:43,664
"She would thrash
and abuse me a lot."

1480
01:33:44,956 --> 01:33:48,264
"She would thrash
and abuse you a lot."

1481
01:33:48,432 --> 01:33:52,024
"Son, my wretched fate.."

1482
01:33:52,104 --> 01:33:55,664
"Son, my wretched fate.."

1483
01:33:55,744 --> 01:33:59,264
"I ruined my own life."

1484
01:33:59,344 --> 01:34:02,824
"I made a mess of my own life."

1485
01:34:02,904 --> 01:34:06,184
- "Uncle..
- Yes, tell me."

1486
01:34:06,379 --> 01:34:10,078
- "Uncle..
- Tell me, Son."

1487
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:13,584
- "Uncle..
- Son.."

1488
01:34:14,066 --> 01:34:17,102
- "Uncle..
- Yes.."

1489
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:27,058
- How is that?
- Great.

1490
01:34:27,551 --> 01:34:31,819
- It's truly realistic.
- Then get ready.

1491
01:34:34,528 --> 01:34:36,888
Aunt Naina.. Aunt Naina?

1492
01:34:37,528 --> 01:34:39,768
- Aunt Naina?
- What is it?

1493
01:34:39,968 --> 01:34:41,808
You had told me to stop
talking to Anil, right?

1494
01:34:41,868 --> 01:34:44,888
I've ended our friendship.
I'll never talk to him again.

1495
01:34:45,128 --> 01:34:47,288
Well done. My son is very good.

1496
01:34:48,368 --> 01:34:50,700
Aunt Naina, have you
ever seen the pawn?

1497
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:53,528
- No.
- Well, look to your heart's fill.

1498
01:34:54,834 --> 01:34:55,958
Oh, God!

1499
01:34:59,028 --> 01:35:00,688
I'll deal with you both right now.

1500
01:35:09,302 --> 01:35:11,378
Wait, you idiots. I'll show you now.

1501
01:35:16,109 --> 01:35:17,562
I'll deal with you now.

1502
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:29,368
Wait right there.
Scamp.. Get lost. Let go.

1503
01:35:29,565 --> 01:35:31,412
- Don't you have any shame to behave like that.
- Help!

1504
01:35:31,436 --> 01:35:32,930
- You're getting spoilt.
- Wait.

1505
01:35:33,981 --> 01:35:34,850
Why are you hitting him?

1506
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:38,145
How could I not hit him?
Who are you to ask?

1507
01:35:38,422 --> 01:35:39,753
Do I need to tell you that?

1508
01:35:39,969 --> 01:35:42,011
If you hit the children again,
I won't spare you.

1509
01:35:42,091 --> 01:35:44,734
I'm hitting my
brother's son, not your child.

1510
01:35:44,814 --> 01:35:46,438
Naina! There's a limit to vileness.

1511
01:35:46,617 --> 01:35:48,113
Don't you feel
ashamed to pit such venom..

1512
01:35:48,137 --> 01:35:50,353
In front of the children?
Don't ever say such a thing again.

1513
01:35:50,377 --> 01:35:52,377
I'll say it not just
once but a thousand times.

1514
01:35:52,675 --> 01:35:54,297
Who are you to shut me up?

1515
01:35:54,617 --> 01:35:56,297
I have more right
to him than you do.

1516
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,457
What are you to him?
Just his stepmother, right?

1517
01:35:59,537 --> 01:36:01,777
- Stop your nonsense, or I'll kill you!
- Poornima!

1518
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,588
I'm sick of these daily fights.
What's going on here?

1519
01:36:05,668 --> 01:36:08,137
Ask your mother. What right
does she have to hit Sunil?

1520
01:36:08,217 --> 01:36:10,057
The right a sister has
on her brother's child.

1521
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:11,697
He's turned into a mischief-maker.

1522
01:36:12,023 --> 01:36:14,777
Look what a plight he
reduced me to, brother.

1523
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,683
Sunil, why did you do this?

1524
01:36:16,763 --> 01:36:19,754
Aunt Naina was hitting Sunil.
That's why he bit her.

1525
01:36:19,834 --> 01:36:21,527
You be quiet. I'm not asking you.

1526
01:36:22,729 --> 01:36:24,303
Being insolent with
your aunt? Speak up!

1527
01:36:24,383 --> 01:36:26,742
Children should be talked
to gently, not thrashed.

1528
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:29,519
I don't like the
behaviour he's indulging in now.

1529
01:36:29,599 --> 01:36:33,021
Then tell her as well not
to go after them. Come on.

1530
01:36:36,774 --> 01:36:39,576
Did you see how he's
gotten influenced by him?

1531
01:36:39,988 --> 01:36:41,388
This is what I was worried about.

1532
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:44,548
His behaviour has changed
since that wretch came here.

1533
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:47,388
Brother, if you still do
nothing now, you'll regret it.

1534
01:37:10,331 --> 01:37:11,655
It's been so many days now..

1535
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:14,131
But the fever isn't coming down.

1536
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:17,130
I wonder what sort of
medicine the doctor is prescribing.

1537
01:37:17,217 --> 01:37:19,411
Surely, mother is
suffering from some evil eye.

1538
01:37:19,571 --> 01:37:22,499
Until we go to Lord Shiva's
temple and make an offering..

1539
01:37:22,579 --> 01:37:24,411
Mother's health won't improve.

1540
01:37:24,651 --> 01:37:26,731
Lord Shiva's temple?
How do you know?

1541
01:37:27,146 --> 01:37:30,811
When I fell ill, grandma
went there and prayed.

1542
01:37:31,038 --> 01:37:32,051
I got well then.

1543
01:37:32,206 --> 01:37:34,086
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Come on quickly.

1544
01:37:35,651 --> 01:37:39,051
But where's the
money to buy offerings?

1545
01:37:39,131 --> 01:37:40,361
Come on, let's ask dad for it.

1546
01:37:41,331 --> 01:37:44,811
That's the problem. We can't
tell anyone about the offering.

1547
01:37:44,971 --> 01:37:46,925
If we tell anyone about the prayer..

1548
01:37:47,005 --> 01:37:49,935
Its effect will be
finished and mother won't get well.

1549
01:37:55,089 --> 01:37:56,714
- I know where to get the money.
- Where?

1550
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:59,891
In dad's coat. I had seen
him keeping it this morning.

1551
01:38:00,131 --> 01:38:01,651
You go get the
veneration things ready.

1552
01:38:01,731 --> 01:38:03,051
I'll go get the money right away.

1553
01:38:23,663 --> 01:38:26,663
- Stealing, you wretch?
- No, I wasn't stealing.

1554
01:38:26,743 --> 01:38:30,343
- Quiet! I'll hit you if you lie.
- I'm not lying.

1555
01:38:30,423 --> 01:38:32,304
You're as much a liar
as your father. Come on.

1556
01:38:32,384 --> 01:38:34,562
- Dad!
- Don't you dare call me 'dad.'

1557
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:37,143
You're not my blood.
You're in no way related to me.

1558
01:38:37,223 --> 01:38:39,143
Come with me. Come along.

1559
01:38:42,018 --> 01:38:44,396
- Take care of your son.
- What's the matter?

1560
01:38:44,603 --> 01:38:46,323
That which couldn't
even have been imagined.

1561
01:38:46,466 --> 01:38:47,617
He was stealing
money from my wallet.

1562
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:51,591
He was stealing money?
You were stealing?

1563
01:38:51,902 --> 01:38:54,193
I wasn't stealing, Mother.

1564
01:38:54,273 --> 01:38:55,626
Then why did you take the money?

1565
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:59,987
- Tell me. Why did you? Tell me!
- I won't tell you.

1566
01:39:00,067 --> 01:39:01,968
He's already doing this now.

1567
01:39:02,048 --> 01:39:04,010
He'll go on to rob and murder.

1568
01:39:04,165 --> 01:39:05,506
He's going on a very wrong path.

1569
01:39:05,586 --> 01:39:07,867
I won't let him, as long as I live.

1570
01:39:07,947 --> 01:39:09,882
Let alone you, even
God can't stop him.

1571
01:39:10,046 --> 01:39:11,940
No one can cleanse tainted blood.

1572
01:39:12,398 --> 01:39:13,444
Prakash!

1573
01:39:13,586 --> 01:39:15,146
Embers always light a fire.

1574
01:39:15,226 --> 01:39:16,466
Flowers won't grow out of them.

1575
01:39:16,906 --> 01:39:18,506
Letting Sunil
remain in his company..

1576
01:39:18,586 --> 01:39:20,026
Was the worst mistake of my life.

1577
01:39:20,112 --> 01:39:22,404
But now onwards, I won't
let him anywhere near Sunil.

1578
01:39:25,543 --> 01:39:26,586
Why did you steal?

1579
01:39:26,746 --> 01:39:29,586
Tell me why you stole! Tell me!

1580
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:31,506
If you have to do the same thing..

1581
01:39:31,586 --> 01:39:35,506
May God kill me.
Then do whatever you feel like.

1582
01:39:35,586 --> 01:39:38,906
You steal! You steal!

1583
01:39:38,986 --> 01:39:41,906
I'm not a thief,
Mother. I'm not a thief.

1584
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:45,506
A lie! You're lying again!

1585
01:39:45,586 --> 01:39:47,787
Why did you do it? Why?

1586
01:39:47,867 --> 01:39:51,386
Mother, let go of Anil.
He didn't steal.

1587
01:39:51,466 --> 01:39:53,270
Don't hit him. He didn't steal.

1588
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:57,258
We were going to Lord
Shiva's temple to pray for you.

1589
01:39:57,526 --> 01:39:59,022
Look, the things for veneration.

1590
01:40:04,816 --> 01:40:05,862
Anil..

1591
01:40:07,742 --> 01:40:12,742
You did all this for me.
Why didn't you say so? Why?

1592
01:40:13,681 --> 01:40:17,102
If I had, the prayer's
effect would have been ruined.

1593
01:40:17,255 --> 01:40:19,262
How would your fever come down then?

1594
01:40:19,418 --> 01:40:20,662
My dear son..

1595
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:27,962
Please forgive me. How
could I ever have hit you?

1596
01:40:28,905 --> 01:40:32,022
Munna, don't you dare go
anywhere near him again.

1597
01:40:32,102 --> 01:40:34,662
- Come on.
- Listen. You misunderstood. Anil didn't..

1598
01:40:34,742 --> 01:40:36,342
I don't know anything about anyone.

1599
01:40:36,742 --> 01:40:38,182
I'm only concerned about my son.

1600
01:40:38,342 --> 01:40:39,558
Now onwards, they
both will remain apart.

1601
01:40:39,582 --> 01:40:40,865
That's my decision. Come on.

1602
01:40:40,945 --> 01:40:42,342
- Dad!
- Come on, Sunil.

1603
01:40:46,892 --> 01:40:48,856
Come on, Son. Well done.

1604
01:40:56,839 --> 01:40:59,830
Why have you come here?
Get lost. Go!

1605
01:41:07,544 --> 01:41:12,837
Anil.. I didn't like what dad said.

1606
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:15,199
And I don't like you crying either.

1607
01:41:15,492 --> 01:41:17,879
See what nice
firecrackers I've got you.

1608
01:41:18,199 --> 01:41:22,199
No, Brother. If you give
me those, dad will hit you.

1609
01:41:23,017 --> 01:41:25,879
- He won't find out.
- What if he finds out?

1610
01:41:26,096 --> 01:41:28,479
Then I'll take the
beating for you. All right?

1611
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:29,799
Come on.

1612
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:46,619
Here. Those are all for you.

1613
01:41:46,699 --> 01:41:48,879
When they're finished,
I'll get you more.

1614
01:41:50,762 --> 01:41:52,492
I'd hit you before
you did any such thing.

1615
01:41:52,572 --> 01:41:55,147
You were told to keep away
from him. Give those back.

1616
01:41:55,227 --> 01:41:56,834
- I won't.
- Yes, you will.

1617
01:41:56,914 --> 01:41:59,099
- I won't.
- Even your father would. Give those here.

1618
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:00,981
Come with me to brother.
I'll tell him what you're up to.

1619
01:42:01,005 --> 01:42:01,868
I won't go.

1620
01:42:01,948 --> 01:42:04,268
How would you not go? I'll get
you thrashed so thoroughly..

1621
01:42:04,325 --> 01:42:05,763
That you'll never even
speak of this fellow again.

1622
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:06,544
- Come on.
- I won't go.

1623
01:42:06,624 --> 01:42:07,647
- How would you not go?
- I won't go.

1624
01:42:07,671 --> 01:42:08,840
- Come on.
- I won't go.

1625
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:12,805
- Anil!
- Forget Anil.

1626
01:42:12,885 --> 01:42:19,645
- Anil! Anil!
- Come on.

1627
01:42:20,725 --> 01:42:22,245
Brother!

1628
01:42:26,725 --> 01:42:28,215
Brother!

1629
01:42:32,487 --> 01:42:33,741
Brother!

1630
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:35,351
What's going on here?

1631
01:42:36,551 --> 01:42:37,485
Who did this?

1632
01:42:37,565 --> 01:42:42,925
That wretched boy. No one
listens to me. I'm leaving.

1633
01:42:43,005 --> 01:42:46,165
Wait, Naina. I won't leave my
own dear ones for outsiders.

1634
01:42:46,439 --> 01:42:48,359
The one who should leave
here will be the one to.

1635
01:42:48,696 --> 01:42:50,416
Arrange for him to be
sent away immediately.

1636
01:42:50,477 --> 01:42:52,293
But where will he go?

1637
01:42:52,373 --> 01:42:54,377
- I don't know.
- Then how would I know?

1638
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:56,047
He'll stay where I do.

1639
01:42:56,127 --> 01:42:58,849
I married you. I'm
only responsible for you.

1640
01:42:58,929 --> 01:43:00,369
I didn't take on your child as well.

1641
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:03,785
Did you think I would kill
him once we were married..

1642
01:43:03,865 --> 01:43:06,199
Or leave him in
some marketplace to beg?

1643
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:07,525
I didn't know that
in getting married..

1644
01:43:07,549 --> 01:43:10,189
I was not settling down
but starting an orphanage.

1645
01:43:10,269 --> 01:43:13,339
- Prakash!
- Where I'd have to rear that vile man's child.

1646
01:43:14,571 --> 01:43:17,549
You haven't insulted him but me.

1647
01:43:18,004 --> 01:43:20,971
You've thrown into my
face that time of my life..

1648
01:43:21,051 --> 01:43:23,349
Which I wanted to forget.

1649
01:43:23,860 --> 01:43:28,029
If you wanted to revile my past,
why did you marry me?

1650
01:43:29,032 --> 01:43:33,443
I hadn't begged you to
marry me when I was a widow.

1651
01:43:34,005 --> 01:43:39,221
I had married for his sake,
for his future.

1652
01:43:39,301 --> 01:43:41,323
If that's the case, then decide.

1653
01:43:41,781 --> 01:43:43,372
Do you want your
son or your husband?

1654
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:50,448
Both. I'm a mother
as well as a wife.

1655
01:43:51,252 --> 01:43:54,063
It's not possible to go
through life straddling a fence.

1656
01:43:54,314 --> 01:43:56,182
You'll have to
choose one of the two.

1657
01:43:56,655 --> 01:43:57,735
I want an answer.

1658
01:43:57,972 --> 01:44:01,495
An answer! She won't
give you an answer, I will.

1659
01:44:01,821 --> 01:44:03,855
The one who brought
upheaval in the lives..

1660
01:44:03,935 --> 01:44:05,717
Of you both isn't this
child but this wretched woman.

1661
01:44:05,741 --> 01:44:07,317
If you want to throw
someone out, throw her.

1662
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:08,005
What did you say?

1663
01:44:08,085 --> 01:44:11,415
If you glare at me, I'll slap
you so hard you'll see double.

1664
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:14,638
- Chiman!
- Brother-in-law! I can yell too.

1665
01:44:14,941 --> 01:44:16,861
Instead of rebuking her,
you're encouraging her.

1666
01:44:16,941 --> 01:44:18,526
You allowed her to lead
you astray into throwing..

1667
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:19,805
That poor fatherless
boy out of the house?

1668
01:44:19,829 --> 01:44:21,773
I'm doing what I think is right.

1669
01:44:21,853 --> 01:44:23,567
If sister-in-law had
done what you're doing..

1670
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:26,231
Think what your son's
plight would have been now.

1671
01:44:26,311 --> 01:44:27,887
She came into this
house as a stepmother..

1672
01:44:27,911 --> 01:44:29,144
But loved him as her own son.

1673
01:44:29,168 --> 01:44:31,751
She doted on your child
and loved him as a mother.

1674
01:44:31,831 --> 01:44:33,831
But you couldn't think
of her son as yours!

1675
01:44:33,911 --> 01:44:35,853
Don't talk nonsense!
Get out of here!

1676
01:44:35,933 --> 01:44:38,440
Let alone here, I'll
be leaving this house.

1677
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,118
What's the good of
staying in a house..

1678
01:44:40,198 --> 01:44:41,831
Where there's no compassion?

1679
01:44:45,013 --> 01:44:46,163
Nonsense!

1680
01:45:00,183 --> 01:45:06,185
Mother, I'm going to grandpa.
Don't miss me.

1681
01:45:06,384 --> 01:45:10,604
I'll come back later. Then you
won't be quarrelling with dad.

1682
01:45:11,253 --> 01:45:14,133
He'll be happy. You be happy too.

1683
01:45:31,275 --> 01:45:32,875
- You?
- Where are you going?

1684
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,946
- To grandpa.
- To your grandpa? But where is he?

1685
01:45:36,214 --> 01:45:39,077
His address is in this letter.
All right, Brother.

1686
01:45:39,336 --> 01:45:40,573
Take care of mother.

1687
01:45:40,781 --> 01:45:42,341
Anil, I'll come along with you.

1688
01:45:42,421 --> 01:45:45,261
No. The fights happen because of me.

1689
01:45:45,571 --> 01:45:48,101
Both mother and dad love you.

1690
01:45:48,278 --> 01:45:51,608
But I love you. Wherever
we stay, we'll be together.

1691
01:45:51,688 --> 01:45:54,626
No, don't get into this mess.

1692
01:45:54,859 --> 01:45:57,073
No matter what, I
won't let you go alone.

1693
01:45:57,249 --> 01:45:59,249
Hadn't mother said that brothers..

1694
01:45:59,329 --> 01:46:00,688
Should support each other..

1695
01:46:00,768 --> 01:46:02,409
The way Lakshman
supported Lord Rama?

1696
01:46:03,492 --> 01:46:04,569
Come on.

1697
01:46:13,351 --> 01:46:21,351
"A mother sacrifices her
life for her children."

1698
01:46:24,865 --> 01:46:32,222
"Today, these children, for
the sake of their mother.."

1699
01:46:32,302 --> 01:46:38,121
"Have set out to
make the sacrifice."

1700
01:46:43,959 --> 01:46:51,042
"See this strange game of fate."

1701
01:46:52,242 --> 01:46:54,922
"See this strange game of fate."

1702
01:46:55,002 --> 01:46:57,762
"In this world full of thorns.."

1703
01:46:57,842 --> 01:47:01,762
"Two children have been
parted from their home.."

1704
01:47:01,842 --> 01:47:06,242
"And find themselves in a storm."

1705
01:47:06,565 --> 01:47:11,651
"See this strange game of fate."

1706
01:47:27,028 --> 01:47:32,482
"These innocent little kids.."

1707
01:47:32,675 --> 01:47:38,082
"What's their fault?"

1708
01:47:38,313 --> 01:47:46,313
"They don't know where
they'll stay, having left home."

1709
01:47:49,495 --> 01:47:53,395
"They don't know it."

1710
01:47:54,433 --> 01:48:02,433
"A parent's love denied,
thorns pricked at their smiles."

1711
01:48:05,762 --> 01:48:08,762
"Two children have been
parted from their home.."

1712
01:48:08,842 --> 01:48:11,576
"And find themselves in a storm."

1713
01:48:11,656 --> 01:48:14,262
"They find themselves in a storm."

1714
01:48:14,342 --> 01:48:19,617
"See this strange game of fate."

1715
01:48:34,726 --> 01:48:40,225
"They don't understand the way.."

1716
01:48:40,305 --> 01:48:45,728
"One is held dear and
the other an outsider."

1717
01:48:45,927 --> 01:48:51,516
"Elders may feel
ashamed at seeing.."

1718
01:48:51,596 --> 01:48:59,596
"The selfless love of these."

1719
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:10,160
"It's as if they're
of the same blood."

1720
01:49:13,609 --> 01:49:16,490
"Two children have been
parted from their home.."

1721
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:19,436
"And find themselves in a storm."

1722
01:49:19,516 --> 01:49:21,872
"They find themselves in a storm."

1723
01:49:21,952 --> 01:49:27,762
"In this world full of thorns.."

1724
01:49:27,842 --> 01:49:30,498
"Two children have been
parted from their home.."

1725
01:49:30,578 --> 01:49:35,860
"And find themselves in a storm."

1726
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:40,966
"See this strange game of fate."

1727
01:49:43,762 --> 01:49:46,899
- Sir, where's my grandpa?
- Who is your grandpa?

1728
01:49:46,979 --> 01:49:50,765
- Mr. Ratanlal.
- Mr. Ratanlal? He's not here.

1729
01:49:51,137 --> 01:49:53,265
He left by the morning
train to go visit his grandson.

1730
01:49:53,345 --> 01:49:55,177
- He left?
- Yes, Son.

1731
01:49:57,409 --> 01:49:58,524
What will happen now?

1732
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:00,130
What do I tell you, brother?

1733
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:04,526
Maybe even Lord is angry with us.

1734
01:50:19,645 --> 01:50:21,445
Mr. Ratanlal, you didn't leave?

1735
01:50:21,805 --> 01:50:23,812
I missed the morning train.
I'm leaving now.

1736
01:50:23,892 --> 01:50:29,018
- Father!
- You are here? Is all well?

1737
01:50:29,399 --> 01:50:30,879
Both children have
run away from home.

1738
01:50:31,034 --> 01:50:32,790
Run away? But why?

1739
01:50:38,307 --> 01:50:41,049
- Dad!
- What do we do?

1740
01:50:41,732 --> 01:50:43,462
Run. Or he'll thrash us.

1741
01:50:48,513 --> 01:50:50,624
Sunil! Sunil!

1742
01:50:50,797 --> 01:50:51,797
Wait!

1743
01:50:58,096 --> 01:50:59,791
Sunil, wait!

1744
01:51:06,402 --> 01:51:08,086
Sunil, wait!

1745
01:51:15,091 --> 01:51:17,082
Sunil, wait!

1746
01:51:25,444 --> 01:51:26,802
Sunil!

1747
01:52:06,014 --> 01:52:09,672
Sunil! Come back, Son!

1748
01:52:09,871 --> 01:52:12,223
I won't say anything
to you! Come back!

1749
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:17,134
Sunil!

1750
01:52:26,821 --> 01:52:29,511
Sunil! Come back!

1751
01:52:31,647 --> 01:52:35,400
- Dad!
- Dad!

1752
01:52:45,147 --> 01:52:49,195
- Dad!
- What happened? What will happen now?

1753
01:52:49,584 --> 01:52:54,765
Mother! Mother!

1754
01:52:59,582 --> 01:53:02,497
Save them! Save them somehow!

1755
01:53:07,061 --> 01:53:08,180
Mother!

1756
01:53:15,061 --> 01:53:16,141
Mother!

1757
01:53:16,577 --> 01:53:19,268
It'll be difficult for
them to survive now.

1758
01:53:20,176 --> 01:53:21,981
No! Oh, God!

1759
01:53:33,131 --> 01:53:34,421
Mother!

1760
01:53:44,295 --> 01:53:46,318
- Mother!
- Mother!

1761
01:53:51,661 --> 01:53:53,661
- Mother!
- Mother!

1762
01:53:57,935 --> 01:54:01,981
- Mother!
- Sunil!

1763
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,517
- Wait, Son! I'm coming!
- Sunil!

1764
01:54:06,852 --> 01:54:08,497
Let go of me! It's my son out there!

1765
01:54:08,577 --> 01:54:10,421
He'll drown! Let go of me!

1766
01:54:10,501 --> 01:54:13,421
If you go into that water,
you'll die as well.

1767
01:54:13,501 --> 01:54:14,581
No!

1768
01:54:29,785 --> 01:54:33,854
- Anil!
- Anil!

1769
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:38,821
Come back. Otherwise
you'll die too. Come back.

1770
01:54:38,901 --> 01:54:39,981
Come back!

1771
01:55:21,262 --> 01:55:22,940
What's the matter with him?

1772
01:55:23,631 --> 01:55:30,671
- My son.. Open your eyes, Son.
- What happened?

1773
01:55:34,070 --> 01:55:37,460
Anil! Anil! Open your eyes, Son.

1774
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:42,949
I've had nothing but loss in my life.
Don't give me more loss.

1775
01:55:43,029 --> 01:55:46,011
Anil, why are you silent?
Please say something.

1776
01:55:46,091 --> 01:55:49,006
Call me 'mother.' Anil..

1777
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:52,846
Say something, Son. Say something.

1778
01:55:52,926 --> 01:55:57,128
Say something. No!

1779
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:02,948
Anil, Son..

1780
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:11,667
He's still breathing. Pray. Anil..

1781
01:56:12,082 --> 01:56:18,336
Son, your grandpa is
calling out to you.

1782
01:56:19,088 --> 01:56:21,763
Say something, Son.

1783
01:56:21,985 --> 01:56:25,618
I won't be able to
survive your death.

1784
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:28,354
Say something, Son. Say something.

1785
01:56:29,233 --> 01:56:31,420
Say something, Son. Say something.

1786
01:56:33,185 --> 01:56:37,621
Say something, Son. Say something.

1787
01:56:40,977 --> 01:56:44,453
- Grandpa..
- Anil!

1788
01:56:46,425 --> 01:56:49,858
Anil! My son!

1789
01:56:53,222 --> 01:56:58,378
Grandpa, don't leave me now.
I'll stay with you.

1790
01:56:58,458 --> 01:57:02,832
Don't leave me now, grandpa.

1791
01:57:02,912 --> 01:57:05,747
No, Son. You won't
go with your grandpa..

1792
01:57:05,993 --> 01:57:09,232
But with your father. Come to me.

1793
01:57:09,847 --> 01:57:13,604
- Come. Come, Son.
- Dad!

1794
01:57:13,944 --> 01:57:17,255
Son, please forgive me.

1795
01:57:17,421 --> 01:57:21,182
I was misguided by others.
Please forgive me.

1796
01:57:23,615 --> 01:57:26,435
I wonder how many
children's lives are ruined..

1797
01:57:26,515 --> 01:57:29,502
Because of people like us.

1798
01:57:31,313 --> 01:57:35,758
That won't be the case now.
It won't.

1799
01:57:35,914 --> 01:57:37,695
Come with me. Come.
