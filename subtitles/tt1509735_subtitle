Rajam, 1975

2
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,335
Father, do you know them?
- Them?

3
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,330
No, I don't know.
- Then why didthey smile at you?

4
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,002
Smile isthe only language that
everyone understands in the world.

5
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,667
Father, always be with me

6
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,928
When you are there with
me everything looks happy.

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,534
Birds. Goats Farms
Our village. Everything.

8
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,271
To make sure everyone is happy...

9
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,279
...yourfatherwent to
live in the forests

10
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,405
I heard that the police
will kill you.

11
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,374
Who? Who said that?

12
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,782
My teacher saidthat.

13
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,319
You are agood person Why should
they kill you? - I am still alive

14
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,258
I feel like crying, father.
- You shouldn't cry.

15
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,387
Even when I am not there
you should be smiling.

16
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,265
Shall I tell you something?

17
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,731
If we live for ourselves
it's not a life worth living

18
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,667
If we die for others
that's alife worth living.

19
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,677
Shekhar. Don't move.

20
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,711
Shekhar.

21
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,665
Son what's your name?
- Bhagat.

22
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,332
Nice name.
- When did yourfather come?

23
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,273
Today.
- You know where yourfather lives?

24
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,677
In the forest. Why do
you want to kill my father?

25
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,442
Everyone says my
fatheris agood man

26
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,946
Look son, we don't kill
the innocents with these guns.

27
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,922
If yourfatherwas really
nice he should've livedwith us.

28
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,920
What'sthe needto run away?

29
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,008
Ranasthali, 1989

30
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,645
Greetings, brother.

31
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,253
Move aside. Move aside.

32
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,531
Father.
- Why did you come?

33
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,474
They will kill you
You are not needed here

34
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,710
Sadhu. Sadhu will
take care of everything.

35
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,847
Go. Go away from here. Go away.

36
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,980
They will kill you

37
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,259
Only because uncle is
here you are saying...

38
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,261
...he will take care of everything
He is your brother.

39
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,654
I am your son.

40
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,261
All this belongsto me. Only to me.

41
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,800
Your property. Your business.
Your life

42
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,929
Your chair.

43
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,273
Father, I could've killed
uncle even after your death...

44
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,403
...but youwouldn't
have known about it.

45
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,539
He carried you in his
arms when you were a kid.

46
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,315
We too have some ethics.

47
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,321
Remove that gunfirst.

48
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,277
Father, death is easy.

49
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,268
Your close your eyes and it's over.

50
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,405
But killing is very difficult.

51
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,257
Shakti, you made amistake.

52
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,721
You made abig mistake.

53
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,262
Uncle everyone in our
family alongwith father...

54
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,922
...are destined to go to hell.

55
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,261
If you know anyone in this world.

56
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,598
...who hasn't done any
mistake come here along with him

57
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,995
Till then don't come to me.

58
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,255
Sir, if the crows haven't
touched the holy offering yet...

59
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,655
...it means yourfather had
some unfulfilled wishes

60
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,854
Till his wish isn't fulfilled crows
won't touchthat holy offering.

61
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,724
Rod Mastan.

62
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,002
He is not ready for compromise.

63
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:53,272
Anji didn't listento you. He is
thinking of plansto kill you

64
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,280
And Mati Kumar? - He is the
one who asked Prabhakar to stop.

65
00:06:56,382 --> 00:07:00,785
He is going overboard. He said
he is giving you two days' time.

66
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,578
And that you
should run away by then.

67
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,315
Or else you should commit suicide.

68
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,315
I'mthe one who should say that.

69
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,986
Ok let's not wait further.

70
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,454
Let's finish the job.

71
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,331
Ourenemies' strength will
show people our strength.

72
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,536
Priest, do I have to offer
the holy offering to crows?

73
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,277
Can't I offer it to dogs?

74
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:16,250

"You shall never stop your

96
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,529
How long?
- Half an hour, sir.

97
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,728
You are saying the
same since one hour.

98
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,596
Mr. Murthy, there's a
minor change inthe program.

99
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,930
He should surrenderwith the weapon

100
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,334
Sorry, sir. It's not possible

101
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,271
Minister sir, I told you right
in the beginning...

102
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,274
...that he won't do all this.

103
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,279
What weapon?
- Chandrashekhar Panigrahi...

104
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,541
...notorious agitator. His
surrenderwill be agreat victory.

105
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,244
If he surrenders with the weapon.

106
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,908
...it will be a huge blow for
the naxals (agroup of rebels).

107
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,714
And he didn't agree forthat.
- But, sir...

108
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,718
That's all. The
risk factor is for us

109
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,324
We are in public life. Make it fast.

110
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,724
Ask him to come soon.
I want to leave.

111
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,723
Ok, sir.

112
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,333
Sir, he's coming.

113
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,588
Greetings
- Greetings.

114
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,258
Actually during my
student days I too worked...

115
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,664
...with agitators, I was
apart of the mission

116
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,266
The ministerwill
give you a check now.

117
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,797
For surrendering yourself.

118
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,667
There's no need forthat.

119
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,337
So from now onwards as
a responsible citizen...

120
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,278
I have been always a
responsible citizen.

121
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,247
I mean be apart of society...

122
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,579
I am part of the society.

123
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,989
Sir, why did you surrender?

124
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,257
Some are saying it's
because of your poor health.

125
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,265
Do you have any doubts
regardingthe mission?

126
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,662
You are a member of
the central committee

127
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,269
If you surrenderin this way...

128
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,804
There's no problem with my health.

129
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,940
I didn't accept the reward
the government offered me.

130
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,535
I have complete
faith in our mission.

131
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,877
I don't have any
differences with the party.

132
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,783
There's a retirement age
for everything in life

133
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,246
In the same way I left the mission...

134
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,447
...thinking that we should also
get retirement fromthis work.

135
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:26,915
Thank you.

136
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,252
Mr. Panigrahi, now that you
have surrendered yourself...

137
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,454
What will you do now?

138
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,265
Till now I lived in forests

139
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,336
From now on I will live with
people in society.

140
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,271
Listen, Bhagat. Bhagat. One minute...

141
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,277
Practicing to hone my singing
and running foryour health...

142
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,610
...just like that.
Ok tell me something.

143
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,577
A middleman came for
you some time ago.

144
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,250
You didn't get it? Middleman means.

145
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:01,258
...not someone young like you
and not an old man like me

146
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,261
Just like that. He said
he'll be right here. - Listen...

147
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,263
Coming Look for him

148
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,998
Bhagat, that guy's
name is Panigrahi.

149
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,717
Indian Express' Mr. Murthy
told me that you are in this city.

150
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:31,980
How are you father?

151
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,257
I jumped fromthe bridge that
day andfled. You remember it?

152
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,526
I am the same man And you?

153
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,657
I am fine, father.

154
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,594
I surrendered
myself yesterday itself.

155
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,945
Father, you want to have tea
coffee or something?

156
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,875
No formalities please
Offer anything you wish

157
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,399
Are you preparing for UPSC?

158
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,662
I am writing exams for a
job in civil service father.

159
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,667
The prelims are over. The
main exams are next month.

160
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,269
Collector?
- No, I want to be a police officer.

161
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,471
I don't want tea Give
me something to eat.

162
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,241
It is last night's rice father.
- It's alright.

163
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,249
I never saw a good
police officer in my life

164
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,721
Your motherwas also
killed by a police officer.

165
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,520
There's no goodness in policemen

166
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,269
Why are you smiling?
- That day police didn't intend...

167
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,270
...to kill mother, father.
And also, goodness can't be...

168
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,737
...seen on someone's face

169
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,735
Read the newspapers once.

170
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,276
Police atrocities
lock-up deaths molestations.

171
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,005
...can be seen all around.

172
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,381
That system has collapsed.
- That's your opinion, father.

173
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,248
Youthink it's not true?
- If what you say is true...

174
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,378
...then we have to first
change this very system, father.

175
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,583
That's why I want to
become apolice officer.

176
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,923
You are thinking in a goodway.

177
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,264
Be a good man even
after becoming a policeman

178
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,262
I am abit aggressive speaker.

179
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,268
I have been that way
right since the beginning

180
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,467
It will take me a couple
of daysto settle here.

181
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,005
You don't needto
settle anywhere, father.

182
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,250
I have adjusted with
my father a long ago.

183
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,337
It's an old habit inthe jungle.

184
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,382
Roaming all night and
sleeping in the morning.

185
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,241
You didn't go to your office?
- I kept looking at you.

186
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,578
Why?
- It's been along time.

187
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,589
Bhagat, I think there's
some guest at your home.

188
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,997
Just like that. Greetings,
sir. My name is Chirigiri Raju.

189
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,002
I stay in the nearby house
Just like that.

190
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,265
Instead of plain Chirigiri Raju if
you say musician Chirigiri Raju...

191
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,604
...they can identify me
I teach music.

192
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,609
Just like that. I
charge fee forthat though.

193
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,008
And you are.
- He is my son

194
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,979
Hey! Bhagat, you didn't tell
me that your father is coming

195
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,583
Did he even tell you
that his father is alive?

196
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,587
Come on! He doesn't
need to tell that.

197
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,249
And also, how can there be
music without basic notes...

198
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,258
...and how can there be
children without parents.

199
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,330
I thought you must be in
some job or business somewhere.

200
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,261
By the way what do
you do? Just like that.

201
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,924
My father is an ex-naxal.

202
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,268
O God!
- Sit down

203
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,270
I will sit here.
It's comfortable here.

204
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,879
Chandrashekhar Panigrahi...
- It's me.

205
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,578
Sir, I need your sign here
- What'sthat?

206
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,981
Residence proof, sir.
- What for?

207
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,309
It's part of the procedure, sir.

208
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,251
And the DSP has asked you to
meet him in the camp office...

209
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,257
...this evening. - Ask him to
come here I'm not coming.

210
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,452
I'll bring him there this evening.
- Ok, sir.

211
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,993
You talk to the police in such
a way? - They are also humans.

212
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,262
O God! Srimalli, you are
calling me? I'm coming

213
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:43,406
Sir, I teach soft music
lessons and lead a smooth life.

214
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,267
When I suddenly saw
a policeman here...

215
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,935
...in a khaki uniform
I was shocked abit.

216
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,343
I am a bit scared of policemen
just like that.

217
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,580
My boy wantsto become a policeman.

218
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,776
Coming

219
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,251
O God!

220
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,258
That's good entertainment.

221
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,931
Excuse me! You
have got some problem?

222
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,661
You are sitting here since morning.

223
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,247
If you are waitingfor someone.

224
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,371
...then you will have to stay
here till tomorrow morning.

225
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,717
Have you eaten
anything since morning?

226
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,535
I got married last night.

227
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:06,375
I was given away inthe morning.

228
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,214
A fellow villager
uncle Amrutam said...

229
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,250
...he will arrange
forthe dowry amount...

230
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,422
...but he couldn't...

231
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,853
Chutney.

232
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,997
Father sent me with them and
said he will bring the money.

233
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,467
He didn't come.

234
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,853
Father-in-law scolded me abit
and mother-in-law scolded alot.

235
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:52,395
Oh! It's so hot.

236
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,306
Pickle.

237
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,718
They bought me aticket to
our village and left me here

238
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,717
They said I can come back
only ifl bring the money.

239
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:29,790
Father said he will come...
He couldn't have stayed back.

240
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:32,863
But he didn't come.

241
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,409
Till you talked to
me I was a bit afraid.

242
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,277
Now I am hungry.

243
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,730
Is Mr. Subramaniam Sharma there?
- Who are you?

244
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,865
I am talking from Ranasthali.

245
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,996
He passed away at 3 pmtoday.

246
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,668
Mother, Subbalakshmi is here
Come in. Come in, sir.

247
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,977
Who is he?
- Where is brother-in-law?

248
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,517
Let us talk about money first.

249
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,251
Why don't you ask about it?
- I thought you would ask about it.

250
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,254
As my wife said has
the money been arranged.

251
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,585
You go inside.

252
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,797
I need to tell you
something more important.

253
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,594
I think he will give
us post-dated checks

254
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,934
Post-dated checks won't do.
Let me make that clear.

255
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,871
Her father passed away
this morning itself.

256
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,802
She doesn't know about it yet.

257
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:24,580
O God! You stepped into the
house without telling usthat?

258
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,583
This house is like a temple for us

259
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,243
No, dear... He is our son's
father-in-law afterall...

260
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,913
Father-in-law! My foot!
You too go and die there.

261
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,250
You should be ashamed to say that.

262
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,382
You call him your son's
father-in-law after such abetrayal?

263
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,252
Look, yourdaughter-In-law was
alone at the railway station...

264
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,265
...and I brought her here.
- How could she come here...

265
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,666
...alongwith a stranger? Hey,
call that evil girl outside first.

266
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,601
She may be afool,
but you are not right?

267
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,264
Why were you the only one
who was so concerned about her...

268
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,398
...in the railway station?

269
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,268
I would've also done the same
if your husband had left you...

270
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,539
...and youwere alone
at the railway station.

271
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,908
Ok, hats offto you
and your good manners

272
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,247
If you wish you can take
that misfortune to your home

273
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,252
Don't come to our house again.

274
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,919
Why are you still standing here?

275
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,926
Go and bring basil
leaves and turmeric water.

276
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,325
We need to cleanse the house.

277
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,794
What amisfortune!
What amisfortune!

278
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,606
That's what happens if the
wedding takes place at...

279
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:02,941
...an inauspicious time, son.

280
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,246
Or how would you explain her father's
death onthe wedding day itself.

281
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,250
Poor man! He faced
hardships all his life.

282
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,249
The grieving father had a
heart attack while talking to us.

283
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,381
...about the hardships
in his daughter's life

284
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,390
Only death could
relieve him of his grief.

285
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,522
This house is also mortgaged.

286
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,264
I wonder what that
person will demand tomorrow.

287
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,934
Look son, she has no one with her.

288
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,672
There her husband left her.
Here her father passed away.

289
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,277
She doesn't even have
a house now. Poorgirl.

290
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,876
I wonder how she will
live in the house now.

291
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,641
Even if I wish I am not
in a position to help her.

292
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,784
I don't have the
courage to face my wife.

293
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,843
I have two daughters, son

294
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,248
As a school teacher I could
only teach this girl. That's all.

295
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,737
You have got no one here.
Not eventhis house.

296
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,278
I am going back to
my village tomorrow.

297
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,440
I am unable to leave you alone here.

298
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,845
When we don't have anyone we
should live for ourselves

299
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,258
If you want to live
you can come with me.

300
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,329
"The temple bell is ringing."

301
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,804
"Something good
will come out of it."

302
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:40,810
"My heart is assuring me ofthis"

303
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,479
"I will think the Gods I pray..."

304
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,980
"...have blessed me today."

305
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,846
"The path adorned with
flowers is inviting me."

306
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:56,259
"I will go where it leads me to."

307
00:29:56,361 --> 00:30:01,321
"The sky will be the
roof overmy head."

308
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:06,333
"I am filled with optimism"

309
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:11,598
"I don't have any worries at all."

310
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:16,737
"There's no negativity around me"

311
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:19,248
"The temple bell is ringing."

312
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,647
"Something good
will come out of it."

313
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:26,721
"My heart is assuring me ofthis"

314
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:31,986
"My heart is assuring me ofthis"

315
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,252
Do you eat onthe floor?

316
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,258
He will come after
he's done with it.

317
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,795
Who are you? (What's your caste?)

318
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,542
The same question since
last 300 years Who are you?

319
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,249
We are Brahmins. Do you eat meat?
- Not now.

320
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,783
Do I have to eat inthis plate?
- I washed it.

321
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,319
But still you must've
eaten meat in it at some point.

322
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,527
This is a new plate.
We didn't use it yet.

323
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,727
O God! You don't take
abath after shaving?

324
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:48,462
I am a man

325
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,271
Oh no! What'sthat!

326
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,809
So that they would
boil with the rice.

327
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,582
Egg is vegetarian food,
just like spinach.

328
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,578
Does ababy spinach
come out of spinach?

329
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,252
What's your name girl?
- Tallavajala Tripura.

330
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:07,313
...Bhramarambika Lalita Surya
Sudhakara Sundara Subbalaxmi.

331
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,854
In short they call me
TTBL triple S Subbalaxmi.

332
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:16,857
Can you cook?

333
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:31,848
"The one who lead
me to this place."

334
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:37,252
"I see my foot steps
in his footmarks"

335
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:42,258
"I am blindly following him."

336
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,662
"I am blindly following my heart."

337
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:52,992
"I had no one to fall back upon..."

338
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:57,468
"There were tears in my eyes"

339
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:02,672
"There was no home there
was no roof over my head."

340
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:08,309
"I am fortunate to get
a new lease of life"

341
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,255
"The temple bell is ringing."

342
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,655
"Something good
will come out of it."

343
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:19,525
"My heart is assuring me of this"

344
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:24,502
"My heart is assuring me of this"

345
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:24,991
"My heart is assuring me of this"

346
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,257
Greetings, Mr. DSP.
Shakti will surrender himself.

347
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,992
You arrest him I will get the bail.

348
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,920
Are you a lawyer or ajoker?

349
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,258
There can't be any
compromise between him and me.

350
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,448
This is your pending warrant.

351
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,258
Tomorrow it is Friday.
The courts are closed.

352
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,520
...on Saturday and Sunday.

353
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,259
You have seen police
lock-up before, right?

354
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,264
Does anyone trust apoliceman?

355
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,270
I too don't like compromises

356
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,245
I have shown death to many people.

357
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,652
If it rains you will die in an hour.

358
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,390
If it doesn't youwill
die in half an hour.

359
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,241
Sorry, sir, I am late
- What were you doing till now?

360
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:20,249
Sir. - You are ten minutes late.
- The jeep...

361
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,716
You must come here running
Sit down.

362
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,456
Well, this is not our
regular Tri-meeting.

363
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,258
I am about to arrest Shakti
at exactly 7:30this evening.

364
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:43,273
Whoever heard this can't
leave this place till 7 pmtoday.

365
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,001
You will be staying
here all day long.

366
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,371
Don't care for anyone

367
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,444
Thrash anyone who comes on yourway.

368
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,922
Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

369
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,655
Sir.
- Yes, what's your doubt?

370
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,784
If we take on Shakti's
men without a warrant...

371
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:04,919
What warrant?

372
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,521
Youwant warrant?

373
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,999
Youwant warrant?

374
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,263
Idiot. Youtake money from
him and create a scene here?

375
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,669
You. How much you took from him?
- Sir.

376
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:19,265
Come on, tell me how much
- Sir...

377
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,540
You are always by my side

378
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,847
Even if you go for pee you
stay by my side Now sit down.

379
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,251
We will together raid
them at exactly 7:30.

380
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,518
So please, all of
you check your watches.

381
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,455
Now the time is 3.
Well, now the plan is...

382
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,521
...according to the
available information...

383
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,727
What? I heard you are
going abit overboard.

384
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,934
That you were planning a
raid on me at exactly 7:30 pm?

385
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:29,479
Hey, what'sthe time now?
- It's 7 O' clock

386
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,712
I heardthat you hit
the CI in tri-meeting

387
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,584
Bars Restaurants You
will seize everything?

388
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,451
You will put me in the lock-up?

389
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,582
The previous DSP also
said the same thing.

390
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,383
How many people do I have to kill?

391
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,321
You know something,
Venkateshwar Rao.

392
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,594
14 murders. 11 kidnaps.

393
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,665
8 raids. Robberies and ransoms.

394
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,272
Escaped on bail fourtimes.
What happenedto me now?

395
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:00,333
Nothing. What will happen
if I kill your children now?

396
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,316
It'll be difficult for you to
have two more kids now, right?

397
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,252
Why such aggression?
Do you really need it?

398
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,991
Every village needs apoliceman

399
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,325
Every street needs a dog.

400
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,727
Dog isthere forthe street.
The street is not forthe dog

401
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:24,266
The street dog should bark
when we ask it to bark.

402
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,995
...and stop when we do this.

403
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,665
Your kids will reach
home in half an hour.

404
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,537
You must remember me
whenever yourkids breath.

405
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,939
If you make amistake
they will stop breathing.

406
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,273
Remember it.

407
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,386
And yes, why didn't
you come into the temple?

408
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:46,780
I am not habituated to it.

409
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,254
O God! He will take away your eyes

410
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,454
I still have mine.
- You don't believe in God?

411
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,463
Do you believe in Allah and Jesus?

412
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,266
If a person gains
or loses something...

413
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,996
...it's because of
another person. Remember it.

414
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,243
Switch it off.

415
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,330
I never saw you before.

416
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,329
I came here before you
were transferred here

417
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,269
I tried many times to meet you

418
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,341
I gave up those things long ago.

419
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,343
I am somehow getting by here.

420
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,245
If you could
co-operate in some way...

421
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,372
...we can do something about Shakti.

422
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,916
I don't have the energy to laugh.

423
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,452
He is my brother's son. I
brought him up with these hands

424
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,791
How can I have any
vengeance against him?

425
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,654
If this is what is in your
mind do not come here again

426
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:01,789
Goodbye.

427
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,328
'DSP Sir... '

428
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,398
One second.

429
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,309
I don't know who is
Shakti's man in my gang

430
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,244
I take every step cautiously.

431
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,324
We are not strong
enough to kill Shakti.

432
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,319
We needthe right man forthat.

433
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,922
I am waiting forhim sir.

434
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,441
What happened?

435
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,710
Did anyone say
anything in the class?

436
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,987
Did you fail some test?

437
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,259
Then?

438
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,725
What is it? Why are you barging in?

439
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,260
Stop there. - Call your son.
- My son's not there at home

440
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,262
Veda Murthy, look
there's someone for you.

441
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,927
What's the matter, father?

442
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:56,277
Where are you going? You
would hit my kid orwhat?

443
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,318
What's this?
- I think it's some letter.

444
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,645
Your son wrote it.

445
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,323
'Dear Subbalakshmi, I
need to talk to you.'

446
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,724
'Come room no. 102 in
hotel Priyain city centre.'

447
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,660
What has he written?
- Something unspeakable.

448
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:14,855
What'sthis?

449
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,664
It's not my son's handwriting.
He hasn't written it.

450
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,000
It's his handwriting.
- Will you please stay quiet?

451
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,941
And what'sthe
guaranty that my son wrote it?

452
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,475
You barge into
respected people's home.

453
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,273
Respected people don't ask
women to come to hotels.

454
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,249
Look, I am telling you
this forthe last time.

455
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,991
That girl is your wife It's not
wrong if you want to talk to her.

456
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,322
But first bring herto your
home and then talk to her.

457
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,521
Forthe time being
I am herguardian

458
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,859
What are you saying! I can't
even write a letter to my wife?

459
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:59,465
Subbalakshmi, you want to
talk to him about anything?

460
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,870
What's there to talk?

461
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:07,381
I thought you are agood person.
It's my mistake.

462
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,244
I thought you were taking
me to some other place...

463
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:16,258
...but you brought me
here and create a scene?

464
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:22,991
I lost my father as well.

465
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,463
I thought you are everything for me

466
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,244
Just because this is
there around my neck...

467
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,576
...you brought me here right?

468
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,252
I didn't know how to remove it.

469
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,003
Subbalakshmi.

470
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,775
I thought you were
taking me to some other place.

471
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,374
I didn't mean to hurt you.

472
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:17,650
I thought if you talk to them
once. - I won't talk to you.

473
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,580
Sorry. I made a mistake.

474
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,258
I am everything for you, right?

475
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,601
Actually... I mean.

476
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,597
I...

477
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,006
Rickshaw.
- No.

478
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,243
Don't call the rickshaw.

479
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,242
"The temple bell is ringing."

480
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,652
"Something good
will come out of it."

481
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:57,455
"My heart is assuring me ofthis"

482
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:03,331
"My heart is assuring me ofthis"

483
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,762
"I got ahelping hand from God."

484
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:45,932
"There were hurdles, but I
reached my destination."

485
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:50,974
"I couldn't dare to
dream at one point of time."

486
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:56,241
"Now I don't suffer
from Ioneliness anymore."

487
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,923
"My world has become beautiful."

488
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:06,587
"One can't even
dream of such fortune."

489
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:11,600
"This friendship has become
my most prized possession"

490
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:16,765
"I amthe luckiest person on earth."

491
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,267
"The temple bell is ringing."

492
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,539
"Something good
will come out of it."

493
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:27,981
"My heart is assuring me ofthis"

494
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:34,313
"My heart is assuring me ofthis"

495
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,788
Hey, it will kill you

496
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,665
I wish I had died.

497
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:50,272
No, I will die only after
I take revenge from him.

498
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,274
Hey, you are going overboard.

499
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,809
It won't look good
while talking to brother.

500
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:57,312
I won't talk to brother.
I will just cry.

501
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,712
You will tell everything to brother.

502
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:04,245
He took my wife along on his bike.

503
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:12,924
I thought she will come to the lodge
and she came with him Damn her!

504
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,796
Hey, stop it! Enough. Put it down.

505
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,268
It's over.
- How much did you drink?

506
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,338
I have been drinking
since last evening

507
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,003
It won't be wrong
even if you kill her.

508
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:28,802
Brother is calling you.

509
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:37,713
Bye.
- Greetings brother. - What is it?

510
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,323
Stand here
- Greetings, brother.

511

He's my friend brother.
- Sit down

512
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,794
Brother. Brother.
- I will talk to him.

513
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,592
Who is he?
- That's not the thing, brother.

514
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,257
Actually what
happened is that, brother...

515
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,665
...they meted out
great injustice to me.

516
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,268
Only you can save me brother.

517
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:57,999
They did injustice to me, brother.
- Hey, tell me clearly.

518
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,740
Only you can save me brother.

519
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:02,277
Someone took away his wife.
- Yes, brother.

520
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,903
He got married?
- Yes, brother.

521
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,379
Who took her away?
- If you could give him a warning...

522
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,255
What's your interest in it?
- He's been my friend...

523
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,256
...since childhood.
- You think you can sleep with her...

524
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,326
...if he gets drunk and passes out?
- Brother, it's.

525
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:17,651
Am I right?

526
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,459
How does she look?
- Damn good, brother.

527
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,657
I haven't done
anythingto her, brother.

528
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,530
In fact he took her away.
Please do something brother.

529
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,533
Please.
- What shall I do?

530
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:28,730
Whatever you wish brother.

531
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,805
She has no one in this world.
She lost her father as well.

532
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,407
Please do something, brother.

533
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,241
Does she really look good?
- She's damn hot, brother.

534
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,385
Trust me brother.
Please do something brother.

535
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:49,256
"My hero will come today..." - Stop,
brother. Stop. - "He will come."

536
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,383
This is his house brother.

537
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,870
Where is Bhagat?
- Ask him brother.

538
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,600
The next house, sir. Srimalli,
I'm coming.

539
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,910
Bhagat.
- It's me.

540
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:25,261
Ask him, brother.
- Hey, I heard you are.

00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,388
...keeping others' wives at your
home -Ask him, brother. Keep it up

542
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,460
Who are you?

543
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,919
Wow! You are
having a very good time.

544
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,249
Who are you?
- Is she exclusively for you.

545
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,517
...or you run some business
as well through her? - Good.

546
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,251
Hey, how dare you! Who are you?

547
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,726
Mind your language...
- You idiot.

548
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,853
Father.

549
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,263
You stay back I will handle it

550
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,267
So what did you say?
- Is she exclusively for you.

551
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,271
O God! He will kill us

552
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:16,676
He will kill us. He will kill us
God will destroy you.

553
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,384
I heard that afew days
ago DSP and uncle met up.

554
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:08,987
Uncle didn't agree
- Tell Sahu to closely watch uncle.

555
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,997
What happened? - I fell last night.
- Why drink so much?

556
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,733
It will take me three days for
me to return from Hyderabad.

557
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,672
Take care of everything. Be careful.

558
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:31,978
Who thrashed you?

559
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:34,788
I will kill him.

560
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:39,928
Were you busy while
he was thrashing you?

561
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,664
I was drunk. I will kill him today.

562
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,927
Don't leave the job midway.

563
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,537
Spinach leaves for one rupee
- Ok.

564
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:57,704
Curry leaves.
- You go home with all these things

565
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,975
I am getting late.

566
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,309
So?

567
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,256
I will also come to the station.
- Why?

568
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:13,260
At home there's
only upma That's all.

569
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,721
What do you want then?

570
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,734
Why don't you buy me
an Attu at the station?

571
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:27,309
The chutney tastes very good there.
- You know why?

572
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,538
Because men prepare it?

573
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,246
No. Because we pay for it.

574
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:48,423
You read till late hours every
night foryour exams right?

575
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,263

Then why be apoliceman?
You can become a collector.

579
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:08,273
Why? - If you become a
collector you can wear a coat.

580
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,653
If I become a
policeman I can thrash...

581
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:13,984
...guys like Veera
Murthy who abandoned you.

582
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,259

He gives wrong accounts every time.

00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:17,310
Will he kill him right here?

588
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,986

589
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:32,992

Sahu.

596
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,323
Sahu is dead.

597
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:36,332
"It's a chapter in history
which repeats again and again."

598
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:41,270
"The battle between good and evil
takes place in every generation"

599
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:46,267
"You have to pick the
weapon for the fight today."

600
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:52,305
"Your courage is
your biggest weapon."

601
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:57,381
"This is the biggest
battle of yourlife."

602
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,989
'When every place turns
into a battleground for you."

603
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,928
"...you have to pick yourweapon."

604
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,254
I'm the one who thrashed them all.

605
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,986
And you killed one
of them Sahu is dead

606
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,729
Because of his drinking habit...

607
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,321
...his liver has been
considerably damaged

608
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:27,258
On being hit right there he
had aliver failure and died.

609
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,273
Where will I get him?
- He surrendered himself.

610
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,006
He is in the police
station right now.

611
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,313
I didn't like it. I didn't.

612
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,251
Visiting the bar everyday.

613
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,256
Silly fights. Women

614
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,252
I didn't like it If agoon
appears on road everyday...

615
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,852
...people won't take him as a joke.

616
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,302
He must appear only once in a while.

617
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,907
All this happened because of me

618
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:07,567
Everyone is hurt by me!

619
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,135
You are no way related to this!

620
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:12,438
Nothing will happen to him dear.

621
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:17,779
I talked to the lawyer. We can
plead your case in the court.

622
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:22,688
You wanted to be a police
officer and now you are here in jail...

623
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,257
Had I become a
police officer by now...

624
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,692
...I would've had
everyone's responsibility.

625
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,322
I am your guardian.

626
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,324
You are staying with me.

627
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,732
I did what I should've done

628
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,271
I can defend myself in the
court without wearing the uniform.

629
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:43,803
Don't be afraid.

630
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,647
Father, there's some
money in my saving-account.

631
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:48,908
There's no such problem.

632
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,248
I will take care ofit.

633
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,890
Father, take care of Subbalakshmi.

634
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:11,273
What will happen now?
- What else?

635
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:14,276
The police will file a case
and send it to the court...

636
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,504
...andthen the case
will be triedthere

637
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,684
These ladyfingers are not raw
at all... - They are raw, madam.

638
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,254
I will give youthe raw ones,
madam. The raw ones...

639
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,482
Ok, give me...
- Ok, madam

640
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:34,261
And then... - Andthen bails,
trails, the case will be cancelled.

641
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,859
And also, he thrashed
them for self-defense.

642
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:40,993
There's no case at all.

643
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:43,262
This is not right. Come

644
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,539
Give me a tea
- Ok, sir.

645
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:52,705
Is it that easy?

646
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,844
If we are strong
here anything is easy.

647
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:01,983
Bhagat killed agoon
There can't be a case forthat.

648
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,656
Wait aminute I am coming. Come.

649
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,331
And if you get punished
for killing aperson...

650
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,463
...then how much should
I be punished? - Oh!

651
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:14,994
Take it.

652
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,638
Spinach leaves. Six bundles.
You gave only five

653
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,943

How much is it? - It's alright,
sir. No need to pay forit.

655

Why so?

01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,256
It's alright?
- It's alright sir.

01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,251
And what about you?
- It's alright sir.

658

You are insulting us with fear.

You are equating my son into a goon

664
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,275
Not him, but you guys
should be thrashed first.

665
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,903

thrashed till you lose fear.

We have a common enemy. Shakti.

676

I have got no enemies

He grew up infront of me.

681
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,467
I don't have the courage
to look into his eyes.

682
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,273
To fulfill your dream of
becoming apoliceman...

683
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:36,811
...you should first stay alive

684
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:37,968
I am still alive

685
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,245
Even if I am about to lose my life.

686
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,285
...I won't like to
meet you even then.

687
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:47,980
Fine.

688
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,261
I liked your attitude even
when you are inthe jail.

689
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:55,257
We will definitely
meet again. Goodbye.

690
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,268
The guys who got thrashed
when Sahu diedthe other day...

691
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,271
...have been
discharged from the hospital...

692
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,533
...and came to meet you.

693
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:07,870
They want to work foryou again.

694
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:12,414
We pay them to thrash people
Not to get thrashed.

695
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,873
From now onwardsthey
are not Shakti's men.

696
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,252
I want winning horses
not lame ones.

697
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,251
Whoever he is... I don't
even remember his name.

698
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:26,694
He actually did me a favor.
He showed me my weaknesses

699
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,266
Work in some cinema
hall or in some lodge.

700
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:35,268
We may be lame horses, sir.
But the one who thrashed us...

701
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:38,272
...is not a person whose
name you can affordto forget.

702
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:39,999
He killed Sahu.

703
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,469
We are having his nightmares.

704
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,506
You may also have his
nightmares very soon.

705
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,631
I need to talk to him personally.

706
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:06,759
Ok sir.

707
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,498
This is your hall ticket.

708
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,334
The day after
tomorrow it the main exam

709
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:17,902
I'm sorry.

710
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:20,673
I am not sorry, sir.

711
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,246
I think officers like you
shouldn't be in a position.

712
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,376
...to say sorry.

713
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:28,981
Ourjob is very constrained

714
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,324
We have to work for so
many hours everyday...

715
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,621
Shifts. Transfers.

716
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,324
Except obeying orders we can't.

717
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:41,003
In this condition it's of no
use for you to attend the exam.

718
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:42,928
Yours is amurder case.

719
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,269
If every police officer
obeys his conscience.

720
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:47,342
...we don't need jails or
courts in this country, sir.

721
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:49,603
I thrashed agoon

722
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:51,770
He died.

723
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,242
I don't think how I was yesterday.

724
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,581
I won't think what
I will be tomorrow.

725
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,780
What I am today is
what I think about.

726
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,316
Thank you, sir.

727
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:20,668
My men will send the bid.

728
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:25,573
Ask your sirto seal everything.
Tell him I okayed it.

729
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:30,251
Taking up contracts and
then roaming in Hyderabad...

730
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:32,253
...is not ourbusiness.
- So youwant me to work.

731
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,847
...for commissions and live
like agoon all my life?

732
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,950
Commission is a small part of it.

733
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,627
If we get the contract itself
the whole profit will be ours

734
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,268
In another 10-20
years there won't be...

735
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:47,996
...rowdies or goons anymore

736
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,896
Everyone will become a
politician and stay in Delhi.

737
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,398
Ourfuture is also the same.

738
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,467
We have to submit
the bid before 11:30.

739
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,542
We are crossing the 10 million
mark forthe first time in life.

740
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:00,639
Be careful.

741
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,391
Hey, we are getting late

742
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,930
Stop it if there is any vehicle
- Ok.

743
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:22,661
Stop that vehicle.

744
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,975
We need the jeep urgently.
Get downfast

745
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,541
You know who you are talking to?

746
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,849
Do you know who you are talking to?

747
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:38,784
Hey, get down.
- Hey, everyone get down

748
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:39,912
Get them down.

749
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,856
Brother, he's the
one who killed Sahu.

750
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:53,892
Where are you heading?

751
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,335
We are taking him to write his exam.

752
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,907
What exam?
- Civils.

753
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:04,912
What does that mean?
- IPS. Indian Police Service.

754
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,371
You want to become a policeman...

755
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:07,972
...after killing my man?

756
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:43,976
Don't do anythingto it.

757
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,329
Sir, he is alone there inside.

758
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:59,528
I am not worried about him,
but I am worried about them

759
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,243
If have to take your permission
as well to write the exam...

760
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,649
...I will defiinitely take it

761
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:41,667
O God!

762
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:46,872
"It's a chapter in history
which repeats again and again."

763
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:51,716
"The battle between good and evil
takes place in every generation"

764
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:56,654
"You have to pick the
weapon forthe fight today."

765
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:02,594
"Your courage is
yourbiggest weapon."

766
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:07,725
"This is the biggest
battle of yourlife."

767
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:12,430
'When every place turns
into a battleground for you."

768
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:17,311
"...you have to pick yourweapon."

769
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,653
Just one guy?

770
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,331
Did you count how many you were?

771
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:19,995
You turned out to be
one worthless fellows.

772
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,303
Wiithdraw Sahu's murdercase.

773
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,332
Tell them he died
in a train accident.

774
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,510
Let him off.

775
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:46,818
Nothing can go wrong.

776
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:50,989
As they withdrew the case.

777
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:55,730
...shall we go to some
other place for a few days...

778
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,599
You taught me what life is
when I was akid, father.

779
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,503
You didn't teach me fear.
I don't want to run away.

780
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,671
No, I mean if
something happens to you.

781
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:07,806
Nothing will happen to me, father.

782
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,816
We don't cancel our journeys
with the fear of accidents right?

783
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,514
Be aware

784
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,860
You can take your seat.
- Thank you, sir.

785
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,923
So you are Mr. Bhagat Panigrahi?
- Yes, sir.

786
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,397

Panigrahi yourfather? - Yes, sir.

787
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,895
I am his son.
- What he used to do?

788
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,804
He was anaxalite.
- You mean aterrorist in disguise?

789
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,274
If my father was a police
officer he would've been...

790
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:39,313
...been one of the top five
police officers in our country.

791
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:43,312
He is a very good human being, but...

792
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,245
...he doesn't have the
official seal for what he does.

793
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,916
...like a policeman in uniform has

794
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:52,483
I want to be a policeman
forthat particularseal.

795
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:02,733
What if you qualify for IAS?
- I will choose IPS.

796
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:04,532
Are you sure?
- I am sure, sir.

Mr. Bhagat Panigrahi,
according to you what is...

798
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,778
...that most important quality
that a police officer should have?

799
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,313
He should be able to love people.

800
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:52,980
The interview is over.
Next it'straining.

801
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,826
And then?

802
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,858

803
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:05,424
How much would be the salary?

804
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:09,336
15.

places Where will you stay?

807

They will provide accommodation.

808
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:20,709
There are separate
quarters for police officers.

809
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,644
The electricity?
- We should pay for it.

810
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,983
Will it abig house?
- There will be many rooms.

811
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:28,988

You don't like me?

816
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,394
I...

817
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:20,665
I am already married.
- That's not a marriage.

818
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:23,808
People will make fun of you.

819
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,609
That you married an
already-married girl.

820
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,307
I care a damn about it.

821
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:36,256
Yourfather...
- You too know...

822
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,758
...that he is a
better person than I am.

823
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:43,759
Lakshmi, tell me if you
want to marry me or not.

824
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,692
Your opinion is the only
thing that is important to me

01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,336
Yes, I like you. I
like you very much

826
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,699
But... - What? You don't
like me enoughto marry me?

827
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,468
Who will marry me if you won't?

828
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,739
What do you lack?

829
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,942
You are abig police officer.

830
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:08,982
And the girl will not even
have mother-in-law'strouble.

831
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:12,724
But I think I am not
that fortunate - But I am.

832
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:14,860
I am fortunate
enough to marry you.

833
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,524
"Have I said anything in my heart?"

834
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,997
"Have I said
anything subconsciously?"

835
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:26,000
"May be I have said something."

836
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,866
"May be you heard it."

837
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,241
"I will ask you what you heard."

"I will learnfrom
you what you heard"

thoughts I amthinking?"

840

"The heart is mine"

841
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:50,995
"The thoughts are yours"

842
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:56,429
"What sort of magic is this?"

843
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:03,736
"Have I said anything in my heart?"

844
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,904
"Have I said
anything subconsciously?"

845
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:11,281

"I am in a strange dilemma"

850
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:52,321
"Let me bide the time for a while."

851
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:57,330
"Let there be no
curtain between us."

852
01:18:57,632 --> 01:19:01,864
"Let us become one."

853
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:06,532
"My heart is
filled with your image"

854
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:11,745
"I have fallen in love
for the first time."

855
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:16,409
"The heart is mine"

856
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:21,521
"The thoughts are yours"

857
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:26,760
"What sort of magic is this?"

858
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,796
"Have I said anything in my heart?"

859
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:31,330
"Have I said
anything subconsciously?"

860
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:36,461
"May be I have said something."

861
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:38,766
"May be you heard it."

862
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,304
"I will ask you what you heard."

863
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:46,512
"I will learn from
you what you heard"

864
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:10,929
"I got God as a boon."

865
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:15,935
"He became a part ofme"

866
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:20,906
"He has got a spotless heart."

867
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:25,649
"He has got purest ofthe hearts."

868
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:30,248
"The moments I spend with you..."

869
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:35,421
"...stretch into life times"

870
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:39,990
"We are the witnesses
of our relationship."

871
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:45,334
"Ourwords are ediators"

872
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:50,344
"Our love isthe bond."

873
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,471
"Have I said anything in my heart?"

874
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:54,975
"Have I said
anything subconsciously?"

875
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:59,977
"May be I have said something."

876
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,619
"May be you heard it."

877
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:05,119
"I will ask you what you heard."

878
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:10,388
"I will ask you what you heard."

879
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,553
Come outside. We need
you forten minutes

880
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:22,928
My name is Shakti. Shakti Patnaik.

881
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:25,490
Sahu was my man.

882
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:28,397
I don't want to turn you
into ahero for no reason

883
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:29,731
Someone else will take his place

884
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:33,539
But you thrashed my men again.

885
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,008
Then I started
thinking about you again.

886
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,405
This time the loss
was 10 million rupees

887
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,373
This is ajungle.

888
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:44,951
And there's only one hunter in it.

889
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:47,813
The animals are
terribly scared of him.

890
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:52,320
One day alion fell in his cage

891
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:56,261
The hunter thought... The
other animals must be thinking...

892
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:59,424
...he can't harm him as it is alion

893
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:04,405
So the hunter must kill the
lion immediately. He left him

894
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,275
lf he kills alion
trapped in a cage.

895
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:09,400
...everyone would think
the hunter is a coward.

896
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:11,973
That's why I let you offthe jail.

897
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:14,812
I knew it when you
were writing the exam

898
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,317
I knew it when you were
going to the interview.

899
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,311
I also know that you are
going for you training today.

900
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:24,654
That's why I waited for this day.

901
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,984
Your father...

902
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:57,753
Death is easy.

903
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,257
All it needs is to close your eyes.

904
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:04,522
Killing is very difficult.

905
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:08,664
You can't die, but at the
same time you can't also live.

906
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,288
Recovery is fast, the doctor said.

907
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,520
But you are safe only as
long as you don't recover.

908
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:35,688
Shakti won't leave

909
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,929
Should he stay in the hospital
all his life due to Shakti's fear?

910
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,601
Some people are ready to help you.

911
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:50,635
I convinced them
with great difficulty.

912
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:55,276
His name is Sadhu Patnaik.
Shakti's own uncle.

913
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:59,976
Shakti is as big a threat
for him as he is for you.

914
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:05,682
I have aplan, but I
don't have someone like you.

915
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:06,987
If we join hands...

916
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:13,331
Thanks for coming
here without uniform

917
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,992
I have great respect forthat.

918
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:18,966
Where did you get this idiot?

919
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:22,337
If Shakti dies he will
turn into another Shakti.

920
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,571
You ran away from the circumstances.

921
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:29,241
Shakti has broken my body...

922
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,319
...but not my courage.

923
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:36,447
Go home.

924
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:38,482
Search it on the way.

925
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,292
You may find the
courage you have lost.

926
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,673
What DSP said is not right...

927
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,848
...but at the same time
it's not wrong as well.

928
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:14,317
When the enemy wants to kill us,
we should do it first.

929
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:17,655
How many should we kill, father?

930
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:23,494
If killing is the solution then no
one killedthe right person yet.

931
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:29,334
You mean ourmission...
- You are missing the target.

932
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:32,242
There's no difference between
the policeman holding a gun...

933
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:35,510
...and you carrying a
gun in the forests.

934
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:37,642
Because.

935
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:47,252
...people like Shakti
Patnaik are still alive.

936
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:49,887
...in every village, at everywhere

937
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:54,327
You failed father. Everyone failed.

938
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:07,276
Bhagat...

939
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,657
He talked, but he talked in anger.

940
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:25,724
We hurt him

941
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:28,526
Alot.

942
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,331
It was not right I think

943
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:40,436
Oh! Do you also cry?

944
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:43,045
Sometimes we weep from here.

945
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:44,812
Sometimes...

946
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:53,984
Violence leads to grief.

947
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:59,867
And behind every kind of
violence there is agrief.

948
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:03,869
Where do I stand between them?

949
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,800
I don't understand it.

950
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:21,942
'You know why the gun didn't work? '

951
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:24,477
'The gun you buy from my
man doesn't work against me.'

952
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:45,758
'Bhagat, what you thought I
could never do in this life... '

953
01:32:46,627 --> 01:32:49,323
'I am goingto do that today.'

954
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,558
I will orderthe district SP.

955
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,329
He will arrest them all.

956
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:01,732
He will be out on bail
by tomorrow morning sir.

957
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,530
He is corrupted even the unit.

958
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:05,269
What are youtalking
Venkat! Are you not ashamed...

959
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:08,604
...to talk like that in
spite of being an officer?

960
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:09,733
We got usedto it, sir.

961
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:12,243
Alongwith common
public ourthe department...

962
01:34:12,346 --> 01:34:13,370
...has also become
used to criminals.

963
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,971
...and their back-door methods.

964
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:16,981
My sincerity alone won't do, sir.

965
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:19,309
There are criminals
in our department too.

966
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:22,822
His criminality is apparent.
That'sthe only difference

967
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:26,786
That's the reason I came here.

968
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,797
I came here with the hope
that no one got used to it yet.

969
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:35,261
I wanted to give themthe taste
of the fruits of this academy...

970
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:38,634
...before they get
rotten inthe market.

971
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:44,366
What do you mean?

972
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:49,907
If you support me I can
clean Shakti and his gang.

973
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:52,813
I don't want too much.

974
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:56,320
Just give me fourtrainee officers
- What nonsense!

975
01:34:56,624 --> 01:34:57,648
That's impossible.

976
01:34:58,492 --> 01:34:59,516
It's ridiculous.

977
01:35:00,294 --> 01:35:01,318
Our rules won't agree

978
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,327
Get out. Get out from here

979
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:10,894
I will go, sir.

980
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,664
You put your hand on
your heart and say...

981
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:14,798
...that the IPS officers
you have trained till now...

982
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:17,443
None of them have
done a mistake till now.

983
01:35:18,345 --> 01:35:19,369
You say that and I will leave sir.

984
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:26,715
I won't make a mistake
like my father did sir.

985
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:42,266
I want to do
everything in a properway...

986
01:35:42,369 --> 01:35:45,998
...even if we have to take
some improper ways forthat.

987
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:47,397
Training doesn't
happen between fourwalls...

988
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:48,998
...of the academy or at
the firing range, sir.

989
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:51,234
Apoliceman must get
training among the people...

990
01:35:51,345 --> 01:35:53,245
...who he would serve
and among the criminals.

991
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:55,247
...he will have fordeal
with infuture sir.

992
01:35:55,616 --> 01:35:57,243
Ljust want to give some
practical experience...

993
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:58,909
...for yoursquad. That's all, sir.

994
01:36:16,637 --> 01:36:17,661
Sleepless nights.

995
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,667
You can't sleep at night right?

996
01:36:20,574 --> 01:36:23,338
I too thought about it.
May be you are right.

997
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:26,243
When the system fails we
shouldn't go out of the way.

998
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:28,247
If we go out of
the way and succeed...

999
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:29,907
...the system will fail forever.

1000
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:36,522
But to rectify the system it's
alright to go out of the way.

1001
01:36:37,892 --> 01:36:39,450
How many guys you askedfor?
- Four.

1002
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,257
Ok. I will give you four
of my best candidates.

1003
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:45,254
Go and clear the problem

1004
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:46,458
I don't need the best officers, sir.

1005
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,466
Give me four least talented
officers of the academy, sir.

1006
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:51,269
That will do forme.

1007
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:55,532
Yes sir.

1008
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,437
Yes sir.
- Yes, sir.

1009
01:36:59,547 --> 01:37:00,571
Yes sir.

1010
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,793
There was only one
month'straining left.

1011
01:37:12,893 --> 01:37:14,258
We were about to be
relieved and this nuisance...

1012
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,266
What should we do?
What do you want us to do?

1013
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:25,270
What canthe four of us do
when the entire police force.

1014
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:28,466
...couldn't do anything
over there all these years?

1015
01:37:30,377 --> 01:37:32,242
This is not practically possible

1016
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:40,252
To give lectures about
if it's possible or not...

1017
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,254
...the government doesn't
need spend millions of rupees...

1018
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:45,257
...and give you the badge of the
prestigious Indian Police Service.

1019
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,593
We already have
politicians to give lectures

1020
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:51,523
Whether it's forthe dowry your
father-In-law would give you...

1021
01:37:51,999 --> 01:37:54,092
...or if you couldn't get a seat in
IAS or for the name in society...

1022
01:37:54,602 --> 01:37:57,162
...you may have your
reasons forjoining IPS.

1023
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:03,434
But I am not the only
one facing injustice.

1024
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:06,237
There are many others like me
I am taking you along...

1025
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:08,247
...only to prove you that
there are many such people

1026
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:10,249
If a policeman stands in
front of their house with agun...

1027
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:12,649
...in hand people
would sleep in peace.

1028
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:16,252
But if someone else
holdsthe same gun...

1029
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:20,384
...people won't be in peace
That is the value of police.

1030
01:38:21,428 --> 01:38:23,453
It's your choice if you
four want to come or not.

1031
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:27,665
But if you want to go back
don't go to the academy.

1032
01:38:29,703 --> 01:38:30,795
Go back to your homes

1033
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:47,450
"March forward. March forward.
Let's march forward."

1034
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:51,921
"Let's destroy the darkness.
It's a war now."

1035
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:56,463
"March forward. March forward.
Let's march forward."

1036
01:38:56,697 --> 01:39:01,259
"Let's destroy darkness
It's a war now."

1037
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:05,327
'Young blood is onfire."

1038
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:09,866
"Shake mankind
from its slumber."

1039
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:14,379
"The crusade to
destroy evil has begun."

1040
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:18,846
"Make the enemies shiver with fear."

1041
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:21,245
"Hail Lord Shiva"

1042
01:39:21,355 --> 01:39:24,256
"This is not the end
This is the beginning."

1043
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:26,258
"This is going to be along battle."

1044
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,726
'Victory is the only option for us."

1045
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:35,268
"March forward. March forward.
Let's march forward."

1046
01:39:35,569 --> 01:39:39,665
"Let's destroy the darkness.
It's a war now."

1047
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:44,240
"March forward. March forward.
Let's march forward."

1048
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:48,845
"Let's destroy the darkness.
It's a war now."

1049
01:40:16,643 --> 01:40:19,771
"Hit the enemy with your hands."

1050
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:24,247
"Kick the enemy with your legs."

1051
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:28,246
"This is the answer for hunger."

1052
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:31,256
"This is the final blow."

1053
01:40:34,762 --> 01:40:39,256
"Our each step should
be a blow for them."

1054
01:40:39,366 --> 01:40:43,666
"Let's fight the enemy with unity."

1055
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:48,273
"Our each step should
be a blow for them."

1056
01:40:48,575 --> 01:40:52,978
"Let's fight the enemy with unity."

1057
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:57,244
"Let's tear apart every demon here."

1058
01:40:57,351 --> 01:41:01,788
"Let's make a fist and
show them our anger."

1059
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:06,255
"Let's make even fear
run away with fear."

1060
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:10,797
"This is the ultimate
battle for survival."

1061
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:15,462
"We must make the
tyrant pay for his sins."

1062
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:18,265
"Let us be as mighty as an army."

1063
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:20,465
"Let's cleanse this society."

1064
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,667
"Law and truth is on our side"

1065
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:27,236
"March forward. March forward.
Let's march forward."

1066
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:31,443
"Let's destroy the darkness.
It's a war now."

1067
01:41:31,819 --> 01:41:35,915
"March forward. March forward.
Let's march forward."

1068
01:41:36,023 --> 01:41:40,527
"Let's destroy the darkness.
It's a war now."

1069
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:40,788
"Let's destroy the darkness.
It's a war now."

1070
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:47,926
You got scared?

1071
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:51,328
It's anice garden.

1072
01:41:51,705 --> 01:41:53,263
So you are hiding here?
- Hey!

1073
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:54,806
I heard you are
feeling to Hyderabad.

1074
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:56,670
You asked for the
police protection, right?

1075
01:41:57,611 --> 01:41:58,635
That's why I came here

1076
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:02,442
For any person the last shield
of protection is the police force.

1077
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:04,239
Hand over Bhagat to me.

1078
01:42:04,818 --> 01:42:07,446
...or else no one in your
family will stay alive

1079
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,248
Hey, DSP, not me, arrest him
- Don't shout.

1080
01:42:35,749 --> 01:42:38,513
Shakti, you called me a dog, right?

1081
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:41,245
Even a dog takes orders from
the master who is stronger.

1082
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:43,255
Only one of you will survive

1083
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:44,790
And I will take orders from him

1084
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:52,931
Shakti, you are not a man.
You are a problem.

1085
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:54,261
You are a problem

1086
01:42:56,970 --> 01:42:58,801
Venkatramana.
- Sir. - Get them all into custody.

1087
01:42:58,906 --> 01:42:59,930
Ok, sir.

1088
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:04,442
Some problem can't be cured.
We have to uproot them.

1089
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:06,305
We have to clean it completely.

1090
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,771
I am also a problem for you now.

1091
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:11,316
Now one will interfere between us.

1092
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:49,246
Come on. Come on

1093
01:45:55,816 --> 01:46:00,253
"It's a chapter in history
which repeats again and again."

1094
01:46:00,487 --> 01:46:05,254
"The battle between good and evil
takes place in every generation"

1095
01:46:05,492 --> 01:46:09,656
"You have to pick the
weapon forthe fight today."

1096
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:14,666
"Your courage is
your biggest weapon."

1097
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:19,467
"This is the biggest
battle of yourlife."

1098
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:24,235
'When every place turns
into a battleground for you."

1099
01:46:24,478 --> 01:46:29,438
"...you have to pick your weapon."

1100
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:14,451
I want to see you as
well in uniform very soon.

1101
01:47:15,028 --> 01:47:18,520
And yes, I have a doubt.
What have you done to Shakti?

1102
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:20,924
If he is alive do
hand him overto us.

1103
01:47:21,902 --> 01:47:23,267
If I had handed him over to you...

1104
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:25,270
...I knew what
would've happened, sir.

1105
01:47:27,641 --> 01:47:29,802
At least people should
know that he has died

1106
01:47:30,477 --> 01:47:33,241
Our people make heroes
out of villains as well.

1107
01:47:37,684 --> 01:47:38,776
Let's just say he's
not there anymore, sir.

1108
01:47:43,824 --> 01:47:46,850
When will it end?
- It hasn't begun yet.

1109
01:47:48,628 --> 01:47:51,461
Anyone can bring a change
in any way you wish right?

1110
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:54,267
Then what'sthe need
of police training now?

1111
01:47:54,835 --> 01:47:56,462
Anyone can bring about a change

1112
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:59,465
Fighting evil is like
standing on a quagmire

1113
01:48:01,508 --> 01:48:06,445
Many people begin it well,
but slowly sink in it.

1114
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:09,644
That's why only
police should fight evil.

1115
01:48:11,351 --> 01:48:12,648
That's what this training is for.

1116
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:16,585
I will be back soon.
