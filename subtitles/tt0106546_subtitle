00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,080
The same incident, get up and see.

17
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,040
Then must have fly away.

18
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,280
l don't believe this same reason everyday.

19
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
How does it possible? l've locked the cage.

20
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,560
l've counted yesterday before l sleep.

21
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,680
Even our trained birds are also missing?

22
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,640
l asked several times to find some way out.

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,480
Who cares of my word, your birds, your investment and nothing to me.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,240
l'll go wherever l wish to.

25
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,240
Remember, we have not stock of food.

26
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,640
The same bird, l can notice her well, ... this is third time she trapped.

27
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,320
How nice...

28
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,520
so cool...as nothing has happened.

29
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,520
She doesn't even know that l can sale her to Master.

30
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,400
Do you need some more Laka da? l have extra bread sweets.

31
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,400
No...give it to your father.

32
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,720
Lakha da, lt seems you'ld feel better if you get the birds free from cage.

33
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,760
You are so compassionate of birds, is't it?

34
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,760
Birds inside the cage, does it looks good?

35
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,840
You are not doing it correct.

36
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,680
you have already freed four birds.

37
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,920
lf you're trying to make me fool, do it,

38
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,640
but do you ever think of your family?

39
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,880
You've already taken advance from Sansmal Babu.

40
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,880
How do you repay the amount until you offer birds.

41
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,240
l don't like this bird dealings any more.

42
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,520
lt's your family business, once you give up how will you survive?

43
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,520
l wedged and sold many birds only to survive.

44
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and peoples of the city kills and gobble half of them.

45
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,480
lt hurts me deeply when l realize.

46
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,640
Only due to us these birds depart their life.

47
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,320
l don't have the same opinion, it's one kind of job doing by us,

48
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,320
otherwise how do we survive lf we don't do this?

49
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, l do agree...

50
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
but sometimes this kind of job feels me terrible,

51
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,360
as l feel that, birds are asking there are different kind of job to do,

52
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
then why do we grab them?

53
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,800
and confine them into cage?

54
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,800
and if so, why sale us to someone?

55
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,880
Do you remember Netai... my three years son,

56
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,440
yes ...a little bit, lt's quite a long ago.

57
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,840
...l guess more than 7 years,

58
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,600
l never reveal you a fact, Bhushan uncle.

59
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,760
when Netai passes away,

60
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,880
just few days before the incident l've seen a bird was died inside the cage,

61
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,080
lt's so natural occurrence ...

62
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,920
But the event hurts my son deeply,

63
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,800
he was going somewhere carrying the dead bird,

64
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,720
l saw, he was digging a hole and implanting that bird.

65
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,400
l asked him the reason behind it,

66
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:25,520
He answered implanting a tree of birds.

67
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,680
Now a days l recall his words frequently.

68
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
lt's child state of mind,

69
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,080
Not exactly, uncle.

70
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,560
He appears in my dream during the day of selling these birds.

71
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,560
l can see he is quite upset.

72
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,480
When he was alive l used to entrap many birds everyday ...

73
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,840
But he gets upset when l go for deals with birds.

74
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,880
Already passes many days...

75
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,000
Wife is now out of any affliction of my son.

76
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,720
She is trying to think for new reason to live.

77
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,720
l too have the same eagerness...

78
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,720
...like those birds.

79
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,880
Now l've no grievance for Netai.

80
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,880
l can't see his face appropriately in my dream.

81
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,880
But the fellow has taught me to feel affection for birds.

82
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,600
Now l feel, l've got more affection of those birds than Netai.

83
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,760
Lakha, don't speak like idiot.

84
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,160
get involve into your family.

85
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,920
Bird is our life to survive,

86
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,600
dealing in birds brings us food, otherwise we'll die.

87
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,680
Try to make her understand,

88
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,840
ask her to take care of you.

89
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,840
l've so many things to discuss.

90
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,800
What are you doing Netai?

91
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,840
l'm implanting a bird, a tree of birds will grow up.

92
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,840
Netai ...

93
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,520
Sari ... Sari.. Yes ...what happened?

94
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,520
Look there... That bird of Netai ...

95
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,600
What odd are you doing at this midnight?

96
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,160
Lie down ...

97
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,160
get sleep now.

98
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,920
You become so changed, Sari.

99
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,360
Yes ...

100
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,760
Do you still love me?

101
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,000
Do you ?

102
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,760
l've no one other than you.

103
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,760
Why? ...your birds!

104
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,680
Why are you asking at this midnight?

105
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,680
Get sleep.

106
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
Lakha,.. why didn't you come to office with your birds?

107
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,840
Because birds were not caged, so.

108
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,720
Okay, l agree, but what about the stocks already with you?

109
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,360
Won't you deliver those?

110
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,280
this time we have huge orders from city.

111
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,000
and you know very well that Sansmal babu depends only on you,

112
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,280
even he has already given you a large amount as an advance.

113
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,840
You must come tomorrow with your stock of birds.

114
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,400
Make him happy by supplying a large amount of birds.

115
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,760
Let's see, l'll be there very soon.

116
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,120
But few birds has come into lake this season,

117
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,120
How can other people does? No one will believe this excuse.

118
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,880
Have you seen? Yes ...

119
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,240
l was planning to ask you something since few days.

120
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
Now tell me... Do you know that ...

121
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,480
when you get busy in your job, roaming around lake and behind birds...

122
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,480
then that bustard use to come to your wife.

123
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,320
How do you get this information, since you spend all along the day with me.

124
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,080
may be l roam here and there due to my job...

125
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,040
but what about other villagers? Can't they see or understand anything?

126
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,840
People can say anything, don't rely on them.

127
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,840
What a wise decision,

128
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,920
you'll stay in village and asking to stay away from villagers.

129
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,920
l'm cautioning you repeatedly, be careful of your family.

130
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,920
Lakha, ... don't do it.

131
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,440
You are just impossible Lakha,

132
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,320
what kind of man are you?

133
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,320
you are still freeing birds, how long will you continue this?

134
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,320
Lots of bird...where they come from?

135
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,280
Endless birds, despite caging all,

136
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,440
There are lots and lots of birds in this universe?

137
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,120
certainly there are lots of birds, otherwise how they appear.

138
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,560
no one knows ...

139
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,440
Sometimes it feels like they are not belongs to this universe.

140
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,680
Otherwise it never ends, continuously appears appears.

141
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,120
meaningless ...

142
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,000
just imagine ...

143
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,160
my father and grand father has done, ..

144
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,360
their four father were in the same profession, they have done...

145
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,640
you people are same,

146
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,280
All they are passes away long ago,

147
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,240
But this birds are still exist.

148
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,280
One day you see all human being will disappear for their endless sin.

149
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,280
only these birds will survive in this universe, ... you see that.

150
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,080
You have to go to market today,

151
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,720
then l'll go along with you to Sansmal Babu's office.

152
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,720
let's deliver the birds, last few days we have gathered enough birds.

153
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,080
Bhusan uncle ...

154
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,640
Our village stream assembles with river ...

155
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,480
...and this river gets assembles with ocean, ...

156
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,080
yes...what odd in it?

157
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,160
Have you ever seen ocean? ...No..

158
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,320
Once l've seen someone who has seen ocean,

159
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,360
a strange sound of roaring comes out of it,

160
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,480
.. and thousands of birds flies over it.

161
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,120
That's quite difficult to catch them,

162
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,440
but it brings huge money once you grab.

163
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:52,600
sometimes, l can hear that strange sounds of roaring,

164
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,600
and at the same time sounds of big wings ...

165
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,560
Can you explain, why does this happen? Don't know, all bogus...

166
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,720
Come on Lakha, ... our boat has come, let's go.

167
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,640
Where is your destination?

168
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,520
these all are your birds?

169
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,440
l'm also a dealer of birds...

170
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,680
Are you going to deliver birds at Nabin Sansmal's storehouse? Yes sir!

171
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,680
l'm from Calcutta, l'm also going there.

172
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,800
Have l ever seen you there?

173
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,720
You may have seen ...many peoples comes over there.

174
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,720
you're correct...but l visit very rare, my staff use to come frequently.

175
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,280
You people climbed at Nittanandapur wharf,

176
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,280
these all birds caged from there? Yes.

177
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,640
How much you get from Nabin Sansmal against each bird?

178
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,280
That is not fixed...sometimes Re 1 /-

179
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,280
and sometimes according to bird we get 3 to 5/-

180
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,560
l purchase birds from Sansmal... my stores is in Calcutta... at Hatibagan.

181
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,480
What will you do after purchase?

182
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,280

00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,320
You sale them to Sansmal and l sale them at Calcutta

185
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,000
after purchasing from Sansmal.

186
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,640
People purchase all these birds?

187
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,440
There are thousands of people to purchase.

188
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,320
people purchase for pet purpose, or for circus, zoo etc.

189
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,320

191
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,640
This has no end...there are many people like me who deals in birds.

192
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,280
Have you ever been at Calcutta, ... Hatibagan?

193
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,280
We went there once or twice, We don't have any spare time to visit Calcutta,

194
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,640
l've something to discuss with you,

195
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,560
you do one thing...

196
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,360
after you finish your job with Sansmal,

197
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,840
wait for me at market, l'll discuss over there.

198
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,640
only these few birds? ...

199
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,600
Natabar, what's happening? Why they are supplying small number of birds?

200
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,480
Don't you ask them regularly to supply?

201
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
l use to ask them every day, what else can l do, if they don't deliver.

202
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,360
Prahallad, your two birds are almost dead,

203
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
you could have bring complete dead.

204
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,720
they doesn't want to catch birds...

205
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,000

206
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,920

You've given four pair of Moina, three pieces parrot,

210
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,920
Lakaha, you've stop visiting here until you're informed by someone.

211
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,880
you didn't come last five days ...

212
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,800
did you ever count how much have you taken as an advance?

213
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,680
yes l remember... that should be more than 1 00/- bucks.

214
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,680
Come here with your cage.

215
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,800
Only thirty birds...

216
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,920
what shall l do with these?

217
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,840
lt took many days only to catch these little number of birds.

218
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,000
But l need more birds, Lakha.

219
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,000
lf you people don't supply, how do l arrange?

220
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,040
are you asking me to roam around lake?

221
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,000
Everyday peoples from Calcutta comes and places their order.

222
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,480
all birds of winter season.

223
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
this gentleman ...

224
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
has come from hotel at Calcutta.

225
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,080
places order for Teal... l'am ready and lie in ambush,

226
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,920
What can l do if they don't come..

227
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,120
only few birds has come this season, l guess specially in our area.

228
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,920
Why? How these people gets?

229
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,760
just few days back they've supplied.

230
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,760
even today they have come to deliver, and it's only you who doesn't get.

231
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:04,880
your wife has said to Natabar that You don't like to enclose birds at all.

232
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,840
l'm just coming ... Yes...you take a break.

233
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,040
l've taken advances from many peoples,

234
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,480
shall they keep quite if they don't get birds.

235
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,240
they won't ready to listen anything, only bird..

236
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,680
birds may not be available here, why don't you go some other place?

237
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,040
birds must be available, where can they vanish.

238
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,080
Nature is becoming polluted due to gas and smoke of factory...

239
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
birds will gradually stop coming.

240
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
not only smoke of factory...

241
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,240
this universe is almost finished due to war and huge bomb blasting.

242
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,480
let me ask my requirement ...

243
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,560
l need some money right now, then give us birds ...

244
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,240
Master ...again he needs money,

245
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,840
This is your bad habit Lakha ...

246
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,560
give him 1 0

247
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,560
yes...carry on.

248
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
This is address of my store,

249
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,480
A big city like Calcutta, can we able to find out your address?

250
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,920
yes you can, l said Hatibagan,

251
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,800
just show this paper and ask anybody, you'll reach.

252
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,800
after reaching Hatibagan ask for bird store of Kalicharan

253
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,800
take this as an advance ...

254
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,320
fare to reach Calcutta is also included in it,

255
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,560
next, you'll get money according to your supply of birds,

256
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,560
payment daily basis.

257
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,000
try to convince some other people who can supply me birds,

258
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,240
you'll get your commission, you can earn extra money.

259
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,640
and remember don't reveal our meeting to anyone, specially to Nabin Sansmal.

260
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,640
lf he comes to know, it's your risk, nothing to me.

261
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,920
You didn't do it correct,

262
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,680
We didn't do anything wrong, he has invited us.

263
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,920
lt's not that we won't sale birds to Sansmal Babu

264
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,600
birds will be distributed partly to Calcutta and partly to Sansmal.

265
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,840
otherwise he may doubt us, ... you've made a nice plan.

266
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,640
Just imagine, how we are being cheated by Sansmal Babu.

267
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,320
He gets 1 5/- to 20/- bucks against sale of each birds after

268
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,840
purchasing in cheap rate from us.

269
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,280
does he ever think of our existence.

270
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,000
We hunt birds and Sansmal Babu hunts us.

271
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:50,240
as sometimes birds escaped from us, we're also escaping from Sansmal Babu.

272
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,920
he is teaching us to cheat.

273
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,840
you always speaks rubbish.

274
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,000
lf you earn some extra money,

275
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,560
that will ultimately solve your family scarcity.

276
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,640
Gouri is enough matured and ideal to tie her knot..

277
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,680
l've to settle down her future.

278
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,320
There must be some personal needs of your companion.

279
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,640
if you provide her sufficient food and some ornaments,

280
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,280
she'll be with you for rest of your life.

281
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,120
what you're saying is correct.

282
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,800
ultimately l have to continue this trade any way.

283
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,800
otherwise who is standing beside you to help?

284
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,360
sometimes l get scared ...

285
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,240
scared of what?

286
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,640
l guess ...

287
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,640
you won't stay with me any more.

288
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,720
whom did you listen all these?

289
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,720
My feelings ...

290
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,000
Each and everyone of Sansmal Babu's store office knows ...

291
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,000
your extra marital affair with Natabar,

292
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,160
l would request you not to tear down our bindings,

293
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,840
do you really believe in our bindings?

294
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,920
have you ever notice the condition of our house?

295
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,320
Do you listen any of my words,

296
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,160
quite difficult to arrange sufficient food everyday.

297
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,240
do you notice my apron by any chance?

298
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,240
and you are asking for our relationship.

299
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,800
only when you want me to quench you physical needs.

300
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,320
but you never get tired of playing with birds any time.

301
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,360
still if you could grab some little more.

302
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,360
at least l get some money, otherwise ...

303
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,240
l would have die by starvation.

304
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,240
Who gives you money?

305
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Why do you need to know?

306
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,720
first you earn some money then show your male domination.

307
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,000
Now l will...

308
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,160
l'll earn a lot ...

309
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,280
l'll move to Calcutta ... l'll cage many birds...

310
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,280
and sale out there,

311
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,920
At least if Netai was alive...

312
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,920
you would have settle your mind.

313
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,440
that is my ill fate ...

314
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,040
l forget that pain any way...

315
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,040
lt's already passes many years,

316
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,920
still l couldn't fill up my lap further.

317
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,920
you have birds with you,

318
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,920
l have nothing ...

319
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,280
nothing ...

320
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,280
l don't like this bindings any more,

321
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,360
Netai ....

322
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,040
what are you doing this?

323
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,480
How lucky the bird is, fly away before she locked up.

324
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,480
fly away or you get her free.

325
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,520
you can trust me, l won't free birds any more.

326
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280
l'll take all birds to Calcutta and sale out there

327
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,560
l've to look after my family

328
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,160
Let's try once more.

329
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,800
Only one problem, sometime l get crazy.

330
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,080
l feel like freeing all birds.

331
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,080
lt's more than enough that you're realizing the fact.

332
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,520
just have a look at sky ...

333
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,480
rain looks nice when it falls over the forest ..

334
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,280
l'm just coming from forest, l haven't love trees many days.

335
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,480
will you join me to wet in rain?

336
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,480
l'm still in normal sense, you go,

337
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,400
now you get Natabar and strike him thrice.

338
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,640
He is trying to exploit Sari.

339
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,480
He must taught a good lesson.

340
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,560
The actual reality is,

341
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,920
if a women contemplates to do any awful, who'll stop?

342
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,920
who knows the fault could have done by her,

343
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,880
we have to make out a plan for Calcutta,

344
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,160
we have to carry all birds collected within next two days.

345
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,440
but there is a bit trouble, what trouble?

346
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,600
How do we carry these huge birds?

347
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,920
if we caught by police?

348
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,680
moreover if we are seen by workers of Sansmal?

349
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,560
that l have already decided,

350
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,400

but that is not true,

376
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,880
if you leave him to stay with me for ever ...

377
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,880
you'll get respect as my wife,

378
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,440

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,640
he'll get mad due to bird,

380
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,520
he caged birds ... and set them free.

381
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,120
he use to speak with birds ...

382
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,440
dreaming of birds ...

383
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,480
l'am no one in his world.

384
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,640
but sometimes it seems he is different kind ...

385
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,480
as he needs me too.

386
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,480
l don't get it clear.

l'll leave tomorrow for Calcutta,

393
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,640
where will you go?

394
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,080

395
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,840
How will you go? Did you ever go Calcutta?

396
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,920
Bhushan uncle will join me,

397
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,880
l won't sale birds to Sansmal any more.

398
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,520
a trader of Calcutta visited here,

399
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,760
he invited us to sale,

400
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,640
and offered better price,

401
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,800
and l don't know anything about this?

402
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,600
didn't l say that day?

403
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,280
henceforth l'll sale huge birds,

404
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,760
for selling purpose l'll go.

405
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,920
you're accustomed of escaping caged birds.

406
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,520
lt's quite difficult to give-up this habit.

407
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,160
lt's better to escape me like caged birds.

408
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,120
that won't be painful for you.

409
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,800
and you'll forget soon if really you feel like.

410
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,160
lf l gets you free you'll go into some other cage.

411
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,160
instead of that why don't you give me a chance?

412
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,280
and if l can will you forget Natabar?

413
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,880
Bhushan uncle...are you still sleeping?

414
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,880
he's gone to river, will back soon, you seat.

415
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,040

as it's your normal nature.

418
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,760
No ...

419
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,760
l won't do that any more.

420
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,240
l love to see the moment, when you releases birds from the cage.

421
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,360
lt doesn't suits anything else to you.
