1
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,600
Let's do as Pandian said
and not go to Koovathur

2
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,960
Yes! Let's take the
Tindivanam route

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
Then you go to left

4
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,720
Krishnakiri - 205
Dindivanam - 28

5
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,920
Dude!

6
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,640
Oh! Counting it?

7
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Is it less?

8
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,520
You guys stay here and make
a mess out of this place?

9
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
Who do you think will pay for it?
Your dad?

10
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,280
Get lost!

11
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Show some pity on orphans...

12
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,720
and they show me their attitude

13
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,040
Hey catch him! Thief! Thief!

14
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,640
Dude, a thief!

15
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
Dude, my gravy!

16
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
Catch!

17
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,600
Stop! Give me the bag!

18
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,480
Look the thief is
beating up Kaduhu!

19
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,320
Hold him

20
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
Don't leave him

21
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,760
Let go of me!

22
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
Get it

23
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,040
Urulai, come on!

24
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,720
Let go of me!

25
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,360
Urulai, come on!

26
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,920
Hey!

27
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,560
That is my bag

28
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,640
My passport

29
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,280
Now, how about that? We just
knocked him and rocked it!

30
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,560
Thank you.
Please..

31
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,160
- Please, take it
- Stop showing off and take it

32
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,680
- Dude, take it
- Take it

33
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,360
Here, Rs. 10,000.
Count it

34
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,080
Dude, whoa!

35
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,320
Three foreign currencies
earned us thirty local ones!

36
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,920
That's foreign currencies for you!

37
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,680
Rs. 10,000. Let's use
this and fly abroad!

38
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,600
This is waste

39
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,840
Look, there he goes again

40
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,200
This won't work out

41
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
Damn! Nothing's working out

42
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,080
Too much make up

43
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,640
That's fine.
We can adjust

44
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,360
Listen, I'm looking for a bride!
Damn it!

45
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
What's the hurry for my marriage?

46
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,520
Now look at him!

47
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,840
Still a minor and
talks about marriage

48
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,080
Pity me! I earn a handful and
yet I'm not finding a bride

49
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,320
Relax! Calm down.
Check out the next photo

50
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,440
Whoa! Looks pretty scary!

51
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,640
It's because of her lipstick

52
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
To hell with their make up

53
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,600
She'll turn old soon

54
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,840
Rejected

55
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,360
I'd be ok if she had
a beautiful sister

56
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,240
Shut up

57
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,840
Now, we're talking!

58
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,040
She has beautiful eyes

59
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,240
I better send her an interest

60
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,680
I love you, baby

61
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,840
Wow! Superb!

62
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,560
Guys, I'm the one
looking for bride

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,560
Greetings

64
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,000
The topic we have chosen
for Today's debate is...

65
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,480
...one of the most hot
topic in our state

66
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
Do we need the
liquor shops or not?

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,880
To discuss this topic we have two
important political leaders here

68
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,480
Our State Industries
Minister, Mr.Rajamanickam

69
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,560
- Hello Sir
- Hello

70
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,080
Another one is opposition
leader Mr.Dhandapani

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
- Hello, sir
- Hello

72
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,920
Dear minister, in many places ladies
are protesting against liquor shops

73
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,440
What is the our
government's stand on this?

74
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
Is it important or not?

75
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,960
Are TV serials important
for ladies at home?

76
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,520
Are YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,
Cricket are all important for youths?

77
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,520
Sounds stupid

78
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,880
Is watching TV serials, playing
cricket same as the liquor shops?

79
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,160
Ask him to talk with sense

80
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,520
What you are talking?

81
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,480
Do you think people started drinking after
the government opened liquor shops?

82
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,480
Drinking is a habit that
dates back to ancient times

83
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,400
Even now in villages they offer
liquor to God while praying

84
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,720
He sounds like liquor is as
important as the oxygen we breathe

85
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,680
Whatever it may be, that's fine

86
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,680
My point is, it is not
consumed with in the limits

87
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,400
There are liquor shops
in almost every street

88
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,240
A new scheme might pop up saying
'Free liquor for smart card holders'

89
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,600
The drunkard will spoil himself
but a teetotaler will prosper

90
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,200
Now that's a funny logic

91
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,960
He will never allow to
close the liquor shops

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,640
He owns most of the
government bars in the state

93
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,840
He will lose his business

94
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,320
That is why he is
just talking nonsense

95
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,680
His is jealous because
he didn't win any seat

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,200
That's what is driving him
to blame me unnecessarily

97
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,320
Blame you unnecessarily?

98
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,400
You loot millions from the
people and act innocent

99
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,520
I expose you and you say I'm
blaming you unnecessarily?

100
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,520
The public may not be
aware of all your frauds

101
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,640
But I know everything

102
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,600
- Stop talking like a fool!
- How dare you?

103
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,680
- Hey, it's ok
- Are you kidding?

104
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
Is it the way you conduct the
interview in your channel?

105
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,200
He is talking unwanted things and
you're just being a mute spectator!

106
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,600
Tell him move away

107
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,560
Please, maintain the decorum.
We are on live tv

108
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,920
Stay out.
Listen to me. Go

109
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Come on, sir

110
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,880
These are all
baseless accusations

111
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Do you have proof?
Then go ahead and prove it

112
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,000
So, only proofs can stop you
from doing illegal activities?

113
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,760
He is the one who tore the shirt
of state assembly speaker

114
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,520
Let us not blame the individuals
and use strong words here

115
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,960
Just answer his question

116
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,400
I will answer

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,200
Even though I am a minister,
I'm always one among people

118
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
I keep account for all my earnings

119
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,400
I pay my taxes. Whats
else do you all need?

120
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,680
If you want to blame me
then prove it with evidences

121
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,520
Do it and I will quit from politics

122
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Quit and it'll be
good for the state

123
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,400
Thanks and Bye

124
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,720
Boss, the head constable is here

125
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,880
Ask him to come

126
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,320
Sir, please come in

127
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,760
Pandian, get him a chair to sit

128
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
Have a seat

129
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,080
What do you like to have?
Beer or brandy or whiskey?

130
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,280
Thanks, Muruga. I am here
to convey something

131
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,400
Tell me

132
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,480
You are opening the liquor
shop an hour earlier

133
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,480
A complaint has been registered
in our police station

134
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,760
So, what about it?

135
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Send one of your man to our station

136
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,280
We shall keep him in
custody for day and leave

137
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,920
Do you know whose bar this is?

138
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,120
Guys who work here
are dear to me

139
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,440
Arrest them and you'll
face the consequences

140
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,840
Fine. I won't arrest
any of your guys

141
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,760
Then you must stop opening the
liquor shop an hour earlier

142
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,200
If this issue escalates
then I can't help

143
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,840
Don't create
unnecessary problems

144
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,040
Look, let this be between us

145
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,200
Let it not reach Chinna

146
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
'With Diwali coming up...'

147
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,360
'The government liquor shops are given a
target sale business of Rs.5 billion'

148
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,040
Have a seat, Mr.Rajaram

149
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,000
Thank you, sir

150
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,520
Hope you saw the news

151
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,760
Rs.5 billion target
for liquor shops

152
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,280
Do they want our department
also to help them?

153
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Forget that...

154
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,880
but we must stop the
illicit liquors being sold

155
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,560
Every year the government
fixes such targets

156
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,320
But they fall short

157
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,280
The reason being that in most of the
places duplicate liquors are sold

158
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,800
Sir, this cannot happen
without political support

159
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,560
On one hand they wanna run the shop
and on the other they wanna shut it

160
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,360
On top of that a
target of Rs.5 billion

161
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,560
It's again them who smuggle
and sell duplicate liquors

162
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,400
Ok Rajaram.
What can be done?

163
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,520
If we assign this case to someone else...

164
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
they will get bribed
and walk away

165
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,680
Only the honest officers
like you can stop it

166
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,200
So please take charge of it

167
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,320
Sure sir

168
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,160
Make sure you get the
payment from Narayanan

169
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,120
- Ok chief
- And those...

170
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
All liquors sent to Madurai has returned

171
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,720
But how?

172
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,520
The label has been
pasted upside down

173
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,680
Who was in charge of it?

174
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,800
Dinesh

175
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,720
Can't you get a label
pasted correctly?

176
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,520
Sorry, boss

177
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,800
We are the best sellers in Madurai.
Never failed till date!

178
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,160
All liquors have been sent back!

179
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
Happy?

180
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,080
Can't even paste a label properly,
then what are you good for?

181
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,400
Promise it won't happen again

182
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,640
Boss, call for you

183
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,120
- Tell me, Muruga
- Chinna?

184
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,320
Liquor is exhausted

185
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
I was expecting a call last week

186
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,000
So the stock just got over?

187
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,200
People here are demanding
for original liquor

188
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,800
It's a daunting task to
adulterate and sell 'em

189
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,960
Look here

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
I don't care what you do

191
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,200
Your customers should
buy only my liquor!

192
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Okay Chinna

193
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,760
- Listen
- Yes, boss

194
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,240
We got to deliver liquor
at Murugan's bar today

195
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,720
- I'll send
- Make sure it's done

196
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,360
Sir, AC [Assistant Commissioner]
Rajaram is coming here

197
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,600
Why in the hell is
he coming here?

198
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,400
Tell me, Sekar

199
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,680
Chinna, is any of your liquor truck
on the way to Chennai today?

200
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,760
Yes

201
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,280
Halt it where ever it is

202
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,640
AC Rajaram is coming here now

203
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,920
Send it after I tell you

204
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,880
You want me to halt it?

205
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,400
Then why are we bribing you?

206
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,920
Didn't you show off that
you rule the check post?

207
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,240
Listen, the AC, Rajaram is
very strict police officer

208
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,680
Sekar, can you
help us out or no?

209
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,920
Wasn't I helping you all these days?

210
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,520
Try to understand, Chinna

211
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,640
My truck must pass the check post safely

212
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,720
It will!

213
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,280
Nobody can stop it

214
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,280
You just shut up and be quiet

215
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,400
We will do whatever is necessary

216
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,840
Arrogant fellow!

217
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,480
Move, keep going.

218
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,080
Get me my cap

219
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,920
Sekar, whats happening?

220
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,160
Usual checking, sir

221
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
Stop. Stop

222
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,200
What is in vehicle?

223
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,520
Nothing, sir

224
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,320
I did warn you guys!

225
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,560
Check inside

226
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,600
Hey! Watch out!

227
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,280
What's with the rash driving?

228
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,480
Go! Drive!

229
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,720
Sorry sir

230
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,720
We lost the control out of fear

231
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,840
Do you think highway is the
place to teach driving?

232
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,080
You drive the vehicle

233
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,360
Sorry, sir

234
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
- Bro!
- What is it?

235
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,640
What about the job we asked for?

236
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,760
Not the time! You stupid.
Get lost

237
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,480
Kaaka...

238
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,840
Now, come on.
Come here

239
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,280
- Tell me
- Answer this phone

240
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,560
- Hello
- Hello

241
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,240
Greetings

242
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,360
It's me, Madhu

243
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,240
I saw your photo and video
in matrimonial site

244
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,840
Hi Madhu

245
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,560
Your name itself is
giving me a kick

246
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,360
But you sound like a man

247
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,720
Aiyo, I'm the bride's father, Madhusudhanan

248
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,680
Thank God!

249
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,800
You mentioned that you're
doing a government job

250
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,800
You didn't mention the salary though

251
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,760
Inclusive of tips, I take home
every month around Rs. 30,000

252
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,560
Whoa! Inclusive of tips!

253
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,320
Also I get snacks and
side dishes anytime

254
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,480
Dear, son-in-law! My
daughter is gifted!

255
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,320
- Dd you just call me 'son-in-law?'
- Hello

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,520
Dear, son-in-law?

257
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,120
Yes, dear father-in-law?

258
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,280
Where were you all this
time, dear father-in-law?

259
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,880
Does it even matter, dear

260
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,760
Tell me where are you
and your office address

261
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,680
What?
My office address?

262
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,840
The whole state is filled with
my office and it's branches

263
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,000
From 12 noon to 10 PM, the only
happening and busy department is mine

264
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,880
I don't meet anyone
during working hours

265
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,560
Come on, dear

266
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,120
I won't disturb you

267
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,120
I'll just see you work
from a distance and leave

268
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,320
- Poor fellow. Say yes
- From a distance?

269
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,240
Fine, do you know
MMDA near Koyambedu?

270
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,680
Are you working in MMDA?

271
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,800
No, dear father-in-law

272
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,120
State Bank Colony in MMDA

273
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,720
So you work at the State bank?

274
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,640
Come on, now!

275
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
I meant in that area

276
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,600
A government office in that area?

277
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,480
The government bar in that area...

278
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,920
The organization next to the bar?

279
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,720
No, dear father-in-law.
I meant the bar itself

280
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,320
Useless fellow! You work
in a government bar...

281
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,520
and you think that makes you
a government employee?

282
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,400
I'll slap you! Wonder how
many are there like you

283
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,080
Listen! Isn't this too
run by the government?

284
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,680
He is not making a
living out of bribe

285
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,040
He works hard for his salary

286
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,600
You never appreciate the truth

287
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
But you guys turn up to
bars when you need a drink

288
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,720
And government need
bars to make money

289
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,360
But you won't accept a groom
who is works in such bars?

290
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,200
Let me speak!

291
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,920
Don't look at the fact that
groom is working in a bar...

292
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,480
instead check if he is not a drunkard

293
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,040
Is he a good fellow or not?

294
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,920
Thank you for that performance.
He was the only person interested in me

295
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,280
Why can't they judge humans by
quality and not by their jobs?

296
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,320
See you!

297
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,400
Check this out

298
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,840
- Any freebies?
- What is it?

299
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,000
'Contact us for jobs abroad.'

300
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,320
We will go tomorrow

301
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,840
Yes?

302
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,800
We heard you are recruiting
man power for job abroad

303
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
0.5 million.

304
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,160
It'll cost you 0.5 million

305
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,440
Stop!

306
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,400
Can we meet sir...

307
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,920
No! You can't meet anyone.
Leave

308
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,200
Out...I said, come out

309
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,640
We've Rs. 10,000 with us

310
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,840
Take that and somehow get us a job abroad

311
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,600
With just Rs. 10,000?

312
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,440
- Get out!
- Sir! Sir! Please!

313
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
Don't you have any better
place to hang out?

314
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,320
What happened now?

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,320
What's your problem, guys?

316
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,480
Everyone curses us to die poor!

317
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,160
Stop blabbering

318
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
We went to apply for a job in Dubai

319
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,160
They are charging huge fee

320
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,360
They kicked us out

321
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,320
You guys hardly earn enough to
manage your bread and butter

322
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,480
And you wanna go abroad?

323
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,000
Aren't we allowed to
dream for a better life?

324
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Put yourself in our shoes for a
day and you'll know the pain

325
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,880
You should have stayed
back at the Orphanage

326
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,040
Who asked you come here?

327
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,120
That orphanage will
use us to make money

328
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,840
But they won't feed
us a proper meal

329
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,120
To eat you must earn.
Can't you get a job here?

330
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,240
To get a better job,
someone must refer us

331
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,840
How much ever hard we work, we
can't make more than Rs. 300/day

332
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,680
Out of which we are charged
half for our stay and food

333
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,600
More over we don't
have job everyday

334
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,880
We starve most of the days

335
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,600
Who is there to help us?

336
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,720
Stop saying that you have no one

337
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
I am here for you all

338
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,240
Don't you guys worry

339
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,360
I know a travel agent

340
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Let's go meet him. Ok?

341
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,000
Ok bro

342
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,560
You guys will definitely go abroad.
Not a big deal. Ok?

343
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,040
Pandian! Welcome.
What is the matter?

344
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
These boys wants to
go abroad for job

345
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,240
That's why I brought them here

346
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,080
They are close to me

347
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,880
They work in the bar,
trading empty bottles

348
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,840
How long can they
continue with it?

349
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,320
They have no one

350
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,200
They are struggling

351
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,000
Help them with some job abroad
and they'll be better off

352
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,840
Do you have 'Aadhar card?'

353
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,840
Who's that?

354
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,280
Right!

355
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,120
Aadhar card is provided by government
with your finger prints for identity

356
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,200
Sir, you mean police station?

357
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,160
You do look like someone
who has been there often

358
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,520
You need 'Aadhar card' to prove that
you are a citizen of this country

359
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,240
I am a citizen! I'm a citizen!

360
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,840
Pandia, are you nuts?

361
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,600
These guys don't
even have identity

362
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,920
This won't work out.
Take them away

363
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,920
They are good guys.
They are like brothers to me

364
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
I believed that you will help them

365
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,120
Greetings, sir

366
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,680
Why are you guys blocking my way?

367
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Fine! Come to our
tea shop tomorrow

368
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,640
Look Pandia, in order to
go abroad for a job..

369
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,080
there a many expenses like
passport, visa, ticket etc.

370
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,320
What's your plan for that?

371
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,440
Tell us how much it'll
cost and we'll arrange it

372
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,560
It'll come around three

373
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,000
Told you!
He'll get it done very cheaply

374
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,880
- Three? So...
- Listen you fool!

375
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,240
I meant Rs. 300,000 not three rupees!

376
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,240
Rs. 300,000

377
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,240
Dude, shut up!

378
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
They aren't rich.
They are indeed poor

379
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,440
Please give us some concession

380
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,400
Concession? Does this
look like grocery deal?

381
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,480
Look, there two new malls almost
in finishing stage in Dubai

382
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,960
They need lot of man power
of maintenance etc.

383
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,880
Arrange the money

384
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,760
And once the passport is here, I'll
get your visas ready in three days...

385
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
and send you abroad

386
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,000
Sounds good,
but Rs. 300,000 is a bit high

387
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,160
What can I do?
Fine, for you guys...

388
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,520
pay an advance of Rs. 50,000 and
pay the rest when I tell you

389
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,160
Here, there's Rs. 10,000 in it

390
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,240
- Have this for now
- Rs. 10,000?

391
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,840
- Arrange the remaining when he tells
- Ok bro

392
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,040
Come on, guys!

393
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,520
Remember to take passport size
photos before applying for passports

394
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,480
Don't scare the studio guy in this attire

395
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,600

Hold on. Hold on

You're the first girl ever to talk to him

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,640
That's why he is stunned

480
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680

What are you saying?

530
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,880
Yes bro!

531
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,920
In the photo studio, a girl
took him inside and...

532
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,640
Took him inside and...

533
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,160
Proposed her love to him

534
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
She proposed him?

535
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,440
Who is she?

536
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,640
She abused us when
we asked her that

537
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,920
She proposed him and then yelled at him
"Why are you standing like a statue?"

538
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,480
Of course! If some girl
did the same to me...

539
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,160
guess what I would've done

540
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,320
Dude...err...No, I didn't mean it

541
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,080
She asked us "Aren't you here for
dubmash?"and then kicked us out

542
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,600
Bro, what is dubmash?

543
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
Dubmash?

544
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,840
Sounds like a cracker name

545
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,320
No, it's something used
to mimic cinema dialogues

546
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,280
Damn! Pot heads!

547
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,240
That's not dubmash, it's Dubsmash!

548
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,040
- Look here
- Dubsmash?

549
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,160
Can you see it?

550
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,360
You must just do the lip movement
and act for movie dialogues

551
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,240
Then post it on the internet

552
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,840
Can we watch her
dubsmash videos in this?

553
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,400
Let's try finding her

554
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,640
Watch out!

555
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,440
There are totally 150
colleges in Chennai

556
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,320
On average, 1200
students per college

557
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,200
Half of them are girls

558
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,640
"600 * 150 = 90000"

559
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,040
Out this 10% girls will be jobless
and doing dubsmash all the time

560
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,040
Now, what's all the build up for?

561
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,800
Check out how many out there
are doing this all the time

562
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,400
She hired a studio! She
must be dubsmash addict!

563
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,360
- Yes
- Correct

564
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,680
There are few who become
celebrities doing dubsmash

565
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,520
Let's find out if the girl you
talk about is one among them

566
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,560
Is she the one?

567
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,960
This one?

568
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,280
No. No. No. No...

569
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,080
This one?

570
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:28,840
That's her!

571
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,880
That's her bro!

572
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,160
She is quite famous
for her dubsmash

573
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,720
Dubsmash queen, Anjana

574
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,200
An...jana? Lina is missing

575
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,560
And still she is called the Queen?

576
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,040
Shut up! Anjana...

577
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,160
"You aren't stable"

578
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,720
"You legs are steady"

579
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,960
"First become stable"

580
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,320
"Then come and tell me"

581
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,800
"I have my eyes set on you,
because I'm the one for you"

582
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,120
This is the manufacturing
company in Germany

583
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,880
I have done all the arrangements

584
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,960
Since it's a big deal, they
want to meet you in person

585
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,960
A small doubt is enough
and we'll all be doomed!

586
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,560
I have a different arrangement

587
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
This is Michael

588
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,040
He works in that German company

589
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
Contact him and he'll
get the work done

590
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,760
Trustworthy?

591
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,120
You bet. He is trustworthy

592
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,480
It's his duty to ensure that our stuff
reaches India without any issues

593
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,440
This should remain a secret
between the two of us...

594
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,440
Sir, no one will even
know that we both met

595
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,840
Here are the details
of that company

596
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,960
We have got only two weeks

597
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,600
We must get it done before that

598
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,160
You must go to Germany at once

599
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,360
Thank you, sir

600
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,560
Chinna, move the
container in to a ship

601
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,440
Don't bring it to land
until I give an order

602
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,440
Ok sir

603
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,920
- Book me a ticket to Germany for tomorrow
- Ok sir

604
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,880
No one must find out about
this until I'm back

605
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,840
- Ok sir
- Ok sir

606
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,160
Finally some company.
Thank God!

607
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Open the shutter!

608
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,840
- Excuse me
- Open it!

609
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,120
I'm waiting since morning 8. You
think they'll open for you?

610
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,760
- Follow queue
- Get lost!

611
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,920
Move!

612
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,360
Open the shutter! Open!

613
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,680
Who's that?

614
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,680
Don't they know the shop opens at noon?

615
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,360
- How long should we wait?
- Open up!

616
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,400
- Where is Pandian?
- Pandian...

617
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,080
Please come

618
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,200
Pandian, a girl is
here looking for you

619
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,400
A girl?

620
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,200
Looking for me?

621
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,600
Get me that tee shirt and pants!

622
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,560
Who among you is
looking for Pandian?

623
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,760
I'm the one

624
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,360
Yes!

625
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,360
Where is Pandian?

626
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,880
Why the rude tone?

627
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,480
Damn it!

628
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,560
I wanna confront that doofus.
Where is he?

629
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,760
Stop abusing.
I'm Pandian

630
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,200
You're Pandian?

631
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,920
Then who is this guy?

632
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,560
"I googled all over the world, yet
I couldn't find someone like her!"

633
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,840
"Get lost, you'll find some shy village
girl named Thenmozhi, Kanimozhi..."

634
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,400
"Go fall for her. I just won't suit you!"

635
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,600
"You won't like guys like me at first sight
but you'll like after you get used to us"

636
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,120
"Brother..."

637
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,440
"I already have a boy friend"

638
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,400
"I have no idea how to make
you fall in love with me"

639
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
"You tell me. How do I
get you to fall for me?"

640
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,720
When did he do all
this using my phone?

641
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,320
Kaaka

642
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,240
Kaaka?

643
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,320
He and his friends have
gone to the hospital

644
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,040
Mental hospital? I knew it!

645
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,880
No, for medical test to submit for
his verification for going abroad

646
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,800
Kaaka!

647
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,960
- Kaaka?
- Yes bro

648
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,360
- Look it's Dub-sis! Dub-sis!
- Shut up!

649
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,360
Are you stupid?

650
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,800
How dare you upload your video
against mine? Do you know who am I?

651
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,120
Do you know how
many fans I have?

652
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,560
- Did you just read out chinese hotel menu?
- Shut up!

653
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,760
That's a dialogue from
some English movie

654
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,440
But then Kaaka doesn't
understand English

655
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,560
Language doesn't matter

656
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,320
Love is the same
in all languages

657
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,840
Who do you think you are?

658
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
How dare you post
videos as my pair?

659
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,520
And how dare you upload them?

660
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,200
Everyone wants to know
if you are my boy friend

661
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Look! Remove all those video
before today evening!

662
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,760
- Or else, you'll be done for!
- Anjana...

663
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,880
- Enough
- Come, let's go!

664
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,120
Move!

665
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,760
Hi! Hello! Greetings! So, let's
see who is our chief guest today

666
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,800
The darling of the dubsmash.
Youngsters dream girl...

667
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,200
Your YouTube favorite princess

668
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
- Anjana
- Thank you!

669
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,040
- Thanks so much
- Greetings

670
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,480
So happy to have you
here at our studio

671
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,680
- Thank you
- Hope your fans must be happy too

672
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,240
That was too quick! We have our
first caller. Hello, greetings

673
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,720
Hello

674
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,480
Hello, greetings. Name and location please

675
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm Jyothi from Pallavaram

676
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,760
Anjana! Whoa! You're
very beautiful!

677
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
Your dubsmashes are
really awesome!

678
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,360
I have viewed your videos a million time.
Keep 'em coming

679
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,680
Thank you so much

680
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,160
This encouragement from you
is what keeps me going

681
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,800
Thank you

682
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,600
Hope you'll get more encouragement.
Next caller is on line. Greetings

683
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,720
Anjana? Is she there?

684
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,560
Yeah. Hello

685
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,120
Tell me, don't you have
better jobs to do?

686
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,920
Behave like a girl and
don’t you have manners?

687
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
What's the big deal about it?
Have some shame!

688
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,560
Stop torturing us everyday
with your videos

689
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,720
Who do you think you are?
Ms. World?

690
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,920
All guys will enjoy your videos
but no one will marry you

691
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,920
- Go help your mom and do some chores!
- Please have some decency

692
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,440
To hell with your dubsmash!

693
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,440
Ma'am should we continue or...

694
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,280
- It's ok
- Ok?

695
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,640
It's ok. Let's continue.
I'm fine

696
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,440
Let talk to the next caller.
Hello, greetings

697
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,920
Hello! Who is the guy
who spoke before me?

698
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,680
How dare he call her jobless.
Like he has better jobs!

699
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,960
Not everyone can talk sweet like you

700
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,120
How many can express
with eyes like you do?

701
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,240
Anyone who cannot appreciate your
beauty and skill has no taste at all

702
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,560
You got millions of viewers. Doesn't
it show how much they like your video?

703
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,400
Guy will enjoy you video
but not marry you?

704
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,960
The right guy will find you

705
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,360
Doesn't matter how he is but he'll
definitely be a charming fellow!

706
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,800
Don't pay heed to mongrels
like the last caller

707
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,160
You continue and keep
doing dubsmash as always

708
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,440
We, your fans are here
who enjoy what you do

709
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,720
Anyway, superb bro! By the
way, what's your name?

710
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,080
Well...err... my name...

711
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,960
Look, Dub-sis! Dub-sis!

712
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,720
Shut up!

713
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,160
Get lost!

714
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,440
Dub-sis?

715
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:03,480
"Oh my love, you attract
me like the gravity"

716
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,080
"And now you've become a part of me"

717
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:15,360
"Nice and slow like the roots,
your love's taking over me"

718
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,640
"My heart is filled with your love"

719
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:24,120
"Dancing and romancing through the
screen, you mesmerize me"

720
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,760
"Like the rainfall during twilight, you
appeared like an angel on the street"

721
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,920
"You are the drug that takes me high"

722
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,480
"Your sweet and sparky words
make me fly above the sky"

723
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,720
"I will create a world of our own"

724
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,960
"A place where no one else can go"

725
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,240
"I will create a world of our own"

726
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,600
"A place where no one else can go"

727
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,320
What business do you have
with that bottle picker?

728
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,160
He is not like what you judge.
He'll soon fly abroad for work

729
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,840
That's what they will tell you

730
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,680
To hell with that stink face!
They are rogues

731
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,680
They'll do anything for money

732
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,400
They earn peanuts and
wander around like rogues

733
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,480
If I find you meeting him again then I
won't be responsible for my actions

734
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,720
Why is she so quiet?

735
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,800
Are you upset?

736
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,040
Talk! That's what makes
you more beautiful

737
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,800
Say something. Silence
doesn't suit you

738
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Just spit out
whatever is your mind

739
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,720
When will you fly abroad?

740
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,120
Why this question out of the blue?

741
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,760
Well, can't you do some
other job until then?

742
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,840
What happened?

743
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,280
My mom saw you
collecting bottles...

744
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,920
Does it look cheap?

745
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,640
No. Nothing like that

746
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,040
I knew it! Suddenly my
dressing will be cheap...

747
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,880
then my work will be cheap and
soon I too will appear cheap

748
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,920
I didn't mean it that way

749
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,040
Will you never judge
humans by their quality?

750
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
So, an individual's dress and
work is what you judge them with?

751
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,400
Told you, I didn't mean it that way

752
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,840
Looks like you'll
love only the rich

753
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,600
Why are you talking
unnecessarily?

754
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,920
People around me keep distance
because they feel I'm dirty

755
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,880
I never felt bad then but now
when you did the same...

756
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,360
I didn't mean it that way

757
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Are you mad?

758
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,960
Never show me your face again

759
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,520
Kaaka wait!

760
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,320
You might have committed suicide
if you were in my place

761
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,280
No way!

762
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,800
Tell me, what did she say?

763
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,200
She literally asked how she could love
a boy who pick bottles for living

764
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,040
Forget it

765
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,440
Even I'm not getting a bride
because I work in a bar

766
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,400
Did I quit trying?

767
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,760
Didn't I keep trying continuously?

768
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,680
If not her then some other girl.
Keep trying

769
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Someone will fall for you

770
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Speak something according to your age!

771
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,440
Keeping talking like this...

772
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,040
and you'll be single not
at 35 but even at 45!

773
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,560
Shut up!

774
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,440
What's your point?

775
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,600
Stop it you glutton!

776
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,040
It's all because of you!

777
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,880
My gravy!

778
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,280
Sounds ridiculous!

779
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,800
We have been asking you for long!

780
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,360
To get us a job in your bar

781
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,640
It's not like we asked
something out of your reach

782
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,720
Did you at least give it a try?

783
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,920
Can't you even do this for us?

784
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,040
All you're worried is about
your marriage and happiness

785
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,600
But just forgot
about us, isn't it?

786
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Stop it! You want a job
in the bar, right?

787
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,680
Come on. Stop talking
like it's a big deal

788
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,040
"62...86..."

789
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,120
Accounts are not tallying

790
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
Not a new thing

791
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,200
What is the matter?

792
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,880
Boys who pick bottles are
asking for a job here

793
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,000
They are trustworthy

794
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,040
They'll obey us

795
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,280
But there is no job vacancy in our bar

796
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,200
Ok. Do they know to drive truck?

797
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,880
Yes, they do

798
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,480
Ask them to come

799
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,640
Guys, come here

800
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,800
Greetings boss

801
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,960
Need to get liquor from Pondicherry.
Can you do it?

802
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,280
Any job in the bar?

803
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,520
You can earn more in
the transport than bar

804
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,160
Agree to it

805
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
What is it? Can
you do it or not?

806
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Say yes

807
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,440
We don't have much time

808
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,960
Boss...

809
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,080
Hello!

810
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,680
Pandia, we need driver
starting tomorrow

811
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,760
Talk to them and let me know

812
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,240
I am going to market,
take care until then

813
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,840
- Ok boss
- Tell me

814
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,920
Weren't you pestering me for a job?

815
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,360
Now what's stopping you?

816
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,280
What's the problem in going to Pondicherry?

817
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,800
- Sounds good
- But it'd be better if job is in the bar

818
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,040
He promised us a better salary!

819
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,880
Bro, we're ok with it

820
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,000
Come on.
Let's take it up

821
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,600
Good! Thanks for getting
us the desired job!

822
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,800
Why is he behaving so strange?

823
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
Now, go find a job in
the collector's office!

824
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Stop! Don't you start now

825
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,280
Chinna, go to Pondicherry at once

826
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,600
Go to Sea Shore bar around 7 PM

827
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,560
A foreigner will come there

828
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,120
I have sent your photo to him

829
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,040
He will give you an electronic
chip in the size of sim card

830
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,080
Collect it from him and keep it very safe

831
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,720
Got it?

832
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,600
This is a very important matter

833
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,640
Sir, as ordered I went
to collect the chip

834
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,760
At the same time one of Dhandapani's
men came there with police

835
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,400
What happened to chip?

836
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,800
Chip is safe

837
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,520
Careful, Dhandapani
might cause us trouble

838
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,600
We must not spare him

839
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,840
Sir, I will finish
him once and for all

840
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,640
We cannot take risk in this matter

841
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,560
If anything leaks out...

842
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,120
...my whole life will be uprooted

843
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,720
Keep the chip safe

844
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,040
Call up Sekar

845
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,080
I will call you back with a plan in hand

846
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,840
Tell him

847
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,120
Kaaka, this is good opportunity

848
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,640
If we miss this...

849
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,040
...then we'll be fools!

850
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,080
You're actually talking
like a fool now

851
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,960
Think, what if we get caught?

852
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,400
That'll be end of our life

853
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,000
Why are you so scared?

854
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,120
Don't you know about Murugan?

855
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,720
He has got good connections
with the police

856
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,680
How do you think he
in this for so long?

857
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,080
Remember the day constable asked one of
his men to surrender to keep in custody?

858
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,280
Did you forget how
Murugan responded?

859
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,920
If we go to Pondicherry and
do the assigned job correctly...

860
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,680
he will pay us in full without deducting

861
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,000
Why is she coming here?

862
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,240
Dude, calm down

863
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,720
Now watch what I'm gonna do to her

864
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,360
- Hey! Stop! Listen to me
- Hey! Stop!

865
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,320
Why is she here?

866
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,320
Stop shouting?

867
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,840
Dude, calm down

868
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,480
Pandian told me everything

869
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,200
You don't have to drive to Pondicherry

870
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,720
I will give you the money and
you focus on your abroad plans!

871
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,440
Come again?

872
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,480
You'll give money?

873
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,240
Who asked you?

874
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,960
Do you think we are beggars?

875
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,720
We know how to reach
foreign and earn

876
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,160
- Dude
- Shut up!

877
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,840
Until now I was skeptical
about going to Pondicherry

878
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,200
But now I'm saying this

879
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,320
We are taking up the job!

880
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,920
For sure!

881
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,000
Let's get started

882
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,240
Awesome Urulai!

883
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,520
- Look, he left
- Kaaka!

884
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,480
- Sir
- Sit down

885
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,920
Stop it with your formalities

886
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,760
Dhandapani will be boozing with his
friends in his Koovathur warehouse

887
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,280
A lot of vehicles will carry
liquor and food for that party

888
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,000
Okay

889
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,400
One among that vehicles...

890
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,880
should be sent by us

891
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,080
Chinna, send fake currencies
along with liquors in that

892
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,520
Sekar, now your part

893
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,400
The moment that vehicle
enters the warehouse...

894
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,560
go inside with press people
and arrest Dhandapani

895
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,280
Sir, Sir one question sir, Sir

896
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Sir...sir...

897
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,960
Sekar...!

898
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,880
Looks like you are hesitant?

899
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,400
Well, sir...

900
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,480
Rs.5 billion is the target
fixed for liquor sale

901
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,000
Hence to avoid smuggling
of illicit liquors

902
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,120
they have formed a team
under AC Rajaram to monitor

903
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,000
- So...
- So what?

904
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,960
So smuggling liquor along with
fake currencies, at this hour...

905
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,880
is quite a risk

906
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,240
The whole police department
is in our palms!

907
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,120
You don't know about Rajaram.
He is different

908
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,080
Can't you find out when
he'll come for rounds?

909
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,280
I will get that information

910
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,240
Then what?

911
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,320
There is something more important

912
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,840
So just do what we say

913
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,720
Ok sir

914
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,640
This must be the
headlines tomorrow

915
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,600
New boys are coming today
to collect the liquor

916
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,720
They are orphans

917
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,440
Wait!

918
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,160
Where to?

919
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,160
Veerampatnam?

920
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,360
Get in. Get in

921
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,040
Come on

922
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,560
No one will question if
anything happens to them

923
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,680
Just now Murugan told me over phone

924
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,560
Your passports are here

925
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,280
That's awesome!

926
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,040
Our passports have arrived

927
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,040
That's great

928
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,120
Go, load the truck

929
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,840
Start quickly

930
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,040
Done with loading?

931
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,800
Yes. Done

932
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,120
Give me all your phone

933
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,040
For what?

934
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,640
For security purposes

935
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,120
Once you unload the
stuff in Chennai...

936
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,440
you will get back your phone.
Now, give it

937
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,640
I will ask them unload
some liquor in Koovathur

938
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,600
Unload six boxes from the
back at Koovathur

939
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,440
- Koovathur?
- Yes

940
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,640
Our owner didn't mention
anything about this

941
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,320
I spoke to your owner

942
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,520
He has agreed to pay
you Rs.2000 more

943
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,360
One of my men will follow them

944
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,080
You will keep getting information
about their whereabouts

945
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,400
Once the truck enters the warehouse

946
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,040
thrash the boys before
even they could speak

947
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,360
Then arrest them along with Dhandapani

948
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,960
What  are you are thinking?

949
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,320
Well...

950
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,160
no one has ever come out
after getting in to Koovathur

951
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,600
But then...

952
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,240
What if the boys reveal our
name us once they get caught?

953
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,600
The boys will never open their mouth

954
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,480
Even if they do...

955
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,640
Keep this visting card

956
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,760
Tell you work for Dhandapani
if asked at the gates

957
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,560
Ok, chief

958
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,320
Now, leave

959
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,200
Knock down the boys...

960
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,080
and arrest Dhandapani

961
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,320
Sir, truck has started from here

962
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,320
Boys should reach here on time

963
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,080
Ok? Keep me posted

964
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,800
Finally we landed a job
that we were looking for

965
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,360
Complete this trip without any issues...

966
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,640
and we will be on our way abroad

967
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,120
Did he seriously promise
Rs.300,000 for this single trip?

968
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,480
Like they are gonna pay so much.
The deal is for just Rs. 10,000

969
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,400
Holy guacamole.
Only 10,000?

970
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,120
It's too less

971
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,680
10,000 per trip means...

972
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,600
how many trips before we earn 300,000?

973
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,000
Three trips?

974
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,640
Thirty trips!

975
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,360
Oh my God!

976
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,400
Why didn't boss, Murugan inform
us before about Koovathur?

977
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,600
No idea

978
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,760
Dude! Dude! Stop here

979
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,920
Look, there is a restaurant

980
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,160
Yes. Slow down. Stop

981
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,560
Come on

982
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,760
Why did you guys stop midway?

983
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,040
- Who are you?
- Answer me first!

984
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,040
We took a break to eat.
Who are you?

985
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,920
This is why chief Dhandapani
asked me to follow you

986
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,200
Can't we even buy food?

987
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,920
Buy your food and start quickly

988
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,280
I said, start!

989
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,920
Stop staring!

990
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,800
Keep moving

991
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,760
Next stop, Koovathur! Got it!

992
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,280
Don't these guys
ever feel hungry?

993
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,520
What's with raising hands on us?

994
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,120
They are not even letting us eat

995
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,720
I suspected when he
grabbed the phone from us

996
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,160
Look, I lifted the phone

997
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,080
Awesome! Call Pandin first

998
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,120
Tell me, have you
got the liquor?

999
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Yes. We collected it

1000
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,760
But one guy is following us

1001
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,200
Following you? Who is he?

1002
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,800
He claims to work for some Dhandapani

1003
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,080
Fools!

1004
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,600
He is our owner's enemy

1005
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,520
They are just waiting for an
opportunity to get us caught

1006
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,160
Don't listen to him

1007
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,320
Escape from him and
come to the bar

1008
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,400
Understood? Going abroad
is more important

1009
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,880
I have boasted a lot
about you to the owner

1010
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,400
- Don't mess it up
- Ok bro

1011
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,960
We will come to our bar at once

1012
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,720
Drive faster!

1013
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,560
Let's go!

1014
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,320
Don't be scared

1015
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,280
We got this

1016
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,920
Dude, what are you doing?
I need the gravy!

1017
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,080
- Please don't waste it
- Hit him right on the face!

1018
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,200
Get him!

1019
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,760
Let's do as Pandian said
and not go to Koovathur

1020
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,080
Yes. Let's take the Thindivanam route

1021
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,680
Left! Left! Turn left!

1022
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,880
- Stop! Stop the truck!
- Dude, it's him again! Drive fast!

1023
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,400
I said, turn! Turn around

1024
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,400
Drive faster Kaaka

1025
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,920
Keep going! Faster!

1026
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,280
- Faster! He is getting closer!
- Don't worry!

1027
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,240
Can't you hear me? Turn around!

1028
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,200
I said, turn around!

1029
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,960
Game over!

1030
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,480
Take the motor
cycle and go ahead

1031
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,920
Come back if you face sense problem.
Come on

1032
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,800
Sir, the boys escaped

1033
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,720
Truck is going through Dhindivanam city route

1034
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,320
You!

1035
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,000
they knocked me down
and took my bike

1036
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,960
Do you show up to
put me in a mess?

1037
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,200
Can't you handle three boys?

1038
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,560
- Sir, I...
- Hang up!

1039
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,160
- Hello
- Sir?

1040
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,680
Three boys will cross
your check post soon

1041
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,840
- Ok sir
- One is in bike

1042
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,840
Followed by two in a 207 model truck

1043
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
That bike and 207 should
not pass your check post

1044
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,440
Go, check if a bike and
a 207 truck is coming

1045
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,680
- Sir, any issue?
- Diver, let's go

1046
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,840
Stop!

1047
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,640
Stop! Stop!

1048
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,240
Stop! Can't you hear me? Stop!

1049
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,560
- Sir, what happened?
- Uh-oh! We're caught

1050
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,640
Park aside! Now! Do it!

1051
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,360
Kneel down!

1052
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,240
- Where are you friends?
- Can't you hear him?

1053
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,760
Answer us and we'll leave you.
Understand?

1054
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,760
Get in! Get in!

1055
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,920
Samy, come here!

1056
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,560
Come here!

1057
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,320
What is it, chief?

1058
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,320
Who came in last here?

1059
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,960
Arumugam was cleaning this room

1060
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,560
You! Come here!

1061
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,680
Where is the bottle
which was in my room?

1062
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,760
I didn't take it Sir

1063
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,400
Don't you lie. I have
everything recorded in CCTV

1064
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,600
- I swear. I didn't
- Don't lie

1065
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,760
Go, get the laptop!

1066
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,360
Hey! Stop! Hey, stop!

1067
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,920
- I said, stop!
- Careful dude!

1068
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,080
I said, stop!

1069
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,160
Guy, stop the truck!

1070
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200
- He is nearing us! There he is
- Let go of me!

1071
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,160
He got me! Pull me back! Pull me in!

1072
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,520
How dare you?

1073
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,080
Drive faster! Fast!

1074
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,680
- Hey! Hey stop!
- Faster! Drive faster!

1075
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,920
- I said, stop!
- Let go of me! Leave me!

1076
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,520
He fell off! Keep going! Drive!

1077
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,160
Now, who is he?

1078
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,320
One of Murugan's boy

1079
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,720
I got their mobile
but he followed me

1080
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,120
Stupid mongrels!

1081
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,440
Pick up the call, Sekar!
Sekar pick up the phone!

1082
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,120
Something is fishy, dude

1083
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,160
We took another route because
someone was following us

1084
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,000
but in that route the
cops are waiting for us

1085
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,680
Something smells fishy to me!

1086
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,160
Let us go

1087
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,360
Tell him

1088
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,240
Let's quit this and leave

1089
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,080
Shut up! You should
have thought before

1090
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,360
Now we have got in to this

1091
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,280
whatever happens we must reach
Chennai with the liquor in tact

1092
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,600
Police again!

1093
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,480
- Get down you guys!
- Quick. He is coming

1094
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
- Drive! Drive! Come on!
- Quick, start and follow them!

1095
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,720
Drive faster!
Come on!

1096
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,000
- Drive! Faster!
- Come on, faster

1097
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,040
Faster! Faster!

1098
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,960
Keep going straight... straight!

1099
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,320
Don't stop! Keep moving!

1100
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,400
Go! Go! Straight!

1101
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,680
Don't stop
Keep going

1102
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,440
Going dude

1103
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,640
Block them

1104
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,840
Take reverse!

1105
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,960
Reverse! Reverse!

1106
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,640
How long will you make us chase you?
Can't you hear us?

1107
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,920
Come out! Come out, I said!

1108
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,640
How dare you play smart with me?

1109
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,680
Make sure everything is
in tact in the vehicle

1110
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,400
Sir, all the liquors
bottles are safe inside

1111
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,080
Who's bothered about that? Move!

1112
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,040
Everything is in tact

1113
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,080
Get the phone from boys

1114
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,880
Get inside the vehicle

1115
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,560
Kesavan, get in along with boys

1116
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,400
Go to Koovathur through ECR

1117
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,520
Hope you know Dhandapani's warehouse.
You get down a km ahead

1118
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,840
I will follow you

1119
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,200
Kesavan, switch off that walkie talkie

1120
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,720
The boys are getting a phone call !

1121
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,960
This is Chinna's number

1122
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,120
Why is he calling the boys?

1123
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,320
Boys, where are you?

1124
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,800
Listen to me!

1125
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,080
Return back!

1126
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,240
The police will catch you

1127
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,680
Hello

1128
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,960
Sekar, change in the plan

1129
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,600
Do not arrest the boys

1130
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,560
Do not call the media

1131
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,680
Stop everything at once

1132
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,840
Are you kidding me?

1133
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,200
First you'll ask me
to arrest the boys

1134
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,360
then you'll say don't arrest 'em

1135
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,240
and you'll directly call the
boys and asked them to escape

1136
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,480
Chinna, this is wrong

1137
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,760
What do you take me for?

1138
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,920
Sekar stop
blabbering...listen to me!

1139
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,280
I know very well about you!

1140
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,360
Only you want a good
place in minister's book

1141
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,680
Listen to me Sekar, there is a
serious matter in those boys' hands

1142
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,320
As per plan I will go to
Koovathur ware house!

1143
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,080
Stop me if you can

1144
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,360
- Listen to me! Listen!
- Hang up now!

1145
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,000
Sir...Sir...

1146
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,160
Go! Go! Go!

1147
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,600
Go! Go! Go!

1148
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,440
Blame me for sending
a dummy like you!

1149
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,080
They are planning to arrest us
along with liquors at Koovathur

1150
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,600
We cannot go back in the same
route because of the police

1151
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,520
That is why I'm telling.
Forget abroad job also

1152
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,160
Let's leave the truck
here and escape

1153
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,520
Liquor must be safe and
we must also escape

1154
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,720
The only way to escape is to
unhook that policeman behind

1155
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,400
Get down and remove the blanker in the back

1156
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,000
Blanket?

1157
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,560
Remove I say! Fast!

1158
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,920
I will hide the vehicle and come

1159
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,520
Meanwhile you guys check how
the police vehicle goes

1160
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,560
- Go now
- Ok

1161
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,120
Isn't that the blanket
from boys' truck?

1162
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,560
Stop. Take a reverse

1163
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,320
Are they gone?

1164
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,480
They went that way.
Thanks God!

1165
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,120
Sir! Sir! Please don't beat us

1166
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,600
Where is the bottle?

1167
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,520
Where is the bottle? Tell me!

1168
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,200
Please! No!

1169
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,520
Here! All bottles are here, sir

1170
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,440
Are you kidding me?

1171
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,840
I'm talking about the
bottle you stole

1172
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:30,840
Show me!

1173
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,160
Get me that!

1174
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,200
What bottle was that?

1175
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,080
It looked good and so I stole it

1176
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:53,680
Sir...

1177
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,760
What's the status, Chinna?

1178
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,040
Sir, there was a small issue

1179
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,480
A small issue?

1180
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,440
You are messing with
20 billion here!

1181
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:00,960
Sir, well...

1182
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,680
- I must get that bottle safely
- Don't worry, sir. It's with me

1183
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,040
I will be there in two hours

1184
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,160
- There, he is coming again
- Get in the jeep!

1185
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,280
Get in to the truck! Go!

1186
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,680
Not one or two, 20
billion is in stake here

1187
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,240
- Sekar, come quickly to Koovathur
- 20 billion?

1188
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,520
I have locked these boys

1189
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,680
The fake currencies are in tact

1190
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,680
As planned, arrest the
boys at Koovathur

1191
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,320
They should never step
out of prison for life

1192
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,840
Just do as I say

1193
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,280
Come on, guys!

1194
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,480
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1195
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,120
Come on, guys!

1196
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,240
Leave me

1197
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,680
Let's go

1198
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,600
Sir, fake currencies are here

1199
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,440
This is not my vehicle sir

1200
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,080
I see

1201
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,880
I have nothing to do with it

1202
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,000
Take that mobile phone

1203
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,440
Not this vehicle! Let's
go in that vehicle

1204
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,720
Call Pandian

1205
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,160
- Phone
- Here

1206
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,640
The phone is dead

1207
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,520
Damn it!

1208
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:56,640
- Listen
- Yes

1209
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,600
Take that walkie talkie

1210
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,600
Walkie talkie?

1211
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,600
Here you go

1212
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,760
In ECR...

1213
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,840
near Koovathur village, a 207 model
vehicle, number is PY 13 6762

1214
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,880
There are wads of fake currencies in it

1215
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,400
I don't know whose it is

1216
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,400
Sir

1217
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,360
Isn't this your jurisdiction?
Where were you?

1218
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,240
I was in rounds, sir.
Village...function...issues

1219
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,880
Come up with better story later

1220
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,040
For now, arrest him

1221
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,760
Sekar!

1222
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,640
There is no use of arresting me

1223
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,760
I will be bailed out
tomorrow morning itself

1224
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,120
You will be the one in trouble

1225
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,560
Watch out!

1226
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,640
Sir, Chinna got arrested for
carrying fake currencies

1227
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,120
Sekar, those boys
escaped in my jeep!

1228
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,080
There is a bottle in that vehicle.
It is very important

1229
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,440
- Last night, in the Pondicherry
- Chennai stretch...

1230
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,120
near Koovathur, a man
identified as Chinna...

1231
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,120
was caught red handed with duplicate
liquors and fake currencies

1232
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,760
For the act of negligence and
failing to do his duty...

1233
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,200
the local inspector,
Sekar has been suspended

1234
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,280
It is said that accused in fake currency
case, Chinna is connected to you

1235
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,640
This is your ignorance
and indecency!

1236
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,680
So, Chinna is not your henchman?

1237
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,080
I have never even heard that name

1238
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,720
This incident took place near
by Dhandapani's warehouse

1239
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,080
Instead of questioning him...

1240
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,960
Look, Chinna is the one arrested

1241
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
The right hand of the stare minister,
Rajamanickam. So, go question him

1242
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,000
First stop pointing the mic at ruling
party for every incident out there

1243
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,440
Like it's a clean government. Corruption,
abduction and tyranny is all that is happening

1244
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,920
The government and the
ministry is behind all this

1245
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,640
All these days he was just barking

1246
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,680
Now he has started biting!

1247
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,920
I'll be at peace
only if I kill him!

1248
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,840
No sir. There is no chance that
Dhandapani might know about the bottle

1249
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,800
Please don't make any hasty decision.
Even a scratch on Dhandapani...

1250
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,600
will push media's attention to you

1251
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,320
I don't care! I need that
bottle as soon as possible!

1252
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,840
I will go to any extreme for that!

1253
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,160
Chinna told me that he had
kept the bottle in his jeep

1254
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,160
Those boys escaped with the jeep

1255
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,600
Catch the boys and we'll get it

1256
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,520
They why in the hell have you
arrested Chinna instead of the boys?

1257
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,600
Rajaram intervened at the moment

1258
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,880
Aiyo! You guys have totally
messed everything up!

1259
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,360
Make it fast

1260
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,760
Ramesh, come fast

1261
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,520
- Did you get the CCTV footage?
- Yes sir

1262
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,640
Check it and let me know

1263
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,520
Hello, boss...

1264
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,160
There was a major issue when
the boys were returning

1265
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,480
You must help them somehow

1266
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,840
Innocent guys. There
is no fault of theirs

1267
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,720
Yes, I did get a call.
I got to know everything

1268
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,760
Ask the boys to come down. I'll take
care of the issue, no matter what

1269
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,720
I'll come there at once

1270
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,760
Ok boss

1271
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,920
Sir, the CCTV footage
are all deleted

1272
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,080
They say that CCTV
wasn't functioning

1273
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,520
Ram, step outside...

1274
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:36,360
and check if any of the neighboring or
opposite buildings has CCTV focused here

1275
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,160
We need the details the
vehicles that came in here

1276
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,520
What's behind all that?

1277
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,720
Ask them to clear it, at once!

1278
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,160
Sir, he is Chinna

1279
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,400
A native of Chennai

1280
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,760
Spends half of his
time in Pondicherry

1281
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,920
He does duplicate liquor business and
sells them in Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu

1282
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,080
Apart from that he does real estate,
off court settlements and rowdyism

1283
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,640
Yet, there is not even a single
charges pressed against him

1284
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:16,400
Minister of industrial
development, Rajamanickam

1285
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,400
What's the use in both of us
sharing this information?

1286
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,760
We need proof if we must
take it up to court

1287
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,040
People believe in him

1288
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:28,400
Sir, minister is carrying out all his
illegal activities in a very secret way

1289
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,720
He is an expert in it and he
has taught Chinna the same

1290
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,400
So far Chinna hasn't been
trapped in any case

1291
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,560
But he is trapped in this and that means
this not just fake currency issue

1292
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,560
There is something really big behind it

1293
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,600
I think he must have gone
against the minister

1294
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,480
Or else minister's enemy must
have planned and trapped him

1295
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,240
-  May be, sir
- One second

1296
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:54,880
Yes, sir

1297
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,160
Ok, sir

1298
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,200
This case is moving to the CBI

1299
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,520
We need to provide all
the history we have

1300
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,840
Sir, this is too early

1301
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,600
Why do you say so?

1302
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,200
Sir, as far as this
case is concerned...

1303
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,080
the CBI will look into as only
fake currencies case

1304
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,080
Chinna will turn himself
in and go to prison

1305
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,160
Mr. Rajamanickam will escape easily

1306
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:19,440
If must collect all the evidences again
Mr. Rajamanickam's illegal activities...

1307
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,280
then I must conducted a
special inquiry on Chinna

1308
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,600
I need your permission for that

1309
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,480
Do you think Chinna will open his mouth?

1310
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,600
Chinna won't open his mouth

1311
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,160
We must make him

1312
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,200
It's difficult to
bail out Chinna, sir

1313
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,640
Before handing over Chinna to the CBI...

1314
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,760
Rajaram is going to investigate him
under his custody for three days

1315
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,400
Sir, if Rajaram gets the custody of
Chinna then it's not good for us

1316
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,280
He is Chinna! He won't utter a word!

1317
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,680
Investigating is Mr. Rajaram. He knows
to pull the truth and also bend it

1318
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,920
First, you go catch those boys!

1319
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,200
I'll handle Chinna's matter

1320
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,360
Go along with him

1321
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,400
Hello

1322
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,840
Kaaka's phone is switched off

1323
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,160
Did they return from Pondicherry?

1324
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,640
No. They got into a
problem after going there

1325
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,200
- They'll come back soon
- A problem?

1326
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,280
What happened?

1327
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,920
I wanna meet Kaaka, at once!

1328
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,960
I don't know where he is. I'll
let you know once he comes

1329
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,520
Look there is one man

1330
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,160
Where's Pandia?

1331
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,040
- Who are you?
- Where's Pandia?

1332
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,880
Where's Pandia?

1333
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,760
Where is Pandia? Can't you answer?

1334
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,440
Who are you?

1335
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,520
First, answer me!

1336
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,240
Answer me!
Can't you hear me?

1337
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,400
What's the truth?

1338
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,400
I knew your friendship with
those kids will lead to here

1339
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,960
All you do is bride
hunting along with them

1340
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,280
You better tell where those boys are

1341
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,400
I swear, I don't know

1342
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,040
No use requesting him

1343
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,000
Damn it!

1344
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:01,920
Hold on. Dear, call up the
boys and ask them to come here

1345
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:02,920
Sir...

1346
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,320
they don't have their phones

1347
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,920
We can talk to them
only if they call me

1348
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,800
Is it? Then keep your
phone on the table

1349
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,440
Do it!

1350
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:14,960
Must be the boys, right?

1351
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,960
Ask them where they are and
when they'll come here

1352
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,040
Instead if you alert them...

1353
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,480
Go ahead

1354
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,400
- Talk!
- You heard him!

1355
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,560
- Talk!
- Hello

1356
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,680
Hello, it's me dear son-in-law

1357
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,920
My daughter is adamant that
she will marry only you

1358
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,600
Working at a government
bar isn't so bad!

1359
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,360
My daughter and myself are
coming down to meet you

1360
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,160
I hope you'll be at the bar

1361
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,160
- Sir
- Dear, son-in-law...

1362
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,480
Come on, I just gave
you a happy news

1363
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,440
Why are you silent like
a rat stuck on a trap?

1364
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,720
Wondering how my daughter looks?

1365
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,760
She looks like the deity
Mahalakshmi in Yellow Saree

1366
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,800
Do you really need this?

1367
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,320
Bride hunting, his highness?

1368
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,240
If the boys don't turn up...

1369
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,280
...it'll be lying down in a single piece

1370
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:05,480
Can only be fed to crows!

1371
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,800
Thiru, get the phone from others

1372
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,720
- Guys, give your phones!
- You heard it. Give it!

1373
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,080
He'll finish you off

1374
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,640
Look guys...

1375
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,880
everyone mind your own business

1376
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,440
Shut up and work. Go!

1377
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,960
- Move! Move!
- Leave!

1378
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,280
- Vijay...
- Sir?

1379
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,720
- I want two guys in the street corner
- Ok sir

1380
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:23,035
<b>www.1TamilMV.live</b><br/>

1381
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,600
- Message me at once you see them
- Ok sir

1382
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,440
Thiru, park all the bikes inside

1383
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:25,800
Ok chief

1384
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,320
Those boys are quite clever

1385
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,160
They will escape the moment
the smell anything fishy

1386
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:30,920
- Ok
- Careful

1387
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,440
- Guys, park your bikes inside
- Come on! Come

1388
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,120
Mr. Groom...

1389
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,480
Why are you standing here?
Go there and act strange

1390
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,640
I said, go!

1391
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:40,960
Go

1392
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:42,600
Listen...

1393
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,400
take a step outside the bar and...

1394
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,040
Go!

1395
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:47,960
Now, go!

1396
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,120
Next. Your name?

1397
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:53,640
Pandi, sir

1398
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,040
Go, sit over there

1399
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,240
Sir!

1400
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,560
Tell me

1401
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:12,640
What?

1402
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,160
Man!

1403
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,000
Chinna who arrested last night for carrying
duplicate liquor and fake currencies...

1404
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,240
was found dead under mysterious
condition in Puzhal prison

1405
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,920
This incident took place when AC Rajaram
was there to take Chinna in his custody

1406
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,160
Rajaram has passes an order to investigate
the prisoners and cops in that prison

1407
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,800
This incident has complicated the case

1408
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:36,320
It is said that Chinna was a very close
ally of ruling party minister, Rajamanickam

1409
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,440
They finished off Chinna?

1410
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,680
So the boys are doomed!

1411
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,520
Look. It's those guys

1412
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,680
The boys are here! Come on!

1413
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,720
- Come on!
- Muruga, be where you are

1414
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,240
- Come on
- Pandia...

1415
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,880
The boys are coming.
Try to help them and...

1416
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,360
Now, go...

1417
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,000
Some of you go back

1418
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:26,840
Get them!

1419
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,400
Run! Run! Run!

1420
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,160
Come on, guys!

1421
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,160
Quick!

1422
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,160
Bro...Go!

1423
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,000
Rickshaw! Rickshaw!

1424
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,080
To the railway gate

1425
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:05,880
Go!

1426
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,360
Are they gone?

1427
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,640
Excuse me, where is the
government bar here?

1428
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,720
Father-in-law...

1429
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,560
Is someone still looking for us?

1430
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,720
All these days I was looking for one but
first time someone's looking for me

1431
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,320
Who is looking for you?

1432
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,880
My father-in-law

1433
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:29,800
You set out like a brave heart and
promised to return with those boys?

1434
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,480
I know you won't be even
able to near those boys!

1435
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,800
I wonder how you made through
the police selection

1436
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,080
- We'll nab them, sir
- My foot!

1437
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,520
You let the escape twice!
Stop giving false promises

1438
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,120
Useless!

1439
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:49,360
If I trust you further, then I'm
the biggest fool on this earth!

1440
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,760
I must have finished you off
for the mess you have made

1441
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,080
Unfortunately, Chinna
had to be finished off

1442
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,200
I feel like I lost a hand!

1443
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,720
Get lost! Go, try using your police
power and see if you can still succeed!

1444
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,600
Until then don't show me your face!

1445
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,040
- You
- Yes, sir

1446
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,880
- Go, get Murugan
- Ok sir

1447
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,160
Don't leave him until we
get hold of those boys

1448
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,520
They thrashed a bachelor
like very badly

1449
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,080
But for what?

1450
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,240
Asking about the
whereabouts of you three

1451
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,800
Bro, what's our fault?

1452
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,080
We are innocent

1453
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,160
No one will believe you

1454
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,080
If this is my plight for
being your friend...

1455
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,760
imagine what they'll
do to you guys

1456
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,320
How did the owner let
that police thrash you?

1457
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,520
Owner? He was the one who brought
both the cop and the thugs

1458
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,600
They are running
wild like chameleons

1459
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,760
If they get us,
they'll rip us apart!

1460
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,640
Come, let's go to the hospital

1461
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,960
For what? Get our autopsy done?

1462
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,320
How about we get someone's help?

1463
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,080
Tell me who's that someone?

1464
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,640
And ask for what help?

1465
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,320
Will you tell 'em about
the smuggled liquor?

1466
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,080
Or about the fake currencies?

1467
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,240
Or about the breaking
the check post?

1468
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,080
Stop blabbering without
knowing what's going on

1469
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,800
So, what do we do now?

1470
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,480
Abscond to some faraway place

1471
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:17,800
To where?

1472
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,680
Like you always
wished for, go abroad

1473
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,960
Are you kidding?

1474
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,160
Tell me, are you kidding?

1475
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,880
You can't live here and escape
from the cops and minister's thugs

1476
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,600
Foreign sounds safe

1477
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,800
I ain't Vijaya Mallaya
to escape to foreign

1478
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,880
Who's that Malliga?

1479
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,440
Going foreign sounds safe

1480
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,160
We don't even have money
to travel by train

1481
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,320
Don't worry

1482
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,800
I have some money
saved for my wedding

1483
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,440
I'll give that to travel
agent, Mani and...

1484
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,160
ask him speed up the process

1485
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,560
If we fall short,
let's take loan

1486
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,240
You saved it for your wedding

1487
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,200
That's fine

1488
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,400
Stay safe around here
until the job is done

1489
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,920
Don't go anywhere. They'll
skin you alive if they get you

1490
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,480
Sir, Rajaram got Murugan
before we could get him

1491
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,440
Chinna is the one who
sells liquor to the liquor shop

1492
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,160
He'll pay me a commission
if I sell his liquor

1493
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,680
That's all, sir

1494
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,480
Link between the minister
and government bars?

1495
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,360
I swear, I have no
idea about it, sir

1496
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,840
What about the boys?

1497
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:31,160
Sekar was sent along with
me to nab those boys

1498
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:36,120
The news of Chinna's death and boys arrival
created a commotion and they escaped

1499
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,840
Any link between Dhandapani
and these boys?

1500
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,120
No link, sir

1501
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,040
What is it, Pandia?

1502
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,200
Here, have this

1503
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,920
What's all this, Pandia?

1504
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:03,760
Here

1505
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,920
You may have all the money

1506
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,120
Those boys must fly
abroad, somehow

1507
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,480
Here, have this too

1508
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,040
They won't be allowed to live here

1509
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,200
Please, somehow send the abroad

1510
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:31,880
Sir...

1511
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,920
these are the boys who were bringing
the truck with which Chinna was caught

1512
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,880
Sir, here the photo of those boys

1513
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,560
Nab those boys!

1514
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,120
We must nab those
boys before Rajaram!

1515
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,440
Nab these boys, first

1516
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,280
Where are those boys?

1517
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,880
Sir, they aren't here

1518
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,720
Check inside!

1519
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:03,840
You check outside!

1520
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,880
Have you these boys anywhere?

1521
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,640
Where do they live?

1522
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,520
Sir, they are orphans

1523
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,600
They are not in here

1524
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,240
They're neither here

1525
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,800
The are regular here but it's
been four days since I saw them

1526
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,600
You don't know their
background or their home...

1527
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,080
then why do you hire them?

1528
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,120
Sir, I swear I don't
know anything about them

1529
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,360
One among them, Kaaka,
he speaks Ceylon Tamil

1530
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,080
Ceylon Tamil?

1531
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,400
Ok, leave

1532
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,880
Have any of you seen
these boys anywhere?

1533
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,680
- No, sir
- Ceylon Tamilan

1534
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,320
- No idea, sir
- No, sir

1535
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,280
Sir?

1536
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,320
If they come here,
I must get the call first

1537
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:39,960
Ok sir

1538
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,960
There, Pandian is back

1539
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,360
What happened, bro?

1540
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:54,600
Here

1541
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,360
- New dress for wearing tomorrow
- For what?

1542
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,440
You three are flying
tomorrow morning

1543
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,280
Thanks, bro

1544
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,200
One of his Travel's van will come
to airport, early at 7:30 for a drop

1545
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,360
He will send the passport and
visa along with the driver

1546
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,560
Flight time?

1547
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,400
Ten 'O clock

1548
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,560
To which country?

1549
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,360
- Dubai
- Dubai? Whoa!

1550
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:15,960
Thanks a lot, bro

1551
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,240
Thanks a lot, Pandian

1552
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,400
This is what we were
waiting for all these days

1553
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,800
You proved that you're
a kind hearted person!

1554
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,480
Fine. Cool.
Don't cry now

1555
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,880
I still can't believe
we are going to Dubai

1556
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,400
Everything will be fine.
Don't worry

1557
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,720
- Take care
- Ok

1558
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:29,920
Wait! Give me your phone

1559
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,880
What is it? Affection?

1560
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,360
Here you go

1561
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,560
Hello, it's me. Your
son-in-law's brother

1562
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,400
Well, we'll discuss
that in person

1563
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,240
Come with your daughter
to the airport

1564
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,480
Sharp at Seven 'O clock

1565
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,400
- Whom is he talking to?
- Not your daughter but our sister-in-law

1566
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,120
Yes, ask her to wear that Yellow Saree

1567
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:50,600
Yellow Saree?

1568
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,040
Whom are you talking to?

1569
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,160
- What happened?
- What are you up to?

1570
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,640
Aren't we allowed to
meet our sister-in-law?

1571
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,000
Do we really need all this
with the problems we got?

1572
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,600
We'll fly to Dubai only after
uniting you with your dream girl

1573
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,960
- How about that?
- Yeah!

1574
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,240
Of course, who else will
treat us when we visit you?

1575
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,560
Hence we are getting into our
sister-in-law's good book

1576
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,680
- You guys have a kind heart
- Who? Us?

1577
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:18,440
When everyone chased us away seeing our
dress, appearance and even for my slang

1578
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,440
Only you treated us like humans

1579
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,760
You have done so much for us but we
have hardly done anything for you

1580
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,640
He sounds very responsible
when talks like that

1581
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,880
Stop getting emotional and go, sleep

1582
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,320
- We'll meet later
- Ok

1583
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:33,960
Give me my phone

1584
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,160
I'll just see him from
a distance and leave

1585
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,440
Why do you wanna leave? You
too have helped with money

1586
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,720
Meet him and send them off

1587
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,280
No. He made the wrong decision of
going to Pondicherry after seeing me

1588
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,880
I don't wanna him to do something
stupid again. I'm worried

1589
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,000
Well, you do have a point

1590
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,080
If he loses his temper, he
will do something stupid

1591
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,240
They might come any minute.
I shall leave

1592
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,200
Ok dear

1593
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,960
Where are they?

1594
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,600
- Bro!
- Pandian, bro

1595
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,160
Didn't I ask you to wait here?
Where were you?

1596
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,520
We were upstairs

1597
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,760
Without tickets and passport?

1598
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,160
Behave knowing what
the situation is

1599
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,880
When will we get the tickets?

1600
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,880
He said he'll send it his
Travel's van by 7 - 7:30

1601
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,240
I guess, that must be the van

1602
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,280
- Yes, that must be the one
- Come on

1603
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,840
Come on

1604
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,120
Shut up and get inside

1605
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,720
- What's all this?
- Get inside! Go!

1606
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,560
I said, get in!

1607
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:35,640
Get in!

1608
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,120
Please don't hit them

1609
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,520
Speak up! How dare
you try to escape?

1610
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,480
Close the screens

1611
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,040
Father-in-law!

1612
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,760
I said, close it! Close it!

1613
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,800
Where is the bottle? Tell me!

1614
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:51,680
Which bottle?

1615
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:52,160
Don't act!

1616
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,840
The one you flicked
from Chinna's warehouse

1617
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,560
- Where is it?
- Stop hitting them, sir

1618
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,680
Come again, sir

1619
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,440
Stop hitting them?

1620
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:01,800
I thought you were the comedian but
you played the hero and helped them!

1621
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:03,680
I'll deal with you later

1622
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:04,680
Tell me. Where is the bottle?

1623
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,360
You want bottle, right? Come to
the warehouse. There are many

1624
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,400
Sarcasm? You filthy
bottle picker!

1625
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,160
We just escaped in the jeep.
We don't know anything else

1626
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,280
Where's the jeep?

1627
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,400
Where's the jeep? Answer me

1628
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,880
We left it on the way

1629
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,040
Where did you leave it?

1630
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,640
Do you remember the place?

1631
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,920
Stop the van

1632
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,880
All of you get down and follow us

1633
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,360
Bend! Don't you dare make noise

1634
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,040
I said, bend!

1635
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,400
Take a right! Right!

1636
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,120
Ok, sir

1637
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,320
Don't let him see us

1638
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,080
Get down, guys!

1639
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,320
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1640
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,160
How in the hell did you find such
a place and leave the jeep here?

1641
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,000
Keep moving!

1642
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:05,680
Move!

1643
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,320
You! Speak up!

1644
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,560
Move!

1645
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,480
- Guys, search!
- Ok

1646
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,440
Tell them if you  guys know

1647
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,680
I swear.
We don't know

1648
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,000
Where is the bottle?

1649
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,760
If you don't tell now...

1650
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,240
- Chief...
- We don’t know, sir

1651
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,400
There is a phone in this bag

1652
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,760
This is Chinna's phone

1653
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,120
It is dead

1654
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,440
Go and put it on charge

1655
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:39,760
Guys! Guys!

1656
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,440
Finally!

1657
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,800
We got it at last!

1658
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,720
Did they kill Chinna,
just for this bottle?

1659
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,440
Sir! Sir, please! Sir, let us go

1660
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,400
There is something more important

1661
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,760
So just do what we say

1662
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,360
Ok sir

1663
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:08,920
Chief, switched on the phone

1664
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,720
There is a bottle in it.
It's very important

1665
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,760
Now this is awesome.
Come here, you boys

1666
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,160
Go!

1667
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:40,960
Go!

1668
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:48,000
In a way it was good that
you guys escaped from me

1669
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:52,440
You guys are gonna
make me a millionaire

1670
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,160
Sir, please leave us

1671
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,560
- Kumar
- Yes, chief

1672
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,200
Tie them up and put
them in the vehicle

1673
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,120
You both follow us

1674
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,240
- Come on, now!
- Move!

1675
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,960
- Get inside!
- Get inside the van!

1676
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,960
- Move!
- Keep moving!

1677
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,560
Hold this

1678
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,240
Give me the phone

1679
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:32,320
Here...

1680
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
This is minister's number

1681
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,240
Call him up...

1682
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,280
Tell him that if he
needs the bottle...

1683
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,160
then you demand 20 million

1684
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,120
20 million?

1685
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,480
Not your money, right?
Go ahead! Do it!

1686
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:44,920
Please let these boys go

1687
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,560
They are innocent

1688
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,040
Don't push them
into any problem

1689
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,560
- Yes your highness
- I plead you!

1690
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,040
Stop it! Don't beat him!

1691
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,280
Please don't harm him

1692
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,400
Can't you see I'm talking?

1693
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,440
So shut up!

1694
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,400
Don't harm him!

1695
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,920
Utter a word and I
swear that'll be it!

1696
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,760
- Let us go!
- Leave us!

1697
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,400
Now, call the minister

1698
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,480
Kaaka! No!

1699
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,640
Kaaka, it will lead
to bigger problems

1700
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,000
Please don't beat him! Please!

1701
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:07,960
Shut up!

1702
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,040
You better do as I say

1703
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,400
- Kaaka
- Shut up!

1704
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,040
- Just don't do it!
- I said, shut up!

1705
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:16,960
Call up the minister

1706
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:17,880
Kaaka

1707
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:18,800
Do it!

1708
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,240
No matter what...

1709
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,240
do not call the minister!

1710
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,160
Call! Now!

1711
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,880
- Kaaka, no matter what! Don't do it!
- Make the call

1712
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,200
Don't obey him!

1713
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,680
Damn it! What's your problem?

1714
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,240
"We have no one"

1715
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,760
"Stop saying that you have no one"

1716
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,360
"I am here for you all"

1717
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,480
"Tomorrow morning's your flight"

1718
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,320
Grandpa, out! You're out!

1719
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,080
I am not out

1720
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,400
Why did you bowl
before I was ready?

1721
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,280
You keep doing cheating always!

1722
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,000
No! No! I'm not out. Let's
start afresh. Go, bowl

1723
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,480
- No! You're out!
- Sir, call for you

1724
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,240
Sir, can I talk to bottle?

1725
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,680
Can I talk to the minister?

1726
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,600
Who are you? How did
you get this number?

1727
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,840
What do you want?

1728
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,360
My identity is not
important here

1729
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,760
Ask him " Do you want the bottle?"

1730
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,160
My identity is not important here.
Do you want the bottle?

1731
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:45,760
Bottle?

1732
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,680
Do you know whom you
are talking to?

1733
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,400
Ask him if he wants the bottle
he is searching for or not?

1734
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,520
Do you want the bottle you
are searching for or not?

1735
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,440
How do I trust you have it?

1736
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,800
Tell him, you will send
the photo of the bottle

1737
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,000
I will send the
photo to your phone

1738
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,000
Show me. Properly!

1739
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,040
You are out, grandpa!

1740
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,840
Answer the call

1741
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:21,800
Hello

1742
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,040
20 million! Demand 20 million!

1743
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,160
I need 20 million

1744
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,280
Listen!

1745
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,760
Ok! Fine

1746
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:30,680
I will give

1747
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,200
Yes! Yes!

1748
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,040
Come to my home with the bottle

1749
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:35,880
No way!

1750
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,520
I cannot come to your home

1751
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:39,440
Tell him to bring the
money to where I say

1752
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,080
Tell him to bring the
money to where I say

1753
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:41,640
What?

1754
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,120
Tell him?

1755
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:44,920
I meant, I'm telling you

1756
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:45,880
Bring the money along

1757
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,000
You retard!

1758
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,040
See that? Cruel world! He calls
me only if he needs my help

1759
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,240
Sir, please tell me

1760
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:06,520
Sekar, a boy called me
from Chinna's number

1761
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,120
Trace that call

1762
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,160
Sure Sir

1763
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,600
Don't delegate this
job to anyone else

1764
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:12,640
Do it yourself

1765
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,960
You bet! I will do it myself

1766
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:21,600
Sir

1767
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,160
I traced that number

1768
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,040
It was made from
Dhandapani's area

1769
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,560
I thought so. Lets go see him

1770
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:28,440
Sir! Sir! Just a minute

1771
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,160
- There is a  limit
- Sir! Sir! Just a minute

1772
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,080
He demanded 20 million!

1773
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,280
Just hear me out

1774
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,720
Let's pay up and get the bottle now

1775
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,520
We'll deal Dhandapani later

1776
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,520
Dhandapani is not important

1777
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,480
It's the bottle that
matters right now

1778
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,120
Get the money

1779
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,560
Let's go get the bottle, first

1780
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,480
Come on, guys

1781
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,840
Here, answer it

1782
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,200
Hello, call him and
ask him to come alone

1783
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:10,760
Hello

1784
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,800
You must come alone

1785
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,200
Do not bring police
or any crappy guards

1786
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:14,800
Got it?

1787
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,800
If you don't obey my words...

1788
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,640
bottle will burst into pieces

1789
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,080
Here, take the bottle

1790
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,080
Take these guys to that room.
You come with me

1791
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,360
I'll keep instructing over the call
and you better follow it or else...

1792
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,240
Move!

1793
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,560
Kumar, be ready

1794
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:50,840
Ok, chief

1795
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:52,760
Minister has arrived

1796
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:53,640
Kumar, send him

1797
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:54,280
Now, go!

1798
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,520
Ask him to open the bag and show

1799
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:08,760
Tell him to open the bag and show

1800
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,920
Open the bag and show

1801
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:16,840
Take a good look

1802
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,320
It is not fake currencies

1803
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,760
All are original currencies

1804
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,720
Fine. Now, where is the bottle?

1805
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,480
Hand it over

1806
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,360
Ask him to throw the bag

1807
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,440
Ask him to throw the bag

1808
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,800
Throw the bag to me

1809
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,800
Give me the bottle

1810
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,840
First, throw the bag

1811
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,280
Now, give me the bottle

1812
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,320
Do not throw it

1813
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:39,920
Hand it over

1814
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,640
Hand it over, dear

1815
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,200
Come on. I said, give it!

1816
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,720
Chief, he got hold of that boy!

1817
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:45,960
You! Go!

1818
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,280
Do as I ordered

1819
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,640
Kumar, I knew the minister
will act crazy like this

1820
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,800
Now, wait and watch

1821
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,280
Who sent you?

1822
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,240
Dhandapani, right?

1823
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,480
You better leave back in
the same way you came

1824
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,160
Let go of him

1825
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,400
Do anything crazy and...

1826
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,840
I will shoot you

1827
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,680
No! No! No!

1828
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,520
Cool! Cool! Cool!

1829
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,080
- Leave!
- Get rid of him, somehow!

1830
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,000
Only the money matters

1831
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:11,760
I shall leave

1832
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,680
Told you! He still uses a gun?

1833
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,600
Crazy! Run!

1834
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,640
You had gun, right?
You should have shot!

1835
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,840
That was a dummy gun!

1836
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,880
Tell me, sir

1837
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,080
Finish off Dhandapani right away

1838
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,520
- Else we will get caught
- Ok sir

1839
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,160
Stop! Stop Kaduhu

1840
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,080
Hey Kaduhu!
Kaaka!

1841
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:19,160
Get up, Kaduhu is
going commit suicide

1842
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,120
Quick! Get up!

1843
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,240
Kaaka, save him else he will die

1844
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,640
Hey Kaduhu

1845
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,000
Hey Kaduhu, stop!

1846
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,040
Stop!

1847
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,480
- Hey Kaduhu!
- Don't you also leave us

1848
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:41,680
Are you crazy?

1849
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,880
This is all because of me

1850
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,160
I am the reason behind all this

1851
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,960
I was hell bent on
going to Pondicherry

1852
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,160
He even fought with
Dub-sis for that

1853
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,840
I am the one who
stole that bottle

1854
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,960
Pandian got killed because of me

1855
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,640
I am to be blamed for all this!

1856
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,720
- Damn you!
- No!

1857
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,440
So, you also decided
to leave us alone?

1858
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,720
Opposition Leader Dhandapani
died in a car accident

1859
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,440
His driver is also died in the accident

1860
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,600
This accident took place at
East Coast Road near Koovathur

1861
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:38,800
The police department says that they
are inquiring the workers of there

1862
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,120
Superb! Superb! Superb!

1863
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,760
Now, we are going to
mint money from Minister

1864
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,200
Confused?

1865
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:07,560
Enough of escaping

1866
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,080
Let's not let them escape anymore

1867
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:11,920
What is so important
about this bottle?

1868
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,680
Minister is ready to
throw millions for it

1869
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,160
Why should we bother about that?

1870
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:18,360
What matters is how much will
minister pay for this bottle?

1871
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,120
They took away our peace

1872
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,520
We must snatch it back

1873
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,840
What if those boys expose
us to the minister?

1874
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,520
We must get them
before that happens

1875
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,800
What can we do?

1876
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,280
We must not give
up until we win!

1877
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,760
I'm sure there is way

1878
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,560
Minister should not
get hold of the boys

1879
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,160
You! What you are doing?

1880
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,960
Sir, we thought Dhandapani
was behind everything

1881
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,880
But Dhandapani is dead now

1882
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:44,480
Then who must be having the bottle?

1883
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:58,120
By midnight 8th November 2016

1884
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:08,560
Current Five Hundred and One
Thousand Rupee currency notes...

1885
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,480
won't be legal and are
invalid hereafter

1886
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,320
Let's not spare anyone of them!

1887
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,240
" Two currencies are
no more valid now"

1888
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,760
" Queues in the ATMs
are raising eyebrows"

1889
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,360
" All dressed up but now a beggar"

1890
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,000
" Now the rich and poor are
one flock, flying together"

1891
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:34,440
"There is nothing now
in everyone's purse"

1892
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,040
" For some it's even worse"

1893
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,440
" Those who piled up all that money..."

1894
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,920
" it's all gone now, honey!"

1895
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,400
" No cash!"

1896
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,600
" Time to swipe and pay"

1897
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,480
" No cash!"

1898
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,160
" Time to celebrate simply"

1899
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,920
" No cash! No cash! No cash!"

1900
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,880
" Time to learn the old ways"

1901
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,800
" No cash! No cash! No!
No! Cash! Cash!"

1902
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,040
" Time to close our eyes
and enjoy this phase"

1903
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:03,600
Can nothing be done
without that chip?

1904
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,240
Without it we'll have to
break open the locker

1905
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,400
But it will be considered as theft

1906
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,080
We must nab the boys and
minister must believe me

1907
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,920
Also must find out the worth of that bottle

1908
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:15,400
" Life is like the fake currency"

1909
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,760
" Breaking news now
has shocking tendency"

1910
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,320
" Money saved with great
efforts is of no use now"

1911
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:23,080
" Money snatched by the
frauds are now white somehow"

1912
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,680
" Well, we played our
parts as the citizen"

1913
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,920
" Like blinds we trusted them"

1914
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,320
" Young and the old
standing in the same queue"

1915
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,080
" We though that's the end cue"

1916
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,760
" Enter the new tax rule!"

1917
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,080
" No cash!"

1918
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:38,920
The money we got is now ivalid

1919
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,560
But why?

1920
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,000
Seems like they are putting
an end to black money!

1921
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,400
Can't they trace the balck money
alone and put an end to it

1922
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:49,920
" Time to learn the old ways"

1923
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,680
" No cash! No cash! No!
No! Cash! Cash!"

1924
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,560
" Time to close our eyes
and enjoy this phase"

1925
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,720
" Money is blood for
the downtrodden"

1926
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,720
" It's honest earning
bearing all the burden"

1927
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,440
Not one or two! It's
worth 20 billon!

1928
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,680
Guess they already knew
about demonetization

1929
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:11,320
That is why he is planning
something to save his 20 billion!

1930
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,320
Tomorrow morning 6 'O clock...

1931
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,680
Cash will be dispersed from
here to its all the branches

1932
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,320
Before it reaches the destination,
our operation must be done

1933
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,240
This is your best chance

1934
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,760
If you miss this opportunity...

1935
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,920
it is impossible to
exchange this 20 billion

1936
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,080
"Cash...cash...cash"

1937
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:28,600
" No cash!"

1938
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,320
" Time to swipe and pay"

1939
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,760
" No cash!"

1940
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,680
" Time to celebrate simply"

1941
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:39,120
Inform me as soon as
you get that bottle

1942
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,400
I'll come with the plan

1943
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,240
They are planning something big.
Wonder what it is!

1944
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,160
If we expose this bottle matter...

1945
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,200
Minister will get caught

1946
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,200
" Demonetization!"

1947
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,880
" What will happen to our nation?"

1948
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,160
" Question like this and you'll
end up in police station!"

1949
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,640
"This is fake globalisation"

1950
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,200
"This is fake globalisation"

1951
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,000
"This is fake globalisation"

1952
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:05,600
We shall go tell that honest
police, whom Sekar hides from

1953
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,320
Will they believe us?

1954
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,360
Let's just knock it and rock!

1955
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,520
We planned this operation
on 1st November

1956
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:25,720
Not 20 but I would have
even paid up 200 million!

1957
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,240
Sir..

1958
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:43,800
Oh! Looks like the police
department took you back?

1959
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:47,760
Can't nab three little boys
and you call yourself a...

1960
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:48,480
Hey!

1961
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,440
Move! Get inside!

1962
01:36:59,160 --> 01:36:59,960
Good! Good!

1963
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:10,320
We only have six hours

1964
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,120
I don't care what you
do or how you do it!

1965
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:18,080
Within six hours, we must turn
our old currencies into new

1966
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:22,440
Or else we will also become
invalid like old currencies

1967
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,280
This is very important announcement.
Very confidential too

1968
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,480
Demonetization news that was
announced day before yesterday...

1969
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,720
was shocking news to only us

1970
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:38,800
For some it is a
one month old news

1971
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,480
So they must have converted their
black money into gold and diamonds

1972
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,600
But how much can they convert?

1973
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,840
People here have thousands
of million black money

1974
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,960
They wouldn't have
converted all of it

1975
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,640
RBI would have deposited the new currencies
in the lockers of all their head quarters

1976
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,800
In exactly six hours...

1977
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:59,680
they'll divide those currencies
and send it to their branches

1978
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:03,960
There are seven secret
lockers in our city

1979
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,840
It opens only with two keys

1980
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:08,560
One key is in the possession of
the branch head quarter's GM

1981
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,240
Other one with the RBI

1982
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,720
Also automatic CCTV
cameras are installed

1983
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,840
But the point is...

1984
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:21,160
It will be easy for people to shift
their black money at this hour

1985
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,720
So in every major points...

1986
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,440
...like check posts,
toll plaza, airport...

1987
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:29,400
especially thoroughly check all
the vehicles in major highways

1988
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,760
Provide high security vigilance

1989
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:34,840
Hello

1990
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,920
If you want the bottle, then
the pay up 200 million!

1991
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:38,960
Same place

1992
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:45,160
Your girl friend, Anjana
is now in my custody

1993
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,520
Get up!

1994
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,160
Marry her or make her your mistress

1995
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:49,840
Do as you wish

1996
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,880
All I need is 200 million

1997
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,440
Play fair this time and
I'll also play fair

1998
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:57,200
Hello? Hello!

1999
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,120
First, let's pay them
and get the bottle

2000
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,200
Later we'll deal those boys

2001
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:11,480
Hello

2002
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:15,400
Forgot to mention. Don't pay us
using the invalid currencies!

2003
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,480
Give the payment
in Gold biscuits. Got it?

2004
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:18,760
I'll hang up now

2005
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:39,520
Call up the bank GM and
ask him to come at once

2006
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,760
Sir, these boys came to meet Rajaram

2007
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,680
I tricked them and got them here. See you

2008
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,640
Got them!

2009
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:57,680
Welcome boys...

2010
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,480
Kaaka!

2011
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,480
No one must interfere

2012
01:40:05,481 --> 01:40:06,575
<b>www.1TamilMV.live</b><br/>

2013
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,000
I'll handle these boys!

2014
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:08,920
You!

2015
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:10,680
Move!

2016
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,200
Listen...

2017
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:15,920
if you try to expose me...

2018
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,320
Sir, he is the one behind....

2019
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,960
Don't stop them. Let's
wait and watch them

2020
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,400
He's the one behind all of this

2021
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,480
No! Sekar! Don't!

2022
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,560
Cool! Cool!

2023
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:38,560
I will encounter him

2024
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,360
Give it to me

2025
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,160
- Go
- Come on, guys

2026
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:54,400
Hey!

2027
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,720
- Where is the bottle?
- Open the car!

2028
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,240
You heard me! Open it!

2029
01:40:58,880 --> 01:40:59,960
Relax!

2030
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:09,640
Why are you so hot
headed, Sekar?

2031
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:14,720
It's better to be brainy
than being hot headed

2032
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,800
Bottle is our priority right now

2033
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,680
Sir, we must not
let them so easy

2034
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,600
Come on. Drink

2035
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:28,800
Sekar, how would you feel
if you drink was poisoned?

2036
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,040
I felt the exact same way

2037
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:35,680
When all savings became invalid

2038
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:37,600
The whole nation
when topsy turvy

2039
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,560
There was no difference between
the poor and the rich!

2040
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,240
When everyone is worried about
converting their old currencies to new...

2041
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,560
we alone are concerned about the bottle

2042
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,800
Look for it! Search properly

2043
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:48,520
Check below

2044
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,920
The pain endured while
missing an object...

2045
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:56,360
is nothing compared to the pain
endured when someone betrays us

2046
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,120
Got it.
Here

2047
01:42:00,215 --> 01:42:03,135
You said, we got the girl
and the boys will show up

2048
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,912
Then you said if the boys show
up, we'll get the bottle

2049
01:42:05,937 --> 01:42:08,440
The boys are here but
where is the bottle?

2050
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,440
So, where is that bottle?

2051
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,160
Why did you break it?

2052
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,560
What will you do for more booze?

2053
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,120
Answer me!

2054
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,960
This is our bank's head quarters

2055
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,360
All the cash from reserve
bank will arrive here

2056
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,200
The cash will be dispersed to all
branched in ATM security vehicles

2057
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,600
The security will tight
on the front end

2058
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:53,040
But there'll be only two people on
the back side and that too our men

2059
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:57,120
The chip you have will be
activated using a laptop...

2060
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:59,360
and using the coded generated
in it, we'll open the locker

2061
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:03,080
This code is valid only for ten minutes.
We must activate it before that

2062
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,160
The chip you possess, the chip
I possess and that code...

2063
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,120
The locker can be
opened with these three

2064
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:13,280
The only problem here is the
CCTV in the locker area

2065
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,440
If we try to turn it off or remove
it, the police will be alarmed

2066
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:21,640
But I can get it switched off for 30
minutes in the name of maintenance

2067
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:27,120
By then your men must replace the new 2000
currency wads with old 500 currency wads

2068
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:32,120
Sir, I'll mark an entry saying those old
currencies were collected from the public

2069
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:33,520
You won't face any issue

2070
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:36,520
You wait outside and I'll
get your money out safely

2071
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,200
Sekar! What are you doing?

2072
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,640
You better give me that
bag with golden biscuits!

2073
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,000
Give me the bag and
I'll be on my way

2074
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,880
- Listen to me
- I'll slit his throat!

2075
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:47,480
Shut up!

2076
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:48,480
Give me the bag!

2077
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,800
You're repeatedly
doing mistakes!

2078
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:50,960
It's ok! Just give me the bag!

2079
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,120
Sekar!

2080
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,880
Don't provoke me or
you'll face my wrath!

2081
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,520
- Let him go!
- The bag!

2082
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,320
Or I'll slit his throat!

2083
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,480
Listen to me, Sekar. Don't harm him.
Let go of him

2084
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,040
I don't mind dying but you
shouldn't get that money!

2085
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:03,560
You!

2086
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:19,120
Lock that girl and those
boys in the container!

2087
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,960
Guess, stealing is the
only way to get this done

2088
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,840
The boys will steal. They
don't have any option

2089
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,320
Do one thing, you
wear Sekar's uniform

2090
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,440
Pack up his corpse and bring along

2091
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:32,960
Once we're done, we'll burn
it along with old notes

2092
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,600
Call up the bank's
assistant manager

2093
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,720
Tell him we'll be entering
from the back gate

2094
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,520
Ask them to do the necessary arrangements

2095
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,520
Stop it!

2096
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,720
A person's throat was slit
and one was shot down!

2097
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,600
Don't you feel like crying out of fear?

2098
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,720
I've cried so much during childhood
that tears have dried up

2099
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,040
There is no tears left to shed

2100
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,040
Aren't you scared at all?

2101
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,480
Scared?

2102
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:06,720
They chased us down and shot us

2103
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,520
We witnessed things no
one should ever witness

2104
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,000
Bomb blasts all around

2105
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:20,040
When you guys were living a happy
life, we were running for our lives

2106
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:25,480
Everyone here went to school,
jobs, temple and to the movies...

2107
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:26,200
But us?

2108
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,000
We died each and everyday

2109
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,680
I lost all the fear back then itself

2110
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,160
Kaaka, don't get emotional

2111
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:49,440
No matter what happens,
we must expose them!

2112
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:50,640
Get ready to bear a lot of pain!

2113
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,080
Let's not give up until
they are exposed

2114
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,560
Can we do it?

2115
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,400
We can do it!

2116
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,320
Hope is what keeps us going!

2117
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,960
Hope is what drives
many lives even today!

2118
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,520
What is he saying?

2119
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,520
He has passed an
electronic chip to Chinna

2120
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:10,920
There must be some plan behind it.
Hence, Chinna got it

2121
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:15,560
An electric chip company in
Germany handed it over to him

2122
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,240
But no one knows why and
for what they gave it

2123
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,840
When did he come to India?

2124
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,680
Exactly on Nov 1st

2125
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:25,400
He met Chinna on the same night

2126
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,200
Demonetization was
announced recently

2127
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:31,840
But for some it is a one month old news

2128
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,240
There are seven secret
lockers in our city

2129
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,160
It opens only with two keys

2130
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,840
One key is in the possession of
the branch head quarter's GM

2131
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,720
Other one with the RBI

2132
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,200
I knew it!

2133
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,160
Find out where is Mr. Rajamanickam

2134
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,160
Without his knowledge

2135
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,280
We don't have any evidence

2136
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:55,160
Find his location and call me at once

2137
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,120
Everything's ready?

2138
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,200
Everything is ready

2139
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,520
The container containing the
old currencies are here

2140
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,240
Manager said he was on
his way to meet you

2141
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,560
He did come to meet me

2142
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:14,400
He won't show up anymore

2143
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,560
Sir? Sir?

2144
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,080
Switch off the CCTVs
on the outside

2145
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,440
- The minister is here
- Ok sir

2146
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,120
- Move!
- Keep moving!

2147
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:43,280
- Hope you've the other chip
- Yes, I do

2148
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:47,200
Take the boys in and
sweep of all the money!

2149
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:47,840
Ok sir

2150
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:49,200
Where is he?
Come here!

2151
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:54,360
If you mess up anything
after going inside...

2152
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,280
I'll finish her off

2153
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:57,760
Don't harm her

2154
01:47:58,840 --> 01:47:59,680
Just let her go

2155
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,720
Can I be able watch
what's happening inside?

2156
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:02,600
You can watch it in the laptop

2157
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,160
- Move!
- Get going!

2158
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,880
- Go!
- Get started!

2159
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,320
I hope you brought the other chip

2160
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:19,800
Remember, only the CCTV
outside are switched off

2161
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,640
Disturb any of the CCTV inside
and the police will be alarmed

2162
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:26,040
So, be careful. I'll be waiting
outside with the security

2163
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:26,840
Ok. You! Get in

2164
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:36,840
Go

2165
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,760
Insert the card in it

2166
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,760
Now, open it

2167
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,200
Get that trolly

2168
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:24,400
Make it fast

2169
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,040
They are stealing this because Rs.
500 is invalid

2170
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,680
What if this becomes invalid?

2171
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:50,320
Just shut up!

2172
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,960
Did we have all the money?

2173
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:18,720
Yes, sir. Got it

2174
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,080
Tie up these boys

2175
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:24,080
- Come on! Come here!
- Stand properly!

2176
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:34,120
Sir, they say there is some
kind of chip in this currency

2177
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,760
Fool! Nothing like that

2178
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,720
Set them ablaze along
with the old currencies

2179
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,320
Make the call!

2180
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:13,520
Hold him!

2181
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:19,440
Kaaka!

2182
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:23,280
Kaduhu!

2183
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:24,360
Come on!

2184
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,920
Go for it! Do it!

2185
01:52:56,920 --> 01:53:01,680
In the pursuit of new 2000 currencies,
Industrial minister R. Rajamanickam...

2186
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:03,960
was caught red handed by the police

2187
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,720
At a time where these new currencies will
be made available in banks from tomorrow...

2188
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,680
this incident has raised eyebrows

2189
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:13,680
More on this from our
reporter on spot, Mr. Prakash

2190
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,520
So, boys?

2191
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:17,720
Knowingly or by luck, you ended
up doing something really good

2192
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,920
Nothing wrong with the
idea of making money

2193
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,600
What matters is how you do it

2194
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:25,720
Or else you'll find
yourselves in such mess

2195
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,560
Sir, I need a help

2196
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:31,520
I asked around. Can you help me
to get change for 500 rupees?

2197
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,080
It is invalid hereafter

2198
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:36,200
The bank printed these notes. How
can they refuse to accept it?

2199
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:39,240
It's the government's order to not
to raise any question for fifty days

2200
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,200
Why fifty days, sir?

2201
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,920
What did I just say? No questions!

2202
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,960
" No cash!"

2203
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,240
" Time to swipe and pay"

2204
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,120
" No cash!"

2205
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,800
" Time to celebrate simply"

2206
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,520
" No cash! No cash! No cash!"

2207
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,480
" Time to learn the old ways"

2208
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,480
" No cash! No cash! No!
No! Cash! Cash!"

2209
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,680
" Time to close our eyes
and enjoy this phase"

2210
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:26,520
" Demonetization!"

2211
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,080
" What will happen to our nation?"

2212
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:31,440
" Question like this and you'll
end up in police station!"

2213
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,880
" Demonetization!"

2214
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,480
" What will happen to our nation?"

2215
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,880
" Question like this and you'll
end up in police station!"

2216
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,880
"This is fake globalisation"

2217
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,600
"This is fake globalisation"

2218
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:55,120
"This is fake globalisation"

2219
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,680
Fully confusion

2220
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,120
What a life?!
