Ripped by gdhaliwal23

2
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,375
So you are finally here.

3
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,916
Boss, stop loitering around
and get some work done as well.

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,875
Be in Manner. I am your boss.

5
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,458
All three vehicles
will reach there by three.

6
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,500
Don't forget to call them
and take the payment.

7
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,250
The fifth vehicle will be there by five.

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,958
Be careful.

9
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,958
Give me the keys!

10
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,833
What? Where are you going now?

11
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:26,791
-Give me the keys now!
-Here.

12
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,125
Come on already!

13
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,708
Hello, sweetheart!

14
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,125
You won't stop this, will you?

15
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,458
You and your cheesy flirting.

16
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,750
You call my love cheesy flirting?
This is so wrong.

17
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,666
-You will never get a heart attack.
-Why?

18
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,708
People with hearts made of stone
can never get heart attacks.

19
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,375
<i>Stop your nonsense.</i>

20
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,708
You know that a good pasting always helps
to get rid of roadside Romeos.

21
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,500
Oh no. Now you are scaring me.

22
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,375
<i>But I won't feel bad.</i>

23
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,500
Because every beauty has the right
to show some attitude.

24
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:27,833
My mother used to say this.

25
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,166
I think you have never dealt with lawyers.

26
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,500
-I think I will have to tell you.
-Then tell me.

27
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:36,958
I am not running away.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,083
I want you to fight my case
and I'd invest my life in it.

29
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,375
<i>Get this straight...</i>

30
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,083
Never call me up again.

31
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,833
Miss Lali,
I'd like to take you out for dinner.

32
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,375
You can bring your brother along.

33
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,541
Okay?

34
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,208
You can enjoy dinner while I enjoy
getting beaten up by your brother.

35
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,166
I have never met anyone so shameless.

36
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,208
I won't go for any dinner.

37
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,291
Miss Lali, I am going to India tomorrow.

38
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,458
Please, have a candlelight dinner
with me before I leave. Please?

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,375
I told you, I am not interested.
It's final.

40
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,958
Really? Then there you go.

41
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,250
<i>All the formulas to keep romance alive</i>
<i>in married life are great.</i>

42
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,083
<i>Well, most of them don't work,</i>
<i>that's another issue.</i>

43
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,333
They value work
but they don't value people.

44
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,125
What happened?

45
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,125
Angry is more valuable or pounds?

46
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,250
You know,

47
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,000
when I hung up on you, I realized

48
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,500
that I don't need to waste
a few hundred pounds on food.

49
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,583
Only fortunate ones
get food cooked by their spouse.

50
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,625
Harry!

51
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,458
No saliva!

52
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,916
Only fortunate ones get saliva
from their spouse. Come on.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,875
-Really?
-You don't believe me?

54
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,541
Here, hold my bag.
He has a way with words.

55
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:07,458
Unlock the door.

56
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,541
What's for dinner?

57
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,166
Yogurt, kidney beans...

58
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,708
And I will be cooking rice.

59
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,250
You will eat and go to bed.

60
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,458
Lali!

61
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,375
Today, I will do the dishes.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,250
<i>That's me. Fateh.</i>

63
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,125
<i>I am sneaking in like a thief</i>
<i>instead of showing up like a hero.</i>

64
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,625
<i>Not by choice, but out of fear</i>

65
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,708
<i>of my brother Harry and sister-in-law.</i>

66
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,000
-Let me go, bro.
-Keep it down. You'll get us into trouble.

67
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,000
Please let me go. Listen to me.

68
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,708
Where are you coming from
so late in the night?

69
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,708
It's not that late. It's just ten o'clock.

70
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,916
I don't know why you can go to bed
so early like scared goats.

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,500
What will I tell the lioness sleeping
inside? Where have you been?

72
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:21,708
Bro, hockey...

73
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,041
I had gone to watch a hockey match.

74
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,000
Harry!

75
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,791
Yes?

76
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,458
I came to pee.

77
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,416
I thought you were talking to someone.
Who is in there with you?

78
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:37,541
Sister-in-law...

79
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,708
I just got a little emotional.

80
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,500
You work so hard.

81
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,916
-You do so much for us.
-Liar.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,250
I don't know whether
I am doing enough for you or not.

83
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,958
Harry...
You don't have to be so emotional.

84
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,750
-Come to bed.
-Okay, love. Go, I am coming.

85
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,416
Come already!

86
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,666
But you just hit me.

87
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:04,791
Really?

88
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,125
I forgot.

89
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,875
Listen up!
Don't you dare mention this game again.

90
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,583
-Why do you...
-Do you see this?

91
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,708
So... You are late again?

92
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,541
Lali, I...

93
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,833
I am not talking to you.

94
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,875
-No, I...
-What? I what?

95
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,291
He sent me out.

96
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,625
For what work
did he send you out at midnight?

97
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,500
What secret mission was it that later
you two were whispering in the washroom?

98
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,958
Yes? I am talking to you, Fateh.

99
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,458
How many times have I told you...
both of you...

100
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,333
That I get very angry
if you lie or hide anything...

101
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,750
from me.

102
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,583
-Well...
-What?

103
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,208
Go. You have to go to college tomorrow.

104
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,041
-Don't forget this.
-Okay.

105
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,583
No lying or hiding
anything in this family.

106
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,041
Okay.

107
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,125
Let's go. We have to go to work tomorrow.

108
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,375
Go.

109
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,791
-Give me the bag, bro.
-Why, take it yourself.

110
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,458
Sometimes I feel like I am in a prison.

111
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,125
I cannot meet girls. I cannot play hockey.

112
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,666
I have to carry my own bag.
I have to wash my own clothes.

113
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,125
You should let me do
as I please sometimes.

114
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,125
Aren't you getting late?

115
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,416
Okay, come on, boys. Focus, yeah?

116
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,625
-Come on, boys.
-Yes.

117
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,541
Go boys! Yes! Nice one! Nice one!

118
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,958
<i>I always enter the university like a hero.</i>

119
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,541
<i>Whether or not anyone notices me,</i>
<i>I don't care.</i>

120
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,250
So Harry, how many goals did you score?

121
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,291
We are leading by 2-1.

122
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,541
It will end as 7-2.

123
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,208
You guys will only be able to score two.

124
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,958
They will be scoring seven.

125
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,250
Go away, man. You're not playing anyways.

126
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,500
Don't sit outside the field
and keep making predictions.

127
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,125
Naaz! Hurry up! He is here.

128
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,416
Come on, hurry up! He is almost here.

129
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,541
Naaz! He is here.

130
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,125
Hurry up.

131
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,291
-No...
-Fateh!

132
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,708
<i>This Indian chick who is even more</i>
<i>beautiful than Englishwomen...</i>

133
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,666
<i>She is crazy about me.</i>

134
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,208
<i>But I have to stay away from her as well.</i>

135
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,583
Fateh... Let me express
my feelings to you today.

136
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,458
You should keep your feelings
in your heart.

137
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,625
You are under the oath of KFC's old man.

138
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,416
I am already in a lot of trouble.

139
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,333
I won't be able to give you my heart.

140
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,083
Goodbye.

141
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,166
-Goodbye.
-So...

142
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,208
Goodbye.

143
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,083
So?

144
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:33,791
What?

145
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,458
7-2.

146
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,375
Now do you believe me?

147
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,250
-What is this?
-You tell me.

148
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,041
That's the goal post.

149
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,583
That's the goalkeeper.

150
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,125
-And this...
-And...

151
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,500
you will say that
those two cans are defense?

152
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,916
Wonderful.

153
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,250
If only you had used your brains
on the field as well

154
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,708
then it would've been 2-1.

155
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:02,875
Forget it.

156
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,250
Here, the deep sweeper passes the ball

157
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,083
to the right defender.

158
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,416
Right defender passes the ball

159
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,375
to right midfielder.

160
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,375
Right midfielder will pass the ball
to right attacker.

161
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,500
The defense of right wing is stronger
so it will be difficult to score there.

162
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,166
Hence, the ball passes.

163
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,041
Middle midfielder to the left attacker.

164
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,583
Close the left defender,

165
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,291
body dribble.

166
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,916
And score a goal
from the right side of the goalie.

167
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,125
Come on, man.
This is not how hockey is played.

168
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,416
The goalkeeper
will throw your ball across.

169
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,416
The ball isn't being passed
so scoring a goal is impossible.

170
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,875
How is it impossible?
I just showed it to you.

171
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,333
-Forget it.
-You don't play hockey on a table.

172
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,125
You play it on the ground.

173
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,208
These glasses won't hold you back.

174
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,125
You can score as many goals as you want.

175
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,791
What do you want?

176
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,083
When the time comes, I shall
score a goal on the ground as well.

177
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,708
Trials for the university club
will be taking place.

178
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,625
I'll see what you can do there.

179
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,416
Look, I've already told you that the
situation in my house is quite tense.

180
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,166
My sister-in-law has asked me
to stay away from girls from England.

181
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,833
And my brother has asked me
not to stay away from hockey.

182
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,041
Excuses. You can make as many as you want.

183
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:17,791
Fine.

184
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,833
I am getting late for my class.

185
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,791
Naaz, why were you so rude to him?

186
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't know what happens to me
in front of him.

187
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,166
I don't understand that either.

188
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,500
Do you like him or hate him?

189
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,416
<i>Like every year,</i>

190
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:05,000
<i>white coach Clayton</i>
<i>and Punjabi coach Grewal...</i>

191
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,000
<i>are arguing over the same thing.</i>

192
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,083
<i>This time as well</i>

193
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,291
<i>Clayton had kept only white players</i>
<i>in the university's team.</i>

194
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:16,291
<i>White skin, cat eyes and a black heart.</i>
<i>That's Clayton.</i>

195
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
<i>A creature of habit.</i>

196
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,958
<i>According to him, no one can play hockey</i>
<i>better than Englishmen.</i>

197
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,666
<i>And he has sworn</i>

198
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:29,375
<i>not to lose a single opportunity</i>
<i>to make fun of Punjabis and Indians.</i>

199
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,500
Yes, dear?

200
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,208
Okay, dear.

201
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,041
Clayton is right.

202
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,750
Most Indians here are into manual labor.

203
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,291
How will they play hockey?

204
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,916
There has to be someone...

205
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,750
who can shut them up.

206
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,791
There's a boy in my class.

207
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,208
He's a very good player.

208
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,208
He can beat all Britishers.

209
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,666
Who? Send him to me.

210
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,208
He isn't allowed to play hockey.

211
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,250
So much anger?

212
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,000
We want to win the world...

213
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,583
But our own don't let us play.

214
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:50,375
Unfulfilled dreams hurt the most.

215
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,500
You have one last chance
to fulfill your dream.

216
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,250
Give it here.

217
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,333
Your bag's quite heavy today.

218
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,458
Is it heavy? I don't have bricks in it.

219
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,750
If only you ever went
to university would you know

220
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,958
how burdensome education can be.

221
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,708
We have to work hard, bro.

222
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,583
This isn't a gearless taxi
that anybody can drive.

223
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,166
It is loaded with books. Bye.

224
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,791
See you in the evening.

225
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,375
Okay.

226
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,708
<i>Double damn.</i>

227
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,375
<i>I gathered all the courage I could</i>
<i>and came here for trials.</i>

228
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,416
<i>And here they are</i>
<i>arguing over the same old thing.</i>

229
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:27,916
<i>Grewal insists that our boys have</i>
<i>a better technique than the white players.</i>

230
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,291
<i>But most players voted</i>
<i>for the white players.</i>

231
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,000
<i>And as usual,</i>
<i>Mr. Grewal couldn't do anything.</i>

232
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,625
-Hello, Fateh.
-Hello...

233
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,250
Remain seated, son.

234
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,291
My daughter Naaz told me about you.

235
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,583
She says you are very good hockey player.

236
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,583
Well, sir, I sometimes...

237
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,208
Coach has got another one of his losers.

238
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,083
<i>There you go. They called me a loser.</i>

239
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,333
Let's go then.

240
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,500
Sir, I am not in the mood for it.

241
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,875
Okay, then sit and watch the game.

242
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,791
We'll talk about this later. Okay?

243
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,208
-Yeah.
-Damn...

244
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,083
Son, you alright?

245
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,458
Coach!

246
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,083
I am in the mood for it now.

247
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,791
<i>I too know that.</i>
<i>I was just having a little fun.</i>

248
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,083
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>now I'll give you taste of my hockey.</i>

249
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,791
Fateh!

250
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,375
Hey, come on!

251
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,750
Come on, focus, boys.

252
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,541
Good. Bill...

253
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,875
Yeah!

254
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:11,791
<i>I knew my heart was no longer mine</i>

255
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,875
<i>From the time</i>

256
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,500
<i>I looked into her blue eyes</i>

257
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,208
<i>I knew my heart</i>

258
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,500
<i>Was no longer mine</i>

259
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:30,041
<i>From the time I looked into her blue eyes</i>

260
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,208
<i>My restless eyes</i>

261
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,625
<i>Seek her sight</i>

262
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,041
<i>I eagerly wait for her</i>

263
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,125
<i>This is how bad is my plight</i>

264
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,375
<i>I knew my heart</i>

265
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,833
<i>Was no longer mine</i>

266
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:54,166
<i>From the time I looked into her blue eyes</i>

267
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,125
<i>I knew my heart was no longer mine</i>

268
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:09,125
<i>From the time</i>

269
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:11,916
<i>She has entered my life</i>

270
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,875
<i>My dreams</i>

271
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,583
<i>Have become fragrant and bright</i>

272
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,708
<i>My dreams</i>

273
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,666
<i>When I try to touch her</i>

274
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,666
<i>She disappears</i>

275
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,416
<i>In my dreams</i>

276
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,666
<i>Then I search for her in despair</i>

277
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,125
<i>I knew my heart</i>

278
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,083
<i>Was no longer mine</i>

279
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,208
<i>From the time</i>

280
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:44,041
<i>I looked into her blue eyes</i>

281
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:48,541
<i>I knew my heart</i>

282
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,166
What are you hiding?

283
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,583
Nothing...

284
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,875
Nothing. Don't hit me.

285
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,625
What are you hiding?

286
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,291
No, it hurts!

287
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,708
Nothing.

288
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,458
-Liar! What are you hiding?
-Please...

289
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:46,916
It's nothing.

290
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,166
-What?
-Stop it, man.

291
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,208
Wait.

292
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,833
This.

293
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,083
When did we come here?

294
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,666
When I was this small.

295
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,291
I wasn't this small.
I was quite big when I came here.

296
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:08,083
I have a lot of responsibilities on me.

297
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,208
Do you think I am your enemy?

298
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:15,625
I don't steal anything from anyone.

299
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,125
I don't do drugs.

300
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,250
You are always hitting me.

301
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,166
People get milk and cream while growing up
and all I got were whacks from you.

302
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,291
Where were you born?

303
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,333
No, Punjab!

304
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,416
-Tell.
-Sansarpur, Jalandhar district, Punjab.

305
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,875
Sansarpur.

306
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:36,791
Sansarpur.

307
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,166
Sansarpur.

308
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,041
Do you know anything about Sansarpur?

309
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,000
This game that you play...

310
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:48,791
It was born there.

311
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:52,916
Sit.

312
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,875
I have heard my elders saying that...

313
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,041
A mother was preparing a meal...

314
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,333
What's wrong, son?
Why are you shaking your legs?

315
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,875
You shouldn't do that.

316
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,333
-I want to play.
-You want to play?

317
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:33,000
He wants to play. Wait. Wait here,
I'll be right back. Wait here.

318
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,625
She gathered a few rags
and tied them together.

319
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,458
<i>She made a ball out of it.</i>

320
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,333
Here you go.

321
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:47,291
Look at this.

322
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,500
What is this?

323
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,583
They had a berry tree in their house.

324
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,416
She broke a branch from it,

325
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,125
<i>cleaned it and give it to her son.</i>

326
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:04,000
This is a ball and this is a stick.

327
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,291
Look at this...

328
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,875
Go, go, go... Go and get it.

329
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,000
It kept the child occupied.

330
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,750
And the mother got back to her work.

331
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,416
Every child in the village
started playing with it.

332
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,541
Get your sticks.

333
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:20,208
-Coming.
-Hurry up.

334
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,500
They used to push the ball around
with their sticks.

335
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,791
Wait.

336
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,416
Play with my ball.

337
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,375
Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give it to me.

338
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,750
<i>This addiction of the children</i>

339
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,458
<i>soon became the favorite game</i>
<i>for all the villagers.</i>

340
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,541
-It was called ball...
-...stick.

341
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:49,500
Back then, there used to be
a British camp close to Sansarpur.

342
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:50,541
An army camp.

343
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:51,916
That camp is still there.

344
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
It's now called Jalandhar Cantonment.

345
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,541
<i>Villagers from our village</i>
<i>used to go there to work.</i>

346
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,541
<i>They used to take their kids with them.</i>

347
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,708
<i>And kids used to play with the ball</i>
<i>and stick whenever they had free time.</i>

348
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,125
On the other side,
Englishmen used to play polo.

349
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:15,625
<i>Englishwomen stopped watching polo...</i>

350
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,666
and instead started watching
the kids play with the ball and sticks.

351
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,125
Ball and stick.

352
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,916
Ball and stick.

353
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,750
Ball and stick.

354
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:40,333
<i>Britishers being Britishers,</i>
<i>they wanted to know what it is.</i>

355
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,916
<i>So they tried to find out. As usual...</i>

356
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,958
<i>Then later named the game hockey.</i>

357
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,000
-Hey, what's that stick called?
-Khundi.

358
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:54,375
Sansarpur, a tiny tract on planet earth.

359
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,916
But a sport honed and played here...

360
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,416
got glorified in the world as hockey.

361
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,500
Sansarpur, Punjab, India.

362
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:14,000
These three names became renowned
in the world of sports.

363
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:21,000
1926: Australia and New Zealand.

364
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:23,000
1928: Europe.

365
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:27,791
1932: America, Holland,
Czechoslovakia, Japan and Germany.

366
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,583
Indian hockey created such a benchmark...

367
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,333
That no one has still been able
to match up to it.

368
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,625
From 1928 to 1960,

369
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,916
we had 30 international wins, Fateh.

370
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:42,583
From 1928 to 1960, 178 goals.

371
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,416
And how many goals against them?
Only seven.

372
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,666
The biggest win in the Olympics
was against America.

373
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,041
24-1. And why
did they get to score that one goal?

374
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,916
Because the goalie was standing behind
and giving an autograph.

375
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,541
The Indian hockey team is a team...

376
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:02,750
which has won gold five times in Olympics.

377
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,416
Our Sansarpur is a village

378
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,750
which has not given one, two, five or ten,

379
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:16,291
but fifteen Olympians to India.

380
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,375
1978 Olympics.

381
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,666
Nine people marching behind Indian flag.

382
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,000
Four people marching behind Kenya flag.

383
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,708
Two people behind Canada flag.

384
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:29,083
In one Olympic,
there were 15 people from the same village

385
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,958
in three teams of different countries.
Can you beat it?

386
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,125
Do you know anything about Sant Singh?

387
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,625
He was an Olympian?

388
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,125
He was our father.

389
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,375
-Go Shinde.
-Pass the ball.

390
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:12,958
-Go, go, pass it.
-Hurry up.

391
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,333
-Go for it!
-Goal!

392
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,333
Very good! Amazing! Wonderful!

393
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

394
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,000
Sant Singh, you are always so busy.

395
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,666
Can't you spare time to talk to us?

396
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,708
Brother Balbir, brother Pargat...

397
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:51,750
You have set examples
by winning Olympic medals.

398
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:57,041
And the boys
who want to follow your footsteps...

399
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,791
I just look after the grounds for them.

400
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:03,166
And what if we ask you for something?

401
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,208
Whatever you want, sir.
Tell me, what can I do for you?

402
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,875
Sant Singh...

403
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:11,750
Though there is a hockey player
in every household of this village...

404
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:16,291
We are here because
we know your son is very talented.

405
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,000
Your son plays a good game.

406
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,208
Okay.

407
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,041
We have come here so that we can take him
to play for the Indian hockey team.

408
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:27,750
Sant Singh,

409
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:31,041
your son can also score a goal
with a broken hockey stick.

410
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,791
If we train him in Patiala,
then in the future,

411
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:37,500
he might not just play nationally
but in the Olympics as well.

412
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,166
This can help our country
and this village once again

413
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,750
find its place back on hockey's map.

414
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,125
Brother Pargat,

415
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:48,625
thank you...

416
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,208
for thinking about my son.

417
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,833
But...

418
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,833
You know how bad
my financial situation is.

419
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,708
I will have to spend money
to send him to Patiala.

420
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,375
And I cannot afford that.

421
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,291
So,

422
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,250
if you can help me, then...

423
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,791
Sant Singh,

424
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,541
you know the condition
our association is in.

425
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,625
Even after three years of hard work,

426
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,583
we have managed to lay only half the turf.

427
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,000
I don't know what the truth is...

428
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,458
But we have got only this much money...

429
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,833
from the money that was allotted to us
by the government.

430
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,375
You should think it over.

431
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:29,166
We too will try our best.

432
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:30,750
Goodbye.

433
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32,750
Goodbye.

434
00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,416
Father?

435
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,708
You don't want me to play hockey anymore?

436
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,458
You have played enough hockey
in this village.

437
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,708
Now it's time
you venture out of this village.

438
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,000
You...

439
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,250
You take this with you.

440
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:22,875
A new hockey stick.

441
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,125
I got you admitted
into Patiala sports academy.

442
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,041
You should now practice very hard.

443
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,541
I don't think you will now have time
to hug anyone.

444
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,500
-You want to eat samosas?
-No.

445
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,791
Have some. How are you doing?

446
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,333
Look there, a new player.

447
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,500
A new player is better ignored.

448
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,916
Go, go, go.

449
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,000
Pass it to me.

450
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:19,458
Do it. Pass it to me.

451
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,375
Goal!

452
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,416
Very good.

453
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,291
-That's a nice goal.
-Very good.

454
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,750
-Hey!
-Captain is calling us.

455
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,541
-Let's go.
-Let's see what he has to say.

456
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:31,833
What will he say? We did good.

457
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,250
You are not bad.

458
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,833
-What do you say, boys?
-Yes, captain.

459
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,666
You should work hard.

460
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,375
Captain doesn't praise anyone
so easily, brother.

461
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,458
Only an expert knows
the true value of a gem.

462
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:45,333
-Let's go.
-We will see what happens.

463
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:48,250
Let's go. Let's go to the canteen.

464
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,875
You want one?

465
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,166
Don't.

466
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,583
I concentrate on practice
and not on the uniform.

467
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:49,708
I know.

468
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,625
I am doing well in my practice.

469
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,541
Coach too is pleased with me.

470
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:57,708
Captain is a little jealous.

471
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,583
But he still praises me.

472
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,708
I know.

473
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,625
They are coming to select players
for the national team tomorrow.

474
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,958
They all say that I will get selected.

475
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,625
I know that as well.

476
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,291
If I get selected in the national team,
then I will surely win a medal.

477
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,583
If I win a medal, will you marry me?

478
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:28,875
Hurry up, pass the ball.

479
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,000
Here, here, here...

480
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,750
-Pass the ball...
-Over here.

481
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,333
Goal!

482
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,666
Go for it!

483
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,500
Stop, stop, stop.

484
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,333
Come here, boy. Have some sweets.

485
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,458
Your life is made now.

486
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,541
We had great expectations from you, Harry.

487
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:29,000
-And this is how you repaid us.
-What do you mean, sir?

488
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:32,000
Don't act naive,
as if you don't know anything.

489
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,625
Sir, I don't understand
what you are talking about.

490
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,250
We aren't saying anything,
but your drug report surely is.

491
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:51,208
We take samples from all players
after the trial of national selection.

492
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:52,708
Your report is positive.

493
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,125
You had steroids in your system
while playing the game.

494
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,416
-Sir, I and drugs--
-You took drugs.

495
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,458
Don't act innocent now.
Both you and we know that. Understood?

496
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:10,750
Mix it.

497
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,625
Sir... sir, I didn't take drugs.

498
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,291
You get success by working hard.

499
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:39,416
Drugs can only lead to defamation.

500
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,583
You have ruined your father's honor
as well as ours.

501
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:50,250
Until today, people used to address
Sansarpur as the Mecca of hockey.

502
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,625
I don't think they will, henceforth.

503
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:56,500
Sir, I didn't do it. I didn't do it, sir.

504
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,583
Sir, I... I don't do drugs.

505
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,208
Sir...

506
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,416
Sir...

507
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,500
I don't do drugs, sir.

508
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,500
There's no use begging us.

509
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,000
You will learn your lesson
when a ten year ban is imposed on you.

510
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,666
I don't do drugs, father!

511
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,708
-Our land was already mortgaged.
-Listen to me.

512
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:28,125
For you I even mortgaged
our ancestral home.

513
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:31,791
-Believe me...
-You have killed me.

514
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:33,541
I cannot face anyone anymore.

515
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,541
Leave me alone.

516
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,041
Brother, I can't sleep.

517
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:16,916
<i>The moon</i>

518
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:21,291
<i>Can never leave the sky</i>

519
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:26,916
<i>A relationship bounded by blood</i>

520
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,208
<i>Can never break</i>

521
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,666
<i>The moon</i>

522
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:37,083
<i>Can never leave the sky</i>

523
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:41,916
<i>A relationship bounded by blood</i>

524
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,958
<i>Can never break</i>

525
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:49,958
<i>A babul tree can never provide shade</i>

526
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:54,291
<i>Like the evergreen tree</i>

527
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,583
<i>Strangers</i>

528
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:03,500
<i>Can never replace family</i>

529
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:09,125
<i>Strangers can never...</i>

530
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:51,333
<i>I swore by my wife the other day...</i>

531
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:55,208
<i>that I will never play hockey again</i>

532
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,208
And I always thought

533
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,750
that our father died in an accident.

534
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:45,000
Should I stop playing hockey?

535
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:55,958
You cannot stop playing hockey.

536
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,916
Because we have it in our blood.

537
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:05,458
But you can do a few things.

538
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,041
First, learn to pass.

539
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:11,916
And your reverse is pathetic, stupid.

540
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:33,708
Move to ring!

541
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:57,958
-Well done, my boy.
-Walk away.

542
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,041
Here you go.
Why are you lying on the ground?

543
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:30,000
<i>I just needed my brothers blessings.</i>
<i>I started attacking their goalposts.</i>

544
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:33,833
<i>I kept scoring and people</i>
<i>at the university started praising me.</i>

545
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,083
<i>Then even started mentioning me</i>
<i>in the newspapers.</i>

546
00:46:36,916 --> 00:46:39,333
<i>This made them quite jealous of me.</i>

547
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,000
Harry!

548
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:12,291
Fateh!

549
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:18,666
Fateh!

550
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:05,958
No!

551
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,625
This is how you act responsible?

552
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:53,875
This is how you act responsible?

553
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:09,166
A mistake done once
can be considered a mistake.

554
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,458
A mistake can be forgiven.

555
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:15,583
To make the same mistake again

556
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:18,666
is a well thought decision.

557
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,083
And this is the result of your decision.

558
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,333
This!

559
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:27,375
Hockey means death for our family!

560
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,791
Have you forgotten that?

561
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,000
It's good, you should forget your past.

562
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:37,750
It is a good thing.

563
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,458
But not so much of it

564
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:44,333
that you also forget your principles,
decisions and your self-respect!

565
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,333
What are you trying to do here?

566
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:48,666
Look at me...

567
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:51,750
Look at me!
What are you trying to do here?

568
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,541
You couldn't fulfill your dreams...

569
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:56,625
So you want to kill that boy?

570
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:59,208
Tell me, do you want to kill him?

571
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:01,291
Don't cry in front of me.

572
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:11,541
Who is this girl?

573
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,958
Tell her to leave! Ask her to leave!

574
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,208
They have turned their lives into a joke.

575
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,625
Hockey! Hockey! Hockey!

576
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:31,166
I am so fed up, Harry!
I am so tired of it!

577
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,625
Your responsibility, Fateh.

578
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,500
Your decision, you will bear it alone now.

579
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,125
I am leaving.

580
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,833
If it's difficult for you to do it alone
then call sister-in-law to help.

581
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:02,416
Sorry.

582
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,750
Go get it.

583
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:57,750
Try. Give it to me.

584
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,500
Fateh...

585
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,458
Go and get it.

586
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,625
Once again...

587
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:04,875
Once more...

588
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:40,750
Once again, bro...

589
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:43,833
Bro...

590
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:47,708
Once more...

591
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:16,125
<i>The moon can never leave the sky</i>

592
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:23,291
<i>A relationship bounded by blood</i>
<i>Can never break</i>

593
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:31,291

00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:37,083
<i>A relationship bounded by blood</i>

595
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:40,291

<i>Can never provide shade</i>

<i>Strangers can never replace family</i>

598
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:59,791
<i>Strangers can never...</i>

599
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,041
<i>The moon</i>

600
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:22,416

<i>Can never replace family</i>

613
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:29,875
<i>There are some relations</i>

614
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,250
<i>That break</i>

615
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:37,333
<i>Why worry about the weak relations</i>

616
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,916
<i>That break</i>

617
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,875
<i>Why worry about the weak relations</i>

618
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,416
<i>That break</i>

619
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:52,791
<i>You cannot uproot a relationship</i>

620
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:56,958

Brother!

626
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:39,250
Who is he, bro?

627
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,375
Relax.

628
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:58,500
Brother...

629
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:02,750
Watch out, bro!

630
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,583
Hey!

631
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:10,958
Hey!

632
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,875
Bro!

633
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:21,666
Bro!

634
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:25,708
Brother!

635
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:06,875
<i>The moon can never leave the sky</i>

645
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:45,958
I want to fight.

646
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:47,541
Enough!

647
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,125
No more fighting.

648
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,250
I know all this is happening
because of me.

649
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,708
Drop it, sister-in-law.

650
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:59,208
-As if you are MIG-21.
-I'll whack you!

651
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:01,958
I am talking about fighting in the court.

652
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:04,250
You are going to divorce me?

653
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,000
I am talking about
fighting against these Englishmen.

654
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,458
Let's go.

655
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,250
<i>Sister-in-law was no longer angry with us.</i>

656
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:20,833
<i>She decided</i>
<i>to take the Englishmen to court.</i>

657
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:42,875
<i>We had no idea that we would get insulted</i>

658
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:46,333
<i>by the Englishmen in the court.</i>

659
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:54,291
<i>The white advocate began the argument</i>
<i>by talking about our brown skin.</i>

660
01:01:54,708 --> 01:01:56,666
<i>He said that the brown skin</i>

661
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:59,333
<i>matches the brown bread</i>
<i>he has for breakfast.</i>

662
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:24,583
<i>The coach of England too very clearly lied</i>

663
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,458
<i>that there were two referees in the match.</i>

664
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,500
<i>And he wasn't on the ground</i>
<i>when it happened.</i>

665
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,666
<i>Hence, he couldn't see anything.</i>

666
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:52,916
<i>The second referee, that is coach Grewal,</i>
<i>the second witness and our only hope.</i>

667
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,625
<i>This hope would have been fruitful</i>

668
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,083
<i>if on the day of the attack</i>

669
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:08,416
<i>Clayton had not executed his plan well.</i>

670
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:29,458
<i>Then they misled coach Grewal...</i>

671
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,208
<i>and turned the case into their favor.</i>

672
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,416
<i>They planned, lied and won the case.</i>

673
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,416
<i>But it didn't end there.</i>
<i>All limits were crossed</i>

674
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:03,625
<i>when coach Clayton questioned</i>
<i>our pride over hockey.</i>

675
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:06,500
<i>He said, why don't you give up hockey</i>
<i>and start playing chess instead?</i>

676
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:54,625
Listen up...

677
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,958
Tell your coach and dean that
I'm going to meet them tomorrow at 11.

678
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:09,291
Fateh...

679
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,000
Harry didn't come home to eat either.

680
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:15,958
What does he want to do?

681
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,500
Harry...

682
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:29,041
Let's go.

683
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,958
Return tickets for you
and your hockey team.

684
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:53,625
And money, lodging and boarding.

685
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,166
I could have told them that
in English too.

686
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,083
But when your pride is questioned,

687
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,208
you can give a fitting reply
only in your own language.

688
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,208
Translate.

689
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:29,833
Three months from now,

690
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:32,750
your team shall play my team.

691
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,666
I sold all the four taxis.

692
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:53,958
I have done my part.

693
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:55,666
Will you be able to yours?

694
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,125
Now that our honor is at stake,

695
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:14,708
I'll even play with broken legs.

696
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:53,250
Punjab.

697
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:35,666
Bro, when will we reach Punjab?

698
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:39,333
Why? This is Punjab, why?

699
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:40,375
What, this is Punjab?

700
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,750
Where are those mustard fields?

701
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:45,500
Where are those girls
carrying cattle grass?

702
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,041
Where are those boys
with drums in their hand?

703
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,583
Where's the dance?
What kind of a Punjab is this?

704
01:08:52,416 --> 01:08:56,250
Okay, so you want the Punjab
they show in Yash Chopra's movies?

705
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:57,458
Yes, that Punjab.

706
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,166
Then get this straight.

707
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:01,333
Listen carefully now.

708
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:03,750
Mustard grows only in February and March.

709
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:07,083
And they play drums only during a wedding.
Understood?

710
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:09,416
Look ahead now.

711
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:36,916
-Hello.
-Hello.

712
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,208
God bless you, son.

713
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:39,958
-Can I go inside?
-Sure.

714
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:42,166
Go ahead.

715
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,666
Brother, why don't they show this Punjab
in the movies?

716
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:07,958
Yeah.

717
01:11:57,625 --> 01:11:59,250
Hello, brother.

718
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:01,166
Hello.

719
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:05,041
It was very dirty.
I cleaned up as much as I could.

720
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:06,166
It's okay.

721
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:07,333
Get our bags from outside.

722
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:09,458
-Hello.
-Hello.

723
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:21,291
I really wanted to cook for you
on a rural stove.

724
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:25,041
I too wanted to eat
that same food under the stars.

725
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,208
I wanted to feed you under the stars.

726
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:33,625
Both of you...

727
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:37,708
won't even be able
to get out of these cobwebs.

728
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,000
Sister-in-law, tell me.

729
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:43,208
Did he spend 150,000 pounds
to make you a lawyer

730
01:12:43,416 --> 01:12:44,833
so that you end up
cooking for him like this?

731
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:48,291
Stop romancing, Romeo and Juliet!

732
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:52,458
We have to focus on hockey.
We are here for hockey.

733
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,291
Here!

734
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:56,833
What did I say, bro?

735
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,458
Look, everyone has some dreams
he or she wishes to fulfill.

736
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:03,666
Right, Mr. Muscle? So romancing
is also one of them, right?

737
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:06,458
We have to go meet the headman. Let's go.

738
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:08,416
Let's go, come on.

739
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:13,583
Son, if you had challenged them
for a game of cards,

740
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:16,208
then we have three teams ready.

741
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Son,

742
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:22,500
you picked a big fight
without using your brains.

743
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:25,791
To know how deep the water is,

744
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,458
you first dip one foot in.

745
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,000
You don't just jump right into it.

746
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:33,250
But uncle,

747
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:36,125
you have seen the golden era
of Sansarpur's hockey.

748
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,416
It is a thing of the past, Harbir.

749
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:43,000
Now the youth only have drugs
in their blood.

750
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,583
Weren't there drugs available
during your time? There were.

751
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:47,916
This is all about emotions.

752
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,666
If we encourage the youth,
then they too will play well.

753
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:54,500
The truth is that
hockey is long dead here.

754
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:56,416
Hockey cannot die.

755
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:58,583
Hockey is in our blood.

756
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:02,208
Being in the blood doesn't matter.
It should be visible on the grounds.

757
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:05,375
We'll get it back on the ground.

758
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:09,791
Stop being stubborn, Harbir.

759
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,708
The government couldn't revive it,
you think you can?

760
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,375
Sansarpur isn't the government's village,

761
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:19,583
it's my village.

762
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:21,791
I'll bring hockey back to life.

763
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:31,791
Wait.

764
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,208
Listen up, son.
Where does the Olympian Pritpal live?

765
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,541
Gold Pritpal or bronze Pritpal?

766
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:39,875
And he said that hockey
is dead in this village.

767
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:42,416
He has all the names on his fingertips.

768
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:44,041
Gold Pritpal, son.

769
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,041
Brother, he stays there,
in the last house on the left.

770
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,583
-Let's go.
-Let me finish.

771
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,625
Otherwise, you will have to come back.

772
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:57,166
The gold medalist no longer lives
in this village.

773
01:14:57,625 --> 01:14:59,708
The bronze medalist
lives right opposite to him.

774
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,458
You should knock on his door.

775
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:02,666
Understood?

776
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,416
Understood?

777
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,083
Understood. Let's go.

778
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:07,250
-Bye.
-See you.

779
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,250
Fateh... Fateh...

780
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:15,500
Hello, sir.

781
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,833
-Hello.
-Sir, my name is Harry.

782
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,458
He is my younger brother, Fateh.

783
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:22,000
Mr. Pritpal, 1976 Olympics.

784
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:24,958
He played a very important role in it.
I am a big fan, sir.

785
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,958
Sir, we are trying to form a hockey team
in Sansarpur.

786
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,708
We want our village's name
to once again shine before the world.

787
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,083
Really?

788
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:35,958
That's a good thought.

789
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:39,333
But you are staying
in England these days, right?

790
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:40,708
Yes, sir.

791
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:45,041
You wouldn't have thought of such a thing
if you were living here.

792
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:49,083
Would you move aside, please.

793
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:00,041
Bro...

794
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:03,000
Human beings can make mistakes.

795
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:06,708
If you want, I can talk to Coach Clayton

796
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:09,541
and tell them that we are no longer angry

797
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,750
and so he too
should let go of his anger. Right?

798
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:30,708
Hello.

799
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:36,208
Actually, I want to form
a hockey team in Sansarpur.

800
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:37,875
Why?

801
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:39,875
So that the boys can play
in the nationals.

802
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:42,250
How will that help?

803
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:44,583
-They will get medals.
-And then?

804
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:49,666
Then they will play internationally
and also get medals there.

805
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:51,875
And how will that help?

806
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,750
That would be great for our village.

807
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,500
It cannot get greater than this.

808
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:18,791
<i>Oh no, the ball has hit</i>
<i>Indian goalkeeper Kular's eyes.</i>

809
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:23,041
<i>This could cost the Indian hockey team</i>
<i>a valuable goalkeeper.</i>

810
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:28,833
<i>Goalkeeper Kular's bright future</i>
<i>in hockey could seep into darkness.</i>

811
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:49,958
Stop it, Fateh. Stop doing that.
Sit back and relax.

812
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:51,916
Stop it.

813
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,625
I apologize for the mistake I never made.

814
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:37,250
And we apologize
for the mistake we perhaps made.

815
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,500
We didn't believe you.
We suspected Sansarpur.

816
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,375
Forgive us...

817
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:52,666
Because what our hearts said and
what the situation dictated didn't match.

818
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:04,125
Come here... come on.

819
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:24,500
Coach, I have heard a lot about Sansarpur.

820
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:28,125
I also heard that there
are less believers in God

821
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:30,375
and more believers of hockey.

822
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:36,583
But we still haven't found 11 people
who can play hockey here.

823
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:40,000
You need two things to play any game.

824
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,958
Talent and desire.

825
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:47,833
You can learn the talent.
But the desire comes from within.

826
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:49,750
From the time we have come here,

827
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:53,083
we haven't met a single player
who has a desire to play.

828
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:59,208
To rekindle the fire,
you need to move away the ashes.

829
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:02,041
-What do you mean?
-I know a few players.

830
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:07,625
If they are given proper training,
then they can play well.

831
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:11,291
Okay. That's great.
Let's go and meet them then.

832
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:15,500
First person, Kashmir Singh,

833
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,333
AKA Shera.

834
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:19,291
Listen up...

835
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:24,125
Don't talk about hockey in front of me.

836
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:27,458
I have played hockey for a long time.
It has no money in it.

837
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:30,166
You are NRIs.

838
01:20:31,041 --> 01:20:33,291
If someone has usurped your land,
then tell me.

839
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:36,583
-No one has usurped our land.
-Then why don't you usurp someone's?

840
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,125
Forget that. Tell us if you are interested
in playing hockey.

841
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:41,125
Do you know who I am?

842
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,958
My anger is deadly. Don't waste my time.

843
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:45,208
Leave.

844
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,083
Hockey guys...

845
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:25,750
Get up, Chhotu.

846
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:28,583
They left.

847
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:30,875
He is very scared of violence.

848
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,291
He will always run away from me.

849
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:37,291
And I think I have taught him
enough goalkeeping for you.

850
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:40,458
-Would you like to play, Chhotu?
-Yes.

851
01:21:44,791 --> 01:21:45,916
Please bring it for me.

852
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,916
-Your turban is very nice.
-Let me go.

853
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,500
I met with my soul mate in my dream.

854
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:53,375
You brought him here
so that he can stop taking drugs, right?

855
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:56,541
-What should I do?
-He will get rid of the bad habit here.

856
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,416
Back off!

857
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:00,291
Scoundrel!

858
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,333
-Why don't you get the capsules?
-My son...

859
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:06,083
-I beg to you every day.
-My boy...

860
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,750
-He takes 100 rupees from me every day.
-Calm down.

861
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:11,041
-He still doesn't get me any drugs.
-Calm down, my child.

862
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:12,708
-How can I calm down, mother?
-Calm down.

863
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,333
-I beg to him every day.
-No.

864
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:15,375
I give him money.

865
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,791
-I can't live without drugs.
-I am coming.

866
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:20,083
I met Bachchani from our village,

867
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:21,791
the addict's mother.

868
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:25,458
<i>The tong meant for fire...</i>

869
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:29,000
<i>You didn't keep me for yourself...</i>

870
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,166
<i>You didn't leave me worthy</i>
<i>Of the world either</i>

871
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,916
<i>You didn't keep me for yourself...</i>

872
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:39,416
<i>You didn't leave me worthy</i>
<i>Of the world either</i>

873
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,000
<i>You didn't leave me worthy</i>
<i>Of the world either</i>

874
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,708
-<i>My body aches</i>
-Hello, brother.

875
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,250
<i>Get me something</i>

876
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,083
Get me some?

877
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:55,083
I beg them every day.

878
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,166
Do you have anything?

879
01:22:58,708 --> 01:22:59,791
You have done drugs.

880
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,333
You have played hockey too.

881
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,916
Tell me, what was more fun?

882
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:09,375
We went to Chandigarh hockey academy.

883
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:11,291
We checked their records.

884
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:13,416
Your name is still on the top.

885
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:18,750
They said there was a boy who came
and scored four goals in 10 minutes.

886
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,083
And yet your name stays anonymous.

887
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,416
That happened four years ago.

888
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:29,708
You can never bring the past back.

889
01:23:30,541 --> 01:23:32,166
I will bring it back for you.

890
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:33,958
Will you stop taking drugs?

891
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:02,916
The 1984 riots took both my family
and hockey away from me.

892
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:08,000
Now I do not have any relationship
with anyone apart from this Gurudwara.

893
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,125
No one can fill the void left
by the family.

894
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,500
But if hockey calls out to you,

895
01:24:20,208 --> 01:24:23,375
then will you form a relationship
with it once again?

896
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:17,458
Would you like to play hockey?

897
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:21,833
I don't have time to play hockey.
I have to take care of the cattle too.

898
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:24,125
You can keep people to handle the cattle.

899
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:26,958
Like it's that easy.

900
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:28,666
Help demands money.

901
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,208
I will pay for it.

902
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:37,458
Stop, stop, stop.

903
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:39,083
Hey you, don't go offside!

904
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:41,125
Come on, leave.

905
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:43,916
Come on. Stay behind the D.

906
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,458
Yes, stay behind the D.

907
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,416
Come on, leave.

908
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:49,375
Leave? Do you want a special invite?

909
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,041
Leave already!

910
01:26:34,916 --> 01:26:37,541
I hope you remember your promise.
You will have to pay me every day.

911
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:41,708
I hope you too remember your promise.

912
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:44,041
You will also have to play every day. Go.

913
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:00,333
Listen up, everybody.

914
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:04,791
This has already been decided.

915
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,708
I don't want anyone complaining later on.

916
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:10,791
The captain of this team...

917
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:16,208
is me.

918
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:20,833
-Why would we complain?
-We are used to this.

919
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,541
The one who owns the bat
always bats first.

920
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:27,250
And sometimes also runs away
after playing his turn.

921
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:29,541
-You will have to play in turns.
-You want your turn?

922
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:31,250
Tomorrow morning, 4:30 a.m.

923
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,458
What the hell! Water!

924
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:38,625
-Run!
-Let's go!

925
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,583
-Run!
-It's time! Start running quickly!

926
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,375
Run!

927
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,416
<i>The way we completed our team,</i>
<i>with force...</i>

928
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:49,791
<i>With the same brutal force,</i>
<i>we began the training of this team.</i>

929
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,833
Run! Don't stop!

930
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:05,875
Run, run!

931
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:09,458
<i>Here we were panting</i>
<i>by running on the streets</i>

932
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:11,666
<i>and there, the English players</i>
<i>were working out in the gym</i>

933
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,541
<i>to build their muscles.</i>

934
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,791
Run, you scoundrels!

935
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:29,208
-Run!
-Let's go.

936
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:38,500
<i>The English players' diet consisted</i>
<i>of high protein supplements.</i>

937
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:41,041
<i>And our diet consisted of buffalo's milk.</i>

938
01:28:51,875 --> 01:28:53,125
This is the goalpost
and that is the target.

939
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,416
This shouldn't be seen
and the target shouldn't be missed.

940
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:58,208
I won't be happy
if the ball passes from the sides.

941
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:00,958
The ball should hit the target.
Understood?

942
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:02,708
Get on with it.

943
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:07,000
You will hit the target
if you learn how to do it.

944
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:10,166
You know your reverse is weak. Practice.

945
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:28,416
He wants to make us players.

946
01:29:28,541 --> 01:29:30,833
He should first learn to play himself,
Mr. Great Player.

947
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:34,750
Why did he call us
if he didn't want us to play?

948
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:37,625
-His technique is wrong.
-We are so tired.

949
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:49,041
-Fateh!
-Coach!

950
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:50,375
Get them stretching!

951
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:06,625
Whether I am a good person
or a bad person doesn't matter.

952
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:08,708
What matters is that I am a businessman.
Okay?

953
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:12,041
I will give your team 11 jerseys
and 11 pairs of socks.

954
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,541
But the jersey
should feature a black calf,

955
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:15,833
its face should be about this big.

956
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:17,708
Won't that make it a buffalo then?

957
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:20,083
No, it is still a calf.

958
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:22,416
One more thing.
I will provide the nutrition.

959
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:24,000
I will get you all the groceries.

960
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:26,166
And I will keep a note
of everything in my diary.

961
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,750
The bottom line,

962
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:31,500
if your team loses,
then you will have to pay for everything.

963
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:36,208
If your team wins, then I will
strike off everything from the diary.

964
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:37,500
Tell me, do you agree?

965
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:41,458
Agreed.

966
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,750
The first match takes place
in a week's time.

967
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:44,791
Don't worry, madam.

968
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:46,416
I will make all the arrangements
in a week's time.

969
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:50,250
-Let's go.
-Okay.

970
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,416
-Stop your nonsense!
-Who do you think you are?

971
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:13,666
-Go mind your own business!
-No!

972
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:14,791
-Listen...
-No! Don't!

973
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:16,083
-Damn you!
-Stop fighting!

974
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:17,625
-Wait, I'll teach you a lesson!
-Stop it! Listen to me!

975
01:31:17,916 --> 01:31:19,625
-Move aside!
-Stop it! Don't!

976
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:20,875
-Get lost!
-Don't fight.

977
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,541
Stay away from me!

978
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:24,000
-Don't fight!
-No!

979
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,875
-Listen to me!
-Let me go!

980
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:27,583
-You back off first!
-You wait, I'll teach you a lesson.

981
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:28,916
-Come here!
-Back off!

982
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,708
-He doesn't listen!
-Stop fighting!

983
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:32,041
What does he think of himself?

984
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:33,500
Come and see it for yourself then!

985
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:35,166
-Let go of my hockey stick.
-Back off, man!

986
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,708
-Give it back.
-Come here.

987
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:38,708
-Back off.
-Let me go!

988
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:41,000
-You come here! Come with me!
-Don't do this.

989
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:43,791
-To hell with the team! Useless creeps.
-It's your team.

990
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:45,875
-I know how to look after myself.
-Leave him alone.

991
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:47,125
-Go away!
-See what's happening.

992
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:48,791
-Move aside!
-You think you are a great player?

993
01:31:49,125 --> 01:31:51,666
-Let him go! Stop it!
-Who do you think you are!

994
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:53,208
-Come, teach me.
-Back off.

995
01:31:53,291 --> 01:31:54,458
-Who is he to say anything?
-Back off, man.

996
01:31:54,541 --> 01:31:55,666
-You bloody...
-Back off.

997
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,583
-No, don't hit him.
-Come here!

998
01:31:56,666 --> 01:31:58,000
-Come on!
-He won't learn a lesson otherwise.

999
01:31:58,083 --> 01:31:59,458
-I said come here!
-I will break your head!

1000
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:01,000
-Go and teach him.
-Come here.

1001
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:03,250
-What are you doing, guys? Come here.
-I know what I am doing.

1002
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:04,791
Come on, come with me.
Come on, let him go.

1003
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,416
-Let each other go now.
-Get lost!

1004
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,958
-Come on.
-Let him go, man. Don't do this.

1005
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:08,958
-Tell him!
-Stop it.

1006
01:32:50,333 --> 01:32:51,625
Well, I'll tell you what...

1007
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:18,083
Well, the stadium is...

1008
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,500
not filled with spectators.

1009
01:33:21,083 --> 01:33:25,333
But I welcome the one or two people
who have come here.

1010
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,916
Brother, we should have invited
Harman Cheema, the singer, instead.

1011
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,125
We would have easily had
an audience of 100 at least.

1012
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:30,875
Shut up. He wants to invite Harman Cheema.

1013
01:33:31,125 --> 01:33:33,958
There, both the teams are on the ground.

1014
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:43,416
Let me introduce you to Sansarpur's team.

1015
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,708
-Okay.
-The first player is its captain,

1016
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:46,750
Fateh Singh.

1017
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,791
Kang, Bains...

1018
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,916
Singh, Grewal...

1019
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:55,166
Sidhu, Pulsiya, Baba, Kullar...

1020
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:58,708
Baamanh, Panchi, Zavar, Vespa,

1021
01:33:58,791 --> 01:34:01,750
Dodhi, Pala and Amli.

1022
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:11,958
Brother, are they players
or their attributes?

1023
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:12,875
Shut up.

1024
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:14,375
There you go.

1025
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:17,500
Now I will introduce you
to the English team.

1026
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,333
This is how their team goes.

1027
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:26,166
Now do I have to say all the names?
You too say a few.

1028
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:31,083
There you go then. I am going to
introduce you to the English team.

1029
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:33,916
V... W... I...

1030
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:36,291
First Englishman, second Englishman,

1031
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:38,833
third Englishman,
fourth Englishman, fifth Englishman...

1032
01:34:38,916 --> 01:34:41,625
And six other Englishmen,
so that means 11 Englishmen.

1033
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:43,041
-Yes.
-Well done, brother.

1034
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:48,416
These English always think...

1035
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:53,166
that we Indians can play better
than them only on grass

1036
01:34:53,666 --> 01:34:56,208
and that they are better than us
while playing on the turf.

1037
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:01,208
That's why Harry has decided
that we will play on the turf.

1038
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:03,958
So that they don't have any doubts left.

1039
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:12,500
The result of the tournament
will be based on three matches.

1040
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:14,833
Both the teams will play three matches.

1041
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:18,875
The team which wins two matches
will be declared the winner.

1042
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,166
Pargat...

1043
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:28,250
The stadium is absolutely empty.

1044
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:31,125
I'm sure there are a few people
in our village who are sitting idle.

1045
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:35,833
Today, even idlers are busy.
Cricket match.

1046
01:35:43,125 --> 01:35:45,083
Why is that man whistling at me?

1047
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:46,875
Brother, the match has begun.

1048
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:48,625
Without our permission?

1049
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:57,000
-No!
-Brother, the match ended as well!

1050
01:35:57,291 --> 01:35:58,750
Good job, brother.

1051
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:03,166
Don't worry.
We will score a goal in the next match.

1052
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:15,625
Play carefully!

1053
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:20,375
What? Two goals in two minutes?

1054
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:25,583
They have got an opportunity.

1055
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:26,625
Albeit thanks
to the English player's mistake.

1056
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:27,666
Yes. Let's see.

1057
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:33,208
Go! Go! Go! Go for it, Fateh!

1058
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,250
Hit it hard, Fateh!

1059
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:59,041
Should we stay or leave?

1060
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:00,083
Let's go and watch cricket?

1061
01:37:00,166 --> 01:37:02,708
Don't worry.
They have just scored two goals so far.

1062
01:37:06,916 --> 01:37:08,250
There's the third one.

1063
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:18,416
Well played. Well played.

1064
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:19,666
Very good.

1065
01:37:20,375 --> 01:37:21,250
Well played, Fateh.

1066
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:25,291
Congratulations.

1067
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:27,666
That's what I am going to tell you.

1068
01:37:33,208 --> 01:37:34,375
Hey, pass the ball.

1069
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:37,708
Grewal, lift it.

1070
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:40,208
Pass the ball to Amli.

1071
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:41,791
Come on.

1072
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:43,208
Go for it.

1073
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:47,041
Take it.

1074
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,458
No, our players have no spark in them.

1075
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:54,708
We should follow my advice of watching
the cricket match instead. Let's go?

1076
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:57,125
I think the English players
are playing amongst themselves.

1077
01:37:57,666 --> 01:38:00,250
I've only seen the Sansarpur team
talking or arguing with each other.

1078
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:01,583
True.

1079
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:11,916
Look at that.

1080
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:28,416
Amli!

1081
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:30,750
Come forward!

1082
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,541
So, what do you say?

1083
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:02,250
They might not have the fire
but they do have a spark in them.

1084
01:39:02,333 --> 01:39:03,375
Yes.

1085
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,791
Brother?
You don't need to get so emotional.

1086
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,541
They scored only one goal
whereas the English team scored four.

1087
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:29,291
You are feeling embarrassed?

1088
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:32,125
You should.

1089
01:39:33,125 --> 01:39:35,458
Remember the game you played
in the last 35 minutes.

1090
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:37,916
Maybe then you won't feel embarrassed
in the next game.

1091
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:42,000
Let's go.

1092
01:39:56,333 --> 01:39:58,500
-Is this necessary?
-Of course it is.

1093
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:00,000
We are not here to promote you guys.

1094
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:01,583
We are here
to promote pure clarified butter,

1095
01:40:01,666 --> 01:40:03,375
black calf pure clarified butter.

1096
01:40:03,458 --> 01:40:05,250
And whatever little you guys played,

1097
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,458
it was because of this clarified butter.
Got it?

1098
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:08,708
Come here, my child.

1099
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:10,916
We played because of the clarified butter.

1100
01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:14,958
Anyway, we saw your black calf more
on the ground than the ball.

1101
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:27,375
I have made his favorite, rice pudding.

1102
01:40:28,708 --> 01:40:30,541
I think I have added
a little too much sugar in it.

1103
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,875
It's okay.

1104
01:40:35,291 --> 01:40:37,458
He likes it sweet.

1105
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:46,916
I am taking rice pudding... for my son.

1106
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:51,375
My son made everyone shut up.

1107
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,208
He scored a goal.

1108
01:40:54,625 --> 01:40:56,666
They all used to taunt me.

1109
01:40:56,958 --> 01:41:00,666
They used to call me the addict's mother.

1110
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:05,250
My son scored a goal. One goal.

1111
01:41:05,416 --> 01:41:07,833
My son scored a goal. Ginni scored.

1112
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:22,250
I have made rice pudding for Ginni

1113
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,250
and my other boys.

1114
01:41:25,041 --> 01:41:26,791
Thank you for the trouble you took, aunt.

1115
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,666
They will wipe it out in no time.

1116
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:31,958
I know my army.

1117
01:41:32,416 --> 01:41:34,791
I too know my village.

1118
01:41:35,125 --> 01:41:37,625
There will be a lot coming for them.

1119
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,083
It's too sweet, mother.

1120
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,833
You always said I added less sugar.

1121
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:20,416
You have become a big player now.

1122
01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:23,416
You should always play like this
in the future.

1123
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,458
I will play even better than this.

1124
01:42:27,583 --> 01:42:31,000
I have made you suffer a lot.
I have troubled you a lot. Right?

1125
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,250
You used to always look down
and walk out of the house

1126
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:39,166
because you thought that people would
say, "Look, that's the addict's mother."

1127
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:43,125
You no longer need to look down.

1128
01:42:43,458 --> 01:42:45,166
You should now leave the house
with your head held high.

1129
01:42:45,708 --> 01:42:49,416
Because you are now
Ginni left out's mother,

1130
01:42:49,916 --> 01:42:51,166
Ginni striker's mother.

1131
01:42:58,125 --> 01:43:00,500
By the way, the sugar in it is just right.

1132
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:39,333
I've come to know
the value of respect, coach.

1133
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,791
I no longer need this.

1134
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:46,666
Please take it back, it's a request.

1135
01:43:57,875 --> 01:43:59,708
Can you two come out for just a second?

1136
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:01,125
Let's go.

1137
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:09,791
Hey, Harry!

1138
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:13,750
You are a very good player,
but you are just an okay coach.

1139
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:17,083
Right.

1140
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,083
Tomorrow morning, 4:00 a.m.,

1141
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:36,333
<i>You cannot lose and give up</i>
<i>You have to win</i>

1142
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:40,250
<i>No one should be able to stop you</i>
<i>Run like the wind</i>

1143
01:45:40,625 --> 01:45:44,333
<i>Don't feel low boys, make some noise</i>

1144
01:45:44,583 --> 01:45:47,791
<i>Play a game that everybody enjoys</i>

1145
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:52,583
<i>It's time for you to give it your best</i>

1146
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:55,958
<i>And work harder</i>

1147
01:45:56,625 --> 01:45:59,375
<i>It's time for you to give it your best...</i>

1148
01:45:59,625 --> 01:46:00,916
Come on, keep it up.

1149
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,583
<i>It's time for you to give it your best</i>
<i>And work harder</i>

1150
01:46:07,416 --> 01:46:09,666
You have only 16 yards

1151
01:46:09,791 --> 01:46:12,500
and five players to stop the ball.

1152
01:46:13,208 --> 01:46:16,458
-Fateh. The speed of your push...
-Yes.

1153
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:20,875
...shall decide how much time
you give the scorer to set his angle.

1154
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:24,166
<i>One day everyone shall be proud of you</i>

1155
01:46:24,958 --> 01:46:26,875
<i>The world will rejoice your victory</i>

1156
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:29,000
<i>They will welcome you with open arms</i>

1157
01:46:29,333 --> 01:46:32,208
<i>One day you too will shine brightly</i>

1158
01:46:32,708 --> 01:46:34,375
<i>The world will then belong to you</i>

1159
01:46:34,458 --> 01:46:37,083
<i>They will welcome you with open arms</i>

1160
01:46:37,166 --> 01:46:41,208
<i>Make a record no one can break</i>

1161
01:46:41,416 --> 01:46:45,125
<i>To win, give whatever it takes</i>

1162
01:46:45,208 --> 01:46:49,000
<i>It's time for you to give it your best</i>

1163
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:53,250
<i>And work harder</i>

1164
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:57,208
<i>It's time for you to give it your best</i>

1165
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:01,916
<i>And work harder</i>

1166
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:26,541
Brother, what is he saying?

1167
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:28,708
Tell them what you said.

1168
01:47:32,916 --> 01:47:33,958
Did you understand?

1169
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:36,000
I just understood "home."

1170
01:47:36,625 --> 01:47:39,208
Coach, he understood home.

1171
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,791
Now we go back home...

1172
01:47:43,041 --> 01:47:44,416
only after winning the match.

1173
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:48,875
Do you remember the last 35 minutes
of the last match?

1174
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:49,791
Yes, we do.

1175
01:47:49,875 --> 01:47:52,333
That is how you have to play
these 70 minutes today.

1176
01:47:57,833 --> 01:48:00,208
No one comes to watch them play hockey
during the day

1177
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:01,125
and this match is taking place at night.

1178
01:48:01,833 --> 01:48:03,375
This is cheating.

1179
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:12,333
To all those who didn't come
to watch the match,

1180
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,375
I, the commentator forced to be here,
welcomes you.

1181
01:48:15,166 --> 01:48:16,750
There is no one here to listen to me

1182
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:19,458
but I will continue the tradition anyway.

1183
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:20,875
I would like to tell the spectators

1184
01:48:20,958 --> 01:48:23,083
that there has been no changes made
in Sansarpur's team today.

1185
01:48:23,375 --> 01:48:24,500
How can there be any changes, brother?

1186
01:48:24,583 --> 01:48:25,458
These are the same great warriors

1187
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:29,541
who were wiped out by white players
on a bright sunny day.

1188
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:30,791
Dodhi...

1189
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,208
Baba...

1190
01:48:53,666 --> 01:48:54,666
Baba!

1191
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:04,375
Yes!

1192
01:49:05,541 --> 01:49:08,333
That's Punjab's first goal made
in the first minute.

1193
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:11,416
Brother, let's make sure
they didn't hit it in our own side.

1194
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,000
It's the referee
who is making sure of that.

1195
01:49:13,083 --> 01:49:14,875
You should look at the scoreboard.

1196
01:49:18,375 --> 01:49:20,833
The atmosphere in the stadium
is now at its best.

1197
01:49:20,916 --> 01:49:23,375
The England players
are abusing each other in English.

1198
01:49:23,916 --> 01:49:25,541
Thank God they are doing it in English.

1199
01:49:25,625 --> 01:49:26,625
If they were saying it in Punjabi,

1200
01:49:26,708 --> 01:49:27,833
then it would have changed
the atmosphere of the ground.

1201
01:49:28,666 --> 01:49:30,333
-Grab it.
-Good.

1202
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:32,125
Yes, yes.

1203
01:49:32,375 --> 01:49:33,833
Back off.

1204
01:49:33,916 --> 01:49:34,958
Keep strong, stay strong.

1205
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:46,458
-Not good, boys!
-Okay, the score is tied now.

1206
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:49,083
England one, Punjab one.

1207
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:50,250
Brother,

1208
01:49:50,875 --> 01:49:52,750
I think

1209
01:49:52,833 --> 01:49:56,125
now England
will keep scoring goals nonstop.

1210
01:49:59,708 --> 01:50:00,791
Stay away.

1211
01:50:04,208 --> 01:50:05,333
-What's this?
-I know their tactics.

1212
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:08,583
They did the same thing with Holland
in the last World Cup.

1213
01:50:08,833 --> 01:50:10,041
This is nothing new.

1214
01:50:10,208 --> 01:50:12,666
They are only doing this
to break the confidence of our team.

1215
01:50:16,333 --> 01:50:17,250
Come on!

1216
01:50:39,416 --> 01:50:40,291
-Hey!
-Go for it!

1217
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:41,916
Well done!

1218
01:51:26,291 --> 01:51:28,416
Boys from our village are playing hockey!

1219
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:30,416
Come out!

1220
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:33,708
Boys from our village are playing hockey!
Let's go!

1221
01:51:34,208 --> 01:51:35,833
Boys from our village are playing hockey!

1222
01:51:36,416 --> 01:51:38,291
Let's go watch them play!

1223
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,708
Come with me!

1224
01:51:56,833 --> 01:52:00,083
I think I am having trouble seeing.
Look over there!

1225
01:52:00,166 --> 01:52:02,250
Spectators are rushing into the stadium.

1226
01:52:02,333 --> 01:52:04,625
Brother, there are many
who do sleepwalking.

1227
01:52:04,708 --> 01:52:07,458
Shut up. I think Fateh's goals
have attracted people

1228
01:52:07,541 --> 01:52:09,416
from Mithapurm, Khusropur, Kartarpur

1229
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,916
and other neighboring villages.

1230
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,916
Brother, the way people
are filling up the stadium,

1231
01:52:14,291 --> 01:52:16,083
we can now proudly say

1232
01:52:16,166 --> 01:52:19,750
that the stadium
is filled with spectators.

1233
01:52:25,125 --> 01:52:27,791
-Here, Goddess's lion has also joined us.
-Hail the Goddess!

1234
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:29,250
I mean it has come to the stadium.

1235
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:32,166
And also the guy
who distributes the offerings.

1236
01:52:33,708 --> 01:52:35,916
Forget about the offerings.
I think as the number of spectators rises,

1237
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,291
The Punjab's pressure
on the game is also rising.

1238
01:52:44,125 --> 01:52:45,166
No!

1239
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:50,541
England scored another goal
and once again tied the match.

1240
01:52:50,625 --> 01:52:53,291
There are only a few minutes left
in the game.

1241
01:52:53,375 --> 01:52:55,916
Punjab needs a miracle to win this match.

1242
01:52:56,333 --> 01:52:57,541
A miracle is required here.

1243
01:53:05,583 --> 01:53:07,000
Ask the Englishmen to go away!

1244
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:08,791
Ask the Englishmen to go away!

1245
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:11,083
Ask the Englishmen to go away!

1246
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,625
-Dodhi!
-Come on, Dodhi!

1247
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:01,500
Yes!

1248
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:03,583
-Yahoo!
-We did it!

1249
01:54:28,708 --> 01:54:31,583
<i>You now have the reins to the country</i>

1250
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:35,833
<i>You can either help it progress or ruin it</i>

1251
01:54:37,416 --> 01:54:39,541
<i>You now have the reins to the country</i>

1252
01:54:39,625 --> 01:54:41,666
<i>You can either help it progress or ruin it</i>

1253
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,958
<i>Be one with the ground</i>

1254
01:54:45,083 --> 01:54:48,916
<i>Fill the stadium with power</i>

1255
01:54:50,625 --> 01:54:52,416
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1256
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:54,666
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1257
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:58,750
<i>Now hockey will score!</i>

1258
01:54:59,416 --> 01:55:01,458
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1259
01:55:01,541 --> 01:55:04,000
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1260
01:55:04,375 --> 01:55:08,166
<i>It will reign some more!</i>

1261
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:10,791
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1262
01:55:11,291 --> 01:55:15,166
<i>The whole team got a new lease on life</i>
<i>after winning the second match.</i>

1263
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:19,083
<i>Now it was time for the last</i>
<i>and final match.</i>

1264
01:55:42,833 --> 01:55:44,375
I didn't even tell you.

1265
01:55:46,916 --> 01:55:49,250
Then how did you know that I needed you?

1266
01:55:51,208 --> 01:55:52,833
You needed me, right?

1267
01:56:07,333 --> 01:56:08,583
<i>After losing the second match,</i>

1268
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:12,166
<i>Coach Clayton went back</i>
<i>to his evil cruel tactics.</i>

1269
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:16,000
<i>Once again he decided</i>
<i>to injure the players.</i>

1270
01:56:26,166 --> 01:56:29,750
<i>He targeted all</i>
<i>the main players of Punjab.</i>

1271
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:31,333
<i>He said</i>

1272
01:56:31,875 --> 01:56:34,375
<i>that it is important</i>
<i>that they break our team.</i>

1273
01:56:40,625 --> 01:56:42,958
<i>And this time, his target was Dodhi.</i>

1274
01:57:40,125 --> 01:57:41,916
<i>This sight is worth watching.</i>

1275
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,958
<i>With the number of spectators here</i>
<i>for the match,</i>

1276
01:57:44,041 --> 01:57:47,000
<i>this looks more like a funfair</i>
<i>than a hockey match.</i>

1277
01:57:47,666 --> 01:57:49,333
<i>People have come here</i>
<i>in tractors and trolleys.</i>

1278
01:57:49,416 --> 01:57:51,416
<i>And then there are also those</i>
<i>in cycles who have come here</i>

1279
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:53,833
<i>holding the sides of</i>
<i>trolleys to enjoy the match.</i>

1280
01:57:53,916 --> 01:57:55,875
<i>Going by the number of</i>
<i>news channel reporters here,</i>

1281
01:57:56,208 --> 01:57:57,625
<i>it's not just Fateh or Harry,</i>

1282
01:57:57,708 --> 01:57:59,833
<i>or Punjab's honor</i>
<i>that is at stake anymore.</i>

1283
01:57:59,916 --> 01:58:02,583
<i>Our country's honor is at stake now.</i>

1284
01:58:06,541 --> 01:58:08,708
Do you know about sportsman spirit?

1285
01:58:09,375 --> 01:58:11,125
I have heard the world say...

1286
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:14,000
that victory and defeat...

1287
01:58:14,833 --> 01:58:18,041
are an integral part
of the sportsman's life

1288
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:20,833
just like dawn and dusk.

1289
01:58:23,416 --> 01:58:25,833
When you accept your defeat with honor,
it is called sportsman spirit.

1290
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:31,041
But I don't believe in that.

1291
01:58:40,916 --> 01:58:42,916
Why does an army enters a battleground?

1292
01:58:44,875 --> 01:58:45,750
To win.

1293
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:47,833
Only to win.

1294
01:58:48,458 --> 01:58:50,625
To win it at any cost.

1295
01:58:53,375 --> 01:58:58,333
Does the army give up
just because it is tired, injured

1296
01:58:58,416 --> 01:58:59,500
or out of ammunition?

1297
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:03,791
Did they accept losing?

1298
01:59:04,083 --> 01:59:04,916
Never!

1299
01:59:07,625 --> 01:59:09,916
They win, at any cost and any condition.

1300
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,833
For their country,
for their family, for their Punjab.

1301
01:59:15,208 --> 01:59:18,333
That's how a sportsman is too
when he enters the ground.

1302
01:59:19,083 --> 01:59:20,958
And that for me is the sportsman spirit.

1303
01:59:22,458 --> 01:59:24,458
At least for me this is what it means.

1304
01:59:26,791 --> 01:59:30,000
If anyone feels that this
is my personal challenge to that team,

1305
01:59:30,750 --> 01:59:31,875
then he should not play today.

1306
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:34,875
If anyone thinks that this is
Fateh's personal fight with that team,

1307
01:59:34,958 --> 01:59:36,416
then he should not play today.

1308
01:59:37,416 --> 01:59:40,458
If anyone thinks that he is doing
a favor to our village, our Punjab,

1309
01:59:40,541 --> 01:59:42,625
then he should not play today.

1310
01:59:44,958 --> 01:59:48,875
If you don't think you are a team
then you won't win.

1311
01:59:51,458 --> 01:59:53,875
Each one of you is a team.

1312
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:56,125
Dodhi, you are a team.

1313
01:59:57,791 --> 01:59:59,666
Pala, Panchi, Fateh...

1314
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:03,000
Each of you is a team.
A team of 11 players.

1315
02:00:04,625 --> 02:00:07,083
Players step inside a ground
for their honor,

1316
02:00:07,833 --> 02:00:09,250
for their passion,

1317
02:00:09,666 --> 02:00:12,500
for the fire in them.

1318
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:17,125
Players don't win the game,
the fire in them does.

1319
02:00:17,416 --> 02:00:18,875
Their passion wins.

1320
02:00:19,833 --> 02:00:21,875
The thirst to prove themselves wins.

1321
02:00:21,958 --> 02:00:23,583
-Do you have that passion in you?
-Yes, I do!

1322
02:00:23,666 --> 02:00:25,083
-Do you have the desire?
-Yes, I do!

1323
02:00:25,166 --> 02:00:26,750
-Do you have the thirst?
-Yes, I do!

1324
02:00:26,833 --> 02:00:29,291
Then go and show it to those Englishmen!

1325
02:00:29,458 --> 02:00:31,000
Dear God, grant my request so that...

1326
02:00:31,083 --> 02:00:32,583
I may never deviate from doing good deeds!

1327
02:00:32,666 --> 02:00:34,583
That I shall have no fear
of the enemy when I go into battle!

1328
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:36,041
With determination, I will be victorious!

1329
02:00:36,125 --> 02:00:37,833
"With determination,
I will be victorious!"

1330
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:41,083
With determination, I will be victorious!
With determination, I will be victorious!

1331
02:00:41,166 --> 02:00:44,291
With determination, I will be victorious!
With determination, I will be victorious!

1332
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:44,125
Friends,

1333
02:02:45,791 --> 02:02:50,750
we know how eager all of you are
to watch today's match.

1334
02:02:51,166 --> 02:02:54,583
But we are waiting for a special guest.

1335
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,125
For the world,
hockey is just another game.

1336
02:02:59,208 --> 02:03:02,875
But for Punjabis, it is an emotion.

1337
02:03:04,083 --> 02:03:08,666
It doesn't matter whether it's on this
side of the border or on the other side.

1338
02:03:09,916 --> 02:03:15,125
Please welcome Mr. Parvez Rana
from Lahore, Pakistan.

1339
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,166
Welcome, Mr. Rana.

1340
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,500
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

1341
02:03:29,833 --> 02:03:33,583
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

1342
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:37,833
Come on.

1343
02:03:39,208 --> 02:03:41,125
-Before the partition...
-Here.

1344
02:03:41,291 --> 02:03:44,000
In undivided India,

1345
02:03:44,666 --> 02:03:47,500
his father used to play
with Major Dhyan Chand.

1346
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:52,250
And he too played in Pakistan's team.

1347
02:03:52,916 --> 02:03:54,708
And now

1348
02:03:55,458 --> 02:03:57,958
his children continue with the tradition.

1349
02:04:00,541 --> 02:04:01,750
Thank you very much.

1350
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:07,000
Our country was formed in the year 1947.

1351
02:04:07,916 --> 02:04:09,541
The friends who used to play together

1352
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,208
got divided into two different teams.

1353
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:13,750
The colors of our jerseys changed.

1354
02:04:14,083 --> 02:04:17,083
But the hearts of those
who played hockey didn't change.

1355
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:21,375
In the year 1948,
during the London Olympics,

1356
02:04:21,791 --> 02:04:23,791
when India defeated England,

1357
02:04:24,041 --> 02:04:27,791
it was the Pakistani team

1358
02:04:28,916 --> 02:04:34,000
who applauded the most in the stadium.

1359
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:46,208
Back then,

1360
02:04:47,583 --> 02:04:49,583
I was just a small child...

1361
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:53,250
when I witnessed that moment.

1362
02:04:54,208 --> 02:04:58,250
Today, I am once again that small child

1363
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:02,333
and I want to live that same moment again.

1364
02:05:02,416 --> 02:05:03,458
That same moment...

1365
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:16,541
Each tear is a prayer
for the wellbeing of both Punjab.

1366
02:05:17,333 --> 02:05:20,500
Thank you, Mr. Parvez Rana.

1367
02:05:31,750 --> 02:05:32,791
<i>The match begins.</i>

1368
02:05:32,875 --> 02:05:34,875
<i>Both teams are quite enthusiastic.</i>

1369
02:05:34,958 --> 02:05:37,375
<i>Which team takes the lead in the match</i>
<i>will be decided by the first goal.</i>

1370
02:05:38,291 --> 02:05:41,541
<i>England's team always likes to build</i>
<i>the pressure from the very beginning.</i>

1371
02:05:41,625 --> 02:05:43,833
<i>And this style suits them.</i>

1372
02:05:43,916 --> 02:05:45,708
<i>But the running clock is always</i>
<i>with that team,</i>

1373
02:05:45,791 --> 02:05:49,333
<i>which is ahead at running score.</i>

1374
02:05:53,208 --> 02:05:56,125
<i>England is trying its best</i>
<i>to take the lead in the game.</i>

1375
02:05:56,208 --> 02:05:58,916
<i>Punjab's defense is much better</i>
<i>than before.</i>

1376
02:05:59,125 --> 02:06:00,958
<i>There, they break through their defense</i>
<i>and score a goal!</i>

1377
02:06:03,916 --> 02:06:06,500
<i>England scores the first goal</i>
<i>in this match.</i>

1378
02:06:06,583 --> 02:06:09,375
<i>England team's Coach Clayton</i>
<i>is quite pleased with his team.</i>

1379
02:06:09,458 --> 02:06:12,250
<i>And Punjab's coach Harry</i>
<i>looks a little disappointed.</i>

1380
02:06:12,541 --> 02:06:14,250
<i>It's halftime and the score is 1-0.</i>

1381
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,291
<i>England maintains its lead.</i>

1382
02:06:16,833 --> 02:06:20,666
<i>But in the end, it all comes down</i>
<i>to the game each team plays.</i>

1383
02:06:21,125 --> 02:06:25,708
<i>On one hand, we have players</i>
<i>from England who are quite skilled</i>

1384
02:06:25,791 --> 02:06:27,750
<i>and on the other hand,</i>
<i>there's Punjabi blood,</i>

1385
02:06:27,833 --> 02:06:29,875
<i>who have hockey in every pore</i>
<i>of their body.</i>

1386
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:34,125
<i>Our elders still remember</i>
<i>the time when their sisters</i>

1387
02:06:34,458 --> 02:06:35,875
used to stitch a ball for them with rags.

1388
02:06:49,125 --> 02:06:52,208
Happy honestly feels that if the person
suggested by him cannot do the job,

1389
02:06:52,375 --> 02:06:53,250
then he will do the job himself.

1390
02:06:53,541 --> 02:06:55,000
-Who is Happy?
-Me.

1391
02:06:55,416 --> 02:06:56,375
First get rid of your ego.

1392
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,791
I once again feel like playing hockey.
Please let me play.

1393
02:07:05,125 --> 02:07:06,208
Coach...

1394
02:07:07,583 --> 02:07:08,416
Come on.

1395
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:13,166
The score during halftime is 1-0.

1396
02:07:13,541 --> 02:07:14,791
That means England is leading

1397
02:07:14,875 --> 02:07:17,666
and now the pressure
is on Sansarpur, Punjab.

1398
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,416
Players use up most of their strength
during the first half.

1399
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:24,541
There is just one thought
that keeps him going.

1400
02:07:25,458 --> 02:07:28,500
That fate won't decide who will win,

1401
02:07:28,583 --> 02:07:31,583
his prowess will. Right?

1402
02:07:33,333 --> 02:07:36,083
Without a doubt, Punjab's teamwork
is much better than before.

1403
02:07:36,166 --> 02:07:37,750
And they are filled with passion
and determination as well.

1404
02:07:38,083 --> 02:07:40,000
But because of their skill
and their experience,

1405
02:07:40,083 --> 02:07:43,125
England has been always proving
that they are better.

1406
02:07:50,458 --> 02:07:52,083
England scored another goal.

1407
02:07:52,166 --> 02:07:54,458
England two, Punjab zero.

1408
02:07:56,541 --> 02:07:57,541
Hey, where you off to?

1409
02:08:05,791 --> 02:08:06,750
Sorry, brother.

1410
02:08:20,041 --> 02:08:22,541
I think Harry and Fateh are coming up
with a new strategy.

1411
02:08:24,166 --> 02:08:25,208
Will you be able to play outside?

1412
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Leaving the goal open?

1413
02:08:29,041 --> 02:08:31,583
Not just the goal but that as well.

1414
02:08:36,541 --> 02:08:37,458
Yes, brother.

1415
02:08:40,291 --> 02:08:41,125
Good.

1416
02:08:47,541 --> 02:08:49,208
He is making the goalkeeper stand outside.

1417
02:08:52,041 --> 02:08:53,791
Very few people know this rule in hockey.

1418
02:08:53,875 --> 02:08:58,000
And it is rarely used as well.

1419
02:08:58,291 --> 02:08:59,125
You are absolutely right.

1420
02:08:59,416 --> 02:09:01,166
-The benefit of that is...
-Buck up! Buck up!

1421
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:04,291
You get one extra player
than the other team.

1422
02:09:04,583 --> 02:09:05,791
And the disadvantage

1423
02:09:06,416 --> 02:09:10,000
is that once the defense line is crossed,
the other team scores.

1424
02:09:22,375 --> 02:09:24,875
Another excellent move by Dodhi,
a player from Punjab.

1425
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:35,708
Fateh!

1426
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:39,208
A new pass, right to the center of D.

1427
02:09:43,291 --> 02:09:45,416
Fateh deflects with a great dive.

1428
02:09:45,791 --> 02:09:47,875
And he scores a goal!

1429
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:06,583
Yeah...

1430
02:10:12,708 --> 02:10:16,083
By the way, such a risky decision
can be taken only for two reasons.

1431
02:10:16,541 --> 02:10:19,250
Either out of fear or out of greed.

1432
02:10:20,125 --> 02:10:21,833
Or for some other reason.

1433
02:10:22,375 --> 02:10:24,291
It's now or never.

1434
02:10:39,083 --> 02:10:41,416
-Pressure them.
-Okay, the referee has indicated a foul.

1435
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:42,583
It is a clear foul.

1436
02:10:42,666 --> 02:10:46,291
But England's jersey number 13,
Billbong, is arguing with the referee.

1437
02:10:46,375 --> 02:10:47,250
He is trying to defend himself.

1438
02:10:47,666 --> 02:10:49,458
But the referee has given
a short corner to Punjab.

1439
02:10:51,833 --> 02:10:53,166
Fateh is ready to push.

1440
02:10:58,125 --> 02:11:02,583
Dodhi dodged instead of going
for a direct hit and he scored!

1441
02:11:06,958 --> 02:11:08,000
Yes.

1442
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:17,458
Yes!

1443
02:11:18,083 --> 02:11:19,416
It's a goal.

1444
02:11:26,333 --> 02:11:28,333
Brother, shall I go back to the goal?

1445
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:41,750
No.

1446
02:11:43,666 --> 02:11:44,708
Think it over, brother.

1447
02:11:45,208 --> 02:11:48,958
We have equaled the score to two each.
Your planning succeeded.

1448
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:51,333
I think we shouldn't leave
the goal vulnerable anymore.

1449
02:11:53,166 --> 02:11:54,875
If a lion worries about his den
when he goes out to hunt,

1450
02:11:56,166 --> 02:11:57,916
then there won't be any difference

1451
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:02,458
in a lion's den and a mouse's burrow.

1452
02:12:03,916 --> 02:12:04,916
Keep playing.

1453
02:12:13,250 --> 02:12:15,916
-Wait, I'll teach you a lesson.
-Hey, stop it.

1454
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:17,250
Jonathan...

1455
02:12:54,166 --> 02:12:57,458
Oh no, Punjab's player, Baba,
has been injured.

1456
02:12:57,541 --> 02:13:00,250
He has been a pillar for his team.

1457
02:13:00,333 --> 02:13:02,416
Baba? You alright?

1458
02:13:03,458 --> 02:13:06,500
This is against sportsman spirit.
A deliberate act.

1459
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:09,708
If Baba, who has been playing well,
leaves the ground,

1460
02:13:09,791 --> 02:13:11,916
then it would affect Punjab's team
in a bad way.

1461
02:13:12,291 --> 02:13:14,416
We will have to take him
to the hospital right away.

1462
02:13:15,333 --> 02:13:18,958
Doctor, at an age when people play cards
at the village square,

1463
02:13:19,041 --> 02:13:20,458
I got injured in a ground.
I am requesting you,

1464
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:23,000
there are only 20 minutes
left in the game.

1465
02:13:23,250 --> 02:13:27,041
If you let me stay in the ground,
then perhaps it won't hurt me much.

1466
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
-Baba, are you alright?
-Yes, I am fine.

1467
02:13:35,416 --> 02:13:38,583
Remember, your jersey has written
<i>Fateh</i> (victory) on it. Don't forget that.

1468
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:43,625
Yes!

1469
02:13:43,708 --> 02:13:45,500
This is how a sportsman behaves!

1470
02:14:11,166 --> 02:14:14,125
<i>You now have the reins to the country</i>

1471
02:14:15,541 --> 02:14:19,416
<i>You can either help it progress or ruin it</i>

1472
02:14:19,958 --> 02:14:22,041
<i>You now have the reins to the country</i>

1473
02:14:22,125 --> 02:14:24,000
<i>You can either help it progress or ruin it</i>

1474
02:14:24,708 --> 02:14:26,666
<i>Be one with the ground</i>

1475
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:27,583
Give it here.

1476
02:14:27,666 --> 02:14:30,166
<i>Fill the stadium with power</i>

1477
02:14:39,458 --> 02:14:40,750
And here is

1478
02:14:42,375 --> 02:14:45,291
<i>Oh my dear country...</i>

1479
02:14:45,375 --> 02:14:47,208
Punjab scores this time.

1480
02:14:47,291 --> 02:14:51,000
<i>Now hockey will score!</i>

1481
02:14:51,083 --> 02:14:53,250
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1482
02:14:53,583 --> 02:14:55,958
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1483
02:14:56,041 --> 02:14:59,958
-Fateh and Harry are celebrating.
-<i>It will reign some more!</i>

1484
02:15:00,041 --> 02:15:01,875
<i>Oh my dear country...</i>

1485
02:15:01,958 --> 02:15:03,541
Thank you, God.

1486
02:15:05,166 --> 02:15:06,708
His bravery worked well.

1487
02:15:06,958 --> 02:15:07,833
Yes, indeed.

1488
02:15:08,291 --> 02:15:11,000
-But it was quite risky, wasn't it?
-That is true.

1489
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,875
At the moment,
Punjab is leading the scoreboard.

1490
02:15:19,958 --> 02:15:23,666
I think Punjab is just a few minutes away
from its victory.

1491
02:15:23,958 --> 02:15:27,875
But only if their difference
in the scoreboard is maintained.

1492
02:15:29,916 --> 02:15:33,166
That's why the boys are just
hitting the ball around to kill the time.

1493
02:15:46,958 --> 02:15:48,250
The referee indicates a foul.

1494
02:15:48,333 --> 02:15:50,750
While tackling Jordan, player number five,

1495
02:15:51,041 --> 02:15:54,041
Singh made a mistake. A short corner
can prove to be dear to them.

1496
02:16:52,125 --> 02:16:53,916
And England scores another goal!

1497
02:16:54,625 --> 02:16:56,791
This short corner
proved to be dear to Punjab.

1498
02:16:56,875 --> 02:16:58,583
Yeah!

1499
02:16:59,083 --> 02:17:02,000
And England tied the score
by scoring this goal.

1500
02:17:03,416 --> 02:17:06,541
Yes! Yes!

1501
02:17:08,625 --> 02:17:09,958
It can be said that he's going crazy
with happiness.

1502
02:17:10,958 --> 02:17:13,833
Yes, he is bound to feel this way.

1503
02:17:14,666 --> 02:17:15,625
Yes!

1504
02:17:15,708 --> 02:17:18,458
If England hadn't scored this goal,
then they would have lost this match.

1505
02:17:20,791 --> 02:17:24,708
And we have heard that Coach Clayton
doesn't like losing.

1506
02:17:34,750 --> 02:17:37,791
England's team is surprised
by their coach's behavior.

1507
02:17:39,625 --> 02:17:40,583
England's players

1508
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,708
are taking Coach Clayton
out of the ground.

1509
02:17:51,125 --> 02:17:54,291
Okay now the winner of the match
will be decided through penalty shootout.

1510
02:17:54,375 --> 02:17:58,333
That means now both the teams
will have five penalty strokes each.

1511
02:17:58,416 --> 02:18:02,083
And that will decide who wins this match.

1512
02:18:02,166 --> 02:18:06,833
As per the new rules, the striker
will have eight seconds to score a goal.

1513
02:18:10,375 --> 02:18:11,791
Jordan will be the goalie for England.

1514
02:18:11,875 --> 02:18:14,208
And Punjab's Grewal is the striker.

1515
02:18:16,291 --> 02:18:17,625
Let's see whether or not

1516
02:18:18,041 --> 02:18:19,125
Grewal is successful

1517
02:18:19,208 --> 02:18:22,750
in helping his team score
the first penalty stroke.

1518
02:18:30,625 --> 02:18:32,958
There you go.
Punjab fails to score a goal.

1519
02:18:33,041 --> 02:18:34,708
Grewal missed his target.

1520
02:18:36,833 --> 02:18:38,916
Ruff from England's team
will now take the penalty stroke.

1521
02:18:39,250 --> 02:18:41,458
And the goalkeeper before him is Happy.

1522
02:18:56,583 --> 02:18:57,791
And a goal!

1523
02:18:58,291 --> 02:19:00,208
-Ruff has scored a beautiful goal.
-Yeah!

1524
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,541
At the moment,
England is leading Punjab, 4-3.

1525
02:19:05,541 --> 02:19:07,541
Punjab's next striker is Dodhi.

1526
02:19:07,625 --> 02:19:10,708
He has been in very good form
since the last match.

1527
02:19:11,208 --> 02:19:13,375
Jordan is very good at defending the goal.

1528
02:19:33,458 --> 02:19:34,666
Yes.

1529
02:19:36,708 --> 02:19:39,625
There you go,
an unbelievable goal by Dodhi.

1530
02:19:39,916 --> 02:19:42,166
Dodhi is signing to Coach Clayton.

1531
02:19:45,583 --> 02:19:47,875
One of the best players of England,
Hackon.

1532
02:19:47,958 --> 02:19:50,416
It is obvious that
Happy is under pressure.

1533
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:00,708
And a goal!

1534
02:20:00,791 --> 02:20:03,208
England succeeds in scoring a goal
from its second penalty stroke as well.

1535
02:20:03,291 --> 02:20:05,541
England once again is leading Punjab.

1536
02:20:05,625 --> 02:20:08,833
Now it's Punjab's turn to strike.

1537
02:20:08,916 --> 02:20:11,291
And the name of the player who is going
to take this penalty for Punjab

1538
02:20:11,375 --> 02:20:12,708
is Singh.

1539
02:20:34,791 --> 02:20:36,500
The next striker is Billbong.

1540
02:20:36,583 --> 02:20:39,625
Happy needs to stop this goal at any cost.

1541
02:20:40,333 --> 02:20:43,791
If Punjab doesn't stop this goal,
then they might lose.

1542
02:21:15,291 --> 02:21:17,083
And Punjab saved a goal!

1543
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:19,875
Punjab is still in the game.

1544
02:21:22,916 --> 02:21:25,041
Punjab's fourth striker is Amli.

1545
02:21:42,750 --> 02:21:46,416
There you go, another new move by Fateh.
Baba is walking onto the ground.

1546
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,666
Baba stares at Clayton.

1547
02:21:58,041 --> 02:21:59,833
Then moving on,

1548
02:22:00,041 --> 02:22:01,875
he greets the player

1549
02:22:01,958 --> 02:22:03,875
who...

1550
02:22:03,958 --> 02:22:05,458
...had hit him.

1551
02:22:07,791 --> 02:22:11,000
<i>You now have the reins to the country</i>

1552
02:22:12,166 --> 02:22:15,083
<i>You can either help it progress or ruin it</i>

1553
02:22:16,333 --> 02:22:18,750
<i>You now have the reins to the country</i>

1554
02:22:18,833 --> 02:22:20,875
<i>You can either help it progress or ruin it</i>

1555
02:22:21,333 --> 02:22:24,000
<i>Be one with the ground</i>

1556
02:22:24,166 --> 02:22:27,041
<i>Fill the stadium with power</i>

1557
02:22:33,125 --> 02:22:35,208
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1558
02:22:35,291 --> 02:22:37,583
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1559
02:22:38,125 --> 02:22:40,875
<i>Now hockey will score!</i>

1560
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,041
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1561
02:22:44,125 --> 02:22:46,833
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1562
02:22:46,916 --> 02:22:50,291
<i>It will reign some more!</i>

1563
02:22:50,708 --> 02:22:53,916
After this goal by Baba, both
the teams' scores are once again tied.

1564
02:22:54,416 --> 02:22:56,750
England's next striker is on the ground.

1565
02:23:14,291 --> 02:23:18,750
And Punjab's goalkeeper Happy
saves yet another goal.

1566
02:23:20,333 --> 02:23:23,791
Punjab's next striker
is the captain himself, Fateh.

1567
02:24:09,583 --> 02:24:12,791
Now the goalkeeper Happy
is facing his biggest challenge ever.

1568
02:24:19,458 --> 02:24:21,958
Yes, it is vital for Happy
to stop Jonathan.

1569
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,416
The score is once again tied.

1570
02:24:37,750 --> 02:24:40,083
Now this is a situation of sudden-death.

1571
02:24:40,583 --> 02:24:43,041
That thrilling aspect
in the game of hockey

1572
02:24:43,125 --> 02:24:44,166
wherein anything
and everything is possible.

1573
02:24:44,666 --> 02:24:46,750
Both the teams get one chance each.

1574
02:24:46,833 --> 02:24:49,541
The team that scores first wins.

1575
02:24:49,625 --> 02:24:53,541
The other team won't get another chance
to come back.

1576
02:24:55,583 --> 02:24:57,000
And the sudden-death begins.

1577
02:24:57,083 --> 02:25:00,125
The first player from England is Jonathan.

1578
02:25:00,208 --> 02:25:02,875
Let me remind everyone
that Jonathan is the same player

1579
02:25:02,958 --> 02:25:05,791
who has never missed a goal
in the past three matches.

1580
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,208
Are you ready?

1581
02:25:35,875 --> 02:25:38,291
Punjab is still in trouble.

1582
02:25:38,458 --> 02:25:40,833
Destiny is favoring Punjab this time.

1583
02:25:40,916 --> 02:25:42,416
They get another chance.

1584
02:25:54,041 --> 02:25:56,000
Listen to me... don't go for reverse.

1585
02:25:56,791 --> 02:25:58,708
You won't go for reverse, okay?

1586
02:26:02,666 --> 02:26:03,500
Dodhi,

1587
02:26:04,458 --> 02:26:05,833
don't you think that's too much pressure?

1588
02:26:05,916 --> 02:26:07,625
I'm too scared.

1589
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:29,333
There are a lot of expectations
from Captain Fateh Singh...

1590
02:26:29,416 --> 02:26:31,791
The whole stadium and all of Sansarpur
has expectations from him.

1591
02:26:31,875 --> 02:26:34,333
The whole team and us too.

1592
02:26:48,708 --> 02:26:50,208
Don't go for reverse, Fateh!

1593
02:28:19,333 --> 02:28:22,416
<i>You now have the reins to the country</i>

1594
02:28:23,791 --> 02:28:27,041
<i>You can either help it progress or ruin it</i>

1595
02:28:28,125 --> 02:28:30,250
<i>You now have the reins to the country</i>

1596
02:28:30,333 --> 02:28:32,875
<i>You can either help it progress or ruin it</i>

1597
02:28:32,958 --> 02:28:35,583
<i>Be one with the ground</i>

1598
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,375
<i>Fill the stadium with power</i>

1599
02:28:41,208 --> 02:28:43,458
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1600
02:28:43,541 --> 02:28:45,958
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1601
02:28:46,291 --> 02:28:49,333
<i>Now hockey will score!</i>

1602
02:28:50,083 --> 02:28:52,166
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1603
02:28:52,541 --> 02:28:54,833
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1604
02:28:55,291 --> 02:28:57,833
<i>It will reign some more!</i>

1605
02:28:58,791 --> 02:29:01,458
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1606
02:29:27,958 --> 02:29:29,916
<i>That day, Coach Harry saw Captain Fateh</i>

1607
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,166
<i>win a hockey tournament.</i>

1608
02:29:33,166 --> 02:29:35,250
<i>But that day a younger brother</i>
<i>saw his elder brother</i>

1609
02:29:36,041 --> 02:29:38,333
<i>win over something even more greater.</i>

1610
02:29:43,291 --> 02:29:47,541
<i>Let the blazing sun rise</i>

1611
02:29:47,958 --> 02:29:51,958
<i>Teach a lesson to those</i>
<i>Who don't know how to lose</i>

1612
02:29:52,041 --> 02:29:56,125
<i>Let the blazing sun rise</i>

1613
02:29:56,208 --> 02:30:00,791
<i>Teach a lesson to those</i>
<i>Who don't know how to lose</i>

1614
02:30:00,875 --> 02:30:03,000
<i>To those who know their limits</i>
<i>And to those who don't</i>

1615
02:30:03,083 --> 02:30:05,166
<i>Who's here to stay</i>
<i>And who's here to leave</i>

1616
02:30:05,250 --> 02:30:07,583
<i>The brave doesn't worry about such things</i>

1617
02:30:07,666 --> 02:30:09,750
<i>He only knows victory belongs to Lord</i>

1618
02:30:09,833 --> 02:30:11,916
<i>Blessed are those</i>

1619
02:30:12,916 --> 02:30:15,208
<i>Oh my dear country</i>

1620
02:30:15,458 --> 02:30:17,375
<i>Now hockey will score!</i>

1621
02:30:17,875 --> 02:30:21,458
<i>It will reign some more!</i>

1622
02:30:22,083 --> 02:30:24,833
<i>Now hockey will score!</i>

1623
02:30:25,041 --> 02:30:27,250
<i>It will reign some more!</i>
