1
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,166
'I was just a mere artist...

2
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,708
...I became an artist
and now a director...

3
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,708
...to all the directors out there...

4
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,333
...and the audience,
thank you very much.'

5
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,375
'Let your love and affection
for me always remain the same.'

6
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,708
'Your loving, Krishna Ajay Rao.'

7
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,875
'Krishna Leela, all the best.'

8
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:23,166
<i>"They are the children
born to Phonamma and Simmappa."</i>

9
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,291
<i>"Common Krishna Leela."</i>

10
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,500
<i>"They are the children
born to Phonamma and Simmappa."</i>

11
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,708
<i>"Common Krishna Leela."</i>

12
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,833
<i>"His life is in reverse gear."</i>

13
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,041
<i>"The entire journey, it breaks down."</i>

14
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:44,666
<i>"Their story is very chaotic."</i>

15
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:52,333
<i>"He is Krishna."</i>

16
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:59,666
<i>"She is Leela."</i>

17
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:09,125
<i>"There's loan and
love in their story."</i>

18
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:15,541
<i>"There's gap and goal in their game."</i>

19
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:21,875
<i>"There's speed and
break in their trip."</i>

20
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:28,291
<i>"There's hump and
hole in their route."</i>

21
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:34,666
<i>"The tapping sound is more
and beep sound is less."</i>

22
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,916
<i>"Their story is full kick."</i>

23
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,625
Pushpa, where's your brother Krishna?

24
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,208
The auspicious time is at 11 and
nothing is ready till now, it's 10.

25
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,791
Madam, where's Krishna?

26
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:12,666
He said he would get ghee to make
the sweet, but hasn't returned yet.

27
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,041
Oh no, Krishna is
not answering my phone.

28
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,041
The auspicious time is nearing.

29
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,625
The wedding hall hasn't been
decorated with flowers and plantains.

30
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,083
Welcome, groom's friends.

31
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,958
Uncle, where's our friend Gas Prakash?

32
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:26,957
He is in the room.

33
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,707
Mostly, he has gastric problem.

34
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:34,333
So, his friends have named
him as Gas Prakash.

35
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,250
Leave me.

36
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,750
Sister, mother told
you to get ready soon.

37
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,957
First go and get Krishna.

38
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,707
Tell her that I won't get ready
until he comes here.

39
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:49,416
Kumar, you've put up a tent house and
decorated this temple like a palace.

40
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,000
It is my childhood friend's
sister's wedding, I had to do this.

41
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,666
I've been trying since half an hour...

42
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,000
...but Madhu Naga Krishna
isn't answering my phone.

43
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,583
Madhu Naga? What does that mean?

44
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,166
The one who's getting
married is a groom.

45
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:01,791
Yes.

46
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,000
The one who's taken the responsibility
of the marriage is Madhu Naga.

47
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,125
Think of the devil and it appears.

48
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,250
Everyone in this temple
is chanting your name.

49
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,750
Where have you kept your phone?

50
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,458
Don't you see?
I am stuck in the luggage.

51
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,666
I don't know where the phone is.
Just pick this up.

52
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,125
Okay, get down.
Good you didn't get stuck anywhere.

53
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,500
That's better.

54
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,458
He has filled this
maruti van as a lorry.

55
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,500
Brother, you can relax later.
There's a problem inside.

56
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,041
- Come and solve it.
- Problem?

57
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,625
You said you know everything about
the guy. Is this you know about him?

58
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,625
Is it you who's marrying him or me?

59
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,125
You are waiting to
send me away, right?

60
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,208
Hey, don't talk rubbish.

61
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,457
I'll go and find out. Have patience.

62
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,083
No, I swear on this Goddess,
I don't suffer from gas trouble.

63
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,666
I was working in a gas
agency from past two years...

64
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,125
...since then my friends
call me as Gas Prakash.

65
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,000
If you want you can ask my friends.

66
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,166
Pushpa, tell your mom to get the chain
and watch that she's giving to the groom.

67
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,625
Okay, aunt.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,583
- Krishna...
- Mother, what's the matter?

69
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,625
I am not finding the chain
that I had bought for the groom.

70
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,166
It must be there, go and
search it properly.

71
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,500
I looked for it.

72
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,082
I didn't find it.
I am shivering with fear.

73
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,458
Okay, don't shiver and let
everyone know about it. Where's dad?

74
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,541
Why are you talking
about that useless man now?

75
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,500
Mother, tell me where he is.

76
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,291
He had bath in the morning and left...

77
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,916
...I don't know where he is.

78
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,875
Sir, keep this with
you and give me liquor.

79
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,291
It is 15 grams. If you give it to a thief,
even he will give you Rs. 15,000.

80
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,333
But I will give you only Rs. 35,000.

81
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,000
You are worse than the thieves.

82
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,583
Do you want booze or not?

83
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,333
I have taken the risk,
so I have to deal with it now.

84
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,957
Give it to me.

85
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,041
You say today is your
daughter's wedding...

86
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,500
...you have brought us to the bar.

87
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't understand anything, Narsimha.

88
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:28,166
Drink two pegs first,
then you'll understand everything.

89
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,833
Father! Father, let's go.

90
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,083
There's only half an hour
left for the auspicious time.

91
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:41,708
Hey!

92
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,125
- What do I do?
- What do you mean?

93
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,541
Bride's father should perform
the giving away ceremony.

94
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,582
Do you remember that I am your father?

95
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,583
I will not come. I will not.

96
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,041
Narsimha, whatever it is,
it is your daughter's wedding today.

97
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,625
Please, go.

98
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,500
Shut up!

99
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,041
I know how hard I've worked.

100
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,083
If I leave, then I am done for.

101
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,832
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for this day?

102
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,041
- Father, just come with me.
- Hey!

103
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,375
I will not hear a word more.

104
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:13,041
If I have to come there,
get my first daughter, third daughter...

105
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,958
...and my wife, alias your mother...

106
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,207
...tell them to come here.
Tell her to come!

107
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,957
Krishna, tell me.

108
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,625
I can't do anything now.
Just do as I say.

109
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,916
Okay.

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,541
Sir, the one who mortgaged
the chain here, I am his son.

111
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,791
Please tell me how much is the bill?

112
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,290
Rs. 5000 till now.

113
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:48,499
Sir, take this.
Please give back the chain.

114
00:08:48,582 --> 00:08:51,707
Look, he mortgaged the chain,
I can give only when he tells me to.

115
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,083
He had been insulting
us from so many years...

116
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,708
...even today he is doing the same.

117
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,500
Mother, you don't shout
and create a scene here.

118
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,125
Listen to me,
let this marriage get over.

119
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,500
My bad luck. Where is that man now?

120
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,625
Oh, welcome. Welcome.

121
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,915
Goddess has come to poor man's bar.

122
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:24,291
You've come with the entire
family to meet your husband.

123
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,375
What special?

124
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,833
Won't you stay quiet at least today?

125
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,666
Do you expect the bride
to come here looking for you?

126
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,000
That too such a place.

127
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:38,083
Dear wife, did you ask me
before you fixed this marriage?

128
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,541
Did you ask me before
you saw the alliance for her.

129
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:47,416
Mother and son happily went around the
village in the van and invited people...

130
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,708
...did you invite me?

131
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,750
- Did you call me?
- Father...

132
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,583
Hey!

133
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,708
Did your mother give
birth to you by devotion?

134
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,916
Did you call me?

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,541
Father, it is time for the wedding,
tell us what to do.

136
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,833
She has to ask that question to me.

137
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,708
Tell me what to do?

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,666
You all should fall on
my feet and apologize to me.

139
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:18,333
You have to respect me
as the head of the family.

140
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,040
- Forgive me.
- Forgive me.

141
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,000
Forgive me.

142
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,000
Forgive me.

143
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:52,000
Now... I will come to
your daughter's wedding now.

144
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,500
Okay, I will settle the bill.
Tell him to return the chain.

145
00:10:55,583 --> 00:11:01,040
Hey, I am not Yesu or Krishna to
forgive you when you fell on my feet.

146
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,708
You've cheated me, so as a punishment,
I have mortgaged the chain.

147
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,333
If you wish, pay me
Rs. 35,000 and take the chain.

148
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,166
- Aren't you ashamed...?
- Hey!

149
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,916
Don't talk too much. Do you want
me to perform the ceremony or not?

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,583
Wash his feet.

151
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,040
Okay.

152
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,500
Pour it.

153
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,875
Wash his feet.

154
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,750
Play the drums.

155
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,375
Hey, play the drums.

156
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,665
Hey, tell him to
pay us the money first.

157
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,500
Hey, bless them.

158
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,083
Give me the rice grains.

159
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,208
Don't put it on my head. Put it there.

160
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,833
You should make me proud.

161
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,458
Krishna, please take
care of mother and Pushpa.

162
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,333
- I shall leave.
- Okay, sister.

163
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,291
You don't worry, Krishna.

164
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,166
I will take care of your sister
like a queen. I shall leave.

165
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,833
Sister...

166
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,666
How much love?

167
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:38,040
Sister, the chain that I've put around
your husband's neck is duplicate.

168
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,166
He shouldn't know it for two months.

169
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,208
I will get an original one by then.

170
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,540
<i>"Love song, mass song,
patho song, duet song."</i>

171
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,625
<i>"Dirty song, hip-hop song,

rich people keep crying."</i>

but still smiles, he is special man."</i>

180
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,291

210
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,541
Hello, hello, mike testing.
Serial aunts and smart girls...

211
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,041
...and the thousands of hands...

212
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,750
...that are drawing instead
of holding touch screen mobiles.

213
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:01,000
The organizer of this drawing
competition today is, our favorite...

214
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,958
...the one who donate many saris...

215
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,125
...and donated 5 lakh books,
women's favorite...

216
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,958
...student's friend, son of our area,...

217
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,583
...Shriman Shrimati Shree
all in white and white, Mr. Sampat.

218
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:21,083
Please make him in the
upcoming corporation elections...

219
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,999
...and then as MLA and then
the chief minister of this state...

220
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,708
...this is my humble request to you.

221
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,082
Hey, Gopi!

222
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,290
- Boss.
- What is this?

223
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:30,624
Boss, it is build-up.

224
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,874
You may get a building
down instead of build-up.

225
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,083
There are so many festivals
organized in the area...

226
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:37,207
...where will I get money
for the token?

227
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,916
I don't have money in my account.
Just make me a corporator.

228
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,458
Boss, listen to what I say,
you'll surely become something.

229
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,041
I don't know what you do...

230
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,250
...you have to give the prize
to a very influential aunt.

231
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,500
Only then I'll get votes.

232
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,791
You don't worry, it is confirmed that
you'll become a corporator this time.

233
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,666
Thank god.

234
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,458
Take blessings from Lord Ganesha,
I will be back after taking rounds.

235
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,375
Listen to me,
put some serial sets over there...

236
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,958
What is this? He is telling
to give mobile to some aunt.

237
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,541
- What about your girlfriend then?
- You don't worry. Come along.

238
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,333
I have organized this drawing
competition just for my girlfriend Leela.

239
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:36,166
Nothing, just came to see if the
arrangements are okay. Is everything okay?

240
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,957
Instead of standing here, it will be
better if you stand somewhere there.

241
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,291
Hey, let's go.

242
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,333
Pal, your uncle is coming.

243
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,916
- Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings, uncle.

244
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,583
What are you doing here?

245
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,250
Uncle, there's a drawing
competition going on here.

246
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,041
Can you please take the other way?

247
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,375
Oh is it? Okay.

248
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,791
You should participate
in such cultural activities.

249
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,082
- Good. Very good.
- Thanks, uncle.

250
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,041
- All by your blessings, we are nothing.
- Very good. Very good.

251
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,625
Pal, did you see?
My uncle is a gentleman.

252
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,958
Useless guys!

253
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,875
They are doing function
by blocking the road. Function!

254
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,625
Scoundrels like them
should be shot at sight.

255
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,416
Idiots...

256
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,250
Wretched Baghi, come here.

257
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,458
Do you eat food or cow dung?

258
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,291
Even after so many years of marriage,
you haven't learnt to make a good coffee.

259
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:41,958
Wretched woman!

260
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,082
Mind your tongue first.

261
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,832
As soon as you come
home you start acting weird.

262
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,291
What's the use of telling you...

263
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,333
...the one who cheated me
and got you married to me...

264
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,958
...your filthy parents,
I should curse them.

265
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,832
How many times have I told you,
curse me as much as you want...

266
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,916
...but not my parents.

267
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,541
You! How dare you back answer me? You!

268
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,250
I will strangulate your neck.

269
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,000
Wretched woman!
Where's she? Other wretched woman!

270
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,125
Oh, drawing competition?

271
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,416
Do you know why they
organize such competitions?

272
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,916
Women bent down and draw...

273
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,541
...do you know what guys watch?

274
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,375
You are shouting so much on us...

275
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,833
...then why did you give donation money
when those guys came home asking for it?

276
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,000
That too Rs. 2000.
More than everyone did.

277
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,291
Wretched woman,
that was for my prestige.

278
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,333
So that those useless guys
shouldn't talk bad about me.

279
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,375
But you don't understand all this.

280
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,875
My mother forced me to marry you,
and you gave birth to this jinx.

281
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,750
You three have ruined my life.

282
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,833
Ladies and girls.

283
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,375
The winner of the
drawing competition is...

284
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:54,500
...daughter of our area's gentleman...

285
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:59,082
...Chiranjeevi Soubhagvati Kumari Leela.

286
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,041
We will distribute
the prizes in some time.

287
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,375
The winner,
Chiranjeevi Soubhagvati Kumari Leela...

288
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,500
...is requested to come on the stage.

289
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,958
- Go. I am telling you to go.
- Parlor Parimala.

290
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,041
The drawing competition winner,
Ms. Leela is here.

291
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,916
A big round of applauds for her.

292
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,083
Hey, clap.

293
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,000
Hey, stop it.

294
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,500
Hey Gopi, I told you to give
prize to any influential aunt...

295
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,125
...you are giving it to a school girl.

296
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,333
Brother, even if she's small,
she's highly influential.

297
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,207
Do you know how many
supporters she has?

298
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,041
I could know when
people clapped for her.

299
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,583
Congratulations!

300
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,082
Thanks, uncle.

301
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,625
Tell everyone in your
area to vote for me.

302
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,916
- Let's see.
- Let's see?

303
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,541
Leela, one minute.

304
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,875
I've put a sim inside the mobile.
It will get activated tomorrow. Okay?

305
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,332
Thanks.

306
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,791
Hi, good morning.

307
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,875
- Good morning, Khushi.
- Good morning.

308
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,625
Get in, son.

309
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,541
- Good morning, uncle.
- Good morning, Aarush.

310
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,750
Bye.

311
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,333
- Come on, get down everyone, okay?
- Bye!

312
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,375
Okay, okay. Careful. Okay, bye, bye.

313
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,083
- Get down. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

314
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,291
Why did you boys get ruined like this?

315
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,666
You are so active during the night.

316
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,750
You don't let us
and our phones to rest.

317
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,541
Never mind.

318
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,458
What? Saturday? Sorry, dear.

319
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,666
There's function in my
uncle's house on that day.

320
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,291
Let's go next week, okay?

321
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,457
Recharge just for Rs.500.

322
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:15,582
He, stop.
Let's continue tomorrow again.

323
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,500
Bye. These boys.

324
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,833
Tell me. What is it you wanted to say?

325
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,125
My new...

326
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,541
Look, I won't talk to you.

327
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,875
I'm very angry and
that's because of you.

328
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,041
Why didn't you call me last night?

329
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay. Now, stop flattering me.

330
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:37,791
Okay. I'm in the college right now.

331
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,000
Call me at night. Bye.

332
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,875
- Tell me.
- My new mobile!

333
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:47,291
Wow! When did you buy it?
You didn't tell me?

334
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,333
I was indeed waiting to tell you...

335
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,916
...but you are always
busy over the phone.

336
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,875
Sorry.

337
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,166
By the way, who bought you this phone?

338
00:23:56,791 --> 00:24:00,082
You should've seen the
faces of the ladies in my area.

339
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,791
You have already inserted SIM too.

340
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,500
It's again a guy who did it for me.
It's him again.

341
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,541
Tell me, Gopi.

342
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,916
Nothing. I called to find
out if the SIM has been activated.

343
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,457
Thanks for recognizing my voice.

344
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,083
Welcome. Bye.

345
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:24,333
He is so happy as
if I proposed to him.

346
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:27,625
Guys are so desperate for girls.

347
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,500
I'm so irritated talking
to just one guy...

348
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,916
...how do you talk to so many guys?

349
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,916
Hello, flower Leela,
only today you have grown up.

350
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,208
They say one gets lost
when mobile in hand...

351
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:43,166
...even you will experience the same.
Just wait.

352
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,666
Hey! Uncle!

353
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,166
Be careful!

354
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,875
What do you think you are doing?

355
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,833
- Hello.
- Hello, boss. I will come this evening.

356
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,291
It is a promise, boss. Boss.

357
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,541
- Sir!
- This is my bag. Give it back.

358
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,833
- Sir! Sir, what are you doing?
- Give it to me!

359
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,416
- Sir, wait a minute.
- Get away.

360
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,083
Sir, please give back the bags
to the kids.

361
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:27,666
Get in.

362
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,875
Sir, I will come this evening.
I have spoken to boss.

363
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:33,375
Hey, pay the money
and take back the van.

364
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:35,082
Sir, the kids are
getting late to school.

365
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,541
I will drop them to the school
and come. Please listen to me.

366
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:40,958
- Get away!
- Sir, please! Sir!

367
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,207
Uncle, our bags!

368
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,375
Yes, don't cry.
You will get your bags.

369
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,958
Let's stand aside.
Don't cry. Come aside.

370
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:52,000
Come. You will get your bags back.
I will bring them. Stand here.

371
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,332
Don't go anywhere, okay?

372
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:03,958
Yes, Krishna.

373
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,291
My van broke down.
I need a van urgently.

374
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,166
- Which area?
- I'm in Nandini Layout.

375
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,541
Okay, I will send it.

376
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,750
- Yes, Krishna.
- Buddy.

377
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:20,000
Take Rs.2000 and come
to Nandini Layout, 3rd cross.

378
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,208
Why? What happened?

379
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,041
I will tell you later. Come at once.

380
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:26,041
Kids, there's another van coming now.
You go to school in that.

381
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,541
I will bring your bags
before the school bell, okay?

382
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:42,541
Kids, come. Quick. Get in. Sit.

383
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,833
Go. Quick.

384
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,291
Buddy, what's the problem?

385
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,625
I will tell you on the way.
Go to Madigar Palya.

386
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,458
Give me the money. Go, I will come.

387
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,666
Greetings, boss.

388
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:48,082
Boss, I have brought the money.
Here you are.

389
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:51,708
Boss.

390
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,166
Boss, the school bags are in the van.

391
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,916
They will get late to school, boss.

392
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,291
Boss, I beg of you. If the kids don't
go to school, I will lose my job.

393
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,041
Boss, I'm getting late. Boss, please...

394
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,916
Hey, stop it!

395
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:22,416
Just 10 minutes late
and you are so worried...

396
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,083
...I gave you money
without any surety...

397
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,750
...how worried should I be?

398
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:30,458
Boss, forgive me. This won't happen
again. I will pay the money on time.

399
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:34,458
That's right.
Time, that's more important.

400
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:38,000
Not one day,
if you are late even by one hour...

401
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,583
...it will be bad for your health.

402
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,332
- Understand?
- Okay, boss.

403
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:42,166
Boss?

404
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,125
Take the money and give him the keys.

405
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,958
- Hey!
- The van has come!

406
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,875
That's my bag

407
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:58,458
- Bye, uncle!
- Wait a minute everybody!

408
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,500
Nobody will tell your parents
about what happened today, okay?

409
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,291
Why?

410
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:08,583
Because the van uncle will be changed.

411
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,707
Okay!

412
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,500
Oh, you guys are no less.

413
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:20,583
If there's a girl with you and if the
power goes off just for 10 minutes...

414
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,375
...you will do your job
before the power comes back.

415
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,000
I will call you back in two minutes.

416
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,458
- What, Leela Flower?
- Currency in my phone is over.

417
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:31,416
If I asked my father,
he will yell at me.

418
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,416
Will you please lend me Rs.200?

419
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,541
I will repay it later.

420
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,500
Why are you laughing?

421
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:41,500
I thought you will grow
up at least after owning a phone.

422
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,083
You are still in the
stage of playing games.

423
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,916
- What are you trying to say?
- You idiot.

424
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,375
Girls owning phones today...

425
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,500
...is like owning guys. Use them.

426
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,666
How?

427
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:58,708
Our beauty, our voice are our wealth.

428
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:01,875
Without allowing them
to be used the guys for free...

429
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,458
...you must make them pay for it.

430
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:07,625
You know, I have never spent even
a single penny on currency till today?

431
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:11,208
That's not all. Even this phone
I didn't buy it with my own money.

432
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,416
You have many friends.

433
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,625
I have nobody.

434
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:18,625
Hey, you think the guys
who call me are my friends?

435
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,541
- Then?
- Scapegoats.

436
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,666
You didn't understand?

437
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,458
90 percent of the guys who
call me have never even seen me.

438
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,582
Just phone contact. That's all.

439
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:33,457
Firstly, find some scapegoats
to recharge your phone.

440
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,625
How do I find them?

441
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,750
Not spoon feeding,
you need nipple feeding.

442
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,583
Look, give missed call to
four guys from your number...

443
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,125
...if you get return call...

444
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,333
...and if they turn out to be ladies say
'sorry, wrong number' and cut the call.

445
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:49,750
If gents, talk to them.

446
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,291
By talking to them you will find out...

447
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,625
...whether they are serious guys
or womanizers.

448
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,957
If they are serious guys
say 'sorry' and cut the call.

449
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:00,082
If they are womanizers,
try flirting with them.

450
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,500
That's all.

451
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:06,125
Okay. Give me four numbers.

452
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:08,375
Oh, my God.

453
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,000
Try four fluke numbers.

454
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:14,958
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

455
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:44,916
- Hello.
- Hello. Who is this?

456
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,041
Hello.

457
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,375
Sorry, sir. Wrong number.

458
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,832
Wrong number?

459
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:56,208
It was you who gave
missed call, right?

460
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,375
Yes, sir.

461
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,875
Then it is correct number.

462
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:04,875
No, it is wrong number.
I called you by mistake.

463
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,541
Why?

464
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,958
- Hello.
- Hello.

465
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,250
Oh. Sorry madam, wrong number.

466
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,000
If I answer it is wrong number...

467
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,666
...if my husband answers,
it is right number, you wretched girl.

468
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,750
You thought I'm unaware
of the drama you both are playing?

469
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,625
- Wrong...
- I won't spare you.

470
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,416
When will you get your
brother-in-law's chain released?

471
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,958
You know everything yourself, mother.

472
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:08,082
The money I earn I spend it
on household expenses and van loan.

473
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:10,625
Only if I earn extra money will
I be able to get the chain released.

474
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:13,125
I said I will work but you refused.

475
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,250
You have toiled for all these years.

476
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,708
I have consulted Venkatesh
brother for any trips.

477
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:22,082
Mangli, I'm hungry, give me food.

478
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,375
Touch my feet, I will give food.

479
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:28,833
I'm your husband, owner of the home,
you tell me to touch your feet?

480
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:32,750
May you go to hell. Though young,
he is taking so many responsibilities.

481
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,708
Never mind if you don't respect him.

482
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:36,207
You live on his earnings...

483
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:39,582
...and say you are the owner
of the house? Don't you feel ashamed?

484
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,708
Don't be proud because
you got your daughter married.

485
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,500
You have two more to get married off.

486
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:49,082
You too, stop having high expectations.
While fixing the next marriage...

487
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,291
...I will tell the
father has passed away.

488
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,041
Why are you talking in that manner,
mother? Give him food.

489
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,291
I shouldn't have had
a generous son like you.

490
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:01,208
You should've been the owner of a bar.

491
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,500
You only talk well.

492
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,166
- That's all he knows.
- Thank you.

493
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,000
Here, eat like a dog.

494
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:10,250
- Pushpa, come and have food!
- Coming, mother!

495
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,750
When we were newly married,
you used to call me God...

496
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,124
...but you,
you have started calling me dog.

497
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,041
I won't mind.

498
00:34:20,123 --> 00:34:22,373
I'm like a sunflower.

499
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:25,166
I keep changing based on time.

500
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:27,582
Like this, like this.

501
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:40,708
- Hello.
- I got a missed call from this number.

502
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,708
Who are you?
Are you calling from travels?

503
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:46,958
Travels? What is your name?

504
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,749
I'm Krishna, I'm a driver.

505
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:53,666
Oh. I wanted to call my
friend but called you instead.

506
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:56,165
Oh, wrong number? Never mind.

507
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,166
Hello.

508
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,750
You don't answer when I call
but answer when my husband calls.

509
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,833
- Aunt.
- I know you very well.

510
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,666
- Aunt, well--
- You wretched girl.

511
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,250
I won't spare you. I will kill you.

512
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,125
- You shameless girl.
- Oh, my God.

513
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,208
She switched off her phone.

514
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,250
- What have I done?
- You didn't do anything.

515
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,208
Did all this happen
without you doing anything?

516
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:30,125
- Good morning, Aarush.
- Get in.

517
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,750
Dear, we will surely
celebrate next year.

518
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,625
Don't cry in the school, okay?

519
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:42,250
Bye.

520
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,666
Aarush, you said today is
your birthday. Give us chocolate.

521
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,833
My father has gone to God
so no celebration this year.

522
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,625
To which God did your father go to?

523
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:58,625
Rohit, be quiet. Don't disturb him.

524
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:02,500
Vibha, your ideas
are not working for me.

525
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:04,208
Please lend me Rs.200.

526
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,958
Look, India losing in cricket...

527
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,583
...and girls losing in life...

528
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,375
...I can never tolerate both.

529
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,833
Come on, you can do it.

530
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,625
You said a guy called in the last.

531
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,958
Who is he?

532
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,958
His name is Krishna, a driver.

533
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,958
Don't open your eyes until
I ask you to, okay?

534
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:21,833
Okay, uncle.

535
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:24,125
Stand right here.
Don't open your eyes.

536
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,708
Happy birthday to you!

537
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:31,500
Happy birthday, Arush! Happy birthday!

538
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:33,291
Come, sit.

539
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:38,083
You were sad because your mother
didn't celebrate your birthday...

540
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:40,125
...so uncle bought cake for you.

541
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,958
- Thank you, uncle.
- Okay, dear.

542
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:45,333
This is Aarush birthday cake!

543
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:47,875
Take the knife.
Don't cut it until I ask you to.

544
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,958
I will shoot video. All of
you must sing the birthday song, okay?

545
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:53,208
Darn it. Ready?

546
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,500
1! 2! 3! Cut it!

547
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,708
- He didn't call back.
- Wait.

548
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,791
He will surely call back.
My guess can never be wrong.

549
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,333
Yes!

550
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:07,708
- Okay.
- Turn on the loud speaker.

551
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,875
- Hello.
- Who is this?

552
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:14,625
- Is it Krishna?
- Yes, it's Krishna.

553
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,500
I'm Priya.

554
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,333
Priya? Which Priya?

555
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,708
I gave you a missed call last night.

556
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,208
It's you. What's the matter?

557
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,958
Well... did I upset you? Sorry.

558
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,833
Sorry? Why?

559
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:36,916
For calling you instead
of calling my friend.

560
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,125
That's it? Never mind.

561
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,291
- Hello.
- Continue. Just talk.

562
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,833
Well, I was running short
of currency in my phone...

563
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:46,750
Yes.

564
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:50,208
So, I called her
to recharge my phone...

565
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,541
...and the call went to you by mistake.

566
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,708
I see. By the way,
did you meet your friend?

567
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:58,583
Oh, no. I've been trying...

568
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,791
...she isn't replying.

569
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,000
She must be busy.
She will call you later.

570
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,583
If you don't mind
can I ask you something?

571
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,458
Go on.

572
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:14,541
Will you please put currency for me?

573
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,083
As soon I get money...

574
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:18,833
- ...I will repay--
- Uncle, time up. Come.

575
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,000
He hung up.

576
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,625
He must be a serious guy.

577
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,708
He is not a womanizer.

578
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:33,291
You better delete his
number and try else's number.

579
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:34,958
Give me your phone.

580
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:38,416
I will set up four scapegoats for you.

581
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
And you maintain them.

582
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:45,041
- Hey, he is calling back.
- Really?

583
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:48,000
- Hello.
- Hello madam, sorry.

584
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:52,208
The kid who comes in my van,
it's his birthday today.

585
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,416
Hence I brought cake
and having him cut it.

586
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,416
- I'm sorry the call got disconnected.
- Never mind.

587
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,583
You made a kid happy. That's great.

588
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:03,708
I did as much as I could.

589
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,000
Then will you help me too?

590
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:10,041
- What help?
- I asked you to put currency.

591
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:11,875
Oh, I see.

592
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,750
Okay. I will put currency of Rs.100.

593
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,125
But you must put currency
for my number after you get money.

594
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,416
- Okay.
- Okay, I will hang up.

595
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,666
- He is trapped.
- Yes.

596
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,125
You won't find a better
scapegoat than him.

597
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,791
In case he puts currency for you,
don't let him go.

598
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,750
But he wants it back.

599
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:36,541
Girls' voice is like alcohol for guys.

600
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,791
Once they get addicted to it...

601
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,666
...they would never want to quit it.

602
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,333
What happened?
How come suddenly you are here?

603
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,333
They learnt the truth.

604
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:19,708
- Brother-in-law, how are you?
- I'm fine.

605
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,083
The auto drivers never have change.

606
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,041
I paid him Rs.1000 but
he says he doesn't have change.

607
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,708
Pay him Rs.100, Krishna.

608
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,666
Get water to drink.

609
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,666
Heavy traffic. I'm really tired.

610
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,250
You're auto driver,
you must have change.

611
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,125
You want change?

612
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:39,000
But you said you don't have change
to my brother-in-law for Rs.1000?

613
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,291
I will give him change
only if he pays me, right?

614
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,708
Here.

615
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,125
That's how brothers-in-law are.
Only incoming no outgoing.

616
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,666
- Meena.
- Yes?

617
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,458
Check if the mosquito net
is in good shape.

618
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,916
I can't tolerate even one mosquito.

619
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,666
Dear, that's Krishna's room.

620
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,500
Never mind, sister.
I will manage for one day.

621
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,458
So, you will bring the
original chain tomorrow itself?

622
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:08,875
So your brother-in-law
won't go until you get the chain?

623
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:13,166
Forget the chain,
I'm more concerned about the bedroom.

624
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,625
Brother, you can sleep here.

625
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:20,041
The mosquitoes are bored
sucking our blood every day.

626
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,541
Fatso, shut up.
Or else I will kill you.

627
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,541
Never mind, you will go to jail.

628
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:28,708
Tell me, Krishna.

629
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:32,333
Brother, I had asked for
any trip on Saturday and Sunday.

630
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,625
- I will let you know if there's any.
- It was a little urgent.

631
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:38,000
What can I do? It's off season.

632
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:40,708
Look, if there's any booking,
I will let you know first.

633
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:46,125
Buddy, will you play betting?

634
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,625
I'm against alcohol and gambling.

635
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:52,458
In that case, God save you.

636
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,083
He won't save you.

637
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:56,958
It is I who has to
protect Him every night.

638
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,708
If you want to offer prayers
then offer prayers to me.

639
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,750
I'll do something.

640
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:03,375
- I should offer prayers to you?
- I will kill you.

641
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,333
Did you hear what he said?
I will deal with you tomorrow.

642
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,000
- I will leave.
- Okay.

643
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,958
- Hello.
- Tell me, Priya.

644
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,500
I'm not Priya, I'm Leela.

645
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,500
But you said your
name was Priya that day?

646
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:23,583
I didn't know you that day.

647
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,833
- Is that so?
- Yes.

648
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,583
Well, as soon as I said hello,
you said Priya...

649
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,666
...how did you know it was me?

650
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:35,416
Well, I have saved your number.

651
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,041
Oh. Did you think I would call you?

652
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,208
- No.
- Then?

653
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,375
I thought you will
give me missed call.

654
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:46,750
- Are you mocking at me?
- Not at all.

655
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,458
I need to recover
the currency from you.

656
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:52,958
I see. In that case,
I will repay it tomorrow itself.

657
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:56,291
- How much will be the interest?
- I was just kidding.

658
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,916
Never mind if you don't
put currency but don't get upset.

659
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,166
I was kidding too.

660
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,916
Even you don't get upset.

661
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Very good.
You crack jokes very seriously.

662
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:09,083
You can't just laugh on the joke...

663
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:11,125
...you also need to
pay fees for the joke.

664
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:15,375
- Oh. How much?
- Rs.500 currency.

665
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,500
Are you serious or kidding?

666
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:22,375
Think about it. Take it as you want.

667
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:26,250
If it is Rs.500 then
it is a joke for me.

668
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,291
By the way, what's your nickname?

669
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:31,250
Is it Driver Krishna?

670
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,958
No, it is Smile Krishna.

671
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:37,458
Oh. That means you
keep smiling all the time.

672
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:40,875
Our life is like a circus
and we are like jokers.

673
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,541
Even if we fall down from above,
we continue to laugh.

674
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,333
By the way, what's your nickname?

675
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:48,666
Well, it's Flower Leela.

676
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,833
Flower Leela?
Why do people call you so?

677
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,333
Since I wear dresses
with flower design on them.

678
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:57,208
- Why?
- There are no colors in my life...

679
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:59,166
...so I want them
at least in my dresses.

680
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,458
- You're confusing me.
- Nothing as such.

681
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:06,458
Okay. My father is coming.
I will call you tomorrow.

682
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:09,041
- Okay.
- Sorry. I will give you missed call.

683
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:17,333
It's so hot. I will have
chilled bear and cool my body.

684
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,875
Sir, can I sit here?

685
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:25,916
Sit. It is not my father's property.
You may sit.

686
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,916
Thankfully he didn't recognize me.

687
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,208
Where did he go?

688
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:38,833
I think I have seen him before.

689
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,791
It takes so much effort to
keep this a secret for my in-laws.

690
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,416
Hello. I think I have seen you before.

691
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:53,833
I'm trying hard to recall.

692
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:56,083
Are you the corporator of our area?

693
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:57,875
- Yes.
- Narasimha!

694
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,375
He is your son-in-law.

695
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,750
- What...?
- Correct.

696
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,458
Sorry, son-in-law.

697
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,041
The alcohol is
adulterated these days...

698
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,541
...no drink works good.

699
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:16,083
Hence I couldn't recognize you.

700
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,541
Please don't mind.

701
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,750
- That's alright, father-in-law.
- No.

702
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:24,208
For once tell me you have forgiven me.

703
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,166
You are older than me, father-in-law.

704
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,250
Everyone is equal in liquor bars.

705
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:34,541
Hey! Rambo! Come here!

706
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,000
Take order from my son-in-law.

707
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:40,291
I don't drink hard drinks.
I only drink beer.

708
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:43,041
Beer. Chilled beer. Bring it.

709
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:47,583
- Well, what do you do?
- I do everything, father-in-law.

710
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,083
- You do everything?
- Yes.

711
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,458
- Tell me one of them.
- I will tell you after I find one.

712
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,416
So you are unemployed as of now.

713
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:56,666
Look here!

714
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:00,541
My son-in-law is unemployed like me!

715
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:06,291
- Sir, greetings.
- Are you here with the next installment?

716
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,125
Yes, sir.

717
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,958
The gold rate is
increasing day by day.

718
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:13,541
The same chain would've
cost Rs.60,000 now.

719
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:17,750
Sir, that's Rs.20,000.
I will pay Rs.15,000 next month.

720
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:22,750
Father-in-law,
you are my godfather hereafter.

721
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,833
But I have a small request.

722
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:29,791
Please don't tell
my wife that I drink.

723
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,333
Because I can't sleep without her.

724
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,791
- Krishna?
- Krishna!

725
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:41,708
I told you he will come here.

726
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:44,041
Come.

727
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:49,083
We three have come together today,
let's take a group photo.

728
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:52,458
Come on! Come!

729
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:57,333
Hey! Don't go! Stop I say!

730
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:13,250
- Leela, just a minute.
- What is it?

731
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,375
Nothing. I need to talk.

732
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,875
With whom?

733
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,750
- You.
- Go on.

734
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:23,458
Not here,
shall we go to coffee day and talk?

735
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,750
Find someone else for that.

736
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:38,708
What were you talking
with that brat on the street?

737
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:42,500
Not I father,
it was he who stopped me.

738
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:44,666
If the dogs on the
street bark at you...

739
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,208
...will you bark at them too?

740
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,416
I didn't talk to him.

741
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,291
I warned him not to talk to me again.

742
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,125
You say so.

743
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:56,708
Do you know what he says to people?
Do you know what people say?

744
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,375
All I have earned is respect.

745
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,541
I think I will lose even
that because of your behavior.

746
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,958
She says she didn't talk to him...

747
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,500
It is your fault in the first place.

748
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,208
Like mother like daughter.

749
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,666
I'm well-behaved,
you have lost your mind.

750
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,416
How dare you argue with me?
You wretched woman!

751
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,500
You argue with me? I will kill you!

752
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:20,416
Kill me! I will die!

753
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,125
- Die!
- At least then I will find peace!

754
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,916
You and your daughter
will tarnish my dignity!

755
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:45,000
- Tell me, Krishna.
- Sorry, only now I saw your missed call.

756
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,583
That's alright.

757
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:50,208
Why are you dull? What happened?

758
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:53,916
Nothing. Every family has problems.

759
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:56,041
Oh, problems of India.

760
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:57,791
Did your father scold you
or did your mother scold you?

761
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:00,000
It is only my father who scolds me.

762
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:03,208
But it is quite opposite in my family.

763
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:05,166
We scold my father.

764
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,083
Poor man. He must be a gentleman.

765
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,750
Not gentleman, he is a drinking man.

766
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:12,250
Oh, I see.

767
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,875
- Yes.
- Do you also drink?

768
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,416
My father drinks my share too...

769
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,541
...so I don't drink.
What about your father?

770
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,625
He doesn't drink.

771
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,958
But he is in rage all the time.

772
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,583
I see. Then do this.

773
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:28,791
One day, you drink and scold him.

774
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,208
Hello?

775
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,458
You are still on line. I thought
you've gone looking for liquor bar.

776
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:48,333
No, I was imagining how it would
be if I drank and yelled at my father.

777
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:51,791
What are girls famous for?

778
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:53,833
Why?

779
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,166
To see dreams for free.

780
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,500
Oh, is that so?
What are guys famous for?

781
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,666
To pay for their dreams.

782
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,333
You are so right.

783
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:07,625
By the way... Leela,
there's a function going on here.

784
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,458
- I will call you later.
- Okay.

785
00:50:14,541 --> 00:50:18,166
<i>"Morning, afternoon, evening, night."</i>

786
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:22,375
<i>"Engrossed in talks
after getting drunk."</i>

787
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,750
Full tight.

788
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:27,958
<i>"It's doubtful to even find time."</i>

789
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:32,875
<i>"It's doubtful to even find time."</i>

790
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,125
<i>"We can never understand their route."</i>

791
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,666
<i>"Morning, afternoon, evening, night.
Engrossed in talks after getting drunk."</i>

792
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:01,583
<i>"It's doubtful to even find time.
We can never understand their route."</i>

793
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:05,625
<i>"Talks are their food and
they share it amongst themselves."</i>

794
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:09,583
<i>"Sweet called talks fall
out by itself. They talk too much."</i>

795
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:15,500
<i>"Talk."</i>

796
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,458
<i>"Talk."</i>

797
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:23,416
<i>"Talk."</i>

798
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,416
<i>"Talk."</i>

799
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:03,041
<i>"With phone in hand,
their brain never works."</i>

800
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:07,041
<i>"They keep talking all day long.
If they don't talk, it's a crime."</i>

801
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:11,083
<i>"They never hang up the phone
though there's nothing to talk."</i>

802
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:15,041
<i>"They ask 'what?' in
spite of talking for hours."</i>

803
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:18,958
<i>"They don't care about
their parents or the world."</i>

804
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:22,875
<i>"There's phone in hand
and currency in the phone."</i>

805
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:26,875
<i>"Talk."</i>

806
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:30,875
<i>"Talk."</i>

807
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:34,833
<i>"Talk."</i>

808
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:39,166
<i>"Talk."</i>

809
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:45,166
<i>"People these days."</i>

810
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:52,041
<i>"They never stop talking."</i>

811
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,625
<i>They talk in the train,
they talk in the cinema theatre."</i>

812
00:52:56,166 --> 00:53:01,208
<i>"They talk in the bus,
they talk even in public toilet."</i>

813
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:15,458
<i>"Until they get sore throat,
until they go mad."</i>

814
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:19,500
<i>"Until the girl ditches,
until the guy betrays."</i>

815
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:23,458
<i>"Until the battery doesn't blast,
until the SIM doesn't get ruined."</i>

816
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:27,375
<i>"Until the network is lost,
until the tower collapses."</i>

817
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:31,375
<i>"No matter who gets ruined,
no matter what happens."</i>

818
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:35,291
<i>"Even if the phone rings every day,
even if life gets bent."</i>

819
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:39,333
<i>"Talk."</i>

820
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:43,250
<i>"Talk."</i>

821
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:47,208
<i>"Talk."</i>

822
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:51,208
<i>"Talk."</i>

823
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:55,166
<i>"Bad talks,
good talks, big talks, small talks."</i>

824
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,083
<i>"Household talks,
society talks, TV talks..."</i>

825
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,208
<i>"...radio talks, justice talks,
injustice talks."</i>

826
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:01,083
<i>"Innocent talks, rude talks,"</i>

827
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:04,625
<i>"Talks of brats,
Godly talks, talks of gossip.'</i>

828
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:07,875
<i>"Devil talks and all kinds of talks."</i>

829
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:09,708
<i>"Talks of the two."</i>

830
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:14,416
- Come, brother-in-law.
- Krishna, you are really fortunate.

831
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,416
Did the liquor price go down,
son-in-law?

832
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You think only about it all the time.

833
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:22,708
Brother-in-law, did the
groom's family refuse for dowry?

834
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:26,166
Krishna, the groom's family
is very impressed by you.

835
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,875
They are in all praises to you.

836
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:31,333
- I must say.
- Come to the point.

837
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,291
The groom has a sister.

838
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,250
She has studied 12th standard.

839
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:39,500
Since Krishna is a good guy though
he has studied only 10th standard...

840
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,125
...if he agrees...

841
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:44,000
...they said they will bear
the expenses for both the marriages.

842
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:47,666
Is the girl in good shape?

843
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,333
- Father--
- You say you're the head of the family.

844
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,041
But look at the manner
you are talking.

845
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:56,333
Let's examine the girl right away,
after marriage we can't do anything.

846
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:58,875
Father-in-law,
it is I who brought the alliance.

847
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:01,166
Your son-in-law, Smart Prakash.

848
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,708
I can never go wrong
in marriage alliance.

849
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:06,333
How much commission
are they paying you?

850
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,125
Father, brother-in-law is
doing things for our betterment.

851
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,541
Never mind, Krishna.
He is my father-in-law.

852
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,250
What is your decision?

853
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:18,333
The only happiness in my life...

854
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,916
...would be my marriage,
brother-in-law.

855
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:23,458
Even the happiness of
marriage won't last for long.

856
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,916
But people still cherish the
happiness for the rest of their lives.

857
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,083
So get me married to a good girl.

858
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,375
She is a good girl.

859
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,333
Now, you see her and decide.

860
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:36,000
I'll be glad even if
the girl is not so beautiful.

861
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:10,750
Did you really like me
or just because of this offer?

862
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,833
I liked the offer first.

863
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,625
But I liked you more than the offer.

864
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,958
But what about the mobile girl?

865
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:20,000
What about her?

866
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:23,125
She will come to the wedding,
bless us, give us a gift and leave.

867
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,291
What are you saying?

868
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:27,416
We thought you would take our
help in eloping, but you are marrying.

869
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:29,250
Are you sacrificing for your sister?

870
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:32,166
Hey loafer,
Leela and I are only friends.

871
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:35,458
Won't you sing duet songs
in Lal Baugh and Cubbon Park?

872
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:39,541
Shut up. Leela and I haven't
seen each other till now.

873
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:42,083
Did you waste so much money
on putting currency...

874
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:43,125
...to a girl whose face
you've not seen?

875
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,000
- It all got waste.
- Yes. - No.

876
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:48,000
Not that, pal.
She has helped me a lot.

877
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:51,375
My life was boring
paying loans and interest.

878
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:53,833
I get peace when I talk to her.

879
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:56,208
- I can't keep a price on it.
- Whatever it is, forget it.

880
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:58,625
We thought you were a lover boy.

881
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:01,833
We learnt that you are serious Gautam.

882
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:08,500
- Whose missed call is this? Looks new.
- It must be your would-be wife.

883
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:12,083
Hey, correct.
Very good. You guessed it right.

884
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,416
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Sindhu?

885
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:21,291
Why are you so formal with me?
Just call me Sindhu.

886
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,083
Oh, is it? Okay.

887
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:25,541
- Are you busy?
- No.

888
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,791
This is my number, save it.

889
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,666
- Okay.
- Is it okay if I give you a missed call?

890
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,125
No problem.

891
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:40,250
Sindhu, I'm getting an urgent call.
I will call you in five minutes.

892
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,000
Okay.

893
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:50,208
- Hi Krishna.
- You'll live long.

894
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,250
I was about to call you,
but you called.

895
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,208
Is it? What's the matter?

896
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:55,875
Good news.

897
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,833
- What is it?
- My wedding got fixed.

898
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:03,333
- Wedding?
- Why are you getting shocked?

899
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:07,125
Nothing, you suddenly told me.

900
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:09,250
Everything happened so suddenly.

901
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:11,833
So, I told you suddenly.

902
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:17,458
Congrats. Who's the girl? How is she?

903
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:20,416
- She is good for my range.

904
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,458
- When is the wedding?
- Next week is the engagement...

905
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,208
...they'll fix the wedding date then.

906
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:27,916
Krishna...

907
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,791
...I heard that guys
fear getting married.

908
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,666
You are opposite.

909
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:34,916
The guys who fear,
their story is different.

910
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I am not like that. I'm original.

911
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:40,041
Do I have an entry for
this original guy's wedding?

912
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,750
How can I forget you?
I'll give you the card first.

913
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:45,750
You have to come to the
wedding with a costly gift.

914
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,625
I'll exact the money I
spent on the currency this way.

915
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:51,125
Oh, is it? Okay then.

916
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,041
I will take out a print out
of the messages that you've sent me...

917
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,875
...and will put that in
the gift box with a letter...

918
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,375
...that you've cheated me in love.

919
00:58:58,750 --> 00:58:59,750
Hey!

920
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,958
Hello? Hello Leela!

921
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:09,208
Wretched girl!

922
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:22,166
'The Airtel number you are trying
to reach is currently not reachable.'

923
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:26,166
'The Airtel number you are trying
to reach is currently not reachable.'

924
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:29,625
'To leave a voice SMS,
just dial star followed by...'

925
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,958
I can hear the same song everywhere.

926
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,125
He is lying here like
an empty quarter bottle.

927
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:51,333
Why are you lying here like this?

928
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,291
Sir... my dear, sir.

929
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,875
What is your...

930
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,750
Why did you sleep in the
van instead of sleeping in the room?

931
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,583
Had you locked the door properly?

932
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,416
Take this.

933
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,125
Where is father?

934
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:29,625
I don't know where he is.
He didn't come home last night.

935
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,625
- Mother, I shall leave.
- Okay.

936
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:35,875
- I am taking the phone with me.
- Okay.

937
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:42,375
'The number you are
calling is not reachable.'

938
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,416
'Please call again later.'

939
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,416
If you have to take the old SIM...

940
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,208
...get me the documents
that you had provided earlier...

941
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:51,916
...then we'll give you duplicate SIM.

942
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:55,375
Somebody else had given that
SIM to me. Where will I find them now?

943
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:57,416
Why do you get worried?

944
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,833
Give new documents and buy a new SIM.

945
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:09,000
Be happy that old girl
and old SIM got lost.

946
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,208
You've bought this new phone,
talk to the new girl.

947
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:15,083
Not that pal, I at least
wanted to call her for the wedding.

948
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:18,375
Hey, like you lost your mobile,
even she would've lost it.

949
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:19,916
You'll find her some day, forget it.

950
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,333
Brother, it is okay if
you find her or don't find her.

951
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,458
You're getting a new wife...

952
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:25,750
...then why are you worrying about her?

953
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:27,708
- Hey fatso, I will thrash you.
- Somebody save me.

954
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:29,583
You are acting too much these days.
I have to cut that first.

955
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,041
Your phone is ringing. Talk to her.

956
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:36,208
Hey, it is not her,
it is my would-be wife's.

957
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:38,833
What do you want
other than a missed call?

958
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:39,958
You got it, now go and talk to her.

959
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,791
Talk to your would-be wife about
your future. Forget about the past.

960
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:05,875
Careful.

961
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:10,041
'I sent him the day before
yesterday by giving him chain.'

962
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:12,625
'Why did he come again?'
Brother-in-law, how are you?

963
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:13,333
Hi, Krishna.

964
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:15,833
Son-in-law,
you are carrying the suitcase?

965
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:19,208
Father-in-law, I can't take
the burden of your daughter anymore.

966
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,666
Very good.

967
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:25,416
You've done a great job.

968
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:28,291
- How are you?
- I am good, mother-in-law.

969
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:31,583
Auto driver is honking.
Do you have to collect change from him?

970
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,583
You should've informed us by phone.

971
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:41,708
You've come here with the suitcase.

972
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:44,666
I have to be alert as
I've taken the responsibility.

973
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:47,416
Look, from Krishna's engagement...

974
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,208
...to his wedding,
I have to run up and down.

975
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:50,666
If I am running up and down...

976
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,750
...then who will take care of
your to-be born grandson.

977
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:56,875
So I have come with the suitcase
to operate everything from here.

978
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:59,375
- Well said.
- Hey, give me a loin cloth.

979
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,291
It is there in the room.

980
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,208
Son-in-law, change your
name to Loin Cloth Prakash.

981
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:06,916
Father, stay quiet.

982
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,666
I said it because Loin Cloth Prakash
sounds better than Gas Prakash.

983
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,958
If you don't want, then forget it.
Hey, give me breakfast.

984
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,208
Krishna, you told me to get
a ring for the girl. Here it is.

985
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:22,375
- Is it nice?
- Yes. How much is it?

986
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,791
It must be Rs. 9000.

987
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:27,208
Father-in-law, you said it correctly.
How did you know?

988
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:30,125
Only gold knows the value of gold.

989
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,750
- Correct.
- Everyone knows what you are...

990
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:35,375
- ...here have breakfast.
- Hey, I'm becoming a grandfather.

991
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:36,833
Give respect.

992
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:41,291
Who is Krishna here?

993
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,708
- Some party is at the door.
- Sir, it is me.

994
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:45,958
- Okay.
- Who are you?

995
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:48,916
We've come from
J C Nagar police station...

996
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,125
...sir is calling you, come.

997
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:53,083
- Sir, what's the matter?
- You come, you'll know.

998
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,000
- I will go into the record room.
- Okay, go ahead.

999
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,125
Stop here.

1000
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,166
- Is someone inside?
- No one, you can go inside.

1001
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:17,375
Sir, I've brought the guy Krishna.

1002
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:19,333
Send him in.

1003
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,500
Come inside.

1004
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,625
Greetings, sir.

1005
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:31,583
- Are you driver Krishna?
- It is not me, sir.

1006
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:32,791
- It is him.
- It's me, sir.

1007
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:33,541
You?

1008
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:35,041
- I--
- My brother-in-law, sir.

1009
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:37,166
Greetings, sir.
What's the matter, sir?

1010
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,833
- Sit.
- Thank you. Krishna, sit.

1011
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:42,833
Sit.

1012
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:54,500
Do you know who she is?

1013
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,833
No, sir.

1014
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,750
- Do you really don't know?
- No, sir.

1015
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:06,458
You don't know her, but still talk
to her for hours on phone! You rascal!

1016
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:14,250
Sir, is this Leela's photograph?

1017
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:15,875
Oh, Leela.

1018
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:19,208
Do you remember her now? When I
asked you softly, you couldn't answer.

1019
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,625
Sir, it's not like that.

1020
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:24,083
- Sir, I am seeing her for the first time.
- Hey!

1021
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:27,458
Do you know how many
guys like you I have reformed?

1022
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:28,541
- Sir...
- Hey!

1023
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:31,583
- Call them.
- Okay, sir.

1024
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:34,000
Sir, what's the matter?

1025
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:35,625
You'll know.

1026
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:41,375
Please, come.

1027
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,500
He is Krishna.

1028
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:52,166
I beg of you.

1029
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:54,250
Tell me where my daughter is.

1030
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:56,000
I will not become
a hurdle in your love.

1031
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:58,500
- Hey Krishna, what is all this?
- Brother-in-law, you stay quiet.

1032
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:00,833
Madam, why are you talking about love?

1033
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,750
- There's nothing like that.
- Hey, don't do drama.

1034
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:04,041
Sir...

1035
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,333
I know what was
going on between you both.

1036
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,458
- Hey...
- Don't you feel ashamed?

1037
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:10,041
You always talk about love...

1038
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:12,041
...you have ruined my dignity.

1039
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:14,541
- Sir, I didn't do anything...
- Shut up, wretched woman!

1040
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:15,666
If you were right, this wouldn't
have happened.

1041
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,166
Hey, shut up!

1042
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,625
How dare you hit a woman!

1043
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,125
Rascal, I will thrash you
and put you behind the bars.

1044
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,583
- Get out! Get out!
- Hey, go out.

1045
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:25,541
Go out. Go.

1046
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:56,500
Look, if you tell me
correctly what happened...

1047
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:58,625
...it will be better for you.

1048
01:06:58,916 --> 01:07:01,875
If not, you'll be in trouble.

1049
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:05,166
Sir, I swear by my mother,
I am telling the truth.

1050
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:07,041
I just spoke to her on phone.

1051
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,916
Sir, I swear,
there was no love in between us.

1052
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,541
This is the first time I
am seeing her face...

1053
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,916
- Sir...
- You are telling stories.

1054
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,916
You wooed her in the phone...

1055
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,125
...kidnapped her...

1056
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,500
...and now you are making stories
that you don't know her.

1057
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:19,500
Sir, sir...

1058
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,000
Sir, how can you say that?

1059
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:23,583
Sir, I can swear by any God.

1060
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:24,708
Sir, it is not my mistake.

1061
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,458
No mistake? Then why did you
change your phone number?

1062
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:27,750
Sir, I lost my phone.

1063
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:30,291
They told me to get old documents
if I needed the same number again.

1064
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:32,333
I didn't have them,
so I changed the number.

1065
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:34,708
Didn't you call her after
you got your new number?

1066
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:37,375
I did, sir... but it was not reachable.

1067
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:40,375
- So, you don't know where she is?
- I swear, I don't know sir.

1068
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:42,833
Sir, what happened to Leela?

1069
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:45,166
To know that her father
has filed a complaint against you.

1070
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,833
Give me your phone.

1071
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:50,000
- Sir?
- Give it to me.

1072
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,166
This is a duplicate
SIM for your old number.

1073
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,958
We could know the truth
about you through this.

1074
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,833
What have you saved her name as?

1075
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:23,041
Sir, actually... it is Lee.

1076
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:27,166
Lee? Oh, code word.

1077
01:08:30,999 --> 01:08:32,957
Which is the other
code that says 'okay okay'?

1078
01:08:33,624 --> 01:08:35,624
Sir, it is the girl
I will be marrying.

1079
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:39,041
Oh my god.

1080
01:08:39,832 --> 01:08:41,499
He is very smart guy.

1081
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:44,415
He looks simple,
but has many secrets within him.

1082
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:47,291
Sir, his name is Krishna...

1083
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:48,582
...but he is like Lord Ram.

1084
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,208
So, he has made plans to go on exile.

1085
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,999
- Sir, it is not like that--
- I know how it is.

1086
01:08:53,499 --> 01:08:56,166
Sit outside. I will call
when you get call on this number.

1087
01:08:56,249 --> 01:08:58,541
- Sir, please listen to me...
- I told you I will call you!

1088
01:08:58,624 --> 01:09:00,666
Hey, come on. Go out. Go.

1089
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:06,624
They fall in love,
but we get in trouble.

1090
01:09:08,249 --> 01:09:10,457
Sir, what about that husband,
wife, and that guy?

1091
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,291
Hey, call them inside.
Let's talk. Call them.

1092
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:16,374
Come inside.

1093
01:09:20,249 --> 01:09:22,374
You should trust each
other as husband and wife.

1094
01:09:22,624 --> 01:09:24,832
Do you know what happens
if you suspect unnecessarily?

1095
01:09:25,124 --> 01:09:26,374
- What?
- Yes.

1096
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:29,707
Go.

1097
01:09:33,332 --> 01:09:34,790
Hey, you come inside.

1098
01:09:38,249 --> 01:09:41,582
Are you the one who gives
mobile to all the girls in your area?

1099
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:47,832
We gave you permission to install
Ganesha idol, but you do this?

1100
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:51,040
If you get caught in such case again,
I will throw you out of the area.

1101
01:09:51,332 --> 01:09:52,540
Be careful!

1102
01:09:53,249 --> 01:09:54,457
Go!

1103
01:09:56,249 --> 01:09:57,666
He looks like a fool.

1104
01:09:59,624 --> 01:10:01,082
Call him.

1105
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:16,208
Sir is calling you, come inside.

1106
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:24,666
- Sir...
- Sit.

1107
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:26,666
You've got a missed call.

1108
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,916
Dial that number, turn on
the loudspeaker and talk to them.

1109
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:31,416
Sit.

1110
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:45,625
Hello? Is it Krishna?

1111
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,915
Yes, Leela.

1112
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,750
Krishna, where are you?

1113
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,416
I am at home.

1114
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,958
Where are you?
I am at the PG with my friend.

1115
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,750
- Leela...
- Who is it?

1116
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,665
I am inspector Chandra Shekhar
from J C Nagar police station.

1117
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,791
Sir...

1118
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:04,541
Krishna is at the station.
Which PG are you in?

1119
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:06,915
I am in the PG at R T Nagar.

1120
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,750
Why sir? What happened to Krishna?

1121
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:10,416
If you come here immediately,
you'll know.

1122
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,083
Okay sir, I'll come right away.

1123
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:13,875
Okay.

1124
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:18,416
Sir, didn't I tell you?
I am not at fault.

1125
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:20,958
First let the girl come.

1126
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:35,250
- Leela...
- Mother...

1127
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,458
Where have you been? How are you?

1128
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:38,625
Where did you go without informing?

1129
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:40,833
Why are you talking to this
wretched girl who left the house?

1130
01:11:40,916 --> 01:11:42,416
You!

1131
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,666
Is this the way you
talk to your wife! Hey!

1132
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,833
That girl left the house
because of your torture.

1133
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:52,625
I will put you behind the bars
in the case of harassment. Rascal.

1134
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,458
Hey, call Krishna.

1135
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:19,625
Look Leela, your father lodged a complaint
that driver Krishna kidnapped you.

1136
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,791
So, I've called you here.

1137
01:12:23,833 --> 01:12:25,583
Your daughter is here, talk to her.

1138
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:29,541
Sir, what do I talk to her?

1139
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:33,790
The day she left the house,
she died for me.

1140
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:39,916
She? She was stubborn without
having food, so I lodged a complaint.

1141
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,250
I take back my complaint.

1142
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:48,000
She has seen her daughter...

1143
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:51,416
...she has ruined
my dignity in the area...

1144
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:53,915
...I will never take her
inside the house.

1145
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,625
Listen...

1146
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:58,000
If you want me, then come with me.

1147
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:00,666
If not, go with your daughter.

1148
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,166
- Listen, listen!
- Hey!

1149
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,875
Sir, you saw...

1150
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,665
...where do I go?

1151
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:11,790
Sir, it is enough
if my daughter is alive.

1152
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:14,958
- Sir, please get them both married.
- Hey?

1153
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:17,500
- Listen madam...
- Will you come or not?

1154
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:21,375
Hey, come here. Let's talk, come here.

1155
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:25,125
Sir, my daughter's future
lies in your hands now.

1156
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,415
You have to save her.

1157
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:27,540
- Hey, madam...
- Mother?

1158
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:31,166
Madam, one minute. Why are
you telling him to get us married?

1159
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:33,833
- Sir, what is this?
- It is your love story.

1160
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:36,250
- Sir, I am not in love with her.
- Did you hear him?

1161
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:38,958
Your parents give different
statement and he says like this.

1162
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,666
You tell me what should I do?

1163
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,083
- Sir, listen to me.
- Be quiet until she talks.

1164
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:44,833
- Sir...
- Shut up.

1165
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:47,458
Look, you are major so is he.

1166
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,625
If you say yes, I'll get you both married
as your mother suggested.

1167
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:52,208
Sir, you all are ruining my life.

1168
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:53,625
Sir, my life... my life.

1169
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:56,125
- Do you want to ruin her life?
- Not that sir...

1170
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:58,083
You fell in love with
her and now you want to escape.

1171
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:01,000
- Sir, please... listen to me.
- Sir, our Krishna doesn't lie.

1172
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:03,583
Sir, believe me.
Girls these days are not good.

1173
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,000
- Are you good?
- Sir?

1174
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:07,790
- Are you good?
- No, sir.

1175
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,041
Then why do you comment? Shut up.

1176
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,666
Sir, please listen to me.
I don't love her.

1177
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,000
- Let she say that. I will leave you.
- Sir.

1178
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,833
Leela, tell him that
we are not in love.

1179
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:18,500
Don't you love him?

1180
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:22,333
- Tell him that we are not in love.
- Don't fear anyone.

1181
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,666
Be courageous and tell me.
Just tell us the truth.

1182
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,000
Tell me.

1183
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,708
- I love him.
- Hey!

1184
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:37,291
- Hey!
- How dare you threaten her!

1185
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:38,666
Sir, listen to me. She is lying.

1186
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,541
Hey, how dare you raise your voice?
Shut up.

1187
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:42,625
- She is lying, sir.
- I will put you in jail in cheating case.

1188
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:44,040
- No sir, I swear...
- You are lying in front of me.

1189
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:46,416
Sir, I don't love her.
Please believe me.

1190
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:49,500
- Hey, call his parents here.
- Sir...

1191
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:52,125
Ramesh, go to Narsimha Swamy temple...

1192
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,540
...and tell them to organize
a wedding from the station.

1193
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:54,958
- Go with the team.
- Okay, sir.

1194
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:57,000
- Sir, I beg of you. I don't love her.
- Hey!

1195
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,790
- If you don't marry her, I'll kill you.
- Sir.

1196
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,416
Hey, keep him away from her.

1197
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,083
Hey, he is raising his voice.

1198
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:48,833
- Mr. Basavaraju.
- Sir?

1199
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:51,041
How many marriages
have we conducted so far?

1200
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,041
- Nine marriages, sir.
- Is it?

1201
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:55,333
Sir, you will earn good name by this.

1202
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:58,500
That doesn't really matter. I don't
want that girl's life to get ruined.

1203
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,040
You talk like a fool.

1204
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:01,541
Let's go and look into the matter.

1205
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,791
Here. Stop here.

1206
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:10,333
- Here. Quick.
- Now what?

1207
01:16:10,416 --> 01:16:11,791
Everyone believes her lie.

1208
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:14,375
How can they believe her?
We are not fools.

1209
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:17,125
Why are you standing quietly?
Why don't you oppose?

1210
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:19,125
For that we need to go to the court.

1211
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,250
Until then, Krishna will
have to be in the station.

1212
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:24,708
The marriage alliance I fixed
will be stalled after what happened.

1213
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:27,541
If we file a case in the court...

1214
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,541
...no guy will marry Pushpa
since she is his sister.

1215
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:32,415
- Check if everything is ready?
- Yes, sir.

1216
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:35,333
Sir, greetings.

1217
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,458
- Greetings.
- I'm Krishna's sister.

1218
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,916
She is our mother, sir.

1219
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,458
Isn't there an option
to call off this marriage?

1220
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:48,208
- There's an option.
- Tell us, we will do the needful, sir.

1221
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,375
Give that girl 50 lakhs rupees as
compensation...

1222
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:51,415
...I will call off the marriage.

1223
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:53,250
What are you saying, sir?

1224
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:56,916
If somebody had cheated on
your daughter, would you be quiet?

1225
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:59,916
Answer me. Go away.

1226
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:02,415
- Sir...
- I said go.

1227
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:13,333
Here, tie the nuptial chain.

1228
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:28,250
Sir, it's bad omen.
We need to wait for 5 minutes.

1229
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:31,708
Recite the chants,
people won't be able to hear you.

1230
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:35,291
Take it.
Tie the nuptial chain. Take it.

1231
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:47,083
Put it! Come on!

1232
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,540
Bless you both.

1233
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:01,583
Just a minute.

1234
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:03,916
This marriage was conducted by the
policemen. What do you have to say?

1235
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:07,125
Only because I spoke to her over the
phone, they forced me to marry her.

1236
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:11,125
I think the police will come up with a law
saying boys shouldn't even talk to girls.

1237
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:15,916
Narasimha, your son's wedding
is being telecasted on TV.

1238
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,875
- Son's marriage?
- Yes.

1239
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:21,375
My son has promised me
not to get married. Go away.

1240
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,708
Go and see on the TV.

1241
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,915
My elder daughter is pregnant.

1242
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,875
We have to bear the
expenses of her delivery.

1243
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:37,665
And we are yet to get
our younger daughter.

1244
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,750
My son is the only
bread winner in our family.

1245
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,665
Will he be able to
look after all of us alone?

1246
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:44,375
My husband is a drunkard.

1247
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,915
- He doesn't earn a single penny.
- You wretched woman.

1248
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:54,750
Hey! Mangli! Where are you?

1249
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:59,165
You put me to shame before the
entire state calling me a drunkard?

1250
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,250
You wretched woman!

1251
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:04,708
Our family got ruined but
you are concerned about prestige.

1252
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:09,750
On the day of my daughter's wedding
all of you pleaded me so much...

1253
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,875
...today, you betrayed me again?

1254
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,875
How dare you disrespect me?

1255
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:19,915
Father-in-law, this is not the
time to talk about it. Come with me.

1256
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,541
Sit. Be careful. Control yourself.

1257
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:30,375
Son-in-law, I learnt about
my son's wedding through the TV.

1258
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,040
Such a shame to me.

1259
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,083
- Father-in-law, actually--
- Don't give excuses.

1260
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:38,791
It was your duty to inform me!

1261
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:42,875
I'm the head of this family!
Owner of the home!

1262
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:45,583
Alright, what do you expect us to do?

1263
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:50,291
I'm hungry. Tell her to give me food.

1264
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:54,666
You wretched man.
Don't you feel ashamed yourself?

1265
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:59,333
We are upset that our son's
life got ruined but you...

1266
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,666
Here.

1267
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,458
Here, father-in-law.

1268
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:21,915
Why? Didn't you make millet ball?

1269
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:50,375
'I'm against alcohol and gambling.'

1270
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:53,000
'Don't be afraid. Tell me the truth.'

1271
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:55,040
'Tell him I don't love you.'

1272
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:57,000
- 'But I...
- Tell him!'

1273
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:59,958
- 'How dare you yell at her?
- Sir, let go!'

1274
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:03,166
- 'Sir, please listen to me.
- How dare you yell at her?'

1275
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:05,291
- 'It's a lie, sir!
- You will be in jail for life!'

1276
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:06,415
'Please believe me, sir!'

1277
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:08,375
'She is not my lover!
Believe me, sir!'

1278
01:21:11,416 --> 01:21:16,291
<i>"I'm punished for the
mistake I never committed."</i>

1279
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:21,375
<i>"There is no safety
for the lives of boys."</i>

1280
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:29,333
<i>"I'm punished for the
mistake I never committed."</i>

1281
01:21:29,416 --> 01:21:36,166
<i>"There is no safety for the lives
of boys. Ladies are first everywhere."</i>

1282
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:39,875
<i>"Whatever we do,
everything goes in vain."</i>

1283
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:43,540
<i>"Their talks are sweet."</i>

1284
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:47,333
<i>"If you get carried away,
you will be ruined."</i>

1285
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:51,000
<i>"Liquor is better than girl."</i>

1286
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,875
<i>"Is that how girls are?"</i>

1287
01:22:05,208 --> 01:22:12,290
<i>"Is this what happens to boys?"</i>

1288
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:29,625
<i>"Girls are silent killers."</i>

1289
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:33,000
<i>"They will ruin our lives."</i>

1290
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:40,166
<i>"We smoke cigarette in tension."</i>

1291
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:43,958
<i>"But girls burn our hearts."</i>

1292
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:51,375
<i>"They ruin the lives
of boys in jiffy."</i>

1293
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:58,208
<i>"Girls go wearing helmet."</i>

1294
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:02,625
<i>"Bottle is better than beauty."</i>

1295
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:16,875
<i>"Is that how girls are?"</i>

1296
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:23,916
<i>"Is this what happens to boys?"</i>

1297
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:55,875
<i>"There's full value for girls' tears."</i>

1298
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:59,541
<i>"The one who opposes will go to jail."</i>

1299
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:06,541
<i>"If there are insects in rice,
it can be cleaned."</i>

1300
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:10,166
<i>"What do we do if life gets ruined?"</i>

1301
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:17,583
<i>"Onion and tomato
prices have gone up."</i>

1302
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:24,666
<i>"But the value of boys
has dropped drastically."</i>

1303
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,416
<i>"Should we boys mourn all the time?"</i>

1304
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:43,041
<i>"Is that how girls are?"</i>

1305
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:50,166
<i>"Is this what happens to boys?"</i>

1306
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:57,291
<i>"Is that how girls are?"</i>

1307
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:04,750
<i>"Is this what happens to boys?"</i>

1308
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:47,416
- What is your name?
- Pushpa.

1309
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,666
- Are you studying?
- Yes.

1310
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,000
- First year Bcom.
- Okay.

1311
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:54,165
Go inside and get ready for college.

1312
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,708
- I will wash it.
- No, sister-in-law. That's alright.

1313
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:59,500
Give it to me.
You will be late to college.

1314
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:02,875
Wipe the front glass with paper.

1315
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:04,250
Okay.

1316
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:09,875
Have you become so lazy?

1317
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:11,958
- No brother, sister-in-law...
- Hey!

1318
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:16,291
If you address her sister-in-law,
I will kill you.

1319
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:17,916
What happened, Krishna?

1320
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:21,375
Everyone in the house
must do their own work.

1321
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:23,833
If you assign it to someone else...

1322
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:27,750
Why don't you just remain quiet?

1323
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,500
Look, he slapped her because of you.

1324
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:33,500
There is no peace in
our house after she came.

1325
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:34,625
I wonder what more is about to happen.

1326
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:38,165
Darn it. Why are you quarrelling...

1327
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:41,625
...at such early hour.
Why don't you let me sleep?

1328
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:43,833
You are not concerned
about your son's life.

1329
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:45,458
You are concerned about your sleep.

1330
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:48,166
His life is good
but if you keep quarrelling...

1331
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:51,250
...it is your life that will be ruined.

1332
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,708
What are you trying to say?

1333
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:56,125
She complained against him just
for talking to him over the phone...

1334
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:59,416
...if you don't leave her alone,
you will go to jail this time.

1335
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:11,333
I can now sleep in peace.

1336
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:22,500
Greetings, boss.

1337
01:27:23,083 --> 01:27:25,125
Why did you summon me?
What's the matter?

1338
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:28,708
Any trips? Give me the customers' phone
numbers, I will contact them myself.

1339
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:32,875
Total amount of money
you borrowed from me so far...

1340
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:36,290
...is Rs.6500.
When will you repay the money?

1341
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:42,375
Boss, what are you saying?
You are aware of my problems.

1342
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:45,750
- I won't flee.
- You won't flee.

1343
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,875
You've been spending
money on liquor these days.

1344
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:53,040
Look, I won't give you job hereafter.

1345
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:57,708
If you get drunk and ruin
my vehicle and my customers...

1346
01:27:57,791 --> 01:28:00,375
- ...I will be ruined.
- Please don't say that, boss.

1347
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:04,165
- I owe money to many people.
- So you have started drinking?

1348
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:09,833
Do you know why the responsibility
of your entire family is on you?

1349
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:12,250
Because your father drinks.

1350
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:16,333
If you also start drinking, there will be
no difference between you and your father.

1351
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,041
Mother!

1352
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:47,333
Pushpa!

1353
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:54,083
Where is everybody?

1354
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,291
Mother!

1355
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:04,083
Father! Father,
why did you lock the door?

1356
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:06,750
Father, open the door! Father!

1357
01:29:07,666 --> 01:29:09,125
Father, open the door!

1358
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:15,958
No matter who much you plead me,
I won't open the door until morning.

1359
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:18,791
Finish the consummation night today...

1360
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:23,666
...not just the door but the
entire world will be opened for you.

1361
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:26,708
Father, if you don't open the door,
I will break it.

1362
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:33,208
You fool. You need to
break the bed not the door.

1363
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:37,500
Show your manliness on your wife.

1364
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:43,416
- Father, open...
- Go. Go to the bedroom.

1365
01:29:55,541 --> 01:29:56,875
Tell me, Krishna.

1366
01:29:57,458 --> 01:30:00,083
- Hello, brother-in-law. Where are you?
- In my house.

1367
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:02,708
- Where are mother and Pushpa?
- Even they are here.

1368
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:05,333
Why did all of you go there?
Any function?

1369
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:07,708
Function not in my
house but in your house.

1370
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:13,415
Change your clothes and come,
I will serve food.

1371
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:41,375
Feast and consummation are for married
couples not for us. Take it away.

1372
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:45,666
- We are married too.
- It's not marriage, it's betrayal.

1373
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:51,666
Hey, did I ever tell you
that I love you over the phone?

1374
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:56,583
Otherwise did you tell
me that you love me? Answer me.

1375
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:58,958
No.

1376
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:02,916
I told you I was getting
married the next week, didn't I?

1377
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,583
Then why did you say like
that in the police station?

1378
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:14,415
Tell me. Why did you say like that?

1379
01:31:14,708 --> 01:31:16,500
They asked and I said so.

1380
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:21,500
Hey, do you understand what I am saying
or pretending to act like an insane?

1381
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:24,208
Not me you are behaving
like an insane.

1382
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,750
Hey!

1383
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:29,625
I was staying with my friend in PG...

1384
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:32,290
...after I got upset
because my father yelled at me.

1385
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:34,750
I tried hard to contact you.

1386
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:37,290
I had lost my phone,
what had happened to your phone?

1387
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,958
Why did you switch it off?

1388
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,583
I didn't switch it off,
my father took it away.

1389
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,125
Forget that. Why did you lie in the police
station that we both love each other?

1390
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:49,415
Because they thought we were in love.

1391
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,250
Don't talk like an insane again.

1392
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:56,250
You heard what my father said.

1393
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:59,000
How could I go back
to my father's house?

1394
01:31:59,083 --> 01:32:01,540
I rather commit suicide.

1395
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:06,333
The inspector said 'if you love him,
tell me, I will get you married to him.'

1396
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:09,333
And I agreed since
you were a good guy.

1397
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:15,541
I thought you were a good
girl but you are such a crook.

1398
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:20,125
You were only concerned about
your life and not about mine.

1399
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:22,083
What has happened to your life now?

1400
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:23,125
What happened?

1401
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:25,540
Had I married that girl my sister
marriage would've taken place too.

1402
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:28,500
I would've settled down in life.
Everything got ruined because of you.

1403
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:32,458
Because you lied,
people are taking me to be bad guy.

1404
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:37,125
It won't last for long. If we both
are happy, people will remain quiet.

1405
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:41,500
Is that so? You are so cunning.

1406
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:44,915
You thought only you are intelligent
because you go to college?

1407
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:48,458
Hey, I might've studied only
till 10th standard but I'm not a fool.

1408
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:51,833
- Let it be. Have food now.
- I said I don't want.

1409
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:54,500
Don't starve because
you are angry with me.

1410
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:57,250
At least have food.

1411
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,666
Hey, I will never get flattered.
You have betrayed me.

1412
01:33:32,958 --> 01:33:36,375
- Come, sir.
- I'm not here for haircut.

1413
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:39,833
- Lawyer Parameshwar had summoned me.
- Who are you?

1414
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:42,916
- Are you Driver Krishna?
- Yes sir, I'm Krishna.

1415
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,125
- Sit down.
- Sir...

1416
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:47,290
That's alright. It's my friend's shop.

1417
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:50,750
Are you wondering why all this makeup?

1418
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,875
Since we are seen
on TV a lot these days...

1419
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:54,415
...I want to look glamorous.

1420
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:59,665
On Sundays, I put my
body on work and not my brain.

1421
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,916
Travels Venkatesh said yours was an
urgent case hence I summoned you here.

1422
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:06,915
Don't worry.
I will make you like Lord Anjenaya.

1423
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:09,665
- Lord Anjenaya?
- You didn't understand?

1424
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:13,291
I mean I will get you divorced and turn
you to a bachelor like Lord Anjenaya.

1425
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,916
Venkatesh told me about you in short,
you tell me in detail.

1426
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:29,958
So they betrayed you.

1427
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:32,333
- No betrayed me, they ruined me, sir.
- Whatever.

1428
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,208
I can save from any problem.

1429
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:37,333
Well, did you have consummation night?

1430
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:40,290
Sir, was it mandatory?

1431
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:41,875
Do you want divorce or not?

1432
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:45,500
- I want and that's why I'm here to you.
- Then tell me the truth.

1433
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:49,083
My family thinks the
consummation night is over.

1434
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,166
But we didn't have consummation night.

1435
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:54,500
You silly. Driving school van you have
become like a school kid yourself.

1436
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,541
I feel you've been betrayed.

1437
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,875
So, it is my responsibility
to get you divorce.

1438
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:00,665
Thanks, sir.

1439
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:03,875
But the court asks
for reason and evidence...

1440
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:07,790
...and if I have to prepare them,
you must do what I say.

1441
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:11,790
Sir, I will do what you say,
I just want her out of the house.

1442
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:13,666
Not she, you leave the house first.

1443
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,291
- I?
- Yes.

1444
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,208
Though you're married
you didn't have consummation night...

1445
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:18,791
...and that's the valid point
in your case.

1446
01:35:18,875 --> 01:35:21,833
If you don't want to fall into trap,
you need to sleep elsewhere at nights.

1447
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:24,166
Sir, though I sleep at home,
I have control over myself.

1448
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,291
But what's the guarantee
that she will be under control?

1449
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:39,958
Pal, what is this? You are
giving shocking news one after other.

1450
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:44,333
Why are you getting shocked?
Shock is for her.

1451
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:47,958
She mess with me was her fist shock.

1452
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:51,083
I will make arrangements for everything
and send a divorce notice to her.

1453
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:52,541
That will be final shock.

1454
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:56,500
Pal, don't feel offended if I tell
this to you, whether right or wrong...

1455
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:57,915
...you've got married to her,
so you have to--

1456
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,791
What? Marriage?

1457
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:03,250
Hey, did you come for the wedding?
Fatso, did you come for the wedding?

1458
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:06,958
You call that as marriage?
It is blackmail.

1459
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:10,458
- For that you tell my wedding--
- Brother, sister-in-law is here.

1460
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:14,041
You! If you address her as sister-in-law,
I will kill you.

1461
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:15,416
Shut up!

1462
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:18,791
Krishna, come let's go home.

1463
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,166
Hey, tell her that I will sleep here.

1464
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,375
You told it to her, brother.

1465
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:29,500
Look, there can be many problems between
us, but it should be inside the house...

1466
01:36:29,791 --> 01:36:31,000
...you shouldn't get it on the road.

1467
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:34,500
Hey! You brought our life on road
and now you are lecturing me?

1468
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,083
Go home and sleep.

1469
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:40,666
Brother Kumar,
please tell your friend...

1470
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:43,500
Hey, no matter Kumar tells
me or Siddharammaiah tells me...

1471
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:47,540
- ...I will do as per my wish.
- Pal, please go home.

1472
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:50,791
Hey, you don't know about her.

1473
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,416
Her plan is to somehow
convince me to sleep with her...

1474
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,458
...and give birth to a child,
then she can stay peacefully.

1475
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:07,750
Pal, whatever it is, you shouldn't
talk like that. Go and convince her.

1476
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:10,083
She won't do any scene.
She is a drama queen.

1477
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:10,833
No, pal...

1478
01:37:10,916 --> 01:37:13,583
If you don't like me sleeping here,
tell me, I'll go somewhere else and sleep.

1479
01:37:13,666 --> 01:37:16,583
You are getting angry on me, pal.
Okay, sleep here.

1480
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:36,208
Stop! You are newly married. Where
were you instead of sleeping at home?

1481
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:38,040
To the graveyard.

1482
01:37:40,583 --> 01:37:44,083
Oh no, I think the horoscope
of this house is not good.

1483
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:47,833
Being the head of the family I don't
get a chance to sleep in the bedroom.

1484
01:37:55,958 --> 01:37:59,208
<i>"I am where you are."</i>

1485
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:02,791
<i>"My life belongs to you."</i>

1486
01:38:03,875 --> 01:38:06,208
Why? The song was good.

1487
01:38:06,541 --> 01:38:08,083
Why did you get inside the car?

1488
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:11,040
Drop children to school
and drop me to the college.

1489
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:13,375
Hey, do you think I am your driver?

1490
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:16,083
Husband is like a driver.

1491
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:20,083
- I will hit you on your head hardly.
- Okay, go ahead.

1492
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:26,540
Take this. Go in the bus.

1493
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:30,333
The college is just
5 kms from the school.

1494
01:38:30,416 --> 01:38:32,875
If I go in the bus,
it will cost me Rs. 50 daily.

1495
01:38:32,958 --> 01:38:36,165
It will be Rs. 1300 for a month.

1496
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:37,915
Is it okay?

1497
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,915
You've brought your wife along.

1498
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,541
- Theirs is a love marriage.
- Oh.

1499
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:50,458
Madam, even I'm going to the college.
He'll drop children and then drop me.

1500
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:53,290
Sister, what's your name?

1501
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:55,708
Leela Krishna.

1502
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:59,291
Sister, you are married.
Don't you have a child?

1503
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:01,165
Not yet, dear.

1504
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:03,875
Sister, when you give birth to a child,
admit her in our school.

1505
01:39:03,958 --> 01:39:05,333
We'll take care of her.

1506
01:39:06,291 --> 01:39:07,791
Okay, dear.

1507
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:29,125
Hey, take this. Get down. You
shouldn't come in my car hereafter.

1508
01:39:29,333 --> 01:39:30,375
Take a bus.

1509
01:39:30,791 --> 01:39:32,916
Look, don't be obstinate.

1510
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,416
- It will be better if you listen to me.
- oh.

1511
01:39:35,666 --> 01:39:37,916
My life has come to this
state talking to you on phone...

1512
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,166
...if I listen to you,
I will surely get ruined.

1513
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:43,166
I didn't know you would be so angry.

1514
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,625
I didn't know that
you were such a crook.

1515
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,583
You spoke to me like
that last night...

1516
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:56,875
...and now you are
talking to me like this.

1517
01:39:57,875 --> 01:40:00,541
You used to talk to
me so nicely on phone.

1518
01:40:02,416 --> 01:40:05,958
Your name is Leelavati,
but you act like Pandri Bai.

1519
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:08,833
Enough, wipe your tears now. Don't
create a scene on road unnecessarily.

1520
01:40:08,916 --> 01:40:11,541
I will drop you today one day,
but don't get into my car hereafter.

1521
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:15,040
Okay, I will go in
the bus from tomorrow.

1522
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,833
My college will get
over in six months.

1523
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:21,083
Then I will find a job
and repay all your money.

1524
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:24,165
- Until then you won't be here.
- What did you mean?

1525
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:29,250
What did you mean by that,
tell me, Krishna.

1526
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:30,833
Hey, don't irritate me. Sit quietly.

1527
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:52,875
Instead of going to honeymoon,
why did you come to the college?

1528
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:56,665
Mostly Krishna would've asked
her to give degree certificate.

1529
01:40:58,041 --> 01:40:59,291
Where is Vibha?

1530
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:03,000
Pal, stop.

1531
01:41:06,416 --> 01:41:10,625
Do you think guys as football
to play with them? Go and die.

1532
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:17,000
I deserved this punishment.

1533
01:41:18,458 --> 01:41:21,333
He put currency,
then took me for shopping...

1534
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:24,208
...he put money in the account.

1535
01:41:25,791 --> 01:41:29,250
After I took all that,
I had to take this too.

1536
01:41:30,916 --> 01:41:33,000
I learnt about your wedding.

1537
01:41:33,666 --> 01:41:35,333
Everything will be alright.

1538
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:40,333
Even I think the same.

1539
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:44,125
Mother, I am going to sleep.
I'll be back in the morning.

1540
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:46,500
Whose missed call is it at this hour?

1541
01:41:57,250 --> 01:42:00,041
This is my new number. Save it.

1542
01:42:01,375 --> 01:42:06,208
I took this mobile from my friend.
It is for safety as I roam outside.

1543
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:09,708
- I will not put currency.
- But you did before we got married.

1544
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:12,333
Hey, don't talk about past again.

1545
01:42:12,625 --> 01:42:16,041
Okay, you can add the currency
amount in my debit account.

1546
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,708
- What is it?
- Come and sleep in the house.

1547
01:42:24,875 --> 01:42:27,458
Hey, don't you understand
if I tell it once?

1548
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:31,958
Being a girl I trust you, but
being a guy can't you trust yourself?

1549
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:32,958
What?

1550
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:37,083
You are going out to sleep thinking,
I will do something to you.

1551
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:37,791
Hey, you...

1552
01:42:37,875 --> 01:42:39,875
Just sleeping together
we can't have children.

1553
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:42,040
If you trust yourself,
then come home and sleep.

1554
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:53,041
Does she think she's a beauty
queen that I'll get tempt seeing her?

1555
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:54,375
Short girl...

1556
01:42:55,416 --> 01:42:58,083
She is not grown up fully,
but she's challenging me.

1557
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:01,000
I will show her who I am.

1558
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:08,750
Brother-in-law, what is it?

1559
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:12,083
Krishna, you shouldn't get anybody's bed
sheet and pillow without asking them.

1560
01:43:12,291 --> 01:43:14,875
- Why?
- Because...

1561
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:16,958
It is because of this.

1562
01:43:17,625 --> 01:43:19,583
I don't need them now.

1563
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:22,625
I have kept the old stock
so that it will be useful in future.

1564
01:43:22,708 --> 01:43:23,958
You go to sleep.

1565
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:25,166
- One minute.
- What is it?

1566
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:27,000
Take this pillow with you.

1567
01:43:28,666 --> 01:43:30,916
Ask me if you want.

1568
01:43:32,375 --> 01:43:33,958
- Good night.
- Good night.

1569
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:37,333
I don't know what all
I have to see in life.

1570
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:50,416
'Did you feel bad?'

1571
01:43:57,916 --> 01:43:59,166
You!

1572
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:05,333
- Tell me.
- Just go to sleep!

1573
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:07,041
If I come inside, I will thrash you.

1574
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:09,041
If you have guts, then come inside.

1575
01:44:09,333 --> 01:44:10,708
Hey!

1576
01:44:19,041 --> 01:44:24,250
<i>"Leela calling Krishna, come, come."</i>

1577
01:44:25,666 --> 01:44:31,083
<i>"Leela waiting Krishna darling."</i>

1578
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:44,875
<i>"You sound is inside my heart."</i>

1579
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:48,208
<i>"I feel for you in my heart."</i>

1580
01:44:48,625 --> 01:44:54,833
<i>"There are thousands
of matinee shows in my eyes."</i>

1581
01:44:55,416 --> 01:45:02,083

of your dreams at night."</i>

1582
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,458

come, come."</i>

1583
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:14,291

1586
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:46,083
<i>"On the road of life...</i>

1587
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:49,375
<i>...there's is only your board."</i>

1588
01:45:49,458 --> 01:45:55,958
<i>"I will give you
a card with love daily."</i>

1589
01:45:56,041 --> 01:46:02,583
<i>"In the court of heart,
a case has been put on hold."</i>

1590
01:46:02,666 --> 01:46:09,125
<i>"Battery is getting over,
phase has changed."</i>

1591
01:46:09,208 --> 01:46:16,500
<i>"The camera of my eyes
are looking for your face only."</i>

1592
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:22,500
<i>"Leela calling Krishna darling,

1593
01:46:24,125 --> 01:46:29,166

1597
01:46:53,666 --> 01:46:56,875

1598
01:46:56,958 --> 01:46:59,708

01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:02,541

<i>"Krishna waiting Leela
darling come, come."</i>

1612
01:48:21,708 --> 01:48:24,375
Sir, that was the last wedding.
We didn't get anyone married after that.

1613
01:48:24,875 --> 01:48:26,666
Okay sir. Okay...

1614
01:48:29,875 --> 01:48:34,250
Madam, we got them married, now
do you expect me to get them together?

1615
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:36,875
Sir, he got married to her by force.

1616
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:40,125
Until they settle,
I want you to scare him.

1617
01:48:50,916 --> 01:48:54,083
Greetings sir, please come.
Have a seat.

1618
01:48:54,333 --> 01:48:56,750
- Come...
- Sir, you spoke nice on TV that day.

1619
01:48:57,083 --> 01:48:57,875
Sir, what will you have?

1620
01:48:57,958 --> 01:48:59,833
- Coffee or tea? Hey dear!
- Greetings.

1621
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:03,375
- Sir, who is this madam?
- Who are you?

1622
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:05,500
I am Leela's father-in-law.

1623
01:49:05,958 --> 01:49:07,875
Were you present
on the day of wedding?

1624
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,208
No sir, no one invited me.

1625
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:10,916
- What?
- Sir, no one called me.

1626
01:49:11,583 --> 01:49:13,500
- Sit.
- Thank you, sir.

1627
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:17,290
- Mother, how are you?
- How are you?

1628
01:49:18,166 --> 01:49:20,916
Did you feel like meeting
me after so many days?

1629
01:49:21,125 --> 01:49:23,541
You know about your dad, don't you?

1630
01:49:23,625 --> 01:49:26,416
So, I brought sir with me.

1631
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,958
- Leela, how are you?
- Sir, she is absolutely fine.

1632
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:31,208
Her mother-in-law and her
sister-in-law don't let her work.

1633
01:49:31,291 --> 01:49:34,250
She goes to college and studies
at home. That's all. Am I right?

1634
01:49:37,458 --> 01:49:39,000
Sir, you ask her.

1635
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:42,166
Hope you don't have any problem.

1636
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:45,208
No sir, everyone are good.

1637
01:49:45,291 --> 01:49:47,250
We got you married
so that you stay happy.

1638
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:48,915
We will be happy seeing you happy.

1639
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,541
Am I right? Your mother called me,
so I came with her.

1640
01:49:52,625 --> 01:49:56,375
That's all.
Madam, you met your daughter...

1641
01:49:56,458 --> 01:49:58,415
...if you wish to talk to her,
then go ahead. What say?

1642
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,458
Sir, let they talk.

1643
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:01,458
- I shall leave.
- Sir.

1644
01:50:02,041 --> 01:50:05,708
You've come home for the first time.
Have coffee and leave.

1645
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:07,333
- Yes sir, have coffee.
- What...

1646
01:50:07,416 --> 01:50:09,833
- My wife makes nice coffee.
- Okay.

1647
01:50:12,958 --> 01:50:15,290
Mother, you sit.

1648
01:50:19,875 --> 01:50:22,791
There are black beads,
nuptial chain, and toe rings in it.

1649
01:50:26,708 --> 01:50:29,375
Meena, get coffee for me.

1650
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:31,541
Sir, greetings.

1651
01:50:32,041 --> 01:50:33,750
- Give it to her.
- What are you doing here?

1652
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:35,540
My wife is pregnant.

1653
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:38,375
- Oh, so you are here to meet her?
- No, he stays here.

1654
01:50:38,916 --> 01:50:40,791
- Why? Don't you have a house?
- I have, sir.

1655
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:43,041
- Then?
- Sir, he doesn't have any work.

1656
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:52,000
Sir, give it to me.

1657
01:50:54,666 --> 01:50:55,500
Sir...

1658
01:50:55,583 --> 01:50:58,458
I need to talk to you.
Let's go out and talk.

1659
01:50:58,958 --> 01:51:01,665
Come... It is your wife
who's pregnant, right?

1660
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:02,833
Yes, sir.

1661
01:51:04,416 --> 01:51:06,250
Then what are you doing here?

1662
01:51:08,166 --> 01:51:10,333
There are newly married
couple in this house...

1663
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:13,000
...don't you know there's
only one room at home?

1664
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:15,625
You should leave
the house till evening.

1665
01:51:15,708 --> 01:51:17,875
You should come in the
morning to see your wife...

1666
01:51:17,958 --> 01:51:19,875
...and leave in the evening.

1667
01:51:20,125 --> 01:51:22,041
I will come on rounds here often.

1668
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:25,625
If I come to know that
you've put up a tent here...

1669
01:51:25,833 --> 01:51:29,250
...your wife won't deliver,
but you will.

1670
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:33,166
Understood? Go. Yes!

1671
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:41,458
Hello?

1672
01:52:00,208 --> 01:52:02,833
Oh no, Krishna, we missed a chance.

1673
01:52:02,916 --> 01:52:05,708
Inspector threatened you,
you should've recorded in camera.

1674
01:52:05,791 --> 01:52:08,000
Forget camera, it would've been enough
if you would've recorded in your mobile.

1675
01:52:08,083 --> 01:52:09,333
It would be of evidence to us.

1676
01:52:09,666 --> 01:52:11,916
Sir, I was not at home at that time.

1677
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,750
Oh correct.

1678
01:52:14,166 --> 01:52:17,375
Do this, install a CCTV
camera at home tomorrow itself.

1679
01:52:17,625 --> 01:52:20,291
Next time if he comes, it will get
recorded though you are not at home.

1680
01:52:23,250 --> 01:52:25,375
It will be difficult for you,
right? Look...

1681
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:29,500
If he is traveling in Metro,
we should go in Shatabdi.

1682
01:52:29,583 --> 01:52:32,750
I will keep the papers ready
about your case in the morning.

1683
01:52:32,833 --> 01:52:35,040
You just give me Rs. 10,000.

1684
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:38,000
- Rs. 10,000?
- Why are you getting shocked?

1685
01:52:38,083 --> 01:52:39,250
It is only Rs. 10,000.

1686
01:52:39,333 --> 01:52:41,625
Had you taken this case
to some other lawyer...

1687
01:52:41,708 --> 01:52:43,625
..they would've charged
Rs. 25,000 as advance.

1688
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,041
- I just took Rs. 1000 right?
- Yes, sir.

1689
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:49,458
This is the problem of
middle class people.

1690
01:52:49,541 --> 01:52:52,625
You think problem as very big
and a small solution.

1691
01:52:52,916 --> 01:52:55,333
You shouldn't take problems seriously.

1692
01:52:55,416 --> 01:52:57,625
You'll get Rs. 10,000 in two days.

1693
01:53:00,166 --> 01:53:02,375
Hey, what are you thinking?

1694
01:53:02,458 --> 01:53:04,333
Is this what I deserve
for my higher education?

1695
01:53:04,541 --> 01:53:06,208
Do you want me to
continue the case or not?

1696
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:09,875
Sir, no... you go ahead.
I will make some arrangements.

1697
01:53:09,958 --> 01:53:11,250
Sir, you have to separate me from her.

1698
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:15,458
Hey, you've come to Partition Parmeshwara.
Then partition is bound to happen.

1699
01:53:16,041 --> 01:53:17,791
Actually, in a divorce case...

1700
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:19,416
...you will have to give
compensation to your wife.

1701
01:53:19,458 --> 01:53:21,415
But I will prove yours
as a cheating case...

1702
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,041
...I will make sure you
don't have to give compensation.

1703
01:53:23,333 --> 01:53:26,040
Sir, if you do so,
I will offer prayers to your photo.

1704
01:53:26,125 --> 01:53:29,000
- But don't put garland to my photo.
- Come on, sir.

1705
01:53:29,208 --> 01:53:31,290
- And one more important thing.
- Tell me, sir.

1706
01:53:31,375 --> 01:53:33,541
Since she threatened
you by bringing the police...

1707
01:53:33,625 --> 01:53:36,375
- ...don't yell or beat her in grudge.
- Okay, sir.

1708
01:53:36,458 --> 01:53:39,540
You will be safe as
long as you are polite.

1709
01:53:48,625 --> 01:53:50,208
Tell me, Krishna.

1710
01:53:56,625 --> 01:53:59,166
- How many days will it take?
- Four days, mother.

1711
01:53:59,416 --> 01:54:00,666
I will be back by Monday morning.

1712
01:54:00,916 --> 01:54:02,500
Tomorrow is Diwali.

1713
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:04,833
Your wife will give you oil bath.

1714
01:54:05,791 --> 01:54:09,458
You think you are millionaire?
Shouldn't he go to work?

1715
01:54:09,541 --> 01:54:12,750
If you are not destined to be rich,
what can I do?

1716
01:54:12,833 --> 01:54:13,833
Live as you are.

1717
01:54:13,916 --> 01:54:18,041
Krishna, you are going out of town.
Give me Rs.200 for my expenses.

1718
01:54:18,416 --> 01:54:21,041
- Don't give him money, Krishna.
- I'm going out of town...

1719
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:23,583
...you will behave yourself
during night times.

1720
01:54:23,875 --> 01:54:25,583
Then give me more money.

1721
01:54:26,833 --> 01:54:28,790
Everyone here blackmail me.

1722
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:31,916
I will come home for dinner...

1723
01:54:32,166 --> 01:54:34,625
...make non-veg for me.

1724
01:54:34,708 --> 01:54:36,000
I wish to eat non-veg food.

1725
01:54:43,833 --> 01:54:46,125
- Wait a minute.
- What?

1726
01:54:46,208 --> 01:54:48,415
- Brother, give me Rs.200.
- Why?

1727
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:50,458
Not for me, for her.

1728
01:54:54,333 --> 01:54:56,165
Tell her to keep her
expenses under control.

1729
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:57,416
Okay, brother.

1730
01:54:58,208 --> 01:54:59,375
Here.

1731
01:55:01,208 --> 01:55:04,040
I will repay the money.

1732
01:55:32,541 --> 01:55:38,000
<i>"I will wait for you.'</i>

1733
01:55:38,083 --> 01:55:42,790
<i>"Will you turn around and see me?"</i>

1734
01:55:43,625 --> 01:55:49,125
<i>"How will I stay without you?"</i>

1735
01:55:49,208 --> 01:55:54,540
<i>"Will you tell me?"</i>

1736
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:00,583
<i>"My heart has starting
beating because of you."</i>

1737
01:56:00,666 --> 01:56:05,625
<i>"Turn around and see me once."</i>

1738
01:56:05,708 --> 01:56:11,125
<i>"I bow to you."</i>

1739
01:56:11,208 --> 01:56:16,540
<i>"I bow to you."</i>

1740
01:56:16,625 --> 01:56:22,083
<i>"I bow to you."</i>

1741
01:56:22,166 --> 01:56:27,708
<i>"I bow to you."</i>

1742
01:56:55,625 --> 01:57:01,166
<i>"Think of me once and that's enough."</i>

1743
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:06,333
<i>"Call me one and that's enough."</i>

1744
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:12,291
<i>"Why do you hurt and give me pain?"</i>

1745
01:57:12,375 --> 01:57:17,416
<i>"Why such a punishment for love."</i>

1746
01:57:17,791 --> 01:57:23,250
<i>"You are the king of my world now."</i>

1747
01:57:23,291 --> 01:57:28,333
<i>"Tell me what you want."</i>

1748
01:57:28,833 --> 01:57:33,833
<i>"Tell me what you want."</i>

1749
01:57:33,875 --> 01:57:39,333
<i>"I bow to you."</i>

1750
01:57:39,416 --> 01:57:44,875
<i>"I bow to you."</i>

1751
01:57:44,958 --> 01:57:50,500
<i>- "I bow to you.
- I'm waiting for you."</i>

1752
01:57:50,583 --> 01:57:56,915
<i>"Turn around and see me once."</i>

1753
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,750
- Did you just come, Krishna?
- Yes, mother.

1754
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:02,833
You seem very tired.

1755
01:58:02,916 --> 01:58:04,916
I haven't slept
properly for four days.

1756
01:58:05,416 --> 01:58:06,791
Please heat water,
I want to take a shower.

1757
01:58:06,875 --> 01:58:10,166
- I will bathe, have food and sleep.
- Okay.

1758
01:58:11,666 --> 01:58:15,833
<i>"Have you come to cheat on me?"</i>

1759
01:58:16,333 --> 01:58:19,708
- Where is Leela?
- She has gone to college.

1760
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:24,583
<i>"You laugh at me after betraying me."</i>

1761
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:27,083
What?

1762
01:58:28,125 --> 01:58:30,291
Gopaliah here.

1763
01:58:32,916 --> 01:58:34,416
Why is this phone with you?

1764
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:37,041
I have told you several times
to pay interest money on time...

1765
01:58:37,125 --> 01:58:38,583
...but you never do that.

1766
01:58:39,416 --> 01:58:42,541
I was trying your number
for the past two days.

1767
01:58:43,041 --> 01:58:45,375
Last time, I took away your vehicle...

1768
01:58:45,750 --> 01:58:48,083
...this time, I took away your wife.

1769
01:58:48,625 --> 01:58:52,166
Pay the money and take your wife back.

1770
01:59:49,958 --> 01:59:52,083
Krishna! Krishna!

1771
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:05,083
Krishna! Krishna! Krishna!

1772
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:09,540
Get him!

1773
02:01:29,125 --> 02:01:31,541
No! No, Krishna! Listen to me!

1774
02:01:33,666 --> 02:01:34,625
Krishna!

1775
02:01:37,708 --> 02:01:39,958
I was out of town...

1776
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:45,291
...hence I was not available.
How dare you kidnap her?

1777
02:01:45,958 --> 02:01:49,458
We may not have money but
don't think we lack courage.

1778
02:01:53,791 --> 02:01:55,291
For this money...

1779
02:01:55,375 --> 02:01:58,791
...I toiled without having
food or sleeping properly.

1780
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:03,416
I will toil hard and repay
your money in four months.

1781
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:06,166
Come!

1782
02:02:23,291 --> 02:02:26,625
Why did you come into my life?
You think I'm a hero?

1783
02:02:27,958 --> 02:02:30,790
I fought to save,
that's not the fight.

1784
02:02:31,208 --> 02:02:34,875
I have to toil hard to
repay the money in four months...

1785
02:02:34,958 --> 02:02:36,625
...that's the real fight.

1786
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:39,000
One needs money to survive.

1787
02:02:39,083 --> 02:02:40,958
Otherwise, nobody will care for us.

1788
02:02:41,416 --> 02:02:43,333
People will taunt you.

1789
02:02:55,250 --> 02:02:57,291
You tarnished my dignity!

1790
02:02:57,375 --> 02:02:59,333
You want my money, you wretched girl?

1791
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:02,500
Let bygones be bygones.

1792
02:03:02,791 --> 02:03:04,458
If not us, who will seek for help?

1793
02:03:04,541 --> 02:03:07,666
She should've thought about
it before leaving this house.

1794
02:03:07,916 --> 02:03:09,708
Even my father had never hit me.

1795
02:03:09,916 --> 02:03:13,833
Because of her, that inspector
put me to shame before everyone.

1796
02:03:14,291 --> 02:03:16,458
I will never help her.

1797
02:03:16,541 --> 02:03:18,333
If you don't send her out now...

1798
02:03:18,375 --> 02:03:20,708
...I will throw even
you out of the house.

1799
02:03:25,625 --> 02:03:26,958
Leela!

1800
02:03:45,791 --> 02:03:48,000
Why did you come again?

1801
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,958
I'm here to wish to good night.

1802
02:03:56,333 --> 02:03:58,040
Hey, have you lost your mind?

1803
02:03:58,125 --> 02:04:00,958
- You disrespect your father? Come in.
- Hey!

1804
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,541
Your husband has been overpowering us
since we fear him.

1805
02:04:11,583 --> 02:04:13,790
I'm not scared of him anymore.

1806
02:04:14,625 --> 02:04:19,750
If your husband is fire,
I'm fire engine.

1807
02:04:20,291 --> 02:04:21,958
I will slap you!

1808
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:25,583
Hey! You will slap me?

1809
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,583
I'm drunk now.

1810
02:04:29,666 --> 02:04:31,583
Come inside at once.

1811
02:04:31,666 --> 02:04:35,000
No! I won't come inside!

1812
02:04:35,625 --> 02:04:37,625
I will stand right here and speak.

1813
02:04:37,833 --> 02:04:40,250
Just two things.

1814
02:04:40,916 --> 02:04:45,291
Just two things.
One, it's about your husband...

1815
02:04:46,166 --> 02:04:49,583
...second, about my husband.

1816
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:58,458
Father, it is you who wanted
to become a big officer studying CA...

1817
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,000
...in the greed for your
father's government job...

1818
02:05:04,333 --> 02:05:07,790
...your mother suggested to
make you study till 12th standard.

1819
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:11,000
It was your mother again
who got you married...

1820
02:05:11,458 --> 02:05:16,165
...but you vent your
anger on me and my mother.

1821
02:05:16,750 --> 02:05:20,416
- Why?
- Leela, I beg of you. Come inside.

1822
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:22,666
- Please...
- Wait, mother.

1823
02:05:23,041 --> 02:05:27,291
I want to talk about just two things.

1824
02:05:27,666 --> 02:05:30,291
Only two matters.

1825
02:05:30,708 --> 02:05:34,875
- One, it's about your mother and...
- About my husband!

1826
02:05:36,083 --> 02:05:37,708
Correct!

1827
02:05:38,583 --> 02:05:40,040
All of you are here.

1828
02:05:40,750 --> 02:05:45,166
It was you people...

1829
02:05:46,416 --> 02:05:50,375
...who said I eloped with someone.

1830
02:05:51,583 --> 02:05:53,540
I will tell you the truth today.

1831
02:05:53,625 --> 02:05:54,666
Listen to me.

1832
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:57,083
I will sit down
and tell my father's story.

1833
02:05:57,458 --> 02:06:01,250
My father who speaks
politely to people...

1834
02:06:01,541 --> 02:06:04,333
...do you how rude he is at home?

1835
02:06:04,791 --> 02:06:07,875
He abuses us all the time.

1836
02:06:09,208 --> 02:06:11,165
Please be quiet.

1837
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:17,958
Hey Gopi, come here.

1838
02:06:18,458 --> 02:06:21,415
- Hey.
- Hey loafer, come here.

1839
02:06:24,583 --> 02:06:26,333
You tried so hard to woo me...

1840
02:06:26,416 --> 02:06:29,041
- Leela...
- ...did I fall for you?

1841
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:34,083
Many boys like him
tried hard to woo me...

1842
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:37,958
...but I didn't fall for anyone.

1843
02:06:38,375 --> 02:06:39,291
Super!

1844
02:06:39,375 --> 02:06:43,666
But my father complained
to the police...

1845
02:06:43,750 --> 02:06:48,250
...that I eloped with a
guy whom he had never even seen.

1846
02:06:49,208 --> 02:06:53,083
What do I do?
I got married to Krishna.

1847
02:06:54,416 --> 02:06:57,291
All of you must've watched on TV.

1848
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:05,041
Will you give even this to the media?

1849
02:07:06,333 --> 02:07:08,125
Go on.

1850
02:07:08,666 --> 02:07:10,875
It shouldn't be simple.

1851
02:07:11,625 --> 02:07:13,458
It should be entertaining.

1852
02:07:13,666 --> 02:07:15,416
I will make it entertaining.

1853
02:07:23,375 --> 02:07:26,500
"Loin cloth dance."

1854
02:07:26,583 --> 02:07:29,540
"Loin cloth dance."

1855
02:07:29,625 --> 02:07:32,708
"Loin cloth dance."

1856
02:07:32,791 --> 02:07:36,083
"Loin cloth dance."

1857
02:07:37,875 --> 02:07:40,541
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

1858
02:07:41,125 --> 02:07:45,750
You take so much pleasure
watching else's family problems.

1859
02:07:46,041 --> 02:07:47,291
What do we do then?

1860
02:07:50,833 --> 02:07:52,833
Bring me justice.

1861
02:07:53,541 --> 02:07:55,833
Bring me justice.

1862
02:07:57,166 --> 02:07:59,083
My husband is a poor man.

1863
02:07:59,875 --> 02:08:04,208
He is unable to repay the
loan of his elder sister's wedding.

1864
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:11,083
When I asked my father for money,
he threw me out of the house again.

1865
02:08:11,958 --> 02:08:13,875
Is it fair?

1866
02:08:14,083 --> 02:08:15,915
No!

1867
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,875
Had I married the guy
of my father's choice...

1868
02:08:19,958 --> 02:08:23,540
...he would've got me married by
giving 1 lakh rupees in dowry, right?

1869
02:08:24,750 --> 02:08:27,708
Tell him to do the same now.

1870
02:08:28,833 --> 02:08:31,500
Okay. Let's talk in the morning.
Go and sleep.

1871
02:08:31,583 --> 02:08:37,415
I'm talking now because
I can't talk in the morning.

1872
02:08:37,833 --> 02:08:40,540
Tell him to give me money.

1873
02:08:41,333 --> 02:08:46,833
I won't go until he gives me money.

1874
02:08:47,625 --> 02:08:51,250
I want money. Tell him.

1875
02:08:51,708 --> 02:08:54,583
- Ask him to give me money.
- Hey, come inside.

1876
02:08:54,625 --> 02:08:57,541
- She is in...
- If you don't come, I will throw you out.

1877
02:09:16,541 --> 02:09:19,958
Bring me justice.

1878
02:09:20,875 --> 02:09:25,416
Bring me justice.
My husband is a poor man.

1879
02:09:28,708 --> 02:09:30,250
Bring me justice.

1880
02:09:40,333 --> 02:09:44,583
Do you know who is responsible
for her to consume liquor and dance?

1881
02:09:44,666 --> 02:09:47,041
Her husband Smile Krishna.

1882
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,125
He said he had never
fallen in love with her...

1883
02:09:54,208 --> 02:09:58,915
...but look, he sent his wife back
to her maternal house to bring money.

1884
02:10:03,875 --> 02:10:05,000
Here.

1885
02:10:06,166 --> 02:10:08,791
You tarnished our
dignity getting drunk.

1886
02:10:08,875 --> 02:10:10,833
When did my son demand for dowry?

1887
02:10:10,916 --> 02:10:13,000
When did I say so?

1888
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:15,500
Stop pretending now.

1889
02:10:15,708 --> 02:10:17,665
What you did last night
is being telecasted on TV.

1890
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:19,333
Telecasted on TV? Oh, no.

1891
02:10:22,541 --> 02:10:25,125
- Leave me!
- Stop it, Krishna!

1892
02:10:25,166 --> 02:10:28,916
- Stop it, Krishna!
- Leave me!

1893
02:10:29,208 --> 02:10:32,750
Go and complain to whomever you want.

1894
02:10:32,833 --> 02:10:36,290
Even if my family is put to gallows,
I will never allow you inside my house.

1895
02:10:36,375 --> 02:10:40,291
- Leave me! Get out of my sight!
- Krishna!

1896
02:10:40,333 --> 02:10:43,958
I will kill you! Go away from here!

1897
02:10:44,333 --> 02:10:47,915
Go away from here! Go away from here!

1898
02:10:52,708 --> 02:10:55,375
- Krishna, control yourself.
- For how long?

1899
02:10:56,625 --> 02:10:58,625
For how long will I control myself,
brother-in-law?

1900
02:11:00,083 --> 02:11:01,625
I'm a human being too.

1901
02:11:02,375 --> 02:11:05,333
I've been constantly harassed.
How will I control myself?

1902
02:11:06,791 --> 02:11:08,458
What wrong have I done?

1903
02:11:08,791 --> 02:11:10,291
What wrong have I done,
brother-in-law?

1904
02:11:39,250 --> 02:11:41,333
It is good that you
immediately came to me.

1905
02:11:41,416 --> 02:11:43,000
I will apply for
anticipatory bail right away.

1906
02:11:43,083 --> 02:11:45,540
Police can't do anything
to you and your family.

1907
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:48,041
Sir, I don't care if anything happens
to me, but my family should be safe.

1908
02:11:48,125 --> 02:11:50,166
If you are safe,
then even they'll be safe.

1909
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:52,458
You were thinking all these days
that you don't have strong evidence...

1910
02:11:52,541 --> 02:11:53,416
...but now you've got it.

1911
02:11:53,458 --> 02:11:55,415
We'll show the video of her
creating chaos after getting drunk...

1912
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:57,250
...I will make this
case turn in your favor.

1913
02:11:57,875 --> 02:11:58,625
Okay, sir.

1914
02:12:28,833 --> 02:12:30,915
Krishna, why are you sleeping here?

1915
02:12:31,125 --> 02:12:32,458
I sleep here daily, don't I?

1916
02:12:32,541 --> 02:12:34,291
She is not at home now.

1917
02:14:16,541 --> 02:14:17,083
Hello?

1918
02:14:17,166 --> 02:14:20,291
Krishna, I am inspector
Chandra Shekhar speaking.

1919
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,458
Where are you?

1920
02:14:22,750 --> 02:14:25,750
Sir, I am on duty.

1921
02:14:26,208 --> 02:14:28,165
Okay, come to the station urgently.

1922
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,500
- Why sir?
- Just come to the station, that's it!

1923
02:14:32,833 --> 02:14:33,833
Okay, sir.

1924
02:14:39,916 --> 02:14:42,875
This is a sensitive case.
A non-bailable warrant will be issued...

1925
02:14:42,958 --> 02:14:44,415
...you'll be in danger
if you go to the station now.

1926
02:14:44,666 --> 02:14:46,916
Do this, if you get a call again...

1927
02:14:47,166 --> 02:14:48,791
...tell them that you'll come
after finishing your duty.

1928
02:14:48,875 --> 02:14:50,166
I will take a bail till then.

1929
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:52,541
- We both will go together.
- Okay, sir.

1930
02:15:01,166 --> 02:15:02,333
Yes, what is it?

1931
02:15:02,666 --> 02:15:04,791
My client Krishna was
summoned by the inspector.

1932
02:15:04,875 --> 02:15:06,708
Have a seat, I'll be back.

1933
02:15:10,916 --> 02:15:13,125
Krishna, he is calling you inside.

1934
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:20,500
Sir, greetings.

1935
02:15:20,583 --> 02:15:22,415
I told you to come soon,
you've come so late.

1936
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:23,958
You brought a lawyer with you.

1937
02:15:24,041 --> 02:15:25,791
- What is it?
- Sir, I finished duty...

1938
02:15:26,166 --> 02:15:29,083
Krishna, I've kept my jewelry in it.

1939
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:31,708
Sell them and repay your loan.

1940
02:15:31,791 --> 02:15:33,916
But don't trouble
my daughter for money.

1941
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,125
Madam, what are you saying?

1942
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:38,416
I didn't send your
daughter to get money.

1943
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,208
She herself went there
and created a scene.

1944
02:15:40,416 --> 02:15:42,541
Sir, that day you didn't believe me.

1945
02:15:42,625 --> 02:15:43,791
Please, at least believe me today.

1946
02:15:43,875 --> 02:15:45,833
I swear by my mother,
I didn't do any such thing.

1947
02:15:45,916 --> 02:15:47,416
Then why did you get lawyer with you?

1948
02:15:50,083 --> 02:15:51,333
Speak up.

1949
02:15:51,416 --> 02:15:55,416
Sir, I saw on TV that she got
drunk and created a scene...

1950
02:15:55,916 --> 02:15:58,416
...I hit her in anger.

1951
02:15:59,625 --> 02:16:01,500
You stay quiet, madam. You stay quiet.

1952
02:16:02,041 --> 02:16:03,583
Hey, where's your wife now?

1953
02:16:03,875 --> 02:16:07,125
Sir? Didn't she come to your house?

1954
02:16:07,583 --> 02:16:09,415
- Sir?
- Hey!

1955
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:12,333
Hey, why will she go to that house
where she has been shunned by her father?

1956
02:16:12,416 --> 02:16:13,291
- Rascal...
- Sir...

1957
02:16:13,666 --> 02:16:15,500
I beg of you.

1958
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:19,916
Tell me where my daughter is.
I don't have anyone other than her.

1959
02:16:20,125 --> 02:16:22,041
I have left my husband for her.

1960
02:16:22,125 --> 02:16:23,958
Madam, I swear,
I don't know where she is.

1961
02:16:24,041 --> 02:16:24,458
Sir...

1962
02:16:24,541 --> 02:16:28,375
I got you married to stay together,
but you are doing all unnecessary things.

1963
02:16:28,750 --> 02:16:30,833
Because of you, we are in trouble.

1964
02:16:30,916 --> 02:16:33,208
- Sir, actually...
- Let's look for her first. Let's go.

1965
02:16:33,583 --> 02:16:35,290
- Hey, Ranganath.
- Sir?

1966
02:16:35,375 --> 02:16:37,416
- Call the control room...
- Hello inspector...

1967
02:16:37,916 --> 02:16:39,833
I am Krishna's lawyer.
My name is Parmeshwar.

1968
02:16:42,125 --> 02:16:43,458
Sit for five minutes.

1969
02:16:44,083 --> 02:16:48,208
Sir, I attended the case of Muni Reddy
Palya riots and have filed a FIR.

1970
02:16:48,541 --> 02:16:51,791
Leela came in the morning and
told me to give this letter to you.

1971
02:16:51,875 --> 02:16:54,791
You had not come to the station.
So, I forgot to give you.

1972
02:16:54,875 --> 02:16:56,458
- Sorry sir...
- What have you done...

1973
02:17:11,249 --> 02:17:13,749
Sir, what has she written?

1974
02:17:15,790 --> 02:17:16,957
Sir, tell me.

1975
02:17:21,790 --> 02:17:23,457
Take this. Read it out.

1976
02:17:24,915 --> 02:17:29,707
Inspector sir, thank you for giving
me a life as taking part of a father.

1977
02:17:30,290 --> 02:17:31,457
If I am born in the next birth...

1978
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:33,415
...I will be born as your daughter
and repay your favor.

1979
02:17:33,624 --> 02:17:35,040
My intentions of writing
this letter is...

1980
02:17:35,333 --> 02:17:38,541
...I am responsible for
whatever happened in my life.

1981
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:41,957
Krishna or his family
is not to be blamed.

1982
02:17:42,165 --> 02:17:44,749
No matter what happens to
me or anybody files a complaint...

1983
02:17:44,958 --> 02:17:48,249
...please don't harass
them in any way.

1984
02:17:48,458 --> 02:17:50,666
Tell my mother to forgive me.

1985
02:17:50,999 --> 02:17:54,665
Krishna who faced so much
humiliation because of me...

1986
02:17:54,708 --> 02:17:57,083
- ...tell him to forgive me.
- Oh!

1987
02:17:57,415 --> 02:18:00,540
- Oh...
- Madam, don't scream!

1988
02:18:00,624 --> 02:18:03,165
- Please, don't scream. This is a station.
- I want my daughter.

1989
02:18:03,249 --> 02:18:05,708
- Okay, okay...
- I want my daughter.

1990
02:18:05,915 --> 02:18:08,165
Where did she go?

1991
02:18:08,208 --> 02:18:10,499
I want to see her...

1992
02:18:16,999 --> 02:18:19,458
Have patience. Please, come here.

1993
02:18:20,583 --> 02:18:22,749
Take her outside.
You go and sit outside. Please, go.

1994
02:18:22,833 --> 02:18:23,749
Please, come.

1995
02:18:23,833 --> 02:18:24,833
Come, let's go out.

1996
02:18:24,915 --> 02:18:26,665
Ranganath, send a message
to the control room.

1997
02:18:26,749 --> 02:18:28,458
- Have patience.
- Mail this photo, okay?

1998
02:18:28,540 --> 02:18:29,999
Okay, sir.

1999
02:18:30,083 --> 02:18:31,833
You go and wait outside.

2000
02:18:31,915 --> 02:18:34,290
- Hey, take him out. Ramesh, take him.
- Get up. Let's go.

2001
02:18:34,665 --> 02:18:36,874
- Take him out.
- Let's go, come on.

2002
02:19:48,208 --> 02:19:50,041
Krishna, sir wants to
take you somewhere. Come.

2003
02:19:50,124 --> 02:19:52,958
- Where?
- I don't know. Ask sir.

2004
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:54,290
Brother-in-law...

2005
02:19:56,749 --> 02:19:59,249
Sir, sir... what happened, sir?
Where are you going?

2006
02:19:59,333 --> 02:20:00,999
You get inside. I will tell you.

2007
02:20:01,083 --> 02:20:03,374
- Sir...
- Get inside. Start the car.

2008
02:20:26,166 --> 02:20:30,250
Hey, move back...
Move back. Come on, move.

2009
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Sir, what is this?
Why is the ambulance here?

2010
02:20:35,083 --> 02:20:36,583
So many people are here?

2011
02:20:36,666 --> 02:20:37,957
Sir, tell me what happened?

2012
02:20:41,166 --> 02:20:45,541
Half an hour ago, a girl committed
suicide by jumping in front of the train.

2013
02:20:46,333 --> 02:20:49,291
Madam, we couldn't recognize her face.
You be calm.

2014
02:20:49,583 --> 02:20:51,416
Go and identify the body first.

2015
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:53,125
Please, go.

2016
02:21:01,083 --> 02:21:02,583
You stand here.

2017
02:21:32,208 --> 02:21:33,666
No, sir.

2018
02:22:02,708 --> 02:22:05,708
Sir, I was waiting for
Leela to get out of my life.

2019
02:22:06,958 --> 02:22:09,083
I wanted to divorce
her and send her away.

2020
02:22:10,708 --> 02:22:12,250
But she left on her own.

2021
02:22:13,791 --> 02:22:16,000
Sir, she's told that
I am not at fault.

2022
02:22:17,375 --> 02:22:22,500
Then, if something happens to her,
how can I stay calm?

2023
02:22:23,708 --> 02:22:25,333
Sir, do you want me to stay calm?

2024
02:22:26,625 --> 02:22:27,833
No...

2025
02:22:32,166 --> 02:22:34,916
Sir, I can't stay calm.

2026
02:22:36,958 --> 02:22:38,500
Sir, I can't.

2027
02:22:40,916 --> 02:22:44,375
Sir, I feel like crying
when I think of her.

2028
02:22:44,708 --> 02:22:47,875
- Sir, I feel like crying.
- People like you have the same problem...

2029
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:51,916
...when you are together, you fight,
but when you are away, you cry.

2030
02:22:52,791 --> 02:22:54,707
What kind of a life do you live?

2031
02:22:57,791 --> 02:22:59,000
Sir, I don't know.

2032
02:23:01,916 --> 02:23:03,957
I don't know what life I am living.

2033
02:23:05,666 --> 02:23:08,457
Sir, since I've come to my senses...

2034
02:23:09,291 --> 02:23:11,457
...I've been carrying
the burden of life.

2035
02:23:14,125 --> 02:23:16,750
Every morning,
the same story of loan and interest...

2036
02:23:16,958 --> 02:23:19,458
...I never thought about my future...

2037
02:23:21,541 --> 02:23:23,582
...I never fell in love.

2038
02:23:24,708 --> 02:23:28,458
Sir, this is the reason
that when Leela was close to me...

2039
02:23:29,291 --> 02:23:31,416
...I always got angry on her...

2040
02:23:32,625 --> 02:23:35,041
...but never understood love for her.

2041
02:23:38,291 --> 02:23:41,291
Sir, now I know... but...

2042
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,416
Sir, if something
happens to my Leela...

2043
02:23:52,291 --> 02:23:53,666
...I will not live.

2044
02:23:54,083 --> 02:23:55,708
I will also commit suicide
by jumping in front a train...

2045
02:23:55,791 --> 02:23:56,750
Krishna, listen to me.

2046
02:23:56,833 --> 02:23:58,208
Sir, I swear by my mother, I will die.

2047
02:23:58,291 --> 02:24:00,541
- No, it is wrong.
- I'll die, sir.

2048
02:24:00,625 --> 02:24:02,666
Calm down... calm down.

2049
02:24:23,625 --> 02:24:27,291
<i>"Did you come to cheat me?"</i>

2050
02:24:28,791 --> 02:24:31,957
Leela called...
it is missed call from Leela.

2051
02:24:32,041 --> 02:24:33,666
Call her back.

2052
02:24:38,125 --> 02:24:40,166
It is ringing.

2053
02:24:41,166 --> 02:24:43,332
- Hello Leela... Leela?
- Krishna.

2054
02:24:43,416 --> 02:24:45,291
Please listen to me for two minutes.

2055
02:24:45,333 --> 02:24:47,708
Forget that,
tell me where are you now?

2056
02:24:48,166 --> 02:24:49,916
I am in Nandi Hills.

2057
02:24:50,291 --> 02:24:52,207
Nandi Hills? What are you doing there?

2058
02:24:57,750 --> 02:24:59,333
Tell me what are you doing there?

2059
02:25:00,750 --> 02:25:04,875
Krishna, I like you very much.

2060
02:25:08,291 --> 02:25:12,916
But what do I do? You don't like me.

2061
02:25:14,625 --> 02:25:18,500
So, I came here to commit suicide.

2062
02:25:18,708 --> 02:25:21,041
- Hey Leela... Leela!
- For the last time...

2063
02:25:22,041 --> 02:25:24,625
...I felt like talking to you.

2064
02:25:24,958 --> 02:25:26,791
So, I called you.

2065
02:25:27,083 --> 02:25:30,250
Leela, listen to me.
Please, don't do any such thing.

2066
02:25:30,333 --> 02:25:32,083
Leela, I can't live without you.

2067
02:25:32,166 --> 02:25:35,082
Leela... hello Leela? Leela!

2068
02:25:35,583 --> 02:25:37,666
- Hello?
- What happened?

2069
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:39,416
Tell me what did Leela tell you?
Tell me.

2070
02:25:39,500 --> 02:25:42,416
- What happened?
- Sir, Leela is at Nandi Hills.

2071
02:25:42,583 --> 02:25:43,416
I am not able to reach her, sir.

2072
02:25:49,958 --> 02:25:55,666
- "I will wait for you."
- 'Switched off.'

2073
02:25:56,500 --> 02:26:02,166
- "I love you very much."
- 'Please try again later.'

2074
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:09,166
<i>"My heart is calling out for you."</i>

2075
02:26:09,458 --> 02:26:15,291
- "Please, listen to my plea."
- 'Number is switched off.'

2076
02:26:19,708 --> 02:26:26,375
<i>"If I get you, I will live."</i>

2077
02:26:26,458 --> 02:26:33,541
<i>"O darling, please return to me."</i>

2078
02:26:46,125 --> 02:26:49,208
Leela! Leela!

2079
02:26:50,333 --> 02:26:53,000
Leela! Leela!

2080
02:26:54,458 --> 02:26:56,416
Leela!

2081
02:26:57,208 --> 02:27:00,166
Leela! Leela!

2082
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,500
- Krishna!
- Leela!

2083
02:27:24,083 --> 02:27:27,041
Hey silly girl,
fool, are you out of your mind?

2084
02:27:27,125 --> 02:27:29,083
Why did you hang up
the phone while talking?

2085
02:27:29,291 --> 02:27:32,125
I didn't hang up. The battery
got over and it got disconnected.

2086
02:27:32,208 --> 02:27:35,250
If it got disconnected, you should've
taken somebody's phone and called.

2087
02:27:35,333 --> 02:27:38,041
I did... your phone was switched off.

2088
02:27:38,250 --> 02:27:40,500
My battery got over
trying to call you.

2089
02:27:40,791 --> 02:27:42,250
Hey, Krishna!

2090
02:27:42,416 --> 02:27:44,666
You were obstinate
that you want Leela...

2091
02:27:44,750 --> 02:27:46,625
...if not you'll commit suicide
on railway tracks.

2092
02:27:46,708 --> 02:27:48,166
Then why are you fighting with her?

2093
02:27:54,291 --> 02:27:58,082
Yes, dear. He loves you very much.

2094
02:27:58,166 --> 02:28:00,375
But he didn't realize it till now.

2095
02:28:06,083 --> 02:28:08,875
- Leela...
- Mother. Mother.

2096
02:28:09,791 --> 02:28:13,875
Hey haughty man, you were
the reason for all that happened.

2097
02:28:13,958 --> 02:28:16,541
Hereafter, swear that
you'll be loving towards...

2098
02:28:16,625 --> 02:28:18,208
...your daughter and won't abuse her.

2099
02:28:19,541 --> 02:28:20,916
Go on!

2100
02:28:25,291 --> 02:28:26,457
Father...

2101
02:28:27,125 --> 02:28:30,541
Many lovers have fallen to
death from this Nandi Hills till now.

2102
02:28:30,625 --> 02:28:33,291
You are the first one
who are meeting here.

2103
02:28:33,333 --> 02:28:34,708
At least now the blot will be washed.

2104
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:40,958
<i>"Leela calling Krishna, come, come."</i>

2105
02:28:42,541 --> 02:28:47,957
<i>"Leela waiting Krishna darling."</i>

2106
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:01,708
<i>"Your sound is inside my heart."</i>

2107
02:29:01,791 --> 02:29:05,375
<i>"I feel for you in my heart."</i>

2108
02:29:05,583 --> 02:29:11,750
<i>"There are thousands
of matinee shows in my eyes."</i>

2109
02:29:12,375 --> 02:29:19,458
<i>"There's a funfair
of your dreams at night."</i>

2110
02:29:19,958 --> 02:29:24,875
<i>"Krishna calling Leela darling,
come, come."</i>

2111
02:29:26,666 --> 02:29:31,582
<i>"Krishna waiting Leela darling,
come, come."</i>

2112
02:29:33,208 --> 02:29:39,166
<i>"Leela calling Krishna darling,
come, come."</i>

2113
02:29:39,791 --> 02:29:44,416
<i>"Leela waiting Krishna darling,
come, come."</i>

2114
02:29:59,750 --> 02:30:03,041
<i>"On the road of life...</i>

2115
02:30:03,083 --> 02:30:06,208
<i>...there's only your board."</i>

2116
02:30:06,291 --> 02:30:09,500
<i>"I will give you...</i>

2117
02:30:09,583 --> 02:30:12,875
<i>...a card with love daily."</i>

2118
02:30:12,958 --> 02:30:16,208
<i>"In the court of heart...</i>

2119
02:30:16,291 --> 02:30:19,582
<i>...a case has been put on hold."</i>

2120
02:30:19,666 --> 02:30:26,082
<i>"Battery is getting over,
phase has changed."</i>

2121
02:30:26,166 --> 02:30:33,416
<i>"The camera of my eyes
are looking for your face only."</i>

2122
02:30:34,458 --> 02:30:39,416
<i>"Leela calling Krishna darling,
come, come."</i>

2123
02:30:41,083 --> 02:30:46,041
<i>"Leela waiting Krishna darling,
come, come."</i>

2124
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:52,666
<i>"Krishna calling Leela darling,
come, come."</i>

2125
02:30:54,375 --> 02:30:59,333
<i>"Krishna waiting Leela darling,
come, come."</i>
