1
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,800
Forgive me, Mother.
I could do nothing for you.

2
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:35,973
You're sacrificing your life
for your Motherland.

3
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:40,501
What more can you do for me?

4
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,842
Go, son.

5
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,787
Long Live, India.

6
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:02,933
The General will still pardon you.

7
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:06,228
Tell him the whereabouts of
the traitors and save yourself.

8
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,603
I know just one traitor.

9
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:11,502
And that's you!

10
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:59,814
Long Live, India!

11
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:12,792
1 942 - 9th August

12
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:17,597
In every corner of India,
there was but one echo...

13
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:24,367
Quit India!
We'll do, or die.

14
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:27,939
As the Independence Movement spread,

15
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,245
...the atrocities of
the British worsened.

16
00:06:32,617 --> 00:06:36,519
The man behind them
was General Douglas.

17
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:39,982
Who murdered many
unarmed men.

18
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,927
And hung many a freedom fighter.

19
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:48,198
But even in death,
they had but one thing to say.

20
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:51,029
''We'll do, or die!''

21
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,132
''We'll do, or die!''

22
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:23,994
''1 2 dead in Delhi
in police-firing''

23
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:30,698
- They razed the whole town.
- Easy. Go on reading.

24
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:38,148
General Douglas is going back
to England on the 25th...

25
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:41,318
...on promotion!

26
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:47,148
If I had my way,
I'd hang the bloody dog!

27
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:53,092
Carry on reading.

28
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:59,334
Before that,there'll be a Regimental
Farewell Parade at Kasauni.

29
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:03,939
How long will he be there?

30
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,579
For a day. Just one day.

31
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:12,075
One day, eh?

32
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:16,948
There's Govind there.
And Mr Baig too.

33
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:20,685
This is the only chance
to finish him off!.

34
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:24,992
The General will go to Kasauni...
but, never return!

35
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:28,097
- Father, this is my...
- No, son.

36
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,637
Only one man for this job!
...Shubhankar!

37
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:39,906
You can help him. But first,
I'll go there myself.

38
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:42,410
To make the bomb.

39
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:46,978
Inform Govind today itself.

40
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:50,714
But don't tell him anything
about the mission.

41
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,988
Just say, I'm not keeping well.

42
00:08:55,593 --> 00:08:59,962
So I'm coming there for treatment.
Very soon.

43
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:52,441
It has sprouted here too, eh?

44
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:57,344
Great! Just listen to them;
We'll do, or die.

45
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,084
More will die, than do, sir.

46
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:02,524
Then what are you waiting for?
Shoot them.

47
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,285
They too must know
the repercussions of...

48
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,457
...raising their voice
against the British Raj.

49
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:11,366
And this is being done because
the General is coming here.

50
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:16,664
Some trouble's brewing.

51
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,502
It's not the General who's coming,
but some calamity.

52
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:24,812
Let it be the General or Hitler.
What's it to you? Just shut up!

53
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:29,845
How can I? Firing in Delhi;
Curfew in Old Delhi.

54
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:33,746
Women raped by soldiers, and you
exxpect me to keep quiet?

55
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:38,194
If ever this man crosses my path,
I swear, I'll spit on him.

56
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:42,757
He'll be here nextx week.
Spit on him and fulfill your wish.

57
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:46,160
I'll do that, if your father
doesn't kill me first!

58
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:48,135
Put your tail in, eh?

59
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,901
Coward!
Spit on Douglas, will you?

60
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,184
If I had my way,
I'll kill each one of them!

61
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:13,554
This fire has been ignited
by some outsiders.

62
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:18,794
As long as I'm the C.O. here,
nobody will dare to commit treason.

63
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:28,645
It won't last...
the British Rule won't last long.

64
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:42,822
Pull that flag down.

65
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:45,323
Lower that flag.

66
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:02,439
Push them back!

67
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,900
Hey!
Look what's happening.

68
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,717
Stop him! Go, man.

69
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,721
What are you doing? Gone mad?
Your father's livid. Let's go.

70
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:04,892
You should be ashamed!
My son, doing such a thing?

71
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:10,798
I'll not put up with this at all.
At least think of my reputation.

72
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:14,108
If you're dying for
Independence too...

73
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:16,745
...then remove
the Western clothes.

74
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:20,848
Wear Khadi ones, and stand at
crossroads and shout slogans!

75
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:25,017
Did you hear what I said?

76
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,330
They are here again?

77
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:39,596
The Government has confiscated their
land and money. They'll starve.

78
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,967
When their son was siding with the
traitors, were they sleeping?

79
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:48,337
If you allow them in here again,
you'll be out! Understand?

80
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:07,094
What's happened?
What has never happened before!

81
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:09,426
Fights, riots, madness!

82
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:14,972
Here I am, trying to hold on to my
status and there,your darling son...

83
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:18,442
- What about him?
- Gets beaten up by a constable!

84
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:20,740
Heavens!
He's not hurt, is he?

85
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,117
You're alright, aren't you, son?

86
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,891
Hey! She's not here.

87
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,795
But I know where she is.

88
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,200
- Where?
- It was lying here.

89
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:25,433
Does this ear-ring belong
to somebody close to you?

90
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,379
Yes; it does.

91
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:43,427
Where had you gone
with this horse?

92
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:45,952
To find her...the girl in the bus.

93
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:48,965
- What bus and which girl?
- That bus in the Town's square.

94
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:54,268
Whose glass was stoned; that's when
I saw her and kept on staring.

95
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:57,533
I must admire your sight.

96
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:03,647
In all that riot, noise, stoning, you
saw someone, and kept on looking...

97
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,343
- Don't laugh; but come with me.
- How can I?

98
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:09,216
Come home tomorrow.
We'll find her by afternoon.

99
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:13,280
Our town's so small. Nobody can get
lost, even if one wishes to!

100
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:16,818
Tomorrow it is!
Come now.

101
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:19,457
Where are you running me off to?

102
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:23,962
May I ask you something?

103
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:27,429
When the whole country's burning,
how could you think of love?

104
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:33,444
If everyone thought of Love, why
would India burn at all? See this?

105
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:37,169
Great! People pick pockets. Did
you cut-off somebody's ears?

106
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,780
By this, you can imagine how
the wearer must be!

107
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,179
I could guess wrongly,
so better tell me yourself.

108
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:47,115
Very beautiful. In fact, even
that doesn't do justice to it.

109
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:50,326
When I saw her,
it was as though...

110
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:53,593
You understand, don't you?
I'll exxplain it.

111
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:58,659
- I saw her, and...
- I got that. Go on.

112
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:03,502
When I saw her,
I felt as though...

113
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:08,337
Do one thing. Think all night and
tell me when you come tomorrow. Bye!

114
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:16,314
Hey! When I saw her, it was
as though...as though what?

115
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:58,792
How come you found your way here
so early today?

116
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,164
You're getting worried, but he's
hardly aware of the time and duty.

117
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:10,574
You're too lenient with him.
As they say...

118
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:15,411
When a mouse finds a turmeric-root,
it thinks itself to be a grocer!

119
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:17,352
Open the door, friend.

120
00:23:18,388 --> 00:23:23,291
His door may break,
but he won't wake!

121
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,861
Show affection to someone,
who's worth the trouble. Understand?

122
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,090
Let's go...

123
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,866
Let's go, I say.
Where are you?

124
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,209
- What's the matter? Let's go.
- Where to?

125
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:19,415
- To look for that girl. Where else?
- But I found her.

126
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:22,849
- Found her? Where?
- Up There.

127
00:24:24,154 --> 00:24:28,318
This one? Is this the cartoon
you saw and lost your heart to?

128
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,286
She's Aunty!

129
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:34,194
Whom have you fallen for?

130
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,830
Tea, father.

131
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:48,234
- What's wrong?
- I'm alright. You go.

132
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:54,375
Have you told her?

133
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,586
No, I haven't.

134
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,483
She has suffered enough already.

135
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:04,152
And this mission is so dangerous,
she'll worry unnecessarily.

136
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:06,321
You did well.

137
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:11,225
I told my wife that you're
here to take treatment.

138
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:14,999
She got worried.
She said ask him to stay with us.

139
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:17,472
- Else, I'd have...
- No, this room will do.

140
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:23,205
I'll be coughing away here and
nobody will disturb us.

141
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,582
My wife wants to
go to her Mother's.

142
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:37,660
- Why?
- After 1 2 years...

143
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,423
...God has smiled on her.

144
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:42,558
She's pregnant.

145
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:48,569
Really? That's good news.
Congratulations.

146
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:56,671
- These books?
- They're my daughter's.

147
00:25:57,147 --> 00:26:00,947
- A voracious reader. Pens poems too.
- Really?

148
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,745
We've a good library here.

149
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:07,522
Good!
Then she'll be happy here.

150
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:12,687
When I go to Abid Ali,
I'll drop her here.

151
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:17,293
- Coming; You're up, are you?
- What are you eating on the sly?

152
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:21,267
- Have some. It's Holy offering.
- Give some to Master Naren too.

153
00:26:21,772 --> 00:26:23,706
- What's this?
- Don't get scared.

154
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,199
He's the driver
of an aristocrat.

155
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:30,405
Very fond ofjust one thing.
Non-stop chatter!

156
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:35,183
I'll do one thing.
I'll tell him about your illness.

157
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:40,182
By evening, the whole town will know
you're here for treatment.

158
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:46,724
Father, your medicine.

159
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:01,606
Careful, my dear friend.

160
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:05,479
Never mind the father.
Tell me about the daughter.

161
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:10,320
She must be able to support herself.
She's gone to the library.

162
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,312
Hold on. I lied for you for
the first time in my life.

163
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:16,493
Actually it opens at 9 A.M.
But I told him, at 8 A.M.

164
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:20,953
The watchman there is related to me.
Bribe him and he'll open it earlier.

165
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,934
After that, it's just you and her.
On that first meeting...

166
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,062
Recite a lovely couplet to her,
like my uncle had recited.

167
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:31,241
My aunt was drying her hair
in the sun, and my uncle...

168
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:35,109
Let me go, please.
No poetry.

169
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,954
I just knew you'd come here
in search of knowledge.

170
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:26,996
This library is a
Trove of Knowledge.

171
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,327
Books? These are scientific.
They tell, why the sky is blue.

172
00:28:32,736 --> 00:28:37,230
And these are of literature, telling
why did Juliette love Romeo!

173
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:43,941
And these are of accounts,
that tell this is our 3rd meeting.

174
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:49,085
Yesterday, in the bus. Today morning
on the swing; And now, here.

175
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:53,280
Since we're discussing accounts,
naturally one wishes to know...

176
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:58,260
Who are you; Where you've come
from...and also what is your name!

177
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:14,100
Are you the librarian here?

178
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:19,506
Do I seem one to you?
Anyway, you at least enquired.

179
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,375
Now ask me, where I come from,
and my name too!

180
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,953
Go on, ask me.

181
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:28,481
- Let go of me.
- Go on, ask.

182
00:29:28,992 --> 00:29:34,294
I have one thing of yours which you
will get, only if you ask me my name.

183
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,122
- Let me go.
- Ask me my name then.

184
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,634
What impertinence!
Let me go.

185
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:42,001
You're cross over such a small issue?
Go on, ask me.

186
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,844
Look at the ironies of life.
We both yearned to meet.

187
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:24,519
And when we are, it's on the sly,
like a couple of thieves!

188
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:27,352
- Nobody saw you come?
- No.

189
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:34,829
The General has a very tight
security. But one thing is certain.

190
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:38,024
He'll definitely attend the drama,
we're presenting to welcome him.

191
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:41,533
He'll be in the balcony.
It's a difficultjob, no doubt.

192
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,398
- Shubhankar is coming, isn't he?
- Yes.

193
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:59,353
Here's the raw material for the bomb.
And this is the map of the hall.

194
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:04,449
- Is your daughter with you?
- Yes, but she doesn't know this.

195
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:10,329
Good! Send her to the rehearsal
and send me the news through her.

196
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,664
- Now we'll not meet again.
- Is this a final one then?

197
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,261
God forbid!

198
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:22,733
- Victory to India!
- Amen!

199
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:50,766
Who is it?
Just one minute.

200
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:02,984
- Why did you close the door?
- I felt very cold.

201
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:05,445
Keep it here.

202
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,282
- Lovely!
- Come on now, start eating.

203
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:15,296
- You look very happy.
- It's a lovely place.

204
00:36:15,665 --> 00:36:18,133
- I feel like staying here only.
- Then do.

205
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:20,498
The library's good too, I hear.

206
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:24,270
Such a library, such books...

207
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,309
Such people even.
Never seen before.

208
00:36:29,412 --> 00:36:33,246
You had gone to see Uncle Baig.
How is he?

209
00:36:33,616 --> 00:36:37,416
Fine. He's busy with a play.
Has called you for assistance.

210
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:41,355
- Me?
- Yes. Tomorrow, at 1 0 A.M.

211
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,884
And tell him he has forgotten to
give me the white medicine.

212
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:48,755
Good! You at least found time here,
to think of your treatment.

213
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:52,696
You'll get well here soon.
I just feel it.

214
00:36:55,438 --> 00:36:58,965
- Why does aunty shout so?
- But she means well. So go now.

215
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:13,987
One soldier on that balcony
and another one here.

216
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,081
You on that gate, and you,
on the other.

217
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:21,591
Ten soldiers in the hall.
Four soldiers up here.

218
00:37:21,664 --> 00:37:24,394
And you shall be at the gate
with your whole platoon.

219
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,798
- Wonderful! Don't trust me even?
- Am I mad, sir?

220
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:31,265
Do I want to invite my death
by suspecting you?

221
00:37:31,307 --> 00:37:33,969
- Then why are you here?
- Just for security.

222
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:39,315
Ever since the general's arrival,
the treachery is on the rise.

223
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:44,617
Where everyone knows each other,
nobody will dare come.

224
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,050
You don't know their guts.

225
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:53,319
There's a revolutionary
present here itself.

226
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,694
What? Who?

227
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:58,998
See over there.

228
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:10,437
Here? She's a sweet, promising and
a decent girl. Acts well too.

229
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,972
Who'll guess she's your kid?

230
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,887
You teachers leave nobody!
Not even your friends.

231
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:23,750
What was that couplet you recited?
''O friend, you're my foe...''

232
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,387
''Any man,
whom you befriend...''

233
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:31,397
''Why should the
sky be his foe?''

234
00:38:32,735 --> 00:38:34,430
Please go!
We're getting late here.

235
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,871
I've to go on some
urgent errand too.

236
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:41,907
Alright, my dear. See sir?
She calls the shots even here!

237
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,413
God bless you!

238
00:38:46,182 --> 00:38:48,241
Why don't you understand?
I must go.

239
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,617
- She must've come. You manage here.
-Manage, my foot! Will I play Romeo?

240
00:38:51,654 --> 00:38:54,724
- Where are you going?
- It's imperative that I go.

241
00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:58,387
The rehearsal's important too.
You're forgetting the lines, not me.

242
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:00,962
You talk of books?
He's forgotten his name!

243
00:39:01,264 --> 00:39:04,927
- Books? What books?
- The one with lines in them.

244
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:08,260
- Keep jabbering. I'm going!
- Stop him!

245
00:39:09,238 --> 00:39:11,229
I can't! I must go.

246
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:14,968
- What's the urgency for books?
- You won't understand.

247
00:39:25,888 --> 00:39:28,254
Go on then...
Why did you stop?

248
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:33,461
When is the General coming?

249
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:36,855
- Yes, when is he exxpected?
- Nextx week. Why?

250
00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:39,697
And I'm leaving? We're doing
this for him, aren't we?

251
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:44,564
You're right. I must learn my lines.
I don't know why I forget them.

252
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:49,068
- The General will sit here...
- Baig Uncle.

253
00:39:50,046 --> 00:39:53,106
- My dear! How are you?
- I'm fine.

254
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:57,811
That are you! If you help me in this,
I'll say you're even finer!

255
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,524
Uncle, daddy said...

256
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,354
- Do I put some flowers here too?
- Yes, all over.

257
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,127
Yes, what did he say?

258
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:09,026
He said you forgot
the white medicine.

259
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:12,501
Tell him, I'll send it today.

260
00:40:12,735 --> 00:40:17,763
Take this. The actors always forget
their lines. Prompt them, please.

261
00:40:21,978 --> 00:40:26,005
Put phosphorous in a medicine bottle
and give it to Mr Pathak.

262
00:40:26,082 --> 00:40:28,778
- Tell him, when Shubhankar arrives..
- Is he coming?

263
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:33,948
This moon shines through you.
Shall I swear by it?

264
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:38,454
No. It waxxes and wanes.
Don't swear by it.

265
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:43,830
I believe in you.
My body, mind and life...

266
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,533
- What are the following lines?
- Lines?

267
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:51,504
But what's your name, dearest?

268
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,945
Knowing name is not knowing a person.
It's just a name, not a virtue.

269
00:40:58,114 --> 00:41:01,015
Had the rose been known as a thorn,
it would still smell as sweetly.

270
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:03,914
If water had been called fire,
it'd still be cool.

271
00:41:04,153 --> 00:41:06,587
Change my name, if you will,
but I'll still be the same.

272
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:10,555
I'll always love you...
what's the nextx line?

273
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:14,530
- ''Because you are you...''
- Yes.

274
00:41:15,064 --> 00:41:17,658
Because you are you.

275
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,770
I know that it
wasn't an act.

276
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,042
It was your love for me.

277
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:32,678
How easily you put across
your true feelings.

278
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:38,013
And I...I don't even
know your name.

279
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:49,794
You know I wasn't acting.
It was my love. For you.

280
00:41:52,668 --> 00:41:55,068
You! What are you doing here?
Go away.

281
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:59,574
- You didn't ask me my name.
- Softly. They'll wake up. Go now.

282
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:04,137
- I'll come up then.
- What the hell! Don't come up.

283
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:09,310
Don't come up, I said.
You'll fall!

284
00:42:20,296 --> 00:42:25,165
Don't ever let go of this hand.
Else, I'll die.

285
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:29,033
- Don't say that.
- Okay, I won't.

286
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:33,574
Just let me look at you
to my heart's content.

287
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:36,904
Those lips; these eyes;

288
00:42:39,215 --> 00:42:40,580
These eyelashes...

289
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:57,799
Leave me. Go away.
Somebody may wake up. Go!

290
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:01,027
Okay.
But promise to come early tomorrow.

291
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:03,364
- Where?
- The Rehearsal Hall.

292
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:08,605
- Okay, I'll come a bit early.
- Not a bit early; before everyone.

293
00:43:08,778 --> 00:43:12,145
- Okay, go now. Someone may hear.
- How can I go?

294
00:43:12,448 --> 00:43:15,747
- Why not?
- You're holding on to my hand.

295
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:21,517
- Listen...
- Yes?

296
00:43:22,091 --> 00:43:24,059
- You didn't tell me.
- What?

297
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,427
- Your name?
- My name?

298
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:20,241
We've got a message from the H.Q.
There's a plot to kill the General.

299
00:49:20,616 --> 00:49:24,416
Some are here; and more exxpected.
They also have material for a bomb.

300
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:28,084
The H.Q. have requested
the Army for help.

301
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:36,455
Call an officer's meeting at once
and arm the 2 companies concerned.

302
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:48,669
Careful.

303
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:37,816
Tell Mr Baig that
the job is done.

304
00:51:38,654 --> 00:51:41,179
Keep the bomb here
in this room.

305
00:51:42,324 --> 00:51:45,661
It's raining heavily.
The roads are teeming with police.

306
00:51:45,661 --> 00:51:49,431
They're searching all the houses.
Our friends are exxpected. What now?

307
00:51:49,431 --> 00:51:52,730
Get a hold of yourself!.
Let's go.

308
00:51:53,635 --> 00:51:55,865
Carry on with the rehearsal.
I'll be back soon.

309
00:51:55,938 --> 00:51:58,429
Right, Sir.
Come on, let's get on with it.

310
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:04,802
- Someone will snatch you from me...
- Who can dare to do that?

311
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,445
Has anyone ever snatched life from
one's body? Sleep from the eyes...

312
00:52:08,517 --> 00:52:11,315
And thirst from the lips?

313
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:15,157
Time can, if it wills.

314
00:52:15,157 --> 00:52:20,720
No! That's not true! I'll snatch
you from Time itself then.

315
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:26,427
- Promise me Rajjo...
- I'm not Rajjo, Naren.

316
00:52:27,336 --> 00:52:30,794
It's just that...

317
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:45,676
Wait!
Please listen to me.

318
00:52:46,588 --> 00:52:50,888
Forgive me, but don't blame me.
Blame my love.

319
00:52:51,426 --> 00:52:53,724
Is it necessary
to flaunt love?

320
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:57,654
I wasn't flaunting.
They were my true feelings.

321
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,835
And I truly love you.

322
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,396
I can't live without you.

323
00:53:05,073 --> 00:53:09,169
Will you marry me?

324
00:57:30,872 --> 00:57:35,275
Rajjo was right. I'm just coming
from down. The atmosphere is tense.

325
00:57:35,544 --> 00:57:38,069
I think the Army has come
to know about our mission.

326
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:41,841
- Your life's in danger. Go at once!
- And leave my work incomplete?

327
00:57:42,117 --> 00:57:45,985
Our friends are coming tomorrow.
I can't leave.

328
00:57:46,454 --> 00:57:49,617
I'm here. I'll manage it all.
Your life...

329
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:51,656
Don't worry about my life.

330
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:56,019
You said your wife wished
to visit her mother's place.

331
00:57:56,531 --> 00:58:00,831
- Send her tomorrow morning.
- And what about Rajjo?

332
00:58:01,336 --> 00:58:05,102
I'll take care of her.

333
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:47,372
- It's a riot there and you sit here!
- You! I thought it was her.

334
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:49,508
- Now scoot from here.
- Ofcourse. I'll run all the way.

335
00:58:50,252 --> 00:58:52,277
But it's your turn now.
So run!

336
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:56,021
She's leaving town.
Lock, stock and barrel.

337
00:58:56,758 --> 00:59:01,354
I saw her luggage being loaded.
The bus will leave soon. So, run!

338
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:05,491
I'm telling the truth.
Better hurry, and go!

339
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:17,641
I've been telling for days now.
Pack my things. But who listens?

340
00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:20,612
Careful! Keep it safely.

341
00:59:26,288 --> 00:59:29,416
- When will we start?
- As soon as we can.

342
00:59:29,557 --> 00:59:31,388
I've to go to Nurgadh.

343
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:36,290
- On the other side of the pass.
- Sure! We'll go there too.

344
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:47,874
Hey! You won't get a seat.
The bus may go too. Come on.

345
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:52,804
If we don't get a seat, we'll have
to go standing all the way!

346
00:59:53,081 --> 00:59:57,609
- And keep on eye on things.
- Are you coming with us, or not?

347
01:00:58,747 --> 01:01:03,116
I thought you...
You can never leave me.

348
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:07,222
Promise me, dear,
that you'll never leave me.

349
01:01:07,222 --> 01:01:11,124
What is it?
I was little late in coming.

350
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:14,418
Aunty's gone to her mother's. I had
to see her off at the bus stand.

351
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:20,568
And I thought you went away forever.
Never to return.

352
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:25,996
And suppose, I do have
to go one day?

353
01:01:26,775 --> 01:01:29,801
Then I'll die.
I'll really die.

354
01:01:30,512 --> 01:01:34,539
Promise me that you will
never leave me!

355
01:01:38,753 --> 01:01:42,086
How can I ever leave
my father alone and go?

356
01:01:44,025 --> 01:01:47,017
And what of me?
Can you leave me?

357
01:01:49,097 --> 01:01:50,621
Yes, I can...

358
01:07:03,244 --> 01:07:06,805
- Hey! What's wrong, dear?
- Nothing.

359
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,313
Then why the tears?

360
01:07:14,188 --> 01:07:16,383
Won't you tell me?

361
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:20,891
If not you,
then whom do I tell?

362
01:07:21,763 --> 01:07:24,254
Whom else do I have?

363
01:07:25,566 --> 01:07:28,057
Has anybody broken your heart?

364
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,994
- Naren hasn't...
- Papa...

365
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:37,268
Why would he hurt me?
I've hurt myself.

366
01:07:38,613 --> 01:07:41,309
I can't do the Juliette's role.

367
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,178
Why not?

368
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:49,584
I keep forgetting my lines.

369
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,555
Is that any reason to cry?

370
01:07:54,996 --> 01:07:58,932
An army officer's daughter and
look how she's crying!

371
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:06,666
All these efforts are a waste.
I just cannot laugh today.

372
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:09,466
Perseverance never
goes waste, dear.

373
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:14,071
We both are persevering
and living, aren't we?

374
01:08:14,816 --> 01:08:20,516
Else, when your mother died,
leaving a 2-month old infant...

375
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:25,590
I thought it was the end.

376
01:08:35,603 --> 01:08:39,437
Look, my dear.
I can bear to see everything.

377
01:08:40,374 --> 01:08:43,172
But not tears in your eyes.

378
01:08:47,215 --> 01:08:51,709
An army-officer...
And see how he's weeping!

379
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:59,785
Alright.
I'll never cry again.

380
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:03,662
It's not a must that every
girl be a Juliette.

381
01:09:13,007 --> 01:09:14,975
Some revolutionaries are
coming here tonight.

382
01:09:15,543 --> 01:09:19,912
I'll do the patrolling myself.
Make all the preparations.

383
01:09:58,386 --> 01:10:00,081
Catch him alive.

384
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:44,293
Govind, get some water and bandages
We've to dress his wound

385
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:38,814
They killed Tyagi.

386
01:11:43,124 --> 01:11:47,959
- Shubhankar...wired us...
- Yes, go on.

387
01:11:48,496 --> 01:11:53,297
Douglas...
He's not coming on 25th.

388
01:11:54,902 --> 01:12:01,068
But 1 0 days later.

389
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:09,575
With a great difficulty...

390
01:12:11,652 --> 01:12:16,783
This pistol...Shubhankar's.

391
01:12:55,262 --> 01:12:56,490
My dear.

392
01:12:58,466 --> 01:13:02,869
Your one more
brother has gone!

393
01:13:06,907 --> 01:13:08,636
But we'll win.

394
01:13:10,478 --> 01:13:12,378
We'll definitely win!

395
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:17,480
As long as we're together...

396
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,448
Shubhankar is not alone.

397
01:13:27,294 --> 01:13:31,594
You are with me,
aren't you?

398
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:33,834
Tell me.

399
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:38,437
Surround this house, men.

400
01:13:39,106 --> 01:13:42,303
Must be hiding here only.
Don't let him escape. Hurry!

401
01:13:56,423 --> 01:13:59,358
Open the door.
We've to search this house.

402
01:14:00,027 --> 01:14:03,929
-But I'm the manager of his Lordship.
- And we have a warrant to search.

403
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,362
- We've chased a traitor here.
- But no traitor has come here.

404
01:14:08,969 --> 01:14:11,699
Get aside!
Come with me, men.

405
01:14:13,374 --> 01:14:17,401
You go here. And you lot, there.
The rest follow me!

406
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:24,813
Didn't I say nobody's here?
Disturb us for no rhyme or reason?

407
01:14:29,323 --> 01:14:33,851
- See? Nobody's here.
- Keep quiet. Let us do our duty.

408
01:15:23,244 --> 01:15:27,237
We'll do, or die!

409
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:03,109
- How did things change overnight?
- We can never be one!

410
01:16:04,585 --> 01:16:08,817
Forget that you ever loved
a revolutionary's daughter.

411
01:16:09,923 --> 01:16:12,687
Forget that we ever met.

412
01:16:13,827 --> 01:16:16,887
Don't try to meet me now.

413
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:21,395
I'm going. Forever.

414
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:41,586
Told him everything?
Didn't think of our ideals?

415
01:16:42,323 --> 01:16:44,314
You told him of our revolution?

416
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:48,117
If he gets the police, you didn't
think what will happen to us?

417
01:17:02,476 --> 01:17:05,843
- Go from here.
- No. I've come to your father...

418
01:17:05,879 --> 01:17:09,246
For what? What do you want?
Why have you come?

419
01:17:16,957 --> 01:17:23,863
To tell you whatever she told me,
will not be revealed. Believe me.

420
01:17:24,064 --> 01:17:26,726
It's impossible
to trust those,

421
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,702
...who've sold themselves
and their souls!

422
01:17:29,837 --> 01:17:33,398
I'm here before you,
and my soul's with me too!

423
01:17:33,574 --> 01:17:35,508
Yes, I can see that!

424
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:38,044
No, you're not!

425
01:17:40,314 --> 01:17:42,976
Now I am. So tell me.

426
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:48,856
I wanted to say that I respect
your ideals and patriotism.

427
01:17:48,856 --> 01:17:52,693
I don't want to argue, but if
you try and meet her again...

428
01:17:52,693 --> 01:17:55,321
You'll kill me? Go ahead.

429
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,624
But till my end,
I'll always say...

430
01:17:58,065 --> 01:18:01,432
...that I love Rajjo and
wish to wed her!

431
01:18:01,535 --> 01:18:04,060
You fool! When the country's resoun
-ding with the cry of ''Quit India''..

432
01:18:04,104 --> 01:18:06,868
...you fret over
Love and romance?

433
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:11,504
- Love is not a sin!
- Yes it is! It is a sin.

434
01:18:12,045 --> 01:18:16,311
A man who's not a patriot, can love
nobody on earth! It's all humbug!

435
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:19,384
That's unfair, sir.
Your love for...

436
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,650
...your nation is great!
And our's is nothing?

437
01:18:22,189 --> 01:18:25,955
When I can understand your patriotism
try to understand my love too.

438
01:18:27,761 --> 01:18:29,854
I know I'm my father's son.

439
01:18:30,264 --> 01:18:33,700
I also know she can't come
into my world.

440
01:18:35,035 --> 01:18:38,971
But I can leave that world
and come into yours, sir.

441
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:43,268
I'll leave that house, wealth,
money...everything, sir.

442
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:50,115
I'll leave it all. But she's mine.
You cannot separate us.

443
01:18:53,754 --> 01:18:58,157
I'll come tomorrow morning. After
having taken my Mom's blessings.

444
01:18:58,926 --> 01:19:01,258
I'll come and seek yours.

445
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:30,216
Why are you sitting here alone?

446
01:19:34,862 --> 01:19:37,797
You seem upset.
What is it?

447
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:45,237
I'm leaving home, mom.

448
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:46,631
What!

449
01:20:01,488 --> 01:20:04,013
Bring your girl here.

450
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:09,052
Don't be afraid, son.
I'll convince your father.

451
01:20:10,697 --> 01:20:17,398
I've never asked anything of him.
But for you, I'll do so today.

452
01:20:19,006 --> 01:20:21,998
He won't be able to refuse.
Bring her here.

453
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:26,105
She'll never agree.
I can't bring her here.

454
01:20:27,915 --> 01:20:29,849
But why not?

455
01:20:30,918 --> 01:20:33,487
She's a daughter of
a revolutionary.

456
01:20:33,487 --> 01:20:36,456
Her brother laid down
his life for the country.

457
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:40,218
Dad will never accept her.

458
01:20:49,703 --> 01:20:52,139
I've hurt you very much,
haven't I?

459
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:55,233
No, my dear. It's I who
has hurt you all.

460
01:20:55,842 --> 01:20:58,504
It's always been ''I'',
''mine'', ''my ideals''.

461
01:21:00,013 --> 01:21:03,005
The English didn't kill my son.
I did!

462
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:09,049
I only taught him about patriotism.
About dying for the country.

463
01:21:09,523 --> 01:21:12,960
But he became a martyr...
Did you say...

464
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,724
Yes.
That don't cry for martyrs.

465
01:21:16,797 --> 01:21:19,925
Your Mother.
I killed her too.

466
01:21:20,267 --> 01:21:22,531
Bearing the load of life,
and awaiting me for hours...

467
01:21:22,569 --> 01:21:24,537
...her eyes turned to stone.

468
01:21:26,873 --> 01:21:31,333
My dear, because of me,
I don't want your life...

469
01:21:31,545 --> 01:21:34,810
You have a full right
to lead your life.

470
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,843
My life is with you

471
01:21:38,285 --> 01:21:42,016
Had you told me before, I'd not
have even looked at Nandu.

472
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:44,922
Let alone love him!

473
01:21:45,325 --> 01:21:48,726
But now you do, don't you?

474
01:21:48,762 --> 01:21:50,821
Don't think me weak.

475
01:21:51,932 --> 01:21:54,196
I'm your daughter.

476
01:21:55,335 --> 01:21:57,599
- Will you forget him?
- Yes.

477
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:02,099
Absolutely!
I'll never even give him a thought.

478
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:05,612
If he comes, I'll say I've
nothing to do with him.

479
01:22:05,612 --> 01:22:08,547
Why should he be after me?
There are plenty of girls around.

480
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,343
- I'll forget everything.
- But he loves you.

481
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:14,016
Wants to marry you.

482
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,388
But I don't wish it.
Honestly, I don't.

483
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:22,793
Look at me and tell me that.

484
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:29,427
He's a good boy. He's willing to
discard everything for you.

485
01:22:30,303 --> 01:22:33,466
If you refuse him,
I won't like it.

486
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:41,877
You're very nice...
Too good!

487
01:22:51,992 --> 01:22:54,153
You're going, son? Go.

488
01:22:54,227 --> 01:22:57,822
I won't stop you. Once you marry,
all will be well.

489
01:22:58,331 --> 01:22:59,889
Take this.

490
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:04,198
My blessings to her.

491
01:23:05,372 --> 01:23:08,273
I'll take this to her. But give
her your blessings yourself.

492
01:23:09,076 --> 01:23:13,479
I'll come in the night, with her.
Don't sleep. Await us.

493
01:23:13,814 --> 01:23:15,042
May I go now?

494
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:23,282
I'm His Exxcellency speaking.
I wish to talk to the Major.

495
01:23:23,857 --> 01:23:26,485
- No! What are you doing?
- Get aside!

496
01:24:56,416 --> 01:25:01,319
Run, my dear! Run!
He has got the soldiers.

497
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,355
No!

498
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:22,804
Soldiers!

499
01:25:38,558 --> 01:25:40,719
Run! ...Just run!

500
01:26:04,384 --> 01:26:08,115
Give this to Shubhankar and
ask him not to give up!

501
01:26:08,722 --> 01:26:11,213
I'll follow you later.

502
01:26:11,658 --> 01:26:13,785
Don't argue!
Time's running out.

503
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,900
I want to go to my father.

504
01:29:50,481 --> 01:29:52,949
I want to go to him.

505
01:29:55,519 --> 01:29:57,111
I should go back.

506
01:29:59,690 --> 01:30:02,716
- What's back there?
- Father's there. I must go back.

507
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,896
- You can't go back there.
- I must go back!

508
01:30:05,896 --> 01:30:09,059
- Be sensible! He's not there.
- Then where is he?

509
01:30:09,099 --> 01:30:11,727
- He's a martyr now!
- You're lying!

510
01:30:13,237 --> 01:30:15,899
He can't leave me alone and go!

511
01:30:16,573 --> 01:30:20,168
He's alive.
He can't be dead!

512
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:32,384
I can understand how you feel.

513
01:30:33,023 --> 01:30:35,856
I too have lost my father.

514
01:30:35,893 --> 01:30:39,989
But his death had hung
my head in shame!

515
01:30:41,665 --> 01:30:46,602
I saw that traitor dying a death
of a coward, in public!

516
01:30:47,204 --> 01:30:50,731
Your father stood by me then.

517
01:30:51,442 --> 01:30:55,970
He taught me the meaning of
self-respect and patriotism.

518
01:30:56,213 --> 01:31:02,448
Today I'm proud!
For he became a martyr.

519
01:31:03,654 --> 01:31:07,351
And one doesn't shed tears
for martyrs!

520
01:31:21,738 --> 01:31:23,205
Remember?

521
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:28,603
What your father had said,
when Douglas hung his son?

522
01:31:31,081 --> 01:31:32,571
I remember.

523
01:32:16,593 --> 01:32:19,460
What have you done to my son?

524
01:32:23,367 --> 01:32:27,701
But I'm not sad by your death.

525
01:32:28,372 --> 01:32:32,069
You died for your country.

526
01:32:39,349 --> 01:32:41,977
Don't cry, my dear.

527
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:47,818
It's an insult to them.

528
01:32:50,761 --> 01:32:53,821
Promise me, that you'll never cry.

529
01:32:54,932 --> 01:32:56,763
Go on, promise me.

530
01:33:16,887 --> 01:33:18,787
I promise.

531
01:33:20,357 --> 01:33:22,587
I'll never cry again.

532
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:27,924
Dad had said...

533
01:33:29,233 --> 01:33:31,599
As long as we
both are alive...

534
01:33:32,603 --> 01:33:35,003
...Shubhankar is not alone.

535
01:33:35,472 --> 01:33:39,533
I'm still alive.
So, you're not alone.

536
01:33:41,578 --> 01:33:46,379
Together, we'll both flutter
the Tricolour of father's dream!

537
01:33:47,818 --> 01:33:51,481
Yes! You and I.

538
01:33:52,689 --> 01:33:55,590
We'll flutter the tri-colour
of his dreams!

539
01:33:58,862 --> 01:34:00,887
Do you remember that song?

540
01:34:01,765 --> 01:34:06,930
Which father, my brother,
you and I...

541
01:34:07,838 --> 01:34:10,204
All sang together?

542
01:38:31,434 --> 01:38:33,231
How do you feel now, son?

543
01:38:39,442 --> 01:38:42,343
Where is Rajjo?

544
01:38:42,445 --> 01:38:46,074
Everything will be fine.

545
01:38:48,919 --> 01:38:52,548
Not ''will be''. I've seen to it,
that all ''is fine'' !

546
01:38:53,957 --> 01:38:58,394
To trap the boys of the rich, these
people ''use'' their daughters!

547
01:38:58,862 --> 01:39:02,059
But we can straighten
such lowly rats too.

548
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:07,365
My phone pleased the English.
My son was saved.

549
01:39:07,938 --> 01:39:11,738
And that man and his daughter
were blown to bits!

550
01:39:19,416 --> 01:39:20,644
Yes, Major?

551
01:39:22,218 --> 01:39:24,948
What!
I've been made a Lord?

552
01:39:29,326 --> 01:39:33,126
It was my life-long dream
to get this title.

553
01:39:33,163 --> 01:39:36,326
I wanted that at any cost!

554
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,802
Celebration? Ofcourse.

555
01:39:41,237 --> 01:39:44,400
I'll have such a grand affair that
this town will never forget it!

556
01:39:45,475 --> 01:39:50,003
Yes! I'm just awaiting
the General now.

557
01:40:04,961 --> 01:40:07,521
If you go,
do you think I'll stay?

558
01:40:07,864 --> 01:40:11,322
Your father employed my father.
Not me! I'm here because of you.

559
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:13,931
If you stay, I stay.
If not, I go too.

560
01:40:14,838 --> 01:40:16,999
No!
You won't leave that house.

561
01:40:17,374 --> 01:40:21,572
My mother will be lonely
without me.

562
01:40:23,313 --> 01:40:27,977
You'll stay there, for her sake.
Promise me.

563
01:40:30,954 --> 01:40:33,889
Okay, I promise.
For her sake.

564
01:40:35,158 --> 01:40:37,183
- Bye, then.
- Where are you going?

565
01:40:37,227 --> 01:40:41,755
- To find Rajjo.
- But when that bomb exxploded...

566
01:40:41,798 --> 01:40:46,701
Atleast you don't say that.
She's alive. My heart tells me.

567
01:40:48,038 --> 01:40:49,665
Okay. Sit down.

568
01:40:51,708 --> 01:40:54,336
Your heart is right ofcourse.

569
01:40:54,778 --> 01:40:58,737
You had vowed to live and die
together. How can she die alone?

570
01:40:59,382 --> 01:41:02,351
I'll have my meal and then we'll
both go in search of her.

571
01:41:03,253 --> 01:41:06,156
It's a tiny town. Nobody can
get lost, even wishing to!

572
01:41:06,156 --> 01:41:07,783
Okay? We'll find her.

573
01:41:56,806 --> 01:42:01,243
Where are the bombs hidden?
And who all are with you?

574
01:42:01,678 --> 01:42:03,145
I won't tell you.

575
01:42:12,188 --> 01:42:15,521
Traitor! Because of you,
my son left our home!

576
01:42:15,759 --> 01:42:20,287
You've served me for years
and now you do treason with me?

577
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:23,631
Tell us, where those traitors are!

578
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:29,099
You may be knowing traitors;
I know only patriots!

579
01:42:29,305 --> 01:42:32,375
You traitor! I'll kill you.

580
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:36,607
We don't want corpses,
but information!

581
01:42:45,922 --> 01:42:48,584
Don't cry.
Nothing will happen.

582
01:42:49,058 --> 01:42:52,892
- I'm scared. They'll kill him.
- Nothing will happen, I know.

583
01:42:52,996 --> 01:42:54,224
Here comes His Exxcellency.

584
01:42:56,199 --> 01:42:59,191
My husband's innocent.
He has done nothing.

585
01:42:59,235 --> 01:43:03,763
Release him. He's innocent.
We've served you all our lives.

586
01:43:04,307 --> 01:43:06,832
Only you can save him, sir.

587
01:43:08,711 --> 01:43:12,238
Only you can save, sir.

588
01:43:13,449 --> 01:43:15,781
Tell him, Munna.

589
01:43:15,919 --> 01:43:20,481
Sir, he's innocent.

590
01:43:21,124 --> 01:43:23,183
Let's go, driver.

591
01:43:50,019 --> 01:43:53,420
Why are you following me?
Want to send soldiers here too?

592
01:43:53,489 --> 01:43:57,721
Don't say that, Mr Baig.
My father sent those soldiers.

593
01:43:58,194 --> 01:44:00,128
I want to find Rajjo.

594
01:44:00,163 --> 01:44:03,621
She too will think,
I'm her father's killer.

595
01:44:04,167 --> 01:44:07,000
Just let me meet her once.

596
01:44:08,338 --> 01:44:12,707
They are beating Govind brutally.
His wife is unconscious on the road.

597
01:44:12,976 --> 01:44:15,911
Come inside; Quick.
Take this.

598
01:44:17,847 --> 01:44:23,615
How many more will you kill? Rajjo
is out of your life. She's dead.

599
01:44:31,928 --> 01:44:35,989
Ten days!

600
01:44:36,966 --> 01:44:41,767
Because of the bomb-blast,
Douglas will be here 1 0 days later.

601
01:44:42,605 --> 01:44:45,438
I'll have to wait for
another 1 0 days.

602
01:44:46,609 --> 01:44:49,578
The town must be
surrounded by soldiers.

603
01:44:49,612 --> 01:44:52,979
But your father's efforts
will not go waste.

604
01:44:54,684 --> 01:44:58,552
I'll get Douglas before
he enters the town.

605
01:45:04,627 --> 01:45:06,458
You're not alone in this.

606
01:45:07,931 --> 01:45:09,762
I'll be with you.

607
01:45:11,734 --> 01:45:15,363
I know you'll always
be with me.

608
01:45:16,205 --> 01:45:19,265
But, I'll have to await
that day...

609
01:45:20,076 --> 01:45:23,045
...when the Tri-colour
flutters in this country.

610
01:45:23,713 --> 01:45:28,912
Our dream will come true.
And this earth will be ours!

611
01:45:29,719 --> 01:45:34,019
And in a small part of it,
we'll have a small house.

612
01:45:38,161 --> 01:45:41,892
Just that Mr. Baig will leave the
bag with the bomb in a shop.

613
01:45:42,565 --> 01:45:47,468
You'll bring it to the bus-station
and meet me. Be careful.

614
01:45:47,537 --> 01:45:49,505
There'll be many soldiers there.

615
01:45:50,373 --> 01:45:52,671
Don't worry about me.

616
01:45:56,379 --> 01:45:58,609
Nobody will recognise me.

617
01:46:04,754 --> 01:46:07,245
I'm dead to them anyway.

618
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,772
Wait Rajjo. Wait.

619
01:50:48,671 --> 01:50:50,605
Catch him!
Let him not escape.

620
01:50:51,641 --> 01:50:53,836
You're alright, aren't you?

621
01:51:00,249 --> 01:51:01,614
Stop!

622
01:51:02,451 --> 01:51:05,716
Get down, all of you.

623
01:51:06,589 --> 01:51:08,386
You go ahead.

624
01:51:17,933 --> 01:51:20,458
Out!
Get down one by one.

625
01:51:25,608 --> 01:51:28,600
Get along.
Hurry up!

626
01:51:37,687 --> 01:51:40,212
- We've surrounded the place.
- Anybody saw him?

627
01:51:40,456 --> 01:51:42,686
No, sir. But he's somewhere
here. Can't escape.

628
01:51:42,725 --> 01:51:47,458
I've seen him and
I can identify him too.

629
01:51:49,432 --> 01:51:51,957
- Open this bo xx.
- I don't have the key.

630
01:52:03,846 --> 01:52:06,906
This one? Is he the one?

631
01:52:44,653 --> 01:52:48,282
- Yes or no?
- No!

632
01:52:51,794 --> 01:52:53,455
Look again.

633
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:58,762
No. It's not him.

634
01:53:02,538 --> 01:53:05,598
- What's in that?
- Tool-bo xx.

635
01:53:06,041 --> 01:53:08,771
- Open it and show.
- Okay...

636
01:53:10,379 --> 01:53:12,506
- Stop!
- Run, Shankar

637
01:53:36,005 --> 01:53:38,303
The Major wants you. Hurry!

638
01:53:41,644 --> 01:53:43,441
Lock him up!

639
01:53:50,453 --> 01:53:51,818
Is this that man?

640
01:53:53,522 --> 01:53:56,423
Yes. That's him.

641
01:54:02,965 --> 01:54:08,835
The General will be here soon.
Get those blood-stains washed.

642
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:21,181
It took so much time.
So many died.

643
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:25,151
And we lost everything
in one moment.

644
01:54:26,188 --> 01:54:28,850
Now we neither have a bomb,
not a pistol.

645
01:54:29,692 --> 01:54:33,719
Suddenly, I am very tired.

646
01:54:36,732 --> 01:54:40,065
Who was following you?

647
01:54:45,174 --> 01:54:46,505
Who's he?

648
01:55:04,126 --> 01:55:06,492
You lied about Rajjo's death.

649
01:55:07,229 --> 01:55:11,666
Nobody can take her from me.
She's mine, sir.

650
01:55:11,734 --> 01:55:14,897
- A man who got her father killed...
- That's a lie!

651
01:55:15,504 --> 01:55:18,598
My father sent the soldiers. Not me.
How many times must I tell you that?

652
01:55:20,543 --> 01:55:24,775
I didn't go there to betray him,
but to ask for his daughter's hand.

653
01:55:25,247 --> 01:55:30,913
To tell him that I was willing to
leave my world, and join him.

654
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:35,017
I had told him that I was going
home, only to seek Mom's blessing.

655
01:55:35,391 --> 01:55:38,849
She not only blessed me,
but gave ''sindoor'' for Rajjo!

656
01:55:39,328 --> 01:55:44,095
I'd have put it in her hair-parting
and we'd have been married.

657
01:55:45,467 --> 01:55:50,564
If not physically, emotionally
we are husband and wife.

658
01:56:48,764 --> 01:56:52,700
British; Quit India.

659
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:40,580
He's innocent, sir.

660
01:57:41,283 --> 01:57:46,846
Release him!
He has done nothing.

661
01:57:47,423 --> 01:57:50,187
He's innocent, sir.

662
01:58:12,014 --> 01:58:16,713
If I had it my way,
I'd kill you.

663
01:59:28,223 --> 01:59:32,216
I'm not a coward.
I spat on him.

664
01:59:32,761 --> 01:59:37,061
- I'm not a coward.
- No, you're not.

665
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:14,130
You're not eating anything?

666
02:00:14,303 --> 02:00:19,240
After what happened today,
can anyone feel hungry and eat?

667
02:00:21,109 --> 02:00:25,409
Those who break laws, have
to face the punishment.

668
02:00:26,148 --> 02:00:29,879
Is asking for ''Independence''
a crime?

669
02:00:29,985 --> 02:00:35,048
Is that General a God
to kill as he pleases?

670
02:00:35,524 --> 02:00:41,292
- And you?
- Look, I'm an Army officer.

671
02:00:41,864 --> 02:00:44,890
It's my duty to carry out
orders loyally.

672
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:48,162
If it's your duty to
shoot the unarmed...

673
02:00:48,704 --> 02:00:51,434
...then tomorrow,
I'll do my duty too.

674
02:00:51,907 --> 02:00:55,138
- Duty as an Indian.
- What?

675
02:00:55,544 --> 02:00:58,206
I'll do what the patriots do.

676
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:04,983
When they'll cremate Govind and
Munna, I'll be among them too.

677
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:09,582
You'll do nothing of the sort!
What do you know of these traitors?

678
02:01:10,125 --> 02:01:13,094
And all those
rehearsals you did.

679
02:01:13,528 --> 02:01:16,258
They were just a facade
to pull wool over our eyes.

680
02:01:16,565 --> 02:01:19,557
They were meant to
assassinate the General.

681
02:01:20,068 --> 02:01:22,468
And do you know
who was behind it?

682
02:01:24,439 --> 02:01:28,102
My own friend, Mr Baig.

683
02:01:59,274 --> 02:02:01,174
Shankar has told us everything.

684
02:02:06,014 --> 02:02:09,074
Then go and call Mr Baig.

685
02:02:12,821 --> 02:02:16,780
We all have to die one day.

686
02:02:17,059 --> 02:02:20,153
But what you're doing
is suicide.

687
02:02:20,662 --> 02:02:24,826
Think again calmly.

688
02:02:25,734 --> 02:02:29,534
You'll never get near him
with this knife.

689
02:02:30,005 --> 02:02:32,439
You won't even get
to touch him.

690
02:02:35,410 --> 02:02:38,208
Your life belongs
to the whole nation,

691
02:02:39,081 --> 02:02:42,141
You can't afford
to throw it away.

692
02:02:48,790 --> 02:02:50,189
I'll see.

693
02:02:57,432 --> 02:02:59,662
We've a warrant for your arrest.

694
02:03:00,202 --> 02:03:01,794
What's my crime?

695
02:03:04,539 --> 02:03:06,837
That, he'll tell.

696
02:03:10,846 --> 02:03:15,874
Forgive me, sir.
They beat me mercilessly.

697
02:03:17,652 --> 02:03:19,643
Where's Shubhankar?

698
02:03:21,056 --> 02:03:24,025
- You told everything?
- Where is he?

699
02:03:57,192 --> 02:03:59,786
- How do we leave town?
- We'll have to cross Town Square.

700
02:03:59,828 --> 02:04:02,820
- We'll travel all night...
- And reach there at dawn.

701
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:05,758
As long as Douglas is here,
I'll stay put.

702
02:04:09,938 --> 02:04:12,338
Put the Holy Water
in his mouth.

703
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:25,815
The name of the deceased,
and your own name.

704
02:04:26,988 --> 02:04:30,185
Keep this rice on his chest.

705
02:04:33,328 --> 02:04:35,626
Mr Baig's life is in peril.

706
02:05:04,659 --> 02:05:09,221
The major's watching. Don't stop.
Listen to me carefully.

707
02:05:12,601 --> 02:05:16,332
You two carry on. He's an old friend.
Nothing will happen to me.

708
02:05:16,371 --> 02:05:18,066
Stop, Mr Baig.

709
02:05:18,140 --> 02:05:22,577
Your aim is the General.
He should not escape.

710
02:05:22,644 --> 02:05:25,670
Who's with you?
Stop them.

711
02:05:25,714 --> 02:05:30,208
Don't force me to shoot.
Stop, I say.

712
02:05:46,668 --> 02:05:49,603
How will he kill the General?

713
02:05:50,338 --> 02:05:54,502
He has neither a bomb,
nor a pistol.

714
02:06:00,081 --> 02:06:04,313
He must be having a gun, sir.
He must!

715
02:06:55,437 --> 02:06:59,840
We're leading a shameful life;
That of slaves.

716
02:06:59,908 --> 02:07:02,706
You live with a head held high;
Take this.

717
02:07:09,751 --> 02:07:12,219
Bless you, son.

718
02:07:13,989 --> 02:07:16,116
I've to give you something too.

719
02:07:17,826 --> 02:07:19,487
Rajjo is alive.

720
02:07:20,328 --> 02:07:23,422
If you meet her, tell her
I didn't betray her.

721
02:07:23,465 --> 02:07:25,194
I'm not a traitor
to my country.

722
02:07:35,043 --> 02:07:39,002
You'll leave this house again,
over my dead body!

723
02:07:40,649 --> 02:07:44,483
If that's what you,
so be it.

724
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:49,017
We've been living according
to your wishes, anyway.

725
02:07:50,992 --> 02:07:55,827
You got Mr Pathak killed.
I saw him blown to smithereens.

726
02:07:56,698 --> 02:07:59,826
I kept quiet, as your son.

727
02:08:00,735 --> 02:08:05,468
I lost Rajjo, and my
life's love with her.

728
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:09,772
I kept quiet,
as I was your son.

729
02:08:10,779 --> 02:08:12,872
But today, it
concerns the General.

730
02:08:13,481 --> 02:08:19,147
Our independence. The whole nation.
I won't keep silent today, father.

731
02:08:19,454 --> 02:08:22,252
- Stop him!
- You need to be stopped!

732
02:08:22,724 --> 02:08:26,216
- Else, we'll be slaves to ourselves.
- So, you'll stop me, eh?

733
02:08:26,795 --> 02:08:30,993
Yes. I'll stop you!
Remember?

734
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:34,864
You had lifted the phone
the last time I had left?

735
02:08:35,403 --> 02:08:39,840
But today...now...
You'll have to decide.

736
02:08:40,375 --> 02:08:43,902
Who's side you're on.
Ours, or the English?

737
02:08:44,512 --> 02:08:48,573
If you're on their side,
I'll have to go over your corpse.

738
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:51,614
- Make him see sense.
- I swear by my mother.

739
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:57,158
If you betray your nation again,
I'll kill you. Who are you with?

740
02:08:57,625 --> 02:09:01,823
With us, or with the English?

741
02:09:02,564 --> 02:09:07,001
- I'm with you, son.
- Then say, ''Long Live India'' !

742
02:09:08,436 --> 02:09:12,270
- Say it!
- Long Live India, son.

743
02:09:43,104 --> 02:09:44,901
I'm going.

744
02:09:47,075 --> 02:09:48,872
I won't cry.

745
02:09:50,078 --> 02:09:54,378
Dad had said, one does not insult
the martyrs by weeping.

746
02:10:00,588 --> 02:10:02,818
Look after yourself.

747
02:11:20,168 --> 02:11:25,606
My pistol's been stolen.
My son had come last night.

748
02:12:34,809 --> 02:12:36,970
I'm ashamed to call you my son!

749
02:12:38,212 --> 02:12:39,702
Who else is with you?

750
02:12:41,749 --> 02:12:43,649
The whole nation!

751
02:12:51,759 --> 02:12:59,131
The whole nation!
''Long Live India'' !

752
02:13:16,351 --> 02:13:17,978
Indeed!

753
02:15:50,004 --> 02:15:55,601
Empty the square!
No man should be seen.

754
02:15:56,144 --> 02:15:59,511
Remove every man.
Hurry up!

755
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:09,950
Dangle it down!

756
02:16:34,015 --> 02:16:39,043
Forgive me, Mother.
I couldn't do anything for you.

757
02:16:40,955 --> 02:16:43,583
You're sacrificing your life
for your Motherland.

758
02:16:44,559 --> 02:16:48,222
What more can you
do for me?

759
02:16:52,033 --> 02:16:53,933
Go, son.

760
02:16:58,973 --> 02:17:02,033
Long Live India!

761
02:19:22,883 --> 02:19:25,113
The General will pardon you.

762
02:19:25,186 --> 02:19:28,019
Tell him about the traitors
and save your own skin.

763
02:19:28,189 --> 02:19:33,183
I know but one traitor;
And that's you, father.

764
02:20:08,396 --> 02:20:11,490
''Long Live India''

765
02:21:25,606 --> 02:21:29,667
Call the water-carrier
and clean the blood-stains.

766
02:22:38,445 --> 02:22:40,606
Where's that water-boy?

767
02:22:41,348 --> 02:22:43,282
He's there somewhere.

768
02:22:53,661 --> 02:22:56,027
Come on, hurry up.

769
02:24:27,855 --> 02:24:33,521
Don't be afraid
of their bullets.

770
02:25:24,411 --> 02:25:26,714
Stop them, Papa.

771
02:25:26,714 --> 02:25:29,512
They are shooting their own.

772
02:25:31,051 --> 02:25:32,985
Stop them.

773
02:26:04,685 --> 02:26:06,812
Don't run away! Stop!

774
02:26:07,354 --> 02:26:12,621
Stop! They can't do anything!
Come back!

775
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:15,485
Come back! Come back!

776
02:26:39,219 --> 02:26:44,088
Stop! Stop!
Don't run away!

777
02:26:52,733 --> 02:26:54,963
Forgive me, my dear.

778
02:26:55,636 --> 02:26:58,230
You didn't do anything.

779
02:26:59,773 --> 02:27:02,298
You just did your duty.

780
02:27:19,226 --> 02:27:22,389
If firing at unarmed men
is your duty...

781
02:27:22,930 --> 02:27:27,833
...then I too shall do my duty.
Duty of every Indian.

782
02:27:43,183 --> 02:27:45,811
Long Live India!

783
02:27:48,455 --> 02:27:52,050
''India Forever''

784
02:35:49,336 --> 02:35:52,794
The National Army
will now salute.

785
02:35:53,673 --> 02:35:56,403
Everybody salute.

786
02:36:07,187 --> 02:36:08,916
Long Live India!

787
02:36:12,292 --> 02:36:15,625
Praise the Over-Lord of the
people and their minds.

788
02:36:15,929 --> 02:36:18,830
The Maker of India's fortune.

789
02:36:19,165 --> 02:36:25,570
India, with her various states in
the North, South, East and West...

790
02:36:26,840 --> 02:36:30,640
...with her great mountain-ranges
and Holy rivers...

791
02:36:30,944 --> 02:36:33,879
And turbulent waves
of the Seas around her...

792
02:36:34,748 --> 02:36:41,654
Sings praises to your good-name;
Seeks your blessings.

793
02:36:42,155 --> 02:36:45,386
And recites your pious tale.

794
02:36:45,859 --> 02:36:49,488
O, Over-lord of the people
and their minds...

795
02:36:49,529 --> 02:36:58,494
And the Maker of India's fortune,
Praise to Thee.

796
02:36:59,105 --> 02:37:02,541
Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!
