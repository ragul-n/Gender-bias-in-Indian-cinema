1
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,330
this palatial house has been
decorated to celebrate,...

2
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,669
the birthday of mr anup,
the grandson of mr ashok mehra.

3
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,350
today as he"ll be selecting
his life partner,...

4
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:36,352
this house is replete
with a bevy of beauties.

5
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,899
her white attire is very
misleading.

6
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,874
she thinks she"s a beauty queen.
her shamelessness is appalling.

7
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,547
her mother is an alcoholic, father
a smuggler and brother a con man.

8
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,886
she herself is not any less.

9
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:15,717
she thinks she has an
hour glass figure.

10
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,391
that wretch thinks
she can trap my anup.

11
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,418
l"m very happy to be invited
for your birthday bash.

12
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:45,754
everyone is so hopeful
and spiteful too.

13
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,761
actually, he is thrilled.

14
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,430
now hurry up and announce
your choice.

15
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,770
l"ll be very patient.

16
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,467
l love you very much.

17
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,807
y ou are special to me.

18
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,479
did your father lose his job?
no.

19
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,477
suffered a loss in business?
no.

20
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,819
any other losses?
no.

21
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,649
then can"t he afford enough material
to cover you up decently?

22
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,823
anup, don"t torture me
further.

23
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,832
what do you surmise?
y ou"ll soon know.

24
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:10,498
y ou"ll make a good wife.
my first husband will testify that.

25
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:14,506
that won"t be,...
sorry to disturb you.

26
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:20,511
but there"s a call for you
from the boss from shimla.

27
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,919
lt must be a trunk call.
sit in my special chamber.

28
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:24,923
who me?
not you.

29
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:32,898
greetings, grandad

30
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,870
but why did you not come?
l was coming,...

31
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,873
but had to return as
there"s a road block.

32
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,205
there"s a snow fall out here.

33
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,586
l"m sure the party is a success?
y es.

34
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,883
but l"m missing you.

35
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,891
ls it sophia loren?
who was that?

36
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,551
are you there?
that was the t.v.

37
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,559
now think in terms of
getting married.

38
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,899
y ou ought to be with your
wife by your next birthday.

39
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,905
as you please.

40
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,980
nanny, grandad had called up to
wish me on my birthday.

41
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,585
and he won"t be coming as
there is a road block.

42
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,589
sir, look at all this

43
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:35,586
who is she?

44
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,924
look, take care of my car.

45
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,307
a poet"s ballad
what?

46
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,368
a poem
what?

47
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:09,978
l am princess sapna.

48
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,326
l see you in my dreams.
what?

49
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:20,988
l know you very well.
are you from my estate ramnagar?

50
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,334
no.

51
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,403
can you spare a minute for me?
why?

52
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:32,002
l want to talk to you.
then a minute is less for that.

53
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:38,415
so be patient.
l"m been patient since long.

54
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,013
l have to go to the
jailers" shop to buy a locket.

55
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,019
take my heart instead of
the locket.

56
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,401
y ou are very,...

57
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,039
my name is anupam.

58
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,409
lt means handsome.

59
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,373
then you can become
someone"s dream boy?

60
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:17,386
but nobody"s interested.
excuse me.

61
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,417
mr madan, l won"t be able to
meet you today.

62
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,087
mr anup, the foreign buyers
are waiting for you.

63
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,326
they are leaving today itself
and want to finalise the partnership.

64
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,091
today l"ve found my
life partner.

65
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,502
he refused to bite
the bait.

66
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,441
prem ditched us.

67
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,618
do you recognise the master?
y es, but who are you?

68
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:26,455
l"m his madam, he"s in the jewelers"
shop. bring the keys from him.

69
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,470
are you mr anup?
what is the matter?

70
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,143
madam wants the car keys.
which madam?

71
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,138
y our madam?

72
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,162
hey, stop

73
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,179
sir, my money?

74
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:33,522
y ou very nearly killed me.

75
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,520
do you remember me?
perhaps.

76
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:40,194
people often come here
repeatedly.

77
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,194
my heart is still racing.

78
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,703
lf you are feeling better,
l"d like to talk to you.

79
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,604
okay.
l"d bought a painting from you.

80
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:55,545

are my clients.

81
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,207
come, l"ll show you a
nice painting.

82
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:08,217
lt is very true to life.

83
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,221
let me speak.

84
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,228
but you are not saying anything.
y ou never gave me a chance to.

85
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,228
do you remember that l"d
bought a girl"s painting?

86
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:23,567
y ou"d said that she"s a dream girl.
l"m ignorant of your dreams.

87
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,575
y ou"d asked for rs 100 but
l"d paid you rs 200.

88
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:33,646
l"ll pay you rs 100 but please
give me that girl"s address.

89
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:41,593
how was she?
she was beautiful with big eyes.

90
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,587
she had long tresses and looked
like a princess.

91
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,929
l know her.
who is she?

92
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,605
a girl.
where does she stay?

93
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,668
l don"t know that.

94
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:09,278
atleast tell me who gave
you that painting?

95
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,283
a crippled boy gave me
that painting.

96
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:26,294
chintu, this is the first time you
are making my painting so be careful.

97
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:34,302
lt should look real.
don"t worry.

98
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,647
lt better.

99
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,651
uncle, don"t let the
dog move.

100
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,323
lt"ll be a worthy
painting. smile

101
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,321
my jaws are paining with
the effort of smiling.

102
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,735
lt"s almost done only the
tail is remaining.

103
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,738
what?
l mean your moustache.

104
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,345
neither do l have a tail
nor a moustache.

105
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,681
let me see what you"ve
been doing for so long.

106
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:19,346
y ou tricked me.

107
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,690
y es, because then the dog
wouldn"t have sat still.

108
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:28,355
that"s your problem.
y ou find the dog more beautiful?

109
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,861
now no milk for you.

110
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,362
why are you both quarreling?
he made me sit to paint the dog.

111
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:42,711
ls it? chintu, why didn"t you
paint an ass instead?

112
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,713
what?
l"ll do it now.

113
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,379
children, come and see what
l"ve brought for you.

114
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,391

00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,397

119
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,741

00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,751
sister, open the bag.

122
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,424
he"ll take a long time
to come.

123
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,087
sister, please.
what did you bring for me?

124
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:37,758
y ou are still not dressed?

125
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:45,774
l got this bag for you.
now go.

126
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:49,779
this is for you.

127
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,444
this is for padmini and
this is for ramesh.

128
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,788
this is for sita and
this is for badri.

129
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,854
this is for you and this
is for alankar.

130
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,800
raju, these chocolates are for you
but share it with everyone.

131
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,462
give it to me.
l won"t.

132
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,999
stop fighting.
good children never fight.

133
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,813
l don"t have a tooth brush.
what?

134
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,643
l don"t have a tooth brush.
but l"d got you one.

135
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:31,855
raju polished his shoes with it.
raju, is this true?

136
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,487
l didn"t use his tooth brush.
then whose tooth brush did you use?

137
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,494
y ours.
what?

138
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,833
y ou used her tooth brush to
polish your shoes

139
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:55,503
fool
l"m glad that he did not lie.

140
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,850
moti, you"ll get your tooth brush.
chintu, here"s your painting material.

141
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:17,530
l can"t live without him.
l"m helpless, rupa.

142
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:23,940
every parent wants to be with their
child but we"re forced to do otherwise.

143
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,877
we"ll take him back
when the time is ripe.

144
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,723
bring him.
shall l bring him?

145
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,889
none but she herself
will go.

146
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,558
come on, start counting.

147
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,905
sister, let me carry.
no, l want to hold him.

148
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:03,570
lt is a cute child.
chandu, keep this locket securely.

149
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,585
what will we christen it?
we"ll call her guddi.

150
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,248
y eah, it"s a nice name.

151
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,925
she"s peed and ruined
my clothes.

152
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,592
we"ll christen her barsati.
that"s such an old name.

153
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:28,995
we"ll call her barkha.
she is a sly fox.

154
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,604
he is a boy not a girl.
but how did you know that?

155
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,607
l know it.
how?

156
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,622
doesn"t he resemble raju?

157
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,012
then we"ll christen him badal.

158
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:15,642
prem, nobody can save
you from us.

159
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:22,994
l waited for your brother anup to
sign on this partnership deal.

160
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,996
but both of you were
absconding.

161
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:32,000
did he not sign?
he must"ve got held up somewhere.

162
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,669
l know your urgent work.

163
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:43,006
but what about our work? we lost
money and the deal too.

164
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,047
have faith in me.
lt"ll be done.

165
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:51,049
l don"t trust you.
swear on this.

166
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:55,682
l assure to return your money and
get the papers signed also.

167
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:02,691
this gun is loaded.

168
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,694
the consignment has been dispatched
to 3 different parties.

169
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:15,068
lf you sign these documents besides
earning illfame you"ll lose rs 8 lakhs.

170
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,073
what are you saying,
accountant?

171
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:26,714
they are financially very sound.
then why do they want to ruin us?

172
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,226
ruin us?

173
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,059
l thought you are paying for
your father"s deeds.

174
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,223
and so l helped you against
grandad"s wishes.

175
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:41,736
but keeping in mind your actions l
feel grandad was lenient with you.

176
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:47,109
l"ve to put up with you as
luck is not favouring me.

177
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,738
though l too have an
equal share.

178
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:57,084
only difference being that you"re his
son"s son and l, his daughter"s son.

179
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,158
prem, don"t ever say anything
against grandad.

cheater friends to cheat me.

182
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:18,765
how was l to know that
they are cheats.

183
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:26,148
l thought l"d start a business with
the money l earn from this deal.

184
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:32,786
l think l"m destined to struggle.

185
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:37,185
wait
accountant, give him rs 20,000.

186
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,791

188
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:54,141
lt was good l met dream girl and was
unable to sign these documents.

00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:31,080
chandu, they seem to be very
rich people.

190
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,490
y eah, they must have got
a fat dowry.

191
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:37,585
then we too must get a share.

192
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,473
stop this marriage.

193
00:31:55,146 --> 00:32:00,106
damn you first settle matters
with us before you marry.

194
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,476
who are you?
didn"t you recognise me?

195
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:11,495
ln your excitement to marry, you
even forgot your son.

196
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,130
did you even forget
your wife?

197
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,137
try to recognise her.

198
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,133
why are you so dazed?

199
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,537
why are you finding
happiness at her cost?

200
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:43,149
son, what is all this?
father, l"m innocent.

201
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:49,557
punish me but have mercy
on this poor child.

202
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,166
but who are you?
ask your son.

203
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,166
he is your grandson.

204
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:03,547
when he can"t deny being your son
how can he deny his own son?

205
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:07,345
father, they are lying.
why should l lie?

206
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,544
this will only malign me.

207
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:16,193

let"s go.

208
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,531

l was to gain a fat dowry
from his marriage.

211
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,582
how was l to know that he"d
father a child without marriage?

212
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:45,613
but father,..
l don"t want to create problems.

213
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:52,219
take care of your child so
l"m free to commit suicide.

214
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:58,224
ln that case, who"ll look
after the child?

215
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:11,244
why are you all so sad at
such a happy occasion?

216
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:15,241

220
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:37,267

00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,640
okay, let"s settle for
rs 10,000.

222
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:44,278

l can"t bear to see this
child"s life being ruined.

229
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,679
he"ll have to marry her and
l"ll give away the girl.

230
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:28,314
why are you taking pains for me?
we"ll go now.

231
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:36,689
hereafter, you"ll always
stay in this house.

232
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,334

251
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:53,919
l"m speaking the truth. l"ll
question the fruit vendor about it.

252
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,530
sir, throw the child as he
is a spirit.

253
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:07,533
l"ve been noticing the change
in your attitude.

254
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,945
l suspected something fishy.

255
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,050
that"s why he refuses to marry.
shut up

256
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,563
there was a child in
the fruit basket.

257
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,933
l sell the finest quality goods.

258
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:34,935
l said a child.
the fruits are always ripe.

259
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:43,570
there was a child.
a child

260
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,577
sir, l sell fruits not
children.

261
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,588
this is all your doing.

262
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,991
quiet
hold him.

263
00:39:56,627 --> 00:40:00,996
l won"t nurture your sin.

264
02:40:39,984 --> 02:40:41,076
l found a child in the
fruit basket.

265
02:40:45,022 --> 02:40:47,582
ls it a bird?
lt"s a human child.

272
03:21:57,161 --> 03:22:03,999
this is a great saint.

273
03:22:06,670 --> 03:22:09,639
who is she?

274
03:22:12,676 --> 03:22:17,978
gods and goddess are
all alike.

275
03:22:18,682 --> 03:22:22,641
there is no difference.
true

276
03:22:26,056 --> 03:22:31,653
there is a child.
that is too good to be true.

277
03:22:32,062 --> 03:22:35,657
what do you mean?
god has come to meet a devil.

278
03:22:36,200 --> 03:22:41,661
stop talking nonsense and
get out of here.

279
03:22:44,041 --> 03:22:49,035
l can curse you and ruin
you for insulting me.

280
03:22:49,713 --> 03:22:55,049
baba, forgive him as he"s
immature.

281
03:22:57,120 --> 03:22:59,680
where have you come from?
they"re pile ons.

282
03:23:01,725 --> 03:23:06,685
l"ve come to pay obeisance to the
lord who"s come to your house.

283
03:23:10,234 --> 03:23:13,032
this child is cursed.
curb your tongue, old woman

284
03:23:16,073 --> 03:23:20,703
l"m sorry.
this is no ordinary child.

285
03:23:21,144 --> 03:23:27,708
lt"s your good fortune that he"s
come here in the fruit basket.

286
03:23:29,086 --> 03:23:32,055
means?
ln the basket of mangoes.

287
03:23:32,122 --> 03:23:36,718
that"s true.
he has a mole on his right foot.

288
03:23:39,763 --> 03:23:42,732
lt does has one mole.
no, there are two moles.

289
03:23:43,100 --> 03:23:46,126
look here.
that"s right.

290
03:23:46,937 --> 03:23:51,738
lt has another symbol too.
look here.

291
03:23:55,779 --> 03:24:00,148
that is right.
this is sheer nonsense.

292
03:24:02,786 --> 03:24:07,746
son, count your blessings that god
has showered his grace on you.

293
03:24:12,796 --> 03:24:18,757
y ou have resemblance to it.
this is a lie.

294
03:24:43,994 --> 03:24:49,455
the slogan of truth, harmony and
beauty is echoing everywhere.

295
03:24:50,200 --> 03:24:55,797
l"ll summon the police and
get you both arrested.

296
03:24:57,007 --> 03:24:58,804
saint, forgive him
as he"s immature.

297
03:25:02,846 --> 03:25:05,314
place the lord here and
sing some hymns.

298
03:25:05,849 --> 03:25:08,977
come.
the lord will be present here.

299
03:25:18,261 --> 03:25:20,821
close your eyes and
meditate.

300
03:25:46,223 --> 03:25:47,850
shut up
ls it the lord talking?

301
03:25:48,325 --> 03:25:50,259
lt is me.
where are they?

302
03:26:01,905 --> 03:26:05,864
taxi, follow them.
and l am following you.

303
03:26:06,309 --> 03:26:08,209
grandad, you and here
y es.

304
03:26:08,278 --> 03:26:10,872
a saint went in that jeep with a
child. what is all this?

305
03:26:11,415 --> 03:26:12,882
y ou must be tired.
what is the police doing here?

306
03:26:13,250 --> 03:26:14,274
rest for a while.

307
03:26:16,920 --> 03:26:18,387
what was the police doing here?
that girl,...

308
03:26:18,922 --> 03:26:21,220
the one who went in the jeep?
the police had come for her.

309
03:26:21,925 --> 03:26:24,894
why?
there"s a child in the fruit basket.

310
03:26:26,096 --> 03:26:29,395
lt was that girl"s child.
this is very confusing.

311
03:26:29,933 --> 03:26:32,561
just relax.
l know everything.

312
03:26:32,936 --> 03:26:35,564
lt is a very long story.
he confuses everyone.

313
03:26:36,940 --> 03:26:41,900
he refuses to marry but
has several girlfriends.

314
03:26:42,279 --> 03:26:47,307
what are you saying?
l know about all your activities.

315
03:26:48,318 --> 03:26:51,913
he thinks he"s the
eternal romeo

316
03:26:52,956 --> 03:26:56,323
y ou could"ve admonished me rather
than carrying tales to grandad.

317
03:26:57,294 --> 03:26:58,420
l wonder what will
happen now.

318
03:27:02,332 --> 03:27:05,267
what will happen to these children
if we get arrested?

319
03:27:06,470 --> 03:27:11,931
l too am thinking the same.
let"s take up a job.

320
03:27:12,476 --> 03:27:18,938
lt is not so easy to
get a job.

321
03:27:19,983 --> 03:27:21,951
and the salary will never be
enough to fend for everyone.

322
03:27:25,989 --> 03:27:29,948
our family is really
very huge.

323
03:27:31,394 --> 03:27:34,955
why don"t we distribute
these children?

324
03:27:36,399 --> 03:27:39,368
what are you saying?
remember the kapoor"s from america.

325
03:27:40,003 --> 03:27:42,369
they wanted to adopt a child.
we"ve their address.

326
03:27:43,406 --> 03:27:45,340
and this way all the children
can be adopted.

327
03:27:46,376 --> 03:27:49,368
only we"ll be left.

328
03:27:53,383 --> 03:27:59,344
y our talks make sense but l
can"t live without them.

329
03:28:00,023 --> 03:28:04,392
this will improve their life.

330
03:28:05,028 --> 03:28:06,325
lsn"t that what you
also wanted?

331
03:28:07,430 --> 03:28:11,366
y es.
then l"ll talk to mr kapoor.

332
03:28:22,045 --> 03:28:26,175
why have you dressed us up?
ls it someone"s birthday?

333
03:28:27,450 --> 03:28:30,010
no.

334
03:28:31,221 --> 03:28:34,384
today a child"s luck will improve.
how?

335
03:28:37,561 --> 03:28:39,028
one of you will go

350
03:29:52,135 --> 03:29:55,502

the children are not naughty.

351
03:29:56,539 --> 03:29:59,508

they are very studious.

353
03:30:02,512 --> 03:30:05,481

we yearn for a child.
we are blessed with all riches.

03:36:34,871 --> 03:36:37,840
y ou all are under the impression
that l don"t love chintu?

400
03:36:39,542 --> 03:36:44,502
he is cripple and l"ve sent
him there for his own good.

401
03:36:46,549 --> 03:36:51,851
only they can afford to
treat him.

436
03:40:19,262 --> 03:40:24,723
he hasn"t eaten anything.
he can"t stay without you.

437
03:40:25,935 --> 03:40:29,063
l don"t want my happiness at
the cost of his happiness.

438
03:40:29,672 --> 03:40:30,730
let him stay here with you.

439
03:40:31,774 --> 03:40:34,902

03:46:21,123 --> 03:46:25,082

lt must be dead.

509
03:46:25,628 --> 03:46:30,588
this was my last chance.

511
03:46:39,141 --> 03:46:44,101
money can"t compensate for
my child.

512
03:46:50,286 --> 03:46:51,446

513
03:46:53,555 --> 03:46:54,783

03:47:54,216 --> 03:47:59,552
beauty, have you seen a bird?

527
03:48:01,056 --> 03:48:04,514
lt resides where the
crow pecks.

y our moustache hurts.

529

what is her name?
ms sapna.

585
04:00:11,953 --> 04:00:19,917
wrong she is not a dream
but a reality.

586
04:00:21,463 --> 04:00:23,931
certain dreams always
come true.

587
04:00:26,968 --> 04:00:30,335
princess, if you don"t mind
can l ask you something?

588
04:00:31,339 --> 04:00:32,931
do you have a family
history of mad people?

589
04:00:33,475 --> 04:00:36,933
what are you saying, grandad?
there"s no such history.

590
04:00:37,645 --> 04:00:41,342
but l have a family history of mad
people. my grandfather was mad.

591
04:00:42,150 --> 04:00:43,947

l"ve forgotten his name.

592
04:00:44,319 --> 04:00:46,287

how did you fall for
this idiot?

the princess is fond of
all sorts of animals.

596
04:00:58,399 --> 04:00:59,366
that"s the reason you
are her secretary.

597
04:01:02,003 --> 04:01:05,302
y ou didn"t tell me why
you like him?

598
04:01:06,508 --> 04:01:12,469
he is one in a million.
he is incomparable.

599
04:01:14,015 --> 04:01:17,143
we love each other
very much.

600
04:01:19,020 --> 04:01:21,989
this is the first time he"s
behaved sensibly.

601
04:01:22,524 --> 04:01:24,992

l"ll stay alone in the palace.

608
04:01:50,051 --> 04:01:53,020
her father will call up.

609
04:01:53,454 --> 04:01:56,014
she can redirect the
calls here.

610
04:01:57,425 --> 04:02:00,519
send her things here. y ou don"t
come and redirect her calls.

611
04:02:01,229 --> 04:02:02,355
l shouldn"t come?

612
04:02:05,567 --> 04:02:13,030
grandad, let me go today.
y ou"ve livened this place.

613
04:02:13,575 --> 04:02:19,411
l realised today that this is your
picture and you are anup"s beloved.

614
04:02:20,081 --> 04:02:23,278
so you"ll stay here till your
father comes back from london.

615
04:02:25,086 --> 04:02:27,554
anup, l"m waiting for both of
you at the dining table.

616
04:02:33,094 --> 04:02:36,427

619
04:02:43,104 --> 04:02:46,073
l have to leave immediately.
give me the money.

620
04:02:46,441 --> 04:02:49,410
l"ll inform the police
and get you arrested.

621
04:02:51,379 --> 04:02:53,574
now you are holding me forcefully
but what if l escape later.

622
04:02:54,515 --> 04:02:58,076
l"ll show this picture to the
police and get you arrested.

623
04:03:00,121 --> 04:03:03,488
do as l tell you and l"ll
pay you handsomely.

624
04:03:08,129 --> 04:03:11,496
sir, the chairman"s on the line.
ask him to call up in the office.

625
04:03:14,502 --> 04:03:18,097
grandad, you forgot something?
what?

626
04:03:19,307 --> 04:03:21,502
l think l"ve carried
everything.

627
04:03:22,644 --> 04:03:26,102
y our stick.
l deliberately left it behind.

628
04:03:27,382 --> 04:03:30,112
since your arrival l don"t
feel the need of this.

629
04:03:31,519 --> 04:03:34,488
l depend on you now.
will you ever leave me?

630
04:03:35,156 --> 04:03:39,456
how can you say that?
l"d told this to anup"s mother also.

631
04:03:40,161 --> 04:03:45,463
but she broke her promise.

632
04:03:47,669 --> 04:03:48,636
keep this.

633
04:03:51,539 --> 04:03:52,471
accountant, what is the matter?

634
04:03:52,840 --> 04:03:55,138
l"ve received a telegram from the
village and l"ve to leave immediately.

635
04:03:55,510 --> 04:03:57,501
what happened?
my son is sick.

636
04:03:58,680 --> 04:04:02,548
then you must leave.
keep this company money.

637
04:04:09,190 --> 04:04:11,556
dear, keep this money.
me?

638
04:04:12,527 --> 04:04:15,155
the lady of the house has to
take care of these things.

639
04:04:16,197 --> 04:04:18,563
and give these locker keys
to anup when he returns.

640
04:04:37,719 --> 04:04:39,186
so much money

641
04:04:39,554 --> 04:04:44,355
lf you can bring chintu to america,
l assure you he can be treated.

642
04:04:45,226 --> 04:04:49,526
then he won"t be dependent
on anyone.

643
04:04:50,732 --> 04:04:55,567
l"ll anyhow take chintu to america
and get him treated.

644
04:12:24,685 --> 04:12:26,653
y ou gave the locker keys
and the money to sapna?

645
04:12:27,188 --> 04:12:28,655
y eah, but why are you
so worried?

646
04:12:29,056 --> 04:12:31,024
l thought since you don"t need
the money l left it at home.

647
04:12:32,359 --> 04:12:35,021
do you need it?
y es...no....

648
04:12:36,197 --> 04:12:40,031
grandad in his ignorance gave
the keys to a thief.

649
04:12:41,068 --> 04:12:42,160
by now she must have
cleared the locker.

650
04:13:05,292 --> 04:13:08,056
y ou can"t open the locker without
keys. here are the keys.

651
04:13:11,732 --> 04:13:16,692
y ou were screaming.
l"m habituated to that.

652
04:13:17,238 --> 04:13:20,696
were you reminded of our first
meeting at the hotel?

653
04:13:22,743 --> 04:13:25,075
what are you saying?
l was bathing and so the delay.

654
04:13:27,348 --> 04:13:28,713
check the money.

655
04:13:40,261 --> 04:13:42,092
l can no longer wait
and so am leaving.

656
04:13:44,265 --> 04:13:45,732
y ou want to check?

657
04:13:54,375 --> 04:13:55,342
what is this you are doing?

658
04:13:59,179 --> 04:14:04,116
l don"t want to hurt grandad.

659
04:14:06,287 --> 04:14:10,246
lf that"s what you want, hand over
the keys to grandad personally.

660
04:14:14,028 --> 04:14:16,428
since your arrival in this house,
l don"t need any other support.

661
04:14:17,164 --> 04:14:18,131
now l depend only on you.

662
04:14:22,136 --> 04:14:28,097
prem, l give all my earnings to you
but l won"t touch the company money.

663
04:14:29,076 --> 04:14:32,136
l"m confident of winning the
jackpot today.

664
04:14:32,813 --> 04:14:35,145
then l"ll return the
entire amount.

665
04:14:35,983 --> 04:14:37,780
then we"ll live happily
with our child.

666
04:14:38,319 --> 04:14:42,153
children"s items.
go there.

667
04:14:47,828 --> 04:14:49,796
what do you want?
children"s items.

668
04:14:51,999 --> 04:14:57,198
feeding bottles, nipples, napkins.
and a mosquito net.

669
04:15:02,209 --> 04:15:06,305
perhaps this is your first child.
no, this is my 14th child.

670
04:15:08,849 --> 04:15:13,809
all are yours?
ls the government aware of it?

671
04:15:14,088 --> 04:15:16,818
sir, we have no family planning
in our happy home.

672
04:15:17,191 --> 04:15:22,185
we don"t know their parentage.
how is that possible?

673
04:15:22,262 --> 04:15:24,492
they belong to people like you.
what are you saying?

674
04:15:25,399 --> 04:15:28,197
l"ve come to buy items
for my orphanage.

675
04:15:28,869 --> 04:15:31,201
now l get it.
then hurry up.

676
04:15:32,873 --> 04:15:37,173
y ou are doing a commendable job
of running an orphanage.

677
04:15:38,245 --> 04:15:39,212
only a mother can understand
this.

678
04:15:40,881 --> 04:15:43,850
they must be troubling a lot.
y es, initially.

679
04:15:44,885 --> 04:15:47,353
a few days ago an infant was
brought there.

680
04:15:48,389 --> 04:15:50,857
he misses his parents and
cries for them.

681
04:15:51,892 --> 04:15:52,859
does he cry a lot?
y es.

682
04:15:53,560 --> 04:15:58,862
l wonder how parents have the heart
to live without their children?

683
04:16:00,401 --> 04:16:07,364
but in a few days, he"ll
settle down.

684
04:16:08,909 --> 04:16:11,377
can l give a tin of milk food
for that child?

685
04:16:11,912 --> 04:16:13,880
certainly

686
04:16:26,427 --> 04:16:28,895
are you hurt?
lt"s you who"ll be hurt.

687
04:16:35,169 --> 04:16:38,900
that poor girl will lose
her job.

688
04:16:40,441 --> 04:16:43,410
sister says that it"s not done
to con the innocent.

689
04:17:01,361 --> 04:17:03,261
scoundrel
colonel?

690
04:17:03,964 --> 04:17:06,262
what were you doing?
l was keeping the money back.

691
04:17:06,967 --> 04:17:10,266
y ou were stealing or keeping?
that girl"s boyfriend robbed it.

692
04:17:10,971 --> 04:17:12,268
l"ve come to buy things for
the children.

693
04:17:12,973 --> 04:17:14,600
first you come to the wedding
with your sister"s child.

694
04:17:15,142 --> 04:17:16,939
and now you want to buy things
for your child.

695
04:17:17,478 --> 04:17:21,938
believe me. l get trapped even
when l"m doing good for others.

696
04:17:22,316 --> 04:17:25,308
l"ll court martial you.
atleast let me expalin myself.

697
04:17:25,986 --> 04:17:27,954
this man is a thief.

698
04:17:29,990 --> 04:17:31,958
thief nab him

699
04:17:33,994 --> 04:17:41,298

700
04:18:23,043 --> 04:18:25,011

701
04:18:28,549 --> 04:18:31,017
bring me down or l"ll
court martial you.

702
04:18:33,053 --> 04:18:36,352
l"ll bring you down
but only after a nice shower.

703
04:18:44,398 --> 04:18:45,695
l"ll catch a cold.

704
04:18:56,243 --> 04:18:57,710
where are you going?

705
04:19:06,086 --> 04:19:07,553
show me some materials.

706
04:19:08,422 --> 04:19:10,390
this seems good.
l want it for 14 children.

707
04:19:11,091 --> 04:19:12,558
son, isn"t he your
brotherinlaw?

708
04:19:14,094 --> 04:19:17,063
where is my wife and child?

709
04:19:23,604 --> 04:19:27,062
lnspector, he is that rogue.

04:19:27,774 --> 04:19:32,438
there, you are trapped
now play your next move.

711
04:19:33,280 --> 04:19:34,747
what move should l play?

712
04:19:35,782 --> 04:19:37,750
now there are no more moves
as the game is over.

713
04:19:38,352 --> 04:19:42,482
ls this the time to come?

714
04:19:43,290 --> 04:19:45,451
had it not been for that rogue
l"d have been punctual.

715
04:19:46,126 --> 04:19:48,458
who?
he came for my friend"s son"s,...

718
04:19:55,535 --> 04:19:59,096
l nabbed him while he was stealing
cash from a departmental store.

719
04:20:00,140 --> 04:20:02,438
whom did you nab?
his sister is at large but l"ll,...

720
04:20:05,145 --> 04:20:08,114

your sneezes.

04:20:10,150 --> 04:20:11,777
l"ll send for you a
hot cup of tea.

722
04:20:12,486 --> 04:20:14,113

04:20:19,326 --> 04:20:20,452

04:20:34,508 --> 04:20:35,805
no.
l"ll send the tea.

730
04:20:36,677 --> 04:20:44,140
lt"s a strange coincidence that
that rogue"s sister resembled you.

731
04:20:44,518 --> 04:20:47,146
what?
l don"t mean she is the one.

732
04:20:48,555 --> 04:20:50,318
but it is a strange
coincidence.

733
04:20:51,692 --> 04:20:55,150
y our cold has numbed your senses.
y ou think she"s a fraud?

734

y ou come here.
this is a strange coincidence.

738
04:21:14,581 --> 04:21:21,180
colonel, everything in this world
is so strange.

739
04:21:27,227 --> 04:21:28,524
what happened?

740
04:21:30,630 --> 04:21:33,190
doctor, are you confident that
it is not a fracture?

741
04:21:33,600 --> 04:21:35,568
are you mad to question
the doctor"s diagnosis?

742
04:21:36,603 --> 04:21:40,562
but the bone has dislocated.
she needs rest for two weeks.

743
04:21:43,744 --> 04:21:46,542
doctor, we"ll follow your orders.

04:22:40,300 --> 04:22:45,602
l"ve given him an injection but ask
your sister to call me up.

759
04:22:46,306 --> 04:22:49,275
where"s the money for medicines?
even sister is missing.

760
04:22:49,810 --> 04:22:51,607
even chandu uncle hasn"t

04:23:31,852 --> 04:23:35,310
l"m not concerned about
my leg.

767
04:23:35,856 --> 04:23:40,486

which god should l pray?
anyone.

786
04:25:31,972 --> 04:25:33,769
don"t you remember sister
saying that god is one?

787
04:25:34,841 --> 04:25:36,775
god helps those who help
themselves.

788
04:25:37,477 --> 04:25:39,843

04:35:03,576 --> 04:35:07,012
lt was not so easy for me.

836
04:35:24,430 --> 04:35:25,522
sister, don"t cry.

837
04:35:27,233 --> 04:35:31,363
nandu, l know that l"ve
hurt you.

838
04:35:32,905 --> 04:35:35,032
but l had to do it to
treat chintu.

839
04:35:35,575 --> 04:35:39,033
l can be treated here also.
really?

840
04:35:39,445 --> 04:35:44,041
y es, l"d taken him to a specialist
and this is his opinion.

841
04:35:45,084 --> 04:35:49,077
sister, he is very nice.
he even bought us new clothes.

842
04:35:49,755 --> 04:35:52,383
lt was he who got me
released on bail.

843
04:35:53,092 --> 04:35:55,219
he"s bought tickets for
the circus also.

844
04:35:55,595 --> 04:36:01,397
y eah?
children, let"s go.

845
04:36:05,104 --> 04:36:09,234
when l refused to recognise them,
how did you recognise them?

846
04:36:10,509 --> 04:36:14,240
l recognised chintu. the man from
whom l"d purchased your picture,...

847
04:36:15,548 --> 04:36:17,573
had told me that the picture was
made by a crippled child.

848
04:36:18,517 --> 04:36:26,083
that is not me.
y ou are much better than that.

849
04:36:27,627 --> 04:36:32,257
y ou live in the hearts of
these children.

850
04:36:33,633 --> 04:36:37,091
why are they so dear
to you?

851
04:36:38,638 --> 04:36:39,605
to protect them.

852
04:36:41,307 --> 04:36:43,104
society is rude with
the poor.

853
04:36:45,511 --> 04:36:51,507
an orphan boy finds himself in jail
& a girl is forced into prostitution.

854
04:36:53,152 --> 04:36:56,121
that"s the reason your
portrait is so angelic.

855
04:36:57,490 --> 04:37:02,120
y ou are worthy of devotion.
l want to adore you.

856
04:37:19,545 --> 04:37:21,979
who are you?
a jeweler.

857
04:37:22,682 --> 04:37:24,650
how did you come here?
the same way as you come here.

858
04:37:25,351 --> 04:37:31,153
what does that mean?
l have more right on this house.

859
04:37:33,192 --> 04:37:37,561
y ou"ve come to extract your
pound of flesh and so have l.

860
04:37:38,197 --> 04:37:39,164
what do you mean?

861
04:37:39,565 --> 04:37:42,159
l"m that old man"s daughter"s
only son.

862
04:37:44,203 --> 04:37:48,572
just as your anup is that
old man"s son"s only son.

863
04:37:50,876 --> 04:37:53,538
my mother had a love
marriage.

864
04:37:54,747 --> 04:37:56,840
so the old man threw her
out of this house.

865
04:37:58,584 --> 04:38:00,176
and l became homeless.

866
04:38:01,554 --> 04:38:07,186
despite being a fake princess
you had a front door entry.

867
04:38:08,227 --> 04:38:12,561
and despite being a member of this
house l"d to make a back door entry.

868
04:38:13,399 --> 04:38:15,196
lt"s a matter of timing

869
04:38:16,602 --> 04:38:20,538
we both are here for money.

870
04:38:21,240 --> 04:38:25,700
l don"t want money.
then why are you here?

871
04:38:28,247 --> 04:38:34,550
think rationally. one thief
shouldn"t cheat another thief.

872
04:38:36,756 --> 04:38:39,623
one dog doesn"t outsmart
another dog.

873
04:38:41,260 --> 04:38:42,625
lt is you who are a dog.
l"m,...

874
04:39:05,785 --> 04:39:09,243
y ou can not forget those
days.

875
04:39:10,289 --> 04:39:14,749
y our charms can work on that
old man not on me.

876
04:39:17,129 --> 04:39:20,758
from a prostitute you want to become
the daughterinlaw of this house.

877
04:39:22,301 --> 04:39:24,769
and want the entire property
for yourself.

878
04:39:25,971 --> 04:39:30,271
l only want my share
here and there.

879
04:39:34,313 --> 04:39:39,615
return the necklace or l"ll shout.
go ahead and scream.

880
04:39:40,319 --> 04:39:43,652
l too want to expose you.

881
04:39:44,824 --> 04:39:51,627
and then that old man will
get you arrested.

882
04:40:00,339 --> 04:40:05,675
champabai, l promise to keep
my mouth shut.

883
04:40:06,846 --> 04:40:09,679
besides, you stand to
gain a lot.

884
04:40:11,016 --> 04:40:12,643
my demands are very few.

885
04:40:15,955 --> 04:40:18,651
there comes your admirer

886
04:40:19,358 --> 04:40:20,484
hide.

887
04:40:27,366 --> 04:40:30,335
sapna, hurry up, grandad is
waiting for you.

888
04:40:30,870 --> 04:40:31,837
don"t come in,
l"m changing.

889
04:40:33,372 --> 04:40:36,739
next time, keep the door shut
while you are changing.

890
04:40:38,377 --> 04:40:39,344
l"m waiting for you.

891
04:40:41,881 --> 04:40:45,840
he"s besotted by you.
get out of here

892
04:40:46,385 --> 04:40:50,344
y ou are throwing me out
of my own home

893
04:40:56,896 --> 04:40:59,729
champabai will become my
grandad"s daughterinlaw.

894
04:41:00,900 --> 04:41:06,361
now we can lay our hands
on a lot more money.

895
04:41:08,641 --> 04:41:16,741
l"m resorting to blackmailing
for what is rightfully mine.

896
04:41:19,418 --> 04:41:21,784
today l"ve got the first
installment.

897
04:41:21,921 --> 04:41:26,381
ln gold?
no, in diamonds.

898
04:41:27,426 --> 04:41:28,723
really?
y es.

899
04:41:30,930 --> 04:41:32,898
lt is a very beautiful
diamond necklace.

900
04:41:34,600 --> 04:41:40,732
lt"ll dazzle your eyes.
y ou too keep your eyes covered.

901
04:41:47,947 --> 04:41:53,408
l"d kept it here.
where did it disappear?

902
04:41:55,454 --> 04:41:56,751
who could"ve flicked it?

903
04:42:01,961 --> 04:42:05,920
y ou want to cheat her but instead
she has cheated you.

904
04:42:07,833 --> 04:42:08,925
times have changed

905
04:42:17,643 --> 04:42:19,770
anup, he says the l"m looking
younger by 20 years.

906
04:42:20,479 --> 04:42:21,776
shall l announce my engagement
too?

907
04:42:24,817 --> 04:42:27,809
colonel, do you know of
any nubile nymphet?

908
04:42:28,487 --> 04:42:30,785
do you plan to
get arrested?

909
04:42:32,491 --> 04:42:37,952
the party is great
but where is the princess?

910
04:42:39,164 --> 04:42:39,960
don"t, it"ll be a
bad omen.

911
04:42:43,502 --> 04:42:49,463
where is sapna?
y ou know women take long to dress.

912
04:42:50,509 --> 04:42:53,478
y ou"ve got experience even
before marriage.

913
04:42:53,746 --> 04:42:54,974
afterall l"m your grandson.

914
04:42:57,516 --> 04:42:59,984
mehra, who are the invitees from
the princess" family?

915
04:43:01,020 --> 04:43:02,817
as her parents are abroad
there"s nobody else.

916
04:43:03,188 --> 04:43:03,984
neither will anybody come.

917
04:43:10,029 --> 04:43:14,864
grandad, your daughterinlaw
comes from a family,...

918
04:43:15,901 --> 04:43:18,495
where only the mother is
known not the father.

919
04:43:19,204 --> 04:43:21,172
what nonsense are you talking?
who invited you?

920
04:43:22,041 --> 04:43:26,000
l"m sorry as l wasn"t invited.
then why did you come?

921
04:43:27,046 --> 04:43:29,879
l"ve come here for
two purposes.

922
04:43:31,884 --> 04:43:36,014
the groom is my younger brother
and l know the bride also.

923
04:43:36,922 --> 04:43:42,918
how do you know her?
y ou"ll adorn her forehead,...

924
04:43:44,897 --> 04:43:46,524
while l"ll adorn her feet.

925
04:43:46,965 --> 04:43:54,531
what nonsense are you talking?
she"s a prostitute not a princess.

926
04:43:54,940 --> 04:43:58,535
what nonsense
lf you don"t believe me ask her.

927
04:44:02,581 --> 04:44:04,208
nanny, call sapna.

928
04:44:05,250 --> 04:44:12,884
prem, l"ll kill you with these
anklets if this is not true.

929
04:44:13,592 --> 04:44:18,552
my neck is too thick
for this.

930
04:44:18,964 --> 04:44:22,957
then my hands will do
the job.

931
04:44:23,769 --> 04:44:28,069
l considered it my duty to
withhold your honour.

932
04:44:30,609 --> 04:44:33,976
because my mother had walked
out of this house.

933
04:44:35,114 --> 04:44:36,945
she had not come here from
a brothel.

934
04:44:37,850 --> 04:44:41,946
sir, sapna is not in her room.
what are you saying?

935
04:44:42,621 --> 04:44:44,589
she"s left behind the
necklace and a letter.

936
04:44:45,791 --> 04:44:49,750
dear grandad, anup bestowed
his love on me.

937
04:44:50,996 --> 04:44:55,592
but l"m not worthy of being
your daughterinlaw.

938
04:44:56,869 --> 04:44:59,269
l tried confiding my past
to anup.

939
04:45:01,807 --> 04:45:05,607
my life bears a stigma.
l did get over that life,...

940
04:45:06,645 --> 04:45:09,273
but that still doesn"t
alter the truth.

941
04:45:10,649 --> 04:45:15,609
l don"t want my stigma to
affect anup"s life,...

942
04:45:16,989 --> 04:45:21,119
and so l am going.

943
04:45:21,660 --> 04:45:24,788
l"m not a princess but l was
born and brought up in a brothel.

944
04:45:25,664 --> 04:45:29,122
do you believe me now, grandad?
this is a pack of lies.

945
04:45:32,004 --> 04:45:34,973
grandad, this is not possible.
everything is possible.

946
04:45:37,009 --> 04:45:40,638
only the decent people are
threatened with murder.

947
04:45:42,681 --> 04:45:47,050
but how were you conned?
l was aware she"s not a princess.

948
04:45:48,687 --> 04:45:50,655
y ou knew about it?
y es.

949
04:45:51,690 --> 04:45:53,658
then why did you present her to
me as a princess?

950
04:45:55,194 --> 04:45:58,027
her qualities and beauty are
no less than a princess".

951
04:45:58,697 --> 04:46:00,665
but she herself has written
that she was a prostitute.

952
04:46:01,700 --> 04:46:04,168
a person should be judged
by his deeds.

953
04:46:04,703 --> 04:46:08,036
anup, family backgrounds decide
a marriage not ones deeds.

954
04:46:08,941 --> 04:46:14,038
grandad, an ordinary stone if kept
inside a temple is worshipped.

955
04:46:14,880 --> 04:46:17,849
whatever, but l can"t accept a
prostitute as my daughterinlaw.

956
04:46:18,717 --> 04:46:22,084
lotus though grows in muck is yet
considered auspicious and worshipped.

957
04:46:23,222 --> 04:46:26,191
what do you mean?
l want to marry sapna.

958
04:46:27,226 --> 04:46:30,059
lf you do that, l"ll sever all
ties with you.

959
04:46:30,729 --> 04:46:32,697
lf you are firm then l
don"t care about it.

960
04:46:33,098 --> 04:46:36,067
what?
truth is above all relationships.

961
04:46:37,236 --> 04:46:41,036
by speaking the truth she has
risen above all of us.

962
04:46:43,742 --> 04:46:46,108
this is not you but your
rotten culture talking.

963
04:46:47,079 --> 04:46:50,708
how dare you abuse my
scion?

964
04:46:52,117 --> 04:46:56,713
l"m sorry, sir, but l"m
not abusing your scion.

965
04:46:57,756 --> 04:47:00,088
anup is not your grandson.
what?

966
04:47:04,763 --> 04:47:09,097
what are you saying?
l"m compelled to say this.

967
04:47:09,935 --> 04:47:11,903
what is it?
a secret.

968
04:47:13,772 --> 04:47:19,142
after your son"s sudden demise
his wife was pregnant.

969
04:47:20,145 --> 04:47:23,581
l prayed to god for a
male child.

970
04:47:24,283 --> 04:47:28,913
so that your property remains safe
from prem and his scoundrel father.

971
04:47:30,122 --> 04:47:36,857
but the child was a daughter.
and daughterinlaw too died.

972
04:47:40,299 --> 04:47:46,169
then who is anup?
l brought him from an orphanage.

973
04:47:47,139 --> 04:47:51,098
and nurtured him as your grandson.
where is that girl?

974
04:47:52,811 --> 04:47:54,779
l handed her over to a lady.

975
04:47:55,981 --> 04:47:58,779
and regularly sent her money
for the child"s maintenance.

976
04:47:59,184 --> 04:48:03,780
but who was that lady?
her name was ratna.

977
04:48:04,189 --> 04:48:06,783
where is she?
l don"t know that.

978
04:48:07,826 --> 04:48:11,785
she"s changed her residence.
l wonder where she is now.

979
04:48:13,198 --> 04:48:16,167
nanny, you"ve made a
grave mistake.

980
04:48:16,835 --> 04:48:18,962
y ou made our child undergo so
many hardships in life.

981
04:48:27,346 --> 04:48:33,148
some children resided here?
they"ve left this place.

982
04:48:34,019 --> 04:48:37,182
champa wasn"t ratnabai"s daughter.
then whose daughter was she?

983
04:48:38,023 --> 04:48:41,186
l think she belonged to
a decent family.

984
04:48:42,194 --> 04:48:45,163
a few years ago she managed
to escape from here.

985
04:48:46,365 --> 04:48:53,828
sir, l assure you that
she was chaste.

986
04:48:55,874 --> 04:49:01,835
did she ever come here?
a girl never returns to this place.

987
04:49:04,282 --> 04:49:07,342
l want to meet ratna.
she left last night,...

988
04:49:08,053 --> 04:49:09,213
with a young man.

989
04:49:10,055 --> 04:49:12,250
lt is my profession to
con people.

990
04:49:13,392 --> 04:49:17,852
l"ll see to it that those people
accept this girl as their own.

991
04:49:19,231 --> 04:49:22,860
rupa, do as she guides you.
she will.

992
04:49:25,070 --> 04:49:29,268
darling, we are doing all
this for our child.

993
04:49:34,146 --> 04:49:38,048
y ou go as ratnabai"s son and
see to it that we succeed.

994
04:49:39,418 --> 04:49:45,220
keep in mind my success also.
don"t bother about that.

995
04:49:46,925 --> 04:49:50,224
the real champa cheated you but
l"ll give you another chance.

996
04:49:51,596 --> 04:49:53,894
y ou"ll reap the fruits of your
youth in your old age.

997
04:49:54,299 --> 04:49:56,893
thankyou
come, dear.

998
04:50:02,941 --> 04:50:05,239
the old woman is very
experienced.

999
04:50:07,112 --> 04:50:09,910
after she outlives her utility
we must finish her off.

1000
04:50:10,949 --> 04:50:13,417
both of them.

1001
04:50:14,953 --> 04:50:18,912
both?
the real champa and the old woman.

1002
04:50:23,462 --> 04:50:25,430
l"d made this for my
daughterinlaw.

1003
04:50:26,965 --> 04:50:30,264
l"d given this with the
child as a symbol.

1004
04:50:32,471 --> 04:50:36,305
why did you disappear suddenly?
l became greedy.

1005
04:50:37,476 --> 04:50:41,936
l got a vision from the goddess
that she is an angel.

1006
04:50:42,481 --> 04:50:45,279
and that it"s beneficial for
me to be with her.

1007
04:50:46,485 --> 04:50:48,953
and so l took her along
to mathura.

1008
04:50:49,988 --> 04:50:54,357
why did you bring her here?
the lord is omniscient.

1009
04:50:54,993 --> 04:51:00,954
l got a vision to return her
back to her family.

1010
04:51:01,333 --> 04:51:04,302
otherwise calamity will
strike this family.

1011
04:51:05,203 --> 04:51:07,467
and that l should then
return to hardwar.

1012
04:51:09,508 --> 04:51:11,476
keep her with you and free
me of my responsibility.

1013
04:51:14,012 --> 04:51:17,345
mother, don"t leave me behind.

1014
04:51:18,016 --> 04:51:21,975
dear, this is your own home.
y ou must stay here.

1015
04:51:23,522 --> 04:51:26,491
but l can"t stay without her.
l understand that.

1016
04:51:27,359 --> 04:51:30,351
y ou both can also stay here.

1017
04:51:31,363 --> 04:51:33,388
the lord doesn"t will so.
please let us go.

1018
04:51:36,201 --> 04:51:39,500
parents can sacrifice their
all for their children.

1019
04:51:41,373 --> 04:51:45,332
but, brother,...
one has to fulfill ones duties.

1020
04:51:47,045 --> 04:51:49,275
lsn"t it so, grandad?
y es.

1021
04:51:50,048 --> 04:51:51,015
mother, let"s go.

1022
04:51:55,420 --> 04:51:57,354
sister, how can l cook?
there"s nothing in the house.

1023
04:51:58,056 --> 04:52:00,388
y ou should"ve told me this earlier.
l"d have sold off my bangles.

1024
04:52:01,059 --> 04:52:03,687
this is the only ornament
left now.

1025
04:52:04,429 --> 04:52:07,364
sister, why don"t we sell
this locket?

1026
04:52:08,233 --> 04:52:11,361
we have no right to sell
this locket.

1027
04:52:12,070 --> 04:52:14,368
l won"t let anyone sell anything
that belongs to any child.

1028
04:52:15,407 --> 04:52:19,400
okay.
uncle, chintu has sent a letter.

1029
04:52:19,578 --> 04:52:22,046
since when did you
learn writing?

1030
04:52:23,081 --> 04:52:24,378
sister, chintu writes
a letter daily.

1031
04:52:30,088 --> 04:52:32,386
what is this?
l won"t lie.

1032
04:52:33,758 --> 04:52:35,055
since 4 days it is chintu who
is running the home.

1033
04:52:35,594 --> 04:52:38,222
what do you mean?
he doesn"t beg or steal.

1034
04:52:39,097 --> 04:52:42,066
he makes portraits and
earns money.

1035
04:52:43,602 --> 04:52:45,433
lt means he sacrifices his
education for this.

1036
04:52:48,106 --> 04:52:49,073
where is he?

1037
04:52:54,112 --> 04:52:56,410
l"m not begging but am
slogging for a living.

1038
04:52:56,781 --> 04:52:59,409
don"t irritate me.

1039
04:53:00,285 --> 04:53:02,480
mr prem, look, she"s coming
here.

1040
04:53:03,121 --> 04:53:05,589
chintu, aren"t you ashamed to give
up your studies to do this work?

1041
04:53:06,491 --> 04:53:07,583
come home.

1042
04:53:12,130 --> 04:53:14,428
y ou?
follow me without a fuss.

1043
04:55:46,284 --> 04:55:49,583
what is the matter?
some goons have kidnapped sister.

1044
04:55:50,288 --> 04:55:52,586
where to and who were they?
they were some goons.

1045
04:55:53,291 --> 04:55:54,588
do you know them?
no.

1046
04:55:56,294 --> 04:55:57,261
but l can make his sketch.

1047
04:55:58,797 --> 04:55:59,764
come with me.

1048
04:56:05,637 --> 04:56:07,605
this is prem.
did you see this man?

1049
04:56:07,972 --> 04:56:10,270
y es, they were in a black car with
one front head light broken.

1050
04:56:11,309 --> 04:56:13,277
l know this man.
he"s a rogue.

1051
04:56:13,645 --> 04:56:15,772
how do you know him?
l saw him in a departmental store.

1052
04:56:16,314 --> 04:56:18,282
he was stealing his
girlfriend"s money.

1053
04:56:18,817 --> 04:56:21,285
he"s kidnapped our sister.
we won"t spare him.

1054
04:56:22,487 --> 04:56:23,784
how dare he

1055
04:56:25,824 --> 04:56:28,452
congratulations
we"ve trapped both of them.

1056
04:56:30,829 --> 04:56:36,665
murder her.
but she"s my relative.

1057
04:56:38,703 --> 04:56:39,965
necessity is the mother
of all evils.

1058
04:56:41,005 --> 04:56:43,303
y et, l won"t be able to
kill her.

1059
04:56:44,509 --> 04:56:45,806
then use me.

1060
04:56:53,852 --> 04:56:55,319
madan, accompany him.

1061
04:56:58,723 --> 04:57:02,819
since he can"t see his sister"s
marriage help him in cremating her.

1062
04:57:06,364 --> 04:57:08,491
l"ll arrange for the coffin.

1063
04:57:09,701 --> 04:57:11,669
what are you saying?
l"m speaking the truth.

1064
04:57:13,371 --> 04:57:14,838
y ou are raisaheb"s
granddaughter.

1065
04:57:16,708 --> 04:57:18,335
l?
y es.

1066
04:57:19,377 --> 04:57:25,680
and rupa?
she"s prem"s accomplice.

1067
04:57:26,885 --> 04:57:30,685
on their behest l planted
her there as champa.

1068
04:57:32,557 --> 04:57:37,358
what is this you did, mother?
don"t address me as mother.

1069
04:57:38,563 --> 04:57:40,030
after this point l don"t
know where they went.

1070
04:57:40,398 --> 04:57:41,763
there is a dead end
after this.

1071
04:57:43,067 --> 04:57:44,762
lt means they are in
this vicinity.

1072
04:57:45,737 --> 04:57:46,704
y ou go to the police station.

1073
04:57:47,405 --> 04:57:50,374
children, if you find a black
car with a broken head light,...

1074
04:57:51,075 --> 04:57:52,702
it means your sister
is there. go

1075
04:57:55,413 --> 04:57:58,746
chintu, we"ll use the same means to
find her that we"d employed earlier.

1076
04:59:32,010 --> 04:59:35,468
follow my orders or l"ll kill
these children.

1077
04:59:35,880 --> 04:59:37,472
why ?
because they"ve seen you.

1078
04:59:38,516 --> 04:59:40,848
call them upstairs.
l won"t.

1079
04:59:44,856 --> 04:59:45,823
why do you want to
kill them?

1080
04:59:46,190 --> 04:59:48,818
because l don"t want to give them
the chance to inform the police.

1081
04:59:49,694 --> 04:59:52,993
hurry up and call them
upstairs.

1082
04:59:57,535 --> 05:00:01,494
wait
l"ll call them.

1083
05:00:15,553 --> 05:00:19,512
chintu, come upstairs.

1084
05:00:27,799 --> 05:00:32,930
kill me instead and wipe
out all evidences.

1085
05:00:33,738 --> 05:00:39,904
y our secret will remain safe then.
y ou also want to reform.

1086
05:00:52,590 --> 05:00:56,890
now listen to me.
be silent.

1087
05:01:00,765 --> 05:01:04,064
oh, so you"ve brought them
here

1088
05:01:06,104 --> 05:01:08,072
he"s the one who kidnapped our
sister. rogue

1089
05:01:18,616 --> 05:01:19,583
no

1090
05:01:45,143 --> 05:01:46,110
finish him

1091
05:02:02,660 --> 05:02:04,127
hit him hard

1092
05:02:07,331 --> 05:02:08,855
stop it or l"ll kill you all.

1093
05:02:15,173 --> 05:02:16,640
get in.

1094
05:02:17,675 --> 05:02:20,974
under no circumstances
should he come up.

1095
05:02:41,199 --> 05:02:43,667
now it is your turn.
get ready to die.

1096
05:03:02,220 --> 05:03:09,023
l wanted to lock you both in a
coffin and dump it in the sea.

1097
05:03:10,061 --> 05:03:13,087
so that the crocodiles could
make a meal of you.

1098
05:03:18,736 --> 05:03:21,204
now end this facade of
motherly love.

1099
05:03:49,267 --> 05:03:51,735
brother has come

1100
05:06:23,254 --> 05:06:24,380
throw the gun.

1101
05:06:30,428 --> 05:06:35,889
l said throw the gun or l"ll
throw the child out.

1102
05:06:46,110 --> 05:06:51,241
how time changes
madan, take him and lock him.

1103
05:06:51,949 --> 05:06:54,918
tie him up and then blast
them all with a bomb.

1104
05:06:55,553 --> 05:07:00,923
l"ll take the mother and daughter.
the boss is waiting for you.

1105
05:07:32,156 --> 05:07:33,350
open the bonnet.

1106
05:09:01,779 --> 05:09:03,212
where is sapna?

1107
05:09:04,315 --> 05:09:12,723
prem has taken sapna and ratna
to meet the boss at tiger point.

1108
05:10:34,672 --> 05:10:37,140
dear, take me to your grandad.

1109
05:10:37,675 --> 05:10:40,803
so that l can tell him that
you are his real granddaughter.

1110
05:10:50,287 --> 05:10:55,486
where are you going? y ou wear
white clothes but do shady deals.

1111
05:10:59,196 --> 05:11:01,528
mother, speak.
corpses don"t talk.

1112
05:11:02,700 --> 05:11:07,660
how times change
and your time is over.

1113
05:11:08,205 --> 05:11:10,173
like how you killed
this lady?

1114
05:11:16,213 --> 05:11:17,510
l agree l"m not fond of him.

1115
05:11:18,549 --> 05:11:22,178
but l can"t bear a prostitute
make a mockery of my family.

1116
05:11:22,720 --> 05:11:25,188
don"t abuse your family.
what do you mean?

1117
05:11:27,224 --> 05:11:29,522
she is blemish less and is
your granddaughter.

1118
05:11:32,229 --> 05:11:33,196
then who is this girl?

1119
05:11:33,564 --> 05:11:36,533
she sell milk food tins in
a departmental store.

1120
05:11:38,402 --> 05:11:42,532
and this man is her
boyfriend.

1121
05:11:43,407 --> 05:11:45,204
what are you saying?
he is right.

1122
05:11:46,243 --> 05:11:48,711
l too had seen this girl there.
what?

1123
05:11:49,413 --> 05:11:54,214
they have a child also.
l heard them mentioning him.

1124
05:11:54,752 --> 05:11:57,220
this is a lie.
l don"t know them.

1125
05:11:58,422 --> 05:12:01,220
l neither have a boyfriend
nor a child.

1126
05:12:03,427 --> 05:12:04,724
remove this child.

1127
05:12:16,774 --> 05:12:19,402
god has his own ways to bring
the truth to light.

1128
05:12:20,644 --> 05:12:23,238
this name and locket
is yours.

1129
05:12:24,281 --> 05:12:26,249
y es, but this locket was
stolen.

1130
05:12:27,451 --> 05:12:30,249
brother, badal was wearing this
locket when he came to our home.

1131
05:12:30,621 --> 05:12:33,647
lt was l who stole the cash
so did the child steal the locket?

1132
05:12:34,792 --> 05:12:39,752
prem, this is your and her child.
no.

1133
05:12:46,303 --> 05:12:49,670
for their selfish ends people even
refuse to recognise their own child.

1134
05:12:51,308 --> 05:12:55,677
the child, whose mother refuses to
recognise him has no right to life.

1135
05:12:58,315 --> 05:13:00,647
like me, he too is unaware
of his lineage,....

1136
05:13:01,652 --> 05:13:04,780
so he has no right to live
to malign a decent family.

1137
05:13:05,556 --> 05:13:08,286
he is a burden which
l"ll throw out.

1138
05:13:10,327 --> 05:13:12,625
don"t throw my child.

1139
05:13:19,837 --> 05:13:21,634
grandad, this was prem"s ploy.

1140
05:13:22,840 --> 05:13:25,308
and he had laid this
condition to marry me.

1141
05:13:25,709 --> 05:13:29,668
and l agreed to help him for
the sake of my child and my honour.

1142
05:13:30,848 --> 05:13:32,315
sapna is your real
granddaughter.

1143
05:13:35,519 --> 05:13:36,986
punish me.

1144
05:13:39,356 --> 05:13:41,324
nab him.
let me go.

1145
05:13:41,692 --> 05:13:45,321
we arrested your entire gang.
how times change

1146
05:13:52,369 --> 05:13:56,567
dear, l"m sorry for all this but
you and the child will stay here.

1147
05:14:00,544 --> 05:14:02,739
dear, l"m sorry to have
maligned you.

1148
05:14:03,981 --> 05:14:06,575
l failed to recognise you.

1149
05:14:07,384 --> 05:14:09,682
this is your house and will
remain so.

1150
05:14:10,787 --> 05:14:13,688
grandad, l wanted to come here
as your daughterinlaw.

1151
05:14:15,058 --> 05:14:17,856
grandad, don"t let anup go.
anup, where are you going?

1152
05:14:19,630 --> 05:14:22,360
now that you"ve found your
granddaughter, let me go.

1153
05:14:22,733 --> 05:14:26,533
l"ve brought you up as my
own son. come here.

1154
05:14:27,905 --> 05:14:31,864
despite being a destitute this girl
has taken care of other destitutes.

1155
05:14:33,410 --> 05:14:35,708
and today you want to
leave her and go.

1156
05:14:36,580 --> 05:14:37,706
but,..
shut up

1157
05:14:37,915 --> 05:14:45,378
a dream girl is one who
helps others.

1158
05:14:45,756 --> 05:14:49,385
and me too. now l"m a grandfather
to all of you.

1159
05:14:49,927 --> 05:14:51,724
and this house will
be happy home.
