1
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,703
"He roars like a Lion."

2
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,637
"He is like fire."

3
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,972
"Ranna"

4
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,418
Leave me! Please!

5
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,051
Who are you?!

6
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,954
Leave me!

7
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,418
Why have you kidnapped me?
- Strip her!

8
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,896
Thank you, boss.
- Hey!

9
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,267
I mean, remove the blindfold.

10
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,661
Okay, boss

11
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,510
Why did you kidnap me?

12
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,338
Money. Money.

13
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,574
Did you phone him?

14
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,649
He said he will be here in sometime.

15
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,774
Till the one who gave
us the contract comes here.

16
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,785
Make her dance for u; boss.

17
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,252
Tell us your flashback.

18
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,361
I fell in love with a guy,
he had come to my house..

19
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,859
...l thought he loved me too..

20
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,429
"But realized he
had come for my mother.

21
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,767
For your mother?

22
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,432
This story began in
Zurich three months ago.

23
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,940
Where is Zurich?

24
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,380
In Swiss
- Where is that?

25
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,180
In Europe.

26
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,115
Where is that?

27
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,154
Do you want to know
geography or my history?

28
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,119
Goon

29
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,885
There is a family named Chandras.

30
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,055
Sharat Chandra,
proprietor of the company.

31
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,462
He is very rich.

32
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,534
Wham do you mean?

33
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,334
He is millionaire

34
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,299
He is millionaire?

35
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,735
You fell in love with an old man?

36
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,170
I fell in love with his power.

37
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,915
Do you IFC?

38
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,683
That's Investment Fund Company,
isn't it?

39
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,747
They are 7 percent share
holders of our company.

40
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,156
A man named Praveen Shetty
has purchased that company.

41
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,419
What does he want?

42
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,397
That chair.

43
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,432
The cost of that
chair is only 50 Euros.

44
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,732
...ifl sit on it.

45
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,402
...it will cost thousands of Euros
- That's why..

46
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,331
...he is eager to get to your chair.

47
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,876
He is purchasing our company shares from
everywhere by spending lot of money.

48
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,738
Those who refuse to sell,
he is threatening them.

49
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,077
No matter how hard he tries.

50
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,244
...he can never buy 60 percent of the
shares which belongs to our family.

51
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,286
40 percent.

52
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,218
...remaining 20 percent belongs
to your daughter Saraswami.

53
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,217
In the past 25 years, she has
never attended a single board meeting"

54
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,862
...nor she has claimed
the company ownership..

55
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:02,263
...knowing that, he is striving hard
to get 1 percent more ownership than us

56
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,629
How did he find out these details?

57
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,759
One can cover the wound on the palm.

58
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,268
"But not the wound on the forehead.

59
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,036
Outsiders can see it better than us

60
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,368
Try talking to him.

61
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,409
He owns yacht.

62
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,140
...and he is in that all the time.

63
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,484
He never receives anyone's phone..

64
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,912
...nor attends any meetings

65
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,791
So his own kingdom and he is the king.

66
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:30,994
Fair enough.

67
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,129
Then summon my grandson Bhargav.

68
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,895
It is not easy to revolt against him

69
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,070
He is always accompanied by bodyguard..

70
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,662
...carrying deadly weapons
who are well trained than army.

71
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,830
Weapon; meaning arms.

72
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,744
A true soldier doesn't
look for weapons.

73
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,576
"But he looks for his enemies.

74
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,674
My grandson Bhargav Chandra.

75
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,017
...is notjust a soldier,
but an army himself.

76
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,155
But Sharam.
- This meeting is over.

77
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,354
"They call him Ranna"

78
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,189
"He is gold."

79
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,261
"No one to match him."

80
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:31,874
Hey you!

81
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,216
Put your hands in the air!

82
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,200
Put your hands in the air!

83
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,238
Don't move!

84
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,249
Fire!

85
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:46,205
I guess you have kidnapped
me without knowing who I am

86
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,311
I guess you have kidnapped
me without knowing who I am

87
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,486
You are making a mistake

88
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,922
You purchased our company shares
without my family's knowledge.

89
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,892
...so there is no need for me to talk to
you about what's right and what's wrong.

90
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,564
Why do you want our company shares?
- It gives me a unique happiness.

91
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,232
You so scared for your life..

92
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,435
"Then why are you boasting so much?

93
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,045
I actually didn't miss the aim..

94
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,077
...you will be dead if
I miss my aim even by one inch

95
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,548
I won't talk much
to make you understand.

96
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,759
...l will come to the point straight.

97
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,924
The warning that I'm giving
you with love don't take it lightly.

98
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,732
Don't go by the smile on my face..

99
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,294
"But understand what
I'm trying to tell you.

100
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,959
If you trouble my family..

101
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,602
Alright, you won't understand like that.

102
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,771
To whatever extent you go..

103
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,875
...l will go way beyond that extent.

104
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,710
Okay?

105
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,315
Elders have said..

106
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,819
...to make a living,
hand full of rice, a glass of water".

107
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:09,559
...and little bit of place
is enough to make a living.

108
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,900
It is so right.

109
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,833
Follow it.

110
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,245
You say one has to be patient
to gain happiness and peace.

111
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,076
Good. Wait then.

112
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,251
But you won't gain them

113
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,680
You won't gain them even
after you become old like me.

114
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,523
Bhargav

115
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,662
Bhargav
- Grandpa

116
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,860
Do you know what my wish is?

117
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,135
My daughter, my son-in-law..

118
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,501
"Their children.

119
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,301
...everyone must have food together'.

120
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,611
The sound of their laughs..

121
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,445
...should be heard in this house.

122
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,810
I've been waiting for
them for the last 25 years.

123
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,953
...the food is getting digested
but my wish is not getting fulfilled.

124
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:08,323
They say as a man gets older,
he becomes like a child..

125
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,126
...and his children become his parents.

126
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,027
I want to see my daughter'.

127
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,461
In three months, I will turn 75.

128
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,167
Dear, will you bring
your aunt for my birthday?

129
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,146
VWII you bring my mother?

130
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,212
\Mll you stand?

131
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,077
You are crippled since three months
will you stand now?

132
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,354
You can't, isn't it?

133
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,852
Similarly, he won't bring her too.
- Hey.

134
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,820
It was you who sent her away,
why are you getting angry on me?

135
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,587
You gave her everything,
she still went away.

136
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,493
It won't take much time to
punish a person for his mistakes.

137
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,832
"But forget that it
can even break relationships.

138
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,602
He got married against my will..

139
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,030
...hence I ousted her from here

140
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,175
Now, I want to see her, bring her.

141
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,607
She has committed mistake..

142
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,234
...we cannot plead her to come
back since you want to see her.

143
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,275
No matter where earthquake
takes place..

144
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,545
...we can pinpoint the area
where it exactly happened.

145
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,616
But when there are
problems in a family..

146
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,119
...it is wrong to put the
entire blame on just one person.

147
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,388
Of course They say daughter
will one day become an outsiden.

148
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,294
...moreover,
his daughter left this house.

149
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,459
To say her that we are still alive..

150
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,436
...the things that we send to her,
she sends them back.

151
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,938
She herself doesn't need us

152
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,600
Her memories gave us only pain.

153
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,778
...so we decided to leave the country"

154
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,871
"but nothing has changed.

155
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:39,881
I'm standing now.

156
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,212
Grandpa

157
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,983
\Mll you bring your aunt?

158
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:52,792
I will.

159
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,990
He has promised me,
he will surely bring her.

160
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,462
"He is Bhagirata who brought
river Ganges to earth from the sky"

161
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:10,846
"He is Bhagirata who brought
river Ganges to earth from the sky"

162
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:15,110
"No one can stop him now."

163
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,781
"Here he goes."

164
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,514
"Hey you my people, the Lion is back."

165
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,456
"Back."

166
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,671
"Single Lion in the jungle."

167
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,307
"His name is Babbar Sher."

168
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,634
"He is Drona in aiming."

169
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,970
"His arrow never misses the target."

170
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,442
"Single Lion in the jungle."

171
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,345
"Number game he does not care."

172
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,111
"He is a friend forever."

173
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,820
"He is loyal."

174
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:56,223
"He is ready to face any consequence."

175
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,461
"He is a bonding for victory."

176
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:07,227
"He will make the enemy
scream and drive them mad."

177
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,135
"Hit out or get out."

178
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:14,302
"He is six feet cut out."

179
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,309
"Hit out or get out."

Welcome, sir.

It was earlier called as Bendakaluru.

214
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:12,684
Give that to me.
- Sir.

215
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,849
This is your aunt's recent photos.

216
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,861
Her name is Saraswami, but
she's more powerful than Goddess Durga

217
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,326
Sir, he's your uncle, it won't
be wrong if you call him dynamic

218
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,896
Now he has become soft as he
has experienced everything in life.

219
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,934
If I have to tell you about both of them,
your uncle is a lawyer in the court".

220
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,202
...and aunt is judge at home.

I know you know everything,
but don't try to impress me

223
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,346
Sir, I'll prepare for
what you tell me to do next.

224
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,779
Who knows what's next?
We'vejust landed.

225
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,280
Then.. - Had you known what's next,
would you be doing this job?

226
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,679
Sorry sir.
- Where's my aunt's house?

227
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,082
Sir, your aunt's house is in Jayanagan.

228
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:46,256
...but uncle just checked out
from Hyderabad and is walking there.

229
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,618
Who has come to receive?

Get me a vehicle.
- Sir, shall I get a chopper?

232
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,044
I want to go by road and not by air.

233
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:14,209
Okay, sir.

234
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,586
Excuse me, that's my car.

235
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,982
How much did you pay?
- 80 lakes.

236
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,220
N arayan..
- Sir?

237
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,048
Give him the money.

238
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,216
Hey, my car.

239
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,450
This is an American Express Exchequer.

240
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,729
...it is equal to cash. - Do I have
to give my car if you give me cash?

241
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:26,922
Do you want us to warn you too?

242
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,091
Taxi!

243
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:30,493
Thank you.

244
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,512
Sir? Sir..

245
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,687
Oh.

246
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,324
I think he's suffering from
heart attack. Call the paramedics.

247
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,861
If you wait for 10 minutes more,
he will die

248
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,329
Then your aunt will become a widow.
Think about it, sir.

249
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,490
Then she will have to do as you say,
what do you say, sir?

250
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,016
Mr. Chakrapani..

251
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,853
...l want some more
time to repay your debt.

252
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,789
Om Shakti,
how many more days would you need?

253
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,221
Is it after Kalbasva walks away?

254
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,829
Why are you staring at me with anger?

255
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,529
Even I have eyes.

256
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,563
Ifl drink a peg,
it will become redder than yours

257
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,866
I think you need to have some dignity

258
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:48,236
Om Shakti..

259
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,339
...when you came to me
asking for credit, you said..

260
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,040
...'Brother, give me so many crores'..

261
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:56,344
...'Brother, I want so much money'
with so much love talking in Kannada.

262
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,721
"But when we ask you to repay"

263
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,887
...you talk to me in English.

264
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,190
Madam, sir has been
admitted to John Hospital.

265
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,430
Madam, he has suffered an attack

266
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,598
One has to inform before leaving.

267
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,536
...but this madam left
without saying aword.

268
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,775
Oh Om ShaktL.

269
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,671
...why do you give debt
and get humiliated like this?

270
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,175
Let it be

271
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,881
I will fulfill my vow of Om Shakti..

272
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:31,218
...and then I will make
her cry on the right time.

273
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,981
Had you gone 2 kms ahead..

274
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,782
"There was another big hospital.

275
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,650
Why couldn't you take him there?
- Madam.

276
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,593
...2 kms ahead, there's a graveyard too.

277
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,624
When someone suffers a heart attack.

278
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,994
...he needs first treatment instead
of first class treatment.

279
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,130
You better thank him.

280
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,101
Sir, I thought she would fall at your
feet and thank you, but she's so arrogant.

281
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,642
Had she been so patient,
why would've she come here to take him?

282
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,450
Prakash?

283
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,761
Who got me admitted?

284
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,153
Swami.
- Madam?

285
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,691
There's a briefcase in my car,
tell the driver to get it here

286
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,295
Give 1 lake rupees to him.

287
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,699
Okay madam.
- To live with me..

288
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,867
...you left your wealth and money.

289
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,645
The one who saved my life..

290
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,142
"Would you just give
money to him, Sarsu?

291
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,851
The one who gave me life..

292
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,651
...and you let him
go without thanking him.

293
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,124
...even God won't forgive me.

294
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,027
Hello. He's calling you.

295
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,462
Sir, you have dialed my number.
- Receive

296
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,466
Listen what we talk inside

297
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,074
Okay sir. - If you miss anything,
then I'll hack you to pieces.

298
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:32,868
Okay, sir.

299
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:37,810
What's your name?

300
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,676
Give him these tablets.
- Okay, sir.

301
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:47,414
Okay.

302
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,423
I'm a driver, sir.
-Are you Kuber's driver?

303
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,655
The guy I am going to marry is in Dubai.

304
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,492
Sir, I was a driver
to a sheikh in Dubai..

305
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,529
...and now I quit that job and came here.
- Did you come on your own..

306
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,100
...or they sent you?
- They sent me, sir.

307
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,830
Why?
- Which case is that?

308
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,031
Sir, someone drowned.

309
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,333
Sir, actually.

310
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:10,104
Sir, in Dubai, Sheikh's wife was
drowning in water so I saved her.

311
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,714
So, he sent me back.

312
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,384
Dubai is a dessert.

313
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,111
Is there a beach in Dubai?

314
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,856
Swimming pool, sir.
- Why did he build a swimming pool?

315
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:21,887
To learn swimming, sir.

316
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,188
Forget that. Why did they send you back?

317
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:30,427
Sir, in Dubai,
only their husbands can touch"

318
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,869
...and see their women
I did both, so they sent me back.

319
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,431
Not just Dubai,
it's the same rule everywhere.

320
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,237
Sir, it is illegal.

321
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,602
According to the law, I shouldn't
stay there, so Dubai Sheikh..

322
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:46,378
"Gave me lots of
money and sent me back

323
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,916
He gave me lot of
money and sent me back

324
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,985
Why are you saying it again and again?

325
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,587
So that we both understand.

326
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,117
Look there.

327
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:55,782
Excuse me.

328
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,394
Just a minute. - What will you
get if you give this suitcase inside?

329
00:26:58,517 --> 00:26:59,587
"Why did you come so lame?"

330
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,923
They'll tell this dialogue to me.

331
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:04,158
If you give me the suitcase,
we'll give you car worth 80 lakes.

332
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,634
Here.

333
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,304
Why did you get it?

334
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,135
Where is our driver?

335
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:12,173
He said, "he prefers to be
a cleaner for car worth 80 lakes.

336
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,176
...but won't be a driver to a car
worth 60 lakes". So, he gave this to me.

337
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,136
Who are you?
- Patient from that bed.

338
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,747
Oh..

339
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,748
Oh Lord Narayana.

340
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,176
Sir, you can't beget children.

341
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,920
I already have a dozen children

342
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,853
He left work at the right time.

343
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:33,019
If you don't have any objection,
will you work for me?

344
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,027
Sir, I was very worried,
you are offering me ajoh

345
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,259
I will surely work for you.

346
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,098
You live a lavish life
and you say you are worried.

347
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,970
Madam, I don't think it is right to offer
him a job without knowing who he is.

348
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,142
Swami..
- Sorry, madam.

349
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,642
How much salary do you expect?

350
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,284
You'll have to print notes day and night
in Reserve Bank to give him salary.

351
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,817

King, shall I get you athrone
to sit and watch your dancers dance?

374
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:28,932
Okay.

375
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,805
What's the matter,
you are enjoying so much?

376
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,172
Sir, it is an.
There's nothing wrong seeing it.

377
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,041
Is it? Even I dance very well.
Bow down your head

378
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,274
Girls live in this house.
- Sir, please don't get me wrong.

379
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,615
Why do you beget girls and
then restrict guys from seeing them?

380
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:48,154
For example, God is valued
only if He's worshipped by people.

381
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,125
Girls are valued only if guys see them

382
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,285
One minute Can I help you?

383
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,621
Sure.
- What are you doing?

384
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,323
Are you out of your mind?

385
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,128
One goes out of their senses
at this age and even marry.

386
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,870
He will be happy with his wife, but the
girl will be sitting here and crying.

387
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,702
Here.

388
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,869
Is this correct?

389
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,008
Who is he?
-He is Chandu.

390
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,343
Nice meeting you, Chandu
- Same here - Stop it.

391
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,584
Madam, why do you want
to shake hands with the driver?

392
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:18,680
Hey, remember that your work
here is only to control the steering

393
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,254
That's okay, Chandu.

394
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,586
Madam you dance very well.

395
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,988
Thank you, thank you.

396
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,926
Salsa and Tap dance are
waste compared to your dance

397
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,701
Your hook like reverse Nike symbol.

398
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:37,929
...it flaps when you dance, and
if someone sees that, their heartbeat..

399
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,374
...will skip a beat for a minute
I guarantee that, madam

400
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,743
Are you really a driver?
- Sir has come from Dubai.

401
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,577
Madam, let's go.
- Oh

402
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,513
See you around.
- Sure

403
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,882
You have to keep
your eyes on the ground.

404
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,720
Here.
- What is this?

405
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:59,023
It is a bell. You should be
there until madam rings this twice.

406
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,699
Wham if she rings it third time?
- Then you won't be here.

407
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,899
Are you okay?
- Give me your hand. Pick me up.

408
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,373
Why? - Sir, I am a driver.
Don't shake hands with me

409
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,973
You won't stay here for long.

410
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,213
Let's see.
-All the best.

411
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,116
Everything is here according to the list..
- Okay.

412
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,587
That way..
- Thank you very much - Okay.

413
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,257
Swami, who is this?
- New driver.

414
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,920
Oh, are you the one who admitted
my brother to the hospital?

415
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,732
He has good height.
Looks like a basketball player.

416
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:39,996
We can get the tank cleaned
on the terrace without using ladder

417
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,302
Sir, what's the occasion?
You are dressed up like a priest.

418
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,967
All the ladies had vowed that they would
organize prayers if brother gets well..

419
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,580
...so they are here
- Oh, very good.

420
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,406
Give me the list, let me see.

421
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,677
This list is for veneration
and this list is for things.

422
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,285
Where's it?
- Snacks

423
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,585
It is in the room

424
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,129
What is it?
Do I look like a girl to you?

425
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,289
Why are you staring at me?
Go and get it.

426
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,968
Sir, where is it?
- It is there

427
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,967
Total, 9 plus 3 plus 22 plus 72..

428
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,301
No matter how much I exercise,
I don't get zero figure

429
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:32,212
"This is awesome"
- Thank you.

430
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:36,890
Wham happened?

431
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,323
Who sent him to my room?

432
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,827
Who told you to go to madam's room?

433
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,795
Sir, do you suffer from
short-term memory loss?

434
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,962
You sent me to the room to get snacks.

435
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,057
\Mll you go anywhere I point my hand at?

436
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,068
I'll point upwards,
will you go to the moon?

437
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,037
Why did you have to scream
Shame on you.

438
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,803
He made mistake,
why should I be ashamed?

439
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,505
You look decent,
how can you do such thing?

440
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,047
Madam, I know that unzipping is wrong.

441
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,842
"But I didn't know that
helping someone zip is wrong

442
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,853
If you are hurt, I will set it right.

443
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,479
How?
- Like this

444
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,853
You are unzipping a girl's dress,
you are Dushassan.

445
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,691
Sir, listen to me.. - Come with me.
- Doesn't he have senses?

446
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,400
Swami, what's the matter?
- Sir actually...

447
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:26,236
Your second daughter Rukku, her gown,
her zip. I can't say it.

448
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,537
Sir, he shouldn't stay here.
He doesn't know where the snacks are

449
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,839
Swami, he knows where my guts are

450
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:36,180
Brother, listen to me
- Brother; throw him out.

451
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,187
Listen to me - If he's here,
we'll lose our dignity. Send him.

452
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,553
Sir, no matter what,
he shouldn't stay in this house -Yes.

453
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,092
Who do we keep in this
house and whom we don't.

454
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,955
...Saraswati knows very well.
She will decide

455
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,108
Get the tank full.

456
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,624
Hi, hello.

457
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:22,163
Who are you?
- I am nurse Lakshmi.

458
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:25,565
Lakshmi Narayana.
- 'Ne thought nurse would be a woman".

459
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,000
"But you are here

460
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:32,438
Many nurses who we had sent
to serve people have returned pregnant.

461
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:33,669
So, I came here.

462
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,302
Why? Are you upset?
- No. - Listen.

463
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,641
Take this.
- Thank you.

464
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:43,682
Oh no. Aunt, you should store
oil in a can and not in fritters.

465
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,917
Look, you should use
olive oil for cooking.

466
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:50,118
You have to make an
omelet using egg whites.

467
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,593
You shouldn't miss out
beetroot at any cost for lunch.

468
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,756
Because it is very good for heart.
- Okay; what will you eat?

469
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:57,827
Whatever I told was for me

470
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,169
I don't know what the patient
likes to eat. Go and ask him.

471
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,102
Funny guys They think I am the doctor.

472
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,348
Wham style? Move your hand.

473
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:16,181
Are you big boss? Move your leg.

474
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,187
Are you a hero?

475
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:23,826
Hey, you don't even have the
minimum body language like a driver.

476
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,492
Other than screwdriver,
all the drivers are here.

477
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,800
I didn't ask body, but body language.

478
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,495
Sir, I've brought one show reel.

479
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,041
Sir, Dr. Rajkumar as a lorry driver.

480
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:50,816
'This lorry doesn't take lives,
but gives lives.'

481
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,820
'What's the name of the dog?'

482
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,259
Dr. Vishnuvardhan as bus driver,
in the movie 'Suryavamsham'.

483
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,659
'Look...
- Hey, why are screaming?'

484
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,031
'Did I run into you intentionally?'

485
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:08,035
'You came speeding
and rammed into my car.'

486
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,434
Double star, Mr. Ambrish.

487
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,098
He doesn't wear uniform.
He has a different style.

488
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,500
I can see that.
- 'You always act...'

489
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,443
"Move aside, brother is coming"

490
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,184
Sir, he looks like you
He is Ranga SSLC..

491
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,412
His name is Kiccha

492
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,352
Huccha (mad)?
- Sir, you can think that too.

493
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,093
Do you want me to follow that mad?

494
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:34,026
I should be commanding you and not you.

495
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,224
Sir, what do you want me to do?
- Nothing. Just get me an ice-pack.

496
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:36,731
Okay.

497
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,860
My bad luck that a clown
like you is working for me.

498
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,897
Sir... is there any development
in your aunt's case?

499
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:47,073
If Prakash would drink
daily and hit my aunt.

500
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,470
My aunt would be crying and want to go to
her mother's house, that's development.

501
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,377
But he is taking care
of her like a queen here.

502
00:37:57,175 --> 00:38:00,486
There won't be any development.
- Whether or not you get your salary..

503
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,819
"But your aunt will
never come back for sure.

504
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,992
Sir, please leave me. I beg of you.

505
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,566
Nani.
- Sir?

506
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,567
My uncle is back from the hospital..

507
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,434
"But when he knows why we are here..

508
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,335
"Won't he go back to
the hospital again? -Yes, sir.

509
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,431
Is it?
- Yes.

510
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:22,011
\Mll aunt take me into the house?
- No chance, sir.

511
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,307
Now, why have we come here?

512
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:29,178
To fulfill our aim, we should
get into that house, right? -Yes sir.

513
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,112
Is there any better
route than the driver?

514
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:32,847
No way, sir.
- Sir, please put me down.

515
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,288
I can't bear it any longer.
- Look, Muneen.

516
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:40,352
...if you fight with me in anger,
then I will fight like 'Veer Madakari'.

517
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,122
Yes sir.

518
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,426
If you fight with me with love,
I will surrender to you like Nandi.

519
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,092
Sir, this dialogue doesn't
suit this situation.

520
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,864
You should be in ajungle,
but you are wearing a suit.

521
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,165
Should I remove it?
- No, sir.

522
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,041
You shouldn't question me.
- Okay sir.

523
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,839
What did I say?
- I shouldn't question you.

524
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,538
He is so haughty.

525
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,122
Sir, these are the documents required
for Saraswati's college admission

526
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,689
This is scholarship form,
this is latest bank statement.

527
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:14,663
She hasn't told which
subject she will select.

528
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,290
Let she select whichever she likes
- Dad, I've already selected

529
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:23,804
Why are you getting tensed?

530
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,568
I didn't murder anyone

531
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,039
I just got married.

532
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:32,146
Dad, he is Prakash. He's done ML.

533
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:36,415
He said, he would die
ifl didn't marry him.

534
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,846
I told him that he would die
even if he marries me

535
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,423
He didn't listen to me
So, I got married to him.

536
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,882
He was scared that you
wouldn't accept him as..

537
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,691
He was scared that you
wouldn't accept him as..

538
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:47,559
...your son-in-law as
he is poor and we are rich.

539
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,388
I told him not to worry..

540
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,899
...as my dad loves me very much,
he will surely accept you

541
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,333
Not only that, you would've
even told him that..

542
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,929
"My dad is a fool and
wouldn't do anything.

543
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,905
I used to disguise as a clown to make
you laugh when you were young..

544
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,567
"But you made me a real joker today.

545
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:05,004
What did you say? 'Just married'?

546
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,679
I thought I would send you to Oxford for
higher education and give you my office..

547
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,608
"But you got married to him

548
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:14,418
I am organizing a veneration for your
well-being, but you've ruined my peace

549
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,751
Dad.
- Cut it out! Who is your dad?

550
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,530
Dad, I was very sure that you would
accept my marriage So, I married him.

551
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:25,129
If you had trust on me, you wouldn't
have come with garlands in your hand..

552
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,301
...you would've come without it.

553
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,536
Had you asked my permission,
I would've refused.

554
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,041
You would cry, but I wouldn't give in.

555
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:34,908
One year,
two year; three years, four years.

556
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,446
...or even many, you would've
waited had you had trust on me.

557
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:42,216
He doesn't have status
even to carry my company files.

558
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:45,811
Dad, I see future with him.

559
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,790
I can see a good family.
- But I can see your ruination.

560
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,255
Had you died,
I would've cried for one day..

561
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,931
"But you will make me cry every day.

562
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,997
Out! Get out!

563
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,965
Sharat, listen to what she says

564
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,397
Because of you, he is advising me

565
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:09,103
Hey Sharam!
- Out! Get out! - Dad, please don't.

566
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,912
Listen to me, dad.
- Out!

567
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,149
Dad, what are you doing?
- Don't stop me.

568
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,947
Even her shadow shouldn't be here

569
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,285
Don't put wood to light fire,
but put her things

570
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:27,520
She snatched my smile,
I shouldn't listen her laugh again.

571
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,834
Good morning, sir.

572
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,550
Sir, it is diny here.
- "It is about the waist.."

573
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,657
What is he doing here?
-I think he saw you.

574
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,320
Wham do you say?
-I will teach him a lesson.

575
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,623
Nani, we have to bear the consequences.
Let's tell him the truth.

576
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:06,493
Hope he understands.
- Excuse me, move aside.

577
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:10,032
Hey, what are you doing here?
Who are they?

578
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,805
Lakshmi, I am not a driver,
but Saraswafls nephew.

579
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,507
I own an iron plant company in Spain.

580
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,973
My aunt got married
against grandpa's wishes.

581
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,650
I'm here to take her back with me.

582
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,086
You like her elder daughter Indra,
you wish to marry her, right?

583
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,684
Listen, come here.
Even I am not a nurse

584
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,487
My father owns an iron shop in foreign.

585
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:39,035
My father iron clothes of American
President to London Queen, governor.

586
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,227
I like her second daughter Rukmini,
sol have come to this house.

587
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,841
Oh what an irony.
- What?

588
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,368
Coincidence. - If you both
become sons-in-law of that house..

589
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:51,072
...like Johnson and Johnson,
you'll get a name as Iron and Iron.

590
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:53,574
Your name is much better than the girls.

591
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:56,914
Extraordinary. - Shut up.
Don't fool me saying iron and steel.

592
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,015
He wouldn't have got a bus
and you would've dropped him here

593
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,783
He is standing here and
watching an aunt sweeping..

594
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,082
...he is giving built up
and there's a band set team

595
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,626
Hey, you are getting lame for work.
Come on.

596
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,524
He says, she is his aunt.
- Sir, he just walked away.

597
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,594
Come here

598
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,125
Nani, truth is like coconut
and lies are like cool drinks.

599
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:15,927
Cool drinks are sold more in our
country. Our bad luck. We can't help.

600
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,131
Oh, I'm getting late for my duty.
lfl go late, they'll deduct my salary.

601
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,477
Morning, ma'am.

602
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,886
Actually... I am sorry about yesterday.

603
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,588
Actually accountant
Swami misguided me, if not..

604
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,215
You?
- I'm driver Chandu.

605
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:41,991
Look Chandu, if this chair is broken,
then will someone plan to..

606
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,401
...click a picture of it,
frame it and watch it daily..

607
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,503
...to teach the chair a lesson?

608
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:51,468
You can sit on a chain.

609
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:53,837
"But you can't take revenge from it.
- Right?

610
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,342
You are the same for me

611
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,979
For me chair,
table, driver, servants, all are equal.

612
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,675
I don't think about them at all.

613
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,352
Go and do your work.

614
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,327
Go.

615
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,302
Aunt, there's no water in the geyser.

616
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,937
Geyser has to be repaired.

617
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,870
I want hot water to have bath

618
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,498
It is ready. You come here and take it.

619
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:27,804
I am wearing a towel.

620
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,640
Even are busy working.

621
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:32,806
I should've at least got married.

622
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,941
My husband would've
brought water in a bucket.

623
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:40,153
Hey, why did you come here?

624
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,491
They had kept the bucket downstairs

625
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:45,818
Sir has told me to do all the work.

626
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:49,228
You look like a thief. My father
made a mistake by appointing you.

627
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:51,494
Actually, I am like a 3D picture.

628
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,629
You can't see me
clearly from naked eyes.

629
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:58,070
If you see me through the glasses,
you can see this cut out clearly.

630
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,900
Don't you have common sense that
you shouldn't go in a girl's bathroom?

631
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,239
Madam, the pipe, the bucket,"

632
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,904
...brush is watching you have bath.

633
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,210
I am just a driver.
You said it yourself.

634
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,149
You do one thing,
I will stand here, you go and have bath.

635
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,846
If you run out of water,
I'll get one more bucket for you.

636
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:15,914
Are you challenging me? I will have
bath. VWII you watch? - Look madam.

637
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,990
...you can have bath in front of me..

638
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:22,087
"But I am not interested
in seeing men taking bath.

639
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,002
You stay healthy. How did this happen?

640
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,538
I was feeling uneasy since afternoon.

641
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,839
"Moreover, I was travelling.

642
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,035
I had chest pain.

643
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,343
I thought it was gastric
problem and drank Eno.

644
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:43,049
While I was driving, I had severe pain.

645
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,054
My vision was blurring.
I felt I was dying.

646
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:53,259
I was not able to do anything
I was thinking whether to scold God..

647
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:57,560
...or pray to him to give me a life.
I couldn't know.

648
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,629
Life passed with the speed of light.

649
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,072
"Then I thought.

650
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,873
"Wife, children, brothers and family.

651
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,809
...l am going to miss everyone

652
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,278
None of my children have got married..

653
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,772
...and I am going to die

654
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:19,150
When you wait for something,
you know the value of time"

655
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:24,551
...when you are dying,
you know the value of relationships

656
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,223
It is true If not for me.

657
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,795
...l thought I should live for my family.

658
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,239
Then came my savior.

659
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,169
He broke the glass, called the ambulance,
and got me admitted in the hospital..

660
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,944
...he saved my life.

661
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:53,149
Thank you. Wham else do I tell you?

662
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:58,087
Had my mother been alive,
she would've a built a temple for you.

663
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:01,997
Mom, what would've
your family members done?

664
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,292
I don't have a family. Everyone died.

665
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:22,142
"There's garden everywhere,
but monkeys are troubling"

666
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,015
"I am short."

667
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,124
Listen, there's a small
shop in the next lane.

668
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,784
...if uncle is in the shop,
tell him my name and get two cigarettes.

669
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,393
If aunt is in the shop,
tell her to give one packet.

670
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,725
You take sweets for yourself.

671
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,565
Oh! If you want cigarette, buy it.

672
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:44,399
You can take coffee or tea if you want.

673
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,507
I have servants to serve me tea..

674
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,978
...and wash my hands
why should I drink tea in your name?

675
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,979
Oh god!
Sir, I said it..

676
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,018
Sir, listen to me.
- I have servants to do all my work.

677
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,418
...and you tell me to do your work?

678
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,578
What is that?

679
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,188
What is that?
- Coffee shop.

680
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,816
Was it here yesterday?
- No, sir.

681
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,555
Whether I drink American coffee,
filter coffee, or black coffee.

682
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:11,827
...even I don't know, but they know it.
- Sir, I made a mistake

683
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,228
Come here

684
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,065
When they tell me to buy vegetables,
I don't know how to get them..

685
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:20,437
...so, they've put up a stall here
to pack it and give it to me

686
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:24,909
Sir... -You tell me to work.. - Sir...
- Come with me. Come Look there

687
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,579
Look there!
- Yes, sir.

688
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:29,275
I don't know which car is
filled with diesel..

689
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,943
...and which with petrol,
but they do it for me.

690
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,520
For me to act as a driven.

691
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,614
...so many of them are working for me,
but you are telling me to work

692
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,220
Sir, I didn't know about you

693
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:42,890
Sir, you tell me, can anyone recognize
someone with clothes and cell phone?

694
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,928
Lakshmi, you can't order anyone to work.

695
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,731
Sir, but I can orders others, right?

696
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,873
No, sir.. No sir..
-You! -No, sir.

697
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:56,711
Sir, they are here
We are paying salary to them, sir.

698
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,379
Boys!

699
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:04,810
Sir, tell them not to hit me.
Please sir. They are hitting me.

700
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,915
Nani. - Sir. - Did you realize
that I don't get angry like before?

701
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:11,288
You are right, sir.

702
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,396
Earlier; you threatened people with
gun but now, you talk to them politely.

703
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:17,329
I guess if you give up your anger even
more, you will become really very polite

704
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,459
Ye; sir. He is absolutely right.
- Do one thing. -Yes, sir.

705
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,134
Give him some money.
- Okay.

706
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,898
Give me.

707
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,071
Give him everything.

708
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,405
It's 10 lakes, he will be shocked.
- Narayan.

709
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,475
Okay, sir.
- Oh my god.

710
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,414
I'm not upset for
getting beaten up, sir.

711
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:36,246
Okay, go.
- I don't mind getting beaten again.

712
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,916
Sir, the key.

713
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:44,925
K6?'-

714
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:47,018
Give it. - Are you going
to open it for me, sir?

715
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,023
People rob banks in
Bangalore sitting in America.

716
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,863
...but when others are given 10 lakes,
they ask for key:.

717
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,835
He is laughing.
One needs key, isn't it? Idiot.

718
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:02,968
Nani. - Sir. -You are right.
If he sees so much money..

719
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,044
...he will be shocked, so..

720
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:08,549
Nani sir, that one?

721
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,516
You're lucky to get so much money.
Take it and enjoy yourself.

722
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,188
10 lakes..
- You won't get even than.

723
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:15,620
Alright, I will go.

724
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:27,358
I thought the owner of
the hotel would be an old man..

725
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,131
"But she is so young, isn't she?

726
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,874
The debtor is happy when he gets money..

727
00:50:33,097 --> 00:50:36,704
"But the creditor should always worry.

728
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:39,838
I said I will repay the money.
- But how?

729
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:42,918
We are getting tied
up with a software company.

730
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,884
...ifthe deal is okay, we will
get minimum 40 percent occupancy.

731
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,149
It won't happen. Simple

732
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,356
I will raid your hotel tomorrow itself"

733
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,395
"arrest the call girls..

734
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,554
...and your contract will get canceled.
That's it.

735
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,256
Think about it.

736
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,660
If you put your finger into a baby's
mouth which doesn't have teeth.

737
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,067
...it will still try to bite you..

738
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:05,035
"But though you troubled me so much,
I did nothing to you.

739
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,102
I was quiet.

740
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,410
Look, I will let go the loan money..

741
00:51:11,102 --> 00:51:13,548
...l will also give 25 lakes extra.

742
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:17,011
...tell her to give
away the hotel to me.

743
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,351
...the problem will get solved.

744
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:24,385
I think he is right.
- He is very spiritual.

745
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:30,262
Even the coconut prices have gone up,
rather than offering it to God.

746
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:32,862
...he might even break
it on your husband's head.

747
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:34,766
Try to understand

748
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:37,634
When we get upset with God Himself
when He doesn't fulfill our wish..

749
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:43,235
...how will we spare human beings when
they don't give back what they owe us?

750
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,905
"They call him Ranna He is gold"

751
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:18,279
'No one to match him"

752
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:21,578
I don't know who you are and
what happened here. I will find out..

753
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:24,683
"But seeing her upset
when she was leaving..

754
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,754
...l'm sure something wrong has happened

755
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:29,120
He)', who are you?

756
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,190
Her driver.
- What's the need to talk to the driver?

757
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,030
Throw him out.

758
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,703
"Ranna"

759
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:28,575
How dare you create scene before police?
I will shoot you.

760
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,845
The person who does
wrong will fear the police.

761
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,547
...and the one who fears
death will fear for gun..

762
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:37,718
...l don't fear anyone. - If you thrash
goons you think you are a warrior?

763
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:42,158
I have become a politician
by fooling thousands of people

764
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:45,257
The home minister and
I play cards every day.

765
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,660
State or central? Narayan.
- Sir.

766
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:48,896
Did you hear that? -Yes.

767
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:49,936
Are you threatening me?

768
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,904
I have seen many
men like you in my life.

769
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,705
I'm old too, it's just that
I have dyed my hair, that's all.

770
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,904
Done, sir.

771
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,344
Hello.

772
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:08,521
Put it down Put the gun down.

773
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,091
Sir, sorry.

774
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:12,421
I didn't know he was such a lowly man.

775
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,857
Wham happened?

776
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,522
What happened? Don't you know the
difference between bicycle and bullet?

777
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,062
It was home minister from Delhi.

778
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:20,362
He is abusing me having Kannada
dictionary so that I understand.

779
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,595
You idiot.
What are you looking at? Film?

780
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:28,138
He will create earthquake
and Tsunami. Get out.

781
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,914
Sir, is my post still there?
- I will tell you, come.

782
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,626
You expect her to sell
the hotel because you want it?

783
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:50,055
Otherwise, you will kill her?
I'm there to save her..

784
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,400
"But who will save you from me?

785
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,769
Come here

786
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:01,967
Kneel down before me.

787
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:15,079
You will give back the
documents to her in half-an-hour.

788
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:17,457
Othenmise..
- Please don't say a word.

789
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:21,018
You will kill me.
- That's right.

790
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:22,830
Take paper and pen

791
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:27,691

For the mistake I made.

799
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:49,782
Wham happened?

800
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,692
Half-an-hour back I threatened
you to sell your hotel to me..

801
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:57,631
"Now, I regret for whatever I did..

802
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,961
...hence I'm giving it back to you.

803
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:02,663
How did you change your
mind all of a sudden? - Mister".

804
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:06,739
...you didn't ask me a single question that
day when I took away the hotel from you..

805
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,903
...now when I'm giving it back,
why are you asking me so many questions.

806
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:13,179
Isn't there value for good people?

807
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:20,179
There is a power
which is protecting you.

808
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:24,715
It is not easy to confront it.

809
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,026
It is not easy to overpower it.

810
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,896
Please pay your visit.
I will take your leave

811
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,513
Look, mom

812
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,553
We must convince
her at any cost. - Okay.

813
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,220
Mummy!

814
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,528
Where are you going?
- Party..

815
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,098
We had told you about it.

816
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:09,032
Mom, what's this.
- Mummy, what are you doing?

817
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,697
The line should not be seen.
- Shall I wipe it, mummy?

818
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:17,472
Naughty I mean,
you must wear clothes till there

00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:23,142
What? Party, mummy. - Only if you cover
that line, I will open the door for you

820
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:26,213
Chandu! Come!

821
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,256
Where to, madam?
- Friday night.

00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:30,621
Oh god. Party?

823
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:33,092
I have been waiting for you.

824
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,787
Mother told us to change dresses.

825
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,956
I'm sorry.
- Don't say sorry please. It's okay.

826
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:41,331
Then come, let's go.

00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:47,938
Come

You changed your dress
while telling me the address?

829
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:52,480
If you talk too much, I will change you.

830
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,513
Wham.
- Why are you talking like that?

831
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:58,017
You are right, madam.
- Chandu, have food and wait in the car.

832
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:01,355
Please go.
- Let's go.

833
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:39,727
Hi.

834
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:46,327
Hi. - Hi.
-Are you single?

835
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,029
Excuse me?
-You have come alone

836
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,134
I have come here looking for someone

837
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,900
ls it me?

838
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,478
Hey Rukku, Chandu.

839
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:01,413
I'm looking for Rukku.
- I think he is looking for us.

840
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:05,816
Be quiet. He deserves it.
- Am I not beautiful?

841
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:09,482
You are beautiful"
- What's your name? - Chandu.

842
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,723
Chandu

843
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:16,354
Why are you here? - Look, I'm not
the kind of guy you think I am.

844
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:19,923
You mean, I am bad girl?
- Not at all, madam

845
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,833
Take it.

846
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,335
This one is more bitter, madam.

847
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,446
Vokda Why? Shall I order for milk?

848
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,018
I made a mistake again.

So you smoke cigarette too.

893
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,164
I will complain to mother.

894
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,137
Silly girl.

895
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,372
'Ne had been for a party recently.

896
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:28,671
Yes

897
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,536
You wore a decent dress
when you left home..

898
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:32,738
...and changed it when
you got down from the can.

899
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,076
...and your mom is unaware
of it, am I right? -Yes.

900
01:04:35,572 --> 01:04:36,744
Now, I will tell you a story, come.

901
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,012
A girl finds a genie lamp.

902
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,411
Genie lamp, when rubbed genie comes out.

903
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,047
As soon as he came out,
he said 'I will give you three wishes..

904
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,158
"But on one condition'.

905
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,258
He said whatever I grant you..

906
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,522
...l will grant the same to your
husband but ten times more.

907
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,092
...and she agreed.

908
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:53,859
When he asked her first wish,
she said I want a big house

909
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:57,364
Okay, he gave her a house and her
husband was given ten times bigger house.

910
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,539
When she asked her second wish,
she said I want plenty of money..

911
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:03,605
...so obviously the husband
was given ten times more of the amount.

912
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:06,207
When he asked for her third wish
it is very important, pay attention

913
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,213
When he asked for her third wish.

914
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:11,013
...she said 'give me
a minor heart attack'.

915
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,748
What do you think would've happened?

916
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,722
Her husband would've then would've
suffered a major heart attack.

917
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:18,016
So brilliant, isn't it?

918
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:24,528
This is where girls prove
they are dimwits trying to act smart.

919
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:27,761
Actually, the husband suffered
ten minor heart attacks

920
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,375
Look, you must come.

921
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:38,611
No other option.

922
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:42,575
Do you know him?
- No.

923
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,721
Oh, it might hurt, Chandu.

924
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:52,649
Ms. lndu,
we hit so that the enemy gets hurt.

925
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,728
No, I mean, you might get hurt.

926
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:57,458
Driver!

927
01:05:59,256 --> 01:05:59,825
Chandu!

928
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:01,628
Come

929
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:05,804
Drivers are human beings too.
Call me by my name.

930
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:10,334
Boys, don't repeat it again, okay?

931
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:12,806
Please come, come.

932
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:30,997
Come!

933
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,367
Come on!

934
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,446
Hey, go and beat him!

935
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,147
"Feel the power of Ranna."

936
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:34,827
Chandu!

937
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:06,886
Go bring your sister.

938
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,693
He is beside her, Chandu

939
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:16,193
All these girls know is to cry
when threatened or threaten by crying.

940
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,040
So what if he is beside her,
I'm with you, madam.

941
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:21,640
Go bring her, go.

942
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:22,768
Go.

943
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:30,375
Who were they?

944
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:33,586
I don't know, daddy.
-\Mll you be able to identify them?

945
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:36,415
Brother, lodge a police complaint.

946
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:38,320
Yes brother, they shouldn't be spared

947
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:41,995
Being a father, even I want
to lodge a police complaint.

948
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:43,764
"But as alawyen.

949
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,500
...fighting the case in
the court isn't a child's game

950
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:49,604
Let's not do investigation
during the time of giving invitation

951
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:53,137
Correct, sir.
It is better to ignore such incidents.

952
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:57,475
There is no need to felicitate
Chandu because he helped you again.

953
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,738
Where is Chandu? ls he alright?

954
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:02,016
It was he who thrashed them.
What will happen to him?

955
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:03,276
God bless him

956
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,616
He saved my daughter
for the second time.

957
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,285
Send for the doctor,
let's talk about marriage alliance

958
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:10,014
Okay, brother:

959
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,310
In angen.

960
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:42,047
...my father also used
to beat the wall with a stick..

961
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:47,651
...and my brother used to mock me.

962
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:49,963
...since I did the same

963
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:54,334
He had a son, very mischievous.

964
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:58,038
When a driver is asked
to fill petrol in the car..

965
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:01,066
...he won't go without
taking money and keys

966
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,808
It's the only thing he doesn't know.

967
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,007
Your father and l..

968
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,741
"Grew up together for 20 years

I see your father in your face.

970
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:17,082
...and I hear your grandpa in your talks

971
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:20,418
You think I won't know even that much?

972
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,256
I'm not cruel like your grandpa.

973
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:30,731
He can oust his daughter
from his house.

974
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:34,840
"But I can't oust
my driver out of my house..

975
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:37,238
"That's why you
are still in this house

976

He shot my husband..

...l will come to their
house as soon as you call me?

'Other than this,
what else can you do, daddy?'

980
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:59,626
'Father, calm down What are you doing?'

981
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,429
'Father.. -I bought
this gun for self-defense..

982
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,733
...but dignity is more
important than life.'

983
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:06,039
'Father, don't!'

984
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:07,875
'Father, don't!'

'Oh no! Prakash!'

...l thought you would endure
everything for me, daddy.'

992
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,261
'You killed me there"

993
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,396
...here, you died yourself.'

994
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:38,428
'The fire there will turn off..

995
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,167
"But the fire that you have lit here.

996

You staying in this house..

"Won't make any difference to me.

1004
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:09,833
But one thing"

1005
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:14,673
...you came to our house
and saved my husband.

1006

...if all this really
happened then it's okay"

1008

"but if you did all this on purpose.

...l never miss my
target like your grandpa

1013
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:16,699
Sir.

1014
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,075
Sir, before you finish the
coffee and keep the cup on the table.

1015

Kidnap, sir. Yes sir.

Like Havana kidnapped Sta,
let's kidnap your aunt.

1018
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,915
You uncle Prakash won't
come looking like Lord Ram did..

1019
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:42,190
...even if he came, who will
come for the rescue like Lord Anjenaya?

1020
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:43,587
Come here
- Sir.

1021
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,798
Get out of my sight! Go!

1022
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:51,429
Sir, you don't beam. - Hey.

1023
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:53,930
Don't tell me something that
makes me angry. Tell me what is it?

1024
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:57,642
Except your aunt, nobody knows
that you are her nephew, do they?

1025
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:01,145
Nobody knows and she
won't tell anyone too, Nani.

1026
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,444
Take advantage of it and..

1027
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,710
Nani, come to the point.

1028
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,044
Say I love you to Indra

1029
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:12,551
lfl say I love you to Indra,
will she say I love you too?

1030
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,220
What if she says I hate you?

1031
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:16,891
Sir, let me tell you something.

1032
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:18,757
What? -You are the
most eligible bachelor, sir.

1033
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:22,598
Girls go crazy just
by seeing your height, sir.

1034
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,764
Hearing your voice.

1035
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,100
"They will go crazier, sir.

1036
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:30,307
Although girls have married other men..

1037
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:31,912
...they have always
been in love with you, sir.

1038
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:33,279
Yes sir.
- Really?

1039
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:34,347
Yes sir.
- Come here.

1040
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,246
Are you sure?
- Sure, sir.

1041
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,649
Are they crazy about me?
- Yes, sir.

1042
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,117
Continue Come on, continue

1043
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,682
Sir, just for once.

1044
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:45,992
...for once.

1045
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,587
...call out 'Indra'.

1046
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,153
Indra

1047
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,759
Like a passenger chases a running bus.

1048
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:55,195
...she will chase you, sir.
- Really?

1049
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:58,202
Then? - Your aunt will
then follow her, sir.

1050
01:14:58,694 --> 01:14:59,695
Madam.

1051
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:04,302
...l have seen her watch
you with so much love in her eyes.

1052
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:06,009
Really?

1053
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:07,681
She is fond of you.

1054
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:09,277
Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:10,282
Yes sir.

1056
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:11,351
Shall I tell her?
- Yes, sir.

1057
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,111
Shall I tell her?
- Yes, sir.

1058
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:14,181
I'm going to tell her.

1059
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:15,981
Are you sure?
- Sure, sir.

1060
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:17,680
Shall I tell her?
- Yes, sir.

1061
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:18,958
Sure, sir. Okay.

1062
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:28,962
Madam!

1063
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,502
Wham are you doing?
- Don't stop me!

1064
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,864
Wait a minute, madam? You want to die?

1065
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,306
Why should I be alive
when I don't get what I want?

1066
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,706
I think she found out.

1067
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:45,185
Look, the thing that
you like is always yours

1068
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:45,911
Not mine.

1069
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:51,186
I think she is very upset.

1070
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,861
Look, actually, I'm a driver.

1071
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,862
Yes not a driver, you are a dacoit.

1072
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,191
You are a villain who
separated me from my lover.

1073
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:05,032
\Mll you tell me who
you are in love with?

1074
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,370
Rohit, the guy you hit in the mall.

1075
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:21,948
That's unfair, madam
- What do you mean?

1076
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:24,054
He actually kidnapped you, didn't he?

1077
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:26,593
Had he kidnapped me, won't I scream?

1078
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:29,858
We've been dating each
other past three years

1079
01:16:30,553 --> 01:16:32,533
We also planned to
elope and get married..

1080
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:34,929
"But you came and ruined everything.

1081
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:38,370
L.. - He is getting
married tomorrow night.

1082
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:40,569
Tomorrow?

1083
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,302
I will bring him in the morning.
Don't worry.

1084
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:44,934
Hello, it's not so easy.

1085
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,444
<i>'Rom Naik weds Neehnveri Dodmaxfl.'</i>

1086
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:49,878
Notjust Dodmani, Veerappa Dodmani.

1087
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,750
He is a big shot in the city.

1088
01:16:52,308 --> 01:16:53,446
He has two sons..

1089
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:54,584
...and one daughter'.

1090
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:56,548
They are getting her married to Rohit.

1091
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:59,226
He loves his daughter very much.

1092
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,988
Once a guy had only touched
his daughter's hand.

1093
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,628
"They chopped his hand.

1094
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,007
\Mll you still bring him?

1095
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,243
VWII you go right away?

1096
01:17:32,215 --> 01:17:33,250
All the best.
- Bye.

1097
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,630
"The wedding bond."

1098
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:38,427
Super.
- "Last forever."

1099
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:39,192
Sir, did you see?

1100
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:41,158
The song matches the situation.

1101
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,331
Oh my god!

1102
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:45,764
Oh no.

1103
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,532
Change the song. Park the flight.

1104
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:49,999
Take me to the hospital.

1105
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,376
Him? I mean..

1106
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:53,607
Him?

1107
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:55,277
He is handsome

1108
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,382
He is more handsome.

1109
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,713
The day he clicked this photo,
the camera wasn't working properly.

1110
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:02,515
Darn it.

1111
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:03,555
What?

1112
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,017
Nothing.

1113
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,960
She believes he is handsome

1114
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:11,326
What is he doing here?

1115
01:18:12,221 --> 01:18:14,531
Someone wants to go to Hubli..

1116
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:17,067
...l will take him to the
address and come back in flight.

1117
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:18,202
Okay, bye-

1118
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,832
On seeing them both"

1119
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:24,239
...l think they are trying
to escape after robbing something

1120
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,140
I will inform mother.

1121
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:25,844
Mummy!

1122
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,408
Did the tyre burst?

1123
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:33,485
Is it ghost"?

1124
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:48,527
I think the sun rises just to burn us.

1125
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:49,496
So hot.

1126
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,663
How did she even fall in love with him?

1127
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:54,901
He looks like a terrorist. Darn it.

1128
01:18:55,264 --> 01:18:59,337
Sir, in the current generation, very few
people fall in love seeing character

1129
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,104
Boys fall for girls
seeing their beauty"

1130
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:03,110
...and girls fall for
boys because they are rich

1131
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:04,751
For instance, this very family.

1132
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:05,952
First daughter is good..

1133
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:07,750
"But the second daughter;

1134
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:09,788
...she is decent at home
and mischievous outside.

1135
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,782
Why are you laughing?

1136
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:17,222
So you know her better than me?

1137
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:19,123
You naughty boy.

1138
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,434
Hi.
- Hi?

1139
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:22,898
0h god!

1140
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,130
Please stop!

1141
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:37,945
Do we have to come all the
way from here to get here, sir?

1142
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,051
Sir?

1143
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:40,879
Sir?

1144
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:42,912
Has she gone mad?

1145
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,223
Shall we go, madam?

1146
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:45,656
Hanumanta!

1147
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:46,916
Three fried rice!

1148
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:48,619
Please give me ice, it's burning.

1149
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:49,761
Okay, sir.
- Lakshmi.

1150
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:50,759
Make fried rice

1151
01:19:50,853 --> 01:19:51,627
How did she get here?

1152
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:53,625
I have no idea, boss

1153
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,992
I think she suffers from sleepwalking

1154
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,570
She must've fallen
into the jeep last night..

1155
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,436
...and hit her head and
had temporary memory loss

1156
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,234
The medical term for it is Malaysia

1157
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,439
Idiot, you are wrong

1158
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,108
It is called amnesia

1159
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:10,013
Did they change the name?

1160
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:11,315
Yes
- Excuse me

1161
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,951
Why are we here?

1162
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,111
Actually, you are my aunt's daughter:

1163
01:20:16,512 --> 01:20:17,957
Our families are not in good terms

1164
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,454
We tried hard to convince
our families to get us both married..

1165
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:22,491
"But they didn't agree.

1166
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:24,523
...hence we have eloped.

1167
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,495
They are crying--

1168
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:27,831
"don't add onion.

1169
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:29,627
Don't I have sisters?

1170
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,204
You do have, the witch.

1171
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,834
She is a real witch.

1172
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:35,636
It was she who exposed
us before your parents

1173
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,439
They are crying more..

1174
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:38,438
"Don't add lemon juice.

1175
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:40,510
Who is he?
- You are injured..

1176
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:43,117
...he is a doctor.

1177
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,142
Ayurvedic..
- Ayurvedic doctor.

1178
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:46,311
He said Ayurveda.

1179
01:20:46,809 --> 01:20:48,311
...don't add coriander and curry leaves

1180
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,186
Why is my sister against our marriage?

1181
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:53,792
It's a big story. Since you're asking,
I will tell you the truth.

1182
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:57,864
A rich guy betrayed
your sister in love..

1183
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,159
Even I am a rich guy.

1184
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,860
He is boasting himself so much.

1185
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:05,068
So cancel their order.

1186
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,198
For a fool, everyone looks crazy.

1187
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,844
Though she is in trouble,
she doesn't miss saying proverb.

1188
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:12,913
Lakshmi..
- What is this?

1189
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,408
Cancel the juice too.

1190
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:15,475
Cousin.

1191
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,480
Boss control yourself.

1192
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:20,518
You are my cousin, aren't you?

1193
01:21:20,743 --> 01:21:21,414
Yes

1194
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:22,355
Come here

1195
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,225
Lakshmi, when she calls out to me,
I am getting electric shocks

1196
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,687
Give that electric shock to her too.

1197
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:28,554
Is it?
- Yes.

1198
01:21:30,519 --> 01:21:31,395
Tell me, dear.

1199
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:35,330
You look very nice to me.

1200
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:36,928
VWII you talk to your grandpa?

1201
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:38,937
Grandpa?

1202
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:40,835
I told you just now.
- Yes, you did

1203
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:43,870
Only he supported our love story.

1204
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:44,904
Call him.

1205
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:46,012
You be seated.

1206
01:21:46,102 --> 01:21:49,083
He is relaxed.
He can even take a selfie with you

1207
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,585
Keep pursuing it, huh?

1208
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:56,419
Yes

1209
01:21:56,879 --> 01:21:58,017
Hello?
- Give the phone to grandpa.

1210
01:21:58,214 --> 01:21:59,284
Okay, be on the line please, sir.

1211
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:00,026
Sir.

1212
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,722
Hello?
- Grandpa

1213
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,362
\Mll you talk to your granddaughter?
- Granddaughter?

1214
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,428
Grandpa

1215
01:22:11,627 --> 01:22:12,765
Hello grandpa.

1216
01:22:13,996 --> 01:22:15,373
I am Rukmini speaking

1217
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:19,045
How are you, dear?
- I am good, grandpa.

1218
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,481
But mom and dad are not agreeing

1219
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:24,809
It is not a small matter, dear.

1220
01:22:25,074 --> 01:22:26,109
Whether small or big..

1221
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,785
...it is a long gone matter now.

1222
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,718
Isn't it wrong to
still be angry about it?

1223
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,883
You are so young, but talk so maturely.

1224
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:35,628
Grandma, why do they oppose
ifl want to marry my uncle?

1225
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:38,627
Marriage?
- One minute

1226
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:40,467
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1227
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,226
Hey!
- Grandpa, I will talk to you later.

1228
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:48,274
Uncle and aunt's daughter
are playing games.

1229
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,440
Talking to grandpa.

1230
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:52,335
...l feel like crying

1231
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:55,573
If you feel like crying, why
don't you embrace him and cry. Go ahead

1232
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:56,305
Embrace him.

1233
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:59,480
Had I known that there's so much benefit,
I would've pushed my girlfriend too.

1234
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,119
Is the fried rice ready?

1235
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:03,915
There's so much spice in their story..

1236
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:05,287
...so offer them boiled rice

1237
01:23:05,514 --> 01:23:09,690
Sir, I know this is more
important to you than food now.

1238
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:10,759
What is it?

1239
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:13,590
Your love story may be old,
but this is a new sari.

1240
01:23:13,889 --> 01:23:18,099
Tell madam to wear this.
I can see my daughter in her.

1241
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:20,764
Oh..
- Sir, please tell her.

1242
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:21,664
Take it.

1243
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:23,472
Take it. - Take it.

1244
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,162
"..Your temperature goes high."

1245
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:52,396
"My teacher didn't teach
this to me in the school."

1246
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:55,572
"I need an answer."

1247
01:23:55,998 --> 01:23:59,002
"Why is the sari transparent?"

1248
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:04,908
"Though I don't want to see,
my eyes don't stop looking."

1249
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:11,214
"I don't know why
my heart is going crazy."

1250
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:30,177
"lfyou see a girl wearing sari,
your temperature goes high"

1251
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:36,575
"My teacher didn't teach
this to me in the school."

1252
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:11,748
"My two eyes..

1253
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:17,490
...used to laugh,
cry, and blink together."

1254
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:21,326
"Ever since they saw her beauty."

1255
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,424
"They forgot their friendship"

1256
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,926
"I wish to make a small mistake"

1257
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:30,594
...if she agrees to me."

1258
01:25:30,993 --> 01:25:36,671
'Wm punishment would she
give ifl bite her cheek once?"

1259
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,736
"Upset."

1260
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:42,842
"Why are you upset?"

1261
01:25:43,672 --> 01:25:49,247
"Though I avoid her,
she comes closer to me."

1262
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:55,321
"Though I want to kiss her,
she runs away."

1263
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,356
Darn it!

1264
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:36,892
"L was living my life happily."

1265
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:43,234
"I fell in love, lost my life,
and the road was filled with flowers."

1266
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:49,638
"When girlfriend came into my life,
my future became bright."

1267
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:55,580
"There shouldn't be any misunderstanding
in love as it is very painful to bear."

1268
01:26:56,245 --> 01:27:02,355
"There's already so
much pain in the body."

1269
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:08,000
"Wow, what happiness is this?"

1270
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:14,368
"No matter how much I try,
I am unable to sleep on time"

1271
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:20,442
"Though you wake up early in
the morning, it will be eleven o'clock"

1272
01:27:34,116 --> 01:27:39,896
"lfyou see a girl wearing sari,
your temperature goes high"

1273
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:45,455
"My teacher didn't teach
this to me in the school."

1274
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:46,796
"My teacher didn't teach
this to me in the school."

1275
01:27:48,964 --> 01:27:51,240
Everyone is so happy thinking
this wedding will take place

1276
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:52,377
Uncle.

1277
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:54,242
Do I have to wait until you return?

1278
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:56,777
Oh dear, do you want to marry?

1279
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:59,647
Sir, shejust asked if she
had to wait here - She didn't mean it.

1280
01:28:00,075 --> 01:28:02,646
From her eyes she asked
me if we'll marry. Right?

1281
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:04,781
Think their first night
will take place before they marry.

1282
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:05,822
Sir, come on

1283
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:08,752
Sir, you are getting ready for action.

1284
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:10,322
Lakshmi, what do you expect me to do?

1285
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:11,893
Sir, let's tell them the truth.

1286
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,623
Did I believe you when
you told me the truth?

1287
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:15,968
Sir, wait and watch.

1288
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,605
...l'll do something by which
they'll send the groom with me.

1289
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:21,672
Sir, greetings

1290
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,636
Greetings

1291
01:28:23,699 --> 01:28:24,734
Are you here to attend the wedding?

1292
01:28:24,933 --> 01:28:27,846
We came here to stop the
wedding and abduct the groom

1293
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:31,514
Didn't I tell you they won't believe us?

1294
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,343
Who are you?

1295
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,487
I am bride's younger brother

1296
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:39,014
He is elder brother: She is the bride

1297
01:28:39,281 --> 01:28:40,259
Where's the groom's room?

1298
01:28:40,649 --> 01:28:41,457
Sir, it is upstairs.

1299
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:42,953
Come, sir.

1300
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:45,998
So many people are working so hard for
the marriage that is going to be stopped"

1301
01:28:46,121 --> 01:28:47,623
...l am feeling so bad.

1302
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:53,532
Give me the flowers.
- Put this garland on the dais.

1303
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:58,007
Before the lights go off,
we have to escape from here.

1304
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:02,675
Hey, pass me those flowers

1305
01:29:03,238 --> 01:29:04,979
Sir, come on. I am here.

1306
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:10,383
Hey brother, why are you
sitting so sullen than Goddess Sta?

1307
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,625
He is seeing a photograph.
- I had to marry her..

1308
01:29:13,315 --> 01:29:14,350
"But I'm marrying her instead.

1309
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:15,960
That's the reason I am sad.

1310
01:29:16,485 --> 01:29:18,897
Hey, I understand your plight.

1311
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:19,890
How?

1312
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:24,733
That's a different matter.
You forget it. -I know, sir.

1313
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:25,869
Cool, sir. Cool.

1314
01:29:26,595 --> 01:29:27,630
Okay, let's go.

1315
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:30,069
Where? If they come to know,
we are dead.

1316
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,345
Who? They?

1317
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:34,578
Listen.

1318
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,580
"The times are over
when the warriors too lost.

1319
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:38,514
"But in this era,
only intelligent people win.

1320
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:40,587
They are brave,
but we are intelligent. Come on.

1321
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:44,923
Who is boss amongst you?

1322
01:29:45,414 --> 01:29:47,087
What bothers you who the boss is?

1323
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:50,257
Who has been talking
more since we've come here?

1324
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,442
Sir, please don't.

1325
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:13,519
Sir, you saved my life like god.
In the next birth I will".

1326
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:15,451
I was joking,
but you are taking it seriously.

1327
01:30:21,316 --> 01:30:22,056
Nab them!

1328
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,604
Hey, who are they?

1329
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:48,144
I should have been at home. Wham
am I doing here? What's going on here?

1330
01:32:52,968 --> 01:32:57,542
Can I know who is groom's father
who is getting him married by force?

1331
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,742
Okay.

1332
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:04,784
Who is the father of
the guy who is sleeping here?

1333
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,760
By hittingjust one man,
you show so much arrogance.

1334
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:13,731
Look, Mr. Veerappa

1335
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:18,026
A policeman develops arrogance
because of the uniform.

1336
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:22,806
...a politician develops
arrogance because..

1337
01:33:22,898 --> 01:33:25,640
...of his men who make
him win the elections.

1338
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:29,611
...girls develop arrogance because
guys fall for them but whereas l..

1339
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:34,447
...l develop arrogance after seeing how..

1340
01:33:34,576 --> 01:33:37,955
...my opponent behaves with me,
now you tell me..

1341
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,323
"What makes you so arrogant?

1342
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,589
Basiya!

1343
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:47,833
He is my brave elephant.

1344
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:10,512
No matter how huge the elephant I;
it is the mahouts who tames it.

1345
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:13,126
Veera! Basava! Kaala!

1346
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:18,425
I have hunted down a Lion having them.
- Good, Mr. Veerappa. Very good.

1347
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:23,363
But it is better if you
don't mess with certain Lions.

1348
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:25,263
Ask me why.
- Why?

1349
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:29,604
Because the hunters have become
preys themselves Mr. Veerappa.

1350
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:32,469
Thank you.

1351
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:36,505
This is my status Mr. Veerappa.

1352
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:40,983
Even if one of you touches that"

1353
01:34:41,076 --> 01:34:44,489
...it means I have lost and
if they put it on, it means I'm dead.

1354
01:36:51,606 --> 01:36:53,677
Come on!

1355
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:06,029
"He roars like a Lion."

1356
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:10,102
"He is like afireball."

1357
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:13,662
"Ranna"

1358
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:21,707
Hey, he is my daughter's fiancE.

1359
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:23,614
Wham you are doing is wrong.

1360
01:37:23,705 --> 01:37:25,275
Don't you think you're doing
wrong even without asking him..

1361
01:37:25,373 --> 01:37:27,512
...if he is willing to marry your daughter?

1362
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:31,222
Even if you get them married forcibly,
your daughter will die

1363
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:34,186
Tell me who is important.

1364
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:37,292
Let me tell you something, Doddamani.

1365
01:37:37,919 --> 01:37:42,629
Before you mess with someone
unnecessarily, remember this.

1366
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:45,695
...and if someone messes with you,
imply this

1367
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:48,904
Look, I'm like Bruce Lee

1368
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:53,536
There is only one difference between
him and me. He is not a Kannadiga.

1369
01:37:53,668 --> 01:37:58,014
...and l.. I'm real Kannadiga.

1370
01:37:58,673 --> 01:38:03,179
"Otherwise, my talks and my beatings..

1371
01:38:03,845 --> 01:38:06,348
...is same to same, sir.

1372
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:12,990
There is so much fun in giving
warning in North Kannada language.

1373
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:18,867
You discussed with the driver
before taking such a big decision..

1374
01:38:19,094 --> 01:38:21,836
...you didn't feel the need to inform
your parents? - Sir, l.. - Be quiet.

1375
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:25,172
How is it possible to
take such a big decision.

1376
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:26,609
"Without knowing who he is..

1377
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:29,112
...and whether or not
he will take good care of you?

1378
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:32,946
Am I right, Saraswati? - To feel
ashamed if someone falls in love.

1379
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:37,012
...or shoot if they got married,
we have human beings in our family".

1380
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,889
...no one is demon.

1381
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,963
We love you very much..

1382
01:38:47,722 --> 01:38:49,963
...and we also respect your love

1383
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:55,198
You have great respect
for your daughter's love..

1384
01:38:55,296 --> 01:38:58,209
...whereas for my daughter's marriage,
he has no respect.

1385
01:38:59,834 --> 01:39:02,246
If someone makes mistake.

1386
01:39:02,337 --> 01:39:06,786
"That person comes and apologizes to me
even before praying to God in the morning

1387
01:39:07,075 --> 01:39:10,784
He put me to shame before my people.

1388
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:14,783
I am feeling so ashamed.

1389
01:39:15,183 --> 01:39:18,630
My people will never
respect me hereafter:

1390
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:22,968
How can ever be quiet? Tell me.

1391
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:27,797
Sir, you are lawyer, isn't it?
Then do justice.

1392
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:39,308
The lady who offered you
buttermilk is my younger sister.

1393
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:42,149
We found a good marriage alliance
for her, it was a rich family.

1394
01:39:43,177 --> 01:39:46,954
We were also very happy about it..

1395
01:39:48,283 --> 01:39:55,599
...but we didn't bother to find out
if the guy wants to marry her or not.

1396
01:39:56,457 --> 01:40:00,371
If our grown up son doesn't earn money,
we can oust him from the house..

1397
01:40:00,862 --> 01:40:03,035
"But if our daughter gets married.

1398
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:06,168
...and stays back in her maternal house,
where will we send her?

1399
01:40:06,701 --> 01:40:10,706
Even a kid throws away
the thing that it doesn't like.

1400
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:17,715
So isn't it wrong to get your daughter
married to the guy who doesn't like her?

1401
01:40:19,814 --> 01:40:21,384
Look, Mr. Veerappa

1402
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:24,190
Tell me the expense
for your daughter's marriage.

1403
01:40:24,252 --> 01:40:27,859
...l will bear it thinking
her to be my daughter:

1404
01:40:29,858 --> 01:40:33,305
How dare you weigh
my dignity with money?

1405
01:40:33,561 --> 01:40:38,010
How much will you pay me?
- Hey! - Move back! Move back!

1406
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:44,373
This is for cutting harvest
and to behead someone.

1407
01:40:45,006 --> 01:40:48,317
Behead him if you want to..

1408
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:51,513
...he wanted to get his
son married without his consent.

1409
01:40:52,113 --> 01:40:54,218
They are good people.

1410
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:57,854
"That's why they
offered you buttermilk.

1411
01:40:58,286 --> 01:41:02,063
Had it been us, we would've
thrown them out of our house

1412
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:04,732
I'm sorry, sir.

1413
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,572
My father got upset since
his daughter's marriage got stalled.

1414
01:41:10,465 --> 01:41:13,537
Please try to understand.
- Why are you apologizing to him?

1415
01:41:13,768 --> 01:41:16,009
They are good people

1416
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:26,422
Look, it is wrong on
our pan to talk about money.

1417
01:41:27,882 --> 01:41:33,764
Although we cannot bring back
your dignity, the honor of our family..

1418
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:38,795
...we will get our second
daughter married to your son.

1419
01:41:40,662 --> 01:41:42,573
Do you accept this alliance?

1420
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:55,914
Seeing all this, I don't think
you are here to take your aunt back.

1421
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:57,956
...looks like you are here
to get her daughter's married.

1422
01:41:58,079 --> 01:41:59,319
Do something, boss.

1423
01:42:04,652 --> 01:42:06,393
Chandu

1424
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:13,162
I was wondering why
your boss sent you away"

1425
01:42:13,861 --> 01:42:16,501
"though you saved his wife's life..

1426
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,440
"But now I understand.

1427
01:42:18,933 --> 01:42:22,676
...why we can retain things that we like.

1428
01:42:23,337 --> 01:42:25,339
We offer milk to snake pit..

1429
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:29,819
"But if the same snake pit is
inside our house, we demolish it.

1430
01:42:30,545 --> 01:42:33,253
This marriage is taking
place because of you..

1431
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:38,353
"But I'm scared
if the wedding will get stalled.

1432
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:42,263
...if that person gets irritated
again seeing you here.

1433
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:47,203
Chandu, you are like medicine

1434
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,041
You save lives on time.

1435
01:42:50,331 --> 01:42:55,007
"But there is also an expiry date

1436
01:42:56,904 --> 01:42:59,145
I hope you understand.

1437
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:50,099
Grandpa's condition is critical.

1438
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:53,435
He's having respiration
problem since morning.

1439
01:43:54,695 --> 01:43:56,538
They have given oxygen.

1440
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:02,343
Bhargaw please come back
Forget about your aunt.

1441
01:44:03,805 --> 01:44:06,581
Come and see your grandpa for once.

1442
01:44:07,208 --> 01:44:09,518
I shouldn't see grandpa,
grandpa should see aunt.

1443
01:44:12,046 --> 01:44:15,391
I won't break the promise
of bring aunt for grandpa's birthday

1444
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:21,364
Tell him to please fulfill the
promise of waiting until I bring aunt.

1445
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:25,392
Do you hear me? Go tell him this

1446
01:44:26,461 --> 01:44:28,737
Tell him to fulfill the promise

1447
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:35,041
Please tell him to be alive.
Please, dad.

1448
01:44:42,076 --> 01:44:43,987
I want just one chance.

1449
01:44:45,246 --> 01:44:47,590
Just one chance

1450
01:44:52,854 --> 01:44:55,562
Hello.
- Veerappa here.

1451
01:44:55,656 --> 01:44:56,896
Tell me, brother:

1452
01:44:57,024 --> 01:45:01,166
My brother's son Bhaskar
will come to your house tomorrow.

1453
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,798
He will be doing the
wedding arrangements.

1454
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:07,078
We are very fond of him

1455
01:45:07,168 --> 01:45:12,083
Make sure he is provided
with everything - Bhaskar.

1456
01:45:12,507 --> 01:45:15,750
He went to Uganda with
just 2 lakes and did agriculture.

1457
01:45:15,977 --> 01:45:18,184
Farmers usually get crops.

1458
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:21,259
"This man found diamonds
along with crops

1459
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:24,126
From then on, his fate changed.

1460
01:45:24,452 --> 01:45:26,454
He made billions in just five years.

1461
01:45:26,554 --> 01:45:28,932
Really?
- Don't be shocked.

1462
01:45:29,023 --> 01:45:31,765
He also wants to win Oscar award

1463
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:33,164
Why will anyone give him Oscar award?

1464
01:45:33,294 --> 01:45:35,638
So he himself came up with
an award called Bhaskar award.

1465
01:45:35,729 --> 01:45:38,642
...made afilm and presented
himself with an award. - Which film?

1466
01:45:38,966 --> 01:45:40,343
300 inspirations.

1467
01:45:40,467 --> 01:45:43,505
He made afilm called 306,
he himself is the hero.

1468
01:45:43,571 --> 01:45:44,838
Use your next words carefully, Leonidas

1469
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:47,285
Use your next words carefully, Leonidas

1470
01:45:47,374 --> 01:45:50,685
They maybe your last as a king

1471
01:46:00,254 --> 01:46:04,464
Persians or Greeks
no man threatens a messenger.

1472
01:46:04,726 --> 01:46:07,900
You bring the crowns
and heads of the other kings..

1473
01:46:08,029 --> 01:46:11,408
...to my steps and you insult my queen.

1474
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:14,035
You threaten my people with death.

1475
01:46:14,168 --> 01:46:17,047
I am choosing my words very carefully.

1476
01:46:17,105 --> 01:46:19,210
"Perhaps, you should do the same.

1477
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:24,551
This is madness!
- This is Spartan!

1478
01:46:24,845 --> 01:46:27,826
No!

1479
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:33,387
The best pan I;
he also played the heroine in the film.

1480
01:46:48,769 --> 01:46:51,249
He spent lot of money
and took the award for free

1481
01:46:51,372 --> 01:46:54,376
I wish my parents witnessed
me winning the award

1482
01:46:54,475 --> 01:46:55,715
They would've died at once.

1483
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:59,622
The audience said every single
scene in the film was like a diamond.

1484
01:46:59,947 --> 01:47:03,258
If you spend one diamond for
every scene, it is bound to be good.

1485
01:47:03,384 --> 01:47:07,924
Actually, this award belongs to my
parents Mummy, daddy, this is for you.

1486
01:47:09,957 --> 01:47:13,370
Swami, you don't know
one more thing about him

1487
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:17,737
It was in this house he stole 2 lakes.

1488
01:47:18,966 --> 01:47:22,641
He used to work in your place

1489
01:47:26,407 --> 01:47:28,944
He brought me as easily
as winning a cup in a race.

1490
01:47:29,176 --> 01:47:32,316
The other name for safety is Chandu.
Excuse me.

1491
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:33,948
Thank you, Chandu.

1492
01:47:34,015 --> 01:47:37,792
You are really one man army.
- Stop praising him so much.

1493
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:39,630
He didn't win a battle

1494
01:47:39,753 --> 01:47:43,895
Why are you getting angry? - Go on, the
next time, your husband will get angry.

1495
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:46,498
You are such a spoilsport.

1496
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:51,140
Ms. Rukmani, decrease your
angry and increase your patience.

1497
01:47:51,265 --> 01:47:53,074
...because the family
that you are getting in..

1498
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:55,408
...number of swords are
more than human beings there.

1499
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:58,450
Whom should I marry then? Tell me

1500
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:02,253
Oh should I marry a man who will make
me sit on his laps and tell me stories?

1501
01:48:03,944 --> 01:48:06,322
Are you wondering how I know all this?

1502
01:48:06,547 --> 01:48:10,256
I thrashed nurse yesterday
and he revealed everything.

1503
01:48:11,018 --> 01:48:14,989
Do you know who is responsible
for my state? It's you.

1504
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,698
I fell for you on the
very first day I saw you

1505
01:48:24,298 --> 01:48:26,608
Magnet attracts only iron.

1506
01:48:27,168 --> 01:48:29,011
"But your eyes everything they see.

1507
01:48:31,038 --> 01:48:33,018
"But how can I marry a driver?

1508
01:48:33,474 --> 01:48:36,114
She is getting married to MBA graduate.

1509
01:48:37,545 --> 01:48:42,688
...her children will go to kindergarten
and my children will go to local garden?

1510
01:48:43,918 --> 01:48:47,388
Although you lost your job,
why do I still like you?

1511
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:51,401
When you come close,
my heart starts pounding..

1512
01:48:52,059 --> 01:48:54,300
...l legs start trembling.

1513
01:48:55,062 --> 01:48:59,533
Even now they are trembling, but
you can't see because they are covered.

1514
01:49:00,601 --> 01:49:02,512
I'd decided not to tell you..

1515
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:06,849
"But since you won't fall for me,
I told you.

1516
01:49:08,609 --> 01:49:11,522
I want to tell you one more thing.
I only said I want to tell..

1517
01:49:11,779 --> 01:49:13,884
...did I ask you to listen?
Close your ears.

1518
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:19,990
I love you.

1519
01:49:21,355 --> 01:49:23,892
It's up to you now. Do what you please

1520
01:49:33,367 --> 01:49:36,507
"Lord knows."

1521
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:42,714
"Lord knows."

1522
01:49:47,047 --> 01:49:55,228
"My heart sang seeing you, butterfly
- Butterfly"

1523
01:49:55,889 --> 01:50:01,965
"My heart sang seeing you, butterfly"

1524
01:50:03,397 --> 01:50:07,971
"Ranna, come Come and embrace me"

1525
01:50:08,102 --> 01:50:12,551
"Paint my heart with
different colors, Ranna"

1526
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,916
"I fell for your face, Ranna."

1527
01:50:15,009 --> 01:50:19,549
"I fell for your voice, Ranna
I fell for your style, Ranna."

1528
01:50:19,746 --> 01:50:22,090
"I will give you full marks"

1529
01:50:22,183 --> 01:50:26,427
"You are my begum and I am your sultan."

1530
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:30,491
"Butterfly"

1531
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:35,164
"Butterfly"

"You are my begum and I am your sultan."

1546
01:52:26,273 --> 01:52:30,449
"I fell for your quality."

1547
01:52:31,145 --> 01:52:34,752
"I surrendered my glamour to you."

1548
01:52:34,882 --> 01:52:37,089
"I climbed the satellite speaken.

1549
01:52:37,218 --> 01:52:39,459

Boss.

Good news.

1563
01:53:35,276 --> 01:53:36,687
I worked hard in this house

1564
01:53:37,478 --> 01:53:38,980
These are the people who made me cry.

1565
01:53:39,113 --> 01:53:40,649
Hello everybody. How are you?

1566
01:53:41,515 --> 01:53:43,324
Why are everyone
watching me so seriously?

1567
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:47,358
Have you zipped your pants?

1568
01:53:49,223 --> 01:53:49,997
Yes sir.

1569
01:53:50,491 --> 01:53:51,868
Have you zipped my pants?

1570
01:53:52,226 --> 01:53:53,330
Sir, you are not wearing a pant.

1571
01:53:54,294 --> 01:53:55,705
Wham made you come here? - He?

1572
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:59,301
He is my personal.
- He worked here for so long

1573
01:53:59,633 --> 01:54:00,611
He quit recently.

1574
01:54:00,734 --> 01:54:02,975
He has become a good
guy after quitting yourjob.

1575
01:54:03,337 --> 01:54:05,544
Had he left the city like I did,
he would've become rich man

1576
01:54:05,672 --> 01:54:06,343
Actually, sir.

1577
01:54:07,574 --> 01:54:08,143
What is this?

1578
01:54:08,375 --> 01:54:10,480
I've passed my exams in first class

1579
01:54:10,577 --> 01:54:12,056
Oh..
- Sweets got over..

1580
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:13,817
...so please at least take sugar.
- Sugar?

1581
01:54:15,049 --> 01:54:16,221
I already have it.

1582
01:54:17,217 --> 01:54:17,820
Take 2 lakes.

1583
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:19,823
If you pass next year..

1584
01:54:20,087 --> 01:54:22,465
...then organize a feast for
the entire city. Okay, sweetie?

1585
01:54:22,556 --> 01:54:23,500
Hey, sir..

1586
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,169
Yes
- 2 lakes.

1587
01:54:25,259 --> 01:54:27,705
2 lakes..
- Relax, man.

1588
01:54:27,995 --> 01:54:30,999
You stole 2 lakes,
so we threw you out of the house.

1589
01:54:31,098 --> 01:54:35,046
Hey, lam not a leather
ball to bounce back.

1590
01:54:35,402 --> 01:54:39,646
I am not a plastic ball
either which will not bounce back.

1591
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,251
I am ball.
- No.

1592
01:54:41,408 --> 01:54:42,216
Crazy ball.

1593
01:54:42,343 --> 01:54:45,756
As soon as you throw me, you won't know
where I will be and what I will be doing.

1594
01:54:50,751 --> 01:54:51,991
I like music.

1595
01:54:52,453 --> 01:54:53,557
I like ladies.

1596
01:54:54,021 --> 01:54:56,331
Different people like different things,
so why are you giving build up?

1597
01:54:59,426 --> 01:55:02,430
Your cheeks are so smooth

1598
01:55:02,897 --> 01:55:04,240
I use face wash.

1599
01:55:04,531 --> 01:55:06,533
Bhaskar sir is so naughty, right? -Yes.

1600
01:55:06,734 --> 01:55:07,769
Hey Bhaskar!

1601
01:55:08,468 --> 01:55:09,538
How are you?

1602
01:55:11,205 --> 01:55:13,549
Sir, she is coming to embrace you.

1603
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:16,584
Hey; it is better I hang
myself instead of hugging her.

1604
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:21,520
How are you?
- I am good.

1605
01:55:21,882 --> 01:55:24,260
Bhaskar, it's been
many days since I saw you.

1606
01:55:24,618 --> 01:55:26,427
I missed you so much

1607
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:30,124
Oh is it? - Yes.
- Whenever I got hiccups in Uganda.

1608
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:32,768
...l thought you were remembering me.

1609
01:55:33,093 --> 01:55:34,970
My serial named 'Friends'
is starting from today.

1610
01:55:35,229 --> 01:55:36,765
...please watch it
without missing a shot.

1611
01:55:40,634 --> 01:55:45,208
Is she the same little girl who
used to cry a lot when she was young?

1612
01:55:45,506 --> 01:55:46,712
She's grown up.

1613
01:55:49,309 --> 01:55:49,980
I am coming

1614
01:55:51,812 --> 01:55:53,314
I will just act to save her.

1615
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:54,456
But you do the rest.

1616
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:01,092
I'll pick it up

1617
01:56:04,424 --> 01:56:05,425
Hey Bhaskar, how are you?

1618
01:56:06,026 --> 01:56:06,834
Greetings, ma'am.

1619
01:56:16,103 --> 01:56:18,583
I have some work, I'll be back.
- Okay, ma'am.

1620
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,420
Sir, you got scared when you saw her.

1621
01:56:22,509 --> 01:56:24,580
Hey, some are very powerful.

1622
01:56:24,878 --> 01:56:26,789
We feel like respecting them

1623
01:56:27,281 --> 01:56:29,158
But there are some
who make no difference

1624
01:56:29,349 --> 01:56:30,327
Example, my wife

1625
01:56:39,025 --> 01:56:40,197
Bhaskan.
- Sir..

1626
01:56:40,961 --> 01:56:44,499
Mr. Veerapan was praising you a lot.
- Oh, really sir?

1627
01:56:44,698 --> 01:56:45,472
Yes

1628
01:56:45,565 --> 01:56:47,203
They say you should
organize the wedding.

1629
01:56:47,401 --> 01:56:48,607
VWII you?
- ls it?

1630
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:50,004
Sir.

1631
01:56:52,706 --> 01:56:54,310
Wham you can expect from me?

1632
01:56:59,713 --> 01:57:00,783
A little mannerism.

1633
01:57:03,083 --> 01:57:04,790
He says, mannerism

1634
01:57:05,019 --> 01:57:08,193
They treated me like garbage,
so I'll stop the wedding.

1635
01:57:08,488 --> 01:57:10,365
...and I will make them cry..

1636
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:11,498
What?

1637
01:57:12,192 --> 01:57:14,138
I will make them cry.
- But how?

1638
01:57:14,227 --> 01:57:16,707
Did you see the second
daughter of this house?

1639
01:57:17,030 --> 01:57:19,510
Hey, you like her?
- I want her.

1640
01:57:19,933 --> 01:57:21,708
Then you have to meet someone.

1641
01:57:23,203 --> 01:57:23,510
Who is it?

1642
01:57:40,587 --> 01:57:43,727
"Come, let's serve the sage."

1643
01:57:44,024 --> 01:57:47,028

<i>"I'll</i> do magic, hold my hand."

01:59:29,696 --> 01:59:30,766
Saga.
. Yes?

1668
01:59:30,864 --> 01:59:32,935
My right hand didn't
trust the left hand..

1669
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:36,044
"But after I met you,
they both are inseparable.

1670
01:59:36,236 --> 01:59:38,682
They are not leaving each other.
Sage, you are great.

1671
01:59:39,739 --> 01:59:41,377
Bijapur, forget about me.

1672
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:45,721
...in this era, you don't water to drink,
but you've got jewelry. - Yes, sage.

1673
01:59:45,846 --> 01:59:48,019
Wham else do you need?

1674
01:59:48,214 --> 01:59:49,022
What?

1675
01:59:49,149 --> 01:59:50,184
Just listen to him

1676
01:59:50,517 --> 01:59:52,519
Sage travels very often.

1677
01:59:53,654 --> 01:59:54,359
Sage.

1678
01:59:54,721 --> 01:59:57,725
...like a baby stops
crying when cuddled.

1679
01:59:58,057 --> 02:00:00,230
...same way, I have some doubts.

1680
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:01,498
What is that, Davengere?

1681
02:00:01,595 --> 02:00:03,074
I have come here for a wedding.

1682
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:05,073
The bride's name is Rukmini.

1683
02:00:06,266 --> 02:00:07,210
She shouldn't get married.

1684
02:00:07,567 --> 02:00:08,739
Chitradurga,
her marriage won't take place.

1685
02:00:08,869 --> 02:00:10,075
I want her.

1686
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:14,482
Duryodhan, she will belong
to only the one she loves.

1687
02:00:14,574 --> 02:00:16,019
He is talking about Mahabharam now.

1688
02:00:17,211 --> 02:00:19,691
No one loves her more than me.
- Not at all.

1689
02:00:19,879 --> 02:00:21,916
Next?
- My mines and diamonds..

1690
02:00:22,115 --> 02:00:23,560
"Currency, GITOQQHCE"

1691
02:00:23,683 --> 02:00:24,889
"future, glamoun.

1692
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:26,859
...all this has to stay with me

1693
02:00:26,953 --> 02:00:28,432
Whatever is yours.

1694
02:00:28,755 --> 02:00:32,066
...will stay with you until
the last breath, Shakuni.

1695
02:00:32,192 --> 02:00:35,002
If you want things to work as you wish..

1696
02:00:35,628 --> 02:00:37,904
...you have to stay where you are.

1697
02:00:38,031 --> 02:00:40,671
On this tree?
- Not tree, idiot!

1698
02:00:42,535 --> 02:00:43,445
It is tree of knowledge.

1699
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:44,878
If it is good for me..

1700
02:00:44,972 --> 02:00:48,852
"Then I'll take this tree
with me and water it daily.

1701
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:52,082
He is blessing you.

1702
02:00:52,745 --> 02:00:54,554
Why did sage turn into
Tarzan all of a sudden?

1703
02:00:54,715 --> 02:00:56,217
An elephant may come inside

1704
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:58,388
Good my son..
- Sage.

1705
02:00:58,652 --> 02:01:00,029
"This is the first time in my life..

1706
02:01:00,253 --> 02:01:02,733
...l am dying to see a man's face..

1707
02:01:02,956 --> 02:01:04,128
...and that is you.

1708
02:01:04,491 --> 02:01:05,526
Please turn.

1709
02:01:05,759 --> 02:01:07,568
Show me your face. I'll be blessed.

1710
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:11,403
Do you have guts to see my face?

1711
02:01:11,564 --> 02:01:12,406
Yes Sage.

1712
02:01:12,832 --> 02:01:15,142
Shall I turn?- Ye; sage

1713
02:01:15,502 --> 02:01:17,880
Shall I turn
- Ye; do it sage.

1714
02:01:40,494 --> 02:01:43,236
'If you lie, leaves will
fall and you'll vomit blood.'

1715
02:01:45,932 --> 02:01:46,910
Wait, I'll check.

1716
02:01:47,601 --> 02:01:50,241
I am like Challenging Star Darshan.

1717
02:01:51,605 --> 02:01:53,778
Sir, the leaves are falling.

1718
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:55,912
I can see that.

1719
02:01:56,109 --> 02:01:59,090
I am lover boy in Uganda

1720
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:02,659
It didn't fall.
- I'll break your teeth.

1721
02:02:03,049 --> 02:02:05,461
Even I can see I am a loafer!

1722
02:02:05,552 --> 02:02:09,261
He's a scoundrel,
dog, street dog, rabies dog, beggan.

1723
02:02:10,624 --> 02:02:11,534
It didn't fall.

1724
02:02:12,492 --> 02:02:14,836
Do I have so many qualities in me?

1725
02:02:15,195 --> 02:02:16,333
I only know so much.

1726
02:02:16,563 --> 02:02:17,633
I don't know what else...
- Who told you to come here?

1727
02:02:18,565 --> 02:02:20,044
Shall I go?
- You go from here.

1728
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:22,141
I don't like you.

1729
02:02:22,969 --> 02:02:23,709
I hate you.

1730
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:26,443
Hey, what is going on in this house?

1731
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:28,819
What's going on in this house?
- What's the matter?

1732
02:02:28,908 --> 02:02:30,478
Sir, what happened? - What happened?

1733
02:02:30,844 --> 02:02:34,223
Everyone is unaware of
what's happening in this house.

1734
02:02:34,347 --> 02:02:37,328
...l thought you were
following police system

1735
02:02:37,417 --> 02:02:38,555
But that's not the thing.

1736
02:02:38,685 --> 02:02:42,792
This is the scheme so that
the truth doesn't come out.

1737
02:02:43,022 --> 02:02:44,626
This people are not police.

1738
02:02:44,891 --> 02:02:46,199
They are fools
- What happened to him?

1739
02:02:46,426 --> 02:02:47,200
Hey, sir..

...is going around with a loafen.
- Shut up!

1744
02:02:55,502 --> 02:02:56,742
Should I stay mum?

1745
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,478
Why did you stop?
- Sorry.

1746
02:03:02,008 --> 02:03:03,009
Your daughter is fire

1747
02:03:03,209 --> 02:03:04,347
We are monkeys

1748
02:03:04,677 --> 02:03:07,157
Sorry for the inconvenience
You may leave now.

1749
02:03:07,347 --> 02:03:08,587
Go away.. move

1750
02:03:08,715 --> 02:03:10,661
They both were hugging each other,
was it fake?

1751
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:13,763
Hey, their hugging may be fake..

1752
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:17,727
"But I guarantee you
that I will trap her tonight.

1753
02:03:19,793 --> 02:03:20,931
Sir, what's the name of the drama?

1754
02:03:21,628 --> 02:03:23,733
'Ahalya amayiki'. Right?

1755
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:25,939
Then we have to find two girls

1756
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:29,706
Hey, Ahalya Amayiki
are not two different girls.

1757
02:03:30,036 --> 02:03:31,879
Ahalya is Amayiki (helpless).

1758
02:03:31,972 --> 02:03:34,851
Sir, there's so much
twist in the title What say?

1759
02:03:34,941 --> 02:03:39,048
Hey, if you see the screenplay,
there are so many twists in it.

1760
02:03:39,145 --> 02:03:40,590
Sir, tell us the concept.

1761
02:03:40,713 --> 02:03:41,521
Tell me the concept.

1762
02:03:42,082 --> 02:03:43,720
Gautam and Ahalya are a couple.

1763
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:46,521
Indra had an eye on Ahalya.

1764
02:03:46,753 --> 02:03:49,063
Sir, it is wrong, isn't it?
- Ahalya also said the same

1765
02:03:49,489 --> 02:03:51,867
So, Indra plans something.

1766
02:03:52,225 --> 02:03:53,926
Wham did he do?
- Watch on screen.

1767
02:03:53,927 --> 02:03:54,029
Wham did he do?
- Watch on screen.

1768
02:03:54,961 --> 02:03:59,637
Gautam wakes up one
hour before the sunrise.

1769
02:03:59,899 --> 02:04:02,072
...and thinks that
it is time to take bath.

1770
02:04:02,235 --> 02:04:03,407
...and goes to the river.

1771
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:07,382
Indra goes near Ahalya
disguised as Gautam

1772
02:04:07,674 --> 02:04:11,986
He watches Ahalya's beauty
with lust filled in his heart.

1773
02:04:12,145 --> 02:04:16,423
He wakes Ahalya from the
sleep by patting on her shoulder.

1774
02:04:18,284 --> 02:04:19,262
Dear..
- Yes?

1775
02:04:19,485 --> 02:04:21,123
Didn't you go to the river to have bath?

1776
02:04:21,254 --> 02:04:22,289
You are here..

1777
02:04:22,756 --> 02:04:25,430
...how can I go alone and have bath?

1778
02:04:25,525 --> 02:04:29,564
He tries to embrace Ahalya by force

1779
02:04:30,196 --> 02:04:31,140
You are so fragrant.

1780
02:04:32,532 --> 02:04:35,979
Hey, you went to the river to have bath,
why did you return?

1781
02:04:36,969 --> 02:04:38,812
I forgot the soap,
so I came to take that.

1782
02:04:38,972 --> 02:04:41,646
Take the soap and don't
return until the soap gets over.

1783
02:04:41,942 --> 02:04:42,943
MM'?
y?

1784
02:04:43,042 --> 02:04:46,489
Do you want to tease my beautiful wife?

1785
02:04:46,613 --> 02:04:47,785
Ye; I am Indra

1786
02:04:48,147 --> 02:04:49,990
I can do anything. It's my wish.

1787
02:04:50,117 --> 02:04:54,088
I am Gautam. I can do anything I wish

1788
02:04:54,187 --> 02:04:56,997
Hey, what will you do?
Hey, he's hitting me! Oh..

1789
02:05:03,229 --> 02:05:05,505
Oh god.

1790
02:05:10,036 --> 02:05:12,380
He alone hit me,
but looked like 10 people hit me.

1791
02:05:12,805 --> 02:05:15,445
His fingers are like hands.

1792
02:05:15,808 --> 02:05:18,812
If I have to be safe, I have
to change the scene. Scene reverse!

1793
02:05:29,155 --> 02:05:32,796
If they want to hit wherever they wish,
why should I read out the script?

1794
02:05:32,992 --> 02:05:35,529
Dear, didn't you go to have bath?

1795
02:05:35,662 --> 02:05:38,404
I have got mesmerized by you,
why should I take bath?

1796
02:05:38,765 --> 02:05:40,335
I will stay here with you.

1797
02:05:41,834 --> 02:05:42,471
Then...
- Hello?

1798
02:05:44,738 --> 02:05:45,682
Wham is going on here?

1799
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:47,814
Didn't you go to the river to take bath?

1800
02:05:48,007 --> 02:05:48,849
Bath?

1801
02:05:49,376 --> 02:05:52,585
There's drought everywhere
and there's no water to drink..

1802
02:05:52,846 --> 02:05:54,189
...how can I have bath?

1803
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:55,882
They have changed.
- Tell me something"

1804
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:58,195
...if there was no water in the river".

1805
02:05:58,284 --> 02:06:00,195
...you should've come back
and slept next to your wife.

1806
02:06:00,386 --> 02:06:02,662
...does anyone leave
their beautiful wives alone?

1807
02:06:02,889 --> 02:06:04,835
Hey, get up. Sir..

1808
02:06:04,957 --> 02:06:06,265
...she is not only beautiful".

1809
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:08,065
...that's the reason I married her.

1810
02:06:08,261 --> 02:06:08,898
Correction?
- Oh..

1811
02:06:09,529 --> 02:06:10,530
You are correcting me?

1812
02:06:10,963 --> 02:06:12,738
Hello, I am Gautam.

1813
02:06:12,966 --> 02:06:15,947
...l can make any corrections my wish.

1814
02:06:16,202 --> 02:06:19,513
I am Indra,
I can make any corrections as I wish."

1815
02:06:32,152 --> 02:06:34,428
No matter who get thrashed next..

1816
02:06:34,788 --> 02:06:35,858
...l will become Ahalya

1817
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:45,465
Wham a beautiful back.

1818
02:06:46,332 --> 02:06:47,242
0h god!

1819
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:48,743
Even he hit him on the back

1820
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:51,609
Dear, didn't you go to have bath?

1821
02:06:51,738 --> 02:06:54,241
I can't leave you alone
between these filthy people.

1822
02:06:54,641 --> 02:06:56,746
...so, I didn't feel
like going to have bath

1823
02:06:56,843 --> 02:06:58,618
You are so great.
- Idiot. - Dean.

1824
02:06:58,945 --> 02:06:59,923
Darling
- Dean.

1825
02:07:00,012 --> 02:07:01,082
Darling.
- Lustful..

1826
02:07:01,181 --> 02:07:01,818
Darling.

1827
02:07:02,682 --> 02:07:03,217
Who is it?

1828
02:07:03,983 --> 02:07:05,553
Please excuse me.
- Sure, boss. - Oh no.

1829
02:07:07,153 --> 02:07:09,497
Dear, didn't you go to take bath?

1830
02:07:09,822 --> 02:07:10,732
I went. .

1831
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:15,266
...l returned as I had a doubt on you.

1832
02:07:15,595 --> 02:07:17,268
So, you are going to hit him now.

1833
02:07:17,363 --> 02:07:19,502
Go on, hit him.. hit him.
- Hey. - I will hit him later..

1834
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:20,906
"First I'll teach you a lesson.

1835
02:07:21,467 --> 02:07:26,473
Hey, you are living with
me for 25 years, right? - Yes

1836
02:07:26,973 --> 02:07:27,974
Who is your husband..

1837
02:07:28,207 --> 02:07:31,450
...and who is a stranger,
couldn't you recognize?

1838
02:07:31,544 --> 02:07:32,852
It was dark.

1839
02:07:33,046 --> 02:07:34,753
Dark?
- I couldn't see him.

1840
02:07:34,848 --> 02:07:35,588
You couldn't see?

1841
02:07:36,683 --> 02:07:37,661
I came here to show you

1842
02:07:37,784 --> 02:07:38,922
Don't hit me. please don't..
- Come on..

1843
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:47,801
Oh god! Oh god!

1844
02:07:51,631 --> 02:07:52,837
I will be in the audience now.

1845
02:07:53,333 --> 02:07:54,937
You all go to hell.

1846
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:11,624
I'll see how he hits me now.

1847
02:08:12,051 --> 02:08:12,859
Even I'll see.

1848
02:08:14,153 --> 02:08:15,530
She didn't recognize you.

1849
02:08:16,556 --> 02:08:18,968
"But don't you have sense
that she is someone else's wife? - Oh!

1850
02:08:19,025 --> 02:08:20,368
\Mll you hit her now?

1851
02:08:21,193 --> 02:08:23,230
Why should I hit her? You scoundrel..

1852
02:08:23,496 --> 02:08:25,066
...l will thrash you.
- Oh no!

1853
02:08:25,898 --> 02:08:27,036
Oh, come here..

1854
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:29,544
Actually, it is futile to hit you.

1855
02:08:30,169 --> 02:08:31,546
Bhaskan.
- Wham is it?

1856
02:08:31,738 --> 02:08:33,046
Do you know what's going on here?

1857
02:08:33,172 --> 02:08:34,480
I know.

1858
02:08:34,607 --> 02:08:36,245
I wrote the script.

1859
02:08:36,443 --> 02:08:38,821
Is this man that girl's husband?

1860
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,481
N o.

1861
02:08:39,579 --> 02:08:42,423
No, right, then what you should've
done is. instead of telling her..

1862
02:08:42,882 --> 02:08:47,024
...'Dear Ahalya, the man here
is not your husband, but Indra.

1863
02:08:47,253 --> 02:08:51,224
...you are sitting there
and watching it shamelessly.

1864
02:08:51,357 --> 02:08:52,165
Wham do you mean?

1865
02:08:52,458 --> 02:08:54,870
Do you plan to hit me again
by considering this point?

1866
02:08:57,930 --> 02:09:01,434
Bhaskar, no matter what point,
but you'll surely be thrashed.

1867
02:09:01,601 --> 02:09:04,241
All the rapes in the country
are happening because of you.

1868
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:06,247
Hey, what are you watching? Thrash him!

1869
02:09:09,075 --> 02:09:09,241
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1870
02:09:09,242 --> 02:09:11,950
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1871
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:15,548
"Listen sister,
the hen has swallowed the monkey."

1872
02:09:16,649 --> 02:09:19,892
"Listen sister,
the hen has swallowed the monkey."

1873
02:09:19,986 --> 02:09:22,626
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1874
02:09:23,222 --> 02:09:26,135
"The goat swallowed the elephant.
The wall swallowed the paint."

1875
02:09:26,492 --> 02:09:29,268
"The goat swallowed the elephant.
The wall swallowed the paint."

1876
02:09:29,395 --> 02:09:32,399
"The drum swallowed
the actor playing it."

1877
02:09:32,932 --> 02:09:35,435
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1878
02:09:36,302 --> 02:09:39,306
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1879
02:09:39,505 --> 02:09:42,315
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1880
02:09:42,609 --> 02:09:45,920
"The grinder swallowed the grinding
pole. The plane swallowed the food."

1881
02:09:45,979 --> 02:09:49,119
"The grinder swallowed the grinding
pole. The plane swallowed the food."

1882
02:09:49,248 --> 02:09:52,058
"The wheat swallowed
the old woman who sowed it."

1883
02:09:52,151 --> 02:09:54,961
"Listen sister,
the hen has swallowed the monkey."

1884
02:09:55,988 --> 02:09:59,629
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1885
02:09:59,759 --> 02:10:03,138
"Listen sister,
the hen has swallowed the monkey."

1886
02:10:04,030 --> 02:10:06,943
"Listen sister,
the hen has swallowed the monkey."

1887
02:10:07,033 --> 02:10:09,801
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1888
02:10:09,802 --> 02:10:10,678
"The hen has swallowed the monkey."

1889
02:10:12,338 --> 02:10:14,818
Madam! Madam please save me.

1890
02:10:15,141 --> 02:10:16,347
Save me, madam. Save me

1891
02:10:16,709 --> 02:10:18,017
They all are hitting me

1892
02:10:18,945 --> 02:10:22,449
Sir, I'm the only batsman and
11 people are bowling How can l..

1893
02:10:22,548 --> 02:10:23,356
...hit the shot?

1894
02:10:24,684 --> 02:10:25,628
I want to talk to you.

1895
02:10:38,631 --> 02:10:39,701
Wham are you doing?

1896
02:10:40,667 --> 02:10:44,012
What will we do if Bhaskar
feels bad and cancels the wedding?

1897
02:10:45,571 --> 02:10:47,107
You want Saraswami.

1898
02:10:48,507 --> 02:10:50,544
But Saraswami Prakash lives here.

1899
02:10:52,712 --> 02:10:55,124
Prakash will never
go away from Saraswati.

1900
02:10:56,149 --> 02:10:58,151
This Saraswati will
never come close to you.

1901
02:11:00,019 --> 02:11:01,999
Your grandpa made us cry..

1902
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:07,000
...l was confident that
I will live happily here.

1903
02:11:09,228 --> 02:11:13,506
Please, don't come here and make me cry.

1904
02:11:16,236 --> 02:11:17,078
Go away.

1905
02:11:46,432 --> 02:11:47,877
Why aren't you ready yet?

1906
02:11:48,401 --> 02:11:50,244
He groom is coming in half an hour.

1907
02:11:50,403 --> 02:11:51,711
Do you agree to this wedding?

1908
02:11:52,071 --> 02:11:54,017
Don't give me a shock
in front of the groom.

1909
02:11:55,775 --> 02:11:57,413
Mom, the alarm didn't ring

1910
02:11:58,144 --> 02:11:59,782
Why are you questioning me so much?

1911
02:11:59,912 --> 02:12:01,721
Okay, go and get ready soon.

1912
02:12:03,883 --> 02:12:04,623
Tell me, dear.

1913
02:12:05,251 --> 02:12:08,926
Doctor is not in the town so I have
to take care of all the operations

1914
02:12:09,822 --> 02:12:11,893
The patient is here,
I'll call you later. Okay?

1915
02:12:14,393 --> 02:12:16,202
The tank is full. Take this

1916
02:12:18,965 --> 02:12:21,070
Mom, sister Rukku is not to be seen.

1917
02:12:22,001 --> 02:12:23,605
Her jewelry and clothes are missing.

1918
02:12:23,836 --> 02:12:25,816
Then I'm sure that
she eloped with Chandu

1919
02:12:29,676 --> 02:12:30,586
How do you know?

1920
02:12:30,843 --> 02:12:33,449
She proposed Chandu in front of me.
-Why didn't you tell this to us before?

1921
02:12:33,979 --> 02:12:36,960
I thought, generally like
every girl cheats their boyfriend.

1922
02:12:37,083 --> 02:12:40,826
...and would stay happily with
the guy her parents select for her.

1923
02:12:42,521 --> 02:12:45,001
You said you would
throw him out of the house

1924
02:12:45,691 --> 02:12:47,295
Who brought him inside again?

1925
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:51,333
Uncle, as per I know, there
are many things happening in this house.

1926
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:54,975
All that are blank,
so I am not able to link them.

1927
02:12:55,334 --> 02:12:58,315
It will be better if any
one of you fill up the blanks

1928
02:12:58,871 --> 02:13:01,010
Tell me the truth about what happened.

1929
02:13:01,541 --> 02:13:04,488
If you lie to me,
I will hang you to this tree.

1930
02:13:05,378 --> 02:13:07,085
You need not strain yourself.

1931
02:13:07,379 --> 02:13:09,120
That tree cannot withstand if I lie.

1932
02:13:09,315 --> 02:13:10,851
The leaves fall.

1933
02:13:11,183 --> 02:13:12,992
How is it connected to you?

1934
02:13:13,186 --> 02:13:14,790
If leaves fall, the tree will die..

1935
02:13:15,054 --> 02:13:16,499
...and if it dies I'll die.

1936
02:13:16,722 --> 02:13:18,099
We both are like a couple

1937
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:19,328
I've not married it yet, that's it.

1938
02:13:20,359 --> 02:13:23,499
Uncle, I'll tell you whatever I know.
Please put the gun down

1939
02:13:26,032 --> 02:13:28,012
Chandu, why are you sullen?

1940
02:13:28,868 --> 02:13:30,313
Your mother told me to leave.

1941
02:13:31,070 --> 02:13:32,640
Okay, let's elope

1942
02:13:33,573 --> 02:13:34,210
Where?

1943
02:13:35,842 --> 02:13:36,513
Mumbai?

1944
02:13:39,411 --> 02:13:39,889
How?

1945
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:41,988
In atrain.

1946
02:13:42,515 --> 02:13:45,655
If we go by flight, they'll
know it from the hotel travel desk

1947
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:55,396
Hey, the trees are falling off.

1948
02:13:55,761 --> 02:13:56,671
I didn't lie.

1949
02:13:57,363 --> 02:13:59,741
The leaves were falling
not because you were lying..

1950
02:14:00,099 --> 02:14:02,545
"But because Chandu
used to press this remote

1951
02:14:05,772 --> 02:14:06,546
Move aside!

1952
02:14:16,049 --> 02:14:17,528
Why are you getting worried?

1953
02:14:17,783 --> 02:14:19,660
It is not only hot in Mumbai..

1954
02:14:20,086 --> 02:14:22,589
"But buildings are more
for me to interior design it.

1955
02:14:23,355 --> 02:14:25,733
I am sure that I will surely get a job.

1956
02:14:25,958 --> 02:14:27,596
You earn as much
as you want as a driver.

1957
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,098
We can live happily.

1958
02:14:32,297 --> 02:14:33,571
If you don't get a job..

1959
02:14:34,633 --> 02:14:35,771
...give an ad, 'Joyalukas..

1960
02:14:36,736 --> 02:14:38,773
...my heart says'

1961
02:14:40,807 --> 02:14:43,378
If we have a child
in between these expenses.

1962
02:14:43,709 --> 02:14:45,916
...we'll send his photo to mom and dad..

1963
02:14:46,145 --> 02:14:49,217
"Then we'll be in their family photo.

1964
02:14:50,149 --> 02:14:51,423
Mum do you say?

1965
02:16:13,799 --> 02:16:15,608
Oh god! Oh!

1966
02:16:37,523 --> 02:16:38,558
Sir, give me the ticket.

1967
02:16:38,757 --> 02:16:39,701
“My should I give you a ticket?

1968
02:16:47,032 --> 02:16:48,238
You take the ticket.

1969
02:16:49,902 --> 02:16:51,745
Sir, stay quiet for two minutes.

1970
02:16:52,204 --> 02:16:54,150
If he watches me,
he'll give me a ticket to hell.

1971
02:17:18,264 --> 02:17:19,368
Do you know to read English?

1972
02:17:19,632 --> 02:17:22,875
Seeing him thrash everyone,
I learnt all the languages You shut up.

1973
02:17:34,246 --> 02:17:37,716
Hail Lord Shiva!

1974
02:17:38,484 --> 02:17:40,930
Hail Lord Shiva!

1975
02:17:48,427 --> 02:17:51,772
Hail Lord Shiva!

1976
02:18:13,252 --> 02:18:14,128
Sir, the flight is ready.

1977
02:18:14,754 --> 02:18:16,665
We'll not go by flight,
get us aticket, we'll go in train

1978
02:18:16,789 --> 02:18:18,791
Madam, you need not buy a ticket.
He owns a flight.

1979
02:18:20,293 --> 02:18:21,966
Sir, whatever you said is ready.
- Chandu!

1980
02:18:22,928 --> 02:18:23,303
N o.

1981
02:18:23,362 --> 02:18:24,602
Okay, sir.
- Chandu is a driver, right?

1982
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:26,969
Even after seeing us you
are questioning. What do I tell you?

1983
02:18:35,141 --> 02:18:36,119
Boss, they all are here

1984
02:18:37,843 --> 02:18:38,685
N arayan.
- Sir.

1985
02:18:39,111 --> 02:18:40,522
I want to buy this
station in 15 minutes

1986
02:18:41,513 --> 02:18:42,958
Sir, it is difficult
if you say suddenly.

1987
02:18:43,682 --> 02:18:45,958
Narayan, can't you
vacate this small station?

1988
02:18:46,118 --> 02:18:47,620
Passengers?
- Make some alternative arrangements.

1989
02:18:48,354 --> 02:18:50,027
Send everyone in flights
to their destinations

1990
02:18:50,289 --> 02:18:52,269
In some places if there's no airport,
then arrange for vehicles

1991
02:18:52,391 --> 02:18:53,267
Call the railway ministry.

1992
02:18:53,559 --> 02:18:55,266
Convince the station master,
if he doesn't listen, then threaten him.

1993
02:18:56,028 --> 02:18:58,440
Anyone will not say no
to money to fulfill their needs.

1994
02:18:59,064 --> 02:19:02,307
Narayan, this meeting is very important.

1995
02:19:02,401 --> 02:19:04,642
I want this station at any cost.
Do you get it?

1996
02:19:31,363 --> 02:19:32,671
Do you want my daughter?

1997
02:19:34,833 --> 02:19:36,676
You work for me for money..

1998
02:19:37,169 --> 02:19:40,173
...how did you think that
I'll marry my daughter to you?

1999
02:19:41,206 --> 02:19:44,085
Hey, aren't you ashamed
to elope with a driver?

2000
02:19:45,043 --> 02:19:45,987
Leave her. Leave her.

2001
02:19:46,112 --> 02:19:48,092
Sir, first see who's holding whom.

2002
02:19:48,347 --> 02:19:50,520
You back answer me? I will kill you!

2003
02:19:57,055 --> 02:20:01,197
You are questioning me that how can
an ordinary driver marry your daughter.

2004
02:20:02,628 --> 02:20:03,868
...one millionaire..

2005
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:07,374
"Doesn't he have the rights to
ask you how did you marry..

2006
02:20:07,466 --> 02:20:09,912
...his daughter when you
were a common lawyer?

2007
02:20:10,903 --> 02:20:14,373
You got married and directly went
to his house and said you were married.

2008
02:20:15,073 --> 02:20:16,347
...how did that man tolerate?

2009
02:20:17,909 --> 02:20:18,717
But your daughter..

2010
02:20:19,812 --> 02:20:24,693
...when you heard that she was marrying
a driver, you couldn't even hear that.

2011
02:20:26,051 --> 02:20:27,621
Just because you love her..

2012
02:20:27,753 --> 02:20:31,963
...you are pointing a gun
at me thinking I am a driven.

2013
02:20:34,259 --> 02:20:35,260
"But his daughter;

2014
02:20:36,562 --> 02:20:42,035
...she got married and came home, and
he got angry, isn't that foolishness?

2015
02:20:43,769 --> 02:20:44,611
Yours is love.

2016
02:20:45,971 --> 02:20:46,779
"But his is anger.

2017
02:20:49,742 --> 02:20:51,813
You are doing out of love,
but he did it out of revenge

2018
02:20:53,678 --> 02:20:55,419
If you scold, it is love..

2019
02:20:57,316 --> 02:21:00,092
"But if he shout; it's arrogance.

2020
02:21:02,187 --> 02:21:03,097
Who are you?

2021
02:21:03,188 --> 02:21:06,101
You took her out of
the house with rights.

2022
02:21:07,492 --> 02:21:08,402
...her cousin.

2023
02:21:09,628 --> 02:21:14,907
I am the son of the man who is regretting
daily for letting his sister go away.

2024
02:21:16,302 --> 02:21:17,838
And the grandson of an old man..

2025
02:21:18,337 --> 02:21:22,581
...who is waiting for
his daughter to return home.

2026
02:21:24,442 --> 02:21:27,685
He is a millionaire.
He has provided job to many.

2027
02:21:28,447 --> 02:21:31,257
I am a poor man who has
factories across the country.

2028
02:21:32,183 --> 02:21:33,457
Chandra Swarastara

2029
02:21:35,054 --> 02:21:36,192
Tell me, what has changed?

2030
02:21:37,122 --> 02:21:38,863
Today he is holding a gun
and that day he did the same.

2031
02:21:39,057 --> 02:21:41,503
If you think what he did was mistake,
then what is this?

2032
02:21:42,694 --> 02:21:44,037
Leave your daughter;
I will take her with me.

2033
02:21:44,996 --> 02:21:48,034
Aunt, if you think you are right,
then even he was right.

2034
02:21:50,569 --> 02:21:51,673
Aunt, stop being angry.

2035
02:21:53,005 --> 02:21:54,211
Come with me, I will take you along

2036
02:21:56,074 --> 02:21:58,645
Aunt, I'm telling this to convince you.

2037
02:21:59,745 --> 02:22:00,985
"Both are at fault.

2038
02:22:02,514 --> 02:22:04,687
Aunt, he realized
his mistake the same day.

2039
02:22:05,917 --> 02:22:07,828
Why don't you realize your mistake?

2040
02:22:10,355 --> 02:22:13,495
Everyone heard you cry when
I left the house that day, aunt.

2041
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:15,731
Everyone heard you cry.

2042
02:22:17,095 --> 02:22:20,235
Had you heard our cry
for once standing at the door..

2043
02:22:22,701 --> 02:22:25,147
...all this wouldn't have
lasted for 25 year; aunt.

2044
02:22:26,104 --> 02:22:28,675
'Saru.
- Don't worry, brother.'

2045
02:22:29,608 --> 02:22:31,053
'I won't file case
against your husband.'

2046
02:22:33,946 --> 02:22:35,516
'Father, at least you..'

2047
02:22:37,850 --> 02:22:39,158
'N ever mind, son.'

2048
02:22:41,119 --> 02:22:43,099
'I tried to kill my daughter.'

2049
02:22:45,257 --> 02:22:47,737
'How could l.. how could l..

2050
02:22:49,928 --> 02:22:52,602
...try to kill my own daughter?'

2051
02:22:54,766 --> 02:22:56,439
'I shouldn't be alive.'

2052
02:22:56,568 --> 02:22:58,514
'Father, please calm down.
- I shouldn't be alive.'

2053
02:22:58,603 --> 02:23:01,277
'We have had enough. Please calm down.'

2054
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:02,514
'Father?

2055
02:23:46,151 --> 02:23:49,291
In life, there are two ways
to solve any kind of problem, aunt.

2056
02:23:52,157 --> 02:23:53,966
\Mth love or with hatred.

2057
02:23:56,795 --> 02:23:59,002
I chose the first option.

2058
02:24:01,466 --> 02:24:02,968
...you chose the second.

2059
02:24:06,371 --> 02:24:08,749
Think in our point
of view for once, aunt.

2060
02:24:11,376 --> 02:24:15,017
You left grandpa since
he shot uncle's shoulden.

2061
02:24:17,716 --> 02:24:19,821
"But he killed my mother,
what do I do to him?

2062
02:24:22,987 --> 02:24:27,834
It was only because of you
he pulled the gun out that day".

2063
02:24:29,227 --> 02:24:32,208
"But like you, did I hate grandpa?
I didn't.

2064
02:24:33,231 --> 02:24:36,701
I was raised by him, aunt.

2065
02:24:38,069 --> 02:24:38,979
Even today.

2066
02:24:39,471 --> 02:24:42,315
...only for him, I came to your house..

2067
02:24:42,908 --> 02:24:45,946
...worked as a car driver
and sometime a gatekeeper, why aunt?

2068
02:24:48,146 --> 02:24:52,356
So that you come.
to that house at least now.

2069
02:24:53,218 --> 02:24:54,788
Why don't you understand?

2070
02:24:58,323 --> 02:24:59,190
When I was child..

2071
02:24:59,191 --> 02:24:59,328
When I was child..

2072
02:25:00,692 --> 02:25:03,172
...it was you who took
more care of me than mother.

2073
02:25:04,763 --> 02:25:07,175
You might've forgotten but I didn't.

2074
02:25:10,502 --> 02:25:12,880
You got upset and left the house..

2075
02:25:13,404 --> 02:25:15,850
...saying you didn't want anybody.

2076
02:25:17,609 --> 02:25:20,055
"But it wasn't you who lost something"

2077
02:25:21,179 --> 02:25:22,214
...it was I.

2078
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:30,224
When called for mother, father comes.

2079
02:25:31,356 --> 02:25:33,097
...when called for aunt, grandpa comes..

2080
02:25:34,526 --> 02:25:36,665
...but in that young age,
not knowing where mother went.

2081
02:25:37,195 --> 02:25:38,868
...and why isn't aunt coming"

2082
02:25:40,432 --> 02:25:43,379
...l was getting very angry, aunt.

2083
02:25:46,871 --> 02:25:52,253
I spent my childhood with
so many questions in my mind.

2084
02:25:54,646 --> 02:25:56,023
Even today.

2085
02:25:58,650 --> 02:26:05,090
...we keep a share for you in
the money we earn, the food we cook.

2086
02:26:05,456 --> 02:26:06,764
...we keep a share in everything for you.

2087
02:26:09,427 --> 02:26:10,531
Come back, aunt.

2088
02:26:11,596 --> 02:26:15,942
Come back and we will
take good care of you, aunt.

2089
02:26:18,303 --> 02:26:20,544
I like you very much, aunt.

2090
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:22,875
I like you very much, aunt.

2091
02:26:25,977 --> 02:26:27,581
For the mistake committed then..

2092
02:26:28,613 --> 02:26:31,753
...we have been apologizing
for the last 25 years

2093
02:26:32,984 --> 02:26:34,463
We have been apologizing

2094
02:26:35,153 --> 02:26:36,928
Why don't you understand?

2095
02:26:43,995 --> 02:26:45,497
Forgive us if you can..

2096
02:26:47,632 --> 02:26:48,610
"Otherwise, punish us.

2097
02:26:51,302 --> 02:26:53,646
At least let us know you remember us.

2098
02:26:56,608 --> 02:26:58,519
Please, let us know.

2099
02:27:01,279 --> 02:27:02,155
Let us know.

2100
02:27:45,857 --> 02:27:46,631
Bhargav

2101
02:27:48,760 --> 02:27:49,465
Call..

2102
02:27:51,663 --> 02:27:53,665
...l want to talk to father.

2103
02:28:00,838 --> 02:28:02,875
A real man is not the one who stands
everywhere with his head held high..

2104
02:28:04,543 --> 02:28:06,545
...a real man is the one
who knows where to bow his head

2105
02:28:44,415 --> 02:28:45,223
Prakash..

2106
02:28:47,719 --> 02:28:48,561
...my brother's son.

2107
02:28:52,223 --> 02:28:53,395
Nephew.

2108
02:29:01,299 --> 02:29:03,301
Hereafter,
he will never miss his mother

2109
02:29:13,278 --> 02:29:14,621
He is great man.

2110
02:29:15,346 --> 02:29:16,882
Not great man, he is a generous man.

2111
02:29:17,616 --> 02:29:21,223
Hey, stop praising him now.

2112
02:29:21,753 --> 02:29:23,824
He used me for my mother.

2113
02:29:24,255 --> 02:29:25,632
He used you for your mothen.

2114
02:29:25,757 --> 02:29:28,260
...he didn't exploit your
mother using you, calm down.

2115
02:29:28,793 --> 02:29:31,433
Hey! You idiots

2116
02:29:37,269 --> 02:29:37,940
By the WW-

2117
02:29:38,603 --> 02:29:39,809
...why did you kidnap me?

2118
02:29:39,937 --> 02:29:41,814
It was I who got you kidnapped.

2119
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:43,613
Bhaskar?
- Are you shocked?

2120
02:29:43,841 --> 02:29:47,914
You're bound to be shocked. The
story is yours but the climax is mine.

2121
02:29:50,281 --> 02:29:54,286
Not just you, even if hundreds men like
you threaten him, he won't get scared.

2122
02:29:54,886 --> 02:29:59,960
Get one thing clear. You can mess
with a bomb but if you mess with him..

2123
02:30:00,525 --> 02:30:02,198
...you can never get away, Bhaskar.

2124
02:30:02,327 --> 02:30:03,169
I won't believe

2125
02:30:03,295 --> 02:30:07,004
At time; you have to
believe seeing the cut out.

2126
02:30:07,298 --> 02:30:09,005
Hey, don't mess with me.

2127
02:30:09,301 --> 02:30:10,541
There's no need to talk to him.

2128
02:30:10,869 --> 02:30:11,813
Throw him out.

2129
02:30:12,170 --> 02:30:13,444
American Express Exchequer

2130
02:30:13,805 --> 02:30:16,479
It will come to you faster
than Shatabdi Express. - Take it.

2131
02:30:18,076 --> 02:30:19,851
Never mind even ifl lose my mines..

2132
02:30:20,211 --> 02:30:21,690
"But I won't spare him

2133
02:30:21,879 --> 02:30:23,620
'This is international news.'

2134
02:30:23,915 --> 02:30:26,225
The government of Uganda.

2135
02:30:26,351 --> 02:30:30,458
...has ordered to takeover
all the privates mines - Really?

2136
02:30:35,193 --> 02:30:36,228
It's film song.

2137
02:30:37,062 --> 02:30:39,167
...l thought it was some devotional song.

2138
02:30:39,497 --> 02:30:40,532
You idiot.

2139
02:30:40,865 --> 02:30:43,141
I thought this song was inspired
by some devotional song, sir.

2140
02:30:43,334 --> 02:30:45,371
You took me to that imposter..

2141
02:30:45,503 --> 02:30:46,914
...and betrayed me.

2142
02:30:47,038 --> 02:30:48,312
He maybe an imposter..

2143
02:30:48,439 --> 02:30:51,045

the CEO of such a big company.
