1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,590
'My granny used to say...'

2
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,210
'...relationships are like doors.'

3
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,340
'Every time you make
a new relationship...'

4
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,050
'...it opens new doors.'

5
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,130
'When a relationship breaks...'

6
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,000
'...the door closes.'

7
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,630
'But some doors we slam so hard...'

8
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,670
'...that they never really close,
they just keep swinging to and fro.'

9
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,630
'And we don't realize that
they remain slightly open.'

10
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,250
"Nights are hard to endure."

11
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,170
"My mind is bewildered."

12
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,050
"No one knows why."

13
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,420
"Like someone's cast a spell on my heart..."

14
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,460
"...which alleviates me from me."

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,460
"No one knows why."

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,130
"How do I narrate..."

17
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,460
"...or explain my crazy heart."

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,170
"Why the dewdrops
keep trickling down like a string?"

19
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,380
"Ishqeria."

20
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,920
"Ishqeria."

21
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,420
"Ishqeria."

22
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,750
"Ishqeria."

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,920
"Nights are hard to endure."

24
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,750
"My mind is bewildered."

25
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,630
"No one knows why."

26
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,090
"...which alleviates me from me."

27
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,130
"No one knows why."

28
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,710
"How do I narrate..."

29
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,090
"...or explain my crazy heart."

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,550
"Why the dew drops
keep trickling down like a string?"

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,090
"Ishqeria."

32
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,420
"Ishqeria."

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,880
"Ishqeria."

34
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,630
"Ishqeria."

35
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,750
Hi.

36
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:42,800
Hi.

37
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,210
Do you want something...

38
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,250
I want a divorce.

39
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,300
I didn't know why this
door was opening again.'

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,340
'But how did it close
in the first place?'

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,000
'This story began 7 years ago...'

42
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,500
'...when in some corner of Mussoorie,
Tapasya Heights...'

43
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,420
'... I was getting ready
to attend their biggest college.'

44
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,670
'And somewhere in Tapsee Heights,
our head boy, Raghav Dalmiya...'

45
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,210
'...was giving the welcome speech.'

46
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,550
All I want to say is
this isn't just a college...

47
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,130
...it's a universe on its own.

48
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,420
Because you won't just study here...

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,170
...but also become someone.

50
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,210
You won't spend just three years here.

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,630
You will live many moments.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,500
You'll learn some,
you'll unlearn some.

53
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,460
You'll fall...and get
up on your feet again.

54
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,250
But by the end of it all,
you'll be ready to take on the world.

55
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,130
I have just one 'mantra'.

56
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,500
Definitely party hard,
but work harder.

57
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,630
Because your present
will shape your future.

58
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Whether they make you laugh, or cry.
But you must always remember them.

59
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,300
Because if you can't remember them...

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,250
...then those are not memories.

61
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,170
One more thing...no ragging.

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,130
Let the music begin.

63
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,340
Raghav! Raghav! Raghav!

64
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,500
"The raging...winds."

65
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,090
"This wind...will usher in a change."

66
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,460
"This fresh...new wind."

67
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,550
"This wind will...definitely
do something."

68
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,420
'After rotting in an all-girls
school for 12 years...'

69
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,000
'...I was finally foraying into boys territory.'

70
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,050
'By God,
I was looking so hot that day...'

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,590
'...I was scared that I
might spark a riot in Mussoorie.'

72
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,550
"The world is ours..."

73
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:35,090
"...what more could we want
that's
better than this world?"

74
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,800
"Surrounded by jungles and mountains..."

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,420
"...oceans and rivers as well."

76
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,050
"We're like the raging winds."

77
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,210
"If you stop us from flowing..."

78
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,840
"...this raging wind
will do something unique."

79
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,300
"The world is ours..."

80
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:06,130
"...what more could we want
that's
better than this world?"

81
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,880
"No head or feet..."

82
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,460
"...going nowhere."

83
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,670
"Let's stop and think."

84
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,050
"These thoughts lead to many questions..."

85
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,050
"...someone just has to ask."

86
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,050
"When things go wrong,
something new is born."

87
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,460
"Since we're already wrong..."

88
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,800
"...let's turn into something new."

89
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,420
"The world is ours..."

90
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,050
"Everywhere we look belongs to us."

91
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,000
"We are the raging winds."

92
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,210
"Raging...winds."

93
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,750
"Making the youth soar high."

94
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,090
"The new winds..."

95
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:25,800
"Those winds are back again."

96
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,300
"Everyday on the steps, why sit and drool..."

97
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
"...like it was in school."

98
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,960
"It's new...Life's completely new."

99
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,750
"Give her a look,
just don't go by the book."

100
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,880
"It's my heart, let it stay mine."

101
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,590
"But you can borrow it for some time."

102
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,300
"My heart's like a balloon..."

103
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,750
"...it may burst some day."

104
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,500
"Look here comes the raging winds."

105
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,800
"The raging...winds."

106
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,380
"This wind...will usher in a new change."

107
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,670
"The raging...winds."

108
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,630
"Those winds are back again."

109
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,840
I've been praying since morning...

110
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
...that the other girl
doesn't show up. Sh**.

111
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,340
There's hardly any space for my stuff...

112
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,460
...how will we accommodate yours?
You can't.

113
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,590
But, I just have a small trunk.

114
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,630
My granny lives here.
I'll leave the rest of my stuff at her place.

115
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,460
And my trunk...can fit in here.

116
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,380
- And your shoes?
- I only have two pairs of shoes.

117
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,630
I'll keep them on top of the cupboard.

118
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,340
I love poor.

119
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,090
We're now best friends.

120
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,590
Luvlin Chaudhary
from Mata Sundari, Panipat.

121
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,250
Kuhu, from Harmandar Kaur, Jalandhar.

122
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,880
'And with this brief introduction,
Luvlin Chaudhary entered my life.'

123
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,170
'The most important character
in the drama, called life...'

124
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,000
'...after the handsome prince
and the misfit princess.'

125
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,840
- Even my father's name s Luvlin.
- Great.

126
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,500
He must be good looking, like me.

127
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,050
Him.

128
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,500
Why would anyone
want to learn from him?

129
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,050
- But if there's a hot girl...
- Come on. come...

130
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,800
Let's have tea.

131
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,130
The scent of Mussoorie.

132
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,550
Bro, make it really strong...

133
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,250
- ...so I can take a dump easily in the morning.
- You're quite open.

134
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,460
Mention not.

135
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,420
Dude, that's like unboiled water.

136
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,090
If you want mineral water in your tea...

137
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,500
...go to some hotel instead.

138
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,420
The first time you have
met your match. 10 on 10.

139
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,130
Here you are.

140
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,670
That's what you like.

141
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,960
Bro, she's definitely my match.

142
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,090
Because I've never
come across a man like her.

143
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,090
Listen...what's the color of your shit?

144
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,130
You're not my friend.

145
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,000
Have you heard this saying?

146
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,920
Bro, when a baby cries
in a faraway village...

147
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,500
...do you know what his mother says?

148
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,250
"Go to sleep or first-year
girls will come for you."

149
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,550
That's Because he hasn't seen us yet.

150
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,840
Freshers Party.

151
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,170
I'm scared to attend
the fresher's party.

152
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,590
No need to be scared.

153
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
What the...

154
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,130
Come, let's make you a man.

155
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,210
Where?

156
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,300
Hey, oily hair.

157
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,050
Yes, you.

158
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,550
Hello, ma'am.

159
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,880
See that sh** head.

160
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,340
Go up to him and...

161
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,420
Go up to him and say, ****.

162
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,670
Go on...we don't have all day.

163
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,550
Watch this. Watch this.

164
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,170
Close the book,
why are you always reading?

165
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,590
What is your problem?

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,300
It's an interesting book.

167
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
f...

168
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,130
****.

169
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,500
- Hey.
- What?

170
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,710
Do you know the consequences of raising
your tone in front of a third-year student?

171
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,550
I see...you're in the third year.

172
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,630
Sorry, I didn't know.

173
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,210
You see...I just joined
the third year today.

174
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,380
So I don't have any idea about it.

175
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Sh**

176
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,340
Run! Run!

177
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,840
Luvlu...

178
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,090
Welcome, Sambha. welcome.

179
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,170
Raise your dress.

180
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,210
What?

181
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,670
Lift your dress up...dude.

182
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,380
- Why?
- My wish.

183
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,800
There are only two places
where one can lift their dress up.

184
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,380
When you're with your hero,
or at the commode.

185
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,920
Which isn't the case here.

186
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,800
Amit...stop messing with the kids.

187
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,880
Don't be scared of them, please.

188
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,590
They are bigger wimps than you.

189
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,380
They all once did what they
are asking you to do. Right?

190
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,880
That's why every year they sit here...

191
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,840
...and take revenge from their juniors.

192
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Just do what they are saying.

193
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,880
And next year you'll be
sitting here scaring some junior.

194
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,750
- But the dress...
- You know what...

195
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,800
...think of them as
your commode and do it.

196
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,590
Or...or...

197
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,420
Think of him as your hero.

198
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,170
'Seniors wanted me
to lift my dress up...'

199
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,130
'...and run all over the
college yelling 'Floods'.

200
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
'And by God, I didn't mind at all.'

201
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,130
'Because there was a flood.'

202
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,670
'It wasn't just love...It
was full on Ishqeria.'

203
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,590
'And suddenly, instead of being
scared to attend the fresher's party...'

204
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,880
'...the excitement
was driving me crazy.'

205
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,920
Obviously.

206
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Lovely...why are they
wearing such boring clothes?

207
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,500
I thought we're supposed
to wear glittering frocks.

208
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,670
Bloody poor people, come on.

209
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,630
- Looking beautiful.
- Get lost.

210
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
What are you doing, baby?
I am still in the party.

211
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,750
- I was just laughing.
- Laughing at what?

212
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,000
Come with me...just come on.

213
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,300
She looks rich. And boys
are sticking to her like glue.

214
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,170
She's fair, laughs at stupid jokes...

215
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,380
...and wears next to nothing.
Custom made for boys.

216
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,460
So what? I was crowned Ms.
D Block in my society.

217
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,210
I see...and what was the prize...

218
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,420
...pink lipstick from
Sweety Cosmetics?

219
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,170
Hmm...

220
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,340
You better change your
opinion about yourself.

221
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,590
Look at these people.
Look at the ambiance.

222
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,000
We have to be cool...cool.

223
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,500
And how does one look cool?

224
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,420
Well...arch your back, tilt your head.

225
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,590
Always cover your
mouth with your hand...

226
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,960
...so that you don't scare people away.

227
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,920
And look closely...

228
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:27,550
Like this.

229
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,590
1...2...3...

230
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,340
1...2...3...

231
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Lovely, we kept laughing
all evening but no one noticed us.

232
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,670
They won't just notice us.

233
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,420
We'll have to grab their attention.

234
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,460
Watch closely...

235
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,460
Ouch...I dropped it.

236
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,630
I think this belongs to you.

237
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,710
Cream.

238
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,750
'Other than locking
Are you with my 'Hero'...

239
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,300
'...there were other explosions
which happened that night.'

240
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,050
'I met the other two
members of my future gang.'

241
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,050
'A silly Rajender Nath types comedian Vidhi Jain...'

242
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,670
'...and the other wannabe Lady Gaga,
Sue Menon.'

243
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,500
'Both were one of a kind,
like me and Luvlin.'

244
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,050
'And that's it...thus
our gang was formed.'

245
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,050
English Rap

246
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,590
English Rap

247
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,170
English Rap

248
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,710
English Rap

249
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,500
'And what happened later that night...'

250
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,960
'...is what we all still regret.'

251
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,380
I am now going to handout
chits to all of you.

252
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,670
And you must write down
the name of a boy who you like...

253
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,340
...and he's from this college.

254
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,170
And, the rest of the girls
will help her entice him.

255
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,500
And will he get enticed?

256
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,960
Is there anything
that Luvlin cannot do?

257
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,750
Kuhu, my love, let's begin with you.

258
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,090
Raghav.

259
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,340
Headboy, Raghav Dalmiya.

260
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,250
Yes...

261
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,210
Hold on, hold on, you mean the debate
society president, sports champ...

262
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,000
...best student, stud, Raghav Dalmiya.

263
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,750
Yes, him.

264
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,710
All he loves is knowledge and God.
And not humans.

265
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,960
Nonsense. I saw him
flirting with school girls.

266
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,840
Stupid...he gives tuitions so that he
doesn't have to take money from home.

267
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,670
- How do you know?
- Everyone knows this.

268
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,420
In Tapsee, Raghav's story is
distributed even before the syllabus.

269
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,710
His father was having an affair...

270
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,460
...and didn't want a child from his wife.
Your hero...

271
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,380
They were going to abort
him even before he was born.

272
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,800
But his mother gave
birth to him anyway...

273
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,210
...and died due to depression herself.

274
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,420
And mister...he doesn't even
give a second look to Ayesha.

275
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,840
Who do you think you are?

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,500
Ms. D Block.

277
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,000
Then why are we playing
this stupid game?

278
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,630
Is there anything that Luvlin
Chaudhary cannot do, my foot.

279
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,710
Challenge.

280
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,420
- To a Jattni?
- Yes.

281
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,420
We'll entice Raghav for Kuhu.

282
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,800
I swear on my mother.

283
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,380
We'll entice Raghav for Kuhu.

284
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:58,710
I swear on...Luvlin's mother.

285
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,710
We'll entice Raghav for Kuhu.

286
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,750
Swear on everyone's mother.

287
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
'Next day...we weren't high on alcohol,
but the madness.'

288
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,380
Now?

289
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,590
Sh**

290
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,500
You all swore on my mother,
you rascals. Nobody will back out.

291
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,130
But it's a difficult job,
how are we going to do it?

292
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,920
Shut up, you crybaby.

293
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,130
You make it sound like we're
trying to catch the Don.

294
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,630
He's a man after all...

295
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,380
...and, somethings are common
in all of them.

296
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,380
Like.

297
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,960
Like this, strategy no. 1,
you're going on a diet from today.

298
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,050
This is a game of love,
not a wrestling match.

299
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,630
Silly...you don't understand love.

300
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,460
I want to someone who loves my soul,
and not my body.

301
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,380
Yeah...

302
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,840
My child,
the soul is nestled in the body.

303
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,090
To look at the soul,
one must look at the body.

304
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:54,550
True point.

305
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,210
And your body...

306
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,750
Hmm...

307
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,050
- Here you go.
- But this is for cattle.

308
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,130
Kuhu, sorry to break it to you...

309
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,250
...but even you look like cattle.

310
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,670
What? I don't want
to lose too much weight.

311
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,800
It's the only thing I have.
My two rare gems.

312
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,210
If I lose too much weight,
I'll lose them too.

313
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,550
Get lost... You will never
lose that much weight.

314
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,170
Just lose some weight around
your thighs and love handle.

315
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,840
That's all.

316
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Will you two shut up?
I can't concentrate.

317
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,590
Ms. Jain.

318
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,460
Ms. Jain.

319
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,210
- Get up.
- But, ma'am.

320
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,800
No, please get out of my class.

321
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,210
- Ma'am, I'm really sorry, please.
- No, you just get out of my class.

322
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,460
And take your group also.

323
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Sorry, ma'am.

324
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,300
Sorry. Sorry for her.

325
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,170
How long are you going to keep crying?

326
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,710
Where's your best friend?
She's always missing.

327
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,550
Does she have a boyfriend?

328
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,250
No.

329
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,340
Then go get her. Go on.

330
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,340
I'll do all that,
what are you guys going to do?

331
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,210
We?

332
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,130
We're going to do what
even boys are scared to do.

333
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,050
We're going to be spies.

334
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,880
I'll be the head, of course.
And these two will be my assistant.

335
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,710
We'll keep a watch over
Raghav Dalmiya round-the-clock.

336
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,500
What he likes, who and why.

337
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,590
What he eats,
wears, and his lifestyle.

338
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,550
We'll make a note of everything.

339
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,500
And then suddenly, coincidentally...

340
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,460
Thanks to a beautiful coincidence,
you'll start taking interest in everything...

341
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,090
...that Raghav does.

342
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,420
And then...

343
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,630
No matter how hard he tries...

344
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,880
...he will have to notice you some day.

345
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:45,840
And then?

346
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,800
Then one day he'll say...

347
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,380
'I began preparing to
fight the battle of love.'

348
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,670
The game,
ladies and gentlemen had begun.'

349
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,590
"This is where...memories are created."

350
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,420
"This is where...friendships are made."

351
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,090
"Conversations, big or small..."

352
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,710
"Days are short...but nights are not."

353
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,800
- "This is where...
- Sweet memories."

354
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,750
- "...memories are created.
- Of college."

355
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,800
- "This is where...
- Like you and me."

356
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,300
- "...friendships are made.
- Forever."

357
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,500
"We'll never let go,
says these moments."

358
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,210
"We'll blossom into
beautiful flowers."

359
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,500
- "This is where...
- Sweet memories."

360
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,250
- "...memories are created.
- Of college."

361
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,380
- "This is where...
- Like you and me."

362
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,630
"...friendships are made."

363
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,420
Spare me something, sir.
God will bless you.

364
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,500
"Don't be fooled by my beauty, dear."

365
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:54,550
"Don't be fooled by my beauty, dear."

366
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,590
"My tears are crazy, beloved..."

367
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,420
"...but the mind is smart."

368
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,500
"This beauty is very naughty..."

369
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,340
"...stuck with me like a sore in my throat.

370
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,300
- "This is where...
- Forever."

371
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,380
- "...memories are created.
- Like you and me.."

372
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,630
"This is where...memories someplace."

373
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,880
"This is where...memories dabbling."

374
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,590
"This is where...friendships effect."

375
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,630
"Conversations, big or small..."

376
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,170
"Days are short...but nights are not."

377
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,090
- "This is where...
- Sweet memories."

378
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,880
- "...memories are created.
- Of college."

379
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,090
- "This is where...
- Like you and me."

380
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,920
"...friendships are made."

381
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,590
Sue...what's taking you so long?
Open up.

382
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,460
- Did she have a radish?
- No, pumpkin.

383
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,050
By the way,
I've made a stunning discovery.

384
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,590
Every morning at 7:30 he goes jogging,
at the tracks downstairs.

385
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,500
And from tomorrow she will too.
So cute.

386
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,340
Dirty girl.

387
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,130
"This is where...memories are created."

388
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,880
"This is where...friendships are made."

389
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,340
"Conversations, big or small..."

390
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,710
"Days are short...but nights are not."

391
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,130
"This is where...memories are created."

392
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,630
"This is where...friendships are made."

393
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,920
"Conversations, big or small..."

394
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:17,420
"Days are short...but nights are not."

395
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,170
- "This is where...
- Sweet memories."

396
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,000
- "...memories are created.
- Of college."

397
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,210
- "This is where...
- Like you and me."

398
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,420
"...friendships are made."

399
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,750
You don't breathe properly.

400
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,380
You can run faster
if you breathe properly.

401
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,880
Go, go...

402
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,460
- Thank you.
- Welcome, sir.

403
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,250
Excuse me!

404
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,500
- Hi.
- Hi...

405
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,000
Why don't you teach me?

406
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,300
What?

407
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,170
Breathing. You breathe so well.

408
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,920
Oh...okay.

409
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,210
You know that wall
in front of our college...

410
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,420
...let's meet on that bench
in front of it.

411
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,340
Yes.

412
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,250
- Okay.
- Yeah, whatever.

413
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,840
Okay.

414
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,050
Bye.

415
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,590
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

416
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,130
Oh yeah.

417
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,590
Oh, God.

418
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,840
- Is she okay?
- Look, look...

419
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
At least he's helping her.

420
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,800
At least he's helping her.
At least he's touching her.

421
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,630
- You're okay.
- Yeah, I am fine. I am fine.

422
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,710
Shall we begin?

423
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,050
Yeah.

424
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,210
Okay, arch your back, like upright.

425
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,170
Yeah, very good. Hands on your legs.

426
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,300
And look straight. And start.

427
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,170
He's doing something.
Something's happening.

428
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,670
Very good. Yeah...

429
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,340
I think you've got it.

430
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,710
Remember this,
and follow the same pattern tomorrow.

431
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,670
Okay.

432
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:23,800
Like this?

433
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,460
- No, no. The other way.
- Which way?

434
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,670
Breathe out... The other way.

435
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,250
You were doing it
properly a minute ago.

436
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,880
I learned it so soon,
that I can't remember.

437
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,130
Can we do another
session tomorrow?

438
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,090
I see...

439
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,250
I had some doubts.

440
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,590
Take it from me, all the first
year students this time are loco.

441
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,880
Big teeth, weird gait...and their names.

442
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,340
They sound more like truck drivers.

443
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,670
Luvlin Chaudhary...Kuhu Singh...

444
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,090
I mean, give them a pant and a shirt...

445
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,380
...and they will confuse everyone.

446
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,750
Dude seriously, these are not females.

447
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,460
They are just non-males.

448
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:23,590
So you're going to see her again.
Train her on how to breathe.

449
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,170
Weren't you scared talking to her?

450
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,840
Stop being mean, man.

451
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,250
- Raghav.
- Hello, uncle.

452
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm going to Delhi for a few days.
For business.

453
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,000
Do you need money?

454
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,840
For the last ten years, I never asked you
where you're going or for what purpose?

455
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,420
And, I don't need your money.
Thank you.

456
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:01,380
That's a good thing.
Self-respect runs in our blood.

457
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:09,050
- I am glad you inherited it.
- I've inherited nothing, Mr. Dalmiya.

458
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,300
Nothing.

459
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,840
I've learned to endure like my mother.

460
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,300
It's not easy to live with a man...

461
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,210
...who wanted to kill
me even before I was born.

462
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,000
- I am off...
- Raghav.

463
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,840
Dude...you're filled with so much rage?

464
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,840
Is there a factory inside?

465
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,380
All the heirs of Dalmiya
family inherits it.

466
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,750
It's been 21 years.

467
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,880
Come on,
I mean by now you should've just...

468
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,710
And that's what makes me angry.

469
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,880
Even after 21 one years, I am still living
with that man under the same roof.

470
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,250
I don't make enough
money from tuitions...

471
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,130
...to have my own place.

472
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,630
And that's why I am waiting
for that scholarship.

473
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,920
I need it.

474
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,630
I just want to get
out of that sh** hole.

475
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,300
I've told you this before,
move in with me at my place.

476
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,500
Your place? Is there a place for me?

477
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,460
On the terrace.

478
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,170
Let me check mine. Come on.

479
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,380
Raghav, Salma, Aabas Shaik.

480
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,050
Oh, God...

481
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,800
Raghav got first place.

482
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,170
- Congratulations, Raghav.
- Thank you, sir.

483
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,500
I'll join you guys later.

484
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,500
Raghav...man, people are still
looking for their name on the board...

485
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,250
...and you don't look happy
even though you topped the list.

486
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,920
What's your problem, man?

487
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,130
It's become a habit.

488
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,340
I mean work hard every year,
come here, see my name on the list...

489
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,800
...and go back home.

490
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,130
The real achievement would've been
when it made a difference to someone.

491
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,590
If only my mother was still alive...

492
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,800
...she would've given me a big hug and
said; "Bravo son, I am proud of you".

493
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,460
Bravo son, I am proud of you.

494
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,420
Have you lost your mind?

495
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,050
What are you laughing at? Come on?

496
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,550
I know I am good looking
and all of that, but still...

497
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,960
What's her name?
Ayesha. Take her for instance.

498
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,250
We went out a couple times on a date...

499
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,800
...but now she's after me.
I don't know what to do.

500
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,920
But...she's been chasing me.

501
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,210
Excuse me. Kuhu.

502
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,590
Kuhu!

503
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,630
Hello... Hi.

504
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,500
Hi.

505
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,550
I was saying...

506
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:15,670
You mentioned that you
wanted another breathing class.

507
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,840
- Yeah...
- Yeah...

508
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,590
So I was saying that... I mean,
if you don't mind...

509
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,090
...can we do it in the clubhouse?

510
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,960
Yes, of course.

511
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,750
Sure.

512
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

513
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,000
- Breathing.
- Okay.

514
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,300
I'll see you.

515
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:53,090
I just changed the venue,
but we'll still do the same thing.

516
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,670
Breathing coaching.

517
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,380
- Breathing coaching.
- Yes.

518
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,500
And since it will be dinner time,
we can't stay hungry.

519
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,130
We'll just eat dinner together,
that's all.

520
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,550
You even sleep alone every day.

521
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,630
Why don't you two even
do that together? Okay.

522
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,090
Stop blabbering, you know.

523
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,340
You too.

524
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,090
Call him like this.

525
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,800
Ms. D Block, you'll look sexy.

526
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,840
And ask for money when you leave.

527
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
And maintain an attitude.

528
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,210
No need agree with him all the time.

529
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,420
And please,
don't call him sir.

530
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,340
Okay.

531
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,880
Rascal, you never
took me to the clubhouse.

532
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,090
Stop ranting about the clubhouse.

533
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,590
Jacket! You're wearing a jacket.

534
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
What's wrong with a jacket?

535
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,130
In 21 years of our friendship,
you never wore a suit for me.

536
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,170
Suit...jacket...

537
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,800
Raghav, perfume as well.

538
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,590
You never wore perfume for me.

539
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,590
Well, I never looked at you that way.

540
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,250
You mean...you look
at Kuhu Singh that way.

541
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,920
No...that's not what I meant.

542
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,750
- Then what did you mean?
- I meant that...

543
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,960
- What did you mean?
- I meant that...

544
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,210
That...that...

545
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,460
- You're confusing me.
- Raghav. Raghav.

546
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,420
- Pimple.
- Don't touch it.

547
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,800
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

548
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,800
Hold on.

549
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,800
- This looks nice, doesn't it?
- It's nice.

550
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,960
Beautiful.

551
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,550
Raghav, so you're going.

552
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,800
Listen... fine, you can go.

553
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,210
But don't you dare
take more than 30 minutes.

554
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,500
Listen...don't keep ranting
about a deadline like boring women.

555
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,170
Take at least 30 minutes
to build an ambiance.

556
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:43,880
Okay.

557
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,300
- How much?
- 30 minutes.

558
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,130
You love shopping
but hate video games.

559
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,500
Say that you love video
games and hate shopping.

560
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,710
Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge'
is your favorite film.

561
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,380
And you don't like
Kareena Kapoor at all.

562
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,590
Gladiator is your favorite film...

563
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,170
...and Kareena's not bad.

564
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,710
Talk less and listen more.

565
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,710
And no matter what,
don't look in her eyes.

566
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,090
That's where all the mess begin.

567
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,750
Talk less and listen more.

568
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,710
And no matter what, look in his eyes.

569
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,750
That's where all the mess begin.

570
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,550
Let's go.

571
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,960
By the way, I didn't expect
this from you...

572
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,590
Are you crazy?

573
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,670
But still,
go Simran and live your life.

574
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,380
And listen, no need to be decent or formal.

575
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,460
And may history remember you as the
first woman to set foot into this clubhouse...

576
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,800
...with the most popular, the most dashing,
the richest bachelor in all of Mussoorie.

577
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,800
I will.

578
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,590
Go.

579
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:08,590
Go on.

580
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,710
- First time wearing heels.
- I know.

581
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,500
- Look straight.
- She will fall.

582
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,960
Oh, my goodness.

583
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,500
That's for you.

584
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,300
- Please have a seat, sir.
- Thank you.

585
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,840
Come.

586
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Thank you.

587
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,500
- Sir.
- Thank you.

588
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,710
What will you have?

589
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,710
One veg clear soup, no carbs at night.

590
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,460
Oh, nice.

591
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,800
Same here.

592
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,300
But I am really hungry tonight,
So I guess I'm going to eat today.

593
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,300
Me too.

594
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,460
I haven't eaten anything
since morning to look slim.

595
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,050
Something not very fattening,
of course.

596
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,050
Okay.

597
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,670
One minced meat stuffed bread,
tempered lentil with extra butter.

598
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,420
By the way,
what else do you like?

599
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,630
Me.

600
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,500
Well, there's hardly
anything that I don't like.

601
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:39,840
Lazing around, chatting, playing pranks
on people, eating chips, drinking rum...

602
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,670
...and bowing every morning,
before Sridevi.

603
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,920
- Sridevi? Why?
- She is God.

604
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,670
She can make you laugh,
she can make you cry...

605
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,750
...she can be a serpent,
a fairy, make the hero fall in love...

606
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,550
...and fool the villain.

607
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,380
Only God can have all these qualities.

608
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,050
You're very filmy, aren't you?

609
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,670
God created only two good things.
Films and me.

610
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:09,090
What kind of girls do you like?

611
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,750
It's so funny,
I never thought about it.

612
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:25,920
But I guess she should beautiful,
fit, and...

613
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,630
long, beautiful hair.

614
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,210
She should be smart.

615
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,590
But I guess... Yeah...

616
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,960
I think most importantly
she should be able to make me laugh.

617
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,880
You know, someone with whom...

618
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,300
...I can be a child
even when I grow old.

619
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,420
Because...I missed that, completely.

620
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,590
It's not a bus that you missed.

621
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:56,500
Just because you grew tall,
doesn't mean your childhood is over.

622
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:01,250
Chill out...drink cold buttermilk,
stay away from things you don't like...

623
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,210
...and take what you like.

624
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,170
And you're in your childhood again.

625
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,340
What kind of a guy do you want?

626
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,250
Me...

627
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,880
Well, I have a very small requirement.

628
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,130
I am a foodie... So someone who
doesn't comment on my eating habits.

629
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,090
And sings a song for
me with tears in his eyes.

630
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,460
With tears in his eyes?

631
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,210
Why?

632
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,710
Doesn't it give you that
'romantic' kind of a feeling?

633
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:35,590
Candy floss, romance, drama,
ice-cream, rains... I'll be floored.

634
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,710
Would you like an ice-cream?

635
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,380
I won't stop you.

636
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:22,880
"The moment I see you...is
worth cherishing for me."

637
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,050
"When you're not around,
there's a darkness surrounding me."

638
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:32,920
"You light up my mornings."

639
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:37,750
"You dwell in my dreams..."

640
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,750
"You're the one who
dwells in my heart."

641
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:47,710
"And in my restless arms."

642
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:52,750
"You are in my sights."

643
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:23,800
"The moment I see you...is
worth cherishing for me."

644
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,340
I am getting used to you, Kuhu.

645
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,800
Used to being happy.

646
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,420
It wasn't easy for our hearts to unite as one.

647
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,670
Under any circumstances,
please don't betray me.

648
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:14,460
Don't ever lie to me. Okay.

649
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:24,590
"You're the one I prayed for..."

650
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:29,380
"...you're my first wish."

651
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,750
"You're the one I prayed for..."

652
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,500
"...you're my first wish."

653
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,630
"Your grace lights up every moment..."

654
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:54,670
"You're the one who
makes my heart blossom."

655
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,130
"You're the one who
makes my heart blossom."

656
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:04,800
"You're the one who
makes my heart blossom."

657
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:14,500
"You dwell in my path
of love... and in my attitude."

658
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:57,750
"You dwell in my
dreams...you don't know."

659
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:13,210
"You dwell in my
dreams...you don't know."

660
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:18,460
"How do I make you believe..."

661
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,420
"...you're closest to my heart."

662
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:28,460
"...you're closest to my heart."

663
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:33,460
"...you're closest to my heart."

664
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:38,210
"You're the frivolity
of the ambiance."

665
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:43,000
"You're in all my prayers."

666
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:13,670
'And I was officially
Raghav Dalmiya's girlfriend.'

667
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:18,170
'My dress sense got better,
Even my marks got better.'

668
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,840
'Because I was always
with this bookworm.'

669
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,300
'But poor boy was stressed
about his interview.'

670
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,840
'Which was on 20th March.'

671
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:27,750
'The one with Harvard...'

672
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,090
'...due to which we couldn't
meet for a couple of days.'

673
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,170
'And during this time,
inspired by his hard work...'

674
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,210
'...even I took up a
job at granny's bookshop.'

675
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,460
- Hi.
- Hi...

676
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,300
Your father was here some time ago.

677
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,420
He's ordered some
very expensive books.

678
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:50,880
Which one? Adultery and abortion.

679
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,050
No. Wine Wealth
and Plantation Planner.

680
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,460
And he even made a fat donation
to our 'Let Your Child Read' campaign.

681
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,920
Tell him to start a 'Let
Your Child Be' campaign as well.

682
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:08,840
my-my...

683
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:14,800
Hasn't anybody ever thought you
to say; "It's okay, I forgive you".

684
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:15,840
What to do?

685
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,250
He threw my mother out...

686
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,000
...and he was in no position
to say these things himself.

687
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,590
life is so much bigger, Raghav.

688
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,460
I admit what he did was wrong, but...

689
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,250
Hello... why did your face turn pale?

690
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,210
Are you forgetting something?

691
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:47,840
What?

692
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,250
You're supposed to
ask me something, Kuhu?.

693
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,590
- What day is it today?
- Monday.

694
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,550
- So?
- So...

695
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,750
Raghav!

696
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,250
Raghav! Raghav!
Raghav! Listen to me, please.

697
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,460
Raghav!

698
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:26,880
Raghav!

699
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:30,460
Raghav! I remember it's
your interview today.

700
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,170
Thanks.

701
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:33,460
I am obliged.

702
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,340
Thanks to Mr. Dalmiya...

703
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,460
You forgot about the
most important day in my life.

704
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:38,460
Right?

705
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,920
I didn't do it intentionally, Raghav.

706
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:44,340
Of course, Because Mr.
Dalmiya is very important for you.

707
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,750
- Now you're over-reacting, Raghav.
- Yes, you're right.

708
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,130
You're right, Kuhu.
I am over-reacting.

709
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,000
I've been waiting for this
day for 21 years... which was today.

710
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,000
Raghav, I am sorry.

711
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,550
A goddamn regular,
same regular Monday.

712
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,420
No difference at all.

713
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,210
I don't know why, but...I thought that...

714
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:20,340
...this Monday would
be different for you.

715
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,750
- It would be what...it was for me.
- It is, I am sorry.

716
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,420
No sorry.

717
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,800
'And my hero left.'

718
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,380
Raghav, please don't go.

719
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,500
'But this wasn't
the twist in our story.'

720
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:40,630
'Hang on...granny also
used to say that...'

721
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,590
'There's a time for
every truth to be revealed.'

722
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,170
'So patience.'

723
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,380
'Thank God at least I have my gang.'

724
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,630
'As always, a lot has changed
in 7 years. Even our friendship.'

725
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,250
'We're no longer friends.
We're soul-sisters.'

726
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,800
Hey...Niagara Falls.

727
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:00,420
Raghav Dalmiya is a stupid man.

728
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,130
And he left Mussoorie
for a very stupid reason.

729
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,500
And he's returned
for a stupider reason.

730
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:11,050
And please don't say "I told
you, he will come back one day".

731
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:14,170
Please, dear...there are some
people who still believe I love.

732
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,090
Did Raghav come back for me?

733
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,130
Oh, God.

734
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,210
Will someone please get her married.

735
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,420
I was scared that she
might run off with the uncle.

736
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,880
Like I care. At least that
will be some adventure in life.

737
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,880
And some people are still stuck in the
same place for the past seven years.

738
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,630
Forget it, sister. Let me tell you,
things never happen the way we want.

739
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:33,960
I mean, look at me.

740
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,840
Back in college,
I was Sue Menon the rockstar.

741
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,500
And now, Mrs. Sue Banerjee,
and before all of you guys.

742
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:42,550
I mean, who would've thought.

743
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:47,500
In fact, things happen in
the exact opposite of what we think.

744
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,800
- It's true.
- Hottie.

745
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:50,840
I think there's no point of thinking.

746
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:52,670
Life always stays the way it is.

747
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:55,460
I was smart back then, I still am...

748
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,670
...and I'll always be smart.

749
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,880
- Right.
- Right.

750
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,500
She was crying back then, still is...

751
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,960
...and will always keep crying.

752
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,170
Hey...I just saw Raghav.

753
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,170
He was slow back then, still is...

754
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,300
- ...and always will be slow.
- Will you shut up?

755
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,500
I am talking to Kuhu.

756
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,710
Kuhu, I swear I think
I just saw Raghav.

757
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
I know.

758
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,210
What do you mean you know? And...

759
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,170
And you didn't tell me.

760
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:30,130
- I didn't get an opportunity?
- opportunity? Are you kidding me, Kuhu?

761
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,340
Raghav Dalmiya's returned
to Mussoorie after 7 years.

762
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:40,960
And you need an opportunity to tell me this.

763
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:47,880
Well done, Kuhu. Well done.

764
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:53,210
You know what, I think you're positively
hiding something from me, Kuhu.

765
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,710
Oh ho Raghav, can't you see...

766
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:05,380
Amit. Amit...I am so sorry, Amit.

767
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,550
Amit. Amit.

768
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Amit, stop. Please.

769
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,090
I am sorry. I am really sorry, Amit.

770
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,130
I love you, man.

771
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,840
I'll be right back.

772
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,460
- Uncle, three more.
- Okay, son.

773
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,500
Uncle, three large
pegs for me as well.

774
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,380
Okay.

775
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,500
- How are you, uncle?
- I am great, son.

776
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,920
- Uncle, four more.
- Four more.

777
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,710
Here you go.

778
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,800
Tell these wimps they
don't have to show off.

779
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:16,460
And tell crybabies...sometimes
we hit the jackpot.

780
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,750
Hey man, listen.
I don't talk to strangers...

781
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,000
- ...so can you please cut the crap.
- Listen, man.

782
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:28,050
I am back after seven years,
so...shut your trap.

783
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,380
Why did you come back?

784
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,090
I didn't call you back.

785
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,090
No phone calls,
messages or emails in 7 years.

786
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,550
Even if I was dead,
you wouldn't have known.

787
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:49,000
He won't die so easily, uncle.

788
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:57,500
At least 5 marriages...10
extra-marital affairs.

789
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:06,500
15... What's it called? Women
exploitation...and, 4 years in jail...

790
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:11,500
...and he won't die without all that.

791
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,380
- How are you?
- Dude...

792
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:25,460
leaving the city so abruptly.

793
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,420
Then you disappeared for 7 years.

794
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,090
sh*** on our 21 years of friendship.

795
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,750
Forget it.

796
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,420
That chapter is over.

797
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,750
You're treating our
lives like a storybook.

798
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,340
fu***

799
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,800
***** your chapter!

800
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:59,880
You married her, dude.
You married her.

801
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,380
Everyone makes one mistake, okay.

802
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,050
One mistake.

803
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:13,130
- Even Kuhu made a mistake.
- She made many mistakes.

804
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,500
She almost... She almost
bloody ruined my life, man.

805
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:23,460
Almost, huh...but she didn't.

806
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:30,670
Your life is exactly the
way you wanted it to be, Raghav.

807
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,000
You haven't changed at all.

808
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:38,880
Bloody rascal...

809
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,710
And you must be Amit.

810
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:48,130
Raghav says one who
curses the most is Amit.

811
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,340
The bold image of a bold India.

812
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,500
Bachelor Bajaj, right.

813
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,420
That's Radhika.

814
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:06,170
Radhika Bakshi.

815
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,130
My fiancee.

816
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,130
Hi, nice to meet you.

817
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,550
- Hi.
- Hi.

818
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,420
Wait, wait, I know. You're Aisha.

819
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,500
Aisha the college hottie, right.

820
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:31,630
Hi.

821
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,550
I am Kuhu actually.

822
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh...

823
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,630
Kuhu, Radhika.

824
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,210
Radhika, Kuhu.

825
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:47,130
Raghav talks a lot about you.

826
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,550
Really.

827
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,420
He hasn't mentioned you at all.

828
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,050
You said she isn't beautiful at all.

829
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:24,000
She's bloody hot.

830
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,710
Is this the end of my story?

831
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,840
Radhika,
why are you always so dramatic?

832
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:37,380
But tell me, Raghav...love without
a little drama isn't love at all.

833
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,210
'Raghav.'

834
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,250
'Raghav.'

835
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,550
'Raghav.'

836
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,210
Raghav. Raghav.
Raghav. I said I am sorry.

837
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:57,340
Come on ...can't a person make mistake?

838
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,880
Raghav.

839
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:05,000
Raghav, I am saying sorry. Please...

840
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,210
It's not like I killed someone.

841
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,000
I said I am sorry.

842
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,170
look, I won't stop chasing
you until you don't forgive me.

843
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,590
Come on, Raghav.
Even girls don't play so hard to get.

844
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,050
Please.

845
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,000
The first point is...

846
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:32,250
"The moment I see you...is
worth cherishing for me."

847
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:39,420
"When you're not around,
there's a darkness surrounding me."

848
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:44,090
"You light up my mornings."

849
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:49,250
"You dwell in my dreams..."

850
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:54,210
"You're the one who
dwells in my heart."

851
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,380
"And in my restless arms."

852
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,210
"You are in my sights."

853
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,750
Stop. Stop. Stop.

854
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,460
Can you please forgive me now?

855
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:37,300
Forgive you...

856
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,880
After this stupid act,
everyone will forgive you.

857
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,500
And anyway, I cannot endure
your beautiful voice anymore.

858
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,800
Did he say yes or not?

859
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,960
Now let's go.

860
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:19,300
"The gang's here...to taste
the sweet lumps of Mussoorie."

861
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:24,500
"You'll get caught red-handed..."

862
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,170
"...if say no again."

863
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:42,300
"Jeans pant and top...we're
gonna play Holi."

864
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:48,840
"Colours on your Kurta,
we're gonna play Holi."

865
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:53,380
"Clothes get shorter and shorter..."

866
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,590
"...canopies make you
cross all boundaries."

867
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:58,670
"As I strip slowly..."

868
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,590
"...we're going to play Holi."

869
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:08,460
"Jeans pant and top...we're
gonna play Holi."

870
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:15,750
"Colours on your Kurta,
we're gonna play Holi."

871
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,210
"Don't spray those
colors on me from afar..."

872
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,340
"...like a bullet from a gun."

873
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,960
"I am crazy about you, dear..."

874
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,840
"...screaming and yelling happy Holi."

875
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:55,840
"The gang of milkmaids
are staring at Krishna."

876
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,800
"Mix some canopies in
the pot filled with butter."

877
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:07,710
"Jeans pant and top...we're
gonna play Holi."

878
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,500
"Colours on your Kurta,
we're gonna play Holi."

879
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,170
"Don't let anyone
come to their senses..."

880
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,210
"...or speak another word."

881
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:54,500
"Beat the drums so hard
that we sway to its tune."

882
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:58,210
"Immersed in colors
and high on canopies..."

883
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,460
"...let me do what I want."

884
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,300
"Tomorrow when I am sober again..."

885
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,750
"...I'll think about
what happened to me."

886
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:13,300
"Jeans pant and top...we're
gonna play Holi."

887
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:20,250
"Colours on your Kurta,
we're gonna play Holi."

888
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,300
"Let's go play Holi."

889
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:32,460
- "Girls are naive...
- Boys are going to play Holi."

890
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:45,210
- "Girls are naive...
- Boys are going to play Holi."

891
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:02,380
- Happy Holi!
- Please, please, please, no colors.

892
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:06,050
- I am not in the mood.
- What are you saying? You're not in the mood?

893
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,130
We would be surprised if
you were in the mood to play Holi.

894
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,920
What is this? We're just dabbling
colors on each other like old aunts.

895
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:13,750
Can we have some real Holi, please?

896
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,420
We've all turned into aunts.

897
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,500
It's Holi dude,
how did our gang become so boring?

898
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,500
It's the effect of Mussoorie, dear.

899
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,670
This city spoils everyone.

900
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,340
Then go away.

901
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,750
No need to come here
every year for me.

902
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,630
Don't flatter yourself, Kuhu.
I only come here to smoke.

903
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:33,130
Since it's not allowed at home.

904
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:36,250
And I come here to find a husband.
Someday I will find him.

905
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:39,460
And...I come here to
get away from my husband.

906
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,170
Whenever I want to feel young again...

907
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,340
...I mean, what's better than Tapsee.

908
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:46,800
I come here to play, Holi.
No one else plays with dung!

909
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:50,000
- What are you doing?
- All you guys.

910
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:53,500
My tragedy queen,
don't you get dehydrated?

911
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:54,250
Seriously.

912
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,210
By the way,
I knew we were going to come to this.

913
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,550
- That's why...
- Party time.

914
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:04,380
I thought so too... That's
why I came along too.

915
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,210
What are you looking at?

916
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:13,300
I was entitled to this cafe long
before all of you. Bloody juniors.

917
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,670
And I had to come.

918
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:24,550
I haven't played Holi for so long.
I thought Raghav didn't like it.

919
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,460
His fiancee.

920
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,550
But is there anything
better than Holi?

921
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,800
You guys talk too much.

922
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,460
Let's start with
a drinking game first.

923
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,130
I stopped drinking.

924
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,630
I see...and which number
bottle is this? Fifth!

925
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,880
This is my first.

926
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,500
Amit.

927
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:47,500
Why don't you drink this?

928
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,380
This is Mussoorie's best liquor,
it's got alcohol. You don't know.

929
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,000
Come on.

930
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,840
- How are you?
- You will never find this stuff in Boston.

931
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,590
You asked, now I am better.

932
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,630
Your book shop...didn't change at all.

933
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,960
In a good way.

934
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,130
It's nice.

935
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:05,210
You haven't changed
either...in a good way.

936
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,340
This is our room.

937
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:13,340
Get 10 plates of chowmien.

938
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,670
But my exams are coming up.

939
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:19,590
How dare you argue with the seniors.
Come on, get lost.

940
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,380
- You've changed a lot.
- People change.

941
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:29,090
Nothing much has changed in this room.

942
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:32,300
Except for the stench of bookworms.

943
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,710
The press has changed.
The Chowmein won't taste the same.

944
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,800
You guys cooked chowmein on the press.

945
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,090
Not always.

946
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,420
Sometimes we would boil
it in the geyser, right?

947
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:46,050
You guys never went out and
ate cooked food?

948
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,500
We never had money.

949
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:50,380
But you do now.
So I have a great idea.

950
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,090
I am really hungry.

951
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,880
So why don't we go to
someplace nice, relaxed.

952
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:59,300
Let's eat Italian. Whose with me?

953
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:06,590
Or why don't we sit here, on the floor,
and eat chowmein together from the same plate.

954
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:07,630
Who is with me?

955
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,130
I am in for that.

956
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:11,880
I am in for that for sure.

957
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,670
Well, we don't get chowmein in Boston.

958
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,460
I mean the one you
get in Tapsee Heights.

959
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:23,050
We'll have Italian tonight, okay.

960
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,050
- Looking nice, right.
- I bought it from Delhi.

961
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:32,130
You've turned into a complete NRI.

962
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,630
What did you say inside?

963
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,670
You don't get Chowmein
noodles in Boston.

964
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,670
How does that make me NRI?

965
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,000
I mean...you really don't get
Chowmein noodles in Boston. Honestly.

966
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,170
- I don't believe it.
- Raghav.

967
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,130
Foreigner.

968
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,420
You're talking nonsense.

969
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,880
So tell me what else
you don't get there?

970
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,460
I am sure there's a lot
of thing, you don't get there?

971
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:09,210
Like...the fragrance of mother-earth.
like this shovel, cattle, naked saints.

972
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:11,090
Naked saints and all.

973
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:13,670
- Bajrang Bali.
- Bajrang Bali, huh.

974
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,590
Stop taking my kiss,
I don't have that accent.

975
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:16,420
I see...

976
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500
Then repeat everything you
said in Hindi.

977
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,420
Are you serious?

978
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,750
- Yeah.
- In Hindi.

979
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,090
- Yeah.
- Give me a minute.

980
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,300
Stop f**** with me.

981
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,460
Correct.

982
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,500
And, I don't have an accent.

983
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:35,050
I mean... what's accent called in Hindi?

984
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:35,920
Accent...

985
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,590
Stop laughing, even you don't know.

986
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,250
Let's go ask that bald
foreigner In Mr. India.

987
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,710
He used to act as the foreigner
in all the Hindi films. - Yes.

988
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,710
My Bajrang Bali. My Bajrang Bali.

989
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,880
You're still here.
I didn't notice, sorry.

990
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,710
Why?

991
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:54,340
What changed in the
last three minutes...

992
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,750
...that you didn't notice
our three-year-old relationship?

993
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,460
Relax Radhika, you're embarrassing me.
You're overreacting.

994
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,500
I am embarrassing you.

995
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,420
I've been calling you
for the last five minutes...

996
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,300
...and you didn't hear me,
and I am over-reacting.

997
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,420
Stop it.

998
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:21,050
She won't sign so easily, Raghav.

999
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:28,090
She has a habit of
always ruining your plans.

1000
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,300
Radhika, stop it.

1001
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,090
Stop what?
She's not going to sign.

1002
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:32,130
Shut up.

1003
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,800
Lord, please save me this time.
Please...

1004
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:16,800
I made a mistake.
I'll never make this mistake again.

1005
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,380
How will I go home? Please...

1006
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,000
What happened? What happened?

1007
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,880
I missed my period, Luvlu.

1008
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,460
Wait.

1009
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,800
- What's...
- Wait, Kuhu.

1010
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,300
Wait, Kuhu.

1011
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:42,090
Kuhu.

1012
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,300
What will you do if
this happens with you?

1013
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:51,300
Can you tell everyone?
Can you go back to Panipat?

1014
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,090
Can you tell your mom-dad...

1015
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,630
- Mom-dad...
- Kuhu.

1016
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:58,000
There's a solution
for this kind of problems.

1017
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,460
There's a clinic on Mall Road.

1018
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,420
We'll go there and get an abortion...

1019
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:43,960
I hate that word.

1020
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,500
But I love you.

1021
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:19,750
Hey...what are you thinking?

1022
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:25,000
That...what a weird marriage this is.

1023
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:31,460
No music, no relatives,
no wedding saree or henna.

1024
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:32,710
I knew it.

1025
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,420
Oh, God.
Tears on the henna are bad luck.

1026
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:02,710
Hi.

1027
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,550
Tears on holi colors are bad luck.

1028
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,880
Relax Radhika,
your mind is over-working.

1029
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:43,630
And your's is rusting.

1030
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:48,250
I mean, come on...didn't
you see their body language.

1031
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Their chemistry.

1032
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:53,250
Are you really that naive?

1033
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:10,420
- They are just good friends.
- Friends?

1034
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:12,460
Right.

1035
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,300
That's where it all begins.

1036
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,880
Okay, tell me.

1037
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:23,750
Do you believe that all your
friends are still bachelors?

1038
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,050
You moved to Boston and you moved on.

1039
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,000
She's been here all
these years, alone.

1040
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,630
And she wouldn't. Come on.

1041
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:45,130
It's her life,
she can do what she wants.

1042
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,340
Yes, but she can't.

1043
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,170
Because you won't set her free.

1044
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:58,710
For the last three
days I've been saying...

1045
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,750
...come on Raghav, get the divorce.

1046
01:23:03,170 --> 01:23:04,460
What are we doing here?

1047
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,050
Why are we here?

1048
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,250
Tell me, why are we here?

1049
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:17,550
You forgot again, didn't you?

1050
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,710
You don't forget to
fight with me every day.

1051
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:40,420
Then how do you forget this?

1052
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,130
I am telling you, Raghav.

1053
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,590
If this doesn't happen today...

1054
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,300
...it's never going to happen.

1055
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:09,170
- Amit.
- Raghav.

1056
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:13,130
- Morning.
- Morning.

1057
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:17,170
- How are you?
- I am fine, how about you.

1058
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:21,920
All good...I was going to meet Kuhu.

1059
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,670
Do you know where Kuhu is?

1060
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,420
Raghav, Kuhu isn't some
herb which is found in shops.

1061
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,710
Call her up and ask her.

1062
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:35,340
That's the problem,
I don't have her number.

1063
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:40,250
I thought maybe you know where she is.
I thought I'll ask.

1064
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:47,630
- Why?
- Because you and...

1065
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:52,000
I mean you guys are
so... You guys are friends.

1066
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:52,880
So?

1067
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:57,380
And you're taking these books for her,
so I thought...

1068
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,210
Actually Raghav, Kuhu is at my home.

1069
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:02,840
Packing lunch for my children.

1070
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,130
What the hell do you want with her?

1071
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:12,710
- Are you two have an affair?
- So what?

1072
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:20,210
- Tell me first?
- So what if we do.

1073
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:27,500
- Nothing, it won't matter to me.
- You're such a dog, Raghav.

1074
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:34,920
You don't Kuhu, and you don't
want to see her with someone else.

1075
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:37,670
You know what your problem is, Raghav.

1076
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,170
You won't give Kuhu
the happiness she deserves...

1077
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:45,380
...but, you can't endure
someone else making her happy.

1078
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:48,500
- Do you two have a thing?
- I wish we did, Raghav.

1079
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,550
I wish we did.

1080
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:56,880
Kuhu is the kind of girl
anyone would fall in love with.

1081
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,050
I mean...she's stupid.

1082
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:10,800
But that fool...unfortunately loves
the most pathetic guy in the world.

1083
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:15,840
Happy? Did you get your cheap thrill?

1084
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:23,630
Now go and divorce her.
And please stop confusing everyone.

1085
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,050
Hi, hi...do me a favor.

1086
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,210
Can you ask Kuhu, ma'am
to come here, please.

1087
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,300
Yes...

1088
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:17,380
Now stand up everyone.

1089
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,590
Everyone's going to clap for him.

1090
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:20,210
- Sister Kuhu...
- Yeah.

1091
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:24,880
Mr. Dalmiya's here. - Uncle?
But he was supposed to come tomorrow.

1092
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,210
Ask him to wait for some time,
I'm coming.

1093
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,590
Okay, go.

1094
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,880
- Bala. Bala.
- Yes, madam.

1095
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:36,750
A strong cup of tea for uncle,
and...it's breakfast time.

1096
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,050
Get some breakfast for
him from upstairs.

1097
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:40,500
Yes, madam. - Don't forget the onions.

1098
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,170
So Mr. Dalmiya is
still your favorite, huh?

1099
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:54,090
Dalmiya sir has always
been my favorite.

1100
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,090
And look at you...

1101
01:28:57,210 --> 01:29:00,340
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.
You've got a short-temper.

1102
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:05,170
And you...still Asrani (Comedian).
Smiling on everything.

1103
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:13,710
- Well, bye.
- See you.

1104
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,050
Okay, see you.

1105
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:25,250
- Hello.
- What?

1106
01:29:26,090 --> 01:29:27,460
Are you going to wait here?

1107
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:33,130
Actually, my car's got a flat tire.

1108
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,710
Then why don't you
worry some more, son.

1109
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,380
Your tire will get fixed on its own.

1110
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,380
After all, mechanics are
only good for knitting sweaters.

1111
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,340
What the hell do they know about cars?

1112
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:48,750
You know what,
let's sit together puff our nose.

1113
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,210
That will fix everything, right?

1114
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:01,170
By the way, what did you want from me?

1115
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:08,670
What happened? Why is your face pale?

1116
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:10,840
Please look ahead while driving.

1117
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,800
I only ran over a couple of guys,
not much.

1118
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,090
I am a safe driver.

1119
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:22,920
Poor Amit...went broke
trying to bribe the injured's families.

1120
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:27,920
Amit takes really good care of you,
doesn't he?

1121
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,500
Why? Shouldn't he?

1122
01:30:36,210 --> 01:30:38,210
Tell me. Does it matter?

1123
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,880
Please look ahead.

1124
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,210
Are you mad?

1125
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:58,420
There was a boulder up ahead, please.

1126
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,840
I didn't do it intentionally.

1127
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:04,420
Stop. stop...stop.

1128
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:10,340
Pinky Talkies is still here. - Yes.

1129
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:14,170
They are coming to include it in the
list of seven wonders of the world.

1130
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,590
Which film are they playing now?

1131
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,250
Madam, it's an amazing room.

1132
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:24,710
Room, with balcony,
and a view of the garden, overlooking the sea...

1133
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,840
...and cool breeze 24 hours a day.

1134
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,880
How did you like the room, madam?

1135
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:30,630
It's nice.

1136
01:31:30,710 --> 01:31:33,460
I can write ghost stories here.

1137
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,460
What happened? What happened?

1138
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,130
Co...Co... - What happened?

1139
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,420
Cockroach. Cockroach.

1140
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,090
Help.

1141
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:48,250
What will it take to shut you up? - This
ordinaryIndian is good enough for you.

1142
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:53,420
Do you have a diploma in cinema?
- No, BA.

1143
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:59,210
It's so funny,
I mean...it's been 8 years, but...

1144
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,380
...I still remember
all the scenes clearly.

1145
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:05,710
Things we know closely...

1146
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,460
...we don't have to
try hard to remember them.

1147
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:18,050
So tell me...when did you meet Radhika?

1148
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,460
Three years ago.

1149
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,670
And...when did you two fall in love?

1150
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,170
I don't know,
I...don't calculate these things.

1151
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:53,880
Who proposed?

1152
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,050
I did.

1153
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:11,170
She is gorgeous.

1154
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,130
That's not why I love her.

1155
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,340
Radhika is smart.

1156
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:31,170
Sometimes its fun to be foolish.

1157
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:37,090
Kuhu, you...you're no longer a kid.

1158
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:39,630
You're a grownup.
- And you...

1159
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:44,800
You were born old. When was
the last time you laughed, Raghav?

1160
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,710
Radhika makes me laugh a lot, Kuhu.
She does. - Really?

1161
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,300
Yeah?
- Is she a clown?

1162
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:51,090
Relax.

1163
01:33:58,050 --> 01:34:01,590
I love Radhika a lot, and so does she.

1164
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:14,340
We...cannot stay apart
even for a minute.

1165
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:20,590
And do you guys have
a moment in all those minutes?

1166
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:25,130
Remember...

1167
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,880
Because if you can't remember it,
it's not a moment.

1168
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:42,750
Surprise! Where have you been?

1169
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,880
Radhika, I...

1170
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,340
Where are you going?

1171
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:30,670
Radhika, where are you going?
- It doesn't matter anymore, Raghav.

1172
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:32,710
I am just leaving.

1173
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:37,500
Please, let me explain it to you.

1174
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:38,880
Please, Raghav.

1175
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:42,130
You never stopped loving Kuhu.

1176
01:35:45,550 --> 01:35:51,000
You're everything with
her...which you're not with me.

1177
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:57,340
Back in Boston, I would often wonder...

1178
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:01,550
...why isn't this guy happy?

1179
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,130
Now I got it?

1180
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:11,920
Your heart was still here,
in Mussoorie.

1181
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:14,460
Right?

1182
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:21,500
Radhika,
you're getting all of this wrong.

1183
01:36:22,130 --> 01:36:24,420
Give me a chance to
explain to you... - Raghav.

1184
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,380
Raghav, listen to me.

1185
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:34,590
Kuhu cannot love anyone else,
nor can you.

1186
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:43,380
So please...stop lying to the world,
and yourself.

1187
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:45,380
Just listen to me.

1188
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,250
Radhika.

1189
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,090
Radhika, Kuhu is my past.

1190
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:03,880
I am with you.
- No, Raghav. That's the problem.

1191
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:09,590
You're not with me.
You're still with Kuhu.

1192
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:12,090
I am leaving.

1193
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:18,800
Raghav, you never
introduced me to your papa.

1194
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:27,500
But, when you mee...please tell him,
that I was a nice girl too.

1195
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:52,460
She left...shall we party?

1196
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,380
You ruined my life again.
- What did I do?

1197
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,500
What did you do?

1198
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,630
You corrupted my mind.

1199
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:12,710
Radhika's too. Mine too.

1200
01:38:14,590 --> 01:38:18,000
I came to Mussoorie to get you to
sign the divorce papers, that's all.

1201
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:23,500
Can you do anything
other than fooling people?

1202
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:24,500
Huh?

1203
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,380
And can you do anything
other than blaming other people.

1204
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:31,300
Am I holding you hostage?

1205
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:35,710
Am I coercing you
to spend time with me?

1206
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:39,000
You did what you wanted, Raghav.

1207
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,420
Today and seven years ago.
- That's because you cheated me.

1208
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:48,170
Today...and seven years ago.

1209
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:58,840
What happened? Are you pregnant again?

1210
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,590
I got my period.
- What?

1211
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:06,250
I just got my period.
- Must be a miscarriage.

1212
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,920
Let's go quickly.
- No, Luvlu, you don't get it.

1213
01:39:09,050 --> 01:39:12,250
I wasn't pregnant at all. I panicked.

1214
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,340
My dates were delayed
by two weeks, okay...

1215
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:18,590
...my cycle's always like clockwork.

1216
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:21,000
I got scared, and... - Got married.

1217
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:24,250
Kuhu, I told you, didn't I?
- But what else could I do?

1218
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:27,000
Raghav got so emotional.
You were right there.

1219
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:28,500
It was all over within 30 minutes.

1220
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:30,460
I couldn't understand...
- You couldn't understand.

1221
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,880
Raghav.

1222
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:42,550
You're not pregnant.
- No.

1223
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:45,670
I gave up my scholarship.

1224
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:50,460
I am sorry, Raghav.
I thought I was pregnant.

1225
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:52,130
It was a mistake... - Mistake.

1226
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:57,460
I married you, Kuhu. You're my wife.

1227
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:02,920
You know they don't give
scholarships to married people.

1228
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,750
And you're saying...

1229
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:10,590
Raghav, I panicked. - You panicked,
and look at what it did to my life.

1230
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:14,210
Don't say that, Raghav?
- What else should I say and how?

1231
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:19,460
Now thanks to you I'll
have to stay here, in Mussoorie.

1232
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,130
With Mr. Dalmiya.

1233
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:27,250
The one thing I didn't want to do, Kuhu.
The one thing I didn't want to do.

1234
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:31,420
Raghav, we'll do something.
We'll find a solution.

1235
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:34,460
No one knows and we won't tell anyone.

1236
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,250
Only we know and Luvlu.

1237
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,840
And you won't tell anyone.
- I won't

1238
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:38,500
Right?
- Yes.

1239
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:39,550
Raghav, you can...

1240
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:43,210
He was completely mad. Imagine...

1241
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:47,050
Mr. Dalmiya.
- Mr. Dalmiya, are you free for lunch.

1242
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:47,920
Because we are.

1243
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:50,050
Can we talk tomorrow,
I am busy right now.

1244
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,090
Wait.

1245
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:55,000
And, you have to take
us to the Clubhouse.

1246
01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:57,880
Because we won't settle
for anything less.

1247
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:01,550
Treat?
- Your treat, bro.

1248
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:04,840
If it wasn't for us,
you wouldn't be with Kuhu.

1249
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:09,710
I didn't get it.
What do you mean? - You don't know.

1250
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:13,920
We planned everything so
that you fall in love with Kuhu.

1251
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:17,250
Your match wasn't
made in Heaven, we did.

1252
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:59,420
You didn't wait for a second.

1253
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:04,670
You didn't wait for
a second to listen to me.

1254
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:09,170
You didn't give me an
opportunity to tell you, that...

1255
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:14,000
...yes, I had to plan extensively
to make you fall in love with me.

1256
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:17,960
But my love wasn't planned.

1257
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:21,710
If that was true,
then I would've been somewhere else.

1258
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,170
With someone else.

1259
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,300
And not waiting here
for you like a fool.

1260
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:28,000
Did I tell you to do so?

1261
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:31,500
Did I force you to stay here?

1262
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:36,880
I told you,
Kuhu, I don't like lies that's all.

1263
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,880
You know what, you're a goddamn liar.

1264
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:46,550
And do you know what you are?
You're a coward.

1265
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,130
Back then you were only
thinking about your scholarship.

1266
01:42:50,210 --> 01:42:52,130
You were only worried about yourself,

1267
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:54,420
Did you think about me?

1268
01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:01,210
How will I face my parents?
Where will I go with my married life?

1269
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,210
You left...and you found someone else.

1270
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,500
I stayed back...and lived as your wife.

1271
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:16,340
I didn't know whether
you'll come back or not.

1272
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:18,630
Whether you still remember me or not.

1273
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:24,050
Whether you're alive or not.
But I still belonged to you.

1274
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:28,750
You want a divorce, don't you?

1275
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:24,340
"The mile-wide rifts..."

1276
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:27,960
"...how can anyone breathe?"

1277
01:44:28,090 --> 01:44:31,250
"The mile-wide rifts..."

1278
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:34,130
"...how can anyone breathe?"

1279
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:39,800
"Everyone's here, except for you."

1280
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:44,750
"My body's here, but not my heart."

1281
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:50,420
"Everyone's here, except for you."

1282
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,800
"My body's here, but not my heart."

1283
01:44:53,880 --> 01:45:01,840
"Tell me...how can one feel he's alive?"

1284
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:34,130
"Your beautiful face
still, dwells in my eyes..."

1285
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:37,250
"...come back to me, beloved."

1286
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:40,750
"Without you, life has stopped..."

1287
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,380
"...O my beloved."

1288
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,500
"...beloved."

1289
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:49,840
"...beloved."

1290
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:54,050
"...beloved."

1291
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:50,000
"There's silence everywhere I go."

1292
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:56,590
"Who do I narrate my heart to?"

1293
01:46:58,090 --> 01:47:02,920
"How can the swords of your memories..."

1294
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:09,750
"...my heart endure anymore?"

1295
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,000
"Swallow my sorrows..."

1296
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:13,710
"...and live again."

1297
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:15,460
"Swallow my sorrows..."

1298
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,130
"...and live again."

1299
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:20,000
"Because you're in my sights now."

1300
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:47,750
Come in.

1301
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:16,210
You're a grownup now.
You deserve a drink with your papa.

1302
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:29,550
Cheers.

1303
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,130
Aren't you going to ask anything?

1304
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:52,210
You don't question those you love.

1305
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:57,420
They just talk.

1306
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:07,090
You said that so easily.

1307
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:11,420
Such sweet words, like honey.

1308
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:18,210
Anyone who hears
would think I am the villain.

1309
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:25,050
I know you're angry with me...

1310
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:27,090
...for the story only you heard.

1311
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,460
Who was wrong,
or who was right yesterday...

1312
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:37,630
...shouldn't matter today.
- Doesn't matter.

1313
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,380
Doesn't matter, Mr. Dalmiya.

1314
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:47,250
You left my mother. You kept
me away from her all those years...

1315
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,050
...and you say it doesn't matter.

1316
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,250
And after everything that happened...

1317
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:56,300
...you want me to forget everything.

1318
01:49:56,710 --> 01:50:00,420
Forget it.
- I didn't say you should forget.

1319
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:05,170
All I am saying is that,
you're a grownup now...

1320
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:11,300
...so you don't make the
same mistakes which I did.

1321
01:50:12,090 --> 01:50:14,420
Think about your present,
that is the reason I want you...

1322
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,500
Oh come on, Mr. Dalmiya.

1323
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:18,670
Even after 7 years we're
doing the same old thing.

1324
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:21,960
We're doing the same old thing,
once again.

1325
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:23,550
We're still fighting.

1326
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:29,250
And do you know why?
Because you can't clarify things.

1327
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:33,630
You always twist your words.
There is no clarity.

1328
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,170
There's lots of clarity.
- There are lots of complications.

1329
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:39,340
I am not complicating anything.

1330
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:48,460
I am sorry.

1331
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:57,460
It's not as simple...as black and white.

1332
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:04,300
Life is too short, Raghav.

1333
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:11,670
What's done is done. Move ahead.

1334
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,250
I don't want you to make
the same mistakes that we did.

1335
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,880
Kuhu loves you a lot.

1336
01:51:24,630 --> 01:51:30,050
All her foolishness...was for you.

1337
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:34,630
Forgive her.

1338
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,590
You knew about Kuhu.

1339
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:53,800
I have only one son.
I know everything about him.

1340
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:03,710
For seven years,
that girl's been loving you...

1341
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:09,420
...without any complaints
or grievance. Accept her.

1342
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:15,590
Bring her home. Go.

1343
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,550
You can come back and fight with me.

1344
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:36,340
I love you, dad.
- I love you too.

1345
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:37,920
I always have.

1346
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:43,880
I love you.

1347
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:55,050
Just say it.

1348
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,800
Talk to me.

1349
01:54:00,050 --> 01:54:01,920
Or else, for the rest of the life...

1350
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:08,590
"The moment I see you...

1351
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:18,130
...is worth cherishing for me."

1352
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:34,960
"The moment I see you...is
worth cherishing for me."

1353
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:40,050
"When you're not around,
there's a darkness surrounding me."

1354
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:45,210
"You light up my mornings."

1355
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:50,000
"You're the one who
dwells in my heart."

1356
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:54,750
"You are in my sights."

1357
01:54:58,130 --> 01:55:01,630
Hey, what were you doing?
- Sh** do you want some?

1358
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:05,590
Yuck, you're so dirty.

1359
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:08,210
I was going to say
something emotional, but...

1360
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,670
Emotional? Speak up.

1361
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:15,460
I am feeling sad without Raghav.

1362
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:19,250
I think...I think I
am kind of missing him.

1363
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:22,550
Yes, because you're
pregnant with his child.

1364
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:25,840
You're his friend,
not his girlfriend who parted ways.

1365
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:27,590
Let them chill.

1366
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:31,000
- They haven't finished their honeymoon yet.
- Stop it...stop it...stop lecturing me.

1367
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:32,590
Who wrote on Facebook,...

1368
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:35,590
...when some people leave you,
they leave you with a heavy heart.

1369
01:55:35,670 --> 01:55:39,000
But when some people leave you,
they leave you with no heart at all.

1370
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:40,710
Bloody dog, stalking me on FB.

1371
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,550
I am not stalking you,
just watching your pictures.

1372
01:55:43,630 --> 01:55:46,800
By the way,
you do look a little hot these days.

1373
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:49,500
Just over the past few months,
don't get carried away.

1374
01:55:49,590 --> 01:55:51,710
By the way, you still look the same.

1375
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:52,630
I see...

1376
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:53,590
Mussoorie's cheapster.

1377
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:55,170
I see, Mussoorie's cheapster.

1378
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:59,210
Then tell me something,
why are your cheeks turning pink?

1379
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,840
I've heard there's been
an outbreak of an epidemic...

1380
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,880
...called the Ishqeria virus.
Just be careful.

1381
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,710
Get lost, it's not like that.

1382
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:08,460
And anyway,
when I come to Mussoorie next week...

1383
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:10,500
...I won't go out with you.

1384
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:12,500
Hold on...what did you say?

1385
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:14,590
Are you coming to Mussoorie?

1386
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,170
Are you coming to Mussoorie? - Yes.

1387
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:20,550
Why didn't you tell me before?
- I am telling you now.

1388
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:25,500
I see...you're telling me now so that...

1389
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:30,130
...I can make all arrangements before
you arrive. - It's not like that.

1390
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:33,500
Have you seen your face?
- It's better than yours.

1391
01:56:33,590 --> 01:56:34,750
You...

1392
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,380
First, go and take some
lessons on how to hit on a girl.

1393
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:40,170
hello...I am a born stud.
I even hit on my nurse.

1394
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:42,920
Isn't that our college
shirt that you're wearing?

1395
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:46,420
This one? You remember?
