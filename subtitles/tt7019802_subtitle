1
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,000
'The wick'

2
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
From this year onwards, our
college has announced...

3
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,680
to give away the best
student of the year award.

4
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
The first ever winner
of this award..

5
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,320
is Jeeva and the college is honored
to award him this recognition.

6
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,280
We kindly request Jeeva
to come to the dias.

7
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,240
And now the district head will
honor Jeeva with the award.

8
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,880
- Congrats Jeeva.
- Thank you sir.

9
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,360
We kindly request Jeeva
to give a speech.

10
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,960
This award...

11
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Listen!

12
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
You have just been given
an prestigious award.

13
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,880
Don't you have the manners to greet
the chief guests on the dias?

14
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
Look at you right away talk about
the award saying "This award.."

15
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,800
To the chief guests present on the dias;

16
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,360
the IAS officer and to
our college principal...

17
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,920
I extended my hearty greetings.

18
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,880
This award...

19
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,520
Again now!

20
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,480
Did you win it by yourself?

21
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,080
Won't you thank your supporters?

22
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,240
I won this award...

23
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,560
because of the support lend
by my professors,

24
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,360
staffs and friends.

25
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,480
I convey my thanks to all of them.

26
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
This award...

27
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,680
Look at your attitude!

28
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,240
You have been granted
a prestigious award.

29
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,920
Your attitude must
inspire everyone there!

30
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,000
This award... is nothing
but a regret to me.

31
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,600
I don't want this award.

32
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,760
I return it back.

33
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,440
What did you buy and why
are you returning it?

34
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,680
Didn't you say you have
an interview at 9?

35
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,800
The time is 10 now.

36
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
10 o clock?

37
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,760
When you know that I
had to leave at 9...

38
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,160
why are you waking me up late?

39
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,520
I've been trying to wake you up since
8 o clock. You just won't wake up!

40
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,520
Come on mom!

41
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
Dad troubles me in my dreams.

42
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,800
You trouble me in reality.

43
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,280
So, guess I'll have to forget
about achieving in life.

44
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
You never had a good sleep
during your studying days.

45
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,800
But now after completing
college, sleeping is all you do.

46
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,800
I am helpless.

47
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,600
- So, isn't dad here?
- Why?

48
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,280
Well, the signs around
the house indicates so.

49
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,920
Look here, he just finished
a round of advice and left.

50
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,360
Don't you start the next round.

51
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,440
Where did go so early?

52
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,240
Special session for 10th grade students.
He went to take the class.

53
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,680
Even you can't bear him after
being with him so long;

54
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,720
I pity the plight of those
45 10th grade students.

55
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Isn't he suppose to teach Math?
But doesn't look so.

56
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,960
Yeah like you are going to understand
everything at the first go!

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840
Wait and watch.

58
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,080
Discipline.

59
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,120
See the first letter D?

60
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
What is the corresponding number to it?

61
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,320
Someone write it down.

62
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,800
Now you.

63
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,160
Whose next?

64
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,440
I hope all of you know this Thirukural
( Proverbs by Thiruvalluvar)

65
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,520
This is the most respected
word in all languages.

66
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,840
If you withhold it with dedication,
you can come up in your life.

67
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,440
If you add the corresponding numbers
to the letters it sums up to 100.

68
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,760
Similarly, if you follow it with dedication
then you will have a great life.

69
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,320
All you got to do is...

70
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,000
Attend all your classes without fail
and be punctual to school.

71
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
You must be attentive
in the class.

72
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,600
Do this and you will succeed.

73
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, to catch a train we
go to the railway station.

74
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,560
Do we reach late? No.

75
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,040
Because if we take our own time
then we'll miss the train.

76
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,400
If we show that discipline
in all our activities....

77
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,040
we can definitely
succeed in life.

78
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,280
He has been repeating
the same for years now!

79
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,920
With that, lets start the class.

80
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,840
- Munnusamy.
- Sir?

81
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,840
- Someone is here looking for you.
- Go back to your place.

82
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,520
Ok sir.

83
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,200
All of you note this down.

84
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Come on now.

85
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
Don't you know me very well?

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
- Don't you have sense?
- Sorry sir.

87
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,120
Already the students
are not so attentive.

88
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,440
Over that you come
and distract them.

89
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,760
The how will they concentrate?

90
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
The person said he
knows you very well.

91
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,000
Let it be.

92
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,560
How many hours do we spend here?

93
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,920
- Only 7 hours right?
- Yes sir.

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,760
- Rest of the time we are at home. Right?
- Yes sir.

95
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,320
Even if it's so urgent, you must ask
them to wait until the class is over.

96
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,200
- Only then they will understand.
- Sorry sir.

97
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,920
- It's the break time now. Isn't it?
- Yes sir.

98
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,280
- Who is it?
- There he is.

99
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,720
What's up?

100
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,920
You stay opposite to my house and
yet you are here to meet me?

101
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,800
Did you feel the school
was even closer?

102
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,000
Come on.
I am already upset.

103
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,280
Upset?

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
What's your problem?

105
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,120
Remember I bought a piece of land?

106
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,120
Yes.

107
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,920
You did tell me you bought a land
somewhere. What's the issue?

108
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm being demanded to sell it.

109
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,320
Did you advertise to sell it?

110
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,080
No.

111
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,920
Then what's the issue?

112
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,480
Everyone who bought land in that
locality sold it to the same person.

113
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,320
If its a good price then
why don't you sell it off?

114
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,200
I would've even if they offered
me the price I bought it for.

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,600
They offer half of that.

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,960
Then refuse.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
The person who is demanding
is not an ordinary person.

118
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,760
Oh come on.
The land belongs to you.

119
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
How does it matter who he is?

120
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,080
It's your property
and your money.

121
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
So...who is this person?

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,440
Angannan!

123
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,680
Who's that?

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,680
Haven't you heard of Angannan?

125
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,600
You don't believe in god.

126
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,680
Then why have you built a
ritual room in the house?

127
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,320
I know everyone around fears me.

128
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,560
But I don't know if god fears me.

129
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,760
Hence I've locked it.

130
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,840
So now, even if god wants to meet
me, I will have to approve of it.

131
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,920
Do you now doubt
that I am the god?

132
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Come on! You are indeed my ruler, my god.
Why do you doubt me?

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,760
See that's the sign.

134
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,360
Hello?

135
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,760
Chief, it's me.

136
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,720
I know that.
Tell me.

137
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,160
Unexpectedly my wife fell sick.

138
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,680
I admitted her in the hospital and had to
use the money I had to pay the bills there.

139
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,040
I am trying my best to arrange
the money that I owe you.

140
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,200
- Chief...
- Please don't harm me.

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,240
Everyone's waiting for you. They
have been calling repeatedly.

142
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,400
Are they here yet?

143
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,880
Chief, they came long back.

144
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,840
Attend that call and keep
acknowledging whatever he says.

145
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,920
Ok chief.

146
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,480
I thought of selling my land but...

147
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
In the 150 acres land deal...

148
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,760
only person is opposing.
He is not ready to sell his land.

149
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,480
In you get involved we
can seal the deal easily.

150
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
We can share the profit in half.

151
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,560
Well chief, I mean, you take it
and give us whatever you wish.

152
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,120
I am on my way to the party office.

153
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,040
It's election time. Let's
first prepare for election.

154
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,040
I know how to deal this one.
You guys leave.

155
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,280
Ok chief.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,880
I promise to repay
your money somehow.

157
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,000
Please have mercy on me.

158
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,720
Come to House# 5
at Gandhi Nagar.

159
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,960
Why there?

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,160
Isn't that your house?

161
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,680
Won't you attend
your dad's funeral?

162
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,600
- Chief please!
- I want that money in 1 hour's time.

163
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Chief please.

164
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,360
This ain't a truck! Its a car!
Not everybody can get inside.

165
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,240
Let's reach there late.

166
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,720
Indeed.
That's the way it should be.

167
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,440
- Greetings chief.
- Welcome sir.

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,400
When did you reach?

169
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
Even before joining the duty and
taking charge, I am here to meet you.

170
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,000
- Looks like you are going out.
- Yes.

171
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,920
Do you want me to join?

172
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,280
I am going to request for a post.
So I don't need security so soon.

173
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,600
You have just joined. Go to
the police station first.

174
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,600
- Ok.
- Ok.

175
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,520
- See you.
- Right.

176
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,680
Excuse me inspector.

177
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,240
We know when and how to summon you.
Just obey us then.

178
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,760
You may leave now.
Leave!

179
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,280
Look who it is.
What are you doing here?

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,240
What's up Bhoomi? What are you doing
here like a dedicated student?

181
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,720
I shouldn't have
trusted you guys.

182
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,920
I could've wooed at least 4 girls if I had
tried on my own. Untrustworthy fellows!

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,440
I became friends with you so
that I can woo an educated girl.

184
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Instead of spending on you guys, if I
had started a foundation in my name...

185
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,560
I would've become the
epitome of education by now.

186
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,280
Not epitome of education...
but epitome of sex education.

187
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,880
Today isn't last day of your college
alone; even our friendship!

188
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,960
A boy must either have
friends or a girl friend.

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,560
If you don't have both
then you'll go mad.

190
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,840
I won't go mad.

191
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,200
I'll befriend the 1st year guys
and woo a girl from their class!

192
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,160
Buddy! That won't work out here.
Why don't you try another college?

193
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,120
Correct buddy!

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
I'm late for interview.
I'll start now.

195
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,520
Bhoomi, hop on.

196
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,880
I'll introduce to a Mr. Hitch.

197
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,960
Hop on! Hop on!

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,360
Please do this for all the
liquor I sponsored you guys.

199
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,480
Watch out!

200
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
"You %^@$%!!!!"

201
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,720
Don't you have sense?

202
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,520
I'm sorry boss.

203
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,760
No man likes getting insulted
in front of a woman.

204
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,280
Especially in front of your wife.

205
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,080
You shouldn't have
used that word!

206
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
Sorry boss.

208
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
Only if we win this by election...

209
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,640
then for the next 3 years we can run
the government without any hassle.

210
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,880
Remember that first.

211
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,680
Chief, what's the link between
us and the MP election?

212
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,600
There you go!

213
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,560
This is what happens when an uneducated
fellow turns into a minister.

214
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,280
If we loose our respect in the central
then next will CBI raid at our houses.

215
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,640
Why are you worried chief?

216
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,920
We are the ruling party.
Why should we be afraid?

217
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,560
There is no history of any ruling
party losing in the by-elections.

218
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,000
And that is why I am afraid.

219
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
If we lose then we'll
have to face the media.

220
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,600
What a time for him to die!?

221
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,360
So who is the big shot there now?

222
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,440
Finally, the spotlight is on you.

223
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
Chief...

224
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,480
He has been working in
our party for 20 years.

225
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Greetings.

226
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,120
Look at him sitting in a corner.

227
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,800
Give me my spectacles.
Let me have a look at him.

228
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,040
20 years?

229
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,600
I've never seen him.

230
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,920
Chief, in the region where
election will take place,

231
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,120
we had made him the dummy candidate
there for the past 20 years.

232
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,640
Apart from that, he has a good
reputation in that region.

233
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
If we prepare for the
elections as planned...

234
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,080
he will surely win this time.

235
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,240
How much can you invest?

236
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,800
Even to come here, the party office, I
had to request my wife to lend me money.

237
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,800
I don't have anything chief.

238
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,920
Oh! Oh!

239
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,560
Is he a pauper?

240
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,960
Chief, if you need a rich person then
we must look out for someone else.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,360
What matters?
Victory or money?

242
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,840
Well, money isn't an issue.

243
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,720
So let's announce him as the candidate.

244
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,520
Fine...

245
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,600
after a long time an innocent and
pauper is becoming a candidate.

246
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,360
Victory is what matters
to us right now.

247
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
So, shall we announce
him as the candidate?

248
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
- Sure chief.
- Yes chief.

249
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,440
In upcoming by elections, the
candidate representing us...

250
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
Greetings chief.

251
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
Welcome Angu.

252
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,720
Look at that chief, non of them
are showing you any respect.

253
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,640
Forget it.

254
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,720
Let them be seated.

255
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,240
It's the first time they are tasting
success of being in a post.

256
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,920
Can't you see him coming. Move!

257
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Move you district head!
Move! Move!

258
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,240
Have a seat chief.

259
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Did you get the money?

260
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,840
Yes. I did.

261
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,240
So, are you back here to join
as a member in the party?

262
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
Chief, I am here
requesting for a post.

263
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,560
Spotlight was on you...

264
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,640
He snatched it away.

265
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,480
It won't be on you anymore.

266
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,400
We formed the government after
throwing you out of the party.

267
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,880
People votes us because we threw
out a corrupted politician.

268
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,600
What will the people think if we
take you back in. Forget the people,

269
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,520
the media will finish
us with questions!

270
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,880
Come on now! Show me one face who isn't
corrupt and have never been caught.

271
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,840
If you bow down in shame, it
doesn't make the truth false.

272
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,960
You bid good bye to
politics at your own will.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,920
Yes I did. Now I am old.

274
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,080
Why should I keep obeying
and saluting others?

275
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,080
Look, he is the minster
of home affairs.

276
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,200
I've been asking him to
transfer a police...

277
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,840
but he doesn't give
me an appointment.

278
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,360
Can he even spell Police?

279
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,240
Earlier he was nothing but
today looks like he is busy!

280
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,720
Why are you pulling all that?
Forget it.

281
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,360
Listen, we shall do something for you in the
next MLA election. This is MP election.

282
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,960
All I am asking is a seat.

283
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,520
I don't need any other answer.

284
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,280
Will you give me a seat or not?
I need a seat!

285
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,400
I'll win and prove it to you.

286
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,320
What if you lose?

287
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
Were you the IAS office earlier?

288
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,000
Nope. Just an office boy
at IAS office right?

289
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
I'll have a statue in the beach
only if I die when I and the CM.

290
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,120
That's why I am fighting
to stay as the CM.

291
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,680
Don't you worry chief.

292
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,880
After you die, with all
the respects paid...

293
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,200
we will bury you and erect a
statue for you. That's our duty.

294
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,680
I confirm it. It'll
be in Marina beach.

295
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,840
That's all I need.

296
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,640
What do you all say? Lets
announce him as the candidate?

297
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,640
- Ok chief.
- Ok chief.

298
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,440
Mr. Angannan has been nominated
as the party's candidate.

299
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,040
Thank you chief.
Give me the loin cloth.

300
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,040
Which one chief? Oh! Oh!
It just fell off.

301
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,720
What's with the uniform
of the opponent party?

302
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,400
If you hadn't nominated me,
I would have gone there.

303
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,120
Fine. Get started with
the preparations.

304
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,760
You! Accompany him and do the
necessary helps he requires.

305
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,640
Ok chief.

306
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,240
- Long live chief!
- Long live chief!

307
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,920
Move! Make way!

308
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,120
I said make way!

309
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,360
- Long live chief!
- Long live chief Angannan!

310
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,520
Buddy!

311
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,840
He is my dad's friend.

312
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,040
So what?

313
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,080
He will tell on me to my dad.
Let's leave.

314
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,360
It's not like he is at temple.

315
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
He too is in the bar.

316
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,360
Dear.

317
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,360
Come here.

318
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes uncle.

319
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,840
Any bar you go,
you'll find some known face.

320
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
- Just come.
- Hello uncle.

321
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,560
Are you here in
the bar to booze?

322
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,240
No uncle.

323
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
It's my friend's birthday.
I am here to cut cake.

324
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
- Carry on.
- Thank you.

325
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,280
Just popped out of the bud and
look he is already drinking.

326
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,160
- See what you did!?
- Buddy! Let's get sloshed today.

327
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,640
Okay, order now.

328
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,960
Cheers!

329
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,800
Why did you destroy
the plastic cup?

330
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,520
Else, how will I know I
drank the 1st round?

331
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,600
Our basic salary for the work we got
out of our qualification is 5000 bucks.

332
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,440
What is 5000 good for?

333
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,840
It is used up for
transportation and provision!

334
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,600
And you know what my
dad keeps saying?

335
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,280
He keeps showing off how much he spent
on my education! It's torturing!

336
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,720
Mechanical engineering.

337
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,480
Where did we final land
a job with this degree?

338
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,360
We are going to rot in a
the hot lathe companies.

339
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,240
Drink buddy.

340
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,680
You have a gold of heart buddy.

341
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,480
What do you know about
our field of study?

342
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,360
You don't realize it's importance.

343
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,480
Enlighten me please.

344
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,960
Now, we are sitting here.

345
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,440
Even this very place is nothing
without our contribution.

346
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,080
What are you blabbering?

347
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
All that you are drinking
is my contribution

348
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Where's yours?

349
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,080
Look at the liquor
bottle's cap...

350
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,000
mechanics like us did it.

351
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,760
Is it?

352
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,440
Similarly this opener.
Impossible without us.

353
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,360
We made it.

354
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,880
Look at him. High yet sincerely
working on his laptop.

355
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,640
The screws in that laptop?
We made it.

356
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,680
From a small screw to an airplane, nothing
is possible without our contribution.

357
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So buddy...

358
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,280
you boast so much
about our degree.

359
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,440
Then why don't we get
good job with good pay?

360
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,800
But one thing...

361
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,720
because I chose to study
mechanical engineering...

362
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,600
there is one benefit.

363
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,600
All the other department
students were afraid of us.

364
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,680
Aren't we here to forget all this?

365
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,000
Now who started this topic?

366
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,360
Buddy give me a cigarette.

367
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,800
Do you have a matchbox?

368
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,040
No?

369
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,880
Boy!

370
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,840
No! Don't call the boy.

371
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,760
I know another person.
Wait and see.

372
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,480
Good evening uncle.

373
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,560
Greetings uncle.

374
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,840
Uncle, do you have a matchbox?

375
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,040
What is it?

376
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,720
I asked you match box but why
are you massaging yourself?

377
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,920
Well dear...

378
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,200
ask the boy.

379
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,320
Tell me, how long have
you been drinking?

380
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,880
For 12 years now.

381
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,680
Oh 12 years?

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,560
You have been drinking for so long...

383
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
and still don't you know that you
must carry a match box to the bar?

384
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,960
Forget that.

385
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,880
What did you say
after I walked away?

386
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,320
You said something behind me.

387
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,120
What did I say?

388
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,200
Sounded like some moral value.

389
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,560
Something like 'just popped
out of bud and already...."

390
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
You say you have been
drinking for 12 years...

391
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,480
how much have you
popped out of the bud?

392
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,520
If you had popped out really
well it would have been evident.

393
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,440
For example, like a
tail in the back.

394
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,000
- Or in the front, you can say...
- Dude!

395
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,120
- Dude?
- I forgot.

396
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,920
So show me how much have
you popped out of the bud!

397
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,040
I just said it casually
like everyone else does.

398
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
Uncle!

399
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,680
Show me!

400
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,960
Come on dear.

401
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,680
At least have some respect,
I am elder to you.

402
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,080
You talk behind my back! Why
should I have respect for you?

403
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,080
He said so!

404
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,640
That I just popped
out of the bud.

405
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,040
I swear, I won't drink here after.

406
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,360
No! Show me!

407
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,080
Or else I'll break your
head along with his!

408
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,760
What business do you
have with that innocent?

409
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,920
This guy? Innocent?

410
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,600
- Enough! Come on.
- Book a cab for me.

411
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,800
Hey! Remember! You must show me!

412
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,400
Come on

413
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,600
We are here to leave our hardships and
sorrows behind and he quotes proverbs!

414
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,280
That too behind my back!

415
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,760
We are filled with guts and
our heart is full of valor.

416
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,400
So take every step carefully
in this battle of life.

417
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,160
Don't take success to your head nor
let the failure knock you down.

418
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,680
Both, victory and failure are experiences.
So keep progressing.

419
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,440
When a problems arises,
take it as a challenge!

420
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,080
Use your experiences
to knock it down!

421
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,800
Turn your sweat into success.

422
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,680
Be ready to accept pain too.

423
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,240
Remember the pain is a indication
that you are being sculpted to win.

424
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,720
Don't bother about the problems
that lie on your path to success.

425
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:06,080
See it as the steps of failure
that leads to success.

426
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,360
Always help the needy in your path.

427
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,040
This will bring the closer to each other.

428
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,720
Looking at one's negative won't
make this world a better place.

429
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,160
So forgive and forget, that's
what humanity is all about.

430
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,400
Appreciate the good
things you come across.

431
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,240
Appreciate good things
of your rivals too.

432
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,920
Let you valor and honesty change
the place around you for good.

433
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,560
In turn let it change your country and in
turn let it make the world a better place.

434
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,720
Don't bother about the problems
that lie on your path to success.

435
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,440
See it as the steps of failure
that leads to success.

436
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,920
Why are you out at
this hour uncle?

437
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,840
Nothing dear.
Just came out for some fresh air.

438
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,360
- Are you sick?
- No, I'm fine.

439
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,080
- Ok, see you then.
- See you.

440
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,240
How did you do that? You opened
the door before I could knock.

441
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,040
It's 11 O clock.

442
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,760
Tell it to your husband.

443
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,760
He keeps saying that
I am undisciplined.

444
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,480
You open the door and
there I am on time.

445
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,080
Do you think I could
be more disciplined?

446
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,520
Shall I wake him up and tell him?

447
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
What?

448
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,520
- Had your food?
- Yes.

449
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,880
Did that broker
fellow buy you food?

450
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
How many times have I warned
you not to call him that?

451
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,560
Fine.

452
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,680
Did he buy you food?

453
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,040
Yes.

454
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,720
Shouldn't you be sleeping?
Now go.

455
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,200
- Good night.
- Good night.

456
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,800
Sir!

457
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,120
Does your daughter set alarm for
her or for the whole street?

458
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,720
I am just returning.
I'll check and let you know.

459
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,040
Troublesome daughter and
equally troublesome dad!

460
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,120
You look so fresh!

461
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,000
I woke up at 4,
bathed and got ready.

462
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,360
By then it was only 5.

463
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,800
I have to leave at only 6.

464
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,080
Its 6:15 now.

465
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,760
Oh! Oh! My interview!

466
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,120
I'm late!

467
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,680
Didn't even have my coffee.
Dad is so irresponsible!

468
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,480
Where is my bag daddy?

469
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,440
What are you looking for?

470
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,360
Where is my bag?

471
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
Look at there! Its
hanging there.

472
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
- I'm making coffee.
- No thanks.

473
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,880
Have it.

474
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,960
I'll drink at aunty's house.

475
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,320
You are suppose to make coffee for your dad,
instead I make and yet you don't drink.

476
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,320
Bye dad.

477
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,360
The bike tyre is punctured.

478
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,760
Take the rickshaw today.

479
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,080
I'll get it fixed today.

480
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,040
Who allowed him to use my bike?

481
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,840
Doesn't pay heed to me at all!

482
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,520
1st time interview and
I am already late!

483
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,840
Aunty!

484
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,040
Aunty!

485
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,920
Look at her!

486
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,440
She'll scream to the
whole town for a coffee.

487
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,520
Keerthy, make her some coffee.

488
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,560
Aunty.

489
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,520
Where is my coffee?

490
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,640
Hold it right there.

491
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,640
What?

492
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,640
Won't you allow me?

493
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,440
You sounded like you
are in a hurry.

494
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,720
Here. Have this
coffee and leave.

495
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,520
It looks like it has gone cold.
Go heat it.

496
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,960
Look at it.
It's still very hot!

497
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,160
They cool it for me.

498
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,960
Let me go meet your brother.

499
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,520
Do not disturb me please.

500
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,000
Just say what is it.

501
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,720
Hey! Are you awake?

502
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,840
Tell me what is it?

503
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,080
Can you drop me at office?

504
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,800
Why?

505
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,800
My bike has a flat tyre.

506
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,000
Didn't you find a rickshaw?

507
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,360
Don't I know that?

508
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,840
Will you drop me or not?

509
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,320
How many times have I told you?
Don't you have sense?

510
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,480
Haven't I told you?

511
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,400
That except my mom and sister I
won't take any girl in my bike.

512
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,480
Stop showing off! I am asking
because it's an emergency.

513
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,200
It's not like I am asking
you everyday to drop me.

514
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,960
Like that's gonna happen!

515
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,680
Aren't you here for your coffee?

516
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,200
Just have it and leave!

517
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,640
Wait and watch! Someday
you will need my help!

518
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,240
I'll take my revenge then.

519
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
Here is your coffee Swathi.

520
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,280
Why do you wanna pull his leg?
That to at early in the morning.

521
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,960
Comment on your son and you
just can't withstand it.

522
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,480
Watch out.
It's hot!

523
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,160
Have you started?

524
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
Uncle, do you know
what is discipline?

525
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,400
Did you just ask me that?

526
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,680
Waking up early is a
sign of discipline.

527
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,920
I woke up at 6 and
went to buy groceries.

528
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,200
Not you. There is a fellow
still sleeping inside.

529
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,480
Is that your problem?

530
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,440
I'll take care of him.

531
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,600
You may peacefully leave.

532
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,400
Thank you uncle.

533
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
Take care.

534
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,880
Listen!

535
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,320
Is your son still sleeping?

536
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
He left long back.

537
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,000
Why do you lie like this?

538
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,160
She just told me.

539
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,520
He is not here.

540
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,360
He already left?

541
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,800
- I won't pay for a single tea!
- What?!

542
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,640
After all you don't serve us!

543
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,920
Bhoomi you left early last night.

544
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,400
You must have heard his song.

545
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,960
His philosophies
made me sober again.

546
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,160
You must buy me booze today.

547
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
Not so early.

548
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,760
Shall we go for a walk?

549
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,080
He should buy for us

550
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
Hold on!

551
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
Why is he running?
Didn't we say walking?

552
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
Can't you hear?

553
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,320
You senseless!

554
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,560
Help him!

555
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,200
Dude he is drunk.
That too so early.

556
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,160
Already drunk so early
in the morning?

557
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Move!

558
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,640
No!

559
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,600
Please no!

560
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,720
Get up!

561
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,000
No!

562
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
How dare you compete
with our chief?

563
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,560
Cold blooded murder!

564
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,040
Buddy!

565
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,960
Oh! Oh! Wait for me!

566
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,680
Wait for me!

567
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,200
What's with the sprinting?

568
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
Why are you rushing?

569
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,360
You!

570
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,600
If we could've managed to take selfie
there, it would have gone viral.

571
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,920
You just left me!

572
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,600
Didn't you guys go for a jog?

573
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,320
We saw a brutal murder there.

574
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:43,920
What?

575
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,800
In movies, people at least
wait and watch the murder.

576
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,080
These guys didn't even wait.
They just left me!

577
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,440
People kill each other.

578
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,920
Saw the face of the murderer?
He had scars in his face.

579
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,640
Why unnecessarily get involved?

580
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,120
Harish and Danny split in opposite
direction to their houses.

581
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,080
They escaped?

582
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,280
Attention!

583
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,160
Where did you find him?

584
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,760
- What happened to him?
- Retard!

585
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,160
You! Stop it now!

586
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,360
- Jeeva.
- Yes dad?

587
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,280
Have you started?

588
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,600
I'll be there at 10 sharp.

589
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,280
- Good morning sir.
- Good morning.

590
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,000
Where is everybody?

591
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,360
Isn't the interview today?

592
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,840
Isn't everyone here yet?

593
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,720
See that!

594
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,400
I am always punctual.

595
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,560
Others are irresponsible.

596
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,280
You can't say that!

597
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,760
It's been 6 months
since you joined.

598
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,400
Have you ever arrived on time?
Always late!

599
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,840
- Sir...
- What?

600
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,040
Cameraman was here at 6:15.

601
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,640
The guest to be interviewed
was here at 6:30.

602
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,440
You are suppose to do the
interview and you are here at 8!

603
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,360
How will the channel
make name then?

604
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
Sir, we just lost 15 mins here.

605
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,960
Let me conduct the interview.

606
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,720
No need.

607
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,880
Already I've assigned another anchor.
It's about to get over.

608
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,520
- Sir!
- Just a moment!

609
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,960
Here. 500 bucks.

610
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Go hand it over at MD's house.

611
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,160
You want me to go?

612
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,880
That's your punishment.

613
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,520
- I'll be back in a jiffy.
- No!

614
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,920
Come back tomorrow.

615
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,400
But be here on time!

616
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,120
Ok?

617
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,960
Out!

618
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,760
Rammoorthy!

619
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,440
Coming sir.

620
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,320
Why are you looking
at the footwear?

621
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,520
I want to leave my foot wear.

622
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,240
Everyone has left it here.
You too can leave it here.

623
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,680
Isn't there a stand to place it?

624
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,600
It's there.

625
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,040
Wonder where such people come from?

626
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,560
- Sir, what about my issue.
- Please come.

627
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,720
I've already informed.
It should be done today.

628
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,560
Sir, she has been following
up for long now.

629
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,120
Please get it done.

630
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,800
- Thanks sir.
- It's ok. No worries.

631
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,720
Everything will be ready tomorrow.
Come back tomorrow.

632
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,880
Ok sir.

633
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,760
Whoa!

634
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,080
They have placed the foot wear
stand in the wrong place. Genius!

635
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,280
Listen.

636
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,880
Why did you have to do that?

637
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,760
You are right. How long would
it take to arrange them?

638
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,880
5 minutes.

639
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,360
If I too have done the
same like others

640
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,960
Then a person will
come after me,...

641
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,880
...he will give a session
on this for an hour!

642
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,640
Is that ok for you?

643
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,640
Who's that?

644
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,040
I have saved you from him!

645
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,280
From whom?

646
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,640
- Rammoorthy.
- Coming sir.

647
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,640
Jeeva.

648
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
Vardharajan, will come.

649
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,200
Ask him to wait here.

650
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,560
- I'll go get the cheque.
- Ok dad.

651
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,600
I know you would be here on time.
Hence I've the cheque ready.

652
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,600
Thank you!

653
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,000
Here.

654
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,800
Uncle, where are you both going?

655
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,480
Dad asked me to meet him.

656
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,600
Jeeva.

657
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,720
Deposit this cheque for
clearing right away.

658
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,280
- I'll take him to the advocate's office.
- Ok dad.

659
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,640
Let's go?

660
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,320
Sir, is he your son?

661
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,200
Yes.

662
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,360
You have raised him
well with good values.

663
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,600
Can't you say it after he leaves?

664
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,120
Why say it in front of him?

665
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,280
You leave.

666
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Come on.

667
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,160
He neither praises me...

668
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,520
nor let others praise me.

669
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,840
How dare you?!

670
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,080
What is it Prabhu?

671
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,680
Who are you staring like that?

672
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,040
You will murder in the broad day light!

673
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,200
I just got nominated
as a candidate.

674
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,920
Do you wanna spoil my name?

675
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,320
Henceforth, until the
election is over...

676
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,920
no one must come here.

677
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,200
Get lost!

678
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
Get lost! You baldie!

679
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,240
I'll rip you apart.

680
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,920
Prabhu, I've spent a lot for this seat.

681
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,240
I must win.

682
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,120
Until then, ask our
men to keep quiet.

683
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,520
I want no problems.

684
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,800
Whatever it is, we shall
deal after winning.

685
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,800
Ok chief.

686
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,560
- Here.
- What?

687
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,320
Money.

688
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,640
- Don't you want?
- How much is that?

689
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,400
150

690
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,480
I want 250!

691
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,200
For what?

692
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,000
What's with the rude tone?

693
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,560
How dare you talk so rude?

694
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,680
Fine. Let me be kind.

695
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,400
75 one way and 75 for returning.

696
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,240
Total 150 right?

697
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,240
What about the in between
trip to the courier office?

698
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,000
Don't you say that!
I am already pissed off!

699
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,840
You better take this and leave.

700
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,040
- Leave?
- Yes!

701
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,240
You made me roam all over and
now you ask me to leave?

702
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,120
You are a rickshaw driver!

703
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,640
Yet I directed you
with the route.

704
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,400
So let me be reasonable.
Here, take this 100 and leave.

705
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,040
Why don't you have that too?

706
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,560
Fine. I am not paying you.
Leave.

707
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,480
Stop irritating me so early in the morning.
Just give me that.

708
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,920
I'll just pay 150.
That's it.

709
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,240
I need 200 at least.

710
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,080
Is it? Fine....

711
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,480
- Tell me your ID number.
- What ID?

712
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,000
Show me your license.
What's your name?

713
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,960
You can't intimidate me.

714
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,480
I am too from here and I am also
part of the rickshaw union.

715
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,280
Which union?
Which locality?

716
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,920
- What will you do?
- Wait!

717
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,720
You don't know who I am!
I am a journalist!

718
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,360
I'll report about you tomorrow.
I won't let this go so easy.

719
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,280
Tell me. Tell me
your rickshaw's ID!

720
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,680
I can't give that. You can't
even pay me reasonably!

721
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,400
I won't spare you! How dare you try to
charge me more? That too in my locality!

722
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,760
Leave me.

723
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,800
Brother.

724
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,960
- Brother?
- Yes brother.

725
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,680
How much?

726
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,440
From the top again?

727
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,880
Be polite.

728
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,080
75 up and 75 down.
Total 150 right?

729
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,280
What?

730
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,800
You! How much do you want?!

731
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,360
- Again the rude tone!
- Yes!

732
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,680
- There again!
- 150 right?

733
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,120
Here! Have this 500!

734
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,560
If I see you again around
here, I'll finish you off!

735
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,320
I asked 200 and you now pay me 500?
Are you retard?

736
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,880
How dare you don't mind me?
You are a goner!

737
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,000
Aunty!

738
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,720
Aunty!

739
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,360
What is it? Your screaming might
have proved fatal for me now!

740
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,040
I was involved in a spat outside.

741
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,120
I see nothing.

742
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,880
Right! Your son didn't
see it from outside.

743
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,200
You are is mom.
How could you have seen it?

744
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,480
Fine. Tell me. What happened?

745
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,680
Morning I got late...

746
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,000
Ask her and she'll add
too much fiction in it!

747
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,000
- Let me tell you.
- No. I'll tell.

748
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,680
If a man and woman lock horns,
whom will people hold up?

749
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,240
- Obviously a man.
- No aunty!

750
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,360
The whole street was
saving a man from her.

751
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,080
He is talking without
knowing the issue.

752
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,920
See that? She doesn't
allow me to speak!

753
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,520
Think about the
poor rickshaw guy.

754
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Poor fellow.

755
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,920
She is intimidating him
and he was hiding inside his rickshaw.

756
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,760
Over that she expects
me to help her.

757
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,960
He calls me a brat!

758
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,920
My brother usually
speaks the truth alone.

759
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,920
Today he did it with perfection.

760
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,120
That like it!

761
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,320
The whole family is attacking me!

762
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,240
Look at that.
Wiping away the false tears.

763
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Stop it!

764
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Poor kid.
Stop troubling her.

765
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,680
- Angannan?
- Yes sir.

766
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,280
I am his family lawyer.

767
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,240
How dare you complaint
against him to me?

768
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,040
Why do you wanna spoil
your peaceful life?

769
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,960
Why mess with him?

770
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Are you going to sacrifice
yourself for a piece of land?

771
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,840
I came to you because you are
the best advocate in town.

772
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,480
Its unfair when you
speak like this.

773
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,840
Oh! Oh! He is here.

774
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,440
Greetings.

775
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,680
Don't call yourself an advocate!

776
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,560
Didn't you complete
you MBBS properly?!

777
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
A pipe can carry pure
and impure water.

778
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,440
Similarly, a party meet will
have good things and issues.

779
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,640
Without knowing this charges
have been pressed against him!

780
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,080
Look! If again any charges
come against my chief....

781
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,200
Chief...

782
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,120
Sir, he is my friend.

783
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,200
Your men are threatening him to sell
his land to you. It's unfair.

784
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,760
This must be the last of it!

785
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,520
If I hear anything of such kind...

786
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,840
then before finishing them off,
I'll have to finish you off!

787
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,360
Why do you even need assistants?

788
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,720
Warn them advocate.

789
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,200
I'll lose my life in the process
of saving yours. Leave!

790
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,200
Come on.

791
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,920
Mom, B.E result...

792
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,240
Isn't she close by?

793
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,240
Dad.

794
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,120
What is it?

795
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,240
I am unable to solve this.

796
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,840
What's dad upset about?

797
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,120
I don't know.
He was fine.

798
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,360
- This one.
- Yes.

799
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,520
Look at her trying to impress him.

800
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,360
Sir...

801
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,080
Sir...

802
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,200
Come in Pandi.

803
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,640
Just come in.

804
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Sir, I need your help
to fill this form.

805
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,320
Is it for a loan from the bank?

806
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,240
No sir.

807
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,680
I want to put my son
in a private school.

808
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,920
I went to the school
premises last night itself.

809
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,120
There was a lengthy queue
today early morning.

810
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,200
I came straight to you after
getting the admission form.

811
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,360
Here.

812
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,120
This is a well reputed school.
Nice.

813
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,760
The form itself is
worth 500 bucks.

814
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,920
Not surprising.

815
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,760
Collect it tomorrow.

816
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,360
If you can fill it now,
I'll submit it right away.

817
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,720
It needs an attestation.

818
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,440
What was that?

819
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,520
I need to get an authorized sign.
I'll get it ready.

820
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,760
You may collect it tomorrow.

821
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
Ok sir. See you.

822
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,320
Jeeva.

823
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,640
Greetings.

824
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Yes!

825
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,920
If you have filled the form,
please hand it over at the office.

826
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,840
I'm not here for that.

827
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,080
Can you read out what's on
the 7th page of this form?

828
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,320
- Sit down.
- Its ok.

829
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,960
Its the terms and conditions.

830
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,560
It's fine that you have put
the terms and condition.

831
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,440
But this form is
worth 500 bucks.

832
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,120
You have mentioned that its non
refundable in the 1st page.

833
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,360
But if you had mentioned the criteria
to buy it in the same page then...

834
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,680
this person wouldn't have spent
his money unnecessarily.

835
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
We can't check the criteria
with each and everyone.

836
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,960
You don't have to check
everyone who buys the form.

837
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,240
You very well know...

838
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,760
whether the person buying
it is educated or not.

839
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,720
You could just have
asked him one question.

840
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,080
Whether the form was for him.

841
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,640
If you had explained,
he would have known it right...

842
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,320
...there that his son won't
get an admission here.

843
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,880
He could have that 500 bucks.

844
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,080
Today you are the scapegoat!

845
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,240
You are going to fill in only 50 seats...

846
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
but you have distributed
7000+ forms.

847
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,160
Even the literate...

848
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,240
feels that their kids will get the best
education here and in that hope...

849
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,040
wait in queue for hours
to buy your school forms.

850
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,640
I don't want to talk
much about them.

851
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,280
But the illiterates?

852
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,840
They don't know your rules.

853
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,000
They regret that
they are uneducated...

854
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,360
and hope to make their
children study well.

855
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,520
They sacrifice one of their job and...

856
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,160
wait in this lengthy
queue and buy this form.

857
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,880
In order to earn that 500 bucks...

858
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,960
he must wake up early and go to
at least 50 houses selling milk.

859
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,120
He earns that money with great difficulty
but you just take it away easily.

860
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,800
You say education is a must yet
you make business out of it.

861
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,520
To propel your business...

862
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,240
do not make the
downtrodden people...

863
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,560
believe that they don't
deserve education...

864
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,920
...and only the rich deserves it.

865
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,800
Come on Jeeva.

866
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,320
Why is the police coming here?

867
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,520
Officer is calling you.

868
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,200
For what?

869
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,800
To sponsor him a tea.

870
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,120
Shall I give some money?

871
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,480
- Come on.
- I don't have change.

872
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,480
Don't be afraid.

873
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,840
- Cops are not so powerful.
- I'm scared.

874
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,560
I'll handle this.
Come on.

875
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,480
Why do you look nervous?

876
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,680
Well, I am afraid of the police.

877
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,320
What?

878
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,520
I am no way linked to them.

879
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,840
I'll slap you!

880
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,000
I will decide that!

881
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,200
Did you guys witness the murder
that happened here 2 days ago?

882
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,600
People kill each other.
Why unnecessarily get involved?

883
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,720
We didn't witness.

884
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,880
Aren't you guys
from this locality?

885
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,800
7th street.

886
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,760
Usually you guys meet up
in this tea shop right?

887
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,880
Then where were you
the other day?

888
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,480
We were here
but left early.

889
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,160
Early?

890
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,560
Who keeps a check on time?

891
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Other day we had some work we left.
Today we are free so we are still here.

892
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,640
Fine.

893
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,280
Assemble at the Saidapet
court tomorrow morning.

894
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,560
But why sir?

895
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,040
You didn't witness
the murder right?

896
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,520
Are you sure?

897
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,600
Then come to the court
tomorrow morning.

898
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,160
Our men will be there.

899
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,480
Just be a witness and say
they were the murderers.

900
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,840
No way sir.

901
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,920
- Pitchai.
- Sir?

902
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,840
Put them in the jeep.

903
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,040
But why sir?

904
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,920
Weren't you guys smoking
on the streets?

905
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,080
Smoking is an offense in a public place.
Take them in.

906
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,400
- Sir, why are you unnecessarily...
- Excuse me sir!

907
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,120
- Who are you?
- Press.

908
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,040
- What?
- Press.

909
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,480
- Fine. I shall.
- Sir!

910
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,280
How dare you?

911
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,080
I now arrest for this!

912
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,920
Sir! Sir, they are college students.
It'll become an issue.

913
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,440
Also, she is from the press

914
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,560
Leave them sir.

915
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,360
Hope you know who
committed the murder.

916
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,600
He has said that his name
shouldn't appear in the news.

917
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,080
For that we need guys from this
locality, that too college guys...

918
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,560
who can give witness! Only then
the case will be compromised.

919
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,840
If we take weak witness, then
the case will keep prolonging.

920
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,520
Take them in.

921
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,280
Sir, I'll arrange you the witnesses.
Come with me.

922
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,040
You are from this locality right?

923
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,640
I'll catch you someday!

924
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,200
Leave now!

925
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,040
These both will never change!

926
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,080
It only happens in this
house and no where else.

927
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,840
Dad!

928
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Brother is here.

929
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,680
So what? Let him come.

930
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,200
When dad and son are at home...

931
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,800
all hell breaks lose on me.

932
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,440
He will refuse.

933
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,960
Then his dad will yell at him.

934
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,280
M.E?

935
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
What's the hurry?

936
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
At Coimbatore?

937
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,360
You will go right?

938
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,520
Sure!

939
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
He agreed right?

940
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,040
Now watch your mom follow him
with the coffee that has gone cold!

941
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,440
How did you do that?

942
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,200
- I know it!
- You are great dad!

943
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,480
Go tell him the truth now.
He won't listen to you later.

944
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,120
When did I lie?

945
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,480
You agreed to go to Coimbatore
for your higher studies.

946
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
I am going to Coimbatore for sure.

947
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,920
Are you going to leave
me and your friends?

948
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,120
Your question is justified.

949
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,360
In fact the truth is, it is
hard to leave you guys

950
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,560
But more than that
I'll be away from dad!

951
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,920
I am planning to have a peaceful
time for the next 2 years.

952
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,360
Looks like you won't allow me.

953
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,760
I brought you the coffee even after
it has gone cold. I need this!

954
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
Both you and your
dad are jobless!

955
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,120
- Give me the coffee.
- I am gonna throw it away.

956
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,800
Now, where is Danny?

957
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,880
Brother, how are you?

958
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,360
What are you doing here?

959
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Here to meet a friend.

960
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,720
So what about your son's
school admission?

961
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,560
I put him in a school
recommended by your dad.

962
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,000
It's a nice school and even
the fee is reasonable.

963
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
Awesome.

964
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,640
- I need to attend this.
- Fine, I'll leave.

965
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Ok.

966
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,760
Hello?

967
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,040
Look at his fate.

968
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,200
Any relatives of
Mr. Vardharajan?

969
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,760
- Give it to me.
- Here sir.

970
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,560
Greetings sir.

971
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,800
Are his relatives here?

972
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,360
That's him.

973
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,280
Sir...

974
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,200
Who are you to him?

975
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,120
His neighbor.

976
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,280
Was he an orphan?

977
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,120
No sir.

978
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,280
He has a daughter.

979
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,480
Only he and his daughter.

980
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,760
I know for the past 15 years.

981
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,640
Forget that.

982
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,920
Will his daughter
be able to sign...

983
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,840
or has she expired too?

984
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Why would you talk like that?

985
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,720
She is already depressed.

986
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,880
Have some humanity.

987
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,440
If I gotta be polite
to everybody then...

988
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,440
I can't attend more
than 2 cases per day.

989
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Give me an answer.

990
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,880
Will she sign the papers or not?

991
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,480
I'll sign it sir.

992
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,680
I am school teacher.

993
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,840
I'll face if anything
comes up regarding this.

994
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,160
Look at that.
Are you that big a man?

995
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,000
- What's the issue dad?
- Nothing.

996
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,000
There you go!

997
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,600
Tell him and he'll solve everything.

998
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,600
I shall furnish even my school details.
I'll sign the papers.

999
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,440
Fine. You say that you
are his neighbor.

1000
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,080
Sign it.

1001
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,040
- You.
- Sir...

1002
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
- Get his signature.
- Ok sir.

1003
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,000
- You better have some respect for him!
- Jeeva!

1004
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,640
What?

1005
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,720
- What do you mean?
- Nothing sir.

1006
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,640
Shall I fall on his feet
before getting his sign?

1007
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,320
Sir, this guy isn't
worth your time!

1008
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,680
You can do much better.

1009
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,040
Much better?

1010
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,360
Sounds fishy to me.

1011
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,880
Go get his signature.

1012
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,440
Anyone who wants to
have one final look?

1013
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,520
Please take her away.

1014
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,640
You can't take the girl away
right after the funeral.

1015
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,840
Why do we need your permission to
take away our relative with us?

1016
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,720
I am not saying that I must allow.

1017
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,640
All I am saying is
ask her permission.

1018
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,920
You are right

1019
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,720
But tell me how many
times have you visited them?

1020
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,600
Do you have any idea about that
girl or her qualification?

1021
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,080
You don't know anything about her.

1022
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,520
But you want to take her away.

1023
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,040
So won't you allow
us now to take her?

1024
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,600
I am not stopping you.

1025
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,680
Talk to her and take her away if
she is willing to come with you.

1026
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,520
Please come in.

1027
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,880
Please give us 3 days time.

1028
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,160
I'll talk to her
and convince her.

1029
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,880
- Please don't make any hasty...
- Did you have your food?

1030
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,200
She haven't even had water.

1031
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,680
How can we eat?

1032
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,640
Leave me!

1033
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,840
I said come! Come!

1034
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,240
Come on now!

1035
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,520
I won't come. Leave me!

1036
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,040
- Please! No!
- Get in!

1037
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,400
Start! Quick. Before the
neighbors come out.

1038
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,600
All the girls back in native...

1039
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,240
are not at all good.

1040
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,400
I am gonna marry her right
away after we reach.

1041
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,160
Is that why I came down
all the way with my men?

1042
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,560
Oh so you already have a plan?

1043
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,320
I don't want marriage now!
Let me stay here itself please!

1044
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,960
Help! Help!

1045
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,920
Don't you scream!

1046
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,040
I'll slap you!

1047
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,080
What's with the sudden brake?!

1048
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,440
Look! There is
another competitor.

1049
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,520
That the reason for sudden brake.

1050
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,520
Hey!

1051
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,800
Where are you trying to escape?!

1052
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,920
Why are you blocking our way?

1053
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,920
Let her out.

1054
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,040
Why do I need your permission
to take away my relative?

1055
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,760
We won't even let a girl's father
take her away without her consent!

1056
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,600
I don't even know you!

1057
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,600
How can I allow?

1058
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,800
Thrash him!

1059
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,760
Jeeva! Jeeva!

1060
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,960
- Stop!
- Leave me!

1061
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,280
Only when a damsel
in distress...

1062
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,680
we find out the real
capability of a friend.

1063
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,760
There is no one I could bash up.
Everyone's so huge!

1064
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,800
Leave me!

1065
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,680
I should have sent the juniors.
Master!

1066
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,240
Jeeva!

1067
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,160
Don't tighten your grip!
He is a don's right hand.

1068
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,360
Jeeva!

1069
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,680
You like violence.

1070
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,400
But I like silence.

1071
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,200
One more word and I'll go crazy.

1072
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,680
I expected a lot more
than that from him.

1073
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,320
Come on master.
What was that all about?

1074
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,880
You saw him thrashing others.

1075
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,640
Start now.
Let's reach home safe.

1076
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,920
I was stepping out in search of you.

1077
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,280
You brought her back?

1078
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,480
Why is your shirt torn?

1079
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,480
Well...

1080
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,600
when I went to bring her back,
there was a small issue.

1081
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,600
Did you fight?

1082
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,240
Won't you ever pay heed to me?

1083
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,240
Why did you fight?

1084
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,000
I didn't start it. I didn't
go there with that intention.

1085
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,240
You! Wasn't this all for you?

1086
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,440
Tell him!

1087
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
Yes uncle.

1088
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,920
There is nothing wrong with you.
Bringing you back was a good thing.

1089
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,120
You go inside.

1090
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,360
There is a way to do things.

1091
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,840
What wrong way did I adopt?

1092
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,880
I told them to leave her. They refused.
I bashed them up and got her back.

1093
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,520
- Why not go to the police?
- Police?

1094
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,360
You mean the rude guy who
spoke to you in the mortuary?

1095
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,720
If you complaint to him that a girl
is being forcefully taken away...

1096
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,680
he will abduct her.

1097
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,840
It's better for her to
go with them instead.

1098
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,800
We could have had
proper talks with him.

1099
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,760
Last time you spoke,
nothing happened.

1100
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
What is that you are
trying to prove?

1101
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,800
I didn't commit a blunder.

1102
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,360
I saved her from being
taken against her will.

1103
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,360
So you will fight and you want me
to be quiet about it? Isn't it?

1104
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,160
Swathi!

1105
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,200
Come in.

1106
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,840
You too come in. Have your food.

1107
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,760
- Excuse me!
- Escaped!

1108
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,280
Can't you see me
confronting him?

1109
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,520
You are the one spoiling him.

1110
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,000
He is spoilt right? So be it.

1111
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,320
Of course, dresses
will spoil in a fight.

1112
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,880
No one even cares
what I have to say!

1113
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,840
Here.

1114
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,000
What is this?

1115
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,000
Well, what's the hurry?

1116
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,920
Don't give me any reasons.

1117
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,200
Got it?

1118
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,400
Outburst for yesterday's event?

1119
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:11,960
What?

1120
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,720
Nothing. Where should I sign?

1121
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,560
I've marked it with pencil.

1122
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,440
I've filled everything.
Including the pin code.

1123
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,280
There is nothing
left for you to do.

1124
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,200
Go to your college.
Get you original mark sheets.

1125
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,560
I have even placed the pin
to attach it, inside the cover.

1126
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,960
Ok.

1127
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,640
See how your husband's
plays games?

1128
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,760
What's the hurry?

1129
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,280
I just convinced him.
Don't you start from the top again.

1130
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,040
Leave.

1131
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,840
Why are you staring at me?

1132
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,680
Jeeva, you fought
for me yesterday.

1133
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,600
Is that why he is sending
you away to Coimbatore?

1134
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,000
Hey! This was decided way before.
It has nothing to do with you.

1135
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,720
Don't get confused.

1136
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,360
Forget everything
and go to work.

1137
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,840
Ok? I'll be back.

1138
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,880
Good morning sir.

1139
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,880
Yeah right! Stop your
over acting first.

1140
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,560
Good morning sir.

1141
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,320
You have passed with a 1st class.
Congrats.

1142
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,960
Thank you sir.

1143
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,840
Yes Mr. Japan.

1144
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,400
Who is your current girl friend?

1145
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,800
Come sir.
Don't pull my leg.

1146
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,280
Fine. Sign properly and leave.

1147
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,560
Sir, why only one
signature from him?

1148
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,000
But you want me to sign
at so many places?

1149
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,280
If you had backlogs like him then
you will have to come here again.

1150
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,200
You have passed with good marks.

1151
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,480
Will you ever come back here?

1152
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,600
Got it? Ok?

1153
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,280
- Isn't lady shopkeeper available.
- Tell me what you want! Photocopy?

1154
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,000
Original certificates
have no value here.

1155
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,880
What am I going to do
with a photocopy?

1156
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,880
How many copies?

1157
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,080
2 copies.

1158
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,560
Shall I take?

1159
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,280
You will need pen to
write your backlogs.

1160
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,400
Like earlier I used to write a lot.
Come on now.

1161
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,840
You just won't change!

1162
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,000
Any issue with the college?

1163
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,080
No. Why?

1164
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,000
It's mentioned as bad here.

1165
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,600
Even he has a good in the
conduct certificate.

1166
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,800
I am rank holder. I can't get bad.

1167
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,080
Look for yourself.

1168
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,320
Indeed. It's mentioned as bad.

1169
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,440
- Come on.
- Let's go check it.

1170
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,080
Here. Take this too.

1171
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,600
Careful.

1172
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,760
Why are they rushing?

1173
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,640
- What happened?
- They mentioned Jeeva's conduct as bad.

1174
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,520
What?!

1175
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,200
Please come.

1176
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,400
Sir...

1177
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,120
what is this?

1178
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,280
Look, my job is to only
issue the certificate.

1179
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
Go check with the principal.
Now leave.

1180
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,560
- Sir! Sir! Sir!
- Don't allow anyone.

1181
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,640
Even my conduct is mentioned as good.

1182
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,240
Even I don't believe it.
Wonder how my dad will?

1183
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,480
Discipline, this word...

1184
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,680
My dad wants me to become a
professor after completing my M.E.

1185
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,400
He say that I am undisciplined.

1186
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,280
Do I need to more
disciplined that this?

1187
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,920
You have raised him well.

1188
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,200
- Sir.
- Marimuthu come with me.

1189
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,480
- Meeting is going on.
- Just come!

1190
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,440
Buddy! Buddy!

1191
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,880
Buddy! He left. You go
meet the principal. Go!

1192
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,080
Sir...

1193
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,880
Please come.

1194
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,200
Are you here to bid good bye?

1195
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,320
Yes sir.

1196
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,840
But...

1197
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,200
Tell me Jeeva. What is it?
Just say it.

1198
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,800
Sir, there has been a mistake.

1199
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,680
- Any correction with the name?
- No. That is correct.

1200
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,920
Then?

1201
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,880
My conduct has been declared as
bad in the conduct certificate.

1202
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,200
If everything else is correct
then this must also be correct.

1203
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,960
I've studied here for 4 years

1204
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,400
My dad has never been year
except on the joining day.

1205
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,160
I've never create an issue here.

1206
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,240
Never have I been summoned
by you for any wrong doings.

1207
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,560
Then how can my conduct
be declared as bad?

1208
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,120
Isn't this your signature?

1209
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,240
Sir, this never happened!

1210
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,440
I've never signed on anything
with such declaration.

1211
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,960
Whose signature is it?

1212
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,720
Sir..the signature...

1213
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,080
It's indeed my signature.

1214
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,480
Do you say someone
else forged it?

1215
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,440
Why so many signatures from me?

1216
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,720
Sir, I get it now!

1217
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,880
When I was collecting the certificate,
I signed in few papers...

1218
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,480
I blame you and you blame
the college in turn?

1219
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,040
Sir, I am not playing
any blame game here.

1220
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,800
I don't mind failing
in few subjects.

1221
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,080
But the only thing that
my dad expects from me...

1222
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,280
is what has been screwed up
here, in the certificate.

1223
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,960
Sir, why did you this?

1224
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,600
Let me explain that!

1225
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,200
He is the correspondent
of our college.

1226
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,040
I was the one who ordered your
conduct to be declared as bad.

1227
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,680
I have seen you somewhere.

1228
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,440
Oh! You?

1229
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,160
Didn't I apologize
the other day?

1230
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,840
I would have ripped you apart
the moment you slapped me.

1231
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,680
Wondering why I didn't do it?

1232
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,400
I hit a person where
it hurts him.

1233
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,200
Like, if you were an artist...

1234
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,440
I would have blinded you...

1235
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,920
and then torture you by
forcing you to paint.

1236
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,080
If you were a business man...

1237
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,360
I would have snatched away all your
wealth and turned you into a beggar.

1238
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,280
But then you ain't that worthy!

1239
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,440
You know why I made
you come here?

1240
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,520
The first person to provoke me so bad...

1241
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,520
Is you!

1242
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,760
These 7 days were hell!

1243
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,920
But now I am very happy!

1244
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,080
Look. I'll even fall on
your feet and apologize!

1245
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,120
What is this?

1246
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,560
I ain't the god to forgive
when you fall at my feet.

1247
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,800
I am the lord of death who
will rewrite your fate.

1248
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,240
Even if you want to fall
at my feet hereafter...

1249
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,160
you must ask my permission.

1250
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,960
I have heard that your dad is
the epitome of discipline?

1251
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,760
Show him the certificate,
then frame it and...

1252
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,240
then ask him to commit
suicide for being ashamed!

1253
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,240
How dare you?!

1254
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,080
Leave me! How dare he talk
about my dad like that?

1255
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,240
- Sir sorry sir.
- How dare he be so arrogant?!

1256
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,560
I won't spare you!

1257
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,800
Look here...

1258
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,000
this must be the last
time you get furious.

1259
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,960
Leave me. He has insulted me by
declaring my conduct as bad!

1260
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,440
I'll let you know soon.

1261
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,880
So be ready!

1262
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,840
Just take him away!

1263
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,680
Come on! Leave!

1264
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,680
Stop it! If he had insulted
your dad, would you keep quiet?

1265
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,080
Jeeva...

1266
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,800
I know what happened.
There is no use talking to them.

1267
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,200
Go meet his dad.

1268
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,360
Who is his dad?

1269
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,160
Angannan.

1270
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,360
Opponent party MLA murdered
in broad day light.

1271
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,600
Chief, who are they?

1272
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,000
Stand here and keep asking!

1273
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,240
Let them come here and then I shall ask.

1274
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,000
Greetings sir.

1275
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,400
Youth organization?

1276
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,800
Do you want me to be
chief guest for any of your function?

1277
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,440
No.

1278
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,400
Recommendation? Donation?
Or an invitation?

1279
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,280
Tell us whatever it is.

1280
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,560
Sir, well...

1281
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,400
Come on now.
What's with the formalities?

1282
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,720
Either talk to me as your
brother or as your chief.

1283
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,480
What is it?

1284
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,720
I am student in your college.

1285
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,720
Which college?

1286
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,840
MVK.

1287
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,040
Chief, it's one of our college.

1288
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,920
Is it? Tell me, what is it?

1289
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,680
Well...

1290
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,480
my conduct has been declared
bad in the certificate.

1291
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,880
Is it declared as pad?

1292
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,840
Pad?

1293
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,680
Was it written pad?

1294
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,440
Do they write such
stuff in certificates?

1295
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,360
Didn't you say it was
written something else?

1296
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,120
He is blabbering like a fool!
You stop now!

1297
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,880
It's not pad sir...

1298
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,640
- It's bad.
- Bad?

1299
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,040
Did you pay the fee?

1300
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,120
I've paid it on time.

1301
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,600
Then why did they do so?
We got what we needed.

1302
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,880
Do you have the fee
receipt with you?

1303
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,560
I do have.

1304
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,880
What's your name?

1305
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,600
Jeevanand.

1306
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,640
You take that receipt and go
to the college tomorrow morning.

1307
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,360
- Talk to the principal and do the needful.
- Ok.

1308
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,200
Listen did you
guys join the party?

1309
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,960
Sir, we would love to.

1310
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,480
Next time when you come
join our party.

1311
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,440
Become a member.

1312
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,040
Ok?

1313
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,160
Yay! Yes!

1314
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,200
After joining the party
don't wear such attires.

1315
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,920
You must wear whites or they
won't allow you inside.

1316
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,720
Now leave. I'll take care of it.
Leave.

1317
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,000
- Thank you sir.
- Ok.

1318
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,040
I don't think he knows
that you slapped his son.

1319
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,760
After getting the certificate
don't even think of coming here.

1320
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,880
Why would I?

1321
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,120
Why he sitting like this?

1322
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,880
What are you doing here?

1323
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,720
I was about to go home.

1324
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,120
Wonder what I will tell dad?

1325
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,800
- He will ask if I applied for M.E.
- I'll lie.

1326
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,560
Go a bit late like
you usually go.

1327
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,120
Leave early from home tomorrow.

1328
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,560
Get the job done and
then go back confidently.

1329
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,880
That's right.

1330
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,040
Fine, I'll leave.

1331
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,320
So soon?

1332
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,120
Dad must be asleep by now.

1333
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,920
Mom will be awake and waiting.

1334
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,760
Give me the file else
your mom might see it.

1335
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,880
You are back early today.

1336
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,320
Nothing mom.

1337
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,400
- Is dad asleep?
- Jeeva.

1338
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,720
Not yet?

1339
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,840
What do I say?

1340
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,400
He had his dinner at 8 and
then went to the terrace.

1341
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,600
Now go or he'll get furious.

1342
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,120
Dad.

1343
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,600
What happened at
the college today?

1344
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,360
Nothing dad.

1345
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,120
You have been to that
college for 4 years.

1346
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,880
Have I ever questioned you once
about any of your activities?

1347
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,960
So if I am questioning you now
means that I know what happened.

1348
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,960
Fine.

1349
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,840
Has anyone come to our home
complaining about you?

1350
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,000
No dad.

1351
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,800
Has anyone abused us
because of you?

1352
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,440
Do you have any idea how
happy I am because of you?

1353
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,840
If the father of the goes
to sleep early and wakes-

1354
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,680
-up early means he has
a worry free son. Isn't it?

1355
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,080
I came to your college with you
passport photo that you forgot.

1356
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,680
I got the news from there.

1357
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,240
That my son behaved in a
very undisciplined manner.

1358
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,000
Do you think I will when
someone judges my son?

1359
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,440
Everyday you come home late after
hanging out with your friends.

1360
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,320
Today you came early.

1361
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,920
That too worried that
I might say something.

1362
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,800
I never use to feel bad
when you reach home late.

1363
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,320
But today I feel bad.

1364
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,520
Of course I am being
too strict with you.

1365
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,880
Why?

1366
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,840
A son who fails in discipline
and a daughter-

1367
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,160
-who fails in marriage will
struggle in their life.

1368
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,080
That is why I am strict.

1369
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,800
You scored good marks.

1370
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,240
I told you to study
mechanical engineering.

1371
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,120
You too did it without saying a word.

1372
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,600
Do you know why I asked you to
study Mechanical engineering?

1373
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,440
From a small screw to the airplane,
mechanical department has a big hand.

1374
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,960
Mechanical related jobs
will live forever.

1375
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,400
I wanted you to become a
professor in that domain.

1376
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,000
I don't want my son
to discover things.

1377
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,280
All I wanted is you to
become a professor...

1378
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,840
...and then turn at least 100 students
into best mechanical engineers.

1379
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,880
I strongly believe that
you will achieve it!

1380
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,720
Do you think I believe if someone
declares your conduct as bad?

1381
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,920
No dad.

1382
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,520
They said that it will
be modified tomorrow.

1383
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,320
I'll be happy if it happens.

1384
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,680
Jeeva...

1385
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,320
if you are hesitant to talk something
to me then I become your weakness.

1386
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,520
I say it now...

1387
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,600
I will always be your strength and
never shall I be your weakness!

1388
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,440
Had your food?

1389
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,880
No dad.

1390
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,280
Come, let's go down.

1391
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,560
Jeeva.

1392
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,640
Coming daddy.

1393
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,440
He wakes up sharp at 6...

1394
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,560
but he is still asleep.

1395
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,400
I wonder what both, daddy and
son were discussing last night.

1396
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,120
I was wondering why are
you still asleep. It's 7.

1397
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,240
7? Is the coffee ready?

1398
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,400
Let me brush my teeth.

1399
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,680
This is a new.
Working in the morning?

1400
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,160
Where are you leaving so early?

1401
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,400
I need to go to the college
and submit the form.

1402
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,440
So you are going to do what he orders.
Fine eat and leave.

1403
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,440
I'll come back and eat.

1404
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,440
Don't you leave on
an empty stomach.

1405
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,240
He left without
having his breakfast?

1406
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,120
There he is.

1407
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,920
Got caught at home?

1408
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,480
Dad knew everything.

1409
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,600
Oh God!
Then?

1410
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,160
Only during our tough times we
know who are our real loved ones.

1411
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,160
The only relief at this bad hour
is the love my dad has for me.

1412
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,560
My aim is now to complete
M.E and become a professor.

1413
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,320
Buddy!

1414
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,080
Sounds awesome. All the best.

1415
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,600
You can do it!

1416
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,320
Didn't I tell you guys
that he'll make it?

1417
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,560
Dude, I need your bike urgently.

1418
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,720
- It's time. I need to go to the college.
- I'll be back soon then you can go.

1419
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,880
- Take his bike.
- His bike?

1420
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,640
He keeps the petrol tank dry!

1421
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,760
I can't take his bike.

1422
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,000
Thank god. I thought you would
have already left for college.

1423
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,200
Thank god you are here.

1424
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,000
Please give me your bike.

1425
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,080
- Fine, I'll go in his bike.
- Awesome!

1426
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,160
- Bye.
- Fine.

1427
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,240
I thought this issue will
end in the college itself.

1428
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,000
Now again I've to
meet that person.

1429
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,720
Forget it dude.
He would've been busy.

1430
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,320
And now this call!

1431
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,360
Tell me.

1432
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,280
Finish him of right away!

1433
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,360
- Buddy! A small problem.
- What happened?

1434
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,520
My dad is drunk and he is creating a
ruckus. I'll be back in half an hour.

1435
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,520
Half an hour?

1436
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,880
Ask him how long will it take?

1437
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,520
Can I meet the chief?

1438
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,440
He is in an important meeting.
Please wait for some time.

1439
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,440
Fine buddy.
I'll be back.

1440
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,400
Hey! My file!

1441
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,680
Hello?

1442
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,560
Jeeva...

1443
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,080
- Had your food?
- Not yet.

1444
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,560
- What about the certificates?
- I'll talk to you later.

1445
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,320
I wonder what happened?

1446
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,120
Why did you take him along?

1447
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,000
You!

1448
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,880
If you had joined me then why
would I invite your dad?

1449
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,600
Listen, even drunkard
needs dedication.

1450
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,440
I am talking to you. With
whom are you talking?

1451
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,360
Where are you?

1452
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,320
Buddy! I'll be there in half an hour.
Please.

1453
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,960
No thanks.
Stay there!

1454
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,720
Don't you want to
go have some food?

1455
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,720
Listen dear you didn't
even have proper breakfast.

1456
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,960
Even now you aren't
concentrating on your food.

1457
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,160
Did Jeeva call?

1458
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,200
It's already 2 and there
is no news about him.

1459
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,080
What if I go to eat
and chief comes out.

1460
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,480
Will his meeting be over soon?

1461
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,800
I have no idea dear.

1462
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,680
Why is he waiting?

1463
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,920
No idea. He has been
waiting since morning.

1464
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,640
Listen leave and
come back tomorrow.

1465
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,080
I'll meet him even
its a little late.

1466
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,720
How long will you wait like
this without having any food?

1467
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,320
Listen dear!

1468
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,560
- Chief they won't talk about us again.
- Greetings sir.

1469
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,680
I told you to go to college
but why are you here?

1470
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,120
I went to college but they said that
they didn't receive any information.

1471
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,320
So I thought I'll
meet you and...

1472
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,240
If they told you that
around morning 10....

1473
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,760
why are you coming to
meet me so late, it's 4?

1474
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,000
Didn't you crawl from there to here?

1475
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,120
I came at morning 10.

1476
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,320
The security didn't allow me.

1477
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,880
This is how my name spoils.

1478
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,000
What will you say? I went
to Angannan's house....

1479
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,520
I was made to the whole day.
No one even minded me.

1480
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,680
Do one thing, come here
tomorrow morning at sharp 9.

1481
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,000
- You! Come here!
- Yes sir.

1482
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,880
He will be here at
tomorrow morning 9...

1483
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,360
Ok sir.

1484
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,080
- Arrange a chair for him to sit.
- Ok sir.

1485
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,240
So be here at morning 9.

1486
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,560
If anyone comes...

1487
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:39,880
I don't want to hear that they were
made to wait and call me arrogant.

1488
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,960
You know whom to allow. You
are well educated. Ok?

1489
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,680
Sir!

1490
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,840
I am not here to request you for a job.

1491
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,120
I am here for my certificate.

1492
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,800
After that what are
you going to do?

1493
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,160
Try for a job, right?

1494
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,680
Instead I am giving you a job.

1495
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,720
D comes after E. See
even I am educated.

1496
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,320
So, take charge from tomorrow.

1497
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,080
So, see you.

1498
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,760
Sir!

1499
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,040
So you won't modify
my certificate?

1500
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,120
You will slap my son and still
you expect me to oblige?

1501
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,640
If I want, I can destroy
you without a trace.

1502
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,120
Since I am competing in the
election, I'm letting you go.

1503
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,360
So what about my certificate?

1504
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,720
How dare you keep talking
about the certificate?

1505
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,440
This won't work out.

1506
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,560
Give him a nice thrashing.

1507
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,760
Not so hard, he has to come
for work tomorrow.

1508
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,800
Hey! Shut up!

1509
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,960
- Hey hold him!
- Wait! Move away from the car!

1510
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,400
Watch out or you might get hurt.

1511
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,360
Leave me!

1512
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,840
- Can't you just obey him?
- Do you want to get busted up?

1513
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,880
Leave him.

1514
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,600
Such innocent people
never revolt.

1515
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,160
- One 7 up please.
- Here you go.

1516
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,160
Excuse me.
Who is Bhoominathan here?

1517
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,840
Why? Why are you looking for Bhoomi?

1518
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,040
I shall only tell it to him.

1519
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:15,440
I am Bhoomi. Just tell me.

1520
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,680
I need a room to
stay for the night.

1521
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,360
- You are alone right?
- Yes, I am alone.

1522
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,760
How much can you afford?

1523
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,680
150 bucks.

1524
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,360
What do you get for
that money these days?

1525
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,440
Just for the night.
I'll leave early by 5.

1526
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,480
I'll come.

1527
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,560
Give me that money.

1528
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,440
Why are you locking the
door from outside?

1529
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,480
It's for your safety.

1530
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,400
What safety are you talking about?

1531
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,240
You want a room for 150 bucks...

1532
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,280
you shouldn't talk and
over that you ask question?

1533
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,160
Ok.

1534
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,080
Where are you from?

1535
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,080
Mettupalayam.

1536
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,480
Anyone who comes from
there, refer them to me for rooms. Ok?

1537
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,360
Ok.

1538
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,280
Here is your room.

1539
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,760
Your good time.
It's free to occupy.

1540
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,160
Why is the room so dark?

1541
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,440
Switch on the light.

1542
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,600
Come on now!
This is a toilet.

1543
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:10,120
Then for 150 bucks do
you expect a posh room?

1544
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,000
All you want is a room to stay
for the night, and leave early.

1545
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,160
What more do you expect?

1546
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,280
If you don't want it the forget it.
I've another two parties waiting.

1547
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,360
It's fine.
I'll stay here.

1548
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,600
Wonder where such
doofus turn up from?!

1549
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,240
Oh! Is he?

1550
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,680
Once he starts to
advice he won't stop!

1551
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,400
Hello. Tell me.

1552
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,440
Where is Jeeva?

1553
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,600
Must be in the ground.
Didn't he reach home yet?

1554
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,000
Not yet. I called him but his
number is not reachable.

1555
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,640
Ok. I'll go check
and give you a call.

1556
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,400
Please ask him to
call me immediately.

1557
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,120
Ok.

1558
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,920
Why isn't he home yet?

1559
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,920
Where did he go?

1560
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,680
What's up brother?

1561
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,840
Hope your body is
trembling in pain.

1562
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,600
After a long time I've got you.

1563
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,520
We are going to torture
you nice and slow.

1564
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,800
You! Slam few unclaimed
charges on him.

1565
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,800
6 months! No! At least for 15 days
I must remand him to custody.

1566
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,760
So...

1567
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,120
it's fine that you
messed with me.

1568
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,680
Why did you mess with them?

1569
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,160
We will maximum put you behind the
bars for 6 months and then let you go.

1570
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,120
But them?

1571
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,120
They will keep
torturing you forever.

1572
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,920
They will finish you off!

1573
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,720
Its bad time for
your whole locality.

1574
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,120
Remember the other day you
messed with me at the mortuary?

1575
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,960
Do you know how
that man died?

1576
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,320
In that 150 acre deal only one
person is not ready to sell.

1577
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,720
It's fine if they are ready to
pay the amount I brought it for.

1578
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,800
Your men are threatening him to
sell his land for half the price.

1579
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,600
Before finishing them
off, I'll finish you off.

1580
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,080
Anganna framed an accident
to finish him off.

1581
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,720
Forget him. Do you know
how brutal his son is?

1582
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,680
Whenever you let me go, I'll make sure to
publish all your atrocities in the media.

1583
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,880
Only if you can talk right?

1584
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,120
Hold him!

1585
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,280
6 feet tall and he chopped
him in to two pieces!

1586
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,720
Change the autopsy report for
this as an accident case.

1587
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:01,920
You are nothing to them.

1588
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,520
You can't approach anyone
to help you against them.

1589
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,880
You can't go anywhere either.

1590
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,080
Where ever you go, these
guys will come to know.

1591
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,240
You fate is sealed in
the hands of his son.

1592
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,160
I am the lord of death,
who will write your fate.

1593
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,800
You guys haven't
thrashed him enough.

1594
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,960
Give me the Lathi!

1595
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,480
I can't catch a break!

1596
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,000
Hello?

1597
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,480
Chief?

1598
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,440
Where are you?

1599
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,440
At the police station.

1600
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,480
I'm thrashing that guy who was pestering
you to modify his certificate.

1601
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,040
Why are you thrashing him?

1602
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,040
He is an innocent. He would have hit my son
when my son would've been drunk and high.

1603
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,920
I am asking you to hunt the shark
and you are playing with the frog!

1604
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,840
You leave him alone.
My son will take care of him.

1605
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,560
Throw him away and
reach here in 30 mins.

1606
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,480
Or else I throw you
away somewhere!

1607
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,600
Ok chief. I'll be there.

1608
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,560
Tie him up and take him.
We will throw him away on the way.

1609
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,800
Why so slow?
Make it fast!

1610
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,640
Doctor!

1611
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,800
What happened?

1612
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,320
We were riding on the bike
and met with an accident.

1613
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,360
- Take him to the ICU.
- You wait here.

1614
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,880
There he is.

1615
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,600
Why did you ask us to come here?
What's the emergency?

1616
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,360
- Jeeva met with an accident.
- Accident?

1617
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,240
Jeeva!
What do you mean?!

1618
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,160
He slipped from the bike.
Nothing major.

1619
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,600
I hope you didn't
inform his family.

1620
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,800
I did already.

1621
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,320
Why would you do that? They'll
be shocked and worried.

1622
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,120
Do you think I did
it on purpose?

1623
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,960
- On my way I called them up.
- Excuse me...

1624
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,360
please get this medicines.

1625
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,280
Do you have money with you?

1626
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,760
I have money with me.
Come on.

1627
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,720
Look, his parents will
be here any minute.

1628
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,200
Don't you blabber anything.

1629
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,080
I am already upset!

1630
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,000
Where is he?

1631
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,600
- What happened?
- Nothing to worry.

1632
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,640
Where is he?

1633
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,880
- Please wait.
- Why?

1634
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,120
The treatment is underway.
They won't allow any one.

1635
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,440
- Small bike accident.
- Bike?

1636
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,360
Don't worry.

1637
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,840
I felt something was fishy when
he left on a empty stomach.

1638
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,280
What's the rush?

1639
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,040
He just slipped.
Just minor injuries.

1640
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,800
If so then why he is
here at the hospital?

1641
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,080
Doctor said nothing to worry.

1642
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,560
Why is there blood
on your shirt?

1643
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,520
What happened?

1644
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,160
Nothing serious.
Doctors are on it.

1645
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,320
The treatment is underway.

1646
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,760
Why is he in the hospital
if it's not serious?

1647
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,520
You said minor injuries yet
why so many medicines?

1648
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,840
Please don't crowd here.
Wait at the reception.

1649
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,720
Ok. Ok.

1650
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,000
Ok.
Move dear.

1651
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,920
Where is the ICU entrance?

1652
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,720
This way.

1653
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,360
- This way? Thanks.
- Ok.

1654
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,520
What is it?

1655
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,840
Don't you come there and say

1656
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,000
"We have done our best
rest is in the hands of the god."

1657
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,200
They are shocked. Tell them
he'll be fine in 3 days.

1658
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,000
Nothing to worry. Doctor says...

1659
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,720
Nothing to worry sir.

1660
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,840
His nose it broken. He has lost blood.
He'll be fine after 3 hours of rest.

1661
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,680
Ok doctor.

1662
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,280
- Can I go see him?
- Sure.

1663
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,240
Go one by one.

1664
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,120
Madam.

1665
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,520
You can't go in.

1666
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,120
When the visitor inside comes
out then you may go in.

1667
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,320
Now what mom?

1668
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,680
Do pay the bills.

1669
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,640
Ok.

1670
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,920
He has been busted up.

1671
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,520
I know it for sure!

1672
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,280
We just give him the
initial treatment here.

1673
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,800
We can't guarantee
his safety here.

1674
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,000
Take him away from here and
get treated elsewhere.

1675
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,160
Can he be discharged now?

1676
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,760
I'll discharge him
tomorrow morning.

1677
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,560
Look he is hurt real bad.

1678
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,240
Nothing to worry. Let him rest.

1679
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,760
Will someone get hurt so bad
if they fell off the bike?

1680
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,040
Didn't the doctor say that
there is nothing to worry?

1681
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,080
Why are you worried?

1682
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,320
I told him many time earlier!

1683
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,480
I have warned him
from driving rash!

1684
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,040
Doctor said that he can be
discharged in the morning.

1685
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,200
Oh ok.

1686
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,200
"58, 59 and 60"

1687
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,200
Prabhu...

1688
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,040
Distribute it to everyone.

1689
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,440
No one should oppose us.

1690
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,480
Did Pugazhendi accept to this?

1691
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,320
If that was the case then
there is nothing to worry.

1692
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,520
Everything is fine but
why did you let him go?

1693
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,680
Who are you talking about?

1694
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,200
The guy who slapped your son.

1695
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,320
I heard that you even stopped the inspector
when he was about to thrash him.

1696
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,720
Don't talk like he
is a worthy person!

1697
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,480
Just for a little thrashing,
he must be now...

1698
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,720
...at home looking at
the wounds in the mirror.

1699
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,080
Jeeva.

1700
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,760
Sit down.

1701
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,760
I am afraid.

1702
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,840
Why should we be afraid?

1703
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,640
I revolted because he was wrong.

1704
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,920
I even apologized.

1705
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,320
Only you and mom have the
power to decide my fate.

1706
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,240
In fact...

1707
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,360
even the invisible god
doesn't have that privilege.

1708
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,880
He is a stranger to me!

1709
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,120
Who is he to decide my future?

1710
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,360
Other day, when there was murder
on the street I didn't bother.

1711
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,360
Swathi's dad was murder yet
we couldn't do anything. Could we?

1712
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,440
Again he is creating issue.

1713
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,480
It's not about that.

1714
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,120
Can we move legally?

1715
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,600
Come on dad!
Think again.

1716
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,800
This might appear
normal to others...

1717
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,000
- This is my life.
- I get your point.

1718
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,280
But if we revolt then I worry that
this might blow out of proportion.

1719
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,160
Dad!

1720
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,960
I am your son.
I must prove my innocence.

1721
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,480
Everyone points you as an
example for being disciplined.

1722
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,000
Who is he to declare your
son's conduct as bad?

1723
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,480
Over that, his son returns in 10 days
and he wants me to be his slave.

1724
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,280
Shall I work under him, as his slave?

1725
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,040
Not like that

1726
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,600
Even then he won't let
our family be in peace.

1727
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,480
When in power even the
illiterate can call the shots.

1728
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,640
So we literates must prove
what we are capable of!

1729
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,960
An educated person will
think but never act.

1730
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,840
I've made up my mind.

1731
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,640
I don't want anything to happen to you.

1732
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,800
Nothing will happen to me dad.

1733
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,360
Even his future generation shouldn't
think of doing what he did to me.

1734
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,560
I must either live a life
like you want me to or...

1735
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,720
I'll die fighting!

1736
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,880
Come on!
Don't speak so!

1737
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,320
Tell me what do you want from me?

1738
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:09,960
This is all I need dad.

1739
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,880
Chief, the nominations
have been submitted.

1740
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,800
So, tell me whom all you have to
meet, I'll make a list.

1741
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:16,240
Sounds good chief?

1742
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,000
Welcome media.

1743
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,960
What's the reason you
joined back in your party?

1744
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,160
Is it to hide your scams or to
prevent your current scams?

1745
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,920
Why enter into politics again?

1746
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,600
Good. Everyone is
talking about me.

1747
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:31,640
Thanks to one and all. I didn't
go in search of this post.

1748
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,160
It was the party who invited me.

1749
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,960
They invited me because they
want a genuine politician.

1750
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,160
Hold on dear.

1751
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,880
Do you believe you'll
win this election?

1752
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,480
There is no doubt in it.

1753
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,920
If you win, what minister
would you like to become?

1754
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,720
- Education minister for sure.
- Education minister?

1755
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:50,320
Of course. If a Tamizhan is not here then
other languages are getting into the region!

1756
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,160
Hence, I wish for that.

1757
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,160
In the high court it is proved that
his wealth is worth 680 million..

1758
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,040
Have this juice.

1759
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:00,680
But in this state, he has proved that his
wealth is only worth 12.6 million...

1760
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,520
...at the election commission.

1761
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,480
This shows us the true
face of the politicians.

1762
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,560
Swathi.

1763
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,560
Why are you crying?

1764
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,480
Nothing.

1765
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,480
Didn't you guys find
a place to meet?

1766
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,640
We can't drink or be loud here. Is
this where you decide to meet up?

1767
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,600
By the way what are you two doing
alone in the terrace at this hour?

1768
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:43,800
Thank you.

1769
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,120
What's the matter. Why
did you call everyone?

1770
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,640
Buddy!

1771
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,680
How are you?

1772
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,640
Is your dad out of town? Is that
why we all are meeting up here?

1773
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,800
Why didn't you come to
visit him in the hospital?

1774
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,040
Don't ask me.

1775
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,600
I got my mark sheet yesterday.

1776
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,440
And immediately my dad started
to pester me to find a job!

1777
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:02,400
I was running around the whole
day for a job that I didn't get.

1778
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,920
See, one day am away and
what happened to my friend.

1779
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,640
He is lying.

1780
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,520
So what's the serious discussion?

1781
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,240
Buddy.

1782
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,360
I've decided to lock
horns with Angannan.

1783
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,920
What?
You have decided it?

1784
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,200
Get lost!

1785
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:16,040
It was hell of a task to make your
mom that you fell of the bike.

1786
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,800
And now you want to lock
horns with Angannan?

1787
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,400
First let's try escaping away from him.

1788
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,960
Who wants to escape?
You or Jeeva?

1789
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,640
Clever answer.
Awesome.

1790
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,160
Do you think he
will let him in peace?

1791
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,760
Didn't he frame my father and
kill him in an accident?

1792
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,040
Swathi, we aren't saying
this out of fear...

1793
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,760
we are just saying why mess with
someone who has all powers?

1794
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,920
He is going to beat me bad, so at least
let me too throw some punches back.

1795
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,640
Think twice before
messing with him.

1796
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,800
Tell me that he will not
disturb me if I stay quiet...

1797
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,120
and I shall back out from this.

1798
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,720
A coward is the one who sits
idle when he knows he can.

1799
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,200
We can do this.

1800
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,360
It sounds scary,
no matter what.

1801
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,000
You guys ran away when they
murdered a stranger, fine.

1802
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,280
You guys haven't even gone
to that tea shop after that.

1803
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,560
Police, politician and thugs are
afraid of only one another.

1804
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,440
But us? We are afraid
all three of them!

1805
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,720
They are sidelining the students
knowing that students are the future.

1806
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,760
They don't care about us.

1807
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,280
Our fellow mates study here, work
abroad and send back the money here.

1808
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:11,040
But these fellows stay here, earn
here and send the money abroad?

1809
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,320
Yes correct! Buddy! Your
plan must be perfect!

1810
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,720
We are discussing some much but do you
think he will even think about us?

1811
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,480
This is nothing to him.

1812
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,360
I am dummy as far he is concerned.

1813
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,120
He thinks I am intimated by him.

1814
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,360
If not now then I will never
get a chance to put him down.

1815
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,680
When is so charged up...
why not give it a shot?

1816
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,880
You are the ruler, this
place belongs to you.

1817
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,960
Now show me what you got!

1818
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,920
It's your kingdom
and your rule...

1819
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,960
so get and do your stuff.

1820
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,640
So come one everybody,
give me a smile.

1821
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,640
Time to wear whites
and wage a battle.

1822
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,360
Only the courageous
one step forward.

1823
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,840
Make way dummies,
the boss is here.

1824
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,840
You are the ruler, this
place belongs to you.

1825
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,840
Now show me what you got!

1826
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,640
It's your kingdom
and your rule...

1827
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,920
It's your kingdom
and your rule...

1828
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:00,280
Oh my dear! Oh my dear!

1829
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,280
Who are you? Are you
from the outer space?

1830
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,280
Oh my dear! Oh my dear!

1831
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,600
Shall I pounce and
prey upon you softly?

1832
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,640
If I step on the
dias and perform...

1833
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,720
make sure you don't
let me get tired.

1834
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,880
And when my reign begins

1835
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,520
So let me while away
some time with you.

1836
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,760
The rain pours down
to mix with th soil...

1837
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,440
Love pours down to mix us
with among ourselves.

1838
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,360
Every cell phone needs
a service provider...

1839
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,280
just like life needs happiness.

1840
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,040
Ok my dear little thief...

1841
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,760
So come to me and...

1842
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,080
let me shower you with my love.

1843
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,120
His happiness comes
to an end from today.

1844
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,600
You are coming closer only after
I file the nomination. Isn't it?

1845
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:35,280
I wonder if you will turn up here
after you win and become the MP.

1846
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,360
MP?

1847
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,640
I'll become a minister!

1848
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,640
Then you won't turn
up here for sure.

1849
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,240
Whether I turn up or not...

1850
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,400
Already rumors about Ex
minister Pannai's wife...

1851
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,640
and me are doing rounds.

1852
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,160
If I come here again...
then that's it.

1853
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,960
Rumors will be confirmed.

1854
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,680
Why is your mood changing?
I'll definitely come.

1855
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,320
There is a lot to be done.

1856
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,720
Don't stand on the way.
Move! Move!

1857
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,200
The principal is here.
Move! Give him way!

1858
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,360
Sir, we've been waiting since morning!
Respond!

1859
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,760
Move!
The car is coming.

1860
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,280
What's up with the crowd?

1861
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,080
We got a letter saying that the
donation we paid is now being refunded.

1862
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,800
Move. Wait.
Lets talk.

1863
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,480
Move!
Give way!

1864
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,240
I said move!

1865
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,040
What rubbish is this?

1866
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,160
Who sent this to you?

1867
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,600
We never mailed it.

1868
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,080
We didn't even
collect donations.

1869
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,600
Students go back
to your classes.

1870
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,400
College has nothing to
do with this letter.

1871
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,720
Don't gather here.
Disperse.

1872
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,080
Don't gather here. Disperse.
Leave!

1873
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,640
They said in the email that only
today they will refund the money!

1874
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,280
Yes they did mail everyone and
now they refuse to accept it.

1875
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,080
We have the letter from them; we
won't let them go of that easy.

1876
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,880
Awesome buddy!

1877
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,520
We won't let this off so easy.

1878
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,960
There is at least one who
thinks like us in this crowd!

1879
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,720
Such big a crowd?
How many are there?

1880
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,240
Parents of 2 batches
of students.

1881
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,600
- At least 500 - 600.
- Yes

1882
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,800
What do we tell him?

1883
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,240
No one can talk to him.

1884
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,920
So, how are the party
works going on?

1885
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,120
It's going really well.

1886
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:56,800
Prabhu.

1887
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,760
- Is the party office ready?
- Yes.

1888
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,960
The ruling party will blow it out proportion
even if we just arrange 5 meeting points.

1889
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,040
We will handle it chief.

1890
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,560
Dear sister! You don't have to be
educated to get into politics!

1891
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,600
What do you mean?

1892
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,000
The waste fellows in
town, the useless ones,

1893
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,360
the beggars and
the snatchers....

1894
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,280
- Everyone are in politics.
- Not the time to play that!

1895
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,320
Change it right away!

1896
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,440
The battery is weak in the remote.

1897
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,160
The place looks familiar.

1898
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,040
Move!

1899
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,560
Looks like our college.

1900
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,080
What's with the language.
I can't understand it!

1901
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,560
Its in Hindi.

1902
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,440
Chief, listen to it carefully.
Its Telugu.

1903
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,520
I also have the same doubt.

1904
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,600
Where are you from sir?

1905
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:37,600
Why so much of crowd?

1906
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,040
Why are you here madam?

1907
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,720
Can't you play a
proper Tamizh channel?

1908
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,000
Why do you irritate me?!

1909
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,360
- You are now watching...
- There, play that channel.

1910
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,200
This is happening for the first
time ever in this world.

1911
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,240
This is a new beginning
to modern education.

1912
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,280
A small leap towards
a big revolution.

1913
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,000
Let's see what the
parents have to say.

1914
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,880
What are your thoughts on the refund
of the donation by the college?

1915
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,480
We make our children study
to reach greater heights.

1916
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,360
From the day we put them in
college, our tough time starts.

1917
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,120
This should put an end to all the
institution that demand money.

1918
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,760
Thank you sir.

1919
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,240
He doesn't pick up the call.

1920
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,720
Do you have the
inspector's number?

1921
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,880
- I know. Give the phone.
- Here. Dial it.

1922
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,480
They asked us to come and
collect the donation money.

1923
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,800
Here chief.
He is on the line.

1924
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,520
Hello.

1925
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,160
Yes chief.

1926
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,800
Who made promises
to refund money?

1927
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,440
Chase away everyone over there.

1928
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,400
Come on! It's not there are 5 people.
500 are here.

1929
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,160
They have proof in their hands.

1930
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,120
In fact we are here
to control the crowd.

1931
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,560
If we chase away then they will protest
on the road. It's become a bigger issue.

1932
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,120
Try to settle it
inside the campus.

1933
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:42,480
Who is it?

1934
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,600
Chief, it's me Angannan.

1935
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,880
Let's talk later.

1936
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,360
I just gave a statement yesterday.

1937
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,400
That if any college demands donation
then we will impose strict punishment.

1938
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,640
Look, one college has offered to
refund the donation today morning.

1939
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,240
I wonder who is the chairman.

1940
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,640
I called you to discuss
regarding that.

1941
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,760
Tell me what is it?

1942
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,440
- That's my college.
- What?!

1943
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,880
So you have more
wealth than me?!

1944
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,720
Why do you need this
unwanted publicity?

1945
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,080
Who told you to announce this?

1946
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,280
I didn't announce this.

1947
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,600
Do you think I'll ever
repay anyone's money?

1948
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,800
I don't care whether
you announced or not.

1949
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,440
Everyone's there with proof.

1950
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,640
If you refuse to pay then they
will go to the police station.

1951
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,480
Even the media has
started covering it.

1952
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,960
Tell me what do I do?

1953
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,200
Until the people supports us,
media can't do anything.

1954
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,400
If any investigation
comes up, I'll handle it.

1955
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,840
Pay them and then we shall
deal with the problems later.

1956
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,520
If you refuse to give then this
will spread like wild fire.

1957
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,160
So I must give them
their money back?

1958
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:35,520
Listen, refund the money and then
don't you know how to get it back?

1959
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,720
Collect those papers and
try to solve it quickly.

1960
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,400
He asks me to pay them off.

1961
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,760
It's not like its his money.

1962
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,880
Take the money and hand
it over at the college.

1963
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,560
Make it fast

1964
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,160
13 missed calls?

1965
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,200
It's him.

1966
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,280
Hello?

1967
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,560
And now you attend calls.

1968
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,520
No sir, I couldn't hear
it because of the crowd.

1969
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,240
First, refund them
all their money.

1970
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:57,120
But money?

1971
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,560
It'll arrive.
Refund them.

1972
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,120
Ok sir. Sure.
Thanks.

1973
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,120
Look, don't create any ruckus.

1974
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,760
They have agreed to
refund the money.

1975
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,640
All of you go to the B
block and collect it.

1976
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,480
They have got their money.
Let's ask their feedback.

1977
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,200
Tell me sir.

1978
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,600
We are very happy.

1979
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,920
I am very happy. This will
be very useful to us.

1980
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,560
- You?
- I'm very happy.

1981
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,760
This is an example.

1982
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,520
- I'm very happy.
- Super.

1983
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,920
Excuse me sir.

1984
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,720
Everyone seems happy but
why do you look dull?

1985
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,680
Only after this issue it came in the open
that our college collects donations.

1986
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,120
It is said that government pays up to
people to encourage them to study.

1987
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,160
But in private sectors, money is been
demanded for providing education.

1988
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,120
It's very sad.

1989
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,440
Oh I see!
So he did this!

1990
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,520
I'll be happy if every college refunds
the donation like our college did.

1991
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,000
Go mind your business!

1992
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,000
- Call from a new number.
- Attend it.

1993
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:54,880
Hello?

1994
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,760
Please hand the mobile to
the father of education.

1995
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,640
I appreciate the respect
you are giving him.

1996
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,160
- Who are you?
- Give him the phone you doofus!

1997
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,760
I should have give it the first time.
My bad. Here chief.

1998
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,800
Who could it be?

1999
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,640
Saw me in the TV?
I was looking smart right?

2000
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,800
Well done dear.

2001
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:12,120
Right now only you are sad.

2002
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,760
But do you know how many happy
faces just left this place?

2003
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,160
Parents of each and every
student are blessing-

2004
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,920
-you without even
knowing who you are.

2005
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,120
You must thank me for that.

2006
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,880
It can be arranged.
Anything else?

2007
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,800
Remember! I did this to
prove you what happens-

2008
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,080
-when you lock horns with
an educated person.

2009
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,760
Look here.

2010
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,040
It's not my job to change
you or the people for good.

2011
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,840
Just 2 things.

2012
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,160
#1. My certificate.

2013
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:38,840
#2. Return this college to the innocent and
genuine person from whom you snatched it.

2014
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,440
When a person is not ready to
give back your certificate...

2015
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,720
and do you think I'll return
the college that makes money?

2016
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,280
If you stop here then....

2017
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,760
no one will ever find out
about what I did now.

2018
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,080
If you don't stop.

2019
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,240
They I will reveal your
real face to the world.

2020
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,800
I thought you were just a
dummy but you talk too much.

2021
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,120
If I want I can have you
finished off right now!

2022
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,200
How long will you say the
same old cliched dialogue?

2023
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,080
I know how cheap you are and
what you are capable of.

2024
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,120
Do whatever you can.

2025
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,480
I'm ready to face it!

2026
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,520
Go bring them!

2027
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,920
Ok chief!

2028
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,200
Yeah fall down and die!

2029
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,640
You! So called henchmen!
Chief is calling you!

2030
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,880
Quick! Fast!

2031
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,880
Go knock his house down!

2032
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,720
Make him and his family
fear for their lives.

2033
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,160
- Ok chief.
- Make it fast.

2034
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:26,000
What's with the crowd
in front of his house?

2035
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,680
Park the car aside for a moment.

2036
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,000
Why is there a election booth
in front of his house?

2037
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,040
- I don't know.
- You oldie. Come here.

2038
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,200
All the work must
be done quickly.

2039
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,040
Ok.

2040
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,080
- Take care of him.
- Ok chief.

2041
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,840
Remember, do not miss
even a single voter.

2042
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,520
Is that Pugazhendi?

2043
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,160
He is already furious over us.

2044
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,240
How did he land exactly in
front of Jeeva's house?

2045
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,800
Could it be Jeeva's plan?

2046
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,080
I wonder what chief will
say when he hears this.

2047
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,880
What happened?

2048
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:56,800
Looks like he already had
a plan to counter us.

2049
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,480
Why?

2050
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,560
TN party has set up it's
booth in front of his house.

2051
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,120
If we go there it will turn into
an ugly spat. What do we do?

2052
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,120
Nothing!
Just return home.

2053
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,880
Chief, how about having
Biriyani on the way back?

2054
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:09,880
Look buddy,
they are here already

2055
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,320
Did you guys have your food?

2056
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:21,200
Why is your chief still
a bit cliche type?

2057
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,160
He very well knows what I want.

2058
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,600
I won't interfere anymore.
Do let him know if possible.

2059
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:27,680
Just stop obeying his words blindly.

2060
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,640
Ok?

2061
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,800
- Long live!
- Our chief!

2062
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,320
- Long live!
- Our chief!

2063
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,400
They have already set
up everything chief.

2064
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,800
I'll finish you off!

2065
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,960
- Long live!
- Pugazhendi!

2066
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,240
- Long live!
- Pugazhendi!

2067
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,360
- Long live!
- Pugazhendi!

2068
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,760
- Long live!
- Pugazhendi!

2069
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,720
Let's leave.

2070
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,000
- Long live!
- Pugazhendi!

2071
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,720
- Long live!
- Pugazhendi!

2072
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,200
Stop it! Don't just shout
because they are shouting.

2073
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,480
Go mind your business.

2074
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,880
- Long live!
- Pugazhendi!

2075
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,200
- Long live!
- Pugazhendi!

2076
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:59,360
The CM had ordered the colleges in
TN to avoid demanding donations.

2077
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,640
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

2078
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,880
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

2079
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:06,400
- Well done.
- Thank you.

2080
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:07,760
- Nice coverage.
- Thank you.

2081
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,760
- Well done.
- Thank you.

2082
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:12,720
Remember we will now
have more work to do.

2083
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,800
Sir, we are here
most of the day.

2084
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,240
Why don't we shift our station here?

2085
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,040
Shut up and follow me.

2086
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,920
Lift your heavy paunch
and follow me.

2087
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,040
Chief...

2088
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,040
- What do we do now?
- Ask me everything!

2089
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,160
That is why I told
you back then...

2090
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,520
...to put in behind the
prison for 6 months.

2091
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,080
You said he was a
dummy and let him go.

2092
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,760
Or else what?
Would you have arrested him?

2093
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,720
You guys are only worth
of eating and shitting!

2094
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,680
We must arrest him and
thrash him someday!

2095
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:46,800
What's the secret?

2096
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,800
Shut up!

2097
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,440
What's the plan now? Tell me.

2098
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,720
There are many unclaimed cases.

2099
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,400
Let's impose one out of
it on him and arrest him.

2100
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,480
Nod and I'll get it done!

2101
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,760
Are you nuts?

2102
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,200
If the case moves to court...

2103
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:00,280
his dad will come
and create issues.

2104
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,800
Instead why not finish
him off for good?

2105
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,040
Am I right?

2106
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,160
What about the girl?

2107
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:05,840
Which girl?

2108
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:09,200
That journalist who always
keeps roaming with him.

2109
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,880
Remember we threatened a guy at the
advocate's office? His daughter.

2110
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,360
Can't you finish a job properly?

2111
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,240
Did you spare her because
she is beautiful?

2112
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,760
- Finish her off too!
- Ok chief.

2113
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,440
Chief...

2114
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:18,480
I'll finish him for sure.

2115
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,840
What if your son questions me?

2116
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,400
I'll take care of that!

2117
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,680
First, finish him off!

2118
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,920
At least get this done properly.

2119
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,280
If you don't...

2120
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,040
then I'll replace you.

2121
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,200
Ok chief, I'll take care of it.

2122
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,120
Mr. Paunch! First hit the gym!

2123
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,360
Look at his paunch.

2124
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,440
Prabhu.

2125
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,600
Whatever you do; do
not leave any trails.

2126
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,920
No one must find out
that we did it.

2127
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:39,600
Ok chief.

2128
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,480
If possible finish them
both at the same time!

2129
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,440
Ok chief.

2130
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,480
Chief...

2131
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:50,000
Ever since we moved into this
house, nothing is working for us.

2132
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,520
Let's head back to our home.

2133
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,840
Even I feel the same.

2134
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,960
Jeeva...

2135
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,040
why are you dull?

2136
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,160
Buddy...

2137
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,280
it would be nice if our
plan works out soon.

2138
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,040
I don't know what he is up to next?
I'm still thinking.

2139
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,280
Go at this hour and
Jeeva will scold us!

2140
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,320
I'll handle him.
Come.

2141
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,520
- Well...
- Wait.

2142
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,680
what other find tough,
you got it easily.

2143
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,720
and what others thought is easy
has proven difficult for you.

2144
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,760
What do you mean?

2145
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,320
You love life.

2146
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,760
If two days his girlfriend
doesn't message him,

2147
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,720
then he gets worried that
she eloped with someone.

2148
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,520
But myself and Swathi
are not like that.

2149
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:27,280
I know she loves me.

2150
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,120
She also knows that I love her.

2151
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,560
She wants me to
confess it first.

2152
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,120
This feeling is
totally different.

2153
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,160
Dear sister in law, my brother's situation
won't allow him to sing a duet.

2154
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,280
- So you can have a "solo duet"
- Get lost.

2155
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:42,800
Hello?

2156
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,080
- Swathi...
- Yes sir?

2157
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,960
An important work has come up
Come immediately.

2158
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,520
- I'll be there in 15 mins.
- Don't be late as usual.

2159
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,360
Ok sir. Bye.

2160
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,680
He is having a nice time with
friends after long time.

2161
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:52,760
Let me go by myself.

2162
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,640
Rickshaw.

2163
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:57,960
- Where to?
- Anna Nagar.

2164
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:58,720
Ok.

2165
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,160
Yes Swathi?

2166
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,440
Someone's chasing me.

2167
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,800
What do you mean?
Where are you now?

2168
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,680
My boss called me up. He said he had received
a news about Anganna and asked me to come.

2169
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,600
I was on my way.

2170
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,800
Are you nuts?
Even we guys are staying indoors!

2171
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:22,680
- Why did you go alone?
- Forget that.

2172
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,800
They are chasing me.
What do I do?

2173
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,200
Don't get tensed. Which
area are you crossing?

2174
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,600
Kolathur.

2175
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,600
- Did you cross Kolathur petrol bunk?
- No idea.

2176
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,560
Oh! Come on!

2177
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:32,960
Grace Supermarket.

2178
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,640
Take the 1st left after that.

2179
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:36,200
Take left please.

2180
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,600
It's a dead end.

2181
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,080
Looks like that's a dead end.

2182
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,960
I know it's a dead end. Just ask
the rickshaw guy to take that left!

2183
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,920
Make it fast.

2184
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,160
We are looking for him and there he goes!
Knock him down!

2185
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,920
Hello Jeeva? Are you
there on the call?

2186
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:51,760
Tell me sir.

2187
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,560
I saw him. I'll finish him.
You finish her.

2188
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,680
We are following that girl.
We'll knock her down in a lonely place!

2189
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,080
They are getting closer.

2190
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,800
Don't be afraid. Just
get down and run!

2191
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:03,240
They look scary.
They will catch me easily.

2192
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,160
They are all hefty.
Its won't be easy for them to run.

2193
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,000
You keep running.

2194
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,960
Quick! Quick!
Catch her!

2195
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,480
Oh! Oh! It is a
four way junction.

2196
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,480
You two go this way
and you two that way.

2197
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,520
What about you?

2198
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,080
I'll catch her if
she comes this way.

2199
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:23,800
I can't run.
Let me do that job.

2200
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,640
Fine. I'll come too.
Let's look for her.

2201
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,000
Just run into any street.

2202
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,280
All the streets are very narrow.
Which one do I take?

2203
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,200
Make it fast!

2204
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,800
Where are you now?

2205
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,720
There are no dead ends there now. All
are narrow streets. Keep running.

2206
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,000
Sir, we are chasing him
and yet look at him...

2207
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,840
he is listening to songs
in his earphones.

2208
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,600
Why don't we press
charges on him for that?

2209
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,560
Charges?
Why not?!

2210
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:46,240
I said knock him down and
what are you talking about?

2211
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,600
Knock him down!
Now!

2212
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,400
Where did she go?

2213
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,480
She is irritating.
Come on!

2214
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,040
Are you running in
the narrow streets?

2215
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:57,400
Where are you now?

2216
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,440
I don't know.

2217
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,720
Check again!

2218
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:01,360
There is a temple.

2219
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,200
There is a narrow street past the temple.
Get into that.

2220
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,240
Did you get any water
bottle by chance?

2221
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,280
Are we here on a picnic?
Come on now!

2222
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,760
Such a small place yet it so big!

2223
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,280
She is just doesn't give up!

2224
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:27,720
They left right?

2225
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,960
You'll get caught if you become nervous.
Come to the street I told you.

2226
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,840
He has put the left indicator and I am
sure he'll turn right. You turn right.

2227
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:38,520
Stop staring!

2228
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,040
Can't catch him
instead stare at me!

2229
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,240
Now go!

2230
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,480
If any of you get hold of her.
Finish her off!

2231
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,040
I am stuck!
Help me! Help me!

2232
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,520
- Pull me carefully, dude
- Pull him out

2233
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,360
Hey Swathi! Hop on!

2234
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,000
But you only take your
mom and sis in your bike.

2235
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,800
- Is this important now?
- Hold on.

2236
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,480
She escaped away
from this street.

2237
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,200
Where are you guys?

2238
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,680
Just miss sir.
We'll catch her.

2239
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,120
He is going here with the girl.
Whom are you chasing?

2240
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,840
- Get in the vehicle.
- Start the vehicle!

2241
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,160
Fast! Fast! Fast!

2242
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,080
We can't face chief
if we let her go.

2243
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,080
Knock her down, the
moment you see her.

2244
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,520
You suck at driving!

2245
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,960
Wonder why I get such assistants?!

2246
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:38,760
There they are.
Knock them down!

2247
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:41,680
Knock them down!

2248
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,200
- Watch out!
- Hold on to me!

2249
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,600
Swathi...

2250
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,640
quietly.

2251
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,360
Where are you coming from?

2252
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,560
So sweet mommy.

2253
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,200
I asked where are
you coming from?

2254
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,760
I want to know what's going on.

2255
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,400
Aunty, when I was going
in the rickshaw...

2256
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,120
- You get in.
- You wait.

2257
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,200
Will you answer me or not?

2258
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,160
Well mom...

2259
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,920
Your friends usually
don't hang out here.

2260
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,000
But of late you guys meet here, in
the terrace and keep discussing.

2261
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,680
- Mom, dad's calling you.
- Wait!

2262
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,560
- You tell me.
- Ask dad what is it.

2263
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,840
You tell me what happened?

2264
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,200
- Dad will get upset.
- Lakshmi!

2265
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:35,640
See he is calling you.
Come in.

2266
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:37,120
Come on mom.
We'll discuss it later.

2267
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,440
Come in, I'll tell you.
Don't yell at him here.

2268
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,120
What happened?

2269
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,600
I told you to finish them,
instead you guys are hurt badly.

2270
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:48,880
Where are those three?

2271
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,320
Are they dead? Better
you all could've died.

2272
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,800
Is finishing of a guy and
girl such a huge task?

2273
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,640
Didn't I take care of
you all well enough?

2274
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,560
Indeed chief. Doctor sir, tell us if
these men will be of any use further?

2275
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,880
Should we keep
them or fire them?

2276
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,960
They are severely injured.

2277
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,360
What these guys are
civil engineers?

2278
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,720
We have done the necessary treatment.
They need at least 3 months rest.

2279
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,440
3 months? Just give them an injection and
perform a mercy killing on all of them!

2280
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,000
This is hospital.
We can't do that.

2281
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,000
- Where is the police officer?
- Chief, over there.

2282
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,160
Now, what happened to his legs?

2283
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,280
So you only lost your legs?
Why not your life?

2284
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,120
Put him into the
mortuary instead!

2285
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,640
Don't you come to
my house again!

2286
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,040
The doctors will say that you'll be fine.
Don't believe them.

2287
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,320
Just die! I won't be
attending your funeral!

2288
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,080
Which is why I am
visiting you in advance.

2289
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,840
Its election time and
this a hospital.

2290
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,440
Be careful, someone might take
your snap and make it viral.

2291
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:42,400
Both the police men
boasted off too much!

2292
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:45,440
Let my chief become the minister,
then I shall deal them.

2293
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,320
Sir, what deep
thoughts are you into?

2294
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,600
This is a silly issue.

2295
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,880
We are unnecessarily locking horns
with him and making him the hero here.

2296
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,200
Election is approaching.

2297
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,680
We have meetings, gathering
and party meets.

2298
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,200
Why think about him at this hour?

2299
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,880
Once you son returns, he
will take care of him.

2300
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,440
Or else let the election get over...

2301
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:09,000
I'll myself finish him off!

2302
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,600
Fine...

2303
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,320
Do the necessary preparation
for the election.

2304
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,320
Arrange the gathering
and I shall attend.

2305
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,720
What are you thinking?

2306
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,960
You guys judged our
love for each other.

2307
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,360
It was after telling you
guys about my love for-

2308
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,440
-her, I took her in my
bike for the first time.

2309
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,280
At the same time it felt
like the last time.

2310
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,960
I just wanted to save the education
system from the wrong hands.

2311
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,040
I had no other intention.

2312
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,680
But he went to the extent
of finishing me off.

2313
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,840
He sent his men to
finish of Swathi too.

2314
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:37,840
Then?

2315
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:40,600
For what she published on TV about
them what else will they do?

2316
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,440
Now, what do we do?

2317
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,080
Who's that?

2318
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,920
Why do you all look so scared?

2319
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:57,920
He first sent the thugs, then
the police and now you.

2320
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,440
He doesn't know that I am here.

2321
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:02,240
He is too furious on you.
That's why he sent the thugs and police.

2322
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,280
Do you have any idea
about his power?

2323
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,360
He owned 146 bars.

2324
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,760
When government took
over all the bars...

2325
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,080
he diverted his attention into
education and made business out of it.

2326
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:12,880
He owns 5 colleges
and 2 schools?

2327
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:15,000
In that, 1 college
is his son's name.

2328
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,320
Other's in are held by proxies.

2329
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:17,760
Our college is one of them.

2330
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:20,440
Forget about the income he gets
from the college and school.

2331
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:21,960
The whole world knows it.

2332
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,560
But there is something
no one knows.

2333
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:29,120
He has distributed 10,000 forms for non
existing courses in all 5 colleges.

2334
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,840
We know very well about our people.

2335
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,160
They blindly buy it without
even knowing what it is.

2336
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,480
They think they failed to get a seat
for the applied course and think...

2337
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:39,040
that someone with better
grades would have got it.

2338
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,480
That form is priced
at 800 bucks.

2339
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,400
I know all these details.

2340
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,720
But what's the use?

2341
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,680
He wants to finish you off but it's me who
told him to hold on till the election is over

2342
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:54,680
Use this time gap to you favor or else
he'll finish you and your family.

2343
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,480
- Just listen to me.
- What is it?

2344
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,720
You are tell his secrets to me.

2345
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,880
Then earn my trust and tell my
secrets to him. How can I trust you?

2346
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:03,440
Please leave.

2347
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,040
I knew you were
going to do this.

2348
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:06,520
I knew you had no plan with you.

2349
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,080
At least this senior has a plan.
Let hear it out.

2350
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:09,920
Plan?

2351
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:13,040
If I knew how to plan then why would
I be still a dummy candidate?

2352
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,960
Oh so you too don't
have any plan?

2353
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,560
So far, in my political career...

2354
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,720
the only thing I've earned is
the tag of honest politician.

2355
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,800
When I ask for post in the
party, they ask me money.

2356
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,920
But people like Angannan has money
and will now have power too.

2357
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,760
Don't think I am here to help you.

2358
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:28,840
- There is a little selfishness in this.
- There you go!

2359
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,480
If not this election then I'll
remain a dummy candidate forever.

2360
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,480
There is only one way I
could become the candidate.

2361
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,240
Only you can help me.

2362
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,040
Buddy...

2363
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,440
he is speaking the truth.
He is from my locality.

2364
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,480
Are you from Parandhamapuram?

2365
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,560
Yes dear.

2366
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:46,480
I'll let you know.

2367
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,360
- Greetings chief.
- Welcome.

2368
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,400
When did you reach? How
are things in our region?

2369
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,000
Everything is going on fine.

2370
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:58,200
Well, I've organized
a feast tomorrow.

2371
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:59,880
- Where?
- In our region.

2372
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,520
Do we really need this at
this hour of election?

2373
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,200
I guess he is expecting money.

2374
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,760
Don't worry.
No expenses at all.

2375
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:07,720
- Phew!
- Is it?

2376
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:08,640
I'll take care of it.

2377
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,120
Fine. I'll be there.

2378
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,200
Look at them
gobbling up the tea!

2379
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,080
- Hey!
- Hi.

2380
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,480
Maari, 2 tea.

2381
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,760
What's up Danny?

2382
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,640
What's with the beard?

2383
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,640
Is it some kind of
ritual offering?

2384
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:27,280
Stop it now.
He is already upset.

2385
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,840
I shall shave it tomorrow. Fine?

2386
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:29,800
Here you go.

2387
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,800
So this is where we are
executing the plan?

2388
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,640
Isn't this bit too much for him?

2389
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,120
Tomorrow is the real plan.

2390
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:42,000
Tonight we are just
going to sketch it out.

2391
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,000
It's risky to have done it tonight.
Our dummy candidate will get caught.

2392
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,200
- Hence, the arrangements for tonight.
- This fellow?

2393
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,320
Look at him. It's like he already
feels like the real candidate.

2394
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,960
Put a crown on his head,
he will feel like king.

2395
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,640
Buddy, tomorrow we must execute
the plan to perfection!

2396
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,520
Not us.

2397
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,080
We need someone else
to execute it for us.

2398
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,560
I need few of your
men tomorrow.

2399
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,480
Dude!

2400
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,320
Aren't we here for you?

2401
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,280
I want each and every one of
you by my side, when I win!

2402
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,520
That's the real victory.

2403
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:08,200
We shall execute it with people
from this locality. KG will do it.

2404
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:11,080
- Hey King Gopal!
- We'll handle it!

2405
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:13,360
Greetings brother.

2406
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,120
When is the dance
show happening?

2407
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,880
That's not here.

2408
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,720
It's over there.

2409
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,800
Hey you beauty! You are
look so ravishing!

2410
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,760
Come close to me and my heart
beat rises automatically.

2411
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,760
Hips like Shakira and
attitude like J Lo...

2412
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,720
her eyes are so beautiful, it
attracts the men automatically.

2413
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,680
Oh my dear, you are my weakness.

2414
01:44:57,720 --> 01:45:00,560
She made me crazy upon her.

2415
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:03,600
Her beauty knocks me down...

2416
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:06,600
I am you lover and
I'm gonna stalk you.

2417
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:21,320
Oh my baby, come to me.

2418
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,040
Don't you leave
me, you are mine.

2419
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,960
She kills me with her
looks and I fall for her.

2420
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,160
Who are you angel?
Please don't leave me ever.

2421
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,200
Oh my darling. Oh my love.

2422
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,120
Until yesterday I was a timid.

2423
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:14,080
Oh my doll, listen to me...

2424
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:17,080
today I am brave and ready
to challenge anyone.

2425
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,200
There are many who
do wrong here.

2426
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:23,040
But don't take me so lightly.

2427
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,280
The wrong ones are
playing boomerang...

2428
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,960
and they forget that it'll
come back to hit them.

2429
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:32,360
So don't you try to
kick the downtrodden,

2430
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,200
remember someday
you too might slip.

2431
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:38,120
So don't you
show off too much...

2432
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:40,840
someday you might be
at the receiving end.

2433
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:44,040
Oh my dear, you are my weakness.

2434
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,840
She made me crazy upon her.

2435
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,880
Her beauty knocks me down...

2436
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,560
I am you lover and
I'm gonna stalk you.

2437
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:55,600
Oh my baby, come to me.

2438
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,720
Don't you leave
me, you are mine.

2439
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:01,600
She kills me with her
looks and I fall for her.

2440
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:04,360
Who are you angel? Please
don't leave me ever.

2441
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,560
Oh my baby, come to me.

2442
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:10,560
Don't you leave
me, you are mine.

2443
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:13,560
She kills me with her
looks and I fall for her.

2444
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:16,960
Who are you angel? Please
don't leave me ever.

2445
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,920
Where are you off to so early?

2446
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:34,520
The feast is at noon.

2447
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,680
You better full your stomach there!

2448
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:38,760
Hey!

2449
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:40,880
What's going on?

2450
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:44,560
I wonder what is he up to?

2451
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,480
Hey, look there.

2452
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:52,640
Who gives you such ideas?

2453
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:56,320
I just left to buy snacks and here you
are with the liquor. What's happening?

2454
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:58,560
Run! Leave!
Go!

2455
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,880
I am really afraid of this plan.

2456
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:14,440
Don't you worry. We have
everything covered.

2457
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:15,440
What should I do?

2458
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:17,680
Just enjoy the show.

2459
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:18,840
Don't let anyone recognize.

2460
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,600
Like if I hide, won't
they still look for me?

2461
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:22,480
No matter what, I'll
be by your side.

2462
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:23,640
Won't you understand?

2463
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,560
- Greetings brother.
- Greetings.

2464
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,960
- Where is the feast?
- Over there.

2465
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,120
Is it non veg food?

2466
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:29,920
Come on.

2467
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:32,000
- Let me inquire.
- Just come.

2468
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,720
You said you don't have
anyone to create a ruckus.

2469
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,120
I think you got your man.

2470
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:38,320
Come on.

2471
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,560
It's already getting late.

2472
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,520
No idea.

2473
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,760
Shall we light the crackers?

2474
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,000
The chief will be here any minute.
Move!

2475
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:49,720
You pot head. I hope
everything is set over there.

2476
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,840
Everything is ready. If chief arrives and
gives a signal, they'll start serving.

2477
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:53,880
Long live Anguannan!

2478
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:55,400
Look it's our men.

2479
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:57,040
Check what is it.

2480
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:59,000
What's your problem?

2481
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,000
We need to meet chief.

2482
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,280
If hoists our flag then everyone
in our locality will vote for him.

2483
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,560
He is on his way for a meeting.

2484
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,280
- This is not the time.
- What's the issue?

2485
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,920
- Yes chief.
- What do they want?

2486
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,000
Victory is ours chief.

2487
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:09,920
Just tell me what is it.

2488
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,360
They were with you in the party.

2489
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,520
When you left, they also left.

2490
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,640
If you just recognize them by hoisting
their flag then we earn 40,000 votes.

2491
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:18,760
What do you want me to do?

2492
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:20,520
Don't think. Just go
and hoist the flag.

2493
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:23,200
Then go and conduct the feast.

2494
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,840
You start here, let me call the media.

2495
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:27,680
Long live Angannan!

2496
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,080
Why don't you guys spread all over?

2497
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,400
We aren't here to play soccer!

2498
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:34,320
Only if we stick together, we can
escape if the plan screws up.

2499
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,600
Stop talking and let's start the
arrangements to serve food.

2500
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,520
Excuse me!

2501
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,480
Manner less doofus!

2502
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:43,200
What's the hurry?
The feast hasn't started yet!

2503
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:44,400
The feast hasn't started yet!

2504
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:45,320
Get up! Move!

2505
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,120
He is my husband!

2506
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,680
The feast hasn't started yet!
Why is he here?

2507
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,320
Spineless fellow!

2508
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:50,800
I wonder how I ever
accepted to marry him.

2509
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:52,680
Food! Food! Food!

2510
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,640
Why is it getting late?
Food! Food! Food!

2511
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,520
The feast hasn't started yet!
Why are you asking me to get up?

2512
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,920
Move or he'll vomit on you.

2513
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,320
Eww! Come, let's leave!

2514
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,600
Fine! Let's leave.

2515
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:03,480
Let's handle the situation
until the chief arrives.

2516
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,680
What are you guys up to?

2517
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,960
How long have you been waiting?
When will they serve?

2518
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,280
Over that, these guys drink
and create a ruckus!

2519
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,360
This is atrocious.

2520
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,360
Do we look like fools to you.
When will you serve?

2521
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:16,080
Answer me! How long
should we wait?

2522
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:17,280
Meals...meals

2523
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,600
Come here.
Look what's going on!

2524
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,560
Come here. Answer us.
When will you serve us?

2525
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:30,360
Please hold on. Chief
is on his way.

2526
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:31,720
Come on please. Calm down.

2527
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:32,400
Hello?

2528
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:33,720
Has the chief started already?

2529
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,000
It's getting late here.

2530
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,360
Everything is going
on as expected.

2531
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:37,480
Everyone's waiting for him.

2532
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:38,840
Things are going as we expected.

2533
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:39,720
Ok.

2534
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,520
Has chief already started?

2535
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,880
Yes but it looks like he has some
personal work to take care first.

2536
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,040
He asked us not to wait. He
ordered to serve the food.

2537
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,920
- If chief has said it then let's begin.
- Yes, he did.

2538
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,320
So, shall we begin?

2539
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,600
Are you going to
serve water again?

2540
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:58,600
Go serve the food.

2541
01:50:58,640 --> 01:50:59,400
Ok.

2542
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,600
Make it fast.

2543
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,120
Why did you start
before chief's arrival?

2544
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:06,400
It is chief's order. He doesn't
want anyone to starve.

2545
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:08,800
- Oh! Then fine.
- Here. Serve everyone.

2546
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,720
Hey I need some gravy here.

2547
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,480
I asked gravy, who served rice?

2548
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,560
Now serve him some gravy
or he'll get upset.

2549
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:20,320
Can't you hear him
asking for gravy. Go!

2550
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,000
Why is there no meat at all?

2551
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,760
You must be finding it hard.
Here, let me feed you.

2552
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:27,960
Enough! Enough!

2553
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,440
Don't be hesitant. Eat well.

2554
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:35,640
If the media covers this then the
opponent party will be shocked!

2555
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:40,240
It looks like he has arranged
a grand welcome for you!

2556
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:44,760
Chief, it doesn't look as expected.
Not many are here.

2557
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:46,920
Oh! Oh!

2558
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,440
Greetings chief.

2559
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,280
- Greetings chief.
- Welcome chief.

2560
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Who are these fellows now?
Are they here to clean?

2561
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,840
You said the feast will
begin only after I signal.

2562
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,800
But here everyone's already
relishing the feast!

2563
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,360
- Even I don't get it.
- Indeed chief...

2564
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,720
look at them eat food
like starving dogs!

2565
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:03,080
You shouldn't sit with them!

2566
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,600
All of you stop
eating and come here!

2567
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,720
What happened? Why are
you calling everyone?

2568
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:08,640
Dude!

2569
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:11,960
This guy just called me in
fact all of us starving dogs!

2570
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:16,280
- What?! How dare he? All of you stop it!
- Come on now! Come here!

2571
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:16,960
What is it?

2572
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,480
- Do we look like starving dogs?
- Then? Aren't you?

2573
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,080
Ok, let's assume so.

2574
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,680
But only if vote for him
he'll become the minister!

2575
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:25,200
Isn't that why we are paying you
and feeding you with bribe?

2576
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,680
Sometimes you even
get paid double!

2577
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,280
We accept it because you pay us!

2578
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,520
Why are all of you silent?
Is that all?

2579
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,600
Had your food right? Go fight!

2580
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,720
You guys don't even
know how to vote!

2581
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:36,320
How dare you question me?

2582
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,520
Finish him off!

2583
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:38,720
We'll ourselves cast his vote.

2584
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,080
Then why are you here?

2585
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,440
How dare you talk to me like that?
Show some respect!

2586
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:43,840
Greetings minister sir.

2587
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,280
- How dare you mock at me?
- Move! How dare you!?

2588
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,960
Hey! Please don't
indulge in violence.

2589
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,240
So far it was an accident.
Now let me do it on purpose!

2590
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:51,800
Try if you have guts!

2591
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,120
I'll show you!

2592
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:54,360
Remove his loin cloth!

2593
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:57,040
He just pulled
of his loin cloth!

2594
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:59,440
Pad? or Bad?

2595
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,440
A three letter word, look
where it has got you.

2596
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,600
Sir, please give us an interview.

2597
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,920
Sir! Sir! Smile please!

2598
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,160
Sir, smile please!

2599
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,960
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

2600
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,160
Chief, I couldn't find your loin cloth.
This waste cloth is all I got.

2601
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:19,000
What's that smell?
Guess the chief was drunk.

2602
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,360
That too early in the morning?

2603
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:21,840
Ready sir?
Give the mike.

2604
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,200
Anganna who arrived
for the feast...

2605
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:27,920
behaved in rude manner with the
people and got attacked by them.

2606
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:29,440
It is said that he was drunk.

2607
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:32,720
This is a big insult to the party for which he
is the candidate and affects their chances.

2608
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,800
- The news has spread everywhere!
- Chief...

2609
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:35,640
Please wear this.

2610
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:38,600
You! Keep quiet now!

2611
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:40,920
Do you have any sense?

2612
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,880
I was being insulted there
in front so many people...

2613
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,480
and you guys were being
mute spectators!

2614
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,160
And now you want
me to wear this?

2615
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,400
Why do I need this now?

2616
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,840
What am I gonna do all
dressed up inside the house?

2617
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,320
What's going on?

2618
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:12,200
As I expect this issue to resolve...

2619
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:14,280
but it's blowing out of proportion.

2620
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,000
Do we really need this?

2621
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,400
In such cases, what we have to do...

2622
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:21,680
relies in the hands
of our enemy.

2623
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,080
- Greetings chief.
- Come

2624
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:26,240
- Greetings chief.
- Can't you be quiet for a while?

2625
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,640
What did I do?

2626
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,720
Like you don't know!

2627
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:32,320
Its all over the news!

2628
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,720
Look!

2629
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:34,680
Have a good look!

2630
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:38,600
A feast was organized
in Angannan's name.

2631
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,280
But...

2632
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:40,560
You were drunk and you
created a ruckus!

2633
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,480
I don't drink!

2634
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:43,720
Now, can we go and prove it now?

2635
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,760
We can't take a blood
test and go to media!

2636
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:49,320
Already there was another issue,
in which your name didn't come up!

2637
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,920
Somehow we solved it.

2638
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,640
But this one? You have
given them enough proof!

2639
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,480
Doesn't this happen usually?

2640
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:55,960
Once is fine

2641
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,560
But again and again is shocking!

2642
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:00,280
It's fine if it had happened any other day.
It's election time.

2643
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:03,080
If this had happened
after you had won then...

2644
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:05,800
we could have said the
opponents framed you.

2645
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:06,960
Similarly, two days ago...

2646
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,800
...you had created another problem
using your hence men and the police!

2647
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:11,720
Media wants to why police and
thugs met with an accident?

2648
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,440
You are very unpredictable!

2649
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:15,960
This won't work out.

2650
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:16,760
You better quit.

2651
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,320
For such a silly issue?

2652
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:20,120
Is this a silly issue?

2653
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:23,120
People remember the
latest happenings.

2654
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,320
That is why we lay road, provide
water etc during this time.

2655
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,560
I shall earn back my
respect where I lost it.

2656
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,360
By then election will get over.

2657
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:33,560
After that there no use doing that.
I shall give you one day time.

2658
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:37,600
All the media that wrote ill
about you must praise you.

2659
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,240
If you don't do it then I'll give
a statement saying:

2660
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:42,200
Due to breaking the rules
laid by the party...

2661
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:45,040
you have been fired as
the member of the party.

2662
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:46,640
What is your problem?

2663
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:48,880
Why do you keep having
problems over and again?

2664
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:49,960
Well, its nothing...

2665
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,560
A college student
is behind all this.

2666
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:55,240
Don't you have
better lame excuses?

2667
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:59,320
Even big shots here are afraid of you and
you say a college student did this to you?

2668
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:01,280
How did the media get involved?

2669
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:03,400
I was the one who invited them
when he hoisted the flag.

2670
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:05,160
Instead they got him
getting undressed.

2671
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:07,680
Forget what happened so far.
You have given me 1 day time.

2672
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:09,480
Let me set everything straight.

2673
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:11,160
You attend it!

2674
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,800
Fine. The get it done.

2675
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,240
- See you.
- Ok.

2676
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:18,720
Chief can you provide Z
class security for my chief?

2677
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:19,640
Get lost!

2678
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:24,720
Look at my plight! That guy has
allotted me one day's deadline!

2679
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:25,480
Now pour!

2680
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,560
Ok chief!

2681
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,720
Even I was in the party helping him,
he wouldn't have become the CM.

2682
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,360
Your son is here chief.

2683
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,400
How did he come to know?

2684
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:35,520
Get inside.

2685
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,320
Oh! Oh!

2686
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,440
That fellow is only worth one
blow and you let him go?

2687
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:50,800
Don't call yourself a politician!

2688
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:53,440
You were too bothered
about the election and...

2689
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:54,680
send me off on a trip!

2690
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:55,320
Now look!

2691
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:58,120
I thought he was a dummy!
How would I know he was so capable?

2692
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:00,320
Looks like he will send me
back to my struggling days!

2693
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:01,920
He has executed
everything perfectly.

2694
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:03,720
But he used a tool that
you don't possess.

2695
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,720
What is that?

2696
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:05,800
Brain!

2697
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:06,680
Oh! That one.

2698
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,360
He is indeed clever.

2699
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,960
Yet he has left a loop hole.

2700
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,680
Let me handle it.

2701
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:18,200
So you called him up?

2702
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:22,040
If I hadn't then the slap he
got would have been mine!

2703
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,040
Always on the mobile!

2704
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:24,800
Mom!

2705
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:26,840
Better get married to it!

2706
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:30,360
Where is dad?

2707
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,480
Got the printouts?

2708
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,160
Everything is going perfect.

2709
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,160
Make sure the guys don't
get wasted tonight.

2710
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:36,520
We must sure the
plan is a success.

2711
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,160
Come on. They won't risk it.

2712
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,640
Look, your dad.

2713
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:41,720
He must be here to notice me.

2714
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,480
- You leave.
- Ok.

2715
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,680
Brother...

2716
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,360
can you guide us to this address?

2717
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:48,200
Buddy, you tell them.

2718
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,920
Go straight and take a left.

2719
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,320
Daddy!

2720
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:26,840
You are everything to me.

2721
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:33,000
I am nothing without you.

2722
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:39,760
I am stranded and confused

2723
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:45,560
I am lost in tears.

2724
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:52,160
Mother carries a child inside her.

2725
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:58,480
But father carries the
mother along with the child.

2726
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:04,320
No matter how much sorrows
tries to attack a family

2727
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:10,680
the father sacrifices himself
to shield the family from it.

2728
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:45,960
This is a moment of self
realization in my life!

2729
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:58,960
I trouble you and make
your path difficult...

2730
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:04,160
I can see the pain
I've caused you.

2731
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:11,200
I wonder where do we go from here.
I hope everything resolves.

2732
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:16,560
Everything appears blank to me.

2733
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:29,360
As time changes, it changes everybody's
fate. I wonder what's next?

2734
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:35,320
Why are my loved ones
lying down hurt.

2735
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:39,160
My father and loved
have suffered enough!

2736
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:41,320
Buddy! How's your father doing?

2737
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:50,840
Attend the call.

2738
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,440
Attend it!

2739
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:55,720
Buddy, come let's find out.

2740
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:56,800
So...

2741
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,760
I heard someone threw
a bomb in your house?

2742
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,520
Please don't think it's me.

2743
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:01,960
TMS party and...

2744
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:03,880
TN party had a spat.

2745
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:07,000
Since your house is by their
booth, your family was affected.

2746
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,720
How is everybody?

2747
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:12,320
I heard everyone
is out of danger.

2748
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:14,680
Do you know what
affection means?

2749
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:16,480
Do you realize the
value of a family?

2750
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:19,320
Stop being emotional and don't
give me that family crap!

2751
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:21,720
Turn around. A doctor is
going into your dad's room.

2752
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:25,560
Stop! Don't rush. It's a cliche.

2753
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:30,760
Tell me, where should I come?

2754
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:33,320
Where I started
changing your fate!

2755
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:34,920
Come there.

2756
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:37,560
What is it?

2757
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,000
He wants me to come
alone to the college.

2758
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,800
To the college?

2759
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,200
You know, what he will do to you.

2760
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,600
Yet he wants to go.

2761
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:43,920
Refuse!

2762
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:45,600
Take care of mom and dad.

2763
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:48,440
- Hey Jeeva!
- Hey Jeeva!

2764
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:52,360
Either I must live a life
that you wanted me to have.

2765
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,560
Or else I'll die trying.

2766
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:54,400
Come on!

2767
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,840
I will always be your strength.
and never your weakness.

2768
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:09,480
My father and loved
have suffered enough!

2769
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,600
This is a moment of self
realization in my life!

2770
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:18,200
More than winning it's important
to win in front of your parents.

2771
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:22,440
Instead of sacrificing them and me
winning, I better sacrifice myself!

2772
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,160
Who are you looking for?

2773
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:36,160
Where is Kishore?

2774
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,960
How dare you say his name out loud?

2775
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:01,280
My dad...

2776
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:03,080
thinks he is a big shot.

2777
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:04,720
I am what I am because of him.

2778
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:07,080
But today he is what
he is because of me.

2779
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:11,640
I am going to beat you up
nice and slow until you die!

2780
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,720
Didn't I apologize to
you in the beginning.

2781
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:15,920
You will slap me in front of my wife!

2782
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:18,200
You will insult my dad in the public.

2783
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:20,320
You want me to overlook
that and forgive you?

2784
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:22,280
I thought of finishing
off your family...

2785
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:23,320
but they survived.

2786
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:25,760
Next, I'm gonna finish your dad or
else he'll go fight for justice.

2787
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:26,840
So...

2788
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,160
I hear you have a girl friend.

2789
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:29,840
He also has a sister.

2790
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:31,760
Stop staring!

2791
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:35,840
Tell me.

2792
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:38,360
I've captured him.
Come, finish him off!

2793
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:41,520
Don't finish him before I reach there.
I want to kill him myself!

2794
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:55,040
Watch me finish him off!

2795
02:04:55,800 --> 02:05:00,360
Chief, once any gets caught in your
son's net, then it's the end of them.

2796
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:04,960
He is busting up my son!

2797
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,200
Go thrash him!

2798
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:09,800
- You too! Go thrash him!
- Ok chief.

2799
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,880
How dare you raise hands
on my chief's son?

2800
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:13,760
How dare you mess with us?

2801
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:16,000
Save me chief!

2802
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,720
For me, my family comes first.

2803
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:26,840
How dare your son threaten
to finish off my family?

2804
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,560
What do you know
about education?

2805
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,920
Do you have any idea how much
people struggle to pay the fee?

2806
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:31,960
How would you know?

2807
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,240
You only know to collect fee.

2808
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:34,880
Anyone can do any business.

2809
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:36,640
But studies must always be
controlled by the government.

2810
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:38,400
If it falls in the hands
of people like you...

2811
02:05:38,440 --> 02:05:41,680
Then the education loses its value and
so does the ones getting educated.

2812
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,680
The moment government takes
control over education...

2813
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:45,480
only then our nation
will prosper.

2814
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,400
Until then...

2815
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:52,560
I've all evidences against you.

2816
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,800
I will punish you.

2817
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:54,760
Go!

2818
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:57,120
You can't even cross
this premises.

2819
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:58,760
You will never change!

2820
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:02,520
Jeeva!

2821
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:07,680
What' all this?

2822
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:11,400
Come on.

2823
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:13,920
What's all this?

2824
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:15,320
What's going on?

2825
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:16,560
Nothing dad.

2826
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:20,320
You!

2827
02:06:20,440 --> 02:06:24,520
You can even raise a son properly
and you want to run a college?

2828
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:27,920
There is no use in giving your initial
to your children and then not minding them.

2829
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:30,880
Everything else is tagged as
mother tongue, mother land etc.

2830
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,600
Do you know the reason why a father's
initial is given to the children?

2831
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:35,800
The father can make or break
the fate of his children.

2832
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:37,240
You aren't genuine.

2833
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:39,160
That is why your son is like this.

2834
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:41,040
You must change.

2835
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:43,440
He will automatically learn.

2836
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:47,960
Come let's go.

2837
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:52,400
Kishore!

2838
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,520
Please don't shoot me! No!

2839
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:00,920
Sir! Sir! I always knew that...

2840
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:03,040
This will happen to the people
who criticize the God

2841
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:05,360
I knew it. Sorry sir.
Please don't shoot me.

2842
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:13,160
This is all I get for working
all these days. Sorry chief.

2843
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:14,880
Thank you sir.
See you sir.

2844
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,280
What are you wondering?

2845
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,280
Their death is not in the hands
of people outside their circle.

2846
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:23,800
It'll be in the hands of people
like us who are with them.

2847
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,120
If these guys have to change
just by your words then...

2848
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:28,160
they should have changed when
their parents would've told them.

2849
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:30,040
These guys will never change.

2850
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:33,560
After you leave, they will get up
and set their henchmen after you.

2851
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:34,760
That's why I killed them both.

2852
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,400
Do you know where we fail?

2853
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:39,360
We wait until we have an issue
and that's where we fail.

2854
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:41,920
You were provoked only when
your conduct was declared bad.

2855
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:43,920
When the education system
is in such hands...

2856
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:47,040
and if we still don't revolt,
then we all are bad!

2857
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:51,600
Past: Unity revived 'Freedom'
Present: Integrity retrieved 'Bull sport'

2858
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:54,600
Future: Ensure farming, education, medicines
Now: Wick of education is lit, what next?
