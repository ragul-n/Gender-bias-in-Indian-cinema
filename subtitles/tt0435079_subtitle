1
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:40,776
Watchman, peon, is anyone at home?

2
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:46,081
Of course there is! I am all
in one and the cook too.

3
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:49,283
I am Professor Laxmi of
Kasturba girl's college.

4
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,218
Oh! Welcome, Madam.

5
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,016
My name is Totaram Sakharam Jadhav.

6
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,160
I received an official intimation
regarding your arrival.

7
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,020
This is Sister Sophiya and
all these are my girls.

8
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,300
What? You have that many girls
at such a young age?

9
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,374
- They all are my students!
- Sorry! Hello everyone!

10
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,035
- Where are our rooms?
- This is the living room...

11
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,508
and there are two rooms
on either side.

12
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,913
There is a small room attached,
I shall set it up for you.

13
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,779
Come, have a look.

14
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,515
Please come.

15
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,865
This is the room for the girls,
your room is that way, please come.

16
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,733
This is your room, isn't it nice?

17
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:46,067
Alright. Tell me,
does any man live in this place?

18
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,940
If you consider me a man then
only I live here and nobody else!

19
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:57,220
No man or woman ventures here,
all you'll get to see is my face!

20
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,359
You talk too much,
go and make coffee for us.

21
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,836
Its quite a peaceful place!

22
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,706
Why has professor Laxmi got us here?
Agreed that its a beautiful place...

23
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:28,046
but there isn't any newspaper, T.V.
Programme or even anyone to look at!

24
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,987
Besides us, there is no
living being around this place!

25
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,293
Hey look, there is greenery around!

26
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,970
How did these girls come here?

27
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,207
Haven't you'll ever
seen girls before?

28
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,486
You'll have forgotten your march
because of these girls!

29
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,694
Totaram, didn't I ask you
if any man lived in this place?

30
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:29,101
How does that matter, Madam?
This rest house isn't owned by me!

31
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,906
They came with an official letter,
that's why I had to put them in.

32
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,776
Tell them that there are girls living
here, they should go somewhere else.

33
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,922
And what if he says that men will
stay here, women can go somewhere else?

34
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,252
Do as I say, go!

35
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,920
But Madam, I a weak man and
they all are young and well built...

36
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,729
if you go yourself, you can show your
power and create an impact too!

37
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,734
A woman?!

38
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:07,007
How did you come here, mister?
Only women can live in this place.

39
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:11,940
- Is this a home for women?
- Listen to me!

40
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,554
I am professor Laxmi of
Kasturba girls college.

41
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:22,358
I am retired Major, M.K. Das
of National college.

42
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,157
Madam, you are disturbing us.

43
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:40,240
Madam, I am talking to you,
didn't you hear me?

44
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:50,847
Madam, I am a bachelor,
I don't talk to women!

45
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:55,116
Girls live here,
you'll shift from this place!

46
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,463
My students have come here
for a botanical research.

47
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,996
And we will live here for one week!

48
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,997
You are purposely staying here
to harass us!

49
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,136
I hate women!

50
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,076
A woman is the cause of
all destruction!

51
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,872
And a man is a cheat, a fraud!

52
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:21,145
Don't forget, Adam, the first living
being on this earth was a man!

53
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,754
And he was conned
by a woman called Eve!

54
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,885
I want to know whether you
will leave this place or not?

55
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:10,195
- How did you come in?
- Open the door, I say!

56
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,262
- You go out.
- No, you go out first!

57
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,337
- What are you doing in my room?
- And what are you doing in my room?

58
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,610
This is my sari!

59
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,290
How can we live here,
if this continues?

60
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,162
Yes, we will leave immediately!

61
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:51,367
We can't live in presence of this
mad professor & those hooligan boys!

62
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,964
You'll are unnecessarily
wasting my time.

63
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,640
I shall abide to whatever decision
that is taken after the investigation.

64
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,173
Don't try to pressurize me,
you can go now!

65
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:11,318
- Greetings, sir.
- Hello!

66
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,185
- He is a Government officer,
Mr. Ratan Lal. - Please sit.

67
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,464
I am the Chairman of a committee.

68
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,666
There is a ruin here and people
believe that its an ancient temple.

69
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:31,007
But the landlord of this place claims
that it is his personal property.

70
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,404
Now that you are here, all problems
will be solved. Sir, I...

71
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:42,743
Totaram has told me everything. But
that guest house is a public place...

72
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,884
and there is no such law that
only women can live there.

73
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:52,030
If you arrange for our stay somewhere
else, we'll be highly obliged.

74
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,357
He can work wonders!

75
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,698
- Alright, I'll do it. - If he
said it then he'll surely do it!

76
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:07,576
- Where? - At Thakur Omkar Singh's
place, his old bungalow is vacant.

77
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:13,912
You go and meet him. Totaram,
tell Thakur that I've sent them.

78
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,180
He can never disregard
your recommendation.

79
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:31,665
- Yes, sir? - How are the girls?
- They are very beautiful, sir.

80
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:41,473
You can say that they have the
beauty of all the states in India.

81
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:46,748
They nine of them and
each one is stunning!

82
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,618
- I will stay here for few days.
- I am aware of that.

83
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,758
As soon as I get the chance,
I'll present one of them to you.

84
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,619
What is the matter,
why is everyone so quiet today?

85
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:01,095
That's because the professor
is in his room.

86
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:05,367
Its nice that they are quiet or else,
they would have troubled us!

87
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,906
- What would they do?
- They would tease us...

88
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,635
and would try to get
friendly with us.

89
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,375
We aren't scared of them,
we can set them right!

90
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:22,110
Forget it, you will be the first one
to invite that guy in spectacles!

91
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,452
With your presence,
this place looks wonderful!

92
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:32,996
Alright, I would but wouldn't you
also say the same to that fair guy?

93
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,930
And what if professor Laxmi
lands up when they are here?

94
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,196
Let her come, who cares about her?

95
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,541
- Pack your bags. - Why?
- We are leaving this place.

96
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,813
The landlord's bungalow is vacant,
we will live there.

97
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:54,482
- But we're enjoying here. - How can
we in presence of those audacious boys?

98
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,546
We'll go and get the permission
to stay there, come on.

99
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:12,098
- What is it? - Those girls...
- Girls?

100
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:17,973
- The girls and the professor in the
neighboring room. - Are they dead?

101
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,710
No sir, they are
leaving the guest house.

102
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:29,045
But uncle, it is not good that
they are leaving because of us!

103
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,465
Sir, we live together
and if we adjust a bit then...

104
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,458
Adjustment with women, never!

105
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:49,204
Sir, not for women,
just for the sake of humanity.

106
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:56,609
This feeling of humanity will ruin
you! Loving a woman is inviting death!

107
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,415
I've heard that you sing sometimes.

108
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:11,025
- But till we are here, you will
not sing! - But why, sir?

109
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,098
Don't you know children, animals,
snakes, get drawn towards music?

110
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,633
But sir, there aren't any children,
animals or snakes here.

111
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,569
You fool, there are 10 snakes
in that room, beware of them!

112
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,647
You are right but Thakur does not
permit anyone to live here.

113
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:37,248
Right but the government officer
has sent a special recommendation...

114
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,984
that these people...
- Totaram, don't you know...

115
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,659
that since Thakur's elder brother
has been murdered...

116
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,332
forget staying, he doesn't even
let anyone get close to this place!

117
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:52,266
And because of this grief, he wants
to sell his property & settle abroad.

118
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,472
Please excuse me!

119
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:03,147
- Yes, I am the Manager speaking.
- This is our senior master.

120
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,348
Our junior master
is a very nice man.

121
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,954
If you speak to him personally,
he will surely arrange for your stay.

122
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,962
- Who are you'll? - Sir, Government
officer Ratan Lal has sent them here.

123
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,299
- Yes, tell me.
- I am professor Laxmi.

124
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,696
I am living in the guest house
with few of my girl students.

125
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,703
Some boys are staying there and
due to them, we are very harassed.

126
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:32,037
If you arrange for our stay
somewhere else then...

127
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,507
Your face looks familiar,
is your name Sophiya?

128
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,649
- Aren't you late Thomas's daughter?
- Yes, did you know him?

129
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,516
Yes, he was my elder brother's
property manager in the city.

130
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,724
- Make arrangements for their stay
in the quarters outside. - Okay, sir.

131
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,326
Thank you very much.

132
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,329
Thank you, sir.
We will take your leave now.

133
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,333
They all will come here
with their baggage.

134
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,140
Totaram, take the keys from the peon
and get the rooms cleaned.

135
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,875
It was nice that Thakur recognized
you or we wouldn't get a place to stay.

136
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:15,078
Sister, you did not tell me that
your father was a manager here.

137
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,756
Even I learnt today that Thakur had
property in this place too.

138
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:29,095
2 years back, I heard that my father
committed suicide by jumping in a river.

139
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,240
I don't feel like staying
at the Thakur's place.

140
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,370
- Sister, you want to live
in the Thakur's bungalow? - Yes, why?

141
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:46,773
- Don't you know that spirits
and ghosts live there? - What?

142
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,112
Yes, and that ghost
has killed many people.

143
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:50,853
You shouldn't fall in danger.

144
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,125
So what do you say, Mr. Thomas?

145
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,400
The same as before!

146
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,674
So, you won't tell me the location
of my brother's hidden treasure?

147
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,876
- Never! - Sir, please stop!

148
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:25,822
Thomas, if he wanted,
he could have killed you long back.

149
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,359
He kept you alive so that you tell
him the whereabouts of the treasure.

150
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:35,296
He is a generous man, he'll surely
give you some share from the treasure.

151
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:39,635
Why will he be generous towards me
if can kill his own brother for wealth?

152
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,969
Thomas, don't be a fool,
if you value your life...

153
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:53,913
then tell him the location
of the treasure. - I will tell.

154
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:00,381
Two years back, when the senior
Thakur bought this property...

155
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:06,191
and the excavation work began,
ruins of an ancient temple was found.

156
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,199
Along with the gold
idols of the Gods...

157
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,198
treasure worth millions
of rupees was found!

158
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,666
Yes, tell me more about the treasure.

159
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:22,206
You mete out injustice on
your brother and seized the idols!

160
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,748
And you even killed him to know
the location of the treasure!

161
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:30,149
Thakur, God will never forgive you!

162
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,481
I will deal with God, you tell me
the location of the treasure.

163
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,759
Do you think I will tell you?

164
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,757
Thakur, a true Christian will die...

165
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:44,361
but will never hand over the property
of the villagers to a vile man like you!

166
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:52,838
Mr. Thomas, tell me one thing, do you
want to meet your daughter, Sophiya?

167
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,446
Where is my daughter?

168
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,654
She has come here
with some college girls.

169
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:08,982
Tell me the truth,
has she really come here?

170
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:13,390
I am telling the truth, you can
meet her, I can get her here.

171
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,066
I want to see her, Manager.

172
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,541
- Then I can die peacefully!
- Only Thakur can decide your death!

173
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,615
But I'll arrange for something
by which you'll be able to see her.

174
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,556
- After that...
- Lets go, Manager.

175
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:56,697
We have a request to make, please
don't leave this place because of us.

176
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,774
So, your scheme is that the girls &
boys should live together as comrades?

177
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,449
Lts not a scheme but since you said
it then listen to the rule of nature...

178
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,117
the way fiber cannot be
separated from cotton...

179
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,455
body cannot be separated from soul,
hair cannot be separated from skin...

180
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,726
similarly, a male cannot be
separated from a female.

181
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,262
Their union is the destination
of love and peace!

182
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,459
You can keep your destination
to yourself.

183
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,798
We can solve that problem later but
the purpose we have come here now...

184
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,670
is that if you have to go due to us
then we have no right to live!

185
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,273
It would be better that
we leave this place instead.

186
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,813
Girls, you'll can stay here,
we will leave this place.

187
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,812
Goodbye! Farewell, adios!

188
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,619
- What nonsense is this? - Please
don't mind, we are leaving from here.

189
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:53,356
We would have no problems if
you'll would leave this place!

190
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:59,831
But what will the world say if you'll
go away due to our personal problems?

191
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,839
That's why we make an appeal,
let us all live together!

192
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,177
Why are you stuck at the same point?

193
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,643
We have decided that
we will leave this place.

194
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,774
- Does that mean that our requests
have no effect on you? - No!

195
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,911
We need to be lucky
to have an effect on them...

196
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:23,652
for that we need to pray 'O Lord,
let good sense prevail on them...

197
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,663
so that they can stay with us.
- Amen!

198
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,691
Girls, carry your bags in.

199
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,228
Aren't we leaving, Miss?

200
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,924
'Where are you going? '

201
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,475
Oh! The old man!

202
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,624
Come in, quickly!

203
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,971
Who is it?
Oh, it's you, Sir!

204
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:48,652
Aren't you ashamed?
Doesn't this effect my reputation?

205
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,330
Sir, when did you arrive?

206
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:08,166
Have you come here to sing & dance
with girls or for botanical research?

207
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:12,901
Sir, we didn't do any research.
We weren't singing and dancing.

208
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,480
Don't bluff! What is your intention
of getting friendly with them?

209
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:20,017
- There is no intention, sir.
- I understand everything!

210
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:26,882
But remember, if you do it this
again then you'll have to repent.

211
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,265
Stay within your limits!

212
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:27,748
- See a butterfly! - Have you come
here to study butterflies?

213
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,616
Don't you even dare look at the
butterflies beyond this line!

214
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:47,364
- Go back! - Madam,
look at that thorny shrub.

215
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:52,765
Study the shrubs here,
don't look side!

216
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:43,821
Look ahead!

217
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,233
Oh, you?

218
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,243
- Yes, tell me.
- I have got a good news for you.

219
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,980
- Your father is alive!
- What, is my father alive?

220
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,923
- Where is he? - After he
murdered senior Thakur...

221
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,721
he is absconding
with the fear of police.

222
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:20,924
Murder? My father
can never kill anyone.

223
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:26,001
- Please let me meet him once!
- I will as soon as I get the chance.

224
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,538
But don't tell this to anyone
or else he may get caught.

225
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,334
I will not tell anyone.

226
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,609
- Will you ferry us across? - No,
my ferry is not in working condition.

227
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,217
Is it a motor that
it has a flat tyre?

228
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,616
It has a problem and will break
apart if it carries any weight.

229
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,765
Why, won't it capsize
with their weight?

230
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,700
They had paid the fare in advance.

231
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,170
- Then why did you lie?
- I think something is fishy.

232
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:06,441
- Come, lets check out!
- Hey! You cannot go in.

233
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,508
Don't you dare talk
like that with us!

234
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,048
- Hey, stop!
- Where are you running?

235
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:37,847
- Tell us the truth, who are you'll?
- We are the village musicians.

236
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,118
Don't lie or we shall
hand you over to the police.

237
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,462
- Tell us or... - Yes, come on!
- Okay, I will tell you.

238
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,131
We were going...

239
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,533
It looks like an idol
of some ancient temple.

240
00:37:55,973 --> 00:38:00,672
You are right, police has seized
a similar idol once before.

241
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:08,212
There is a big demand of such idols
among the tourists & the rich people.

242
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,284
That's why so many thefts take place
in temples and museums these days.

243
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:16,482
And it is clear from the pictures
we found with these idols that...

244
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,820
some smuggler gang
is operating here.

245
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:23,690
- It is possible. - Our informer
could get in trouble.

246
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,698
The man who saved you'll from trouble
cannot be in a mess himself.

247
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:34,839
She worked here for 4 years, I can't
believe that she could do this!

248
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,913
It could also be possible that
someone lured her into doing this.

249
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,514
And she had no idea
what she was carrying.

250
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,589
You'll can go.

251
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,987
Thakur, do you suspect anyone?

252
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,192
No inspector, they have been
working with me since many years.

253
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:03,866
I have utmost faith in them.
But what could this matter be?

254
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,877
We will be able to say for
sure only after the inquiry.

255
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:12,271
But one thing is for sure, a gang
of smugglers is thriving in this area.

256
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:16,216
And this gang has some connection
with your maid's murder.

257
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:23,220
- I take your leave. - Approach me
if you need any help in this case.

258
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,746
Don't go there or the ghosts
will finish us off!

259
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:55,256
I am not scared of ghosts.
Lets go in and check.

260
00:39:55,793 --> 00:40:03,928
No! Do you know, the ghost of the
late landlord comes & kills everybody!

261
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:08,400
Your name is Bahadhur Singh(brave)
& you speak like a coward!

262
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,473
Everyone values life! Many villagers
have been victimized by him.

263
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,577
- Its a full moon night, he'll
surely come out. - And we'll nab him!

264
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,339
Arrest a ghost that
too without a warrant?!

265
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:24,811
Please go ahead, do the good deed
win the reward & call yourself brave.

266
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:28,948
- I'll guard that post.
- I'll do my duty here.

267
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,790
Be careful, the ghost might
do his duty instead!

268
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,182
Help!!

269
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:16,401
- What happened? - Ghost! He killed
him and... - Where did he go? - There.

270
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,835
We will have to go to the root of
this matter. There is no ghost.

271
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,278
There are ghosts!
I saw it with my own eyes.

272
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:31,055
- Why didn't you follow it?
- Who would come and give you...

273
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,182
the report?
- Bahadur Singh, you are a coward.

274
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,358
From now on you will
patrol with us.

275
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,861
- Totaram, we came first, serve us
first. - I have no idea who...

276
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,193
came first. My job is to cook and
serve and I have done that.

277
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:48,429
Don't touch it! Are we your slaves
to eat your leftovers?

278
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:55,042
- No you are our Queens! - Leave it!
- No, we won't!

279
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:05,712
Tell them not be under the illusion
that they have ousted us!

280
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:12,226
Lts the rule of nature,
the woman always loses.

281
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,060
Please make her quiet, she is
shedding tears before the nuptials!

282
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:21,227
These are tears of indignation on
your impudence, not of sorrow.

283
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:25,397
You parade yourself as civilized men
and throw yourself on food like dogs!

284
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:32,905
What do you think of yourself, we
can oust you in seconds!

285
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:36,753
- Bets? - Yes!
- Are you sure? - We are sure!

286
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:48,095
- What is it?
- Uncle, there is a chance...

287
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:54,961
to uphold your ideals.
- Uphold my ideals? What do you mean?!

288
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:59,504
These girls think they
are invincible.

289
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:06,443
- They have challenged they will
oust us - Not just that, they were...

290
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:07,948
saying that you are
a stinking old...

291
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,584
They said many such things, I don't
have the face to tell you all that.

292
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,787
They are out to insult all of us.

293
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,795
I am not a novice.

294
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,289
Suppress the woman as soon
as she raises her voice!

295
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:28,001
- Do we have your permission?
- Go ahead!

296
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:47,736
Get away! You don't deserve to
be called my students.

297
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:54,481
I have seen everything,
you've put me to shame!

298
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:59,279
Go, pack up, we are leaving
tomorrow, early morning!

299
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,630
- You'll play very well.
- Thank you.

300
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:19,967
- I enjoy watching girls & boys
playing together - Is it?

301
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:25,308
And this game was amazing!
Your style & tactics were remarkable!

302
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:30,142
You should display your skills
in the Olympics.

303
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:34,381
She would like to do so but she
hasn't got the opportunity.

304
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,391
- Sir can give you that opportunity.
- Yes, why not?

305
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:43,795
- Your name? - I am Lata & she is
Saroj. - That's a beautiful name.

306
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:49,462
You too have a good name. Why don't
you come over to my bungalow some day?

307
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,265
I love playing Ping Pong.

308
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:56,003
Why don't you go to China to
satisfy your hobby?

309
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:59,013
The people there love
playing Ping Pong.

310
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:20,531
What's up?!

311
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,203
Take a look!

312
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:16,464
- We did a good job!
- Lets get out of the disguise.

313
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,007
Come on, soil your clothes.

314
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:36,416
Lets go to sleep now, we'll
report to the police in the morning.

315
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,218
You?!
What happened to you?!

316
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,425
We saw some tribals jumping
out of the window.

317
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:54,900
We smelt something fishy and
we attacked them.

318
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,363
- Does this belong to you?
- Yes, they are ours.

319
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:03,042
Those tribals looted
them away.

320
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:07,547
- We put up a tough fight with them.
Can I get a glass of water? - Sure.

321
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:13,386
One of those tribals gave such
a punch that he saw stars in the day!

322
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:16,058
Please get some water for me too.

323
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,059
You'll put yourself in such a
lot of trouble for us!

324
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,057
So what, it was our duty.

325
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:26,733
Rajesh, just check if
I have broken my bone.

326
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,565
I think you've slipped
your bone.

327
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,572
Go to the doctor and get
an X-ray tomorrow morning.

328
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:38,574
- We will be in the train
tomorrow morning. - Why?!

329
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:46,211
The professor is very wild because
we lost the game yesterday.

330
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,091
His orders are that we will
have to leave this place tomorrow.

331
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:53,225
And you too want us to leave
this place, don't you?

332
00:53:53,797 --> 00:54:00,430
- Its not so. - In that case,
if you go to the professor...

333
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:03,333
and tell him about our bravery, he
might be pleased & will let us stay.

334
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,767
We will also complete our
research in that case.

335
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:09,776
Why should we have a problem in
saying that. Its all true.

336
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:18,777
But promise me, you won't
trouble my student's in future.

337
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,116
We will never trouble them!

338
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:24,961
Girls, go tell the professor.

339
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,149
Come in!

340
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,819
Did you recognize me?

341
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,221
Sir, you and in this guise?!

342
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:59,086
I too can do what you can do!

343
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:05,824
But I would never frighten girls by
entering their room at night in guise.

344
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:12,669
We did this to hide our defeat and
prove our bravery.

345
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,836
If you had such a scheme
why didn't you consult me?

346
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:21,842
- We were scared. - You are never
otherwise scared of me.

347
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:26,179
If you would have consulted me, I
would have given you a better solution

348
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:30,520
We did what we thought best
at that moment.

349
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:34,185
- Anyway, we will go away tomorrow.
- Who said we are going away?

350
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,030
Do you want to put me
to absolute shame?

351
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:42,034
You want them to say the men
scooted off in fear of defeat?

352
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,537
- Which means we aren't going?
- Yes, the trip is canceled.

353
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:58,350
- Down with Thakur Omkar Singh!
Lets move ahead! - Stop!

354
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:02,884
If you violate the law,
you will all be arrested.

355
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:08,561
This has been Lord Krishna's temple
for ages. No one can stop us!

356
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:12,891
An officer has been sent
here for inquiry.

357
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,368
You can't get in until he doesn't
give his verdict.

358
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:20,004
We aren't breaking any laws, we are
going in to worship the Lord.

359
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:25,307
- We can shed our blood for this!
- Back out, the results will be bad!

360
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:28,908
Stop!

361
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:34,518
- What is the matter?
- You'll are students.

362
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:38,249
- This subject is not included in
your course. - It undoubtedly is.

363
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:44,256
We are the citizens of this country
& we can revolt.

364
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:48,104
- What's the matter?
- This is Lord Krishna's temple.

365
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:53,606
Thakur smuggled the idols
and seized the temple.

366
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:59,108
- Why? - Idols worth lakhs are
buried in the temple grounds.

367
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:03,274
The Thakur bribes all the officers
who come here for inquiry.

368
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:07,355
Why didn't you place this matter in
front of the renowned men of the place?

369
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:10,793
We tried but who listens to us?

370
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,293
Your voice will surely be heard.

371
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:17,356
Nobody can suppress the voice
of the public!

372
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:37,292
Rajesh, she froze with fear at our
sight! Come on, give her a hand!

373
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,330
- We've come at such an opportune
moment! - Who are you?

374
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:50,001
We are students. We had gone to meet
the officer, we heard he is here.

375
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:53,444
We thought lets take this
opportunity to meet you too.

376
01:00:54,217 --> 01:01:00,349
You invited him, you could have
invited us too, we too are new here.

377
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:06,188
Why will he call us? We haven't
come here to inquire about the temple.

378
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:09,854
- What can I do for you?
- We have a request.

379
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:14,025
File your report about the temple
with honesty.

380
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:20,202
Who are you to advice me, I will
write what I think is right.

381
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:26,878
But obviously, after all you
are a simple honest officer

382
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:32,043
You haven't come here to quench
you thirst or take a bribe.

383
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:36,624
Shut up!
I take your leave, Thakur.

384
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,459
Please don't render
Lord Krishna homeless.

385
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,332
- With whose permission did you come
here? - We never take any permission!

386
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,065
We are short tempered, so we request
you to hand over the land...

387
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:55,904
of the temple to the public
without bloodshed.

388
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:59,570
I don't need your advice
in this matter.

389
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:07,315
If you give me some whisky I
too can shout like you.

390
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:10,251
That we are not afraid of anybody!

391
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,260
- What are you up to?
- We won't let you rest in peace...

392
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,662
until the temple land is not
handed over to the public!

393
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:23,928
- Get lost! You loafers!
- We won't leave you!

394
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,109
- What are you up to? You are
educated men... - Yes, we are.

395
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,939
- Why complicate matters?
- Who is complicating matters?

396
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,615
Tell him, he will not have his way.

397
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:45,624
According to me,
your students...

398
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,958
shouldn't interfere in the
matters of the temple.

399
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:56,966
Students should be involved in all
the matters of the country.

400
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:01,974
- I don't think so.
- I think so. Aren't you aware...

401
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:05,306
of the extent to which smuggling and
bribery is rampant in our country.

402
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,318
To put an end to it,
youngsters...

403
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,987
must come out
and take the initiative.

404
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,322
You are talking about
politics now.

405
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:19,320
On the one hand you call for
student help in politics...

406
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:22,794
to fulfill your selfish ends...

407
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:27,731
and when they try to do some
good work without your consent...

408
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:31,803
you say students shouldn't
interfere in politics!

409
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:36,004
You have come here for a few days,
you shouldn't mess in local matters.

410
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,807
Doesn't this region come
under the Indian nation?

411
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,349
Is it wrong to raise ones voice
against injustice?

412
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,818
You want me ask my students
to choose a wrong path?

413
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,520
I will never do that!

414
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:55,292
Lts the duty of the youth to raise
their voice against injustice.

415
01:03:55,531 --> 01:04:01,026
But if your students violate the law,
then the result shall not be good.

416
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:03,568
Don't threaten me, Mister.

417
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:09,972
The law that comes in the way of
good deeds can also be modified.

418
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,267
- What is the matter?
- Tell us, what happened?

419
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:49,140
- Ghost!! - Where is it?
- Tell us! - There!

420
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,304
- What happened?
- A thorn pricked me!

421
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,777
- Where did he vanish?
- We cannot see clearly in the dark.

422
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:31,051
If this ghost is real then...
Ghost!!

423
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,323
You?! Where did you disappear
the other day?

424
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:40,458
- Forget that, what are you'll doing
here? - We're following the ghost.

425
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,728
- Why do you want to get
into danger? - Ask them!

426
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,997
Go back and sleep!

427
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,937
I hope he isn't the ghost!

428
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:09,688
Don't address me so formally,
I am just an ordinary servant.

429
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:13,827
Mr. Totaram, you perhaps
aren't aware of your position.

430
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:18,838
- You can do a lot! - Alright,
tell me what I can do for you?

431
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:22,505
Please reach this letter
to Miss Leela.

432
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:26,837
- Please give this to my Saroj.
- And give this to my Lata!

433
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:32,919
- And for whom is this? - For you,
consider it as a postage!

434
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,062
What's the matter, why hasn't
Totaram got the breakfast?

435
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:43,862
- Totaram, get the breakfast
quickly! - Getting it!

436
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,880
Totaram, give us also,
we are waiting since a long time.

437
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,952
I am getting toast, butter
and boiled eggs for you.

438
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,090
- No, get the same for us.
- Alright.

439
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:12,421
- Then you can take this, Miss.
- No! I mean, you eat this...

440
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,564
- I'll get it for you in a jiffy!
- I'll eat that.

441
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,425
- No, wait!
- Why are you so hassled, Totaram?

442
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,236
What's this?

443
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,896
What, a piece of paper?

444
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:31,438
'Since I've seen you,
I've gone crazy...

445
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,908
you aren't aware
how much I love you! '

446
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:38,981
'Meet me in the evening,
yours always.'

447
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:43,920
What nonsense is this, Totaram?
Tell me, who gave you this letter?

448
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:51,323
Well, the baker might have baked it
along with the bread!

449
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,132
Tell me the truth or I shall
have you removed from your job!

450
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:59,000
I swear, I don't know, it could be
that when I was making the omelettes...

451
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,268
those boys must have
hidden this letter on sly.

452
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:06,811
Come with me!

453
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:16,684
Sir, professor Laxmi
has given this...

454
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,295
- This letter is for me?
- Yes.

455
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:32,303
'Since I've seen you,
I've gone crazy...

456
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:38,638
'You aren't aware how much I love...
O God, please save me!

457
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,710
'Meet me alone in the evening.'

458
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:47,322
'Meet me alone! '
Where is this woman?

459
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:52,187
You are a lady professor
and is this your character?

460
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,059
How dare you fall in love with me!

461
01:08:56,365 --> 01:09:00,461
- How can I love an idiot like you?
- What, I am an idiot?

462
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:05,805
First you write a love letter
and now, when you see my anger...

463
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,741
you deny it! - This letter is
written by your students.

464
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,213
My students wrote it to me
on your behalf?

465
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,546
No, they wrote it
to my girl students!

466
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:21,356
- They hid it under the toast!
- What? - Yes!

467
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,355
This is a new experiment with love!

468
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,964
You should punish them
for this impudence!

469
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:34,091
- Or else, they'll... - That's why,
I request you to move out.

470
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:39,097
- You are defending the boys! - No,
It concerns the safety of the girls.

471
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:41,041
Butter will melt
with the warmth around!

472
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:44,106
Then why don't you carry your
butter cartons and move out!

473
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:46,376
Why don't you move out
with your fire flies?

474
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:49,443
Is this the way you shape up
the character of the youth?

475
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:53,244
Are these the students who will
lead this country to progress?

476
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,920
My students are not the only ones
who'll shape the future of the country!

477
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:01,796
If the girls try to use their
charm to lure the boys...

478
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:03,124
then what can they do?

479
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,396
That means you are trying to
cover up their flaws?

480
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:10,205
No, I am trying to
open up your mind!

481
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,137
O Lord Krishna...

482
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:20,144
did my students have to follow
only this quality of yours?

483
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,545
- Are you upset with me?
- I was never pleased with you!

484
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:29,622
To err is human besides, I did not
know that the letter would be found.

485
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:33,751
I am glad it was found or
you would write a book on love!

486
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,092
My heart is conveying the love
that the books cannot!

487
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:42,433
Every beat of my heart says only
one thing, Leela! Will you hear?

488
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,839
You can tell professor Laxmi
to listen to your heart beats.

489
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:56,708
This tree is called 'Love tree'!

490
01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:00,649
- You can collect as many samples you
wish. - Don't give me explanation...

491
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,917
I will do it myself!
- Alright, do it!

492
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:10,325
I want to tell you that not only the
leaves, its branches also convey love!

493
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:15,799
- Is that so? - Yes Lata,
I am walking on a new path now.

494
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:20,340
- This path is called 'Love road'!
- Hey, you! What nonsense is this?

495
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,133
This is no nonsense, Madam.

496
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:28,340
We were discussing adjustment
in human relationships.

497
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:33,814
If you trouble my girls again then
I shall report it to the police.

498
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,021
- Lata, come with me.
- Okay, take her away!

499
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:47,358
Have you all taken the samples of
different trees and shrubs?

500
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:49,897
Have you'll made notes on them?

501
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:56,911
- What is it? - An old woman and
her daughters wish to meet you.

502
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,978
Meet me?! I do not know anyone here!

503
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,582
Child, you will know me
only after you meet me.

504
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:07,852
Our car broke down, the driver has
gone to town to replace the parts...

505
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,722
its quite late in the night and
the roads are also very lonely...

506
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,656
besides, I have
three young girls with me.

507
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,056
Some gentleman outside
told them of this place...

508
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,925
but there is no place for them here!

509
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,658
You shut up! Child, one should
have place in their heart...

510
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,336
let us stay here one night,
we shall go away in the morning.

511
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:28,407
- I don't mind but... - Don't
worry, its a matter of one night...

512
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:32,604
they all will sleep together.
- Alright.

513
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,810
See to it that this lady and her
daughters don't have any problems.

514
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,283
- Goodnight! - Live long, child.
May you prosper!

515
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:47,953
We have no problems now. Why are
you'll standing here, mix with them!

516
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:51,095
What is your name?

517
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:56,570
And what is your name? I am
sure we will get along very well!

518
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:02,370
- I like you a lot.
- If that is so then marry her.

519
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:06,482
If I was a boy I would
surely get married to her.

520
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:10,578
I think I like this girl!

521
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:16,387
- I am like your daughter, aunty.
- Yes, why not?

522
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,583
My daughters are just like me!

523
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:22,263
Aunty, your this daughter is
very mischievous!

524
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:26,867
Why, what did she do?
Don't bite your nails!

525
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:32,405
Why do you do the same thing
always? Sometimes she kisses me too!

526
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,474
Please don't feel bad!

527
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:38,613
Lts quite late,
I think we should sleep now.

528
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:42,617
That's exactly why we are here!
Come, lets get ready to sleep.

529
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:47,679
- Do you'll want to change? - No,
we aren't going to sleep for long.

530
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,620
Why should we waste time
in changing clothes?

531
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,624
You'll can go and change.

532
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:08,301
Please open this zipper!

533
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,180
You don't take the trouble,
I'll do it!

534
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:23,188
- Are you'll real sister?
- Why, do you doubt it?

535
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:25,792
No, I asked because there is no
resemblance between you three!

536
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:29,521
- Its not our fault.
- Mother, did you hear that?

537
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,598
She says that we don't
resemble each other.

538
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:35,530
Child, how can they
be blamed for that?

539
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:40,471
We live in a joint family, this fat
one looks like her elder uncle...

540
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,536
this tall one resembles
her tall uncle...

541
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:47,011
and this short one
resembles my husband.

542
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:53,750
You don't mind what they say, they
have grown up but haven't yet matured!

543
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,014
That means none of them are married?

544
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:00,228
Child, I have turned old before
time worrying about them.

545
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:04,694
I really wish I find
good boys for them.

546
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:10,561
I really like this girl! I'll
have to find a good boy her too!

547
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,842
- I like her!
- You are very naughty!

548
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:19,672
Who has come?

549
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,149
Silence please!!

550
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:28,486
We could not help it,
we were helpless in love.

551
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:46,173
What are you doing at this hour,
alone in the room of a bachelor?

552
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:48,839
I had to come here to inform you
about the activities of your students.

553
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,917
- What have they done? - They have
crossed the limits of impudence!

554
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:55,318
They dressed up as women and
entered into the girls room!

555
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,851
You are laughing? This is not
a joke, they have misbehaved!

556
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:04,055
Listen carefully, if you don't
take any action against them...

557
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:05,529
then I'll report this matter
to the police!

558
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,534
Madam, you are threatening me.

559
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:12,996
Don't forget I am retired
army officer, Major. M.K. Das.

560
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:16,474
So what, I can also
give you a befitting reply!

561
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:23,882
Does it mean, you'll dress your girls
in boys clothes and sent them there?

562
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:27,020
- Don't speak rubbish!
- Mind your language!

563
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:34,021
You've come here alone in the night,
on the pretext of complaining?

564
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:38,028
Madam, I very well understand
the purpose of your visit.

565
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:42,695
I'll deal with you later!

566
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:06,722
- You?! - You can meet your
father today. - Really? Where?

567
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:10,189
Today, there is a special mass
in the church, you come there.

568
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:16,132
But nobody should know about it
or his life may get in danger.

569
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:18,804
Don't worry, I will not tell anyone.

570
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,388
You can see your daughter...

571
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:19,190
but if you act smart,
I'll shoot you!

572
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:24,596
- Where is my father? - Bad luck,
I could not unite you'll!

573
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,324
The inspector landed up there,
I was scared he would see him there?

574
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:29,335
You really care a lot for my father.

575
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:35,140
I am just doing my duty, I'll be
glad if I can unite you both.

576
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:37,744
I'll inform you again as soon as
I get the opportunity.

577
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,612
Now you go,
someone may recognize us.

578
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:48,948
The report sent by the officer
appointed by the police...

579
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:50,751
is against your claims!

580
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,226
This sure is a ploy against us!

581
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:57,890
Please be silent.
Inspector, can I see the report?

582
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:04,035
It states that 'there is no proof
of a temple existing on this land.'

583
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:08,908
'Lts found from the late Thakur's
documents that he owned this land.'

584
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:10,369
'And this is what I also believe.'

585
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:11,841
This is lie!

586
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,306
We all know that the officer has
accepted bribe to make this report!

587
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,247
- We will not accept this decision!
- We will seize the temple!

588
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:25,453
Silence! If you want to
object to this decision...

589
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:29,256
you can appeal in the court. Its the
police's duty to follow these orders.

590
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:33,599
But inspector, the order is
against the wishes of the public...

591
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,134
you may follow it but
we will not abide by it.

592
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:39,930
You are instigating
them against the law!

593
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:43,937
To support this cause,
we shall awaken our conscience!

594
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:46,746
- Let us go ahead! - Stop!

595
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:53,277
Inspector, don't you
dare touch my students!

596
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,220
You stop your students...

597
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:58,890
they want to seize the Thakur's
land along with these villagers.

598
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:03,156
My students will not do any such
work that is against the truth.

599
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:08,434
- But the officer's report...
- I know that officer very well!

600
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,297
That means you will not
stop your students?

601
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:16,777
Never! But you can surely stop
this feeling of unrest amongst them!

602
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:20,036
- What does that mean? - I'll meet
the Collector of this place...

603
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:26,447
and few other people, I request
that until I don't give my report...

604
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:28,982
you don't impose
your decision on these people.

605
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,923
Alright, I agree to this.

606
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,339
Snake!!

607
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:19,030
- The snake has gone!
- Its alright, you do your work!

608
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:32,380
Boys, didn't you'll hear,
the snake has gone.

609
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:44,587
- Did you get scared? - Yes!

610
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,931
This was just a snake,
what if a lion would come here?

611
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:54,269
- Are you offended?
- Why should I feel offended?

612
01:26:57,712 --> 01:27:00,476
One thing is sure, because of
these boys, the snake went away.

613
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:06,745
True! I feel a man shouldn't suppress
a woman & treat her as a slave.

614
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:13,227
Right, with the changing times, we
men should also change our attitude!

615
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:20,826
- So soon! - How come
the whistle blew so soon?

616
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:24,660
- It burst! - What burst, sir?
- Your head!

617
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:32,742
You'll can also go into your rooms.

618
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:43,817
What is the matter,
where were you lost?

619
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:48,159
No, I was not lost!

620
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:53,766
- Did you injure yourself?
- Not on my head!

621
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:03,043
- Can I come in?
- Inspector, please come in.

622
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:06,644
Good that you've come,
I was going to come to meet you.

623
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:08,379
Please sit.

624
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:12,451
Why didn't you allow
my men on my land?

625
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,788
The officer has already
presented his report.

626
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:18,247
More than your land, its
important to maintain peace here!

627
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:22,795
- And I am responsible for it.
- You are misusing your position.

628
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:25,055
I shall complain against you
to the superintendent of police.

629
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:31,933
Please go ahead, but you aren't
giving me a chance to talk.

630
01:33:32,907 --> 01:33:35,603
- What is the matter?
- Your maid was murdered.

631
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:40,006
She was found with few idols
from the temple and also a letter.

632
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:43,681
- How am I connected with this?
- You could be!

633
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:48,088
- I don't know anything about this.
- But the police knows a lot!

634
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:51,491
Don't try to threaten me!
You can leave!

635
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:56,819
I am leaving but until the inquiry of
your maid's murder is not complete...

636
01:33:56,998 --> 01:33:58,829
you cannot leave this place.

637
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:52,142
Its such a serious situation,
three murders in four days!

638
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:56,889
Thakur's maid, a policeman
and now, an inspector!

639
01:34:57,124 --> 01:35:00,821
Sir, the maid was not killed
by the ghost, she was shot!

640
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,691
All this indicates
some deadly conspiracy!

641
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:07,290
This ghost is a brain work
of some smuggler gang.

642
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:12,165
I've decided that I will
surely capture this gang!

643
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:20,496
Lord Krishna, you have finally
bestowed your mercy on your devotee!

644
01:36:24,545 --> 01:36:28,504
- Come in. - Did you call for me?
- Yes, I called you.

645
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:33,981
- Its late, why haven't you slept
yet? - The whole world is sleeping...

646
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:37,318
but today, my eyes
are devoid of sleep!

647
01:36:37,491 --> 01:36:40,517
- Are you feeling alright, sir?
- Yes, I am fine!

648
01:36:42,096 --> 01:36:47,659
The weather is very beautiful today.

649
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:53,467
It is same as before, sir.

650
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:59,679
No my child, don't you feel as
though nature is by someone's side?

651
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:05,016
I cannot sense anything
like that, sir.

652
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:09,485
Open your eyes and see,
listen clearly...

653
01:37:12,193 --> 01:37:15,026
Iook at those trees...

654
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:19,030
as though the breeze
is gently swaying them!

655
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,371
As though they have bathed in the
moonlight and look extremely serene!

656
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:30,903
Sir, you sound very different today.
What is the matter?

657
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:36,777
Yes child, there is something
and I've actually changed.

658
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:42,444
Everything has changed. I feel as
though bubbles are bursting within me.

659
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:46,717
There are sparkles around me and
I can hear music in my ears.

660
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:48,389
Sir, what is wrong with you?

661
01:37:48,562 --> 01:37:55,934
Rajesh, you are an artist,
a singer, please sing for me.

662
01:37:56,570 --> 01:38:00,734
I will not sing, you are aware that
there are 10 snakes in the next room!

663
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:04,611
Rajesh, snakes are
worshiped in our country.

664
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:06,746
They will also enjoy your song.

665
01:38:07,248 --> 01:38:10,615
Come, I order you
to sing in the moonlight!

666
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:54,030
Hey! Where is Saroj?

667
01:41:54,408 --> 01:42:00,040
- Hey, everyone wake up!
- What happened? - Where is Saroj?

668
01:42:08,021 --> 01:42:10,581
Why have you got me here?
Where is Baldev?

669
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:12,859
You wait here, he'll come soon!

670
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,401
Please don't worry,
we will take care.

671
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:34,541
You three go and search
every corner of this area.

672
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,815
Baldev, Totaram was not
in the bungalow.

673
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:44,958
Let Totaram go to hell!
Lets look for Saroj first.

674
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:51,222
- But where? - You go towards the
guest house and you go there...

675
01:42:51,532 --> 01:42:53,363
and I'll go and lodge a report
in the police station.

676
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:13,647
- You?! What are you doing?
- Don't get scared.

677
01:43:14,888 --> 01:43:16,719
Your Baldev is in front of you.

678
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:20,790
You rogue! You have deceived me
and called me here?

679
01:43:20,961 --> 01:43:23,395
Don't speak loudly, I want to make
arrangements to send you abroad.

680
01:43:23,564 --> 01:43:24,724
Don't you dare touch me!

681
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:14,779
I am warning you,
don't come forward!

682
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:22,187
Why are you after me, leave me!

683
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:10,021
Hit him... hit him more!

684
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,974
You scoundrel, swine, how dare you!

685
01:46:40,827 --> 01:46:43,728
Today we will bash up that Totaram!

686
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:48,932
Come, hit me!

687
01:46:50,303 --> 01:46:56,264
- What nonsense is this? - Come
and hit me, take away my life!

688
01:46:57,711 --> 01:47:02,080
- What are you doing?
- Kill me!

689
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:06,084
Totaram, its nice that
you admitted your fault...

690
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:07,544
we have forgiven you!

691
01:47:07,721 --> 01:47:11,623
No, don't do that,
I want to atone for my sins!

692
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:17,829
If that's what you want then pick up
all these shoes and polish them!

693
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:22,628
And if you ever repeat this again
then we all will thrash you.

694
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:26,165
Go, polish the shoes soon!

695
01:47:31,011 --> 01:47:35,107
At the moment, Professor Das and
Laxmi are lost in thoughts...

696
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:38,979
we'll never get this opportunity
again! - What does that mean?

697
01:47:39,219 --> 01:47:44,452
I mean, come here,
why are you feeling shy?

698
01:47:45,892 --> 01:47:48,656
Lata, don't feel shy, come with me.

699
01:47:48,962 --> 01:47:54,730
- Where? - There, I want to discuss
an important matter with you.

700
01:48:02,175 --> 01:48:07,670
You saved me from disgrace,
I will never forget this favour!

701
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:12,482
Forget about favors and
talk about this moment.

702
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:16,022
Can't we be life partners?

703
01:48:16,723 --> 01:48:20,022
- Men cannot be trusted.
- Don't say that, Leela.

704
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:24,761
We lived together for so many days and
I tried my best to get close to you.

705
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:27,893
And yet you don't trust me?

706
01:48:28,535 --> 01:48:34,496
I do trust you but after we leave
from here, you will not remember me.

707
01:48:35,742 --> 01:48:44,912
Don't degrade a beautiful emotion
of love by talking like that!

708
01:48:45,151 --> 01:48:46,118
No, I didn't mean that!

709
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:54,590
Friends, this is a Government order,
after reinvestigating the matter...

710
01:48:55,295 --> 01:48:59,732
the Collector had decided that
this temple of Lord Krishna...

711
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:03,666
and also the land shall be handed
over to the village committee.

712
01:49:04,504 --> 01:49:07,268
Long live the professor!
Praised be the Lord!

713
01:49:09,242 --> 01:49:11,733
There is one more information
regarding this matter.

714
01:49:12,646 --> 01:49:16,673
In the charge of sending a false
report and one more issue...

715
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:19,819
officer Ratan Lal has been
sacked from his duty!

716
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:24,019
Down with Ratan Lal!

717
01:49:24,324 --> 01:49:29,956
This is the victory of truth,
honesty and unity!

718
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:33,761
We are strong if we are united.

719
01:49:34,668 --> 01:49:41,767
The way you'll have ended
bribery and dishonesty, similarly...

720
01:49:42,475 --> 01:49:47,845
if the students and the masses unite
& wipe the evil of the society...

721
01:49:48,882 --> 01:49:51,180
then it will be the greatest
service towards our country.

722
01:49:52,218 --> 01:49:55,187
Your students and you
have shown us this path.

723
01:49:56,423 --> 01:50:02,191
One doesn't need to attend any class
for the wisdom I've given my students.

724
01:50:03,897 --> 01:50:11,531
All I have to say that if the
students all over the world unite...

725
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:18,802
and end the evils of bribery and
dishonesty then we'll surely progress!

726
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:32,356
I am saying the truth, he has
been dismissed from his job.

727
01:50:33,393 --> 01:50:38,228
How can that be possible?
You do one thing...

728
01:50:38,865 --> 01:50:43,825
make some arrangements that the
villagers don't enter the temple today.

729
01:50:44,738 --> 01:50:45,762
- Did you understand?
- Yes.

730
01:50:49,676 --> 01:50:51,166
Tomorrow your daughter
will leave from here.

731
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:57,780
But you promised that
you will take me to her.

732
01:50:57,951 --> 01:51:00,852
If you listen to me then I can
surely fulfill that promise.

733
01:51:03,023 --> 01:51:05,253
The treasure will
decay under the soil...

734
01:51:05,892 --> 01:51:07,860
if it is found then it can
be put to good use.

735
01:51:08,428 --> 01:51:13,661
I will give my life but I cannot
give the village property to you'll.

736
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:16,664
Does it mean you don't wish
to meet your daughter?

737
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:19,934
I am yearning to meet her!

738
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:24,405
If you tell us the location of the
treasure, we'll help you to meet her.

739
01:51:25,378 --> 01:51:27,403
Otherwise, she will meet
the same fate like you!

740
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:32,882
No Thakur, I plead to you, please
don't mete out any injustice on her!

741
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:36,885
Then listen to him, you can write to
your daughter and ask her to meet you.

742
01:51:37,457 --> 01:51:39,015
Then you can tell us
the location of the treasure.

743
01:52:02,749 --> 01:52:05,513
We have come to this
place from very far...

744
01:52:05,685 --> 01:52:08,518
and have spent few days
together in seclusion.

745
01:52:08,755 --> 01:52:15,718
When I think back, I find it very
amusing that we wanted to part ways!

746
01:52:16,696 --> 01:52:20,996
We all fought a lot and with those
fights, arose the feeling of love.

747
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:24,601
Now, ask yourself...

748
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:28,135
does any of us wish to part ways?

749
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:34,878
This answer proves that...

750
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:38,273
that a man may hate someone...

751
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:41,747
but deep in his heart, love exists!

752
01:52:42,522 --> 01:52:45,685
Tomorrow, we will part our ways...

753
01:52:46,259 --> 01:52:50,889
but this bond of love
will always be intact!

754
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:59,502
Wherever we may be, the sweet memories
of this place will always be with us!

755
01:53:00,807 --> 01:53:04,038
And to make this union
last forever...

756
01:53:04,677 --> 01:53:08,306
let us forget our differences...

757
01:53:09,082 --> 01:53:11,516
and sing and dance, lets celebrate!

758
01:53:12,552 --> 01:53:15,646
Why should we think
what will happen tomorrow?

759
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:34,906
Help!!

760
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:54,924
Look there!

761
01:58:27,533 --> 01:58:28,363
What happened?

762
01:59:19,852 --> 01:59:20,682
How did this happen?

763
01:59:23,055 --> 01:59:25,751
- Whatever happened is not good.
- We should inform the professor.

764
01:59:26,259 --> 01:59:29,695
Alright, but first we should
take her to the church.

765
01:59:41,807 --> 01:59:43,434
We should immediately
inform the police.

766
01:59:43,743 --> 01:59:46,644
You don't worry,
I shall do it in the morning.

767
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:50,443
Why wait till morning, we should
make a report now itself.

768
01:59:50,683 --> 01:59:54,380
- Can we make a call
from your place? - Why not?

769
02:00:05,798 --> 02:00:07,060
Please come in, professor.

770
02:00:19,845 --> 02:00:21,142
This phone is dead!

771
02:00:21,314 --> 02:00:26,616
Lts dead! It does happen sometimes.

772
02:00:27,453 --> 02:00:31,412
- I think a tree must have fallen
over the wire. - Without a storm?

773
02:00:31,991 --> 02:00:34,687
Never mind, I will myself
go to the police station.

774
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:36,828
No sir, one of us will go there.

775
02:00:36,996 --> 02:00:37,826
Sir, I will go!

776
02:00:50,409 --> 02:00:53,173
- Where did both of them disappear?
- This is very strange!

777
02:00:53,946 --> 02:00:55,106
Come with me.

778
02:00:59,151 --> 02:01:01,517
- What happened?
- Why did the lights go off?

779
02:01:15,835 --> 02:01:18,201
Where is Sister Sophiya's coffin?

780
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:21,738
- What is the matter? - The ghost
had come here. - A ghost?!

781
02:01:23,776 --> 02:01:29,009
- The coffin was here now! - How
did this happen in your presence?

782
02:01:29,982 --> 02:01:32,542
A ghost came here and after that,
we don't remember anything.

783
02:01:33,185 --> 02:01:35,278
Rajesh, Baldev, this was
the same ghost!

784
02:01:36,589 --> 02:01:39,558
- Lets go. - Rajesh,
where are you'll going?

785
02:01:39,992 --> 02:01:42,893
Today we will find out
the truth, sir.

786
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:06,008
- You?! - Who is he?

787
02:08:06,445 --> 02:08:08,538
Thakur's butler!

788
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:13,417
So is he the ghost who has
killed so many people?

789
02:08:14,453 --> 02:08:17,945
You swine! Where have you hidden
Sister Sophiya's corpse?

790
02:08:18,123 --> 02:08:26,223
- Where is professor Laxmi?
- This is why no bullet hurts him!

791
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:32,434
- Who are you? - I have to
settle few score with Thakur.

792
02:08:32,938 --> 02:08:37,568
- Oh, I see! - Tell us where
Thakur is or I'll shoot!

793
02:08:39,878 --> 02:08:42,779
Come on, tell us!

794
02:09:03,168 --> 02:09:05,932
Please leave her, Thakur.

795
02:09:07,639 --> 02:09:12,269
You may kill me,
but don't torture her.

796
02:09:13,445 --> 02:09:17,279
Tell us about the treasure and
I will leave you and your daughter.

797
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:22,011
Thomas, how can you be
such an unsympathetic father?

798
02:09:22,788 --> 02:09:26,087
To keep your word, you don't
care about your daughter's life?

799
02:09:26,925 --> 02:09:31,021
Forget him Manager, lets not
waste more time on him!

800
02:09:31,730 --> 02:09:36,497
- Will you tell me or
shall I shoot her? - No!

801
02:09:38,070 --> 02:09:42,700
Don't kill her, I will tell you!

802
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:51,313
The treasure is hidden under
the tomb near the temple.

803
02:09:54,086 --> 02:09:57,522
- Can I meet my daughter now?
- Yes, why not?

804
02:09:59,758 --> 02:10:02,784
Sophiya, my child!

805
02:10:21,246 --> 02:10:26,411
Don't worry about me,
you'll go after that man!

806
02:16:26,678 --> 02:16:28,441
Thank you very much!

807
02:16:29,281 --> 02:16:36,847
- But tell us who you are?
- I am a CID officer. - What?

808
02:16:37,222 --> 02:16:40,783
Yes, we suspected Thakur
since a long time.

809
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:44,723
But we could not do anything
due to lack of evidence.

810
02:16:45,697 --> 02:16:49,394
I thank you and your students...

811
02:16:49,568 --> 02:16:52,731
you'll have endangered your lives
and helped the police.

812
02:16:55,507 --> 02:16:57,407
But why did Thakur do this?

813
02:16:58,243 --> 02:17:02,612
He was possessed with greed and due
to this, he even killed his brother.

814
02:17:03,582 --> 02:17:06,949
With the fear of being exposed,
he got his maid killed.

815
02:17:07,786 --> 02:17:10,755
To create fear amidst the people,
he made his servant play a ghost.

816
02:17:10,989 --> 02:17:13,423
He made that man kill
many people here.

817
02:17:13,792 --> 02:17:16,761
But who was that old man
in the cellar?

818
02:17:17,662 --> 02:17:21,428
He was Sophiya's father Thomas, he
knew the location of the treasure.

819
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:26,499
And finally, when his affection
compelled him to tell the location...

820
02:17:26,671 --> 02:17:28,969
of the treasure,
Thakur killed him too!

821
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:33,768
May his soul rest in peace!

822
02:17:35,347 --> 02:17:38,441
Inspector, can we take away
Sister Sophiya's coffin?

823
02:17:41,486 --> 02:17:42,783
Please come this way!

824
02:18:04,509 --> 02:18:07,205
- What is this? - They used
the coffin for smuggling.

825
02:18:07,579 --> 02:18:11,743
They took Professor Laxmi along
so that nobody should suspect them.

826
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:18,080
But inspector, where is
Sister Sophiya's body?

827
02:18:18,323 --> 02:18:19,551
That is in Thakur's bungalow.

828
02:18:24,729 --> 02:18:27,755
We don't know how to thank you'll.

829
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:33,037
We request you'll to wait till the
installation of the idol...

830
02:18:33,271 --> 02:18:35,364
it will please us a lot.

831
02:18:35,674 --> 02:18:38,575
If we come here again, we will
surely visit your temple.

832
02:18:40,412 --> 02:18:45,315
We are glad that you people
have got back your rights.

833
02:18:46,885 --> 02:18:52,323
At the same time we grieve at
the death of our two companions...

834
02:18:53,625 --> 02:18:58,528
Lallu and Sister Sophiya.

835
02:19:00,231 --> 02:19:03,064
But we console ourselves
with the thought that...

836
02:19:03,234 --> 02:19:05,794
there is sacrifice involved
in every good deed!

837
02:19:07,839 --> 02:19:13,209
We are leaving but their memories
will always be alive in our minds.

838
02:19:14,779 --> 02:19:15,871
Please permit us to leave!
