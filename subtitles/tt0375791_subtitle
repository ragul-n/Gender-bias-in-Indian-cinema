1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
29.970

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,296
Save me!

3
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,309
Mother, give me
a towel!

4
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,065
His bath will not be completed without
taking a towel from me!

5
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,734
Kid Sissy! Have you ironed
my clothes?

6
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,569
Yes, I have done it

7
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,781
You are asking as if I wouldn't
do it without your asking for

8
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:18,907
I am bringing it now!

9
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,202
The lover wants
to meet...

10
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,498
It is already 9 and its still
showing 4 A.M.

11
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,000
Everyday it comes up-to 4 and then
gets stuck up there!

12
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,503
Mother, brother has again
poured water on me

13
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,047
You are not made
of salt.

14
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,256
You melt like it the moment
water is poured on you

15
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:36,966
Come on start.

16
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,095
Father, this watch always
sticks to time

17
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,806
Once it shows a particular time
it won't budge from there.

18
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,348
Give it to me.

19
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,518
But how will you
see the time?

20
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,769
I will get it
repaired

21
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,271
Or ask some one, everybody
wear watches these days

22
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,774
Come, breakfast is
ready.

23
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,528
Mother, I won't take
breakfast.

24
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:57,821
Why?

25
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,533
Because I had to reach at 10 o'clock
and its now 4 o'clock

26
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,077
4! Watch has
stopped

27
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,789
Till now I don't know what work
he is doing?

28
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,543
He doesn't have time to have
breakfast also

29
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:12,794
Give me one

30
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,296
What will you lose, you
have so many

31
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,009
It. is not for free
Do you have money?

32
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:24,055
If I don't have money, so what?
Give me one - NO

33
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,809
What will you lose by
giving one. It is not for free

34
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,814
Ay! You want
the flag child - Yes

35
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,326
Take, our India is better then
rest of the World

36
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,331
I know I will find
you here

37
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,834
I am fixing the fight
for next week

38
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,588
We will get good money
for this fight

39
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,603
shut up

40
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,362
He is right

41
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,613
Your father doesn't like our
friendship

42
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,536
And since he came to know that I
dance in the club... from then...

43
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,623
You sing in the club
to run the house

44
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,125
You fight to run
the house

45
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,628
You have become a Salesman
to run the house

46
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,255
You are working
not begging

47
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,008
Today I will also sing with
you in the club

48
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,621
What's it mother

49
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,083
Nothing my son
go to sleep

50
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,837
Mother has tears in her eyes
instead of sleep

51
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,340
And the son should
sleep

52
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,842
Tell me Mother what's
the matter?

53
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,601
It is the duty of parents to give
comforts to children

54
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:35,857
But, but I have given you
worries and troubles only

55
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,611
What are you talking
mother?

56
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,572
You have given me birth and father
has educated me

57
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,867
I am not a child anymore,
I have grown up

58
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,954
That's why it is my duty to look
after the house 

59
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,123
Now tell me what's
the problem?

60
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,128
You know father is not
keeping well

61
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,882
His health is deteriorating
day by day

62
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,887
Now Choti is no more
a child

63
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,972
She has grown up

64
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:12,143
She has to be married
This is my worry

65
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,604
Is that all mother?

66
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,941
For such a small matter you are
shedding priceless tears

67
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,944
I have already talked to
the doctor 

68
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,446
I am taking father for check up
next week

69
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,740
As regards Choti

70
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,410
Stop worrying about her and search
for a good boy for her

71
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,912
Then see, I will get her
married in a grand way

72
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,580
Forget the grandeur

73
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,585
For a simple marriage 1 or 1112 Lakhs
are needed these days

74
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,964
Where will you get so
much money from?

75
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,425
I will take advance from
my Company.

76
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,760
Or borrow from
friends

77
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,178
And if that is also not
sufficient, then?

78
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,681
You don't worry about
that mother 

79
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,686
Even a poor man is a lakhier
these days

80
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,188
Because he has a
priceless body

81
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,445
Mother, if I sell one of my kidney's
Choti will get married

82
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,450
The mother who has given me such
a strong body

83
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,203
Can't I give one Kidney from
that body?

84
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,664
I won't die mother

85
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:15,957
My son

86
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,589
Tell me, What's the new
problem today?

87
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,967
We people have only one problem
in our lives

88
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,721
Bread. For that money
is required

89
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,475
And I need lot
of money

90
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:38,480
Lot of money! I will give you
an idea

91
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,982
There is a bank on the corner
rob it

92
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,777
You want me to put my family
in a fix 

93
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,987
And go to Jail

94
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,741
Friend, I do want money
but honest money

95
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,285
I have to buy rations
for the house.

96
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,662
Pay Choti's fees, pay
Milk bill

97
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,500
All right I will fix your fight for
tonight itself

98
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,756
Ajay Chauhan change
your dress

99
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,515
You! What are you
doing here?

100
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,766
Waiting for you

101
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,309
Why didn't you meet me for
the last 2 days

102
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,520
Pooja I have to go out for
some important...

103
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,022
You can go

104
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,525
At least talk to me sweetly
for sometime

105
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,320
I have told you many
times that 

106
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,530
Talks don't fill the
stomach

107
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,032
For that you have to
work, work

108
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,535
And I have told you
many times that 

109
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,037
Life is not meant only
for work

110
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,791
Loving a little is also
very important

111
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,042
Yes, you are correct

112
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:46,047
But if I don't work, how will
I earn money

113
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,550
Ajay, Don't worry about
money

114
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:49,926
You know very well that -

115
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,806
Giving you 1 or 2 lakhs is not
at all diffi cult for me

116
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,308
But taking money from you is very
difficult for me

117
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,313
I want to feed my family with my
hand earned money

118
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,816
Not by the gift
of someone...

119
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,570
Are you angry?

120
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,072
No

121
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,575
Then tell me when will
you meet me?

122
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,244
You are coming to see my fi ght
this evening?

123
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,580
How can I miss it?

124
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,165
Then we will meet
there itself

125
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,906
What are you doing? All the money
will be lost

126
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,618
Get up hit him
hit him

127
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,364
Mother haven't you
slept yet

128
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,825
Have I ever slept till
you come home?

129
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,579
Why are you so late?
Come

130
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,835
There was lot of work today that's
why I had to do overtime

131
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:40,091
Don't work so hard.
It's 2 oâ€™clock in the night

132
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:46,348
Like this you will spoil
your health son

133
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,934
I have to complete the orders
of the Company

134
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,855
Enough of talks,
come and eat

135
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,111
What's wrong with her?
Why is she angry?

136
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,865
You met father and
talk to mother also

137
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:07,619
Did you bother about your
younger sister at all?

138
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,373
Don't fight

139
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,875
He must be tired after days
hard work

140
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,713
I will serve food to brother
today, come brother

141
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,146
Why are you looking?
Eat brother

142
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,944
I will eat, you go
and sleep

143
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,654
Don't worry about me
brother 

144
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,364
I am not feeling sleepy
at all

145
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:47,701
What happened brother?

146
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:48,952
Nothing

147
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,161
Show me
- Show me

148
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:52,706
Nothing has happened
- Show me

149
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:53,915
I told you nothing
has happened

150
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,418
I am telling you
show me

151
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,381
Brother how did the hand get
cut so badly?

152
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,925
It is a small hurt, it will
become alright

153
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,344
I know you, are not working
in any company

154
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,015
But you are working in
such a place

155
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,600
Where you have to spill
your blood

156
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,186
How much more you are going to
suffer for this house, brother?

157
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,731
Not for this alone.

158
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:20,191
But I am doing all this because I
have to send you out of this house

159
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,694
I have to send you to
some place

160
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:23,945
Where you will be
happy

161
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,238
No brother

162
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:28,324
That happiness that comfort is not
acceptable to me

163
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,201
Which will be generated
by your pain

164
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,206
Ay Choti, are you
crying?

165
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,794
I can't do anything else
for your brother

166
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,714
Let me at-least shed
tears

167
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:46,468
Here eat it

168
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,226
Brother you will have to make one
promise today

169
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,980
For any amount of pain and any
amount of trouble

170
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,734
Only I will cry
not you

171
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:11,618
Mother

172
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:12,660
What is it?

173
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,042
What is it?
Tell me

174
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,754
What is the date
today?

175
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,341
Date, 13

176
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:27,759
And month?

177
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,303
July, Why?

178
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,764
Mother, I forgot but you
should remember

179
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,518
That its 13th July, it means
your birthday

180
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,523
Oh yes today is
mother's birthday

181
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,276
Shut up

182
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,779
You don't remember anything and
start singing 

183
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,030
Give me the
sugar bowl

184
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:53,535
Here take it mother, take
this sweet

185
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,538
Enough, Enough, Enough

186
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,291
You have given me the sweets now
you also take this sweet

187
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:01,584
Why, Why?

188
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,754
Because the company where you
wanted to work

189
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,799
Has sent you the
interview letter

190
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,343
They have called you
tomorrow

191
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,553
Tomorrow itself

192
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,639
That means I will have to leave
by this evening's train

193
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,809
Yes, you will have to go by the
evening train

194
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,604
Little one!
- What's it?

195
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:22,772
Keep two sets of clothes
in the bag

196
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,316
I will send Gopal, send them
through him

197
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:30,196
You will always ask me to
do something!

198
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,573
Why should I do
your work?

199
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,326
Alright, what are you going to
bring for me from there?

200
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,245
If I get the
job there

201
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,789
I will bring anything from there,
that you may ask for

202
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,583
Tell me what do
you want?

203
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:46,421
You told me that you want to send
me out from this house

204
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,090
I won't go so
easily

205
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,844
Get me a nice
wedding dress

206
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:56,598
And heena packets
and lot of bangles

207
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,603
Mother, I will wear bangles in
both the hands 

208
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,147
And I will sing
this song

209
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:08,276
I have nine bangles
in my hands

210
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,238
I have nine bangles
in my hands

211
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,115
Keep quiet, shameless
girl

212
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,869
Don't you feel ashamed to talk
about your own marriage

213
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:22,874
Hurry up, son otherwise you will
get late, and listen

214
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,586
There is a famous goddess
temple there

215
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:30,382
Before going to the interview make
an offerings to the Goddess

216
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:39,140
What are these scratches on
your face 

217
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:41,643
Were you involved in
a brawl?

218
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,397
No sir, I had met with a
small accident

219
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,150
Sir here are my certifi cates
and my degree

220
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:51,695
That's alright, but

221
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,155
Whose recommendation do
you have?

222
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,700
Recommendation?

223
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,909
Yes recommendation

224
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,453
Sir, I have nobody's recommendation
with me

225
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,831
Okay, how much money do
you have?

226
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,668
I am a straight
forward man

227
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,170
I don't beat about
the bush

228
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:14,175
By giving you the job, what will
be my benefit?

229
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,180
After sitting on
this chair

230
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:21,683
You will also earn
lakhs in future

231
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,437
Sir my income will be
only my pay

232
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,981
You'll get pay only after I give
you the job

233
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,944
You have neither recommendation
nor money and you

234
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,447
Doesn't matter

235
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,949
Have you any sister
at home

236
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:47,959
Rascal if 10 unemployed youth
were not sitting outside

237
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,462
You'll be giving a job to
one of them

238
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,006
I would've taught you
a lesson just now

239
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,969
You might have got this job by
pimping for your sister

240
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:01,723
But we poor people spit
on such a chair

241
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:10,482
Listen, come and join
tomorrow

242
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,070
Don't be surprised

243
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,989
I was only testing you

244
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,743
I said some mean
things

245
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:24,162
This recommendation
this bribe

246
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,748
Is a very signifi cant
thing

247
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,753
For getting such jobs people pimp
for their sisters

248
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:39,260
I am happy to select a correct and
honest person

249
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,029
Do go to the temple
of goddess

250
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,370
Thanks a million
on Goddess 

251
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:06,788
That you got me
this job

252
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,709
Mother had told me to visit you
before going for the interview

253
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,044
But I had forgotten

254
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:15,755
I have brought this
coconut for you

255
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,159
Catch him, catch him
he is the same catch him

256
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,912
See that he doesn't escape
catch him

257
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:49,664
What did that
woman say?

258
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:37,962
Hey! What are you
doing?

259
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:11,746
I haven't done anything, I don't
know anything sir

260
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,008
Do you recognize
this place

261
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:26,761
Sir, which place are you talking
about. I don't know anything

262
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:31,266
No sir

263
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,525
I have told you that
I don't know anything 

264
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:42,652
You are trying to involve me
by force

265
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:04,299
You hit a policeman. You want
to beat them

266
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:06,551
Tell me who is this
tell me?

267
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,346
I have told you so many times
that I don't know anything

268
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,264
I know that you know everything
- No

269
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:14,517
You have 2 more associates
Tell me their names

270
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,104
I don't know anything.
Leave me

271
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,314
You know everything

272
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:20,607
Leave me!

273
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:21,858
You don't want to say

274
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:23,068
I don't know!

275
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:27,238
Take him away

276
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,389
Yes, What's the matter?

277
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:36,891
We want to get this
man identified

278
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,655
This is very important
for us

279
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,158
But as a doctor it is very
important for me 

280
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,368
To save the life of
my patients

281
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,331
That girl is in coma

282
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,419
The second one is fighting
for her life

283
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,087
And this one

284
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,424
She is not in a fit condition to
answer your questions

285
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,719
Doctor I don't want to ask
any questions

286
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:15,972
I want to show them
his face

287
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,434
Doctor please try
to understand

288
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,188
We have to produce in the
court by tomorrow

289
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,705
Miss. Sheetal, look at this
boy and tell me

290
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,209
Whether he is the same
boy who raped you

291
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:49,089
Look at him, recognize him
don't be scared

292
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,218
Tell us, Sheetal open
your eyes

293
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,360
Please, you go out
please

294
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:13,238
Just, once doctor

295
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:15,782
What else do you want
to know?

296
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:18,702
The girl who started trembling
after his face

297
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,745
And started crying!

298
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,040
What conclusion do you
come to by it?

299
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,002
No doctor, I am
innocent

300
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:33,258
Please, sister look at me

301
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:35,760
And try to
recognize me

302
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,514
Tell them I am absolutely
innocent

303
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:40,765
Enough, Enough

304
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,227
Nothing more is necessary
take him away

305
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:50,483
No doctor, I am not that person
I am innocent believe me

306
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,822
Give me a chance to talk
to that girl

307
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:59,534
I will prove that
I am innocent

308
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,384
What Mr. Teacher, did you
come to know 

309
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:20,388
Ajay is in which jail and when is
he getting released 

310
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:24,184
Such a person should be shot dead
before everyone

311
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,728
What's need to find out about
such a son

312
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,857
He has put his father to
damn shame

313
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,067
You are right
uncle Dheenu 

314
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,820
If it was my son I would have
strangled him

315
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:41,785
Come doctor.
Come inside

316
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:50,835
Has my son come?

317
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:52,587
Parvati, I have brought
the doctor

318
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,092
I don't need the doctor
I need my son

319
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:01,221
You, go to the police station and
find out about him

320
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:05,475
He won't be released soon
he is gone for a long time

321
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,353
He won't come
out soon

322
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,107
Choti, go and close that
door also - Yes

323
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:18,863
To tell you the truth, I feel sorry
for him also

324
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,659
He has ruined the life of 3
innocent girls

325
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,121
Justice demands that he should
be punished - Yes

326
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:28,373
But look at his
courage

327
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,875
Having a grown
up sister 

328
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,629
He should have been ashamed to do
such a treacherous deed

329
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,132
Yes, yes he should feel
ashamed off

330
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:41,636
Come

331
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:29,059
Rascal, in front of girls college
you are acting as a gangster

332
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,187
Go inside

333
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,443
What are you looking at
what are you looking at?

334
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,945
Are you looking
at me?

335
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,699
Take him away

336
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:00,507
Don't you know how to talk
to a person?

337
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:04,719
Is it the way to talk to dignified
and decent people

338
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:07,222
Good you have come

339
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:09,724
I am a school
teacher

340
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,478
It is my duty to impart good
education to children

341
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,273
And the crime that you are
accusing on my son

342
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,734
Is baseless and false

343
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:26,950
You are selling
your daughter

344
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:28,493
And you are talking about
imparting good education

345
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:33,498
Look, don't ridicule
us like this

346
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:36,001
We know our Ajay
very well

347
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,754
Yes, I know, 10 gallons of liquor
was found in your room

348
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,262
Listen, if he doesn't present himself
here by tomorrow morning

349
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:49,806
I will treat you
so badly

350
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,267
That you will be ashamed to show
your face in the neighborhood

351
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,538
Inspector, leave my
family

352
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,292
I will release them after the
court's verdict

353
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,548
My lord on the
evening of 13th

354
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:26,051
In the hall of Chetna
College

355
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,804
3 innocent girls were
brutally raped

356
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:32,349
That rape was not committed by
any one else

357
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:34,976
But by this boy and his
2 associates

358
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:41,066
And to prove this, my first witness
is Inspector Vijay Sharma

359
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,071
Inspector Vijay. When you took
the accused to the hospital.

360
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:48,073
What happened there?

361
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,700
Sir, Victim of rape
Sheetal Dogra

362
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,829
After seeing the accused started
screaming madly

363
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,332
After seeing him she
got so scared

364
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:59,167
That she started crying
and shouting

365
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:01,086
Mr. Judge she couldn't
recognize me

366
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:03,713
And she didn't say that
I am that boy

367
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:08,218
Okay! She didn't
say that

368
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:12,347
But after seeing you that girl
started crying madly

369
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:14,891
isn't that true?

370
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:15,809
Yes

371
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:21,981
Now my second witness
is Mr. Jaitly

372
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,864
The day when that happened
were you there?

373
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,116
Yes

374
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:33,618
I am the Correspondent Offi cer
of that college

375
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:37,372
And I have to go there often to
attend to my work

376
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:39,874
On that day also I was
present there

377
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:42,377
Can you say it with
confidence

378
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,672
That the rapist of 3 girls
of your college

379
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:49,884
Was none other than
this boy

380
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,889
Certainly!

381
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:59,269
When this boy and his 2 associates
were running away after raping

382
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,439
Then I saw him from
close quarters

383
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,899
It is a lie, it's a lie Mr. Judge
He is telling a lie

384
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,156
You will be given the chance
to prove your innocence

385
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:14,325
My lord, I want to
produce my last

386
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:15,785
And important witness

387
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:20,540
Principal of Chetna College
Mrs. Prathibha Jaitly

388
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:36,598
Will you tell the court as to
what happened that day

389
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:39,934
Mr. Judge

390
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:45,940
3 of my students were rehearsing
a drama in the hall

391
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,986
Suddenly, I heard someone
shrieking

392
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:52,447
Save me!

393
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:58,703
Save me!

394
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,959
Save me!

395
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:28,400
Everyone is lying!

396
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:32,487
Mr. Ajay, this lady shouted after
seeing you in the temple

397
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,907
Because of that you
were arrested

398
00:43:36,282 --> 00:43:38,368
Did you see this woman ever before?
- No, Mr. Judge

399
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:42,539
Does she harbor any personal
animus against you?

400
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:43,748
No, No sir

401
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,251
Then why is she calling out your
name repeatedly

402
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,005
I will appeal to
the court

403
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,508
To award maximum punishment
to the accused 

404
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,261
So that no one else does such
an abominable act

405
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:02,517
In the light of witness
and the evidences

406
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:06,312
lt. is proved that

407
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:10,900
The accused Ajay and his 2
associates have committed rape

408
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:15,030
The serious crime that the
accused has committed

409
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:18,783
The minimum punishment should
be, "hang to death"

410
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:20,410
Mr. Judge I am absolutely
innocent

411
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:23,788
But the constraints of law
has made me helpless

412
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:29,419
That's why under
I.P.C. 376

413
00:44:30,086 --> 00:44:36,301
I award him 7 years of rigorous
imprisonment

414
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:37,552
No

415
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,268
Oh lord, give me
the boon

416
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,813
I shouldn't budge from
good deeds

417
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:50,273
I should not be afraid of
enemies and

418
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:52,025
Fight them 100 times

419
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:53,860
And resolve to win
definitely

420
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:37,612
Close the door

421
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:44,327
Sir, Are your intentions
good?

422
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:47,372
If my intentions were bad then
I would've locked the door

423
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:51,418
Look you know, I am an
strict editor 

424
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,920
Because my boss
is Mr. Time.

425
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,130
We must be on
time

426
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:57,757
Do you know that you are going
to lose your job

427
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,386
Sit down, look

428
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:03,888
You know Bombay Times
is in the red.

429
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:05,765
There are losses
all around

430
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:08,935
That's why 100 people are listed
to be dismissed.

431
00:46:08,935 --> 00:46:10,145
Your name is there in
that list

432
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,898
In the beginning or
in the end

433
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:16,401
Oh it doesn't make any dif ference
if it is in the middle

434
00:46:16,901 --> 00:46:18,903
Listen, you are a good
reporter

435
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:21,031
And I like the style of
your working

436
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,909
That's why I will talk to M.D. on
phone and recommend you

437
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:28,955
Here take this and talk
immediately

438
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:30,165
No, No, No the time has not
yet been fixed

439
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,421
When will you phone? After
I lose the job

440
00:46:37,255 --> 00:46:40,216
I can recommend you to
M.D. only.

441
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:42,677
When you bring some
sensational news

442
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,682
Bring such a news that will
create a sensation

443
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:51,436
Sir, will there be bomb
blast everyday?

444
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,146
Will a VIP die everyday?

445
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,441
Oh! I will help you
this time

446
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,990
This is the file of
that boy

447
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,451
Who had been sentenced to
7 years for rape

448
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:10,205
But because of good conduct he is
being released earlier

449
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:11,456
Have a look

450
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:26,930
His face is like
a rapist

451
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:28,973
Court also felt
the same

452
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:33,645
But the boy, till the end, said
that he is innocent

453
00:47:34,396 --> 00:47:37,732
According to reports, rape was
committed by 3 people

454
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:41,486
But the boy didn't tell the name
of his 2 associates

455
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:44,447
After coming out
this boy

456
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:46,241
Will try to meet
his associates

457
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:48,993
Or they will try to
meet him

458
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:52,414
If you find out those
2 boys and prove

459
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,250
That they were the other
rapists

460
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:57,752
Then I feel it could be a
very big news

461
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:00,255
Yes sir, it can be

462
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:03,133
But suppose if we proceed
on the assumption 

463
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,260
That this boy is
really innocent

464
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:07,762
Then my entire labour
will be futile

465
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,265
If this boy was
innocent

466
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,521
If this boy wasn't
innocent

467
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:19,065
Then those 2 will defi nitely
come to meet him

468
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:21,568
That's why if we keep an eye
on this boy 

469
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:22,777
We can know about the
real culprits

470
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,280
What are you
thinking?

471
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:27,824
No sir I was thinking
that

472
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:30,910
A day will come when some
boy will chase me

473
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:34,748
The demands of this service has
reversed the process

474
00:48:35,623 --> 00:48:37,834
Now I will have to chase
this boy

475
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:40,295
You'll have to. It's a
question of livelihood

476
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:41,588
Sir, I will do it

477
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:44,174
You may go now
bread... Rosy

478
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,807
Ajay! You are being
released today

479
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:56,019
Nothing has changed in the
outside world

480
00:48:57,854 --> 00:49:01,566
The world is the same as you had
seen it 4 years ago

481
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:05,320
But these 4 years has
changed me Mr. Jailor

482
00:49:07,864 --> 00:49:10,325
Another suffix has been
added to my name

483
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:11,951
Criminal

484
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:16,122
Even then, I wouldn't like
to meet you again

485
00:49:17,874 --> 00:49:19,876
At least never in
this jail

486
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:21,586
Don't worry
Mr. Jailor

487
00:49:22,879 --> 00:49:25,340
I won't come to this
jail again

488
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:29,094
At least never as an
innocent person

489
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:04,272
Ganesh, this skirt won't be
even 112 meter

490
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:08,068
No pal, it will defi nitely be
112 meter

491
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,528
What are you talking?
Bet 50 Rs. 501 

492
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:11,780
Okay! Done

493
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:18,912
Please don't get angry I will have
to measure your skirt

494
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,790
It is not necessary

495
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:26,795
Hey! Run!

496
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:31,800
Ay you! You are behaving
as a hero

497
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:35,553
You want to measure the skirts of
girls going on the road

498
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:39,307
I will tell both of you the
measurement of law

499
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,061
Take them to the
Police station

500
00:51:43,895 --> 00:51:44,312
Nice thing happened to them!

501
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,317
Go inside - Go

502
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:03,081
Hey! Stop!

503
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:07,377
What's your name?

504
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:10,588
Where are you going?

505
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:15,593
Where is your house?

506
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:23,101
Jawahar Nagar is
my area

507
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:26,813
I haven't seen you ever
this side before

508
00:52:28,606 --> 00:52:30,650
Sir, I am going home
after 4 years

509
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,362
Why? Where were you
for 4 years?

510
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:36,823
I was in a jail

511
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:41,536
What? I couldn't hear?
What did you say?

512
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,836
I told you I was
in a jail

513
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,880
For what crime did
you go to the jail?

514
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:54,382
What am I asking?

515
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:57,260
For what crime did you
go to the jail?

516
00:52:57,802 --> 00:52:59,387
In a rape case!

517
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,141
I see! Rape!

518
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:06,895
You did a great thing!

519
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:10,648
I hate criminals!

520
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:15,653
Particularly those who molest
innocent girls

521
00:53:16,946 --> 00:53:19,407
You stay in my area that's why
I am advising you

522
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,161
Keep away from me

523
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:26,915
If you are caught for
any crime

524
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,586
I will break your
hands and legs

525
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:36,925
Didn't hear? Get out
from here

526
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:11,960
Brother, brother, brother
you have come brother!

527
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:16,965
You are alright. How are
you brother?

528
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:18,591
Get back Choti

529
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,221
How dare you enter
this house?

530
00:54:24,889 --> 00:54:26,599
Dare you call me
father!

531
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:29,144
The relationship between us
is finished

532
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,231
You are dead for us and we are
dead for you, understand

533
00:54:34,524 --> 00:54:35,358
What are you
talking?

534
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:39,112
Son has returned after 4 years
and you...

535
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,990
He hasn't won any war for
the Country

536
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:43,241
For which I should
welcome him

537
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,953
He has put a black mark on
the entire family!

538
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:50,749
Look... Look at her!

539
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,502
Because of you she can't even
step out of the house!

540
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:58,256
They tease her, they see her
with bad intentions!

541
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:02,010
Go!

542
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:03,261
Go away from here!

543
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:07,057
After a great difficulty our
wounds have healed!

544
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:07,557
Don't scratch it
a fresh again!

545
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:09,059
Don't scratch it!

546
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:09,517
Go!

547
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,271
Hey! Brother, why don't you walk on
one side of the road?

548
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:17,025
Don't know, what people will be
dreaming in broad day light?

549
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:51,351
Hey! Brother!
Who are you?

550
00:55:58,358 --> 00:55:59,567
Hey! What do you want?

551
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:03,321
Here, my... I mean Mr. Chowhan
used to live here

552
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:05,448
Who is this
Mr. Chowhan?

553
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:07,075
He...

554
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:13,331
He? Oh! I see! Are you asking
about that school teacher?

555
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:16,543
Yes, madam! I am asking
about him only!

556
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:17,544
Where is he?

557
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:19,587
It is 4 yrs since
he has died

558
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,844
Here... here only... he hanged
himself to death!

559
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:42,110
And his wife and
daughter?

560
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:45,864
There people have ill-treated
with those poor things!

561
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,366
How could they pay the
rent of the house?

562
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:51,327
The house owner threw them
out of the house!

563
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,874
For few days they lived here
on the streets

564
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,879
And then one day a drunkard
tried to molest the girl

565
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,884
After that never knew their whereabouts
of the mother and the daughter

566
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:09,679
But you didn't tell me

567
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:10,889
Why were you asking
about them?

568
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:14,642
I am Mr. Chowhan's son!

569
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,647
Okay... Okay... So that
was you!

570
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:23,068
For whom the whole family split
and got separated

571
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:28,448
If you were so thirsty you could have
quenched your thirst in the harlot

572
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:32,160
What was the necessity to
rape innocent girls?

573
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:34,662
Get away from here!

574
00:57:58,478 --> 00:57:59,646
Look my child! What has your father
brought for you?

575
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:08,113
When will you... When will you awake
from this deep sleep, my child?

576
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,451
When will you talk with
your father?  

577
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:33,513
Your criminal has come out
of the jail!  

578
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:41,271
The sentence he got for the crime
is very less!  

579
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,899
I promise you.

580
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:48,653
Till he is alive on
this earth 

581
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:54,284
I will punish him every moment
of his life for his crime!

582
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:33,698
Leave me!

583
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:12,487
So, you have come!

584
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:17,951
Come, I will show you
the product

585
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,000
Open season!

586
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:38,943
I will kill you even if
you squeak

587
01:03:40,236 --> 01:03:41,446
He should be somewhere
here only

588
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:45,200
Certainly, but it isn't so easy
to find him here

589
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:50,205
Even in broad daylight, it is difficult
to search here in this slum

590
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:52,707
How can we find him
in night?

591
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,418
I think, we must go
from here!

592
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:58,963
Where did he
vanish?

593
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:06,471
Sir, why do these dogs always
bark on the policemen?

594
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:10,225
You are standing in front of it
why don't you ask it?

595
01:04:10,558 --> 01:04:11,518
Alright!

596
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:12,727
Come... Come let's go!

597
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:25,240
Forgive me! I never intended
to kill you

598
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:28,993
But the police were
after me

599
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:43,758
Mother!

600
01:04:55,311 --> 01:04:57,772
I have tired after crying
continuously my son!

601
01:04:58,523 --> 01:05:01,818
Where were you? Come on
tell me?

602
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:09,034
Mother, don't mistake
me!

603
01:05:10,326 --> 01:05:11,745
I never did anything
wrong

604
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:16,541
I was innocent then, I am
innocent even now!

605
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:21,421
Mother! I swear on you, I never
did anything wrong

606
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:26,426
My son, I know it that my progeny
wouldn't commit such heinous crime

607
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:30,305
Mother, that day after the interview
I went to the temple

608
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:32,849
To pay the respects to the
mother Goddess!

609
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:34,017
There...

610
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,352
Enough... Enough my
son!

611
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:39,022
I can understand everything no need
for you to explain it

612
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:44,611
You went to the temple to
pray Mother Goddess

613
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:47,697
And Mother Goddess has
chosen you...

614
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:54,079
To punish those who don't
consider woman as woman

615
01:05:55,997 --> 01:05:59,042
And perpetuate atrocities oppress and
molest the chastity of woman

616
01:06:00,377 --> 01:06:05,215
Your father couldn't bear the
taunts of the society!

617
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:08,968
And how could he
bear it?

618
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:15,392
The son who was his life and
who was his pride.

619
01:06:17,894 --> 01:06:21,606
About whom the society talked
so badly.

620
01:06:23,024 --> 01:06:25,360
He committed suicide!

621
01:06:36,621 --> 01:06:39,124
Do you know why
I am living?

622
01:06:41,626 --> 01:06:44,129
One day you'll
return home

623
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:49,134
And punish those demons who were
responsible for our family's ruin

624
01:06:54,139 --> 01:06:55,223
In the name of
your father!

625
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:57,892
In the name of
your mother!

626
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:00,395
And the black mark
on yourself!

627
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:04,149
I promise you mother

628
01:07:06,526 --> 01:07:07,944
Let the persons, who
have ruined us

629
01:07:07,944 --> 01:07:09,612
Hide anywhere in
the world

630
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:12,907
I will search them and
punish them

631
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:19,164
I will prove myself innocent in
front of the society and the world

632
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:24,169
Hereafter I will see your face on
that only when...

633
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:39,184
Mother where is
Choti?

634
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:44,189
Choti, I will tell
about her

635
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:47,942
Doctor my sister is
here choti

636
01:07:49,235 --> 01:07:51,696
Choti? Which Choti?

637
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,239
Roopa Chauhan is
her name

638
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,952
Roopa? Roopa is your sister?
But her brother...

639
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:04,209
Yes doctor, It is not me but Ajay
is Roopa's brother

640
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:07,962
He wasn't here for
4 years

641
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:12,967
That's why I took over the duties
of her brother

642
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:28,441
Ajay come and see
yourself, come

643
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:51,506
Do you know I am going to
get married

644
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:54,259
I have distributed my
wedding cards to everyone

645
01:08:55,552 --> 01:08:56,761
I forgot to give you
people only

646
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:01,725
Don't forget, do come
you will come, isn't it

647
01:09:02,934 --> 01:09:05,729
You take it you take it
and you also take it

648
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:09,274
You must come It will
be great fun

649
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:13,028
My brother is going to get me
married in a grand way

650
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,822
Do you know he has gone
to town

651
01:09:16,823 --> 01:09:18,324
He will bring wedding
dress for me

652
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:22,328
He will bring henna packet
and many bangles

653
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:28,043
I will wear all the bangles
and sing

654
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:41,806
It seems your sister is also
going to get married

655
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:46,811
I know brothers cry a lot in their
sister's marriage

656
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:51,816
My brother also used to say I will
cry a lot in your marriage

657
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:55,570
Take my wedding card

658
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,073
Listen you'll have
to come

659
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:03,078
If my brother cries don't
let him cry

660
01:10:15,006 --> 01:10:18,093
Choti... Choti... I

661
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:23,390
Don't touch me only my brother
can touch, why did you touch me?

662
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:30,647
Roopa, Roopa what are you
doing here?

663
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:32,941
I was distributing my
wedding cards

664
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:35,610
Roopa, nobody distributes her own
wedding cards 

665
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:36,861
Give them to me, I will
distribute them

666
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:40,657
You come, It is time for you to
take your medicine 

667
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:41,908
Come and take
your medicine

668
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:44,494
Oh yes, I had forgotten
COme, COme

669
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:08,143
What all has happened in
4 years

670
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:15,650
Father died. Mother is living
in a hut and Choti

671
01:11:18,278 --> 01:11:19,237
Choti has gone to
Lunatic asylum

672
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:24,409
After seeing all this I don't
have the courage to meet Pooja

673
01:11:26,786 --> 01:11:28,121
Don't think about
Pooja

674
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:31,916
Because even if you wish you
can't meet her

675
01:11:35,086 --> 01:11:38,131
Yes Ajay, Pooja
is dead

676
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:45,638
After you went to jail.

677
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:49,726
Her daddy wanted to get her
married to someone else forcibly

678
01:11:51,102 --> 01:11:54,439
And you know how much
Pooja loved you

679
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:56,149
She killed herself

680
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:16,419
Pig, You lost my goods
worth 2 crores

681
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:21,966
Who was that inspector who
dared to intimidate

682
01:12:23,259 --> 01:12:24,302
Who was he?

683
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:43,279
You don't look such
an idiot

684
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,991
One of your man in the hospital
before dying

685
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:54,708
He has only told the address
of this place

686
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:57,002
Not your name

687
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:03,258
You are very lucky
you have escaped

688
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:05,760
Otherwise instead of
coming here.

689
01:13:06,428 --> 01:13:08,263
I would have called you
to the Police station

690
01:13:09,931 --> 01:13:14,519
And how I deal with criminals
in the Police station

691
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:18,273
Ask some criminal
about it

692
01:13:23,194 --> 01:13:24,529
Mr. Inspector

693
01:13:25,947 --> 01:13:28,283
Perhaps you have
mistaken

694
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:31,494
I am not a criminal but
a businessman

695
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:35,749
I do import and export

696
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:41,880
Business! You said
it correctly

697
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:49,763
You buy and sell
death

698
01:13:55,852 --> 01:13:57,103
But remember one
thing

699
01:13:57,103 --> 01:13:58,313
Don't brow, beat me
Inspector

700
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:00,815
Perhaps you don't
know

701
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,569
To whom you are
talking to

702
01:14:05,862 --> 01:14:07,072
I know very well

703
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:10,825
Your entire family

704
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,082
Your mother was a dancing girl
in prostitutes quarters

705
01:14:25,882 --> 01:14:30,845
And your father was the famous
pimp of that area

706
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:35,850
Truth tasted bitter
isn't it?

707
01:14:37,143 --> 01:14:39,479
It is not good for a person to
tell so much of truth

708
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:47,112
That to make him mum his
breathing has to be stopped

709
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:03,378
This slap was meant for not spoiling
the crease of my uniform

710
01:15:06,381 --> 01:15:07,132
And remember

711
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:17,142
Close this export import business
as soon as possible

712
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:23,398
Because I don't grant much time to
live to the traders of death

713
01:15:35,326 --> 01:15:35,910
He will die

714
01:15:37,829 --> 01:15:40,915
This rascal will die
with my own hands

715
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,172
You can't cheat me
like this

716
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:49,674
You only got that boy released
that boy a day earlier

717
01:15:50,967 --> 01:15:52,177
I reached there
exactly at 9

718
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,930
But being a Sunday he was
released a day earlier

719
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:58,433
Now you tell me
What's my fault in it?

720
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:00,935
You only tell me

721
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:04,689
Where will I look for that loafer in
such a big city

722
01:16:05,982 --> 01:16:09,694
Just once, just once make
him meet me

723
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:11,946
My job hinges
on it

724
01:16:13,615 --> 01:16:15,950
In his article I will mention
about you also

725
01:16:20,205 --> 01:16:22,207
Oh! He is the
same person

726
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,960
Wonderful. you did
a miracle

727
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:29,839
I will offer my prayers
Later on

728
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:32,217
Let me consolidate
my job first

729
01:16:52,278 --> 01:16:55,949
I have never lifted so much of
weight in my entire life before.

730
01:16:57,283 --> 01:16:58,493
My back is aching

731
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:03,957
No, No, No don't ask me to bring
any more files

732
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:07,252
I am not asking you to bring
more files

733
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:12,257
From all the paper here rape case
articles are missing

734
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:16,011
It seems some one else is also
interested in your life

735
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:27,272
I am very hungry, let's eat
first and with that

736
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:32,277
The door is open

737
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:36,031
Did I leave without locking
it by mistake?

738
01:17:37,323 --> 01:17:38,533
You had locked it in
front of me

739
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:42,287
That means thief has robbed
the thief...

740
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,331
Why are you scared.
Let's go inside

741
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:53,548
What a wonderful smell

742
01:18:37,133 --> 01:18:38,593
You people came 10 minutes
earlier

743
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:40,303
Otherwise I would have made
the sweet dish also

744
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:48,603
My name is Ritu

745
01:18:49,896 --> 01:18:51,147
My name is Gopal

746
01:18:51,147 --> 01:18:53,608
You have made all this food
for both of us, isn't it?

747
01:18:54,901 --> 01:18:55,985
This food is not for you both
only, but three of us!

748
01:18:58,655 --> 01:18:59,864
You have put up these
cuttings here?

749
01:19:01,157 --> 01:19:02,909
Yes, I thought they will be
useful to you

750
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,869
But we'll talk afterwards
first let's eat

751
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:12,377
Your friend seems to be in
excessive romantic mood

752
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:16,131
Aye Mister leave my
hand and talk

753
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:21,136
One complaint from me will toss
you in jail for 4 years

754
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,889
I am a press reporter
understand

755
01:19:26,182 --> 01:19:27,392
No, No sister don't commit
that blunder

756
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:29,894
You seem to be a
good girl

757
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,648
That I am. That's why I came
here to help him

758
01:19:36,192 --> 01:19:37,444
But he catches
the hand

759
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:39,904
May I know as why you want
to help me

760
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:43,658
Because I know you are innocent
and you were framed

761
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:46,036
That's why I want
to help you

762
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:49,914
I don't need anybody's
help

763
01:19:50,248 --> 01:19:53,626
This is my own war and I
will fight it myself

764
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:57,255
I know, this is your war and you
want to fight it out alone

765
01:19:59,966 --> 01:20:01,718
But somebody wants to join you
in this war

766
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:03,678
There is no harm
in it

767
01:20:09,976 --> 01:20:11,728
Madam, I am a reporter from
Bombay Times

768
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:13,688
And these two are my
associates

769
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:19,778
What can I do for you?

770
01:20:19,986 --> 01:20:23,740
4 years ago 3 girls were
raped in your College

771
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:26,201
We want to know
about it

772
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:31,164
Yes rape was committed But I
wasn't the Principal at that time

773
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:32,457
Mrs. Jaitley was

774
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:37,504
Her husband Mr. Jaitley is the
correspondent of this College

775
01:20:37,504 --> 01:20:38,713
He is not now

776
01:20:41,257 --> 01:20:42,467
Can you give his
address?

777
01:20:45,011 --> 01:20:48,932
4 years ago Mr. and Mrs Jaitly died
in a car accident

778
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:56,231
But you can give the address of
those 3 girls

779
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:57,857
Who were raped

780
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:01,611
Yes, one of them committed
suicide

781
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:07,492
2nd one is the daughter of the
Inspector, who is still in Coma

782
01:21:10,036 --> 01:21:11,454
Yes, you can get
Sheetal's address

783
01:21:17,544 --> 01:21:20,005
Ram Singh! Take them to
Mr. Sharma

784
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:23,758
Give them the address of
Sheetal Dogra if it can be found

785
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:26,052
Yes, madam

786
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:26,491
Brother save me

787
01:29:41,548 --> 01:29:42,298
Greetings! Madam

788
01:29:42,799 --> 01:29:45,260
My company manufactures many
things. They are quite cheap

789
01:29:46,553 --> 01:29:47,762
Like Pickles, jam etc

790
01:29:49,055 --> 01:29:50,265
Sorry, I don't
need anything

791
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:52,517
At least see them
Sheetal!

792
01:29:58,231 --> 01:29:59,274
How did you know
my name?

793
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:09,034
Shall I tell you here or
shall we go inside

794
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:20,295
Now, tell me who are you and why
have you come here?

795
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:25,300
I am a Press Reporter and I have
come to tell you this

796
01:30:26,593 --> 01:30:29,054
That the boy who went to jail
because of you

797
01:30:29,846 --> 01:30:30,680
He has been released

798
01:30:32,849 --> 01:30:35,310
Because of you his whole
life is ruined

799
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:38,229
His father had committed
suicide

800
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:41,566
His sister is in lunatic
asylum

801
01:30:44,110 --> 01:30:44,611
And you

802
01:30:47,864 --> 01:30:49,074
You got married
happily

803
01:30:51,242 --> 01:30:52,452
Didn't your conscience
ask you even once 

804
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:56,581
That because of you an innocent
boy was declared a criminal

805
01:30:57,874 --> 01:31:00,377
But, but what can
I do?

806
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:04,089
At least you can remove the
blemish from his life

807
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:09,386
By your declaration that he
didn't rape you

808
01:31:10,011 --> 01:31:12,889
He can lead a respectable
life

809
01:31:12,889 --> 01:31:14,974
My husband knows nothing
about it

810
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:17,852
When he comes to know then what
will happen to me?

811
01:31:19,145 --> 01:31:20,355
What'll happen to my name
my family

812
01:31:21,648 --> 01:31:23,775
Nothing will be gained by
shedding tears madam

813
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:29,114
You will have to come with me to
give the statement

814
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:35,120
This is my card. Reach 10 o'clock sharp

815
01:31:39,165 --> 01:31:41,626
You must come
tomorrow

816
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:44,379
Otherwise in the day after
tomorrow's edition 

817
01:31:45,422 --> 01:31:47,882
I will have to publish the story
once again

818
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:50,385
With the photographs

819
01:32:07,944 --> 01:32:10,405
The convict who underwent
4 years of imprisonment

820
01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:14,159
Was he guilty or not innocent
It's a good headline

821
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:15,410
Article is also good

822
01:32:17,954 --> 01:32:20,415
But I will not publish it in
the paper

823
01:32:22,959 --> 01:32:25,420
Because you have written
a fictitious story

824
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:28,006
And only you believe in its
authenticity

825
01:32:29,215 --> 01:32:30,425
Whatever I feel is
the truth

826
01:32:31,718 --> 01:32:33,928
You please publish this
news once

827
01:32:35,472 --> 01:32:37,932
Truth or falsehood will come
to the surface

828
01:32:39,225 --> 01:32:44,189
You think this is a
filtration plant?

829
01:32:45,482 --> 01:32:47,108
You had given me
this case

830
01:32:47,984 --> 01:32:49,736
And when I have reached to
the core of this case

831
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:51,696
You are not prepared to
publish my story

832
01:32:52,989 --> 01:32:55,450
Sir, you'll have to publish
this news, otherwise

833
01:32:56,743 --> 01:32:58,536
Otherwise what'll
you do?

834
01:32:59,245 --> 01:33:02,123
"SUN TIMES" people are prepared to
publish my article

835
01:33:02,999 --> 01:33:06,336
That means you'll get the article
published in my rivals paper

836
01:33:06,753 --> 01:33:08,046
I am helpless

837
01:33:09,255 --> 01:33:11,716
Are you working
for me or 

838
01:33:13,009 --> 01:33:15,470
Don't waste your
and my time

839
01:33:15,553 --> 01:33:17,972
Tell me clearly, are you going to
publish my article or not?

840
01:33:20,517 --> 01:33:23,019
You have probably come
to meet Ritu 

841
01:33:23,019 --> 01:33:24,229
But she isn't in
the house

842
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:27,982
I have come to
meet you

843
01:33:28,608 --> 01:33:29,234
Me

844
01:33:30,527 --> 01:33:33,029
Yes, my name is
Sheetal 

845
01:33:33,029 --> 01:33:35,490
The first time I saw you
was in the hospital

846
01:33:36,116 --> 01:33:39,244
The police had brought you
for the identification

847
01:33:42,372 --> 01:33:45,500
So, it was you, who had
recognized me

848
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:48,003
You are mistaking
me 

849
01:33:49,295 --> 01:33:50,505
That day, even the police
mistook me

850
01:33:51,798 --> 01:33:54,259
I wanted to tell,
that it was not you 

851
01:33:55,552 --> 01:33:58,013
That night... that night was
like a nightmare for me

852
01:33:59,305 --> 01:34:00,640
I started screaming out
of fear 

853
01:34:02,225 --> 01:34:05,520
And the police thought that
you were the criminal

854
01:34:08,064 --> 01:34:10,525
Approximately after 5 days
I regained full consciousness.

855
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:14,279
And I told my father
the entire truth

856
01:34:15,572 --> 01:34:17,782
My father had fixed
my marriage.

857
01:34:19,325 --> 01:34:20,577
One day I even went to
meet the Principal

858
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:21,786
About whom are
you talking?

859
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:25,540
Madam, the boy whom you
have recognized 

860
01:34:26,332 --> 01:34:26,875
He is not among
them.

861
01:34:28,084 --> 01:34:29,294
If you really want to
recognize them 

862
01:34:30,086 --> 01:34:31,796
I will tell you about
them

863
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:36,801
I am prohibited to speak because
of my father 

864
01:34:38,094 --> 01:34:40,555
But you have taken the courage
of speaking

865
01:34:41,848 --> 01:34:43,058
But, the boy whom you have
recognized.

866
01:34:45,602 --> 01:34:46,853
Sheetal, I know it

867
01:34:46,853 --> 01:34:47,354
What?

868
01:34:48,897 --> 01:34:53,193
Yes, because a mother and a father
were helpless to recognize anybody

869
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:56,821
Still I was not even able
to decide 

870
01:34:57,739 --> 01:35:00,283
That the destiny had brought that
boy to stand in front of me

871
01:35:00,617 --> 01:35:02,786
And I told that it
was him

872
01:35:04,954 --> 01:35:06,539
Because like the way you were
helpless because of your father.

873
01:35:08,124 --> 01:35:10,585
Similarly, even I was helpless
because of my daughter 

874
01:35:11,878 --> 01:35:14,339
Those rascals had taken out my
daughter's video cassette

875
01:35:15,256 --> 01:35:19,344
Sheetal, your marriage is going
to take place

876
01:35:20,637 --> 01:35:21,846
But my daughter's marriage has
already taken place 

877
01:35:23,139 --> 01:35:24,391
Had I not done
like that 

878
01:35:24,391 --> 01:35:28,103
They would have ruined my
daughter's happy life

879
01:35:33,149 --> 01:35:36,403
Brother, I want that the blemish
of your disgrace gets washed off.

880
01:35:36,569 --> 01:35:39,364
But I can't help you
in this 

881
01:35:40,657 --> 01:35:44,369
Just think what will happen
to my respect, my family 

882
01:35:45,662 --> 01:35:46,871
Today, that reporter Ritu has
recognized me 

883
01:35:47,872 --> 01:35:50,625
She has come to know about
the truth

884
01:35:51,918 --> 01:35:53,169
She told me.

885
01:35:53,169 --> 01:35:56,589
That tomorrow, in front of the judge
if I don't state your innocence.

886
01:35:58,174 --> 01:36:01,886
Then, she would publish my entire
story again in her newspaper

887
01:36:05,682 --> 01:36:06,224
She is my daughter.

888
01:36:06,933 --> 01:36:08,143
My husband's
heartbeat.

889
01:36:09,436 --> 01:36:10,687
And the mark of
that rape.

890
01:36:10,687 --> 01:36:13,148
Whom he thinks as his own
child and loves her a lot.

891
01:36:15,025 --> 01:36:18,153
And, When he comes to know
that he is not her father.

892
01:36:19,446 --> 01:36:21,906
What will he undergo, what will
happen to this child's future?

893
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:26,911
Brother, I have this little bit
which I can give.

894
01:36:28,204 --> 01:36:30,373
Only you can save me from
this disgrace.

895
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:34,669
Otherwise, I have no other resort
other than to die

896
01:36:40,717 --> 01:36:41,926
Sister, don't cry.

897
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:45,680
You called me, "Brother"
Isn't it

898
01:36:46,973 --> 01:36:47,849
Then, you are like
my Sister.

899
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:53,188
I have lost one sister
of mine.

900
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:55,690
I don't want to lose
the second one

901
01:36:58,234 --> 01:37:00,695
Your father did the right thing
by making you speechless.

902
01:37:01,988 --> 01:37:04,449
Because, the truth had really lost
its value

903
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:08,411
You go home, and forget
everything

904
01:37:10,747 --> 01:37:11,956
Even, Ritu will forget
everything

905
01:37:12,749 --> 01:37:15,710
Whatever you have done for me
I can't repay it back.

906
01:37:17,754 --> 01:37:21,966
But yes, I can definitely tell you
everything about those criminals.

907
01:37:23,343 --> 01:37:25,720
I know everything
about them

908
01:37:40,777 --> 01:37:45,740
The honor, love which you all
have given to me.

909
01:37:48,284 --> 01:37:55,375
For that, I am grateful to all
the Mother's, Sisters and brothers

910
01:37:57,043 --> 01:37:59,504
And I want to tell it
to everyone.

911
01:38:00,797 --> 01:38:03,258
I want to wake up the consciousness
which is asleep.

912
01:38:04,551 --> 01:38:06,219
I want to introduce you to
your own-selves

913
01:38:10,515 --> 01:38:11,057
"The Year of Woman" 

914
01:38:15,812 --> 01:38:17,022
It came and
went off

915
01:38:19,566 --> 01:38:20,108
What happened?

916
01:38:21,776 --> 01:38:22,360
Where is the
woman?

917
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:25,447
She is at the same place, where she was.

918
01:38:28,324 --> 01:38:30,785
This was just a trick of the
Government and the Politicians

919
01:38:32,078 --> 01:38:37,042
To lure the innocent mother's and
sisters and acquire their votes

920
01:38:39,586 --> 01:38:44,549
I don't say that the Govt. doesn't
think about women. It does think.

921
01:38:47,093 --> 01:38:50,472
But it doesn't implement
on it

922
01:38:52,098 --> 01:38:54,559
Look at this.
