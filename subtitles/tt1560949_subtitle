1
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,592
Sir, nowadays..

2
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:42,930
..when everyone thinks of becoming
a doctor or engineer..

3
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:44,526
..why did you choose
to write a novel?

4
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,239
Sir,
where did you write this novel?

5
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:50,504
Punjab -We have heard that you
have not written it yourself.

6
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:53,137
lt is written by someone else.
How true is this statement?

7
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:01,076
Then, who has written this novel?

8
00:03:01,354 --> 00:03:02,514
Sir, l want to ask..

9
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:04,079
One minute, one minute..

10
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:06,523
All your questions will be
answered. Your question please?

11
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,652
Sir, from where did you
get the inspiration..

12
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:10,021
..to write this novel.

13
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:12,687
My inspiration could be anything..

14
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,034
Professor of sociology,
Deedar Singh

15
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,633
Who had been living alone for
25 years in his house..

16
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:20,639
..Chardikala Nivas

17
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:23,039
Or his grandson, Fateh Singh

18
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:25,907
Who came from America
not just to see him..

19
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:29,171
..but also to attend the
marriage of Preet..

20
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:31,443
..the younger sister of his
childhood friend Reet.

21
00:03:31,517 --> 00:03:34,485
Shamsher Singh,
a cunning business man

22
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:37,979
Who is the son of the late
friend of Deedar Singh.

23
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:40,214
Deedar Singh helped
Shamsher Singh..

24
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,725
.. to considerably reduce
the expenses..

25
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,121
..by arranging Preet's marriage
at his own place.

26
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:47,125
Now you must be speculating
which one..

27
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,100
.. of these characters
was my inspiration.

28
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:52,136
That will become clear during
the next seven days..

29
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:53,728
..of marriage celebrations.

30
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,032
One minute, one minute..

31
00:03:57,175 --> 00:04:01,077
l forgot to introduce myself
-Being excited in someone else's..

32
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:02,579
..wedding as if it were your own!

33
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:07,882
Oh no sir,
l am most awaited by all

34
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,920
l am Dev,
childhood friend of Reet and Fateh

35
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,923
We spent our childhood together..

36
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:15,323
..laughing and playing in this
very Chardhikala Nivas

37
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:18,520
That laughter still
rings in my ears.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,399
You are welcome.

39
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,993
Sat Sri Akal, sister.

40
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:27,629
Congratulations on the wedding.

41
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,435
Sat Sri Akal, Darbara Singh ji.

42
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:32,272
lt seems the marriage arrangement
are in full swing.

43
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:35,375
Aunt, l don't see Shamsher
uncle anywhere..

44
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,572
Where is the father
of the bride to be?

45
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,584
He must be here somewhere, busy
with the wedding arrangements.

46
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:43,644
Aunt, have you come from America?

47
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:46,020
Hey girl! Do l look like l
have come from America?

48
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,218
No Gujri, Aunt is from Patiala
and not from America.

49
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:49,988
Hey young girl!
Whom did you address as aunt?

50
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,360
Come, please be seated.

51
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:53,988
Bravo!

52
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:58,332
l presumed that some guy from
Phagwara is fixing the lights..

53
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:02,432
..but you turned out to be my
bosom friend from Philadelphia.

54
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:03,303
O my friend!

55
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,674
lt seems unbelievable that you
are my own friend Fateh.

56
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,513
Wow, my brave friend! How are you?

57
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:13,007
Ten years have gone by,
it is a long period

58
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:15,485
lt seemed that you are desi
only in appearance..

59
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:18,986
..but you are a perfect
Punjabi speaking desi.

60
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,283
Dear friend,
l am tired of speaking English.

61
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:24,485
Now when in Punjab, we will talk
in Punjabi, isn't it Gujri?

62
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:27,429
O yes Uncle,
we will talk in Punjabi

63
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:31,429
Dev, she is my niece, Gujri.
She is here to meet all of you.

64
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:34,062
Sat Sri Akal. -Sat Sri Akal ji.

65
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,605
How is our 'Green chilli'?

66
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,141
Dev!

67
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:43,013
Mr. Hardev, you have come here
to attend my marriage.

68
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:45,079
Only Dev.

69
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:48,209
Hardev, Hardev Malhotra.

70
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,513
Hardev!

71
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:51,214
O Mom, you too have joined them!

72
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:53,449
O, will you just hang
out with the kids?

73
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:55,048
Go and meet Fateh's grandfather..

74
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:56,320
Aunt, you will be able
to meet Grandfather..

75
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:59,089
..only when he is at home.
-After having invited..

76
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,028
.. where has Sardar ji
himself disappeared?

77
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:02,998
Here comes Grand Pa.

78
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:11,174
Pita ji is here.
Let us go and meet him.

79
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,907
Pita ji, Pita ji!

80
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,381
Sat Sri Akal

81
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,281
Look here,

82
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,078
My gift? -Thank you.

83
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:24,587
Pita ji, our gift?

84
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:27,681
Mine too. -Sure.

85
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:32,689
Which one was that?

86
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,955
What is this?

87
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,900
Pita ji, a book?

88
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:41,369
Daughter, continue your studies
after your marriage.

89
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:43,030
Having invited guests
at your place..

90
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:44,631
..where had you disappeared,
Singh Sahib?

91
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,109
You are not our guests.
This is your own home.

92
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,143
Hardev, my son, how are you?

93
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:52,614
l am good.

94
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,947
Hardev, Hardev Malhotra

95
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,318
See, this is not good that
now you join us..

96
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,549
.. only in happiness and grief.

97
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:05,418
Now l am talking like an old man.

98
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:09,022
The truth is, that l am old man.

99
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:11,191
No, Grand Pa.

100
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:13,895
But l can befriend young children.

101
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:19,502
Fateh, my son, your turban
is looking grand.

102
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:20,975
All arrangements finalized, son?

103
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:22,534
Grand Pa,
all set, lights are fixed..

104
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:23,670
..caterer intimated
instructions for..

105
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:26,177
..the car to be decked are given.
-What about the tent?

106
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:27,978
Oh yes, Grand Pa, it is all done

107
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:29,475
Dear son Dev..

108
00:07:29,552 --> 00:07:33,181
..thanks a lot for having spared
some time to be with us.

109
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,286
You have visited us after
a very long time.

110
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,189
lt is good.

111
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:43,256
Darbara singh ji,
what are you doing?

112
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:46,328
Darbara and myself are
together cleaning..

113
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,963
..the layers of dust
from these pictures.

114
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:57,012
They have become hazy with time.

115
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,640
Only if there is some
one to look at them..

116
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:02,112
..we will clean them up.

117
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,646
lsn't it Darbara?

118
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:09,616
Well son,
how is your business doing?

119
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:11,326
Every thing is going fine.

120
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:15,556
l have purchased a pharmaceutical
company. Let us see.

121
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:19,392
l have learnt that land is
cheaper in you area..

122
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,100
..may be l do some business here.

123
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,299
Forget about work.
lt is never ending.

124
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,611
Since now you are
with the family..

125
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:35,280
..it is time to mix up,
eat, drink and enjoy.

126
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:39,180
After all, family is the ultimate
solace for a man..

127
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:41,086
..isn't it brother Darbara?

128
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:58,537
Enough Mr. Singh, enough of it,
as V.C of this university..

129
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:00,370
..l have some responsibilities.

130
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:03,373
l have been getting lots of
complaints against you.

131
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:05,569
You are professor in sociology.
Hmm?

132
00:09:06,148 --> 00:09:07,945
l mean, you have not been
given extension..

133
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:10,211
..after your retirement to play
around with the rules..

134
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:12,082
.. and regulations
of the university.

135
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:16,149
l mean, is there already less
politics in the university..

136
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,317
..so that you have started
leadership classes?

137
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:22,125
Correct, these classes are closely
linked to my subject.

138
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:25,328
See, l am going to be retiring
in some time.

139
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,160
l want to do something
before that.

140
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,227
Give it up Mr. Singh, give it up.

141
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:32,967
Not a single student is willing
to attend your classes.

142
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,633
Does it make any sense? Hmm?

143
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:37,568
But you had promised that you
will sendme some students.

144
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,307
Please help.

145
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,008
You won't give it up, isn't it?

146
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:47,914
l know you well sir.
l have been your student.

147
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,324
Okay Sir, let us do one thing.

148
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:56,090
A few students are a burden
on our university.

149
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,891
There are a few who are rolling..

150
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,024
.. from one department
to the other..

151
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:00,363
..after having failed
for 2-3 years.

152
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:01,697
Others are wasting themselves
in the hostel..

153
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:04,269
.. after having been suspended.
-l will send them to you.

154
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:06,466
No, no. What do you mean?

155
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:09,270
You want me to make future leaders
out of these illiterate..

156
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:11,209
..irresponsible people?

157
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,247
Sir,
what else are leaders made up of?

158
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:16,511
What? That is..

159
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,082
l am just joking, Sir.

160
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:21,019
Moreover, Sir, qualification
is not displayed..

161
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:22,556
.. on their forehead.

162
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:25,616
They are very famous students
of the university.

163
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,524
Others will follow suit.

164
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,154
Thank you. -Sir.

165
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,266
Please hurry up, Aunt.
-Let us go, if it gets dark..

166
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,734
.. we will not be able
to finish any work.

167
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,232
O Son, what are you talking?

168
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,101
We are here to attend
the marriage.

169
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:42,006
lf we don't get decked up. -What
will be our impression on others?

170
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,601
O, where are you taking the
whole gang? -Shopping!

171
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,111
Shopping? That is for girls.

172
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,943
Why are you dragging boys into it?

173
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,573
Now you are entrapped and
can't escape, child.

174
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,118
You are bound to spend a
few hours with them.

175
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:53,210

How to get down?
-Preet, hold my hand.

00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,542
.. and ugly faces..

208
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:37,522
..and a lame Punjab.
Yes, a lame Punjab..

209
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,285
While you fight amongst

..some body else will plunder
Punjab.. yes..

211

00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,493
Just like the mediator monkey

00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,199
..'dama dam mast kalander'

215
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:57,968

Okay l will also leave.

Didi, do tell us the jalebi
related stories of Pita ji.

258
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:06,534

..as Preet didi and
Sartaj Jiju do?

275
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,406
See, God has predestined couples.

276
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,606
lt depends upon their
choice whether..

277
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:54,207
..they meet secretly or openly.

278
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,249
God will definitely unite them..

279
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,185
..if they are ready to be united.

280
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:00,119
l have been ready for
a long time now..

281
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:02,921
..but God doesn't send a
beautiful maiden for me.

She can stay as long

296

Oh yes, not for marriage.
Not at all.

Funny man, it is amazing the

Yes, he makes you laugh..

328
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:26,027
..but how agonized his heart is.

329
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:28,302
First, it was his son,

330
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:30,032
..he does not have
anyone with him.

331

Sorry for that. -All of us have
been very busy because of Preet.

337
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,535
lt had become very difficult
to get her married..

338
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,369
..as she did not like anyone.

339
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:08,136
But she is better than you..

340
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,303
At least she agreed
to get married.

347
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,513
Let us go out for a stroll.

348
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:55,056
Have you an idea about those
that twinkle at night?

349
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:56,954
Give me a break, 'Stars'.

350
00:19:57,025 --> 00:20:02,053
Oh no.. glow worms.. very cute,
friend, very cute.

351
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:05,095
You will get many more ideas too.

352
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:08,463
Sure.

353
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:13,406
Too much load for a delicate girl.

354
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,476
Son, have milk.

355
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,013
Mom, please.

356
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:21,140
Quiet! Finish the whole in one go.

357
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,083
He is a grown up guy..

358
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,585
..who can make him understand
in the presence of guests?

359
00:20:25,654 --> 00:20:27,519
Leave her and take milk.

360
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,219
Diamond is for hundred
thousand and..

361
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:37,026
..hundred twenty five thousand..

362
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:39,158
Please have it.

363
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:41,565
God Himself protects the honour
of the parents of a bride.

364
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,537
Have rasgullas (lndian Sweet)

365
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:45,004
Reet!

366
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,597
Coming.

367
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:51,238
How pretty this girl is!

368
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:55,009
Sister, to tell you the truth,
l did not like it.

369
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:56,741
Shamsher Singh should
have gotten his..

370
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,383
..elder daughter married first..

371
00:20:58,452 --> 00:20:59,976
..as the social system demands.

372
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:01,988
How does it matter to us?

373
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:07,688
Lock has been put on the latch..

374
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:09,462
So could you talk to Reet?

375
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,690
No

376
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,627
She hurt me even before
l could express myself.

377
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:15,225
Sorry.

378
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:17,628
Hey Heer! Oh Heer! Listen!

379
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:20,299
What is this? -Love lorn Ranjha
became an ascetic..

380
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:23,605
..for the sake of your love.
-This is adorable.

381
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:28,314
You are looking very pretty.
-Thank You.

382
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:30,213
What is going on?

383
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:33,909
Friend! l am just trying
to befriend your friend.

384
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:36,081
Why? lf befriending my
friend is going..

385
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:37,715
..to strengthen our friendship?

386
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,653
Why are you trying to confuse me?

387
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:42,059
lt is okay Fateh, he is harmless.

388
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:45,198
Sure, he is harmless.

389
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:49,563
We will know the reality only when
he will hurt your feelings.

390
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,602
Why not? As for hurting feelings,
Reet Kaur is an expert.

391
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:58,043
You are very touchy Fateh.

392
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:00,876
Touchy? -Somebody is come to
see you after so many years.

393
00:22:00,948 --> 00:22:03,542
You should be careful
while teasing him.

394
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:05,175
Give me a break, Fateh.

395
00:22:05,553 --> 00:22:08,579
What did you assume, that you will
come back after ten years..

396
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:10,556
..will have a chit chat with
the girl on the internet..

397
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:13,354
..and if you happen to like the
girl you will marry her?

398
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:16,655
You are confronted with a
Sardarni from Ludhiana!

399
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:22,258
Be careful,
it is not that simple, Fateh.

400
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:26,397
Precisely, it is not that simple.

401
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:33,068
You are looking very pretty.

402
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:35,637
Should l wear this one?
Will it match? -Yes, it will.

403
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:38,115
Magenta color looks grand on you.

404
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:41,353
Reet, Preet is now going to
her own home (in-law's).

405
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:44,289
You should also think about
getting married too.

406
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:47,459
Enough of your TV journalism!

407
00:22:48,962 --> 00:22:50,520
l have told you so
many times that..

408
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,087
..l don't want to get married.

409
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:57,734
Then what should l tell people.
Hmm?

410
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,339
There is something called
public image.

411
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,499
My father is more concerned
about public image rather..

412
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:04,475
..than with my happiness.
-Exactly..

413
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:09,004
..he has always been very
conscious about public opinion.

414
00:23:23,163 --> 00:23:25,563
Mother,
l don't want to get married.

415
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:28,163
Don't worry, daughter..

416
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:33,366
..no one will compel you till
you are mentally ready.

417
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,339
lt is not about being
mentally prepared.

418
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:36,898
When l am happy as such..

419
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,341
..then why should l spoil
another person's life..

420
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:39,708
..by bonding myself with him?

421
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:42,210
lt is not good to talk like this.

422
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:45,113
Don't talk like this my child.

423
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:49,146
Companionship is also very
important in life.

424
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:54,092
And if you get someone to
share your happiness..

425
00:23:55,695 --> 00:24:00,223
..the happiness of life gets
multiplied manifold.

426
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:08,106
Why don't l see that happiness
in the eyes of my mother?

427
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:21,920
Sorry. -Sorry..

428
00:24:21,987 --> 00:24:24,285
..in your country, apology is
expressed in terms of 'Sorry'?

429
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:28,482
l should not have teased
you like that.

430
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:30,354
Right.

431
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,022
You should not have
done it at all.

432
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:35,690
And never mock anyone like that.

433
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:44,102
lt is not necessary that l should
feel the same way you do.

434
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:47,638
You don't like me.

435
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,449
But l have the right to cherish
your desire in my heart.

436
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,256
Hey! Stop!

437
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,330
Dev! Fateh!

438
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:19,905
Dev, some creepy guy tried
to grab me on the stairs.

439
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,605
Oh, ho, marriage activity
is on in the house..

440
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,046
..someone might be looking
for his belongings.

441
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:25,376
Let us sing a song.

442
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:34,687
Look at the ways of the
all-powerful God..

443
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:37,395
..born to their parents..

444
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:41,296
.. daughters are taken
away by others.

445
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:48,497
Look at the ways of the
all-powerful God..

446
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:50,905
..born to their parents..

447
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:54,173
.. daughters are taken
away by others.

448
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,205
Sister..

449
00:25:57,282 --> 00:26:01,217
..just look at Shamsher Singh,
there are tears in his eyes.

450
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:03,213
lt is not easy to get
separated from..

451
00:26:03,287 --> 00:26:05,118
..the one who is very
dear to heart.

452
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,451
Let me tell you one thing,

453
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:08,991
Shamsher Singh will not
cry as much when..

454
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,527
..Preet leaves after her wedding..

455
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:13,154
..as he cried when she was born.

456
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,300
Papa!

457
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:27,471
Yes, my child!

458
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,014
Papa, why did you cry?

459
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,946
Child,
just while listening to that song.

460
00:26:39,023 --> 00:26:44,086
No father,
why did you cry when l was born?

461
00:26:50,701 --> 00:27:00,711
You could bear the burden
of even seven sons.

462
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:03,339
You could bear the burden
of even seven sons.

463
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:14,492
Not even one daughter could
be accepted. Alas!

464
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:17,427
Not even one daughter could
be accepted. Alas!

465
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:33,444
The one who cried a
lot while departing

466
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,103
The one who cried a
lot while departing

467
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:51,561
And even mother could not
console her.. alas!

468
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:52,220
And even mother could not
console her.. alas!

469
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:08,402
The bride is very beautiful,
charming and winsome.

470
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:13,040
We adore you dear daughter..

471
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:19,146
..and will protect you
with our life.

472
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:24,655
Oh bride! Bedecked with chaplet
around his head..

473
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:29,194
..the bridegroom has
come to marry you.

474
00:28:29,265 --> 00:28:34,396
His forehead bedecked with
chaplet, he has come to wed you.

475
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:39,602
He brings eternal happiness,
o bride!

476
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:49,686
The bridegroom is
here to wed you.

477
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,519
The bridegroom is
here to wed you.

478
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:58,149
You are great,
Othe brave daughter of Punjab!

479
00:29:00,263 --> 00:29:02,993
You are great,
O the brave daughter of Punjab!

480
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:08,197
Fond of working on the
spinning wheel..

481
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,306
..you spin pieces of cotton
on the spindle.

482
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,966
The elbows and the wrists
work continuously..

483
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,009
..in the spinning process.

484
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:15,408
A rhythmic sound gets
created when..

485
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:16,604
..the churning stick rotates..

486
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:19,406
With the same rhythm you run fast
while climbing the stairs.

487
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:22,212
You have mirror like purity
and truthfulness..

488
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:31,158
You are great!
O, brave daughter of Punjab!

489
00:29:35,964 --> 00:29:38,330
Only l have managed to spend
my life with you..

490
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,925
..no one else will do that.

491
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:45,203
Only l have managed
to stay with you..

492
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:46,969
..none else would do that.

493
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:49,374
Only l have shared
laughter with you..

494
00:29:49,444 --> 00:29:51,071
..none else will do that.

495
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:53,444
Listen to me right now,
at this very moment..

496
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:56,450
..and find out a solution,
otherwise go away.

497
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:59,112
Only l have shared
laughter with you..

498
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:00,917
..none else will do that.

499
00:30:02,057 --> 00:30:10,226
A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

500
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:12,995
A light-hearted conversation
has led to love.

501
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:21,203
ln the jovial atmosphere,
l too happened to laugh..

502
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:24,006
And then the laughter disappeared
from those lips.

503
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,604
Necklace of tears then
adorned the neck.

504
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:34,555
A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

505
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:43,155
O young man with the red turban!
Listen to what l say..

506
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:52,740
Provide shade of umbrella,
so that l can sit underneath.

507
00:30:53,008 --> 00:30:56,967
A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

508
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,377
Only l have shared
laughter with you..

509
00:30:59,448 --> 00:31:01,040
..none else will do that.

510
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:05,143
A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

511
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,484
Only l have shared
laughter with you..

512
00:31:07,556 --> 00:31:09,148
..none else will do that.

513
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:12,989
A very insignificant thing has
assumed mega proportions.

514
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,255
Only l have shared
laughter with you..

515
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:16,694
..none else will do that.

516
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,968
Can you put this on. -Yes.

517
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:30,034
Sat Sri Akal, Shamsher Singh ji.

518
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:32,674
Come in, Maan sahib.

519
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:38,640
Maan sahib, l want to introduce

lnterested in politics?

533
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:19,290
There is no time for that.

534
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,524
Let it not be politics,
we can talk about business.

535
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:28,133
Dev, Maan sahib is going to
start a very big project.

536
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:31,129
There is no dearth of
money and planning.

00:32:31,505 --> 00:32:36,340
He needs a boy like you to
look after the business.

00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:40,708
..more land to expand
your business.

..which is the foremost
need of our people.

545
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:57,462
Excuse me, l did not get it.

546
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,724
Let it be.

547
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:01,058
We are talking about the real one.

548
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:05,268
l think you are mistaken.

549
00:33:05,538 --> 00:33:07,631
l am not into this
kind of business.

550
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:12,203
Son Dev, where are you going,
just listen to me.

551
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:18,573
Hey, you can show me the styles!

Darbara,

554
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:28,494
Go dear. -Come Dad.

555
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:32,661
Shamsher, you did not introduce
me to your friends.

556
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:35,561
ls it possible that l won't
introduce you to my friends?

557
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:38,263
He is very good friend of mine,
Sukhjinder Maan.

558
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:40,431
You are welcome.

559
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:42,065
Sat Sri Akal.

560
00:33:46,513 --> 00:33:48,708
Sukhjinder Singh Shinda..

561
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:55,518
..M.A Political Science,
94 batch, rusticated twice.

562
00:33:55,722 --> 00:33:57,314
What is he doing here?

563
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,618
To attend the wedding..

564
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:00,488
No, no.

565
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:14,073
The marriage has been performed,
O my father!

566
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:24,083
The marriage has been performed,
O my father!

567
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,448
The marriage has been performed,
O my father!

568
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,653
As Gurmukh l have found the Lord

569
00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:46,060
The darkness of ignorance
has been dispelled.

570
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,472
The Guru has revealed
the blazing..

571
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,947
..light of spiritual wisdom.

572
00:34:58,217 --> 00:35:08,227
My marriage has been performed,
O my father!

573
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:31,416
May God bless you, my daughter!

574
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:35,611
This is how it is here,
don't worry.

575
00:35:36,555 --> 00:35:38,147
But she is crying.

576
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:42,693
You will also cry one day..

577
00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:46,694
..when a handsome guy like me
will marry and take you away.

578
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:49,330
Dev, people cry..

579
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:53,360
..when they leave their near
and dear ones' behind..

580
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:54,462
..l have none.

581
00:35:58,443 --> 00:36:02,641
Certainly, now there is
somebody in your life.

582
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:06,345
lf you abandon him
he will cry a lot.

583
00:36:07,452 --> 00:36:09,920
You will look very funny crying.

584
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:33,576
Go, daughter.

585
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,907
No child, don't cry.
What else do you want..

586
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:41,474
..your sister is married in a good
family, don't cry, come..

587
00:36:41,552 --> 00:36:45,318
..he will keep her happy,
come my daughter.

588
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:57,523
lf you don't realize,
you will be wiped out..

589
00:36:57,602 --> 00:36:59,900
..O the natives of Hindustan!

590
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:08,845
One owl is good enough
to bring destruction..

591
00:37:08,913 --> 00:37:11,245
..to the beautiful garden..

592
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:13,647
And when each one of the branches
has an owl perched on it.

593
00:37:13,884 --> 00:37:18,048
l wonder what will be the
fate of that garden!

594
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:35,299
This is very good.

595
00:37:35,573 --> 00:37:41,409
Okay, which is your favourite
latest TV serial ?

596
00:37:41,612 --> 00:37:43,603
Bolo tara.. ra.. ra

597
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:49,011
Which is the latest Hindi
film being screened?

598
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:51,247
Sir, we live in Punjab,
it will be good..

599
00:37:51,322 --> 00:37:55,520
..if you talk about a Punjabi
film. -Sir, Munde UK De

600
00:37:56,494 --> 00:37:59,895
Who is the captain of the
Cricket team of lndia?

601
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:01,898
Leave it Sir,
what sort of question is this?

602
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:03,558
Dhoni ji Dhoni.

603
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:07,300
How many rivers are there
in our Punjab?

604
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,869
Sir,
what type of question is this?

605
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:13,908
Sir, 'Five waters' naturally
means, there are five rivers.

606
00:38:13,977 --> 00:38:16,275
Ravi, Beas and Satluj are there..

607
00:38:16,346 --> 00:38:18,109
..and the rest two
are those that..

608
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:19,876
..flow at the back of your house?

609
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:25,946
How many educated persons
are there in our Punjab?

610
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:28,657
Sir, you are unnecessary indulging
in calculations.

611
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:30,654
We are all educated.

612
00:38:33,096 --> 00:38:36,497
Okay, what qualities should
a good leader possess?

613
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:41,000
What qualities? Eat,
drink and be merry, that's it.

614
00:38:41,271 --> 00:38:42,670
lsn't it friends?

615
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:47,468
This year is sweet,
who has seen the next?

616
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:53,379
Name a good leader.

617
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,441
Here he is, our Ranjeeta.

618
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,184
Ranjeet Singh,
village Gurdaspur, age 28 years..

619
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:04,155
..has been here in the
same university..

620
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:05,558
..for the last seven years..

621
00:39:05,628 --> 00:39:07,357
..quite a progress!

622
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:12,459
There once was one Maharaja Ranjit
Singh of Punjab and..

623
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:18,636
..here today is one our
dear Ranjit Singh ji..

624
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:27,108
..local youth leader,
representative of all students.

625
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,983
A leader should set an example.

626
00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:35,381
Those who are not themselves
disciplined, don't keep time..

627
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,553
..how can they teach discipline
to others?

628
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,653
What example will they set
for others to follow?

629
00:39:41,898 --> 00:39:44,924
What is happening to
our Punjabi youth?

630
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:48,336
They watch 'Singh is King' and
assume themselves to be kings.

631
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:50,030
lndia wins the cricket match..

632
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:53,040
..they set off fireworks and
assume themselves to be Dhoni

633
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:58,309
You need to have substance,
substance within..

634
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,277
.. to be a leader.

635
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:07,087
Ranjit Singh ji,
this hollow leadership..

636
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,181
..and this hollow show
off is of no use.

637
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,199
'Hollow leadership'!

638
00:40:22,104 --> 00:40:24,265
l will teach you a lesson
about leadership.

639
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:52,398
Sir, are you okay? -Sir, how dare
they, l will see to them.

640
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:54,594
No, no, l am fine.
lt is all right.

641
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,736
Farid, do not turn around and..

642
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,937
..strike those who strike
you with their fist..

643
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:03,876
Kiss their feet and return
to your own home.

644
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:08,005
Preet, can you please hand over
the jewellery box to me.

645
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:13,985
What happened?

646
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,387
Nothing.

647
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:18,453
Missing her?

648
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:22,028
Missing? Me or you?

649
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,158
Mind is a very peculiar thing..

650
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:35,375
Sometimes it soars high in the
sky and at times falls flat..

651
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:41,607
At times it says 'No' and at
other times says 'Yes'..

652
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,686
One should always listen
to its voice.

653
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:57,029
lf your mind tries to tell you
something, do listen to it.

654
00:41:58,032 --> 00:42:00,899
There is no harm.

655
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:06,664
And there should be no hesitation
in changing your opinion.

656
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:18,008
There is no peace..

657
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,253
..no sleep..

658
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:38,039
There is no peace, no sleep..

659
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:42,703
There is no peace, no sleep..

660
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:50,240
For one who treads
the path of love

661
00:42:50,484 --> 00:43:00,494
One who falls in love,
cries and appeals

662
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,191
One who falls in love,
cries and appeals

663
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:10,903
lt becomes matter of life and..

664
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:18,374
..death and he understands
nothing

665
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:28,455
One who falls in love,
cries and appeals.

666
00:43:28,455 --> 00:43:33,222
One who falls in love,
cries and appeals.

667
00:43:33,293 --> 00:43:37,593
Preet Didi is already married,
now it is Reet Didi's turn.

668
00:43:37,664 --> 00:43:40,462
No, no, Uncle (Fateh) will
get married first.

669
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:42,160
To Simran.

670
00:43:42,235 --> 00:43:44,066
They are good friends.

671
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:46,605
Both of them are from
America and..

672
00:43:46,673 --> 00:43:51,337
..the marriage proposal
is being talked about.

673
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:53,174
Okay.

674
00:43:58,184 --> 00:44:04,589
The path of love is
full of sorrows

675
00:44:05,158 --> 00:44:11,427
One must tread it cautiously.

676
00:44:12,098 --> 00:44:18,628
Even at the peak of noon,
there appears pitch darkness

677
00:44:19,172 --> 00:44:24,633
One must tread it cautiously.

678
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:26,971
Simran Didi, these are my toys..

679
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:29,242
..l will take them from
you when l come there.

680
00:44:29,315 --> 00:44:31,476
Okay. l will deliver the
toys at your place.

681
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:34,384
Gujri, this one is from me.

682
00:44:34,521 --> 00:44:37,354
Oh yes, now you will stay
at Fateh's place.

683
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,654
What do you mean?

684
00:44:40,393 --> 00:44:42,293
l mean,
both of you are getting married.

685
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:45,695
Getting married?
Are you crazy? What do you mean?

686
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,394
l am sorry, Simran.

687
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:51,699
Come here!
Are you out of your mind?

688
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,571
Yes, l am, Fateh.
l had a high opinion of you..

689
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:58,234
..but what kind of person you
have turned out to be?

690
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:03,340
As soon as l turned you down,
you found a new girl, right?

691
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:07,552
lt is true though, there is no
dearth of girls for you..

692
00:45:08,954 --> 00:45:12,913
..if not this one,
another will do.

693
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:14,856
Why are you feeling so bad?

694
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:17,322
You did not have any
feelings for me.

695
00:45:17,663 --> 00:45:21,224
And then for how long, how long
could l have waited for you?

696
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:24,027
lt is my life.
l want to move on in my life.

697
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:36,905
Look at your face.

698
00:45:39,585 --> 00:45:40,984
Fateh!

699
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:47,289
You know,
some people never change.

700
00:45:48,694 --> 00:45:51,686
They keep on waiting
for the time..'

701
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,694
'..when 'No' will
change into 'Yes'

702
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:07,068
Did you enjoy the story?

703
00:46:07,246 --> 00:46:09,339
Now, you tell me..
the king first..

704
00:46:09,414 --> 00:46:11,382
Pita ji, answer my query first.

705
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,644
Please ask.

706
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:15,352
Pita ji,
tell me where is Philadelphia?

707
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:21,186
Oh son, around us, there..

708
00:46:21,426 --> 00:46:26,386
..is no village by this name.

709
00:46:26,632 --> 00:46:30,159
Pita ji, it is not a village where
we have cows and buffaloes.

710
00:46:30,235 --> 00:46:35,537
lt is a beautiful city from where
Fateh Singh ji has come.

711
00:46:35,607 --> 00:46:37,507
There it is.

712
00:46:37,676 --> 00:46:43,272
Oh Nihal Singh ji,
Oh Nihal Singh ji..

713
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:47,509
..you drink the milk of Punjab's
cows and buffaloes..

714
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:50,950
..and sing praises of America?

715
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:56,618
Sir, what am l hearing?

716
00:46:56,994 --> 00:46:59,292
l am fine.

717
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:03,000
lt is okay, Sir.
But Sir, you know..

718
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:05,399
..that if this incident
comes in the news..

719
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:08,233
..it will not be good for the
image of the University.

720
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,273
Balbir Singh, while l am not
bothered even about my life..

721
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:18,504
..you are concerned about the
image of the university?

722
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:21,143
Please help me..

723
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:23,380
..you just grant me a period of
two or three more months..

724
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:25,649
Sir, You know that who
has attacked you?

725
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:33,392
You will have to be very
cautious of this boy..

726
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:36,058
.. lf you hurt his ego he won't..

727
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:38,601
..let you be there for long, Sir.

728
00:47:41,672 --> 00:47:49,204
Sat Sri Akal ji.

729
00:47:55,686 --> 00:48:01,056
The battle drum beats in
the sky of the mind,

730
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:11,135
Aim is taken and the
wound is inflicted.

731
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:11,931
Aim is taken and the
wound is inflicted.

732
00:48:12,003 --> 00:48:17,100
The spiritual warrior enters
the field of battle,

733
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:23,238
Now is the time to fight!
-Oh friend..

734
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:24,645
..what is this, you woke me
up so early in the morning.

735
00:48:24,882 --> 00:48:26,508
Dev, it is Gurpurub time..

736
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,244
..l want to see all celebrations.

737
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:30,946
That is why l am here.
You know that?

738
00:48:31,321 --> 00:48:32,583
Don't you have any interest?

739
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:34,419
l have interest.

740
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:36,652
Look here,
what have l brought for you.

741
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:40,121
Cover your head, if go you must.

742
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:46,195
He alone is known as
the spiritual hero..

743
00:48:46,269 --> 00:48:49,238
..who fights in defence of faith.

744
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:59,316
He may be cut, piece-by-piece.

745
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:00,010
He may be cut, piece-by-piece.

746
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,381
He may be cut..

747
00:49:02,452 --> 00:49:11,952
..piece-by-piece, but he never
quits the field of battle.

748
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:31,414
Waheguru..
Waheguru.. Waheguru.. Waheguru..

749
00:49:31,414 --> 00:49:32,073
Waheguru..
Waheguru.. Waheguru.. Waheguru..

750
00:49:32,148 --> 00:49:37,142
First, accept death and give
up any hope of life.

751
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:47,230
Become the dust of
the feet of all.

752
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:50,495
Become the dust of
the feet of all.

753
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:59,305
Then you may come to Me.

754
00:50:29,204 --> 00:50:30,364
What do you want from me?

755
00:50:30,439 --> 00:50:34,000
Stop! Stop! Stop it.

756
00:50:34,543 --> 00:50:36,636
What do you want from me?

757
00:50:36,979 --> 00:50:41,609
Stop. lt is my bag.

758
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:46,618
Don't worry so much, child.

759
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:54,228
l have never been so terrified
in my entire life.

760
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:56,425
l don't know what did
he want from me.

761
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:58,363
Why he was chasing me.

762
00:51:00,669 --> 00:51:04,070
Anyways, l got some good shots.

763
00:51:04,973 --> 00:51:07,237
These pictures are so pretty.

764
00:51:09,077 --> 00:51:12,945
l lost my favourite bag.

765
00:51:13,982 --> 00:51:18,385
Had l lost my camera, all my
memories would have got lost.

766
00:51:19,455 --> 00:51:21,582
Camera is not dearer
than you girl!

767
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:28,286
l had given up all hope of
happiness in my family.

768
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:32,025
Life had been moving mechanically.

769
00:51:32,401 --> 00:51:35,996
But you are here now,
take care of yourself.

770
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:41,508
You are the first girl with whom
l have seen my son happy.

771
00:51:42,544 --> 00:51:44,569
l can't see him sad.

772
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:51,011
Hello! -Yes Sir. Sat Sri Akal.

773
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:53,246
How far have you talked
about it yet?

774
00:52:53,714 --> 00:52:56,945
Could you manage to
talk to Dev or not?

775
00:53:00,021 --> 00:53:04,321
Gurjeet,
Gurjeet, just for a minute.

776
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:13,158
Speak out Killia.

777
00:53:13,234 --> 00:53:18,001
Sir, it was your idea.
You have to accomplish it.

778
00:53:18,272 --> 00:53:21,571
Moreover,
Sir, transactions of land..

779
00:53:21,642 --> 00:53:23,633
.. and the process
of commissioning..

780
00:53:23,878 --> 00:53:25,573
..of factories is time consuming.

781
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:27,910
See, l am already working on it.

782
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:32,009
ln fact, l want to kill two
birds with one stone.

783
00:53:32,987 --> 00:53:34,682
You should be ready.

784
00:53:35,656 --> 00:53:38,351
As for Dev, l will make him
pester Deedar Singh.

785
00:53:38,525 --> 00:53:41,119
l am the right hand of Maan sahib.

786
00:53:41,328 --> 00:53:43,990
Sir,
now elections are approaching.

787
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:46,232
Money is needed for campaigning.

788
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:50,568
We have to find out ways
and means to arrange it.

789
00:53:51,972 --> 00:53:54,964
Be careful and observant..

790
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:58,676
..lest the enemy should be there
within your household.

791
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,034
Come here children,
first take Parshaad..

792
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:25,094
..and then keep on playing.
-Parshaad!

793
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:27,036
Uncle, this morning you
have offered Parshad..

794
00:54:27,107 --> 00:54:29,132
..what is the happy occasion?

795
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:33,373
Today is my grandson,
Darshan's birthday.

796
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:52,989
Listen,
Listen, all and one listen..

797
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,101
..commoners as well as the
selected ones listen..

798
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,901
..old as well as the young listen,

799
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:04,601
Oh voters as well as
the leaders listen..

800
00:55:04,944 --> 00:55:08,903
.. all those holding the pen
and the sympathizers listen.

801
00:55:08,982 --> 00:55:12,281
Oh Almighty! You too listen:

802
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:15,185
The sixth river of drugs is rising
high up to the waist..

803
00:55:15,255 --> 00:55:18,156
.. higher still it is going
above the shoulders.

804
00:55:18,224 --> 00:55:21,249
lt is about to bring destruction
to countless homes.

805
00:55:21,326 --> 00:55:23,988
Please find out some solution..

806
00:55:24,063 --> 00:55:27,157
..some remedy to save
the situation.

807
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,027
What is he doing?

808
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,427
Well done, well done!

809
00:55:31,503 --> 00:55:33,232
Why do you want to get
hit by my vehicle?

810
00:55:33,972 --> 00:55:40,502
The death which scares people,
gives me pleasure.

811
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:44,080
Well done! Well done!

812
00:55:49,421 --> 00:55:51,412
Fateh,l will be back after
inquiring about Darshan.

813
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:53,023
Fine.

814
00:56:21,453 --> 00:56:24,320
Darshan,
somebody is here to see you.

815
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:44,898
Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

816
00:56:50,082 --> 00:57:00,092
Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

817
00:57:00,092 --> 00:57:08,556
Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

818
00:57:08,866 --> 00:57:18,876
You act and incite others
to act and then deny it.

819
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:24,007
You act and incite others
to act and then deny it.

820
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:34,391
The Lord is always with you.
He sees and hears everything.

821
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:43,629
Bravo! Be more forceful.

822
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:45,665
Let the swing go still higher!
Go on, Darshan!

823
00:57:45,903 --> 00:57:47,598
Go on Darshan, still higher!

824
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:51,167
Further! Still Further!

825
00:57:54,278 --> 00:57:55,472
Darshan.

826
00:57:58,549 --> 00:58:01,575
What kind of treatment is this?

827
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:03,309
What type of treatment
do you provide?

828
00:58:03,387 --> 00:58:04,945
lf you have any alternative
treatment..

829
00:58:05,022 --> 00:58:07,923
..then take him back home and
get the treatment done.

830
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:13,224
Darshan, let us go home.

831
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,259
Home?

832
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:22,034
You are in love with
your enemies..

833
00:58:22,106 --> 00:58:28,602
..while you renounce true friends.

834
00:58:28,846 --> 00:58:30,438
Did you get chance to see Darshan?

835
00:58:30,514 --> 00:58:33,347
Shall we go now or you have to
spend the whole day here?

836
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:36,143
Let us go!

837
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:44,650
Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

838
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:49,258
Just a minute,
l have an important call.

839
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:59,643
Waheguru! Waheguru!

840
00:58:59,643 --> 00:59:01,975
Waheguru! Waheguru!

841
00:59:02,045 --> 00:59:07,415
Waheguru!

842
00:59:08,518 --> 00:59:09,610
Dev!

843
00:59:09,886 --> 00:59:10,944
Yes.

844
00:59:12,088 --> 00:59:13,851
lt does not make any
difference to you?

845
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:16,255
What do you mean?

846
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,021
Our childhood friend got
shattered like this..

847
00:59:22,132 --> 00:59:24,066
He is in such a bad condition..

848
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:29,060
lt never occurred to you
that you could help him?

849
00:59:29,973 --> 00:59:32,635
Wish you had given
him timely help..

850
00:59:34,544 --> 00:59:36,512
..so many years have
passed by and..

851
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:38,376
..you never went to see him once?

852
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:41,413
Even your father did
not come to see..

853
00:59:41,484 --> 00:59:43,179
..your Grandpa for
all these years.

854
00:59:46,423 --> 00:59:50,120
Very good Fateh Singh,
sounds good to give sermons..

855
00:59:50,894 --> 00:59:53,419
.. after returning from a foreign
country once in a blue moon!

856
00:59:54,998 --> 00:59:56,659
Stay here Fateh Singh and
see for yourself..

857
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,162
..you will come across so..

858
00:59:58,234 --> 01:00:00,498
Many Darshans every day
that even agony..

859
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,333
..and pain will get benumbed.

860
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:24,225
Sat Sri Akal, Dadaji

861
01:00:24,294 --> 01:00:28,856
Sat Sri Akal ji, may you live
long! -What are you doing here?

862
01:00:28,932 --> 01:00:31,627
We had come to see your class.
-There was nothing to be seen.

863
01:00:31,867 --> 01:00:36,327
How is the class going on?

864
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:38,568
ln fact, it is a difficult task

865
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,470
l mean..

866
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:43,341
..the modern boys and girls come
to the university to enjoy..

867
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:47,507
.. and have fun and not to attend
such a serious class.

868
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:50,508
How will they understand the
purpose of your class?

869
01:00:50,586 --> 01:00:51,450
l don't think so.

870
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,581
l agree, it is difficult,
not impossible though.

871
01:00:56,291 --> 01:01:02,355
Grandpa, tell me one thing,
why is this frame empty?

872
01:01:09,638 --> 01:01:13,267
Son, you tell me whose picture
should be put up here?

873
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:21,848
ls there any one to match
their greatness?

874
01:01:24,086 --> 01:01:30,025
Any role model, any leader..

875
01:01:30,092 --> 01:01:33,619
..who can inspire us
to emulate him?

876
01:01:35,564 --> 01:01:37,191
There have been many leaders..

877
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:39,496
..but no one had compassion
for this land.

878
01:01:40,269 --> 01:01:42,134
Whoever came was selfish.

879
01:01:43,472 --> 01:01:45,633
Lest this frame should
remain empty..

880
01:01:46,241 --> 01:01:48,368
..that is the whole purpose
of this endeavor.

881
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:56,617
Are you busy?

882
01:01:57,486 --> 01:01:59,113
Not for you.

883
01:01:59,188 --> 01:02:01,088
What are you trying to find?

884
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:05,920
Something meaningful about the
place you live and breath in..

885
01:02:05,994 --> 01:02:09,862
Punjab. -All l hear and see
is Punjabi music and dance.

886
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:12,992
What is the problem with dancing?

887
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:17,962
O The Sixth River,
'Chhevan Dariya' ..

888
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:21,238
Land of five rivers -Punjab..

889
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:24,107
and then which is the Sixth River?

890
01:02:24,178 --> 01:02:25,907
Oh! You will find out soon enough.

891
01:02:26,314 --> 01:02:28,305
Why do you keep me guessing?

892
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:31,518
Life itself is a riddle
just like you!

893
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:38,415
May be l am a riddle.. solve it.

894
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:41,087
Oh, wait.

895
01:02:41,629 --> 01:02:44,029
Punjab,
the land of five rivers became

896
01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:46,225
The forerunner of the
Green Revolution.

897
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:50,198
Green fields of this
land never let the..

898
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:53,365
..basket of lndia go without food.

899
01:02:53,441 --> 01:02:57,002
But today, the Punjab scenario
is very painful.

900
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:59,508
Our farmers committing suicide,
our youth sunk in addiction..

901
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:04,574
.. our new generation being
the target of AlDS ..

902
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:08,847
All this has posed a big question
mark in front of us..

903
01:03:08,923 --> 01:03:11,824
why all this?
-This is what l call meaningful.

904
01:03:11,893 --> 01:03:13,326
lt is a huge help.

905
01:03:13,828 --> 01:03:15,887
l can help you too.

906
01:03:16,364 --> 01:03:17,854
Really?

907
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:21,525
Let us go out in the open,
under the sky..

908
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:24,062
..where you will get
many more new ideas.

909
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,266
So,
finally l got a response from you.

910
01:03:30,178 --> 01:03:32,373
There is a lot of response.

911
01:03:33,047 --> 01:03:36,983
Okay, tell me what happened to
the Green Revolution in..

912
01:03:37,185 --> 01:03:39,016
..the state of Punjab?

913
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:45,158
A lot has changed,
you did not notice it.

914
01:03:46,227 --> 01:03:48,855
Who is responsible for
the farmer's suicide?

915
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:52,998
Tell me, is it the Water level,
some defective policies..

916
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:57,128
..the farmers themselves somehow
or the drug abuse?

917
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:01,371
There is a lot of intoxication.

918
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:05,410
Come,
let me answer all your queries.

919
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:11,245
My love exists only for you
and follows your path.

920
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:14,082
Don't desert me ..

921
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:19,592
l have given up the whole world
having reposed trust.

922
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,426
And hope in you ..

923
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:28,595
All my warmth of love for you.

924
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:34,431
The inroads to my heart
are only for you.

925
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:38,034
So you tell me l am the only
one you want to be with now.

926
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:40,136
So, what about it?

927
01:04:40,213 --> 01:04:43,842
And you feel that my love you
just cannot live without.

928
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,942
Yeah, think about it.

929
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:49,011
And you tell me that my heart
is a lovers work of art.

930
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:52,058
You love my lovely lips and
l love your finger tips.

931
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:53,217
What is all this craziness?

932
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:54,988
We are on this earth
just once like this

933
01:04:55,061 --> 01:05:03,526
Don't you know we have
just one life to live!

934
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:11,373
l dream of you alone.

935
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:14,038
After having seen you..

936
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:17,948
..my gaze became oblivious
of the world.

937
01:05:20,487 --> 01:05:26,016
l dream of you alone.

938
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:28,193
After having seen you..

939
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:31,560
..my gaze became oblivious
of the world.

940
01:05:32,098 --> 01:05:37,832
l saw you as my destination.

941
01:05:37,904 --> 01:05:43,170
l follow in your footsteps.

942
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:49,278
You are my faith, my hope.

943
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:54,843
All warmth of love for you.

944
01:05:55,087 --> 01:06:01,219
The inroads to my heart
are only for you.

945
01:06:04,096 --> 01:06:06,997
Keep carefully the
silver anklets..

946
01:06:07,066 --> 01:06:09,899
..and yellow scarf my
fair sister-in law.

947
01:06:12,571 --> 01:06:15,404
Keep carefully the
silver anklets..

948
01:06:15,474 --> 01:06:18,375
..and yellow scarf,
my fair sister-in law.

949
01:06:18,444 --> 01:06:20,878
The anklets of the young
maidens inflamed..

950
01:06:20,946 --> 01:06:22,379
..the passion of young boys.

951
01:06:22,815 --> 01:06:31,587
The anklets of the young maiden
kept on beckoning ..

952
01:06:39,064 --> 01:06:40,258
So much fun!

953
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:41,822
Ya!

954
01:06:44,002 --> 01:06:46,835
Woo! Woo!

955
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:51,333
Hello!

956
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:52,877
What is the news?

957
01:06:53,178 --> 01:06:54,907
No good news, Sir.
-Why, What happened?

958
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:59,041
Max, a foreign company's proposal
has been approved.

959
01:07:01,954 --> 01:07:03,421
Sir, are you listening?

960
01:07:03,622 --> 01:07:05,613
They are going to establish
the firm here itself.

961
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:10,919
But don't worry, Sir.
How can an outsider excel us?

962
01:07:11,096 --> 01:07:14,031
Moreover, you have already planned
to start a new business.

963
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:15,896
There is no harm in it.

964
01:07:20,973 --> 01:07:22,099
What happened?

965
01:07:22,574 --> 01:07:27,101
A lot has happened and its
solution has to be found.

966
01:07:30,148 --> 01:07:32,013
You have wasted your
life in slumber.

967
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:33,573
Your spinning wheel is
without a strand.

968
01:07:33,818 --> 01:07:35,285
What will you do while your
dowry is not ready.

969
01:07:35,353 --> 01:07:36,945
Wake up, don't keep on snoring!

970
01:07:37,021 --> 01:07:39,421
This laid back attitude
does not behoove you.

971
01:07:42,493 --> 01:07:44,256
Concentrate, Himmat.

972
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:47,224
Where are you focused?

973
01:07:47,598 --> 01:07:51,364
At me,
at the ball or somewhere else?

974
01:07:54,005 --> 01:07:57,270
A leader can reach his
destination only..

975
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:59,969
..if he is focused on the track.

976
01:08:00,878 --> 01:08:02,345
Do you understand?

977
01:08:02,613 --> 01:08:05,309
Sir, what destination are
you proposing for us?

978
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,917
This is a very good question.

979
01:08:11,823 --> 01:08:15,190
Come along.
-You must be thinking that while..

980
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:16,453
..l had been teaching sociology..

981
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:19,052
.. for the last 30 years,
now what is the purpose..

982
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,927
..of these leadership classes.

983
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:23,193
My colleagues say..

984
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:27,533
..Brother Deedar Singh,
all those who are idle..

985
01:08:27,772 --> 01:08:30,104
.. and worthless will
automatically become leaders.

986
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:35,069
But when the things
go beyond control..

987
01:08:36,013 --> 01:08:38,573
..and there seems no guardian
of this land.

988
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:41,581
When the torch bearers themselves
barter the land..

989
01:08:41,853 --> 01:08:45,949
..for their own benefit,
then you should know..

990
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,181
.. that this is the
opportune time to..

991
01:08:48,259 --> 01:08:50,124
..make leaders from
this very land.

992
01:08:53,097 --> 01:08:56,225
Every year elections are
held in this university.

993
01:08:57,301 --> 01:09:00,134
Many students win these elections.

994
01:09:00,505 --> 01:09:05,875
How many of them contest
the state elections?

995
01:09:05,943 --> 01:09:13,144
Sir, they get deflated here only.

996
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,078
My purpose is clear.

997
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:22,219
l want you to come forward..

998
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:26,226
..and become enlightened,
intelligent, educated..

999
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:29,857
.. qualified and unblemished
leaders.

1000
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,802
By pointing at corruption
repeatedly..

1001
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,031
..you can't do away with it.

1002
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:39,940
You have to be in the system
to beat the system.

1003
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:43,574
Mere words will not
achieve anything.

1004
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,478
l have seen people changing.

1005
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:52,250
lf you have courage,
zeal and clear vision..

1006
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:54,454
..then you will definitely
achieve your goal.

1007
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:58,991
But you have to be clear
about your goal.

1008
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:03,061
This is how battle in
the field is won.

1009
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:06,597
Right Ranjit?

1010
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,567
Where did you get stuck up, Fateh?

1011
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:16,072
l don't know that whether you
are an old man of 25 years..

1012
01:10:16,146 --> 01:10:18,341
..or l am a young man of 60.

1013
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:20,275
Come on! Join me.

1014
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:23,615
What happened to the nourishing
food you had in America?

1015
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:29,554
Grandpa, finally, some students
did come for the class.

1016
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,456
lt takes some time.

1017
01:10:33,263 --> 01:10:36,061
Moreover, you have taken up
a very challenging task.

1018
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,833
Fateh,
every body does the easy task.

1019
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:42,901
But Grandpa, you always preferred
the tedious paths.

1020
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,201
After 84, all of us went abroad..

1021
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:51,576
..you were alone for 25 years.

1022
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,280
Loneliness never perturbs me.

1023
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:59,143
But even Dad never came
back to see you.

1024
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,556
Yes,
he never came back even once to..

1025
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:06,060
..meet me during the
last 25 years.

1026
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,563
lt did not hurt me.

1027
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,961
Every individual has his
own compulsions..

1028
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,333
..has one's own troubles.

1029
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:18,503
But you have come to see me, son.

1030
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:23,969
Even that has a motive, Grandpa.

1031
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:31,251
He wants that the deal for your
land should get finalized..

1032
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,019
Because..

1033
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,224
Because after my death
there will..

1034
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:42,161
..be no one to look after my land?

1035
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:48,402
One doesn't get such
a paradise anywhere.

1036
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,039
One cannot get it.

1037
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:56,902
Ripe wheat crop and
sweet smell of..

1038
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,574
..the fully blooming paddy crop!

1039
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:06,645
How will l breathe without that?

1040
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:09,853
The surging sea of mustard
flowers gives..

1041
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,361
.. that a father gets on seeing
the progress of his son.

1042
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,898
What happened, Grandpa?

1043
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,577
The government wants to
acquire our land..

1044
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,476
..that stretches across for miles.

1045
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:38,418
What should l tell
them that my own..

1046
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:41,319
..blood too intends
to do the same?

1047
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:58,470
Dev, what are you looking
at early in the morning?

1048
01:13:00,074 --> 01:13:04,101
Nothing Uncle, had just been
looking at Pitaji's fields.

1049
01:13:05,379 --> 01:13:09,247
Oh, l envision grapevines
stretched across this land..

1050
01:13:10,318 --> 01:13:12,115
..and a factory in the middle.

1051
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:13,581
Factory?

1052
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:20,591
Yes, not local, we will
make English liquor.

1053
01:13:22,897 --> 01:13:26,230
Local company and English liquor!

1054
01:13:27,602 --> 01:13:29,399
lt is an excellent opportunity.

1055
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:33,796
This village will be just
the starting point.

1056
01:13:35,276 --> 01:13:40,009
Gradually, in every city H &
M Distillery will be famous.

1057
01:13:41,115 --> 01:13:43,879
Distillery , why Distillery.

1058
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:48,448
Dev,
nowadays every nook and corner..

1059
01:13:48,523 --> 01:13:52,050
..of Punjab has a liquor shop.

1060
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:55,487
lt has become a very flourishing
business, boy.

1061
01:13:57,365 --> 01:14:00,994
Otherwise also, Maan Sahib
is contesting elections.

1062
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:03,903
When Elections are contested
and won..

1063
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:07,107
..then liquor shops naturally
come up. lsn't it?

1064
01:14:07,508 --> 01:14:10,773
And when distilleries are started,
many people get employment.

1065
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:12,039
Think about it!

1066
01:14:14,015 --> 01:14:16,540
lt is a bit difficult
task for Maan Sahib..

1067
01:14:16,784 --> 01:14:18,547
..but for you, it is very easy.

1068
01:14:19,587 --> 01:14:23,147
Dev, you know it very well,
that in this village..

1069
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:26,386
..and in the surrounding
villages..

1070
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:28,984
..Deedar Singh owns
the maximum land.

1071
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:35,399
lf we talk to him about the land,
things will be easier.

1072
01:14:36,937 --> 01:14:39,804
Otherwise also,
he treats you as his own son.

1073
01:14:39,873 --> 01:14:40,999
He loves you a lot.

1074
01:14:41,808 --> 01:14:45,437
He won't refuse you.
You should talk to him. Hmm?

1075
01:14:56,289 --> 01:14:59,884
How? How dare you?

1076
01:15:02,362 --> 01:15:06,162
How dare you talk like that?

1077
01:15:10,103 --> 01:15:14,130
lf l had to sell my land, l would
have sold it 25 years back..

1078
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:17,836
..and joined my son in America.

1079
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:21,212
And now, Fateh and myself
would have come here..

1080
01:15:21,281 --> 01:15:23,181
..to attend Preet's wedding.

1081
01:15:25,952 --> 01:15:28,420
This land is still worth
a gold mine..

1082
01:15:30,023 --> 01:15:32,389
.. only if the young
and hard working..

1083
01:15:32,459 --> 01:15:34,324
..sons of the farmer toil it.

1084
01:15:35,195 --> 01:15:38,187
But the real tragedy is
that the young sons..

1085
01:15:38,265 --> 01:15:40,495
..have severed themselves
from this land.

1086
01:15:55,448 --> 01:15:59,612
Hardev, you can utilize this
land as per your desire.

1087
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:05,019
But in future, no one will talk
about the sale of my land.

1088
01:16:06,992 --> 01:16:12,931
l won't sell my land.
l cannot sell it.

1089
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:19,098
Fateh and yourself
together can do..

1090
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:21,571
..whatever you wish to
do in these fields.

1091
01:16:22,141 --> 01:16:24,302
l am not that fortunate.

1092
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:27,038
Oh no Friend, you just tell
me what do you want to do.

1093
01:16:27,246 --> 01:16:28,975
l am on your side.

1094
01:16:29,048 --> 01:16:30,948
How are you with me, Fateh?

1095
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:34,282
You live in America.

1096
01:16:34,353 --> 01:16:35,081
Moreover..

1097
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:37,588
..by staying here for two or four
months one can't do business.

1098
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:42,190
Hardev,
there are things beyond business.

1099
01:16:42,795 --> 01:16:45,229
This business and money and
everything else will be left here.

1100
01:16:46,065 --> 01:16:47,930
And so will these fields..

1101
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:13,355
Why do you wander in
delusion like this..

1102
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:28,841
Why do you wander in
delusion like this..

1103
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:37,306
Why do you wander in
delusion like this..

1104
01:17:39,018 --> 01:17:40,178
Fateh!

1105
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:47,453
Fateh! You felt bad?

1106
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:54,098
l am sorry, Fateh.

1107
01:17:54,432 --> 01:17:55,524
You felt bad today..

1108
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,467
..because whatever happened
was in your presence.

1109
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:01,104
But what about the things
that happened..

1110
01:18:01,172 --> 01:18:02,503
..to Grandpa in your absence?

1111
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:08,809
Dev's words hurt you so much.

1112
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,473
What about the agonies
Grandpa must..

1113
01:18:11,549 --> 01:18:13,847
..have experienced
all these years..

1114
01:18:16,054 --> 01:18:18,784
..whose echoes never
reached your ears?

1115
01:18:20,558 --> 01:18:23,550
How can a person be
so stonehearted..

1116
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:26,394
..that he did not come
back even once..

1117
01:18:26,464 --> 01:18:28,455
..to see his father in 25 years?

1118
01:18:31,002 --> 01:18:33,527
What was uncle's compulsion,
Fateh?

1119
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:39,933
Fateh! Sometimes age old
wounds get healed just..

1120
01:18:40,945 --> 01:18:45,575
.. by a touch and at times..

1121
01:19:15,113 --> 01:19:16,341
Dad!

1122
01:19:16,481 --> 01:19:18,244
Hi Fateh! How are you?

1123
01:19:18,983 --> 01:19:20,280
l am good.

1124
01:19:20,485 --> 01:19:24,421
Dad,
l am not coming back next week.

1125
01:19:24,789 --> 01:19:26,484
Yes, l know next week..

1126
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:29,521
What did you say,
you are not coming back next week?

1127
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:31,453
Yes.

1128
01:19:32,028 --> 01:19:33,552
Then, when are you coming back?

1129
01:19:34,498 --> 01:19:36,193
After six months.

1130
01:19:36,266 --> 01:19:39,201
We had sent you to lndia
to sell our land..

1131
01:19:39,269 --> 01:19:41,237
..does it take so much time?

1132
01:19:41,304 --> 01:19:44,034
Dad, l am not selling any land.

1133
01:19:44,107 --> 01:19:46,075
Did the old man..

1134
01:19:46,309 --> 01:19:48,072
Grandpa did not say
anything to me.

1135
01:19:48,145 --> 01:19:49,840
l don't want to listen to
anything in this regard.

1136
01:19:49,913 --> 01:19:52,939
l want to see you here next week.

1137
01:19:53,016 --> 01:19:55,507
Sorry, Dad! -By the way, what
do you want to accomplish..

1138
01:19:55,585 --> 01:19:57,177
..by staying there for six months?

1139
01:19:57,254 --> 01:20:03,557
May be l can sow a seed..
someday something will grow.

1140
01:20:27,117 --> 01:20:29,585
ln fact Dev, Deedar Singh should
not have talked like that.

1141
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:33,981
But, maybe he had some compulsion.

1142
01:20:38,094 --> 01:20:43,532
With years of hard work,
l set up a great empire..

1143
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:46,332
..without anyone's help.

1144
01:20:48,038 --> 01:20:52,532
For so many years after father's
death no one inquired..

1145
01:20:53,009 --> 01:20:54,636
..whether l was alive or dead.

1146
01:20:56,213 --> 01:20:59,876
l did not have any guardian.
l did not have any importance.

1147
01:21:01,484 --> 01:21:04,419
And now when everything
was going on fine..

1148
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:07,412
..those companies from abroad..

1149
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:13,395
.. dashed all my hopes and on
the other hand my own people,

1150
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:17,363
Oh yes, my own people are
not ready to help me out.

1151
01:21:20,336 --> 01:21:25,000
Don't worry.
God will surely guide you through.

1152
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:29,033
lf Deedar Singh doesn't agree
to sell off his land..

1153
01:21:29,912 --> 01:21:31,971
.. we will get his land
acquired and..

1154
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:34,038
..will definitely achieve
our goals.

1155
01:21:35,818 --> 01:21:37,251
You are on my side, isn't it?

1156
01:21:38,988 --> 01:21:41,183
You will see that in
times to come..

1157
01:21:42,057 --> 01:21:47,518
H & M Company will be famous
in every city. l assure you.

1158
01:22:02,144 --> 01:22:05,307
How are you Dev?
You don't look good Dev.

1159
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:09,039
Why, what is wrong with me.
l am perfectly okay.

1160
01:22:09,118 --> 01:22:10,585
That's rude now.

1161
01:22:10,953 --> 01:22:12,818
Yes, l am rude.

1162
01:22:13,522 --> 01:22:15,353
l am, what l am.

1163
01:22:15,991 --> 01:22:18,152
You are not going to live the
whole of your life with me.

1164
01:22:18,227 --> 01:22:19,387
What? Dev!

1165
01:22:19,461 --> 01:22:20,860
Nothing.

1166
01:22:22,598 --> 01:22:24,930
Tell me, what is wrong.

1167
01:22:25,334 --> 01:22:26,892
What happened?

1168
01:22:27,403 --> 01:22:28,836
Talk to me.

1169
01:22:28,904 --> 01:22:32,340
l am a businessman,
a successful one.

1170
01:22:33,142 --> 01:22:35,076
l intend to start a new business.

1171
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:39,145
But no one understands me here
-all of them misunderstand me.

1172
01:22:39,581 --> 01:22:40,946
That doesn't matter.

1173
01:22:41,016 --> 01:22:44,179
l know just one thing,
if you are doing the right thing..

1174
01:22:44,253 --> 01:22:46,187
..then nothing is difficult.

1175
01:22:46,255 --> 01:22:51,158
Right thing? What wrong am
l doing? What do you mean?

1176
01:22:52,361 --> 01:22:55,057
From the CEO of a pharmaceutical
company..

1177
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:56,961
..to the CEO of a Distillery.

1178
01:22:57,266 --> 01:22:59,062
What a transformation, Dev?

1179
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:01,869
On one hand pharmaceutical
companies..

1180
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:03,597
..and on the other
hand distillery.

1181
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,235
What a contrast?

1182
01:23:05,306 --> 01:23:08,332
This is also a business! lf l
don't do it, somebody else will.

1183
01:23:08,409 --> 01:23:11,071
Why do you want to be
responsible for it?

1184
01:23:11,145 --> 01:23:12,806
Look at the difference
between what..

1185
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,347
..l am doing and what
you are doing?

1186
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:21,187
The Sixth River.

1187
01:23:22,523 --> 01:23:24,855
What is this Sixth River you
are talking about girl?

1188
01:23:25,526 --> 01:23:28,290
Punjab, the land of Five Rivers.

1189
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:33,426
And the Sixth River of Punjabis..
Punjabis like you, Dev.

1190
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:37,867
You are trying to poison this
river by helping people..

1191
01:23:37,939 --> 01:23:39,372
..with the distilleries.

1192
01:23:39,607 --> 01:23:42,303
First,
the agriculture, then the youth..

1193
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,276
..what more will alcohol consume?

1194
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,072
Has not Punjab had enough?

1195
01:23:47,148 --> 01:23:51,380
Enough Carrie enough!
l have had enough of this Carrie.

1196
01:24:02,563 --> 01:24:09,298
Shamsher, what you are talking
about is difficult for us.

1197
01:24:10,972 --> 01:24:13,167
Jagbir,
nothing is difficult for you.

1198
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:15,570
Friend, you are an MLA. Moreover..

1199
01:24:15,943 --> 01:24:18,104
..the issue with us is
of great importance.

1200
01:24:19,113 --> 01:24:21,911
Look here, if you propose to
the Government to acquire..

1201
01:24:21,983 --> 01:24:26,044
..Deedar Singh's land it will
benefit the people around.

1202
01:24:26,487 --> 01:24:28,785
The unemployed will
get employment..

1203
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:30,983
..and you will get
applause for it.

1204
01:24:32,927 --> 01:24:34,394
Come here Himmat!

1205
01:24:35,329 --> 01:24:38,127
l have heard that nowadays
you are..

1206
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:40,963
..attending Deedar
Singh's classes..

1207
01:24:42,002 --> 01:24:43,936
You spend a lot of time there.

1208
01:24:44,604 --> 01:24:49,303
Be careful, lest it should have
a negative impact on you.

1209
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:53,471
Okay, Jagbir, l leave now.
Will call you later.

1210
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:55,071
Okay.

1211
01:25:00,353 --> 01:25:01,615
Yes, is everybody ready?

1212
01:25:01,855 --> 01:25:03,015
Yes, Sir.

1213
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:04,951
Absolutely? -Yes Sir.

1214
01:25:05,025 --> 01:25:06,515
Strong hands? -Yes Sir.

1215
01:25:06,593 --> 01:25:08,493
Full determination? -Yes Sir.

1216
01:25:08,995 --> 01:25:13,329
See, this exercise is imperative
for teamwork.

1217
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:17,102
Today you will come to have
trust for each other.

1218
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:20,071
lf you have build the trust today,
it will be there forever.

1219
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:23,202
Do you trust them? -Yes Sir.

1220
01:25:23,276 --> 01:25:26,245
They are your friends,
your fellows, okay?

1221
01:25:27,047 --> 01:25:29,948
Yes, Rana, go!

1222
01:25:33,887 --> 01:25:35,548
Good! Next.

1223
01:25:36,857 --> 01:25:38,381
Very good!

1224
01:25:38,558 --> 01:25:40,048
Next.

1225
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,087
Very good!

1226
01:25:51,204 --> 01:25:56,938
Himmat, what have you done?
You have betrayed his faith.

1227
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:01,175
lt is essential to have
trust in a leader.

1228
01:26:01,815 --> 01:26:05,615
Do you think that now Angad will
ever be able to trust you?

1229
01:26:07,053 --> 01:26:09,214
This is the problem
with our country.

1230
01:26:10,156 --> 01:26:12,920
Our leaders commit
gross mistakes..

1231
01:26:12,993 --> 01:26:15,052
..for which people have
to pay a heavy price.

1232
01:26:16,196 --> 01:26:20,963
lt is very necessary for a
leader to be trustworthy.

1233
01:26:21,768 --> 01:26:26,568
Trust?
ln you Sir? How can we trust you?

1234
01:26:27,006 --> 01:26:30,533
You sermonise about leadership
here in the University.

1235
01:26:31,143 --> 01:26:33,509
But l am really sorry to say,
Sir..

1236
01:26:33,579 --> 01:26:35,274
..do you yourself practice
what you..

1237
01:26:35,347 --> 01:26:37,076
..preach in your leadership
lectures?

1238
01:26:38,284 --> 01:26:41,776
l don't get it boy,
what are you trying to say?

1239
01:26:42,154 --> 01:26:45,453
Sir, why won't a leader wish that
his people should have jobs?

1240
01:26:46,025 --> 01:26:50,519
Sir, you told us that a good
leader is never selfish.

1241
01:26:50,596 --> 01:26:53,895
He always thinks of the
welfare of his people.

1242
01:26:53,966 --> 01:26:55,263
He can't be selfish.

1243
01:26:55,534 --> 01:26:58,503
Then, Sir, how is it that
a person like you..

1244
01:26:58,571 --> 01:27:02,007
..who talks at length about
leadership, could go wrong?

1245
01:27:02,207 --> 01:27:04,107
How can we trust you, Sir?

1246
01:27:04,176 --> 01:27:05,837
Hey, what are you saying?

1247
01:27:05,911 --> 01:27:09,347
Doesn't matter.
Son, what are you trying to say?

1248
01:27:09,415 --> 01:27:10,939
Feel free to speak openly.

1249
01:27:11,016 --> 01:27:12,881
Sir, if, for the welfare of
people, someone wants..

1250
01:27:12,952 --> 01:27:15,978
..to purchase your land
to build a factory..

1251
01:27:16,055 --> 01:27:18,546
..wants to provide employment
to the people in your area..

1252
01:27:18,824 --> 01:27:20,451
..what is wrong with that?

1253
01:27:20,526 --> 01:27:22,551
What kind of factory?

1254
01:27:22,795 --> 01:27:24,558
lt can be for any product?

1255
01:27:24,797 --> 01:27:27,994
What kind of factory?

1256
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:31,935
l agree, it is a distillery,
a liquor factory.

1257
01:27:32,004 --> 01:27:33,972
But just think that
how many people..

1258
01:27:34,039 --> 01:27:35,563
..are going to benefit from it?

1259
01:27:35,808 --> 01:27:37,935
How many people are going to get
livelihood because of it?

1260
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:40,570
For the benefit of a few hundred,
should..

1261
01:27:40,813 --> 01:27:42,212
.. we sow the seeds
of destruction..

1262
01:27:42,281 --> 01:27:43,805
..of hundred thousands of homes?

1263
01:27:47,886 --> 01:27:50,980
Good, very good, sounds good.

1264
01:27:51,457 --> 01:27:56,190
A person who is visiting from a
foreign land is talking great!

1265
01:27:57,997 --> 01:28:01,262
You just tell me your purpose.

1266
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:04,431
ls your concern to get the liquor
shops of Punjab closed..

1267
01:28:04,503 --> 01:28:06,937
..or do you want to stop only this
distillery from coming up?

1268
01:28:09,907 --> 01:28:14,173
Sir, you were talking about
forming our party..

1269
01:28:14,345 --> 01:28:15,903
..why don't you make it?

1270
01:28:16,914 --> 01:28:20,406
But tell me from where will we
get money for the elections?

1271
01:28:24,055 --> 01:28:26,751
What do you think Fateh Singh ji..

1272
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:29,017
..from where does the money
for the elections come?

1273
01:28:29,093 --> 01:28:31,027
This game is not easy.

1274
01:28:31,329 --> 01:28:37,097
lt is a river of fire,
you will have to dive into it.

1275
01:28:37,468 --> 01:28:40,164
Fateh ji, you should persuade
your Grandpa to agree..

1276
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:44,106
.. for the sale of the land-it
will benefit everybody.

1277
01:28:44,308 --> 01:28:47,175
Money can be managed
and elections..

1278
01:28:47,245 --> 01:28:49,839
..too can be contested and won.

1279
01:28:51,849 --> 01:28:56,047
My friend Ranjit,
you are very lucky.

1280
01:28:56,854 --> 01:28:58,845
You got the opportunity
to live on this land.

1281
01:29:00,058 --> 01:29:06,588
Even l was born here, but
livelihood was destined elsewhere.

1282
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:16,531
Punjab is the land of five rivers,
and the Sixth River..

1283
01:29:17,408 --> 01:29:19,876
..for the Sixth River you
have to make a choice.

1284
01:29:20,912 --> 01:29:24,040
This river gives life,
doesn't destroy it.

1285
01:29:25,149 --> 01:29:27,811
The decision rests with you,
whether you yourself ..

1286
01:29:27,885 --> 01:29:29,318
..become the Sixth River..

1287
01:29:29,387 --> 01:29:31,787
.. and infuse life in Punjab,
the land of The Gurus..

1288
01:29:31,856 --> 01:29:34,120
..or let it be doomed to death
in the river of intoxicants!

1289
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:37,019
The onus lies on you.

1290
01:29:40,264 --> 01:29:42,061
lntentions shape up desires.

1291
01:29:42,133 --> 01:29:43,930
They have to be strengthened
with fortitude,

1292
01:29:44,202 --> 01:29:47,569
So that they flow uninterrupted
despite obstructions!

1293
01:29:48,072 --> 01:29:51,041
lf a person starts his work
with determination..

1294
01:29:51,109 --> 01:29:52,302
..'Chatrik' says..

1295
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:55,105
..that even God cannot stop his
from the fruits of hard labor.

1296
01:30:45,095 --> 01:30:48,030
Oh my God! You scared me!

1297
01:30:48,498 --> 01:30:50,398
l thought you were a brave girl!

1298
01:30:50,467 --> 01:30:51,525
That l am!

1299
01:30:51,601 --> 01:30:53,626
Are you not scared of anyone?

1300
01:30:54,604 --> 01:30:56,868
Forget it!
How do you like it here?

1301
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:59,636
Thank you so much for letting
me stay with you.

1302
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:01,537
lt is always my pleasure.

1303
01:31:01,611 --> 01:31:05,012
So someone has fallen in love,
it seems. Hmm?

1304
01:31:05,415 --> 01:31:07,975
Falling in love is
thing of the past.

1305
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:09,848
lt is better to be in love.

1306
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,220
That is cool. So you know what
you are doing, right?

1307
01:31:14,591 --> 01:31:16,058
Fateh, l like Dev.

1308
01:31:16,126 --> 01:31:19,584
He is a good boy.
l will be fine. Don't worry.

1309
01:31:20,597 --> 01:31:22,360
lf you can make up your mind..

1310
01:31:22,432 --> 01:31:25,060
..for someone you haven't
seen for ten years..

1311
01:31:25,302 --> 01:31:27,964
.. well Dev and l have spent
some time together.

1312
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:30,263
Even if he has some
of his faults..

1313
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:33,605
..isn't love all about accepting
people as they are?

1314
01:31:34,044 --> 01:31:38,343
That is right. You know,
if you feel that the person..

1315
01:31:38,614 --> 01:31:44,109
..you love is going astray then
you should point it out.

1316
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,385
That's real test of love.

1317
01:32:00,069 --> 01:32:01,969
Sat Sri Akal, Brother!

1318
01:32:02,037 --> 01:32:02,969
Come Killa..

1319
01:32:03,038 --> 01:32:05,199
..you are here again to irritate
me with your idle talk!

1320
01:32:05,274 --> 01:32:08,971
Sir, it is high time to drink
milk and eat coagulated milk.

1321
01:32:09,211 --> 01:32:14,843
Sir, l have heard that
you have met the MLA?

1322
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:18,015
Then sir, it will become very
interesting -But be careful..

1323
01:32:18,087 --> 01:32:21,284
..there are many people around
you to fail your scheme.

1324
01:32:22,024 --> 01:32:24,993
Moreover,
brother, your idea is grand..

1325
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:28,527
..cocaine in the guise of liquor!

1326
01:32:28,597 --> 01:32:32,055
Moreover, now Dev is with us too!

1327
01:32:32,468 --> 01:32:33,901
lt will be very interesting.

1328
01:32:33,969 --> 01:32:38,030
lt means brother,
we will eat the cake..

1329
01:32:38,107 --> 01:32:40,598
..and have it too.
lt will be very enjoyable!

1330
01:32:40,976 --> 01:32:44,207
Killia, Killia, you are an idiot.

1331
01:32:45,481 --> 01:32:47,847
How many times l have told you
to tone down your voice.

1332
01:32:49,018 --> 01:32:52,419
lf someone hears it,
you will be buried alive.

1333
01:32:52,888 --> 01:32:57,086
Oh Sir, no one can harm us here.

1334
01:32:57,259 --> 01:32:59,853
Moreover, we are doing something
good, nothing bad.

1335
01:32:59,929 --> 01:33:03,456
See, here the farmer is
distressed, the youth is unhappy..

1336
01:33:03,532 --> 01:33:04,829
.. there is no employment..

1337
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:06,925
..and people don't get
much from agriculture.

1338
01:33:07,002 --> 01:33:09,493
lf at this time of sorrow..

1339
01:33:09,571 --> 01:33:13,530
..we offer them some
wine and poppy husk.

1340
01:33:13,776 --> 01:33:15,573
We are certainly not
doing any harm.

1341
01:33:15,811 --> 01:33:17,244
We are doing them good, Sir!

1342
01:33:19,014 --> 01:33:24,246
O Killia, these things are not
as easy as they seem to be..

1343
01:33:26,487 --> 01:33:28,887
..but Shamsher Singh will
definitely do it.

1344
01:33:49,077 --> 01:33:51,068
l don't know what
is American Date?

1345
01:33:54,382 --> 01:33:56,612
How many people do you think are
involved in this business?

1346
01:33:56,951 --> 01:33:58,578
lt is a full-fledged mafia.

1347
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:00,185
This is what l have heard.

1348
01:34:00,888 --> 01:34:04,289
But l had no idea that they
were hiding in our house.

1349
01:34:05,026 --> 01:34:08,052
They smuggle drugs under
the cover of alcohol..

1350
01:34:08,129 --> 01:34:09,892
..and make them available
in every village.

1351
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:13,326
l could never imagine that Dev
will be party to this..

1352
01:34:14,135 --> 01:34:18,868
.. our own Dev,
my childhood friend.

1353
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:21,832
This is how he has reciprocated
to my friendship?

1354
01:34:22,477 --> 01:34:24,172
lf someone listens to this story..

1355
01:34:24,245 --> 01:34:26,236
..then no body will ever
trust one's friend.

1356
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:31,216
He told me that he wanted
to do business.

1357
01:34:31,886 --> 01:34:34,377
l was going to ask Grandpa
to give his land to him.

1358
01:34:35,089 --> 01:34:36,556
He is our own fellow.

1359
01:34:37,592 --> 01:34:40,857
Such a great betrayal?
Such a big plan?

1360
01:34:41,329 --> 01:34:44,025
lt will be a liquor shop
dealing in drugs.

1361
01:34:44,265 --> 01:34:48,463
We may be mistaken.
We should talk to Dev.

1362
01:34:48,836 --> 01:34:51,066
There is no need to tell or
ask anything from anyone.

1363
01:34:51,372 --> 01:34:53,306
l will see to it that how
he does this business?

1364
01:34:53,541 --> 01:34:56,476
Fateh, if you too get enraged
and confront him in anger..

1365
01:34:56,544 --> 01:35:00,310
..then what is the difference
between you and him?

1366
01:35:00,548 --> 01:35:04,449
Moreover, just think, if
educated people like you

1367
01:35:04,951 --> 01:35:08,910
And your father go abroad
and don't look back..

1368
01:35:08,989 --> 01:35:12,254
.. then how easy it would
be for the enemies..

1369
01:35:12,325 --> 01:35:16,159
..to weaken the roots of this
land by poisoning our youth.

1370
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:21,333
lt is nobody else's fault,
Fateh, but our own.

1371
01:35:22,335 --> 01:35:25,327
lt is our home,
and we have to take care of it.

1372
01:35:25,572 --> 01:35:27,472
Then what should l do?

1373
01:35:28,208 --> 01:35:31,803
Along a small line,
draw a bigger one.

1374
01:35:53,934 --> 01:35:57,802
A person judges others
by his own parameters.

1375
01:35:57,871 --> 01:35:59,532
How wrong l had been!

1376
01:36:00,006 --> 01:36:05,137
You are right, Fateh. Perhaps
this is our biggest mistake.

1377
01:36:05,312 --> 01:36:07,872
Moreover, how can one human
being be like the other?

1378
01:36:08,348 --> 01:36:10,543
You are the resident of
a developed country..

1379
01:36:11,084 --> 01:36:13,848
..whereas we are the humble
natives of a very small country.

1380
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,549
Don't twist the matter.
l am talking about your plans.

1381
01:36:18,291 --> 01:36:22,125
What were you lacking that you
indulged in such activities?

1382
01:36:22,562 --> 01:36:23,859
Do you need.. ?

1383
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:26,490
Just a minute Fateh! Don't talk
with me in this language..

1384
01:36:26,566 --> 01:36:29,364
..as if to oblige me. l hate it.

1385
01:36:30,403 --> 01:36:32,268
l don't need anything from you.

1386
01:36:32,339 --> 01:36:34,204
l only thought about the land..

1387
01:36:34,274 --> 01:36:36,367
How dare you think that we..

1388
01:36:36,443 --> 01:36:39,173
What is wrong with it?
lt is a business?

1389
01:36:39,412 --> 01:36:41,107
You are also a businessman.

1390
01:36:41,448 --> 01:36:42,506
And a man like you..

1391
01:36:42,582 --> 01:36:45,073
..whose father left his father
here for 25 years..

1392
01:36:45,152 --> 01:36:48,143
..for the sake of his business .

1393
01:36:50,456 --> 01:36:53,084
lt is not a big deal! l am only..

1394
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:53,921
lt is not an understatement that..

1395
01:36:53,993 --> 01:36:55,984
..he can even sell off his father.
-Dev!

1396
01:36:58,364 --> 01:37:01,265
That which exists seems bitter.

1397
01:37:01,333 --> 01:37:06,168
That which does not exist
seems sweet to you.

1398
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,131
The whole situation seemed
to be plotting against me.

1399
01:37:10,209 --> 01:37:12,177
l had no idea about
the conspiracy..

1400
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:17,781
.. that the enemy had been
planning to execute through me.

1401
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:22,110
My own people were unaware
of the fact..

1402
01:37:22,188 --> 01:37:25,055
..that l had no role to
play in this scheme.

1403
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:39,271
Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

1404
01:37:39,271 --> 01:37:47,872
Why do you wander in
delusion like this?

1405
01:37:53,319 --> 01:37:58,222
Carrie!

1406
01:37:59,391 --> 01:38:04,590
Oh, now you don't have any time
even to respond to my hello?

1407
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,461
Hello!

1408
01:38:09,969 --> 01:38:15,032
l had presented you something.
You haven't valued it.

1409
01:38:16,508 --> 01:38:18,305
You haven't valued it at all!

1410
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:23,546
l am going to the city for a day..

1411
01:38:23,782 --> 01:38:26,945
..will you accompany me or not?

1412
01:38:32,357 --> 01:38:33,915
l am asking you something.

1413
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,927
l told you l am busy.

1414
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:41,091
So are you.
Are you not doing strange jobs?

1415
01:38:42,934 --> 01:38:45,494
Okay,
all this attitude because of..

1416
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:48,061
..my conflict with your friend!

1417
01:38:48,873 --> 01:38:51,398
And now you are repeating
his words!

1418
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,540
What about our friendship?

1419
01:39:06,524 --> 01:39:07,889
Dev.

1420
01:39:09,427 --> 01:39:11,156
Who are these people you
are working with?

1421
01:39:11,229 --> 01:39:12,355
Why?

1422
01:39:13,064 --> 01:39:17,228
They don't seem to be right people
to me. -Do you trust me? Then..

1423
01:39:18,836 --> 01:39:23,034
You don't have time for me.
We can talk.

1424
01:39:23,408 --> 01:39:26,844
So the bottom line is that you
wanted to teach me a lesson.

1425
01:39:27,278 --> 01:39:31,408
Don't do it to me again, never.
l love you, damn it!

1426
01:39:33,518 --> 01:39:37,079
You are welcome to this special
Punjab program. -Today..

1427
01:39:37,155 --> 01:39:40,215
..we will introduce you to the
Punjabis, the natives of Punjab.

1428
01:39:40,391 --> 01:39:42,188
Do you know that where, in lndia..

1429
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:44,490
..are the maximum HlV
positive cases..

1430
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:46,393
..caused by intravenous drugs?

1431
01:39:46,464 --> 01:39:48,091
l know, Mumbai.

1432
01:39:48,433 --> 01:39:50,367
You will be surprised to know..

1433
01:39:50,435 --> 01:39:52,926
..that in one of the cities of
your own Punjab, Amritsar..

1434
01:39:53,004 --> 01:39:55,438
..there are maximum number
of HlV cases.

1435
01:39:55,506 --> 01:39:57,030
Tell me the reason.

1436
01:39:57,108 --> 01:39:59,008
My son is suffering because
of intravenous drugs.

1437
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:01,978
We are helpless. -He went to
the city and got addicted.

1438
01:40:02,046 --> 01:40:03,570
Now we are paying the price.

1439
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:07,509
Hello!

1440
01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:11,885
Hello, how far have you succeeded
in the mission?

1441
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:13,813
You are very slow.

1442
01:40:13,957 --> 01:40:18,189
Sir, you have to contest the
elections and win as well.

1443
01:40:18,562 --> 01:40:22,020
Moreover, Sir, how will you
fulfill people's dreams..

1444
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:23,794
..when you have not
been able to get..

1445
01:40:23,867 --> 01:40:25,061
..the liquor factories started?

1446
01:40:25,135 --> 01:40:28,901
Sir, only if we bribe people
with food and liquor..

1447
01:40:28,972 --> 01:40:32,601
..then they will vote
in our favor.

1448
01:40:32,843 --> 01:40:34,367
Moreover, the rest of the
game is being spoiled..

1449
01:40:34,444 --> 01:40:36,139
..by your daughter on the TV.

1450
01:40:36,213 --> 01:40:37,840
Sir,
she is your daughter and you..

1451
01:40:37,914 --> 01:40:39,313
..are responsible for her deeds.

1452
01:40:39,383 --> 01:40:42,011
Just switch on your TV and see.

1453
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:49,359
Who is responsible for the present
condition of Punjab?

1454
01:40:49,526 --> 01:40:51,892
Don't forget to see,
tomorrow, at this very time..

1455
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:54,362
..the last episode of 'Punjab
Special Program'.

1456
01:40:54,431 --> 01:40:56,524
Ms. Carol Smith, from America..

1457
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:59,467
..our special guest of the day
will talk on this subject.

1458
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:04,437
Killa, tell Maan Sahib that
it won't take us long..

1459
01:41:04,508 --> 01:41:08,467
..to reach the desired goal.
Believe me.

1460
01:41:08,879 --> 01:41:11,848
We have full faith in you,
Shamsher Singh ji.

1461
01:41:12,082 --> 01:41:14,983
Father! Which destination
is being talked about?

1462
01:41:15,952 --> 01:41:17,977
Mind your own business.

1463
01:41:20,190 --> 01:41:21,555
Where are you going?

1464
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,089
Studio.

1465
01:41:25,295 --> 01:41:27,058
You will not step out
of this house.

1466
01:41:29,433 --> 01:41:32,527
Why father!
You can't do this to me.

1467
01:41:32,936 --> 01:41:34,597
l am your father.

1468
01:41:35,372 --> 01:41:36,964
Enough of this drama!

1469
01:41:37,974 --> 01:41:40,408
From now you will not talk
about any leader..

1470
01:41:40,477 --> 01:41:42,604
..or politician of Punjab
on the channel.

1471
01:41:43,079 --> 01:41:44,512
Do you understand?

1472
01:41:44,581 --> 01:41:48,176
l am to contest the elections,
if you continue like this..

1473
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:49,275
..then no party will give me the..

1474
01:41:49,352 --> 01:41:50,410
..ticket to contest the elections.

1475
01:41:50,487 --> 01:41:52,546
Father! l have always obeyed you.

1476
01:41:52,889 --> 01:41:55,619
During the last five days you have
stopped me from everything.

1477
01:41:56,092 --> 01:41:58,252
Don't talk about 84,
it is controversial..

1478
01:41:58,327 --> 01:42:00,158
..don't touch the topic
of hypocrite Babas..

1479
01:42:00,229 --> 01:42:01,355
..how do they harm you?

1480
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:04,126
Don't talk about farmer's suicide,
why are you bothered?

1481
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,293
Don't talk about drugs.

1482
01:42:06,368 --> 01:42:10,134
Why can't l talk about drugs,
Papa? Why?

1483
01:42:10,473 --> 01:42:13,237
l should talk only about giddha,
bhangra, makki di roti..

1484
01:42:13,309 --> 01:42:15,277
..and sarson da saag?

1485
01:42:16,579 --> 01:42:18,012
Why don't you speak?

1486
01:42:18,814 --> 01:42:21,840
Why should l be quiet so
that no one comes..

1487
01:42:21,917 --> 01:42:23,578
..to know about your misdeeds..

1488
01:42:23,819 --> 01:42:26,413
.. and one more corrupt leader
wins people's votes..

1489
01:42:26,489 --> 01:42:28,548
..by bribing them with drugs?

1490
01:42:29,258 --> 01:42:30,555
Reet!

1491
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:38,799
You would have borne the burden
of even seven sons..

1492
01:42:38,868 --> 01:42:42,133
Were you not content with
slapping my womb?

1493
01:42:42,204 --> 01:42:43,330
Gurjit!

1494
01:42:45,574 --> 01:42:51,274
You killed three daughters
in my womb, Sardar ji.

1495
01:42:52,882 --> 01:42:55,180
Then you did not even let me cry.

1496
01:42:56,185 --> 01:43:03,216
And now if you kill my grown up
daughter, l won't keep quiet.

1497
01:43:05,294 --> 01:43:07,524
No, l won't be quiet.

1498
01:43:08,163 --> 01:43:16,502
The one who went away crying
while departing..

1499
01:43:16,572 --> 01:43:20,235
-Move ahead, Reet.

1500
01:43:21,544 --> 01:43:31,554
Not even mother could
console her.

1501
01:43:31,554 --> 01:43:32,020
Not even mother could
console her.

1502
01:43:46,467 --> 01:43:47,593
Reet!

1503
01:43:52,307 --> 01:43:56,141
Waiting for the sun
with tearful eyes?

1504
01:44:01,983 --> 01:44:05,111
Light emerges out of darkness,
Reet.

1505
01:44:06,421 --> 01:44:09,219
Have courage. l am with you.

1506
01:44:14,562 --> 01:44:17,759
Wake up! Wake up!

1507
01:44:18,032 --> 01:44:20,762
Let not the night pass
away in slumber.

1508
01:44:20,835 --> 01:44:24,498
There is not going to
be another chance..

1509
01:44:24,572 --> 01:44:27,336
..to enjoy the bounties here.

1510
01:44:27,575 --> 01:44:31,238
Wake up! Wake up!

1511
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:04,244
Dev!

1512
01:45:06,948 --> 01:45:08,279
Should l raise the curtains?

1513
01:45:08,349 --> 01:45:09,907
No.

1514
01:45:10,785 --> 01:45:12,309
You like to be in the dark now?

1515
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:14,447
Yes, that is my problem.

1516
01:45:16,124 --> 01:45:17,557
Why are you doing this?

1517
01:45:20,194 --> 01:45:21,388
What have l done?

1518
01:45:22,363 --> 01:45:24,354
You are teaming up with
the wrong people.

1519
01:45:25,966 --> 01:45:28,230
l don't need your lecture.

1520
01:45:30,871 --> 01:45:33,237
lf you don't approve,
you can go back and leave me here.

1521
01:45:35,375 --> 01:45:37,309
Otherwise also,
it is the nature of white girls..

1522
01:45:38,211 --> 01:45:40,304
..that they can't stay with
one person for a long time.

1523
01:45:41,915 --> 01:45:46,079
l had heard it,
now l have seen it.

1524
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:48,244
Mr. Dev..

1525
01:45:48,321 --> 01:45:53,281
..you may say that American girls
are not faithful to their men..

1526
01:45:53,827 --> 01:45:56,990
.. but l have not known
a man so unfaithful..

1527
01:45:57,064 --> 01:45:59,089
..to the land he belongs to.

1528
01:46:00,934 --> 01:46:05,132
And one more thing, l don't know
about other American girls..

1529
01:46:05,572 --> 01:46:07,005
..but my Mom said..

1530
01:46:07,074 --> 01:46:10,532
..when you love someone,
despite all their faults..

1531
01:46:11,778 --> 01:46:13,769
.. accept them.

1532
01:46:16,149 --> 01:46:20,017
And l came here today,
despite knowing everything,

1533
01:46:20,854 --> 01:46:24,153
l came here to say that l..

1534
01:46:30,163 --> 01:46:32,495
Sometimes you forget that what
is the right thing to do..

1535
01:46:33,567 --> 01:46:35,467
..and that is why even
the light hurts you.

1536
01:46:37,170 --> 01:46:39,536
l hope you understand before
it is too late.

1537
01:46:40,807 --> 01:46:44,402
Remember Dev,
we have only one life to live.

1538
01:47:05,932 --> 01:47:09,799
Are you up Son?
Dev, what is going on?

1539
01:47:10,436 --> 01:47:12,461
You must be wrong somewhere.

1540
01:47:12,838 --> 01:47:14,772
That is why people are
unhappy with you.

1541
01:47:14,974 --> 01:47:16,134
You too mother?

1542
01:47:16,208 --> 01:47:17,505
This is extreme!

1543
01:47:18,344 --> 01:47:20,175
What have l done?

1544
01:47:20,746 --> 01:47:24,978
Have l murdered someone?
What crime have l committed?

1545
01:47:25,251 --> 01:47:27,481
l only wanted to start a business.

1546
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,319
lf my own people can't help me..

1547
01:47:29,388 --> 01:47:31,219
..l am going to seek
help from others.

1548
01:47:31,557 --> 01:47:33,889
But!

1549
01:47:34,226 --> 01:47:38,026
l am telling you that it will
be done, don't worry..

1550
01:47:38,097 --> 01:47:39,121
hmm. Okay.

1551
01:47:39,532 --> 01:47:42,524
Let us go Uncle,
l have been insulted enough.

1552
01:47:43,536 --> 01:47:45,834
Come, let us accomplish the job.

1553
01:47:49,408 --> 01:47:50,898
What are you looking at?

1554
01:47:51,977 --> 01:47:54,912
You are the one who guided me.

1555
01:47:55,381 --> 01:47:58,578
No one understands me here.
Let us go.

1556
01:48:01,554 --> 01:48:05,581
l don't understand, what are you
looking at? Let us go. Okay!

1557
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:08,952
Forget it. l will do it alone.

1558
01:48:09,862 --> 01:48:17,098
God becomes merciful,
one meets with the Guru..

1559
01:48:17,503 --> 01:48:27,105
..who takes him by the arm..

1560
01:48:27,913 --> 01:48:37,923
..and lifts him out, says Nanak.

1561
01:48:37,923 --> 01:48:39,823
..and lifts him out, says Nanak.

1562
01:48:53,504 --> 01:48:55,335
Get away, you crazy man!
What do you want?

1563
01:48:55,573 --> 01:49:00,033
lf l remain indifferent and
don't express my concern,

1564
01:49:00,111 --> 01:49:02,477
ln spirit like existence,
they will keep on wandering,

1565
01:49:02,547 --> 01:49:05,414
How will then l recognize
these changed faces?

1566
01:49:05,483 --> 01:49:08,816
The sun itself will gulp away
the bright daylight,

1567
01:49:08,887 --> 01:49:11,822
Nothing will then survive
in these circumstances.

1568
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:15,519
Alas! What is this route taken
up by The Sixth River!

1569
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:19,025
Stop Son! Don't go.

1570
01:49:56,334 --> 01:49:59,394
lt is 4pm.
Any news from Shamsher Singh?

1571
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:01,097
No news from him, Sir.

1572
01:50:01,906 --> 01:50:04,841
lt was after hard work
of 4 months..

1573
01:50:04,909 --> 01:50:07,469
..that we could entrap this boy.

1574
01:50:07,545 --> 01:50:09,479
Now all our efforts are ruined.

1575
01:50:09,914 --> 01:50:11,541
Solved any problem?

1576
01:50:11,783 --> 01:50:15,549
This is what l have achieved after
the hard work of a week.

1577
01:50:17,288 --> 01:50:18,516
Hmm.

1578
01:50:25,596 --> 01:50:28,292
Moreover, to me it seems..

1579
01:50:28,366 --> 01:50:32,132
..that the white girl has been
sent here to expose us.

1580
01:50:33,037 --> 01:50:36,403
And Dev? He does not know
anything about our plans.

1581
01:50:37,174 --> 01:50:39,438
On the contrary, he will help us.

1582
01:50:39,509 --> 01:50:43,969
Oh Sir, Dev knows nothing
about our drug business.

1583
01:50:44,047 --> 01:50:47,346
He thinks that we deal in liquor.

1584
01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:48,179
And Sir..

1585
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:51,584
..if you feel that our secrets
should remain concealed..

1586
01:50:51,989 --> 01:50:57,086
..then we have to adopt
tough means.

1587
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:00,960
Killa, first of all, get that
white girl out of our way.

1588
01:51:01,231 --> 01:51:03,096
This is a business,
not a frivolous joke.

1589
01:51:03,166 --> 01:51:05,464
l can't afford any risk.
Do you understand?

1590
01:51:08,605 --> 01:51:11,039
Killa, catch him!

1591
01:51:19,483 --> 01:51:27,583
Move on fast!

1592
01:51:32,262 --> 01:51:35,254
Fateh, reach fast near
the Civil Hospital.

1593
01:51:35,332 --> 01:51:37,562
Carrie's life is in danger.
Come fast!

1594
01:51:46,443 --> 01:51:48,434
Hit him

1595
01:51:59,322 --> 01:52:01,882
Get up, hey you big bull!

1596
01:52:38,928 --> 01:52:40,259
Hit him on the head!

1597
01:52:42,465 --> 01:52:43,989
Dev, go to Carrie!

1598
01:52:48,104 --> 01:52:49,867
Go Dev, l will manage!

1599
01:53:15,931 --> 01:53:18,456
Sometimes you forget what the
right thing is, Mr. Dev.

1600
01:53:19,335 --> 01:53:21,166
That's why even light hurts you.

1601
01:53:23,105 --> 01:53:27,474
An evil leader takes complete
control over people's thoughts.

1602
01:53:29,812 --> 01:53:32,440
l pleaded, but time never stopped.

1603
01:53:32,515 --> 01:53:36,383
l tried to hold it back,
but it slipped away.

1604
01:53:38,354 --> 01:53:39,514
Dev!

1605
01:53:41,257 --> 01:53:43,191
Who are these people you
are working with?

1606
01:53:44,827 --> 01:53:49,958
You have to guide people
so that they can use..

1607
01:53:50,032 --> 01:53:52,227
..their own intelligence
and understanding.

1608
01:53:52,868 --> 01:53:55,029
Be cautious and watchful
of the passing time..

1609
01:53:55,104 --> 01:53:57,572
..it does not know how
to stand still.

1610
01:53:57,806 --> 01:54:01,264
Once it is gone,
it does not come back.

1611
01:54:03,111 --> 01:54:06,376
What were you lacking so that you
indulged in such activities?

1612
01:54:08,082 --> 01:54:10,812
Punjab, the land of five rivers..

1613
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:13,451
..and The Sixth River
is of the Punjabis .

1614
01:54:14,989 --> 01:54:19,187
Remember Dev,
we have only one life to live.

1615
01:54:32,106 --> 01:54:33,334
Thank God!

1616
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:43,244
What is it Dev?

1617
01:54:50,959 --> 01:54:53,154
l thank You hundred
thousand times.

1618
01:54:53,928 --> 01:54:57,329
l am glad you are here.
My Sixth River is almost finished.

1619
01:54:57,565 --> 01:54:59,863
Only the last chapter
is incomplete.

1620
01:55:25,793 --> 01:55:27,090
Carrie!

1621
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:48,377
Carrie, where are you? We are
waiting for you in the studio.

1622
01:55:50,183 --> 01:55:51,309
Hello!

1623
01:55:52,352 --> 01:55:57,449
lf you leave him,
he will cry a lot.

1624
01:55:58,525 --> 01:56:00,925
You will look funny crying!

1625
01:56:00,994 --> 01:56:03,929
Dev, where is Carrie?

1626
01:56:06,833 --> 01:56:09,324
Roll camera! Action!

1627
01:56:09,603 --> 01:56:12,436
My name is Hardev Malhotra.

1628
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:17,800
l am that Sixth River born out
of the five rivers of Punjab..

1629
01:56:18,245 --> 01:56:20,236
..which had gone astray.

1630
01:56:20,781 --> 01:56:23,807
The girl who showed me the
right path disappeared..

1631
01:56:24,217 --> 01:56:30,417
..from my life right
in front of my eyes.

1632
01:56:35,295 --> 01:56:36,319
ln her words..

1633
01:56:36,396 --> 01:56:39,923
..l make an appeal, to every
Punjabi, living in Punjab..

1634
01:56:40,267 --> 01:56:42,861
..or outside Punjab.

1635
01:56:43,403 --> 01:56:45,337
lf you come to have
the conviction..

1636
01:56:45,405 --> 01:56:47,236
..that you are the Sixth River..

1637
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:50,032
..then you will also come
to have the sense..

1638
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:52,237
..of responsibility of being
the inheritors of this land.

1639
01:56:52,579 --> 01:56:55,309
lt is too late for me
as l have already..

1640
01:56:55,382 --> 01:56:57,441
..lost my most dear possession.

1641
01:56:57,517 --> 01:57:00,008
But you still have time.

1642
01:57:06,126 --> 01:57:07,787
Looking around it
seemed that the..

1643
01:57:07,861 --> 01:57:08,987
..ever-enthusiastic
spirit of the..

1644
01:57:09,062 --> 01:57:10,529
..Punjabis would soon
have an upper hand..

1645
01:57:10,764 --> 01:57:13,358
..over the (so called)
Sixth River of drugs.

1646
01:57:16,269 --> 01:57:18,328
lt was not enough for
Fateh and myself.

1647
01:57:19,206 --> 01:57:22,073
lt seemed as if the wrong things
were getting eliminated.

1648
01:57:22,242 --> 01:57:24,733
But eliminating wrong
does not mean..

1649
01:57:25,078 --> 01:57:27,046
..that good will automatically
happen.

1650
01:57:28,548 --> 01:57:31,345
Fateh was perturbed about the
empty frame in the University.

1651
01:57:31,417 --> 01:57:33,214
l was concerned about
the last unfinished..

1652
01:57:33,285 --> 01:57:34,752
..chapter of Carrie's book.

1653
01:57:39,058 --> 01:57:42,221
Fateh opened many leadership
schools in Punjab.

1654
01:57:44,563 --> 01:57:47,123
Ranjit formed The Nishkaam
(Selfless) Party.

1655
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:53,468
And then Fateh went back to
Philadelphia after having promised

1656
01:57:54,306 --> 01:57:56,831
Reet to come back next year.

1657
01:57:57,576 --> 01:58:00,875
Fateh had rightly told his Father
-he had sown the seeds.

1658
01:58:01,046 --> 01:58:03,537
And now every six months
some Fateh comes..

1659
01:58:03,983 --> 01:58:07,180
.. from abroad and waters
the plants of Punjab..

1660
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:11,254
..and again goes back
to the foreign land.

1661
01:58:11,791 --> 01:58:15,420
l too,
at times water these plants.

1662
01:58:17,129 --> 01:58:19,222
Preet was blessed with
a daughter next year.

1663
01:58:19,298 --> 01:58:21,163
Deedar Singh again fried jalebies.

1664
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:24,833
Shamsher Singh distributed
jalebies among all his neighbors.
