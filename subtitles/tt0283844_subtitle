Sir! Some girls have
come to meet you.

00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:40,896
Girls? What do l have
to do with girls?

3
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:44,056
You might not. But we want
to meet you. Greetings.

4
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:48,416
Greetings. Who are you? - We are
the students of A.V. College.

5
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:54,656
What do you want? - We don't have
a girl's hostel in our college.

6
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:58,656
We have come to ask donation for
that. - How much donation?

7
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:03,896
We are sure you'll give us
at least 5,000. - 5,000?

8
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:06,176
You can give more if you wish.

9
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:09,016
You are a very rich person and
a barrister of our city.

10
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:12,176
And you always give donation
for good work before anyone.

11
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:16,056
First show me your list. Let me
see who has given how much.

12
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,816
You are asking 5,000 from me.

13
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,976
And you've collected 500
- 1000 from others.

14
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:23,896
Who has given this 2,500?
- My father.

15
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,496
Shivcharan Sharma?
- He is my father.

16

That of Indore? - Yes.

17
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:29,496
That engineer? - Yes.

18
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,376
Are you his daughter?
- Do you know him?

19
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,456
l know him before you were born.

20
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:35,416
When did you all come from Indore?
- It has been 2 years.

21
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:38,816
You've been here for 2 years,
and he didn't even inform me?

22
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:41,616
He didn't tell me for 2
years that he is here.

23
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,896
You're his daughter? - Yes.

24
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:47,336
What's your name? - Mira Sharma.

25
00:03:47,657 --> 00:03:48,976
Mira!

26
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:56,336
l will collect the donation
from your father now. - Yes?

27
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,896
Here. l am coming to
your house with you.

28
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,096
Don't go from here. l'll go change.

29
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,736
According to the opinion
of the doctors..

30
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:08,056
..l had to bring her here urgently.

31
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:09,936
You've done the right
thing, Shivcharan.

32
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,936
She'll get good treatment here.
But l ask you..

33
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:16,136
..why didn't you inform me when
you knew that l live here?

34
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:17,735
You should have at least told me..

35
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,576
..that Bhabhi is not well
since last 3 years.

36
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:22,135
She has an iniury in the backbone.
She can't walk..

37
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:26,616
Bro, it's my mistake. But believe
me, l was too tensed.

38
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:29,136
So much that you couldn't
even call up once?

39
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:30,336
Bhabhi, now you decide.

40
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,176
Either our friendship
will end today..

41
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:33,816
..or we'll have a lifelong relation.

42
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:37,056
lt is a matter between you
2 friends. What do l say?

43
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:41,136
Just tell me, have you promised
Mira's hand to any one?

44
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:45,976
No. Why? - Then from today
Mira is my daughter in law.

45
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,416
l hope you don't mind, Shivcharan.

46
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,896
Why do you need to ask when
you've already decided?

47
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:56,696
That's it.
- But the boy should like the girl.

48
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:00,016
Bro, l haven't let my
boy be influenced..

49
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:02,736
..by the modern lifestyle
as much as l could.

50
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:05,296
Yet l'll send him over. So that
both can meet each other.

51
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:12,096
Shyam, you're going to England.

52
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:14,296
Let's have a party on
this happy occasion.

53
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:17,536
Sure. Who's giving the party?
- You. Who else?

54
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,736
My dear, you always rob me.

55
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,496
You're always looking for
an excuse to have a party.

56
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:24,936
This is a good excuse. Bro, going
to England is a big deal for us.

57
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:27,936
All right, l'll give a party. But
after coming back from England.

58
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:29,216
Now talk about something else.

59
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:34,816
Talk something else? Talk about
girls! Talk about love!

60
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:37,336
Shut up, fatty! What do you have
to do with girls or love?

61
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:41,016
Has any girl talked to you till
now? - That's the bad luck.

62
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:43,456
Whenever l look lovingly at a girl..

63
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:47,576
..either she turns away,
or starts laughing at me.

64
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:51,816
Hey, leave it.

65
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:58,696
Hey, get up from here. And
go to some other table.

66
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:05,656
Why? - Because this is our table.
We sit here every day.

67
00:06:05,737 --> 00:06:09,816
But we are sitting here today.
So you go to the other table.

68
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,496
And please, don't bore us.
- What did you say?

69
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:14,576
Are you deaf?

70
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:19,656
You, wicked.. - Hey, mister!
Aren't you ashamed to hit a girl?

71
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,856
Oh! You're a girl?

72
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:26,296
Forgive me, but looking at you
getup l thought you were a boy.

73
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:30,016
Baby, you shouldn't mess with
such manner less guys.

74
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:33,536
Don't mess, but at least
you can hug us.

75
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:37,096
Guru, she seems to be a foreigner.
- No.

76
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:40,496
Then she must be one of
the Beatles. - No.

77
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:42,896
Then some hippy.
- Wrong.

78
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:47,096
Some Shippy.
- Wrong again.

79
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:49,976
Then you tell us, guru.
- Shall l tell you?

80
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:57,311
Crazy of fashion. These
are Japanese dolls.

81
00:06:57,392 --> 00:07:01,736
Crazy of fashion. These
are Japanese dolls.

82
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:05,696
Who will call her an Indian girl?

83
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:10,749
Speak. Speak. Speak.

84
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,782
Crazy of fashion. These
are Japanese dolls.

85
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:18,944
Who will call her an Indian girl?

86
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:41,536
Cutting the hair short,
powdering the cheeks..

87
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:45,856
..she has made a mess
of a good face.

88
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:50,058
Cutting the hair short,
powdering the cheeks..

89
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,415
..she has made a mess
of a good face.

90
00:07:56,337 --> 00:08:00,616
Bare hands, bare forehead,
kohl in the eyes.

91
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:04,642
Crazy of fashion. These
are Japanese dolls.

92
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:08,934
Who will call her an Indian girl?

93
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:13,810
Speak. Speak. Speak.

94
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:17,681
Crazy of fashion. These

95
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:21,800
Who will call her an Indian girl?

96
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:52,896
O Lord, this beauty. It is all fake.

97
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:57,065
Whoever marries her,
will be unlucky.

98
00:08:57,146 --> 00:09:01,303
O Lord, this beauty. It is all fake.

99
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:06,460
Whoever marries her,
will be unlucky.

100
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:11,822
lf you want to save yourself,
wave them goodbye from far.

101
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:15,768
Crazy of fashion. These
are Japanese dolls.

102
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:19,886
Who will call her an Indian girl?

103
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:24,892
Speak. Speak. Speak.

104
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:28,708
Crazy of fashion. These
are Japanese dolls.

105
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:33,217
Crazy of fashion. These
are Japanese dolls.

106
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:59,616
Woman was considered a goddess
in this country some day.

107
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:04,016
Now a 20 year old girl
is called a baby!

108
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:08,039
Woman was considered a goddess
in this country some day.

109
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,525
Now a 20 year old girl
is called a baby!

110
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:18,568
What sort of queen is this,
who imitates the foreigners?

111
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,687
Crazy of fashion. These
are Japanese dolls.

112
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:26,698

Who will call her an Indian girl?

116
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,256
Forgive me. You might be thinking..

117
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:48,736
..that why did l interfere
in your matter.

118
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:52,016
No, l was thinking how to thank you.

119
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:54,296
There's nothing to thank for.
- There is.

120
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:58,016
lf you hadn't held her hand,
she would have slapped Radha.

121
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,176
What did you say her name is?
- Radha.

122
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:02,456
It's a surprise! - What?

123
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,696
My name is Shyam.
- Shyam?

124
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:08,416
Yes, what a nice coincidence!

125
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,736
Radha, come on.
- Yes.

126
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,296
Greetings. - Greetings.

127
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:34,096
Guru, are you on the right track?
- Shut up, fatty!

128
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:38,416
Guru, my track is too big.

129
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,976
Congratulations, Radha.
- What for?

130
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:43,056
Radha has found her Shyam.

131
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:45,256
l didn't find the guy so bad.

132
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,736
Wow! Good that l found you here,
Radha. - Come on, Shanti.

133
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:51,816
Will you go walking when l am here?
l've just bought a car today.

134
00:11:51,897 --> 00:11:54,136
Come, l'll drop you home.
- There's no need.

135
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:55,416
Who is he?

136
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,816
He lives in my locality. Always
keeps following me.

137
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,296
Shyam! - Yes, father.

138
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,096
Shivcharan is a very old friend
of mine.

139
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:13,776
Go to his home tomorrow.
This is his address.

140
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:19,376
Anything special, father?
- You'll know when you go there.

141
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:32,296
Bro, did you meet father?
- Yes.

142
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,496
Did father tell you where
you have to go tomorrow?

143
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:37,496
At Mr. Sharma's place. - That's it?
Didn't he tell you anything else?

144
00:12:37,617 --> 00:12:39,816
No, why? What's the
matter after all?

145
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:44,896
The same matter from which no girl
or boy has been able to run away.

146
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:48,736
What? - Mr. Sharma has a daughter.
Father saw her.

147
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:51,696
And he chose her for you.
Do you get it now?

148
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:54,216
Why did father think of that? l
have got to go to England yet.

149
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:58,536
Yes, father has decided to set the
matter before you go to England.

150
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:00,416
And then the wedding.

151
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:04,816
All right, l'll see the girl. And
then tell him that l didn't like her.

152
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:07,816
Don't fool me, bro.
You're also exited.

153
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:12,056
Rekha, don't bore me,
and go from here.

154
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:13,736
Telling me?
- Yes.

155
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:33,722
You?
- You? - But how did you come here?

156
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:36,402
Will you believe it? It's
written in my Janamkundali.

157
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:40,580
Written what? - That l will see you
as a stranger in the 1st meeting.

158
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:45,330
And that as a life partner
in the 2nd meeting. - What?

159
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:48,981
Why are you scared? Am l so ugly?

160
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:54,941
What are you saying? Without
know who or what l am, you..

161
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:58,421
Radha, l only know that you
are going to be my wife.

162
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:01,821
And l like you very much.

163
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,501
But l want to know that,
how did you make..

164
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,941
..a lifelong decision by
a meeting of few moments?

165
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:09,381
This is not my decision.
It is that of destiny.

166
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:13,101
And this is called luck.
- You'll make me go mad.

167
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:16,461
And l've already become one! Only
between yesterday and today.

168
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,101
l feel like doing something crazy.

169
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,221
Radha, madam is calling you.

170
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:38,021
Yes, mother. - Radha, doctor had
forgotten a book yesterday.

171
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:40,781
lt's in Mira's room. Go and get it.
- Yes.

172
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:46,821
She looks after me so well that
even a trained nurse cannot.

173
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:51,541
You've done a good thing
by appointing Radha here.

174
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:53,781
She is an educated girl
from a humble family.

175
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,461
She can live here respectably.

176
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,661
And at least she'll be saved..

177
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:59,381
..from the tyranny of
her stepmother all day.

178
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:04,181
She should marry a good
boy and settle down.

179
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:07,341
Madam, l've advised her
many a times on that.

180
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:11,381
l'm even ready to find her a boy.
But she is crazy. - Why?

181
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:12,981
She says she wouldn't let..

182
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:15,061
..the shadow of her bad luck
fall on someone else.

183
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:20,461
Radha, a girl's fate is someone
else's as soon as she is born.

184
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:25,501
Getting a husband is also
written in her fate.

185
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:28,341
And that is called luck.

186
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:46,661
This restlessness is not without
any reason! - What?

187
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:49,341
lt is a Sher by Ghalib.
And it suits you well.

188
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:55,101
Bro, you didn't report me how
my would be sister in law is.

189
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:58,661
But l have understood
seeing your plight.

190
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:01,541
You have understood nothing
seeing my plight.

191
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:05,701
The one who marries that girl will
either be a fool or unlucky.

192
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:09,021
You mean?
- l mean she has a face like Papaya.

193
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:13,981
Eyes like radish. Nose like
a potato. Cheeks like desert.

194
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:15,701
And don't ask about the complexion.

195
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:19,381
lt is like blackberry. Complete
black. - And her voice?

196
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:24,061
Like the one you hear when one
breaks a chestnut with teeth!

197
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:29,181
l got it, bro. The one
who is described with

198
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:33,501
..so many fruits after 1st meeting
must be full of juice.

199
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:35,461
Must be very sweet, right?
- What?

200
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,861
Here's her telephone number.
- So? What do l do?

201
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:42,381
At least say thank you.
- Thank you? - Yes.

202
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,981
Looks like it's Radha's voice.
- Who are you? - Shyam.

203
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:55,701
Ok, listen.

204
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,781
Cancel whatever program you have
tomorrow after 8 o'clock.

205
00:16:58,862 --> 00:17:02,301
What? - Yes, cancel because
we're going on a picnic.

206
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:08,581
Forgive me, but l can't come.
- You will surely go. - But..

207
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:11,701
l'll look after mother.
Tomorrow is Sunday.

208
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:21,141
Where's the picnic? Ok,
l'll be there.

209
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,701
Ok, one more thing.
- What?

210
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:35,261
Tea, father. - Keep it there,
daughter. Where is Shyam?

211
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:38,701
Bro left early in the morning.
- He is a strange boy.

212
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:41,541
Didn't meet me last night. Goes
off early this morning.

213
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:43,901
He should inform me whether he
went to Shivcharan's house.

214
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:47,341
Whether he liked the girl..
- l had asked as soon as he came.

215
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:50,901
What did he say?
- He was praising her so much..

216
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:55,261
Greetings, mister.
- Come, hunter, Banne Khan Bhopali!

217
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:59,421
Where had you been?
- Had gone to Bhopal. To hunt.

218
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:01,861
Sit. What did you hunt?
Did you hunt many deer?

219
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:04,061
l don't lift my rifle
on small animals.

220
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:06,701
l've hunted down such a
big cheetah this time..

221
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:08,861
..that you'll iump of
joy when you see it.

222
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:10,501
How are you Rekha?
- l'm fine.

223
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:13,141
Brothers, why have you stopped
outside? Come in.

224
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:19,501
Come in. Here. Put it here.

225
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:23,501
Wow, uncle Banne!

226
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:26,181
Wow Banne! It actually
is a big cheetah.

227
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:27,901
But why did you bring it here?

228
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:32,341
Bro, if l had left it in the
jungle, the vultures would eat it.

229
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:35,061
Wow! You've done a good hunt.

230
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:37,701
l haven't seen such a mischievous
cheetah in life.

231
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,221
You mean? - Played hide and
seek for 3 days with me.

232
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:42,661
The wretched didn't give
me time to even eat lime.

233
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,901
But l wasn't going to let it go.

234
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:47,341
l saw it the 13th time. And
l fired the 13th bullet.

235
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:49,901
And you know the aim of
Banne Khan Bhopali.

236
00:18:49,982 --> 00:18:53,021
The bullet hit it in the chest.
Forgot to play hide and seek.

237
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:56,141
You killed him with one bullet?
- Yes, one.

238
00:18:56,222 --> 00:19:02,501
Banne Khan, say the truth.
- Bro, l shot 5 bullets at it.

239
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,061
But why did you bring
it to my house?

240
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,141
For you.
- For me? - Yes.

241
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:09,581
Banne Khan, you must have
spend much money after it.

242
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:13,181
Don't talk about money, bro.
It is a gift from Banne Khan.

243
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:16,181
lt will stand in a corner and
remind you of our friendship.

244
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:18,381
Banne Khan, come, let's have tea.

245
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:21,181
No, no tea. l've shut down
my shop and come here.

246
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:23,821
People must be waiting for me.
l'll come some other day.

247
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:28,141
Greetings, bro. Come on, guys.

248
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:31,741
Greetings. How are you?

249
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:34,701
Come, Bhabhi. - Greetings, auntie.

250
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,221
God bless you!

251
00:19:36,302 --> 00:19:38,261
lt is dead.
- Oh! It is false?

252
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:41,181
lt's a Jugadari cheetah.
Banne Khan has shot him.

253
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,101
Whoever might have shot him.
It's still a cheetah.

254
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:49,381
How's your health? - l'm alive!
Doctors have refused me to eat.

255
00:19:49,462 --> 00:19:51,781
So l'm surviving on these
gram and Kurmure.

256
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:54,821
Raian was coming this way. l
thought l'll go along and meet you.

257
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,381
Good. Come, Raian.

258
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,581
Sit. Raian, you'll have to handle..

259
00:20:00,662 --> 00:20:03,101
..the office alone after
Shyam goes to England.

260
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:04,381
Will you be able to handle that?

261
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,781
Don't worry, uncle. l'll
manage everything.

262
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,101
lt is a big responsibility..

263
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:09,981
Let him do it, brother in law.

264
00:20:10,062 --> 00:20:13,421
You always consider your sister's
son Shyam capable.

265
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:15,181
Actually the brother's
son has the 1st right.

266
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:17,781
That's right, Bhabhi. l'm talking
about the responsibilities.

267
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:20,061
Not about the distribution of the
property. It's early for that.

268
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:22,221
You've taken the matter
on wrong track.

269
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:24,301
l don't know how to put
forward my thoughts.

270
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:26,541
Then keep quiet, mother.
- All right, Rajan.

271
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:30,221
Rekha, where is Shyam?
l don't see him.

272
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:32,061
l don't know where he has
gone since the morning.

273
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,021
Radha!

274
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,421
Where are we going this way?

275
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:14,061
To a nice place where there
is no crowd. No noise.

276
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:17,301
Only you and me.
- You go if you want.

277
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,501
Shyam!

278
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:50,701
lt's a nice place, isn't it?
There's no crowd, no noise.

279
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:54,181
Only you and me, and this mud.

280
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:03,141
And you look like
a lotus in the mud.

281
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,501
Don't ioke.
- l am telling the truth.

282
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,341
Madam, come out now.

283
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:27,341
You've had shower and your
clothes are washed, too.

284
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:30,181
First you move from there.
- Why?

285
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:33,621
How can l come in front of
you in these wet clothes?

286
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:37,021
Ok, you don't come. l'll come
in front of you. - No!

287
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:41,261
Were you scared? - Look, don't
irritate me. l'm feeling cold.

288
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:44,261
But l have no intention
of moving from here.

289
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:47,381
Please, you are under my oath.

290
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:53,181
Now l will have to move.
l've gone, madam.

291
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:12,381
You are a strange girl! Is anyone
so shy of his own people?

292
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:14,821
Our own ones don't bother
us like this.

293
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:17,341
Promise that you won't come
up with any new pranks.

294
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,141
l won't.

295
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:22,461
First swear on me.
- l swear on myself.

296
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:23,941
Not on you, swear on me.

297
00:23:24,062 --> 00:23:28,141
One does not swear on those who
are lovelier than the moon.

298
00:23:29,902 --> 00:23:33,021
So, you don't believe me?

299
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:39,901
Look, Radha, for the 1st time
in my life l've loved you.

300
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:46,901
And to make you believe that..
come with me.

301
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:48,261
Come.

302
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:03,941
Look, it's a God's temple. l swear
on it and make you mine.

303
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:06,701
Do you believe me now?

304
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:11,621
Go and dry up your clothes
or it'll soon be evening.

305
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:16,621
And listen! l've made you
mine in front of God.

306
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:19,461
But you also accept me now.

307
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:50,581
Whether people believe it or not..

308
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:53,389
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

309
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,897
Whether people believe it or not..

310
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:58,341
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

311
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:03,181
..has become dearer
than my own life now.

312
00:25:03,262 --> 00:25:05,725
Whether people believe it or not..

313
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:08,449
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

314
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,871
Whether people believe it or not..

315
00:25:10,952 --> 00:25:13,325
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

316
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:18,589
..has become dearer
than my own life now.

317
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:49,461
Now we have to fulfill
only one dream.

318
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:58,541
l want to give you the
Iove of many lives.

319
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:03,941
Since the day l met you, l've
started believing in destiny.

320
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:09,101
l wanted to be yours. And
l've become yours now.

321
00:26:09,182 --> 00:26:11,573
Whether people believe it or not..

322
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,038
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

323
00:26:14,223 --> 00:26:18,892
..has become dearer
than my own life now.

324
00:26:30,262 --> 00:26:39,981
Don't look at me like this
with a smile. l feel shy.

325
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:49,341
lf l control my body,
my mind strays off.

326
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:54,661
One receives love for love.
Why are you shy of me?

327
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:59,876
Our eyes have signaled
to each other.

328
00:26:59,957 --> 00:27:02,297
Whether people believe it or not..

329
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:04,924
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

330
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:09,843
..has become dearer
than my own life now.

331
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:25,821
Your eyes are pretty. Your
cheeks are blushing.

332
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:30,621
Your lips are like flowers.

333
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:35,781
l am not content, no matter
how long l look at you.

334
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,981
Good that l met you.

335
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:50,261
This black hair, these fair body.
l've found the support of life.

336
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:52,567
Whether people believe it or not..

337
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:55,086
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

338
00:27:55,167 --> 00:28:00,146
..has become dearer
than my own life now.

339
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:02,664
Whether people believe it or not..

340
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:05,064
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

341
00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:09,648
..has become dearer
than my own life now.

342
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,610
Whether people believe it or not..

343
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,107
..the one who was stranger
till yesterday..

344
00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:19,907
..has become dearer
than my own life now.

345
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:25,160
..has become dearer
than my own life now.

346
00:28:26,382 --> 00:28:28,141
Shanti, l'll take my clothes later.

347
00:28:28,222 --> 00:28:31,821
But, Radha, you didn't tell
me how your clothes got wet.

348
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:36,661
l'll tell you later. l'm getting late
and mother might be upset with me.

349
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:43,821
Here.
- What's the need for this, Shankar?

350
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:48,301
My housework is going fine.
- This sari has become old.

351
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:51,541
Get a new sari. And you also need
uncle's medicines, right?

352
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:54,781
Shankar, all that you've
done for this family..

353
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:57,901
Auntie, l've done it considering
it my own. Am l a stranger?

354
00:28:58,222 --> 00:28:59,461
Ok, l'll leave.

355
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:01,661
Come again. - Yes.

356
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:11,701
Back from the picnic? Wow!
Changed the clothes, too?

357
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:14,701
Who was with you?
- Shankar!

358
00:29:14,782 --> 00:29:17,581
You don't need to interfere
in my matters.

359
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:25,821
Aren't you ashamed? You go to
picnic leaving your ill father..

360
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:30,781
..at home, saying that you're
going for the job?

361
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:35,381
Why are you staring? Every word of
mine pinches you like a scorpion.

362
00:29:35,462 --> 00:29:38,421
Enough, mother. l got
a bit late today.

363
00:29:38,502 --> 00:29:40,581
And it'll be too late tomorrow.

364
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:44,781
lf you make some mistake,
you'll defame us. - Mother!

365
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:50,461
Radha, go in.
- And stay at home from tomorrow.

366
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:52,821
You won't go for the iob now.
- Why?

367
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:55,021
Because Shankar doesn't like it.

368
00:29:55,102 --> 00:29:57,701
And l've promised Radha's
hand to Shankar.

369
00:29:58,022 --> 00:30:04,501
Father, l don't like Shankar. l'll
kill myself before l marry him.

370
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:11,021
Did you hear that? Send her to
college to study. Send her on job.

371
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:13,221
She doesn't respect parents at all.

372
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:15,941
lf she were my daughter,
l'd cut her tongue.

373
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:23,021
There's no need to send Radha.
Perhaps l'll recover.

374
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,701
Perhaps l'll be able to
repay Shankar's debt.

375
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:37,821
Father and l had gone to Mr.
Sharma's place. - Really?

376
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:41,421
But you hadn't met him.
- Why do l need to meet him?

377
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:44,781
Ok, tell me, how did you find
your would be sister in law?

378
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:47,221
Would be sister in law?
- Yes.

379
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:50,901
Shall l tell you how l found her?
- Yes.

380
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:58,421
Very bad! Her face is like Papaya.
Eyes like radish.

381
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:03,981
Nose like a potato. And
cheeks like desert.

382
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:08,261
l tell you bro, refuse her.
Or you'll be trapped.

383
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:12,581
l'm already badly trapped, Rekha.
l cannot refuse now.

384
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:15,341
Father has promised Mr. Sharma.

385
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:17,541
And it is my duty to obey father.

386
00:31:19,582 --> 00:31:20,861
Shyam!

387
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,541
Yes, father. -
Here's your plane ticket.

388
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,221
You have a flight
early next morning.

389
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:29,581
Where were you all day? - l had
gone for a picnic with friends.

390
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:31,621
Shivcharan had invited
you on dinner.

391
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:34,301
There's no time left now. But
call him before you leave.

392
00:31:34,382 --> 00:31:35,941
Go and rest now. You've got
to wake up early tomorrow.

393
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:37,661
Let him rest now.

394
00:31:46,702 --> 00:31:48,701
l'm Shyam.
- Yes?

395
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,021
l've got the ticket.

396
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:51,981
And l'm leaving for the airport.

397
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:56,381
l'll meet you first of all as soon
as l return. Will you wait for me?

398
00:31:57,262 --> 00:32:02,421
And listen. l'm sorry for
yesterday. l hope you'll forgive me.

399
00:32:02,662 --> 00:32:05,501
Doesn't matter. - Shyam, come
fast. We're getting late.

400
00:32:05,582 --> 00:32:06,981
Ok, l'm going.

401
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:11,261
Mira!

402
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:20,181
What is it, mother? - Whose call
was it so early in the morning?

403
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:24,061
Mr. Shukla's son..
- Shyam?

404
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:27,901
He was apologizing for being unable
to come to dinner last night.

405
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:32,781
l want to meet him once.
- You'll have to wait then.

406
00:32:33,222 --> 00:32:35,781
He is going abroad today itself.
- Today?

407
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:37,581
Yes, right now.

408
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:43,901
Look, bro, l've never
been to London.

409
00:32:43,982 --> 00:32:46,621
But l've heard that the English
madams keep following you.

410
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:48,901
You save yourself.
- Don't worry, uncle Banne.

411
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:50,301
You're very smart.

412
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:54,901
But the thing is that it is only
your father whom l call brother.

413
00:32:54,982 --> 00:32:58,261
He might forgive you.
But you know my anger.

414
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:02,941
Bro, what are you teaching Shyam?
Are you teaching him hunting?

415
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,741
No, bro. l was telling him about
the lifestyle of London.

416
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:09,661
Tell him not to bring along
any madam. - l've told him.

417
00:33:09,742 --> 00:33:12,021
You've already told him? - Yes.
- Come to the airport with us.

418
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:14,821
Wait. l've come leisurely
on my cycle.

419
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:17,621
l'll take a shortcut and reach
the airport before you.

420
00:33:17,702 --> 00:33:20,701
Come, let's have a race.
- Yes, you guys sit in.

421
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:34,821
l'm so iealous. And you don't
feel anything? - About what?

422
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:38,021
Brother in law sent Shyam abroad.

423
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:40,741
And didn't send you till
Jumri Talaiya either.

424
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:44,061
Uncle is the master of his own
wish, and also his property.

425
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:46,781
You are the actual heir
to that property.

426
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:48,821
You are the son of his own brother.

427
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,581
And Shyam is his sister's son.

428
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,221
Look, mother, l'm doing
an important job.

429
00:33:52,302 --> 00:33:54,061
l don't have the time
to hear any lecture.

430
00:33:54,142 --> 00:33:57,661
You'll do clerical
work all your life.

431
00:33:57,742 --> 00:34:01,701
And one day brother in law will
give away all his property to Shyam.

432
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:03,021
The same matter again?

433
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:07,461
Mother l am so talented that l can
put lakhs of rupees at your feet.

434
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:09,741
l'm iust waiting for
the right chance.

435
00:34:09,822 --> 00:34:12,861
l've become old listening this.

436
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,261
ls it done?

437
00:35:00,342 --> 00:35:01,621
Here, child.

438
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:06,661
Shall l tell you something?
Taking the advantage..

439
00:35:06,742 --> 00:35:10,781
..of Shyam's absence, butter
your uncle a bit.

440
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:15,301
And talk nicely to Rekha sometimes.
After all she is your sis.

441
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:18,421
And the dear daughter of brother
in law. - She might be.

442
00:35:18,502 --> 00:35:21,141
But l want to keep away
from such a sis.

443
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:23,901
She goes out of the house saying
that she is going for studies.

444
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:25,501
And then flirts around in parks.

445
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:26,941
And that, too, with a 3rd class boy.

446
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:28,261
What are you saying?

447
00:35:31,102 --> 00:35:34,901
Such a cold sigh? Why?
- l've caught God's mistake today.

448
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:38,021
What? - Why didn't he get us
born in a foreign country?

449
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,381
Where two love filled hearts
don't have to get tortured.

450
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:41,701
We'd have seen each other
in the morning..

451
00:35:41,782 --> 00:35:42,981
..engaged in the afternoon,
and wedded at night.

452
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:44,141
And divorced the next day!

453
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:46,381
But we would at least be wedded
before the divorce.

454
00:35:46,582 --> 00:35:49,381
Rekha, think over my plight.

455
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:52,981
And tell me when, where and
how will we get married?

456
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:55,141
My mind has failed thinking
over this matter.

457
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,341
And now one day my heart
will fail, too.

458
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,941
Talk to my father before it fails!
- The same thing again?

459
00:36:01,022 --> 00:36:02,901
Am l going to marry
you or your father?

460
00:36:02,982 --> 00:36:06,701
You are an idiot!
- Every lover is an idiot, Rekha.

461
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:08,821
Hey, Rekha!

462
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:14,421
Rekha, listen to me.
- Don't you dare follow me!

463
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:18,901
Rekha, listen.. - Let madam Rekha
go, dear. You stand here.

464
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:23,221
Am l sitting? Leave
my neck. Who are you?

465
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,661
You talk too much, dear. If l
had married on the right time..

466
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:30,101
..l would be having a worthless
child like you now.

467
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:31,661
What do you want?

468
00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:34,021
First you tell me your name.
- My name is Deepak.

469
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:39,421
lt's a good name. But why are
you roaming around Rekha?

470
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:40,981
We study in the same class.

471
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:43,461
What class do you have
here in the park?

472
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:47,461
Uncle Banne! - You don't need
to say anything, child.

473
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:50,061
l've seen him following you.

474
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:52,181
No, the thing is..
- Is he your uncle?

475
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:57,541
You talk to me, dear. Rekha,
child, you go home. Go.

476
00:36:57,622 --> 00:36:59,541
l'll go, too!
- Where are you going?

477
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:02,501
lf you had a class in the park,
Iearn a lesson from me, too.

478
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:08,461
What? - The lesson is that, if l
ever see you with Rekha again..

479
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,661
What will you do then?
- Don't argue with me.

480
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:16,821
Or your bones will be broken and
l'll be in jail for six months.

481
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:21,341
So run away from here. Run. Run!

482
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:26,861
Radha! - Dinu uncle?

483
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:28,341
There's a Ietter for you.

484
00:37:28,422 --> 00:37:29,941
For me? - Yes.

485
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:33,981
l was going to the market. l thought
l'll give it to you on the way.

486
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:37,581
And why did you stop coming
for the job, child?

487
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:40,061
l won't be able to come
now, uncle Dinu.

488
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:42,901
Mother doesn't like me doing a iob.

489
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:45,701
Ok, l'll leave now. - Have tea.

490
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:47,381
l'm in a hurry right now.

491
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:50,421
l'll come some other day,
child. God bless you.

492
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,621
Queen of my heart! l'm going
abroad for a few months.

493
00:38:06,982 --> 00:38:10,581
Please, don't feel bad about not
meeting you before leaving.

494
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:13,301
l'm forced to go so far after
being so close to you.

495
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:18,741
Yet you'll always be with me.
In my heart, in the hearbeats.

496
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:21,101
Wait for my return.

497
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:24,141
And whenever you remember
me, remember that..

498
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:26,901
..with our bodies, our souls
have also become one.

499
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:29,421
We have become one forever.

500
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:33,101
We'll get married as
soon as l return.

501
00:38:33,382 --> 00:38:36,541
And then l won't say.
Think for yourself.

502
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:42,181
Yours and only yours for
many lives, Shyam.

503
00:38:54,862 --> 00:38:56,181
Mother?

504
00:38:57,062 --> 00:38:59,541
Can you hide your feelings by
hiding the photo from your mom?

505
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:03,101
How long will you worship
her secretly?

506
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,221
Take me to Mira's mother.
l'll talk to her.

507
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:10,381
What will you say, mother? There's
nothing to talk about.

508
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:13,861
Then why do you keep seeing
Mira's photo day and night?

509
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:17,621
Just like that. l like her.

510
00:39:18,182 --> 00:39:22,141
She is good, worth having
as a daughter in law.

511
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:27,141
Mother, all beautiful dreams
don't change to reality.

512
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:31,541
Fearing that l haven't let
Mira know till now..

513
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,821
..that she holds a very special
place in my heart.

514
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:36,981
lt's possible that
she likes you, too.

515
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:39,461
Have you ever tried
to find that out?

516
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:44,381
This is that beautiful dream,
mother, with which l amuse myself.

517
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:49,501
Hoping that it will
turn true some day.

518
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:51,101
You are crazy.

519
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:53,861
You are supposed to visit Mr.
Sharma's place today, right?

520
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:56,541
Yes. - Then talk to Mira's mother
today itself.

521
00:39:56,622 --> 00:40:00,061
Mother?
- Yes, you have my blessings.

522
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:03,141
Come, doctor.

523
00:40:04,142 --> 00:40:07,141
Greetings, madam.
- Greetings. Have a seat.

524
00:40:08,422 --> 00:40:12,901
You look quite well today. - l've
improved a lot with your treatment.

525
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:16,621
Madam, l want to say something.

526
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:21,461
l'll surely listen. But
have these sweets first.

527
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:26,541
Sweets? What's the occasion?
- Mira's marriage is fixed.

528
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:30,101
We've found a decent family.
The boy has gone abroad.

529
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:32,381
The marriage will take place
as soon as he returns.

530
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,861
Congratulations, Mira.

531
00:40:35,942 --> 00:40:39,141
Sweeten your mouth.
- Yes.

532
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,141
Oh yes, you were going to
say something, weren't you?

533
00:40:43,222 --> 00:40:48,821
Yes. You'll recover fast if
you get the operation done.

534
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:52,461
l'll get it done as soon as
Mira's wedding is completed.

535
00:40:56,462 --> 00:40:58,701
Mr. Mehta, l won't be coming
to the office from tomorrow.

536
00:40:58,782 --> 00:41:02,461
Why, uncle? - The doctor has told
me that l should rest now.

537
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:04,861
And l get tired very
soon these days.

538
00:41:04,942 --> 00:41:09,741
Send the important office work
to me with Rajan. l'll see it.

539
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:10,981
As you say, sir.

540
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:14,861
You shouldn't worry about the
office work, uncle. l will take care.

541
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:17,221
You should rest now.

542
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:20,501
l also wish that. Let Shyam
come from England.

543
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:23,141
Then you brothers handle
the work together.

544
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:27,461
Take this.
- Here.

545
00:41:32,902 --> 00:41:36,501
How come you're here? - You like
Hotel Evening Star, don't you?

546
00:41:36,582 --> 00:41:40,061
You mean? - It is mortgaged
with me for 1 lakh rupees.

547
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:43,741
Here's that agreement. It owner
died the day before yesterday.

548
00:41:43,822 --> 00:41:46,861
l changed the document.
- What benefit do l get in it?

549
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:51,621
A 60 - 40 partnership.
60 mine and 40 yours.

550
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:57,621
But, pal, take care of one thing.
- Which one?

551
00:41:57,702 --> 00:42:01,061
You've come to this office today.
But never come again.

552
00:42:02,142 --> 00:42:04,061
Uncle is a very strict person.

553
00:42:04,142 --> 00:42:08,381
lf he sees you in the office, l'll
be in the same plight as you are.

554
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:12,341
l'll be bald! Show me what it is.

555
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:39,661
Looks like you didn't find
any work today also.

556
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:45,981
Did you go at Dr. Kailash's place?
- How could l go there, mom?

557
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,981
l had to leave the iob he
gave me because of you.

558
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:56,461
But l had also told
you to marry Shankar.

559
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:57,741
l've already given
the answer to that.

560
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:00,341
That's why Shankar has
stopped giving money.

561
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,581
We haven't bought your father's
medicines for 2 days.

562
00:43:02,662 --> 00:43:04,221
And we also have to pay the
rent the day after tomorrow.

563
00:43:04,302 --> 00:43:07,901
But what do l do, mother?
- Accept the proposal, Radha.

564
00:43:07,982 --> 00:43:12,501
l'll convince Shankar.
- No, mother. It is impossible.

565
00:43:33,382 --> 00:43:38,581
Rascal! Shameless, scoundrel!
Whose sin are you carrying?

566
00:43:38,662 --> 00:43:43,541
Speak up! Answer! With whom
did you sleep? Speak up.

567
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:46,541
Mother!
- Don't you dare call me mother!

568
00:43:47,662 --> 00:43:51,061
Are you listening? There's
good news for you.

569
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:53,781
You're going to be a grandpa!

570
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:56,621
What? - Ask your dear.

571
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:59,421
Now l understand why she
is refusing to marry.

572
00:43:59,502 --> 00:44:02,221
lt's fine. Why bother
about marriage..

573
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:05,741
..when you can have everything
without it?

574
00:44:05,822 --> 00:44:07,301
Radha?

575
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:11,901
Forgive me, father.
- Go away from here.

576
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:15,101
Destiny had destroyed
everything of mine.

577
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:20,901
l only had prestige left.
You've ruined it, too.

578
00:44:23,902 --> 00:44:26,901
Get up. You are dead for us now.

579
00:44:26,982 --> 00:44:29,101
We have no relation
with you from today.

580
00:44:29,262 --> 00:44:32,821
Get out from here. l say get out!

581
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:44,461
Get out of here.
- No, mother. Where will l go?

582
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:54,261
Are you sure he won't cheat you?

583
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:57,981
Yes, Shanti. He has promised me.

584
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:02,381
Men always promise, but are
unable to fulfill that.

585
00:45:02,702 --> 00:45:05,061
Specially that promise
which is called..

586
00:45:05,142 --> 00:45:09,901
..a man's mistake and a woman's
sin in our society.

587
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:12,981
l've fallen from the eyes
of my parents today.

588
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:15,861
And tomorrow you'll from
the eyes of the world.

589
00:45:15,942 --> 00:45:19,661
Shanti, l've come as
a helpless to you.

590
00:45:20,102 --> 00:45:23,101
Tell me what do l do now.
Where do l go?

591
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:26,781
Will you listen to my advice?
Go to Dr. Kailash immediately.

592
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:29,141
Only he can free you from this sin.

593
00:45:29,222 --> 00:45:33,861
This would be better for you.

594
00:45:38,262 --> 00:45:44,341
Doctor! - Radha? At this hour?
What's the matter?

595
00:45:45,822 --> 00:45:51,181
You give life to everyone, don't
you? Give me death! - What?

596
00:45:51,422 --> 00:45:56,101
Give me some medicine that
might sleep me forever.

597
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,261
Here, drink it.

598
00:46:20,502 --> 00:46:23,021
You'll feel pain,
only for 5 minutes.

599
00:46:30,942 --> 00:46:33,821
Why don't you drink? You
want death, don't you?

600
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:43,101
lt is easy to say, Radha.
But it's not easy to die.

601
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:46,861
l can't tell you about my
helplessness, doctor.

602
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:50,301
You don't need to say either,
Radha. l am a doctor.

603
00:46:50,782 --> 00:46:54,781
lt is no surprise for me that an
unmarried girl is going to be a mother.

604
00:46:55,302 --> 00:46:56,901
You've already made a mistake.

605
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,381
And now you want to commit
this crime? - What?

606
00:46:59,462 --> 00:47:03,101
lsn't it a sin to play with
your and that child's life?

607
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:06,261
But, doctor, it is also
a sin to give birth..

608
00:47:06,342 --> 00:47:10,301
..to the child who is a sign
of its mother's mistake.

609
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:15,741
Radha, only God is the master
of life and death.

610
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,421
Come. Come with me.

611
00:47:27,102 --> 00:47:33,301
She is my mother. Not only mine,
but also of all these kids.

612
00:47:34,382 --> 00:47:38,141
Radha, try and be a mother
of one such child.

613
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:41,861
And then decide whether they
have a right to live or not.

614
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:46,181
Enough, doctor! Forgive me.

615
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:51,621
On one condition. Till you are
helpless, you won't go from here.

616
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:54,141
You'll live with mother.

617
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:58,621
Radha, how old are you?

618
00:48:00,102 --> 00:48:01,341
22 years.

619
00:48:01,622 --> 00:48:05,541
A life which took 22 years to
be build, is very precious.

620
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:10,381
lt is a big crime to try
and crush it in a moment.

621
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,621
Remember this.

622
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:32,301
Rekha!
- Do you have a sore throat?

623
00:48:32,502 --> 00:48:35,501
l had. But it's ok now
that l've met you.

624
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:39,021
lt's ok. You are calling
my name so loudly!

625
00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:40,421
What will others think
if they hear that?

626
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:42,861
lf he's a smart person..

627
00:48:42,942 --> 00:48:44,781
..he'll understand that l
am following uncle Majnu.

628
00:48:44,862 --> 00:48:47,901
He used to call Laila.
And l am calling Rekha!

629
00:48:48,022 --> 00:48:50,821
Don't blabber! l'm tired of you.

630
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:59,381
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

631
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:03,261
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

632
00:49:03,342 --> 00:49:07,061
..l've forgotten to eat,
drink or sleep.

633
00:49:07,142 --> 00:49:10,901
l was a useful man.
Now l'm worthless.

634
00:49:11,877 --> 00:49:15,811
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

635
00:49:15,892 --> 00:49:19,703
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

636
00:49:19,784 --> 00:49:23,487
..l've forgotten to eat,
drink or sleep.

637
00:49:23,568 --> 00:49:27,260
l was a useful man.
Now l'm worthless.

638
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:52,461
Since the day l gave you my heart,
l've made you my killer.

639
00:49:52,542 --> 00:50:00,407
Since the day l gave you my heart,
l've made you my killer.

640
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:08,559
You make me restless day and night.
You make me go crazy.

641
00:50:08,782 --> 00:50:13,221
l'll also have a chance
to take revenge one day.

642
00:50:13,522 --> 00:50:17,499
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

643
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,315
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

644
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:25,088
..l've forgotten to eat,
drink or sleep.

645
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:29,531
l was a useful man.
Now l'm worthless.

646
00:50:46,022 --> 00:50:53,910
This love is quite expensive.
l'm waiting for marriage.

647
00:50:53,991 --> 00:51:01,821
This love is quite expensive.
l'm waiting for marriage.

648
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:10,014
l have faith in God.
l've though over.

649
00:51:10,095 --> 00:51:14,661
l'll get the fruits of my hard work.

650
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:18,743
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

651
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:22,527
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

652
00:51:22,608 --> 00:51:26,257
..l've forgotten to eat,
drink or sleep.

653
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:29,890
l was a useful man.
Now l'm worthless.

654
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:34,905
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

655
00:51:34,986 --> 00:51:38,743
Rekha, O Rekha! Since
the day l've seen you..

656
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:42,376
..l've forgotten to eat,
drink or sleep.

657
00:51:42,604 --> 00:51:46,635
l was a useful man.
Now l'm worthless.

658
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,141
Master, does a lion
die with one bullet?

659
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:07,381
Forget the lion. And
fix this puncture.

660
00:52:07,462 --> 00:52:10,901
Shut up! l'm not a coward like you.

661
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:16,621
Master, will you take me with
you this time to hunt a lion?

662
00:52:16,902 --> 00:52:21,821
Dear bro, the thing is that
when a lion roars..

663
00:52:21,902 --> 00:52:27,741
..in the iungle, even the bravest
of all is scared stiff.

664
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:30,541
See? You're scared at hearing the
name. Come on. Blow the air.

665
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:35,701
Uncle Banne! - Rekha! How come
you're here at the shop?

666
00:52:35,782 --> 00:52:37,781
There's a telegram from bro. He's
coming back from England.

667
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:39,941
l thought l would inform you.
- Good.

668
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:42,221
How's your father? - He's fine.

669
00:52:42,982 --> 00:52:46,781
So, dear, do you also whistle like
this looking at your sister?

670
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:49,381
ln which school is it taught to
whistle when you see a girl?

671
00:52:49,462 --> 00:52:51,621
Forgive me. l won't do
this mistake again.

672
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:56,341
Look, you seem to be from a good
family. Learn good things.

673
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:01,861
Rekha, go home. Give my
regards to your father.

674
00:53:01,942 --> 00:53:04,701
And tell him that l'll reach
at the airport. Go now.

675
00:53:31,422 --> 00:53:32,901
Brother!

676
00:53:36,942 --> 00:53:38,421
Mister Shyam!

677
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,781
Thank you very much, bro..

678
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:49,741
..that you didn't forget your
sis after going abroad.

679
00:53:51,742 --> 00:53:54,661
But, bro, 2 dresses
of the same color?

680
00:53:54,742 --> 00:53:56,381
One is for you.

681
00:53:56,702 --> 00:53:58,981
And the 2nd? - For someone else.

682
00:53:59,582 --> 00:54:03,821
l know. That means for the
one who is going to be..

683
00:54:05,462 --> 00:54:07,661
Come, have food.
- l'll have it later.

684
00:54:07,742 --> 00:54:10,061
l wasn't able to meet Mr.
Sharma before going abroad.

685
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:11,581
And father was very upset with that.

686
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:14,061
l think l should go and meet him.
- Only Mr. Sharma?

687
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:17,661
You mean? - You've iust returned
from the airport.

688
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:19,501
And you want to go to your
matrimonial house so soon?

689
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:22,501
The meaning is clear.
- Silly, these are just formalities.

690
00:54:22,582 --> 00:54:27,741
l'll be right back. - The truth is
that, you came and you're going.

691
00:54:28,502 --> 00:54:31,101
Bro, you forgot this gift.

692
00:54:34,542 --> 00:54:35,861
lt is nice.

693
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:41,941
Master, Mr. Shyam has come.

694
00:54:42,022 --> 00:54:43,221
Shyam!

695
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,941
Greetings. - God bless you.

696
00:54:46,222 --> 00:54:49,101
l apologize, son. l couldn't
come to receive you..

697
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:52,061
..at the airport as Mira's mother
was not feeling well.

698
00:54:52,142 --> 00:54:54,381
Mira! Mira, child.

699
00:54:58,022 --> 00:54:59,501
Shyam has come.

700
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,581
Why are you so shy? He is Shyam.

701
00:55:29,902 --> 00:55:33,421
Shyam, the doctor has come.
l'll go and meet him.

702
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:35,301
You both sit and talk to each other.

703
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:38,621
ls your name Mira?

704
00:55:42,182 --> 00:55:43,341
Yes.

705
00:55:43,422 --> 00:55:45,781
Do you have a sis?

706
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:52,221
No. Why?
- No, l was asking just..

707
00:55:52,302 --> 00:55:53,661
Shyam!

708
00:55:56,182 --> 00:55:58,421
Mira's mother
is eager to meet you.

709
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:01,221
Mira, didn't you offer
any tea to Shyam?

710
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:03,901
Go and make a 1st class hot
tea for Shyam.

711
00:56:03,982 --> 00:56:05,261
Come, child.

712
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:12,901
Mira's mother, Shyam has come.
- Greetings.

713
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:17,581
God bless you, child.
Doctor, he is Shyam.

714
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,181
Glad to meet you.

715
00:56:21,662 --> 00:56:23,421
Ok, madam, l'll Ieave now.

716
00:56:23,502 --> 00:56:24,941
Greetings, Mr. Sharma.

717
00:56:26,942 --> 00:56:28,941
Sit, child. - No, mother.

718
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:31,021
l'll take your leave. - Why?

719
00:56:31,542 --> 00:56:33,621
l've come directly from the
airport to meet you all.

720
00:56:34,062 --> 00:56:36,541
l'll come some other day.
- Child, this is your house.

721
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:39,301
Yes. Greetings.

722
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:44,861
What a nice boy!
- And shy, too.

723
00:56:45,662 --> 00:56:47,101
Listen!

724
00:56:49,862 --> 00:56:51,381
Are you leaving?

725
00:56:53,502 --> 00:56:56,181
Wouldn't you have tea?
- No.

726
00:57:05,182 --> 00:57:07,541
Yes, Radha was a servant here.

727
00:57:10,502 --> 00:57:11,781
Do you know where she lives?

728
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:13,941
ln the Jawahar Nagar,
near the post office.

729
00:57:22,902 --> 00:57:26,341
Listen! Do you live in this area?
- Yes, why?

730
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:28,661
l'm looking for a girl. Perhaps
you might be knowing her.

731
00:57:28,742 --> 00:57:30,821
What's her name?
- Her name is Radha.

732
00:57:31,742 --> 00:57:34,261
Shankar, note the name he said.

733
00:57:34,342 --> 00:57:38,261
You were already one. Now we've
found another lover of Radha.

734
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:40,941
What?
- This is nothing.

735
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:43,821
Don't know how many more lovers
we'll find of Radha.

736
00:57:43,902 --> 00:57:45,061
What rubbish are you talking?

737
00:57:45,142 --> 00:57:47,981
A girl named Radha lived
in this locality.

738
00:57:48,222 --> 00:57:52,101
She's run away after losing her
prestige and defaming this locality.

739
00:57:52,182 --> 00:57:55,261
Shut up! l only asked you
the address of Radha.

740
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:58,341
You could have asked anyone
the address of that wicked.

741
00:57:58,862 --> 00:58:00,101
Go straight.

742
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:02,101
Turn left. It is the 1st building,
on the ground floor.

743
00:58:04,902 --> 00:58:07,341
Looks like he's deeply hurt.

744
00:58:07,582 --> 00:58:10,261
Come on, guru. We're getting Iate.
Start the car.

745
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:12,541
Don't defame yourself..

746
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,381
..by saying the name
of that immoral girl.

747
00:58:14,462 --> 00:58:17,141
You seem to be from a decent family.

748
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,821
Don't know how many boys' lives
that witch has ruined.

749
00:58:20,982 --> 00:58:25,661
But you must have asked whose
child she was carrying.

750
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:27,421
Whose child?

751
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:35,221
Tell me, is the water of this glass
from a tap, a river or a well?

752
00:58:35,742 --> 00:58:39,661
What? - An immoral girl doesn't
have only one lover.

753
00:58:39,742 --> 00:58:41,741
Do you know what a girl..

754
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,781
..who is going to be a mother
without marriage is called?

755
00:58:43,862 --> 00:58:49,981
Degraded! Can a prostitute tell
whose child is she carrying?

756
00:58:50,062 --> 00:58:51,701
You are saying such bad things
despite being her mother?

757
00:58:54,382 --> 00:58:56,981
Don't ever come here again.

758
00:59:06,702 --> 00:59:08,301
Are you ready, Syam?

759
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:11,181
Why is it dark?

760
00:59:13,782 --> 00:59:15,981
You're not ready yet?

761
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:21,301
Father, l.. l have a headache.
l won't go, father.

762
00:59:21,382 --> 00:59:23,061
You're giving an excuse.

763
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,541
What will l say to Shivcharan..

764
00:59:24,622 --> 00:59:26,541
..if you don't attend your
own engagement party?

765
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:30,021
What happened? - l don't want
to get married so soon, father.

766
00:59:30,102 --> 00:59:31,421
Why don't you want to marry?

767
00:59:31,502 --> 00:59:35,461
l want to help you with the
business first, and get settled.

768
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:37,701
You can do that after marriage, too.

769
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,661
ln fact, a person settles
down only after marriage.

770
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,941
And don't forget, Shyam, that
l've promised Shivcharan.

771
00:59:43,182 --> 00:59:47,221
And you also like the girl,
don't you? - Yes, father.

772
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:49,541
Get ready then. l'll
be waiting for you.

773
00:59:49,622 --> 00:59:54,101
Don't be so annoying, bro. Get
ready fast. We're getting late.

774
01:00:15,422 --> 01:00:16,941
Have sweets, dear.

775
01:00:17,022 --> 01:00:19,461
Yes, Bhabhi have it.
- No, you take first.

776
01:00:20,302 --> 01:00:23,541
Shivcharan, you're free now.
- How's that?

777
01:00:23,622 --> 01:00:24,701
Your responsibilities will be over..

778
01:00:24,782 --> 01:00:25,941
..as soon as Mira's marriage
is completed.

779
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,701
Responsibilities never end.

780
01:00:27,782 --> 01:00:30,461
She is to be operated as soon
as we do Mira's marriage.

781
01:00:30,542 --> 01:00:33,501
l want Mira's wedding to be
done as soon as possible.

782
01:00:33,582 --> 01:00:34,821
Why wait then?

783
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:38,421
l also want to get her married as
soon as Shyam's marriage is done.

784
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:40,261
Father!

785
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:44,781
Bhabhi, there's some
magic about you.

786
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:48,141
Bro was having a headache.
Now he's ok after seeing you.

787
01:00:48,222 --> 01:00:49,621
Will you have coffee?

788
01:00:54,702 --> 01:00:57,021
And you, bro? - No, Rekha.

789
01:00:57,382 --> 01:01:00,501
Please, have some. - No.

790
01:01:31,342 --> 01:01:33,661
l want to ask you something.

791
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:38,661
l wanted to ask yesterday.
But you left soon.

792
01:01:40,422 --> 01:01:45,461
We both are educated. And we are
brought up in this new era.

793
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,301
What do you want to say?

794
01:01:47,502 --> 01:01:53,821
That l'm an Indian girl. l can't
go against my parents' wish.

795
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:59,061
You are a man. There are no
restrictions for you.

796
01:01:59,142 --> 01:02:01,141
l don't get you.

797
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:06,701
This party today is a lifelong
decision for you and me.

798
01:02:07,622 --> 01:02:12,341
lf you love someone else,
iust say yes.

799
01:02:13,662 --> 01:02:15,861
l'll refuse the marriage.

800
01:02:16,222 --> 01:02:18,141
You'll be freed.

801
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,821
Shankar, note the name he said.

802
01:02:20,902 --> 01:02:23,261
An immoral girl doesn't
have only one lover.

803
01:02:23,342 --> 01:02:25,421
Do you know what a girl..

804
01:02:25,502 --> 01:02:27,421
..who is going to be a mother
without marriage is called?

805
01:02:27,502 --> 01:02:28,581
Degraded!

806
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,261
A girl named Radha lived
in this locality.

807
01:02:31,342 --> 01:02:34,781
She's run away after losing her
prestige and defaming this locality.

808
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:37,181
And you also like the
girl, don't you?

809
01:02:43,822 --> 01:02:45,981
You didn't answer me.

810
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:53,781
Believe me, l want to be your
wife, not a burden on you.

811
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:59,941
You've got me wrong. - l felt
as if you didn't want to marry.

812
01:03:00,022 --> 01:03:03,661
Yes, l didn't want to marry.
Because l didn't know you.

813
01:03:04,022 --> 01:03:09,941
But suddenly in these few moments
l've known you well.

814
01:03:21,582 --> 01:03:24,021
Don't ever let this thought
pass your mind..

815
01:03:24,102 --> 01:03:29,181
..that there can a place for anyone
except you in my heart.

816
01:03:45,662 --> 01:03:48,381
ls he sleeping?
- Yes, he went to sleep just now.

817
01:03:49,462 --> 01:03:53,101
What will you name him?
- Haven't thought yet.

818
01:03:53,702 --> 01:03:55,781
lt is the father who usually
names a child.

819
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:59,941
Radha, l haven't asked
you anything till now.

820
01:04:00,582 --> 01:04:02,061
Today l only want to ask that..

821
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:04,901
..will his father back
off from accepting you?

822
01:04:04,982 --> 01:04:10,941
l fully trust him. But he
has gone out of India.

823
01:04:11,022 --> 01:04:14,421
l only want you to marry him
and live a respectable life.

824
01:04:15,502 --> 01:04:20,741
And yes, it's Mira's wedding today.
l forgot to tell you.

825
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:25,421
l got the invitation card this
morning. Ok, l'll leave now.

826
01:04:26,142 --> 01:04:28,261
You're going to attend the
wedding, right? - Yes.

827
01:04:29,262 --> 01:04:31,621
l can't give Mira
anything right now.

828
01:04:32,982 --> 01:04:36,421
But say congratulations
on my behalf. - Sure.

829
01:04:50,262 --> 01:04:53,421
Shyam? Mira?

830
01:04:55,542 --> 01:04:59,341
No, l can't believe this.

831
01:05:00,942 --> 01:05:04,261
This is not possible. Not at all.

832
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:07,461
l won't let this marriage take place.

833
01:05:07,902 --> 01:05:10,301
l'll never let it take place!

834
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:26,381
Drive fast, brother.

835
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:37,261
Drive faster!

836
01:05:44,742 --> 01:05:47,021
l have to reach there quickly.

837
01:05:52,462 --> 01:05:56,221
Reach me there quickly,
bro. Drive faster.

838
01:06:33,142 --> 01:06:35,741
May God give everyone
a daughter like you!

839
01:06:36,342 --> 01:06:40,461
Just remember this advice
of your mother.

840
01:06:41,302 --> 01:06:43,021
Husband is God!

841
01:06:43,742 --> 01:06:48,221
Accept his
faults and cover them.

842
01:06:48,982 --> 01:06:53,261
lt is a woman's religion and duty.

843
01:06:56,902 --> 01:07:00,581
Come, child. Everyone's waiting.

844
01:07:06,942 --> 01:07:08,941
Be happy, child.

845
01:07:10,142 --> 01:07:16,101
Take care of mother, uncle Dinu.

846
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:37,141
Uncle Dinu, whose child is this?

847
01:07:37,622 --> 01:07:40,261
Many people have come to the
marriage. Must be of one of them.

848
01:07:55,742 --> 01:08:00,541
Sister, what was mine till
yesterday is yours now.

849
01:08:00,822 --> 01:08:03,541
Your husband Shyam..

850
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:07,061
..had accepted me as his
wife in front of God.

851
01:08:07,422 --> 01:08:09,421
And this child is the sign of that.

852
01:08:11,382 --> 01:08:15,421
l don't know for which mistake
of mine is Shyam punishing me.

853
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:20,621
lf l could reach before
the marriage circles..

854
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:23,780
..l would have never let
this marriage take place.

855
01:08:24,341 --> 01:08:27,780
But my life was to be ruined.
And it is ruined.

856
01:08:28,421 --> 01:08:30,660
May God always keep you happy!

857
01:08:31,502 --> 01:08:33,541
When you might be reading
this letter..

858
01:08:33,982 --> 01:08:37,061
..l would be far away
from your life.

859
01:08:37,902 --> 01:08:40,781
This is a request from
an unlucky woman.

860
01:08:41,462 --> 01:08:45,941
Accept this child and
get him his right.

861
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:50,021
Because your husband is his father.

862
01:08:51,142 --> 01:08:54,501
l have only one proof
to make you believe me.

863
01:08:55,142 --> 01:08:58,821
Shyam's letter, which he had
written to me from England.

864
01:08:59,822 --> 01:09:02,821
l am writing this letter at
the back of that letter.

865
01:09:10,462 --> 01:09:12,421
Banne Khan!
- Yes, bro.

866
01:09:12,502 --> 01:09:14,861
The marriage procession is going
to leave from here soon.

867
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:17,221
Someone should stay there to
receive the groom and the bride.

868
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:20,380
l'll go then. l'll keep the
garlands and other things ready.

869
01:09:20,462 --> 01:09:22,341
You bring along the
groom and the bride.

870
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:24,220
l was iust going to say
that. Take my car.

871
01:09:24,301 --> 01:09:26,580
Bro, the car gets trapped
in the traffic.

872
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,541
A cycle comes in handy
while in hurry.

873
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:31,021
Just paddle it and you
reach where you want.

874
01:09:31,102 --> 01:09:32,941
l'll go through the shortcut.

875
01:09:48,622 --> 01:09:52,341
Here, bro, take the ioker. - Forget
the joker. Look at that queen.

876
01:10:03,662 --> 01:10:08,061
Who are you? Let go of
me. l say leave me.

877
01:10:08,142 --> 01:10:13,021
What will we do if we leave you?
- l will tell you what to do.

878
01:10:13,102 --> 01:10:17,221
First you leave this girl.
- Move forward.

879
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:20,181
Look, mister, if l move forward..

880
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:23,141
..you'll find your teeth
broken in your hands.

881
01:10:23,222 --> 01:10:26,061
ls it? Here, take care of the queen.

882
01:10:29,502 --> 01:10:34,381
Misters, you are acting smart. Save
yourself, or you'll get smashed.

883
01:10:35,782 --> 01:10:40,101
l redden my mouth with a Paan.
And that of others with a slap.

884
01:10:43,502 --> 01:10:45,781
O Lord! Scared so soon?

885
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,981
Did you see that Bhopali trick?

886
01:11:18,822 --> 01:11:21,021
Run away!

887
01:11:25,102 --> 01:11:29,581
You are strange, child! Is this
the time to go out at night?

888
01:11:29,902 --> 01:11:34,061
Thank God that l came over.
Come, l'll drop you home.

889
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:38,701
Thank you very much.
l'll go by myself.

890
01:11:38,782 --> 01:11:41,701
Don't act childish. l'm
bringing the cycle.

891
01:11:41,782 --> 01:11:44,341
Sit on the carrier.
l'll drop you home.

892
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:10,021
Till now Mira was crazy of Shyam.

893
01:12:11,142 --> 01:12:13,301
But from today Shyam
is a devotee of Mira.

894
01:12:20,062 --> 01:12:22,541
You're comparing me
with that goddess?

895
01:12:22,942 --> 01:12:27,541
You're no less than a goddess. l had
understood it in a single meeting.

896
01:12:29,422 --> 01:12:34,461
Your beauty is as clear
and pure as your name.

897
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:42,301
Come. Let me add 4 stars
to your beauty.

898
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:45,141
This is a gift from my late mother.

899
01:12:46,102 --> 01:12:50,421
lt was her last wish that her
daughter in law wears this.

900
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:58,261
Before accepting mother's gift,
l want to tell you something.

901
01:12:58,742 --> 01:13:00,341
Yes, tell me.

902
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:02,861
First promise me that..

903
01:13:02,982 --> 01:13:05,421
..even if you find my words
unpleasant you'll forgive me.

904
01:13:05,502 --> 01:13:07,741
l promise you and l forgive you.

905
01:13:10,542 --> 01:13:16,581
Think well. It's easy to promise.
But as much difficult to fulfill.

906
01:13:16,662 --> 01:13:19,221
Try me. Just say what you want.

907
01:13:19,302 --> 01:13:21,981
l'll listen with a smile
and forgive with a laugh.

908
01:13:23,502 --> 01:13:27,781
l.. l am a mother of a child!
- What?

909
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:30,381
l am a mother of a child.

910
01:13:34,862 --> 01:13:38,901
lf you hadn't promised to forgive
me, l wouldn't have said this.

911
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:41,541
Keep quiet!
- You said just now that..

912
01:13:41,622 --> 01:13:44,421
..you'll listen with a smile
and forgive with a laugh.

913
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:48,061
l'll be ruined if you break your
promise. Please, save my prestige.

914
01:13:48,142 --> 01:13:54,781
Accept this child and give him a
father's love and a child's right.

915
01:13:56,462 --> 01:14:00,301
A father's love? Go away from here.

916
01:15:03,382 --> 01:15:07,061
Bro, father is not feeling
well suddenly. Come fast.

917
01:15:07,582 --> 01:15:11,301
Where's she? - Who she? Bhabhi?
She's with father.

918
01:15:26,182 --> 01:15:30,061
Enough, Shyam! Look at me,
too! l'm not well.

919
01:15:30,342 --> 01:15:31,541
How are you now, father?

920
01:15:31,622 --> 01:15:34,221
l'm fine but this doctor
says that l'm not well.

921
01:15:34,302 --> 01:15:37,661
You shouldn't take it as
a joke. You need rest.

922
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:41,181
What else am l doing? - Look,
child, don't let him get out of bed.

923
01:15:41,262 --> 01:15:43,541
How many restrictions
will you lay on me?

924
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,421
You stopped my practicing. You
stopped me from going to the office.

925
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:50,141
You don't need to work while
Shyam is here. You need rest.

926
01:15:50,222 --> 01:15:55,021
Take this doctor from here. - l'll
come back at 3 o'clock to see you.

927
01:15:55,102 --> 01:16:00,501
Why are you after me? Go! Come,
daughter in law. Sit.

928
01:16:00,902 --> 01:16:05,141
l'll bring iuice for you. - Wait!
There's no need for the juice.

929
01:16:05,222 --> 01:16:08,701
Can you bring milk with almonds?

930
01:16:08,782 --> 01:16:11,141
Then l don't need it.
Give it to Shyam.

931
01:16:16,942 --> 01:16:21,901
Look, child, grief isn't lessened
by crying. You've been crying a lot.

932
01:16:22,822 --> 01:16:27,581
Why did you save me? l wanted
to die.

933
01:16:29,222 --> 01:16:31,061
l am a criminal.

934
01:16:31,342 --> 01:16:35,141
How can l believe that? You
told me your name is Radha.

935
01:16:35,862 --> 01:16:37,901
A person with such a name
cannot commit any crime.

936
01:16:39,382 --> 01:16:44,381
Yes, the day Radha commits a crime,
the whole world will be a criminal.

937
01:16:46,262 --> 01:16:50,341
l want to go from here now. - But
first tell me where will you go.

938
01:16:50,862 --> 01:16:53,981
l don't know myself.
- Then stay here.

939
01:16:54,742 --> 01:16:57,541
l don't have a sister.
You be my sister.

940
01:16:58,022 --> 01:17:02,301
Let me be your bro. l swear on
God l won't let you complain.

941
01:17:04,342 --> 01:17:07,901
l will give my life for
you if needed. Test me.

942
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:18,661
Brother! - Child, l had been
wanting a sis since childhood.

943
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:23,021
But fate didn't give me one.
Now God has given me.

944
01:17:38,622 --> 01:17:49,821
You are a guardian of all.
l've heard a lot about you.

945
01:17:49,902 --> 01:17:59,501
You are a guardian of all.
l've heard a lot about you.

946
01:18:01,062 --> 01:18:12,541
But l'll believe you only when
you solve my problem, Shyam.

947
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:23,816
You are a guardian of all.

948
01:18:43,062 --> 01:18:54,021
Listen to my request.
Just do me this favor.

949
01:18:54,222 --> 01:19:05,341
Return the person from whom
you've seized his right.

950
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:16,659
To save the dignity of my promise..

951
01:19:16,982 --> 01:19:23,141
..is your duty now.

952
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:33,729
You are a guardian of all.

953
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:38,291
l've heard a lot about you.

954
01:19:56,173 --> 01:20:07,221
Those who come to your refuge
meet success in life.

955
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:18,181
l'm unlucky even after getting
married. What is my mistake?

956
01:20:18,382 --> 01:20:34,661
O Lord of the world, O God,
l bow down to you.

957
01:20:40,844 --> 01:20:50,746
You are a guardian of all.
l've heard a lot about you.

958
01:20:51,828 --> 01:21:03,004
But l'll believe you only when
you solve my problem, Shyam.

959
01:21:03,265 --> 01:21:08,388
When you solve my problem, Shyam.

960
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:13,859
You are a guardian of all.

961
01:21:18,342 --> 01:21:19,581
Father?

962
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:29,661
God bless you, child. - Father, the
doctor has told you to stay in bed.

963
01:21:29,742 --> 01:21:32,621
Please, rest.
- l was resting.

964
01:21:32,702 --> 01:21:37,101
Listening to the Aarti after so
many days, l remembered my sister.

965
01:21:37,422 --> 01:21:44,581
She also used to do the Aarti here.
Subhadra, she was my only sis.

966
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:49,581
She and her husband were killed
in a motor accident.

967
01:21:51,342 --> 01:21:53,261
Shyam was 6 years old at that time.

968
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:56,821
Child, l haven't let him feel
that lack of anything till now.

969
01:21:58,582 --> 01:22:02,821
lf you have any problem,
you can also tell me.

970
01:22:02,902 --> 01:22:07,021
Father! - What is it, child?
Why these tears in your eyes?

971
01:22:10,462 --> 01:22:16,341
Father, l'm in a dilemma.

972
01:22:16,782 --> 01:22:19,861
That's what l want to ask you,
child. What's the dilemma?

973
01:22:20,462 --> 01:22:22,261
Father,

974
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:30,021
l had a friend.
She married last year.

975
01:22:30,782 --> 01:22:34,101
And her husband left
her within 6 months.

976
01:22:34,822 --> 01:22:37,141
She couldn't bear the shock.

977
01:22:39,022 --> 01:22:42,941
She died leaving with
me an 8 days old child.

978
01:22:43,942 --> 01:22:48,501
Father, l don't understand
what should l do?

979
01:22:51,062 --> 01:22:54,701
Where's that child?
- With my mother.

980
01:22:55,822 --> 01:22:58,061
And she's going out of
town for her operation.

981
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:03,101
Have you thought what
you want to do?

982
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:09,181
Yes, l think l will send
him to the orphanage.

983
01:23:09,662 --> 01:23:14,541
Orphanage? Your friend could
have done that if she wished.

984
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:16,101
But your friend trusted you..

985
01:23:16,182 --> 01:23:18,261
..that's why she handed over
the child to you, right?

986
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:24,301
Yes, father. - What's the confusion
then? Bring the child here.

987
01:23:26,062 --> 01:23:29,261
Here? - Yes, your confusion
will be solved.

988
01:23:29,342 --> 01:23:31,421
And l'll also have a good time.

989
01:23:31,502 --> 01:23:34,021
This is better, daughter.
Bring the child here.

990
01:23:45,622 --> 01:23:50,581
Strange! People think of going
home early after marriage.

991
01:23:50,662 --> 01:23:54,461
And you're still here? Go, bro.
Bhabhi must be waiting for you.

992
01:23:54,542 --> 01:23:57,021
Shut up, Raian!
- Why? Did l say anything wrong?

993
01:23:57,102 --> 01:23:59,861
l'm not in the mood for a iest.
Tell me if you have some work.

994
01:24:00,262 --> 01:24:04,541
The thing is that the staff wants
a party for your marriage.

995
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:06,981
There's no need for a party.

996
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:11,541
Sorry, Raian. l'm very tensed
at the moment. Please, go.

997
01:24:20,062 --> 01:24:21,541
How are you feeling now, father?

998
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:23,261
l wasn't well, but now l'm fine.

999
01:24:23,342 --> 01:24:26,661
See. Daughter in law has brought
me a nice toy to play with.

1000
01:24:27,142 --> 01:24:30,061
Whose' that child? - It is daughter
in law's friend's orphan child.

1001
01:24:31,302 --> 01:24:34,541
Father, l want to
tell you something.

1002
01:24:35,102 --> 01:24:39,341
What is it? Why are you
upset? Take the call.

1003
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:47,901
Shyam? Look, child, l've taken the
cardiogram of your father today.

1004
01:24:48,262 --> 01:24:53,701
The condition of his heart is not
ok. - What? His condition is not ok?

1005
01:24:53,782 --> 01:24:59,101
There's nothing to worry. He
only needs a lot of rest.

1006
01:25:01,302 --> 01:25:07,981
Yes. Ok. All right.

1007
01:25:21,222 --> 01:25:23,741
Whose call was it?
- Doctor's.

1008
01:25:23,822 --> 01:25:27,101
l know he must have said
that l need rest. - Yes.

1009
01:25:27,182 --> 01:25:29,541
Shyam, l have nothing else
to do except rest now.

1010
01:25:29,622 --> 01:25:32,341
All my worries are gone after
daughter in law has arrived.

1011
01:25:32,422 --> 01:25:36,821
l wish God gives such a nice
daughter in law to every one.

1012
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:40,781
What were you saying at that time?
- Nothing, father. l forgot.

1013
01:25:40,862 --> 01:25:42,581
So it wasn't something important.
- Yes, father.

1014
01:25:42,662 --> 01:25:45,301
Then go and change. Daughter
in law is waiting for you.

1015
01:25:45,622 --> 01:25:51,501
Dear, don't know whose child you
are. But l've become your grandpa!

1016
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:01,341
How dare you bring that
child in this house?

1017
01:26:02,382 --> 01:26:06,501
l was forced by my maternal love.
l couldn't live without the child.

1018
01:26:06,582 --> 01:26:08,381
lf you weren't ashamed
of telling me..

1019
01:26:08,462 --> 01:26:10,581
..why did you hide the
reality from father?

1020
01:26:10,982 --> 01:26:13,861
He is a father. And
you are my husband.

1021
01:26:14,422 --> 01:26:16,341
lt is my duty to respect father.

1022
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:19,301
Duty? Teach me this nice drama, too.

1023
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,701
So that l can also play the
role of your husband forever.

1024
01:26:21,782 --> 01:26:23,781
lt would be better
if you forgive me.

1025
01:26:23,862 --> 01:26:25,781
l am ready to repent
the way you ask.

1026
01:26:25,862 --> 01:26:28,941
Go and drown yourself. And
also take that child along.

1027
01:26:29,022 --> 01:26:31,461
He cannot live here.
- He will stay here.

1028
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:33,861
l've taken the permission of father.

1029
01:26:33,942 --> 01:26:35,541
Father treats you like a goddess.

1030
01:26:35,622 --> 01:26:38,421
l could have shown your real self
to him. But l'm helpless.

1031
01:26:38,502 --> 01:26:40,261
He cannot bear such a big shock.

1032
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:43,781
And you want to take the advantage
of his helplessness.

1033
01:26:43,862 --> 01:26:48,941
No. l only want to ask that,
who does not make mistakes?

1034
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:51,741
lf you had done a mistake..
- Mira!

1035
01:26:52,222 --> 01:26:54,621
What is that child's fault?

1036
01:26:54,702 --> 01:26:58,261
lt's not written on his
fate who his father is.

1037
01:26:58,822 --> 01:27:01,661
You can consider him
your own if you wish.

1038
01:27:02,102 --> 01:27:04,021
lt is impossible!

1039
01:27:05,502 --> 01:27:08,781
Child, come out.

1040
01:27:13,382 --> 01:27:16,301
Here.
- What is it? - These are saris.

1041
01:27:16,662 --> 01:27:19,821
You don't ask anything by yourself.
So l brought them.

1042
01:27:21,622 --> 01:27:23,101
But why did you bring them?

1043
01:27:23,182 --> 01:27:27,661
You can do with old, dirty clothes.
But people will blame me.

1044
01:27:29,582 --> 01:27:31,701
Yes, child. People will say that ..

1045
01:27:31,782 --> 01:27:34,061
..hunter Banne Khlt is the iniustice
of naturean Bhopali is a scoundrel.

1046
01:27:34,142 --> 01:27:35,661
Doesn't care for his sister.

1047
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,581
How many more favors will
you to do me, bro?

1048
01:27:39,022 --> 01:27:41,301
How long will l be a burden on you?

1049
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:45,261
You are mocking the relation
between a sister and a brother.

1050
01:27:46,102 --> 01:27:48,901
Are you embarrassing me?
- It's not that, bro.

1051
01:27:49,822 --> 01:27:54,941
l mean, what else have l done
except resting after l came here?

1052
01:27:55,022 --> 01:28:00,021
You've done wonders! You've turned
this shed into a house.

1053
01:28:00,262 --> 01:28:02,861
l don't see any cobwebs.

1054
01:28:02,942 --> 01:28:05,901
Mosquitoes have run
off besides the bugs.

1055
01:28:05,982 --> 01:28:08,141
Joseph!
- Yes, master.

1056
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:11,461
Was a stove burnt in this house
before madam's arrival?

1057
01:28:12,022 --> 01:28:16,181
Only the rats ran here and there,
master. - See? l forgot the rats.

1058
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:24,341
Bro, will you accept my request?
- Just tell me.

1059
01:28:25,262 --> 01:28:27,061
l want to do a iob.

1060
01:28:29,062 --> 01:28:32,941
How did you think of that?
Why would you work?

1061
01:28:33,702 --> 01:28:37,461
l am bored at home. l don't
have anywhere to go.

1062
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:39,621
l don't have a friend either.

1063
01:28:40,422 --> 01:28:42,821
As it is all the girls
work nowadays, bro.

1064
01:28:43,422 --> 01:28:48,061
lf l work, l'll feel better.
- You are right.

1065
01:28:49,182 --> 01:28:50,901
Shall l start looking for
a job from tomorrow then?

1066
01:28:50,982 --> 01:28:54,661
Why should you look? l'll
get a job for you. - You?

1067
01:28:54,742 --> 01:29:00,581
Just see, child. l deal in cycles.
But l have friends who own motors.

1068
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:02,661
l'll take you tomorrow morning.

1069
01:29:02,742 --> 01:29:06,061
Come on. Get me tea.
- l'll get it right away.

1070
01:29:22,622 --> 01:29:24,821
Come.
- Why did you bring me here, bro?

1071
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:29,181
My friend lives here. Come in. Come.

1072
01:29:31,662 --> 01:29:37,701
Don't cry. Drink milk.
- Greetings, bro.

1073
01:29:37,782 --> 01:29:39,861
Come, Banne Khan. Look
what a trouble l am in.

1074
01:29:39,942 --> 01:29:42,181
What is this, bro?
- Grandchild.

1075
01:29:42,262 --> 01:29:43,781
What are you saying?

1076
01:29:43,862 --> 01:29:45,341
Our daughter in law arrived in this
house just a few days back.

1077
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:47,101
Where did this child come from?
- It's not my grandchild.

1078
01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:48,541
lt is daughter in law's
friend's orphan child.

1079
01:29:48,622 --> 01:29:51,341
l've made him my grandchild.
Here. He's gone to sleep.

1080
01:29:51,422 --> 01:29:53,821
lt is the iniustice of nature.

1081
01:29:53,902 --> 01:29:57,101
lt has given bottle to
such a little child.

1082
01:29:57,182 --> 01:29:58,821
That's the sad thing, Banne Khan.

1083
01:29:58,902 --> 01:30:01,901
Give him to me. l'll drink
the milk to him.

1084
01:30:04,142 --> 01:30:07,181
Be careful. Here.

1085
01:30:12,742 --> 01:30:16,461
Who is this girl with you?
- Radha? She is my sister.

1086
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:18,021
Your sis?
- Yes, bro.

1087
01:30:18,102 --> 01:30:21,221
Just the way you made him your
grandchild, l made her my sis.

1088
01:30:21,302 --> 01:30:22,701
She is well educated.

1089
01:30:22,782 --> 01:30:25,581
She was going to commit suicide
tired of her step mother.

1090
01:30:25,862 --> 01:30:28,741
l brought her to my house. Have
l done the right thing?

1091
01:30:29,062 --> 01:30:31,421
You've done a very good
thing. Come. Sit.

1092
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:35,141
This is great, Banne Khan.

1093
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:38,181
l have a grandchild.
You have a sister.

1094
01:30:38,822 --> 01:30:42,701
But the thing is, bro, that
l have a problem now?

1095
01:30:42,782 --> 01:30:46,381
What problem?
- She says she is bored at home.

1096
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:51,181
She wants to work. Convinced by
her, l agreed to that last night.

1097
01:30:51,262 --> 01:30:55,061
So l've brought her here to you.
But now l feel ashamed.

1098
01:30:55,142 --> 01:30:57,901
Ashamed for what?
- You are strange.

1099
01:30:58,342 --> 01:30:59,981
Would a sister work as
Iong as bro is alive?

1100
01:31:00,062 --> 01:31:02,101
lsn't it shameful?

1101
01:31:02,182 --> 01:31:05,821
You considered her sister and
gave her a place to live.

1102
01:31:05,902 --> 01:31:08,541
Now if she wants to work for
amusement, what's wrong with that?

1103
01:31:08,622 --> 01:31:13,061
You've relieved me, bro.
Now do me one more favor.

1104
01:31:13,142 --> 01:31:15,461
Tell me.
- Get my sister a job somewhere.

1105
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:17,261
Why somewhere else? l'll give
her a job in my own office.

1106
01:31:17,342 --> 01:31:19,461
You said she's educated, right?
- Yes.

1107
01:31:19,542 --> 01:31:21,621
Then send her to my office.
l'll talk to Shyam about her.

1108
01:31:21,702 --> 01:31:24,421
Did you hear that, child?

1109
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:30,221
The arrangement
for your amusement is done.

1110
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:34,781
You've got a iob in
brother's office. Yes, come.

1111
01:31:36,102 --> 01:31:39,821
Lay him in the pram. Here, bro.
The bottle's empty.

1112
01:31:40,262 --> 01:31:43,101
Did you give him all the milk?
- Yes, he's also asleep.

1113
01:31:43,462 --> 01:31:45,381
She's done wonders!

1114
01:31:45,622 --> 01:31:49,341
She made him sleep like
a mother does to her child.

1115
01:31:49,902 --> 01:31:53,901
After all, it's girls who become
mothers. - That's true, bro.

1116
01:32:21,053 --> 01:32:22,212
You?

1117
01:32:22,893 --> 01:32:25,412
l'd thought l would find you here.

1118
01:32:26,653 --> 01:32:28,812
But l didn't expect
you to recognize me.

1119
01:32:29,733 --> 01:32:30,892
Congratulations for your marriage.

1120
01:32:30,973 --> 01:32:36,692
Radha, l don't want
to see your face.

1121
01:32:37,973 --> 01:32:39,412
But now that
you've suddenly come here..

1122
01:32:39,493 --> 01:32:42,572
..tell me why did you cheat me?

1123
01:32:43,373 --> 01:32:44,812
Why were you disloyal to me?

1124
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:49,132
Very good! You ruined my life.

1125
01:32:49,893 --> 01:32:51,852
And now you are accusing me of
disloyalty?

1126
01:32:52,293 --> 01:32:54,412
Don't try to fool me, Radha.

1127
01:32:55,293 --> 01:32:57,692
As soon as l came from England,
l looked for you.

1128
01:32:58,253 --> 01:33:01,612
Whatever l heard about you from
Shankar and then your mother.

1129
01:33:01,693 --> 01:33:03,172
You believed it!

1130
01:33:04,053 --> 01:33:09,532
And forgot the one who had
trusted and surrendered to you.

1131
01:33:10,813 --> 01:33:13,252
You went away after amusing
yourself for sometime.

1132
01:33:14,013 --> 01:33:16,332
And l was unable to face the world.

1133
01:33:17,493 --> 01:33:19,652
l was going to be
the mother of your child.

1134
01:33:20,213 --> 01:33:22,812
Don't try to accuse me
for someone else's mistake, Radha.

1135
01:33:23,253 --> 01:33:28,572
Accuse you? And what if
l prove that that child is yours?

1136
01:33:29,373 --> 01:33:32,492
Where is that child?
- Will you give him his rights?

1137
01:33:34,773 --> 01:33:35,892
Will you be able to accept
in front of everyone ..

1138
01:33:35,973 --> 01:33:37,092
.. that it is your child?

1139
01:33:38,693 --> 01:33:41,772
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

1140
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:49,892
Mr. Shyam, forget your child
just as you forgot me.

1141
01:33:51,533 --> 01:33:57,052
lt wasn't your fault. It was mine.
l've got the punishment.

1142
01:34:02,933 --> 01:34:08,092
Only God knows whether it is you
or me who got the punishment.

1143
01:34:17,653 --> 01:34:19,932
l couldn't forget my child.

1144
01:34:20,693 --> 01:34:23,452
l found the excuse of
a iob to go out of the house.

1145
01:34:24,013 --> 01:34:26,132
But look at my misfortune,
Shanti.

1146
01:34:26,693 --> 01:34:28,492
Brother Banne took me to the house of
the same person..

1147
01:34:28,573 --> 01:34:32,692
..who ruined my life and forced
my child to live like an orphan.

1148
01:34:32,973 --> 01:34:36,492
Now tell me,
how can l work in that office?

1149
01:34:36,573 --> 01:34:39,492
What will you answer bro Banne
if you don't work in that office?

1150
01:34:40,293 --> 01:34:41,852
l don't understand anything.

1151
01:34:43,573 --> 01:34:46,052
How much more will
l pay for a single mistake?

1152
01:34:47,853 --> 01:34:50,172
All problems would have been solved
if l had died.

1153
01:34:50,253 --> 01:34:52,812
Silly, what do you have
to do with Shyam now?

1154
01:34:53,013 --> 01:34:55,252
l think God has sent you purposely..

1155
01:34:55,333 --> 01:34:57,692
..to that office after listening
to your maternal call.

1156
01:34:57,893 --> 01:34:59,212
Either with bro Banne..

1157
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:03,252
..or through office, you can see
your child and take care of him.

1158
01:35:03,493 --> 01:35:05,092
You are alive for that.

1159
01:35:06,733 --> 01:35:09,052
Start going to
the office from tomorrow.

1160
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:12,372
And if Shyam ever tries
to fall for you again..

1161
01:35:12,453 --> 01:35:15,252
..remember that he is
Mira's husband now.

1162
01:35:17,373 --> 01:35:22,492
l'm already blemished.
But l'm not so low..

1163
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,252
..that l'd have an affair
with the husband of that goddess..

1164
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:30,292
..to whom me and my child
are indebted for life.

1165
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:33,012
l know that, Radha.

1166
01:35:42,293 --> 01:35:46,932
Darling Rekha,
l haven't seen you since yesterday.

1167
01:35:47,013 --> 01:35:51,652
What's your good name?
- Who are you?

1168
01:35:51,733 --> 01:35:56,132
l am Rekha's Bhabhi.
- Bh.. Bhabhi, greetings.

1169
01:35:56,213 --> 01:36:01,092
l am Deepak.
- How do you know Rekha?

1170
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:04,892
We're in the same college
and the same class.

1171
01:36:04,973 --> 01:36:07,732
Keep speaking.
- Keep speaking? Ok, l will.

1172
01:36:08,413 --> 01:36:12,572
Bhabhi, Rekha and me,
me and Rekha.. we both..

1173
01:36:13,373 --> 01:36:15,212
Hasn't Rekha told
you anything about me?

1174
01:36:15,293 --> 01:36:18,572
No, have you told anything
about Rekha to your parents?

1175
01:36:19,133 --> 01:36:21,292
No, not yet. But they
understood everything.

1176
01:36:21,373 --> 01:36:26,612
How's that? - l don't feel much
hungry. l can't sleep at nights.

1177
01:36:26,813 --> 01:36:28,692
l can't concentrate on studies.

1178
01:36:28,773 --> 01:36:30,772
When we asked the doctor..

1179
01:36:30,853 --> 01:36:32,572
..he said he doesn't
know what's wrong with me.

1180
01:36:32,653 --> 01:36:35,612
l got it. There's only
one cure for your ailment.

1181
01:36:35,973 --> 01:36:37,772
Bring your parents to our home.

1182
01:36:40,133 --> 01:36:42,092
Thank you.

1183
01:36:42,453 --> 01:36:46,772
The day l meet you, l'll bow
down my head at your feet.

1184
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:53,012
Here, talk to Rekha. - Who is it?
- Some guy called Deepak.

1185
01:36:54,533 --> 01:36:56,092
Why did you need to call here?

1186
01:36:56,493 --> 01:36:58,332
Yes, l'll return your book tomorrow.

1187
01:36:58,573 --> 01:37:00,372
Which book? What book?

1188
01:37:01,933 --> 01:37:07,732
Don't call here again. He's
such a bore! He studies with me.

1189
01:37:09,613 --> 01:37:13,332
Rekha, you
shouldn't call one a bore..

1190
01:37:13,853 --> 01:37:14,972
..with whom you're going
to spend all your life.

1191
01:37:15,613 --> 01:37:18,652
What?
- Deepak has told me everything.

1192
01:37:21,453 --> 01:37:22,652
Do you like him?

1193
01:37:27,373 --> 01:37:30,692
Look, you shouldn't
hide anything from Bhabhi.

1194
01:37:31,253 --> 01:37:33,532
After all it's me
who'll convince father.

1195
01:37:37,973 --> 01:37:41,652
Bhabhi, where's uncle? l've
some important work with him.

1196
01:37:41,813 --> 01:37:42,932
He's gone to the court.

1197
01:37:44,213 --> 01:37:46,332
Well, doesn't matter. l'll
come back in the evening.

1198
01:37:52,133 --> 01:37:55,812
Wow, Bhabhi! That's good.
- It's my notebook.

1199
01:37:56,493 --> 01:37:57,732
You write poems?

1200
01:37:57,933 --> 01:38:01,332
Well, l.. iust iot down a
few lines. Give it to me.

1201
01:38:01,773 --> 01:38:04,052
Now l'll return it only
after reading. - But..

1202
01:38:04,693 --> 01:38:07,092
l'm coming back in the evening.
l'll return it then.

1203
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:08,852
l'll leave now. Greetings.

1204
01:38:17,533 --> 01:38:20,412
Have you answered the letter
from income tax department? - Yes.

1205
01:38:21,253 --> 01:38:23,852
Have the notices
arrived from the court? - No.

1206
01:38:24,933 --> 01:38:28,252
Radha, it has been quite
some time since you joined here.

1207
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,612
But l haven't heard anything
except Yes and No from you.

1208
01:38:32,653 --> 01:38:35,452
Have you vowed to keep quiet?
- No.

1209
01:38:35,853 --> 01:38:40,452
Then say something. Talk
to me. You'll be relieved.

1210
01:38:40,733 --> 01:38:45,932
How can one be relieved to
whom life itself is a burden?

1211
01:38:46,333 --> 01:38:50,372
Radha, you think
there's no grief in my life?

1212
01:38:51,053 --> 01:38:54,772
There shouldn't be. What do you lack?

1213
01:38:55,493 --> 01:39:01,572
You have wealth, prestige and fame.
And a wife like a goddess.

1214
01:39:07,453 --> 01:39:08,812
A wife like a goddess?

1215
01:39:20,813 --> 01:39:21,972
Bhabhi!

1216
01:39:25,013 --> 01:39:30,492
Bhabhi! Are you Rekha's Bhabhi?
- Yes.

1217
01:39:32,013 --> 01:39:33,892
Hadn't l told you on the phone that..

1218
01:39:33,973 --> 01:39:37,932
..when l'll meet you, l'll
bow down to you? Like this.

1219
01:39:39,333 --> 01:39:41,612
You're Deepak, aren't you?
- Yes, l'm Deepak.

1220
01:39:42,173 --> 01:39:45,012
But Rekha had said that you were
going to come with your parents.

1221
01:39:45,093 --> 01:39:48,292
Yes, l've come. l mean
l've brought them with me.

1222
01:39:48,373 --> 01:39:51,412
But l've left them outside.
- But why?

1223
01:39:51,493 --> 01:39:54,492
Because if you don't like me,..

1224
01:39:54,573 --> 01:39:56,612
.. l'd be insulted in
front of my parents.

1225
01:39:57,133 --> 01:39:58,932
l see. Come. l'll call them in.
- Yes, come.

1226
01:40:18,093 --> 01:40:19,212
Come in.

1227
01:40:21,973 --> 01:40:24,892
Father, they are Deepak's parents.
- Sit.

1228
01:40:26,133 --> 01:40:27,652
Sit down, Deepak.

1229
01:40:29,493 --> 01:40:30,772
Daughter in law, bring Rekha here.

1230
01:40:33,853 --> 01:40:35,532
Do you own some business? -

1231
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:38,132
Yes, with your grace l
own a small clothes shop.

1232
01:40:38,213 --> 01:40:40,972
What are you saying, father?
- It's a shop measuring 100 x 60.

1233
01:40:41,053 --> 01:40:42,652
lt has 6 doors and
is filled with goods.

1234
01:40:42,733 --> 01:40:45,372
, Silk, Suti, woolen,
Khadi terrylene, terry coat..

1235
01:40:45,453 --> 01:40:46,892
..there are many goods worth lakhs.

1236
01:40:48,013 --> 01:40:49,772
Deepak, keep quiet!

1237
01:40:50,693 --> 01:40:54,252
l won't speak now, father.
You tell the matter now.

1238
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:59,652
The thing is, Mr. Sharma, that
we've seen Rekha. We like her.

1239
01:40:59,973 --> 01:41:03,732
Now if Rekha and Deepak get
married, it will be our good luck.

1240
01:41:03,813 --> 01:41:06,292
Mine, too. l mean ours.

1241
01:41:08,413 --> 01:41:14,532
Come, child. Sit.

1242
01:41:16,853 --> 01:41:18,332
Look, Mr. Devidayal..

1243
01:41:18,533 --> 01:41:20,932
..when the boy and the
girl have chosen each other..

1244
01:41:21,013 --> 01:41:22,892
..they must have
already decided for marriage.

1245
01:41:23,133 --> 01:41:25,172
We are only supposed to agree to that.

1246
01:41:28,133 --> 01:41:30,012
Here, sweeten your mouth for that.

1247
01:41:32,293 --> 01:41:38,772
Yes, child, take one. Have it.
- You have, too. - Yes.

1248
01:42:08,213 --> 01:42:11,292
Hey, you haven't gone yet? - l
had some important letters to type.

1249
01:42:11,373 --> 01:42:13,012
Then type one letter for me, too.

1250
01:42:15,933 --> 01:42:17,052
Tell me what you want to write.

1251
01:42:17,653 --> 01:42:21,732
Write, my sweetheart. You can
write darling if you like that.

1252
01:42:21,813 --> 01:42:24,092
Mr. Raian!
- l'm telling the truth, Radha.

1253
01:42:24,413 --> 01:42:27,332
Since the day you ioined this
office, l've given you many hints.

1254
01:42:27,413 --> 01:42:28,772
But you've never answered to any.

1255
01:42:28,853 --> 01:42:32,012
Look, l don't like
such conversation.

1256
01:42:32,093 --> 01:42:33,692
Why? Do you have any boyFriend?

1257
01:42:38,173 --> 01:42:41,412
l don't forget so easily,
Radha. l'll remember this slap.

1258
01:42:41,493 --> 01:42:44,692
And also remember that my
bro's name is Banne Khan.

1259
01:42:54,413 --> 01:42:56,972
Hunter Banne Khan Bhopali!

1260
01:42:57,053 --> 01:43:00,692
Hey, bro! Greetings.
- Greetings.

1261
01:43:00,773 --> 01:43:04,092
What brings you here?
- l've come to invite you. - For what?

1262
01:43:04,173 --> 01:43:05,932
Tomorrow is the child's birthday.
You have to come.

1263
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:07,812
l'll surely come.
- And also bring Radha with you.

1264
01:43:07,893 --> 01:43:09,572
You don't need to say that.

1265
01:43:09,653 --> 01:43:11,332
My sis will come with me
on every happy occasion.

1266
01:43:11,413 --> 01:43:14,532
Ok, l'll leave.
- How can you? Have tea first.

1267
01:43:14,613 --> 01:43:16,532
l've very little time. l've got
to go to many places to invite.

1268
01:43:16,613 --> 01:43:19,612
That's not possible, bro. l
won't Iet you go without having tea.

1269
01:43:19,933 --> 01:43:25,412
Ok, come. - Bro, bring
tea fast. Come, bro. Sit.

1270
01:43:33,893 --> 01:43:35,172
Come, Kailash.

1271
01:43:36,853 --> 01:43:37,972
Come, doctor.

1272
01:43:39,533 --> 01:43:41,172
Bro, he's doctor Kailash.

1273
01:43:45,933 --> 01:43:50,532
Congratulations, Mira. Wow!
What a lovely child! Give.

1274
01:43:52,493 --> 01:43:54,452
You've done a good
thing by supporting him.

1275
01:43:54,853 --> 01:43:57,692
Mother, looks like Dr.
Kailash and Mira know ..

1276
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:59,852
.. each other quite well.

1277
01:44:02,373 --> 01:44:03,572
Congratulations, daughter in law.

1278
01:44:03,653 --> 01:44:06,452
May God give us the chance
to truly congratulate you!

1279
01:44:06,533 --> 01:44:09,292
Yes, daughter in law, he
is a stranger after all.

1280
01:44:09,693 --> 01:44:11,932
Why stranger? He is also our own.

1281
01:44:13,613 --> 01:44:15,812
Don't feel like
letting him go, Mira.

1282
01:44:16,453 --> 01:44:20,092
But my patients must be
waiting for me. l'll have to go.

1283
01:44:20,813 --> 01:44:22,652
At least have some
sweets before you leave.

1284
01:44:23,053 --> 01:44:26,012
Yes, l'll have to
sweeten my mouth.

1285
01:44:42,573 --> 01:44:44,812
Be careful, Deepak. What's
this big thing you've brought?

1286
01:44:44,893 --> 01:44:48,332
For your child. - Yes, l know.
Hey, what are you doing?

1287
01:44:50,013 --> 01:44:53,612
Forgive me. - Where's your father?
- He's gone. - Where?

1288
01:44:53,693 --> 01:44:57,692
To home. Did you think
something else? He'll be here soon.

1289
01:44:57,773 --> 01:44:59,172
Here, take this in.
- Yes.

1290
01:45:01,893 --> 01:45:03,092
Where did this wall come from?

1291
01:45:04,973 --> 01:45:07,612
Rekha, congratulations
on your nephew's birthday.

1292
01:45:07,693 --> 01:45:10,532
And may we engage soon!
- Keep quiet. Come.

1293
01:45:10,613 --> 01:45:11,932
Congratulations, Bhabhi.

1294
01:45:14,213 --> 01:45:16,612
l searched the whole
market before getting this gift.

1295
01:45:16,693 --> 01:45:22,652
The child will play.. but he is
too young. Ok, you play with it.

1296
01:45:24,853 --> 01:45:28,012
Come, Radha.
- Congratulations on the birthday.

1297
01:45:29,053 --> 01:45:30,412
But what took you so long?

1298
01:45:30,493 --> 01:45:34,772
The thing is, bro, that
Rekha told me something. - What?

1299
01:45:34,853 --> 01:45:35,932
She said that it's
the child's birthday.

1300
01:45:36,013 --> 01:45:37,572
And there must be some
singing and dancing.

1301
01:45:37,653 --> 01:45:40,972
l liked the idea. So l
brought them along. Come, brothers.

1302
01:45:41,053 --> 01:45:42,212
You go in.

1303
01:45:44,333 --> 01:45:47,092
l didn't recognize them. - This is
Nazakat Ali. He is Sharafat Ali.

1304
01:45:47,413 --> 01:45:49,572
They're very mischievous.

1305
01:45:50,213 --> 01:45:53,692
Will you sing? - Yes, sir.
We'll sing praises for the child.

1306
01:45:54,373 --> 01:45:56,572
Not now!
- Come in.

1307
01:46:01,573 --> 01:46:05,412
Bring the child here.
Kids, come this way. Come here.

1308
01:46:14,453 --> 01:46:15,932
Blow the candles.

1309
01:46:19,573 --> 01:46:20,812
Clap!

1310
01:46:49,173 --> 01:46:53,492
Shut up! If you sing like this,
you'll embarrass me.

1311
01:46:53,853 --> 01:46:56,292
Looks like you had come from sheet.

1312
01:46:57,333 --> 01:47:00,652
What did you say your name is?
- Sharafat and Nazakat.

1313
01:47:00,733 --> 01:47:03,132
Forgive me, but your
parents have made a mistake.

1314
01:47:03,373 --> 01:47:05,492
Your voice neither has
sincerity nor delicacy.

1315
01:47:05,773 --> 01:47:10,572
Move back. l'll sing myself.
- Banne Khan, do you also sing?

1316
01:47:10,893 --> 01:47:14,092
Bro, you haven't yet
seen this side of me.

1317
01:47:14,493 --> 01:47:17,452
Have you heard the name of
Shakila Bano Bhopali? - Yes.

1318
01:47:17,733 --> 01:47:19,812
She's my disciple!
- Really?

1319
01:47:19,893 --> 01:47:21,892
l taught her to sing
since her childhood.

1320
01:47:22,173 --> 01:47:27,612
She moved ahead in life. So l
backed off. Come on. Back off!

1321
01:47:34,053 --> 01:47:35,572
Come, let's see
this side of yours.

1322
01:47:40,613 --> 01:47:45,892
l'll sing such a song, that
the party will keep clapping.

1323
01:47:47,813 --> 01:47:54,892
Or l'll change my name
Banne Khan Bhopali. - Wow!

1324
01:47:56,293 --> 01:48:02,612
Child, be so promising, ..

1325
01:48:03,133 --> 01:48:10,412
..that God showers
his blessings on you.

1326
01:48:13,008 --> 01:48:18,252
May your childhood be happy!

1327
01:48:18,933 --> 01:48:21,892
May your youth be evergreen!

1328
01:48:23,013 --> 01:48:30,892
May Allah bring this
day a thousand times!

1329
01:48:38,651 --> 01:48:52,492
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1330
01:48:53,440 --> 01:49:00,488
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1331
01:49:00,932 --> 01:49:12,132
lt is the duty of a human
to be of service to others.

1332
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:19,298
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1333
01:49:19,379 --> 01:49:26,476
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1334
01:49:26,557 --> 01:49:33,331
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1335
01:49:33,933 --> 01:49:40,892
Some said you are the king of stars.

1336
01:49:41,293 --> 01:49:47,652
Some said, come here to me.

1337
01:49:47,733 --> 01:49:51,532
Some prayed for you,
some blessed you..

1338
01:49:51,613 --> 01:49:55,252
..to be the apple of the eyes.

1339
01:49:55,333 --> 01:50:01,932
May your house shine in your light!

1340
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:13,152
lt is the duty of a human
to be of service to others.

1341
01:50:13,326 --> 01:50:20,081
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1342
01:50:20,536 --> 01:50:26,957
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1343
01:50:27,038 --> 01:50:33,173
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1344
01:50:47,253 --> 01:50:50,732
Study hard. Always move ahead.

1345
01:50:50,813 --> 01:50:54,092
Don't leave the truth, even if
you have to leave the world.

1346
01:50:54,373 --> 01:50:57,692
Do good things. And be
scared only of Allah.

1347
01:50:57,773 --> 01:51:01,212
Love everyone. And
do anything for love.

1348
01:51:02,973 --> 01:51:06,572
Love is that
treasure which never ends.

1349
01:51:06,653 --> 01:51:10,172
The one who has this
wealth has no grief.

1350
01:51:10,253 --> 01:51:14,177
The one who has this
wealth has no grief.

1351
01:51:14,453 --> 01:51:17,812
Explain those who
fight over things and..

1352
01:51:17,893 --> 01:51:24,612
..those who differentiate
between the white and the black.

1353
01:51:24,693 --> 01:51:31,612
Don't forget that everyone is equal.

1354
01:51:31,919 --> 01:51:42,426
lt is the duty of a human
to be of service to others.

Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

01:51:56,185 --> 01:52:02,855
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1358
01:52:26,813 --> 01:52:33,012
Your face already has that charisma ..

1359
01:52:33,933 --> 01:52:40,412
..that thousands of heart will
lie restless from where you pass.

1360
01:52:40,853 --> 01:52:47,012
When you'll bring
your bride in the Doli..

1361
01:52:47,693 --> 01:52:54,172
..l'll see that moment
only if l live till then.

1362
01:52:57,533 --> 01:53:01,092
lf Allah wishes l'll
come that day, too.

1363
01:53:01,173 --> 01:53:04,372
l've sung your birthday song.
l'll also sing for your wedding.

1364
01:53:04,453 --> 01:53:07,732
lf Allah wishes l'll
come that day, too.

1365
01:53:07,813 --> 01:53:11,202
l've sung your birthday song.
l'll also sing for your wedding.

1366
01:53:11,283 --> 01:53:14,856
l've sung your birthday song.
l'll also sing for your wedding.

1367
01:53:15,373 --> 01:53:18,692
The sun and the moon will come down.

1368
01:53:18,773 --> 01:53:25,212
To shower flowers on
the groom and the bride.

1369
01:53:25,293 --> 01:53:31,852
That happy day will come.

1370
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:42,197
lt is the duty of a human
to be of service to others.

1371
01:53:42,491 --> 01:53:49,085
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1372
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:55,756
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1373
01:53:55,837 --> 01:53:59,745
Only his life is
successful who knows this secret.

1374
01:54:02,813 --> 01:54:05,532
lt's so bad you left the party.

1375
01:54:06,613 --> 01:54:08,372
Do you expect me to
sit there to be insulted?

1376
01:54:08,453 --> 01:54:10,692
What happened?
- That what you wanted.

1377
01:54:10,973 --> 01:54:13,612
l had to welcome
everyone to hide your sin.

1378
01:54:13,693 --> 01:54:15,332
And had to accept congratulations..

1379
01:54:15,413 --> 01:54:16,812
..for the child of
don't know which scoundrel.

1380
01:54:17,693 --> 01:54:20,932
ls anything left to revenge now?
- No, it's not what you think.

1381
01:54:21,013 --> 01:54:23,132
Then what was the need to
celebrate the birthday of that child?

1382
01:54:23,213 --> 01:54:26,052
Father considers him his grandchild.
He gave the party.

1383
01:54:26,493 --> 01:54:30,092
What is my fault?
- It's not your fault. It's mine.

1384
01:54:30,413 --> 01:54:32,612
l couldn't be the
father of my wife's child.

1385
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:35,892
Go away from here. Go!

1386
01:54:40,333 --> 01:54:41,612
Sir's calling you.

1387
01:54:58,453 --> 01:55:02,092
You?
- Yes, me. Shyam won't come today.

1388
01:55:03,773 --> 01:55:06,012
The door's closed and
the office is sound proof.

1389
01:55:06,453 --> 01:55:09,372
Neither can you go out nor your voice.

1390
01:55:09,613 --> 01:55:13,532
Are you out of your senses?
- You've made me go crazy.

1391
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:20,172
l'll revenge for my insult today.
- Leave me you scoundrel!

1392
01:55:21,293 --> 01:55:26,492
l never let go of 2 things.
Money and woman!

1393
01:55:32,053 --> 01:55:36,332
You touched me with your lips
after all. But why only my writst?

1394
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:40,612
Stop! l said stop there.

1395
01:55:57,293 --> 01:56:01,612
Scoundrel! Shame less!

1396
01:56:12,653 --> 01:56:13,812
Mr. Raian!

1397
01:56:15,653 --> 01:56:18,692
Mr. Raian! Leave her.
You should be ashamed.

1398
01:56:21,053 --> 01:56:25,332
Come, child. Come out.
Don't be scared.

1399
01:56:39,373 --> 01:56:42,292
What are you thinking, Mr.
Mehta? Call up sir.

1400
01:56:44,013 --> 01:56:45,732
Wipe off your tears, child.

1401
01:56:46,373 --> 01:56:51,372
That rascal Raian has tried
to defame you. l'll kill him.

1402
01:56:51,453 --> 01:56:53,532
Come. Come with me.

1403
01:56:55,213 --> 01:56:59,012
Mr. Mehta, what's the problem?
Why did you call me?

1404
01:56:59,093 --> 01:57:01,372
A terrible thing has happened.
Mr. Rajan..

1405
01:57:01,573 --> 01:57:05,892
Raian what? - Mr. Raian.. -
Speak up! What did Rajan do?

1406
01:57:06,613 --> 01:57:07,852
Come here. l'll tell you.

1407
01:57:23,013 --> 01:57:26,052
So, mister, where are you going?

1408
01:57:27,173 --> 01:57:31,132
Take the prize for
your filthy behavior.

1409
01:57:48,773 --> 01:57:51,372
Listen, Banne Khan.
- What should l listen?

1410
01:57:52,293 --> 01:57:57,612
See for yourself. l had sent
my sis to work. Not to be raped.

1411
01:57:57,693 --> 01:58:01,692
l'll kill him.
- l feel sorry for what has happened.

1412
01:58:01,773 --> 01:58:05,972
l apologize on his behalf.
- Uncle, you are apologizing to him?

1413
01:58:06,253 --> 01:58:07,812
The one who insulted me
in front of every one?

1414
01:58:07,893 --> 01:58:12,012
This goon? - You are a goon.
And also a scoundrel.

1415
01:58:12,373 --> 01:58:17,052
Go away from here. Go.
- All right, l'll go.

1416
01:58:17,893 --> 01:58:19,932
But l'll remember
this insult, uncle.

1417
01:58:25,613 --> 01:58:30,012
Come in both of you. - No, bro.
We will go home now. Come, child.

1418
01:58:34,533 --> 01:58:39,532
May that Banne Khan be ruined!
How badly he has hit my child!

1419
01:58:41,053 --> 01:58:42,132
Enough, mother.

1420
01:58:42,373 --> 01:58:46,172
l say, why did brother in law
keep quiet when you got beaten?

1421
01:58:46,693 --> 01:58:47,892
He was watching the show, mother!

1422
01:58:48,093 --> 01:58:51,052
And when l asked him to
do justice he slapped me..

1423
01:58:51,133 --> 01:58:52,732
..in front of everyone,
and got me out of the office.

1424
01:58:52,813 --> 01:58:54,332
May his office burn down!

1425
01:58:54,413 --> 01:58:57,132
How could he behave this
way with his own nephew?

1426
01:58:57,533 --> 01:59:01,812
l will surely revenge for
your insult from brother in law.

1427
01:59:02,053 --> 01:59:05,852
Don't you worry, mother!
l'll take the revenge.

1428
01:59:06,093 --> 01:59:07,212
Such a revenge that..

1429
01:59:07,293 --> 01:59:10,012
..uncle and Shyam will not be
in a state to face the world.

1430
01:59:13,933 --> 01:59:16,212
So Raian told you
that the child Mira..

1431
01:59:16,293 --> 01:59:20,892
..has brought here is not her
friend's but her own? - Yes.

1432
01:59:21,933 --> 01:59:24,052
l know why Raian told such a thing.

1433
01:59:24,133 --> 01:59:26,972
Now l want to know that
how could you believe him?

1434
01:59:27,413 --> 01:59:28,492
lt is a matter of marriage..

1435
01:59:28,573 --> 01:59:30,492
Yes, l know it is a
matter of marriage.

1436
01:59:30,613 --> 01:59:32,812
And you should ask this question.

1437
01:59:33,093 --> 01:59:36,812
Now you can break this
relation if you want. - What?

1438
01:59:36,893 --> 01:59:39,332
Look, Mr. Devidayal, l
don't want my daughter..

1439
01:59:39,413 --> 01:59:43,332
..to be married in a family
where people believe in gossips.

1440
01:59:44,973 --> 01:59:48,612
Don't feel bad. After
all Rajan is your relative.

1441
01:59:48,853 --> 01:59:51,412
Whatever he told us,
we've told you.

1442
01:59:51,893 --> 01:59:56,772
Forgive us, Mr. Shukla.
- You know Mira well.

1443
01:59:57,213 --> 02:00:00,572
Only the lucky ones get such
a daughter in law nowadays.

1444
02:00:00,853 --> 02:00:02,692
lt was she who arranged the
marriage of Deepak and Rekha.

1445
02:00:02,773 --> 02:00:05,492
Yet if you are hesitant..
- What are you saying, Mr. Shukla?

1446
02:00:05,573 --> 02:00:07,652
We only have to fix the
date for engagement now.

1447
02:00:07,733 --> 02:00:11,332
Shall we leave now? Greetings.
- Greetings. - Come.

1448
02:00:19,173 --> 02:00:21,732
Stop! Please, stop for God's sake.

1449
02:00:21,813 --> 02:00:23,092
This child cannot
live in this house now.

1450
02:00:25,773 --> 02:00:27,892
What happened to the child,
Shyam? Where are you taking him?

1451
02:00:30,093 --> 02:00:33,732
Why don't you answer? - l'm
going to admit him to an orphanage.

1452
02:00:34,253 --> 02:00:35,692
Orphanage? Why?

1453
02:00:35,773 --> 02:00:37,772
Rekha's engagement was going
to end today because of him.

1454
02:00:38,133 --> 02:00:39,692
That's why you're
taking him to an orphanage?

1455
02:00:39,933 --> 02:00:42,452
lf people are stupid,
it's not this child's fault.

1456
02:00:42,533 --> 02:00:44,532
People bring up the kids
of even cats and dogs.

1457
02:00:44,613 --> 02:00:46,572
This is the child of a human.
Daughter in law, take him in.

1458
02:00:47,893 --> 02:00:50,372
Father, we haven't started
an orphanage in this house.

1459
02:00:51,373 --> 02:00:53,772
When l adopted you, this
house wasn't an orphanage.

1460
02:00:53,853 --> 02:00:55,692
At least you
shouldn't talk such things..

1461
02:01:00,893 --> 02:01:04,492
Thank you, father. l had
forgotten that l am an orphan.

1462
02:01:05,573 --> 02:01:07,092
Good that you reminded me.

1463
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:15,532
What happened to Shyam?

1464
02:01:15,813 --> 02:01:17,492
Why does he mind
this child living here?

1465
02:01:18,893 --> 02:01:20,052
Take him up.

1466
02:01:26,093 --> 02:01:28,012
Can l come in, brother?

1467
02:01:29,293 --> 02:01:32,852
Come in, Banne Khan?
Why did you stop there?

1468
02:01:35,613 --> 02:01:40,172
l hit Raian in your office.
l am embarrassed for that.

1469
02:01:40,773 --> 02:01:42,172
l've come to apologize.

1470
02:01:42,733 --> 02:01:44,332
But what could l do, bro?"

1471
02:01:44,413 --> 02:01:45,732
It was a question of
my sister's dignity.

1472
02:01:45,813 --> 02:01:46,972
l couldn't control myself.

1473
02:01:47,053 --> 02:01:51,292
l understand, Banne Khan. l, too,
said such a thing today.

1474
02:01:51,853 --> 02:01:54,732
l couldn't control myself either.
- What happened, brother?

1475
02:01:55,373 --> 02:01:58,492
l said something to Shyam
which l shouldn't have said.

1476
02:01:58,893 --> 02:02:00,172
He's upset now and gone out.

1477
02:02:00,253 --> 02:02:03,372
You're tensed for such a small matter?

1478
02:02:03,573 --> 02:02:04,972
l'll go and call him right now.

1479
02:02:05,253 --> 02:02:07,932
You.. - But first tell me
that you've forgiven me.

1480
02:02:08,173 --> 02:02:10,012
There's nothing to forgive for.

1481
02:02:10,093 --> 02:02:11,732
Can a friend like you make a mistake?

1482
02:02:11,813 --> 02:02:16,812
You've made your friend
your slave by saying this.

1483
02:02:17,133 --> 02:02:20,052
Not a slave, Banne Khan.
You're my friend.

1484
02:02:20,133 --> 02:02:22,332
Leave me, bro. l'll go
and bring him right now.

1485
02:03:07,813 --> 02:03:11,972
l want to say something.
l can't see anyone sad.

1486
02:03:12,213 --> 02:03:15,732
l quench the thirst
of eyes with my eyes.

1487
02:03:21,893 --> 02:03:26,092
l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication.

1488
02:03:27,173 --> 02:03:31,092
l'm the cure to all
the grief of the world.

1489
02:03:31,602 --> 02:03:35,439
l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication.

1490
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:41,212
l'm the cure to all
the grief of the world.

1491
02:03:41,293 --> 02:03:45,245
l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication.

1492
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:49,731
l'm the cure to all
the grief of the world.

1493
02:04:27,173 --> 02:04:31,732
Dear, look at me.
Don't be shy in this party.

1494
02:04:31,813 --> 02:04:40,292
l know what's in your heart.
Enjoy the drink and the life.

1495
02:04:41,007 --> 02:04:45,568
Dear, look at me.
Don't be shy in this party.

1496
02:04:45,649 --> 02:04:54,281
l know what's in your heart.
Enjoy the drink and the life.

1497
02:04:54,362 --> 02:05:03,103
Those who are depressed
have no one of their own.

1498
02:05:03,375 --> 02:05:06,772
l make them mine.

1499
02:05:08,499 --> 02:05:13,190
l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication.

1500
02:05:13,375 --> 02:05:17,493
l'm the cure to all
the grief of the world.

1501
02:05:17,574 --> 02:05:21,969
l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication.

1502
02:05:22,543 --> 02:05:26,293
l'm the cure to all
the grief of the world.

1503
02:05:52,093 --> 02:05:56,812
Your face is sad.
There's sorrow in your eyes.

1504
02:05:56,893 --> 02:06:00,692
What's happened to you? Smile a bit.

1505
02:06:00,773 --> 02:06:05,332
Forget what has happened.

1506
02:06:06,025 --> 02:06:10,457
Your face is sad.
There's sorrow in your eyes.

1507
02:06:10,538 --> 02:06:18,879
What's happened to you? Smile a bit.

1508
02:06:19,653 --> 02:06:28,052
Whether it's the thirst of sad
eyes, or some fire in the heart.

1509
02:06:28,133 --> 02:06:31,932
l quench both.

1510
02:06:33,201 --> 02:06:37,448
l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication.

1511
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:42,259
l'm the cure to all
the grief of the world.

1512
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:46,864
l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication.

1513
02:06:46,945 --> 02:06:51,167
I'm the cure to all
the grief of the world.

1514
02:07:40,053 --> 02:07:42,692
l don't have cash. Take this necklace.

1515
02:07:47,093 --> 02:07:52,452
Take off your hand! How much
is the bill? Here, take this.

1516
02:07:52,533 --> 02:07:54,852
Uncle Banne! Greetings.

1517
02:07:55,133 --> 02:07:59,972
My dear, you were trading
daughter in law's necklace for liquor.

1518
02:08:00,573 --> 02:08:08,012
Daughter in law? Whose? That of
father? He takes her to be a goddess.

1519
02:08:08,293 --> 02:08:10,972
And because of whom l had
to leave the house today.

1520
02:08:11,493 --> 02:08:15,572
Only l know the real face of
that goddess, uncle Banne.

1521
02:08:15,813 --> 02:08:18,692
That child is not of
her friend. But her own!

1522
02:08:19,093 --> 02:08:22,132
Shame on you! You're
out of your senses.

1523
02:08:22,493 --> 02:08:24,732
lf you drink filthy things,
you'll have only filthy thoughts.

1524
02:08:25,253 --> 02:08:28,212
Uncle Banne, l'm a
human being. Not a saint.

1525
02:08:28,293 --> 02:08:31,252
l cannot accept
someone else's child as mine.

1526
02:08:31,333 --> 02:08:34,292
Look, son, the liquor has
totally disillusioned you.

1527
02:08:34,533 --> 02:08:37,932
Now come with me or l'll slap you.

1528
02:08:38,013 --> 02:08:41,212
And you'll come back to
your senses. Come on now.

1529
02:08:56,373 --> 02:08:59,252
Father, are you all right?

1530
02:08:59,733 --> 02:09:01,092
l'm fine, child. What is it?

1531
02:09:01,373 --> 02:09:04,532
Father, l've sent the invitation
of Rekha's engagement to all.

1532
02:09:04,733 --> 02:09:07,972
Good. Have you sent at
Bhabhi's place, too? - Yes.

1533
02:09:10,053 --> 02:09:12,732
l didn't want Raian to
step in this house again.

1534
02:09:13,293 --> 02:09:15,892
l still feel embarrassed
in front of Banne Khan..

1535
02:09:15,973 --> 02:09:17,932
..for what Raian did
in the office that day.

1536
02:09:18,213 --> 02:09:21,012
Do you know what Raian told
about you to Deepak's parents?

1537
02:09:22,333 --> 02:09:26,532
l can't tell you what he said.
- Whatever it might be, father.

1538
02:09:26,613 --> 02:09:28,332
This is the occasion
of Rekha's engagement.

1539
02:09:28,933 --> 02:09:32,012
What will people say if we
don't invite our close relatives?

1540
02:09:33,013 --> 02:09:38,132
Please forget whatever
Raian has done. Forgive him.

1541
02:09:40,613 --> 02:09:42,372
You really are a goddess,
daughter in law.

1542
02:09:42,853 --> 02:09:44,252
You've done the right thing.

1543
02:10:16,333 --> 02:10:19,172
Come, uncle Banne. How are you?
- How are you, son?

1544
02:10:19,253 --> 02:10:21,412
Greetings, brother.
- Come, dear.

1545
02:10:21,733 --> 02:10:24,292
Congratulations for Rekha's
engagement. - Same to you.

1546
02:10:24,373 --> 02:10:25,892
Why didn't you bring Radha along?

1547
02:10:25,973 --> 02:10:27,372
l had gone out on some work.

1548
02:10:27,453 --> 02:10:29,572
l had told her to come by herself.
She must be coming.

1549
02:10:29,893 --> 02:10:30,972
Come l'll introduce
you to Deepak's parents.

1550
02:10:31,053 --> 02:10:32,772
Yes, let me meet them. Come.

1551
02:10:39,933 --> 02:10:42,412
Come in, Raian. Why
are you standing out?

1552
02:10:43,253 --> 02:10:46,452
l've iust brought a gift.
- Rekha is in. Come in and give her.

1553
02:10:46,533 --> 02:10:49,612
Not for Rekha, it's for you.
- For me?

1554
02:10:50,533 --> 02:10:53,092
You'll be pleased to see
the gift. Come with me.

1555
02:10:57,413 --> 02:11:02,012
This is my gift. - Whose
letter is it? - Read it for youself.

1556
02:11:04,893 --> 02:11:07,412
Raian, this is my
Iast letter to you.

1557
02:11:08,133 --> 02:11:09,732
Since the day l told you
that l'm going to be..

1558
02:11:09,813 --> 02:11:12,812
..your child's mother,
you've turned away from me.

1559
02:11:13,733 --> 02:11:15,852
Only then could l
understand your real self.

1560
02:11:16,213 --> 02:11:18,332
l wish l had realized
your deceit that day..

1561
02:11:18,773 --> 02:11:21,692
..when you secretly
married me in a temple..

1562
02:11:22,013 --> 02:11:23,932
..so that there would be
no proof of our marriage.

1563
02:11:24,653 --> 02:11:27,332
Well, leaving behind my
mistake and your deceit..

1564
02:11:27,413 --> 02:11:29,172
..l'm starting a new life by being..

1565
02:11:29,493 --> 02:11:31,732
..the daughter in
law of a rich family.

1566
02:11:32,733 --> 02:11:38,652
l have nothing to do with you now.
Don't try to look for me. Mira.

1567
02:11:40,973 --> 02:11:44,972
lt is your wife's letter.
Don't you recognize her writing?

1568
02:11:46,533 --> 02:11:48,612
The destiny sometimes
plays dangerous jokes.

1569
02:11:49,133 --> 02:11:51,292
When you got married,
l was shocked.

1570
02:11:52,053 --> 02:11:56,412
But l kept quiet because it was a
question of our family's dignity.

1571
02:11:57,253 --> 02:12:00,372
But today l want to
revenge for my insult."

1572
02:12:00,773 --> 02:12:01,892
"What will you do, Rajan?

1573
02:12:02,973 --> 02:12:05,012
Haven't decided yet..

1574
02:12:06,093 --> 02:12:09,932
..whether to go to court or get
this printed in the newspapers.

1575
02:12:12,053 --> 02:12:14,132
Everyone's present in today's party.

1576
02:12:15,293 --> 02:12:20,732
Your wife, my child,
uncle, Rekha and her in laws.

1577
02:12:21,133 --> 02:12:23,212
Why not inform them all together?

1578
02:12:25,373 --> 02:12:26,452
Come with me.

1579
02:12:26,533 --> 02:12:27,732
Raian, what a terrible
thing you are doing!

1580
02:12:27,813 --> 02:12:29,772
Today's Rekha's engagement.
The guests have come. And..

1581
02:12:29,853 --> 02:12:32,132
And it is a nice chance
for me to take revenge.

1582
02:12:33,013 --> 02:12:35,852
Rekha's life will be ruined.
After all, she's your sis, too.

1583
02:12:35,933 --> 02:12:38,172
This relation ended
that same day when uncle..

1584
02:12:38,253 --> 02:12:41,892
..insulted me in front of
everyone by slapping me.

1585
02:12:41,973 --> 02:12:45,332
And you kept watching quietly?
- Forgive me, Rajan.

1586
02:12:45,573 --> 02:12:47,852
Let Rekha's engagement finish.
Then we'll do what you want.

1587
02:12:48,213 --> 02:12:49,652
lt is a question of
our family's prestige.

1588
02:12:49,813 --> 02:12:51,932
My dignity is more
precious than that of the family.

1589
02:12:52,013 --> 02:12:53,932
Raian, l am ready to
pay any price for that.

1590
02:12:55,373 --> 02:12:56,732
Then sign on this cheque.

1591
02:13:00,693 --> 02:13:02,692
l'll fill up the
amount of my dignity myself.

1592
02:13:12,453 --> 02:13:14,812
Deepak, you're
getting engaged now.

1593
02:13:15,013 --> 02:13:17,452
l don't want to see
you in the parks then.

1594
02:13:18,813 --> 02:13:19,972
Brother!

1595
02:13:20,653 --> 02:13:23,412
Forgive me, barrister, but l
want to say something to you.

1596
02:13:24,213 --> 02:13:27,492
ls there some problem?
- l want to talk to you privately.

1597
02:13:28,093 --> 02:13:29,332
Why? You can say that here.

1598
02:13:31,533 --> 02:13:32,612
What happened?

1599
02:13:38,733 --> 02:13:40,212
lt is a warrant to arrest Mira!

1600
02:13:45,053 --> 02:13:47,932
She has already married before?
- Yes, to your nephew Rajan!

1601
02:13:48,733 --> 02:13:50,732
Raian had married Mira secretly?

1602
02:13:51,453 --> 02:13:53,892
They also have a child, which
she calls that of her friend.

1603
02:13:53,973 --> 02:13:56,932
This is false. Totally wrong.

1604
02:13:57,013 --> 02:14:01,412
l see everything, bro. Raian has
played this trick to defame you.

1605
02:14:01,493 --> 02:14:04,052
That might be possible.
But l'm bound by my duty.

1606
02:14:04,333 --> 02:14:05,932
She will have to
come with me right now.

1607
02:14:06,013 --> 02:14:09,532
l understand. But how can you
take her now? You see we have..

1608
02:14:09,893 --> 02:14:11,092
Let her go, father.

1609
02:14:12,693 --> 02:14:14,772
Whatever the
inspector has said is true.

1610
02:14:15,573 --> 02:14:18,132
She had a relation with
Raian and it is her child.

1611
02:14:18,373 --> 02:14:21,452
How can you say that?
- Read this, father.

1612
02:14:22,013 --> 02:14:24,732
You'll know all the evil
deeds of your daughter in law.

1613
02:14:25,013 --> 02:14:29,252
And you'll also know why she
requested you to forgive Rajan.

1614
02:14:29,693 --> 02:14:34,812
You keep quiet. Daughter in law,
have you written this letter?

1615
02:14:36,373 --> 02:14:37,892
Since the day l told you
that l'm going to be..

1616
02:14:39,253 --> 02:14:44,292
l'm starting a new life by being
the daughter in law of a rich family

1617
02:14:45,253 --> 02:14:49,332
Father, this is my handwriting.
But this letter is false.

1618
02:14:49,413 --> 02:14:53,932
Whatever is written in here
is wrong. Believe me, father.

1619
02:14:54,013 --> 02:14:56,932
l have no relation with Raian.
- Then whose child is this?

1620
02:14:57,133 --> 02:14:59,732
You had told me yourself that
it is your child, hadn't you?

1621
02:14:59,813 --> 02:15:01,932
Yes, l had said
that it is my child.

1622
02:15:02,013 --> 02:15:04,252
But l have no relation with Rajan.

1623
02:15:06,173 --> 02:15:09,452
What is this that l hear,
daughter in law?

1624
02:15:09,613 --> 02:15:11,212
Banne Khan, do you hear that?

1625
02:15:11,853 --> 02:15:15,372
lnspector, take her. And take
along this bundle of sin also.

1626
02:15:16,813 --> 02:15:17,972
Take her, inspector.

1627
02:15:39,453 --> 02:15:43,652
Don't worry, Mira. l'll soon
bring the lawyer for your bail.

1628
02:15:45,093 --> 02:15:50,292
You still want to get me a
bail after l am accused so badly?

1629
02:15:51,453 --> 02:15:55,052
The moon doesn't become dirty
even if we throw mud at it, Mira.

1630
02:16:02,573 --> 02:16:03,732
This is the matter.

1631
02:16:05,133 --> 02:16:07,292
Brother's dignity is ruined
because of daughter in law.

1632
02:16:07,693 --> 02:16:08,852
This is false!

1633
02:16:09,573 --> 02:16:10,972
All this is false.

1634
02:16:11,453 --> 02:16:15,332
Father, all this is wrong.
- What is wrong, child?

1635
02:16:15,413 --> 02:16:17,612
Mira is not the mother
of this child. It is me!

1636
02:16:18,053 --> 02:16:19,572
l am the mother of this child.

1637
02:16:19,813 --> 02:16:22,092
And it is not Raian who
is his father. It is him!

1638
02:16:25,173 --> 02:16:29,892
l thought my son had got
his rights in this house.

1639
02:16:30,333 --> 02:16:32,892
You made him your
grandchild by adopting him.

1640
02:16:33,373 --> 02:16:37,732
But l didn't know he
would hate his own child.

1641
02:16:38,093 --> 02:16:39,972
That he would hate his own blood.

1642
02:16:40,053 --> 02:16:42,052
That he would hate a
goddess like Mira who accepted..

1643
02:16:42,133 --> 02:16:46,812
..his child by listening to my
request and covered his mistake.

1644
02:16:49,373 --> 02:16:51,892
Now you tell me Shyam whether
what she said is true or false.

1645
02:16:53,013 --> 02:16:58,652
Answer me, Shyam! - It is true
that l wanted to marry Radha..

1646
02:17:00,093 --> 02:17:04,212
And that child is also yours.
Believe me, father, it is his child.

1647
02:17:04,493 --> 02:17:07,452
l believe you. But why didn't
you tell me all this before?

1648
02:17:07,852 --> 02:17:10,451
Banne Khan, are you listening this?
- Yes, l am, brother.

1649
02:17:10,532 --> 02:17:14,171
l doubted my
daughter in law! l doubted..

1650
02:17:15,653 --> 02:17:17,092
Brother!
- Father!

1651
02:17:24,093 --> 02:17:28,892
Bro, God forbid, if
something happens to you..

1652
02:17:30,253 --> 02:17:32,732
..l'll kill Rajan.

1653
02:17:35,813 --> 02:17:37,372
My trick has worked.

1654
02:17:38,173 --> 02:17:42,532
l've revenged for my insult
from both uncle and Shyam.

1655
02:17:43,133 --> 02:17:45,852
You haven't revenged.
You've proved how low you are.

1656
02:17:45,933 --> 02:17:47,372
Mother!
- Your mother's dead.

1657
02:17:47,452 --> 02:17:48,571
And it would have been better..

1658
02:17:48,653 --> 02:17:49,772
..if you had died as
soon as you were born.

1659
02:17:49,852 --> 02:17:51,651
Worthless! Wretched!

1660
02:17:51,973 --> 02:17:55,012
You played with the dignity of
the family for a trifle revenge?

1661
02:17:55,413 --> 02:17:59,532
Do you know, that the
child's real father is Shyam?

1662
02:17:59,893 --> 02:18:01,852
And his mother is
not Mira, but Radha.

1663
02:18:02,133 --> 02:18:04,052
Radha is the mother of that child?
- Yes, Radha.

1664
02:18:04,333 --> 02:18:06,412
You've accused Mira so amully..

1665
02:18:06,493 --> 02:18:08,332
..that brother in law
will never forgive you.

1666
02:18:08,813 --> 02:18:11,372
Mira's statement
tomorrow will get you in jail.

1667
02:18:11,612 --> 02:18:13,731
Mira will not reach the court.

1668
02:18:14,813 --> 02:18:17,412
Come on. - Raian, what
are you going to do now?

1669
02:18:17,493 --> 02:18:20,332
l won't let you go.
- Let me go, mother.

1670
02:18:20,413 --> 02:18:22,572
l said, l won't let you go.
- Leave me, mother.

1671
02:18:30,692 --> 02:18:31,811
Thank you, lawyer.

1672
02:18:32,973 --> 02:18:34,092
Come, Mira.

1673
02:18:50,053 --> 02:18:52,652
Come, child. Get a bail
for daughter in law now.

1674
02:18:52,933 --> 02:18:55,572
And take her back
home with respect. Come.

1675
02:18:59,933 --> 02:19:03,532
Mira!
- Yes. - Whose child is this?

1676
02:19:04,772 --> 02:19:07,971
lt is my child.
Everyone has believed that.

1677
02:19:08,053 --> 02:19:09,212
But l don't believe it.

1678
02:19:10,013 --> 02:19:12,132
It is a sin to think
such a bad thing about you.

1679
02:19:13,013 --> 02:19:16,932
Whose sin are you trying to
hide by accepting this child?

1680
02:19:18,692 --> 02:19:21,891
Raian's disgusting accusations
have taken this matter to the court.

1681
02:19:22,772 --> 02:19:27,011
lf you still keep quiet, Shyam
and his father will be blemished.

1682
02:19:28,013 --> 02:19:31,932
And your mother? She has
recovered after a long ailment.

1683
02:19:32,852 --> 02:19:34,171
Do you want to lose her?

1684
02:19:34,852 --> 02:19:38,051
No, don't say such thing, doctor.

1685
02:19:38,653 --> 02:19:41,052
Sometimes even the
duty becomes helplessness.

1686
02:19:41,772 --> 02:19:47,091
Only God and l know
what was my helplessness.

1687
02:19:47,733 --> 02:19:49,732
l fulfilled my duty at
the risk of falling..

1688
02:19:49,813 --> 02:19:51,892
..from the eyes of my husband.

1689
02:19:53,013 --> 02:19:55,572
But Raian has forced me..

1690
02:19:55,653 --> 02:20:00,612
..to tell the secret of this
child by accusing my purity.

1691
02:20:00,693 --> 02:20:08,252
Shyam is the father of this child.
l don't know who his mother is.

1692
02:20:18,853 --> 02:20:20,012
Come, Mira.

1693
02:20:38,613 --> 02:20:41,452
What happened, mister?
- That.. that..

1694
02:20:43,133 --> 02:20:45,612
You take care of the child.
l'll deal with them.

1695
02:20:51,093 --> 02:20:53,772
Kill Mira before she
regains consciousness.

1696
02:20:54,013 --> 02:20:55,092
Not a bad idea.

1697
02:20:55,173 --> 02:20:57,932
The doctor will be accused
and you'll get out scot-free.

1698
02:24:39,733 --> 02:24:41,532
Sister Mira! Sister Mira!

1699
02:24:50,373 --> 02:24:51,532
Leave me!

1700
02:25:02,333 --> 02:25:05,332
Brother! Shyam!

1701
02:25:13,493 --> 02:25:20,452
Radha! Back off,
Radha. Move aside, Radha.

1702
02:25:20,693 --> 02:25:22,172
There's a ditch behind.

1703
02:25:24,653 --> 02:25:27,412
Radha, move aside!

1704
02:26:45,493 --> 02:26:46,572
Get hold of him.

1705
02:26:58,213 --> 02:26:59,332
Radha?

1706
02:27:04,453 --> 02:27:07,892
Shyam, move the car behind.

1707
02:27:22,893 --> 02:27:27,452
Silly, you didn't care
for your life to save mine.

1708
02:27:28,373 --> 02:27:29,492
What if something had happened to you?

1709
02:27:31,333 --> 02:27:33,292
lf l could sacrifice my life..

1710
02:27:34,773 --> 02:27:36,492
..for a goddess like you,
all my troubles would end.

1711
02:27:37,493 --> 02:27:40,012
lf you had written your
name in that letter, Radha..

1712
02:27:40,453 --> 02:27:42,372
..you wouldn't have had to
go through all these troubles.

1713
02:27:42,973 --> 02:27:47,132
And neither would l have had
to show that l am Shyam's wife.

1714
02:27:49,013 --> 02:27:50,932
Why did you do this, sister Mira?

1715
02:27:53,693 --> 02:27:56,892
l had only requested you
give the child his rights.

1716
02:27:57,293 --> 02:27:59,972
l could have done
that anytime, Radha.

1717
02:28:00,613 --> 02:28:02,572
But how would you get iustice then?

1718
02:28:03,693 --> 02:28:08,092
God knows that l never
considered Shyam my husband.

1719
02:28:08,693 --> 02:28:13,212
l lied that the child is mine,
only to save your husband.

1720
02:28:14,173 --> 02:28:18,932
l was sure that the memory of the
child will keep his mother alive.

1721
02:28:19,333 --> 02:28:21,612
And one day she'll surely come to me.

1722
02:28:22,133 --> 02:28:23,812
That day has come, Radha..

1723
02:28:24,053 --> 02:28:28,972
..when l should return your
child and your husband to you.

1724
02:28:29,053 --> 02:28:33,132
Mira, what are you saying?
- l am telling the truth, father.

1725
02:28:33,613 --> 02:28:35,252
Before bringing the
child to this house..

1726
02:28:35,333 --> 02:28:38,092
..l had vowed in front of God that..

1727
02:28:38,413 --> 02:28:40,972
..along with the child
l'll get his mother her right.

1728
02:28:41,053 --> 02:28:44,652
Why didn't you think before
vowing that you were married to Shyam?

1729
02:28:44,733 --> 02:28:46,412
But before my marriage..

1730
02:28:46,493 --> 02:28:48,452
..Shyam and Radha
had already become one.

1731
02:28:48,533 --> 02:28:51,052
We can respect your
feelings for Radha.

1732
02:28:51,133 --> 02:28:53,532
But we cannot allow you..

1733
02:28:53,613 --> 02:28:55,572
..to take any step against
the society or the religion.

1734
02:28:55,653 --> 02:28:57,692
The religion teaches
us humanity, father.

1735
02:28:58,213 --> 02:29:00,212
lt does not allow us to
snatch away someone's rights.

1736
02:29:00,533 --> 02:29:02,812
Shyam is the child's father.
And Radha is the mother.

1737
02:29:02,893 --> 02:29:04,572
lt is impossible for me..

1738
02:29:04,653 --> 02:29:06,772
..to interfere between
them after knowing this.

1739
02:29:07,773 --> 02:29:13,252
Father, tell me, who has the
right to be his wife? Me or Radha?

1740
02:29:15,773 --> 02:29:16,972
Answer to that, Shyam.

1741
02:29:17,333 --> 02:29:20,412
Why did you marry Mira
when you had accepted Radha?

1742
02:29:22,613 --> 02:29:25,732
Father, l had
accepted Radha as my wife..

1743
02:29:25,813 --> 02:29:29,772
..in front of God thinking
her to be Mr. Shrma's daughter.

1744
02:29:30,173 --> 02:29:32,132
And thinking that
l'm going to marry her.

1745
02:29:32,933 --> 02:29:35,052
l had no bad intentions
when l accepted Radha.

1746
02:29:35,133 --> 02:29:36,852
Nor did l want to cheat her.

1747
02:29:37,093 --> 02:29:38,732
But it was my bad luck..

1748
02:29:39,093 --> 02:29:42,772
..that l misunderstood
Radha and married Mira.

1749
02:29:43,213 --> 02:29:45,412
Do you know what a big
mistake you've done?

1750
02:29:45,733 --> 02:29:46,972
But what is your decision now?

1751
02:29:48,373 --> 02:29:51,852
lf Mira can forgive me, l
am ready to accept Radha.

1752
02:29:51,933 --> 02:29:55,292
Never! We have no relationship now.

1753
02:29:55,373 --> 02:29:56,532
And there can't be one either.

1754
02:29:58,093 --> 02:29:59,972
Father, if l'm ready
to Iet go of my right..

1755
02:30:00,053 --> 02:30:02,052
..if Shyam is ready to accept Radha..

1756
02:30:02,133 --> 02:30:05,772
Shameless! Do you
realize what you're saying?

1757
02:30:07,693 --> 02:30:11,772
You would understand
what l am saying, mother..

1758
02:30:12,133 --> 02:30:14,372
..if Radha was your
daughter instead of me.

1759
02:30:15,373 --> 02:30:18,532
Just think, mother. You're
a wife and also a mother.

1760
02:30:18,933 --> 02:30:21,772
Would you want your child..

1761
02:30:21,853 --> 02:30:23,732
..and your husband to
be seized away from you?

1762
02:30:23,813 --> 02:30:25,012
Stop talking rubbish, Mira.

1763
02:30:25,533 --> 02:30:29,812
Believe me, father. If
you refuse my request..

1764
02:30:30,013 --> 02:30:32,012
..which even God has accepted..

1765
02:30:32,933 --> 02:30:35,572
..l'll break all the rules of
the society by killing myself.

1766
02:30:36,133 --> 02:30:39,452
But l'll never remain happy by
shattering the dreams of Radha.

1767
02:30:40,493 --> 02:30:43,292
This is my decision.
And this is my vow.

1768
02:30:43,373 --> 02:30:47,332
Shivcharan, you should be
proud of such a daughter.

1769
02:30:47,893 --> 02:30:50,932
The world has many stories of a
woman's sacrifice and greatness.

1770
02:30:51,013 --> 02:30:53,012
But no one has ever heard
of a woman sacrificing..

1771
02:30:53,093 --> 02:30:57,092
..her nuptials to give
another woman her right.

1772
02:30:57,453 --> 02:30:59,732
Your daughter has
reached the greatness..

1773
02:30:59,813 --> 02:31:02,212
..of a woman to that
peak which is matchless.

1774
02:31:02,693 --> 02:31:06,652
Shivcharan, l've agreed to
her decision. You agree, too.

1775
02:31:06,933 --> 02:31:09,172
One should get what is his right.

1776
02:31:09,853 --> 02:31:11,452
You are right, Shukla.

1777
02:31:13,133 --> 02:31:18,332
Child, we've agreed to
your decision. - Father!

1778
02:31:20,253 --> 02:31:22,572
Child, you came to this
house as a daughter in law.

1779
02:31:23,813 --> 02:31:25,772
Today you're standing in
