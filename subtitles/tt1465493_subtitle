1
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,719
Where are the new Cosmo prints?

2
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,352
Don't look at me
like that, we're late.

3
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,793
I've been waiting. - Don't argue
with me, don't talk to me.

4
00:01:57,864 --> 00:01:59,764
I'm not even here.
- Oh, God, I wish.

5
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,731
What do you guys think, it's funny?
What do you want me to do?

6
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:03,861
Roll my hair back and laugh
out your termination letter.

7
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,199
How's that for a joke?

8
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:08,672
And you... you are Mr. Kocher, sir.

9
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:09,868
You've worn such a nice suit.

10
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:11,869
Shall I get something for you?
- Get me the photographer.

11
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:13,674
Oh, him. He arrived long time ago.

12
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:15,476
He's waiting in the lobby. Coming
up right way, sir. - Who, Arman?

13
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,244
I'm just coming from the lobby,
he wasn't there.

14
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,647
Yes, he's isn't in the lobby...

15
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:20,481
...he's slightly away
from it, on the road.

16
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:21,612
He's stuck on the road.

17
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:22,746
Because there's a traffic jam.

18
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:25,223
But the roads are clear.
- Right, the roads are clear.

19
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:26,884
The roads are...
how can I forget, sir?

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,622
He ordered special lenses
from Paris for your shoot.

21
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:30,754
Special lenses.

22
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,594
Those lenses were delivered late...
- Lenses? What lenses?

23
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,360
Do I need to tell
you everything, fool?

24
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:36,234
Sir, five minutes.

25
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:37,360
He'll be here in five minutes.

26
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:38,836
With the lenses. Five minutes.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,901
Five minutes.
- Are you going to time it?

28
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,411
Can I have ten minutes?
- No.

29
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,880
Sir, he's one of the best.
- He's the best.

30
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:06,363
Slept well.
- Yeah, slept well.

31
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:08,325
Hi.

32
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,271
Good morning, Arman.
- Morning.

33
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:22,005
God!

34
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,474
God!

35
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,012
No. You don't want to be
in my shoes.

36
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:30,881
Trust me on that.

37
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:51,842
We're different from
the people of this world.

38
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:55,473
We're shocking.

39
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:01,749
Now, I know how madmen live.

40
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:07,993
We've forsaken the
world and accepted solitude.

41
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:09,919
You know what I need, Ghostbusters.

42
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:11,361
You me and ghost.

43
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,931
You me and ghost.

44
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,698
You me and ghost.

45
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,569
You me and ghost.

46
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:26,904
So, that's my story.

47
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,480
Scary, huh.
- Hi.

48
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,714
Late.
- Thanks.

49
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:32,843
As usual.

50
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,011
At least I'm consistent.

51
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,985
Give more importance to
your work than drinking.

52
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,352
Get my camera, please.

53
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,823
You drink at nights
and I get the hangover.

54
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,418
What... what is my job?

55
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,359
Make bizarre excuses...

56
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,022
...and listen to unlimited abuses.

57
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,395
Hi, Arman.
- Thanks, Becky.

58
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:47,625
What... what excuse did you give?

59
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:48,759
The same old one.

60
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:51,400
You had ordered for
special lenses from Paris.

61
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,368
They haven't arrived.
They were delivered late.

62
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,634
That's what delayed you...
blah, blah, blah...

63
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,369
Good one. That's a good one.

64
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:57,740
That's what was going
on in my mind as well.

65
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,411
We think so similarly, don't we?

66
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:01,571
I don't know about that.

67
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:03,548
But I'm surely going to kick you.

68
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,378
Oh Jesus, darn it.

69
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:07,511
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

70
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:08,815
I drink this every morning.

71
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:10,749
Some day, it's all
going to come out.

72
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:13,384
We have to bear the stink.

73
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,518
Your mouth stinks.

74
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:15,922
You stink.
- Can't help it.

75
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,054
Shut up
- I was lying around all night.

76
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,030
Do you booze or bathe in it?

77
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,457
It's my helplessness.

78
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,000
And please, use men's perfume.

79
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,729
What is this ladies' perfume?

80
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:24,929
Gehna will suspect me.

81
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:26,063
Loser.

82
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,936
I quit.
- Promise.

83
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:39,142
Thanks.

84
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:03,967
Okay, I think we got it.

85
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:05,102
It's a wrap.

86
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,440
Go home get drunk...

87
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:07,878
...and enjoy yourself,
thank you, ladies.

88
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,192
You have no messages.

89
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:47,083
I'm going to show myself to him.

90
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,155
Are you mad? Did you forget that
the last one had a heart attack?

91
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,746
I've found him
with great difficulty.

92
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:18,178
If anything happens to him,
then I'll... - Kill you.

93
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,513
Go ahead.

94
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:46,603
Excuse me.

95
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:52,709
Be quiet

96
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:54,083
Didn't I say that
I'll explain it to him?

97
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:13,699
Hi, hello there.
- Hey.

98
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:15,870
What's wrong, you looked messed up.
- Yeah, I know.

99
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,178
I'd say Manuel.

100
00:08:28,855 --> 00:08:29,913
They're playing really well.

101
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,317
I think they'll get
the cup this time.

102
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,888
You can't say that,
you're in South London.

103
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,859
There he goes again...
to eat some meat.

104
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,022
It's football.

105
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,596
Chelsea's my team.

106
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:41,859
It's everything for me.

107
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,595
You know what, five years ago...

108
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,728
...I almost played for them.

109
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:46,863
Yes, I went out and had
drinks with them. - Yes.

110
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,998
It was great.

111
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,266
What happened then?

112
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,003
I had an accident.

113
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:55,609
That was the end of my life.

114
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:57,878
Sad, buddy.
- Yes.

115
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,047
It's nine. She's going to kill me.

116
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,287
It was lovely taking to you, buddy.

117
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,691
See you.
- See you.

118
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,626
And now the GB Shaw award for...

119
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,697
...the highest selling magazine
2009 goes to Cosmopolitan.

120
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:24,306
And congratulations
Cosmopolitan for the third time.

121
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,641
Can we please have the
editor of the magazine...

122
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,371
...Ms. Gehna Sinha to
collect the award.

123
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,842
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,346
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

125
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:37,714
Thank you.

126
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:45,197
Every time I hold this award, it
just feels like the first time.

127
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,669
And the truth is, this
wouldn't have been possible...

128
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,035
...without the support
of my dedicated team.

129
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:59,804
Thank you.

130
00:10:05,184 --> 00:10:06,742
Congratulations.

131
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,787
Congratulations. Congratulations.

132
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,321
I'm not talking to you.

133
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:17,226
Do you have any clue... how
beautiful you're looking?

134
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,865
Arman, you're late.

135
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,027
Wrong answer.
Absolutely wrong answer.

136
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:23,159
But let's try it again. Okay.

137
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:27,867
Do you have any clue...
how beautiful you're looking?

138
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:30,033
You missed my speech.

139
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:31,235
I did not, I swear.

140
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,369
I heard half of it on the stairs...

141
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,436
...and the rest while standing here.
I promise you, I swear.

142
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,979
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,
I love you.

143
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,109
I'm so sorry.

144
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:40,379
Come on, let's meet dad.
- Dad!

145
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,045
Is it necessary to meet
dad on every occasion?

146
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:43,452
Forget dad.
- I love you.

147
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,089
I'm so sorry.
- I don't want to meet him.

148
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,786
Do I have to meet him all the time?

149
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:49,052
Oh, my...

150
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:51,458
So, you didn't want to see me?

151
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:52,789
No, it's not that.

152
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,993
I was just telling Gehna,
Let's go see dad. - Yes.

153
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,366
Yes. - Oh, so that's
what you were saying.

154
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:00,930
How are you?

155
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,838
Or, are you still like that?

156
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,310
Whatever, I'm all yours.

157
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,745
This occasion reminds me of a poem.

158
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:10,874
Dad, not now, please.

159
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,384
It's very nice,
dear, really very nice.

160
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,114
What have I done?

161
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:20,414
What have I done to upset God?

162
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:25,760
In my perfect family,
He sent a drunkard son-in-law.

163
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:29,299
Cheers. Cheers.

164
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:42,839
What can I get you?

165
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,007
Jack and coke.

166
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:45,241
Thanks.

167
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,409
Hey, Arman.

168
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:48,511
What!

169
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:49,981
Shut it, moron.

170
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:53,087
Wow.
- Damn good.

171
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:55,786
See, this is how you
should dress up. - Okay, okay.

172
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:56,920
Come here.

173
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,088
Is she a model?

174
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:00,427
Why is she getting so physical?

175
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,398
It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

176
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,330
They aren't hugging like friends.

177
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:10,807
She seems to be more personal.

178
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:14,813
Hey, Gehna.
- Mini, wow, you look different.

179
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:17,406
Thank you.
- Different, she's looking hot.

180
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,815
I don't know all that
because I'm feeling very strange.

181
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,547
Because I'm not
comfortable with this girly stuff.

182
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:23,213
Why today?

183
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:24,881
Because of Arman.

184
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,255
He bought me this dress and said...

185
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,089
...don't come to the party
if you don't wear this dress.

186
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:32,891
Okay, shots for this lovely girl.

187
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,949
When the drums are beating.

188
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,950
Everyone's looking so stunning.

189
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,953
The girl asks the boy.

190
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,957
When the drums are beating.

191
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,049
Everyone's looking so stunning.

192
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,993
Then the girl asks the boy.

193
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,058
Why shouldn't I sing and dance?

194
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,066
Why shouldn't I trot my beauty?

195
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,466
Why shouldn't I say...

196
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:12,970
Tell me, baby.

197
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:15,063
There's fun in my heart.

198
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:17,039
My body dances.

199
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:21,375
Don't try to stop me.

200
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,312
DJ, give me some more.

201
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,350
Hear me, my sweetheart.

202
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:27,316
DJ give me some more.

203
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,411
Lock eyes with me.

204
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,353
DJ, give me some more.

205
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:33,322
Lock eyes with me.

206
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,394
DJ, give me some more.

207
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:38,259
We'll live happily.

208
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:13,087
There's fun around.

209
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,100
Why should the heart crave?

210
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:19,228
Remember, youth isn't eternal.

211
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,135
Come dwell in my heart.

212
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:23,141
Come in my arms.

213
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:27,338
Remember, I belong to
you and you belong to me.

214
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:29,073
You sway in a manner.

215
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:31,013
My heart skips a beat.

216
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,244
How do I explain it?

217
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,019
Tell me, baby.

218
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,089
There's fun around.

219
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,055
Why should the heart crave?

220
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:43,356
Don't try to stop me.

221
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:45,430
DJ, give me some more.

222
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,396
Hear me, my sweetheart.

223
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,365
DJ, give me some more.

224
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:51,493
Lock eyes with me.

225
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:53,402
DJ, give me some more.

226
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,497
Lock eyes with me.

227
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,439
DJ, give me some more.

228
00:14:57,543 --> 00:15:03,140
We'll live happily.

229
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,005
Arman. - What is it? - 
Come to the studios. - Coming.

230
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,135
Now, Arman, now!

231
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,217
Siddharth, get me the images
of yesterday's photo shoot.

232
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:46,525
Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Okay, okay.

233
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,760
Here.
- I'm dying to see them.

234
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:52,053
Have you marked them?
- Yes.

235
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,699
Hey, daddy.
- Hi, dear.

236
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,065
What are you doing here?
- Hello, Mr. Sinha. - Hi.

237
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,034
I was close by for a meeting.

238
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,539
So I thought I should come see you.
- Great!

239
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,699
How is it going?

240
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:05,471
Arman did a photo shoot.

241
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:07,239
Just take a look at these images.

242
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:10,045
They look out of focus.

243
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:11,174
Hey, Arman.

244
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:12,442
Arman.

245
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,052
How are you?

246
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,648
Or...
- Still the same.

247
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:27,124
Arman, let's have a
different father-son talk. - Okay.

248
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,793
Who knows when you'll
be sober again?

249
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,528
Come.

250
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:35,404
Come.
- Stop him, please. Come on.

251
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,699
Please, excuse us.

252
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,171
One moment.

253
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:43,338
One moment.
- God.

254
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:44,540
Carry on, carry on.

255
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:53,154
So, you want to marry my daughter.

256
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,726
That's what I'm trying to do.

257
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,355
Gehna is my daughter.

258
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:58,560
She's not a bottle of scotch...

259
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:01,623
...which you can
uncork and gobble down.

260
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:05,827
You have all the qualities...

261
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:09,139
...that I don't want
in my son-in-law.

262
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:11,133
You can try your best.

263
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:15,179
But I can't let my
daughter marry a drunkard.

264
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,709
You seem to have a lot of
free time today. - Shut up!

265
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,846
Baby, I need to use the loo.

266
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:23,644
No.
- Yes.

267
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:26,214
No, don't go.
- Quiet.

268
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,776
Am I on your table or something?
- No.

269
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,610
So, are you here to take my order?

270
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:51,577
You can crack bad jokes.

271
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,786
Stay drunk the entire night.

272
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:59,214
Irresponsible person,
useless man, totally useless.

273
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,416
Idiot!

274
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,890
Look, I'm minding it...

275
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,790
Get out of here. Go.

276
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:10,230
Get out, out, out, leave.

277
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:12,463
Stupid.
- Idiot.

278
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,169
What a weirdo.

279
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:21,844
A foolish man just abused me.
- Really? Who was he?

280
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,176
I don't know who he was.

281
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,509
I saw him for the first time.

282
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:27,552
And... I forgot milk.
- Black is good.

283
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:33,221
Kapoor sir, it's useless
to waste our time after him.

284
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,717
We'll have to find
someone else like him.

285
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:39,320
It's difficult to find
another man like him.

286
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,397
He'll do my job.

287
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:47,763
You seemed to be getting
very friendly with dad.

288
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,305
What were you talking about?

289
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:50,466
He was saying thank you.

290
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:51,804
Oh.
- Really?

291
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:54,812
Why?
- I'm marrying you.

292
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:57,212
And when are you
going to stop drinking?

293
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,751
I don't drink because I like it.
- Really?

294
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:00,910
Yes, see

295
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,254
Drinking is not my problem,
it's my solution.

296
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:05,880
Shut up, Arman, that's
what all alcoholics say.

297
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,425
By the way, what is your problem?

298
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,653
To begin with, I can't sleep.

299
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:12,759
Do you think about me?

300
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,965
I think about sleeping.
- Okay?

301
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,599
Oh, you don't think about me.

302
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,668
Yes, I do when I'm awake.

303
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,501
So, you think about me
only when you're awake.

304
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,874
How can I think about
you when I'm asleep?

305
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:27,673
You can dream. - I don't
have control over my dreams...

306
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:29,236
You can't control your drinking...

307
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:32,250
...you can't control your dreams,
what can you control?

308
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,615
What are you saying?
- I'm absolutely right.

309
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,745
These days, you spend
most of your time with Mini.

310
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:39,256
How did Mini come between all this...

311
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:41,920
Okay, tell me. When was the
last time you brought me flowers?

312
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:43,791
Flowers... there you go.

313
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,830
Thanks. - What do you think you're
doing? - That's not the point.

314
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:47,262
Then what is?
- When was the last time...

315
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,995
...we had a
candlelight dinner together?

316
00:19:52,404 --> 00:19:54,634
See, that's exactly my point.

317
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,271
These days, you
spend most of your time...

318
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:58,674
...buying dresses for people.

319
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,642
That is the problem.

320
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,307
Jealous!
- No, I'm not jealous.

321
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,908
Okay, I'll tell you what.

322
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:09,646
Today, I'll spend the
entire day with you.

323
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:13,019
And cook a superb meal at night.

324
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:14,383
Really?

325
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:17,018
And I'll... cook muffins for you.

326
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,424
Muffins.

327
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:23,934
'Gehna's muffins were
nothing less than a season ball.'

328
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:26,368
'Will I get some water?
- Yes. Sure.'

329
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:27,865
The last time I had one of them...

330
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,372
'... I had to visit the dentist...

331
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:35,371
'God.'

332
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:39,976
'Did you hear anything? '

333
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,826
I was thinking about
champagne and strawberry.

334
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:51,954
Yeah, but with chocolate cake.

335
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:54,328
Done, chocolate cake.
Done with this, thank you.

336
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,658
Come.

337
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:58,997
How much do you love me?
- More than chocolate.

338
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,595
Good answer.
- Yes.

339
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,340
What if suddenly I...
start snoring at nights?

340
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:06,442
Will you still marry me?
- Yes.

341
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:07,670
I'll get used to it.

342
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,839
It'll be like my lullaby.
- Okay.

343
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:13,076
And if I start sleepwalking?

344
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:17,652
Then, I'll let you know if I
want to eat chocolates at night.

345
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,720
And if I say that I
feel scared alone, then?

346
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:29,458
Then I won't ever leave you alone.

347
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:49,044
Walking on this path of love...

348
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:53,749
We came so far ahead.

349
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:57,488
I know, I promise.

350
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:02,124
I'll be wherever you are.

351
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:06,462
Believe it.
Believe it. Believe it.

352
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:10,564
Live is beautiful.

353
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:16,706
Know this.

354
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:20,942
Without love, there's nothing.

355
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,680
How do I tell you?

356
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,852
I always ask.

357
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:29,417
We are two bodies, one soul.

358
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:33,158
Walking on this path of love...

359
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,764
We came so far ahead.

360
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:07,996
Can I ask you something?

361
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,467
Yes, I'm listening.

362
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:18,841
How much you do
believe in my love?

363
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:27,780
I believe in it more than myself.

364
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:36,157
When you say that,
you sound so sweet.

365
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:39,891
Walking on this path of love...

366
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:45,492
We came so far ahead.

367
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:18,066
It's quite late.

368
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,728
I should leave.

369
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:21,631
Please, don't go.

370
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:24,075
Stay here tonight. Please.

371
00:24:24,676 --> 00:24:26,007
Arman, you've gone mad.

372
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:27,271
Fine, I've gone mad.

373
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,838
At least, stay back now.

374
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:31,813
Don't be childish.

375
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,544
I'm asking you to
stay back tonight...

376
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,610
...does it sound childish to you?

377
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:36,779
Just go to sleep.

378
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:38,981
Goodnight.

379
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:41,751
Love you.
- I love you too.

380
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:46,563
Please, Gehna, don't go.
- Goodnight. Sleep.

381
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:48,293
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

382
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,833
We know you can hear us.

383
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,604
Great, you can hear me.
- He can.

384
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:58,232
Now listen... where are you going?
- Oh, God.

385
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,005
We just want to have a
word with you, come back.

386
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:01,306
I'm talking to you.

387
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:04,740
Calm down.

388
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:07,118
Now, we have a small problem...

389
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:11,055
Come back here, we just
want to have a word with you.

390
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,058
Don't forget your booze.
- Thank you.

391
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:18,227
I don't believe this.

392
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,630
Is that your car?
- Yes, yes, it is.

393
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm terribly sorry.

394
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:25,929
I'll just move it for you.

395
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:27,196
Thank you.

396
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:48,684
He has changed.

397
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:51,659
I noticed that too.
New haircut, right?

398
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:54,364
No, Riya. I mean, he
has changed as a person.

399
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:58,091
What do you mean?
- I mean... he has started lying.

400
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:00,638
You know. He told me
that he's going to sleep.

401
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,300
And as soon as I left his house...
he left as well.

402
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:05,371
Then he's surely having an affair.

403
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:06,872
He's stooped so low.

404
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:08,904
Yes.

405
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:10,641
Actually, he's spending
a long time...

406
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:11,774
...with his assistant Mini.

407
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:12,942
No.

408
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:25,327
Milli, just fix Lola's hair.

409
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,722
What are you doing?

410
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:28,197
Sometimes white, sometimes telly.
I don't understand.

411
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,325
What? What are you shooting?

412
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:32,893
Look, firstly... these two
don't inspire me one bit.

413
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:35,035
And who brought this
absurd swimsuit? - This.

414
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,698
Your fashion consultant,
your choice.

415
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:37,935
Please, don't tell me anything.

416
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,204
Change her, please.
- Okay, will do.

417
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:40,336
Come on, let's finish this
and leave. - Okay.

418
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:41,879
Come on, guys, let's go.
- Let's go.

419
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:44,740
Yes.

420
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:50,946
Oh, God...

421
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:53,415
What happened?

422
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,125
Nothing.

423
00:27:06,738 --> 00:27:08,706
Doc, there were at least 40 people...

424
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:10,105
...standing before my
camera today that weren't there.

425
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,334
Where did you sleep last night?

426
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:13,372
At the railway station, as usual.

427
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,812
At least there, I can
see who is speaking to me.

428
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:18,407
At least, I'm not scared.

429
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:20,409
You know something, doc.

430
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,243
I've spent two nights at Amit's.

431
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:23,983
I've spent two nights at Mini's.

432
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:25,787
But it isn't making any difference.

433
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:30,024
The problem isn't in
the house, it's in you.

434
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,828
Why don't you tell
Gehna about your problem?

435
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:39,066
Oh... what do I tell her, doc?
What do I tell her?

436
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:40,733
I don't know
anything about my problem...

437
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:42,034
...what will I tell her?

438
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:45,740
If someone tells me that he
hears voices when he's alone...

439
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:47,745
...or that he's
scared of sleeping alone...

440
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:50,338
...l'll feel, either he's
gone mad, or he's a coward.

441
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:52,207
Damn.

442
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:53,342
What do I do?

443
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:56,182
You aren't mad or a coward.

444
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:59,313
You're just suffering
from exhaustion. That's all.

445
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:04,756
Look, when we're very tired or
we don't get adequate sleep...

446
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,061
...then sometimes... we
start hallucinating.

447
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:12,294
So, all I want you to do
is relax. Right. - Yes.

448
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,869
Hi, Harry.
- Hi, how are you?

449
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:18,772
Got my book?
- Just give me a minute.

450
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:34,782
If you see it, it's there.

451
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:36,151
Arman.
- Yes.

452
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:37,286
Here's your book.

453
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:38,956
Thanks, buddy, I'll be there.
- No problem.

454
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:40,089
I'm there.

455
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:46,801
Here you go.
- Thanks.

456
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:59,849
If you see it, it's there.

457
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:03,812
It's a useful book
if you believe in it.

458
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:06,915
If you don't,
it's... science fiction.

459
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:10,520
My name is Kapoor.
- I'm Arman.

460
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,957
Is reading this book worthwhile?
- Of course.

461
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:15,157
Sure.

462
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:22,398
Are you scared of ghosts?
- What?

463
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,941
It's a simple question.
Are you scared of ghosts?

464
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,272
I'm a normal man. Of course,
I'm scared of them.

465
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:31,306
Really?

466
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,845
Then why weren't you
scared of the man...

467
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,217
...whom you were
going to hit in the cafe?

468
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,853
And the boy that you're
talking to about football...

469
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:43,588
...in this pub,
he died five years ago.

470
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,915
Have another drink,
you'll feel relaxed.

471
00:30:11,223 --> 00:30:15,523
Who are you? - I just told
you in the club, I'm Kapoor.

472
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:18,021
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

473
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:23,429
I'm a ghost, I'm dead.

474
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:26,069
And you see dead people.

475
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,172
Oh, God!

476
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:09,938
This is not happening.

477
00:31:17,088 --> 00:31:18,146
What happened?

478
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,251
Why are you scared?
- Because you're a ghost.

479
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,423
So? What do you think?

480
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:28,963
When a person dies...

481
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:30,695
...he develops a
disease to scare people.

482
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:35,572
Do you think it's a
Michael Jackson video?

483
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,504
It's very insulting you know.

484
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,045
Why are you all after me?

485
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,614
Because you see dead people,
don't you understand?

486
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,716
Call it your power or bad luck.

487
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,987
Just solve a few of our problems...

488
00:31:57,062 --> 00:32:00,725
...and we'll get salvation,
and things like that.

489
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,057
Yes, I am sure.

490
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:05,298
I went crazy looking for you.

491
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:06,995
All the time...

492
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:10,099
Sorry.
- What happened?

493
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:12,067
Sorry about...

494
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:16,003
You sleep in crowded places...

495
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:17,514
...where you can't hear our voices.

496
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:22,413
Are you going to help us or not?

497
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,518
Lf... what if I say no?

498
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:36,023
No, no, it's not a problem.

499
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:37,693
This will continue.

500
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:40,503
You'll work without sleeping.

501
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:44,701
One day, you'll die of boozing.

502
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:46,038
Then someday, we'll meet...

503
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:48,045
...and search for a man like you.

504
00:32:48,713 --> 00:32:49,771
It's not a problem.

505
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:55,046
Will you give me some time to think?

506
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:57,782
Because it's a difficult decision.

507
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:00,282
Of course.
- Thank you.

508
00:33:00,358 --> 00:33:02,053
Of course. Take your time.

509
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,688
I have all the time.

510
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:10,327
And how will you contact us
when you're done thinking?

511
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,195
Shall I give you my mobile number?
- Yes.

512
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:21,269
You poor thing.

513
00:33:21,346 --> 00:33:22,404
I see dead people.

514
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,141
Ghosts.

515
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,814
How will I explain this to Gehna?

516
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:32,120
I tried calling you so many times...

517
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:33,450
...why didn't you answer my call?

518
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,751
Because you didn't answer my call.
- When?

519
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,689
The other night,
when I left from your home.

520
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:40,389
You know I called you.

521
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:44,334
That day, my phone's
battery was low...

522
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:45,630
...I kept it for charging.

523
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,095
Correct. You went to Mini's house...

524
00:33:48,173 --> 00:33:49,231
...to get it charged, didn't you?

525
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:53,100
I went down to get milk.
- Yeah, right.

526
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:54,569
I swear.

527
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:00,109
Are you cheating on me?
- What?

528
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,510
How can you say that?

529
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:05,115
How can you even think of that?

530
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,248
You're hiding something from me.

531
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:07,655
You've done something wrong.

532
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,252
I haven't done anything wrong...

533
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:11,488
...and don't talk like a crazy,
suspecting woman.

534
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,259
Come here, on this side.
- What? - Come, come, come.

535
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,191
How many people do
you see standing there?

536
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,325
What kind of a question is that?

537
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:18,460
Just answer my question.

538
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:21,600
You want to know whether
I can count or not. - Just...

539
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,574
Okay. God!

540
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:25,867
Five.

541
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:29,136
Is it possible that
you can see five...

542
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:31,148
...but there are more than
five people standing there?

543
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:37,150
Baby, do you want a nice,
strong black coffee?

544
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:40,682
Listen.

545
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,150
Has it ever happened that...

546
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:44,593
...you heard someone call you...

547
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:47,154
...but when you turned around,
there wasn't anyone there.

548
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:48,797
No.
- No.

549
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:50,659
But there are things that...

550
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,794
...we don't know about,
what about that?

551
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:55,764
I don't believe what I don't know.

552
00:34:56,174 --> 00:34:57,232
It's as simple as that.

553
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:11,413
Hello.

554
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:13,381
Is anybody there?

555
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:17,858
I'm Arman Suri.

556
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:25,868
And my address is
143... Albert House. Cagne street.

557
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:27,199
Opposite Richmond Park.

558
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,203
And please, take the service road...

559
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,800
...because there's a lot of traffic
on the main road at this time.

560
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,214
What am I blabbering?

561
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:41,314
You talk so much every day.

562
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:44,446
Where are you today?

563
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:52,219
Okay, okay, I need to concentrate.

564
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:58,361
Wandering souls.

565
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:01,429
Please, come to me.

566
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:06,336
Look... I'm ready.

567
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:12,916
I... I'll get you salvation.

568
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:16,249
Aimless wandering souls...

569
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:21,918
...l'll help you break
through these barriers.

570
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:26,763
See, because... I'm the one.

571
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:30,401
Something like...
Keanu Reeves in Matrix...

572
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:35,496
I have the power like... He-man.

573
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:37,269
Come to me.

574
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,334
Come on.

575
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:41,336
Arman. Arman.

576
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:44,005
Oh, God.

577
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:46,575
So many!

578
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,009
Who are all of you?

579
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:51,286
You're the host, we,
the ghost. Remember?

580
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,287
All of you are ghosts.

581
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:54,882
These days, anybody
gets blessed with power.

582
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,017
Him?

583
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:58,954
Quiet!

584
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:03,892
Shall we begin?

585
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:09,036
What is your problem?

586
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,931
I want you to go to India?
- Why?

587
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:13,501
To play cricket.

588
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:15,978
I don't know how to play cricket.

589
00:37:16,314 --> 00:37:17,838
You don't have to play.

590
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:18,974
I'll be playing it.

591
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,042
Your body and my talent. Simple.

592
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:24,946
Excuse me.

593
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,617
What is he blabbering?

594
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:30,726
Will I have to go to
India and play cricket?

595
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:33,326
I'll have to solve
such ridiculous problems.

596
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:34,456
Do I have to?

597
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,659
Arman, you can choose.
- Yeah?

598
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:37,996
Yes, you can choose.
- Can I?

599
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:40,469
You can solve
any problem you want to.

600
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:42,329
Do I have a choice?
- Yes.

601
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:43,565
But think about it.

602
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:49,580
If you do this job, then money,
fame, endorsements, a Ferrari.

603
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:59,654
Next.
- I want to live for a 100 years.

604
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:01,082
100 years.

605
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,353
Satyajit Ray.

606
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:05,954
'Apur Sansar' Black and white.

607
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:08,021
I want to make black
and white films.

608
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,363
Please, help me get rid of my wife.

609
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:12,369
She isn't leaving me alone,
though she's dead.

610
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:13,734
I don't want your help.

611
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:15,739
I won't ever stop
chasing my husband.

612
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,371
I want to marry an Indian girl.

613
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:21,978
About 20.
- Just...

614
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,674
40.
- Just...

615
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:25,807
55.

616
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,746
Next.
- I want to kill my three wives.

617
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:31,481
There's a girl
I'm madly in love with.

618
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:32,915
But I couldn't tell her that.

619
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:35,757
What is her name?
- Ash.

620
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:38,687
Aishwarya Rai.

621
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:40,857
Actress Aishwarya Rai.

622
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:43,730
You know her. Please,
help me meet her once.

623
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,436
Why are you... does it look like
I've opened a fan mail office here?

624
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:50,397
I want to meet
my four year old child.

625
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:53,637
And I've to find him.

626
00:38:55,613 --> 00:39:00,414
It's... going to be difficult,
I know, but...

627
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:09,484
Finally.

628
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:12,020
Finally, a genuine problem.

629
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:14,591
She wants to find her son.

630
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,760
Meet Aishwarya, become a hero.

631
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:20,499
I will solve her problem first.

632
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:22,763
And then, we'll have
this meeting again.

633
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,102
Then we'll choose
the next candidate.

634
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:26,166
And I hope you have
a genuine problem.

635
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:27,502
Get out.

636
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:28,875
That Japanese man is much better.

637
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:30,436
Let's go to Madame Tussauds museum.

638
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:32,676
I'll pacify myself with
Aishwarya Rai's statue.

639
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:38,847
What a day!

640
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:41,182
Strange ghosts.

641
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:46,453
Mr. Kapoor, thank you very much.

642
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:49,524
You've helped me a lot,
I really needed that.

643
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:52,527
Thank you.
- You're welcome, Arman.

644
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,772
But Arman, what about my problem?

645
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,135
Of course.

646
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:00,942
As soon as I solve
Carol's problem, after that.

647
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:04,481
After that?

648
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,210
What do you mean by after that?

649
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:10,484
Calm down.
- Calm down.

650
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:13,620
I'm dead, I can't be any calmer.

651
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,022
Do you want me to
do deep breathing?

652
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,151
Hello, listen, young man.

653
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,491
I'm the one who
solved your problems.

654
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:21,088
Because of you?
- Oh, yes, because of me.

655
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,223
Not because of you.

656
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,491
You'll be sleeping peacefully
on your bed today because of me.

657
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:26,161
No, no, no.
- Arman.

658
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:28,501
You aren't doing me a favour,
I'm doing a favour on you.

659
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:30,564
Arman.
- Traitor.

660
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:32,802
Mr. Kapoor is absolutely right.

661
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:36,012
And anyway, he has a
very small problem.

662
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:37,879
It has been decided.

663
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,517
I'll see how he refuses.

664
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:41,643
Are you scaring me?

665
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:43,544
I'm not scared of you people.

666
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:44,679
You can do whatever you want to.

667
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:46,581
He's threatening me.

668
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:48,583
I need a drink.

669
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,597
You're rubbing salt on my wounds.

670
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:56,593
Just watch what I do to you.

671
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:24,219
What's going on?

672
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,700
You think you can
scare me like this.

673
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:32,597
By making me sleep on
the road amidst traffic

674
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:35,837
Will you do my job or not?
- I won't.

675
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,635
You won't do my job?
- No, I won't.

676
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:39,971
I won't let you sleep.
- Will do.

677
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:41,568
I won't let you sleep
the entire week. - Will do.

678
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:42,977
You won't do my job?
- No, I won't.

679
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:44,105
No.
- No.

680
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:50,211
Hello, ladies, how would you
like to come home with me?

681
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:52,851
No, no, no, I didn't do it.

682
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,084
Listen, there's a ghost.

683
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,251
He's standing there.

684
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:57,589
You can't see him.
I can see. Sorry, sorry.

685
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:00,989
You should be ashamed.

686
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:02,589
What were you making me do?

687
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:04,758
Those three boys
were going to thrash me.

688
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:06,600
My original plan was...

689
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:09,071
...to take you to a gay
bar and leave you there.

690
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:10,699
You would've been raped there.

691
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:11,969
No.
- Yes.

692
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:14,608
But I thought about
Gehna and forgave you.

693
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,203
Thank you...
- Now, the magic question is...

694
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,840
...will you do my work or not?
- No.

695
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,259
What's left to do?

696
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:34,788
Yes. Bungee jumping from the
Big Ben. Without the rope.

697
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:38,633
And it was my childhood wish...

698
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:42,230
...to thrust my head
inside a crocodile's mouth.

699
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:49,108
And I had a desire
to do the cabaret.

700
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:50,772
Skimpy clothes.

701
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,748
Youthful and
beautiful girlfriend.

702
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:55,176
Have you gone mad?

703
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:56,915
I never steal anything.

704
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:58,713
And you want me to rob a bank.

705
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:01,720
You don't need to rob it.

706
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,384
It's my money you just
have to withdraw it.

707
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,652
Look, it's your money.

708
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,197
And it'll be
stealing if I withdrew it.

709
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:08,757
And what will I tell them?

710
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,334
Mr. Kapoor is
holidaying in heaven...

711
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,302
...and he has sent me
to go get some money.

712
00:43:14,672 --> 00:43:16,765
Sometimes,
I forget that I'm dead.

713
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,137
How can you forget?

714
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:21,269
How can you forget?

715
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:23,071
Crazy man.

716
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:27,014
Help me, Arman, please.

717
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:30,820
Look, I need time for this.

718
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:38,685
So?
- What, so?

719
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:40,755
What have you thought?

720
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:43,231
You're talking about
taking money out of the bank...

721
00:43:43,301 --> 00:43:44,700
...and not beer from the fridge.

722
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:46,227
What have you thought?

723
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:52,273
How much time do you
need approximately?

724
00:43:57,848 --> 00:43:59,816
What is it?
- I need to talk to you.

725
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:02,310
Will you treat me to lunch?
- Yes, I will.

726
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:03,944
Come in.

727
00:44:04,722 --> 00:44:06,053
Hi.
- You're here too.

728
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,885
Duffer, you're the
one who's come here.

729
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:11,722
Everywhere you go.

730
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:13,263
My soul will follow you.

731
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:15,123
Shut up!
- You shut up!

732
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:16,996
You came here to say that.
- No.

733
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:18,262
I'm not talking to you.

734
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:19,794
I was...

735
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:23,197
I won't help you.

736
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:24,999
You'll rot in hell.

737
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:26,740
Who are you talking to?

738
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:29,838
I'm talking to a ghost
that has driven me crazy.

739
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:31,472
Ghost.

740
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,247
Okay, I'm coming, you go.

741
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:40,018
You were saying.

742
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:45,862
Fine, I'll do your job.

743
00:44:46,464 --> 00:44:49,297
But I have one... three conditions.

744
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:55,834
First condition. You won't
make my things fly in the air.

745
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,203
No flying statues
and 'Bajrang Balis'.

746
00:44:58,909 --> 00:44:59,967
Rule no. 2.

747
00:45:00,111 --> 00:45:03,376
You won't walk through
walls in my house.

748
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:04,812
Especially,
when I'm in the bathroom.

749
00:45:05,783 --> 00:45:06,841
And rule no. 3.

750
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:09,778
Last night, you displayed
that ridiculous special effect...

751
00:45:09,854 --> 00:45:12,823
...of entering my body...
don't ever do that again.

752
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:16,783
I need to tell you a small detail.

753
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:22,789
We can only enter
the body of a person...

754
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:25,392
...that can either see or hear us.

755
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:29,397
Congratulations, darling.

756
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,107
You're done for.

757
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:36,913
Next time, you enter my body...

758
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:38,880
You can solve your
problems yourself.

759
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:40,943
Mini, I'm waiting for you outside.

760
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,819
If he would've been alive,
I would've killed him.

761
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:47,822
Who does he keep talking to?

762
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:50,817
Wait, I'll get changed
and be there in 10 minutes.

763
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:01,095
Your phone is ringing.

764
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,831
Phone.
- Phone.

765
00:46:09,146 --> 00:46:11,444
Gehna, why did you call?

766
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:12,846
What do you mean by why I called?

767
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:14,943
What are you doing for lunch?

768
00:46:16,854 --> 00:46:17,912
Just a minute.

769
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,921
Can we meet in the evening?

770
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:23,084
I'm leaving for Manchester
in the evening for three days.

771
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,923
Better get yourself
treated until then.

772
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,534
A photo shoot has come up suddenly.

773
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,168
Photo shoot.
Why didn't you tell me?

774
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:39,474
Actually, Andy's mother is ill.

775
00:46:40,878 --> 00:46:42,368
Is Andy's mother
conducting the photo shoot?

776
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,940
No, no, Andy's mother
isn't shooting, I am.

777
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:47,375
Andy is sick.

778
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:49,279
I feel you had drank
too much last night.

779
00:46:50,054 --> 00:46:51,180
Anyway, you call me, okay?
- Okay.

780
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:53,890
I love you.
- Me too.

781
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,152
Bye.
- Bye.

782
00:46:58,062 --> 00:46:59,962
Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

783
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,088
You're welcome.

784
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:11,374
Why are you sulking?

785
00:47:11,442 --> 00:47:13,137
Everything will be fine.
- Here.

786
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,368
Everyday you go
overboard with your drinks.

787
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:15,503
Have a cup of coffee today.

788
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:17,905
I'm telling you such
a serious problem...

789
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:19,279
...and it doesn't make
any difference to you.

790
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:21,917
Now do you
understand what I used to say?

791
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:24,250
It didn't make any difference
to you when I was telling you.

792
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:25,379
What did I tell you?

793
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,915
The body perishes, not the soul.

794
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:30,119
The soul is eternal.

795
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:31,452
But what did you call me?

796
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:32,653
Crazy witch doctor.

797
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:33,924
Who is crazy? You or me?

798
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:36,460
Gehna, by which
route are you taking me?

799
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:38,161
This is so bloody ridiculous.

800
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:39,929
It's a shorter route, Riya.

801
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:44,365
By the way, Riya,
Roberto Cavalli is on sale.

802
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:46,370
60% off on everything.

803
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:47,941
Are you kidding me?

804
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:50,070
I'm so excited.

805
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:53,007
What happened?

806
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:03,692
Hey, don't be stupid.

807
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:05,421
Do you want to argue
on the streets?

808
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:06,621
He's not worth it.

809
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:09,956
Let's go.
- Yes, you're right.

810
00:48:12,136 --> 00:48:13,330
Look, hot girls.

811
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:16,567
'What are you doing for lunch? '

812
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:18,698
'I'm shooting, Andy is sick.'

813
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:30,249
'Then I'm sure he's
having an affair.'

814
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:31,987
'He has stooped so low.'

815
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:37,324
Yes, Gehna. - Sarah, get
Andy for tomorrow's shoot.

816
00:48:37,394 --> 00:48:38,452
Andy?

817
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:45,526
What's going on?

818
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,728
I'm making tea.

819
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,297
Would you like to have some?

820
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,005
Oh, no, how can you have it?

821
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:56,001
Lts alcohol content
is only 0.3 percent.

822
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,338
Really?

823
00:48:58,415 --> 00:48:59,473
You know what I mean?

824
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:01,746
Why did you give my
assignment to Andy?

825
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:04,145
Simple.

826
00:49:04,388 --> 00:49:07,016
Because Andy doesn't wish
his girlfriend goodnight...

827
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:09,616
...and go spend the
night with someone else.

828
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:12,027
Andy doesn't lie to his girlfriend.

829
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,331
Andy doesn't cheat
on his girlfriend...

830
00:49:14,498 --> 00:49:19,026
...because Andy is not a
double-crossing, two-timing person.

831
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:20,770
How do you know Andy so...

832
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:24,036
You think I...

833
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:26,368
I don't think, Arman, I can see it.

834
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:28,635
Now, you'll say those old
recurring dialogue again.

835
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:29,770
These photographs are fake.

836
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:31,041
These photographs are fake.

837
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:32,207
You're sick! You make me sick!

838
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:33,341
Just get out of here!

839
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:35,711
Come on, Gehna,
what's wrong with you?

840
00:49:35,786 --> 00:49:37,048
You know what's wrong with me.

841
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:40,048
By the way, how was the
photo shoot yesterday?

842
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:42,319
It was good, why?
- Really?

843
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,718
What were you shooting?

844
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:47,523
Mini's Caesar's salad.

845
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:49,528
Or your pepperoni pizza.
- God!

846
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:52,225
Or was it the sweet
nothings or the melting moments?

847
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:53,361
Have you sent that fax to New York?

848
00:49:53,437 --> 00:49:55,405
Fax? Oh yes, of course.
- Thanks, buddy.

849
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,401
I swear, I was about to tell you...
- Yes.

850
00:49:58,475 --> 00:49:59,806
And a truck passed by
right then, isn't it?

851
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:02,506
Gehna, I love you.

852
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:05,412
I can't even think about
anyone else... - Just shut up.

853
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,745
Save your cheesy dialogue
for your next girlfriend.

854
00:50:09,086 --> 00:50:11,077
Call up Mini, she'll
tell you everything.

855
00:50:11,422 --> 00:50:14,084
Dad, I'm leaving Arman.
- What?

856
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,724
It's nothing to laugh about.

857
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:18,159
I've dumped Arman.

858
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:20,091
You were mentioning
about that proposal...

859
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:21,256
...from Birmingham.
- Proposal.

860
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:23,698
What was his name?
- That spare part dealer.

861
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:24,825
No, not that one.

862
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:26,096
That horse dealer.
- Horse dealer.

863
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,535
You know what, it
really doesn't matter.

864
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:28,730
It'll be your choice and
I'll be ready to marry him.

865
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:30,273
Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

866
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:31,535
And you're so not invited.

867
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:33,701
Gehna.

868
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:35,108
Gehna, what are you doing?

869
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:37,346
I mean, me and Mini...
for God sake...

870
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,348
You're mistaken.
- Mistaken.

871
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:40,708
Mistaken.

872
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:42,718
It would've been a big
mistake to marry you.

873
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,486
Listen, baby. Please, listen to me.

874
00:50:45,556 --> 00:50:47,581
You know what, Arman,
just shut up and get out...

875
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:49,250
...and don't you dare
bang that door.

876
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,128
There is no door here.
- Whatever! Just leave.

877
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:53,521
Listen.

878
00:50:55,632 --> 00:50:57,725
So, that's final,
you're leaving me.

879
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:00,399
I'll send you the
marriage card as proof...

880
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:02,132
...and you'll still not be invited.

881
00:51:02,873 --> 00:51:04,807
You won't let me say
anything in my defence.

882
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:07,139
Nothing at all, no chance.
- No chance.

883
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:08,803
Are you sure?

884
00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:11,279
Have you lost your sense of
hearing along with your brains?

885
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:16,608
So, you've decided
that we're separating.

886
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:18,149
Right?
- Right.

887
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:21,556
So, I'll say anything I want,
whatever I want.

888
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:25,152
I'll vent out my anger,
you can't rebuke at me.

889
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:28,627
Because we aren't going to
meet again, right? - Right.

890
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:30,428
We'll never meet again.
- Good.

891
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:33,392
You think I'm dying
to get married to you.

892
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:36,234
You can't leave me
because I'm leaving you.

893
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:37,773
Crazy girl.
- Arman.

894
00:51:37,841 --> 00:51:39,900
To hell with Arman
and to hell with you...

895
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:41,644
...you freaking psycho.
- How dare...

896
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:46,842
You know, I'm tired of
your constant nagging...

897
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:50,717
Oh, God, I hate your muffins.

898
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:53,188
You know what, your
muffins are actually weapons.

899
00:51:53,257 --> 00:51:56,192
If I hurl it towards a building,
the building will collapse...

900
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,194
...but your muffins won't
get a scratch. You know that.

901
00:51:58,262 --> 00:52:00,321
Security.
- No, no, no.

902
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:03,195
Not security, insecurity.

903
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:05,667
You can never feel
secure with anyone...

904
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:07,203
...you insecure woman.

905
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:09,739
Go and get yourself
treated from some witch doctor.

906
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:12,207
Get that. Crazy suspecting woman.

907
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:15,268
Where were you? Why
didn't you answer my call?

908
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:17,210
What's that red
stuff on your collar?

909
00:52:17,281 --> 00:52:18,748
Why aren't their
beans on the papaya?

910
00:52:18,816 --> 00:52:20,215
Why are their
scratches on the CD?

911
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:21,342
And the doorbell...

912
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:29,486
That must have really hurt.
Poor guy.

913
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:30,951
You're sick.

914
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:32,957
Get back to work all of you.

915
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:47,671
Uncle, where is Gehna?
- There she is.

916
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:50,709
How dare you? What is your problem?

917
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:53,580
How dare I? What is my problem?

918
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:54,776
I'll be right...
- Wait right here.

919
00:52:54,852 --> 00:52:55,910
How can you? How can you?

920
00:52:55,986 --> 00:52:57,385
Are you mad?
Are you completely mad?

921
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:58,512
How can you even think that...

922
00:52:58,589 --> 00:52:59,886
...there's something
between me and that idiot.

923
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:01,720
Are you mad?
- How can I think like that?

924
00:53:01,792 --> 00:53:03,487
Now, you're going to say that
you're just good friends. - Yes.

925
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,754
I've seen Hindi films,
I've read magazines as well.

926
00:53:04,828 --> 00:53:05,886
Will you listen to me?

927
00:53:05,963 --> 00:53:07,430
Who was that sitting in
the Italian restaurant?

928
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:09,466
Your twin sister, Micromini?

929
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,865
I... I...
- I said keep seated.

930
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:13,334
Listen, listen...
- You listen to me.

931
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:15,329
The other day, on the photo shoot...

932
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:16,463
...you seemed really
glued on to him.

933
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,269
What happened?
- Were you shooting for Fevicol...

934
00:53:18,342 --> 00:53:19,639
...or someone tied you both up?

935
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:20,768
You think I'm blind?

936
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:21,902
I'm gay, damn it.

937
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:24,505
I like girls.

938
00:53:25,649 --> 00:53:27,378
Really?
- Really.

939
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,551
Really?
- Yes.

940
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:36,458
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

941
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:40,519
Come on, give me a hug.

942
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,825
Now chill, don't worry
about anything, okay?

943
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:47,695
Bye, Uncle.

944
00:53:48,972 --> 00:53:50,030
She's gay.

945
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:52,605
I'm so stupid.

946
00:53:54,645 --> 00:53:55,703
Hi.

947
00:54:01,318 --> 00:54:02,444
I'm really sorry, Arman.

948
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:05,048
I doubted you.

949
00:54:06,557 --> 00:54:07,717
And with Mini.

950
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:10,657
She doesn't like boys.

951
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:12,926
She likes girls.

952
00:54:15,732 --> 00:54:16,960
Forgive me, please.

953
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:19,330
Why should I?

954
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,933
You just believed
what someone told you.

955
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:23,063
And that too, Riya.

956
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,573
She never listens to herself.
You know...

957
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:28,577
Do you have any idea how
much I love you, idiot?

958
00:54:29,413 --> 00:54:31,005
You were ready to
marry some Minty or Monty.

959
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:33,743
I said it in a fit of rage.
I swear, I didn't mean it

960
00:54:33,817 --> 00:54:34,977
Oh, you can do
anything in a fit of rage.

961
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:37,486
You hit me with your mobile,
do you know that?

962
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:40,948
I'm... sorry.
- Violent. I'm sorry.

963
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,018
Did it hurt?

964
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:45,527
Yes. Here.

965
00:54:45,596 --> 00:54:47,530
Right here, it's swelled up.

966
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:51,366
It hurts.
- I'm sorry, baby.

967
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:54,102
I trouble you a lot, don't I?

968
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:01,106
No, not much. Sometimes.
- Sorry.

969
00:55:05,382 --> 00:55:07,373
Like one time, I wanted to
celebrate your birthday.

970
00:55:08,118 --> 00:55:09,415
I made all the arrangements.

971
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:11,479
And you cancelled everything.

972
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:14,114
You did that.

973
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:16,014
That's because I love you, Arman.

974
00:55:17,928 --> 00:55:20,920
I wanted to celebrate
with you alone.

975
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:25,059
Okay.

976
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:32,904
Remember. Once I was
going for a photo shoot.

977
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,972
And you couldn't
come along with me.

978
00:55:35,045 --> 00:55:36,410
So, you didn't let me go either.

979
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,409
That was in the Bahamas, Arman.

980
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,405
You couldn't have gone
to such a romantic place...

981
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:41,542
...without me.

982
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:44,078
Anyway, it was dad's birthday.

983
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:49,149
I don't like your dad.

984
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:51,819
Okay, I'm sorry.

985
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:55,860
Look, I'm not complaining but...

986
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:59,424
I'm telling you just
because you're asking.

987
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:05,439
Remember, one time...
- Okay, that's enough.

988
00:56:06,677 --> 00:56:10,738
Okay, sorry.

989
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:13,046
Even I said so many things to you.

990
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:16,184
I didn't mean it. I love you.
- It's okay.

991
00:56:16,987 --> 00:56:18,045
It was my fault.

992
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:26,461
Am I really a sceptical woman?
- No, not at all.

993
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:29,557
You're too sweet.
- Really?

994
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:33,834
I make really bad muffins?
- Rubbish.

995
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:36,128
I love your muffins.

996
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:38,941
Really?
- Specially, those soft juicy ones.

997
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:40,476
It tastes best when you eat it hot.
- Really?

998
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:41,875
I'll make...
- No, no, not now.

999
00:56:42,946 --> 00:56:45,881
I told you about that diet,
still on.

1000
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:50,713
Let me know whenever you feel
like eating it, I'll make it.

1001
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:53,547
Sure.

1002
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:00,220
Gehna.

1003
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,968
I want to tell you something. What?

1004
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:14,102
What?
- No. Nothing.

1005
00:57:15,512 --> 00:57:19,505
I don't want to lose you.
- Oh, baby.

1006
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:26,512
Love you too much.
- Love you too.

1007
00:57:33,964 --> 00:57:35,522
Gehna... she's very hot.

1008
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,759
If you ever change
your mind... I know...

1009
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:38,762
Hey, you stay away from her.

1010
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:42,202
I really like these homely girls.
- I do, too.

1011
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:45,002
Arman uncle! Arman uncle!

1012
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:52,742
Stop!

1013
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,208
Arman uncle!
- Stop!

1014
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:56,548
Stop running! Stop!

1015
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:01,717
Arman uncle!

1016
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:06,756
Uncle!
- Have you gone crazy?

1017
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:07,888
You shouldn't be running
on the streets like that?

1018
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:09,022
What if you had met with
an accident?

1019
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:10,157
Uncle, you have to help my father.

1020
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:11,996
Please, come with me.
My house is close by.

1021
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:13,661
What happened?
- Come with me.

1022
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:14,895
Wait.

1023
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:16,563
Where are we going?
- Uncle, my name is Ali.

1024
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,164
My father is a boxer.

1025
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:22,238
He'll die if he fights. Please,
help my father.

1026
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:23,574
It's... some sick boxer.

1027
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:25,578
We have to stop him
from fighting. Come on.

1028
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:31,111
Is this your house?

1029
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:35,723
He's dead, but he
hasn't lost his memory.

1030
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:37,651
Is your name Ali?

1031
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:38,785
Am I talking to you?

1032
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,330
I'm dead, but I
haven't lost my memory.

1033
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:45,993
Yes.

1034
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:47,661
We...

1035
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:49,997
Who are you?

1036
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:51,265
Please leave.

1037
00:58:55,345 --> 00:58:58,337
We are... from the U.K.
Health department.

1038
00:58:58,715 --> 00:59:01,946
Yes. And we know that you
aren't fit for this fight.

1039
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:03,076
Right.
- Really?

1040
00:59:04,955 --> 00:59:07,617
Do you have
any documents to prove it?

1041
00:59:08,692 --> 00:59:09,852
Mini, give him the documents.

1042
00:59:11,695 --> 00:59:13,060
The documents are on the way.

1043
00:59:13,129 --> 00:59:14,187
They'll be here soon.

1044
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:16,629
Until then, I
suggest that you give me...

1045
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,928
...your urine sample for testing.

1046
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:19,635
Get out!
- No, no, no.

1047
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:20,761
We're Ali's friends!
We're Ali's friends!

1048
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:22,634
What you're doing is
absolutely illegal.

1049
00:59:22,706 --> 00:59:23,764
How long have you known Ali?

1050
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,898
How long?

1051
00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:26,636
I met him just a while ago.

1052
00:59:26,943 --> 00:59:28,035
Mini, do something. Mini,
do something.

1053
00:59:28,111 --> 00:59:30,170
Ali died six months ago.

1054
00:59:30,647 --> 00:59:33,047
Ali, say something that
only you know. - Calm down.

1055
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:34,640
Father cooks really well.

1056
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:35,810
Even I cook well.

1057
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:36,944
He isn't proposing to you...

1058
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,078
...that you're praising
your cooking.

1059
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:39,246
Am I talking to you? Be quiet.

1060
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:40,653
There were 40 pounds
in my piggybank.

1061
00:59:40,724 --> 00:59:42,055
There were 40 pounds
in his piggybank.

1062
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:51,664
There were 40 pounds...
in his piggybank.

1063
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:57,931
Thanks.

1064
00:59:59,342 --> 01:00:00,741
This is strange, but true.

1065
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:03,139
Ali was right there when
you were talking to the doctor.

1066
01:00:04,681 --> 01:00:08,674
'Look, Aslam, if you
suffer a blow here...

1067
01:00:08,752 --> 01:00:13,189
...you'll die right away,
or be paralysed for life.'

1068
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:20,692
'There's isn't much difference
between life and death for me now.'

1069
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,701
'Look, Doctor, I don't
have any other choice.'

1070
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:30,065
'I'll need money to
survive until I'm alive.'

1071
01:00:31,141 --> 01:00:32,802
'And all I have is my boxing.'

1072
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,068
'I'm a good boxer.'

1073
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:37,707
'Lf I win this fight... '

1074
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:40,443
'... I can get the job
of a coach in any club.'

1075
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:45,148
'Lt's the only chance I have left.'

1076
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:06,036
I have good contacts in this city.

1077
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:11,739
I can get you a job somewhere.
- Thanks.

1078
01:01:15,919 --> 01:01:20,015
Is Ali right here?

1079
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:24,386
He's standing right
in front of you.

1080
01:02:22,485 --> 01:02:23,543
Gehna.

1081
01:02:23,953 --> 01:02:27,821
Gehna, I've experienced divinity.

1082
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:30,821
You can't imagine what I saw.

1083
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:32,828
I saw that light.

1084
01:02:33,897 --> 01:02:36,263
I saw the light that
people see when they die.

1085
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:41,228
That's what I keep trying to tell
you, that I can see dead people.

1086
01:02:41,304 --> 01:02:43,204
I can actually see them.
- 'Gehna.'

1087
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,831
'Arman is suffering
form Schizophrenia.'

1088
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:51,844
'And the... imaginary
world that he has created... '

1089
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:54,975
'... in that, he's helping people.'

1090
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:58,850
'Actually, all this is in his mind.'

1091
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:01,381
'Lt's just his imagination.'

1092
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:06,262
'The truth is that
he is that child.'

1093
01:03:06,863 --> 01:03:11,232
'And he sees the father that
he still needs in Kapoor.'

1094
01:03:11,935 --> 01:03:14,096
'And he can see his
mother in Carol.'

1095
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:19,133
'You see, it's his
perfect family.'

1096
01:03:20,877 --> 01:03:22,538
'Something has happened
in his life.'

1097
01:03:24,013 --> 01:03:25,878
'There's something
that he's trying to hide.'

1098
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:30,410
'From everyone. From himself.'

1099
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:36,882
'I'm scared, if Arman finds
solace in his imaginary world... '

1100
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,954
'... then it'll be difficult
to get him back in our world.'

1101
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:46,309
Mr. Kapoor.

1102
01:03:47,454 --> 01:03:48,751
What happens after we die?

1103
01:03:50,256 --> 01:03:51,416
Why do you want to know?

1104
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:56,459
It's very difficult to explain.

1105
01:03:59,132 --> 01:04:01,396
But it's a very unusual experience.

1106
01:04:04,738 --> 01:04:07,138
It seems like a
person is leaving behind...

1107
01:04:07,207 --> 01:04:11,143
...all the worries and
problems of this world...

1108
01:04:11,211 --> 01:04:12,769
...and entering another world.

1109
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:16,547
There is no physical pain,
that's gone.

1110
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:21,211
You can see a light.

1111
01:04:21,287 --> 01:04:24,154
And some people can
see their entire life...

1112
01:04:24,224 --> 01:04:27,625
...while reaching that light.

1113
01:04:27,694 --> 01:04:28,888
Like a flashback.

1114
01:04:32,165 --> 01:04:36,158
And some people
advance towards that light...

1115
01:04:36,236 --> 01:04:38,431
...through a very beautiful path.

1116
01:04:39,706 --> 01:04:43,403
Like... like someone
is calling them.

1117
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:47,237
Sounds beautiful.

1118
01:04:50,784 --> 01:04:51,842
It is beautiful.

1119
01:05:11,204 --> 01:05:12,603
Why are you going to Mrs. Mehra?

1120
01:05:13,339 --> 01:05:15,273
Just because her husband is dead.

1121
01:05:16,476 --> 01:05:18,944
Are you feeling bored amongst us?

1122
01:05:20,547 --> 01:05:22,879
Mom, if it's something
like that, then let me know.

1123
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:26,407
I can fix you up in
Jude Cross old age home.

1124
01:05:27,487 --> 01:05:28,954
Mr. Sinha's wife is there as well.

1125
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:30,381
You know her.

1126
01:05:31,424 --> 01:05:35,417
I think that will be
best for all of us.

1127
01:05:35,895 --> 01:05:36,953
Alright.

1128
01:05:37,764 --> 01:05:38,822
Mom, are you listening to me?

1129
01:05:38,898 --> 01:05:40,422
Come on, darling,
we're getting late.

1130
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,229
Daddy, we're getting late.

1131
01:05:42,302 --> 01:05:43,360
Yes.

1132
01:05:44,237 --> 01:05:45,295
All I get is one Sunday.

1133
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,306
Can't you look after
the house one day?

1134
01:05:48,575 --> 01:05:49,701
I don't have time for this now.

1135
01:05:50,577 --> 01:05:52,340
I'll come back and
talk to you, alright?

1136
01:06:17,937 --> 01:06:19,666
I made a big mistake, Arman.

1137
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:23,940
Wealth can change a
person so drastically.

1138
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,271
I was about to transfer
everything in Puja's name...

1139
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:30,407
...but she stopped me.

1140
01:06:32,685 --> 01:06:34,277
I have to rectify my mistake.

1141
01:06:37,957 --> 01:06:39,288
It's not about money, Arman...

1142
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,692
...it's about power which
I bestowed in the wrong hands.

1143
01:06:46,566 --> 01:06:49,364
If I rectify my mistake,
then maybe...

1144
01:06:52,906 --> 01:06:54,567
Maybe, Aadi will reform as well.

1145
01:06:59,379 --> 01:07:01,370
I never made Puja cry.

1146
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:04,708
Never.

1147
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,388
And I promised that,
whether I'm there or not...

1148
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:11,821
...she'll always be happy.

1149
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:18,592
And I broke my promise.

1150
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:37,078
Arman, please, help me.

1151
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:54,090
Yes, nice.

1152
01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:58,428
Hold that.

1153
01:07:58,838 --> 01:07:59,896
Nice.

1154
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,442
I think we're done for
the day. Thank you, ladies.

1155
01:08:05,845 --> 01:08:06,903
Okay.

1156
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:09,439
It's a wrap.

1157
01:08:11,985 --> 01:08:14,385
Does it take so long
to return a phone call?

1158
01:08:14,454 --> 01:08:16,388
At least, I called back, unlike you.

1159
01:08:16,456 --> 01:08:17,548
And you called after so long.

1160
01:08:17,924 --> 01:08:19,050
You must have called for a favour.

1161
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:20,456
Of course, I called for a favour.

1162
01:08:20,526 --> 01:08:22,050
Listen, I'm searching for a child.

1163
01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:24,726
Why? Are you planning to adopt him?

1164
01:08:24,998 --> 01:08:26,659
You shouldn't be that lazy.

1165
01:08:26,733 --> 01:08:27,791
Just shut up and listen.

1166
01:08:28,134 --> 01:08:30,398
The boy's name is Daniel Fernandez...

1167
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,462
...the mother's name is Carol
Marie Fernandez who is dead.

1168
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:35,006
I want to know where the boy is.

1169
01:08:35,074 --> 01:08:36,132
I think they're from Goa.

1170
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:38,877
When did she die?
- I don't know.

1171
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:41,470
Any photograph?
- No, nothing.

1172
01:08:41,614 --> 01:08:45,141
All I know is that the
lady was 28 years old.

1173
01:08:45,618 --> 01:08:47,415
The child is 3 to 4 years old.

1174
01:08:47,954 --> 01:08:49,012
That's all I know.

1175
01:08:49,088 --> 01:08:53,149
Fine, Arman, I'll check the
records of the last five years.

1176
01:08:53,426 --> 01:08:55,087
Okay.
- Okay. Thanks, Arjun, thanks.

1177
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:01,160
Hey Mary, you are looking beautiful.
Look let's go for coffee... - Shut it.

1178
01:09:01,434 --> 01:09:02,492
What do you want now?

1179
01:09:02,568 --> 01:09:04,433
I feel that this world is going...

1180
01:09:04,504 --> 01:09:07,439
...to give examples of our friendship.
- Yes, right.

1181
01:09:07,507 --> 01:09:09,975
The day you become a
girl and I'll marry you.

1182
01:09:10,176 --> 01:09:13,168
What's the matter
- Kapoor, the dead man... - Yes.

1183
01:09:13,446 --> 01:09:15,846
I need to help him. I need your help.
- What do you have to do?

1184
01:09:16,449 --> 01:09:17,507
Nothing much.

1185
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:18,982
You just have to loot a bank.
- What?

1186
01:09:19,786 --> 01:09:20,844
What can I do for you, sir?

1187
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,186
You can get me somebody in...

1188
01:09:25,725 --> 01:09:26,783
In charge.

1189
01:09:26,859 --> 01:09:28,884
Somebody in charge.
- Yes, somebody in charge.

1190
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,724
And who should I say is here?

1191
01:09:32,065 --> 01:09:35,933
Mr. Virender Kapoor.
- Yes, that's my name.

1192
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:38,528
What? Virender Kapoor.

1193
01:09:41,074 --> 01:09:42,132
But he's...

1194
01:09:43,543 --> 01:09:44,874
Let me check.
- Sure.

1195
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:46,536
Stand like the rich.

1196
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:47,670
Confident.

1197
01:09:48,481 --> 01:09:49,948
I'm scared.
- No, relax.

1198
01:09:50,016 --> 01:09:51,881
Mr. Kapoor.
- Yes.

1199
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:54,976
You're alive.

1200
01:09:55,488 --> 01:09:56,546
He's alive.

1201
01:09:56,889 --> 01:09:58,151
Are you asking or telling me?

1202
01:09:58,224 --> 01:10:01,557
No, no, actually, I didn't
see you for a long time.

1203
01:10:01,627 --> 01:10:05,563
And there were...
some rumours about you.

1204
01:10:05,898 --> 01:10:06,956
Rumours?

1205
01:10:07,033 --> 01:10:08,830
Chest out. Stomach in.

1206
01:10:09,702 --> 01:10:10,760
Sir

1207
01:10:11,504 --> 01:10:13,495
There was a bank scam in 2005...

1208
01:10:13,573 --> 01:10:15,700
...in which he was the prime suspect.

1209
01:10:15,775 --> 01:10:17,834
One percent from every
account went missing.

1210
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:18,968
Hit him with that.

1211
01:10:19,045 --> 01:10:21,036
Which rumours?
- The one...

1212
01:10:21,114 --> 01:10:22,581
The one in 2005.

1213
01:10:23,516 --> 01:10:24,574
Scam.

1214
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:26,049
You were in the
suspects list as well.

1215
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,681
Why are you digging up old news?

1216
01:10:30,022 --> 01:10:31,512
By the way...

1217
01:10:31,591 --> 01:10:35,186
By the way, Mr.
Kapoor, you seemed taller.

1218
01:10:35,928 --> 01:10:37,862
First, you called me dead.
Now, you're calling me short.

1219
01:10:38,264 --> 01:10:40,596
Where's the account closing counter?
- No, no.

1220
01:10:40,867 --> 01:10:42,266
What are you saying?

1221
01:10:42,535 --> 01:10:44,594
Please tell me, sir.
How can I help you?

1222
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,194
That's the first right question.

1223
01:10:47,006 --> 01:10:49,201
I want to check my locker.

1224
01:10:49,742 --> 01:10:50,800
Locker.

1225
01:10:50,877 --> 01:10:51,935
Locker.

1226
01:10:52,545 --> 01:10:53,603
Come with me.
- This way.

1227
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:54,976
Come...
- Don't touch her.

1228
01:10:56,949 --> 01:11:01,613
Mr. Kapoor, actually,
I'm seeing you...

1229
01:11:01,687 --> 01:11:02,745
There were some family problems.

1230
01:11:02,822 --> 01:11:05,222
Actually... I used to wait...

1231
01:11:05,892 --> 01:11:11,159
We sent you so many e-mails,
but you didn't reply to any.

1232
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,288
I was out.

1233
01:11:15,101 --> 01:11:17,626
You just disappeared suddenly.

1234
01:11:18,104 --> 01:11:19,162
You didn't even inform us.

1235
01:11:22,108 --> 01:11:23,575
Are you my wife...

1236
01:11:23,643 --> 01:11:25,634
...that I've to inform
you before going anywhere?

1237
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:27,636
Why aren't you talking to me?

1238
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:29,639
Locker.

1239
01:11:30,116 --> 01:11:31,913
Open the locker.
- Locker.

1240
01:11:32,652 --> 01:11:33,710
Locker.

1241
01:11:33,786 --> 01:11:34,844
This way, sir.

1242
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:38,152
Please. Come. Open it.

1243
01:11:38,724 --> 01:11:40,191
My blood pressure is rising.

1244
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,926
What is your number?

1245
01:11:49,335 --> 01:11:50,927
Five. Would you like
it on your cheeks?

1246
01:11:52,605 --> 01:11:54,869
You must remember your...
10 digit code.

1247
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:56,607
Key it in.

1248
01:11:56,676 --> 01:11:57,734
Yes.

1249
01:12:00,346 --> 01:12:01,608
One.
- What?

1250
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:02,739
One.
- What?

1251
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:09,983
Yes...
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1252
01:12:11,224 --> 01:12:13,158
Seven, eight, nine, zero.
- How do you know?

1253
01:12:13,626 --> 01:12:14,684
Guess.

1254
01:12:16,963 --> 01:12:18,021
Silly man.

1255
01:12:20,099 --> 01:12:21,225
This is easier than I thought.

1256
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:22,893
I can do this more often.

1257
01:12:22,969 --> 01:12:24,732
The skirt is really tight.
I feel like taking it off.

1258
01:12:25,638 --> 01:12:27,629
Sorry, Uncle...
- Uncle, my...

1259
01:12:28,641 --> 01:12:29,699
Its okay, son.
- Relax.

1260
01:12:30,977 --> 01:12:33,104
Hi, I called last
week to open an account.

1261
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:34,237
My name is Aditya Kapoor.

1262
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:36,076
Sir, how was the experience?

1263
01:12:36,983 --> 01:12:38,041
Great.
- Great.

1264
01:12:38,718 --> 01:12:40,709
Can I be of further assistance, sir?

1265
01:12:40,786 --> 01:12:41,844
Transfer my company's bank account...

1266
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:43,320
...in the name of my wife.

1267
01:12:43,389 --> 01:12:44,651
Transfer my company's bank account...

1268
01:12:44,724 --> 01:12:45,782
...in the name of my wife.

1269
01:12:45,858 --> 01:12:48,326
Oh, sure. I'll get the
transfer papers right away.

1270
01:12:51,664 --> 01:12:52,926
Good.
- My foot.

1271
01:12:52,999 --> 01:12:54,398
Now that scoundrel
will learn a lesson.

1272
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:57,095
Tell her that she can
abuse my son and not me.

1273
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:58,932
Don't abuse you.
- Why shouldn't I?

1274
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:02,099
He won't learn his lesson, until
he isn't thrown on the streets.

1275
01:13:02,174 --> 01:13:04,005
We'll be thrown in
the prison before that.

1276
01:13:04,677 --> 01:13:06,804
There'll be verifications.
I'll have to sign.

1277
01:13:06,879 --> 01:13:08,847
I've gone crazy that
I'm helping ghosts.

1278
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:10,406
Let's run away.

1279
01:13:10,683 --> 01:13:12,776
You coward, is that
all the guts you have?

1280
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:14,683
I haven't robbed
bank for a long time...

1281
01:13:14,754 --> 01:13:16,085
...so, I've lost touch.

1282
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:17,747
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1283
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:20,757
Who is that man?
- Him.

1284
01:13:20,826 --> 01:13:23,021
Yes.
- That's Mr. Virender Kapoor.

1285
01:13:23,095 --> 01:13:24,756
A very old client of our bank.

1286
01:13:24,964 --> 01:13:26,022
What a coincidence!

1287
01:13:26,098 --> 01:13:28,760
My father's name is
Virender Kapoor as well. - Really?

1288
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:31,701
Don't tell me that
his company's name is...

1289
01:13:31,771 --> 01:13:33,705
...Dexico Traders...
- Dexico Traders.

1290
01:13:33,773 --> 01:13:35,104
Yes.
- How right you are, sir!

1291
01:13:35,174 --> 01:13:36,232
Of course, it is.

1292
01:13:39,111 --> 01:13:40,169
But that's impossible.

1293
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,040
You'll be absolutely fine.
Just sign and let's go.

1294
01:13:42,114 --> 01:13:44,776
Sign. - Yes, sir, here
are the transfer papers.

1295
01:13:45,251 --> 01:13:47,776
Just sign in the places
I've marked with a cross.

1296
01:13:47,853 --> 01:13:49,787
We'll take care of the rest, okay?

1297
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:51,789
I don't have a pen, I can't sign.

1298
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:53,449
Pen. Here.

1299
01:13:53,726 --> 01:13:56,456
You have a pen as well.
- I have everything.

1300
01:13:57,463 --> 01:13:59,124
Mini, are you feeling hot?
- Hot.

1301
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:00,256
I'm feeling very hot.

1302
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:02,062
It's so hot.
- The AVC...

1303
01:14:02,134 --> 01:14:03,931
How will I sign?
- Just do it.

1304
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:11,136
I'm dead. - I'm in a fix
and you're cracking jokes.

1305
01:14:11,944 --> 01:14:13,809
That man coming this way, is my son.

1306
01:14:17,216 --> 01:14:19,946
But there's no problem,
he doesn't know me.

1307
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:21,816
But he does know his father.

1308
01:14:22,355 --> 01:14:23,413
Do something.

1309
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:24,751
Do something, please.

1310
01:14:24,824 --> 01:14:25,882
Arman, I love you.

1311
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,755
I can't help you in this situation.

1312
01:14:27,827 --> 01:14:28,885
Come on...

1313
01:14:33,032 --> 01:14:34,090
Excuse me.

1314
01:14:38,237 --> 01:14:42,105
You. Useless, betrayer,
you followed me here too.

1315
01:14:42,174 --> 01:14:45,371
How many times have I told
you that I'm not your father?

1316
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:46,775
That's what I'm saying,
you're not my father...

1317
01:14:46,846 --> 01:14:48,780
Don't call me dad.

1318
01:14:48,848 --> 01:14:49,906
Don't you dare.

1319
01:14:49,982 --> 01:14:51,973
I'm dead for you and
I'm dead for you.

1320
01:14:52,051 --> 01:14:54,042
Get out of my sight, you rascal.

1321
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,117
Not bad, Arman.
- Thank you.

1322
01:14:56,188 --> 01:14:58,452
Sir, don't...
- What crap are you talking?

1323
01:14:58,524 --> 01:14:59,786
He can't be my father.

1324
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:02,453
I'm not his father. - It often
happens between a father and son...

1325
01:15:02,528 --> 01:15:03,790
What nonsense!

1326
01:15:03,863 --> 01:15:06,889
My father is dead.
- And you're dead for me, rascal.

1327
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:08,327
Sir, what are you saying?

1328
01:15:08,401 --> 01:15:09,459
I'm absolutely right.

1329
01:15:09,535 --> 01:15:11,799
Apologise to your father.
- But he's not my dad.

1330
01:15:11,871 --> 01:15:13,862
Yes, and he's not my son.

1331
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,205
You were inquiring
about my personal problem.

1332
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:17,867
He's my personal problem.

1333
01:15:18,077 --> 01:15:19,135
I got personal with my wife...

1334
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:20,337
...and created this problem.

1335
01:15:20,813 --> 01:15:21,871
Monica.

1336
01:15:22,014 --> 01:15:23,481
Are you going to take a bath?

1337
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:28,884
I have to look for a bank to
cash in 10 million dollars.

1338
01:15:29,088 --> 01:15:30,419
Whom are you trying to fool?

1339
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:31,881
Call the security.

1340
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:34,824
Call the security!

1341
01:15:34,894 --> 01:15:35,952
Sir, our bank will
incur heavy losses...

1342
01:15:36,028 --> 01:15:37,495
...because of your personal quarrels.

1343
01:15:37,563 --> 01:15:38,825
Don't do this, please.

1344
01:15:38,898 --> 01:15:43,028
I'm leaving because there
can't be two Kapoor's in one bank.

1345
01:15:43,102 --> 01:15:45,570
Who the hell are you?
- Insolent.

1346
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:47,430
Is that the way to
talk to your father?

1347
01:15:47,907 --> 01:15:49,101
Security.
- Call the security.

1348
01:15:49,442 --> 01:15:53,503
Take him away!
He's going to kill me!

1349
01:15:53,979 --> 01:15:55,970
I'll have a heart attack.
- Are you okay, sir?

1350
01:15:56,449 --> 01:15:59,441
I need air. I need fresh air.
- Sir, can I...

1351
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:00,917
Please, don't come any closer.

1352
01:16:00,986 --> 01:16:02,453
Just leave me alone.

1353
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:06,252
How will I sign?

1354
01:16:06,325 --> 01:16:07,383
By the way, are you married?
- Idiot.

1355
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:11,195
Kapoor, you got me in this.
- Not a problem. - Yes.

1356
01:16:11,263 --> 01:16:12,855
Virender's V.
- Virender's V.

1357
01:16:12,932 --> 01:16:15,867
Kapoor's K.
- Kapoor's K. V... K... What?

1358
01:16:15,935 --> 01:16:16,993
Sorry, Arman.

1359
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:19,328
Here we go, sir.
- He's fine.

1360
01:16:19,872 --> 01:16:21,931
Sleazy man. Here.

1361
01:16:22,274 --> 01:16:25,937
Virender Kapoor, here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

1362
01:16:26,011 --> 01:16:27,069
Right on.

1363
01:16:27,146 --> 01:16:28,204
Good boy

1364
01:16:29,882 --> 01:16:30,940
Let's go.

1365
01:16:31,016 --> 01:16:33,951
I hate it, I hate it.
- I didn't do anything, sir.

1366
01:16:34,019 --> 01:16:35,077
Sick.

1367
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:36,212
I feel disgusted.

1368
01:16:37,556 --> 01:16:38,955
You are overacting.

1369
01:16:39,024 --> 01:16:40,082
I'm sorry.

1370
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:41,217
I'm sorry, sir.

1371
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:43,225
I just tried.

1372
01:16:49,034 --> 01:16:51,366
I'm afraid. Sir, madam out of home.

1373
01:16:51,437 --> 01:16:53,302
No, I want to see Mrs. Kapoor.

1374
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:56,306
Would you like to wait in
the study while I call her?

1375
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:57,633
Thank you, thank you.

1376
01:16:58,577 --> 01:17:00,101
Never seen this guy before.

1377
01:17:01,914 --> 01:17:04,974
My name is Arman Suri and...

1378
01:17:06,352 --> 01:17:08,650
Your husband Mr. Virender Kapoor...

1379
01:17:09,588 --> 01:17:11,317
...I meet him quite often.

1380
01:17:12,324 --> 01:17:13,382
In fact, you won't believe it...

1381
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:14,983
...just yesterday, we
robbed a bank together.

1382
01:17:16,328 --> 01:17:17,386
And I'm not mad.

1383
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:18,588
I swear I'm not lying.

1384
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:19,989
Flee off.

1385
01:17:20,065 --> 01:17:21,123
If I catch you here again...

1386
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,668
...you will be the grass
and I'll be the lawn mower.

1387
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:26,598
I hope you got that loud and clear.

1388
01:17:27,106 --> 01:17:28,664
Now, off with you.

1389
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:34,036
I did as far as I could.

1390
01:17:34,547 --> 01:17:35,946
Here's the money. Go
give it to her yourself.

1391
01:17:36,015 --> 01:17:37,073
Arman, it isn't that difficult.

1392
01:17:37,149 --> 01:17:38,411
Arman, Arman, please.
- It isn't that difficult.

1393
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:40,213
The car is this way.
- I know.

1394
01:17:42,288 --> 01:17:43,482
Just... leave me alone.

1395
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:46,015
Arman. Please, Arman.

1396
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:55,161
And for the first time in my life,
I've been thrown out of a house.

1397
01:17:56,302 --> 01:17:58,236
Just... just don't...

1398
01:17:58,304 --> 01:18:00,033
Why should I say a poem?
You say it.

1399
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,171
Once more, with feelings.

1400
01:18:11,183 --> 01:18:17,053
I want to... - I want to
immerse in your innate eyes.

1401
01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:18,714
But what to do.
- What?

1402
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,517
Just say it.

1403
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:24,656
But what to do.
- I can swim.

1404
01:18:25,664 --> 01:18:28,132
'I want to lose
myself in your tresses.'

1405
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:33,160
'But what to do, my sense of
direction is perfect. - I know.'

1406
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:35,002
'Pause. Pause. Just a minute.'

1407
01:18:35,074 --> 01:18:36,132
'Mrs. Brown.'

1408
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:38,073
'Mrs. Brown.
- Yes, sir.'

1409
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:39,468
'For the kids.'

1410
01:18:40,546 --> 01:18:41,604
'Okay.
- Sure.'

1411
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,072
'Please continue.'

1412
01:18:46,552 --> 01:18:48,679
'I want to spend
every moment with you.'

1413
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:54,748
'But what to do, I've to
take care of business as well.'

1414
01:18:55,427 --> 01:18:56,485
'What to do.'

1415
01:19:01,767 --> 01:19:03,701
'Hi, mom. Hi, dad.
- Hey, Aadi.'

1416
01:19:05,437 --> 01:19:07,098
'Here you go, Buddy.'
- Yeah.

1417
01:19:07,172 --> 01:19:09,037
'Office on Sunday.
- Sorry, Dad... '

1418
01:19:09,108 --> 01:19:10,336
'... l'll be right back
after I deal with a meeting.'

1419
01:19:10,409 --> 01:19:12,104
'Here, have a bite.
- Okay.'

1420
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:14,376
'Mom, dad, I've to go.'

1421
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:16,571
'Don't be late.
- No, I won't.'

1422
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:18,175
'Bye.
- Bye. Bye, see you later.'

1423
01:19:23,389 --> 01:19:25,789
'Puja, can I say something? '

1424
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:29,057
'Even if something happens to me... '

1425
01:19:29,128 --> 01:19:33,121
'... he will look after you.
- You've started again.'

1426
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:34,256
'What to do.'

1427
01:19:36,135 --> 01:19:37,261
Once more, from the beginning.

1428
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:40,800
I haven't said such a
disgusting poem in my life.

1429
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:43,069
Keep saying it, or else,
I'll enter your body...

1430
01:19:43,142 --> 01:19:45,736
...take off all your clothes
and dance outside Gehna's house.

1431
01:19:48,614 --> 01:19:51,276
I want to lose myself
in your tresses.

1432
01:19:52,084 --> 01:19:53,574
I want to loose
myself in your tresses.

1433
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:55,277
But what to do

1434
01:19:55,354 --> 01:19:56,412
But what to do.

1435
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:59,080
My sense of direction is perfect.

1436
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:02,226
My sense of direction...
- Hey you, come in.

1437
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:09,225
Thanks.

1438
01:20:16,108 --> 01:20:20,169
How is he?
- He's fine.

1439
01:20:25,584 --> 01:20:29,577
I wish... I could touch him once.

1440
01:21:10,295 --> 01:21:11,353
Puja.

1441
01:21:40,392 --> 01:21:41,586
What has happened to you?

1442
01:21:44,863 --> 01:21:47,263
I only wanted to see you happy.

1443
01:21:52,404 --> 01:21:54,304
I miss you a lot, Puja.

1444
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:59,867
And I'm waiting for you.

1445
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:06,942
But don't you dare be
in a haste to meet me.

1446
01:22:09,221 --> 01:22:10,654
I don't miss you that much.

1447
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:25,897
I want you to live
your life to the fullest.

1448
01:22:32,311 --> 01:22:33,835
And my part of life too.

1449
01:22:38,851 --> 01:22:42,446
I'll always love you, Puja.
- Me too.

1450
01:23:19,691 --> 01:23:20,749
Thank you, Arman.

1451
01:23:23,295 --> 01:23:24,387
Will you be a good boy?

1452
01:23:27,432 --> 01:23:29,627
Or else, you know what I can do.

1453
01:23:34,907 --> 01:23:36,374
Do you have to go?

1454
01:23:39,678 --> 01:23:40,736
What to do.

1455
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,809
'Sometimes, I forget I'm dead.'

1456
01:24:21,954 --> 01:24:24,684
'I'm dead, I can't be any calmer.'

1457
01:24:24,756 --> 01:24:26,087
'Should I do deep breathing? '

1458
01:24:27,559 --> 01:24:30,426
'You're the host, we,
the ghost, remember.'

1459
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:35,431
Everywhere you go.

1460
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:37,098
You have a third class car.

1461
01:24:38,036 --> 01:24:40,436
Youthful and beautiful beloved.

1462
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:47,103
'I want to... - I want to
immerse in your innate eyes.'

1463
01:24:47,779 --> 01:24:49,610
'But what to do.
- What? '

1464
01:24:52,384 --> 01:24:53,442
'Do you have to go? '

1465
01:24:56,855 --> 01:24:57,913
'What to do.'

1466
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:09,465
But Arman's illness has advanced.

1467
01:25:10,769 --> 01:25:12,498
We'll have to admit
him in the hospital.

1468
01:25:13,672 --> 01:25:14,730
Immediately.

1469
01:25:15,941 --> 01:25:17,875
And I don't think anyone
else can make him agree.

1470
01:25:20,012 --> 01:25:25,143
As time passes, this
illness will get out of control

1471
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,746
I don't want to lose him.

1472
01:25:31,957 --> 01:25:34,152
Seventies. Come on, yes.

1473
01:25:35,761 --> 01:25:36,819
Yes. Good.

1474
01:25:39,564 --> 01:25:41,964
Hold that. Hold that. Yes. Yes.

1475
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:47,632
Nice. Good.

1476
01:25:47,706 --> 01:25:49,173
Come on, attitude.
- Good.

1477
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:56,977
Out, out.
- What happened?

1478
01:25:57,049 --> 01:25:59,176
No, no, not you. You come inside.

1479
01:26:01,053 --> 01:26:03,521
You're in my frame.
- What difference does it make?

1480
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,986
Is something wrong with him again?
- Fine.

1481
01:26:06,725 --> 01:26:08,590
What is it? Who is it?
- Carol.

1482
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,185
Where is she? - She's
trotting in front of the frame.

1483
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,121
What's going on?
- I don't know.

1484
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,062
Come on, girls, let's shoot.

1485
01:26:16,468 --> 01:26:18,060
Seventies, rock-n-roll.

1486
01:26:21,073 --> 01:26:22,199
I want you to hold that, hold that.

1487
01:26:23,008 --> 01:26:25,067
Nice, good. Yeah.

1488
01:26:26,478 --> 01:26:27,536
Seventies.

1489
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,538
Good.

1490
01:26:33,085 --> 01:26:34,143
Mini.

1491
01:26:35,087 --> 01:26:37,487
The dresses which the girls in
the middle are wearing. - Yes.

1492
01:26:38,223 --> 01:26:41,215
Is that still in?
- No, it's a typical 70's look.

1493
01:26:42,027 --> 01:26:43,892
Remember, Neetu Singh and the
others used to wear it in movies.

1494
01:26:43,962 --> 01:26:45,862
Bellbottoms, full dress.
- Why?

1495
01:26:47,999 --> 01:26:49,057
Just...

1496
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,506
Carol, when did you die exactly?
- I told you.

1497
01:26:57,776 --> 01:26:58,834
You didn't.

1498
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:00,775
Impossible, I'm sure I told you.

1499
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:02,609
I said you didn't tell me.

1500
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:03,909
Fine, tell me again.

1501
01:27:04,516 --> 01:27:08,247
9th of September, 1975.
- What?

1502
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:11,921
You didn't like the date,
should I change it?

1503
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:15,023
You don't regret your
death one bit, do you?

1504
01:27:16,261 --> 01:27:18,058
Should I keep regretting
for 30 years.

1505
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:21,192
I want to live my life too.

1506
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:25,594
What?
- Fine, live my death. - What?

1507
01:27:26,071 --> 01:27:27,129
Die my death.

1508
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:28,597
Whatever.

1509
01:27:35,547 --> 01:27:36,605
Yes, Arman.

1510
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:38,615
Carol Fernandez, the one
I told you about. - Yes.

1511
01:27:38,683 --> 01:27:42,278
She died on 9th September,
1975, in Goa.

1512
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:46,016
Sms me all the details,
I'll take a look tomorrow.

1513
01:27:46,224 --> 01:27:47,282
Thanks buddy.

1514
01:27:48,093 --> 01:27:49,151
How's everything else?

1515
01:27:49,294 --> 01:27:51,694
Shut up, Arman, its
two o'clock in the night.

1516
01:27:51,763 --> 01:27:52,821
Sorry, goodnight.

1517
01:27:54,766 --> 01:27:57,963
You want to know,
don't you... how I died?

1518
01:27:59,771 --> 01:28:01,238
The last day of my life.

1519
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:07,237
I went to Mumbai for a seminar,
which ended a day earlier.

1520
01:28:08,713 --> 01:28:09,907
I didn't tell Mike.

1521
01:28:10,715 --> 01:28:12,182
I thought of surprising him.

1522
01:28:13,585 --> 01:28:14,643
But.

1523
01:28:26,198 --> 01:28:27,256
'What's going on? '

1524
01:28:27,332 --> 01:28:29,664
Nothing. Carol.
- Oh, my God.'

1525
01:28:30,135 --> 01:28:31,193
'Who is she? '

1526
01:28:31,269 --> 01:28:33,931
'No on, Carol, she's just...
- Get out.'

1527
01:28:34,005 --> 01:28:35,734
'Carol, please.
- Don't touch me.'

1528
01:28:35,807 --> 01:28:37,798
'Carol...
- You get out, get out.'

1529
01:28:37,876 --> 01:28:39,673
'Listen to me, Carol.
- Don't touch me.'

1530
01:28:39,744 --> 01:28:40,802
'Carol, Danny will wake up.'

1531
01:28:40,879 --> 01:28:42,141
'Don't touch me, you cheater.'

1532
01:28:42,214 --> 01:28:43,704
'I will kill you.
- For Gods sake, Carol... '

1533
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:52,681
'Oh my God.'

1534
01:28:53,358 --> 01:28:54,723
'Carol. Carol.'
- Oh God.

1535
01:28:55,961 --> 01:28:58,020
'Please take Danny inside.'
- Come on, son.

1536
01:29:18,383 --> 01:29:19,850
I was in coma for two weeks.

1537
01:29:22,387 --> 01:29:25,652
And no one knew
where Mike took Danny...

1538
01:29:25,724 --> 01:29:29,990
...in these two weeks.

1539
01:29:31,863 --> 01:29:33,922
And the police?
- Police.

1540
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:38,063
According to the
police it was an accident.

1541
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:40,728
That was what the
evidences were indicating.

1542
01:29:44,409 --> 01:29:48,675
I just want to meet my son once.

1543
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:56,416
I want to tell him...
that I never left him.

1544
01:29:58,089 --> 01:30:02,423
I just... want to see him once.

1545
01:30:10,035 --> 01:30:11,696
Carol's husband killed her.

1546
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,431
I mean, it wasn't an
accident but a murder.

1547
01:30:14,306 --> 01:30:15,364
To cover it up...

1548
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,772
...he forced sleeping pills
and alcohol into her mouth.

1549
01:30:18,176 --> 01:30:20,371
And made it look like a suicide.

1550
01:30:21,313 --> 01:30:22,439
What kind of people are they?

1551
01:30:23,848 --> 01:30:25,042
What kind of
a world are we living in?

1552
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:27,783
No importance for relations.

1553
01:30:27,986 --> 01:30:29,214
No value for humans.

1554
01:30:31,456 --> 01:30:34,789
I hate this, Gehna, I hate it.
- Don't worry.

1555
01:30:37,062 --> 01:30:38,120
Everything will be fine.

1556
01:30:39,731 --> 01:30:40,789
I'm there.

1557
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:49,202
Gehna, I love you.
- I love you too.

1558
01:30:51,242 --> 01:30:54,177
We'll go to the hospital?
- Why the hospital?

1559
01:30:57,816 --> 01:30:59,306
Because you need treatment.

1560
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:03,016
What?
- I talked to the doctor, Arman.

1561
01:31:07,826 --> 01:31:09,157
You think I'm lying.

1562
01:31:09,761 --> 01:31:10,819
I'm hallucinating?
- That's not it, Arman.

1563
01:31:11,229 --> 01:31:12,821
Then what is it?

1564
01:31:13,765 --> 01:31:17,826
You think I'm nuts.
- I want to help you.

1565
01:31:17,902 --> 01:31:19,164
Then help me.

1566
01:31:19,971 --> 01:31:21,495
That woman is searching
for her child.

1567
01:31:21,973 --> 01:31:23,440
Help me find that child.

1568
01:31:23,508 --> 01:31:24,770
Can you do that?

1569
01:31:26,044 --> 01:31:27,102
Nonsense!

1570
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:31,778
Arman, do you love me?

1571
01:31:34,386 --> 01:31:38,049
Gehna, you don't understand.
- You don't understand, Arman.

1572
01:31:41,393 --> 01:31:43,054
Arman, I love you.

1573
01:31:44,195 --> 01:31:45,253
I love you.

1574
01:31:47,465 --> 01:31:49,933
I want to spend my
entire life with you.

1575
01:31:52,804 --> 01:31:55,796
If that's what you want...
then please...

1576
01:31:55,874 --> 01:31:57,865
...come with me to
the hospital tomorrow.

1577
01:31:59,077 --> 01:32:00,135
Please.

1578
01:32:01,813 --> 01:32:02,871
Arman.

1579
01:32:05,817 --> 01:32:06,875
What if I don't?

1580
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:19,488
Then I'm sorry.

1581
01:32:23,368 --> 01:32:24,426
Darn! Oh no!

1582
01:32:25,837 --> 01:32:28,567
We were together.

1583
01:32:29,107 --> 01:32:37,014
But why are we separate now?

1584
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:44,855
Tell me what shall...

1585
01:32:44,923 --> 01:32:50,953
...I tell the solitude?

1586
01:32:51,262 --> 01:32:57,258
I don't know what
you didn't believe me.

1587
01:32:57,869 --> 01:33:03,933
It must be something
lacking in me.

1588
01:33:04,008 --> 01:33:09,207
Hear me, my sweetheart.

1589
01:33:10,415 --> 01:33:17,287
You belong to me,
and I belong to you.

1590
01:33:26,431 --> 01:33:35,965
I don't know why you
didn't understand my pain.

1591
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:43,913
I don't know why I was lonely...

1592
01:33:43,982 --> 01:33:50,444
...even when you were around me.

1593
01:33:52,257 --> 01:33:58,127
I don't know why
you didn't believe me.

1594
01:33:58,596 --> 01:34:04,466
It must be something
lacking in me.

1595
01:34:04,936 --> 01:34:09,999
Hear me, my sweetheart.

1596
01:34:11,276 --> 01:34:18,011
You belong to me,
and I belong to you.

1597
01:34:20,351 --> 01:34:26,620
Explain to me why
I shouldn't say anything.

1598
01:34:26,691 --> 01:34:33,961
Should I stop you or
just watch you fade away?

1599
01:34:34,032 --> 01:34:40,028
What did I say?
What did you hear?

1600
01:34:40,104 --> 01:34:45,474
Try to understand.

1601
01:34:46,377 --> 01:34:52,577
Why have we drifted apart?

1602
01:34:52,650 --> 01:35:00,182
Hear me, my sweetheart.

1603
01:35:01,192 --> 01:35:04,127
Yes, Arjun.
- Carol Fernandez committee suicide.

1604
01:35:04,462 --> 01:35:09,058
And her husband left Goa
along with his four year old son.

1605
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:11,259
I have her address.

1606
01:35:14,072 --> 01:35:15,664
Will you email it to me?
- Yes.

1607
01:35:16,274 --> 01:35:19,209
And, Arjun... thanks buddy.

1608
01:35:20,378 --> 01:35:24,280
Arman, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1609
01:35:26,284 --> 01:35:28,218
Arjun, thanks buddy. Thanks.

1610
01:35:58,349 --> 01:36:01,250
Gehna, please give our
relation another chance.

1611
01:36:03,187 --> 01:36:04,245
I'm going to Goa tomorrow.

1612
01:36:06,057 --> 01:36:07,115
Please come with me.

1613
01:36:10,061 --> 01:36:11,119
Once I'm satisfied...

1614
01:36:11,195 --> 01:36:12,787
...l'm ready to do
anything you want.

1615
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:15,457
You want me to go to
the hospital, don't you?

1616
01:36:15,533 --> 01:36:16,795
I will, I promise you I will go.

1617
01:36:21,739 --> 01:36:23,138
Please give me a chance.

1618
01:36:25,076 --> 01:36:26,134
The flight leaves tomorrow night.

1619
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:31,746
I'll wait for you
at Reagent street.

1620
01:36:32,684 --> 01:36:35,152
Just give me one chance.

1621
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:40,289
Come on, we're getting late.
- Yes.

1622
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,621
I'm sorry, I've to go.

1623
01:37:58,569 --> 01:37:59,900
Thank you for staying with us, sir.

1624
01:38:02,306 --> 01:38:03,364
Good morning, sir.

1625
01:38:03,441 --> 01:38:04,567
Welcome to Radisson, Goa.
- Thank you.

1626
01:38:04,909 --> 01:38:06,706
Can I have your
signature on this form?

1627
01:38:12,417 --> 01:38:14,612
Here you go.
- Sir, your room no is 109.

1628
01:38:14,685 --> 01:38:16,277
My colleague will show
you the way to your room.

1629
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:20,255
Could you help me with
this address please?

1630
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:23,691
This is... just 15
minutes away from here, sir.

1631
01:38:23,795 --> 01:38:24,853
And what about this one?

1632
01:38:25,263 --> 01:38:27,925
Sorry, sir, but a mall has
been constructed in this place.

1633
01:38:28,933 --> 01:38:31,197
But I can give you the
address of the nun...

1634
01:38:31,269 --> 01:38:32,497
...that used to run this nursery.

1635
01:38:32,603 --> 01:38:33,661
Thank you.

1636
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:42,473
Can I help you, sir?
- Hello.

1637
01:38:44,215 --> 01:38:47,207
Did the Fernandez's stay
in this house 30 years ago.

1638
01:38:47,552 --> 01:38:48,917
Fernandez?
- Right.

1639
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:51,217
Sorry, sir, I don't have any idea.

1640
01:38:51,389 --> 01:38:52,447
In fact...

1641
01:39:10,975 --> 01:39:18,381
My dear son, I must have
taught so many children in 30 years.

1642
01:39:20,318 --> 01:39:22,548
There must be so
many Daniel among them.

1643
01:39:23,621 --> 01:39:27,751
No my son. I don't
remember anything more.

1644
01:39:30,528 --> 01:39:34,396
These days, I even forget
what I read in the morning.

1645
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,763
I really wish I could help you.

1646
01:39:39,937 --> 01:39:40,995
I wish too.

1647
01:39:42,874 --> 01:39:47,004
Thank you, thank you for
your time, sister. - Son.

1648
01:39:50,014 --> 01:39:56,886
Do you believe in angels?
- Yes, I do believe in angels.

1649
01:39:56,954 --> 01:39:58,012
Yes, I do.

1650
01:39:58,756 --> 01:40:00,280
Come. Come here.

1651
01:40:04,829 --> 01:40:06,490
This is a guardian angel, my son.

1652
01:40:07,331 --> 01:40:08,696
This will protect you.

1653
01:40:10,034 --> 01:40:11,296
God bless you my son.

1654
01:40:15,406 --> 01:40:16,464
Thank you, sister.

1655
01:40:22,713 --> 01:40:25,682
I'll just...
I'll just go talk to Carol.

1656
01:40:26,551 --> 01:40:27,609
Two minutes.

1657
01:40:33,057 --> 01:40:37,050
Yes, dad. - I was just
missing you so I called.

1658
01:40:37,328 --> 01:40:39,057
Is everything okay?
- Yes, dad.

1659
01:40:40,331 --> 01:40:44,995
Just... once Arman is satisfied,
we'll come back.

1660
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:46,832
Oh, come on, dear.

1661
01:40:47,338 --> 01:40:50,398
Whether Arman is satisfied
or you... that he's fine.

1662
01:40:50,775 --> 01:40:52,333
But he isn't fine, dear.

1663
01:40:53,511 --> 01:40:55,945
I love him, dad,
and he needs my help.

1664
01:40:57,081 --> 01:40:59,481
I just hope you know
what you're doing, dear.

1665
01:41:00,418 --> 01:41:02,352
I don't want you to
realise one day...

1666
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:05,878
...that you wasted your
entire life for a madman.

1667
01:41:06,891 --> 01:41:08,791
Don't worry, dad, I'll be fine.

1668
01:41:09,427 --> 01:41:11,452
I love you.
- I love you too, dear.

1669
01:41:16,701 --> 01:41:18,566
You never told me
anything about yourself.

1670
01:41:21,372 --> 01:41:24,432
No one ever asked. Fine.

1671
01:41:28,646 --> 01:41:35,108
Well, to start with...
my name is Arman. - Yes.

1672
01:41:35,753 --> 01:41:36,811
Okay.

1673
01:41:38,723 --> 01:41:40,748
My mother was
a full time housewife.

1674
01:41:41,058 --> 01:41:42,116
Her name was Suzan,

1675
01:41:42,793 --> 01:41:46,388
My dad's name was Karan, and
he has a real-estate business.

1676
01:41:46,464 --> 01:41:48,125
Had?
- No, but you know...

1677
01:41:49,133 --> 01:41:50,896
They lived happily. Yes.

1678
01:41:52,403 --> 01:41:53,961
They lived happily
and they died happily.

1679
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,130
It's my perfect family.

1680
01:41:58,409 --> 01:41:59,467
My perfect family.

1681
01:42:06,417 --> 01:42:07,475
Arman.

1682
01:42:10,621 --> 01:42:12,418
I can't share you with someone.

1683
01:42:17,161 --> 01:42:23,657
Even if I believe that you
want to help dead people.

1684
01:42:24,435 --> 01:42:25,493
They need you.

1685
01:42:27,905 --> 01:42:31,432
But... I need you as well.

1686
01:42:34,478 --> 01:42:39,177
Arman, they've lived their life.

1687
01:42:41,585 --> 01:42:43,644
We still have to live our life.

1688
01:42:50,795 --> 01:42:52,592
You know I love you, right?
- Yes.

1689
01:42:54,665 --> 01:42:56,929
And I know you love me too.

1690
01:43:01,472 --> 01:43:02,530
Let's go back.

1691
01:43:14,218 --> 01:43:17,949
Obviously, I can't help everyone.

1692
01:43:18,756 --> 01:43:20,018
Right?
- Yes.

1693
01:43:20,891 --> 01:43:22,483
I guess she'll understand.
- Yes.

1694
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:40,568
I'm very sorry, Carol.

1695
01:43:43,581 --> 01:43:45,640
I couldn't find your Danny, Carol.

1696
01:43:46,117 --> 01:43:47,175
I mean I...

1697
01:43:51,589 --> 01:43:55,787
It's okay. I understand.

1698
01:44:00,264 --> 01:44:01,526
Thank you.

1699
01:44:03,267 --> 01:44:04,529
God bless you.

1700
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:16,137
Let's go back home.

1701
01:44:20,217 --> 01:44:21,275
Come.

1702
01:44:34,632 --> 01:44:36,293
Gehna, I've fixed a
deal for my dad's house.

1703
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,224
Rob likes the house a lot.

1704
01:44:38,769 --> 01:44:41,795
He just wants his
wife's permission, poor guy.

1705
01:44:42,306 --> 01:44:44,866
Will I have to take your
permission after we get married?

1706
01:44:45,643 --> 01:44:47,110
Of course.
- What?

1707
01:44:47,711 --> 01:44:50,111
Why, of course?
I don't ask you anything.

1708
01:44:51,182 --> 01:44:53,309
That's because you
don't care for me.

1709
01:44:53,584 --> 01:44:56,576
That's not fair, I've
called up thrice since morning.

1710
01:44:57,321 --> 01:44:58,686
Are you fighting with me?

1711
01:44:58,989 --> 01:45:00,320
This isn't fighting.

1712
01:45:00,991 --> 01:45:04,927
I'm just saying that I fixed a
deal for dad's house, that's it.

1713
01:45:05,329 --> 01:45:08,730
Anyway, when are you coming home?
- By evening.

1714
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,659
So, are we fighting?
- No, we not.

1715
01:45:12,336 --> 01:45:14,930
Why are you asking?
- Just like that, just checking.

1716
01:45:17,007 --> 01:45:18,599
Fine, see you in the evening.
- Bye, baby. - Okay.

1717
01:45:18,676 --> 01:45:19,802
Love you.

1718
01:45:26,684 --> 01:45:27,742
What do we have here?

1719
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:52,370
Arman.
- Hey, Rob. How are you, buddy?

1720
01:45:52,643 --> 01:45:54,372
Okay.
- Hi.

1721
01:45:55,045 --> 01:45:56,103
Good to see you.

1722
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:58,375
So, she likes the house?
- She likes it a lot.

1723
01:45:58,449 --> 01:45:59,643
She likes it a lot.

1724
01:45:59,717 --> 01:46:01,184
I think she wants it.
- Great, great, great.

1725
01:46:01,252 --> 01:46:03,652
You know what... I'll
speak to the agent. - Sure.

1726
01:46:03,721 --> 01:46:04,779
And get the paperwork done.

1727
01:46:04,855 --> 01:46:06,322
And I guess in about a month...

1728
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:07,914
...you guys can move in.
- Yes, of course. - Alright.

1729
01:46:07,992 --> 01:46:09,050
Excellent.

1730
01:46:09,126 --> 01:46:10,184
Take care.
- Alright, Rob.

1731
01:47:23,467 --> 01:47:24,934
'Do you believe in angels? '

1732
01:47:58,168 --> 01:48:00,500
'Daddy, whose house
photograph is this? '

1733
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:02,368
'Of our house in Goa, son'

1734
01:48:03,507 --> 01:48:05,304
'What else should I
do other than drink? '

1735
01:48:05,509 --> 01:48:07,773
'One mistake has
ruined my entire life.'

1736
01:48:07,845 --> 01:48:10,109
'Oh, I see, and I'm that mistake.
- Yes, you are.'

1737
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:12,444
'Mama.
- I'm not your mother.'

1738
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,450
'Where are you going?
- Somewhere far from this hell.'

1739
01:48:15,519 --> 01:48:17,316
'Don't you dare step
out of this house.'

1740
01:48:17,454 --> 01:48:19,046
'Why? What will you do? '

1741
01:48:19,456 --> 01:48:25,452
'Will you kill me just like
you killed Carol? - Shut up! '

1742
01:48:25,796 --> 01:48:26,990
'Mama.
- You want your mother.'

1743
01:48:27,064 --> 01:48:29,931
'Please don't leave me.'
- 'Your father killed your mother.

1744
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,058
Get out.
- Go, just leave.

1745
01:48:31,135 --> 01:48:33,933
Come, Danny.' - 'What happened
to mama? - Who is she? '

1746
01:48:36,473 --> 01:48:39,931
'Son, be a better
person than I was.'

1747
01:49:13,577 --> 01:49:14,839
God.

1748
01:49:15,312 --> 01:49:16,370
Gehna.

1749
01:49:17,047 --> 01:49:21,347
Gehna, please come home as
soon as I get this message.

1750
01:49:25,856 --> 01:49:31,419
Carol. I want to see you
just once, just once, please.

1751
01:49:32,596 --> 01:49:33,858
Yes, Arman.

1752
01:49:35,866 --> 01:49:36,924
What happened?

1753
01:49:38,869 --> 01:49:40,427
I lied to you, Carol.

1754
01:49:44,141 --> 01:49:46,871
Since childhood,
I've seen my father screaming...

1755
01:49:46,944 --> 01:49:48,002
...in a drunken state.

1756
01:49:49,613 --> 01:49:51,604
I've always seen
my parents arguing.

1757
01:49:55,486 --> 01:50:00,219
Carol, tell me something
about your son. Please. - Danny.

1758
01:50:03,026 --> 01:50:06,894
Mischievous. He was very naughty.

1759
01:50:08,899 --> 01:50:10,958
I used to take him
swimming every Sunday.

1760
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:15,538
He had these funny
little fingers, you know.

1761
01:50:16,573 --> 01:50:19,565
His little finger
would completely bend back.

1762
01:50:21,445 --> 01:50:26,473
The first time he showed me
his bent finger, I was scared.

1763
01:50:27,317 --> 01:50:29,308
I really thought his
finger was broken.

1764
01:50:32,256 --> 01:50:35,521
After that it became
our personal game.

1765
01:50:37,194 --> 01:50:38,923
He would bend his finger and say...

1766
01:50:38,996 --> 01:50:41,658
...look mama, my finger is broken.

1767
01:50:44,067 --> 01:50:49,004
And I would say no Danny,
that's your magic finger.

1768
01:50:51,208 --> 01:50:53,142
He would be so happy...

1769
01:50:53,210 --> 01:50:55,940
...thinking that only
he had a magic finger.

1770
01:51:02,619 --> 01:51:04,553
There's a photograph there,
would you take a look, please.

1771
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:14,691
This is Michael's photo.

1772
01:51:15,432 --> 01:51:16,490
You...

1773
01:51:20,971 --> 01:51:22,495
Have you found Danny?

1774
01:51:24,975 --> 01:51:26,033
Mama.

1775
01:51:27,044 --> 01:51:29,035
Mama, look my finger is broken.

1776
01:51:38,055 --> 01:51:41,320
Danny.
- Mom.

1777
01:51:43,727 --> 01:51:45,058
You're really my Danny.

1778
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:54,660
My son. My son.
- Yes, mama.

1779
01:51:56,073 --> 01:52:00,009
I didn't leave you, you know that.
- I know.

1780
01:52:00,143 --> 01:52:01,337
I know.

1781
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:06,015
You don't know, I've
been searching for you...

1782
01:52:06,083 --> 01:52:09,018
...for the last 30 years.
- I know, mama.

1783
01:52:09,152 --> 01:52:13,088
I searched everywhere for you.
- I know, mama.

1784
01:52:13,156 --> 01:52:14,214
I know.

1785
01:52:15,158 --> 01:52:18,150
I just wanted to see you once.

1786
01:52:19,296 --> 01:52:21,594
I missed you, mama, I missed you.

1787
01:52:25,035 --> 01:52:30,735
My son. I wish I could...
- Arman.

1788
01:52:32,042 --> 01:52:33,100
What's wrong?

1789
01:52:37,247 --> 01:52:38,305
What?

1790
01:52:40,117 --> 01:52:41,175
What's wrong, baby?

1791
01:52:44,121 --> 01:52:45,179
What happened, baby?

1792
01:52:47,791 --> 01:52:49,053
Gehna.

1793
01:52:50,794 --> 01:52:52,455
Carol's my mother, Gehna.

1794
01:52:53,196 --> 01:52:54,254
She's my mother.

1795
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:02,798
What happened?
- Enough.

1796
01:53:05,208 --> 01:53:06,266
Enough.

1797
01:53:08,345 --> 01:53:10,745
I can't endure your
insanity any more.

1798
01:53:10,814 --> 01:53:12,611
What are you saying,
Gehna, she's my mother.

1799
01:53:12,683 --> 01:53:15,811
Just shut up, Arman, just shut up.

1800
01:53:16,153 --> 01:53:17,814
There's no one here, Arman.

1801
01:53:17,888 --> 01:53:19,150
There's no one here.

1802
01:53:21,158 --> 01:53:25,094
You're ill, Arman. You're ill.

1803
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:28,097
You cooked up a story in your mind...

1804
01:53:28,165 --> 01:53:30,429
...that you've to
search for her son.

1805
01:53:30,834 --> 01:53:32,096
And when you couldn't find him...

1806
01:53:32,169 --> 01:53:36,265
...you believed that you're her son.
- No, no, that isn't true.

1807
01:53:38,108 --> 01:53:41,100
I can't do this anymore, Arman.
- Gehna.

1808
01:53:41,178 --> 01:53:44,841
I can't spend my life
with a madman.

1809
01:53:46,650 --> 01:53:48,242
There's no one here.

1810
01:53:53,123 --> 01:53:54,181
Gehna.

1811
01:54:01,531 --> 01:54:03,396
Go, Danny, stop her.

1812
01:54:04,534 --> 01:54:05,592
Go.

1813
01:57:45,622 --> 01:57:46,680
Gehna.

1814
01:57:50,093 --> 01:57:53,551
No! No!

1815
01:57:55,832 --> 01:57:59,427
Gehna, he can't live without you.

1816
01:58:00,637 --> 01:58:01,831
Please, don't leave...

1817
01:58:03,106 --> 01:58:07,372
Please. Save my Danny.

1818
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:11,779
'You think I'm lying.'

1819
01:58:12,382 --> 01:58:13,474
'I'm hallucinating.'

1820
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:16,041
'What are you saying,
Gehna, she's my mother.'

1821
01:58:47,083 --> 01:58:48,516
'I don't want to lose you.'

1822
01:58:52,756 --> 01:58:54,053
'Please give me another chance.'

1823
01:58:56,593 --> 01:58:59,562
'And if I say that
I feel scared alone.'

1824
01:59:02,432 --> 01:59:05,162
'Then I won't ever leave you.'

1825
01:59:15,445 --> 01:59:17,640
'Do you know how much I love you? '

1826
01:59:31,594 --> 01:59:35,052
'Lt's rightly said,
love conquers all.'

1827
01:59:44,474 --> 01:59:45,634
Why is this space empty?

1828
01:59:46,476 --> 01:59:48,103
They are all Arman's guests.

1829
01:59:52,082 --> 01:59:54,880
And now we shall have
the reading of the vows.

1830
01:59:55,552 --> 01:59:57,577
Do you want me to read your vows?

1831
01:59:57,654 --> 01:59:59,952
No, Father, we would
like to say our own vows.

1832
02:00:02,492 --> 02:00:03,550
Arman, I love you.

1833
02:00:05,562 --> 02:00:06,893
And I will always love you.

1834
02:00:09,032 --> 02:00:13,128
I will love you so much
that you'll be fed up of me.

1835
02:00:15,105 --> 02:00:16,936
And I'll learn how to make muffins.

1836
02:00:18,842 --> 02:00:20,707
I'll believe everything you say.

1837
02:00:23,246 --> 02:00:24,975
No matter how strange it is.

1838
02:00:27,917 --> 02:00:32,684
And I promise, I'll give
you your perfect family.

1839
02:00:36,259 --> 02:00:37,590
I don't want anything.

1840
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:41,724
I just want you.

1841
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:45,927
Every moment, everywhere.

1842
02:00:47,737 --> 02:00:50,672
I love you so much.
- I love you too.

1843
02:01:07,957 --> 02:01:09,015
What happened?

1844
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:20,927
Do you see something?
- Yes.

1845
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:24,732
You. Just you.

1846
02:02:26,369 --> 02:02:27,961
No. You don't want
to be in my shoes.

1847
02:02:28,705 --> 02:02:29,763
Trust me on that.

1848
02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:50,723
We're different from
the people of this world.

1849
02:02:51,127 --> 02:02:54,324
We're shocking.

1850
02:02:54,397 --> 02:03:00,734
Now I know how madmen live.

1851
02:03:01,871 --> 02:03:07,275
We've forsaken the world
and accepted this solitude.

1852
02:03:07,343 --> 02:03:08,901
You know what I need, Ghostbusters.

1853
02:03:09,279 --> 02:03:12,339
You me and ghost.
- We're very unique.

1854
02:03:12,415 --> 02:03:13,746
You me and ghost.

1855
02:03:13,950 --> 02:03:16,214
We're fun loving.

1856
02:03:16,286 --> 02:03:17,685
You me and ghost.

1857
02:03:17,754 --> 02:03:20,154
By laying down our
lives we've shown...

1858
02:03:20,223 --> 02:03:21,315
You me and ghost.

1859
02:03:21,391 --> 02:03:25,020
We're so big hearted.

1860
02:03:43,713 --> 02:03:47,376
You're dead, but yet
you taught us to live.

1861
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:52,217
I know no one else
can do what you can.

1862
02:03:54,924 --> 02:03:56,983
We're no where.

1863
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:58,857
Yet, we're everywhere.

1864
02:03:58,928 --> 02:04:04,298
I know that the world
won't understand this.

1865
02:04:05,001 --> 02:04:08,801
What attitude and what style.

1866
02:04:08,871 --> 02:04:12,272
We were dead,
but we're back again.

1867
02:04:12,342 --> 02:04:16,301
What attitude and what style.

1868
02:04:16,379 --> 02:04:19,405
We were dead,
but we're back again.

1869
02:04:19,482 --> 02:04:26,217
Now I know how madmen live.

1870
02:04:26,923 --> 02:04:32,361
We've forsaken the world
and accepted this solitude.

1871
02:04:32,428 --> 02:04:34,020
You know what I need, Ghostbusters.

1872
02:04:34,364 --> 02:04:35,422
You me and ghost.

1873
02:04:35,498 --> 02:04:37,762
We're very unique.

1874
02:04:37,834 --> 02:04:38,926
You me and ghost.

1875
02:04:39,102 --> 02:04:41,434
We're fun loving.

1876
02:04:41,504 --> 02:04:42,835
You me and ghost.

1877
02:04:42,905 --> 02:04:45,305
By laying down our
lives we've shown...

1878
02:04:45,375 --> 02:04:46,433
You me and ghost.

1879
02:04:46,776 --> 02:04:49,108
We're so big hearted.

1880
02:04:49,178 --> 02:04:50,338
You me and ghost.

1881
02:04:52,782 --> 02:04:54,044
You me and ghost.

1882
02:04:56,519 --> 02:04:57,850
You me and ghost.

1883
02:05:00,456 --> 02:05:01,514
You me and ghost.

1884
02:05:04,794 --> 02:05:07,126
That's my story. Get it?
