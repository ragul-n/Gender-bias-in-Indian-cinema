1
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,125
<i>Your voice is the embodiment of a song.</i>

2
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,375
<i>You may have departed from this world.</i>

3
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,916
<i>But your voice will live on forever.</i>

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,625
<i>Love you and thank you</i>
<i>for everything, dear sir.</i>

5
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,166
<i>If love is really so great,</i>

6
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,083
<i>it belongs only</i>
<i>in history books and graveyards.</i>

7
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,208
<i>If love turns into marriage</i>
<i>and begets a family,</i>

8
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,791
<i>it won't be great at all.</i>

9
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,750
<i>That's why,</i>

10
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,541
<i>love exists only in history.</i>

11
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,541
<i>It doesn't have a future</i>
<i>in the society.</i>

12
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,041
<i>What do you say?</i>

13
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:55,458
UPENNA

14
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,625
PRESENT DAY 2002

15
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,333
{\an8}KOTAGIRI SESHARAYANAM
DISTRICT COUNCIL CHAIRMAN

16
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,208
{\an8}HAPPY BIRTHDAY
KOTAGIRI SESHARAYANAM

17
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,208
{\an8}-Govindu?
-Sir.

18
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,875
{\an8}It's 7 a.m. Drop Bebamma at the college.

19
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,333
{\an8}Hey!
Get Bebamma's clothes ready.

20
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,125
-Bebamma is leaving for college.
-Is that so?

21
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,416
It's Bebamma.

22
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,625
Hey, Ninety Prakasha.

23
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,375
Let's go take a peek at Bebamma.

24
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,041
If Rayanam comes to know,
we will be dead.

25
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,833
We'll make sure that we don't get caught.
Come on.

26
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,708
Come on, speed up! Faster!

27
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,166
Move a little closer. That's it.

28
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,958
Stop badgering me.
Let me drive.

29
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,791
-We must see her today at any cost.
-Sure, just be patient.

30
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,125
The car is leaving. Catch up.
Come on.

31
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,416
How dare you follow Bebamma's car?

32
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,125
How dare you follow Bebamma?

33
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,083
Please...
We'll never do this again.

34
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,541
Looks like these rogues
were chasing after Bebamma.

35
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,583
They are done for.

36
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,083
Please let me take
the first hour class for Section B.

37
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,166
No. You took all the first hour
classes last week.

38
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,416
Please, ma'am.
I am feeling a bit weak.

39
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,000
No, that's not possible.

40
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,166
Please.

41
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,750
All right. Go ahead.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,916
Thank you.

43
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,291
Students,
today, our topic is benzene.

44
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,750
This is about ecological classification
of plants.

45
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,375
Bebamma is a really nice person.

46
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,250
She gifted new clothes to my child
and gave me 1,000 rupees.

47
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,958
My master is such a miser.

48
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,666
The mandal revenue officer is here.

49
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,166
Mr. Rayanam?

50
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:35,583
Mr. Rayanam?

51
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,250
Officer, what brings you here?

52
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,666
Mr. Rayanam is upstairs.
Please take a seat, sir.

53
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,375
There's no time for that.

54
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:48,291
These are property documents
which date back 150 years.

55
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,500
I got all of them.

56
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,000
Now, Mr. Rayanam can easily proceed
with his fishing yard construction.

57
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,000
Go and call him.

58
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,166
All right, sir.

59
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,500
It's been 40 minutes.
Ask him to hurry.

60
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,250
He'll be here shortly.
Please be patient.

61
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,500
<i>Hey, how long will you take to unload?</i>

62
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,750
Mr. Rayanam?

63
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,375
Mr. Rayanam?

64
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,750
Bebamma...

65
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,125
Enough with the studies today, dear.

66
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,500
It's already quite late.

67
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,750
Drink this milk and go to bed.

68
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,708
Enough, sweetheart.

69
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,250
Keep those books aside.

70
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,625
Listen to me.
Drink some milk and go to bed.

71
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,125
You are my darling, aren't you?

72
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,000
I am talking to you.

73
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,958
Listen to me.

74
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,458
Drink up.

75
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,708
Enough with the studies today.

76
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,541
It's seven o'clock. Get Bebamma ready.

77
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,416
So, students...

78
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,958
She gave me 1,000 rupees.

79
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,291
Sir...

80
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,041
-You shouldn't be here. Come on.
-There's no one there.

81
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,333
-He's talking to an empty chair.
-She is right there.

82
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,083
-Is everyone here so crazy?
-Please leave.

83
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,958
-Any stranger can tell you the truth.
-Please leave--

84
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:05,958
Mr. Rayanam.

85
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,041
Mr. Rayanam. Sir...

86
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,041
I made a mistake.

87
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,208
Please forgive me, sir...

88
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,833
Mr. Rayanam.

89
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,583
Sir...

90
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,083
I believe that my daughter is right here.

91
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,166
And the people in my house believe it.

92
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,208
An entire village believes it.

93
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,208
Now, you want to go out

94
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,000
and tell the world
that my daughter isn't here.

95
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,916
Aren't you breaking our belief?

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,416
If it's a choice between
killing our belief system or killing you

97
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,625
I will kill you.

98
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,083
Mr. Rayanam...

99
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,333
What do you say?

100
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,833
I can see Bebamma as well.

101
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,708
Mr. Rayanam...

102
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,208
I have been your trusted aide

103
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,750
We both are from the same caste.

104
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,000
Throw him out, guys.

105
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,125
Come, sir. Why didn't you do this before?

106
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,208
You fool!

107
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,875
Why did you thrash that revenue office?

108
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,375
He just spoke the truth.

109
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,625
It's been almost five months
since your daughter left the house.

110
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,666
You've been making the entire village
believe that she is still at home.

111
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,208
You never had to worry
about your honor.

112
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:54,583
It's because you had a son
along with a daughter.

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,750
No matter where she went
during the day,

114
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,208
your son would bring her back home
by nightfall.

115
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,083
But, Father, I have a daughter.

116
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,250
When I don't know where she is,

117
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,791
it is so hard for me to go out
with my head held high.

118
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,833
Do you know that?

119
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,916
If I find him, he will be finished.
If not, I will die.

120
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,000
What do you say?

121
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,333
A FEW MONTHS AGO

122
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,875
<i>Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

123
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,458
Abbulu, you have a fever.
Why did you come here?

124
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,625
Doctor! You prick!
You poked my butt.

125
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,041
You have a fever.
I told you not to come to work.

126
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,958
Who will feed me then? Will you?

127
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,625
If you don't go home,
I'll poke you again.

128
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,125
-I'll give the prescription to your wife.
-Get lost.

129
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,750
I wonder if we can catch
a decent haul of fish.

130
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,541
Did you catch anything, guys?

131
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,583
Damn!
Again, we couldn't catch any fish.

132
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,583
Damn! It's the same ocean
and the same kind of boat.

133
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,708
They've gotten lucky.
And we are unlucky.

134
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,833
Do we have to go back
empty-handed today as well?

135
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,708
Why should we go back empty-handed?

136
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:48,375
Let's go and cut up their nets.
Then, we all can go back empty-handed.

137
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,750
What's this?
Why is the net so light?

138
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,791
Hey!

139
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,791
Those Mayapatnam people
tore up our nets again!

140
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey, Aasi!

141
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,416
Aasi, they are running away.
Go faster!

142
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,416
Aasi. Stop it.

143
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,875
Stop fighting. Stop it.

144
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,083
How dare you come to our place
and tear up our nets? You...

145
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,000
Crap!

146
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,083
How dare you both do it, huh?

147
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,125
There are four of us.
Why do you say two?

148
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,458
-Because "four" has four letters.
-So?

149
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,791
He stutters while speaking that word.
That's why,

150
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,500
he is splitting up the four of you
in two pairs and warning you.

151
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,125
Pay compensation for the nets
and the lost fish.

152
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,125
Pay it up! Pay up!

153
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,541
Why should we?
Did you see us ripping your nets?

154
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,583
-What nonsense! Pay up.
-No, we won't. Why should we?

155
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,500
-Hit them.
-We won't pay.

156
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,916
We are not going to pay.

157
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,125
Just because we have knives,
it doesn't mean we tore up your nets.

158
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,791
Did you see us do it?

159
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,666
Hey, Thalimpu.

160
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,208
The bus is coming into the village.

161
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,666
Come on, let's go to the college.

162
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,708
I'll take a bath and be back.

163
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,125
-Go get ready.
-Okay.

164
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,208
-I've seen a nice dress in the market.
-What did your mother say?

165
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,166
-Asked me to snatch your pitcher.
-My water!

166
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,500
Go away.
Stop there!

167
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,750
Nookalamma, what happened?

168
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,583
He stole my water. Jackass!

169
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,250
Get lost.

170
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,166
Why are you always after him?
Don't you have better things to do?

171
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,458
Where is my shirt? I can't find it.

172
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,250
I heard you got into a scuffle
with the people from Mayapatnam.

173
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,958
Stop doing this so early
in the morning, Dad.

174
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,791
I'm searching for my shirt.

175
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,000
Which shirt?

176
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,541
Aasi, come soon.

177
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,083
Where is it?

178
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,791
Which shirt?

179
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,125
This one!

180
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,500
Wait! Hold on.

181
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,750
-I am wearing it.
-I ironed it last night.

182
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,250
-Listen to me. I need to go out.
-Take it off, Dad.

183
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,541
Don't you have any other shirt?

184
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,208
-No.
-What's wrong with you?

185
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,583
Look, what you've done.
It's all crumpled.

186
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,375
Aasi...

187
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,958
Before leaving,
read a passage from the Bible, please.

188
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,041
It's filled with words
I can't pronounce.

189
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,083
Leave out the words you can't pronounce
and read out the rest.

190
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,000
I have a lot of work to do.

191
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,125
-How much longer?
-Look in the front.

192
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,666
Is the bus coming?

193
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,166
Yes, it is coming.
Hurry up!

194
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,666
-Do I look good?
-Let's go.

195
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,250
The bus is leaving.
It is leaving.

196
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,875
Start the bike.

197
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,125
-Let's go.
-Get on.

198
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,166
Drive! Quick.

199
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,416
{\an8}Is she on this side?

200
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,375
No, I think she is on the other side.
Go!

201
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,333
All right.

202
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,916
{\an8}The driver might notice us.
Be careful.

203
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,750
Keep going.

204
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,625
Hey... What happened?

205
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,500
What happened to the motorbike?

206
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,291
The bike's given up on us.
Damn it!

207
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,750
Look out! Be careful!

208
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,833
All right.

209
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,083
<i>I understood that God</i>
<i>is the one who grants wishes.</i>

210
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,833
<i>It's never a secret who we are born to.</i>

211
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:54,375
<i>As a child, I realized</i>
<i>who I am meant to be with.</i>

212
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,250
{\an8}BASHEER BIBI FESTIVAL
BANGARU PAPA THEERTHAM

213
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,416
<i>Suddenly, I felt a rush to grow up.</i>

214
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,541
<i>Either to seek her love,</i>

215
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,875
<i>or die after failing to win her heart.</i>

216
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,958
Mom.

217
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,500
You look amazing!

218
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,208
-Kanakam.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,291
Where are my glasses?
Where are you guys?

220
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,916
Your grandfather is a piece of work.
He keeps yelling at me all day.

221
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,541
-Hey, Kanakam!
-I'm coming.

222
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,416
Don't get irritated, Kanakam.
You will become old soon,

223
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,541
like my grandfather.

224
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,416
-Kanakam!
- Grandpa...

225
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,416
Don't be angry, Grandpa.
Anger will make you age faster.

226
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,166
-All right.
-Sit here.

227
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,208
I am old because I have aged.
I didn't grow old because of anger.

228
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:33,333
No, Grandpa, you look older than your age.

229
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,375
Really?

230
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,750
My seventh grade teacher told me

231
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,750
that when we get angry,
our body releases some hormones

232
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,833
which cause wrinkles on our skin.

233
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,666
You always get angry.
That's why,

234
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,958
even when I was a kid,
you had looked very old.

235
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,208
Hey, stop.

236
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:01,208
Finally, you have succeeded.

237
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,083
You persuaded your dad
and joined a college in town.

238
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,791
For the first time,
there's a bus coming to this village.

239
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,750
It's exclusively for you.

240
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,291
You are so beautiful.

241
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:14,041
You have a good build.
Why do you have to carry this weight?

242
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,000
Give me the bag.
Come on, give it.

243
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,750
-Give me.
-Please.

244
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,416
Leave me alone, Jana.

245
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,500
Hey, Bebamma.

246
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,916
-Nookalamma?
-Yes, Father?

247
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,958
What was the God's word last week?

248
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,750
I forgot, Father.

249
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,958
It looks like the Father
is annoyed with her.

250
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,875
Shut up, Thalimpu.

251
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,375
Everyone, get your Bibles out.

252
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,916
It's usual to avoid the dad
of the girl you love.

253
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,333
But you're avoiding the girl that
you've been in love with for a decade.

254
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,166
You are madly in love with her.

255
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,958
If I meet her once and propose to her,
she might say "yes" or "no".

256
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,333
If she says no,
I may never see her again.

257
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:56,500
That's why I love her from afar.

258
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,875
That's your logic.

259
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,083
But you drag me along with you.
And I'm getting tired of this charade.

260
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,416
Hey, Thalimpu! Keep quiet.

261
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,416
Oh, God! The Father is angry.

262
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,416
Genesis, chapter three.

263
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,166
In the beginning, God created Adam.

264
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,583
Later, when Adam was lazing around
all the time,

265
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,500
God was worried
that he would turn into an idiot.

266
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:21,041
So, God called Adam and said,
"It might hurt, but bear with it."

267
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,625
God broke one of Adam's ribs
and created Eve.

268
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:28,333
According to the Bible,
that is how a woman came into existence.

269
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,625
So, if we want a girl,
we must break our ribs.

270
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:31,875
Is that what he said?

271
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:36,250
But why is it said that girls
are born to the people who lie?

272
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,208
Really?

273
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:40,416
If liars really beget girl children,
then it makes me wonder

274
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,875
what it must have taken
to beget a beauty like her.

275
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,458
Maybe her father committed
a worse crime like murder.

276
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,291
Sir.

277
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,083
It's way too sweet, Govindam.

278
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:24,416
-Sir.
-There's too much sugar in it.

279
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,333
I'm sorry.
I'll get you another cup.

280
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:28,458
Not necessary.

281
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:30,041
Get me a handful of sugar.

282
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,333
If the mouth is sweetened,

283
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:49,375
the tea wouldn't taste so sweet.

284
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:54,500
If you want to deal with something,
you need not sabotage everything.

285
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,625
We just have to remove the things
that we don't like.

286
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,666
What do you say?

287
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:00,458
Doctor.

288
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:05,041
You usually write prescriptions
for people in the village.

289
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:09,333
Now, you and your friend wrote a complaint
against me to the collector.

290
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,625
Is that true?

291
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,333
Well, that's true.

292
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:13,625
I asked him to write it.

293
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,625
You're trying to rob us of our homes.

294
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:16,750
Where would we go?

295
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,875
We might be using your boats.

296
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,791
But the ocean
is not your personal property.

297
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,708
We are against the fishing yard.

298
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,333
Rayanam Fishing Yard is not
being built because of my need.

299
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:30,625
It's my pride.

300
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,750
Sir, they are simpletons.

301
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,041
If you evict these folks overnight,

302
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,041
their families will end up on the streets.

303
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:42,083
Who told you that they
were simpletons, doctor?

304
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,666
If they really were that simple,

305
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,500
they would pick up the fishes
washed ashore.

306
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,666
They wouldn't go into
the ocean to catch fish.

307
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,875
I won't let this happen while I'm alive.

308
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,958
Just because you have a voice,

309
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:59,500
don't think that you can raise it
against me.

310
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,625
I will not just cut you down,

311
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:04,375
I will also cut out the organ
that lets you speak.

312
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,375
It looks like the fear
in your voice is alive.

313
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,291
The courage inside you
must have already died.

314
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,625
Go and live.

315
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:33,333
Oh, my gosh!

316
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,375
Aunt, my mom always used to tell me

317
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:38,583
that you became bedridden
without producing a male heir.

318
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,916
That's why my uncle is upset with you.

319
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,666
Even though you got paralyzed
during childbirth,

320
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,750
you gave birth to a beautiful daughter
for my sake.

321
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,708
And she blossomed into a buxom beauty.

322
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:52,958
Just once...

323
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:54,875
Hey, you!

324
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,000
Mom! What happened?

325
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,500
What happened?

326
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:05,916
What happened?

327
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,083
What happened, Aunt?

328
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,958
What happened, Bebamma?

329
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,750
I told you not to touch me.

330
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,541
I'll keep touching you
even if you tell me not to.

331
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,583
Take your hand off me.

332
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:19,750
Dad...

333
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,458
Dad...

334
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,375
Even though I told Jana
to stop touching me,

335
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:28,666
he still does it.

336
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,708
Why don't you hit him once and warn him?

337
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:33,666
-What's going on?
-It's nothing, Uncle.

338
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,625
It just happened accidentally,
and she is making a scene.

339
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,541
Okay, go to college.

340
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,166
-Let's go, Officer.
-Okay.

341
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,708
<i>Is it my fault that I was born a girl?</i>

342
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,500
I keep telling Dad to sternly warn Jana,
but he doesn't lift a finger.

343
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,333
He only cares about his reputation.

344
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,291
He doesn't pay attention to you.

345
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,958
Why would he pay attention to me?

346
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,583
Why are you sad, Mom?

347
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,666
Don't worry even if your husband
doesn't help us.

348
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:09,125
Once I get married,
my husband will thrash that guy.

349
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,500
Corpus spongiosum.

350
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,333
This is corpus spongiosum.

351
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,791
It's just a description
of a man's anatomy.

352
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,458
This isn't a definition of man.

353
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,583
Ramya, why are you laughing?

354
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:31,125
Get up.

355
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,791
Tell me, what is this?

356
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,500
Manhood, ma'am.

357
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,083
Manhood?

358
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,541
Sit, sit.

359
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:45,666
If you don't mind a zoology lecturer
veering off into philosophy,

360
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,375
I'll tell you something.

361
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,000
In every woman's life, there comes a man.

362
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:55,625
If a woman can feel that man's love
for every moment of her life,

363
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,041
that is real manhood.

364
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,333
If a girl feels that having him
by her side is so fulfilling

365
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,375
that she doesn't need anything else
in life, that is manhood.

366
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:08,250
Manhood is not a mere organ
in a man's body.

367
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:11,166
It exists in every cell of his body.

368
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,666
You should be able to see that.

369
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:16,500
No one can handle erections lifelong.

370
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,375
But emotions can be handled lifelong.

371
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,458
Thalimpu, see if the bus is coming.

372
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,125
Of course, it will come.

373
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,666
It can't fly off above our heads,
like an airplane.

374
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:34,208
I heard that you guys ganged up
and attacked some boys from my village.

375
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,833
Didn't they tell you that it was one guy
who whacked them all?

376
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,083
Well said.

377
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:44,000
Do you think we'll stay quiet
if you cut up our fishing nets?

378
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:46,291
If you're so worried about nets,
then I wonder

379
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,083
what you will do if we uproot
your entire village.

380
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,958
Another word from any of you,
and I'll kick your a...

381
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,125
I'll break your glasses.

382
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,333
Glasses? Why did he say glasses?

383
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:04,166
He can't pronounce that word. So, you guys
didn't understand that he cussed you.

384
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,750
Look at that arrogant prick.

385
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,458
He can't speak without stuttering,
and yet he's arrogant.

386
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,500
A...

387
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,125
A... Ass. We'll tear your ass apart.

388
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,541
The bus is coming. Let's go.

389
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,958
Hey! Are you scared, you bastard?

390
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,208
Hit that bastard!

391
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,916
Come on! Come on, you idiots!

392
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,250
Look over there.
There is a fight going on.

393
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:16,666
See how angry he is.
He will become old soon.

394
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,541
It looks like Bebamma's college bus.

395
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,666
Bebamma, come out.

396
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,583
Bebamma.

397
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,541
-It's a traffic jam. I'll take you home.
-No.

398
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,625
-Who are you, man?
-Shut up!

399
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:35,791
Didn't you hear me?

400
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,916
-Come, let's go.
-Please, let go of me.

401
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,583
-I said, let's go.
-I don't want to.

402
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:45,916
Come on.

403
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,375
-Let go of me, Jana.
-Come on.

404
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,000
Come on.

405
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,458
Come on, you bastard.

406
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,833
How dare you cuss my father!

407
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,666
Buddy, Bebamma is looking at you.

408
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,000
Bebamma saw you.

409
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,625
Come on.

410
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,916
Come at me.

411
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,125
Let's get in.

412
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,208
Look towards the bus.

413
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,833
This guy should never age.

414
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,458
Bro, Bebamma is looking at you.

415
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,916
Yes, she is.

416
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,208
-That's what I've been telling you.
-She's looking at me.

417
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,416
Hey!

418
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,125
Corpus spongiosum!

419
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,458
-She is calling you in English.
-Yes, she is.

420
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:35,375
That is what I've been telling you.

421
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,333
She looked at me.

422
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,250
She noticed me.

423
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,750
Hey! Usually, you'll get irritated
if I touch you in my sleep.

424
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,958
And today, you are all over me.

425
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,458
Nothing, Dad. Go to sleep.

426
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,208
-What happened?
-Nothing.

427
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,791
Why did you get into a fight them?

428
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,833
If he'd cussed me, I would've ignored it.
But he cussed you.

429
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:01,041
I wish your mother was here to advise you.
She would have told you

430
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,750
not to get into fights, son.

431
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,916
When did you see Mom
for the first time, Dad?

432
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,500
Well, they said that I should get married.
And took me to a place

433
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:11,333
and made me sit in a hut.

434
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,000
They brought in a girl.

435
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,625
Your grandpa didn't want
his daughter to marry me

436
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,750
as I didn't own
a fishing net of my own.

437
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,916
When my mother and I were returning home,
that girl stalked us and confronted us.

438
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:27,333
Then she gave me a titillating look.

439
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,625
That's it.

440
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,916
I borrowed money, bought a fishing net
and married your mother.

441
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,583
So if a girl gives you a titillating look,
should you marry her?

442
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,958
I have to go fishing in the morning.
So, go to bed.

443
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:50,666
Dad! Dad! Did Mom really
give you a titillating look?

444
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,708
Yes, she gave me a titillating look.

445
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,208
Please go to sleep now.

446
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:59,000
-Dad...
-I beg you.

447
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,833
-Did Mom really give you such a look?
-My God! Please stop it!

448
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:05,166
Yes, she did give me that look.
Please...

449
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,041
-Did she really look at you like that?
-Please go to sleep.

450
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,333
Oh, God...

451
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,416
Kothapalli Padma.

452
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:19,916
Hold your bag.

453
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,791
If I don't pick up the rations today,
my wife will lash at me.

454
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:26,375
-Shankaram?
-Yes, Govindu.

455
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,666
-Add two extra kilos for each item.
-Okay.

456
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,625
Sir?

457
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,291
I am talking to you, sir.

458
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,958
-What is it?
-All of us are standing in line.

459
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,375
-Stand in line.
-How dare you raise your voice?

460
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,208
FAIR PRICE SHOP

461
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,083
Why get into a fight with Govindu?

462
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,208
I just asked him to stand in line.

463
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:43,708
I should stand in a line?

464
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,666
-What?
-Rascal!

465
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,958
-What...
-Aasi!

466
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,166
Govindu.

467
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,250
Go and stand in the line.

468
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:19,125
Yesterday, Bebamma told her servant
to stand in line at the shop.

469
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,666
She again looked at me in a special way.

470
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,208
You are getting lucky.

471
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,000
Why did the bus stop?

472
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,916
-The driver is getting down.
-Do you think he noticed us?

473
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,583
Yes. Why else would he stop?

474
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,708
Oh, goodness! I fear the worst now.

475
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,333
-I'm going to pee now.
-Don't worry. I'll deal with him.

476
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:41,166
Hey, you!
Where are you from?

477
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,958
I just got down to pee, sir.

478
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:43,916
We are from Uppada.

479
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh, you guys are from Uppada!

480
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,375
Nothing.

481
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,541
The bus broke down.

482
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,083
-Bebamma has to take an exam.
-Bebamma?

483
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:55,000
I see no auto rickshaws around.
Can you drop her at her college?

484
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,458
We can't do that, man.

485
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,250
-Please listen to me.
-Nagaraju!

486
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,791
-Yes, Bebamma.
-Did you find any auto rickshaw?

487
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,958
I asked somebody I know for help.

488
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,708
If you don't mind...

489
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,083
Why would I get on a stranger's... bike?

490
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,083
Here you go.

491
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:42,791
-Do you think this is a scooter?
-No.

492
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,375
You start it.

493
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,458
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

494
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,750
-Washroom.
-Okay, go.

495
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:40,291
Come on, go.

496
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:08,250
Why do you put me through this?
You have been at it for days.

497
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,166
Don't say that.

498
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,083
You've followed her enough.
At least today, muster up the courage

499
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,666
and go and talk to her.

500
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:15,166
Bebamma?

501
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,500
-Call her loudly.
-Bebamma!

502
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,291
She is coming here. She is coming.

503
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,916
Talk to her.

504
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,083
Bebamma? Why do you say Bebamma?

505
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,666
My name is not Bebamma.

506
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,541
Her name is not Bebamma?

507
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,208
What? Isn't your name Bebamma?

508
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,500
-No?
-No.

509
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,583
Ask for her name.

510
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,583
Hey, Bebamma. What's your name?

511
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,416
She didn't react at all.

512
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:47,291
If you don't tell me your name,
I will get angry.

513
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,958
Would you like it if I age quickly?
Do you want me to get old soon?

514
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,500
Buddy, she is writing something.

515
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:58,708
Yes.

516
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,500
"San...

517
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,041
"Gee...

518
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,916
"Tha...

519
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:09,750
Sangeetha.

520
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:12,250
SANGEETHA

521
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,375
San...

522
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:19,916
G...

523
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,000
G...

524
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Tha...

525
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,125
Santha!

526
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:31,875
Santha?

527
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,375
This will be the biggest hurdle ever.

528
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:39,791
Santha!

529
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:45,541
Santha!

530
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:46,750
Damn it! Say "Sangeetha."

531
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:54,833
-Did I say it correctly?
-Of course not! Try it again.

532
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:57,208
Go ahead. Say "Sangeetha."

533
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:02,083
I did it.

534
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,708
Where?

535
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,083
-Under the water.
-Under the water?

536
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,625
I was the one who said it.

537
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,208
Sang... tha!

538
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:12,083
It's enough. Let's go.

539
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:16,125
Looks like Bebamma is not lucky enough
to hear you her call her name lovingly.

540
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,791
-Get lost!
-Oh, goodness!

541
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:21,791
Santha!

542
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,083
Damn!

543
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:24,916
Yuck!

544
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:26,250
Oh, Dad!

545
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,458
The same old fish curry again today?
It's irritating.

546
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,708
What happened, son?

547
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,708
Maybe I got my stutter
because of eating too much fish.

548
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:34,166
And, it's only getting worse.

549
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,666
Don't be so angry, son.

550
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,666
I shouldn't get angry.
I shouldn't.

551
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:40,083
If I get angry, I will get age quickly.

552
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,583
Dad.

553
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,125
What?

554
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,333
Don't take things to heart.
If you do, you'll get old quickly.

555
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:47,458
Okay?

556
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:53,041
Santha!

557
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,375
You can't speak your heart out
to your beloved.

558
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:59,375
You can only speak with your stutter.

559
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,500
-That's why I'm doing this.
-What is it?

560
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:04,333
A book about love and a blank paper.
What will you do with them?

561
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:06,083
I'll fill this sheet
about love from this book.

562
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:08,791
My goodness! Okay, go on. Fill it up.

563
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,541
Love should be like
the love story of Laila and Majnu,

564
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:14,333
Devdas and Parvati,

565
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:15,833
Romeo and Juliet...

566
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,875
It should be very special and unique.

567
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:20,750
I know about Devadas,

568
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,458
and I know about Majnu.

569
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,666
But who is the male character
in Romeo and Juliet?

570
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:30,458
-Who knows?
-Oh! Even you don't know!

571
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,416
Ro-me-o.

572
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,416
Ju-Li-et.

573
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,916
The "et" in Juliet is emphatic.
So, Juliet must be a man.

574
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,791
-Are you sure?
-I am sure.

575
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:43,166
Once this page is filled with your love,
you will join those legends, Aasi.

576
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,291
Of course, I will.

577
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,291
As long as Rayanam
doesn't get wind of this, it's all fine.

578
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,833
But if he does,
it'll be a different story.

579
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:54,166
Well, we can certainly write the letter.
But who is going to give it to her?

580
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,625
My goodness!

581
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,500
Don't involve me in this in any way.

582
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:01,625
I swear to God I can't do this.

583
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:03,750
Why do you drag God into this?

584
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:10,916
Oh, Goddess!

585
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:17,083
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Aasi told me to give this to you.

586
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,000
-Thalimpu, I am very nervous.
-Why?

587
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,833
-Do you think she read my letter?
-Maybe.

588
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:30,583
-Will she come here?
-I'm sure she'll come to this festival.

589
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:34,166
The festival won't begin
until Rayanam comes and offers clothes.

590
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:54,958
Bebamma is here, bro.

591
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,500
Sir, we need to talk to you
regarding Waqf Board lands.

592
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,541
You didn't have to write that letter.

593
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:08,625
You look so nervous.
If you go to her now

594
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,250
she will know
that you're in love with her.

595
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,625
Buddy, she is looking at you.

596
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:23,208
-She is calling you. Go.
-I won't.

597
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,750
-Buddy, just go.
-No.

598
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:29,916
-She is calling you. Just go.
-I'm scared. Why don't you come along?

599
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:34,125
She called only you.
You can't take me along now.

600
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,125
Go now.

601
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,333
<i>Everybody, be ready.</i>

602
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:41,583
<i>In a short while, we will distribute</i>
<i>the holy sandalwood paste.</i>

603
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,000
What's up?

604
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,125
You asked for my name
and walked away silently.

605
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,666
Well, the thing is...

606
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,833
This is the letter you gave me.
Read it.

607
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:04,333
<i>-Thalimpu.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

608
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:07,125
To ensure that my stutter
doesn't ruin my love,

609
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,750
fill this letter with my words.

610
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:10,125
G...

611
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:13,916
That syllable may escape my throat.
Let's see how it can escape my letter.

612
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,500
All right, listen up then.

613
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:18,958
<i>After you came into my life,</i>
<i>my heart began to celebrate.</i>

614
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,541
It's a sheer delight
to hear you say that syllable.

615
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,500
-Go on, proceed.
-All right, I will.

616
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,083
-I've filled it up as you've asked.
-Is it good?

617
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:28,583
Don't worry.
This letter will simply floor the girl.

618
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,916
No girl will fall
for such a lousy love letter.

619
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,541
Instead, you'll be laughed at.

620
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,625
I didn't write this letter to woo you.
I did it to make you laugh.

621
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:45,958
The words in that letter
might appear borrowed.

622
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:50,000
But since my childhood,
I have always had a strong liking for you.

623
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:52,083
I've been telling the same to myself.

624
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,583
Strong liking, huh?
What do you mean?

625
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,416
It has started, come on.

626
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,541
It means...

627
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:20,750
Doctor, he's been shivering since last
night. Did he get scared of something?

628
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,541
I heard you got a fever.
Your father is very worried.

629
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:26,250
When I told Bebamma that I liked her,

630
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,291
she didn't say a word.

631
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:30,041
Instead, she kissed me and left.

632
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:32,000
Kissed you?

633
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:37,250
And that too, a special kind of kiss.

634
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,375
You told her that you loved her.

635
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:43,583
And she said she loved you too,
through a kiss.

636
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:52,166
-Are there any scars?
-What's the matter?

637
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,125
Last night, you appeared in my dream,
and I pinched you.

638
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:56,500
There's no marks.

639
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,625
"Love you I?"

640
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:02,666
Hey!

641
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:06,666
You wrote it wrong.

642
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:08,583
Shouldn't it be "I love you"?

643
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,583
I don't want "love" to keep us apart.
So, I set love aside.

644
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:13,708
"Love you I."

645
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,458
So "you" and "I" will always be together.

646
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,041
A toothbrush?

647
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:26,458
Yes, this what I use to brush my teeth.

648
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,375
From tomorrow onwards, use this one.

649
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,125
San... gee... tha...

650
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,250
Say it.

651
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,458
San... g...

652
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:09,375
Bebamma!

653
00:53:33,791 --> 00:53:35,208
Aasi, look!

654
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:37,833
See how I sweat
when I sit next to you.

655
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,583
Aasi, I won't be able to meet you
for the next three days.

656
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,375
I can't bear to be away from you.

657
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,375
Let me give you a kiss.

658
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:23,333
You will then catch a fever.
And you can go home and rest.

659
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:24,333
Okay?

660
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:40,208
<i>It's been three days since I saw Bebamma.</i>
<i>Does this shirt look good?</i>

661
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,666
Greetings.

662
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:43,791
Dasu, come with us.

663
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,625
-Dad, let me come with you.
-Why?

664
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:47,833
-Let me come.
-What for?

665
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:49,875
-Please, let me join you.
-Fine. Let's go.

666
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:58,041
This is going to be the last meeting
regarding your houses. Go on.

667
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,375
He is too arrogant.

668
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:39,750
Greetings.

669
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:41,750
I am Aasi.

670
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:46,958
I don't know if Bebamma
has told you about me.

671
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:48,291
But she always talks about you.

672
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:50,208
Bebamma loves you a lot.

673
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:55,125
If you don't mind,
I will go and meet Bebamma once.

674
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:01,291
Rayanam might benefit a lot
from the construction of the fishing yard.

675
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:03,916
But the fact is, you all
stand to gain more than him.

676
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,458
Your children's future will be bright.

677
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:09,750
You can stay far out and venture
into the ocean when needed.

678
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,875
Rayanam will talk to the government

679
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:15,250
to ensure that you all receive
new houses.

680
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,416
Try to understand.

681
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,625
Officer, this is unfair.

682
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,041
We depend on the sea for our livelihood.

683
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:24,333
You're telling us to live miles away
from the village and the sea.

684
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:25,708
How is that possible?

685
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,083
But it makes no difference at all,
does it?

686
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,625
How can you say that, sir?

687
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,625
Our houses are on the raised shoreline,
and we've been used to that.

688
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:39,291
All these years,
the sea has always greeted us pleasantly,

689
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,083
but it has never uprooted our houses.

690
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,500
Our lives are just like that of a fish.
If you keep us away from water,

691
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:47,083
we won't be able to live at all.

692
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:51,958
We cannot survive without
the salty air of the ocean.

693
00:56:52,416 --> 00:56:53,666
Please have mercy on us.

694
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:59,208
Whether you wish to go out
into the ocean on boats,

695
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,916
or earn a living to feed yourselves,

696
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,833
it all depends on my mercy.

697
00:57:04,916 --> 00:57:06,083
-Sir--
-No. Impossible.

698
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:07,958
We object to the construction
of the fishing yard.

699
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:09,166
What did you say?

700
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,750
Aasi, how did you come here?
What if someone sees you?

701
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:21,541
Do you think this is a joke, and you
can go back and forth like an ocean wave?

702
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:22,750
It's the government.

703
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:27,000
Once it makes up its mind,
there is no turning back.

704
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,500
It will do what it wants.
Anything else?

705
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:30,708
Why did you come here?

706
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,250
You've been coming to meet me every day.

707
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,208
So, for a change, I wanted to visit you.

708
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:36,791
Aren't you scared?

709
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:39,333
I wasn't a while ago.
But now I am.

710
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,833
Do you want to get a fever?

711
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:43,500
No?

712
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:47,625
Mr. Rayanam, please don't lose your cool.
Please sit down.

713
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:51,000
We need a group photo for the newspapers.

714
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:53,250
Let's take a group photo with Mr. Rayanam.

715
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,666
Sir, just one photo.

716
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:57,333
Come on, everyone. The meeting is over.

717
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,791
What's wrong with your dad?
Where will we go if he evicts us?

718
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,791
Unlike you, we don't have multiple houses.

719
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:14,333
Aasi, you appeared in my dream again
last night.

720
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,833
Maybe there is a scar...

721
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,250
What are you talking about?

722
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,541
Come here. Come.

723
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,250
-I'll make you feverish.
-Let me go.

724
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:32,458
I'm sorry.

725
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:47,083
Do you know how angry I am right now?

726
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:51,708
But I'm worried that if I get angry and
grow old, who is going to look after you?

727
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:53,625
Move closer.

728
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,875
Come close, Aasi.

729
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,125
If you don't have a house,
go and live in the ocean.

730
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,708
I can live with you
wherever you choose to.

731
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,250
Here comes the bus.

732
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:17,958
I can't hear a thing.

733
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,625
I am not going home.

734
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:24,541
-Did you just arrive?
-Yes, I just dropped by.

735
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:25,958
My dear niece,

736
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:28,791
why have you been complaining
about my son to your father?

737
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:32,875
You are going to get married to him,
sooner or later. Keep that in mind.

738
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:36,250
Come on! You can't rein in your husband,
but advise others.

739
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:39,958
Father, you may detest me for saying this.

740
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:43,250
But a girl's body and heart
will change with age.

741
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,708
It's better to rush these things up.

742
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:45,875
Where is my brother?

743
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,958
Kanakam.

744
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:52,333
-Kanakam!
-Sir?

745
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:55,458
Don't you serve tea
or coffee to the guests?

746
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:56,666
I will get them, sir.

747
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:59,416
I don't care if you keep stalling.
I do have the right

748
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,458
to ask for my niece's hand in marriage,
don't I?

749
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:04,666
You will always have the right to do so.

750
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,458
But your household is not worthy
to receive her.

751
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:10,333
Your husband ditched you
and went to live with a lower caste girl,

752
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:12,916
and washed his dirty linen in public.

753
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,166
It severed all ties between him
and this family.

754
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,208
If you can, tell me where your
husband is right now.

755
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:28,875
I can't bow my head in shame so easily.

756
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,333
Do you get it?

757
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:35,541
I will not forge an alliance with a family
that has lost its honor.

758
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,291
Brother, please...

759
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:38,958
We are siblings.

760
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:40,500
I can't deny that.

761
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:43,208
But I can't turn our bond
into an alliance with your family.

762
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,708
Have your tea and leave.

763
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,083
I will have tea at my house.

764
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,500
Damera Phanindra. You know him, don't you?

765
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:06,916
He's is the rural MLA.
This is his son's photo.

766
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:09,125
He is from our caste.

767
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,666
They will visit us shortly to see
my daughter.

768
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:14,916
Listen, son--

769
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:17,458
<i>A warning to all the fishermen of Uppada.</i>

770
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,291
<i>According to our annual tradition,</i>

771
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:23,375
<i>if anyone takes their boats</i>
<i>to the ocean and engage in fishing,</i>

772
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:25,333
<i>between 15th April and 3rd June,</i>

773
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:28,000
<i>they will be fined heavily.</i>

774
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,958
We saved a tenth of our earnings
in this collection box.

775
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:34,750
It's the time for the fishes to breed.

776
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:36,791
So, we can't go fishing for 45 days,

777
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:39,083
this will be the source of our livelihood.

778
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:42,541
We're distributing our savings equally
to all the 150 families here.

779
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:43,875
Spend it wisely.

780
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,708
-Here you go.
-Take it, Devudu.

781
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:51,791
Granny, you can take my money too.

782
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:53,833
May God bless you, dear.

783
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:02,625
Mom, I have been told that a suitor
is coming here to see me in two days.

784
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:05,708
I am not interested in marrying him.

785
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:21,625
Hey! Make it quick, guys.

786
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:22,875
Bring them on.

787
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:25,166
-Has everyone come back?
-Yes, Dad.

788
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:28,541
Put all the boats ashore. Mr. Rayanam
wants everything accounted for.

789
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:00,125
Aasi?

790
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,291
"Come to the college at 2 p.m. today."

791
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,958
No one saw this.
Let's go.

792
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,833
-Come on, get in.
-Drive.

793
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:22,791
Did everyone put away their boats ashore?

794
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:24,833
<i>No matter who they are, don't show mercy.</i>

795
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,833
<i>Even if they are eating a meal,</i>
<i>drag them out of their houses.</i>

796
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,250
By tomorrow morning, I should see

797
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:33,625
the board of Rayanam Fishing Yard there.

798
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:34,666
Okay, sir.

799
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,375
Buddy, keep going.

800
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:52,916
What happened, Bebamma? Tell me.

801
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,333
I am not feeling good.

802
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,208
Can we just go to the sea?

803
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:04,750
Now? To the sea?

804
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:08,041
No boat is going
to venture out into the ocean.

805
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,791
You can go on and love
however much you want.

806
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:15,750
This is the time when the fish
get intimate.

807
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,333
We can't disturb them.

808
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:20,458
Intimacy means getting together
and making love.

809
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:22,875
And you are doing the same.

810
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,666
You won't be bothering them.

811
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:30,958
Aasi, get back before nightfall.

812
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:31,916
All right.

813
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,666
I hope no one saw us.

814
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,625
What happened?

815
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,958
We've run out of gas.

816
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:31,625
What do we do now?

817
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:36,208
I am at work. I will talk to you later.

818
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:40,791
Sir.

819
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:45,750
The college bus should have been here
by now. Bebamma isn't back home yet.

820
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:46,958
What?

821
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:02,958
Hello?

822
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:05,166
This is Rayanam speaking.

823
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,083
Yes, Mr. Rayanam.

824
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:09,916
Why hasn't the bus come back yet?

825
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,208
Mr. Rayanam?

826
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,250
<i>Bebamma has not yet returned home.</i>

827
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,750
She told the lecturer

828
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:17,208
that she wasn't well
and left in the afternoon.

829
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:21,625
I am just checking
how vigilant you are.

830
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:26,875
She must have gone to the movies
with friends.

831
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,125
She will be home shortly.

832
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,541
-What do you say?
-Yes, sir.

833
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,791
Sir, no. Please...

834
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,750
No, please...

835
01:06:58,166 --> 01:06:59,666
My God!

836
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:02,500
We toiled day and night
to build that house.

837
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:06,083
Now you are razing it to the ground.
This is unfair.

838
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,125
<i>Why isn't he back yet?</i>

839
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:15,583
How could you destroy our homes
for your fishing yard? Damn you!

840
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:18,333
We discussed this with Mr. Rayanam.

841
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:19,541
Look what he's done, Jalayya.

842
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,333
<i>What's wrong with Bebamma?</i>

843
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:51,416
<i>She always wanders about the beach</i>

844
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,375
<i>and returns home covered in sand.</i>

845
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,416
Why are your clothes wet, dear?

846
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,625
I went to the beach with my friends, Dad.

847
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:03,708
Mr. Rayanam,

848
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,625
<i>no one should to go out</i>
<i>to the sea now.</i>

849
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,333
A guy from your village just
took a boat into the sea.

850
01:09:08,416 --> 01:09:09,791
<i>There was a girl with him.</i>

851
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:12,500
I am busy. I will talk to you later.

852
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:27,750
My God! Now, it's all ruined.

853
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:31,000
Sir, Mr. Rayanam is here.

854
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:35,666
Sir...

855
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:42,583
How could you destroy our houses
for your fishing yard?

856
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:44,958
Rayanam, this is unfair.

857
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:46,583
We discussed this, didn't we?

858
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:50,375
If you destroy our houses like this,
where are we supposed to go?

859
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,708
Our children
are going to be badly affected.

860
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:56,125
-Jalayya.
-Sir.

861
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,583
I need to speak with you.

862
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:01,583
Sir, please stop this.
Please ask them to stop razing our homes.

863
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,750
We will be ruined, sir.
Please stop this.

864
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,333
Something is fishy.

865
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:08,541
Ask them to stop, please.
Please have mercy on us.

866
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,375
-Jalayya.
-Sir?

867
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:15,583
No one is supposed to go out to sea
for the next 45 days, right?

868
01:10:15,666 --> 01:10:17,583
Yes, sir. That is what we all agreed to.

869
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,791
But there was a boat that went
to sea today.

870
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,208
A boat? No.

871
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:23,875
Of course, yes. It did.

872
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:27,166
Let's assume that someone was desperate
to make a living.

873
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:30,916
He must come back by evening, right?
Then, why hasn't he come yet?

874
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:34,500
Sir, we are worried about lives,
why are you talking about the boats?

875
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,416
If it was just about of a boat,
I wouldn't have come this far.

876
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:49,333
My daughter was also on that boat.

877
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:50,708
Sir...

878
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:55,000
Did someone among you
take her out to sea?

879
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,791
Or did someone help the guy
who took her out?

880
01:10:57,875 --> 01:10:59,333
No matter what the case is,

881
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:03,625
the news that my daughter wasn't home
has slipped out.

882
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:08,250
If my daughter isn't home by dawn,

883
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:10,458
the entire village would know about it.

884
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:18,875
-Jalayya.
-Sir.

885
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,333
If my daughter is home by dawn,

886
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:24,541
all of you can keep your houses forever.

887
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:27,583
Be careful.

888
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:31,291
For me, my honor and my life
are inseparable from one another.

889
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:32,625
They are the same.

890
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,125
Yes, sir. Yes.

891
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:37,000
They say that when a rich man dies,
he doesn't die alone.

892
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:39,666
And in this case,
it's my 18-year-old daughter.

893
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:42,083
And she won't go alone either.

894
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:43,375
Look,

895
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:46,500
it will lead to the death and suffering

896
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:49,083
of everyone in those 150 houses.

897
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:54,416
Take only those we can trust,
and bring her back. OK?

898
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:11,166
Aasi! Where the hell are you?

899
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,416
Uncle? Uncle?

900
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:17,458
Where is Aasi?

901
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:30,416
Bebamma...

902
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:33,583
What are you looking at?

903
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:38,041
You said that the fishes gather
to make love.

904
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:39,708
I'm just trying to see them.

905
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:40,708
Aren't you scared?

906
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,958
No one will come here
until the next new moon.

907
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,666
And we can't even go anywhere.

908
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,208
Then, let's enjoy this moment

909
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:54,041
and make it a night to remember
for the next 80 years.

910
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:26,666
-Govindu.
-Sir?

911
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:29,750
Do you think that the sky
and the ocean can ever meet?

912
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:34,833
No matter how tall the waves rise,
they can never reach the sky.

913
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,166
What if the sky bends?

914
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:44,583
What's the date today?

915
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:47,625
18th April, 2002.

916
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,333
Remember this day.

917
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,333
I, Kotagiri Sesharayanam,

918
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:58,916
could die in the year 2012,

919
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:01,208
or in the year 2022.

920
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:05,958
Whoever dragged my honor
and status into the sea,

921
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:07,750
he must die by my hand.

922
01:18:09,166 --> 01:18:13,333
My daughter's attendance at the college
today must be confirmed by her lecturer.

923
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:15,916
If even one out of these two
doesn't happen,

924
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:18,958
mark this as the date of my death
on my grave.

925
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,833
If you die before that,

926
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:27,291
tell your son to do this one thing for me.

927
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:32,041
This has to happen.

928
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:33,875
Okay?

929
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:47,750
<i>My daughter's attendance at the college</i>
<i>today must be confirmed by her lecturer.</i>

930
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,458
Number one, Swathi.

931
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:13,541
Present, ma'am.

932
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,166
Number two, Sravani.

933
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,250
Present, ma'am.

934
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:18,250
<i>Number three, Ramya.</i>

935
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:19,583
<i>Present, ma'am.</i>

936
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,833
<i>Number four, Priyanka.</i>

937
01:19:22,333 --> 01:19:23,333
<i>Present, ma'am.</i>

938
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:25,333
<i>Number five, Sangeetha.</i>

939
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:29,083
Number five, Kotagiri Sangeetha.

940
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:32,666
Number five, Kotagiri Sangeetha.

941
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:37,041
<i>Kotagiri Sangeetha!</i>

942
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:39,125
<i>Present, ma'am.</i>

943
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:18,083
We have made a big mistake, Bebamma.

944
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,791
Then, marry me, Aasi.

945
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:28,458
We can rectify this mistake.

946
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,833
Aasi!

947
01:20:47,666 --> 01:20:49,791
Enough of this madness! Get on.

948
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,208
Sir, Bebamma is here.

949
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:08,583
Mr. Rayanam, there was nobody else
other than Bebamma.

950
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:12,375
Sir, you told me to take
only my trusted aides along.

951
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:15,416
There is my brother and my son
and this is my brother-in-law.

952
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,625
Sir.

953
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:21,458
We will always protect your honor
and the reputation of your family.

954
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,083
I promise you.

955
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,458
Now, Mr. Rayanam,

956
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:29,375
as you promised,
please give our houses back to us.

957
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:31,625
We will somehow eke out a living.

958
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:35,250
Let's go.

959
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:39,083
-Govindu.
-Sir?

960
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,166
Start the car.

961
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,791
Who the hell is he?

962
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,666
Rayanam, didn't I tell you

963
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,791
not to let a girl her age
step out of the house?

964
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:07,541
When you sent her out,

965
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:09,958
I knew she wouldn't
just focus on her education.

966
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:11,000
Who is it?

967
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,250
She will never say it.

968
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:14,750
We have to figure out who that dog is.

969
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:16,958
Don't lay a finger on her.

970
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:19,500
She went running into the arms
of a stray dog,

971
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,500
thinking that it loved her.

972
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:26,166
She should know how much
the people in this family love her.

973
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,041
-Kanakam.
-Yes, sir.

974
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:33,208
Take Bebamma inside
and serve her food, go.

975
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,291
-Govindu.
-Sir?

976
01:22:44,333 --> 01:22:47,583
From tomorrow,
you must escort Bebamma to college.

977
01:22:47,666 --> 01:22:50,833
-Okay.
-Why do you still send her out? Kill her!

978
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:55,208
She is not the one to be killed.
It is the guy she was with.

979
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:57,083
They are going to kill you.

980
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,791
Why didn't you tell me?

981
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,416
As your father, why would I oppose you
becoming the son-in-law of Rayanam?

982
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:07,791
But...

983
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:12,625
Why would Rayanam accept you
as his son-in-law, Aasi?

984
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:15,583
Aasi?

985
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:19,958
What is wrong with you?

986
01:23:21,583 --> 01:23:23,375
Had Rayanam ventured out into the sea

987
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,833
you would have been caught and killed.

988
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:28,041
Take my advice and forget that girl.

989
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:31,083
If we returned the girl,

990
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,458
Rayanam promised to give our houses back.

991
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:37,666
If your love is more important
than the lives of 150 families,

992
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:39,583
do whatever you wish.

993
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:12,291
You listened to your father
and brought Bebamma back.

994
01:24:12,375 --> 01:24:15,833
Rayanam unleashed his wrath on us
because his daughter went out with a guy.

995
01:24:16,041 --> 01:24:17,833
If he finds out that it was you...

996
01:24:29,125 --> 01:24:30,125
Aasi.

997
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,125
Come and have some food.

998
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:39,666
Aasi, what's wrong with you?

999
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:44,500
Were you here all night?
It will kill you.

1000
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:52,041
Aasi...

1001
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,750
SANGEETHA

1002
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,958
-Govindu.
-Sir?

1003
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,000
Keep an eye on all the young boys
in the village.

1004
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:27,083
Yes, sir.

1005
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:30,958
Make sure no one gets a whiff
of what we are looking for

1006
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:33,500
and why we are looking for him.

1007
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:37,291
Whose son are you?

1008
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:38,958
I'm Gandham Subba Rao's son.

1009
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:45,250
Why are there so many boys
near a women's college?

1010
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,708
Why? Is there any problem?

1011
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:49,500
Nothing. Just leave.

1012
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,208
VISAKHAPATNAM

1013
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:23,291
-Dad...
-It isn't safe for you to be here.

1014
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:26,458
Go to Visakhapatnam
and stay there with your aunt.

1015
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,875
Go on.

1016
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:50,125
What brings you by here, Govindu?

1017
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:54,083
Mr. Rayanam instructed us to get
all the boats painted.

1018
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:58,000
-Are all the boys present in the village?
-Yes, they are. Where will they go?

1019
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,500
Where is your son?

1020
01:26:59,583 --> 01:27:00,708
My son?

1021
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:02,166
He...

1022
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,541
He went for fishing.

1023
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:07,750
Fishing is prohibited
until the next new moon day.

1024
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:11,458
Sorry, I misspoke.
He must have gone down that road.

1025
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:16,375
There he is.

1026
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:21,041
All right, Jalayya. I have to go now.

1027
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:23,416
Send your boy to paint the boats.

1028
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:24,750
All right.

1029
01:27:24,916 --> 01:27:25,875
See you.

1030
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,166
Oh, my God!

1031
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,625
What was he doing near
a women's college? Thrash him.

1032
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:42,166
Sir, why are you hitting me?

1033
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:44,500
Mr. Rayanam, please...

1034
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:47,875
Please stop this.

1035
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:50,750
Why do you keep doing this?
Please stop it.

1036
01:27:51,791 --> 01:27:54,666
Kotagiri Sesharayanam
was my great grandfather.

1037
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,166
I am named after him.

1038
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:03,041
Whenever the British officials
came to our house to meet him,

1039
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:06,333
they would leave their boots
outside the door.

1040
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:09,041
That is the kind of reputation he enjoyed.

1041
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:12,791
He bequeathed the same legacy
to my grandfather.

1042
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:17,333
This legacy of honorable reputation
that began with my ancestors

1043
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:21,625
has lived on for 125 years
and been passed to me.

1044
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:25,458
That reputation is now being
ruined by my 18-year-old daughter.

1045
01:28:27,166 --> 01:28:29,833
And I am unable to uphold my legacy.

1046
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,833
-Govindu.
-Sir?

1047
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:02,708
Out of all these photos on this wall,

1048
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,250
this one gives me immense joy right now.

1049
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:11,625
That day when Jalayya

1050
01:29:12,791 --> 01:29:15,000
<i>was handing over my daughter to me,</i>

1051
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:19,916
<i>his son looked at my daughter</i>
<i>in a different way. Why?</i>

1052
01:29:20,166 --> 01:29:22,208
<i>Now I understand why.</i>

1053
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:28,375
Today is the new moon day, right?

1054
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:29,333
Yes, sir.

1055
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:34,250
-Govindu.
-Sir?

1056
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,916
Do they still quarrel
with the neighboring village?

1057
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,333
-Yes, they do.
-Sure?

1058
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,166
-Yes, sir.
-Are you sure?

1059
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,333
Yes, they do.

1060
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:49,583
<i>A warm welcome to everyone</i>

1061
01:29:49,666 --> 01:29:52,208
<i>who is attending this annual festival</i>
<i>in Uppada</i>

1062
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:56,041
<i>hosted in honor of our</i>
<i>village deity, Gangalamma.</i>

1063
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:13,708
-How is your health, dear?
-I am fine, Uncle.

1064
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:35,500
The festivities are in full swing.

1065
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:16,333
How dare you!
How dare you touch me!

1066
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:17,875
What the hell, girl!

1067
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,375
Uncle, look. He is harassing me.

1068
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:21,541
What are you doing?

1069
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:23,083
Did you see me touching her?

1070
01:31:23,166 --> 01:31:26,375
The girl has complained to us.
The guys from your village are pathetic.

1071
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:28,250
Don't you dare talk about my village.

1072
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,000
-Dad!
-Uncle!

1073
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:35,500
Hit him!

1074
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:37,791
How dare you punch a guy from my village?

1075
01:31:51,833 --> 01:31:52,875
Stop it!

1076
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:53,791
Stop it, please!

1077
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,541
Aasi...

1078
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:08,166
Hey...

1079
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:14,416
No, stop it. Please stop it.

1080
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,041
Aasi!

1081
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:44,166
Aasi...

1082
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:50,333
Aasi!

1083
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:51,333
Let go of him.

1084
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:52,625
-Dad!
-Aasi!

1085
01:33:22,083 --> 01:33:24,375
They killed Aasi's father, Bebamma.

1086
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:27,958
A fight broke out between us
and the guys from the other village.

1087
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:30,166
Aasi was badly hurt.

1088
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:33,083
Where is Aasi now?

1089
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:34,958
CHRISTIAN MEDICAL HOSPITAL

1090
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:46,333
Where are you going?
Hop on.

1091
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,208
-Brother?
-Yes.

1092
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:57,791
What happened?
How come you are calling me up so late?

1093
01:33:58,416 --> 01:34:01,208
You left my house tearfully the other day
because of me.

1094
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:03,541
Dad is really distressed by that.

1095
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:04,708
Anyway...

1096
01:34:06,208 --> 01:34:09,500
How can I blame you and your son
for the follies of your husband?

1097
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:14,583
Well, you said...

1098
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:21,875
As you said, find an auspicious date
for the wedding and let me know.

1099
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:24,708
<i>My daughter will become</i>
<i>your daughter-in-law.</i>

1100
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:26,833
This is my promise.

1101
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:28,458
Sure, Brother.

1102
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,833
My daughter has lost her honor.

1103
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:39,958
The only way to keep this a secret,
is to get her married within the family.

1104
01:34:53,666 --> 01:34:54,958
-Careful.
-Aasi.

1105
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:13,666
<i>Aasi...</i>

1106
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:17,583
Please read me a verse
from the Bible before you head out.

1107
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:41,958
Hey!

1108
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:43,458
-Sir?
-Sir?

1109
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:44,500
Come...

1110
01:38:44,583 --> 01:38:45,500
Sir?

1111
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:48,083
Bebamma is missing.
Search for her.

1112
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:51,166
Bebamma...

1113
01:38:58,333 --> 01:38:59,541
-Hey!
-Sir?

1114
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:01,958
-No one else should know.
-Yes, sir.

1115
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:04,208
-Take the bicycles.
-Get the bicycles out.

1116
01:39:06,166 --> 01:39:07,291
Bring out the bicycle.

1117
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:28,958
Bebamma?

1118
01:39:29,458 --> 01:39:30,916
Come, Aasi. Let's go away.

1119
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,958
Where?

1120
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:34,291
Somewhere far away from here.
Come on.

1121
01:39:34,416 --> 01:39:35,250
No, I won't.

1122
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,458
They killed my dad right in front of me.

1123
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,958
It is still very fresh in my memory.

1124
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:45,000
I know this is not the appropriate
time to this.

1125
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:47,208
But if we miss moment,

1126
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:49,708
I will meet the same fate as your father.

1127
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,958
-Please, let's go.
-Let go of me.

1128
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:55,458
- Bebamma!
- Come with me, or I'll kill myself.

1129
01:39:55,541 --> 01:39:57,083
Please listen to me.

1130
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:59,125
I need to tell you something.

1131
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:03,458
Catch him!

1132
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:33,833
Aasi! Aasi...

1133
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:36,541
Aasi!

1134
01:40:39,083 --> 01:40:41,125
-Bebamma, let's go home.
-Let go of me.

1135
01:40:41,208 --> 01:40:43,208
Aasi! Aasi!

1136
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:47,166
Aasi!

1137
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:01,666
Come on.

1138
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,166
Come on, guys.

1139
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:50,541
Aasi!

1140
01:43:00,458 --> 01:43:01,541
Get on, Bebamma.

1141
01:43:02,291 --> 01:43:03,333
Get on.

1142
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:09,333
Aasi...

1143
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:22,958
Come, son.

1144
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:26,458
Brother, why are you sitting here
at the entrance?

1145
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:29,625
The priest said that my son must enter
your house before dawn.

1146
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:33,208
And it'll be inauspicious later.
That's why my son and I are here.

1147
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:35,041
The other relatives will soon follow.

1148
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,375
-What happened?
-Sir, well...

1149
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:44,750
Don't hesitate. Speak up.

1150
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:47,875
Bebamma escaped on the cargo train
going to Odisha.

1151
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:00,791
How dare you say that about the girl
who is getting engaged shortly?

1152
01:44:03,416 --> 01:44:05,333
-Govindu.
-Sir?

1153
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:07,666
-Go and check on her.
-Okay, sir.

1154
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:26,750
Sir, Bebamma is sleeping in her room.

1155
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,833
I switched the fan on.

1156
01:44:32,375 --> 01:44:34,083
-Govindu.
-Sir?

1157
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:38,000
From tomorrow onwards,
you must escort Bebamma to college.

1158
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:39,250
All right.

1159
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,750
She should continue buying her stationary

1160
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:44,750
from Ninety Prakash's store.

1161
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:48,125
Her clothes should be spic-and-span,
and well-ironed.

1162
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:49,166
All right, sir.

1163
01:44:49,291 --> 01:44:51,833
And the attendance registers
at her college

1164
01:44:52,208 --> 01:44:56,041
should always record that she is present.

1165
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:58,291
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

1166
01:44:59,375 --> 01:45:01,625
As for as the engagement is concerned,

1167
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
you can tell people
that planets are not aligned

1168
01:45:04,291 --> 01:45:06,416
or the scriptures do not ordain this,

1169
01:45:06,666 --> 01:45:09,166
or the girl is unable
to go through this now.

1170
01:45:09,708 --> 01:45:11,583
Use any excuse you will.

1171
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:14,625
But at the appointed time
fixed by the priest,

1172
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,916
my daughter will become
your daughter-in-law.

1173
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,958
{\an8}What do you say?

1174
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:22,708

1176
01:46:40,541 --> 01:46:42,166
What happened?

1177
01:46:43,458 --> 01:46:44,791
I saw my dad's men.

1178
01:46:48,333 --> 01:46:50,333

01:47:39,125 --> 01:47:40,041
Stop it.

1181
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:41,416
I need to get to work.

1182
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:47,916
-I'll pull down this towel.
-Do you have any sense?

1183
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:55,541
I'm sorry, Bebamma.
I was angry and yelled at you.

1184
01:47:55,625 --> 01:47:56,791
Let go of me.

1185
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,375
Please listen to me.

1186
01:47:59,208 --> 01:48:00,291
Bebamma.

1187
01:48:01,791 --> 01:48:03,541
I like you a lot.

1188
01:48:22,291 --> 01:48:24,916
Please let him go. I beg you.

1189
01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:28,375
Aasi! Aasi!

1190
01:48:29,666 --> 01:48:30,541
Aasi!

1191
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:36,833
Aasi?

1192
01:48:43,125 --> 01:48:44,625
Dad...

1193
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,000
Dad!

1194
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:02,708
Sir...

1195
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,833
Bebamma isn't in Kolkata either.

{\an8}GANGTOK

1197
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:18,666
Sit down, Bebamma.
I'll get you something to eat.

1198
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:19,708
All right.

1199
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:33,208
Bebamma?

1200
01:49:33,958 --> 01:49:34,916
Bebamma?

1201
01:49:41,583 --> 01:49:42,583
Bebamma!

1202
01:49:43,791 --> 01:49:45,000
Bebamma!

1203
01:49:46,708 --> 01:49:47,791
Aasi!

1204
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:58,375
How dare you touch Bebamma!

1205
01:50:00,208 --> 01:50:01,833
How dare you touch Bebamma!

1206
01:50:04,291 --> 01:50:07,208
She is my Bebamma.
How dare you touch Bebamma!

1207
01:50:10,666 --> 01:50:12,041
I will kill each one of you!

1208
01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:13,458
Rascals!

1209
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:19,333
Aasi!

1210
01:50:28,791 --> 01:50:29,750
Where to?

1211
01:50:29,833 --> 01:50:33,500
It's not safe for you to be out.
You saw what happened last night.

1212
01:50:33,583 --> 01:50:35,291
Let's look for a ladies hostel.

1213
01:50:37,875 --> 01:50:41,208
-Hostel?
-It's 3,000 rupees per month.

1214
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:51,083
Hundred rupees? Not possible.

1215
01:50:51,166 --> 01:50:53,000
-For one day.
-No. it's not possible.

1216
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:55,875
-Just one day.
-Pay the entire amount or leave.

1217
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:57,083
I beg you.

1218
01:50:58,125 --> 01:50:59,125
Aasi, please don't.

1219
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:01,000
Please, ma'am. Please.

1220
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:05,583
All right.

1221
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:08,250
You have to pay up in two days.

1222
01:51:11,791 --> 01:51:14,000
Aasi. Where will you stay?

1223
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,166
We need to pay 3,000 rupees.

1224
01:51:16,416 --> 01:51:17,458
I will be back.

1225
01:51:21,916 --> 01:51:25,041
Brother, it's been three months.

1226
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:27,083
I just came here to remind you.

1227
01:51:32,583 --> 01:51:34,416
We have another three months left.

1228
01:51:35,083 --> 01:51:35,916
Go home.

1229
01:52:04,166 --> 01:52:06,583
You have to pay 3000 rupees per month.

1230
01:52:09,208 --> 01:52:10,250
Bro...

1231
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:16,166
Thank you.

1232
01:52:17,666 --> 01:52:18,583
Take it.

1233
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:22,166
Your money.

1234
01:52:23,875 --> 01:52:24,875
Aasi!

1235
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:27,208
I paid the money for tomorrow as well.

1236
01:52:28,583 --> 01:52:29,500
How?

1237
01:52:29,583 --> 01:52:32,166
I've got a job.
They put me up in a room.

1238
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:33,541
You got a place?

1239
01:52:33,958 --> 01:52:35,583
Then, I can stay with you. Let's go.

1240
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:38,333
No, Bebamma.

1241
01:52:39,458 --> 01:52:41,250
I share that room with another guy.

1242
01:52:41,666 --> 01:52:42,708
Hello.

1243
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:45,125
Okay, I'll go now.

1244
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:12,125
If you toil day and night
like this, you will die.

1245
01:53:12,208 --> 01:53:13,333
What do you want?

1246
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:15,625
I want 3,000 rupees.

1247
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:18,458
Money.

1248
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:21,750
-It's very nice.
-Eat.

1249
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,291
I paid for the entire month.

1250
01:53:24,833 --> 01:53:26,500
You won't have any trouble.

1251
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:32,500
Aasi, when you were paying
for my hostel on a daily basis,

1252
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:35,166
I was hoping you will take me
away from here soon.

1253
01:53:36,541 --> 01:53:38,500
Now, I've to stay here an entire month.

1254
01:53:38,583 --> 01:53:39,791
What happened?

1255
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:43,750
Ever since we arrived here,
we've been living apart.

1256
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,125
Please understand the situation.

1257
01:53:47,583 --> 01:53:49,291
I need to take care of you.

1258
01:53:49,541 --> 01:53:51,625
How can I be with you all the time?

1259
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:55,333
Earlier, even when you were not around,

1260
01:53:55,916 --> 01:53:57,583
I still felt close to you.

1261
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,666
Now, I feel like we're drifting apart.

1262
01:54:03,541 --> 01:54:06,375
The love that's gotten us this far,

1263
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:07,875
I no longer feel that in you.

1264
01:54:07,958 --> 01:54:09,958
So, what do you want me to do?

1265
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:12,666
You came to me because
your family didn't love you.

1266
01:54:14,583 --> 01:54:17,166
If you don't find love in me,
why don't you go back home?

1267
01:54:19,708 --> 01:54:23,208
I cannot meet you like before.
I cannot sit with you and chat all day.

1268
01:54:23,625 --> 01:54:25,125
We can't just get married like that.

1269
01:54:25,541 --> 01:54:28,416
Life with me will be like this.
You can either stay or leave.

1270
01:54:31,791 --> 01:54:32,791
Take this money.

1271
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,500
You can leave if you want.

1272
01:54:37,708 --> 01:54:38,750
Aasi...

1273
01:54:42,916 --> 01:54:44,125
Hey, bro...

1274
01:54:47,583 --> 01:54:49,291
She says that she can't feel my love.

1275
01:54:49,375 --> 01:54:51,833
DO NOT LITTER HERE

1276
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:13,041
Are you crying over Aasi?

1277
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:25,541
Why don't you eat something?
Eat a little, dear.

1278
01:55:53,208 --> 01:55:54,083
Hello.

1279
01:56:20,833 --> 01:56:22,208
Aasi!

1280
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:46,291
Where were you all these days?

1281
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:49,791
How could you abandon me
just because I made some comments?

1282
01:56:50,416 --> 01:56:51,583
No, Bebamma.

1283
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,208
I had to go out of town
to make some extra money.

1284
01:56:54,625 --> 01:56:56,833
I want to stay with you wherever you go.

1285
01:56:57,125 --> 01:56:58,250
Let's go.

1286
01:56:58,916 --> 01:57:00,500
Please try to understand me.

1287
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:03,000
I won't listen to you anymore on this.

1288
01:57:03,083 --> 01:57:04,375
Please listen to me.

1289
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:05,833
I will not listen to you.

1290
01:57:11,041 --> 01:57:11,958
Bro.

1291
01:57:12,625 --> 01:57:14,125
-Greetings, sister.
-Greetings.

1292
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:15,791
She will stay with us from now.

1293
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:20,041
Welcome to our palace.

1294
01:57:20,125 --> 01:57:21,291
Please sit. Sit down.

1295
01:57:25,416 --> 01:57:28,041
Whom are you buying these for?
For her?

1296
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:30,708
Can you give us some privacy tonight,
Ruben?

1297
01:57:30,791 --> 01:57:32,458
Sure. All right.

1298
01:57:39,416 --> 01:57:41,000
Why did you bring flowers today?

1299
01:57:42,666 --> 01:57:43,666
Come closer.

1300
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:46,416
Let go of me.

1301
01:58:00,083 --> 01:58:01,916
Ruben might be back soon.

1302
01:58:02,083 --> 01:58:03,041
He won't come.

1303
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:05,458
I told him not to come.

1304
01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:35,208
Aasi.

1305
01:58:41,875 --> 01:58:44,083
We can't do it for the next three days.

1306
01:58:53,375 --> 01:58:54,333
What happened?

1307
01:58:56,625 --> 01:58:58,500
Are you upset about it?

1308
01:59:00,833 --> 01:59:01,875
Don't worry.

1309
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:04,375
You can still hug me.

1310
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:07,333
You can still kiss me.

1311
01:59:09,291 --> 01:59:12,375
And you can love me
to your heart's content.

1312
01:59:12,458 --> 01:59:13,666
Can I?

1313
01:59:26,583 --> 01:59:27,833
Bebamma. Hot water.

1314
01:59:27,916 --> 01:59:29,916
Okay. I'll soon prepare your meals.

1315
01:59:44,625 --> 01:59:46,125
Why are you cutting your nails?

1316
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:49,000
When you appear in my dream,
they might hurt you.

1317
02:00:23,625 --> 02:00:24,625
Bebamma!

1318
02:00:25,833 --> 02:00:26,875
Aasi!

1319
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:30,708
It's a small injury. Nothing to worry.

1320
02:00:32,666 --> 02:00:33,541
Aasi.

1321
02:00:34,041 --> 02:00:37,375
-Does it hurt?
-No, Bebamma. It's a small wound.

1322
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:49,458
-May I hold the baby once?
-Sure.

1323
02:01:05,166 --> 02:01:07,166
-Isn't he cute?
-Very cute.

1324
02:01:07,250 --> 02:01:09,083
Why don't you just marry me?

1325
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,041
Your father will come back to us
as our baby.

1326
02:01:12,125 --> 02:01:15,166
We shall name that baby after my dad.

1327
02:01:22,041 --> 02:01:23,500
We will get married in two days.

1328
02:01:25,041 --> 02:01:27,166
We'll marry in the Puri temple,
just as you wished.

1329
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,625
-Really? Tell me again.
-Let's get married.

1330
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:39,458
-Tell me again.
-We will get married in two days.

1331
02:01:45,375 --> 02:01:46,333
Hello?

1332
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:48,583
<i>Mom, how are you?</i>

1333
02:01:49,083 --> 02:01:51,083
I need to tell you something urgently.

1334
02:01:51,708 --> 02:01:53,333
Aasi and I are getting married.

1335
02:01:54,916 --> 02:01:56,333
<i>I am very happy.</i>

1336
02:01:56,416 --> 02:01:57,708
Our wedding is tomorrow.

1337
02:01:58,291 --> 02:01:59,666
<i>Take care, Mom.</i>

1338
02:02:08,375 --> 02:02:10,125
Bebamma, I will go and get the tickets.

1339
02:02:10,791 --> 02:02:11,875
Okay, go ahead.

1340
02:02:25,458 --> 02:02:26,541
Bebamma...

1341
02:02:26,791 --> 02:02:28,041
Aasi!

1342
02:02:30,583 --> 02:02:31,708
Bebamma!

1343
02:02:37,041 --> 02:02:38,250
Bebamma!

1344
02:02:52,083 --> 02:02:56,791
Bebamma!

1345
02:02:57,333 --> 02:02:59,458
<i>The depression in the Bay of Bengal</i>

1346
02:02:59,541 --> 02:03:03,541
<i>will lead to heavy rainfall,</i>
<i>and gusty winds for the next three days.</i>

1347
02:03:03,625 --> 02:03:06,375
<i>The government has warned</i>
<i>the fishermen</i>

1348
02:03:06,458 --> 02:03:09,333
<i>not to venture out into the sea</i>
<i>for fishing.</i>

1349
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:14,125
Eat.

1350
02:03:15,083 --> 02:03:16,125
Eat it.

1351
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:18,666
Bebamma. Eat it, dear.

1352
02:03:19,458 --> 02:03:20,416
Eat.

1353
02:03:27,791 --> 02:03:29,333
You're getting married in two days.

1354
02:03:29,708 --> 02:03:31,958
You must appear pretty to the guests.

1355
02:03:33,583 --> 02:03:34,416
Eat.

1356
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:38,958
Look at your eyes. They are sunken.

1357
02:03:39,791 --> 02:03:40,791
Eat.

1358
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:43,833
I left home when you wanted me
to get engaged.

1359
02:03:44,916 --> 02:03:47,083
What makes you think I will stay now?

1360
02:03:48,791 --> 02:03:50,875
I will run away
even if you get me married.

1361
02:03:53,166 --> 02:03:54,958
I want Aasi, Dad.

1362
02:03:56,583 --> 02:03:58,041
Why would I let you go?

1363
02:03:58,416 --> 02:04:00,375
I'm so fussy about my reputation.

1364
02:04:00,458 --> 02:04:03,000
I don't even like you traveling
with other villagers.

1365
02:04:03,208 --> 02:04:06,416
That's why I had arranged a special bus
to take you to college,

1366
02:04:06,833 --> 02:04:08,708
which is just 15 kilometers away.

1367
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:11,166
Even though you eloped,

1368
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:14,458
I made the entire village believe
that you were still here.

1369
02:04:14,958 --> 02:04:19,291
What makes you think I will keep quiet
if you just run away

1370
02:04:19,791 --> 02:04:21,291
and bring disrepute to me?

1371
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:27,291
You will get married
to the boy of my choice.

1372
02:04:27,375 --> 02:04:29,083
You will spend your life with him.

1373
02:04:29,166 --> 02:04:31,416
And you will bear his children.

1374
02:04:32,625 --> 02:04:33,583
Is that clear?

1375
02:04:38,083 --> 02:04:43,166
I don't know if a daughter is supposed
to say this to her father.

1376
02:04:43,416 --> 02:04:44,916
But I am going to tell you, Dad.

1377
02:04:49,416 --> 02:04:52,375
The first time I eloped with Aasi,

1378
02:04:53,541 --> 02:04:56,708
I slept with him.

1379
02:04:58,333 --> 02:04:59,541
Did you know that?

1380
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:10,250
I know that.

1381
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,666
I searched for you all these days
and I couldn't find you.

1382
02:05:17,125 --> 02:05:20,250
Do you know how I found you
just two days before the wedding?

1383
02:05:20,625 --> 02:05:22,708
I couldn't have found you myself.

1384
02:05:22,958 --> 02:05:24,666
I found you because he ditched you.

1385
02:05:24,958 --> 02:05:26,125
Useless fellow!

1386
02:05:26,666 --> 02:05:28,333
He phoned and told us

1387
02:05:28,416 --> 02:05:31,708
your whereabouts, including
the platform number at the station.

1388
02:05:33,125 --> 02:05:34,125
Bebamma

1389
02:05:34,208 --> 02:05:36,041
<i>will be on platform number 1,</i>

1390
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:38,125
at the Sivok Railway Station, Sikkim.

1391
02:05:40,750 --> 02:05:42,875
You can take her back with you
tomorrow morning.

1392
02:05:54,166 --> 02:05:56,250
It's a lie. This is a lie.

1393
02:05:56,916 --> 02:05:58,791
You are lying to me, Dad.

1394
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,750
Did you really sleep with him?

1395
02:06:04,625 --> 02:06:05,833
If you can honestly tell me

1396
02:06:05,916 --> 02:06:08,750
that you slept with him
at least once in the past six months,

1397
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:10,625
I'll let you go from here.

1398
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:23,125
Try to remember.

1399
02:06:26,958 --> 02:06:31,833
How could you think I would leave
him alone after he ruined my honor?

1400
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:36,458
Do you know what I did?

1401
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:47,125
Aasi!

1402
02:06:50,958 --> 02:06:52,041
Let him go!

1403
02:06:52,125 --> 02:06:53,166
-Aasi!
-Dad!

1404
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:55,375
Let him go! He will die.

1405
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:04,083
Mr. Rayanam...

1406
02:07:05,083 --> 02:07:06,625
They are killing him.

1407
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:07,875
Please save him.

1408
02:07:07,958 --> 02:07:09,458
They are killing him.

1409
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,083
Dad!

1410
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:18,708
Jalayya, both you and your son
have made a fool out of me.

1411
02:07:18,875 --> 02:07:19,833
Sir...

1412
02:07:20,666 --> 02:07:23,666
It was your son who took my daughter
to the sea.

1413
02:07:24,166 --> 02:07:27,583
And you cooked up a story
and said it was someone else.

1414
02:07:27,666 --> 02:07:29,041
Please forgive me, sir.

1415
02:07:29,458 --> 02:07:32,791
I made a mistake.
I did it to protect my son, sir.

1416
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:35,041
Forgive us.
We'll leave this place for good.

1417
02:07:35,125 --> 02:07:36,916
He's bleeding from those injuries.

1418
02:07:37,041 --> 02:07:38,208
Let him bleed.

1419
02:07:38,666 --> 02:07:42,666
Once you see all that blood spill,
you and your son will finally understand.

1420
02:07:44,041 --> 02:07:46,291
When human blood is transfused,

1421
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:50,083
unless it's from the same blood group,
the receiver would die.

1422
02:07:51,416 --> 02:07:55,791
Likewise, your son is not from my caste.
How could he fall in love with my daughter

1423
02:07:56,166 --> 02:07:58,833
and get away with his life?

1424
02:07:58,916 --> 02:08:01,208
You lower-caste bastard!

1425
02:08:01,291 --> 02:08:02,708
Please ask them to stop, sir!

1426
02:08:03,333 --> 02:08:07,291
Did your wife really sleep only with you
and gave birth to him?

1427
02:08:07,375 --> 02:08:08,333
Rayanam!

1428
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:10,375
Watch your tongue!

1429
02:08:10,666 --> 02:08:15,041
Your daughter spent an entire night
with my lower-caste son.

1430
02:08:15,125 --> 02:08:17,958
What is your daughter's caste?
What the hell is your caste?

1431
02:08:18,875 --> 02:08:19,958
How dare you!

1432
02:08:50,625 --> 02:08:53,791
Jalayya, you were right.

1433
02:08:54,125 --> 02:08:56,125
Caste is not an obstacle for love.

1434
02:09:02,333 --> 02:09:03,291
Rayanam...

1435
02:09:05,750 --> 02:09:07,208
Rayanam, let him go.

1436
02:09:07,916 --> 02:09:08,916
I beg you.

1437
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:09,875
Hey.

1438
02:09:11,833 --> 02:09:16,291
The only reason that my daughter fell
in love with you is because you are a man.

1439
02:09:17,958 --> 02:09:19,916
I'm not going to kill you.

1440
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:23,875
No...

1441
02:09:23,958 --> 02:09:26,041
Please, no...

1442
02:09:26,375 --> 02:09:29,750
I'm going to cut off the manhood
that my daughter has fallen for.

1443
02:09:36,125 --> 02:09:37,541
Aasi!

1444
02:09:41,791 --> 02:09:43,500
Please let him go, sir.
I beg you.

1445
02:09:44,125 --> 02:09:45,000
No!

1446
02:09:47,375 --> 02:09:49,000
Aasi!

1447
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,333
Hey.

1448
02:10:04,375 --> 02:10:07,375
You fell in love with my daughter,
yet I'm letting you live.

1449
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:10,750
Because, unable to make love anymore,
you will live miserably.

1450
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:25,666
<i>If love is so great,</i>

1451
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:28,416
<i>it belongs only</i>
<i>in graveyards and history books.</i>

1452
02:10:28,541 --> 02:10:30,500
<i>If it turns into love and begets a family,</i>

1453
02:10:30,583 --> 02:10:33,041
<i>it won't be great at all.</i>

1454
02:10:33,416 --> 02:10:36,916
<i>That's why love exists only in history.</i>

1455
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,833
<i>It doesn't have a future in society.</i>

1456
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,083
<i>What do you say?</i>

1457
02:10:50,250 --> 02:10:52,166
Come with me, or I will kill myself.

1458
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:54,541
Bebamma, I need to tell you something.

1459
02:10:54,666 --> 02:10:56,625
-I'm going to pull your towel.
-Hey!

1460
02:11:03,833 --> 02:11:06,208
<i>I didn't get you here</i>
<i>to live with you, Bebamma.</i>

1461
02:11:06,875 --> 02:11:09,750
<i>I brought you here so that</i>
<i>you learn to survive without me.</i>

1462
02:11:11,166 --> 02:11:14,208
<i>I did put some distance between us,</i>
<i>but I was always guarding you.</i>

1463
02:11:18,333 --> 02:11:19,875
<i>I didn't know how to tell you.</i>

1464
02:11:19,958 --> 02:11:21,916
<i>I wanted you to know the truth</i>
<i>at least today.</i>

1465
02:11:24,208 --> 02:11:25,958
<i>That's why I did this, Bebamma.</i>

1466
02:11:31,416 --> 02:11:33,083
Why don't you just marry me?

1467
02:11:33,166 --> 02:11:35,208
Your father will come back to us
as our baby.

1468
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:42,125
<i>I want you.</i>
<i>But I don't know how I can live with you.</i>

1469
02:11:42,333 --> 02:11:43,708
<i>If I made you stay with me,</i>

1470
02:11:43,791 --> 02:11:46,250
<i>would you call it love</i>
<i>or betrayal of your love?</i>

1471
02:11:46,333 --> 02:11:47,916
<i>I don't know.</i>

1472
02:11:48,416 --> 02:11:52,291
<i>But when you said you wanted to have kids,</i>
<i>I thought I was betraying your love.</i>

1473
02:11:52,375 --> 02:11:54,291
<i>That's why I'm sending you home, Bebamma.</i>

1474
02:12:58,041 --> 02:12:59,208
Kanakam!

1475
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,458
Get me some water.

1476
02:13:44,333 --> 02:13:46,166
-Govindu.
-Ma'am?

1477
02:13:56,791 --> 02:13:59,000
Can you do me a small favor?

1478
02:14:00,125 --> 02:14:01,708
-Sir...
-Go on.

1479
02:14:02,375 --> 02:14:03,375
What is it?

1480
02:14:03,875 --> 02:14:07,875
Can you take me to Aasi
wherever he is now?

1481
02:14:20,208 --> 02:14:21,458
Let go of my hand, Dad.

1482
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,375
Let go of my hand.

1483
02:14:26,291 --> 02:14:29,583
-He has nothing to give you.
-Let go of my hand.

1484
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,875
Let go of my hand, Dad!

1485
02:14:51,291 --> 02:14:53,291
I am getting angry.

1486
02:14:55,541 --> 02:14:57,291
I am going to get old soon.

1487
02:14:59,333 --> 02:15:01,875
Actually, I should be angry with you.

1488
02:15:03,291 --> 02:15:05,166
Even though you put him through hell,

1489
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:09,125
Aasi never told me the truth about you
and suffered in silence.

1490
02:15:09,208 --> 02:15:11,208
So, I'm angry with him too.

1491
02:15:11,916 --> 02:15:14,625
I am going to him,
and I'll grow old along with him.

1492
02:15:18,166 --> 02:15:19,750
I'm your daughter.

1493
02:15:19,833 --> 02:15:25,625
How could you even think that I went out
with Aasi just to sleep with him?

1494
02:15:30,916 --> 02:15:32,791
If I only went out to sleep with him,

1495
02:15:34,208 --> 02:15:36,625
I could've done that everyday
and got back home.

1496
02:15:41,916 --> 02:15:43,708
He loved me, Dad.

1497
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:47,750
What happened?

1498
02:15:52,333 --> 02:15:55,291
He took me to the sea
because I asked him to.

1499
02:15:57,250 --> 02:15:59,625
Because he couldn't give me
what I asked for,

1500
02:16:01,833 --> 02:16:03,541
he let you bring me home.

1501
02:16:04,958 --> 02:16:06,166
That is all there is.

1502
02:16:06,666 --> 02:16:07,916
Nothing else.

1503
02:16:12,083 --> 02:16:15,000
How can you or Aasi judge

1504
02:16:15,791 --> 02:16:18,541
who is a man and who is not?

1505
02:16:21,208 --> 02:16:23,291
As a girl, I should judge that.

1506
02:16:27,791 --> 02:16:31,416
You are asking me if I was with him
for the past six months.

1507
02:16:31,583 --> 02:16:33,083
Yes, I was, Dad.

1508
02:16:35,416 --> 02:16:36,625
And in all those days,

1509
02:16:36,708 --> 02:16:39,333
I never felt that I was missing something
in my life.

1510
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:47,208
Will any girl ever find a better man
than Aasi, Dad?

1511
02:16:54,291 --> 02:16:56,125
My teacher taught us something.

1512
02:16:56,458 --> 02:17:00,916
She said that manhood isn't something
that lies between thighs.

1513
02:17:01,416 --> 02:17:03,958
It exists in every nerve
and sinew of a man's body.

1514
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:09,666
Maybe that's why when Aasi
holds my hand, I begin to sweat.

1515
02:17:49,625 --> 02:17:51,875
Dad, love means holding on
to your beloved,

1516
02:17:52,291 --> 02:17:53,750
not letting them go.

1517
02:17:57,208 --> 02:18:00,041
How would you know anything about love?

1518
02:18:01,416 --> 02:18:03,250
Ever since Mom got bedridden,

1519
02:18:03,875 --> 02:18:06,250
if only you had held her hand
lovingly just once,

1520
02:18:06,416 --> 02:18:09,916
you would have felt
the difficulty of letting go.

1521
02:18:17,958 --> 02:18:20,583
How can I make you understand, Dad?

1522
02:18:24,125 --> 02:18:26,958
Aasi doesn't have to lie on top of me.

1523
02:18:33,666 --> 02:18:36,291
It's enough if he just lies down
besides me.

1524
02:18:42,125 --> 02:18:45,416
If you really thought
that I went to just sleep with him...

1525
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:49,750
I spent an entire night with him.

1526
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:54,625
That experience suffices
for the rest of my life.

1527
02:19:53,125 --> 02:19:54,958
I am going to live with Aasi.

1528
02:19:56,541 --> 02:19:58,041
Bless me, Dad.

1529
02:20:12,708 --> 02:20:13,625
Sir...

1530
02:20:14,375 --> 02:20:15,291
Bebamma...

1531
02:20:15,583 --> 02:20:17,500
Sir... Bebamma...

1532
02:20:18,208 --> 02:20:19,583
Sir, she is leaving.

1533
02:20:20,208 --> 02:20:21,666
Stop her.

1534
02:20:37,291 --> 02:20:38,291
Govindu!

1535
02:20:38,833 --> 02:20:40,958
When his daughter was talking back,

1536
02:20:41,041 --> 02:20:43,958
not even once could he come up
with a response.

1537
02:20:44,458 --> 02:20:46,041
Then why are you stopping her?

1538
02:20:46,541 --> 02:20:47,583
Let her go.

1539
02:21:08,375 --> 02:21:09,500
Don't worry.

1540
02:21:09,958 --> 02:21:11,458
You can still hug me.

1541
02:21:12,458 --> 02:21:14,166
<i>You can still kiss me.</i>

1542
02:21:14,791 --> 02:21:17,916
<i>And you can love me</i>
<i>to your heart's content.</i>

1543
02:21:53,250 --> 02:21:55,291
Did you let me go because I wanted kids?

1544
02:21:58,083 --> 02:22:00,791
If I want kids,
I want them with you, Aasi.

1545
02:22:01,208 --> 02:22:02,375
Not with someone else.

1546
02:22:03,083 --> 02:22:04,125
No, Bebamma.

1547
02:22:04,208 --> 02:22:05,083
Dear God,

1548
02:22:05,875 --> 02:22:07,208
please protect us.

1549
02:22:08,875 --> 02:22:09,875
Grandpa.

1550
02:22:10,125 --> 02:22:12,208
God is missing a hand.

1551
02:22:12,291 --> 02:22:14,583
Can He still bless us and grant us wishes?

1552
02:22:15,333 --> 02:22:17,541
The idol might be damaged,

1553
02:22:17,625 --> 02:22:19,708
but nothing can damage God, my dear.

1554
02:22:19,833 --> 02:22:21,458
The divinity is inside.

1555
02:22:21,541 --> 02:22:23,708
The external damage to the idol
doesn't matter.

1556
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:28,458
Love and divinity
never suffer from physical flaws.

1557
02:22:44,083 --> 02:22:45,083
Look.

1558
02:22:45,416 --> 02:22:48,333
See how I'm sweating
when you are beside me.

1559
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:58,416
<i>Even though Rayanam cut off</i>
<i>Aasi's manhood,</i>

1560
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:00,500
<i>he couldn't stop Aasi from being a man.</i>

1561
02:23:00,833 --> 02:23:02,458
<i>A person's heart is like an ocean.</i>

1562
02:23:02,666 --> 02:23:05,000
<i>And the love that is born there</i>
