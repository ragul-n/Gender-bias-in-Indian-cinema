00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,990
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,300
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,930
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

4
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,430
KARA TOYGAR
CARAVANSARY

5
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,160
Come closer, Gundogdu.

6
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,260
I can see the rage in your eyes.

7
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,160
Is that rage towards me or your father?

8
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,030
I do not like to lie about my feelings.

9
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,560
There is really no need for all these,
Gundogdu.

10
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:52,100
God forbid, if something happens
to your old father in the near future...

11
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,230
...wouldn’t it be better for you to lead
the Kayi tribe in the future?

12
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,130
If I were to become a Bey one day...

13
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,400
...I would skin you alive and
feed you to the dogs.

14
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,230
Interesting.

15
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,500
When I came to the tribe, I thought
the growling Ertugrul was the brave one.

16
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,830
But it is the other dog
who didn’t show his teeth then.

17
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,260
Bring him in!

18
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,030
Hamza.

19
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,830
I will give your father one last chance,
Gundogdu.

20
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,860
I will send your Alp,
Hamza to your father.

21
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,500
I will gently propose that he should
bring the prisoners alone tomorrow.

22
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,200
If he rejects my offer...

23
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,430
...first you, then the whole Kayi tribe
shall be slain by our swords.

24
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,000
I will do everything
a good intentioned commander would do.

25
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,830
This is all I can do.

26
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,530
Do you understand me?

27
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,900
Take them away to the prison!

28
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
The eyebrow is an arc...

29
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,900
...and the lashes are its arrows.

30
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,500
You must glance at your man in such a way
that you strike him right in the heart.

31
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,560
His eyes will not see any other woman.

32
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,830
Don’t put too much.
I don’t want to look like I am wounded.

33
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,030
Do not worry. You will be very beautiful.

34
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,330
Just like a Bey’s wife.

35
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,960
With your sparkling hair and rosy cheeks...

36
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,330
...you will glide like a swan
the whole night.

37
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,960
Everyone will be gazing at you.
But Ertugrul the most.

38
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,000
-Will he really gaze at me?
-Of course he will.

39
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,460
He won’t only gaze at you,
he will fall in love with you.

40
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,530
The whole world will know.

41
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,830
Children...

42
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,200
...once upon a time...

43
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,260
...long before we migrated here from
the lands of our forefathers...

44
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,600
...there was a devilish dragon that
slaughtered our people, raided our herds...

45
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,900
...and devoured our horses and jades.

46
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,330
The people were shivering in fright and
asking “is there a valiant Alp...

47
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,300
...who can save us from this monster?”

48
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,560
Our forefather Oguz cried out,
“yes, there is! There is!”

49
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,930
Of course he wasn’t like me.

50
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,830
Much taller and braver.

51
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:46,030
He took his bow, arrows, spear
and sword to set on the road.

52
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,830
You know your task.

53
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
Watch your manners, greet Ertugrul.

54
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,030
My Bey, may God bless you. It is thanks to you
that we won’t perish in the cold.

55
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,100
May your Alps always be behind you,
may you form a tribe with your daughter...

56
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,160
...make an army with your son,
may God bless you, always be our leader.

57
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,400
Amen.

58
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,460
Look at our tall Alp.
He is locked in again.

59
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,030
Oguz faced the dragon and said,
“look at me...

60
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,830
...with this sword, I will sabre you...

61
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,930
...so that the biggest piece remaining of you
will be your ears.”

62
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
The Alps shall do the sword dance
in honor of our new land.

63
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,260
Let our traditions live on!

64
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,230
Suleyman Shah protected you, as an honor.
As our customs command.

65
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,160
What about your customs? Does it include
seducing the son of a Bey...

66
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,360
...where you are a guest?

67
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,200
What are you saying?

68
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,530
I said my piece and you understood me well.

69
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,960
Stay away from Ertugrul.

70
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,260
Halime.

71
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,960
You are like an arrow which left the bow.
Do you intend to run away again?

72
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,560
So you heard the things that happened.

73
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,100
Yes, we tried to run away...

74
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,200
...but unfortunately we could not.
-Nobody wants you to go.

75
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,100
Guests are sacred for us.

76
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,160
This is our custom.

77
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,930
Ertugrul Bey.
We carry the dark clouds above our heads.

78
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,130
We should go, so that the dark clouds
above your tribe can disperse.

79
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,330
So, you would have been long gone
before I came back from Aleppo.

80
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,230
Never to be seen again.

81
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,100
It would hurt, my heart would break into pieces ...

82
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,930
...but they will never let go of us Ertugrul.

83
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,560
Who are they, Halime?

84
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,390
What do they want from you?

85
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,430
It is best if you don’t know
who we are, Ertugrul.

86
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,530
Bey, we caught a leper.

87
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,600
-Kill her, don’t let her live!
-Who are you, woman?

88
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,200
We caught her while she was pouring
something in the food cauldrons, my Bey.

89
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,400
Do you want to die?
What did you put in the cauldrons? Talk!

90
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,560
I have brought you greetings from
the Knights Templar, Ertugrul.

91
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,360
Put the cauldrons and
this woman in a pit and burn them all.

92
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,130
What do these Templars want from you?
You just told us this morning that they...

93
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,460
...tried to kill you in Aleppo, now they
try to spread their venom in our tribe.

94
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,400
Everything started with you saving
our guests from their hands.

95
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,160
What is this about?

96
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,060
The problem is deeper
than it seems, father.

97
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,160
I don’t think that
it only concerns Halime’s famiy.

98
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,900
The real reason they attack us must be
because we will be right at their border.

99
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,030
You don’t want to blame them but
our guests have a secret.

100
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,600
And this secret is very dangerous.

101
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,460
Of course they are our guests, we shall
treat them like visitors from God...

102
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,000
...but don’t think further, Ertugrul.

103
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,560
Father.

104
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,330
Ertugrul, son...

105
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,300
...you can’t have a tribe’s girl
from outside. Don’t you ever forget this.

106
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,930
Moreover, we would like to wed you with
our girl Gokce, in the soonest time.

107
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,400
We talked with your Mother Hayme.
I found it suitable as well.

108
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,530
Anyhow...

109
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,960
...the evil of the day should be preferred
over the goodness of the night.

110
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,260
Come for the morning meal, we will talk then.

111
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,230
-What makes your night a torture, son?
-Mother, what does my father say?

112
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,460
He says sister Gokce will be a wife to me.

113
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,130
Gokce is a daughter of a Bey.
She grew up in our hands.

114
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,030
We know her manners, her attitude,
her ancestors and all.

115
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,430
You know all these, mother but...

116
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,360
...do you know my heart?

117
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,960
Halime...

118
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,260
...is here today, gone tomorrow.

119
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,330
We do not know who they are.

120
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,300
They say that they are traders.
Your father does not object...

121
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,360
...but he knows that they are not traders.

122
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:50,500
They are guests sent by God, he says.
He does not dwell on what it may lead to.

123
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,560
If the promise to the forefathers
is the well being of the tribe...

124
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,200
...this means Gokce for you, no one else.

125
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,300
Mother, God took me to her with a gazelle.

126
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,930
How can I betray those beautiful eyes?

127
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,800
Those sweet words?

128
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,260
If I take heart one day to ask
if her heart is set on me...

129
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,460
...and she answers "my path is bound with yours"...

130
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,860
...how can I tell her to leave, mother?

131
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,900
Are you asleep?

132
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,260
I would give anything to close my eyes
for a moment.

133
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,160
I talked with Ertugrul.

134
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,430
The girl’s father is better. They would
leave before the tribe migrates.

135
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,800
My Bey...

136
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,530
...I offered Gokce as a name to you.
But I am not in peace.

137
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,330
Ertugrul’s heart is with the other girl.

138
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,400
An Alp’s heart is always
with his tribe, Hayme.

139
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,930
He is young, he is hasty,
his heart may overflow with feelings.

140
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,560
When the tribe migrates and the tents
are set, those feelings would dry up.

141
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,530
Come on.
May God give you a peaceful sleep.

142
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,200
What a blessed morning this is.

143
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,000
You can be rest assured now.
Be happy that your dreams will come true.

144
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,030
Suleyman Bey told Ertugrul
that you two should be wed.

145
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,200
I don’t know, sister. On one hand,
I could fly up to the clouds in happiness...

146
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,430
...but on the other hand there are dark clouds
that never leave.

147
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,060
Let out a big breath, get rid of
all the bad feelings inside you.

148
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,030
This job is done. When Gundogdu returns,
there is no turning back.

149
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,600
-Did not Ertugrul arrive yet?
-He did not, Bey. He must be in his tent.

150
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,460
-Sit.
-My girl Gokce...

151
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,900
...go at once and tell him to join the morning meal.

152
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,830
Ertugrul Bey?

153
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,300
Ertugrul Bey?

154
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,100
Come in, Gokce.

155
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,230
Suleyman Shah is asking for you
to join the morning meal, Ertugrul Bey.

156
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,900
Sister Gokce.

157
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,400
I am coming.

158
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,830
The agreement is done.

159
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,960
We will give El Aziz as many Alps
as he wants...

160
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,930
...and we'll pay the taxes. We approve the land
he has proposed to us.

161
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,430
Tomorrow morning leave early
in the morning, send him my regards.

162
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,930
Inform him that I shall pay him
a visit after we settle in our new land.

163
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,600
As you wish, father.

164
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,500
If God permits,
after we settle in our new land...

165
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,560
...we shall wed you and Gokce.

166
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,160
Well?

167
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,560
I want a grandson, Ertugrul.

168
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,400
Father?

169
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,900
With your permission...

170
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,500
Get up and drink some water.

171
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,160
-I need to see our Bey.
-Wait, let me inform him.

172
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,860
-Rahman, who is it at the door?
-Hamza arrived, my Bey.

173
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,400
-He wants to see you.
-Let him in immediately.

174
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,800
I hope it will lead to a good deed.

175
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,500
My Bey...

176
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,800
...Kara Toygar...

177
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,260
Kara Toygar ambushed the caravan.

178
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,600
-Kara Toygar?
-What are you saying, Alp?

179
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,400
-Where is Gundogdu?
-Where are the other Alps?

180
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,200
They all died, my Bey. All of them.

181
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,100
-Gundogdu Bey is imprisoned by Kara Toygar.
-What do you mean by imprisoned?

182
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,930
How can you leave your Bey? How?

183
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,160
Why did he let you go? What does
this snake called Kara Toygar want?

184
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,000
The guests Ertugrul Bey
brought to the tribe.

185
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,460
Kara Toygar wants them.

186
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,600
If you don’t give them by tomorrow...

187
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,960
...he will kill Gundogdu Bey.

188
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,330
These are all your doings!
Everything is your fault!

189
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,130
You brought those cursed people here
and all hell broke loose!

190
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,830
Selcan!

191
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,100
Selcan, come. Come here, my girl.

192
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,260
Rahman, send some trusted men
to bring back our bodies.

193
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,060
Take Hamza to a tent without being noticed.
Akcakoca should treat him.

194
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,830
I do not want anyone in the tribe to
learn what happened. And bring me Numan!

195
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,260
As you wish, my Bey!

196
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,900
Ertugrul.

197
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,530
Where is your manners? How can you enter
without seeking permission?

198
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,900
-Halime.
-Suleyman Shah awaits you in his tent.

199
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,800
Hurry up.

200
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,200
-Halime.
-Be quick.

201
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,560
Numan Effendi, what happened?

202
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,300
Do not worry, Afsin. There is no problem.

203
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,030
Father?

204
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Father?

205
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,160
Sister Halime, where are they taking
my Shahzada?

206
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,930
Suleyman Shah wanted to see him.

207
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,230
I knew it would end up like this.
I knew we would have to go through this.

208
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,900
If anything happens to Gundogdu...

209
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,200
...I will kill that girl and her family.
-Stop right there, girl, stop!

210
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,500
Wife of a Bey needs to be resilient.
Pull yourself together!

211
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,830
Here I am, my Bey. You called for me.

212
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,100
Come this way.

213
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,030
A messenger arrived this morning.

214
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,400
He told us that our caravan was ambushed
and our Alps were killed.

215
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,160
Kara Toygar, who did this,
has my son Gundogdu as a prisoner.

216
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,460
My Bey...

217
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,560
...how could one endure such misfortune.
May God give you patience.

218
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:19,000
I didn’t invite you here to share your blessings
or your grief. By being invited here...

219
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,600
...you must have understood what it is
they are asking in exchange to my captive son.

220
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,030
Now, I am going to ask you one question.

221
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,030
And I request a single answer from you.

222
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,900
Who are you?

223
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,600
It’s my husband’s life against the lives
of these suspicious people!

224
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,000
They killed so many Alps,
they took Gundogdu prisoner!

225
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Yet I tell you, there is something
they hide from us.

226
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,500
But I will find out what it is and make them pay for it!

227
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,160
Mountains handle the land and
Beys handle the customs, my girl.

228
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,460
What you speak of is Bey’s business.

229
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,930
Because of their curse,
is there a man left in the tribe, mother?

230
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,300
Go after her,
don’t let her make the matters worse.

231
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,300
My Bey, it is my duty to answer your question but...

232
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,960
...but you have to believe me...

233
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,560
...when I say I care for your safety
just as much as I care...

234
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,900
...for the safety of my family and myself.

235
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,100
My Bey, if I tell you who we are, believe me
we will face bigger disasters...

236
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,030
...then the ones we are facing now.

237
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,860
However...

238
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,230
...I owe you a life.

239
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,360
I am ready to sacrifice anything for you.

240
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,430
This includes my life
and my children’s as well.

241
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,530
I told you to give a single answer.
Only one!

242
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,160
I am...

243
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,200
...from the Great Seljuk Dynasty...

244
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,500
...Muzaffaraddin Dawud.

245
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,330
Muhiddin Masud Shah’s son.

246
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:29,000
I am the grandson of
Sultan Izzaddin Kilij Arslan.

247
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,430
I am a Seljuk Shahzada.

248
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,960
Halime!

249
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,300
Hear me well!

250
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,030
You will be sorry for the day you came here.

251
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,500
You will pay double the trouble
you caused for this tribe.

252
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,060
Do you understand me?
If I need to...

253
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,600
...I will end your lives myself,
without a blink of the eye!

254
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,200
Not so quick, Hatun.
Why are you attacking for like a raving mad dog?

255
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,200
Because of you, our caravan was raided,
our Alps were killed...

256
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,200
...that filth called Kara Toygar
holds my husband hostage!

257
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,800
If any harm comes to him, if I get hurt...

258
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,030
...then you will see what rave is!

259
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,200
Sister. That is enough.

260
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,130
Let us go.

261
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,330
We will not go, Gokce. They will.

262
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,560
Dead or alive.

263
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,530
-They will go!
-Selcan!

264
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,230
Behave yourself!

265
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,560
Take her out.

266
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:14,100
Whatever you heard from my daughter-in-law,
don’t mention it to anyone else.

267
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:25,000
Stay in your tent, as none of us know
what will come after this.

268
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,530
Do I have permission, sister Halime?

269
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,530
I heard it all.

270
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,200
This is not good at all.

271
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,000
What will we do, Afsin Bey?

272
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,860
Their bride threatened of killing us
if anything happened to her husband.

273
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,130
We will find a solution.

274
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,130
It seems that Suleyman Shah will not
announce the dead Alps.

275
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,930
No one knows what they can do
if others hear of it.

276
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,400
God forbid. I would never want anything to happen
to our Shahzadas or to Gundogdu.

277
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,260
What Kara Toygar has set his mind on is obvious.

278
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,960
In exchange for Gundogdu...

279
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,400
...he will request our Shahzadas.

280
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,400
Don’t leave your tent.
I will do whatever is needed.

281
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,000
With your permission.

282
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:11,060
We have grown tired of running for years.
I ran away from those who...

283
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,560
...threatened my state with me.

284
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,860
From the Templars, the Mongols. I ran away
from all those who want an uprising.

285
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:26,130
I ran away from those who pursue me
for the survival of my state.

286
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,130
And I ran away from my state so that
my dearest son Yigit would not be harmed.

287
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,960
My Bey...

288
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,400
...it has been years since
I have given up on my own life.

289
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,300
So this is the end,
it is time to put an end to all this.

290
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,400
Kara Toygar wants an exchange, father.

291
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,330
But even if we give him what he wants...

292
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,100
...he would kill you.

293
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,000
His fury for you will not ease
when he gets hold of the Shahzadas.

294
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,360
He will kill you and my brother as well.

295
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,600
You are right, my son.

296
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,600
First...

297
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,500
...we have to find a way
to save Gundogdu from him.

298
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,400
Not only my brother.
I would not hand you over to him, father.

299
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,230
If I attack with my Alps,
he would kill Gundogdu immediately.

300
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,860
Besides our tribe will never recover
after shedding so much blood.

301
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,600
We would fall apart.

302
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,530
First you have to convince him
to free my brother, father.

303
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,330
Then convince him to come out of his fort.

304
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,530
If he wants an exchange, we set the rules.

305
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,830
-Why would he free Gundogdu?
-He has to, father.

306
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,860
Why did the Templars
try to kill me in Aleppo?

307
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,200
Why did they send a leper woman
to poison the tribe?

308
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,600
Why were the Templars taking
the Shahzadas to Kara Toygar?

309
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,530
They wanted Kara Toygar to be appointed
to an important post in the palace.

310
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,230
They wanted him to serve them.

311
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,560
Kara Toygar is after the Shahzadas, father.
He would do anything to get them...

312
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,260
...we just need to know how to ask for it.

313
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,960
What if something goes wrong?

314
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,830
Then we all die, father.

315
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,430
But at least it will be an honorable death
with a sword in our hands.
