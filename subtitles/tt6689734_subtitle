1
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:42,176
Are you asleep?

2
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,212
This is Room No 565

3
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,445
Last two times, when I was unwell

4
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,237
I was in the same room

5
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,473
So, this is like
homecoming for me...

6
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:22,246
Poor bird!

7
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:27,181
See blood that oozed from its chest.

8
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,741
Likewise, let my blood too

9
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,541
Ooze onto this paper!

10
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,781
And, dipping my pen in it,

11
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,778
let me write this!

12
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:46,441
Should I call this
an autobiography?

13
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,045
I don't know!

14
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:56,712
Only as someone without any
burden of future can"

15
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,543
Let me write turning each word
into an act of endearment

16
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,441
As for me,
I'd like to call it poetry"

17
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:21,833
♪ 'In the Neermathalam blossom ♪
♪ When time dropped like dew' ♪

18
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:32,833
♪ 'Like Neelamabari raga ♪

00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:43,600

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:04,517
♪ 'When one relished butter by oneself ♪
♪ Like Neelamabari raga' ♪

22
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,732
Two days back, it had rained.

23
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:10,044
That's why Neermathalam (a variety
of pomegranate) has blossomed...

24
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,277
After the first rains,
The earth gives off a smell

25
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,073
The Neermathalam blooms then

26
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,774
But how would a Calcutta city
girl like you know all that?

27
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:22,345
Kamalea...(Kamal)

28
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,045
Kamalea...(Kamal)

29
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:26,011
Come here...

30
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,079
From morning,
you're roaming around in the compound!

31
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,573
Look at your hair, all messed up!

32
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,673
Grandma,
is there Neermathalam in Calcutta?

33
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,569
I haven't seen any

34
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,838
How do I know?

35
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,638
I have never been there...

36
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,637
Go and ask Bala...

37
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,804
I was asked to make an
earring for the girl...

38
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,173
Narayanan?

39
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:56,610
Balamani doesn't wear ornaments
But why deny it to the girl?

40
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,704
Look!
I want my kid to wear ornaments and all...

41
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,874
Half a sovereign will do...
- Okay.

42
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,210
You've any ornaments to melt?

43
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:09,609
I've some bits and pieces in my box
I'll bring them.

44
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,079
You know how to make
necklace and pendant?

45
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,178
Of course...

46
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:21,240
I'll make it in any fashion you like!

47
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,608
But you should ask your
dad to send the money...

48
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,769
Have you seen Goddess
at Chottanikkara?

49
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:28,845
No...

50
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,307
Ornaments all over her body!

51
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,040
What a grand sight!

52
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,666
Like that, you too should wear ornaments
In your ear, hands and neck...

53
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:40,013
Wear fashionable
bangles and necklaces

54
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,706
And stand at the door when your
dad arrives from Calcutta"

55
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,843
Then he will ask: who
is this princess?!

56
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,147
Will you make ornaments like
that of the goddess for me?

57
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,812
But where is the gold for that?

58
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,675
All given off to Gandhi!

59
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,008
Nalappat women had such a
lot of gold ornaments!

60
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:05,079
Do you know how many ornaments I made
For your aunt's marriage?

61
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,077
Everything was given
off to Gandhi"

62
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,973
Congress, it seem s!

63
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:17,079
Did Gandhi come to Guruvayoor
To pick the ornaments of women here?

64
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,971
I don't understand this!

65
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,973
Grand-uncle, why does
Gandhi need our ornaments?

66
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:32,846
Who told you?

67
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,379
Goldsmith Narayanan...

68
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,336
He is crazy

69
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,847
The women who took part
in freedom struggle

70
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,643
Donated it to Gandhi when
he came to Guruvayur

71
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,675
When you grow up, you
too should give

72
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,066
If Gandhi asks, will
you give anything?

73
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,569
Of course...

74
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,076
For India to achieve independence
We'll even sacrifice our lives...

75
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,314
Don't bother grand-uncle"
Come and bathe"

76
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,904
What if Gandhi asks for me?
Will you give me too?

77
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,777
No, we won't give you,
not even to the Mahatma

78
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:09,371
Even if Lord Guruvayuppan asks
for you, I won't give Kamala

79
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,337
It is poet Vallathol and
writer Kuttikrishna Marar

80
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,106
Please come...

81
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,476
Aren't you stepping down?
- No.

82
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,140
Some other time.

83
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,937
There is a meeting in Kozhikode...

84
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:37,876
I am already late"

85
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,211
I haven't seen you at
Kalamandalam lately?

86
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,472
Will drop in next week
- Ok, then"

87
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,237
Is Mukundaraja there?

88
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,244
Convey my regards.
- Sure.

89
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:53,905
From where did you get this guy?

90
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,206
There was a reception
for him at Kalamandalam

91
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,912
By the students...

92
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:04,113
Youngsters love him more than
Vallathol or Asan (senior poets)

93
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,006
Is Balamani here?

94
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,904
Balamaniamma, uncle is calling you...

95
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:22,911
Krishna,

96
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:26,014
They will be here for lunch
Inform the kitchen"

97
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,173
No, I will leave now

98
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,142
I've to go to Mangalodayam press
- Okay.

99
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,104
We'll meet some other time then...

100
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,977
When did you come?
- Just now

101
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,207
Do you know him?

102
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,146
I am not sure...

103
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:48,437
That poem youngsters
rave about - 'Ramanan',

104
00:13:49,033 --> 00:13:50,171
It is he who wrote it...

105
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,472
Changampuzha KrishnapillaL.

106
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,138
God! I haven't met him before...

107
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,374
But I've read 'Ramanan'

108
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:01,309
I too have read
most of your poems

109
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,312
Your new anthology is titled
'In the Way of Dharma'?

110
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:06,913
If it is there,
I'll buy it from Mangalodayam

111
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,037
No, I'll give you a copy...

112
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,111
Thanks

113
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,332
Jaanu, haven't you made
'Pappadam's for the kids?

114
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,311
Yes.

115
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,345
Kochutty...

116
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,271
Balamani's eldest
son, what's his name?

117
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,411
I have forgotten again"

118
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,538
You've asked me a hundred times!

119
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,112
Mohandas

120
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,640
And the younger one?

121
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,979
Shyam Sunder.
Don't you ask me again!

122
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,410
These fancy names don't
stay in my tongue"

123
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,413
You know my name?

124
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:50,513
Oh God! it was at the
tip of my tongue!

125
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:51,637
I forgot it.
- Papad?

126
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,543
No pappad for your servant.

127
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:57,242
Why do you call yourself 'servant'?
Say 'l'...

128
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,677
Then how come Valli is saying so?

129
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,474
Valli, that is how you
call yourself, isn't it?

130
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:07,099
Valli is a cherumi
woman (lower caste)

131
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,273
But you belong to upper caste

132
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,141
Which caste am I?

133
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:14,209
Don't teach kids
caste and religion!

134
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,345
Kamala belongs to
human caste, ok?

135
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,635
If lunch is ready, please serve

136
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,105
Marar too is joining us.

137
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:29,911
Kochutty...

138
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,702
VM Nair is here

139
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:39,280
When it got late,
I thought you may not come

140
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,505
Balamani said you
were coming yesterday

141
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:43,943
I had to stay back in Madras
For company work...

142
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,966
Where did you get down?
Shoranur or Thrissivaperur?

143
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,275
Thrissivaperur

144
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:56,506
Dad, here is my pendant
earring goldsmith made!

145
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,635
Good!

146
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,743
Aami says she is not
coming to Calcutta

147
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,311
Kids say such things

148
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:12,279
She has to join the
English school this year.

149
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,741
Two more weeks left before schools reopen...
- So what?

150
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,746
I've booked the tickets
for tomorrow

151
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:20,978
And I have an urgent meeting
in office on Monday

152
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:22,610
So, I have to go
tomorrow itself

153
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,370
Are you all right, Mohandas?

154
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:30,877
Yes, dad.

155
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:34,771
But it is boring here
I like Calcutta

156
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,203
Only Aami wants to stay back

157
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:42,576
She doesn't want to leave her grandma,
the servants and Punnayurkulam

158
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,836
So you are leaving tomorrow?

159
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,178
You will come only
during next vacation.

160
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,571
Lucky Valli

161
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,173
She doesn't have to go anywhere

162
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,474
How I wish I were born as Valli

163
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:05,210
It is the new car of Am bazheth!
Shining!

164
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,379
You want to take a ride?

165
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,677
Why don't you ask Balamani
to take you to Calcutta?

166
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,277
If I ask, they'll take me...

167
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,273
Then I can travel by train too...

168
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,445
Valli, I am leaving

169
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,807
Aami, come on!

170
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,941
Come back soon...

171
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,699
Bye, Grand-Uncle

172
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,678
See you...

173
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,211
Kamala...

174
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,778
Kamala...

175
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,177
Get Up...

176
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,838
Come on, get up...

177
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,243
Come and write...

178
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,613
I will die, Krishna

179
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:37,610
Am I not with you?

180
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,708
Nothing will happen

181
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,511
Come.

182
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,807
Write whatever comes
to your mind...

183
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,604
Go ahead and write...
I will sit beside you...

184
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,207
Come tomorrow.

185
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,578
Good evening mom.

186
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:58,142
Aami, go change your
dress and wash

187
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:16,035
Why do you look sad?

188
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,570
Why our skin is it so dark?

189
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,866
What kind of a question is that?

190
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:26,475
Some cruel god has smeared us with dirt
And sent us to earth.

191
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,271
But you are not so dark.

192
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,566
You should come and
see my class mates!

193
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:37,243
All very fair, with
golden hair and all...

194
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,541
But you are studying
in white man's school!

195
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:47,212
Brother says in our school
only some of us are dark-skinned!

196
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:49,410
What are you saying?

197
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:50,511
Nothing.

198
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:51,773
Nothing?

199
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,177
Will you teach me Bengali?

200
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:55,211
What?

201
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:57,110
She's asking if you'll
teach her Bengali...

202
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:04,379
- Had tea and snacks?
- Yes

203
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:07,235
- Where is Aami?
- With the servants.

204
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:11,206
Doesn't Tripura take bath?

205
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,108
She stinks

206
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,540
Like Punnayulkulam, we've
no ponds or canals here!

207
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,840
What about you?

208
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,813
I bathe on alternative
days in the bathroom

209
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:28,346
Look at the old Bengali
lecher ogling!

210
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:33,247
When I change dress, he peeks...

211
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:35,103
What did you say?

212
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,507
- Sabilal... - Yes.
- Cigar!

213
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,048
A British teacher is coming tomorrow
To teach Kamala English

214
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,146
Come on!
Answer my questions!

215
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,478
Who is the ruler
of British India?

216
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,211
Kamala!

217
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,205
Behave you rself!

218
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,576
Sorry Madam.
Please tell me a story.

219
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,006
I don't know stories.

220
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:38,211
Silly girl...

221
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,335
This teacher does not
know any stories!

222
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:45,173
Listen here...

223
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,038
Next question.
Who is the author of Julius Caesar?

224
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,338
Ma'am, do you know Lord Krishna?

225
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:53,411
Who is that?

226
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:56,004
Guruvayoorappan.
Lord Krishna.

227
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:07,410
Krishna, do you remember
when I saw you first?

228
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:35,507
Aami, what is this?

229
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,972
Come and sleep...

230
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,775
You still have fever!

231
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,110
It is morning!
You haven't left yet?

232
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,706
Better leave...
I've to get ready for school...

233
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:56,671
Go now, Krishna

234
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:57,812

Grandma, if I look at the Sun like Kunthi
Will I too get a child?

I don't think he'll come today

263
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:27,740
India is getting Independence today!

264
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,214
It's celebration in all the streets...

265
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:34,780

Victory to Mother India!

271
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,242
Freedom at midnight.

272
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,374
Just a few minutes left!

273
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,144
Nehru will deliver a
speech in Parliament

274
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,071
VM, is the radio working"?
- Yes.

275
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:08,413
In Calcutta and Punjab,
riots have broken out

276
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:12,340
Mahatmaji is not going to Delhi
But is staying back in Bengal

277
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:16,510
Partition dampened the
spirit of Independence!

278
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:21,575
People are running frantically
In any vehicle they can get into

279
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,740
Both from and to the East and West.

280
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:27,678
Long years ago,

281
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,247
we made a tryst with destiny.

282
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:35,049
And now the time comes when
we shall redeem our pledge,

283
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,704
not wholly or in full measure,

284
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,570
but very substantially.

285
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,374
At the stroke of the midnight hour,

286
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,377
when the world sleeps,

287
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,447
India will awake to life and freedom.

288
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,732
Close all the shops!

289
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:37,713
There is a riot in the other street!

290
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:38,973
There's rioting

291
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,035
Close the shops immediately!

292
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,410
How come you are here?

293
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,547
Hey, come inside...

294
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:08,412
Why did you come here?

295
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:10,441
Why didn't you come to teach?

296
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,670
You are all wet...

297
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:19,844
Won't you catch fever?

298
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:52,046
Why did you come in
the midst of riots?

299
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,404
All our people in this street
are leaving for Pakistan

300
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,310
Any moment, the riots
can spread here...

301
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:07,612
We'll do one thing

302
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,044
I will take you home...

303
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,070
Come!

304
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,337
Stop here...

305
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,572
Kamala, go home...

306
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,708
They must be looking for you!

307
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,878
Go!

308
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,878
Go!

309
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,578
Kamala

310
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:52,777
Today, I will leave for Dacca

311
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,943
I won't come back

312
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,276
We won't meet again

313
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:04,912
Be happy...

314
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,678
Go!

315
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:12,812
Let's go.

316
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:49,646
That young man,
who offered me the sweet of first love,

317
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,944
I never saw him again

318
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,338
Like a vague dream
I saw one night,

319
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:03,276
he left my life forever...

320
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:07,280
Madhavadas is from
Am bazheth, isn't it?

321
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,570
Am bazhath family is
richer than Nalappat

322
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,276
A rank holder from
Presidency College, Madras.

323
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,109
Now he is employed in Reserve Bank

324
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,212
What else do you need?

325
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,038
I agree with all that

326
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:23,808
But he is 20 years
older than Aami!

327
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,044
She is only 15...

328
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,978
Aami.

329
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,413
Do you know something?
you are getting married!

330
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:39,209
Now no need to go to
Ambazhath as a guest

331
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:41,070
You can very well stay there!

332
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:44,844
But he is old enough
to be her father!

333
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,232
So what?

334
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:50,010
Nalappat women are always married off
to intelligent and educated men!

335
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,272
It is not their age or
beauty that matters...

336
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,948
Why did Krishna love
Radha who was older?

337
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,603
Age and love...
Is there any relationship between them?

338
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:13,645
Is there not?

339
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,804
Anyone can love
anybody anytime

340
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,808
Isn't that a universal truth?

341
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,073
So, shall I love you, Krishna?

342
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,747
In all the seven worlds,
ls there any woman who doesn't love me?

343
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,647
I alone shall love my Krishna

344
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:11,013
It is very late

345
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,071
Kamala must be bored
waiting for you

346
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:14,212
Das, you may go

347
00:40:24,434 --> 00:40:26,471
Where to?
- To watch Kathakali

348
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,599
Don't go now...

349
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,578
Come in...

350
00:40:39,634 --> 00:40:41,671
It will go on till morning
You come...

351
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,235
Be cheerful Aami.

352
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,378
You are all right now.

353
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,376
Doctor said you'll be discharged
tomorrow or day after

354
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,241
We had to spend a lot
of money, isn't it?

355
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:36,604
We are not that rich...

356
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,970
You are writing
your autobiography

357
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:43,075
There'll be a lot of readers for
Madhavikkutty's autobiography.

358
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:45,270
Then we will get a lot of money...

359
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,778
"My story."

360
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,406
By Madhavikkutty.

361
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:57,773
What all has she written?

362
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,444
Is it all true?
Or is it all her fantasy?

363
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,438
Whatever it maybe,
There will be an explosion.

364
00:43:07,534 --> 00:43:08,633
Don't you think so?

365
00:43:08,634 --> 00:43:09,772
It should create one...

366
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:12,578
Our need now is to
increase circulation.

367
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:14,543
The rest is her problem!

368
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:27,484
"When a woman leaves her first man
And goes to another man's bed

369
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,213
It is not a joke or
something amoral

370
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:38,282
But it is a tragedy,
she is humiliated, and wounded"

371
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,173
I was always an orphan,

372
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,279
Spiritually and emotionally.

373
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,938
Though I loved my husband deeply

374
00:43:51,334 --> 00:43:54,543
He couldn't love me

375
00:43:55,634 --> 00:44:00,242
So far, I haven't yet met a man
who knows how to love...

376
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:01,945
Balamani

377
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:03,345
Balamani!

378
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,610
- Is VM Nair here?
- No.

379
00:44:07,734 --> 00:44:08,872
Father has gone to Kozhikode

380
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:10,345
Uncle, please come in...

381
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:13,669
When did you come?
- Two days back.

382
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,236
- Unni?
- He is in the Estate

383
00:44:16,967 --> 00:44:18,199
Is Balamani here?

384
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,178
- Yes...
- Call her...

385
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,345
- Uncle, be seated.
- Ok

386
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,802
 Balamani, Did you see this?

387
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,709
What all nonsense
has Kamala written?

388
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,305
We at Nalappat and Amabazhath; can we
raise our heads before the public again?

389
00:44:37,734 --> 00:44:39,771
She writes what she
is convinced about

390
00:44:40,234 --> 00:44:42,646
There's no point in
anyone questioning it!

391
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:46,412
So,

392
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,971
it has created a
furore back home!

393
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:51,675
Sankaran Uncle came here
and created a scene!

394
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:53,813
Ambazhath people are also upset.

395
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,472
What did mom say?

396
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,171
That you wrote what you
were convinced about.

397
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:01,678
Did father read it?
- Don't know...

398
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,978
Sulu,

399
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,938
what did you feel?

400
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,173
I can understand you, Aami

401
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:10,933
But, those who read
Madhavikkutty (Aami's pen name)

402
00:45:10,934 --> 00:45:12,572
May not think the same way...

403
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:15,541
But, can I get into
the readers' mind?

404
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:17,769
Let them read and enjoy!

405
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:22,245
What about Dasettan?

406
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,643
He knows me...

407
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,778
Aami.

408
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,946
Meet my friend, Purushottham

409
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,802
A well-known poet in Marathi

410
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,212
Please be seated

411
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:44,610
A writer from Kerala told him
about your 'My Story'

412
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:48,942
From then on, he's dying
to listen to it...

413
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,479
After coffee, please translate
And read it out for him

414
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,781
Let him also enjoy our
'bedroom secrets'.

415
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,510
Ask him to first learn Malayalam
And then read it and enjoy...

416
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:13,807
What did she say?

417
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,844
She said, you first
learn Malayalam

418
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,338
And then read her book

419
00:46:21,434 --> 00:46:22,606
That's Kamala Das.

420
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,507
I didn't say that to hurt you...

421
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,608
I just meant some fun.

422
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:42,971
I can't write lies...

423
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:48,243
Truth and lie - only because
you see with your own eyes!

424
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:50,211
I don't bother.

425
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,978
But...

426
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,776
That there is one Madhavikkutty
who lives only in her dreams

427
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,441
And another who lives with me is
The readers don't know that!

428
00:47:02,334 --> 00:47:03,779
They will see both as one...

429
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:07,775
Then I am not writing anymore

430
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,580
But I didn't interfere
in your writing

431
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:14,745
Sit here.

432
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:15,945
Sit.

433
00:47:18,234 --> 00:47:20,271
Come on, I am in a good mood...

434
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:25,870
Today, you have a special smell...

435
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,437
I have to write, Dasetta

436
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:16,448
- Take down the luggage
- Ok, sir...

437
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,279
This is our place
Get down...

438
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,278
Careful.

439
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,339
Having grown up in Calcutta; you won't
find it difficult to live in Bombay

440
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,779
Still, when I go to office
You will be left alone

441
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:36,977
- What will you do then?
- I will manage.

442
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,169
Now I've a small job

443
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,299
Soon, I'm getting a promotion.

444
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,974
Where do I keep it, sir?
- Till then, we've to make do with this.

445
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:53,012
Keep it there.

446
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,108
Do you know how to cook?

447
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,302
Then, you have to learn
it by yourself.

448
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,846
And also how to behave
to the husband in bed...

449
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:10,945
Ram lal,

450
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:12,445
Buy something to eat.

451
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,478
What shall I buy?

452
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,141
Chapathi, curry etc"

453
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:16,445
Okay sir.

454
00:49:22,134 --> 00:49:25,115
20 years' age difference is big

455
00:49:26,134 --> 00:49:28,273
15 years and 35 years"

456
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:33,110
I may not be able to
get down to your age

457
00:49:34,134 --> 00:49:35,135
But...

458
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:37,108
You should understand my needs

459
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,446
And rise up to my needs...

460
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:41,112
You should...

461
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,805
Aami, you are like a kid...

462
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,236
You don't know many things.

463
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,677
She'll teach you things.

464
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:23,945
Everything"

465
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:30,210
She is a prostitute
from the red street.

466
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,438
You may not have heard
of that place"

467
00:50:33,234 --> 00:50:34,770
She's Padmini, from Kochi...

468
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,938
I've work at the office

469
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:41,473
She'll leave after some time"

470
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,177
Many men come to me and leave...

471
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:02,111
After spending hours with them,
They pay only 5 or 10 bucks...

472
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,846
But, sir gave me 50 rupees for this!

473
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:06,745
Be seated!

474
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,777
In front of my husband

475
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,836
I've never felt lust

476
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:02,241
With him, my lust had
somehow disappeared

477
00:53:04,334 --> 00:53:06,405
After my husband
makes love to me,

478
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:14,252
I yearned for him to
hold me in his embrace

479
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:21,774
if only he had caressed my
face or touched my belly

480
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:29,742
I wouldn't have so severely
felt that sense of rejection...

481
00:53:44,934 --> 00:53:46,038
How is she?

482
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:48,306
The usual difficulties of first delivery

483
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,945
See he looks like his Dad!

00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,902
Aren't you returning to Bombay?

493
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:24,345
I should.

494
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,939
But Dasettan is too busy with work

495
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:30,175
It is months since he left!

496
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:31,972
Doesn't he feel
like seeing Monu?

497
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,608
Let him come whenever
he feels like

498
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:37,745
I am happy here

499
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,611
I even sometimes
forget I'm married

500
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,677
That's a nice feeling.

501
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:47,778
You are impossible!

502
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,308
I like this...

503
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,572
Lot of time to read,

504
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,974
Every month, I write
2 or 3 stories.

505
00:55:55,534 --> 00:55:56,808
You and your stories!

506
00:55:56,933 --> 00:55:59,277
I read one recently

507
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,741
You write so candidly!
I felt so embarrassed!

508
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,643
Why don't you write nice stories
like the poems mother writes?

509
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:10,279
Stories with social messages?
- Yes.

510
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:15,244
My grand uncle, Narayana Menon...

511
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,739
Have you read his 'The Empire of Sex'?

512
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,902
No... I don't read such things.

513
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,749
The blood that runs in my veins
it is not my mother's but of grand uncle...

514
00:56:27,334 --> 00:56:28,312
That's the problem...

515
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,672
Menu, don't cry...

516
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:41,411
Look at that.

517
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,772
I told you about him

518
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,277
My friend who stays with me...

519
00:56:54,533 --> 00:56:55,671
Stop here...

520
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,646
Oh god! What all
things I've left here?

521
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,499
Scoundrel!

522
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,241
Shameless wretch!

523
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:35,611
Get lost!

524
00:57:39,867 --> 00:57:41,574
I am shifting to another place

525
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,939
As you have come, I am out

526
00:57:55,700 --> 00:58:00,171
At that moment, I loathed all men

527
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:09,012
I understood all my dreams
about marriage were totally crumbling

528
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:17,750
Why couldn't I go back or leave Dasettan?

529
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:25,644
I began to withdraw more
and more into myself...

530
00:58:27,067 --> 00:58:30,810
The glow of my face
began to fade

531
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:38,180
Though I decided to commit
suicide several times

532
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,607
Why couldn't I gather
enough courage to do it?

533
00:58:47,767 --> 00:58:51,476
My husband didn't take
care of me at all

534
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:53,980
He began to look at me with hatred

535
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:59,572
He often told I was mad

536
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,775
I don't know what you want

537
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,404
I mean, what is wrong with you?

538
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:14,012
- Hi!
- Hi!

539
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,605
How are you?

540
00:59:16,067 --> 00:59:17,045
You look tired!

541
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:19,505
You too!

542
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:28,681
He didn't back away from the
relationship with his friend

543
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:34,843
They behaved like lovers,
even in front of me...

544
00:59:38,634 --> 00:59:42,776
Then, I despised my womanhood

545
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:51,475
I thought I was losing his love forever...

546
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,778
But...

547
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:57,141
I was loving him very deeply...

548
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:07,639
I thought of suicide again

549
01:01:04,967 --> 01:01:05,945
Kamala...

550
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,277
your life is not to end
like this tonight.

551
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,376
You've so many things to do...

552
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,344
These wounds will heal soon...

553
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:36,882
Tonight, we'll sit here
gazing at the moon...

554
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:42,407
Your mind is brimming with poetry now

555
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:44,812
Go ahead and write them

556
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,036
I will keep you company.

557
01:01:49,134 --> 01:01:53,048
Krishna, will you always
stay with me like this?

558
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,312
Please.

559
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,844
Das, you should give her more care

560
01:02:41,334 --> 01:02:43,280
She is very sensitive and emotional".

561
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,105
As she writes and paints,
it is quite natural".

562
01:02:47,867 --> 01:02:51,110
In her mind, reality and
fantasy are mixed up...

563
01:02:57,434 --> 01:02:59,277
For some time, stay
away from this atmosphere"

564
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,436
Better you find out another house.

565
01:03:02,267 --> 01:03:04,076
Then her mind will calm down...

604

Why are you always feeling unhappy?

605
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,573
Grandma, why at this midnight hour?

606
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,771
Why are you not coming to see me?

607
01:09:58,901 --> 01:09:59,879
Aami...

608
01:10:00,334 --> 01:10:01,711
What happened, Aami?

609
01:10:02,101 --> 01:10:03,079
What?

610
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:04,845
I saw it...

611
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:07,239
Grandma died...

612
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:08,579
Telegram.

613
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:26,779
For my childhood and adolescence

614
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,180
I am indebted to my grandma

615
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,181
Those nights I slept hugging her close

616
01:10:35,367 --> 01:10:38,610
The cool, soothing touch of her fingers.

617
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:42,847
If those were not there,
Aami would have been a weakling...

618
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:50,740
I didn't attend grandma's
funeral ceremonies

619
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:55,982
From that vacuum, and
from my insanity

620
01:10:56,934 --> 01:11:01,849
What saved me was Carlo's arrival...

621
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:09,179
Sit there my son

622
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,771
Take him...
- Give it a push...

623
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:14,142
What is this, man?

624
01:11:14,367 --> 01:11:15,345
Go!

625
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:26,173
Aami?

626
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:31,139
I mean, Kamala?
Kamala Das?

627
01:11:41,067 --> 01:11:42,808
Do you recognize me?

628
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,010
Your dearest pen friend Carlo.

629
01:11:52,367 --> 01:11:55,644
Carlo is son of an
Italian millionaire

630
01:11:57,667 --> 01:12:02,013
He used to write to me
constantly that he loved me

631
01:12:03,134 --> 01:12:05,375
A young man who was a little mad

632
01:12:07,634 --> 01:12:12,344
He came to know of Indian
culture from my letters

633
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:17,679
He came to India to
do research on it...

634
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,477
Who is Carlo to you, Kamala?

635
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:32,538
I don't know...

636
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:39,976
He tells his friends and parents
That I'm his fiancé...

637
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:45,046
He wants me to leave my husband and kids
And go with him...

638
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,411
What did you say?

639
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:51,044
I didn't say anything, Krishna

640
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,340
Do you love him?

641
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,313
Love is like the sea

642
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:02,244
It always rushes towards the shore...

643
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,578
Stop.

644
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:08,670
A bullock-cart for Chinnan!

645
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,380
I am transferred to Calcutta.

646
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:19,113
I'm leaving to Calcutta tomorrow.

647
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,640
Going to settle there.

648
01:13:21,934 --> 01:13:23,311
Then I'll miss you, Kamala.

649
01:13:23,634 --> 01:13:24,908
I'm coming with you.

650
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,178
No Carlo.

651
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,674
You go back to Italy.

652
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,966
And marry another girl

653
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:32,140
No! Never!
I can't do that.

654
01:13:33,634 --> 01:13:37,605
I don't know why!
Suddenly I felt bored with Carlo!

655
01:13:38,534 --> 01:13:41,947
I wanted him to leave the
country at the earliest.

656
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:47,878
Hey stop!

657
01:13:48,234 --> 01:13:50,214
Please let me go, Carlo.

658
01:13:50,334 --> 01:13:51,666
I'll catch fever if I get wet!

659
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:54,477
You must get fever and
you must die of fever.

660
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,939
So, you abandoned Carlo?

661
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:12,649
Your affections are
just infatuations?

662
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:17,172
I want to go to Calcutta

663
01:14:18,967 --> 01:14:21,208
I want to live with my
husband and children

664
01:14:22,634 --> 01:14:23,612
As you wish...

665
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:29,773
My dear Krishna,
will you abandon me?

666
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:33,611
Am I not always with you?

667
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:41,449
Then, why did you abandon Radha then
And go to Mathura?

668
01:14:42,334 --> 01:14:44,575
Why did you not keep your word?

669
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,604
Why didn't you return to see Radha?

670
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:54,575
That abandoned soul of Radha
Is there inside every woman

671
01:15:50,034 --> 01:15:53,846
A time when those dark clouds
drifted away from my mind...

672
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,912
I took good care of my husband

673
01:16:03,034 --> 01:16:06,481
I don't remember my mother
showing affection to me

674
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:11,138
But I loved my children a lot...

Lot of stories.

682
01:17:15,967 --> 01:17:19,938
With the publication of 'Summer

683
01:17:20,634 --> 01:17:23,137
A lot of admirers came in search of me...

684
01:17:45,934 --> 01:17:48,915
It was in a hospital in Kozhikode,

685
01:17:49,634 --> 01:17:51,910
when my father was working
in Mathrubhumi newspaper

686
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:54,704
That my third son was born...

687
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,778
During monsoon, when my mind was calm
On a night lashed with heavy rain...

688
01:18:01,234 --> 01:18:06,877
My son Jayasurya came
to give me company...

689
01:18:38,734 --> 01:18:43,683
Having come to Bombay,
how can I leave without meeting you?

690
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,207
Das will be late?

691

697
01:19:17,301 --> 01:19:19,406
All because of the popularity
of your 'My Story'

698
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,143
That there is no other
woman in world literature

699
01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:30,772
Who writes so openly about private life!

700
01:19:31,034 --> 01:19:32,980
Krish nan Nair, the critic wrote thus.

701
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:34,145
Did you read it?

702
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:37,914
Yes...He also wrote once that I was insane...

703
01:19:50,567 --> 01:19:53,013
I don't like the smell of cigarettes

704
01:19:55,134 --> 01:19:56,374
Das doesn't smoke?

705
01:19:57,067 --> 01:20:00,378
Each man has his own
smell, isn't it?

706
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,378
I'm sorry

707
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,580
When each issue comes out

708
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,382
Readers are anxious to know
who your next lover is...

709
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:26,174
The readers or you?

710
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,074
Who is not attracted by you?

711
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:34,175
Your beauty overwhelms your writing...

712
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,879
You have such charm

713
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,306
'My Story' - I am stopping it...

714
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:44,379
I am not writing it anymore

715
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,304
You can stop it
after publishing whatever I've sent you...

716
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,876
Kamala, I know you
are not serious...

717
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:56,441
I am serious!

718
01:20:57,367 --> 01:21:01,838
The readers only want to know
how many lovers Madhavikkutty has!

719
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:03,278
Right?

720
01:21:03,467 --> 01:21:07,472
If you want your name too
to be included in the list,

721
01:21:08,067 --> 01:21:09,774
Forget it!

722
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:25,845
Look!

723
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,313
When My Story got discontinued for a week,
A flood of letters from the readers!

724
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:32,113
Shall I speak to her?

725
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:34,272
No... that won't do...

726
01:21:34,367 --> 01:21:36,278
If she wants to
stop, let it be...

727
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:38,710
Let her not think she
can overpower us!

728
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:41,807
Our magazine is not going to shut
down because 'My Story' is not there!

729
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:43,802
You do one thing

730
01:21:43,867 --> 01:21:45,505
That novel 'Madness' by Pam man

731
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,543
Start serializing it!

732
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:49,872
And send all these to her!

733
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,406
Let her have her fill...

734
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,677
To dear Madhavikkutty,

735
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,704
Why did you stop your 
'My Story' all of a sudden?

736
01:22:04,401 --> 01:22:06,403
I felt really sad

737
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,706
You disappointed
so many readers

738
01:22:13,334 --> 01:22:16,338
I won't read that weekly
without 'My Story',

739
01:22:16,634 --> 01:22:18,238
I felt so sad

740
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,808
I don't even get sleep at night.

741
01:22:21,334 --> 01:22:24,611
It had affected my life so deeply...

742
01:22:33,167 --> 01:22:35,374
I am a boy of 18 years

743
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:41,344
One night, lying on my bed,
I was reading your book 'My Story'

744
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,642
Unexpectedly my father entered...

745
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:48,341
Seeing me reading your book, he got wild

746
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,577
Saying you are an immoral
person, a libertine,

747
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:56,546
And a witch out to spoil the youth,

748
01:22:56,701 --> 01:22:58,681
He forcibly took away
the book from me...

749
01:22:59,534 --> 01:23:04,210
Some days later, when
I went to his room

750
01:23:04,567 --> 01:23:08,208
I saw him reading your book!

751
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:10,647
The moment he knew I saw him

752
01:23:10,867 --> 01:23:14,781
My father, the big moralist,
was embarrassed...

753
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,439
Maybe due to false pride
or unable to face me

754
01:23:19,501 --> 01:23:22,311
The next day, my father committed suicide

755
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:32,751
When I saw my mother weeping, without a
clue as to why he died, I despised you...

756
01:23:33,201 --> 01:23:36,148
I am writing this letter
with all that despise...

757
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,512
Take it easy, Aami.
It was his fate! What can we do about it?

758
01:24:05,834 --> 01:24:08,872
Madhavikutty, the writer is
In the minds of thousands of readers

759
01:24:08,934 --> 01:24:11,005
As a strong woman...

760
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,836
And look at you!
What is this?

761
01:24:15,901 --> 01:24:16,979
Come on!
Leave it.

762
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:19,476
You write what you feel like...

763
01:24:19,801 --> 01:24:21,007
And we get money for that.

764
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:23,471
The readers are fools...
You don't care about that.

765
01:24:26,601 --> 01:24:31,601
When I say I am the husband of Kamaladas
who wrote Summer in Calcutta <i>&</i> The Sirens,

766
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,713
The North Indians here respect me a lot...

767
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:36,907
l'm proud of you, Aami...

768
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,173
Why don't you feel
hatred towards me?

769
01:24:40,467 --> 01:24:41,545
For what?

770
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:44,106
Madhavikkutty, the writer,
is a stranger to me...

771
01:24:44,867 --> 01:24:49,612
I only know the mother of my three kids,
Aami, from Nalappat...

772
01:25:02,434 --> 01:25:03,970
Is Madhavikkutty here?
- Who is it?

773
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:07,011
You won't know
I am a school teacher from the South...

774
01:25:08,434 --> 01:25:09,606
Can I meet her?

775
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,472
I am Sudhakaran, a Mathematics
teacher in a government school

776
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,377
This is my wife, also
mother of my two kids

777
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,671
She teaches Malayalam
in the same school

778
01:25:32,101 --> 01:25:34,980
Her name... you need not know that.

779
01:25:36,934 --> 01:25:39,039
Before 'My Story' came out,

780
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,512
She never wore ornaments.

781
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,548
She was an ordinary honourable housewife,
obedient and demure...

782
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,666
Now look at her!

783
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:49,045
A big bindi... and ornaments all over!

784
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,602
Just like you!

785
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:56,446
She must have read your
book a hundred times!

786
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:59,044
More times than she read Ramayana!

787
01:25:59,167 --> 01:26:00,805
She knows every page by heart!

788
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,470
Now, she doesn't want me

789
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:06,812
She says she is an
object of lust for me!

790
01:26:09,634 --> 01:26:10,977
You are mad!

791
01:26:11,067 --> 01:26:13,013
Now my wife too got infected with it

792
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,641
I came here with her to
tell that to your face!

793
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:19,939
Come!

794
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,178
Hey!

795
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,472
I am so happy to see you in person!

796
01:26:33,001 --> 01:26:35,948
It is not mere admiration

797
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:40,271
In my thought and mind,
I too am a Madhavikkutty!

798
01:26:41,934 --> 01:26:46,212
In both of us, there is a woman
who yearns for love all the time...

799
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:50,246
So, we will go in search of a man
who can give us love, isn't it?

800
01:26:52,067 --> 01:26:55,776
After all this,
why haven't you left Dasettan yet?

801
01:26:57,301 --> 01:26:58,871
After what all?

802
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:02,714
Who told you I wanted
to leave my Dasettan?

803
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,711
I am not just writing life

804
01:27:06,034 --> 01:27:08,139
There is also something
like imagination in it...

805
01:27:08,801 --> 01:27:10,747
Madhavikutty will write
all sorts of things.

806
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:15,204
Here comes an admirer!

807
01:27:15,734 --> 01:27:17,736
Go, go with your husband

808
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:20,946
Go home and burn 'My Story'

809
01:27:21,367 --> 01:27:23,938
You teach Malayalam
in school, isn't it?

810
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:27,479
Go to school and teach the kids
The poetry of Ezhuthachan and Asan...

811
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:59,914
Wherever Dasettan was transferred to
Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Colombo...

812
01:28:00,101 --> 01:28:04,709
I spent a long period
of my life and writing

813
01:28:05,934 --> 01:28:11,213
In the early 80s, when Dasettan retired,

814
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,413
we shifted to Thiruvananthapuram.

815
01:28:24,267 --> 01:28:25,439
Take it inside.

816
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,547
- Shodu, you want coffee?
- No, Mom.

817
01:28:32,734 --> 01:28:35,044
- The phone is not ok yet?
- No.

818
01:28:35,467 --> 01:28:38,971
Once it is ok,
Book trunk calls to Chinnu and Monu

819
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,080
Let us keep the books upstairs.

820
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,137
This shelf won't fit in there

821
01:28:47,567 --> 01:28:48,671
We'll order a new shelf

822
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,545
Till then, let the books be here...

823
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,707
The room upstairs is
ideal for you to write...

824
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:55,544
If you open the windows, there is wind...

825
01:28:55,801 --> 01:28:59,339
Not only that, in Thiruvananthapuram
You will have a lot of visitors.

826
01:29:00,434 --> 01:29:03,176
Come down only if it
is really urgent.

827
01:29:04,034 --> 01:29:05,274
What about you?

828
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:06,578
Me?

829
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:09,410
I'm not going to write
stories anyway!

830
01:29:10,234 --> 01:29:12,111
I came here to relax

831
01:29:12,267 --> 01:29:15,646
If you sit doing nothing,
you'll grow old fast.

832
01:29:16,134 --> 01:29:17,112
Am I not old now?

833
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:22,242
We are still 20 years apart
That has not reduced...

834
01:29:24,167 --> 01:29:28,047
Rest of our lives,
I'll be your guard

835
01:29:28,501 --> 01:29:32,244
Let history record Madhavadas
retired life that way...

836
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,037
Some school kids
have come to see you

837
01:29:39,634 --> 01:29:40,612
Go.

838
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,778
Namaste.

839
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:55,114
We are from Cotton Hill School

840
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:58,304
We read that you've moved
to Thiruvananthapuram

841
01:30:01,767 --> 01:30:04,714
The students wanted
to meet you...

842
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:08,411
So you teachers didn't want it?

843
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,537
No, we too wanted

844
01:30:11,134 --> 01:30:14,081
Please come for our
School Day for a speech.

845
01:30:14,134 --> 01:30:18,708
Oh, no! I've just come here...
I am not ready for it now.

846
01:30:19,034 --> 01:30:20,570
Not now... it is next month...

847
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:23,976
Madam, please.
It's a great desire of ours...

848
01:30:24,534 --> 01:30:28,099
But have any of you
read my stories?

849
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,272
I have...

850
01:30:29,734 --> 01:30:30,712
Which one?

851
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:34,271
'The Ghee sweet dish'...
Then, 'The Smell of Bird'...

852
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,080
I have read 'Raja's Love'...

853
01:30:38,201 --> 01:30:39,179
Really!

854
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:41,766
When I took 'My Story' from our library

855
01:30:41,767 --> 01:30:45,146
Miss took it back saying
it was not for kids...

856
01:30:45,701 --> 01:30:47,612
Because they are small kids!

857
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:50,545
Then why did you buy it for your library...

858
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,041
That vulgar book?

859
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,012
I am a farmer, in Wayanad...

860
01:31:00,967 --> 01:31:06,440
After MA, she wanted to study journalism
So, I enrolled her here...

861
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,571
Not that I can afford it...

862
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:11,407
But it is her wish...

863
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:13,278
I write a little

864
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:17,008
Some of my poems have
been published...

865
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,340
My anthology. of 30 poems...

866
01:31:25,334 --> 01:31:27,541
I came here to seek
your blessings

867
01:31:28,434 --> 01:31:31,677
Not mine, you need
god's blessings

868
01:31:32,034 --> 01:31:33,308
I wish you all the best.

869
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:41,348
Why are you so lean?

870
01:31:41,567 --> 01:31:43,342
Don't you eat?

871
01:31:43,401 --> 01:31:46,075
Not much...

872
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,304
At this age, girls should eat well...

873
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,938
People say, hunger inspires poetry"
That's nonsense...

874
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,380
- Staying in hostel?
- Yes.

875
01:31:59,001 --> 01:32:01,379
Must be costly, isn't it?
- Yes.

876
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:07,539
Keep this

877
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:08,702
Oh, no...

878
01:32:08,867 --> 01:32:10,278
Keep it, dear

879
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:11,545
No...

880
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:12,701
It is ok...

881
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,043
Keep it.

882
01:32:18,067 --> 01:32:20,843
It is my pleasure, keep it...

883
01:32:21,867 --> 01:32:23,039
Ok, then"

884
01:32:24,801 --> 01:32:25,779
Go...

885
01:32:30,067 --> 01:32:31,068
Listen"

886
01:32:33,034 --> 01:32:35,446
Kamala is a bit
forgetful these days"

887
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:39,079
What she gave you is actually fake jewellery

888
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,674
In case you try to sell or pawn
It will be a shame for all...

889
01:32:48,367 --> 01:32:49,505
So, please return it...

890
01:32:57,367 --> 01:32:59,005
Keep this...

891
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,646
Keep this...

892
01:33:03,034 --> 01:33:04,112
My blessings!

893
01:33:14,767 --> 01:33:17,771
Aami loves everyone,
sympathy with all...

894
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:19,140
All for good

895
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,303
But if you give away things to everyone

896
01:33:22,767 --> 01:33:25,213
You will have to beg in the end...

897
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:29,009
She was a poor girl...
- Maybe

898
01:33:29,367 --> 01:33:30,445
You too are poor...

899
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:32,173
That's my problem...

900
01:33:40,034 --> 01:33:44,574
Your long-time absence here
Is a huge loss for Kerala culture.

901
01:33:44,667 --> 01:33:45,866
Don't worry about that.

902
01:33:45,867 --> 01:33:51,010
Now that you are here, you should actively
involve in the cultural and social front...

903
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,341
I won't have time for all that.

904
01:33:53,867 --> 01:33:55,278
I've enough to write...

905
01:33:55,634 --> 01:33:59,582
But civil society here needs a legendary
personality like Madhavikkutty"

906
01:34:01,034 --> 01:34:06,006
If civil society takes me over fully
what will Dasettan and my kids do?

907
01:34:06,067 --> 01:34:12,211
For long, our organization has been working
Above party politics, In the cultural front

908
01:34:12,401 --> 01:34:17,077
We've thousands of members
here and all over Kerala

909
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:22,810
If you can lead it, we can develop it
Into an alternative political movement

910
01:34:23,934 --> 01:34:26,866
I am not interested
in politics.

911
01:34:26,867 --> 01:34:29,905
Don't say that. You just lend your
name, and we will do the rest...

912
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,675
For the next parliamentary elections
You should contest from here...

913
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:35,179
Is it...

914
01:34:35,367 --> 01:34:37,745
If it is not a bother,
please come another day...

915
01:34:38,234 --> 01:34:40,043
Aami is feeling tired.

916
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:43,842
Doctor has prescribed
rest after lunch...

917
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:52,843
Please reconsider our proposal

918
01:35:00,334 --> 01:35:03,315
Aami, think about it really well

919
01:35:03,834 --> 01:35:05,973
Politics is not
like writing stories.

920
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,647
But they are pressurizing me...

921
01:35:09,867 --> 01:35:11,278
They will say all
sorts of things

922
01:35:11,867 --> 01:35:15,212
They will keep you in the front
And get their things done...

923
01:35:15,267 --> 01:35:19,181
I don't think so
They are good people...

924
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:22,678
You are too innocent!

925
01:35:24,034 --> 01:35:25,672
Why are you silent?

926
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,977
I know nothing about politics.

927
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,270
You are a public figure

928
01:35:29,401 --> 01:35:31,642
If you contest,
make sure you win...

929
01:35:32,767 --> 01:35:34,269
Unni, say something

930
01:35:34,634 --> 01:35:36,238
Not like what Sulu is saying

931
01:35:37,834 --> 01:35:39,108
It is Lok Seva Party

932
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:42,511
Are you capable of running
a political party?

933
01:35:43,267 --> 01:35:46,680
It is not me...
They'll take care of all that!

934
01:35:47,601 --> 01:35:49,979
Do you have any objection?

935
01:35:50,067 --> 01:35:53,378
If you decide something
No point in anyone else opposing it...

936
01:35:55,501 --> 01:35:57,310
Dasettan has no objection

937
01:35:57,967 --> 01:36:01,039
Monu and Chinnan also agreed
Shodu too...

938
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,633
Did you tell mother?
- No.

939
01:36:05,634 --> 01:36:08,513
What is the ruckus all about?

940
01:36:09,367 --> 01:36:10,607
Nothing

941
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:13,443
just enjoying our
time together

942
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,106
Next week, aren't you coming to
Thiruvananthapuram to receive an award?

943
01:36:18,334 --> 01:36:21,315
After that, stay with
me for a few days

944
01:36:21,634 --> 01:36:24,012
But you are too busy...

945
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:26,244
Now you're contesting
in the elections too...!

946
01:36:27,101 --> 01:36:28,944
But who told you?

947
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:31,571
I too live in this country...

948
01:36:33,334 --> 01:36:35,575
My dear Malayalee friends

949
01:36:36,367 --> 01:36:42,010
I believe you all know
Madhavikkutty, the writer

950
01:36:42,367 --> 01:36:47,214
But now I am standing before you
In another role...

951
01:36:47,634 --> 01:36:54,108
From now on, I wish to live
Amidst you, as one among you

952
01:36:54,367 --> 01:36:58,577
The only reason why I became
A candidate in this election.

953
01:36:59,434 --> 01:37:01,311
I am not a politician

954
01:37:01,667 --> 01:37:04,307
I also don't know
their language"

955
01:37:04,567 --> 01:37:07,446
What I want to say I
will say truthfully...

956
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,266
The Darling of Malayalees
The Dear Daughter of Kerala, Madhavikkutty

957
01:37:11,267 --> 01:37:16,979
Please cast your valuable votes
In the symbol of Rising Sun...

958
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,411
Election News continues.

959
01:37:22,934 --> 01:37:25,278
In Thiruvananthapuram
parliamentary constituency

960
01:37:25,501 --> 01:37:28,277
Congress candidate A Charles wins...

961
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:37,144
He defeated Neelalohitadas Nadar
of Left Front by 53,438 votes

962
01:37:37,501 --> 01:37:42,501
Charles got 2,59,791 votes

963
01:37:42,526 --> 01:37:47,525
Neelalohithadasan Nadar
got 1,86,353 votes

964
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:53,479
Eminent writer Madhavikkutty
who was also a candidate

965
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:58,013
Lost miserably and lost her deposit...

966
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:05,509
An independent candidate, she
received only 1786 votes

967
01:38:07,034 --> 01:38:09,947
Mom, that chapter is over...

968
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:13,477
But Aami will not be demoralised
by this, isn't it, dad?

969
01:38:17,967 --> 01:38:20,413
Mom! Take this in your stride, Mom...

970
01:38:23,734 --> 01:38:26,408
Look at him laughing!

971
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:32,738
I am only sad that I lost the deposit

972
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,906
It was Dasettan's pension money

973
01:38:37,434 --> 01:38:39,505
I could've at least bought some books!

974
01:38:40,234 --> 01:38:42,180
Or a silk saree!

975
01:38:44,801 --> 01:38:50,877
There must be at least 2 Lakhs readers
of my stories In Thiruvananthapuram

976
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:55,647
Also, thousands of women
who love Madhavikkutty.

977
01:38:56,567 --> 01:39:01,607
If even half of them voted for me
I'd get a majority of over 50,000

978
01:39:02,467 --> 01:39:05,676
That gentleman who repeated these

979
01:39:06,634 --> 01:39:09,513
Shodu, is he around?

980
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:15,079
Here he goes

981
01:39:15,667 --> 01:39:16,745
Good...

982
01:39:19,934 --> 01:39:23,472
Chinna, pick the phone...
Must be someone calling to congratulate.

983
01:39:29,933 --> 01:39:31,571
It's okay, my brave heart.

984
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:34,908
Mom, great news!

985
01:39:35,234 --> 01:39:38,772
You have been nominated from India for
Nobel Prize, for your collection of poems.

986
01:39:38,867 --> 01:39:40,312
Really?
- Yes.

987
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:42,640
That is great!

988
01:39:42,934 --> 01:39:43,912
Yes.

989
01:39:57,634 --> 01:40:02,913
It is for the first time that a writer
From Kerala is nominated for Nobel Prize!

990
01:40:03,201 --> 01:40:04,441
What do you feel?

991
01:40:05,467 --> 01:40:08,243
What is there to ask?

992
01:40:08,667 --> 01:40:10,544
I should be happy, isn't it?

993
01:40:10,934 --> 01:40:13,881
Not like hanging myself...

994
01:40:15,834 --> 01:40:19,611
Did you feel so,
when you were defeated in elections?

995
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,270
What's your name?

996
01:40:26,567 --> 01:40:29,605
Kamala-ji, how many men
have you loved so far?

997
01:40:32,334 --> 01:40:33,540
Well...

998
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:41,700
17 men, 12 women,
6 children, 3 dogs,

999
01:40:41,725 --> 01:40:47,724
One cat and two parrots
are the onces I loved.

1000
01:40:48,267 --> 01:40:50,247
What's the name of your first lover?

1001
01:40:50,834 --> 01:40:51,912
Sri Krishna

1002
01:40:52,467 --> 01:40:54,310
The last one?

1003
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:55,943
That too is Sri Krishna

1004
01:41:01,401 --> 01:41:03,133
Krishna, why are you laughing?

1005
01:41:03,134 --> 01:41:05,808
You disappointed that girl...

1006
01:41:07,134 --> 01:41:11,844
She expected from you
a woman she imagined in her mind...

1007
01:41:12,034 --> 01:41:13,877
And she expected an
answer to suit that.

1008
01:41:16,367 --> 01:41:21,146
Krishna, how can I become
what other imagine me to be?

1009
01:41:26,134 --> 01:41:30,344
Nowadays, you are not coming to me
whenever I call...

1010
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:34,081
I am tired of so many
people calling me...

1011
01:41:34,834 --> 01:41:36,677
But am I one among them?

1012
01:41:37,401 --> 01:41:40,348
My Krishnan is mine alone...

1013
01:41:48,967 --> 01:41:50,913
I am getting old, Krishna

1014
01:41:51,734 --> 01:41:52,812
Look,

1015
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,641
my hair is turning grey

1016
01:41:57,401 --> 01:41:59,711
Never thought I'd get old

1017
01:42:00,801 --> 01:42:07,741
Even the last drop of youthful blood
In my body has drained...

1018
01:42:10,134 --> 01:42:13,843
Now I will turn into a
tree that never blossoms...

1019
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:22,340
In your body, the smell of that
old Neermathalam still lingers.

1020
01:42:23,634 --> 01:42:27,582
A Neermathalam yearning to
blossom for many years

1021
01:42:27,867 --> 01:42:29,346
That is still in your mind

1022
01:42:30,767 --> 01:42:32,212
Isn't that enough?

1023
01:42:35,167 --> 01:42:37,579
Will you continue to
love me, Krishna?

1024
01:43:34,167 --> 01:43:35,245
Dasetta,

1025
01:43:37,201 --> 01:43:40,842
Is there anything to tell me, Dasettan?

1026
01:43:41,034 --> 01:43:42,809
I am happy, Aami...

1027
01:43:44,767 --> 01:43:46,041
Suffering me,

1028
01:43:47,867 --> 01:43:49,938
You lived with me all these years

1029
01:43:52,267 --> 01:43:54,338
You looked after me well...

1030
01:43:56,934 --> 01:43:59,346
You brought up my children well

1031
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:04,611
And you gave me more than I wished for...

1032
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,973
I am really happy, Aami...

1033
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,907
Why is no one leaving?

1034
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:26,873
It is midnight.

1035
01:44:28,867 --> 01:44:30,744
The body will be taken
only in the morning.

1036
01:44:31,867 --> 01:44:32,945
Monu,

1037
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:35,239
ask everyone to leave...

1038
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,812
Shodu, Chinnen, you also go to sleep.

1039
01:44:49,067 --> 01:44:51,172
Brother, go to sleep...

1040
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,173
I will stay here with Dasettan.

1041
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:04,177
Sulu, you too go...

1042
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,078
Go!

1043
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,844
Mom, please go and sleep...

1044
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:25,978
Mom, get up...

1045
01:45:26,334 --> 01:45:28,336
I will stay here

1046
01:45:29,134 --> 01:45:30,212
No.

1047
01:45:30,868 --> 01:45:31,972
You go...

1048
01:45:36,101 --> 01:45:39,548
Only this night, Dasettan
will be with me...

1049
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,383
With widowhood,
A woman's first life comes to an end...

1050
01:47:02,001 --> 01:47:06,245
Then what she gets is a second life...

1051
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,904
In the second life that counts losses

1052
01:47:13,234 --> 01:47:19,310
What is never lost
is the name one earns in first life...

1053
01:47:21,534 --> 01:47:24,947
I will always remain Mrs. Das.

1054
01:47:37,667 --> 01:47:39,578
"The Lost Neelambari"

1055
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,002
Krishna,

1056
01:47:47,634 --> 01:47:49,944
You are really weak

1057
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:53,204
I came when I heard
you're here...

1058
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,847
Anyway no one is staying here
Then why should we retain it?

1059
01:47:58,568 --> 01:48:00,411
Who will take care of it?

1060
01:48:00,901 --> 01:48:03,905
If you are selling,
there is a good buyer

1061
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,244
When I asked Mohan and Sundaran
They asked me to consult you.

1062
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:12,145
But those who buy,
won't they demolish it?

1063
01:48:12,501 --> 01:48:14,276
It is more than 150 years old...

1064
01:48:14,834 --> 01:48:16,404
And can collapse any moment.

1065
01:48:16,967 --> 01:48:19,038
Do as you wish...

1066
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:26,313
Let us keep the sacred grove and
Neermathalam tree, and sell only the rest...

1067
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:32,042
If you sell everything, memories of
Punnayulkulam too will fade away"

1068
01:48:37,834 --> 01:48:41,008
I want at least the memory of
This Neermathalam tree...

1069
01:48:58,467 --> 01:49:01,745
"The Time Neermathalam Blossomed"

1070
01:50:08,234 --> 01:50:10,771
Madam gave me an appointment today.

1071
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,372
I am Akbar Ali

1072
01:50:13,434 --> 01:50:17,143
I had sent some cassettes
of Urdu Ghazals for her...

1073
01:50:17,234 --> 01:50:18,542
Please come.

1074
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:26,678
Please be seated

1075
01:50:42,867 --> 01:50:44,505
She will be here soon.

1076
01:50:59,601 --> 01:51:01,512
I have heard a lot about you

1077
01:51:02,201 --> 01:51:03,805
Though I am meeting you
for the first time...

1078
01:51:03,867 --> 01:51:05,175
Be seated

1079
01:51:09,501 --> 01:51:12,072
For years, I've admired you...

1080
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:18,346
This meeting is Merciful Allah's blessing

1081
01:51:20,234 --> 01:51:25,934
This bewitching smile of yours
Is as soft and sweet like your words...

1082
01:51:32,634 --> 01:51:34,580
I don't know Urdu...

1083
01:51:35,534 --> 01:51:43,334
This bewitching smile of yours
Is as soft and sweet like your words...

1084
01:51:43,367 --> 01:51:44,345
Sit down.

1085
01:51:46,201 --> 01:51:49,876
If you don't mind,
Shall I sit near your feet?

1086
01:51:52,834 --> 01:51:58,477
A Muslim should not bow before anyone
Except for Allah...

1087
01:51:58,634 --> 01:52:00,341
Doesn't your Quran say so?

1088
01:52:01,367 --> 01:52:03,176
This is not bowing

1089
01:52:03,867 --> 01:52:07,246
But a self dedication as Gita says...

1090
01:52:07,867 --> 01:52:12,612
Before those we love and admire
We offer our mind and body

1091
01:52:13,867 --> 01:52:17,610
Bhagavad Gita is as great as Quran
That's what I think...

1092
01:52:18,134 --> 01:52:23,777
I've heard that you are a
great scholar and orator...

1093
01:52:24,334 --> 01:52:29,716
But you also know how
to talk sweetly

1094
01:52:30,734 --> 01:52:34,841
What you said is a
great honour for me...

1095
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:38,744
I am a humble admirer and teacher

1096
01:52:38,867 --> 01:52:39,845
That's all...

1097
01:52:40,367 --> 01:52:42,813
You are mostly in Delhi, isn't it?

1098
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,078
Yes.

1099
01:52:45,167 --> 01:52:47,704
Mini, bring some coffee...

1100
01:52:50,567 --> 01:52:55,880
For the last few days
I was listening to the ghazals you sent

1101
01:52:56,767 --> 01:53:00,738
Urdu is such a
beautiful language

1102
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:16,578
Means?

1103
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:22,716
Madhavikkutty, a gifted
writer dear to Allah

1104
01:53:22,767 --> 01:53:26,772
The gems of words that
flow from your fingers

1105
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:32,679
And the love that brims in them
I am deeply in love with them...

1106
01:53:35,767 --> 01:53:44,380

Reached home?

1117
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:22,304
No, l'm on the way

1118
01:55:26,034 --> 01:55:29,948
Like the most beautiful
ghazal I heard in my life,

1119
01:55:30,367 --> 01:55:31,903

1122
01:55:59,701 --> 01:56:02,841
I went to pick Kamala
It's her birthday today

1123
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:09,006
Kamala, this is Girija and her daughter
They stay near our house...

1124
01:56:09,501 --> 01:56:10,579
You know her, isn't it?

1125
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,674
Can widows celebrate birthdays?

1126
01:56:17,167 --> 01:56:20,366
Didn't I tell you?
Today, someone is coming to see Ammu...

1127
01:56:20,367 --> 01:56:22,347
I don't want anything
inauspicious today.

1128
01:56:26,467 --> 01:56:28,174
Why is she behaving like this?

1129
01:56:28,367 --> 01:56:30,176
Don't you know that?

1130
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:33,407
When going for something auspicious
Seeing a widow is considered inauspicious

1131
01:56:34,167 --> 01:56:36,147
She didn't like your presence...

1132
01:56:40,934 --> 01:56:42,413
Hello.
- It's Akbar Ali.

1133
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:44,438
It's Akbar Ali sir...

1134
01:56:46,434 --> 01:56:47,412
Hello...

1135
01:56:47,634 --> 01:56:50,945
My Hearty birthday wishes...

1136
01:56:52,367 --> 01:56:55,143
How do you know its my birthday?

1137
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:56,908
Did I tell you?

1138
01:56:57,034 --> 01:57:01,073
No... Shouldn't one know the
birthday of dear ones?

1139
01:57:01,534 --> 01:57:03,536
I am on the way from
Thiruvananthapuram.

1140
01:57:04,468 --> 01:57:09,144
I want to give you a birthday gift.

1141
01:57:10,234 --> 01:57:11,212
Why not?

1142
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,574
Come and have lunch here...

1143
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:23,506
I've heard you like dark colors...

1144
01:57:24,667 --> 01:57:26,146
I really liked this

1145
01:57:26,601 --> 01:57:30,276
After Dasettan's death, I
haven't celebrated birthdays

1146
01:57:30,634 --> 01:57:34,878
Maybe I felt like celebrating this year
To receive your gift.

1147
01:57:34,967 --> 01:57:36,310
Its my fortune

1148
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,276
Here are some poems I translated

1149
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,105
Poems by Iqbal and Mirza Ghalib

1150
01:57:49,234 --> 01:57:50,679
Do you know something?

1151
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:53,307
Today I was humiliated

1152
01:57:53,501 --> 01:57:55,071
for being a widow...

1153
01:57:56,901 --> 01:58:01,133
In your community,
Are widows ostracised like this?

1154
01:58:01,134 --> 01:58:02,112
NO. right?

1155
01:58:02,634 --> 01:58:05,342
If they want, they can
also remarry, isn't it?

1156
01:58:06,201 --> 01:58:09,671
Islam is a religion that
respects women highly

1157
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,575
Long ago, when I was in Calcutta
I wished to become a Muslim...

1158
01:58:18,934 --> 01:58:21,642
I also jokingly told Dasettan about it...

1159
01:58:22,067 --> 01:58:24,479
I was fascinated by the sight of
North Indian Muslim girls

1160
01:58:24,601 --> 01:58:31,644
Wearing glass bangles and
mehndi all over their hands

1161
01:58:32,534 --> 01:58:35,071
- Shall I serve lunch...?
- Yes.

1162
01:58:36,601 --> 01:58:38,342
We've only vegetarian dishes here...

1163
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:40,446
Hope you don't mind...

1164
01:58:40,501 --> 01:58:43,482
Not at all...
It's a birthday feast after all!

1165
01:58:46,468 --> 01:58:47,947
It is prayer time

1166
01:58:48,501 --> 01:58:50,139
Is there any mosque nearby?

1167
01:58:50,667 --> 01:58:53,876
I don't know...

1168
01:58:54,467 --> 01:58:57,880
Like at home, you can pray here...

1169
01:59:21,734 --> 01:59:22,712
Enough.

1170
01:59:30,634 --> 01:59:34,172
- You have two wives, isn't it?
- Yes.

1171
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:38,281
How come you married twice"
at this young age?

1172
01:59:39,434 --> 01:59:40,640
It so happened

1173
01:59:40,934 --> 01:59:43,744
Didn't your first
wife get upset?

1174
01:59:45,501 --> 01:59:50,382
If you can protect and satisfy both
And have the means and health

1175
01:59:50,601 --> 01:59:54,447
In special circumstances
It is sanctioned by Quran...

1176
01:59:55,334 --> 01:59:58,713
If necessary,
You can marry up to four, right?

1177
02:00:01,868 --> 02:00:06,180
But is it possible to apportion love?

1178
02:00:07,834 --> 02:00:11,543
I'd say love is like a wild stream

1179
02:00:12,301 --> 02:00:14,440
It can flow in any direction

1180
02:00:15,301 --> 02:00:18,407
It is our mind that
gives it direction...

1181
02:00:19,701 --> 02:00:22,944
But after sometime,
wouldn't it get weak?

1182
02:00:23,634 --> 02:00:25,545
And it slows down

1183
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:29,509
That's when people get grey and old...

1184
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:33,380
Nothing like that.

1185
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,778
There must be a sea
waiting for it, isn't it?

1186
02:00:37,434 --> 02:00:39,436
So, it has to flow...

1187
02:00:42,301 --> 02:00:45,282
Mini, serve the sweet dish...

1188
02:00:47,234 --> 02:00:50,681
After that, you've to
recite Urdu poetry

1189
02:00:50,967 --> 02:00:52,844
You can't leave before that.

1190
02:00:53,667 --> 02:00:56,978
Now I feel I am Allah's dearest.

1191
02:00:57,667 --> 02:01:02,138
That is why Allah made me
eligible for this love...

1192
02:01:04,634 --> 02:01:08,946
This youngster captivates me

1193
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:11,779
The way he speaks,

1194
02:01:12,267 --> 02:01:13,371
his scholarship,

1195
02:01:13,767 --> 02:01:14,939
his songs,

1196
02:01:15,567 --> 02:01:17,604
His innocent smile...

1197
02:01:17,701 --> 02:01:19,612
Everything attracts me to him...

1198
02:01:20,667 --> 02:01:23,773
A totally new experience

1199
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:34,312
Like a new perfect woman, untouched by age,
Taking birth inside me...

1200
02:02:54,301 --> 02:02:57,908
It has been so long since I painted!

1201
02:02:58,501 --> 02:03:03,075
When I write or paint
I don't like anyone sitting near me

1202
02:03:03,501 --> 02:03:05,447
Good that you told me...
I will leave

1203
02:03:05,801 --> 02:03:06,973
You sit there

1204
02:03:07,267 --> 02:03:11,340
I told that to Dasettan and the kids
So that I can stay alone...

1205
02:03:13,767 --> 02:03:16,213
It is not applicable for you...

1206
02:03:20,167 --> 02:03:24,775
In front of you, I am
not Kamala or Aami...

1207
02:03:25,034 --> 02:03:27,241
I've become some other woman

1208
02:03:32,334 --> 02:03:36,714
These graceful hands, capable
of writing and painting.

1209
02:03:37,267 --> 02:03:38,245
Can I touch them?

1210
02:03:56,967 --> 02:03:58,776
I am old, boy...

1211
02:04:00,434 --> 02:04:02,744
They were beautiful.

1212
02:04:03,067 --> 02:04:04,273
Now they are all wrinkled...

1213
02:04:09,034 --> 02:04:11,776
You mostly paint nudes?

1214
02:04:12,767 --> 02:04:15,270
Haven't you received a lot
of criticisms for that?

1215
02:04:16,934 --> 02:04:19,414
Those rogues have no other job...

1216
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:21,370
All are hypocrites!

1217
02:04:24,134 --> 02:04:25,943
Did you see this painting?

1218
02:04:27,101 --> 02:04:28,705
I painted it sometime back.

1219
02:04:29,367 --> 02:04:33,838
Once, a so-called painting
connoisseur from North

1220
02:04:34,267 --> 02:04:39,444
Asked me, whether it's my self portrait.

1221
02:04:40,401 --> 02:04:42,472
Does it resemble me at all?

1222
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:47,743
I removed the saree from my bosom
And asked him straight.

1223
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:51,370
Does my breast resemble hers?

1224
02:04:51,967 --> 02:04:55,039
After that, he didn't utter a word!

1225
02:04:59,234 --> 02:05:00,312
Be seated.

1226
02:05:04,401 --> 02:05:06,074
My house is by the riverside

1227
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:09,909
Lot of trees, birds, wind...

1228
02:05:10,334 --> 02:05:13,941
From my porch, one
can watch sunset

1229
02:05:15,401 --> 02:05:17,312
Will you be my guest one day?

1230
02:05:18,401 --> 02:05:20,813
You can peacefully write
and paint there...

1231
02:05:21,134 --> 02:05:23,273
I rarely go anywhere

1232
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:28,947
What if I insist?

1233
02:05:29,334 --> 02:05:31,177
Please come at least
for one or two days

1234
02:05:45,201 --> 02:05:47,078
Akbar-ka, she has arrived!

1235
02:05:54,634 --> 02:05:55,612
Please come...

1236
02:05:58,401 --> 02:05:59,778
This is my Kamarban

1237
02:06:01,334 --> 02:06:05,248
Kamar in Arab means
moon, isn't it?

1238
02:06:07,301 --> 02:06:08,279
Please come.

1239
02:06:11,101 --> 02:06:15,572
To prepare vegetarian dishes
Kamar specially brought her...

1240
02:06:15,634 --> 02:06:17,511
She knows only to
cook fish and meat.

1241
02:06:18,767 --> 02:06:23,182
I used to eat fish and chicken
When I was in Calcutta and Bombay.

1242
02:06:24,134 --> 02:06:26,171
I stopped it when Dasettan died...

1243
02:06:30,401 --> 02:06:32,779
This jack-fruit dish is delicious!

1244
02:06:34,601 --> 02:06:37,707
She is a great admirer of yours

1245
02:06:38,101 --> 02:06:42,243
She can't read or write,
but has read most of your stories

1246
02:06:43,767 --> 02:06:45,747
My grandchildren read
them out for me...

1247
02:06:47,267 --> 02:06:51,079
She has read your Neermathalam,
Childhood Memoirs etc, isn't it?

1248
02:06:51,134 --> 02:06:52,112
Yes.

1249
02:06:52,501 --> 02:06:54,003
I too am your fan

1250
02:06:54,067 --> 02:06:57,446
Not only of your writings. In your
photos, you look really beautiful

1251
02:06:57,601 --> 02:07:00,980
And in person you
look much younger!

1252
02:07:01,601 --> 02:07:05,139
You too...
As beautiful as your name

1253
02:07:09,134 --> 02:07:11,239
Today evening, I've
to go to my home...

1254
02:07:12,434 --> 02:07:13,412
Please tell her...

1255
02:07:14,467 --> 02:07:16,640
It's her sister's wedding next week

1256
02:07:17,001 --> 02:07:20,574
Purchasing ornaments and
dress is a ritual

1257
02:07:20,767 --> 02:07:22,733
She's going for that
and will return tomorrow...

1258
02:07:22,734 --> 02:07:25,647
She's feeling bad to
leave you alone...

1259
02:07:26,134 --> 02:07:27,340
It is ok...

1260
02:07:27,601 --> 02:07:29,740
Kuttiamma is here to
keep me company...

1261
02:07:30,267 --> 02:07:31,541
She'll be here...

1262
02:07:31,667 --> 02:07:33,977
I'll drop her at Kozhikode
and come back

1263
02:07:43,267 --> 02:07:45,770
You've Bharathapuzha
river at Punnayurkulam?

1264
02:07:47,734 --> 02:07:49,372
There's no river there,

1265
02:07:50,234 --> 02:07:51,645
only a pond...

1266
02:07:52,101 --> 02:07:53,375
Punnayur pond.

1267
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:03,013
It is getting late, and
master is not yet back

1268
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:05,038
You go and sleep...

1269
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:07,280
Mini, you too...

1270
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:10,080
I feel like sitting alone

1271
02:08:13,434 --> 02:08:15,505
In case you need
anything, I will stay

1272
02:08:15,734 --> 02:08:16,812
No.

1273
02:08:17,367 --> 02:08:19,074
Did I take my medicines?

1274
02:08:19,134 --> 02:08:21,774
You forgot?
I gave you during dinner...

1275
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:23,278
Yes.

1282
02:09:27,501 --> 02:09:31,506
I thought you may come
only tomorrow morning

1283
02:09:32,334 --> 02:09:34,871
To leave a guest
alone, is indecent.

1284
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:37,470
Do you usually sleep late?

1285
02:09:38,634 --> 02:09:42,582
If I sleep early,
Won't I lose this beautiful night?

1286
02:09:48,767 --> 02:09:51,338
When the river is moonlit like this

1287
02:09:52,767 --> 02:09:56,078
Have you ever swim in
it with your wife?

1288
02:09:57,434 --> 02:09:58,412
No,

1289
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:00,605
she is scared of water

1290
02:10:10,634 --> 02:10:12,341
Do you feel like swimming?

1291
02:10:15,701 --> 02:10:17,840
I have past that age

1292
02:10:18,034 --> 02:10:24,076

1304
02:12:25,068 --> 02:12:29,642
A woman living alone
Is like a placid lake

1305
02:12:30,401 --> 02:12:35,646
A small breeze is enough
To create a lot of ripples in it

1306
02:12:36,601 --> 02:12:39,309
Was Akbar a breeze like that?

1307
02:12:45,867 --> 02:12:51,010
The last night and these moments
If you think it's my impropriety

1308
02:12:53,668 --> 02:12:55,648
How do I atone for it?

1309
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:01,371
If age is not a problem

1310
02:13:02,634 --> 02:13:04,170
and nothing else stands in your way...

1311
02:13:05,901 --> 02:13:09,212
Why not spend the rest of
your life in this house?...

1312
02:13:10,367 --> 02:13:14,110
You will have to sacrifice a lot...

1313
02:13:14,767 --> 02:13:16,371
Your social status,

1314
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:19,578
Family...

1315
02:13:19,867 --> 02:13:22,746
I believe in Allah

1316
02:13:23,401 --> 02:13:27,747
If this is Allah's will
I will sacrifice anything for it...

1317
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:34,739
Won't people ridicule us?

1318
02:13:36,867 --> 02:13:42,840
The Madhavikkutty everyone knows, is
someone who does what her mind says is right

1319
02:13:49,167 --> 02:13:56,381
To remove the stigma of widowhood
I can live as a Muslim, isn't it?

1320
02:13:57,867 --> 02:14:00,939
That too, only if your mind says so...

1321
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:06,203
Will your people let
me join your religion?

1322
02:14:08,234 --> 02:14:13,240
Islam is a humanist religion
That is open to all...

1323
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,175
Won't there be oppositions?

1324
02:14:19,834 --> 02:14:22,815
Is Madhavikkutty afraid of opposition?

1325
02:14:25,867 --> 02:14:30,646
I am afraid only of myself, Akbar.

1326
02:14:35,867 --> 02:14:37,210
Did you see that?

1327
02:14:38,201 --> 02:14:40,147
Look at the morning star

1328
02:14:41,367 --> 02:14:45,213
In Arabic, it is called Surayya

1329
02:14:46,067 --> 02:14:47,045
The morning star

1330
02:14:51,701 --> 02:14:52,702
Surayya

1331
02:14:53,367 --> 02:14:54,971
if you liked that name

1332
02:14:55,634 --> 02:15:02,210
From now on, let the world
call you Kamala Surayya...

1333
02:16:04,367 --> 02:16:05,778
- Lakshmi.
- Yes.

1334
02:16:06,534 --> 02:16:10,200
Tomorrow morning, get
ready to be shocked!

1335
02:16:10,201 --> 02:16:11,475
To get shocked?

1336
02:16:11,534 --> 02:16:12,842
Not only you,

1337
02:16:13,401 --> 02:16:17,315
but everyone who knows
Kamala will be shocked...

1338
02:16:17,367 --> 02:16:19,506
At this midnight hour,
What happened to you...?

1339
02:16:19,701 --> 02:16:21,374
Better know it tomorrow

1340
02:16:23,167 --> 02:16:26,148
Kamala is going to leave
Madhavikkutty behind...

1341
02:16:27,734 --> 02:16:28,812
The rest, tomorrow...

1342
02:16:29,501 --> 02:16:33,881
Religious conversion is like changing
one's dress... That's what I feel...

1343
02:16:34,701 --> 02:16:38,274
Everyone wears the
dress they like

1344
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:40,179
That's all...

1345
02:16:43,767 --> 02:16:48,182
Instead of going to temple
Now I will go to mosque

1346
02:16:48,368 --> 02:16:49,446
and pray there

1347
02:16:50,734 --> 02:16:53,874
Only if you consider it
an international problem

1348
02:16:54,368 --> 02:16:58,316
There is earthquake and sky-collapse.

1349
02:17:01,201 --> 02:17:03,340
I've nothing more to say

1350
02:17:03,734 --> 02:17:06,840
From today on, I am not Kamaladas

1351
02:17:07,601 --> 02:17:09,410
I'm Kamala Surayya

1352
02:17:10,334 --> 02:17:13,144
This name is beautiful, isn't it?

1353
02:17:16,634 --> 02:17:19,843
Eminent writer Madhavikkutty
converts to Islam

1354
02:17:20,134 --> 02:17:26,847
She announced this while inaugurating a
conference at Library Council Hall today

1355
02:17:27,167 --> 02:17:29,733
She said she won't be Kamaladas anymore

1356
02:17:29,734 --> 02:17:33,341
She revealed that she is adopting
a new name Kamala Surayya

1357
02:17:33,501 --> 02:17:36,573
in a conference attended
by media and students

1358
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:39,237
this announcement came as a surprise...

1359
02:17:39,501 --> 02:17:40,639
What shall I do?

1360
02:17:40,701 --> 02:17:42,544
She said no visitors.

1361
02:17:42,667 --> 02:17:44,840
Tell her, we are coming
from local mosque...

1362
02:17:45,168 --> 02:17:46,511
No one is allowed inside

1363
02:17:46,667 --> 02:17:48,340
She is with her children and relatives.

1364
02:17:48,534 --> 02:17:52,710
Till now, we've never interfered
In your wishes and decisions...

1365
02:17:53,434 --> 02:17:54,742
This too is like that.

1366
02:17:55,467 --> 02:18:00,314
If you are convinced about your decision
Do as you like... but...

1367
02:18:00,734 --> 02:18:03,112
You should face the
consequences yourself

1368
02:18:04,734 --> 02:18:06,680
The relatives have
started murmuring...

1369
02:18:07,134 --> 02:18:08,545
Everyone is agitated

1370
02:18:10,701 --> 02:18:14,672
Let anyone get agitated
But I've already decided...

1371
02:18:22,567 --> 02:18:24,410
Does mother know of this?

1372
02:18:25,167 --> 02:18:27,169
She doesn't know anything these days

1373
02:18:28,134 --> 02:18:29,841
The beginning of Alzheimer's...

1374
02:18:30,234 --> 02:18:33,545
When she saw your photo in newspapers
She just gazed at it...

1375
02:18:34,367 --> 02:18:35,641
She didn't say anything

1376
02:18:37,867 --> 02:18:41,337
Monu asked me about your
relationship with Akbar

1377
02:18:42,134 --> 02:18:45,240
They said it is difficult
to discuss with you...

1378
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:26,400
That only Allah is worthy of worship
And there is no one else...

1379
02:19:26,668 --> 02:19:40,168
That Muhammed Nabi
is Allah's prophet

1380
02:19:40,334 --> 02:19:56,334
I firmly affirm it in my mind
And clearly utter with my tongue...

1381
02:20:44,667 --> 02:20:47,204
The Hindus are agitated

1382
02:20:47,767 --> 02:20:50,748
Didn't you read the
statements against you?

1383
02:20:51,567 --> 02:20:53,706
I also got many
threatening calls

1384
02:20:54,101 --> 02:20:57,981
I'd say it was a rash decision

1385
02:20:58,933 --> 02:21:03,075
My husband has asked me
to stop visiting you...

1386
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:07,080
Are people so small?

1387
02:21:07,634 --> 02:21:09,079
What kind of a world is this?

1388
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:12,610
So, you gave up your Krishna too?

1389
02:21:14,167 --> 02:21:15,908
How can I?

1390
02:21:16,067 --> 02:21:19,742
My Krishna is always with me...

1391
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:24,281
You people need not
go to Guruvayur

1392
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:27,075
Krishna is no longer there...

1393
02:21:27,567 --> 02:21:30,707
When I called, he
came away with me...

1394
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:03,514
I thought you may not
come to see me...

1395
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:07,909
Kamala, when you call
me, how can I not come?

1396
02:22:09,434 --> 02:22:11,914
Karma, only you
never forsook me...

1397
02:22:12,667 --> 02:22:13,745
That is enough for me...

1398
02:22:18,601 --> 02:22:21,309
This dress too suits you well...

1399
02:22:24,034 --> 02:22:26,571
Surayya...
Kamala Surayya...

1400
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:33,675
Which is your religion, Krishna?

1401
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:39,372
You saw me in your love for
this universe, isn't it?

1402
02:22:40,534 --> 02:22:43,344
So, isn't that my religion?

1403
02:22:45,967 --> 02:22:51,212
Then, from now on,
shall I call you Prophet?

1404
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,043
You saw me in Gita

1405
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:59,105
If you see the same me in Quran too
You can call also me so...

1406
02:23:11,367 --> 02:23:12,445
Hello...

1407
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:15,641
Who is it?
- No need to know who I am

1408
02:23:16,167 --> 02:23:18,340
You lured that woman
and converted her...

1409
02:23:20,133 --> 02:23:22,272
If you are planning
to live with her,

1410
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:26,341
You bastard, we don't give
a damn who you are!

1411
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:29,306
We'll butcher you!

1412
02:23:30,967 --> 02:23:32,307
They are threatening to kill you?

1413
02:23:33,934 --> 02:23:37,347
Why did you get into
all this trouble?

1414
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:39,580
That woman is mad

1415
02:23:39,634 --> 02:23:43,639
If you start dancing to her tunes
Me and my kid will commit suicide...

1416
02:23:44,067 --> 02:23:45,145
I warn you!

1417
02:23:52,634 --> 02:23:53,712
Hello.

1418
02:23:54,767 --> 02:23:56,644
Yes, it is me, Balachandram

1419
02:23:57,667 --> 02:23:59,146
Ok, give it to her...

1420
02:24:01,534 --> 02:24:02,612
Balan

1421
02:24:03,234 --> 02:24:06,681
Come to my flat with
Vijayalakshmi immediately.

1422
02:24:06,833 --> 02:24:09,643
Sister, I've an urgent meeting.

1423
02:24:10,267 --> 02:24:12,406
What is the matter?
- I will tell you. Come fast

1424
02:24:12,733 --> 02:24:13,811
Ok, I will...

1425
02:24:13,834 --> 02:24:17,179
Go away

1426
02:24:17,234 --> 02:24:20,366
Kamala Surayya go away.

1427
02:24:20,367 --> 02:24:23,366
Long Live Hindu Front

1428
02:24:23,367 --> 02:24:26,837
If you insult the community,

1429
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:29,676
remember you're playing with fire

1430
02:24:34,334 --> 02:24:35,412
Come.

1431
02:24:36,400 --> 02:24:37,743
Surayya, don't be scared

1432
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:41,377
Let them shout from there...

1433
02:24:41,667 --> 02:24:43,499
We are all here with you...

1434
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:46,606
Some of our boys are
here to guard you...

1435
02:24:46,734 --> 02:24:49,476
Anything you need,
they'll help you...

1436
02:24:51,467 --> 02:24:52,673
Shall we leave then?

1437
02:25:03,667 --> 02:25:05,442
What is all this, Balan?

1438
02:25:05,667 --> 02:25:07,647
Hindus say they'll kill me

1439
02:25:07,701 --> 02:25:10,181
Muslims come to guard me...

1440
02:25:10,667 --> 02:25:13,477
Go and tell them to
leave me alone.

1441
02:25:13,767 --> 02:25:18,182
You can make speeches saying one has
freedom to choose one's religion.

1442
02:25:18,801 --> 02:25:21,611
But if you practice
it, they'll interfere

1443
02:25:21,867 --> 02:25:23,175
That's the time we live in...

1444
02:25:23,567 --> 02:25:25,843
They don't have anything else to do?

1445
02:25:26,467 --> 02:25:27,844
This is what they do...

1446
02:25:28,467 --> 02:25:29,844
Now let us face it...

1447
02:25:30,801 --> 02:25:32,508
I am not scared at all

1448
02:25:33,433 --> 02:25:35,413
If they want, let them kill me...

1449
02:25:35,634 --> 02:25:37,341
Isn't it Vijayalakshmi?

1450
02:25:48,001 --> 02:25:50,538
It was strictly personal

1451
02:25:51,434 --> 02:25:53,072
Did anyone think otherwise?

1452
02:25:54,933 --> 02:25:58,881
I fear this'll turn
into a communal riot!

1453
02:26:06,734 --> 02:26:10,739
In this condition, my staying here
Will only make things worse...

1454
02:26:11,934 --> 02:26:16,007
So, l'm thinking of
going back to Delhi

1455
02:26:17,667 --> 02:26:19,840
Please forgive me...

1456
02:26:22,434 --> 02:26:23,512
So,

1457
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:27,342
you want to escape from this?

1458
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:31,545
You may go...

1459
02:26:34,767 --> 02:26:36,804
I can't curse you...

1460
02:26:38,567 --> 02:26:40,342
Because I'm a Muslim now!

1461
02:26:44,534 --> 02:26:49,506
But, whatever happens
Until death, I'll be Kamala Surayya...

1462
02:26:52,001 --> 02:26:53,179
Come on, let's go...

1463
02:27:22,867 --> 02:27:27,475
A breeze that went by, creating ripples...
That was Akbar...

1464
02:27:28,833 --> 02:27:33,373
Anyway, the lake cannot
reclaim the breeze...

1465
02:27:50,034 --> 02:27:51,112
Mom...

1466
02:28:17,167 --> 02:28:19,238
In a way, it is good

1467
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:22,177
that Mom is not aware of anything

1468
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:28,346
Or, is she pretending?

1469
02:28:30,067 --> 02:28:33,947
Pretending she doesn't
know anything!

1470
02:28:34,467 --> 02:28:37,710
♪ 'The night is about to go to sleep' ♪

1471
02:28:37,800 --> 02:28:51,800

1475
02:29:09,133 --> 02:29:10,771
- Where is she?
- Inside.

1476
02:29:15,201 --> 02:29:16,279
Mam...

1477
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,776
Why did you return
Without staying back for the funeral?

1478
02:29:22,034 --> 02:29:24,378
The media people were
looking for you...

1479
02:29:26,501 --> 02:29:30,608
I left because I didn't
want them to pick on me...

1480
02:29:32,967 --> 02:29:36,642
Mom had written a lot
about motherhood...

1481
02:29:37,233 --> 02:29:44,276
But when I was a child, I don't
remember her hugging or cuddling me...

1482
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:49,674
If you have love within,
why not show it?

1483
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:54,310
How can one not fondle
one's children?

1484
02:29:55,901 --> 02:29:59,405
I brought up my kids,
Fondling them a lot...

1485
02:30:02,334 --> 02:30:03,642
Do you know something?

1486
02:30:04,034 --> 02:30:09,040
None of my Hindu
friends visit me now...

1487
02:30:11,967 --> 02:30:17,610
Yesterday, people there were staring at me
As if I were a strange animal!

1488
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:24,313
How can they behave like this?

1489
02:30:25,334 --> 02:30:26,677
Sad!

1490
02:30:27,534 --> 02:30:30,140
Yes, I think it is this house!

1491
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:31,640
Get down...

1492
02:30:39,567 --> 02:30:41,638
- Who are you?
- I want to meet Kamalutty.

1493
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:43,441
- Who?
- Kamala Surayya.

1494
02:30:43,667 --> 02:30:46,375
I can't let you in like that.
You've to take prior appointment.

1495
02:30:47,334 --> 02:30:48,642
Please tell her, she knows me...

1496
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:52,372
Ask them

1497
02:30:53,167 --> 02:30:55,306
Where are you from?
- From Kozhikode...

1498
02:30:55,867 --> 02:30:58,143
I was with her long time back

1499
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:03,671
She wrote these books about me...

1500
02:31:08,567 --> 02:31:09,645
Ok, go ahead

1501
02:31:10,734 --> 02:31:12,699
You may go...
I'll come later.

1502
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:13,678
Okay.

1503
02:31:13,734 --> 02:31:15,270
You too go with her...

1504
02:31:15,501 --> 02:31:16,579
Go to the bus stand.

1505
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:17,806
Who are you all?

1506
02:31:20,567 --> 02:31:24,845
I can't think and write
as per your decisions...

1507
02:31:25,334 --> 02:31:27,211
It's my freedom...

1508
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:31,375
You may be a writer or whatever
But you are a Muslim now...

1509
02:31:32,167 --> 02:31:37,640
Islam clearly lays down rules about
How Muslim women should behave.

1510
02:31:37,701 --> 02:31:39,333
As per your directions

1511
02:31:39,334 --> 02:31:44,306
Don't I make speeches about such things
To women in Kozhikode and Malappuram?

1512
02:31:44,534 --> 02:31:45,612
Isn't that enough?

1513
02:31:45,700 --> 02:31:47,270
That's not the issue here...

1514
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:53,844
If Surayya writes and does things
like Madhavikkutty did earlier,

1515
02:31:54,234 --> 02:31:56,145
We'll have to interfere in that.

1516
02:32:01,101 --> 02:32:02,671
You all had tea?

1517
02:32:03,267 --> 02:32:04,345
Now you may leave.

1518
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:06,202
I've some work to do...

1519
02:32:23,701 --> 02:32:25,339
Hey, wait.

1520
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:27,609
Can I take a photo?

1521
02:32:34,867 --> 02:32:36,813
- We're leaving.
- Okay. Go!

1522
02:32:44,234 --> 02:32:45,838
Recognize me?

1523
02:32:55,833 --> 02:32:57,642
You, Januam ma!

1524
02:32:59,367 --> 02:33:02,644
Who are these people?
I saw many of them downstairs too...

1525
02:33:04,567 --> 02:33:07,548
I couldn't recognize you at first!

1526
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:10,077
What kind of a dress is this?

1527
02:33:10,567 --> 02:33:12,444
So, you didn't know anything?!

1528
02:33:12,834 --> 02:33:14,177
The boys told me

1529
02:33:14,467 --> 02:33:16,140
I saw your photo in
the papers too...

1530
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:18,346
But I never imagined it like this!

1531
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:23,206
You came alone from Kozhikode?

1532
02:33:23,534 --> 02:33:25,878
My son-in-law dropped me here...

1533
02:33:26,367 --> 02:33:28,745
They all don't like you now...

1534
02:33:29,367 --> 02:33:31,210
Because you changed religion

1535
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:37,613
Before I die,
I wanted to see my Kamala once more...

1536
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:49,339
This was unnecessary, Kamala.

1537
02:33:49,867 --> 02:33:54,873
Now, like before, can you put big bindi
on your face, and let your hair down?

1538
02:33:55,534 --> 02:33:58,515
That image is imprinted
in everyone's mind!

1539
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:00,508
You shouldn't have done this!

1540
02:35:13,667 --> 02:35:14,745
Mini,

1541
02:35:15,601 --> 02:35:17,842
what do you like me to look as?

1542
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:21,506
As Kamala or Surayya?

1543
02:35:43,967 --> 02:35:45,537
- Sukumaretta
- Yes.

1544
02:35:45,834 --> 02:35:47,012
Did you hear?

1545
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:49,499
Kamala Surayya is coming
to Punnayurkulam tomorrow!

1546
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:51,537
- Its there in the papers!
- I saw!

1547
02:35:51,834 --> 02:35:53,074
Coming there is fine!

1548
02:35:53,167 --> 02:35:55,977
But if she enters the serpent grove,
We won't allow it!

1549
02:35:56,967 --> 02:36:00,574
Now it is the temple com mittee
That lights the lamp there!

1550
02:36:00,934 --> 02:36:02,641
- Don't you know that?
- I know...

1551
02:36:02,767 --> 02:36:04,766
This portion of the compound

1552
02:36:04,767 --> 02:36:07,941
And the house I only bought those!

1553
02:36:08,601 --> 02:36:12,549
This serpent grove and the land where
Neermathalam stands still belongs to her!

1554
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:15,581
How can I tell them
not to enter there?

1555
02:36:15,634 --> 02:36:17,910
They are going to donate this land
To Literature Academy!

1556
02:36:17,967 --> 02:36:18,967
I know that too...

1557
02:36:18,967 --> 02:36:21,208
If anyone comes to
demolish the grove

1558
02:36:22,067 --> 02:36:23,145
We won't allow that!

1559
02:36:34,267 --> 02:36:39,546
Maybe this is my last
visit to Punnayurkulam

1560
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:44,146
And to the land of Neermathalam!

1561
02:36:45,800 --> 02:36:49,247
Kamala Surayya, go back!

1562
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:54,841
Don't play with faith.
It's dangerous.

1563
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:58,233
Sir, please ask them to move aside

1564
02:36:58,234 --> 02:37:01,681
Kamala Surayya, go back!

1565
02:37:03,733 --> 02:37:10,014
Don't play with faith.
It is dangerous!

1566
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:15,713
Move aside, man
Let her get down...

1567
02:37:17,800 --> 02:37:20,804
Madam, the people are a bit violent!
Isn't it better to go back?

1568
02:37:21,567 --> 02:37:24,013
No, I wont go back

1569
02:37:24,734 --> 02:37:26,008
If they want, let them kill me...

1570
02:37:26,100 --> 02:37:27,977
Take that wheel chair

1571
02:37:30,101 --> 02:37:32,775
Where are you going?
Move!

1572
02:37:32,834 --> 02:37:35,815
Move away!

1573
02:37:51,067 --> 02:37:56,067
We won't allow desecration
of serpent grove.

1574
02:37:59,067 --> 02:38:02,766
Don't play with faith.
It is dangerous.

1575
02:38:02,767 --> 02:38:06,874
We won't allow desecration
of serpent grove.

1576
02:38:08,901 --> 02:38:11,882
Kamala Surayya, go back!

1577
02:38:11,934 --> 02:38:14,608
No entry to the grove

1578
02:38:14,667 --> 02:38:16,933
Kamala Surayya, go back!

1579
02:38:16,934 --> 02:38:18,936
You better go back!

1580
02:38:19,201 --> 02:38:21,300
Otherwise blood will
be spilled here!

1581
02:38:21,301 --> 02:38:23,076
Non-Hindus are not allowed
desecrate this place

1582
02:38:23,134 --> 02:38:25,239
- Don't play with the goddess!
- Push that hag aside!

1583
02:38:29,167 --> 02:38:34,742
My mother, grandma and great grandma
Had lighted lamp in this grove!

1584
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:37,671
Their souls are hovering here

1585
02:38:38,667 --> 02:38:44,174
In whatever manner, name or dress I come

1586
02:38:44,767 --> 02:38:47,111
They won't say no to me!

1587
02:38:49,367 --> 02:38:51,574
I won't come back here again!

1588
02:38:52,534 --> 02:38:56,414
But before I leave this soil,

1589
02:38:57,367 --> 02:39:04,080
It is my right to come to this serpent
grove and the Neermathalam tree...

1590
02:39:05,100 --> 02:39:07,080
Don't anyone dare to prevent me!

1591
02:39:22,667 --> 02:39:24,408
I am Valli, mistress!

1592
02:39:24,534 --> 02:39:26,343
Do you remember me?

1593
02:39:28,667 --> 02:39:31,341
But Valli calls herself servant,

1594
02:39:31,467 --> 02:39:34,141
Isn't it so, Valli?

1595
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:50,076
Please let me sit here
alone for some time...

1596
02:39:50,467 --> 02:39:53,311
All of you, please disperse...

1597
02:39:54,234 --> 02:39:55,611
Come on, leave.

1598
02:40:51,167 --> 02:40:57,743
I won't be able to come here again, Kanna.

1599
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:06,245
I am also leaving my Krishna here...

1600
02:41:10,301 --> 02:41:15,410
I think it is time for
me to leave everything

1601
02:41:17,100 --> 02:41:22,015
If that is your destiny,
How can I prevent it?

1602
02:42:14,467 --> 02:42:20,611
When it is time to die,
The wild elephants can sense it...

1603
02:42:24,001 --> 02:42:25,079
Then,

1604
02:42:25,500 --> 02:42:31,348
they move away from other elephants
And withdraw into inner forest

1605
02:42:33,067 --> 02:42:40,918
In the solitude and security of the forest
They seek a lonely death!

1606
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:48,440
Like that,
I too am a wild elephant now

1607
02:42:52,367 --> 02:42:57,578
A wild elephant, withdrawn into
the forest. lying tired...

1608
02:43:00,034 --> 02:43:06,349
Around me,
only the silent music of the forest.
