1
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,192
"Let's go get it.."

2
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:08,494
"Let's go get it...
says every nerve in my body.."

3
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,926
Can't you bathe quietly?

4
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,095
Does your blood boil after
you take off your clothes?

5
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,604
Let me sleep.

6
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,467
"Go for it. Go for it...India!"

7
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,075
Hello...will you drink some tea?

8
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,509
I made extra.

9
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,015
I'll keep it in the fridge.
You can drink it if you like.

10
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,056
Stop skinning the bread.

11
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,693
Don't wake up, don't eat...

12
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,766
Because this is the time
for your beauty sleep.

13
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,697
Its only 8 o'clock now.

14
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,606
Why can't you sleep
at night like humans?

15
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,543
I can do whatever I like.

16
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,671
You didn't have to
come to Delhi for all this.

17
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,745
Didn't you have internet
connection at Kanpur?

18
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,047
Look...you're my roommate,
not my father.

19
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,821
And I know what I do.

20
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,591
How long are you going.

21
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,251
...to live-off on all
your girlfriends' money.

22
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:50,401
Money in life & Runs in twenty twenty
should keep coming. How they come

23
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,164
No one bothers

24
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,796
What comes fast,
goes even faster.

25
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,603
Easy come, easy go.

26
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,568
Bye-bye.

27
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,079
What's the problem?
What is the matter?

28
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,776
Agyatshatru knows everything.

29
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,980
What's this? White shirt?

30
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,491
White isn't lucky for
you according to your stars.

31
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,556
What difference does it make?

32
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,095
It'll turn black by the
time I get to the office.

33
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,195
Yes, I hope it does.

34
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,581
Hello, birthday girl.
- Morning.

35
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,551
Are you deaf? Drive properly.

36
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,522
You're in a damn hurry?
- Excuse me?

37
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,823
No, Megha, not you.

38
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,258
That driver. .

39
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,657
Anyway, what were you saying?

40
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,822
Office?
I'm on my way there now.

41
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,830
Why do you sound so tense?
- Yes, Megha.

42
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,762
A lot depends on today's presentation.

43
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,863
I hope everything goes well.

44
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,271
Don't worry.

45
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,706
Oh no, police.
- Stop.

46
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,765
Oh no, Prithvi..

47
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,742
Stop the car on the side.
- Sorry, sir.

48
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,247
Forget this scrap, and chase him.

49
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,345
What happened?
- I am safe.

50
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,853
Megha, the police is
on high alert these days.

51
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,149
I'll call you later, okay.

52
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,517
Yeah, okay.

53
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,421
And yeah.
- Yes.

54
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,189
Don't forget.
Mosaic, 7:30. And don't be late.

55
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,820
Me? Late?

56
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,494
Bye.
- Yeah...bye.

57
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,099
Ladies and Gentlemen.

58
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,865
Finally, this is the
layout of the inner-wing.

59
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,633
It will have an inner courtyard...

60
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,107
...which represents all
the states of the country.

61
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,642
Impressive I must say.

62
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,712
Thank you, thank you.

63
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,681
What about the parking
extension that we specified?

64
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,617
But sir, we would encroach
on public property.

65
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,087
And, we could get
into legal hassles later.

66
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:56,557
Ms. Wahi, if we leave valuable properly
like this We'll lose millions.

67
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,152
But, sir...
- Don't worry, Mr. Shah.

68
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,356
We'll make the modifications
according to your specifications.

69
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,195
Don't worry, madam.

70
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,204
We'll get this done within a week.

71
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,703
Sir, what We're doing
is completely illegal.

72
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,867
Prithvi, you know the
condition of the market.

73
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,807
But try to...
- We have to compromise...

74
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,402
...to get anything big done in life.

75
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,108
And you know how important
this project is for us.

76
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,172
Sir...

77
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,646
Okay...now don't think too much.

78
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,154
Just modify the design, okay.

79
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,060
Hello. - I am going
to Mumbai for 2 days.

80
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,687
You always disappear when
it's time to pay the rent.

81
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,724
You can go after paying your share.

82
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,029
I am not going to pay a penny-

83
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,200
Mr. Patel can throw
you out if he likes.

84
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:45,068
Don't worry about me.
I am going to arrange for money.

85
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,077
'Arrange for money!'

86
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,304
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

87
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,642
My name is Mr. Prithvi Khurana.

88
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,777
I have a reservation for two.

89
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,011
Excuse me,
I've ordered for a head-shape cake...

90
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,448
...with 25 candles.
- I will double-check it, sir.

91
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,540
Thank you.

92
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:35,289
But why, Anuj? I submitted
all the requirements a week ago...

93
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,418
...so, why didn't
we get permissions yet?

94
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,919
No way.
- Hi...

95
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,196
No illegal or
under-table permissions.

96
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,258
...will be allowed on my show.

97
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,663
Do you understand?
Good.

98
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,400
Now call me when you've
got the permissions, and hurry up.

99
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,135
I an": so sorry I an": late.

100
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,267
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

101
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,335
This is so pretty.

102
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,510
Oh yes, how was your presentation?

103
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,083
Presentation...
- Excuse me, sir.

104
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,551
Your cake with 26 candles.
- 26'?

105
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,254
Hold on.

106
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,582
I specifically said...
25 candles. 25.

107
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,089
One for good luck,
it's complimentary, sir.

108
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,161
Okay...now come on, make a wish.

109
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,693
So?

110
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,965
So what?

111
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,668
What did you wish for?

112
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,463
Never mind.

113
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:25,738
What?

114
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,669
Prithvi, I am not getting any younger.

115
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,038
So, the extra candle
was for good luck.

116
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,651
Okay, fine.

117
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,516
Before you start shedding
your priceless tears..

118
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,154
...l have a small request.

119
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,279
What now?

120
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,689
Megha, will you marry me?

121
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,130
"Only a lover..."

122
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,240
"..knows how the head feels."

123
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,272
"It's an ambiance of happiness."

124
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,382
"I wonder why it's afraid of joy."

125
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,290
"Only a lover..."

126
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,922
"..knows what the heart thinks."

127
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,331
"It's an ambiance of happiness."

128
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:31,306
"I wonder why it's afraid of joy."

129
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:39,010
"Sweetheart head's
only for you, but."

130
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:47,553
"It's an unknown journey."

131
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:56,790
"No bungalows,
or expensive cars...only dreams."

132
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:02,063
"All I have...is my heart."

133
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,242
"Will you still come with me?"

134
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,874
"Will you.."

135
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,769
How much?

136
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,607
100. - Okay, sir.

137
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,739
Did you reset
the meter to zero?

138
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,241
Yes, sir.
How much can I swindle in 100?

139
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,755
No cards
for transactions under 500.

140
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,319
Thank you, sir.
Have a good day.

141
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,962
10 rupees.

142
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,007
I haven't eaten anything for 2 days.

143
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,338
10 rupees?

144
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,606
Spare me something if you can.

145
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,597
Sorry.

146
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:12,394
1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...

147
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,259
9...10!

148
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,698
100 cores!

149
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,711
Good morning, sir. This is Vaishali,
how may I assist you?

150
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,891
Is there a problem
with your ATM at GK?

151
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,193
Just give me a moment, sir.

152
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,460
If you need money, come to us.

153
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,568
Thanks for being with us, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the machine.

154
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,728
Of course there is?

155
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,636
It's showing absurd
balance in my account.

156
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,537
Sir, can I have your
account number please?

157
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,338
Yes...

158
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,970
0053.
- 0053

159
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,805
192... Sorry,

160
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:09,009
00532391 .
- 2391 .

161
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,520
6449.
- 6449...

162
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,183
6582.
- 6582...

163
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,920
This account is in the name
of Mr. Prithvi Khurana.

164
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,962
That's me.

165
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,922
Could you please tell
me my balance, please?

166
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,100
I'm sorry sir,
but this is a Platinum account.

167
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,331
And we cannot provide you
with any detail over the phone.

168
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,336
Platinum account? Since when?

169
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,377
Is there anything else
I can help you with, sir?

170
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,543
No, it's okay. Thank you.

171
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,981
Thank you for calling, sir.
Have a very nice day.

172
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,250
Platinum account?

173
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:02,422
Yeah...I'll get it done.

174
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,261
I am on my way to the ATM.
To withdraw cash.

175
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,201
Don't worry.
You will get it.

176
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,398
Yes, yes.

177
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,501
So what's new?

178
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,611
Hey... What's going on there?

179
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,705
Hey...

180
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,751
What are you doing?
- You can keep it if this is yours?

181
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,584
Put this away...
Why did you touch my car?

182
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,889
Oh...sorry, mister.

183
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,089
My car was parked
in the same place, so..

184
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,234
Can't you tell the difference
between Skoda and Maruti?

185
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,969
Sorry, sorry..
- Stupid oaf!

186
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,562
I'll set you straight.

187
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,504
Someone was trying
to jack my car.

188
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,327
Hi. - Where are you?

189
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,663
Studio. Where are you?

190
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,434
Can we meet?
- Is everything okay, Prithvi?

191
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,602
Saket...! Immediately.

192
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,475
It's very important, Megha.

193
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,105
What's Wrong?
Tell me something at least.

194
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,411
I can't tell you
over the phone, Megha.

195
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,414
It's something serious.

196
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,682
10 minutes...
I'll be there okay.

197
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,017
<i>Okay.-</i>

198
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,968
Any order for you?

199
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,566
Can I get some water?
- Of course, sir.

200
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,802
But any order for you?

201
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,669
A cup of tea.
- Sure, sir.

202
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,946
Where are you, Megha?

203
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,914
Did you go to the ATM?

204
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,623
Who's this?

205
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,423
You did, didn't you?

206
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,360
Who are you?

207
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,859
Dawood.

208
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,559
Dawood, Who?

209
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,658
How many Dawoods
do you know?

210
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,434
What?

211
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,770
I transferred that
money in your account.

212
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,772
When, who, how much and
where it needs to be delivered..

213
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,545
...l will tell you.

214
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,311
But.
- Don't interrupt.

215
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,319
You'll get 200,000 on every delivery,
as commission.

216
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,889
And the 25,000 that
you just withdrew“.

217
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,954
...consider that as an advance,
on your first commission.

218
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:49,931
But. - If you mess up,
then you and your Megha.

219
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,060
What happened?
- Nothing. Let's go.

220
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,770
Let's go.

221
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,604
What's wrong, Prithvi.
- Don't look anywhere. Just come.

222
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,477
Where are we going?

223
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,176
What's wrong, Prithvi?

224
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,021
Nothing.
- Nothing?

225
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,352
Why did you say "I can't
tell you over the phone"..

226
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,723
..."It's a serious matter".

227
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,922
You're hiding something.
- Hiding?

228
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,758
What can I be hiding?
Nothing.

229
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,661
And why are you looking
back repeatedly?

230
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:29,170
Prithvi, are you having second thoughts?
- What?

231
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,473
Megha, I love you.

232
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,700
I don't want to lose you.

233
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,212
Why are you saying that?

234
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,648
You're so stupid.

235
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,716
After this, I won't leave you..

236
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,913
...even if you want to get rid of me.

237
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,554
Let's go to my home.

238
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,156
I'll make you some nice tea,
you can relax.

239
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,423
Megha, I'll drop you at the office.

240
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,988
I need some time to think.

241
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,134
But I'll call you
once I'm feeling better.

242
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,029
Promise?

243
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,004
Promise.

244
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,815
Who is it?
- It's me, Lacchmi.

245
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,877
What is it?

246
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,821
You were supposed to pay me today.

247
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,081
This is not the appropriate time.

248
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,287
Come back in the morning.
- Fine.

249
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,658
I'll come back in the morning.

250
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,130
If you don't pay up tomorrow,
you can find yourself a new maid.

251
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,967
Laxmi, hold on.

252
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,372
Thank you, sir.
But I don't have change.

253
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,709
No change?
Go get it from the shop below.

254
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,314
It's just 200 rupees, sir.
You can adjust it next month.

255
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,628
It's 250...

256
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,022
Yeah, fine.

257
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,945
'Then you and your Megha..'

258
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,380
'But White isn't lucky
according to your stars today.'

259
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,651
'If you need money,
come to us.'

260
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,636
Please...

261
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,004
Please, spare me.

262
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,542
Please, spare me.

263
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,168
I'll do as you say.

264
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,680
I am just an ordinary,
coward man.

265
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,719
Stupid, you let go.

266
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,716
Let go of my leg.

267
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,388
Were you dreaming?

268
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,656
Nightmares.

269
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,210
Do you know what
happened today, Sam?

270
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,356
I don't know what's all this about.

271
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,059
I went to the ATM.

272
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:15,026
Do you know what my balance was?

273
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,564
It was...

274
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:21,730
Sam.

275
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,933
Sam.

276
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,772
Megha?

277
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,455
There are programs on television.

278
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,990
...like astrology, numerology, Vaastu.

279
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,159
Do you think they are genuine?

280
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:52,929
Excuse me, Goodwill Apartment?
- What number?

281
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,561
301.
- Yes, that's mine.

282
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,140
What do you want?
- Yours.

283
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,370
Don't be fooled by his looks.
That's his apartment.

284
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:05,776
Well, there's a Mr, Prithvi Khurana
who lives there.

285
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,341
But that doesn't make
it Prithvi Khurana's flat.

286
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,682
I am the Landlord.

287
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,552
I am sorry... I see!

288
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,022
I've seen Prithvi's horoscope.

289
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,425
You can let me see
your daughter's as well.

290
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,826
Daughter? Horoscope?

291
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:25,631
Offer black mustard on Saturdays,
along with oil.

292
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,162
You're going through a bad phase,
it's clearly visible.

293
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,398
Yes, fine.
Thank you very much.

294
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,636
Thank you.

295
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,794
Who is it?
- Mr. Khurana.

296
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,296
Yes,
- We're from the bank.

297
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,864
Bank? What do you want?

298
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,236
Sir, we want to welcome you..

299
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,970
...to our exclusive Platinum Club.

300
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,045
Just give me a moment.

301
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,346
If you want, we can come back later.
- No, no, it's not.

302
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,515
Sam!
Sam!

303
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,590
Get up.

304
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,554
I'll just be with you.
- Absolutely, sir.

305
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,618
Take your time please.

306
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,356
Sorry... Yeah-yeah.

307
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,895
I'll be there,
just give me a minute please.

308
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,763
Sorry.

309
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,101
Its okay, its okay.

310
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,740
I am Tharwani.

311
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,746
DK Tharwani, Vice President.
Times Bank.

312
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,948
Please...come in.

313
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:49,949
Thank you.

314
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,384
Hello, sir.

315
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,353
Yes?

316
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,454
Sir.

317
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,231
Mr. Khurana, thank you very much..

318
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,827
...for choosing our bank
for such a big transaction.

319
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,838
We are really honored.

320
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:18,138
By the way,
your lifestyle's quite simple.

321
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,352
Mr. Khurana, this visiting
card has my personal mobile number.

322
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,455
Anytime, you need any amount.

323
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,789
...l am just a phone
call away from here.

324
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,221
Once again, thank you very much.

325
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,922
For choosing our bank.

326
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,160
And I hope you'll continue
doing so in the future too.

327
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,368
Thank you very much, Mr. Tharwani.

328
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,967
Thank you very much,
it's a pleasure meeting you, sir.

329
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,533
And you too, ma'am.
Thank you.

330
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,078
Have a nice day, sir.

331
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,304
Bye.
- Okay, bye.

332
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,643
Thank you. Bye.

333
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,444
See you, bye.

334
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,616
So...who was she?

335
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,617
Is Megha's out of the picture?

336
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,786
She Wasn't bad.

337
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,929
Sam.
- What's for lunch?

338
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,530
Bloody cheapskate.

339
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,706
You could've at least
taken me to a decent place.

340
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,536
You're a millionaire now,
yet this is what you treat me to..

341
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:23,010
Speak softly. That's not my money.
- I see.

342
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,340
Tell me something.

343
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,379
Did you know Dawood
from the beginning?

344
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,848
Are you crazy?

345
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,045
Then...how could he choose you?

346
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,088
Why you?

347
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:38,526
You've no kin or kith.
- Maybe that's why.

348
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,986
Let's tell the police.

349
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,523
Think about it.
We'll get fame...and forune.

350
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,693
Your photo will be on
every newspaper and channel.

351
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:52,531
Soon you'll be Great Prithvi Khurana.

352
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,906
I am not sure about Great.

353
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,504
But, I'll definitely
be Late Prithvi Khurana.

354
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,679
They know everything, Sam.

355
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,342
Megha too.

356
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,076
They won't spare us alive.

357
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,581
This is a fine mess I got into.

358
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:06,621
So what?

359
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,418
You'll be a millionaire as well.

360
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,651
You always thought,
a few extra thousands in life..

361
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,190
...would help you settle down.

362
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,833
Just think,
200,000 for every delivery.

363
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,232
You'll be rich.

364
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,497
But it won't be my
hard-earned money.

365
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,266
Don't be foolish.

366
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,275
It's a hard job
to manage 100 cores.

367
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,704
And then,
you don't have a choice.

368
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,377
Carry on with a smile.
- What?

369
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,612
Imagine that you're hurt
- Yes.

370
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,211
And you've to apply antiseptic
over it. Now, you've two choices.

371
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,721
Either you do it with a smile,
or scream.

372
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,021
We're decent people, Sam.

373
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,193
Think about it...its illegal money.

374
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,927
To hell with Decency.

375
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,524
What else can you do?

376
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,595
Prithvi, you know
they're dangerous people.

377
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,263
What happened?
- Turn around, - What?

378
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,673
That man's following us.
See.

379
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,176
Don't look..
- Yes, he's coming after us.

380
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,140
I said speak softly.

381
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,010
Now do one thing... Run!

382
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:06,809
Run!

383
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,112
Run, Sam. Save yourself.

384
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,811
What the...

385
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:31,765
Who was he?
- He was the vendor.

386
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,475
We forgot to pay him.

387
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,010
You're too scared.

388
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,846
Come on, let's go.

389
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,647
Come on.

390
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,858
What are you thinking?

391
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,485
Nothing...

392
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:55,963
About Megha.

393
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,125
Did you tell her?

394
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:00,895
It will scare her.

395
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,437
Here... She has along life.

396
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,478
Private Number calling.

397
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,242
She won't die so easily.

398
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,247
Hello. - Thank God
you answered my call.

399
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,682
Megha, you?

400
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,846
Long life.
I was just thinking about you.

401
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,117
Why weren't you answering
my call last night?

402
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,488
Megha, I didn't realize
when I fell asleep.

403
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,126
Are you sure you're okay?

404
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:31,224
Did you eat?
- Yeah. I just had fritters with Sam.

405
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,233
Fritters in the morning?

406
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,767
Don't you have office today?
- No.

407
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:41,935
Megha, I thought about
taking a break today.

408
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,603
That's good.

409
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,978
You've been quite
tense the last few days.

410
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,573
By the way, come with me
to Shipra Mall in the evening.

411
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,017
There's a big sale
on wedding accessories.

412
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,156
But...shopping for wedding now?

413
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,452
It's the End of Season sale.

414
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:59,289
And...l am ordering you, not asking you.

415
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,365
You're coming with me.
- Okay.

416
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,330
What time?
- Pick me up at 6.

417
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,533
And now stop sulking.

418
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,931
Bye.
- Love you, bye.

419
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,377
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

420
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,414
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

421
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,344
Why did I tell this fool?

422
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:25,979
One, ten,
thousand, ten thousand...Lakh..

423
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,249
Sam!

424
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,219
Isn't that right?

425
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,485
How many, 8 or 9?

426
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,601
Yes, Megha.

427
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:51,144
Dawood!

428
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:54,474
Yes?

429
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,013
6 o'clock, at the border.

430
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,885
Under the bridge.

431
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,981
...there will be a black
Scorpio parked near the river.

432
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,491
Note down the number.

433
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,160
Sir, you're mistaken.

434
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,128
You can take your money back.

435
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,792
I won't tell anyone anything, promise.

436
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,436
Hello. Hello.

437
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,266
Who is this?

438
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,531
Hello!

439
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:26,245
<i>Note down the number...
MH.4S.3268.</i>

440
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,145
Deliver 10 crore.

441
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,410
What the.

442
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,521
What a voice?

443
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,182
Such bass.

444
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,285
Now call Advani.
- Tharwani.

445
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,728
Whatever.

446
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:42,797
It's pointless.

447
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,594
If we have to get to the border by 6...

448
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,999
...we'll have to withdraw
the money on the way.

449
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,593
Hurry up then.

450
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,097
Be on time.

451
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,300
First impression
is the lasting one.

452
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,304
And I'll go with you.

453
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,938
It's en-route to my call-center.
I know that area really well.

454
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,910
And...it's not safe for you to go alone.

455
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:05,653
Megha won't spare me.
- Make some excuse to her.

456
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,352
Why do you think so much?

457
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,480
You work for Dawood now.

458
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,491
Don't be such a wimp.

459
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,428
Yes, baby.
- Megha.

460
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,993
Prithvi,
No excuses now.

461
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,264
Megha, I am sorry.

462
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,467
I've just been called
to the office urgently.

463
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,267
But you took an off today, didn't you?

464
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,903
Yes, Megha, but you know my boss.

465
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,709
He thinks he owns me.

466
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,942
He thinks he owns me.
- Oh, Prithvi, come on.

467
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,848
You know I hate going alone.

468
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,283
Look, Megha, I'll call you
as soon as I've some free time.

469
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,853
Please, bye.

470
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,484
Come on.
What did she say?

471
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,184
What will she say?

472
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,925
Let's go then.

473
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,960
Tell me something...

474
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,730
Dawood transferred that money...

475
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,461
What's Wrong?

476
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,936
Shut up.
Do you have to take names?

477
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,631
Sorry.

478
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,275
He transferred the money
to your account, right?

479
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,771
So?

480
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,405
Your account's platinum.

481
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,477
Will you be more specific?

482
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,111
Look, probably even he doesn't know...

483
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,485
...where his money's lying,
and in which accounts.

484
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,054
I was saying...we'll go to Malkani...
- Tharwani!

485
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,130
Tharwani!
- Yes.

486
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,932
We'll go to Tharwani!
Ask him for 15, and deliver 10.

487
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,398
And the rest.

488
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,260
What are you doing?

489
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,771
Take a rickshaw and leave.
I'll manage alone.

490
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,173
Listen to me.

491
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,243
You always said,
if you had some spare money..

492
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,413
...you would invest
it in property. Right'?

493
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:42,317
I was just saying...
we'll buy a hot property.

494
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,645
Sell it in a month or two,
for a profitable price..

495
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,844
...and give that money back.

496
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,212
Simple.

497
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,049
It was just a suggestion.

498
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:03,603
Yes, please.

499
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,863
We're hereto see Mr. Irani...

500
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,870
We're hereto meet Mr. Tharwani.
- Yes.

501
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,141
Do you have an appointment?

502
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,808
Tell him...
Mr. Prithvi Khurana's here, personally.

503
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,556
Don't be a wimp.
- Okay.

504
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,225
I am trying-

505
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,058
Sh', you?

506
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,762
What a surprise. Please come in.

507
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,768
Please.
- Thank you.

508
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,235
Come in.

509
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,111
Sit.
Please sit.

510
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,643
Sit down!

511
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,078
You can go.

512
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,915
Order, sir.

513
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:58,590
Mr. Tharwani, we needed some money.

514
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,063
Sir, why did you take the trouble?

515
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,223
You could've called me,
I would've delivered it personally.

516
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:07,428
No, sir,
we were close-by, so I thought.

517
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,571
Sir, you're always
welcome Mr. Khurana.

518
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,732
Sorry, what would you like to have?

519
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,743
Tea or coffee?
- Don't you have something cold?

520
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,141
Excuse him.

521
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,943
No, We're in a bit of a hurry.

522
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:23,143
So if you could hurry up..
- No problem, sir.

523
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,311
How much?
- Around..

524
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,513
15! Crores...

525
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,217
Fifteen!
- Just a minute.

526
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,431
Bring 15 cores in my cabin, cash.

527
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,164
<i>Okay.-</i>

528
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,236
Fine...
Bring what we have.

529
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,809
Sorry, sir. We cannot arrange for 15.

530
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:55,008
But I've instructed
them to get what we have.

531
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,153
So...we can arrange for 10.
- No problem..

532
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,346
That's strange.

533
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,913
He's got vast sums of
money in numerous accounts.

534
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,060
But he never faced any
problem in those places.

535
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,809
Boss said 10...

536
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,991
Stay in your limit.

537
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,816
...and you'll be happy...

538
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,261
...and alive.

539
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,191
Sign on these.

540
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,697
It is 10 cores.

541
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,914
Thank you very much, Mr. Khurana.

542
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,588
It's a pleasure dealing with you.

543
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,130
That bloody Tharwani too...

544
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,866
He's Dawood after all.

545
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,172
When he gets down to bat.

546
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,303
...he sets the field accordingly.
Understand.

547
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,310
Stop blabbering.

548
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,882
Did you get your 15?

549
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,383
Platinum account.
What Platinum account.

550
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,417
What will I say when he asks?

551
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,180
You can see...l heard 15.

552
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,826
Everything was going fine.

553
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:48,053
But...you have to interfere,
make a mess.

554
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,797
What...

555
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:54,167
You could've made it.
- Fly over!

556
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,314
Oh s""t.

557
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:12,753
Hello, sir. We'll be there soon.

558
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,283
Sir? Sir, Who?

559
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,384
Where are you going?

560
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:19,660
Megha, you?

561
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,391
Take a right.
I thought its Sam.

562
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,890
Oh...Sam?

563
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,659
Why? So now he has got a
private number as well?

564
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,403
By the way, where are you?

565
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,106
Just outside my office.

566
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,406
Fine, I am going
to wait for your call.

567
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,748
Megha, I'll call as
soon as I am free. Please.

568
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,147
Okay, bye.

569
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,343
Mister, follow that red car.

570
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,923
They were in a bad shape.

571
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,688
I was concerned about my carpet.

572
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,333
They will be there soon. Okay?

573
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,758
You were told 6, right?

574
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:07,332
There's no delay
or rush in our business.

575
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,330
6 o'clock...means 6 o'clock!

576
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,972
Rashida.

577
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,411
I am boss's woman!

578
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,139
Hello, sister-in-law.

579
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,143
No...

580
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,510
Not his wife.

581
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:28,750
Just like you're his men,
I am his woman.

582
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:32,383
Get it?
Come on, keep the stuff in the car.

583
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,176
You asked for 15?

584
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:53,742
He did.

585
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,542
I tried to stop him.

586
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:59,050
The Boss always
forgives first mistake.

587
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,520
But second...pack up.

588
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,390
Now get lost.

589
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,225
Lets go, quickly.

590
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,226
Now that's a bomb.

591
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:15,827
Will you ask sir for her number?

592
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,405
Let's go.

593
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,240
What are you doing?

594
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,283
Come on.
We're in trouble now.

595
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,450
Easy, there's nothing in the car.

596
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,919
What the.

597
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,654
What are you doing?

598
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,052
So..
- Sir.

599
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,130
Hello, sir.

600
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,632
Satbeer, I think they're addicts.

601
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,566
Come out.

602
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,937
Search them.

603
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,531
They have nothing on them, sir.

604
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:55,666
Where do you stay?
- Mairoli.

605
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,441
So...what do you do'?

606
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,106
Do you have an ID card?

607
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,706
Show me the papers.

608
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,547
Papers! - Papers! Papers!

609
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,713
Sir, this is the only paper we have.
Keep it.

610
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,847
Fine, let's go.

611
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:14,321
Hello.

612
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,796
Hello, Chaddha uncle.

613
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,724
Throw this scrap away now,
and buy a car.

614
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,995
It just needs a little service,
that's all.

615
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,002
Not service, it's asking for retirement.

616
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,863
And next time,
don't expect me to push.

617
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:28,073
I've got better things to push.

618
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,969
I wonder what your
sister-in-law must be thinking.

619
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,245
Who sister-in-law?
- Rashida.

620
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,009
Rashida?
- Yeah.

621
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,182
We'll get married in Delhi,
Honeymoon in Dubai.

622
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,013
And then, straight to Switzerland.

623
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,190
A bullet to your head.

624
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,750
You lying on a pyre.
And straight to Haridwar.

625
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,590
Now push.

626
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,129
Nonsense.

627
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,893
You always speak negative.

628
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:52,625
Come on.

629
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,967
1, 2, 3, 4...
- Hail Hanuman.

630
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,666
Hail Bajranbali.
- It's the same thing.

631
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,242
Have you got the rent money?

632
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,745
<i>I'll pay UP-</i>

633
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:11,816
Good job, boys. Good job.

634
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,255
Anybody for a drink?

635
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,823
Come on, boys, relax.

636
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,556
We're like a family now.

637
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,199
Sit.

638
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,933
I said sit down.

639
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,440
You...here?

640
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:45,976
Why?

641
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,020
Can't I come here?

642
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,690
Of course you can.

643
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,362
But how did you get here?

644
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,240
Come.

645
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,877
Sir always says,
workers should be paid..

646
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,980
...before their sweat dries up.

647
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,048
This is 200,000.

648
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,620
Sorry, sorry... 25,000 less.

649
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,560
You can count them.

650
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:32,662
Yes.

651
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,515
I never leave anything incomplete.

652
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,153
Alcohol or...accounts!

653
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,090
We'll meet again...soon.

654
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,857
Bye.

655
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,275
What are you looking for?

656
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,210
Sam, where did he come from?

657
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,148
You fool,
you think he came from there.

658
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,976
When he can make your
account a Platinum account..

659
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:27,112
“Then, can't he get
a duplicate key to your house.

660
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:31,056
And...We're millionaires now.

661
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,127
What is it?

662
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:36,028
Hold on.

663
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,692
First ask who's at the door?

664
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,203
Who is it?
- Bhai.

665
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:46,869
Patel Bhai.

666
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,177
Prithvi..

667
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,481
Sorry, Mr. Patel.

668
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,092
We just.

669
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:06,052
What?

670
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,926
Mr. Patel. 25,000 rupees.

671
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:13,301
8 for last month, 8 for this month.

672
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,805
Good.
- And 8 for next month, advance.

673
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:22,066
And this 1000 rupees.
- Keep it.

674
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,705
All that the Lord has given us is...
Money.

675
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:33,152
Is his marriage fixed?
- Marriage?

676
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,122
That man came here in the morning,
with his daughter.

677
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,658
I just saw him leave.

678
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,285
Yes, right Mr. Patel.
It's fixed.

679
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,795
But not with his daughter.
- Then?

680
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,925
With him. Long commitment.

681
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,764
Stay away.

682
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,905
Mr. Patel, do come for the wedding.

683
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,074
You say absurd things,
don't you Sam.

684
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:00,612
Think about it.
Prithvi Weds Tharwani.

685
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:03,009
Shut up, Sam.

686
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,412
Why did you give 25 to Patel?

687
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,019
1000 rupees is a lot of money.

688
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,719
When will you stop being
a cheapskate?

689
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,819
Didn't you like throwing
the money on his face?

690
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,319
What a wonderful feeling?

691
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,264
It was a wonderful feeling.

692
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,868
Yes, sir.

693
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,441
Definitely, sir.
Yes, sir.

694
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,804
Yes, sir.

695
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,474
Yes, sir.
I'll send Sharma.

696
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,410
Yes, sir.
I'll keep you updated.

697
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,582
Thank you, sir.

698
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:37,913
Hello, uncle.

699
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,052
So Megha, how's everything?

700
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,551
I hope you didn't
have to wait too long?

701
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,285
No, and I hope I
am not disturbing you.

702
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,794
No, no, what are you saying?
Family comes first.

703
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,554
So what is it?

704
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,359
You sounded trouble
over the phone last night.

705
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,492
Uncle, l..
- Hold on.

706
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,268
What would you like to have?
- No, uncle.

707
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,931
Nothing, thank you.

708
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,972
Have some Samosas. Hold on.
- No, uncle.

709
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,110
Eat it, I'll get to eat it too.

710
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,439
Boy, get two plates.

711
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:11,477
Sharma, I am sending
you all the details.

712
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,017
Yes, fine.

713
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,148
And remember, it's 6 month
worth hard work. Don't mess it up.

714
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,393
Left it or you lost it.

715
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:19,985
Ii'.-

716
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,961
Okay, I am sending it to you.

717
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,324
<i>Okay.-</i>

718
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,426
Sorry, dear.

719
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,600
Now tell me.

720
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,149
Dear, I don't think
it's anything serious.

721
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,022
But, since you're insisting.

722
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,790
Give me his number.

723
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:02,030
Uncle, I know he's
in big trouble.

724
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,197
But I don't know why
he's hiding it from me?

725
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,171
Don't worry, dear.

726
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,733
Sometimes things seem
very complicated in life.

727
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,044
But actually,
they are quite simple.

728
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,476
Alright. Thank you, uncle.

729
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:15,516
I'll take your leave now.

730
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,051
Finish these first.
- No..

731
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,780
Look at how emotional they're looking.

732
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,910
All alone.
- No uncle, some other day.

733
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:20,886
Thank you. Bye.

734
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:23,253
Children these days.

735
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,897
Prithvi Khurana.

736
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,507
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

737
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:44,910
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

738
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,417
6 o'clock, 10 cores.

739
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,921
At Shipra Mall, parking lot.

740
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:56,423
"Its destiny...stare all you want."

741
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,622
"That's fate...it changes
color all the time."

742
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,863
'Dead bodies are taken to
the crematorium, not the parlor.'

743
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,870
"Sometimes it's too generous."

744
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,838
"Sometimes it's cruel."

745
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:16,708
"Looks beautiful,
but 50"" your future."

746
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,638
"lt's' no blessing."

747
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,807
<i>“Too depressing.“</i>

748
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:24,852
"Dresses up your wounds
and hurts you in the same place."

749
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,918
"It's half-headed."

750
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,716
"Falls and gets up again."

751
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:32,417
"Don't get tensed for any reason."

752
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,928
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

753
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:40,330
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

754
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,835
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

755
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,136
"It's destiny...changes
color all the time."

756
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,395
"Throws you ups and downs."

757
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,465
"Humiliates you.."

758
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,465
"Sc"""s you from both ends."

759
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,297
"And makes you dance to its tunes."

760
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:20,000
"Gives you sweet surprise,
takes you very high."

761
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,141
"And lands you in a hole."

762
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,242
"It's half-headed."

763
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,245
"Falls and gets up again."

764
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,943
"Don't get tensed for any reason."

765
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:33,383
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

766
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:37,721
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

767
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,395
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

768
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:45,895
"It's destiny...changes
color all the time."

769
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,708
"It's destiny...

770
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,812
"It's destiny...

771
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,218
"It's destiny...stare all you want."

772
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:09,690
"It's destiny...
changes color all the time."

773
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,819
So We'll keep them in the
loop about the design. Yeah.

774
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,259
Sure.

775
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,994
I'll just join you.
- Okay.

776
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,932
Hello, uncle.
Find out anything?

777
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,333
Dear...
- Yes!

778
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,530
Something is terribly wrong, Megha.
- What?

779
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,475
230 incoming calls in the last month.

780
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,739
And...15 outgoing.

781
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:32,836
I don't understand.

782
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:39,444
20 calls were made to 9899997353.
- Yes.

783
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,612
Sam's number.

784
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,180
The rest are from your private
number given by me.

785
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,752
And...the 15 outgoing
calls were to your number.

786
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:50,729
But, uncle... - What uncle?

787
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,424
He's such a devoted boy.

788
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,502
You girls just need
a reason to doubt us.

789
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,731
Uncle, but.
- But he was with his friend, Wasn't he?

790
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,467
Maybe they were out
running some chore.

791
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,639
But if you still suspect him,
you can ask.

792
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,271
Fine.

793
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,745
Thank you, uncle.
I troubled you for no reason.

794
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:10,374
Yes, you although one thing
does bother me.

795
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:14,478
230 incoming call,
and only 15 outgoing?

796
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,714
I guess he's a cheapskate.

797
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,757
Thanks, uncle. Bye.

798
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,424
What a house.

799
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:28,199
Take a look.
It's in Switzerland, only 35 cores.

800
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,669
35 cores only.

801
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:32,796
Think.

802
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,168
Think.

803
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,176
Megha and you on the ground floor.

804
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,872
Me and numerous girls
on the top floor.

805
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,744
We'll have great fun.

806
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,322
Hello.
- How are you?

807
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,861
Hi. How are you?

808
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,890
Were you expecting
someone else to call?

809
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,393
No. Why would I expect
anyone else to call?

810
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,904
Is everything okay?
- Yes, Megha.

811
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,870
But why are you asking?

812
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,840
Who was that girl
in the black Scorpio?

813
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,408
Black Scorpio?

814
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,381
I saw you there, Prithvi.
What are you hiding?

815
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:15,780
Megha...we..

816
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,250
Actually...we were on a picnic..

817
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,150
No, no...we were..
- Listen, Prithvi.

818
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,313
You're hiding stuff from me.

819
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,413
I want to know now!

820
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,058
What happened?

821
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,824
I would've never told you this, Megha.

822
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,531
But since you saw us..

823
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:39,170
Taneja...received an extortion call.
- Yes.

824
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,737
Who? Your boss?
- Yes.

825
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,401
They were asking for 10 cores.

826
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,103
Otherwise they would've
killed Taneja and his family.

827
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,115
I just went to make the delivery.

828
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:51,641
Oh my, God Prithvi.
Why did you take such a big risk?

829
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,186
What if something had happened to you?

830
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,155
Yes, you're right. But, don't worry.
Everything's alright now.

831
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,182
I am sorry that I lied to you, Megha.

832
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,160
Megha, We're about to go on air.
- But, Prithvi.

833
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,655
I am going to have
to call you back. Bye.

834
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,324
Not bad.

835
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,163
Finally you're learning.

836
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,965
What am I doing?
- What happened?

837
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,037
Wrong. All wrong.

838
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:13,869
I will tell Megha everything.

839
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,637
I will tell her everything.
- Are you crazy, Prithvi.

840
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:20,844
Hello, Megha. I am really sorry.

841
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,913
I lied to you.

842
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,509
But it was a serious matter, Megha.

843
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:26,877
Meet me now.

844
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,048
I will tell you everything.

845
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,724
I am listening.

846
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,159
Sir...you?

847
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,658
What were you going to tell Megha?

848
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,493
What would I say?

849
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,191
I would've made some excuse.

850
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,759
As long she doesn't know, she's safe.

851
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,739
Yes...l won't tell her anything.

852
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,508
10 cores...same time, same place.

853
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,070
Yes.

854
00:57:57,707 --> 00:57:59,311
The bloody coward.

855
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,082
He should've gone to the police.

856
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,086
And why did he involve you?

857
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,884
Megha, he trusts me.

858
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,527
And these things are easier to say.

859
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,188
But someone who's
been through it knows.

860
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:13,163
But, Prithvi,
you should've convinced Taneja.

861
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,827
And you could've told me.
You know Chhada uncle is always there.

862
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,496
And Taneja must
have contacts as well.

863
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,574
I guess, when your kin are in danger.

864
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,169
...everyone falls weak!

865
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,515
Yes.

866
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,254
Everyone does it for their kin,
Prithvi.

867
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:41,187
But only you help others
in their problems too.

868
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,462
You even do wrong things,
the right way.

869
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,230
My baby...

870
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:54,339
...l know, you were trying to help him.

871
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,238
Well, at least you're okay.

872
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,342
How's your job?

873
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,313
And, have they taken
a decision on your designs?

874
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,315
No, not yet.

875
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:06,249
I guess it will take
couple of more weeks.

876
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,683
It's the same story everywhere.

877
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,359
Set your mood straight.

878
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,385
Let's go watch a movie.

879
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,358
JAM has an offer for couples.

880
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,194
Two tickets for the price of one.

881
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,232
Really?

882
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,030
Let's watch the 6 o'clock show.
- No, no.

883
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,228
Not the 6 o'clock show.

884
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:24,101
Don't they have any afternoon show?

885
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,934
Actually,
it's very crowded in the evening.

886
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:29,472
I don't think We'll get tickets.

887
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,642
I sea.

888
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,174
Fine, let's see the 3 o'clock show.
- Yeah.

889
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,647
3 is good.

890
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,053
megha...tea!!
- Oh no!

891
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,660
Always asks me to be on time,
and she's late.

892
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,795
"Indian has managed
to save this match again."

893
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,327

Hello.

Hello...yeah!
Just a minute. Are you there already?

904
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,907
Yes, Megha. But there's bad news.

905
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,447
What happened?
- Uncle...

906
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,607
What's happened?
- Uncle! - Uncle?

907
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:46,209
Sam's uncle is dead.
- Oh no!

908
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:47,785
I am going to see him.

909
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:50,514
I mean, he's in really bad shape.

910
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,684
I'll call Sam right away.
- No, don't do that.

911
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,825
I mean...he's got to
perform all the rituals.

912
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:57,762
Yes, I understand.

913
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,322
But call me if you need anything.

914
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,164
Okay, take care.
- You too. Bye.

915
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,441
Sam!
Sam!

916
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,379
Get up!

917
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:16,850
What happened?

918
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:17,850
Get up.

919
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,783
Let me sleep.
Did you watch the TV?

920
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,615
Did you get a new one?
- Did you watch the TV or not?

921
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,987
Did you watch the TV or not?

922
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,394
Just tell me.
- Hold on.

923
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,567
Look...look..

924
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,263
And once again on News24
We're bringing news about Dawood.

925
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,465
Yes, well-known underworld Don.

This news is straight from Dubai.

928
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:47,173
He was shot dead in an
encounter with Dubai Police.

929
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:50,339
He's dead. He's dead.

930
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,315
He made us rich.

931
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,185
Nothing more to fear.
- The money is all ours.

932
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,919
"Let's Watch. . "

933
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,358
"Who's got the guts?"

934
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,161
"A little less scared."

935
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,930
"My friend."

936
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,173
Megha.

937
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,945
So this is how you
mourn someone's death?

938
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:27,749
Mourn?
- Megha, his uncle..

939
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,788
<i>Of course. course.</i>

940
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,688
Megha, my uncle's got lots of..
- Sam!

941
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,023
Can you please leave us alone?

942
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,161
I Warned you, Prithvi.

943
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,497
I want to know what happened.

944
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,768
Megha, take a seat.
- I said I want to know what's going on.

945
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,866
I'll tell you..

946
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,148
Did you know Dawood?

947
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:03,118
Do I look like someone from his gang?

948
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,384
So why did he..
- I don't know.

949
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,336
And the rest of the money.
- I was wondering the same thing.

950
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,927
I think you should tell the police.

951
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:19,064
Are you mad?

952
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:22,371
Do you think the police
will believe me so easily?

953
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,569
Why don't you just say it clearly.

954
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,509
“That, you plan on keeping
the rest of the money?

955
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:30,242
What? - Murders,
extortions.“bomb-blasts.

956
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,314
How disgusting, Prithvi.

957
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,888
I am going to Chhada uncle.
- Megha.

958
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,593
Don't scream at me.
- What else should I do?

959
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:45,329
You have changed,
Mr. Prithvi Khurana.

960
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:49,225
First you hid it from me,
and now the police.

961
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,432
Megha.

962
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:51,163
Megha, stop.

963
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:56,975
Megha.

964
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:58,875
Megha.
- What's wrong with her?

965
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,571
Nothing. I think I said
too much in a fit of rage.

966
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,742
I'll go calm her down.
- Relax.

967
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,347
Listen to me,
she'll come back herself.

968
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,050
She's become too arrogant.

969
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,056
...because you give
her too much impedance.

970
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:14,386
And anyway,
you're a billionaire now, right?

971
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,423
Come on.

972
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:18,765
No, Sam.

973
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,831
Nothing's more
important than Megha.

974
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:30,309
Megha.

975
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:33,076
Megha, it's not what you think.

976
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:34,705
There's nothing on my mind.

977
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:37,714
You really think I
want to keep that money?

978
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:56,799
If it was just about me..

979
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:59,772
“Then, I would've gone to the police.

980
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,704
But there's nothing more
important for me than you.

981
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:07,945
Tell me.

982
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:14,079
We'll go to Chhada uncle.

983
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,818
But before that I need
to prove I am not a criminal.

984
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,291
Don't get me wrong.

985
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:28,031
I am not wrong, Megha.

986
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:30,469
I am not wrong.

987
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:36,900
But don't ever lie to me again,
Prithvi.

988
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:40,740
Never.

989
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,381
I promise.

990
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,450
I love you a lot, Megha.

991
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,321
I will never lie to you again.

992
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,091
Fortune is smiling on us, but no.

993
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,059
We're happy the way we are.

994
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,664
It's either whisky or water or ice

995
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:05,361
Never all three.

996
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,264
I don't remember
when was the last time..

997
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,865
...l had a decent peg.

998
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,472
God doesn't give this
opportunity to everyone.

999
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,144
The rest is your choice.

1000
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:16,441
No, Sam. Anything
wrong can never be right.

1001
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,614
Poison is also used
to make life-saving drugs.

1002
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,919
Things aren't right or wrong.

1003
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,816
It should be used in the right way.
- Correct!

1004
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,352
And the right way is..

1005
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,155
“That we go to the police.

1006
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:30,789
Whether you go to Chhada or the CM.

1007
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:33,425
Until yesterday,
you took my advice when you were 50""

1008
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,793
Now listen to this.

1009
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:37,536
For a week we've been
living on someone else's terms.

1010
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,708
Before life is back on the rocks,
let's live it out one night.

1011
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,304
Carefree...

1012
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,303
On our own terms.

1013
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,347
You can do whatever you want.

1014
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,011
I want nothing to do with that money.

1015
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,413
What's your problem, Megha?

1016
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:53,420
You're the only one with the problem.
- Hold on, guys. Hold on.

1017
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,345
Who says we need to spend that money?

1018
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,950
Sam, you want to have fun, don't you?
- Yes.

1019
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:01,653
<i>Okay.-</i>

1020
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,324
Today the party’s on me.

1021
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,031
Yes!

1022
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:18,871
Move!

1023
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:22,748
Party!

1024
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,742
"Cars can't travel without petrol."

1025
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,750
"Petrol."

1026
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,817
"Bullets can't fire without pistol."

1027
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,981
"Pistol."

1028
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,821
"Cars can't travel without petrol."

1029
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,486
"Bullets can't fire without pistol."

1030
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:45,031
"Just like that baby..."

1031
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:47,727
"No drinking means no control"

1032
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,235
"Fan of your smile."

1033
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,395
"Camera on your mobile."

1034
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,905
"Use it with me sometime."

1035
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,408
"Use it with me sometime."

1036
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:57,466
"Be...naughty..."

1037
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:00,240
"Be naughty..."

1038
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,646
"Click selfies..."

1039
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,276
"Be naughty..."

1040
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,820
"Click selfies..."

1041
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,322
"Be naughty..."

1042
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,719
"Get drunk and click selfies..."

1043
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:15,261
"Be naughty..."

1044
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,057
"Click selfies..."

1045
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,507
"Click it... When will you click it?"

1046
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,804
"When will you click my pics?"

1047
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:33,710
"Baby. . "

1048
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,552
"First promise me.. Promise me.."

1049
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:47,924
"Won't click my naughty pics."

1050
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:48,927
"Or you'll get beaten up."

1051
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:50,930
"Beaten up.
- By Who"

1052
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,125
"My dad will beat you up."

1053
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:55,331
"Beat me.."
"Beat me?"

1054
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:58,132
"I guess your dad's
never heard about Meet."

1055
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,069
"We've kept a party
after taking a loan"

1056
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,507
"After partying hard,
she asks who you are."

1057
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:06,078
"Look me up on Google."

1058
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,647
"I am a boy very well known."

1059
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,877
"Very well known."

1060
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:13,351
"Huge goggles and eyes are small."

1061
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,854
"Wearing high heels she looks so tall."

1062
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,491
"Just like Sunny Leone..."

1063
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,084
"Become my Baby Doll."

1064
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,662
"Fan of your smile."

1065
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:23,856
"Camera on your mobile."

1066
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,229
"Use it with me sometime."

1067
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,731
"Use it with me sometime."

1068
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:31,097
"Be...naughty..."

1069
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,731
"Be naughty..."

1070
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,172
"Click selfies..."

1071
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,836
"Be naughty..."

1072
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,141
"Click selfies..."

1073
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,945
"Be naughty..."

1074
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,279
"Get drunk and click selfies..."

1075
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,912
"Be naughty..."

1076
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,421
"Click selfies..."

1077
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:06,363
"Say yes...my boy...
don't bother me."

1078
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:11,275
"Say yes...my boy...
don't bother me."

1079
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:16,505
"Say yes...my boy... hold my hands."

1080
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:21,611
"Say yes...my boy...
don't bother me."

1081
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,880
"Fan of your smile."

1082
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,390
"Camera on your mobile."

1083
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,983
"Use it with me sometime."

1084
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,427
"Use it with me sometime."

1085
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:31,589
"Be...naughty..."

1086
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:34,291
"Be naughty..."

1087
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:36,730
"Click selfies..."

1088
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,329
"Be naughty..."

1089
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,735
"Click selfies..."

1090
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,243
"Be naughty..."

1091
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,877
"Get drunk and click selfies..."

1092
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,448
"Be naughty..."

1093
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,549
"Click selfies..."

1094
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,619
"Be naughty..."

1095
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:57,050
"Get drunk and click selfies..."

1096
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,649
"Be naughty..."

1097
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,557
"Click selfies..."

1098
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,361
"Be naughty..."

1099
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:11,670
"Be naughty..."

1100
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:17,209
Megha, I love you.

1101
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,405
Finished celebrating my death?

1102
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,047
Who?

1103
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,046
I Warned you...

1104
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,585
Don't lay eyes on my money.

1105
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:36,585
Now go find your Megha.

1106
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,266
Megha.

1107
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:48,634
Megha.

1108
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:49,300
Megha.

1109
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:58,941
Megha. Megha.

1110
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:00,345
Megha.

1111
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:01,352
Megha.

1112
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,356
Oh, God! Oh no!

1113
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,254
Megha. Megha.

1114
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,382
Megha.

1115
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:08,792
Megha. Baby, are you okay?

1116
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,563
Megha.

1117
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:14,556
I won't spare whoever did this, Sam.

1118
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,398
Megha.

1119
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,960
Megha. Megha.

1120
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,538
I can't leave her alone, Sam.
- You go.

1121
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,538
I'll take a taxi.

1122
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:34,453
Hi.

1123
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:38,287
I told you,
no one should get physically hurt'?

1124
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:39,425
Why did you do it?

1125
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,461
This was the only way to stop Prithvi.

1126
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:44,396
What nonsense?
He Wasn't going to the police.

1127
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:47,730
But, Sam, I thought...
- I was here to think.

1128
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,734
What do you mean?

1129
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:53,865
We keep our share, he keeps his

1130
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,866
And next time,
you ask me before taking any step.

1131
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,411
Got it?

1132
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,720
I am so sorry, Megha.

1133
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:20,992
I am so sorry.

1134
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,114
Prithvi.

1135
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:22,360
Who?

1136
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:23,890
Prithvi.

1137
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,012
Sam, what happened?

1138
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,047
Sam. Say something.

1139
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:49,887
Sam'?

1140
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,959
I made a big mistake.

1141
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,121
Where are you coming from?

1142
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,262
You will never forgive me.

1143
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,327
Come on, let's go to the police.
- What's Wrong?

1144
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,039
Did Davvood's men..
- There's no Dawood.

1145
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,402
It's all a lie!

1146
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:13,641
What?

1147
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,777
I shouldn't have believed her.

1148
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:19,551
Who?

1149
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:21,981
Rachael.

1150
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,017
I mean Rashida.

1151
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,591
New Year's Eve, Goa.

1152
01:16:47,636 --> 01:16:48,842
Hello.

1153
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,042
Excuse me, that was my drink.

1154
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,915
Vic, give this man what he Wants.

1155
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:57,914
It's on me.

1156
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:03,588
Looks to die for,
and money to spend on me.

1157
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,856
My dream girl.

1158
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,525
The amazing thing was
that she was in love with me.

1159
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,434
Do you know why I love you so much?

1160
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:14,996
Because I am tall...dark and handsome.

1161
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,577
No?

1162
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,740
It's because you're full of life.

1163
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:23,005
Just like me.

1164
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:26,348
I see, show me.
- What are you doing?

1165
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:30,255
Just checking to see
if you're made in heaven.

1166
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:34,424
Like every day,
I was chatting with Rachael online.

1167
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,893
She wished me good luck
and sent me a link to a site.

1168
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,426
I clicked on it.

1169
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:42,058
And a window to a
lottery site popped up.

1170
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:49,565
I needed a debit card
to play the lottery.

1171
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,613
My card was declined, as always.

1172
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,311
So...

1173
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,316
I had completely forgotten
about the lottery.

1174
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,323
And one day I received a mail.

1175
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,854
Jackpot.

1176
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,624
1.5 crore pounds.

1177
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,524
I went crazy.

1178
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,295
100 crore rupees.

1179
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:17,330
I couldn't believe that.

1180
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,895
...someone's fate
could change like this.

1181
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,341
But then I thought "Whose fate".

1182
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,566
Because the money was in your name.

1183
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,041
...and transferred to your account.

1184
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,043
50 for you, and 50 for me.

1185
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,375
I'll say that clearly to Prithvi.

1186
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,310
And he will agree.

1187
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:37,086
Legally, this is all his money.

1188
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,592
We're talking about 50 cores, Sam.

1189
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,260
Brothers don't trust each
other when it comes to money.

1190
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,955
Prithvi is just your roommate.

1191
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,866
I also thought you will
never give me my share.

1192
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,267
And then...Rachael suggested a plan.

1193
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:59,405
Only one man could help us now.

1194
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:00,476
Tharwani.

1195
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:04,741
But...it would be illegal, right'?

1196
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,280
Sir, We're just taking his name.

1197
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:11,180
We're not actually
working with Dawood.

1198
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,253
No need to worry.

1199
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:15,592
And I know Prithvi too well.

1200
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,358
You just.
- But still.

1201
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:21,164
Mr. Thawani,
2 cores is not a small amount.

1202
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:28,363
If you could raise it to 5...
- Done!

1203
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:30,501
Thank you.

1204
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:32,306
Thank you very much.

1205
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:34,938
Rachael would call you from a voice modulator.
- Did you go to the ATM?

1206
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:36,409
Posing as Dawood.

1207
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,480
Dawood.
Dawood!

1208
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,519
We used a software.

1209
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:49,995
...that would route calls
through Megha's number,

1210
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:54,857
Tharwani handled the bank's
legalities and paperwork.

1211
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,400
Everything was going
according to plan.

1212
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,461
We had our 40 cores.

1213
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:00,596
You're watching News24...

1214
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:04,804
But fate... - Well-known
underworld Don Dawood.

1215
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,409
Dawood actually died.

1216
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,116
We had to bring him alive.

1217
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,615
Hello, Rachael.
Did you see the news? - Yes.

1218
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,380
And to get the remaining 10...

1219
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:18,055
Let's live one night...

1220
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,215
Carefree.

1221
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,160
On our own terms!

1222
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,089
Megha. Megha. - But, what
Rachael did with Megha last night...

1223
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:25,688
...was never pad of our plan.

1224
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,235
Taxi. And last night
when I went to Rachael's home.

1225
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:35,834
Once the job is done, DK...

1226
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,975
...l am going to kill
that son-of-a-b?"

1227
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:41,312
He's just a kid.

1228
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,505
Let him do what he Wants.

1229
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:47,687
Oberoi's pressurizing me too much.

1230
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:49,747
He's giving me only 2 more days.

1231
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,748
2 days?

1232
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:54,959
We still need to get 60 cores, DK.

1233
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,589
I have a plan.

1234
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,187
And the money.

1235
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:00,994
He's asked me to wait
until 4pm tomorrow, that's all.

1236
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:02,434
Cheers.

1237
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:05,130
But I never wanted to cheat you.

1238
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,834
I would've taken my
share and gone far away.

1239
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,645
But I didn't know that.

1240
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,204
...Rachael would go
crazy for the money.

1241
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:16,373
Why?

1242
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,313
Didn't you?

1243
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:25,892
I told you...there's no
such thing as easy money.

1244
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:27,092
But no.

1245
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:29,258
You always wanted a shortcut in life.

1246
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:31,420
Did you get your shortcut?

1247
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,026
My money? My life?

1248
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,628
Did you ever think beyond that, Sam?

1249
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,232
You're a fool, Sam.

1250
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:42,635
You're being fooled since Day 1.

1251
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:44,573
This is all a trap.

1252
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:45,736
Prithvi.

1253
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,105
Megha, you don't know
he's put us in big trouble.

1254
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,915
I am ready to take all the blame.

1255
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,585
You will be fine.

1256
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:54,847
I will confess to everything.

1257
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:56,351
What do you think?

1258
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:57,946
What do you think, Sam?

1259
01:21:58,213 --> 01:22:00,625
Tharwani... Rashida,,
they will spare you.

1260
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,658
And the police will arrest
them on your statement?

1261
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,563
I have proof.

1262
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:08,899
Are you connected?

1263
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:33,921
How is this possible?

1264
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:36,051
The jackpot notification is missing.

1265
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,363
Do you remember the lottery site?

1266
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,264
Lotsofcash.com

1267
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:47,963
Oh no!

1268
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:55,777
Fake site. . fake lottery.

1269
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:57,879
It was meant only for you, Sam.

1270
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:59,107
But the money came.

1271
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,014
That Wasn't lottery money.

1272
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:02,550
It was all about the link which.

1273
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:05,420
...Rashida...Rachael sent you.

1274
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:07,654
And Oberoi?

1275
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:10,728
Who is Oberoi?

1276
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:12,563
I don't know.

1277
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,395
I heard his name for the first time.

1278
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:16,227
It's his money.

1279
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:20,106
So what's this about lottery?

1280
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:21,501
Money laundering!

1281
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,340
It's got to be.

1282
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:25,036
Prithvi,
this is definitely some racket.

1283
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,942
...for transferring money to India.

1284
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:29,447
They get the money,
and taxes on my head.

1285
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,006
Not just tax, but.

1286
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,609
...whoever owns this money
will have to disclose.

1287
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,018
...where he got the money from.

1288
01:23:35,276 --> 01:23:36,084
Infect, I'm surprised that.

1289
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,919
...you still haven't received
any notification from RBI.

1290
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:40,518
He will.

1291
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,555
But on Monday.

1292
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:45,356
Tharwani suggested that.

1293
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:48,697
He was going to notify RBI on Friday..

1294
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:51,794
...so that you don't get any
notification due to the weekend.

1295
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:55,638
And we would've gone
far away by Monday.

1296
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:59,169
It's important to prove
where he got the money from.

1297
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,174
And who transferred it.

1298
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:04,242
Or else We'll all be dead.

1299
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,145
So then let's not waste any time.

1300
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:09,184
Let's go to Chhada uncle right now.
He'll know what to do.

1301
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:10,378
No, Megha.

1302
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,987
Now only Oberoi can save us.

1303
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,195
Oberoi?

1304
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,194
Meaning...

1305
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,899
To hell with decency now!

1306
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,148
"No one talks decently these days."

1307
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:37,274
"The night's still young..."

1308
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,743
There must be thousands
of Oberois in Delhi.

1309
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:45,119
But only a few that deal in billions.

1310
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,720
Megha, use your news
center’s database.

1311
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:52,026
...how many Oberoi's net
worth is more than a billion.

1312
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:53,228
Sam.

1313
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:55,034
Do you still have the software.

1314
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:57,501
...you used to route your
calls through Megha's phone?

1315
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:00,732
Actually, Rachael has it.
- Great.

1316
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:02,670
Because We're going to see her now.

1317
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:05,609
"All the tales of decency that we'd heard..."

1318
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:09,170
"Are all wrapped up <i>&</i> tucked away."

1319
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:12,410
"The place where we
built our dreams."

1320
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:15,421
"Is being threatened by plunderers."

1321
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:25,156
"Either you go corrupt,
or sweat it out."

1322
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:28,359
"Because to hell with decency now."

1323
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:31,597
"Because to hell with decency now."

1324
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:35,163
"Because to hell with decency now."

1325
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:40,602
No worry, baby.
I got a surprise for you.

1326
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:44,050
"There's noise from everywhere."

1327
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,315
"Someone earns <i>&</i> someone else benefits."

1328
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:47,885
You always asked...

1329
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,047
...when I will introduce
you to my parents.

1330
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,648
Well, here come mom and dad.

1331
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:57,522
"It's either the Devil or the deep sea."

1332
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:03,560
"Either you go corrupt,
or sweat it out."

1333
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,902
"Because to hell with decency now."

1334
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:09,068
Any leads?

1335
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:12,002
Ramcharan Oberoi, Builder.

1336
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:13,374
Net worth 1200 cores.

1337
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:16,643
Tejinder Oberoi, Hotelier.
Net worth 2500 cores.

1338
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:18,718
And Dev Dayal Oberio, Exporter.

1339
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:22,277
Net worth 5600 cores.

1340
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:25,482
If our Oberoi is one of them...

1341
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:27,750
“then, he won't care
about losing a few 100 cores.

1342
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:28,623
Exactly.

1343
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,496
And all three are highly
respected people in the society.

1344
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:32,861
They are all absolutely clean.

1345
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,696
Yeah... with money comes respect.

1346
01:26:37,425 --> 01:26:39,735
We don't have the time
to think about all that.

1347
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:41,098
Let's go.

1348
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:32,247
Inky-pinky-Ponky.

1349
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:33,621
Sam.

1350
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:35,584
Tejinder.

1351
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,336
Hello.

1352
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:55,377
Hello.

1353
01:27:58,006 --> 01:27:58,882
Good evening, sir.

1354
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:01,453
This is Samuel Lawson,
from Care about Hair.

1355
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:04,715
If I may ask, what hair type are you?

1356
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,759
Curly...or silky straight.

1357
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:08,527
I'm not interested, thank you.

1358
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:10,688
It's a hair-raising offer, sir.

1359
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:13,923
Next.

1360
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,863
Yeah. <i>. .</i> next.

1361
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,768
Dev Dayal Oberoi.

1362
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:35,219
Prithvi,
I think he's grown suspicious.

1363
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,956
'Please stay online...
or call after sometime.'

1364
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:45,093
It's a stupid plan.

1365
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:49,025
Come on, dial the third one.
- Yeah.

1366
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:53,668
Ramcharan Oberoi.

1367
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:58,843
Good evening, sir.

1368
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,407
Hello.

1369
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:07,047
Hello. Hello.

1370
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,525
Cannot talk right now.

1371
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:15,955
The car is outside, load the money.

1372
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:26,629
DL 9C QS 2232.

1373
01:30:46,808 --> 01:30:47,684
Stupid.

1374
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:49,921
The problem's with you, not the car.

1375
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:52,516
Let's go.

1376
01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:18,708
Oberoi?

1377
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:20,478
Hello.

1378
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:22,620
Malchamarg.

1379
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:24,588
Make the delivery in 60 minutes.

1380
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:27,022
Sir, I didn't understand.

1381
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:28,783
Malchamarg.

1382
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:30,055
60 minutes.

1383
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:32,026
What didn't you understand?

1384
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:34,191
No..
- Is there a problem, Tharwani.

1385
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:36,565
No, sir...it's alright.

1386
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:38,702
Stop the car.

1387
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:50,478
The call...

1388
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:52,209
Bloody hell.

1389
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,545
Sir, there's the car.

1390
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:27,650
Yes, Mr. Mittal.

1391
01:32:27,808 --> 01:32:29,685
I need 20 cores urgently.

1392
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:31,621
But only for few hours.

1393
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,625
Call me back please.

1394
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:39,993
Sir, this account's been frozen.

1395
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:42,364
An FIR was filed against
this account this morning.

1396
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:45,768
Who did it?
- Account holder Prithvi Khurana.

1397
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:53,439
Bloody hell.

1398
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:16,962
Hello.

1399
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,364
Why did you freeze your account?

1400
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,702
Who is this?
- DK Tharwani.

1401
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:23,833
Who Irani?
- Why did you freeze your account?

1402
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:27,104
Sir asked me to freeze the account.

1403
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:30,512
When did...Sir call?

1404
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:33,245
He called me this morning.

1405
01:33:33,407 --> 01:33:35,250
Is Sam with you?

1406
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:37,950
No, he left for Kanpur last night.

1407
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:39,787
He said he'll return in a week or two.

1408
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,123
Come to my office right now.

1409
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,257
<i>Okay.-</i>

1410
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:47,896
Rachael, you...

1411
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:57,304
Sir, Mr. Prithvi Khuranna is
Here to meet you himself...

1412
01:33:58,466 --> 01:33:59,410
Himself?

1413
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:01,174
Send him in!

1414
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:27,397
What's this?

1415
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:31,202
Your application...
to activate your account.

1416
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,609
I don't have a death-wish.

1417
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:40,381
You'll be fine, my guarantee.

1418
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:43,444
Your guarantee's worth nothing,
Mr. Tharwani.

1419
01:34:43,844 --> 01:34:46,017
You just work for Him as well.

1420
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:49,185
I had a word with him,
and he's told you to do so.

1421
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:50,691
I see.

1422
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:51,761
He..

1423
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,997
I don't have the time for all
this so why don't you sign the paper.

1424
01:34:58,092 --> 01:35:00,766
Now I know why don asked
me to freeze the account.

1425
01:35:00,828 --> 01:35:03,741
Don! Don! Don! There's no Don!

1426
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:06,402
No Don!

1427
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:09,140
And the phone calls?

1428
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:12,646
Rashida used to make those calls.

1429
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:15,744
Rashida.
- She worked for me.

1430
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:17,485
So ask her to call me.

1431
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:21,424
The b"""h ran off with my money,
with Sam.

1432
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:23,352
Sam'?

1433
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:25,254
Your money?

1434
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:27,727
<i>What are you saying,
Mr. Tharwani'?</i>

1435
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:29,394
Sign the paper.

1436
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:33,701
No,Tharwani sir, please.
I'm dead anyway.

1437
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:36,041
If I don't sign, you will kill me.

1438
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:39,004
And if I sign, they will kill Megha.

1439
01:35:39,366 --> 01:35:40,936
Who?
- I don't know.

1440
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:43,581
This morning don sent some men.

1441
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:45,913
They told me to freeze the account.

1442
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:48,613
And I have to do as they say.

1443
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:50,650
I Warned you.

1444
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:53,050
Stay in your limits,
and you'll stay alive.

1445
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:55,419
I'm asking you one last time.
Think before you speak.

1446
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,593
No,Tharwani sir, please.

1447
01:35:57,852 --> 01:35:59,627
I did as I was told.

1448
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:02,630
I am telling you the truth.
Everything.

1449
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,425
Please. Please.

1450
01:36:04,959 --> 01:36:06,404
God promise.

1451
01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:22,751
Tharwani
- it's Bhai calling.

1452
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,514
Answer it, please.

1453
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:26,988
He will tell you everything.

1454
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:27,892
Hello.

1455
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:29,655
Tharwani.
- Yes, sir.

1456
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,525
Tell him that I am here. Here..

1457
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:34,327
Where's my delivery?
- It'll be done, sir. Don't worry.

1458
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,332
Ask him to speak to me personally.

1459
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:37,698
...and I'll sign immediately.

1460
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:39,033
It'll be done?

1461
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,900
I am Worried about you now, Tharwani.

1462
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:45,642
Mr. Tharwani,
tell him about Sam and Rashida.

1463
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,108
Shut up!

1464
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:49,471
Are you threatening me?

1465
01:36:49,537 --> 01:36:51,448
2, 5, 10...were fine.

1466
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:54,645
But such a big amount.
I've been against it since Day 1.

1467
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:55,752
The bank has some rules, sir.

1468
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,687
Don't try to teach Ramcharan Oberoi.

1469
01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:00,685
The police will never
arrest Ramcharan Oberoi.

1470
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:01,783
I'll be the collateral damage.

1471
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:03,225
But remember, Ramcharan Oberoi..

1472
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:07,494
...if I get arrested,
I'll take everyone with me.

1473
01:37:07,588 --> 01:37:12,970
<i>I'll decide...who stays...who goes.</i>

1474
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,739
Prithvi, listen to my story.

1475
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:58,749
This money doesn't belong to any Don.

1476
01:37:59,607 --> 01:38:00,813
It's not mine either.

1477
01:38:00,908 --> 01:38:02,478
It belongs to someone else.

1478
01:38:03,244 --> 01:38:04,780
Mr. Oberoi?

1479
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:09,585
It's...

1480
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:13,258
...a big game.

1481
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:20,506
And...our lives hold
no value in this game.

1482
01:38:23,364 --> 01:38:25,435
A huge amount was supposed.

1483
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:27,273
...to be transferred from abroad.

1484
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:29,209
We targeted Sam.

1485
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:31,338
The money would've been
transferred to his account.

1486
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,711
...and we would've
extorted it from him.

1487
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:35,876
And he would've got
stuck in the tax liability.

1488
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:38,452
No business, no proof.

1489
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:42,718
But that dog played
the lottery with your card.

1490
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:45,922
And you got in this mess.
And we had to play this game with you.

1491
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,494
But, Mr. Tharwani.
I am in big trouble.

1492
01:38:49,556 --> 01:38:54,403
Look son...you're a sensible boy.

1493
01:38:54,628 --> 01:38:57,370
I will help you out.

1494
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:00,201
This is India.

1495
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:01,871
There's always a way out.

1496
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,415
Meaning?

1497
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:06,244
Sign the paper.

1498
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:09,318
And get arrested, right?

1499
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,053
6 months, tops.

1500
01:39:13,747 --> 01:39:18,093
Infect, you'll be out
on bail in a month or two.

1501
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:22,131
I'll get you out.

1502
01:39:23,991 --> 01:39:26,301
Okay... Look up.

1503
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:30,003
I'll give you 1 crore.

1504
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:32,433
How about I pay you in advance?

1505
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:38,308
And Sam?

1506
01:39:39,873 --> 01:39:41,716
Sign on this.

1507
01:39:42,943 --> 01:39:45,355
I'll find those two.

1508
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:14,212
Really, Mr. Tharwani,
you never leave anything incomplete.

1509
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:24,862
Not even your confession.

1510
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:27,460
Hey.

1511
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:29,327
Got it, guys?
- Yeah.

1512
01:40:30,057 --> 01:40:33,129
Megha, call Chhada uncle.
- You're in a mess.

1513
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:35,332
Done. He's on his way.

1514
01:40:35,396 --> 01:40:38,536
You should've taken the 1 crore.

Prithvi Khurana.

1517

1518
01:40:50,177 --> 01:40:53,886
“Money-laundering scam
of the country.

1519
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:56,825
"The police will never
arrest Ramcharan Oberoi."

1520

"I'll be the collateral damage."

1521

"The police will never
arrest Ramcharan Oberoi."

1522
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:08,931
Call a press conference right now!

1523
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:12,737
And prepare a counter-statement.

1524
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,649
Mr. Oberoi.

1525
01:41:26,713 --> 01:41:28,715
Such a big racket,
and dangerous people.

1526
01:41:28,782 --> 01:41:31,194
And there was a threat
to your life too.

1527
01:41:31,385 --> 01:41:32,523
Danger. - Well..

1528
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:34,327
Danger at every step.

1529
01:41:35,022 --> 01:41:36,023
That's why l..

1530
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:39,902
I mean...we risked our
life to help the Delhi Police.

1531
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:43,564
The Government isn't rewarding
us with 2 cores for nothing.

1532
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:46,972
Actually,
there's another thing I want to say.

1533
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:50,442
It's not just about the reward.

1534
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:54,819
It's the duty of every
honest and brave Indian.

1535
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:57,282
Money isn't everything.

1536
01:42:01,548 --> 01:42:04,927
So, Mr. Khurana, would you
like to say something to our viewers?

1537
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:11,769
All I would like to say is that.

1538
01:42:11,825 --> 01:42:13,771
...it's important
to do the right thing.

1539
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,599
But it's also important to ensure.

1540
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:17,972
“That no one's taking
advantage of you.

1541
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:28,447
Dawood!

1542
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:44,898
"No one talks decently these days."

1543
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:48,701
"The nights are young,
no one's scared."

1544
01:42:54,535 --> 01:42:57,744
"When I tried walking down the path."

1545
01:42:57,838 --> 01:43:02,912
"I realized I was going straight."

1546
01:43:07,147 --> 01:43:10,594
"I had heard about
getting into trouble."

1547
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:13,790

01:43:48,956 --> 01:43:52,460
"Some make big bucks,
while others make nothing."

1556
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:58,537
"His gait's staggering."

1557
01:43:58,632 --> 01:44:02,603
"No matter where he goes,
he's bound to fall."

1558

"Because to hell with decency now."

1561
01:44:14,514 --> 01:44:17,723
"Because to hell with decency now."

1562
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:24,434
"Again."

1563
01:45:11,938 --> 01:45:15,044
"The entire World wanders around."

1564
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:18,578
"Everyone says, it's my turn now."

1565
01:45:24,751 --> 01:45:26,287
"You'll keep swearing."

1566
01:45:26,353 --> 01:45:27,855
"..and this journey will continue."

1567
01:45:27,921 --> 01:45:31,596
"Don't turn a blind-eye,
or else you'll pay for it dearly."
