00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:55,895
Hi Subbu!

2
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,403
-Hi!
-You didn't come to walk yesterday?

3
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,155
My granddaughter missed
her school bus yesterday

4
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:00,355
I went to drop her.

5
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:03,588
The traffic was bad. It's better to go
to Vijayawada than drop kids in the city

6
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:07,070
You should've joined her in
a school in Vijayawada then

7
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,204
Joining her isn't enough.

8
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:12,813
My daughter-in-law would even
ask me to give her lunch box

9
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,190
You are lucky enough not
to have these hassles

10
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,457
Well, some hassles aren't evident!

11
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,691
Rambo!

12
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,252
Hey stop!

13
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,450
Why is it barking?

14
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:25,914
That's what I don't get it

15
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:29,534
Why don't you look for the
right partner for this one?

16
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:32,555
Having pets also means you have
to take care of their other needs!

17
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:33,793
That's too much now!

18
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:35,948
-Hey Rambo!
-Rambo!

19
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:38,064
Rambo.. stop!

20
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:50,758
Breaking news

21
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:54,864
The corpse of a 15 year old student
Samyuktha murdered in Hyderabad...

22
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,410
was wrapped in a polythene
cover by the murderers...

23
00:03:57,642 --> 00:03:59,677
and placed it in a waste
pipeline near Durgam Cheruvu

24
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:03,098
The cops have ceased the dead body
and are investigating the case

25
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,030
But, the reasons for the
murder haven't been found yet

26
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:10,319
Accordin the the people who came
for a morning walk to that area

27
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,522
...it's known that the dogs
have found the body first

28
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,203
THE DEMON

29
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:34,095
Cut it! Okay, play back!

30
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:40,576
We need a close up shot of the knife
with blood on it. Don't forget it

31
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,681
The producer is refusing it as we won't
get a U certificate if we show blood Arun

32
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:44,739
Ah!

33
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,363
Why do you place the alarm at my ear?
Turn it off!

34
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,281
-Ah! I am unable to turn it off!
-Eh?

35
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:12,463
15 YEAR OLD GIRL
BRUTALLY MURDERED

36
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:24,456
My name is Arun

37
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:29,952
These are the articles of 100s of
psychopathic murders in the world

38
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:34,872
My dream is to see my name on
the screen as 'A Film by Arun'

39
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,733
These are all the home work and
detailed study I did for that

40
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,553
Hey Arun...

41
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:46,378
we must be at the office before
the Rahukaala (inauspicious time)

42
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:47,654
Come soon man!

43
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,693
Arun, so what's the
producer count now?

44
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,406
Stopped the count long back uncle!

45
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,627
All the best

46
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:04,873
See you uncle

47
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:06,475
Opening shot...

48
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:08,694
Top angle camera shows a girl
crossing the road in a hurry...

49
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:10,109
and two guys are chasing her

50
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:13,243
Your story is indeed quite a thriller,
but...

51
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,245
It's too dark from the beginning,
It's not practical

52
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,699
The story is good, but family audience
won't turn up for such a movie

53
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:23,628
I think it's good if you create an
item song situation in the climax

54
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:27,352
Would you sell me your story?
I'm okay only in that case

55
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:40,687
You have been toiling
really hard to make a movie

56
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,140
But the producers are wasting your
toil on the name of current trend

57
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:46,465
I'm sure that won't happen dude

58
00:07:46,707 --> 00:07:47,504
The trend will change

59
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:49,636
Two movies are in progress already,
we shall see it the next time

60
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:51,145
Did you make any short films?

61
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,557
How will I make a short film
when I can't even afford my food?

62
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:55,676
Is this how movies were
made in the past 75 years?

63
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:58,883
Damn!
Someone who can't realise my 8 year effort

64
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:00,946
what could he possibly notice
in an 8 minute short film?

65
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:08,237
It's been more than an year
since your dad passed away

66
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:11,098
Though he didn't leave
behind comfortable wealth for us

67
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,438
He sure earned a good
reputation in the department

68
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:16,395
Which is why you are eligible
for his Sub Inspector post

69
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:20,188
Your brother-in-law is ready to get
that job for you once you say yes

70
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:23,967
Arun, just attend the SI exam
and I'll take care of the rest

71
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:25,507
-Arun!
-Huh?

72
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:26,666
Shot ready!

73
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:28,697
Hey Arun!

74
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:32,187
Arun, what about
this month's rent?

75
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:33,226
Don't you want to play
that corpse character?

76
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,659
Huh? All the best!

77
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:38,026
We end the film with a
great action episode sir

78
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,353
-I loved the story
-Thank you ma'am!

79
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,242
Collect the advance tomorrow

80
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:43,255
-What happened?
-The producer gave his nod!

81
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:44,966
-The film got the nod!
-Wow! Congrats Arun!

82
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,028
You've achieved what you dreamt of!

83
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:47,964
Roll camera!

84
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:49,091
Action!

85
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:52,650
I checked our
horoscopes yesterday

86
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:54,863
Looks like our combination
wouldn't succeed

87
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:57,970
Please understand. I'm sorry.

88
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:05,997
Don't worry brother.

89
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:08,803
You keep trying.
I'll join a job and go to work if required

90
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:09,520
Mom!

91
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:12,683
You are 22 years old already. I'm
unable to answer the people around

92
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:14,984
I'm asking you for the last time...

93
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,715
Would you get into that job or not?

94
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,251
Sir, we shot the corpse
from different angles

95
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,375
We'll show a black car pass it closely

96
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,453
Producer sir had asked me to come today

97
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:40,968
Can you inform him Arun is here?

98
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:43,338
Sir isn't here.
He has gone to Mumbai for a shoot

99
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,635
He'll be back after six months

100
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:58,559
Mom, I'll meet brother-in-law

101
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,446
Your father's reputation
will ensure you this job

102
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,963
You have no idea about the competition
and politics going on for this SI post

103
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:11,548
Can I trust you and apply for it?

104
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,587
What Arun? Did you quit Direction
and start an acting career?

105
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:30,429
It's indeed acting

106
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,781
What about direction then?

107
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,917
Fate should cooperate!

108
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:36,536
What about my dead body character then?

109
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,648
We'll plan that soon

110
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:41,156
Huh? I might become a corpse by then!

111
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:42,301
All the best!

112
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:43,357
Hey Arun.

113
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:46,607
Forget your film craze and
concentrate on your duty

114
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,819
Just obey whatever your higher
officials order you to do

115
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,672
That's what everyone does here

116
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,690
-Did you get it?
-Yeah, okay

117
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,902
-Good morning sir
-Good morning

118
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:05,736
Sit down. I've got a work outside

119
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:08,468
Once I'm back, I'll explain you your duty

120
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:10,761
Yashwanth! Order two tea!

121
00:11:10,968 --> 00:11:11,442
Okay sir

122
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:13,758
<i>I don't know anything sir!
I didn't commit that theft</i>

123
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:16,158
<i>I didn't commit that theft!</i>

124
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:17,678
<i>Sir no!</i>

125
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,349
<i>Tell me!</i>

126
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:21,447
-I didn't commit that theft
-Tell me!

127
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:24,418
-I don't know anything sir!
-Tell me!

128
00:11:24,513 --> 00:11:26,958
Come on tell me!

129
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,269
Hey... come here

130
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:34,523
Are you the newly joined one?

131
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,275
Thrash him till he reveals the truth

132
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:39,497
Sir, I just joined today

133
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:40,496
So?

134
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,654
Is there a rule that you
shouldn't thrash on the first day?

135
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,174
Do what I said

136
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:51,161
Sir... please no...

137
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:53,892
Why do you look around when
I said thrash like a cop?

138
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:57,108
You should hit like this...
this... here...

139
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:01,777
No sir... please!

140
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:04,253
Don't you have any sense Arun?

141
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:06,339
I asked you to take this
accused to the court

142
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,740
and you are narrating your script
to a producer along with him?

143
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,951
What if he had escaped?

144
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,985
No sir. I wouldn't have escaped.

145
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:14,734
SI sir's story was awesome!

146
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,157
-You...
-Sir

147
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,047
This is the last time

148
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,432
If this repeats...

149
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:28,980
No

150
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,893
Puppy! Come... come!

151
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:29,798
How many times have I warned
you not to come out without me?

152
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,135
You have to be punished. Dirty fellow...

153
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,155
Look, your face is covered in dust

154
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:35,564
Oh no!

155
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:55,255
How many times do I tell this girl?

156
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,022
I have to be dead scared once it's dusk

157
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:03,922
I'll complain about her to her
dad once he comes back today

158
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:09,196
What Amrutha? Don't you respect my word?

159
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:11,698
I'll not spare you if you aren't home
by 5:30 from tomorrow onwards

160
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:14,396
Amrutha!

161
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:36,301
Weren't any of your neighbors present?

162
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:38,939
Any relatives atleast?

163
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,159
No relatives too?

164
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,897
-Uncle...
-Good morning Arun

165
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,119
What happened?

166
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,523
Murder case, Arun

167
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:48,651
What happened?

168
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:52,592
When my daughter was
studying for her exams

169
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,969
He tried to molest her in a drunken state

170
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:58,263
I tried my best to stop him, but in vain

171
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:00,546
Just because I had to
save my daughter...

172
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:02,383
I hacked him to death sir

173
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:04,491
Where's your husband?

174
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,546
It was him, I murdered sir

175
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:13,423
What exam have you got today?

176
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:15,018
Mathematics

177
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:18,441
-Uncle, is it registered in the FIR?
-We did

178
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:21,788
Tear it off

179
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:22,771
Arun!

180
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:24,533
I'll talk to my brother-in-law
and get you the order

181
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,435
You take this girl to the exam hall

182
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,003
Girl...

183
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,160
You go attend your exam

184
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:33,798
Forget the episode

185
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:36,922
-My daughter is missing sir.
-Since when?

186
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:38,822
Since 5 pm to 5.30 pm

187
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,702
-Is it 5 pm or 5.30 pm?
-Their daughter is missing

188
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:42,979
-He is a relative of our IG
-It's the time they leave the school

189
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:43,910
It's at that time sir

190
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,623
He works for the customs

191
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,636
Speed up the investigation

192
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,713
Check the CC camera
footage near the school

193
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:53,300
Also, check any CCTV footage near her home

194
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:54,641
-Yes sir
-Also...

195
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:56,491
When that girl went missing...

196
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,904
a gift box was found tied
around her dog's neck

197
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,128
Her parents are really shocked seeing that

198
00:16:05,402 --> 00:16:06,987
These are the items in the gift box

199
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:28,984
Who gave you the permission to
release the women in the muder case?

200
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:31,504
It was his own daughter
that he was mole...

201
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:35,967
That girl must be of same age as Siri

202
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:38,154
Yeah...
that sentiment could work for you and me

203
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,358
Does that mean you
leave them at your wish?

204
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,845
I didn't leave them at
my wish Brother-in-law

205
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:45,241
According to IPC section 120 states
murder for self defense isn't a crime

206
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:47,220
I released her under that
section thinking you know this

207
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,981
So, you did it according to the rules

208
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,314
Why did you forge my signature then?

209
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:52,371
What else did you expect me to do?

210
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,499
By the time the case is closed after
the formalities and enquiries...

211
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:55,749
that girl's career would be over

212
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:57,537
You can say whatever you want...

213
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,008
I'm responsible if it
becomes an issue in the future.

214
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,140
And you teach me about the sections

215
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,642
I've got to imprison you first

216
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,474
Uncle...

217
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:06,839
Uncle!

218
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,022
Do my dad's signature on my report too.

219
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:13,584
Already the assigned tasks
is giving me severe headache

220
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,044
-You want me to sign?
-Yes, you have to.

221
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,129
<i>-I'm minding just my work</i>
-Just do it.

222
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:17,655
-No... No...
-Please uncle.

223
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,214
I flunked in two subjects. He'll
skin me alive if he finds out

224
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:23,140
-Here, put his signature.
<i>-Don't bring my issues back to me.</i>

225
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:24,270
Do you get it?

226
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:29,378
Hey, a police job demands
no kindness and compassion.

227
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:32,878
If they probe this case
tomorrow, I must answer the press

228
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,774
Over that there is local politics
that we must take care of.

229
00:17:39,461 --> 00:17:41,487
Just work for the salary you are paid.

230
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:44,161
Arun, this is the first
and last warning for you

231
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:47,456
Heard that?

232
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:48,679
This is your first and last warning.

233
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,729
Your mom's not here, right?

234
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,489
She stayed back home
saying she had a headache.

235
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:56,472
Thank god!

236
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:59,151
The new teacher doesn't know
I'm Padma teacher's daughter.

237
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:00,417
So, for now, you are my dad.

238
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:02,980
Just nod to whatever she says.
Do not open your mouth

239
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:06,411
Beat me if you want in between
but do not open your mouth.

240
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,339
Please, do not open your mouth at all.

241
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:09,531
Stop it!

242
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:11,460
Excuse me, ma'am

243
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:14,244
Come in.

244
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:17,391
Please, have a seat

245
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,570
Are you really Siri's father?

246
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,369
-Ma'am.
-Unbelievable!

247
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,006
-Unbelievable? Why?
-Well...

248
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:34,240
You look very young.

249
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:35,200
Thank you.

250
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:37,333
-Looks like uncle has fallen for her.
-Um... Um...

251
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:42,237
Well, my fate. I was forced
to marry at a very young age.

252
00:18:42,985 --> 00:18:46,743
It was my grandpa's dying
wish, so I got married.

253
00:18:48,408 --> 00:18:51,272
Fine, leave it. Do you know
what your daughter did?

254
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,064
What did she do?

255
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:59,198
She has forged your signature in
the progress report card. Look.

256
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:02,446
Looks exactly like my signature!

257
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,018
But I was smart
enough to find it out.

258
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:05,210
You are brilliant, ma'am.

259
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:08,477
You did a terrible thing.

260
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:11,205
-How dare you?
-Please don't hit me, daddy.

261
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:12,713
-Sir, stop hitting her.
-Please don't hit me, daddy.

262
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:13,540
-Please, daddy.
-How can even think of doing that?

263
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,643
-How did I raise you?
-Please, daddy.

264
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:17,410
-Stop it, sir.
-Don't stop me, ma'am.

265
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,449
Tell me I say.

266
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:19,911
-Please, daddy.
-Stop it!

267
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:23,416
Okay, see you. Bye.

268
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,473
You've said you're having headache.

269
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:29,540
Why don't you rest at home instead
of straining yourself, Padma?

270
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,037
It's okay,
I don't need rest. You leave.

271
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:32,949
Okay.

272
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,818
Well, where are you headed?

273
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:37,619
Well, that...

274
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,519
Siri wanted a
scientific calculator

275
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:40,993
I thought of gifting
it to her as a surprise.

276
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:44,300
This is fine but do not
spoil her by giving money.

277
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:45,325
Fine, come on

278
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,945
How can you even hit a girl in that way?

279
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:50,411
Whatever. It's a serious
mistake that she has committed.

280
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:51,497
So what?

281
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:53,941
You are hitting me in this way as
I don't have a mother, isn't it?

282
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:56,269
What if my mom was alive?

283
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,766
This is out of context!

284
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:01,660
Your mom's not alive, Siri?

285
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:02,724
No

286
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:06,487
Intimate me before improvising.

287
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,543
Sorry, Siri.
I won't beat you hereafter.

288
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:11,912
I will never beat you.

289
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:14,412
I am sorry.

290
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:16,310
It's okay.

291
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,862
She is becoming more arrogant
because of your pampering.

292
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,004
Okay... I will just give the
calculator as you said.

293
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,688
Okay?

294
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,859
-I'm sorry ma'am.
-Sorry, Siri.

295
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,568
Um... Oh no!

296
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:37,683
-Ma'am...
-Huh?

297
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:38,900
What happened?

298
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,057
Uh..

299
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:43,748
This girl forged her father's
signature in her progress report card.

300
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:44,510
Huh?

301
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:47,427
Is that why she is crying for?

302
00:20:47,737 --> 00:20:49,747
No. Her dad thrashed her real good.

303
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:51,227
-Huh?
-Who?

304
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,558
Yes

305
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,024
Moreover, she doesn't
have mother. Poor girl.

306
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:57,328
What? She doesn't have mother?

307
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:01,898
And who said that?

308
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,550
Well it's her father.

309
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:05,461
I swear I didn't!

310
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:07,319
-It was her father.
-Oh!

311
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:11,808
By the way, where is her father?

312
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:13,096
He is right here.

313
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,345
Sir...

314
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:29,962
-Greetings, sir.
-Greetings

315
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:31,760
-He is the father.
-Greetings.

316
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,128
Ma'am, I am her mother who passed away.

317
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,209
And I am Siri's father.

318
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:41,666
And I am Siri's uncle.

319
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:44,022
I am unmarried yet.
I'm still very young as you said.

320
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:45,246
Did she ask you?

321
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:46,981
My intent was to give little information.

322
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:49,425
Siri, what's all this?

323
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:52,456
You don't study well. you've forged your
dad's signature on the progress card

324
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:55,844
On top of that,
you make your uncle play your father.

325
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,690
What's this?

326
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:58,605
Stop accusing me alone Ma'am!

327
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:01,048
It was my uncle who failed in
forging my dad's signature.

328
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:08,635
Hmm... wow!

329
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,972
You put my signature better than me.

330
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:13,078
That's why you were caught.

331
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:15,917
Right! Felicitate him with a shawl!

332
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,134
I have told you a thousands of
times to set her right.

333
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:21,404
Don't expect me to be patient anymore.

334
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:24,220
If she is left like this,
she will take full advantage of us.

335
00:22:25,563 --> 00:22:27,295
Morever, she doesn't pay heed to my words.

336
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:29,608
Siri, do you need chutney?

337
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:31,356
Hey!

338
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:34,832
I'm talking to you.

339
00:22:35,495 --> 00:22:36,495
Yeah, tell me.

340
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:39,238
She is becoming naughty if she
stays with us due to our pampering.

341
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:42,488
If she has to be improved,
you better put her in a hostel.

342
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:46,563
Why did you come to school despite
telling that you had headache, sister?

343
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,371
I must beat you up, first!
Then everything will fall in place.

344
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:55,746
Hello. Will you find a new
school for her or should I do it?

345
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:57,921
Answer me!

346
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,457
No, daddy. Please!

347
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:17,805
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

348
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:43,775
Get lost!

349
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,592
You flicked everything
without my knowledge...

350
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,272
but there's someone above
us watching it all.

351
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,406
Fine, I'll won't tell anyone.

352
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:30,036
-Put everything back in it's place.
-Uh-uh.

353
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,160
<i>Kavya</i>!

354
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:40,344
I won't tell anyone.

355
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:46,091
Hello.

356
00:24:51,943 --> 00:24:55,940
How many times have I told you to run
to me when strangers approach you?

357
00:24:56,431 --> 00:24:59,598
They'll look decent.
They are very bad boys.

358
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:02,966
Look... be careful!

359
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:12,521
Come on, it was after all a signature
and you look at me as if I'm a criminal.

360
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:15,120
Well, even a small crime
makes you a criminal.

361
00:25:23,236 --> 00:25:25,151
-Yes, brother-in-law?
<i>-Got the photos?</i>

362
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:26,176
Got them.

363
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:28,432
<i>You have to submit them to Lakshmi
madam tomorrow morning. Be careful.</i>

364
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,528
Okay, brother-in-law.

365
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:44,512
Why did you bring all these? Don't
you already have a lot of them at home?

366
00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:46,100
Go, put it back.

367
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:57,713
You little demon! You turned
out into a mobile market!

368
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,667
Go, put them back.

369
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:01,899
Ma'am, you need not return.

370
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:05,405
Sorry. She is a little girl
not vary of her actions...

371
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,723
Ma'am, the bill was already paid.

372
00:26:07,535 --> 00:26:08,367
By whom?

373
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,411
Look, the sir who is just leaving

374
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:07,973
Hey...

375
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:12,019
Don't you link up Samyukta's murder and
Amrutha missing case with that doll's head

376
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,353
That doll's head is the
only evidence we got

377
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,546
We have to move this case using that

378
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,340
I know how to move this case

379
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:21,219
No brother-in-law, if you must
support me, we can catch him for sure

380
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,335
Don't strain too much

381
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:26,031
David Raju, who threatened
to kill Amrutha, has been caught already

382
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:27,903
The case would be closed today

383
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:29,348
You'll see it...

384
00:27:29,503 --> 00:27:30,670
The case wouldn't close
today brother-in-law

385
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,663
I don't even have the guts to propose
Amrutha with a love letter, madam

386
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,061
How can I even kill her, madam?

387
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:38,650
Then why did you run at the sight of cops?

388
00:27:38,811 --> 00:27:40,331
It was purely out of fear, madam

389
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,632
Oh god!

390
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,740
This is the right time. Shall
I talk about the evidence?

391
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,341
-Tell me the truth!
-Hey!

392
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:50,065
Lakshmi madam is very arrogant.

393
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:53,343
She won't even respond properly
to higher officials orders

394
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:55,727
Would she even pay
heed to new guys like you?

395
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:57,313
We are on the wrong route brother-in-law

396
00:27:58,187 --> 00:27:59,935
But we are on a route atleast!

397
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:03,857
Madam's torture is better than
the tough time you give me

398
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:04,480
You!

399
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,104
What's going on there?

400
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:09,329
Well ma'am, he was
inquiring about this case

401
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:14,239
You... come here

402
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,270
Take that stick

403
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:29,879
Your thrashing must make
him speak the truth!

404
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:32,985
Go now!

405
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,796
Madam, please tell him no to hit me!

406
00:28:40,258 --> 00:28:41,790
Please madam!

407
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:43,950
Hello...

408
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:45,657
Hi darling!

409
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,198
Did you have your food?

410
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:49,960
-Mommy's going to be late home...
-I am innocent, sir

411
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:53,365
-Be good. Okay? Bye!
-Please leave me sir!

412
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:57,300
Hey! Is that how you hit a person?

413
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,333
This is how you extract the truth?

414
00:28:59,475 --> 00:29:00,803
Ma'am, there is no use
in bashing him up

415
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,980
The one we're looking for isn't a rapist,
kidnapper or a one side lover like him

416
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:06,504
A mentally unstable guy who carefully
plans and kills his victim

417
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,362
In simple words, he's a psycho.

418
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:10,264
What's your crap?

419
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,600
Ma'am, just a minute

420
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:20,404
This is the photo of Samyukta,
who was missing earlier

421
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:23,726
And this is the photo of Amrutha
who went missing two days ago

422
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:26,266
The common point between these two
is that they are school students

423
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,472
And both are 15 years old...

424
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,239
Both were kidnapped
while returning from school

425
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:32,877
This is Samyukta's photo when her
corpse was found two days after kidnap

426
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:35,963
This is the photo of the doll's head found
in the gift box when Amrutha was kidnapped

427
00:29:36,134 --> 00:29:39,357
Just like Samyukta, the hair
on doll's forehead is uprooted

428
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:41,609
Just like Samyukta's eyes were
drilled and her mouth is damaged...

429
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:43,096
the same is done to the doll

430
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,532
Apart from that, on Samyukta's forehead...

431
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:49,561
on her ears and nose, the wounds seen

432
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:51,693
The same marks can be found
in the doll's face too

433
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:53,686
So...

434
00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:57,351
it's with these instances you come to the
conclusion that it's the same man...

435
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:58,922
I mean...

436
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:01,141
you say the so called psycho did this?

437
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,906
Not just this ma'am...

438
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:04,690
27% from the list of the
psychopaths across the world

439
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:08,648
leave their mark when they kidnap or
murder their victims, it's in the records

440
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:09,493
For example...

441
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:11,779
in 1970s a serial killer
named Zodiac, from America...

442
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:15,500
murdered ten people and left a
cross as his mark on the victims

443
00:30:15,754 --> 00:30:18,984
A psycho named Dennis Radar always
left a woman's form as his signature

444
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:22,343
Only when they turned it, did they
know that they were his initials 'BTK'

445
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:27,112
In Mumbai, a psycho named Ravinder placed
beer bottles as his signature near victims

446
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,434
John Allen and Malan
from Washington,

447
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:31,981
placed a card named
'Calling card' as their mark

448
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,197
Similarly, a psycho named John Fianse
left a broken cross as his mark

449
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:37,577
During 19th century, in London,
a psycho named Jack the ripper...

450
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:39,959
murdered call girls and split
their bodies into two halves

451
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:42,270
The reason they leave
their mark or sign is identity

452
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:44,205
Psychos crave for their own identity

453
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,694
Because with every attack people started
fearing their sign and in turn them

454
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:48,308
The psychopaths
enjoyed that fear

455
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,052
There are hundreds of
such examples if we go on...

456
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:51,840
This damaged doll head is one such sign!

457
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,188
He would have started enjoying the
fear he instigated on us already

458
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,696
Which is why,
let's probe in this direction ma'am

459
00:31:00,537 --> 00:31:03,857
So, you mean I'm headed
in the wrong direction?

460
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:05,254
Ma'am, I didn't meant it that way

461
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:09,846
So, when Samyukta died, no
such doll head was found

462
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:11,369
Ma'am, let's inquire that

463
00:31:12,856 --> 00:31:14,332
Okay...

464
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,903
Why are you so much interested
in Samyukta's murder case?

465
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:21,021
I had collected such
news articles for my film script

466
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,744
Oh yeah! Right!

467
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:28,061
Weren't you working as
an assistant director...

468
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:33,777
and then you became an SI using
your dad's reputation, right?

469
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:35,177
Ma'am...

470
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:36,403
Listen!

471
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:40,422
Don't vomit all those film stories here!

472
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:45,932
Use your script knowledge
only for your movies!

473
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,830
If you drag it into the investigation...

474
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:54,535
and create unnecessary confusion,
I'll kill you

475
00:31:55,483 --> 00:32:00,835
Only if you had put your creativity to
right use, you'd be director by now

476
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:06,376
You are here on our heads
because you couldn't do that!

477
00:32:06,963 --> 00:32:07,799
Ma'am please...

478
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,679
Samyukta's body was found in a tortured
condition two days after she was kidnapped

479
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:12,628
Today marks the second day
since Amrutha went missing

480
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:15,306
Ma'am if we don't take a quick action
then Amrutha might face the same plight

481
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:16,672
-It will happen
-Hey!

482
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,323
Don't you order me what to do

483
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,453
Go, get me cigarettes

484
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:25,589
Go now

485
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:28,773
I said, go!

486
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:50,988
It's me, the ACP

487
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:54,771
Keep the public or media at bay.
Don't allow photos or videos

488
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:55,634
I'm on the way

489
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:00,612
Arun, things are happening as you said

490
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:45,517
It happened exactly as the SI predicted

491
00:33:45,652 --> 00:33:46,973
Take the entire area into our control.

492
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,766
Don't let any news to the
media without my permission

493
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:49,896
<i>-Okay?
-Okay ma'am</i>

494
00:33:55,717 --> 00:33:56,397
<i>No sir</i>

495
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,257
We don't have any such gift box listed
in Samyukta's murder investigation

496
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:02,847
Please do check with her parents once

497
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:08,085
Sir, we didn't find any such gift box

498
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:10,744
Samyukta was kidnapped when she
was returning from her hostel

499
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:12,294
Maybe you could inquire at her hostel

500
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:32,632
When I was conducting the autopsy...

501
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:35,314
I couldn't control my tears

502
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:41,321
I guess,
the killer doesn't know what pain is

503
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:43,778
A demon!

504
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:47,444
Poor girl, he drilled out her eyes

505
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:52,117
Then broke her teeth...
uprooted her hair by force

506
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:56,524
Ruthlessly, he has scarred
all over body with a knife

507
00:34:57,917 --> 00:35:02,258
He did this all while
the girl was alive

508
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:07,576
This man is suffering from
Antisocial Personality Disorder

509
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:09,644
With aggression and
deviant behavior

510
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:14,113
In simple words... he is a psycho!

511
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:18,829
Completely a psycho!

512
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:23,698
Sir... was she raped?

513
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,213
Er... No rape

514
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:28,668
But...

515
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:32,894
her private parts were
utterly mutilated...

516
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:41,519
Sir... this is Samyukta's autopsy reports

517
00:35:47,531 --> 00:35:49,675
It's the same! There is no difference

518
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:54,698
She has been murdered exactly
the same way as Amrutha

519
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,942
Same person... I am sure!

520
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,177
Sir...

521
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:04,696
but we can't confirm he is the
murderer based on just these facts!

522
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:06,716
-You see...
-Ma'am... one minute

523
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:14,360
Yes sir, someone had left a gift box in
her name at the gate after she left

524
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:16,535
There... that is the gift box sir

525
00:36:25,173 --> 00:36:28,040
I forgot about the gift in
the shock of Samyukta's death

526
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:44,314
I got this from Samyukta's hostel ma'am

527
00:36:46,652 --> 00:36:49,475
What's going on, Lakshmi?
The DGP has taken me to task!

528
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:52,207
Is there a link between Amrutha's murder
and Samyukta's case that was closed?

529
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,417
And how?

530
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:56,381
Sir, if you can give me sometime...

531
00:36:57,324 --> 00:36:58,157
How much more?

532
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,627
Sir...

533
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:24,549
So according to you, if it's one
person who is behind these murders

534
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,366
What is the
link between him and the victims...

535
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:29,058
What's his motive?

536
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:32,952
How do we proceed this case further?

537
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,123
Whom do we doubt?

538
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,808
I somehow feel this case is
going to be a big headache

539
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,980
Sir, I have an idea

540
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:43,309
but there is a risk
involved in it

541
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:44,207
Tell me Arun

542
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:46,680
In this case, the mark of leaving a gift
box after kidnapping the victims...

543
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,198
then leaving the corpse
in a public place to attract attention...

544
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:52,132
All these evidently speak about the
publicity this psycho seeks sir

545
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:56,002
Like how applause and appreciation
motivates an artist...

546
00:37:56,275 --> 00:38:01,191
Psychos thrive on the attention they
get and fear people have on them

547
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:04,043
And that stable mind is what
helps them to plan their murders

548
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:07,358
In order to stop them, all we need
to do is devoid them of that thrill

549
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:09,806
If we don't focus on him,
he'll be confused

550
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,013
He'll shift his target,
he'll commit a mistake in his planning

551
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:14,815
And at that moment, we'll have
the opportunity to nab him!

552
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,204
For that, we'll have to keep
Amrutha's corpse away from everyone

553
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:20,478
Even from her parents...

554
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:25,234
Sir, please, let's try this idea

555
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,153
Hey!

556
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,796
If the information leaks later,

557
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:30,559
You're just an SI, you'll be safe

558
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:32,170
We'll face the problem

559
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:37,160
We'll have to reply to the
home minister, CM, media etc.

560
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:39,269
Ma'am this isn't gonna
stop with Amrutha's murder

561
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,620
Unfortunately,
we don't have any clue to nab that psycho

562
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:46,866
Her dead body, seeing which even the
autopsy doctor couldn't control his tears

563
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:48,351
Do her parents need to see it?

564
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:49,771
Could they bear the sight of it?

565
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:53,313
Look Arun...

566
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:56,976
We need to follow certain procedures
and ethics when we handle a case

567
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:58,706
Only then would it be good for all of us

568
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:01,352
You go and bring her
parents to identify her body

569
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,640
I'll talk to the DGP meanwhile

570
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,771
Sir, it is because normal procedure
won't work out in this case...

571
00:39:07,826 --> 00:39:08,969
I came up with this idea

572
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:09,846
Hey...

573
00:39:10,136 --> 00:39:13,748
Don't you tell us the
procedure we need to follow

574
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,875
Go now, and be on the work

575
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:32,275
-Sir...
-Show them

576
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:33,713
-Come
-Please go

577
00:39:34,548 --> 00:39:36,482
-No, I can't bear it
-That's okay, come

578
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,715
That girl wouldn't be Amrutha

579
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,168
-Why did we even come here?
-Yes, let's check once

580
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:49,760
-Kill me here if that's her
-Calm down Kamala

581
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:51,105
Please listen to me

582
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,281
Amrutha is alive!

583
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:57,577
Calm down Kamala,
it wouldn't be Amrutha

584
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:13,712
-That's not Amrutha right?
-No

585
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:14,909
Are you sure?

586
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:17,170
I am telling you the truth Kamala,
Kamala would be safe

587
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:18,802
-Calm down
-Sir...

588
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:19,988
Did you check properly?

589
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:22,922
I did check officer. That's not Amrutha

590
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:34,192
Sir, Amrutha's body...

591
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,034
Yes Arun, I discussed the points
you mentioned with the DGP

592
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,723
He has given the permission

593
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,504
Sir, then Amrutha's corpse?

594
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:42,778
This is a secret mortuary
maintained by the government

595
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,934
It looks like an ordinary medical godown
from the outside, politically supported.

596
00:40:46,134 --> 00:40:48,787
When we encounter thecriminals
who don't leave clues

597
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:51,892
we bring their corpses here

598
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:55,558
We file an absconding case on
them and fake a search on them.

599
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:58,834
One it settles down, we
dispose their corpses

600
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,685
Mr. Arun,
your thesis about psychos had logic

601
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:05,135
Whe I discussed the same with the DGP sir,
he gave the permission immediately

602
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:07,157
We shifted Amrutha's body immediately

603
00:41:07,414 --> 00:41:08,892
Doctor, can you please show us the body?

604
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,167
This mortuary is under Dr. Kishore

605
00:41:18,698 --> 00:41:20,676
Hiding Amrutha's corpse isn't a big issue

606
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,881
If that person is a psycho killer...

607
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,246
then he must be arrested
before his next attempt

608
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:43,953
Ah!

609
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:49,927
Out!

610
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:51,974
Out!

611
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,428
Come in

612
00:42:00,153 --> 00:42:01,062
Come dear

613
00:42:03,893 --> 00:42:05,256
Hello sir. I am Prasa...

614
00:42:07,723 --> 00:42:08,555
Sir...

615
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:10,735
My daughter Siri...

616
00:42:11,392 --> 00:42:12,784
She is a little weak in the subjects

617
00:42:13,337 --> 00:42:14,699
Hence, we changed her school

618
00:42:15,093 --> 00:42:18,186
I heard that you are quite strict.
Please do take care of her

619
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,129
You may leave.
I'll take care of her

620
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:25,198
Ok dear. Take care

621
00:42:28,065 --> 00:42:29,855
-Go and sit
-Okay sir

622
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,171
This model toys have been discontinued

623
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:45,211
As such dolls weren't selling,
they stopped their sales since an year

624
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,121
Only one doll is left

625
00:43:33,462 --> 00:43:34,741
This is an imported toy sir

626
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:37,151
As it's a very old model,
no one is buying it sir

627
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:39,182
So we've stopped ordering
from that company sir

628
00:43:39,546 --> 00:43:40,515
I can get it if you want.

629
00:44:00,919 --> 00:44:01,633
Dear students...

630
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:06,380
In today's world, women's
education is quite an important factor

631
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:10,980
A nations progress lies
in the education of women

632
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:16,468
India being in the first plave among the
developing countries is a pride to us

633
00:44:16,745 --> 00:44:20,657
The reason for that is the importance
we give to our country's women

634
00:44:21,387 --> 00:44:23,254
-You can't even solve a simple problem
-Ah!

635
00:44:23,543 --> 00:44:25,167
How will you pass this year?

636
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:26,764
It's hurting sir!

637
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:27,969
-Tell me
-Sir!

638
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,018
You do everything
else except studying

639
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:33,911
What do we do?

640
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:35,790
-Answer me
-Sir

641
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:38,496
The function has already started...

642
00:44:38,696 --> 00:44:40,112
You leave. We'll come

643
00:44:40,324 --> 00:44:41,332
Ah! Sir!

644
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:45,372
Tomorrow, the random person
I'll ask should solve this

645
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:46,551
Okay sir

646
00:44:46,961 --> 00:44:48,563
Or else,
the entire class will fail this year

647
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:50,117
Understand?

648
00:44:50,381 --> 00:44:52,395
-Okay sir
-Leave now

649
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:11,683
In order to achieve 100% result
in the 12th grade, our school...

650
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:14,970
We'll correct the papers
strictly in the pre-finals

651
00:45:15,563 --> 00:45:17,937
Where, even an average
student cannot clear

652
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:21,266
But you are below average

653
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:23,538
You will fail for sure

654
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,475
You shouldn't ruin my name Sharmi!

655
00:45:30,075 --> 00:45:32,649
Last week I saw you roaming
with a guy, on his bike

656
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:36,844
No sir... ah!

657
00:45:37,044 --> 00:45:38,631
You roam around a lot

658
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:42,085
You don't study well

659
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:47,513
Do I inform your parents?

660
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:50,143
-No
-Huh?

661
00:45:50,923 --> 00:45:53,052
Please sir, no

662
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:54,861
You don't want me to?

663
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,710
Yeah

664
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,671
Then will you obey me?

665
00:46:01,018 --> 00:46:02,061
Huh?

666
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,285
Tell me!

667
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:09,389
If you won't obey...

668
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:11,564
then you can leave to attend the function

669
00:46:12,868 --> 00:46:15,800
But if you want to me to
make you pass this year...

670
00:46:18,978 --> 00:46:20,424
then close the door and come

671
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:31,184
<i>Our school stands in the
first position Hyderabad</i>

672
00:46:31,808 --> 00:46:36,715
The reason is the way we educate our
children and the security we provide

673
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:40,324
<i>I congratulate all our teachers for that</i>

674
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:49,379
Now, our special guest
Mrs. Annabelle George...

675
00:46:49,647 --> 00:46:51,843
...is going to present an
interesting magic show

676
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:31,217
Ok students...

677
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:33,381
Solve this problem and come tomorrow.
Okay?

678
00:48:37,922 --> 00:48:39,180
-Padma ma'am!
-Yeah

679
00:48:40,566 --> 00:48:43,856
-Has your husband arrived?
-Yeah... He is waiting outside

680
00:48:44,108 --> 00:48:44,956
Okay...

681
00:48:45,724 --> 00:48:48,867
-Is there an improvement in Kavya?
-Ma'am!

682
00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:51,725
-Yeah, she calls out mom once in a while
-Krishna ma'am!

683
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:54,260
-I'm taking her to speech therapy tomorrow
-Excuse me... ma'am!

684
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:55,500
-Ma'am!
-Huh?

685
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:57,916
Meera! Oh sorry! I forgot

686
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:01,082
Tell me how's the gift

687
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:03,471
It's awesome

688
00:49:03,618 --> 00:49:05,616
Convey my wishes to your parents

689
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:07,909
Why don't you do it yourself?
They'd be surprised

690
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:13,378
Happy anniversary.
Wish you happy married life!

691
00:49:14,893 --> 00:49:16,901
Machine: Happy anniversary.
Wish you happy married life!

692
00:49:17,397 --> 00:49:18,063
-Thank you, ma'am
-Bye

693
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:19,230
-Bye ma'am!
-Bye

694
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,231
-Does this machine have record facility?
-Yes ma'am

695
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:26,131
I have bought a similar one for Kavya

696
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:30,239
-Recorded voice helps in speech training
-Okay

697
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:34,426
Okay, fine. So when are
you getting married?

698
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,638
I can't ignore Kavya and get married

699
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:41,338
I will marry only a
person who'll accept her

700
00:49:42,644 --> 00:49:45,393
It's tough to find someone like that

701
00:50:40,157 --> 00:50:41,749
It was our wedding anniversary yesterday

702
00:50:42,325 --> 00:50:43,978
She said she'd come home soon

703
00:50:44,093 --> 00:50:45,550
Did you inquire all
friends and relatives?

704
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:46,978
We have inquired everyone

705
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:01,861
I saw Meera boarding an auto-rickshaw,
but I don't remember its number

706
00:51:02,175 --> 00:51:04,814
Did you notice any name or poster
or any sign on the auto-rickshaw?

707
00:51:05,214 --> 00:51:06,742
No, I don't recollect

708
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,527
I left when the bus arrived that day

709
00:51:09,727 --> 00:51:10,550
Okay, please come with me

710
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:12,434
Let's check with all the
auto-rickshaws in that area

711
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:13,949
Please help me in nabbing that auto driver

712
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:16,344
I'm so sorry! I don't remember anything.

713
00:51:16,686 --> 00:51:19,610
Kavya must be waiting for me at school.
I need to start

714
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:20,533
Ma'am please

715
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:23,477
Any small information you give
can help us save the life of a girl

716
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:25,134
Sir, I am a responsible person too

717
00:51:25,342 --> 00:51:27,644
But as I said, I don't remember anything

718
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:28,918
Ma'am, please cooperate with us

719
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:30,860
Sir, don't you understand?

720
00:51:31,215 --> 00:51:34,134
Kavya might start crying and
that will make her weak

721
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:35,265
-I've got to go
-Hello!

722
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,348
We are scared with the though of
what Meera's condition would be

723
00:51:39,662 --> 00:51:41,559
Sir, I have girl child dependent on me

724
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:42,867
I must leave

725
00:51:43,356 --> 00:51:44,660
-Ma'am please!
-Sorry

726
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:56,817
Kavya...

727
00:51:57,613 --> 00:51:58,838
Stop blowing the bubbles now!

728
00:51:59,038 --> 00:52:00,137
We're delayed because of you

729
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:01,995
How long before the bus
arrives and we reach home

730
00:52:02,762 --> 00:52:04,810
I've brought you along
to the birthday party

731
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,966
you've delayed playing games

732
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:12,491
No parties and no outings from now.
That's your punishment

733
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:21,034
Auto-rickshaw! Hey!

734
00:52:27,473 --> 00:52:28,788
Kavya... Come here

735
00:52:35,477 --> 00:52:36,671
Need an auto-rickshaw madam?

736
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:38,058
There's place, please, come madam

737
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:40,855
No

738
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,196
Come madam,
you wouldn't get autos at this time

739
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,367
No

740
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,794
Come madam...

741
00:52:47,183 --> 00:52:48,038
Come Kavya

742
00:52:48,146 --> 00:52:50,163
Hey! Get in man... let's deal with her!

743
00:53:15,655 --> 00:53:16,654
-Dude...
-Yeah?

744
00:53:16,854 --> 00:53:17,773
We missed her man!

745
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:20,431
Forget it, we'll find some other chick

746
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,501
-Come on...
-Huh?

747
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,551
Hey! Who're you man?

748
00:53:28,026 --> 00:53:29,097
Are you her bodyguard?

749
00:53:29,297 --> 00:53:30,740
Eh? What?

750
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,757
I didn't know you were a cop
until you came to school for the enquiry.

751
00:54:18,215 --> 00:54:19,116
What did you think I was then?

752
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:22,686
I thought you were a jobless bachelor.

753
00:54:26,031 --> 00:54:27,791
Where is Kavya's father now?

754
00:54:28,794 --> 00:54:30,631
Kavya isn't my daughter.

755
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:33,328
I know that.

756
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:34,621
Kavya is you elder
sister's daughter

757
00:54:35,362 --> 00:54:37,037
And that she passed
away after falling sick

758
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:39,696
Her husband abandoned Kavya
because she is speech impaired

759
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:41,550
Hence you took
responsibility of Kavya.

760
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:42,450
Am I correct?

761
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:45,049
How did you get to know all these?

762
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:47,501
Siri told me.

763
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:49,289
But how did Siri know?

764
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,320
I promised to sign her report card in a
way that she won't get caught next time,

765
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:53,705
And she helped me with your details

766
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:09,826
Is this all Kavya's work?

767
00:55:10,091 --> 00:55:11,268
Yes, they are Kavya's work.

768
00:55:11,498 --> 00:55:13,007
She keeps drawing all the time.

769
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:17,007
She expresses her feelings through
these drawings since childhood.

770
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:22,112
Remember, you paid for all the
sketch pens at the super market.

771
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:26,457
Bye.
Okay, bye.

772
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,154
Kavya, no.

773
00:55:43,187 --> 00:55:43,982
Happy?

774
00:55:44,182 --> 00:55:44,697
Come.

775
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,240
Okay, Kavya...

776
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:50,823
Arun...

777
00:55:51,503 --> 00:55:52,987
Tomorrow, let's go check all
the auto-Rickshaw in that area.

778
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:54,654
I'll update you if I recollect anything.

779
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,096
Thank you.

780
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,018
Goodnight!

781
00:56:08,096 --> 00:56:11,826
"Tiny drops of rain drenched my heart"

782
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:18,270
"Small memories drizzled in the heart"

783
00:56:20,605 --> 00:56:25,090
"The age that gathers small things"

784
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:30,422
"Got to know the destiny of short sprints"

785
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:36,220
"A room inside my heart for you"

786
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:39,330
"It could conceal the sky itself"

787
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:42,393
"The thought in my eyes"

788
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,548
"is flowing like a river"

789
00:56:45,975 --> 00:56:48,861
"A second is yours and a second is mine"

790
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,433
"Which way do I go?"

791
00:56:51,798 --> 00:56:54,743
"Tiny drops of rain drenched my heart"

792
00:56:57,925 --> 00:57:02,949
"Small memories drizzled in the heart"

793
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:38,497
"I'm in search of my yesterday's dream"

794
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:44,676
"Can't get into tomorrow's thoughts"

795
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:50,838
"In the rains of these tiny memories"

796
00:57:51,532 --> 00:57:56,948
"Which way do I show my destiny now?"

797
00:57:57,319 --> 00:58:01,087
"Tiny drops of rain drenched my heart"

798
00:58:03,558 --> 00:58:07,342
"Small memories drizzled in the heart"

799
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:08,851
Hey!

800
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:14,594
"The age that gathers small things"

801
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:20,573
"Got to know the destiny of short sprints"

802
00:58:22,406 --> 00:58:26,643
"Tiny drops of rain drenched my heart"

803
00:58:28,491 --> 00:58:32,820
"Small memories drizzled in the heart"

804
00:59:23,576 --> 00:59:24,688
It's a flat tyre, Arun.

805
00:59:31,006 --> 00:59:31,839
Hello

806
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:35,292
-Stop that auto-rickshaw uncle.
-Okay, Arun.

807
00:59:37,715 --> 00:59:39,177
-Stop that auto-rickshaw.
-Hey... Auto-rickshaw...

808
00:59:41,702 --> 00:59:42,286
Stop... Stop...

809
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:43,929
<i>Stop...</i>

810
00:59:47,441 --> 00:59:48,724
Go to Habsiguda flyover.

811
00:59:53,205 --> 00:59:54,425
We are losing.

812
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:55,564
What happened, Arun?

813
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:58,121
Meera's corpse was found
at the corporation's garbage.

814
00:59:58,542 --> 00:59:59,638
What do you mean?

815
01:00:03,379 --> 01:00:04,093
-Hello
<i>-Arun</i>

816
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,105
Arun, on the back of that
auto-rickshaw in which Meera travelled...

817
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,388
Krishna, your voice is distorted.
Seems like bad signal.

818
01:00:09,588 --> 01:00:10,894
Hello... Hello, Arun

819
01:00:11,802 --> 01:00:12,775
Can you hear me now?

820
01:00:12,794 --> 01:00:15,741
Hello...

821
01:00:16,027 --> 01:00:17,384
Krishna, your voice is breaking.

822
01:00:17,436 --> 01:00:19,341
Hello Arun, can you hear me now?

823
01:00:21,335 --> 01:00:21,991
Shucks!

824
01:00:24,836 --> 01:00:25,292
Hello?

825
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,786
Arun, there is a red colour printed star
on the back side of that auto-rickshaw.

826
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:31,279
I can't hear your voice, Krishna.

827
01:00:31,853 --> 01:00:33,297
-Hello Krishna!
-Hello.

828
01:00:34,103 --> 01:00:34,871
-Hello!
-Hello!

829
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:51,025
Just remove the garbage from the top.

830
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:56,115
-Move the body slowly.
-Sir, we're from Cyberabad police station.

831
01:00:56,485 --> 01:00:58,499
It was the cleaner who saw it first.

832
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:01,776
Although in our area, they asked me
to divert the case to your station

833
01:01:02,457 --> 01:01:03,496
Get the body out.

834
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:10,330
Handle it carefully. Take it.

835
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:13,277
Get it down carefully.

836
01:01:20,915 --> 01:01:21,373
Hello.

837
01:01:21,871 --> 01:01:23,839
Arun, there was red colored
star logo on the back

838
01:01:24,074 --> 01:01:25,409
<i>of the auto-rickshaw Meera traveled.</i>

839
01:01:25,746 --> 01:01:27,361
There is a word 'race' written in English.

840
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:29,476
I had been trying to
reach you to convey this.

841
01:01:58,641 --> 01:01:59,285
Hey!

842
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:04,857
Speak up...

843
01:02:05,142 --> 01:02:06,488
Sir, I didn't murder anyone.

844
01:02:07,346 --> 01:02:10,897
I just simply tease the school
girls for timepass. That's it, sir.

845
01:02:11,033 --> 01:02:12,942
You tease school girls for timepass?

846
01:02:13,818 --> 01:02:15,374
Who else is with you?

847
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:17,278
-Speak up!
-Sobaraj, sir.

848
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:18,246
Sobraj?

849
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:21,314
I lure the school girls
into my auto-rickshaw...

850
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:22,858
...and drop them off at his house.

851
01:02:22,885 --> 01:02:27,145
My task ends there. And I really
don't know what he does to the girls.

852
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:28,331
What does Sobraj do?

853
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:29,639
He is a school teacher, sir.

854
01:02:29,739 --> 01:02:32,110
School teacher? Is this something
a school teacher would do?

855
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:33,401
Which school does he work at?

856
01:02:33,493 --> 01:02:36,617
I don't know the school.
I only know his house.

857
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,586
Why do you address him
with respect, bloody idiot?

858
01:02:39,645 --> 01:02:40,561
Where is his house?

859
01:02:40,807 --> 01:02:42,515
Gandhinaagar, Chikkadapally.

860
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:15,221
-Go that side and check
-Okay, sir.

861
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,664
-Venkat, check that room.
-Is he Sobraj?

862
01:03:20,253 --> 01:03:23,225
Oh! Siri studies in his class.

863
01:03:23,636 --> 01:03:24,360
Students!

864
01:03:25,696 --> 01:03:27,100
Did everyone get answer sheets?

865
01:03:31,742 --> 01:03:32,674
Silence.

866
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,828
Those who has secured less
than 35 percent, stand up.

867
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:42,392
Hmm?

868
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,376
Sir, this is Meera's note book

869
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:09,859
Brother-in-law!

870
01:04:16,124 --> 01:04:17,214
What's your percentage?

871
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:19,201
34, sir.

872
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:20,733
I didn't hear it properly.

873
01:04:20,933 --> 01:04:22,262
Say it out loud so that everyone hears it.

874
01:04:23,831 --> 01:04:24,799
34, sir.

875
01:04:29,217 --> 01:04:30,130
Get that and come here.

876
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:32,644
We have searched the house
completely, Arun. We didn't find any clue.

877
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,649
He will be at the school, Arun.

878
01:04:58,142 --> 01:05:01,415
-You have failed in all the tests.
-Please, sir. Leave me.

879
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:05,892
Okay, all of you leave.

880
01:05:06,455 --> 01:05:08,759
Please, sir.
Sorry, sir.

881
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:21,454
Principal has asked me to give the list of
10th class students who'd get demoted.

882
01:05:22,403 --> 01:05:24,827
I think I should put your name first.

883
01:05:25,704 --> 01:05:29,300
-Sir, please don't do that.
-You are not concentrating on anything.

884
01:05:30,285 --> 01:05:31,429
What do you want me to do?

885
01:05:31,939 --> 01:05:33,004
Huh?

886
01:05:34,479 --> 01:05:36,546
You wan't to be in the same
class the next year too?

887
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,797
I will listen to you, sir.

888
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:41,941
-Will you obey?
-I will, sir.

889
01:05:42,787 --> 01:05:44,215
Then go close that door and come.

890
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:48,957
Go

891
01:06:26,842 --> 01:06:28,891
Sir, please don't do this.
Please let me go.

892
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:31,256
I'll count up to ten.

893
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,876
-Please sir, I plead you.
-One.

894
01:06:44,072 --> 01:06:46,586
-Please leave me, sir.
-Two.

895
01:06:47,547 --> 01:06:48,762
Where is Sobraj teacher?

896
01:06:48,874 --> 01:06:51,634
He will go to Ameerpet
tuition centre after the school.

897
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:54,458
-Four
-Please, sir.

898
01:06:55,102 --> 01:06:56,426
Five...

899
01:06:56,992 --> 01:06:58,131
-What happened, sir?
-Nothing.

900
01:07:00,344 --> 01:07:02,013
-Let's go to his tuition center
-Okay, Arun.

901
01:07:12,885 --> 01:07:13,820
<i>Seven</i>

902
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:19,106
Please sir!

903
01:07:19,652 --> 01:07:21,222
Please don't do this, sir!

904
01:07:48,432 --> 01:07:50,034
Sir, I didn't do any mistake.

905
01:07:52,704 --> 01:07:53,538
Sir, I didn't do any mistake.

906
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:39,531
Tell me!

907
01:08:41,005 --> 01:08:42,429
What do you want me to speak?

908
01:08:44,589 --> 01:08:45,529
Why the hell did you do this?

909
01:08:48,948 --> 01:08:51,306
Have you ever felt the
depth of loneliness?

910
01:08:51,633 --> 01:08:55,380
I've waited all my life for someone to
give you a cup of coffee upon waking up.

911
01:08:55,683 --> 01:09:00,971
Similarly, there is no one who
would ask me if had eaten anything.

912
01:09:01,607 --> 01:09:06,710
Doing a job that I don't like without
any further growth in the life,

913
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:09,932
Do you know the agony in it?

914
01:09:11,445 --> 01:09:15,521
There should be some excitement in life.

915
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:16,666
Ow!

916
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:21,755
Excitement? How can you
murder girls for excitement?

917
01:09:23,728 --> 01:09:24,940
I haven't murdered anyone.

918
01:09:25,089 --> 01:09:28,224
Sobraj, We know that you took Meera to
your house the other day evening.

919
01:09:28,307 --> 01:09:29,974
Meera is my tuition student.

920
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:35,250
On that day, she go in to my
auto-Rickshaw, as planned.

921
01:09:36,162 --> 01:09:38,242
Is it already engaged?

922
01:09:39,103 --> 01:09:41,625
-Sir, this is Meera. Get in, sir.
<i>-I got into it as if it is coincidental.</i>

923
01:09:41,685 --> 01:09:42,895
-Are you sure?
-Sure, sir.

924
01:09:43,424 --> 01:09:45,838
<i>-Then I convinced her to come to my house</i>.
-Did you do this?

925
01:09:46,038 --> 01:09:48,179
Sir, this was made by
my ma'am. Isn't it good?

926
01:09:48,623 --> 01:09:50,232
Even my wife does
good embroidery.

927
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,196
She has made a lot of design
and hung all over the house.

928
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:53,607
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

929
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:55,333
Come home and you'll be surprised.

930
01:10:00,827 --> 01:10:02,110
Come inside, Meera.

931
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:14,514
-Sit, I'll bring something to drink.
-Okay, sir.

932
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:55,131
Oh!

933
01:10:56,372 --> 01:10:59,040
Meera, it is just a vitamin
tablet. Nothing wrong.

934
01:11:01,317 --> 01:11:03,005
Meera stop

935
01:11:03,205 --> 01:11:04,675
Hey, Meera! Meera... Stop...

936
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,360
Hey! Meera!

937
01:11:15,748 --> 01:11:16,748
Stop!

938
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:20,559
<i>When I came out and
looked for Meera...</i>

939
01:11:20,814 --> 01:11:22,213
<i>She wasn't there.</i>

940
01:11:27,776 --> 01:11:31,401
<i>Then, I saw a gift box on my gate.</i>

941
01:11:32,442 --> 01:11:37,502
After hearing the news that she was
missing, I resumed my job at school.

942
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:40,181
-I didn't do anything else.
-Don't you lie, Sobraj!

943
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:41,274
Don't you act innocent!

944
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:42,970
You killed all the four girls.

945
01:11:45,522 --> 01:11:47,558
You might be thinking to escape from
this case by trying to act like this.

946
01:11:47,853 --> 01:11:49,250
We have no plans to keep you alive!

947
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:52,703
If you tell the truth, you can at
least stay alive in jail till your death.

948
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:02,351
Sorry, gentleman.

949
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:07,345
Are you trying to frame me into the cases
which you are incapable of solving them

950
01:12:08,043 --> 01:12:09,533
and escape from it?

951
01:12:09,703 --> 01:12:10,626
Escape?

952
01:12:11,587 --> 01:12:12,634
Do you think so?

953
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:18,673
Hey... Sobraj... Hey... Get up! Get up!

954
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:20,624
<i>-Hey, Sobraj.
-What's all this, sir?</i>

955
01:12:20,824 --> 01:12:24,126
<i>Didn't I tell you not to
trouble the patient? Go out.</i>

956
01:12:24,565 --> 01:12:25,237
<i>Please leave!</i>

957
01:12:26,337 --> 01:12:29,506
This wretched person took advantage of his
teacher's profession to approach girls.

958
01:12:29,961 --> 01:12:32,680
As me and my team rounded
him up at the correct time,

959
01:12:32,999 --> 01:12:34,655
we could arrest him, sir.

960
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:36,462
Sir, since all the
evidences are against him,

961
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:38,394
he is trying to narrate
some story and escape.

962
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,909
He knows very well that he'll be
hanged to death if proved guilty,

963
01:12:40,937 --> 01:12:42,145
he is lying for sure.

964
01:12:42,185 --> 01:12:45,178
<i>He'll open his mouth if we give
him a third degree treatment.</i>

965
01:12:49,954 --> 01:12:50,938
Good job, Lakshmi.

966
01:12:51,425 --> 01:12:53,649
I was worried that you
guys were gonna miss him.

967
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:55,249
-Congrats to your team.
-Thank you, sir.

968
01:13:00,257 --> 01:13:01,418
Brother-in-law, why are you
placing the doll in the car trunk?

969
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,710
Oh! This one?

970
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:05,307
When Siri cuts her
birthday gift in the evening,

971
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:07,943
I'll hand it over to her as my
surprise gift. Don't tell her.

972
01:13:08,043 --> 01:13:08,586
Okay.

973
01:13:11,022 --> 01:13:11,839
Happy birthday

974
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:13,167
-Is it Ipad?
-Yes.

975
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:14,331
-Happy birthday Siri...
-Thank you, Uncle.

976
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,020
-Happy?
-Very happy.

977
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:19,754
Happy birthday...
One selfie, please...

978
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,121
Come closer, dear.

979
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:24,265
Why are looking dull?

980
01:13:24,481 --> 01:13:27,020
Forget about the case.
Come on, enjoy.

981
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:28,444
Come on, everyone!

982
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:42,615
Hey, this girl is looking good.

983
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:44,924
She looks very tall.
She would be your perfect match.

984
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:56,731
-Yes, she is looking good. Very good!

985
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:57,918
Very well...

986
01:13:58,423 --> 01:14:01,623
I can understand the type
of girl you're looking for.

987
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:06,660
Hello

988
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:15,557
-Greetings, sir.
-Second floor, sir.

989
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:23,192
Sobraj, the police have
surrounded the hospital.

990
01:14:24,218 --> 01:14:25,311
You can't escape from here.

991
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,540
Listen to me... drop your gun.

992
01:14:29,014 --> 01:14:29,931
Don't come near.

993
01:14:30,183 --> 01:14:33,810
Else, I will shoot him. No!

994
01:14:34,862 --> 01:14:36,930
Sobraj, you are doing
mistakes over and again.

995
01:14:37,558 --> 01:14:38,485
-Let go of him
-No!

996
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:41,720
You guys are trying to
frame and finish me off.

997
01:14:42,218 --> 01:14:43,050
I have to go!

998
01:14:43,126 --> 01:14:45,248
No matter what you say, all
the evidences are against you.

999
01:14:45,478 --> 01:14:48,143
Drop the gun and surrender
yourself. We won't harm you.

1000
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:51,920
No matter what I do, you guys will
finish me eventually in an encounter.

1001
01:14:51,939 --> 01:14:55,224
You can't escape, Sobraj.
Drop the gun.

1002
01:14:55,332 --> 01:14:56,003
No, I can't!

1003
01:14:56,683 --> 01:14:59,989
All of you drop your
gun and step back. Now!

1004
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:01,932
Ma'am, he is holding the gun wrong.

1005
01:15:02,968 --> 01:15:04,218
He also appears restless.

1006
01:15:04,461 --> 01:15:05,845
For now, let's obey him

1007
01:15:06,188 --> 01:15:08,028
We can nab him before
he leaves this hospital

1008
01:15:08,457 --> 01:15:09,404
Will you shut up?

1009
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:16,703
Ma'am, he's holding a very sensitive
gun. It'll get fired easily.

1010
01:15:17,365 --> 01:15:20,405
I know all that. Get out, first!

1011
01:15:20,605 --> 01:15:21,092
Huh!

1012
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:25,848
Ma'am...

1013
01:15:27,404 --> 01:15:28,997
We must save Venkat somehow.

1014
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,584
-Please listen to me.
-I said, get out!

1015
01:15:33,052 --> 01:15:36,446
Sobraj.
Hand over the gun and surrender yourself.

1016
01:15:36,646 --> 01:15:37,969
It's for your good.

1017
01:15:38,313 --> 01:15:39,477
Listne to me.

1018
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:40,463
No!

1019
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,422
I'll count up to three and by then I want
everyone to drop your gun and step back!

1020
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:46,995
Or else I'll shoot him for sure.

1021
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:51,676
One.

1022
01:15:55,215 --> 01:15:56,236
Two.

1023
01:15:56,683 --> 01:15:58,012
Put your guns down!

1024
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:02,298
Three!

1025
01:17:02,216 --> 01:17:05,840
No matter what I do, you guys will
finish me eventually in an encounter.

1026
01:17:23,743 --> 01:17:24,674
Arun!

1027
01:17:24,892 --> 01:17:25,948
What happened, brother-in-law?

1028
01:17:27,266 --> 01:17:29,105
Siri's been missing
since a very long time.

1029
01:17:29,117 --> 01:17:31,228
-I am really worried!
-Don't worry, brother-in-law.

1030
01:17:31,758 --> 01:17:32,325
Nothing would've happened to her.

1031
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,785
Your sister told that she
went out with a friend.

1032
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:36,185
Your sister is really worried!

1033
01:17:36,506 --> 01:17:37,581
Please console her.

1034
01:18:23,052 --> 01:18:23,659
Prasad

1035
01:18:24,409 --> 01:18:25,713
We have arranged special teams.

1036
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:27,148
They are on the job

1037
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,769
We'll find Siri within morning.

1038
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:31,906
Don't worry.

1039
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:34,440
Siri will be alright. Don't worry.

1040
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:47,139
Arun...

1041
01:18:47,225 --> 01:18:48,948
Where is the child who was shooting
the party with his handy cam?

1042
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:54,329
<i>Hey, come out of that case.</i>

1043
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,318
<i>-Smile!
-Hello Rahul.</i>

1044
01:18:56,518 --> 01:18:57,291
Hello uncle!

1045
01:18:57,503 --> 01:18:59,432
<i>-Where is Siri?
-She is outside, uncle.</i>

1046
01:18:59,613 --> 01:19:02,782
<i>Rahul, don't just shoot us,
but cover everyone in the party.</i>

1047
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,419
<i>-Okay.
-That's the way... with those balloons...</i>

1048
01:19:05,571 --> 01:19:08,744
<i>-That's it..
-</i>

1049
01:19:09,491 --> 01:19:10,239
<i>Pom Pom...</i>

1050
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13,278
<i>Siri, it's time to cut the cake. Come on.</i>

1051
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,646
<i>Coming... Give me 2 minutes...</i>

1052
01:19:19,605 --> 01:19:22,103
<i>Siri, it's time to cut the cake. Come on.</i>

1053
01:19:22,108 --> 01:19:22,525
<i>2...</i>

1054
01:19:24,242 --> 01:19:26,774
Hey... did you see whom Siri was talking
to when you were recording this video?

1055
01:19:26,906 --> 01:19:27,710
I don' know, uncle.

1056
01:19:27,914 --> 01:19:29,686
Don't be afraid.
Think well and answer.

1057
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,896
She went out with a guy who was
wearing a blue colored shirt.

1058
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:35,681
Sir, I didn't take Siri anywhere.

1059
01:19:35,857 --> 01:19:38,300
Hey,
I saw you taking her out in the video.

1060
01:19:39,646 --> 01:19:41,710
She went missing after she
talked to you at the gate.

1061
01:19:41,802 --> 01:19:43,753
-Tell me the truth!
-I don't have to lie sir.

1062
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:44,491
Hey!

1063
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:46,985
I won't even bother that you're a kid.
I'll bash you up inside the prison

1064
01:19:47,185 --> 01:19:48,189
Tell me the truth!

1065
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:51,451
Sir...

1066
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,666
I thought she wouldn't reject me
if I propose her on her birthday,

1067
01:19:53,882 --> 01:19:54,970
So I called her out.

1068
01:19:55,107 --> 01:19:57,591
By the time I tried to propose her,
a van came on the opposite side

1069
01:19:57,797 --> 01:19:59,255
-A van?
-Yes, sir.

1070
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:02,230
I thought it was some of Siri's
relatives and I left from that place.

1071
01:20:02,296 --> 01:20:03,576
Did you see anyone inside the van?

1072
01:20:04,235 --> 01:20:05,427
No, sir. I didn't see anyone.

1073
01:20:06,356 --> 01:20:07,364
What kind of van was it?

1074
01:20:08,299 --> 01:20:09,820
I couldn't notice it
properly in the dark, sir.

1075
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:14,457
Get the list of vehicles that
came to the birthday party.

1076
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:16,473
I am pretty sure there would
be psychopath's van among them.

1077
01:20:16,723 --> 01:20:17,962
Okay, Arun.

1078
01:20:25,804 --> 01:20:26,388
Uncle!

1079
01:20:27,499 --> 01:20:29,798
-Did you check that car?
-That is our ACP's car, Arun.

1080
01:20:41,953 --> 01:20:43,401
<i>A van came on the opposite side.</i>

1081
01:20:43,732 --> 01:20:45,806
<i>-A van?
-Yes, sir.</i>

1082
01:20:47,448 --> 01:20:50,292
<i>I thought it was some of Siri's
relatives and I left from that place.</i>

1083
01:20:50,557 --> 01:20:51,796
<i>Did you see anyone inside the van?</i>

1084
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:52,589
<i>No, sir.</i>

1085
01:20:52,683 --> 01:20:53,479
<i>What kind of van was it?</i>

1086
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,117
<i>I couldn't notice it
properly in the dark, sir.</i>

1087
01:21:05,772 --> 01:21:07,231
-Arun
-Yes.

1088
01:21:09,711 --> 01:21:12,660
-We will find Siri, right?
-Brother-in-law, please!

1089
01:21:12,938 --> 01:21:14,813
I will put my life on
the line to save Siri.

1090
01:21:16,795 --> 01:21:18,592
It's been two days since she is missing.

1091
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:22,724
Well, she is the daughter of a cop.

1092
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,509
She will give tough time to the kidnapper.

1093
01:21:27,519 --> 01:21:32,446
Remember how she put you in soup at
the school by making you forge my sign?

1094
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:36,281
Her eyes are really big and round.

1095
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:42,175
She'll somehow scare the kidnapper
with her eyes and manage to escape.

1096
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:44,750
You too will see that.

1097
01:21:46,759 --> 01:21:47,661
She will escape.

1098
01:21:51,176 --> 01:21:53,075
All I need is finding Siri.

1099
01:21:57,461 --> 01:22:01,093
It's been two days. We don't
know if she had eaten any food.

1100
01:22:04,826 --> 01:22:05,785
That's okay...

1101
01:22:05,985 --> 01:22:07,183
Siri...

1102
01:22:08,813 --> 01:22:09,806
We'll get her back.

1103
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:29,053
-What is it?
-Nothing, brother-in-law.

1104
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:35,010
Is that Siri?

1105
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:46,506
Don't go, brother-in-law.
There is nothing in there.

1106
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,272
-Listen to me...
-Hey...

1107
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,331
-Don't go, brother-in-law!
-Hey...

1108
01:22:50,702 --> 01:22:52,209
-Wait, brother-in-law. Please...
-Hey...

1109
01:22:52,674 --> 01:22:54,305
-Listen to me...
-Hey... Arun...

1110
01:22:54,378 --> 01:22:58,836
Don't go, brother-in-law! Listen to me...

1111
01:22:59,728 --> 01:23:02,266
Wait, brother-in-law.
Don't go... Please listen to me.

1112
01:23:02,408 --> 01:23:03,000
Hey!

1113
01:23:12,312 --> 01:23:16,333
Hey... I'm a cop too.

1114
01:23:19,711 --> 01:23:20,781
Let me see

1115
01:23:27,116 --> 01:23:29,304
-Hey...
-Please, brother-in-law. Don't go.

1116
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,500
Siri... Siri...

1117
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:30,556
<i>Hey Arun!</i>

1118
01:24:38,594 --> 01:24:39,462
Arun!

1119
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:43,955
What happened?

1120
01:24:44,597 --> 01:24:46,044
-What happened, dear?
-Ah! It's nothing

1121
01:24:46,799 --> 01:24:48,132
I bought this teddy bear for Siri.

1122
01:24:48,315 --> 01:24:49,871
I forgot it in the car trunk.

1123
01:24:50,409 --> 01:24:52,563
My fingers got hurt
when I was taking it out.

1124
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:53,683
Well, here take it.

1125
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:03,352
Hey, take the vehicle and leave.

1126
01:25:03,483 --> 01:25:05,687
Didn't you say that you
got a clue about Siri? Go.

1127
01:25:11,132 --> 01:25:12,095
Go now.

1128
01:25:41,407 --> 01:25:43,749
You should have given me the
teddy bear at that time, dad.

1129
01:25:43,784 --> 01:25:47,660
I forgot about it as I was
busy managing the station.

1130
01:25:48,136 --> 01:25:50,733
You always do like this,
dad. Won't you give me?

1131
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:51,969
Ah...

1132
01:26:00,569 --> 01:26:06,569
"My sweet baby, look at me...
oh my darling, look at me"

1133
01:26:07,186 --> 01:26:13,139
"Oh my dear girl, open your eyes once"

1134
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:20,085
"Please speak to me once my munchkin"

1135
01:26:20,656 --> 01:26:26,656
"Speak sweetly as you always did"

1136
01:26:27,759 --> 01:26:31,048
"At such a tender age"

1137
01:26:31,536 --> 01:26:35,843
-"You're on a journey leaving everyone"
-Siri.. the brakes!

1138
01:26:36,043 --> 01:26:38,773
Don't confuse her brother-in-law...
How can she learn if you confuse her?

1139
01:26:38,973 --> 01:26:42,227
<i>-How can she learn if I don't tell her?
-She knows everything, I've taught her</i>

1140
01:26:42,881 --> 01:26:44,400
You don't panic her. Stay quiet.

1141
01:26:44,906 --> 01:26:45,981
-Hit the brakes!
-Hey!

1142
01:27:21,387 --> 01:27:24,498
"The dancing legs stopped now"

1143
01:27:24,673 --> 01:27:27,601
"The embracing arms are tired now"

1144
01:27:28,036 --> 01:27:33,704
"The god has called you to him"

1145
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:37,966
"The blue eyes would be turned to ashes"

1146
01:27:38,304 --> 01:27:41,367
"The beautiful cheeks
would be set on fire"

1147
01:27:41,924 --> 01:27:47,504
"Your mother has an incredible loss!"

1148
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:52,101
"Your toys are heartbroken"

1149
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:55,299
"Your friends look for you"

1150
01:27:55,608 --> 01:28:01,374
"Tears flow like a river looking at you"

1151
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,537
He tortured and killed our Siri.

1152
01:28:13,737 --> 01:28:17,552
The thought that he would
feel happy for our grief

1153
01:28:18,753 --> 01:28:20,356
is boiling my blood.

1154
01:28:21,928 --> 01:28:25,191
We couldn't do anything
despite being policemen.

1155
01:28:31,434 --> 01:28:33,773
What do I do with this report, sir?

1156
01:28:35,738 --> 01:28:39,220
Should I remember how
he tortured my daughter?

1157
01:28:42,788 --> 01:28:48,397
Why should I keep this report
when my daughter is not alive?

1158
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,193
Arun...

1159
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:02,631
I don't know how many more days
should I hide this truth from your sister.

1160
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:04,784
We are leaving.

1161
01:29:07,691 --> 01:29:08,777
You take care

1162
01:29:12,592 --> 01:29:14,569
It was a very critical situation
at the hospital to save Venkat,

1163
01:29:14,738 --> 01:29:16,245
and that is why we has use the gun

1164
01:29:16,445 --> 01:29:18,984
Mr Arun fired his gun
at the girl's school.

1165
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,113
What was that? Heroism?

1166
01:29:21,409 --> 01:29:22,670
No FIR was filed against him.

1167
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:24,692
As per rules, no enquiry
was conducted on him.

1168
01:29:24,887 --> 01:29:26,699
Then, how did you guys
conclude that he is the accused?

1169
01:29:27,087 --> 01:29:28,337
Do you think the police
cannot be questioned?

1170
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:31,216
Mr Arun must appear in front of this
committee within the next two days.

1171
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,341
Otherwise, we will have to suspend you.

1172
01:29:33,628 --> 01:29:35,490
You got a summon asking you
to appear before the committee.

1173
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:37,784
I suspend you for three months officially.

1174
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:40,127
Sorry Arun, I don't have a choice.

1175
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:42,260
You stay away from this case

1176
01:29:49,054 --> 01:29:50,030
Arun!

1177
01:29:50,544 --> 01:29:51,730
Arun!

1178
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:59,544
Arun... Please Arun!

1179
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:15,783
Apart form being students, there is some
other link between these four victims.

1180
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:18,978
Unable to crack that...

1181
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,199
I have failed, Krishna.

1182
01:30:23,655 --> 01:30:26,341
I couldn't even save a
single soul around me.

1183
01:30:26,915 --> 01:30:28,874
Not even a single soul!

1184
01:30:30,187 --> 01:30:31,724
What's the use of being a cop?

1185
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:35,588
One clue... Just one clue...

1186
01:30:38,305 --> 01:30:39,454
I am scared, Krishna.

1187
01:30:41,573 --> 01:30:42,790
Please stand by me.

1188
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:44,625
I will be with you all the time.

1189
01:30:44,825 --> 01:30:47,085
Please don't lose your courage.

1190
01:30:49,536 --> 01:30:51,498
<i>Unable to crack that...</i>

1191
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:53,859
<i>I have failed, Krishna.</i>

1192
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,994
<i>I couldn't even save a
single soul around me.</i>

1193
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:00,870
-<i>Not even a single soul!</i>
-Hey!

1194
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:02,203
Why did you record all this?

1195
01:31:06,245 --> 01:31:07,463
I'm so sorry, Arun.

1196
01:31:08,131 --> 01:31:09,340
When someone speaks,

1197
01:31:09,748 --> 01:31:13,117
she records it in this and hear it
repeatedly for her speech training.

1198
01:31:14,106 --> 01:31:16,109
My student Meera used
this same kind of device.

1199
01:31:16,397 --> 01:31:17,877
So, I bought it for Kavya
after seeing that one

1200
01:31:18,874 --> 01:31:21,937
So... Does Meera's hearing aid
has the same recording facility?

1201
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:23,560
Yes

1202
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:47,410
<i>Happy anniversary.
Wish you a happy married life</i>

1203
01:32:00,517 --> 01:32:01,813
This is indeed Meera's voice.

1204
01:32:57,982 --> 01:33:00,719
I don't think this music
has released in our place.

1205
01:33:00,847 --> 01:33:03,343
Infact, there is no language for music.

1206
01:33:03,398 --> 01:33:05,694
Moreover,
this style is a Mexican and Indian mix.

1207
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:11,710
In that way, I feel this could
be an Anglo-Indian style of music.

1208
01:33:11,856 --> 01:33:13,232
Based on the playing style,

1209
01:33:13,497 --> 01:33:16,480
<i>the psycho you are looking for...
may be he could be a pianist.</i>

1210
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:21,271
A program like that can be arranged but

1211
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,295
9 to 10 timings is the peak hour slot.

1212
01:33:24,336 --> 01:33:26,785
So, we need to get the
permission from head office.

1213
01:33:26,918 --> 01:33:28,443
Sir, I am under suspension

1214
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:29,257
That's why I'm insisting for the letter.

1215
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:31,971
Without the letter, I'll have to
give explanation for my head office.

1216
01:33:34,853 --> 01:33:37,023
Hello Arun, are you aware of
the situation and asking for it?

1217
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:40,391
A memo was given to Lakshmi ma'am as
you didn't appear before the committee.

1218
01:33:40,526 --> 01:33:42,207
She is already furious with you.

1219
01:33:42,298 --> 01:33:44,794
They have warned her and asked her to
produce you before them in two days.

1220
01:33:44,795 --> 01:33:47,455
And you ask for a letter from her.
That's an impossible thing.

1221
01:33:47,551 --> 01:33:48,152
Forget it.

1222
01:33:48,451 --> 01:33:49,796
<i>Greetings Hyderabad!</i>

1223
01:33:49,842 --> 01:33:54,859
<i>This is Hyderabad's favourite
radio station 91.1 Radiocity</i>

1224
01:33:54,991 --> 01:33:56,310

<i>Awesome songs await you tonight.</i>

1226
01:33:58,988 --> 01:34:03,392
<i>All you gotta do is listen to the track
we play, by the way it's a rare track.</i>

1227
01:34:03,554 --> 01:34:06,368
<i>Tell us the composer or when
and where have you heard it</i>

1228
01:34:06,679 --> 01:34:10,281
<i>and gives us details
like it's note and beats.</i>

1229
01:34:10,428 --> 01:34:12,607
We have the first caller on line.
Let's talk to him

1230
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:14,366
Hello and Greetings!

1231
01:34:14,475 --> 01:34:15,974
<i>Hello, I'm Shiva from SR nagar.</i>

1232
01:34:16,182 --> 01:34:18,579
Hey Shiva. Tell us, what do
you know about this track?

1233
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:20,681
<i>Come on madam,
how can we say by playing just music?</i>

1234
01:34:20,705 --> 01:34:21,738
<i>Give us some clue</i>

1235
01:34:22,317 --> 01:34:25,245
I have no clues, Shiva.
Enjoy the song.

1236
01:34:25,684 --> 01:34:27,666
Our next caller is on the line. Hello.

1237
01:34:28,899 --> 01:34:31,976
<i>The music sounded really great
but I don't know its details.</i>

1238
01:34:32,866 --> 01:34:34,063
<i>This is Pachabottesi song
from Bahubali, isn't it?</i>

1239
01:34:34,123 --> 01:34:36,128
-I think it's Keeravani's composition.
-Another caller online. Hello!

1240
01:34:36,215 --> 01:34:37,782
-Hey, this is a love beat.

1241
01:34:37,953 --> 01:34:39,786
It is the song from the
movie Tholiprema, isn't it?

1242
01:34:39,886 --> 01:34:40,813
-This is Illayaraja's song.
-Your favourite song for you!

1243
01:34:41,337 --> 01:34:42,427
-This is Allu Arjun's song.
-Let's talk to one more sweetheart!

1244
01:34:42,627 --> 01:34:44,055
<i>This is the song from the
movie Neerajanam, isn't it?</i>

1245
01:34:44,255 --> 01:34:44,737
Do you know?

1246
01:34:44,937 --> 01:34:45,895
<i>This is Raj Koti's song from
the movie Hello Brother.</i>

1247
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:46,488
<i>It is Honey Singh's song.</i>

1248
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:48,449
-I heard it somewhere, but I can't recall.
-The next song is for you!

1249
01:34:49,169 --> 01:34:49,809
Hey, this is Sonu Nigam's song.

1250
01:34:50,009 --> 01:34:52,827
The last song for today is coming up.

1251
01:34:56,347 --> 01:34:59,722
Thanks a lot to everyone who has been
enjoying listening to the lovely songs!

1252
01:34:59,922 --> 01:35:01,774
I'm your Sunitha... singing off!

1253
01:35:04,007 --> 01:35:05,450
Sir, it was supposed to be
a half an hour programme.

1254
01:35:06,165 --> 01:35:07,723
But we have extended it to an
hour as you have requested.

1255
01:35:07,864 --> 01:35:11,497
Next, we have a celebrity interview.
He's already waiting outside.

1256
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,480
Sir! Sir!

1257
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,359
A girl is on the line saying
she knows about that music sir!

1258
01:35:38,521 --> 01:35:40,462
Go ahead Swetha, tell us what details
have you got about that music?

1259
01:35:40,638 --> 01:35:42,266
I have heard it at our
school's annual day function.

1260
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:44,317
What?
At your school's annual day function?

1261
01:35:44,517 --> 01:35:45,332
Yes.

1262
01:35:48,308 --> 01:35:50,424
Swetha, when did the annual
day function take place?

1263
01:35:50,951 --> 01:35:51,786
Yes sir!

1264
01:35:51,986 --> 01:35:54,112
The annual day function
took place three months ago.

1265
01:35:54,488 --> 01:35:55,960
Do you have the video
of that function, sir?

1266
01:37:07,743 --> 01:37:09,913
Sir, do you have this lady's
details or contact number?

1267
01:37:09,931 --> 01:37:11,606
Actually, this lady is speech impaired

1268
01:37:11,878 --> 01:37:14,692
She voluntarily came to us and requested
that she would perform the magic show.

1269
01:37:14,943 --> 01:37:17,224
So, we didn't collect any
contact details from her.

1270
01:37:20,913 --> 01:37:21,571
Hello Arun

1271
01:37:21,795 --> 01:37:23,086
Hello Krishna, are you at the school?

1272
01:37:23,286 --> 01:37:23,709
Yes

1273
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:26,259
Did any magic show happen at your school
a few days before Meera went missing?

1274
01:37:26,459 --> 01:37:27,072
Yes it did...

1275
01:37:27,276 --> 01:37:28,510
Was it an old lady who performed it?

1276
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:29,333
Yes...

1277
01:37:29,533 --> 01:37:30,703
Go watch the video of
that magic show immediately.

1278
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:31,555
-Tell me Arun.
-<i>Hello Venkat.</i>

1279
01:37:31,574 --> 01:37:32,667
-Go to Amrutha's school immediately.
-Okay Arun

1280
01:37:33,046 --> 01:37:34,547
A magic show took place few days ago.

1281
01:37:34,593 --> 01:37:36,026
-Go, check it's video footage immediately.
-Okay

1282
01:37:47,067 --> 01:37:49,494
A little forward please.
Forward... Forward...

1283
01:37:51,394 --> 01:37:52,532
Pause... Pause...

1284
01:38:01,769 --> 01:38:03,533
Samyuktha was the
first victim in this case.

1285
01:38:03,772 --> 01:38:05,324
Samyuktha was
kidnapped on October 20th.

1286
01:38:05,532 --> 01:38:07,508
The annual day function at her
school took place on Oct 18th

1287
01:38:08,141 --> 01:38:09,396
Second victim... Amrutha.

1288
01:38:09,537 --> 01:38:10,743
-Date of kidnap.
-November 16th.

1289
01:38:11,687 --> 01:38:14,599
On 14th Nov there was children's
day celebration at her school.

1290
01:38:15,256 --> 01:38:16,367
Third victim... Meera.

1291
01:38:16,516 --> 01:38:17,359
Kidnapped on Dec 20th.

1292
01:38:17,775 --> 01:38:19,278
Their annual day function
took place on Dec 18th.

1293
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,570
Fourth victim... Siri.

1294
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:24,935
Date of kidnap... 4th January..

1295
01:38:25,063 --> 01:38:26,783
Education day... 2nd January.

1296
01:38:26,972 --> 01:38:29,950
Two days prior to kidnap of these 4 girls,
an event took place in all their schools.

1297
01:38:30,082 --> 01:38:32,550
The common event all those
events is the Magic show.

1298
01:38:33,584 --> 01:38:35,640
That lady used her Magic
show as a tool to kidnap the girls.

1299
01:38:35,656 --> 01:38:36,148
How?

1300
01:38:36,453 --> 01:38:38,565
First, she impresses all the
children with her magic show.

1301
01:38:38,665 --> 01:38:39,557
Later...

1302
01:38:41,767 --> 01:38:45,351
Second, she selects a girl as a
volunteer and invite her on the stage.

1303
01:38:48,591 --> 01:38:52,072
Third, she interacts with the
volunteers and gets closer to them.

1304
01:38:52,488 --> 01:38:55,003
Fourth, she starts to stalk
the selected student.

1305
01:38:55,591 --> 01:38:59,953
Finally, she kidnaps the student exactly
after the 2nd day of show without any fuss

1306
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:01,337
This is her pattern of crime.

1307
01:39:01,937 --> 01:39:03,086
We must immediately
find out if this lady had...

1308
01:39:03,162 --> 01:39:05,526
...committed any magic shows
in any of the schools.

1309
01:39:05,705 --> 01:39:07,327
But we must enquire it
in a secretive manner

1310
01:39:07,335 --> 01:39:09,023
We will collect those
details within an hour.

1311
01:39:24,519 --> 01:39:25,068
Arun,

1312
01:39:25,224 --> 01:39:27,942
a magic show took place on 17th of this
month at Mother Teresa school function.

1313
01:39:28,142 --> 01:39:29,701
As you said,
it's the same lady who gave the show.

1314
01:39:31,624 --> 01:39:32,440
Today is the 19th, isn't it?

1315
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:33,603
So it's the second day...

1316
01:39:31,703 --> 01:39:33,315
Today is 19th... the second day

1317
01:39:50,692 --> 01:39:52,773
The time's up. Ring the last bell

1318
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:25,659
Hello!

1319
01:40:29,003 --> 01:40:30,076
Sundaram!

1320
01:40:30,543 --> 01:40:31,961
Wait for 10 minutes!

1321
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:39,662
Venkat ask them to lock the gate.

1322
01:40:42,825 --> 01:40:44,207
-Madam where is the principal room?
-That last room.

1323
01:40:46,183 --> 01:40:47,854
Ma'am, it's me who called you earlier.

1324
01:40:50,516 --> 01:40:51,463
Pause madam!

1325
01:40:52,363 --> 01:40:53,465
Who is this girl and from which class?

1326
01:40:53,665 --> 01:40:56,286
Her name is Sanjana, 10th class,
section 'A', school topper.

1327
01:40:56,386 --> 01:40:57,534
-Where is her class room?
-1st floor.

1328
01:41:04,181 --> 01:41:05,163
-Wait here.
-Ok Arun!

1329
01:41:06,331 --> 01:41:07,569
Ma'am, I'm Arun from Police department.

1330
01:41:10,547 --> 01:41:12,890
Please tell me what's
the matter? Any problem?

1331
01:41:17,112 --> 01:41:18,712
An awareness meet
regarding students safety.

1332
01:41:18,912 --> 01:41:19,969
Ok go ahead sir.

1333
01:41:21,171 --> 01:41:24,233
Girls, a small advice.
Please listen to me carefully.

1334
01:41:24,533 --> 01:41:26,687
Everyone around us need not
necessarily be good people.

1335
01:41:26,887 --> 01:41:29,025
A problem may arise anytime and anywhere.

1336
01:41:29,225 --> 01:41:31,220
Whether it be our
house or any public place.

1337
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:32,952
Though we cannot avoid the problem,

1338
01:41:33,152 --> 01:41:35,997
we can face it by following the
5 guidelines I tell you now.

1339
01:41:36,273 --> 01:41:39,384
First point, do not get scared.
Fear is the biggest enemy.

1340
01:41:39,584 --> 01:41:41,370
It will weaken you both
mentally and physically.

1341
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:45,137
Second point, face the situation. You
should appear like fearless to the enemy.

1342
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:48,505
Third point, think about how you
can come out of that situation.

1343
01:41:48,705 --> 01:41:51,586
Fourth point,
try to inform about it to someone.

1344
01:41:51,786 --> 01:41:53,883
Fifth point,
if any of these are not possible,

1345
01:41:54,083 --> 01:41:56,760
Attack on the enemy
using all your strength.

1346
01:41:58,010 --> 01:41:59,199
Do you know something?

1347
01:41:59,539 --> 01:42:02,748
Every pain is lesser before the
pain you endure while giving birth

1348
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:05,114
Do not underestimate your strength.

1349
01:42:05,314 --> 01:42:07,448
So be confident and be brave.

1350
01:42:07,648 --> 01:42:10,441
And lastly I would like to remind,
Police are here for your protection.

1351
01:42:10,862 --> 01:42:12,993
-Do you all have your cell phones?
-Hmm?

1352
01:42:14,463 --> 01:42:18,860
Ah... Ma'am, I forgot to mention,
Principal ma'am has called you.

1353
01:42:19,442 --> 01:42:20,443
Okay

1354
01:42:22,146 --> 01:42:24,049
Now you tell me, do you
all have your cell phones?

1355
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:34,644
Girls, this is my personal
number. All of you save it.

1356
01:42:41,464 --> 01:42:43,582
-Did you save my number dear?
-I did sir.

1357
01:42:44,282 --> 01:42:45,557
Let me see.

1358
01:42:52,909 --> 01:42:53,843
Hmm!

1359
01:42:55,116 --> 01:42:56,919
Ok girls, thanks for your time.

1360
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:06,996
Okay Arun

1361
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:10,428
She is stepping out of the school

1362
01:43:26,782 --> 01:43:27,949
Bye!

1363
01:43:32,028 --> 01:43:34,617
Auto-rickshaw number 6267.
Venkat, follow it.

1364
01:43:47,519 --> 01:43:49,380
Careful! We shouldn't miss her

1365
01:43:50,795 --> 01:43:52,391
Go! Don't stop!

1366
01:43:53,203 --> 01:43:54,506
Why did you stop? I told you not to!

1367
01:43:55,943 --> 01:43:57,421
Venkat,
we missed the vehicle at the signal

1368
01:43:57,621 --> 01:43:58,938
Auto-rickshaw turned to the left.
Follow it

1369
01:43:59,138 --> 01:44:00,048
<i>Okay Arun</i>

1370
01:44:02,518 --> 01:44:03,256
Move it! Move it!

1371
01:44:08,837 --> 01:44:10,822
Hello Arun...
if you come further and take a right

1372
01:44:11,165 --> 01:44:13,770
there is Vivekananda Tution Centre.
She went inside

1373
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,065
We are right behind you

1374
01:44:15,265 --> 01:44:16,340
Hmm...

1375
01:44:37,423 --> 01:44:38,843
Arun... Sanjana...

1376
01:44:47,043 --> 01:44:49,177
Hello Venkat. That girl is going
with a guy on a bike. Follow them

1377
01:44:49,377 --> 01:44:50,417
<i>Okay Arun</i>

1378
01:44:58,415 --> 01:45:00,282
Careful! Maintain the distance

1379
01:45:09,161 --> 01:45:10,155
Careful Vijay!

1380
01:46:52,926 --> 01:46:54,385
Damn! We missed her!

1381
01:46:57,808 --> 01:46:58,898
You go to your left!

1382
01:46:59,387 --> 01:47:00,704
Venkat... both of you take the right!

1383
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,454
Who are you sir?

1384
01:47:18,654 --> 01:47:20,135
What did that lady in the van ask you?

1385
01:47:20,335 --> 01:47:21,545
She asked for an address.

1386
01:47:21,745 --> 01:47:22,702
How does she look?

1387
01:47:23,133 --> 01:47:24,130
Who are you?

1388
01:47:25,458 --> 01:47:27,550
It's me Arun!
I came to your class earlier.

1389
01:47:28,750 --> 01:47:32,738
Oh! Sorry sir, you should have
been to my sister, Sanjana's class.

1390
01:47:33,438 --> 01:47:35,848
My name is Sangeetha, we both are twins.

1391
01:47:36,048 --> 01:47:36,556
Huh?

1392
01:47:40,907 --> 01:47:43,163
-Then where is Sanjana?
-She's been to music class.

1393
01:47:43,363 --> 01:47:45,122
-Where is her music class?
-Kukatpally.

1394
01:47:45,322 --> 01:47:46,914
But why sir?

1395
01:47:53,611 --> 01:47:55,750
t's here Arun!

1396
01:48:00,352 --> 01:48:02,882
Hello, Salman go to the control room
immediately and trace Sanjana's number.

1397
01:48:27,339 --> 01:48:27,818
Hello!

1398
01:48:28,018 --> 01:48:31,064
Arun we traced the number. It is now
exactly crossing Secunderabad Flyover.

1399
01:48:34,488 --> 01:48:36,975
Good keep a close watch.
Go towards, Secunderabad Paradise.

1400
01:48:42,339 --> 01:48:44,834
Arun it is entering towards
Trimulgherry road from Patny.

1401
01:48:47,002 --> 01:48:49,995
Very good, we are almost
at the Patny center. Keep tracing.

1402
01:48:55,487 --> 01:48:58,486
Arun! It has the All Saints church
and moving towards Army Hospital.

1403
01:48:58,686 --> 01:49:00,871
We too are close by. Take left.

1404
01:49:03,526 --> 01:49:04,978
Sir he's going towards right.

1405
01:49:06,288 --> 01:49:08,515
Any further movement? Give me any update!

1406
01:49:12,227 --> 01:49:14,850
Arun we lost the tower signal,
while the number was in movement.

1407
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:16,793
Damn! Exactly in which
area is the signal was lost?

1408
01:49:16,993 --> 01:49:18,272
In Jawahar street, Balaji Nagar.

1409
01:49:43,731 --> 01:49:44,722
Ma'am!

1410
01:49:47,859 --> 01:49:49,213
Ma'am!

1411
01:49:50,653 --> 01:49:51,858
Where are we now Ma'am!

1412
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:56,625
They would be waiting for me at home.

1413
01:49:57,025 --> 01:49:58,844
I'll go.

1414
01:50:03,957 --> 01:50:06,058
There's no way that they
went away from Balaji Nagar.

1415
01:50:06,258 --> 01:50:08,626
If they did, we would've got the
signal connected to the next tower.

1416
01:50:08,826 --> 01:50:10,026
Right right!

1417
01:50:10,461 --> 01:50:11,511
Ma'am...

1418
01:50:12,991 --> 01:50:14,622
I've got to use the restroom

1419
01:51:58,530 --> 01:52:00,436
Venkat, I'll go to right,
you check on the left.

1420
01:52:00,654 --> 01:52:01,311
Ok Arun.

1421
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:35,347
Hello... hello Sanjana!

1422
01:52:35,547 --> 01:52:37,928
Hello Arun sir, it's me Sanjana speaking.

1423
01:52:38,128 --> 01:52:40,928
-Where are you Sanjana?
-That magician lady has kidnapped me.

1424
01:52:43,942 --> 01:52:46,286
I locked myself in the bathroom.

1425
01:52:46,444 --> 01:52:48,098
Don't worry
Sanjana, I'm very close by.

1426
01:52:50,252 --> 01:52:51,252
Arun... it's the control room

1427
01:52:51,452 --> 01:52:52,545
Sanjana give me a minute dear...

1428
01:52:53,032 --> 01:52:53,732
Tell me Salman

1429
01:52:53,904 --> 01:52:55,343
If you turn towards
North from your location,

1430
01:52:55,543 --> 01:52:57,670
Sanjana's phone is 200 metres
away from the Masjid there.

1431
01:52:59,902 --> 01:53:02,015
Arun, you're going in
the opposite direction.

1432
01:53:02,215 --> 01:53:03,853
Oh damn! Stop stop! Take U turn.

1433
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:06,595
I feel very scared sir.

1434
01:53:07,704 --> 01:53:08,559
Back... back...

1435
01:53:09,959 --> 01:53:12,277
-Sir... Sir!
-Hello! What happened Sanjana?

1436
01:53:13,125 --> 01:53:14,843
She's breaking the glass sir.

1437
01:53:15,043 --> 01:53:17,797
Oh no!
Remember what I told you in the class.

1438
01:53:18,562 --> 01:53:20,693
-Come soon sir!
-Don't be scared.

1439
01:53:20,893 --> 01:53:22,016
Be brave.

1440
01:53:22,216 --> 01:53:25,045
We could trace your location.
Is there a window in the bathroom?

1441
01:53:26,549 --> 01:53:28,139
Please tell me quickly!

1442
01:53:29,096 --> 01:53:30,475
Yes, there is sir.

1443
01:53:31,075 --> 01:53:33,510
Face the situation boldly.
If you find anything in the bathroom,

1444
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:36,097
break the window with it and
try to escape from there.

1445
01:53:36,297 --> 01:53:37,316
I'm coming.

1446
01:53:37,847 --> 01:53:39,388
Don't worry Sanjana. Be cool.

1447
01:53:39,588 --> 01:53:40,161
Ok sir!

1448
01:53:40,448 --> 01:53:43,781
Salman let me know the exact
location of Sanjana's phone.

1449
01:53:43,981 --> 01:53:46,318
It's exactly 5 metres away
from your location Arun.

1450
01:55:29,238 --> 01:55:31,568
Arun it's exactly at the same
spot where you are right now.

1451
01:56:12,274 --> 01:56:13,180
Sanjana...

1452
01:56:13,775 --> 01:56:17,324
-Sanjana get up! Are you ok?
-I'm ok sir.

1453
01:56:17,698 --> 01:56:19,406
-She didn't harm you right?
-I'm fine sir.

1454
01:56:19,606 --> 01:56:22,196
-Where is that lady?
-She went that way.

1455
01:56:22,396 --> 01:56:24,329
-You stay here, careful.
-Ok sir!

1456
01:56:48,404 --> 01:56:50,497
-Venkat, follow her!
-Okay Arun!

1457
01:57:00,623 --> 01:57:02,283
Ah!

1458
01:57:04,558 --> 01:57:07,493
-Venkat, are you ok?
-I'm fine.

1459
01:57:09,594 --> 01:57:10,453
Aah damn!

1460
01:58:49,356 --> 01:58:50,931
Vijay, check the 2000 batch.

1461
01:58:57,254 --> 01:58:59,489
Arun he's in Hyderabad presently.

1462
01:59:02,517 --> 01:59:07,287
The lady's name whom you are
searching is not Annabelle George.

1463
01:59:07,487 --> 01:59:09,283
She's Mary Fernandez.

1464
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:15,439
The one in this photo is
Fernandez, Mary's husband.

1465
01:59:16,364 --> 01:59:17,388
He was a magician.

1466
01:59:17,883 --> 01:59:19,592
This lady who was a music teacher,

1467
01:59:19,792 --> 01:59:23,568
started doing magic shows as
part-time job after his demise.

1468
01:59:29,698 --> 01:59:34,374
At the same stage, she introduced
her only son, Christopher to everyone.

1469
01:59:38,686 --> 01:59:43,078
But everyone were shocked
to see Christopher. Because,

1470
01:59:43,278 --> 01:59:48,393
he had a hormone disorder which made him
look like an old man even in childhood.

1471
01:59:49,021 --> 01:59:53,795
Because of which all the kids
didn't allow him to be close

1472
01:59:53,995 --> 01:59:54,854
Christopher!

1473
01:59:58,222 --> 02:00:00,100
Come here! I'm Sophia...

1474
02:00:00,133 --> 02:00:03,723
Mary felt happy, as Christopher
found a friend like Sophie.

1475
02:00:04,217 --> 02:00:05,368
-But none of Sophie's friends liked it.
-Come sit.

1476
02:00:08,997 --> 02:00:09,809
Let's eat.

1477
02:00:10,009 --> 02:00:14,880
Without letting this affect
Christopher, Mary took good care of him.

1478
02:00:16,143 --> 02:00:18,315
Happy Birthday to you!

1479
02:00:19,351 --> 02:00:20,547
Thank you Sophie!

1480
02:00:24,206 --> 02:00:28,901
Nothing to bother him again,
to make Christopher a best magician,

1481
02:00:29,406 --> 02:00:31,419
Mary started training him.

1482
02:00:40,049 --> 02:00:44,805
At the same time, Christopher
started to have feelings for Sophie.

1483
02:00:45,659 --> 02:00:48,967
-Sophia... Sophie...
-What's it? Tell me.

1484
02:00:56,567 --> 02:00:57,646
-Hey...
-Sophia

1485
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:59,312
-You're awesome
-I love you

1486
02:01:00,687 --> 02:01:02,281
Though Sophia was shocked by that

1487
02:01:02,643 --> 02:01:03,252
Sophie!

1488
02:01:03,452 --> 02:01:06,430
-Later, she tried to make him understand.
-Please leave this topic

1489
02:01:08,429 --> 02:01:10,127
But Christopher failed to understand

1490
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:12,792
and used to follow Sophie everywhere

1491
02:01:15,372 --> 02:01:19,181
Sophie started avoiding
Christopher since then

1492
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:21,794
Please talk to me, Sophia.

1493
02:01:22,064 --> 02:01:23,647
She doesn't want to talk to
you, why do you insist her to?

1494
02:01:23,915 --> 02:01:25,512
You get lost!

1495
02:01:26,328 --> 02:01:30,757
Sophia! Other than my mother, you are
the only one to show love on me.

1496
02:01:31,063 --> 02:01:33,400
Sophia couldn't bear it anymore.

1497
02:01:33,637 --> 02:01:35,232
-Come with me.
-Please Sophia!

1498
02:01:35,432 --> 02:01:39,121
She gave him books about
Genetics to read at her school library.

1499
02:01:39,345 --> 02:01:40,129
Read all these books

1500
02:01:40,819 --> 02:01:41,700
But why Sophia?

1501
02:01:42,150 --> 02:01:44,993
She explained him about
his hormone disorder.

1502
02:01:45,493 --> 02:01:47,903
Please don't say that Sophia, I'm normal!

1503
02:01:48,103 --> 02:01:49,877
Please Christopher, don't make me say it.

1504
02:01:50,077 --> 02:01:51,388
-I'm normal Sophia
-Please...

1505
02:01:52,332 --> 02:01:54,076
-Please read it.
-Please don't leave me Sophia.

1506
02:01:54,486 --> 02:01:57,542
Christopher was still
very stubborn to read.

1507
02:01:57,961 --> 02:02:01,130
Losing her temper, Sophie said,
'You are not fit for marriage'

1508
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:03,733
-'You are an impotent.'
-You are impotent

1509
02:02:03,933 --> 02:02:06,211
-She said he wasn't a male
-Don't disturb me please!

1510
02:02:06,711 --> 02:02:10,776
and warned him to never come after
her saying love and marriage.

1511
02:02:13,879 --> 02:02:15,212
Mom!

1512
02:02:23,833 --> 02:02:24,908
Mom...

1513
02:02:25,507 --> 02:02:26,508
That night...

1514
02:02:26,846 --> 02:02:32,798
He told Mary weeping about
his condition and how they hated him.

1515
02:02:33,293 --> 02:02:35,359
But his mother Mary, told that he
would become a renowned magician,

1516
02:02:35,859 --> 02:02:38,037
and consoled him a lot.

1517
02:02:45,591 --> 02:02:50,037
To boost his self-confidence
and cover his flaws...

1518
02:02:50,685 --> 02:02:53,075
she made a make-over for him.

1519
02:02:55,956 --> 02:02:58,585
He too left for school
with cheer and confidence.

1520
02:03:17,190 --> 02:03:20,985
The crowd calling 'Impotent'
disturbed Christopher a lot.

1521
02:03:50,493 --> 02:03:53,479
Hey!

1522
02:04:04,181 --> 02:04:06,542
Impotent! Impotent!

1523
02:04:40,738 --> 02:04:43,679
I'm sorry ma'am. I shouldn't have spoken
that way to Christopher the other day.

1524
02:04:43,996 --> 02:04:46,008
I had fever the next day,
so I didn't come to school.

1525
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:50,238
Mary understood it and asked
them both to be friends again...

1526
02:04:50,438 --> 02:04:52,585
and gave a gift to her.

1527
02:04:54,439 --> 02:04:55,494
Thank you ma'am

1528
02:05:10,579 --> 02:05:11,672
Send everyone away...

1529
02:05:11,872 --> 02:05:16,177
When I arrested his mother and took her,
I could see fear in everyone's eyes there.

1530
02:05:23,315 --> 02:05:24,481
A few days, after getting released,

1531
02:05:25,206 --> 02:05:27,886
I heard that they both were
dead in a fatal accident.

1532
02:05:28,726 --> 02:05:30,609
But I still can't
believe that she's alive,

1533
02:05:31,036 --> 02:05:34,930
and killing people
with the same vengeance.

1534
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:36,808
It's quite shocking.

1535
02:05:36,981 --> 02:05:40,095
Anyhow, you better arrest
her as soon as possible.

1536
02:05:40,521 --> 02:05:42,397
Else you have to witness a lot more deaths

1537
02:06:05,173 --> 02:06:06,200
Huh!

1538
02:06:14,237 --> 02:06:16,013
-Hello...
-Arun, Emergency!

1539
02:06:16,118 --> 02:06:16,916
What happened sir?

1540
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:18,737
<i>I saw the photos and videos you gave me.</i>

1541
02:06:19,003 --> 02:06:20,536
-Please come quick!
-Okay sir.

1542
02:06:56,718 --> 02:07:01,921
Sir... Sir!

1543
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:06,333
Hello Arun, Lakshmi madam learnt that
we met Jayaprakash sir and sent Sravan.

1544
02:07:06,533 --> 02:07:08,617
Venkat, she killed Jayaprakash sir.

1545
02:07:09,923 --> 02:07:11,826
-What are you talking?
-That lady should have killed him.

1546
02:07:12,026 --> 02:07:13,114
<i>She shouldn't have gone too far.</i>

1547
02:07:13,314 --> 02:07:15,334
-Please alert the surrounding areas.
-I will take care of that.

1548
02:07:15,534 --> 02:07:16,910
You move away from that place.

1549
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:22,219
<i>I saw the photos and videos you
gave me. I need to talk to you.</i>

1550
02:07:34,447 --> 02:07:35,373
Huh!

1551
02:07:35,573 --> 02:07:36,575
What are you doing here Arun?

1552
02:07:36,775 --> 02:07:38,876
Sir, I came here as Jayaprakash
sir asked me to come urgently.

1553
02:07:41,352 --> 02:07:42,430
One minute!

1554
02:07:44,295 --> 02:07:46,164
<i>Hello Madam, Yes Madam...</i>

1555
02:07:48,917 --> 02:07:52,521
Ok Madam! Lakshmi ma'am asked us to
arrest and bring you to the station.

1556
02:07:52,721 --> 02:07:54,395
Sir, what have I done sir?
By the time I came...

1557
02:07:54,595 --> 02:07:56,020
You better do not
utter a word and sit.

1558
02:07:56,220 --> 02:08:01,219
<i>Respond Respond! Don't spare any suspects.
Take them to station and interrogate.</i>

1559
02:08:28,103 --> 02:08:30,371
Hey what are you doing here? Watching fun?

1560
02:08:30,571 --> 02:08:32,016
Arrest him and get to the station.

1561
02:08:39,501 --> 02:08:40,760
Come Mr Arun!

1562
02:08:42,227 --> 02:08:45,712
Are you making everyone come
after you and enjoying that?

1563
02:08:45,912 --> 02:08:48,564
There's something serious beyond
what we found out in this case ma'am.

1564
02:08:48,764 --> 02:08:51,831
As I told, that killer lost her
mental stability and started to fumble.

1565
02:08:52,031 --> 02:08:53,902
That is why she started killing
those related to this case.

1566
02:08:54,102 --> 02:08:59,701
Hey stop it! I got you suspended as I
didn't want you to work on this case.

1567
02:09:00,662 --> 02:09:01,421
Ma'am please ma'am.

1568
02:09:01,621 --> 02:09:03,405
Hey, won't you listen to me at all?

1569
02:09:03,605 --> 02:09:04,627
-Sravan...
-Madam...

1570
02:09:04,827 --> 02:09:06,462
Take him, handcuff him and lock him up.

1571
02:09:06,662 --> 02:09:10,566
-Ma'am please ma'am! Listen to me!
-Come, tell me I'll listen.

1572
02:09:13,376 --> 02:09:14,712
Vishwanath get those handcuffs.

1573
02:09:20,228 --> 02:09:22,769
Come on sir, you are
treating him like an accused, handcuffs?

1574
02:09:22,969 --> 02:09:25,744
Do as we say, that will do!

1575
02:09:31,177 --> 02:09:34,005
<i>Alert, alert! CM convoy
has started from Begumpet.</i>

1576
02:09:36,551 --> 02:09:38,999
Uncle, where are the photos that
were brought from JP sir's house?

1577
02:09:39,199 --> 02:09:41,461
-They are in the shelf Arun.
-Do me a favour uncle.

1578
02:09:41,661 --> 02:09:42,959
Please give me those photos uncle.

1579
02:09:43,159 --> 02:09:44,777
They have to be sent to forensic lab.

1580
02:09:44,977 --> 02:09:46,323
Taking them out, might create a problem.

1581
02:09:47,509 --> 02:09:49,359
If that devil inside come to know...

1582
02:09:49,559 --> 02:09:52,741
Just 5 minutes uncle, I'll see if I
can find any clue in those photos.

1583
02:09:53,746 --> 02:09:54,741
Ok.

1584
02:10:01,393 --> 02:10:03,319
Here they are Arun. Just a minute...

1585
02:10:07,674 --> 02:10:09,631
Arun, wear these gloves.

1586
02:10:11,647 --> 02:10:13,107
Uncle, please drag that table here.

1587
02:10:45,066 --> 02:10:47,192
Uncle, this is the clue,
JP sir wanted to tell.

1588
02:10:47,981 --> 02:10:50,369
Look at this photo, this lady
has 6 fingers on her hand.

1589
02:12:04,208 --> 02:12:06,607
We are searching for a
wrong person all these days.

1590
02:12:07,691 --> 02:12:08,954
We arrested Arun sir.

1591
02:12:10,018 --> 02:12:11,689
We shall present him at your
committee tomorrow morning.

1592
02:12:11,889 --> 02:12:12,999
<i>No, that won't happen.</i>

1593
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:15,248
-Ok sir. Thank you sir.
-Ma'am...

1594
02:12:15,448 --> 02:12:17,897
Hey, who opened his handcuffs.

1595
02:12:18,497 --> 02:12:21,247
Ma'am please listen to me.
Please have a look at these photos.

1596
02:12:24,325 --> 02:12:27,802
These photos are supposed to be sent
to lab isn't it? How did you get them?

1597
02:12:28,002 --> 02:12:29,933
Hey Vishwanatham!

1598
02:12:30,133 --> 02:12:32,663
Ma'am we will never find that Psycho if
we search by the name Mary Fernandez.

1599
02:12:36,555 --> 02:12:39,595
Baby, didn't you sleep yet?

1600
02:12:39,795 --> 02:12:42,021
-Ma'am the person we're searching...
-You want me to sing you rhymes?

1601
02:12:42,221 --> 02:12:45,056
'Baby is drowsing cozy and fair'

1602
02:12:45,256 --> 02:12:47,891
'Mother sits nearby the rocking chair'

1603
02:12:48,091 --> 02:12:49,227
Ma'am!

1604
02:12:50,121 --> 02:12:53,117
'Forward and back she sways the cradle'

1605
02:12:53,317 --> 02:12:56,023
'Don't worry baby the mother is near'

1606
02:12:56,223 --> 02:12:58,321
-Ma'am this case is a very serious one.
-Good night!

1607
02:12:58,521 --> 02:12:59,849
Bye!

1608
02:13:01,665 --> 02:13:03,513
The psycho we are searching
is not Mary Fernandez.

1609
02:13:03,713 --> 02:13:05,716
It's her son Christopher,
we have that evidence in these photos.

1610
02:13:05,916 --> 02:13:08,306
As he doesn't know that we knew his
truth, he will be roaming carelessly.

1611
02:13:08,506 --> 02:13:10,464
<i>An Echo van is heading towards
Alwal, please check it.</i>

1612
02:13:11,164 --> 02:13:14,098
Are you trying to divert the
case with you filmy stories?

1613
02:13:14,298 --> 02:13:17,571
Ma'am city police will be searching for
that lady thinking she is the killer.

1614
02:13:17,771 --> 02:13:22,239
Hey name is Mary Fernandez. Age 40-45 yrs.
Gold hair, her face looks wrinkled.

1615
02:13:22,439 --> 02:13:25,194
We got information that
she's escaping in Echo vehicle.

1616
02:13:29,020 --> 02:13:31,752
Kavya... Sleep now!

1617
02:13:31,952 --> 02:13:33,213
Hmm!

1618
02:13:34,311 --> 02:13:37,301
Done for the day. Please sleep dear.

1619
02:13:40,426 --> 02:13:41,541
My sweet girl!

1620
02:13:49,717 --> 02:13:50,843
Hmm?

1621
02:14:05,209 --> 02:14:08,274
Ma'am please send me as a
police officer for this one night.

1622
02:14:08,474 --> 02:14:13,253
Oh really? You want us to send
you out and stay here like dumb?

1623
02:14:26,505 --> 02:14:28,343
Kavya... Stop playing!

1624
02:14:28,543 --> 02:14:29,630
-Mom...
-Huh?

1625
02:14:35,089 --> 02:14:37,250
Kavya get inside!

1626
02:15:03,698 --> 02:15:05,232
How will it workout if you
have such a stubborn mindset?

1627
02:15:05,432 --> 02:15:07,808
-Hey, get out!
-Please try to understand ma'am

1628
02:15:10,094 --> 02:15:11,627
We'll miss Christopher
because of your ego.

1629
02:15:12,969 --> 02:15:17,750
If you don't shut your mouth and go,
I shall lock you up naked in the cell.

1630
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:19,614
Arun, please pick up the call!

1631
02:15:28,546 --> 02:15:29,613
What is it Krishna?

1632
02:15:29,813 --> 02:15:34,403
Hello Arun, I am not sure who he is,
but he's trying to kill me and Kavya.

1633
02:15:34,603 --> 02:15:35,125
Krishna...

1634
02:15:35,325 --> 02:15:36,647
Where are you Arun?
Please come home quick.

1635
02:15:36,847 --> 02:15:39,554
<i>Krishna, what happened?
Please tell me Krishna!</i>

1636
02:15:39,754 --> 02:15:42,375
<i>Hello Hello Krishna...</i>

1637
02:15:42,575 --> 02:15:44,617
<i>Hello Krishna...</i>

1638
02:15:44,817 --> 02:15:46,115
Looks like he left!

1639
02:15:46,315 --> 02:15:47,631
How does he look?

1640
02:15:47,831 --> 02:15:49,255
He looks like an old man Arun.

1641
02:15:51,105 --> 02:15:51,809
Christopher!

1642
02:15:52,209 --> 02:15:53,926
Hello Krishna, is Kavya safe?

1643
02:15:54,126 --> 02:15:55,805
Yeah! Kavya is...

1644
02:15:56,605 --> 02:15:58,407
Kavya... Kavya...

1645
02:15:58,607 --> 02:15:59,687
Hello Krishna, what happened?

1646
02:15:59,887 --> 02:16:01,635
-Kavya...
<i>-Krishna.</i>..

1647
02:16:01,835 --> 02:16:03,367
-Krishna, what happened?
-Kavya...

1648
02:16:03,567 --> 02:16:04,915
Hello Krishna, what happened to Kavya?

1649
02:16:05,115 --> 02:16:07,034
<i>Kavya... Kavya...</i>

1650
02:16:07,234 --> 02:16:10,371
-Kavya...
-Krishna... Where is Kavya?

1651
02:16:10,581 --> 02:16:12,551
Arun, I think he took away Kavya.

1652
02:16:20,061 --> 02:16:21,764
Arun, please save Kavya.

1653
02:16:22,164 --> 02:16:23,788
Sir,what happened sir?

1654
02:16:24,188 --> 02:16:25,454
What happened to Kavya?

1655
02:16:25,654 --> 02:16:27,350
Christopher kidnapped Kavya.

1656
02:16:28,738 --> 02:16:30,516
Ma'am, Christopher has kidnapped Kavya.

1657
02:16:30,716 --> 02:16:32,116
Are you creating a scene?

1658
02:16:32,316 --> 02:16:35,055
-Hey, go and get the handcuffs.
-Ok ma'am.

1659
02:16:35,755 --> 02:16:40,128
You shouldn't step out of here,
until I produce you at the committee.

1660
02:16:40,628 --> 02:16:44,490
If you try to act smart, I will kill you.

1661
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:45,746
You can't ma'am.

1662
02:16:50,397 --> 02:16:52,974
Vishwanatham, have you lost your mind?

1663
02:16:53,174 --> 02:16:54,344
Aah...Arun!

1664
02:16:55,473 --> 02:16:57,764
-What are you doing Vishwanatham?
-Take it sir.

1665
02:16:59,584 --> 02:17:01,460
Vishwanatham... Hey!

1666
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,276
-Remove my handcuffs!
-No!

1667
02:17:06,739 --> 02:17:09,191
Such egoistic devils will
never understand anything sir.

1668
02:17:09,391 --> 02:17:12,753
I don't mind even losing my job,
please go and save the child.

1669
02:17:12,953 --> 02:17:15,404
-Listen to me!
-What is it? Stay there!

1670
02:17:22,295 --> 02:17:26,317
Madam is very furious. She doesn't
want anyone to disturb her until half hour

1671
02:17:26,517 --> 02:17:28,300
-Don't send anyone inside.
-Ok sir.

1672
02:17:38,725 --> 02:17:41,010
Hello excuse me!

1673
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:43,392
Hey old man! Hello!

1674
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:46,172
Your back wheel is loosened!

1675
02:17:47,762 --> 02:17:48,755
Hey old man!

1676
02:17:55,640 --> 02:17:57,143
Hey old man, check your back wheel.

1677
02:17:57,343 --> 02:17:59,258
<i>Hello Venkat!</i>
Hello Arun...

1678
02:17:59,458 --> 02:18:00,645
Could we get any clue about that lady?

1679
02:18:00,845 --> 02:18:02,912
That psycho is not a lady as we thought
earlier, it her son Christopher.

1680
02:18:03,112 --> 02:18:05,037
<i>He is the one who did the
murders in the disguise of an old lady.</i>

1681
02:18:05,237 --> 02:18:06,473
Now Kavya too is with him.

1682
02:18:06,673 --> 02:18:09,002
-What happened Arun?
-I'll tell you the details later Arun.

1683
02:18:09,202 --> 02:18:10,336
How do we identify Christopher?

1684
02:18:10,536 --> 02:18:11,522
That psycho has six fingers on his hand.

1685
02:18:11,722 --> 02:18:15,030
<i>Pass this information to
the patrol team immediately.</i>

1686
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:17,325
Ask them to pass the
information to all check posts

1687
02:18:17,525 --> 02:18:19,600
<i>Hello Venkat, hello
Venkat, can you hear me?</i>

1688
02:18:21,661 --> 02:18:23,576
<i>Venkat are you on line?</i>

1689
02:18:24,294 --> 02:18:25,501
<i>Hello Venkat,</i>

1690
02:18:26,219 --> 02:18:27,137
One minute Arun...

1691
02:18:27,337 --> 02:18:28,104
Christopher!

1692
02:18:29,576 --> 02:18:31,097
Hello Venkat, what happened?

1693
02:18:31,418 --> 02:18:32,822
Christopher get down!

1694
02:18:34,183 --> 02:18:35,220
I said get down.

1695
02:18:35,420 --> 02:18:36,531
<i>Venkat... are you there?</i>

1696
02:18:36,831 --> 02:18:37,769

Christopher get down!

1698
02:18:39,148 --> 02:18:41,348
Hey you... get down!

1699
02:18:44,855 --> 02:18:46,124
<i>Venkat, tell me quick, what happened?</i>

1700
02:18:47,218 --> 02:18:49,846
<i>Venkat... where are you now?</i>

1701
02:18:50,046 --> 02:18:51,674
Venkat, in which area are you now?

1702
02:18:51,874 --> 02:18:53,625
In the subway, beside
Dr Kishore's mortuary.

1703
02:18:53,825 --> 02:18:55,042
Hello Venkat, is Kavya there?

1704
02:18:57,026 --> 02:18:59,368
-Venkat, is Kavya there?
-One minute Arun...

1705
02:19:12,386 --> 02:19:14,193
Kavya is in the van. She's safe.

1706
02:19:14,393 --> 02:19:17,493
-Venkat do not think, shoot him.
-Christopher get down!

1707
02:19:18,679 --> 02:19:19,523
Come out!

1708
