1
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:29,708
Yes...
This was true once.

2
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:32,134
But, you can't say
the same about it today.

3
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,470
The politicians have polluted...

4
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:37,149
the atmosphere of this
nation by their dirty politics.

5
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:40,484
But, goodness
still prevails in the man.

6
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:43,486
This righteousness in him gave
birth to a man like Gandhi;...

7
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:46,555
who tried his best to
improve the lives of human beings.

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,152
And now, a school master named
Shri Satyendra Sharma...

9
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:52,759
has decided to
follow in his footsteps.

10
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,624
And, he has used politics as
a weapon to reform this society.

11
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:59,228
He won the elections.
As the people...

12
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,099
were fed up of the dirty politics
played by other the politicians...

13
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:07,469
voted for him hoping that he might
be able to fulfill their dreams.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,556
l'm very pleased to receive
all your love & faith.

15
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:23,723
But, l'm a very stubborn
& a disciplined man by nature.

16
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:26,856
As a teacher, l'm
quite aware of the fact...

17
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:29,125
spare the rods
& spoil the child.

18
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:33,294
But, this theory of mine
won't work in politics.

19
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,733
But, what can l do?

20
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:40,136
l'm not the one who will change with
the changing times & circumstances.

21
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:45,746
l therefore would like to present
before you all a proposition.

22
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,151
Only he can
become the Chief Minister...

23
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:54,157
who is the
most experienced in the party;...

24
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:57,558
one who is aware of
the political tactics...

25
00:01:58,165 --> 00:02:01,430
& one who has been supporting
the party for a very long time now.

26
00:02:02,102 --> 00:02:05,503
All these qualities are present
in Mr. Hirawat Chaudhari.

27
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:10,709
According to me, it would be best
if he be given this responsibility.

28
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:15,114
Master, you are giving me
a very big responsibility.

29
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:18,448
l alone will not be able
to handle this responsibility.

30
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:23,815
l agree to it only if you promise
to back me up & guide me all the way.

31
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,326
You are asking him to back you up
wherelse you should be backing him up.

32
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:29,823
We do not agree to it.

33
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,462
Respected Sir, like us, he too
has won his election by your help.

34
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,495
Sir, you will only have
to become the Chief Minister.

35
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:39,465
Because, we do not approve
of him becoming a C.M.

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,301
Sir, not only us,
but the public too disapproves of it.

37
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,138
That is true!
The public disapproves of it.

38
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:55,815
l, Satyendra Sharma,...
- l, Satyendra Sharma,...

39
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:58,487
pledge that...
- pledge that...

40
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,562
Under the Constitution of lndia...
- Under the Constitution of lndia.

41
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,759
... l shall perform my duties.
- ... l shall perform my duties.

42
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,363
The wife eloped
with her neighbour...

43
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:15,263
And the husband is so pleased
by it that he throws a party.

44
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:16,841
You are that kind of a man!

45
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:18,869
... & shall do it sincerely.

46
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,540
He beat you fair and square.

47
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,583
And when he reached the top,
you were a nonentity to him.

48
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,284
Take no offence!

49
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:30,514
You are watching him on the tube.
Enjoying the show with this cop!

50
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:34,291
Hey! What are you looking at?
Switch off the television.

51
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,731
Do you remember what
surety he had given to us?

52
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,626
He was so damn sure
that he would become the C.M.

53
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:47,368
He was so confident that he had
the backing of all the M.L.A.'s.

54
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,635
But instead,
they stabbed you in your back.

55
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:54,136
Take no offence!
- Mr. Katkar, control yourself.

56
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,475
What if he's not the Chief minister?
He is still the Home Minister.

57
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:00,217
Don't you worry now.
- Shouldn't l worry, huh?

58
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,078
Whose money went down the drain?
Not yours but mine, get it!

59
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:08,083
He who has faced this big
a loss can't control himself.

60
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:11,653
What use is it to me if he
has become the Home Minister?

61
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,364
The one who has become the C.M.
is like an iron rod; red & hot.

62
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:20,101
He will destroy
everything he touches.

63
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:22,765
l too have come from
the Darba district.

64
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,241
As long as
l'm the Home Minister,...

65
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:27,709
all your business shall run
in the same manner as before.

66
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:31,445
But l promise you this.
You can have my hide...

67
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:34,720
if l fail to overthrow this
C.M. within a month's time.

68
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,713
Oh yeah!
You will overthrow him!

69
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:41,455
Have you ever heard of a mouse escape
a cat's claws & feast on the cat?

70
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,117
Damn you!

71
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:47,125
l may be an illiterate, but
nobody can make a fool out of me.

72
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:48,798
Take no offence!

73
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,660
Sir, something terrible has happened.
- What happened?

74
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,469
Jeevanram has learnt
of your election scam.

75
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:57,470
Sir, he is going to file a case
against you with all the evidences.

76
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:01,203
Problem!
Major problem...

77
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:05,083
Looks like, l saw myself in the
morning to have such a worst day.

78
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,087
Hey Chaudhari, better
get one thing straight.

79
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,488
l shan't spare you if my
business gets affected by all this.

80
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:20,089
Hey, what's all this whispering
going on at the back?

81
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,759
Hope you remember my name.
lt's Katkar.

82
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:27,499
l've wasted many a lives
to reach where l'm standing now.

83
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:30,699
Wasting one more will make me no
difference if l am under a threat.

84
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,840
Take no offence!

85
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,646
Jeevanram is a very honest man.
The people too adores him.

86
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:41,278
The C.M. might learn of
this if he went to a trial.

87
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:45,114
And, it will be a big problem
if the C.M. learns about this.

88
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:50,722
That will be possible only if
he manages to reach the court.

89
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,562
What did you say?
Won't you give us the ticket?

90
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,728
Don't you know that
we are Spot Nana's men?

91
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:58,795
Now tell me if you
will give us the tickets.

92
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,336
To hell with your Spot Nana.
Take a hike now!

93
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,350
Move from the way...
lt's Spot Nana...

94
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:07,234
The show is over. How much you
watched was more than enough.

95
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:09,301
Better get out now.

96
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:15,337
One more thing.

97
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:19,508
Don't come back here. This was
the last show to be shown here.

98
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,634
Nana, please stop!
Please wait!

99
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,837
l beg of you!

100
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,776
You want to cause trouble?
- No sir... l'm sorry sir.

101
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:50,109
lt was the new booking clerk.
He did not know anything about you.

102
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:53,782
From now on, he will not work here.
- He won't.

103
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:56,719
You will first give the tickets
to my men.

104
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,114
And only then will you sell
the tickets to the public.

105
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,351
And only if any are left over.
- Okay sir.

106
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,492
Else, you will be the one
to suffer, get it!

107
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:06,663
l do.

108
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,571
He is Nana.

109
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,240
Speak up.

110
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,635
Did you understand?
- Yes, l did.

111
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,747
l'll be the one to fix the rate.

112
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:58,106
l want the whole
amount before the kill.

113
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,711
All right.

114
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,725
Can we expect this headline in the
evening tabloid day after tomorrow?

115
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:11,053
Have you any problem if
you get this news by tomorrow?

116
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,065
Tomorrow at 8 a.m.
he will be marked for death;...

117
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,727
at 9 we will make the kill...

118
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:22,064
& by 10 a.m. his body will
be on the autopsy table.

119
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:29,339
But remember one thing.
My name should not leak out.

120
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:35,748
When l murder somebody, the only
thing that leaks out is blood.

121
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,718
Where is the
photograph of the party?

122
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,699
Why did you stop the bus again?
l've got to reach the court fast!

123
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,803
Get moving!
- SlLENCE!

124
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,438
One word out of your mouth & l shall
have your tongues. Sit down!

125
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,478
Hey, what's all this going on?

126
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,495
The case of Jeevanram's murder
is false & holds no ground.

127
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,694
The court has reached the verdict
after a thorough investigation...

128
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:06,194
Because of losing
in the election,...

129
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,101
the deceased had
become mentally unstable.

130
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,703
He therefore threw himself before
a running train & committed suicide.

131
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,806
The court accepts this motive as a
substantial reason & closes the case.

132
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:02,093
What is all this?
- This is your security.

133
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,427
Mr. Home Minister,...

134
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:06,588
we should be giving the
security to the public...

135
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:09,767
& not use the people's tax
money for our own security.

136
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:13,761
Sir, please try to
understand our duty too.

137
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,543
All right then.

138
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:22,445
For your satisfaction you may post
two constables outside the gate.

139
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:26,813
There is no need for them to
follow me around like my shadow.

140
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,385
He is there to protect me.

141
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:34,787
With my God with me,
l don't need any security.

142
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:38,123
Kindly remove all these securities
& the wire barricades from here.

143
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:55,144
Sir, your tank's full.
You have to pay me Rs. 350.

144
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,607
Good boy!
- Sir, how about paying me up?

145
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:02,082
Pay you up?

146
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,488
Why are you laughing?
Pay me up.

147
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,455
How dare you ask us to pay you up.

148
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:12,360
Don't you know whose vehicle
is this? lt belongs to Nana.

149
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:14,523
l don't care whom it belongs to.
All l want is for you to pay me up.

150
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,625
Else my boss will beat me up.
- Get lost!

151
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:20,431
No Gas station ever
demands Nana's men to pay up.

152
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:23,798
Go & tell that to your boss.
- Please don't do this. l'm new here.

153
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:36,249
Who the hell are you?
New in town?

154
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,681
Can't you guess it from his looks?

155
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:03,208
Open your mouth & you will
first burn from the inside...

156
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:05,740
and then from the outside.

157
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:08,777
Those days are gone long...

158
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,756
when one could bully over
everyone by one name.

159
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:18,093
l'm here to teach all you
law-breakers a good lesson.

160
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,697
Go & tell this to your Nana.

161
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:30,371
Nana, all our autos are
running on the meter now.

162
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:34,268
He has shut down all our clubs
& illegal business of sex trade.

163
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,112
He has even beaten
up our men like flies.

164
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,782
He has threatened us
to strip us publicly...

165
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,451
if we are ever seen in
the market for extortion.

166
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:44,714
He made me drink petrol.

167
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:49,117
Bro, he is a very dangerous man.
We'll have to do something quick.

168
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,593
Tell us what we have to do.
Get him or get rid of him?

169
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:55,799
Cops have many a pockets.

170
00:15:56,636 --> 00:16:00,504
And he goes mad if his pockets
remain left empty for a long time.

171
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,457
Hello man!
Everyone drops in to greet me.

172
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,387
But, l had to visit
you to greet you.

173
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:31,092
People call me Nana...
Spot Nana.

174
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:39,101
Every lnspector who comes new
to the post reports to me first.

175
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:41,803
You didn't come...
Never mind...

176
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:46,112
You stopped the
extortion business of my men.

177
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,610
That didn't make me mad.

178
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:54,722
Oh yes! l came to know that you
made one of my man drink petrol.

179
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,127
l liked it!

180
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:02,063
By God! l'm very pleased to
hear the tales of your bravery.

181
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:06,404
And l should be.
The police should he this strict.

182
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:09,064
Else, there is no
fun in braking the law.

183
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:11,399
You give us the warning;...

184
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:14,511
we pay you to keep your
mouth shut; that's customary.

185
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,708
And, this has been going on
since the birth of cops & robbers.

186
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:21,475
Junior!

187
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:34,089
How do you want to be paid up?

188
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,097
Every week or month...

189
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,764
or on every festivals a 50-50 cut
& a special gift on the 31st.

190
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:47,109
The political movement of
this entire city is run by me.

191
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:52,105
The Ministers & the Mayors
are very close to me.

192
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,112
l will also try for your promotion.
What have you to say for this?

193
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:15,398
Have you taken this
police station to be your club?

194
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,737
Hey you!
You don't know my brother yet.

195
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:21,643
l've no need to know him.

196
00:18:22,415 --> 00:18:24,178
All l know is that,...

197
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:27,580
all of you are the illegitimate
up bringing of a weak politics.

198
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:34,086
Only because you have the backing of
a couple of corrupt greedy leaders...

199
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:42,091
do you dare to act too smart.
Better get one thing straight.

200
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:53,102
l'm here to teach all you who dares
to toy with the law a good lesson.

201
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:02,383
Nana is not used to hearing a ' No'.
Think over it once more.

202
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:06,714
Think again...

203
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:12,494
Junior, get the car.

204
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:15,632
Now, l'll be the one to think.

205
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:19,060
Now, l'll have to do
whatever has to be done of you.

206
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,751
Step outside &
then take the permission.

207
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,417
Now may l come in sir?
- What do you want?

208
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,093
l prefer to make friendship
where there is sincerity.

209
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,555
My name is Anees.
l represent the Janvani newspaper.

210
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,098
So what?

211
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,602
l heard tales about you
& your heroics.

212
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:55,807
l've thus come here
to congratulate you.

213
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,702
According to me, if an honest
journalist & a sincere cop...

214
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,636
were to join hands, they could
be a great help to each other.

215
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,542
What business have you with me?

216
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:06,250
l've some information about the
M.L.A. Jeevanram's murder.

217
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,179
Speak up.

218
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,555
Let me hear you clap, children...

219
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:50,556
here comes the toy-seller

220
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:05,106
Take your pick...
everything's worth just a rupee

221
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,116
They aren't just clay-toys.
They are every child's dream

222
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,760
So clap for me, children...
here's the toy-seller

223
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:07,504
Without any money,
how will anyone buy toys?

224
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:15,512
Take away whatever
you wish to...

225
00:22:16,415 --> 00:22:18,110
you can pay me later

226
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,512
l'm poor...
but l possess a big heart

227
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:16,099
l live in a faraway village,
and my feet hurt

228
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:26,508
l've walked a long distance...
to get to Bombay

229
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:33,524
And people in Bombay say
l have an enticing gait

230
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,750
Some days ago, a murder
took place on the Gorai beach.

231
00:24:04,189 --> 00:24:07,420
A girl of this slum was
has witnessed that homicide.

232
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,091
You know very well
what kind of a man l'm.

233
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:16,098
Whoever that girl is,
better come out of hiding.

234
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:19,603
lf l'm forced to make the
first move, l'll skin her alive.

235
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:23,107
Now tell me who she is.
Tell me!

236
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:38,720
Why are you so afraid?

237
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:42,116
Were you the one
who witnessed the homicide?

238
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:44,122
l did not.
- Tell me truth.

239
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:45,786
No...
- TELL Me!

240
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:48,531
No, l did not see anything.
- How dare you lie to me!

241
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:53,701
Hey, what are you doing?

242
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,806
Aren't you ashamed of yourself
to raise your hands on a girl?

243
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:58,473
You haven't even seen the girl
& you simply began to beat her up.

244
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:01,540
That girl doesn't even belong to
here nor has she witnessed anything.

245
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:12,081
Then, have you witnessed it?
- NO... l... n o...

246
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,651
Oh God!
She is going to be arrested!

247
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,503
One who commits crime is a criminal.

248
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:27,795
But one who does not bring the crime
into the open is a bigger criminal.

249
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:31,108
Why didn't you report the murder
when you witnessed the homicide?

250
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:34,105
What use would it have been?

251
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:37,446
The good guys & the bad guys
would have joined hands.

252
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:40,380
The bad guys
wouldn't have been punished.

253
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:43,117
But, they would have
surely come to punish me.

254
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:46,786
They would have beaten me up
& broken down my house.

255
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:51,727
lt's better to keep one's hands away
from the fire than to play with it.

256
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:53,525
Silence!

257
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:56,858
How do you suppose this mobocracy
will end if everyone chickened out?

258
00:25:57,536 --> 00:25:59,128
The mobsters are gaining grounds...

259
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:01,502
because they feed on the
primal fear of people like you.

260
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,070
You will have to appear in the court.
- Heck no l won't!

261
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,070
Forget the court.

262
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:08,510
lf they came to know that l had
been to the police station,...

263
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:11,079
they will burn down
my entire neighbourhood.

264
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:14,408
The cops too will help them out.
- Don't talk nonsense!

265
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,084
The man who was
murdered was nobody to you.

266
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:19,653
You therefore don't want to
stand witness, am l not right?

267
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:22,754
Would you have still kept mum if that
man had been your related to you?

268
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,097
Listen to me. Whatever
you said about the police...

269
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,097
Perhaps all that is true. But,
not every policemen are alike.

270
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:33,334
Atleast, l'm not like that.

271
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,502
Your testimony will
put them behind bars.

272
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:42,104
l promise that no harm will come
either to you or your neighbours.

273
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:49,881
ls that so? That puny girl has
such guts to testify against Nana!

274
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:52,781
Junior!
- Yes brother!

275
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,790
We have to take
care of her today itself.

276
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:58,693
Ravish her early in the morning.

277
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:01,065
By afternoon,
she will comply to us.

278
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:05,061
lf she does not, throw her
on the railway tracks by evening.

279
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:07,731
l'll take care of
the political hassles.

280
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:10,731
But, be on the spot on time.

281
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:05,555
No...

282
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,222
no...

283
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:11,256
NO...

284
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,426
lt didn't go as l had planned.

285
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:52,261
But whatever happened,
happened for the best.

286
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:59,100
She alone is the witness
to the murder l committed.

287
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:03,711
lf she is sentenced for this
homicide she committed;...

288
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:06,516
that would take me off the hook
and she will rot in prison.

289
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:08,683
Now did you see, sir?

290
00:30:09,187 --> 00:30:13,123
What did l get in return
for aiding the law?

291
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:24,728
Your Honour, l would
therefore request the court...

292
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:27,128
that having been found
guilty of this brutal crime,...

293
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:29,339
Shanti be severely punished.

294
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:34,476
Have you anything
to say in your favour?

295
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:37,738
l'm but an illiterate girl.

296
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:41,151
What would l know what
these twisted big words mean?

297
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:46,150
What can l say before these learned
people present in the courtroom?

298
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:50,154
lt is true
that l killed that man.

299
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,861
Just now
public prosecutor said that...

300
00:30:56,168 --> 00:31:00,161
a woman is regarded with
great dignity in our nation.

301
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:04,635
But that man tired to
ravish me before everyone.

302
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:10,109
l cried; shouted for help, but
my cries went unheard by everyone.

303
00:31:10,448 --> 00:31:16,114
No father nor
brother came to my aid.

304
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:23,458
l went to save my honour
& he died by accident.

305
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:39,139
After going through
the entire proceedings,...

306
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:41,809
the court has
reached a verdict that,...

307
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:44,808
the accused Shanti is guilty of...
- That is right, Your Honour.

308
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,147
Shanti has committed this murder.
But, the court should also know...

309
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,150
why & under which circumstances
did she commit this crime.

310
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:55,148
Therefore, before you
reach your verdict,...

311
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:58,487
l seek your permission to present
in the court an important witness.

312
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,098
You have my permission.

313
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,436
Your Honour, l hope that once this
box is open, justice will be done.

314
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,331
And, you will pass a correct verdict.
- What is in this box?

315
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:14,509
lt would be best
if you saw if for yourself.

316
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:42,865
What's the meaning of all this?
What kind of a dirty joke was this?

317
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:46,644
You are a police officer & yet you
committed the contempt of court!

318
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:50,739
l apologize to you.

319
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:53,811
l did this not to
offend the court,...

320
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:59,153
but to do justice &
to unveil the truth.

321
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:01,686
Stop beating around the bush
& make yourself clear.

322
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:04,561
Whatever do you wish
to prove by your antics?

323
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:08,258
l had already extracted
the poisonous sting...

324
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,526
from the scorpion
that you just crushed.

325
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,430
lf l had not done that & this
insect had happened to bite you,...

326
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:17,603
you'd have felt a little pain
but not lost your life.

327
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:20,304
And you mercilessly
crushed it to it's death...

328
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:22,104
in cold blood without
even giving it a second thought.

329
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:25,773
May l ask you why?
- To save myself, of course!

330
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:30,217
ln exactly the same manner,...

331
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:32,446
Shanti happened to kill
a man just to save herself.

332
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:34,715
That scorpion was harmful,...

333
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:38,493
but the men who meant to dishonour
her indeed meant her harm;...

334
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,459
devils cloaked in flesh.

335
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,132
The circumstances under which
Shanti committed this murder...

336
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,734
if this very circumstances
were to come across my sister...

337
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:50,665
or your daughter
or this gentleman's wife...

338
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:53,633
what do you expect they will do?
They will do exactly the same thing.

339
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:02,747
l will only make
one final request to the court.

340
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,280
Looking at the circumstances on hand
& regarding the true intentions...

341
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:09,085
behind the crime, l would like you
to reach your verdict.

342
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,870
The proceedings of the public
prosecutor clearly proves that...

343
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:26,776
that the accused
Shanti is guilty of murder.

344
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:29,475
And this is a very serious offence.

345
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:33,112
Shanti has committed this crime
in order to save her honour.

346
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:36,543
lf she is guilty then so am l.

347
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:42,125
Because, l too have mercilessly
ended a life to save myself.

348
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:48,122
But in the eyes of the law it's not a
crime to kill someone in self defence.

349
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:53,560
Considering the circumstantial
evidences and the true intentions...

350
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:57,597
the court dismisses all
charges on Shanti and acquits her.

351
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:02,406
She is out!

352
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,821
Who did this?
- l did it sir.

353
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:25,094
Nana's men have threatened to kill us
& our kin if we opened up this door.

354
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,471
What the hell are you saying?
Where will she stay?

355
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,574
lnstead of leaving
her behind to die,...

356
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:33,709
better arrest her for any
charges and send her to prison.

357
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:36,706
She will atleast
live there with dignity.

358
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:49,850
Please come inside.

359
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:02,667
Why are you standing over there?

360
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:08,076
Till now, the world
is only condemning me alone.

361
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,779
But, if l'm to step
into this house,...

362
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:14,751
you too could become
the target of malignation.

363
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:18,087
l know very well
how to tackle such people.

364
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,082
No need for you
to worry what others say.

365
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:23,316
Come inside.

366
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:28,565
Didn't you hear me?

367
00:36:37,442 --> 00:36:43,312
What happened now?
- Till when will l be staying here?

368
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:47,107
You are as much ignorant
in this matter as l am.

369
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:50,117
Your neighbours were not
capable enough to protect you.

370
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:52,251
l've therefore brought you here.

371
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,789
lf you continued to stay there,
those mobs could take you in anytime.

372
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:03,058
lf you stayed here, no harm
could ever come to you.

373
00:37:04,202 --> 00:37:07,729
Get that?
Now, go inside.

374
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:13,076
Sir, just one more question.

375
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,235
We have heard that you
are going to ban alcohol.

376
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:18,609
Why are you so much against these
things? Any particular reason for it?

377
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,347
What did you say your name was?
- Anees.

378
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,076
You represent the
Janvani newspaper, don't you?

379
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:25,087
Yes sir.
- Do you have alcohol?

380
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:28,555
No way.
- Then do one thing.

381
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,493
One of these days, try out some
alcohol & go to your wife.

382
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:36,089
She will give you such a
long answer to your question...

383
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:39,095
that will fill up
your entire paper.

384
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:43,096
You've got a good sense of humour.
- That's the problem!

385
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:46,702
This plague that has spread
in our society like cancer...

386
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:49,112
is taken very lightly by everyone.

387
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:54,111
The way a man squanders his hard
earned money on this dirty water...

388
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:56,116
by the end of the day,...

389
00:37:56,521 --> 00:38:00,389
his kids have to go hungry
because of their father's bad habit.

390
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:05,052
His wife doesn't find
this funny at all.

391
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:11,729
Sir, the promises you made to the
people, do you mean to keep them all?

392
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:14,394
At the time of the election,...

393
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:17,505
many a promises are made to
the public to get their votes.

394
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:21,409
But, it is not only difficult but
quite impossible to fulfill them all.

395
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,538
The people are not
questioning you but me.

396
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,553
And, l do not want
anyone to speak on my behalf.

397
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:35,754
A promise is a promise &
l will definitely honour them.

398
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,595
Yes sir!
- Always remember one thing.

399
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:45,595
Politicians promise a lot of things.

400
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:51,440
But, do not publish what l promise.
Publish what l do.

401
00:39:09,227 --> 00:39:11,218
Hey, what are you doing?
Get down.

402
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:16,465
Nothing.
l was only cleaning the cobwebs.

403
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:20,060
No need for you to slog yourself. The
cleaning woman will be here any minute

404
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:23,065
Anything wrong if l do the chores?

405
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:27,071
What?
- You worry about the whole world.

406
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,346
l wish to stay here as your
maid and take care of you.

407
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:35,313
You don't ha...

408
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,083
Then, l too won't feel that
l'm burden to you.

409
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:43,483
l've heated the water.
You may go & have your bath.

410
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:05,105
The food's delicious.

411
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:10,481
Hey, all of you clear up!
What's going on?

412
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:12,816
The C.M. is inside.

413
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:15,116
Mr. C.M.!
- Yes sir.

414
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:16,657
Good day to you sir.

415
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:20,692
Hello sir.

416
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,135
Siddhant, is it really you?

417
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:43,143
lt's more fun travelling in your
police jeep than in my armored car.

418
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:46,145
Thank you sir.
- Forget your thank you.

419
00:40:46,557 --> 00:40:49,492
After shifting in this city,
why didn't you come to meet me?

420
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:52,561
l so mush wish to come & meet you.

421
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:56,164
But, l haven't achieved
anything in my life till now.

422
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,762
l shall meet you once l've
achieved something in my life.

423
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,334
You should be proud to
introduce me as your student.

424
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:04,905
You are absolutely right.

425
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,442
l've heard many
a tales of your bravery.

426
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:12,509
l've also heard that you are
very strict with your criminals.

427
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,779
My job requires me
to flex my muscles.

428
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:18,787
l do try my best
not to get so carried away.

429
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:24,693
But when l see the criminals
toying away with the law,...

430
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:27,560
l just don't know
what happens to me then.

431
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:31,734
Now, you have become
a responsible police officer.

432
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:34,668
When will you change if not now?

433
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,140
Can you say you have changed after
you have become the Chief Minister?

434
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:41,134
You still look like
the same old school teacher.

435
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,146
No one can beat you
in an argument.

436
00:41:45,416 --> 00:41:49,682
But, l really felt very good
when l saw you in this uniform.

437
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:53,154
Sir, l owe this all to
your rod that you used on me.

438
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:55,651
All l seek is
your blessings that...

439
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:00,593
l may only bow before my duty
& you & not before anyone else.

440
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:08,794
Wait...

441
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:15,106
lnspector, you are just
a beginner before me.

442
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:17,707
No need for you to
feel great about yourself.

443
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:21,778
Else, it won't even take me
a minute to suspend you.

444
00:42:23,554 --> 00:42:25,545
And, don't you presume
that all because...

445
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:27,816
you have the backing of the
C.M., you can do what you wish.

446
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,451
What have l done?
- What have you done??

447
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,686
The day you gave the lift to the
Chief Minister in your jeep,...

448
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,620
you were in your uniform.

449
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:39,133
Onlookers might think that the
police drools over the politicians.

450
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:42,802
Such a thing does not suit
police officers like you.

451
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:44,840
Before you do anything,...

452
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:46,700
you should first think about
the image of your department.

453
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:48,540
Which l'm afraid to say,
you have been forgetting.

454
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,509
From now on, whatever
decisions you have to make...

455
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:54,544
or whichever duty you have to
do, do it with my permission.

456
00:42:54,886 --> 00:42:58,720
And, what if you are not available.
- Then, wait for me to get back.

457
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,484
lf some mishap occurs in the meantime?

458
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:01,683
l'll handle everything
when l come back.

459
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,623
Whatever will you handle
after everything's over?

460
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,753
One more thing.

461
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:09,758
Heard that you are again opening up
the case of Jeevanram's murder.

462
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:13,432
That case is closed
& shall remain so.

463
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:15,102
But sir, l've sufficient evidence...

464
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:26,442
Oh yes! l shall shut down that
case & burn up all the evidences...

465
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:30,119
l'll turn my face away from justice
just in order to keep up my job.

466
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:35,584
A police officer wants to
do his duty with sincerity.

467
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:39,119
And so many obstacles &
obstructions in his path of duty!

468
00:43:46,304 --> 00:43:48,295
Nobody is supporting me.

469
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,698
Not one leader;
not one officer;...

470
00:43:51,142 --> 00:43:54,509
not even a soul is there
to support me in my crusade.

471
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,678
Everyone calls me stubborn & cruel.

472
00:43:58,249 --> 00:44:02,083
But, there is no one to
felicitate me on my good work.

473
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,351
To say that what
l'm doing is right.

474
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:06,590
No one... no one at all...

475
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,457
Yes... l want it.

476
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:22,095
l want something like that.

477
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:27,110
l want someone to
understand my feelings.

478
00:44:28,112 --> 00:44:30,512
l want someone who can support me.

479
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:36,111
l want someone to help me
in my journey of justice.

480
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:39,348
Yes, l want...

481
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:51,133
You always use two hands to clap.

482
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:54,803
ln your case,
you too are at fault.

483
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:57,797
They take advantage
of your hot temper,...

484
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:00,243
only because you
can't control yourself.

485
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:02,737
The reason they are putting up
barriers all around you...

486
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,241
is because they think
you are a dangerous man.

487
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:09,077
Do not try to
drift away from the tide.

488
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:12,612
lf you want, you can very easily
save yourself from all these hassles.

489
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:15,749
Really!
- Yes.

490
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,593
Keep your opinion &
your emotions to yourself.

491
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,228
Why don't you chill out a bit?

492
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:24,765
You can do your duty even
with tenderness, can't you?

493
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:28,763
Why don't you use a little of both
your wit & wisdom to outwit them?

494
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:34,567
l can't...
l can't use my wit & wisdom.

495
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:37,580
Do you know why?

496
00:45:38,115 --> 00:45:42,279
Because, l wasn't born in the
midst of love & care as you were.

497
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:45,855
l don't know
what a lullaby means.

498
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:49,722
l never knew what
a mother's love meant.

499
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:52,458
l was never
guided by my father.

500
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:57,289
l've grown up facing hardships
& brutality of this world.

501
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:00,132
Therefore, l turned out
to be a stubborn man.

502
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:03,067
l don't have that
tender loving attitude in me.

503
00:46:04,675 --> 00:46:07,337
What do you know about me?

504
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:12,071
l was the illegitimate
child of my parents.

505
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:15,775
My birth was not
welcome, but forced upon...

506
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:19,751
which finally
landed me in a trash can.

507
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:24,084
l'm nothing but a trash
come out of a trash can.

508
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:28,426
An orphan...
that's what l am.

509
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:04,067
This unfortunate child...

510
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:08,465
cursed by destiny...

511
00:47:09,473 --> 00:47:13,409
in this huge, vast world...

512
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:17,479
he's without any support

513
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:09,465
Right from his childhood...

514
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:13,464
he hasn't a father
to protect him...

515
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:18,471
neither did his mother
sing lullabies for him...

516
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:23,069
nor did she feed him her milk

517
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:27,476
He swallows his tears...

518
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:32,077
to live on

519
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:23,061
Before it's too late...

520
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:27,472
before devastation strikes

521
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:32,480
may someone take his
hand to steady him...

522
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:37,481
before he's lost to the world

523
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:42,081
He was born out of
someone's blunders...

524
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:46,490
but he is
society's delicate flower

525
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:11,113
One who lived like
a dog on throw away foods;...

526
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:16,391
one who roamed the
streets like a vagrant...

527
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:19,118
was given shelter by my Guru.

528
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:25,659
He provided for me all
the necessities of life.

529
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:30,537
He is not only my guru,
but my father; my God!

530
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:33,807
ls it wrong on my part
to share my feelings with him?

531
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:36,803
ls it wrong to give
him a lift in my jeep?

532
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:39,672
l care a damn what
people talks about me.

533
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:44,416
l can even lay
down my life for him.

534
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:47,680
Protocol...
To hell with the protocol.

535
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,705
How beautiful the colours come out of
the hands that are stained with blood.

536
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:06,706
But, why had she
committed the murder?

537
00:51:07,544 --> 00:51:11,105
Her customer must
have refused to pay her up.

538
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:14,540
But, why has an lnspector
brought home a murderer?

539
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,451
What could he do? The poor man
must have felt quite lonely.

540
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:19,712
He need someone to take care of him.

541
00:51:20,124 --> 00:51:23,116
They both needed each other.

542
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:25,518
That way, they can
give company to each other.

543
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,121
lt is not good for this girl to
continue living in our neighbourhood.

544
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:29,788
She should be
thrown out of our society.

545
00:51:30,134 --> 00:51:32,125
She should be thrown out.

546
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:39,741
Don't they make a cute couple;
a murderer and a cop?

547
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:46,744
Hey, did you see that?

548
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:49,142
How the heroine stopped
her hero right in his tracks?

549
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:53,880
That sure reminds me
of a scene from a movie.

550
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:10,237
What did you just say?
- Loafer.

551
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:13,771
Stop it!

552
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:17,304
Just becuase you are a police man
you think you can hit anybody?

553
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:20,114
You think you can commit any crime!
Why are you hitting him?

554
00:52:20,517 --> 00:52:24,578
What wrong did he say?
Tell me, what is she to you?

555
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,131
Every man & a woman has a
relationship between each other.

556
00:52:36,567 --> 00:52:38,467
One who gives birth is a mother;...

557
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:41,727
One who ties a rakhi is a sister;
One who marries him is a wife.

558
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:43,738
Every relationship has a name.

559
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:47,133
Tell us how should
we address your relationship?

560
00:53:22,112 --> 00:53:24,103
You all had asked me a question.

561
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:27,109
The answer to it
can be seen on her face.

562
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:29,509
From now on, this woman is my wife.

563
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:36,887
And, if anyone dared to speak a word
against my wife shall lose his tongue.

564
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:45,495
God bless you both.
Please get up.

565
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:49,134
Forgive me sir.

566
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,532
After our wedding, we had come to
visit you to take your blessings.

567
00:53:53,143 --> 00:53:55,134
But, you were not home.

568
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:58,844
All this happened so fast that,...
- l've heard everything.

569
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:02,074
l came right over as soon
as l got the news.

570
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:06,454
My son, this is the first time you
have done a good deed in your life.

571
00:54:08,091 --> 00:54:13,427
My dear, you are very innocent.
He is so stubborn & defiant.

572
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:16,424
Will you be able to cope up with him?

573
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:20,569
Afraid, aren't you?
Don't you worry now.

574
00:54:21,772 --> 00:54:26,106
He may be temperamental,
but he's good at heart.

575
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:31,314
Since his childhood, l beat him up
to improve him as best as l could.

576
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:33,680
But, he did not.

577
00:54:34,117 --> 00:54:38,781
Perhaps, you could change him
by your love is what l hope.

578
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:42,119
You will try your best, won't you?
- Yes.

579
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:48,560
Why do you look so glum?
You have got married today.

580
00:54:49,132 --> 00:54:51,464
How about giving me
a smile atleast today?

581
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:56,628
ls that a smile l see on our face?
My dear, look at him smiling.

582
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:43,115
lt never happened,
l never saw it...

583
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,820
l heard of it,
never did l read about it

584
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:48,522
lt never happened,
l never saw it...

585
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:51,526
l never heard of it,
never did l read about it

586
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:54,524
l never stole a heart,
nor did l give my heart...

587
00:55:55,132 --> 00:56:00,126
nor did l take it, not give it...
l did nothing

588
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:06,065
The way we've fallen in love,
nobody ever has

589
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:04,465
You took deep breaths...

590
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:08,469
but you never missed me

591
00:57:17,414 --> 00:57:22,477
Even if we asked each other our
names, it was after our marriage

592
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:28,089
l looked for nothing,
l sought nothing...

593
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:31,091
l asked for nothing,
l knew nothing

594
00:58:23,246 --> 00:58:28,479
What made you suddenly
take my hand?

595
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:36,492
My heart was perhaps
heeding your heart's plea

596
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:42,095
l know not, you know not...

597
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:45,091
lt isn't my mistake, nor yours

598
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:46,495
Believe it or not...

599
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:52,491
we're carrying on our love
from our previous birth

600
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:00,503
l'm sure we were together
even in our previous births

601
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:06,441
l thought of nothing,
l understood nothing...

602
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:09,107
l said not yes,
l said not no...

603
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:20,125
The way we've fallen in love,
nobody ever has

604
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:54,153
Long live! Student's Union!
Give in to our demands!

605
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:01,699
What about our demands? Since so many
days you have been putting us off.

606
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:04,596
Have you told of
our demands to the C.M.?

607
01:01:05,175 --> 01:01:07,109
l have told him everything.
l even told him that...

608
01:01:07,444 --> 01:01:10,436
your demands are valid & that
he should meet with your demands.

609
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,372
As you are all aware that the
C.M. is a hard nut to crack.

610
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:19,118
He has declined your demands.
You tell me what l can do?

611
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:21,254
You too could make this decision.

612
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:24,457
l can do nothing.
lt's not in my hands.

613
01:01:24,828 --> 01:01:26,819
Then what right have you to continue
your tenure in this office?

614
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:29,121
Why don't you just
resign and get off?

615
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:31,733
Shut up!
Who are you to give me an advice?

616
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:35,536
Now you are pushing it too far.
Go and talk to the C.M.

617
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:38,430
Take you demands directly to
him when he returns from Delhi.

618
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:41,734
lf you don't resign, then
the students will be forced to do so.

619
01:01:42,145 --> 01:01:42,873
Get lost!

620
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:44,738
Don't take the student's
to be so weak.

621
01:01:44,848 --> 01:01:46,839
We will go on a
huger strike from today onwards.

622
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:50,142
Down with Chaudhri.

623
01:01:52,155 --> 01:01:54,817
Hail to!
Student's Unity.

624
01:01:55,358 --> 01:02:00,421
Very good! Since long had l been
planning to get to that C.M.

625
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:04,430
This strike will help me make my move.
You just wait & watch.

626
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:08,534
That C.M. will himself
resign from his post.

627
01:02:09,105 --> 01:02:12,336
Looks as though you got a superb
plan cooked up in your dirty brain?

628
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:14,877
You will get
a taste of it soon enough.

629
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:17,839
But, l too have some conditions.
- Let's hear to it.

630
01:02:22,118 --> 01:02:24,450
l'll spoil the C.M.'s reputation
to such an extent that,...

631
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:27,112
he will be forced to
go back to his village.

632
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,351
But after that,...

633
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:31,256
l should reap huge profits from
the lucrative political world.

634
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:33,224
That you certainly will.

635
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:35,624
Brother...
- Oh yeah!

636
01:02:35,732 --> 01:02:37,723
l want you to get my Junior a seat
in to the legislative assembly.

637
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:39,562
You got it boss!
- And...

638
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:42,497
Say nothing more.
Just a minute!

639
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:48,133
You go inside. Hey Chaudhri.
l'm talking to you... Go inside.

640
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:58,149
lf this government changes, this
lousy fellow is just for the show.

641
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:00,422
And after that,
you shall be the Home Minister...

642
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:01,752
& l shall be the C.M.

643
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:05,084
Does that make you happy?
Now, let's hear your plan.

644
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:09,455
What's the hurry man?
Let the hunger strike begin first.

645
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,534
ln the meantime,
l've a few things to iron out,

646
01:03:12,869 --> 01:03:16,100
Meet me at my residence
after a couple of days.

647
01:03:16,506 --> 01:03:18,770
l'll then tell you what my plan is.

648
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:26,105
So, this is the thing.
- That's right, Siddhant.

649
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:28,379
Their conversations implies that...

650
01:03:28,551 --> 01:03:30,712
they are definitely plotting
something big & dangerous.

651
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:32,713
You don't worry, Anees.

652
01:03:33,123 --> 01:03:36,581
l won't let them succeed
in their devious scheme.

653
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,551
l shall keep my eye on
them right from now onwards.

654
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:41,559
That would spoil everything.

655
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:43,561
They are already on
the alert from your side.

656
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,132
They might change their
plan if they smell a rat.

657
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:48,803
And then we'd never know what's
cooking in their hell's kitchen.

658
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:51,730
What do you suggest then?
- l'll do one thing.

659
01:03:52,142 --> 01:03:55,134
l'll keep an eye on
their each & every moves.

660
01:03:56,146 --> 01:03:58,740
And, as soon as l learn of something,
l'll inform you immediately.

661
01:03:59,149 --> 01:03:59,808
Okay.

662
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:03,415
And yes. There's a meeting
at Spot Nana's residence.

663
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:08,218
Hello sister-in-law!
- Hello.

664
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:09,755
How are you?
- l'm fine.

665
01:04:10,093 --> 01:04:12,084
How about you?
- l too am fine.

666
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:15,093
But, this is not good that you
get rid of us only by cup of tea.

667
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:18,100
You are the one
who loves to drink tea.

668
01:04:18,334 --> 01:04:20,461
Well, finish you tea.
Meanwhile, l'll prepare the dinner.

669
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:23,103
Not today.
Today l'm very busy.

670
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:27,102
How about tomorrow? Let's
have dinner together tomorrow.

671
01:04:27,777 --> 01:04:30,371
Student's strike
takes on a violent form.

672
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,771
Student's anger
towards the government.

673
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:36,117
There has been many an incidents
of a rampage & riot in many places.

674
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:39,486
Many a BEST buses were
destroyed in their depots.

675
01:04:39,889 --> 01:04:41,880
Students laid themselves
on the railway tracks...

676
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:43,820
on the Dadar station & stopped
the trains from going any further.

677
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,724
The agitated crowd went on
a rampage on the station.

678
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,791
Fire was set to the booking office
& a man was killed.

679
01:04:55,305 --> 01:04:56,602
Well done Junior!

680
01:04:56,839 --> 01:04:59,603
You & your boys did a wonderful
job in these two days.

681
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:10,675
When is the C.M. coming back?
- He's coming tomorrow morning.

682
01:05:17,227 --> 01:05:20,754
Hey Nana. Groom yourself later.
First, let us hear your plan.

683
01:05:23,766 --> 01:05:27,293
Nana, my friend.
Your plan must be something.

684
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:29,695
l'm so excited to hear it.

685
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:33,437
The first thing C.M. will
want to do when he arrives...

686
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:36,101
tomorrow morning is
meet the student's leaders.

687
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:38,537
He will have a meeting with them...

688
01:05:38,781 --> 01:05:41,113
& try to put an end to this
strike somehow or the other.

689
01:05:41,517 --> 01:05:43,508
As soon as the strike ends,...

690
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:46,550
the student's leaders serve
fruit juices to the strikers.

691
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:50,115
And, he too will want to serve
the juice to the student's leaders.

692
01:05:50,793 --> 01:05:53,284
And the juice will end everything.

693
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,394
We will add poison to the juice.

694
01:05:58,368 --> 01:06:01,064
We have already spoiled
the image of the C.M.

695
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:04,065
lf the student leader
happens to die by his hands,...

696
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,238
all the student power
will go against him.

697
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:10,574
And students
means a great strength.

698
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,071
They won't let him
remain in the seat for long.

699
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:17,479
But, this job should be
carried our with precision.

700
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:20,418
lt's the job of the Home Minister
to drive the C.M....

701
01:06:20,657 --> 01:06:23,455
directly to the
strike site from the airport.

702
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:28,427
Junior, it's your job to add
poison to the juice.

703
01:06:28,698 --> 01:06:29,687
Right bro.

704
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:35,269
Whoever it is; finish him off!

705
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:17,070
Problem!
Major problem!

706
01:07:17,747 --> 01:07:20,739
Stop talking nonsense
when l'm around.

707
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:49,502
What happened to you?
- Forget me & take care of him. Go!

708
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:59,380
Siddhant, it's me Anees speaking.
- Yes... What is it?

709
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:02,049
l'm calling from Worli seaface.
My life is in danger.

710
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:04,181
ln danger!
- Listen to me.

711
01:09:04,387 --> 01:09:06,048
Go to the press &...
- To the press!

712
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:37,074
Help!

713
01:09:52,168 --> 01:09:55,433
Stop!
Please stop the car...

714
01:09:57,106 --> 01:09:59,097
Mister, could you please take
me to a nearby police station?

715
01:09:59,342 --> 01:10:01,708
Some mobsters are trying to kill me.

716
01:10:02,111 --> 01:10:05,103
Please mister!
- All right. Get in the back.

717
01:10:25,835 --> 01:10:27,735
Hey, what are you doing
here so late in the night?

718
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:30,628
Nothing sir. The headlights are not
working. l was just checking them.

719
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,734
All right. Check it quick & move on.
- Yes sir.

720
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:37,903
What happened?
- Some problem with the jeep.

721
01:10:52,828 --> 01:10:54,887
Why did you stop?
- The keys fell down.

722
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,889
Found them.

723
01:10:59,168 --> 01:11:03,104
Hey mister! l want to go to
the Worli seaface. Drop me there.

724
01:11:32,735 --> 01:11:34,896
You can come now sir.
The jeep has started.

725
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:06,257
What's that? l came to Delhi for just
a couple of days & back there,

726
01:12:06,435 --> 01:12:08,562
everything has gone haywire!
Couldn't you do anything?

727
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:10,762
What do l say now?

728
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:15,470
l tried my best to handle
the situation but, l failed.

729
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:19,274
l've therefore given you the call.
- All right then.

730
01:12:19,582 --> 01:12:22,710
l'll fly down tomorrow morning.
- Very good sir.

731
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:02,751
Why are you staring
at me like that for?

732
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:06,084
l never knew you could laugh.
- ls that so?

733
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:14,468
Brother Anees, you are the
only one who can make him laugh.

734
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:39,451
lt's too late now.
Better go to bed.

735
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:43,123
l can't sleep.
You go to bed.

736
01:13:45,134 --> 01:13:51,130
Today, brother Anees had promised
to dine together with us.

737
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:55,333
But he...

738
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:02,413
Go...
Go to bed...

739
01:14:11,627 --> 01:14:14,095
Hello Siddhant...
lt's me, Anees speaking.

740
01:14:14,697 --> 01:14:17,427
l'm calling from the Worli seaface.
My life is in danger.

741
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,432
Listen to me...
Go to the press &...

742
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:53,465
Long live! Student's Unity!
Meet our demands!

743
01:15:26,602 --> 01:15:28,900
Conspiracy against
the Chief Minister.

744
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:33,498
Our demands were
presented before many a times.

745
01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:35,507
What action did you take so far?

746
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:38,439
Your demands were never
presented before me.

747
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:42,581
l don't even know
what your demands are.

748
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:45,449
l had gone to Delhi.
- Go wherever you want.

749
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:47,612
But, what should we students do;
where should we go?

750
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:50,782
Have you ever thought about this?
Long live! Student's Unity!

751
01:15:56,131 --> 01:15:59,532
Listen... l too have gone
on a hunger strike in my youth.

752
01:16:00,135 --> 01:16:01,659
l too have shouted slogans...

753
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:07,737
to drive out the Britishers out of
this country & to achieve freedom.

754
01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:10,635
Now our country is a free country.

755
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:14,739
Then, what is the need for
this hunger strike & slogans?

756
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,550
Listen to me.
l'm like your father.

757
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,351
l've myself been a teacher once.

758
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:27,752
Trust me.
l shall do no injustice with you.

759
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,762
Have faith in me.
- All right sir.

760
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,101
Bring in the juice.

761
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:03,293
Sir... stop!

762
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:08,495
There's poison in that juice.
- Poison!

763
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:11,403
That is right sir.
Let me have that glass.

764
01:17:18,347 --> 01:17:21,077
Have you or have you not
added poison to this juice?

765
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:24,748
Tell me the truth. Haven't you added
poison to this glass of juice?

766
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:26,782
No sir.
- Then, you drink it.

767
01:17:35,898 --> 01:17:38,560
l'll tell you everything.
- Speak.

768
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:41,501
l was told by Junior;...

769
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:45,437
l mean to say, the younger
brother of Nana to do this job.

770
01:17:47,176 --> 01:17:50,771
Brother, that Kaalia from Dongri
is interfering in our business.

771
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,778
When is the exhibition?
- On the 20th.

772
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:56,714
ls he putting up a stall?
- Yes, he is.

773
01:17:57,286 --> 01:17:59,277
All right...
We will take care of him there.

774
01:18:03,192 --> 01:18:06,457
lnspector, what brings you here?
Have you come for the extortion?

775
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:08,689
Nana is not home.
Come later.

776
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,529
Hey, get down.
- What for?

777
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,228
l place you under arrest
for solicitation for murder...

778
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:16,394
by trying to poison
the student's leader...

779
01:18:16,638 --> 01:18:19,505
through C.M.'s hands & for
the murder of journalist Anees.

780
01:18:19,842 --> 01:18:23,334
Oh yeah!
He's come to arrest me.

781
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:30,416
l've committed countless murders
& nobody has ever dared to book me.

782
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:32,650
Go back to your own business.

783
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:36,685
Hey look!
l've got the joker.

784
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,762
Talk to the Home Minister.

785
01:22:11,273 --> 01:22:14,470
You arrested Junior in the student's
case & threw him in the lockup.

786
01:22:15,177 --> 01:22:17,668
Don't you know
that he is a respectable man?

787
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:21,115
He should be set free
within 10 minutes.

788
01:22:21,516 --> 01:22:23,108
Why don't you say something?

789
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:39,464
Please may l come in?

790
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:43,762
Please come inside.
- Thank you.

791
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:46,664
Sorry but l did not...
- My name is Naseem.

792
01:22:47,142 --> 01:22:49,474
l've been appointed
as a P.A. to the C.M.

793
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:54,838
l've come to congratulate you.
- To congratulate me!

794
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:58,376
That's right.
Many an officers came and went.

795
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:03,450
But, none could nail either
Nana nor his kid brother...

796
01:23:03,759 --> 01:23:05,659
because of his political connections.

797
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:11,089
But, you very bravely arrested that
hoodlum & threw him in the lockup.

798
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:15,265
Now tell me. lsn't this
deed worth complimenting?

799
01:23:16,505 --> 01:23:18,496
Many an influential
personalities of this city...

800
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:20,698
are upset with me
in this matter.

801
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:27,105
They are all cursing me.
lt's only who is complimenting me.

802
01:23:27,449 --> 01:23:29,644
l find it appropriate to
shake my hands in friendship...

803
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:31,809
where l find
honesty & sincerity.

804
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:36,852
l prefer to make friendship
where there is sincerity.

805
01:23:40,195 --> 01:23:42,857
You are...
- l'm the sister of Anees.

806
01:23:46,134 --> 01:23:48,398
He was my brother only by name.

807
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:52,396
But, he was all
the family l had got.

808
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:57,542
Till today, he's taken care of all
the responsibilities, including mine.

809
01:23:58,714 --> 01:24:03,083
And today, when l was capable
enough to share his responsibility,...

810
01:24:03,652 --> 01:24:06,348
he left me.

811
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:16,094
l swear by you...

812
01:24:17,099 --> 01:24:20,762
The man who's taken away
your brother & my friend...

813
01:24:21,403 --> 01:24:24,099
shall face a death penalty.
And, l'll see to it myself.

814
01:24:25,807 --> 01:24:28,435
Do you know who the man is whom you
locked up in the locker all night?

815
01:24:28,777 --> 01:24:31,712
Whoever he may be.
As far as l know, he's a criminal.

816
01:24:32,147 --> 01:24:34,775
What crime has he committed?
The student's leader who was...

817
01:24:35,117 --> 01:24:37,608
Excuse me sir...
- Shut up! Stand there quietly!

818
01:24:38,887 --> 01:24:42,118
on hunger strike, he tried to poison
him through the hands of the C.M.

819
01:24:42,591 --> 01:24:44,582
Have you got this
job only so that...

820
01:24:44,726 --> 01:24:49,459
you may charge innocent people with
crime & shut them up in the lockup?

821
01:24:50,365 --> 01:24:53,129
You cannot shut
an innocent man like this...

822
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:56,395
Sorry sir... How can you
guarantee that he is innocent?

823
01:24:56,705 --> 01:24:58,696
Because, the real
culprit has been nabbed.

824
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:02,476
What the...
- You heard it right.

825
01:25:03,178 --> 01:25:08,514
The person who machinated this
transgression has confessed.

826
01:25:09,084 --> 01:25:13,748
He himself came to the police
station & surrendered himself.

827
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:17,655
And at this moment, he is in there...
ln the lockup...

828
01:25:18,527 --> 01:25:21,325
Our department is there to
nab the real perpetrator...

829
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:24,624
after a thorough investigation
and careful evaluation.

830
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:27,692
Do you know that l could
even suspend you for this?

831
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:30,401
Forgive him.
He made a mistake.

832
01:25:33,108 --> 01:25:36,100
These action movies nowadays have
truly gone to the heads of the cops.

833
01:25:36,878 --> 01:25:39,369
They think of
themselves as a super hero.

834
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:44,118
Hey, better stop your movements.
l'm giving you the last warning.

835
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:49,381
What are you staring at?
Go & open up the cell.

836
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:58,390
Constable! Open the cell.
- Okay sir...

837
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:02,069
Listen sir. My brother
didn't do anything wrong.

838
01:26:02,404 --> 01:26:06,272
This stupid inspector for no
deliberately put him in prison.

839
01:26:06,741 --> 01:26:09,676
l'll be satisfied only if you spend
some of your departmental funds...

840
01:26:10,078 --> 01:26:14,071
& got this news published in
all the leading newspapers.

841
01:26:16,485 --> 01:26:18,214
Let's go Junior!

842
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:28,094
Constable... Where is that man
who has confessed to that crime?

843
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:42,275
Did you commit this crime?

844
01:26:45,247 --> 01:26:46,578
Tell me the truth.

845
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:50,444
Me & my wife hadn't had
anything to eat since so many days.

846
01:26:51,553 --> 01:26:56,115
They will give food to my wife.
l therefore am here.

847
01:26:56,525 --> 01:26:58,516
Atleast she will live.

848
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:12,335
Yes?
- Where's the match-stick?

849
01:27:14,075 --> 01:27:20,446
Men in uniforms are no less than
dogs in the eyes of the leaders.

850
01:27:21,216 --> 01:27:25,209
Why are you looking
at me like that for?

851
01:27:26,354 --> 01:27:28,584
Today you look very strange.

852
01:27:30,425 --> 01:27:32,689
How do l look?
- l don't know.

853
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:35,096
You don't know anything.

854
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:37,421
This bloody law binds us
uniformed men in so many...

855
01:27:37,699 --> 01:27:40,099
strings of restrictions that we
are refrained from doing anything.

856
01:27:42,504 --> 01:27:45,098
Our rising dreams of erasing the crime
from the surface of this planet...

857
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:48,104
is burst when it crashes
with the solid reality.

858
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:51,112
All those bestiary of monsters...

859
01:27:51,346 --> 01:27:55,112
who are a stigma on the
humanity should all be shot down.

860
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:58,112
This is the only
way to cleanse the society.

861
01:28:00,121 --> 01:28:04,615
Listen to me.
Mr. C.M. is your guru.

862
01:28:06,061 --> 01:28:08,655
Why don't you talk
to him about these people?

863
01:28:09,064 --> 01:28:11,294
What do l tell him?
What will he do?

864
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:14,063
Law relies on evidences.

865
01:28:14,235 --> 01:28:17,068
And all my incriminating
evidences have been negated.

866
01:28:17,505 --> 01:28:20,065
With non existence of any evidences,
neither he nor l can do anything.

867
01:28:22,477 --> 01:28:24,468
How will this
nation ever prosper...

868
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:26,670
if the truth will always
be strangled in this manner?

869
01:28:26,848 --> 01:28:28,748
What will ever
become of this country?

870
01:28:29,084 --> 01:28:31,075
ln order to improve the
condition of our country,...

871
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:33,344
it is really necessary for
you to spoil your health?

872
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:37,351
Please come & have your dinner.

873
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,557
A special announcement.

874
01:28:41,096 --> 01:28:43,860
To stop the anarchy
caused by communal riots,...

875
01:28:44,299 --> 01:28:47,757
the city has gone under
curfew for the next 48 hours.

876
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:51,368
Reserve police & special forces
too have been called in.

877
01:28:51,773 --> 01:28:53,764
Anyone who is seen
outside the house...

878
01:28:54,109 --> 01:28:56,771
or causing any kind of
disturbances will be arrested.

879
01:32:33,127 --> 01:32:36,858
lnspector, what you
did was not right.

880
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:44,533
What had happened over there?
Why did you shoot him?

881
01:32:44,806 --> 01:32:45,932
He broke the curfew.

882
01:32:46,241 --> 01:32:48,732
You could have arrested him
if he had broken the curfew.

883
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:52,471
There was no order of shoot at sight.
- l had gone there to arrest him.

884
01:32:53,147 --> 01:32:56,139
But, he attacked me.
He even tried to kill me.

885
01:32:56,484 --> 01:32:58,714
Have you any proof
to prove your allegations?

886
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:01,421
His finger prints are
present on the iron rod...

887
01:33:01,689 --> 01:33:03,680
that have been recovered
from the scene of the crime.

888
01:33:04,092 --> 01:33:07,084
This wound on my left arm has
been caused by that same rod.

889
01:33:07,695 --> 01:33:09,560
This is the medical report.

890
01:33:17,105 --> 01:33:19,699
Looks as though,
you were in a hurry to shoot him.

891
01:33:20,108 --> 01:33:22,099
You therefore shot him
right after he attacked you.

892
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:26,403
l first fired in the
air as a warning to him.

893
01:33:26,881 --> 01:33:29,577
And then, l shot him
in his legs to stop him.

894
01:33:30,118 --> 01:33:32,109
And then, when he still
could not be controlled,...

895
01:33:32,287 --> 01:33:34,278
under the right of
Personal Defence Act,...

896
01:33:34,455 --> 01:33:36,446
l was forced to shoot him.

897
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:38,717
Doesn't matter whatever
your reasons may be...

898
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:44,698
but the shooting of a hoodlum by
a cop in the middle of the road...

899
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:47,124
is disgraceful for our department.

900
01:33:47,635 --> 01:33:53,130
lt would had been more
disgraceful for our department...

901
01:33:53,641 --> 01:33:58,806
if a cop had been shot by a
hoodlum in the middle of the road.

902
01:34:04,085 --> 01:34:06,076
Sir, you have got
to stop that C.M....

903
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:08,345
somehow or the other
from prohibiting alcohol.

904
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:10,681
Else, we will all be ruined.

905
01:34:11,192 --> 01:34:16,824
l've tried everything, but that
stubborn man won't budge a bit.

906
01:34:18,366 --> 01:34:20,630
There's only one way left for us now.

907
01:34:21,102 --> 01:34:23,434
And that is,
to fight him face to face.

908
01:34:24,105 --> 01:34:27,097
For that, we will have to
buy about 4 to 5 Ministers...

909
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:29,806
and about 50 M.L.A.'s.

910
01:34:30,645 --> 01:34:34,103
But nowadays,
Katkar is trying to avoid me.

911
01:34:35,116 --> 01:34:37,710
l could require a
lot of cash for this job.

912
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,119
We will take care of the finance.

913
01:34:41,122 --> 01:34:43,522
Take this. This bag
contains five million rupees.

914
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:46,457
We are ready to pay
you more if the need be.

915
01:34:46,794 --> 01:34:49,126
But sir, no mater what happens,
you have got to do this job.

916
01:34:50,732 --> 01:34:52,461
Your job will be done.

917
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:55,562
You can relax &
go back to your business.

918
01:34:58,906 --> 01:35:00,464
Hello sir.

919
01:35:02,076 --> 01:35:06,342
What is it? Ministers of all
departments have come to visit me!

920
01:35:06,748 --> 01:35:08,648
There are many
who are standing outside.

921
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:12,342
Why are they standing outside?
ls there no more room inside?

922
01:35:13,087 --> 01:35:14,748
Okay.
Tell me what the matter is.

923
01:35:15,356 --> 01:35:19,656
We've already expressed our opinions
many a times before to you...

924
01:35:20,094 --> 01:35:23,086
in regard to your decision of
imposing a prohibition on alcohol.

925
01:35:23,831 --> 01:35:26,493
But you never paid
any attention to them.

926
01:35:27,335 --> 01:35:29,326
Not only me but there
are many other ministers...

927
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:31,561
who are opposing this
decision of yours.

928
01:35:32,106 --> 01:35:35,439
That is why l've brought
them all here to meet you.

929
01:35:36,444 --> 01:35:39,106
You very well know that
this is democratic country.

930
01:35:39,514 --> 01:35:42,278
The final decision should lie
in the hands of the majority.

931
01:35:43,251 --> 01:35:45,651
Now, you know
what's best to be done.

932
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,712
l've already thought about that.

933
01:35:48,122 --> 01:35:50,716
All these people too know what they
are doing & therefore they are here.

934
01:35:51,225 --> 01:35:53,557
Tell me what your opinions are.

935
01:35:54,128 --> 01:35:57,120
Sure! Go ahead & tell him
what you all think of it.

936
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:59,626
We will tell him.
We are not afraid.

937
01:35:59,901 --> 01:36:01,835
What the Home Minister says is true.

938
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:05,066
We have all received 500 thousand
rupees to vote against your decision

939
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:07,668
And all the M.L.A.'s have
received a hundred thousand rupees.

940
01:36:08,076 --> 01:36:09,668
That's right!

941
01:36:10,344 --> 01:36:13,745
Sir, this is all wrong.
They mean ill to me.

942
01:36:14,348 --> 01:36:16,077
They are all trying to set me up.

943
01:36:16,317 --> 01:36:18,683
They all pushed me forward
& themselves have stepped back.

944
01:36:19,153 --> 01:36:21,144
This is their conspiracy.
- Oh really!

945
01:36:21,522 --> 01:36:23,251
ls this really their conspiracy!

946
01:36:25,827 --> 01:36:28,421
Sir, you have got to stop that C.M
somehow or the other...

947
01:36:28,596 --> 01:36:31,087
from prohibiting alcohol.
Else, we will all be ruined.

948
01:36:31,499 --> 01:36:36,664
l've tried everything but that
stubborn man won't budge a bit.

949
01:36:37,505 --> 01:36:39,496
There's only one
way left for us now.

950
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:42,199
For that, we will have to
buy about 4 to 5 Ministers...

951
01:36:42,376 --> 01:36:44,310
and about 50 M.L.A.'s.

952
01:36:45,113 --> 01:36:47,604
Take this. This bag
contains five million rupees.

953
01:36:48,349 --> 01:36:50,715
We are ready to pay
you more if the need be.

954
01:36:51,819 --> 01:36:56,119
Problem!
Major problem!!

955
01:36:57,725 --> 01:37:02,059
A big disaster & a big loss.

956
01:37:03,131 --> 01:37:08,068
That C.M. asked you to resign from
your post & you quietly came back!

957
01:37:08,536 --> 01:37:10,731
You used to boast that you
would create a new party...

958
01:37:11,072 --> 01:37:13,666
& that you had the backing
of the majority of M.L.A.'s.

959
01:37:14,108 --> 01:37:16,235
You should have threatened him;
done something or the other.

960
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,401
Why did you ever come back quietly?

961
01:37:18,846 --> 01:37:21,406
l lost my seat but
atleast managed to save my honour.

962
01:37:22,483 --> 01:37:26,476
lf l had created a ruckus then,
that could have exposed us.

963
01:37:34,023 --> 01:37:37,584
Hey, l can control
everyone but not you.

964
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,851
How many times have
l told you not to work.

965
01:37:40,029 --> 01:37:43,089
lt's nothing like that. Moreover,
it's good to work in pregnancy.

966
01:37:43,599 --> 01:37:44,657
Doctor has said so.

967
01:37:44,867 --> 01:37:47,267
Who is that fool who's been giving
wrong advices to my dear wife?

968
01:37:47,603 --> 01:37:49,594
But,...
- Now go & lie down.

969
01:38:24,106 --> 01:38:27,564
You love me so much...

970
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:35,580
So much?

971
01:38:36,385 --> 01:38:39,980
This much...?
- No... this much!

972
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:46,589
There isn't as much water in the seas
as much as the love in my heart

973
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:49,996
How much do you love me...?

974
01:38:55,971 --> 01:38:59,270
This much...?
- No

975
01:38:59,742 --> 01:39:03,610
This much...?
- No. This much!

976
01:39:04,947 --> 01:39:09,611
There isn't as much water in the seas
as much as the love in my heart

977
01:39:40,883 --> 01:39:45,582
l have forgotten everything
else my eyes have seen

978
01:39:50,993 --> 01:39:55,987
ln love with you,
l have forgotten the world

979
01:39:56,999 --> 01:40:01,993
All l remember is that
l belong to you

980
01:40:49,852 --> 01:40:56,587
Our love has been rewarded

981
01:40:57,993 --> 01:41:02,987
A little flower will
blossom in our house

982
01:41:06,268 --> 01:41:11,001
lt's so beautiful...
so lovely

983
01:41:56,919 --> 01:41:59,353
Nana, tomorrow is the thirteenth
day after the death of Junior.

984
01:42:03,359 --> 01:42:06,988
You had promised to finish off
that lnspector by the thirteenth.

985
01:42:14,036 --> 01:42:17,972
Tell us when the job's to be done.

986
01:42:20,609 --> 01:42:23,874
No...
l won't kill him.

987
01:42:24,713 --> 01:42:28,945
l'll let him live to live in grief.

988
01:42:29,785 --> 01:42:32,549
How much
l've mourned for my brother...

989
01:42:32,955 --> 01:42:35,822
l want him to
mourn a million times more.

990
01:42:36,559 --> 01:42:38,550
l shall take care of him myself.

991
01:42:38,894 --> 01:42:43,888
Not him but something that's
more dear to him than his life.

992
01:42:44,567 --> 01:42:46,228
l shall attack his sentiments.

993
01:43:15,164 --> 01:43:18,600
Listen to me.
According to the customs,...

994
01:43:19,034 --> 01:43:21,798
the first child is born at
the girl's parental home.

995
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:28,870
My mother is no more.
You are everything to me.

996
01:43:30,546 --> 01:43:34,539
No matter how
important work you have,...

997
01:43:35,551 --> 01:43:38,042
you'll be with me at that
crucial moment, won't you?

998
01:43:38,887 --> 01:43:41,549
Silly girl!
l'm with you, am l not?

999
01:43:42,124 --> 01:43:45,287
Not right now.
At that time...

1000
01:43:45,961 --> 01:43:48,156
Yes. l'll be with you
even at that crucial moment.

1001
01:43:49,665 --> 01:43:53,328
ls that a promise?
- lt is.

1002
01:44:01,977 --> 01:44:04,172
Siddhant, it is me Sharma speaking.
- Hello sir.

1003
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,571
l've some urgent business with you.
Could you come over right now?

1004
01:44:06,682 --> 01:44:08,582
Yes sir.
l'll be right over.

1005
01:44:08,984 --> 01:44:10,849
My phone!
- That's right sir!

1006
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,111
You asked me over the phone
to immediately report to you.

1007
01:44:14,023 --> 01:44:17,982
That's strange! l called you up
& l myself am not aware of it!

1008
01:44:38,313 --> 01:44:40,304
Shanti, it is me Siddhant speaking.
- Yes...

1009
01:44:40,616 --> 01:44:42,550
Till the time l don't reach home,
open the door for no one...

1010
01:44:44,253 --> 01:44:46,721
l can't hear you.
Could you speak a bit clearly?

1011
01:44:48,557 --> 01:44:49,285
What?

1012
01:44:49,625 --> 01:44:52,890
Till the time l am not home,
don't open the door for anyone.

1013
01:44:53,562 --> 01:44:56,224
Don't open the door
till l don't reach home!

1014
01:44:56,899 --> 01:44:58,560
Wait for a sec.

1015
01:45:02,571 --> 01:45:04,163
Who is it?

1016
01:45:14,583 --> 01:45:15,845
No...

1017
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:49,540
Looks like your husband has arrived.

1018
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:52,539
That saved you today. l'll
be visiting you tomorrow again.

1019
01:50:49,651 --> 01:50:51,346
Listen to me . . .

1020
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:44,563
No, don't take me anywhere...
Keep me down on the ground...

1021
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:47,565
Right here...

1022
01:52:04,893 --> 01:52:09,728
No... Don't leave me
alone in this condition.

1023
01:52:14,369 --> 01:52:17,600
An attempt to save me now is futile.

1024
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:21,599
Save our child...

1025
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:03,914
Listen to me...
Don't be disheartened.

1026
01:53:07,589 --> 01:53:10,922
l had nothing in this world.

1027
01:53:12,294 --> 01:53:19,598
But now,
l've my husband & my child.

1028
01:53:22,604 --> 01:53:24,595
l'm so fortunate...

1029
01:53:40,822 --> 01:53:46,954
Time is stunned

1030
01:53:47,963 --> 01:53:53,959
Between joys and sorrow

1031
01:53:57,072 --> 01:54:01,975
The baby has opened its eyes...

1032
01:54:03,778 --> 01:54:09,978
and the mother has
closed hers forever

1033
01:54:12,988 --> 01:54:17,982
Whatever has the
father to offer...

1034
01:54:19,127 --> 01:54:22,995
now that his wife is dead?

1035
01:54:26,167 --> 01:54:31,935
The innocent baby
sheds tears...

1036
01:54:33,775 --> 01:54:37,939
for the one who has departed

1037
01:55:16,918 --> 01:55:18,909
Who were those people?

1038
01:55:23,258 --> 01:55:24,987
l don't know.

1039
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,851
Your wife was murdered
right before your eyes...

1040
01:55:28,096 --> 01:55:30,087
and you didn't even
see the killer's face?

1041
01:55:31,533 --> 01:55:33,125
lt was quite dark.

1042
01:55:33,535 --> 01:55:35,799
l don't know if it was dark or not.

1043
01:55:36,204 --> 01:55:38,638
But l'm sure you are
keeping me in the dark.

1044
01:55:40,809 --> 01:55:44,108
Think about this
little baby before...

1045
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:49,140
you let your emotions overrule
you & you take any false steps.

1046
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:56,553
lf something happens to you, what
will become of this motherless child?

1047
01:55:57,559 --> 01:56:00,153
Who will take care of him?

1048
01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:04,221
This is all l've to say.

1049
01:56:05,567 --> 01:56:07,558
Let's go Naseem.

1050
01:56:23,251 --> 01:56:27,847
C.M. has canceled all those forged
agreements & contract you had issued.

1051
01:56:28,523 --> 01:56:30,514
Kindly sign these documents.

1052
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:36,289
Problem!
Major problem!

1053
01:56:37,532 --> 01:56:38,863
Sign them.

1054
01:57:01,089 --> 01:57:05,924
You signed it, didn't you?
You finally signed my visa to hell.

1055
01:57:06,628 --> 01:57:08,562
Have you no shame left in you?

1056
01:57:08,963 --> 01:57:11,898
lf l had been in your place,
l'd have killed myself long back.

1057
01:57:12,567 --> 01:57:15,161
Nana, please take no offence.

1058
01:57:15,570 --> 01:57:17,561
But now,
l just can't hold myself back now.

1059
01:57:17,806 --> 01:57:21,572
Just get rid of
that Chief Minister.

1060
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:24,101
Come this side...

1061
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:28,037
Nana, just tell me...
Just tell me how much you want.

1062
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:30,914
But that C.M. should not make it.

1063
01:57:31,319 --> 01:57:34,914
l've never begged before anyone,
but today l'm breaking that rule.

1064
01:57:35,156 --> 01:57:36,919
Just name your price.

1065
01:57:37,025 --> 01:57:43,328
Before my licence is canceled,
l want the life of that C.M.

1066
01:57:43,965 --> 01:57:47,366
Shall we leave madam?
- Yes, let's go.

1067
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:51,600
l had already decided
about this before l came here.

1068
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,600
We will hit the C.M.
on the 14th of November.

1069
01:57:55,109 --> 01:58:00,103
You take care of the money
& l'll take care of C.M.

1070
01:58:00,615 --> 01:58:03,209
That is right, Siddhant. l heard
all this with my very own ears.

1071
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:05,616
Their intentions don't look good.

1072
01:58:05,954 --> 01:58:08,616
l think, they are
planning on something big.

1073
01:58:08,957 --> 01:58:11,619
Can you recognize those
people who were with Nana?

1074
01:58:13,328 --> 01:58:15,626
Tell me!
- Why are you beating us up?

1075
01:58:15,864 --> 01:58:17,855
Why are you bothering us?
- We have already told you...

1076
01:58:18,032 --> 01:58:19,624
We had gone over to the
Home Minister's residence...

1077
01:58:19,734 --> 01:58:21,167
to collect donations
for the Ganapati festival.

1078
01:58:21,269 --> 01:58:23,134
Did you really?
- Yes, we did.

1079
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:28,575
Now speak up if you know something.

1080
01:58:29,043 --> 01:58:31,170
Yes, we know it.
But, we won't reveal it to you.

1081
01:58:31,579 --> 01:58:35,310
What will you do?
Beat us up! Go ahead & beat us.

1082
01:58:39,921 --> 01:58:43,584
lf those two snitched on us,
our well laid plan will go to waste.

1083
01:58:44,092 --> 01:58:46,583
l somehow want those two out.

1084
01:58:47,262 --> 01:58:51,961
Don't worry about anything.
l want this job done perfectly.

1085
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:53,897
Tonight itself.

1086
01:58:57,205 --> 01:58:59,196
Why have the lights gone off?

1087
01:59:04,379 --> 01:59:06,609
Hey, who are you people?
Where do you think you are going?

1088
01:59:24,332 --> 01:59:26,323
Nana was quite
worried for you both.

1089
01:59:26,768 --> 01:59:28,759
Hope you didn't say
anything to that lnspector.

1090
01:59:29,237 --> 01:59:34,072
He beat us black & blue. But dare
if we breathe a word about it?

1091
01:59:34,976 --> 01:59:37,911
Afraid that you might have sung
our secret, we changed our plans.

1092
01:59:38,313 --> 01:59:40,907
Does that mean we won't be targeting
the C.M. on the 14th of November?

1093
01:59:47,589 --> 01:59:51,252
These are not
Nana's pet dogs, but my men.

1094
01:59:54,996 --> 01:59:57,590
Great!
Welcome lnspector!

1095
01:59:58,066 --> 02:00:00,261
How about a beer?
- Come with me to the police station.

1096
02:00:00,835 --> 02:00:04,601
Can't drink it at the police station.
Let's drink it up here.

1097
02:00:04,939 --> 02:00:08,067
l haven't come here to feast
with you but to lay a fist on you.

1098
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:12,111
Have you got a warrant?
- No need for that.

1099
02:00:12,614 --> 02:00:14,309
This is my personal decision.

1100
02:00:14,682 --> 02:00:17,947
How many times have you faced defeat
& yet you haven't improved a bit.

1101
02:00:18,386 --> 02:00:23,619
Take what l give you
& work for me.

1102
02:00:24,025 --> 02:00:25,822
That's best for you.

1103
02:00:26,628 --> 02:00:28,960
Else, l'll personally have
to mark you for death.

1104
02:01:47,341 --> 02:01:51,835
Brother Nana...
- l shan't leave him alive...

1105
02:01:52,747 --> 02:01:56,148
There is only one way for
me to go out of this cell.

1106
02:01:56,617 --> 02:01:59,586
Tell us what that is.
- Both of you beat me up.

1107
02:02:01,389 --> 02:02:03,254
Brother...
- What are you thinking of?

1108
02:02:03,591 --> 02:02:04,785
B E A T M E . . .

1109
02:02:19,073 --> 02:02:21,598
Mr. Nana, we are the journalists &
wants to ask you some questions.

1110
02:02:21,976 --> 02:02:22,965
Go ahead.

1111
02:02:23,077 --> 02:02:25,068
How did you get all so many
injuries in the police station?

1112
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:29,147
l didn't get these injuries in the
police station but in the lockup.

1113
02:02:29,751 --> 02:02:33,243
lnspector Siddhant
beat me up like an animal.

1114
02:02:33,654 --> 02:02:34,245
Why?

1115
02:02:34,555 --> 02:02:37,956
l only asked on what
charges had he arrested me.

1116
02:02:39,093 --> 02:02:41,561
What was my fault?

1117
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:44,826
You may take my life, but
atleast tell me what my fault is.

1118
02:02:45,333 --> 02:02:47,995
That threw him
into a fit of anger...

1119
02:02:48,569 --> 02:02:52,562
& he threw me down on the floor
& kicked me to a pulp.

1120
02:02:54,041 --> 02:02:59,570
l say, is this justifiable?
ls this what the law says?

1121
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:01,912
Jot this down too.

1122
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:05,913
l've never met another bigger
hoodlum than a policeman.

1123
02:03:06,754 --> 02:03:09,154
Police men are the
most dangerous of criminals.

1124
02:03:11,192 --> 02:03:15,993
On what charges have you arrested him?
- l didn't arrest him for any offence.

1125
02:03:16,597 --> 02:03:18,827
l've only arrested him to stop
him from committing a crime.

1126
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,594
What kind of a crime
are you talking about?

1127
02:03:22,603 --> 02:03:24,935
Sorry sir but l can't
reveal it to your just now.

1128
02:03:25,273 --> 02:03:28,106
Did you hear him?
He has arrested a man...

1129
02:03:28,543 --> 02:03:31,137
& he won't even give a reason
to his superiors for that arrest.

1130
02:03:31,546 --> 02:03:35,209
ls there a reason behind this too?
Listen to me. Enough of your fantasies

1131
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:37,547
You haven't got this job...

1132
02:03:37,685 --> 02:03:40,552
just so that you may arrest anyone
you dislike & throw them in jail.

1133
02:03:40,955 --> 02:03:43,549
You used the curfew as a cover up
to kill an innocent man.

1134
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:46,153
Now, you are again planning
to kill a respectable man!

1135
02:03:46,561 --> 02:03:49,052
Sir, he is the biggest criminal
& should be immediately suspended.

1136
02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:51,288
Sir, please don't
believe what he says.

1137
02:03:51,632 --> 02:03:54,567
He too is involved in the cabal.
He is a very mean man.

1138
02:03:54,902 --> 02:03:57,166
He has traded his soul to the
devil for a few silver shillings.

1139
02:04:00,708 --> 02:04:03,575
He has complained to me about
your attitude many a times before.

1140
02:04:04,111 --> 02:04:07,569
But, l gave you the benefit of doubt
hoping that you would improve someday.

1141
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:09,916
But now, enough is enough.

1142
02:04:10,318 --> 02:04:14,084
Now l can no longer ignore
your misconducts & mistakes.

1143
02:04:14,922 --> 02:04:17,584
Sir, atleast listen
to what l've to say...

1144
02:04:20,995 --> 02:04:24,158
We have heard enough of your nonsense.
There is no chance now.

1145
02:04:24,732 --> 02:04:27,132
We should have
suspended you long back.

1146
02:04:32,540 --> 02:04:34,201
Throw him out!

1147
02:04:35,543 --> 02:04:37,067
You have been like
this since your childhood.

1148
02:04:37,245 --> 02:04:39,076
You have always
let your emotions overrule you.

1149
02:04:39,247 --> 02:04:42,148
You yourself don't
know what you do or say.

1150
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:44,541
You lost your wife because
of your anger.

1151
02:04:45,286 --> 02:04:47,220
lt's a good thing
they suspended you.

1152
02:04:47,555 --> 02:04:49,989
Sir, please don't say that. Please
stop my suspension for a few days.

1153
02:04:50,224 --> 02:04:52,158
l'm only asking you
to spare me a few days.

1154
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,552
What will you do in those few days?
- l can do a lot. l can save you...

1155
02:04:55,963 --> 02:04:57,954
They are planning to kill you.

1156
02:05:00,234 --> 02:05:03,567
Siddhant, if my death is
to be by their hands then,...

1157
02:05:03,971 --> 02:05:06,565
not only you...
even God cannot save me.

1158
02:05:06,908 --> 02:05:08,341
Stop worrying about me.

1159
02:05:09,644 --> 02:05:12,272
Sir, why don't you try to
understand what l'm saying?

1160
02:05:13,281 --> 02:05:16,011
Son, you are not
in your right minds.

1161
02:05:16,584 --> 02:05:23,353
Do one thing. Forget about
everything & take some time off.

1162
02:05:24,659 --> 02:05:27,526
Sir, l...
- What l'm saying is for your own good

1163
02:05:27,862 --> 02:05:29,193
Driver, let's go.

1164
02:05:37,605 --> 02:05:39,539
No need to roll out in laughter.

1165
02:05:40,708 --> 02:05:42,869
Suspending that lnspector...

1166
02:05:43,244 --> 02:05:46,236
has proven more bad
than beneficial to us.

1167
02:05:47,114 --> 02:05:49,981
Now he is much
more dangerous because,...

1168
02:05:50,551 --> 02:05:52,883
he is no longer
bound by the law.

1169
02:05:53,287 --> 02:05:56,950
Problem!
Major problem!!

1170
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:04,256
Therefore before he strikes,
we have to make our move.

1171
02:06:04,966 --> 02:06:08,902
Let's prey on him first before
we make the C.M. our target.

1172
02:06:47,742 --> 02:06:50,540
You stood up to challenge us,
didn't you?

1173
02:06:51,612 --> 02:06:54,547
Well, where did all that
enthusiasm vanish off to?

1174
02:06:56,650 --> 02:07:00,108
Tell me now... Who else
have you told of our plan?

1175
02:07:02,056 --> 02:07:04,547
l've no need to tell anyone.

1176
02:07:05,159 --> 02:07:10,563
l alone am enough to tackle
with you all & send you to hell.

1177
02:07:11,065 --> 02:07:14,557
And, that's a promise.
- Only if you live.

1178
02:07:25,046 --> 02:07:27,037
This is Nana's torture chamber.

1179
02:07:27,648 --> 02:07:32,585
Not like one of your precinct's
where you let the man walk out alive.

1180
02:07:54,008 --> 02:07:57,000
Remember how you
had killed my brother?

1181
02:07:59,747 --> 02:08:04,616
Remember how you beat me up all
the way & dragged me to the station?

1182
02:08:14,695 --> 02:08:16,128
Damn him!

1183
02:08:21,368 --> 02:08:24,633
This is the same school where
l've marked the C.M. for death.

1184
02:08:25,339 --> 02:08:27,273
Tomorrow morning on
the 14th of November,...

1185
02:08:27,575 --> 02:08:29,873
this entire area will
be under my control.

1186
02:08:30,277 --> 02:08:33,269
According to the arrangements, the C.M.
will enter the premises from here.

1187
02:08:33,848 --> 02:08:36,840
He will walk through the
crowd of children to the stage.

1188
02:08:37,184 --> 02:08:38,913
This is the stage.

1189
02:08:39,086 --> 02:08:41,577
But before that, all of us will
already be present over here.

1190
02:08:41,989 --> 02:08:44,253
l'll have a bouquet containing
a cheque of Rs. 500,000...

1191
02:08:44,592 --> 02:08:48,119
delivered to the C.M.
by a child's hands.

1192
02:08:48,696 --> 02:08:50,960
That bouquet will contain a bomb.

1193
02:08:51,765 --> 02:08:54,757
That kid will take
a minute to reach the C.M.

1194
02:08:55,603 --> 02:08:58,595
As soon as the kid will hand
over the bouquet to the C.M.,...

1195
02:08:59,206 --> 02:09:01,003
the bomb will go off.

1196
02:09:05,012 --> 02:09:07,173
Wasn't that C.M.
a school master once?

1197
02:09:07,615 --> 02:09:09,879
Will look good if he
died in the school grounds.

1198
02:09:10,217 --> 02:09:12,208
That will surely
rest his soul in peace.

1199
02:09:13,787 --> 02:09:16,620
Chaudhri, make sure that he
doesn't suspect anything...

1200
02:09:16,924 --> 02:09:19,620
& it'll be your responsibility to
bring him directly to the school.

1201
02:09:23,297 --> 02:09:25,993
All your security personnel
will do as l say.

1202
02:09:26,333 --> 02:09:27,265
All right.

1203
02:09:27,635 --> 02:09:32,572
Katkar, you will bear the entire
cost spent on this project.

1204
02:09:34,308 --> 02:09:37,835
The C.M. will die at
exactly 5:35 p.m. tomorrow.

1205
02:09:38,879 --> 02:09:42,007
And at exactly 6:00, Chaudhari will
take the oath of the Chief Minister.

1206
02:09:44,818 --> 02:09:49,255
We will spread the rumour that
Siddhant did all this in insanity.

1207
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:55,929
And then, we'll have him shot down
like a mad dog in a police encounter.

1208
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:01,200
Hello sir!
- Hello!

1209
02:10:07,608 --> 02:10:11,271
Hello sir!
- Chaudhri, what brings you here?

1210
02:10:12,379 --> 02:10:16,213
Sir, please forgive me.

1211
02:10:17,918 --> 02:10:22,355
My greed to stay put in the assembly
made me forget all my duties.

1212
02:10:24,124 --> 02:10:27,890
My parents have
earned glory in politics.

1213
02:10:28,963 --> 02:10:32,228
But, l ruined my good name.

1214
02:10:33,567 --> 02:10:35,159
l want nothing.

1215
02:10:35,569 --> 02:10:39,164
All l ask of you is to forgive
me as one of your students...

1216
02:10:39,573 --> 02:10:43,100
so that l may go back
to my native place in peace.

1217
02:10:43,978 --> 02:10:46,242
l'll bid farewell
to politics for ever.

1218
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:49,140
Chaudhri, what's this?
Why are you crying like a baby?

1219
02:10:49,650 --> 02:10:53,848
l want to see a change in
a man & not to see him bad.

1220
02:10:54,655 --> 02:10:59,752
Sir, you are so noble hearted!
- lt's all right!

1221
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:22,933
l bless all the
children gathered here...

1222
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:26,103
on this auspicious occasion
of the Children's day.

1223
02:13:27,141 --> 02:13:29,541
lt is my good fortune that...

1224
02:13:29,877 --> 02:13:31,708
l'm present today...

1225
02:13:31,945 --> 02:13:36,882
amongst so many smiling faces
of all these little angels.

1226
02:13:38,152 --> 02:13:41,553
Children, l've but only one wish...

1227
02:13:42,890 --> 02:13:45,882
that you all pay
attention to your studies...

1228
02:13:46,994 --> 02:13:51,988
& grow up to be a gentleman
& bring glory to your nation.

1229
02:13:58,906 --> 02:14:02,569
Sir, l'm an illiterate man.
l know not how to speak.

1230
02:14:02,976 --> 02:14:04,568
Me & my friend...

1231
02:14:04,711 --> 02:14:07,236
has collected five hundred thousand
rupees for these children.

1232
02:14:07,648 --> 02:14:11,744
l'd like to donate this cheque to
these children by your noble hands.

1233
02:14:13,854 --> 02:14:15,719
Why not?
You are most welcome.

1234
02:14:15,923 --> 02:14:17,254
Thank you sir.

1235
02:14:28,202 --> 02:14:31,035
Son, go & present
this bouquet to the C.M.

1236
02:15:18,986 --> 02:15:20,317
No...

1237
02:15:22,923 --> 02:15:24,254
My master...

1238
02:15:27,261 --> 02:15:30,526
Do not touch the bouquet...

1239
02:16:17,778 --> 02:16:20,269
Hey Nana, didn't you place
the bomb in the bouquet?

1240
02:16:20,747 --> 02:16:24,148
l suspected something.
l therefore changed the spot.

1241
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:31,186
Siddhant, what are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

1242
02:16:31,758 --> 02:16:33,851
These people have
plotted to kill you today.

1243
02:16:34,027 --> 02:16:36,325
There must be a bomb around.
Please go away from this place.

1244
02:16:37,764 --> 02:16:41,200
There's a limit to everything.
You are acting like a mad man.

1245
02:16:41,735 --> 02:16:44,135
Go away from here.
- Please believe me!

1246
02:16:44,538 --> 02:16:47,530
l've heard enough.
You are not in your right minds.

1247
02:16:48,041 --> 02:16:49,975
Officer, take him away!

1248
02:16:50,210 --> 02:16:53,543
Sir, l'm not mad.
l'm your student...

1249
02:16:53,981 --> 02:16:57,542
Please believe me!
Sir, l'm not crazy!

1250
02:16:59,553 --> 02:17:02,147
They mean to kill you.
l'm telling you the truth!

1251
02:17:02,723 --> 02:17:04,953
They have hidden
a bomb around here somewhere.

1252
02:17:05,325 --> 02:17:07,885
Please go away from here at once!

1253
02:17:08,629 --> 02:17:11,962
l beg of you...
Sir, they will kill you...

1254
02:17:32,753 --> 02:17:37,588
You have once again proven
that you can't hurt us.

1255
02:17:38,258 --> 02:17:43,025
You are a mad man to everyone.
Nobody will believe you.

1256
02:17:44,865 --> 02:17:48,096
Even you know that today
we are going to kill the C.M.

1257
02:17:48,935 --> 02:17:52,928
But what you don't know is how?
Only we know of it.

1258
02:17:54,708 --> 02:17:58,610
Hadn't you said once that you
can even give your life for him?

1259
02:17:59,012 --> 02:18:02,607
ln a short while from now,
you will witness him dying.

1260
02:18:05,318 --> 02:18:09,948
After the death of that old man,
you are next in my list.

1261
02:18:14,828 --> 02:18:17,296
Damn you! You were just
an ordinary sub-inspector...

1262
02:18:17,698 --> 02:18:20,223
& what not you did
for big people like us.

1263
02:18:20,901 --> 02:18:24,632
You made us tick like a toy...
You gave us sleepless nights...

1264
02:18:25,038 --> 02:18:28,565
You ruined our business.
You have done so much for us.

1265
02:18:28,942 --> 02:18:30,933
And now, we too
should do something for you.

1266
02:18:31,178 --> 02:18:34,579
We should give you a present.
Tell us what you want.

1267
02:18:56,937 --> 02:18:58,928
And now,
our Chief Minister...

1268
02:18:59,606 --> 02:19:02,598
will light the
torch to begin the games.

1269
02:21:05,599 --> 02:21:07,066
Master...

1270
02:23:13,727 --> 02:23:16,594
You are a murderer!
- That's right! l'm a murderer.

1271
02:23:16,997 --> 02:23:20,990
But, l've killed only those
who were themselves murderers.

1272
02:23:22,202 --> 02:23:24,932
What did you get after
killing all these people...

1273
02:23:25,171 --> 02:23:27,105
& turning this
temple into a graveyard?

1274
02:23:27,607 --> 02:23:29,939
l've managed to save my Guru.

1275
02:23:30,543 --> 02:23:33,876
Enough of your nonsense!
l don't believe a word you speak.

1276
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:36,214
You are lying!
- No sir.

1277
02:23:36,616 --> 02:23:39,710
l'm your student.
l'll never lie to you.

1278
02:23:44,557 --> 02:23:46,718
l'll prove it to you.

1279
02:24:54,661 --> 02:24:59,223
You sacrificed your youth just
to save an old man like me!

1280
02:25:00,233 --> 02:25:02,098
Why did you do this?

1281
02:25:12,879 --> 02:25:18,283
All your life you made mistakes
& kept on apologizing to me.

1282
02:25:19,819 --> 02:25:23,152
And today, when l've
made such a grave mistake...

1283
02:25:24,791 --> 02:25:27,521
l can't even
apologize to you.

1284
02:25:49,549 --> 02:25:54,543
Sir, promise me...

1285
02:25:55,021 --> 02:25:56,545
What is it?

1286
02:25:56,823 --> 02:26:01,556
Promise me that you will make my
son into an honest Police officer.

1287
02:26:02,562 --> 02:26:04,962
You will, won't you?...
