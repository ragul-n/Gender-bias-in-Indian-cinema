1! 2! 3!

3
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,299
Hello.

4
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,134
Okay.

5
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,970
Shaina from Mumbai. - Let her hold.

6
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,060
Kill her.

7
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,313
Yes! Give me.

8
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,151
Don Gani.. - Yes, Shaina, tell me.

9
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,196
Don Gani, l was trying to contact you.
- Yes, go ahead.

10
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:21,659
Golden has been murdered
and there is a blood bath happening here.

11
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,161
You guys don't do anything.

12
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,413
l'm coming to Mumbai
the day after tomorrow.

13
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,266
Tony here. Gani is coming to Mumbai
the day after tomorrow.

14
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,684
Confirmed?

15
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,269
Hundred per cent.

16
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,222
'To rein in the crime in Mumbai..'

17
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,224
'..the government has roped in the lG of
Punjab police..'

18
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,226
'..Mr. Ashraf Taufiq Khan
and appointed him..'

19
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,645
'..the new police commissioner of Mumbai.'

20
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,148
'He will hold a meeting with top
police officials today.'

21
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,237
Who is this Golden?

22
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,406
He's a big name in Mumbai underworld.

23
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,576
Two third of Mumbai is controlled by
Golden and his gang.

24
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,579
Kidnapping, contract killing,
extortion, land grabbing.

25
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,289
This is what the gang does.

26
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:55,086
This gang is run by a person called Gani,
not Golden.

27
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,254
He operates this gang from outside lndia.

28
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,006
Don Gani. - Yes, tell me.

29
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,299
Your job will be done.

30
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,010
We got information from the
intelligence report..

31
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,304
..that in the terrorist attack on
Mumbai last week..

32
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,266
..Gani used his local gang to help
the terrorists..

33
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,310
..come via the sea route.

34
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,938
He never stays in the country
for too long.

35
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,940
That's why he has not been
caught till now.

36
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,358
And who is Datta Pawale?

37
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,277
Datta Pawale used to be work for Gani.

38
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,196
Tie him to a rock and throw him in.

39
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,614
He built his own gang.

40
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,033
He does the same kind of work as
Golden's gang.

41
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,618
But on a smaller scale.

42
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,286
His right hand's name is Shiva.

43
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,123
He operates in the area around Versova.

44
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,875
Every other day there's a gang war
between them.

45
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,336
Some from the police department are
hand-in-glove with them.

46
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,548
And both gangs have political support.

47
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,301
We arrest them in the morning.
But they get released by evening.

48
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,970
Come on. Get in.

49
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,307
Unless we finish the Mumbai underworld
and these local gangs..

50
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:54,353
..this city can't be safe from
foreign terrorists.

51
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,149
'The moment Ashraf Khan took charge..'

52
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,735
'..he started operations against
the mafia.'

53
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,321
'ln the past 48 hours
more than 200 goons have been arrested..'

54
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:08,242
'..and eight dangerous goons
have been shot dead.'

55
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,329
'Because of Commissioner Ashraf's
tough stand..'

56
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,917
'..against the Mumbai underworld,
the gangsters are really frightened.'

57
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:22,757
'Ashraf Khan says it's his dream
to make Mumbai crime free.'

58
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,342
'And to do this, he will
not worry about..'

59
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,179
'..political or bureaucratic pressure.'

60
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,193
We have to take care of a man. - Who?

61
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,445
Genghis. - The one from Ghatkopar? - Yes.

62
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,405
We have to beat him up in his locality.

63
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,282
Money.

64
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,868
Which one of you will beat him up?

65
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,953
Radhe.

66
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,414
"He's wanted."

67
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,626
ls he any good?

68
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,629
He's more ruthless than Rambo.

69
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,797
More destructive than Terminator.

70
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,216
Smarter than Rocky and
Quicker than Bruce Lee.

71
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,634
He's the last action hero.

72
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:11,889
Stop!

73
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:19,146
Nab him!

74
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,568
You scoundrel! Stop there! - Stop!

75
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,108
"He's wanted."

76
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,110
The stuff is here brother.

77
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,113
They are just too many.
Go get some more money.

78
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,490
Okay. Excuse me.

79
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:12,950
Move aside.

80
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,287
Hey! Who are you?

81
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,788
You won't get beaten up
without knowing my name?

82
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,498
So you've taken the contract to
beat me up?

83
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:24,545
Once l take a contract,
l don't listen to myself even.

84
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,969
You fool.
Can't you see how many men are with me?

85
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,305
Pigs always hunt in groups.

86
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,308
And a tiger hunts alone.

87
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,517
Shankar, pull down the shutters.

88
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,729
Brother.. Keep it slightly open.

89
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,147
He might find it useful while escaping.

90
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,523
Stop!

91
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,816
Move aside!

92
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,156
You'll die today.

93
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,163
You've made a big mistake by throwing
away the key.

94
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,999
Hey, what will you do? What?

95
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,334
l swear on your mother.

96
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,921
Today, you won't be able to crawl out of
here, let alone walk out.

97
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,756
You're swearing on my mother?

98
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,508
Now that l've sworn on her..
- You swore on my mother..

99
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,344
l'll keep it. - You..

100
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,442
Brother.

101
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,652
l'll break the lock as well as your jaw.

102
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,198
No! No!

103
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,146

104
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,238
"l want the magic."

105
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,741
"Here and there."

106
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,708
"One. Two. Three. Four."

107
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,169
"Break it down."

108
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,507
"Here and there."

109
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,343

""With the rhythm and the beats."

"So high."

117
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,540
"This is my charisma."

118
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,793
"Do the rock and roll some night".

"Charisma.."

125
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,765
"Just magic."

126
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:09,663
"l don't know to go back on my word."

127
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,251
"Friends, it's a promise l'll die

128
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,005
"l have a unique way of living."

129
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,759

Will you work for me?

"lf you're courageous like me,

144
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,874
"Be it a storm or a hurricane."

00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:40,587

"Do the rock and roll."

161
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:40,981
"Come on, do your magic."

162
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,321
Hello, tell me..

163
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,658
Hey, stupid. Why did you disturb me?

164
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,494
Prabhudheva and Govinda had
joined me in celebrations.

165
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,662
Blasted them.

166
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:58,999
Sir, please check your iPod.

167
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,001
l'll be right back.

168
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,586
Where are you going?

169
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:04,963
l'm going to meet my cousin.

170
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,969
She lives in the neighbourhood.

171
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,429
She's throwing me glances.

172
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,183
What kind of a girl will be
interested in you.

173
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,268
She's a cat. - Really?

174
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,188
Someone like me won't get a
Miss World or Miss Universe.

175
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,523
l have only one principle.

176
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,525
Try to woo the least
beautiful girl in the group.

177
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,985
She gets enticed quickly.

178
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,446
And she won't betray you in love.

179
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,991
You fool. lf you run after the girl..

..the girl will take your money and run.

181

lf you chase money,
the girl will chase you.

182
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,874
Excuse me!

183
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,002
l don't agree with you.

184
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,464
Don't look at my face. Look in my eyes.

185
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,720
There's so much truth in them.

186
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:59,059
Your eyes express
what your heart wants to say.

187
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,227
Right.

188
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,025

You love me, too, don't you?

193
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,911
Then, why don't you express it?

194
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,246
l'm scared.

195
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,833
You're in love. Don't get scared.

196
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:28,672
"When you're in love why get scared?"

197
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,006
"You've loved, it's no.."

198
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,174
That was superb!

199
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,009
'Thank you. lf you record a

201
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,346
'..he'll be crazy about you.'

202
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,514

Who was the girl on TV?

She's a customer. - Oh, really?

207
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,442
Yes, sir. Her handycam was not working.

208
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,277
The cassette got stuck.
So we were just checking it out.

Okay. Go on.

"When you're in love, why get scared?"
-Radhe! Radhe!

218

No phone call. No message.

227

Do you think this is a guesthouse?

228
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,270
You come and leave whenever you feel like.
Get up!

229
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,779
Don't look at girls. Okay? - Absolutely.

230
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:38,176
"When you're in love why get scared?"

231
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,888
"We're in love and are not thieves."

232
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,724
"Why to sigh in solitude?"

233
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,812
"When you're in love why get scared?"

Excuse me, sir. - Yes.

237
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,989

Girls like these, do things like

Check if he has gone.

251

lt's my first day on duty, sir.

Why do you want to be a policeman?

259
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,319
For money?
- No, sir. l want to serve my country.

260
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,489

l don't know, sir.

273

The rifle we are given during training
is brand new.

274
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,535
The barrel is straight and so is the body,
isn't it?

275
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,329
And the service weapon that we get..

276
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,332
..is like some old used junk.

277
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,626
The barrel is not straight and
the body is quite loose.

278
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,296
The bullet is released,
but we miss the target.

279
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,464
Do you understand?

280
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,551

at point blank range..

281
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,303

00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,404
A local goon has been troubling me.

00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,241
He tells me to either give him
protection money or stop the work.

l told him to give me Rs.1 million
or else l'll finish him.

294
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:03,673
You're behaving like a beggar.

295
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,342
Tell him to pay up Rs.2.5 million
or else you'll finish him.

296

Aunt!

303

00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:03,483
'And your cute muscles have

'All the girls in the colony are

316
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:14,244
'For God's sake, don't lose your heart
to anyone else but me.'

317
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,455
'l can't sleep at night..' - Enough!

318
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,251
Just imagine,

Only 16.

lf she were of Jahnvi's age,
l would have considered it.

323
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,430
Janu. Janu!

Come on, brother. - Come on.

353
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:14,239
Sit down. - Why did he ask him to sit?

354
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,284
People are scared even to look at my men.

355
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,786
But you beat them up. - Hang on.

356
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,706
Yes, Brother.

357
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,293
They don't steal footwear from a mosque.

358
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,003
The one who needs them takes them away.

359
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,632
lt's your footwear that's been stolen,
not the Kohinoor diamond.

360
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,467
Go buy another pair from the market.

361
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,805
Do you know why you're still alive?

362
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,142
What? You couldn't get pilaf?

363
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,561
Do one thing. Get chicken from the market.

364
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:49,482
Bring some rice.
Add water in a pan and prepare the pilaf.

365
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,733
Cool.

366
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:56,739
Will you work for me?

367
00:26:56,824 --> 00:27:00,076
No. l only work for Gandhi.

368
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:04,497
Gandhi? Who is this don?
- Shut up. He's talking about money.

369
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,667
Stop doing odd jobs from today.

370
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,420
You got to follow two rules
if you want to work with me.

371
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,672
First. Don't mess with the police.

372
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,216
And second. Never be afraid of death.

373
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,510
The one who talks about the police is
actually afraid of them.

374
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,639
This is your right hand man?

375
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:24,517
Hey! - Stop!

376
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,648
l punched your goon in your own den.

377
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,276
This was in reply to your second
requirement.

378
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,655
Don't grab me by my collar again.

379
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,869
l'll do any job that you want.

380
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,787
But l should get half the share.

381
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,959
Hey, hero. You have a great style.

382
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:53,004
Sister,
are you here to make them your brothers?

383
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,132
Don't worry. l won't make you my brother.

384
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,724
My name is Shayana.

385
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,737
You play well with the weapon.

386
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,906
l'm a good at shooting also.

387
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,752
He's a resourceful man,
but he's too smart.

388
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,840
it's just your mouth that's
bleeding right now.

389
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,550
Just imagine what will happen later.

390
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,271
Hey stop, stop. Stop! Stop you, idiot.

391
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,024
Wait here.

392
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,239
You loafers,
your father is getting married? Move on.

393
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,407
Don't you have a college to go to?

394
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,325
Oops! Sorry.

395
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,286
Where are you going?

396
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,454
Who are you?

397
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,623
Police.

398
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,918
We're checking everyone. Clean up.

399
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:16,546
What's your name?

400
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,048
Jahnvi.

401
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,216
What do you do?

402
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,801
l work at a call centre.

403
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,139
Which call centre? - GCS.

404
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,891
Be careful. Careful.

405
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,519
Where are you going now?

406
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,979
Fitness centre.

407
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,648
You are pretty fit.
There is no need to go there.

408
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,151
Want to go to the police station? - No.

409
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,029
Will you come? - Excuse me!

410
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,075
Write down your address. - Why?

411
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,827
Will you write here or at the
police station?

412
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,082
Write down your phone number as well.

413
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,680
She's like cocaine.

414
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,060
Hey, take me to the guest house,
not the police station.

415
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,775
Who is this guy you're going to kill?

416
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,027
One of Datta Pawale's men.

417
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,528

Tell me as soon as you see him.

This is your jurisdiction.
And you're asking me what happened.

But sir, l'll be late.

Sir, don't hit me.

Sir, l was just returning from a movie.
He stopped me.

They have the support of that
scoundrel MLA Yadav.

00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,874
He is Gani's stooge.

469

Nobody is good in the world except me.

488
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,949
Oh, priest, please bless me.

489
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,952
Sweetheart..

490
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,122
She's not looking at me.

00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,112
The queue is pretty long sir.
lt will take too much time.

510
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,864
You please start the treatment.
- What if there's a long queue?

511
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,033
Don't you understand?
This is the hospital rule.

512
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,201
lt's mandatory.

513
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,619

528
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,325
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

529
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,791
Thanks.

530
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,005
Why did you have to get violent to
get me treated?

531
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,423
The results are in front of you.

532
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,676
Why did that man try to kill you?

533
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,220
l must have beaten him up.
He was only taking revenge.

534
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,264
What do you do anyway?

535
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,517
She's asking such a direct question.

536
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,103
What do you think?

537
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:17,026
l think you're a hoo.. - A hooligan?

538
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,362
Correct.

539
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,365
Why don't you work somewhere
to earn money?

540
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,285
Mother Teresa, who says
l don't earn money?

541
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,287
l can do anything for money.

542
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:29,705
What do you mean?

543
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,291
l beat up the doctor, didn't l? - Yes.

544
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,376
l take money for such things.

545
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,128
But why?

546
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,504
That's my talent.

547
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,131
People get scared of me.

548
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,674
Self-employment.

549
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,509
Self..

550
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,136
You're wondering whether
l'm a good person or a bad one.

551
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,640
No. no. - No?

552
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:51,727
Gabbar Singh.

553
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,979
Shall we go, Sambha? - Yes!

554
00:37:58,485 --> 00:37:59,568
Where do you want to go, sir?

555
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,070
Let's go.

556
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,074
How did you call the taxi?
- l whistled. Why?

557
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,326
How? - Don't you know how to whistle?

558
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,744
No.

559
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,329
Bring out your tongue a little.

560
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,167
Bring it out. Come on.

561
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:18,837
A little more.

562
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,049
Now bend it like Beckham.

563
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,150
Great whistle!

564
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:27,489
"Oh, my darling,
l can do anything for your love."

565
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:31,243
"l can fight the world for you."

566
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,080
"How do l believe you'll do
everything for me?"

567
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:38,083
"Who knows? You'll dump me anytime."

568
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:52,848
"l love you, darling.
l can give my life for you as well."

569
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,268
"Take away my heart. Baby, become mine."

570
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:57,978
"ln return, give me your heart."

571
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,565
"Listen to me, baby."

572
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,192
"You're young."

573
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,778
"Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Listen to me."

574
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,071
"Let's go party."

575
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,456
"l've taken lessons in love."

576
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:21,043
"l'll run on the path of love."

577
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,546
"Go away. Don't boast so much."

578
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,633
"Don't teach me about love."

579
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,134
"All day.. - Go away."

580
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,220
"l'll chase you.. - Go away."

581
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,431
"l'll drag you to court."

582
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:48,946
"ln your love,
l can sing the melody backwards."

583
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,407
"l'll perform fire rituals to win
you over."

584
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:56,161
"How do l believe
you'll do everything for me?"

585
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,414
"Who knows? You'll dump me anytime."

586
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:14,054
"l love you, darling.
l can give my life for you as well."

587
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:35,159
"Darling, don't make me suffer so much."

588
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:38,620
"You have my head, you may behead me."

589
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:42,291
"Don't talk so much about love."

590
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,627
"Go away.
Stop chasing me. Finish the matter."

591
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,212
"Why do you break my heart? - Go away."

592
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:49,089
"Why are you upset? - Go away."

593
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,301
"Why do you want to fall in love with me?"

594
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:56,180
"lf l make a mistake,
l'll accept any punishment."

595
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,690
"lf l make a mistake,
l'll do the sit-ups."

596
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:10,235
"l'll accept the punishment
and then steal your heart."

597
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,114
"How do l believe
you'll do everything for me?"

598
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:17,075
"Who knows? You'll dump me anytime."

599
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:32,424
"l love you, darling.
l can give my life for you as well."

600
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,931
"Come on."

601
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,565
Hey, get up!

602
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,569
Search the house. - Yes, sir.

603
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,324
What's going on?

604
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:01,286
Raid.

605
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:11,463
We've got information
that this is a house of ill repute.

606
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:15,717
Do you understand?

607
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,598
What are you doing? This is my house.

608
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,142
You've been mistaken. This..

609
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,479
l've been mistaken?

610
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,481
l?

611
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,068
Hey, come here.

612
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,656
Who is she? - My sister.

613
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,824
Who all live here?

614
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,742
Me, my mother and my sister.

615
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:41,910
And your father?

616
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,620
My father is no more.

617
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,914
Who comes here everyday? - No one.

618
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,333
Then who is that peeping tom?

619
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,960
He is the landlord.

620
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,629
Whenever he comes here,
he troubles us. Just like you.

621
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,677
Come to the other room.
l want to talk to you.

622
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,826
l'm saddened by your condition.

623
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,704
lt must have been difficult
to raise the kids, right?

624
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,872
How do you run the house?

625
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,665
My daughter goes to work.

626
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,125
Where is she?

627
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,293
She hasn't returned yet.

628
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,421
She works the nights?

629
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,467
No. No.

630
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,137
Hey, don't cry. Please.

631
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,682
l can understand your feelings.

632
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,935
You have a young daughter.

633
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,688
You must be worried thinking
how you'd get her married.

634
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,399
Don't worry.

635
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,735
l'll keep her.

636
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,529
She's amazing.

637
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,822
Hey, please.

638
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,449
l'll take care of you too.

639
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,202
You're fine even at your age.

640
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,414
The ruin says it was beautiful once.

641
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:13,919
Think about it, Laxmi.

642
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,671
lf there's a policeman in the house..

643
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:19,174
..will anyone dare misbehave with you?

644
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,762
Or else the same drug case
or a prostitution case.

645
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,433
Can your family endure so much bad name?

646
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,479
l know you'll take the right decision.

647
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:45,242
Great escape.

648
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,576
Thank you.

649
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,330
Are you the uncle who lives here?

650
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:54,626
l'm not your uncle.
l'm Sonu Gates. Software Engineer.

651
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,338
You're Jahnvi's watchman from today.

652
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,715
Call me and inform me about..

653
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,427
..who comes here, who meets her, etc.

654
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,762
Do you understand? - l understand, sir.

655
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:07,889
l got it.

656
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:13,812
Hey, come here!

657
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,814
Why are you gossiping over there?

658
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,816
Take the order quickly,
or else l'll cut your wages.

659
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,484
Go on!

660
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:20,652
Who is Ganesh?

661
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,987
That's me. Why?

662
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:23,905
And who is she?

663
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:26,241
Who is she?

664
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:31,496
As soon as you got married,
you abandoned your mother?

665
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,081
Mother! Mother!

666
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:39,254
lf you do this again, l'll break your jaw.

667
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,844
Radhe, my father. My father.

668
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,263
What's going on?

669
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:49,681
And what are you doing here?

670
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,933
l had come to meet my friend.

671
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,226
They are your friends?

672
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,858
They are my friends.

673
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,862
So, Ganesh, take care of your mother.

674
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,030
We'll move.

675
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,949
Did you understand?

676
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,208
Why were they beating you up?

677
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,044
They are my childhood friends.

678
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:22,255
They beat me up every time they meet me.

679
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,007
Yes, l saw that.

680
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,092
l saw who was beating whom.

681
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,011
Serve a cold drink to this gentleman.

682
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:36,853
Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Sweetheart!

683
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,149
Yes!

684
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,859
Talk to your dad.
He appears out of thin air.

685
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:48,907
With age everything.. - Rots.

686
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,242
But your dad is troubling us.

687
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,004
Hi.

688
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,676
Shopping?

689
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:10,679
You? - Warning.

690
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,015
Warning?

691
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:15,892
Sweetheart! - Mister! - What?

692
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,270
l wanted to return your Rs.10000.

693
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,188
Rs.10000? When did l give it to you?

694
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,024
You're not Mr. Naren. - You're not? Sorry.

695
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:26,945
Sweetheart!

696
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,283
Do anything you can.
The lift should stop. - Okay.

697
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,955
The job's done? - lt's done.

698
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,457
Sweetheart! Open the door.

699
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,794
What happened? - Hold on.

700
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:44,796
Why did the lift stop?

701
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,047
lt will take 10 to 15 minutes.

702
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,966
Have fun, man.

703
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,468
What? An hour?

704
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,636
One hour?

705
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:52,804
lt will take an hour?

706
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,681
l got it.

707
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,182
lt will take an hour now.

708
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,560
What happened? - Listen.

709
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,687
l hope you've had food. - Yes.

710
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,063
Have you been to the washroom?

711
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:03,690
Why?

712
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,984
Because you'll get none of it here.

713
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,402
lt will take an hour.

714
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:09,821
An hour?

715
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,782
We can die of suffocation in an hour.

716
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:15,827
lt's a good thing that you'll die young.

717
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,413
Or else afterwards..

718
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:24,669
..old age, overweight, grey hair.

719
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,589
Artificial dentures, wrinkles.

720
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:31,635
And this heavy make-up
to hide those wrinkles.

721
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,013
Hello. Apart from lipstick,
l don't use anything else.

722
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:39,434
What's this?

723
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,104
Mechanic, the lift is not working.
Come, quickly.

724
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,272
Give him to me.

725
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,567
Come quickly.
But the lift shouldn't start soon. - Yes.

726
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,785
Can l ask you a question?

727
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,623
Shoot.
- What's the name of your girlfriend?

728
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,042
l don't have a girlfriend.

729
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,045
Do you have a boyfriend?

730
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:11,549
Haven't found someone
who l could call my boyfriend.

731
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,219
What do you want in a boyfriend?

732
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:17,555
The guy should be well-educated.

733
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,059
He should have a great job.

734
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,063
He should be a good human being.

735
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:29,609
Handsome.. l won't mind if he's not.

736
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:35,073
That's the only quality l have.
And there is no requirement for it.

737
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,075
Did you say something? - Best of luck.

738
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,081
Check what the problem is.

739
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,085
What kind of a girl do you like?

740
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,046
l could do with any kind of girl. - Wow!

741
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,758
But they have their own long lists.
And l don't fit any of them.

742
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,094
l hate girls.

743
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,305
Sometimes l feel l should have a
boyfriend.

744
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:04,018
ldiot, as soon as you repair it..

745
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,895
..the lift should go two floors below.

746
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:16,781
What is that?

747
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,452
My cell phone is on vibration mode.

748
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,543
l am not sure whether it will work or not.

749
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,880
Now you may land.

750
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,554
Okay? - Yes. Now. Do it now.

751
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,139
Do it quickly.

752
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:48,730
Okay? - Okay.

753
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,276
Okay. - Okay.

754
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,488
l'm feeling very hot.

755
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,657
Me too.

756
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,290
Vicco Vajradanti? - Yes.

757
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:10,585
Me too.

758
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,754
Should l show you?

759
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,302
For me. - Okay.

760
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,184
Now this lift will stop on
the ground floor.

761
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:42,909
"When you're in love why get scared?"

762
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:49,666
"We are in love and we are not thieves.
Why to sigh in solitude."

763
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,794
"When you're in love why get scared?"

764
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,222
Oh, thank God. - Excuse me.

765
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,517
Sweetheart! , where is he?
Where is that hooligan? Where..

766
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,645
He escaped. Come, Sweetheart!.

767
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:15,066
l've already paid Don Gani's man.

768
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,443
Who is this Don Gani?
l don't know any Gani.

769
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,320
What did he say?
He doesn't know Don Gani?

770
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:24,075
l want Rs.2.5 million. Right now or else..

771
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,828
Hello. - Golden.

772
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,246
Why did you call?

773
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,623
l want a meeting with you. - Why?

774
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:33,251
Call Radhe for the meeting.

775
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,936
Your men crossed into my area.

776
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,315
Let me take a look at him carefully.

777
00:53:58,903 --> 00:53:59,986
Why are you staring at me?

778
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:01,446
Do you want to marry off
your sister with me?

779
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,866
l paid you to beat up Genghis.

780
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,452
And now you've joined hands with them?

781
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,329
l work only for money.

782
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,290
You pay me handsomely. l'll kill him.

783
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,337
Scoundrel, you're very cunning.

784
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,883
l have two conditions for the compromise.

785
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:24,135
First,
your men will not operate in my area.

786
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,262
And second, l want Shiva.

787
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,642
Golden, will you kill me?

788
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:31,893
You want to kill me?

789
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,061
His photograph got published in
the papers.

790
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,354
Does that make him a hero?

791
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,981
He extorts money in my area and
says he doesn't know Don Gani.

792
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:40,276
l'm a hero.
And l'll say it in front of you.

793
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,611
Who is this Don Gani?

794
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,488
You.. - Golden!

795
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,784
Why are you getting angry? Sit down.
Relax. Just sit down.

796
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,912
Why are you getting angry at him?

797
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,872
He says what l tell him.

798
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,793
Even l don't know your Don Gani.

799
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,423
You've come to meet him and
he has set you up.

800
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,763
Let's finish them all and go.

801
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,017
What did you say? Look at me and say it.

802
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,603
Hey, tell him what kind of a man is
Datta Pawale.

803
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:19,440
Stupid! ldiot! Have you lost it?
He's crazy.

804
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,401
You'll kill us? ln our area?

805
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:22,610
Let go of his collar.

806
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,362
l won't. What will you do?
What will you do?

807
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:28,324
Don't worry about this loud mouth.
Just say yes.

808
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,785
Who is he to say anything?
What will you do if he says yes?

809
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,953
What will you do?

810
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,372
l have decided.
- Who are you to decide anything?

811
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,124
Hey, you're just a new kid.

812
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,417
l've been in this business for 20 years.

813
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,043
l've killed more than 50.

814
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,212
Why are you looking at him?
- Tell me quickly. Say yes.

815
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,507
What can he say? l say yes. Look here..

816
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,575
Kill him!

817
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,376
No! No!

818
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,354
He says he doesn't know Don Gani.

819
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,898
He doesn't know Don Gani!
He doesn't know Don Gani!

820
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,399
Let him go. He has got know.

821
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:47,111
You fool! Because of you,
all of us would have been dead.

822
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,404
Do you need him?

823
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,491
Will you kill him? Will you kill him?

824
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:56,287
Hey, come on. Get going. - Darn you.

825
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,706
When will the Mumbai police wake up?

826
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,874
Sir, so many people are being killed..

827
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,292
..and you're giving such routine answers?

828
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,877
You can't stay silent like this.

829
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,005
lf the media can reach the gangsters,
why can't the police?

830
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,091
The police don't know anything
but to take bribe.

831
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,474
She has come.

832
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,853
Hi. - Hi.

833
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,650
You're going home? - Yes.

834
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,696
What's in the box?

835
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,490
Pasta.

836
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:34,450
Let me have it. - lt's empty.

837
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,500
Are you annoyed with me?

838
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,585
l tried to call you several times.

839
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,879
Sometimes it's switched off
and other times..

840
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,048
Which number did you dial?

841
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,634
9821066660.

842
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,887
That's not my number. 9894536993.

843
00:57:58,851 --> 00:57:59,934
Three.

844
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,481
l tried your number several times as well.

845
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,527
lf you want my number.

846
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,488
Just ask for it.
l'll give you a missed call. Feed it in.

847
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,703
They are my friends. - Hello. - Hi.

848
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,916
Oh, sorry.

849
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,591
These Mumbai trains are so shaky.

850
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,637
Yes.

851
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,688
Excuse me. - Yes.

852
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,024
He is sitting here already. - Who?

853
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,026
My husband.

854
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,402
He has gone to the toilet.

855
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,531
There's no toilet in a local train.

856
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,283
Please get up. - Why?

857
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,576
Get up! - What?

858
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:03,539
ldiot, don't bug me.
Get out of here or else l'll punch you.

859
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:04,707
She's such a bully!

860
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,418
Don't panic. Please be seated.

861
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:14,175
The train on platform number 7 is..

862
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,980
Sister is at home.

863
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,693
Son, don't push like that.

864
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:36,739
We are men.
lt might hurt our delicate parts.

865
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,746
There must have been pasta in this
lunch-box.- Correct

866
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,585
You are of no use to me, Brother.

867
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,714
Brother? l see. You mean brother-in-law.

868
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,217
My sister is great, isn't she?

869
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,553
But tell her to call me.

870
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,681
All right. But only on one condition.
- What?

871
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,808
How did you build such a physique?

872
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,688
Are you trying to make fun of me?

873
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,024
No. l'm serious. Give me some tips.

874
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:18,489
Eat less and go the toilet many times.

875
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,409
Yes, that's what my sister does. - What?

876
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,369
Yes. - Oh no!

877
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,706
Which song were you playing?

878
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:31,419
"Pasta, pasta, l've fallen in love."

879
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,884
Hi, Laxmi. How are you?
ls your health all right?

880
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,678
Did you talk to Jahnvi about me?

881

You're the guy who found a gun

You gave it back.

You sell drugs? - lt's gone.

969
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:58,972
The headmaster of the school where

..comes to learn from me even today.

971

Look, l still have the bullets.

976
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,498
Are you threatening me?

01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,667
You have to account for every bullet.

978
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:31,547
l may shoot as many as l want.
l don't have to give any account.

979

Do you think l'm the constable
from your police station?

981
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,139
Should l tell you how you killed him?

982
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:50,941
A 2000 sq. ft. shop has been
registered in your wife's name.

983
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,860
l don't want to argue with you.

The construction is on fast track.

You're using ltalian marble, aren't you?

988
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,163
Nandini will be very happy with you.
- Go away.

Oh, God!

01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:18,510
Jahnvi is mine. Only mine.

996
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,387
And l can do anything for her.

997
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,737
Three. Four. Five. Six.
Seven. Eight. One..

998
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,155
Oh God!

999
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:44,745
What's going on? - Hey, shut up! Shut up!

1000
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,166
Who is that boyfriend of yours?

1001
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,210
you want a real man?

1002
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,003
Am l not good enough?

1003
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:55,631
Did your mom talk to you about me?

1004
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:58,217
You are mine.

1005
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:04,223
He says, "Jahnvi is mine and
l can do anything for her."

1006
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:10,479
lf you meet him again, l'll kill you.

1007
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:22,032
"Jahnvi is mine and
l can do anything for her."

1008
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:33,043
Sister, what you're saying is fine, but..

1009
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,419
He's a goon, isn't he?

1010
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:36,922
But he's good at heart.

1011
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,258
l'm sure l can change him.

1012
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,051
Do you love him so much?

1013
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,223
Yes.

1014
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,059
All right. But he will have to bring
chocolates for me everyday.

"My darling, this is true.."

"..but love has thrilled our lives."

1073
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:21,540
"My heart has gone out of my control."

1074
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:25,961

"Then love me, baby. Love me."

1085
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:07,669
You wanted to meet me. Here l am.

1086
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:11,381
l've been sitting here like
a stone since half an hour.

1087
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,550
What do you want to say?

1088
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,470
l just wanted to say to you..

1089
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:22,934
..that you don't have any
qualities that l like.

1090
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:30,609
Still, l don't know why
l think of you all the time.

1091
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:37,574
Whenever l asked my heart
who's my Mr. Right..

1092
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,660
..it took your name.

1093
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:46,958
By now, you must have guessed
what l want to say.

1094
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,545
So, why don't you say it first?

1095
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,131
l'd like it.

1096
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,594
Yes, l love you.

1097
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:02,557
But l haven't said it to you until now..

1098
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,062
..because l'm not worthy of you.

1099
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,605
Why?

1100
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:13,068
l don't know myself how
big a scoundrel l am.

1101
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:15,278
But l like you very much.

1102
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,613
Think again.

1103
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:21,451
Once l commit something,
l don't listen to myself even.

1104
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,467
Close your eyes.

1105
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,472
Just close your eyes.

1106
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:48,603

1107
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:30,747
No.

1108
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,358
No.. - No.

1109
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:00,777
No!

1110
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:04,030
They must have finished Radhe by now.

1111
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,286
Take the call, rascal!

1112
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,013
Rascal!

1113
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,822
Take the call, rascal!

1114
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:23,693
You thought l was a petty thief.

1115
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:40,877
l'm a murderer.

1116
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,881
Would you still say that you love me?

1117
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:52,180
Listen, l love you.

1118
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:56,851
You think about it again.

1119
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,260
Jahnvi, don't you want to go to office?

1120
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,476

01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:50,363
'Police are trying to find out
which gang they belonged to.'

1124
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,491
'Mumbai Commission Ashraf Khan has given..'

1125

'..shoot-at-sight orders to his
special forces.'

Why? - They started it. l finished it.

1132
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:23,605
Do you know what has been
the reaction to this?

1133
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:27,317
Datta Pawale has killed Golden.

1134
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:29,694
Hey, what happened?
- What happened?

1135
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:34,866
You're his next target.

l thought after knowing That,
you'd try to change.

1142
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:20,680
Why?

1143
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,224
Murder there!
- There has been a murder in the back lane.

1144
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:25,852
What do l do now?

1145
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,313
Should l love you or forget you?

1146
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,485
Forget me.

For me, it's not wrong to kill.

1153
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,881
You've done the wrong thing
by falling in love with me.

Now people will think that you've been raped.

1264
01:35:14,876 --> 01:35:16,960
Save my daughter!

1265
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,883

You'll have to tell us where they touched you..

01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:06,802
Go away from here.

1278
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:12,724
You have been disgraced.

1279
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,810
Who will marry her now?

1280
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:19,398

Sir, pay up.

Hey, stop. Stop!

1290
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:25,255
Salute, sir. - Pay me protection money.

Sir, this week the business was down, so..

1293
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:39,019
"A thorn pricked me."

1294
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:49,112
Hey! Who is it?

1295
01:38:03,753 --> 01:38:05,045
Who is it? Who was it?

1296
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:07,047
Stop. - Scoundrel!

1297
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:29,945
Who is it? Who was it?

1298
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:31,697
Who is it?

1299
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:37,411
Hello. - Scoundrel!

1300
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:40,872
l just suspected it,
so l shed some of your blood.

1301
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,083
The day it is confirmed..

1302
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:46,086
..there'll be no blood left in your body.

1303
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:50,173
Who are you?

1304
01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:17,200
Radhe.

1305
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:25,208
Everyone is praising you.

1306
01:39:26,294 --> 01:39:27,544
Except him.

1307
01:39:28,671 --> 01:39:31,131
l hear you carry out dangerous
jobs with the snap of your fingers.

1308
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:34,009
You look like a romantic hero.

1309
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:37,137
And you look like a villain
in a B-grade Hindi movie.

1310
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,309
You have no idea how villainous l can be.

1311
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:45,228
What will you drink? - Nothing.

1312
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:47,606
Don't be scared. Have it.

1313
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:50,776
Liquor and blood. l take it when l want it.

1314
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,235
No holds barred.

1315
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,947
He is exactly as you had told me.

1316
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:58,992
Are you hurt? Then smile. Don't shout.

1317
01:39:59,702 --> 01:40:01,244
lf you'd like to be a goon.

1318
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:05,165
So, you're a rough guy.

1319
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,416
And crazy as well.

1320
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:09,419
You'll take Golden's place from today.

1321
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,049
You have to eliminate central minister.
This is your first job.

1322
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:16,760
On 14th November, Children's day..

1323
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,054
..the minister is coming as a chief guest.

1324
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:20,806
Blow him away with a bomb.

1325
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:23,266
And the kids?

1326
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:24,726
What kids?

1327
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:27,604
Those who will be around the minister.

1328
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,066
Kill them. This is my style.

1329
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:34,069
l don't kill women and kids.

1330
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:35,987
Why?

1331
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:38,365
That's my style.

1332
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:40,534
lf you don't do it, Genghis will do it.

1333
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:44,746
Even if he were Genghis Khan,
l wouldn't allow him to do it.

1334
01:40:44,831 --> 01:40:45,914
Hey!

1335
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,043
Arrogance.

1336
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:51,253
Such ego.

1337
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:52,671
l like it.

1338
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,091
Bring it down. You'll be very successful.

1339
01:40:56,843 --> 01:40:58,301
Or else you'll go up there.

1340
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,220
Think about it.

1341
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:05,016
Once l commit to something,
l don't listen to myself even.

1342
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:08,687
"Pour ke lo se (Spanish)."

1343
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:10,772

Come.

Ashraf Khan, you've made the biggest
mistake of your life..

1392
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:50,051
..by arresting me.

1393
01:45:50,136 --> 01:45:51,219
lt's not a mistake.

1394
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:54,597
lt's my life's ambition to punish you.

1395
01:45:56,517 --> 01:45:59,686
You don't want to punish me.
You want something else.

1396
01:46:01,772 --> 01:46:03,148
You want to cut a deal with me?

1397
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:04,941
l'm giving you an opportunity.

1398

You offer namaz five times a day,

01:46:09,071 --> 01:46:11,614
l kill five people at that same time.

1400
01:46:12,616 --> 01:46:13,700
Look at my hand.

1401
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:17,537
lt is very charitable.

1402
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:21,541
With this hand, l've made millionaires..

1403
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:22,876
..out of honest policemen.

1404
01:46:24,253 --> 01:46:27,172
Shake hands with me. l'll make you filthy rich.

1405
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:32,343
You've not faced a strict police officer yet.

1406
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:35,555
The moment you come across an
honest police officer..

1407
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:39,642
..you'll wet your pants.

1408
01:46:41,437 --> 01:46:42,562
lt's not wet.

1409
01:46:44,565 --> 01:46:46,024
ls it wet?. Then?

1410
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:49,652
Listen, you fool.

1411
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:53,364
You're only a police commissioner of Mumbai.

1412
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:55,575
l'm an international don.

1413
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:59,746
Higher ranking officers than you salute me.

1414
01:47:00,206 --> 01:47:05,585
l salute only the lndian Tricolour,
not a scoundrel like you.

1415
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:09,380
You'll salute this scoundrel one day.

1416
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:14,594
l will. l'll surely salute you.

1417
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:17,388
Listen, he's a big don.

1418
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:19,390
See to it that he is served properly.

1419
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:22,602
Fulfil every wish of his,
but don't let him sleep.

1420
01:47:23,229 --> 01:47:25,605
Break his bones if he tries to sleep.

1421
01:47:34,073 --> 01:47:37,075
l won't sleep.

1422
01:47:37,243 --> 01:47:40,245
My eyes will be open even if l die.

1423
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:49,003
Sir. - Have you arrested Don Gani?

1424
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:51,798
No, sir. How can l arrest Gani?

1425
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,341
Not even lnterpol can do it. - Quiet!

1426
01:47:53,634 --> 01:47:57,428
l won't rest till l arrest him.

1427
01:47:57,888 --> 01:48:00,640
As soon as l arrest him, l'll inform you.

1428
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:02,058
Sir.

1429
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:05,270
He said he didn't. - What?

1430
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:08,523
He.. - The minister had called.

1431
01:48:09,191 --> 01:48:10,900
Nobody should know that he's here.

1432
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:12,277
Okay? - Sir.

1433
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:15,822
Hello. - Hello. Yes, this is Gani speaking.

1434
01:48:15,906 --> 01:48:17,115
Over here.

1435
01:48:18,993 --> 01:48:21,661
lncoming free. No outgoing. Latest stuff.

1436
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:25,665
Keep an eye on him. Understand?
- Okay, sir.

1437
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:27,667
What's this nonsense?

1438
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:29,460
Commissioner didn't put Gani behind bars.

1439
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:32,297
These high level tricks are
hard to understand.

1440
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:37,844
Brother, do you want the friend or the girl?
- girl.

1441
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:01,409
Yes, tell me. - Where are you?

1442
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:03,703
Outside Andheri post office.

1443
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:05,580
No. You're nearby.

1444
01:49:14,506 --> 01:49:16,507
l feel you're looking at me.

1445
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:25,725
l'm at the post office.

1446
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:29,270
lf l truly love you, then you're here.

1447
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:36,277
Brother, what are you eating? Pilaf?

1448
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:38,905
No, tobacco. Want some?

1449
01:49:39,531 --> 01:49:41,991
Find one more friend. He'll be
helpful while carrying your coffin.

1450
01:49:42,534 --> 01:49:43,618
You can have it then.

1451
01:49:48,374 --> 01:49:49,832
So this is Andheri post office?

1452
01:49:50,918 --> 01:49:52,752
Go straight and take a right.
lt's near the railway station.

1453
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:55,463
You said you're not here.

1454
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:00,760
How would someone who only knows to kill..

1455
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,762
..understand someone's feelings?

1456
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:07,225
lf you really love me, you'd understand this.

1457
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:09,227
Do you love someone?

1458
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:12,230
l did till now. But now l don't.

1459
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:15,316
You are getting angry on a joke.

1460
01:50:16,235 --> 01:50:19,404
Would l dream that you are around?

1461
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:21,781
This is why l hate you.

1462
01:50:22,574 --> 01:50:23,658
l hate you.

1463
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,410
Why are you harassing me?

1464
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:27,787
Go on. lt's time for your aerobics class.

1465
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:29,330
Vent your anger over there.

1466
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:35,795
Aslam. - Yes.

1467
01:50:36,046 --> 01:50:37,797
ls your girl like her? - How?

1468
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:38,965
Emotional.

1469
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:40,800
Having a girlfriend is a bad thing.

1470
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:42,135
Waste of time.

1471
01:50:42,511 --> 01:50:44,804
You'd better have a pet than a girlfriend.

1472
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:50,935
l'll do just what you said.

1473
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:52,854
l'll never meet you again.

1474
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:55,106
Tell her to go.

1475
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:57,400
She keeps appearing like advertisements on TV.

1476
01:50:58,027 --> 01:51:00,028
Tell her. - She already left.

1477
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:04,741
She didn't leave. She is fuming.

1478
01:51:25,054 --> 01:51:28,431
Scoundrel! Why did you come back to Mumbai?

1479
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,516
What's your plan?

1480
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,435
Speak! Answer me!

1481
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:36,981
The plan is in my head. Let go of my hair.

1482
01:51:37,775 --> 01:51:39,525
You may be a big don for the world..

1483
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,903
..but you're nothing for me.

1484
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:45,448
l can kill you like this. - Then do it.

1485
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:46,783
Kill me. Why don't you?

1486
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:48,910
l'll tell you what you can do.

1487
01:51:50,162 --> 01:51:53,456
At the most you can present me in court.
That's it.

1488
01:51:53,957 --> 01:51:55,041
Nothing else.

1489
01:51:56,043 --> 01:51:57,752
You know what l'll say in court?

1490
01:51:58,962 --> 01:52:03,424
l'll tell the court that Amitabh Bachchan
is a good friend of mine.

1491
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:06,886
And Shah Rukh Khan is my
business partner.

1492
01:52:07,346 --> 01:52:09,889
We had met at a wedding in London.
l have video evidence.

1493
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:13,976
lt's different that
l have no relations with them.

1494
01:52:14,353 --> 01:52:19,315
But it will take ten years to
prove this in court.

1495
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:20,775
Yes.

1496
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:28,533
What are you thinking?

1497
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:30,159
lt's not too late.

1498
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:33,079
Cut a deal. - Scoundrel!

1499
01:52:33,789 --> 01:52:35,915
You talk of striking a deal all the time.

1500
01:52:36,792 --> 01:52:40,169
Did you strike a deal with
your mother to bring you out?

1501
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:44,924
l was too small. l don't remember.

1502
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:53,933
l think he's very angry with me.

1503
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,727
lt is Churchgate local..

1504
01:52:56,812 --> 01:52:57,937
Hey let's go!

1505
01:52:58,647 --> 01:52:59,730
Where are you going?

1506
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:01,023
lt will stop on all the stations.

1507
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:08,739
Oh you missed the catch.

1508
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:23,963
Hot tea! Hot tea!

1509
01:53:24,047 --> 01:53:25,131
Sir, would you like some hot tea?

1510
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:28,134
Chhotu, give me a cup of tea. - Yes.

1511
01:53:29,511 --> 01:53:30,595
Go away!

1512
01:53:30,679 --> 01:53:31,762
Don't sell tea here.

1513
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:33,973
Hot tea. Hot tea.

1514
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:35,141
l've been sitting here since a while.

1515
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:39,979
The train has been delayed. ls it my fault?

1516
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:43,441
Why are you doing this to me?

1517
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:45,693
Why don't you give it all up?

1518
01:53:46,403 --> 01:53:48,988
Why don't you leave your loafer friends?

1519
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:51,157
They are my friends.

1520
01:53:51,992 --> 01:53:55,077
They are not like cigarettes that
you throw after you're done smoking.

1521
01:53:56,622 --> 01:53:59,624
l'm not a balloon that you
let go after filling it with air.

1522
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:03,336
Balloon? - l mean l'm not a chewing gum..

1523
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,712
..that you open it, chew it and spit it out.

1524
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:11,802
When did l open it? When did l chew it?

1525
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:14,180
You talk about spitting it?

1526
01:54:15,432 --> 01:54:17,016
What have you done for me till now?

1527
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:21,020
Pasta. Pasta.
The whole family lives on pasta.

1528
01:54:21,355 --> 01:54:25,566
Have you ever asked me?
"Listen, have some pasta."

1529
01:54:26,026 --> 01:54:27,109
No.

1530
01:54:28,737 --> 01:54:30,196
You want to spend your life with me?

1531
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:32,281
Do you know how l live?

1532
01:54:33,575 --> 01:54:34,659
l live on snacks.

1533
01:54:35,911 --> 01:54:38,204
Then eat. Eat me. Eat me!

1534
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,832
l don't like meat which has too much fat.

1535
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:47,463
Eat it. Have some pasta!

1536
01:55:18,078 --> 01:55:21,163
Gani, my friend. Don't sleep.
They will kill you.

1537
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:22,540
They will..

1538
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:25,084
Why are you staring at me?

1539
01:55:26,878 --> 01:55:29,255
Strike a deal for me with the commissioner.

1540
01:55:30,882 --> 01:55:33,092
Go on. Talk to him.

1541
01:55:36,722 --> 01:55:38,639
l'll give you whatever you want.

1542
01:55:38,724 --> 01:55:40,349
Just get me out of here.

1543
01:55:41,101 --> 01:55:43,102
Scoundrel.. you don't listen to me.

1544
01:55:43,729 --> 01:55:49,567
"The world is sleeping. So is the sky."

1545
01:57:31,294 --> 01:57:32,670
l've found out about Don Gani.

1546
01:57:33,213 --> 01:57:35,381
This is his passport to freedom.

1547
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:37,550
Commissioner's daughter.

1548
01:57:38,385 --> 01:57:39,760
l had seen it just two days back.

1549
01:57:40,846 --> 01:57:41,929
What are you doing?

1550
01:57:42,013 --> 01:57:43,222
Who are you?

1551
01:57:43,390 --> 01:57:45,224
Help me! Please help me!

1552
01:57:46,226 --> 01:57:47,393
Let me go!

1553
01:57:47,561 --> 01:57:48,602
Let go!

1554
01:57:48,687 --> 01:57:49,854
l say let me go!

1555
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:55,693
Sir, the courier delivered this.

1556
01:57:57,028 --> 01:57:58,112
Check what is it.

1557
01:57:58,238 --> 01:57:59,864
l've couriered a CD to you.

1558
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:02,575
View it. l'll hold the line till then.

1559
01:58:03,243 --> 01:58:04,326
Play it.

1560
01:58:21,052 --> 01:58:22,511
No!

1561
01:58:24,264 --> 01:58:28,350
Hey, you scoundrel! l'll finish you all!

1562
01:58:28,727 --> 01:58:29,810
Shut up!

1563
01:58:29,978 --> 01:58:31,896
lf you don't release Gani..

1564
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:35,441
..the whole world will see this CD on TV,
internet and cell phone.

1565
01:58:35,609 --> 01:58:36,692
Do you get me?

1566
01:58:43,450 --> 01:58:46,535
Scoundrel! Don't spare him.

1567
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:51,165
The commissioner will not sleep peacefully
from now on. - Yes, boss.

1568
01:58:51,291 --> 01:58:54,835
Scoundrel! The CD should be all over.

1569
01:58:55,086 --> 01:58:56,170
Let me see.

1570
01:58:56,546 --> 01:58:57,630
lt's superb.

1571
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:01,008
Look at this. New stuff.

1572
01:59:01,092 --> 01:59:02,176
lt's great.

1573
01:59:05,013 --> 01:59:08,474
Tell you husband to keep his mouth shut.
Understand?

1574
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:13,395
lf he takes any action or orders an enquiry..

1575
01:59:14,397 --> 01:59:15,940
..we'll kill you daughter.

1576

Being a woman, you don't
respect another woman.

You had come to our house
and troubled my sister.

1597
02:00:56,207 --> 02:00:57,291
So?

Fatso, what will you do?

1605
02:01:18,146 --> 02:01:19,438
Why are you hitting me?

1606
02:01:24,235 --> 02:01:25,444
You will stop us?

1607
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:28,447
Look, we're at Andheri station.
- Now speak.

1608
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:45,881

You'll beat us up?

Do you have the guts?

1612

Look, the don of Andheri. Scoundrel!

More than the goons l'm afraid of you.

l don't know whether you're good or bad.

All l know is that l love you.

1616
02:04:01,601 --> 02:04:06,230
Sweetheart, Radhe is the
right guy for you, not me.

1617
02:04:07,315 --> 02:04:08,607
Forget me if you can.

1618
02:04:09,609 --> 02:04:10,692
He's the right guy.

1619
02:04:22,622 --> 02:04:24,331

Your father dishonoured me in jail.

1625
02:04:47,647 --> 02:04:49,648
Now my men will rape you.

He'll finish you.

He was so small when l brought him home.

1702

What more would a father want from his son?

1723
02:10:42,084 --> 02:10:45,629
Only a police officer can feel this happiness.

1724

02:11:07,193 --> 02:11:08,276
He is on a mission.

02:11:10,112 --> 02:11:13,448
To free this nation of viruses like you.

1733
02:11:14,742 --> 02:11:17,035
Criminals like you are violating..

..the courts, law, order and
justice of this nation.

1735

He couldn't touch me.

Here l am in lndia.

You were forced to come here.

1741

My son killed your right hand.

1742
02:11:52,071 --> 02:11:54,864

So either of us will live?

One patriot is in front of me.

1747
02:12:32,111 --> 02:12:33,445
Where's the other one?

02:12:50,838 --> 02:12:52,130
He will kill you.

1753
02:12:53,299 --> 02:12:58,136
He will stand in front of you.
He will look you in the eye.

1754
02:12:59,555 --> 02:13:03,308
So, you're scared of death, aren't you?

1755
02:13:05,394 --> 02:13:10,148
Remember one thing, the moment you kill me..

1756
02:13:10,232 --> 02:13:16,154
.. the countdown to your death will begin.

1757
02:13:17,782 --> 02:13:19,407
None of you will live.

1758
02:13:20,785 --> 02:13:21,951
He'll kill all of you.

1759
02:13:23,788 --> 02:13:25,497
lt's 12th November today.

1760
02:13:27,166 --> 02:13:28,500
The day l die.

1761
02:13:30,419 --> 02:13:35,173
Tomorrow, it will be 13th November.
The day you die.

1762
02:13:40,805 --> 02:13:42,639
Nice meeting you, Mr. Shrikant Shekhawat.

1763
02:13:44,058 --> 02:13:45,183
Nice meeting you.

1764
02:13:48,062 --> 02:13:49,187
All right, tell me something.

1765
02:13:50,815 --> 02:13:53,191
Will your son come to cry
over your dead body?

1766
02:13:54,610 --> 02:13:56,820
Or he will hide away out of fear?

1767
02:13:57,613 --> 02:13:59,906
He's a real man. He'll surely come.

1768
02:14:20,094 --> 02:14:22,011
Tell me. - There are policemen everywhere.

1769
02:14:22,096 --> 02:14:23,221
How do we kill him?

1770
02:14:23,848 --> 02:14:25,932
Don't even attempt to do such a thing.

1771
02:14:26,016 --> 02:14:27,100
Did you find out who he is?

1772
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:28,560
No.

1773
02:14:42,324 --> 02:14:43,408
Oh, my God!

1774
02:14:45,661 --> 02:14:46,703
Him?

1775
02:14:47,121 --> 02:14:48,246
Move! Move!

1776
02:15:39,006 --> 02:16:22,340
"O Lord."

1777
02:16:52,371 --> 02:16:54,455
'A person lives on his own terms.'

1778
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:58,084
'Fight courageously while performing
your duty.'

1779
02:16:59,003 --> 02:17:00,253
'This is the right path.'

1780
02:17:00,379 --> 02:17:03,381
'l'll be proud to call you a
good police officer..

1781
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:05,383
..rather than a good son.'

1782
02:17:06,176 --> 02:17:09,387
'To annihilate crime should be
your life's ambition.'

1783
02:17:09,471 --> 02:17:11,723
'Alone, you're equal to an army.'

1784
02:17:11,807 --> 02:17:13,391
'You're a one man army.'

1785
02:17:13,726 --> 02:17:16,269
'Serve the people. Die
for your country.'

1786
02:17:16,395 --> 02:17:17,645
'Live like a legend.'

1787
02:17:23,402 --> 02:17:24,485
'Hail lndia.'

1788
02:17:38,417 --> 02:17:41,419
He is still here. As soon as he
leaves here, l'll call you.

1789
02:17:41,837 --> 02:17:42,879
Okay.

1790
02:17:43,130 --> 02:17:47,133
Gani deserves to die.

1791
02:17:48,677 --> 02:17:52,430
He should suffer so much while dying..

1792
02:17:52,514 --> 02:17:55,224
..that even death gets afraid.

1793
02:17:55,309 --> 02:17:57,435
Scoundrel! l didn't know
he's an lPS officer.

1794
02:17:57,519 --> 02:17:58,686
And l told him everything.

1795
02:17:58,896 --> 02:18:02,982
Sir, he'll change his plan.
Because he told me about it.

1796
02:18:03,233 --> 02:18:04,776
Yes, he'll think along these lines.

1797
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:06,444
But l'll not change the plan.

1798
02:18:06,528 --> 02:18:10,323
November 14th. He'll get this
job done by someone else.

1799
02:18:10,449 --> 02:18:12,617
November 14th is my day.

1800
02:18:12,701 --> 02:18:14,619
Everything will go as per my plan.

1801
02:18:14,787 --> 02:18:17,455
He knows the plan. So only the
location will change, not the plan.

1802
02:18:17,915 --> 02:18:19,457
Move! Move! Move, everyone!

1803
02:18:20,709 --> 02:18:26,464
He still has my daughter.

1804
02:18:26,882 --> 02:18:27,924
l'll go there, sir.

1805
02:18:28,884 --> 02:18:30,468
Nothing will happen to your daughter.

1806
02:18:37,476 --> 02:18:41,187
l'll kill or get killed.

1807
02:18:44,358 --> 02:18:46,275
Think of me being a criminal for one more day.

1808
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:06,504
Me? - Yes, you.

1809
02:19:09,508 --> 02:19:10,591
Yes, sir?

1810
02:19:15,514 --> 02:19:17,223
Sir.. sir everyone is watching.

1811
02:19:23,063 --> 02:19:24,147
Yes, sir?

1812
02:19:24,231 --> 02:19:28,943
Will you perform your duty or
should l free you of it?

1813
02:19:29,403 --> 02:19:32,071
l didn't get you.

1814
02:19:36,535 --> 02:19:37,994
Where is he? - Who?

1815
02:19:40,330 --> 02:19:42,248
Gani. Your boss.

1816
02:19:42,541 --> 02:19:47,336
l..

1817
02:19:56,555 --> 02:19:58,556
Ask him where he is.

1818
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:00,266
Boss..

1819
02:20:02,186 --> 02:20:03,644
Ask him where he is.

1820
02:20:04,438 --> 02:20:06,814
Hello, Talpade. - Hello, Don Gani.

1821
02:20:07,107 --> 02:20:08,566
Yes, tell me. Did he leave?

1822
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:11,027
No. No. l'll inform you when he leaves.

1823
02:20:11,111 --> 02:20:15,573
Are you safe? Don't enter the city.

1824
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:17,825
Don't teach me. l'm safe.

1825
02:20:18,285 --> 02:20:20,119
ln which safe place are you?

1826
02:20:20,579 --> 02:20:24,040
Binny Mills. - Okay. l'll call you later.
- Move! Move!

1827
02:20:24,124 --> 02:20:25,208
Yes. Yes.

02:20:37,596 --> 02:20:39,055
Hello, Don Gani. - Yes, tell me.

1829
02:20:39,139 --> 02:20:40,598
He.. he has come.

1830
02:20:41,016 --> 02:20:42,141
Where? - Binny Mills.

1831
02:20:42,601 --> 02:20:44,602
Who told him l'm here? - l did.

1832
02:20:44,853 --> 02:20:46,604
ldiot! Fool!

1833
02:20:46,688 --> 02:20:47,772
Why did you tell him?

1834
02:20:47,856 --> 02:20:50,066
When you called, he was with me
and his gun at my temple.

1835
02:20:50,317 --> 02:20:51,400
What could l have done?

1836
02:20:51,485 --> 02:20:52,610
Where is he now?

1837
02:20:53,612 --> 02:20:54,695
He has entered the mill.

1838
02:20:54,863 --> 02:20:57,156
He is here. Come on! Move!

1839
02:20:58,033 --> 02:20:59,408
Come on! Move!

1840
02:21:38,282 --> 02:21:39,991
Boss, he is right in front of me.
- Kill! Kill him!

1841
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,201
How much will you pay to kill him?
- have you eve counted 10 million?

1842
02:21:42,661 --> 02:21:44,287
l'll pay you Rs.50 million. Kill him.

1843
02:24:13,812 --> 02:24:16,814
Boss! Over there!

1844
02:24:34,833 --> 02:24:36,834
Come on, kill! Kill him!

1845
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:42,631
No!

1846
02:24:43,091 --> 02:24:44,550
Darn it! Scoundrel!

1847
02:24:52,267 --> 02:24:53,309
You..

1848
02:24:54,478 --> 02:24:56,854
Kill him! Kill him!

1849
02:25:02,652 --> 02:25:03,736
Go!

1850
02:25:44,903 --> 02:25:46,237
Kill him! Kill him!

1851
02:26:53,305 --> 02:26:56,974
'The moment you come across
a honest police officer..'

1852
02:26:57,058 --> 02:27:00,311
'..you'll wet your pants.'

1853
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:11,697
Darn you! You killed everyone?

1854
02:27:13,450 --> 02:27:14,533
You killed everyone.

1855
02:27:15,535 --> 02:27:17,536
Can't you differentiate between
animals and humans?

1856
02:27:19,331 --> 02:27:23,000
They're criminals.
Such men are so rare to find.

1857
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:25,002
l've nurtured them for years.

1858
02:27:26,004 --> 02:27:28,339
l searched and picked
each one from the streets.

1859
02:27:31,176 --> 02:27:33,010
Anyone can become a policeman.

1860
02:27:34,012 --> 02:27:35,095
l can make hundreds
of policemen like you ..

1861
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:36,805
..stand in front of me
tomorrow morning.

1862
02:27:36,890 --> 02:27:38,015
Where will l get them?

1863
02:27:41,811 --> 02:27:42,895
Darn you!

1864
02:28:05,752 --> 02:28:07,294
Stop it, man. Stop it.

1865
02:28:07,462 --> 02:28:09,046
You're overdoing it. Stop it.

1866
02:28:09,923 --> 02:28:12,049
You're too much.

1867
02:28:13,385 --> 02:28:15,052
Why are you killing a murderer?

1868
02:28:16,054 --> 02:28:17,137
Who are you?

1869
02:28:20,850 --> 02:28:22,142
What do you want?

1870
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:26,063
l'll give you whatever you want.
Just join hands with me.

1871
02:28:27,232 --> 02:28:30,067
How much will you get in a police job?

1872
02:28:30,777 --> 02:28:32,069
lf you die on duty..

1873
02:28:32,153 --> 02:28:35,072
..the government will give
Rs.50000 to your family.

1874
02:28:35,156 --> 02:28:36,240
That's it.

1875
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:39,076
And they'll wear black
bands around their arms..

1876
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:41,078
..to mourn your death.

1877
02:28:41,162 --> 02:28:42,329
Just for a day.

1878
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:44,957
Join hands with me.

1879
02:28:46,084 --> 02:28:47,167
Heaven..

1880
02:28:48,086 --> 02:28:49,336
l'll show you heaven.

1881
02:28:49,963 --> 02:28:51,088
l'll show you heaven..

1882
02:29:14,279 --> 02:29:16,113
Did the deal fall through?

1883
02:29:17,741 --> 02:29:18,824
Sir?

1884
02:29:20,452 --> 02:29:21,910
Everyone will die.

1885
02:29:28,293 --> 02:29:29,752
Sir, your daughter is safe.

1886
02:29:31,546 --> 02:29:32,588
Gani has been killed.

1887
02:29:33,923 --> 02:29:36,300
Sir, the bad news is that lnspector
Talpade also got killed.

1888
02:29:41,139 --> 02:29:42,222
Sir?

1889
02:29:45,018 --> 02:29:46,143
What are you saying, sir?

1890
02:29:48,396 --> 02:29:49,480
You scou..

1891
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:56,153
Once l commit to something,
l don't listen to..

1892
02:29:56,237 --> 02:29:58,322
.. myself even.

1893
02:30:07,237 --> 02:30:09,322
