1
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,161
Fell off the ninth floor.
A case of drug overdose.

2
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:15,129
How old is he?
- 21 years.

3
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,901
Register it as an accident.
Nothing serious.

4
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,336
Take him to the morgue.

5
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:26,601
One minute...

6
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,192
A lesson for everyone of us

7
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,531
He studied in this college.
He won so many medals. ln sports.

8
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,831
Were it not for the poison...

9
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:59,636
he would surely have made
a name for himself someday.

10
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,577
l had seen in him
such self-confidence.

11
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:10,585
But today, l consider him guilty.
He had no right to kill himself.

12
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,353
For the life you live
is not only yours.

13
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,156
Your family, your society,
your country...

14
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,796
all have a right
over your lives.

15
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:25,402
ln the years to come, you'll become
doctors, teachers, engineers.

16
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,807
And you will hold offices of
significant responsibility.

17
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,500
And you must contribute to
the development of the country.

18
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,576
This speech does no respect
to the memory of Sunil Gupta.

19
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:43,145
The ones who are responsible
for his death must be punished.

20
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,487
Sunil Gupta will be avenged!
- Let's hold a rally.

21
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,221
Oh yes. And till they are arrested,
the college will remain closed.

22
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,192
No. The college isn't
going to close down.

23
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,359
A strike isn't the answer
to everything.

24
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,527
Apprehending the culprits
and taking them to task...

25
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,069
is the job of the police.
Not yours.

26
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,006
Who is the traitor?

27
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,911
Who leaked the information
about our costs?

28
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,720
l want to know!
Right now!

29
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,815
Tell me the truth. And l won't
drag it any further. l promise.

30
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:24,926
l've found the joker.
l open the game.

31
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,474
l've found the joker.
l open the game.

32
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:51,921
Drop it Uncle Montu.
The men are loyal.

33
00:04:54,827 --> 00:05:00,322
The guilty would be living
in the fear of God.

34
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,099
The rotten egg!

35
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,301
l picked you up

36
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,309
And this you do to us!

37
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,572
l didn't do it for money!

38
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,743
There you are, Narain!

39
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:27,785
And you know how
we treat traitors.

40
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,523
Take him to Uncle.

41
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,327
Let Tau deal with him.
- No! Please!

42
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,766
And he has a pretty young sister.

43
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,339
Have her sent to
the home for destitutes.

44
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,878
l'll take good care of her!

45
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,785
Why did you stop?

46
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,187
A catjust crossed our path.

47
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:02,954
So what?

48
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,459
Doesn't augur well.

49
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,030
Nonsense. Everything augurs well.
Go on. Drive.

50
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,100
Stop.

51
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,872
Take a look. Behind.

52
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,107
What do you see?

53
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,784
The cat! lt's dead!

54
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,057
Now who augurs ill for whom?

55
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,153
That cat crossed my path.

56
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:42,065
Come time to die,
you'll cross my path.

57
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,361
Go on.

58
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,818
The Boss! l want to see the Boss!

59
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:09,392
What for?

60
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,131
My husband! He works for the boss!

61
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:19,670
lt's been two days!
He hasn't come home!

62
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,904
Stop going on and on.
What's his name?

63
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,476
Tired of living so soon?

64
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,548
You betray me!

65
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,146
You betray Tau!

66
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,525
l swear! l didn't do it for money!

67
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,495
My kid! They threatened...

68
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,755
Going on and on about that kid!

69
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,300
As if you asked for permission
before producing the kid!

70
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,500
Forget it, Lalla.

71
00:07:54,841 --> 00:08:01,144
Your soul is sick of your body.
lt wants a new body.

72
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,618
l grant thee salvation.

73
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,817
Forgive me!
Forgive me!

74
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:12,547
l have a wife!

75
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:13,948
My child!

76
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:34,044
Decapitate him. Pass the head around.
No one must ever dream of treason.

77
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,250
Sure.

78
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,853
Have you spoken to Masud?

79
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,716
l tried to reason with him.
But he won't pay more than 20.

80
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:56,359
You have to coax the cow
into giving milk.

81
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,400
Set up a meeting with Masud.

82
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,983
Enough, Lord! Enough!

83
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:23,526
Another death on my hands!
l cannot bear the burden of my sins!

84
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:32,234
You are omnipotent, Lord!
Grant me absolution!

85
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,735
Punish me! Punish me for my sins!

86
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,291
Lord!

87
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,459
Here is the revolver.

88
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,889
lt's loaded.

89
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,328
And here's my head.

90
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,970
l'll pull the trigger.

91
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,649
Saved me again!

92
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,894
How long will You have me live
in this shadow of death?!

93
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,897
l understand everything!
Everything!

94
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,341
You want me to live!
So l may redeem some more of them!

95
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,437
Thy will be done, Lord!

96
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:34,686
But You make sure of one thing.
The devil must reign!

97
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:41,423
And no reincarnations, please.

98
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,286
What are you doing?
Do you take my back for a table?

99
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,548
That stuff you can't
get inside your skull.

100
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,150
So l thought you might as well
bear it's weight.

101
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:15,393
You take a go at it every morning.
And no sign of muscles.

102
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:20,904
l wonder if you could hurt a fly.

103
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,135
Daughter of a gun!

104
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,502
Let me go!
l have to go to college.

105
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,272
College is closed today.
Where are you off to?

106
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,040
l'll tell you if
you let go of my hair.

107
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,750
l'm going to
rally against drugs.

108
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,611
Do you know who is
leading the rally?

109
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,286
Who?

110
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,787
Bharat Acharya.
The president of the Youth Club.

111
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,898
Students from our college.
They have brought flowers for you.

112
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,332
Thank you.

113
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,106
Our college is with you.

114
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,143
Just what l expect from you.

115
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:13,318
How come you have achieved
so much at so young an age?

116
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,718
Who inspired you to set up
this home for women?

117
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,095
The maid who does the chores
in my house.

118
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,427
l do not understand...

119
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,162
The poor girl was widowed
at a young age.

120
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,073
l started out doing it for her.

121
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,635
Ever since l have risen
to the cause for women.

122
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:38,339
This building is the
biggest dream of my life.

123
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:43,786
lnside this building,
l will be able to serve more women.

124
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,192
l cannot bear to see
tears in a woman's eyes.

125
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,989
No! l told you!
l'm not coming!

126
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:58,829
And why not?

127
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,733
They all go, don't they?
They do, don't they?

128
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,934
Had your mother been alive,
l would've sent her too!

129
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,512
Hands off! No one helps her!

130
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,814
l have a guest coming.
A special guest.

131
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:21,050
Feed her. Get her drunk.
Then clean her up.

132
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,987
And dress her like a doll.

133
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:37,204
No use wrestling with that neck.
lt isn't going to straighten out.

134
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,908
Not all the doctors and physios
in the world could fix it.

135
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,111
Well done, nephew!

136
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,716
You're on your way
to become a minister.

137
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,988
Say what, Mr Deshmukh?

138
00:14:55,861 --> 00:15:01,561
And why not? Mr Bharat has
all the makings of a leader.

139
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,260
Quite eloquent of you.

140
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,370
But this one was born
to become a leader.

141
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,136
He was born in a
government hospital.

142
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,785
On August 15. Everyone was
celebrating independence.

143
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,819
People cheered all around.
And the new-born wailed.

144
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:31,526
He thrashed in the air
with his right hand.

145
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,165
Right then, l knew he would
make a leader.

146
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,768
That goal is now within sight.

147
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,267
l am becoming more and more popular.

148
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:47,969
And once l get a chair,
l will serve the people.

149
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:49,972
And how l will!

150
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,756
And you will win the elections
even before you have contested.

151
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,258
You haven't seen Uncle in action.

152
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,833
l'll have the photographs
sent to Pandey.

153
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,063
They will be
in the papers tomorrow.

154
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,282
Uncle? My greetings!

155
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:35,591
lt's the Uncle!

156
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,923
Yes. The photographs are
right in front of me.

157
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,025
Great photographs!

158
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,764
Bharat looks great!

159
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,841
Oh yes. Of course. Front page.

160
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,643
You're embarrassing me, Uncle.

161
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,340
This paper belongs to you.
l belong to you.

162
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,649
As you wish.

163
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,786
That was Uncle!

164
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,185
May l take your leave now,
Mr Pandey?

165
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,590
l just asked for cold drinks.
For you. You must have it.

166
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,322
Excuse me. For a minute.

167
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,441
l'll do it for you.

168
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,244
We had such hopes you would.

169
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,648
Such a beautiful word!
Hope.

170
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,316
You hoped l would.
l hope you will!

171
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,419
ln hope we strike relationships.

172
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,886
And relationships are so sweet!

173
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,525
You know what l mean to say?

174
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,025
l'm sure you understand.

175
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,025
Did you ask for me, sir?

176
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,499
Look what you've done!
15 lines devoted to 7 deaths!

177
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,069
ls this a special issue
on suicide?

178
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,708
College students. All of them.

179
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,844
lt's been 7 deaths in a week.
All drug-related cases.

180
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,316
So we fill the paper
with news of 7 deaths!

181
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,142
Drugs have killed only 7.
Tomorrow, 15 can die in a crash.

182
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,016
The story of 7 deaths
is going to be forgotten.

183
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,752
ln this city, one death
means nothing.

184
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,062
And we don't go about publishing
insignificant deaths.

185
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,764
Does any other paper do that?
Tell me.

186
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,130
This isn't insignificant.

187
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,392
You mean to teach me
how to edit?

188
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:30,939
3 lines for 7 deaths. That's all.
Put Bharat Acharya on the front page.

189
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,736
A man is doing so much for society.
He's contributing to society.

190
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,984
Why are you still standing there?
Go on. Get it done. Hurry.

191
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,220
The New Revolution!
What a revolution!

192
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:56,424
7 deaths don't mean a thing!
He will publish whatever he likes!

193
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:02,703
Why are you getting worked up?
Just let it go on.

194
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:10,805
Don't you think too much.
You'll land yourself in trouble.

195
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,991
What are you doing?
You're crowding.

196
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:30,300
Hey! What do you take me for?
Kicking up a racket for nothing!

197
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:37,739
She's right. You should keep
distance. She's a woman, after all.

198
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,310
Are you her father?

199
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,090
What happened?

200
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,895
Scalded your hand, did you?

201
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,002
l told you l'll make tea.

202
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,099
You're such a nerd.

203
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,700
Forget it. Just a bit of hot water.

204
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,209
l won't hear a thing.
Come on out.

205
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:33,124
What's happening to you?
You keep hurting yourself.

206
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,732
And you scream at me.

207
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,434
You shouldn't have been named
Prashant. (Prashant-Serene).

208
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,264
You should've been named Toofan.
(Toofan-Tempestuous)

209
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:45,502
Bring home a wife.
She will take care of you.

210
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,259
- Sorry to be late.
- Never mind.

211
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,259
At least you have come.

212
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:19,137
l'm very sorry to be late.

213
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,789
Excuse me now. l'll call you later.
l swear l will. l have to see you.

214
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,120
- What do you mean?
- l have to see you!

215
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,666
Now don't you worry.
l'll call you. l will.

216
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,482
You're late, Prashant!

217
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,552
The bus was late.

218
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,622
You're seeing me after a month.
How do l look?

219
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,088
The same.

220
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,400
Did you buy these flowers for me?

221
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,806
When l was getting down from the bus,
l saw a girl selling flowers.

222
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,507
So l thought l'd buy
some for you...

223
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,743
- Two bracelets...
- Only one. And sandals?

224
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,013
- The wedding necklace.
- No sandals either.

225
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,844
- The wedding necklace, l said.
- No wedding necklace.

226
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,210
Say that.

227
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,158
Send the corpse to the morgue.

228
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,754
Why are you standing here?
No one ever died in your family?

229
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,830
Haven't you ever seen a corpse?
Go home.

230
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:10,100
What are you doing?
You have no right to hit anyone.

231
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,169
And who are you?

232
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,539
Sub editor.
The New Revolution.

233
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,874
- Prasad Verma.
- Whoever. But l have a job to do.

234
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,450
How do l get anything done
with this crowd?

235
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,679
- What is this? Some joke?
- Precisely. A big joke.

236
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,590
What will this investigation lead to?
lt's just a sham!

237
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:34,288
What are you going to achieve?
Another file for your office?

238
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,467
Come on. Let's go home.

239
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,805
ls this some joke?
Go home!

240
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,451
My sister. Shaloo.

241
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,047
You must come over to my place
some time. With your sister.

242
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,518
l live in there. ln Bharatnagar.

243
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,324
l taught him in school, you know.

244
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,556
But you used to be
so shy in school.

245
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,168
You remember that fat boy
in your class?

246
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:18,072
He used to snatch your biscuits.
And you'd never complain. Out of fear.

247
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:28,281
l used to know the look in your eyes.
l haven't forgotten that look of fear.

248
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,478
But now l see the fire.

249
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:38,260
Don't let the fire die down.
lt's rare.

250
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,429
Use it. Give it direction.

251
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,966
l can see the dam is breaking.

252
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,400
Women work so hard for a living.

253
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,943
They should open savings accounts
in banks. They could save money.

254
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,017
Tell the bank manager that
l have recommended you.

255
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,350
Oh, it's you.

256
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:09,424
Please be seated.

257
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,930
The girl who was fished
out of the well...

258
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,068
she was living at the home
for destitutes, wasn't she?

259
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:24,603
Yes. A few days ago, she had
undergone medical tests.

260
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,540
Medical tests are carried out
every month at the home.

261
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,247
We were to have sent her for
psychiatric treatment.

262
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:37,452
But before we could do it,
she left us.

263
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,860
Was she deranged enough to
inflict injuries on herself?

264
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,729
l do not understand...?

265
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:55,764
l saw the corpse. She had bruises.
On her face. On her neck.

266
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,169
You should rather be asking
the police that.

267
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,704
Surely the bruises haven't been
recorded in the post mortem report?

268
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,576
What do you mean to say?

269
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,042
That the police are washing
their hands off the incident.

270
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:13,212
They've written it off as an accident.
As in the case of the other deaths.

271
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:17,622
They are not going to investigate it.
Because she is from the home you run.

272
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:35,945
lt was here just now... now it's
there... l crashed into it.

273
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,713
But who are you?

274
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,613
l'm Priya.

275
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,083
ls Prashant at home?

276
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,226
l'm a colleague.

277
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,829
l think l'll sit down.

278
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,735
And what do you do?

279
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:06,869
Just this...

280
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,271
Breaking things?

281
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,676
No! l don't do it all the time.
Just happens. Sometimes.

282
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,813
Stay seated. Don't get up.

283
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,545
What did you break, Shaloo?

284
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:18,920
You!

285
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,119
Me!

286
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,217
Your colleague.

287
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:29,355
Yes! The three girls in my office.
l told you about them.

288
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:33,265
Neeta, Rajni and Rosie.
This is Neeta.

289
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:37,239
She isn't Neeta.
She's the fourth one. Priya.

290
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:42,977
Oh, l forgot all about Priya.
How are you, Priya?

291
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,279
Let me get dressed.

292
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,878
l have to talk to him.
About work. May l...?

293
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:02,758
- Why the hell did you come here?
- lt's been three days!

294
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,932
Three days, and not a sight of you!
Not even a call!

295
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:11,006
- l was busy.
- Nonsense! l expect you at four.

296
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,608
- lf you don't come...
- What?

297
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:18,341
l'll tell Shaloo that we are in love.

298
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,441
Want me to tell her?

299
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,215
Four o'clock.

300
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,018
Sharp.

301
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:32,455
You are stubborn! And what a ploy!
To get me out of office.

302
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:41,965
Didn't l tell you Prashant is going
to be here before the coffee arrives?

303
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,073
You were born on the day
of the full moon!

304
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,903
And l met your mother on
a no-moon night!

305
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,480
What are you staring at?
Look over here.

306
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,478
The kid broke it.

307
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:59,249
And this is my son.
He's going to smash everything here.

308
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,422
Just take the order.

309
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,520
- What do you want?
- Everything.

310
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,742
Are you neighing?

311
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:22,878
l see. Not allowed here?

312
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,240
All right.
We sing after supper.

313
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,173
Lay it down.
Time to eat. Eat.

314
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,984
The baby is crying.
Give him a feed.

315
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,958
You don't ever say that
when l cry.

316
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:42,091
- Oh go on.
- Sure.

317
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:47,968
Yes, my son.
But you spoilt her mood.

318
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,874
Look at him. And you.
You're such a nerd.

319
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:58,847
- You keep running away from me.
-When l'm his age, l'll be funny too.

320
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,016
- l guess l have to something.
- About what?

321
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,582
- About giving you a lesson.
- ln what?

322
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,054
Love

323
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,720
lt was such fun!

324
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:10,557
ln the dream l was holding you.
Like this.

325
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:15,797
And the nerd that you are,
you were worse in that dream.

326
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,995
You were improving.
But now you've woken me up.

327
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,170
Nonsense.

328
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:27,543
l'm right. Time you met Daddy.
l'll fix you...

329
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:33,807
- once we get the licence.
- What licence?

330
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,717
The marriage.

331
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,219
First Shaloo's marriage.

332
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,624
Let her finish college.
Then l'll find her a good boy.

333
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:50,764
Understandable. But you should meet
my Daddy. And finalise everything.

334
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:56,166
lf he marries me off to someone,
you'll end up wringing your hands.

335
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,137
But your Daddy is such
a famous lawyer.

336
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,235
l keep wondering how l'm going to
discuss the topic with him.

337
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:07,015
You mustn't be afraid when
Daddy goes to meet you.

338
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:12,048
Tell him ''l love your daughter''.
Tell him straight.

339
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,518
Yes?

340
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:14,821
Love!

341
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,159
ls this Prashant's house?
- Yes.

342
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,996
ls Prashant at home?

343
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,103
Yes he is. Please be seated.

344
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,266
Prashant?

345
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:36,274
Welcome, sir!

346
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:43,012
No formalities. ln a way,
this house is mine too.

347
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,250
Priya is all praise for you.

348
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,186
Your sister?
- Yes.

349
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,095
What's her name?
- Shalini.

350
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,828
Commendable. You raised your sister
after your parents died.

351
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:00,830
And you've done well for yourself.
Those who brave the odds...

352
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:06,574
are examples for society.
And l like your house.

353
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:12,013
You keep your house well.

354
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:17,685
You are just the man
l wanted for my daughter.

355
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,150
l won't have Prashant
for my son-in-law.

356
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,792
l've just met him.

357
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,961
He's a nobody, pushing
a desk in a newspaper.

358
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,832
You're judging him
on the basis of his status.

359
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,266
But l have seen him
with my heart.

360
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,941
l love him so much.

361
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,148
Such poetry!

362
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:55,314
That love means nothing.
lt's the foolishness of your age.

363
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,755
You cannot force
your decision on me.

364
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,990
lt's Prashant l'm going to marry.

365
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,192
Stop talking nonsense.

366
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,797
You can't be sentimental when
you take the decision of a lifetime.

367
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,195
You have lived in such luxury.

368
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,935
l'm not going to let you do this.

369
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,171
rue, you've loved me all my life.
You've given me such a happy life!

370
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:20,549
But l just don't care!
l'll make a life with him.

371
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,782
Come what may! l can never imagine
living with anyone else!

372
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:30,491
No! You can't be so cruel!
You can't take my life away from me!

373
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,760
You'll kill me, Daddy!

374
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:41,396
Well, let me see how pretty
you look when you cry.

375
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,900
l just wanted to see
how much you love him.

376
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:54,015
By the way, l liked Prashant.

377
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,723
You can marry him.

378
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,740
So late at night!
Where have you been?

379
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:57,485
What are you up to?
You're always out of the house!

380
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:03,823
And you don't even
go to the garage!

381
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,221
Where have you been?
Tell me!

382
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:16,233
Hey! You're on a trip!
What is it? What's the stuff?

383
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,043
This! You take this!

384
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,484
Do you know what this is?
Poison! Pure poison!

385
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,363
lt can destroy a man's life!

386
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,856
lt's going to kill you!

387
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,367
l want to die!

388
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:54,109
So you know it kills!

389
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,814
And you peddle this poison!
For Uncle.

390
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,017
l'm going to die!

391
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,580
l want to die!

392
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,053
l'll kill myself!

393
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:14,695
Open! Open the door! Please!

394
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:32,913
And you peddle this poison!
For Uncle.

395
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,714
l'll kill myself!

396
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,762
You have opened my eyes!

397
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,939
He is right!

398
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:06,480
l am a sinner!
A grave sinner!

399
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,842
l'm a grave sinner!

400
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,154
You must atone.

401
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:18,793
Tau must be punished... to save
so many lives from destruction.

402
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,625
- So is your wife pregnant?
- Not yet.

403
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,461
Must be something wrong
with her stars.

404
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:32,671
Bring her over sometime.
l'll work a magic for her.

405
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,703
Yes, sir.

406
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,577
Are we celebrating something?

407
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:51,222
Kantibhai retired last year.
He had put in so many years for us.

408
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,753
So l gave Kantibhai
two acres of land.

409
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,758
That's where Kantibhai lives now.
With his children.

410
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,797
Kantibhai has written to me.
He has a grandson now.

411
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,638
Now Kantibhai's grandson
is like my own grandson.

412
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,508
So l thought, let's celebrate.

413
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,775
Uncle, you are making a big mistake.

414
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:19,419
Go away.

415
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:27,819
Go on.

416
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,326
Kantibhai knows all our secrets.

417
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,827
Someday, he will send us
to the gallows.

418
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,765
And you gave him
two acres of land!

419
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:39,497
No way!

420
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,767
When you were born...

421
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,637
did the midwife cut your brains out
instead of the umbilical cord?

422
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:54,413
You fool! Kantibhai is right here.
ln Paradise.

423
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:56,286
Paradise?

424
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:12,432
Paradise... where people go to
after l've retired them.

425
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:18,676
Their souls fly free,
liberated.

426
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:27,688
This is Kantibhai. And that's
all the land he will ever need.

427
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:32,793
He was plotting against me.
So l decided to frame him.

428
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,931
And this was Munna Kaalia.

429
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,197
The fellow must've been born
clutching a knife.

430
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:47,408
Fast with his knife.
Used to go for the guts.

431
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:53,247
Fell into bad times once.
That's when l went for his guts.

432
00:55:55,418 --> 00:56:00,253
This was Ramniklal. The lawyer.
A man of the law!

433
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:06,527
Stiff upper lip and all that.
He fought a big case against me.

434
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:09,963
Ran over by a car.

435
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:19,236
And this is our Narain. Sans his head.
You cut the head off, remember?

436
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:33,249
Someone is expected here
very soon.

437
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:37,349
Montu is retiring, isn't he?

438
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:42,630
But Montu is an old-timer, isn't he?
And he respects you.

439
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:53,875
Montu is of no use to me any longer.
His hands have begun shaking.

440
00:56:55,779 --> 00:57:00,648
This is Montu.
- Who are you?

441
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:09,022
One of Uncle's men. l have something
to tell you. About Uncle.

442
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,187
Where are you calling from?

443
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,965
At Ballard Pier.
Near the petrol pump.

444
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,790
Help! Save me! Please!
They will kill me!

445
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:48,420
Help me! For God's sake!
Do something! Please!

446
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,722
Even after so many years
with Uncle...

447
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:57,722
you don't really know him.

448
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:06,231
But you we know.
Like what times you eat...

449
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:11,745
when you shit and when you piss
. oh we know everything.

450
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:20,283
See all these men standing?
Now, they aren't here to kill you.

451
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,758
They are here to see what happens
to a man who...

452
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:28,528
turns against Uncle... what happens
to a man who turns against me.

453
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:04,824
You're so late!
And l was so scared.

454
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:09,258
And God knows what's wrong with the
lights... went out thrice today.

455
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:12,596
Shall l heat the food?
- No.

456
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,996
Why not?
- l'm not hungry.

457
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,899
Not hungry? But you never even
ate breakfast this morning.

458
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,602
l'll heat the food.
- l told you not to.

459
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:23,643
But you must eat something.
- l told you! l'm not hungry!

460
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,243
And don't you nag me!

461
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,912
Now go to bed. lt's late.

462
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,646
You were tense.
l guess l added to it.

463
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,521
Why are you tense?
- lt's nothing.

464
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:50,655
He was going to tell the police!
About Uncle!

465
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:58,038
About Uncle! He must've been mad!

466
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,902
l'll even wipe out the family
of the one who betrays me.

467
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,644
But that father of yours
did something nice.

468
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:16,656
He made only one baby.
Bullets are so expensive nowadays.

469
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,318
Give me the gun.

470
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:57,197
He was only 22 years old!
He never even saw what life is!

471
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,829
How much more will
You have me sin?

472
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,198
Enough! Too much!

473
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,474
Take me to Thee! Take me!

474
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:03,727
Praise The Lord!

475
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,137
About the Montu assassination...

476
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,013
That accident... about Montu...

477
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,449
We can't call it an accident...

478
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,056
until we have the final report

479
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:33,554
That would be a wrong report.
The police are still investigating...

480
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,160
What are you saying?
l can't hear a thing!

481
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:40,660
The police are investigating...
- Can't hear a thing.

482
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:48,408
This is Montu. He was murdered.
The investigation is still on.

483
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:51,506
How can we call it an accident?
- We're saying what it really is.

484
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:55,984
He was run over. What else?
- This wasn't an accident.

485
01:05:56,085 --> 01:06:00,920
lt's murder... l mean till such time
that the police are investigating...

486
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:06,059
l spoke to the police commissioner.
And you're going on and on! Nonsense!

487
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:11,698
What do you mean?
- Who runs this paper? You?

488
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,458
Just do your job!

489
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,912
l've been going on and on...
and you don't even look at me!

490
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:29,549
What are you staring at?
Look, l'm not going to talk to you!

491
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:32,821
Listen to me!
Why don't you listen to me!

492
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,590
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you tell me?

493
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,359
lf this is what's it like now, what's
it going to be like afterwards?!

494
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:50,234
Such legs! Had the tailor missed
a few inches, wouldn't it be fun!

495
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:45,020
lnspector sahib! Help!

496
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:00,694
What's going on?
What's all this going on?!

497
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:07,437
The first time l see a fight
right inside the police station!

498
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:12,812
So what is this all about?
- Ask him!

499
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:16,313
Ask that son of yours why l hit him!
You're the ones who helps these types!

500
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:17,850
Lock him up!

501
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:21,621
A day in there,
and he'll lose his verve!

502
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,116
You think locking me up
will serve any purpose?

503
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,385
Come to your senses!
Realise! The power you have!

504
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,497
And you are responsible
for all these killings.

505
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,228
And this won't go on for too long.
Get that?!

506
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:41,408
That hoodlum misbehaved with her.
That's why Prashant took him on.

507
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,003
Yes. That hood misbehaved with me.

508
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:49,246
l'll let him go.
On your say-so.

509
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:58,884
lf he does that again, l'll have him
jailed for a couple of months.

510
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:03,629
Sign here.

511
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:18,573
Likely at your age, Prashant.
You are likely to be reckless.

512
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:22,710
ln time, you will understand.
- l don't care!

513
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:26,118
l saw Montu being hacked to death.
With my own eyes!

514
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:32,020
Bharat Acharya killed him!
l can't forget that!

515
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:38,898
l can't face myself!
lt's killing me!

516
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,262
They called it an accident!
The file is closed!

517
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,900
lf l don't speak, Montu's death
will remain an accident.

518
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,640
l'll speak the truth!
l'll speak to the police!

519
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:55,276
That truth is going to
destroy your sister!

520
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:02,288
Time was when the truth
and the ideals stirred me.

521
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:08,320
Just like you. When l spoke of
the truth, my eyes would shine!

522
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:14,067
One day, l caught four students
copying at a test.

523
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:20,340
l was asked to spare one of them.
Because he was the chairman's son.

524
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:25,478
l refused. Because to me, the students
were all equal in my eyes.

525
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:31,784
And l was paid for my audacity.
l was thrown out of the college.

526
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:37,289
But my wife welcomed me. Like a hero.
There.. she's the one!

527
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:40,687
And now ask her! How much
she has suffered for my ideals!

528
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,190
Why, she's the living dead!

529
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,192
And look at this!

530
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:53,875
l was going to sell these books!
For medicines! For my wife!

531
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,705
No harsher the truth, is there?!

532
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,973
ls this the truth you show me?!

533
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:06,588
What use then your lessons?

534
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,982
You are the one who
taught me the morals.

535
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:16,129
Was it false?
All of it a fraud?

536
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:19,026
And if it were, what culture is ours
that teaches us these morals?

537
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:27,740
These eyes of mine...
you know these eyes, don't you?

538
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:39,182
You cannot tolerate it
any more.

539
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:46,726
But the path you travel upon,
leads through the fire.

540
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,896
Where are you going?
- l want to see Mr Deshmukh.

541
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,394
The sahib is having lunch.
You can't see him now.

542
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,498
l'll see him right now!

543
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:02,138
Prashant Verma. l'm a sub-editor.
With the New Revolution.

544
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:06,541
l have something to tell you.
lt's about a murder.

545
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,918
Which murder?

546
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,551
Montu. The man who was found dead
at Ballard Pier.

547
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,824
Bharat Acharya is the man
who killed him.

548
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:20,317
l was right there.

549
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:27,398
Do you know what it means to be
an eye-witness to a murder?

550
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:32,764
l know. l'll speak in the court.
l don't care for anyone.

551
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:40,175
l am glad to know that someone
still wants to help the police.

552
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,884
Let us proceed with
the investigations.

553
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:44,377
You will be served summons
to depose in court.

554
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,426
Deshmukh sahib on the line.

555
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:09,071
Just that?

556
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:15,574
That isn't bad news.
l'll talk to him.

557
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:20,819
Once he meets me, he will
understand everything.

558
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:28,220
What's up, Uncle?
- No dearth of fools.

559
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,259
Poor Prashant.

560
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,834
Who are you?
What are you doing?

561
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,832
Let me go!
Leave me!

562
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:50,483
So you don't like the price
l'm offering you?

563
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:56,588
Why don't you just say that
you've decided to ditch me?

564
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,628
Now l'll tell you something.
Remember this.

565
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:09,268
Make sure you trust your ears.
Else, you might get killed.

566
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:18,645
Now the game is one in which
you play your moves.

567
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,009
Make sure you keep track of
the opponent's moves as well.

568
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:03,522
How old are you?
Twenty three? Twenty four?

569
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:14,228
So you saw Montu being killed
that night?

570
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:22,837
This is a no-good city, Mr Prashant.
You mustn't go out at nights alone.

571
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,445
Why have l been brought here?

572
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:38,223
You went to Deshmukh, did you?
You want to depose in court?

573
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:45,465
Bharat Acharya is my nephew.
Uncle's nephew!

574
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,995
You've heard my name, haven't you?

575
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:59,613
Yes. l've heard so much about you.
They speak of you with such respect!

576
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:02,247
Because by day,
you are a gentleman.

577
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:09,986
But l know what you really are.
The devil incarnate!

578
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,486
Did you get paid for
this performance?

579
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:15,595
ls this any way to talk
to a gentleman?

580
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,094
Everyone in the city
respects him!

581
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,358
Not everyone. Just ones like you.

582
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,628
The ones he shares the loot with.
They are the ones who revere him.

583
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:26,602
Don't you scream!

584
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:34,247
l'll destroy your evil empire!
l'll unmask you!

585
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:49,662
He's young.
And naturally, hot in the head.

586
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:59,631
Pierce the ox in the nose, and he
will know how hard the rope bites.

587
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:12,746
You're so innocent.
You don't know who Uncle is.

588
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,290
l stand tall among men.

589
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:26,833
Look up at me in the eyes
and you will snap your neck.

590
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:06,806
Take a good look at it.
lt lies in pieces.

591
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:13,910
l just dropped it from so high up.
And you... you stand so high!

592
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,290
And what are you going to do?

593
01:19:30,565 --> 01:19:33,432
l told you
you're fired!

594
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:36,068
l haven't come begging
to be hired!

595
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:40,536
l'm here to salvage
what's left of my conscience.

596
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:44,176
l don't know whether
God will forgive you.

597
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:47,309
But l will never be able
to forgive myself for...

598
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:52,451
having worked with a man who has
always distorted the truth!

599
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:55,621
You say that! And who
do you think you are?

600
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,958
You think you can bully me?

601
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,489
l've brought the biggest of
bullies on their knees!

602
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:03,753
So who do you think you are?

603
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,756
You've always screamed me down!

604
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:15,007
Look! Look at them!
Frustrated. All of them.

605
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,608
They have made their compromise.
With their circumstances.

606
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:24,383
All they can do is mumble
when someone screams at them.

607
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,552
But all that is changed.

608
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:34,056
No more that pen which wrote
at your whim.

609
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,318
My hands are free.

610
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:39,059
And when l raise my hand
against the evil...

611
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:43,193
it's going to be
your neck first.

612
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:57,481
Well what, Mr Prashant?
Lost yourjob?

613
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:05,118
Get out of this city as fast as you
can. Else you'll lose your life.

614
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:14,500
Don't you worry about my life.
Count your blessings.

615
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,894
Your game is about over.

616
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:27,513
You give the baby to drink
when he is teething.

617
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:31,317
Chew on something hard,
and you'll break your teeth.

618
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:34,055
Mark my words!

619
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,853
bye

620
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:45,262
Don't torture yourself.
Everything is going to be all right.

621
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,995
You'll find a job.
- lt isn't about the job.

622
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:54,704
l look at myself in the mirror,
and a question haunts me.

623
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:59,845
What am l?
Who is Prashant Verma?

624
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:07,485
Ever since l was a kid,
a fear has haunted me.

625
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:14,693
And ever since my mother died
the fear has obsessed me.

626
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:21,700
l'm responsible for Shaloo.
The only thing l have in life.

627
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:28,573
l shut out my conscience.

628
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:35,145
And like all the others around me,
l sat watching...

629
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,151
while the goons ransacked this city.
lt set my blood on boil!

630
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:47,390
But then l would remember Shaloo.
To her, l am the father, the mother.

631
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:55,000
Her marriage is my responsibility.
And that has always held me back.

632
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,274
And l could look no further.

633
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:09,278
And how the fear
corrupted my mind!

634
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:13,319
That is why l wrote
those saleable articles.

635
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,859
All l sold all day,
was rape and murder.

636
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,987
At the end of the day, l sat down
to eat the meal l earned.

637
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:28,634
l would see Shaloo eat,
and l would forget...

638
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:30,632
what l sold for a living.

639
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:40,006
And by and by,
l became a sub-editor.

640
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:48,545
l sold whatever l was told to.
And l saw how the truth was coloured.

641
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:52,449
And lies were true!
And those who professed the truth...

642
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:58,564
were in fact the bedmates
of the likes of Uncle!

643
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,199
They dance to his tune.

644
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:11,205
And all l did was sit and watch.
l just sat over there. And l watched.

645
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:19,152
l got myself used to watching.
So much so that...

646
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:24,482
l stood watching Montu being killed.
Killed mercilessly!

647
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:29,461
They killed him right
in front of my eyes!

648
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:35,567
And l! He looked into my eyes!
He asked me to help him! And l!

649
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:41,573
l cannot forget it!
l cannot!

650
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:49,214
And he published it as an accident!
A murder! As an accident!

651
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:56,981
Because Bharat Acharya
is Uncle's nephew!

652
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,892
l am ashamed of myself!

653
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:07,900
l have decided to expose the truth.

654
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:14,197
l can't keep quiet anymore.
Enough is enough!

655
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:20,076
l'm not going to let this die down.
l'll stay here. ln this city!

656
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:23,707
No matter what it costs me!

657
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:33,224
l am trying to awaken
the man inside me.

658
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:37,262
Maybe he is alive...?

659
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:01,217
lf he is left alive, he will
depose in court, won't he?

660
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:03,051
Let's kill him.

661
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:05,688
You don't understand
anything but violence?

662
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,451
As if you haven't made
enough trouble?

663
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:11,597
The matter about that girl isn't over.
And you want to kill a journalist!

664
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:21,274
l'll get sacked.
- Deshmukh is right.

665
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:25,038
Worse, it might hurt
Bharat's political image.

666
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:29,144
Better to obfuscate
the issue. Legally.

667
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,687
What did you do?

668
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:43,962
You touched my collar!
You touched Uncle's collar!

669
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:54,734
Throw him out!

670
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:05,084
He set my blood on boil!
When he talked back at me!

671
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,882
Scare him to death!
That is if you won't kill him.

672
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:19,094
He will cool down once he sees
the colour of his own blood.

673
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:48,627
You are Uncle's men.
l know you!

674
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,221
Don't run away!
Face me if you dare!

675
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,291
lt's late in the night.
Come back tomorrow morning.

676
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:56,895
l don't have time till tomorrow.

677
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,969
Why don't you understand?
The sahib is asleep. l told you.

678
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:01,803
Wake him up.
Else l will.

679
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:05,307
Deputy Commissioner Deshmukh!
Come on out!

680
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:09,348
What is the matter?
Why are you screaming?

681
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:13,084
Look! This is what l get
for helping the police!

682
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:18,149
Uncle's men! They attacked me!
The cowards!

683
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:20,625
Come to the office tomorrow.
We'll talk.

684
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:24,730
Talk to you!
But l know what you are!

685
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:29,359
You've sold out to Uncle.
Just like the others.

686
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:31,998
That's the truth about you!

687
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:41,740
See this? Blood? This isn't blood.
lt's acid. Every drop of it a revolt!

688
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:45,247
And the wound you have
given me bleeds!

689
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:48,420
This is the blood
of the common man!

690
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:52,319
And when the blood flows,
destinies will be changed.

691
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:34,601
Weren't you supposed
to be back early?

692
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:39,003
Well...
- Work! Of course!

693
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:42,135
You must finish the game
before supper.

694
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,640
l've left the coins
just as they were.

695
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,008
Come on.

696
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:49,280
You see...
- No excuses!

697
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:54,087
Now l know why l lose all the time.
Every time l'm about to win...

698
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:56,816
you leave the game unfinished.
We'll see today.

699
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:00,689
Do you think you'll win?
- Absolutely!

700
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:03,925
Think it over.
- Let's play.

701
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,304
You didn't move the coins, did you?

702
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,206
Whose strike was it?
- Mine.

703
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:24,144
Mine.
- So you remember?

704
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,886
Very well.

705
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:46,966
What is that?

706
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:50,566
Blood! What happened?!

707
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:55,947
lt's nothing. Just a nail.
Beside the seat in the bus.

708
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:58,115
l've seen the doctor.
- You're all right, aren't you?

709
01:30:58,386 --> 01:30:59,080
Of course.

710
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,456
Then swear it by me.
You got hurt in the bus?

711
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:06,983
You're out of your mind.
Making me swear all the time.

712
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:08,489
Forget it.
lt's nothing.

713
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:12,764
lt's your blood!
Not nothing!

714
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:16,601
Now come on. l'm hungry.
Heat the food.

715
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:27,107
Oh! l forgot to tell you something!
.

716
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:32,084
l went shopping today.
Look at this. How do l look?

717
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:33,845
Fine.

718
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,619
Just fine?

719
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:45,255
Why are you so grumpy?
Laugh a little. Smile a bit.

720
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,262
How about sweet nothings?

721
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:50,401
What is there to say?

722
01:31:53,174 --> 01:32:00,671
Things like this keep happening.
Life is full of problems.

723
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:06,785
Here l am sitting beside you.
Don't you feel a thing?

724
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:11,186
lsn't there something
you'd like to do?

725
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:16,419
Like what?

726
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:17,790
Like this!

727
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:19,263
What are you doing?!

728
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:23,159
So you're looking for more?

729
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:30,033
Shut your eyes. And don't open
your eyes till l tell you.

730
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:35,543
All right.
You can look.

731
01:39:04,538 --> 01:39:07,268
Just give me a bit of time.
l'll fix everything.

732
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:14,338
That upstart! A pissant!
He wants to confront me!

733
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:19,551
And you and your police!

734
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:22,986
And what do you want?
l have a job to do!

735
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:31,024
Oh no. You won't lose yourjob.
But Prashant has a sister.

736
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:36,234
His weak point. What remains
to be seen is whether...

737
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:40,471
the truth means more to him
than his sister.

738
01:39:41,008 --> 01:39:47,004
How right you are!
Grandpa used to say...

739
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:50,612
grab the snake at the mouth.

740
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:19,538
Open the door!

741
01:40:19,913 --> 01:40:22,279
What is the matter?
- Have you seen Shaloo?

742
01:40:22,549 --> 01:40:24,039
No! l didn't see anything!

743
01:40:27,054 --> 01:40:29,522
What is it?
- Have you seen Shaloo?

744
01:40:29,923 --> 01:40:32,551
l'm just back from work.
l don't know anything.

745
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:38,429
Have you seen Shaloo?
- No. l didn't see her.

746
01:40:38,832 --> 01:40:41,733
My pad is smashed up!
lt's just down the corridor!

747
01:40:41,835 --> 01:40:43,826
And you say you didn't see!
- l didn't see anything.

748
01:40:44,571 --> 01:40:47,734
Now let me go to sleep.
- These people are the living dead.

749
01:40:47,841 --> 01:40:51,072
Uncle's men were here.
They took your sister away.

750
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:59,375
Long live Uncle!

751
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:04,883
l don't like this adulation.

752
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:10,529
l am just a simple humble man.

753
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:16,396
You know all about Lord Ram.

754
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:24,634
And all l have to say is that
Lord Ram didn't live in vain.

755
01:41:27,047 --> 01:41:32,815
One must know about Lord Ram.
And one must try to be like him.

756
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:39,423
lmbibe the principles he lived by.

757
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:46,831
And then this play about Lord Ram
will bear fruit.

758
01:41:48,969 --> 01:41:50,834
Else, it's useless.

759
01:41:54,641 --> 01:42:01,137
Nowadays, we hear about things
that have come from Britain.

760
01:42:01,548 --> 01:42:04,540
And about things being
sent off to Britain.

761
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:10,287
Does anyone think which way
lndia is headed?

762
01:42:10,824 --> 01:42:13,315
Where are gone those golden days
when Lord Ram reigned?

763
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:19,726
Don't you speak of Lord Ram!
You're worse than the devil!

764
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:24,199
Where is my sister? Tell me!
You kidnapped my sister!

765
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:25,335
Stop him!

766
01:42:35,115 --> 01:42:37,106
How dare you!

767
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:44,283
Stop this fellow!
Stop him!

768
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:52,291
Where is my sister?!
Tell me!

769
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:55,900
l won't spare you!
My sister! Give her back to me!

770
01:43:00,407 --> 01:43:02,136
Give my sister back!

771
01:43:03,043 --> 01:43:04,670
Take that animal away!

772
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:07,106
Where is my sister?!

773
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:12,644
You kidnapped my sister!

774
01:43:12,753 --> 01:43:14,482
l won't spare him!

775
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:18,650
Leave me!

776
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:22,154
Lock him up!

777
01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:13,972
Have you seen the real
face of the law?

778
01:44:16,116 --> 01:44:20,951
For me, the law is a plaything.

779
01:44:23,624 --> 01:44:26,491
But l haven't settled
scores with you.

780
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:35,061
You made a spectacle of me in public.
Made a spectacle of Uncle!

781
01:44:36,336 --> 01:44:38,827
This you will pay for.

782
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:45,834
Your sister.

783
01:44:50,017 --> 01:44:51,484
No. l won't kill her.

784
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:57,721
But after l'm through with her,
she will hate her own life.

785
01:44:58,659 --> 01:45:00,889
She won't have
any wish to live.

786
01:45:03,664 --> 01:45:11,298
By the way, l'm bailing you out.
Surely, you want to see your sister?

787
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:23,706
Let me go!
Please! Let me go!

788
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:34,625
l can't, can l?

789
01:45:36,129 --> 01:45:40,998
l'm so sorry for you.

790
01:45:41,368 --> 01:45:47,637
But what can l do?
You are Prashant's sister.

791
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:54,637
He grabbed me by the scruff
of my neck! ln public!

792
01:45:57,584 --> 01:46:06,083
l could have hacked him to pieces.
But that would be too less a price.

793
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:13,530
He loves you very much.

794
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:20,638
So let me deck you up like a doll
before l send you to him.

795
01:46:21,808 --> 01:46:26,677
He will shiver when he sees you.

796
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:35,519
Send a letter to Prashant.
Write it on her skin.

797
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:41,291
He wants to see his sister
married, doesn't he?

798
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:44,595
Brand her.

799
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:56,231
l am for sale.

800
01:46:57,577 --> 01:46:59,943
l am a whore.

801
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:08,084
Play with me.

802
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:37,779
She has been tortured so much
that she has turned numb.

803
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:43,779
She does not hear.
She does not speak.

804
01:47:44,724 --> 01:47:46,589
She doesn't react at all.

805
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:47,849
Take a look.

806
01:48:05,879 --> 01:48:08,109
What's wrong, Shaloo?

807
01:48:11,418 --> 01:48:14,876
Doctor, what's wrong with my sister?

808
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:18,652
Say something, Shaloo.

809
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:22,417
Why doesn't she say anything?

810
01:48:22,796 --> 01:48:25,788
Say something, Shaloo.
Say something.

811
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:27,489
Speak!

812
01:48:45,418 --> 01:48:49,548
She is in deep shock.
The poor thing is out of her senses.

813
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:55,426
Now that you are here... well,
she might respond to you.

814
01:48:59,432 --> 01:49:05,667
Everything is going to be all right.
l'll set everything all right.

815
01:49:07,173 --> 01:49:14,306
Don't you worry. Here l am.
Your brother is with you.

816
01:49:15,849 --> 01:49:20,843
Say something, Shaloo.
why don't you say something?

817
01:49:21,855 --> 01:49:26,690
Say something.
Anything.

818
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:29,387
Why don't you speak, Shaloo?

819
01:49:31,765 --> 01:49:36,634
Say something, Shaloo.

820
01:49:57,457 --> 01:49:59,186
l have been paid for my deeds.

821
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:04,189
My sister has been consigned
to the living dead.

822
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:12,971
You said the truth will destroy
my sister! You were right.

823
01:50:14,975 --> 01:50:16,203
She is destroyed!

824
01:50:18,845 --> 01:50:24,112
l stood by the truth.
And my sister paid for it.

825
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:33,016
l can fight no more. l'll go away
with Shaloo. Someplace far.

826
01:50:38,164 --> 01:50:44,103
No matter how she is,
at least she is alive.

827
01:50:47,007 --> 01:50:49,134
Get a hold on yourself, Prashant.

828
01:50:50,377 --> 01:50:52,345
Please buy these medicines.

829
01:51:06,292 --> 01:51:11,161
No. You must fight.

830
01:51:12,932 --> 01:51:16,060
You mustn't forsake the truth

831
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:21,563
The truth hasn't destroyed me.

832
01:51:22,308 --> 01:51:25,038
l won't be the cause
of your weakness.

833
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:29,141
l can't go on living.
lt will prove...

834
01:51:29,382 --> 01:51:35,548
that the truth has destroyed me.
l won't let that happen.

835
01:54:49,549 --> 01:54:50,174
Here you are.

836
01:54:51,851 --> 01:54:59,348
An innocent. Just 18 years.
l tortured her so!

837
01:54:59,592 --> 01:55:04,461
l am responsible for her death!
l am the one!

838
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:10,100
Kill a woman, and you kill
a hundred mothers!

839
01:55:11,104 --> 01:55:13,732
My time is surely up!

840
01:56:02,055 --> 01:56:06,890
Now l know why
You don't want to kill me!

841
01:56:08,661 --> 01:56:11,027
l am not a sinner at all!

842
01:56:12,432 --> 01:56:14,900
Life and death!
lt's all in Thy hands!

843
01:56:16,169 --> 01:56:20,037
You are the cause of what happens.
You are the cause of what will happen!

844
01:56:20,306 --> 01:56:22,035
And l'm no sinner!

845
01:56:23,142 --> 01:56:26,009
Praise The Lord!

846
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:52,494
Why do you take the chance?
What if someday...?

847
01:56:56,009 --> 01:57:02,278
Grandpa used to tell me
what makes a first rate scoundrel.

848
01:57:05,718 --> 01:57:11,179
You are such a moron!
But l'm not one.

849
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:17,327
The bullet is a dud.

850
01:57:25,204 --> 01:57:29,573
You sister took a lot of time
to burn on the pyre.

851
01:57:31,077 --> 01:57:32,840
She was divine.

852
01:57:33,846 --> 01:57:37,976
The divinity resisted the flames.

853
01:57:38,785 --> 01:57:39,877
Take this.

854
01:57:42,255 --> 01:57:48,592
The power within you
is liberated.

855
01:57:48,961 --> 01:57:51,953
Your weakness have been
burnt away.

856
01:57:52,198 --> 01:57:55,326
Now you are
the angel of death.

857
01:57:55,601 --> 01:57:58,229
Destruction!

858
01:58:01,074 --> 01:58:09,573
ln your eyes, l see the destruction!
The divine light fills your eyes!

859
01:58:12,618 --> 01:58:18,750
l cannot be mistaken.
l know that light.

860
01:58:21,761 --> 01:58:26,630
l know. l sit by the fires
all night.

861
01:58:27,266 --> 01:58:28,995
Go then.

862
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:34,137
Kill the sinners!
Burn them to ashes!

863
01:58:35,174 --> 01:58:36,903
Apocalypse!

864
01:59:57,356 --> 01:59:59,221
Happy birthday, Uncle.

865
02:00:06,365 --> 02:00:07,730
Congratulations, Uncle.

866
02:00:09,202 --> 02:00:16,335
So what says the stars?
How is the year for me?

867
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:26,118
Not a good one for you.
Mars is malefic for you.

868
02:00:27,019 --> 02:00:29,988
Could mean grave harm.

869
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:33,019
Even death.

870
02:00:36,028 --> 02:00:38,258
And how about your horoscope?

871
02:00:39,432 --> 02:00:42,299
How many years does it give you?

872
02:00:43,769 --> 02:00:51,266
Ninety years. 37 years to go.

873
02:00:51,644 --> 02:00:53,271
Really?

874
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:57,614
Give it to me.

875
02:01:10,663 --> 02:01:13,655
He was going to live
another 37 years.

876
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:21,435
God must have made a mistake.
Anyway, his 37 years are now mine.

877
02:01:23,309 --> 02:01:28,178
l'll come over to fetch you.
Oh you must come.

878
02:01:28,581 --> 02:01:31,812
We've put together such
a party for you.

879
02:01:34,353 --> 02:01:37,083
The Swami is coming
to the party tonight.

880
02:08:56,395 --> 02:08:58,761
Surprised to see me here?

881
02:08:59,932 --> 02:09:04,801
But you have forced me
to do all this.

882
02:09:06,772 --> 02:09:12,904
You should know the sharpness
of the blade you have forged.

883
02:09:14,246 --> 02:09:15,372
Stop.

884
02:09:19,151 --> 02:09:21,016
For the first time
in my life...

885
02:09:21,286 --> 02:09:23,880
someone has dared to raise
his head against me.

886
02:09:25,791 --> 02:09:33,027
Everyone should know the result
of shouting in my face.

887
02:09:34,299 --> 02:09:39,168
l stand on your seat.
And l tell your men.

888
02:09:40,072 --> 02:09:42,836
l will strip you
before your time.

889
02:09:42,941 --> 02:09:47,810
And everyone will know
what Uncle is. An animal.

890
02:09:53,852 --> 02:09:58,687
Laugh as much as you can.
This is the last you will laugh.

891
02:09:58,991 --> 02:10:03,189
You will never laugh again.
l promise.

892
02:10:45,604 --> 02:10:46,969
Hurts, does it?

893
02:10:49,074 --> 02:10:55,070
Fire. You will get to know the fire
only when you touch the fire.

894
02:10:57,349 --> 02:11:02,218
l hurt and hurt till l went numbed.
Now l don't feel a thing.

895
02:11:03,388 --> 02:11:06,357
l give you your first
feeling of pain.

896
02:11:34,453 --> 02:11:35,920
Get out of here.

897
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:58,068
Prashant, what are you doing?

898
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:18,558
Are you out of your mind?

899
02:12:25,737 --> 02:12:27,364
What are you doing?

900
02:12:28,106 --> 02:12:32,008
The 25th anniversary of
The New Revolution, isn't it?

901
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:33,475
l'm celebrating.

902
02:12:34,346 --> 02:12:40,478
For 25 years, all this newspaper
has published are lies.

903
02:12:41,753 --> 02:12:45,883
This newspaper has sheltered
so many criminals.

904
02:12:46,258 --> 02:12:49,591
Remember what l told you?

905
02:12:50,495 --> 02:12:57,992
When l raise my hand, the first neck
is going to be yours.

906
02:13:14,553 --> 02:13:15,520
What are you doing?

907
02:13:15,921 --> 02:13:17,388
You can start working.
Right from tomorrow.

908
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:23,651
The press is yours!
The paper is yours!

909
02:13:24,796 --> 02:13:26,525
this chair is yours!

910
02:13:26,932 --> 02:13:28,991
Everything is yours!

911
02:13:29,501 --> 02:13:35,337
What are you going to do?!

912
02:15:44,603 --> 02:15:45,831
Where is Lalla?

913
02:15:47,339 --> 02:15:48,465
Up there.

914
02:15:54,613 --> 02:15:56,478
You're worrying for nothing.

915
02:15:56,848 --> 02:15:59,976
This is the training you get
in the home for destitutes.

916
02:16:00,452 --> 02:16:03,615
Bharat sent you to me.
For training.

917
02:18:02,941 --> 02:18:03,669
What are you doing?!

918
02:18:05,543 --> 02:18:08,034
Let me go!

919
02:19:13,178 --> 02:19:15,009
Lalla is dead.

920
02:19:15,246 --> 02:19:16,611
Who the hell is this?

921
02:19:17,115 --> 02:19:18,605
Your nemesis.

922
02:19:19,150 --> 02:19:23,610
Pandey is gone. Now Lalla.
Your cookie is crumbling.

923
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:29,288
You'll have time
to mourn for more.

924
02:19:29,561 --> 02:19:32,928
Come your turn, there will be
none left to mourn you.

925
02:19:33,164 --> 02:19:36,531
lt will be a municipal funeral
for you.

926
02:19:42,907 --> 02:19:49,142
Prashant has killed Lalla.
He has thrown me the gauntlet.

927
02:19:50,415 --> 02:19:58,186
- He challenges Uncle!
- Not to worry, Uncle.

928
02:19:59,090 --> 02:20:02,924
Prashant has bought his ticket.

929
02:20:04,596 --> 02:20:12,230
l have hired a foreigner to do
the job. He's an assassin.

930
02:22:02,614 --> 02:22:05,845
Bravo!

931
02:22:18,029 --> 02:22:25,162
Whites are whites after all.
They love imported stuff in lndia!

932
02:22:25,403 --> 02:22:27,394
lmported.

933
02:22:31,543 --> 02:22:36,412
lt isn't going to be difficult
to contain Prashant.

934
02:22:38,316 --> 02:22:43,185
Why don't you understand Priya?
l don't have these lovely dreams.

935
02:22:43,454 --> 02:22:46,082
l live in a world of
death and terror.

936
02:22:46,457 --> 02:22:49,688
There's no coming back for me.

937
02:22:50,461 --> 02:22:55,330
But all this violence! lt's the job
of the police and the law.

938
02:22:56,100 --> 02:23:00,969
Were it not for the law,
l wouldn't be doing all this.

939
02:23:01,739 --> 02:23:04,367
And l have to do the needful.

940
02:23:05,109 --> 02:23:09,068
And you will become
just like one of them.

941
02:23:09,747 --> 02:23:12,079
- What about your conscience?
- My conscience is dead!

942
02:23:15,219 --> 02:23:21,556
This is notjust a vendetta.
For me, it is the goal of my life.

943
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:25,852
But l don't want all this!
l can't live without you!

944
02:23:26,631 --> 02:23:33,867
Why me? Deep down inside, l am dead.
l have seen so much destruction.

945
02:23:34,739 --> 02:23:39,608
Now l must destroy the ones
who are responsible.

946
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:46,109
There must have been many more
like my sister.

947
02:23:46,618 --> 02:23:49,382
But they had no one
who would fight for them.

948
02:23:49,487 --> 02:23:51,352
Look at the city.

949
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:54,517
Take a good look at this city.

950
02:23:55,126 --> 02:23:59,995
For the many families which have been
destroyed, l will put up my fight.

951
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:05,128
Don't cry, Priya.
For my sake!

952
02:24:05,503 --> 02:24:09,496
For a man, the woman
is a symbol of power.

953
02:24:09,907 --> 02:24:13,035
Must you make me weak?

954
02:24:13,645 --> 02:24:18,139
Forget me. Like a dream.

955
02:27:44,322 --> 02:27:48,315
We pay our taxes.
The landlord collects our taxes.

956
02:27:52,196 --> 02:27:55,825
You told us we'd get licenses
to run the shops, didn't you?

957
02:27:56,467 --> 02:27:59,197
Ask your landlord
that question.

958
02:28:00,538 --> 02:28:01,835
Evict him.

959
02:28:12,450 --> 02:28:15,351
Dare you stare at me!
l'll gouge your eyes out!

960
02:28:19,624 --> 02:28:23,253
Do you know this map?

961
02:28:25,129 --> 02:28:26,494
What do you mean?

962
02:28:27,598 --> 02:28:29,463
The Motherland.

963
02:28:31,235 --> 02:28:37,105
Look at her. She curses herself.
She is ashamed.

964
02:28:41,245 --> 02:28:47,377
Know why? Because she has given birth
to scoundrels like you.

965
02:28:48,886 --> 02:28:49,978
Let the police do its job.

966
02:28:50,388 --> 02:28:53,516
You needn't work anymore.
Time you retired.

967
02:29:29,927 --> 02:29:34,296
You don't have any right
to touch that statue.

968
02:29:34,565 --> 02:29:37,557
You don't even have the right
to touch this soil.

969
02:29:39,570 --> 02:29:41,435
You have desecrated this soil!

970
02:29:46,577 --> 02:29:51,446
Please! Don't kill my Daddy!

971
02:29:53,451 --> 02:29:58,912
l won't make your son an orphan.

972
02:29:59,457 --> 02:30:04,656
l know what it means
to be an orphan.

973
02:30:05,062 --> 02:30:08,554
lf you have any morals left,
you will atone.

974
02:30:12,970 --> 02:30:17,703
You might repay the debt
of your mother's milk.

975
02:30:27,518 --> 02:30:30,385
But you are an evil man, Daddy!

976
02:30:30,888 --> 02:30:33,755
l told you l wanted to
become a soldier.

977
02:30:34,125 --> 02:30:36,753
lf you're so bad,
what will a soldier be?

978
02:30:37,128 --> 02:30:41,497
l won't become a soldier!
Never!

979
02:30:48,773 --> 02:30:52,504
The law has caught up with you.
l will have to arrest you.

980
02:30:52,877 --> 02:30:53,901
My crime?

981
02:30:54,412 --> 02:30:56,812
Arson at The New Revolution.
And Lalla's murder.

982
02:30:57,314 --> 02:30:59,179
Have you any evidence?

983
02:31:00,484 --> 02:31:01,951
No.

984
02:31:03,821 --> 02:31:08,155
But today, you assaulted
a police officer on duty.

985
02:31:11,062 --> 02:31:12,927
You cannot arrest Prashant.

986
02:31:14,298 --> 02:31:18,359
Till l make a complaint,
you don't have a case.

987
02:31:18,569 --> 02:31:19,866
What are you saying?

988
02:31:20,438 --> 02:31:23,566
Prashant did not assault me.
l fell down.

989
02:31:26,143 --> 02:31:27,906
ln fact, he helped me up.

990
02:31:28,612 --> 02:31:30,671
He's going from one crime
to another!

991
02:31:30,981 --> 02:31:32,972
lf you complain, we can arrest him.

992
02:31:34,518 --> 02:31:38,545
You cannot arrest me, Deshmukh.
No one can arrest me till...

993
02:31:38,789 --> 02:31:42,691
l wipe Uncle out.

994
02:31:43,294 --> 02:31:46,286
You are making a grave mistake by
taking the law in your hands.

995
02:31:47,865 --> 02:31:50,095
l have seen enough of the law.

996
02:31:51,402 --> 02:31:54,769
The case against Uncle is personal.
lt has nothing to do with the police.

997
02:31:55,573 --> 02:32:00,875
Till he is convicted, the police
is bound to protect him.

998
02:32:03,147 --> 02:32:06,583
No matter how much
you try to protect him...

999
02:32:06,884 --> 02:32:11,412
he is going to die at my hands.

1000
02:32:11,689 --> 02:32:15,750
After l have killed Uncle,
l will turn myself in.

1001
02:32:19,296 --> 02:32:21,696
l had to let go of a criminal
because of you!

1002
02:32:21,799 --> 02:32:24,290
What a shame!

1003
02:32:24,702 --> 02:32:28,001
No, sir. The shame is what was
going on all this time.

1004
02:32:28,205 --> 02:32:30,935
What a shame that
while in uniform...

1005
02:32:31,142 --> 02:32:34,805
we serve someone like Uncle.
lt's an insult to the uniform!

1006
02:32:55,099 --> 02:33:03,302
You know, l like to keep the best
of the girls for myself.

1007
02:33:36,440 --> 02:33:37,600
What do you want?

1008
02:35:13,570 --> 02:35:14,935
Kill him!

1009
02:35:57,314 --> 02:36:02,183
Look in their eyes.
And you will see hatred.

1010
02:36:05,456 --> 02:36:10,291
You aren't my enemy.
To these women, you are.

1011
02:36:12,062 --> 02:36:16,692
No. Don't be afraid of me.
You should be afraid of these women.

1012
02:36:18,135 --> 02:36:22,572
You have preyed upon them.
They will punish you.

1013
02:36:48,699 --> 02:36:50,428
Forgive me!

1014
02:37:55,432 --> 02:37:56,990
Who?

1015
02:37:57,935 --> 02:38:00,870
Your nephew is dead.

1016
02:38:04,174 --> 02:38:09,043
You bought the law out. And you've
managed to stay out of the courts.

1017
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:13,811
Soon you will stand in my court.

1018
02:38:16,286 --> 02:38:20,450
l am going to be the lawyer.
The witness. And the judge.

1019
02:38:20,691 --> 02:38:22,591
And l'll also play the hangman.

1020
02:38:42,479 --> 02:38:46,916
Stand in his court!
He has gone mad!

1021
02:38:47,017 --> 02:38:51,249
He wants to kill me!
Wants to kill Uncle!

1022
02:38:53,390 --> 02:38:56,120
lt's a bad time for him.

1023
02:38:58,195 --> 02:39:00,629
Poor fellow.

1024
02:39:00,998 --> 02:39:02,863
He will never dare
to come here.

1025
02:39:10,908 --> 02:39:14,708
He will come.
He has to.

1026
02:39:15,212 --> 02:39:20,081
lt is here that
he will die.

1027
02:39:21,051 --> 02:39:22,450
He is here.

1028
02:39:23,854 --> 02:39:25,219
Who?

1029
02:39:25,722 --> 02:39:29,021
lt's me. The assassin said
he will come later.

1030
02:39:30,561 --> 02:39:37,990
Bring him over. Right away.
l'll tell him how to kill Prashant!

1031
02:42:26,069 --> 02:42:30,529
Finish him off!
Kill him!

1032
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:32,198
Destroy him.

1033
02:44:46,977 --> 02:44:53,541
Not one more step!
l'll shoot!

1034
02:45:41,031 --> 02:45:45,900
l only set it right.
l still have to break it.

1035
02:45:53,043 --> 02:45:57,912
Count your sins.
You have little time left.

1036
02:49:22,852 --> 02:49:24,444
Open the gates!

1037
02:49:25,455 --> 02:49:28,322
Deshmukh sahib! l'm Uncle!

1038
02:49:30,093 --> 02:49:31,526
What's up?
lt's late!

1039
02:49:31,961 --> 02:49:33,189
Open up!

1040
02:49:33,563 --> 02:49:36,293
- The sahib is asleep.
- l must speak to him! lt's urgent!

1041
02:49:36,633 --> 02:49:42,196
You aren't even dressed properly!
Go away!

1042
02:49:42,572 --> 02:49:44,938
- Open up!
- l won't!

1043
02:49:45,842 --> 02:49:47,503
Who is it over there?

1044
02:49:48,945 --> 02:49:52,676
Some fellow. Comes with
a broken face. After a fight.

1045
02:49:52,882 --> 02:49:55,783
He isn't even dressed properly!
And he says he's your Uncle!

1046
02:49:56,886 --> 02:49:59,616
Deshmukh sahib! l'm Uncle! Uncle!

1047
02:50:00,924 --> 02:50:02,152
Let him in.

1048
02:50:08,431 --> 02:50:13,300
Deshmukh sahib! Save me!

1049
02:50:19,642 --> 02:50:23,305
He is after my life!
That Prashant!

1050
02:50:23,947 --> 02:50:27,246
He even fixed my neck!
Look!

1051
02:50:27,850 --> 02:50:31,479
Please! Arrest me!
lt will save my life!

1052
02:50:31,854 --> 02:50:33,754
l can fight in the courts.

1053
02:50:37,727 --> 02:50:43,859
So Prashant did what no doctor
in the world could do!

1054
02:50:46,436 --> 02:50:48,597
You have straightened out at last.

1055
02:58:50,052 --> 02:58:51,781
l'll wait for you.
