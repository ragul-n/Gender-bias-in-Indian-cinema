1
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,933
Pulse rate, heart beat, BP,
everything is going down,

2
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,798
it's impossible for him to survive.

3
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:22,104
Though we are giving electric shock,
there's no response from his side.

4
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:25,410
He's not dying, we'll die.
- How come?

5
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:26,779
We got him admitted thinking
he'll get better,

6
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:29,786
but even after 28 years no change.
He's still in coma.

7
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:31,355
Looking at his background,

8
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:35,052
l'm scared to think of the
consequences of his death.

9
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:38,925
Shift him to govt. hospital saying
equipment is not working here,

10
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,865
arrange for police security
and then inform his relatives.

11
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:54,269
Lord! Bless that atleast this
marriage proposal gets through.

12
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:55,381
Please take your seat.

13
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:58,384
Why are you looking up?
Sofa is down here.

14
00:03:58,552 --> 00:03:59,951
Admiring the beautiful home.

15
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,148
House will be fine, servant will
be fine, and grandma will be fine,

16
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,054
your future son-in-law will be fine,

17
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,457
if your time is good,
you'll also be fine.

18
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:12,063
Greetings.- Greetings madam.
- Please sit down.

19
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:13,358
Are you fine?

20
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:14,827
Where is Srimannarayana?

21
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:17,128
He went out after
getting a phone call.

22
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,870
Phone call at this hour?

23
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:26,842
From where?

24
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,376
He's coming, go fast.

25
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:35,050
Go!

26
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:43,390
That's bus stop, go fast.

27
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:45,360
l said l like you, she said yuck,

28
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,728
l said l love you, she spat at me.

29
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:49,458
They are catching up, go fast.

30
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,500
Why is she so proud?

31
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:53,570
She's beautiful, isn't she buddy?

32
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,638
Go...go...

33
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,901
Let's disfigure her beauty.

34
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:01,905
They are coming...go fast.

35
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,442
Open the door! Who are you?

36
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:10,436
Will you hire a goon to beat me?

37
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:16,379
l've decided to disfigure your beauty
even if you sleep with me now.

38
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:22,879
We are on other duty.

39
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:29,520
Stop it!

40
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:33,262
Stop it l say!

41
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,834
That's not acid,
it's just cool drink. lt's chilled.

42
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:39,597
Just thought of acid
is making you scream,

43
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:43,004
they are girls, think of their condition
if acid is thrown at them.

44
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,370
think about their future,

45
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,843
won't you think of killing anyone
throwing acid on your sister?

46
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,244
You must also be killed, right?

47
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:53,846
Chase beautiful girls, tease them,

48
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,080
till they enjoy it,
comment till they don't get hurt,

49
00:07:57,257 --> 00:08:00,420
love them, give your life to save
it if they say yes,

50
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:04,085
what's this throwing acid
saying you love her?

51
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,588
lf you do it again...

52
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,759
Go...go away...

53
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:17,769
lf anyone tells you l love you
and threaten to throw acid,

54
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:19,103
cut it off.

55
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,778
l'll take care it.

56
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:33,454
Come.

57
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,467
Where am l?

58
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:46,332
Yes sir.

59
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:48,440
A patient in coma for 28 years,

60
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:50,803
a patient whose pulse rate and
heart beat went down,

61
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,877
almost brain dead man,

62
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:54,638
did he come to sense
with just one punch?

63
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,711
His punch has power
which is beyond science.

64
00:08:58,918 --> 00:08:59,816
Who is he?

65
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:10,519
Society has become very worse.
- Yes.

66
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:12,824
lt has become terrible for
girls to venture out.

67
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,489
Throwing acid, slitting throats...

68
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,635
Are girls any less?

69
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,863
lf they wear minis and micro minis...

70
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,007
What else can boys do
other than throwing acid?

71
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:27,375
Wrong!
The mistake is not in the dress.

72
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:31,039
Mindset of the men must change.

73
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:34,243
Will you throw acid if girls wear
minis and micro minis?

74
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,012
Why did you argue with him?

75
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,388
Come father...come.

76
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,856
Who are they?

77
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,133
This is known as getting bill
for unused phone.

78
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:51,361
They are bride's family.

79
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:54,267
You should've told me that.
- You never gave us that chance.

80
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,137
Don't know when you'll get interested
in romance forgetting the violence?

81
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:01,474
Grandma is sad, console her.

82
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:11,485
What's this grandma?
Worried that brides' people left?

83
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:14,650
lf we miss this,
we may get another proposal,

84
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:18,059
but l told you so many times
to stay out of trouble,

85
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,960
yet you come home
with blood stains.

86
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,931
l can't be a mute
spectator of injustice...

87
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,070
Yet you mustn't interfere.

88
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:28,570
You mustn't interfere.

89
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,904
Okay, l will stay away.
l'm hungry, grandma.

90
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:35,073
Come.

91
00:10:40,853 --> 00:10:43,651
This proposal too failed, brother?

92
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:49,924
Look brother, you don't get proposals
as we software people get,

93
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:52,963
farm or wife, set up when there's boom,

94
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:57,034
your youth boom is waning,
her age boom is waning,

95
00:10:57,203 --> 00:11:00,695
you'll never enjoy the
bliss of married life.

96
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,432
You too.

97
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:04,710
You eat brother. l think it's idly.

98
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:07,210
Have a go at it?
Anyway you can't marry.

99
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:11,945
Here!

100
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,419
What happened?

101
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,713
For your nasty comments,
he just tapped you with his hand.

102
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,447
Just tapped?
Had he slapped?

103
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:20,683
You would've been broken into pieces.

104
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,625
Why are you so proud?

105
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:26,959
When software was in boom,
banks gave you loans,

106
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,862
you build these homes with it,

107
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,558
you bought cars,

108
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:32,796
you got yourselves wives
with 100 acres farm,

109
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:34,303
software boom is over,

110
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:36,032
cars have been seized by bankers,

111
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,733
father-in-law is protecting your homes,

112
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:40,311
you're living by selling an acre from
the farm brought by your wife,

113
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,846
living a destitute life,
you're getting kicked here.

114
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:45,244
Let boom go to hell,

115
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,613
if you want to stay alive,
stay away from my boss.

116
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:49,721
He himself doesn't know when
he'll laugh and when he'll beat.

117
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:50,686
How do you manage him then?

118
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,415
That's why l'm always outside.

119
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,617
Boss is here!
- He's here!

120
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,994
That's better! Fear him like that.

121
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:07,434
You're new to this college,
you're Mayor's son,

122
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:13,603
like in most films, Mayor's son
will be arrogant as expected.

123
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,841
Now l've given you a memo.
You'll tear it.

124
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:20,008
This is also expected.

125
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,520
Think if l take action on you.

126
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:27,489
Your father will take action on me.
That is also expected.

127
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,857
l can't get dirtied by your sins,
so l'm sparing you,

128
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,691
that is also expected,

129
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:36,631
but there's an unexpected thing here.

130
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:46,706
Name of the unexpected thing
is Srimannarayana.

131
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:17,069
lf the complaint goes
to his table by mistake,

132
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:20,804
you'll get shredded more finely
than what you did just now.

133
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,347
You mean he'll beat me?

134
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:28,481
You're class, that's why asking,
will he beat me?

135
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,781
But he's man of masses.

136
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:34,757
To tell you in local lingo,
your ass will get busted.

137
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,322
Come to me with hundred mistakes,

138
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,267
but don't ever face him even with
the thought of committing a mistake.

139
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:56,942
Eat!

140
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:03,285
l've a doubt,
why do you like madam so much?

141
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,117
Few like white...
- Excellent!

142
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,123
Few like black...
- Great!

143
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,529
Let me finish it.
- Hold on boys.

144
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:15,394
Few like white, few like black,

145
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:16,398
but l like Mahi,

146
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:19,299
if you ask me why, l can't tell.

147
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:21,940
You're Sanskrit, madam is English,

148
00:14:22,074 --> 00:14:24,907
you both are east and west,
how can these two meet?

149
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:28,241
l feel we'll the best
if east and west unite.

150
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:29,972
l've an idea sir.
- Tell me.

151
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,308
On seeing madam,

152
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,147
in the corridor,

153
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:39,748
slipping on the floor,
sitting on your knees,

154
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,154
if you present her a rose flower...

155
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:45,088
He barely reaches her hip
when standing,

156
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,766
if he kneels down,
he'll be this much in the centre.

157
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,492
He's short...

158
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:52,804
Stop talking about my height,
tell me some hi-tech idea.

159
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,575
Two dilkhush.
- No stock sir.

160
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:58,403
No stock, let's discuss tomorrow.

161
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:01,012
l'll get it from outside.
Please sit down, tell me the idea.

162
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,877
Tell her, when l saw you first time...
- ...saw you first time...

163
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,884
Wait sir, it must come out
from deep inside.- ls it gas?

164
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:10,784
When l saw you first time,
l lost my heart,

165
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:13,790
second time when l saw you,
l lost my hands,

166
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,451
third time when l saw you,
l lost my legs,

167
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,722
fourth time when l saw you,
l lost everything.

168
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:21,332
lf everything is lost,
why would she look at him?

169
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,991
ls he Hrithik Roshan?
He's just Venkatrathnam.

170
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:25,797
Sanskrit sir, madam is coming.

171
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:29,533
Madam is coming.

172
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:51,555
l may come slipping like this only.

173
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:54,063
What's this sir?
You're on high.

174
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:58,067
Youth is like that now.
- How?

175
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:02,674
lf possible few words,
if it's okay, a cup of coffee.

176
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:06,676
Think about coffee later; tell me
those few words you told about.

177
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,742
That's all?

178
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:12,581
That's all.

179
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:27,259
This is what you call
inviting trouble yourself.

180
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:29,628
l was waiting for you only.

181
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:32,930
But Sanskrit was boring me
with his banter.

182
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,797
Am l bantering?

183
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,405
ls he talking sweet?

184
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:38,543
What's the matter?

185
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:43,341
lt seems you saw a proposal.
- lt's routine.

186
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:47,944
What's your program this weekend?
- Nothing.

187
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,179
Come to my home for dinner.

188
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,450
Your coming.

189
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,317
ls he also invited?

190
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:56,893
What do you say sir?

191
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:02,032
He's busy with a TV soap opera
from 6 pm to 10 pm,- Me?

192
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,466
if he misses an episode,
he may not follow it properly.

193
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:07,231
Moreover he's on diet.

194
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,068
You need dieting not me.

195
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:21,983
Just words for me and
good dinners for him.

196
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,649
Don't know what would happen there?

197
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:38,100
Please come in.

198
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,844
Closed the door so fast.

199
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,777
You look very beautiful in this dress.

200
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:59,354
Shall l open it?

201
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:01,850
Open?

202
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:05,060
Anyone would say thanks
if someone says dress is beautiful,

203
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:07,961

as in Sanskrit,

204
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:10,034
why is she asking can l open?

205
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:13,364
You've to open it anyway,
so why not now itself?

206
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,240
l'm not able to open it,
you please do it.

207
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,709
Just a small knot, pull it,
it'll open easily. Pull it.

208
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,708
He's Rama outside and Krishna inside.

209
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:25,874
How nicely he's playing the flute.

210
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:27,147
How is it?

211
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:31,120
l expected it'll be good,
didn't expect it'll be so beautiful.

212
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:39,057
ltems are sensational.
Shall we start?

213
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,721
Will you start?

214
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,629
l think you rush too fast.

215
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:46,932
Never delay when its hot.
Just have a go at it. Come.

216
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,904
Just a minute and
he's making her scream.

217
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,239
l'm scared of darkness.

218
00:18:55,881 --> 00:19:00,750
You say scared of darkness
and hugged the transformer.

219
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:10,093
l don't mind not seeing the video,
l can't hear this audio.

220
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,761
l can't take it anymore.

221
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,770
Food was great.

222
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,773
The man marrying is very lucky.

223
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,950
Who else it would be? lt's you!

224
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,519
Lion like young man is on prowl...

225

Touching something here...

230
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:38,278
He's raising the heat and

He's studying physics

00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:44,576
He's mixing chemistry
in the body...

237
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:56,183
l'll read psychology in your beauty...

238
00:21:56,362 --> 00:22:00,196
l'll show you my technology
in the darkness...

239
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:04,427
He's a scholar of love
and romance...

00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:08,505
l'll teach you the
art of intimacy and abusing...

242
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:09,999
He wants to put his
autograph of bliss on me...

243
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:14,663
He wants to write my biography

Visakhapatnam

00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:38,220
Tell me, where are they?

251
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,085
l told you l don't know.

252
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:42,758
Leave my man.

253
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:04,877
Do you know now?

254
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,813
l know...some college
in Hyderabad...

255
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:07,917
But l don't know which college...

256
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:10,782
lt seems some college
in Hyderabad, search boys.

257
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:18,162
How long will it take?
- Some more time sir.

258
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,130
Get it ready and come to
the campus, l'm going.- Okay sir.

259
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:09,343
What are you looking at?
- Book.

260
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:12,382
Not the book,
l know where you were looking.

261
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:18,480
What's this? How many more
passengers will you take?

262
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:21,956
This is share auto, if we don't take
as many as possible, it'll not work out.

263
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:24,357
You take passengers
but don't crush us.

264
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,160
They fall when speed raises
or brake is applied,

265
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,800
they'll fall on us even
if turns the steering.

266
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:32,027
Getting full value for
the Rs.3 they pay.

267
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:33,865
Read.

268
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,550
Good respect in the campus.

269
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:02,631
Couldn't get her despite
trying so many times.

270
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:05,202
Try this time, she'll fall for you.

271
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,762
A man is harassing me.

272
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,909
Harassment in this college?

273
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:15,405
Hey who are you?
- He's finished.

274
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:18,746
ls it him?- No.
- ls it him?

275
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:21,412
That man!
- That...

276
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:26,914
Don't beat him black and blue.

277
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:29,251
Just few punches are enough.

278
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,598
l think he's a goon.

279
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,834
l'm new student.
- l know it.

280
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,439
You must increase the campus security.

281
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,542
This is unexpected. Why?

282
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:48,805
A man has entered the campus
and harassing me, sir.

283
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:50,777
Who is he?

284
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,219
This is also unexpected.

285
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,379
He's the security of this college.

286
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:00,286
Name is Srimannarayana.

287
00:28:01,593 --> 00:28:05,461
He's the first man to
help anyone in distress.

288
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:08,461
When l speak about him...

289
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,739
She's Janaki, she left BlTS-Pilani
and joined here.

290
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:34,325
You don't appear like a professor.

291
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:39,494
l saw book only.

292
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:43,834
What did he see?

293
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:46,998
By the way who are you?
Attender?

294
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:50,301
Do you go by appearances?

295
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:52,204
Any youth is not a college student,

296
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:54,174
any fair man is not a professor,

297
00:28:54,346 --> 00:28:57,645
there are many brilliant lecturers
who are short and dark.

298
00:28:57,816 --> 00:28:58,840
Like me!

299
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:03,884
By the way, what did he see?
- Book.

300
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:05,421
Which book?

301
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:14,055
He saw your book only
but he booked my life.

302
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:18,396
You must book him someway
to keep tied to you.

303
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,901
l know you've understood it,

304
00:29:20,072 --> 00:29:22,905
l've understood that
you've understood it,

305
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:25,567
l know you can do it.

306
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:33,216
What's this?

307
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:35,377
Go away!

308
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,517
l'm asking you what's that?
Why are you pointing at me?

309
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:39,554
l told you to go.

310
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:44,218
Weren't you last year's college topper?
- Yes sir.

311
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:46,427
What's that?
- Nothing sir.

312
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,361
What's that?
- l don't know anything sir.

313
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:49,898
What's that?
- l don't know anything sir.

314
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:54,664
That is...room No:6...Vicky sir...
l don't know anything sir.

315
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:22,127
What's this?
What are you doing here?

316
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,996
Are you doing this in college
instead of studying?

317
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:28,639
What's this?
What the hell are you doing here?

318
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:33,376
Why are you beating us?
ls it college or elementary school?

319
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:42,619
Elementary school?

320
00:30:43,388 --> 00:30:47,791
Sent you to study in college..
you want drugs...

321
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,118
Are you coming to college for this?

322
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:51,227
Why are you beating us?

323
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:54,160
Not just beat you,
l'll cut you to pieces.

324
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,405
Hey, he's beating me!

325
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:10,548
He has come.

326
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:13,149
Young boys...you need drugs.

327
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:27,195
Go! Why are you staring at me?

328
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:30,823
Go! Come with your father.
Go!

329
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:55,693
ls it him?
- Yes.

330
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:57,451
Why did you beat him?

331
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:59,927
What is he to you?
- Nothing.

332
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:04,866
What is he to you?
- Nothing.

333
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:09,533
Why are you beating us?

334
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:18,043
Oh my God!

335
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,311
Why did you come without
any relationship with him?

336
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:28,286
We've to answer to his parents only.
Not to you.

337
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:31,892
Go....go!

338
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:36,662
Sir, he's beating us saying
we are not his parents.

339
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:40,236
This is not a good college,
they are behaving differently here.

340
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:42,999
He's beating us like school kids.

341
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,156
ls this campus yours?

342
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:12,427
Once if l decide it's mine,
l don't know how far l'll go.

343
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,372
Your son has committed a mistake
here, warn him not to do it.

344
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:18,600
lf he...
- ...does it again?

345
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:20,166
Will you beat Mayor's son also?

346
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:21,970
l mustn't speak like this,

347
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:24,707
Bastard! l'll strip and beat him.

348
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:30,447
When l speak only your ears
must pay attention.

349
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:34,456
lf any other sense pays attention,
you'll not celebrate next birthday.

350
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,889
There may be hundreds of
rules for traffic on roads,

351
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:41,465
there's only on rule in this campus,
l'll say and you'll listen.

352
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:43,966
Listen!

353
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:47,104
lf l beat you son, it may hurt you,

354
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:50,401
if he spoils my students,
it hurts me here,

355
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:53,066
if l get hurt here,

356
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:56,740
l'll follow grammar only
when teaching lessons,

357
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:58,974
l'll not follow it
when l beat someone.

358
00:33:59,184 --> 00:34:03,917
l don't know myself where l'll start
and where l'll end it.

359
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:05,488
Black and blue!

360
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:08,318
Mother, father, Guru and God, they say,

361
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:10,085
you failed as mother and father,

362
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,752
l'm doing it as Guru,

363
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,990
if l fail then, it's up to God then.

364
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:20,671
Decide what you want son or his memories,
and then send him to college tomorrow,

365
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:22,671
Go.

366
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:24,337
Go!

367
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:48,361
Not a serious injury, right?
- No, l'll take care of it.

368
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:58,367
Your attitude to help others
despite facing danger is good.

369
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:04,578
What's the matter?

370
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:08,708
l got admission and scholarship
in Oxford University, sir.

371
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:14,387
Your encouragement made
it possible, sir.

372
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:19,296
l'm going abroad, so a small party
to keep in touch with friends,

373
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:22,295
you must definitely make it, sir.
- No please.

374
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,968
How can you say no sir?
- He's refusing, right?

375
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:28,401
What will he do there?
Teach or beat up someone?

376
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,501
lf someone like me comes there,
l can dance and sing.

377
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:36,078
Yes, you're the right choice,
carry on.

378
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,929
Who is she?
- My student, grandma.

379
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:02,436
Greetings.

380
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,336
How did you get hurt?

381
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:08,103
ln college campus...
- Her scooty skid and she fell down.

382
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:13,445
Girls must be very careful, dear.
- Okay.

383
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:17,444
Will you tell lies?

384
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:20,054
Grandma is scared of violence.

385
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:22,455
l'm seeing you smile for
the first time, sir.

386
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:26,291
l'm a professor in college,
outside the campus l'm just normal.

387
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:28,796
Can l move freely with you, then?

388
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:46,075
How is your wound now?
- Healed.

389
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,485
Do you always read books only?

390
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:51,984
That day too..
- ...you saw book only.

391
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,441
How come you're here?
- Came with friends.

392
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:49,169
Once if l decide it's mine,
l don't know how far l'll go.

393
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:10,061
l'll use drugs or do anything,
what bothers you?

394
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:14,103
You instigated professor against me,
why would l leave you?

395
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,068
Stop!

396
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,377
Stop...where are you running away?

397
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,419
Come...come...

398
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:41,588
How dare you hold my
sister-in-law's hand, bloody?

399
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:45,601
Sister-in-law, brother wants you,
get into the jeep.

400
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:51,935
l think sister-in-law is feeling shy,
stop her.

401
00:39:21,005 --> 00:39:23,235
How dare you touch my brother's wife?

402
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:28,805
l'll rip out your skin.

403
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:30,839
Give a try.

404
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,277
You'll die if you don't leave her.

405
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,647
l told you to try.
- What should l try?

406
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,191
Take Vicky to the hospital.

407
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:31,868
Who are they?

408
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,044
They are saying brother, sister-in-law,
you're his wife.

409
00:40:38,116 --> 00:40:39,208
What's the matter?

410
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:40,984
We are from Vizag.

411
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:46,557
My father is Jagadish Prasad.

412
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:52,725
My brother is Anand Prasad.

413
00:40:54,665 --> 00:41:02,071
My father had few problems with
a man known as Gopi in business.

414
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:42,946
A patient who was in coma for 28 years
regained consciousness,

415
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:52,614
got a message from Veera Kesavulu
to my father to meet him.

416
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:57,422
lt's better to keep Gopi under control.

417
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:01,128
Don't you feel it's strange?

418
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:04,131
Starting from my feet,

419
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:06,599
settling on my son's head,

420
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:11,197
you're asking me to keep
my son under control.

421
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:16,145
One going up must crush another,
it's not wrong,

422
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:19,583
crush a stone, not a mountain.

423
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:23,153
You thought l'll die in coma.

424
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:25,352
That's why you reached top.

425
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:29,827
Now that l'm back, quit.

426
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:33,657
lt's difficult for you to
be my henchman.

427
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:37,927
Do one thing, your daughter is
of marriageable age now,

428
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:40,002
give her in marriage to my son,

429
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:44,167
live here as my kinsman.

430
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:51,681
Tell her marriage is better than death.

431
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:56,179
l was called home from Pilani.

432
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:59,349
How can l marry him, daddy?

433
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:04,626
lf it's normal we both can decide,

434
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:09,290
a third person above us
has already decided it.

435
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:11,367
What can the old man do to us, father?

436
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:16,298
Who do you think he is?

437
00:43:16,474 --> 00:43:19,238
lf we agree, it'll be marriage here,

438
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,039
if not, not a soul ill be here
to conduct obsequies too.

439
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:27,550
We had to accept their order in fear.

440
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:51,006
You didn't imagine this
in dream also, right?

441
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:56,007
You wanted my head at any cost.

442
00:43:57,348 --> 00:43:59,680
You got my legs, wash it clean.

443
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,985
Sprinkle it on your head,
it'll cleanse you.

444
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:11,353
Greetings.

445
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:14,089
Are the arrangements okay?
- Excellent boss.

446
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:17,530
Brother is great in groom's dress.

447
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:21,297
lt's my marriage, have a blast.

448
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:23,440
Boss, joker is here.

449
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:24,830
ln card game.

450
00:44:25,743 --> 00:44:31,204
You got it in card game, but this joker
will come at my beck and call.

451
00:44:31,782 --> 00:44:33,443
Come here brother-in-law.

452
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:42,289
Do you know what do they call
a person hiding behind a woman?

453
00:44:42,827 --> 00:44:44,454
Eunuch!

454
00:44:49,734 --> 00:44:52,828
Stop...stop...
- He killed my son.

455
00:44:53,004 --> 00:44:54,562
We can't o anything,
they've come prepared.

456
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:57,139
Kill everyone of them.

457
00:45:00,778 --> 00:45:06,148
My father sent me away before
l could see my dead brother.

458
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:08,751
But those rogues...

459
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:13,481
Everyone knows she's my wife, father.

460
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:19,088
l'll not let them live.
l'll kill them, father.

461
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:25,395
Killing others is not victory to us.
We must defeat them.

462
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,639
He showed his power by
taking away his daughter.

463
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:36,512
Bring back your wife and
show him your power.

464
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:46,285
From then on l'm living every
second in the fear of them.

465
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:49,119
Don't worry about anyone
from this moment,

466
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:54,629
if they dare to touch you, they must
have the courage to behead me first.

467
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:01,202
There's a party today evening, right?

468
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:20,546
This is not campus, continue.

469
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:23,392
You too join them and enjoy.

470
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,567
Can you dance?

471
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:39,073
l asked can you dance?

472
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:27,221
Do you've heart?

473
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:29,188
Do you've courage?

474
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,157
Do you've pep?

475
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:33,626
Do you've grip?

476
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:39,333
Do you know beat?

477
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,334
Do you've heat?

478
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:43,405
Do you've date?

479
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:45,269
Do you've that mate?

480
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:49,401

481
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,482
l'll give you the rhythm of lips...

482
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:04,317
Tempo is upbeat...
you may get drowned...

483
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:08,390
We've hit the right chord...
l must give myself to you...

484
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,586
l had tequila but no kick in it...

485
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:15,732
Because of your looks...

486
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,665
My words are pepper..

487
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,599
My dance is hot chilly...

488
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:24,764
My body is giving shocks today...

489
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:28,776
Your gesture is dashing...
your lips are ravishing...

490
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:34,077
Your dance is sensational...
l'm finished...

491
00:50:10,187 --> 00:50:14,089
l'm your disco jockey...
you're my Kawasaki...

492
00:50:14,224 --> 00:50:18,058
Touch and make me lose out...
let's soar into sky...

493
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:22,063
May l rock the clouds?
May l give shivers to the stars?

494
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:25,828
May l fly into the sky?

495
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:30,203
Roaming with Sun...
dreaming with moon...

496
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:34,400
l'm intoxicated with
the romance of gaming...

497
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:36,409
Chasing the stars...

498
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,514
Browsing in the sky...

499
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:40,513
Falling with that feeling...

500
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,482
Let's come back to earth
again with it...

501
00:51:01,872 --> 00:51:03,703
Open the gate, Bill gates is here.

502
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:08,004
lf you don't open in a minute,
you'll face it, open!

503
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:11,608
What's wrong with you, idiot?

504
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:13,249
Kicking me? l'll take you to task.

505
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,511
Are you so proud?
Don't you want us to live around here?

506
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:18,848
Beat him!
- Will you beat me?

507
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:27,020
l'll also join you.
- Will you beat us? Beat him...

508
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:32,259
Stop...stop...
why are you beating him?

509
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:33,936
What's the reason for woman handling?

510
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:36,538
l'll tell you.
Girl, come out.

511
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:39,137
Who is she?

512
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:40,208
That's what we are also asking you.

513
00:51:40,377 --> 00:51:42,402
You've a beautiful wife
yet brought a concubine,

514
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:43,238
that's why we beat you.

515
00:51:43,414 --> 00:51:47,646
Don't hesitate, give him
another coating, it'll last for long.

516
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:49,376
Come on women!
- Wait...wait...

517
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:51,714
She's my husband's sister.

518
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:57,753
My sister....my sister.

519
00:51:57,928 --> 00:52:00,158
Check our blood will be red.

520
00:52:00,297 --> 00:52:03,664
Understood?
You can clear out now.

521
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:06,064
Go...
- Bye...go now.

522
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:09,634
Though we don't have children,
you've created a good sister.

523
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:12,002
l've the answer for that.

524
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:16,135
She's his student,
she'll stay with you only.

525
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,610
Though your boom has waned,
you still have the pride, right?

526
00:52:18,782 --> 00:52:19,749
That's why this.

527
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:22,150
What's my position in my home now?

528
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:23,753
The sofa you bought in boom
is in verandah, right?

529
00:52:23,921 --> 00:52:25,855
On that...?

530
00:52:26,023 --> 00:52:28,321
Can l send signals of whistles
or gestures to my wife?

531
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:30,425
You mustn't toy with that idea.

532
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:32,687
lf you do, women will beat you up.

533
00:52:32,863 --> 00:52:34,922
lf you whistle, police will beat you.

534
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:37,089
l think it's better to keep it
off the police.

535
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:38,165
Police?

536
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:41,060
l've given you a lot of trouble.

537
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:45,436
No need to say sorry but
made a great fool proof plan.

538
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,772
Your problem is solved.
Come l'll take you to grandma.

539
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:51,938
Grandma.
- Coming.

540
00:52:54,618 --> 00:52:55,778
Greetings grandma.

541
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:05,084
Hostel is not convenient to her,
so she's a paying guest with our neighbour.

542
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:08,720
You've come while offering prayers,
you're very lucky.

543
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:10,058
Take it.

544
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:15,896
You're native of?
- Bangalore, grandma.

545
00:53:16,073 --> 00:53:18,132
What does your father do?

546
00:53:19,977 --> 00:53:22,969
l'll get you coffee.
- l'll also come with you, grandma.

547
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:25,571
Did l manage it well?

548
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:31,515
Excuse me brother, a small doubt.
- Go ahead.

549
00:53:31,688 --> 00:53:36,022
She eats there, but stays here,

550
00:53:36,193 --> 00:53:38,661
she sleeps there but spend day here,

551
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:41,093
why all this?
lf you bring her here...

552
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:42,823
You can do it yourself.

553
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,167
You'll accept.

554
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:46,996
Say yes.

555
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:51,870
ls my house a massage centre to you?

556
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:57,780
lf l don't get it, boom of
my nerves will wane.

557
00:53:57,948 --> 00:54:00,314
l'll not leave this matter.
- What will you do?

558
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,850
l'll not say, look there!

559
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:07,822
lt seems Sri has taken the
new girl to his next door.

560
00:54:07,991 --> 00:54:09,515
What about you then?

561
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:14,296
l've a master plan.
- What's that?

562
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,695
You mean...will you rape him?

563
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:26,375
Next week we both are going
to Delhi for AlCTE meeting.

564
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:27,532
So what?

565
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:31,203
We'll stay there in the same hotel.

566
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:46,561
This is my plan.
- ls it?

567
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:50,694
Then, l'll stay with
my batch mate's room.

568
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:54,166
How can you?
We've to discuss all the night.

569
00:54:55,205 --> 00:54:58,572
l mean...you may not
feel comfortable...

570
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:02,076
She's doing all this for that,
why would she feel uncomfortable?

571
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:03,712
Did you say something now, master?

572
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,008
l just said when sex desire takes you,
there's no fear or shame.

573
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:11,382
Master is studying Sanskrit.
You carry on, it's quite interesting.

574
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:16,390
lf women meet,
do they discuss such things?

575
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:20,428
We'll freshen in the room
and go to the restaurant.

576
00:55:21,064 --> 00:55:22,861
l'll offer him wine.

577
00:55:23,867 --> 00:55:25,425
Do you drink too?

578
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:33,706
How nice it would be if it rains then?

579
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:37,769
l'm sweating out here
and you want effects.

580
00:55:38,215 --> 00:55:42,777
lf you don't sleep on the bed,
it's an insult to me.

581
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:47,986
l've the habit of putting my leg
on my partner in sleep.

582
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:49,352
ls it okay to you?

583
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:51,657
He'll bear any weight.

584
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:54,126
l don't mind if it's
comfortable to you.

585
00:55:55,565 --> 00:56:00,468
Finished! What will be left after
getting together under the rug?

586
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:04,129
lt's song of romance there,
it's song of tears here.

587
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:14,641
lt's not a festival today, grandma?
What's all this?

588
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:19,983
This is not a festival celebrated by all,
it's restricted to this home only.

589
00:56:20,157 --> 00:56:24,150
Our family deity Lord Lakshminarasimha
Swamy's marriage.

590
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:31,994
Sorry grandma, mother is calling.
Will be back in a minute.

591
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:35,994
Mother...- How are you dear?
- l'm fine, how are you?

592
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,670
No change, same fear and
same horrible life.

593
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:44,679
You're not facing any problem, right?
- No mother.

594
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:49,012
l'm a paying guest next
to a good man's house.

595
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:51,687
When he's near me,
l'll be safe, mother.

596
00:56:52,556 --> 00:56:53,750
Who is he?

597
00:56:53,924 --> 00:56:56,358
Srimannarayana, my professor.

598
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:01,024
l'll call you later, mother.

599
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:05,026
Grandma...grandma...

600
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:08,436
What happened, grandma?
Grandma!

601
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,225
Who beat you?

602
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:40,730
Do you know atleast his name?

603
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:44,069
Brother, we saw sister-in-law.

604
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:46,732
What?
- We saw sister-in-law.

605
00:57:48,645 --> 00:57:51,239
Where?
- ln Ameerpet.

606
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:30,214
Your grandma is very depressed.

607
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:33,889
Last year same day she fell
unconscious like this only.

608
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:40,121
A person getting hospitalised for
the same reason on the same day...

609
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:45,057
She doesn't have the strength
to bear another shock.

610
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:57,411
What's it grandma?
- Take me home.

611
00:58:57,581 --> 00:58:59,811
l must offer prayers.
- Your health is...

612
00:58:59,983 --> 00:59:02,349
l must offer prayers and feed poor.

613
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:05,511
Okay grandma, everything will
go on as you say.

614
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:07,657
You take out the vehicle.

615
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,327
Hit the vehicle, so what?

616
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:21,330
l hit you, so what?

617
00:59:35,785 --> 00:59:37,343
Take the vehicle.

618
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:44,017
What for we are here?
Why are you picking up trouble?

619
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:47,029
Boss, he's unconscious.

620
00:59:56,306 --> 00:59:58,399
His bone too is broken.

621
00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:01,874
Don't know who he is but he's
beating up your men similarly.

622
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:04,638
What? What did you say now?

623
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:05,975
What did you say now?

624
01:00:06,149 --> 01:00:09,209
He beat him also like the
men he beat earlier.

625
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:15,888
l left him after almost having him.

626
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:18,152
l left him after almost having him.

627
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:20,057
l left him!

628
01:00:49,592 --> 01:00:50,422
Grandma!

629
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:57,828
Grandma, offerings.
- Keep it there.

630
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:15,782
Everything is ready grandma,
guests will be arriving now.

631
01:01:15,952 --> 01:01:18,443
l'll change and come.

632
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:21,622
Please take holy water.

633
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:38,406
He escaped from me.

634
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:42,103
He managed to give me a slip.

635
01:01:42,278 --> 01:01:45,304
Brother, l forgot to tell you a thing.

636
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:48,084
What is it?

637
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:50,811
l cut a man's hand for holding
sister-in-law's hand.

638
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:57,324
Bloody! Such important matter,
are you telling me so late?

639
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:03,323
Search all the hospitals.

640
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:06,594
l must find that creep.

641
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,340
That's BT brinjal.
- l'll have it.

642
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:24,386
You've cooked such a sumptuous food
at this age, this is unexpected.

643
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:26,920
No sir, Janaki prepared the food.

644
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:30,524
Though she lives in next house,
she helps my grandma a lot.

645
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:33,291
You always invite us on this day
only for a feast every year,

646
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:35,363
is it any special day?

647
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:40,662
lt gives me immense happiness
to feed atleast 10 guests.

648
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:43,465
Every year we expect this feast.

649
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,665
When will you invite us
for marriage feast?

650
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:48,106
Grandma has all rights over it.

651
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:50,143
l'll marry any girl she selects.

652
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:53,407
Why are you delaying?
Select a girl quickly.

653
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:56,984
He must get a perfect
choice of girl, right?

654
01:02:57,187 --> 01:02:58,950
Can't he get a bride?

655
01:02:59,155 --> 01:03:01,146
You've to say just yes,
won't she marry him?

656
01:03:01,324 --> 01:03:02,222
What do you say?

657
01:03:02,926 --> 01:03:07,158
Eat without fixing matches,
it is hurting me.

658
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,527
Not fixing, how can a debonair
like him can't get a girl?

659
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,099
Useless guys are getting married.

660
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:14,600
Please don't mind me,
she's your wife, isn't she?

661
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:16,932
No, my neighbour's wife,
l invited her for lunch.

662
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:19,267
What the hell you're asking?
She's my boom wife.

663
01:03:19,442 --> 01:03:23,503
When he can find such a beautiful girl,
how can he not a girl?

664
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,580
Please allow them to
eat peacefully, sir.

665
01:03:25,748 --> 01:03:28,911
Don't debate about my marriage.
Please leave me alone.

666
01:03:29,085 --> 01:03:29,915
You carry on.

667
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:33,522
He's feeling shy on mentioning
about marriage.

668
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:43,759
When Goddess Lakshmi is in your home
in a silk sari, don't need anyone else.

669
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:45,759
Don't you like her?

670
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:50,763
Don't know what's her idea?
We can't decide ourselves.

671
01:03:51,908 --> 01:03:53,000
Sit down dear.

672
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:57,639
Though you came at the end of the
lunch, your cooking is excellent.

673
01:03:57,814 --> 01:04:00,442
Shall we wash the hands?
- Okay.- Get up.

674
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:08,614
l think she likes her and
he too likes her.

675
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:12,124
This couple is expected,
what about you?

676
01:04:12,395 --> 01:04:18,459
100 people apply for ajob
but only one gets selected.

677
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:20,297
This is also like that only.

678
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:28,301
Good!

679
01:04:29,012 --> 01:04:31,173
Every one in this world love Taj Mahal,

680
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:32,314
because there's only one,

681
01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:35,474
though there are so many girls,
why are you after her only?

682
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:36,676
Who will l get?

683
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:39,083
Lord Venkateshwara had two wives,

684
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:40,256
Lord Shiva has two wives,

685
01:04:40,423 --> 01:04:41,754
don't know how many wives
Lord Krishna has,

686
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:44,359
let them come and make a try now,
they'll not get even one,

687
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:47,587
our country has just 6 girls for 10 boys,

688
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:49,163
l mean 60 girls for 100 boys,

689
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:50,663
600 girls for 1000 boys,

690
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:53,961
most of the girls in
that select NRl's only,

691
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:58,870
some fall for software guys, some for
film heroes, some for cricketers,

692
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:00,942
when guys like me make a try,

693
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:03,545
they ask about height,
weight, complexion,

694
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:07,444
latest fad is 6 pack,
8 pack, and 12 pack,

695
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:11,781
mine is family pack,
so if l leave her now,

696
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:16,449
l'll miss for ever,
l'll become a eunuch.

697
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:24,590
You go dear, l'll arrange it.
- l'm not a guest, grandma.

698
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:29,637
Are your people finding groom for you?

699
01:05:29,806 --> 01:05:32,138
What's your opinion
about me, grandma?

700
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:35,140
You're like Goddess of Wealth.

701
01:05:35,345 --> 01:05:40,339
But people wish Goddess of Wealth
to be in their home only, right?

702
01:05:40,516 --> 01:05:43,542
Will you be in this home only, dear?

703
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:48,214
l couldn't stop myself from
asking you this.

704
01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:50,222
Only if you like it.

705
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:54,653
l like it, that's why l'm hanging
around here.

706
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:57,095
Had he shown the interest on me
that he has on books,

707
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:59,235
l would've been his wife long back.

708
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:03,572
Couldn't you see it until
l wore a sari on festive day?

709
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:07,103
ls tomorrow auspicious day?

710
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:12,237
Don't be in a hurry,
let me tell him also.

711
01:06:17,287 --> 01:06:20,085
Grandma, everything went
off well, right?

712
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:23,115
l want to tell you something.

713
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:25,090
Any one is coming with
marriage proposal?

714
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:29,595
No need of it. Bride is here only.
- Who?

715
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:33,030
l like her.

716
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:35,762
You too have a good opinion about her.

717
01:06:36,072 --> 01:06:38,097
She likes you very much.

718
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:41,072
Forget about likes and dislikes,
she's my student,

719
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,268
what would people say about it?

720
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:44,106
What bloody student?

721
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,113
lf that's an hurdle,
l'll quit studies this moment.

722
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:49,843
Grandma, l'm not attending
college from tomorrow.

723
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:53,113
l'll spend day with you in kitchen,
night with him in bed room,

724
01:06:53,289 --> 01:06:57,123
just in 9 months,
l'll present you with his replica.

725
01:06:58,528 --> 01:06:59,961
Grandma, out.

726
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,633
He knows she's in Hyderabad.
He's there only.

727
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:11,733
At what time the Hyderabad
flight leaves?

728
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,314
His name is Srimannarayana.

729
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:23,918
He's my professor.
The girl's name is Janaki.

730
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:25,019
My classmate.

731
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:28,589
He lives in Ameerpet.
l don't know anything else.

732
01:08:51,707 --> 01:08:53,800
Stop!
Beat me now!

733
01:08:53,976 --> 01:08:54,943
Come!

734
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:51,640
Hey stop!

735
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:26,014
Go inside! Go!

736
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:00,935
Stop Srimannarayana!

737
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:27,797
You spared the man who
tried to kill you, who is he?

738
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:30,300
How are we connected?

739
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,900
Your silence is not an answer, grandma.

740
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:39,807
Will you tell me or
shall get to know it myself?

741
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:30,425
30 years ago, around Bobbili region,

742
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:32,863
no government's writ ruled,

743
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:35,534
a family ruled the region,

744
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:44,308
business, seeds, fertilizers,
everything belonged to them,

745
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,281
even if it's adulterated,
people have to take it silently,

746
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:50,713
if they dare to open the mouth...

747
01:16:50,886 --> 01:16:53,377
You say the insects didn't perish,

748
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,889
but your son died, right?

749
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:59,655
All the contracts went to them only.

750
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:04,227
lf anyone dares to defy them...

751
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:12,064
Take salary at the month end,

752
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:14,801
if you want to get pregnant,
marry someone,

753
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:18,446
if you want happiness,
take lovers like me,

754
01:17:18,614 --> 01:17:20,809
why do you want to work sincerely?

755
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:21,573
Leave me.

756
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:26,084
They stooped so low to sell
adulterated milk food too,

757
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:29,916
it took 60 children's lives,

758
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:37,330
affected parents went to police.

759
01:17:37,499 --> 01:17:39,763
Do justice to us.

760
01:17:39,935 --> 01:17:41,368
Stop! What's it?

761
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:44,301
We lost our children to the adulterated
milk food of Veera Kesavulu.

762
01:17:44,473 --> 01:17:45,997
They are dead, look at them.

763
01:17:46,175 --> 01:17:47,836
How are they connected with adulteration?

764
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:49,510
Accusing them for anything
happening here,

765
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:50,702
throw them out.

766
01:17:50,846 --> 01:17:52,677
Clear out...move...

767
01:17:52,815 --> 01:17:57,377
For the sin of going to police,
they surrounded the entire village...

768
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:04,120
Please don't kill him!

769
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:09,790
How dare you go to the police station!

770
01:18:20,175 --> 01:18:22,973
No sir...no sir...
- Sir, please spare him.

771
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:27,648
No sir please...

772
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:31,976
No man must survive.

773
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:52,898
lf you say this to anyone,
now you've lost your husbands only,

774
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:58,011
this time...
- You must live till then, right?

775
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:03,206
There's no man here
to sleep with you,

776
01:19:03,385 --> 01:19:05,876
who will dare come to kill me?

777
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:08,182
God!- God?

778
01:19:10,259 --> 01:19:11,351
Where is he?

779
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:13,085
Tell him to come.

780
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:19,633
Don't yearn to see God.
lf you see him, you'll die.

781
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:22,464
Show me!

782
01:19:32,748 --> 01:19:34,545
Death is fast approaching!

783
01:19:36,618 --> 01:19:42,716
Will death come first or your God?
Let's see!

784
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:47,087
Boys! Check if God is coming.

785
01:19:47,262 --> 01:19:52,325
Boss, even God fears you,
so wouldn't dare come here.

786
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:31,004
You wanted to see him, right?
Here he is!

787
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:37,441
Boys, it seems God is here, hack him.

788
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:36,387
Brother! He's running away!

789
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:40,500
He mustn't live, he's burden to earth.

790
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:42,728
Kill that bastard, brother!

791
01:22:59,087 --> 01:23:00,520
Do you know who l am?

792
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:03,920
You're going to die in a minute,
why should l know you?

793
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,269
He's alive!
- Yes.

794
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:29,713
He's alive...
where's the nearest hospital?

795
01:23:33,422 --> 01:23:34,548
Call the doctor immediately.

796
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:35,815
Doctor is in operation theatre.

797
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:37,959
He's dying.

798
01:23:43,965 --> 01:23:46,661
Doctor, he's dying.

799
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:47,927
Taking the last few breathes.

800
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:50,128
A man hacked him.

801
01:24:24,206 --> 01:24:25,503
His life is over.

802
01:24:32,047 --> 01:24:34,641
Doctor, its magic of your hands.

803
01:24:34,816 --> 01:24:35,942
God's mercy!

804
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:48,227
Cleared multiple blocks
in the coronary artery,

805
01:24:48,397 --> 01:24:51,560
give high power analgesics
and antibiotic.

806
01:24:51,733 --> 01:24:53,860
Continue the anti-arithmatics.

807
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:56,460
Start that.

808
01:24:56,938 --> 01:24:58,496
He'll walk happily in 10 days.

809
01:24:58,673 --> 01:25:03,770
One descendent of Bobbili royal family
was London returned FRCS doctor.

810
01:25:03,945 --> 01:25:07,676
Though he had everything,
he wanted to serve the people,

811
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:09,043
that's why,

812
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:14,280
he converted his palace
into a hospital for the poor,

813
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:18,585
he treated them free round the clock.

814
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:23,060
He rebelled against the tormentors.

815
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:25,929
He's ferocious Narasimha
against the criminals,

816
01:25:26,101 --> 01:25:28,399
people were happy under his rule,

817
01:25:35,076 --> 01:25:39,410
He'll come...he'll come...

818
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:03,701
lncarnation of Narasimha...
with the power of lion...

819
01:26:03,872 --> 01:26:07,774
Walks like a warrior...
his words ooze bravery...

820
01:26:07,943 --> 01:26:11,777
When he twirls his moustache,
enemies run helter skelter...

821
01:26:11,947 --> 01:26:15,747
His mere name can send shivers
down the spine of enemies...

822
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:18,886
He's Simha...Narasimha!

823
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:22,182
What brings you here, King?

824
01:26:22,324 --> 01:26:27,785
Are you also scared of us?
- Scared? Me?

825
01:26:29,464 --> 01:26:32,126
Not even dog knows it in my home.

826
01:26:33,835 --> 01:26:34,631
Why are you here then?

827
01:26:34,803 --> 01:26:37,499
lf you don't go good for
the society, its okay,

828
01:26:37,672 --> 01:26:39,469
but never do anything bad.

829
01:26:39,941 --> 01:26:41,169
You've done it.

830
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:43,734
You're still doing it.

831
01:26:44,613 --> 01:26:47,639
No. Stop it.

832
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,483
What if we don't stop it?

833
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:53,645
He said what if we don't stop it?

834
01:26:58,493 --> 01:27:00,654
l'll give just two options to anyone.

835
01:27:00,829 --> 01:27:03,798
l'll treat if anyone is sick.

836
01:27:03,965 --> 01:27:06,957
lf anyone commits mistake,
l'll hack him to death.

837
01:27:07,135 --> 01:27:09,365
Choose between option A or B?

838
01:27:09,538 --> 01:27:13,167
Treatment or get hacked?
Make your choice.

839
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:23,278
Doctor, do you think hacking
means sutures or shot of injection?

840
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:28,017
See...only one side of me.

841
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:31,357
Don't dare to see my other side.

842
01:27:31,626 --> 01:27:33,253
You can't bear it.

843
01:27:33,695 --> 01:27:35,526
You'll be reduced to ashes.

844
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:44,366
Will you kill if we commit a mistake?
- Confirmed.

845
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:51,545
lf you think let bygones be bygones,
and won't happen again,

846
01:27:51,713 --> 01:27:53,203
tension will ease,

847
01:27:53,715 --> 01:27:55,546
heart will work better,

848
01:27:55,884 --> 01:27:57,647
you'll live long,

849
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:06,657
not just sutures, l can stab too.

850
01:28:22,377 --> 01:28:23,366
SP wants you to meet him.

851
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:28,744
Where were you till yesterday?

852
01:29:06,821 --> 01:29:09,221
How can a doctor kill others?

853
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:14,961
How a doctor kills virus
if it enters the body,

854
01:29:15,497 --> 01:29:19,797
l'll kill this human virus
that's affecting our society.

855
01:29:19,968 --> 01:29:22,994
Police is here, we'll take action.

856
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:26,129
Where?

857
01:29:27,175 --> 01:29:29,405
Farmer complained of adulteration,

858
01:29:29,544 --> 01:29:33,173
he was forced to drink that
adulterated insecticide and killed,

859
01:29:33,348 --> 01:29:35,043
after killing the contractors,

860
01:29:35,216 --> 01:29:40,313
and raping the lady officer
who opened the tenders,

861
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:46,755
when people revolted against this,
they were killed mercilessly,

862
01:29:47,462 --> 01:29:50,863
when 60 children died because
of adulterated milk,

863
01:29:51,032 --> 01:29:57,164
you weren't there to pacify
those distressed parents,

864
01:29:57,772 --> 01:30:05,679
they killed barbarically 300
people for going to police,

865
01:30:06,614 --> 01:30:11,847
you didn't come then but came
when l killed a criminal, why?

866
01:30:12,887 --> 01:30:16,084
They too are influential family
like yours in this region.

867
01:30:16,257 --> 01:30:17,690
Don't you know it?

868
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,191
lnfluential family like mine?

869
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:27,530
SP, don't talk about family history.

870
01:30:27,869 --> 01:30:35,037
History is ours!
We create history, or rewrite history.

871
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:38,207
They are nothing.

872
01:30:39,948 --> 01:30:41,210
Dirty scoundrels.

873
01:30:43,585 --> 01:30:47,612
There's nothing to hide with you,
l'm telling you clearly,

874
01:30:47,822 --> 01:30:51,883
l'll kill the criminal, no police.

875
01:31:23,057 --> 01:31:23,853
What did you do with him?

876
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:27,483
You told us to turn blind eye
to your crimes,

877
01:31:27,629 --> 01:31:31,121
he says clearly not to see at all.

878
01:31:31,299 --> 01:31:33,699
As your well wisher, one advice,

879
01:31:33,902 --> 01:31:39,431
l've worked in Khammam,
Kurnool, Guntur,

880
01:31:39,607 --> 01:31:45,273
l've seen many people
but first time l've seen a lion.

881
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:51,109
l've seen Lord Narasimha!

882
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:55,447
Either be careful or leave the place.

883
01:32:06,968 --> 01:32:07,900
Brother!

884
01:32:14,108 --> 01:32:18,306
He's just a doctor, who treats
people we hack,

885
01:32:19,681 --> 01:32:21,979
how could he kill my son?

886
01:32:22,817 --> 01:32:26,514
Why are you silently sitting
like meditating?

887
01:32:26,688 --> 01:32:32,558
l'll kill...l'll kill him, father.

888
01:32:34,462 --> 01:32:37,329
lt's not our tradition
to crib in our homes,

889
01:32:37,899 --> 01:32:42,996
either enemy must fall at our feet
or die in his own home.

890
01:32:43,371 --> 01:32:46,169
Did you hear that, son?

891
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:52,270
He's 4 years younger to you,
yet he's furious to kill him, but you?

892
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:56,839
Sit here!

893
01:32:57,385 --> 01:32:59,182
Look at her!

894
01:32:59,854 --> 01:33:04,314
You must get angry,
his wife must also become a widow.

895
01:33:04,492 --> 01:33:08,121
Till then we mustn't live in peace.

896
01:33:08,296 --> 01:33:10,355
No peace of mind!

897
01:33:42,497 --> 01:33:44,897
What would you like to have?
Coffee or tea?

898
01:33:45,466 --> 01:33:46,398
Where's our son?

899
01:33:54,809 --> 01:33:55,798
Come.

900
01:33:56,477 --> 01:33:59,674
How is your health?
- l'm fine brother.

901
01:33:59,814 --> 01:34:02,009
How is your business going on?
- Fine.

902
01:34:02,183 --> 01:34:04,743
Arrange for their lunch, Gayathri.

903
01:34:06,955 --> 01:34:08,252
Greetings sir.

904
01:34:08,423 --> 01:34:09,754
What brings you here, Priest?

905
01:34:09,924 --> 01:34:13,690
Celebration of Lord Lakshminarasimha
Swamy's marriage is nearing,

906
01:34:13,828 --> 01:34:18,959
though you know it well, it's tradition
to inform you on behalf of temple trustee.

907
01:34:19,133 --> 01:34:23,331
Shall l arrange a holy sacrifice
for the protection of your family?

908
01:34:23,504 --> 01:34:29,465
lt's a tradition we follow every year,
you said family protection,

909
01:34:29,644 --> 01:34:32,135
how can we stop it?

910
01:34:32,313 --> 01:34:34,042
Start immediately after the marriage.

911
01:34:34,215 --> 01:34:37,446
You must do another thing also, sir.

912
01:34:38,386 --> 01:34:43,551
lt's difficult for a priest to eat
three square meals,

913
01:34:43,725 --> 01:34:48,287
you've helped my daughter
to become a doctor,

914
01:34:48,463 --> 01:34:50,556
her marriage is fixed,

915
01:34:51,566 --> 01:34:53,693
she's like your daughter,

916
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:58,966
so after the Lord's marriage,
you must conduct her marriage, sir.

917
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:06,145
May God bless you with long life!

918
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:16,315
What?

919
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:20,427
Savithri, l like you very much.
- ls it?

920
01:35:20,595 --> 01:35:24,463
You're always with sir,
what do you do in hospital?

921
01:35:24,632 --> 01:35:28,659
When sir puts sutures,
l'll do the balance work.

922
01:35:28,836 --> 01:35:30,827
Will you kill if sir orders you?

923
01:35:31,005 --> 01:35:32,666
He'll ask to put sutures,
why would he ask me to kill people?

924
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,899
Will you kill on his order or not?

925
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:38,374
You silly woman!
Do you like killing so much?

926
01:35:38,546 --> 01:35:41,242
What's there in you to like you?

927
01:35:41,416 --> 01:35:43,350
No hair on head,

928
01:35:43,518 --> 01:35:45,145
not even 5 feet tall,

929
01:35:45,319 --> 01:35:48,413
only plus point is you're with sir,

930
01:35:48,589 --> 01:35:54,221
if you give him the weapons
and if he kills bad people,

931
01:35:54,395 --> 01:35:56,556
the blood will spill on you,

932
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:00,197
when you come walking
drenched in blood,

933
01:36:00,368 --> 01:36:03,098
that will be a great sight
to watch your majestic walk.

934
01:36:03,271 --> 01:36:06,206
That should make me fall flat for you.

935
01:36:07,909 --> 01:36:09,638
That's what you call as pride!

936
01:36:10,845 --> 01:36:14,281
This is good to imagine but
giving me jitters to do it.

937
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:15,473
Aren't you a man?

938
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:18,915
When sir is knocking off people's heads,
can't you atleast kill four?

939
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,644
Four?
- How about two?

940
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:23,382
How about two?!
ls it cutting vegetables? Humans!

941
01:36:23,558 --> 01:36:24,889
What ever it is, you must kill.

942
01:36:25,059 --> 01:36:27,755
lf every one kills,
who will supply the weapons?

943
01:36:27,929 --> 01:36:29,556
l don't know.
- Did you read Mahabharata?

944
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:30,924
l've listened.
- Whatever it is.

945
01:36:31,132 --> 01:36:33,965
Did Krishna kill anyone in Mahabharata?
- No!

946
01:36:34,168 --> 01:36:36,432
l'm also like that, like Krishna.

947
01:36:36,604 --> 01:36:38,128
l'll supply and have them killed.

948
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:42,899
Behead four people and come
with their heads, l'll think then.

949
01:36:43,911 --> 01:36:45,503
Four heads?

950
01:36:45,746 --> 01:36:50,740
My fate, l joined doctor to
help in operations,

951
01:36:50,918 --> 01:36:53,284
l had to supply him axes and sickles.

952
01:36:53,454 --> 01:36:58,482
l wanted to marry her and
she insists on bringing four heads.

953
01:37:02,463 --> 01:37:09,266
Anyway, l'll marry you non-violently.
l'll not leave you!

954
01:37:10,705 --> 01:37:12,002
Where's brother-in-law?

955
01:37:12,206 --> 01:37:14,902
He'll not eat anything today.

956
01:37:15,977 --> 01:37:20,880
You please advice your husband,

957
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:26,179
why is he picking up trouble with
others going after their necks?

958
01:37:27,955 --> 01:37:29,616
Do you know with whom
he's fighting now?

959
01:37:30,358 --> 01:37:34,192
They are not so good people,
tell him to be careful.

960
01:37:34,362 --> 01:37:37,627
You tell them to be careful.

961
01:37:39,467 --> 01:37:40,525
Eat!

962
01:37:46,674 --> 01:37:49,973
l want to ask you a thing.
- Go ahead.

963
01:37:50,211 --> 01:37:58,641
How can you be so affectionate
and loving with such a angry man?

964
01:37:59,987 --> 01:38:02,820
You've seen only one side
of the doctor,

965
01:38:02,990 --> 01:38:05,322
do you know how many sides he has?

966
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:31,511
Sister, brother-in-law is here.

967
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:33,346
l know.

968
01:38:33,654 --> 01:38:37,090
Watch, how we'll play with him.
- Please no.

969
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:40,260
Why not? He's a doctor.
Let's see his reaction.

970
01:38:40,428 --> 01:38:42,362
Please no aunt.

971
01:38:42,964 --> 01:38:46,024
What?
- That is....Gayathri...

972
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,725
Tomorrow we've a vow to fulfill,
nothing for next ten days,

973
01:38:48,903 --> 01:38:50,700
close and sleep alone.

974
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:52,866
What?
- Doors!

975
01:38:54,308 --> 01:38:55,798
Oh God!

976
01:38:55,977 --> 01:38:57,205
What's it brother-in-law?

977
01:38:57,378 --> 01:38:59,710
That is...Gayathri...

978
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,314
Tomorrow sister has a vow to fulfill,
nothing for next ten days,

979
01:39:02,483 --> 01:39:04,041
close and sleep alone.

980
01:39:04,218 --> 01:39:06,209
What?
- Windows!

981
01:39:08,656 --> 01:39:09,884
What's it brother-in-law?

982
01:39:10,057 --> 01:39:12,457
That is...Gayathri...

983
01:39:12,627 --> 01:39:15,653
Tomorrow sister has a vow to fulfill,
nothing for next ten days,

984
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:17,593
close and sleep alone.

985
01:39:17,765 --> 01:39:19,733
What should l close now?
- Blanket!

986
01:39:27,341 --> 01:39:31,334
Brother-in-law's face dropped.
- Yes, didn't l tell you?

987
01:39:31,512 --> 01:39:33,742
Doctors are like that, very coward.

988
01:39:39,754 --> 01:39:40,846
Who is it?

989
01:39:41,022 --> 01:39:42,580
lt's me, your younger mother-in-law!

990
01:39:42,757 --> 01:39:45,590
You? l thought it was Gayathri.

991
01:39:59,607 --> 01:40:02,098
Brother-in-law! l'm not Gayathri!

992
01:40:02,276 --> 01:40:04,767
You? l thought it was Gayathri.

993
01:40:07,715 --> 01:40:08,773
He's here!

994
01:40:12,053 --> 01:40:13,111
Sir!

995
01:40:14,055 --> 01:40:15,818
What's that nasty hug?
- You?

996
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:19,118
He's hugging every woman
thinking it's you.

997
01:40:19,293 --> 01:40:22,126
lf you don't go now, l think he'll do
something with some woman.

998
01:40:22,296 --> 01:40:26,460
l'm a strong willed woman,
yet he crushed me in his hug.

999
01:40:26,634 --> 01:40:29,569
What will become of you if he hugs you?

1000
01:40:29,737 --> 01:40:32,103
Sister, your husband is
searching all the rooms.

1001
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:35,470
Go quickly, else he'll come here.

1002
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:47,310
They said you've a vow to fulfill,
nothing for next ten days,

1003
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,921
why are you here then?

1004
01:40:49,123 --> 01:40:50,317
ls it okay to you?

1005
01:41:25,793 --> 01:41:32,631
My strength...my happiness...
it's you, my dear...

1006
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:39,672
You're the apple of my eye,
make my life fruitful...

1007
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,276
Can't breath without you?

1008
01:41:43,477 --> 01:41:46,742
Can't live without uniting with you?

1009
01:41:46,914 --> 01:41:50,145
Fill my lovely evenings
with your romance...

1010
01:41:50,484 --> 01:41:53,851
Fill my life with your love, my dear...

1011
01:41:54,021 --> 01:41:57,388
Little tiffs are cherished memories...

1012
01:41:57,558 --> 01:42:00,857
Drown me with your flow of love...

1013
01:42:01,028 --> 01:42:04,725
Your path is my abode...

1014
01:42:53,981 --> 01:43:00,978
Your royal smile is my jewel of life...

1015
01:43:01,155 --> 01:43:07,856
Your smile is my property and treasure...

1016
01:43:08,028 --> 01:43:14,900
You're my holy hymn,
may l chant it always?

1017
01:43:15,069 --> 01:43:22,066
You're my Gayathri hymn,
may l chant it day and night?

1018
01:43:22,243 --> 01:43:29,012
Your ideals and principles
are mine, l'm with you always...

1019
01:43:29,183 --> 01:43:32,482
Your heart is my pillow...

1020
01:44:36,317 --> 01:44:43,223
Your moustache is charming me
into your heart...

1021
01:44:43,390 --> 01:44:50,296
Your touch is enough
to make love flow...

1022
01:44:50,431 --> 01:44:57,337
My beauty and my heart is yours always...

1023
01:44:57,471 --> 01:45:04,343
You're my everything,
shall l create a new world for you?

1024
01:45:04,478 --> 01:45:11,441
You're a man of character...

1025
01:45:11,619 --> 01:45:14,588
You're God of modern times...

1026
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:44,378
Good after noon, brother-in-law.

1027
01:45:47,154 --> 01:45:49,645
How is you business going on?
- Going on fine.

1028
01:45:49,823 --> 01:45:53,725
Are you doing it alone?
- No, Veera Kesavulu is my partner.

1029
01:45:53,894 --> 01:45:55,521
You know about them, right?

1030
01:45:55,729 --> 01:45:58,254
Business is different from
personal differences.

1031
01:45:58,432 --> 01:46:01,401
Am l not joining with you for lunch
after doing business with them?

1032
01:46:01,535 --> 01:46:03,696
ls it necessary to do business
with such people?

1033
01:46:03,871 --> 01:46:08,672
You've vast property
to last generations,

1034
01:46:08,842 --> 01:46:10,571
you can do anything as you like,

1035
01:46:10,778 --> 01:46:14,305
shouldn't l earn to catch you up?

1036
01:46:14,481 --> 01:46:16,472
l must have relations and
business, right?

1037
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:21,644
To reach my position, if your
business deals kill few people...

1038
01:46:21,822 --> 01:46:26,191
How can l do business
if l keep counting the dead?

1039
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:31,821
lf laying a road knocks of
few homes, we don't stop it, right?

1040
01:46:32,599 --> 01:46:33,827
We'll pull it down.

1041
01:46:38,539 --> 01:46:43,533
Forget about all that.
l'm telling you clearly in one word.

1042
01:46:43,744 --> 01:46:47,737
You said you'll not bother about
other's lives for your business.

1043
01:46:48,182 --> 01:46:52,380
l'll not think a second to kill you too
if you commit crime.

1044
01:46:53,454 --> 01:46:56,184
One patient one treatment,
that's my policy.

1045
01:46:56,457 --> 01:46:59,358
Whether he's outsider or insider.

1046
01:47:00,127 --> 01:47:00,855
Hubby!

1047
01:47:03,063 --> 01:47:05,361
Food is ready.
- l'm coming.

1048
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:10,799
Come, your sister is a
good cook, join me for lunch.

1049
01:47:23,083 --> 01:47:24,311
Are you here?

1050
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:33,220
l'm sad to see you.

1051
01:47:33,660 --> 01:47:37,619
You must be washing my back instead
of vessels with your tender hands.

1052
01:47:37,831 --> 01:47:41,198
l'm sad to see it.
You get up, some one else will do it.

1053
01:47:41,368 --> 01:47:44,132
Why someone else?
Why don't you do it yourself?

1054
01:47:44,304 --> 01:47:45,430
l'll do it.

1055
01:47:45,606 --> 01:47:48,166
Killing people is difficult,
cleaning vessels is easy.

1056
01:47:48,342 --> 01:47:49,570
You come this side.

1057
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:01,747
How am l washing?
- Very nicely.

1058
01:48:01,922 --> 01:48:05,050
lt'll be much better if you
beat up people like this.

1059
01:48:05,225 --> 01:48:08,023
Beat up people?
Be happy with washing clothes.

1060
01:48:08,195 --> 01:48:10,095
l can't beat people.

1061
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:15,595
Do it...cut it...

1062
01:48:15,769 --> 01:48:17,100
Did l cut nicely?

1063
01:48:19,673 --> 01:48:21,072
You came here as compounder,

1064
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:23,607
now you're efficient in
household chores too,

1065
01:48:24,077 --> 01:48:26,477
learn to cook quickly.
- Okay.

1066
01:48:26,647 --> 01:48:29,047
Anyway Savithri is getting
good proposals,

1067
01:48:29,216 --> 01:48:31,377
we'll send her after marriage.
- Madam!

1068
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:39,457
Why did l learn all the
household chores?

1069
01:48:39,626 --> 01:48:41,890
To marry Savithri.

1070
01:48:42,062 --> 01:48:46,965
lf you say that, my life will go waste.

1071
01:48:48,902 --> 01:48:50,699
Aunt knows about this?
- No.

1072
01:48:50,904 --> 01:48:53,134
First take aunt's permission.

1073
01:48:53,574 --> 01:48:57,806
Madam.- What?
- l'm losing hair.

1074
01:48:58,378 --> 01:49:02,075
What do you want me to do?
- l mean...my marriage.

1075
01:49:02,249 --> 01:49:03,841
Which country bride you want?

1076
01:49:04,017 --> 01:49:07,612
Country doesn't matter,
anyway l'll marry a maid only.

1077
01:49:07,754 --> 01:49:10,814
l mean which country's maid?

1078
01:49:10,991 --> 01:49:13,186
No need of country details.

1079
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:16,659
l'll...
- What?

1080
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:20,288
lf l marry the maid here...

1081
01:49:20,467 --> 01:49:24,164
She'll be with you, l'll be with sir.

1082
01:49:24,371 --> 01:49:26,839
Poor girl, she's too good.
- Yes madam.

1083
01:49:27,007 --> 01:49:30,340
How can l ruin her life?
- Ruin?

1084
01:49:31,245 --> 01:49:35,011
ls she interested?
- l don't know madam. l've made a try.

1085
01:49:35,182 --> 01:49:37,514
Where is she?
- Here!

1086
01:49:38,752 --> 01:49:42,210
You like him?
- l like him, madam.

1087
01:49:43,757 --> 01:49:45,122
What did you like in him?

1088
01:49:45,292 --> 01:49:47,886
How can she answer it, madam?
She'll feel shy, right?

1089
01:49:48,061 --> 01:49:50,461
Why should l feel shy?
- Don't you've shame?

1090
01:49:50,631 --> 01:49:55,295
He may cut throats but
cuts vegetables very well,

1091
01:49:55,469 --> 01:49:56,936
cleans vessels cleanly,

1092
01:49:57,104 --> 01:49:59,868
draws water from well,
washes clothes cleanly,

1093
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:03,134
l've a hut, l need security for it.

1094
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:08,646
lf l marry him, he'll secure my hut
and be my husband, madam.

1095
01:50:09,383 --> 01:50:14,150
Doctor, save my child, l think
my child will die, please save it.

1096
01:50:14,321 --> 01:50:15,515
save my child please.

1097
01:50:16,056 --> 01:50:17,751
Bleached the entire area?
- Yes sir.

1098
01:50:17,958 --> 01:50:18,925
All villages around here also.

1099
01:50:19,092 --> 01:50:21,060
l've given fluids to all patients.

1100
01:50:23,263 --> 01:50:26,323
Please save my husband sir.

1101
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:31,733
l'm like your son,
when l'm here no one will die.

1102
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:37,408
Elderly man, nothing to worry.

1103
01:50:52,392 --> 01:50:55,020
l was waiting for you only.

1104
01:50:55,195 --> 01:50:58,130
You killed my brother for
tormenting the people,

1105
01:50:58,298 --> 01:51:01,131
how dare you enter my area and
get respected by my people.

1106
01:51:01,969 --> 01:51:05,132
This is not the time,
people are in distress.

1107
01:51:05,305 --> 01:51:08,433
They must bear our scolding,
beatings and killings, it's their fate.

1108
01:51:08,608 --> 01:51:11,133
That's my people!
Why are you saving them?

1109
01:51:11,311 --> 01:51:13,108
Chase them away!

1110
01:51:15,115 --> 01:51:19,108
You want me!
Fight me!

1111
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:21,451
Come with 10 henchmen!

1112
01:51:21,822 --> 01:51:23,790
lncrease it by 10 again.

1113
01:51:24,057 --> 01:51:25,456
Come ten times.

1114
01:51:26,093 --> 01:51:27,287
l'm ready.

1115
01:51:28,028 --> 01:51:29,461
Don't torment people.

1116
01:51:30,397 --> 01:51:31,125
Go away!

1117
01:51:31,798 --> 01:51:34,961
Bloody people!
How dare you save them!

1118
01:51:36,203 --> 01:51:41,641
lf l beat you've to spend
your property for tests only. Go!

1119
01:51:42,075 --> 01:51:43,633
Bloody kid!

1120
01:51:44,244 --> 01:51:47,236
Sir, my husband has survived.

1121
01:51:50,617 --> 01:51:51,641
Continue the fluids.

1122
01:51:51,818 --> 01:51:53,979
Give terramycin every six hours...

1123
01:51:55,889 --> 01:51:58,483
How dare you save him
though l'd warned you not.

1124
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:45,590
Sir!

1125
01:54:02,415 --> 01:54:04,781
Are people's lives so cheap to you?

1126
01:54:36,883 --> 01:54:38,145
What happened, son?

1127
01:54:41,621 --> 01:54:47,184
l must be saving lives but hunting
down people like beasts, mother.

1128
01:54:48,929 --> 01:54:51,591
When l killed a rogue in public,
they were happy,

1129
01:54:52,332 --> 01:54:54,664
when l started eliminating such goons,

1130
01:54:55,168 --> 01:54:57,500
people are afraid of me also, mother.

1131
01:55:00,674 --> 01:55:05,509
But l can't hold myself
on seeing the tormentors.

1132
01:55:09,749 --> 01:55:11,011
Wrong son,

1133
01:55:11,651 --> 01:55:16,918
people committing mistakes too get
scared of furious form of Narasimha,

1134
01:55:17,591 --> 01:55:22,085
those who don't commit mistakes
will pray with devotion.

1135
01:55:23,697 --> 01:55:27,292
To make justice prevail,
to eliminate evil,

1136
01:55:27,467 --> 01:55:31,369
show me one God who didn't pick
up a weapon to fight it out.

1137
01:55:32,939 --> 01:55:36,705
God himself couldn't do without
weapon, you're nothing.

1138
01:55:37,978 --> 01:55:42,210
People who saw Rama as just a King,

1139
01:55:42,382 --> 01:55:46,216
after he killed demon Ravana,
he was prayed as God!

1140
01:55:48,054 --> 01:55:51,217
You're the epitome ofjustice
for good people,

1141
01:55:51,858 --> 01:55:57,819
people will know that you're
God of death to the evil also.

1142
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:04,662
You needn't take a step back
because they fear you,

1143
01:56:05,138 --> 01:56:06,605
kill the evil,

1144
01:56:07,107 --> 01:56:08,404
it's not a mistake,

1145
01:56:10,677 --> 01:56:16,411
any mother will be happy if she has
son who will look after her well,

1146
01:56:17,284 --> 01:56:21,744
but if she has a son
whom the world reveres,

1147
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:25,090
she'll be ten times more happy,

1148
01:56:25,525 --> 01:56:33,364
Lord Narasimha Swamy himself
has come as my son.

1149
01:56:54,821 --> 01:56:58,450
People used to think
we were born to kill,

1150
01:57:00,026 --> 01:57:06,090
but after Simha's arrival,
they think we are here to get killed.

1151
01:57:06,232 --> 01:57:09,133
ls this life necessary to us?

1152
01:57:09,302 --> 01:57:11,702
Will he kill if we commit crime?

1153
01:57:12,472 --> 01:57:15,100
Does he think we belong
to Gandhi family?

1154
01:57:15,241 --> 01:57:18,142
Actually we had risen to this position
by committing crimes only.

1155
01:57:18,311 --> 01:57:22,748
We did crimes, we'll do it,
we'll keep on doing.

1156
01:57:22,916 --> 01:57:25,817
Will he kill for that?
Will he kill all of us?

1157
01:57:29,556 --> 01:57:35,085
One needs weapon only
till he reaches a position,

1158
01:57:36,129 --> 01:57:41,726
once he crosses that position,
he himself becomes a weapon,

1159
01:57:42,469 --> 01:57:45,961
we must stop him here,

1160
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:51,868
if not people will use his name,

1161
01:57:52,379 --> 01:57:56,076
and make our future generations
also wet in their dresses,

1162
01:57:56,216 --> 01:57:57,342
these people!

1163
01:57:59,819 --> 01:58:03,186
Can't you stop him?

1164
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:09,856
Only his death can stop
Narasimha in this world.

1165
01:58:12,465 --> 01:58:14,399
l'm killing him, father.

1166
01:58:18,972 --> 01:58:21,202
What are you saying?

1167
01:58:21,474 --> 01:58:27,208
Once you get killed by Simha, he'll be
scared to come back as human,

1168
01:58:27,714 --> 01:58:29,875
he kills so barbarously,

1169
01:58:30,083 --> 01:58:33,382
you've seen it twice,

1170
01:58:34,487 --> 01:58:35,545
no!

1171
01:58:38,224 --> 01:58:41,557
l'm killing him...killing him.

1172
01:58:53,273 --> 01:58:55,036
l want to meet Dr. Narasimha.

1173
01:58:55,208 --> 01:58:56,903
He has gone for an urgent operation.

1174
01:58:57,076 --> 01:59:02,412
What operation?
Saving lives or taking lives?

1175
01:59:03,016 --> 01:59:04,005
Please take your seat.

1176
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,512
l don't sit in criminal's house.

1177
01:59:06,286 --> 01:59:09,414
Tell your husband,

1178
01:59:09,889 --> 01:59:13,325
if you kill someone,
people will start supporting you,

1179
01:59:13,793 --> 01:59:17,854
thinking it as heroism,
taking law into his own hands,

1180
01:59:18,031 --> 01:59:20,522
hunting anyone he thinks is evil,

1181
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:23,931
he's going on a killing spree,

1182
01:59:25,305 --> 01:59:26,294
this is not right.

1183
01:59:26,473 --> 01:59:29,101
What would you like to have?
Coffee or tea?

1184
01:59:33,713 --> 01:59:35,772
Do you know what is an encounter?

1185
01:59:36,749 --> 01:59:38,944
We've started it recently
in North lndia.

1186
01:59:44,791 --> 01:59:46,452
You've started it just now,

1187
01:59:46,659 --> 01:59:48,286
he had started it long back,

1188
01:59:49,162 --> 01:59:50,629
his system is also same,

1189
01:59:56,803 --> 01:59:58,532
do you really know about him?

1190
01:59:59,806 --> 02:00:01,205
lt's a divine thing,

1191
02:00:02,008 --> 02:00:05,967
do you how dedicated one
must be to save a life?

1192
02:00:06,312 --> 02:00:08,974
Do you know how sensitive his
mind and heart should be?

1193
02:00:10,049 --> 02:00:15,316
Do you how much struggle such a
doctor will go through to kill a man?

1194
02:00:16,055 --> 02:00:18,649
He should be coming home
after saving lives,

1195
02:00:18,825 --> 02:00:22,818
but he's coming home after killing
people with bloodied hands,

1196
02:00:23,096 --> 02:00:25,826
he never sleeps that day,

1197
02:00:26,366 --> 02:00:30,826
but the entire region which
trusts him sleeps peacefully, you know that?

1198
02:00:34,374 --> 02:00:38,504
The house which rejoices
the day he saves a life,

1199
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:43,849
nobody in home eats the day he comes
after killing someone, you know that?

1200
02:00:44,417 --> 02:00:47,545
But people who trust him
celebrate it like festival.

1201
02:00:48,087 --> 02:00:49,952
That's what he wants.

1202
02:00:50,690 --> 02:00:54,353
According to you what he's
doing may be murders,

1203
02:00:54,961 --> 02:00:58,692
according to us
what he's doing is treatment.

1204
02:00:59,832 --> 02:01:03,359
lf injustice happens
where justice should happen,

1205
02:01:03,536 --> 02:01:06,130
it gives birth to jungle justice,

1206
02:01:06,606 --> 02:01:08,972
in your language it's out of law,

1207
02:01:09,275 --> 02:01:10,367
in our language,

1208
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:15,538
this is history,

1209
02:01:15,782 --> 02:01:18,876
Narasimha is born for it.

1210
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:24,049
His ideal is greater than your gun.

1211
02:01:24,824 --> 02:01:26,052
You can't stand him.

1212
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:28,390
Go!

1213
02:01:32,498 --> 02:01:34,159
What brings you here, officer?

1214
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,432
Are you not feeling well?

1215
02:01:35,602 --> 02:01:38,662
Nothing doctor, taken new charge,

1216
02:01:38,838 --> 02:01:40,738
just to meet you casually.

1217
02:01:41,941 --> 02:01:43,738
Did you have coffee?

1218
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:51,417
Son, get ready to conduct marriage.
- Okay mother.

1219
02:02:06,332 --> 02:02:10,166
To killing evil demons...

1220
02:02:10,336 --> 02:02:14,136
You came down to earth Lord Narasimha...

1221
02:02:14,307 --> 02:02:22,146
A demon's son who insisted your
existence, you gave him refuge lord...

02:02:22,315 --> 02:02:30,120
Love Narasimha...

1223
02:02:30,289 --> 02:02:34,055
Furious Simha who demolished evil...

1224
02:02:34,227 --> 02:02:38,095
Apostle of peace...
cleanser of sins...

1225
02:02:38,264 --> 02:02:47,536
Blessing the devotees
with immense wealth...

1226
02:03:08,361 --> 02:03:16,097
Come, let's see this visual delight...

1227
02:03:16,269 --> 02:03:24,005
Your auspicious marriage

1228
02:03:24,177 --> 02:03:32,107
Marriage of Lord Lakshminarasimha...

1229
02:03:32,285 --> 02:03:40,124
A celestial grandeur on earth...

1230
02:03:40,293 --> 02:03:48,132
Entire sky is the canopy...
entire earth is the stage...

1231
02:03:48,301 --> 02:03:56,140
Your marriage is being celebrated
as a great event...

1232
02:03:56,309 --> 02:04:03,977
A prayer that's not offered
in any world...

1233
02:04:04,183 --> 02:04:12,557
A grand prayer which wasn't
offered in any past era...

1234
02:04:36,315 --> 02:04:40,183
Reverberating with holy hymns...

1235
02:04:40,353 --> 02:04:44,119
lt's divine to hear it...

1236
02:04:44,290 --> 02:04:52,197
When you see your husband
with love, it great to watch...

1237
02:04:52,365 --> 02:05:00,101
You both are made for
each other couple...

1238
02:05:00,273 --> 02:05:08,044
All three worlds worship
the Goddess...

1239
02:05:08,214 --> 02:05:12,082
Auspicious events as relations...

1240
02:05:12,251 --> 02:05:16,153
Dreams as the dowry...

1241
02:05:16,322 --> 02:05:23,990
As presiding deity of Kalvapuri,
Yadagiri and Mangalagiri...

1242
02:05:24,163 --> 02:05:32,571
Your marriage here is a
visual delight to the world...

1243
02:06:00,433 --> 02:06:08,101
Stars are falling as holy rice
on your head...

1244
02:06:08,274 --> 02:06:16,147
Earth and sky become
your marriage band here...

1245
02:06:16,315 --> 02:06:23,983
Balakrishna's mischievous ploy
behind the screen...

1246
02:06:24,156 --> 02:06:32,120
While tying the knot
pinches mischievously...

1247
02:06:32,298 --> 02:06:40,000
Playing mischief or pinching,
the groom is Lord Srihari...

1248
02:06:40,172 --> 02:06:48,045
As presiding deity of Vedagiri,
Antharvedi, Ahobilam...

1249
02:08:03,589 --> 02:08:09,824
Priest, entire family must die taking
this poison filled holy water.

1250
02:08:09,996 --> 02:08:13,295
You must give it to them.

1251
02:08:24,276 --> 02:08:25,800
Priest, give them holy water.

1252
02:08:44,730 --> 02:08:46,391
Priest, give them holy water.

1253
02:08:58,277 --> 02:09:00,074
What happened, priest?

1254
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:02,640
l'm asking you what happened?

1255
02:09:02,815 --> 02:09:04,840
Please don't ask me anything.

1256
02:09:05,017 --> 02:09:06,382
This sacrifice must carry on.

1257
02:09:06,552 --> 02:09:10,511
Sacrifice will not stop,
l've heir. Tell me.

1258
02:09:12,825 --> 02:09:16,124
l don't mind if my lone
daughter is killed,

1259
02:09:16,295 --> 02:09:20,026
if you're safe, you can
save millions of lives.

1260
02:09:57,736 --> 02:10:00,500
Boss, he has entered
our area of attack.

1261
02:10:00,773 --> 02:10:04,402
Narasimha, you can't go
back alive from here.

1262
02:10:04,877 --> 02:10:09,246
Who are you to decide
births and deaths?

1263
02:10:09,415 --> 02:10:10,905
God decides it.

1264
02:10:12,151 --> 02:10:13,584
Your fate must have it.

1265
02:10:20,092 --> 02:10:21,252
Why did you stop?

1266
02:10:22,361 --> 02:10:25,091
You will stop...its sentiment.

1267
02:10:27,333 --> 02:10:35,433
Any man would wet his pant
to look at my home.

1268
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:44,115
You came and they are
pissing on my house.

1269
02:10:45,017 --> 02:10:49,283
lt's not your fault,
it's fault of your blood.

1270
02:10:49,922 --> 02:10:56,760
Man is mad about money, power,
but why are you mad for masses?

1271
02:10:57,696 --> 02:11:01,996
lf anyone says
l'm in trouble brother,

1272
02:11:02,201 --> 02:11:04,965
your blood boils up!

1273
02:11:05,738 --> 02:11:08,206
l'll reduce it.

1274
02:11:10,075 --> 02:11:12,475
Throw it...throw it away.

1275
02:11:17,449 --> 02:11:19,974
Come...come...

1276
02:11:20,619 --> 02:11:21,813
Fall on my feet.

1277
02:11:57,423 --> 02:11:58,515
Father!

1278
02:13:28,147 --> 02:13:31,014
Hubby!

1279
02:13:47,866 --> 02:13:49,299
We got you!

1280
02:13:49,468 --> 02:13:55,634
Unless we cheat your eyes,
we can't stab you, Narasimha!

1281
02:13:56,875 --> 02:13:58,137
That's why this!

1282
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:04,476
Your son and the old woman
are also caught,

1283
02:14:04,650 --> 02:14:06,140
we'll not spare them too.

1284
02:14:08,020 --> 02:14:11,478
Are you really a man
who hides behind woman?

1285
02:14:12,324 --> 02:14:16,488
Though sword has pierced through him,
the anger hasn't diminished in his eyes,

1286
02:14:17,262 --> 02:14:18,820
he's the real man,

1287
02:14:20,132 --> 02:14:22,999
if you've guts, face him!

1288
02:14:23,235 --> 02:14:26,432
Hubby! Before l breathe my last,

1289
02:14:28,707 --> 02:14:33,610
not one of them here must live.

1290
02:18:25,711 --> 02:18:26,973
Mummy, get up.

1291
02:18:27,579 --> 02:18:29,069
Get up, mummy.

1292
02:18:29,581 --> 02:18:31,071
Mummy, get up.

1293
02:18:32,217 --> 02:18:34,583
Daddy, mummy isn't getting up.

1294
02:18:35,754 --> 02:18:38,689
Tell mummy to get up, daddy.

1295
02:18:39,725 --> 02:18:41,090
Tell her to get up.

1296
02:18:42,461 --> 02:18:45,191
Mummy, get up.

1297
02:18:47,466 --> 02:18:49,093
Mummy, get up.

1298
02:19:15,661 --> 02:19:17,629
What's this?

1299
02:19:23,468 --> 02:19:26,232
l should've been consigned
to flames by my son,

1300
02:19:26,405 --> 02:19:30,466
but my misfortune l had
to see my son's death.

1301
02:19:32,778 --> 02:19:36,270
l should be playing with
my grandchildren,

1302
02:19:36,448 --> 02:19:40,145
but had to take the
responsibility of raising you,

1303
02:19:41,086 --> 02:19:46,149
why did l leave that place
to raise you here?

1304
02:19:46,391 --> 02:19:51,988
l was scared you would also take
to weapons for people like my son.

1305
02:19:55,934 --> 02:19:58,095
We don't want anything of this.

1306
02:19:58,804 --> 02:20:03,798
lf anything happens to you,
l don't have strength to bear it.

1307
02:20:03,975 --> 02:20:07,968
Grandma, if taking on a problem
is mistake,

1308
02:20:08,146 --> 02:20:11,343
its grave mistake to leave a problem
that comes searching to you.

1309
02:20:11,983 --> 02:20:14,213
Let's go.
- Where to?

1310
02:20:14,386 --> 02:20:18,686
Do you know why my father
made me sit in his place?

1311
02:20:18,857 --> 02:20:21,792
He wanted me to replace him.

1312
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:26,192
You tried to wish it away,
that's why the problem came to us.

1313
02:20:26,832 --> 02:20:28,459
They killed the hunter.

1314
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:31,068
lf those man eaters have to die,

1315
02:20:31,236 --> 02:20:33,431
the hunt must begin again!

1316
02:20:40,912 --> 02:20:42,436
More the man who commit the crime,

1317
02:20:42,581 --> 02:20:47,712
the man who knows it and yet
doesn't try to stop is heinous crime.

1318
02:20:49,221 --> 02:20:55,990
l was mute witness to the
killing of my brother-in-law,

1319
02:20:56,161 --> 02:21:00,063
that's the gravest sin
l had committed in my life.

1320
02:21:01,333 --> 02:21:09,900
l had to pay heavily for it seeing
my son die right before my eyes.

1321
02:21:12,677 --> 02:21:17,080
But God has given me an
opportunity to correct my mistake.

1322
02:21:18,383 --> 02:21:24,413
Heir to the clan l thought
had perished is alive,

1323
02:21:26,391 --> 02:21:33,763
l'll give your hand in marriage
to him and repent for my sins.

1324
02:22:21,813 --> 02:22:27,649
Janaki! Where are you going?

1325
02:22:34,392 --> 02:22:40,422
Why are you after me?

1326
02:22:40,599 --> 02:22:46,697
Come behind the tree...
l'll make your sari to sweat...

1327
02:22:47,038 --> 02:22:53,068
lf l say yes once...
you'll ask it every day...

1328
02:22:53,245 --> 02:22:56,681
Don't hide your beauty
from me, you devil....

1329
02:23:47,465 --> 02:23:53,301
l like your beauty and curves...
Tell me the secret of raising it...

1330
02:23:53,772 --> 02:23:56,900
Tell him...

1331
02:23:57,075 --> 02:24:03,105
Your hug is the tablet...
the fever has vanished...

1332
02:24:03,415 --> 02:24:09,285
lf you make an open invitation...
can l fulfill my desires...

1333
02:24:09,454 --> 02:24:15,757
lf you provoke me so much...
may l give myself to you...

1334
02:24:16,027 --> 02:24:21,966
l'm the winner in any arena...
- Close the door quickly...

1335
02:24:22,133 --> 02:24:25,591
You're the queen of
my jasmine nights...

1336
02:25:22,794 --> 02:25:28,858
Lock my lip with your lip...
trumpets of youth will rock the world...

1337
02:25:29,267 --> 02:25:32,293
Lock it...

1338
02:25:32,470 --> 02:25:38,466
Keep the shyness away...
lit fire to my sensuous place...

1339
02:25:38,676 --> 02:25:44,672
As your sari end slips,
it's rocking my heart...

1340
02:25:44,883 --> 02:25:51,186
lf you're so hungry, shall l become
your feast to satiate it?

1341
02:25:51,423 --> 02:25:57,362
Your beauty is ravishing...
- Have a blast with it...

1342
02:25:57,529 --> 02:26:01,021
Any delay further will mar
the fun of nights...

1343
02:26:24,122 --> 02:26:25,214
Stop!

1344
02:26:35,834 --> 02:26:36,732
Stop!

1345
02:26:41,072 --> 02:26:43,563
l'm taking my wife.

1346
02:26:47,312 --> 02:26:48,336
Take her.

1347
02:26:51,549 --> 02:26:54,746
Dear...dear...what are you doing?

1348
02:26:54,919 --> 02:26:58,218
You got our son killed,
now want our daughter to die?

1349
02:26:58,389 --> 02:27:01,586
He's not taking your daughter,

1350
02:27:01,993 --> 02:27:03,585
...his death!

1351
02:27:18,543 --> 02:27:20,272
Why are you arrogant?

1352
02:27:21,312 --> 02:27:25,612
Carried away by the protection
of a college teacher?

1353
02:27:26,918 --> 02:27:28,112
Tell him to come.

1354
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:31,387
Let him step here!

1355
02:27:57,549 --> 02:27:58,641
Brother!

1356
02:28:01,586 --> 02:28:03,986
What happened?

1357
02:28:04,155 --> 02:28:05,053
Father...

1358
02:28:05,256 --> 02:28:06,314
What happened to father?

1359
02:28:07,425 --> 02:28:09,893
Took away our father.
- Who?

1360
02:28:26,911 --> 02:28:29,277
Are you astonished, Veer Kesava?

1361
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:32,941
After seeing son die before my eyes,

1362
02:28:33,084 --> 02:28:38,852
are you astonished to see this
old woman still alive after 30 years?

1363
02:28:39,958 --> 02:28:44,452
lf anyone dies before our eyes,
it'll hurt here.

1364
02:28:44,629 --> 02:28:49,589
But if it's one's own progeny,
it'll hurt here!

1365
02:28:50,468 --> 02:28:55,531
You've been fated to feel that pain.

1366
02:29:01,546 --> 02:29:03,537
Who brought you here, father?

1367
02:29:03,715 --> 02:29:06,206
He...this old woman!

1368
02:29:07,385 --> 02:29:11,549
She's not old woman but our trouble.

1369
02:29:12,257 --> 02:29:16,853
Once her son destroyed our power,

1370
02:29:17,028 --> 02:29:20,395
l finished him here only,

1371
02:29:21,065 --> 02:29:23,226
now his son is here,

1372
02:29:23,401 --> 02:29:27,064
same people, same place,

1373
02:29:27,739 --> 02:29:29,570
same clan,

1374
02:29:30,241 --> 02:29:31,902
same enmity,

1375
02:29:32,610 --> 02:29:35,977
he must meet the same end
his father met.

1376
02:29:36,114 --> 02:29:37,240
Kill him!

1377
02:30:01,873 --> 02:30:06,173
You escaped from me in city.

1378
02:30:06,411 --> 02:30:10,609
l'll surely kill you here.

1379
02:30:16,054 --> 02:30:18,921
lf you want to fight a lion,
your paw must be sharp,

1380
02:30:19,123 --> 02:30:21,990
if you want to fight with clan,
your blood must be hot,

1381
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:25,288
you must check ten times
before taking on,

1382
02:30:25,797 --> 02:30:27,697
basically l'm a lecturer,

1383
02:30:27,865 --> 02:30:29,457
if l start with the ring of bell,

1384
02:30:29,634 --> 02:30:33,365
it's my habit to finish lesson or
killing before the next ring of bell,

1385
02:30:33,538 --> 02:30:35,472
no more words, come on!

1386
02:31:32,630 --> 02:31:34,860
Hey get up!

1387
02:31:37,568 --> 02:31:40,366
Never give an opportunity
to that family.

1388
02:31:41,372 --> 02:31:43,863
lf they get up, we can't stop them.

1389
02:31:44,041 --> 02:31:45,531
Kill him!

1390
02:33:42,660 --> 02:33:50,499
Society doesn't need such a man.
Kill him.

1391
02:34:23,234 --> 02:34:30,367
Hail Lord Narasimha!
