1
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,456
Just work should not stop.

2
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:56,457
For us, Srinivas's team will /be better in long run.

3
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,299
Long run.

4
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,236
E work should be done/at the time when it's requir

5
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,273
I knew Rajiv will say /something like that.

6
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,377
Let me and Madhu talk for once.

7
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,291
Just the work shouldn't stop.

8
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,504
There during the digging /for the foundation,

9
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,279
workers found a stone

10
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,282
the shape of that stone is

11
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,251
like the idol of Lord Ganpati

12
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:53,483
Vorkers wish the place where/they found that ston

13
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,427
there should be a small /temple be built.

14
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,461
How could you bring such /useless things to me?

15
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,299
Tell worker, they can take/the stone with them

16
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,441
change my foundation /plan for such superstitious

17
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,446
Got it?

18
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,484
I forgot,

00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,324
it was your wedding /anniversary yesterday.

20
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,263
What did you two do yesterday?

Hy did we get married? /We were regretting on tha

22
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,278
You'll blow her ear.

23
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,482
Come on.

24
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:10,327
An that I took from you, /I'll take 6 more month to

25
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,398
I've told you that wasn't a loan.

26
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,367
Leave it, don't embarrass me.

27
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,250
What happened?

Everything is going very well. /Isn't it?

31
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,311
Shouldn't we hold prayers/at home next week?

32
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,246
Do it. But don't drag me/into the prayers.

33
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,450
If with the grace of God /we're having all this happ

34
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,218
Then what's wrong with that?

35
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:54,297
E work, hard work and /every time your God takes

36
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,472
The stone they found at the site... /- Great.

37
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,513
So you have also heard about it.

38
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,251
V, if the workers want that, /build a small temple th

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,356
w I have also seen /something like that in religious

40
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,258
People believe in such things.

41
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,352
They worship it.

42
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,263
Hen you do prayers and all /at home, do I interfere

43
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:31,496
Then don't bring your god into/my work.

44
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,440
Rajiv, I was just...

45
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,215
Listen, can I have a cup of tea?

46
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,390
Laxmi! Bring kids.

47
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,359
Yes madam.

48
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,301
What did you do in school today?

49
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,466
I drew Spiderman in drawing test.

50
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,270
You drew Spiderman?

51
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,402
A Sardar Spiderman Papa.

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,213

M doing the role of Helen of/Troy in the school ski

55
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,387
My teacher has selected me.

56
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,288
Who's that Helen?

57
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,262
Grandma! Don't you know/about Helen of Troy?

58
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:42,256
Here are a lot of things your/grandma know and

59
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,268
So don't make fun of her.

60
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,370
Papa we shall go out today.

Rajiv, turn on the TV.

64
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,507
Hanuman is the lord of Strength.

65
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,485
Es, there used to be/Hanuman temples outside of

66
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,418
When Hanuman went out in search /of Seeta Mai...

67
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:48,222
No devil could stand against him.

68
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,301
Laxmi also prays Hanuman everyday.

69
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,329
What she'll do with his strength?

70
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,233
You're very naughty. /A little devil.

71
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,246
When Hanuman was as little/as you,

72
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:04,506
he used to be very naughty.

73
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,410
Yes, devil.

74
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,250
Devil?

75
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,214
Grandma is telling us about devils.

76
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,523
Grandma! Is devil afraid of God?

77
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,355
What are you telling them mom?

78
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:23,301
There was no devil how/could we see the power

79
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,469
Come on, go to sleep now.

80
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,467
Come on kids.

81
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,216
You too go to sleep mom.

82
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,482
I gave that job to/Anshuman and Madhu.

83
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,453
Whatever you say.

84
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,331
But Anshuman and Madhu /seem strange to me.

85
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,267
Specially Madhu

86
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,329
With her style, /he looks crazy to me.

87
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,301
No man. I also used to/feel that.

88
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,370
But she's too smart.

89
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,507
Ve can't judge people/with their behavior and style

90
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:31,253
he looks like crazy and /childish but as far as work

91
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,263
What happened?

92
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,506
N your mom were saying, /why didn't you listen to

93
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,238
Sister hit me first.

94
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,273
Go inside or I'll hit you.

95
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,480
Rajiv, think before yelling at kids.

96
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,250
It was my mistake. /I made Rohan do that.

97
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,232
How much Rajiv loves his daughter.

98
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,394
Are you all right?

99
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,468
When did you guys come?

100
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,335
Just now.

101
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,507
Sit down.

102
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,322
We talked with Srinivas, /he's agreed.

103
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,330
All right but keep him /under control.

104
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,324
There's nothing to worry about.

105
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,428
We've squeezed him very /well this time.

106
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,287
Did you read the books/I sent for you?

107
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,415
No, those are for little kids.

108
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,222
So you're grown up.

109
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,353
Yet you sit on Papa's lap.

110
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,363
Whatever I like. /What's your problem?

111
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,389
Raksha, is this a way /to talk to elders?

112
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,455
She's a kid.

113
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,399
I'm arranging a party /tomorrow night.

114
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,394
For getting the contract.

115
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,428
Why are you standing there? /Come here.

116
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,341
I need to talk to you.

117
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,422
Come inside.

118
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,505
Will you cheat on me?

119
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,406
How dare you? /How did you do fraud with me?

120
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,280
I didn't...

121
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,218
What is this Anshuman?

122
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:44,458
You two have... /I thought you were poor but you...

123
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,232
What happened Rajiv?

124
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,331
Ask him.

125
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,477
Had you asked, I would have/given you as charity.

126
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,407
I trusted you and you /did fraud with me.

127
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,281
I will not spare you.

128
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,377
You cheat.

129
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:09,486
Omorrow's newspaper, /they have nothing to do wit

130
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,260
on't be responsible for any /deal they make with an

131
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,233
This is company's car/not yours.

132
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,402
Get out and walk.

133
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,304
Go away.

134
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,422
I've never seen you this angry.

135
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,456
Mom, I don't want to/talk about this anymore.

136
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,269
Aarti, go and sleep.

137
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,246
Forget it.

138
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,257
Rajiv, it's good that they're/caught now.

139
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,389
It could have been a bigger loss.

140
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,237
Loss is not about money.

141
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,271
It's the trust.

142
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,261
We won't kill him.

143
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,430
We'll make him miserable.

144
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,335
He loves his daughter too much.

145
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,272
At happened to Anshuman /and Madhu's replaceme

146

I want to meet the new contractors/we appointed.

Told you before about/the temple that workers wa

149
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,393
You're still talking about that?

150
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,394
Er workers will say /and you'll keep on listening. W

151
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:30,238
No sir, their religious sentiments.

152
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,264
What religious sentiments? /Stop it.

153
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,312
We are here construct a building /not a temple.

154

Just a little thing. Build a temple. /What will you lo

00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,257
It's just a half day job.

156
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,352
Don't tell me that you believe/in all this.

157
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,227
Are not loosing anything /then what's wrong in agr

158
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,359
Rajiv, Raksha is lost.

Ve searched the whole/house but she's not anywh

160
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,471
Come quickly.

161
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,309
I'm coming.

162
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,293
Did you find her? /- She's nowhere.

163
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,251
Raksha! How did you come here?

164
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:31,388
Are you all right?

165
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,253
Lets go home

166
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,257
What are you looking at?

167
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,250
Why did you go there?

168
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,477
Tell me. /Why are you quite?

169
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,479
I'm asking something.

170
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,420
What does she think?

171
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,486
Don't yell at her, /talk politely.

172
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,264
It's my mistake, /I've spoiled her.

173
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,300
You ask her.

174
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,353
I honestly don't know

175
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,457
that how did I go there.

176
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:38,299
Guy before you, we had /a bad experience with h

177
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,241
With due course, you'll find out.

You're joining from the/day after tomorrow. Right?

179

Mr. Lawyer! /Everything is all right?

Shinde is government employee.

181
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,491
He wanted 5. /I settled on 3.

182
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,298
You could have given /him 5.

183
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,328
I'm concerned with my work.

184
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,498
Should I get you something? /Tea or cold drink?

185
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,433
Bring tea.

186
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,379
Sir those contractors...

187
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,438
Yes all of them are ok. /Give them extension.

188
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,471
Ok sir.

189
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,310
Don't you and workers understand?

190
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,355
I won't do that because/you're asking.

191
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,485
Expel all these workers.

192
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,252
And call that Kalyan /and his labor team.

193
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,226
No go.

194
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,255
Go

195
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,269
What happened to the tea?

196
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,341
It's not that serious matter.

197
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,302
N ancient conflict/between believers and non-belie

198
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,409
Between them, guys like you,

199
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,378
who believe and don't believe.

200
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,456
It's safe. /- What safe?

201
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,358
A person who takes advantage/of beliefs in religio

202
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,287
Our Hindu religion tells us,

203
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:10,391
tter how many sins you do, /just pray once and you

204
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,402
Everything forgiven.

205
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,268
Whenever such matters are raised.

206
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,434
As long as my time and energy /doesn't waste,

207
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,341
I'm with them.

208
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,329
What happened?

209
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,398
Are you all right?

210
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,466
What happened?

211
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,311
Did you have a nightmare?

212
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,448
Go to sleep.

213
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,267
What is this?

214
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,500
I don't know.

215
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,435
What is this? /- I don't know sir.

216
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,274
How did it come in the compound?

217
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:32,271
Some dog might have brought it in. /- Or a crow.

218
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,285
Dumbo! Crow can't carry this weight.

219
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,456
Throw it out.

220
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,390
I can't touch it.

221
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,257
What?

222
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,428
You throw it.

223
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,488
Me? /- What me?

224
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,256
V did that bone and lemon /came into your compou

225
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,455
Who knows?

226
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,226
What do you mean?

227
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,293
Then? /- Then what?

228
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,397
We threw all that out of compound.

229
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:56,450
S Laxmi so afraid when /she saw that lemon in com

230
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,291
Laxmi is scared of everything.

231
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,264
But what's so strange about/that lemon?

232
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,361
Limejuice!

233
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,406
Our mom is very upset about/that bone and lemon

234
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,370
But I...

235
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,352
I'm hearing some voices.

236
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,237
What voices? /- I don't know.

237
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,275
Someone also cut my hair.

238
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,243
Cut your hair?

239
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,410
Your hair are same as they were before.

240
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,445
No Papa, you don't notice/my hair everyday.

241
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,291
Your hair are same.

242
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,297
Come, I'll put you to sleep.

243
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,367
First stop listening stories/from your Grandma.

244
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,359
Your brother is sleeping, /you too go to sleep.

245
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,259
Rajiv, that guy Mandaar.

246
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,389
Mandaar who?

247
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:12,266
Guy you appointed in Anshuman /and Madhu's pla

248
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,269
Yes then?

249
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,427
He was surveying the site.

250
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,274
Don't know how, while dumping rocks,

251
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,244
he fell and died under the rocks.

252
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,201
Children come here.

253
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,274
Rohan! I'm sorry for that.

254
00:57:37,649 --> 00:57:38,616
Everybody's upstairs.

255
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:41,676
Aarti what happened?

256
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:51,661
What happened, mother?

257
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,767
What happened? /In a man's voice...

258
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:04,836
I can't even understand anything.

259
00:58:10,882 --> 00:58:13,715
Papa, what is happening to sister?

260
00:58:13,819 --> 00:58:14,717
Nothing.

261
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:17,644
Your sister is ill.

262
00:58:21,693 --> 00:58:22,717
In which standard are you?

263
00:58:22,794 --> 00:58:23,761
5th standard.

264
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:28,622
Little bit here.

265
00:58:38,844 --> 00:58:40,835
What were you doing in your/class yesterday?

266
00:58:42,714 --> 00:58:43,806
It was a test yesterday.

267
00:58:44,716 --> 00:58:45,683
It was your test.

268
00:58:46,752 --> 00:58:47,741
Which subject?

269
00:58:49,821 --> 00:58:52,619
You didn't do well on the test.

270
00:58:53,892 --> 00:58:55,757
No, I did well. /You did well.

271
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:58,789
Sit up straight.

272
00:58:59,698 --> 00:59:01,632
Nice a little bit backward.

273
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:02,865
Look here.

274
00:59:05,804 --> 00:59:06,736
Now here.

275
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:27,791
What happened in school what/was it?

276
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,667
I think...

277
00:59:36,835 --> 00:59:39,702
...Your daughter...

278
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:41,798
...wasn't ready for her class/test.

279
00:59:42,808 --> 00:59:43,740
That's why.

280
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,709
In fact she came third in class/last year.

281
00:59:53,919 --> 00:59:57,650
I also came 1st in seventh class/and then...

282
00:59:57,756 --> 00:59:59,724
...21st in 8th class.

283
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:03,718
Things like these happens to/children.

284
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,868
Raksha behaving like this...

285
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:20,906
Our children...

286
01:00:22,714 --> 01:00:25,683
...they're someone else at home...

287
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:28,686
...and someone else outside the/home.

288
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,780
Ut doctor what about her laughing /in a man's voice

289
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:32,754
How is that?

290
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:36,659
Look it's abnormal of her to laugh /in a man's voice.

291
01:00:38,663 --> 01:00:39,630
And if she...

292
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:42,790
...laughed for long like you said.

293
01:00:43,668 --> 01:00:47,661
Possible that her throat is sore, /her voice pitch he

294
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:50,765
at when voice pitch gets/heavy people sound tota

295
01:00:51,676 --> 01:00:53,667
And probably after hearing that voice/people said...

296
01:00:53,812 --> 01:00:55,677
...that Raksha was laughing in a /man's voice.

297
01:01:19,771 --> 01:01:20,829
What happened to me?

298
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:23,673
Nothing.

299
01:01:25,677 --> 01:01:27,668
What did doctor uncle say?

300
01:01:29,881 --> 01:01:32,645
Doctor uncle was saying that/you're perfectly fine.

301
01:01:35,654 --> 01:01:36,621
No papa.

302
01:01:37,756 --> 01:01:38,780
I'm not fine.

303
01:01:39,825 --> 01:01:40,814
Something has happened to me.

304
01:01:44,663 --> 01:01:45,823
Nothing's wrong with you, Raksha.

305
01:01:46,765 --> 01:01:47,629
True.

306
01:02:07,886 --> 01:02:09,751
Go upstairs and sleep.

307
01:02:12,657 --> 01:02:12,884
Go.

308
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:23,632
What happened?

309
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:26,728
What did doctor say?

310
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:30,733
She'll be fine, mother.

311
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:33,777
It's black magic.

312
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:41,876
What? /Yes Rajeev.

313
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:44,780
Don't be blind.

314
01:02:45,624 --> 01:02:46,648
There is something.

315
01:02:46,825 --> 01:02:47,792
The other day...

316
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,794
...Raksha went missing suddenly.

317
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:53,857
And then this lemon and bone in /the compound.

318
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:55,631
And...

319
01:02:56,635 --> 01:02:57,727
Now all this at the school.

320
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,871
If not black magic then what is it?

321
01:03:04,676 --> 01:03:10,615
Mother, stop watching useless programs/on TV.

322
01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:47,677
Mother.

323
01:04:50,715 --> 01:04:52,683
You're doing all this.

324
01:04:52,717 --> 01:04:53,684
What?

325
01:04:55,653 --> 01:04:55,880
No

326
01:04:56,788 --> 01:04:57,846
You're doing this.

327
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,651
Laxmi. Yes Ma'am. /Serve the breakfast.

328
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:50,666
Papa.

329
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:53,804
Upstairs.

330
01:06:54,873 --> 01:06:55,862
What happened to your sister?

331
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:02,670
Rajeev what happened?

332
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:16,703
I know a doctor.

333
01:10:18,676 --> 01:10:19,768
Doctor Seema.

334
01:11:18,669 --> 01:11:19,863
You're not Raksha.

335
01:11:34,886 --> 01:11:35,784
Who are you?

336
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,786
Where is Raksha?

337
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:51,634
I have her.

338
01:11:52,804 --> 01:11:54,795
Can I talk to her?

339
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:23,817
What's the problem doctor? /What do you mean?

340
01:13:24,896 --> 01:13:26,761
Can't you people see.

341
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:28,892
That she's possessed.

342
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:32,635
Don't believe in all this blind faith.

343
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,795
I'm not in a blind faith.

344
01:13:34,906 --> 01:13:36,635
You people are blind.

345
01:13:36,707 --> 01:13:39,835
Ery human being has his own /thinking and emotio

346
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:42,611
Which is their identity.

347
01:13:42,813 --> 01:13:45,805
Ike your thinking and views are/different then me

348
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:47,879
Which makes your identity.

349
01:13:49,687 --> 01:13:50,745
Now in Raksha's case.

350
01:13:55,793 --> 01:13:56,851
In cases like these.

351
01:13:57,695 --> 01:14:00,858
Some of the thoughts and view of/mind.

352
01:14:01,832 --> 01:14:03,697
Becomes totally different.

353
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:09,797
Seems to us that these/people have different pers

354
01:14:10,641 --> 01:14:12,666
Because their behavior.

355
01:14:14,645 --> 01:14:15,839
Even their way of speaking

356
01:14:16,714 --> 01:14:17,806
Changes suddenly.

357
01:14:24,655 --> 01:14:28,887
T I'm telling you that it's all /because she's possess

358
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,685
Yes, she's possessed.

359
01:14:42,673 --> 01:14:43,765
Like ghosts and black magic.

360
01:14:44,675 --> 01:14:46,666
If you want to call it possession.

361
01:14:46,844 --> 01:14:48,607
Sure call it that.

362
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:49,873
But it's not real.

363
01:14:50,715 --> 01:14:54,674
It's only in the mind. /But it's still possession.

364
01:16:06,857 --> 01:16:10,691
She'll stay on sedative for a few hours.

365
01:16:12,763 --> 01:16:14,628
After that she'll be okay.

366
01:16:16,901 --> 01:16:18,869
Don't be nervous.

367
01:16:21,806 --> 01:16:23,797
Once the treatment starts.

368
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:27,838
She'll definitely start getting better.

369
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,840
Doctor Panday I need to conduct/some tests.

370
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,688
For that we'll have to take her/to the hospital.

371
01:16:37,822 --> 01:16:40,689
What's going to happen after/tests?

372
01:16:40,891 --> 01:16:43,689
Can't you see what's happening /to my child?

373
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:47,730
It's black magic.

374
01:16:50,768 --> 01:16:55,728
S common in black magic that/they make fabric d

375
01:16:55,873 --> 01:17:00,810
And they put magical spell on it/and break it's arm

376
01:17:01,879 --> 01:17:03,744
When will you understand?

377
01:19:12,743 --> 01:19:13,732
You don't believe all this.

378
01:19:14,645 --> 01:19:16,670
But I believe in GOD.

379
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,806
I truly believe in GOD.

380
01:19:21,752 --> 01:19:23,845
And if there's GOD, Rajeev...

381
01:19:24,655 --> 01:19:26,714
...then there's also devil.

382
01:19:28,893 --> 01:19:31,862
And if today because of that evil /force...

383
01:19:33,697 --> 01:19:37,599
Il of this happening to my child /then what is he doi

384
01:19:44,742 --> 01:19:49,679
er years of my faith in him. /Why isn't he doing an

385
01:19:58,722 --> 01:20:01,714
She's just a child. /She's small.

386
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,694
And all of this with her.

387
01:20:06,664 --> 01:20:07,722
You're quiet.

388
01:20:19,643 --> 01:20:23,773
Aarti, GOD test us sometimes.

389
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,631
S good that there's no physical /problem in the brai

390
01:23:40,811 --> 01:23:43,712
It's related to an old incident.

391
01:23:43,914 --> 01:23:45,779
And it's painful memories.

392
01:23:49,653 --> 01:23:51,780
And when it tries to rise up.

393
01:23:52,623 --> 01:23:55,786
And suddenly human behavior changes.

394
01:23:57,861 --> 01:23:59,658
She's possessed.

395
01:24:00,898 --> 01:24:02,889
I think in Raksha's case.

396
01:24:03,901 --> 01:24:05,892
Her Grandmother's blind belief.

397
01:24:06,904 --> 01:24:08,599
Her

398
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:16,668
ral stories and superstitious/thinking has so much

399
01:24:18,682 --> 01:24:22,709
And lemon and bone being /found in your house.

400
01:24:23,687 --> 01:24:24,847
And her going missing suddenly.

401
01:24:25,722 --> 01:24:26,689
Her fear.

402
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,757
That someone will come and /cut her hair off.

403
01:24:30,694 --> 01:24:33,857
She has deep a effect of all this/on her mind.

404
01:24:40,737 --> 01:24:45,606
I need some time to resolve this.

405
01:24:54,685 --> 01:24:56,676
Treatment takes time.

406
01:25:02,659 --> 01:25:03,717
Have faith in doctors.

407
01:25:17,741 --> 01:25:18,708
I'm telling you.

408
01:25:19,643 --> 01:25:20,837
Nothing will happen.

409
01:26:00,651 --> 01:26:01,675
What's all this?

410
01:26:04,755 --> 01:26:05,779
Get up.

411
01:26:10,794 --> 01:26:12,625
What freak have brought?

412
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:14,824
Get out from here.

413
01:26:16,767 --> 01:26:18,860
Fool, your daughter will die.

414
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,638
Try to understand.

415
01:26:30,647 --> 01:26:31,807
Your daughter will die.

416
01:27:29,706 --> 01:27:31,674
Someone is hitting me.

417
01:30:01,758 --> 01:30:06,752
Ju I know that you don't/believe in GOD and super

418
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:10,696
But Raju, whatever is happening...

419
01:30:14,738 --> 01:30:18,640
Okay all of your faith in science/and technology.

420
01:30:18,675 --> 01:30:22,634
Can't find a solution even /after having all those d

421
01:30:22,746 --> 01:30:24,839
Shouldn't we be looking for/another solution?

422
01:30:25,882 --> 01:30:28,817
Just look at Raksha. /What state she's in?

423
01:30:30,687 --> 01:30:34,623
Meone who can undo what's/happening to Raksh

424
01:30:46,703 --> 01:30:47,727
I've found out.

425
01:30:54,744 --> 01:30:55,870
Kill her.

426
01:31:00,717 --> 01:31:02,776
It's better than letting her/live like this.

427
01:31:06,756 --> 01:31:09,657
Hese tests and treatments won't/change anything

428
01:31:12,729 --> 01:31:14,856
It's black magic.

429
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,668
And no one can do anything /about it.

430
01:31:18,902 --> 01:31:19,834
Not even GOD.

431
01:31:21,671 --> 01:31:22,638
I can understand.

432
01:31:22,906 --> 01:31:26,740
What are you going through.

433
01:31:36,786 --> 01:31:42,622
Ut things like these never produce/results in tests

434
01:31:44,761 --> 01:31:49,789
at doesn't mean that we/should believe in black

435
01:31:51,668 --> 01:31:53,727
If we started believe in things like/this.

436
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:35,644
Trust me.

437
01:32:36,746 --> 01:32:39,681
Raksha will get better.

438
01:34:07,771 --> 01:34:09,739
Child is in pain.

439
01:34:16,713 --> 01:34:17,839
Your daughter.

440
01:34:19,816 --> 01:34:22,717
How do you know? /Don't ask foolish question.

441
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:34,856
You're an atheist.

442
01:34:39,769 --> 01:34:40,701
I don't know.

443
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:43,628
What is GOD?

444
01:34:48,778 --> 01:34:51,747
What do you do when you /have a fever?

445
01:34:55,752 --> 01:34:56,719
I take medicine.

446
01:34:58,688 --> 01:35:00,656
What's in that medicine?

447
01:35:02,659 --> 01:35:04,786
I don't know. /Without knowing...

448
01:35:04,828 --> 01:35:06,853
...what's in the medicine...

449
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:08,654
...you eat it.

450
01:35:08,798 --> 01:35:10,698
That your fever will go away.

451
01:35:10,767 --> 01:35:15,727
You just believe what parents and /doctors said.

452
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:16,866
Then...

453
01:35:17,874 --> 01:35:22,743
the difference between /believing in medicine and

454
01:35:24,747 --> 01:35:26,612
Do you have an answer?

455
01:35:31,788 --> 01:35:34,689
Not everything has an answer.

456
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,735
Where is your daughter?

457
01:35:52,642 --> 01:35:52,869
In the hospital.

458
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:31,643
Who is he and what is he/doing here?

459
01:36:31,781 --> 01:36:33,772
Black magic for sure.

460
01:36:37,687 --> 01:36:39,621
It's beyond your understanding.

461
01:36:49,632 --> 01:36:50,758
You brought him here.

462
01:36:58,741 --> 01:36:59,901
Time is very short.

463
01:37:02,712 --> 01:37:04,680
Take me to your house.

464
01:37:05,848 --> 01:37:06,746
My house?

465
01:40:21,644 --> 01:40:22,633
Black magic.

466
01:40:27,683 --> 01:40:28,843
I didn't listen to you, mother.

467
01:41:31,814 --> 01:41:33,679
Your daughter...

468
01:41:34,784 --> 01:41:36,752
...is going to die.

469
01:41:41,757 --> 01:41:43,816
What the hell? /What are you saying?

470
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:49,654
Someone is trying to get a /revenge from you.

471
01:41:49,732 --> 01:41:50,699
Who?

472
01:41:53,803 --> 01:41:55,862
And he's not just one person /they're two.

473
01:41:58,674 --> 01:42:00,767
A man and a woman.

474
01:42:03,879 --> 01:42:05,642
Anshuman and Madhu!

475
01:42:08,784 --> 01:42:10,649
The one who's helping them...

476
01:42:11,921 --> 01:42:15,721
...is one of your own man.

477
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:31,630
I made a huge mistake, sir.

478
01:42:38,814 --> 01:42:40,782
He site where workers wanted /to build a temple...

479
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:42,884
Build it.

480
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:08,626
Stop this right now or I'll /kill you.

481
01:45:11,767 --> 01:45:15,703
I don't need black magic or/GOD to kill you.

482
01:50:16,905 --> 01:50:19,738
Papa... /All this...

483
01:50:20,709 --> 01:50:21,733
Nothing.

484
01:50:40,696 --> 01:50:41,856
If today Raksha is with us.

485
01:50:42,765 --> 01:50:43,663
She's okay.

486
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:46,725
Just because of Dr. Seema.
