1
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:56,655
How thin she looks

2
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,853
Even her nose tapered down

3
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:07,595
If only she
needn't be cremated

4
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:14,470
But that's impossible

5
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:17,511
No, not mad

6
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:25,751
Just raving

7
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,465
Never before such a clear mind

8
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:46,270
Never before, so clear

9
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:01,421
Revolver

10
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:06,789
Nothing broken

11
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:20,607
Just a handful of blood

12
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:56,334
The cabinet where
the lamp always burns

13
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:02,071
A corner for the accounts

14
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,037
Another room to sleep in

15
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:07,706
A shelf full of books

16
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,989
and a safe. The keys...

17
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,916
.. I keep
- kept.

18
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:24,560
You?

19
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,663
What is this?

20
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:43,276
What have you brought?

21
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,189
What is this you've brought?

22
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:09,409
They only take gold and silver

23
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:19,084
They won't even talk to me

24
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,822
I don't want anything
from you either.

25
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:39,770
Perhaps...

26
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:43,275
.. it didn't actually
happen like this

27
00:07:46,604 --> 00:07:49,016
But it must all
have happened...

28
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,448
"without thought

29
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:58,322
I had heard everything

30
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:19,079
Shane won't touch it

31
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:31,119
But I'll take it. For you.

32
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:38,356
Advertise in the morning.
You're employed by evening

33
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:45,766
Young woman seeks employment

34
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:52,476
Can take care of children

35
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:37,924
Not of any one else...

36
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:44,999
I'm talking about her alone

37
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:53,701
Then it would all have stayed like that
- just like that

38
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:27,233
Keep this at home.
Leave just the case.

39
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,225
I have no room here for Gods.

40
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:47,856
Is it forbidden?

41
00:10:47,918 --> 00:10:49,090
No

42
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:55,128
No...

43
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:00,107
But perhaps you
would rather not

44
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:02,203
You can keep it

45
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,111
No, I won't do that

46
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,250
I tell you

47
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:22,424
I won't do that

48
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:27,665
I'll keep this in the
cabinet with the others

49
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:32,603
Where the lamp is burning

50
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:36,834
Take two thousand
and the deal is done

51
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:42,442
One is enough

52
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:51,050
This stone must have lain
with luminous fish in water

53
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,454
My condition...

54
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:59,260
...was as strained as yours

55
00:12:04,662 --> 00:12:10,544
But now all that
you see around

56
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:16,282
So now you are taking revenge

57
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,146
He who wishes the
worst for himself

58
00:12:22,747 --> 00:12:23,851
Who said that?

59
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:25,955
Does good to others

60
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:35,870
This age is not like that...

61
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,303
Stop. I've heard
this before...

62
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,437
Have you read it?

63
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:42,904
It's possible...

64
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:45,539
Where Mir...

65
00:12:45,636 --> 00:12:46,706
Where...

66
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,812
An antique dealer is
always an antique dealer

67
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:53,349
How strange you are!

68
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,481
I didn't think of that at all

69
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:58,389
One person inside
another outside

70
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,332
One can do good
in any walk of life

71
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:07,261
I'm not talking of myself

72
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,032
What of evil!

73
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:15,702
I'm incapable
of doing anything

74
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:41,555
My gaze...

75
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:50,804
.. always discreet

76
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:03,485
Then why do I feel
twisted inside?

77
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,347
I haven't changed

78
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:10,021
There's still
compassion within me

79
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:15,019
The grocer is on the look-out

80
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:20,159
For a dark, mute creature
who can take care of his

81
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:23,666
motherless children.

82
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:29,710
This girl is quiet.
Bred in poverty he says

83
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:32,641
He's marrying for the
sake of the children.

84
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,806
The poor thing is terrified

85
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:41,455
That's when she was raising
money for the advertisements

86
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:47,618
I am running a shop.
But I want something else

87
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:50,962
I don't speak to anyone

88
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:55,301
I don't stare at faces

89
00:15:58,395 --> 00:16:01,638
Yesterday there
I was in my shop

90
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:06,405
I know the entire circumstance

91
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:14,483
I have always assessed myself

92
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,554
I am assessing myself

93
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,857
There is something...

94
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,066
.. I want to tell you about

95
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:36,871
Why are you quiet?

96
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,808
Wait, I'm thinking

97
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,757
She blushed

98
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
But her eyes were blazing

99
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,994
I liked that

100
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,532
But by then I was sure. She
did come back. To the shop

101
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:11,312
Now it's coming back.
Every little details

102
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:14,141
I remember

103
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,518
I haven't forgotten

104
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,590
As soon as she left
I made up my mind

105
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,356
I had given Bua some money

106
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:35,396
A bribe!

107
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:20,542
There is for me

108
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:24,316
some work in Goa

109
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,833
I am taking her away

110
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:45,169
She has nothing.
And wants nothing

111
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:48,875
I'll arrange that

112
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:54,547
Absolutely nothing won't do

113
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:06,455
My childhood wasn't
spent in this house.

114
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:07,621
I know

115
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:12,523
Your parents died
three years ago

116
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:20,073
There is something
I want to say to you

117
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:30,780
Youth is generous...

118
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,548
But it has no tolerance

119
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:46,528
Now how do I explain to you
what it is to lend money?

120
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,896
Perhaps I understand

121
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:55,836
The truth?

122
00:19:58,702 --> 00:19:59,874
The truth is...

123
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:21,730
I want you to know me...

124
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:25,699
As I am

125
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:14,620
From the beginning
we were both silent

126
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:18,727
There were no
quarrels. Just silence

127
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:25,264
She would steal glances at
me. I was more silent than ever

128
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:28,836
Yes, I was the one who
wanted silence. Not she.

129
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:37,035
It's true. The generosity
of youth is splendid

130
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:49,949
But just try a feat of
generosity that's hard, quiet

131
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:56,121
and without a flourish...

132
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:51,041
Opens not The door of accord

133
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:52,813
As of now

134
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:57,625
Wounded my desire
In orbit spread

135
00:22:58,415 --> 00:22:59,485
As of now

136
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,764
Have shattered
Flint-heart you

137
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:07,895
Someone's fragile heart

138
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,767
O bruised heart, in
your lane the distant cry

139
00:23:14,698 --> 00:23:15,870
As of now

140
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:26,015
Within his cusped
palm was my blood

141
00:23:27,444 --> 00:23:28,616
So drank off

142
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:33,684
Never in flight Is
the henna-stained bird

143
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:37,256
As of now

144
00:23:56,206 --> 00:23:57,549
She used to come
to sell a few things

145
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,150
To raise some
money for herself

146
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,351
That was at the very beginning

147
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:06,653
I didn't notice her as
different from the others

148
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,123
As soon as she got her money
she turned and walked out

149
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,036
Always in silence.
Or so it seemed to me

150
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,585
They have all left me

151
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:18,362
Forgotten me. That's good

152
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:24,230
How they humiliated me!

153
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,107
A shop-keeper!

154
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:36,075
You say it. Everyone says it.

155
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:41,180
So what? That you
are a shopkeeper

156
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,156
Let them say what they want

157
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:47,286
If somebody..

158
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,791
.. would find a meaning...

159
00:25:57,394 --> 00:25:58,532
Whatever they want

160
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:01,837
You can't stop
anyone. Anyone at all

161
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:19,760
My understanding
is without reason

162
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,424
Certain ideas...

163
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:31,806
.. when spoken may sound
foolish and inexplicable

164
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:41,012
What ideas? Why should they?

165
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:51,525
Because we are not
capable of listening

166
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:55,895
Perhaps even I
have not understood

167
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:58,825
But this much is true

168
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:03,567
If you follow a straight
path you will reach

169
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,200
These small minds!

170
00:27:11,835 --> 00:27:14,315
Among ten thousands barely
one or two will make it

171
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:28,587
Who started it?

172
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:31,391
No one

173
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:15,548
Why did she, in
certain things...

174
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,250
.. in sheets, for instance..

175
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:20,953
.. or in cleanliness..?

176
00:31:21,484 --> 00:31:25,489
She didn't realize how
her face was swelling

177
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:31,394
No one will believe how
closely I observed her

178
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:11,205
I want to get to..

179
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:17,912
.. the bottom of all
this... all this filth

180
00:32:25,148 --> 00:32:29,426
Forty equal to seventeen

181
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:42,371
Women have nothing
of their own

182
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:50,140
This is to blame for it all

183
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:16,200
I was forty. She seventeen

184
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:24,350
This was on her mind

185
00:36:02,865 --> 00:36:04,173
She must have in your eyes...

186
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:45,311
You overvalue things

187
00:36:48,377 --> 00:36:49,583
Then argue with me about it

188
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:13,845
These things are
not worth so much

189
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,821
I speak little but I am firm

190
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:36,494
This money is mine

191
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:46,438
There's no profit from this

192
00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:55,049
When I brought you here I
made no secret of anything

193
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:40,865
From now on I forbid you...

194
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,338
...to interfere in my work

195
00:40:59,762 --> 00:41:01,298
Today she went out first
thing in the morning

196
00:41:01,864 --> 00:41:03,002
Yesterday too

197
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:08,607
I locked up the
shop and came here.

198
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:18,050
But she isn't here either

199
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,494
There is an officer
- Yamanuj

200
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:27,294
From the same regiment as you

201
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:32,097
He's got something
to do with it

202
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:35,669
Yamanuj!

203
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,076
He had come to the shop

204
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:45,208
A meeting has been arranged

205
00:41:47,376 --> 00:41:49,652
At the home of Julia
Samson the colonel's widow

206
00:43:33,382 --> 00:43:35,089
You were thrown
out of the Army

207
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,294
it's true
- Why?

208
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:44,394
I refused to eat...

209
00:43:48,664 --> 00:43:50,234
You were afraid to fight

210
00:43:57,106 --> 00:44:01,486
A summary court-martial
gives the verdict

211
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:05,553
The papers are filled from
before. Even the judgement

212
00:44:08,317 --> 00:44:09,660
During the Mutiny of
1857 the British...

213
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:12,392
For three years after you
roamed the streets of Bombay

214
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:17,363
I did not break

215
00:44:18,627 --> 00:44:19,697
It has all passed

216
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:50,202
The papers are filled from
before. Even the judgement

217
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:57,473
In 1857 the British...

218
00:45:39,975 --> 00:45:41,648
White flowers...

219
00:45:45,748 --> 00:45:47,091
...on the bed-sheet

220
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:19,288
She didn't sing very well.
she was often out of tune

221
00:46:24,186 --> 00:46:26,393
In a muffled tone
she sang softly

222
00:46:27,289 --> 00:46:29,269
I used to listen
standing outside

223
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,596
She hides that
fact that the sings

224
00:46:35,297 --> 00:46:37,072
She knows only this one song

225
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,273
She is searching for
something. I don't know...

226
00:47:26,014 --> 00:47:27,755
I'm not at all
quiet or soft-spoken

227
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:46,510
You come too abruptly to the point
- very coarsely

228
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:07,794
I'm not sure about that.
But I'm certainly disgusted

229
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:18,441
I found what I imagined

230
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:57,077
Did you see that?

231
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,813
Not really. I'm quite well

232
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:49,111
You're frail and weak...

233
00:56:51,813 --> 00:56:52,985
Face so pale...

234
00:56:59,154 --> 00:57:00,155
Lips almost white

235
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:01,459
I am quite, quite well

236
00:57:39,394 --> 00:57:41,396
Mir Taqi Mir

237
00:57:53,141 --> 00:57:54,245
How shall I know why...

238
00:57:55,944 --> 00:57:59,050
My heart is drawn out so

239
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:04,323
From childhood

240
00:58:06,754 --> 00:58:08,062
From my childhood

241
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:23,274
By myself

242
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:27,879
On holidays

243
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:40,342
it's as though I have
passed years like this

244
01:00:41,209 --> 01:00:42,347
Even I... the same

245
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:55,263
You, on your side
of the table...

246
01:00:57,659 --> 01:00:58,865
I at mine

247
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:07,903
And so it would have
remained for years.

248
01:01:08,536 --> 01:01:10,015
The same

249
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:18,050
But suddenly I entered

250
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:47,475
Why did I go out?

251
01:01:52,947 --> 01:01:54,051
For our tickets...

252
01:02:00,221 --> 01:02:01,427
And what a crowd
there was there!

253
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,864
How they stared at me...

254
01:02:16,704 --> 01:02:17,876
The grocer or me?

255
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:25,214
A shop-keeper and
a money-lender...

256
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:32,089
...who could
quote a little Mir

257
01:03:14,328 --> 01:03:18,071
And I thought it would
all remain like that

258
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,574
I'll take you to Goa

259
01:03:22,403 --> 01:03:23,541
In a little while

260
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:34,959
Your voice is cracked

261
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:39,157
I just heard it

262
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,333
I'll close down the shop

263
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:50,068
No, don't say anything

264
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:57,212
I can't rest in any position

265
01:04:54,362 --> 01:04:55,670
But I could not
have kept quiet

266
01:04:59,267 --> 01:05:00,746
That I could be there
and not say anything.

267
01:05:10,811 --> 01:05:12,757
I was delighted
just listening to you

268
01:05:14,615 --> 01:05:16,151
You are exaggerating

269
01:05:22,757 --> 01:05:23,861
I cannot stop myself

270
01:05:27,395 --> 01:05:28,931
I tell you I was so happy...

271
01:05:31,732 --> 01:05:34,679
.. there behind
the door, hiding...

272
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,185
...listening to you

273
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:50,660
There behind the door

274
01:05:54,088 --> 01:05:58,400
My eyes on your feet...

275
01:06:00,828 --> 01:06:04,071
.. my ears to your voice

276
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:09,037
Listening to you

277
01:06:13,507 --> 01:06:16,784
I was lost in your
intelligence...

278
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:22,853
.. and child-like innocence

279
01:06:28,689 --> 01:06:29,861
You are killing me

280
01:06:37,131 --> 01:06:38,542
I think of you as
much greater than me

281
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:48,644
I want to live only with you

282
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,344
I could have taken up a job

283
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:23,887
But after being in uniform...

284
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:26,651
I decided...

285
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:31,125
on the antique shop and
the money-lending business

286
01:07:35,156 --> 01:07:36,294
When I brought you home...

287
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:37,862
I thought I was
bringing a friend

288
01:07:41,062 --> 01:07:42,132
What is it?

289
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:45,403
What is it?

290
01:07:46,667 --> 01:07:48,943
This hand has gone to sleep
under the weight of my head

291
01:07:55,176 --> 01:07:56,416
Again, today
there is an evening

292
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:00,816
Today again there
is an evening

293
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:06,728
I probably seem strange to you

294
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:09,994
Nothing wrong

295
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:15,899
The trouble is
that I am a dreamer

296
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:25,142
.. with difficulty

297
01:08:28,142 --> 01:08:30,816
My indecision every
time, on every occasion

298
01:08:33,647 --> 01:08:35,058
Whatever happened,
happened by chance

299
01:08:37,318 --> 01:08:38,854
And there's nothing
more terrifying!

300
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:42,392
To perish by chance!

301
01:08:44,358 --> 01:08:45,462
For something could
have happened...

302
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:48,131
.. if it hadn't...

303
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,803
I would have blown
by like breeze

304
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:57,107
Had you any hope of survival?

305
01:08:58,105 --> 01:09:00,517
My reply, as before
God, I had no hope at all

306
01:09:04,745 --> 01:09:06,588
Why were you ready
to accept death?

307
01:09:08,182 --> 01:09:09,388
I ask you.

308
01:09:12,753 --> 01:09:15,597
I know it. And you too.

309
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:18,603
If you can guess the truth

310
01:09:21,695 --> 01:09:23,265
I was not asleep then

311
01:09:34,074 --> 01:09:35,781
Perhaps it didn't
actually happen like this

312
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,597
But it must have
surely happened

313
01:09:57,264 --> 01:09:58,538
Even without thinking

314
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:12,752
I myself was about to perish

315
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:19,259
So who could I try to save?

316
01:10:25,826 --> 01:10:29,706
But I had heard it all
- known it all

317
01:12:17,571 --> 01:12:18,743
Before me!

318
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:27,150
She's forgotten me...

319
01:12:36,056 --> 01:12:37,194
So she sings

320
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:41,070
Is this the first time?

321
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,101
No. She does sing

322
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:48,774
When you are not here

323
01:13:01,648 --> 01:13:02,752
She's singing

324
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:08,360
Does she sing?

325
01:13:10,391 --> 01:13:11,597
Before me!

326
01:15:18,952 --> 01:15:20,260
Weren't you surprised
when you heard...?

327
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:27,299
That day in the evening,
I lost my courage

328
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,294
To you...

329
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:35,233
Please talk

330
01:16:37,864 --> 01:16:39,275
Say something to me

331
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:51,245
I see everything, clearly

332
01:16:52,913 --> 01:16:54,051
To the last detail

333
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:03,196
My despair. Before you

334
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:08,169
About myself.
About you and Bua

335
01:17:13,834 --> 01:17:15,074
I am weeping...

336
01:17:18,672 --> 01:17:20,276
Why do you say I
never see anything?

337
01:17:59,713 --> 01:18:01,090
I'll go away..

338
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:13,300
I can't stay here any longer

339
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:46,499
Cannot sleep.

340
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:21,632
You...

341
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:23,267
Bua, wait!

342
01:19:42,315 --> 01:19:43,419
Are you all right?

343
01:19:48,054 --> 01:19:49,226
Never mind, you may go

344
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:06,277
What has happened to you?

345
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,146
Nothing...

346
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,689
You...

347
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:51,094
I was looking at her

348
01:20:51,852 --> 01:20:53,024
She turned...

349
01:20:54,654 --> 01:20:55,826
.. and then out!

350
01:21:05,465 --> 01:21:06,671
It's damp outside!

351
01:23:41,388 --> 01:23:43,197
You were here, too
