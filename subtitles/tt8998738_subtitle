1
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:36,255
My love, I lost to you.

2
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,255
You have won my heart.

3
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:44,171
Why, then, do you still fight me?

4
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:50,546
I have lost repeatedly to you, my love.

5
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:56,005
Let it go, my love.

6
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:59,505
My amour...

7
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:02,130
My sweetheart...

8
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:07,546
Let's talk, my love.
Please talk, my love.

9
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,796
Let me speak a little.
You listen a little.

10
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:41,838
You chat a little, too...
Let me listen.

11
00:02:42,046 --> 00:02:44,546
Why do you sulk, my love?

12
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,380
I try, but you are so stubborn!

13
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:52,630
This is the time for love.
Why are you peeved?

14
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,046
My amour...

15
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,671
My sweetheart...

16
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:04,213
Let's talk, my love.
Please talk, my love.

17
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,546
Do you know how much
cigarettes cost nowadays?

18
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,046
Probably less than lung cancer treatment.

19
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:56,088
This city's pollution
will give us cancer anyway.

20
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,880
If not now, then ten years later.

21
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,296
Scold me.

22
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:01,296
What?

23
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,588
I'm late right? So scold me now,

24
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:06,546
else you'll look for
excuses to vent it out.

25
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:10,630
I know it. So don't keep me on edge.
Scold me and be done with it.

26
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:12,546
Don't try to be my boss.

27
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,338
I'll do whatever, whenever I want to.

28
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,630
Let's go.

29
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,505
That's a nice dress.

30
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,630
You noticed? Nice, isn't it?

31
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:48,338
I told Sunita.

32
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,546
Of late, all she does is
find fault with me, jealous bitch!

33
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:54,463
She had a break up, right?

34
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,463
Give her a few weeks,
she'll find another idiot to trap.

35
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:00,921
What do you mean?

36
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,171
Sunita isn't like that.

37
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:06,005
Her ex-boyfriend was just an asshole.

38
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:12,921
Whenever he dropped her at the hostel,
he'd leer at me, that pig.

39
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:19,088
When I'd tell Sunita, she'd get mad at me.
As if I was enticing him!

40
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,713
Always falls for the wrong guys,
that poor girl.

41
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:26,130
Good for her.

42
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:29,380
Before she gets bored of the guy,
the guy dumps her

43
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,380
Everyone stays happy!

44
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,630
Happy?

45
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:35,755
That's your problem.

46
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:40,421
You barely meet someone,
and you instantly judge them.

47
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,838
About everything - who they are,
what they do...

48
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:47,130
Poor Sunita.

49
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:50,963
I know how hard the break-up was on her.

50
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,088
She even attempted suicide twice.

51
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,338
You won't understand!

52
00:05:56,796 --> 00:05:59,005
Some people just love being fucked over.

53
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:01,880
They're addicted to suffering.

54
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:06,255
Your dear Sunita is of the same breed.

55
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:09,421
There's no drama in her life -

56
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:12,630
The same boring job and salary.

57
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:14,963
Love. Sex. Fights, Breakups.

58
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,088
That's how she entertains herself.

59
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:20,421
Mark my words,
she'll have at least two marriages,

60
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,296
four extramarital affairs
and three divorces.

61
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,755
You never find anything good in anyone.

62
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:30,671
What's good and bad in this?

63
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:34,546
And when did I claim to
be arbiter of absolute truth?

64
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:38,505
Doesn't everyone judge one another?

65
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:41,005
I just don't make any bones about it.

66
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:46,255
If you really think of it, you'll find
vices in Aamir Khan (film actor)

67
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,338
and virtues in Salman Khan (film actor).

68
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:51,088
What matters is whose film is a hit.

69
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:56,421
Also, a film that seems stupid now,
could become a future classic

70
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,213
and one that's great
now might age terribly.

71
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:07,546
Earlier, women pursuing education
were berated. That's no longer the case.

72
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,463
The future could turn the tables again.

73
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:13,838
If ideas of good
and bad can change with time...

74
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:16,463
Why must I carry the burden of morality?

75
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:19,130
Stop preaching. Tell me frankly...

76
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:24,171
Everyone has something good in them,
right?

77
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:26,713
So tell me what you like about Sunita?

78
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,505
Tell me!

79
00:07:31,588 --> 00:07:32,588
Her voice.

80
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:34,880
Her voice?

81
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,421
It's so hoarse.

82
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:46,588
Like Vidya Balan, Priyanka Chopra,
Rani Mukherjee...

83
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,255
So did I say she sounds like
Lata Mangeshkar,

84
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,088
Shreya Ghoshal or Kavita Krishnamurti?

85
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,171
So?

86
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:58,963
That's what! When she gets fucked,
imagine how hot she sounds!

87
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,963
How many times have I told
you not to talk dirty about women?

88
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,671
It's not dirty.

89
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,546
Right. "Not dirty. Just truth!"

90
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:11,005
Correct.

91
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:17,171
And not just girls and sex, I speak
my mind about anything and everything.

92
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,713
And it'll be a crime if you don't?

93
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:21,796
Yes!

94
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:26,088
For work's sake, I've stopped
being completely honest with the world.

95
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:29,963
I'll have to do the same with you,
with this attitude of yours.

96
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:33,630
And if that happens,
I'll end up barely talking to you.

97
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,880
Fine. Say whatever you want.
I won't say a thing.

98
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,921
No, say it. What's the fun otherwise?

99
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:42,171
So you hurt me just for fun?

100
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,588
Look. No, actually just listen.
And understand this now.

101
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:53,213
You have some delusions about
how life is and should be!

102
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,546
If you didn't have them,
you wouldn't get hurt.

103
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,421
I don't say anything
to intentionally hurt you.

104
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:04,338
But when you hurt yourself
with your stupidity, it delights me.

105
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:07,588
It's as funny as watching one's
own father slip on a banana peel.

106
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:13,796
Slipping can break one's bones too,
you know.

107
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:19,088
I love you - which is why I tolerate you.

108
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:21,713
If it was someone else, I'd most likely...

109
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,088
If it wasn't you,
even I'd be different, wouldn't I?

110
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:38,088
Where are we going?

111
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:45,671
What road are we travelling?
What road are we travelling?

112
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:51,380
There's no destination in sight...

113
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:57,088
There's no destination in sight...

114
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,171
Tell me.

115
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:01,630
You really don't know?

116
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:02,671
No.

117
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,421
I had messaged you.

118
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,838
I told you I'm facing
issues with WhatsApp!

119
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:12,546
Even my boss's message about
the meeting reached me this morning.

120
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,546
I had to run out without breakfast.

121
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:17,171
And they don't let us
check our phones in office.

122
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:19,046
That's good.

123
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:22,505
Smartphones are only
making people more stupid.

124
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,213
Don't you also use a smartphone?

125
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:26,380
I have business with stupid people.

126
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:29,130
Why should I sacrifice
my business for my beliefs?

127
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,880
Just tell me where we are going!

128
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:39,921
Tell me this, if you didn't know where
we're headed, why didn't you ask before?

129
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:43,630
How does it matter...
as long as you're with me, love!

130
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:47,171
And yet you did ask.

131
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,796
It's pointless speaking to you.

132
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:58,171
We're going to Gulshan CafÃ©.

133
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,338
I haven't eaten a thing
since morning either.

134
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:01,880
Why, love?

135
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:04,713
Some clients had come to meet Malvani.

136
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:07,505
Who Malvani? The CA?

137
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,338
Didn't you guys fight the last time?

138
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:11,921
Yes, we did.

139
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:12,963
Then?

140
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:16,630
He's also a hardcore CA.

141
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,588
And from a community known for shrewdness.

142
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:20,921
He knew I was in a tight spot.

143
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:24,338
His dumb ass-licking employees
are good for nothing.

144
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:30,255
He had no option but to hire me to convert
his client's black money into white.

145
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,130
You'll get a fat commission now, right?

146
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,380
Fat my ass! Whatever I earn,
half will go into paying loans.

147
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,296
The rest must be saved until the next job.

148
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,921
You were the one crazy about stocks
and Bitcoin! Betting your money online.

149
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:50,588
Didn't I warn you against gambling?

150
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,546
Must be fun telling me, "I told you so!"
"I told you so!"

151
00:11:57,713 --> 00:12:01,213
You think I'm happy that you lost money?

152
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,796
Because I act smart in front of you,

153
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:09,338
must be fun to see me fail.

154
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:12,171
Anyway,

155
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:14,505
no use crying over spilled milk.

156
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:17,005
This country's economy is fucked anyway.

157
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:21,630
Big businessmen are taking money
from banks and fleeing the country...

158
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:24,713
Or just saving their asses
by bribing the government.

159
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,130
Till election funding is sorted out,
no party will touch these guys.

160
00:12:31,296 --> 00:12:33,838
News Channels have also
become pimps for these parties.

161
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,963
And these stupid voters will elect the
same guys who have fucked them in the ass.

162
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:43,921
Honesty and hard work
won't earn enough money.

163
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:48,213
That's why I invested in the share
market and Bitcoin. That didn't work.

164
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:51,463
Next time, I'll invest again.
Someday, I'll hit the jackpot.

165
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,713
Till then, you can scoff at me.

166
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,255
Okay fine. I'm sorry.

167
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,880
At least, today you made money, right?
Let's celebrate then.

168
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,296
So should I order you a chariot?

169
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,546
Isn't that why we are
going to CafÃ© Gulshan!

170
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:11,505
These cabbies have become
arrogant assholes! None will stop.

171
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,838
Listen,

172
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,213
Today I'll pay at the hotel.

173
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,463
For what joy?

174
00:13:20,546 --> 00:13:23,296
It'll be half and half like always.

175
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:26,505
Let it go. Today's a reason to celebrate.

176
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:29,255
That reason is mine. Not yours!

177
00:13:33,963 --> 00:13:35,921
Why do you talk like that?

178
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:40,671
Don't hurt me so much
that my heart breaks one day.

179
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,380
If your heart is so weak,
it is better if it breaks.

180
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:47,630
There's no place for
the weak in this world

181
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:49,171
I'm not weak.

182
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,046
You make me weak.

183
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:55,046
Blaming others for one's own weakness is
the first sign of a weak person, my dear.

184
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,421
Whether you read the Gita or the Quran.

185
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:04,005
If you take refuge in love to
hide your frailties, you've already lost.

186
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:08,130
I don't want your weakness
to affect me. Come on.

187
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,796
Can you never speak nicely to me?

188
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,963
Do you never get bored
asking the same question?

189
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,546
If I am so boring,
then you should leave me.

190
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:21,921
Sorry.

191
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,255
I really am.

192
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:27,671
I'm not saying you're boring.

193
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:30,213
It's just this habit of yours.

194
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:35,671
What are you doing in front of people?

195
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:37,838
Are they your relatives?

196
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:40,588
What can they do anyway?

197
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,046
There is something called
public decency, mister.

198
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,088
See the videos in the secret folders
on people's phones.

199
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,213
You'll see how decent they are.

200
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:55,796
That reminds me,
let's shoot it on the phone today.

201
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,380
What did I tell you last time?

202
00:14:58,921 --> 00:14:59,880
You said no.

203
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:01,755
And why did I say no?

204
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:05,296
What if the phone gets stolen,
lost or hacked?

205
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,713
Yes. So, what has changed since then?

206
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,171
Nothing.

207
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:12,463
You still don't trust me.

208
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,463
Where does trust come into this?

209
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,463
Exactly, there is no trust.

210
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:22,380
You always find ways to twist my words.

211
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,630
You're too smart, eh?

212
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:28,630
Knowing you'd lose the argument,
you just changed the topic.

213
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,838
Losing, winning...

214
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,296
Love isn't a contest!

215
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,421
-Is it not?
-No.

216
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:41,421
Are you so dumb?

217
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,296
Wait a sec.

218
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:44,755
I just called you smart,

219
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:47,505
but now I'm wondering
if you're a smartass or a dumb fuck.

220
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,088
Don't abuse me.

221
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:53,546
You love me but you can't handle
my cussing? Is your love that sanitized?

222
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,338
Now who's changing the topic?

223
00:15:57,963 --> 00:16:00,505
Why do you treat love like a contest?

224
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:02,380
Just me?

225
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,338
Everyone treats it that way.

226
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:07,880
There's no equality in love.

227
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:15,088
One partner always dominates the other.

228
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:19,796
Sometimes blatantly,
sometimes by emotional manipulation.

229
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:22,963
And the best part is, no one learns this.

230
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:26,005
It just happens. Automatically.

231
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:32,255
Those romantic songs, films, books...

232
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,421
Inspirational videos on
WhatsApp and Facebook...

233
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:40,046
Telling us how nice love is,
or how cute life is...

234
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,588
They just want to hide one truth.

235
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,671
What truth?

236
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,213
That all love is selfish. People
love only if there's something to gain.

237
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:52,505
Without profit, love can't exist.
And if it does, it doesn't last.

238
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,005
Profit?

239
00:16:57,338 --> 00:17:02,505
Yeah, like the joy of small
emotional victories over the other.

240
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:07,296
So you think I love
you for selfish reasons?

241
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:09,713
Aren't you human?

242
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,880
What do I have to gain, tell me?

243
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:16,796
Half the time you're crying,
or else you fight.

244
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:20,630
Maybe you enjoy suffering like Sunita.

245
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:22,796
Maybe that's how you profit from love.

246
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:27,963
The day you stop enjoying
being sad with me, you'd leave me.

247
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,963
Just how a stockbroker
leaves the share market.

248
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:40,630
This accounting job of yours has made
you see everything as profit and loss!

249
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:43,546
And you're Mother Teresa's heir, right?

250
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,838
I don't think we'll get a taxi.
Let's take the train.

251
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:48,755
Cool.

252
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:52,421
Nah. We take the train every day.

253
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,630
Today we'll take a cab or walk.

254
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:56,671
Okay.

255
00:17:58,296 --> 00:17:59,130
Listen.

256
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:00,171
Yeah.

257
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:04,838
Chuck it.

258
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:08,796
Say!

259
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,755
Nah. Nothing.

260
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,755
Of course there's something.

261
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,046
Tell me. Don't build it up.

262
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:16,796
I'll tell you later.

263
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,213
Why not now?

264
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,880
Can't we talk about this later at leisure?

265
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:26,255
In any case,
you'll be calmer after you eat.

266
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:31,921
See, that's accounting, got it?

267
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:34,380
First, you evaluated my state of mind...

268
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:37,463
And calculated that emotional
investment can be made later.

269
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:39,296
Better chances of returns!

270
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,671
Thank you my dear, for proving my point.

271
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,296
That's... that's not what I had meant...

272
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,630
The taxi's here.

273
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,005
So, what do I do now?

274
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,796
You are already late in filing it.

275
00:18:55,546 --> 00:18:58,130
Can't you forge a simple balance sheet?

276
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,338
Why the fuck did you all become CA,
you dumb fucks!

277
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:03,338
Sort out your mess, and don't bother me.
Hang up now!

278
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:20,921
What's this boring song, bro!
Change the channel or turn it off.

279
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:25,630
It's not playing for you,
mister - it's for me.

280
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:28,046
But the customer has a problem with it.

281
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:32,588
So what do I do?
Am I a doctor, to fix your problems?

282
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,130
The customer is God. Never heard of it?

283
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:43,421
Then use your Godly powers- stop the
music and make my cab run without petrol!

284
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,005
I like this guy.
Too bad, he'll never go far in life!

285
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:56,630
Bro, focus on your girlfriend. What I do
with my life is up to me. Got it?

286
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:58,546
What's your name, buddy?

287
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:02,713
Joginder. Want to dial
customer care and complain?

288
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:05,588
No. In fact, you're worthy of praise.

289
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,338
And why would you praise me?

290
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:13,130
In this world of ass-lickers,
there aren't many like you left.

291
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:19,338
I'm like you too.
Our honesty won't get us far in life.

292
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,130
It's not like that, brother.
I was almost set for life.

293
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,171
I voted for the BJP.

294
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,880
Actually, I voted for Narendra Modi.
For 'Development'.

295
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:38,046
I had hoped inflation would decrease.

296
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,755
Petrol prices would drop.

297
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:44,713
Food would get cheaper.
I'd save and buy my own cab.

298
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:48,880
I own a piece of land in the village.
Had planned to set up my own flour mill.

299
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:50,546
Nothing happened.

300
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,005
The promise of development
turned out to be a farce. Nothing more.

301
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:55,713
Then vote for the Congress party?

302
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,713
What on earth are you saying?

303
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:01,130
Voting for the Congress means
voting for that Gandhi boy.

304
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:04,671
He's still in his mother's lap...
how can he manage the country?

305
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:07,213
Then what about Kejriwal?

306
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:12,338
Kejriwal is an idiot.
He can barely handle Delhi,

307
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:15,046
you think he can manage the country?

308
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,255
Then go for the Leftists.

309
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:22,296
Those with red flags are left
with red asses now. They can't do shit.

310
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,505
Then who will you vote for?

311
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:31,171
I won't vote for anyone now.
I have lost faith.

312
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:38,046
Speaking of which, who would you vote for?
Which party do you support?

313
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:42,921
I don't even believe in marriage.

314
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,796
What does that even mean?

315
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:51,796
I didn't get you.

316
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:56,671
Every five years, the country is
married to a government. After five years,

317
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,671
If it works,
great - else there's a divorce

318
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:02,796
Till then, we are bound to be sodomized.

319
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:09,130
No matter, who wins the election,
it's the public that always loses.

320
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,005
That's true.

321
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:15,463
Are you dating him or me?

322
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:18,671
What happened?

323
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,421
Talk to me.
I don't get politics.

324
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,338
I know that.

325
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,671
You've never even voted, right?

326
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:31,713
What's the point of voting?
Didn't you hear what he said?

327
00:22:31,796 --> 00:22:35,880
True madam. Voting changes nothing.
We make our own lives.

328
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:37,088
Got it?

329
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:41,130
A stranger who sees not
just your thoughts before me,

330
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,255
But also your feelings!

331
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,796
You guys think so alike. Bro,

332
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:49,630
you sit here at the back. I'll drive.

333
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,588
You just can't control your tongue.

334
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,588
That can't happen, Sir.
I have my wife back in the village.

335
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:56,796
We have a little daughter too.

336
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:00,421
That's nice! Do you visit them often?

337
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,963
No Madam.
No point in visiting the village.

338
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:09,213
When she's free, I send her tickets
and she comes here for 3-4 months.

339
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,838
There is nothing but
heat and dust back there.

340
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:16,380
How can you say that?
There's so much peace in villages.

341
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:18,921
It's the cities that
are the hotbed of stress.

342
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:21,546
Madam, looks like you're city-born.

343
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:24,588
Yes. How did you know?

344
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:27,296
Because it's too obvious!

345
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:32,463
This romantic idea of yours...
That the village is idyllic, peaceful...

346
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:36,130
He figured you've never
been to a real village.

347
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:38,921
What's romantic about what I said?

348
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:42,213
Farmers are dying. There's no water.

349
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,463
Forget serious illnesses,

350
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:48,130
there's no doctor to treat fever
for miles around in most villages.

351
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:51,963
And even if you find one, you can't be
sure if he's not a fake. Wanna hear more?

352
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:55,213
No. Why should I? Are you a journalist?

353
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:58,421
If only they did their
jobs with integrity.

354
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:01,671
You can only complain.

355
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:06,713
Then go! Leave your measly job
and move to a village.

356
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:11,796
I can.

357
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,171
It's not like villages haven't progressed.

358
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:22,963
So much has changed.
There's internet, TV, mobile phones.

359
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:31,338
So the things that cause stress in the
city, you want them in a village as well!

360
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:34,838
You ought to be worshipped.

361
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:40,630
You're a saint. You deserve to live there.

362
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:45,338
Why should I go,

363
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Why should I go, without you by my side?

364
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:03,005
Because you'd be hot
property in a village,

365
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,796
many boys will fall for you.

366
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:14,671
In a city, no matter how much
make-up you put, you'll look like trash.

367
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:19,005
Go to hell.

368
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:25,005
You think you look like a stud?
Look at a mirror once!

369
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,796
Whatever. I am the hero of my own film.

370
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,255
A flop film.

371
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,338
As if yours is a blockbuster.

372
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:35,880
Please stop the car. At the corner ahead.

373
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:40,338
Can't stop it here Ma'am.
Just a bit ahead.

374
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:42,088
Are you pissed?

375
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:44,296
Are you?

376
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,088
Yes. So what?

377
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:03,463
Watch ahead! Driving like a buffoon.

378
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:29,005
She gets charged up when she's angry.
Like a wild cat.

379
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:32,005
So the dog in me is
bound to get excited, right?

380
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,171
Take it easy, man!

381
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:47,296
He won't stop till he cuts it down

382
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,380
It's not a big deal, Sir.

383
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:02,505
What you did.

384
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:06,171
You didn't have a problem?

385
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:07,921
No sir. Not at all.

386
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:12,963
We did the same thing
in a taxi the last time as well.

387
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:16,546
The driver got very angry.
Said we had polluted his car.

388
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:23,171
He was an old grouch.

389
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:29,380
Lectured us on how today's
vile youth are fucking up the country.

390
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:36,588
These old farts are just jealous. They
keep shoving their wisdom up our asses.

391
00:28:36,921 --> 00:28:39,255
Cowards, all of them.

392
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:42,838
Even my father was like that.

393
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:45,171
And his father too.

394
00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:50,005
But what you did Sir, it's not a big deal.

395
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,963
Let me tell you a secret.

396
00:28:53,921 --> 00:29:03,338
When I stop driving after 11 at night,
I rent the taxi out to gay couples.

397
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:07,880
They have their fun
and we earn some money.

398
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,338
Is it good money?

399
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,838
What good money?
Have to share it with the cops as well.

400
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,338
The police know about this?

401
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:23,213
This is Mumbai. Nothing happens
here without police permission.

402
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:29,130
And these days, even the self-appointed
moral police have joined in.

403
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:32,130
Motherfuckers.
They'd probably fuck you up.

404
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:36,838
They would?
They already have fucked us up, Sir.

405
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:41,296
Let me tell you something.
Come here...

406
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:48,296
I have a friend who also
drives a cab in Versova.

407
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,213
Right.

408
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:56,880
Last week, in Versova,
he gave his taxi to two girls.

409
00:29:56,963 --> 00:30:05,296
And the moral policing goons
turned up all armed.

410
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,880
He asked them to take some money
and let them go.

411
00:30:07,963 --> 00:30:09,380
But they were in no mood to listen.

412
00:30:09,463 --> 00:30:11,421
This guy seems to be in a rush.

413
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:15,005
Put a siren on the car and buzz off!

414
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:21,921
So the goons beat him up,
pulled the girls out....raped them,

415
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:25,005
made a video and then
put it on a porn site.

416
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,380
They didn't know that one of
the girls was a rich man's daughter.

417
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,963
She left a note and committed suicide.

418
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:35,213
The next day, the police
and the cultural goons were caught...

419
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:38,838
And our special night
service was shut down.

420
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,921
Good only.

421
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:44,755
I can't believe your story.

422
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:50,880
If that girl was a rich kid, then
she could've gone to a five star hotel!

423
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,630
Why would she pick up
your special taxi service?

424
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:58,338
Madam, the thing is...
Let it go. Sir will mind.

425
00:30:58,463 --> 00:30:59,880
No, go on.

426
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,005
Why would I mind,
it's not like we're married.

427
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:12,463
Ma'am, these rich people
have a poverty fetish.

428
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:18,130
Just like...
That Salman Khan film- what was it called?

429
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:19,088
Bajrangi.

430
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,838
Such a shitty film.
Not that one. There was another.

431
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,088
Sultan?

432
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:25,838
That was even shittier. The recent one...

433
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:28,255
Yes, 'Kick'! They get a kick out of it.

434
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:31,421
Rich people get a kick out of
getting down and dirty.

435
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,505
Now what happened?

436
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:44,130
What do you mean,
'not that we're married'?

437
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:48,421
Since we're not married... What
would you do if a man tried molesting me?

438
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:53,088
Haven't thought about it.
We'll see when it happens.

439
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:56,338
No. tell me now. What would
you do if a man tried molesting me?

440
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:57,796
What would I do?

441
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,421
Thrash him, what else?

442
00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:06,755
Thank God.

443
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,380
I thought you didn't love me.

444
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:14,963
How is that related to love?

445
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:21,796
Not just you, I'd do it for any girl.

446
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:24,880
So it's not about loving me...

447
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:29,005
Only because that you think it's wrong?

448
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:32,755
There is nothing wrong or right.

449
00:32:34,546 --> 00:32:35,880
People can digest certain things or not.

450
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:38,213
What one can digest one does.
What one can't, one doesn't.

451
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:40,713
Be it food, drinks, crime or corruption.

452
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:45,296
Forget this discourse on digestion.
The point is, do you love me or not?

453
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:49,546
Well, as Shah Rukh said in Mohabbatein...

454
00:32:50,255 --> 00:32:54,505
Don't love someone
expecting to be loved back.

455
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:00,171
Unrequited love- the same
thing was in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.

456
00:33:00,421 --> 00:33:03,463
You even cried during the film. Then
why are you contradicting yourself now?

457
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:06,588
So that means you don't love me.

458
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,588
You believe what you want.

459
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:12,421
You know I can't stand
this lovey-dovey talk.

460
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:17,671
If you irritate me more,
I'll leave you here and go. Should I?

461
00:33:33,588 --> 00:33:35,463
We've reached CafÃ© Gulshan.

462
00:33:38,838 --> 00:33:39,713
How much?

463
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,338
70 rupees. Do give change.

464
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:45,963
Wait a sec. Let me park by the side.

465
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:53,838
Do you have change?

466
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,838
If you ask for your phone, I'll leave now.

467
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:29,796
My WhatsApp just started working.
Just 2 minutes, please?

468
00:34:30,046 --> 00:34:31,838
Mom had gone to a cousin's wedding.

469
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:34,380
You won't believe the ruckus
that happened there.

470
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,046
Please give it back?

471
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:40,671
She's telling me what happened to the
groom's family after the police arrived!

472
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:41,921
Please, love?

473
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:45,421
Get the bill.

474
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:47,546
No, No! Wait, wait!

475
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,963
Sorry. I'll talk to mom later.

476
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:00,296
Why do you get mad so quick?

477
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:05,630
First say what you were
waiting to tell me here.

478
00:35:47,338 --> 00:35:48,588
What do I do with this?

479
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:49,838
It's a present.

480
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:52,130
For what joy?

481
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:55,296
It's our first anniversary, dumbo!

482
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,255
So?

483
00:35:58,546 --> 00:36:01,296
So? Isn't it a happy occasion?

484
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,880
It'll be two years the next year.

485
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:07,921
Will you give me a bike then?

486
00:36:08,588 --> 00:36:10,838
And a car after three years?

487
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:13,963
I'll gift you a child after marriage.

488
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,380
So that's what you wanted to say.

489
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,213
Why pretend with this gift?

490
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,921
You aren't pretending to love me, right?

491
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:29,630
Tell me, will you marry me?

492
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:33,171
No idea. What's the hurry?

493
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,421
Hurry?

494
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:41,671
I'm 30, love.

495
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:47,046
Need to have a child in 2 years.

496
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:50,755
Mom pesters me a lot these days.

497
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:54,796
Should we get married to pacify
your mom or to legally have a child?

498
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,005
Decide this first.

499
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:00,255
That's not what I meant.

500
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:05,755
But don't tell me you've
never thought of marriage .

501
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:10,296
I have. Absolutely.

502
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,005
In fact, I had decided
before we started dating.

503
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:17,088
Well?

504
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:22,880
Like always,
I decided to take it as it comes.

505
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:28,671
So when will you be sure about me?
I mean, about us?

506
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:31,838
How am I supposed to know?

507
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,546
Don't say that, love.

508
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:43,380
I feel very insecure thinking
that you'll leave me for another girl.

509
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,463
That's also possible.

510
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:49,963
Just like you may leave me
for another man...

511
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:52,463
One who's ready to
marry you right away.

512
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:54,421
I will never leave you.

513
00:37:54,588 --> 00:37:56,546
I haven't left you yet either.

514
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:58,880
Then what's the hurry to get married?

515
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,671
Am I wrong to think this?

516
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:08,088
Not wrong. Just childish.

517
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:16,171
Suppose we get married tomorrow.

518
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:23,630
What's the guarantee that I won't
fall for another woman after marriage?

519
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:27,338
And then divorce you and settle with her?

520
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:32,255
Anyway, a woman doesn't
remain the same after childbirth.

521
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:34,588
The body begins to wear out.

522
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,088
Where will you roam around with a kid?

523
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:41,630
You won't do that.

524
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:42,838
Why?

525
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:49,046
Because no matter what you say,
you're honest at heart.

526
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,713
You aren't deceitful. I know that.

527
00:38:56,755 --> 00:38:57,671
So?

528
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,005
Honest people never deceive others.

529
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:05,088
How is that relevant?

530
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,213
For example,
like I find you exciting today...

531
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:15,296
I may find another
woman exciting tomorrow.

532
00:39:16,546 --> 00:39:17,755
I won't cheat on you.

533
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,255
I'll tell you frankly that
I have fallen for someone else.

534
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:24,005
If that woman likes me back,
then I'll leave you.

535
00:39:24,213 --> 00:39:25,713
Now, how is that cheating?

536
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:30,255
No. You won't do anything like this.

537
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,088
Marriage changes people.

538
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:38,755
The ones who change are scared of society.

539
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,338
I don't give a fuck about society
when it comes to my personal life

540
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:50,213
Sure, I might change a bit, for a year
or two, to try out this routine dull life.

541
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,296
But you'd get bored
of me once that happens

542
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:58,130
I will never get bored of you.

543
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:00,588
Because I am like this, right?

544
00:40:03,713 --> 00:40:07,005
I will become like
the rest after marriage.

545
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:10,630
Then you will miss my pre-marriage avatar.

546
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:13,838
You will get bored for sure.

547
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:14,963
No.

548
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,421
All these made-in-heaven
celebrity couples,

549
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:18,005
even they must be bored of each other.

550
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:27,005
So couples who stay together till death,
do so pointlessly?

551
00:40:28,296 --> 00:40:30,963
Even a farmer stays with his fields,
all till he dies...

552
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,630
Even if he goes bankrupt,
if he hasn't committed suicide already.

553
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,796
Because he doesn't have an option.

554
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,213
And if he does, then he doesn't
have the balls to act on it.

555
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:50,421
I agree marriages have issues.
They all do, love.

556
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:55,546
But after a certain age, it matters
to have someone waiting for you at home.

557
00:40:57,671 --> 00:40:58,671
Of course it matters.

558
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:05,338
But only for people like you who
can't live without depending on others.

559
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,755
I am a modern independent woman.

560
00:41:15,296 --> 00:41:18,171
Financially, yes.

561
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:21,296
But not at heart,

562
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:25,296
and definitely not at mind.

563
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:29,755
Only because I want to get married?

564
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:34,921
You talk about taking risks...

565
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,838
Why not take the risk of marrying me?

566
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:41,046
Come here! Listen.

567
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:44,380
What is a risk?

568
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:51,880
A risk is where there is no security.

569
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:55,588
And marriage literally means security.

570
00:41:57,255 --> 00:41:59,838
So how is marriage a risk?

571
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,796
It's always the same issues,

572
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:06,713
clashes over money and ego.

573
00:42:07,213 --> 00:42:11,296
The same futile fights
like the ones in films and TV.

574
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:14,421
Families will interfere.

575
00:42:15,421 --> 00:42:18,005
Raising kids will keep you entertained,

576
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:19,588
but what about me?

577
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:24,671
I'll end up philandering, and
even our sex-life will become mechanical.

578
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:31,671
If you find some fresh sausage,
even you'll salivate.

579
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,921
Whether one is honest or not,

580
00:42:39,296 --> 00:42:41,296
either way tensions are bound to rise.

581
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:43,380
Then fights. Divorce.

582
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:46,213
A phone barely lasts two years...

583
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:48,713
And you dream of lifelong companionship?

584
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:59,421
Our parents' marriages lasted, right?

585
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:02,880
Of course.

586
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:05,880
But that time was different.

587
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:09,796
And even they probably had their affairs.

588
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:17,421
Who knows where our fathers' dicks went,
and for whom our mothers' cunts opened up?

589
00:43:17,755 --> 00:43:20,421
Those were different times.
Times of hiding things.

590
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:25,338
Times of token respect for parents,
family and the nation.

591
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,130
And if our parents were
so righteous and wise...

592
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:34,088
Then why are we so fucked today?

593
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:37,338
Because they were hollow.

594
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:43,463
If our parents were truly cultured
and sensible...

595
00:43:43,546 --> 00:43:46,213
We wouldn't have been like this.

596
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,338
Sweetheart,

597
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:53,546
you want adventure and security...

598
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:56,088
Romance and reality - all at once.

599
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:59,755
You can revel in hypocrisy, not me.

600
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:11,546
Fine, I won't get anything for you.

601
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,421
I've understood.

602
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:15,713
You're just killing time with me.

603
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:17,671
Not serious at all.

604
00:44:18,296 --> 00:44:19,713
What's the point of getting serious?

605
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:20,796
Tell me.

606
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:25,255
We live a maximum of 60 years...

607
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:32,046
First 20 studying and
the last 15 in regrets.

608
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:33,880
That leaves only 25 years in hand.

609
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:39,171
8 years go in completing
8 hours of daily sleep.

610
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:40,838
That leaves 17 years.

611
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:45,130
2 years go in eating and shitting.

612
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:51,213
So, in the remaining 15 years,
enjoy as much as you can.

613
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:58,213
Change as many jobs, partners,
principles, castes, religions

614
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:01,005
and countries as you can.

615
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:03,505
Why tie yourself to one thing?

616
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:08,546
That's easy for you to say.

617
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:11,005
You're a man.

618
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:12,338
So?

619
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:17,296
We're born men or women by accident.

620
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,588
Women can also do all this, can't they?

621
00:45:23,505 --> 00:45:25,296
If you just want a child,
there are many ways to have one.

622
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:26,671
Read up on the internet.

623
00:45:26,921 --> 00:45:28,671
Why do you need marriage for that?

624
00:45:29,963 --> 00:45:32,463
All this sounds great,

625
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:36,380
but tomorrow if your wife elopes
with someone else, you'd feel like shit!

626
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,588
Look silly.

627
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:43,921
I've already told you,
nothing is good or bad.

628
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:48,588
It's all about how
much someone can stomach.

629
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:52,963
I can digest all this.
You can't. That's the difference.

630
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:59,338
If I'm not trying to change your mindset,
then why are you imposing yours on me?

631
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,505
At first I thought you were joking.

632
00:46:19,796 --> 00:46:25,088
But forget marriage,
I doubt you even love me.

633
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:44,213
I do love you.

634
00:46:44,546 --> 00:46:50,505
Which is why I am here. Now. Today. This
moment. I've been with you for a year.

635
00:46:51,463 --> 00:46:53,505
But I can't speak for tomorrow.

636
00:46:54,505 --> 00:46:57,338
And I won't make the mistake
of marrying - you or anyone else.

637
00:46:58,088 --> 00:46:59,421
What if you do?

638
00:46:59,755 --> 00:47:02,838
So what? You just said I'm not serious.

639
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:07,338
I may end up marrying
you or someone at a whim.

640
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:09,588
If I get bored, I might get a divorce.

641
00:47:11,046 --> 00:47:14,588
Life is a comedy,
if you can catch the joke.

642
00:47:26,796 --> 00:47:30,255
I'll leave after eating.
I'm breaking up with you.

643
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,838
Full and final. I'm done with you.

644
00:47:35,463 --> 00:47:37,921
You know I can't stand
chit-chat while eating.

645
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:41,046
Especially when it's such nice food, after

646
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,505
I am not chatting.
I'm telling you. We're done.

647
00:47:53,421 --> 00:47:54,588
So tell me,

648
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:58,005
what will you do after the break-up?

649
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:00,713
Who's chatting now?

650
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:02,380
It's my rule.

651
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:06,046
I'll break it when I want.
What do you care?

652
00:48:10,296 --> 00:48:13,796
You're hurt, aren't you?

653
00:48:15,338 --> 00:48:16,921
Now you realize how I feel when you...

654
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:18,296
I am hurt.

655
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,713
But don't you worry.

656
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:25,671
Like my backache gets fine after a week,

657
00:48:26,296 --> 00:48:27,630
so will my heartache.

658
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:34,838
After a point, I can't take all this.

659
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:43,630
I'll send you an invite.

660
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:53,671
You'll get married after we break up?

661
00:48:54,338 --> 00:48:55,213
Yes.

662
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:02,046
With whom?

663
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:05,463
With whoever. What do you care?

664
00:49:06,796 --> 00:49:10,963
I've spent so much time with you,
don't I deserve to know?

665
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:17,755
I'll find someone from
a matrimonial website.

666
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:25,213
Else, all the guys I've been
rejecting for an asshole like you,

667
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,380
I'll marry one of them.

668
00:49:29,463 --> 00:49:31,046
Go ahead.

669
00:49:32,213 --> 00:49:33,755
You'll find some loser.

670
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:36,546
There are loads in this country.

671
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:38,880
You are a loser. My husband won't be.

672
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:40,921
Hundred percent he will be one.

673
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:43,921
How do you know? Did you conceive him?

674
00:49:46,088 --> 00:49:47,088
I know it.

675
00:49:57,213 --> 00:49:58,838
Because you are a loser.

676
00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:03,588
Neither are you pretty,
nor do you have a hot body.

677
00:50:03,713 --> 00:50:05,713
You don't have money
nor an illustrious family.

678
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:11,380
You aren't funny or interesting.

679
00:50:13,338 --> 00:50:16,338
You're 30, but you look 35.

680
00:50:17,671 --> 00:50:22,046
That famous line from the movie Krantiveer
describes your life perfectly-

681
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:25,255
"I don't know what I lived or died for!"

682
00:50:26,921 --> 00:50:28,296
Did you get it?

683
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:08,838
And what are you?

684
00:51:09,963 --> 00:51:11,463
A king?

685
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:15,713
You still stay in a rented
place with two other guys.

686
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,296
You have brains but zero success.

687
00:51:19,463 --> 00:51:22,296
No girl has survived you beyond a month,

688
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,671
except me.

689
00:51:25,338 --> 00:51:28,088
Your family doesn't even want to see you.

690
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:30,755
You'll die like a lonely prick.

691
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,838
Even those who come to your
funeral shall spit on your grave.

692
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,630
Exactly. Perfect analysis.

693
00:51:37,796 --> 00:51:40,005
That's why we're made for each other.

694
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:45,880
Break up if you want, but you
won't find another like me. You'll see.

695
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:55,421
You...

696
00:51:56,255 --> 00:51:57,630
you are depressed.

697
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,921
I don't want to be depressed with you.

698
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:05,213
Depressed...

699
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:06,130
Me?

700
00:52:06,463 --> 00:52:07,588
Aren't you?

701
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:12,046
The government is rotten. The media
is a sellout. Your parents are idiots.

702
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,921
Friends are selfish.

703
00:52:16,463 --> 00:52:19,463
The guys you work with
are either corrupt or cowards.

704
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:22,005
Films are boring and
your girlfriend is a loser.

705
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,671
If you have problems with everything,

706
00:52:24,838 --> 00:52:26,838
why don't you just kill yourself?

707
00:52:27,588 --> 00:52:28,421
What?

708
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:30,463
Suicide. Do it.

709
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:41,130
Sweetheart, depressed are
those whose hopes have been fucked.

710
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:43,421
I have no hope,

711
00:52:44,588 --> 00:52:46,130
and hence, no disappointments.

712
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:51,088
No fear. That's why I have freedom.

713
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:54,588
And why should I commit suicide?

714
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,005
I love life.

715
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:03,963
The world and its people are crooked,
but I love fighting them.

716
00:53:05,463 --> 00:53:08,130
Actually, you are jealous of my freedom.

717
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:11,046
You want to be like me, but you can't.

718
00:53:11,296 --> 00:53:14,963
Isn't that why you want
to trap me with marriage and children?

719
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:18,505
So that I also become spineless like you!

720
00:53:19,755 --> 00:53:21,130
So after marriage,

721
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,505
you can fuck my mind
the way I fuck yours now?

722
00:53:23,588 --> 00:53:25,130
Let me eat in peace.

723
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:46,421
Stop it! Let me watch the movie.

724
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:50,213
You need your eyes and ears for that.

725
00:53:50,755 --> 00:53:53,005
Leave the rest for me to fuck.

726
00:53:56,921 --> 00:53:59,005
You said the same thing last time.

727
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:06,755
Shake it. Rub it. Suck it. Ride it.

728
00:54:07,338 --> 00:54:09,671
I know all your tricks.

729
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,796
I won't allow anything.
Let me watch the movie.

730
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:20,255
What crap!
How can you watch this stupid movie.

731
00:54:20,338 --> 00:54:23,421
What stupid? It's a nice movie.

732
00:54:24,796 --> 00:54:27,421
Such movies educate the public.

733
00:54:27,755 --> 00:54:34,630
On how to respect the country and women.

734
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:39,296
You especially must watch it.

735
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,130
If 5000 years of culture
couldn't educate the public,

736
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,421
what difference will
this 2 hour movie make?

737
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,880
I'm not that educated,

738
00:55:17,963 --> 00:55:24,463
but I know people must be reminded
constantly about what's good and bad.

739
00:55:25,421 --> 00:55:29,838
Else wouldn't it be easier
for powerful assholes to mislead them?

740
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:31,338
Wow.

741
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:37,213
You are getting smarter.

742
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:40,380
Are you praising me or...

743
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,755
Only the innocent get misled.

744
00:55:44,046 --> 00:55:46,713
And people today are far from innocent.

745
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:52,171
They were at one time, but not anymore.

746
00:55:55,213 --> 00:55:59,338
You think people don't
know what's good or bad?

747
00:56:00,546 --> 00:56:02,421
Everyone knows everything.

748
00:56:03,171 --> 00:56:07,380
They don't need education for that.
They just know.

749
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:12,046
Yet they vote for scum,
this innocent public of yours.

750
00:56:14,796 --> 00:56:16,171
They take dowry.

751
00:56:18,546 --> 00:56:21,213
Abort girl children.

752
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:27,171
Either they commit corruption
or comply silently.

753
00:56:28,963 --> 00:56:35,171
So long as their own house is not on fire,
they let others' burn.

754
00:56:38,005 --> 00:56:40,005
Arguing over which party to side with,

755
00:56:40,796 --> 00:56:43,463
this stupid public has
forgotten to take its own side.

756
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:57,380
I often wonder what the
soldiers on the border think.

757
00:57:00,421 --> 00:57:02,588
We sleep peacefully because of them.

758
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,130
Can they sleep peacefully
knowing what's happening

759
00:57:06,213 --> 00:57:07,380
in the country they're protecting?

760
00:57:16,755 --> 00:57:18,755
You used to write poems in college, right?

761
00:57:19,171 --> 00:57:20,671
Did plays as well?

762
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:26,880
There's still time, you should quit
accounting and write dialogues for movies.

763
00:57:27,213 --> 00:57:28,421
Dialogues for movies?

764
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:31,713
Yes! Your mind will find an outlet.

765
00:57:37,505 --> 00:57:39,463
Our cinema is as spineless as our people.

766
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:45,838
Have you ever heard the name
of any political party in a movie?

767
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:56,921
The characters inhabit a space where
nothing is real-whether it's politics,

768
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,713
sex or society.

769
00:58:00,755 --> 00:58:02,255
It's all superficial.

770
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:15,671
Home-made sex videos
are more authentic than this.

771
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:23,046
These cowards have got the
audience addicted to this delusion.

772
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:29,338
It's like opium, both the
peddlers and buyers are in a stupor.

773
00:58:32,463 --> 00:58:34,505
Why don't you write for art films instead?

774
00:58:37,463 --> 00:58:38,505
Look at me.

775
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:42,213
Have you ever seen an art film?

776
00:58:42,296 --> 00:58:43,421
Yes, I have.

777
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:46,171
They are all art.

778
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:49,130
But no heart.

779
00:58:50,963 --> 00:58:52,255
Social sensitivity...

780
00:58:55,088 --> 00:58:56,755
Tailor-made for white-collar people.

781
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:00,255
Well-ironed.

782
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:09,046
These popcorn flicks we watch
waste enough of my hard-earned money.

783
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:15,713
Even if I write something,
the Censors won't pass it.

784
00:59:16,463 --> 00:59:18,005
And if it does pass,

785
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:24,380
it'll offend so many
people that it would flop.

786
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:33,338
Yes. I read about the movie 'Padmaavat'.

787
00:59:34,046 --> 00:59:37,671
Mom says intolerance has
increased under the BJP government.

788
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,796
It's probably best you don't write movies.

789
00:59:41,171 --> 00:59:45,338
You'll write about Modi or the BJP.

790
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:49,755
Or the RSS.

791
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:54,630
You're better being an accountant.

792
00:59:55,421 --> 00:59:59,421
The current climate is dangerous
for freedom of expression.

793
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:02,838
The current climate?

794
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:14,630
Things have never been ideal
nor will they be in a 100 years.

795
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:23,463
The Congress blames the BJP and
RSS for curbing Freedom of Expression.

796
01:00:24,213 --> 01:00:29,296
Will the Congress tolerate movies

797
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:34,713
or serials criticizing
the Nehru-Gandhi family?

798
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:36,796
Do they have guts?

799
01:00:39,046 --> 01:00:41,463
Everyone wants to censor.

800
01:00:42,046 --> 01:00:46,130
Politicians,
news media, industrialists, the judiciary.

801
01:00:47,005 --> 01:00:50,713
Whoever comes to power will do this.

802
01:00:53,213 --> 01:00:54,130
Enough.

803
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:56,755
Let me enjoy the movie.

804
01:00:56,921 --> 01:00:58,796
You enjoy the movie,

805
01:00:59,171 --> 01:01:02,005
let me enjoy you. What's the problem!

806
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:05,130
Look, the song has started.
Suck me off till then please.

807
01:01:05,255 --> 01:01:06,546
I'll tell you when the song is over.

808
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,338
You can watch it on YouTube later.

809
01:01:09,255 --> 01:01:11,255
I can see the whole movie on the internet.

810
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,671
I want to watch it here!

811
01:01:30,296 --> 01:01:32,088
Will you suck or should I leave?

812
01:01:33,755 --> 01:01:35,213
Then you can watch it in peace.

813
01:01:39,213 --> 01:01:41,213
Your cunt creamed in the cab.

814
01:01:41,921 --> 01:01:43,255
What about me?

815
01:01:44,046 --> 01:01:45,921
My dick is still waiting.

816
01:01:47,463 --> 01:01:51,838
Should I wait till eternity now? You won't
let me watch the movie in peace, right?

817
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:53,796
I will. Why wouldn't I?

818
01:01:54,338 --> 01:01:56,338
But pacify my cock first.

819
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,421
Yeah, start now.

820
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:39,213
How long will we go on like this?

821
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:42,213
Like what?

822
01:02:44,421 --> 01:02:45,671
The way things are.

823
01:02:46,546 --> 01:02:48,796
Now don't bore me with
the same things again.

824
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:53,213
Then what do I talk to you about?

825
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,755
Either you fight

826
01:02:58,213 --> 01:02:59,088
or have sex

827
01:02:59,671 --> 01:03:02,255
or give depressing sermons.

828
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:06,380
Would it hurt to talk lovingly for once...

829
01:03:06,505 --> 01:03:08,671
This is how I love, silly.

830
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:10,171
You won't get it.

831
01:03:15,963 --> 01:03:17,213
I get it.

832
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,130
You're a coward.

833
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:25,713
You run away before you
can get hurt by anything.

834
01:03:26,838 --> 01:03:28,171
Look at me.

835
01:03:28,796 --> 01:03:30,505
Despite all my hardships,

836
01:03:30,755 --> 01:03:33,588
I still have the courage to face more.

837
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:38,921
You are envious of my courage, right?

838
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:42,338
Both envious and attracted.

839
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:50,046
You won't be able to handle
a girl like yourself, right?

840
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:31,463
You are right.

841
01:04:34,296 --> 01:04:35,671
We should break up.

842
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:41,255
What's this all of a sudden?

843
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,421
It's not sudden. It's how it is.

844
01:04:45,546 --> 01:04:49,546
What's simmering in our
subconscious suddenly hits us.

845
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:51,463
Didn't you also want
to break up back at the hotel?

846
01:04:51,963 --> 01:04:54,963
I've spoken of it many times.
But so have you.

847
01:04:55,046 --> 01:04:56,005
I know.

848
01:04:58,505 --> 01:04:59,505
But it never hit me.

849
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:03,546
I don't know about you,
but it didn't hit me.

850
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:09,630
When you were talking at the hotel,
I heard you but didn't absorb your words.

851
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:11,838
Now I have.

852
01:05:19,713 --> 01:05:20,838
Let's break up.

853
01:05:22,088 --> 01:05:25,588
This will probably
be the first amicable one.

854
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:30,046
Let it go, love.

855
01:05:30,505 --> 01:05:32,171
I never meant it.

856
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:36,796
I know you're very stressed these days.

857
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,296
That's my default mode.

858
01:05:40,338 --> 01:05:41,838
I get high on stress.

859
01:05:43,546 --> 01:05:49,296
Even if I land in heaven, I will fuck
things up to create stress for everyone.

860
01:05:51,005 --> 01:05:53,380
But that's not the point. My point is that

861
01:05:54,213 --> 01:05:57,421
our relationship has
reached its expiry date.

862
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:02,338
One should throw away an expired
product before it fucks you up.

863
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:06,088
What product?

864
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:13,921
Come. Get up.
Drop me till the hostel.

865
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,130
Let's drop the subject.

866
01:06:18,796 --> 01:06:20,921
I don't want to justify breaking up.

867
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,755
It must be done.

868
01:06:23,088 --> 01:06:24,088
That's it!

869
01:06:29,713 --> 01:06:30,880
Anyway...

870
01:06:34,463 --> 01:06:35,671
There's this girl at the bank.

871
01:06:41,671 --> 01:06:42,838
What did you say?

872
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:54,546
The bank near my house.

873
01:06:57,005 --> 01:06:58,130
There is a girl there.

874
01:06:58,880 --> 01:06:59,880
Cashier.

875
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,296
She's average-looking.

876
01:07:03,713 --> 01:07:04,963
Doesn't talk much.

877
01:07:05,713 --> 01:07:06,796
Quite innocent.

878
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:10,463
But her eyes ooze with lust,

879
01:07:11,963 --> 01:07:14,463
even if she tries to hide it.

880
01:07:16,588 --> 01:07:19,505
Plus, she has round and tight breasts.

881
01:07:21,546 --> 01:07:22,671
She's slim.

882
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:28,046
When her boobs swing
wildly as she rides my cock,

883
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:30,088
it'll be heaven, I swear.

884
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:36,505
She's skinny, so she can bounce
on my cock for at least half an hour.

885
01:07:37,755 --> 01:07:40,421
Perfect girl to date for six months.

886
01:07:42,546 --> 01:07:44,796
She seems conservative.

887
01:07:45,755 --> 01:07:47,630
But once I get her in bed,

888
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:49,755
I'd fuck her brains out.

889
01:07:49,963 --> 01:07:54,755
She'll keep coming back for
more even after she gets married.

890
01:07:56,296 --> 01:07:57,630
Have you gone nuts?

891
01:07:58,963 --> 01:07:59,963
What shit you are saying?

892
01:08:01,963 --> 01:08:08,005
Basically, I want to invest
my time on the bank girl.

893
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:10,755
So I'll be unable to give you much time.
No option.

894
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,463
We have to break up.

895
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:14,421
No option.

896
01:08:18,255 --> 01:08:19,755
Don't stretch the joke.

897
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:22,963
Where did this girl come from suddenly?

898
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:27,421
At least, find a good excuse to break up.

899
01:08:28,088 --> 01:08:29,255
Not suddenly.

900
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:31,796
She's been giving me
signals for a month now.

901
01:08:32,463 --> 01:08:34,088
And I've been reciprocating too.

902
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:39,421
If you don't believe me,

903
01:08:39,755 --> 01:08:43,505
I'll call you when I
fuck her for the first time.

904
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:47,130
If she allows, you can shoot us.

905
01:08:48,088 --> 01:08:51,255
And if you want,
join in after setting up the camera.

906
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,505
You're bullshitting.

907
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,880
I know it.

908
01:09:01,546 --> 01:09:02,588
Actually,

909
01:09:03,463 --> 01:09:05,005
come with me to the bank tomorrow.

910
01:09:10,338 --> 01:09:13,088
I am your third boyfriend
since school, right?

911
01:09:14,963 --> 01:09:20,380
And one of them was a foolish married
teacher who got fired thanks to you.

912
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,796
You're low on looks
but high on experience.

913
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:32,421
When you see her talking to me, you'll see

914
01:09:32,505 --> 01:09:33,755
where it's heading.

915
01:09:37,713 --> 01:09:39,296
So what if I had three boyfriends!

916
01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:43,838
Would you know if I hadn't told you?

917
01:09:46,171 --> 01:09:47,755
Do you think I'm a slut?

918
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:49,630
Is that why you're leaving me?

919
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:55,671
You think like a typical man or woman.

920
01:09:57,005 --> 01:09:58,838
Even I've had girlfriends,

921
01:09:59,838 --> 01:10:01,838
Does that make me a man-slut?

922
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:04,296
See, the thing is...

923
01:10:04,505 --> 01:10:06,505
Either a man leaves a woman

924
01:10:06,963 --> 01:10:08,421
or she leaves him.

925
01:10:10,046 --> 01:10:15,755
Lucky are the lovers who part mutually.

926
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,088
Anyway, we are both
are unlucky in general.

927
01:10:21,671 --> 01:10:24,421
Why leave this lucky
chance to break up mutually?

928
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:26,588
Agreed?

929
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,380
What wrong have I done?

930
01:10:35,088 --> 01:10:37,505
No matter what you
do and how you treat me...

931
01:10:39,421 --> 01:10:40,921
I love you.

932
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,380
Look...

933
01:10:49,088 --> 01:10:50,088
Look...

934
01:10:51,546 --> 01:10:53,421
I won't fight with you today onwards.

935
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:55,421
I won't cry either.

936
01:10:56,546 --> 01:10:58,796
Marriage can wait too.

937
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,880
And if you don't want it, then we won't.

938
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,963
And if you want to leave
me after marriage, you can.

939
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:10,505
But don't leave me now
for another girl, please.

940
01:11:11,838 --> 01:11:13,171
I beg you.

941
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,671
It's only you,

942
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:19,921
who really talks to me.

943
01:11:21,338 --> 01:11:22,880
You curse me,

944
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:26,171
but

945
01:11:26,921 --> 01:11:30,546
at least I know you care.

946
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,171
Listen, do one thing.

947
01:11:38,588 --> 01:11:39,546
You..

948
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,505
You... you'll leave that girl
once you're done with her, right?

949
01:11:43,713 --> 01:11:44,796
I'm okay with that.

950
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:47,588
I'll accept her as your
mistress for six months.

951
01:11:48,546 --> 01:11:51,255
Even if you can't
meet me while dating her,

952
01:11:51,546 --> 01:11:52,880
I'll bear with it.

953
01:11:53,505 --> 01:11:56,380
Just speak to me on the phone
for an hour every day, please.

954
01:11:58,588 --> 01:12:03,255
I am tired of living like this.

955
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,005
If you leave me like this,

956
01:12:09,546 --> 01:12:10,588
I'll do something.

957
01:12:14,338 --> 01:12:15,546
You'll commit suicide?

958
01:12:16,713 --> 01:12:18,213
If you leave me, I will.

959
01:12:18,921 --> 01:12:20,088
What will that achieve?

960
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,588
You want me to die?

961
01:12:25,713 --> 01:12:28,463
First answer me,
what will suicide achieve?

962
01:12:29,171 --> 01:12:30,880
I don't want to live without you.

963
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:32,421
I know that.

964
01:12:35,005 --> 01:12:39,880
But tell me, what will suicide achieve?

965
01:12:43,296 --> 01:12:44,588
You will feel bad.

966
01:12:45,463 --> 01:12:46,463
So?

967
01:12:50,005 --> 01:12:51,921
So you won't live happily.

968
01:12:54,796 --> 01:12:57,046
As if I am jumping with joy now!

969
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:00,213
One more sorrow will add up.
What difference would it make?

970
01:13:01,088 --> 01:13:02,005
How would I know?

971
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,088
I'd be dead.

972
01:13:11,171 --> 01:13:12,255
What would you do after death?

973
01:13:14,671 --> 01:13:16,755
Do you believe in the afterlife?

974
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:21,713
There must be something.

975
01:13:23,005 --> 01:13:24,630
Heaven or hell.

976
01:13:26,046 --> 01:13:27,046
You're sure it exists?

977
01:13:28,296 --> 01:13:30,088
You're sure it doesn't?

978
01:13:32,005 --> 01:13:33,421
If it does,

979
01:13:35,213 --> 01:13:37,880
you'd still be a tortured
soul like you are now.

980
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:42,171
Yes. What are you trying to say?

981
01:13:43,755 --> 01:13:44,755
Nothing.

982
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:46,963
Just fucking with you.

983
01:13:47,296 --> 01:13:49,338
It's fun seeing you all worked up.

984
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,380
You're an asshole.

985
01:13:51,463 --> 01:13:52,838
Tell me something new.

986
01:13:53,088 --> 01:13:54,755
Please don't break up with me.

987
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:03,671
Fine, I won't.

988
01:14:09,005 --> 01:14:10,171
And that girl?

989
01:14:14,213 --> 01:14:15,213
Which girl?

990
01:14:17,088 --> 01:14:19,796
Bastard, you were lying to me?

991
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:25,255
We all need some drama in life.

992
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:28,421
This is how you create it.

993
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:32,380
Our life is not like a movie

994
01:14:32,505 --> 01:14:34,713
or like a bank scam,
always rife with drama.

995
01:14:36,463 --> 01:14:37,630
What difference does it make?

996
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,546
And even if it does, who cares?

997
01:14:43,338 --> 01:14:45,463
I don't know what you're saying.

998
01:14:46,671 --> 01:14:47,671
Neither do I.

999
01:14:50,463 --> 01:14:52,588
And even if I did, so what?

1000
01:15:01,005 --> 01:15:02,755
I'll go back to the hostel now.

1001
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,088
Sunita will be back.

1002
01:15:06,296 --> 01:15:07,755
Have to listen to her sob story as well.

1003
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:10,796
And we have to cook chicken
for the hostel folks as well.

1004
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:13,921
Let Sunita go to hell. You stay here.

1005
01:15:14,338 --> 01:15:15,380
No way.

1006
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:19,005
I've had enough of your bile for a day.

1007
01:15:22,088 --> 01:15:23,463
What's your scene tomorrow?

1008
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:26,088
Office.

1009
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:27,630
On a Sunday?

1010
01:15:29,255 --> 01:15:32,171
Yes. We have two months
of backlog to clear.

1011
01:15:33,255 --> 01:15:36,088
Didn't you all clear that last week?

1012
01:15:37,296 --> 01:15:41,505
Yes. We did.
But my boss said that...

1013
01:15:42,963 --> 01:15:44,588
Actually I'm not sure.

1014
01:15:44,963 --> 01:15:49,838
He has called me, Amit, Sudhir and Nisha.

1015
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,921
And Sudhir's mom is having
that kidney dial... what is it called?

1016
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:57,755
Dialysis.
Yes. That.

1017
01:15:58,546 --> 01:16:00,296
He's still called Sudhir to work.

1018
01:16:02,838 --> 01:16:04,421
So when will you get free tomorrow?

1019
01:16:05,338 --> 01:16:06,588
Don't know.

1020
01:16:09,088 --> 01:16:10,130
Then let's go.

1021
01:16:12,046 --> 01:16:13,046
Where?

1022
01:16:13,963 --> 01:16:14,880
To fuck.

1023
01:16:15,296 --> 01:16:16,463
Please tell me.

1024
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,296
Told you, to fuck.

1025
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,713
What?

1026
01:16:21,796 --> 01:16:23,755
I'll have to look at porn
and jack off tomorrow anyway.

1027
01:16:24,171 --> 01:16:26,130
Since you are here right now, come.

1028
01:16:26,838 --> 01:16:28,755
We just did it in the theatre.

1029
01:16:29,755 --> 01:16:33,505
That was furtive and anxious.
Don't fuck my brains now.

1030
01:16:34,463 --> 01:16:35,463
Just come.

1031
01:16:36,963 --> 01:16:41,463
You can't think of anything besides pussy,
cock and ass. Can you?

1032
01:16:48,046 --> 01:16:51,088
We only meet properly on
Saturdays and Sundays, correct?

1033
01:16:54,005 --> 01:16:55,838
If you're on your period,
then it's a no-go.

1034
01:16:56,921 --> 01:16:59,880
And on holidays, you meet your mother.

1035
01:17:00,588 --> 01:17:04,921
Now I get this time-table, but
my cock doesn't. When will you get that?

1036
01:17:07,338 --> 01:17:10,421
The other stuff I think about,
you don't get it anyway.

1037
01:17:11,005 --> 01:17:12,380
So why waste time talking
about anything else?

1038
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:18,171
Even when you're talking
about politics and society

1039
01:17:18,255 --> 01:17:21,588
it's all about cock,
ass and fucking.

1040
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:23,421
What's the difference?

1041
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:26,463
First time you've cracked a good joke!

1042
01:17:27,005 --> 01:17:29,213
I'm not as dumb as you think.

1043
01:17:29,921 --> 01:17:33,963
Then come!
Show off your smartness at the lodge.

1044
01:17:34,046 --> 01:17:37,088
Fine. I give up.

1045
01:17:39,046 --> 01:17:41,838
Are you doing me a favor?
Or am I begging you?

1046
01:17:43,796 --> 01:17:45,630
If you have the energy to fuck then come,

1047
01:17:46,255 --> 01:17:50,296
else I can always hire cheap whores
nearby to lick my ass like in porn videos.

1048
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:53,005
Don't call me a whore, motherfucker!

1049
01:17:53,755 --> 01:17:56,255
I crave this angry
cat-like energy of yours!

1050
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,838
I hate fucking dead fish, anyway

1051
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:00,755
First apologize for calling me a whore.

1052
01:18:02,921 --> 01:18:04,463
Sorry. Come on.

1053
01:18:08,713 --> 01:18:10,588
I am sorry. Forgive me.

1054
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:27,505
Fine, I am your whore, you're my customer
and God's the pimp who made us meet.

1055
01:18:29,588 --> 01:18:30,588
Happy now?

1056
01:18:31,671 --> 01:18:34,213
I have to go with friends
at night to smoke weed.

1057
01:18:34,546 --> 01:18:36,463
Why don't you stop smoking weed.

1058
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:41,630
Only makes your volatile
mood swings worse.

1059
01:18:41,713 --> 01:18:46,130
I can leave you at the hostel,
sweetheart... but not weed.

1060
01:18:48,671 --> 01:18:49,546
Fuck.

1061
01:18:49,921 --> 01:18:50,921
What's wrong?

1062
01:18:52,005 --> 01:18:54,005
I shouldn't have brought
up the topic of weed.

1063
01:18:54,713 --> 01:18:56,130
Why? What happened?

1064
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:59,630
Nothing's happened...

1065
01:19:00,755 --> 01:19:01,880
but it will.

1066
01:19:20,671 --> 01:19:22,296
Please don't do it, love.

1067
01:19:22,838 --> 01:19:24,046
Please don't!

1068
01:19:24,588 --> 01:19:26,505
I'm not comfortable.

1069
01:19:29,046 --> 01:19:30,255
Listen!

1070
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:41,630
Listen!

1071
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:51,630
What?

1072
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:00,630
You're not comfortable?

1073
01:20:11,713 --> 01:20:12,755
Drink this.

1074
01:20:15,505 --> 01:20:16,338
No.

1075
01:20:17,213 --> 01:20:18,046
No....

1076
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:19,505
Have it... You'll get comfortable.

1077
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:21,213
Don't do it. See...

1078
01:20:30,213 --> 01:20:31,213
Ah,

1079
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:32,421
now I can see.

1080
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,588
Your boobs are sagging

1081
01:20:39,296 --> 01:20:40,588
Why don't you get breast firming serum?

1082
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:47,005
Or massage oil after
bath and before sleeping.

1083
01:20:47,838 --> 01:20:50,921
Look at me,
talking like an idiot instead of fucking.

1084
01:20:52,338 --> 01:20:53,338
Look...

1085
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,255
Today I want to fuck your
ass...I'll do the rest later.

1086
01:20:58,505 --> 01:21:00,338
Will you take off
your panties or should I?

1087
01:21:00,838 --> 01:21:02,255
I'll do whatever you want.

1088
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,213
But please switch off the mobile.

1089
01:21:05,755 --> 01:21:07,338
I'll delete it later.

1090
01:21:07,546 --> 01:21:09,005
Pull the undies down.

1091
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:20,088
Mine first.

1092
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:26,921
Do I need to tell you everything?

1093
01:21:40,421 --> 01:21:41,796
You haven't shaved your pussy?

1094
01:21:44,796 --> 01:21:47,546
It hurts. Please do it slowly.

1095
01:21:49,796 --> 01:21:53,838
Have you lost it! I am leaving.

1096
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:57,505
Don't leave. Don't leave me.

1097
01:21:57,713 --> 01:22:03,963
I... I was trying to imitate porn.

1098
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:07,255
I won't bite anymore.

1099
01:22:08,088 --> 01:22:09,338
Did it hurt a lot?

1100
01:22:17,755 --> 01:22:18,921
What are you doing, love?

1101
01:22:19,463 --> 01:22:20,796
Have you gone nuts?

1102
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:23,963
You never hit me.

1103
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:28,088
So, I thought I'll hit myself.

1104
01:22:29,838 --> 01:22:32,713
I've told you so many times,
not to smoke weed.

1105
01:22:32,796 --> 01:22:33,796
Why then?

1106
01:22:34,838 --> 01:22:36,921
I won't smoke after this. Promise.

1107
01:22:38,588 --> 01:22:39,796
Promise?

1108
01:22:42,296 --> 01:22:43,755
I swear on my dick.

1109
01:22:44,255 --> 01:22:45,505
Bastard.

1110
01:22:54,713 --> 01:22:55,963
What are you looking for?

1111
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:00,671
Please tell.

1112
01:23:02,713 --> 01:23:03,713
Ah!

1113
01:23:03,963 --> 01:23:04,963
Got it.

1114
01:23:09,046 --> 01:23:10,255
What's this for?

1115
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:14,046
Your pussy must be in pain,

1116
01:23:15,963 --> 01:23:17,588
so I'll apply this.

1117
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:19,338
You'll feel better.

1118
01:23:20,755 --> 01:23:25,255
Okay? Come. Lie down.

1119
01:23:55,005 --> 01:23:57,171
You'd planned to bite me from before?

1120
01:23:58,213 --> 01:23:59,255
No, why?

1121
01:23:59,671 --> 01:24:01,755
Then why did you carry
Vaseline in your bag?

1122
01:24:02,505 --> 01:24:04,880
Oh... this?

1123
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:08,671
Because today I had intended
to fuck you from behind!

1124
01:24:09,921 --> 01:24:11,921
Your pussy's always loose.

1125
01:24:14,505 --> 01:24:15,671
Dry too.

1126
01:24:16,963 --> 01:24:17,796
And

1127
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:22,130
spit dries up quickly in your pussy

1128
01:24:22,796 --> 01:24:24,880
It'd be no good in the ass.

1129
01:24:25,296 --> 01:24:29,255
That's why I got Vaseline.

1130
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,755
No. You've bitten me way too hard.

1131
01:24:31,921 --> 01:24:33,838
I won't allow you from behind today.

1132
01:24:35,046 --> 01:24:36,046
Today?

1133
01:24:43,505 --> 01:24:46,005
When did you let me
fuck from behind before?

1134
01:24:46,963 --> 01:24:52,421
I mean .... I mean, not today.

1135
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:54,963
Some other day.

1136
01:24:57,421 --> 01:24:58,921
Today you have to let me.

1137
01:25:00,088 --> 01:25:06,838
Get fucked every moment,
this very moment....

1138
01:25:07,713 --> 01:25:08,713
Don't joke.

1139
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:12,088
At least let me fuck your ass.

1140
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:16,213
What's wrong?

1141
01:25:26,963 --> 01:25:28,546
Okay.

1142
01:25:29,005 --> 01:25:31,171
Let's do our regular thing. Fine?

1143
01:25:31,838 --> 01:25:33,213
Turn off the cellphone first.

1144
01:25:36,255 --> 01:25:37,963
Let it record at least.

1145
01:25:38,755 --> 01:25:40,796
Then you can delete it yourself.

1146
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:43,588
How can I trust you?
What if you go back on your word later?

1147
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:46,255
It's been recording till now.

1148
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:49,338
A bit more won't matter.

1149
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:09,755
Satisfied?

1150
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:13,171
Can I continue now?

1151
01:26:13,838 --> 01:26:18,421
I thought that...
you don't mind me deleting it?

1152
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:19,630
No.

1153
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:25,338
I had anyway thought I would...

1154
01:26:25,838 --> 01:26:26,671
let it go.

1155
01:26:26,755 --> 01:26:28,630
No. Tell me what you were thinking.

1156
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:43,463
Take it deeper, my queen.

1157
01:27:44,546 --> 01:27:49,588
It needs to be longer to go deeper,
my king. Right?

1158
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:04,796
Continue. Continue.

1159
01:28:06,755 --> 01:28:08,880
If you're tired of my dick,
lick my balls as well.

1160
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:14,005
And when you're tired of that,
lick my asshole too.

1161
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,588
Don't stop.

1162
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,796
You ask me to shave.

1163
01:28:18,421 --> 01:28:20,463
Ever seen your own hair in the mirror?

1164
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,546
Open your mouth for
just one thing, darling.

1165
01:28:24,796 --> 01:28:26,171
Keep licking.

1166
01:28:27,588 --> 01:28:30,671
I'll puke, I am warning you.

1167
01:28:32,796 --> 01:28:34,880
We just took a shower half an hour back.

1168
01:28:36,046 --> 01:28:38,213
Don't worry.
My asshole's clean as a whistle.

1169
01:28:38,838 --> 01:28:40,088
Please...

1170
01:28:42,338 --> 01:28:45,171
Now go on sucking. Should I beg you?

1171
01:28:46,338 --> 01:28:48,005
Time's passing by.

1172
01:29:00,921 --> 01:29:02,130
Breathe deeper.

1173
01:29:08,046 --> 01:29:09,796
Put in your tongue. There.

1174
01:29:12,505 --> 01:29:13,505
Twirl your tongue.

1175
01:29:14,671 --> 01:29:15,671
Twirl it.

1176
01:29:22,588 --> 01:29:24,088
Bite if you want to.

1177
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:36,005
Come up here... come.
Fuck me harder, love!

1178
01:29:39,171 --> 01:29:41,588
Let your cock tear my pussy apart.

1179
01:29:43,005 --> 01:29:44,296
Fuck me, love.

1180
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:47,463
Don't stop!

1181
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,963
Harder, harder...

1182
01:29:50,671 --> 01:29:51,671
Rape that hole

1183
01:29:52,296 --> 01:29:53,546
Rape me!

1184
01:29:58,088 --> 01:29:59,796
It hurts, love...

1185
01:30:05,213 --> 01:30:06,505
Make me wet, make me bleed!

1186
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:12,588
It hurts so much...

1187
01:30:16,255 --> 01:30:17,255
But I love the pain!

1188
01:30:19,671 --> 01:30:23,005
I'm going crazy...

1189
01:30:24,963 --> 01:30:28,088
Don't stop. Don't Stop. Don't Stop.

1190
01:30:51,421 --> 01:30:54,171
Please... please don't, it hurts a lot.

1191
01:30:55,505 --> 01:30:57,880
Didn't you promise not to hurt me?

1192
01:31:00,338 --> 01:31:02,755
The last time you had an abortion,
it can't hurt more than that right?

1193
01:31:05,046 --> 01:31:06,713
You can take this much pain.

1194
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,380
Please don't do it, darling.

1195
01:31:13,213 --> 01:31:15,671
I was giving you pleasure till now,
wasn't I?

1196
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:18,838
Pleasure?

1197
01:31:20,838 --> 01:31:21,838
From you?

1198
01:31:32,296 --> 01:31:36,546
Every time I fuck you I imagine
someone else's face, got it!

1199
01:31:39,171 --> 01:31:40,671
These days I can't even do that.

1200
01:31:40,755 --> 01:31:43,005
Your rotten face is stuck in my head.

1201
01:31:44,046 --> 01:31:45,838
Bitch, giving me pleasure?

1202
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:54,338
Can't bear to see your face while fucking,
that's why I wanted to fuck your ass.

1203
01:31:59,963 --> 01:32:02,421
Hide the face and fuck the
base- that's all you're good for.

1204
01:32:02,671 --> 01:32:03,671
Do you know that?

1205
01:32:06,463 --> 01:32:10,880
No one will even touch you,
if they're not high.

1206
01:32:18,505 --> 01:32:20,255
You want me to rape you?

1207
01:32:23,755 --> 01:32:25,755
You'd puke if you lick my asshole?

1208
01:32:26,838 --> 01:32:31,255
Even kissing you can make one puke, bitch.

1209
01:32:35,796 --> 01:32:37,755
Quit these tantrums and give me your ass.
It'll be fine. Come on.

1210
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:40,130
How do you know it'll be fine?

1211
01:32:40,255 --> 01:32:42,171
Motherfucker, how do you know?

1212
01:32:42,255 --> 01:32:46,338
Did you put someone else's cock in your
ass, when you couldn't get a girl to fuck?

1213
01:32:47,088 --> 01:32:50,380
You tiny-dicked eunuch!
You're just a piece of shit!

1214
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:16,630
Now tell me.

1215
01:33:17,963 --> 01:33:19,130
Am I shit?

1216
01:33:19,546 --> 01:33:20,546
Speak up.

1217
01:33:21,046 --> 01:33:22,380
Speak now.

1218
01:33:22,921 --> 01:33:24,546
You wanted to be raped, right? Take this.

1219
01:33:26,838 --> 01:33:30,380
Who knows how many have
torn your cunt till date!

1220
01:33:30,463 --> 01:33:33,088
You're trying to teach me?
Bitch!

1221
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,463
I'm not a bad guy.

1222
01:36:17,088 --> 01:36:18,213
Say something, please.

1223
01:36:31,005 --> 01:36:32,005
Please!

1224
01:36:40,046 --> 01:36:41,046
Laugh.

1225
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:51,630
What?

1226
01:36:54,171 --> 01:36:55,171
Laugh.

1227
01:37:02,046 --> 01:37:03,296
Laugh loudly.

1228
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:16,963
Can you?

1229
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:24,630
Loudly.

1230
01:37:26,463 --> 01:37:27,713
Louder.

1231
01:37:37,755 --> 01:37:39,838
Keep laughing.

1232
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:46,046
I'll send it to you.

1233
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:06,755
Will you marry me?

1234
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:15,755
I thought about it a lot.

1235
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:21,213
I'll never find someone
who loves me this much.

1236
01:38:26,421 --> 01:38:27,463
Let's get married.

1237
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:32,880
Then whatever happens, we'll see.

1238
01:38:36,338 --> 01:38:37,380
I've seen it already.

1239
01:38:42,255 --> 01:38:44,338
This won't happen again.

1240
01:38:45,505 --> 01:38:47,505
I promise you.

1241
01:38:49,796 --> 01:38:51,588
I can't do this again either.

1242
01:38:52,546 --> 01:38:53,963
I've promised myself.

1243
01:38:58,088 --> 01:38:59,088
Look.

1244
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:04,171
This is real life. Not a movie.

1245
01:39:05,255 --> 01:39:06,588
Don't throw dialogues at me.

1246
01:39:08,505 --> 01:39:10,130
Well, here's one more.

1247
01:39:11,463 --> 01:39:13,046
Movies or life -

1248
01:39:13,963 --> 01:39:15,380
both end eventually.

1249
01:39:18,088 --> 01:39:19,213
So has this.

1250
01:39:21,171 --> 01:39:22,171
Please!

1251
01:39:23,755 --> 01:39:25,838
Don't leave me like this.

1252
01:39:26,713 --> 01:39:28,463
I'll die without you.

1253
01:39:32,588 --> 01:39:35,005
What difference does it make?

1254
01:39:42,713 --> 01:39:43,796
So are you about me!

1255
01:39:47,838 --> 01:39:49,380
A lot.

1256
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:53,796
Even if it does, who cares, silly!

1257
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:17,755
I am crazy about you.

1258
01:41:17,838 --> 01:41:18,838
So are you about me!

1259
01:41:18,921 --> 01:41:21,213
My kind of love, you have never known.

1260
01:41:21,296 --> 01:41:23,630
Our hearts are taking a path less walked!

1261
01:41:23,713 --> 01:41:25,796
Tell me, oh love, where should I go?

1262
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:26,838
I am crazy about you.

1263
01:41:26,921 --> 01:41:28,046
So are you about me!

1264
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:30,380

Our hearts are taking a path less walked!

1266
01:41:32,796 --> 01:41:34,963
Tell me, oh love, where should I go?

1267
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:46,255
Heart, heart, heart,
this crazy heart of mine.

1268
01:41:46,338 --> 01:41:48,671
Don't misunderstand
this craziness of mine.

1269
01:41:48,755 --> 01:41:53,255
What kind of chaos is this?

1270
01:41:53,338 --> 01:41:55,588
Heart, heart, heart,
this crazy heart of mine.

1271
01:41:55,671 --> 01:41:57,880
Don't misunderstand
this craziness of mine.

1272
01:41:57,963 --> 01:42:02,546
What kind of chaos is this?

1273
01:42:04,588 --> 01:42:05,713
I am crazy about you.

1274
01:42:05,796 --> 01:42:06,796
So are you about me!

1275
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,171
My kind of love, you have never known.

1276
01:42:09,255 --> 01:42:11,588
Our hearts are taking a path less walked!

1277
01:42:11,671 --> 01:42:13,838
Tell me, oh love, where should I go?

1278
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:16,171
I am crazy about you.

1279
01:42:16,963 --> 01:42:18,171
So are you about me!

1280
01:42:23,005 --> 01:42:23,963

Tell me, oh love, where should I go?

1290
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:23,338
I am crazy about you.

1291

My love is stubborn, yet naive.

1296
01:43:51,963 --> 01:43:54,130
You just don't get it.

1297
01:43:54,463 --> 01:43:56,588
Let the world be jealous,
people be jealous.

1298
01:43:56,671 --> 01:43:58,755
Dear, why do you despair?

1299
01:43:58,838 --> 01:44:01,130
My love is stubborn, yet naive.

1300
01:44:01,213 --> 01:44:03,546
You just don't get it.

1301
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:05,796
Let the world be jealous,
people be jealous.

1302
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,046
Dear, why do you despair?

1303

Stop the film.

Listen, stop!
