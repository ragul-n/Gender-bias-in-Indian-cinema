1
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,360
Barkha!

2
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,720
Barkha!

3
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,180
Did you get it?

4
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,250
Here it is.

5
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,260
Thanks, Mel.

6
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,850
This is the last time,
you’ll be thanking me.

7
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,150
I can't get anymore medicines
for you on this prescription.

8
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,440
Really sorry, boss.

9
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,800
The pharmacist said the
prescription's quite old.

10
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,690
I'll figure out something
when I need more pills.

11
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,680
This will be enough for the time being.

12
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,160
Your cast came off two weeks ago.

13
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,760
You have no problem walking either.

14
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,220
I don’t think you are in pain.

15
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,030
Boss, I think you are addicted to them.

16
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,920
You're addicted to morphine.

17
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,250
Mel, I asked for a
painkiller not a mother.

18
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,610
I am sorry…

19
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,300
I didn’t mean it that way.

20
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,010
Morning.

21
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,520
Good morning, John.

22
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,910
Where sleeps thy missus?

23
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,950
Back in my bed Sim, back in my bed.

24
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
For now, she decided to
end the games and play house.

25
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,750
Well, that’s good to know.

26
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,340
If you need me to pay her another visit,
it’s on the house for you.

27
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,770
Did Sid call when I was in court?

28
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,110
No, he didn’t.

29
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,030
What’s my first appointment?

30
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,830
Well, it was Freddy Owens.

31
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,670
But I have pushed it back an hour…

32
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,080
Due to an urgent request.

33
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,450
Urgent request?

34
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,440
Bob Anand.

35
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,510
Karan Khanna’s election
campaign manager…

36
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,520
He has requested an
urgent meeting with you.

37
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,230
I see.

38
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,440
Thank you, David.
- Thank you, ma’am.

39
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,200
Please.

40
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,410
Yes, of course.

41
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,860
Well, I'm sure you
are aware why I am here.

42
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,270
I am.

43
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,930
I can say with certainty
that Karan didn’t kill his wife.

44
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,520
Mr. Anand, in all these years
my career has certainly taught me

45
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,670
that in this day and age,
no one is innocent.

46
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,320
Even those who look innocent.

47
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,060
But Karan is.

48
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,960
And I can prove that.

49
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,990
Really?

50
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,470
Karan was with me,
the night Barkha was murdered.

51
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,490
I had organised a fundraiser for him.

52
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,140
Many well-known and
powerful people attended it.

53
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,080
Karan had a drink too many.

54
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,070
I'd suggested him not to drive.

55
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,810
And to stay at my place instead.

56
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,460
He was in my house till morning.

57
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,650
I see.

58
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,890
But Mr. Anand,
this is just a statement given by you.

59
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,310
How is it a proof?

60
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,500
It is possible that you
are lying for Mr. Khanna.

61
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,680
I am just his campaign manager,
not his friend.

62
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,230
Both he and I will lose reputation,
if I lie for him.

63
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,200
Fine, I'll believe
you for the time being.

64
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,320
Ms. Singh,
elections take place in two months.

65
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,280
Opposition will certainly
exploit this scandal.

66
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,010
If this matter escalates, he won't even
get a chance to contest the elections.

67
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,150
His political career will
end even before it begins.

68
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,870
Karan has come a long way, to be here.

69
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,520
To become an MP is his dream.

70
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,990
He actually wants to do
something for his community.

71
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,620
And I guess this is not
possible while he is in prison.

72
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,080
That's why I have come to you.

73
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,630
Look Mr. Anand,
I am not promising anything

74
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,270
but I'd like a
meeting with Mr. Khanna.

75
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,910
And after that I'll decide whether
or not I want to take on this case.

76
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,180
Sure.

77
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,540
I’ll be waiting outside.

78
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,430
Thank you.

79
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,270
You’re welcome.

80
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,520
'Inmates of Cell B,
C, D who are not engaged in any work'

81
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,410
'are ordered to assemble
in the assembly area.'

82
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,700
'I repeat.'

83
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,060
'Inmates of Cell B,
C, D who are not engaged in any work'

84
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,430
'are ordered to assemble
in the assembly ground.'

85
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,550
Behave yourself!

86
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,230
They have handcuffed me.

87
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,450
It's surely not necessary
for this meeting.

88
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,450
Trust me.

89
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,990
It’s too soon to trust you.

90
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,250
If you think that I have…
- What I think doesn't matter.

91
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,890
What I can prove is what matters.

92
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,890
What do you mean?
- Mr. Khanna

93
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,670
I mean it honestly
makes no difference to me

94
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,850
whether or not you
have murdered your wife.

95
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,350
But it would certainly make
a difference to your defence.

96
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,350
So it'd be better for you, if you honestly
tell me what happened that night.

97
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,140
Because if the prosecution
knows something I don’t know

98
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,770
then it could become
a big problem for you.

99
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,340
I am not lying.

100
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,670
The truth is that I am innocent.

101
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,450
I didn’t kill my wife.

102
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,890
Police got this footage from
the CCTV camera in your house.

103
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,510
You went home at two on
the night your wife was murdered.

104
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,760
You left home again at four.

105
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,800
And then, went back at half past six.

106
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,590
Police has arrested
you on the basis of this.

107
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,170
I know.

108
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,590
Then you also know that Bob's alibi
won't work because of these photos.

109
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,830
So you see Mr. Khanna,
the truth isn’t what you believe in

110
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,120
the truth is what you can prove.

111
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,550
I spent the night at Bob's.

112
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,450
This is not me.

113
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,890
Fine.

114
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,220
Then we'll tell the jury
that he's your evil twin

115
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,180
who got separated at a fair in London.

116
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,070
You think this is funny?

117
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,460
You are the one who thinks
that both the law and I are a joke!

118
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,560
I am helpless here, the facts are such.

119
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,830
The more truth I tell you,
the more you'll think that I am lying.

120
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,330
You have no other option
other than to tell me the truth.

121
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,040
Our home is haunted by a spirit.

122
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,300
Barkha and I,
we both have felt its presence.

123
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,470
That spirit killed Barkha.

124
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,670
My wife…

125
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,090
she was killed by a ghost.

126
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,890
I told you, you won't believe me.

127
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,390
If you think a ghost
has killed your wife…

128
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,120
Well, I can't argue with that.

129
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,050
I mean, I too haven’t seen God.

130
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,190
But that doesn't mean there is no God.

131
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,140
But unfortunately Mr. Khanna,
law is applicable only to humans…

132
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,900
And not to ghosts and spirits.

133
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,240
So you see, I can't help you.

134
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,770
You need a black magic expert…

135
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,400
And not a legal expert.

136
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,440
Ms. Simran…

137
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,630
There comes a point in everyone's life

138
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,220
when they need someone
to believe in them.

139
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,970
Even one person is enough.

140
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,480
And I thought, perhaps,
you are that one person for me.

141
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,660
Goodbye, Mr. Khanna.

142
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,060
Hello!

143
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,860
Is anyone there?

144
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,530
Mr. Khanna, we can still save your wife.

145
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,770
Come.

146
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,960
Look at these photographs.

147
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,180
This incident took place last night.

148
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,530
Karan thought he
was having a nightmare

149
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,750
but these marks were
on his body when he woke up.

150
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,400
Mr. Anand,
you know that we cannot prove anything

151
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,500
in the court on the
basis of these photographs.

152
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:34,820
I am sorry.

153
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,410
I am not asking you to prove anything.

154
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,920
I am just requesting
you to believe Karan.

155
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,510
If you cannot fight this case
then at least help him get bail.

156
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,490
Fine.

157
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,910
But I need some time to think.

158
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,240
Thank you.

159
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,880
That means a lot.

160
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,610
I haven't said yes as yet, Mr. Anand.

161
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,510
All I said is I’ll think about it.

162
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,760
I know but for now,
that’s more than enough.

163
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,580
Hi.
- Hi.

164
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,320
We have a table in
the name of Sid Sharma?

165
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,480
Oh, yes, of course.

166
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,460
He is waiting for you
at a table by the window.

167
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,830
Allow me to show you.

168
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,330
He is right over there.

169
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,890
Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

170
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,010
Hi!

171
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,800
I’m so sorry I’m late.

172
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,710
You won’t believe
I got such a strange case today.

173
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,760
I actually wanted
to discuss it with you.

174
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,600
Sorry.

175
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,640
It’s fine.
- I got late because of it.

176
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,950
Let's order first.

177
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,860
We can talk later.

178
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,530
Sid, are you okay?

179
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,370
No hi, no hello.

180
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,350
I didn’t even get
a proper courtesy kiss.

181
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,560
You jumped straight into ordering food!

182
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,010
I don’t have time for
all these formalities.

183
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,310
I need to go back to court.

184
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,700
I need to review a lot of cases.

185
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,560
Okay…

186
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,420
Even I go to court and have cases, Sid.

187
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,350
And I know that you're
one of the youngest judges

188
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,100
and I am just an ordinary lawyer.

189
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,140
But you can't be so busy that you
can't spare time to make a phone call.

190
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,100
I don’t have time for all these things.

191
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,670
Please, Simran.

192
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,890
Let's finish lunch so that we
can go back to our respective offices.

193
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,240
What’s wrong with you, Sid?

194
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,900
Why are you so upset?

195
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,630
You have even started ignoring
my phone calls and messages.

196
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,670
What changed between us suddenly?

197
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,660
Fuck, Simmi!

198
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,830
Not again!

199
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,150
I am so sorry.

200
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,240
I can’t do this anymore.

201
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,410
I’m leaving.

202
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,750
Sid!

203
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,140
Did you just walk out on me?

204
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,680
Why are you so upset?
What have I done?

205
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,170
From the time your dad died,
you are using pain as an excuse

206
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,350
to justify your morphine addiction!

207
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,440
It’s crazy.

208
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,730
You have no clue about
the pain I feel, Sid.

209
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,350
You don’t know how deep my pain is!

210
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,820
That is the point.

211
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,220
That is the point, Simran.
I have no clue.

212
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,900
But, as your boyfriend, I should.

213
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,620
I don’t know what screwed you up.

214
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,150
Whether it was your parents divorce

215
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,610
or the fact that you have
issues about being the only child.

216
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,500
But you don’t share anything with me.

217
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,130
I share everything with you!

218
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,170
I am…
- Sid, I tell you everything!

219
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,880
I am talking about
your feelings, Simran!

220
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,060
I am talking about your feelings!
You don’t share them with anyone!

221
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,480
You know what?
You…

222
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,000
you are an emotional miser.
That’s what you are.

223
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,650
You are scared of falling in love…

224
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,520
Of sharing your feelings,
of opening your heart to anyone.

225
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,360
You have built a boundary
around your heart.

226
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,740
"Do not come closer
than this to Simran."

227
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,420
Then you dare to ask,
why I am walking out on you?

228
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,780
That’s not fair, Sid.

229
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
I share everything with you.

230
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,980
You know it.

231
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,940
If that were true,
you'd need me and not these painkillers!

232
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,260
Do you think that I am lying?

233
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,010
That my pain is just an excuse?

234
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,960
I see no wounds or
signs of pain on your body.

235
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,080
Frankly speaking,
it is quite difficult to believe you.

236
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,060
So now, you don’t believe in me?

237
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,510
No.

238
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,500
You know what, Sid?

239
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:07,040
I thought you'd always believe
in me that even if the world doesn't.

240
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,950
But I guess, I was wrong.

241
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,500
I am the one who was wrong, Simran

242
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,350
to waste my emotions
on a girl like you.

243
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,480
I am sorry to say,
but you are a lost cause.

244
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,800
A bad bet.

245
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,720
And I am not going to waste
anymore of my time on you.

246
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,680
'There comes a point
in everyone's life'

247
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,060
'when they need someone
to believe in them.'

248
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,550
'Even one person is enough.'

249
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:14,330
'I thought you'd always believe
in me that even if the world doesn't.'

250
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,100
Hello?

251
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,240
Mr. Anand, let's prepare for Mr.
Khanna's bail.

252
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,590
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

253
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,390
You’re most welcome.

254
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,640
Mel will coordinate with you.
- Yeah, sure.

255
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,800
Hello!

256
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,210
Is someone there?

257
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,240
Lucy

258
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,420
are you still here?

259
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,290
Hello!

260
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,180
Is someone there?

261
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,980
Who’s there?

262
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,600
Your Honor,
Mr. Khanna has been a model citizen.

263
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,700
He’s a public figure and his life
is pretty much out there in the open.

264
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,770
The court will do its due
course in removing

265
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,930
the allegations made against him.

266
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,180
But, until then,
he has responsibilities to fulfill.

267
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,460
Your Honor,
Mr. Khanna is a citizen of Britain

268
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,700
and a responsible electoral candidate.

269
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,810
He will be representing his
constituency in the upcoming elections.

270
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,460
His assets, his businesses,
his earnings all are in this country.

271
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,560
My client is not going anywhere.

272
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,430
He will be here to face the challenges,
levied against him.

273
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,030
The crown is of the opinion that
Mr. Khanna might

274
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,840
after he has been released
try to hamper the investigation.

275
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,070
Talk to witnesses and such.

276
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,610
If it pleases, Your Honor,

277
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,040
my client has agreed for
the state to record

278
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,990
all his telephonic conversations.

279
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,320
He has also agreed to
waive his right to privacy

280
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,490
to make the honourable court
believe in his honest intentions.

281
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,270
Mr. Khanna is it true that
you have resigned from

282
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,660
your candidature and the elections.

283
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,280
Has the party already
selected your replacement?

284
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,210
Mr. Khanna the CCTV images
show that you were clearly at home

285
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,290
he night of the murder.

286
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,620
Where did you come from
and where did you go, Mr. Khanna?

287
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,530
Can you think of anyone
that could’ve killed your wife?

288
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,200
Folks, yes Mr. Khanna will answer
all of your questions just not today.

289
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,070
Please, contact the office
and we will do the necessary.

290
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,290
Oh my! I’m sorry, I’m…

291
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,610
Simran! Simran Wait, please…
Simran…

292
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,880
Sorry you had to see that.

293
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,530
So this is the reason

294
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,940
you didn’t want to
waste your time on me.

295
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,010
You were questioning my truth

296
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,540
because you don’t have
the courage to share yours?

297
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,000
You are overreacting, Simmi.

298
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,320
Whatever we had,
it's all over now.

299
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,490
As we are no longer in a relationship

300
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,500
I can do whatever I want in my life.

301
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,590
You know what?

302
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,530
You’re right.

303
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,170
Go and screw her!

304
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,150
That's what you deserve.

305
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,910
Why this drama?
- No drama.

306
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,720
I came here only to take my things.

307
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,100
I have left the keys upstairs,
in the room.

308
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,370
And you say that
I am an emotional miser.

309
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,900
That I don’t share my feelings.

310
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,050
That I don’t share my pain.

311
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,310
Those painkillers are
more dependable than you are.

312
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,370
They don’t reduce my pain

313
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,220
but they don’t give me
any pain either.

314
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,980
Oh, hello Simran!

315
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,460
Richard.

316
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,830
Simran, I cannot give this
medication from this old prescription.

317
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,800
It’s just that I’ve had
no time to see a doctor and

318
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,310
I’m just in a lot of pain.

319
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,860
If you could just give me the pills.

320
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,600
Simran, you’re a lawyer,
you know the law.

321
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,580
We can get into a big trouble for this.

322
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,170
I’m sorry, I can't…

323
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,410
Thanks for nothing, Richard.

324
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,160
Leona, I need you to find Mel.

325
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,980
Are you okay?

326
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,870
Wherever the hell she is!
Whatever the hell she is doing!

327
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,400
Bring her to me.

328
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,190
Yes ma’am and there’s
someone here to see you.

329
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,540
Not right now Leona, I just…
- Hey, Simran.

330
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,240
Mr. Khanna…

331
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,600
I apologise for showing up without
an appointment but I just wanted to

332
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,810
You’re so…
- Sorry.

333
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,210
Are you okay?
- It’s It’s fine.

334
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,600
You don’t look so good.

335
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,730
I…I just can’t breathe.
I…

336
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,250
Please call for the ambulance.

337
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,800
What do you need?
- I'm just a little tired.

338
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,860
I… I just need to breathe.
- Okay, just…

339
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,900
I just can’t breathe.

340
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,020
Breathe.. I am...

341
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,990
I was in my office…

342
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,170
And now…

343
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,250
What happened to me?

344
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,060
Doctor said it was
a withdrawal attack.

345
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,980
Overuse of morphine
resulted in addiction.

346
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,930
You suffered from severe
withdrawal when you didn’t get any.

347
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,130
I take morphine for pain.

348
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,630
My father passed away
a few weeks ago.

349
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,550
Then I met with an accident.

350
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,110
I sprained my ankle.

351
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,160
I take morphine to manage the pain.

352
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,040
I know this kind of pain.

353
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,750
But in my experience medicines
only heal bodily wounds on the body

354
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,520
and not those on the soul.

355
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,970
You suppress your emotions, don’t you?

356
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,160
I have witnessed many
kinds of pain in life.

357
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,020
You should that my
pain recognises your pain.

358
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,030
Sometimes strangers can understand
things that people close to us cannot.

359
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,940
"So many things that
I haven't shared with anyone…"

360
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,100
"I wish to share them with you."

361
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:10,250
"Why do my eyes seek you?"

362
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,120
"Our souls have bounded."

363
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,940
"I have started following you."

364
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,980
"You are my path, and my destination."

365
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,590
"You are the one I need."

366
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,570
"How do I say that to you?"

367
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,370
"I ask you to surrender yourself to me."

368
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,070
"Our souls have bounded."

369
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,000
"I have started following you."

370
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,910
"You are my path, and my destination."

371
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,550
"You are the one I need."

372
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,340
"How do I say that to you?"

373
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:53,680
"I ask you to surrender yourself to me."

374
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:09,270
"I feel restless."

375
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,800
"I have no patience left…"

376
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,580
"I feel so impatient."

377
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,670
"Breathe life into me…"

378
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:25,080
"My life is at risk."

379
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,620
"I too am a part of you…"

380
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,720
"Don’t hide it from yourself."

381
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,210
"If I am a fragrant flower…"

382
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,270
"You are my garden."

383
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,970
"Our souls have bounded."

384
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,890
"I have started following you."

385
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,810
"You are my path, and my destination."

386
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,440
"You are the one I need."

387
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,420
"How do I say that to you?"

388
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:09,410
"I ask you to surrender yourself to me."

389
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:25,310
"I have no control over
myself from the time I met you."

390
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,210
"Your mesmerising
eyes have bewitched me."

391
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,990
"I hope God will pardon me…"

392
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:40,770
"When I called out to Him,
by mistake I took your name."

393
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:48,750
"You are the happiness
that'll stay with me forever."

394
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,690
For the first time in my life,
I have a house of my own.

395
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,820
After my parents got divorced

396
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,660
I kept shuttling between mom's house,
dad's house and hostels.

397
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,650
Thank you for helping me find this one.

398
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,540
You’re welcome.

399
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,670
Isn't it strange,
you came to me to save your life

400
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,880
but instead ended
up making my life better.

401
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,770
I never said it,
but I'm really grateful.

402
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,100
Thank you.

403
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,990
Happy to help.

404
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,820
Is this a trick to force
me to fight your case?

405
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,290
Well I am a politician,
so I'm bound to have a hidden agenda.

406
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,980
I guess, then it’s a deal.

407
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,370
I'll make sure you don’t go to jail.

408
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,880
And you'll make sure I
don’t end up in the hospital.

409
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,270
Deal.

410
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,140
In legal parlance, we call
it to prove beyond reasonable doubt.

411
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,210
According to the law, till it's
not proven beyond any reasonable doubt

412
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,760
that the accused is guilty
of the crime, he cannot be punished.

413
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,200
We just need to create enough
doubts in the prosecution's case.

414
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,140
The onus of proving the murder
falls on the prosecution and not us.

415
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,260
But we need to understand
prosecution's case for that.

416
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,890
You're right.

417
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,130
But first,
you need to give us your statement.

418
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,930
From the beginning till the end,
everything.

419
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,700
Don’t filter out anything, no
matter how minute you might think it is.

420
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,770
Absolutely no secrets.

421
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,060
On paper, Barkha and I…
we were a good match.

422
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,320
Barkha was getting a chance
to lead an expensive lifestyle.

423
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,390
'And it was the right move
for my political career as well.'

424
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,860
'It was Valentine's day,
I clearly remember.'

425
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:56,600
'Not because it was Valentine's day,
but because that's when it all began.'

426
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:01,950
Who is it?

427
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,980
Er… thank you.

428
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,550
I don’t know.
He delivered this.

429
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,680
What is this?

430
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,930
Wow!

431
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,530
That's quite a romantic gift.

432
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,400
Yes, it is romantic.

433
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,170
Do I know this generous person?

434
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,360
No, no one you know.

435
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,680
In fact, I too don’t know who sent it.

436
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,040
That's great.

437
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,700
You have such a big admirer
and you don’t know who it is?

438
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,020
You didn’t ask the
one who gave it to you?

439
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,720
I asked, but he did not say.

440
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,830
He just gave it and left.

441
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,380
It's obviously some
secret admirer of yours.

442
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,290
Good, at least someone knows
how to express love on Valentine's day.

443
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,370
And you are starving for love.

444
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,460
I know all your excuses.

445
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,320
My husband doesn't
spend any time with me

446
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,650
and so I spend time with other men.

447
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,870
How dare you!

448
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,410
What are you trying to say?

449
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,000
That I am having an affair?

450
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,320
Do you think I am a fool, Barkha?

451
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,730
Do you think I don’t understand

452
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,180
why are you so distracted these days?

453
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,880
It's obvious that there
is someone else in your life.

454
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,950
You got married to me to
take your political career forward.

455
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,130
A married man is more acceptable than
a bachelor is, in an Indian community.

456
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,630
You got married to me
only to please your vote bank.

457
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,260
And you are pulling the love card on me?

458
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,300
I didn’t force you.

459
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,820
You too wanted a life full of luxuries.

460
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,630
There is a ghost in this house, Karan.

461
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,170
There is an evil spirit
which wants to kill me.

462
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,250
It wants to kill me.

463
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,420
I'm really scared, Karan.
And…

464
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,170
It wants to kill me.

465
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,850
I'm really scared,

466
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,860
I know, you won't believe me.

467
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,870
I know that you are speaking the truth.

468
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,140
What?

469
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,440
I too have felt the spirit
you are talking about.

470
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,120
I hear someone laugh and then…

471
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,850
And the bloodstains…

472
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,540
And then, that scary face!

473
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:09,330
Karan, there was nothing
on my arms when I slept last night.

474
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,600
And I had these marks
when I woke up in the morning.

475
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,280
We'll have to find a
solution for whatever this is.

476
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:23,770
'Barkha and I tried hard
to find out whose spirit it is.'

477
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,750
In the name of the father

478
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,260
'What did it want from us?'

479
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,290
and the holy ghost.

480
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,420
'But we failed to learn anything.'
- Bless this house.

481
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,750
'I thought of getting
our house cleansed.'

482
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,790
'To get rid of all impurities.'

483
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,480
In the name of the father
- 'And I did just that.'

484
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,960
and the holy ghost.

485
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,620
'Everything seemed fine
for a few days after that.'

486
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,980
'But then…'

487
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,630
'That morning when I came back home

488
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,220
it was too late.'
- Bless this house.

489
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,260
Barkha was dead.

490
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,910
Why didn’t you two leave that house if
you were facing so many problems there?

491
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,990
We thought about it.

492
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,180
But then…
- I told him not to do anything

493
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,980
which gives media an
opportunity to joke about.

494
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,920
"MP runs from Ghost!"

495
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,330
All these kind of headlines
are not very helpful, are they?

496
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,420
'Bob, I want you to talk
to Karan's party leader.'

497
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,800
'His support is crucial for us.'

498
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,180
Had I been guilty, I would have swiftly
resigned and saved the party any scandals.

499
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,580
But, I’m innocent.

500
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,190
We do believe in your innocence. We do.

501
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,760
But, times are tough, indeed.

502
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,180
Indeed, times are tough. Indeed.

503
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,750
But, I have an idea,
should we all agree.

504
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,080
Excuse me gentlemen,
I have to take this.

505
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,690
My apologies.

506
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,180
I was saying, should we all agree

507
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,760
I have an idea to
get us out of this mess.

508
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,420
If we tell the media…
- Hello. Be home at seven.

509
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,770
Karan Khanna is a
decent and righteous man.

510
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,630
He has honestly worked hard
and earned this name and status.

511
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,760
And you want to make money
because he made a mistake?

512
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,330
Mr. Anand,
decent men don’t make such mistakes.

513
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,670
I told you,
a million pounds is not a small amount.

514
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,070
It's not something found
lying around in the house.

515
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,800
I need time… to arrange for it.

516
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,230
Then arrange for it.

517
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,310
You have 24 hours.

518
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:25,100
After that, I'll go to the
media and expose Karan Khanna.

519
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,200
24 hours.

520
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,620
This can’t be happening.

521
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,530
This is not possible.

522
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,620
Hello.
- Yes?

523
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,190
Is this institute closing down?

524
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,240
Are you an Indian or a Pakistani?

525
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,520
I am an Indian.

526
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,980
Same here, I'm from Birmingham.

527
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,870
So you've been working
here since many years?

528
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,020
Yes, I have.

529
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,610
Do you… recognise her?

530
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,730
How can I forget her?

531
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,440
We are closing down this
institute because of her.

532
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,330
'Hi, this is Karan Khanna.'

533
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,000
'Please leave me a message
and I'll call you back.'

534
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,400
Karan,
I know who that evil spirit is.

535
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,230
I'm coming over to your place.

536
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,210
Then we will go to meet Simran.

537
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,540
Okay?

538
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,060
We are gathered here to say
farewell to Bob Aanand.

539
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,220
And to commit him into
the hands of god.

540
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,420
In the name of the father,
son and holy ghost.

541
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,300
Lord, our god,
you are the source of life.

542
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,440
And you we live and move,
our being.

543
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:13,670
Keep us in life and death.
And by your grace,

544
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,920
'Karan,
I know who that evil spirit is.'

545
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,550
'I'm coming over to your place.'

546
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,300
'Then we will go to meet Simran.'

547
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,670
I don’t know why
is this happening to me!

548
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,730
Where did I go wrong?

549
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,500
What do you mean by
where did you go wrong?

550
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,700
Barkha gets murdered.

551
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,210
I get accused for it.

552
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,640
Now Bob gets killed.

553
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,510
It's like bad things
keep happening around me.

554
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,930
Karan, what happened
to Bob was an accident.

555
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,810
Come on!

556
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,990
He calls us saying
that he knows everything

557
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,150
and the next thing
we know is that he is dead.

558
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,210
I guess, you’re right.

559
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,360
Don’t worry, Karan.

560
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,740
We will find all the answers
when the time is right.

561
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,220
How can I not worry

562
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,800
when the circumstances are
making things so difficult for me!

563
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,490
Karan, no matter how
dire the circumstances are

564
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,020
we can’t let them affect our lives!

565
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,570
It is so easy for you to say that!

566
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,120
And what is that supposed to mean?

567
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,190
You've already decided that
we cannot use the truth in the court.

568
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,580
And whatever you've done so far has
anyway not helped the case much either.

569
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,380
I cannot win against this spirit

570
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,210
but I can at least prove
my innocence in the court

571
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,250
which unfortunately you cannot!

572
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,870
I approached you because Bob insisted.

573
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,230
I told him that we need a wicked lawyer.

574
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,290
A lawyer who knows how to
get things done by bending the rules.

575
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,270
I don’t think you’re
the right lawyer for me.

576
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:49,460
I see.

577
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,570
So, now I’m not right.

578
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,290
You know what, Karan? You’re right.

579
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,780
You should find another
lawyer for yourself.

580
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,700
And leave my house immediately.

581
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,690
The dark shadows in my
life will ruin your life as well.

582
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:44,160
I am willing to stay away from you

583
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,430
because if anything
happens to you because of me

584
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,180
then I won't be
able to forgive myself.

585
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,460
"My heart seeks permission
to beat next to yours."

586
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,730
"To live for you."

587
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,630
"To die for you."

588
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:28,270
"My heart seeks permission
to beat next to yours."

589
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,150
"To live for you."

590
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,000
"To die for you."

591
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:39,640
"I will be by your side as your shadow."

592
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:45,450
"Just give me the permission
to lose myself in you."

593
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,640
I am tired, Karan.

594
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,750
I am tired of these
uncomplete relationships.

595
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:13,640
"From the time I saw you, I have known…"

596
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:19,360
"You are the one I desire."

597
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:30,760
"I have forgotten who I am,
all I remember is you."

598
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:36,420
"Please let me surrender
my heart to you."

599
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:42,180
"My heart seeks permission
to cross all limits."

600
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,990
"To live for you."

601
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,930
"To die for you."

602
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,480
"My heart seeks permission
to beat next to yours."

603
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:56,430
Hey you guys! Stop that!
- "To live for you."

604
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,280
"To die for you."

605
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,880
"I will be by your side as your shadow."

606
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:11,010
"Just give me the permission
to lose myself in you."

607
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,220
I am a little broken

608
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,800
I control my feelings…

609
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,570
before they start controlling me.

610
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,840
I can understand how
strangers feel but

611
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,990
I am unable to share my
feelings with people close to me.

612
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,210
This incomplete girl

613
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,050
who fears to confess her love…

614
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,830
Will you welcome

615
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,290
such a girl into your life?

616
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:53,000
"My heart seeks permission
to beat next to yours."

617
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,700
"To live for you."

618
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,680
"To die for you."

619
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:04,260
"I will be by your side as your shadow."

620
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:10,360
"Just give me the permission
to lose myself in you."

621
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,590
Simran Singh, right?

622
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,890
I am sorry for making you wait.

623
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,870
I was in the school discussing
the syllabus, took a little time.

624
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:46,760
No problem.

625
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,730
I haven't been waiting for long.

626
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,120
Come. Please take a seat.

627
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:50,960
Thank you.

628
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,520
From what I have read about you,
I know that you can help me.

629
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,310
You know quite a lot
about supernatural, right?

630
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,990
No one knows a lot about supernatural.

631
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:07,550
If anyone claims to,
then he or she is lying.

632
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,950
Supernatural itself means
something beyond ones' understanding.

633
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,490
I am a psychic. I get visions.

634
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,850
On the basis of that,
I help me people as much as I can.

635
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,390
Okay, so let’s begin.

636
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,820
From what you told me over
the phone I've learnt that

637
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,080
you wanted to meet
me to seek help for a client.

638
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:32,910
Right?

639
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:34,220
Yes.

640
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,290
Oh, my God!

641
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,480
What?

642
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:52,180
I think I can see something.

643
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,320
A house.

644
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,430
Quite a big house.

645
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,540
No, it's not a house, it's a hotel.

646
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,520
Yes, it is a hotel.

647
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,000
Far away from here, out of the city.

648
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,400
It's name is War
Warrington.

649
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:08,570
Yes.

650
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,700
The hotel's name is The Warrington.

651
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,790
Hi!

652
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,670
Is everything alright?

653
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,620
Do you remember,
I had mentioned a psychic?

654
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,520
I met her.

655
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,770
During the session,
we learnt a hotel's name.

656
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,080
The Warrington.

657
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,280
Then I went there.

658
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,350
After barely managing
to convince the manager

659
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,850
I got access to its CCTV footage

660
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:16,140
of the night when
your wife was murdered.

661
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,910
Let's take a look.

662
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,510
You had said that you
spent the night at Bob's place.

663
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,250
It is not what you think it is.

664
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,330
I can explain this.
- What will you explain, Karan?

665
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,870
What will you explain?

666
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,340
That she too is an evil spirit?

667
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,950
Who after having a
good time in the hotel

668
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,780
went to your house
and murdered your wife?

669
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,450
Is that what you’re going to say?

670
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,130
No, this is me, but…
- Just stop it, Karan.

671
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:04,600
I had told you, you'll suffer
if you'll hide anything from you.

672
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:05,870
But I was wrong.

673
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,340
I am the one who suffered a loss.

674
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,220
My feelings, my trust…
you just…

675
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,550
It would be better if you
take your case to another lawyer.

676
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:19,690
Someone who is as deceitful as you are.

677
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,720
Simran…

678
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,520
Simran…

679
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,410
Wake up, Simran.

680
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,770
I want to talk to you.

681
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,310
Simran, please.

682
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,240
A new clue has come to light in
Mrs. Barkha Khanna's murder case.

683
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:43,430
Mr. Karan Khanna, who was already
in trouble for his wife's murder

684
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:46,140
has now got stuck in
a much bigger scandal now.

685
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,060
As you can see in this clip Mr. Khanna

686
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:53,040
was in Hotel Warrington with another
woman on the night of the murder.

687
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,790
It is obvious that Mr. Khanna
didn’t visit a private hotel

688
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,070
so far away from the
city to discuss politics.

689
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:02,160
Let's talk to our
correspondent Nitin Rawat

690
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,560
who managed to get
hold of this CCTV footage.

691
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,970
As a reporter it is our responsibility

692
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,580
to bring the truth to the people.

693
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,040
Politicians like Karan Khanna
get elected by public votes

694
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:14,360
and then they shy away
from their responsibilities.

695
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,810
So it becomes important
for us to find out the truth.

696
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,610
Mr. Khanna, your lawyer
is late up to a full 15 minutes.

697
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:41,180
Please tell the court if
your lawyer has left the case

698
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:43,290
or if you have appointed
a new lawyer.

699
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,630
Your Honor,
I’m sure she will be on her way…

700
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:46,980
I’m sorry,
Your Honor, I’m so sorry.

701
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,510
The tubes were on strike
and the cab took forever.

702
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,540
I just spin all around town.

703
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:52,740
My apologies.

704
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,540
You're lucky it's an
acceptable excuse, Ms. Singh.

705
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,820
Otherwise, blaming the
traffic is a bit of an old one.

706
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,810
Now, with your permission,
can we start the proceedings?

707
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,980
Yes, Your Honor.
Absolutely.

708
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,380
Simran?

709
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,880
Thank you for coming here today.

710
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:28,990
I'm… I'm very grateful.

711
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,890
I didn’t want to.

712
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,250
But then I thought
if I deceive you now

713
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:39,020
then it makes me just bad as like you.

714
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,340
I had taken the
responsibility to save you.

715
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,730
I am just fulfilling that.

716
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,680
Don’t consider it anymore
than a professional courtesy.

717
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,620
I am ready to accept every accusation,
but just hear me out once.

718
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,760
Just stop with the bullshit, Karan!

719
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,060
You know, what is strange

720
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,400
the body doesn't understand
infidelity but the heart does.

721
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,750
That’s why I’d rather
fuck than fall in love.

722
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,790
The world accuses Simran Singh
of being is an emotional miser!

723
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,720
She doesn't let anyone
close to her heart!

724
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:08,880
Why should I?

725
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:11,060
So that someone can
come and break my heart?

726
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,300
Why should I be emotionally
dependent on anyone

727
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,300
when I know that I'll have
handle my own emotions in the end?

728
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:22,360
Being alone and being lonely
are two different things, Karan.

729
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:28,720
I rather be alone than let
the need someone make feel lonely.

730
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,850
So, thank you for everything,
Mr. Khanna…

731
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,070
But no, thank you.

732
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,210
Is she the same girl
who was with you that night?

733
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,860
Yes

734
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,260
but where did you find this?

735
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,040
And how can she be missing?

736
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:08,210
She had said that…

737
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,020
After I found this,

738
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,180
I went and met Nina.

739
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:17,240
Simran showed me this picture
when she came to meet me.

740
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,820
After that, I started getting visions.

741
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,780
I saw Rachel lying dead.

742
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,230
And somebody,
whose face I could not see

743
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,660
was burying Rachel's
dead body in the forest.

744
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:32,450
There was some Christmas lights
in the background.

745
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,860
She was murdered during Christmas.

746
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:37,900
Two months after that,
on Valentine's day

747
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,960
the hauntings began at your place.

748
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,990
This means…
- She was dead before she met you.

749
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,340
It's time to bring
all the clues together now.

750
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,990
Only then will we find out the truth.

751
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:02,090
That night Bob and I
were attending a fundraiser.

752
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,130
'The fundraiser took
place in Hotel Warrington.'

753
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:09,130
'Bob got busy with some investors.'

754
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,750
'And I was alone in the bar.'

755
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,910
If a handsome candidate
is buying me a drink

756
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,380
does it mean he is
bribing the electorate?

757
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:43,770
No, I think it’s more
like serving the constituent.

758
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:47,590
Oh, it is exactly the
answer I would like to hear.

759
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,470
You sir, have my vote.

760
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:54,670
And you, my lady,
have got yourself a drink.

761
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,150
Arnie, could you get this lady another
round of whatever she is having, please?

762
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:58,990
Sure, sir.

763
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,030
Your finger is bleeding.

764
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,560
You seem to have cut yourself.

765
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,170
Oh, it’s nothing.

766
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,620
Cut my hand, trying to get
that damn can of tonic to open.

767
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,060
You should be careful.

768
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,160
That could get infected.

769
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,280
Perhaps you could make it better.

770
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,590
I’m sorry. I don’t understand.

771
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,040
Not serving the constituent now?

772
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,480
Going to let my poor finger to bleed?

773
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,200
You can keep the kerchief.

774
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:38,540
Enjoy your drink and make
sure you don’t drive home.

775
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:57,420
"It is such beautiful
and mesmerising starlit night…"

776
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:01,950
"How can I let you go?"

777
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:06,720
"Everything is what
it is only because of you."

778
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:15,960
"It is such beautiful
and mesmerising starlit night…"

779
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:20,340
"How can I let you go?"

780
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:25,230
"Everything is what
it is only because of you."

781
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:53,780
"Let all the secrets
stay hidden in the creases."

782
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:03,750
"Let the moments flow so
that you can feel the closeness."

783
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:09,140
"The same story reiterates."

784
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:13,820
"The feelings are the same as well."

785
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:17,910
"How can I let you go?"

786
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:22,770
"Everything is what
it is only because of you."

787
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:51,530
"The weather is conspiring against us."

788
01:09:52,100 --> 01:10:00,780
"Slowly our desires come to life."

789
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:06,360
"You are the one who
adds fragrance to the night."

790
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:11,280
"You are the one who
makes the rains happen."

791
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,570
"How can I let you go?"

792
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:20,380
"Everything is what
it is only because of you."

793
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:23,770
'I was with Rachel the
night Barkha was murdered.'

794
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:27,340
'But I couldn’t tell this to anyone.'

795
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:30,840
'That's why at Bob's advice,
we made up a story.'

796
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,410
'But the truth is that
there are many things'

797
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,920
'about that night
that I don’t even remember.'

798
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,480
'How did I end up in that hotel room?'

799
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:40,260
'When did I leave from there?'

800
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,410
'Nothing.'

801
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,680
'When I came home, I found Barkha dead.'

802
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,640
Possession.

803
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,430
It’s a case of possession.

804
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,230
What?

805
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:57,980
How?

806
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:05,570
Spirits can possess bodies because
that's how body and souls are related.

807
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:07,560
This is what happened to dead Rachel.

808
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,070
An evil spirit possessed her body.

809
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,320
And it used her to get to Karan.

810
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:17,290
Then the same spirit possessed Karan

811
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,750
and used him to murder Barkha.

812
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,890
Karan was possessed when
he came back home at two that night.

813
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,780
He was also possessed when
he left at four after murdering Barkha.

814
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,540
That is why he doesn’t
remember anything.

815
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,310
This is a very nasty spirit.

816
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:41,610
That's why it took you to
that hotel room and did all that

817
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,820
so that everyone thinks
that you were having an affair

818
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,170
and that's why you killed your wife.

819
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,170
It gave you a motive to murder.

820
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:55,760
But I don’t understand,
who would want to do this to me?

821
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,880
By killing my wife,
by trapping me like this…

822
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:07,850
Why would anyone want
to prove that I am a murderer?

823
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:14,760
Simran!

824
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:17,550
Nina!

825
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:19,850
Simran!

826
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:22,440
Simran!

827
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,650
Simran!

828
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:35,910
Simran!

829
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,070
I’m so sorry, Nina.

830
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,890
You too got targeted
by this ghost because of me.

831
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,290
No.

832
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,440
You saved me.

833
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,720
Very evil spirit.

834
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,370
Locket…

835
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,200
Locket…

836
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:43,660
Sorry miss, this is a crime scene,
I can’t let anyone in around here.

837
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,630
I’m sorry.

838
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,700
It all began with the locket.

839
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,680
Locket is the secret.

840
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,640
Where have you kept that locket?

841
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:04,860
Do you recognise him?

842
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:07,170
Have you ever seen him?

843
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,610
Who is it?

844
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,810
Er thank you.

845
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:19,560
Yes, he is the one who
had brought the gift for Barkha.

846
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,230
Are you sure?

847
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,370
Yeah, I'm sure.

848
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,750
But where did you meet him?

849
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,080
What's wrong, dad?

850
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,980
Your mood seems off today.

851
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,980
All okay at the institute?

852
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,930
There is a case…

853
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:47,380
Of a girl.

854
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:50,590
It's quite a different case.

855
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,780
It has been troubling me, dear.

856
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,250
This girl makes me question
all my psychiatric knowledge.

857
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:02,310
Can’t understand.

858
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:05,290
Dad, why don’t you leave
your job at the mental asylum?

859
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,380
I don’t understand.
You have years of experience.

860
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,190
You can get a job anywhere you want.

861
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,450
In fact,
you can start your own practice.

862
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,770
I really don’t understand
why are you going through all this?

863
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:20,370
If you are done with this interrogation,
can we start ordering?

864
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,840
Of course.

865
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:24,050
Here.

866
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:25,540
A jewellery box?

867
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,050
Wow dad,

868
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:32,770
such a big red heart in your possession
a day before Valentine's day?

869
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,420
What’s going on?

870
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:36,590
It's nothing.

871
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:39,190
Oh come on! Don’t lie,
who is the woman?

872
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,240
It's not mine.

873
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,710
It belongs to someone else.

874
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:53,210
I just need to

875
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,330
deliver it to that person.

876
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,990
It means your dad gave that
locket to Barkha at a patient's request.

877
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:04,140
There is a connection between
Barkha and that patient.

878
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,600
Bob knew it.

879
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:09,560
Perhaps that's why he was
returning from the asylum that night.

880
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:11,670
Yeah, that makes sense.

881
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:14,850
And the next day…

882
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,670
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

883
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:22,520
the mulberry bush,
the mulberry bush.

884
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,040
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

885
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,510
the mulberry bush, the mulberry bush.

886
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,880
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush
- Hey! Hey you! Stop!

887
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,930
the mulberry bush,
the mulberry

888
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:36,320
Yes?

889
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,780
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

890
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,560
the mulberry bush, the mulberry bush.

891
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,610
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

892
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:45,120
the mulberry bush,
the mulberry bush.

893
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,360
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

894
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,910
the mulberry bush,
the mulberry bush.

895
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:52,160
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

896
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,220
the mulberry bush, the mulberry bush.
- Excuse me, who are you!

897
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,360
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

898
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,650
the mulberry bush, the mulberry bush.

899
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,610
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush
- Who are you? What do you want?

900
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,490
What?

901
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,860
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

902
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:06,430
the mulberry bush, the mulberry bush.

903
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:08,060
Hey!
Hey you!

904
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,250
Stop! Stop!

905
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,680
Get down! Get down!

906
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:53,580
Whoa!

907
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,840
Your dad used to write
his studies in his journal?

908
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:09,670
Yes.

909
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:12,390
If he has treated that patient then

910
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,400
he surely must've written
something about her in his journal.

911
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,050
But that journal must be at the asylum

912
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:20,450
which has closed down now.

913
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:25,010
No, he used to often write in
them 'till late in the night at home.

914
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:27,970
So, it is possible that
the journal is at home.

915
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:37,530
Are you okay?

916
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:39,840
I am okay.

917
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:42,910
I just can't find my prescription.

918
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,680
I don’t have anymore pills left.

919
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,800
Why do you have my prescription?

920
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,580
You're trying to save my life.

921
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:29,260
So, it is my duty
to try to save your life.

922
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,580
You know that

923
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,360
I could have another withdrawal
attack if I don’t have them.

924
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,690
Who will fight your
case if that happens?

925
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,210
I don’t care about the case.

926
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:52,700
I cannot risk your life for this case.

927
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:58,630
"We are meant to be together forever."

928
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:05,370
"Even death cannot do us apart."

929
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:11,190
"I have decided to make you mine."

930
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:18,080
"I don’t care how to
world punishes me now."

931
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:23,660
"We are meant to be together forever."

932
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:30,720
"Even death cannot do us apart."

933
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:36,460
"I have decided to make you mine."

934
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:43,340
"I don’t care how to
world punishes me now."

935
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:49,750
"Whenever my destiny is decided"

936
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:55,820
"God will make sure
to make you a part of it."

937
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:01,770
"We are meant to be together forever."

938
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:08,580
"Even death cannot do us apart."

939
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,460
What is the matter, officer?

940
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,020
We have an arrest
warrant for Mr. Khanna.

941
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:02,410
I’m sorry officer,
but I think you’re mistaken.

942
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:03,890
Mr. Khanna is out on bail.

943
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,800
And as matter of fact, I am his lawyer.

944
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,720
This lady is Rachel Bingley.

945
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:13,190
She was last seen on video footage,
with Mr. Khanna.

946
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,990
We have reason to
believe that Mr. Khanna

947
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,510
killed her and left her in the woods.

948
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,340
What!

949
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:19,770
That’s absurd.

950
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:21,990
You cannot arrest him on the basis of…

951
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,850
Please miss

952
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:25,850
we have a warrant from the magistrate.

953
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:28,130
If you want to argue it,
you can go to court.

954
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:33,560
If you don’t come along quietly,
I will charge you for resisting arrest.

955
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,920
Officer, this is not…
- Simran, it’s alright.

956
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,620
I think it would be better
if I go with them for now.

957
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,990
You will have to go
to your dad's house alone.

958
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:46,050
That journal is very important for us.

959
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,280
Let’s go, officer.

960
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:50,250
Please, miss.

961
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,900
'18 January, 2019.'

962
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,780
'I got a very strange case today.'

963
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,790
'Patient's name is Sonia.'

964
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:19,760
'Sonia Mehra.'

965
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,430
Sonia…

966
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,410
Why are you crying, Sonia?

967
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,130
I want my locket.

968
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:38,120
It's quite precious to me.

969
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,920
There are some rules here.

970
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:42,000
You aren't allowed any jewellery here.

971
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,470
I am not crazy, doctor.

972
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,990
I forgot to tell you something.

973
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:56,740
Do you know whom did I meet yesterday?

974
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:00,320
Your "Mrs. Khanna".

975
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,330
You are lying, aren't you?

976
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,940
I'm telling the truth.

977
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,950
Which newspaper are you representing?

978
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:17,930
I am not representing any newspaper.

979
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:20,510
I am Dr. Singh.

980
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:23,540
I have been trying to contact
you since quite some time now.

981
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:26,060
Er yes, Mr. Singh, I got your emails.

982
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:29,330
But you know, it’s election time
and we have been running really busy…

983
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,160
Yes, of course, I understand.

984
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:33,800
That's why I had to resort
to use this press meet to approach you.

985
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:34,510
My apologies.

986
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:36,870
I just need three seconds from you.

987
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:40,570
Actually, Mr. Singh, this
is a really wrong time, otherwise I…

988
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,510
Just three seconds.

989
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:43,710
This…

990
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,870
I wanted to know whether
you recognise this girl.

991
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,330
Do you know her?

992
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,310
Well, no.

993
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:54,930
This is the first time I am seeing her.

994
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:55,860
Who is she?

995
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,740
What do you think, doctor?

996
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,330
You will approach her
about her private affair

997
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:04,770
on a public platform
and she will acknowledge it?

998
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:11,640
Look Sonia, this makes it quite difficult
for me to decide who to believe in.

999
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,550
It's obvious you'll believe her, doctor.

1000
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:16,960
Because I am crazy.

1001
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:19,790
But I do want to believe you.

1002
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,460
Just tell me your story.

1003
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:25,670
How can I believe you
if you won’t tell me anything?

1004
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:31,220
" By teaching me love,".

1005
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:37,350
"won't you turn your back on me?"

1006
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:44,160
"Keep your hand on my heart and say".

1007
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:49,630
"You'll never leave me".

1008
01:27:52,410 --> 01:28:04,470
"If you love someone else,
I will die".

1009
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:07,140
'Everyone thought that
Barkha and I were friends.'

1010
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,560
'But we were more than friends.'

1011
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,130
'A lot more.'

1012
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,130
'Barkha's marriage to her husband Karan
was just a convenient arrangement.'

1013
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,110
'She was in love with me.'

1014
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:22,350
'At least that's what I thought.'

1015
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:24,660
'Elections were closing in.'

1016
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,670
'One day when Barkha left my house'

1017
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:33,050
'I saw Karan's campaign manager
Bob Anand waiting outside for her.'

1018
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:36,750
'Bob had pictures of
Barkha and me together.'

1019
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,350
'He had evidence of our love.'

1020
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:46,000
'Barkha said that Karan has
threatened to embarrass her publicly.'

1021
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,240
'She was very scared.'

1022
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:51,920
'She wanted us to stop
seeing each other for some time.'

1023
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:58,350
'She would leave Karan and
come to me once the elections end.'

1024
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:03,600
'I knew that Barkha
was leaving me and choosing

1025
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,350
Karan's money and power instead.'

1026
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:10,550
'After all,
when she married him for his money'

1027
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:12,990
'so how can she leave him for love?'

1028
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,770
'But I am not the kind of
a girl who gives up so easily.'

1029
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:23,160
'I told Barkha that I'd call a
press conference and expose the truth.'

1030
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:26,060
'I would expose Karan and her.'

1031
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:30,960
'But before I could do that,
the three of them got together'

1032
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,540
'and played a very dirty trick on me.'

1033
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:38,830
'They used their influence and
got me locked up in this mental asylum.'

1034
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,050
'Now who would believe a crazy girl?'

1035
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:46,060
'Even if I tell the truth
at the top of my voice'

1036
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:49,630
'everyone will think that I am lying.'

1037
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:58,510
Sonia, if this is what
has really happened to you

1038
01:29:58,580 --> 01:29:59,790
then it is indeed so wrong.

1039
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:02,240
If you think this is wrong

1040
01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:05,860
then please let me go.

1041
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,240
It is not so easy.

1042
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,700
We cannot let patients just leave.

1043
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:12,330
We need run some tests.

1044
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,940
It will be too late by then.

1045
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:15,340
Too late for what?

1046
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:21,710
Doctor…

1047
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:27,290
I want to kill all three of
them before the elections take place.

1048
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:30,010
I want to murder them.

1049
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,090
Doctor…

1050
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:37,910
Will you let me go or not?

1051
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:42,390
Will you let me go or not?

1052
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:45,390
I want to kill them, doctor.

1053
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:47,770
Please try to understand.

1054
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:52,520
'20th January, 2019.'

1055
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:56,990
'Sonia Mehra has left me
with so many unanswered questions.'

1056
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:02,300
'Is Sonia mentally stable or not?'

1057
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:07,190
'How can a girl who wants
to kill others be of a sound mind?'

1058
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,770
What are you laughing at?

1059
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:19,100
At all of you.

1060
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:19,850
Why?

1061
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:23,090
You want to keep Sonia
confined here, right?

1062
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:24,720
You won't be able it.

1063
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,740
Why won't we able to?

1064
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:29,150
Because she is about to free
herself from all confinements.

1065
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:31,810
Oh, really?

1066
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:33,310
She is my pupil.

1067
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,200
This is the least I
could have done for her.

1068
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:40,630
I told her,
all the restrictions apply to the body.

1069
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,420
Souls are always free.

1070
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,100
If she wants to seek
revenge from her enemies

1071
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,040
then she will have to risk her body.

1072
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:55,790
As the body loses the battle here,
the soul shall triumph there!

1073
01:31:57,790 --> 01:32:00,990
'22nd January, 2019.'

1074
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:04,730
'This is the darkest day of my career.'

1075
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:10,680
'Sonia Mehra seemed quite
calm since the past three days.'

1076
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:16,520
'I had started to believe
that the worst is behind us.'

1077
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:21,850
'But I didn’t know
that I was horribly wrong.'

1078
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:38,800
You?

1079
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,970
This time I haven’t come
here to ask you any questions.

1080
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:45,490
I have only come here
to give you something.

1081
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,230
Er… what is this?

1082
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:49,430
I had a patient, Sonia.

1083
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:53,960
After her death, she wanted…

1084
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,340
You to have this.

1085
01:32:58,510 --> 01:32:59,510
Death?

1086
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:01,060
How?

1087
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:03,660
Who is it?

1088
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,640
Er… thank you.

1089
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:17,640
My God, this is unbelievable.

1090
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,180
It's extraordinary.

1091
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,560
We need to find a way out of this.

1092
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,210
Sonia is taking her revenge.

1093
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:32,080
Barkha, Bob and now Karan.

1094
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:35,980
We'll need to get Karan out
of prison in order to save his life.

1095
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,060
Anyhow.

1096
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:40,090
We have no way to save
him while he is in prison.

1097
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,390
Believe me, Simran.

1098
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,720
Neither did I know
about Barkha and Sonia

1099
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,450
nor did I have any
involvement in separating them.

1100
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:06,770
Bob did this to save my campaign.

1101
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:07,900
I know.

1102
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:11,140
Barkha didn’t want
Sonia to approach you.

1103
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:15,130
That's why she lied
that you know everything.

1104
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:17,540
Now I am being accused of two murders.

1105
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:22,120
What I thought would be
a few years of imprisonment

1106
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:25,700
has now changed into
lifetime imprisonment.

1107
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,450
Or even a death sentence.

1108
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:33,320
Nothing can happen to you
as long as I am here, Karan.

1109
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:35,250
Don’t you trust me?

1110
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:37,500
You are the only one I trust.

1111
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:40,080
A lie is a lie.

1112
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,280
It doesn't matter whether
there is a human or a ghost involved.

1113
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:47,170
We will have to expose the
lie using the power of the truth.

1114
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,380
What do you mean?

1115
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,960
I mean we have no other option left now.

1116
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:56,420
We will have to tell
the court about Sonia.

1117
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,120
Simran

1118
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,710
I know you've asked me
not to say anything personal…

1119
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:15,530
But I think it is important
to say this today.

1120
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:18,950
I love you.

1121
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:21,480
Perhaps, even more than I did before.

1122
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:25,270
Please, don’t fight that spirit.

1123
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,010
Someone who hates me
so unabashedly and intensely

1124
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:34,510
can only be defeated by someone who loves
me just as unabashedly and intensely.

1125
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:37,500
And you perhaps don't.

1126
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,530
I don’t want you to
risk your life for me.

1127
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:47,750
Simran, have you starting doing drugs?

1128
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,270
This is so absurd!

1129
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:52,100
No judge would give such a ruling.

1130
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:54,280
Law doesn't permit that.

1131
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:55,590
I know, Sid.

1132
01:35:56,130 --> 01:35:57,590
That's why I have come to you.

1133
01:35:57,770 --> 01:35:59,590
I have gone through
every feasible option

1134
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:03,210
nothing except for the
truth can prove Karan's innocence.

1135
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:04,880
What do you want from me?

1136
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:07,900
Spirit possession is
a well-documented theory.

1137
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:11,730
And in many countries,
Church has openly accepted it.

1138
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,030
It is also mentioned in the Bible.

1139
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:18,570
We will attempt to prove
spirit possession in the court.

1140
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,290
And how will you prove that?

1141
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:22,470
Hmm?

1142
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,170
You will perhaps need to
send a summons to the spirit.

1143
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:25,480
Something like that.

1144
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,470
I am sorry

1145
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,360
I cannot be a part of this craziness.

1146
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:31,720
Oh, come on Sid!

1147
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:34,850
It is possible if you talk to the judge.

1148
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:36,550
After all, you're a judge too.

1149
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:38,680
And we are not asking
anyone to change the law.

1150
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:40,870
We are just seeking permission
to show everyone the truth.

1151
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:44,240
Can't law do even this
much to save an innocent person?

1152
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:48,680
You are in love with him, aren't you?

1153
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,200
That's why you are doing all this.

1154
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:17,910
Did you get the pill?

1155
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:18,970
Yes, ma’am.

1156
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:20,920
But with great difficulty.
That too just one.

1157
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:24,220
I guess I will save this one for later.

1158
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:24,990
Hmm.

1159
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:28,460
It’s Sid.

1160
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:29,510
Hmm.

1161
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:31,270
Hello?

1162
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:32,670
You have the permission.

1163
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:34,720
Thank you.

1164
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:36,310
Thank you so much, Sid.

1165
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,900
I shall never forget this favour.

1166
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:41,760
Don’t get too excited.
Hear me out first.

1167
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:43,420
Judge has two conditions.

1168
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:44,350
Go ahead.

1169
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:45,600
Apart from the video cameras

1170
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:48,330
you'll also need to keep
two court approved witnesses with you.

1171
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:49,800
That’s fine.

1172
01:37:49,950 --> 01:37:52,450
And, you can get the dead
body from the medical college

1173
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:54,960
but your client will
have to bear its expenses.

1174
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,780
Of course.

1175
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:57,840
Good. All the best.

1176
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:02,200
It's done.

1177
01:38:41,810 --> 01:38:44,460
This is the room in which
Sonia Mehra killed herself.

1178
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:48,010
Today, we will attempt to bring
her soul back into this cadaver

1179
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:50,710
and prove
that possession does exist.

1180
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,740
Oh, my God!

1181
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,050
What…

1182
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:11,640
Simran!

1183
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,520
Oh, my God!

1184
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,040
Oh, my God!

1185
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:24,550
Nina!

1186
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:25,650
Nina!

1187
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,730
Take her to the hospital now.

1188
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:33,400
I need to get back
in there to get the proof.

1189
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:34,770
Yes, absolutely.

1190
01:43:58,830 --> 01:44:00,700
'This is ridiculous!'

1191
01:44:01,630 --> 01:44:04,560
'Someone should have
informed me right away.'

1192
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,910
'Was there no one there in the mess?'

1193
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:09,950
'My God!
– Sorry, sir.'

1194
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:13,470
'Have you called the other doctors?
– Yeah.'

1195
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:15,280
'I need an ambulance right now!'

1196
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:17,540
'And get me the OR just in case.
– Sure, sir. Right away.'

1197
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:18,130
Papa?

1198
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,740
'Have you checked on her medicines?'

1199
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:23,030
'Are you sure, she hasn’t taken
something she was not supposed to take?'

1200
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:24,250
'We're sure, sir.'

1201
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,680
'Are you doubly sure?
– Yes, sir.'

1202
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,450
Yasmine, can you hear me?

1203
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:32,420
Yasmine!

1204
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,920
This is for confining Sonia here!

1205
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,240
You are the only one I needed to kill.

1206
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,910
Sonia's spirit will kill all others.

1207
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:43,700
You made a mistake
by giving her the pendant!

1208
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:46,910
That is Sonia's house.
You sent it to her home!

1209
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,280
Papa!

1210
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,380
'Please, don’t fight that spirit.'

1211
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:44,600
'Someone who hates me
so unabashedly and intensely'

1212
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:47,630
'can only be defeated by someone'

1213
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:49,540
'who loves me just as
unabashedly and intensely.'

1214
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:52,610
'And you perhaps don't.'

1215
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:05,700
I love you.

1216
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:11,460
"We are meant to be together forever."
- I love you, Karan.

1217
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:18,210
"Even death cannot do us apart."

1218
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:24,090
"I have decided to make you mine."

1219
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:30,930
"I don’t care how to
world punishes me now."

1220
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:36,580
"We are meant to be together forever."

1221
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:43,440
"Even death cannot do us apart."

1222
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:49,380
"I have decided to make you mine."

1223
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:56,280
"I don’t care how to
world punishes me now."

1224
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:12,350
Here we go 'round
the Mulberry bush

1225
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,320
the mulberry bush,
the mulberry bush.

1226
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:22,620
Here we go 'round the Mulberry bush

1227
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:27,690
the mulberry bush,
the mulberry bush.

1228
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:33,390
Here we go 'round
the Mulberry bush

1229
01:52:09,330 --> 01:52:14,490
'Inmates of Cell B,
C, D who are not engaged in any work'

1230
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,440
'are ordered to assemble
in the assembly area.'

1231
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,220
Karan! Karan!

1232
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:07,840
'It all began with the locket.'

1233
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:12,140
'Locket is the secret.'

1234
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,630
This is extra ordinary!

1235
01:56:02,830 --> 01:56:03,940
Truly!

1236
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:06,020
Mr. Douglas?

1237
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,460
We would have to cut a deal

1238
01:56:10,890 --> 01:56:14,240
and the public can
never know this kind of truth.

1239
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,230
We simply cannot.

1240
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:19,330
Miss Simran?

1241
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:20,460
I agree

1242
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:23,830
as long as the world knows that Mr.
Karan Khanna is innocent.

1243
01:56:27,070 --> 01:56:30,400
'Now let's come to the most
controversial story of this year.'

1244
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:31,700
'Mr. Karan Khanna.'

1245
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:35,090
'He was accused of killing
his wife and his girlfriend'

1246
01:56:35,170 --> 01:56:37,440
'but the court relieved
him from all charges.'

1247
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:43,190
'This strange case goes down into the
history of law as justice delivered.'

1248
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,740
'And now for the election results.'

1249
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:50,150
'Mr. Gerard Murphy from the
Conservative party gets 3000 votes.'

1250
01:56:50,490 --> 01:56:54,330
'Ms. Kristine Southern from
the Labor party gets 3200 votes.'

1251
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,850
'And on the number
one position we have'

1252
01:56:56,930 --> 01:57:00,610
'an independent candidate
who wins with more than 20,000'

1253
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,110
Mr. Karan Khanna!

1254
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:06,230
Thank you!

1255
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,820
Thank you so much!
Thank you!

1256
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:19,260
You won!

1257
01:57:21,330 --> 01:57:22,530
We won!

1258
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:26,550
I saved you from hatred

1259
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,730
and you taught me how to love.

1260
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,550
Oh, really?

1261
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:33,120
Prove it.

1262
01:57:35,770 --> 01:57:36,860
I love you.

1263
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:38,250
Say it again.

1264
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,120
Please?

1265
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:41,250
Go be an MP!

1266
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:45,850
Well done! Congratulations!
- Thank you!

1267
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:47,490
This is for you.
- Thanks.

1268
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:51,960
Thank you.
