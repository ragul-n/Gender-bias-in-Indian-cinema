1
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:18,183
Eggs are available easily.

2
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:20,258
Eat eggs you get strength
and hatch it, you get chicks.

3
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,189
But eggs get bad name because of eggs.

4
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:24,193
Male is called as man and
female is called as woman,

5
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:26,764
But a eunuch is called as .5!

6
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,924
Greens and vegetables are called
as vegetarian,

7
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:30,899
mutton, fishes are called
as non-vegetarian.

8
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:33,198
But egg is called as .5!

9
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:37,275
Reason is like Sachin didn't get awarded
with Bharat Ratna till he hit 100 centuries,

10
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:41,937
a man who never ate egg is life gave an award
to egg that it is most powerful vegetarian.

11
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:44,879
Using his name many consider it
as vegetarian and eating eggs.

12
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:48,384
But few people avoid eating eggs
calling it as non-vegetarian.

13
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:50,319
So, egg was left without any decision.

14
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:53,726
Taking the same as an example,
if you give it to a boy,

15
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,191
l don't know if it is right or wrong,

16
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:56,795
he'll make an omelette
of egg and eat it.

17
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:58,494
lf you give the same to a girl...

18
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,223
Shall l make omelette or fried rice?

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,391
Shall l apply yellow to face
and white to hair?

20
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:05,163
Shall l hatch it or throw it some
boy's face to fool him?

21
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:07,933
She'll throw the egg on ground
with such ideas.

22
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:10,633
Eggs becomes omelette only if it is broken
or become chick only if it hatches.

23
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,245
But throwing like this would
make it go waste.

24
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:19,750
Let's begin our story with body of Goraju
who got cheated by a girl in the name of love.

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,958
Tell me.

26
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:29,254
Where are you?
- l told you, right?

27
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:31,420
My friend is dead.
l'll get late.

28
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:32,758
Tell father about this.

29
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,491
Cremation would be over by 6 pm, right

30
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,762
But it's my best friend who died!

31
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:39,169
Shouldn't l at least have 2 pegs?

32
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,509
He's Sai, Suresh's best friend.

33
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,612
Don't feel sad.

34
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:52,612
Girls are like this, uncle.

35
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:56,320
They use beautiful flowers and dot
but their hearts not that beautiful.

36
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,716
But if they find a good boy like him,
they don't rest till they kill him.

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,492
Look at them!

38
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:05,529
They're angry for commenting on girls
than sad about brother's death.

39
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,299
They're great cheats!

40
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,630
Don't worry, leave it.
- Leave me, uncle.

41
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:13,997
We got sense with this incident.

42
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:16,672
We swear on the dead body of our friend.

43
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,879
From today we'll not go after girls.

44
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:23,243
We'll not send requests for new girls.

45
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:25,874
We'll not hit likes for new posts.

46
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:30,352
We'll marry the girl our parents
select for us.

47
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:33,048
We'll consider their happiness as ours.

48
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,217
We'll never ever go after any girl.

49
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:41,028
Ogling at girls,
it's no more in our chapter.

50
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,168
Not even in twitter.

51
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:45,862
Lord Rama is ultimate truth!

52
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:52,628
lf the girl is like a Goddess,
won't every boy become a priest?

53
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:57,573
Won't festivals like Dussera, Diwali
and Sankranthi come at a time?

54
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,687
lt seems every word is like
a bullet fired from gun...

55
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:21,425
lt seems every smile is like
ring of temple bell...

56
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:26,300
Why do we need cool breeze when
their sari end breezes past us?

57
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:31,103
lt seems their beauty is like getting
possessed by Goddess Mother...

58
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:35,839
lt seems their kiss shattering
like earth quake...

59
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:40,544
lf we've a woman as companion,
why do we need this world?

60
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,033
Girl came into the dream...
Girl came to the temple...

61
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:57,897
Girl came into our lap...

62
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:21,360
Heart is open like switching
on Bluetooth on seeing a girl...

63
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:23,928
New feelings take over us...

64
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:28,329
Like GPS is activated,
we follow you as destination...

65
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:31,061
We cross districts...

66
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:35,936
They're the screensavers in both eyes...

67
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:40,512
They're the wallpaper in our
little hearts...

68
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,946
Without your beautiful faces,
everything is dull and bland...

69
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:18,745
Girls have features which even
ice creams can't boast of..

70
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:21,512
They create chaos in our minds...

71
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:25,852
Girls lips are more intoxicating
than liquor...

72
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:28,721
They entice you to bite it...

73
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:33,559
Their eyes are twin cameras...

74
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:37,965
They flash at us constantly...

75
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:41,904
We'll do anything for girls...

76
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,180
What's this?

77
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,349
3Just now you swore,
you talked about mother and father...

78
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,079
You said you don't know who girls are!

79
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:57,814
You're going after girls with dead body.

80
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:02,325
Mustn't go after girls but
if you see such a girl, don't leave her.

81
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,588
Angel...she's an angel, uncle.

82
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:07,265
Face is divine, uncle.

83
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,059
lf l leave l may not get her again.

84
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:11,669
What's this talk about love with corpse
and in burial ground?

85
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:15,932
Uncle, mausoleum is the symbol of love.
Taj Mahal!

86
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:19,038
For the present,
this is our hero's Taj Mahal.

87
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:23,382
House number and members of this
house have a close relationship.

88
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,374
All members in this house are number one.

89
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:29,147
For all the members to be number
and door number also to be one,

90
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:32,386
the man behind this is city planning
commissioner Sarvesh Anand Rao.

91
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,854
Head of this family and
a fan of joint family.

92
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,070
Did you see? She's Anand Rao's
wife Amaravathi.

93
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:49,606
Giving birth to three lovely children,
following husband's orders in letter and spirit,

94
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:52,006
a chaste housewife who doesn't
even watch TV soaps.

95
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,243
lf day has to be good after coffee,
Anand Rao believes it needs good planning.

96
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:00,952
When he had a son after a year
of marriage,

97
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,587
he named him as Sudhir,

98
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:05,054
planned in which school he must study
from LKG to tenth class,

99
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,591
and in which college he must study
from inter to MBA,

100
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:10,423
must work in which bank and
where to find his bride,

101
00:09:10,597 --> 00:09:12,656
if they have a son,
he must be named as Pravin,

102
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:15,062
he planned this before and
did as he had planned.

103
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:16,497
Two years after marriage,

104
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:18,432
Santhosh was born as Anand Rao's
second son,

105
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:22,006
as planned he made him a doctor
and got him married too,

106
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:25,372
if they have a boy or girl,
he has a name for them also,

107
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:26,534
he's awaiting for it to happen.

108
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,245
After 3 years of marriage,

109
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:32,510
Amaravathi gave birth to a beautiful daughter
and presented her to Anand Rao.

110
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:35,279
Considering her as Goddess Lakshmi herself,

111
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:38,947
he named as her Lakshmi Anand,

112
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,227
he planned that she'll become
an engineer,

113
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,726
raising her well and
giving her good education,

114
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,158
he made her a software engineer,

115
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,629
he planned her starting salary
must be Rs.25000.

116
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,925
But he rejected when Rs.10000 was offered.

117
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,965
Rejected Rs.20000 also.

118
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,435
He rejected when Rs.45000 was offered.

119
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:56,905
l'm getting more salary, right?
You're happy. right?

120
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:00,705
Look dear, we must fight for the life
we had decided.

121
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,144
Only then our life will be in our hands.

122
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:05,443
lf we change our decision for better offer,
our path will take wrong turn,

123
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:08,109
our life will go into other's hands.

124
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:10,222
We can't choose how we should be born.

125
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,952
But if decide how to grow and
what to become, we'll surely be like that.

126
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:17,062
Wait till you get what your aim was!

127
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:23,459
Anand Rao settled Lakshmi's engagement
with a software engineer boy.

128
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:27,572
Sent them by promising to fix auspicious
date for marriage in near future.

129
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:32,575
You see, when family gets together,
it's a temple.

130
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,904
But when it is silent, it is library.

131
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:36,748
Library brings to my memory,

132
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,679
the first rule of Anand Rao to the family,

133
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:43,016
any member of family has to sign in,
out time and details in the register.

134
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:46,454
Every one including guests and servants.

135
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,020
Not just building bodies without fat
or buying things without vat,

136
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:51,686
it's perfect to lead a family.

137
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,301
Running a well disciplined family,
Anand Rao believes in it,

138
00:10:55,468 --> 00:11:01,998
so many people are saluting with respect,
that's because how he leads his family.

139
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,939
This is Lakshmi's office.

140
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:07,479
She's Lakshmi's boss who pays her.

141
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,538
All these people are Lakshmi's colleagues.

142
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,246
But she's Lakshmi's best friend.

143
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,444
Her name is Pavithra and
she's from Sangamithra.

144
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,048
Your would be on phone.

145
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:19,521
Tell him l'm busy with work.

146
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:22,126
Connect it to my desk.

147
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,990
No, please...

148
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:27,257
You'll talk to him now and
we'll listen to it.

149
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:36,566
Can you please wait for some time?
l'll call you after reaching home.

150
00:11:36,743 --> 00:11:38,973
No, l want to talk to you now.

151
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:40,403
Tell me.

152
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,413
l like love marriage so much.

153
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,582
Now that we're engaged, right?

154
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:49,187
lt's not possible now, right?
But l've an idea.

155
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:51,516
Today is Valentine's day, right?

156
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,284
How about meeting today?

157
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,825
Ours too would become love marriage.

158
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,520
l won't do anything without
informing my dad.

159
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,256
l can't meet you.

160
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,164
Who told you not to inform your dad?

161
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:04,997
Tell him and come.
- No, dad is in Delhi.

162
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,502
Phone is switched off.

163
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:09,905
Are you mad?

164
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,407
You've to spend rest of all
your life with him.

165
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:14,307
That's his first wish.

166
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,348
lf you don't go,
he'll have this feeling all his life.

167
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:23,884
1Are we meeting, Lakshmi?

168
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:27,549
l'm not Lakshmi, l'm her friend Pavithra.

169
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:30,921
Wait in Coffee Day in MBP colony.
She'll come.

170
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,762
Try to understand me.

171
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:39,666
Won't you leave me?

172
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:42,135
Go!

173
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:43,807
What's this?

174
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,241
Hero is searching Lakshmi deeper than
Google and higher than eagle.

175
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,714
But he didn't find her yet.

176
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:57,546
Like an lndian fan watching with interest
even if 60 runs have to be scored in one ball.

177
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:00,658
He's watching with great hope
in the city's last college.

178
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:01,987
For his dream girl

179
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,333
What's the problem?
- Ran out of petrol.

180
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:43,992
No petrol bunk nearby too.

181
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,198
One minute.

182
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,920
Enough! lt's overflowing!

183
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:02,707
She's going away!

184
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,191
What happened?
- Ran out of petrol.

185
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,020
lf you give donate everything,
won't your bike go dry?

186
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:16,292
How?

187
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:20,256
Get it.

188
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:24,031
Ride the bike.

189
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,271
Hi madam....Hi sir!

190
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:37,780
We belong to Jai Bajrang Dal.

191
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,281
You both are lovers, right?

192
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:44,045
His bike went dry and l'm taking him
to the nearest petrol bunk.

193
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:45,884
See, he's carrying a bottle
in his mouth.

194
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:48,390
Any carrying an empty bottle
is going to petrol bunk,

195
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:50,995
anyone carrying a basket ball
is going to Olympics,

196
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,062
we're not so foolish to believe
all this crap.

197
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:55,063
Give me sacred thread.
- Take it.

198
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,292
Why don't you talk to them?

199
00:15:57,603 --> 00:15:59,070
What's the proof that we're lovers?

200
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,865
Tie the knot with him now.

201
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,508
Prove that we're lovers,
l'll marry him happily.

202
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,803
Should we conduct a blood test now?
- l think so.

203
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,343
Okay, as you say.

204
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:10,971
What's your name?
- Lakshmi Anand.

205
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:13,244
Boy...dear....what's your name?

206
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:16,115
Tell me, dear?
- Tell your name. He's asking you.

207
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:18,151
Why are you pushing him?

208
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:20,689
Society is like that, l'll ask him.

209
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,351
Boy. . .dear...what's your name?

210
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:27,159
What's your name, dear?

211
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:32,661
Dear, give me that bouquet.

212
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,475
lt means you both are not lovers.

213
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,042
Just helpers.

214
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,041
lf you've any garden, shove it on my ears.

215
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:44,342
Even if it is heavy, l'll carry it.

216
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:45,142
Tie the knot.

217
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,784
Come...come dear...

218
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,786
Tie...tie...tie...

219
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:54,188
Tie it!

220
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:02,397
Please trust me.

221
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,033
No!

222
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:10,165
Please, l beg you.
- Why are you delaying it?

223
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:12,903
Come uncle, at least you're here
for my marriage.

224
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,569
He said uncle,
but l don't see anyone here.

225
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:18,644
Brother, he's running away with
sacred thread.

226
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:21,514
Hey you, stop!
- Run...run...catch him.

227
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,054
Stop...stop...stop...

228
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:37,968
Got tensed?

229
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:39,933
l'm there, right?

230
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:41,095
Are you Sathya?

231
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:43,034
Are you Sathya?

232
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,507
l mean my grandfather's grandfather's
name was Sathyanarayanmurthy.

233
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,374
My grandfather was named as
Sathyanarayana without Murthy.

234
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,515
l was named as Sathya without Narayana.

235
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,014
That's why my name is Sathya.

236
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:56,018
Sai, you left the bike with keys.
What if anyone steals?

237
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:57,883
My name is Sai Sathya...

238
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,521
You've been slapping me all the day,
stop it now.

239
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,426
Either l've to slap you or slap myself.

240
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,033
Time now is 10.45 pm,
no petrol in the bike.

241
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:11,192
No time to walk home,
leave me now, please.

242
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,361
You've a friend Veerasamy in
some wine shop, call him.

243
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:16,269
ls Veerasamy my brother-in-law to give
money or liquor whenever l ask?

244
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,133
Come quickly.
- Tell me, Rambabu.

245
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,870
l need liquor,
wait, l'll be there in 20 minutes.

246
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:24,538
l'm shutting the shop in 10 minutes.
Police are creating too many problems.

247
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:25,706
Will you be open for 10 minutes?

248
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:29,286
He says he'll be open for 10 minutes only,
how to reach the shop?

249
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:30,816
We've our regular plan, right?

250
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,390
Stop...stop...stop...

251
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:49,006
What happened?
- My friend Rambabu.

252
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,109
He has fallen down,
l need to take him to hospital.

253
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:51,902
What happened?

254
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:53,601
He hurt his brain long back but
since life is more important,

255
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,576
he's living dangerously, sir.

256
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,306
Don't know why but he fell down.
- Get him quickly.

257
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,912
Boy, we found a scapegoat,
manage properly.

258
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:02,916
Slowly....carefully...

259
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,579
Quick...please...

260
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:06,918
Close the door properly.

261
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:09,852
Careful...careful...

262
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,123
Go quickly, shop may get closed.
- Shop?

263
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:16,033
We've to go to hospital, right?
lt's open 24 hours, right?

264
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:19,103
Hospital will be there but l fear
medical shop next to it may close.

265
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,102
We'll reach.

266
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:24,841
Come quickly, police are here.

267
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,942
lf you get late, l'll close the shop.

268
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:27,043
Don't do it, we'll be there in 2 minutes.

269
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,771
Who is it?
- Medical shop man.

270
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:30,108
ls he threatening to close?
- Yes, sir.

271
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:31,715
Give the phone to me,
l'll talk to him.

272
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:33,042
Give me.

273
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,448
We'll be there in 2 minutes,
don't close the shop.

274
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:40,592
Don't take it as business,
take it as help.

275
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,748
We'll be there in 2 minutes.

276
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:42,951
Come quickly.

277
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,859
l liked your dialogue that it's not
business but help.

278
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,364
Can l use it elsewhere, sir?

279
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,801
This left...this left, sir.

280
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:54,564
Here?
- Here! Stop here, sir.

281
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,368
Where's the hospital here?
- Here only, sir.

282
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,108
Where's the hospital here?

283
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:05,347
You're a pain in neck! Craps!

284
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:08,782
We're your regular customers,
you've to bear it with us.

285
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:09,978
Coming late?

286
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:16,589
Aren't you ashamed to lie for lift
to spoil your health?

287
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:20,323
Government is bottling and selling it openly.

288
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:24,094
We're drinking it to help govt.
pay salaries to its employees.

289
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,669
Why should we be ashamed off!

290
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:30,604
Though l can't your face properly
in darkness, l hate to see you.

291
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,869
Though l can see you,
l too hate to see you. Get lost!

292
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,012
Go to hell!

293
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:37,676
Why is he going away?
- Uncle is hurt deeply.

294
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,112
lf he had waited,
he would've dropped us home.

295
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,048
Had we asked, he would've run over
the car on us.

296
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:46,347
Take it.

297
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,520
While pouring peg, don't be stingy.

298
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:52,390
Karna of Mahabharata says we must
be generous while giving others.

299
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:54,361
Must be stingy while taking
for ourselves.

300
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:56,023
Remember that.
- ls it?

301
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:57,300
You make the drink.

302
00:20:57,436 --> 00:20:59,404
Then, do it.
- Bloody philosophy and bloody you!

303
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:00,599
Enough.

304
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:07,308
We'll arrest for drinking outside the bar,
you're having drinks in open place.

305
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:09,141
Come to the station with me.

306
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,146
People drink on main centre in Mexico.

307
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:18,051
French drink near the factories.

308
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:19,781
People drink near wine shops in Bangkok.

309
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,393
But in lndia wherever one may drink,
people ask, why are you drinking here?

310
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,051
Won't you allow lndia to develop?

311
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:27,392
Though what you say is nonsense,
l like your concept.

312
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:28,828
Developing lndia.

313
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:35,237
l too wish to develop lndia.

314
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:38,901
Yesterday morning a girl appeared
and hit my heart.

315
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:42,741
The same girl appeared today slapped
and spat on my face.

316
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,645
Because of this crook.
- l got you a full bottle for it.

317
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:48,342
What am l to do to impress her, Guru?

318
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:51,615
lmpress makes me remember,
when l was young...

319
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,758
There used to be a girl in my street.

320
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:54,858
Studying in the same institute.

321
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:57,695
l tried a lot to impress her.

322
00:21:57,896 --> 00:22:00,592
She used to fight hard to pass
the subjects she failed in inter.

323
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:03,291
l was very speed like a horse.

324
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:05,300
She was very slow like a tortoise.

325
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:08,998
The tortoise girl tied to catch
a rabbit once,

326
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:11,938
but she couldn't.
She left in despair.

327
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:15,939
With an ulterior motive to impress her,
l rang her door bell.

328
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:17,173
She opened the door.

329
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:19,317
l opened the bag and kept it in her hands.

330
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:22,079
She gave a loud shriek and threw it away.

331
00:22:22,254 --> 00:22:25,280
She slapped and threw me out!

332
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:31,124
Why?

333
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:33,992
lt seems she wanted to raise the rabbit.

334
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:37,134
l got it grilled thinking
she'd like to eat.

335
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:45,533
Reached my home!

336
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,744
Why is it locked?

337
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,246
Mother, l'm coming.

338
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,145
What have you done, mom?

339
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:00,552
Why are you climbing the gate?

340
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:04,421
Gate is locked, right?
- lt's open.

341
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,566
Careful, son.

342
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,262
Are you drunk?

343
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,067
Couldn't avoid it.

344
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:19,174
What's this, son? lf your dad knows,
he'll rip our your skin.

345
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:23,439
Can he bear the truth that his grown up
son has come home drunk?

346
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:24,571
ls dad in home?

347
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:27,843
We both are very lucky,
he hasn't come home yet.

348
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,550
Okay, come and have dinner.

349
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:31,415
l had.

350
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:33,457
At least chew betel nut and go to bed.

351
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:34,889
He'll sleep next to you.

352
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,204
Betel nuts won't be in fridge.

353
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:51,333
Are you drunk?

354
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:58,447
Do you know how our son would be
hurt if he knows you're drunk?

355
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:03,218
Can that little boy bear the shock
that his father is a drunkard?

356
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,147
ls he in home?

357
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:07,258
He came home at 7 pm,
had food and went to bed.

358
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:12,096
Then, l'll go to bed.
- Food?

359
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:15,832
You've to sleep next to him,
chew betel nuts and go to bed.

360
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:17,263
You're right!

361
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,469
Betel nuts won't be there in fridge.

362
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:30,844
Take it.

363
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:37,649
Go to bed.

364
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:43,758
l'm managing well,
if not this house would become a hell.

365
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:01,636
Come here.
- Greetings, sir.

366
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,347
Greetings, sir, Are you fine, sir?
- Greetings, fine.

367
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:05,346
Your daughter?
- Yes, sir.

368
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:06,779
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, dear.

369
00:25:06,952 --> 00:25:08,146
Pay for the vegetables.

370
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,151
You said you're looking searching
groom for her, any progress?

371
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:16,227
We spent our lives with cap,
l'm searching for a son-in-law with cap, sir.

372
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:18,693
Even pen has a cap, marry her off to it.

373
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:20,157
What else then?

374
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:24,267
Don't worry about whether he's
wearing cap or carrying laptop,

375
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:27,963
check if he'll look after your
daughter well or not.

376
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:34,671
Coming...coming...

377
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:35,472
Greetings, madam.

378
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:36,875
Look how her hand is hurt.

379
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:37,674
What happened?

380
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,477
First apply ointment.
- What happened?

381
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,484
You asked that thrice,
first give her first aid.

382
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:44,881
How did you get hurt, dear?

383
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,551
Leave her hand.

384
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:53,664
lf you behave like this with family of police,
what about others?

385
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:57,661
l'll kill you...
if l see you again in this area.

386
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,000
Won't daughters of police get married
or get husbands or go to honeymoon?

387
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:05,173
What the hell are you blabbering?
Come with me.

388
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:09,210
How dare you hold my shirt collar!

389
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:12,282
How dare you hold the collar
of a police officer!

390
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:13,581
Hands off me.

391
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:14,477
Hands off me.

392
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,293
Where are you going?

393
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,772
To find whether your tailor stitched your shirt
properly or the man who held it grew up well.

394
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:40,077
Search for umbrella means
rainy season is here.

395
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:42,645
lf you go in search of trouble it means
your bad days are near.

396
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:45,909
His sins will take its toll,
get the water heater l gave for repair.

397
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:47,745
l must take bath and go to duty.

398
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:07,963
Shop is closed.

399
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,332
Call your father.

400
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:10,099
Get down.

401
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:12,771
Dad, shop is closed.

402
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:15,209
He has kept it under the tarpaulin,
pick it up from there.

403
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,506
Hold on please.

404
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:43,037
Dad, l got it.

405
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:46,539
l'll check whether it is working
properly or not.

406
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,087
What's this it sounded like an iron rod?

407
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:46,697
Recently when l had a leg fracture,
doctor used iron rod, l used it.

408
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:49,363
Bye, mom.

409
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:52,403
You spent a lot on the bike,
why don't you use it?

410
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:56,063
No, mother. lt has proven unlucky to me.
l'll catch a bus.

411
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:58,573
l said it's like a widow, no need,
but you didn't listen.

412
00:29:58,743 --> 00:29:59,675
Go, mom.

413
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:09,711
O kohl eyed beauty...
O moonbeam filled beauty...

414
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:13,119
O beauty epitomized...
O haiku in chic dress...

415
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,521
l'm after you leaving everything else...

416
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:20,927
Though what you did yesterday was wrong,
l shouldn't have slapped you.

417
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:23,129
l think my sorry has satisfied your ego.

418
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:26,429
l don't have any ego problem.
Everything is heart problem only.

419
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:29,938
You slapped on right side
but my left side is paining.

420
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,698
Will you please check it?

421
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:39,478
O my maiden, l love you...

422
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:46,113
O my dear, l wish l may become you...

423
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:52,127
My youth is seeking your companionship,
don't refuse my dear....

424
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,167
l said sorry, right?
Why are you still coming before me?

425
00:30:57,335 --> 00:31:00,236
lf l come after you may accuse me
of chasing you.

426
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:04,136
Whether you come before me or after me,
l've understood your intention.

427
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:06,174
Don't waste your time unnecessarily.

428
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:09,836
My dad has already spent Rs.10 lakhs
for my engagement.

429
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:13,451
Rs.10 lakhs for engagement?

430
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:15,779
Just say yes, l'll marry you without taking
a rupee as dowry.

431
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:17,012
lf you want l'll pay return dowry.

432
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:20,453
l've told you l'm already half married.

433
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:23,651
Had l not run away yesterday,
we would've got married fully.

434
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:26,820
Okay, can l try till you get married?

435
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,433
Even if you try till 60th birthday,
l don't think you can.

436
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:33,628
Getting positive in first sitting is difficult,
2 or 3 sittings will give you clarity.

437
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:40,643
When your fish like eyes move and look at me,
my heart is swinging with happiness...

438
00:31:40,812 --> 00:31:47,445
lf you smile like fresh jasmine,
l'll become a string of your apron...

439
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:54,252
lf you create chaos in my dreams,
how can l stop myself?

440
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:57,759
When l see you
l don't remember anything else...

441
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,092
What have you done with me to go crazy?

442
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,530
Listen to me, O dear...
You stole my hidden heart...

443
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:07,103
lf you say yes,
l'll dance to your tunes...

444
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:41,934
My heart beats for you
is ringing bells of love for you...

445
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:48,740
My heart is slipping away from me
seeing your silken tresses...

446
00:32:48,913 --> 00:32:55,682
With mock angry face, you're tying
me to your apron strings...

447
00:32:55,854 --> 00:33:02,783
You're locking me into life time
commitment with your beauty as bait...

448
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:05,953
O my ravishing beauty...
O my angry bird...

449
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:08,429
Come to me, O my beautiful queen...

450
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:13,301
He's Software Subramanyam.

451
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:15,803
He thinks he's father of software industry.

452
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:19,432
Dominating mother-in-law and
living with wife is his hobby.

453
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:23,805
Subramanyam who is on this job 24 hours,
a 24 year old boy became an hurdle to him.

454
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:27,312
How angry he gets if someone disturbs
him when he is in full flow,

455
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:28,952
you'll know when you see Subramanyam.

456
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:30,988
Who is disturbing at this hour?
- Move l need to talk.

457
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,316
Move, l need to talk.

458
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,616
l need to talk to sister.
- Sister?

459
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:34,884
What do you want to talk with your sister?

460
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,584
To know what Lakshmi's program tomorrow.

461
00:33:36,761 --> 00:33:39,195
Does your sister look like production
manager to tell you the program?

462
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:41,592
l've a doubt, do you love her or she?
- Brother-in-law!

463
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,563
What brother-in-law?
Come with me.- Just a minute.

464
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:44,827
l'll talk to my sister.

465
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:45,935
Hubby!

466
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:49,973
lf you come after my wife
to help trap some girl,

467
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:53,067
don't think l'll be soft because
l'm software engineer.

468
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:57,341
My hardware inside is intact,
if l take it out, you're finished, get out.

469
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:58,573
Get out!

470
00:33:58,817 --> 00:33:59,511
Go away!

471
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:00,708
Why are you wearing gown?

472
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,353
l beg you...come!

473
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:05,045
l'll call you later, go.

474
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:09,817
Why software Subramanyam claims
he's hardware?

475
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:12,462
He's software only.
He said that for argument.

476
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,324
You go to bed.

477
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:14,760
Just for fun?

478
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:17,090
Yes, sister-in-law!

479
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:20,864
She's Subramanyam's mother-in-law,
Sangamithra's mother, Gangamithra.

480
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,372
Though there's a software engineer in
every home like Nandi in every Shiva temple.

481
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:29,206
Gangamithra who thinks even district collector
is gully cricketer before software engineer,

482
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:37,116
she addresses software son-in-law as brother Gates,
brother Nadendla, uncle Premji and make a living!

483
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:38,779
Poor woman!

484
00:34:39,023 --> 00:34:41,048
Please have little and go.

485
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:43,194
Why are you going to office on Sunday also?

486
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:45,693
Just because it's Sunday
can l forget to wear brief?

487
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:47,832
Brief and software both work
on Sundays too.

488
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:50,695
No, hubby...
- Don't chew my brain.

489
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,464
l'll get you brain by evening,
make a dish with raw mangoes for dinner.

490
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,402
Dear...
- Hubby!- What?

491
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:59,134
Your mother! Facebook still?

492
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:00,538
What's the status?

493
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:04,079
Subramanyam going to office
for 660th time.

494
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:06,114
Add software Subramanyam, oaky?

495
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:13,254
Mother-in-law, recently when l had a bout
of jaundice and video was uploaded,

496
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:14,221
l didn't get much applause,

497
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:17,919
l consider uploading jaundice video as silly,
you're worried about applause, silly man!

498
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:21,259
My post must have at least 1000 likes
and 100 shares.

499
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:22,991
Please maintain that.

500
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:26,899
l don't mind failing CR
but PR must be perfect.

501
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,433
Okay Subramanyam.

502
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:31,074
Don't forget to add Software Subramanyam.

503
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,468
What's this Subramanyam?

504
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:03,039
lf you cut mutton in my shop,
customers will not buy from my shop.

505
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,607
Why are you so late on Sunday also?

506
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:09,270
l had to go through hell to get dressed up
to become a butcher.

507
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,278
lf you give me place,
l'll carry on with my job.

508
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:12,040
Move!

509
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:17,186
Please step aside.

510
00:36:18,189 --> 00:36:21,181
You're a man, why do you need it?
Go away.

511
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:22,620
When bad times come, you choose bad!

512
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,284
How many, madam?
- Two.

513
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:25,724
Have a blast!

514
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:31,728
Oh God!

515
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:34,731
Did he recognise me?

516
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:40,403
You take over for two minutes,
l'll come back.

517
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:43,479
What's this? You came just now
and leaving so early.

518
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:46,744
Why are you doing video piracy?
lt's illegal, give it to me.

519
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:50,547
Not your balls but your head,
to show it to your mother-in-law.

520
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:54,249
You think l'm software Subramanyam,
l'm mutton Mastan.

521
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:55,950
l don't have beard there
but l do have here.

522
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:57,856
Everything else is same.
Give this to me.

523
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:02,193
Sir, your acting is too good.
But Sulabh complex thing is too bad.

524
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:03,994
You want to see?
- Did you see everything?

525
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:05,328
No, l captured everything in video.

526
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:09,303
l beg you, l'm earning a living
working as butcher,

527
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,169
if you show this to my mother-in-law,

528
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:13,071
wreaths would be laid for
this video and my photo.

529
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:14,370
Please give it to me,
l beg you, man.

530
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:15,911
Leave me, don't worry, brother-in-law.

531
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,106
For the present you don't have any
problem with it, it'll be safe with me.

532
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:20,683
When would l get rid of this curse, lord?

533
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:22,513
When world gets peace!
- You mean?

534
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:23,847
As soon as Nagalakshmi is married.

535
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:26,217
Bloody hell, l'll never get rid of this curse.

536
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:27,354
Loud mouth!

537
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:28,958
l'll try, you help me.

538
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:33,086
After the job is done, let's sit in
Dasapalla hotel and delete it.

539
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,253
Okay?

540
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:39,793
lt's burning, check it.

541
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:43,933
Grandma! Should we help or seek help?

542
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:45,804
You must help those who seek.

543
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:47,808
Then, will you please give me
a glass of water?

544
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:48,877
You!

545
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:53,942
Mother, grandma has written a letter.

546
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:56,286
Though there are phones,
why still write letters?

547
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:57,653
What's in it?

548
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,048
My inquiries about everyone.

549
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:05,252
Your mother and son-in-law were to come here
to discuss about erecting temple mast.

550
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,556
Tell them not to come now.

551
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,824
Anandhi's mother died.

552
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,733
Entire village is mourning.

553
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:16,465
Priest Sharma's wife is also mourning.

554
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:18,869
l'll intimate after the village
comes out of this sorrow.

555
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:20,943
Whether you can come or not.
That's for now.

556
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:24,673
Mother-in-law, if anyone dies in village,
would entire village mourn it?

557
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:25,975
Not in my village,

558
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,311
you know TV serial
'Chinnari Pellikuthuru', right?

559
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:30,580
ln that serial Anandhi character's
mother is dead.

560
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:31,847
That's their problem.

561
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:35,083
Sister-in-law, brother's phone has come,
l'm keeping it here.- Okay.

562
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:38,195
Dad too got a letter...

563
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:19,532
Though office hour is over,
how come you're working so sincerely?

564
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:23,036
Not working sincerely
but thinking seriously.

565
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:26,506
What happened?
- You know about my family, right?

566
00:39:26,678 --> 00:39:29,647
Why not?
Yours is perfect happy family, right?

567
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:32,408
No jokes please, it's serious.

568
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,175
Please tell me.

569
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:36,319
There are no secrets between
anyone in family.

570
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:39,081
But today a secret has stumbled out.

571
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:43,159
l couldn't believe it but it's true.
- What's the secret?

572
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:47,160
My dad has a lover.
-Your dad?

573
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:49,090
You mean you've a step mother?

574
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,869
No, the love matter is before his marriage.
Not present time.

575
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:57,036
Yesterday my dad got a letter.

576
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,741
By mistake l read the letter
and got a big jolt.

577
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:06,283
To know if the letter is true or not,
l read my dad's diaries.

578
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:09,280
l came to know the matter
in the letter is true.

579
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:12,546
Before marriage my dad had a lover.

580
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:19,125
Unable to go against parents, dad sacrificed
his love to marry my mother.

581
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:21,054
But she wasn't like him.

582
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:24,791
She left her family for love
and living alone.

583
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:28,204
l spent all these years with memories.

584
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:32,206
Now she's having health problems
and on the verge of death.

585
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:34,641
She wants to meet my dad in her last days.

586
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:38,906
l don't have anyone.

587
00:40:39,717 --> 00:40:46,316
l didn't realise all these years but
l feel someone close should be near me.

588
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:52,621
lf you come, l'll die happily thinking
l've someone in this world.

589
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:55,824
Waiting to meet you, yours Devika.

590
00:40:56,768 --> 00:40:58,895
lf your father reads this letter,
would he to go to her?

591
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,832
No!

592
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:04,065
My dad doesn't know to change decisions
or rethink what he had decided.

593
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:05,573
He can change now, right?

594
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:08,974
Till now dad has never changed his decision.

595
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:10,580
He'll not go.

596
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:14,650
He'll feel guilty if he knows
l read this letter.

597
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:17,650
This will become starting point
of disturbance in my family.

598
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:19,652
What's your idea now?

599
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,590
l'm thinking of going myself
to console her.

600
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:25,353
Will you join me?

601
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:27,494
What did you tell your family?

602
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:32,228
First time l lied in the register about
going to Bangalore on office work.

603
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:36,464
What if your dad checks with office?
- My dad will never do that.

604
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:40,668
l'm my dad's trust not a liability.

605
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:51,950
ls this the place?
- Yes, this place only.

606
00:41:52,423 --> 00:41:54,152
Address?
- ln letter.

607
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:55,849
Where's the letter?
- ln my bag.

608
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:57,187
Where's the bag?

609
00:41:58,229 --> 00:42:00,060
ln bus!
- Bus has left!

610
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:03,394
Don't worry, bag is not in the bus
but under his armpit.

611
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:08,964
lt won't smell bad.
- No problem.

612
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:11,402
What are you doing here, Sai?

613
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:12,133
Will you stop it?

614
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,404
You gave him information and
asking what are you doing here?

615
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,172
Will you keep quiet?
How would l know?

616
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:19,578
What are you doing here?
Who is this armpit guy?

617
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:20,376
l'll tell, sister.

618
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:22,246
Nobody should tell about me.

619
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,981
l've written my autobiography,
buy and read it.

620
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:30,593
He's big thief in Rajahmundry,
my father arrested him in a case,

621
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:33,720
since he's not well, he has sent me
to drop him in Rajahmundry station.

622
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,364
By chance we boarded the
same bus you were travelling.

623
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:37,023
He was lifting your bag
and l caught him.

624
00:42:37,201 --> 00:42:38,190
That's why we got down.

625
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,303
This is the lousy story of
this lousy thief.

626
00:42:40,471 --> 00:42:41,199
Stop it, sir.

627
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:45,399
Like Lakshmi Ganapathy films 'Aadupuli' ad
repeating hundreds of times.

628
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:46,941
you're going on repeating
that l'm thief.

629
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:49,011
Do you know what did l steal,
sister Pavithra?

630
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,444
His father arrested me for
stealing a safety pin, sister.

631
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:53,447
Will you arrest for stealing a safety pin?

632
00:42:53,618 --> 00:42:56,917
lt's different matter that safety pin
had 4 sovereigns of gold.

633
00:42:58,522 --> 00:42:59,853
Aren't you ashamed to rob others?

634
00:43:00,024 --> 00:43:01,685
How can it be good if money
is stagnant in one place?

635
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,724
Won't it affect lndian economy?

636
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:06,192
Let's go, forget about them.

637
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:08,525
Those who can't wage wars
talk about justice.

638
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,599
They belong to that group.
Let's go.

639
00:43:11,302 --> 00:43:13,270
l'm here for her, let's go.
- ls it?

640
00:43:18,075 --> 00:43:21,203
Look, they're following us.
- l'll take care of them.

641
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:25,949
Why are you following us?

642
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:28,448
Not for you.

643
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,746
lt seems there's something like
that between him and her.

644
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:32,253
Shut up and mind your work.

645
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:34,891
Sister, we're coming thinking
we could be of some help.

646
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:35,991
We don't want any help.

647
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,152
Bloody punched nose lady!
Who will help you anyway?

648
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,387
He thinks so.

649
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,059
lf she needs any help, l'll do it.
You can go.

650
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,634
Will you help her?
l'll make a phone call.

651
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:54,335
Did you steal phone also?
- lt's my duty.

652
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:57,109
Do it, waiting for an hour.

653
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:58,111
Where are you, brother-in-law?

654
00:43:58,282 --> 00:43:59,476
Where would l be? ln mutton shop.

655
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,582
Tell me quickly, l'm busy.

656
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:04,744
40 kilos mutton, 10 kilos of mashed mutton,
3 heads, 6 brains, 4 legs.

657
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:05,911
He has already given tokens,
l'm dying to deliver it.

658
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,079
Wait a minute.
What do you want?

659
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:08,088
Want leg piece?

660
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:09,919
ls this okay? Get lost!

661
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:11,686
Sister is doing too much.

662
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,353
ls this new? She always does it.

663
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:15,658
l don't know what she does
or what you will do,

664
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,496
sister must get back to home
in next train in 5 minutes.

665
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:20,694
lf not you know the consequence, right?
- Are you blackmailing me?

666
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:22,430
No, l'm sending MMS to aunty.

667
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:24,574
That's what the trouble with you,
tell me what should l do now?

668
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:26,107
Tell her something, say health problem.

669
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:29,041
Say pain in hand, leg or head or body.
Tell anything you want.

670
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,441
ls this your stomach pain?

671
00:44:30,614 --> 00:44:32,673
Just do what l say.
- l'll do.

672
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:35,376
lt's Subramanyam!

673
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:39,352
Where are you?
Do you know my condition now?

674
00:44:44,562 --> 00:44:46,530
Just one day, l'll be in home
tomorrow morning.

675
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:51,134
lf you come now, come to hospital,
tomorrow come straight to cemetery.

676
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:56,167
Do you think there will be instant
reaction for phone calls?

677
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,364
Why not? Look there.

678
00:44:58,075 --> 00:45:00,873
What about my situation now, Pavithra?

679
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:04,047
l beg you, widow get up will not suit me.

680
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:07,816
Anyway l can't lose my husband
for your father.

681
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,485
Sister!
- Bus!

682
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:15,157
Sister!
- Bus is going away!

683
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:16,554
Come...come...

684
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:17,523
Stop...stop...

685
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:18,456
Come, sister.

686
00:45:18,629 --> 00:45:21,097
Pavithra, stop! What about my plight?
- Please leave me alone.

687
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:22,289
Use him.
- Use me.

688
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:23,831
He?
- He's my man, use him.

689
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,835
Please use me once.
Please use me at least once.

690
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:32,408
Please use me.
- lf you use once, one more time free.

691
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,169
l can manage my work,
you mind your work.

692
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:45,517
Yes, father.

693
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:48,084
l'll hand him over in station
and come back, father.

694
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,592
When temple bells ring, my heart rushes...

695
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:55,026
What are you doing?

696
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,635
l'm praying to God for your
speedy recovery, Lakshmi.

697
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:00,100
You're not ringing bell but sealing it.

698
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:01,295
Keep it there.
- You saw it.

699
00:46:01,505 --> 00:46:03,097
You stole my chain, cell,
are you stealing bells too?

700
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:04,866
Stop your nonsense and
tell me where am l?

701
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:06,942
You are where you should be.

702
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:08,542
How do you know the address?

703
00:46:08,712 --> 00:46:10,202
Read the letter.

704
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:11,643
You read only address, right?

705
00:46:11,816 --> 00:46:14,046
Thinking it won't be nice we read
the complete letter.

706
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:16,379
lt seems your father's love,
she's your step mother.

707
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:18,487
Do you've any sense?

708
00:46:18,656 --> 00:46:20,817
Not only had you read the letter
but made him also read it.

709
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:24,792
What are you saying?
l'm illiterate, he read and l listened.

710
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:27,325
Hold her hand,
why watch like a fool?

711
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:28,897
Shut you, you thief!

712
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:31,557
Please listen to me.
- Tell me, what's it?

713
00:46:31,735 --> 00:46:34,135
lf aunt asks who you are,
what would you say?

714
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:37,236
What did you tell her?
- You mustn't scold him, okay?

715
00:46:37,408 --> 00:46:38,602
You wait.
- Tell me.

716
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:39,902
You mustn't beat him.

717
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:42,011
l beg you!
- Okay, go ahead.

718
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:43,235
Will you tell me or not?

719
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:46,416
l told her we're going to marry soon.

720
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,816
Are you playing tricks?
How could you say that?

721
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:51,513
lf i tell you got engaged to another man
but roaming with me for some work,

722
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:53,919
it won't be nice, infact horrible,
moreover this is village.

723
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:56,616
They're very traditional,
if you don't like it, l'll tell her the truth.

724
00:46:56,794 --> 00:46:58,091
May l?
- Wait.

725
00:46:58,262 --> 00:47:00,992
lf you try to take advantage
of the situation, be careful.

726
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:02,597
l'll not...not...

727
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:07,164
Whatever you did till now was too much,
why is she saying like that?

728
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:16,471
Her walk, gait and appearance
is like her father.

729
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:17,841
lsn't she like Anand, doctor?

730
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:19,441
Stop!
- Stopped.

731
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:21,278
Did your father sent you
or you came on your own?

732
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:23,249
l came with my father's permission, aunty.

733
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,287
That's why he sent my fianc
to accompany me.

734
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:28,618
She's a big cheat.

735
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:29,554
Come.

736
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:38,298
How do you feel now?

737
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,638
Doctor, you can go now.

738
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:42,636
Bye, madam.

739
00:47:45,142 --> 00:47:46,700
Sivudu, get a pumpkin,
l must ward off evil eye cast on her.

740
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:49,539
Me? Ward off evil eye?
l feel shy, aunty.

741
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:51,981
No need of that, aunty.

742
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:52,979
Wait.

743
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,412
You too join, sunny.

744
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:56,883
Not you...you come.
- You go.

745
00:47:57,154 --> 00:47:59,486
Divine like mellifluous music of flute...

746
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:05,154
A young warrior...

747
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:33,846
Was there any day as beautiful as today...

748
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:39,189
l wish to take a new birth again...

749
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:45,029
A birth that can make me mother...

750
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:53,876
When is your birthday, aunty?

751
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:57,209
Why?
- Just asked casually.

752
00:48:57,381 --> 00:49:00,316
Don't know if l'll live till
my birthday or not.

753
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:02,646
You must tell.

754
00:49:17,234 --> 00:49:19,634
Good to eat fruits before sleep, have it.

755
00:49:19,803 --> 00:49:23,068
Yes, l too eat a coconut fruit every
night before going to sleep.

756
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:23,899
Coconut fruit?

757
00:49:24,074 --> 00:49:27,237
lt's like this, there are two halve
and we offer it to God.

758
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:28,742
lt's coconut not fruit.

759
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:29,503
Do they call like that here?

760
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,313
Anand won't fix his daughter's marriage
with you unless everything is correct.

761
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,319
Sai, if you've made him agree,
it means you're Mr.Perfect.

762
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:42,992
What do you do now?

763
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:47,761
Left engineering midway because
of too much entertainment.

764
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:49,125
Since dad was feeling too much,

765
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,768
l bargained and bought
certificate for Rs.50000.

766
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:55,033
l mustn't do any job with such
certificate, right aunty?

767
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:56,434
So, l sold grandpa's property.

768
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:59,098
Lent it on 30/0 interest and
living happily on it.

769
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,273
After marriage?
- She'll get salary, right?

770
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:02,605
l'll enjoy it.

771
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:08,050
What about after having children?
- l'll live on my dad's pension.

772
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:11,184
After children grow up?
- They'll start earning, right?

773
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:12,616
l'll enjoy it.

774
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,452
l'm better than you, l'm working to eat.

775
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:16,687
This fruit.

776
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:19,829
Your house, this back yard is very beautiful.

777
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:24,366
You live alone in this big house,
don't you've anyone?

778
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:27,800
l'm not alone, l've everyone.

779
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:30,200
l'm not there for them.

780
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:34,636
l think people who fall in love
must sacrifice something.

781
00:50:35,212 --> 00:50:39,808
Her father sacrificed love
to get closer to his family.

782
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:44,486
l gave up my family to be with my love.

783
00:50:45,422 --> 00:50:49,324
Though l was living alone and
my people were away from me,

784
00:50:49,493 --> 00:50:51,051
l didn't have any feeling,

785
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:54,226
when l came to know l'm dying,

786
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:58,067
the feeling that l'm alone
is scaring me too much.

787
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:02,835
God hasn't yet found medicines
for my disease.

788
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:05,604
God took away people from my life.

789
00:51:06,577 --> 00:51:11,514
No medicine is working,
it's my damn fate.

790
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:16,085
Let's talk tomorrow morning,
you go to sleep.

791
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:21,123
You don't have any manners.

792
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:24,750
We're here to keep her happy.
Not to hurt her.

793
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:26,759
You don't have any manners.

794
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,023
We're here to keep her happy.
Not to hurt her.

795
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:30,359
Eat orange.

796
00:51:31,001 --> 00:51:32,866
Enjoys, wants to enjoy everything.

797
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:52,548
Why did you bring coffee?

798
00:51:52,723 --> 00:51:57,126
lf l hurt my mother,
l do like to win her back.

799
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:58,728
No need to say sorry.

800
00:52:05,002 --> 00:52:07,562
l've a small surprize for you, aunty.
- Really?

801
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:09,237
Give me the cup.

802
00:52:09,506 --> 00:52:10,564
Close your eyes, aunty.

803
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:12,005
Come with me.

804
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:13,567
Come l say!

805
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:23,844
Open your eyes now.

806
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:31,260
Your entire family, didn't recognise them?

807
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:35,424
That's your elder brother.

808
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:36,861
Yes.

809
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:37,830
Their children.

810
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:41,267
Your sister, brother-in-law
and their daughter.

811
00:52:42,105 --> 00:52:45,336
This photo is recently taken in your
younger brother's daughter's marriage.

812
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:47,275
That's your nephew.

813
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,342
All are well settled, aunty.

814
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,838
You're great.

815
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:52,781
They're not great.

816
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,212
You!

817
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:57,886
lt's 25 years since l saw them.

818
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:02,282
lnfact l don't know many of them.

819
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:03,949
How could you do it in one night?

820
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,721
Last night you told your
family surname, aunty.

821
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:09,597
l searched Facebook, Orkut and twitter.

822
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:11,199
l found every one of them.

823
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:13,732
Come closer.

824
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:19,967
l lied that medicines won't work on me.

825
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:21,974
They didn't give the right medicine.

826
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,879
Do you know what that medicine is?
lt's you!

827
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:32,319
When l see you l feel like happiness
is draped in pant and shirt.

828
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:36,550
Lakshmi, when you see me, do you feel
happiness is draped in short and vest?

829
00:53:37,494 --> 00:53:40,657
Everything is okay but l couldn't
get your father's photo, aunty.

830
00:53:41,164 --> 00:53:44,099
No need, my father is there.

831
00:53:45,002 --> 00:53:47,994
ls he your father?
l thought it was Sri Krishna Devarayalu.

832
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:50,833
What did you say?

833
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:54,170
l'll get ready, let's go around the village.

834
00:53:57,514 --> 00:53:58,344
Come...

835
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,719
You're very lucky to get Sai.

836
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:07,617
He'll keep you happy all your life.

837
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:08,849
l'll stand guaranty.

838
00:54:09,426 --> 00:54:11,519
l too said the same but
she's not catching my point, aunty.

839
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:16,428
Hey you...stop...
- Come....run...run...

840
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:59,405
My life wasn't really happy or tough.

841
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:02,739
But when you both came here,
it has become wonderful.

842
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:08,647
Even if your father had come
l wouldn't have been so happy.

843
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:12,186
Next time l'll come with my dad, aunty.

844
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:23,026
Look, though life is full of struggles,
it's really great to die happily!

845
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:29,695
When Sun rises, it's very beautiful,
it's beautiful even when Sun sets!

846
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:35,601
You and Sai brought that beauty and
happiness to my house.

847
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:40,943
lf l die this minute...

848
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:57,799
Calm down, Lakshmi.

849
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:03,372
l too feel like crying.
Please don't cry.

850
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:09,478
Though didn't have any relationship,
l myself unable to control grief.

851
00:56:09,646 --> 00:56:10,544
And you...

852
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:48,610
Lakshmi, you're engaged,
have you forgotten it?

853
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:21,717
ls moonbeam spilled from your smile?

854
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:29,884
Are the colours of rainbow yours?

855
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:37,592
ls your heart beat the rushing
and gushing Godavari?

856
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:43,239
When l'm alone...

857
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:52,911
l hear your voice in the songs of cuckoos...

858
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:56,917
l'm thrilled...

859
00:57:57,087 --> 00:58:04,425
l'm seeing your face in the moon...

860
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:17,265
Are your smiles blooming
as flowers in garden?

861
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:41,052
ls the chime of your anklet turning
into a poem set to tune?

862
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:48,831
Prosperity and happiness
follows your footsteps...

863
00:58:49,005 --> 00:59:00,815
My heart is flying with happiness...

864
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:09,315
ls the gentle breeze breezing
or your breathe..

865
00:59:09,492 --> 00:59:17,331
My heart, body and soul
is floating in a trance..

866
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:04,537
Are your feet rushing like
flowing river to reach me?

867
01:00:04,714 --> 01:00:11,882
ls happiness hitting my heart like
never ending sea waves?

868
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:19,886
Our relationship will never break
even in dream...

869
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:24,898
Singing romantic duets...

870
01:00:25,068 --> 01:00:32,497
Has the mist of suspicion evaporated
in the warmth of our friendship?

871
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:34,906
Are love clouds showering
gentle rain on us?

872
01:00:55,665 --> 01:00:58,099
Stop...stop...Lakshmi...

873
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:06,370
She went away.

874
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:09,478
That's not my problem, bus has left, right?

875
01:01:09,646 --> 01:01:11,273
Don't feel sad,
let's catch an auto.

876
01:01:12,015 --> 01:01:12,674
Come.

877
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:19,219
What should l do now?
- l'll manage my father.

878
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:21,550
You carry on with your job of stealing.
- No, Sai.

879
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:22,851
What will you do now?

880
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:25,789
After seeing all this
l too want to fall in love.

881
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:38,606
Lakshmi, stop!

882
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:41,803
Are you sending your body in parcel?

883
01:01:41,978 --> 01:01:43,377
You've packed yourself fully.

884
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,406
Just for fun.

885
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:47,546
Why did you leave me alone in village?

886
01:01:47,717 --> 01:01:51,244
l didn't leave you,
l wanted to get rid of you.

887
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:54,879
You're like bad habit,
anyone would get addicted to it easily.

888
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:57,992
l don't want to become
an addict to a thing known as Sai.

889
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:01,486
Why this sudden decision?
What has happened now?

890
01:02:01,664 --> 01:02:02,323
What happened?

891
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:05,900
We both meeting and talking to
each other is not good for both of us.

892
01:02:06,102 --> 01:02:07,660
Stop, just a minute.

893
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:09,998
Leave bad habit known as Sai,
l'll not say no.

894
01:02:10,173 --> 01:02:12,437
But l helped you a lot in village
though you didn't ask me.

895
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,736
lsn't it?
- l don't deny it.

896
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:16,907
You must do me a small favour.

897
01:02:22,285 --> 01:02:25,186
For the help l did to you,
if you help me, account will be settled.

898
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:28,756
lf you say no, my credit limit will
remain with you.

899
01:02:29,392 --> 01:02:30,120
Think.

900
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:33,891
Okay, if l help you mustn't come
after me again.

901
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:35,223
You mustn't torture me.

902
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:36,695
lnfact never again show up before me.

903
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:38,026
lf you agree to these conditions, l'll do.

904
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:41,932
As Sunday specials does your father
bring hearts and livers?

905
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:43,230
Yes, why?

906
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:46,398
Nothing, you're an expert in cutting
and eating my heart.

907
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,275
lf you agree say yes
or else l'm going away.

908
01:02:49,446 --> 01:02:52,381
Okay, l agree to your conditions.
- By the way, what help should l do?

909
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:53,447
Who is the witness?

910
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:54,810
Sign it.

911
01:02:57,087 --> 01:02:59,112
l'm there for you, please.

912
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:08,627
Thank God, marriage is over.

913
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:10,265
Come, let's exchange garlands.
- What?

914
01:03:10,433 --> 01:03:12,458
l mean let's help them exchange garlands.

915
01:03:12,635 --> 01:03:13,761
Where are the garlands?

916
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:19,072
What's this?
- Biryani.

917
01:03:19,242 --> 01:03:20,402
3 chicken and 3 mutton biryanis.

918
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:22,670
No prawns?
- He said no stock.

919
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:24,904
Won't you ever spare marriage
and obsequies feast?

920
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,810
Give garlands.
- Garlands.

921
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:29,910
Exchange.

922
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:30,916
Claps!

923
01:03:38,695 --> 01:03:39,525
Father!

924
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:45,494
ls your marriage over?

925
01:03:46,836 --> 01:03:48,201
l'm very happy.

926
01:03:49,772 --> 01:03:51,000
Are you all their friends?

927
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:58,173
Aren't you both who got them married
taking their parents' place?

928
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,782
Aren't you Anand Rao's daughter?

929
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:06,281
My daughter died last night
after packing her bag.

930
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:11,260
Good up there is watching this.

931
01:04:11,427 --> 01:04:12,792
l'm sure he'll watch!

932
01:04:16,866 --> 01:04:17,992
lf daughter runs away from
home to marry,

933
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:21,399
any father would feel sad, can you
expect him to serve Bawarchi biryani?

934
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:23,198
Come on, forget it.

935
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:24,972
We didn't do anything wrong.

936
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:27,974
They both are majors, they wanted
to marry and we helped them.

937
01:04:28,144 --> 01:04:30,840
lf that is wrong, there won't be any
registered marriage in registrar's office.

938
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:32,538
Govt. should ban it.

939
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:37,415
Anyway do you need TV ad for film
not running in theatres.

940
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:40,647
Why not think about our film
which is about to release?

941
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:46,419
Look, l'll never make my father
to shed tears like him in registrar's office.

942
01:04:46,763 --> 01:04:49,630
Anyway you promised not to
disturb me in life if l do this help.

943
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,994
What's this again?
- l'll sacrifice my life for love.

944
01:04:52,168 --> 01:04:53,430
ls promise greater than life?

945
01:04:53,603 --> 01:04:54,433
l broke it.

946
01:04:54,604 --> 01:04:55,866
To hell with my promises.

947
01:04:56,039 --> 01:04:58,007
Break it or go to hell with your promises.

948
01:04:58,174 --> 01:04:59,505
l don't give a damn about it.

949
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:02,539
One last and final word.
Remember it.

950
01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:05,078
lf my father asks me to marry a dog,
l'll marry.

951
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:08,512
He found a software engineer Sathya
and told me to marry him,

952
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:10,016
he got us engaged too.

953
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:11,847
lf he tells me now that Sathya
is not fit for you,

954
01:05:12,021 --> 01:05:16,355
Sai is very good boy, he loves you too,
if he says marry him,

955
01:05:16,526 --> 01:05:17,083
l'll agree readily.

956
01:05:17,293 --> 01:05:20,456
So, stop chasing me and
go after my father.

957
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,927
You may succeed.

958
01:05:27,937 --> 01:05:30,701
Would she fall if you trap her father?

959
01:05:31,874 --> 01:05:36,243
lf you mix hot and dog,
can you get hotdog?

960
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:37,538
Forget her, Sai.

961
01:05:38,114 --> 01:05:41,572
Sai, l'm warning you,
summer is coming.

962
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:45,778
Beers are not available, even if we get
they're charging Rs.20 over MRP.

963
01:05:45,955 --> 01:05:47,650
Listen to me, forget her.

964
01:05:48,224 --> 01:05:53,287
She's a standard 120 fire shot bomb!

965
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:57,263
Some day she'll blow your heart
in mid-air 120 times.

966
01:05:57,433 --> 01:06:00,061
How dare you compare my love
with Diwali crackers!

967
01:06:00,236 --> 01:06:01,066
l'll kill you.

968
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:04,400
l'm also telling you the same,
she'll kill you some day.

969
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:06,906
Shut up!

970
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,471
You're not even the size of
sample soap kept in hotels.

971
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:12,308
Are you advising me?
1 l'll advice you.

972
01:06:12,482 --> 01:06:17,613
ln just one week.
With a week l'll make her father flat.

973
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:22,520
l'll charm her family, l'll come back
after fixing my marriage with her.

974
01:06:49,852 --> 01:06:52,184
Dear...sunny...

975
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:57,217
What happened there?

976
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,722
You went there with full force, right?

977
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:03,388
As Lakshmi told me, l tried every trick
in trade to impress her father.

978
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:07,725
Forget about impressing her father,
l got an indelible black mark in society.

979
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:09,303
Gay!

980
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:11,897
l didn't know what to do these 7 days.

981
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:15,742
When l was thinking deeply sitting in
Seethammadhara bus stop on the last day...

982
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:23,645
Did you call me, master?

983
01:07:24,354 --> 01:07:26,982
Not you, fool!
l called my grandson Prasad.

984
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:30,125
l'm also Prasad's grandson,
my grandfather's name was Prasad.

985
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:32,318
l'm blind and l'm new to this place.

986
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:34,759
He promised to come in minutes
and vanished.

987
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:37,661
Moreover l'm feeling thirsty.

988
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:39,165
Thirsty?

989
01:07:39,902 --> 01:07:41,802
Shop is very near,
come, let's have few pegs.

990
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:44,166
Hey you drunkard, l don't drink.

991
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,433
You must drink, you foolish teetotaler!

992
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:47,337
How dare you call me that!

993
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:50,343
l'll call any man a fool who doesn't drink!

994
01:07:50,513 --> 01:07:53,949
How dare you call me fool!
Bloody drunkard!

995
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:57,946
Am l still alive?

996
01:08:00,256 --> 01:08:00,984
ls it you Prasad?

997
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:03,819
Where the hell did you go away?
Get me down, where did you go away?

998
01:08:03,993 --> 01:08:08,191
Your father named you after me,
l gave my entire property to you,

999
01:08:08,364 --> 01:08:11,197
leaving me with a bloody drunkard,
where the hell did you go away?

1000
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:13,301
Where did you go?
Why don't you answer me?

1001
01:08:16,773 --> 01:08:19,367
l helped him because he's a old man!

1002
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:26,778
You can't find this address
but you eat and sleep like a log.

1003
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:28,644
This is Lakshmi's address.

1004
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:31,878
Must use this old man to trap that family.

1005
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:40,889
Why isn't anyone coming yet?
Ring the bell.

1006
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:42,128
What happened?

1007
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:43,664
Hello master!

1008
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:47,227
What? When did you come?
How do you do?

1009
01:08:47,403 --> 01:08:50,600
l'm very fine,
l'm angry because of hot sun.

1010
01:08:50,773 --> 01:08:53,401
Anyway no problem, whatever it is,
talk to me here only.

1011
01:08:53,576 --> 01:08:54,406
l'll go from here only.

1012
01:08:54,577 --> 01:08:56,044
You too want the same, right?

1013
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:56,906
Didn't l tell you?

1014
01:08:57,079 --> 01:08:58,512
Okay master, please come in.
Come in.

1015
01:08:58,681 --> 01:09:02,048
He's my grandson Prasad.

1016
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:06,120
You may start grousing if l bring him
without introducing him.

1017
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:07,688
Greet him.

1018
01:09:07,857 --> 01:09:09,586
He's a great egoist.

1019
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:11,718
l think...

1020
01:09:11,894 --> 01:09:14,192
What are you thinking?
You want me to come in or go?

1021
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,423
Why are you asking like that?
Please come in.

1022
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:17,827
Come in, silly boy!

1023
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,262
Come in, sir....come...

1024
01:09:20,603 --> 01:09:21,865
This is my house, master.

1025
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:25,838
Very nice, whether it is yours or mine,
l can't see anything, right?

1026
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:27,600
Come.

1027
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:28,607
Please come and sit here.

1028
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:30,435
Why are you sitting on floor?
Please get up, sir.

1029
01:09:30,613 --> 01:09:33,912
No problem, l'll sit on floor.
No need to spoil your sofas.

1030
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,107
Please get up.

1031
01:09:35,284 --> 01:09:37,445
You haven't changed a bit.

1032
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,621
Please come....sit here.
That's fine.

1033
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:45,154
They'll wash their homes clean
after people like us visit.

1034
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:46,955
To ward off evil eye cast.

1035
01:09:47,163 --> 01:09:49,154
What are you saying sir?
You haven't changed a bit.

1036
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:51,391
You please sit down.

1037
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:54,330
Amaravathi, Master has come,
please get tea.

1038
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:55,729
Did you see? Didn't l tell you?

1039
01:09:55,905 --> 01:10:00,740
They'll offer tea and coffee to visitors like us
but they'll have Horlicks and Bournvita.

1040
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:02,341
Okay, tell me what would you like to have?

1041
01:10:02,545 --> 01:10:04,740
Give me half of your property.
Will you?

1042
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:07,972
Please have coffee.
- Master, my wife Amaravathi.

1043
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:09,675
They're my sons.
- Greetings, sir.

1044
01:10:09,852 --> 01:10:12,082
They're my daughters-in-law.
- Greetings, sir.

1045
01:10:12,288 --> 01:10:13,653
Lakshmi, please come here.

1046
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:22,421
Come....please come.
Master is here.

1047
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:25,959
My daughter Lakshmi.

1048
01:10:26,135 --> 01:10:28,899
He's my grandson Pravin.
- Good...very good.

1049
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:33,007
Mine is also very big family.
All are gone.

1050
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:35,904
Only he's left.

1051
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,712
Wait...wait...you're keeping on his head.

1052
01:10:39,882 --> 01:10:43,283
Why l came to you because,
it seems he want passport,

1053
01:10:43,419 --> 01:10:44,784
if it is necessary,
he must stay here for 2 days,

1054
01:10:44,954 --> 01:10:46,012
l'll stay here!

1055
01:10:46,188 --> 01:10:47,985
Even if you wish nobody would
wish to keep you!

1056
01:10:48,157 --> 01:10:50,625
Are you saying even if l wish
who would keep me?

1057
01:10:51,193 --> 01:10:51,682
Nothing like that.

1058
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:55,353
l'll not stay but if it is necessary,
my grandson will stay here for 2 days.

1059
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:56,623
You'll not have any problem.

1060
01:10:56,799 --> 01:11:00,394
4 kilos of rice, 4 brinjals,
he'll bring snake gourd also,

1061
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:02,697
show him the kitchen,
he'll cook his meals.

1062
01:11:02,872 --> 01:11:04,203
lf you say like that we'll feel bad.

1063
01:11:04,373 --> 01:11:07,706
Did he utter a word after coming here?
He's very innocent boy.

1064
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:10,368
lf you talk non-stop, how can he talk?

1065
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:11,274
What are you saying?

1066
01:11:11,414 --> 01:11:15,145
Nothing, send off grandpa safely in bus.

1067
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:16,946
Grandpa!

1068
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:18,313
What's this? You're here but
voice is coming from there.

1069
01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:19,785
ls he his real grandson?

1070
01:11:19,956 --> 01:11:22,584
You say you're smart, couldn't you find
difference between him and me?

1071
01:11:22,758 --> 01:11:25,022
You both are using the same body spray.

1072
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:26,456
Did this help me?

1073
01:11:27,463 --> 01:11:29,795
Putting grandpa in bus and
lying to my mother.

1074
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:31,433
l packed my bag.

1075
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:35,298
Won't you tell me when you'll be
back after roaming aimlessly?

1076
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:37,565
l'm going to Bangalore for
a big business deal.

1077
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,297
Move away.

1078
01:11:38,441 --> 01:11:40,671
l reached Lakshmi's home at 120 kmph
at 40 degree Sun,

1079
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:42,777
and stopped just 2 metres away!

1080
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:45,436
l got a doubt whether to enter the
house with left or right leg first.

1081
01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:47,082
l'll break your legs.

1082
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:49,076
not you!

1083
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:50,244
Hold this.

1084
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:52,853
That cat!
lt is torturing me every day.

1085
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:54,080
Please come in.

1086
01:11:54,423 --> 01:11:55,185
Why do you hesitate?

1087
01:11:55,358 --> 01:11:56,484
l entered meekly like that,

1088
01:11:56,692 --> 01:12:00,594
family members who hesitated
to ask if l want coffee or tea,

1089
01:12:00,763 --> 01:12:02,856
l saw drastic change in 2 days,

1090
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:05,991
from small errands like changing
Rs.1000 note,

1091
01:12:06,168 --> 01:12:08,762
to lousy job of putting
naphthalene balls in toilets,

1092
01:12:08,938 --> 01:12:10,200
they've come so close
to tell me all this.

1093
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:14,239
Though entire family accepted me as
one of theirs, uncle still suspected me.

1094
01:12:17,313 --> 01:12:19,213
Oh No! l think he has recognised me.

1095
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:23,876
What's it, uncle?

1096
01:12:24,053 --> 01:12:24,917
Where did you go now?

1097
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,281
To wine shop!

1098
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:28,821
Balaji temple near wine shop.

1099
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:33,121
l went to pray for getting passport early
and go abroad.

1100
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:35,287
Hail Lord Balaji!

1101
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,134
One day Lakshmi asked me
to come to north side gate.

1102
01:12:40,302 --> 01:12:42,293
l thought she called me to run
some errand for her.

1103
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:44,867
l'll tell about you to my father.
- Why?

1104
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:47,032
My grandpa took his permission, right?
To stay here.

1105
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:48,039
l know all that.

1106
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,236
Neither you're his grandson
nor he's your grandpa.

1107
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:54,146
You told me to impress
your father instead of you.

1108
01:12:54,316 --> 01:12:58,082
lmpressing means cheating
and lying to get into house.

1109
01:12:58,254 --> 01:12:59,812
Every is valid for love.

1110
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:03,322
Small lie, little bit of cheating,
small dose of selfishness,

1111
01:13:03,492 --> 01:13:06,154
everything put together is like
Telugu New year 'Pachchadi'.

1112
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:08,829
l don't know how she understood
my dialogue,

1113
01:13:08,998 --> 01:13:11,831
from that day she stopped
observing me.

1114
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:22,440
Like Tabu joins Nagarjuna's family in
Krishna Vamsi's film 'Ninne Pelladatha',

1115
01:13:22,578 --> 01:13:24,671
their family accepted me as a member.

1116
01:13:25,181 --> 01:13:28,275
Like mixing half litre water
in 10 litres of milk,

1117
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:30,009
they used me like that.

1118
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:34,416
Like hitting the highway, they entrusted me
with baby shower of sister Vasantha.

1119
01:13:35,224 --> 01:13:36,748
You don't know who sister Vasantha is, right?

1120
01:13:36,926 --> 01:13:39,360
Lakshmi's younger sister-in-law.
My elder sister.

1121
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:40,586
Like real sister.

1122
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:43,697
l was busy with work, l came out
to bring a bunch of bananas.

1123
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:45,794
Oh, it's here, they left it here.

1124
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:50,702
l saw this sari somewhere!

1125
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:54,543
Oh no mother!

1126
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:57,804
Come here...come here...
Come here l say!

1127
01:13:58,314 --> 01:13:58,905
Mother!

1128
01:13:59,081 --> 01:13:59,979
Come here!

1129
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:01,047
Mother, that is...

1130
01:14:01,217 --> 01:14:02,616
Come near me.

1131
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:06,447
Fool! You said you're going to Bangalore
for a big business deal.

1132
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:08,113
Why are you picking bananas on road?

1133
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:11,054
Please mother...l'll tell you later.
- What will you tell later?

1134
01:14:11,227 --> 01:14:12,626
What will you tell?
- Please go away, mother.

1135
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:15,558
Okay, l'll and tell everything
to your father.

1136
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:18,560
Something is wrong here.

1137
01:14:21,937 --> 01:14:24,497
Wrong! Please go away.

1138
01:14:25,207 --> 01:14:26,572
Please go away, mother.

1139
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:29,677
Oh No, he saw you.
Please go, mother.

1140
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:33,337
Who is he?
- l beg you, mother.

1141
01:14:33,516 --> 01:14:35,416
lt was my mistake, please go, mother.

1142
01:14:35,951 --> 01:14:37,248
What's the problem there, Prasad?

1143
01:14:38,521 --> 01:14:39,920
Why is he calling you as Prasad?

1144
01:14:43,893 --> 01:14:44,416
Who is she?

1145
01:14:44,593 --> 01:14:47,585
Married women please come in.
- Aunty!

1146
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,091
Married woman!

1147
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:54,601
Aunty invited 1 1 married women, uncle.

1148
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:56,032
10 women are here.

1149
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:57,968
Rs.500 remuneration.

1150
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,267
She's 1 1th woman.

1151
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:04,879
But she's asking Rs.1 1 16.

1152
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:07,515
Very busy woman!
She's refusing.

1153
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:11,450
lt's small matter, elderly woman.
Let's pay her.

1154
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:11,984
Please come in, madam.

1155
01:15:12,154 --> 01:15:13,519
You please go, l'll bring her, uncle.

1156
01:15:13,656 --> 01:15:15,681
You said you'll pay, l'll bring her.
- Bring her.

1157
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:21,858
Did l came to attend function?
- Please mother.

1158
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:23,191
lf you don't come, l'll die, mother.

1159
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:25,128
My plan will flop!
Please come, mother.

1160
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:27,861
Are you asking me to cheat others like you?

1161
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:55,824
How beauty is adding to her!

1162
01:15:56,832 --> 01:15:59,995
is it because of immense wealth?

1163
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:12,837
As happiness of blessing douses
this queen...

1164
01:16:13,015 --> 01:16:18,681
As every hand here is adding beauty
to her with sandalwood paste...

1165
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:55,346
Would the child be like Krishna
who steals butter and plays flute?

1166
01:16:55,524 --> 01:17:00,757
Would he be a great archer like Rama?

1167
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:06,232
Whether he's God or human,
it'll be known in time...

1168
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:38,598
ls it that girl?
- How did you know it, mother?

1169
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:41,600
l can know seeing her,
anyone would do anything for her.

1170
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:44,261
Mother too was greatly
impressed by Lakshmi.

1171
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,471
Don't create any trouble here,
come home quickly.

1172
01:17:47,643 --> 01:17:48,268
Okay?

1173
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:51,140
Every little or big step l took ended
in grand success.

1174
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:54,840
With the same confidence and
same enthusiasm, l took a wrong step.

1175
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:57,450
l didn't know it was wrong step
till l took that step.

1176
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:02,223
When she entered bathroom,
l entered next bathroom to clear my doubt.

1177
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:12,961
Rama built bridge on sea
from Kanyakumari to Srilanka,

1178
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:15,399
l thought it was Hanuman
or Monkey army's help.

1179
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:20,065
Now l understood that Rama could
do it because of his love for Seetha.

1180
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:24,576
l'm very happy now.
Because 900/0 of my job is over.

1181
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:27,238
Your entire family considers me
as one of them.

1182
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:30,078
Your father took me to the
temple thrice this week.

1183
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:31,719
Your mother who used to ask me
to eat what she cooked.

1184
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:33,981
Now she asks me what l would like
to have for dinner?

1185
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:35,987
Your elder brother wants
my company to smoke,

1186
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:37,819
your second brother asks my advice
to sell the shares,

1187
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:39,893
they've become so close
to share all this with me.

1188
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:42,359
your sisters-in-law consider me
as their own brother.

1189
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:44,590
You must see when Pravin
calls me as uncle!

1190
01:18:44,767 --> 01:18:47,827
l'm as happy as l'm getting awarded
doctoral degree by Andhra University.

1191
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:50,096
Even your house servants feel
l'm as their own.

1192
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:51,398
Just only you remain.

1193
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:54,064
No need to say l love you to me,
just say yes, that's enough.

1194
01:18:54,243 --> 01:18:55,267
Won't you?

1195
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:58,171
l did so much,
can't l get an ayes from you?

1196
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:00,275
l'll plan how to make you say yes.

1197
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:03,282
You take bath and come,
it won't be nice if anyone sees us.

1198
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:07,681
What?

1199
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:10,620
Father!

1200
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:36,883
Who are you?

1201
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:39,647
Are you here to disturb
a well designed family?

1202
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:42,723
lsn't it you who lied that night for lift
and got down at wine shop?

1203
01:19:42,891 --> 01:19:44,222
l did that mistake unwittingly, uncle.

1204
01:19:44,693 --> 01:19:46,126
lt's natural to make mistakes.

1205
01:19:46,295 --> 01:19:50,061
lt must be like dot which can be wiped
not like tattoo forever.

1206
01:19:50,232 --> 01:19:53,065
l take extra care to keep dust and
garbage from entering my home.

1207
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:57,194
l work like a repellant for my house.
But garbage entered my home.

1208
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:59,840
That's why l waiting for it to cross
my compound wall.

1209
01:19:59,975 --> 01:20:00,907
Come l say!

1210
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:09,710
l'll talk to Lakshmi once...
- Shut up!

1211
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:13,354
l don't want you to utter
my daughter's name again.

1212
01:20:14,223 --> 01:20:16,691
l'll not give you lift again,
how can you expect me to give my daughter?

1213
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:19,384
l don't care who you are and
why you came here!

1214
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:22,189
But if l see you anywhere near
my house again,

1215
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:24,958
if my family faces any problem from you,

1216
01:20:25,167 --> 01:20:27,158
l'll tear you into two!

1217
01:21:10,879 --> 01:21:16,476
lf l see you again in this area or
if my family faces trouble from you,

1218
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:18,085
l'll tear you into two!

1219
01:21:20,556 --> 01:21:23,423
l thought about you...

1220
01:21:24,026 --> 01:21:26,824
l loved and left you...

1221
01:21:27,663 --> 01:21:31,656
l'm living for you only...

1222
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:39,234
l'm seeing myself in you...

1223
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:49,174
When the time came to open
the letter and read...

1224
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:53,452
lt got burnt, my dear...

1225
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:08,796
You're very lucky, Sai.

1226
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:12,899
God gave you stone heart,
tear less eyes, shameless body,

1227
01:22:13,075 --> 01:22:15,305
and insensitive life...

1228
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:18,378
l was saying God created you very strong.

1229
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:20,604
But all are not like you, Sai.

1230
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:24,610
There are sensitive people too.
l top such people.

1231
01:22:25,554 --> 01:22:28,717
Second place is almost occupied
by Sathyam Rajesh.

1232
01:22:28,924 --> 01:22:30,050
Sathyam Rajesh?

1233
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:32,484
My friend's cousin's friend's cousin.

1234
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:34,027
Just as you experienced,

1235
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:35,652
Seemandhra-Telengana,

1236
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:38,823
in every street, at some gate,
at any time,

1237
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:41,060
in the hands of a beautiful daughter's father,

1238
01:22:41,236 --> 01:22:43,636
a sincere lover would be thrown out!

1239
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:49,344
Just as you had yesterday,
the same insult,

1240
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:51,570
Sathyam Rajesh too got insulted
in the next street,

1241
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:55,147
but Sathyam Rajesh who is in the
second place in sensitivity,

1242
01:22:55,317 --> 01:22:57,842
he attempted to commit suicide.
- Did he die?

1243
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,750
He would but a passerby saved him.

1244
01:23:01,623 --> 01:23:03,090
He's crying profusely.

1245
01:23:03,425 --> 01:23:06,292
Please talk to him and enthuse him.

1246
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:07,428
Where is he?

1247
01:23:12,668 --> 01:23:14,932
ls it wrong to fall in love?
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1248
01:23:15,103 --> 01:23:16,536
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1249
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,098
Do you've any shame?

1250
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:21,139
lf your lover's father throws you
out of home,

1251
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:23,335
will you commit suicide?
Are you really a man?

1252
01:23:25,981 --> 01:23:28,279
Please calm down.
Tell me what had happened?

1253
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:30,884
ls it wrong to fall in love?
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1254
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:32,179
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1255
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:34,446
Why are you repeating
the dialogue three times?

1256
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,058
l can't bear it.

1257
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:41,551
Tell me about your love.

1258
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:45,157
l saw her for the first time in park.

1259
01:23:56,144 --> 01:24:00,046
Where is the star?

1260
01:24:00,382 --> 01:24:04,819
The maiden who is creating chaos
in my heart...

1261
01:24:05,854 --> 01:24:07,481
Next we met in coffee shop.

1262
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:13,092
Love is not easy, you can't win love...

1263
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:18,598
What are the conditions for love?
What are the secrets of love?

1264
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:21,065
One day we went to shopping mall
to buy clothes.

1265
01:24:22,971 --> 01:24:24,836
Lonely time...

1266
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:29,239
Personalized service...

1267
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,714
Your mischief...

1268
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:37,879
lt lit fire of passion...

1269
01:24:38,053 --> 01:24:40,180
Along with trying out new clothes...

1270
01:24:42,224 --> 01:24:44,954
The matter reached her father's ears.

1271
01:24:45,594 --> 01:24:46,356
He called me.

1272
01:24:47,562 --> 01:24:48,859
l thought to discuss.

1273
01:24:49,531 --> 01:24:50,759
After l went l came to know.

1274
01:24:51,099 --> 01:24:52,259
lt was to fight.

1275
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:54,435
l climbed the wall to escape.

1276
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:56,428
He slapped me!

1277
01:24:56,605 --> 01:24:58,300
He held me by my collar and
threw me out of the house!

1278
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,541
He threatened to break my legs
if l talk about love again.

1279
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:04,144
ls it wrong to fall in love?
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1280
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:06,713
ls it wrong to fall in love?
- No!

1281
01:25:07,048 --> 01:25:10,415
Mine is one side love,
the girl has no clarity.

1282
01:25:10,585 --> 01:25:13,986
You both are clear, right?
What's your problem then?

1283
01:25:15,724 --> 01:25:19,216
Let's settle this, call all our boys.

1284
01:25:19,394 --> 01:25:19,985
Come on, boys.

1285
01:25:52,661 --> 01:25:53,491
What's the name?

1286
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:56,695
Not your name.
Your father-in-law's name.

1287
01:25:58,533 --> 01:25:59,261
Come out!

1288
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:02,929
ls it him?

1289
01:26:03,905 --> 01:26:06,430
Why did you come here again?

1290
01:26:06,808 --> 01:26:09,299
Go away form here if not
l'll tear you into two.

1291
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:12,276
What will you tear?
ls his head croton to cut?

1292
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:13,106
Who are you?

1293
01:26:13,281 --> 01:26:14,771
We're his friends to settle his love matter.

1294
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:18,113
Do you think l'll get scared of you
bring few friends?

1295
01:26:18,286 --> 01:26:19,150
Go away from here.

1296
01:26:19,321 --> 01:26:20,652
Why are you threatening us?

1297
01:26:20,822 --> 01:26:22,653
You don't have that much scene,
they both are majors.

1298
01:26:22,824 --> 01:26:24,223
Call your daughter.

1299
01:26:24,392 --> 01:26:25,859
l'll not call her, go away.

1300
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:27,922
l told you to call your daughter out.

1301
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,654
l said l'll not call her.

1302
01:26:29,831 --> 01:26:31,355
He told you to call your daughter.

1303
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:33,329
You fool! l don't have daughters at all!

1304
01:26:33,502 --> 01:26:35,129
l've two sons only!

1305
01:26:35,637 --> 01:26:36,467
Sons?

1306
01:26:38,306 --> 01:26:41,241
His second son is tall, fair
and handsome.

1307
01:26:41,376 --> 01:26:42,900
You too would like him.

1308
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,640
There's my prince!

1309
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:52,752
Stop your mischievous looks...

1310
01:26:53,021 --> 01:26:57,082
Don't incite mischievous thoughts in me...

1311
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,187
Later wee met in a coffee shop.

1312
01:27:00,362 --> 01:27:12,502
lt's a meeting of love and romance...

1313
01:27:14,042 --> 01:27:16,602
What does it say?

1314
01:27:16,778 --> 01:27:19,372
lf there's will, there's way...

1315
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:25,783
lf you say yes, l'll do and
show to this world...

1316
01:27:28,757 --> 01:27:30,691
One day we went to buy clothes.

1317
01:27:31,259 --> 01:27:37,425
What should l do till we tie the knot?

1318
01:27:37,933 --> 01:27:43,132
l'll become yours forever...

1319
01:27:44,706 --> 01:27:45,798
Bloody!

1320
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:48,339
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1321
01:27:48,476 --> 01:27:50,205
Wrong? Totally wrong!

1322
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,805
Not you, Navin...

1323
01:27:55,016 --> 01:27:57,541
Come here, dear.

1324
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:01,287
l'm in frustration with love failure,

1325
01:28:01,423 --> 01:28:03,653
why did you get me into this
bloody sentiment?

1326
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,667
What's this expression, Bablu?

1327
01:28:13,835 --> 01:28:16,736
Do something and save my love, sir.

1328
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:18,099
You must help my love to succeed.

1329
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:21,902
l didn't this force in anyone till now.
Please do something, sir.

1330
01:28:28,483 --> 01:28:31,975
lf you both ever come before me
...get lost!

1331
01:28:32,153 --> 01:28:34,644
Please do something,
you can do, sir.

1332
01:28:35,323 --> 01:28:36,187
Thank God!

1333
01:28:36,992 --> 01:28:39,756
Don't come near me.
l'll throw stones at you.

1334
01:28:44,432 --> 01:28:45,763
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1335
01:28:46,067 --> 01:28:47,261
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1336
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:48,763
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1337
01:28:58,179 --> 01:28:58,941
Get into the car.

1338
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:00,106
Get in!

1339
01:29:00,248 --> 01:29:02,148
Mother told me to get milk.

1340
01:29:02,317 --> 01:29:04,683
You can take curd sachets
by evening, get in.

1341
01:29:17,265 --> 01:29:18,129
Please sit.

1342
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,698
You too!

1343
01:29:20,869 --> 01:29:21,801
Would you like to have water?

1344
01:29:30,512 --> 01:29:36,542
lt seems he hit at 9.20 pm.
She came home crying.

1345
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:39,049
You got them married as their parents, right?

1346
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:40,278
Tell her what you want to!

1347
01:29:40,455 --> 01:29:43,151
The moment l knew he hit my daughter,
l would've killed him.

1348
01:29:43,491 --> 01:29:46,187
But l'm waiting to tell you and
then go for the kill.

1349
01:29:46,361 --> 01:29:47,157
What do you want me to do?

1350
01:29:47,328 --> 01:29:50,263
We didn't expect this to happen.

1351
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:52,764
Will you please stop it?
Why are you saying sorry?

1352
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:55,198
lf you say sorry, l too share 500/0 of it.

1353
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:57,964
Uncle, kill him.

1354
01:29:58,139 --> 01:29:59,834
Kill him and conduct his obsequies.

1355
01:30:00,008 --> 01:30:02,340
Marry her off to some American lndian.

1356
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:03,943
Next time he'll hit her there.

1357
01:30:04,112 --> 01:30:07,138
Catch a flight, kill him and
conduct his obsequies,

1358
01:30:07,315 --> 01:30:09,943
Next time get her married
to someone in Australia.

1359
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:13,554
He'll also hit her, kill him too and
conduct his obsequies.

1360
01:30:13,755 --> 01:30:15,382
Then, you go and ask your daughter, uncle.

1361
01:30:15,557 --> 01:30:18,185
ls she's a wife or prostitute?

1362
01:30:19,527 --> 01:30:22,963
Anyway you're not worried about your
son-in-law hitting her or your daughter crying,

1363
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:24,996
You're angry because you didn't
conduct this marriage.

1364
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:29,569
Had you arranged this marriage with
wedding cards, rituals, feast and dowry,

1365
01:30:29,738 --> 01:30:31,000
you wouldn't be speaking like this, uncle.

1366
01:30:31,172 --> 01:30:32,400
You know how you'd respond to this,

1367
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:35,199
Won't husband and wife ever fight?

1368
01:30:35,376 --> 01:30:39,073
lf he comes home with tension,
you must pacify him with cool behaviour,

1369
01:30:39,247 --> 01:30:40,441
would anyone fight with him then?

1370
01:30:40,615 --> 01:30:41,912
Aunty, you!

1371
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:42,606
Do you've any sense?

1372
01:30:42,817 --> 01:30:45,911
l've been living with your father for
30 years, did l do like this any time?

1373
01:30:46,087 --> 01:30:48,487
He hit me so many times and
l shouted on him many times.

1374
01:30:48,623 --> 01:30:49,612
Did we ever wash linen in public?

1375
01:30:49,824 --> 01:30:52,918
You'd have talked to her and
sent her back to her home.

1376
01:30:53,094 --> 01:30:54,618
But it's not like that here.

1377
01:30:54,829 --> 01:30:56,922
Because you didn't conduct
their marriage.

1378
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:58,725
Since you didn't do it,
you don't care if it succeeds or fails,

1379
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,561
that's your ego!

1380
01:31:01,636 --> 01:31:05,299
Uncle, just two hearts are enough
to fall in love,

1381
01:31:05,473 --> 01:31:08,567
just two friends are enough to marry,

1382
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:13,578
but they need parents support
for all their lives.

1383
01:31:13,748 --> 01:31:19,482
Since that's not happening, 900/0 of love
marriages are making 700/0 lawyers richer.

1384
01:31:20,622 --> 01:31:21,646
Think over it, uncle.

1385
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:25,258
You're en elder man,
you know things much better.

1386
01:31:28,096 --> 01:31:31,930
What could be settled over a phone call,
do you've to go to court?

1387
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:38,999
Tell me.
- Where are you?

1388
01:31:39,174 --> 01:31:39,902
Outside.

1389
01:31:40,074 --> 01:31:41,769
Your father-in-law wants to talk to you.

1390
01:31:43,077 --> 01:31:43,941
Talk to him.

1391
01:31:44,979 --> 01:31:45,536
Take it.

1392
01:31:49,684 --> 01:31:51,709
Father-in-law! Are you fine?

1393
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:56,456
Sorry, father-in-law, a small tiff,
l'll come and take her home.

1394
01:31:56,624 --> 01:31:57,955
No problem.

1395
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,425
Did you've lunch?
- Just now.

1396
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:06,432
Tomorrow is Sunday,
come for evening dinner.

1397
01:32:06,634 --> 01:32:07,532
You can her home.

1398
01:32:15,977 --> 01:32:17,808
l've a very good son-in-law.

1399
01:32:17,979 --> 01:32:20,470
l wouldn't have got such a son-in-law
even if l had spent millions.

1400
01:32:20,648 --> 01:32:23,014
You're right, he works with lnfosys,

1401
01:32:23,184 --> 01:32:25,345
it seems his salary is Rs.1 lakh a month!

1402
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,852
All the credit for this goes
to his friend Sai.

1403
01:32:28,022 --> 01:32:30,081
He's very good boy.
- Yes.

1404
01:32:35,763 --> 01:32:37,025
Though you didn't have any fight,

1405
01:32:37,198 --> 01:32:38,927
l got you both patch up with
your father-in-law,

1406
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,261
since l too can meet Lakshmi,
l planned this.

1407
01:32:41,436 --> 01:32:42,403
What actually had happened was...

1408
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:45,130
l entered the house to impress her father.

1409
01:32:45,306 --> 01:32:46,534
Very bad horoscope, right?

1410
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:49,677
l got caught for my silly mistake
and her father threw me out.

1411
01:32:50,245 --> 01:32:53,214
After l tried many times but
she didn't like to meet me.

1412
01:32:53,414 --> 01:32:54,745
That's why l planned this.

1413
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:57,017
One shot two angry birds!

1414
01:32:57,485 --> 01:32:58,315
What do you say?

1415
01:32:58,486 --> 01:33:00,010
She's coming.

1416
01:33:05,493 --> 01:33:07,859
Please listen to me.

1417
01:33:08,029 --> 01:33:09,929
lf you don't stop, l'll not eat.

1418
01:33:10,632 --> 01:33:12,532
What bothers me if you don't eat?

1419
01:33:12,867 --> 01:33:15,358
Anyway you had a go at food just now.

1420
01:33:15,536 --> 01:33:18,198
Did you see? l forgot whether l ate
or not lost in your thoughts.

1421
01:33:18,373 --> 01:33:19,135
l'm eating again and again.

1422
01:33:19,307 --> 01:33:20,934
l've told you earlier also, Sai.

1423
01:33:21,109 --> 01:33:23,634
l'll marry if my father selects a dog.

1424
01:33:23,778 --> 01:33:27,771
l told you to give a try.
You failed, it's all over.

1425
01:33:27,982 --> 01:33:33,545
lf my father is asked to write 10 names he hates,
he would write your name 1 1 times.

1426
01:33:33,721 --> 01:33:34,710
For the present he may not like,

1427
01:33:34,889 --> 01:33:36,754
infact my friend and his father-in-law were
at loggerheads,

1428
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:37,652
but l united them!

1429
01:33:37,792 --> 01:33:39,885
Why would l separate you from your father?

1430
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:44,896
l'll take care of all that.
- Give a try! But please leave me alone.

1431
01:33:45,967 --> 01:33:49,630
l'm telling you again, l'll marry a dog
if my father says so.

1432
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:54,903
Will you marry a dog?

1433
01:33:55,443 --> 01:33:58,344
What will you do marrying a dog?
Will you take it for a walk?

1434
01:33:59,547 --> 01:34:01,276
You're proud because l'm after you.

1435
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:04,180
May l tell you this, you looked like
an angel when l saw you first time.

1436
01:34:04,352 --> 01:34:05,683
After that always looked like a devil.

1437
01:34:07,622 --> 01:34:09,647
Bloody loose tongue!

1438
01:34:10,425 --> 01:34:13,758
Stop!

1439
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:16,087
l'll fall at your feet!

1440
01:34:29,277 --> 01:34:34,271
You fell like gentle rain drops...

1441
01:34:34,449 --> 01:34:39,216
Next moment you vanished away...

1442
01:34:39,387 --> 01:34:44,450
You're love thought...
You're my love...

1443
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:49,688
My life is soaring high in air
with your love...

1444
01:34:49,831 --> 01:34:54,825
My heart says go after her...

1445
01:34:55,036 --> 01:35:00,565
My thoughts are after you saying yes...

1446
01:35:05,913 --> 01:35:07,039
ls it for that girl?

1447
01:35:08,282 --> 01:35:10,614
Mad boy! Today is Sunday, she'll not come.

1448
01:35:11,319 --> 01:35:12,616
Come.
- Father.

1449
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:15,150
Come l say!
- Why?

1450
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:17,150
Nothing, come with me.

1451
01:35:23,831 --> 01:35:24,889
Why did you bring me here, father?

1452
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:29,665
Here...
- Nothing, son.

1453
01:35:29,837 --> 01:35:31,065
What are you doing?

1454
01:35:32,006 --> 01:35:32,597
Come!

1455
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:35,837
Come!

1456
01:35:36,344 --> 01:35:37,868
Come.
- Greetings, tell me.

1457
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:39,068
ls your daughter in home?

1458
01:35:39,247 --> 01:35:41,181
Call her.
- Why? What happened?

1459
01:35:41,349 --> 01:35:43,078
Call her, don't get tensed.

1460
01:35:43,551 --> 01:35:46,019
What's this, father?
- Her name is Kumari.

1461
01:35:55,930 --> 01:35:57,693
Why did you call me now, father?
l was making dosas.

1462
01:35:58,332 --> 01:35:59,299
My daughter Kumari.

1463
01:36:04,806 --> 01:36:10,210
Here's the girl you were ogling
at every day!

1464
01:36:14,315 --> 01:36:15,213
Didn't recognise her, right?

1465
01:36:16,117 --> 01:36:18,677
With make-up then and
now without make-up.

1466
01:36:19,921 --> 01:36:22,219
Girls look like that when you fall in love.

1467
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:24,551
They look like this after marriage.

1468
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:27,127
You must see them like this
for all your life.

1469
01:36:27,428 --> 01:36:34,596
Seeing her like that you chase, love,
marry her in registrar's office,

1470
01:36:34,769 --> 01:36:36,669
and when you take her home,

1471
01:36:36,904 --> 01:36:38,667
in about 3 months,

1472
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,437
unable to see her like this,

1473
01:36:40,608 --> 01:36:43,406
father, l made a mistake,
l don't you want you to regret later,

1474
01:36:44,245 --> 01:36:45,075
Watch her now itself!

1475
01:36:46,814 --> 01:36:47,678
ls she okay to you?

1476
01:36:47,849 --> 01:36:49,749
Do you know what are you saying, father?

1477
01:36:51,486 --> 01:36:54,580
You came to my home,
rang the bell,

1478
01:36:54,755 --> 01:36:56,780
why are you leaving after showing
my daughter in bad light?

1479
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:58,926
l didn't show her in bad light
but helped her.

1480
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:02,421
My son is trying sincerely
for your daughter.

1481
01:37:02,663 --> 01:37:03,925
As his father l shouldn't say this.

1482
01:37:04,098 --> 01:37:06,089
My son is a rogue!

1483
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:11,263
lf he tries sincerely,
your daughter's life would get ruined.

1484
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:14,703
Tell me now, did l help you
or harmed you?

1485
01:37:14,876 --> 01:37:16,173
Thank so much, master.

1486
01:37:16,344 --> 01:37:17,936
You go and make dosas.

1487
01:37:18,112 --> 01:37:22,105
Go inside, l'll throw away your make-up kit.

1488
01:37:25,386 --> 01:37:26,512
What's this, Sai?

1489
01:37:26,687 --> 01:37:29,622
l was fixing your marriage with the
girl you like, why did you walk out?

1490
01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:31,553
Did l say l like her?

1491
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:35,822
You were ogling at her like
hell every day!

1492
01:37:35,997 --> 01:37:39,797
Father, switch off your mood
and listen to me carefully.

1493
01:37:42,503 --> 01:37:44,835
The girl l like is different but
seeing a different girl.

1494
01:37:45,473 --> 01:37:47,668
l want to do something but
doing something else.

1495
01:37:48,142 --> 01:37:49,575
Do you know how my situation is!

1496
01:37:49,744 --> 01:37:53,840
My life has been hauled,
mauled like hell!

1497
01:37:54,015 --> 01:37:57,576
ln the bad mood l'm now in, give me
your gun and leave me in Pakistan,

1498
01:37:57,752 --> 01:37:59,219
l'll settle things once for all
in 30 minutes.

1499
01:37:59,387 --> 01:38:04,324
What's your problem, son?

1500
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,252
Didn't get it yet?

1501
01:38:08,663 --> 01:38:10,062
l love a girl, father.

1502
01:38:15,169 --> 01:38:15,794
But...

1503
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:20,237
But how much l try she's not
responding to me.

1504
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:23,675
Any girl l see appears like her.

1505
01:38:23,945 --> 01:38:25,173
What should l do now, father?

1506
01:38:26,647 --> 01:38:29,616
Don't worry about her parents' rejections,

1507
01:38:30,618 --> 01:38:32,449
whether you're there in her heart or not,

1508
01:38:33,721 --> 01:38:34,813
know that first!

1509
01:38:40,695 --> 01:38:41,821
Your fianc's phone call.

1510
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:44,295
He's waiting in coffee shop downstairs.

1511
01:38:44,465 --> 01:38:47,298
He has ordered cappuccino for you,
he wants you there quickly.

1512
01:39:01,816 --> 01:39:02,840
Greetings, doctor.

1513
01:39:09,323 --> 01:39:10,347
Don't take my goodness...

1514
01:39:10,524 --> 01:39:16,952
Use it thrice a day with a glass o
water, milk or butter milk...

1515
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:20,866
Don't take it easily.
lf l get angry...

1516
01:39:21,035 --> 01:39:22,127
Operation is unavoidable.

1517
01:39:22,336 --> 01:39:24,065
lt'll cost Rs.1 .5 lakhs.

1518
01:39:25,506 --> 01:39:28,703
You've eyes to see, mouth to speak,

1519
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:30,241
good sense of dressing,

1520
01:39:30,411 --> 01:39:31,901
you've money to pay for your coffee,

1521
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:32,511
what happened to your brain?

1522
01:39:33,247 --> 01:39:33,872
No!

1523
01:39:35,683 --> 01:39:37,082
lt's not seen even in X-ray.

1524
01:39:41,422 --> 01:39:43,287
What? Are you making fun of me?

1525
01:39:43,457 --> 01:39:48,986
No, you're shouting at him for your anger,
l'm treating him for his piles.

1526
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:54,767
Coffee should be sipped not
to be thrown on coats.

1527
01:39:54,935 --> 01:39:57,995
Treat patients in clinic not
in coffee shops.

1528
01:40:00,408 --> 01:40:03,275
Sai, don't ever try to play your
cheap dirty tricks on me.

1529
01:40:03,444 --> 01:40:06,936
Will you call me here by claiming
you're my fianc in office?

1530
01:40:11,852 --> 01:40:15,788
Lakshmi, l was waiting for you outside,
what are you doing inside?

1531
01:40:19,226 --> 01:40:21,285
Shouting at me your habit, right?
Go ahead.

1532
01:41:01,235 --> 01:41:02,224
Brother, come here.

1533
01:41:02,937 --> 01:41:04,165
What did they order?

1534
01:41:05,339 --> 01:41:07,500
Does soup suit his face?
- No, sir.

1535
01:41:08,342 --> 01:41:09,502
What will you get if you serve him?

1536
01:41:09,677 --> 01:41:11,542
l'll get Rs.10000 salary
as l get every month.

1537
01:41:11,712 --> 01:41:13,612
lf you pour soup on him.
- Rs.20000 loss, sir.

1538
01:41:13,781 --> 01:41:16,045
Why?
- l need 2 months to find a new job.

1539
01:41:16,217 --> 01:41:19,015
l'm planning to give you Rs.20000
a month till you find a new job.

1540
01:41:19,186 --> 01:41:20,016
What do you say?

1541
01:41:22,189 --> 01:41:24,783
How is aunty? What else?

1542
01:41:27,862 --> 01:41:29,955
Serve soup on table not on my dress.

1543
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:33,362
Soup is very hot, sir.

1544
01:41:38,973 --> 01:41:40,270
l'll meet you later.

1545
01:41:55,656 --> 01:41:59,114
Without playing drama
come to the point straight.

1546
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:02,127
Okay, whether l'm in your heart or not.

1547
01:42:02,863 --> 01:42:06,094
l'm repeating it again.
Am l there in your heart or not?

1548
01:42:06,267 --> 01:42:07,131
No.

1549
01:42:07,435 --> 01:42:08,766
No!
- ls it?

1550
01:42:09,637 --> 01:42:12,572
Then, why did you hug me
in village that day?

1551
01:42:13,007 --> 01:42:15,874
lt happened unwittingly because
of emotional situation.

1552
01:42:16,043 --> 01:42:17,510
But my life went to dogs
with that incident.

1553
01:42:17,678 --> 01:42:18,940
l don't know that.

1554
01:42:19,113 --> 01:42:22,048
Would you've hugged anyone
in that situation?

1555
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:29,783
lt proves l'm there in your heart.

1556
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:31,250
l said no.

1557
01:42:32,293 --> 01:42:35,922
l've the incident in village
to prove l'm there.

1558
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:38,798
But what proof have you got
to prove l'm not there?

1559
01:42:38,966 --> 01:42:41,230
How will you prove that
l'm not in your heart?

1560
01:42:41,368 --> 01:42:43,165
l'll prove as you like.

1561
01:42:50,878 --> 01:42:53,870
Okay, let's hug just like that day.

1562
01:42:54,448 --> 01:42:58,350
lf l don't get the same feelings
l had then,

1563
01:42:58,552 --> 01:43:01,453
if feelings between us don't create
any sensation,

1564
01:43:01,622 --> 01:43:04,716
if l feel you don't have any feeling for me,

1565
01:43:04,892 --> 01:43:05,950
to tell you harshly,

1566
01:43:06,126 --> 01:43:07,457
if you don't get tempted,

1567
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:09,992
l'll never again disturb you in life.

1568
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:14,362
lf l've any feeling that you still
have a feeling for me,

1569
01:43:14,568 --> 01:43:16,001
l'll never leave you!

1570
01:43:16,570 --> 01:43:18,800
What the hell are you saying?
Do you know that?

1571
01:43:19,473 --> 01:43:21,634
As time passes,
you're become more stupid.

1572
01:43:21,809 --> 01:43:24,573
Will you hug me again?

1573
01:43:25,379 --> 01:43:26,505
You've gone mad.

1574
01:43:26,747 --> 01:43:28,112
Join a mental asylum.

1575
01:43:35,256 --> 01:43:38,316
Are you scared of falling to temptation?

1576
01:43:38,926 --> 01:43:41,224
l'll chase you, l'll scare you.

1577
01:43:41,962 --> 01:43:42,860
l'll bring you to my way!

1578
01:44:04,718 --> 01:44:13,683
Come to my home, my dear...
Come to my home...

1579
01:44:24,738 --> 01:44:29,300
As daughter-in-law to my parents...

1580
01:44:29,443 --> 01:44:33,880
As sister-in-law to
my younger brother and sister...

1581
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:39,543
Doors to my heart would open as you
step into the home with your right leg...

1582
01:45:20,761 --> 01:45:25,255
Keep your purse safely from thieves...

1583
01:45:25,432 --> 01:45:30,131
When the boy you love seeks,
don't hide your heart...

1584
01:45:30,304 --> 01:45:35,071
We can stop gushing waters
with a lock...

1585
01:45:35,242 --> 01:45:39,906
We can never hide love
how much ever you may try to...

1586
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:44,881
Lift your head, look into my eyes once...

1587
01:45:45,052 --> 01:45:49,785
Why are you so adamant?
Don't you want a companion?

1588
01:45:49,957 --> 01:45:53,120
Enough of frowning and making faces...

1589
01:46:12,346 --> 01:46:17,045
How beautiful you are
even when angry...

1590
01:46:17,217 --> 01:46:21,813
Once l become your dot,
l'll never leave you...

1591
01:46:21,989 --> 01:46:26,688
You disturbed my sleep
and moreover scolding me...

1592
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:31,695
My heart is in pain and thrilled...

1593
01:46:31,865 --> 01:46:36,529
Why are you terrorizing me
like Goddess Mahakali?

1594
01:46:36,737 --> 01:46:41,504
l'll make you my queen,
give me your heart...

1595
01:46:41,675 --> 01:46:44,667
l'm Do Re Mi,
you're my Pa So...

1596
01:47:08,702 --> 01:47:11,068
Do you've concepts in love proposal too?

1597
01:47:11,572 --> 01:47:13,699
Non-veg thoughts are not good.

1598
01:47:13,874 --> 01:47:15,535
Can you flatter a girl with just one hug?

1599
01:47:15,709 --> 01:47:19,440
She hates you so much,
why are you after her?

1600
01:47:20,047 --> 01:47:23,881
Sister, Lakshmi is just a colleague to you.
At the most a friend.

1601
01:47:24,051 --> 01:47:25,643
But she's my angel.

1602
01:47:26,286 --> 01:47:29,153
lt's so good when she hates me,
what if she loves me?

1603
01:47:29,323 --> 01:47:30,085
l'll go mad!

1604
01:47:30,257 --> 01:47:31,246
Don't go that far.

1605
01:47:31,425 --> 01:47:32,983
l too felt like that only.

1606
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:34,718
l thought she's not in my life.

1607
01:47:36,563 --> 01:47:38,588
The moment l came to know
l'm there in her heart,

1608
01:47:38,799 --> 01:47:39,823
l decided that moment itself.

1609
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,093
lt was okay then, it could've been,

1610
01:47:42,269 --> 01:47:43,566
but now she says you're not in her heart.

1611
01:47:43,737 --> 01:47:46,262
lf God gives a struggling his
number to call,

1612
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:47,634
will you give a missed call?

1613
01:47:48,842 --> 01:47:49,570
This also like that only.

1614
01:47:50,110 --> 01:47:54,240
l don't know if wealthy and powerful
people are happy in life or not, sister.

1615
01:47:54,414 --> 01:47:57,906
But one who has a good life partner
will be happy all his life.

1616
01:47:58,485 --> 01:48:01,249
Didn't you find any other angel than her?

1617
01:48:02,756 --> 01:48:04,781
We build a temple for Goddess.

1618
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:06,585
We don't go in search of Goddess
after building temple.

1619
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:07,920
l've already decided.

1620
01:48:08,095 --> 01:48:10,529
But you must think from her
point of view also, right?

1621
01:48:10,697 --> 01:48:11,664
Bloody point of view.

1622
01:48:11,865 --> 01:48:16,029
She'll reject Shahjahan who built Taj Mahal
and marry a mason selected by her father.

1623
01:48:16,303 --> 01:48:18,032
Sister, advice me as your brother,

1624
01:48:18,205 --> 01:48:19,331
when l'm preparing for lAS,

1625
01:48:19,506 --> 01:48:21,531
will you push me to work hard
and encourage me or not?

1626
01:48:21,842 --> 01:48:23,434
Why don't you encourage me now?

1627
01:48:24,444 --> 01:48:27,777
This is like lAS to me,
l'll try hard and succeed.

1628
01:48:27,981 --> 01:48:29,846
Leave me, sister.
- l beg you!

1629
01:48:30,184 --> 01:48:33,449
You can talk to get anyone's
support in 10 minutes.

1630
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:36,851
Forget about me leaving you,
l request you both to leave me alone.

1631
01:49:02,716 --> 01:49:03,410
Come.

1632
01:49:04,084 --> 01:49:04,812
What happened?

1633
01:49:04,985 --> 01:49:06,976
l'll find from her and tell you, father.
You go inside.

1634
01:49:09,389 --> 01:49:10,720
l want to talk to you.

1635
01:49:11,358 --> 01:49:12,256
Okay, let's go to my home.

1636
01:49:12,426 --> 01:49:13,290
Would you like to have coffee or tea?

1637
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:15,519
Would anyone have coffee
and tea at this hour?

1638
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:18,660
Usually l'll have drinks.

1639
01:49:20,734 --> 01:49:22,258
What did you say with Pavithra?

1640
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:28,198
Nothing, asked if she knows anyone
who can lend Rs.3 lakhs @ 30/0 interest.

1641
01:49:28,375 --> 01:49:29,364
Did she ask you?

1642
01:49:29,543 --> 01:49:31,704
l didn't mean about your interest.

1643
01:49:31,879 --> 01:49:33,710
About your concept you told her.

1644
01:49:33,947 --> 01:49:37,747
lf God gives a struggling man
to call in distress,

1645
01:49:37,951 --> 01:49:39,213
should we call till God responds our call?

1646
01:49:40,153 --> 01:49:42,883
Am l acting with some
ulterior motive inside?

1647
01:49:43,056 --> 01:49:45,854
Do women like us...

1648
01:49:47,761 --> 01:49:49,456
Don't we trust real love?

1649
01:49:50,397 --> 01:49:56,131
Do we women reject Shahjahan who built Taj Mahal
and marry a mason on father's advice.

1650
01:49:57,371 --> 01:49:59,669
You're not thinking of building
Taj Mahal for me, Sai.

1651
01:49:59,806 --> 01:50:02,866
You want to paint the Taj Mahal
already built and use it.

1652
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:07,310
lf l hug you once,
can you find whether l love you or not?

1653
01:50:08,048 --> 01:50:12,883
Not just once but l'll give you chance for
3 times 3 days and 3 hours!

1654
01:50:13,053 --> 01:50:16,716
Prove in these three chances
if l love you or not.

1655
01:50:17,357 --> 01:50:19,086
lf you fail to prove it,

1656
01:50:19,259 --> 01:50:23,423
either get your father transferred from
here or delete me from your memory.

1657
01:50:23,597 --> 01:50:27,158
3 chances! Decide date time and
place and send me SMS.

1658
01:50:30,237 --> 01:50:34,071
Not for having feeling for you
or liking your concept.

1659
01:50:34,274 --> 01:50:35,502
To get rid of you.

1660
01:51:02,002 --> 01:51:03,799
He sent message at 6 am.

1661
01:51:03,971 --> 01:51:06,940
Recently we got a couple married right?
His friend.

1662
01:51:07,107 --> 01:51:08,438
lt seems they've left for Tirupati.

1663
01:51:08,608 --> 01:51:09,939
He has fixed program in their home.

1664
01:51:10,177 --> 01:51:13,806
l challenged him in a burst of anger.
But l feel shy to go.

1665
01:51:14,014 --> 01:51:17,347
Please talk to him and
get this bet cancelled.

1666
01:51:17,818 --> 01:51:18,614
Look there!

1667
01:51:21,221 --> 01:51:25,214
You called him at 7.30 pm
but he's here at 7.30 am.

1668
01:51:28,962 --> 01:51:29,587
Come.

1669
01:51:31,298 --> 01:51:31,957
Come.

1670
01:51:46,747 --> 01:51:49,238
Sister-in-law, brother told me
to give this key to you.

1671
01:51:53,253 --> 01:51:55,153
What sort of a man he is?
- Any man is like that.

1672
01:51:55,322 --> 01:51:56,812
lf you chance
would he leave it easily?

1673
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:59,254
Take bath evening and go to meet him.

1674
01:51:59,426 --> 01:52:01,189
Will you also join me?

1675
01:52:01,595 --> 01:52:03,654
Are you going to night show film?

1676
01:52:26,853 --> 01:52:28,184
What are these feelings?

1677
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:31,418
l never had such feelings.

1678
01:52:35,028 --> 01:52:40,625
Did l challenge him in anger
or did l do it wantonly?

1679
01:52:42,402 --> 01:52:43,630
Oh father!

1680
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:47,766
Somehow l must get rid of Sai.

1681
01:52:52,879 --> 01:52:55,439
But what's this feeling?

1682
01:52:56,216 --> 01:52:57,240
Why isn't it leaving me?

1683
01:52:58,418 --> 01:53:00,113
There's some magic in him.

1684
01:53:01,221 --> 01:53:04,213
ls he conducting any special prayers?

1685
01:53:05,358 --> 01:53:07,883
Lakshmi, control yourself.

1686
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:11,428
Under any circumstance,
don't give up your aim.

1687
01:54:07,787 --> 01:54:09,379
l'm here at the strike of 7.30 pm.

1688
01:54:37,284 --> 01:54:39,775
ls it my problem?
Why should l call him?

1689
01:54:39,986 --> 01:54:41,248
l'll not call him.

1690
01:54:41,488 --> 01:54:42,785
l'll not give a missed call also.

1691
01:54:52,332 --> 01:54:53,765
Why is he scaring me?

1692
01:55:05,812 --> 01:55:07,837
Why am l waiting for him?

1693
01:55:09,683 --> 01:55:12,447
lf l hadn't hugged him there
l wouldn't have faced any trouble.

1694
01:55:12,953 --> 01:55:14,011
lt was my mistake.

1695
01:55:16,022 --> 01:55:17,819
5 minutes grace period is also over.

1696
01:55:18,124 --> 01:55:21,389
Tomorrow he'll come saying love,
l'll take him to task.

1697
01:55:43,016 --> 01:55:44,108
No...

1698
01:55:44,618 --> 01:55:48,486
Just because he didn't touch you,
why are you stopping me also?

1699
01:55:48,955 --> 01:55:50,047
Will you shut your mouth?

1700
01:55:51,391 --> 01:55:55,487
l can understand your feelings.
- Why should l feel? Why?

1701
01:55:55,662 --> 01:55:58,825
He lost a chance, why do you pity me?
- lsn't it?

1702
01:55:59,833 --> 01:56:01,300
He lost a chance.

1703
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:03,901
He must feel sad and he must get angry.

1704
01:56:04,070 --> 01:56:07,597
You're feeling bad as if you expected
something and it didn't happen.

1705
01:56:08,842 --> 01:56:11,106
l feel embarrassed to wait and
come without meeting him.

1706
01:56:11,278 --> 01:56:14,076
As if he's Gabbar Singh and
you're embarrassed.

1707
01:56:14,247 --> 01:56:16,738
Okay, l'll do one thing.

1708
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:18,881
l'll arrange your second meeting.

1709
01:56:19,419 --> 01:56:23,150
lf he acts any smart this time,
l'll rip out his skin.

1710
01:56:23,356 --> 01:56:23,913
Okay?

1711
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:27,321
Please, get rid of him from my life.
l'll be ever grateful to you.

1712
01:56:27,494 --> 01:56:28,927
l'll get peace of mind.

1713
01:56:29,095 --> 01:56:32,326
Tomorrow evening program,
he'll come to pick you up.

1714
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:36,591
l'm getting bored, shall we talk our way?

1715
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:39,170
Watch the road and drive.
Someone may hit the car.

1716
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,338
This is one way.
- Yours too is one way.

1717
01:56:42,842 --> 01:56:44,104
l'll convey.

1718
01:56:51,951 --> 01:56:53,816
Will you please give Rs.20 worth jasmine?

1719
01:56:53,987 --> 01:56:56,285
Why are you buying jasmine?
Are you going crazy?

1720
01:56:56,456 --> 01:56:58,617
Shouldn't l keep jasmine also in car?

1721
01:56:58,792 --> 01:56:59,781
As freshener!

1722
01:57:00,193 --> 01:57:01,387
Take it, sir.

1723
01:57:01,828 --> 01:57:05,025
Hey you girl, what did you think?

1724
01:57:05,632 --> 01:57:08,795
Okay, if you want to use like that,
let's use it.

1725
01:57:12,806 --> 01:57:15,741
Our program is in Pavithra's house, right?
Will it be comfortable?

1726
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:39,091
Why did you stop near medial shop?

1727
01:57:39,232 --> 01:57:41,496
Nothing, looking for safety.
- Safety?

1728
01:57:41,901 --> 01:57:43,232
Yes, can't hold myself in that moment.

1729
01:57:43,436 --> 01:57:45,666
Something may happen,
it may be not with us when we need it.

1730
01:57:45,839 --> 01:57:46,771
We'll not stop because we don't have it.

1731
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:49,773
We'll go ahead and
regret for it after 3 months.

1732
01:57:49,943 --> 01:57:51,035
Safety is very important.

1733
01:57:51,211 --> 01:57:52,838
They show ad on TV also,
didn't you see it?

1734
01:57:53,346 --> 01:57:54,836
Wait, l'll get it.

1735
01:57:55,882 --> 01:57:58,180
You're doing too much.
l'll break your teeth.

1736
01:57:58,351 --> 01:58:00,342
Get going, forget about safety.

1737
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,454
You may not need but l do need it.

1738
01:58:02,622 --> 01:58:05,250
Are you mad?
- Yes, l'm going mad.

1739
01:58:05,458 --> 01:58:06,686
l'm dying with severe headache.

1740
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:08,885
l want to buy tablets for safety,
why are you stopping me?

1741
01:58:09,062 --> 01:58:10,962
l know what you want to buy?

1742
01:58:11,131 --> 01:58:12,860
What?
- Those things.

1743
01:58:13,032 --> 01:58:14,465
What do you mean by those things?

1744
01:58:14,834 --> 01:58:17,530
Those things.
- What are those things?

1745
01:58:17,704 --> 01:58:19,865
Okay, why would you get headache now?

1746
01:58:20,039 --> 01:58:23,634
l don't know why but when l get into
romantic mood l get headache.

1747
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:25,641
l'm always like this from childhood days.

1748
01:58:26,746 --> 01:58:28,907
Okay, l'll get it, what's the tablet?

1749
01:58:29,082 --> 01:58:33,314
When we add it to water,
it effervesces, Disprin!

1750
01:58:54,841 --> 01:58:56,502
Don't overact, get going.

1751
01:58:57,444 --> 01:58:58,502
Didn't he give change?

1752
01:59:05,752 --> 01:59:08,687
Where are you going at this hour?

1753
01:59:09,622 --> 01:59:11,021
My clothes have become dirty,

1754
01:59:11,191 --> 01:59:13,216
l want to wash clothes in Bhimli beach
and dry it in Ramakrishna beach.

1755
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:14,758
What did l tell you now?

1756
01:59:14,928 --> 01:59:18,921
Look, a girl must put motif in courtyard,
salt in curry, and bed in room.

1757
01:59:19,098 --> 01:59:21,191
They mustn't put questions like this,
you know.

1758
01:59:21,334 --> 01:59:21,959
Okay.

1759
01:59:22,135 --> 01:59:24,296
Where's your mother?
- She went to Khammam.

1760
01:59:24,504 --> 01:59:25,766
Khammam?

1761
01:59:25,939 --> 01:59:29,773
She went to attend core committee meeting of
Andhra-Telengana software Mothers-in-law.

1762
01:59:29,943 --> 01:59:30,932
She won't have beers in the
name of core meeting, right?

1763
01:59:31,110 --> 01:59:32,702
Nothing like that.

1764
01:59:33,112 --> 01:59:36,445
Just now she called, she wanted me
to take your updates.

1765
01:59:44,224 --> 01:59:45,350
Take a low angle also.

1766
01:59:48,661 --> 01:59:50,128
Status?

1767
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:51,961
Headline is Love Deal!

1768
01:59:52,131 --> 01:59:55,965
Tag line is Trend creating Subramanyam

1769
01:59:56,369 --> 01:59:57,631

01:59:57,804 --> 02:00:00,238
A sweet and soft love story
that impressed me.

1771

Who is it?

1772
02:00:01,307 --> 02:00:04,140
My friend's cousin's best friend's cousin!

1773
02:00:11,818 --> 02:00:12,807
l'll go now, bye.

1774
02:00:12,952 --> 02:00:14,112
When will you be back?

1775
02:00:14,287 --> 02:00:17,984
lf Potti Sriramulu's wife had asked him
when would he come back?

1776
02:00:18,157 --> 02:00:19,419
Would there be Andhra Pradesh now?

1777
02:00:19,926 --> 02:00:22,986
There mustn't be calculations and
expectations for agitations and philosophies.

1778
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:24,592
This looks great!

1779
02:00:24,764 --> 02:00:26,391
Post it in Whatsapp and say hats off.

1780
02:00:31,838 --> 02:00:33,669
ls your shopping over?

1781
02:00:37,277 --> 02:00:41,008
Can we come now?
- He left just now, come quickly.

1782
02:00:42,215 --> 02:00:43,239
Did she ask us to come?

1783
02:00:52,392 --> 02:00:53,450
Why are you laughing?

1784
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:56,419
Nothing....come.

1785
02:01:04,370 --> 02:01:07,305
Subramanyam may come at any time.
That's the room.

1786
02:01:16,349 --> 02:01:17,646
Why did you slap him?

1787
02:01:18,051 --> 02:01:20,281
l pulled to warn you
but why did you slap him?

1788
02:01:21,087 --> 02:01:22,714
You're going inside, is it okay?

1789
02:01:28,227 --> 02:01:31,390
Sister, can you get me some water?
- What will you do with water inside?

1790
02:01:31,564 --> 02:01:33,429
l'll sprinkle it on hot iron,
you got me slapped too.

1791
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:34,726
Get water, sister.

1792
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:48,909
Why are you closing the door?

1793
02:01:51,584 --> 02:01:53,176
Why are you opening the door?

1794
02:01:53,586 --> 02:01:55,076
You want me to open or close?

1795
02:01:57,256 --> 02:01:58,018
Close it

1796
02:02:36,562 --> 02:02:39,463

What happened?

1800
02:03:55,875 --> 02:03:58,901
ls it wrong to fall in love?

1801
02:03:59,145 --> 02:04:01,875
You said you were going out to deal
an interesting love story.

1802
02:04:02,048 --> 02:04:03,879
Not interesting love story
but irritating love story.

1803
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:06,348
How can two men love each other?

1804
02:04:06,552 --> 02:04:08,042
Are two men lovers?

1805
02:04:08,354 --> 02:04:09,150
Shall l upload it in Facebook?

1806
02:04:09,322 --> 02:04:11,017
l'll stamp you to death, get me water.

1807
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:13,055
No...
- Get me water.

1808
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,559
Want me to upload in Facebook?

1809
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:28,902
lt's Sai's phone.

1810
02:04:32,378 --> 02:04:33,902
Will you blackmail me?

1811
02:04:37,784 --> 02:04:38,751
Watch now!

1812
02:04:39,085 --> 02:04:40,609

1813
02:04:45,758 --> 02:04:47,419
Come.

1814
02:04:57,804 --> 02:04:58,862
Who is inside?

1815
02:04:59,806 --> 02:05:02,366
Lakshmi is working inside.

1816
02:05:02,675 --> 02:05:05,405
She's working inside and
you're reading paper here.

1817
02:05:06,779 --> 02:05:10,215
Sai too is inside.
- Sai too? What is he doing?

1818
02:05:10,817 --> 02:05:13,786
They both are having a private conversation.

1819
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:18,789
When they're having private conversation,
are you helping love with social service?

1820
02:05:18,958 --> 02:05:19,947
Call him.

1821
02:05:20,626 --> 02:05:21,456
No...

1822
02:05:21,627 --> 02:05:22,855
First call them out.

1823
02:05:23,029 --> 02:05:25,293
Poor things.
- Poor things?

1824
02:05:31,204 --> 02:05:33,536
Someone is here, open the door.

1825
02:05:35,808 --> 02:05:36,399
Who is it?

Brother-in-law?
- What brother-in-law?

1828
02:05:41,647 --> 02:05:42,636
Are you playing smart wit me?
- Stop, brother-in-law.

1829
02:05:42,815 --> 02:05:44,305
Why are you calling me brother-in-law?

1830
02:05:44,483 --> 02:05:45,313
You're doing too much.

1831
02:05:45,484 --> 02:05:47,543
Sai, your time is over.

1832
02:05:50,323 --> 02:05:51,187
Good riddance!

1833
02:05:51,357 --> 02:05:52,483
Brother-in-law, l've your video with me.

You went overboard.
- Deleted it?

1837
02:06:01,434 --> 02:06:01,991
Deleted it.

1838
02:06:02,168 --> 02:06:03,294
Brother-in-law!
- What brother-in-law?

1839
02:06:03,469 --> 02:06:05,164
lf l see you here again,
l'll blow up your head.

1840
02:06:05,338 --> 02:06:06,327
Brother-in-law!

1841
02:06:08,674 --> 02:06:09,436
Mashed mutton is ready.

1842
02:06:12,278 --> 02:06:13,745
Those who want it, stand in separate line.

1843
02:06:18,584 --> 02:06:19,107
Mother-in-law!

1844
02:06:19,452 --> 02:06:20,441
Won't you give me that?

1845
02:06:35,635 --> 02:06:44,873
Stop, mother-in-law!
- Stop!

1846
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:09,334
Mother!
- Stop!

1847
02:07:09,669 --> 02:07:12,160
lt's not sin even to kill you.
- Stop, mother.

1848
02:07:12,338 --> 02:07:14,636
See, how your mother is thrashing me.

1849
02:07:14,774 --> 02:07:17,743
What's this mother?
Are you hitting software Subramanyam?

1850
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:20,504
ls he software Subramanyam?
My foot!

1851
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:22,739
He's mashed mutton specialist
in a mutton shop.

1852
02:07:22,915 --> 02:07:23,438
Mashed mutton specialist?

1853
02:07:23,616 --> 02:07:27,416
This fool cheated you and me!

1854
02:07:28,154 --> 02:07:31,681
Why did you leave software job
to work in mutton shop?

1855
02:07:31,824 --> 02:07:34,725
l lost my job in recession.
Unable to decide what to do...

1856
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:37,260
lf you lose job,
you should've joined as driver.

1857
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:39,625
Why did you work in a mutton shop?

1858
02:07:39,799 --> 02:07:40,766
My father had a mutton shop.

1859
02:07:40,933 --> 02:07:44,926
When you said you love him, you said his
father too was software engineer.

1860
02:07:45,104 --> 02:07:46,435
You told me like that, right?

1861
02:07:46,605 --> 02:07:47,970
l said my father is MS.

1862
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:49,368
MS means mutton shop, right?

1863
02:07:49,542 --> 02:07:51,806
She mistook it for MS office,
how can l be responsible for it?

1864
02:07:51,978 --> 02:07:54,446
How many lies you've reeled out?

1865
02:07:54,613 --> 02:07:58,140
Mother, stop!

1866
02:07:58,718 --> 02:08:03,121
Okay, l'll get him some job
with people l know. Okay?

1867
02:08:03,289 --> 02:08:04,950
Which job?
- Software.

1868
02:08:05,124 --> 02:08:06,682
Okay, do it properly.

1869
02:08:06,826 --> 02:08:11,388
lf you go to mutton shop again,
l'll make mashed meat of you.

1870
02:08:11,564 --> 02:08:12,462
You carry on, mother-in-law.

1871
02:08:24,143 --> 02:08:26,407
Miss Lakshmi Anand!

1872
02:08:27,213 --> 02:08:28,305
Come here, dear.

1873
02:08:28,447 --> 02:08:30,039
Father!
- Come here.

1874
02:08:46,032 --> 02:08:47,090
What happened, dad?

1875
02:08:47,233 --> 02:08:49,167
Father.
- l'm happy.

1876
02:08:53,606 --> 02:08:55,836
Most important stage in
my daughter's marriage.

1877
02:08:59,478 --> 02:09:02,504
See them, select the best one you like.
l'll fix it.

1878
02:09:03,015 --> 02:09:06,473
What's this new habit, dad?
Whatever you like is my choice.

1879
02:09:06,652 --> 02:09:08,176
You select for me.

1880
02:09:08,354 --> 02:09:13,621
You say like that?
Okay, we liked this very much.

1881
02:09:13,793 --> 02:09:15,624
How is it?
- Okay, dad.

1882
02:09:16,028 --> 02:09:17,928
l'm getting late to office, shall l go?

1883
02:09:20,666 --> 02:09:23,191
Wait a minute, please.

1884
02:09:29,608 --> 02:09:31,473
Why are you thanking me, dad?

1885
02:09:31,644 --> 02:09:32,702
l must thank you.

1886
02:09:32,878 --> 02:09:39,374
Every father would wish to thank
his daughter in such times.

1887
02:09:39,552 --> 02:09:43,886
But he misses to say in the busy
work of conducting the marriage.

1888
02:09:45,057 --> 02:09:51,462
For a father like me raising a son to
become a successful man is not a big deal.

1889
02:09:51,964 --> 02:09:54,455
But raising a daughter,
getting her good education,

1890
02:09:54,633 --> 02:09:55,895
raise her into a young woman,

1891
02:09:56,068 --> 02:09:59,333
getting her married to a man
without any bad remark,

1892
02:10:00,673 --> 02:10:03,574
it is very great achievement
in these modern times.

1893
02:10:03,742 --> 02:10:05,573
Such father would 100 out of 100!

1894
02:10:06,112 --> 02:10:07,739
l'm scoring 100 marks in this.

1895
02:10:11,117 --> 02:10:15,577
This is not my credit but
it's your complete support.

1896
02:10:17,022 --> 02:10:19,183
Thanks brings to my memory.

1897
02:10:19,358 --> 02:10:20,757
Another one, where's the cover?

1898
02:10:20,926 --> 02:10:21,483
Father.

1899
02:10:22,928 --> 02:10:23,519
Take it.

1900
02:10:24,163 --> 02:10:25,687
What's this?
- Rs.1 lakh.

1901
02:10:26,298 --> 02:10:28,266
Why?
- A small gift.

1902
02:10:30,035 --> 02:10:32,595
l can give any as gift to you
personally now only.

1903
02:10:32,838 --> 02:10:37,969
lf l give anything after marriage,
it belongs to your husband and ln-laws too.

1904
02:10:38,144 --> 02:10:39,270
Remember that.

1905
02:10:39,745 --> 02:10:44,114
Along with this gift, take this car key also.

1906
02:10:44,283 --> 02:10:47,719
Go anywhere you want to and
buy anything you wish.

1907
02:10:48,053 --> 02:10:49,714
Your wish only, don't ask anyone's opinion.

1908
02:10:49,889 --> 02:10:52,949
Take leave from office,
till evening....

1909
02:10:55,461 --> 02:10:57,622
Thanks, dad.
- Go...go my dear,.

1910
02:10:58,697 --> 02:11:01,723
No need to make an entry where
you're going in the register also.

1911
02:11:01,901 --> 02:11:02,959
As you wish!

1912
02:11:26,025 --> 02:11:27,993
Today is aunt's birthday.

1913
02:11:46,011 --> 02:11:46,705
How do you do?

1914
02:11:47,813 --> 02:11:48,780
l'm not fine.

1915
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:52,039
This smile?

1916
02:11:52,952 --> 02:11:55,352
Flowers keep smiling even
when they get plucked.

1917
02:11:55,821 --> 02:11:56,913
Me too like that.

1918
02:11:58,891 --> 02:12:00,916
Okay aunt, l'll come to the point directly.

1919
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:04,457
Laila-Majnu, Salim-Anarkali,
Shahjahan-Taj Mahal,

1920
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:06,791
all these are nothing,
l don't know them,

1921
02:12:07,032 --> 02:12:11,025
there's only one love l've seen
and met in my life.

1922
02:12:11,937 --> 02:12:13,598
Devika...l mean you!

1923
02:12:15,140 --> 02:12:18,940
People pray in distress.
l'm praying to you.

1924
02:12:19,211 --> 02:12:20,701
My love is surviving on ventilators.

1925
02:12:21,447 --> 02:12:23,108
ln a situation of unable
\ to get oxygen also.,

1926
02:12:25,217 --> 02:12:26,309
You must save it.

1927
02:12:27,319 --> 02:12:29,480
My love is the most selfish love
in this world.

1928
02:12:30,055 --> 02:12:35,254
As selfish as farmer looking
at sky wishing it rains,

1929
02:12:35,427 --> 02:12:37,827
my wish of getting Lakshmi is also so selfish.

1930
02:12:38,731 --> 02:12:46,069
When l come from office in future,
l wish the girl l love opens the door to me.

1931
02:12:46,372 --> 02:12:50,172
Whether it is tears or her, decide yourself.

1932
02:12:55,147 --> 02:12:58,913
Look, l don't know whether
to get angry or pity you!

1933
02:12:59,084 --> 02:13:00,517
Neither you can get angry nor pity me!

1934
02:13:00,686 --> 02:13:02,085
You don't have both for me.

1935
02:13:02,254 --> 02:13:03,915
There's only one thing, that is love.

1936
02:13:04,456 --> 02:13:05,423
You won't express it.

1937
02:13:05,591 --> 02:13:06,853
Don't talk like a stupid.

1938
02:13:07,459 --> 02:13:08,983
Wedding cards are also ready.

1939
02:13:09,795 --> 02:13:11,160
What's this like a mad man?

1940
02:13:11,864 --> 02:13:16,563
Sai, you're a good man,
like aunt said happiness in pant and shirt.

1941
02:13:16,735 --> 02:13:18,430
Don't ruin your life unnecessarily.

1942
02:13:18,604 --> 02:13:21,801
Do you know what your problem is?
lt's me!

1943
02:13:21,974 --> 02:13:23,669
Remove me from your heart.

1944
02:13:25,110 --> 02:13:26,270
You can't bear when l get married.

1945
02:13:26,745 --> 02:13:28,212
You've good future.

1946
02:13:28,447 --> 02:13:31,177
l'm sure a good girl would be there for you.

1947
02:13:31,884 --> 02:13:33,715
Do you know why l'm telling you this!

1948
02:13:33,886 --> 02:13:34,978
You must be fine.

1949
02:13:35,154 --> 02:13:38,783
lf you're fine, l'll be the first
person to be happy.

1950
02:13:48,667 --> 02:13:50,032
Wait.
- Tell me.

1951
02:13:50,169 --> 02:13:54,162
Girls like you have plenty of emotions when
necessary and quotations when not needed.

1952
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:55,671
But l still have a chance.

1953
02:13:55,841 --> 02:13:59,675
As you promised, l wish to use
my third chance here.

1954
02:14:01,213 --> 02:14:04,580
Air, water, earth here knows you love me.

1955
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:06,217
Except you!

1956
02:14:06,418 --> 02:14:13,824
l tried to forget you but l came to know,
l was trying to kill myself not forget.

1957
02:14:14,493 --> 02:14:19,487
There are many social networks
to express my feelings.

1958
02:14:20,666 --> 02:14:25,603
But to express honest feelings,
you need a clean heart.

1959
02:14:26,605 --> 02:14:28,766
With the same heart l'm expressing my love.

1960
02:14:56,802 --> 02:14:59,202
Are girls like this only?

1961
02:14:59,371 --> 02:15:01,532
You camouflage emotions very well.

1962
02:15:02,141 --> 02:15:03,631
People compare women with earth.

1963
02:15:03,809 --> 02:15:04,833
But it is wrong.

1964
02:15:05,010 --> 02:15:07,478
There's gold, diamonds, petrol and
many things inside earth.

1965
02:15:07,646 --> 02:15:09,204
lf we find it, we can unearth it.

1966
02:15:09,381 --> 02:15:13,215
But even if we know there love,
we can get it out.

1967
02:15:15,621 --> 02:15:18,055
Hugging you is like hugging a rock.

1968
02:15:19,024 --> 02:15:21,492
You've build a wall between
your heart and your love.

1969
02:15:22,294 --> 02:15:23,989
Live all your life behind that wall.

1970
02:15:25,631 --> 02:15:28,930
lt's beastly to touch women
who dislikes you.

1971
02:15:29,101 --> 02:15:31,262
For touching you though you hate me,

1972
02:15:31,670 --> 02:15:32,659
please forgive me.

1973
02:15:33,405 --> 02:15:34,133
Go away.

1974
02:16:38,804 --> 02:16:43,901
This is the last hug for both of us.

1975
02:16:47,145 --> 02:16:49,978
There's no chance of talking
about this in my life.

1976
02:17:02,728 --> 02:17:03,695
What's this hell?

1977
02:17:04,663 --> 02:17:06,688
Will you squeeze and stamp my heart?

1978
02:17:07,132 --> 02:17:08,759
Will you take me to the end and dump?

1979
02:17:10,102 --> 02:17:12,161
lt's like topping state in lnter
and failing in EAMCET.

1980
02:17:15,841 --> 02:17:19,937
Won't you see love in my heart?

1981
02:17:20,112 --> 02:17:26,517
Though l'm praying fervently,
will you do as you wish?

1982
02:17:36,962 --> 02:17:41,956
l was living in imaginations
with you as my other half...

1983
02:17:42,134 --> 02:17:47,538
l'm giving my half which is
without you to yourself...

1984
02:17:47,706 --> 02:17:52,541
Do whatever you want to do with it...

1985
02:18:24,343 --> 02:18:34,184
My heart never asked to
get this thing and that thing...

1986
02:18:37,456 --> 02:18:47,331
First time it made a wish to get you...

1987
02:18:47,833 --> 02:18:52,861
l promised it that you won't say
no to me...

1988
02:18:53,038 --> 02:18:57,532
What am l to tell my heart now?

1989
02:18:58,210 --> 02:19:03,273
My tears are drowning me furiously...

1990
02:19:03,448 --> 02:19:07,782
What would become of me?

1991
02:19:39,518 --> 02:19:40,746
Please don't cry son.

1992
02:19:42,421 --> 02:19:43,911
l can't bear it, son.

1993
02:19:50,495 --> 02:19:53,259
l can console if son fails in exam.

1994
02:19:53,398 --> 02:19:56,390
l can console son failing in business.

1995
02:19:56,535 --> 02:20:02,405
But l don't know how to console a son
who failed in his love.

1996
02:20:04,009 --> 02:20:06,842
Not only me, no mother knows that.

1997
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:10,512
Please don't cry, my son.

1998
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:14,014
l can't bear to see you in tears.

1999
02:20:19,391 --> 02:20:22,690
Do it quickly, marriage isn't a week away
but today evening.

2000
02:20:22,961 --> 02:20:24,360
You may fall down.

2001
02:20:24,529 --> 02:20:27,396
Did you call the grooms' people?
Have they left or not?

2002
02:20:27,566 --> 02:20:29,693
Not yet, father.
- Do it.- l will.

2003
02:20:33,872 --> 02:20:35,601
Hubby, water.

2004
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:42,573
What's this? lt's daughter's marriage,
mother must be bright with happiness.

2005
02:20:42,748 --> 02:20:44,306
Why are you dull?

2006
02:20:44,583 --> 02:20:45,607
Come here.

2007
02:20:45,817 --> 02:20:50,777
Hubby, our daughter is missing,
she was seen 5 minutes ago.

2008
02:20:50,956 --> 02:20:52,548
l suspect something.

2009
02:21:03,735 --> 02:21:05,669
Bring him wherever he may be!

2010
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:33,363
What did we do wring with you?

2011
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,034
Though you were caught red handed,
spared because l didn't want to ruin your future.

2012
02:21:39,871 --> 02:21:42,965
Even a snake will bite
only if we stamp on it,

2013
02:21:44,042 --> 02:21:46,408
Whatever l may tell or do,
you'll never get sense.

2014
02:21:46,678 --> 02:21:49,613
lt has become fashion for you boys
to humiliate parents' in marriage halls.

2015
02:21:49,881 --> 02:21:52,611
Tell me, where have you taken my daughter?

2016
02:21:52,784 --> 02:21:53,944
Leave me, uncle.

2017
02:21:55,387 --> 02:21:58,481
ls that why they brought me
here hitting all the way?

2018
02:21:58,657 --> 02:21:59,555
For what else?

2019
02:23:37,589 --> 02:23:39,489
What's your arrogance?
- Nothing, uncle.

2020
02:23:39,791 --> 02:23:42,658
When they were hitting me,
l didn't react fearing l may be wrong.

2021
02:23:43,161 --> 02:23:45,561
After coming here, l realised
l've done nothing wrong.

2022
02:23:45,730 --> 02:23:47,994
That's why l repaid them.

2023
02:23:48,166 --> 02:23:49,656
Didn't you do anything wrong?

2024
02:23:49,801 --> 02:23:51,894
Did l take your daughter with me?

2025
02:23:52,504 --> 02:23:54,472
Not just girls, even boys can forget.

2026
02:23:54,639 --> 02:23:55,663
But it'll cost a full bottle.

2027
02:23:55,807 --> 02:23:56,967
l did spend, l forgot her.

2028
02:23:57,142 --> 02:24:00,578
Boys too can make their
parents happy like girls.

2029
02:24:00,812 --> 02:24:04,509
l asked my father,
what should l do to make him happy?

2030
02:24:04,816 --> 02:24:06,113
He said marry!

2031
02:24:07,252 --> 02:24:10,085
NRl proposal,
Rs.4 crores dowry with green card.

2032
02:24:10,255 --> 02:24:13,281
Just before l tied the knot,
your daughter came and asked me, uncle.

2033
02:24:16,695 --> 02:24:17,821
What about me then?

2034
02:24:22,434 --> 02:24:25,335
They shouted at me and
spat on my face before leaving.

2035
02:24:30,108 --> 02:24:33,305
You gave birth to her and raised her
for 20 years yet you didn't know,

2036
02:24:33,678 --> 02:24:36,112
that your daughter will leave home
5 minutes before her marriage,

2037
02:24:36,481 --> 02:24:37,880
How can l know about it, uncle?

2038
02:24:38,249 --> 02:24:40,843
lf we know we would fall for a girl
somewhere some day,

2039
02:24:41,052 --> 02:24:43,714
we'll never go to that place on
that particular day, uncle.

2040
02:24:43,855 --> 02:24:46,824
You raised your daughter for 20 years.

2041
02:24:46,992 --> 02:24:50,291
l struggled a year to make
her fall in love with me.

2042
02:24:50,562 --> 02:24:54,225
You wrote in your diary about
raising your son,

2043
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:57,493
they'll keep on rejecting parents
for every little thing,

2044
02:24:57,669 --> 02:25:02,038
but they always leave the most
important decisions to parents.

2045
02:25:02,841 --> 02:25:04,240
But daughters are not like that, uncle.

2046
02:25:04,809 --> 02:25:06,800
They leave all the little things
to parents' decision,

2047
02:25:06,978 --> 02:25:10,141
but they decide about important
things in life.

2048
02:25:10,482 --> 02:25:14,714
Because they're more interested in
80 future years than 20 years of past.

2049
02:25:16,421 --> 02:25:19,652
Parents consider sons as property
and daughters as respect.

2050
02:25:20,025 --> 02:25:21,083
Never think like that.

2051
02:25:21,259 --> 02:25:22,817
Think them as your children only.

2052
02:25:23,428 --> 02:25:24,895
Comedy of the situation is,

2053
02:25:25,096 --> 02:25:27,587
you're fighting as father of a girl,

2054
02:25:27,766 --> 02:25:30,792
for the same girl l'm fighting here
as her lover.

2055
02:25:30,935 --> 02:25:33,904
From time immemorial man has
been fighting for woman,

2056
02:25:34,105 --> 02:25:36,903
they're always happy,
only we are fighting!

2057
02:25:37,242 --> 02:25:38,903
We don't have any community feeling, uncle.

2058
02:25:42,914 --> 02:25:47,112
lf a girl loves a boy,
she'll find who he is, what he is,

2059
02:25:47,285 --> 02:25:49,014
when she likes everything about him,

2060
02:25:49,187 --> 02:25:51,678
and if you give daughter in marriage to him,

2061
02:25:51,856 --> 02:25:53,187
l don't know if you know this or not,

2062
02:25:53,358 --> 02:25:57,886
boys here give more respect
to father-in-law than father.

2063
02:25:58,096 --> 02:26:00,462
They always live at his feet.
But you don't do like that.

2064
02:26:00,632 --> 02:26:02,122
2You send hooligans to hit him.

2065
02:26:02,300 --> 02:26:03,699
Come get them bashed up, uncle.

2066
02:26:03,868 --> 02:26:07,201
Bash people who give up love
for little things.

2067
02:26:07,372 --> 02:26:12,639
But never hit a man who gave up
everything for love, uncle.

2068
02:26:13,778 --> 02:26:17,111
We find pure love in certain age and time,

2069
02:26:17,282 --> 02:26:22,379
if you kill that love also,
we'll never find love again in life.

2070
02:26:22,554 --> 02:26:26,718
Boys like you keep on loving a girl
even after she marries another man.

2071
02:26:27,058 --> 02:26:30,653
lf you get married to the same girl,
you don't love her for a year also.

2072
02:26:30,829 --> 02:26:33,059
When we love there will be only love.

2073
02:26:33,231 --> 02:26:35,165
But after marriage, there's a family.

2074
02:26:35,333 --> 02:26:37,631
lf we break a coconut in temple,
it'll become two halves.

2075
02:26:37,802 --> 02:26:39,827
lf we distribute it to devotees,
it'll be six pieces.

2076
02:26:39,971 --> 02:26:42,064
lf we make chutney, we can serve many.

2077
02:26:45,310 --> 02:26:48,074
Uncle, l can't build Taj Mahal
for your daughter.

2078
02:26:48,713 --> 02:26:50,738
But l can afford to buy her
meals in Taj hotel.

2079
02:26:54,486 --> 02:26:58,354
l know you raised your daughter
like your mother.

2080
02:27:00,558 --> 02:27:04,858
lf you send her to my home,
l'll look after her like my mother.

2081
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:13,835
l can't promise anything more, uncle.

2082
02:27:14,105 --> 02:27:15,037
l can't convince you.

2083
02:27:16,007 --> 02:27:19,443
Already my life is ruined unable
to convince your daughter.

2084
02:27:21,913 --> 02:27:23,107
The ball is now in your court, uncle.

2085
02:27:27,385 --> 02:27:28,215
You're right.

2086
02:27:30,288 --> 02:27:32,017
As a lover you're clear.

2087
02:27:34,292 --> 02:27:39,855
But l'm worried about her.

2088
02:27:43,201 --> 02:27:44,395
l raised her here.

2089
02:27:50,041 --> 02:27:51,065
What's this, dear?

2090
02:27:51,309 --> 02:27:54,301
There may be people who could lie
after swearing on Bhagavad Gita.

2091
02:27:54,979 --> 02:27:57,812
There may be people who lie
after swearing on God.

2092
02:27:57,982 --> 02:28:00,883
But l've always told truth
before you, father.

2093
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:03,887
l love him so much!

2094
02:28:08,793 --> 02:28:12,752
After killing love, l don't have the heart
to cry before lover's mausoleum.

2095
02:28:20,004 --> 02:28:23,235
l think lovers must sacrifice something.

2096
02:28:23,841 --> 02:28:26,241
You sacrificed love for your family.

2097
02:28:26,844 --> 02:28:30,075
l sacrificed my family for love.

2098
02:28:51,603 --> 02:28:54,697
Marriages aren't just laughter,
there are cries behind the marriage hall.

2099
02:28:55,106 --> 02:28:58,371
lt could be bride's lover!

2100
02:28:58,676 --> 02:29:01,474
lt could be the groom who missed out
marriage in the last minute.

2101
02:29:01,779 --> 02:29:06,375
lt could be father who conducts
daughter's marriage unwillingly.

2102
02:29:06,718 --> 02:29:10,484
lf no one cries, at least the onion peeler
in kitchen would shed tears.

2103
02:29:11,055 --> 02:29:12,147
Crying is common.

2104
02:29:15,727 --> 02:29:16,819
Give me quickly, bhai.

2105
02:29:17,462 --> 02:29:18,986
Mashed mutton for me.
- l'm on it.

2106
02:29:20,398 --> 02:29:21,296
Leg piece, bhai.

2107
02:29:21,566 --> 02:29:22,396
Give him leg piece.

2108
02:29:23,801 --> 02:29:24,825
He'll never change.

2109
02:29:25,570 --> 02:29:28,061
Come home, l'll take you to task.

2110
02:29:29,107 --> 02:29:31,234
Stop crying.
lt's embarrassing before others.

2111
02:29:31,409 --> 02:29:34,071
lnstead of sending me away,
why not allow me to stay here?

2112
02:29:34,245 --> 02:29:35,576
She's not feeling sad.

2113
02:29:35,747 --> 02:29:37,738
Will you work in mutton shop here?

2114
02:29:38,816 --> 02:29:39,510
Get going.

2115
02:29:40,618 --> 02:29:41,846
Bye, brother-in-law.

2116
02:29:42,587 --> 02:29:44,748
Are you going to foreign, brother-in-law?
What about that?

2117
02:29:45,089 --> 02:29:47,887
Mad boy, foreign means you thought America?

2118
02:29:48,593 --> 02:29:49,890
There everything is...
