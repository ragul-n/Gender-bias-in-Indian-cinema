00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:06,375
Someone is about to lose his life

00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:11,375
''ls going to fall in
love with someone''

00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,917
''The heart is fragile,
ensure it does not break''

5
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:17,792
''Make a promise that
this bond doesn't break''

6
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,917
''Ensure the
beloved doesn't get upset''

7
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:23,917
''May no one ever
plunder the world of beauty''

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,999
Doesn't his nose
look a little crooked?

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,209
''That's a manufacturing
defect, sweetheart.''

10
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,499
Go do your servicing job!

11
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,458
There comes the devil!

12
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,499
Where is Abby?

13
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,958
lt's 1 1 :30!
Where is Abby?

14
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:02,500
Hello. You have called
the residence of Abhinav Sinha.

15
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,500
''Pardon me,
l cannot talk to you right now.''

16
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:09,000
l have left for my office.

17
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:14,917
Please leave your name and telephone
number in a loud and clear voice ...

18
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:16,291
after the beep.

19
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:21,500
l will surely get in touch with you.

20
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,250
Abby must have
gone to meet some client.

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,249
Client? Which client?

22
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,541
He was saying something
last night....Donald!

23
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,042
He's gone to meet Donald.
- Donald?

24
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:36,250
Yes. Any problem?

25
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,042
Small one. Donald is with me.

26
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,042
Then he must have
gone to meet Donald Jr.

27
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,541
Rashmi! What about
the layouts in the studio?

28
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,084
''What happened, Ram?
You look upset.''

29
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,084
How are the beautiful
girls in my office doing?

30
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,583
Where are you headed?
- There is a problem.

31
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,708
Tell me.

32
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,583
l have designed this set
according to the location.

33
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,583
But there is some problem.
- Why? What happened?

34
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,624
l don't know what to do.

35
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:51,084
''Tell me something. Your Arts school
certificate is not fake, is it?''

36
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,084
''Abby, early morning ...
- Give me a pencil.''

37
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:02,583
Make this pillar a little thicker.

38
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,125
And fill up this empty space.

39
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,749
Abby is the creative
head of this agency.

40
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,625
And creative people have
their own style of working.

41
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,625
''They don't work with the clock,
they work with their heart.''

42
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:27,333
Why?
- The Devil was asking about you.

43
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,707
Nothing new about that.

44
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:34,667
Sometimes l feel that Ram Mohan must
have been my wife in my previous birth.

45
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,667
''To avoid him,
l told him you are with Donald.''

46
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,166
Because Donald is
with Ram in this office.

47
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,166
''Donald, it's five years since
Abby is handling your account.''

48
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,375
''Have you had any problem until today?
- That's okay, George.''

49
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,167
But that doesn't mean ...

50
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,667
''Abby, Ram was saying that
even until 1 1 ...''

51
00:06:02,084 --> 00:06:06,208
''Just a minute! Before you say
anything, l'd like to say something.''

52
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:11,749
l have a complaint ...

53
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,749
with Donald.

54
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,708
''Donald, don't you think
as creative head of Madness ...''

55
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,708
l should know everything
about my client ...

56
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:25,208
so that l can do my
best work for him?

57
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,208
l thought l have met the most
beautiful woman in the world.

58
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,708
But l realized today how wrong l was.

59
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,083
What do you mean?

60
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:42,708
l saw the most beautiful woman
in the world in your office today.

61
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,250
Who?
- Annie.

62
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,249
You saw Annie?

63
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,250
Annie?

64
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,208
Annie is my daughter.
- Exactly! And yet she is beautiful.

65
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:02,042
''George, have you seen her?''

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,250
''l have decided, that until Donald
doesn't give us permission ...''

67
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:12,250
to allow Annie to be the model
of our next campaign ...

68
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:18,250
l won't handle his account.

69
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,750
''The decision is in
your hands now, Donald.''

70
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,750
''lnfact, even Annie was saying
she is interested in modeling.''

71
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:36,250
Fantastic! That's good!

72
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,250
''What were you saying, George?
- No, it was nothing.''

73
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,792
''Actually, Ram Mohan was saying
the creative head doesn't work ...''

74
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,792
''No, l..l mean, you ...''

75
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,792
l think you were talking
about Donald's layout.

76
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,332
''Abby, l have complete faith in you.''

77
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:03,625
''George, l'll send your
contract and cheque by evening.''

78
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:11,791
''Ram, you were saying something ...''

79
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,792
You are too much!
When did you meet Annie?

80
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,917
Forget it!

81
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,792
You come late everyday.
You'll put me in a soup some day.

82
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,874
l just cannot get up early.

83
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,666
But you will have
to get up tomorrow morning.

84
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,834
Why?
- Have you heard of Atlantis?

85
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,834
''Yes that US based agency, right?''

86
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,916
Atlantis wants
to establish in lndia.

87
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,333
lt has even given a proposal
to Madness for a merger.

88
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,541
But why?
- The owner is Mr.Daruwala.

89
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:44,333
''Alright listen, the meeting
is tomorrow at Oberoi at 9 am.''

90
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,375
What are you
doing here early morning?

91
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:08,875
Don't ask me! l have to
attend a boring board meeting.

92
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,957
Let's set your mood right.
- How?

93
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,875
l've made your cola jingle.

94
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,208
What!!

95
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:22,582
''Come, hear it.''

96
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:27,708
l have 10 minutes.
Will that be enough?

97
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:54,375
''Sir, he must be on his way, sir.''

98
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,957
l had told him yesterday;
he should be here.

99
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:02,416
We'll wait for a few minutes.

100
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,250
''After thinking over every aspect,
l have reached the decision ....''

101
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,916
that we accept the proposal
of merger with Atlantis.

102
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,958
l'd like to introduce you
to our new vice president ...

103
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:49,958
''and the lndian operations head,
Ms.Meenakshi Malhotra, alias Maxi!''

104
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,958
''Before we proceed, l'd like to brief
you about Atlantis' work culture.''

105
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,500
This company has a major
problem with discipline.

106
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,500
''lt's such an important meeting,
and your creative head ...''

107
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:20,500
He's gone for a
meeting with a client.

108
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,500
''ln the first year, our turnover was
Rs.200,000; today, it's 500 million.''

109
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,709
And l am sure even Atlantis
must have kept this in mind ...

110
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,124
before you gave us
the merger proposal.

111
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:41,041
''And there is mainly only one person
responsible for this, Abhinav Sinha.''

112
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:57,041
l know Mr.Abhinav Sinha is
hugely responsible ...

113
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,874
for the success of this company.

114
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:04,375
But he will now have to
work how Atlantis wants.

115
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:13,042
You can try.

116
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,542
Change this logo. Why don't
you people not work seriously?

117
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,375
You cannot do this.
- What's going on here?

118
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:27,583
Do you want to do some work or not?

119
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:33,084
''We can do work only
if you bring work, sir.''

120
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,332
So what was l saying?

121
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,041
A girl does not get
impressed by colouring your hair.

122
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,083
''lt's my style, you won't understand,
so forget it.''

123
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,584
ls it? Bet Rs.500?
- l'm game.

124
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,083
Try fixing a date with Julie.

125
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:54,124
''Alright, keep the cash ready.''

126
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,124
Watch him get beaten.
Get the money out.

127
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,124
Let him get beaten first.

128
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:02,124
''Julie babes, l was thinking,
tonight ...''

129
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:06,583
Why did you slap me?

130
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:12,583
Where does Mr.Abhinav Sinha sit?

131
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,083
Who?

132
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:26,166
But who are you?

133
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,459
''l'm sorry,
l didn't recognise you, ma'am.''

134
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:31,875
''That's okay. Where is Abby?
- Actually, he ...''

135
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:37,125
''Has gone to meet some client, right?''

136
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,875
lsn't it good?
Abby has made it.

137
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,500
''Despite that,
there is scope for improvement.''

138
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,625
''Ma'am, without his permission...''

139
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,166
Ask Abby to come and meet me
as soon as he comes in.

140
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,666
Why thank God for such a small thing?
What's the problem?

141
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:19,249
But you are wearing pants.

142
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,666
Maxi is Madness' new boss.
- New boss of Madness?

143
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,249
Has George changed his name?

144
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,291
''Stop joking, Abby.''

145
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:31,208
What's this?
- Maxi. She made those changes.

146
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,832
''Didn't you tell her,
without my permission ...''

147
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,000
''l did, but ...
- But what?''

148
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,208
She didn't listen;
and she has called you to her cabin.

149
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,708
''No, the matter is very urgent.
Come to my office immediately.''

150
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,208
''Do one thing, come over.
No, come tomorrow.''

151
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,208
Who is Maxi? How dare she
enter my cabin ...

152
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:56,000
and make changes in my
designs without my permission?

153
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,625
You are worried about the designs?
A lot is going to change out here.

154
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,874
What do you mean?

155
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,249
Why didn't you come for
the meeting yesterday?

156
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,542
''l was coming for the meeting,
and met Ronnie on the way.''

157
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,915
''He cracked the cola jingle,
so l went to hear it.''

158
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,208
''You went to hear it,
and l had to hear so much from her.''

159
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:14,250
''ln the meeting,in everyone's presence,
she said Abby is irresponsible.''

160
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:17,750
Who is she to say that?
- She's our new vice president.

161
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,750
Why?
- Because the merger is through.

162
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,708
Why do we need the merger?
We are already a 500 million company.

163
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:31,250
We want to become
a 5000 million company.

164
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,750
''lf you have seen me enough,
shall we get down to business?''

165
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:03,750
You have changed
my designs today morning.

166
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,416
l am the creative head of Madness.

167
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,791
No one here even touches my designs
without my permission.

168
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:14,292
''And if changes are to be made,
you got to talk to me.''

169
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,791
''Which means, l'll have to
ask even if l want to smoke?''

170
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,749
You were talking about 5000 million?

171
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,334
''Yes, but it will take you
some time to understand that.''

172
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,541
''For now, l only want to say that
Madness is no more a small company.''

173
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,833
''But to understand that,the people here
will have to change their attitude.''

174
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,750
l wanted to discuss something
with you about our new client.

175
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,334
''But l was told, as usual, you have
gone to meet some important client.''

176
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:09,833
l will wait for you at 9:30 am
tomorrow in this office.

177
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,416
''You?
- Yes, me.''

178
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,916
What are you doing here?
- Waiting.

179
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:50,375
Someone told me yesterday there is
a very important meeting at 9:30 today

180
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,417
This...this is my chair.

181
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:02,417
lt's very stiff.

182
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:18,457
l am asking you not to.

183
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:22,416
''A new company of France, Serpent.
Makes perfumes.''

184
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,416
They want us to launch
their product in lndia.

185
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,083
''And for your information,
let me tell you ...''

186
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:35,416
lndia's top three company's
market share is 3000 million.

187
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,917
3860 million.
- l'm glad you know your figures.

188
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,917
l always pay attention to figures.

189
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,416
l have planned a new type
of deal with Serpent.

190
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,458
Which is perhaps happening
for the first time in this company.

191
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,832
''Apart from the expenses
of film production, ...''

192
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,499
they will also give us
a share in profits.

193
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,958
''ln business language,
it is called revenue sharing.''

194
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,999
Can't you sit without fidgeting?

195
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,958
Can't help it; l'm used to working.

196
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,958
We have to give them a
presentation after four days.

197
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:13,499
l am going to Chennai today.

198
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,958
l want you to show me all the layouts
of this campaign when l am back.

199
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,958
l want you to make sure
we don't lose this account.

200
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,500
''Don't forget,
Madness is now a part of Atlantis.''

201
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,332
''And just for the records, ...''

202
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,000
''whenever Atlantis has taken an
interest in any deal, it has bagged it''

203
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,000
l'd heard women speak a lot.

204
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:46,000
l am sure today.

205
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:49,500
''Durga, a flower vase
will break inside now.''

206
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:51,000
Sorry?

207
00:19:55,084 --> 00:20:00,000
Go and clean up.

208
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:49,042
''They are good, but l don't
think our clients will like them.''

209
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,999
They like them very much.

210
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,666
What??
- Yes.

211
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,959
''l just showed it to them.
lnfact, they like our entire campaign.''

212
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:04,333
We have organized
a big party to celebrate.

213
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,749
How could you dare to show this
presentation to the clients ...

214
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,041
in my absence?

215
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,625
''l don't understand you, Maxi.
What do you want after all?''

216
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,375
''You wanted the account, you got it.
- Abby, you ...''

217
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,458
And...l didn't go to the clients.
They called today morning.

218
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,000
They wanted to meet us.
You were not back from Chennai yet.

219
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:27,707
''l and George went and spoke to them,
that's it.''

220
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:30,166
lf even after that
you feel l am wrong ...

221
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,166
''This is very expensive,
and belongs to the company.''

222
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:40,250
lt's difficult

223
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:59,250
See the moon with the sun

224
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:05,750
''Both will fall in love,
try stopping it''

225
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,750
lt's difficult

226
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:23,333
''There is dusk in the eyes
and dawn on the lips''

227
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:26,834
Love has engulfed everyone

228
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:43,875
See the sky with the earth

229
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,875
See the bells with the anklets

230
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,875
See the moon with the sun ...

231
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,916
''The heart is frigid,
but full of fire''

232
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:45,916
What an unseen sight it is!

233
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:02,916
See the lady with her lover

234
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,958
See the composition with the poet

235
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,958
See the moon with the sun ...

236
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,040
How can we do the Serpent campaign?

237
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,040
You are asking us to
shoot between 21st and 26th.

238
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:54,500
lt is already the 7th today.
There is no time for pre-production.

239
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,709
''We have to choose the models,
fix the location.''

240
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,040
And Abby is missing.

241
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:04,500
''Magic! l have come,
but late as usual.''

242
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,082
''So, what's going on?''

243
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,500
We are talking about
the location for Serpent.

244
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,000
''Actually, l have a suggestion.''

245
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,542
''New Zealand. Where there are
mountains, lakes, valleys.''

246
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,583
We cannot get a
better place than this.

247
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:39,000
''What do you think, Maxi?
- Actually, even l have a suggestion.''

248
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:48,500
''We want valleys, lakes,
and mountains in the backdrop.''

249
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:54,042
We have all these here too.

250
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:59,791
This is Nepal. A much more cheaper
location than New Zealand ...

251
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,082
and beautiful too.

252
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,584
''We'll choose the models from here,
even the crew will be local.''

253
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,041
Everything at a 30 % cheaper cost.

254
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:29,209
Want something?

255
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:33,332
You are sitting here?
ls the seat vacant?

256
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,584
''Sorry, someone else is occupying it.''

257
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:39,584
l was asking for Ram Mohan.
You two think alike.

258
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,124
You'll be good company
for each other.

259
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,083
Why will l sit here?
My seat is over there.

260
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,124
This is my seat.

261
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:52,084
Yours?
- Yes.

262
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,125
You are going to Nepal?
- The flight is going there.

263
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:12,625
''Will you leave my hand, please?''

264
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,459
Which is your seat?
- l'm sitting there.

265
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:19,125
With him?...No.

266
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:24,625
''Ram Mohan,
can you vacate the seat for me?''

267
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,625
''Why?
This is my seat, l will sit here.''

268
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,167
Why do you trouble ...
- Are you interested in her?

269
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:34,125
What nonsense! No.
- l am.

270
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,167
Then go.

271
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:51,666
You are quite...bold.

272
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:57,249
And you are quite beautiful.

273
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,291
''But frankly, l'm quite nervous today.''

274
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:03,416
l've taken a
flight for the first time.

275
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,708
Come on! You must be joking.

276
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:15,208
''They are saying something
about the seat belt, right?''

277
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,708
Does this have to be fixed?

278
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,208
Like this?

279
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,208
Please help me.

280
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,750
Doesn't this man feel ashamed?

281
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:07,250
You do it very well.

282
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:12,250
The journey will be good now.

283
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:19,250
What else do you do?

284
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:04,292
Strange!
No one has come to receive us.

285
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:10,292
''Sandy, look around and see is someone
is carrying an 'Atlantis' placard.''

286
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,375
No.

287
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:15,042
lt's not possible.
lt's such a big corporate company.

288
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,833
''Don't bother me.
As it is, l'm angry.''

289
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:25,291
What's new about that?

290
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:36,583
''Alright, l'll take one alone.''

291
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,833
Where were you?...Now where is Abby?
- Over here.

292
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:51,833
l could not bear to see you dejected.
So ...

293
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,916
''Look, l have found out everything.''

294
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:02,833
''This is our bus, and l have the
hotel reservation details.''

295
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,875
That's better.

296
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,416
Welcome ma'am.

297
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:25,375
''l've been waiting for you.
- Sorry, l was busy inside.''

298
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,082
How was the journey?
- Good.

299
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:35,416
How's Mumbai?
- Good.

300
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:38,417
''Take, l've brought what
you wanted from lndia.''

301
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,375
You remembered?
- How can l forget what you say?

302
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,875
''Thank you. Come, your car is waiting.''

303
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,917
Couldn't you think
of something new to say?

304
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,375
Helpless! the situation is very old.

305
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:03,375
''Ma'am, get in.
Take ma'am comfortably.''

306
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:05,833
''You aren't coming?
- No, l'll follow you.''

307
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:08,665
A group is coming from Mumbai.
l have to receive them.

308
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,540
O God!
- What happened?

309
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,957
They were on your flight!

310
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,249
''You go, l'll follow.''

311
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,416
''You were on this flight?
There was a group on it, sir?''

312
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:24,167
Beautiful models?
They were a shooting cast.

313
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:29,417
Are there more passengers inside?

314
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,917
''What nonsense is he talking?
- Sorry, l got stuck in a jam.''

315
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:41,458
The traffic was bumper to bumper.
Even Pokhra has become like Mumbai.

316
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,999
What are you doing!
Who is he?

317
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,582
Hey! Talk to me.

318
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,458
lt must be containing jewelry.
lsn't your jewelry my jewelry?

319
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:52,958
How do you know it contains jewelry?
- You thief!

320
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:56,540
How do you know
there's jewelry in this?

321
00:35:56,541 --> 00:36:00,458
''Leave him! l am your guide, Bahadur.
He is Bunty guide.''

322
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,000
We work together in tourist business.
Let him go.

323
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:08,041
Make that mistake again
and l'll kill you.

324
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:11,500
''Enjoy your stay in Nepal.
Good day. Take care of them, Bahadur.''

325
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,749
Don't do it next time.
- l'm sorry.

326
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:20,000
''lf this is not that group,
where is that group?''

327
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:50,000
''lt's 6 am, sir.''

328
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:11,042
Madam asked us to wake you up at 6 am.
You have to go for a shoot.

329
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:18,542
Then wake madam up.

330
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:27,042
''Did you wake up Mr.Abby?
- Madam,l tried, but he didn't get up.''

331
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:44,624
''Abby, are you getting up or not?''

332
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,792
She screams even in dreams.
What a woman!

333
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:52,084
''Abby, are you coming out or not?''

334
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:59,084
''Abby, if you don't come out
in five minutes, l'll come in.''

335
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:06,084
''You cannot come in,
because l sleep in the nude.''

336
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:09,832
Does one sleep like that?

337
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:13,084
Now will l have to even learn
how to sleep from you?

338
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,666
l warned you.

339
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:20,375
Now will you stand just like that
or wear something?

340
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:25,083
ln your presence?

341
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:31,125
l am going down.

342
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:36,125
l have lots of time!

343
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:13,166
l know! l am 15 minutes late.

344
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:18,667
''But one has to do a lot in the
morning. Bathe, brush, potty ...''

345
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,167
What's this?

346
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,667
But you won't understand that now.
Shall we go?

347
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,166
How can you look so
beautiful early in the morning?

348
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,042
Do you know who you look like?
- Who?

349
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:57,208
Rekha Koirala.
- Who is she?

350
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,708
A distant cousin of
Rekha and Manisha Koirala.

351
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:17,208
A mole can be black.
But the heart should not be black.

352
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,708
The heart should always be pure.
To be a good model ...

353
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,708
''a good heart, a giving heart,
is very necessary.''

354
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:32,290
You have all the
ingredients of a good ...

355
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:35,250
You have all the
ingredients of a good ...

356
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:39,250
l am your guide sir; Bunty guide.

357
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:45,750
''So you are the guide without a guide.
- No sir, l have a license.''

358
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:49,750
''Look, you came to take us yesterday,
but didn't.''

359
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:55,250
''Sir, yesterday l got stuck
is such a bad traffic jam ...''

360
00:40:56,834 --> 00:41:01,750
Why are you jamming my traffic?

361
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:07,250
So l was saying ...

362
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,291
''Can l sit here, sir?
- Yes.''

363
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:17,792
Thank you. l am your guide
- ls it?

364
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:20,916
''What do you do, sir?''

365
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:22,916
l'm the marketing manager
of this company.

366
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:26,792
Market...bazaar...
You are a bazaar officer.

367
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:32,541
Yes.
- Pleased to meet you.

368
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:35,291
''Sir, shall l ask you something?''

369
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:39,291
Are you Nepalese?
- Nepalese? No.

370
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:56,833
''Come on guys, we are here.''

371
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:02,833
lt's so cold here.

372
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,916
Do l have to tell you all that?

373
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:27,499
l've been telling you since a week
l need all clothes ...

374
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,375
''Sandy, what's happening?
When will the shooting begin?''

375
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:34,208
Why ask me? Ask Abby.

376
00:42:34,292 --> 00:42:39,334
Does one have to ask
everything from Abby?

377
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,916
What's going on here?

378
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:47,875
''Maxi, we have a problem.
We cannot shoot.''

379
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,916
Why?
- There is no light.

380
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:52,917
lt's very foggy.
lt will take 2-3 hours to clear up.

381
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,916
2-3 hours?
- Yes.

382
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,916
''What are you saying, Pradhan!''

383
00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:00,875
Tell the location
that Atlantis team is here.

384
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:05,875
To make the weather right
and let us shoot.

385
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,875
What will we do now?
l have promised our client.

386
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:14,915
We have to deliver
the campaign in 10 days.

387
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:16,957
We'll do the delivery on time.

388
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:19,250
''Abby, l'm giving Poornima this dress.
ls it okay?''

389
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,875
''lt's perfect. Fix a light on it,
and we'll manage.''

390
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:23,625
What?

391
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:27,333
Sandy relax! Tell the crew the
shooting has been postponed.

392
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:29,165
They can relax.

393
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,916
3-4 hours delay in work
will make no difference.

394
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,916
The atmosphere here
is like a beautiful woman.

395
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:41,916
''lt's sometimes sunny,
and sometimes foggy here.''

396
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:43,957
But it's always green.

397
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:46,417
What do l tell you?
You seem to be Nepalese yourself.

398
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,791
ls there any place worth
seeing close by?

399
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:55,458
''Madam, there is a temple close by.''

400
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,958
l'd like to go there.

401
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,958
''Maxi, and temple;
isn't it a strange combination?''

402
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,458
Let's go.

403
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:22,958
''This is that temple. There is the
basil plant, the Nandi bull.''

404
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,709
lt's a spot where
you'll see all Gods.

405
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:29,000
People come here for peace.

406
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,500
''Look, the sun came out
the moment you came to the temple.''

407
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,500
May God fulfill everyone's wishes.

408
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,000
Oblation.

409
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:11,541
You perhaps
don't believe in all this.

410
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:35,542
How is your bazaar doing?
- What is it?

411
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,584
ls the hotel good?
- Yes.

412
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:42,083
The food?
- Yes. Why do you ask?

413
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:46,459
''lt's my job, l'm your guide.
lt's my duty to ask you.''

414
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:48,749
Are you sleeping well?

415
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,041
''Whether l sleep or not,
why do you care?''

416
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:54,041
''Why are you getting angry?
Until you are here, it is my duty.''

417
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:59,042
Are you Nepalese?

418
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:19,500
Now watch the next shot.
The camera...over here..okay.

419
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,833
''This is the frame,
and the model is over there.''

420
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,584
Hey! What's going on?
- Even l want to see the frame.

421
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:29,124
Want to see the frame?
- Yes.

422
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:32,124
''Alright, come.
But the flow of water is strong.''

423
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,584
So the shot is ...

424
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:40,249
Stupid! What have you done!
- What did l do?

425
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:43,166
Then did l do it?

426
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:47,832
What do we do now?
- We'll party!

427
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:50,125
Why did l meet you!

428
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:54,125
Even l want to see the frame!
We'll have to hang in the frame now.

429
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,625
''lt's not my fault.
- No, it's all my fault.''

430
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:03,625
l don't even know to swim.
- You don't!

431
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:10,125
Save me!
- Save you? You put us in trouble.

432
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:17,666
Just watch what l do if anything
happens to me! Stop this boat!

433
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:21,666
l'll stop it.
Hey stop!...lt's not listening.

434
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:26,874
Give me your hand.
- l won't.

435
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:31,333
''Alright, don't.''

436
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:18,042
Please get up.

437
00:48:42,459 --> 00:48:47,208
You just kissed me.
- l did it to save your life.

438
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:50,750
What are you saying! You kissed me
like that even after l recovered?

439
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:57,750
You don't have to feel so guilty.

440
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:03,499
One does want to kiss sometimes.

441
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,750
''And anyway, l didn't quite mind.''

442
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:12,250
''Look, there is no need to
make such a big issue of it.''

443
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:15,291
''l have kissed before, okay!''

444
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:18,250
That doesn't make a difference to me.
l am large hearted.

445
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:20,791
''And anyway,
even l have kissed before.''

446
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:24,750
''And l think, when someone
kisses somebody, he likes her.''

447
00:49:25,334 --> 00:49:28,791
And Maxi...l think you like me.

448
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:39,291
You like me.

449
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:41,791
Maybe....a little.

450
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:47,333
But that doesn't mean ...

451
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:52,791
''l've said this before, and am saying
it again. Women speak too much.''

452
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:24,374
''Abby, you don't have
to tell anyone anything.''

453
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:27,708
Are you two alright?
- Relax! We are fine.

454
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:30,416
We'd got scared.

455
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:33,083
There is no need to
tell anyone anything.

456
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:36,083
''What?
- Not me, Maxi said that.''

457
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:40,833
''What happened, Maxi?
- Nothing. Abby saved my life.''

458
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:47,375
And Maxi returned my breaths.

459
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,167
No.

460
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:07,375
You?

461
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:25,875
''Sandy, it's so cold here.
Call for a coffee.''

462
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,875
Will you pass on the brush? l haven't
brushed my hair since a week.

463
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:36,875
l think you love Abby.

464
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,375
Love?

465
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:51,416
''Madam, l think you love Abby.''

466
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:55,917
''That is why you are always praising
him, always standing by him.''

467
00:51:57,958 --> 00:52:00,708
You are right.
l love Abby.

468
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:05,917
But not like you think.

469
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,833
''Do you know, whenever
anyone has a problem, ...''

470
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,499
he helps like it's his own problem.

471
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,958
He doesn't even expect a thank you.

472
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:32,458
''After two months of marriage, l came
to know my husband is having an affair.''

473
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,540
l had decided to leave him.

474
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:43,458
''At that time,
there was only one person ...''

475
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:49,458
who stood by me.

476
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:53,000
''Abby and me are
very good friends, Maxi.''

477
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:57,500
People never believe a man and
woman can be good friends too.

478
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:06,833
''Anyway, l think you
two love each other.''

479
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:15,000
Who told you Abby loves me?

480
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:18,000
He did?
- No.

481
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:22,000
Even he does not reveal
his feelings like you.

482
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,582
But shall l tell you something?

483
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:31,582
Love is a beautiful feeling.

484
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:36,625
And you have to be
very fortunate to get it.

485
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:33,084
Meeting an unknown girl ...

486
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:36,084
made my life ...

487
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:41,583
even more beautiful

488
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:05,583
''My heart's desires
have been fulfilled''

489
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:20,625
''l fell in love
with her at first sight''

490
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:25,625
Meeting an unknown girl ...

491
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:12,667
''How lonely l was,
how lonesome!''

492
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:21,667
''Her arrival has brought
along spring in my life''

493
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:27,667
My eyes began to dream

494
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:37,708
My heartbeats went into a new trance

495
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:43,208
She is my first love

496
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:52,708
''She is my peace, my need''

497
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,708
Meeting an unknown girl ...

498
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:42,750
''l am lost in her
thoughts all day and night''

499
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:51,792
''When she smiles,
my hearts skips a beat''

500
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:58,291
When her tresses fly ...

501
00:58:03,834 --> 00:58:08,291
the atmosphere fills with love

502
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:13,792
That beauty ...

503
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:22,792
''became my wish, my desire''

504
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:32,333
Meeting an unknown girl ...

505
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:06,875
You! What is it?
Let me work.

506
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:11,875
''Why are you getting angry?The weather,
the greenery here, is so beautiful.''

507
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:17,208
And even the snow. Are you Nepalese?
- No! Do l look like a Nepalese?

508
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:20,375
''Who are you? What do you want?
lf you come here again, l'll kill you!''

509
00:59:25,583 --> 00:59:28,583
''We want the driver here on time
tomorrow, or our shooting ...''

510
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:22,084
''We canned good
shots today, didn't we?''

511
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:27,417
What's the matter?
You've been avoiding me since morning.

512
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,332
Any problem?

513
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,458
lt's not mentioned in any contract
that l must talk to you everyday.

514
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,999
''Maxi, what's the problem?''

515
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,958
What happened?
- Nothing...nothing at all.

516
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:52,999
''And anyway,
what difference does it make to you?''

517
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,458
''lt does, that's why l am asking.
You've been avoiding me since morning.''

518
01:00:57,041 --> 01:01:00,166
Why aren't you talking to me?
- You have Tanya to talk to.

519
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:06,958
''l didn't call Tanya to the
camp fire, she came herself.''

520
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:11,000
''And if she comes and asks me
to dance with her, l cannot refuse.''

521
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:15,000
Exactly!
How can you ever refuse a girl.

522
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:22,040
You think l'm like that?

523
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:24,500
You are like that.

524
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:29,040
''You misunderstand me, Maxi.''

525
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:31,500
''No, l think l understand you
very well now.''

526
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:37,040
Please don't make an
issue of such a small thing.

527
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:39,249
Until yesterday l felt there
was something between us.

528
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,542
You are right.
There is a lot between us.

529
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:46,000
''There is Tanya, Sonia, Poornima...''

530
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,542
You think there is no difference
between those girls and you?

531
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,041
''l don't just think, l am sure.''

532
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,542
''Alright, then there is
no point in talking to you.''

533
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,041
''That's what l am saying,
no point talking to you.''

534
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,041
Woman!

535
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:57,083
Hello sir.
- Hello. One large Bacardi

536
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:20,583
''Here you are, sir.''

537
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:37,125
You are very lucky.
- Why sir?

538
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:41,625
Very few girls your size.
- Yes.

539
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:45,625
''And where there are few girls,
there are fewer problems.''

540
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:50,207
Understand?

541
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,125
One more.

542
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:08,167
Looks like some girl
broke your heart.

543
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:12,207
''No, not at all.''

544
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:14,666
''According to her,
l don't have a heart.''

545
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:18,167
''And one who doesn't have a heart,
how can it break?''

546
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:29,542
One for no heart.

547
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:41,708
l'll sit there.

548
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:20,208
The camp fire yesterday was fun.
You dance very well.

549
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,208
That's the problem.
- Where is your friend?

550
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:29,208
She was with you until yesterday.
- Everything changed after yesterday.

551
01:05:31,292 --> 01:05:36,708
''Anyway, forget it.''

552
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:43,459
What do you do to look
more beautiful everyday?

553
01:05:51,292 --> 01:05:54,250
Don't you think there
are too many people here?

554
01:05:55,292 --> 01:05:59,250
Let's go to my room.
We can sit comfortably and talk.

555
01:06:13,334 --> 01:06:14,292
Good idea.

556
01:06:35,334 --> 01:06:40,208
''You make the drinks,
l'll just be back.''

557
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:23,334
My body is melting ...

558
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:29,375
little by little

559
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:52,375
''At this age, every moment ...''

560
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:06,375
there is danger

561
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:12,375
My body is melting ...

562
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:38,917
''l feel a piercing,
the wind is biting cold''

563
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:45,917
What do l say where l hurt

564
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,917
''Don't air the sparks,
don't make me crave like that''

565
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,458
My body is burning ...

566
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,458
little by little

567
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,958
My body is melting ...

568
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:37,500
Even you enjoy this beautiful night

569
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:45,000
''Why are you standing away,
come close to me''

570
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:50,000
My fair arms are inviting you

571
01:09:52,541 --> 01:09:58,500
l'm getting frantic ...

572
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:04,000
little by little

573
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:12,500
''At this age, every moment ...''

574
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:18,541
there is danger

575
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:38,249
Who must've killed the poor girl?

576
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,749
What wrong had she done?

577
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:44,374
But whoever killed her...

578
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:47,457
has surely seen me

579
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:49,374
Which means...

580
01:11:49,375 --> 01:11:54,459
l'm in trouble

581
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:56,832
''Sorry, Tanya...''

582
01:11:56,833 --> 01:12:02,125
but l must go

583
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:40,917
''Hello, sir.
- Hello''

584
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:43,750
Any news?
- Nothing much

585
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,959
This lady was the first person
to see the corpse

586
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,958
lt's so strange

587
01:13:23,959 --> 01:13:26,708
Tanya was dancing with us
before the campfire

588
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,707
Who could've killed her?

589
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:34,749
How'd l know?

590
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,708
l've been noticing you since
last night... you look upset

591
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:41,666
Quarrelled with Abby?

592
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,958
Now why'd l quarrel with Abby?

593
01:13:43,959 --> 01:13:45,749
Even if l do...

594
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,207
l wouldn't be upset

595
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:50,834
''l'm going out,
call Abby for company''

596
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:52,791
''Maxi, breakfast''

597
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:53,708
Hang on

598
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:00,750
Gajji

599
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:04,791
''Yes?
- Not yes, Gajji''

600
01:14:04,792 --> 01:14:05,750
So?

601
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,833
l'll put it straight

602
01:14:08,834 --> 01:14:11,624
''You killed the girl, didn't you?''

603
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:12,791
What...?
Killed the girl?

604
01:14:12,792 --> 01:14:14,541
''What are you saying, sir?''

605
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:17,666
lt hardly matters to me

606
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:20,624
''Okay, where's my packet of stuff?''

607
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:23,124
''Stuff?
- Yes, stuff''

608
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,833
''That's nonsense, sir''

609
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:27,375
l know nothing about any stuff.
l was only...

610
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:29,541
Don't play games with me

611
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:31,833
lt's stuff worth 100 million

612
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,124
For a 100 million...

613
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:35,458
''l can hack you to
hundred pieces, you dig?''

614
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,749
Mr Gajji...

615
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,083
you can't cut me up
into hundred pieces anyway

616
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:43,708
''Try to understand me,
don't get excited...''

617
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:45,958
You'd better get this!

618
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:48,916
You have 24 hours. Only 24 hours

619
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:51,291
lf l don't get my stuff back...

620
01:14:51,834 --> 01:14:53,041
you die

621
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:55,124
''Listen to me, sir...''

622
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,041
Ass!

623
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:02,207
What stuff?

624
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:04,375
Where have you been? lt's been
three hours since l sent for you

625
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,874
''What do l say, sir?''

626
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:10,500
lt's hell out there... people and cars

627
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:13,958
Pokhra has become Mumbai...
- Shut up

628
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:17,125
''You think l'm a tourist?
- Tourist, you, sir?''

629
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:19,874
You are our master

630
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:22,040
l've known you since years

631
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:24,458
''Forgive me, it's my mistake, sir''

632
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:27,917
''l'll be careful henceforth.
How can l help you, sir?''

633
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:32,040
Did you know Tanya?

634
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,874
''Yes, sir''

635
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:37,208
''How well?
- How well, sir?''

636
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,500
''She was an angel
of a travel agent, sir''

637
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,874
''She was my provider, sir''

638
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:45,458
She got me so many clients

639
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:47,874
l have but one complaint

640
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,916
God takes away good people so soon

641
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:52,500
What did l ask you?
Don't give me your damn story

642
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:57,583
''Sir, you asked me how well l knew her.
l'm telling you only that much''

643
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:03,833
Where were you last night?

644
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:06,500
Who told you?
- Told me what?

645
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:10,208
About where l was last night.
- That's just my question

646
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:13,374
''Forget it, sir,
it's all over''

647
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:16,875
''What do you mean?
- l mean, l had time to spare''

648
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:20,250
''By God, l was going home,
and l found Rajeshwar on the way''

649
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:22,875
''Rajeshwar?
- My friend, sir. He's a driver''

650
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,583
He asked me for a drink
and we went to the bar

651
01:16:25,584 --> 01:16:27,915
No knowing when we gulped
a whole bottled down...

652
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,208
Ass! Just answer to the point

653
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:34,500
''Sir, l don't understand.
Why are you asking me all this?''

654
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:37,250
Tanya was murdered last night

655
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:38,875
Yes

656
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,709
''The assassin could be anyone.
- True, sir''

657
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:47,584
''You, too.
- Oh no, sir. Not me''

658
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:50,040
You are my master

659
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:52,709
''Tanya helped me make a living.
Who'd kill the one who provides, sir?''

660
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,041
Shut up

661
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:55,957
''Clue, sir''

662
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:59,333
The bartender had seen a chap
with Tanya late in the night

663
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:03,125
''Take this case very seriously, Ashok.
- Right, sir''

664
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,957
lt's an lndian girl who was murdered

665
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,999
How long has this bartender
been working here?

666
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,708
''Five years, sir''

667
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:15,667
''Call the bartender here,
and interrogate all the waiters''

668
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,750
''Bartender, come here.
- Coming, sir''

669
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
The inspector wants you

670
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:33,708
''Greetings, sir''

671
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:36,041
''What's your name?
- Ramchandra, sir''

672
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:37,542
Sit

673
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:42,208
''He was in the bar last night, sir''

674
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,292
He was dead drunk

675
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,457
Looked quite tensed

676
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:51,333
''His looks?
- He was fair, sir''

677
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:56,708
Taller than me

678
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:59,167
''Describe his nose, hair, lips...''

679
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:03,709
''The bar was dimly lit, sir...''

680
01:18:05,916 --> 01:18:10,000
Can you recognise him
if you see him again?

681
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:12,000
Yes

682
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:24,375
He's the one

683
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:27,207
''Ma'am is calling you.
- Go on, l'll be there''

684
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:32,541
''lt's getting late, sir.
- Go on!''

685
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,207
Saheb wants you.
- Saheb? Who?

686
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:39,584
Come on.
- Where are you taking me? Let me go

687
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:42,625
Sit down.
- Why have you called me here?

688
01:18:43,041 --> 01:18:45,124
Where were you last night?
- Why?

689
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,999
''Would you tell me, or...?''

690
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,708
l was in my room.
- Sir...

691
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:53,082
Mr Ram Mohan is lying

692
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:58,041
He got his keys from the reception
at 4 am in the morning

693
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:00,709
l had forgotten that.
l had gone out for a while...

694
01:19:01,083 --> 01:19:03,583
Out? Where?

695
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:05,459
l was...

696
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:10,375
You'd better give me the truth

697
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,207
''Jaggi, have you seen Ravana?''

698
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:19,875
Yes. The police have taken him away.
- Why did they take him away?

699
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:23,124
His looks give him away.
- Sandy!

700
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,915
Police station? Why?

701
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:27,375
l've committed no crime. l only went...
- Only?

702
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:31,500
''Only what, Mr Ram?
- l'll tell you the truth, inspector''

703
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,207
lt's private...
- Shoot

704
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:38,083
l was zapped last night.
A shoot is quite stressing

705
01:19:38,542 --> 01:19:41,250
So l thought l'd...
just to relax...

706
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:45,875
You did what?
- l had gone for a massage

707
01:19:47,292 --> 01:19:50,208
So you had gone for a massage?
- Yes. Nothing more

708
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:53,416
''What's going on, Ram?''

709
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:55,832
''Ma'am, l...
- Last night Mr Ram...''

710
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:58,166
How strange!
Why are you telling her?

711
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,667
l told you l was tired.
- l don't understand

712
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:03,207
You were tired last night?
What's happening?

713
01:20:03,208 --> 01:20:05,500
''Sir, l just remembered''

714
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:08,166
He isn't the one

715
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:12,625
''What kind of a joke is this? You want
to take me for a ride, do you?''

716
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:19,417
There was a little misunderstanding.
You may go

717
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:29,125
Can l take a look?

718
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,125
Not at all

719
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:36,875
You are good at it

720
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,708
''Where are you going, sir?
This leads to the kitchen''

721
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:07,750
That's where l want to go.
- Oh no. Only waiters can go this way

722
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,874
''l'm also a waiter, in lndia.
Old habits die hard''

723
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:14,625
''No wonder you look like an lndian.
They pay you well there, isn't it?''

724
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:18,041
Which hotel do you work for?

725
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:19,624
Hotel Atlantis

726
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,707
What hotel is that?

727
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:27,499
l'll tell you later

728
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,708
And from the front?
- From the front...

729
01:21:31,292 --> 01:21:33,459
''it was small, yes''

730
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:37,666
Can you describe anything else?
How was his nose?

731
01:21:40,459 --> 01:21:43,333
His nose...

732
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:46,292
''like mine... no, not like mine''

733
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:50,625
''lnspector, l can tell you
about that boy''

734
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:54,208
''You? Have you seen him?
- Yes, inspector''

735
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:10,875
His lips?
- Thin lips

736
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:13,291
''Yes madam, l remember''

737
01:22:13,292 --> 01:22:15,542
His lips weren't thick.
- Then?

738
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:18,375
They were thin.
- And his ears?

739
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:29,291
Where's Sandy?

740
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:33,291
''Maxi, where's Sandy?''

741
01:22:33,292 --> 01:22:35,750
She's not coming for the shoot today.
- Why?

742
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,750
The police is investigating a murder

743
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:44,875
lnspector Prithvi Singh saw a sketch
made by Sandy. He liked it

744
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:46,750
So?

745
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:52,042
The bartender saw the killer
with Tanya last night

746
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:56,875
lnspector Singh wanted Sandy to make
a sketch from his description

747
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,334
He asked for our help
and l gave my permission

748
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:04,292
You allowed her?
- What's wrong in that?

749
01:23:07,708 --> 01:23:12,208
Nothing wrong

750
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:17,791
And eyes?

751
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:20,500
His eyes... were brown

752
01:23:29,459 --> 01:23:34,374
''What's the matter, Ms Sandhya?''

753
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:37,124
No problem at all...

754
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:42,375
''Actually, l want to go to the loo''

755
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:06,416
''Abby, l'm making your sketch''

756
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:07,334
l know

757
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:10,666
What do l do now?
- Are you crazy?

758
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:13,875
Are you crazy?
You know l didn't kill her

759
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:17,167
''l know, Abby.
But the sketch is almost complete''

760
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:22,416
He's describing your eyes

761
01:24:22,417 --> 01:24:24,958
What you will do is
give those eyes a Chinese look

762
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,917
''Or Japanese, Mongolian...
do anything, but ruin the sketch''

763
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:33,041
l'm coming over

764
01:24:36,334 --> 01:24:41,000
He's insane

765
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:02,125
What are you talking?
- The situation demands

766
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:07,540
The model has to be in the front

767
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:11,209
Any problem in what l said?

768
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:22,749
No... not at all

769
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,833
''Place the cameras and
get the shot ready, l'll be back''

770
01:25:26,209 --> 01:25:27,167
Okay

771
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,499
''Yes, sir?
- l need to talk to you''

772
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,916
''Tell me, sir''

773
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,084
''You knew Tanya, didn't you?
- Damn, everyone is asking me''

774
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,167
You are asking
what the inspector asked me

775
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:48,875
''l'm a guide,
so l knew Tanya''

776
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,458
Well...

777
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,458
l've seen you joking with Tanya
at the airport

778
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:01,125
''Sir, l joke with everyone,
with you too''

779
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:03,708
Tanya used to put me on
to tourist groups

780
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:10,500
''l would help her, too.
l used to arrange cars...''

781
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:15,125
''book tickets during emergencies...
believe me, sir...''

782
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:17,875
she was a nice lady.
- Look Bunty...

783
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:20,707
l won't lie to you

784
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:24,208
l was with Tanya last night

785
01:26:24,209 --> 01:26:28,540
But l did not kill her

786
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:30,791
''Trust me, friend''

787
01:26:30,792 --> 01:26:33,042
''l trust you, sir,
but the police...''

788
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:36,084
That's why l need your help.
- Mine...?

789
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:40,125
''lf the real killer is not found,
the cops will arrest me''

790
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:45,291
Who killed her?
And why?

791
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:49,541
''Sir, you are a gentleman,
and you are in trouble...''

792
01:26:50,167 --> 01:26:53,540
so let me tell you

793
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:56,209
You are right.
l knew the lady well

794
01:26:57,541 --> 01:26:59,583
She wasn't a nice woman

795
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:02,540
She used to meet rotten people

796
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:06,209
Used to visit places
where even angels fear to tread

797
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,415
What kind of places?

798
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:11,875
''Oh come on, tell me.
- l'll tell you, sir''

799
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:16,000
But l request you not to tell anyone.
- l won't

800
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,624
She used to visit Blue Heavens Club

801
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:25,541
You must take me there.
- No way. lt's dangerous

802
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,083
l have no choice

803
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:33,499
You get me?

804
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,374
''Okay, l'll take you there''

805
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,541
''But l won't enter,
l'll drop you outside''

806
01:27:38,917 --> 01:27:43,332
l'll call you at your hotel room
in the evening

807
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:47,791
You killed Tanya!

808
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:51,041
Let go of my hand

809
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:53,166
l didn't kill Tanya

810
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:55,333
l just heard you tell Bunty that
you were with Tanya...

811
01:27:55,708 --> 01:27:57,874
in her room last night

812
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:00,875
That's all you heard? Didn't you
hear me telling l didn't kill her?

813
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,624
Then what were you doing there?

814
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:06,041
She had taken me with her

815
01:28:06,042 --> 01:28:09,207
And you can't ever refuse a girl

816
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:10,958
Are you a kid?

817
01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:13,583
''She held your finger and lead you,
and you couldn't even stop her''

818
01:28:14,625 --> 01:28:17,583
''Abby, the truth is,
you are incorrigible''

819
01:28:19,416 --> 01:28:21,666
''The truth is,
it all happened because of you''

820
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:22,583
What?

821
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:27,875
''After we brawled, l was so upset
that l went to the bar''

822
01:28:28,667 --> 01:28:31,166
l got dead drunk

823
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:33,416
Tanya came along
and took me to her room

824
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:37,207
But nothing happened there
the way you think

825
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:38,832
l'm not thinking

826
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,167
''Besides, it hardly matters
if l imagine things''

827
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:43,249
lt does matter

828
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,208
Why?

829
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:51,125
Because l'm in love with you

830
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:03,207
But unfortunately...

831
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:05,874
l don't love you

832
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:09,125
''ln fact, l don't want to have any kind
of relationship with a person like you''

833
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:50,500
What are you doing here?
- lt's been more than half-hour...

834
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:54,000
Wonder what l ate in the morning...
my stomach is upset

835
01:29:54,834 --> 01:29:59,334
lt's all right

836
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:08,042
Can we have the bartender again?

837
01:30:13,959 --> 01:30:17,500
''You say that his eyes were black,
she says that they were brown''

838
01:30:17,917 --> 01:30:20,500
''Look Mr Prithvi, it's a confusion,
l can't complete the sketch''

839
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:23,499
''No madam, l never said anything''

840
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,874
''Sir, l never saw his eyes''

841
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:29,417
But you said something was black.
What is it?

842
01:30:30,042 --> 01:30:32,374
Black...? Oh no...

843
01:30:32,375 --> 01:30:35,750
l only described his nose and lips

844
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:40,041
''All right,
l'll try again''

845
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:42,417
''Brown eyes, right?
- Brown, right''

846
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:46,749
And... how were his hands?

847
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,291
His hands... he had large hands

848
01:30:51,792 --> 01:30:55,582
ldiot!
- What have you done?

849
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:57,791
Get some fresh papers

850
01:30:57,792 --> 01:31:00,333
''Look, you've ruined the entire sketch''

851
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:05,000
''Mr Prithvi, l'm no robot''

852
01:31:05,375 --> 01:31:09,040
Sketching is hard work

853
01:31:09,041 --> 01:31:14,375
''All right, l'll call you
after two hours''

854
01:31:17,834 --> 01:31:20,208
''Greetings, sir. How are you?
- Yes, l am!''

855
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:22,959
''l'm Nepalese, my father is Nepalese,
my mother is Nepalese...''

856
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,792
my entire family is Nepalese.
What's your problem?

857
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,208
But you don't look like one.
- Damn you! How dare you!

858
01:31:30,542 --> 01:31:35,417
''Forgive me, sir...''

859
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,458
Gajji

860
01:31:55,083 --> 01:31:57,125
''Yes, Mr Gajji... l...''

861
01:31:57,542 --> 01:32:02,708
l'll put it straight.
Where's my stuff?

862
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:04,708
l'll tell you exactly what happened

863
01:32:04,709 --> 01:32:07,417
''Sir, l first met Tanya in the train''

864
01:32:07,834 --> 01:32:09,708
She sat next to me

865
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:11,875
Then l met her at the campfire.
Know what a campfire means?

866
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:16,875
''We collect lots of girls and set them
on fire... l mean, firewood''

867
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:21,083
''Then l met her at the bar,
where l got a bit drunk''

868
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:23,750
''She insisted that l go with her
to her room, so l went over''

869
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:27,875
''She sang a song... a lullaby, in fact.
lt put me to sleep''

870
01:32:28,542 --> 01:32:31,417
''When l woke up,
the poor girl was dead''

871
01:32:31,917 --> 01:32:34,124
''So you see, l didn't do anything''

872
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:37,417
''And sir, what's this stuff?
Wonder what it looks like...''

873
01:32:39,125 --> 01:32:43,040
Bloody windbag

874
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:44,083
Get this

875
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:47,165
You got only six hours

876
01:32:47,166 --> 01:32:49,458
''Only six...? Gajji, you are funny''

877
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:52,125
''ln the morning you said twenty-four
hours, now you're saying six''

878
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,375
Every business has a law.
You are flouting it. This is bad...

879
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:56,625
Shut up!

880
01:32:56,958 --> 01:32:59,165
Return my stuff within six hours

881
01:32:59,166 --> 01:33:02,125
''Else, l'll hack you
into tiny pieces...''

882
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:05,625
''and have them thrown all over Nepal.
- Listen to me, Mr Gajji...''

883
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:09,125
''Listen, you...!
Damn you!''

884
01:33:11,166 --> 01:33:14,040
Why doesn't he listen to me?

885
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:15,125
Sonofagun!

886
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:20,082
''Try to understand me, Mr Gajji...''

887
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:23,666
''Sir, it's Bunty here''

888
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:25,958
Who is Gajji?
- A butcher

889
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:30,166
Butcher?
- The professionals who cut up people

890
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:33,542
''Anyway, where were you?
l've been waiting for you''

891
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:36,834
''Sir, there was so much traffic.
lt's hell out there...''

892
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:42,041
''People over people, cars over cars.
Pokhra has become Mumbai''

893
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:44,542
''What now, tell me?
- How on earth do you know, sir?''

894
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:47,207
''Were you stuck in the jam, too?''

895
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:49,207
''Where are you now, Bunty?''

896
01:33:49,208 --> 01:33:52,250
''At Peva bar, behind the hotel.
Come over, sir''

897
01:33:52,667 --> 01:33:56,417
And... don't come by the lobby.
There are cops waiting

898
01:34:09,166 --> 01:34:11,915
What are you doing?
- Applying sauce

899
01:34:11,916 --> 01:34:15,834
l'm in trouble. The bartender
and the girl were describing Abby

900
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:18,416
l ruined the sketch
at the last moment

901
01:34:18,417 --> 01:34:22,875
Prithvi Singh will call me again
to make the sketch

902
01:34:23,292 --> 01:34:26,916
''l thought l'd apply some sauce, plaster
my hand and tell him that l'm injured''

903
01:34:28,292 --> 01:34:31,166
''l don't know, Sandy''

904
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:36,166
How could Abby do this?

905
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:38,333
''You too think Abby
killed Tanya, do you?''

906
01:34:38,709 --> 01:34:43,000
l myself heard Abby saying that he was
with Tanya in her room last night

907
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:46,500
Abby was in Tanya's room...?
- He says...

908
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:51,292
''he went to the bar after we brawled,
met Tanya and went to her room with her''

909
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:55,375
That doesn't mean he murdered her

910
01:34:56,292 --> 01:34:58,874
''l don't know, Sandy''

911
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:02,916
''l'm so confused, and l think we must
tell everything to the cops''

912
01:35:06,292 --> 01:35:09,750
How can you say this?
He loves you

913
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:14,166
l don't believe it

914
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,584
l'm not sure whether
l must tell you this or not

915
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:20,291
But what little
l know about Abby ;...

916
01:35:20,292 --> 01:35:25,750
''he is really in love with you, Maxi''

917
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:31,209
''And you, too''

918
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:34,833
''Anyway, he's in trouble
at the moment''

919
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:37,124
And he needs us

920
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:40,083
''lf you want
to inform the cops, go on''

921
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:46,291
But l'm not betraying Abby

922
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:04,000
What are you upto now?
- Playing with clothes

923
01:36:05,041 --> 01:36:07,083
Can't you see? l'm making a rope.
- But why?

924
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:11,291
To scale Mount Everest

925
01:36:11,292 --> 01:36:13,166
''Come on, l'm trying to escape''

926
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:15,709
''Are you crazy?
- Yes, l'm insane''

927
01:36:16,167 --> 01:36:19,000
''What difference does it make to you?
Go on, inform the police...''

928
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:22,374
that l killed Tanya

929
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:27,166
He forgot to tie up the other end!

930
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:30,125
''Don't let it go. Tell me whatever
you have to, but help me up''

931
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:56,500
''Thanks for saving my life.
- Oh no, hang on''

932
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:59,333
Don't start brawling again.
She wants to help you

933
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:02,000
That's why she is here.
- Are you kidding?

934
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:04,875
''l'm off.
- Hang on, Maxi''

935
01:37:07,459 --> 01:37:11,958
''Look, if l'm helping you
it doesn't mean that...''

936
01:37:12,417 --> 01:37:14,000
l love you

937
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,999
Where were you going anyway?

938
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,167
To Blue Heavens Club
with Bunty Guide

939
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:27,791
What for?
- Because Tanya used to go there

940
01:37:28,417 --> 01:37:29,375
So?

941
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:33,125
Only there l'll find out
what stuff means

942
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,584
Stuff?
What stuff?

943
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:38,583
Gajji is after it

944
01:37:38,584 --> 01:37:40,916
Gajji?
- Now who's that?

945
01:37:42,708 --> 01:37:44,083
A butcher

946
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,417
Butcher?

947
01:37:47,167 --> 01:37:49,791
''Now look, get this story
for the last time''

948
01:37:50,459 --> 01:37:51,375
l see

949
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:54,624
But why the hell is he after you?

950
01:37:54,625 --> 01:37:59,207
You got no stuff with you

951
01:37:59,208 --> 01:38:00,250
Well said

952
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,499
''What you will do is,
stay here''

953
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:06,167
''When Mr Gajji calls up,
reason with him''

954
01:38:06,542 --> 01:38:09,665
He might just understand you.
- This guy...!

955
01:38:09,666 --> 01:38:12,208
''lf you don't have the stuff,
who has it?''

956
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:15,458
How'd l know?

957
01:38:15,459 --> 01:38:17,916
''Obviously he has it,
who killed Tanya''

958
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:22,665
That's why l was going
to Blue Heavens

959
01:38:22,666 --> 01:38:26,499
Tanya used to frequent it

960
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,499
l'm going with you

961
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,790
lt's very dangerous

962
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:35,082
That's exactly why
l should go with you

963
01:38:35,083 --> 01:38:40,166
''l'm going, too''

964
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:45,250
''Sandy, go right now...''

965
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:49,666
''and call Ram Mohan,
Poornima, Deepti...''

966
01:38:50,125 --> 01:38:52,333
get the entire group.
We'll all go

967
01:38:52,334 --> 01:38:55,333
And listen... don't forget
to bring Pradhan

968
01:38:55,334 --> 01:38:58,541
''lt's going to be fun.
l'll get the camera, too''

969
01:38:58,542 --> 01:39:02,333
Come back here

970
01:39:02,334 --> 01:39:05,292
You think we're having a party?
There will be villains out there

971
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:09,833
You guys are going.
What about my villain?

972
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:13,500
Prithvi Singh. He's going
to call me to make the sketch

973
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:17,666
Why don't you stay in this room?
He won't find out

974
01:39:18,334 --> 01:39:20,791
''Right.
- Okay, l'll change and come''

975
01:39:22,334 --> 01:39:23,292
What for?

976
01:39:25,541 --> 01:39:31,000
''We're going to the club, aren't we?''

977
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:39,540
Club? Dresses?

978
01:39:39,541 --> 01:39:40,541
Women!

979
01:39:52,917 --> 01:39:55,540
There's Blue Heavens Club

980
01:39:55,541 --> 01:39:58,124
l'm not going any further

981
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:02,125
''l tell you, think before you go.
Those people... l mean...''

982
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:05,541
you will find gangsters there.
Your life could be in danger

983
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:11,833
''Your friend is a gangster, too''

984
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:17,082
As you wish

985
01:40:17,083 --> 01:40:20,083
''Shall l wait here?
- No, don't. We'll get back on our own''

986
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:41,208
Weird place

987
01:40:41,209 --> 01:40:43,749
''Weird, it is''

988
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:47,624
But you said we're going to the club

989
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:50,375
This is a club.
This is how clubs hereabouts are

990
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:57,665
But we got to find out
about the stuff

991
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:59,917
Let's go and mingle with them

992
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:46,125
You won't fear anymore...

993
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:50,000
you won't be sad anymore...

994
01:41:50,708 --> 01:41:53,666
you will dance in excitement

995
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,375
Every pain will alleviate

996
01:41:57,875 --> 01:42:03,000
''Come, drag the smoke
right into your heart''

997
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:10,209
You won't fear anymore...

998
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:14,000
you won't be sad anymore...

999
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:17,708
you will dance in excitement

1000
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,416
Every pain will alleviate

1001
01:42:21,833 --> 01:42:27,708
''Come, drag the smoke
right into your heart''

1002
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:42,667
Take a drag

1003
01:42:46,209 --> 01:42:47,833
Pull it

1004
01:43:33,959 --> 01:43:36,750
The night is enchanting

1005
01:43:37,792 --> 01:43:40,333
An intoxication has taken over

1006
01:43:41,541 --> 01:43:43,457
''l'm craving, so are you''

1007
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:45,249
What spell is this?

1008
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:47,124
Raging sparks...

1009
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:52,250
burn me... l give in

1010
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:56,209
Take the flames in...

1011
01:44:02,042 --> 01:44:04,792
pull it in

1012
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:32,583
l have held back my feelings

1013
01:44:33,042 --> 01:44:36,167
Love is just an illusion

1014
01:44:36,875 --> 01:44:40,458
''lt's all a lie, only stories''

1015
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:44,375
''Lose yourself in dreams,
just go wild''

1016
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:51,625
''My friend, take it...''

1017
01:44:53,875 --> 01:44:55,833
drag it

1018
01:44:57,542 --> 01:45:00,875
Take a pull

1019
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:15,542
Pull it

1020
01:45:18,959 --> 01:45:22,667
''Nice song. Must talk a bit now,
someone is coming''

1021
01:45:24,042 --> 01:45:28,875
''You dance well, sing well...
why don't you join the club?''

1022
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:33,500
Club? We're here
for something else

1023
01:45:33,917 --> 01:45:36,541
What's that?

1024
01:45:36,542 --> 01:45:41,500
Stuff.
- Stuff?

1025
01:45:41,875 --> 01:45:44,208
The stuff that goes to lndia

1026
01:45:44,959 --> 01:45:48,542
That guy sells it... that guy...?
- That chap...

1027
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,375
''Tony?
- Tony, exactly''

1028
01:45:51,917 --> 01:45:54,249
''Where's he, of late?
- Want to meet him?''

1029
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:57,124
That's why we're here.
- Come on

1030
01:45:57,125 --> 01:45:58,084
Let's go

1031
01:46:15,875 --> 01:46:18,042
''Who are they?
- He wanted to see you, sir''

1032
01:46:18,959 --> 01:46:21,583
''Would you bring
just about anybody to me, eh?''

1033
01:46:21,959 --> 01:46:23,874
Not anybody

1034
01:46:23,875 --> 01:46:24,834
Abby

1035
01:46:26,416 --> 01:46:31,417
''Abby, from Mumbai''

1036
01:46:31,959 --> 01:46:34,917
l'll put it straight.
l'm here for the stuff

1037
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,999
What stuff?
- Stuff

1038
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,583
''What stuff?
- Stuff, stuff''

1039
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,124
''What stuff, l'm asking you''

1040
01:46:47,125 --> 01:46:49,874
Are you new in business?

1041
01:46:49,875 --> 01:46:52,207
Don't know what stuff means?

1042
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:53,916
''Come on, stuff...''

1043
01:46:53,917 --> 01:46:54,875
Okay

1044
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,999
How did you get here?

1045
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:03,207
You and l got a common friend

1046
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,291
Gajji

1047
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:08,959
He said you're good at supplying

1048
01:47:11,042 --> 01:47:13,792
So you're Gajji's friend?
- Yes

1049
01:47:14,208 --> 01:47:19,041
l also knew Tanya

1050
01:47:19,042 --> 01:47:21,165
''Yes, Gajji?''

1051
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:23,124
Where's my stuff?

1052
01:47:23,125 --> 01:47:25,165
l told you!
l gave it to Tanya

1053
01:47:25,166 --> 01:47:27,041
''Look, don't chew my brains''

1054
01:47:27,042 --> 01:47:30,000
Tanya used to work for you.
Didn't she?

1055
01:47:31,542 --> 01:47:34,124
lt's worth 100 million.
My 100 million!

1056
01:47:34,125 --> 01:47:36,458
''Cut the crap.
- Crap, eh?''

1057
01:47:36,834 --> 01:47:39,040
She slept with one and all

1058
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:42,083
''lf l find that guy,
l'll kill him right there''

1059
01:47:42,542 --> 01:47:43,542
Sit there

1060
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:47,792
''No. You guys solve your problem,
l'll make a move''

1061
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:51,040
Who is this?
- Your friend

1062
01:47:51,041 --> 01:47:53,083
He's come from Mumbai.
- Are you crazy?

1063
01:47:54,166 --> 01:47:56,958
He's my friend?

1064
01:47:56,959 --> 01:48:00,375
''Gajji, easy, friend.
Don't drag me into your problem''

1065
01:48:00,709 --> 01:48:03,208
Smartass! Who the hell are you?

1066
01:48:03,583 --> 01:48:05,667
This is what you lack.
Every business has a law

1067
01:48:06,041 --> 01:48:08,624
And you're not a man of your word

1068
01:48:08,625 --> 01:48:11,208
Smartass! So it was you
who was in Tanya's room

1069
01:48:12,208 --> 01:48:15,041
''Don't piss me off, okay?
- What will you do?''

1070
01:48:15,917 --> 01:48:18,208
What will you do? Tell me.
- l'll tell him

1071
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:20,999
What will you tell him?
- l'll tell him

1072
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,083
Tell him what? Go ahead.
- l'll tell him that...

1073
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,709
l saw you in Tanya's room and you
tried to strike a deal with me...

1074
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:29,165
''You're lying, swine!
- Gajji''

1075
01:48:29,166 --> 01:48:31,625
Did you meet Tanya?
- They are enemies

1076
01:48:31,959 --> 01:48:34,082
ls the stuff with you?
- What are you talking?

1077
01:48:34,083 --> 01:48:36,709
''l've been working with you since
ten years, did l ever cheat you?''

1078
01:48:37,083 --> 01:48:39,208
''l wasn't in Tanya's room,
he was...''

1079
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:49,541
''Now, you go after him''

1080
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:13,375
Duck!
Now run

1081
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:44,375
''lf the swine is hit,
l'll lose my 100 million''

1082
01:50:01,125 --> 01:50:06,375
Tony! Listen to me

1083
01:50:17,292 --> 01:50:19,958
''Abby, look there...
- Switch off the torchlight!''

1084
01:50:23,208 --> 01:50:25,792
l told you not to shoot

1085
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:29,207
''lf he dies, will you
give me 100 million?''

1086
01:50:29,208 --> 01:50:33,541
l was only scaring him

1087
01:50:33,542 --> 01:50:36,750
Why did you switch on the torchlight?
- l was trying to find a way

1088
01:50:37,125 --> 01:50:42,084
lnside the house?

1089
01:51:00,125 --> 01:51:01,167
Rats!

1090
01:51:05,333 --> 01:51:08,584
Don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him!

1091
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:12,667
Don't shoot him!
Don't you guys understand?

1092
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:33,374
You're scared of rats?

1093
01:51:33,375 --> 01:51:36,208
l'm only scared of rats.
- What if l died?

1094
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:41,208
You forgot switching on
the torchlight? Lighthouse!

1095
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:47,458
l was only looking
for a place to hide

1096
01:51:49,791 --> 01:51:50,916
Where to?

1097
01:52:19,125 --> 01:52:22,459
God! Did l hit you?
- What have you done? You shot him

1098
01:52:22,875 --> 01:52:24,332
''Hang on, l'm talking''

1099
01:52:24,333 --> 01:52:27,916
You shouldn't have come in between.
- Give him his fees back

1100
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:33,792
Stupid! Get the hell out of here

1101
01:52:39,375 --> 01:52:42,083
l don't care about
the money involved. He's deadmeat

1102
01:52:42,625 --> 01:52:47,374
''No, Tony''

1103
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:49,833
D'you know how much 100 million is?

1104
01:52:55,208 --> 01:52:58,416
''Whose car is this?
- Ours, for now''

1105
01:52:58,417 --> 01:53:00,709
l didn't know that. How will you
start the car without keys?

1106
01:53:03,375 --> 01:53:07,125
To start a car without keys
is the only thing l learnt in college

1107
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:16,625
Hit the tyre! The tyre!

1108
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:33,374
Don't run... easy.
We're inside the hotel

1109
01:53:33,375 --> 01:53:36,374
They'll track us down

1110
01:53:36,375 --> 01:53:41,667
Must leave for lndia right now

1111
01:53:42,542 --> 01:53:44,624
ls there a flight to lndia
at this hour?

1112
01:53:44,625 --> 01:53:47,207
''There's one, sir''

1113
01:53:47,208 --> 01:53:50,334
''Book two tickets for us, please.
- Sorry, l can't do that''

1114
01:53:50,708 --> 01:53:51,708
Why not?

1115
01:53:51,833 --> 01:53:55,334
''As per police instructions,
nobody can check out''

1116
01:53:56,417 --> 01:53:59,708
Shall l talk to the police...?
- On second thoughts...

1117
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:03,416
we're not in a hurry to go to lndia

1118
01:54:03,417 --> 01:54:05,625
We can leave after a couple of days.
- Yes?

1119
01:54:06,042 --> 01:54:08,833
Yes. We got to do a lot of things.
Mountaineering...

1120
01:54:09,208 --> 01:54:11,833
''trekking, got to meet
uncle Tony and uncle Gajji, too''

1121
01:54:12,417 --> 01:54:14,958
How are we to go back to lndia?
- How'd l know?

1122
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:22,833
She saved me.
Tell me something ;...

1123
01:54:23,250 --> 01:54:25,833
what's she doing outside
so late in the night?

1124
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:29,041
''Now don't tell me
you went into her bedroom, too''

1125
01:54:29,042 --> 01:54:31,542
''Yes sir, l took a good look.
lt's him''

1126
01:54:31,916 --> 01:54:34,208
''You're saying that the couple
is with the lndian crew, right?''

1127
01:54:34,584 --> 01:54:39,249
''Yes, sir. They had come
to the travel desk too''

1128
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:41,292
''Ashok, seal the entire hotel''

1129
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:57,208
''Sandy, no one is going
to suspect you''

1130
01:54:58,208 --> 01:55:01,916
Get a car somehow.
Meet us at the old market

1131
01:55:02,542 --> 01:55:04,750
l and Maxi will be there.
- All right

1132
01:55:05,042 --> 01:55:07,167
Are the two of you all right?
- Ram...

1133
01:55:07,584 --> 01:55:10,042
''get confirm tickets
for tomorrow's flight, for the crew''

1134
01:55:10,417 --> 01:55:13,459
lt'll be done.
But what about the two of you?

1135
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:18,291
We'll have to find a way
to get out of Nepal

1136
01:55:18,292 --> 01:55:20,958
''We don't have a choice, Abby.
Only by air, but that Prithvi...''

1137
01:55:22,292 --> 01:55:25,041
l'll manage

1138
01:55:25,042 --> 01:55:27,459
''Sandy don't worry, trust me''

1139
01:55:43,708 --> 01:55:49,000
''Mr Abby, open the door''

1140
01:55:50,083 --> 01:55:55,125
''Mr Abby, open the door''

1141
01:56:05,125 --> 01:56:09,541
''Don't move, l'll slip, stupid.
- Just, hang on''

1142
01:56:10,459 --> 01:56:13,500
Didn't you find a better place
to take my pants off?

1143
01:56:15,375 --> 01:56:18,917
Nepal was your idea.
30 percent cheaper

1144
01:56:19,334 --> 01:56:21,417
This is much cheaper.
- Why blame me?

1145
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:24,750
''Go on, dance with Tanya,
go to the bedroom''

1146
01:56:29,417 --> 01:56:34,333
l won't.
- You won't?

1147
01:56:34,334 --> 01:56:36,540
Stand straight!

1148
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:39,291
Give me your hand

1149
01:56:39,292 --> 01:56:40,500
Come up

1150
01:56:41,583 --> 01:56:45,791
You're so fat.
Ever believed in dieting?

1151
01:56:46,875 --> 01:56:49,209
''Let me come up,
l'll fix you''

1152
01:56:50,375 --> 01:56:52,750
As if you are a body builder

1153
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:59,333
''Give me a hand, Abby!''

1154
01:56:59,334 --> 01:57:04,834
Ruined my dress

1155
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:09,124
This leads to the kitchen.
- l know

1156
01:57:09,125 --> 01:57:11,334
Damn! Why is he roaming here?

1157
01:57:12,042 --> 01:57:13,957
''l'm on duty, sir''

1158
01:57:13,958 --> 01:57:17,250
''But l know everything. Not an
lndian waiter, you are a cheater''

1159
01:57:17,625 --> 01:57:20,458
''Listen, l'm in serious trouble.
Can you help me?''

1160
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:22,874
l'll give you anything you ask for.
- Sure?

1161
01:57:22,875 --> 01:57:23,875
Sure

1162
01:57:24,375 --> 01:57:28,958
All right. l have a dream.
A highrise building...

1163
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:33,000
''You want to own one?
- Oh no, sir. l want to be its guard''

1164
01:57:36,417 --> 01:57:38,707
Do you know Bunty?
- Bunty?

1165
01:57:38,708 --> 01:57:41,124
''Bunty, the guide.
- Yes, l know him''

1166
01:57:41,125 --> 01:57:43,417
Where does he stay?
- Beyond the hills

1167
01:57:44,209 --> 01:57:46,708
Where?
- Beyond that hill is a smaller hill

1168
01:57:47,125 --> 01:57:49,457
Beyond that is an even smaller hill...
- Do you know the place?

1169
01:57:49,458 --> 01:57:51,457
l do.
- Can you take us there?

1170
01:57:51,458 --> 01:57:53,416
Sure.
- Let's go

1171
01:57:53,417 --> 01:57:56,292
Oh no! There are cops that side.
ls there no other way?

1172
01:57:56,666 --> 01:57:58,665
There is. Come on

1173
01:57:58,666 --> 01:58:01,292
''Ram, l'm worried.
Abby isn't here as yet''

1174
01:58:01,666 --> 01:58:03,875
May be they are held up

1175
01:58:04,541 --> 01:58:08,000
We mustn't have left them stranded.
What if something happens to them?

1176
01:58:10,666 --> 01:58:13,625
He will find a way out
to get out of Nepal

1177
01:58:18,708 --> 01:58:19,625
Goodness

1178
01:58:25,541 --> 01:58:30,542
Where's Abby?

1179
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:34,209
Bunty...
- Sir? Here?

1180
01:58:34,708 --> 01:58:37,624
Thank God l found you

1181
01:58:37,625 --> 01:58:38,833
So late?

1182
01:58:41,583 --> 01:58:45,167
''What are you doing here at this hour?
- Bunty, we're in real trouble''

1183
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:48,416
There was a mess up at Blue Heavens.
Goons are after us

1184
01:58:48,833 --> 01:58:53,708
''l told you, it's a hell-spot,
but you wouldn't agree''

1185
01:58:54,167 --> 01:58:56,334
What can l do?
- Look Bunty...

1186
01:58:56,708 --> 01:59:00,042
''all we got to do is,
get out of Nepal''

1187
01:59:01,292 --> 01:59:04,500
''You want to get out of Nepal,
but l have to stay here''

1188
01:59:04,917 --> 01:59:07,334
l'll be killed.
They'll come after me

1189
01:59:07,708 --> 01:59:11,833
''Apart from you, we don't know anyone
who can get us out of Nepal''

1190
01:59:14,583 --> 01:59:16,666
''Sir, you've come asking me for help''

1191
01:59:18,209 --> 01:59:21,333
A guest is like God

1192
01:59:22,667 --> 01:59:24,084
l'll try

1193
01:59:25,917 --> 01:59:26,875
Hurry back

1194
01:59:35,333 --> 01:59:40,458
The day is about to dawn

1195
01:59:40,541 --> 01:59:43,333
''lf you are telling the truth,
why did Abby run off?''

1196
01:59:43,792 --> 01:59:46,500
He should've informed the police.
- The circumstance was such

1197
01:59:46,875 --> 01:59:50,250
Tony and Gajji were after him.
- Do you know?

1198
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:53,916
Tony is the biggest
dealer in drugs hereabouts

1199
01:59:53,917 --> 01:59:57,458
''Which means, the stuff...?
- Yes, it must be the drugs''

1200
01:59:57,917 --> 02:00:00,375
lf Tony is after Abby...

1201
02:00:00,792 --> 02:00:03,541
then he'll surely find him.
Pokhra is a small place

1202
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,750
''What are we supposed to do, sir?
- Why didn't you tell me before?''

1203
02:00:07,917 --> 02:00:13,000
Come with me

1204
02:00:27,959 --> 02:00:30,959
''Where are we going?
- Don't worry, sir''

1205
02:00:31,541 --> 02:00:34,667
There's a bungalow on the other side.
l'll drop you there

1206
02:00:35,084 --> 02:00:38,500
l'll come in the evening
and help you cross the border

1207
02:00:38,875 --> 02:00:41,792
But you won't venture out
in the interim

1208
02:00:42,167 --> 02:00:47,584
''Even if a bird spots you,
you will be in trouble''

1209
02:00:53,375 --> 02:00:55,583
Get down... easy

1210
02:01:15,625 --> 02:01:18,416
Sandy and Ram Mohan
must be waiting for us

1211
02:01:18,875 --> 02:01:21,416
''Don't worry, l'll inform them''

1212
02:01:37,875 --> 02:01:40,624
''ls this the bungalow?
- Yes, sir''

1213
02:01:40,625 --> 02:01:41,625
Come on in

1214
02:01:44,875 --> 02:01:47,874
lt's a bit dirty

1215
02:01:47,875 --> 02:01:50,500
A bit?
- lt's only a matter of few hours

1216
02:01:50,875 --> 02:01:54,042
You will be out of Nepal
and away from trouble

1217
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,416
''But Bunty, you said
we'll be alone here''

1218
02:02:00,875 --> 02:02:04,041
Who else is here then?

1219
02:02:04,042 --> 02:02:06,625
At least a couple of hundred spirits

1220
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,166
Abby! You've got
a bad sense of humour

1221
02:02:09,625 --> 02:02:11,707
''Keep talking, l'll leave''

1222
02:02:11,708 --> 02:02:13,916
Please come back soon

1223
02:02:13,917 --> 02:02:17,333
And don't give me the bull
that you are so good at

1224
02:02:17,708 --> 02:02:19,958
''About traffic jams, Pokhra, Mumbai...
- You're joking''

1225
02:02:19,959 --> 02:02:24,166
''l must leave now.
Please don't venture outside, okay?''

1226
02:02:26,834 --> 02:02:29,833
Don't venture out?

1227
02:02:29,834 --> 02:02:33,291
lf we stay inside
any longer...

1228
02:02:33,667 --> 02:02:36,625
we'll become like them.
Like the spirits living here

1229
02:02:46,208 --> 02:02:51,584
Where's the toilet?

1230
02:02:54,542 --> 02:02:57,500
''Well, the haunted place
has come of good use''

1231
02:03:00,084 --> 02:03:04,541
''You're still joking, aren't you?''

1232
02:03:04,542 --> 02:03:05,583
Maxi...

1233
02:03:06,542 --> 02:03:09,041
l live in the present moments

1234
02:03:09,042 --> 02:03:12,749
You are with me

1235
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:18,208
l may be dead the next moment

1236
02:03:53,708 --> 02:03:56,041
Come on.
- l'm not coming

1237
02:03:56,042 --> 02:03:59,250
That's Veer Singh's mansion.
- Come on! Veer Singh's mansion!

1238
02:04:00,333 --> 02:04:02,165
Not inside! Not inside!

1239
02:04:02,166 --> 02:04:07,041
''Stop droning, and say something''

1240
02:04:07,042 --> 02:04:11,749
''Not in Chinese, talk in Hindi''

1241
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:14,666
''He says, this place is haunted''

1242
02:04:14,667 --> 02:04:15,625
Shut up!

1243
02:04:16,208 --> 02:04:19,000
''Have you seen a ghost?
- Yes, l have''

1244
02:04:19,792 --> 02:04:22,333
How does it look?
- Large eyes..

1245
02:04:22,917 --> 02:04:25,458
''long hair, clad in white...''

1246
02:04:25,917 --> 02:04:31,292
Cut the crap and get inside

1247
02:04:34,208 --> 02:04:36,290
Now what's gotten into you?

1248
02:04:36,291 --> 02:04:40,917
''Tony, this is the time. Show the world
that spirits are only fake''

1249
02:04:41,291 --> 02:04:43,625
''Carry on, go inside,
l'll wait here''

1250
02:04:45,875 --> 02:04:46,834
Okay

1251
02:04:47,083 --> 02:04:50,332
The swine's terrified

1252
02:04:50,333 --> 02:04:53,750
Where the hell are you going?
You want me to stand here alone?

1253
02:04:54,875 --> 02:04:58,208
''Don't shoot him, Tony.
lt's a matter of 100 million''

1254
02:05:00,125 --> 02:05:05,541
Praise the lord

1255
02:05:05,875 --> 02:05:09,458
We have guests. l guess we'll
have to ask the spirits for help

1256
02:05:24,041 --> 02:05:27,375
Can't see anything.
- Ghosts can't be seen

1257
02:05:28,333 --> 02:05:29,291
Shut up

1258
02:05:40,125 --> 02:05:42,417
''Strange place.
People don't come here, l guess''

1259
02:05:50,083 --> 02:05:54,250
There's has been no guests here
since 200 years

1260
02:05:55,125 --> 02:05:58,667
l told you!
This is Veer Singh's mansion

1261
02:05:59,125 --> 02:06:02,040
Now that you are here...

1262
02:06:02,041 --> 02:06:04,542
But who is she?
Mrs Veer Singh?

1263
02:06:04,917 --> 02:06:07,207
Please go back to bed

1264
02:06:07,208 --> 02:06:09,375
Please go to bed.
We won't ever come back

1265
02:06:12,208 --> 02:06:13,166
Listen...

1266
02:06:14,208 --> 02:06:17,165
how does one recognise a ghost?

1267
02:06:17,166 --> 02:06:22,625
A ghost's feet are reversed

1268
02:06:26,958 --> 02:06:28,749
''Gajji-bhai, tell me something''

1269
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:31,333
What brand of shoes
must they be wearing?

1270
02:06:34,166 --> 02:06:35,125
Taba

1271
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:48,207
What are they doing?

1272
02:06:48,208 --> 02:06:50,499
l'll go inside

1273
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:53,166
Where the hell are you going?
Don't leave me alone

1274
02:07:11,041 --> 02:07:11,958
Scoot!

1275
02:07:52,458 --> 02:07:54,542
lt's been long
since this thirsty land...

1276
02:07:55,375 --> 02:07:58,249
was deprived of even
a droplet of rain

1277
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:00,875
Looks like
a storm is kicking up today

1278
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:03,958
We'll get a bottle
of mineral water for you

1279
02:08:04,458 --> 02:08:07,667
She's messing up her lines

1280
02:08:08,041 --> 02:08:10,457
She seems to be seducing them.
lt's time for me to show up

1281
02:08:10,458 --> 02:08:12,500
''Lord, have mercy on us''

1282
02:08:19,417 --> 02:08:22,000
Couldn't you find a better dialogue?

1283
02:08:31,292 --> 02:08:32,250
Lord!

1284
02:08:33,292 --> 02:08:35,541
''Lord, get me out of here''

1285
02:08:35,542 --> 02:08:38,875
''Lord, get me out of here.
l don't want the 100 million''

1286
02:08:43,083 --> 02:08:46,500
''Should l get out of here, l swear,
l'll quit all illegal activities''

1287
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:49,833
''l swear, l'll quit''

1288
02:08:51,208 --> 02:08:52,416
Who's there?

1289
02:08:52,417 --> 02:08:54,542
Why isn't anybody there?
Tony!

1290
02:09:24,333 --> 02:09:27,332
That was the Chinese

1291
02:09:27,333 --> 02:09:32,167
He's quiet again?

1292
02:09:33,375 --> 02:09:34,292
Chang...

1293
02:09:50,167 --> 02:09:55,333
''Where are you, Tony?''

1294
02:10:16,208 --> 02:10:21,167
Gajji! Bastard!

1295
02:10:28,417 --> 02:10:29,417
Good Lord!

1296
02:10:32,833 --> 02:10:33,791
Lord!

1297
02:10:41,417 --> 02:10:43,833
''Tony, l didn't kill you, l swear''

1298
02:10:44,208 --> 02:10:47,542
''lt's a haunted place,
the ghosts had you killed''

1299
02:10:49,375 --> 02:10:51,666
l'm getting out of here.
To hell with 100 million

1300
02:10:52,042 --> 02:10:54,416
''Who's there?
- Hang on, pal''

1301
02:10:54,417 --> 02:10:57,708
l've been expecting you

1302
02:10:59,042 --> 02:11:04,375
At last you are here

1303
02:11:25,708 --> 02:11:29,416
Do ghosts fire...?

1304
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:48,499
''Bunty, you?''

1305
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:50,957
''Yes, it's me, sir''

1306
02:11:50,958 --> 02:11:52,665
You killed him?

1307
02:11:52,666 --> 02:11:55,041
''Yes, l killed him''

1308
02:11:55,042 --> 02:11:57,665
How did they know we're here?

1309
02:11:57,666 --> 02:12:02,959
l told this guy

1310
02:12:06,375 --> 02:12:10,416
Are you okay?

1311
02:12:10,417 --> 02:12:14,541
l informed them

1312
02:12:14,542 --> 02:12:17,541
l had gone to
her bedroom that night...

1313
02:12:17,542 --> 02:12:22,541
to pour my heart out to Tanya

1314
02:12:22,542 --> 02:12:24,666
You?
- Yes

1315
02:12:25,292 --> 02:12:27,541
Sorry for dropping in at this hour

1316
02:12:27,542 --> 02:12:30,500
l have something important to say

1317
02:12:34,875 --> 02:12:37,167
Go on. What is it?

1318
02:12:37,541 --> 02:12:41,500
Actually... this room is so beautiful

1319
02:12:42,541 --> 02:12:47,459
At three in the night
you come to tell me about my room?

1320
02:12:47,833 --> 02:12:49,917
''Oh no, l... Ms Tanya...''

1321
02:12:50,375 --> 02:12:54,042
''Hurry up with it, Bunty.
l'm drowsy''

1322
02:12:54,459 --> 02:12:56,665
''Ms Tanya, l'll tell you''

1323
02:12:56,666 --> 02:13:02,334
''We've been working together for years.
And you know, a guide has to lie''

1324
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:07,167
''But l'm not lying to you,
it's from the bottom of my heart''

1325
02:13:07,541 --> 02:13:10,125
l like you.
You are so pretty

1326
02:13:11,541 --> 02:13:14,042
''l like you too, Bunty''

1327
02:13:14,541 --> 02:13:17,541
You must go now. Good night.
- l'm in love with you

1328
02:13:22,791 --> 02:13:24,833
l madly love you

1329
02:13:26,375 --> 02:13:28,875
''Bunty, maybe you're drunk. Tomorrow...
- Oh no''

1330
02:13:29,292 --> 02:13:32,541
l just drank a little
to muster some courage

1331
02:13:32,917 --> 02:13:35,250
''Look Bunty, there's somebody inside.
- With you?''

1332
02:13:35,625 --> 02:13:38,209
''Go away, Bunty.
- Even if there are ten men with you...''

1333
02:13:38,583 --> 02:13:40,374
l don't mind

1334
02:13:40,375 --> 02:13:43,209
Because l know that they are here
only till morning comes

1335
02:13:43,583 --> 02:13:46,417
''Bunty, just go away.
- l want to marry you''

1336
02:13:46,791 --> 02:13:49,541
''Just go away, Bunty.
- l'll be lucky to have you as my wife''

1337
02:13:49,917 --> 02:13:54,375
''l swear, l'll be most happy...
- Bunty, get out of here''

1338
02:13:58,042 --> 02:14:00,791
How dare you touch me?

1339
02:14:00,792 --> 02:14:03,000
How could you imagine
that l'm in love with you?

1340
02:14:04,417 --> 02:14:07,874
Have you ever seen a mirror?

1341
02:14:07,875 --> 02:14:10,167
l just spoke
a few good things to you...

1342
02:14:11,042 --> 02:14:13,167
and you think l'm in love with you?
- Don't say that

1343
02:14:13,541 --> 02:14:15,583
You are just a guide for me.
Only a two-penny worth guide!

1344
02:14:15,958 --> 02:14:17,832
You're humiliating me.
- Get out of here

1345
02:14:17,833 --> 02:14:21,042
''Don't say that, please.
- l don't want to see your face again!''

1346
02:14:21,417 --> 02:14:24,832
Enough! No more!

1347
02:14:24,833 --> 02:14:27,208
Don't say that

1348
02:14:27,209 --> 02:14:30,209
l pour my heart out to you

1349
02:14:30,666 --> 02:14:33,374
And you talk about my looks

1350
02:14:33,375 --> 02:14:34,625
l am...

1351
02:14:36,666 --> 02:14:38,540
What's this?

1352
02:14:38,541 --> 02:14:40,208
You're bleeding

1353
02:14:40,209 --> 02:14:41,209
Oh no!

1354
02:14:41,666 --> 02:14:44,625
''How could this happen?
Oh, what have l done?''

1355
02:14:46,416 --> 02:14:49,167
''Ms Tanya, get up for once, please''

1356
02:14:54,666 --> 02:14:57,665
And after that...

1357
02:14:57,666 --> 02:15:01,125
l picked the corpse up...

1358
02:15:02,541 --> 02:15:07,499
''and placed it i bed, beside you''

1359
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:09,874
''Which means, you killed Tanya''

1360
02:15:09,875 --> 02:15:11,707
l didn't kill Tanya

1361
02:15:11,708 --> 02:15:13,000
You did

1362
02:15:14,708 --> 02:15:18,334
You've ruined my life.
l'm tired now

1363
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:21,458
You turned a simple guide
into a murderer

1364
02:15:21,958 --> 02:15:24,334
''Which means, you are the one
who directed Tony and Gajji here''

1365
02:15:24,708 --> 02:15:25,957
''Yes, l did''

1366
02:15:25,958 --> 02:15:28,416
l stole the stuff from Tanya's room

1367
02:15:29,458 --> 02:15:31,875
Then l set Gajji behind you

1368
02:15:32,334 --> 02:15:35,416
l thought Gajji and Tony
will see the end of you

1369
02:15:35,833 --> 02:15:37,707
But the swines...!

1370
02:15:37,708 --> 02:15:40,292
l understand this much

1371
02:15:40,708 --> 02:15:43,833
No one helps another
in this world

1372
02:15:44,209 --> 02:15:48,334
One has to do it all alone.
l'm confused no more

1373
02:15:48,708 --> 02:15:51,707
Now l'm going to kill you

1374
02:15:51,708 --> 02:15:53,833
''Bunty, listen to me...
- One minute, lady''

1375
02:15:54,209 --> 02:15:56,582
l beg of you

1376
02:15:56,583 --> 02:15:59,000
Please do not interfere

1377
02:15:59,875 --> 02:16:01,917
l'm just not interested in you

1378
02:16:02,458 --> 02:16:04,583
''Sorry, but you can leave''

1379
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,375
Tell me one thing.
lf l were to make love to you now...

1380
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:11,125
''with this dog watching us,
how would you feel?''

1381
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:13,540
You want me to make love to her?
- Listen...

1382
02:16:13,541 --> 02:16:15,791
there was nothing of that sort
between me and Tanya

1383
02:16:15,792 --> 02:16:18,874
''Nothing? Nothing, really?''

1384
02:16:18,875 --> 02:16:20,749
''Bloody cur! Nothing, really?''

1385
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:23,499
''lt hurt, right?''

1386
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:27,375
Blood was spurting out of her head

1387
02:16:27,750 --> 02:16:30,540
l was shuddering like crazy

1388
02:16:30,541 --> 02:16:34,500
''l was crying, and you were
enjoying your sleep''

1389
02:16:38,792 --> 02:16:41,708
All that made the difference
was the face

1390
02:16:42,125 --> 02:16:44,167
Tanya loved your looks

1391
02:16:44,541 --> 02:16:46,874
Let me cut up that face

1392
02:16:46,875 --> 02:16:50,167
l'll be at peace
only if l scratch that bloody face

1393
02:16:50,541 --> 02:16:55,958
Let me send you to the heavens

1394
02:17:00,875 --> 02:17:02,874
''You are right, Bunty''

1395
02:17:02,875 --> 02:17:07,458
''lf l were in your shoes,
l'd do the same thing''

1396
02:17:09,209 --> 02:17:11,332
''l can understand your pain, brother''

1397
02:17:11,333 --> 02:17:12,250
Brother?

1398
02:17:12,917 --> 02:17:15,667
Are you trying to mislead me?
You are going to die now

1399
02:17:16,084 --> 02:17:20,833
l'm not sparing you

1400
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:26,541
All right!

1401
02:17:26,875 --> 02:17:29,832
You're going to kill me anyway

1402
02:17:29,833 --> 02:17:32,458
So why don't you listen to truth
before you do it?

1403
02:17:34,416 --> 02:17:36,792
''Yes, l had slept with Tanya''

1404
02:17:38,833 --> 02:17:41,500
''And everything that you imagine,
happened''

1405
02:17:42,917 --> 02:17:45,625
''Not you, Tanya was in love with me''

1406
02:17:46,042 --> 02:17:49,208
She madly loved me

1407
02:17:49,209 --> 02:17:51,333
Before you propositioned her...

1408
02:17:51,875 --> 02:17:52,833
swine...

1409
02:17:53,209 --> 02:17:55,291
you should've taken a look
at yourself in the mirror

1410
02:17:56,708 --> 02:17:58,833
Damn you!
You look like a bloody dog

1411
02:17:59,375 --> 02:18:00,375
Cur!

1412
02:18:34,875 --> 02:18:36,874
Crazy swine

1413
02:18:36,875 --> 02:18:39,332
He just couldn't read it

1414
02:18:39,333 --> 02:18:41,375
There was nothing
between me and Tanya

1415
02:18:42,375 --> 02:18:43,333
Honestly

1416
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:47,125
''Let's get out of here, Abby.
Come on''

1417
02:18:47,792 --> 02:18:48,750
Come on

1418
02:19:51,542 --> 02:19:54,124
''What are you doing, Abby?''

1419
02:19:54,125 --> 02:19:56,708
Just checking.
He might just rise again

1420
02:19:57,125 --> 02:20:02,417
Can't trust this chap

1421
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:11,833
''Tell me something, Abby''

1422
02:20:11,834 --> 02:20:14,291
Did nothing really happen
between you and Tanya?

1423
02:20:17,625 --> 02:20:18,583
Good Lord

1424
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:20,959
Woman!

1425
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,083
There they are!
- They are here. Climax!

1426
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,834
''Abby, are you all right?
- l'm perfectly all right''

1427
02:20:27,208 --> 02:20:29,959
''Where are Gajji and Tony?
- Maxi, l hope you are not hurt?''

1428
02:20:30,875 --> 02:20:33,500
You are terribly hurt.
- Easy

1429
02:20:33,917 --> 02:20:35,959
We'll talk about it after...

1430
02:20:54,125 --> 02:20:56,040
Love is crazy...

1431
02:20:56,041 --> 02:20:58,333
''l realised only after l fell in love
with you, sweetheart''

1432
02:20:59,041 --> 02:21:01,166
l can't live...

1433
02:21:01,792 --> 02:21:04,207
if living is without my beloved

1434
02:21:04,208 --> 02:21:06,040
Not mine...

1435
02:21:06,041 --> 02:21:08,792
it's the call of my heart

1436
02:21:09,375 --> 02:21:14,833
So what do you think?

1437
02:21:14,834 --> 02:21:17,000
So what do you think?

1438
02:21:18,041 --> 02:21:23,541
l'm in love with you

1439
02:21:52,875 --> 02:21:56,375
''You are my life, my romance''

1440
02:21:58,083 --> 02:22:02,041
You rejuvenate my love

1441
02:22:03,333 --> 02:22:08,500
''When l mention you,
my heart skips a beat''

1442
02:22:09,041 --> 02:22:12,792
''l can't help it,
my heart is restless''

1443
02:22:13,333 --> 02:22:15,375
So what do you think?

1444
02:22:18,917 --> 02:22:21,667
So what do you think?

1445
02:22:22,125 --> 02:22:27,583
l'm in love with you
