00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:27,183
I will tell you everything.

4
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:32,971
I saw a kid crying.

5
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:37,897
His father died for he was a drunkard.

6
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:42,251
The kid stands all alone crying.

7
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:48,731
I saw that child has grown up.

8
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:55,571
Many men and women are with him.

9
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:59,440
There are all standing in a church.

10
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,629
Absolutely right, Ma'am.

11
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,480
I'm a guide, so usually
people flock around me.

12
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,291
I also pay visit to church dally.

13
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:09,891
But I want to be an affluent man.
I've a else way to go.

14
00:03:09,938 --> 00:03:13,211
My past is gone.
What is my future? Tell me!

15
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:31,427
I can visualise your princess...

16
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:36,931
your dream girl,
whom you were waiting till this day.

17
00:03:38,994 --> 00:03:41,247
That blue eyed damsel...

18
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,571
slim and beautiful.

19
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:52,540
Smilingly she steps towards you.

20
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:56,188
You're going with her.

21
00:03:56,418 --> 00:03:57,463
Abroad.

22
00:03:57,765 --> 00:04:05,368
I also see an airplane
zooming high in the sky.

23
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:08,291
Sonia,
the flight is delayed for 5 hours.

24
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:10,527
5 hours.

25
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:13,295
Shall we go to the lounge?

26
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,811
No granny, you go ahead.
I'll go to the bookshop and come.

27
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:37,243
- A strange husband you are Phiroze.
- Of course!

28
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,472
Our silver wedding anniversary and
you take me to some other place.

29
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:46,886
No darling, I'm taking you to
the same old place, sunset point.

30
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:48,740
Oh so sweet.

31
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,447
You are taking me to Marriate
island, aren't you?

32
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:55,051
Right. Our same old hotel
is there on Marriate island.

33
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:58,824
No, it's not there.

34
00:05:58,871 --> 00:06:00,520
It's 25 years since
we are married...

35
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,554
and you forgot where we
had celebrated our honeymoon.

36
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:04,837
We celebrated at lakeside
Marriate island.

37
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:08,907
- Honeymoon! Honeymoon was just beautiful!
- Thank you.

38
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:12,431
- But darling, this time you're wrong.
- I am always right.

39
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,143
No darling I am the
boss. I am right.

40
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:17,760
- I know you are the boss. No darling, it is there.
- No.

41
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,920
- I am telling you it is there.

42
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,611
Excuse me. May I?

43
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:24,413

45
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,506
I was going to tell you
the same thing.

46
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,810
Just a minute, how so you know?
Are you from Malaga?

47
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,980
No, I've never been there.

48
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,387
I am from Austria.

49
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:41,736

00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,393
Hi, Tony! How are you?

82
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:27,850
- One suite room, please.
- It's not vacant.

83
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,691
Then vacate it, Martin.

84
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,920
You know who they are?
They come from Australla.

85
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,980
Not Australla, Austria.

86
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:37,479
Whatever it is Aunt. For him both
are foreign countries for him.

87
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,470
- Vacate the room Martin.
- Tony, try to understand.

88
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:42,655
It is very difficult for me.

89
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:44,523
Hey try to make it man!

90
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:46,865
Tony, if there is no suite
then a double room will do.

91
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:49,511
How can it be madam, the room
should be as big as the guest.

92
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:52,063
It's the question of commission.
Hey Martin, make it, man.

93
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,831
- One suite room please.
- Tony, one more please.

94
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,717
Tony! Okay!

95
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:05,636
If our Tony has said it then
something will have to be done.

96
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:08,449
After all we've to stay in Malagha.

00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,544

- Thank you so much Tony.

00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,922

She is beautiful! She is mind blowing!

109
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,045
She is just...

110
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,833
She is mind blowing.

111
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,228
Commission man!
We'll settle the accounts later.

112
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,620
After all you are my friend.

113
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,539
I don't want any relation with you.
C'mon, Martin clear my accounts.

He says, I'm his friend! Cheating me,

117
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:40,585
The girl has come. Where am I?

118
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:42,537
I am unconscious!

119
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:45,861
My heart says, go boom! Boom!

120
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:50,838
Hey Neena! Where are you,
bloody basket of flowers?

121
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:55,528
- Hey Neena!
- Tony pick up the jacket.

122
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,772
You dog!
Am I going to pick up this cap?

123
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,214
- Where are you, my friend?
- Donkey, monkey, idlot fool!

124
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:02,940
What do you think yourself?

125
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,253
- From where is she talking? Where is she?
- Scoundrel! 420!

126
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:07,493
Trying to boss over!
Trying to act smart.

127
00:12:07,613 --> 00:12:09,258
- Where are you? Face me.
- I'll show you.

128
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:12,055
I've served you in all the
possible ways since childhood.

129
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,992
And you've never ever gifted
a one penny chocolate to me.

130
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:17,440
Never took me for an outing!
Do you take me to be your wife?

131
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,323
From today your food
is stopped! Finish!

132
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:22,628
Now you tell me sorry.

133
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,919
Neena, I hope you aren't dead!

134
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:28,970
Oh Neena darling!
You have become a cat!

135
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:31,265
While you were allve you were a cat...

136
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:34,318
and after death also you have
become a cat. Oh my cat!

137
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,574
Neena my darling, stupid idlot.

138
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:50,273
Tony, don't hit me or else
I'll keep you starving.

139
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:52,132
Is it? I'll eat you raw.

140
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,289
No tea for you.
I won't even wash your clothes.

141
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:57,698
- Okay, I'll employ a new maid.
- What? I am a servant.

142
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:01,798
- Time please! Time please!
- Apologise first.

143
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,758
Ok sorry Tony.

144
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,183
From where did you get this cat?

145
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:08,453
A tourist was selling it.
It also contains...

146
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,336
- a tape recorder.
- Really.

147
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,744
Record some good things in it,
I'll hear it later.

148
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,210
Why did you waste your money
for the tape recorder?

149
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:18,860
- I can talk straight forward with you.
- Right? Now, say...

150
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:24,109
Stupid! Idlot! Fool! Donkey!

151
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,069
Tony! I'll kill you.

152
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:29,949
- Vasu and Sapna have gone to commit suicide again.
- Oh shit!

153
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,962
- Do you know, nanny?
- Yes.

154
00:13:36,204 --> 00:13:44,204
I felt as though Mom would
welcome me at the airport.

155
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:53,271
I felt Mom touched me as the...

156
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,543
warm breeze fondled me.

157
00:13:56,324 --> 00:14:01,563
You never saw your mother and
still you love her so much.

158
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:08,421
- Mom was a nice lady, wasn't she?
- Indeed!

159
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,044
Then why didn't she
go to Austria with papa?

160
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,826
For she didn't want
to leave India.

161
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:18,147
Where did she live in Malaga?

162
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:21,292
I don't know.

163
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:25,586
Don't break your promise.

164
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:31,490
Atleast tell me where
my mothers grave is.

165
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,994
Please tell me, nanny...
this is not the past it's the present.

166
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:47,123
A human body perishes but not...

167
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:51,529
their memories. Please tell me.

168
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:56,950
Nanny please! Please.

169
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:09,749
She is in the room,
but why doesn't she come.

170
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:25,936
You are doomed, Tony!

171
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:34,762
You fool everyone. But that
girl has taken you for a ride.

172
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:42,157
Damn it, what a beautiful smile!

173
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:44,439
It feels as though a bottle
of fenny has been uncorked.

174
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,458
- Good morning.
- Morning.

175
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:10,284
- How are you?
- What!

176
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,693
Sorry! I'm speaking to
you in local language.

177
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,860
- I mean. How are you?
- Fine.

178
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,151
- Couldn't be better.
- Good. Good.

179
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:21,052
- Your Mom is not to be seen.
- My Mom has expired.

180
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,696
She was fine till yesterday.

181
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,077
That's my nanny.

182
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:34,747
Okay, your grandmother. Atleast
you've someone to call your own.

183
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:38,674
She is my governess. She has
brought me up since I was a child.

184
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,956
- Why didn't she come?
- No. Her feet are aching.

185
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:45,399
- I'll come alone.
- Good, good.

186
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,906
By the way Madam, Goa is
famous for three things.

187
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:50,835
It's churches, beaches and the
third I'm sorry to...

188
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,277
say the fenny here. And you prefer?

189
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:56,709
- I want to go here.
- You want to go here.

190
00:16:57,305 --> 00:17:00,189
You want to go here!

191
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:03,493
I'm illiterate, Ma'am

192
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,198
Marble island, Tony okay.

193
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:50,297
- Hello.
- Sonia my baby I am missing you. I love you.

194
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:52,465
Fine thank you. How are you, father?

195
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:55,432
Don't worry about me.
I am fine darling.

196
00:17:55,628 --> 00:17:57,479
How's your shopping going on?

197
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,447
How did you find Singapore?

198
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:04,539
- Papa.
- Yes my child.

199
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,070
I'm in Malaga not in Singapore.

200
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,359
Why? You know I hate that place.

201
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:20,274
I know, papa. I didn't want to hurt
your feelings.

202
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:23,596
But the flight had
to land at Bombay.

203
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:28,622
So I thought, I must once
Visit Mom's...

204
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:34,305
Give the phone to nanny.

205
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,271
Yes, papa.

206
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:44,696
Yes sir. Yes sir.

207
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,795
Right sir.

208
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,405
Sir has allowed us to stay
in Malaga for a few days.

209
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:00,292
Happy?

210
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,804
Good morning madam.

211
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:13,924
Tony!

212
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:16,790
Ok I'll be ready in a minute.

213
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,152
No problem Ma'am.
Tony will not go anywhere.

214
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,908
Everybody comes from some
or the other place.

215
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:38,648
Everybody wants only one guide,
Tony and no one else.

216
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:43,815
Ma'am what shall I say? Today
you are looking very beautiful!

217
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:49,541
Your goggles are very nice
and it's suits you.

218
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:53,978
And the way your hair is flying...
it looks so beautiful.

219
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,094
I also like Gucci goggles.

220
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:57,971
- Tony!
- I always buy Gucci goggles.

221
00:19:58,011 --> 00:19:58,619
Stop.

222
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,500
What's wrong Ma'am?
Stop the car. Stop the car!

223
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:02,649
Can't you hear? Stop the car.

224
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,898
Tony, I did not tell
you to stop the car...

225
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:09,857
I told you... stop talking.

226
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,124
People from all over the world
come here to listen to me.

227
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:15,053
And you tell me to shut up.

228
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,881
So that,
I can also say something.

229
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:24,920
So go ahead. Let the nectar
flow through your words!

230
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:31,222
Tony,
I've to find my Mom's grave.

231
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,653
Your Mom's grave!

232
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,260
Here, in Malaga! Where?

233
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,457
That I don't know.

234
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,604
No problem Ma'am.
Tell me your Mom's name.

235
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:49,133
I'll find her grave.

236
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,927
You people spoil the
name of Malaga.

237
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:16,221
Come on, madam.

238
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:23,673
What a place! Beautiful!

239
00:21:24,947 --> 00:21:26,712
Madam, if you've a heart
enough and strength...

240
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:30,168
Tony will show you such locations
which will be beyond your imagination.

241
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,210
No one is as good as you.

242
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:42,327
You're my love... my life.

243
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:46,114
I'm all your's...
don't take me for wrong

244
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:49,011
Tony, now how far?

245
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,209
Far away...
where there's beauty.

246
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:53,689
As you tread further in life,
you'll find life more beautiful.

247
00:21:55,174 --> 00:21:57,751
Seriously Tony...
Now where else, Tony?

248
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,533
There's blue island further.

249
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:02,356
Where is it?

250
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:04,307
- Can I show you?
- Yes.

251
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,787
Fancy t-shirt! Wow!

252
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:12,809
- Malaga!
- Malaga!

253
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:17,261
- Ma'am, see we are here.
- Yes.

254
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:19,709
- And we've to reach there.
- Yes.

255
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:22,426
- From here to there.
- Right. - So go straight.

256
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:26,560
It's difficult to reach there.

257
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:28,417
- Is it?
- Yes.

258
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:30,281
- Now...
- Now, you try.

259
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:34,950
- We are here, we've to reach there.
- Yes.

260
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,560
- And come little up.
- Straight up.

261
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:44,711
It's difficult. We've to ride
the motorboat right and left.

262
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,854
- Shall I show you?
-

263
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:47,665
- How?
- Now start. Come up.

264
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,896
Stop.

265
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:58,611
- Come down.
- This is going far.

266
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:18,149
This is going very far.

267
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,789
This is the way the motorboat goes.

268
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,264
We're off! Here goes the bike.

269
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:34,671
- And here we reach.
- We've reached.

270
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,913
- Blue island.
- Blue island.

271
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:39,823
- At last we've reached blue island.
- Let's go.

272
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:54,488
How did you find King prawns?
It's quite famous.

273
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,139
People come all the way
from Bombay to have this.

274
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,557
Is it?
But why aren't you having it, Tony?

275
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:03,166
We Indians have a different style.

276
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:06,343
We love to feed other people.

277
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:10,681
During festivals we treat
our guests very generously.

278
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,219
On the arrival of a newborn
we offer everyone sweets.

279
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:15,992
We invite people for meal while
conducting the death anniversary.

280
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:19,669
You can say in India,
people rarely die of starvation.

281
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:22,002
For mostly people
die of over eating.

282
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,826
- How do you find it?
- Is it good?

283
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,040
- Excellent!
- I like everything around here.

284
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,333
Tell me the truth, what do you like?
While eating, one mustn't lie.

285
00:25:30,357 --> 00:25:34,058
I'm not lying.
The churches here are good...

286
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,084
The beaches are good,
the people...

287
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,464
and Tony I like you a lot.

288
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,535
Thank you, Ma'am.

289
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,769
Thank you so much.

290
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,049
I visuallse a fairy.

291
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,967
Beautiful, blue eyed damsel.

292
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:12,764
Smiling! She is with you.

293
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:06,606
I'm trying to build
India's reputation...

294
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:12,367
and you scoundrel
you are bent on disrespecting it.

295
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:17,898
- C'mon, apologize to her.
- Sorry! And me?

296
00:28:22,638 --> 00:28:24,604
Tony! You also carry a revolver?

297
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:41,800
Tony, you are such a good actor,
my hero.

298
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:03,203
Hey! You take away my heart!

299
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:06,840
Hey! You take away my life!

300
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,335
Hey! You take away my heart!

301
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,595
Hey! You take away my life!

302
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:17,061
This decision of the heart is
done with a lot of difficulty.

303
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:21,025
Why doesn't my lover agree with me?

304
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,625
Hey! You take away my heart!

305
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,890
Hey! You take away my life!

306
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,326
This decision of the heart
is done with a lot of difficulty.

307
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:35,318
Why doesn't my lover agree with me?

308
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:39,232
Hey! You take away my heart!

309
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:59,887
If the weather teases you...

310
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:03,911
then how can anyone escape?

311
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:07,480
Like the wonderful fragrance...

312
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,398
we both are similar to that.

313
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:14,639
You have taken away
my senses, my beloved.

314
00:30:14,683 --> 00:30:18,023
Hey! You take away my heart!

315
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:21,525
Hey! You take away my life!

316
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:24,825
This decision of the heart
is done with a lot of difficulty.

317
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:28,892
Why doesn't my lover agree with me?

318
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:32,875
Hey! You take away my heart!

319
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:07,752
There is some magic in your eyes...

320
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:11,783
whoever they looks at,
they make him crazy.

321
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:15,326
You are a bit crazy.

322
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:18,287
You are a floating cloud.

323
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:22,438
No one knows my pain here.

324
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:26,029
Hey! You take away my heart!

325
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,311
Hey! You take away my life!

326
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:32,755
This decision of the heart
is done with a lot of difficulty.

327
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:36,722
Why doesn't my lover agree with me?

328
00:31:36,785 --> 00:31:40,158
Hey! You take away my heart!

329
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:43,649
Hey! You take away my life!

330
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:46,870
This decision of the heart
is done with a lot of difficulty.

331
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:51,031
Why doesn't my lover agree with me?

332
00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:54,980
Hey! You take away my heart!

333
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:17,578
Gabru, why are you
always seen in winter wear?

334
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:23,201
I told you, I feel the psychological
chill for the whole year.

335
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:26,880
Neena, Tony is not be
seen around nowadays.

336
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,100
Don't you know, he is a guide?
He must be with his tourist.

337
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,872
No. Listen...

338
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:37,180
he in not guiding the tourist.
She is a girl.

339
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,018
She is guiding him. Yesterday,
he was dancing around with her.

340
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:43,965
- Did you see?
- Yes. He was roaming with his hand around her waist.

341
00:32:45,391 --> 00:32:47,191
- Hey! What's wrong with you?
- C'mon, get up.

342
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:48,621
Time not over.

343
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,858
Get lost from here.

344
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:53,330
Oh Neena please understand.

345
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:56,005
I love you.
That's why I am telling you.

346
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:58,545
Discard Tony's thoughts
off your mind. Marry me.

347
00:32:58,621 --> 00:33:00,433
Tony is not your cup of tea. Yes.

348
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:04,072
- Will you please get out?
- Excuse me. - Get out.

349
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:07,991
- Get out.
- Why do you hit me.

350
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:21,813
Hey! Neena! Neena!

351
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:27,768
Dear, what to say...
that Madam... she is too good!

352
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:29,258
You will be happy to meet her.

353
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,384
And the biggest highlight
in her that she is not hot tempered.

354
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:32,978
Being so beautiful,
she is not hot tempered.

355
00:33:33,002 --> 00:33:35,763
And today she did something amazing!
Today she offered me to dance with her

356
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:38,311
I danced in such a way
that she was stunned.

357
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:40,065
Did you cook?

358
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:42,194
- I've served your food.
- Very good.

359
00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:45,248
Had it not been for you,
I'd have starved.

360
00:33:57,836 --> 00:34:00,655
Wow! Neena!

361
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:05,829
She is not good looking
but she is useful.

362
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:38,828
Hey Neena. Neena.

363
00:34:39,337 --> 00:34:41,309
Hey Nee... na.

364
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:46,708
Hey Nee... Nee... Nee... na.

365
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,678
- Tony, what happened?
- Water!

366
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:52,650
- Water?!
- Why was the food as such?

367
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:56,306
- Here's the water. Only for you.
- That's the water from the flush.

368
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,969
Is this a glass?
Throw it away! Give me clean water.

369
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:04,925
- Give me water.
- I'll not give you water.

370
00:35:05,543 --> 00:35:07,557
Tell me,
what do I hear about this Madam.

371
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:10,073
Nothing. She's my customer.
What else?

372
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:13,052
I wash your clothes...
cook for you...

373
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:15,085
And you enjoy with the Ma'am, eh?

374
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,002
There's no harm in dancing with her.

375
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:20,961
- Leave my hand.
- C'mon, get me some water.

376
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,813
You may die of hiccups,
but I won't give you water.

377
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,060
- Die okay.
- Neena please! Neena!

378
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:29,831
What do you think of yourself?

379
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:37,509
Stupid! Idiot!
You bloody basket of flowers!

380
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:44,337
Leave me. I will kill you.

381
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:49,829
It's so peaceful here, isn't it?

382
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,168
You people are so lucky.

383
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,875
You don't have any problems in life.

384
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:58,093
- Damn the luck! What are you talking?
- Really?

385
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:00,818
- I couldn't sleep the whole night.
- Why?

386
00:36:01,074 --> 00:36:03,314
Hadn't I reached on time
they would've committed suicide.

387
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,741
- Who?
- Vasu and Sapna, my friends.

388
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:09,042
They love each other.

389
00:36:09,243 --> 00:36:13,021
Their parents don't
allow them to meet.

390
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,416
Whenever they get a chance
and tread into their dream world...

391
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,117
this world doesn't
let them live in peace and...

392
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,429
God doesn't let them die.

393
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:27,192
But no one can stop lovers.
They usually try to die.

394
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:32,465
Vasu too met the same fate.
He didn't listen to anyone.

395
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:36,153
He shouted and told the world... Bye...

396
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:39,312
- we are going from this world.
- Tony, you'll fall.

397
00:36:39,354 --> 00:36:40,709
I was trying to make him see reason.
But he didn't listen.

398
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:43,778
- Tony, come down.
- I requested him in the same way.

399
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:46,353
- Tony please!
- I kept requesting him in the same way...

400
00:36:46,393 --> 00:36:48,818
but he did not listen to me.

401
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:54,969
Tony. Tony.

402
00:36:55,843 --> 00:36:58,397
Oh God! Help!

403
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,725
Water! That should help!

404
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:03,725
This water is dirty. Mineral.

405
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:07,263
- Use Mineral, Ma'am.
- You rascal.

406
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:26,235
- Good morning ma'am.
- Hey good morning.

407
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:29,211
- Very good morning ma'am.
- Let's go.

408
00:37:30,656 --> 00:37:33,389
But... Where's the car?

409
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:37,617
Oh! So what?
Then, let's go on the bike.

410
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:42,861
Will my bike do? Who is that?

411
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,241
- Nobody is there.
- Let's go.

412
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:52,812
- Hold me.
- Sure.

413
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:04,548
- I will take you Malaga in 2 hours.
- I see.

414
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:07,729
What is the matter
you are looking very beautiful.

415
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,713
Today is my birthday.

416
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:13,166
- Many happy returns of the day.
- Thank you.

417
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:16,989
- How old are you?
- You should never ask a girl her age.

418
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:20,269
But you aren't old.
Why should you hide your age?

419
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:24,073
Very charming. All right.
I'll tell you... 24

420
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,971
I am also tell you 24 years old.
One short for a silver jubilee.

421
00:38:56,748 --> 00:39:03,657
- Happy birthday to you... 24 are done? 24 are done?
- Finally!

422
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:17,651
- Happy birthday Sonia.
- Papa.

423
00:39:21,648 --> 00:39:22,648
Papa!

424
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:40,303
Happy birthday, my dear Sonia.
I am missing you terribly.

425
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:49,318
I am eating your birthday cake.
May God give you a else life.

426
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:54,309
Sonia, your Dad has send
this cassette from Vienna.

427
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,276
He told me to play
it as soon as you come.

428
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,338
So Neena, ultimately good night.

429
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,589
Thanks Gabru, so nice of you.

430
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:20,570
Neena, I want to say that...
I love you.

431
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:24,107
Hey fink! You propose
to every second girl you see.

432
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:26,460
What do you think of yourself?
Ever looked at yourself in mirror?

433
00:40:26,484 --> 00:40:29,684
Why are you jealous? He wasn't
talking about your girl friend.

434
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:32,860
You can never be my girl friend.
Ever seen yourself?

435
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,719
You are thin like a prawn fish.

436
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:40,426
I, a prawn fish!
And what about your madam?

437
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,201
She is a mermaid, is she?

438
00:40:42,321 --> 00:40:45,504
Indeed! She is a mermaid.
She is so beautiful!

439
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,727
Have you ever seen her?

440
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:50,948
Her eyes..., hair..., her smile...
Everything of hers is beautiful!

441
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:52,122
She's a princess!

442
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,051
Damn your princess!
Bloody idiot!

443
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:57,292
You haven't seen her, isn't it?
Look at her snap.

444
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,395
I was dancing with her. Look...

445
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:01,029
Get lost!
I don't want to see it.

446
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:05,457
- I'm getting wild. I'm leaving.
- You'll stay here.

447
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:10,100
Get lost or else I'll break your legs.

448
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:12,789
Look! I'm also someone's child.

449
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:16,434
Child, eh! You can father
a couple of children! Get lost!

450
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:20,549
- Get lost!
- Move... - Get lost!

451
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:29,389
- Do you think yourself Prince. Ever looked at yourself?
- Get lost!

452
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:32,917
- She considers herself as Samantha Fox.
- Idiot!

453
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,171
- She thinks herself beautiful.
- Your madam...

454
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,554
She does not get the right guy.

455
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:28,810
Tony, what's so special
about her that I lack?

456
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:37,744
You lack courage.

457
00:42:39,372 --> 00:42:42,546
You love me,
but you've never expressed it.

458
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:44,939
Had Madam been in your place...

459
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,119
she would've accepted before
the whole world that she loved me.

460
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:51,277
She'd have danced and screamed.
Know why?

461
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:55,109
Because she's quite bold.
Not like you.

462
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:15,499
Your veil slipped away from your head.

463
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:42,364
Your veil slipped away from your head.

464
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:48,949
Your veil got stuck to me.

465
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:53,523
The magic of your
love has been cast on me.

466
00:43:53,643 --> 00:43:57,116
I have no control over my heart.

467
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:04,749
My veil slipped away from my head.

468
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:11,749
My veil got stuck to you.

469
00:44:12,802 --> 00:44:16,265
The magic of your
love has been cast on me.

470
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:19,735
I have no control over my heart.

471
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:27,975
Your veil slipped away from your head.

472
00:44:49,175 --> 00:44:55,800
Wonder when you stole
my peace of mind, I did not realize.

473
00:44:56,228 --> 00:45:03,288
You have made me crazy
by giving me sleepless nights.

474
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:06,879
My sight has not shifted
even for a moment...

475
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,359
since it has seen you.

476
00:45:10,593 --> 00:45:13,796
Don't act crazy...

477
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:17,342
you have my swear.

478
00:45:19,105 --> 00:45:24,789
My veil slipped away from my head.

479
00:45:26,078 --> 00:45:31,895
My veil got stuck to you.

480
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:36,515
The magic of your
love has been cast on me.

481
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:40,449
I have no control over my heart.

482
00:45:41,777 --> 00:45:48,149
Your veil slipped away from your head.

483
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,377
What state have you made of mine...

484
00:46:20,497 --> 00:46:23,146
the pain does not go.

485
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:27,456
There is a fogginess in my thoughts...

486
00:46:27,505 --> 00:46:30,428
I do not get consciousness.

487
00:46:30,886 --> 00:46:37,410
What sort of colour has
spread on me of love.

488
00:46:37,831 --> 00:46:44,347
I have just realized about your love.

489
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:52,269
Your veil slipped away from your head.

490
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:59,149
Your veil got stuck to me.

491
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:03,690
The magic of your love
has been cast on me.

492
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,585
I have no control over my heart.

493
00:47:09,024 --> 00:47:12,418
- From your head...
- Yes, from my head.

494
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:18,829
Your veil slipped away from your head.

495
00:47:34,135 --> 00:47:37,874
- Good morning.
- Tony I'll kill you.

496
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:42,014
Bloody basket of flowers.
Tony you are monkey.

497
00:47:54,742 --> 00:47:58,483
Ma'am this is Malaga's grand beach.

498
00:47:59,882 --> 00:48:02,130
Many activities like boating,
yachting, rowing...

499
00:48:02,486 --> 00:48:04,416
romancing goes on here.

500
00:48:06,497 --> 00:48:09,381
Leave it...

501
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:12,032
What are you doing, Ma'am?

502
00:48:12,152 --> 00:48:14,535
- I'll ride the bike.
- Have you driven before?

503
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,158
No. I'll ride it for
the first time today.

504
00:48:16,182 --> 00:48:18,093
No, don't do it. In fact say,
I'll try it for the first time.

505
00:48:18,117 --> 00:48:19,578
But it is a really nice bike.

506
00:48:19,618 --> 00:48:21,844
Don't take risk Ma'am.
The bike is new.

507
00:48:22,087 --> 00:48:27,527
I've to pay the
remaining six installments.

508
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,737
So what?
You can teach me.

509
00:48:31,544 --> 00:48:32,544
I?
Teach you?

510
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:35,834
I'll teach you.
I don't mind.

511
00:48:37,716 --> 00:48:43,738
One minute.
Move a little ahead.

512
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:49,404
Now keep you right foot here...
and left foot here.

513
00:48:52,868 --> 00:48:54,670
One minute.

514
00:49:23,508 --> 00:49:25,433
I am sorry, I am sorry.

515
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:27,975
- What happened?
- The bike broke down.

516
00:49:28,046 --> 00:49:30,576
- Why has it stopped?
- It has run out of petrol Ma'am.

517
00:49:31,194 --> 00:49:32,534
Now what?

518
00:49:32,654 --> 00:49:37,516
Now only two things are possible.
One, we both sing together.

519
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:43,101
Or else we've to take refuge
in some hut like in Hindi films.

520
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:47,175
Cut it out, Tony! Come on let's go
and ask for a life. Let's go.

521
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:53,503
Madam, one minute... Bike...

522
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:00,258
Angels in the night.
Exchanging glances.

523
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:04,456
Wandering in the night.
Whatever chances.

524
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:17,803
Hey! What are you doing?
Getting a cart in the hotel?

525
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,114
A cart is not allowed in.

526
00:50:20,282 --> 00:50:21,503
But I can get the bike Atleast.

527
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:23,807
Bullock cart is not
allowed in a five star hotel.

528
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:26,202
I know.
But a bike is allowed, isn't it?

529
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:27,567
You can bring a bike.

530
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,849
- Then, I've brought the bike.
- But this is a cart.

531
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,781
- This is a bike.
- Why did you confuse us?

532
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:34,912
Catch him.
He has kidnapped Sonia.

533
00:50:34,952 --> 00:50:36,657
What are you saying?

534
00:50:36,709 --> 00:50:39,353
Return my Sonia or
else I'll strangle you.

535
00:50:39,399 --> 00:50:42,251
Talking about strangling me, eh!

536
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:44,064
Her father is a rich man.

537
00:50:44,184 --> 00:50:48,686
- I know. He must be about 60 years old.
- She's a princess.

538
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:53,479
You will position your hands properly!

539
00:50:54,116 --> 00:50:57,026
Your princess is sleeping there.

540
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:58,747
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

541
00:50:58,795 --> 00:51:02,271
Hey, you people too?
You've ruined my reputation.

542
00:51:10,492 --> 00:51:11,672
Have we reached.

543
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:22,241
- My reputation is ruined.
- Thank you, Tony.

544
00:51:22,556 --> 00:51:25,116
I'll never forget
this day my entire life.

545
00:51:26,081 --> 00:51:28,162
What is the need
to thank me, ma'am?

546
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,000
I too will not forget this day.

547
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:33,729
- Good night.
- Good night.

548
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:43,146
Tony, don't come from tomorrow
we'll look out for another guide.

549
00:51:44,128 --> 00:51:47,171
But aunty... Damn it!

550
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:52,116
I don't understand.

551
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:55,629
Why is a flower always
accompanied by a thorn?

552
00:51:57,883 --> 00:52:00,513
She is a thorn!
Very big thorn!

553
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,816
Bad luck!

554
00:52:06,565 --> 00:52:11,565
I'm also here since morning
but couldn't catch a fish.

555
00:52:11,605 --> 00:52:15,159
And your basket, it's full.
I'm unfortunate.

556
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:20,021
Whenever I think that something
good is going to happen in my life...

557
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:22,562
something or the
other untoward happens.

558
00:52:23,188 --> 00:52:26,151
Now, what's the problem with you?

559
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:31,200
Don't you get tense.
Nanny told me...

560
00:52:31,738 --> 00:52:34,156
she'll change the guide.

561
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:37,204
I'll not go there now.
I told her to change the guide.

562
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,507
- I'll not talk to Madam too.
- Really? Promise!

563
00:52:40,842 --> 00:52:45,229
I swear on you! I challenge.
I will never talk to her.

564
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:47,234
- Tony!
- Yes, Madam...

565
00:52:47,274 --> 00:52:50,756
How can... Welcome!
Where are you?

566
00:52:51,889 --> 00:52:55,076
- How come you have come.
- I just came searching for you.

567
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,676
You are angry.
So I must coax you.

568
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,348
I'm not angry with you.
I can never be angry with you.

569
00:53:03,402 --> 00:53:05,798
What are you saying?
I'll die if I do so.

570
00:53:05,854 --> 00:53:10,615
I'll die if I do so. One
doesn't get angry on near one's.

571
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,294
Ma'am. This is Neena.
Neena. Yea ma'am.

572
00:53:19,582 --> 00:53:21,596
Tony is full of praises for you.

573
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:22,736
Heard that?

574
00:53:22,776 --> 00:53:24,953
But Tony has never told
me anything about you.

575
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:28,421
- Hey! Liar! She is such a big liar!
- Tony! - Tony! Don't worry.

576
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:31,092
Ma'am, I always think about you.

577
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:33,339
- Be frank you had your breakfast?
- Yes.

578
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,615
- Had your lunch?
- Yes.

579
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:38,066
- He worries so much!
- I have to!

580
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:41,271
- Did you have your milk?
- Yeah!

581
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:47,253
Here there is a lot of tension.
Like this.

582
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:49,276
I think, he's talking about himself.

583
00:53:49,303 --> 00:53:51,731
Saw?
She learnt how to talk because of me.

584
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:54,291
- May I tell you?
- Yes

585
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,547
I'm tensed because of only two people.

586
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,042
One is Neena and the
other is your nanny. You don't mind?

587
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:03,624
- No of course not.
- Then come. - See you Neena.

588
00:54:03,664 --> 00:54:07,596
I've to see her that is the
problem of my life. Come, come.

589
00:54:16,508 --> 00:54:18,840
- The temple of Lord Krishna and Radha.
- Oh!

590
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,237
- The symbol of love. Come.
- Come.

591
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:55,322
- What's this?
- This is total surrender. - Oh!

592
00:55:16,871 --> 00:55:19,196
- Okay.
- Not you...

593
00:55:19,563 --> 00:55:22,696
- Why Tony?
- Not you.

594
00:55:25,306 --> 00:55:27,756
You will do it when you wear a sari.

595
00:55:32,115 --> 00:55:34,751
- Now.
- It is offerings.

596
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,230
- Ma'am. - Tony.
- Ma'am.

597
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:57,164
- It's really bad.
- What?

598
00:56:00,096 --> 00:56:02,325
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Why?

599
00:56:02,365 --> 00:56:04,158
- I don't wish to speak to you.
- But why Tony?

600
00:56:04,182 --> 00:56:09,084
I searched for you everywhere.
In temple... in church...

601
00:56:09,204 --> 00:56:10,990
I asked everyone about you.
But I couldn't trace you.

602
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:12,129
But Tony, in Goa I...

603
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:14,405
What if something
had happened to you?

604
00:56:14,445 --> 00:56:15,950
I'd have been disgraced in Goa.

605
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:21,484
I'd have been the talk of the town.

606
00:56:21,675 --> 00:56:24,943
Where can I go in Goa?
I was on the beach.

607
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,580
You should've taken me.
Why did you go alone?

608
00:56:28,634 --> 00:56:30,590
Alright. I'll remember.
Take this.

609
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:34,350
- Very bad.
- Present, Tony. Present.

610
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,659
- For me?
- Just like that.

611
00:56:37,913 --> 00:56:41,677
- Costly?
- Did you like it? Tell me.

612
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:46,192
Rs. 6000/-!

613
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,990
- Who sold this scarf to you for 6000/-?
- Let it be. Wear it and show me.

614
00:56:50,545 --> 00:56:52,436
A scarf worth Rs. 6,000/-!

615
00:56:53,084 --> 00:56:57,826
In this much...
I've no heart to wear it.

616
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,420
Not this way.

617
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:07,834
Wear it this way.
You'll look good.

618
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:14,355
Raise you head.

619
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:22,599
You are looking so good.

620
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:25,473
Shall I tell you something, Ma'am?

621
00:57:26,403 --> 00:57:29,487
No one has ever gifted me this way.

622
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,641
- Worth six thousand rupees!
- But you are looking handsome.

623
00:57:33,936 --> 00:57:35,168
So cute.

624
00:57:39,988 --> 00:57:43,996
I was unaware of the magic of love.

625
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:48,725
I'm besotted and fanatical.

626
00:57:49,002 --> 00:57:53,100
You are crazy, you did
not reallze this much.

627
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:58,610
You are besotted and fanatical.

628
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:19,720
I was unaware of the magic of love.

629
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:24,225
I'm besotted and fanatical.

630
00:58:24,649 --> 00:58:28,498
You are crazy,
you did not realize this much.

631
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:33,035
You are besotted and fanatical.

632
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:37,388
I was unaware of the magic of love.

633
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:41,909
I'm besotted and fanatical.

634
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:46,389
You are crazy,
you did not realize this much.

635
00:58:46,788 --> 00:58:51,863
You are besotted and fanatical.

636
00:59:13,352 --> 00:59:17,653
You stay in my eyelids.

637
00:59:17,773 --> 00:59:22,324
All night yesterday,
I dreamt about you.

638
00:59:22,372 --> 00:59:26,745
How do I tell you?
How restless I was!

639
00:59:26,865 --> 00:59:31,299
I did not have peace
for even a moment.

640
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:37,230
My heart tells me, that it is
difficult to explain anything to you.

641
00:59:38,058 --> 00:59:42,121
You are besotted and fanatical.

642
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:46,352
I was unaware of the magic of love.

643
00:59:46,812 --> 00:59:50,867
I'm besotted and fanatical.

644
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:56,241
You are crazy,
you did not realize this much.

645
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:22,355
What magic have
you cast on my heartbeats?

646
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:26,822
My crazy mind has started dancing.

647
01:00:26,897 --> 01:00:31,356
When I look at you, I feel loved.

648
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:35,835
When I take the name of God,
your name comes before that.

649
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:42,033
You have a right over my life.
I was unaware about all this.

650
01:00:42,564 --> 01:00:46,671
I'm besotted and fanatical.

651
01:00:47,072 --> 01:00:51,056
You are crazy,
you did not realize this much.

652
01:00:51,221 --> 01:00:55,421
You are besotted and fanatical.

653
01:00:55,878 --> 01:00:59,803
I was unaware of the magic of love.

654
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:04,398
I'm besotted and fanatical.

655
01:01:04,518 --> 01:01:08,841
You are besotted and fanatical.

656
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:13,957
I'm besotted and fanatical.

657
01:01:30,046 --> 01:01:34,422
Ma'am! Ma'am!
I've good news for you.

658
01:01:39,874 --> 01:01:43,459
I hope you'll not be sad.

659
01:01:44,328 --> 01:01:49,176
- Why? What happened?
- I've found your mother's grave.

660
01:01:50,017 --> 01:01:51,822
You won't be sad?

661
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:55,678
Will you come with me?

662
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,511
That one.

663
01:02:18,612 --> 01:02:20,191
- Madam...
- Yes...

664
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:22,295
This is from my side.

665
01:04:26,248 --> 01:04:29,073
The sunset is so beautiful!
And you look so depressed.

666
01:04:29,754 --> 01:04:33,532
Just smile once and all
your sorrows will vanish away.

667
01:04:34,012 --> 01:04:37,032
- You know how to flirt very well.
- No, I am speaking the truth.

668
01:04:37,242 --> 01:04:40,671
If you don't believe me,
then see for yourself.

669
01:04:42,243 --> 01:04:44,393
I'm feeling depressed today.

670
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:45,759
Why?

671
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:50,553
Now my job is over.
I'll have to go.

672
01:04:51,993 --> 01:04:53,661
You will go away?

673
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:57,947
There's no reason to stay back.

674
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:02,230
I'll miss you a lot, Tony.

675
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:11,618
I'll take a snap of yours.
Stand there.

676
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:14,454
Go. Go.

677
01:06:49,013 --> 01:06:50,372
- Hello! How are you?
- Hello Mr. Prem Arya?

678
01:06:50,396 --> 01:06:52,233
He is Mr. Khan. Indian ambassador.

679
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,451
Anyway, what's the schedule?

680
01:07:02,604 --> 01:07:06,522
The programme is tomorrow. We've to
go to the Governor's party today.

681
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:10,376
He is the one who had come
to India as a member of Australia.

682
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:10,974
Yes.

683
01:07:11,014 --> 01:07:13,068
I would like to take his interview.
Is it possible?

684
01:07:13,228 --> 01:07:18,052
It's tough but I'll try.
He doesn't like being interviewed.

685
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:22,025
Especially to the Indian journalist
Anyway you don't worry.

686
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:24,057
I'll talk to him.

687
01:07:24,261 --> 01:07:25,261
Great.

688
01:07:32,038 --> 01:07:36,106
- Good morning, Mr. Prem Arya.
- Good morning, sir.

689
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:38,825
How do you do?
Thank you for giving me an opportunity.

690
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:40,515
An Indian on time!

691
01:07:44,116 --> 01:07:47,097
Strange!
An Indian that too on time?!

692
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:50,826
Indians possess the strength
to move ahead of time.

693
01:07:50,912 --> 01:07:53,042
Very good.
Nice reply!

694
01:07:53,276 --> 01:07:55,596
- Are you comfortable?
- Absolutely sir. Thank you so much.

695
01:07:56,084 --> 01:07:58,765
- Go ahead. Ask your questions.
- Excuse me.

696
01:08:00,036 --> 01:08:01,638
For how many years
did you live in India?

697
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:02,832
8 years.

698
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,384
- How was the experience?
- Beautiful!

699
01:08:05,504 --> 01:08:07,310
Do you remember India?

700
01:08:07,818 --> 01:08:10,829
I can never forget India.

701
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:17,629
Then, why didn't you return to India
inspite of having a relation with it?

702
01:08:17,957 --> 01:08:21,451
Relation?
I didn't get you.

703
01:08:22,689 --> 01:08:28,018
You had married an Indian journalist.
You also have a daughter.

704
01:08:29,448 --> 01:08:33,937
Our readers are mostly Indian.
They'll like to know about your wife.

705
01:08:36,182 --> 01:08:39,023
This is very personal.
You can't ask me that.

706
01:08:40,193 --> 01:08:45,650
At least tell us why
didn't you get married again?

707
01:08:46,104 --> 01:08:51,712
No. And now I am beyond
the age of getting married.

708
01:08:57,578 --> 01:08:59,742
Papa. I know that you
do not want to be disturbed.

709
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:02,159
But there is an important call for
you from the British High Commission.

710
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:03,324
Ok darling.

711
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,992
- Hi.
- Excuse me, Mr. Prem.

712
01:09:05,046 --> 01:09:06,475
- Thank you very much.
- I will be back.

713
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:09,899
- Miss...
- Yes. - Excuse me. Please.

714
01:09:12,555 --> 01:09:15,177
I've toured the entire world.

715
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:18,655
Taken lots of snaps.

716
01:09:19,412 --> 01:09:22,538
But I've never seen a
perfect face like yours...

717
01:09:22,937 --> 01:09:25,493
Journalists speak
the truth very rarely.

718
01:09:25,734 --> 01:09:30,578
- I can also swear by my profession.
- Then I will believe you.

719
01:09:30,885 --> 01:09:32,294
I wish to take a snap of yours.

720
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,296
- No photographs, sorry.
- Please.

721
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:57,457
Give me the roll.

722
01:11:01,893 --> 01:11:04,567
Wow!
How did you get these snaps?

723
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:07,817
You gave the rolls to the
security officer in front of me.

724
01:11:08,257 --> 01:11:11,903
But the original rolls are with me.

725
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:15,558
Anyway, these are nice.

726
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:17,482
Especially this one.

727
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:21,363
O you like this!

728
01:11:22,097 --> 01:11:24,777
Alright... I'll get these
printed a else with your story.

729
01:11:24,897 --> 01:11:28,537
My story?
I didn't tell you my story.

730
01:11:29,096 --> 01:11:30,117
So, tell it.

731
01:11:30,174 --> 01:11:31,174
Why?

732
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:33,530
An interview.

733
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:36,432
My father will kill me.

734
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:40,339
After this story you will
surely become immortal.

735
01:11:40,624 --> 01:11:42,572
You'll surely be
immortal after this story.

736
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:46,284
You are right, sure.

737
01:12:56,124 --> 01:13:00,897
My heart is someone else's.

738
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,572
Maybe this is called love.

739
01:13:05,692 --> 01:13:09,845
Why am I so restless?

740
01:13:10,328 --> 01:13:14,927
Maybe this is called love.

741
01:13:14,981 --> 01:13:19,382
My heart is someone else's.

742
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:24,260
Maybe this is called love.

743
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:28,617
Why am I so restless?

744
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:33,667
Maybe this is called love.

745
01:13:33,787 --> 01:13:39,054
My heart is someone else's.

746
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:15,791
I was lost in one meeting.

747
01:14:16,049 --> 01:14:20,740
The affair increased in a short time.

748
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:25,138
I was lost in one meeting.

749
01:14:25,358 --> 01:14:29,814
The affair increased in a short time.

750
01:14:30,214 --> 01:14:34,774
I did not realize when our eyes met.

751
01:14:34,977 --> 01:14:39,337
Wonder what effect it has on my heart.

752
01:14:39,564 --> 01:14:43,892
My life has changed.

753
01:14:44,283 --> 01:14:48,930
Maybe this is called love.

754
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:53,394
My heart is someone else's.

755
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:58,242
My heart is someone else's.

756
01:14:58,362 --> 01:15:02,777
Maybe this is called love.

757
01:15:03,076 --> 01:15:07,457
My heart is someone else's.

758
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:12,283
Maybe this is called love.
My heart is someone else's.

759
01:15:12,403 --> 01:15:18,465
My heart is someone else's.

760
01:15:22,244 --> 01:15:23,793
Driver, let's go.

761
01:15:25,962 --> 01:15:29,096
I can't allow you to marry an Indian.

762
01:15:29,216 --> 01:15:32,057
Indians are deceivers,
liars and frauds.

763
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:38,030
I can't let you ruin your life. Never!

764
01:15:38,392 --> 01:15:42,495
Why do you hate Indians?
After all my mother was an Indian.

765
01:15:43,328 --> 01:15:46,642
If they are so bad, then,
why did you marry her?

766
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:49,076
I can't tell you that.

767
01:15:49,695 --> 01:15:54,737
But I want to know the secret
which you've kept hidden from me.

768
01:15:54,992 --> 01:15:58,851
I didn't tell you for
I wanted to see you happy.

769
01:15:59,228 --> 01:16:02,097
I wanted to bring you
up like a normal child.

770
01:16:02,217 --> 01:16:06,076
I didn't want to burden
you with all these things.

771
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:09,658
I'm no more a child.

772
01:16:09,977 --> 01:16:14,109
I should know what my
Indian mother's fault is.

773
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:19,548
All right.
I'll tell you everything.

774
01:16:20,703 --> 01:16:22,455
Then you can decide.

775
01:16:24,138 --> 01:16:28,657
I met your mother when
I was an ambassador for India.

776
01:16:29,601 --> 01:16:31,439
She was a journalist.

777
01:16:31,713 --> 01:16:33,188
She lived in Malaga.

778
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:36,968
We celebrated our
honeymoon in Malaga.

779
01:16:37,828 --> 01:16:39,721
Then, she came to Vienna with me.

780
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:45,177
But suddenly one day she
said she wanted to return to Malaga.

781
01:16:46,194 --> 01:16:49,617
She left a year old baby and me.

782
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:52,211
I... I called her up.
I had even written to her.

783
01:16:53,131 --> 01:16:55,377
But she never agreed to return.

784
01:16:57,243 --> 01:16:58,617
I may be a culprit.

785
01:16:59,225 --> 01:17:02,044
But a small child,
what was her fault?

786
01:17:02,905 --> 01:17:06,284
Why did she punish you?
I don't know.

787
01:17:07,715 --> 01:17:10,337
I've brought you up
since you were a child.

788
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,505
If I've no right
over you then it's alright.

789
01:17:12,736 --> 01:17:14,526
But I want to tell you something.

790
01:17:14,807 --> 01:17:19,977
When your mother left
me you were my hope to live.

791
01:17:21,006 --> 01:17:25,758
And now if you leave me
I'll have no reason to live.

792
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,737
I want to marry Sonia.

793
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:47,583
How dare you?
You... You Indian.

794
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:50,217
Sir your daughter loves this Indian.

795
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:55,257
I thought you were a decent man,
so I called you here.

796
01:17:55,734 --> 01:17:57,120
But you...

797
01:17:57,664 --> 01:17:59,184
My decency has been degraded only...

798
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,897
because I want
to marry your daughter.

799
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:05,558
No, no way that my daughter
will ever marry you. Yes!

800
01:18:05,816 --> 01:18:08,077
She will never marry you.

801
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:12,606
If you don't mind,
I'll like to hear it from Sonia.

802
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:19,217
Caroline, send Sonia in.

803
01:18:47,884 --> 01:18:55,166
I love you Prem but... but my father...
he needs me.

804
01:18:57,167 --> 01:19:00,964
My mom had left him.
She never returned.

805
01:19:02,783 --> 01:19:04,873
He has no one except me.

806
01:19:06,031 --> 01:19:08,196
Why didn't you think of it earlier?

807
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,499
What right do you
have to break my heart?

808
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:15,005
Give me a reply.

809
01:19:16,154 --> 01:19:18,033
Why did you come into my life?

810
01:19:18,605 --> 01:19:20,065
I was living well.

811
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:21,999
Why did you come into my life?

812
01:19:23,265 --> 01:19:25,257
Why?
Are you listening to me?

813
01:19:26,013 --> 01:19:27,555
Do you hear me?

814
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,506
Tony!

815
01:20:14,455 --> 01:20:16,655
I said, I will not have food.

816
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,296
Tony!

817
01:20:22,232 --> 01:20:23,416
Hi!

818
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:29,565
Ah! Ma'am, I thought
you must have already left.

819
01:20:29,808 --> 01:20:33,177
I was about to leave
but someone stopped me.

820
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:36,818
- I know who stopped you.
- Who?

821
01:20:36,858 --> 01:20:38,852
Your inner conscience stopped you.

822
01:20:39,103 --> 01:20:43,022
It told you, Stop!

823
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,864
Don't go...
whatever you'll find here,

824
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:52,956
you won't find anywhere. Right?

825
01:20:54,385 --> 01:20:59,510
Yes. Only once you can
love someone truly. So, don't lose it.

826
01:21:00,427 --> 01:21:03,098
Yes, Madam.
You are right! Congratulations, Tony!

827
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:06,003
Congratulations! Madam is not
leaving you and going anywhere.

828
01:21:06,043 --> 01:21:08,199
God has answered your prayers.

829
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:12,214
Tony, this article...

830
01:21:12,585 --> 01:21:16,531
I don't know. You see, even my photo
is printed in renowned newspaper.

831
01:21:18,965 --> 01:21:21,893
- Prem...
- He is Prem Arya, my close pal.

832
01:21:22,312 --> 01:21:23,666
Where does he live?

833
01:21:23,889 --> 01:21:25,849
He doesn't live here.
But he keeps on coming here.

834
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:28,139
But Madam, you must meet him once.
He is a wonderful man!

835
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,027
He writes excellent articles.
Tell him about your life...

836
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:31,468
Can you introduce me to him?

837
01:21:31,731 --> 01:21:36,027
Why not?
Think your job is done.

838
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,754
- Prem brother!
- Hey Tony!

839
01:21:44,795 --> 01:21:45,725
- Brother Prem!
- How are you?

840
01:21:45,765 --> 01:21:48,198
- Today I want to talk to you openly!
- Tony, what are you doing?

841
01:21:48,222 --> 01:21:49,547
What are you doing?

842
01:21:49,944 --> 01:21:50,729
Give me your hand.

843
01:21:50,769 --> 01:21:52,627
- Which one?
- Your right hand.

844
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:59,367
What a fortune! A man like Tony
will take birth and die unnoticed.

845
01:21:59,587 --> 01:22:01,813
But the day I saw this hand,
my luck has changed.

846
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:04,449
Whoever reads this article...
they go crazy!

847
01:22:04,789 --> 01:22:07,653
I wrote this article 8 months back.

848
01:22:07,693 --> 01:22:10,132
And you've already thanked me 16 times.
What's so important?

849
01:22:10,172 --> 01:22:14,697
It's a special day today.
Madam had come to my house today.

850
01:22:15,252 --> 01:22:16,082
Who?

851
01:22:16,178 --> 01:22:21,091
Madam! She's a beauty.
You won't find such a beauty anywhere.

852
01:22:21,784 --> 01:22:26,612
She came to my house
and read your article.

853
01:22:27,657 --> 01:22:31,396
I had hung your article on the wall.

854
01:22:31,804 --> 01:22:33,176
She liked the article.

855
01:22:33,296 --> 01:22:38,737
I told her I'll introduce her to the
person who wrote it. No big deal!

856
01:22:38,994 --> 01:22:40,538
What's her name?

857
01:22:42,232 --> 01:22:46,362
Strange!
I didn't ask her name.

858
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:48,945
No problem.
What's in a name?

859
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:51,425
A rose will always remain rose,
even if you change its name.

860
01:22:51,753 --> 01:22:58,113
Good! You are praising her so much.
It means you are in love. Isn't it?

861
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:05,806
I'm not of her standard.

862
01:23:06,072 --> 01:23:12,972
She is very rich I can
admire her but not possess her.

863
01:23:13,258 --> 01:23:15,561
Very well said.
Very well said.

864
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:18,033
Come to the restaurant.

865
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:23,237
She was praising you so much that
I told her I'll introduce you to her.

866
01:23:23,762 --> 01:23:26,262
Please meet her.
I'll be honoured.

867
01:23:27,029 --> 01:23:28,553
- For my sake.
- Okay, okay.

868
01:23:28,673 --> 01:23:30,035
Today at 4.30 p.m.

869
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,846
Hey Tony, one minute.

870
01:23:36,886 --> 01:23:39,098
Speak up Ma'am. Good things
shouldn't be kept to heart.

871
01:23:39,138 --> 01:23:40,019
Or else, it's not good.

872
01:23:40,139 --> 01:23:41,642
Here...

873
01:23:42,686 --> 01:23:44,632
- What's this?
- Keep it.

874
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:47,565
No, I won't accept fees from you.

875
01:23:48,075 --> 01:23:51,942
One earns for living,
but sometimes I do listen to my heart.

876
01:23:52,022 --> 01:23:53,640
But this is not the fees.

877
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:55,158
Then, what is it?

878
01:23:55,582 --> 01:23:57,347
You pay the hotel bill.

879
01:23:57,547 --> 01:24:00,564
- Come on.
- Okay, cool. I got it.

880
01:24:01,377 --> 01:24:04,097
A lady should not pay when
accompanied by a man. Right?

881
01:24:05,348 --> 01:24:07,620
- Okay, let's move.
- Let's go.

882
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:32,313
- Hey Tony!
- Hi, Prem! Hi!

883
01:24:32,433 --> 01:24:35,603
- Happening, man!
- You are happening.

884
01:24:49,037 --> 01:24:50,948
Mr. Prem, stunned aren't you?

885
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,629
You wouldn't have
expected to meet such a person.

886
01:24:53,684 --> 01:24:55,963
My Madam is beautiful, isn't she?

887
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:59,920
Madam, this is Mr. Prem
and Mr. Prem this is Madam.

888
01:25:04,276 --> 01:25:06,723
- Hi Prem.
- How are you Sonia?

889
01:25:09,045 --> 01:25:10,045
Alive.

890
01:25:10,084 --> 01:25:14,123
How do you know her?

891
01:25:17,049 --> 01:25:19,152
A journallst coming
from Vienna had told me.

892
01:25:23,925 --> 01:25:25,988
Excuse me, I'll place the order.

893
01:25:26,811 --> 01:25:28,818
His suit is giving me a complex.

894
01:25:30,809 --> 01:25:32,243
How did you land here?

895
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:35,015
Perhaps to meet you.

896
01:25:36,551 --> 01:25:38,061
You have come alone.

897
01:25:39,394 --> 01:25:42,803
Nanny is with me.
Papa's not here.

898
01:25:50,094 --> 01:25:52,226
I've not married as yet.

899
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:55,283
I didn't ask you that.

900
01:25:56,642 --> 01:25:59,251
You were watching my hands.
I thought, you were looking...

901
01:25:59,371 --> 01:26:01,123
out for the wedding ring.

902
01:26:04,763 --> 01:26:06,079
How are you?

903
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:09,093
Fine and happy too.

904
01:26:10,288 --> 01:26:11,563
Are you angry?

905
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:14,363
Not at all.

906
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:21,812
We couldn't get married,
but at least we can be friends.

907
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:25,322
We were and will remain friends.

908
01:26:27,893 --> 01:26:31,585
You know my helplessness.

909
01:26:32,017 --> 01:26:35,579
I have not changed. I still love you.

910
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:41,483
Now this is of no use.

911
01:26:42,418 --> 01:26:45,114
Prem please try to understand.

912
01:26:46,896 --> 01:26:47,963
Please.

913
01:26:57,241 --> 01:27:01,163
I've placed the order.
Where's Mr. Prem?

914
01:27:02,438 --> 01:27:04,595
He has left. We will also leave.

915
01:27:04,826 --> 01:27:05,826
Leave?

916
01:27:09,703 --> 01:27:13,073
Hey Joe!
Forget it.

917
01:27:15,975 --> 01:27:17,478
Wonder what happened?

918
01:27:17,598 --> 01:27:21,883
The meeting got over in one minute.
Madam forgot her money with me.

919
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:28,894
God always gives me a
chance to come across her.

920
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:45,803
What is the matter?

921
01:27:46,566 --> 01:27:49,090
- You went to meet Prem?
- Yes.

922
01:27:51,492 --> 01:27:53,919
- You shouldn't have gone.
- Nanny.

923
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:58,460
I realized it after meeting
him that I love him very much.

924
01:27:59,995 --> 01:28:03,003
I can't live without him. Never!

925
01:28:03,348 --> 01:28:04,754
Forget him.

926
01:28:04,967 --> 01:28:08,907
How? I can't forget him.

927
01:28:09,615 --> 01:28:12,723
You deserve a better guy than him.

928
01:28:13,101 --> 01:28:14,603
What is she talking?

929
01:28:14,796 --> 01:28:16,949
Marry someone of your status.

930
01:28:16,999 --> 01:28:21,668
Status! He's poor, that's his crime?
I love him.

931
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:27,016
He gave me the happiness which
even my father couldn't give me.

932
01:28:31,082 --> 01:28:35,266
- Whatever it is, I love him.
- I too love you a lot.

933
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,243
Think about it, Sonia.
I heard it, it's okay.

934
01:28:40,869 --> 01:28:43,533
But what if anyone else would've
heard it? There would be a problem.

935
01:28:43,557 --> 01:28:45,003
Now nothing can stop me.

936
01:28:45,213 --> 01:28:47,895
I'll love him till my last breath.

937
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:52,396
And I'll only love you!

938
01:30:08,955 --> 01:30:12,187
If you say, I'll kiss you...

939
01:30:12,307 --> 01:30:15,043
in this lovely weather.

940
01:30:15,816 --> 01:30:18,803
If you say, I'll kiss you...

941
01:30:19,183 --> 01:30:22,034
in this lovely weather.

942
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:26,114
The heart says...

943
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:29,554
my beloved...

944
01:30:30,196 --> 01:30:34,503
I should cross all limits in love.

945
01:30:34,755 --> 01:30:37,809
If you say, I'll go round...

946
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:41,529
in your passion.

947
01:30:41,596 --> 01:30:48,089
If you say,
I'll go round in your passion.

948
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:51,869
The heart says...

949
01:30:52,119 --> 01:31:00,119
my beloved,
I should cross all limits in love.

950
01:31:00,526 --> 01:31:06,763
If you say, I'll kiss
you in this lovely weather.

951
01:31:07,331 --> 01:31:14,762
If you say,
I'll go round in your passion.

952
01:31:32,503 --> 01:31:39,349
From your tresses,
I'll steal your fragrance.

953
01:31:39,389 --> 01:31:46,203
I'll steal the loveliness
from your lips.

954
01:31:46,323 --> 01:31:54,323
- Stop it, I am feeling shy.
- Why do you feel shy?

955
01:31:55,513 --> 01:32:03,513
Why do you fear?
Nothing is in our control.

956
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:10,773
If you say, I'll go
round in your passion.

957
01:32:10,959 --> 01:32:17,797
If you say, I'll kiss you in
this lovely weather.

958
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:51,323
My eyes keep
watching you all the time.

959
01:32:51,553 --> 01:32:58,249
These fair arms just wish for you.

960
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:04,323
I cannot live being
separated from you.

961
01:33:04,458 --> 01:33:07,617
In these eyes...

962
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:11,460
I have dreams...

963
01:33:11,722 --> 01:33:16,032
and I am waiting for you.

964
01:33:16,278 --> 01:33:22,430
If you say, I'll kiss
you in this lovely weather.

965
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:29,578
If you say, I'll kiss
you in this lovely weather.

966
01:33:30,228 --> 01:33:33,424
The heart says...

967
01:33:33,663 --> 01:33:41,663
my beloved,
I should cross all limits in love.

968
01:33:42,076 --> 01:33:48,494
If you say, I'll kiss
you in this lovely weather.

969
01:33:48,853 --> 01:33:56,425
If you say, I'll go
round in your passion.

970
01:34:32,939 --> 01:34:34,798
- Hello.
- Hi Prem!

971
01:34:35,664 --> 01:34:36,664
Sonia!

972
01:34:38,705 --> 01:34:40,306
How did you get this number?

973
01:34:41,341 --> 01:34:42,370
From Tony.

974
01:34:42,645 --> 01:34:48,446
Good you called me up. I was
thinking about you the whole night.

975
01:34:50,529 --> 01:34:55,062
I was sorry for yesterday's behaviour.

976
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:58,029
I should not have said that.

977
01:34:59,728 --> 01:35:04,306
Whatever you said was right.

978
01:35:05,278 --> 01:35:07,645
I've no right to step
into your life again.

979
01:35:08,518 --> 01:35:09,534
My life?

980
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:12,714
My life doesn't remain mine anymore.

981
01:35:14,205 --> 01:35:17,946
I never imagined, our attempt in
order to make Papa happy...

982
01:35:18,214 --> 01:35:20,182
would drift us far apart.

983
01:35:23,255 --> 01:35:24,255
Prem.

984
01:35:26,494 --> 01:35:27,751
I'm leaving tomorrow.

985
01:35:28,161 --> 01:35:29,376
Don't go, Sonia.

986
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:32,175
- Prem, I...
- Please.

987
01:35:32,946 --> 01:35:35,862
But till now...

988
01:35:36,369 --> 01:35:38,917
Until it's possible, please.

989
01:35:40,019 --> 01:35:45,066
- Ok. I love you Sonia...
- Me too Prem.

990
01:35:50,539 --> 01:35:54,341
- So we will have to unpack?
- Yes.

991
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:01,586
If you get the time then think about
it that if your father comes to know...

992
01:36:02,379 --> 01:36:03,797
What he will think.

993
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:25,686
This is the limit, Madam!
You went without informing me.

994
01:36:26,061 --> 01:36:27,785
I'm waiting for you since morning.

995
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:29,528
I wasted 8 liters petrol for you.

996
01:36:30,097 --> 01:36:32,114
I was about to go
to the police station.

997
01:36:33,415 --> 01:36:35,235
You should've left
a message at the desk.

998
01:36:36,895 --> 01:36:38,428
I was so worried, you know.

999
01:36:38,829 --> 01:36:40,944
I'm sorry.

1000
01:36:41,532 --> 01:36:46,121
Now don't embarrass me.
I've no right to talk to you like this.

1001
01:36:47,585 --> 01:36:50,956
You are so beautiful. You can even
turn a gentleman into a rogue.

1002
01:36:52,257 --> 01:36:56,360
I'll do everything with your
permission in future. Okay?

1003
01:36:56,741 --> 01:36:59,531
Tomorrow I've to go to
Paradise island. Prem has called me.

1004
01:36:59,595 --> 01:37:00,886
You can go.

1005
01:37:01,326 --> 01:37:04,463
- Won't you come?
- If you wish, I'll come.

1006
01:37:04,842 --> 01:37:07,286
All right, tomorrow we'll go.

1007
01:37:07,326 --> 01:37:09,806
Come, I'll drop you.

1008
01:37:10,371 --> 01:37:12,566
You don't like my like?

1009
01:37:14,985 --> 01:37:21,643
Good I found you. I've bought a dress.
How do I look?

1010
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:31,674
- How much did it cost?
- Nine hundred rupees. Why?

1011
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,146
It's too much. Seems to be new.

1012
01:37:35,213 --> 01:37:36,953
No jokes. Tony,
tell me, how do I look?

1013
01:37:36,996 --> 01:37:41,083
- I told you, the dress seems to be new.
- It's new. Listen...

1014
01:37:41,408 --> 01:37:44,675
I'll wear this for the party in
Paradise island. We'll go together.

1015
01:37:44,849 --> 01:37:49,736
- I can't go with you there.
- Why?

1016
01:37:49,856 --> 01:37:52,827
Because I'll have to take my
tourist around. Work, you see, baby.

1017
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:55,824
Tourists?
Or that Madam.

1018
01:37:56,652 --> 01:37:57,809
She is also one of my tourist.

1019
01:37:57,833 --> 01:38:03,585
Look Neena, Madam is my
work and my work is my worship.

1020
01:38:09,329 --> 01:38:11,446
- Hi Tony.
- Hi buddy how are you?

1021
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:15,045
- Hey! How are you? - Hi - Hi.
- Hello. - It's okay, see you bye.

1022
01:38:15,085 --> 01:38:18,019
How are you Mr. Gonzalves?

1023
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:20,540
- How are you doing? - I am fine.
- He is a big shot. Big shot.

1024
01:38:20,564 --> 01:38:23,876
Hi Rodriquez.
He is the commissioner. See...

1025
01:38:24,193 --> 01:38:25,410
This is Prem.

1026
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,554
What are you doing here?

1027
01:38:26,618 --> 01:38:28,842
- Tony boy, how are you?
- How are you doing?

1028
01:38:28,882 --> 01:38:30,564
You are looking handsome.
Very handsome.

1029
01:38:30,611 --> 01:38:31,988
What are you doing here?

1030
01:38:32,028 --> 01:38:35,317
Tony, mind your language
or else you'll repent.

1031
01:38:35,357 --> 01:38:37,738
- You are the worst person here.
- Move on!

1032
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:40,083
- Take it easy. Relax.
- What man, this is very bad.

1033
01:38:40,134 --> 01:38:42,533
- Neena, this is Sonia. Neena.
- Hi Neena.

1034
01:38:42,653 --> 01:38:44,864
- Hello.
- You always insult me during parties.

1035
01:38:45,045 --> 01:38:46,129
Let's dance, please.

1036
01:38:46,174 --> 01:38:47,767
Silly girl!
Who the hell will dance with you?

1037
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:48,853
Who will get insulted in the party?

1038
01:38:48,877 --> 01:38:49,900
You always raise your
hands at the wrong place!

1039
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,472
Tony please do it.

1040
01:38:51,512 --> 01:38:56,838
You! Oh you!
I can dance at your finger tips.

1041
01:38:57,081 --> 01:38:58,601
I will come in one minute.

1042
01:38:58,801 --> 01:39:01,869
As it is I've to dance at
your finger tips for the whole life.

1043
01:39:17,434 --> 01:39:24,756
Haiya Ho!
Haiya Ho!

1044
01:39:26,230 --> 01:39:29,939
Haiya Ho!

1045
01:39:30,614 --> 01:39:34,462
Haiya Ho!

1046
01:39:34,971 --> 01:39:39,107
Haiya Ho!
What fun! What magic!

1047
01:39:39,287 --> 01:39:43,695
Me and you!
What fun! What magic!

1048
01:39:43,735 --> 01:39:48,066
Such meetings don't
happen everyday, my love.

1049
01:39:48,124 --> 01:39:52,507
Let's talk about
our love with our eyes.

1050
01:39:52,547 --> 01:39:56,574
Haiya Ho!
What fun! What magic!

1051
01:39:56,793 --> 01:40:01,174
Me and you!
What fun! What magic!

1052
01:40:01,294 --> 01:40:05,599
Such meetings don't
happen everyday, my love.

1053
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:10,052
Let's talk about
our love with our eyes.

1054
01:40:10,092 --> 01:40:16,296
Haiya Ho! What fun!
What magic! What magic!

1055
01:40:40,782 --> 01:40:45,040
Your eyes are amazing!

1056
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:49,480
Your blue eyes are beautiful!

1057
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,829
A face like yours is
not to be seen here.

1058
01:40:53,914 --> 01:40:57,633
Such beautiful hair is
not to be seen here.

1059
01:40:57,753 --> 01:41:05,753
You are fanatical! Alone!
There is no one like anywhere.

1060
01:41:06,537 --> 01:41:11,170
Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic!

1061
01:41:11,356 --> 01:41:15,767
Me and you! What fun! What magic!

1062
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:20,184
Such meetings don't
happen everyday, my love.

1063
01:41:20,224 --> 01:41:24,611
Let's talk about our
love with our eyes.

1064
01:41:24,651 --> 01:41:29,035
Haiya Ho! What fun!
What magic! What magic!

1065
01:41:50,926 --> 01:41:55,288
What is my story! Listen!

1066
01:41:55,358 --> 01:41:59,416
I am heart broken! Listen!

1067
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:03,982
Whom should I tell this thing to?

1068
01:42:04,102 --> 01:42:07,763
Whom should I show my pain to?

1069
01:42:07,934 --> 01:42:15,934
These wounds those moments,
we will never think of them again.

1070
01:42:16,586 --> 01:42:24,586
Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic!
Me and you! What fun! What magic!

1071
01:42:25,918 --> 01:42:30,316
Such meetings don't
happen everyday, my love.

1072
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:34,496
Let's talk about our
love with our eyes.

1073
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:39,844
Haiya Ho! What fun!
What magic! What magic!

1074
01:42:47,987 --> 01:42:52,017
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1075
01:42:52,354 --> 01:42:56,573
Ho! Ho! Ho!

1076
01:42:56,737 --> 01:43:00,440
I am crazy about you, my beloved.

1077
01:43:01,137 --> 01:43:04,805
You are my story, my beloved.

1078
01:43:05,507 --> 01:43:09,581
I have always
thought about you, I swear.

1079
01:43:09,874 --> 01:43:13,685
I have always loved you, I swear.

1080
01:43:13,725 --> 01:43:17,935
In my heart,
there is aspiration only for you.

1081
01:43:17,975 --> 01:43:22,834
There is no one like you anywhere.

1082
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:27,009
Haiya Ho! What fun! What magic!

1083
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:31,666
Me and you! What fun! What magic!

1084
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:35,891
Such meetings don't
happen everyday, my love.

1085
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:40,472
Let's talk about our
love with our eyes.

1086
01:43:40,592 --> 01:43:44,663
- Haiya Ho!
- What fun! What magic! What magic!

1087
01:43:44,865 --> 01:43:49,085
- Me and you!
- What fun! What magic!

1088
01:43:49,582 --> 01:43:50,786
What are you doing?

1089
01:43:50,826 --> 01:43:54,209
What are you doing?
Listen.

1090
01:43:54,329 --> 01:43:56,292
How wonderful you look!

1091
01:43:56,646 --> 01:44:00,008
I'm serious.
I'll write an article on Neena.

1092
01:44:00,315 --> 01:44:02,878
Sonia, you know...
she's an amazing girl.

1093
01:44:03,066 --> 01:44:07,003
She is self reliant at such
a small age. She manages all alone.

1094
01:44:07,202 --> 01:44:11,704
- Isn't it wonderful?
- As it is she's crazy.

1095
01:44:12,234 --> 01:44:14,138
God knows what'll happen
after her article is published.

1096
01:44:14,162 --> 01:44:16,844
- Tony! - Here she starts!
- Here we go again.

1097
01:44:16,964 --> 01:44:18,009
Start.

1098
01:44:18,592 --> 01:44:23,392
Those who don't have anyone's
support have to be self-reliant.

1099
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:27,872
Don't you have anyone?
Parents, brothers, sisters?

1100
01:44:28,985 --> 01:44:36,920
Tony is my neighbour and
my friend too. And... and...

1101
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:42,626
He's my only childhood friend.
He's my support.

1102
01:44:42,873 --> 01:44:46,552
What else could I do, Madam?
I too am an orphan like her.

1103
01:44:47,162 --> 01:44:48,672
So I can understand her grief.

1104
01:44:49,471 --> 01:44:54,312
I had seen a play when I was a kid.
It's dialogues touched my heart.

1105
01:44:55,557 --> 01:44:58,032
Loneliness supports loneliness.

1106
01:45:01,152 --> 01:45:03,877
We kept on supporting each
other and have come a else way.

1107
01:45:04,027 --> 01:45:05,632
Now let's see where destiny takes us.

1108
01:45:06,464 --> 01:45:08,430
I am very impressed, seriously.

1109
01:45:08,513 --> 01:45:10,445
But nowadays I'm tensed.

1110
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:11,599
Why?

1111
01:45:11,641 --> 01:45:14,578
She is young and
above all she is beautiful.

1112
01:45:14,780 --> 01:45:18,637
I'm thinking of
getting her married off.

1113
01:45:28,794 --> 01:45:30,533
Did you see brother Prem?
Did you see?

1114
01:45:31,752 --> 01:45:34,262
I can understand the
whole world but not her.

1115
01:45:34,302 --> 01:45:36,361
Just a minute, I'll be back.

1116
01:45:36,446 --> 01:45:39,258
Hey you basket of flower!

1117
01:45:39,618 --> 01:45:42,312
Hey my beauty! My fenny!

1118
01:45:48,181 --> 01:45:50,114
Did you notice something?

1119
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:57,374
Yes, I did. The girl loves
him and the guy does not understand.

1120
01:45:59,491 --> 01:46:01,531
Why does it happen?

1121
01:46:01,651 --> 01:46:05,152
Why is there a
problem in every love story?

1122
01:46:06,593 --> 01:46:11,584
Perhaps God is testing us.
Whether the love is true or not.

1123
01:46:14,516 --> 01:46:16,934
What about those who pass the test?

1124
01:46:20,743 --> 01:46:22,312
They unite.

1125
01:46:27,076 --> 01:46:30,955
- But Madam...
- We enjoyed, didn't we?

1126
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,031
- Of course Ma'am.
- Thank you Tony.

1127
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:38,954
I feel proud of myself today.
No doubt, I am a guide.

1128
01:46:38,994 --> 01:46:45,232
I never got to see so much till today.
I'm sorry. I'll leave.

1129
01:46:45,557 --> 01:46:46,872
- What is it?
- I want to say something.

1130
01:46:46,896 --> 01:46:47,896
Go on.

1131
01:46:48,771 --> 01:46:51,227
Now what will she
say in this closed room?!

1132
01:46:56,807 --> 01:47:00,819
Sit.

1133
01:47:00,939 --> 01:47:03,061
My chair will get wet!

1134
01:47:03,615 --> 01:47:05,718
No problem, I'll sit.

1135
01:47:33,682 --> 01:47:38,106
Have you ever been in love?

1136
01:47:51,072 --> 01:47:54,277
My friends have been.

1137
01:47:56,508 --> 01:48:01,908
But now it seems, it's my turn.

1138
01:48:02,112 --> 01:48:09,752
I know. Do you know,
how one feels when in love?

1139
01:48:11,107 --> 01:48:14,232
Yes, I know, I'm getting it...

1140
01:48:16,841 --> 01:48:24,182
How will you come
to know that a girl is in love?

1141
01:48:26,408 --> 01:48:27,620
I'll come to know.

1142
01:48:29,512 --> 01:48:34,209
Then, go ahead, find out.

1143
01:48:36,758 --> 01:48:38,944
A girl... in love.

1144
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:48,818
I'll keep it as a secret.

1145
01:48:49,299 --> 01:48:51,443
But tell the girl at least.

1146
01:48:51,885 --> 01:48:53,260
What?

1147
01:48:53,466 --> 01:48:55,111
I love you.

1148
01:48:59,845 --> 01:49:02,058
- Shall I?
- Yes

1149
01:49:07,299 --> 01:49:12,495
- Sure! Shall I tell her?
- Go on... - I'm feeling shy.

1150
01:49:12,911 --> 01:49:16,481
It's very simple, Tony. I love you.

1151
01:49:25,243 --> 01:49:27,789
The thing is
I have never said it to anyone.

1152
01:49:29,535 --> 01:49:31,393
I will say it.

1153
01:49:33,928 --> 01:49:35,532
I...

1154
01:49:39,794 --> 01:49:44,991
love... you.

1155
01:49:45,042 --> 01:49:48,654
Yes! Yes, Tony!
That's it!

1156
01:49:54,663 --> 01:49:56,226
You've said it.

1157
01:49:57,410 --> 01:49:59,168
- Madam?
- Yes.

1158
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:04,521
Shall I leave?

1159
01:50:06,434 --> 01:50:07,974
Good night, Tony.

1160
01:50:09,651 --> 01:50:11,066
Goodnight.

1161
01:50:13,001 --> 01:50:14,451
Goodnight.

1162
01:50:18,033 --> 01:50:22,579
- Bye, bye.
- Goodnight.

1163
01:51:01,528 --> 01:51:07,727
If you say,
I'll kiss you in this lovely weather.

1164
01:51:08,414 --> 01:51:11,455
If you say...

1165
01:51:11,762 --> 01:51:15,224
I'll kiss you in
this lovely weather.

1166
01:51:15,489 --> 01:51:18,790
The heart says...

1167
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:21,874
my beloved...

1168
01:51:22,777 --> 01:51:27,509
I should cross all limits in love.

1169
01:51:36,513 --> 01:51:38,520
A glass for him, this is mine.

1170
01:51:41,448 --> 01:51:44,151
- Hey! Neena!
- Tony!

1171
01:51:46,097 --> 01:51:51,155
You are enjoying all alone.
There is a candle, and a castle.

1172
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:56,674
For whom is the other glass?

1173
01:51:56,943 --> 01:51:58,792
For the one whom I love!

1174
01:51:59,095 --> 01:52:00,751
Who is that unfortunate guy?

1175
01:52:00,791 --> 01:52:03,219
Hey, mind you!
Don't you bad-mouth him.

1176
01:52:03,264 --> 01:52:05,345
- Are you serious?
- Of course, yes.

1177
01:52:05,675 --> 01:52:08,039
- You love him very much?
- Yes, a lot.

1178
01:52:08,919 --> 01:52:10,542
Did you tell him, I love you

1179
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:16,464
You should express your
love from the very start.

1180
01:52:16,633 --> 01:52:22,072
Whenever you propose someone
for the first time in life...

1181
01:52:22,328 --> 01:52:27,543
you know you feel as if you've
consumed a bottle of sweet wine...

1182
01:52:28,646 --> 01:52:31,924
which also gives you a high.

1183
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:35,808
Yes, it does happen in love.

1184
01:52:37,638 --> 01:52:41,163
I just can't believe!
The way she said, I love you

1185
01:52:42,952 --> 01:52:45,050
- She?
- Who?

1186
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:47,611
Madam, who else?

1187
01:52:50,365 --> 01:52:52,822
I was thinking that only I loved her.

1188
01:52:52,894 --> 01:52:57,041
But today I realised
that she also loves me.

1189
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:08,410
Yes Tony, this fire is
such that it burns everything.

1190
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:14,592
Some express it
whereas some are just helpless.

1191
01:53:15,594 --> 01:53:17,242
You are quite intelligent!

1192
01:53:17,362 --> 01:53:21,638
Come on cheers!
Cheers to Sonia! Hey! Have it!

1193
01:53:22,528 --> 01:53:24,308
Why don't you have it?

1194
01:53:25,927 --> 01:53:30,774
Actually my companion
is drifting away from me.

1195
01:53:31,385 --> 01:53:33,661
Is he? No problem.
He'll be on the track again.

1196
01:53:33,842 --> 01:53:35,136
If your love is true,

1197
01:53:35,198 --> 01:53:36,902
may be after some time
but he will be yours.

1198
01:53:36,926 --> 01:53:39,121
Come on cheers!
Cheers for Sonia!

1199
01:53:42,963 --> 01:53:46,307
Come on. Come on,
cheers for your love, man!

1200
01:53:49,950 --> 01:53:50,950
Have it.

1201
01:54:00,943 --> 01:54:02,065
Hello.

1202
01:54:02,185 --> 01:54:05,935
Sonia, what are you doing?

1203
01:54:06,747 --> 01:54:08,712
I'm thinking, what I should do.

1204
01:54:09,234 --> 01:54:10,329
Shall I help you?

1205
01:54:10,950 --> 01:54:12,032
Please.

1206
01:54:12,689 --> 01:54:14,804
Spend your day with someone
who spends sleepless nights...

1207
01:54:14,828 --> 01:54:16,685
thinking about you.

1208
01:54:17,218 --> 01:54:20,496
Good idea!
But where do I find such a person.

1209
01:54:20,722 --> 01:54:22,224
I know him.

1210
01:54:22,495 --> 01:54:24,820
Really?
What's his name?

1211
01:54:26,802 --> 01:54:27,843
Prem.

1212
01:54:31,002 --> 01:54:34,368
Wait for me on the beach.
I'll be coming.

1213
01:54:35,495 --> 01:54:36,505
Bye.

1214
01:54:38,472 --> 01:54:40,073
Yahoo, Sonia!

1215
01:54:42,892 --> 01:54:43,992
Papa, you!

1216
01:54:44,112 --> 01:54:47,512
Yes, my baby!
Are you not happy to see me?

1217
01:54:47,632 --> 01:54:50,513
No papa.
I am very happy.

1218
01:54:52,409 --> 01:54:54,621
But all of a sudden...

1219
01:54:55,856 --> 01:54:56,983
What a pleasant surprise!

1220
01:54:57,023 --> 01:55:01,880
My darling girl!
I was missing you. So I came here.

1221
01:55:02,108 --> 01:55:03,480
That's why I am here.

1222
01:55:03,525 --> 01:55:06,237
How do you like Malaga?
How do you like India?

1223
01:55:06,446 --> 01:55:12,334
Nice! The weather, the people...
just wonderfully warm.

1224
01:55:12,454 --> 01:55:16,118
Now I'm here for your company.
You will not be alone.

1225
01:55:16,465 --> 01:55:18,605
We will do everything together.

1226
01:55:27,728 --> 01:55:28,922
I will give her a flower.

1227
01:55:29,145 --> 01:55:32,282
I'll give madam a flower. In exchange
of that she will give me a kiss.

1228
01:55:32,373 --> 01:55:34,213
And in exchange of
that I will give her a kiss.

1229
01:55:35,896 --> 01:55:37,158
I think she is having a bath.

1230
01:55:37,676 --> 01:55:41,622
- Yes. - Yes.
- What can I do for you?

1231
01:55:41,893 --> 01:55:44,106
One masala tea,
and 4 biscuits please.

1232
01:55:44,301 --> 01:55:45,913
No! No!

1233
01:55:46,033 --> 01:55:48,881
- Who are you and why you are here?
- Why you are here?

1234
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:51,912
- Who are you?
- I am me.

1235
01:55:52,326 --> 01:55:53,643
What the hell are you doing here?

1236
01:55:53,667 --> 01:55:54,747
Hell means hell?

1237
01:55:54,914 --> 01:55:56,745
He says he will hit me.

1238
01:55:56,909 --> 01:55:58,067
Who let you in here?

1239
01:55:58,146 --> 01:55:59,644
Have you gone crazy?

1240
01:55:59,847 --> 01:56:02,117
- What?
- Hey you fool! This is too much!

1241
01:56:02,237 --> 01:56:05,839
- What is this?
- Hey you are going on talking because I am listening.

1242
01:56:06,342 --> 01:56:08,489
Idiot!
Get out of here!

1243
01:56:08,661 --> 01:56:11,469
- Quiet! Quiet!
- What are you saying?

1244
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:16,872
- Hey you...
- No! I understand nothing.

1245
01:56:17,306 --> 01:56:18,792
Are you mad?

1246
01:56:19,392 --> 01:56:23,345
You get out of here.
I'll call the security guards now.

1247
01:56:23,465 --> 01:56:26,355
No one dare call
Tony idiot here in Goa.

1248
01:56:26,395 --> 01:56:28,124
You idiot!
I don't care.

1249
01:56:28,178 --> 01:56:31,136
You get out of here or
I will call the security guards.

1250
01:56:31,256 --> 01:56:34,662
Security guard! I'll give him
a tenner and he'll disappear.

1251
01:56:35,863 --> 01:56:36,969
So you don't know, who am I.

1252
01:56:36,993 --> 01:56:39,513
- Who are you?
- I'm Ambassador of Austria.

1253
01:56:39,557 --> 01:56:41,302
I'm the Mercedes of India.

1254
01:56:41,452 --> 01:56:43,940
- Mercedes of India.
- Yes. - You idiot.

1255
01:56:44,105 --> 01:56:46,747
You get out of here.
You stupid, idiot.

1256
01:56:46,867 --> 01:56:49,728
I'm not abusing you
for you are elder to me.

1257
01:56:49,777 --> 01:56:51,373
You are exceeding your limits.

1258
01:56:51,413 --> 01:56:52,885
Then, what is this?

1259
01:56:53,149 --> 01:56:54,869
Don't you know,
this is a piece of cucumber.

1260
01:56:54,968 --> 01:56:57,051
- Then what you want?
- What you want?

1261
01:56:57,228 --> 01:57:00,692
- I want you to get out of here?
- I want you to get out from there.

1262
01:57:00,812 --> 01:57:02,918
- Where?
- You go out from khidki What is a khidki?

1263
01:57:03,771 --> 01:57:05,291
Khidki means window.

1264
01:57:05,346 --> 01:57:06,501
Stupid man!

1265
01:57:06,541 --> 01:57:07,947
Because you are elder
you keep saying all this?

1266
01:57:07,971 --> 01:57:09,759
- Yes, so what?
- Now I'll catch you.

1267
01:57:09,879 --> 01:57:11,273
- What will you do?
- Surely, I'll catch you.

1268
01:57:11,297 --> 01:57:12,672
- Yes.
- And after that?

1269
01:57:12,903 --> 01:57:17,192
- I'll catch your nose.
- Don't touch me! - Why?

1270
01:57:17,312 --> 01:57:20,236
No body can touch Tony Gonsalves.
He is too much man.

1271
01:57:20,276 --> 01:57:24,568
- I can also touch you.
- So, what's great?

1272
01:57:24,688 --> 01:57:26,740
What is that?
I want you to get out now.

01:57:26,780 --> 01:57:29,981
- Even I want you to get out now.
- Where? - Out.

01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:32,291
- This is my place.
- This is my place.

1275
01:57:32,411 --> 01:57:35,095
- What are you going to do?
- So what are you going to do?

1276
01:57:35,143 --> 01:57:38,307
I am going to touch you.
Touch you, like this.

1277
01:57:38,587 --> 01:57:40,995
Even I can touch you.
Touch you.

1278
01:57:41,035 --> 01:57:45,163
You are an Indian!
You are not only an idiot but a swine.

1279
01:57:45,738 --> 01:57:47,872
- I am not a swine.
- I want you to be out of here.

1280
01:57:49,149 --> 01:57:51,050
- Tony...
- Yes. I want you out of here.

1281
01:57:51,099 --> 01:57:52,945
It's between two men.
Ladies should not interfere.

1282
01:57:52,969 --> 01:57:53,789
Go and have a bath in the bathroom.

1283
01:57:53,829 --> 01:57:55,880
- But Tony. - No.
- Tony.

1284
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:57,304
- Papa.
- Papa.

1285
01:57:58,403 --> 01:57:59,403
Papa!

1286
01:58:00,108 --> 01:58:08,108
- Papa, Tony.
- Yes. Papa. Sonia's papa.

1287
01:58:09,545 --> 01:58:12,160
- Papa. - Papa. - Tony. - Tony.

1288
01:58:12,280 --> 01:58:13,690
- He escorts me in Goa.
- Escorts in Goa.

1289
01:58:13,714 --> 01:58:16,097
- He is always so happy.
- I am always so happy.

1290
01:58:16,217 --> 01:58:17,767
- He is a gentleman.
- I am a gentleman, papa.

1291
01:58:17,791 --> 01:58:19,493
- Papa. Forgive me.
- Security! Get him out from here.

1292
01:58:19,517 --> 01:58:20,882
Papa, he is apologizing.

1293
01:58:21,447 --> 01:58:23,666
- Forgive me, papa. - He is sorry.
- You are mad. - Sorry.

1294
01:58:23,690 --> 01:58:26,561
But he is very sweet you know.
Papa, I am your Tony!

1295
01:58:26,619 --> 01:58:29,257
- Sonia, get him out of here.
- Papa, I love you.

1296
01:58:29,297 --> 01:58:30,846
Please papa, I'll handle him.

1297
01:58:30,886 --> 01:58:34,710
- Security! - I'll handle him.
- No! I don't like him.

1298
01:58:34,753 --> 01:58:36,952
Papa, don't worry,
I'll ask him to leave.

1299
01:58:37,072 --> 01:58:40,061
- Tony!
- Idiot! Get out!

1300
01:58:40,104 --> 01:58:45,577
- Papa! Papa!
- Papa! Get the hell out of here!

1301
01:58:57,203 --> 01:58:59,931
- Ya...
- May I speak to Sonia please?

1302
01:59:00,364 --> 01:59:03,299
- Who is calling?
- Prem. - Prem.

1303
01:59:13,032 --> 01:59:17,373
So that's why you are here in India.
I see... Prem

1304
01:59:17,539 --> 01:59:20,754
No, I didn't come
to India to meet Prem.

1305
01:59:21,036 --> 01:59:23,225
I was here to see my mother's grave.

1306
01:59:24,098 --> 01:59:28,598
I didn't even know that Prem was here.
I suddenly met him.

1307
01:59:28,949 --> 01:59:30,670
Sure I understand.

1308
01:59:31,065 --> 01:59:34,366
A girl sets off from
Vienna to go to Singapore...

1309
01:59:34,850 --> 01:59:37,955
she gets down at Bombay.
Then, she goes to Malaga.

1310
01:59:38,409 --> 01:59:42,127
Where the population is around
3 lakhs and out of all these people...

1311
01:59:42,247 --> 01:59:45,247
she meets the only one
person whom sheshould not meet.

1312
01:59:45,501 --> 01:59:47,402
You want me to believe this story.

1313
01:59:47,522 --> 01:59:49,800
You can ask nanny.
This is true.

1314
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:50,952
No, my dear.

1315
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:53,643
Truth is,
you told a lie to your father.

1316
01:59:53,763 --> 01:59:57,352
You came here to meet Prem.
You didn't expect, I would come here.

1317
01:59:57,523 --> 01:59:59,692
And you were caught red-handed.

1318
01:59:59,849 --> 02:00:03,126
Papa, please believe me.
You know, I never lie.

1319
02:00:03,246 --> 02:00:09,819
You can lie... for an Indian
blood flows through your veins.

1320
02:00:10,228 --> 02:00:12,489
Your mother too was a liar,
so what if you lie.

1321
02:00:12,698 --> 02:00:14,714
- Papa.
- Do not shout.

1322
02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:19,864
You did what you wished.
Get ready.

1323
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:22,459
We are going back to Vienna.

1324
02:00:33,112 --> 02:00:35,938
- Prem...
- Sonia... - That.

1325
02:00:35,997 --> 02:00:41,228
Sonia, no need to utter a word.
There is no need to explain anything.

1326
02:00:42,759 --> 02:00:48,345
I know this is not my story...
whose end I can write myself.

1327
02:00:50,591 --> 02:00:52,876
For someone else has written my fate.

1328
02:00:53,965 --> 02:01:00,700
And there are only two pages of
this story. The first and the last.

1329
02:01:02,252 --> 02:01:07,967
- Some stories are short.
- I can't explain...

1330
02:01:08,139 --> 02:01:11,839
I told you,
there's no need to explain.

1331
02:01:13,770 --> 02:01:16,694
I know the end of my story.

1332
02:01:18,871 --> 02:01:20,598
I am sorry, Prem.

1333
02:01:25,423 --> 02:01:26,673
When are you going?

1334
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,166
Day after tomorrow.

1335
02:01:32,566 --> 02:01:38,340
You can't but the
time can stand still.

1336
02:01:41,512 --> 02:01:43,804
Why are you getting so emotional?

1337
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:50,396
You are a guide. People will
enter your life and will leave.

1338
02:01:52,888 --> 02:01:58,085
People come and go in this city.
But not in the life of Tony guide.

1339
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:05,633
I understand.
I can understand your feelings.

1340
02:02:05,874 --> 02:02:08,233
But I cannot stay here.

1341
02:02:08,444 --> 02:02:12,089
And for how else?
One day I will have to go, isn't it?

1342
02:02:14,017 --> 02:02:19,061
You are absolutely right, Madam.
You don't stay for me.

1343
02:02:22,055 --> 02:02:23,716
Once you leave...

1344
02:02:24,924 --> 02:02:27,465
I too will leave
this city and go somewhere.

1345
02:02:28,936 --> 02:02:35,734
When you are gone, I'll miss
you at everyplace in this city.

1346
02:02:38,543 --> 02:02:43,597
But I don't know, where will I go?

1347
02:02:49,110 --> 02:02:53,289
- Tony. - What?
- There's one place.

1348
02:02:53,699 --> 02:02:54,699
Where?

1349
02:02:55,124 --> 02:02:56,131
Vienna.

1350
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:00,482
With you?!

1351
02:03:01,518 --> 02:03:04,212
- If you don't mind, can I ask you something.
- Go on.

1352
02:03:05,292 --> 02:03:08,042
Who will explain it to your father?

1353
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:09,491
I will do it.

1354
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:10,999
Who is that?

1355
02:03:14,145 --> 02:03:15,467
Do you have a passport?

1356
02:03:15,507 --> 02:03:17,053
Yes. I had got it made to go to Dubai.

1357
02:03:17,173 --> 02:03:19,373
- Leave it at the hotel tomorrow.
- I don't have a visa.

1358
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:21,039
I'll take care of everything.

1359
02:03:21,079 --> 02:03:24,516
Madam, may I ask you something?
You were testing me, isn't it?

1360
02:03:25,535 --> 02:03:26,329
- No, Tony.
- No.

1361
02:03:26,372 --> 02:03:30,335
- Promise. - I promise.
- You were testing me.

1362
02:03:32,838 --> 02:03:37,415
Neena! Madam! Boom! Boom!

1363
02:03:45,579 --> 02:03:49,080
Please prepare properly.

1364
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:53,460
Take it.

1365
02:03:55,133 --> 02:03:59,785
I don't believe it.
Is it a dream or a reality?

1366
02:04:00,874 --> 02:04:05,163
Look at me, I'm an ordinary
guide while she's a princess.

1367
02:04:05,796 --> 02:04:10,740
One thing is for sure, Neena.
An astrologer had told me...

1368
02:04:11,302 --> 02:04:15,780
a princess will come in
my life whom I'll love very much...

1369
02:04:16,125 --> 02:04:18,823
and she'll take me away with her.

1370
02:04:19,945 --> 02:04:21,604
Isn't it a wonderful fairy tale?!

1371
02:04:25,315 --> 02:04:33,134
You are crying!
Get up... come on.

1372
02:04:33,254 --> 02:04:38,105
Sit... you are an idiot.

1373
02:04:38,551 --> 02:04:41,294
You think I'll leave
you here forget you?

1374
02:04:41,452 --> 02:04:42,998
Don't I know, after Madam...

1375
02:04:43,038 --> 02:04:45,719
only Neena loves me
the most in the entire world.

1376
02:04:48,865 --> 02:04:54,425
On reaching there I'll tell
Madam to arrange a nice job for me.

1377
02:04:55,871 --> 02:04:57,637
Then, I'll call you there.

1378
02:04:59,477 --> 02:05:03,306
Unless I tease you
I can't digest my food.

1379
02:05:06,788 --> 02:05:10,985
I'm writing my house in your
name and still you are crying.

1380
02:05:14,030 --> 02:05:18,678
Don't cry Neena...

1381
02:05:19,285 --> 02:05:24,831
when you cry
something happens to me.

1382
02:05:27,267 --> 02:05:28,319
Please.

1383
02:05:43,415 --> 02:05:45,917
I know Tony doesn't love me.

1384
02:05:47,688 --> 02:05:50,421
He hasn't even seen me properly.

1385
02:05:52,106 --> 02:05:59,318
Maybe because we don't care
for the things which we possess.

1386
02:06:02,718 --> 02:06:07,699
And then,
Sonia came in between us.

1387
02:06:10,308 --> 02:06:12,316
I'm not sad about this.

1388
02:06:14,112 --> 02:06:19,349
Because my happiness
lies in his happiness.

1389
02:06:22,189 --> 02:06:25,786
Who else do I have except Tony?

1390
02:06:29,054 --> 02:06:34,657
I'm very happy today, Tony.

1391
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:37,463
Sir, I sent the luggage.

1392
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:41,131
But where's Sonia?
The flight is at 12 o' clock.

1393
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:43,873
I will see.

1394
02:07:15,882 --> 02:07:18,775
How are you related to Jennifer?

1395
02:07:19,310 --> 02:07:20,881
She was my mother.

1396
02:07:21,001 --> 02:07:23,593
- So, you are Haynes daughter?
- Yes.

1397
02:07:25,547 --> 02:07:28,005
I want to talk to you.
Come with me.

1398
02:07:43,558 --> 02:07:45,615
Why did you let her go? Why?

1399
02:07:45,735 --> 02:07:48,868
Why didn't you tell
her that I'll be late.

1400
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:37,008
Why did you let her go?
Where has she gone?

1401
02:08:40,619 --> 02:08:42,242
- Sonia.
- O my God.

1402
02:08:42,282 --> 02:08:44,366
Where had you been?
We are getting late.

1403
02:08:44,486 --> 02:08:47,286
- Papa I want to talk to you urgently.
- I don't want to hear anything.

1404
02:08:47,332 --> 02:08:49,160
The flight is taking off.
Get inside.

1405
02:08:49,217 --> 02:08:52,821
- But papa, please.
- Get inside. Come on.

1406
02:08:57,422 --> 02:08:58,960
Where's the passport?

1407
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:00,508
I've got it.

1408
02:09:01,197 --> 02:09:04,361
Forgive me Tony.
I made a mistake.

1409
02:09:04,996 --> 02:09:07,120
I had dreamt about many things.
About you and me.

1410
02:09:07,303 --> 02:09:14,448
But I forgot,
dreams never come true...

1411
02:09:14,568 --> 02:09:21,323
one can only live on hopes.

1412
02:09:21,873 --> 02:09:27,880
You are lucky,
you got what you wished for.

1413
02:09:28,902 --> 02:09:32,285
The one you loved is with you.

1414
02:09:32,891 --> 02:09:35,164
In every church of Malaga...

1415
02:09:35,438 --> 02:09:38,580
I'll light a candle for
your happiness and long life.

1416
02:09:39,388 --> 02:09:42,593
Enjoy yourself as
you used to do it here.

1417
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:47,925
Don't worry about me.
You enjoy.

1418
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:51,651
I'll try to live without you.

1419
02:09:52,791 --> 02:09:55,280
I'll live alone Tony.
Don't worry about me. I'll live Tony.

1420
02:09:55,546 --> 02:09:58,800
Hey Tony! What are you doing here?
C'mon, we've to check in.

1421
02:10:01,696 --> 02:10:05,128
Madam I'll not go with you.

1422
02:10:06,565 --> 02:10:09,920
- What?
- I'll not go with you.

1423
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:12,480
You were so excited to go and now...

1424
02:10:13,734 --> 02:10:19,520
I only thought about my happiness
so I couldn't see anything else.

1425
02:10:20,875 --> 02:10:25,600
But today I've realized
after so many years.

1426
02:10:26,408 --> 02:10:34,408
- Tony!
- Madam, I know, you love me very much.

1427
02:10:38,146 --> 02:10:41,935
You've convinced
your father to marry me.

1428
02:10:42,602 --> 02:10:44,040
- Tony...
- But Madam...

1429
02:10:44,991 --> 02:10:51,656
- I mean...
- I know, you can bestow me with happiness, wealth and love.

1430
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:56,480
But that will be at the
cost of someone's sorrow.

1431
02:10:59,772 --> 02:11:01,613
That Neena...

1432
02:11:02,554 --> 02:11:06,040
she'll be all alone when I go away.

1433
02:11:06,607 --> 02:11:09,047
- She has no one of her own. She will be very lonely.
- Neena...

1434
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:12,274
I can understand,
you must be thinking...

1435
02:11:12,485 --> 02:11:14,517
why Neena has transpired suddenly.

1436
02:11:15,124 --> 02:11:18,721
But that poor girl was right
with me from the very beginning.

1437
02:11:20,868 --> 02:11:25,390
She loves me a lot.
I realised it today.

1438
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:28,656
I am everything for her.

1439
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,058
She'll die if I go away.

1440
02:11:35,380 --> 02:11:36,720
She'll definitely... die.

1441
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:43,724
It's difficult to suppress one's love.

1442
02:11:45,059 --> 02:11:48,848
But to break the heart of
one who loves you is a grave sin.

1443
02:11:51,543 --> 02:11:57,262
And this sin, Tony will not commit.
Please forgive me.

1444
02:12:03,685 --> 02:12:04,977
I am sorry.

1445
02:12:13,046 --> 02:12:16,023
Sonia my darling!
When are we going?

1446
02:12:16,397 --> 02:12:19,080
Where is there mad
crazy boy of yours?

1447
02:12:19,729 --> 02:12:20,734
He has left.

1448
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:22,794
I knew it was bound to happen.

1449
02:12:22,914 --> 02:12:25,344
These people never keep their word.

1450
02:12:25,421 --> 02:12:27,948
He might have landed some
other job better than ours.

1451
02:12:28,026 --> 02:12:30,222
So he left.
Scoundrel! Greedy!

1452
02:12:31,057 --> 02:12:37,266
No papa, that greedy
Indian rejected your daughter.

1453
02:12:37,708 --> 02:12:40,459
What nonsense!
What are you talking?

1454
02:12:41,126 --> 02:12:46,576
I was frank with him.
He thought I was in love with him.

1455
02:12:47,276 --> 02:12:49,993
And I wanted to marry him.

1456
02:12:50,033 --> 02:12:53,044
Scoundrel!
How dare he?

1457
02:12:54,083 --> 02:13:00,553
Papa, agreed Tony is poor.
But his dreams were high.

1458
02:13:01,441 --> 02:13:05,425
And today he shattered his
dreams because he realised that...

1459
02:13:05,857 --> 02:13:11,432
Neena loved him and he rejected me,
your wealth...

1460
02:13:12,099 --> 02:13:16,048
and his dream of
being a rich man. All for her.

1461
02:13:17,308 --> 02:13:20,584
And whatever I dreamt...

1462
02:13:21,369 --> 02:13:25,177
I shattered it for
your respect your love.

1463
02:13:27,583 --> 02:13:32,472
That was not a dream Papa.
That was love, true love!

1464
02:13:34,047 --> 02:13:36,037
Which I have understood today.

1465
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:43,581
You gave me all the happiness...

1466
02:13:44,252 --> 02:13:47,598
but today I beg you for my love.

1467
02:13:49,452 --> 02:13:53,859
Prem is the biggest
happiness of my life.

1468
02:13:54,764 --> 02:13:56,500
I want to live with him.

1469
02:13:56,833 --> 02:14:01,855
I'll not let you meet
that bloody journalist.

1470
02:14:02,590 --> 02:14:04,515
He is an Indian.

1471
02:14:04,687 --> 02:14:09,015
He'll cheat you,
just like your mother left us alone.

1472
02:14:09,135 --> 02:14:11,560
My mother didn't cheat us.

1473
02:14:11,946 --> 02:14:15,882
But she had learnt, she was suffering
from some dangerous disease.

1474
02:14:16,298 --> 02:14:19,475
So she returned alone to Malaga.

1475
02:14:20,275 --> 02:14:22,883
So that you and I could live.

1476
02:14:23,061 --> 02:14:27,274
In a country where
loves means sacrifice...

1477
02:14:27,919 --> 02:14:31,485
how can a woman of
that country be a cheat?

1478
02:14:32,663 --> 02:14:38,128
Only an Indian can make
such a big sacrifice.

1479
02:14:44,961 --> 02:14:49,236
Papa, these are the letters
that mummy wrote to you.

1480
02:14:49,655 --> 02:14:51,636
But she never mailed them.

1481
02:14:51,918 --> 02:14:55,836
Thank you. I'll ask
your mother for forgiveness.

1482
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:00,436
And you go to Prem,
whom you love.

1483
02:15:01,774 --> 02:15:07,147
- Thank you papa. - I am sorry.
- Thank you, thank you.

1484
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:23,042
You remember,
I had said, if your love is true...

1485
02:15:23,403 --> 02:15:27,555
he will definitely come back to you.

1486
02:15:28,524 --> 02:15:30,689
Look, I have returned.

1487
02:15:35,075 --> 02:15:36,374
You also eat.

1488
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:39,857
I've decided, I'll always have
my food after you have it.

1489
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:41,773
- Any problem?
- No.

1490
02:15:46,138 --> 02:15:47,138
What happened, Tony?

1491
02:15:47,695 --> 02:15:50,633
- Sonia madam has followed me here.
- Yes.

1492
02:15:52,807 --> 02:15:54,870
She didn't go with her father.

1493
02:15:56,092 --> 02:15:57,287
How could she?

1494
02:15:58,579 --> 02:16:00,736
Her love is here.

1495
02:16:04,579 --> 02:16:07,290
- How much will I hurt her?
- Yes.

1496
02:16:08,572 --> 02:16:11,593
She looks pale.
She looks gloomy.

1497
02:16:15,690 --> 02:16:23,690
Look at her plight,
she can neither laugh nor cry.

1498
02:16:25,173 --> 02:16:27,088
Doesn't matter.
It happens in love.

1499
02:16:27,529 --> 02:16:30,369
She'll overcome as time passes by.
What to do? I'm only one. Go on, eat.

1500
02:16:31,813 --> 02:16:34,696
Do not worry Tony.
Everything think will be all right.

1501
02:16:34,749 --> 02:16:37,842
Look Tony is sitting there.
Go and thank him.

1502
02:16:38,228 --> 02:16:41,305
Had it not been for him,
we wouldn't have met.

1503
02:16:41,701 --> 02:16:45,409
- Anyway that thing...
- No need to say anything.

1504
02:16:47,373 --> 02:16:49,685
Let him think that a princess
came from a far off country...

1505
02:16:49,709 --> 02:16:52,115
who loved him very much.

1506
02:16:53,151 --> 02:16:56,796
And he rejected the
princess for an ordinary girl.

1507
02:16:59,021 --> 02:17:05,797
Some dreams are so beautiful
that you can't shatter them.
