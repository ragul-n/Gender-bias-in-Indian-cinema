1
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,560
Is that for a dice game?

2
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
Let's play a game before we start praying.

3
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
If you lose you won't
take any remuneration.

4
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,400
If you win I will give you double money.

5
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,840
It's a chart of sun signs,
planets and stars.

6
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,280
It's horoscope.

7
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,960
It looks similar so I got confused.

8
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
Twenty five.

9
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,960
Check out how much I scored?

10
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
Who asked you to do this?

11
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,480
I thought it was my turn.

12
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
You are fooling around with the planets.

13
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,360
You'll be ruined.

14
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Let me check out the horoscope.

15
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,680
This is no ordinary horoscope.

16
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
You get such a horoscope one in a million.

17
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,440
Whose horoscope is this?

18
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,520
One who stands out in a million, my son.

19
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
You are expressing joy
and God is expressing sorrow.

20
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,240
What?!

21
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,440
Just imagine that you've made
a house after spending a lot of money,

22
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,800
Suddenly you find the
roof and the floor missing.

23
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,520
You are hanging around.

24
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
Hanging around.

25
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,480
Will a liver tonic help?

26
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,080
Liver tonic helps to cure
liver ailments not planets.

27
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,440
What's the remedy?

28
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,400
Fate can't be changed.

29
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,800
Your son is like date juice.

30
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,040
He is sweet in the morning
but strong intoxicating at night.

31
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,600
What if we don't have it?

32
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,080
Total loss.

33
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,000
Your son is moving around freely.

34
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,760
He'll take advantage of anyone
and won't spare even his father.

35
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,960
You've helped us.

36
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
Your married life
will be a very happy one.

37
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,480
- Adi , hurry up.
- Wish you good luck.

38
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,600
Quick.

39
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,000
- Everything is fair and lovely.
- Let's go.

40
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,720
- Bye.
- Bye.

41
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,360
You Idiot.

42
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,400
Here people are scared even of my shadow.

43
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,480
An outsider came here
and kidnapped Shruti?!

44
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,680
This means an insider is involved.

45
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,760
If it proves to be
true I'll slit his throat.

46
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,120
I want Shruti here before evening. Go.

47
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,560
- Coach number?
- S5

48
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,240
Do you know Adi used his brains
and not brawns to bring me here?

49
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,760
Simple theory. Use brains
and if not successful then brawns.

50
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,880
Come on. Come on.

51
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,000
Bye. Inform everyone in your house.

52
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Have a safe journey.

53
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
- Listen.
- Tell me.

54
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,680
Shut your father up.

55
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,440
If he finds out I've eloped with a girl...

56
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,600
...he'll inform everyone
from Kalighat to California.

57
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,760
- Okay?
- Okay.

58
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

59
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,320
An hour ago this place was
buzzing with wedding activities.

60
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,840
It was Dibakar Roy's sister's wedding.

61
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,640
The ritual of applying turmeric was over.

62
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,960
The NRI groom had come down from abroad.

63
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,280
The marriage was supposed
to take place from this house.

64
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,440
But a stranger mingled
with the wedding guests and...

65
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,680
...kidnapped the bride Shruti.

66
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,840
Well-done! This is love.

67
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,640
What's the matter?

68
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,000
Just see what has happened.
A hen's egg has been stolen.

69
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,760
What are you saying?!

70
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,240
Yes! Mafia king Dibakar Roy's
sister has been kidnapped by a boy.

71
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,680
- Oh no!
- I feel like dancing.

72
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,760
If you do such things
you'll land in problem.

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,720
Don't watch this news.

74
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,880
Dev!

75
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,760
Uncle is here.

76
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,440
Uncle, do you've a cello tape at home?

77
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,360
Why?

78
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,720
Adi has asked us to
shut your mouth with it.

79
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
There is breaking news for you.

80
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,240
The news is on television.

81
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,800
A boy has eloped with
Dibakar Roy's sister.

82
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,080
You know the boy very well.

83
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,360
- Is it?
- Yes.

84
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,240
Who is he?

85
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,040
- Adi.
- Adi!

86
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,200
Oh no! What happened?

87
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,040
What has happened?

88
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,800
Insufficient sugar. Add sugar to it.

89
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,480
His tongue is still working.

90
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,680
Not just my tongue but
all the five senses are working.

91
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Just now you were feeling unwell.
What's wrong?

92
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Trouble. Your son
has landed me in trouble.

93
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,960
He is pulling me into trouble.

94
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,400
Where is he?

95
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,320
Outstation.

96
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,720
Is he in Kharagpur or out of Kharagpur?

97
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,640
- Out.
- Good!

98
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,280
He has left A1 city.
We won't be able to trace him.

99
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,480
Uncle, Dibakar's men are
searching for Adi's parents...

100
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,040
...so that they can get him.

101
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,880
If they find out that you
are his father they'll thrash you.

102
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,280
Father? Who is his father?

103
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,880
I don't have a son.

104
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,120
Oh no! Uncle.

105
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,480
What craziness is this?

106
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,680
This isn't craziness.
I'm erasing any proof in my full senses.

107
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,040
If anyone questions you tell
them that no one in our family...

108
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,440
...has a name beginning with A.

109
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,280
Also tell them we are childless.
We are still planning.

110
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,600
Good morning, mother.

111
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,520
- Where are you?
- Benaras.

112
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
- Benaras?
- Yes, mother.

113
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
Don't worry.
I'm staying at Sudip's place and...

114
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,960
...am absolutely fine.

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,240
The person with whose
sister you've eloped...

116
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,960
...is searching you madly.

117
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,680
Don't come back to Kolkata. Got me?

118
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,560
Since you are in Benaras
visit the temple and offer prayers.

119
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,080
If guys have mothers like you
they'll unhesitatingly kidnap girls.

120
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,840
Don't worry,
I haven't eloped with the girl for myself.

121
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,280
It was for Sudip.

122
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,920
He'll marry her
and go for honeymoon and...

123
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,840
...I'll enjoy in the holy city of Benaras.

124
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,680
Everything is fair and lovely, mother.

125
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,600
She is very beautiful.

126
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,320
God takes great care
to create some people.

127
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,320
Rai. She studies in
Benaras' Sampurnand College.

128
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,720
Kill the girl.

129
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,960
He eloped with Shruti
right before your eyes and...

130
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,840
...you were waving them goodbye.

131
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,160
You couldn't even find out where
are the parents and friends of the guy.

132
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,040
You all just love eating and sleeping.
Scoundrels!

133
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
- Brother.
- What's the matter?

134
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,160
Shruti hasn't been kidnapped.

135
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,680
What are you saying?

136
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,320
Yes brother,
she has willingly eloped with that guy.

137
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,840
Hey!

138
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,360
I'll pull out your tongue.

139
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,560
Don't speak anything against my sister.

140
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
Brother, he is right.

141
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
Shruti has an affair with that guy.

142
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Shruti called that guy.

143
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,440
What are you saying, Bhaskar?

144
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,360
You've become a family member now.

145
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,960
How did you get to know this?

146
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,640
The guy had called
Shruti after coming here.

147
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,120
Go and check everything.

148
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
You are right.

149
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,840
- Sir, when did you come? Greetings.
- Greetings.

150
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,040
Where are you?

151
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,720
- Shruti, I've come.
- Very good.

152
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,760
Please excuse me, I want to freshen up.

153
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,400
Okay.

154
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,160
It's a wedding house and
you know how stressful it is.

155
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,120
Yes Shruti.

156
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
To the right or straight?

157
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,160
Come upstairs from the hall and--

158
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,120
Shruti!

159
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,320
- You?!
- Yes. It's me.

160
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
I wanted to meet you.

161
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Whenever I come here someone
or the other comes to talk to you.

162
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,840
Is anyone in the room?

163
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,160
Why did you come to my room at this time?

164
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,600
My friends will think that
I've asked them to go away from...

165
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
...the room as I wanted to meet you.

166
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,200
Whom are you looking at?

167
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,080
Don't look there. My aunt.

168
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,440
Close your eyes once.

169
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,400
What?! Close my eyes? Why?

170
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,600
I've a surprise gift for you.

171
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,880
How will I see the surprise
gift if I close my eyes?

172
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,320
It won't take long.
Close your eyes for a second.

173
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,760
Okay, hurry up. Fast.

174
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,640
Open your eyes.

175
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,120
Perfume!

176
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,280
I've got it for you from Italy.

177
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,600
- Such a nice gift. Let me apply it.
- Yes.

178
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,320
It's so--

179
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,120
Hold on. Let me call and get the car.

180
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,760
Oh no! no network.

181
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,080
Here, make the call from this phone.

182
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,120
Hello, quickly get the
car at the back of the house.

183
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,680
Hurry up. Quick.

184
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,880
Come on.

185
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,280
If he made the call from
your phone then call that number.

186
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,600
- Check the number.
- Yes.

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,200
- This is the number.
- Dial it.

188
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,720
It's ringing.

189
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,040
Hello. Hello!

190
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,160
Hello! Is it brother?

191
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,080
Why are you quiet? Say something.

192
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,360
Are you angry?

193
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,360
Don't get angry.
I went to Dibakar's house.

194
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,360
I saw two guys standing
there so I came back.

195
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,440
Brother, you've eloped
with the girl. Right?

196
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,880
I knew it. I knew you could do it.

197
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,680
If you are asked to elope
with Shiva's daughters...

198
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,600
...Lakshmi and Saraswati
you can even do that.

199
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,880
What kind of goon is he?

200
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,520
You eloped with his sister
and he didn't get to know anything.

201
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,280
Ask him to sell coconut in local trains.

202
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Dibakar speaking.

203
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,080
Dibakar! How are you, sir?

204
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,480
Where is my sister?

205
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,240
I'm a simple man.

206
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,160
How will I know about
anyone's sister or mother?

207
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,520
He had asked me to come
with my car and I had come.

208
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,800
Who? Who had asked you come?

209
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,720
I'll be in trouble if I take his name.

210
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,120
I don't know him.
It was an international call.

211
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,080
I feel he must be some don from Dubai.

212
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,920
I want his number.
Give me his number.

213
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,480
Disconnect the cal,
I'll message the number.

214
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,680
Hello! Scoundrel!

215
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,800
Save this number.

216
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,960
Let me block the number
else I'll be in problem.

217
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,960
It's hard to find girls
below 25 in Benaras.

218
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,240
Now we've to find someone
you've seen at the banks of Benaras.

219
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,680
You don't even know her name and address.

220
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,360
Listen brother,
those who study here don't visit temples.

221
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,320
Girls who visit temples and
who study here are completely different.

222
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,880
Girls who visit temple light lamps...

223
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:31,240
...and those who study here
play around with guys. Got me?

224
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,440
Hey! Hey!

225
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
Why is he running away in that manner?

226
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
He must have come across Rai.

227
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,920
Rai? Who is she?

228
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,560
There is a girls' gang in this college.

229
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,560
They get hold of a
guy everyday and rag them.

230
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,880
Rai is their leader.

231
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,320
She is a girl but she is shrewd.

232
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,760
She catches boys and tortures them.

233
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,040
It seems as if guys
are her eternal enemies.

234
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,440
Wow! She appears to be someone unique.

235
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,360
I have to see this girl.

236
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,120
Don't do that, you'll be in problem.

237
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,760
I'll give you an example.
Try to understand what I mean.

238
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,840
She is like spicy puffed
rice in a sweet biscuit's packet.

239
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,600
Don't worry, come with me.

240
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,960
She is the girl I saw at the river bank.

241
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,200
So, she is the girl. Oh no!

242
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,600
So, you haven't slept for a night for her.

243
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,880
If she gets to know it, you
won't be able to sleep your entire life.

244
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,200
You'll suffer from insomnia.

245
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,920
You'll keep loitering
around her house at night.

246
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,560
Shut up! Can't anyone
judge a girl by her looks?

247
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,720
No, one can't.

248
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,720
You can't understand when
an art film ends similarly...

249
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,200
...you won't understand
when you'll land in problem.

250
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,920
Listen brother, pour a pot full of Ganga
water on your head and forget the girl.

251
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,200
Just shut up!

252
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,960
I've taken a step forward
and now Aditya won't back off.

253
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,160
If I see her roaming
around with someone else...

254
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,320
...it'll break my heart.

255
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,280
- What is her name?
- Rai.

256
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,440
Yes Rai! Rai means Radha
and Aditya means Krishna.

257
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,560
That's why I was wondering
why she was attracting me.

258
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,680
Come on.

259
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,280
Now hit each other
on the head with the scale.

260
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,560
One who quits first will be the loser.

261
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,040
He has to give us a treat every week.

262
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,240
What if I win?

263
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,960
If you win take her for a film every week.

264
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,400
Done.

265
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Arpita, bow your head down.

266
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,920
I'll buy two tickets
of corner seats. Okay?

267
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,200
Oh god!

268
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,520
Bow your head down.

269
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:43,960
Did you get hurt?

270
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,280
- What happened, dear?
- Nothing. Nothing.

271
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,680
I'll get tickets of a flop film.

272
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,800
- The theatre will be empty.
- Okay.

273
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,520
Oh no! What happened? Did it hurt?

274
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,280
Same scale.

275
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,600
- Hit me with my one.
- Okay.

276
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,360
Let me go else I'll lose my job. Okay?

277
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
What happened, dear?

278
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,040
My head is full of potato bumps.

279
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,560
We'll grow potatoes on your
head now and then sell potato chips.

280
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,800
I want to go home.

281
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,840
Why? Won't you take her for a film?

282
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,040
No, granny told me to come home early.

283
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,280
There is eclipse today.

284
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,200
It has already started.

285
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,600
I hope now you know what the
result of running is after girls.

286
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,680
You've got just bumps this
time see what happens next time.

287
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,240
You too don't act like him.
Get this in your head.

288
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,360
I will keep it in my heart.

289
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,600
I'll take it out at
times and express love.

290
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,960
Everything is fair and lovely.

291
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,280
Listen, if her brother gets
to know that you are after her...

292
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,560
...you'll meet the same fate as others.

293
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,720
Now you are here but
you'll vanish in no time.

294
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,920
Hey! Entire Benaras knows that
falling in love with my sister...

295
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,040
...is same as committing suicide.

296
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:49,080
One love. One bullet. One life.

297
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,640
- Brother, check the problem in the car.
- I'm checking it.

298
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,520
How long will it take?

299
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,120
Big brother, he is saying that
it'll take him 3-4 days to repair the car.

300
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,880
Shall I get a car from Kolkata?

301
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,960
It'll take a lot of time.

302
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,920
Hire a car from here.

303
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
Want to hire your car.

304
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,680
Where will you go?

305
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,560
- I'll decide after getting in.
- Come in.

306
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Come on.

307
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,840
What's your name?

308
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,840
I'm Nepal Das,
the owner cum driver of this car.

309
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,320
Your voice sounds familiar.

310
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,240
You are on FM right? Radio jockey?

311
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,880
Get going.

312
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,200
Okay.

313
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,560
Look at him.

314
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,880
- This is fun.
- Right.

315
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,760
Hi!

316
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,760
He is not showing any interest in you.

317
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,320
Some guys are like this.

318
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,880
Let me increase the dose.

319
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,880
Hello!

320
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,080
Oh no! he insulted
you in middle of the road.

321
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,760
First time,
first time someone has ignored me.

322
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,080
If I don't make him run
after me then my name is not Rai.

323
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,760
He is over there.

324
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,560
Why did he come here?

325
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,200
To get killed by me.

326
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
Wait here, I'll soon be back.
Just see the drama.

327
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,040
Why are you showing off so much?

328
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,200
Do you know the heart beat
of guys increase when I pass by them?

329
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,320
I get 100 love messages
daily and you are ignoring me.

330
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,680
Stop!

331
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,080
Why are you so arrogant?

332
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Do you want me to fall at your feet?

333
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,120
If I wish I can make you
sit before me throughout the day.

334
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,680
It'll happen very soon.

335
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,280
You'll stay throughout
the day and night with me.

336
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,160
You'll be inside and I'll be outside.

337
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,160
I'll keep you inside lock
up throughout the night and...

338
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,560
...then take you court the next day.

339
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,960
What do you mean?

340
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,920
Inspector Vijay Srivastav.
Chief of anti-ragging.

341
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,680
The government has given
me the duty to straighten up...

342
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,920
...the rogue students of
the colleges throughout the country.

343
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,160
Rai. Isn't it?
Sampurnanada College, third year student.

344
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,840
There are many complaints
of ragging against you.

345
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,640
- Actually--
- You've lots of talents. See you soon.

346
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,000
Inspector Vijay Srivastava.

347
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,560
After all this there won't be
any ragging in college from tomorrow.

348
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
- I want ragging to happen.
- Right!

349
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,360
What?! Why?

350
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,440
If there isn't any ragging then how will
Inspector Vijay Srivastava go there?

351
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,360
Oh no! Will you go to college again?

352
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,720
How will I get her if I don't go?

353
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,760
What do you think? That you'll
try to get her and she'll give in?

354
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,000
Listen, all girls give
in but they take their time.

355
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,680
The right guy should
be before them. Got it?

356
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,560
Rai, my dear,
I want to give an advice as a big brother.

357
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,600
Stay away from this guy.

358
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,880
Tomorrow is Friday. Beware. Don't give in.

359
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
Rai!

360
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,200
Where did you vanish yesterday?

361
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,000
I called you so many times
but you didn't receive the call.

362
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,560
What happened? Tell us.

363
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,880
What can happen?
He apologized and I forgave him.

364
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,080
Rai! We've got hold of him. Come on.

365
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,840
Do you know what he has done today?

366
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,560
He had written my name
on the bathroom wall.

367
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,880
Go and erase her name. Okay? Go.

368
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,040
Okay. Thank you.

369
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,280
What? He will go away?
I'll apply third degree on him today.

370
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,080
No. no. no, third degree.

371
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,080
We've become good girls from today.

372
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,920
No ragging. Okay?

373
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,840
What do you mean?

374
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,000
Is this you who is saying this?

375
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,200
Yes, I'm saying this.

376
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,000
You are not getting my point.

377
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,080
From today we'll start
anti-ragging campaign. Got it?

378
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,800
- What?!
- Yes.

379
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,640
I'll be the flag in your hands.

380
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
Stop! Stop!

381
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,080
Leave him. Leave him.

382
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,520
Sir, sir, write an FIR.
They are harassing a child.

383
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,560
- Are you a child? Grown up monkey!
- Sir!

384
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,720
If he is a monkey then what are you?

385
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,480
Sir, sir, all the boys are
leaving the university because of them.

386
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,320
The guys are not safe here.

387
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,120
They molest us on every pretext.

388
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,760
Who is your leader? Who is your leader?

389
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,320
Let me see. Let me see. Lift up your face.

390
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh it's you.

391
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,560
We were supposed to spend
a night and day together.

392
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,160
What's going on here?

393
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,760
What's this?

394
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,520
These small boys come to college
to study and want to become...

395
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,360
...like Rammohan,
Netaji Subhash and Vidyasagar.

396
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,440
And you? You are ragging them
and throwing them out of the college.

397
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,680
This guy won't stop
until he gets me fired.

398
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,640
As a result they become alcoholic,
gambler or chain snatcher.

399
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,840
You've increased crime in Benaras.

400
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,760
Whom are you explaining, sir?

401
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,640
How will they understand
the importance of education?

402
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,720
They come to college
to show off latest trends.

403
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,600
Can't you see they've worn clothes
from kids' wear and come to college?

404
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,120
- Talk respectfully about women.
- Okay, sir.

405
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Look who is talking.

406
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,280
Henceforth I'll come to college
daily and keep an eye on you.

407
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,000
If needed I'll sit next to you.

408
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,720
If I wish I'll take you with me because...

409
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,800
...everything is fair and lovely.

410
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,440
Come.

411
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,760
Rai, give donation. Give donation.

412
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,400
- Donation for what?
- For Saraswati (goddess of learning)Puja.

413
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,320
They are from Assi Ghat.

414
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,560
They've decided to organize
Saraswati puja this year.

415
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,160
No one in this house except you
has any relation with goddess Saraswati.

416
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,120
Give the first donation.

417
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,040
Kanaida, I'll bear the
entire expense of the veneration.

418
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,520
You need to do one thing for me. Please.

419
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,440
What is it? I'll do it several times.

420
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,840
Inspector Vijay Srivastava
is disturbing me a lot.

421
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
I can't attend university because of him.

422
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,440
Just straighten him up.

423
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,240
No issues.
Court and police is in our hands.

424
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,720
Write a big amount of donation in the
name of the inspector Vijay Srivastava.

425
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,880
If he doesn't give donation
chop off his hands.

426
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,840
Okay.

427
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,040
No, no, don't chop off his hands.

428
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,000
Just straighten him up a bit.

429
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,960
No, we'll just scare him.

430
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,400
Go to college without worries.

431
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,800
Take this. Is it enough?

432
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,040
Enough? This is a lot.

433
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,880
Take this. What will you do with this?

434
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,320
We've written a very
small amount in it. Go. Go.

435
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,320
Vijay Srivastava.

436
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,560
Yesterday I fooled him
into giving 5000 rupees.

437
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,040
- Rai madam.
- Yes.

438
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,360
Hello. I'm inspector Vijay Srivastava.

439
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,520
- You are inspector Vijay Srivastava?
- Yes, madam.

440
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,640
- Vijay?!
- Vijay?!

441
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,320
You told your brother
that I've disturbed you.

442
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,280
I didn't even see you before.

443
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,880
Then who is that guy?
Let him speak.

444
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,920
Sorry, there is a misunderstanding.

445
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,600
- I'll talk to brother. You can go.
- Thank you, madam.

446
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,640
- Bye.
- Thank you.

447
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,160
What's the matter?

448
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,800
Oh my god!

449
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,040
I stayed put up in my house for
two days because of a fake police officer.

450
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,240
Tell your brother.

451
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,400
He'll break his bones
and make him apologize to you.

452
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,360
No, not brother. I'll do the needful.

453
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,040
I'll make him dance to my tunes.

454
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,760
Let him come to college tomorrow.

455
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,680
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

456
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,480
Get a cappuccino for sir.

457
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,040
Cappuccino?! Showering of
so much affection indicates trouble.

458
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,960
No, I won't have coffee today.

459
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,840
I'm in hurry.
I'll leave after a short round.

460
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,560
We'll finish the game in one round.

461
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,480
What game?

462
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
Girls, follow me.

463
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,280
"A crow wanted to become a cuckoo."

464
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,360
"But his cries gave his game away."

465
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,040
"Chant the name of Krishna."

466
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,240
"His plans have been exposed."

467
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,240
"Chant the name of Krishna."

468
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,000
Are you all Amitabh Bachchan fans? Me too.

469
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,600
Someday I'll take you out
for an Amitabh Bachchan film.

470
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,720
We'll show you an Amitabh Bachchan film.

471
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,120
You disguised as a police
officer and tried to fool me.

472
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,360
How dare you bluff me?

473
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,720
Do you know what I can do to you?

474
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,440
No, tell me.

475
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,680
- I'll apply your blood as nail polish.
- No! No! No!

476
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,080
This is turning out
to be very violent, Rai.

477
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,960
- Rai?
- Right.

478
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,720
- Rai?
- Right.

479
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
- Rai?
- Right. Right.

480
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,400
How dare you call me Rai?

481
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,360
Listen, when did we get so close?

482
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,240
From the very first day.

483
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Do you know what I feel?

484
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,240
We were a couple in our previous life.

485
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,320
Aditya. Aditya means
Krishna and Rai means Radha.

486
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,320
In my previous life when I used
to call you you came running to me.

487
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,320
I feel there'll be an action
replay of it in this life as well.

488
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,720
Stop being so over smart. Apologize.

489
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
I never apologize.

490
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,880
Apology makes love small.

491
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,760
I believe love always comes in king size.

492
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,440
Just shut up!

493
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,080
You won't be spared so easily.

494
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,800
I'm as dangerous as you are.

495
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,160
I'll make you run throughout Benaras.
Apologize.

496
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,400
Why are you repeating
the same thing again and again?

497
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,280
- What is this?
- Say sorry!

498
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,440
Was this good?

499
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,280
What do you mean by equally dangerous?

500
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,920
We are a hit couple.

501
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,560
I don't like hitting girls.

502
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,520
But sometimes it fills
up the gaps in love.

503
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,520
Well, people shouldn't get
to know what has happened between us.

504
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,800
Public must think that everything
is fair and lovely. Come on.

505
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,280
Just see her condition.

506
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,800
What was the sound of?

507
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,040
What creates such a sound?

508
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,920
- Shall I leave now?
- Yes, go.

509
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,840
If you stay here you'll get one more.

510
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
Stupid!

511
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,840
- Habu.
- Yes, big brother.

512
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,640
Call that scoundrel once again.

513
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,600
Yes, big brother.

514
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,840
It is ringing, big brother.

515
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,880
Hello. Who is it?

516
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,080
What's going on?

517
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,680
Who is speaking?

518
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,520
Stop the car and then speak. Stop!

519
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,880
Stupid! What are you saying?

520
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,440
If you are the legitimate son
of your father tell me where you are.

521
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,680
What will you do if I don't tell you?

522
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,080
Will you get sweets for me?

523
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,560
I'll behead you and hang your head,
scoundrel.

524
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,800
Give your threatening to someone else.

525
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,200
Don't come before me.

526
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
You'll be killed.

527
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,640
Listen, I'll definitely find you out.

528
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,840
You don't know what I will do to you.

529
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Don't make me angry.

530
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Bulls push, horses kick and
if I hit you'll go straight to god.

531
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,160
Hey! If I get hold of you once--

532
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,320
Find me out. If you try to find
me the petrol of your car will finish.

533
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,880
Your money will exhaust
but you'll get nothing.

534
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Did he say anything, brother?

535
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,560
- He ate up my head.
- He ate up my head.

536
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,760
- Where are we going?
- Straight.

537
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,880
- Hope you got it.
- Straight.

538
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,720
Go on.

539
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,160
You could've slapped me instead.

540
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,080
Trust me I wouldn't have minded at all.

541
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,960
Friends are like mother
they can slap each other.

542
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,800
But you slapped Rai.

543
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,240
Listen, some people are convinced
by flowers and others by slaps.

544
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,160
It varies.

545
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,800
These are steps to convince a girl.

546
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,480
There are different steps in dying too.

547
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,160
Some people don't die at once.

548
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,720
They die gradually.

549
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Now Rai will go home and
tell her brother everything.

550
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,320
He will send his men.

551
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
They'll come and calmly tell you--

552
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,120
Hey! What's wrong?
Why are you after my daughter?

553
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,240
Who is your daughter?

554
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,520
She?!

555
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,520
I don't like two things in life.

556
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,640
First, tears in her eyes and second,
thermometer in her mouth.

557
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,240
She cried because of you
and that led to high fever 98.3.

558
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,960
Go and apologize to her.

559
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,200
Radio Mirchi!

560
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,280
Don't act smart.

561
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,200
Do as I say.

562
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,840
Apologize to her.

563
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
- Listen.
- Apologize to her.

564
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,640
Apologize.

565
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,760
- What are you doing?
- Come on, say sorry. Go.

566
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,920
Is the guy tough or the lamp post old?

567
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,720
Don't bother, maintain your attitude.

568
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,160
If you budge he'll take advantage.

569
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,480
Hello. Who is it? Gopal's mother?

570
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,280
You know I don't like trouble.
I've come to warn him.

571
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,000
Listen, I'll come home for lunch.

572
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,440
Make fish curry for me.

573
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,760
I'll hang up now.

574
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,080
Have you seen my men?

575
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,120
They are regular at the
gym for the last 10 years.

576
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,080
They eat an entire chicken daily.

577
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,600
You don't need chicken
or eggs to thrash someone.

578
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,680
Courage can make anything happen.

579
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,280
I swear on Gopal's mother.

580
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,280
I didn't run after her.

581
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
I slapped her very hard.

582
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,600
You said that he was after you.

583
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
But he is saying he slapped you hard.

584
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,640
How will I solve the case?

585
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,920
Why will he slap me?

586
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,800
He was after me.

587
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,400
It's not a matter to discuss.

588
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,640
Just go and thrash him.

589
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,280
Yes! No, if we thrash him he might slap.

590
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,800
- Oh yes! Just ask him to say sorry.
- Okay.

591
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,280
- Will apologizing be enough?
- Yes.

592
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,040
Okay.

593
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,640
Leave the rest to me.

594
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,880
Don't feel that a crooked
lamp post can scare us.

595
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,440
Resolve the matter. Go and apologize.

596
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,960
Oh my child! Have cold drinks.

597
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,680
Did he call me a child?

598
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,280
Can you hear me?

599
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,680
- Look...
- I love you.

600
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,240
You are crossing the limits.

601
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,520
I'll inform brother now.

602
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,320
I'll say 'I love you'
to you before your brother.

603
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,760
Just wait and watch
what's going to happen.

604
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,720
Principal!

605
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,480
Mr. Roy, you are here?

606
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,400
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

607
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,600
I was on my way to the airport
so thought of meeting Rai.

608
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,160
- Okay.
- Is everything fine?

609
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,320
I was... brother!

610
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,960
Brother! Brother.

611
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,840
I've got her.

612
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,640
I had told you I will say
'I love you' to you before everyone.

613
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,320
You had asked me to
propose before your brother.

614
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,880
Not just your brother but I'm
proposing to you before entire Benaras...

615
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
...I love you.

616
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,640
I love you Binodini Dhali.

617
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,560
She isn't Binodini Dhali. She is Rai.

618
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,520
Is it?

619
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,760
Shyamal, I'm in soup here.

620
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
The girl with whom I dated
on facebook and thought...

621
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,280
...her to be Binodini Dhali is actually--

622
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,560
- What's your name?
- Rai.

623
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,800
Yes, Rai.

624
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,800
Yes, brother.

625
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,640
You proposed to her without even
confirming if she is Binodini Dhali.

626
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,320
I thought him to be
foolish but he is smart.

627
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,080
Facebook love, brother.

628
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,840
These girls put up pictures
of beautiful girls in their profiles.

629
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,440
This leads to confusion.

630
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,720
Till now I loved her but
now I'm going to teach her a lesson.

631
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,040
You are a decent man
so you didn't say anything.

632
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,440
Anyone else in your place
would've thrashed me badly.

633
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,640
I'll leave now, brother.

634
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,080
Please check who else has
used your photo in their profiles.

635
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,120
Otherwise someone else
might come and propose you.

636
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,880
Goodbye.

637
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,600
Thank you.

638
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,520
How was it?

639
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,440
I saw it.

640
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,560
You act very smart but you
lost your smartness before brother.

641
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,040
You were behaving so meekly.

642
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,360
This is real action.

643
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,960
I had to face lot of trouble
in my previous life too for you.

644
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,720
He is talking of past life again. Oh god!

645
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,080
Don't you remember?

646
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,640
In my past life I used to
roam around with a flute in my hands.

647
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,200
Sometimes we played Holi
and sometimes games of love.

648
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,760
You were very understanding.
You came running whenever I sent signals.

649
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,000
You might give any reference
but you can't convince me so easily.

650
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,360
You don't know that
you are already convinced.

651
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,880
Oh! Is it? - Yes.
- Wow! Wonderful! And I don't even know.

652
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,880
- Prove it.
- Prove it?

653
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,280
Just spend an entire
day with me and then...

654
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,760
...you'll see yourself
falling in love with me.

655
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,640
Love?!

656
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,400
You are scared of actually
falling in love. Right?

657
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,640
Tomorrow is yours.

658
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,680
Hail Lord Shiva!

659
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,200
Perfect!

660
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,840
Why did you ask him to come here?

661
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,960
- He has challenged me.
- Challenge?

662
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,240
If I spend a day with
him I'll fall in love with him.

663
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,600
Love?!

664
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,360
I'm planning to send him
to hospital for at least one week.

665
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,880
What will you do?

666
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,760
Look over there.

667
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,120
Do you remember the scene
from 'Chennai Express' in which...

668
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,160
...Shah Rukh carries Deepika
and climbs the stairs of temple?

669
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,160
Yes.

670
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,200
Will you carry him up so many stairs?

671
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Oh no! Why will I carry him?
He'll carry me.

672
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,000
How will it help? He'll enjoy it.

673
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,280
Stupid! This is not a film
and he is not Shah Rukh Khan.

674
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,160
He might reach heaven
if he carries me up the stairs.

675
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,520
He is coming.

676
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,600
- Hi!
- Hi!

677
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,760
Why have you called me here?

678
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,160
I come here on every full moon.

679
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,040
So, I thought of starting from here.

680
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,680
Wow! So, you want to begin
our journey by seeking god's blessings.

681
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,360
- Yes.
- Fantastic! Let's go.

682
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,320
Let's go.

683
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,760
What's wrong?

684
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,120
I've slipped.
It seems I've sprained my ankle.

685
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,480
I can't even walk.

686
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,000
So, let's not do it today.

687
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,160
Look we met with an obstacle
right in the beginning.

688
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,680
I don't know what future
has in store for us.

689
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,360
Why are you staring at me?

690
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,560
I hope you are not thinking
of carrying me in your arms.

691
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,320
Exactly! I was thinking the same.

692
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,040
I told you that we share a connection...

693
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,640
...else why will we meet here
in Benaras instead of in Kolkata.

694
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,240
Come on.

695
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,320
The temple is high up there.
I hope you won't put me down midway.

696
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,440
It'll indicate the
end of our love right now.

697
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,280
I've fallen in love and I'll honor it.

698
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,640
Come on. Come on. Get up slowly.

699
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,760
What happened?

700
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,920
- What's your weight?
- Well, it's 40.

701
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,840
She is lying in front of the temple.

702
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,240
Don't you trust me?

703
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,560
No, I feel you are 350 grams lesser.

704
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,720
Shall I start?

705
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,960
Oh God!

706
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,640
You've climbed so many steps
with your wife in arms to offer prayers.

707
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,920
It isn't possible without love.
God bless you.

708
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,280
Be blessed.

709
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,720
" I don't know your name."

710
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,600
"I don't know if it's night or morning."

711
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,160
"My heart just conveys love to me."

712
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,960
"Come and row with me."

713
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,800
"Come and spend days with me."

714
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,200
"My heart won't go
back without you today."

715
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,640
"I can place thousands bets if you wish."

716
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,280
"I'm ready to die for you."

717
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,400
"I can place thousands bets if you wish."

718
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,240
"I'm ready to die for you."

719
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,600
"Come and support me,
come and give me light."

720
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,280
"I can't live alone anymore."

721
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,920
"Give me a solution."

722
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,480
"I can place thousands bets if you wish."

723
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,680
"I'm ready to die for you."

724
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,120
"Unknowingly it has come in my life."

725
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:50,240
"Let me understand the feelings of heart."

726
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:55,640
"Unknowingly it has come in my life."

727
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,800
"Let me understand the feelings of heart."

728
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,680
"What else shall I tell you?"

729
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,120
"The flowers are saying..."

730
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,560
"You are mine."

731
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,920
"What other reason do you need?"

732
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,240
"The breeze is saying..."

733
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,240
"You are mine."

734
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:26,280
"I can place thousands bets if you wish."

735
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:33,120
"I'm ready to die for you."

736
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,880
"Whenever heart has troubled me..."

737
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,880
"...I didn't leave any stone unturned."

738
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,800
"Whenever heart has troubled me..."

739
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,920
"...I didn't leave any stone unturned."

740
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,360
"What else shall I tell you?"

741
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,600
"The flowers are saying..."

742
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,640
"...You are mine."

743
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,080
"What other reason do you need?"

744
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,640
"The breeze is saying..."

745
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,320
"...You are mine."

746
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,280
"I can place thousands bets if you wish."

747
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,600
"I'm ready to die for you."

748
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,920
"I can place thousands bets if you wish."

749
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,840
"I'm ready to die for you."

750
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,000
Rai.

751
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,280
The time you had given me is over.

752
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,440
In this given time
I never felt you love me.

753
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,840
According to my condition
I'll never come before you again.

754
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,360
It seems someone has jumped
over the wall and entered the house.

755
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,160
Yes Kanaida. It might be a thief.

756
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,200
Let's go and check.

757
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,640
He has come to steal flowers.

758
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,280
Hey! You?!

759
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,600
No one dares to look at
this house during daytime and...

760
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,600
...you've entered the house at midnight.

761
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,760
What's the matter?

762
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,240
What can I do?

763
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,680
- Rai madam is ragging.
- Ragging?

764
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,080
Rai madam has asked me to
jump over the wall at midnight...

765
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,360
...steal flower and then
give the flower to her.

766
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,680
Look I'm in trouble.

767
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,000
Please help me.

768
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,360
Try to hassle her.

769
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,040
You've stolen the flower
now jump and go upstairs.

770
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,760
Kanaida, it's very high.
How will I climb up?

771
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,320
My boys will push you up.

772
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,320
Go quickly. If she falls asleep
you'll have to wait till morning.

773
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,400
Good idea!

774
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,840
Gopal's mother, Rai is ragging a boy.

775
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,760
He has to climb up to give a rose to Rai.
Just imagine.

776
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,240
I'll come home for dinner
as soon as he climbs up.

777
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,520
Make scrambled eggs for me.
I'll have it with liquor.

778
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,200
Kanaida, this is very tough.
Can I use the stairs?

779
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,240
Then you can't be Spiderman.

780
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,880
No, I didn't tell you.
You can't be Spiderman.

781
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,360
If you delay I'll use a
bamboo to push you up. Hurry up!

782
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,640
- Hi!
- Hi!

783
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,120
Adi, you?!
You are here? Has anyone seen you?

784
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,000
- I mean Kanaida...
- Kanaida?!

785
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,160
Are you mad?

786
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,520
Just watch.

787
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,400
Kanaida! Kanaida!

788
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,200
What's wrong now?

789
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,320
- I've dropped the flower.
- Fool! Look for the flower.

790
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,200
- Where?
- It's here.

791
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,400
- Here.
- Throw it up. Please.

792
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,560
Anything.

793
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
Thank you.

794
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,720
Look at the way he caught it.

795
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,320
Did you see how they helped me?

796
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,640
How did you manage them?

797
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:40,600
I told them that madam Rai is ragging me.

798
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,160
Ragging?! You?!

799
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,120
Why didn't you reply to my message?

800
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:52,040
I thought of meeting instead
of replying to the message.

801
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,720
It's any day a better option. Isn't it?

802
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,400
But Adi, you'll be in trouble
if brother gets to know this.

803
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,880
You don't know him.

804
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,560
You don't know me.

805
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:09,360
When someone is in love
its love and not fear in heart.

806
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,800
By the way, are you scared?

807
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,320
You don't know me.

808
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,920
When someone is in love
its love and not fear in heart.

809
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,840
Wow! I had told you we
have a past life connection.

810
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,800
"If I remember you."

811
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,680
Oh no, the guy has called me again.

812
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,720
Big brother, the scoundrel
is continuously disconnecting the call.

813
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,920
Keep trying. I want him.

814
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,040
I would've switched off the
phone but I've to call my wife.

815
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,400
Let me teach him a lesson.

816
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,760
Big brother, I'm in trouble.
Please help me.

817
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,480
You are very close to me now.

818
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,880
What's the matter?

819
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:14,640
I'm getting life threatening
calls from a man continuously.

820
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,000
- You too have a phone problem.
- What are you saying?

821
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,640
Call him, I'll speak to him.

822
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,200
No, that won't work.
I've said a lot to him.

823
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,960
But, he won't listen.
He is calling me continuously.

824
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,560
- He is shameless fellow.
- What do you want?

825
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,280
We need to scare him.

826
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,440
Scare him.
Tell him you are going to stab him.

827
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,160
You are going to burn him to death.

828
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,960
- Speak as if you are a serial killer.
- Call him.

829
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,680
- Call him.
- Yes.

830
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,000
There is signal problem at times of need.

831
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,760
- Go there and call. Hey!
- Yes.

832
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,320
Big brother, the number is unreachable.

833
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,800
Try again.

834
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,400
Big brother, he has received the call.

835
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,880
Hey scoundrel, where are you?

836
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,360
Hey you, don't shout!
Don't play hide and seek anymore.

837
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,160
Let's face each other.

838
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,840
I've finalized men to kill you.

839
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,680
I'll chop you and your
men into pieces and burn you.

840
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Where are you?

841
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,040
Oh no! You are so eager to die.

842
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,560
Come and face me if you have the courage.

843
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,080
I'll bury you here.

844
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,120
Dogs bark but the caravan goes on.

845
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,720
What are you blabbering?
You don't have to come. I'll come.

846
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,000
Where are you?

847
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,560
I'm in a roadside inn
on the highway to Gaya.

848
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,200
Which roadside inn? Which roadside inn?

849
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,760
Ramdevji Highway Hotel.

850
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,680
It means you are within my reach.

851
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,880
I too am here.

852
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,440
I'll kill you and perform
the last rites here.

853
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,800
Mehboob, he is here, go and look for him.

854
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,640
- He is talking on phone. Find him.
- Look over there.

855
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,720
Where are you?

856
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,040
Scoundrel! Give me the phone.

857
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,040
Get going.

858
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,920
I'm behind the hotel.

859
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,480
Where are you? Where are you?

860
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,080
- Big brother!
- Hey!

861
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,240
- Big brother! Big brother!
- Hey, look there.

862
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,840
Nepal Das is the man on phone. Come on.

863
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,360
Big brother, I'm your pet dog.
I'm your pet dog.

864
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,400
Who is the boy? Where is he?

865
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,760
I don't know. I don't know.

866
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,760
But, I know where his father lives.

867
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,760
I'm well acquainted with him.

868
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,200
If you wish I can convince
him to come before you.

869
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,480
Hello. What are you saying?

870
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,760
I'm coming. I'm coming.

871
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,160
- Mehboob!
- Yes big brother.

872
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,400
We've to go to Benaras.

873
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,800
Send him to Kolkata. Send him back.

874
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,200
- Come on. Come on.
- Leave me.

875
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,960
- Hi!
- Hi! Nice to meet you.

876
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,880
- Fine. He is Mr. Tripathi.
- Nice to meet you.

877
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,160
Pleasure.

878
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,560
Sir, we've done many projects in Mumbai.

879
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,320
Now we want to establish in Benaras.

880
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,920
Nice. Interesting.

881
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,880
- For that we need your support, sir.
- Okay.

882
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,640
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

883
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,880
Adi!

884
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,640
Who is the guy?

885
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,920
He is a college student.

886
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,200
Rai meets him every day.

887
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,760
He is roaming around
with Rai since yesterday.

888
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,200
She didn't get down even for a while.

889
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,160
Do you know how many
types of ragging are there?

890
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,400
Rai goes on bike ride with him.

891
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,880
This isn't ragging but
something else. Kill him.

892
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,880
Else I'll kill all of you. Got it?

893
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,880
I swear on Gopal's mother
that either I'll kill him or...

894
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,400
...I won't show my face to you.

895
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,560
This is for you. Come.

896
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,440
What if brother gets to know
we are roaming around in bike?

897
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,000
What else? We'll sing loudly..."We'll
love each other openly."

898
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,680
Go after them.

899
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:34,960
Rai!

900
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,520
Kanaida is following us.
Ride faster, please ride faster.

901
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,000
Hold on to me tightly
and see how fast I can ride.

902
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,960
Rai! Rai!

903
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:57,600
Faster. Faster. Faster.

904
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,360
They are there.

905
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,520
Oh no! You can even ride a car properly.

906
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,120
You've hit the pole.

907
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,600
Adi, what if Kanaida
informs brother about us?

908
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,720
What else? We'll sing... "I've
done the right thing by falling in love."

909
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,680
"I'll love."

910
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,000
You always joke.

911
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,760
Why do you worry?
One day everyone will know. Come.

912
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,480
Don't you remember
the troubles of past life?

913
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,280
- Did anyone succeed?
- Again?!

914
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,520
Sit, I'll get coffee.

915
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,320
Hey, get her.

916
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,880
You've no relation with her.

917
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,160
Why are you bothered
if I've an affair with her?

918
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,640
If you are so bothered come,
I'll teach you a lesson.

919
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,120
You want to kill my dear sister.

920
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,440
Big brother!

921
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,160
Come. Let's go.

922
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,240
Dibakar Roy's men have
taken your father away.

923
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,400
I had left her with you
in Benaras so that she is safe.

924
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,280
You don't even know who is in
love with her and who wants to kill her.

925
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,640
Big brother,
I didn't know that Raghav Sinha will...

926
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,320
...befriend Shankar to
kill Rai after such a long time.

927
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,720
You should've given it a thought.

928
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,560
Raghav Sinha is not a
saint who'll forget everything.

929
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,400
He still believes that I'm
responsible for his sister's death.

930
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,880
There is more bad news.

931
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,680
Shruti has eloped with
a guy on her wedding day.

932
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,000
What?!

933
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,000
Sister has eloped?

934
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,200
She is walking on the same path.

935
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,800
But brother...

936
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,440
- Deba.
- Yes, brother.

937
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,200
I'm not bothered if she
wants to forget or remember...

938
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,920
...the person she loves
throughout her life.

939
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:15,400
- I have a problem if the guy is alive.
- Brother!

940
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,840
If I go and tell them
that the boy fooled us then...

941
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,600
...they are not going to spare us.

942
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,520
No need to sacrifice
your life for someone else.

943
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,360
Let's go and tell them
that we've killed the boy. Wait.

944
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,640
- Can I do it?
- Yes brother.

945
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,240
Younger brother!

946
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,200
What's the matter? Why are you so excited?

947
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,200
I've killed the boy.

948
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:59,440
- Great! Here is your reward.
- For me?

949
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,000
Big brother need not worry about the boy.
He's dead.

950
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:08,320
Big brother is not worried
about him but someone else.

951
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,440
Is there someone else?

952
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,240
The person who hired
murderers to kill Rai.

953
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,800
Kolkata's Raghav Sinha.

954
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,720
Someone amongst you've leaked
the news of the murder plan...

955
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,560
...of Dibakar's sister.

956
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:36,760
It's better if he confesses else
his name will appear on the phone...

957
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,800
...in a minute.

958
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,680
You've just one minute in hand.

959
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:49,120
I'll forgive if you confess
else you'll be killed.

960
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,840
Hey! The work has been done. Hang up.

961
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:11,760
Sir, I've made a mistake.

962
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,160
Forgive me.

963
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,400
I won't do anything like this again.

964
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:22,560
I know that my men can kill or die for me.

965
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,960
Come on kill yourself.

966
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,400
I told you to kill yourself
but you tried to kill your father.

967
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:46,720
If you target wrong people
the pistol doesn't work.

968
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,200
Take this. Don't delay, kill yourself.

969
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,680
Shoot.

970
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,720
Sir, Dibakar has come
to Kolkata with his sister.

971
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,640
When death approaches
people go to their home.

972
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,600
That's why I missed the first chance.

973
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,840
Everything fine?

974
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,680
I stay in Kalighat temple during
daytime and return home at night.

975
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,320
You eloped with Dibakar's
elder sister from Kolkata.

976
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:41,000
Now you are back to Kolkata
to marry the younger sister.

977
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:46,200
Tell me something. Why are
you attracted to Dibakar's sisters?

978
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,960
The girl I got attracted to
turned out to be Dibakar's sister.

979
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,160
Dibakar's men are searching you.

980
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,760
If they get you they'll kill you.

981
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,880
If he gets to know that you
are in love with his younger sister...

982
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,400
...then he'll burn your corpse.

983
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:06,000
Don't worry. I convinced his
sister and now I'll convince him.

984
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,360
- If he is not convinced?
- I'll teach him a lesson.

985
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,440
- Everything is...
- Fair and lovely.

986
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,160
Great!

987
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,840
Don't stare at me like this.

988
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,400
I'm diabetic and I can't control myself.

989
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,080
I've got nature's call now.

990
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,320
- What's your name?
- Prabhachan.

991
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,920
You can call me Prabhu (lord).

992
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,840
He is everyone's Prabhu.
Why shall he call you Prabhu?

993
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,080
Does a donkey call it's
master 'Prabhu' or vice versa?

994
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,680
- What did you say?
- Was making him understand.

995
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,040
- What do you do?
- I play cards.

996
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,160
You are joking with me?

997
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,840
Seriously sir, playing cards earns money.

998
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,640
I've built the first floor
with money earned from gambling.

999
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,000
Sit with me some day and I'll
be able to build the second floor.

1000
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,120
Where is your son?

1001
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,840
I've heard that he has eloped with a girl.

1002
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,160
I don't know anything else.

1003
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,720
You still have time to speak the truth.

1004
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,120
You are at my aim.

1005
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,600
Don't scare me,
I control the pressure anymore.

1006
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,760
We are speaking the truth, we don't know.

1007
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,760
I was saying that...

1008
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,400
Today is the rice eating ceremony
of the minister's grandchild.

1009
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,840
We have to go there.

1010
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,040
- Take out the car.
- Okay, brother.

1011
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,720
You'll stay here until I get your son.

1012
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:40,520
The washroom is over there.

1013
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,880
It's dry now;
I don't need to go to washroom now.

1014
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,240
- Welcome.
- Thank you. My sister.

1015
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,680
Excuse me. Carry on, I'll join you soon.

1016
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

1017
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,000
Please come.

1018
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,040
Mehboob...

1019
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,040
Yes.

1020
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,560
...keep an eye on Raghav's men.

1021
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,520
They won't be spared
if they do anything here.

1022
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,720
I'll kill everyone.

1023
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,760
Juice, madam.

1024
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,320
- Juice, madam.
- No, thanks.

1025
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,800
Drink it. Free fruit juice.
It'll be your loss if you don't drink it.

1026
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,480
I never thought that
I will meet you again.

1027
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,440
This isn't a kite that'll get
lost in the sky after it is severed.

1028
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,280
This is love, madam. Love.

1029
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:36,800
Adi knows very well
how to keep his love afloat.

1030
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:50,800
Who were the people
who attacked you in Benaras?

1031
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,080
Have you heard of
industrialist Raghav Sinha?

1032
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,480
Yes, I've seen him here.

1033
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,160
- He had sent men to kill me.
- Why?

1034
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,760
Our enmity with Raghav
Sinha's family is an old one.

1035
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,840
Raghav Sinha's sister
Sunanda loved my brother.

1036
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,560
It was one-sided love.

1037
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,360
Brother refused her proposal
several times yet...

1038
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,840
...Sunanda came to our
house with her brother one day.

1039
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,240
I believed that the enmity
between us will continue for...

1040
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,600
...few more generations.

1041
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,040
But, Sunanda loves you.

1042
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,600
So, I've come here
with the marriage proposal.

1043
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,280
Raghav, I've already refused her.

1044
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,720
This is just waste of time.

1045
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,520
- Dibakar!
- Don't shout! The kids are here.

1046
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,960
They are my world.

1047
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,640
There is no place for
anyone else in my life.

1048
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,200
I tried to reason with you
then why aren't you backing off?

1049
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,280
Sunanda!

1050
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:57,960
Dibakar, I'll teach you a lesson.

1051
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,240
Raghav! Raghav!

1052
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,640
Dibakar, I won't spare your sisters.

1053
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:22,560
Brother didn't marry and
brought us up as his daughters.

1054
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,920
Sister didn't think twice before
eloping with a guy on her wedding.

1055
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,440
Brother is angry at the
boy with whom sister eloped.

1056
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,760
Shall I tell you a truth?

1057
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:51,560
You?! If brother gets to
know that you are the boy who...

1058
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:57,240
...helped sister run away then
he'll never accept our relationship.

1059
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,600
It isn't possible to go against brother.

1060
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,000
I'm not asking you to do so.

1061
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,760
What you are doing as
a sister is 100% correct and...

1062
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:14,840
...what I'm doing in
your love is "100% love."

1063
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,240
- "100% love."
- Adi.

1064
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:27,520
Big brother.
Big brother, he is Tab Shashtri.

1065
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,480
You didn't call me during
your first sister's marriage.

1066
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,440
The day was not auspicious for a wedding.

1067
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,160
All the weddings on
that day were cancelled.

1068
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,720
Look, look here.

1069
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,560
In some cases storm had
destroyed the decorations.

1070
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,480
In another case the tyre
of the groom's car got punctured.

1071
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,160
Find out an auspicious date
where such things won't happen.

1072
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,680
Yes, I will.

1073
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,320
- There is an auspicious date.
- Is it?

1074
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,680
There is a black mark on it too.

1075
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,400
Black mark? What?

1076
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:02,800
This house.

1077
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,960
- What's wrong in it?
- It's vastu.

1078
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,080
It isn't right.

1079
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,680
If a wedding takes place
from this house then...

1080
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,920
...you'll be rendered homeless.

1081
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,280
The marriage won't last.

1082
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,520
Why? What's wrong?

1083
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,200
The door is in the wrong direction.

1084
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:23,880
The door should be in the west
so that western winds can come in.

1085
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,800
Look, the door is in the north.

1086
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,280
The sunlight is falling directly
on your stomach and upsetting it.

1087
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,160
Upset stomach causes bad temper.

1088
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:37,440
- What's your sister's name?
- Rai. Rai.

1089
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,960
It means Radha.

1090
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,920
She is supposed to fall in love. Has she?

1091
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,640
It happens at this age.

1092
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,760
Don't blame her age.

1093
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,200
- Vastu.
- Yes.

1094
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,240
You need to change your house.

1095
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:02,240
Your house must be in elevated land.

1096
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,720
How will I know?

1097
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,720
I'll explain it to you.

1098
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,320
There will be a beautiful
garden in front of the house.

1099
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,200
Beautiful garden.

1100
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,960
- A big door.
- A big door.

1101
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,240
As you enter the house
the way to upstairs is on left.

1102
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,400
- Way to upstairs is on left.
- No, no.

1103
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,280
No. No.

1104
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,040
- On the right.
- On the right.

1105
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,320
- The stairs to go up.
- The stairs to go up.

1106
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,800
Big brother,
Tab Shashtri is very renowned.

1107
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,280
I've experienced that whatever
he says after looking into his tab...

1108
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,200
...matches very well.

1109
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,520
Brother, look for the ideal house.

1110
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,200
I'll pay as much as you want.

1111
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,840
Buying a tab for you
has proved to be fruitful.

1112
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,280
If I didn't take the tab with
me then I wouldn't have been tensed now.

1113
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,480
Why are you so tensed?

1114
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,960
Haven't you ever lied before?

1115
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,200
Lying to others and
Dibakar Roy is not the same.

1116
01:20:53,840 --> 01:21:00,160
If he finds out I fooled
him then he'll behead me.

1117
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,760
Why are you so worried, Tab da?

1118
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,600
You just step in their
new house on Ram Navami.

1119
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,760
Then you'll see what love is.

1120
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:09,880
Everything is fair and lovely.

1121
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,480
Prabhu, what are you thinking?

1122
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,320
Don't you know where
your son is right now?

1123
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,080
I would've revealed it if I knew.

1124
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,640
I'm not a father who'll
sacrifice his life for his son.

1125
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,400
Oh no! This is disgusting.

1126
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,360
I haven't talked to my wife for two days.

1127
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,200
- I'm feeling wife sick.
- You are right.

1128
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,560
Find out some clue.

1129
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,320
I've erased all the clues.

1130
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,000
The moment I came to know
that my son has eloped with...

1131
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,360
...Dibakar Roy's sister, I've
burnt his clothes, shoes, undergarments...

1132
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,320
...Voter card, ration card, everything.

1133
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,400
So that no one gets
to know I'm his father.

1134
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,720
- Such a dangerous father.
- Hey!

1135
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,440
- I've a great plan.
- Share it.

1136
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,720
Look at this.

1137
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:59,200
Show it to him and
tell him he is your son.

1138
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:03,080
He'll be happy to get
the photo and will release us.

1139
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,560
Whose photo is this?

1140
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,160
This is my father's young age photo.

1141
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:17,240
Nepal, you were definitely
my brother in my past life.

1142
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:22,640
If your plan works and
we get released then we'll party.

1143
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,720
Big brother,
latest product sent from Bangkok by Joe.

1144
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:41,440
Don't worry, he is not that smart.
Be confident.

1145
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,560
- Big brother.
- What's the matter?

1146
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,080
Both the jewels are together?

1147
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,440
- He is addressing me as jewel.
- Me too.

1148
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,080
- I had something to say.
- Yes, tell me.

1149
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,800
A two days stay in your house
has made me sympathetic to your worries.

1150
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,080
- My son has committed a mistake.
- He is a fool.

1151
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:00,680
I'll give you his photo
so that you can get hold of him.

1152
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,280
Here is my son's photo.

1153
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:13,560
How strange! Your son looks like him.

1154
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:21,040
How can we look same?
We are not the same person.

1155
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,400
- He is his son.
- Yes, my son.

1156
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,320
Really?!

1157
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,800
- Then go.
- Let's go.

1158
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,920
- No, I won't go.
- Why?

1159
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,960
You've taken such good care
of us that we don't wish to leave you.

1160
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,240
I want to stay here.

1161
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:40,080
You fool! If you like a film will
you stay in the theatre after it ends?

1162
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:40,840
Come on.

1163
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:46,040
My heart has softened
after seeing this photo.

1164
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,000
So, I will let you go.

1165
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,520
He heard us.

1166
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:52,720
Shall we go downstairs?

1167
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,320
Take the photo with you.

1168
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,200
Big brother,
we've found the house in Kalighat.

1169
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,840
Tab Shashtri has said
that today is Ram Navami.

1170
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,000
It'll be auspicious if
we enter the house this evening.

1171
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,640
- Tel him we are coming.
- Okay, big brother.

1172
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,000
Come.

1173
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,880
Welcome, sir. Welcome.

1174
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,040
What's going on?

1175
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,320
It's Ram Navami and we didn't
get any lady to play the conch shell.

1176
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,960
So, the boys are playing it. Don't worry.

1177
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,760
Mehboob, who is he?

1178
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,280
He is the owner of this house.

1179
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,280
He'll stay in this house.

1180
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,760
That's the agreement they've
reached with Tab Shashtri.

1181
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,080
- Shall we go in?
- Please come in, sir. Come.

1182
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,280
Get the luggage.

1183
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,880
- You?!
- Welcome, madam.

1184
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,320
Is this your house? - No, my father's.

1185
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,640
Where have you brought us? Come on.

1186
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,760
Welcome. Welcome.

1187
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:04,520
He appears to be someone familiar.

1188
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,640
I feel he has hugged me before.

1189
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,200
You are lamp post, I had climbed
up on you to get the kite down.

1190
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,080
Come in.

1191
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,440
- Come on.
- Okay.

1192
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,200
Just a minute.

1193
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:20,880
Step in with your left leg.

1194
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,400
- Brother, isn't the house good?
- Very good.

1195
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:30,800
But the stairs?

1196
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:32,960
- Tab Shastri has checked everything.
- Fine.

1197
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,560
Come on. Come on.

1198
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,880
- The house is very beautiful.
- Thank you, sir.

1199
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,320
Sir, my father has made this house.

1200
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,840
My mother has decorated
it with her own hands.

1201
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,440
Wherever you look everything
is fair and lovely.

1202
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,960
The voice too sounds familiar.

1203
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,760
You are very strange, sir.

1204
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,880
Earlier you said my hug
seemed familiar and now...

1205
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,720
...you are saying
my voice sounds familiar.

1206
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,360
If you see my face you'll
say it too seems familiar.

1207
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,040
Why have you tied your father's eyes?

1208
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,560
- He is talking nonsense.
- You think he is my father?

1209
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,760
I'm looking for his son.

1210
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,520
If I get him I'll slit his throat.

1211
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,480
Don't say such ominous
things in the new house.

1212
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,040
I've offered prayers,
come have take oblation.

1213
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:06,800
Sure.

1214
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,800
Lock them up in a room.

1215
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,080
Keep the luggage inside.

1216
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,600
Come. Come.

1217
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,760
A power cut just as we
stepped in the house? Oh no!

1218
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,360
Where are they?

1219
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,320
What happened?

1220
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,720
Let's run away.

1221
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,640
How can we run away?

1222
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:27,880
We didn't see the main
door while coming in.

1223
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:32,480
I feel we can.
The floor appears to be familiar. Come.

1224
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,440
Where are we?

1225
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,320
Look, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road.

1226
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,120
It means I'm near my house.

1227
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,000
Good. You go to your house.

1228
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,640
I'll take the underground
metro and go to Garia.

1229
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,720
How will you get metro at this hour?

1230
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,800
Spend the night at my
house and go tomorrow morning.

1231
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,840
I'll treat you to spicy
mutton and roti from Montu's shop.

1232
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,560
Deepika and Shah Rukh had it
when they came to Kalighat for a shoot.

1233
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,520
- Really?! Great!
- Auto!

1234
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,400
- Take this.
- What's this?

1235
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,560
Night dress.

1236
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:18,800
Thank you. Thank you.

1237
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:22,240
Nepu, just imagine what
Dibakar must be feeling when...

1238
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,560
...he finds us missing.

1239
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,120
I know him very well.

1240
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,680
He can't stop his sister.
How can he stop us?

1241
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:36,440
Nepu, our pair is just like
Jai and Veru from 'Sholay'. A hit one.

1242
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,720
Power has been restored.

1243
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,920
Let's go and buy mutton
and roti from Montu's shop first.

1244
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,160
Look!

1245
01:27:54,840 --> 01:28:00,520
Prabhu, you brought me to
death house instead of your house.

1246
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,320
That's what I see.

1247
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,800
My night dress in someone else's house.

1248
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,480
I fail to understand this.

1249
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,320
Everything is confusing.

1250
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,320
We had gone to buy candles.

1251
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:18,600
Oh! Candles?
Does the shops remain open at this hour?

1252
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,200
- We didn't go to a shop.
- We didn't go to a shop.

1253
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,480
We went to Kalighat temple.

1254
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,440
Many people put candles there.

1255
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,640
We picked candlels from there.

1256
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,240
Did you go to pick up candles
or a boy whom you can...

1257
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,240
...pass on off his son?

1258
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:35,560
Are you crazy?
I showed you a photo and you caught us.

1259
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,400
If we show him your son
then you'll conduct DNA test.

1260
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,880
What happened?

1261
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:51,200
Big brother, now if I tell
you that he is his son then...

1262
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,600
...what will you do?

1263
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,240
I'll sit his throat.

1264
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,280
Otherwise I'll tie you to a
electric pole and give you a shock...

1265
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,840
...of 5000 volts.

1266
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,680
- Then forget it.
- Forget it.

1267
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,560
You are a nasty man.
You are making anyone his son.

1268
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,680
If we were father and
son then wouldn't there be...

1269
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,880
...similarities in our looks?

1270
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,960
- Are there any similarities?
- No!

1271
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,920
If you don't believe then
come and see my family photo. Come.

1272
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,880
- Come on.
- Coming.

1273
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,280
Coming.

1274
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:22,200
I don't know what he'll show.

1275
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,640
What can he show? I've burnt everything.

1276
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,560
Come, come and see.

1277
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:32,120
One. Two. Three.

1278
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,040
My grandfather, my father and myself.

1279
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,360
Look, how similar we look.

1280
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,920
Why isn't your mother in the photo?

1281
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,080
- Mother has clicked the snap.
- Yes.

1282
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:48,160
The photo looks like a film poster.

1283
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,080
Is this cinema hall that
you are seeing film's poster here?

1284
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,560
He is going to turn me mad.

1285
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,360
Mehboob, take him to the room.
Lock him up.

1286
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,880
- Come. Come.
- He is planning something.

1287
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,200
Adi! Adi, what's going on?

1288
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,120
I can't make out anything.
I'm totally confused.

1289
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:15,280
Look, I need to tell
my parents that I love you.

1290
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:18,280
That's why I've brought your family here.

1291
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,520
Your brother wants to
take revenge against me and...

1292
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:26,000
...I want to change him so
that he accepts our relationship.

1293
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,200
But Adi, you are not understanding...

1294
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,160
All I understand is your family
members are here just for 10 days.

1295
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:36,560
And you'll stay here permanently.

1296
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,040
Adi, the bathroom geyser is not working.

1297
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,240
I'll be back. Use cold water.

1298
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:18,440
"Your mesmerizing eyes,
I'll be the kohl in it."

1299
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,440
"When the breeze blows
I'll be your scarf."

1300
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:28,720
"Become mine and I'll be yours."

1301
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,680
"Call me once and I'll go several times."

1302
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:38,720
"I'll comply with your naughtiness."

1303
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:43,880
"Become mine and I'll be yours."

1304
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:48,600
"Your mesmerizing eyes,
I'll be the kohl in it."

1305
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:54,840
"When the breeze blows
I'll be your scarf."

1306
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:20,320
"There is darkness in mind."

1307
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:25,600
"There is darkness in mind."

1308
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:31,000
"Come down as night as the city seeps."

1309
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:35,360
"Come down as night as the city seeps."

1310
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:40,240
"Be the sky and I'll be sea."

1311
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:45,480
"Be the waves and I'll be the pebbles."

1312
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:50,360
"Become mine and I'll be yours."

1313
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:55,600
"Call me once and I'll go several times."

1314
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:01,000
"I'll comply with your naughtiness."

1315
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,760
"Hug me with love day and night."

1316
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,440
"Hug me with love day and night."

1317
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,000
"One who has suddenly
come was always there."

1318
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,600
"One who has suddenly
come was always there."

1319
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:46,920
"Your mesmerizing eyes,
I'll be the kohl in it."

1320
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,160
"When the breeze blows
I'll be your scarf."

1321
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:57,000
"Become mine and I'll be yours."

1322
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,200
"Call me once and I'll go several times."

1323
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:07,880
"I'll comply with your naughtiness."

1324
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,760
Will my sister's wedding
take place properly in this house?

1325
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:21,880
Properly? It'll go off so smoothly
that she'll stay back in this house.

1326
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,240
What do you mean?

1327
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,440
Why do you worry?

1328
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,320
She is such a nice girl
and her groom is so nice.

1329
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,800
You are mistaken.

1330
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,400
I'm not the groom, he is the groom.

1331
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,720
Your sister looks like a heroine.

1332
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,600
You are getting her married
to someone who looks like...

1333
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,360
...a junior artist instead
of someone who looks like a hero.

1334
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:48,120
You don't have to
interfere in this matter.

1335
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:51,360
Just select an auspicious
day from with your tab's help.

1336
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:04,520
9th. It's a very auspicious day.
God has blessed the day.

1337
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,320
- 9th.
- 9th.

1338
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:07,880
9th.

1339
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:15,360
Okay. They are communicating
with their eyes.

1340
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,240
Trying to be smart.

1341
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,040
I'll teach you a lesson.

1342
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,640
Big brother, I've confirmed news.

1343
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,680
Raghav Sinha is planning
to kill Rai once again.

1344
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:27,440
We must be very careful until the wedding.

1345
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,360
He attacked outside so he is safe.

1346
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,320
If he tries to do something
here I'll finish off his family.

1347
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:34,080
Okay, brother.

1348
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,560
Hey! Why has he come out?

1349
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:40,320
- Why are you out?
- To help others.

1350
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,080
- What?!
- Yes.

1351
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:48,000
There is someone else who is
trying to disrupt your sister's wedding.

1352
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,880
- What do you mean?
- Prabhu's son.

1353
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:59,880
He who had eloped with your sister
is now eyeing your younger sister.

1354
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:02,200
If you pull clothes
it brings the body with it.

1355
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:03,680
Pulling the ears brings the head with it.

1356
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,360
If you bring in the wife
then you'll get the son.

1357
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,640
Speak clearly else big brother
doesn't understand things.

1358
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,720
Shut up, fool!

1359
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:16,000
Big brother, Prabhu may be
an aged man but he is henpecked.

1360
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:21,440
- If you get his wife and torture her...
- Torture her.

1361
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,320
...then his son will automatically come.

1362
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:27,760
Nepal, you are trying
to get my mother into all this?

1363
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,080
"I like the move it. Move it."

1364
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:37,800
"I like the move it. Move it.
You like to move it."

1365
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,440
""I like the move it. Move it."

1366
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,360
"I like the move it. Move it."

1367
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,720
Nepal da's daughter is so beautiful.

1368
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,720
- Alright girls, enough for today.
- Okay ma'am.

1369
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,920
- Thank you.
- Okay ma'am.

1370
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,640
She isn't Nepal da's
daughter but his wife.

1371
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,800
- Wife?!
- Wife?!

1372
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,320
Fat Nepal has such a beautiful wife.

1373
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,080
It's like a heroine
coming out of a torn poster.

1374
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:07,160
We need to take her along. You all go.

1375
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,120
Excuse me.

1376
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,640
Yes.

1377
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,720
Are you Madhusree Das?

1378
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,520
Well, you can call me Madhu.

1379
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,840
- I had something to tell you.
- Yes, tell me.

1380
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,720
I'm Adi, I'm close to Nepal da.

1381
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:41,520
Nepal da is in danger. You've to help him.

1382
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:42,840
What has happened to my Nepu?

1383
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,560
What do I need to do?

1384
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:48,800
Acting.

1385
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,800
Noting will happen to this country.

1386
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,560
Listen! Where are you?

1387
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,040
You are here.

1388
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,480
I'll call you back.

1389
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,680
My darling!

1390
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,880
I miss you baby.

1391
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,280
Whose baby are you?

1392
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,120
- Mehboob!
- Yes, big brother.

1393
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,320
Who is she?

1394
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,600
She is Prabhu's wife.

1395
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,200
Our men have brought her here.

1396
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,040
You've become so thin.

1397
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,360
You are tickling me.

1398
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:38,920
Who are you?

1399
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,760
- Don't pretend. I know she is your wife.
- Wife?!

1400
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,360
You are trying to fool me.

1401
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,880
You are absolutely right.

1402
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,240
Sometimes I suffer
from temporary memory loss.

1403
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,680
She is my wife, my dear wife.

1404
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,160
Look, he is even smarter than his son.

1405
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:07,040
- Wife, you've become so thin.
- Great!

1406
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,000
There is no flesh on your body just bones.

1407
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,160
Your complexion has also tanned.

1408
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,600
Leave her. Don't touch her.

1409
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,280
Why are you touching her?

1410
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:21,240
Big brother, how can she be his wife?

1411
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,680
Look at her age.

1412
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:25,000
She was born when he got married.

1413
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,120
How can they be husband and wife? Tell me.

1414
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,000
Don't jump like a monkey.

1415
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:31,040
Why isn't it possible, brother?

1416
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,720
She maybe his second wife.

1417
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,440
Right! She is my second wife.

1418
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:39,080
Second wife?!
The son has grown up so much that...

1419
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,960
- ...he eloped with a girl.
- You are right.

1420
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:44,160
How can't it be true?
The son maybe from his first wife.

1421
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,760
You are right.

1422
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,800
It's true, he is from my first wife.

1423
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,760
Yes, he is his first wife's son.

1424
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,440
I liked him a lot when I first met him.

1425
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,680
Who is she talking about?

1426
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,920
- One who has run away.
- About him?

1427
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,320
- Where is he?
- I won't say.

1428
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:06,120
- She won't say.
- She won't say?

1429
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,840
Your husband's first wife's
son has run away with my own sister.

1430
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,240
Where is he?

1431
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:14,640
- I won't say.
- You won't say? You won't say.

1432
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,680
- Who is it?
- Brother, it's me. Don't hit her.

1433
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:21,320
You suggested that I kidnap
and torture his wife to get the truth.

1434
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,760
- I suggested it.
- Yes.

1435
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:25,680
But, but, I didn't see her then.

1436
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,840
I'm in pain after seeing her.

1437
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,040
So much feeling for
someone else's wife. Why?

1438
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:34,840
Oh no!

1439
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,200
Why are you saying wrong dialogues?

1440
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:41,560
I know the script.
Nothing will happen to me. Love you.

1441
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:48,040
Listen, even if you kill
me I won't reveal anything.

1442
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,000
- You won't say anything.
- No.

1443
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:51,120
Then let me kill you.

1444
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,760
Don't do this; your younger
sister's wedding will be spoilt.

1445
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:59,760
- Ask her husband to convince her.
- Yes, right.

1446
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:06,120
Lock both of them in one
room until they speak the truth.

1447
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:10,560
- Thank you.
- Good idea, sir.

1448
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:13,000
Big brother! Big brother,
why do you have to keep them in one room?

1449
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,520
Discussions can take place
while they stay in different rooms too.

1450
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,040
Technology is so advanced today.

1451
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,920
We've Twitter, whatsapp, facebook...

1452
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:19,760
I'm repeating myself again.

1453
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,640
Why are you so bothered
about someone else's wife?

1454
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:22,600
Is she your wife?

1455
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,360
She is everyone's wife. Isn't it?

1456
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,000
Lock them in one room.

1457
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:31,520
How did you find my wife out?

1458
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:39,560
How long can you hide
such a gorgeous wife?

1459
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:43,200
Anyone can find her out.

1460
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,120
You want everything.

1461
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,320
He is an expert in extra marital affairs.

1462
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,840
- Hi!
- Hi, Rai!

1463
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:56,080
I was looking for you.

1464
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:59,080
- What happened?
- I want to express love to you...

1465
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,680
...in this house.

1466
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,520
Someone will see us together.
Please, please, stop it. Leave me.

1467
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:06,160
No one will see.

1468
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,800
Are you mad? What's wrong with you?

1469
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:24,200
Oh god! Leave me, everyone will see us.

1470
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,360
Everyone is here but no one will see us.
That's the fun.

1471
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,800
- Get me down.
- Okay, talk softly.

1472
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,800
- Open your eyes now.
- No!

1473
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,760
Just once. Look.

1474
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,880
- Softly!
- Facial!

1475
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,640
- Hey you!
- Softly!

1476
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,760
What are you doing?

1477
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:52,920
If anyone sees you both
you' be in problem and...

1478
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,200
...we too will be in problem.

1479
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:56,800
How will they see? Their eyes are closed.

1480
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,520
What is this?

1481
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:05,320
Foolish gang!
You've turned a blind eye to everything.

1482
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,840
Open your eyes. The first scene has begun.

1483
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,440
- We don't have time to see it.
- Why?

1484
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,960
Brother Adi has asked
to brighten up our face and...

1485
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,520
...then only we can
get hold of Prabhu's wife.

1486
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,680
Put cucumbers on your eyes too.

1487
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,080
I'll check out what's
going on in the film.

1488
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:22,840
Hi! What's up?

1489
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:00,000
- Take this. It's for you.
- Is it?

1490
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,480
Look at him.

1491
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:19,200
Put the cucumbers back.

1492
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,320
- Rai, where are you going?
- Stop it, Adi.

1493
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,760
- Leave my hand.
- No, I was--

1494
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:37,440
- I was just joking.
- Adi!

1495
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:46,120
What...what is this?

1496
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,840
Look, today is her engagement ceremony.

1497
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,080
Everyone is doing facial.

1498
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,560
I asked her to do facial
but she isn't listening.

1499
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,480
I feel she is not happy with this wedding.

1500
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:12,560
She may or may not agree
but the wedding will take place.

1501
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:24,680
The wedding will definitely take place.

1502
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:58,960
"I slipped in your love
and broke previous record."

1503
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,600
"Let there be a case against me,
I've given you flying kiss."

1504
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:10,000
"I slipped in your love
and broke previous record."

1505
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:13,520
"Let there be a case against me,
I've given you flying kiss."

1506
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:17,280
'I'll shout out in a loudspeaker. Listen!"

1507
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:21,040
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1508
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:24,760
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1509
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,640
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1510
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:31,920
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1511
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:35,600
"I've seen the naughtiness in your eyes."

1512
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:39,200
"I've given my heart to you."

1513
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:42,640
"I'm saying it in your ears. Listen!"

1514
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:46,400
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1515
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:50,280
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1516
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:54,240
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1517
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:58,440
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1518
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,000
"As our eyes met we communicated."

1519
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:19,760
"Our hearts connected strongly."

1520
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,680
"Love erupts in heart
suddenly these days."

1521
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:27,280
"My life has changed after
falling in love with you."

1522
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,560
"As our eyes met we communicated."

1523
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:34,680
"Our hearts connected strongly."

1524
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:38,280
"Love erupts in heart
suddenly these days."

1525
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:42,440
"My life has changed after
falling in love with you."

1526
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:46,160
"I've seen the naughtiness in your eyes."

1527
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:49,880
"I've given my heart to you."

1528
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,440
"I'm saying it in your ears. Listen!"

1529
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:56,200
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1530
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:59,920
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1531
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,680
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1532
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:07,440
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1533
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,800
"When you signal me to come close,
I feel excited."

1534
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:29,440
"My heart has brightened up."

1535
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:33,160
"You stole my heart and
play hide and seek with eyes."

1536
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:36,760
"I run as soon as you ask me to get lost."

1537
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:40,440
"When you signal me to come close,
I feel excited."

1538
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,160
"My heart has brightened up."

1539
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,920
"You stole my heart and
play hide and seek with eyes."

1540
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,640
"I run as soon as you ask me to get lost."

1541
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:55,320
"I slipped in your love
and broke previous record."

1542
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:59,000
"Let there be a case against me,
I've given you flying kiss."

1543
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,280
"I'll shout out in a loudspeaker. Listen!"

1544
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:06,040
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1545
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:09,920
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1546
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,880
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1547
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:18,400
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

1548
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:23,520
- Leave us.
- Leave us.

1549
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:26,240
Look, the engagement
ceremony is going on and...

1550
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,560
...they've locked us in this room.

1551
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,600
What does this mean?

1552
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,000
They feel we'll run away.

1553
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,440
Stop the person who'll spoil the ceremony.

1554
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,480
Yes.

1555
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,400
Look!

1556
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,000
- Hi!
- Hi!

1557
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,680
- Nice dress.
- Thank you.

1558
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,960
- Yours too.
- Thanks.

1559
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:49,480
- It's only for you.
- Me? Thank you.

1560
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,000
Inform me when you are free.

1561
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,760
They are calling me. Coming!

1562
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,800
Take it. He is enjoying himself.
You keep the flower.

1563
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,080
When did I...

1564
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,760
Hope you've no problem.

1565
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:09,280
If you want I can send in cold drinks.

1566
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:12,800
Why have you decked up?

1567
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,920
Who is getting married? That guy or you?

1568
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:19,800
The seat will decide who'll sit on it.

1569
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,640
Madhu!

1570
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:32,120
Hey Nepal da, is everything fine?

1571
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:34,400
Yes, I'm fine and won't
need a doctor in this life.

1572
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:37,800
Adi asked you to go to the kitchen.

1573
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,080
Is Adi calling me?

1574
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,960
Adi went that way.

1575
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,800
Why did you ask her to go to the kitchen?

1576
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,800
That's the signal.

1577
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:50,080
I'll lock the room and
switch off the lights and then--

1578
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:54,960
Hey you! You'll be reborn
as a pumpkin in next life.

1579
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,600
Everyone will chop you into pieces.

1580
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,480
Why are you getting so angry?
Is she your wife?

1581
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,760
It won't help?

1582
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,920
Shall I get a thick rope?

1583
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:12,680
Yes, priest. Put the mark on them.

1584
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,160
Put the ring on him.

1585
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:24,280
Ring.

1586
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,160
Brother!

1587
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:39,440
Sister!

1588
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,480
What are you doing, big brother?

1589
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:58,240
I took care of her for 22 years
and she eloped to marry someone else.

1590
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:59,560
I didn't marry, brother.

1591
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:03,360
Why did you run away then? Why?

1592
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,360
I accept that she made a mistake.

1593
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:08,760
But, she has come back
after realizing her mistake.

1594
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:11,440
Forgive me, brother.

1595
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,280
Should I forgive you?

1596
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:17,400
Give me one reason which
proves that the guy chosen by you...

1597
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,800
...is better than the
boy I chose for you. Tell me.

1598
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:21,200
And then I'll forgive you.

1599
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,040
Why did she elope?

1600
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:27,120
You wanted her to get married
so that she leads a happy life.

1601
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:31,920
She ran away with someone whom
she can love throughout her life.

1602
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:35,720
Love. This is love, big brother.

1603
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:42,200
Her love is not fake.
Her love for that boy and for you.

1604
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:47,360
Big brother, your affection
and love wants to come back to you.

1605
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,800
Don't throw her out. Please.

1606
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:58,560
A sister ties rakhi on a brother
so that he protects her when needed.

1607
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:03,000
So, that he wipes off
her tears and not hurt her.

1608
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,160
Please.

1609
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,280
Hurry up.

1610
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,480
The auspicious time is running out.

1611
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,200
The engagement ceremony
won't take place today.

1612
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:26,560
Come. Come.

1613
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:39,120
Sister, you ran away so that
you don't have to marry Bhaskar.

1614
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:42,520
You came back without marrying
the person you wanted to marry.

1615
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:44,160
Why?

1616
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,200
Why are you laughing?

1617
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:54,040
Who said I didn't marry? Look here.

1618
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,560
Married?! So you are married.

1619
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,400
Congratulations!

1620
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:09,280
Listen, he asked me to lie so
that you don't get married to Bhaskar.

1621
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:10,800
He?

1622
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:12,760
Who is he?

1623
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,440
You?

1624
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:20,640
I separated Shruti from brother.

1625
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:25,400
So, I thought of bringing
Shruti and brother close.

1626
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:28,600
Why did you lie about sister's marriage?

1627
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:34,120
Look, when a child
returns home after failing.

1628
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:36,560
The elders scold him.

1629
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,480
When the same child comes
home crying after failing...

1630
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:43,320
...the same elders console him and say...

1631
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:45,280
...'nothing to worry,
You'll do well next year.'

1632
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,800
Everything is fair and lovely.

1633
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,440
This guy is too smart.

1634
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,080
- You haven't seen anything yet.
- Is it?

1635
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,280
This is just showcase.

1636
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:57,400
He'll extract money from Goddess
Lakshmi's (goddess of weath) box...

1637
01:54:57,480 --> 01:55:00,400
- ...that even she won't get to know.
- Is it?

1638
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,760
I'll stop the drama...

1639
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,680
- ...of this father and son duo.
- Really?!

1640
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,600
- I'll go and tell brother everything.
- Wait!

1641
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:09,360
Why do you want to
stop the drama right now?

1642
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:12,640
Watch out for the next scene.

1643
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:20,040
Son! Son! Son!

1644
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:24,400
Where are you? Son!

1645
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:28,080
Mother! Mother has come.

1646
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:31,800
Mother has come.
Mother has come.

1647
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,840
- Son!
- Mother!

1648
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,520
- Son!
- Mother!

1649
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:38,400
We are meeting after
so many years, mother.

1650
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:39,640
After how many years?

1651
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:41,720
- Mother was in class five then.
- Yes.

1652
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:44,880
How did you see your
mother going to school?

1653
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,280
You don't have to find
out reason in everything.

1654
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:48,040
It's enough if the public understands.

1655
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:50,280
Who is he? Why is he interfering?

1656
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:53,560
He is Nepu.
We've been imprisoned in the same cell.

1657
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:57,200
- My dear!
- My dear!

1658
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,840
What's wrong, baby? I'm here.

1659
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:03,760
Why are you so late?

1660
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:06,760
I was watching a hot movie
on Star Movies last night.

1661
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:07,640
Okay.

1662
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:08,760
That's why I'm late.

1663
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:10,200
Who is she?

1664
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,560
She is my mother.

1665
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:15,160
- Who is she?
- She is his wife.

1666
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,720
If she is Prabhu's wife
then why was did he address...

1667
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,240
...your mother as 'dear'
and go towards her?

1668
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:21,040
A tickling powder should
be applied on you so that...

1669
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,160
...you keep scratching
throughout the night.

1670
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:23,480
You interfere in everything.

1671
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:26,040
- He used endearments for her.
- Is it?

1672
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:28,960
Then why did he spread
out his hands towards her?

1673
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:34,120
He is old so he lost
sense of direction. Fool!

1674
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:37,760
What's the matter? Who is she?

1675
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:40,120
She is my mother.

1676
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:41,880
- Greetings.
- Greetings, brother.

1677
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,480
My mother acts familiar
with anyone see meets.

1678
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,160
If she meets anyone
who is 50 plus in age...

1679
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,640
...she thinks he is my father-in-law.

1680
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:53,680
Mother, he is Rai's big brother.

1681
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,400
- Who is Rai?
- It's me, mother.

1682
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:57,920
It's okay.

1683
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:00,640
They are also like you.

1684
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,680
If they see someone elderly
they treat her as their mother.

1685
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:06,920
We'll stay in your house until
my younger sister gets married.

1686
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:08,800
There is no harm in staying
here after the wedding too.

1687
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:12,080
You've entered my house
and I won't let you go.

1688
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:15,760
Mother! She has already started
treating her as her daughter.

1689
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:18,200
Take her inside.

1690
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,520
I'll come back after
finishing a work. Goodbye.

1691
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:21,880
Come.

1692
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:24,280
Just look at him.

1693
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,480
Let's go.

1694
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,080
This must get over now.

1695
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:35,400
This total thing is just a fake one.

1696
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:39,520
Sir, Dibakar's first sister has come back.

1697
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,240
- How are you, younger brother?
- Good.

1698
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,640
- How are you?
- Great!

1699
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,640
Come on.

1700
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:01,800
Hello, Gopal's mother,
I've reached safely. Yes.

1701
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:04,400
How can I say what's in menu today?

1702
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:07,000
Give me some more. Thank you.

1703
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:10,000
- Rai! How are you?
- Brother!

1704
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:11,640
Big brother, how are you?

1705
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:12,640
What's the matter? Why are you so late?

1706
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:17,360
It's because of Kanaida.
He keeps talking to Gopal's mother.

1707
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:19,200
He is exhausting his balance
and so he is stopping the car.

1708
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:21,280
His balance is exhausting
and he is getting the recharge done.

1709
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,400
That's why we got delayed.

1710
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:23,280
Shall I serve rice?

1711
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:24,400
Yes, I'm very hungry.

1712
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,280
- Don't mind, I'll start eating.
- Not at all. I'll start right now.

1713
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:28,920
- Are you fine?
- Yes.

1714
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,520
Gopal's mother everything
in Kolkata is in pairs just like us.

1715
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:34,440
There are two bridges here
Howrah bridge and Hoogly bridge.

1716
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:36,240
Not googly but Hoogly.

1717
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,840
There are two Kali temples one
in Dakshineswar and one in Kalighat.

1718
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:41,200
There are two crematoriums
one in Keoratala and one in...

1719
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,440
Who is he?

1720
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:43,800
I'll talk later.

1721
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:47,320
- Are you an outsider?
- Benaras.

1722
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,680
- You?
- Nepal.

1723
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:50,680
- Nepali?
- Nepal Das.

1724
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,120
- Yourself?
- Kanai Mondol.

1725
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,440
Every murder in Benaras
is committed by me.

1726
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:55,240
What are you saying?

1727
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:56,520
When did you commit the last one?

1728
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:59,080
I killed the boy who loved Rai last week.

1729
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:00,720
It came out in the Benaras newspaper.

1730
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:05,280
- You mean Dibakar Roy's younger sister?
- Right.

1731
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:06,520
You killed him?

1732
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:07,920
I performed the funeral rites in Gaya too.

1733
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,440
Why did you kill him so early?

1734
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,040
- Look he has taken birth again.
- Where?

1735
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:13,320
There.

1736
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:25,640
- Why is he in our house?
- No. why are you in his house?

1737
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:26,800
Shall I say the reason?

1738
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:35,760
- He'll fool you all and marry Rai.
- Oh no!

1739
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:42,000
If I say this to big brother he
won't believe me because I'm an outsider.

1740
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,520
You are his man,
go and tell him and he'll believe you.

1741
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:45,800
- It isn't possible
- Why?

1742
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:48,880
Younger brother has gifted
me this chain because...

1743
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:50,640
...I killed that boy.

1744
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,720
Oh! Then what can you do?

1745
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:58,520
- Stand here like a lamp post.
- Lamp post?

1746
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,800
The house is really good.

1747
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:02,040
It has been built
according to vastu rules.

1748
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:05,000
Shruti has come back
after coming to this house.

1749
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,880
I'm getting her married to Bhaskar.

1750
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:11,080
Everything is turning out
very well after coming to this house.

1751
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:13,400
Whose house is this?

1752
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:16,960
Aditya's. He is a very good boy.

1753
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:18,920
I've rented the house for 10 days.

1754
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:21,800
Wait, I'll introduce him to you.

1755
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:24,040
Mehboob! Mehboob!

1756
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:27,800
I need to take younger
brother away before Adi enters.

1757
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:28,800
What do I do?

1758
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,160
Sim 2!

1759
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,200
Younger brother doesn't know this number.

1760
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,600
- The cottage cheese dish is tasty.
- Hello.

1761
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,120
- Income tax.
- What?!

1762
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:38,000
Big brother, excuse me.

1763
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:44,920
Tomorrow morning your office,
house and guest house...

1764
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,760
...will be raided at the same time.

1765
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,760
- Who are you?
- Your well-wisher.

1766
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,640
Decide what you want to do.

1767
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:52,480
Do you want to enjoy
your sister's wedding or...

1768
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,440
...take care of your property in Benaras.

1769
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,480
Hello. Hello.

1770
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:57,920
That's what happened.

1771
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:00,880
Big brother,
I need to rush off to Benaras right now.

1772
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:03,120
- What happened?
- I've got work. Goodbye.

1773
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:04,000
Bye, we'll meet again.

1774
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:06,160
- Tell me what's wrong.
- I'll call and inform you.

1775
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:07,720
- Call me.
- Sure.

1776
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,840
Kanaida. Kanaida.

1777
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,280
- What's wrong younger brother?
- We need to go to Benaras right now.

1778
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:13,880
Why?

1779
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,920
I've information that there'll
be income tax raid tomorrow morning.

1780
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
- Oh no!
- Let's go.

1781
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,520
We need to go right now.

1782
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,160
Get in the car. Get in the car.

1783
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:22,720
Let's go. Let's go.

1784
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:32,200
No. I mean--

1785
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:42,400
You've ruined whatever reputation I had.

1786
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:45,760
I wish to kill you right now.

1787
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:47,440
Yes, all the problems have been solved.

1788
02:01:47,680 --> 02:01:48,760
Shruti has come back.

1789
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,680
Finally, I'm getting married to her.

1790
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,120
Everything is fine now.

1791
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:57,840
I'll call back after some time. Bye.

1792
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,040
Yes, tell me.

1793
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,040
Everything is not fine.

1794
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,320
- There is a problem.
- What's it?

1795
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:09,360
- Shruti is pregnant.
- What?!

1796
02:02:09,880 --> 02:02:11,920
Her family members want
to suppress the matter and...

1797
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,760
...get her married to you.

1798
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,640
Big brother,
get Shruti married to Bhaskar before...

1799
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,920
...people get to know that she is pregnant.

1800
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:26,480
Great! You've made a great plan.

1801
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,160
Why are you cheating me in this manner?

1802
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:29,600
Why? What for?

1803
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:32,320
Why will I become the
father of someone else's child?

1804
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:33,920
I won't marry.

1805
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:36,440
Wait.

1806
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:38,600
- Where are you going?
- To die.

1807
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:40,600
Shut up! Come with me.

1808
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:45,040
So, you won't marry
her just for this reason?

1809
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:50,160
Shame! Don't worry,
I'll get you married to a nice guy.

1810
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:54,080
Who will marry her after hearing this?

1811
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:56,880
Someone will. Chotu.

1812
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:06,120
Yes, brother.

1813
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:07,560
He is my brother.

1814
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:09,520
He has passed out of Biswa Bharati today.

1815
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:11,960
There isn't anyone like my brother.

1816
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:13,280
He is always immersed in books.

1817
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,680
Get him married to Shruti once and...

1818
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:17,200
...he'll forget books
and will be with his wife.

1819
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,920
Do you have any objections
to marry Shruti?

1820
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:22,320
Brother, I can give my life for you.

1821
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:25,040
He is my ideal brother. Great going.

1822
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:29,040
Are you ready to marry my brother?

1823
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:35,520
If brother likes him I've no objection.

1824
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:39,480
But, what will I tell the people
who'll come to attend the wedding?

1825
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,160
- Problem solved.
- What?!

1826
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:47,400
Tell everyone that your
sister loved my brother.

1827
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:49,600
You've accepted the relationship
and getting them married in grand style.

1828
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:53,160
Tell them that I eloped with
your sister to get her married...

1829
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,920
...to my brother. That's it.

1830
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,560
Everything is fair and lovely.

1831
02:03:56,680 --> 02:04:00,320
Adi, you've relieved me of great tension.

1832
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:05,040
I can do that easily.

1833
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:09,920
But, we need someone to spread the story.

1834
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:10,520
Yes!

1835
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:13,520
The right person for this is Nepal Das.

1836
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:17,320
Nepal Das. Nepal Das.

1837
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,320
- Nepal!
- Yes.

1838
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:26,080
- Big brother.
- Whom does Shruti love?

1839
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:29,080
- Whom?
- Him.

1840
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:39,520
Now tell me, who kidnapped
Shruti on her wedding day? Him.

1841
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:43,520
- Right!
- You need to tell this story to everyone.

1842
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:44,800
Got it?

1843
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:47,240
Big brother, this is the history.

1844
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:50,520
- Hey you...
- Know just one thing.

1845
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:54,960
If you do this I'll
leave you after the wedding.

1846
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:56,920
But big brother...

1847
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:59,480
Adi, go and explain everything to him.

1848
02:04:59,560 --> 02:05:01,160
Adi...

1849
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:02,920
Come.

1850
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:05,560
Is it enough if the audience understands?

1851
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:07,440
Explain everything to me too.

1852
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:10,880
I've written a new scene
that Shruti is pregnant.

1853
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:13,400
I know Bhaskar won't
marry her after hearing this.

1854
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,040
I'm getting her married to Sudip.

1855
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,520
But, she is already married.

1856
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:20,560
Only we and the viewers know that,
big brother doesn't know it.

1857
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:24,600
You are so smart.

1858
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:29,240
That's why I enjoy the
fruits and you the brickbats.

1859
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:31,240
- Come close to me.
- First class.

1860
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:37,240
This color looks so good on you.

1861
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,840
Sister, your matter is now set.

1862
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:45,200
I hope Adi and I get together
without any problem. Assure me.

1863
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:47,520
Don't be tensed. Everything will be fine.

1864
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:48,480
Are you sure?

1865
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:56,240
Adi! I don't know how to thank you.

1866
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:57,200
Why, big brother?

1867
02:05:57,280 --> 02:06:01,400
Since I entered your
house and got close to you...

1868
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:03,720
...everything is turning out well.

1869
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:07,560
I had thought that I could
never get my sisters married.

1870
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:11,040
- This happened because...
- Brother, I'm leaving.

1871
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:14,320
Bhaskar, where are you going?

1872
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:17,000
Brother, I came here to get married.

1873
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:19,680
Since the wedding is not taking
place it doesn't make any sense...

1874
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,160
...to stay here and get insulted.

1875
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:24,800
- No Bhaskar...
- I came here just for you.

1876
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:28,920
I know. Since I've brought
you home respectfully...

1877
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:31,720
...I'll bid goodbye respectfully.

1878
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,720
By getting you married to Rai.

1879
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:39,040
I'll get both the sisters
married in the same day.

1880
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:40,040
This is final.

1881
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:43,040
Adi, help Bhaskar with shopping.

1882
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:46,360
He shouldn't feel that
I didn't take care of him.

1883
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:48,360
Everything will be fine.

1884
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:50,960
Come in Bhaskar. Come in.

1885
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,520
Oh no! I feel I've left
my credit card in the store.

1886
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,400
Hold this. I'll get it right now.

1887
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:09,920
I paid the bill.
How come he misplaced his credit card?

1888
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:11,680
Let him lose his credit
card and debit card.

1889
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:12,840
Why should you worry?

1890
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,120
I'm getting married in two days.

1891
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,720
Think of how you'll
stop him from marrying me.

1892
02:07:17,560 --> 02:07:18,920
I've planned everything.

1893
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,840
What did you plan?

1894
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:26,960
Listen!

1895
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,840
- Adi!
- I didn't plan this.

1896
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:33,720
Adi! Adi, Raghav Sinha
has sent men to kill me...

1897
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,440
...as I'm marrying Rai.

1898
02:07:35,960 --> 02:07:42,640
Hey! Wait! I'll teach you a lesson.

1899
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:27,720
I've sent men to the
shopping mall to kill Adi.

1900
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:33,520
I've instructed them
to attack you first so that...

1901
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:35,240
...he doesn't suspect anything wrong.

1902
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:40,240
Marry Rai and bring her here.

1903
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:45,440
Then I'll make Dibakar dance to my tunes.

1904
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:51,360
The fact that you are my son
should be kept secret until the wedding.

1905
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:55,400
I have to win this one.

1906
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:27,760
You sent men to kill me.

1907
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:31,280
I'll thrash you so badly
that your share value...

1908
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:35,360
...will drop so steeply that
it'll be sold cheaply in footpath.

1909
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:40,600
Sir, Dibakar's man. - Shoot him.

1910
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:48,560
Even cannon won't help.

1911
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:55,480
You can't kill me because
I know Bhaskar is your son.

1912
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:58,960
Dibakar Roy also knows
it and so he has kept him...

1913
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:00,880
...on the pretext of getting him married.

1914
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,160
Don't try to call him.

1915
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:07,880
His phone has been
snatched and switched off.

1916
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:10,800
I've news for you.

1917
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:13,280
Dibakar Roy is taking everyone
to the temple in their area...

1918
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:14,560
...to offer prayers.

1919
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,040
He is also taking your son along.

1920
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:20,280
We'll kill him there and then inform you.

1921
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:25,280
That's it. Everything is fair and lovely.

1922
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:50,880
- Sir, shall I say something?
- Tell me.

1923
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:56,200
- What if I went in another car?
- Why?

1924
02:11:56,440 --> 02:11:59,680
I can't trust the person driving the car.

1925
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:03,200
- Keep calm.
- How can I?

1926
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:07,480
I feel like I'm driving towards my death.

1927
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:13,040
Lord of death might come
right in the middle of the road.

1928
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:14,440
Have you gone crazy?

1929
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:39,440
Leave my way.

1930
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:42,760
I don't want bloodshed
before my sisters' wedding.

1931
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:48,760
Nothing depends on your wishes.
What I wish will happen.

1932
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:56,360
Give my son back to me else
no one will return alive from here.

1933
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:00,760
Who is your son?

1934
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:06,200
Don't pretend.
I know you are taking my son with you...

1935
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:07,920
...to your area to get him killed.

1936
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:12,400
If I had your son with me
then I wouldn't have wasted petrol...

1937
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:14,080
...to drive so far.

1938
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:15,680
I would've finished him off over there.

1939
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,280
Don't make me angry.

1940
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:22,280
I'm giving you a last chance.

1941
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:24,280
Send my son this side.

1942
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:27,600
Son! Son! I want to know who your son is.

1943
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:29,640
I will tell you.

1944
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:46,600
Enough of the drama! Stop it now.

1945
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,600
Raghav Sinha's son.

1946
02:13:50,360 --> 02:13:51,440
Get hold of him.

1947
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:53,600
Brother!

1948
02:13:57,680 --> 02:14:00,040
Hey Sudev!

1949
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:03,160
Tell them to leave
Bhaskar else I'll kill her.

1950
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:05,000
Hey! Let him go.

1951
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:11,400
Sudev, no. No!

1952
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:13,840
Leave Rai. Leave her.

1953
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,000
Brother!

1954
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:23,600
- Sudev, where are you taking Rai?
- Come on.

1955
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:24,920
Sudev!

1956
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:26,840
Big brother!

1957
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,400
Raghav, this isn't fair. Leave her.

1958
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:35,840
Dibakar, this was my plan.

1959
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:43,040
I planned to get your first
sister married and then burn her alive.

1960
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:48,800
I thought of killing
the second one in Benaras.

1961
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,040
No Raghav, don't do this.

1962
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:54,920
My all plan is not success.

1963
02:14:56,200 --> 02:15:00,360
But now I'll get your younger
sister married to my son.

1964
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:02,800
Let me see who can stop me.

1965
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,240
No, Raghav!

1966
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,600
Raghav!

1967
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:13,440
Raghav!

1968
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:17,600
Just see where the problem was.

1969
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:19,480
You never listened to me.

1970
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:22,000
Adi knew very well that
Bhaskar was Raghav's son.

1971
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:24,960
- But he didn't tell you.
- Nepalda.

1972
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,160
Shut up!

1973
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:30,040
I didn't say anything
till date but today I'll speak.

1974
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:32,720
What did you think?

1975
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:35,600
That you want to get them married?

1976
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:39,040
- They've been married a long time back.
- What?!

1977
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:42,240
Adi had helped Shruti to run away.

1978
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:47,880
- Brother-in-law.
- Hello, sister-in-law.

1979
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:50,560
Reveal your real identity now.

1980
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:56,400
The bluff master is her son.

1981
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:59,080
They are Adi's parents.

1982
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:04,520
And she... the item number
is not everyone's wife but my wife.

1983
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:08,960
He is the one who is behind the drama...

1984
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,520
...just to marry Rai.

1985
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:13,840
He is behind the entire drama.

1986
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,080
He did the right thing.

1987
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:20,080
You just saw the drama.

1988
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:25,680
It's because of the bluff
master that my sister could marry...

1989
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:31,280
...the person she loves.

1990
02:16:32,840 --> 02:16:42,160
Adi, save my younger sister
whom you love from Raghav and...

1991
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:45,560
...do me a last favor.

1992
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:53,400
Where is Adi? Where is Adi?

1993
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:54,920
You are searching Adi?

1994
02:16:57,520 --> 02:17:04,960
Adi has gone away long
away to get his love back.

1995
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:06,040
Well-done, son!

1996
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:05,560
Adi! Adi! Adi!

1997
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:53,200
- Come. Come.
- Adi! Adi!

1998
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:54,840
Come with me.

1999
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,560
Brother! Brother!

2000
02:20:54,880 --> 02:21:01,440
I'll be indebted to you for
life for what you've done today.

2001
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:03,280
I want to know something.

2002
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:05,960
Why did you do all this for a girl?

2003
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:09,720
It's love, big brother. Love.

2004
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:12,600
That's enough!
Everyone knows the rest, Adi.

2005
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:18,560
- Let's click a selfie now.
- Sure.

2006
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:23,480
Wait. Wait.

2007
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:26,840
Let's click it now.

2008
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:29,640
- Now everything is...
- Fair and lovely.

2009
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:31,440
Yes!

2010
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:35,520
"I slipped in your love
and broke previous record."

2011
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:38,800
"Let there be a case against me,
I've given you flying kiss."

2012
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:46,280
"I slipped in your love
and broke previous record."

2013
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:49,920
"Let there be a case against me,
I've given you flying kiss."

2014
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:53,520
'I'll shout out in a loudspeaker. Listen!"

2015
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:57,120
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2016
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:00,600
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2017
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:04,440
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2018
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:08,440
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2019
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:12,240
"I've seen the naughtiness in your eyes."

2020
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:15,880
"I've given my heart to you."

2021
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:19,120
"I'm saying it in your ears. Listen!"

2022
02:22:19,320 --> 02:22:23,040
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2023
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:26,760
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2024
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:30,800
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2025
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:34,720
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2026
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:45,000
"When you signal me to come close,
I feel excited."

2027
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:48,840
"My heart has brightened up."

2028
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:52,920
"You stole my heart and
play hide and seek with eyes."

2029
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,600
"I run as soon as you ask me to get lost."

2030
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:00,080
"When you signal me to come close,
I feel excited."

2031
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:03,920
"My heart has brightened up."

2032
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,600
"You stole my heart and
play hide and seek with eyes."

2033
02:23:07,720 --> 02:23:11,120
"I run as soon as you ask me to get lost."

2034
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:14,560
"I slipped in your love
and broke previous record."

2035
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:18,440
"Let there be a case against me,
I've given you flying kiss."

2036
02:23:18,440 --> 02:23:21,840
"I'll shout out in a loudspeaker. Listen!"

2037
02:23:21,960 --> 02:23:25,640
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2038
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:29,440
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2039
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:33,240
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."

2040
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:37,680
"I've done the right thing
by falling in love. I'll love."
