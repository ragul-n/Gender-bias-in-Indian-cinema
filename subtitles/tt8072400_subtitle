1
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:55,810
HELLO GURU PREMA KOSAME

2
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,070
Sanju Sanju...

3
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,030
You asked me to wake you up at 5
am as you had to bash someone up?

4
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,610
Wake up son...

5
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,450
- Be done with hitting him and then sleep
- Give me 5 minutes.

6
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,240
How can you sleep knowing someone
is teasing your friend's sister?

7
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,400
Get up...

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,490
Don't hit him with your hand, son.
You might get hurt.

9
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,450
Mom

10
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,740
Time to leave son.

11
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,360
Where's his bike? Oh no!

12
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,290
Sister, I don't see the bike outside.

13
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,130
Where did Sanju go so early in the morning?

14
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,070
He woke up early in the morning
and went to bash up someone.

15
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,700
Im getting Brufen and tincture ready for him
if he ends up having injuries or bruises.

16
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,050
Are you his real mother?

17
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,710
Weren't you there when he was
born to her brother-in-law?

18
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,920
Why do you ask like this again?

19
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,780
Brother in law,
too much of pampering isn't good.

20
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,490
- Stop now, it's time he'd be back.
- Mom!

21
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,740
There he comes.
- He's here, move aside.

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,490
- You took the hits instead of hitting them.
- I'll thrash them this time.

23
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,920
I brought the first aid as
you said it was a fight.

24
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,580
I'd have arranged an auspicious
welcome if I knew it was a wedding!

25
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,140
It was a fight I went to.
Laid my hand on him too.

26
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,650
Oh no.

27
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,610
How did the marriage take place
amidst such a big mess son?

28
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,450
- Hear it out.
- Hey, listen...

29
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,450
Are you here to hit me for
teasing Kavya or as I love Kavya?

30
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,370
Your friend said I'm teasing
you as he doesn't like me

31
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,990
Hit me if I'm teasing her.
There is no mistake in that.

32
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,650
But hitting someone
loving genuinely is wrong.

33
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,740
How would we know whether
your love is genuine or not?

34
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,500
How will we know that?

35
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,970
Tell the names of three
of your best friends.

36
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,530
- Ganesh, Sujith and Sreenu
- Call them

37
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,870
Tell me dude.

38
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,600
What's with Kavya and Kalyan dude?

39
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,780
He keeps talking about his love for Kavya
as long as the classes go on in the College.

40
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,280
Oh him! Just like the map of Sri Lanka
comes bundled with that of India,

41
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,370
I have to listen to his poetry
along with his love story

42
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,760
He buys me a beer and keeps narrating his
love story till the wee hours of the night.

43
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,390
Do you believe whatever his friends say?

44
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,110
Hey, a guy might tell a girl he
is loving her without doing so

45
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,620
but he never tells his friends that he
loves her without actually loving her.

46
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,450
As he told his friends about it,
he's definitely in love with her.

47
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,490
So I got them married.

48
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,500
How did you convince her brother, son?

49
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,140
Mom, in this situation either I
should let go of my friendship

50
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,440
or he has to let go of his love.

51
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,990
If I leave a friendship we can
get along some other time in life.

52
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,700
But if leaves his love now,
he can never get it back in life.

53
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,450
Anyway I just believe in something

54
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,490
It isn't hard to sacrifice, but is difficult
to get someone good enough to sacrifice for.

55
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,720
We can if we get such a person.

56
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,730
If you didn't have the concept of calling
the three, we would've been caught.

57
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,530
Actually, that's my concept

58
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,780
Morning dad

59
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:22,820
Where were you last night?

60
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,510
I've been to Satish's
house for combined studies.

61
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,150
Oh, call him once.

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,290
Come on.

63
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,290
Where was my son in the night?

64
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,240
He was at my house, uncle.
We studied together.

65
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,740
You don't trust your grown up son!

66
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,650
Call Eswar.

67
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,290
Dad?

68
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,700
You heard me right, call him.

69
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,020
Are you still high Sanju?

70
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,620
Where was my son in the night?

71
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,610
He studied at my house, uncle.
Combined studies.

72
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,110
Actually dad...

73
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,470
Call Prasad.

74
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,620
- Dad.
- Call him.

75
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,450
- Hello.
- Where was my son last night?

76
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,170
He was at my house in the night.
We studied together.

77
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,990
What man? How many houses was
he studying in just one night?

78
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,420
Be warned!

79
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,880
Doesn't our house have a terrace
or beer stored in the fridge?

80
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,730
Don't you get it when I ask you to booze
silently at this place when you want to?

81
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,070
I'll thrash you all

82
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,870
- Dad.
- Yeah.

83
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,300
Is there a beer in the fridge really?

84
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,700
Hey you!

85
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,050
And Satish, heard you got a job in Hyderabad.
When are you going?

86
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,540
In a couple of days aunty.

87
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,360
When are you coming to Hyderabad?

88
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,630
Hey. We don't get into such things.

89
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,820
If it's a fight,
we'd even rise early and come down

90
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,380
but why do you call us for studies and jobs?

91
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,650
Don't you have any sense?

92
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,280
Just like one raises a family after marriage

93
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,990
Has the migration of people completing
engineering to Hyderabad become mandatory?

94
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,290
We'll go today to Hyderabad.

95
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,130
Get up early in the morning and go to
office and come home in the evening.

96
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,660
We go to office again and come back home.

97
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,820
After spending a week like this,
one night before sleeping, we'll feel

98
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,860
Man!
Did we leave all of them just for money?

99
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,780
That's why, there isn't a chance
that I leave mom, dad and Kakinada.

100
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,110
Why do you always stick to this place?
What's so great here?

101
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,100
You ask me what's there in this place?

102
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,530
"Mom and dad stay with us"

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,780
"They give everything even without asking"

104
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,780
"Relatives stay around"

105
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,990
"They are seen just by moving the
curtains and come to rescue in hardships."

106
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,610
"Friends come as soon as we call them"

107
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,900
"They bring things for fun in the evening"

108
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,240
"There are girls who suit us."

109
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,320
"who'd feel more bad if we don't look
at them thinking they might be upset."

110
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,270
"Our place stands as our strength
in case of fights or quarrels."

111
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,750
"There isn't a place like
hometown throught the globe."

112
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,950
"Native place is the
best place in the world."

113
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,990
"I have a friend who did a similar thing"

114
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,320
"He left the village for his job."

115
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,570
"He sold his land to meet his expenses."

116
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,990
"Now he says his salary doesn't even
support his rent and household needs."

117
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,070
"Let's talk about Venkatrao
from the neighboring house"

118
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,400
"He settled down abroad."

119
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,030
"He calls over Face time."

120
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,900
"and missed out enjoying
the fun face to face."

121
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,280
"Don't fall for feasts at other places."

122
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,790
"Even a regular stew at your
home gives you happiness."

123
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,820
"Native place is the
best place in the world."

124
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,760
"They come to village during festivals"

125
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,120
"They get over excited
during the celebrations."

126
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,560
"Carry back the pickles
and local delicacies"

127
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,550
"and keep eating them sarcely
till the next festival."

128
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,150
"They create groups on WhatsApp."

129
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,570
"They torture people on
the name of chatting."

130
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,860
"They keep waiting for get togethers."

131
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,240
"They lead lonely lives for
the sake of a goos salary."

132
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,070
"It's a work of bonded labor at
another place for a small salary."

133
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:51,740
"Even a small job in native place
is enough if you can enjoy a lot."

134
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,880
"Native place is the
best place in the world."

135
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,740
How long will you stay idle dear?

136
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,820
"I'll talk to my friend and get you a
good job in Hyderabad if you agree."

137
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,070
Come on uncle, see mom and dad.
They are so happily smiling.

138
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,180
Why are you tensed?

139
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,780
Are they smiling or are they happy?

140
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,990
They pretend to be smiling
while suffering within.

141
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,250
Twist it harder.

142
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,900
- No uncle, how can I leave you all...
- Give it a try.

143
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,740
It's not about me but even mom
and dad can't stay without me

144
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,530
They'll make fuss even if I spend
a night at a friend's place.

145
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,770
- If at all I go to Hyderabad...
- They too will give it a try.

146
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,240
Do something.

147
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,070
Tell them a lie that you're
going to Hyderabad for a job.

148
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,650
You'll get to know what they feel actually.
You can decide yourself then.

149
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,150
Dad, uncle is suggesting me a job in
Hyderabad, and I'm considering it.

150
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,900
- Really?
- Is it true?

151
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,280
That Nancharaiah has been acting
haughty that his son is working in Pune.

152
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,740
I'll teach him a lesson the next time.

153
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,280
Let anybody say my son is at home and
not working, I'll take them to task.

154
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,450
Where will you stay in Hyderabad, son?

155
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,490
- Let's ask him to stay at my friend's house.
- I won't stay in others' places.

156
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,120
- Trust your mom son.
- Please listen to me.

157
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,980
They are so good...

158
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,650
...all your skepticism will change into
fondness if you stay with them for a while.

159
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,740
- No mom.
- Okay?

160
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,700
- Please son. Say okay.
- Okay.

161
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,710
Your attention please! Train No...

162
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,150
Here is the water bottle.

163
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,820
Ok, but why did you take so much time?

164
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,320
A guy in a red striped shirt was
misbehaving at the soft drink shop.

165
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,530
A red striped shirt?

166
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,820
Nowadays, I'm scared to travel to
Hyderabad from Kakinada in a train.

167
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,470
All the boys share the same
motto once they board the train.

168
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,210
They keep checking all the coaches.

169
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,150
They stop wherever they
see a beautiful girl.

170
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,450
They wait till we sleep and then
they hold us tightly and run away.

171
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,310
Disgusting.

172
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,030
Ok, be careful. The guy wearing red
striped shirt might get into your coach.

173
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,470
To hell with them.

174
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,120
Guys from Kakinada can never top a
Hyderabadi in terms of intelligence.

175
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,450
I'll bash him up, ask him to come.

176
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,060
Hey that's not me!

177
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,890
Can't guys from Kakinada can top a
Hyderabadi in terms of intelligence?

178
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,050
How low she considers our place!

179
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,990
We shouldn't sleep tonight
until we ruin her sleep.

180
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,520
Take the shirt off. Now.

181
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,360
Bye.

182
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,650
A guy in a red striped shirt was
misbehaving at the soft drink shop.

183
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,740
They keep checking all the coaches.
They stop wherever they see a beautiful girl.

184
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,400
Go go...

185
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,690
Oh god!

186
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,610
Hello aunty...

187
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,110
Yes, I'm Anupama speaking.

188
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,250
I'm in a train, will talk to you later.

189
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,500
Ok, bye.

190
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,490
Ufma... Sir ufma.

191
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
- What's that?
- Ufma.

192
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,610
That isn't Ufma man. It's Upma. Say Upma.

193
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,240
- Ufma.
- Anupma.

194
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,260
Say it... Upma.

195
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,360
Ufma...
I can't take your coacing in the coach.

196
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,610
Ufma ufma...

197
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,770
Ticket please...

198
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,610
What's the time boy?

199
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,570
7:30

200
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,450
She didn't sleep yet to proceed dude.

201
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,430
The girl's in a good shape.

202
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,150
Whatever may happen,
I'll hold her tightly once and run away.

203
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,770
They'd just hit me if I'm caught.

204
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,360
I can take that risk for such a beauty.

205
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,820
You disconnect.

206
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,430
Aah!

207
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,630
- How much is it?
- It's 250 bucks ma'am.

208
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,160
I don't have the change.

209
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,630
I don't need the change, keep it.

210
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,550
How dare he's followed me home!

211
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:18,730
Daddy...

212
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,250
Open the door dad.

213
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,170
Dad, make it fast!

214
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,210
Hey, why are you ringing the
bell so many times? Get in.

215
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,270
Who?

216
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,780
Hope she never messes
with Kakinada guys again.

217
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:33,890
Sanju!

218
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,470
This is the house Sanju! Come on in.

219
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,390
You didn't answer my called when I called
you to inform Anu was on the same train too!

220
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,610
Come.

221
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,790
- Caught unaware!
- Come.

222
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,560
Come on in!

223
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,580
Why did you ring the bell in such tension?

224
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,040
Who is he?

225
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,300
Don't I keep talking about my
friend Gayatri in Kakinada?

226
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,100
Her son, Sanju.

227
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,880
He got a job in Hyderabad,
so I asked him to stay here.

228
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,420
You come in. Laxmi...

229
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,930
Laxmi, here is our Gayatri's son.

230
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,560
Hello Aunty...

231
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,750
- Son, are you a devotee of Hanuman?
- No Aunty, why do you ask?

232
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,960
I thought so as you are
carrying the bag with one hand.

233
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,920
- Then you are the ghost of our house
- Ghost?

234
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,340
Mom, that's guest. Not a ghost.

235
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,460
Mom doesn't know English

236
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,500
Oh! So it's a guest.

237
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,050
Ghost means a devil. Come mom.

238
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,710
Then I was right!
Why do you say I don't know English?

239
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,880
- Look boy.
- Its Sanju.

240
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,800
- You catch some rest. We'll talk later.
- Ok uncle.

241
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:54,840
Strange.

242
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,890
The room looks good.

243
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,350
Hey boy, one minute.

244
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,750
It was him I was talking about.

245
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,410
She's working as a doctor at NIMS hospital.

246
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,840
General Surgeon Dr. Sailaja ma'am,
my elder daughter.

247
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,520
And yeah, she said there were too many
mosquitoes in the train yesterday night.

248
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,250
She said she had no sleep.
Is it the same with you too?

249
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

250
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,000
- Mom is calling Uncle.
- Oh, go ahead then!

251
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,090
- Yeah.
- Is everything okay there son?

252
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,000
Let's have a word before that.

253
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,880
What's that?

254
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,630
I feel like killing you
as soon as I'm back home.

255
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,800
What happened son?

256
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,380
What then?
You threw me into a ladies hostel here.

257
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,750
Three ladies are roaming around
in night wear here, I'm going mad.

258
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,400
Who is the third? They are just two of them!

259
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,370
One mom and two daughters,
aren't they enough?

260
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,500
Oh her? the elder one Sailu
is not their own daughter.

261
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
She's a friend's daughter.
She stays in a hostel.

262
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,710
She might have come to see him.
Did I tell you about him?

263
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,070
When he gives a word to someone,
he does anything for it.

264
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,680
When Sailu's was a child, her dad met with
an accident and was in serious condition,

265
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,250
my friend went to see him.

266
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,570
On his death bed...

267
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:24,040
when he felt sad that he wanted to see his
daughter as a doctor but wasn't able to

268
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,920
My friend gave a word to him that
he'd join Sailu in MBBS course.

269
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,590
Earlier, he was planning to make
his own daughter study MBBS.

270
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,170
As his financial status didn't
support two girls to pursue MBBS,

271
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,670
he stood on his word and made his
friend's daughter finish her MBBS

272
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,420
and has made his own
daughter pursue Engineering.

273
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,920
It's hard to believe such people
exist in today's world son.

274
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,470
But his wife feels something bad
happens at home when he gives a word...

275
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,780
...and displays sarcasm in her words.

276
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,550
Ok, give the phone to him if possible.

277
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,020
- See you daddy, bye.
- Fine.

278
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,300
Bye.

279
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,130
- Bye.
- Good Bye.

280
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,800
Actually, you know mom doesn't know English,
don't you?

281
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,050
Ok. See you.

282
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,550
Mom, good bye means parting forever.

283
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,710
That's what I said.
Why do you say I don't know English?

284
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,280
- Mom wants to talk.
- Yeah.

285
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,800
- Tell me Gayatri.
- What's my son saying?

286
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,460
Whoever wants some coffee can have it.

287
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,000
Hello.

288
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,880
Yes, tell me.

289
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,710
He got Shailu into MBBS
as he promised her dad.

290
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,920
She left to stay in a
hostel once she got a job.

291
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,380
When some friend was in need of money,
he promised to help him.

292
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,750
When we mortgaged the house and gave
him money, he absconded raising an IP.

293
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,800
We're having to pay that money
and the rent for this house.

294
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,380
He brought in this guy into a house
where there's a grown up girl.

295
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,050
Keep watching,
even this guy would create problems.

296
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,150
Beware!
He might start playing things like love.

297
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,300
Nothing of that sort would happen mom.
I promise you I'll be careful.

298
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,500
I'll take care of it.

299
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,880
Anu's college falls on the way to
your office. Will you drop her daily?

300
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,670
- Actually, it's far for me.
- Oh, no problem uncle.

301
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,500
Hey, stop...

302
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,850
What's with your beard?
Would you go to work unshaven?

303
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,050
Oh no. There are a lot of expectations
for an entry into a software office.

304
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,740
You'll see me on the silver screen tomorrow.

305
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,310
Who's this guy?

306
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,990
- He has recently moved into Anu's house bro.
- Okay.

307
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,890
I think he's going to compete
with you in wooing her.

308
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,500
Huh! What's his ability when compared to me?

309
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,710
Where does his glamour stand before me?

310
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,250
While studying Engineering,
seeing 40 girls in just the CSE class,

311
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,670
we know how jealous the students
from other branches feel.

312
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,660
God exists.

313
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,840
He's given me what I missed out there.

314
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,210
Back there,
it was just a guavava tree bearing 60 fruits.

315
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:28,000
And here it's a guava garden,
fruits enough for everyone.

316
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,710
I've joined just now, where's my computer?

317
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,840
They'd first train you. They'd assign
you a computer only after you pass.

318
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:41,960
What if I fail?

319
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,050
They'll give a ticket of Kesineni Travels.
You can go back to where you came from.

320
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,380
- Oh! Where's the training room?
- That way.

321
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,590
What girls dude!

322
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,680
Whether its a school, college or office...

323
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,410
...do you know what's the first
thing they do the day they join?

324
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,710
Boys checking out on girls and
girls checking out on boys...

325
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,870
and choosing them.

326
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,550
- Good morning guys.
- Good morning sir.

327
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,250
The real time experience in JAVA...

328
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,460
Sir, we just arrived,
whats the hurry for the class?

329
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,540
Let's start it after a
round of introductions.

330
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,920
Haven't everyone signed
an agreement for an year?

331
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,730
So you have an year time for introductions.

332
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,920
How many of you know about
real time experience?

333
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,340
Hello...

334
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,090
You... stand up.

335
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,250
Yeah.

336
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,880
You tell me.

337
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,240
Haven't I signed an
agreement for an year sir?

338
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,870
So I have an year time to know about it.

339
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,460
The girl is impressed. Continue it Sanju.

340
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,800
Don't play the jokes you
use at your village here,

341
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,050
Oh no! The village jokes are diffrerent sir.
These are freshly knit.

342
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,620
I've got this bunch separately for the city.

343
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,750
She's on track. Go ahead!

344
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,220
Hello, talk to me in English.
Didn't you study in the English Medium?

345
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,300
Sir, English medium in a village
teaches only medium English.

346
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,880
But we know complete Telugu..

347
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,450
Damn!

348
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,250
Do you know who are saving the Telugu
language from becoming extinct?

349
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,090
It's the English medium students
like us from the villages sir.

350
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,940
Shut up! How and why did they
give this job to a guy like you?

351
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,340
What are the languages did
you mention in your resume?

352
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,530
Telugu, English and Hindi.

353
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,300
I'm asking you about the
programming languages.

354
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,010
Sir, whether I write or type in the computer,
I just know those three languages.

355
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,230
Telugu, English and Hindi.

356
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,000
I am asking about C, C++, JAVA, etc.

357
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,630
Oh! I See.

358
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,670
Why does he say I see instead
of answering my question?

359
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,120
What hobbies did you mention?

360
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,300
Shall I tell my hobbies or
those I mentioned in the resume?

361
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,050
- Are they both different?
- It's natural.

362
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,000
Tell me yours first and then
about the ones in the resume.

363
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,000
What hobbies do we have in towns sir?

364
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,250
- Going to movies after informing mom.
- Is it?

365
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,610
- Smoking without dad's notice.
- Oh!

366
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,960
Playing cricket in free time,
make time and flirt with girls.

367
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,230
But in resume, reading books, watching news

368
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:35,750
- Reading books.
- Huh?

369
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,070
- Watching news.
- Oh!

370
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,940
- Browsing net...
- A humble request to you.

371
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,750
- It's granted.
- Really!

372
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,540
Please tell your wife about your
crazy thoughts before marriage.

373
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,170
- Why?
- She'll become a scape goat otherwise.

374
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,800
Let's not discuss about marriage sir.

375
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,360
In a recent survey

376
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,670
they got to know that there are just 945
girls available per 1000 guys in India.

377
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,710
That means 55 boys are left over single.

378
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,260
Being depressed about not getting married,

379
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,750
they are turning into Atal Bihari Vajpayees,
Abdul Kalams and Ratan Tatas.

380
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,560
But those 945 men who got
married happily are...

381
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,170
Did the cooker give 5 or 6 whistles?

382
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,000
Did we turn the gas off
while leaving home or not?

383
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,380
Should we join our kids in Sri Chaitanya
college that scores multiple first ranks?

384
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,280
or in Narayana college with
the same multiple first ranks?

385
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:21,840
They are living in such confusions?

386
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,360
Do we need these marriages sir?

387
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,120
Oh, thank you...

388
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,960
- Will you come to office tomorrow?
- I will sir.

389
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,630
- Then, I'll not.
- But why sir?

390
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,750
That's all, bye.

391
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,090
It's strange. Is it done?

392
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,960
Why not just say sorry.

393
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:05,590
Anu...

394
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,420
Looks like the brain wouldn't work
unless I have a smoke immediately.

395
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,340
Ahem ahem...

396
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,670
God!
Looks like I'm destined to be caught by her.

397
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,080
The damage has been done anyways.

398
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,860
Anu...

399
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,120
Please listen to me... one minute...
Let's talk about it once!

400
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:50,800
Please...

401
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,420
Look, we both have to live
in the same house from now.

402
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,000
Don't put on an irritated face.
Sorry for what happened in the train.

403
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,640
When you said Kakinada guys can never top
a Hyderabadi in terms of intelligence.

404
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,120
I got emotional and teased you.

405
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,000
But basically I'm a good boy

406
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,590
- Is it!
- I've seen it.

407
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,500
Come on, it's true. Look...

408
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,380
Ok, no fingers...

409
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,770
I mean, stop talking to me if you
get to know that I'm not a good guy

410
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,210
- Otherwise..
- How would I know?

411
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,170
Ok,
you ask me some random questions about me.

412
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,790
Taking my answers into account

413
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,020
If you have anything you don't like in me,
take a Coffee Bean and place it in this.

414
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,280
By the time you are done
with your questions,

415
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,350
I'll have an idea on how much you don't
like me and how much should I change. Okay?

416
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,360
Do it.

417
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,670
- Don't play such childish games with me.
- Hey, try it once!

418
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,340
Please try just once.

419
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,250
Ok, when did you come to
Hyderabad for the first time?

420
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,550
Huh, I didn't come.
It's a recommendation job.

421
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,250
I mean,
I don't have much interest to work here.

422
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,500
I mean,
as I didn't like to come away from my place.

423
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,460
I mean, was unable to see my dad's pain.

424
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,420
Either you like or not,
I don't really like coming to Hyderabad.

425
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,710
I came just for my dad.

426
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,500
What else could I do?

427
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,290
Do you know what's the income
of a middle class father?

428
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,580
It's equal to his son's education.

429
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,470
If his son studies till 10th standard,
that means his income is till there.

430
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,910
The same rule is valid for
intermediate and engineering too.

431
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,210
Paying school and college fees for 20 years,
giving pocket money every day...

432
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:36,750
Paying for uniforms, shoe, ties, all
stationery items and India maps every year.

433
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,500
Dad spent his whole life for me and has
asked for just for one thing in return.

434
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:41,660
A job.

435
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,550
Huh... even in the favor that he asked,
It's me who gets the salary and not him.

436
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,280
That's why

437
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,590
Even though I don't like it,
I came here for taking up the job for him.

438
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,300
Why are you leaving amidst the talk?

439
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,710
That one answer is enough
to excuse all the rest.

440
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,170
Sorry accepted.

441
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,340
So...

442
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,200
Friends?

443
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,170
Only friends.

444
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,590
Yeah only friends.

445
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,420
Hello, no smoking here.
There's a pan shop outside for that.

446
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,360
Oh!

447
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,240
- Brother.
- Yes.

448
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,280
Competition.

449
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,380
What's the fate of boys like me without
a wine shop and pan shop in every area?

450
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,100
Hello Boss...

451
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,960
Is it you who moved in to Anu's house?

452
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,670
Look here...

453
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,540
Brother is in love with Anu from two years.

454
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,350
Even you can't create a
rift between them now.

455
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,060
- Are you seriously in love with Anu?
- Yeah.

456
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,840
Tell me your story briefly!

457
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,770
I saw Anu for the first time when
she was on her way to college.

458
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:14,870
"Background music from the
movie Preminchukundam Raa"

459
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,170
'This isn't the way Giri...'

460
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,710
'What's this like a kid?
Come on... think of something else.'

461
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,920
It's better to present her a gift.

462
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,590
Okay.

463
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:46,340
"Background music from the
movie Preminchukundam Raa"

464
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,750
To see her every day,
I opened my garage right in this area.

465
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,850
She used to come to this Ganesh
every time she had a repair.

466
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,530
But why do I feel Anu has reacted a
bit more than enough in your story?

467
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,940
That's my imagination boss.

468
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,210
Look my dear, I already am
connected to a girl in the office.

469
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,340
I've a doubt that, it maybe love.

470
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,710
You don't get tensed...

471
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,250
Ok, are you confident enough?
Is it just a friend at home?

472
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,500
And is it love at the office?

473
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,610
Why do you get tensed unnecessarily?

474
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,340
What's my ability when compared to yours?

475
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,300
Where does my glamour stand before yours?

476
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,700
Hello.. Everybody.

477
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,590
Madam, order please

478
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,700
Yeah... two black coffee.

479
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:36,450
Okay.

480
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,240
- And two spring rolls
- Ok madam.

481
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,400
Anything else madam?

482
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,400
- And two grilled sandwiches.
- Sure madam.

483
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,020
Thank you madam

484
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,110
Hey, are you ok?

485
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:13,570
Thank you

486
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,700
Brother...

487
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,200
- Tell her you've run out of grilled sandwich
- I won't lie.

488
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,110
Brother, I'm new to Hyderabad. I brought a
girl for the first time to a coffee shop.

489
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,990
- I'm low on funds.
- Ok, I'll lie.

490
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,270
You just denied?

491
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,650
Earlier, I used to bring a girl daily to
this coffee shop, order and pay the bill.

492
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,820
Now,
I'm taking orders and collecting the bills.

493
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,080
You won't look good in this dress.
So I'll lie.

494
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,020
Sorry ma'am, we don't have grilled sandwich.

495
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,210
Oh, that's ok.

496
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,950
Two red velvet cakes.

497
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,420
Tell her you don't have them too.

498
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,280
Err...
sorry madam, we don't have those cakes.

499
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,530
Hey, why did you say we are out of red
velvet cakes? There are so many lying.

500
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,950
Yes. We have those cakes madam.
How many portions do you want?

501
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,720
Two.

502
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:04,590
- Two?
- Yeah.

503
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,110
Hey, you come aside. You...

504
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,530
So, what type of a girl do you need?

505
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,220
As I said yesterday, right?

506
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,390
I need a girl who doesn't ask me to turn
off the cooker watching the whistles.

507
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,340
And you?

508
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,610
I need a guy who turns the cooker off
before I even remind him of the whistles.

509
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:42,730
Thats okay.

510
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,260
If we get a girl like you, forget the cooker
whistles, we would just do anything you say.

511
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,150
Do you eat words?

512
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,030
Oh, it's Dad's call. I have to go.

513
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,360
Have to go? And after ordering so much?

514
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,010
- That's okay. Do I drop you?
- No!

515
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,220
It doesn't look good is if dad sees us.
I'll book a cab.

516
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,280
I'll book it.

517
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,040
It's here

518
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:13,650
I'll go and come.

519
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,950
You are done for if he doesn't pay up.

520
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,900
- Careful.
- Ok sir.

521
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,140
Bye.

522
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:14,120
Hello.

523
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,820
- Hello.
- Are you going to be late?

524
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,400
Actually,
I came to a coffee shop with a girl.

525
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,650
We had coffee and they gave a bill.

526
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,990
We'll pay if there's money enough for bill.

527
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,240
If not they'll tie me up.

528
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,780
Please come and release me before they do!

529
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,340
Anu.

530
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,740
Miss you too.

531
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,530
Anu, get me some coffee. My head is aching.

532
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:11,910
- What boy
- Uncle.

533
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,770
Will you have a coffee too?

534
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,450
He just has black coffee
and nothing else dad.

535
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,610
Then, prepare the same.

536
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,130
Do you know how to prepare it?

537
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,170
Even if I do,
he'll not have that with people like us dad

538
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,730
- He has others for that.
- Hey, please.

539
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,610
Whom will he have it with? What man?

540
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,490
Anu, I don't need rice tonight.
Prepare chapati dear.

541
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,820
Is chapathi okay boy?

542
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,150
He doesn't eat anything
other than spring rolls dad.

543
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,490
Ok, prepare the same.

544
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,990
And he won't eat even those with people
like us, he'll have others for that dad.

545
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,030
Please, no.

546
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,280
Whom do you eat with boy?

547
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,820
- Laxmi.
- Yes.

548
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,780
- Do we have those laddoos from Bandar?
- Yes.

549
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,450
Serve one for each for me and him.

550
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,990
I don't want it uncle, thanks.

551
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,040
- He doesn't...
- He doesn't eat laddoos.

552
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,660
What else will he eat?

553
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,500
Red velvet cakes and that too...

554
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,400
He won't even that with people like us.
With whom will he eat then?

555
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,700
Please don't, I beg you.

556
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,280
- What's wrong with you both?
- No idea uncle

557
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,860
- Boy, have the meal.
- Enough uncle, I had too much already.

558
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,030
What's this bull shit?

559
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,900
Boy, that isn't bull shit but blue shirt.
She doesn't know English, remember?

560
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,030
Blue shirt?

561
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:36,530
Okay.

562
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,100
Mom,
bull shit means what's this dirty thing?

563
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,610
I said it correctly.
Why do you say I don't know English?

564
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,320
- She's a friend, right?
- Yes, man.

565
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,720
Shall we have a juice?

566
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,740
No thanks. Why would you have it with us?

567
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:12,880
Damn! I'm always getting caught by her.

568
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,280
I should either kill her or die myself.
Bloody nonsense.

569
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,860
Has she heard it?

570
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
I mean...

571
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:33,780
What's that for?

572
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,640
If she calls for coffee again

573
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,450
I don't like it if my friend is embarrassed
before her for not having money.

574
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:40,670
- But Anu...
- Bye.

575
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,820
- Are you sure she is a friend?
- A friend of course.

576
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,600
Then love?

577
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,910
"With large eyes"

578
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,090
"into my small heart"

579
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,520
"Hey baby you peeped in"

580
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,850
"With your tempting smiles"

581
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,470
"You touched my tiny heart."

582
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,880
"You pinched me like hell, hey girl."

583
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,220
"Like the stars around the moon"

584
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,700
"Your thoughts surrounded me."

585
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,290
"Like an ant bites when you
put a finger in its nest."

586
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,320
"They caught and bit me."

587
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,820
"With large eyes"

588
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,900
"into my small heart"

589
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:06,080
"Hey baby you peeped in"

590
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,960
Oh yeah!

591
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,690
"I have no grip in English language."

592
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,070
"I haven't read Telugu grammar."

593
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,630
"I can't say poetry in Hindi"

594
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,940
"It's your greatness
behind this poetry in me."

595
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,630
"I understood the greatness of Athreya"

596
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,030
"I applauded naughtiness of Veturi."

597
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,670
"Though I heard the songs from longback"

598
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,810
"I liked them and am singing today."

599
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,570
"Just like learning to
walk at 25 years of age"

600
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,990
"I'm toddling around."

601
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,970
"With large eyes"

602
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,460
"into my small heart"

603
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,330
"Hey baby you peeped in"

604
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,030
- Hello
- Hey, what's up?

605
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,620
Everything is fine. You tell me.

606
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,700
Sanju, you're in Hyderabad now.
It's better to pick up your English.

607
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,340
Oh!
I English, you English and spoken English?

608
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:56,930
Now, you speak English.

609
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,700
So, what's your plan?

610
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,240
499 Rupees with unlimited
class with 4 GB mobile data.

611
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,450
Oh no! It's a bad joke.

612
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,130
You say that's bad?

613
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,520
People laugh over this joke
for an hour in my town?

614
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,370
Ok, let's catch up some time.

615
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,520
No. No catches. Only bowling or batting.

616
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:22,950
- I said let's meet today
- Aaw! Is it okay in the house?

617
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,740
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, nobody in house. I'm okay.

618
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,110
He says there's no one at home. Is it okay?

619
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:38,400
Maybe he's gonna propose me at home!
I shouldn't miss this chance.

620
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,790
Ok, let's meet at 8 PM?

621
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,510
- Okay then, bye.- Bye.

622
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,860
Why did she ask me to come home when
no one is at home? Oh I feel shy.

623
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:52,570
He called me home at 8. Yeah,
I started already.

624
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,130
- Where are you going?
- Actually.

625
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:58,570
It seems there are stones diagnosed
in the kidney for my friend's dad.

626
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,060
I'll go and visit him dad.

627
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,740
I feel boulders hitting my heart
when you leave home at this time.

628
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,950
- Come back soon dear.
- Ok dad.

629
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:05,950
Yeah.

630
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,740
Where are you headed at this time boy?

631
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,070
It seems there is a technical
problem at the office uncle.

632
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,820
As the manager called me and
begged me for an hour to solve it

633
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,110
I said I'd be there in half an hour.

634
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,200
I'll solve it and come uncle.

635
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,700
- Oh!
- Aaw!

636
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,700
- See you uncle
- Okay then.

637
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,190
Hi... Uncle.

638
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,990
- Who are you dear?
- Is Sanju in, uncle?

639
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,820
You come in dear, come.

640
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:43,140
Hi...

641
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,590
Uncle.

642
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,230
- Is Reethu in?
- Come in.

643
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,860
Sanju has been to office
on an urgent work dear.

644
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,770
Have you come on any important work?

645
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,650
He donated blood to my dad the day before.
So I came to thank him.

646
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,580
Damn, why did I say such an idiotic lie?

647
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:13,150
- Oh no, what happened to your dad?
- Amnesia, uncle.

648
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:14,830
This is better.

649
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,780
Do they donate blood for Amnesia?

650
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:24,050
That is, actually my dad got a
heart attack and forgot that.

651
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:28,860
It turned serious and an open heart
surgery was done, so Sanju donated blood.

652
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:33,660
It would have been better if your dad
was here to say thanks for that, right?

653
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,820
He too should've come uncle,
but he forgot that too.

654
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,770
Ok, see you uncle

655
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,400
What work do you have with Reethu?

656
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,030
She had some doubts and I
came to clarify them uncle.

657
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,860
Reethu clarifies everyone's doubts.
Have you come to clarify her doubts?

658
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,780
Do you have so much talent in you?

659
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:55,740
Yes uncle.

660
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:56,900
What is data base?

661
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,280
- Uncle?
- Explain data base.

662
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,240
A database...is called database

663
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,650
Have at least you understood
what you just said?

664
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:19,300
Oh no, didn't you catch it?
Ok, I'll say it once again.

665
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,780
A database...

666
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,610
If you're going to repeat what you just said,
don't say it.

667
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:26,930
Okay.

668
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,750
What's Oops concept?

669
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,570
It's a very silly question uncle.

670
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,060
- Ain't it?
- Yeah.

671
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:37,800
Tell me.

672
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,360
But, I missed the class
exactly the day it was taught.

673
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:41,210
Oops!

674
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,390
- What is an Array?
- Pass.

675
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,530
Is this any quiz show? What is a pass?

676
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,340
I mean, I was talking about passing this sir.
Which way?

677
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:56,640
That way.

678
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,370
This Reethu is like...

679
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,310
Phone?

680
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:09,910
Thanks for coming so long
and dropping me uncle. Bye.

681
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:13,390
Girl, let me see your dad
as he was operated recently.

682
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,450
Ok, bring me a glass of water dear

683
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,240
Okay.

684
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,070
Ok, what were you asking? What's an array?

685
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,030
An Array is a...

686
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,150
Ok, tell me now. What's an array?

687
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,110
Uncle, water

688
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:50,930
Uncle...

689
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,780
- Who's he?
- His uncle

690
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,140
Who is this fellow?

691
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,570
Sir, you ask who is he? Do you forget
the guy who donated blood to you?

692
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,360
Did I donate blood?

693
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,210
Did he give me blood?

694
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,900
Didn't he donate it when
you had the heart operation?

695
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,240
Was my heart operated?

696
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:13,240
- What? Does he have such bad Amnesia?
- I don't know uncle. Crazy guy.

697
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,650
- Do I even have Amnesia too?
- Great thing sir.

698
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,490
You've even forgotten
the fact that you forget!

699
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,200
Who're all these baby?
Why did they come here?

700
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,110
Will you remember even if she say it?

701
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,700
Let's go uncle.
What's our business here now?

702
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:26,740
I'll not talk to you again.

703
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,490
Is this the one who damaged his kidney?

704
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,320
It's his brain that got damaged,
not the kidney.

705
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,740
Don't go around with mad people.
Go and sleep.

706
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:45,850
Hey!

707
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:48,040
Thank you.

708
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,290
So, you said you're going to Sanju's
house yesterday. What happened?

709
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,370
I thought Sanju called me home
to propose me and went prepared.

710
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:59,250
He confused me with his broken
English and upset the whole plan.

711
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,910
Is it? What do you intend to do now?

712
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,440
I'm planning to tell it myself today.

713
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,450
Why late then? Call him.

714
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,040
- Hello.- Hello.

715
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,390
Where are you?

716
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,760
- Right here, at the NIMS Hospital.
- Hospital? What happened?

717
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,670
- Nothing, a small accident...
- An accident? Are you okay?

718
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:22,210
- No Reethu...
- Wait, I'm coming right away.

719
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,790
- Hey!
- How did this happen?

720
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,540
Actually, to apologize for what happened
yesterday, I stopped at the flower shop.

721
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,910
- Is the bouquet for the friend?
- It's for the lover dude.

722
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,250
Lover is in college right?

723
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,500
It's the office, man.

724
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:08,830
It's the friend at office right?

725
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,160
It's believable as he said
without any confusion.

726
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,120
Once these two settle down,
it's then me and Anu

727
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,870
Hello Boss, I too will come.

728
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,250
He said he'd accompany me
but went with that fellow.

729
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,040
Couldn't you just say that you
didn't meet with the accident?

730
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,450
You know how much worried was I?

731
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,500
She says she was worried.

732
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,350
Sorry for making you worry.

733
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:40,040
- Do you need to use the word sorry with me?
- It's so confirmed!

734
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:46,160
- What did he say?
- Nothing, you say.

735
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,200
You didn't come to office today, right?

736
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,750
I was thinking...

737
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,660
- One minute.
- Yes.

738
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,700
Hello, is Anu with you?

739
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,750
No aunty, why?

740
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,830
She isn't answering the phone since long.

741
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,040
Maybe she is in the class aunty.

742
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,290
She called saying her classes were cancelled
and was starting when it disconnected.

743
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,370
When I called again, it says switched off.

744
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:27,040
I'm feeling very much tensed.

745
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,240
Don't get tensed aunty,
I'll just check and call you back

746
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,200
Okay.

747
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,750
What happened?

748
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:37,400
You take a cab and go home.
Call me once you reach.

749
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,790
But tell me what happened.

750
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,120
Nothing, it's just a small work.
You go carefully.

751
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,040
- Tell me what happened and go.
- WhatsApp me the cab driver's number.

752
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,650
You should drink liquor for a high.
Why did you mess with her?

753
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,910
Little do I know that she would do that!

754
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,040
Hey, cops are killing us if they come
to know that someone messed with girls.

755
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,750
If they know about all this,
what would happen?

756
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,080
Anu.

757
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:32,580
Anu!

758
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,040
Shh! Silence.

759
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:57,870
Silence!

760
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,250
What happened? You left tensed!

761
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,330
- Nothing, have you reached home?
- Yes.

762
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,290
- Is everything fine there?
- It's all fine. Tell me.

763
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,750
Actually, I was about to tell you something.

764
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,830
But you left by then.

765
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,620
What was that? Tell me?

766
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,620
I don't know whether I
can say that so early.

767
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,660
I'm telling you waht I felt in my heart.

768
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:39,160
I think...
I think I'm in love with you Sanju

769
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:46,580
Don't know why but the first day I saw you,
I kept looking at you for the whole day.

770
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,580
I enjoyed whatever you did.

771
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:53,910
I felt I could lead the whole
life smiling if I'm with you.

772
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,560
Instead of giving me a treat
at the coffee shop and leaving

773
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,730
you booked a cab for me and
waited till I get into the cab

774
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,200
gave him money, took his number and left.

775
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,620
I felt such caring is hard
to get from anyone in life.

776
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:12,790
I felt what more reasons
do I need to love a person.

777
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,450
That's why I am telling you,
I strongly believe that I'm in love with you.

778
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,620
I too understand now when
you're telling me Reethu.

779
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,380
I think I'm also in love.

780
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,160
Then say, I love you Reethu

781
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,410
I'm in love with Anu.

782
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,250
Sanju?

783
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:45,830
First time when I saw Anu in train,
I kept watching her for that whole night

784
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,160
I enjoyed whatever she did.

785
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,830
After you said it now, I feel I could
lead my whole life smiling being with her.

786
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,620
She came and paid the bill that day
after you left from the coffee shop.

787
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:59,950
Thinking I may be into trouble again,
next day she gave me money.

788
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,540
After you said it now, I feel where
else would I get such caring in life.

789
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,290
Even just now, you know how I came running
tensd that she isn't lifting calls?

790
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,750
My heart didn't calm down till I saw her.

791
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:16,080
I too understand now
after you said it Reethu.

792
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,370
What more reasons do we
need to love a person?

793
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:27,120
I just realized, I'm in love with Anu

794
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,750
What would you say now finally?

795
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,200
What's running in your mind at this moment?

796
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,990
I feel what we experienced towards
each other till now is just attraction.

797
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,560
So friends...

798
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,120
Sanju... shall we leave?

799
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:01,100
Did the far away sky far away
come close and pamper me?

800
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:08,510
"Not feeling the burden,
did it pull the earth along with me?"

801
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:13,210
"I never had this habit
of flying in air earlier"

802
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:16,850
"Some mistake took place even
before observing what happened."

803
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,660
"Saying this sweet mischief
is because of you."

804
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,630
"My world is flying"

805
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,430
"like a kite that cut it's thread".

806
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:38,100
"I'm just flying"

807
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,570
"Like the flight that
chose the destination."

808
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:08,000
"I've a feeling like my lids are
flying when I want to sleep."

809
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,670
"Have my eyes forgotten to sleep?"

810
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:15,470
"I feel my feet flying,
when I want to go out."

811
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,990
"Did my feet forget walking?"

812
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,670
"To tell it to you, I feel my workds flying"

813
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,300
"Did my lips forget talking?"

814
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:32,680
"I can't stay still, sit tight,
I'm liking this falling in love."

815
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:37,120
"My world is flying"

816
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,870
"like a kite that cut it's thread".

817
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:44,410
"I'm just flying"

818
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:48,100
"Like the flight that
chose the destination."

819
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,850
"If I don't see you or hear you for a while"

820
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:25,440
"I feel like my heart doesn't have a beat."

821
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:29,290
"If you don't get angry on me,
if you don't scold me sweetly"

822
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,850
"I get a feel that my heart can't breathe."

823
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,660
"I feel hard even to stay at a place I like"

824
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:40,210
"I'm waiting to see you"

825
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:46,660
"Missing you so much I feel I'm getting
wings that pull me towards you."

826
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:50,950
"My world is flying"

827
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:54,720
"like a kite that cut it's thread".

828
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:58,390
"I'm just flying"

829
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,180
"Like the flight that
chose the destination."

830
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,900
- Boss!
- Boss!

831
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,160
- Your words came true.
- Which words boss?

832
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,790
What exists between me and Anu is love...

833
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:34,760
...and what exists between me
and Reethu is just friendship.

834
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,790
How did you say so correctly boss?

835
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,660
Are you busy boy?

836
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,250
Uncle, do you know something?

837
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:43,580
Our Ganesh is more powerful than the
famous sage Sri Pothuluri Veerabramhendra.

838
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,080
- Why?
- Whatever he says is coming true.

839
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:48,250
Good, very good! Keep it up!

840
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:55,040
I'll be back in a minute.

841
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:09,410
Let's go. Start it.

842
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,250
What are you looking at?

843
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,790
This is the house I built for Anu.

844
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:21,200
I mortgaged it for my friend. I should get
it released by the time of Anu's marriage.

845
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,870
My daughter will however not
stay with me after marriage.

846
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,620
Atleast if she stays in this house that I
built for her, I would feel I'm with her.

847
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:33,470
One minute.

848
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,410
Anu is calling.

849
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,910
Hello. Yes dear...

850
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,410
Why are you not coming to work since a week?
I got to know you are on sick leave.

851
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,090
They won't grant me leave if I say
to have fallen in love, would they?

852
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,180
So I did that.

853
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,000
Reethu resigned the job and
left as you rejected her love.

854
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,570
- 'Why are you crying?'
- You aren't here to inform you.

855
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:55,230
Wait, I'm coming right away.

856
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,410
- Oh no, okay I'll call again- Hello.

857
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,570
Exactly when the daughters grow
up and are ready for marriage,

858
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,080
these guys appear suddenly
on the name of love.

859
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,330
What happened uncle?

860
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:06,830
Someone is teasing Anu on the name of love.
She called me crying.

861
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,550
- Hey Anu wait.
- Let go!

862
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:11,650
Hey! Anu, I love you!

863
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:14,910
- Come, we'll go.
- Climb back.

864
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,620
Tell me dear,

865
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:36,140
Is there anyone who makes unwanted comments
on you either outside or in Facebook?

866
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:39,080
There's a guy named Raghu who is
behind me every day in the college.

867
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,370
A guy named Rajesh is passing
dirty comments in Facebook.

868
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,870
Hey stop man! Wait.

869
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,200
- Hi Karthik.
- Namasthe uncle. What a surprise?

870
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,830
- Please come in
- Come.

871
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,850
- I'll be with you in two minutes uncle
- Yeah, ok.

872
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,070
You be seated.

873
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:16,910
Mom! dad! Viswanath uncle is here.
Come fast.

874
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,160
Isn't the boy good?

875
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,620
He is Karthik, a colleague at my office.

876
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:32,660
I'm observing this guy since two years.
He's the best in all aspects.

877
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:38,790
Somehow, I felt he's perfect for Anu.

878
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,950
Shouldn't I give her the best in everything?

879
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:47,950
As I was about to ask, he asked me
himself that he wanted to marry Anu.

880
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:53,450
And, today I came to know because of
you that there's no one in Anu's heart!

881
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,240
That's why I came to say
okay to his proposal.

882
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,260
- Eh?
- Eh?

883
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:02,830
I mean, why's did you decide so suddenly?

884
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,910
He's leaving to America today.

885
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,040
I came to tell him my
decision before he leaves.

886
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:13,950
Oh! Here they come.

887
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,130
Namasthe everyone.

888
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:23,250
- Namasthe, please sit
- Are you fine Sir?

889
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:27,830
Did you ask Anu? What did she say uncle?

890
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:32,000
Actually,
I came to say we're ok for this match.

891
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:39,250
You should've informed a day in advance sir.
We would've had the engagement today.

892
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:42,120
Don't worry about the engagement dad.
I believe his word more than that.

893
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,580
I'm giving my word.
I'll get Anu married to you.

894
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:56,420
Good!

895
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,430
So my son would join the job there

896
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,240
setup a home with amenities
and come back in a month.

897
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,290
We'll have both engagement and
wedding at one go, once he's back.

898
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,410
Thanks sir.

899
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:05,790
- Thank you...
- Okay uncle.

900
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:06,440
See you sir.

901
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:08,220
Oh! You haven't had anything at our house.

902
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,660
It's not that I shouldn't.

903
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:13,890
They say devouring makes relations bad.

904
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,650
- So...
- As you say.

905
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,630
- Happy journey.
- Thank you uncle.

906
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:18,870
- See you
- Fine.

907
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,160
Come on...

908
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:23,540
Uncle, you didn't introduce him.

909
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,830
This boy is Sanju, my friend's son.

910
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,040
And now he's my friend.

911
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:46,510
One minute uncle.

912
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:29,550
DEVOURING MAKES RELATIONS BAD

913
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,660
Laxmi! Do you remember the
guy Karthik from our office?

914
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:46,780
Son of Mr. Prabhakar Rao.
He got a job in America.

915
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,920
I'd been to his place to talk to him.

916
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,870
I gave them a word without
informing you both.

917
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:52,740
And what's that?

918
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,620
To give Anu's hand to him in wedlock...

919
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:58,700
Why do you say such an
awesome news casually?

920
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:01,800
My dear girl! You know how good the boy is?

921
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,450
Even after having such a good
job and such a huge property

922
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,550
He treats everyone warmly with a smile.

923
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:10,120
- Were they actually interested in this?
- It was them who asked first.

924
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:11,060
Is it true?

925
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,660
Boy, what was the first question
Karthik asked after coming down?

926
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,990
Hey! Weren't you there too? Tell them.

927
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,450
He said "What did Anu say? Did she say ok?"

928
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:27,580
- What did his dad say when I agreed?
- Why not you say? You were there too!

929
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,410
They aren't believing me, so you tell them.

930
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,780
He said he would have the engagement
done today if you've agreed yesterday.

931
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,670
Will you believe now?

932
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:38,370
Finally, something good is happening
in this house because of your word.

933
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,370
Anu dear, come here. Sit.

934
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,240
See, I gave them my word without asking you.

935
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,620
I would've left it to your wish even if
you'd asked dad. Should you ask me again?

936
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:50,660
Karthik will take better
care of you than me.

937
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,490
I'm giving you the word and
I'm giving you the best.

938
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:06,080
Sanju, no one at home knows that I drink.

939
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,160
I drink only when I do something
like this for Anu or I feel happy.

940
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,740
To day I'm very Happy.

941
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:16,160
I gave the best teddy bear to Anu
and it was there for five years

942
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:19,660
I gave the best school for ten years.

943
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:22,200
I gave the best college and for four years.

944
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:28,530
And now I'm giving the best husband
and she'll have him life long.

945
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:34,490
Karthik is best for Anu.

946
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:36,870
He's the right one for Anu.

947
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,650
He's best for Anu. That's all.

948
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:46,530
Now Anu will get married, so what about you?

949
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:48,930
Hey...

950
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,620
You say yes and I'll get
the best for you too.

951
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,990
I won't get the best sir.
Her marriage is already fixed.

952
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,200
Is that love?

953
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,450
Is it at the village? Who's that girl?

954
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,740
Hey, who rejected you?

955
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,490
Sanju, the wedding is just
fixed but isn't done yet right?

956
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:06,510
Tell me who's that and I'll
go speak to her father.

957
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:08,030
As if he'll agree if you speak.

958
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:09,940
What's wrong with you?

959
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,740
You're good, have the best job,
great family...

960
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,200
A girl should be lucky to
be coming to your house.

961
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,930
Don't remind me of that uncle.

962
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,120
I'm already in great pain.

963
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,360
Say where did your love stop?

964
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,830
Aren't you a father of a girl too?
How can I tell you?

965
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:31,740
Why did you say that?
Did I treat you like that ever?

966
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:34,160
If I did,
would I send my daughter with you on bike?

967
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:35,530
How can you...

968
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,120
Look, what did I answer when they asked
me who are you at Karthik's place?

969
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,880
You said he is my friend's son
and is like a friend even to me.

970
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,740
Didn't I say that?

971
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:49,080
I'm a friend dude!
Share everything with this friend.

972
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,030
No uncle,
how can you think like my friend at your age?

973
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,080
What we feel right in our age wouldn't
be felt right for you in this age.

974
01:13:56,530 --> 01:14:00,080
Oh, I didn't cross your age ever!
I jumped over it and came here.

975
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:02,080
Be friends man.

976
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,990
Stop it uncle, what's a friendship with you?

977
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,910
How different are we?
How can I share my personals with you...

978
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,020
You go down stairs...

979
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,030
No, I won't talk to you, leave.

980
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,370
Okay I should be friends with you,
is that it?

981
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,290
Isn't it?

982
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:19,540
That's not so easy uncle.

983
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:20,660
Then go...

984
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,080
Oh God.

985
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,450
Ok, everyone says you won't
break your word once you give it.

986
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:32,150
So first give me a word to be
friends with me for a month.

987
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:33,790
Then I'll tell you my love story.

988
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:34,370
That's it.

989
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:41,780
Here, I promise to be a friend
with you for this month.

990
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:43,200
Okay now?

991
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:46,410
Tell me now, who is that girl?

992
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:02,280
Friend, I'm in love with Mr.
Viswanath's daughter Anu.

993
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:05,530
Neither Anu nor her parents know about this.

994
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:07,030
You are the first person
I'm telling this to.

995
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:12,780
By the time I realized I'm in love with Anu,
her dad fixed another match for her.

996
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,910
I don't know what to do now.

997
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,950
I know its wrong to love the daughter of
the person who let me stay at his home.

998
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,620
But I love her so intensely that I
can't let go even if I know, friend.

999
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,370
Her wedding is in a month...

1000
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:42,030
I gave a word to Karthik at their house that
I would marry Anu to him and you saw that.

1001
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,780
Karthik is a good boy and
will take good care of Anu.

1002
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,240
- How do you know uncle?
- I've observed him.

1003
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:53,990
How's he at the office, how he respects
elders, how he behaves with ladies...

1004
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:56,380
I've been observing
everyday since three years.

1005
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:57,410
Observe me too.

1006
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,080
Uncle, haven't you given a word that
you'd give only the best to Anu?

1007
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:02,370
Today I feel I'm the best for Anu.

1008
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:04,200
You too may feel the same tomorrow.

1009
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,990
If you get Anu married without observing me,
you'll not be giving the best to Anu, uncle

1010
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:10,320
You'd break your own word.

1011
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,370
Sanju, I don't like talking about this
with you anymore. You please leave.

1012
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:21,910
Earlier as a friend,
you said you would go and talk to her dad.

1013
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,330
Now as you're that dad,
you're asking me to leave.

1014
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:30,580
Why does something you felt right as a
friend look wrong to you as a father now?

1015
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:35,240
When I say I love with your daughter,
every dad reacts the same way.

1016
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,870
Because you just know the word 'in love'

1017
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,900
What more should one know?

1018
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,830
Uncle, do you know how tough is it for a
boy to make a girl fall in love with him?

1019
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:47,370
He should follow her every day,
should bear even when she hates him.

1020
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,160
He should wait for the whole day for
her to turn back and see just once.

1021
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:51,970
To make it short,

1022
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,520
we should show her the love you've
shown in 20 years within 2 to 3 months.

1023
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,870
Then if we get connected
to them at some point...

1024
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,880
if they get a feeling that can even
leave their family for this guy

1025
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,380
then they'll fall in love.

1026
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,080
Do you know who'll know all of this uncle?

1027
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,600
Just the friend.

1028
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:12,530
That's why they help to elope,
get beaten if caught and a few even die.

1029
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:14,060
Why?

1030
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,700
Because he has noticed
his friend's love closely.

1031
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:21,950
Uncle, I'll ask you just one thing.

1032
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:27,030
The way you were trying to be my friend,
be the same just for a month.

1033
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:28,770
Notice my love closely.

1034
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,530
It's good to be looking
at it from your angle.

1035
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:32,370
But Anu doesn't love you, does she?

1036
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,160
But she doesn't love Karthik either uncle.

1037
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,820
Is it ok if Anu loves me?

1038
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,890
Uncle,
you gave me a word to be friends with me.

1039
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:44,240
You gave a word to Anu to give her the best.

1040
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:45,780
That's why I'm telling you uncle.

1041
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,240
Travel with me as a
friend for just one month.

1042
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:52,280
You decide who is the best for Anu
among me and Karthik as a father.

1043
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,700
Either if you don't feel me the best or
if Anu doesn't love me in this month,

1044
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,780
I won't show myself to both
of you in my life again.

1045
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,320
Okay boy.

1046
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:11,780
I give you my word that I'll be
friends with you for a month.

1047
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:15,450
It's not because I gave
a word to you or Anu.

1048
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:19,170
As a father...

1049
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:25,090
I'm giving you my word to check if my
decision about my daughter is correct.

1050
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,290
Friendship accepted.

1051
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:32,710
Thanks uncle.

1052
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,480
Coffee.

1053
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,990
Anu, what're you doing for so long?
He is waiting there.

1054
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,930
I made drumstick curry and dal. I mixed
dal and kept rice and curry separately.

1055
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:02,370
I'll prepare rice sweet and
keep it ready if you come early.

1056
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,770
Mom, why are you so happy?

1057
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,620
You want me to prepare
anything else for dinner dear?

1058
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:09,910
Do something damn!

1059
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,870
Dad, why are you so tensed?

1060
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:13,120
Nothing dear.

1061
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:15,530
I'll leave to college dad.

1062
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,770
- Anu...
- Yeah.

1063
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,770
- I'll drop from today
- That's okay dad, we'll go.

1064
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:24,120
I'm telling you I'll drop you!
You say you'll go yourself.

1065
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,280
You should learn to listen
when I say something.

1066
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,740
Why do you get so angry for that?
Drop her yourself!

1067
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,100
Mom haven't you given
BP tablets today to dad?

1068
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,320
Uncle, Am I not taking Anu?
Why do you spoil everything?

1069
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,160
She's my daughter and it's my wish!
Who are you to ask me?

1070
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:55,910
Try to control yourself.

1071
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:59,450
Friend!

1072
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:05,280
Anu's father says he would drop her to
college from today. What shall we do?

1073
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,830
Can't you understand when I say it once?

1074
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:08,410
Tell me as a friend, not as a father.

1075
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:09,410
You gave me a word last night.

1076
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:11,280
Okay, I'll tell you as a friend.

1077
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:13,780
It's her father and he
is dropping his daughter.

1078
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,430
What can you and I do? Simple!

1079
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:18,990
Wow! How shamelessy are you breaking
the word you gave last night sir!

1080
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,770
There's good talk about you that
you do anything for your word.

1081
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,200
- So, it's all a blunder then.
- Hey...

1082
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,390
What else is this uncle?
Will any friend say this at this time?

1083
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,000
What will a friend do?
Tell me and I'll do that.

1084
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,120
Hello...

1085
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,040
- Hey dude.
- Yeah.

1086
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:37,050
Once he knew I love Anu, her father is
saying that he'll drop her to college daily.

1087
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:40,780
I should take Anu. If you were here,
tell me what would you do as a friend.

1088
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:41,740
What's the big deal?

1089
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,020
I'll ask you to make sure no
one in her family comes out,

1090
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,330
I'll go and puncture her dad's bike.
Then she'll automatically come with you.

1091
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:48,700
Wow...

1092
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:52,150
Oh no, what will her father do then?

1093
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:54,370
What great work does he have?
He'll take an auto or something else.

1094
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,620
Haven't you said you'd
do what a friend does?

1095
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,990
- Hey, this is...
- You gave me a word.

1096
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:05,860
Hey, it's not right that I
puncture my own vehicle dude!

1097
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:06,990
You go soon friend,
she'll get late otherwise.

1098
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,870
New ringtone, I set it in the morning
thinking you'd connect with it.

1099
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:28,570
She's coming

1100
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,020
Shall we go?

1101
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,410
Dad says he would drop me from today.

1102
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:36,260
Aaw... whatever uncle says.

1103
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:39,250
We should listen to elders.
You take her uncle, I'll leave

1104
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,780
Oh no, it's punctured...

1105
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:49,490
Oh no, that's bad. What shall we do now?

1106
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,410
You take her.

1107
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:54,490
But how will you go uncle?

1108
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:56,990
What great work do I have?
I'll take some auto.

1109
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,700
Won't you drop her again from tomorrow?

1110
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,160
How can I puncture my bike daily?

1111
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,610
What dad?

1112
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:09,450
Nothing dear, you leave before you're late.

1113
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:14,830
Came to know your air is down sir?

1114
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,030
How do you know?

1115
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:17,840
Your air is down just now,
mine was long back.

1116
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,350
Are you okay both of them are
travelling together daily?

1117
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:21,190
What're you talking?

1118
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,420
They both are friends

1119
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,320
- Are they friends for sure?
- What do you mean?

1120
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,990
Is it the front tyre in
which the air is down?

1121
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:46,630
Hello, can't you hear the phone is ringing?

1122
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,900
Hello!
Didn't I say I'd be busy at the office?

1123
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:53,320
Why do you always disturb?

1124
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:07,900
Hello, don't always tell us.
Your phone is ringing, look into that.

1125
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:13,150
- Hello.
- Uncle.

1126
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:17,420
Are you playing with my weakness of
doing anything for the word I gave?

1127
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,640
Are you teasing me even after knowing
that I've fixed Anu's marriage?

1128
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,540
Uncle, it's useful to me if I impress
you but what'll I get by teasing you?

1129
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:27,300
As you are thinking like a father...

1130
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:28,910
...you feel that I'm teasing you.

1131
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,320
But if you think as a friend,

1132
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,330
you'd ask, "Would you do anything
just to go out with Anu?"?

1133
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:38,270
Uncle, I want to be very sincere with
you in regards to our friendship.

1134
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,500
Ok, what shall I do now?

1135
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:46,020
Actually... I wish to see Anu.
I want to take her to lunch.

1136
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,580
I'll kill you!

1137
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,960
Sorry, it's my friend.

1138
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:54,750
Hey man! You created such a havoc
and took her in the morning.

1139
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:56,290
Can't you wait till she
comes back in the evening?

1140
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,080
Oh!

1141
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:01,720
You want me to feel that he can't stay
without seeing Anu just for some time too

1142
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,940
and that he loves Anu so much! Isn't it?

1143
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:07,070
Don't you think it is a bit too much?

1144
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:10,410
When Anu was born, after you left to work
after playing with her in the morning...

1145
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,620
...knowing that you would return
home anyways in the evening

1146
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:14,780
...didn't you ever go back home
at lunch just for seeing her?

1147
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:19,920
When it's love that made you want to see her,
how can my wish be too much uncle?

1148
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,060
I feel like seeing Anu, friend.

1149
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:26,360
When I just called Anu and asked to
meet for lunch, she said has to ask dad.

1150
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:27,460
Ok...

1151
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,080
Tell me what shall I do now?

1152
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:32,790
Simple friend,
call Anu and tell her to go with Sanju.

1153
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:57,920
Shall we go?

1154
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,710
You book the table dear, we'll come.

1155
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:00,540
Ok dad.

1156
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:08,580
As you said, I called her to tell
her to go with you as your friend

1157
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,960
and I came here as a father
when she asked me to join.

1158
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:14,540
How it's my responsibility
to support you as a friend,

1159
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:18,200
isn't it my responsibility to
safeguard my daughter as a father too?

1160
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,210
Dad!

1161
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:22,320
Daughter is calling.

1162
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:40,580
Excuse me, take the order.

1163
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:41,710
- Tell me, ma'am.
-3 Soups.

1164
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:42,400
Okay.

1165
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,710
1 Chicken Biryani and 2 Veg Biryanis.

1166
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:45,390
Ok madam.

1167
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:47,710
Dad, I'll go to the wash room and come.

1168
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,040
Ok dear.
- Okay.

1169
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,250
I came to talk personally with
Anu and you you are here...

1170
01:25:57,790 --> 01:25:58,190
Why?

1171
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:01,720
If she has called me, doesn't it mean
she doesn't like to be alone with you?

1172
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,100
Tell me as a friend, not as a father.

1173
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:06,280
What can any friend do when
the girl don't like it?

1174
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:07,520
It's your bad luck.

1175
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:16,710
Hey dude, when you, me and my girlfriend
come for lunch at a restaurant...

1176
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:19,550
and I feel like talking to her personally,
what'd you do as a friend?

1177
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,850
What's in that?
I'll go out saying I got a call.

1178
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:25,040
You both will talk and I'll come
back once you give me a ring.

1179
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:27,630
- You said you're a friend...
- It's not right!

1180
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:29,040
She's coming.

1181
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,210
Dad, who's on the phone?

1182
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:48,920
- It's a friend maybe.
- Yes dear.

1183
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:50,720
A new.

1184
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:52,930
He is such a pain,
I'll talk to him and come.

1185
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:16,250
What happened?

1186
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:17,750
I read a joke on Facebook.

1187
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,110
You look great when you smile.

1188
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,390
Even dad says the same.

1189
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:23,390
Leave dad aside, anyone should say the same.

1190
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:24,590
Because it's a fact.

1191
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:27,920
The dress is good.

1192
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,500
Dad selected it.

1193
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,870
- The hotel is good.
- I came here with dad first.

1194
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,300
You chant dad's name for everything.

1195
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:39,000
Dad bought this, dad said that.
I'm dying with this protective dad stories.

1196
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,210
Ain't dad the boyfriend for
any girl till she gets married?

1197
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:50,170
Shopping, films,
holidays and everything is with him.

1198
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:54,840
After marriage, a girl's life turns
beautiful because she becomes a mother.

1199
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:59,250
Before marriage, a girl's life
is beautiful because of her dad.

1200
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:03,420
All this crap is good just to listen.

1201
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:05,550
But

1202
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:10,630
It's only the lover who risks even his
life to save a girl when she has a problem.

1203
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:13,860
That's true!

1204
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,750
The guy who saves a girl when she
is in a problem is called a lover.

1205
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:22,540
But the one who makes sure she never
gets into a problem is called dad.

1206
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,420
I'm unable to bear this dad felicitation.
Please come to eat.

1207
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,120
What's your friend saying?

1208
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:50,380
Well... he started a business even
when I said no, and is repenting now.

1209
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:52,800
- What business dad?
- Cotton business.

1210
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:54,720
He trades cotton.

1211
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:58,000
He started it paying no heed to warnings.
So he is now crying without a break.

1212
01:28:58,230 --> 01:29:00,830
- Shall we eat before it gets dry?
- Didn't you have enough already?

1213
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:01,830
Sorry sir!

1214
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:40,570
Psst psst...

1215
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:10,590
Hey, what were you doing there?

1216
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:12,500
Try to woo her, friend.

1217
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,630
Yeah, didn't I notice it in the morning?

1218
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:17,620
She said she wouldn't come without me.

1219
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:19,820
She spoke about me in my absence.

1220
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,690
Hello, she isn't such a girl.

1221
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:26,540
Still, you couldn't do anything with
so much time in hand in the morning.

1222
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:29,170
What'll you do now after she
came back tired from the college?

1223
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:32,440
You ask me what can we do at this time?
Come closer.

1224
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:36,330
When the girls return at 6 in the
evening either from college or office,

1225
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:39,030
they talk to her parents for an hour,
watch TV for another

1226
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:40,220
and after eating for sometime...

1227
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:45,330
They go into their room at 9 in the
night and sleep at about 12 in the night.

1228
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:49,920
This time of 3 hours in between
is called the golden time.

1229
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,210
80% of the Indian girls go flat in this time.
Why do you ask what can we do?

1230
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,150
Heck,
you are in this room and she's in there

1231
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:02,540
both can't see each other.
I'm asking you what can you do?

1232
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:07,460
Mark Zuckerberg, a great man has invented
Facebook to woo even a girl abroad.

1233
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:09,580
Is it a challenge to woo
a girl in the next room?

1234
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:12,670
I just put a friend request in Facebook.

1235
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,630
Why did she put up this idiotic pic
keeping so many good pics aside?

1236
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:21,500
Hey!

1237
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:26,210
It's been an hour since I sent a friend
request. Why didn't she accept yet?

1238
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:29,850
She won't accept...

1239
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,170
Hi Anu.

1240
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,000
She won't reply.

1241
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:46,120
You look good in the profile pic.

1242
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:50,460
Hey, you just said it's not good.
Don't you have any shame to be lying?

1243
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:55,150
I don't know if girls are born because
of lying but they sure fall for lies.

1244
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,570
Keep seeing...

1245
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,380
I'll get lot of smiles
along with a thank you...

1246
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:04,040
Sanju...

1247
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:07,040
What are these messages
now like never before?

1248
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,950
If you want to talk something,
come into the hall and do it.

1249
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:11,600
Don't disturb me at the time of
my studies with your messages.

1250
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,080
Friend!

1251
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,500
Why now?

1252
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:29,200
The one who boozes in the happiness of doing
something for a daughter is called a father.

1253
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:33,570
And the one who boozes in pain that
his love is rejected is called lover.

1254
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:36,380
Ok, what do I have to do with this?

1255
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:40,560
A person who gives company to a guy boozing
in the gloom of his lover's dejection...

1256
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:41,740
...is called a friend. Come.

1257
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,690
Eh? My ill fate.

1258
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,170
Sir...

1259
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,510
What are you doing on
the terrace at this time?

1260
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:00,940
We are friends and we'll have a
hundred things. What's your problem?

1261
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:02,730
Are you clear about being friends?

1262
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:04,090
Why, do you have any doubt?

1263
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:06,580
Nothing,
earlier you said they both are friends

1264
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,280
now you say you both are friends.

1265
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,310
I doubt if we both become friends tomorrow.

1266
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:12,210
Hey. Get lost you!

1267
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,250
You are unable to understand your future.

1268
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:16,370
When I say to have understood,
you don't understand.

1269
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:17,670
Your bad luck...

1270
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:23,210
Sanju, after you started loving Anu,
I liked her a lot.

1271
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:27,790
How much ever you're trying, she isn't
even looking at you and I feel so proud.

1272
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,930
If you hadn't made me agree to be friends,

1273
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:33,530
I wouldn't have realised
my daughter's strength

1274
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:35,380
Thank you for the friendship

1275
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:39,500
So you say it helped you
by being friends with me.

1276
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:40,530
Yes.

1277
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,040
You say you got all the help.

1278
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:43,040
Yes.

1279
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,020
- So you say it didn't help me at all?
- Yea...

1280
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:50,540
When it's only you who got the help,
then help me now.

1281
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:56,500
Now it's clear that Anu won't love you.
Ask me, what help u need?

1282
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:00,930
Give me an idea to make Anu love me.

1283
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:03,130
Hey, me?

1284
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:06,500
Don't over act as a father.
But give me a plan of action as a friend

1285
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:19,250
Yeah... send her flowers daily dude,
she'll fall flat.

1286
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:20,120
She'll be yours.

1287
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:21,900
What, flowers?

1288
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,790
Is she starting any flower shop?

1289
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:27,020
Hey,
not for the shop but to decorate the hair.

1290
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:31,500
Oh no. She's not someone to fall
for flowers or whistles, friend.

1291
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:33,170
She's a high end girl.

1292
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:36,500
Stop these dried out ideas
and give me a fresh idea.

1293
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:37,250
Okay.

1294
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:57,170
The coke tins she emptied,
hair pins she used

1295
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,640
Thrown away chocolate
wrappers and Ice fruit sticks.

1296
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,330
Store them carefully boy.

1297
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:07,670
To maintain this love lifelong, I have to
make the house a Municipality dump yard.

1298
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,250
So, say another idea friend.

1299
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:23,130
"Break 101 coconuts in the
temple pleading for her to love."

1300
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:27,220
"With that my friend,
your life would settle down."

1301
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:31,460
"If I break 101 coconuts,
the shop owner would settle down."

1302
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:36,000
"My life would be ruined for
sure if I folow your idea."

1303
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,210
"Hey friend, your idea is a dead end."

1304
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:44,260
"Hey friend, change your trend a bit."

1305
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:48,750
"Atleast protect the oil lamp with both
the hands when she is watching you."

1306
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:50,830
"She'll get connected to you automatically."

1307
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:56,130
"Isn't LIC already there to do that?
To hell with your idea."

1308
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:57,170
"Damn!"

1309
01:35:57,390 --> 01:36:01,130
"Hey friend, your idea is a dead end."

1310
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:05,540
"Hey friend, change your trend a bit."

1311
01:36:14,130 --> 01:36:18,290
"Write a poem describing her,
any girl would fall for it."

1312
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:19,330
"This is good..."

1313
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:22,130
"Anu, I love you as dearly as my life."

1314
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:26,670
Friend, how do I spell that?

1315
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,000
Write as your wish.

1316
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,420
"Girls like the sense of humor in boys,
my friend"

1317
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:37,250
"My foot... if that's so, there'd be
no better lover boy than our Brahmi"

1318
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:41,210
"Hey friend, your idea is a dead end."

1319
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:45,630
"Hey friend, change your trend a bit."

1320
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:02,250
"Try arranging hired goons
and you go hit them yourself."

1321
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:06,460
"The reaction would make you
the best guy in the world."

1322
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:07,730
"How much would be the charge?"

1323
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,250
"I don't have an idea,
this is the first time"

1324
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:13,920
"No, how much would you charge
for not giving such ideas?"

1325
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:15,960
I got it.

1326
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,170
"Hey friend, your idea is a dead end."

1327
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:24,500
"Hey friend, change your trend a bit."

1328
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:28,420
"Try threatening her once to
jump off the cell phone tower."

1329
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:32,790
"The babe would come running saying
who else would she love than you."

1330
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,130
"Yes, I too feel like jumping"

1331
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:37,330
"You can't reject this idea of mine."

1332
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:41,330
"I feel like jumping and dying unable
to listen to these worthless ideas."

1333
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:42,780
That's mine.. I got it.

1334
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:47,830
This is not the right way.
First Anu should know that I love her.

1335
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,200
What?

1336
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:51,750
Would you open up?

1337
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:54,420
Whatever destined would happen now.
I'll open up.

1338
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,250
Hey!

1339
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,150
Sorry...

1340
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,040
I got to speak to you for two minutes Anu.

1341
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:13,700
About what?

1342
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,240
I was sleepless for the whole night.

1343
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,790
So, please don't mind if I don't make sense.

1344
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:21,120
But about what?

1345
01:38:21,530 --> 01:38:23,200
Don't interrupt me for just two minutes Anu.

1346
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:24,130
Hmmm...

1347
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:27,570
I love you Anu.

1348
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:34,920
- Didn't we decide to be just friends?
- We did and I remember that.

1349
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:39,000
My anger towards you in the train turned
into friendship once I reached your home.

1350
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,990
We've been in the same house for so
many days, wouldn't it turn into love?

1351
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,250
I don't know if it's a
mistake that I'm in love.

1352
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:50,420
But it's not a mistake that I loved you.
Because anyone will like you.

1353
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,500
There are 760 crore people on this earth.

1354
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:56,700
You might be acquainted with
about 4000 of them by now.

1355
01:38:57,530 --> 01:39:00,180
You would've studied with a 1000 of
them and have 50 of them as friends.

1356
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,500
And 20 from them would definitely like you.

1357
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:06,880
At the most, 10 of them would dare to
come to you and propose their love.

1358
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:09,210
When they come to you like that,

1359
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:12,100
if you have to say, "I'm sorry,
I have someone in my heart".

1360
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,370
"and he is the love of my life"

1361
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:18,960
I wish to be that one person, Anu

1362
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,580
Actually, I said what I wanted
to say two minutes back.

1363
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:29,830
But I'm saying all of this with the fear
that you may say no if I stop talking.

1364
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,790
I'll stop this and say
I love you once again.

1365
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:37,140
Will you please say no?

1366
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:42,450
I love you Anu.

1367
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:46,410
No.

1368
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:52,430
You said no as I asked you to. Else I've
the confidence that you'd have said yes.

1369
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:57,760
Till you feel like saying yes by yourself,
keep saying no whenever I ask you.

1370
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,670
Don't let dad know about this.

1371
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:08,160
He believed you a lot.

1372
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:31,780
Why are you sitting like a
girl who lost her husband?

1373
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,070
Change it dude,
I'm unable to bear the sight of it.

1374
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:37,820
What's the problem now? Anu rejected you.

1375
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,860
Didn't you go to her knowing
that she'd reject you?

1376
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,490
Oh! So..

1377
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:50,620
I should feel that you love
her a lot as you turned so sad.

1378
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,150
Isn't that the expression about?

1379
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,610
Enough, sleep now.

1380
01:40:58,530 --> 01:40:59,320
Anu's message.

1381
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:03,330
She might have asked you to flee from
here before people are up in the house.

1382
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,460
So that people are saved
from seeing your dirty face.

1383
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:09,950
We'll go out at 3 am
once everyone is asleep.

1384
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,520
- What?
- Will you come without dad's knowledge?

1385
01:41:13,490 --> 01:41:15,110
I'll tell you why, once we meet.

1386
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:23,110
I'll be waiting without
sleep for 3. Don't miss this.

1387
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,990
Is it that, Anu knew about your presence
when I proposed to her in the morning?

1388
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:35,110
So maybe she rejected me then to
propose me when no one was around?

1389
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:37,560
- Huh?
- Yes!

1390
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:46,030
It's personal

1391
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:53,440
The reason why you're sitting that way

1392
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,450
is the very reason why I
was sitting so from morning.

1393
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:58,530
We get into a state of shock
when girls reject us...

1394
01:41:58,930 --> 01:42:00,060
...and you get into a state of
shock if they respond positively.

1395
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:01,850
Uncle, your love and our love are alike.

1396
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:04,500
But we fail to understand
why they both collide.

1397
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:09,770
- Aren't you coming?
- No.

1398
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:11,040
Good choice!

1399
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:15,930
Oh, it's night effect.

1400
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:21,840
She said let's meet once everyone is asleep.
She said she would. wait without sleeping

1401
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:25,200
- I'm happy seeing that light.
- I'm dying here.

1402
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:29,490
Hey, she asked you to meet at 3 am,
the time is 11 now.

1403
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:31,850
Why not wake up at 3 instead of over acting?

1404
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:34,630
- What if I can't wake up?
- You should set the alarm

1405
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:35,530
What if I fail to hear it?

1406
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,150
Am I not here as your friend?
I'll wake you up.

1407
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:38,700
What if the father in you wakes up first?

1408
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:39,780
Don't you believe me?

1409
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,640
Anyway, she asked me to meet for the
first time, that too at such a wee hour.

1410
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,580
How would I get sleep in this excitement?

1411
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:48,240
Oh! I got you man.

1412
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:53,740
Shouldn't I feel that you love Anu a lot
as he is waiting at this hour of the night?

1413
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:56,650
It's the generation gap, easy on it.

1414
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,060
Oh no, why is the time running so slow?

1415
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:01,530
Why is she moving so fast in this time?

1416
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:08,820
I'll take a small nap.

1417
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:09,930
You!

1418
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,750
What a treat is it when a girl we love jumps
over the wall for us in front of our eyes?

1419
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:30,700
You know how painful it is when daughter
jumps over the wall in front of dad's eyes?

1420
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:34,870
Okay she's coming, you hide somewhere.

1421
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:39,820
Go and hide there, not here.

1422
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:48,960
- Did anyone notice us?
- No way.

1423
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:51,240
Thank God! It's the first time, you know...

1424
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:52,940
- Me too.
- Okay start now.

1425
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:54,900
Where to?

1426
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:56,400
Start fast!

1427
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:07,860
- Auto!
- Yeah!

1428
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:10,520
- Hey auto! Stop...
- Yeah it did stop.

1429
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:13,150
- Go now.
- Where to?

1430
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:14,150
We should go behind them.

1431
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:15,690
- And where are they headed?
- I don't know that.

1432
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:17,780
- How will we go if we don't know that?
- Hey, you start it man...

1433
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,950
- Go, follow that bike...
- Okay.

1434
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,070
- Sir.
- Yes.

1435
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,400
- Is that boy your son?
- No.

1436
01:44:27,030 --> 01:44:28,780
- Oh, is that girl your daughter?
- Yeah.

1437
01:44:29,110 --> 01:44:30,880
- So what's the use? I'll turn back.
- Whats wrong with you man!

1438
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:31,860
- Keep going!
- Okay sir.

1439
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:33,030
- Sir.
- Yeah.

1440
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:35,280
- Shall I tell you something?
- What?

1441
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:39,570
As long as girls follow their dad's word,
boys follow girls.

1442
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:44,490
Once, girls start following boys,
dads will follow the girls like this.

1443
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:46,720
You idiot, I'll kill you.
Shut up and follow them

1444
01:44:58,650 --> 01:44:59,290
- Bye.
- Hey.

1445
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:02,330
What's it Sanju?

1446
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:04,610
Mom?

1447
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:07,610
- Hi Anu.
- Hi aunty!

1448
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,530
Tomorrow is dad's birthday.

1449
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:11,960
The day you came to Hyderabad...

1450
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:15,020
...wasn't dad telling aunty that
he was missing all his friends?

1451
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:19,820
That's why, I called all of them to
surprise dad when he wakes up tomorrow.

1452
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:23,580
He is Rajarshi and he is Sundaram.

1453
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:45,300
Dad... Happy birthday to you!

1454
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:48,650
Happy birthday to you...

1455
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:52,960
Hey, Anoop, Malini, Gopi, Gayatri...
how come all of you are here?

1456
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:55,070
- Surprise.
- Surprise?

1457
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:58,860
Yes, I'm surprised. What a surprise?

1458
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:03,550
- Anu planned it to surprise you
- Thank you

1459
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,490
Get ready fast... you have to cut the cake.

1460
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,130
- Get ready
- Ok.

1461
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:09,110
- Anu.
- Yeah dad?

1462
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,700
Thanks dear, it's my best birthday.

1463
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:13,240
Fresh up and come, dad.

1464
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:26,570
Why sport a fake surprise knowing that
all the friends had come in the night?

1465
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:29,650
That's for the happiness of my daughter.

1466
01:46:30,570 --> 01:46:33,400
When your lies to keep your
daughter happy are part of love

1467
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:38,650
isn't me lying to my lover that she looks
good in her profile pic a part of love too?

1468
01:46:41,740 --> 01:46:42,510
To hell with your logics..

1469
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:47,200
Happy birthday to you

1470
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:50,240
Happy birthday to you...

1471
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,240
An annoucement please.

1472
01:47:01,820 --> 01:47:05,230
My daughter's wedding is on the 5th next
month and there are just 10 days left.

1473
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:07,990
Hello!

1474
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:13,200
Don't think that you have visited me now so
it's okay to skip it, please don't skip it.

1475
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:16,520
Viswa, are you doing the love
marriage or the arranged marriage?

1476
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:17,680
That is not decide yet.

1477
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:19,620
- Phone.
- Oh.

1478
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,490
You didn't say yet,
is it a love marriage or an arranged one?

1479
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,440
It's an arranged marriage.

1480
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:28,030
But I'll go for a love marriage.

1481
01:47:29,490 --> 01:47:30,070
Just saying...

1482
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:34,450
Sanju, are you in love? In this city?

1483
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,200
Did the girl accept your love son?

1484
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:40,070
You say yes and Viswa will go, talk to them.

1485
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:41,550
- Huh?
- Me?

1486
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:42,900
Mom...

1487
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:48,320
Where do you find dads who think about
it when a guy loves their daughter?

1488
01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:51,070
That's why, Viswa will go and talk.

1489
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,620
What will he talk with them now? Leave it.

1490
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:54,760
Come on son...

1491
01:47:55,150 --> 01:47:58,950
I was by Viswa at the time of his wedding.
Can't he support my son's wedding?

1492
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:03,190
Hello, your friend was saying something?

1493
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:06,820
Yeah, she told me to go to that girl's
house and discuss about your wedding.

1494
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:08,780
Tell us the girl's name.

1495
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,450
- Let's leave the topic here.
- Why not?

1496
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,360
Aren't you both in love?
Tell us where is her house?

1497
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,520
Why are you forcing me?

1498
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:18,780
Come on, when you don't feel shy to love
her, why feel shy to reveal her name?

1499
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:20,310
- Why is he forcing me mom?
- Come on, tell her name

1500
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:21,650
Ask him to say

1501
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:22,610
- Say it son.
- Tell him to.

1502
01:48:22,810 --> 01:48:23,800
What can I say if you force me?

1503
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:27,170
I said I'd go for a love marriage,
but never said I'm in love.

1504
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:29,950
What's the beep discussion about?

1505
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:32,280
That isn't beep but deep.

1506
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:33,780
Mom doesn't know English.

1507
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:37,530
All of you please come down and have dinner.

1508
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,740
Let's eat fast and sleep.
We should start early in the morning, right?

1509
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:43,110
You should attend Anu's
marriage without fail.

1510
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:44,950
Would you get Anu married in my absence?

1511
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:48,910
After the wedding, bring the girl and
son in law for Sriramanavami festival.

1512
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,030
I'll come

1513
01:48:50,070 --> 01:48:50,740
You keep saying so

1514
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:52,100
I gave a word! So I will come.

1515
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:53,780
Okay.

1516
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:57,860
I am going to office...
I'll have the lunch at out.

1517
01:48:57,950 --> 01:49:00,070
Let's do some shopping in the evening.

1518
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:01,070
Okay.

1519
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,240
Did you see?

1520
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:27,680
It's for you.

1521
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,030
The coffee.

1522
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,650
Oh...

1523
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:43,730
I thought you meant the saree.

1524
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:47,740
Oh... How is it?

1525
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:51,990
It's hot.

1526
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:54,700
The coffee.

1527
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:58,940
Looks like there's no one at home.

1528
01:49:59,140 --> 01:49:59,860
Yes.

1529
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:04,450
Wow, it is great if it's like this daily.

1530
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,700
I meant the coffee.

1531
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,140
"I tied a knot making her dad fall for it"

1532
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:30,150
"I impressed her mom and
tied the second knot."

1533
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:33,060
"I'll tie the third knot if you say yes"

1534
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,060
"and do the job of saying
yes for everything."

1535
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:41,980
Hello boss, I built the love kingdom
in my heart for the sake of love.

1536
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,190
"Maybe my dad fell for your flatter."

1537
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:54,270
"Maybe my mom said ok falling for your hype"

1538
01:50:54,700 --> 01:51:00,030
"I'm the important one here
and I won't fall as easily."

1539
01:51:00,450 --> 01:51:06,160
"You can't sweetly say 'Hello boss,
it's for love' and cheat me"

1540
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:02,150
"Jasmines guaranteed at the day end."

1541
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:05,190
"A film is guaranteed at the weekend."

1542
01:52:05,610 --> 01:52:08,050
"A salary packet every month end."

1543
01:52:08,610 --> 01:52:11,260
"A pair of saree and
blouse for every festival."

1544
01:52:11,530 --> 01:52:14,290
"Life goes on a mortgage
for your bunch of jasmines."

1545
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:17,250
"The movie goes silent with your whistles."

1546
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:20,150
"My life which is like a festival everyday."

1547
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:23,230
"Would become nil in your hands."

1548
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:26,210
"I'll write our story and make a film."

1549
01:52:26,610 --> 01:52:29,190
"I'll prove that my love is a super hit."

1550
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:34,580
"I'll see your film,
write a review and give the rating too."

1551
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:41,050
"Hello boss, I built the love kingdom
in my heart for the sake of love."

1552
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:47,110
"You can't sweetly say 'Hello boss,
it's for love' and cheat me"

1553
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:04,450
Put me down.

1554
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:07,910
Don't you think it's a bit awkward?

1555
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,280
It's my imagination babe!

1556
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:13,480
Please come in. We met at the
shopping unexpectedly. Please come

1557
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:15,900
I asked them to come home as we met anyway.

1558
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:18,370
She looks beautiful. Come, be seated dear.

1559
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:21,950
Your aunt is so missing you.

1560
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:23,850
Even our son wants to talk with you.

1561
01:53:24,390 --> 01:53:26,530
We said we'd come home
thinking it's good both ways.

1562
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,700
Shall I call him, will you talk?

1563
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:31,170
Please go ahead.

1564
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:33,160
- Hello.
- Yeah mom.

1565
01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:34,780
Here...

1566
01:53:37,780 --> 01:53:38,290
Hello..

1567
01:53:38,490 --> 01:53:39,610
Hey Anu, how are you?

1568
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,610
That's okay girl, go and talk inside.

1569
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:43,400
Go.

1570
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,780
What else brother in law?
How did the shopping go?

1571
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:50,990
Well we just bought the engagement rings...

1572
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,530
But we are tensed if that
suits the boy or not.

1573
01:53:53,730 --> 01:53:54,990
Well that maybe manageable.

1574
01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:57,900
How could that be?
He should wear it and go around right?

1575
01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:00,450
In that case test it on your friend.

1576
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,430
He's your friend anyways.

1577
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:07,990
No problem, we shall see after he's back

1578
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:10,900
It's okay, he's your friend.
Your doubt would be cleared too.

1579
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:13,240
No problem brother, check it.

1580
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:14,820
Laxmi

1581
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:19,700
Here it is.

1582
01:54:31,570 --> 01:54:32,340
Isn't it looking good?

1583
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,780
It's good on your friend,
so it would be great on my brother then.

1584
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:47,400
Is it not coming out?

1585
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:49,200
It'll come.

1586
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:55,530
Don't use force to take it out.
Isn't your friend in pain?

1587
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:02,990
Sanju...

1588
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,450
Leave this here, Sanju.

1589
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,030
Not as a father but...

1590
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:05,320
I am telling you as a
friend for the first time.

1591
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:09,900
What can either a father or friend
do when Anu has no love on you?

1592
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:13,900
Anu is ready for this marriage at her will.

1593
01:56:15,110 --> 01:56:16,490
Don't disturb her heart at this time.

1594
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:19,450
- What if you go and say Sanju really...
- Sanju...

1595
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:22,780
I just gave the word to be friends with you.

1596
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:26,070
But I gave them word to give my
daughter to them in marriage.

1597
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:29,320
You know about me. Good night.

1598
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:36,820
Anu texted me.

1599
01:56:38,150 --> 01:56:41,030
We both shall go out at 1 in the
midnight once all are asleep.

1600
01:56:41,450 --> 01:56:42,700
Don't let dad know this.

1601
01:56:42,950 --> 01:56:44,400
My brother is coming in the morning.

1602
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:47,240
I think she's planned to
surprise me when I wake up

1603
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:51,360
I won't come, you go.
You'll say I'm acting later.

1604
01:56:56,590 --> 01:56:57,960
Isn't it time for uncle's train?

1605
01:56:58,380 --> 01:56:59,710
I need to talk to you for two minutes.

1606
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:02,630
About what?

1607
01:57:04,590 --> 01:57:06,130
I'm sleepless since a few days.

1608
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:09,090
So, please don't mind if I don't make sense.

1609
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,300
- What's it about, Anu?
- Two minutes

1610
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:21,380
I love you Sanju

1611
01:57:25,130 --> 01:57:27,340
Take me somewhere and marry me.

1612
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:30,000
Come on Anu, don't make fun.

1613
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:31,420
Sanju.

1614
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:36,920
How can you love me Anu?

1615
01:57:38,210 --> 01:57:40,130
I didn't notice even once that
you were in love with me...

1616
01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:42,050
Don't interrupt me.

1617
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:46,420
You gave coffee beans that
day and spoke about your dad.

1618
01:57:47,710 --> 01:57:49,880
I felt that our characters
are the same about a father.

1619
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:51,170
So I said we are friends.

1620
01:57:52,540 --> 01:57:55,350
But when I was jealous that
some girl came home for you...

1621
01:57:55,550 --> 01:57:57,970
...and switched off my phone and sat
in the library that I came to know

1622
01:57:58,630 --> 01:57:59,890
that I'm in love with you.

1623
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:04,710
When I said a guy was teasing me,
you chased down and hit everybody.

1624
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,750
Didn't you notice the love in
my eyes when I opened the door?

1625
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:16,210
When dad said the match was finalized,
I looked at you.

1626
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:21,050
As you didn't say anything,
I said it's dad's wish.

1627
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:24,920
Wasn't I angry on dad as he
wasn't allowing me to go with you?

1628
01:58:26,090 --> 01:58:29,380
Didn't I come before anyone else and
waited as I wanted to have lunch with you?

1629
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:33,380
Isn't for you that I daily hold
the book and sit before you.

1630
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:37,920
When you messaged, I shouted on you as I
felt dad might see it as he was in the room?

1631
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:42,920
Why was I so eager to show
you that I wore a sari?

1632
01:58:44,090 --> 01:58:47,920
Why did I take out the ring bought for
Karthik when they were testing on you?

1633
01:58:48,380 --> 01:58:49,920
Isn't that because you were feeling bad?

1634
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:56,090
When there's love as close as breath,
how can you not notice it?

1635
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,730
Let' get married, Sanju

1636
01:59:34,570 --> 01:59:35,300
No.

1637
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:49,490
Why didn't you tell me till now that
you loved me so much? Crazy girl!

1638
01:59:49,690 --> 01:59:52,460
I thought to get married just
for dad and didn't tell you.

1639
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:55,300
But when I was talking to Karthik earlier,

1640
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:00,050
I felt like someone placed their hands
on my body without my permission.

1641
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:06,910
What do I do? You are in me.

1642
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:11,920
That's why I'm saying,
take me somewhere and marry me.

1643
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:16,920
Anu, don't get tensed.

1644
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:18,710
I'll talk to uncle and convince him.

1645
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,550
Tell me something.

1646
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:24,630
Dad gave them a word that
he'd marry me to Karthik.

1647
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:27,960
Do you think,
he'll break that word and marry me to you?

1648
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:30,920
You are the best one for me Sanju.

1649
02:00:31,630 --> 02:00:33,630
Even dad wishes to give me
the best guy in marriage.

1650
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:37,460
But this isn't the time he can
understand even if I say that's you.

1651
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:39,250
There are two mistakes before us.

1652
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:43,590
One, if I wed the one dad likes,
dad will be happy till the wedding is done.

1653
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:46,750
But once dad gets to know I am
not happy after the wedding...

1654
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:48,550
...even dad wouldn't be
happy throughtout his life.

1655
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:51,460
Second, if I marry the one I like,

1656
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,550
dad won't be happy till the wedding is done.

1657
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:58,420
But seeing me happy after the wedding,
he too will be happy for lifelong.

1658
02:01:00,590 --> 02:01:02,460
I feel this mistake is better among the two.

1659
02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:09,080
Take me somewhere and marry me. Please...

1660
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:30,460
Why did she call you?

1661
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:33,220
Is it to receive my brother?

1662
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:35,700
Didn't I tell you already?

1663
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,570
Haven't you slept yet?

1664
02:01:38,670 --> 02:01:40,250
It looks easy...

1665
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:45,000
but which father can sleep with engagement
in two days and wedding in a week ahead?

1666
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:49,460
I'm checking out Anu's childhood album,
it's a strange feeling.

1667
02:01:52,990 --> 02:01:57,920
Should I be with her for the whole week, as
she's getting married and leaving in a week?

1668
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:03,710
Maybe she won't leave me and go,
if I get too close.

1669
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:11,630
Brother-in-law just called me and said an
auspicious time is at 10 am on the 15th.

1670
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:15,960
For them both to unite in wedlock
and for both of us to get separated.

1671
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:23,020
Why do they call a time a father
parts with his daughter auspicious?

1672
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:29,710
Why don't you say why she called you?

1673
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:31,170
Anu said, she's in love with me.

1674
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:38,180
Hmm...

1675
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:40,170
She asked me to take her
somewhere and marry her.

1676
02:02:40,370 --> 02:02:41,340
Are you kidding me?

1677
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:49,420
Didn't she reject you till the very recent?

1678
02:02:54,610 --> 02:02:55,610
I'll talk to Anu.

1679
02:02:57,090 --> 02:02:57,840
Friend...

1680
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:02,840
Will you stop her dad from
stopping me when I take Anu?

1681
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:15,550
You gave me a word to be friends with
me till Karthik comes to Hyderabad.

1682
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:17,590
There's still 12 hours
left for him to arrive.

1683
02:03:19,710 --> 02:03:24,920
There's just 12 hours for you to stand on
your word and for me to secure my love.

1684
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:29,250
Would you be friends with
me just for this one night?

1685
02:03:57,300 --> 02:03:58,500
What are you planning to do?

1686
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:02,380
I booked two tickets for the 4 am train.

1687
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,010
Request the TC for an AC coach.

1688
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:21,100
She suffered with mosquito bites when
she travelled in second class last time.

1689
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:23,110
I booked in AC already.

1690
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:34,170
Maybe to some hotel or a friend's house...

1691
02:04:34,500 --> 02:04:35,760
I'm taking her to my house.

1692
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:45,520
There's still time. Why don't you sleep?

1693
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:48,530
I have to pack the luggage.

1694
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:20,270
I'll be outside.

1695
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:21,890
I'm feel a bit uncomfortable here.

1696
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,390
You're up already?

1697
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:02,340
Why didn't Sanju wake up yet?
There are so many works pending!

1698
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:06,180
Sanju!

1699
02:06:07,940 --> 02:06:09,840
Sanju... did you send him out somewhere?

1700
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:12,180
Didn't he wake up yet?

1701
02:06:12,930 --> 02:06:13,820
Sanju...

1702
02:06:17,010 --> 02:06:18,170
Why's Sanju's luggage not here?

1703
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:20,760
Hubby, why isn't Sanju's luggage here?

1704
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Where did he go?

1705
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,460
He'd be somewhere right here aunty.
You first go and wake up Anu.

1706
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:27,670
We're waiting to see
the bride since morning!

1707
02:06:28,250 --> 02:06:29,000
Yeah.

1708
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:32,670
Anu...

1709
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:36,430
She'd been talking to me for a long time
in the night. Let her sleep for a while.

1710
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:40,080
Did the dad and daughter need
so much chitchat night long?

1711
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,630
What's the need of ruining
sleep for chitchat?

1712
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:02,960
Hello, why's Anu right here Sanju?

1713
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:04,710
Didn't you take her?

1714
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,590
When I'm your friend,
aren't you a friend to me too?

1715
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:10,530
How could you think I'd keep quiet...

1716
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:12,930
when someone is eloping with
my friend's daughter my friend?

1717
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,440
Won't I risk even my life to stop it?

1718
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:19,420
Please don't mind that after staying
all these days at your home...

1719
02:07:19,820 --> 02:07:21,490
...I'm leaving your house
at the wedding time.

1720
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:26,090
I've kept the gift I wanted to give
your daughter, on the dressing table.

1721
02:07:27,910 --> 02:07:28,730
Bye uncle.

1722
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:00,460
AFTER SOME DAYS...

1723
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:09,550
Sanju! Get up son...

1724
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:12,180
Vishwanath came down from
Hyderabad with his family.

1725
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:35,390
How's Anu?

1726
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:39,290
She's fine

1727
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:41,840
Is Karthik taking good care of her?

1728
02:08:44,240 --> 02:08:45,330
How are you?

1729
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:52,490
Anu got married.
Have you stopped loving her?

1730
02:08:53,070 --> 02:08:54,900
A guy who failed in love
won't stop loving sir...

1731
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:56,470
...he'd just stop showing it out.

1732
02:08:57,930 --> 02:09:00,520
I thought you might be tensed,
but you look alright.

1733
02:09:02,860 --> 02:09:05,250
Nothing sir, I forgot everything
and am happily working here.

1734
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:08,220
You know the advantage in my story sir?

1735
02:09:08,630 --> 02:09:11,710
I loved a girl from other place
and not from my home town.

1736
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:13,800
As she's from another city,

1737
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:17,300
I'll just have the same visuals of
seeing her the last time for lifelong.

1738
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:19,730
You just said to have forgotten her.

1739
02:09:21,180 --> 02:09:22,460
then why are tears rolling out of your eyes?

1740
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:28,340
God is a bigger sadist than us.

1741
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:31,690
He gave a mouth to lie
and eyes to say the truth.

1742
02:09:32,650 --> 02:09:34,010
Forgetting isn't as easy as we think sir.

1743
02:09:34,620 --> 02:09:37,800
We don't remember Newton's law from school,
nor we remember Ohm's law from college.

1744
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:40,170
we won't remember Bernoulli's
theorem from Engineering either.

1745
02:09:40,910 --> 02:09:44,430
But about where, when and in which dress
did we see our love for the first time...

1746
02:09:45,090 --> 02:09:46,210
...can't be forgotten til death.

1747
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:48,840
We tend to forget what we study to remember.

1748
02:09:49,740 --> 02:09:52,030
But when we try to forget a girl... damn!

1749
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:55,430
We can't forget her till death.

1750
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:58,710
Are you really missing her so much?

1751
02:09:59,180 --> 02:10:01,910
Shall I tell you something, which only a
guy who fails in love understands, sir?

1752
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:04,900
When I remember her in the night
before sleeping and feel like crying...

1753
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:10,180
You know what hell it is crying without
parents in the next room noticing it?

1754
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:17,460
That girl is making me cry every night for
teasin her just one night in the train.

1755
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:19,420
When you loved her so much,

1756
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:24,790
why did you leave her go when she
asked to take her and marry her?

1757
02:10:25,170 --> 02:10:25,830
It's because of you sir.

1758
02:10:26,990 --> 02:10:31,050
As a token of our friendship,
either you or I should sacrifice Anu.

1759
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:34,550
If I sacrifice,
I have friends to avoid remembering Anu.

1760
02:10:35,380 --> 02:10:36,630
and my parents to console
me when I remember her.

1761
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:39,500
And people show a bit of sympathy
considering me a love failure.

1762
02:10:40,030 --> 02:10:41,340
But if you have to sacrifice,

1763
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:44,300
every guy who wishes you with a smile
on the street will laugh at you.

1764
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:48,550
You who worked in the office with respect
for 40 years will have to work in shame.

1765
02:10:49,320 --> 02:10:50,020
That's not it sir.

1766
02:10:50,310 --> 02:10:53,200
Even your relatives who look at you as
an elder won't even consider you a human.

1767
02:10:54,650 --> 02:10:55,870
You ask me why didn't I elope with her.

1768
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:57,970
How much time does it take
to elope with her sir?

1769
02:10:58,310 --> 02:10:59,970
It's just two seconds.

1770
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:03,000
I too understood when the
time to take her came...

1771
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:08,170
that I wasn't taking Anu with me
but was taking her away from you.

1772
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:13,250
First time, I didn't like myself.

1773
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:21,840
What are you both doing here
leaving the Kalyanam there?

1774
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:28,300
Will you marry Sanju to my daughter?

1775
02:11:30,670 --> 02:11:32,920
You mean that Doctor? No, I won't marry her.

1776
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,950
You won't give me whom I ask for but
want to give whoever you wish to.

1777
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:36,870
Listen to me boy.

1778
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:38,430
I don't like that sadist face.

1779
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:40,430
She and her attitude of
dominating her well wishers

1780
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:41,670
Mom, tell him I'm not interested.

1781
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:46,050
Will you take Anu as your daughter in law?

1782
02:11:48,650 --> 02:11:51,140
Anu? Didn't Anu get married?

1783
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:53,900
Ganesh even sent me her
photos in bridal attire?

1784
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,830
We just decorated her in bridal attire,
that's all.

1785
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:01,200
But what about the word you gave to Karthik?

1786
02:12:02,030 --> 02:12:04,070
When you sacrificed your love for us...

1787
02:12:05,870 --> 02:12:07,300
...can't I sacrifice my word for you?

1788
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,740
It isn't difficult to sacrifice,

1789
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:14,880
but to get someone qualified
enough to sacrifice for.

1790
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:19,510
We can sacrifice when we get a guy like you.

1791
02:12:21,670 --> 02:12:23,750
I should see Anu urgently.
Mom, I'm going to Hyderabad.

1792
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,250
- Okay son.
- Hello Friend, Anu isn't in Hyderabad

1793
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:31,550
She's waiting for you at the
place where your love started.

1794
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:55,960
Careful... the Kakinada to
Hyderabad route has become very bad.

1795
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:59,500
It seems they are teasing girls
wearing red striped shirts.

1796
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:04,060
To hell with them.

1797
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:08,330
Guys from Kakinada can never top a
Hyderabadi in terms of intelligence.

1798
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:11,800
I'll bash him up, ask him to come.
