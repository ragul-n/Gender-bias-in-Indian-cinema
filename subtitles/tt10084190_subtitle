1
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,840
Good morning.
Aadaab, sat shri akal Amritsar..

2
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,900
..you are listening 98.3 mirchi
with RJ.parvez..

3
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,030
Tell me one thing..
How do you start your day?

4
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,080
With Amritsari bread isn't it?
Amazing!

5
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,380
All you Amritsari people are
really genuine..

6
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,740
They say that when you are in love,
you'd do anything..

7
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,880
Well, you are in love with the food.

8
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,220
Ok.. I am leaving you with some
beautiful songs.

9
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,690
"An angel from Chandigarh is here.."

10
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,940
"An angel from Chandigarh is here..
she looks like a butterfly."

11
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,780
"She is here to cause trouble..
Beautiful Jatti.."

12
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,860
"Beautiful Jatti is here..
And she has already.."

13
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,180
"And she has already mesmerised
everyone.. Beautiful Jatti.."

14
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,140
"Beautiful Jatti is here.."

15
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,560
Turn around, girl.
The boy's honking for you.

16
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,460
This way, madam.
Get on it.

17
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,560
This way, this way, madam.
Tell me, where do you want to go?

18
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,920
- Move back!
- Come on, man.

19
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,820
She won't go with you.
So you better leave.

20
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,700
- Why? Why don't she go with us?
- Move back!

21
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,500
- Look at this, brother.
- Sit here madam.

22
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,340
They didn't even have a bath.
Whereas I have even used a deodorant.

23
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,990
I'll take your bags. You have a seat.

24
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,430
Rubbish.

25
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,360
- She is my passenger.
- He always does this.

26
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,170
- Whose bags are these?
- They aren't yours?

27
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,920
I didn't get any bags with me.

28
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,780
- Brother!
- Give my bags.

29
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,670
- Sorry, sir.
- Are you trying to steal them?

30
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,160
No way, sir.
I thought they belong to her.

31
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,420
Where do you want to go?

32
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,720
Guru Bazar.

33
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,750
Guru Bazar?

34
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,420
Come with me then.
Please sit down.

35
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,980
Madam, please move aside a little.

36
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,520
He will give you company
and me a chance to make 20 bucks.

37
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,180
Excuse me!
I wish to go alone.

38
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,600
Do you want to take me there
or shall I take another rickshaw?

39
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,500
Sir, you should
find another rickshaw.

40
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,720
Take any you want. I don't want any
problems this morning. Ok?

41
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,160
Where do you want to go, madam?

42
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,700
- Get out of here, I'll guide you.
- Okay.

43
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,720
"Beautiful Jatti is here.."

44
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,280
"Her eyes are like diamonds
and she shines like gold."

45
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,760
"She has put perfume on her body"

46
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,500
"She gets million-million likes, oh girl"

47
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,200
"Her fan following is genuine, not fake"

48
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,200
"She has finished her internet pack"

49
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,580
"Beautiful Jatti.."

50
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,300
"She passed through the market.
Don't ask what happened next."

51
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,080
"Danger started looming around."

52
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,700
"The boys who followed here.."

53
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,320
Yes, mom?
- Reet, are you out somewhere?

54
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,630
No, I am in office.
Chandigarh..

55
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,630
- Why can I hear noises?
- Mom, client's here.

56
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:44,380
"The boys turned
around out of fear."

57
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,800
He doesn't know. Let's go.

58
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,690
Madam, ask the boys
who are playing over there.

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,570
This match is going to
have a nail biting finish.

60
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,650
It's the tenth over.

61
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,340
You stay away, mister.

62
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,840
You stink,
you haven't had a bath.

63
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,130
We need 6 runs in
2 balls to win the match..

64
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,120
With the ball we have a poor substitute
for Malinga.

65
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,580
Bowler bowls..

66
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,770
Batsman hits it with his bat and the
ball is going high up in the air..

67
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,480
The way the batsman is running, it looks
like he shall soon cross the border.

68
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,520
Monty and Shonty are
ready to catch the ball.

69
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,230
Both of them end up banging into
each other just like the state buses.

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,900
We need six runs in
two balls to win the match!

71
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,800
Excuse me?

72
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,260
Out!

73
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,500
What have you done?

74
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,260
He got distracted.

75
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,100
It's okay. He plays well.

76
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,230
- Come on, it's my turn now.
- Congratulations.

77
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,700
He got out!

78
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,320
He just played.

79
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,250
Can you tell me where this place is?

80
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,230
36-24-36?

81
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,980
Someone's residence coincides
with Katrina Kaif's figure.

82
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,380
Sorry, those are dress measurements.

83
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Just a minute.

84
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,760
Here.
This is the address.

85
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,380
You are from Chandigarh?

86
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,740
Yes, how do you know?

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,500
You have an address written
on a nightclub's card.

88
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,480
Such advanced girls who visit
nightclubs can only be from Chandigarh.

89
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,200
Why? Don't girls over
here go to nightclubs?

90
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,240
Boys don't either here.

91
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,900
- Why?
- Culture.

92
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,160
We party during daytime.

93
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,400
Nonsense.
That's why I don't like Amritsar.

94
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,960
- Anyway..
- Why? What's wrong with Amritsar?

95
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,820
It is such a beautiful city. People
from across the world come here.

96
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,760
True.

97
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,760
Please, can you guide
me to this place?

98
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,740
The Chabutara lane?

99
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,080
Not Chabutara.. Chowk Chabutara.

100
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,520
Right, exactly.
Can you tell me where it is?

101
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,540
You will get lost in the lanes.
Let me take you there.

102
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,360
No, thank you.
Please just guide me.

103
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,520
- There are many dogs in those lanes.
- Do they bite?

104
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,440
Have you heard of dogs that kiss?

105
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,020
It's their job to bite.
Of course they will bite.

106
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,380
Let me take you there.

107
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,040
I'll manage.
You just tell me where it is.

108
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
I'll go on my own.

109
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,760
Go straight, you'll see
Bhola 'Rabardiwala' (sweet shop).

110
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,800
Take a left from there, there you'll
see Nata 'Golgappewala' (snack shop).

111
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,200
Once you take a right
from Nata 'Golgappewala'..

112
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,440
..you'll come across
Natha 'Golpapadiwala' (snack shop).

113
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,820
After you take a left
from Natha 'Golpapadiwala'..

114
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,440
..you'll come across
Kailash 'Jalebianwala' (sweet shop).

115
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,580
Around 25 meters away from kailash
'Jalebianwala', is a 'Khurana Faluda' shop.

116
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,840
There's where Chowk
Chabutara begins from.

117
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,560
What kind of directions are these?

118
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
Directions of a city
which loves to eat.

119
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
By the way,
what did you say your name was?

120
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,760
I didn't tell you my name.

121
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,020
Thank you.

122
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,800
Let's get back to it.
I am not out.

123
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,760
It was a refreshment break.
Start bowling.

124
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,480
He always making excuses.
Let's go.

125
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,600
2 bowls are left. We will win.

126
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,080
'Keep listening to..

127
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,420
'..India's number one Radio Station 98.3 Mirchi'

128
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,580
'Mirchi listeners are always happy.'

129
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,080
"Turn around, girl.
The boy's honking for you."

130
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,900
How dare you misbehave!

131
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,540
I am not misbehaving.
I am not teasing her.

132
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,400
This song is meant to
ask people to move aside.

133
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Shut up.

134
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,660
- Hello?
- Where are you?

135
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,400
Yes mom, I'm in the office.

136
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,280
- ...tell me honestly where are you?
- No, I'm with a client..

137
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
In Chandigarh office, mom.

138
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,020
I'm with a client.

139
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,220
- Madam, please do visit Wagha Border.
- Listen to me... which client is this ?

140
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,000
- I'll call you back.
- It's a very beautiful place.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,480
Are you crazy?
Can't you see that I'm on a call?

142
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,240
I think everyone
in Amritsar is crazy.

143
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,060
Bloody idiot.

144
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,160
Madam!

145
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,760
I won't hear a word
against Amritsar.

146
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,580
We are simple and honest people.

147
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,000
We are not like you.

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,720
She's in Amritsar and saying
that she's in Chandigarh.

149
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,560
What?

150
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,160
- You want me to teach you a lesson?
- Go ahead?

151
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,600
I'll teach you a lesson
if I get down to it.

152
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,160
Your place, your time,
my stick against your delusion..

153
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,620
You must have heard the rest.

154
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,580
Wait here.

155
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,460
- Brother!
- Go ahead.

156
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,320
Brother!

157
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,980
Brother!

158
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,440
Brother!

159
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,780
He is misbehaving with me.

160
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,980
Run, run, run..

161
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,880
Pull them out!

162
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,340
What?

163
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,660
- He is.. Hey!
- Run, run, run..

164
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,200
Ill-mannered!

165
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,420
Uncle, where's 302?

166
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,060
302?!

167
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,720
Next to 301.

168
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,320
Thank you.

169
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,640
Where's 302?

170
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,700
I don't know.

171
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,600
Who is she?

172
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,980
- She looks familiar.
- No sister..

173
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,180
Till your son doesn't get married,
you will feel the same.

174
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,960
Hello.

175
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,820
Where does Rajveer stay?

176
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,080
Which Rajveer?

177
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,700
The one who eloped with a girl?

178
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,320
No sister,
she is talking about the Rajveer..

179
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,020
..your daughter
wanted to elope with.

180
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,920
- Sister?
- Yes?

181
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,380
Don't make me thrash you.

182
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,760
Auntie, auntie..
302.

183
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,340
- It's over there.
- Okay, thank you.

184
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,060
Hey kiddo..

185
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,600
Where does Rajveer stay?

186
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,820
I can be Rajveer too.

187
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,960
Idiot.

188
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,580
You have a lot of
scurfs on your head.

189
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,140
You mean dandruff?

190
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,660
Don't pretend to be modern.

191
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,500
On your head its seems like..

192
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,060
- ..a lots of black nits running around..
- Hello.

193
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,180
Where does Rajveer stay?

194
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,640
Over there, the door that's locked.

195
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,120
Okay.
When will he come back?

196
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,720
Do you too have to
take money from him?

197
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,480
No, I am here for some work.

198
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,220
But he doesn't work.

199
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,000
What work could you have with him?

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
Are you his friend?

201
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,020
No.

202
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,240
His girlfriend?

203
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,340
No.

204
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,640
Are you thinking
about marrying him ?

205
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,140
- No.
- Don't even think about it.

206
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,240
The girl who get married into
this locality have a tough life.

207
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,340
We too used to be like you.

208
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,960
Slim & fit!

209
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,220
We were once title holders, Miss Ludhiana,
Miss Patiala and Miss Gidharbaha.

210
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,240
Look at us,
we are all missing out now.

211
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,220
Thank you.

212
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,700
Why did you make her run away.

213
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,220
Good that you made her run away.

214
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,100
If such a beautiful girl
would have married and come here..

215
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,440
..then all of us would
have looked bad in front of her.

216
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,420
Sir, can I have your phone please?

217
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,320
I need to tell my family
that I won't eating at home today.

218
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
If it is ready then
ask them to send it over me.

219
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,920
Don't waste my talk-time
and get back to work.

220
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,660
- Do you have a PCO around?
- What?

221
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,840
- A PCO?
- No, there isn't any.

222
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,760
Can I use your phone?

223
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,020
I left my phone in a rickshaw.

224
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,440
- Yes sure. Take it.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,540
Thank you.

226
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,320
What have you done?

227
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,280
- It slipped. Not my fault.
- Your hands aren't working?

228
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,140
I didn't realise.
I didn't do it on purpose.

229
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,220
Pick-up!

230
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,560
"I fly above the rest.."

231
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,280
Stop the rickshaw!

232
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,360
Stop!
Stop the rickshaw, man!

233
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,720
Okay, okay.

234
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,320
Stop the rickshaw.

235
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,060
What's wrong?

236
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,000
Your rickshaw is vibrating.

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,500
There's something in it.

238
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,420
Vibrating?
It's must be because of you.

239
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,580
It cannot be possessed.

240
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,480
What are you trying to say?

241
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,260
What do you mean?
That I am fat? Am I fat?

242
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,340
I mean you should be thankful that
the government stopped toll tax..

243
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
..or else you would have
to pay tax at every junction.

244
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,300
Damn you!

245
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,620
May you get ruined.

246
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,500
You are making fun of me!
May your rickshaw's tyre blows up.

247
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,140
May you be ruined.

248
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,600
May its chain fall off.

249
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,760
May.. you should drown.

250
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,860
Get lost!

251
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,080
Pick up.

252
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,460
Uncle, I'm taking a ball.

253
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,100
You took one before as well.

254
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,700
- I ate it.
- What?

255
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,340
You are doing well.
Why do you need to worry. Right?

256
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,260
You should first pay for the ball.

257
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,560
I am not running away.

258
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,220
We always come here.
I forgot my wallet.

259
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,660
- Hi Reet.
- Simmi, listen..

260
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,180
If mom calls tell her
that I am at Chandigarh office.

261
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,500
- What? - And also tell her
that you met me half an hour ago.

262
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,160
- Where are you?
- I am in Amritsar..

263
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,700
..to reject the boy my parents
have selected for me.

264
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,880
A boy? In Amritsar?

265
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,720
What's going on, Reet?
Tell me everything.

266
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
It's a long story.
Listen to me.

267
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,880
I forgot my phone in a rickshaw.

268
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,400
His phone number was in my phone.

269
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,540
Somehow,
take his number from my parents.

270
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,400
- I'll call you back in some time.
- Okay? Bye.

271
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
- Shall we take another one.
- Thank you.

272
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,240
We haven't even paid for this one.

273
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,400
What are you doing here?

274
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
I never said that we
would never meet again.

275
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,620
Did you find the address
you were looking for?

276
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,700
Yes, I did.

277
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,780
It's a very bad locality.

278
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,380
Really! Then you should have
gone to some other locality.

279
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,920
I am not here to
take a house on rent.

280
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,380
I had come to meet someone.

281
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,780
The people there made me go crazy.

282
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,940
Very weird people.

283
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,940
You know they don't even
know how to talk to someone.

284
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,120
Come on, if you wanted to
talk you could have done so with me.

285
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,000
You didn't have to go so far.

286
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,360
Yeah. Shut up.

287
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,740
You took offence to it.

288
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,960
You talk a lot.
What do you eat?

289
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,260
Amritsari Kulchas (flatbread).

290
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,640
- Would you like some?
- No, thanks.

291
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,640
Is there.. any coffee shop nearby?

292
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,820
Any?

293
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
No, many.
There are many coffee shops here.

294
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,220
I couldn't find even one.

295
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,520
Do you have coffee shops in
residential complexes in Chandigarh?

296
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,580
You have to go out
to the market to find one.

297
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,840
Tell me where it is.

298
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,400
Take a left from the Tikkan
Sweet Shop over there.

299
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,340
No, come back.

300
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,920
- You'll get confused.
- Chotu..

301
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,900
Who are you addressing as Chotu?

302
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,580
Be a brother and walk
her to the coffee shop.

303
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,520
Is she related to me?

304
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,160
They see a girl and start
treating a friend like a servant.

305
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,500
Here's your phone.

306
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,780
You can walk her there,
I am leaving.

307
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,460
There you go.
He's asked me to do it.

308
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,460
- Let's go. I need to come back.
- No, thanks. I'll go on my own.

309
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,560
- Rickshaw!
- No, no, no.

310
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,120
- Excuse me, please stop..
- Madam, lunch break.

311
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,180
- There..
- No.

312
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Strange people!

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,700
Let me drop you.

314
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,520
No, thanks. I'll manage.

315
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,260
I never said that you cannot.

316
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,660
It's because of the
culture of Amritsar.

317
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,040
We help everyone.

318
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,220
Are you flirting with me?

319
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,860
Hello!
I am not like the way you think I am.

320
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,460
I am not even thinking about you.

321
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,160
Then I am the mad one
who worry about a girl..

322
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,280
..roaming around
in this scorching heat.

323
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,580
Are there any cabs here?

324
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,780
Even auto-rickshaws run
only one alternate days here.

325
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,800
At this hour,
you won't get any thing anyway.

326
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,300
I am from a decent family.

327
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,340
You shall leave as you came.

328
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,880
Hop on.

329
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,380
Come on.

330
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,480
'He's wearing a turban,
I can trust him.'

331
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,160
Shall we leave?

332
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,120
Don't pillion riders
here wear a helmet?

333
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,160
Here even the riders don't wear one.

334
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,520
Thank you.

335
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,140
Six years ago, someone
helped my father cross the road.

336
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,160
We send sweets over to
their house on every Diwali.

337
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,140
Are people of Chandigarh so rude?

338
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,280
They just say thank you?

339
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,720
You want me to buy
you a box of sweets?

340
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,940
No, but you could at
least offer me some water.

341
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,120
Are you sure?

342
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,860
- Huh?
- No, no, no, no.

343
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,420
Are you sure you are
not flirting with me?

344
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,980
Oh come on!

345
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,720
This is the difference between people
of Chandigarh and Amritsar.

346
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,260
What you call flirting
is something we call manners.

347
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,080
If a girl had said the same thing
would you say that she's flirting?

348
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,060
Would you like some
water here or inside?

349
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,980
Inside.

350
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,000
Even doctors advice against
drinking water while standing up.

351
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,920
Let's go.

352
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,100
Take the keys out of the motorbike,
I forgot to.

353
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,300
Take them off,
we need to go back as well.

354
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,020
Otherwise,
we will have to push it around.

355
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,060
Have you ever seen such
a coffee shop? Yeah?

356
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,360
Yes, ma'am?

357
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,760
Hi!
A coffee for me, a latte.

358
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,180
And water for him.

359
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,300
- Okay, ma'am.
- Hello!

360
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,180
- Yes, sir?
- I don't want water.

361
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,540
I too want coffee.

362
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,480
And, sir want something to eat as well.

363
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,700
A grilled sandwich,
well grilled on both sides.

364
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,780
With three packets of sauce.

365
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,400
- Now you can say okay sir.
- Okay, sir.

366
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,860
You respect yourself a lot.

367
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,260
No, I respect others as well.

368
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,580
But I respect myself a little more.

369
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,860
Hello, Bhola.

370
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,040
Brother, we increased the
like count on Karamjit Anmol's page.

371
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,900
I have already called him up thrice,
he still hasn't paid up.

372
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,920
Hack his page like we
had hacked Jaspinder Bhalla's.

373
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,980
He will pay double the amount now.

374
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,000
You look upset.

375
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,720
I lost my phone.

376
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,320
I left it in the rickshaw
I was travelling in.

377
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,840
Do you know the rickshaw driver?

378
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,740
Do I look like someone who'd
be friends with a rickshaw drive?

379
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,180
It's not so.

380
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,660
I asked because you are a local.

381
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,980
Well, I can find out.

382
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,500
But what brought you here.

383
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,880
Do I need to tell you?

384
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,940
Fine then,
you can find your phone on your own.

385
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
I had come to meet
a prospective groom.

386
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,480
- Oh.
- Why, oh?

387
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,700
Can only a boy go to
meet a prospective bride?

388
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,660
A girl cannot go to
meet a prospective groom?

389
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
So you met him?

390
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,060
I already told you,
his house was locked.

391
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,200
Then call him up and
ask him to come here.

392
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,360
His number was on the
phone which I have lost.

393
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,320
Now I don't know for
how long will I have to wait.

394
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,240
To say no to him?

395
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,400
How do you know?

396
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
I overheard you when
you were talking on the phone.

397
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,920
You are so unmannered.

398
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,640
You stand and eavesdrop
on other people's conversations!

399
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,200
I would have taken a seat
but there was not chair there.

400
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
And as loudly as you spoke,
everyone must have heard it.

401
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,780
Give it here.

402
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,040
#Cappuccino, #DrinkItFast

403
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,220
By the way,
why do you want to reject him?

404
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,960
Are you seeing someone else?

405
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,000
Shut up.

406
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,260
Still..

407
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,720
My parents fixed our
marriage without my consent.

408
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,120
He too is an idiot.

409
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,740
He just saw my photograph
and agreed to marry me.

410
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,480
Bloody idiot.

411
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,980
Right! You tell me!

412
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,440
I don't know how he looks like,
what he does.

413
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,760
Whether our nature will match or not!

414
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,340
Whether our thinking
will match or not!

415
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,540
Nothing! He just said yes.

416
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,680
You are absolutely right.

417
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,460
You need to have a good understanding
in order to get married.

418
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,180
- Thoughts should match.
- Right.

419
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,660
Did you notice something?

420
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,700
We just met a while ago
and our thoughts seem to match.

421
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,080
Don't try to get too friendly.

422
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,700
Finish your coffee and go home.

423
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,660
This is the problem with boys.

424
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,380
Just talk to them and
they will start flirting.

425
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,400
Hello!

426
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Chandigarh boys must be doing that.

427
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,720
Not the boys from Amritsar.

428
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,560
If you had to reject him,
you could have just called him.

429
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,680
Why did you have to come here?

430
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,020
I will have to sit
and explain it to him.

431
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,400
So that he says no for this match.

432
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,280
I am not dying to
meet that Amritsari boy.

433
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,660
What do you mean by Amritsari?

434
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,460
Because he is from Amritsar.
Amritsari.

435
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,340
But you don't need to say
it in such a degraded manner.

436
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,180
Boys of Amritsar are 100 times
better than boys of Chandigarh.

437
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,360
No way!

438
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,740
You cannot even talk
properly in a single language.

439
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,060
Bathing, sleeping,
doing, "ing" for everything!

440
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,240
People can at least
understand what we say.

441
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,620
It's not like how you all speak. A
mixture of English, Hindi and Punjabi.

442
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,200
If you ask someone where PGI is,
they say.

443
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,600
Take left from
the round about and you'll reach PGI.

444
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,340
You don't realise whether
it is Punjab's capital or Bihar's.

445
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,580
Our language is so sweet
that even when we abuse someone..

446
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,600
..they say,
can you abuse us again, please?

447
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,880
Right?

448
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,860
- Okay, I'll get going then.
- Where to?

449
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,860
You told me to drink
the coffee and go home.

450
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,500
Okay, I'm paying for
my coffee you pay for yours.

451
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,900
I'm not carrying any money.

452
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,040
What are you all staring at?

453
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,580
Continue to do what you are doing.

454
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,220
What do you mean by you
are not carrying any money?

455
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,780
Fine then put these on your instagram.

456
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,400
#GettingBeatenUp
# WashingUtensils

457
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,060
Listen, I really don't
have any money on me.

458
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,280
I was only out to play cricket.
I didn't need any money.

459
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,660
We don't place bets while playing.

460
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,620
Please pay for me, I'll pay you later.

461
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,840
Why should I pay your bill?

462
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,480
I am riding a bike
that worth 1,500,000.

463
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,840
Do you think that
I won't pay you back 200?

464
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,400
Deduct it from this.

465
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,860
Sorry ma'am, you'll have
to give us the exact change.

466
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,840
We don't have any change.

467
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,100
I don't have change either.

468
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,440
- Now what?
- What do you mean by now what?

469
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,380
Now tell us where do
we go to wash the utensils.

470
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,540
Over there, sir.

471
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,480
Don't you have any shame?

472
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,920
You are directing us to the
place where you wash utensils..

473
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,180
..when you have Paytm!

474
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,520
What's the bill amount?

475
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,540
You made me beg her for no reason.

476
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,700
Here you go.

477
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,600
I paid for you as well.

478
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,520
- Thank you.
- There you go.

479
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,560
Tables have turned now.

480
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,040
Earlier someone had to pay someone.

481
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,140
Now someone has to pay someone.

482
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,480
Let's go to the ATM.

483
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,540
Let's go.

484
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,400
Stop the rickshaw!
Stop it!

485
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,040
- I told you to stop it!
- What?

486
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,700
I said stop, can't you hear me?

487
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,180
What's wrong, sister?

488
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,880
Your rickshaw's seat is vibrating.

489
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,920
No, it's not so.

490
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,700
Some people are having that
misunderstanding since morning.

491
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,660
What misunderstanding?
Do you think I am lying?

492
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,040
No, I didn't mean that.

493
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,340
Then what did you mean?

494
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,360
We caused bloodshed because
of the truth and you call us a liar!

495
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,500
No, sister!
Please listen to me.

496
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,740
What should I listen to?
You are calling us a liar.

497
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,080
Get this straight.

498
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,420
I neither lie nor do I tolerate liars.

499
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,480
If you keep blabbering
then I'll teach you a lesson.

500
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,820
Please forgive me.

501
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,920
I cannot say about the seat
but I surely am vibrating out of fear.

502
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,720
- Now he gets back on the track.
- Yes.

503
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,580
Stupid! Get lost! Let's go.

504
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,880
I don't know why the seat is vibrating.

505
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Why are you getting acting weird?
Do you want to get me killed?

506
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,400
Nothing's happening.
How is it vibrating?

507
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,920
You vibrate only when
passengers sit on you?

508
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,440
Why don't you vibrate now?

509
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,600
Damn you! Next time I will
tear you apart and throw you away.

510
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,800
Do you understand, Murari Express?

511
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,900
I'd say don't bother. It's my treat.

512
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,260
No, thanks.
Here's your 144 rupees.

513
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,800
We're quits now.

514
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,340
You are giving me exact change.

515
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,860
The way you keep tab on the money,
I think you are an accountant.

516
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,020
I'm a fashion designer.

517
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,800
Oh.

518
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,980
That's why the 36-24-36.

519
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,820
That's my client's dress size.

520
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,840
Whatever it was, it was great.

521
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,520
Tell me something,
how did you like Amritsar's fashion?

522
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,280
Outdated.

523
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Now do you want us to wear
Safari Suits while going out to play?

524
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,340
Hello!

525
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,060
Listen, at least tell me
what are we lacking in our fashion?

526
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,120
It doesn't have the
Chandigarh vibe to it.

527
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,960
When I buy clothes from Amritsar
how can it give Chandigarh's vibes?

528
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,780
It lacks in swag.

529
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,140
Your style makes one feel that you
wear clothes only to cover your body.

530
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,620
That's the point of clothing.

531
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,860
Not like you girls wear hot
pants and make the world follow you.

532
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,380
Even the elderly who can't see,
try to focus on your legs.

533
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,120
Why? Don't the girls
in Amritsar wear shorts?

534
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,080
They have been ruined
by the fashion of Chandigarh.

535
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,220
At least you agree that the
world is crazy about our fashion.

536
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,740
It's not your own.
You follow trends in abroad.

537
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,380
You copied from them and
that too a trend of torn clothes.

538
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,040
Torn pants, a sari made out of net.

539
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,300
In them you look like you
just had a fight with a mad dog.

540
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,080
Our fashion is original.

541
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,020
When a Amritsari girl moves
out with Pulkari (embroidered) dress..

542
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,820
A flower in her hair,
plaits with colourful extensions..

543
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,220
Anklets on her feet and sandals
that quack when they walk..

544
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,400
People say stop..

545
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,800
A Punjabi girl is passing by.

546
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,000
Do you know why I
am saying this to you?

547
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,940
So that you know that
our fashion is original.

548
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,980
It's not outdated, it's modern.

549
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,200
Arrogant much!

550
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,120
So, I finally managed to silence you?

551
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,300
- Modern?
- Yes.

552
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,100
Have you ever kissed a girl?

553
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,600
What are you talking about?

554
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,080
About kissing.

555
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,120
You are modern, right?

556
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,180
Have you done it?

557
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
I haven't.

558
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
But I will if someone asks me to.

559
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,560
They are right in saying..

560
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,580
..that there are two types of boys.

561
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,540
First are Idiots.

562
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,800
And second?

563
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,060
Bigger idiots.

564
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,980
And I can't decide which
category do you fit in.

565
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,760
Have you ever done it?

566
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,140
I had tried once.

567
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,840
When I got closer to the girl,
she started crying.

568
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,740
She started crying?

569
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,800
It was my first time.

570
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,340
I didn't know how
close do I need to get.

571
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,400
I ended up stamping her foot.

572
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,700
I am a decent boy so I got confused.

573
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,620
- So I left it there itself.
- Then?

574
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,720
Then?

575
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,300
I massaged her foot with
hot water and dropped her home.

576
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
You dropped her home?

577
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,300
It's our culture.
I was bound to drop her home.

578
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,100
What kind of a culture is this?

579
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,360
You first make the girl
cry and then you drop her home.

580
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,900
Can you ever do anything right?

581
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,420
Have you ever done this
illegal act of kissing?

582
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,160
Why should I tell you?

583
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,120
It's not like I'll tell everyone.

584
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,400
Who knows? What if you do?

585
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,140
You will only benefit from it.

586
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,520
You have come to reject the boy.
He will reject you instead.

587
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,580
It is not so.

588
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,400
I am well-cultured Indian girl.

589
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
I am not a Alien either.

590
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,100
You managed to get all
the information from me..

591
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,920
..but didn't tell me anything.

592
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,480
You wouldn't have believed
me even if I'd told you.

593
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,260
You boys always have a bad
opinion about girls from Chandigarh.

594
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,880
Have you done it?

595
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,400
Yes, I have.

596
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,340
But it's not a big deal.
I mean, with friends.

597
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,000
Like on the forehead, or on the hand..

598
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,400
Even if that friend is a boy?

599
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,780
A friend is a friend.

600
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,940
The only requirement is a clean heart.

601
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,620
Can we be friends?

602
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,420
I am talking about my college friends.

603
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,400
I'd asked mom to let me
stay in a hostel in Chandigarh.

604
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,300
- But she didn't agree.
- Oh really?

605
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,020
Where is your culture now?

606
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,040
I wanted to go there to teach
Chandigarh Amritsar's culture.

607
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,020
Forget it.

608
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,980
Help me find my phone if you can.

609
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,860
Sure. Let's go.

610
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,400
Here you go, sir.

611
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Give a cup of tea to me as well.

612
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,840
- I'll get it.
- I'll pay you tomorrow.

613
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,000
What is wrong, Murari?

614
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,940
What do I tell you? I am
having such a bad day since morning.

615
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,400
Whenever a passenger
sits on the rickshaw..

616
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,800
..after a while they ask me to stop.
They say that the seat is vibrating.

617
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,920
When I ask where is it vibrating,
they slap me.

618
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,040
I haven't made a single
rupee since morning.

619
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,300
And I have already
been slapped five times.

620
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,240
I had told you to
buy a top model rickshaw.

621
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,860
But you didn't listen to me.

622
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,240
See, now your rickshaw
turned out to be faulty.

623
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,940
It is not faulty.

624
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,860
I got it checked by a mechanic.

625
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,900
- You got it checked?
- Yes.

626
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,320
Then why does it vibrate?

627
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,580
That's what I don't understand.

628
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,660
Show it to Talli then.

629
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,660
Has Talli started
repairing rickshaws now?

630
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,020
Then don't show it to
him and keep getting slapped.

631
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,080
I don't know from where do we
start looking for your mobile phone.

632
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,640
There are more than 10,000
Biharis working in the city.

633
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,680
So what do we do?

634
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,760
Let's lodge a complaint
at the police station.

635
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,480
Perhaps they might be able to find it.
Let's go.

636
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,980
No, I can lodge a complaint
at the police station on my own.

637
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,780
- You go and continue with your match.
- That I will.

638
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,720
Everyone in the locality
must be waiting for me to bat.

639
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,680
Listen..

640
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,460
Which way is the Chabutara from here?

641
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,840
Chowk Chabutara!

642
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,940
You cannot even get a name right.

643
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,120
People of Amritsar are crazy..

644
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,000
..to say yes to a girl from Chandigarh
just by looking at her photo!

645
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,300
You talk a lot. What do you eat?

646
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,780
I can't say about me,
but you do chew on people's brains.

647
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,400
Now if we call sector
seventeen as sector between.

648
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,680
Or call sector twenty-two
as sector very few?

649
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,240
Your city has strange locality names.
It's not so in our city.

650
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,660
Loon Mandi, Ghee Mandi, Gur Bazaar

651
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,920
- Papadanwala Bazaar!
- Well done!

652
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,680
You know all the markets
named after food.

653
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,040
You only can't get
Chowk Chabutara right.

654
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,540
Fine, tell me where
is Chowk Chabutara!

655
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,840
That's where I am going. Hop on!

656
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,220
Hop on!

657
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,540
Stop!

658
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,580
- Here?
- Stop. Stop.

659
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,800
Why? Don't you want to go inside?

660
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,640
It's not right. I'll go on my own.

661
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,200
Right. He might think that..

662
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,500
..you are rejecting him
because you're going on with me.

663
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,080
Don't you think too much of yourself?

664
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,200
- Just worried about you.
- How nice of you.

665
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,340
Thank you. Bye.

666
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,620
Bye!

667
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,060
I've been driving her around from
so long and all I get is a sad bye.

668
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,220
Yes, Bhola?

669
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,040
Hey girl, you are back!

670
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,540
Is Rajveer back?

671
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,400
No, he isn't.

672
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,880
If it's urgent,
leave a message with me.

673
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,420
I'll pass your message to him.

674
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,860
No, I wanted to talk to him.

675
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,840
Fine, then keep visiting
if you have nothing else to do.

676
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,680
"You keep wandering in Amritsar.."

677
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,300
Okay Bhola,
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

678
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,000
- Bye.
- You are still here?

679
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,240
Bhola had called so..
You said no to him so quickly?

680
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,980
His house is still locked.

681
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,900
What kind of a boy is he!

682
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,040
Such a beautiful girl is here
to reject him and he has gone missing.

683
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,440
I suggest you put a board
outside his house which says..

684
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,360
'I reject you.'

685
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,200
How would he know who rejected him?

686
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,060
Is he expecting someone
else's rejection as well?

687
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,540
- My phone!
- Oh no!

688
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,780
She has brought this
Sardarji along to beat me up!

689
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,840
- My phone! My phone! My phone!
- Run, Murari! Run!

690
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,660
Run, Murari!

691
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
Hey! Stop!

692
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,100
Stop! - Run!

693
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,920
I didn't do anything!

694
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,300
- I'll tear you apart.
- Leave me alone.

695
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,640
Don't come after me.

696
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,960
Give way! Move aside!

697
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
What are you staring at?
Get lost from here.

698
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Killed me!

699
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,040
- Back off.
- No, you back off!

700
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,480
Back off!

701
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
Hello!

702
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Stop!

703
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,020
Go, go, go hurry up!

704
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,500
Move aside!

705
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,860
Stop!

706
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,900
- I'm driving, what more do you expect!
- Catch him!

707
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,400
Get closer to him, I'll catch him!

708
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,060
You are not Milkha Singh that
you'll be able to catch up with him.

709
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,240
I said get closer to him. Don't stop!

710
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
Come on.

711
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,600
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

712
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,240
I think he has motorized his rickshaw.

713
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,220
Stop! Stop stop stop!

714
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,200
Have you lost your mind?

715
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,380
Did your motorbike break down?

716
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,400
I am out of gas.

717
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,620
- You don't put gas in it?
- I did.

718
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,580
And you ran out of it so soon?

719
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,020
It's not a Luna that once you
fill the tank it will last for a year.

720
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,420
- What happened? Out of gas?
- Stop!

721
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,900
Gas station is over there!

722
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,020
- Stop following me.
- Push it.

723
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,140
- He once again ran away because of you.
- Push it!

724
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,740
- Push harder!
- Come on!

725
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
Where's your Bhola who
had gone to get gas for you?

726
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,980
There he is.

727
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,360
- Bhola!
- Yes.

728
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,500
I asked you to get gas!
Why did you bring buttermilk with you?

729
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,120
- It is gas.
- In a jug?

730
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,020
At the pump station they
don't allow to take gas in a bottle.

731
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,020
It's Gas,
they not giving gas in bottle

732
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,380
A wedding procession!
Shall we go and dance?

733
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,140
I'm going. You may leave
after fill gas in motorbike.

734
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,440
Okay, bro.

735
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,380
"Listen to what I have to say."

736
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,180
"Today we will dance and have fun."

737
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,880
"Listen to what I have to say."

738
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,800
"Today we will dance and have fun."

739
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,240
"Everyone will watch us in awe.
We'll brew up a storm."

740
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,720
"Let others get jealous,
don't bother."

741
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,620
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

742
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,160
"Let the world go to hell,
don't bother."

743
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,620
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

744
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,340
"Let the world go to hell,
don't bother."

745
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,400
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

746
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,620
"Though I am an expert,
who goes through the drill every day."

747
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,520
"But you are highly intoxicating.."

748
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,980
"You give a high like no other."

749
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,400
"You are highly intoxicating.."

750
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
"You give a high like no other."

751
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
"You are highly intoxicating.."

752
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
"Don't worry about anything."

753
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
"I have the whole
of Amritsar under me."

754
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
"Don't worry about anything."

755
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
"I have the whole
of Amritsar under me."

756
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
"There is good music playing,
everyone's surrounding us.

757
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
"There is good music playing,
everyone's surrounding us.

758
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
"Let me be your beloved!"

759
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

760
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
"Let the world go to hell,
don't bother."

761
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

762
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
"Let the world go to hell,
don't bother."

763
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

764
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
"You are highly intoxicating.."

765
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
"Come on dear.."

766
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
"You are highly intoxicating.."

767
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
"Give me a chance, hold my hand.."

768
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
"You will forget Chandigarh,
I guarantee that."

769
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
"Give me a chance, hold my hand.."

770
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
"You will forget Chandigarh,
I guarantee that."

771
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
"Don't stop me anymore,
you too hit the dance floor.."

772
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
"Heed my advice, I have only
your best interest in my mind.."

773
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

774
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
"Let the world go to hell,
don't bother."

775
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,900
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

776
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,400
"Let the world go to hell,
don't bother."

777
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
"Come on dear, let's dance together."

778
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
"You are highly intoxicating.."

779
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
"Come on dear.."

780
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
"You are highly intoxicating.."

781
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,300
How much is this one for?

782
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,280
It's for 2500.

783
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
What? It's very expensive.

784
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,500
Quote the right price, I like it.

785
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,400
What according to
you is its right price?

786
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,280
500. Come on.

787
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,400
You should give me your phone number.

788
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I'll consult with my wife whether..

789
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,220
..I should pay for your
dress and call you back.

790
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,760
I have been looking
all around for you.

791
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,080
What are you doing here?

792
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,600
Why?
I came here to buy a dress.

793
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,900
You were busy dancing at
someone's wedding procession..

794
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,100
Someone's.. It is a wedding
procession in Amritsar.

795
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,620
I knew a few of the guests.

796
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,980
I can even dance where I only
know the horse the groom is riding.

797
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,360
So, did you buy the dress?

798
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,720
No, he was asking 2500 for it.

799
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,840
Such dresses are available for 500.

800
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,100
It is right for a girl from
Chandigarh to bargain like this?

801
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,820
It's okay, you can assume
that I am from Bhatinda.

802
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,340
I want to save my money.

803
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,380
How can I forget the coffee incident?

804
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,840
How much you love money.

805
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,720
This isn't about loving money.

806
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,040
It's my hard earned money.

807
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,400
Will you pay 600 for
something which is worth 500?

808
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,280
I have bought cylinders
at a premium price many times.

809
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,900
I am talking about a serious matter.
It's not about being money minded.

810
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,420
Everyone wants money.
Everybody saves money.

811
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,620
If you had come with your wife..

812
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,580
..would you have brought
that dress for 2500?

813
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,800
Yes, if my wife was hot
I'd even pay 3500 for that dress.

814
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,720
You never would.

815
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,580
You might have asked her to pay with
a promise that you'll pay her later.

816
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,900
Like you did with
me in the coffee shop.

817
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,880
I am not like that always.
I was out to play cricket.

818
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,340
I was worried that I might
drop the money while playing..

819
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,960
..so I didn't carry any money with me.

820
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,800
See..

821
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,060
This is known as knowing
the value of money.

822
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,820
This is not being money minded.

823
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,860
Then you will save a
lot of your husband's money.

824
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,820
Why?

825
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,980
He'd save his money
and I'll save mine.

826
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,180
Strange!
What kind of a girl are you?

827
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,780
You don't even love your husband?

828
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,500
How does this concern love?

829
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,760
Love doesn't feed you.

830
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,860
By the way, I am starving.
Can we have something to eat?

831
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,120
You want Fried Bread?

832
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,700
Yuck!
I don't want anything that oily.

833
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,920
My mother says that
one should look healthy.

834
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,460
You should eat more, you look weak.

835
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,720
To be slim is not a disease.

836
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,180
Fitness is in fashion.

837
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,400
Then someone should
say that to the poor..

838
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
..who keep complaining
that they are weak..

839
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
"Bro, it's fashion!"

840
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
You talk a lot.
Don't you ever get tired?

841
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,880
Made in Amritsar.

842
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,400
Oh I see. What's the name
of the hospital where you were born?

843
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,900
At home, with the help of a midwife.

844
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,960
Shall I get you something to eat?

845
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,220
Please.

846
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,920
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

847
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,900
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.

848
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,880
Thank you.

849
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,020
Hello?
Simmi, it's Reet.

850
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,220
Whose number is this?

851
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,500
Did you get his number?

852
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,100
- Here, talk to him.
- Okay.

853
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,980
Reet, with whose permission
did you go to Amritsar?

854
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,900
Mom?

855
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,920
If you didn't want to marry him,
you should have told us.

856
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,600
Why did you have
to create a scene here?

857
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,460
Do you always have to insult us?

858
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,940
Like you would have
agreed if I'd said no?

859
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,180
You were making preparations
without my consent!

860
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,780
I know what's good and bad for you.
I am your mother!

861
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,900
Mom, please just give
me that Amritsari's number.

862
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,920
You should come back to Chandigarh
right away! Understood?

863
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,700
I don't want to marry him.

864
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,760
Are you crazy, Simmi?
I told you not to tell mom!

865
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,240
I couldn't help it. She just showed up.
Anyway, take his number!

866
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,020
Tell me.

867
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,320
9372624291.

868
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,740
Thank you.

869
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Here, have some Amritsari Kulchas.

870
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,760
No, thank you.

871
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,040
I stood in a queue and
brought them especially for you.

872
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,380
You should at least
have a few of them.

873
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,280
Please stop talking.

874
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,040
I want some Peace (Shanti)

875
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,680
- I brought these from Shanti!
- Oh shut up!

876
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,880
Here, you can have them.

877
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,340
Please take them.

878
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,640
Enjoy.

879
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,480
Why don't you silence him as well?

880
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,720
Let him crow, you keep quiet.

881
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,220
Let me think in peace.

882
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,900
If he flies away then
I too will stop talking.

883
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,380
People of Chandigarh
come so far to think.

884
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,940
We usually do the
thinking on the commode.

885
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,680
No matter whatever
noises keep disturbing us.

886
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,120
Keep quiet for five minutes.

887
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,520
I don't know what to do now.

888
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,320
Mom knows everything.

889
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,160
It's not like your mother
would tell everyone in the locality.

890
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,400
Anyway, you know your mother better.

891
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,240
Don't you ever get upset?

892
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,980
Look, I won't lie.

893
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,720
I have been set with alcohol
after 8 a number of times.

894
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,660
But I have never been upset.

895
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,720
By the way, I've seen you get upset.

896
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,520
You must be mistaken.

897
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,400
We've just met.
When did you see me get upset?

898
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,800
When we got separated in the market.

899
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,480
You weren't upset when
you couldn't find me?

900
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,620
Why would I be upset?

901
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,280
Are you sure?

902
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,540
You feel so because
you are very upset.

903
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,720
You tend to manage
a lot of things at once.

904
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,180
You think something, you say
something and you show something else.

905
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,300
I don't do anything of
the three things you said.

906
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,120
I am not as smart as I look.

907
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,220
You are over smart.

908
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,500
Actually, it is not your fault.

909
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,400
This is the problem with
all the people of Amritsar.

910
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,760
They never express their feelings.

911
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,220
If you felt upset then you did.

912
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,900
It's not a big deal. Say it.

913
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,920
Yes, I was upset.

914
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,840
What's there to express in that?

915
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,240
What if you would have gotten lost?

916
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:23,960
Then?

917
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,860
Then it would have
been an insult of Amritsar.

918
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,240
Police would have questioned me.

919
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,220
'We saw the girl having coffee
with you on the CCTV camera.'

920
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,060
'Where did she go?'

921
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,400
Fine, don't accept it.

922
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,100
But there is something
going on in your heart.

923
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,820
There is a hole in my heart.
Saw it?

924
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,040
Listen to her blabber.

925
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,760
She keeps talking
about the same thing.

926
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,400
I don't like girls like you.

927
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,720
- Arrogant much!
- What do you mean?

928
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,620
I mean I don't like them.

929
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,800
Stop, stop, stop.
Give me your hand.

930
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,400
Why should I give you my hand?
I am not going to marry you.

931
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,060
- I need your hand to help come down.
- Oh, for that.

932
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,920
Come on.

933
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,240
Why don't you like girls like me?

934
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,920
Well, I just don't like them.
I am a person of high level.

935
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,060
Oh.

936
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,100
That's why the girl
cried when you got closer.

937
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,780
It was because it was the first time.

938
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,900
What about the second time?

939
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,140
Don't I have anything else to do?
I am a well-cultured boy.

940
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,440
That means she cried
the second time as well.

941
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,600
Second time it was another girl.

942
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,900
What!

943
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,600
Things didn't get so far!

944
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,640
How many girls have you had?

945
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,180
Officially, just one.

946
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,240
Give me an extra small size.

947
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,560
You mentioned one earlier,
the one who cried.

948
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,200
Don't count her. She cried.

949
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,400
Tell me the second girl's name.

950
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,800
It doesn't matter?
Enjoy the Golgappas (snacks).

951
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,740
I'll eat the Golgappas from my mouth.

952
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,880
I'll be listening to her name
through my ears. Tell me her name.

953
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,000
I'll be using my mouth
to say her name, won't I?

954
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,240
Let me eat them.

955
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,720
Anyway, the name doesn't matter.

956
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,540
Well, that reminds me,
what is your name?

957
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,340
Don't change the topic.

958
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,140
This is the problem
with the people of Amritsar.

959
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,720
You always give weird replies.

960
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,580
Tell me her name.

961
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,460
Sungchi.

962
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,460
What's that?

963
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,340
A girl's name.

964
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,220
- Sorry.
- Here.

965
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,860
What's so funny?

966
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,480
Let's go.

967
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,180
Where did you meet her?

968
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,240
In Amritsar.

969
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,020
A Chinese girl in Amritsar?

970
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,060
Yes, she was here to
do a research on Punjabi folk.

971
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,060
Then?

972
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,140
Then I helped her.

973
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,440
Was she beautiful?

974
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,160
She was hot.

975
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,200
Small eyes..

976
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,580
A beautiful smile..

977
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,040
Long hair..

978
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,300
Intoxicating gait..

979
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,040
How did you manage
To understand her language?

980
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,320
There is no language of love.

981
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,960
I know she had small eyes,
but we spoke a lot through our eyes.

982
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,260
How sweet!

983
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,900
By the way, who was the
one who fell in love first?

984
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,160
It was me.

985
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,660
Then she followed suit an hour or so.

986
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,500
How did you manage to impress her?

987
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,780
Girls are usually dumb,
but she was smart.

988
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,640
She liked my songs.

989
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,400
- You can sing?
- I write as well.

990
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,140
Not bad!

991
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,400
Why don't you sing something
that you wrote for her?

992
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,600
Should I?

993
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,700
Come on.

994
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:41,080
"Her forehead shines.."

995
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,660
"Like a bright sun."

996
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:49,220
"Oh her smile.."

997
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,680
"Oh her smile.."

998
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,060
"It is a killer."

999
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,900
"I fell for her gait.."

1000
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,880
"I fell for her gait.."

1001
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,320
"She looks are deadly."

1002
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,120
"She looks are deadly."

1003
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:50,980
"Not even a hundred moons
can match up to her brightness.."

1004
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,420
"A glimpse of her.."

1005
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:04,360
"A glimpse of her feels
like possessing the Kohinoor."

1006
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,240
"She gives you such a high.."

1007
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,480
"She gives you such a high.."

1008
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,380
"She's something
you can never forget."

1009
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,900
"She's something
you can never forget."

1010
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,720
That's it?
Why didn't you finish the song?

1011
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,980
The feelings aren't awake as yet.

1012
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,360
When they are,
the whole song will be out.

1013
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,560
By the way, you sing quite well.

1014
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,420
It is hard to find
such boys these days..

1015
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,540
The one who write songs for girls.

1016
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,980
No, many write but girls don't listen.

1017
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,520
Why?

1018
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,800
Girls value money more
than a boy's feelings.

1019
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,280
And what is wrong in that?
Every girl wants security.

1020
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,740
Do boys run on government subsidy?

1021
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,540
It is not so. But everyone
asks that question these days.

1022
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,380
I am sure Sungchi must have asked it as
well. What are your plans for the future.

1023
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,960
Yes, I had told her.

1024
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,420
That after marriage
I'd like to have two kids.

1025
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,100
That's family planning, we are
talking about future planning here.

1026
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,460
He wants kids.

1027
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:18,100
Everyone asks how much do you make?
How educated are you?

1028
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,200
Look at me and tell me,
how educated do I look?

1029
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,160
Let it be.

1030
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,320
You'll insult me again.
Let's go.

1031
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,760
- What work do you do?
- Whatever I come across.

1032
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,160
I increase the like counts
on the Facebook pages..

1033
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,600
..and views on YouTube for Punjabi artists.

1034
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,880
What kind of a job is that?

1035
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,940
The whole of Punjabi
industry is dependent on it.

1036
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,000
Punjabi industry reminds me..

1037
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,180
We needed to increase the like count
on Binnu Dhillon's Facebook page.

1038
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,240
- Bhola?
- Yes, bro?

1039
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,100
Binnu Dhillon has uploaded
a picture on Facebook.

1040
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,660
Put a few hundred comments on it.

1041
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,000
'Hot, dashing, amazing!'

1042
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,560
'Bro, you look great!'

1043
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,620
Bro, it's a very bad picture.

1044
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,400
I am not asking you
to find a match for him.

1045
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,660
We have been paid for 10,000 likes.

1046
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,220
- Get to work.
- Okay, brother.

1047
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,800
Do you want us to increase
the like count for you?

1048
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,820
- No, thanks.
- People already like me a lot.

1049
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,900
That is true.

1050
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,760
So, did you manage to turn
Sungchi into Sungchi Kaur?

1051
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:16,880
No.

1052
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,400
You made her cry as well?

1053
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,920
She left on her own.

1054
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,700
You didn't fall for anyone else?

1055
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,120
Didn't find anyone
who is like Sungchi.

1056
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,560
You didn't find any or
you didn't look at anyone else?

1057
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:48,400
We can control everything
in our life except for our heart.

1058
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,880
By the way, you don't
look as emotional as you are.

1059
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,780
Now do you expect me to listen
to sad songs like hopeless lovers?

1060
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,400
Bygones are bygones.

1061
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,700
Move on.

1062
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,820
Okay tell me,
have you ever been in love?

1063
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,000
It's getting late.

1064
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,200
My train leaves in the evening.

1065
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,780
Now after make me spill my heart out
you can only think about your train?

1066
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,140
Wait!

1067
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Where are you running away?
Come on, tell me.

1068
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,980
You don't have to make
your heart fall, it just happens.

1069
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,980
I knew you must have
done something revolting..

1070
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,300
..because of which you have
some to say not to the Amritsari.

1071
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,000
- It is not so.
- It is so.

1072
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,060
It is your fault and you
are blaming my city for it.

1073
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,020
By the way,
what do you know about our Amritsar?

1074
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,660
Prince is from Amritsar.

1075
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,560
Prince?

1076
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,700
Boyfriend.

1077
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,680
Oh.

1078
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,220
Then you better reject this boy.

1079
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,600
Otherwise, you'd ruin your husband's
life and have coffee with your boyfriend.

1080
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,220
- Not everything is a joke.
- This is not a joke.

1081
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:53,940
I know such cases quite well.

1082
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,400
If a person meets his or
her old lover after your marriage..

1083
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,080
..then it is no less than
a reason to celebrate for them.

1084
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,980
Please stop saying
such rubbish things!

1085
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,960
Nonsense!

1086
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,400
- Who is nonsense?
- You are!

1087
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,000
I know that, but why?

1088
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,920
Why shouldn't I?
You have been only troubling me.

1089
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,900
You are asking why I came
here to reject the Amritsari?

1090
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,580
This is why I have come to reject him!

1091
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,700
You don't need to reject him!

1092
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,040
I'll go and tell him that
I've checked you out on his behalf!

1093
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,240
You are a girl without manners,
you are worthless!

1094
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,020
Now I will be the one
who will call off your wedding.

1095
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,400
She too started crying?

1096
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,240
Please calm down.

1097
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,400
Please don't cry.

1098
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,420
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1099
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,380
It will be bad for my record.

1100
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,180
People will say that
I make every girl cry.

1101
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,400
Please.

1102
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,560
You were right.

1103
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,080
I am nonsense.

1104
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,760
I have a habit of just blurting out.

1105
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,900
I cannot just stop joking.

1106
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,080
You said what you
actually thought about me.

1107
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Now don't try to cover up.

1108
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,340
All the boys are the same.

1109
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,840
It is my fault.

1110
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,820
What do you mean by all?

1111
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,000
I mean all. Even Prince.

1112
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,480
- Oh. You cried because of him?
- Yes.

1113
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,080
I thought I made you cry.

1114
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,700
Couples keep have such small tiffs.

1115
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,020
Tell me something,
who do we fight with?

1116
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,860
I can fight with anyone.

1117
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,760
Come here.

1118
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,960
- Bro, please leave.
- Let me fight!

1119
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,500
Who fights with a stranger?

1120
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,280
Tell me, who do we fight with?

1121
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,760
I don't know.

1122
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,960
The one we love.

1123
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,140
The one we believe wouldn't leave us.

1124
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,440
Why are you saying that to me?

1125
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,380
To get you into a better mood.

1126
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,880
To calm you down.

1127
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Prince too must be doing the same.

1128
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,300
Prince is no longer a part of my life.

1129
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,700
We used to fight a lot.

1130
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,680
No matter whose fault it was, I
am the one who had to always give in.

1131
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,740
I am the one who used to say sorry.

1132
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,860
He never realised his mistake.

1133
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,220
No guilt at all.

1134
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,040
But, its ok.

1135
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,140
I too am a human being.
I too get hurt.

1136
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,460
- Then?
- Then what?

1137
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,400
It broke in such a way that I didn't
feel like making things right again.

1138
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,940
I came back.

1139
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,180
I thought this time
he will come to cajole me.

1140
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,900
But he didn't.

1141
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,920
Boys have a lot of ego.

1142
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,700
And I value my self respect.

1143
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,120
So, I didn't go to him either.

1144
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,720
Anyway, forget it,
why are we talking about this?

1145
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,160
Hey..

1146
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,060
Why are you getting so emotional?

1147
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,660
I am not a helpless girl.

1148
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,500
And please don't offer
me your shoulder like boys..

1149
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,060
..usually do when
they see a girl crying.

1150
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,740
I can take care of myself.

1151
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,780
Come on!

1152
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,760
Let's go, we are getting late.

1153
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,840
I don't understand,
when you know relationships so well..

1154
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,740
..then why didn't you
get married to Sungchi?

1155
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,540
I told her to leave.

1156
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,260
I will come across many like you.

1157
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,980
But you didn't look at anyone else.

1158
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,420
Can I give you a compliment?

1159
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,960
That I have a beautiful smile?

1160
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,680
No.

1161
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,440
When you smile,
you look over beautiful.

1162
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,060
Why did you leave Sungchi?

1163
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,640
She was Chinese.

1164
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,600
So?

1165
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,480
Dad said that Chinese
goods don't last long.

1166
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,440
She is not goods, she is a girl.

1167
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,500
Dad addresses them as goods.

1168
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,700
You have a way with words.

1169
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,000
Sungchi said we would
stay separately after marriage.

1170
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,460
Without my parents.

1171
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,760
She is right.
What is wrong with that?

1172
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,480
All of them are the same.

1173
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,120
It is better to get separated before
you start fighting after marriage.

1174
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,540
You want me to break an old
relationship to form a new one?

1175
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,620
Even the girl leaves her home.

1176
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,660
It is an old tradition.

1177
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,800
It is we who have
created this tradition.

1178
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,140
Let's make a new tradition.

1179
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,780
Both the girl and the
boy leave their homes.

1180
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,200
You have lost your mind.

1181
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,720
So both girl and the boy
will cry after the wedding ceremony.

1182
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,920
People will say that if you
both are crying after the wedding..

1183
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,920
..then what is the
use of getting married?

1184
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,940
Better if you stay in your respective houses.

1185
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,700
I didn't ask you leave your families.

1186
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,840
Festivals, functions or at the time of need...

1187
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,040
We can go over to their place
or they can come to our place.

1188
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,560
Then it is not like a home anymore. It
is like a girl visiting her parental home.

1189
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,540
We do that.

1190
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,940
Why don't you do something
which you expect the girl to do?

1191
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,520
You mean to say we should
leave the one who brought us up..

1192
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,640
..nurtured us,
educated us only for your sake?

1193
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,140
Girls are brought up with more affection
then boys are because they are sensitive.

1194
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,620
Yet they leave their home.

1195
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,000
Then let them stay in their home.

1196
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,660
You have changed the topic.

1197
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,700
Fine then.

1198
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,080
People are right when they
say that you should marry..

1199
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,000
..the one with whom
your thinking matches.

1200
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Good that Sungchi didn't
get married to you.

1201
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,080
Prince was better off than
Sungchi because he left you.

1202
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,340
What did you say?

1203
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,660
Girls like you are the
reasons why families get ruined.

1204
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,700
If all boys think like you
do then no girl should marry them.

1205
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,460
I think you boys
should marry each other.

1206
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,600
It's legal now.

1207
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,200
I doubted that you want a girl.

1208
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,960
That's why you are
rejecting this alliance.

1209
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:46,360
Shut up. It must be your turn
to bat again, please get lost.

1210
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,400
I will pull apart the
pillion seat of my motorbike.

1211
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,720
If there is no pillion seat,
no girl like you would sit on it.

1212
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:06,280
"You've celebrated enough, it's
time to shed tears in solitude now."

1213
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,720
"I tried to reason it with you,
but you were being stubborn."

1214
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:26,520
"You should have thought
about this before falling in love."

1215
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,060
"Oh my heart,
now get back to the life.."

1216
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,520
"..which you lived before
she came into our life."

1217
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,380
"Oh my heart,
now get back to the life.."

1218
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:46,620
"..which you lived before
she came into our life."

1219
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,800
"Don't fall for it.
Don't make yourself yearn."

1220
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,220
"Don't trust love."

1221
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:02,940
"She took along the dreams
which I saw with her."

1222
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,220
"You are only left
with my shattered dreams."

1223
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,400
"She took along the dreams
which I saw with her."

1224
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,980
"You are only left
with my shattered dreams."

1225
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,400
"The life you were living
before you set eyes on her.."

1226
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,120
"Oh my heart,
now get back to the life.."

1227
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,900
"..which you lived before
she came into our life."

1228
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,060
Hey bro, forget batting..

1229
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,380
And go get the girl.

1230
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,340
"Don't fall for it.
Don't make yourself yearn."

1231
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,340
"Don't trust love."

1232
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,480
"You will be separated from those
that you want to always stay with.

1233
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,400
"Situation hasn't changed,
you are in the same state again."

1234
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,600
"You will be separated from those
that you want to always stay with.

1235
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,400
"Situation hasn't changed,
you are in the same state again."

1236
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,580
"The state you were in before
the joy entered your life."

1237
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,400
"Oh my heart,
now get back to the life.."

1238
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:39,040
"..which you lived before
she came into our life."

1239
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,120
I sat alone and gave it a thought.

1240
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,300
What you said and what you
meant were two different things.

1241
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,680
You aren't asking
us to leave our parents..

1242
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,880
..you want an equal relationship.

1243
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,920
Even boys should do
what the girls can do.

1244
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,940
Sorry.

1245
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,080
Thank you for understanding me.

1246
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,740
It is not about staying
together or getting separated.

1247
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,740
It is about love.

1248
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,600
Thank you.

1249
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:39,060
Sage! Sage! Sage!

1250
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,380
Sage, please give me your blessings.

1251
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,020
I don't know what is wrong.
I am in a lot of trouble.

1252
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,780
Passengers run away from my rickshaw
after travelling only a short distance.

1253
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,800
- Passengers run away?
- Yes.

1254
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,360
I haven't made a rupee since morning.
I have already been slapped five times.

1255
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,680
- Slapped?
- I am going crazy. What do I tell you?

1256
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,080
There's something in it.

1257
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,460
That's why I have come to you.

1258
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,640
I have not come here
to make you grease the wheels.

1259
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,780
Tell me something, did you
pass over a lemon this morning?

1260
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,840
Yes, I had gone to
the vegetable market.

1261
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,400
There were potatoes,
eggplants, cauliflower, okra...

1262
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,720
Lemons too must surely be there.
There is no ban on them.

1263
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,880
That's it.

1264
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,600
A ghost left a lemon
and possessed your rickshaw.

1265
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,680
- A ghost?
- She won't let anyone else sit on it now.

1266
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,540
Lemons have ghost in them?

1267
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,160
Sage! Sage, please help me.

1268
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,700
My wife and my kids
will starve to death.

1269
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,060
- Sage!
- Tell me.

1270
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,000
Come home early this evening,
we have to attend a wedding tonight.

1271
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,700
Whatever you say.

1272
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:41,320
I also need a new dress.

1273
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,740
You will get that as well.

1274
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:47,060
Sage, please tell me how
do I get rid of this ghost.

1275
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,980
Don't worry, I just spoke to her.

1276
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:50,860
You spoke to her? What did she say?

1277
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,400
She wants a new dress.

1278
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,800
A new dress..

1279
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,820
My wife has a new sari. Will that work?
Talk to her.

1280
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,740
Would a sari do?

1281
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:06,520
No, no, no,
I want an embroidered palazzo. Bye.

1282
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,240
She wants palazzo pants,
that too embroidered.

1283
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,980
I have only been slapped today.

1284
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,840
I'll give it tomorrow after I make
some money. I promise. Talk to her.

1285
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,000
No one knows what tomorrow holds.

1286
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,340
She wants to wear the dress tonight.

1287
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,840
She will start possessing
me in the evening.

1288
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,480
A lemon is causing me a lot of damage.

1289
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,560
Don't worry. I'll handle the situation
today with the help of a dress.

1290
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,060
Watch out for lemons in future.

1291
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,140
- Sage!
- Go.

1292
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,080
- Can I go now?
- Yes.

1293
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,520
Take a right from here.

1294
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,640
What happened?

1295
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,820
Take right.

1296
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:51,640
- Right from there.
- Okay.

1297
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,020
Right, right, right.

1298
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,380
Wait, wait,
wait, go slow, I'll tell you.

1299
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,400
Keep going straight.

1300
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,140
Stop, stop, stop!

1301
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:13,400
- Stop!
- What happened?

1302
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,400
What's wrong?

1303
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,400
Run, run, run!

1304
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,400
- Why? Whose house is that?
- Prince's house!

1305
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,060
Prince!

1306
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,900
What are you doing?
Let's run away.

1307
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,280
- Let me be of service as well.
- Hey!

1308
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:40,100
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

1309
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,520
- Go! Go! Go!
- Okay, okay, okay.

1310
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,900
"You entered my life like a new dawn."

1311
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,400
"You dreams are mine, from now."

1312
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,020
"I will declare it to the world..."

1313
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:29,680
"I will declare it to the world...
I am in love."

1314
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,820
"Whether or not you agree beautiful,
God has brought us together."

1315
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:39,800
"God has brought us together."

1316
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:47,600
"Whether or not you agree my darling,
God has brought us together."

1317
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,400
"God has brought us together."

1318
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,920
"You are the one I always
want before my eyes."

1319
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,080
"I'll make all promises
expected and follow all orders."

1320
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,800
"You are the one I always
want before my eyes."

1321
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,960
"I'll make all promises
expected and follow all orders."

1322
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,960
"Follow all orders."

1323
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,840
"My love for you is true."

1324
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,040
"My love for you is true."

1325
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,960
"I have learnt its true value."

1326
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:55,880
"Whether or not you agree beautiful,
God has brought us together."

1327
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,740
"God has brought us together."

1328
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:03,860
"Whether or not you agree my darling,
God has brought us together."

1329
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,700
"God has brought us together."

1330
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:21,900
"Whether or not you agree beautiful,
God has brought us together."

1331
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,420
"God has brought us together."

1332
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:31,400
"Whether or not you agree beautiful,
God has brought us together."

1333
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
"God has brought us together."

1334
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:39,680
"Whether or not you agree beautiful,
God has brought us together."

1335
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,180
I'm getting a call.

1336
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,480
It got disconnected.

1337
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,740
It was Bhola.

1338
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,880
I'll call him later.

1339
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,740
Can I use your phone?

1340
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,620
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1341
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,560
- He didn't answer it?
- It's busy.

1342
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,760
Who knows, he might be
trying to call on your number.

1343
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,000
Anyway, forget it.

1344
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,880
By the way, I'd thought that..

1345
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,500
..I'd surely go to Golden temple
when I reached Amritsar.

1346
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,620
How far is it?

1347
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:34,140
If you close your eyes,
it's right in front.

1348
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,580
Otherwise, 15 to 20 minutes.

1349
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,780
But we need to buy you a
Punjabi dress before we go there.

1350
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:40,920
We'll take you there
as a Punjabi Jatti.

1351
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,060
Fine, let's go.

1352
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,360
What happened?

1353
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:09,060
I need to buy a dress,
please get rid of this lemon.

1354
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,600
This lemon won't harm you. Go inside.

1355
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,320
Are you going to remove
it or shall I go to another shop?

1356
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,360
I'll remove it, go inside.

1357
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,480
It is not my fault, I am doing it for you.

1358
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,400
Go inside.

1359
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,000
Go on.

1360
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,980
- Greetings!
- Yes, what do you want?

1361
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,220
Show me a palazzo, a cheap one.

1362
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,300
But it should be embroidered.

1363
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,280
A palazzo? Of what size?

1364
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,600
Size?

1365
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,760
How do I tell?

1366
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,940
I haven't seen the one
who is going to wear it.

1367
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:51,460
Give me one in free size.

1368
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,640
- Sonu!
- Yes, sir?

1369
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,760
Get the palazzo of the latest fashion.

1370
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,120
Jacqueline style.

1371
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,400
Here.

1372
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,180
How much is it for?

1373
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:08,520
Rs.2000 each.

1374
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,680
Rs.2000!

1375
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,980
Give me a minute.

1376
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:14,980
Do you want this one or this one?

1377
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,100
Tell me.

1378
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,800
Please tell me which one do you want.

1379
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,800
This one or that one?

1380
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,400
Please..

1381
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,720
Where are you going?

1382
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,480
- I'm going in to try them out.
- They are meant for ladies.

1383
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,980
- Okay, okay, okay.
- He is crazy.

1384
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,900
Have you ever seen such a big shop
that sells Punjabi dresses in Chandigarh?

1385
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:40,820
No.

1386
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,480
People there don't wear them.

1387
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,220
Brother,
show us a nice Amritsari dress.

1388
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:47,020
- Right away, sir. Please have a seat.
- Yes.

1389
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,620
Jyot, get Amritsar's special dresses.

1390
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,420
Give them to me.

1391
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,440
Amritsar's special dresses.

1392
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:54,940
Wonderful.

1393
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,880
I like this one. What say?

1394
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,760
It will suit you.

1395
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,440
- Should I try it out?
- Yes.

1396
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,080
Where's the trial room?

1397
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:08,040
That one's occupied.

1398
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,380
This one is empty now.

1399
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,620
- You can try it over here.
- Okay.

1400
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,500
I'll be right back.

1401
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,100
How do I look?

1402
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,020
Like someone dear.

1403
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,220
You look like a local because
you are wearing an Amritsari dress.

1404
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,900
Can I use your phone?

1405
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,100
It's with you.

1406
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:01,240
Sorry.

1407
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,660
Again busy.

1408
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,020
He likes to talk a lot.

1409
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:17,240
Tell me something, this
way will take you to the station..

1410
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,980
..and that way leads
to Chowk Chabutara.

1411
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:20,200
Where do you want to go?

1412
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,380
Can we go and have a coffee?

1413
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,100
Why just a coffee,
we can order two cups of coffee.

1414
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:38,940
You said that there
are many coffee shops here.

1415
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:39,840
Yet you brought me to the same one.

1416
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,400
There are many but this
one is a little special.

1417
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,700
Special..

1418
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,100
He parked right in front of us.

1419
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,400
Let's go.

1420
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,120
You've come to my city and
you'll leave without meeting me?

1421
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:01,980
Who is he?

1422
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,840
Why are you asking her? Ask me.

1423
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,660
I'll tell you who
I am in great detail.

1424
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:10,560
I too give a deadly
introduction of myself.

1425
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,540
Prince, you should leave.

1426
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,220
- I don't want to create a scene over here.
- Who is he?

1427
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,460
He is Prince?

1428
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:19,040
What hit you here,
a stone or a brick?

1429
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,220
A brick. Why?

1430
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,720
My brick.

1431
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,740
Prince..

1432
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,920
Leave.

1433
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,140
Who is he?

1434
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:26,480
Tell him who I am.

1435
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,600
Sorry, I really don't
know who you are.

1436
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,180
I don't even know your name.

1437
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,120
Look at yourself.

1438
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,520
You are roaming around
with someone you don't even know.

1439
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,580
And then you accuse
me of being wrong.

1440
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,480
I am roaming around
with a stranger..

1441
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,920
..because he is better
than people that I know.

1442
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,320
I want to talk to you.

1443
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,400
Didn't you hear her?

1444
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,820
She said this stranger is
much better than people she knows.

1445
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:55,060
She won't talk to you. Buzz off.

1446
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:56,300
Please.

1447
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,120
This is my personal matter.

1448
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,800
Let me decide who I should
and shouldn't talk to.

1449
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:06,720
Go inside.

1450
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:20,240
You wait here,
I'll go and talk to him.

1451
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,360
Why do you need to talk to him?

1452
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,240
Why are you so upset?

1453
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,620
What if he manages to cajole you?

1454
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:28,920
How would that affect you?

1455
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:35,000
Look, Prince has come here.

1456
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,220
Now I will have to
talk things out with him.

1457
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,600
I am a girl from Chandigarh.

1458
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,920
I am neither afraid of any situation
nor do I run away from one.

1459
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,180
I'll be right back.

1460
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,920
You always came to cajole me.

1461
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,400
I thought you'd come
this time as well.

1462
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:15,760
Anything else?

1463
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,740
I didn't know that
it would hurt you so much.

1464
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,160
Now you know?

1465
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,120
Forget it. I am sorry.

1466
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,060
It's okay.

1467
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:42,700
Can I leave now?

1468
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,480
What is wrong with you?

1469
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,340
When two people are in a relationship,
they tend to make mistakes.

1470
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,680
I made one as well.

1471
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,620
Our relationship
only consisted of you.

1472
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,400
I was nowhere a part of it.

1473
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,820
I promise to change myself.

1474
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,080
Ma'am..

1475
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:03,160
Thank you.

1476
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:08,360
Sir, you are waiting outside?

1477
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,880
Madam is inside.
You too should come in.

1478
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,420
Yes, she is sitting
with her brother.

1479
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,260
She is talking to him
about our relationship.

1480
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,340
About your relationship?

1481
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:17,680
Best of luck, sir.

1482
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,760
Shall I get coffee for you?

1483
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,940
No, I am okay.

1484
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,880
- You should go and ask them.
- Okay, sir.

1485
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:29,360
If I go back to you,
you'd be as you were.

1486
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,280
No, I won't.
Give me a chance.

1487
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,400
Try to understand, Prince.

1488
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,940
A person's basic
nature never changes.

1489
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:39,920
You are pleading me
because I am not with you.

1490
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,580
You would have never been
this polite if I had been with you.

1491
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,320
Why don't you understand?

1492
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,120
I really love you a lot.

1493
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,340
If you don't believe
me then ask my friends.

1494
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,160
Wonderful.

1495
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,340
You are the one who loves me
and your friends will vouch for it.

1496
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,980
It was in front of them
that I'd slit my wrist.

1497
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,240
- Ma'am, what should I get for you?
- No, thanks.

1498
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,780
And for your brother?

1499
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,880
Run away before I hit you.

1500
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:05,940
Sorry, sir.

1501
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:09,720
Fine, let's do one thing.

1502
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,780
You don't say yes
to someone just yet.

1503
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,840
Let's give our relationship
another six months.

1504
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,300
You can say yes to me
when you start believing in me.

1505
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,580
Sir, I don't think
it will work out for you.

1506
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,640
Her brother is very angry.

1507
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,420
It is a good thing that he is angry.

1508
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:40,400
Would you like it
if I consume poison?

1509
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,640
They are calling out to you.

1510
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:49,200
Oh..

1511
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,980
Sorry, I don't know how it happened.

1512
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,540
- You should go and dry..
- Who was calling out to me over there?

1513
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,180
Oh, he was calling out to them.
I am so sorry.

1514
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,560
You should go and dry your clothes.

1515
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,400
Go on. Don't worry,
I'll wait for you over here.

1516
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,580
- Go and dry your clothes. Okay.- Thank God
it wasn't tea. She would have burned me.

1517
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,720
Reet!

1518
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,160
Run, run, run!

1519
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,360
Not there, on your motorbike!

1520
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,720
We got to hurry, we got to hurry!

1521
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,220
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

1522
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,840
You said you don't run away.

1523
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,400
Go! Go! Go!

1524
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,560
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!
Go, go, go!

1525
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,100
You got scared and
started to run away!

1526
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,660
I am not scared.
I just feel that fighting doesn't help.

1527
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,400
Rickshaw!

1528
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,780
- Rickshaw!
- Yes, sir.

1529
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,400
Rickshaw!

1530
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,280
Yes.

1531
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,960
- I want to go to the hospital.
- Okay.

1532
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,400
Have a seat, sir.

1533
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,800
Drive slowly.

1534
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,720
I suffer from slip disc.

1535
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,080
Don't worry, sir.
I will drive at zero speed.

1536
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,040
A passenger is like God.

1537
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,960
You will think that
you are in Mercy car.

1538
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,720
- Mercedes?
- Yes, exactly.

1539
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,520
- Have you settled down, sir?
- Yes.

1540
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,540
- Is this speed fine?
- Yes.

1541
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:34,860
That's it.

1542
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,400
This speed is fine?

1543
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,740
- It is fine, maintain this speed.
- Okay, you don't worry.

1544
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,400
Stop, stop...

1545
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,280
She has brought a Sardar-ji
along to beat me up.

1546
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,180
Stop!

1547
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:57,420
Hello!

1548
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:58,660
Don't stop, take a U-turn.

1549
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,320
I don't think Prince is a good
person. You should rethink about this.

1550
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,720
It's not him, it's my phone!

1551
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,820
Turn around,
turn around, turn around!

1552
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:12,040
Before you kill me, at least
tell me what crime have I committed?

1553
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,440
At least
tell me what crime have I committed!

1554
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,400
Tell me if I have ever hit you!

1555
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,400
What have I done wrong!

1556
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,960
No! Driver!

1557
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,360
Stop, stop.

1558
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,400
Why did you stop?
I asked you to follow him.

1559
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,920
There is flour all around,
my bike will get dirty.

1560
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,400
Drive from the side then. Let's go.

1561
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,480
Follow him!

1562
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,540
Stop!

1563
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:50,080
- Stop, stop...
- Drive fast.

1564
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,240
Brother, please.

1565
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,400
Behave yourself and
give me your licence.

1566
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,660
- I just need to go over there.
- Give me your licence.

1567
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,400
Give me the money. Pay up, come on!
- Move aside..

1568
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:58,780
Move aside..

1569
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:02,060
Move aside..

1570
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:04,520
Move!

1571
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,180
Stop the rickshaw.

1572
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:10,640
Why should I listen to
you when I don't even know you?

1573
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,860
- I'll tell you who I am!
- Now I will never stop.

1574
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:16,460
I am well respected in this area.
Please be a brother and stop.

1575
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,780
Take something and compromise.
Take some money from me.

1576
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,780
- No, no, no. I don't want money.
- Brother, please..

1577
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,480
You being a police officer
are trying to bribe me?

1578
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,400
Don't you have any shame?
For God's sake let me get off it.

1579
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,400
Drive faster!
Hold on.

1580
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,400
Move side.

1581
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,400
Let me just get hold of you!

1582
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:38,460
If I don't make you pay for
this then I am not Daljit Singh!

1583
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,880
Move aside!

1584
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:47,020
Lord, please help me.

1585
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:48,400
Save me.

1586
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,800
True Lord, help me.

1587
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,380
Minister will entering in your area,
block the all roads.

1588
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,240
Okay, sir!

1589
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,400
Don't stop! Keep going!

1590
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,200
- Move fast.
- Move back!

1591
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,320
- My phone. One minute, listen to me.
- Stay back.

1592
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,220
- My uncle is a station house officer.
- What is the name of your uncle?

1593
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,240
I just forgot his name.

1594
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,220
Move back.

1595
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:30,500
- Please let me my phone...
- Uncle is here.

1596
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,400
- Hey!
- There he is!

1597
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,140
[Prayers]

1598
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,940
Oh, my God.

1599
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,560
Now I will drop you
at the right place.

1600
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,100
- You thief!
- Stop, stop, stop!

1601
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,920
You thought that you can escape me?

1602
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,620
Brother, please hear
me out before you hit me.

1603
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,560
Are you from Amritsar?

1604
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,000
Yes.

1605
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,560
I badmouthed her when
she badmouthed Amritsar.

1606
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,020
- How is it my fault?
- Hey!

1607
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,120
Heard that?

1608
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,040
When a man from UP cannot tolerate..

1609
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,560
..someone speaking ill about
Amritsar then how can a Sardar?

1610
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,240
Well done, brother.

1611
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,100
I'm proud of you.

1612
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:07,400
You can leave, my dear.

1613
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,920
Where is my phone?

1614
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,080
- Tell me. Come on.
- I only have this phone.

1615
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,920
- This is your phone?
- I spent 1100 to buy it.

1616
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,540
- Take it.
- This is not my phone!

1617
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,660
You sold my phone!

1618
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,460
- You sold my phone!
- Give back her phone.

1619
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,840
I swear, I don't have it.

1620
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,760
Hey mister,
why is this seat vibrating?

1621
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,400
- This seat is possessed.
- It must be my phone.

1622
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,260
It is possessed by a ghost.

1623
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,860
- Found it. Great.
- I found it, I found it!

1624
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:32,920
Well done, brother.

1625
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,320
Always keep such noble
thoughts about Amritsar.

1626
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,220
Let's go, Mr. Amritsar,
or I will miss my train.

1627
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,100
Bless you.

1628
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,900
Okay.

1629
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,820
This phone was the ghost.

1630
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,400
Mr. Disc.
Sir..

1631
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:54,880
Please get up,
I'll get your discs repaired.

1632
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:58,780
Come on, sit down.

1633
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,220
Stay away!

1634
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,920
Stay away!

1635
01:29:04,060 --> 01:29:05,280
This is where I wanted to get down.

1636
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,400
- Please have a seat, sir.
- No!

1637
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,460
There are 25 minutes
for the train to come.

1638
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,100
Can you do me a favour?

1639
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:32,040
I have written on this
why I don't want to marry him.

1640
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,760
Give it to the Chabutara guy.

1641
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,260
Chowk Chabutara.

1642
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:36,260
Ok.

1643
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:40,820
Your train is about to arrive.

1644
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,240
Trains are arriving
on time these days.

1645
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,860
Silence can sometimes
be so weird, right?

1646
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:01,080
Silence, where?

1647
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:02,980
There is so much noise in here.

1648
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:06,440
People are talking,
announcements are being made.

1649
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,600
Phones are ringing.

1650
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:11,240
Okay then..

1651
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,120
Bye.

1652
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,740
Don't shake hands with me.

1653
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:18,080
I make girls cry.

1654
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:24,040
Honestly.. thank you.

1655
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,400
It was a pleasure to meet you.

1656
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,080
Same here.

1657
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,660
Bye.

1658
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:37,820
Bye.

1659
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,980
My phone.

1660
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,780
Of course.

1661
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,560
I didn't even realize.

1662
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,220
You can keep it you want,
I had found it somewhere.

1663
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,900
You shouldn't lose
the things you find.

1664
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,260
Give me your phone number.

1665
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,880
Quickly. My phone's battery
is almost drained out.

1666
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,300
Why do you need my number?

1667
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:47,760
It's not like we
are going to meet again.

1668
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,060
Just remember today's day.

1669
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:51,680
That is a smart thing to say.

1670
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,060
I am a smart person.

1671
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:54,500
I have been roaming around
with you since morning..

1672
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:56,600
..did you ever feel that I am crazy?

1673
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:00,220
Okay, did the guy who lives
at Chowk Chabutara call you?

1674
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:04,440
He didn't call and I am not
interested. Just give him that note.

1675
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,480
Forget the note,
just call him up and say no to him.

1676
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,380
No.

1677
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:12,360
After I met you, I realised
boys of Amritsar are very emotional.

1678
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,160
I won't be able to
do it over the phone.

1679
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,400
That's why I have resorted
to giving him a note.

1680
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:19,600
By the way, we have been
together since morning..

1681
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,500
..and yet we don't
know each other's name.

1682
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,840
What is your name?

1683
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:25,760
Name?

1684
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,120
#Ambersariya

1685
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,600
And what's yours?

1686
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,740
@Chandigarh Wali.

1687
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:45,000
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1688
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,280
Hello. Oh..

1689
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:03,400
Oh hi.

1690
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,440
Yes, I had gone to your house.

1691
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,700
It was locked.
Auntie told me.

1692
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,120
No, I am already
at the train station.

1693
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,320
The train leaves in 15 - 20 minutes.

1694
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:26,720
Okay fine,
let's meet outside the station.

1695
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,420
Bye.

1696
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,100
What happened?

1697
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,000
Bro, someone hacked
a few of our pages.

1698
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,800
Artists are saying that you
aren't paying attention.

1699
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,260
They want their money back.

1700
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:46,660
Where are you?

1701
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,120
I'm struggling.

1702
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,220
Hang up.

1703
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:51,280
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

1704
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,620
What are you doing here?

1705
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:55,220
He called.

1706
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:56,360
Prince?

1707
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,080
You got convinced?

1708
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,820
Not him..

1709
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,460
The Chowk Chabutara guy.

1710
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:04,080
Oh my, the Chowk Chabutara guy.

1711
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,400
You got it right this time.

1712
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,700
What did he say?

1713
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:07,680
Nothing.

1714
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,140
He wants to meet me outside the
station. He has asked me to wait.

1715
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,220
And you are waiting for him?

1716
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:12,740
There are still 15-20 minutes
left for the train to arrive.

1717
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:15,780
He sounded fine.

1718
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:18,040
I think..

1719
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,680
You might end up with him.

1720
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,680
It is not so.

1721
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,440
He called, he said let's meet.

1722
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,860
That's why I had come here.

1723
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,160
Then shall I tear the note?

1724
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,000
Your wish.

1725
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,100
Or do you want me to put it in an
amulet and hang it around my neck?

1726
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,260
She was all set to leave
for Chandigarh but she came back.

1727
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,480
Don't you over think sometimes?

1728
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:34,840
He is here!

1729
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:41,280
Someone's so excited to see him.

1730
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,640
I think you should call him..

1731
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,880
..or your train will
leave before he arrives.

1732
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,180
What happened?

1733
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:54,580
Battery drained out.

1734
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:56,240
Your phone is so troublesome.

1735
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,140
Sometimes its battery drains out,
sometimes it gets lost.

1736
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:00,720
Do one thing,
throw it so that I can pick it up.

1737
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,420
Very funny.

1738
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,360
Here, call him from my phone.

1739
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,040
His number was dialed before yours.

1740
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:14,320
'Passengers please pay attention.'

1741
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,640
- It's busy.
- ''The train from Amritsar to Chandigarh..'

1742
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,160
- '..Intercity express will leave from
platform number one in 15 minutes.'

1743
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,480
They are announcing my train.

1744
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,400
Forget it, I'll get going now.
Bye.

1745
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:29,860
Wait a minute, how does your
phone have my number in it?

1746
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,620
Forget that and tell me why
doesn't the call get connected..

1747
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:36,900
..when you dial a phone
number from its phone?

1748
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,780
Dial a phone number from its phone?

1749
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:40,820
It will never get connected.
It's impossible.

1750
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:42,240
You dialed it..

1751
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,240
..not once but twice.

1752
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:49,500
Called this phone
number from this phone.

1753
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:57,100
You said that you'd marry someone
who knows you, understands you..

1754
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:01,140
..someone with whom
your thoughts match.

1755
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,840
Look at how God plays his games.

1756
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,980
You came to me to
inquire about my address.

1757
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:13,600
I thought I won't find a
better way to know my life partner.

1758
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,540
I had agreed to marry you
just by looking at your picture.

1759
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,540
But you are more beautiful
than your photograph.

1760
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,480
Will you marry me?

1761
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:48,220
Can I say something?

1762
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,800
I shy beautifully?

1763
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:55,180
When you feel shy,
you look very beautiful.

1764
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,120
Hey Miss Arrogant..

1765
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:12,500
Before you leave at least let
me know whether it's a yes or a no.

1766
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:16,360
If we get married you will try to
act smart be calling yourself Amritsari.

1767
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,940
If we get married you
with be an Amritsari's wife.

1768
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:20,860
You too will have
the same pride as mine.

1769
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:23,500
Fine, then you too will have to
fulfill all the conditions required..

1770
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,280
..to be Chandigarh
resident's son-in-law.

1771
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,400
I'll fulfil them.

1772
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,140
First give me the guarantee that
I'd be Chandigarh resident's son-in-law.

1773
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:34,320
By the way, what are the useless
conditions of the Chandigarh residents?

1774
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,820
What do you mean by useless?

1775
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:40,320
Whatever they might be they
will be better than Amritsar's.

1776
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,260
Dream on!
I have seen how you behave!

1777
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,340
If a girl from our city
had gone to say no to someone..

1778
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:46,000
..she would have done the
job in five minutes and returned.

1779
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,200
Whereas you came in the morning
and are leaving in the evening.

1780
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,340
And yet we don't know
whether it's a yes or a no.

1781
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:51,660
Okay, so that means you are smarter.

1782
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:52,440
- No.
- Then?

1783
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,960
- You are less smart.
- We are crazy?

1784
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,860
- No.
- Then?

1785
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:55,760
You are mad.

1786
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,380
We are better than you are. We don't
all keep "inging" all the time.

1787
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:01,680
Try stopping your kids
when they to do the same.

1788
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,820
I'm going!

1789
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,720
Really..

1790
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,660
So you are "Going!"

1791
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:16,120
Going only to come back.

1792
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,200
Bye Miss Arrogant!

1793
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:46,420
"I cannot tolerate
Amritsar's popadums."

1794
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:52,260
"I cannot tolerate
Chandigarh's attitude."

1795
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,100
"I cannot tolerate
Amritsar's popadums."

1796
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:19,280
"I cannot tolerate
Chandigarh's attitude."

1797
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,600
"You cannot act brave
by just talking big."

1798
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,740
"Braggers get drunk and fight."

1799
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:25,780
"We bring the party to live."

1800
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:28,060
"Girls look at us and sigh."

1801
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:31,320
"That's why no girl
comes close to you."

1802
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,720
"I plan to get a wife from Chandigarh."

1803
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:38,120
"I cannot tolerate
Amritsar's popadums."

1804
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:41,860
"I cannot tolerate
Chandigarh's attitude."

1805
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:58,140
"I'll buy you jewelry and dresses."

1806
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:02,500
"Forget being a landlord,
you the chairman of losers."

1807
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:08,340
"You too like me.
Why don't accept it?"

1808
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:16,880
"I will never be
entering your house."

1809
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,440
"I plan to get a wife from Chandigarh."

1810
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,820
"I cannot tolerate
Amritsar's popadums."

1811
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:27,260
"I cannot tolerate
Chandigarh's attitude."
