1
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,912
Today,I'm leaving this
city

2
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,420
The city,in which I grew up
with the love of my parents

3
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,434
But there's very short distance
between Happiness & sorrows

4
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:19,766
I could understand this when I lost
everything right before my eyes

5
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,448
People say it was a communal
attack on Muslims in Indore

6
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,953
But,for me it was a communal
clash between Humanity & inhumanity

7
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,793
Here,Humanity lost

8
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:57,480
Father...

9
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:05,655
Mother...

10
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:07,488
Mother...

11
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:17,852
Mother...Mother...Mother...
Father...Mother...

12
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:26,672
Mumtaz,control yourself

13
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,857
Train has arrived come Mumtaz
...come...come on...

14
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,875
Come quickly...There's no
train after this

15
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:03,874
Move out...move out...

16
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,380
Come quickly,Mumtaz

17
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,383
Mumtaz,come quickly,there's no train
after this...come quickly

18
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,052
Why're you watching my face?
come quickly

19
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,224
There's no train after this
There's nothing left in this place

20
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,898
What're you thinking?Come quickly
-...Hey!come

21
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,396
Hey!move aside...move aside

22
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,589
My mother wished that even after
marriage I shouldn't go out of this city

23
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,265
So that I must always
be near her

24
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,428
But,what's left for me
in this city?

25
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,607
Except a few sweet memories
of the past

26
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,777
Let me see,where life's
going to take me

27
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,688
What's this Brother Abdul?
Put down your hand

28
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,862
What a bad luck I've?
- Greetings sir

29
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,525
You're great cards,friend

30
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,697
Uncle lfran

31
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:45,042
Uncle,I say all these communal clashes
are wanton acts of Politicians

32
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,211
Someone else does it and we
poor have to die for it

33
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,735
We'll get a place to stay
isn't it,Brother Iqbal

34
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:55,207
Yes,you're very fortunate that
you know me

35
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,712
That's why,I've come to Bombay
with believing you

36
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,381
Uncle,never believe anyone in Bombay
Understood?

37
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,219
I'm giving you a shanty to
live for friendship

38
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,556
Damn it,we've pay even to
urinate in Bombay,understood?

39
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,398
Hey!crow,how're you?

40
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,735
All are our boys,they all
respect me very much

41
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,397
The roof is low,come carefully

42
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:24,074
Don't worry about anything here
I'll take care of everything

43
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,417
He's our Brother Qureishi,he's
a very dangerous man

44
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,417
Earlier he used to kill people
now sells meat understood?

45
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,590
Brother Qureishi,greetings
Entire day he's very moody

46
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,933
Look,uncle,this is your
tenement

47
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,269
Stay comfortable here
Alright?

48
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,776
Iqbal,can I get some work?

49
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,107
Are you mad?

50
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,607
I didn't mean that there's
no work here

51
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,441
You'll get work,Bombay never puts
anyone to sleep on empty stomach

52
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,446
It'll take some time for
getting you work

53
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:05,614
Listen...

54
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,285
If you allow,I can get
work for your niece

55
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:17,299
In the entire Bombay
Ladies Beer Bar is a great hit

56
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,132
Beer Bar means,Liquor selling place

57
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,636
Where girls make you drink
liquor,they dance

58
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,642
And public enjoy it

59
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,479
Even one peg man will
consume 2 pegs

60
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,144
Didn't understand?

61
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,650
In older times there used be dances
by Nautch girls isn't it?

62
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,819
This is modern times
dance,disco

63
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,157
Keep it here,keep this
box here & come outwith me

64
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,490
Be ready with your niece
I'll come in the evening

65
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,322
I know,Chandini Bar's Anna
very well

66
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,831
I'll talk with him & get her
work there

67
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,835
When did you come from
Tirupathi?

68
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,843
You offered to the God,my
offerings of Rs.501 isn't it?

69
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,515
Hey,Bitch,Shabboo! Don't try
to entice my customers

70
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,191
Hey!cheap slut!now is it

71
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,351
What happened when you enticed
my Mahim man?

72

75
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,871
Anna,the thing is that she's
talking about my customers

76
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:32,701
Shut up,bitch

77
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:35,875

You just wait here

86
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,443
Tell Anna,that I've come

87
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:22,644
Greetings sir!

88
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:32,155
How're you Shabboo,Rani?
How's your furniture Man of Bandra?

89
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,154
You've eaten him away like
white ants

90
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,990
Hey!shut up!Get lost man

91
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,826

I had told you about her work
only...Anna!...that one...

95
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,200
Does she know to dance?

96
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,871
She knows!yes!she knows!

97
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,372
She knows film dances

98
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:31,382
Chamdi,do one thing,ask her to
start working from tomorrow

99
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,055
Alright sir

100
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,385

You promised to bring that
Rupa of Diamond Bar here

What happened to it?

106
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,731
Brother Anna,the bitch isn't going
to come into our hands

107
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,403

Wear these clothes & be ready
Evening we've to go to Beer Bar

00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:23,773
Uncle,I'll not go there

112
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,604
Why?

113
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,779
I don't like that place,don't know
what sort of people come there

114
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:38,118
Do you think,I like all this
But,what can we do?

115
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,782
Look,Mumtaz!This is not our place
this is Bombay city

116
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,624
Do one thing,do this work
for few days

117
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,300
As soon as I get some work
quit all this

118
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,966
Why're you doing like this?

119
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,643
If you don't work,till I get some
work,we'll die starving

120
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,975
Iqbal will throw us out of
this tenement also

121
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,815

What Rani?Has my man come?

125
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,515
Your man hasn't come,but
my old man has come

126
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,191
You like that old man
very much isn't it?

127
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,520
Yes,but that old man was your Hero
before coming to me isn't it?

128
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,361
Hey! He's just an useless
old rut

00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,032
Hey,Deepa,Shabboo,Rani

Hey!What's your name?

134
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,067
Did you elope with a lover
& came here?

135
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,746
Or did you come here after some
bad name in your native town?

136
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,080
Hey!Bitch,shut up

137
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,580
Do you think everyone will
be like you?

143
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,077
Anna,I'll go

144
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,579
Hey!who's is this No.16 box?

00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,750
Who's is this No.16 box?
This is totally empty

146
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,084
Hey!Heroine,isn't it your's
that cash box No.16?

147
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,089
Hey!Chamdi,her box is empty

148
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,929
You shouldn't have brought
such a girl here

149
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,755
Am I running an orphanage?

150
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,923
Didn't I tell you,to explain her
about rules of accounts

151
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,264
You didn't explain her,isn't it?
Bitch,she couldn't understand the hint

152
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,270
Anna,the thing is that
she's new isn't it?

153
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,602
It'll take a day or two to
pick up the hint isn't it?

154
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,104
I'll explain her

155
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,610
What Mumtaz?Have you gone a crazy?

156
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,281
You must pick up the hint of
the customer,isn't it?

157
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,449
Why don't you try
to understand?

158
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,781
Hey!Chamdi,now don't talk too much
Send her away from here

159
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,452
Look,what has the Boss said?

160
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:14,956
Anna,I'll explain it to her...

161
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,127
Anna,please spare her
you too are...

162
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,455
You give her to me
I'll train her

163
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,293
Didn't I train,all the
other girls?

164
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:26,635
I had only trained them
isn't it?

165
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,135
Hey!Look!you come an hour early
Understood?

166
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,968
And why're you coming covering
yourself with a blanket?

167
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,472
I'll tell you how to wear it
tomorrow! Understood?

168
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,818
He's my husband Gokul
He's an Auto driver

169
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,824
I've been married for 4 years
Since then,I'm enduring him

170
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:58,163
Hey!stop it!Didn't you get
anyone else to blame?

171
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,178
Why're you stopping here?
Aren't we going home?

172
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,183
Why?

173
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,682
Today,I'm very tired

174
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:23,185
Hey!What're you talking?
I've already taken advance

175
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,689

176
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:35,698
Gokul,you know very well...That...
I'm running 2nd month pregnancy

177
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,541
You had already aborted

178
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,708
Gokul,you promised that you'll allow
me to become mother of this 4th child

179
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,383
Hey!Mother lndia,don't lecture me

180
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,712

181
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,717
Abort it tomorrow

182
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:01,056

Slut,want to become a mother

185
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:48,601
Uncle,I'll not go there to dance
I don't like anything,there

186
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:51,272
What's it you don't like?

187
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:57,110
Did you see how forcibly he
was sending Deepa?

188
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,281
He's her husband
It's their personal

189
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:02,951
What's there for us to bother
about it?

190
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,129
Look,listen to me,there's nothing
wrong to dance in Beer Bar

191
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,458
I'm there with you,isn't it?

192
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,808
Uncle,I feel very shy to
dance there?

193
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:26,138
Why feel shy?Top Heroes & Heroines
how they dance in films?

194
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:34,483
Look,it's not even 4 days in Bombay
and you've got a job,you're very lucky

195
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:42,821
If I had been lucky,we wouldn't have
to come here leaving our native place

196
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,503
Mumtazlour main duty to find
out the pulse of the customers

197
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,173
What?

198
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,673
Every type of customer
comes here

199
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,345
From a petty thief to Big Businessman...

200
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:01,006
From Automen to Black market men
Everyone comes here

201
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,851
All you've to do is,find a customer
and flatter him!Understood?

202
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,679
But,how can I recognise him?

203
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,350
Oh!My dear,not by his face
recognise him with the money he has

204
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,529
These Businessmen will
be very rich

205
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,529
Like the customer of Pushpa
what do you say,Pushpa?-Yes

206
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:21,534
Bastard,he looks like a hippopotamus
with such a large red eyes

207
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,705
You'll get scared to see him
But he has given a gold chain to me

208
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:29,034
Show him so much of style & poise
that he'll forget his wife

209
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,372
Only then,they'll shell out
money,Pimps

210
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,880
Just give a smile and
allow a little liberty-Enough

211
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:36,719
Understood?

212
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,881
But,there won't be any
trouble isn't it?

213
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,215
What's there for us to bother?

214
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,552
If someone wants to become a Romeo
let that bastard become one

215
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,887
All we want is to take money out of
him that's all,understood?

216
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,222
All we want is to fool him and
steal him,that's all

217
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:54,067
And listen carefully!Never tell your
real name to your customer

218
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,067
Tell him anything,Pinky
Ruksana,Afsana...

219
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,401
And look at me,I've given 5 different
names to 5 different customers

220
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:08,577
Come on get up...and come here

221
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,085
Come...come

222
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,260
Yes,now look at this
- But,I don't know to dance

223
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,428
Am I doing any classical dance
here for past 7 years?

224
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,932
Who knows to dance here?
Just give a few styles & poses

225
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,769
...Shake a little...a few steps forward
a few backwards

226
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:36,772
...And go round

227
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,779
And when customer sees you

228
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,951
Look straight into his eyes &
see him,Don't be afraid

229
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,954
Bottle him up,understood?

230
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:51,121
First,seek blessings!Why?

231
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,793
Because,this is our livelihood
we must respect it

232
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,964
And after that rotate like this
and scan the whole area

233
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,797
Scan?-Scan means observe everyone

234
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,975
Where's the customer sitting
with money?

235
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:10,306
And after that rotate like this
and flatter the customer

236
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,139
...Like this

237
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,642
Flatter means?-Flatter him means
looking straight into his eyes

238
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,149
Continuing the stare into his eyes

239
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:24,486
Slowly...rotating...Adjusting your
blouse in the mirror like this

240
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,162
...And flatter the customer

241
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,661
And bringing your upper cloth
in the middle like this and

242
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,834
...Turning like this...
& coming forward...

243
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,664
And going round like this
shake your hips like this

244
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:40,498
Sometimes few wastrels will also
be sitting,they'll not give any money

245
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,010
When they're sitting,just
shake slowly like this

246
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,349
Like this...like this...enough
Understood?

247
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,513
Understood?

248
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,014

How nicely Mithun has acted

I don't like this rogue,whatever she
earns she gives everything to him

314
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,230
As if that bastard is
her husband

315
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:20,241
She says he's going to start a business
- Yes,he'll start with her only

316
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,069
May be they both may marry

317
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,906
Oh!my dear,that's the problem
in our profession

318
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:29,415
The day you think of marriage

Uncle,today it was a surprise!

326
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:07,621
A man & woman came to the
Boss of Vasu Bar

327
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,950
With a 12 year old girl

328
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,291
To make her dance in
the Bar

329
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,626
They said,she's their daughter
and they were helpless

330
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:21,300
Bloody!what helplessness?
Bloody pimps

331
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,472
They may've kidnapped her
from somewhere

Hey!Film Ram Tera Ganga Maili is Running

00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,319
In such a vast city
I became alone

335
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,323
I couldn't believe myself,that
I've become a Beer Bar Dancer

336
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:51,661
Every evening life starts with
the colorful lights

00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:55,163
And it'll go on till early hours
of 2 or 3 AM

338
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,001
My earnings had made my uncle
still more useless

339
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:06,345
Leave alone trying for a job he never
bothered about finding a job

340
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:24,023
Today,I went to Brother Hedge
with Chamdi

341
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,365
He's very happy with YOU

342
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:35,536
He was praising you,Mumtaz
He was praising you very much

343
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:41,209
He was saying,Mumtaz has
started dancing very nicely

344
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,219
Did you try to find
yourself a job?

345
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:54,219
I'm trying!Everyday
I'm trying

346
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,059
Believe me

347
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,235
Are you getting memories
of our place?

348
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,904
Are you getting memories
of your parents?

349
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,579
Everything will be fine
Everything will be fine

350
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:45,605
Uncle...Uncle...

351
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,352
Enough ! stop it M umtaz

352
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,358
How much respect I had
for my uncle?

353
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,357
Don't call him as uncle
Bloody Pimp

354
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,360
If he comes here
I'll cut of his...

355
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,207
Oh!stop this cries & tears

356
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,882
Do you think you're the most
unfortunate in this world?

357
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,893
Whatever bad is happening
its happening only with you?

358
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,563
Hey!look at this Meena
She appears happy always isn't it?

359
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,725
Do you know,what she had
to go through?

360
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,897
Your poor parents died before
they got you married

361
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:54,066
Her parents married her and
sent her permanently here

362
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,413
Go...this is your In-laws place
Have a new husband everyday

363
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,581
...But send us money
regularly,that's all

364
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,578
Bloody Pimps

365
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:07,077
Look at this Farida
She's a married woman

366
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,750
She was waiting for her husband
on her first night

367
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,923
And her husband sent
a customer in

368
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,925
He took one lakh as dowry and
Rs.25,000 from customer

369
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,595
He ran away to Dubai,but this
bitch is dying a death everyday here

370
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,933
And you know about me?

371
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:30,938
My husband is my pimp

372
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,778
Every girl comes here after
getting devasted

373
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,784
Nobody likes to dance or
sleep with me

374
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:47,456
But,everyone has only one helplessness
Everyone must survive isn't it

375
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,627
These Bastards of men

376
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:57,296
Whether they wear a tie and sit in
office or having a Beer in a Bar

377
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,970
Bastards,they'll take advantage
of that helplessness

378
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:18,657
Come on get up,it's getting late
Come on what's this?Come on get up

379
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:23,327
Come

380
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,402
Oh!Brother Pothia!You?Here?

381
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:43,578
Greetings,Mr.Choksi
where are you now a days?

382
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,245
Brother Habib,was remembering you

383
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,744
Is it?Oh!I was busy with
Boiler work

384
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,080
I'm coming from there only
you were not there,or in office

385
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,257
I came up to here
searching you

386
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,421
I've a message from Brother Habib
for you

387
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,094
I want to deliver that
message to you

388
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:02,926
Hey!start the engine

389
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,436
Hey!Did you see that
yellow one?

390
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,442
Her name is Farzana

391
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,115
She's from Bachu Bhai's
brothel house

392
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,452
She used to go for Rs.200

393
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,613
Bloody Bitch,she's now
demanding Rs.1000

394
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,957
What Anna,you're standing
outside?Any trouble inside

395
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,464
No...No...How're you
Brother Pothia?

396
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:49,137
Good God!A yellow chain on
a yellow shirt

397
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,137
Shall I take it?

398
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,650
Hey!Bhola,how do I look?
Don't I look like Anil Kapoor?

399
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:57,644
Yes,Brother Pothia

400
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,822
Our boys are sitting inside isn't it?
-yes...they're sitting inside

401
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,490
Send a Bundle of Rs.10 inside

402
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,489
Brother Pothia,the thing is that
now a days Business is very dull

403
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,823
What's it man?What's it?

404
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,826
It's a drama you play everyday
send the money inside,that's all

405
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:14,502
Come Suresh,let's go in

406
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,836
What does he think of himself?
Where can I get the money from?

407
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,520
Hey!How're you boy?-I'm fine

408
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,026
Isn't it firm?

409
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,192
Fine! Fantastic

410
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:49,697
Hey!where's our Pawar?

411
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,031
Brother,as soon as he drinks
2 bottles

412
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,866
He'll urinate like a buffalo

413
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:55,702
Look,he's here

414
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,206
How're you?

415
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,215
Sit down...sit down
-hey!Brave man!Keep!

416
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:09,050
Hey!What's this Pawar?
Doesn't water stay in your body?

417
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,222
What're you saying
Brother Pothia?

418
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,887
What's this,you too are
making fun of me?

419
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,228
Hey!Bloody,if not you,who else
Am I going to make fun of?

420
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,578
Where did all of them go off?

421
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:35,415
Like old smelly food
all stinking tired faces

422
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,251
Brother Pothia,your item
is inside

423
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:51,261
I get your memories very often
No,I miss you very much

424
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,426
What will you bring from Jaipur?

425
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,943
Bloody cheapster

426
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,270
Farida is he coming?

427
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,439
He'll come definitely bloody!That donkey
has fallen in love with me

428
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,615
My dear,my Kimi Katkar

429
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,622
Oh!my Anil Kapoor
Have you come back?

430
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:23,127
Oh!My dear Farida
How're you?

431
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,464
How's your Arab Lover
from Bahrain?

432
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,128
Have you robbed him or not?

433
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:29,798
Did you squeeze him or not?

434
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,970
What to do,Pothia,you don't seem
to show any interest in me?

435
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,973
Hey!you've become cold,my girl

436
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,648
You don't have that spark in you any more?
What do you say Shabboo?

437
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,152
You're looking great!come

438
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:51,322
Oh!Who's this?-New product

439
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:52,992
Come on man

440
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:07,170
Whatever you may be,there's
a fragrance in your body

441
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,502
I like that very much

442
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,841
Here...there...

443
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:19,176
Bloody Bitch,you like only
one fragrance

444
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,181
This one...isn't it?

445
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:25,357
Take it...Take it...Take it

446
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,690
Bloody!Do I sleep with you
for this?

447
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:33,367
Take more...take more

448
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,714
Pushpa,come let's get the
thread from the Saint

449
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:01,726
What happened to you?

450
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:09,063
Nothing?-What nothing?

451
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,564
Come on tell,Mumtaz

452
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,078
I don't want to stay in that
place any more

453
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:25,580
I hate to see my uncle's face

454
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:26,921
Why?

455
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:33,087
Did he do anything?-No

456
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,259
You find me another place
to live that's all

457
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:44,762
Will you stay alone?

458
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:53,771
Do you think,that only your uncle
is a bastard in this world?

459
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,449
If you stay alone,will anyone
spare you?

460
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,781
This is man's time!As soon as he
comes to know,you're alone...

461
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,454
They'll tear you apart
like Vultures

462
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,458
This is Bombay

463
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,136
Then,what am I to do?

464
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:27,309
You take me to your house
- With me?

465
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,312
What do you think?ls my
husband an incarnation of God?

466
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:40,317
Will he spare you?
Right...in front of my eyes,he'll...

467
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,163
Make yourself strong

468
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:56,177
There's no one here,who can
support you

469
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,181
You're the support
for yourself

470
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,518
Bloody!What's his Bar?
- Yes that Bar

471
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,350
Who's she to you?

472
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:18,366
He told her,he'll make her
a Zeenat Aman

473
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,865
He was roaming with her
for 5 months

474
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,541
Bloody,he didn't even take her
to a Zeenat Aman's film also?

475
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,047
Why're you getting tensed up?You start
preparations for your elections

476
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,879
Greetings!-Greetings

477
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,710
What Pothia?Congratulations!

478
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:40,217
Sit...sit...

479
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,557
Pothia,now a days you're being
discussed everywhere

480
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,893
You settled that Choksi's
matter superbly

481
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,071
Now,these bloody Builder's
lobby will cool down

482
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:57,905
They'll be afraid of Boys

483
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:00,237
I got a phone call from
across seas also

484
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,910
Everyone's happy!you were praised

485
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,081
You've started settling very
big things

486
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:09,576
Good,very good

487
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,581
Its good,but there's a complaint
also against you

488
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,251
Did you threaten Manager of
Caezar's palace recently?

489
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,594
You broke the glass pane of
Mahim Anna's Hotel?

490
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,599
You collected money from people

491
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,761
Pothia,leave these petty things
Think something big,really big

492
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,103
Understood?

493
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:34,434
What's this silly Rowdyism?

494
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,777
Oh!Uma,you too go on harp the
same like an old record

495
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,278
Leave it buddy
Let's talk some business

496
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:41,946
What Brother Habib?

497
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,783
I've heard that the men of Ganeshwadi
& Behrambagh are dead

498
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,948
They were acting too smart

499
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,617
Sometime back,they both were
working for me

500
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,122
Now,they were going against me

501
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:59,464
I stage managed an encounter with
sir & Gaikvvad & killed them

502
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,464
Listen,now both these areas
are into our Kitty

503
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,965
And you've to look after
both these areas

504
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,309
You've to look after those areas

505
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:13,303
But,with a cool mind
- Yes

506
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,811
With cleverness-yes brother

507
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:19,317
Because,it's Uma's constituency
He's going to become a corporator

508

It's daily affair for us!

579
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,766
Anna might not've paid the
bribe on time...that's all

580
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,073
I've never been to a
Police station before

581
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,044

I'll go sir!

604
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,249
Pushpa,you're coming
with us,isn't it?

605
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:16,883
No...no,Azhar has come Isn't it?

606
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,279
Okay! enjoy!

607
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:39,772
This Shabboo will never
get reformed!

608
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:45,878
She's always at it
- That too with a black moustacheod man

609
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,844
Today another incident became
a part of my life!

610
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,210
In my native,if a police
comes to any house

611
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,054
People used look down on them!

612
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,059
And today,I had to go to
a police station myself

613
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:04,525
But,with Deepa's help,I was trying
to learn to overcome my weaknesses

614
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,395
Today,I was really scared!

615
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,293
But,I controlled my tears
from rolling down

616
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,632
Everyday my life began
from that tenement

617
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:20,044
I hated to see uncle's
face also

618
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,515
I was waiting for the
evening to come!

619
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,818
So,that I could go to
the bar

620
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,448
I started feeling oneness there!

621
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:33,118
Deepa's confidence
Rani's Laughter

622
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:34,551
Shabboo's choicest abuses

623
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,795
All these were much better than the
disgusting face of my uncle

624
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:45,806
Pasha's antics filled our sorrowful
lives with laughter & happiness

625
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:13,000
Hey! Vasco! Having a great fun?

626
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,294
Manish,get me introduced to her!

627
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:16,628
Shall I call?

628
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,396
Bet?- Yes!

629
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:20,605
Now watch the fun!

630
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:46,564
He's my friend Manish
one minute

631
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:54,538
Listen,this scapegoat
is a Richman's son

632
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:55,834
What if?

633
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,272
Nothing,we've a bet!

634
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,878
Put your ring into my finger
in front of him!

635
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,275
Then watch out,how he'll
shell out money?

636
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:08,212
Is it? Then,I'll do it!

637
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:08,980
Excellent

638
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:13,858
Great! fun

639
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,975
Manish,how do you feel today?

640
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,618
Vasco,today I had real fun

641
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:51,622
Had great fun Isn't it?
Then,let's have another round

642
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,620
Take it! & go!

643
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:56,628
How're you feeling now?

644
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,058
I'm fine! How's the Bar
doing,Anju?

645
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:02,998
I'm really lucky today
That Vasco has brought a new pigeon

646
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:03,431
Is it?

647
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,673
Tell me,about your story!
- Everything's really cold!

648
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:07,967
All wastrels are sitting
Bloody all're lazy & tired fools

649
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:12,675
Heard that Mumtaz's customer
has garlanded her with notes

650
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:16,614
Hey Mumtaz rob...rob him
Today it's your day

651
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,980
No,I think he has visited 2 or 3
Beer Bars before coming here

652
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,515
Bloody he's a rascal

653
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,357
He“ Have you picked up
mY lauguage?

654
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:32,124
Yes sir!

655
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,629
Gaikvvad has asked to send
Pushpa to Hotel Yathri!

656
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,567
Yes sir!- send her quickly
- I'll inform sir!

657
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:39,000
Move!

658
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:47,848
Anna,Gaikvvard has called
Pushpa now!

659
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:52,144
Hey! Pushpa,Gaikvvad has
sent for you,go!

660
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,055
Your Vasco had given this
Rs 100 for you

661
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,763
Went away? where did be go away?
- How do I know it?

662
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:09,159
He gave it in the Bar
and went away

663
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,134
Pimp!

664
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:14,136
He had my ring with him
did he return it?

665
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,037
He gave Rs 100 to me and told to
give it to you that's all

666
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,906
Bloody Bastard he ran away
with my ring!

667
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,146
He told,he'll sell out
Rs 1000 for me

668
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,639
Such rogues come in plenty under
the guise of customers

669
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,820
This is what had happened to
Farzana in Bismi Bar

670
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,146
He ran away with her chain

671
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,318
Bloody Bastard I'll not
spare him

672
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:30,957
Pasha,go & see if he's there!

673
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,915
Will he come back?

674
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,354
The bloody man has cheated you!

675
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:46,204
Look,Mumtaz this is Bombay's Band stand!
Where we're sitting now!

676
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,509
Film'Shakthi' was shot here only

677
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:55,815
Dilip kumar & Amitabh stood here &
were delivering lectures to each other!

678
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:59,953
Hey! Matinee show,shut up!

679
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,519
Come Friday and you can see
her outside a Theatre...

680
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,789
Mumtaz did you see any
film or not?

681
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,388
I had once seen a film

682
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:08,425
Which one?

683
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,490
With glasses!

684
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:10,720
With glasses-Which one?!

685
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:17,067
It's not Chetan Chowhan,say
it as"Chota Chetan"

686
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:22,175
What a great film it was!
What a magical film it was

687
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,867
Scenes came straight on
to our faces!

688
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:28,181
I had seen that film twice!

689
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,578
And both times I came back
with those glasses

690
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,846
How do you find Bombay's
sight seeing?

691
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:39,788
I feel very happy!
No worries,no troubles

692
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,924
This is the only happiness
in our life!

693
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,658
As evening approaches,again
the same old bloody Beer Bar

694
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:52,029
Same smoke,same customers
same artificial dances

695
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,071
And the same bloody artificial laughs

696
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,602
It's a daily routine!

697
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,978
Sit down...Sit down!

698
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,529
Hey! Get away from here
Get away from here

699
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,636
Pothia & his boys always
play this drama

700
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,797
Even in that Mahim Bar they used
to create trouble like this only

701
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,260
What's this Pothia,you're acting
too much today?

702
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:43,419
Will you sleep with me?

703
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,510
Bloody,who's her pimp?

704
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:05,851
What're you talking?
Give some respect to him!

705
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,419
Respect him! Are you refusing
brother Pothia?

706
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:09,655
You're putting our lives in danger!

707
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,483
I know to look after myself!

708
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:16,220
Hey! you don't know about Pothia
He has killed many big shots

709
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:16,953
What're you for him?

710
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,655
If he really goes crazy
not only in Chandni Bar!

711
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,765
...You can't be able work in
any Bar in Bombay

712
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,396
I don't want to do such work
- Don't you want to do?

713
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,071
Then,how will the hunger subside?

714
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:28,006
I'm a man,I can survive
some how

715
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,803
You don't know if you refuse him

716
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,638
How many people's desires
you've to satisfy?

717
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:33,973
What do you say Uncle?
- Then what?

718
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:37,106
Yes if there're uncle's like you
it'll happen like this only

719
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,248
Hey! Don't be adament!

720
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:41,247
Don't irritate me!

721
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,749
I've promised Pothia that I'll explain
you & bring you to him

722
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,588
You come with me at once!

723
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,095
Hey! Uncle make her understand

724
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,265
Hey! Go Mumtaz go...
I'm telling you to go

725
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:54,434
It's good for everyone,I'm not
some one else,I'm your uncle

726
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:05,274
Where should I go?

727
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:29,021
Bloody,she's cold like a stone!

728
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,699
She has ruined my mood!

729
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,199
She has watered down entire
bottles intoxication

730
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:46,705
Shall I go?

731
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:50,709
Shall I go? No,sit here only
I'll ward off evil eyes casted on you

732
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,714
It cost me a lot for nothing!

733
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,056
Why're you still sitting here?
Get lost!

734
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:09,903
Hey! Stop!

735
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:17,237
Take this - take this
money & go!

736
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:25,744
Come here!

737
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:27,920
Come here!

738
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:34,753
Take this & go,I don't want
anything free!

739
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:35,257
Go!

740
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,603
Why? Is it not enough?

741
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:50,436
Take some more!

742
01:12:56,638 --> 01:13:00,279
Sit...Sit down!

743
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,456
Why're you so proud?

744
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:16,466
Look,I've started loving you
that's why,I'm after you

745
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,138
Are you afraid of me!

746
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:25,470
Is it?

747
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,648
You don't seem to be
from Bombay!

748
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:34,813
You aren't..

749
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:40,993
Where've you come from?

750
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,326
Your parents are there?

751
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:50,496
They died in the riots

752
01:13:58,367 --> 01:13:59,505
Tell me one thing?

753
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:05,014
Who brought you in this bar?

754
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:07,846
Maternal Uncle..

755
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:14,353
You haven't had sex
before with anybody?

756
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:24,363
What?What did I ask you?

757
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:31,536
Hey! you!

758
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:44,216
Why are you crying?

759
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:01,908
Hello Bhusey Brother
come..come..

760
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:03,569
Come, haPPY!

761
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:09,245
What happened Bhusey Brother?

762
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:41,774
You want to go back
to your place?

763
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:44,780
Or will you marry me?

764
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:12,972
Friends have turned the room
into a garden

765
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,486
Have you been seeing
lots of Hindi films?

766
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,991
Hey,you!

767
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:30,155
Sit here

768
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,829
Are you angry,Is it?

769
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,000
Hey,my milk is this
look...

770
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:45,508
You also take a little
You'll be very excited

771
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,008
I also started with a
small quantity

772
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,014
Now a bottle is also
insufficient

773
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:57,516
Come on drink it!
take it!

774
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:03,196
What's it,What're you
looking at it?

775
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:07,867
Come, come here

776
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:13,865
Who is bothering me here?

777
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:15,208
Who's it?

778
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:16,876
Oh,my charming boy!

779
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:20,209
Abuse him..abuse me..

780
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:23,212
Rascal,you've forgotten me!

781
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:27,376
Hey,you interfering bitch
- You bloody dog

782
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,886
You skunk,got married!

783
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:32,558
Yes,I fancied her

784
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,886
She's only my woman

785
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,059
Unlike you,who has many
customers

786
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,563
Hey,you don't have that charm
bitch

787
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:44,063
You skunk, now,what'll
happen to me?

788
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,233
Let me celebrate the nuptial
night with her

789
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,410
I'll celebrate nuptial
day tomorrow

790
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:54,402
Now shut up and sleep

791
01:17:58,106 --> 01:17:59,744
Why're you getting worked up?

792
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,748
Look,I'm like this only

793
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,590
I've given you the
license,isn't it?

794
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:09,928
Come this side

795
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:14,426
Bloody bastards,their mothers...

796
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,261
What happened Farida?
- What else?

797
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:20,429
All're beggars,I don't know where
do they come from?

798
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:22,107
You've no regrets

799
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,106
Last week you got 1000 Rs.

800
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:25,937
That fellow from Andheri
gave you

801
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:27,609
And after that,nothing

802
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:31,444
So what?you also entice some
boy like Mumtaz

803
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:34,779
Mumtaz is a lucky bitch

804
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:37,286
That bugger married her

805
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,956
And look at Pushpa

806
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:43,789
She was giving her entire earning
to that beggar Azhar

807
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:48,456
Thinking that,that crook will
marry her,produce children

808
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,303
But what did he do?

809
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:52,972
With her money,he started
another business

810
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,641
And married some
other girl

811
01:18:55,831 --> 01:19:00,143
Saying that beer bar girls are
meant only for enjoyment

812
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:03,145
Not for marriage
bloody pimp

813
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,816
All are not as lucky
as Mumtaz

814
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:12,989
See who has come?
- You'll live for 100 years

815
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:14,489
Just now we were talking
about you only

816
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,488
Mumtaz,how are you?

817
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:21,327
Tell us,how did it go?
how is your boy?

818
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,829
He must be fantastic,that's why
she's shining

819
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:30,665
Deepa,hey,Mumtaz,how
are you?

820
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:37,010
That Santacruz bugger of yours
told Ranjana,I love you

821
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:39,177
What's happening here?

822
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:47,020
Deepa, Rani,come quickly
on the floor...

823
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,029
Mumtaz sit

824
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,361
Yes Mumtaz,tell me

825
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:58,036
How are you,brother?

826
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:01,867
Nothing new,same bar
same business..

827
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:04,369
Tell me,how is the bugger?

828
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:05,708
He's fine

829
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,876
Everyone remembers you here

830
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:10,375
Your old customers are daily
enquiring about you

831
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:14,046
Tell me,When'll you come
back here?

832
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,387
Brother,I've nothing to do
here any more

833
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:21,887
Meaning?

834
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,226
I'm married,brother

835
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:25,891
Now,I'll start a family

836
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:28,893
I'm not coming here

837
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:32,567
As you like

838
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:34,406
Shall I tell you one thing?

839
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:38,574
This bugger of yours is a pimp

840
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,743
Such people can't be trusted

841
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:42,745
They're not permanent
hookers

842
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:46,078
Even then,if you need anything
come here

843
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,584
Come to brother,don't have
second thoughts

844
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:50,586
Okay brother!

845
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:58,261
Hey,Suresh,how are you?

846
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,769
You don't worry

847
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:10,435
I'll make a move
- Take care of yourself

848
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,778
I was also leaving this
bar forever

849
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:27,954
On one hand I was sorry to leave
Deepa,Farida Rani,Pushpa

850
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:31,790
And on the other hand,I was happy
to find a new life

851
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:34,626
I was happy

852
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:39,635
That,I wouldn't have to dance
in this beer bar again

853
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:46,301
I never expected so much
happiness in my life

854
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:50,472
Pothia had become father,we
named the child Abhay

855
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:54,817
Seeing Pothia happy
I too was happy

856
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,653
And Pothia's business
also flourished

857
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:00,159
And the danger was
also increasing

858
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,990
Pothya's friends were
his weakness

859
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,830
To give them drinks
food & money...

860
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,662
...Had become his habit

861
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,336
But,when he became stubborn..

862
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:16,668
He wouldn't listen to anyone

863
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,838
Everybody was vexed by
his adamancy

864
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:24,347
When Pothia didn't return
till late in the nights

865
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:26,686
I used to have nightmares

866
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,518
Then I used to lean
on Abhay

867
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,354
I had only one wish

868
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:35,354
That I should bring up
Abhay very nicely

869
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:38,698
Educate him & make him
a decent person

870
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,363
2 years passed

871
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,528
I was again pregnant

872
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:56,374
Habib Brother,look at Abhay

873
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:57,709
Hey,Abhay!

874
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:01,217
Habib Brother,he's our
junior Pothia

875
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:07,383
He's absolutely perfect
take this...

876
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,057
He'll be smarter than Pothia
when he grows up

877
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,900
Even now,he's very smart

878
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:19,402
As soon as goes in the
lap of Pawar,he urinates

879
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:23,736
Good,take these Rs.501/-
from Umar Uncle

880
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:28,736
Pawar has been shot
by the Police

881
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:31,084
What? -Mania informer
tipped the Police

882
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:37,587
You be calm,don't be rash..

883
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:41,419
Mumtaz make him understand
Pothia listen to me...

884
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:46,092
When Pothia was enraged
he shunned discretion

885
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:48,764
And the inevitable happened

886
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:52,434
In spite of being restrained
by Habib Brother & Uma Shankar

887
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,774
And the danger from
the Police looming

888
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,939
He didn't bother and...

889
01:23:57,799 --> 01:23:59,278
...He killed informer Munia

890
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,609
He didn't come home
for some days

891
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:13,452
I..l had decided that my children
will not go Pothia's way

892
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:39,314
Where's your husband?

893
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,992
You're Mumtaz,who dances
in beer bar?

894
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,333
Bhosle,search the house

895
01:24:55,523 --> 01:24:57,662
See if you find anything
search every nook & corner

896
01:24:57,859 --> 01:24:58,667
Yes sir

897
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,670
Where's your husband
speak up?

898
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,169
He hasn't come home for
the last 2 days

899
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:08,343
He must be laying some girl
bloody pimp

900
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,851
He holds party's here &
kills people outside

901
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:18,356
But what happened,sir?

902
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:19,350
Look here,Sir!

903
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,189
Sir,this sword is found

904
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:25,364
This gun was found inside!

905
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:30,865
Now your husband will meet
his Waterloo

906
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:34,373
He has pulled the trigger
many times

907
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,870
Now watch,Police will pull him up
you watch

908
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:40,712
Sir,wireless message has come

909
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:42,381
He has been caught in
Teli street

910
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:49,547
Take this,put it on

911
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,218
Get ready to become a widow
understand!

912
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:55,227
Let's go

913
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:02,394
You consider Police as your
friend,dogs

914
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:04,570
You're killing Police
informers

915
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:05,897
How're you feeling?
how are you feeling?

916
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:19,074
Finding it cold
take it...

917
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:26,084
You'll kill Police informer
and enjoy outside,take it

918
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:33,425
Bastards,why are you
people born?

919
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,631
You're killing Police informers

920
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:16,302
Beat them mercilessly,break
their bone,don't spare them

921
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:17,805
I'll beat them nicely,sir

922
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,976
Hey,don't stop,losen him up

923
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:38,997
Who's it?

924
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:41,834
What's it?

925
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:43,995
Mumtaz has come to meet you

926
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:49,674
So late in the night...?

927
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:54,012
That's... -What happened?

928
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:58,506
Pothia has been taken
by the Police

929
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,511
I knew it!

930
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:02,855
Why worry about it?

931
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:05,020
It's a common feature in
our business

932
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:09,025
I've pulled some strings,he'll be
bailed out in 2-3 days,go home

933
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:11,697
But,When'll he come home?

934
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,197
I told you,he'll be bailed out
I'm there

935
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:16,364
You go home

936
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:20,695
If there's any problem

937
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:22,875
Okay,Okay!

Come..come..careful...

01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:09,588
What happened?

940
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:14,749
Tell me,what happened?
- Tell what happened?

941
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:18,260
Pothia...Police has taken

942
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:21,259
Pothia has been taken away by the
Police,When? -When

943
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:26,264
Tell us Mumo,tell us

944
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,600
I had gone to Habib Brother

945
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:33,768
What did he say?
what did he say...?

946
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:38,610
I'll tell you..what'll I do!

947
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:43,778
Tell us,don't be upset
we're there

948
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:47,782
Nothing will happen to him,Police
has taken him for questioning..

949
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,131
She is having pain

950
01:29:56,324 --> 01:30:04,300
Call the Doctor,phone to Doctor
quickly,don't worry

951
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:17,650
Hey!how pretty she is?..choti..

952
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:18,986
Look!

953
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,490
Pothia has been bailed out

954
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:25,831
Baby has brought very
good news,see..

955
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:30,669
Now you don't worry
Pothia will come home soon

956
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:33,168
What're you talking?
he's being released tomorrow

957
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:46,351
Hey,Mumtaz!

958
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:48,521
She laughs just like you

959
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:51,520
And he's absolutely stubborn
like you

960
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:54,018
After entire morning's effort
now he's drinking milk

961
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:56,862
And he'll be like me
very brave

962
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:01,192
I don't want him
to be a rowdy

963
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:05,860
I'll educate him & make him a big man
- Big man..big man..

964
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,539
Am I not a big man?

965
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:15,206
What're we going
to name her?

966
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:18,046
She laughs absolutely like you
Chan..Chan..Chan..

967
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:21,053
Payal,we'll name her Payal

968
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,389
All said & done Mr.Gaikvvad

969
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:29,223
Pothia is my man

970
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:33,399
By bailing out Pothia,you
haven't done a good deed

971
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:36,902
He'll not shed his
stubbornness

972
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:41,406
Killing the informer is like
killing the Police

973
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:44,568
Police is cheesed of him

974
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,909
Because Pothia belongs
to your gang

975
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:52,910
High level meeting of
the Police is going on

976
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,418
I don't know,how many of your people
will be sent behind bars

977
01:31:56,611 --> 01:32:03,756
Uma Brother is linked with you
by the Police

978
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:08,267
The threat can threaten you
Habib Brother

979
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:12,267
A warrant can also be
issued against you

980
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:19,771
All of you go out

981
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:30,785
Alright Gaikvvad Sir

982
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:39,295
Send 2,3 to jail,kill 2,3
in encounter

983
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:43,795
Uma,we'll give him
2,3 of our boys

984
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:46,639
Let the pimps be behind
bars for a few days

985
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:48,140
Okay!

986
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:50,802
No Bhai...But!

987
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:06,985
See there,how is it
going there?

988
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:10,325
See,Mother has come
Mother...

989
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:15,327
Mother,I'm very hungry
why're you so late

990
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:21,502
I forgot to tell you

991
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:25,511
My old girl Shabboo
she met me..

992
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:32,017
Don't be tensed up,darling

993
01:33:32,206 --> 01:33:33,844
She has got married

994
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,355
She married the new barber
of Bandra

995
01:33:36,544 --> 01:33:38,683
Got married to him

Was there any trouble

01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:52,696

Come..come...

1003
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:10,054
What happened Sheikh Sir?

1004
01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:12,888
Hey nothing,Some non-entities
created some problem in Behram Pada

1005
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,559
Officers instructed to conduct
routine enquiry

01:34:14,749 --> 01:34:16,057
That's why,everyone is

You'll be back in 1 hour..

1008
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:31,068
Hey Gaikvvad Sir,why're you
creating trouble?

Hey,you mongoose,get up,go away

1013
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:13,785
Do your parents know?

1014
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:21,626
Sheikh
- Yes sir!

1015
01:35:22,483 --> 01:35:23,291

This is not right...

1019
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,158
Gaikvvad Sir,this is not right

1020
01:35:54,014 --> 01:35:55,322
Run,you buggers...run..

1021
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:42,173
You say it
- Why should we bother?

1022
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:45,202
How much time will it take
to get the bodies?

1023
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:48,714
You don't know,many bodies
have come

1024
01:36:48,903 --> 01:36:50,541
People are waiting outside

1025
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:53,548

Please hurry up
- Wait outside,go..

1027
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:03,554
What do you've to say
for those 3 persons?

1028
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:06,561
Those 3 were not innocent
they were criminals

1029
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:09,735
But we've heard that the encounter
was planned,part of gang war

1030
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:13,231
Your Police department people were
friends of the underworld

1031
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:18,900
Look,we've already suspended Inspector
Gaikvvad & Inspector Sheikh

1032
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:21,238
Enquiry has been instituted
against both of them

1033
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:23,745
Then,are you accepting your
responsibility-Look

1034
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:27,579
Before accusing we..
Police people

1035
01:37:28,275 --> 01:37:30,585
You understand your
responsibility

1036
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:33,250
In tomorrow's News papers
you people..

1037
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,927
Are definitely going tear
Police people apart

1038
01:37:36,283 --> 01:37:37,591
But about those 3

1039
01:37:38,118 --> 01:37:40,928
You won't write anything about
their criminal records

1040
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:43,598
Let's go,Bhosle

1041
01:38:13,821 --> 01:38:16,631
What'll I do now?

1042
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:25,970
What'll I do now?

1043
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:42,160
Hey,women,don't crowd here

1044
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:43,487
Hey,take out the body

1045
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:45,162
You people go HWQY

1046
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:08,679
Whatever had to happen
has happened,Mumtaz

1047
01:39:12,713 --> 01:39:14,522
You've 2 small kids

1048
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:19,695
For their future,You'll
have to think

1049
01:39:21,722 --> 01:39:25,033
Whenever you need me
let me know

1050
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:29,707
I'm with you,Mumtaz

1051
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:38,713
If you need any money
then...

1052
01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:43,550
Some money is there
at home

1053
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:51,055
Pothia had loaned some money
to his friends

1054
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:55,067
If I get them back
I'll start something

1055
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:14,411
No child..no..

1056
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:17,918
What're you doing here?

1057
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:23,751
Get out..get out..
get up..get out..

1058
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:25,422
Uma Brother,she...

1059
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:27,591
Go out..go...

1060
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:39,443
Wagle,1 minute

1061
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,938
Yes,tell me Mumtaz

1062
01:40:42,636 --> 01:40:43,614
Uma Brother,that...

1063
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:47,615
Say quickly,I don't have
the whole day

1064
01:40:49,977 --> 01:40:54,790
Uma Brother,I was thinking of
starting some work

1065
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:56,953
Now Pothia is also
not there

1066
01:40:57,484 --> 01:41:01,455
I was thinking of running 2,3
Autorikshaws...

1067
01:41:01,655 --> 01:41:02,963
With their hire,I can
meet my expenses

1068
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:04,135
Then,what should I do?

1069
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:08,135
I need money,Uma Brother

1070
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:11,309
Money, to you..
on what guarantee?

1071
01:41:11,832 --> 01:41:12,469
Suppose,you run away
With it..

1072
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:18,472
I don't want loan,Pothia had
loaned some money to you,that..

1073
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:20,644
Have you gone mad?

1074
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:23,146
A riff raff like Pothia

1075
01:41:23,343 --> 01:41:25,323
Will give a loan to a person
like Uma Shankar

1076
01:41:26,013 --> 01:41:28,493
But Pothia had told me that
Uma Brother,that...

1077
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:29,990
That bugger had told
you a lie

1078
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:34,662
On the contrary,he has
put me to loss

1079
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:36,500
And because of that

1080
01:41:36,857 --> 01:41:38,666
My name has been linked
with the underworld

1081
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:41,168
He has put all of
us in trouble

1082
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:45,343
Tell me one more thing
Mumtaz?

1083
01:41:45,699 --> 01:41:47,508
Even,if Pothia had given
me money

1084
01:41:47,868 --> 01:41:49,006
Then,why should I give you?

1085
01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:54,515
I'm his widow,Uma Brother!

1086
01:41:56,376 --> 01:41:56,854
Widow!

1087
01:41:57,544 --> 01:42:01,856
After the death of a Husband,a wife
becomes widow..not a Concubine

1088
01:42:02,716 --> 01:42:05,356
You were not the wife of Pothia
But a Concubine

1089
01:42:05,719 --> 01:42:08,359
And Pothia had so many
Concubines in Bombay

1090
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:11,366
If all of them come &
stand there

1091
01:42:11,725 --> 01:42:13,705
Then,I would be giving alms
to all of them

1092
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:16,200
Now,you go from here

1093
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:18,209
Don't ever come here again

1094
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:21,205
I am a M.L.A,not your pimp

1095
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:24,541
If beer bar girls like you
come here

1096
01:42:24,738 --> 01:42:26,376
Then, I'll get a bad name

1097
01:42:26,573 --> 01:42:31,545
Understood,go..
I told you to go,isn't it?

1098
01:42:33,914 --> 01:42:35,393
Don't ever come here,go

1099
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:38,063
Yes wagle,what happened
to that?

1100
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:39,890
You got it transferred
- It's done,sir

1101
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:43,557
Have you finished
Raj Brother's work?

1102
01:42:43,757 --> 01:42:45,065
That'll be done by
evening,Sir

1103
01:43:16,290 --> 01:43:18,270
In business,profit &
loss happens.

1104
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:21,439
But don't bother about the job of
your son-in-law,Mr.Maqbool

1105
01:43:21,628 --> 01:43:24,609
I've talked to BMC commissioner
your work will be done

1106
01:43:29,136 --> 01:43:29,944
Mumtaz has come

1107
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,620
Okay,I'll make a move
- Okay come..

1108
01:43:40,814 --> 01:43:42,122
Greetings
- Greetings

1109
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:43,954
Haji Brother,she's our Mumtaz
- I see..

1110
01:43:44,151 --> 01:43:45,789
She's Pothia widow

1111
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:47,294
Sit Mumtaz sit,I'll come..

1112
01:43:49,156 --> 01:43:55,471
Bye..Bye!Come..Look after
yourself

1113
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:07,649
I'm in trouble
Habib Brother

1114
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:10,981
I can understand

1115
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:13,325
After Pothia has gone...

1116
01:44:14,348 --> 01:44:18,819
Yes sir!I had also gone
to Uma Shankar

1117
01:44:20,187 --> 01:44:22,667
He insulted me a lot

1118
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:25,332
He was talking nonsense

1119
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:29,667
Where should I go Habib Brother
What should I do?

1120
01:44:31,698 --> 01:44:33,507
Pothia respected you a lot

1121
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:37,845
If these children weren't there
I would've died

1122
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:41,349
But I've to bring them up

1123
01:44:44,044 --> 01:44:47,355
I,the alone woman,where
can I go,Habib Brother?

1124
01:44:49,549 --> 01:44:52,689
Now,thinking you to be my own
I came

1125
01:44:54,221 --> 01:44:55,199
I am depending only on you

1126
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:00,037
Don't worry,Mumtaz

1127
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:03,541
I'll make arrangements
for you

1128
01:45:03,897 --> 01:45:04,875
I don't need much money
Habib Brother

1129
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:10,371
Look Mumtaz,I can give you money
right now

1130
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:11,878
There's no problem
about money

1131
01:45:12,572 --> 01:45:14,381
But,if I give you today
It'll finish tomorrow

1132
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:16,053
You'll again come to ask

1133
01:45:16,410 --> 01:45:18,390
Like this,you'll get habituated
of asking

1134
01:45:19,913 --> 01:45:21,722
I'll get you a job

1135
01:45:22,249 --> 01:45:23,728
You do one thing
go to Dubai

1136
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:28,900
What'll I do in Dubai?

1137
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:31,227
You'll earn money
what else?

1138
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:36,067
Look Mumtaz,this is your age
to earn money

1139
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:39,236
There our Sheikh's will introduce
you to proper people

1140
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:40,070
Isn't it Madan?

1141
01:45:42,602 --> 01:45:43,410
Stay there for 5-7 years
then,come back

1142
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:50,751
By then,you'll earn so much money
that your life'll be secured

1143
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:55,086
These Arabians have a lot of cash
understood

1144
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:01,598
What?Habib Brother!

1145
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:09,771
Have you left rowdyism
& started pimping?

1146
01:46:13,133 --> 01:46:13,941
What did you say?

1147
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:17,111
What did you say?

1148
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:22,779
You called me a pimp?

1149
01:46:23,643 --> 01:46:25,452
You wicked woman,bitch!

1150
01:46:27,714 --> 01:46:28,454
Get out from here

1151
01:46:29,816 --> 01:46:32,797
You bitch,because of Pothia
I was helping you & you!

1152
01:46:33,487 --> 01:46:37,799
She calls Habib Brother a pimp
this cheap beer bar girl

1153
01:46:38,992 --> 01:46:40,801
Why did you produce
2 children?

1154
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:43,636
If you had that much pride,you
could become the Concubine of a rich man

1155
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:45,639
You call me a pimp
you bitch

1156
01:46:45,832 --> 01:46:47,971
I'll get acid thrown on your face
get out from here

1157
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:54,309
In my area,she calls
me pimp?

1158
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:00,817
Take a bowl in the hand
& beg

1159
01:47:02,182 --> 01:47:05,163
Don't show me your face again
I'll break your legs

1160
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,161
Calling Habib Brother
a pump?

1161
01:47:21,201 --> 01:47:24,011
Okay,we'll go
to mummy

1162
01:47:30,777 --> 01:47:34,020
Quiet baby quiet,see how mummy
is dancing,how beautiful...

1163
01:48:04,578 --> 01:48:05,556
Quiet quiet,quiet

1164
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:08,389
Deepa
- Yes

1165
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:09,555
Your customer has come

1166
01:48:09,749 --> 01:48:11,057
Oh!this customer had to come
at this time only

1167
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:12,889
Come come
-quiet quiet...

1168
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:14,231
Ohlstop crying...Stop...

1169
01:48:42,115 --> 01:48:46,257
Oh!oh!payal baby,what happened
Why are you crying?...

1170
01:48:56,296 --> 01:48:59,106
Darling mummy is working,you're
hungry?...do you want milk?

1171
01:49:09,976 --> 01:49:12,456
I'll send your mummy
don't cry

1172
01:50:35,562 --> 01:50:38,873
A never ending problem of my
helplessness had started

1173
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:42,380
The beer bar that I had
abandoned

1174
01:50:43,336 --> 01:50:44,542
Became my support

1175
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,719
By engulfing my ambitions
at the beer bar

1176
01:50:49,576 --> 01:50:52,056
I started fulfilling the
needs of my children

1177
01:50:53,747 --> 01:50:58,389
lnspite of the noise all around me
there was a vaccum in my life

1178
01:51:00,754 --> 01:51:03,064
Deepa was fed of
her man

1179
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:07,071
He would come drunk late
in the night & assaut her

1180
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:10,741
And on one night,in his
drunkardness

1181
01:51:12,098 --> 01:51:12,735
Gokul killed Deepa

1182
01:51:14,601 --> 01:51:16,911
Her ambition of becoming a mother
ended in her death

1183
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:21,076
Deepa's absence was
pinching me

1184
01:51:22,108 --> 01:51:23,815
But I had lost so
much,that-

1185
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:25,749
I was not grieved

1186
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,987
Dancing daily in the
beer bar

1187
01:51:29,783 --> 01:51:31,421
Had become a part of
my life

1188
01:51:56,142 --> 01:51:57,280
I had forbidden you
Isn't it?

1189
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:00,457
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

1190
01:52:03,817 --> 01:52:05,353
You'll also go in the
bar to dance like me

1191
01:52:10,323 --> 01:52:12,633
Why am I sending you to school
to educate you?

1192
01:52:30,009 --> 01:52:33,479
This is not goog child
this dancing & singing

1193
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:41,988
I am educating you to make you
come up good in life

1194
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:45,999
So that,I don't have to do
all this...come

1195
01:52:56,536 --> 01:52:57,947
Come,let's all go out

1196
01:53:07,213 --> 01:53:08,851
Mummy I want boneless
chicken

1197
01:53:12,218 --> 01:53:13,026
Tell me child,what do
you want?

1198
01:53:13,887 --> 01:53:14,865
Mummy boneless chicken

1199
01:53:17,223 --> 01:53:18,201
How much is it
brother?

1200
01:53:18,558 --> 01:53:20,196
Ten rupees a plate,how many
should I give?

1201
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,197
Give me two plates!

1202
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:22,869
What happened to the errand
I had told you

1203
01:53:23,229 --> 01:53:26,369
Why are you taking tension
I'll do your job,I'm there

1204
01:53:27,066 --> 01:53:29,046
It is a matter of tension,you
understand it

1205
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:36,049
Whose child is he?

1206
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:39,549
Is he from Pothia
or from somebody else?

1207
01:53:39,913 --> 01:53:42,393
Hey,come here
- My name is Abhay

1208
01:53:43,082 --> 01:53:45,562
Look at him,he's
too smart

1209
01:53:47,187 --> 01:53:50,066
He's exactly like Pothia
hey,what do you say?-

1210
01:53:50,590 --> 01:53:53,230
We'll give him excellent
training -

1211
01:53:53,526 --> 01:53:54,903
He'll even excel Pothia

1212
01:53:55,094 --> 01:53:56,232
I think,I'm right

1213
01:53:56,429 --> 01:54:00,571
Mumtaz,Uma,he's right,send
him to me for the training

1214
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:08,578
Hey sister,take the boneless
chicken and go

1215
01:54:10,443 --> 01:54:13,913
Mumtaz,make it fast,children
are getting late

1216
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:14,758
I'm coming

1217
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:20,596
You take this

1218
01:54:28,628 --> 01:54:29,936
Alright,I'll drop them
and come

1219
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:36,610
Pay concentration on studies
don't keep having fun

1220
01:54:39,973 --> 01:54:41,452
I felt very happy on
that day-

1221
01:54:42,642 --> 01:54:44,952
The day when my children
started going to an English school

1222
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:49,288
And for that,lqbal brother
helped me a lot

1223
01:54:50,984 --> 01:54:54,625
To educate children,to take
care of all their happiness-

1224
01:54:55,655 --> 01:55:00,297
That's it,this became my life
and also my dream

1225
01:55:01,995 --> 01:55:04,805
Didn't know how 7 years
passed off

1226
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:07,970
Abhay and Payal had
now grown up

1227
01:55:10,336 --> 01:55:14,648
As I grew older,like other
girls in the Beer bar-

1228
01:55:15,842 --> 01:55:19,984
Even I had become a
waitress from a Dancer

1229
01:56:11,564 --> 01:56:15,535
I'll make arrangements for you
don't worry,I'll see to it

1230
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:27,550
Mumtaz,got tired?
- Yes brother

1231
01:56:28,581 --> 01:56:29,582
Today,I had left early
from house-

1232
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:32,225
Payal had to go to
her school

1233
01:56:34,587 --> 01:56:37,067
And Mumtaz,how are
your both children?

1234
01:56:37,757 --> 01:56:38,394
They are fine

1235
01:56:40,093 --> 01:56:42,232
Abhay is too intelligent
at his studies

1236
01:56:43,096 --> 01:56:44,404
He say's,he'll become
a lawyer

1237
01:56:46,432 --> 01:56:50,903
And even Payal...
- Hey Mumtaz,don't see big dreams

1238
01:56:51,437 --> 01:56:52,575
But,never forget something-

1239
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:56,420
A person should never think
more than his level

1240
01:56:58,778 --> 01:57:01,088
But brother,it's different with
Abhay and Payal

1241
01:57:02,615 --> 01:57:05,755
Yes..it's okay with Abhay
he's a boy

1242
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:07,760
It hardly matters,if he
becomes a lawyer or not

1243
01:57:08,454 --> 01:57:10,263
If he doesn't become,he can
toil and eke his livelihood

1244
01:57:11,357 --> 01:57:13,769
But,you should think
about Payal

1245
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:20,103
Now look,I accomodated,both the
daughters of Rani at my Chembur bar

1246
01:57:21,467 --> 01:57:22,445
And that Lalita's daughter...

1247
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:26,283
Alright,you do one thing
send Payal to me

1248
01:57:26,472 --> 01:57:28,679
I'm opening my new Bar
at Meera Road,isn't it

1249
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:31,352
I'll name my bar
after your daughter

1250
01:57:32,812 --> 01:57:35,122
She'll earn more than you
- No brother...

1251
01:57:38,051 --> 01:57:39,792
Don't say any such thing
regarding Payal-

1252
01:57:42,655 --> 01:57:46,467
I'll never bring my daughter
in this line

1253
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:50,198
What?you'll not let her
come in this line? -

1254
01:57:50,997 --> 01:57:52,977
This was the work which
supported you at that time -

1255
01:57:53,499 --> 01:57:55,979
When all your pimp's left
you in lurch

1256
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:57,810
Brother,I know

1257
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:02,818
But,we both know,how
this line is-

1258
01:58:08,014 --> 01:58:09,493
My Payal will never
come here

1259
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:13,325
Mumtaz,there's a customer
for you

1260
01:58:39,378 --> 01:58:44,350
Bloody in the last 15 days
this is the 3rd extortion case

1261
01:58:44,884 --> 01:58:45,862
But,how is this done?

1262
01:58:46,886 --> 01:58:50,356
There's nothing,make a 1 rupee
phone call from a local phone

1263
01:58:50,890 --> 01:58:54,861
Give a threat and take away
the cash,what else?

1264
01:58:55,895 --> 01:58:59,866
I've heard,that Dhukad lane
Jhandu,our maxi -

1265
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,643
He has also earned money
in the same way

1266
01:59:06,906 --> 01:59:07,543
Come here...

1267
01:59:08,407 --> 01:59:08,885
What happened?

1268
01:59:09,242 --> 01:59:11,552
Hey Hero,yesterday why didn't
you come for playing cricket?

1269
01:59:12,578 --> 01:59:13,716
Sit down,will you have
half fry?

1270
01:59:13,913 --> 01:59:16,223
No,I've come to take the parcel of
minced meat for Yunus brother

1271
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:19,395
Dumb head,you'll take only
after it gets cooked,isn't it

1272
01:59:20,253 --> 01:59:22,062
Or will you take it half-cooked
and ask Yunus brother -

1273
01:59:22,255 --> 01:59:23,734
To get it cooked by
his concubine?

1274
01:59:25,491 --> 01:59:28,904
Hey...don't keep
having fun

1275
01:59:31,097 --> 01:59:31,905
Guddu,what I suggest is...

1276
01:59:33,266 --> 01:59:36,736
That even we make a phone call
to some Businessman

1277
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:38,911
Enjoy the cash,what...?

1278
01:59:39,172 --> 01:59:40,583
Hey,Is it that easy to
plunder cash?

1279
01:59:41,274 --> 01:59:45,416
Friend,there's nothing in it
a threat and an abuse-

1280
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:48,420
Both of these,take the shit
out of the best

1281
01:59:48,781 --> 01:59:50,590
People don't even go to
the police -

1282
01:59:51,284 --> 01:59:54,424
Because,they know,even
the police will finger -

1283
01:59:55,454 --> 01:59:58,765
Most of them,pay off
out of fear -

1284
01:59:58,958 --> 02:00:00,596
What...what do you say...?
I'm right,isn't it

1285
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,439
Abhay,your parcel is ready
take it and go

1286
02:00:02,628 --> 02:00:03,265
I'll leave...

1287
02:00:06,299 --> 02:00:08,108
Come back after giving the
parcel to Yunus brother

1288
02:00:08,301 --> 02:00:09,279
No,I've to study

1289
02:00:09,635 --> 02:00:10,443
What. . . .?
- I've to study

1290
02:00:16,142 --> 02:00:18,281
Hey Donkey,come here...
Come here

1291
02:00:19,645 --> 02:00:20,623
This is not the era
of studies -

1292
02:00:23,316 --> 02:00:25,626
It's the era of pistol...
understood

1293
02:00:25,985 --> 02:00:26,622
His shit has come out...

1294
02:00:26,986 --> 02:00:27,464
I'll leave

1295
02:00:27,653 --> 02:00:28,290
His shit has come out

1296
02:00:31,824 --> 02:00:33,462
After seeing the pistol,the
shit out of him came out

1297
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:37,638
Mummy,Abhay brother keeps roaming
around in the street -

1298
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:39,309
With his friends,Mohin
and his gang

1299
02:00:39,665 --> 02:00:41,144
And among them there's
one boy Sunil -

1300
02:00:41,334 --> 02:00:43,143
He keeps smoking all day

1301
02:00:43,836 --> 02:00:44,314
Is it?

1302
02:00:44,503 --> 02:00:46,312
Yes mummy
- I'll talk to him

1303
02:00:47,006 --> 02:00:47,814
Take the spinach also

1304
02:00:53,846 --> 02:00:55,325
How are you?
- I'm fine

1305
02:00:55,514 --> 02:00:56,822
How are you?
- I'm fine too

1306
02:00:57,516 --> 02:00:59,655
You were not to be seen
after you left the Beer bar?

1307
02:00:59,852 --> 02:01:02,492
Oh!yes,I've got married
he's my Husband

1308
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:07,500
Hey,you know him,he used
to visit the Beer bar

1309
02:01:08,527 --> 02:01:11,508
After an affair of 5 years
we've finally got married

1310
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:14,337
She's my daughter Payal

1311
02:01:15,034 --> 02:01:19,176
She has really grown up,come
home sometime with your children

1312
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,850
I stay at Jawahar nagar

1313
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:23,354
You can ask any one
Tenement No 4 -

1314
02:01:23,542 --> 02:01:25,351
Ask for Masood Brother
estate agent's Tenement

1315
02:01:26,045 --> 02:01:28,855
Hey,come,definitely come
okay Bye...

1316
02:01:30,549 --> 02:01:31,687
Hey,you remember that
Pothia...

1317
02:01:38,057 --> 02:01:38,694
Mumma,you've come?

1318
02:01:40,226 --> 02:01:41,705
You again went for playing
cricket,isn't it?

1319
02:01:44,730 --> 02:01:49,042
I didn't go alone,I went with
the neighbourhood boys

1320
02:01:49,735 --> 02:01:50,873
And what does this
Payal know?

1321
02:01:51,570 --> 02:01:52,548
I know everything

1322
02:01:53,406 --> 02:01:55,886
Look Abhay,I had already
stopped you -

1323
02:01:56,909 --> 02:01:59,219
Not to play with those
cheap street boys

1324
02:02:00,746 --> 02:02:02,225
This is your S.S.C year
Isn't it

1325
02:02:03,249 --> 02:02:04,557
Pay concentration on
your studies

1326
02:02:04,917 --> 02:02:06,225
Mumma,I'm doing that only

1327
02:02:10,089 --> 02:02:12,729
Mumma listen,day after tomorrow
there's a last match

1328
02:02:14,427 --> 02:02:16,065
Never after that

1329
02:02:17,096 --> 02:02:18,404
Are you sure?-Yes

1330
02:02:20,433 --> 02:02:21,411
Alright,now study

1331
02:02:32,945 --> 02:02:35,425
Hey,lift the bat and hit

1332
02:02:36,115 --> 02:02:37,924
Bloody he thinks himself
to be Sachin Tendulkar -

1333
02:02:38,451 --> 02:02:40,931
But,he's a good batsman

1334
02:02:42,121 --> 02:02:45,432
Hey,Dumb head,this is not
the era of batting -

1335
02:02:46,292 --> 02:02:48,602
It's the era of betting
understood

1336
02:02:49,462 --> 02:02:50,099
Excellent

1337
02:02:50,296 --> 02:02:53,937
Now-a-days,one gets more money
in getting out than in playing

1338
02:02:54,133 --> 02:02:54,770
Brother,you're right

1339
02:02:56,302 --> 02:02:57,280
Hey,Abhay have a smoke

1340
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:58,448
No,I don't smoke

1341
02:02:59,138 --> 02:03:01,618
Hey,smoke,I'm offering you an
imported cigarette free of cost

1342
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:02,785
Come on smoke
-forget it

1343
02:03:05,811 --> 02:03:06,789
Hey,slog it

1344
02:03:08,814 --> 02:03:09,622
Mohin,what do you say?

1345
02:03:09,815 --> 02:03:13,285
Hey,stupid people,can we make our lives
by playing this street cricket?

1346
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:15,962
We'll do betting on bigger
matches,understood?-

1347
02:03:16,155 --> 02:03:18,965
We've to make quick money
in our life,understood?

1348
02:03:19,658 --> 02:03:20,636
Oh God!police

1349
02:03:23,662 --> 02:03:24,640
I'll go for a leak
and come

1350
02:03:28,667 --> 02:03:30,806
Hey,first arrest those who
stay in the Khoja street

1351
02:03:32,505 --> 02:03:34,815
Hey,what are you doing here?
what's your name?

1352
02:03:35,841 --> 02:03:37,479
Arrest him...
- Come on, get up...

1353
02:03:39,512 --> 02:03:40,320
Where do you stay?

1354
02:03:40,513 --> 02:03:40,991
In Khoja street

1355
02:03:41,180 --> 02:03:41,817
What's your name?

1356
02:03:43,015 --> 02:03:43,652
What's your full name?

1357
02:03:45,351 --> 02:03:46,489
Sir,he's Pothia sawant's son

1358
02:03:46,685 --> 02:03:49,666
I see,he's Pothia sawant's son

1359
02:03:50,189 --> 02:03:51,167
Hey come...

1360

Hey,dump them into the jeep,they're
feeling too much of themselves

1361
02:03:55,694 --> 02:03:59,005
They're phoning a lot,they think
they're very smart,come...

1362
02:03:59,698 --> 02:04:01,006
Khan,start the jeep

1363
02:04:07,206 --> 02:04:09,846
Aunty,police has arrested
Abhay

1364
02:04:15,214 --> 02:04:17,694
I was trying to trace them out
for the last 30 days

1365
02:04:18,884 --> 02:04:20,522
Today they are caught

1366
02:04:21,053 --> 02:04:22,191
Bloody look at their age...

1367
02:04:22,721 --> 02:04:25,031
They haven't even got
their beard come out-

1368
02:04:25,724 --> 02:04:28,705
But,they called up a businessman
like Jain for extortion

1369
02:04:29,061 --> 02:04:32,372
Now,just watch,how we take
the shit out of you all?

1370
02:04:32,565 --> 02:04:33,703
But sir,I haven't done
anything

1371
02:04:33,899 --> 02:04:36,379
You...?Bloody you are the
father of all these

1372
02:04:36,569 --> 02:04:37,547
Sir,my son...

1373
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:41,718
What happened,what's your
problem?

1374
02:04:42,241 --> 02:04:43,219
Sir,Abhay is my son

1375
02:04:43,576 --> 02:04:44,384
Hey,stand out

1376
02:04:45,744 --> 02:04:50,386
Sir,he's my son,I think
you've brought him by mistake

1377
02:04:50,583 --> 02:04:52,893
We've not commited any mistake
your son has commited it

1378
02:04:53,419 --> 02:04:55,729
Bloody,he's giving a threat to
collect money over the phone

1379
02:04:56,755 --> 02:04:57,893
No...sir,he's not
like that-

1380
02:04:58,090 --> 02:05:00,070
Sir,he's a school going kid

1381
02:05:00,426 --> 02:05:03,407
Studies...bull shit

1382
02:05:03,929 --> 02:05:05,909
Bloody his father was
a pimp

1383
02:05:06,265 --> 02:05:08,905
And you...you're working in
a Beer bar

1384
02:05:09,268 --> 02:05:10,576
And your son will study?

1385
02:05:12,271 --> 02:05:13,750
But sir...he

1386
02:05:13,939 --> 02:05:15,919
Shut up,get out from here

1387
02:05:16,609 --> 02:05:18,589
Now look,how I'll harass
these Guys

1388
02:05:18,777 --> 02:05:22,418
No sir...he's a kid...
he doesn't...

1389
02:05:22,615 --> 02:05:24,754
Hey,make this lady
go out

1390
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:34,428
Come out...
- Go...Go...Go...

1391
02:05:43,969 --> 02:05:45,107
Hey Rickshaw,stop...

1392
02:05:47,973 --> 02:05:48,951
Abhay has...

1393
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:51,280
I came to know about it
you don't worry

1394
02:05:51,477 --> 02:05:53,787
I know a person who has
his hold in the police

1395
02:05:54,647 --> 02:05:56,627
He has his approach till the
higher officials,come with me

1396
02:05:56,815 --> 02:05:57,293
But,that Abhay...

1397
02:05:57,483 --> 02:05:59,622
Hey,you don't worry,get in...
- Alright

1398
02:05:59,985 --> 02:06:02,124
Go fast,take a left
down the road

1399
02:06:02,655 --> 02:06:04,464
Will Abhay get released?
-you don't worry

1400
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:11,631
So,this is the matter
its difficult

1401
02:06:13,332 --> 02:06:16,142
Look,this case is the extortion
of a big businessman

1402
02:06:17,169 --> 02:06:18,307
And even the section
is serious

1403
02:06:20,172 --> 02:06:22,982
Hey,the businessmen who have
been given the threat of extortion

1404
02:06:23,175 --> 02:06:24,984
They are all big people,they
are not any Tom dick or Harry

1405
02:06:25,678 --> 02:06:26,816
And it's a problematic case

1406
02:06:27,846 --> 02:06:30,827
But...my son has
done nothing,really...

1407
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:34,831
Hey,may be your son is innocent
who's going to believe?

1408
02:06:36,355 --> 02:06:37,993
Will anybody believe?
- No one

1409
02:06:39,024 --> 02:06:40,332
ls your son a film star?

1410
02:06:40,693 --> 02:06:44,835
We'll have to take your son
out from that room

1411
02:06:45,364 --> 02:06:47,674
The approach has to be stressed
till the Top officials,understood?

1412
02:06:49,034 --> 02:06:52,015
It'll cost you very high for
his release,better understand

1413
02:06:52,705 --> 02:06:53,342
How much will it cost?

1414
02:06:55,541 --> 02:07:00,684
We'll have to give Shankar...
even to that person,isn't it

1415
02:07:02,381 --> 02:07:03,189
It'll cost you 1 lakh

1416
02:07:04,717 --> 02:07:07,527
Hey,the Businessmen who have
been threatened of extortion

1417
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:09,529
They have bribed all the
Top officials

1418
02:07:13,559 --> 02:07:15,869
Hey Babu,call up later,I'm
in a meeting

1419
02:07:23,068 --> 02:07:25,048
So...What have you thought?

1420
02:07:25,571 --> 02:07:28,711
Bhau...reduce a little bit
she's all alone,poor woman

1421
02:07:28,907 --> 02:07:30,045
Why do you cry?

1422
02:07:31,744 --> 02:07:33,223
Alright,just because it's
a child's case

1423
02:07:33,412 --> 02:07:35,221
I'll settle down for
70,000 or 75,000

1424
02:07:36,248 --> 02:07:38,558
Hey,it's okay,if I don't
get my cut

1425
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:41,231
Now,make arrangement for
the cash at your earliest

1426
02:07:41,420 --> 02:07:43,229
Tomorrow,it's sunday and day-after
it's Monday

1427
02:07:43,422 --> 02:07:45,561
If this matter prolongs till
Monday,it'll become a charge sheet

1428
02:07:45,758 --> 02:07:48,398
I'll not be able to do anything
I'm not God,understood

1429
02:07:51,096 --> 02:07:52,905
Now Go...
- Mumtaz,come

1430
02:07:54,099 --> 02:07:56,579
Human factor should prevail
in our Business

1431
02:07:57,936 --> 02:07:58,744
Yes,I'm coming there only

1432
02:07:59,104 --> 02:08:01,243
Sir,I haven't done anything
sir,we haven't done anything

1433
02:08:01,774 --> 02:08:03,412
Those boys who called up
belong to the other street

1434
02:08:03,609 --> 02:08:09,082
Sir,please leave us,we haven't
done anything,let us go,leave us...

1435
02:08:17,956 --> 02:08:20,596
This is 12,000 or 12,500-

1436
02:08:22,795 --> 02:08:25,435
By pledging all these,we'll not
get more than 25,000 or 30,000

1437
02:08:27,466 --> 02:08:32,609
Meaning,we are still
short of 50,000

1438
02:08:33,639 --> 02:08:34,777
Mumtaz,now what
can we do?

1439
02:08:35,641 --> 02:08:36,619
When the need arises

1440
02:08:36,809 --> 02:08:38,447
Even the new goods are sold
half the price

1441
02:08:40,813 --> 02:08:42,793
Payal,you go out

1442
02:08:53,992 --> 02:08:56,302
I'll make arrangements
for 10,000

1443
02:08:59,832 --> 02:09:00,810
Should I talk to brother?

1444
02:09:04,503 --> 02:09:05,982
Do you think,he'll
do something?

1445
02:09:07,172 --> 02:09:09,652
We'll at least talk
- Do it

1446
02:09:21,687 --> 02:09:24,327
Brother,I'm Mumtaz speaking

1447
02:09:24,690 --> 02:09:26,829
Hey,where are you,today,why
didn't you come?

1448
02:09:28,193 --> 02:09:33,336
That...Brother that...police
has arrested Abhay

1449
02:09:33,532 --> 02:09:34,670
Brother,they are making
a false case on him

1450
02:09:37,202 --> 02:09:41,173
They say,it'll cost 50,000
for his release

1451
02:09:41,373 --> 02:09:43,683
Mumtaz,didn't I warn you
to keep Abhay under control?

1452
02:09:44,042 --> 02:09:46,022
Now,where will so much of
money come from?

1453
02:09:48,046 --> 02:09:52,358
Brother,I was thinking that
if you could lend me

1454
02:09:52,718 --> 02:09:54,356
I would very soon
repay it...

1455
02:09:55,053 --> 02:09:57,863
Now,from where will I arrange
in such a short notice?

1456
02:09:58,223 --> 02:10:01,204
Today,even the Business is dull
It's the 5th month running

1457
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:04,200
You know everything,the
cash box is empty

1458
02:10:04,563 --> 02:10:05,871
I gave the police it's share
Isn't it

1459
02:10:11,236 --> 02:10:15,048
Alright,Alright no problem

1460
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:26,552
I knew it,bloody that Bastard
pimp is speaking a lie

1461
02:10:44,436 --> 02:10:45,915
Should I call up the
customers?

1462
02:10:57,616 --> 02:11:01,257
I know,that you don't want
to do all these,but...

1463
02:11:40,659 --> 02:11:44,300

Hey,will you tell me the
name (Brand) of that liquor?

02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:17,320
Take...Come on,go...

1537
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:20,648
Full arrangement for the
cash is not yet done

1538
02:20:20,845 --> 02:20:24,315
Hey Mumtaz,why do you worry,we've
time till the morning,isn't it

1539
02:20:24,516 --> 02:20:25,824
We'll find out some way

1540
02:20:26,184 --> 02:20:27,322
We'll even try convincing
Bhau

1541
02:20:29,187 --> 02:20:33,658
Don't get worried,be courageous
don't get weak,I'm there,isn't it

1542
02:20:34,359 --> 02:20:35,337
We'll get Abhay released

1543
02:21:46,264 --> 02:21:48,904
You developed dysentry for
such a trivial matter

1544
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:50,408
Who's the sir over there?

1545
02:21:52,103 --> 02:21:55,573
He's gone to Pune,he'll come
tomorrow,call me up tomorrow

1546
02:21:55,773 --> 02:21:57,753
No...there's no trouble
in it

1547
02:21:57,942 --> 02:22:00,422
The medicine for all the aliments
is only one,Chandrakant Bhau

1548
02:22:01,279 --> 02:22:02,587
Call me up tomorrow

1549
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:20,933
Take him...take your son
happy...?

1550
02:22:50,995 --> 02:22:52,633
Mumma,I'll go...

1551
02:23:14,352 --> 02:23:18,323
Abhay,you've not had anything
since afternoon,have something

1552
02:23:27,198 --> 02:23:28,836
From when will you resume
going to school?

1553
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:33,508
I'm asking you...

1554
02:23:36,374 --> 02:23:38,513
Abhay,what has happened to
you,why don't you speak?

1555
02:23:57,395 --> 02:24:00,865
Abhay,did you understand,don't
get scared,we are all with you

1556
02:24:01,065 --> 02:24:02,203
Don't get scared...don't...

1557
02:24:07,405 --> 02:24:10,875
He was Mohin ,isn't it,why
did he come here?

1558
02:24:13,578 --> 02:24:16,388
Didn't I tell you to stay
away from them?

1559
02:24:17,915 --> 02:24:19,223
You went to the Jail
because of them

1560
02:24:21,419 --> 02:24:22,727
Don't you understand this?

1561
02:24:23,921 --> 02:24:24,729
Do you understand?

1562
02:24:30,928 --> 02:24:35,570
Where are you going...what did
I ask...what...?

1563
02:24:37,602 --> 02:24:41,414
What's this...what's this
show it to me...

1564
02:24:41,939 --> 02:24:47,912
Abhay...where are you
going,stop...

1565
02:28:27,665 --> 02:28:29,975
Time took away Abhay
very far from me

1566
02:28:31,002 --> 02:28:32,982
Payal became the dancer
of Beer bar

1567
02:28:34,338 --> 02:28:38,480
I wanted to see my future
in my children

1568
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:42,150
But I only found my
past in them

1569
02:28:43,681 --> 02:28:48,494
And I...even I,like the
other Beer bar girls

1570
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:53,900
Got into that crowd,where there
was no Identity of mine left
