And if I've linked
my Aadhar card

159
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,240
Nothing worked out
So we came to you

160
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,400
Bank officers will sanction loans
to expert con men

161
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,280
And grant in billions readily

162
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,280

even 10 paise to honest souls

Sir, definitely

174
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,280
You shouldn't later on
bargain about my %

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,640
No, I give you my word, sir

176
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,440

Now a lot of rich men don't know
the list of their own properties

178
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,440
Some people invest in property here
and then settle abroad

179
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,400
We must find such a land
to submit as surety for you

180
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,040
- Did you understand?
- No

181
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,680
We don't get it, sir

182
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,760
No big deal

183
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,960
Assume you own 4800 sqft in Ashok Nagar

184
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,120
If you submit those documents in any bank
you'll get 5 million

185
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,000
You take the loan
Pay my commission

186
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,640
But we don't own any land, sir

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,360
- You do
- We may get into a mess, sir

188
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,920
Please suggest some other option

189
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,320
Why are you so scared to lie
to the bank and get a loan?

190
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
Don't they cheat us
in many hidden ways?

191
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,920
ATMs were started
since banks were crowded

192
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,080
Now they charge us when
we withdraw our own money

193
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,080
You come across only people
who take loans and don't pay

194
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
Do you know people
who cheat to sanction loans?

195
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,480
Such a team is involved in this scheme

196
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Once you repay the loans
you can get rid of your documents

197
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,400
I will take the commission and leave

198
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Using this technology
I have got loans for 500 people

199
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,240
They have excelled in their business
and are ruling their roost

200
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,320
As 501st client if you get us a loan
we can settle down in life, sir

201
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,560
Please, sir

202
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,760
Okay

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,160
Thanks, sir

204
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,400
'Welcome entrepreneur'

205
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,040

the ring and chain right away'

206
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,080

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,000

Then why be confused?"

213
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,640

218
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,400
'Trichy'

219
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,280
"Out with the old, on with the new"

220
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,200
"A dot then, now a lot, dude"

221
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,800

In good also, bad dwells too"

"Car and comforts will follow

251
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,880
You have started
your own travel agency

252
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,200
This is a long overdue vow

253
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
Shall we go to Thiruttani
and Thiruchendur in our car?

254
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't own the car fully as yet

255
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,240
I'm still paying the due

256
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,560
I'll send you at the right time
to these temples, come

257
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,760
Rs 20,000, sir
Count it

258
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,520
Tell me

259
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,600
Looks like you are now
an established businessman

260
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,400
Sit down

261
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,600
Sir!

262
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
My neck is paining
Sit over there

263
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
You are the surety

264
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,920
You are the land owner

265
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,000
How long are you into these con jobs?

266
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,360
Sir, you've got it all wron-

267
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,080
Hey! I'll smash your face
beyond recognition

268
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,560
He is already an approver

269
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,320
Forgive me

270
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,000
Tell me the truth verbatim

271
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,200
We borrowed money
only to start our own travel agency

272
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,040
Samuel sir arranged the documents

273
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,880
How can you think
of new ways to con people?

274
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,400
What is his name?

275
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,280
Samuel

276
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,720
Call him

277
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,920
His number is not reachable
Looks like he bolted

278
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,880
- Hey!
- Sir?

279
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,320
We have cast a net
to nab the entire team

280
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,440
Sir!

281
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,640
Your family is totally in the dark

282
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,520
If I put you behind bars now
your family will crumble to pieces

283
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,360
You'll be begging on the streets
like an insolvent pauper

284
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,440
Hey surety!
The same applies to you too

285
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,960
You'll sign as witness
to an asset you don't own, huh?

286
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm getting married next week, sir

287
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,600
- Go ahead
- My planets are badly aligned

288
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,240
- So...?
- Wedding preparations are on

289
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,840
If this is TV headlines
it will be truly a disgrace, sir

290
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,160
Shall I order cable connection
only in your house?

291
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,560
We are paying our dues regularly

292
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,200
We intend to tear the documents
once we pay up, sir

293
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
You came unexpected-

294
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,960
'We haven't cheated anyone'

295
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
Please believe us

296
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,920
Please, sir

297
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,840
I'll fall at your feet

298
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,400
How dare you touch me!

299
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,000
You have cheated
to the tune of 5 million

300
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,320
Either I need a reward
for the work I have done

301
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,520
If not I should benefit
in a befitting-

302
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,880
You let us know
We can do the needful, sir

303
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,320
Hey! Greasing my palm
a little won't do

304
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,160
You thought I was a traffic policeman?

305
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,240
1000000

306
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,600
500000 each

307
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
Should reach me
within 2 days

308
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,760
Make arrangements for that

309
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,280
How can we wangle so much?

310
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,400
We are managing our cash
on a rotation basis

311
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,280
Be a little considerate, sir

312
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,400
What, I say?
Are you bargaining?

313
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,480
So many like you
have fallen in this trap

314
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,920
I can save whoever pays me first
from counting bars in jail!

315
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,360
Even I should show accounts

316
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,800
Sir, I can't-

317
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,640
You steal, loot or
resort to murder

318
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
All I need is money

319
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,640
2 days

320
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,200
If you line my pocket
I'll clear all the evidence

321
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,520
Will you shell out without fail
or face hell in jail?

322
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
Focus on only these 2 options

323
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,960
'This is me'

324
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,920
'Whatever happens is for the good'
is an old saying'

325
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,880
'I don't know how to handle
the cards life has dealt me'

326
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,240
'Now I don't even have
Rs 10,000 on me'

327
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,360
'But in just 2 days
I need 1 million'

328
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
'If don't manage this...'

329
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,640
'...I don't know
how I'll face my family'

330
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,320
'My friend is also in a soup
because of me'

331
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,080
'Whomever I ask for a loan, refuse
though I know they can afford to lend'

332
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,480
'Fingers crossed, as if a savior
won't walk into my life!'

333
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,000
Sir, ice cube?

334
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
- Add and then drink
- Get lost!

335
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,320
Let's go

336
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,560
Bro, did Kishore come here?

337
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,720
No one came here

338
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,080
The word 'cash' makes them run a mile!

339
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,880
Brother!

340
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,680
I tried my level best

341
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,360
Even if we have 1 month
it's difficult to arrange

342
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,520
Let's ask if we can
return in installments?

343
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,360
I tried that option
Not budging an inch

344
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,280
If we don't deliver
we are dead meat!

345
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,040
Even if we sell everything
we'll get only 2 to 3 lakhs

346
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,520
We should do something

347
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,360
- Bro, did you ask Chandru?
- Which Chandru?

348
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,760
Let me ask him

349
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,160
As soon as I booze
I feel like peeing

350
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,600
What is the time?

351
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,960
I'll go to the wash room

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,400
Sorry, it was a mistake

353
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,040
- Don't you have eyes?
- Don't get angry, boss

354
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,040
We are boozing with borrowed money!

355
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,640
- You spilt it all over
- Don't get upset, boss

356
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,960
See, I have my wallet
I have wads of cash inside

357
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,680
No problem, you can drink
to your heart's content, boss

358
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,680
I'll take care

359
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,560
Turning-hand touching-booze spilling

360
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,640
Don't get angry, boss

361
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,520
Bar boy! Serve them
whatever they ask

362
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,680
Bill every peg to me
Please sit down, boss

363
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,440
Have your fill
Sorry, boss

364
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,000
Hey! Is he mad or what?

365
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,040
He spilt my drink and is paying for it!

366
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,600
He readily agreed
to pay our bills

367
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,000
Who is he?

368
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,920
Hello, come here

369
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,600
Who is he?

370
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
He is our regular customer

371
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,000
He'll tip me
2000 or 3000 easily

372
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,560
He's stinking rich
Don't disturb him

373
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,920
'Stinking rich' means?

374
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,240
Will he give 1 million if we ask?

375
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,040
- It's no big deal
- What do you mean?

376
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,360
Even I have borrowed 200000 from him!

377
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,400
Appearances are deceptive

378
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,280
Once he likes you,
he'll do anything for you

379
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,760
All that is fine
Why does he like you?

380
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,480
- That's a little strange!
- Don't be mean, sir

381
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,000
Have your fill, boss

382
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,720
Forget the fact he took
a fancy to the waiter

383
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,640
Why is he staring at you?

384
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,920
That's right, bro
Why is he looking at me?

385
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,200
- I think he's that!
- Who?

386
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,680
'I'm so sure'

387
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,560
Bro...?

388
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,280
- He can't take his eyes off me?
- Like you're a chic chick!

389
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
Don't put 2 + 2 and come up with 5

390
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,080
I'm getting married in a week
Don't mess up my married life

391
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,840
Very tasty, serve whoever ordered it

392
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,400
Sir, it's for you

393
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,880
Yov! We are in no state to ord-

394
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,200
We didn't order this
You got the table wrong

395
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,560
Sir, I didn't get it wrong

396
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,200
Gajendran sir ordered it for you

397
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,200
Gajendran sir, huh?

398
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,240
That's my gift

399
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Hey! Confirmed

400
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,720
'No doubt whatsoever'

401
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,200
I think the cash he gave us
is an advance for you

402
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,480
Here you go, but listen
to a piece of advice

403
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,440
Stop staring back at him

404
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,680
As if I'm looking at him?

405
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
- He started it
- Starter, sir

406
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,520
Aiyaiyo! I don't want to
come in between this duo!

407
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,920
You finish your job
I'll see you in the morning

408
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,600
Sit down
He's going overboard

409
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,640
How can he think that of me?
I'll fling this cash on his face

410
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,040
Yov! Who are you?

411
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,600
Why did you order for me?

412
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,040
- All I did was order food
- Don't touch me

413
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,360
If I reach out to you
won't you reciprocate?

414
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,040
Why should I return favors?

415
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,400
When you offered cash
I thought as much

416
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I'm not the kind of person
you think I am

417
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,600
Boss, likewise
I'm not what you think I am!

418
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,080
I ordered only because
you're Keerthi's brother

419
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,560
Sincere love, boss!

420
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,240
I wanted to impress you

421
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,040
Listen, I don't know anything
about love and Keerthi

422
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,160
If I set eyes on you again-

423
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,240
What's up with you?

424
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,840
I haven't hit him as yet

425
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,080
You forgot your sister
because of your booze

426
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,680
Bro, we have 101 problems

427
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,040
Let this be 102

428
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,840
- Please help
- It's a mistaken identity case

429
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,560
I saw him with his sister
in the shopping mall

430
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
- I'll show the photo
- You got a sister?

431
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,200
He is blabbering
Can't you see he's mad?

432
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,120
Who is mad?
You, right?

433
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,520
Is this you?

434
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,440
Sorry, boss, brother-in-law
You're my machan!

435
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,760
- Take a look, boss
- Hey! It's you

436
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,400
Take a proper look
Isn't this you?

437
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,640
This is your sister?

438
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,000
Isn't this you?

439
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,200
- This girl?
- See, he agreed

440
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,120
Boss, I love your sister sincerely

441
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,120
I flipped for her eyes

442
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,800
I'll treat her like a queen
I'm very affluent

443
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,080
I'm a millionaire and I don't know
what to do with my money

444
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,480
Every time I think of your sister
butterflies fly in my heart

445
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,720
Do you know how
they flit and fly?

446
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,720
Won't you drive carefully?

447
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,920
I switched on the indicator

448
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,480
You'll switch it on suddenly, huh?

449
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,280
- Why did you bang madam's car?
- They were wrong

450
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,560
She was right

451
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,200
'- Ask them
- Who are you?'

452
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,360
- Their fault
- I'll handle this

453
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,320
Shouldn't you be careful
taking your sister?

454
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,160
- She's my girlfriend
- Really?

455
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,360
Why is your taste so bad?

456
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,480
- Wait, sir
- It's okay, sir

457
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
Wait, I am there for you

458
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,520
Will you leave us alone?
I'll take care

459
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,640
I know the cops in this area
I can handle it

460
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,160
- Got your RC book?
- Yes

461
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,760
- License and ration card
- Why, sir?

462
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,320
- Is your Aadhar card connected?
- How is that relevant?

463
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,680
You know to connect her, huh?

464
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,840
- Don't drag her in this
- Don't retort, I'll bash you

465
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,840
- It's okay, we are getting late
- Wait, I am there

466
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,120
- Got a helmet?
- At home

467
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,240
I meant the bike's helmet!

468
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,400
You're insulting me again

469
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,280
Letting your tongue run
Note down the #, sir

470
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,720
Madam, you note it down

471
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,200
- What #?
- Note down my #

472
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,760
- Tell him
- 9944332222

473
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,600
- No need
- Note it down as Smart boy Gaja

474
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
Why do we need your name?

475
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
- Let's go
- You go, I'll take care

476
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,280
Madam

477
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,200
Wow! Back super!

478
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,640
I meant your handbag

479
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,960
'What a beautiful smile!'

480
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,680
'Look at the 'elimination face' with her'

481
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,960
'Don't befriend her'

482
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
If it was my area
you'll be dead meat

483
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,120
Get lost, rowdy!

484
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,120
Hey! Go to that corner and drink

485
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,960
Boss, what is this?

486
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,720
Building!

487
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,480
Now I know why you have a tea shop

488
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
Am I dumb, you dumbass?
What is written there?

489
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,320
Language institute

490
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,080
What does that mean?

491
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,120
Get lost!
We are busy talking

492
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,880
Boss, answer my question

493
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,040
[Gibberish outpouring]

494
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,240
Using cuss words fluently
isn't good for the family

495
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,440
Stop it, boss

496
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,160
I'm behaving so decent
Why are you using cuss words?

497
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,560
I've been in 10th grade thrice

498
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,720
I must join this place
What should I do?

499
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,600
Anyone with money can join

500
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,080
Don't be a dog in the manger
ruining my clientele!

501
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,360
How dare you!
I'll splash hot water on your face

502
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,760
I am 10th grade for 3 years

503
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm an engineer
running a tea stall!

504
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,760
- Aren't you the new student?
- Yes, sir

505
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,120
Ram killed Ravan
Change the voice

506
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,040
Sir, Rama killed Ravana
I should change the voice, right?

507
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,880
Do you know?

508
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,160
Rama killed Ravana

509
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,800
Is it correct, sir?

510
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,160
Silence! I asked you to change
from Active to Passive voice

511
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,440
'Not into artiste's voice'

512
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,760
'Who asked you to join
Advanced Spoken English course?'

513
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,600
I've paid Rs 5000 as advance too

514
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,120
I can see that
Go and sit in the last row

515
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,160
Concentrate, man

516
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,000
Hey...hey!

517
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,680
You nitwit!
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

518
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,960
He and I are friends

519
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,040
Focus on your work, useless

520
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,480
'He's trying to hit on you'

521
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,600
Boss, why are you sitting here
when sir asked you to go back?

522
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,600
Your 'sir' who sent me to the last row
is lying in bed #301 in Suriya hospital

523
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,400
Want to occupy the bed next to his?

524
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,840
Shall we become friends then?

525
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,560
- Here you go
- What is this, boss?

526
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,920
1-finger shake will do for you
Can't waste a handshake

527
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,960
'Yellow top, wow!
She says 'yes' I'll woo her'

528
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,400
'Be alert'

529
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Thanks

530
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,480
'I shouldn't wash this hand
whole of today'

531
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,640
'Why isn't she turning back?'

532
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,040
Look back

533
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,320
'This is how we often meet up,
chat, smile, spend time'

534
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,680
'With my 1-track mind
I followed her like her shadow'

535
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
'I got a nasty surprise
She was absent for 4 days'

536
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,320
'I got all flustered
and freaked out, boss'

537
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,840
'I asked the boys
what the reason was'

538
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,800
She loves you for sure, boss

539
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
She kept saying
she missed Gaja

540
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,000
'If he doesn't come, my parents
will get me married to a foreigner'

541
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,360
She felt so bad and she cried
even I felt awful, boss

542
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,440
- She actually mentioned my name?
- You bet, boss

543
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,680
- Here's extra leg-piece for you
- Why would we lie?

544
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,600
Bro, 1 black pepper chicken

545
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,280
'His golden chance
to kill the golden goose!'

546
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,960
I would have called you, boss

547
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,920
But my phone doesn't charge,
I'm unable to call, keeps hanging

548
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,920
I feel like throwing it

549
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,400
Do it then

550
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,520
Here, buy a new phone for yourself

551
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Okay, thanks

552
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,320
All this is true, huh?

553
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,360
Truth, right?
Don't you know English?

554
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,000
I swear that girl will die
without you in her life

555
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,960
I'll die without her in my life, boss

556
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,880
1st thing in the morning
I'll ask for her hand

557
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
Let me see what happens

558
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,000
'This is the route
her dad takes daily'

559
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,200
'Here he is
Go for it'

560
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,800
Who are you?

561
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Light the camphor

562
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,720
- Why are you doing this?
- I want to become your son-in-law

563
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,480
'I think this moron's
upper storey is empty'

564
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,120
I have an eye on your daughter

565
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,600
Don't hit me

566
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,280
No fight
Mr Rash, don't

567
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,120
People are staring at us

568
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,280
Get lost!

569
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,880
'He shooed me respectfully!

570
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,280
Everyone is gawking at me

571
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,640
- Are you serious?
- Yes

572
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,560
I didn't even know this
though I'm her cousin

573
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,040
Even now her family insists
she should marry a foreigner

574
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,800
And she's being tortured, boss

575
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,120
You know how my heart aches

576
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,240
If you convince her to be my wife
I'll do anything for you

577
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,120
- Anything?
- Whatever!

578
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,520
We had borrowed 1 million
from Keerthi's dad to start a business

579
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,520
We are unable to repay him

580
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,320
So I don't know
how I can face him

581
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,320
Is money God's gift to mankind?

582
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,960
1st find out if your sister is alright

583
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,200
Give me your account number
I'll transfer in a jiffy, boss

584
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
A/c #?
1 minute

585
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,920
Hey! Shut up
You're in a drunken stupor now

586
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,000
Tomorrow talk to us
when you're sober just like this

587
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,680
We'll try and solve your love matter

588
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,480
I'm sober only when I'm drunk
Otherwise I end up blabbering

589
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,320
- Trust me
- Call me in this #

590
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,920
I'll follow you

591
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,200
Why did you rush out like that?
I could have easily convinced him

592
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,440
- He's fully tanked
- Junk of a jackass!

593
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
How do you know his girl?

594
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,560
Didn't I tell you I saw
a chic chick in that showroom?

595
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,080
Textile showroom?

596
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,600
Sir, how much does your bill come to?

597
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
Rs 2000

598
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,960
I've bought for 3000

599
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,200
We get 1000 bucks off
if we buy for Rs 5000

600
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,960
Shall we bill together
and share the 1000, 50/50?

601
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,240
Sure, by all means

602
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,760
Same bill

603
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,520
'But they walked in separately
Now they claim to be together'

604
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,680
Why are you hesitating, sir?

605
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,880
If you bill both together
we can avail your discount

606
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,120
He's my first cousin

607
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,480
He's her cousin
I'll use him as bait

608
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,000
Her dad's brother's son!

609
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,400
Don't take a dig at me
I'll lose my cool

610
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,160
But let me tell you
she's a real hot chick

611
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,760
I wanted to get to know her
But it was all a dead end

612
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,760
I got engaged by then

613
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,680
I just let go
of my feelings for her

614
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,320
You sacrificed, huh?

615
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,160
I'll clobber you
Shall I tell your fiancee?

616
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,000
- Hey! Don't
- Then behave yourself

617
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,600
Was she that stunning?

618
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,160
- Got her snap?
- Simply soooper

619
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,040
Your phone has been ringing
from early morning

620
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,680
How long will you keep sleeping?

621
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,400
Get up and check
who the caller is

622
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,840
Tell me

623
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,720
He's crystal clear

624
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,680
- Who?
- The loaded guy at the bar

625
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,040
He has deposited 0.2 million
in my account as advance

626
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,680
Like Sasikumar in 'Nadodi'
Just 1 simple favor

627
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,280
If we do just that...

628
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,200
'...all our problems will be solved'

629
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,400
I enquired about him

630
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,680
He genuinely loves her

631
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,120
He even showed me the selfie
he has taken with that girl

632
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,400
'We were chatting'

633
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,120
He suddenly started crying

634
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,840
Shouldn't let go of this goose

635
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,280
'He's a naive idiot of the 1st order'

636
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,360
We should milk him dry

637
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,440
'He has no clue
how to spend his money'

638
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,160
'He is the need of the hour for us'

639
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,640
- Can we trust him?
- I did a thorough check

640
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,160
He's really loaded

641
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,680
He has already
deposited cash, right?

642
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,960
What more do you want?

643
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,640
I can't even imagine
that girl next to him

644
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,000
She spoke to me
for just a discount of Rs 500

645
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,840
You think she'll let go of him
if she knew he's a millionaire

646
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,000
'Money is everything'

647
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,680
If only I was that rich, I'll revel
with Tamannaah and Hansika next to me

648
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,480
And even click a selfie
like our Saravana Stores 'annachi'

649
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,240
Your lame dialogs
when I just got up

650
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,600
I have no option but to agree

651
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,680
But I have to meet him
before we forge ahead

652
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,440
Brother, you love her, okay

653
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,080
But does she love you in return?

654
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,200
How can you ask me
such a question?

655
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,800
Will I buy you colored cool drinks
if I thought she didn't love me?

656
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,280
Just reply to my question
crisp and clear

657
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,680
If we refer your name
will she come here?

658
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,760
Why do you want to call
my girlfriend with my name?

659
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,320
For your sake, brother

660
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,520
Don't mistake me
I'm sure she'll come

661
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,200
This is enough, brother

662
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,120
I need to share an important
piece of news

663
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,040
We have a load of problems
We can't explain all that to you

664
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,240
She's his sister

665
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,960
So if something goes wrong
it will end in a family feud, right?

666
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Your over enthusiasm has also
got you an earful and handful

667
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,760
And your face has been registered well

668
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,680
So till I tell you
don't go anywhere near her

669
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,720
No one should know
we are behind this

670
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,440
Especially your girlfriend shouldn't know

671
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,360
You'll ensure Keerthi is always happy
after you both get married, right?

672
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,560
I won't even let her chop onions!

673
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,720
- Promise?
- I swear on my aunt!

674
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
This promise will do

675
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,080
At the end of the day
after marriage we are same family

676
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,600
He's the outsider

677
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,160
I trust you too, boss

678
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,840
We are also helping you
only because we trust you

679
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,760
- What about the payment?
- That can be done

680
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,080
Add GST to it
plus service tax too

681
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,600
Also sister's sched-

682
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,760
My girlfriend, boss

683
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,160
- She's sister to us
- 'Awesome, boss'

684
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,440
Find out your sister's regular schedule
We must plan accordingly

685
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,920
Haven't I told you already?

686
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,560
Bah! You beat us hollow
in your updates, soooper!

687
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,080
We'll look into the rest of the plan

688
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,000
Your job is only to look after, okay?

689
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,960
'Listen, that girl stays put at home
from 9:00 a.m to 4:00 p.m'

690
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,360
'She will sometimes just visit
Lord Muruga temple nearby'

691
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,160
'At 4:00 p.m on the dot
she goes to her coaching class'

692
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,080
'Now even that is cut
after her father hit our boss'

693
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,600
'They are trying to find
a foreign groom for her'

694
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,120
'Regarding that,
they have sent her out'

695
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,720
'She'll get back home by 10:00 p.m'

696
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,880
How are you so sure?

697
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,480
'Thinking he was hatching a silent plan'

698
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,880
...her dad was talking so loudly
That's why I'm so accurate

699
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,000
Kidnapping the girl is the tough part
Getting a car is a cakewalk for me

700
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,280
Don't get it

701
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,760
Kidnapping the girl is the tough part
Getting a car is a cakewalk for me

702
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,640
You should give the phone
at a specified time-

703
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
Did you tell the bartender?

704
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,480
Won't I do even this for Gaja sir?

705
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,560
What should I do now?

706
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,280
When you signal, the phone
should be in their house, that's all?

707
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,000
He'll do it as soon as
you signal him

708
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,920
- Be ready
- I'm scared

709
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,720
- What is it?
- Good evening, sir

710
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,880
I came to deliver
the food you ordered, sir

711
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,000
We didn't order any food

712
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,920
The order was booked
only from this address

713
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,920
Check the address

714
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,840
- Please take this, sir
- I didn't order it

715
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,440
Take this, sir

716
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,320
Coming from Swiggy
You had ordered food

717
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Whaaat?

718
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,200
You've come to the wrong place
I never ordered any food

719
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,160
- Which is door # 2191?
- Right there

720
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,280
Will you go there?

721
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,360
- Why are you coming in?
- You ordered food

722
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
I've been repeatedly saying we didn't

723
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,320
Who are you?

724
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,080
You ordered Aasife 'biriyani'
You didn't pick my call

725
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,680
But I didn't order
I've been saying this

726
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,680
You're sounding like a broken record

727
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,680
You ask me to pay,
I should oblige, huh?

728
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,760
Pay the bill, sir
We'll clear out at once

729
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,520
You said she will be home by 10:00 p.m

730
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,280
She'll be here soon, let's wait

731
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,240
You call the #
this was ordered from

732
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,640
Good idea

733
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,160
You're talking utter nonsense

734
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,360
Ringing, huh?

735
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,160
It's ringing from your house
Are you pulling a fast one?

736
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,640
Whose phone is that?

737
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,920
Keep an eye

738
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,600
We didn't order any food

739
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,360
Pay up, sir
Don't keep us waiting

740
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,600
Hey! Look

741
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,120
That's the girl

742
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,440
'You keep arguing'

743
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
Why should I pay
for someone else's order?

744
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,840
Looks like a squabble
Let me go and check

745
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,400
Stay in the car

746
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,680
You get in from that side

747
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,800
What happened, sir?

748
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,400
Why are you getting out?
We are here to rescue you

749
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,600
Don't be scared

750
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,520

Don't tug my beard

753

Do whatever you want
I won't pay you

754
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,760
Do something
I can't handle her

755
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,080
Why are you hassling us?

756
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,480

Hey you!

762
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,080
Go straight

763
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,560
Call him

764
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,440
Hello, boss?

765
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,080
Regarding Gajendran's love issue

766
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,920
What is it?

767
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
He has nailed us in

768
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,920
Has he got caught
in that girl's house?

769
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,440
He didn't talk to me

770
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,600
- His wife did!
- Whaaat?

771
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,520
What the hell do you mean?

772
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,200
Hey! How dare you!
'Imp' with a P in front!

773
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,000
I'm here in flesh and blood as his wife

775

'I am hunting for you'

776
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,680
He said he was in love with her

777
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,520
I'm such a lovely parakeet in his life

778
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,840
He looks like a wild cat
and he wants another girlfriend?

779
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,160
You...a parrot?

780
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,840
You look like an anaconda from Amazon
Boss, don't trust this 'Ambassador' face

781
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I didn't marry her
She married me!

00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,960
Still I'm a virgin, boss
Don't believe her

783

'Is that something to
be proud of, you buffalo?!'

784
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Don't talk to my friends
Hang up now

I'll put you in OLX

I swear, I'm telling you the truth

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,800
We are stuck between
the devil and the deep sea

I'm scared
Crime rate is increasing

790

Let's leave her here and escape?

791

She'll go home of her own accord

794
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,400
I had my doubts from the start
You said you inquired thoroughly

795
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,080
I swear I did

796
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,440
He came clean about everything

797
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,040
He hid only this matter from me

798
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,760
If I get my hands on him-

799
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,920
You've made me kidnap a girl

800
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400

- No idea

Has a PhD in cuss words
I'm so scared

809
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,040
Talk to him?

Hello?

you'll call in 10 minutes?

Will that work?

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,960
We might as well get the ransom
than send her back for free

If only we plan this to the T
we won't get caught at all

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
What if you take
my cash and cheat me?

866
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,400
What if you cheat us by
giving wads of paper instead of notes?

867
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,560
Listen, you have just cash
We have your daughter

868
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,520
So you had better
obey my instructions

869
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,480
'Who is this moron?'

870
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,920
'I have to walk and take an auto!'

871
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,040
Auto...start
Let's go

872
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,160
- Where to?
- Ganesha temple nearby

873
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,440
Go...quick

874
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,480
He said 12 thugs will follow
Can't see a single soul

875
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,920
Here it is
Stop right here

876
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
Your fare

877
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,280
She's missing!

878
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,160
'All our problems can be solved'

879
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,600
Arrange a vehicle
without arousing any suspicion

880
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,440
We'll tell him we'll drop that girl
at 12 sharp at Vivek & Co bridge

881
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,880
We'll drop her off
at Vasanth & Co bridge, okay?

882
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,720
Don't call from your phone, very risky

883
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,600
'Beg, borrow, steal
a phone and call'

884
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,720
Super tip!

885
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,800
Hello...hello?

886
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,160
I need to recharge my phone, huh?

887
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,160
Sir, can I borrow your phone?
I need to make an urgent call

888
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,520
Thank you, sir

889
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,600
If I get hold of them-

890
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,320
Hello sir, it's me

891
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,680
- Recognize me?
- Tell me

892
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,360
If we can return your car
we'll hand over your daughter too

893
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,640
Don't worry, okay?

894
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,120
Sharp 12 midnight
Vasanth & Co bridge

895
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,480
Where...?

896
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,720
Under Vivek & Co bridge

897
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,200
- Take her back safe and sound
- Vivek & Co?

898
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,880
You take my money
and trouble me like this!

899
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,400
Okay...okay

900
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,480
Did I say Vasanth & Co
or Vivek & Co?

901
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,480
Oh God!

902
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,320
I miss my girlfriend
I've been thinking of her

903
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,000
- Don't know why
- Such a pain!

904
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,640
I intend using the car from
Jil Jil Travels for my wedding

905
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,680
Should be prompt service
Or I'll lose my cool

906
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,080
Wrong timing to plan all that

907
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,960
Open the door
I need to make a call

908
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,320
Jil Jil travels is really jinxed!

909
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,840
Only hassles hound us!

910
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,000
Wretched female!

911
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,920
You wanted me bashed up
and you took the rear entry?

912
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,440
Thinks he's Poirot or what!

913
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,840
Open the car door

914
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,520
What's your problem?
We intend taking you back home

915
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,960
Why torture us, you idiot?

916
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,080
- Watch it, she might bite you
- I told you to open the car

917
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,480
- Go...go
- I'll reverse the car

918
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,120
Come fast
Be careful

919
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,000
'You ate only lemon rice
Why are you so heavy?'

920
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,520
Is the money safe?

921
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,200
I spoke to Appadurai
He's on night duty

922
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,600
Let's drop the girl and
fling the money in his face

923
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,280
- Let's go
- Use the balance cash for your wedding

924
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,680
Sorry, I troubled you
because of my hassles

925
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,680
Imagine kidnapping a girl
just to make a fast buck

926
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,480
Okay, get into the car

927
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,200
What's up with him
all of a sudden?

928
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,760
Why are you feeling bad now?

929
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,320
As if he's a pauper! He readily shelled out
as soon as we demanded, right?

930
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,120
When we need something
we try to justify our mistakes, right?

931
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,720
Listen...there's no wrong
or right here, understand?

932
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,960
Didn't that policeman tell us?

933
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,120
'You steal, loot or resort to murder
All I need is money'

934
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,760
Where are you going?
Turn that side

935
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,160
- Where are you going?
- Following your route

936
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,560
Have you lost it?

937
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,040
Vasanth & Co bridge is that side

938
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,040
Vasanth & Co, huh?

939
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,960
You told me Vivek & Co

940
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,920
How many times I've availed
a discount with Vijay of Vivek & Co?

941
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,600
- Are you teaching me the route?
- What nonsense?

942
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,240
Even now you're wrong
That's Vasanth & Co Vijay

943
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,600
What you told me is important
or what I told him?

944
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,880
I'm sure he'll be waiting
under the bridge

945
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,000
Let's drop her
on the bridge and scoot

946
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,720
May be he would've fixed the right venue!

947
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,440
Why is the road closed?

948
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,840
Go around, we'll drop her
on the other side

949
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,680
We'll get caught for sure
if we do that

950
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,280
Safer to drop her on the bridge

951
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,520
- Bridge will be deserted
- You think so?

952
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,480
See how I push these barricades

953
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,320
Such a moron he is!

954
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,080
- Look! It's stuck
- I didn't notice

955
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,440
Hello?

956
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,400
Dai, is the cash ready or not?

957
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,000
Sir, I've arranged the cash

958
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,680
- When will you pay up?
- Today...I'll give it, sir

959
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,400
If we drop her here,
will she reach home safe?

960
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,360
She's a very smart girl

961
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,280
She missed breaking
my skull by an inch

962
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,320
Even if you take her to
North India, she'll find her way

963
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,240
Get down

964
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,000
Check if the coast is clear

965
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,200
Hey! She's missing

966
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,840
Did she run away with the cash also?

967
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,520
Hello!

968
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,800
I told you to take the roundabout way

969
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,280
Now she has absconded
Where will you look for her?

970
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,520
You are responsible for this
You didn't even tie her up securely

971
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,400
No wonder she escaped
and you blame me!

972
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,800
I'm so livid
I'll smash your face

973
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,920
Please shut up!

974
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,200
Sir, where are you?

975
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,040
I'm waiting on Vivek & Co bridge
just as you asked me to

976
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,840
'- I told you
- Did I tell him the wrong venue?'

977
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,800
Vivek & Co bridge?

978
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,280
I asked you to come
to Vasanth & Co bridge

979
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,240
Where are you now?

980
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,920
I'm waiting on Vivek & Co bridge

981
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,360
On the bridge?

982
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,960
You've got it all wrong

983
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,560
Come straight to Adyar bridge

984
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,640
Are you playing the fool?
Where is my daughter?

985
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,480
Look! They are the kidnappers

986
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,040
He's standing right here

987
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,240
Get into the car, only I know
to drive properly on the bridge

988
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,800
Go...go

989
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,960
I say, stop!

990
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,920
Speed up

991
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,280
Stop there

992
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,920
- Quick
- Nab him

993
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,400
You're dead meat!

994
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,440
Sir

995
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,600
I don't know where my daughter is

996
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,440
But they've kidnapped her
only for the cash

997
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,720
They took the ransom money
and tricked us

998
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,040
If we catch them
we can find her

999
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,200
You've lost your daughter
and you're giving reasons

1000
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,200
You can't even keep her
safe and sound at home

1001
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,920
You say she was kidnapped
so damn casually

1002
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,000
If a girl escapes do you know
what problems arise?

1003
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,840
How can I answer Mithran now?

1004
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,160
One girl escaped

1005
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,640
Another tried to escape

1006
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,120
What were you up to
from this morning?

1007
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,600
- Did you unlock the phone?
- Tried but I couldn't

1008
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,680
'I'm charging it
Tech guy is on the way'

1009
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,280
He can unlock it with ease, bro

1010
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,000
[phone rings]

1011
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,320
Hello, sir?

1012
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,960
You have my phone, sir

1013
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,240
1st gift from my fiancee, sir

1014
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,280
'I'm using it even though
it fell down in the loo'

1015
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,320
'Sentimental phone'

1016
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,880
I'll come and collect it
if you tell me your whereabouts

1017
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,360
Why are you silent?

1018
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,120
Don't think of using my phone

1019
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,920
I'll know even if you insert
another sim card

1020
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,280
It has a tracking device

1021
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,920
'You'll be in a mess
if I go to the cops'

1022
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,720
Why drag the police into this?

1023
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,480
Tell me where you are

1024
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,280
I'll give it to you in person

1025
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,360
I'll wait near Ambattur depot
Can you come and give it to me?

1026
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,120
- Hey...!
- Bro...?

1027
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,480
Send them to their hometown

1028
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:45,360
You don't go anywhere
near their house, got it?

1029
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,600
If you utter a single word to anyone-

1030
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,680
We won't

1031
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,120
'Mumbai'

1032
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,480
I clinched the deal

1033
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,480
They have advanced a huge amount

1034
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,640
Girls' height and weight

1035
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,920
I've mailed all other details

1036
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,200
Understood?

1037
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,680
From now on
let us think big

1038
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,960
If we get this right...

1039
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,760
...our lifestyle will change!

1040
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,000
Why do you worry?

1041
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,760
I'll take care of everything

1042
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,040
We will only send girls
without a background

1043
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,280
There won't be any record
to trace those girls to us

1044
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,840
I'll teach them our profession!

1045
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,920
1 minute

1046
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,280
Tell me

1047
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,440
'Are you Pari?'

1048
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,440
Yes, sir

1049
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,000
'Is this your phone?'

1050
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,480
Yes, it's my phone, sir

1051
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,120
Thank you very much, sir

1052
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,720
I'll hit yo-

1053
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,440
Are you trying to con me?
Where's my sweetheart Keerthi?

1054
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,080
Which of these guys
bargained with us?

1055
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,240
This chap

1056
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,480
Dai, how did you do all this?

1057
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,160
You look absolutely worthless

1058
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,800
Okay, you did it for money

1059
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,520
You must have some flashbacks too

1060
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,680
I'll give you 2 lakhs extra

1061
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,760
Without wasting time...

1062
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,480
...tell me where that girl is?

1063
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,280
Sir, we don't know her whereabouts

1064
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,240
Don't even know where the money is!

1065
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,040
Why ask me
what you should be asking them?

1066
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,640
In another 4 days
I'm getting married

1067
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,760
Because I'm a new groom...

1068
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,720
...even if it's a small injury, they will
stop my wedding based on sentiments!

1069
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,080
Please let go of me, sir

1070
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,920
Boss, I'll give you 10 lakhs more
than what you asked

1071
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,200
Money isn't an issue

1072
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,240
If you can unite that girl with me...

1073
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,560
...I'll build a temple for you
and pray, believe me

1074
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Hey, what's happening here?

1075
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,160
We have no clue of
that girl's whereabouts

1076
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,320
If we had known we were inviting trouble
we wouldn't have gone near her

1077
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,400
Who is she?
Why do you want her?

1078
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,160
Her parents should look for her
She cheated us

1079
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,080
I'm really bugged with her

1080
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,400
You're bugged, huh?

1081
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,760
You are mouthing my dialogs!

1082
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,800
'Thank God, I'm not
the only one to be hit!'

1083
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,240
'Where is he going?'

1084
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,040
'God help me'

1085
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,760
'He's lifting something'

1086
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,280
'He's bringing it towards me'

1087
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,440
'Somehow I should
escape their blows'

1088
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,480
'Take your time to swirl it'

1089
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,800
'My head is spinning'

1090
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,520
Lock him from the other side

1091
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,720
'Let's escape somehow!'

1092
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,560
Hey, come

1093
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,960
Run...run

1094
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,560
Go...go

1095
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,640
Run faster, boss

1096
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,160
This way

1097
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,880
- Don't leave me behind
- Hurry up

1098
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,000
Go on
Get them!

1099
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,200
Boss, don't leave me behind

1100
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,560
Take me with you, boss

1101
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,280
Hurry up

1102
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,120
Wait, let me also come in with you

1103
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,320
'Shut it down'

1104
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,000
'Just shut up!'

1105
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,280
'They are here'

1106
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,720
'Lock it
Come on'

1107
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Please take me with you, boss

1108
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,520
Boss, wait
I'm coming with you

1109
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,000
Don't leave me behind

1110
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,080
You were following me
Then where did you go?

1111
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,240
Are you safe?

1112
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,600
'I am safe but where are you?'

1113
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,200
Please find that girl soon

1114
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,760
Otherwise they will beat me to death
They are in a murderous frenzy

1115
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,320
I'm terrified, help me

1116
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,440
You targeted me

1117
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,600
'Not too late at all'

1118
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,640
'Bring her to me'

1119
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,240
And take your friend

1120
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,480
'I will forget everything'

1121
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,080
I want only her

1122
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,720
Your grace time ends
tomorrow at 12

1123
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,080
If you mess up...

1124
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,720
...I'll kill him at 12:01

1125
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,720
Next will be you
and your family

1126
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,800
There will be no sign
of any of you, mark my words

1127
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,040
Hello?

1128
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,280
Boss, please untie this rope

1129
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,680
Clear out
Don't bug me

1130
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,720
Don't know where to rub this!

1131
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,720
'Should reach me
within 2 days'

1132
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,120
Hello, is anyone here?

1133
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,760
It's so quiet here

1134
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,520
So very quiet!

1135

to call as my own'

'A time came in our lives
when we had to leave that haven'

We are forced to make way
in our Trust for many orphans like us

1145
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,360
I hope you'll understand

1146
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,360
From now on learn to face problems

Super job

1154
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,000
Whatever pros and cons you weigh
salary is 50,000 per month

1155
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,760
Company will take
the first 4 months' salary

1156

Foreign job offer?

1157

Hey! Isn't this super?

1158
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,480
You know, job security, increment

There's no towel in the restroom
That's why I came, madam

1165
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,520
Madam, do you need to buy anything?

1166
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:35,000
- Like what?
- Beer, wine, like that

1167
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,480
Hey! Get out

1168
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,080
Sir, nothing to worry

1169
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,800
Take care
I'll take leave

1170
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,760
I've locked up
his friend in the go-down

1171
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,320
Maybe you should take rest

1172
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,960
- I'll take care
- Bullshit!

1173
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,000
We are in this mess
only because you screwed up

1174
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,040
1st call that Jackie

1175
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,000
Tell him one of the girls is sick
and get grace time

1176
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,640
He'll respond asking us to
send those 4 girls first

1177
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,240
He'll say the buyer
will wriggle out

1178
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,120
Tell him only 1 girl is unwell
That too she has Dengue

1179
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,000
She won't be allowed
into the airport

1180
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,600
I'll take care of the rest

1181
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,080
He escaped from me, huh?

1182
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,160
I'll show him my true colors

1183
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,680
Where is his house?

1184
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:37,880
Hello?

1185
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,640

- Can you hear me dear?
- Tell me

1194
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,600
How long I've been wishing for this?
You've sent them finally

1195
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,280
If you had come
you would've seen God in all His glory

1196
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,120
Give me the phone, ma

1197
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,000
Hey! You glutton

Mother goes to temples
with extra vigor

1199
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,520
Why do you insist
I go with her?

1200
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,360
Is this a torture for you?

1201
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,800
Better be with amma and comply

1202
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,040
If you disobey her
I'll lose my temper

1203
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,440
You've sent your family
on a ritual yatra for my sake

1204
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,520
Please ask them to pray
for my Keerthi too

1205
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,760
We have to pray for Keerthi?

1206
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,960
Hey, who's that girl?

1207
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,560
First of all, do you know her?
Why do they want her?

1208
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,240
Boss, I'm already confused

1209
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,120
- Her house is locked
- Whaat?

1210
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,400
Why didn't you tell me
you're already married?

1211
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,760
When did I marry?
They got me married to her

1212
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,800
Nothing is lost even now
I sincerely love Keerthi

1213
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:46,400
Just say 'yes', I'll divorce
that black ape right away

1214
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,240
If she's a black monkey
you're a wild cat!

1215
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,880
Use any decent cuss word on me

1216
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,600
I'll get very tense
if you call me that

1217
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,680
You'll get tense, huh?
You deserve to be-

1218
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,440
My friend is trapped
because of you, I feel like hit-

1219
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,480
What did I do? Your friend
got caught because of you!

1220
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:02,000
Try to save him

1221
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,040
Instead of coolly
passing the buck on to me

1222
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,200
'Did I overstep my limit?'

1223
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,640
'What has caught his eye now?'

1224
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,200
Boss, ignition is on top

1225
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,480
Is he a seasoned bike thief?

1226
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,600
Reverse, boss
I'll help you

1227
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,520
- Wait, let me sit
- Get down

1228
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,320
Your mission is friendship
Mine is love

1229
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,520
- Get down, I say
- Boss, please start

1230
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,800
We are making them curious

1231
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,160
Go, 'Subramanipuram' Jai

1232
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,400
Listen, his friend is in our custody

1233
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,120
I'm sure he will come
looking for us

1234
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,760
But I can't sit here
and hatch eggs waiting

1235
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,040
She disappeared only last night

1236
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,360
She has 1 million with her

1237
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,040
Lock the house she's staying in

1238
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,440
Before she accuses me

1239
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,000
...I'll make her the 'accused'

1240
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,000
'Miss Keerthi, a student
from a charitable trust'

1241
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,880
'...misappropriated 1 million
and eloped with her lover'

1242
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,840
His entire family assisted them!

1243
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,480
People who helped orphans
bore the brunt of their disloyalty

1244
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,840
That will be apt

1245
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,440
File the case with our police friends

1246
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,240
Magnify the issue in such a way
her own friends fall for our ruse

1247
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,760
Even if she shows up
in person to save them

1248
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,120
...no one should believe her

1249
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,720
Arrange for the passports
of all the other girls

1250
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,280
Till I find her
I won't leave Chennai

1251
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,400
- Did you get it?
- Okay

1252
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,840
- Stop, let's ask him
- Show that photo

1253
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,400
This is my friend's sister
missing since last night

1254
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,760
Did any of you see her, bro?

1255
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,040
She must have come this way
wearing a blue t-shirt

1256
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,160
Blue t-shirt?

1257
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,040
'Must have been around midnight'

1258
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,320
'She travelled in my auto'

1259
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,120
- I dropped her
- Where, bro?

1260
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,560
- In the bus stop near the Pillar
- Go...hurry

1261
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,240
'Where is she going?
To Pondicherry?'

1262
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,200
'I know she doesn't drink'

1263
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,680
'Lord Shiva!'

1264
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,800
"The goat ran away
in the 'Goat and Tiger' game-play"

1265
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,160
Go sit on the floor

1266
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,840
"This sir is searching sincerely
Who knows her whereabouts surely?"

1267
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,840
"It all began with a blunder
Went haywire, one led to another"

1268
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,320
"Between the devil and deep sea
who got caught, tell me?"

1269
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:24,720
"Poor sir, poor friend indeed
More than that, the girl has to be pitied!"

1270
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:31,560
"Expiry date on dharma and justice
If it's right, what's alright as it is?"

1271
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:38,400
"Like grabbing the chameleon on the wall
Dropping it on the lap, end of story, pal"

1272
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,040
"End of story, that's all"

1273
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,280
"With castor oil in his eyes, lo!
He hunts high and low"

1274
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,600
"Whatever lead, it is a dead end
What kind of mess has she landed?"

1275
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:24,160
"You treated this issue so light
Light of your life is no longer bright"

1276
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,360
"Without sketching a plan actually
She has escaped so casually"

1277
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,160
"You're the rat, aiyo!
caught in a trap, poor you"

1278
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,320
"The villains dangle a deadline noose"

1279
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,640
- Want a peg?
- Let's go to the bar and chill?

1280
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,400
You get angry
at the drop of a hat!

1281
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:44,880
"Like petrol price escalating
his crime rate too is accelerating"

1282
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,560
"Accentuating"

1283
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,080
"The goat ran away
in the 'Goat and Tiger' game-play"

1284
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,440
"This sir is searching sincerely
who will point a finger clearly?"

1285
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,000
"It all began with a blunder
Went haywire, one led to another"

1286
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,480
Don't stay in a strange place

1287
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,880
I'll book your ticket
Leave immediately

1288
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,720
Okay, sir

1289
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,960
'Pari's house, Trichy'

1290
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,120
- Hello, ma
- Thank God, you picked my call

1291
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,760
I'm unable to reach him
He was to come yesterday

1292
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,160
- Is he with you?
- No, I'm outside now

1293
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,480
Wedding is 4 days away
He hasn't come home

1294
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,040
What can be so important?
His fiancee is very upset

1295
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,160
Why isn't he talking even to her?

1296
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,000
Got the film 'Jarugandi'?

1297
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,440
He told me he lost his phone

1298
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,360
He must be inviting his friends now

1299
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,800
He'll be there soon

1300
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,480
'Hello, are you there?'

1301
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,040
'Hello, can you hear me?'

1302
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,560
Let me talk

1303
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,680
Hello?

1304
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,400
I'll call you back

1305
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,080
Why is he staring at him?

1306
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,680
Who is he?

1307
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,640
Hey, how did you get here?

1308
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,800
Even when I opened my store,
I invited only you as chief guest

1309
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,320
But you nailed me, right?

1310
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,160
I just borrowed but you earned
extra bucks using me

1311
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,800
Tell me the truth, how are you
connected with that cop?

1312
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,840
Brother, we aren't naive
We've seen plenty like you

1313
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,840
You belong to middle class

1314
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,360
You can't stoop low
nor can you think high five!

1315
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,840
I can tell that police officer

1316
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,360
He will settle for less

1317
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,200
If need be, I can tell him
to turn a blind eye on you

1318
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,600
Let go of me, huh?

1319
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,480
I'm on the run
only because of him

1320
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,800
I'll pound you to a pulp
How do we punish him?

1321
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,480
Make him play
the Blue whale game

1322
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:03,800
50th day game over!

1323
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,400
Hey, wild cat

1324
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,040
Use any decent cuss word on me
I'll lose my cool if you call me a wild cat

1325
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,040
Brother, what are you doing?

1326
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,560
Whatever it is
we can discuss and decide

1327
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,360
Fold it well and
stuff it into his mouth

1328
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,320
He's yelling his throat hoarse, gun throat!

1329
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,120
Cool down, brother

1330
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,200
'Showing off his English'

1331
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,560
- Stuff it in
- Middle class?

1332
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,600
I don't know to stoop low
or think high-five

1333
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,120
But I know to think like a criminal!

1334
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,840
You'll be hanging in mid-air now

1335
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,480
Super, boss

1336
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,560
You committed suicide
will be the headlines

1337
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,880
If you're interrogated
the can of worms will open

1338
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,720
What is all this?

1339
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,720
- Lift him
- He can hang with the chair

1340
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,760
- Unique suicide
- Wild cat, let me speak

1341
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,280
Wait, I'll confess now

1342
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,480
See if his face is clear

1343
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,360
What do you expect of
that hand-pounder of a face

1344
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,760
Cough up the truth

1345
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,120
Inspector Appadurai is my brother, brother

1346
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,800
What does that mean?

1347
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,520
If he keeps disturbing me
I have to start all over again

1348
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,000
Bro, adding salt to the sea?

1349
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,880
Hey, keep quiet
You continue

1350
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,760
Inspector Appadurai is my brother

1351
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,200
He'll tell me all the unknown
property details in the city

1352
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,200
I'll avail loans with that information
for nameless vagabonds like you

1353
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,880
We share the spoils 50-50

1354
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:23,120
I'll share my loan details
with Appadurai

1355
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,720
Then he'll threaten them

1356
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,040
And get a commission

1357
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,360
We split that 50% each

1358
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,360
We've developed an application
for all unknown properties, brother

1359
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,120
If you leak this video...

1360
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,960
...only the online chaps will earn

1361
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,120
Let us both talk it out, brother

1362
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,920
He seems to be
a dangerous con man

1363
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,840
That's why you've tied me

1364
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,960
He's making 2 recipes
out of 1 egg!

1365
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,440
This won't work with him

1366
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,560
I'll have a peg
and bring 1 for you too

1367
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,200
He's buying booze unaware
shops are closed due to election

1368
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,920
If he's your accomplice
even a kid can fool you

1369
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,680
We bought the booze yesterday!
Will you shut up, useless?

1370
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,920
That's old stock

1371
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,320
Untie this rope

1372
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,760
Foreign booze, full bottle, brand new

1373
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,080
Let us discuss and make it
mutually beneficial, brother

1374
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,560
What you said is enough!
Full stop to your offers

1375
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,000
With this I'll find out
how to come out of my problems

1376
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,360
Brother?
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

1377
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,560
Brother, listen to me
Don't do it

1378
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,760
'Whether the top spins or not'

1379
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,040
'Whether the mangoes ripen or not'

1380
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,440
'Our lotus will always bloom'

1381
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,080
'Our lotus will always blossom'

1382
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,440
Can I see Samuel sir?

1383
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,440
He had asked me to
come here around 4:00 p.m

1384
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,560
Don't you remember me?

1385
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,720
- What...?
- Nothing

1386
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,800
Samuel himself asked you to come here?

1387
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:59,800
Yes

1388
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,640
My certificates are with him

1389
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,840
I brought the cash
he asked for

1390
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,280
My name is Keerthi

1391
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,600
Will you let him know I'm here?

1392
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,440
Okay, don't go anywhere

1393
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,600
I'm his assistant
Don't go anywhere

1394
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:16,040
Please wait here
I'll be right back

1395
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,800
Hey, tell me the truth

1396
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,480
Why has Keerthi come to see you?

1397
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,600
Is she already here?

1398
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,160
Told her to come only at 4:00 p.m
It's only 3:00 now

1399
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,160
Brother, you've recorded
my statement, right?

1400
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,320
Untie the rope

1401
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,920
I have a deal with that girl

1402
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,840
I came to Pondicherry
only in search of her

1403
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,040
She has come with cash
Her certificate is with you

1404
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,800
Tell me the truth
How did you get her certificate?

1405
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,160
If you don't blurt out the truth
I'll post your video on YouTube

1406
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,080
I'll unburden myself completely

1407
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,280
'A chap called Guna came to me
recommended by my friend Satish'

1408
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,600
'He gave original documents
of many girls...'

1409
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,680
'...and asked me to prepare
fake passports with fake addresses'

1410
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,920
'Without client coming in person
I strictly told him nothing can be done'

1411
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,520
'After a few days
he came with his clients'

1412
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,840
'He was a new client'

1413
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,200
'So I asked those girls
if they knew what's happening'

1414
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,440
'They also said yes'

1415
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,960
'I gave my visiting card
casually to those girls'

1416
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,640
Whatever it is
feel free to tell me, sir

1417
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,520
They are my wards
I'll inform them

1418
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,120
I just wished them good luck

1419
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,320
Shall I wish you too?

1420
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,840
'I thought the deal was done
but the girl who took my visiting card-'

1421
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,160
We don't need a passport
nor do we want to go abroad

1422
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,600
They are conning us
promising to get us a job

1423
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,000
Bro, please return our certificates

1424
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,520
That's our identity

1425
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,160
Am I doing social service
to return her certificates?

1426
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,200
I realized then she was penniless

1427
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,120
I made some lame excuse and dodged her

1428
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,480
Her friend is the one
who is at the door

1429
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,000
She called me 2 hours back

1430
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,400
1 million cash

1431
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,560
50% for you and 50% for me

1432
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,800
Okay with the deal?

1433
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,680
We'll return the originals to her

1434
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,920
And give fake to Guna
What do you say?

1435
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,520
Where have you kept
that girl's certificate?

1436
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,160
Will documents be in the sea?

1437
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,680
If you untie me, I'll get it

1438
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,520
Hey, what are you doing there?

1439
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,480
You can't find all that
Come here

1440
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,320
Brother...brother
I gave you the required informat-

1441
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,960
Don't take those documents

1442
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,520
Brother, please listen to me

1443
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,280
I haven't taken copies

1444
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,840
All original documents

1445
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:39,800
Hello!

1446
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,840
Untie me first

1447
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,560
Listen please

1448
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,200
If you take all the documents

1449
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,920
...how do I explain it is missing?

1450
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,000
I'll deal with them

1451
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,840
If you ever do this to anyone...

1452
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,480
...I'll close your chapter!

1453
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,080
Have you brought the cash?

1454
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,600
Yes, sir

1455
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,040
I just spoke to him on the phone
He has gone out on some work

1456
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,280
I believe your documents
are in Palavakkam office

1457
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,200
I'm going there now

1458
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,520
Why don't you come with me?
I'll give it to you

1459
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,640
If you have any problem...

1460
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,640
...give me your address
I'll courier it

1461
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,680
You'll get it in 2 or 3 weeks

1462
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,000
I'll come with you
and collect it now

1463
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,720
I have to go to Chennai as well

1464
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,720
Okay...okay

1465
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:29,720
Let's go

1466
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,880
'Trying to fool us?'

1467
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,320
'I'll hand you over to them
and rescue my friend'

1468
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,240
Get in fast
Get inside

1469
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,760
Isn't that him?

1470
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,040
Boss...boss

1471
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,400
'I got you beer, boss'

1472
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,720
'Look here, boss
I got a full case for you'

1473
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,200
'Keerthi, don't trust him'

1474
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,720
Do you want peanut candy?

1475
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,760
Oh! You don't want, huh?

1476
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,440
'Never tasted it before maybe'

1477
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,440
[Song from 'Vellai Roja']

1478
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,280
"In the Lord's house of prayer
we are candles that glow forever"

1479
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,280
"No sinners around
No differences found"

1480
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,560
Why are you so serious?

1481
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,680
After all certificate
You'll get it

1482
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,360
Sir has promised to return it

1483
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,760
Will he give all our certificates?

1484
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,440
If he has given his word
he'll do it for sure

1485
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:54,000
Not bad, you're facing
these problems all alone

1486
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,600
You are truly gutsy

1487
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,280
Are you from Chennai?

1488
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,760
Do your parents know about this?

1489
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,440
Express your feelings, only then
you can solve your problem

1490
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,920
If you think my problems
should be solved...

1491
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,560
...can you do me a favor?

1492
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,560
What is it?

1493
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,160
I'm scared to go by myself

1494
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,320
On the way can you stop
at a police station?

1495
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,960
Whaaat...?
Police station?

1496
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,920
They shouldn't go scot free

1497
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,840
Who...?

1498
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,120
Those chaps who tried to con me

1499
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,200
I meant those 2

1500
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,480
First try to extricate yourself
from this unholy mess

1501
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,680
I can handle that

1502
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,920
But I have to make sure
they are caught

1503
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,760
There is also another gang

1504
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,480
I must nab them also

1505
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,280
- One more?
- This is a duo

1506
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,880
Wanted me to fall from
the frying pan to the fire!

1507
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,960
That too they were wearing masks

1508
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,880
If their faces were covered by a mask

1509
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,560
...how will you find them?

1510
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,760
They aren't worth
losing sleep over

1511
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,080
If they mask their face...

1512
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,440
2 goons

1513
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,920
One of them was very fit

1514
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,560
Runs a travel agency
Er...called Jil Jil Travels

1515
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,800
'I intend using the car from
Jil Jil Travels for my wedding'

1516
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,880
The other chap has curly hair

1517
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,680
Such a dumbass

1518
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,800
He's getting married in 4 days

1519
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,520
I know enough details
to complain to the cops

1520
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,440
Listen, will anyone name
his travel agency 'Jil Jil'?

1521
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,120
I think they spoke deliberately
just to confuse you

1522
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,760
Don't waste time complaining
Then the cops will be confused!

1523
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,560
1st collect your certificate

1524
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,920
Go home and discuss

1525
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,160
Then you can nab both the gangs
and hand them over to cops

1526
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,240
Okay?

1527
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,760
If I had a home to go to
the way you seem to think...

1528
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,160
...why will I be on the run like this?

1529
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,160
I have to go to Hyderabad tonight

1530
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,240
But my friend is stuck with them

1531
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,720
Nowadays friendship is taken very casually

1532
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,480
But she's my childhood friend

1533
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,800
How can I abandon her?

1534
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,880
Are you from Hyderabad?

1535
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:10,360
Yes, I was brought up and
educated in a Trust in Hyderabad

1536
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,280
'We had finished our undergrad
and had to leave the Trust'

1537
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:17,360
'Trusting a consultancy company
which promised a decent job abroad'

1538
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,720
'...we came to Chennai to attend
the interview and we got selected too'

1539
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,040
Since some of you
have come from a Trust...

1540
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,200
...if you go abroad
you won't come back

1541
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,640
'You may settle down there'

1542
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,960
Visa processing will be delayed, you may
have to show a hefty bank balance too

1543
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,160
'We must give an address in Chennai
as your place of residence'

1544
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,680
Plus bank balance, we have no other go
but to create these fake documents

1545
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,480
Do you think we can trust them?

1546
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,360
That too by creating fake documents

1547
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,880
Foreign place

1548
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,280
Unfamiliar city too

1549
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,440
When we step out of our haven, any place
we go to will be unfamiliar to us

1550
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,960
After all a small change in address
So many are going already

1551
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,440
Let us also go

1552
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,280
'Promising to help us'

1553
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:07,120
'...they created a fake address as if
we are living in Chennai with our family'

1554
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,640
'We thought everything
was smooth sailing'

1555
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,800
'That was when my friend Dhanya-'

1556
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,200
Hello, Keerthi?

1557
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,520
Keerthi, where are you?

1558
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,400
I'm heading back home, why?

1559
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,880
Even if one of them is with you
don't reveal you're speaking to me

1560
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,200
There's something fishy
about this definitely

1561
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:33,200
Under the pretext of getting us jobs
they are trying to misuse us

1562
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,040
Remember Mr Samuel
we met the other day

1563
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,480
I spoke to him

1564
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,520
He just wants a small amount

1565
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,880
'I was thinking of how to escape
from their clutches, that's when-'

1566
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,280
'Terrified about my friend's safety
I went to that house'

1567
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,760
'The house was locked'

1568
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,920
'No one was in sight'

1569
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,400
They had planned this to the T

1570
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,840
Their targets are mostly orphans
like us without family support

1571
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,880
Sorry

1572
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,520
I asked only because I thought
you'll have your family to back you up

1573
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,360
Someone is calling you repeatedly

1574
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,080
Maybe an important call

1575
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,600
Take the call please

1576
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,280
1 minute please

1577
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,400
Machan, it's me

1578
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,920
Where are you calling from?

1579
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,240
Why didn't you pick my call?
Trying for so long

1580
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,200
I'm scared, they have
locked me in a go-down

1581
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,400
Have you found that girl?

1582
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,680
Don't be scared
I'll somehow make it

1583
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,920
What's the use of you com-

1584
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:31,440
Did you find her?
What were you doing so long?

1585
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,680
I found that girl

1586
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,040
She's with me now

1587
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,000
Soooper

1588
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,000
Her story is more damaging than ours

1589
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,440
I swear I won't let you down

1590
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,920
We should somehow save her too

1591
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,080
Whaaat?!

1592
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,760
You want to save her?
I'm getting married

1593
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,680
'How often I've hosted
a bachelor's party for you?'

1594
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,520
I think they are coming

1595
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,600
Will call you later, bye

1596
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,080
Delete

1597
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:18,200
"Are you a replica of me?"

1598
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:23,240
"Clock's hands will turn readily steadily"

1599
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:29,360
"The road we travel
is fragrant and floral"

1600
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,160
"With the breeze even I'll float
like a string of garland to boast"

1601
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:40,000
"I thought you were a stranger new
O' bud, my love bore fruit for you"

1602
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:44,520
"I'll stand firm as a tree
in the middle of an island care-free"

1603
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:50,320
"A bird resting at leisure
spreads her wings of love sincere"

1604
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:55,200
"Like a boat in the deep sea as a beacon
in the purple sky you're the silver moon"

1605
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:00,480
"Even the hills will be soaking wet
in the fresh showers of rain's onset"

1606
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:05,640
"To the neem tree without company
a palm will grow alongside in harmony"

1607
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:10,760
"Seeing the simmering orange sun
even the world will bloom into a garden"

1608
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:16,400
"Like wispy clouds gliding to the horizon
miseries will slide aside into oblivion"

1609
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,680
Guna sent me

1610
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,600
- Where are all the passports?
- Who is he?

1611
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:24,080
He came, took the file,
called the girl and went away

1612
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:04,560
"O' the silver star in the sky glittery
came to my porch looking for me"

1613
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:09,320
"Troubles on a marathon spree"

1614
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:14,880
"When your thirst is quenched, dear
And relaxing, taking a breather"

1615
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,880
"I came as a savior into your life
to lift your spirits, without any strife"

1616
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,440
"Let the lurking fear
in your eyes disappear"

1617
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,000
"In the tempest strong
let the gentle breeze swim along"

1618
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:30,080
"Let time merge with us now
Let this change be a constant love"

1619
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:35,160
"When one path unfolds for us anew
why does the other path block our view?"

1620
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:40,440
"When the other path is blocked completely
a new path will beckon us definitely"

1621
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:41,920
"Absolutely"

1622
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,000
"Are you a replica of me?"

1623
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,840
"Who are you, dearie?"

1624
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,640
"Are you a carbon copy of me?"

1625
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:01,400
"Who are you, tell me?"

1626
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:08,640
"Even the hills will be soaking wet
in the fresh showers of rain's onset"

1627
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,680
'Montage song is over
Pick up my damn call'

1628
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,440
If you don't answer my call
won't I get you in WhatsApp?

1629
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,920
It is some unknown number

1630
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,720
Can we stop
for a cup of coffee?

1631
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,400
From the beginning
are you working for Samuel sir?

1632
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,920
Yes, why do you ask?

1633
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,080
Nothing specific
I just asked

1634
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,520
2 minutes, I'll use
the restroom and be back

1635
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,360
Where is my phone?

1636
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:35,240
Why aren't you picking my call?

1637
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,840
Not bad, looks like
you got the girl

1638
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,120
Okay, listen

1639
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,760
That girl, certificate and passport

1640
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,360
Deliver all this safely and
then take your friend, okay?

1641
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,120
Hello...hello?

1642
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,360
Why are you silent?
Do you want your friend or not?

1643
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,800
What? Are you dreaming
he'll bring me to you?

1644
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,200
How many more people will you cheat?

1645
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:04,840
Listen, you're completely mistaken
if you think he'll hand me over to you

1646
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,480
I won't be caught by you either
But you'll get caught

1647
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,680
Everyone concerned
will get caught for sure

1648
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,760
Wait and watch
You'll know

1649
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,440
Weren't you searching for this?

1650
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,520
Where was it?

1651
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:25,520
I'm disgusted I even trusted you enough
to share my entire life's story

1652
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,320
- 1st get into the car
- Shut up

1653
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:31,280
How did you think of kidnapping me
and handing me over to them?

1654
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,920
And pretend to be a good soul!

1655
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,720
Don't talk without knowing my situation

1656
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,560
I don't need your reasons

1657
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,640
What do you want now?

1658
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,240
I escaped and your friend got caught

1659
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,960
You want to take me back
and save your friend

1660
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,360
Don't be an idiot!

1661
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,280
How long would it have taken
for me to take you directly to them?

1662
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,400
Even if I hand you over
I won't get my friend

1663
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,680
I'll take you to the police

1664
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,240
Then what? You are sailing
in the same boat as me

1665
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,680
You faked your documents
and got a passport

1666
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,400
Even if you want to surrender

1667
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:59,000
...they will grease the palms
and negate your case

1668
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,480
Trying to scare me!
What do you think of our police?

1669
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,200
Are they like Rajini in
'Moondru Mugam' or Vijay in 'Mersal'?

1670
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:07,240
Thought they are like Vijay in 'Theri'?

1671
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,680
Listen, I know who you are

1672
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:11,400
Your drama stops with me

1673
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:12,880
Don't keep trying again

1674
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,880
Just because you had our certificates
you brought me along

1675
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,920
I know how to retrieve them
and save my friend too

1676
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,040
Just watch what I'll do
to make you cry lifelong

1677
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,440
You want to save only your friend

1678
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,400
I want to put all of them behind bars

1679
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,120
Why don't you understand me?

1680
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,440
For your sake, I've been-

1681
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:39,000
'Young girl on the run
stealing 1000000'

1682
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,160
- Doctor, what happened?
- Just unconscious

1683
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,680
Start an IV drip

1684
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:30,680
You heard the doctor
Please wait outside

1685
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:38,160
"O' dream, a sliver of lightning silver"

1686
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,440
"You flashed and vanished into thin air"

1687
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:53,680
"You touched a chord in me all of a sudden
Why did you kill me with your words then?"

1688
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,960
'If I had a home to go to
the way you seem to think...'

1689
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,720
'...why will I be on the run like this?'

1690
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:04,520
"I'm all alone in solitude, ever so lonely"

1691
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,520
"I'm all by myself, a soul solitary"

1692
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:16,240
"Distance travelled too short to last
O' time traversed way too fast"

1693
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:22,400
"Dear, you gave me
a heavy load to carry"

1694
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:27,400
Sister, she was raised
in an orphanage

1695
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,160
She's in a kind of fix now

1696
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,120
Ask her to be safe

1697
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,400
Can you give this to her?

1698
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,240
Only one more drip to go

1699
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,120
She'll be discharged tonight

1700
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,920
I have to leave immediately

1701
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,760
I need to help a friend of mine

1702
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,720
When she wakes up, tell her
I'll sort out my problems by myself

1703
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,760
Please give this to her

1704
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:54,360
"Without any disguise, truly
I fell in love with you duly"

1705
01:34:54,400 --> 01:35:00,360
"Like the sun that reaches the root
to unite with you was my route"

1706
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:06,240
"Without your loving presence
my days don't make any sense"

1707
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:13,680
"I stood as a solitary tree
without you, my life is empty"

1708
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,280
How are you feeling?

1709
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,840
- Much better
- Feeling better?

1710
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,880
Who is that chap, dear?

1711
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,800
He stayed with you
and took good care of you

1712
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,840
Suddenly he gave this bag to me
and left to help out a friend of his

1713
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:39,960
Did he say anything else?

1714
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,320
He didn't say anything

1715
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,760
Lie down, take rest

1716
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,760
Why are you surprised?

1717
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,440
You administered first aid
to this girl here

1718
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,720
Sathya is her accomplice

1719
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,960
They stole 1000000
and on the run

1720
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,680
Tell us where they are

1721
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,720
You're looking for the wrong person
in the wrong place

1722
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,480
First introduce yourself

1723
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,880
Hey, make a thorough search

1724
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,640
Hello, 1st tell me who you are

1725
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,760
Who are you?

1726
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,640
Why are you entering
the ladies' toilet?

1727
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:18,960
Can't you see him?
So move aside

1728
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,120
No one inside
Stinking to high heaven

1729
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,880
Let go of me

1730
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,040
- Leave me
- What are you looking at?

1731
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,920
She is the culprit
we are looking for

1732
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,480
Where are your certificates
and passports?

1733
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:09,880
I don't have anything

1734
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,600
If you don't have
must be with him

1735
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,120
Let go of me

1736
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,720
He must have spoken to you last

1737
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:19,920
Repeat whatever I tell you

1738
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,280
He'll come definitely

1739
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,000
What are you waiting for?
Go and call him

1740
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,800
Let go

1741
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,120
Where did you go?

1742
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:12,880
Return all the passports,
certificates, cash and clear out

1743
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,480
I'll ask my boss
to release your friend

1744
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,040
We'll discuss that later

1745
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,920
1st take your hand off her

1746
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,160
Return it and scoot from here

1747
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,120
Why should I give it to you?

1748
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,320
Don't you want your friend alive?

1749
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,560
Just do as I say

1750
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,640
That's exactly what
I'm telling you too

1751
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,680
I'll find my friend and return it to them

1752
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,160
Leave this girl and clear out

1753
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:39,920
Look at that!
Sir is issuing orders!

1754
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,120
'I am repeatedly telling you
for your own good'

1755
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,960
I'm also warning you

1756
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,760
You're fishing out your weapon

1757
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,160
Finish him off

1758
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,160
Sister, where is that girl?

1759
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:03,040
She left long ago

1760
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,320
You hit me
for her sake

1761
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,480
She ditched you
and ran for her life

1762
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,920
What are you doing here?

1763
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,800
You must hide somewhere safe

1764
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:36,120
If you don't get caught
I don't have any problems

1765
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:37,880
I'll somehow save my friend

1766
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,760
I'll lie to them
you're with me

1767
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,960
Not only that
I got you into this fix

1768
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,840
Why do you think so?

1769
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,800
I can also say I escaped
thanks to your blunder!

1770
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,680
Please forgive me

1771
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,680
I misunderstood you

1772
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,680
I'm not in a position to trust anyone

1773
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,520
I don't know what is happening around me

1774
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:09,000
I'm on the 'wanted' list like a thief
hunted by the police force

1775
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:12,600
Please don't leave me in the lurch

1776
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,080
Why are you getting upset?

1777
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,400
1st stop crying
Wipe your tears

1778
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,440
I want you to be saf-

1779
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,320
Hello!

1780
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,640
Only both of us know
you are here

1781
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,200
How did they know?
That too the exact place?

1782
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:35,600
Shall we call your Trust?

1783
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:39,680
Let's say we want to donate and find out
the whereabouts of your warden?

1784
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:43,480
You are wrong if you think he is-

1785
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:48,280
I called Just Dial, got your warden's #
and told only him you're with me

1786
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,240
Wait

1787
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:51,720
I will call your Trust's landline

1788
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:57,680
Hello?

1789
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,600
We are calling from VFF

1790
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:03,000
Our boss asked us to donate
500000 to your Trust

1791
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,480
Can we meet your warden now?

1792
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,000
He's in Chennai now

1793
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,960
You can meet him only next week

1794
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,400
'Give me your contact #
I'll ask him to call you'

1795
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,800
That's okay

1796
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,760
We can come there next week

1797
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,640
Thank you

1798
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,240
- Want to save your friend?
- Yes

1799
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:20,520
Call your warden
from a phone booth here

1800
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,200
Repeat verbatim what I tell you
I'll handle the rest

1801
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:32,800
Hello?

1802
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,040
Sir, Keerthi here

1803
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:37,920
- Where are you?
- I am in the Trust

1804
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,840
I'm talking to the new admissions

1805
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:46,160
Sir, I'm so scared of
what's happening around me

1806
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,000
I've booked your train ticket

1807
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,240
Don't be flustered
We'll sort out everything

1808
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:53,080
Those thugs are all over
the place looking for me

1809
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,160
I don't even know
whom to trust

1810
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:58,080
I am scared to come alone
all the way to Hyderabad

1811
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,160
Take the next flight
and take me back, sir

1812
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,120
Please, sir

1813
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,240
Where are you now?

1814
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,280
Tell him, near T.Nagar

1815
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,600
Near T.Nagar sir

1816
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:28,960
Okay, somehow I'll be there in 3 hours

1817
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,360
Do you know Hindi Prachar Sabha?

1818
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,800
- I know
- Can you come there?

1819
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,040
Okay, sir
I'll be there

1820
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,960
Listen, she is more than enough

1821
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,120
If she comes to your Trust...

1822
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:46,200
...your name, fame, business
and network will be ruined

1823
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:48,240
Within 3 hours you'll meet her

1824
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:50,640
Bring her here and
close her chapter

1825
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:53,720
There should be no trace of her
even in your records

1826
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,680
You can't believe it, right?

1827
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,800
I just said she's alone
Take her back safe and sound

1828
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,840
But you saw your warden's true colors

1829
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,040
How do we catch them
if we go to that venue?

1830
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,640
What will we do with him?

1831
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,320
Wait and watch what unfolds

1832
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,760
Ask him to pay for the tea

1833
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,640
Pick up

1834
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:43,200
Whatever I spoke
don't hold it to heart

1835
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:46,000
Don't upload this scumbag
Samuel's video in YouTube

1836
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,920
Name the amount
I'll pay you

1837
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:49,600
We can clinch the deal

1838
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,640
I don't need your tainted money

1839
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,360
At least for 1 day
be a good cop and do as I say

1840
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,720
'Tell me what to do
I'll toe the line at once'

1841
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,760
So simple
As if I won't do this?

1842
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,160
- Will you let me off the hook then?
- Sure, it's simple

1843
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,960
But no one should know

1844
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:14,280
Even your department should not know

1845
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:15,280
Okay, bro

1846
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,600
'Be quick
Why are you fiddling with it?'

1847
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,560
'Almost done, sir
Just 2 minutes'

1848
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:34,040
'I lost my job only
because of this councilor'

1849
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,840
Hey! Who is that?

1850
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:00,520
'Stop the car'

1851
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,040
'Stop, man'

1852
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,840
Sir, aren't you Rajaram?

1853
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:33,600
- Aren't you Rajaram?
- Yes, I am

1854
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,240
From United Charitable Trust in Hyderabad?

1855
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,440
Yes, but why do you want to know?

1856
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:41,160
I was coming to meet you

1857
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:42,760
Coming?
Get in

1858
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,480
Who are you?

1859
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:46,920
Who is he?
Get him

1860
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,400
Hey, stop

1861
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:55,760
Get the car

1862
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:58,120
Who is that whizzing past us in our car?

1863
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,960
They seem to have
kidnapped your warden

1864
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,720
Are you the culprit?

1865
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:12,040
What do you think of yourself?

1866
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:13,840
Your friend is in our custody

1867
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,600
I'll show you what I can do

1868
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:17,680
You can't do a damn thing

1869
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:23,800
I have your warden, the girl you want,
certificates and Samuel's video

1870
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,520
Release my friend and those girls

1871
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,880
I'll spare you

1872
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,640
What audacity!

1873
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,200
I'll have him killed right away

1874
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:33,560
Then what?
Didn't I tell you?

1875
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,120
'You can't do a damn thing'

1876
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,520
Kill my friend
if you are so gutsy

1877
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,400
You kill him and
he'll be the happiest man

1878
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,440
He's not a lowlife to ruin
the lives of so many girls!

1879
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,120
He speaks with such temerity, Mithra

1880
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,000
Shall I kill his friend?

1881
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:55,120
And do what?
We'll go back home, huh?

1882
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:01,840
He has kidnapped the warden
with some ace up his sleeve

1883
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,800
She has also pulled a fast one

1884
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,640
I want the warden alive

1885
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,920
He's like the proverbial golden goose

1886
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:14,560
His friend is a lame duck
You want to kill him, for what joy?

1887
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:17,920
Release him

1888
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,280
- Hey!
- Sir!

1889
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:31,880
Answer truthfully
Understood?

1890
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,960
Are you really his friend?

1891
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:37,560
How can you ask me this?
We are childhood friends, sir

1892
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:40,760
This whole city claims
we even resemble each other

1893
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,480
He's my entire life

1894
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,760
- Life, huh?
- Yes, sir

1895
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,200
Do you know he wanted me
to end your life?

1896
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:52,360
Don't you dare talk ill of my friend
I'll really lose my cool then

1897
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,560
He would've never said that

1898
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,680
He wanted you dead
Want to listen?

1899
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:00,520
- Kill...me?
- You bet!

1900
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:04,120
'You can't do a damn thing'

1901
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,600
'Kill my friend
if you are so gutsy'

1902
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,800
'You kill him and
he'll be the happiest man'

1903
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:11,840
'He's not a lowlife to ruin
the lives of so many girls!'

1904
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:13,880
- Now you know
- No, sir

1905
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,920
Living in denial?

1906
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,360
Listen, you won't be alive
to see the sun rise tomorrow

1907
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,400
Sir, just once-

1908
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:25,040
Please, sir
Don't kill me, sir

1909
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,400
Explain to him, bro

1910
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:27,840
Sir...sir

1911
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:31,440
He'll anyway try to escape tonight

1912
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:32,760
Allow him to escape

1913
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,920
Let him think he got away
of his own accord

1914
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,640
He'll get in touch
with his friend for sure

1915
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:38,200
'I'll use him as the bait'

1916
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,280
Hello?

1917
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,800
I think he's peeing in his pants
Let me deal with him

1918
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,760
- What do you mean?
- I'll make him escape

1919
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,720
You won't believe me, huh?

1920
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:50,920
Junior bro
I'm petrified

1921
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,240
Somehow save me

1922
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,760
Drink water later, bro
Have mercy on me, please

1923
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,640
Junior bro, please

1924
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,880
Don't kick up a ruckus

1925
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,120
You called him your friend
and he crucified you, right?

1926
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,280
True that, bro

1927
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,960
You shouldn't trust anyone

1928
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:10,080
A chap claiming to be my good friend
ran away with my brother's wife

1929
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:13,480
You can trust anyone
But never trust your friend

1930
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:14,920
You're absolutely right, bro

1931
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:17,960
A man can get back his wife
Can I get back my life?!

1932
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:21,200
My life is in doldrums
trusting my friend

1933
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,720
You're my only hope
Please save me, bro

1934
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,000
They have sketched
a plan to kill you tonight

1935
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,560
You look like my brother

1936
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,040
Just because your friend
backstabbed you

1937
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:37,600
- I'll help you
- Thanks, bro

1938
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:40,640
If they get to know this
they will kill me

1939
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:42,800
- I won't snitch
- Understand?

1940
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:55,240
Listen, I'm all by myself here
If you escape, I'll be nailed

1941
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:57,480
The boys have gone for lunch
Be patient and wait

1942
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:00,360
I'll signal to you
when it's the right time

1943
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:05,160
Bro, give me your phone
I'll just make 1 call

1944
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:08,400
'Phone, huh?
Someone may be watching'

1945
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,920
'Hey! Stop
Don't go'

1946
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,200
I wanted to help you
and you're locking me in

1947
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,280
'How will I face them?'

1948
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:21,600
When you started helping me
you became my friend

1949
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,680
'Open the door'

1950
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,360
I don't trust you either

1951
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:42,920
"Who is he, this fiery lad ablaze?
Ask around and you'll be amazed"

1952
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,880
[Song from 'Bairavaa']

1953
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,960
- Hello!
- 'I'm Pari speaking'

1954
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:00,040
Instead of calling me
from different numbers

1955
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,200
...find a way to escape

1956
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,840
You call yourself my friend?

1957
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,720
You asked them to kill me
for some random girl

1958
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,280
Don't blabber
I was threatening them

1959
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,360
Will I let you down?

1960
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,080
I'm on the run
for your sake

1961
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:11,160
I know all the bullshit

1962
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,760
He recorded your conversation
I heard every single word

1963
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:16,600
If they shamelessly recorded
whatever I spoke to play it to you

1964
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,080
...what happened to your senses?

1965
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:20,640
I had a specific reason
Listen why I said all that

1966
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,800
Are they such scumbags?

1967
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,840
Okay, I escaped now
I'll handle them

1968
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:34,320
You escap-
How did you escape so easily?

1969
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:38,000
As my friend aren't you happy
I escaped instead of cross examining me?

1970
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:39,720
'They are a bunch of goofballs'

1971
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:42,680
One goon with a good heart
untied me taking pity on me

1972
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,160
He gave me ideas to escape

1973
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:47,000
'But I tricked him
and took his phone and ran'

1974
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:48,680
'I feel bad I took his phone'

1975
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:50,400
This sounds fishy

1976
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:51,640
'Doesn't look like you escaped'

1977
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:53,120
Looks like they let you escape!

1978
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:55,680
'Look around to see
if you can spot any of them'

1979
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:56,920
What do you mean?

1980
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,400
'Just look around'

1981
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,280
You're right

1982
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,200
They are monitoring me

1983
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:10,280
I thought as much

1984
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:13,520
They will note your every movement
What you should do now is-

1985
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:15,640
Did you call anyone else
other than me?

1986
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,320
No, I didn't cal-

1987
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,240
I tried your #
Line was busy

1988
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:21,440
I called your mother

1989
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,120
'And explained everything to her'

1990
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:24,400
She was in a temple

1991
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:26,520
She got really scared
She's on her way to meet me

1992
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,800
Are you mad or what?
Such a stupid thing to do

1993
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:29,840
What can I d-

1994
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,360
Listen to me

1995
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:34,640
If you see my mother anywhere
pretend you don't know her

1996
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,640
Okay, bye

1997
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:40,800
Auto!
Go fast, bro

1998
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,720
'Where are you going?'

1999
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,160
Stop, bro

2000
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,080
Where is my brother?

2001
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:51,280
I'll follow him
You inform Mithran

2002
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,400
- Hello?
- Ma, listen

2003
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:03,120
Please don't go to meet Pari, okay?

2004
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:04,880
What are you saying?
Where are you now?

2005
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,240
Hello, ma?

2006
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:07,400
Hello!

2007
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,880
- Why can't I hear him?
- Don't know, madam

2008
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,680
Faster, please

2009
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:19,320
- Shall I attend the call?
- Put it on speaker mode

2010
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:20,360
Hello!

2011
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:23,360
Hello
I'm in the auto

2012
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:24,960
Crossing Saidapet now

2013
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,440
Your mother is following me

2014
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,560
These thugs are tailing me too

2015
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,920
I am terrified

2016
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,360
Go to Saidapet Court

2017
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:36,040
- Why go to the court?
- Just do as I say

2018
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,800
Don't ask me silly questions

2019
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,600
Sit on the ground over there
and stage a protest

2020
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:45,400
'Close wine shops
Protest till I die'

2021
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,760
Press and media should
focus only on you

2022
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:50,200
Are you mad or what?
I can't be without drinking

2023
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:53,360
Wine shop won't be closed
just because you shout, idiot

2024
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:55,240
The police over there will arrest you

2025
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,400
'If something happens to you
the cops are to blame'

2026
01:55:58,440 --> 01:55:59,600
- Shout out boldly
- Okay

2027
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:01,680
Even the cops can't touch you!

2028
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:04,800
Okay, I'll do as you say

2029
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:16,240
'Come what may
abolish alcohol today'

2030
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:20,400
'Lock...don't stop
Shut down every wine shop'

2031
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:21,360
Get up

2032
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:22,280
Why should I get up?

2033
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,480
Doesn't a Tamilian have even this right?

2034
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,040
'Abolish alcohol'

2035
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:27,720
How many have erupted like you?

2036
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:30,760
'Till my last breath
I will protest for this cause'

2037
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,840
You shove good citizens behind bars
Then you're the anti social elements

2038
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:35,400
'Police atrocities, down down!'

2039
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:38,280
'If anything happens to me
the police force is to blame'

2040
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,240
Doesn't this look like our groom?

2041
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,160
'Police atrocities, down down!'

2042
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:46,200
He's getting married within 4 days
and he's making an ass of himself

2043
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,160
Forever snacking!

2044
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,920
I didn't like his face one bit

2045
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:52,320
I said 'no' to this alliance right then

2046
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,240
'Did anyone pay heed to my words?'

2047
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,760
Let me repeat

2048
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,320
If anything happens to me
the cops are to blame

2049
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:01,080
Are you such a humane person?

2050
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:02,320
Where is my son?

2051
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:05,160
Tell me
I'm asking you

2052
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:06,080
1 minute, sir

2053
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:07,240
Which son?
Who are you?

2054
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:08,840
I'm protesting
for the sake of society

2055
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,200
Asking me irrelevant questions!

2056
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:11,840
- Move aside
- Where is he?

2057
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:13,080
'Tell me the truth'

2058
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:14,920
'I will protest for mankind!'

2059
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,480
'Sathya isn't picking up the phone'

2060
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:20,880
He's behaving like a lunatic
All this is so puzzling

2061
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,960
- Come soon
- What shall we do now?

2062
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:33,760
- Are you Sathya's mother?
- What has happened to him?

2063
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,600
I'm his friend
Don't get flustered

2064
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,720
- Will you get down?
- Your son spoke to me

2065
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:40,080
He's in some fix
That's why Pari behaved so weirdly

2066
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:42,320
1st let's leave this place, trust me

2067
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,560
Hey! Get the car

2068
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:52,040
I don't know who they are
But I'm driving now, we are safe

2069
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,200
Don't stop anywhere
Follow my instructions

2070
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:56,080
- I'll meet you soon
- Okay, bro

2071
01:57:56,120 --> 01:58:00,000
Mithra, I've spotted his family
I am following them

2072
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,960
Drive my mother and sister
to a safer place right now

2073
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:45,960
What do you mean?

2074
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:47,360
'How can we leave you and go?'

2075
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:48,880
Just go, don't argue

2076
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:31,120
My fault

2077
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,280
I should have killed you right then

2078
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:35,240
Even now narrow escape

2079
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:38,800
If you hadn't turned up
I would have wiped out your family

2080
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:41,720
Even if you target us
we might run in fear

2081
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:44,560
But if you think of harming my family-

2082
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:46,040
What will you do?

2083
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:48,560
Hey!

2084
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:11,240
I told you just now

2085
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:14,400
I won't spare any of you
if you try to harm my family

2086
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:15,880
Come on

2087
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:29,480
What did you say?

2088
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:31,200
She's part of your family, huh?

2089
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,760
If I kill her
what can you do?

2090
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:48,560
I thought I was a clever crook
you seem to beat me hollow

2091
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:50,720
I'll upload this video soon

2092
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,000
Our people will forgive any crime

2093
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:56,240
But they will never forgive
abuse of women and children

2094
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:58,040
Spend your last years in prison

2095
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:00,680
If you think you can use
your clout and get out-

2096
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:04,520
'A gang kidnapping destitute girls without
family backing wanting to secure jobs abroad'

2097
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:07,000
'...has been nabbed in Chennai
by our police task force today'

2098
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:09,080
'Many girls in their custody
have been rescued'

2099
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:13,240
'Many of the culprits involved from Mumbai
and Bangalore have been arrested'

2100
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:15,880
'A trust in Hyderabad is also
part of this whole scam'

2101
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,080
'Since the owner of the Trust
has turned approver'

2102
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:22,320
'...the police force believes
the other girls will be rescued too'

2103
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,760
In all my years of service

2104
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:44,760
...this is my 1st bullet shot

2105
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:47,720
You shared your location
and coolly asked me to come here

2106
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:50,560
Thank God some chap came to
complain about his missing girlfriend

2107
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:52,040
I came with his help

2108
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:54,880
Kindly don't forget
to delete that video

2109
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,880
Forget such an incident took place

2110
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:58,040
Sir, thanks for coming

2111
02:04:58,120 --> 02:04:59,320
Why thank me?

2112
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:01,200
Convey your thanks to him!

2113
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:03,240
Hello?

2114
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:11,280
Brother, what are you doing here?

2115
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:13,000
Idiotic fellow!

2116
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:17,240
This is Mr Gajendran I told you about
who loves you with all his heart

2117
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:18,720
It's me
Come, da

2118
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:20,480
- This man?
- Yes

2119
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,480
'She's planning to snitch on me'

2120
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,440
How many Missing cases in 1 day?

2121
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:27,600
WhatsApp in the group
I'll take a look

2122
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,400
Come here

2123
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:34,200
- Me?
- Get down

2124
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:36,360
He's showing too much concern

2125
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:38,560
What, uncle?
Ooops! 'Uncle' just slipped out

2126
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:41,080
'Don't know how many
years of bottled revenge!'

2127
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,360
What's your name?

2128
02:05:42,440 --> 02:05:44,080
Even a new born baby will tell my name

2129
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:45,520
How can a new born speak?

2130
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:48,360
My name is Gaja
Worldwide famous, sir

2131
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:51,920
Your wife is complaining
her husband is missing

2132
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,880
You're complaining of a missing girlfriend

2133
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:55,400
Are you taking a dig at us?

2134
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:56,360
Not like that, sir

2135
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,480
I am a man of bulk
My wife is a hulk

2136
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:00,840
In between thought I'll get a 'silku'

2137
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:03,440
I'm being serious
Is this some comedy role?

2138
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:05,640
My comedy comes out
on a serious note, sir

2139
