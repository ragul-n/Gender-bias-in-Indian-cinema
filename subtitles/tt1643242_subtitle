What a girl she is.

40
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:27,651
Yes these girls are good
for enjoyment but not for love.

41
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:30,154
What are you talking? You will
speak anything about any girl..

42
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,123

You have become mad now.

..prostitution to
their own daughters.

00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:02,515
How any one can do
this with own children.

53
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:11,389
This is their old business. They
have never thought about the work.

54
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:15,493
This was easy method to earn
the money and they are dong it.

55
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,233
Any way leave it
and let us go home.

They're is nothing to worry.

..that they are living
in the country of the Gandhi ji.

85
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,164
Nothing is going

Mangi take this. My work is over.

You're strange. lf my work is done,

00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:49,423
Great!

131

Greeting, sir.

133
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:06,416
Do the massage properly. He would
have done hard work in the night.

134
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,213
Sir, isn't it fun today?

135
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:14,219
While bringing the girl
you just use your eyes.

136
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,591
Always bringing the
girl of your shape.

137
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:17,720
Excuse me sir...

138
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:20,823

l don't mean that.
- You are joking to me.

140
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,602
No no l am joking.

141
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:28,197
ln fact it takes time to
find out the girl of your choice..

142
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:30,542
..and you are always in hurry.

143
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,176
O.K. l am giving you time.

144
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,674
l will give you time of one week..

145
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:39,682
..and remember this time if you
bring any other girl on my head..

146
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,811
..then l will leave that
girl and make you only naked..

147
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:44,481
..sir what are you talking. - l'll
leave you in the stable of horses.

148
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:48,189
Lalu when the girls are going.
- Tomorrow.

149
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:51,925
You are sending that girl
foreign who is earning for you.

150
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:55,361
We are doing all these for us.

151
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:57,834
Now there is so much costly life.

152
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,734
And her sister is
alone in the house..

153
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,131
..and her age is also increasing.

154
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,676
Now the customers are also reduced.

155
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:05,733
Phoolwa..

156
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:07,671
Lalu is correct and..

157
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,276
..that is why we are sending
foreign to six years old girl.

158
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,612
Lalu one thing you tell me.

159
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:15,447
These foreigners are taking
the small girls to foreign..

160
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:18,784
..and giving so much money
but what they are doing with them.

161
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:24,293
l heard that foreign movies
in the name of child sex are made.

162
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,092
Very famous!

163
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:29,396
l also heard that
these foreigners..

164
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:32,160
..are giving costly
injections to the girls..

165
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,500
..and make them complete young.

166
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:34,561
Yes.

167
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:36,802
l have never seen on the T.V.

168
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,400
Well Lalu tell me one thing..

169
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:43,443
..that these foreigners are not
giving much trouble to our girls.

170
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:48,317
No in this matter the English
people are trust worthy.

171
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:52,381
After four five years they
comes and talk face to face.

172
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,625
lf you don't want the girl
then they give good price..

173
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:59,286
..and if you want
then they return them.

174
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:06,398

390
00:31:16,388 --> 00:31:21,325

There is a girl. Lajo.

392
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:25,253
She's a daughter of a village head.

My father said..

395
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,631

396
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:34,669
Mangi all that is O.K.
but where we are going?

397
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,433
We are going to the same
place where you want to go.

398
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:40,303
To Bela.

399
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,346
Uncle Mangat.

400
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:46,272
Uncle.

401
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,446

Mangi.

407
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:06,827
Did you come to cast
evil eyes on my daughter?

What are you talking.

409
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,171
Leave it now.

410
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:14,611
A butcher looks at a goat..

411
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,740
..and a pimp at a girl
with an eye for business.

412
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,383
Now you've no daughter or sister..

413
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:30,894
..so you're always thinking
of selling girls of others.

414
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:35,165
Aunty you are
misunderstanding to me.

415
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:36,860
l'm not so lowly.

416
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,273
Mangi you.

417
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:47,709
Bela, aunt lectured me for you.

418
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:49,643
Why you came here.

419
00:32:49,714 --> 00:32:52,774
ln fact one boy wanted to meet you.

420
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,718
Mangi you become mad.
How l can meet him.

421
00:32:58,223 --> 00:32:59,588
You talk to the father.

422
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:02,786
He will not talk about the
business but want to meet you.

423
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:06,859
He's a nice boy. Come here. Come.

424
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:23,373
Bela ji since when l had
seen you wanted to meet you.

425
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:25,238
Why?

426
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,439
Because..

427
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:34,921
Because you are looking
veyu nice to me.

428
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:41,490
Mangi had not told you that l have
not so far started the business.

429
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,935
See you are misunderstanding me.

430
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,506
Not l am but people
will misunderstood.

431
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:53,436
But..
- Bela!

432
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,268
Bela!

433
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:56,778
Bela.

434
00:33:56,848 --> 00:34:01,182
Aunty has called her. This
is what l don't like about her.

435
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,211
You please do one thing for me.

436
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:07,087
Just now you were
talking about love.

437
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:08,884
He gets dumb struck
on seeing the girl.

438
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:10,656
Forgive me.

439
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:12,452
But..

440
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:33,446
l told you that
the boy is very good.

441
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:39,819
Yes the boy is good but
he was talking like mads.

442
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:42,852
l don't understand
what he was saying.

443
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:47,287
The day on which you will understand
you will also become mad for him.

444
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:53,636
lt seems that boy has
given you much money and..

445
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:55,568
..that is why you
are appreciating him.

446
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,667
Aunty so many people
have given money and mind..

447
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,876
..but today l will also
purchase gift for my Lajo.

448
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:05,109
Do what you want.

449
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:13,349
Yes see there is my Lajo.

450
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:15,826
You stay here. Lajo.

451
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:17,259
Yes.
- Stop.

452
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,418
Bye.

453
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:21,496
How are you?

454
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:23,361
l am fine..

455
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:26,097
..but what is the matter. Today
you started business so early.

456
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:29,663
l have to do business quickly
as l have to do marriage with you.

457
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:34,303
Ohoo, What is the matter?
You're talking like crazy.

458
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:35,368
Yes.

459
00:35:35,814 --> 00:35:40,251
Who is that boy with you.
He was looking so cute.

460
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:45,583
Yes and he is rich also
but he is little bit mad.

461
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:47,786
What happen?

462
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,455
He is behind Bela.

463
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:54,654
But so far she had
not started business.

464
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:57,223
l am telling the same thing.
But he is not ready to listen.

465
00:35:57,702 --> 00:36:01,502
Mangi you do one thing.
You talk to him for me.

466
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:03,773
What?

467
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:07,175
Yes you talk with dad for me.
- Shut up.

468
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:08,734
So smart.

469
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:11,875
lf you will give all the enjoyment
to customer then what will be for me.

470
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:14,444
Go home.
- You get lost.

471
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:29,197
Mangi what is the matter.
What happen. - Nothing.

472
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:32,628
Forget it.

473
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:34,498
Have you seen to my Lajo.
- Yes.

474
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:35,561
How is she?

475
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,676
She's very nice.But Mangi,
Lajo is not yours.

476
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:44,509
Now.. actually everyone..

477
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:47,650
Now.. who ever gives money..
Lajo will..

478
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,913
lt's not so, sir.

479
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:54,721
Mangi, this is the custom
of your village. Right?

480
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:19,483
Chanda take meal.

481
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:23,581
l don't want.
- Eat it.

482
00:37:24,522 --> 00:37:27,286
Your problem will not
be solved by quitting the meal.

483
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:33,156
Definitely it will be. The problem
of this house will be solved.

484
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:34,893
Well how is it?

485
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:37,427
By my death.

486
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:40,194
Chanda have you become mad.

487
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:47,169
l become mad only on that
day when l have seen my figure.

488
00:37:50,481 --> 00:37:55,418
Chanda the beauty of
the woman is not everything.

489
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:58,582
Even his heart..
- No bhabhi..

490
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:02,051
..in this market of flesh
the ugliness and old age is...

491
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:05,157
..worst than death.

492
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,728
You have always thought
about my good ness.

493
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:14,767
Then please bring
some poison for me.

494
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:18,639
l can't bear it anymore.

495
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:22,713
This ugliness hasn't spared me.
- Chanda.

496
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:25,407
Bhabhi let me die.

497
00:38:26,484 --> 00:38:28,452
No, Chanda.
- Let me die.

498
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:30,086
Everything will be fine.

499
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:31,547
Chanda..

500
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:38,328
See he is coming.

501
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,524
He can not do anything in his life.

502
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,834
You fool!

503
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,800
What did you do in life? Huh?

504
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:58,678
You've only lived on your
women's earning. Nothing else.

505
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,514
You too do the same.
You're a pimp too.

506
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:03,178
Hey you..

507
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:05,847
l used to do it.

508
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,386
Stupid!

509
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:11,554
Lower your gaze.

510
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:14,428
Lower your gaze.

511
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,269
He has said enough.

512
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:22,528
Yes.

513
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:25,302
He'll die one day.

514
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:32,115
Mangat,
l think you forgot business.

515
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:36,216
Do you know my name is Mufatlal.

516
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:39,449
l'm Mufatlal (Free) only by name.

517
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:43,093
l won't even perform my
father's last rites for free.

518
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:48,655
So how can l let you do
business of one lakh for free.

519
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:52,364
You've come on the track.

520
00:39:53,905 --> 00:39:56,738
l'll give you your share.

521
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:02,470
But will you get me tip too.

522
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:07,710
The girl whose clothes
my Landlord removes..

523
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:11,151
..he covers her body
with so much money and gifts..

524
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:15,315
..that the girl forgets
to wear the clothes. Got it?

525
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:17,450
Take this.

526
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,756
This is 25,000 advance.

527
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:22,922
Stop.

528
00:40:24,502 --> 00:40:28,404
Before taking the money,

00:54:23,473 --> 00:54:25,202
This is a dirty system.

707
00:54:25,408 --> 00:54:30,710
l'm ashamed of your
custom and tradition.

708
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,838
Hey.. boy.

709
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:34,344
You should have shame..

710
00:54:34,584 --> 00:54:36,677
..that you are misguiding the
innocent girls of the village.

711
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:40,086
Hey.. if you have so
much mad in young age

712
00:54:40,156 --> 00:54:42,124
...then go to her
girls of the village.

713
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:44,626
They will make you
cool in two days.

714
00:54:44,694 --> 00:54:51,793
Shut up and l will
change this system.

715
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:53,224
Beat him.

716
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,204
Stop. Get away.

717
00:54:57,507 --> 00:55:00,271
No one will touch him here.

718
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:04,172
Now this matter will be decided
in the panchayat of the village.

719
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:28,336
l love to the Rahul and l
will do marriage with him only.

720
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:31,033
You have some shame or not.

721
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:35,444
Being a girl you are
talking about your marriage.

722
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:40,349
Your father sired you. Raised you.

723
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:44,487
Now if you don't earn money
for him, you'll be sinned.

724
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:47,385
You people are doing sin.

725
00:55:47,657 --> 00:55:49,488
You are doing business
for the daughters..

726
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:53,354
..and daughter- in- laws
asking them to sit in the house.

727
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,590
Shut up.

728
00:55:55,365 --> 00:55:57,526
Mangat, explain to your daughter.

729
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:01,602
lf she's getting too smart,
we'll teach her a lesson first.

730
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:07,339
You beg to pardon and come home.

731
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:09,471
Or else it'll be very bad.

732
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:12,545
You'll die too with this scum.

733
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:14,641
Till l am alive no one
can touch to the Bela.

734
00:56:15,885 --> 00:56:18,615
We loved to each other.
- He is speaking false.

735
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:21,385
Then it is also false.

736
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:27,228
l will not leave you alive.

737
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,488
Mangat!

738
00:56:33,536 --> 00:56:34,560
No Mangat..

739
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,598
..now the Panchayat will give the
punishment to your daughter & not you.

740
00:56:42,145 --> 00:56:45,080
This is the question of
the honour of Bedia society.

741
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:48,777
You know the consequence of this.

742
00:56:50,053 --> 00:56:52,385
Ask for pardon.

743
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:54,082
l will not beg pardon.

744
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:57,718
Mukhia ji l beg to pardon to my
daughter on behalf of my daughter.

745
00:56:58,795 --> 00:57:01,229
You know that she is innocent.

746
00:57:01,297 --> 00:57:04,858
Forgive her.
l apologize to you, chief.

747
00:57:05,301 --> 00:57:07,633
No Mangat

748
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:12,598
No Mangat..

749
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:16,111
..now she is not your
daughter because..

750
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:20,611
..she is speaking the
language of this boy.

751
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:23,751
Brothers.
- Yes, chief.

752
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:28,189
Now this girl has
insulted to all of us.

753
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:30,518
lt is necessary to
give punishment to them.

754
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:33,628
Or else girls of our house
too will become like them.

755
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:38,597
This is the opinion of
the panchayat to kill them.

756
00:57:40,704 --> 00:57:42,365
Stop.
- No!

757
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:45,407
No! Don't hit him.

758
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:47,066
Leave him. No..

759
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,336
Hey..
- No.

760
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:50,136
Father, save him.

761
00:57:51,147 --> 00:57:52,205
No!

762
00:57:53,249 --> 00:57:54,079
Rahul!

763
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,050
No! No!
- Leave..

764
00:57:56,286 --> 00:57:58,117
No! Father!

765
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:00,179
No! No!

766
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:02,188
Get that scum!

767
00:58:06,062 --> 00:58:07,051

768
00:58:07,864 --> 00:58:10,799
No! No..
- Leave me!

769
00:58:19,342 --> 00:58:20,331
Beware.

770
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:33,552
lf anyone steps forward then l will
make this village as crematorium.

771
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:42,529
Boy we the villagers
also know to use the guns.

772
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,225
Who are you that you
are speaking so much.

773
00:58:46,503 --> 00:58:48,562
Thakur Amar Singh.
- Which Thakur amar Singh.

774
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:50,801
The son of Thakur Ranjit Singh.

775
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:53,572
Then what you will do.

776
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:56,610
You will finish our tradition.

777
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:57,668
Hey, Lalo.

778
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:00,707

with your tradition.

779
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:05,448
But he is my friend and guest.

780
00:59:07,557 --> 00:59:09,457
You leave them peacefully.

781
00:59:10,093 --> 00:59:11,082
Or else..

782
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:17,189
Thakur..

783
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:26,800
..if you say then we will leave
him but you make him understand.

784
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:34,515
Forget our girls, you won't
even look at our village now.

785
00:59:34,617 --> 00:59:37,484
Muklhia l am not going to
fear with your threatening.

786
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:42,285

Junior landlord, tell your
friend to leave the girls hands..

..or else we'll fulfil your wish.

792

You'll kill the villagers..

793
00:59:56,773 --> 01:00:00,209

Don't leave me.

No there is a opinion.
- Tell me.

01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:57,360
Now you should leave
this habit of the women.

812
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,601
What are you saying?
- The truth.

813
01:01:01,571 --> 01:01:05,530
These pictures were
found under your pillows.

814
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:09,368
We women of royal family
don't say anything..

815
01:01:09,445 --> 01:01:12,539
..it doesn't mean we
don't know anything.

816
01:01:13,783 --> 01:01:18,720
But now the time has come for
you to quit your frivolous acts.

817
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:23,485
How is it possible? We
get this habit in heritage.

818
01:01:23,793 --> 01:01:27,422
lt's a part of our royal
pride. How can we leave it?

819
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:30,631
Fine. You can do what you want.

820
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:35,226
But your evil deeds
shouldn't affect my kids.

821
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:37,869
Or else l'll be severe.

822
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:45,774
Amar, stop the car.

823
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,549
Stop the bloody car.

824
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:54,585
O.K. if you are so much fond
of to die in the name of love..

..then you go and l will
not stop you. What you say.

826
01:01:58,127 --> 01:02:00,322
The man with whom the deal
of Bela has been finalized..

827
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:05,562
..is no one else but your
father Thakur Ranjit Singh.

828
01:02:05,868 --> 01:02:06,857

You bastard came out to protect
against the decision of the panchayat.

833
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:39,357
No!

834
01:02:39,535 --> 01:02:40,524
You..

835
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,159
Aunty.

836

You have so much proud.

837
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:53,706
The girls of this village are daily
being crushed in this dirty system.

838
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:58,548
They are fulfilling the
livelihood of their family..

839
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:03,155
..but in lieu there of
the men of this village..

01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,505
She has insulted
me in the community.

845
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:25,247
She won't do anything.
- l will kill her.

846
01:03:25,515 --> 01:03:27,574
l'll talk to her.
- You tell her to forget that boy..

847
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,515
..otherwise no one will
be made for her than me.

848
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:31,280
l could never forget him.

849
01:03:31,454 --> 01:03:37,450
Listen the talk of this shameless
girl. l will make her proper.

850
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:42,426
Look.. look at your
girl. - O.K. - Now you go.

851
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:44,292
What you did.

852
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:46,559
Leave it. You don't
know your father's anger.

853
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:47,725
Come.

854
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:52,704
You forget him otherwise
we will be destroyed.

855
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:56,074
You go away
- What are you doing?

856
01:03:56,612 --> 01:03:59,308
You tell for the last time that
you will forget that boy or not.

857
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:01,244
She become mad and did mistake.

858
01:04:01,317 --> 01:04:04,377
lt is far away to forget him
now he will remember me badly.

859
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,351
What are you telling. Leave her.

860
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:08,684
Ah.. leave my child.

861
01:04:09,859 --> 01:04:11,827

You can eliminate the
name written on the hand..

01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:29,440
but can not eliminate the name of
Rahul which is written on my heart.

866
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:34,147
l will eliminate him
also. l will kill you.

867
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,439
Leave her.

868
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:40,486
l'll kill her. Tell her.

869
01:04:41,324 --> 01:04:42,313
Child.

870
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,757
Go to hell with that Rahul..

871
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:51,133
..who has made such a
condition of my daughter.

872
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:07,538
Mangi.

873
01:05:13,689 --> 01:05:14,883
What are you thinking.

874
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,325
Now what is there to think sir.

Mangi myself and Bela

01:05:32,175 --> 01:05:33,665
..and ca not accept
defeat so easily.

879
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:40,378
My father is a big officer in the
city & l am going to take his help.

880
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:46,112
l will use my full power

881
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:49,656
You just take care of my Bela.

882
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:56,255
l am going.

883
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:08,139
By using force the
love is not ended.

884
01:06:08,878 --> 01:06:12,507
You keep quiet. This love
will become enemy of your life.

885
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,751
The love can not
be enemy to any one.

886
01:06:18,754 --> 01:06:25,683
But love is live
and Rahul is my life.

887
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,289
Now Rahul will
never come here Bela.

888
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:32,825
You understand it. He will
no the allowed to come here..

889
01:06:33,402 --> 01:06:35,267
..and if he came then
he will be killed.

890
01:06:36,772 --> 01:06:40,071
You know know that Bedia
people are very dangerous.

891
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,305
Rahul will definitely come.

892
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:45,207
He loves me very much.

893
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:49,381
He'll surely get me
out of this quagmire.

894
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,381
And if.. he dies
in this endeavour..

895
01:06:56,759 --> 01:06:58,556
l'll die too.

896
01:06:58,828 --> 01:07:02,525
Don't become mad. You can
not die with the man dying.

897
01:07:06,168 --> 01:07:09,433
You listen to me and
join the business.

898
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:13,399
Just think..

899
01:07:14,143 --> 01:07:17,078

901

Bela. Listen to me.

902
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:37,230
Forget this love.

903
01:07:39,735 --> 01:07:42,602
lt has given nothing to anyone.

904
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:49,200
Mummy have you loved to any one?

905
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:55,179
You and Rahul both will be killed.

906
01:07:59,555 --> 01:08:03,184
Mummy have you loved to any one?

01:08:17,273 --> 01:08:19,366
Mummy have you loved to any one?

914
01:08:34,323 --> 01:08:36,291
We both loves to each other
and wanted to do marriage.

915
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:39,519
This is our crime.
- Yes this is crime and also sin.

916
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:43,060
Today because of you the girl
of bedia has broken her religion.

917
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:47,331
The girl's duty is to
earn for her family.

918
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:50,405
That is why you will be punished.

919
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:53,402
Mukhia ji you forgive
to my daughter..

920
01:08:54,043 --> 01:08:55,806
..otherwise my children
will die in starvation.

921

O.K. as you say we will
forgive to your daughter..

922
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:03,315
..but set fire to this boy alive.

No please don't do this.

924
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:09,148
Please don't do anything.
- You leave here and tell you daughter.

01:09:09,592 --> 01:09:12,755
Leave me.
- We will go to leave the village.

926

No!

933
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:03,176
After that l was compelled
to join the business.

934
01:10:05,714 --> 01:10:07,238
Mummy your love was immature.

935
01:10:10,519 --> 01:10:15,582
l don't know whether my
love was immature or my luck.

936
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,752
Why you are cursing to you luck.

937
01:10:21,297 --> 01:10:22,491
You don't have courage.

938
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:27,259
lf l would be in your place..

939
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:31,539
..then l would have given
my life with my friend.

940
01:10:36,879 --> 01:10:39,473
Atleast l would not have

01:10:51,327 --> 01:10:52,692
You will not get anything.

944
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:58,164
No mummy l got everything in
love which was l was to get.

945
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:02,600
Now this is the time of sacrifice.

946
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:12,145
Let's see what is
there for me in love.

947
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:18,716

There will be line of
girls in your house also.

No the girls are not in my luck.

972
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:50,635
You go and purchase a
girl from other village.

973
01:12:52,147 --> 01:12:56,083
No uncle in this time no one
will sale his girl to any one.

974
01:12:56,585 --> 01:12:58,382
You won't sell!

975
01:13:00,723 --> 01:13:02,350
You act smart in the village.

976
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:04,759
Do you even know what's
happening in the world?

977
01:13:06,562 --> 01:13:09,122
There are some villages
in the our country..

978
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:11,129
..where there is
no dearth of fools.

979

ln this country there
are so many villages..

980
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:15,428
..where still people think
as burden to the girls.

981
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:19,469
This is like the saying,
a blind man knows no color.

982
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:24,274
l heard that they used to kill
the girls after taking birth.

Mukhiaji what are you telling.
- l am telling you truth.

984
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:32,384
And those who have got the girls
are selling them in low prices also.

985
01:13:34,256 --> 01:13:36,053
Lalu don't be sad.

986
01:13:36,258 --> 01:13:38,852
You take the address of that village
from the Mukhia kaka. - Lalu uncle.

01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:40,191
What happen?

988
01:13:40,262 --> 01:13:42,526

01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:46,400
Now l have to settle the
account of this old lady also.

01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:47,524
Come on.

991
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:58,301
Stop.

992
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:01,476
You want to keep alive by giving
medicines to this old lady.

993
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:05,319
You want to incurve the
money of this house of her.

Hey.. shut up.

01:14:11,126 --> 01:14:17,292
She needs the poison and not

997
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:19,297
Brother. - Keep
quite. - Brother..

998
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:21,902

01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:27,374
No.. no..

Lalu what is this?

1007
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:02,535
You atleast used some
mind while doing any work.

1008
01:15:03,645 --> 01:15:07,809
No mukhia uncle l have
tolerated so much and not now.

1009
01:15:08,283 --> 01:15:10,376
You should wait for today.

1010
01:15:11,286 --> 01:15:13,379
You know there is
happiness in the village..

1011
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:15,716
..and you created a new problem.

1012
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:17,449
This is not correct.

1013
01:15:19,762 --> 01:15:21,491
Now what are you thinking.

1014
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:26,129
You go and make preparation
of her cremation.

1015
01:15:28,771 --> 01:15:29,703
Fulwa.

01:15:29,772 --> 01:15:33,765
Murari you take the villagers with
you and do the cremation properly.

Yes.

1018

Come on.

1019
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,672
Think before you act.

1020
01:15:43,318 --> 01:15:44,307
Come on.

1021
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:46,821
What happened to grandma.

1022
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:55,556
There was a good atmosphere
but he has spoiled everything.

1023
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:57,455
He ruined it!

1024
01:15:57,566 --> 01:16:00,194
Old lady, move, Let us go now.

1025
01:16:00,335 --> 01:16:03,429
Get aside. Take her.
- Hey, move.

1026
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:05,172
Move!
- No!

1027

Still she is alive and

She will die on the way. Take her.

1029

Lift her.

1030
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,251

01:16:48,684 --> 01:16:52,085
Why after all what you want to do.

Now l want to do marriage
with you and settle the house.

01:17:00,696 --> 01:17:02,857
l will do some other
work in the city.

1036
01:17:04,766 --> 01:17:07,530
That boy has changed
you completely.

1037
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:11,629
You have also been changed.

1038
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:16,272
You don't come in the word of
that boy Mangi and do your work.

1039
01:17:17,813 --> 01:17:20,748
No matter how it is that
we're born in this village.

1040
01:17:22,317 --> 01:17:25,775
We have to live and die
in this situation only.

1041
01:17:27,823 --> 01:17:30,621
Lajo is it not possible for us
to go and leave this village.

1042
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,182
Mangi don't become mad.

Hey.. Mangi, you?

No there is nothing like that.

Now you don't show
the false dreams to us.

1051
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:11,666
We will live in this
situation but you save Bela.

1052
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:16,536
Since when her deal has been
finalized with Thakur Ranjit Singh..

01:18:18,573 --> 01:18:22,202
..she has left the eating

No mangi you don't talk like this.

01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:21,795
How can l live without you?

1063
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:25,870
How can l live without you?

1064
01:19:27,442 --> 01:19:31,674
How can l live without you?

1065
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:36,376
How can l live without you?

1066
01:19:37,452 --> 01:19:42,788
How can l live without you?

1067
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:53,463
Your words, your breath..

1068
01:19:53,568 --> 01:19:57,732
How can l live without you?

1069
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,599
How can l live without you?

1070
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:05,339
How can l live without you?

1071
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:23,456
You go from here.

1072
01:20:24,098 --> 01:20:25,759
Aunty what is the matter tell me.

1073
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,228
You have destroyed the
life of my daughter..

1074
01:20:29,504 --> 01:20:31,165
..and now asking
what is the matter.

1075
01:20:31,506 --> 01:20:35,033
You only brought Rahul
to meet my daughter.

1076
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:40,613
Then what s bad in this. This is
good to do the marriage of daughter.

1077
01:20:40,781 --> 01:20:43,579
Then why you are no telling
this to the men of village.

1078
01:20:43,751 --> 01:20:45,582
Why are you after my child's life?

1079
01:20:47,121 --> 01:20:49,021
What to tell the men aunty..

1080
01:20:50,057 --> 01:20:52,321
..when the women are ready
to sale their daughters.

1081
01:20:52,693 --> 01:20:53,751
Then what l do.

1082
01:20:54,362 --> 01:20:56,796
l tell her dad that she
will not do the business..

1083
01:20:57,765 --> 01:21:00,063
..and leave her alone to die.

1084
01:21:00,134 --> 01:21:04,696
Throw her in fire. This is better
to die once instead of dying daily.

1085
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,199
Atleast the life of other
girls will be saved..

1086
01:21:10,077 --> 01:21:11,738
..and this tradition
will be finished.

1087
01:21:12,547 --> 01:21:15,175
So many girls have died..

1088
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:19,513
..and the blood spot of so many
girls are still there ln the village..

1089
01:21:21,622 --> 01:21:25,058
..and you are telling that by giving
life the system will be finished.

1090
01:21:26,761 --> 01:21:31,562
They have not given life but
their lives have been taken.

1091
01:21:35,102 --> 01:21:41,701
lf we have to finish this system
then we have to give our lives.

1092
01:22:00,595 --> 01:22:01,584
Sister-in-law.

1093
01:22:03,364 --> 01:22:04,991
Sister-in-law.
- Coming.

1094
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:08,666
Come on Bela is ready now.

1095
01:22:10,137 --> 01:22:11,399
Chanda what is the matter.

1096
01:22:12,506 --> 01:22:15,771
Bhabhi l can not see the
condition of the Bela.

1097
01:22:17,745 --> 01:22:22,114
l think that now she has to
live like us in this hell.

1098
01:22:24,452 --> 01:22:25,783
What she can do.

1099
01:22:27,588 --> 01:22:29,078
Her Rahul has also not come.

1100
01:22:29,557 --> 01:22:34,290
Go to hell with that Rahul who
did not turn up to show dreams.

1101
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:39,032
OK. you go.

1102
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:41,364
Get ready.

1103
01:22:52,647 --> 01:22:57,448

01:22:58,152 --> 01:23:03,055

Sit why are you puzzled.

Take wine.

1115
01:23:56,444 --> 01:24:01,245
See my name is definitely Muftlal

l don't have time to sit.
- Listen.

1119
01:24:11,759 --> 01:24:13,556
There is no time to talk.

1120
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:15,523
What can l say?

1121
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:18,256
Don't count.

1122
01:24:18,699 --> 01:24:21,395

Call her once. Tell her to hurry.

Bela's mother.

1131
01:24:55,169 --> 01:25:04,100
The ambience is
deserted without you.

1132
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:13,784
The life is angry with
me when you're not here.

You have aroused this desire.

1134

1153
01:27:06,567 --> 01:27:08,057
l wanted to talk with you that..

1154

l have prohibited you
not to talk with him.

Brother now l came to know
all the reality of the papa..

1157
01:27:49,443 --> 01:27:51,741
..and l shamed to tell him papa.

1158
01:27:51,979 --> 01:27:53,241
Priti.

1159
01:27:54,748 --> 01:27:57,046
Amar you are raising
hand on your sister. - Look mom.

1160
01:27:57,384 --> 01:27:59,215
Because of that scum..

1161
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,488
..she's saying such
lowly things about papa.

1162
01:28:01,722 --> 01:28:05,453
What do you know about
your papa. Your father..

1163
01:28:05,526 --> 01:28:08,689
Thakurain if you speak a
single word again then..

1164
01:28:08,996 --> 01:28:09,985
Why?

1165
01:28:10,197 --> 01:28:13,394
You are feeling shame to listen your
reality in front of your children.

1166
01:28:14,702 --> 01:28:16,966
Why don't you tell your children..

1167
01:28:18,205 --> 01:28:21,402
..that you got this habit
of enjoyment in hereditary?

1168
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:25,140
This is the part of your house.

1169
01:28:25,212 --> 01:28:27,009
Shut up.
- Why?

1170
01:28:27,548 --> 01:28:29,209
Thakur you tell your son..

1171
01:28:30,084 --> 01:28:31,984
..that this is the
tradition of your house.

1172
01:28:32,453 --> 01:28:36,480
Today you are dong and
tomorrow he has to do the same.

1173
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:41,288
Papa how you forget that you
are having one daughter also.

1174
01:28:41,528 --> 01:28:43,120
Shut up.

1175
01:28:48,535 --> 01:28:50,469
Where this Maharaj is left out.

1176
01:28:50,971 --> 01:28:53,405
lf this girl run away
then he will shout on me.

1177
01:28:59,613 --> 01:29:01,046
Mufatlal.

1178
01:29:01,548 --> 01:29:04,312
Sir you came.
- Come.

1179
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:06,643
Ha.. what happened, sir?

First you go.

l will beat you.

1182
01:29:25,973 --> 01:29:30,569
Very good Muftlal this time you
have not brought the free items.

1183
01:29:31,045 --> 01:29:34,276
Now you be ready. l'm ready.

Come.. get out fast.

No.
- What are you doing.

1189
01:30:35,242 --> 01:30:38,507
l think this girl came to
run from the bed of Thakur.

01:30:39,413 --> 01:30:40,641
l also feel the same.

1191
01:30:43,183 --> 01:30:45,048
l told you earlier uncle.

1192
01:30:45,452 --> 01:30:48,148
lf that day only we would have
killed her in the pancyayat..

1193
01:30:48,355 --> 01:30:50,118
..then today we may
not see this day.

1194
01:30:50,691 --> 01:30:52,716
This girl has defamed the village.

1195
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,492
You now worry for
the neck and not nose.

1196
01:30:56,163 --> 01:30:58,495
Thakur will not leave
alive to any villager.

1197
01:30:58,665 --> 01:31:00,997
You don't worry fulwa..

1198
01:31:02,269 --> 01:31:06,330
..the work which we can not do that
day in panchayat we will do now.

1199
01:31:07,241 --> 01:31:10,142
After that we will beg
pardon to the thakur.

1200
01:31:13,046 --> 01:31:14,104
Where is girl.

1201
01:31:18,152 --> 01:31:19,210
Where is the girl?

1202
01:31:20,354 --> 01:31:22,049
Hey. Where is the girl?

1203
01:31:22,356 --> 01:31:24,415
Sir forgive us.
- Forgive you.

Bastard now you have full

01:31:31,965 --> 01:31:33,626
Sir there is nothing like that.

1207

There is nothing like that.
- Sir.

1208

Bastard you are the
leader of this village..

1209
01:31:38,205 --> 01:31:40,435
..and can not keep control
on the girls of the village.

1210
01:31:41,408 --> 01:31:46,607
lf l desire then this tradition
can be stopped like this thing.

1211
01:31:48,081 --> 01:31:51,244
Your livelihood is
being run because of me.

1212
01:31:51,351 --> 01:31:55,048
And you people are instigating the
girls of the village against me.

1213
01:31:55,155 --> 01:31:56,679
No.
- You..

1214
01:31:57,257 --> 01:32:00,226
No sir there is nothing like
that. We were going to kill her.

1215
01:32:00,294 --> 01:32:01,192
Shut up.

1216
01:32:01,261 --> 01:32:03,286
Sir now we will give
the girl to you only.

1217
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:05,728
You may do whatever
you want with her.

1218
01:32:05,999 --> 01:32:09,196
But there is no mistake of
the villagers in this sir.

1219
01:32:09,303 --> 01:32:11,669
l'm innocent.
- You fool!

1220
01:32:12,472 --> 01:32:16,670
You give the girl to me then l will
leave the life of the villagers.

1221
01:32:16,743 --> 01:32:18,438
Yes sir.
- Keep away.

1222
01:32:18,645 --> 01:32:21,011
You people go.

1223
01:32:21,114 --> 01:32:22,138
Hey. Come.

Go from here.
- No leave her.

My friend! Don't leave me.

You're late, Rahul.

1343
01:41:53,453 --> 01:41:58,720
You have taught him love and
this love has taken his life.

1344
01:42:00,660 --> 01:42:02,525
The villagers have killed him.

1345
01:42:04,063 --> 01:42:05,496
What Mangi has done wrong with you.

1346
01:42:06,232 --> 01:42:09,258
And why you left him alone.

1347
01:42:10,537 --> 01:42:12,004
Among these beasts.

Mangi!

01:42:30,123 --> 01:42:33,058
Don't leave me.

1352
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:38,458
My beloved.

1353
01:42:45,772 --> 01:42:46,761
Mukhi kaka..

1354
01:42:47,607 --> 01:42:50,667
..now all the gents of the village
have to obey the order of women.

1355
01:42:50,743 --> 01:42:53,337
What nonsense you are talking.
- This is the reality.

1356
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:54,569
Phulwa.

1357
01:42:55,381 --> 01:43:00,341
Today all the women of the village
have gone to burn pyre of the Mangi.

1358
01:43:08,061 --> 01:43:10,586
This is your wife.

1359
01:43:11,698 --> 01:43:13,689
Today only you go
with her to the city.

1360
01:43:14,567 --> 01:43:17,365
Perhaps tomorrow we may
no the here to help you.

1361
01:43:18,805 --> 01:43:23,606
lf by giving our sacrifice the
life of a girl is improved..

1362
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:26,469
..then we will be very happy.

1363
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:28,374
Today for the first time

1364
01:43:28,548 --> 01:43:30,641
l have seen the revolution
in the eyes of woman.

1365
01:43:30,717 --> 01:43:32,048
Then what to do.

1366
01:43:32,418 --> 01:43:34,716
Shall we go to work in the fields?

1367
01:43:35,488 --> 01:43:37,388
We should disgrace our ancestors?

1368
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:40,983
Now what are you thinking.

1369
01:43:42,762 --> 01:43:47,199
Now our desire will
not be fulfilled.

1370
01:43:48,134 --> 01:43:50,728
lt won't be done.
- Now what is the purpose Rahul.

1371
01:43:52,972 --> 01:43:56,032
l wanted to change
the village entirely.

1372
01:43:56,442 --> 01:43:58,740
l want to finish the
tradition for ever.

1373
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:05,046
But when mangi has gone then my
purpose will no the fulfilled like this.

1374
01:44:05,652 --> 01:44:07,779
Tomorrow someone else will
be sent in place of Bela.

1375
01:44:09,656 --> 01:44:12,454
Aunt, l wanted to
tell the villagers..

1376
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,456
..girls aren't to be
sold but to worship.

1377
01:44:18,798 --> 01:44:20,595
My dream will remain incomplete.

1378
01:44:21,701 --> 01:44:25,728
What you think that you
will change this tradition.

1379
01:44:27,707 --> 01:44:29,937
The girl who refuses
to do business is..

1380
01:44:30,643 --> 01:44:33,009
..burnt by the
villagers in no time.

1381
01:44:34,948 --> 01:44:35,972
Whether..

1382
01:44:36,449 --> 01:44:38,383
..it's her own father.

1383
01:44:38,985 --> 01:44:42,284
The woman who will support that
city man will be burnt alive.

1384
01:44:42,455 --> 01:44:44,355
Haria just cool down.

1385
01:44:46,759 --> 01:44:48,556
lf all the woman will die..

1386
01:44:48,761 --> 01:44:50,729
..then villagers
have to start begging.

1387
01:44:51,598 --> 01:44:53,589
You only tell something.

1388
01:44:55,101 --> 01:44:57,399
There is.

1389
01:44:59,539 --> 01:45:01,302
There is a method.

1390
01:45:02,442 --> 01:45:05,570
We have to create fear in
the heart of these woman.

1391
01:45:06,012 --> 01:45:07,001
How?

1392
01:45:09,415 --> 01:45:11,110
lt is too late in night.

1393
01:45:12,685 --> 01:45:15,210
Now that boy will
no go to the city.

1394
01:45:16,456 --> 01:45:18,390
He will stay in the village only.

1395
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,489
l tell you to set fire in the
house where he is going to stay.

1396
01:45:24,697 --> 01:45:28,497
Along with that burn the
woman who shelters her.

1397
01:45:30,737 --> 01:45:32,261
Tell me are you agreed.

1398
01:45:32,338 --> 01:45:33,430
Yes!

1399
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:37,532
Mangatram you agree to it.

l agree, chief.

1401
01:45:42,048 --> 01:45:43,538
We'll do as you say.

1402
01:45:45,118 --> 01:45:46,710
l've taken side of
my daughter a lot.

1403
01:45:47,253 --> 01:45:52,384
When it has taken so much
time for us then just think

1404
01:45:52,725 --> 01:45:56,161
how much time it will take to
convince the gents of this village.

1405
01:45:57,430 --> 01:45:59,455
How it has taken this much time.

1406
01:46:00,967 --> 01:46:02,730
How the mother have tolerated..

1407
01:46:03,036 --> 01:46:08,531
..to sale the body of their
daughters in front of their own eyes.

1408
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:17,106
Women of this village have
been enduring atrocities..

1409
01:46:17,316 --> 01:46:20,080
..for ages thinking it's a custom.

1410
01:46:20,286 --> 01:46:21,981
l will not go back
to give sacrifice..

1411
01:46:22,722 --> 01:46:25,623
..of my daughter to
save this tradition.

1412
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,987
Do as you want.
- Then its O.K.

1413
01:46:30,329 --> 01:46:33,298
But now.. now nobody
will do anything.

1414
01:46:34,233 --> 01:46:37,202
All may go to their home.

1415
01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:38,735
Fine. Go now.

1416
01:46:40,273 --> 01:46:42,002
Bela is correctly telling Rahul.

1417
01:46:43,476 --> 01:46:46,001
Till the people
having such a thought..

1418
01:46:47,513 --> 01:46:49,640
..will remain in the village
this tradition will go on.

1419
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:52,179
There is no other way.

1420
01:46:52,251 --> 01:46:53,411
There is a way.

1421
01:46:59,292 --> 01:47:00,384
There is a way.

1422
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:37,320
Bastard you were telling that
the pyre of Mangi is burning..

1423
01:47:38,064 --> 01:47:40,225
..and here the entire
village is burning.

1424
01:47:47,173 --> 01:47:49,437
Sir the women of this
village has set this fire.

1425
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:52,671
Yes l can see.

1426
01:47:55,982 --> 01:47:58,075
l was waiting for
this time since long.

1427
01:47:59,952 --> 01:48:04,719
They're dying without
any effort on our part.

1428
01:48:05,024 --> 01:48:06,013
Means..

1429
01:48:07,026 --> 01:48:13,056
Today if we give
support to these women..

1430
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:19,094
..then we need not go to
take bath in the ganga.

1431
01:48:52,638 --> 01:48:53,935
This is good.

1432
01:48:56,175 --> 01:48:59,338
l feel very good to see..

1433
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:05,745
..the women of this village
fighting for their right.

1434
01:49:08,955 --> 01:49:14,359
l told earlier that if you want
to finish this system for ever..

1435
01:49:14,427 --> 01:49:25,531
..then first of all the dirty mind of
the village will have to be removed.

1436
01:49:28,741 --> 01:49:29,969
You did it.

1437
01:49:31,611 --> 01:49:33,511
This is very good.

1438
01:49:34,247 --> 01:49:35,236
Huh?

1439
01:49:37,683 --> 01:49:39,048
l'm with you today.

1440
01:49:42,321 --> 01:49:47,486
Today.. a small office
of law is with you.

1441
01:49:49,028 --> 01:49:52,054
But l can claim that
tomorrow entire..

1442
01:49:52,131 --> 01:49:55,658
..law and country will be with you.

1443
01:49:58,304 --> 01:49:59,532
What about this village..

1444
01:50:00,673 --> 01:50:03,506
This village had
to be burnt one day.

1445
01:50:04,043 --> 01:50:08,241
l think to end this custom
this was the only way left.

1446
01:50:10,283 --> 01:50:11,773
Chandu.
- Yes sir.

1447
01:50:13,252 --> 01:50:16,187
Call the collector office. Tell
him that all the houses are burnt..

1448
01:50:17,089 --> 01:50:19,489
..and they need some time to
rehabilitate them from new.

1449
01:50:19,558 --> 01:50:21,685
Tell them that villagers
have become homeless.

1450
01:50:22,194 --> 01:50:23,718
We'll need some tents.

1451
01:50:24,163 --> 01:50:27,564
Some more amenities required
to settle the houses.

1452
01:50:28,034 --> 01:50:31,197
And some medicines,
food and clothes..

1453
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:36,769
This burning village
is no the way..

1454
01:50:37,977 --> 01:50:40,605
..but the pain and
sorrow of the women.

1455
01:50:42,181 --> 01:50:47,084
Neither any saint nor
messiah came for our help.

1456
01:50:48,154 --> 01:50:51,612
Everyone used us.

1457
01:50:52,792 --> 01:50:55,693
Our own thought of us
as means of earning and..

1458
01:50:56,529 --> 01:50:58,394
..others thought of us
as means of pleasure.

1459
01:50:59,498 --> 01:51:01,193
But for how long?
