00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,260
(Birds Chirping)

2
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:16,783
- You must have added the chemical, right?
- Yes. I have.

3
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:19,233
Check the ones at the bottom.

4
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:22,138
- Have you taken the readings?
- What?

5
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:25,146
- Have you taken the readings?
- The readings are correct, boss.

6
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:27,930
I have told you so many
times that I'm not the boss.

7
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,656
The boss is sitting downstairs.

8
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:31,581
Jai. Okay, boss.

9
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,541
Boss again?

10
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:36,115
You will not change. That's four.

11
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:40,669
- Jai. Is that okay?
- Correct.

12
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:43,862
Okay listen. Check this vessel as well.

13
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:46,934
Everything's alright. You've
made me an expert in six months, boss.

14
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:48,794
He keeps calling me boss.

15
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:55,094
4...We have to get more
from downstairs as well.

16
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:56,892
(Gas Leaked Sound)

17
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:02,055
Do the switch off.

18
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,101
That line is leaking.

19
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:11,852
The entire line is leaking.

20
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:14,210
- What happened?
- We'll have to change this line.

21
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,004
Line? There is a need
to change this entire plant.

22
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,534
Apply some ice on it.

23
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:24,251
Anand sir. Excuse me. Apply ice.

24
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:31,531
- Sir. Anand sir.
- Okay. I'll talk to him.

25
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,711
- There's a line leaking over there.
- What's the status of the paper?

26
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,975
- I want it right now.
- Sir, this is dangerous. Digant got injured.

27
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:38,187
Okay. Okay. Will be repaired
in the next shift. Take the samples first.

28
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:39,915
- It is more important to send it.
- Sir, but the line...

29
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:42,478
It's a minor injury.
He'll be fine. Okay?

30
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:53,407
- So folks, how was the day today?
- Alright as usual.

31
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:56,110
Digant, why are you applying ice?

32
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,593
The dryer got me real good.

33
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:03,117
- Is it?
- The steam line had leaked.

34
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,359
I had a narrow escape.
This plant is very dangerous.

35
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,914
This has become a daily thing.
Come. Let's go talk outside.

36
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:10,494
(Coughing)

37
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,422
Manoj. Come here. I want to talk to you.

38
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:18,134
- Come with us.
- I'm busy now. I have a meeting to attend.

39
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:21,701
- So go later.
- I said I'll come and talk later.

40
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,644
Bosses must be waiting.

41
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:26,431
So tell them that a worker
had a narrow escape just now.

42
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:29,117
Meagre salary and major dangers.

43
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,789
Come on.

44
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:37,023
Now there is no point in keeping quiet.

45
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,523
The situation is going from bad to worse.

46
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:41,786
If this continues all the workers
would end up either at the hospital..

47
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,459
..or in the graveyard one day.

48
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:48,814
You also get your scooter fixed.

49
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,733
It could break down any time.

50
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:55,588
And you consult a doctor.

51
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:59,338
I have told you so many times.
You just don't listen.

52
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:05,131
What's the point? He'll diagnose
the disease and charge a hefty fees.

53
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:07,750
Then die coughing.

54
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,250
Because the union just
doesn't care about us.

55
00:05:10,488 --> 00:05:14,546
And Manoj. No one knows
what he does at these meetings?

56
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:16,641
What could we have done?

57
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,597
Everyone was voting for Manoj.

58
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:21,793
So we did too.

59
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:24,378
We'll vote for you too if you contest.

60
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,351
So who is being given the vote?

61
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,918
The one who is able to work for all of us.

62
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:33,297
- I do.
- Yes. You've done a lot of work.

63
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,408
- It's for everyone to see.
- What happened?

64
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:38,905
You're getting everything. Salary on time.

65
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:43,364
Just salary. People are getting sick.

66
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,881
People are dying of cancer.
Can't you see all this?

67
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:51,354
Look at him.
He is in need of treatment badly.

68
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:55,762
Cancer? Who died of cancer?

69
00:05:56,083 --> 00:06:00,762
- Three?
- I see. Three have died of cancer.

70
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:04,258
And no one knows. Great.

71
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,434
You can be a leader for sure.

72
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:13,921
What did you say?
You think this is a joke.

73
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:18,126
The death of workers is a joke to you.
Is this a game?

74
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,425
Why are you biting
the hands that feed you?

75
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,317
The worker didn't die of cancer.
But due to excessive smoking.

76
00:06:28,246 --> 00:06:30,030
If you don't believe
then read the blood report.

77
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,619
Not all workers smoke.

78
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,160
And the other worker has asthma.

79
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,360
Every third person has ulcer.

80
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,165
Many have gaping holes in their noses.

81
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:39,891
Can't you see this?
Do you want everyone dead?

82
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,291
If you have so many problem
then find another job.

83
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,599
Why are you ruining their livelihood?

84
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:48,842
If I had been in your place this
situation would've never arose. Got it?

85
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:53,133
I see. So replace me.

86
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,691
Form your own union.
And then fight for rights.

87
00:06:57,953 --> 00:07:00,096
It's easier said than done.

88
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:04,301
You're left screaming but no one bothers.

89
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,204
Got it? Be happy with what you're getting.

90
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:13,492
Or you'll lose this as well. Tell him.

91
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,518
Or he'll lose the job as well as...

92
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:25,286
Why do you blabber so much?
Can't you keep quiet?

93
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:28,421
This is happening because we keep quiet.

94
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,089
He thinks we are morons.

95
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:34,587
What does he think?
Only he can run the union.

96
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:39,251
Jai, we won't spare him this time.

97
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,992
We'll form our own union.

98
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:42,895
Only then will he know his place.

99
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:45,791
Union and stuff is not my cup of tea.

100
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:49,381
- Someone will have to start.
- Shall we?

101
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:56,278
- Let's have food.
- Jai. Jai. Boss. Listen to me.

102
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:03,305
Mamma, give me another flatbread.

103
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,153
There is no flatbread. Have rice.

104
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,691
How are your studies going?

105
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,841
- Papa is asking something.
- Great.

106
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:19,781
- Great. My foot.
- Great means great.

107
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:23,478
Have you gone mad?
He is asking about studies.

108
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:25,491
I'm talking about studies.
It's going fine.

109
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,892
I topped the previous exams.

110
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:30,292
You won't get admission
in medical because of that.

111
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,954
- Harsh.
- What?

112
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,916
- Answer him.
- I did.

113
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,619
Study hard. Score good grades.

114
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:47,092
Or I'll have to do labour
work in a factory like you.

115
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:48,743
Geeta.

116
00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:01,868
We've borrowed a loan for your
studies so that your life gets made.

117
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:09,197
How many other kids here
study in an English medium school?

118
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,492
- Tell me.
- All the schools are the same.

119
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,419
All they do is teach to memorize.

120
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:20,440
Pass and get a job. Fit into the system.

121
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,091
What's wrong in fitting into the system?

122
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,548
No one teaches how
to become a good person.

123
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:32,495
How to live in harmony with everyone?

124
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,092
I hate this society.

125
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:43,101
- Never mind him. Here.
- It's okay.

126
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,522
What's wrong with him?

127
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:52,408
Don't know. Ever since he has visited
Gandhi's ashram he has been obsessed.

128
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,785
Gandhi's ashram?

129
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:59,091
Why does he go there?

130
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:03,433
How would I know? You ask him.

131
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,952
Our life is hell.

132
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:14,752
Now his will be too.

133
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:17,271
Eat.

134
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:27,892
Remote.

135
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,031
Why did you change?

136
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,891
Are they teaching you
all this at Gandhi's ashram?

137
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:42,291
Answering back.

138
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,691
Saying the right thing not answering back.

139
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:49,167
(Crying)

140
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:58,761
I have raised with you much difficulty.

141
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,313
Even sold my jewellery.

142
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:06,929
I've spared anything for myself
so that you don't lack anything.

143
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,849
And you...

144
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:15,892
Sorry, mamma.

145
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:27,189
Once you become a doctor,
all will prosper.

146
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,141
I'm all geared up. Why are you worrying?

147
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,557
- Really?
- Yes.

148
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:45,826
What are you thinking?

149
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:49,124
Nothing.

150
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:51,762
Tell me.

151
00:11:55,016 --> 00:12:00,389
I'm thinking of starting the
work of gear bearing in vehicles.

152
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,907
We'll get some extra income.

153
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:10,561
Start with your scooter.

154
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:14,734
You also harass me.

155
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:18,291
Uncle Raman is harassing me.

156
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:22,301
He spoke of the rent in public today.

157
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,756
Why don't you ask Digant?

158
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:29,404
He also rides pillion
with you on the scooter.

159
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:33,394
He should share the petrol money. Right?

160
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:39,772
He is like my little brother.

161
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:49,080
I'll borrow money from someone.

162
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,312
Not at all.

163
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:54,863
We're also neck deep in debts.

164
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:00,949
I've made a huge mistake by sending
Harsh to an English medium school.

165
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,652
I'll not let Harsh lack anything.

166
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,942
(Rooster Crowing Sound)

167
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:33,078
Jai, the condition of this
place is also like your scooter.

168
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,091
It could stop any time if not repaired.

169
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:38,354
- What? The plant?
- Your scooter.

170
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,078
This time the repairing
proved very costly.

171
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,257
So you should've told us.
We would also helped.

172
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:50,494
You will have to from
the next time. Got it?

173
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:51,892
Or no free lift.

174
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,678
- Who is saying no?
- Jai.

175
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,536
Prakash has passed out. Come fast.

176
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:57,920
- What?
- Yes. Over there.

177
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,056
Come on.

178
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:08,959
- Prakash.
- Prakash.

179
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,485
- Prakash.
- Prakash.

180
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:13,788
What happened?

181
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:17,075
Prakash.

182
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,729
The ambulance hasn't come.
I've got an auto rickshaw.

183
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:20,501
Come on. Pick him up.

184
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:22,674
- Prakash.
- Carry him. Come on.

185
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:24,458
Prakash. Open your eyes.

186
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,836
You'll be fine.
You'll be fine. Careful. Careful.

187
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:30,291
Come.

188
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:32,490
He has brought the rickshaw inside.

189
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,092
Come on. Come with me.

190
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:37,906
What's wrong with him?

191
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:40,360
He has met the same fate as others.

192
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,705
Inhaling the Chromium Sulphate
has destroyed his lungs.

193
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:44,057
So take him to the hospital.

194
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,851
So why don't you help us?

195
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:47,722
Does the company have
any facility called emergency?

196
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:48,738
- Come on.
- Nonsense.

197
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,188
- Come on.
- Come on.

198
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,458
What's the status on the rickshaw?

199
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,068
It is here.

200
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:00,857
Brother, thank you so much.

201
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,197
God knows what might
have happened if not for you.

202
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,291
Why are you embarrassing me?

203
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:09,279
It's all the Almighty's grace.

204
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:15,387
How are you, Prakash?

205
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:22,456
You guys talk. I'll get tea.

206
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,456
I told you so many times to see a doctor.

207
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:30,153
But you just don't listen.

208
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:33,732
It was just cough. Little did I know...

209
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:36,511
We'll know what the problem
once the complete diagnosis is done.

210
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:37,850
It's not going to be of any use.

211
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:41,223
It's Rita ma'am's way
of getting money out of me.

212
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:45,407
I see. Let me also see
how much money you have on you.

213
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:48,791
Raise your hands.
I'll take all the money today.

214
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,892
Okay. Lie down straight.
Don't move your hands.

215
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:01,136
Uncle, check.
If the money in your pocket is lesser.

216
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:05,536
The money isn't less but
it seems the blood is less.

217
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:22,466
Jai, at this old age my family
needs me and this is my condition.

218
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:27,892
What will be of Kasi once I'm gone?

219
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:34,423
Don't worry at all. And you bet.

220
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:38,369
We'll have tea at your house very soon.

221
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,293
Do you know?

222
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:49,492
Ram Prakash too was coughing
like this before dying.

223
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:54,056
We didn't pay attention.

224
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:59,092
But you guys pay attention.

225
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,158
For the sake of your kids and wives.

226
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:05,905
This is what I have been
trying to explain since long.

227
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:07,797
But no one is listening to me.

228
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:09,516
All of you have become deaf.

229
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,635
- Digant, let's go out.
- Where?

230
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:14,100
- Come on.
- Jai.

231
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,613
- Come on.
- Listen to me.

232
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:17,786
Why are you creating a scene?
This is a hospital.

233
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,624
- Try to understand.
- I'm creating a scene.

234
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,586
I'm creating a scene.
And what the company is doing is nothing.

235
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,491
- Go from here. Go. Come on.
- Jai.

236
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:26,749
Let's talk later.

237
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,905
- We'll not keep quiet.
We'll show the company its place.
- Go.

238
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:33,246
Got it? I'll show the company its place.

239
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,229
You have helped us in a
big way by saving Prakash's life.

240
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,428
- Thanks.
- That's my duty.

241
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:46,455
Prakash is like my father.

242
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,423
Indeed you're working very honestly.

243
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:54,291
If you continue working
in this vein our company..

244
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,953
..will soon be Gujarat's top company.

245
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:59,091
And by then God knows
how any workers would die?

246
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:00,747
- What?
- Yes.

247
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:03,081
This company is earning profits
at the cost of people's lives.

248
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:07,849
- What rubbish.
- Ignore him. He is crazy.

249
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,374
He gets such attacks from time to time.

250
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:12,823
Okay. The company will fix this as well.

251
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,892
Cure your greed first.

252
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:17,947
All we need is safety and health.

253
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:21,794
Why are you barking?
Do you realise who you're talking to?

254
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:23,978
He is this company's owner.

255
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:26,454
- Boss.
- So? Are we any lesser?

256
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:28,249
The plant is working because of us.

257
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:32,108
Listen. If the situation doesn't
improve soon we'll form a new union.

258
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:34,433
And if you still don't do anything
we'll go to the labour ministry..

259
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,860
..and bring you on
the right track. Darn it.

260
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:49,027
Last year, two of our co-workers
Ram Prakash and Harish died of cancer.

261
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,200
Rizwan too.

262
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,167
Everyone died of Chromium
Sulphate inhalation.

263
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:55,242
Yes. Everyone knows that
these deaths weren't natural.

264
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:56,692
But no one speaks out.

265
00:18:57,405 --> 00:19:00,551
And the one who should
is licking the boss's boots.

266
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:03,232
Smart Alec,
why are you instigating everyone?

267
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:09,038
Friends, we know that we are in talks
with the management about the salary.

268
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:11,092
We've been hearing this since long.

269
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,363
Do talks fill our stomachs?

270
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,898
Do talks fill our stomachs?

271
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:17,968
Look, have some patience.

272
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:21,957
Company is setting up a new plant in Vapi.

273
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,833
- As soon as the plant is set up...
- Enough. Keep quiet.

274
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,636
We've heard enough.
Keep quiet.

275
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:29,546
Friend, there is no
point in listening to him.

276
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,941
Now is the time for a new union,
for a new union leader.

277
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:35,091
I propose Jai Goel's
name for the new union leader.

278
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:37,093
Jai.

279
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:39,742
Yes. Jai is the right choice.

280
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:41,761
(Crowd Applauding)

281
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:55,051
Friends, I understood
your feelings very well.

282
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:58,976
But I'm requesting all
of you with folded hands.

283
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:03,257
I'm not worthy of this.

284
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:37,573
(Bike Engine Sound)

285
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,446
See you tomorrow.

286
00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:22,512
Papa, hats off.

287
00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:24,999
You're still using the
scooter that's older than me.

288
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,609
Where are you going so late?

289
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:27,891
For some work of the ashram.

290
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:33,917
Ashram? You have exams.
You should be studying.

291
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:36,695
Trust me. I'll not disappoint you.

292
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,760
Papa, you're making me a doctor
so that I serve everyone, isn't it?

293
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:46,112
This is what they teach me at the ashram.
But in a slightly different way.

294
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:48,036
Is it? How is that?

295
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:51,891
As in all of us should be healthy.
No one should need a doctor.

296
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:57,074
A good doctor doesn't judge
the symptoms but roots out the disease.

297
00:21:57,344 --> 00:22:00,512
I don't understand things that you say.

298
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:03,452
Papa, for example.

299
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:07,593
You clean the scooter's
corroborator twice a week.

300
00:22:07,863 --> 00:22:11,561
Why? Because you use adulterated
petrol as it is cheap.

301
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:14,232
This is why your gasket
too conks out repeatedly.

302
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:16,232
But you don't change the engine oil.

303
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,291
And eventually the engine fails.

304
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:22,955
You're treating the symptoms
of the disease and not rooting it out.

305
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:24,544
Yes. Go. Go.

306
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:26,404
This wouldn't have happened if
you had maintained it since the start.

307
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:28,501
- Go. Go.
- Okay. Bye.

308
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:50,351
Rest. Have proper sleep.

309
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:53,356
And this is very
important for your health.

310
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,983
Is it something serious?

311
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:59,713
No. No. It's not a serious problem.

312
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:03,767
Come to me if you cough a lot
or if you have trouble breathing. Got it?

313
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,399
And...

314
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,091
..keep taking this medicine
till the urine clears up.

315
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,351
Stop. Stop. The road is closed.

316
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:21,811
Go by the back road.

317
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:23,821
My friend lives here. I have to go there.

318
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,356
Ask the friend to come here.

319
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:26,675
Or wait.

320
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,679
- What...What has happened here?
- A murder.

321
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,274
Murder? Whose?

322
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:36,090
How would I know?

323
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,393
I don't carry the deceased's I-card, do I?

324
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:42,739
Get back. Get back.

325
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,202
He is not answering the call.

326
00:23:49,282 --> 00:23:52,673
The number you're trying
to reach is currently switched off.

327
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:56,229
Sir, my friend is
not picking up the phone.

328
00:23:56,383 --> 00:23:58,013
But you can't go from here.

329
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:00,369
Give me your friend's
name and flat number.

330
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,720
His name is Digant.
And flat number is 219.

331
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,292
219? The murder has happened there.

332
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:09,266
You stay here.
I'll go call sir.

333
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:25,136
How long have you known Digant?

334
00:24:27,644 --> 00:24:29,147
For three years.

335
00:24:29,227 --> 00:24:30,920
How do you know him?

336
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:33,968
We were co-workers.

337
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:37,491
And we had become friends.
(Crying)

338
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:40,661
Did he have enemies?

339
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:50,952
Don't know. I don't know.

340
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:56,691
Without marriage. Without kids.

341
00:24:58,238 --> 00:25:00,281
He had wretched luck.

342
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,919
- He has been murdered.
- Murder?

343
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,017
Whose murder?

344
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:09,330
One of my friends. You don't know.

345
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:14,109
- Sorry.
- I don't know.

346
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:18,130
- I'm going out.
- So late?

347
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,017
I'm feeling kind of uneasy.

348
00:25:21,757 --> 00:25:25,492
What's done is done.
We can't change it, can we?

349
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,541
But I can set straight
what's wrong, right?

350
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:32,454
This is what Diga was trying to do.

351
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,930
This is why he was murdered.

352
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,784
Don't get into this mess.

353
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:47,752
He was like my little brother.
He was fighting for our rights.

354
00:25:48,984 --> 00:25:50,725
We can't just sit at home quietly, right?

355
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:02,802
There are other workers too at the plant.
To do all this.

356
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,886
Don't bring the politics there home.

357
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:08,051
Are you aware of the problems
the workers are having?

358
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:11,091
They have been working for
all these years. Look at the salaries?

359
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:12,747
How can they sustain themselves?

360
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:16,276
Whatever the case.
We are living peacefully, right?

361
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,870
We don't need any more problems.

362
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:21,240
Listen to me.

363
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:44,692
'I'm creating a scene.
And what the company is doing is nothing.'

364
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:47,827
'- Go from here. Go. Come on.
- Jai.'

365
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,865
'Let's talk later.'

366
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:51,891
'- We'll not keep quiet.
We'll show the company its place.
- Go.'

367
00:26:52,156 --> 00:26:55,708
'Got it? I'll show the company its place.'

368
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:10,266
(Birds Chirping)

369
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:13,221
(Knock On Door)

370
00:27:14,226 --> 00:27:15,113
Let me see.

371
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:24,680
I had told you. We'll have tea at home.

372
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:30,291
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

373
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:33,458
Everyone's asking about you.

374
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:35,588
I would've come tomorrow if I could.

375
00:27:35,912 --> 00:27:38,539
But this darned disease.

376
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:41,708
No salary.

377
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,178
And the cost of medicines to add to it.

378
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,778
Let me know if you need anything.

379
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:52,648
You're already doing so much.

380
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:57,200
Not even my own would've done so much.

381
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:02,162
What are you saying? We are family.

382
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:33,977
The doctor has said that
he doesn't have much time.

383
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:46,701
He has cancer. The doctor has given up.
(Crying)

384
00:28:56,442 --> 00:29:00,582
Gentlemen, Digant was like my child.

385
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:06,994
I taught him work with these very hands.

386
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:12,940
He was so hardworking.
He would do his work.

387
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:18,292
And he would also lend others a hand.

388
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:25,491
And he used to fight for his rights.

389
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,155
And this is what I
liked about him the most.

390
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:34,397
(Coughing)

391
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,925
Hold him. Hold him.

392
00:29:44,547 --> 00:29:46,763
Prakash was trying to say that..

393
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:54,965
..Digant was a very good man.

394
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,871
He wished well for all of us.

395
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:06,292
He would always say. These bosses need us.

396
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:07,777
We don't need them.

397
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:15,737
And this is why
perhaps...he lost his life.

398
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:23,521
Look at Prakash. His condition is so bad.

399
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:26,898
And same is the condition
of many of our co-workers.

400
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:31,074
What was his dream?

401
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:34,237
Now who is going to fulfil his dream?

402
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:41,412
What you just say is
the sample of industry.

403
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:45,979
It symbolises self-reliance
and the dignity of labour.

404
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,492
Gandhi was never against capitalism.

405
00:30:49,572 --> 00:30:51,891
According to him the labourers
get the product ready.

406
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:53,898
And increase the capital.

407
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,952
That's why the boss should
take care of the workers as a trustee.

408
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:00,993
And hence the workers
become co sharers with..

409
00:31:01,073 --> 00:31:03,891
..capitalism instead of remaining a slave.

410
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:08,518
That's why the boss looks
after the workers' welfare.

411
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:10,355
So take a look around.

412
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,287
And we'll continue the
tour after a short break.

413
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:21,612
Papa, you?

414
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:24,234
What are you doing?

415
00:31:27,248 --> 00:31:32,518
Had I been in your place
I would've been buried in my books.

416
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:36,802
Just as you can't work all the
time I too can't study all the time.

417
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,383
I like coming here.

418
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:41,532
You won't gain anything from here.

419
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:44,532
Do you understand status quo?

420
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,091
It means maintaining
the current situation.

421
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:49,046
Not bringing any change in it.

422
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:53,559
Gandhi would say that we'll
perish if we don't change.

423
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:56,692
That's why I believe in
change and not in status quo.

424
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:02,614
- Now may I go?
- Go.

425
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:34,167
- Sir.
- Yes. What is it?

426
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,140
I want to meet Mr. Parmar.

427
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:38,099
Go straight and turn right.

428
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:41,099
- Mr. Parmar.
- That's me. Tell me.

429
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:43,031
I want to talk to you. It's urgent.
I need just two minutes.

430
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:44,531
Come tomorrow. I'm already late today.

431
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:46,679
- Sir, have you heard of Apollo chemicals.
- Come tomorrow.

432
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,801
We manufacture Chromium Sulphate.

433
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:49,179
I'm the plant operator there.

434
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,260
The condition of the plant is very bad.

435
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:53,450
The workers are suffering
from all kinds of diseases.

436
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,409
And the bosses are
just not bothered about it.

437
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,301
Diseases? What diseases?

438
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:02,477
Sir, difficulty in breathing.
Holes in the noses.

439
00:33:02,736 --> 00:33:05,531
Ulcer. Cancer.

440
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:13,004
Come with me.

441
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,355
Look, for the safety of the workers..

442
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:20,328
..for the protection
of their rights...Sit.

443
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:25,936
Government has made some strict rules.

444
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:30,292
And it's the responsibility of
every company to comply with the rules.

445
00:33:31,057 --> 00:33:34,652
And then Chromium Sulphate
is produced at your plant.

446
00:33:35,477 --> 00:33:40,666
At a plant like that, every worker
must get a health check every two years.

447
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:43,693
I've been working in this
company for the past 10 years.

448
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,937
There hasn't been a
medical check-up even once.

449
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,964
Look, I've been transferred
here from Mumbai just recently.

450
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:56,288
So I don't have much
info about your plant.

451
00:33:56,368 --> 00:34:00,815
But as you're describing it's clear that..

452
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:04,315
..your company is not
treating the workers well.

453
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:09,828
What does your union leader do?
It's his responsibility.

454
00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:12,815
I wonder what he is doing.

455
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:18,883
- We are really fed up.
- Do this.

456
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:23,370
Give me your name,
address and contact number.

457
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:25,099
We'll conduct an inquiry.

458
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:38,586
Manoj. Manoj.

459
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,924
I have spoken to the labour inspector.

460
00:34:43,553 --> 00:34:47,411
He says that the workers should
get a health check every two years.

461
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:50,127
Jai, why are you getting
involved in these things?

462
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:53,100
It's the question of the workers' health.

463
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,816
I want you to talk to
Ketul sir regarding this.

464
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:00,816
Okay. I will.

465
00:35:07,362 --> 00:35:10,303
I said I will. Go.

466
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:23,465
Okay, you've been working
here since before me.

467
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:27,397
Do you remember?
Has there ever been a health check-up?

468
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:30,978
Health check-up?
What's that? I've never heard of it.

469
00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:35,479
When we came here 12 years
ago our body was examined. Remember?

470
00:35:36,138 --> 00:35:40,478
Yes. The doctors in the white clothes.
With the pretty nurse.

471
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:44,978
She injected. It was painful.
My hand was hurting for two days.

472
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:47,092
They pressed my hand and left.

473
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:50,290
But the check-up never happened again.

474
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:53,140
What is Manoj saying?

475
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,086
What's he going to say?
The same. He is evading it.

476
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:03,892
All are frauds. And I don't
think anything's going to happen.

477
00:36:07,455 --> 00:36:08,631
(Knock On Door)

478
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:11,953
So late at night?

479
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,250
Let me see.

480
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,869
(Door Opens)

481
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:22,454
- Raman, you?
- Have I come at the wrong time?

482
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:24,468
You should've called me.
I would've come over.

483
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:28,400
- Would you like some tea?
- No. I had it at Joshi's place.

484
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:31,602
I thought of collecting
the rent on the way.

485
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,089
It' been two months.

486
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:35,359
I'm in need of money this time.

487
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:40,318
Uncle, this time I'll
get salary a little late.

488
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:43,128
I'll give you as soon as I get it.

489
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:44,691
Give me one month's rent.

490
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:46,966
Pay the other month's later.

491
00:36:49,169 --> 00:36:51,696
Now? There is no money
in the house right now.

492
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:54,993
I'll withdraw from the
bank and give you tomorrow.

493
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:02,534
Okay. I'll wait. But mind you.

494
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:05,507
I'm in need of money this time.

495
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:16,561
He owns ten houses.
Still he is in need of money.

496
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:22,358
Did you talk to them about a raise?

497
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,642
- You don't get a raise just like that.
- Why?

498
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,292
You do the most work in the factory.

499
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:32,561
Will you just keep quiet? Please.

500
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:41,170
It's okay. I'll sell the scooter.

501
00:37:44,952 --> 00:37:48,967
Sell it. There isn't
anything else to sell.

502
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:58,884
So now how are you going to travel now?

503
00:37:58,964 --> 00:38:00,424
I'll figure something out later.

504
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,951
Don't bother yourself.

505
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:07,100
My bike is lying gathering dust.

506
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:12,964
You use it. Return it when I resume work.

507
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:28,492
Do think about what Digant said once.

508
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,072
You're saying this?

509
00:38:31,717 --> 00:38:33,437
There is no other choice.

510
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:38,410
Digant was emotional but he wasn't mature.

511
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:41,504
You're mature.

512
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:46,031
Let me speak to Manoj
and Ketul sir once at length.

513
00:38:48,274 --> 00:38:50,152
It won't help.

514
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:53,638
He wouldn't want Manoj to step down.

515
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:59,092
Ketul has bought him.

516
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:03,138
How do you know?

517
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:06,291
Go have tea at his house once.

518
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,463
You'll understand everything.

519
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:13,565
(Bike Engine Sound)

520
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:50,666
There are better workers
at the plant than me.

521
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:53,990
That's not the case.
You've trained everyone.

522
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:57,462
You're senior.
And everyone listens to you.

523
00:39:57,542 --> 00:40:00,516
So we want you to be our new leader.

524
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:05,691
But Bala. Prakash.

525
00:40:09,231 --> 00:40:11,091
I know nothing about the union.

526
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,352
Tell me something.

527
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:16,217
Did you know everything
when you came to this plant?

528
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:20,352
He's right.

529
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:23,892
Think about it.

530
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:28,717
It's better to die fighting
than to die of disease.

531
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:07,378
- Jai.
- Yes, Anand sir.

532
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,540
Ketul sir wants to see you.

533
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,386
- Tell him I'll come in a bit.
- Do that later.

534
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:13,901
He is waiting.

535
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:15,319
(Phone Ringing)

536
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:24,175
Come, Jai. Welcome.

537
00:41:29,552 --> 00:41:35,865
We are sorry about what has
transpired in the past two months.

538
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:41,419
You know. Digant's death
has hit our plant badly.

539
00:41:42,797 --> 00:41:47,581
We are sorry about Prakash's ailment.

540
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:51,892
During this time, the honesty
and earnestness with which you've worked.

541
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:55,040
Thank you so much.

542
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,691
You have appreciated my work.

543
00:41:56,957 --> 00:42:00,446
It would've been better if
you give me a raise too accordingly.

544
00:42:00,597 --> 00:42:04,568
Actually I have been thinking about
your promotion for the last few days.

545
00:42:06,136 --> 00:42:10,136
In today's times,
it is rare to find an honest man like you.

546
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:15,892
And Anand told me that the
post of the supervisor is vacant.

547
00:42:17,028 --> 00:42:21,866
And once you become the supervisor
your salary too will increase quite a bit.

548
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,217
You also want this, right?

549
00:42:27,274 --> 00:42:32,392
But the union and stuff is
not meant for an honest man like you.

550
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:37,892
You should spend maximum
time with your family.

551
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,055
All of us want to spend
time with our families.

552
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:45,352
No one wants to get
into the union and stuff.

553
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,325
- You also don't want, right?
- Yes. Absolutely.

554
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:54,292
I knew.

555
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:59,092
I knew you would accept our demands.

556
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:05,689
You'll make the plant safe
by installing new equipment.

557
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,934
Then no one will suffer
from cancer or disease.

558
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:14,407
And nor will union form.

559
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:16,609
Why are you talking rubbish?

560
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:21,704
There is no better Chromium
Sulphate plant than ours in India.

561
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:23,975
And as far as safety
and security is concerned..

562
00:43:24,055 --> 00:43:26,921
..we are following all the
international rules and norms.

563
00:43:27,434 --> 00:43:28,867
And get this straight.

564
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:31,287
I'm in talks with Manoj
about the workers' salary.

565
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:33,569
Manoj is not the union leader anymore.

566
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,596
We're forming a new union.

567
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:39,891
Now you'll have to talk to the new union.

568
00:43:42,724 --> 00:43:47,636
First of all, thank you for coming here.

569
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:55,812
As all of us know we have formed
a new union by the name Kamdar Union.

570
00:43:56,474 --> 00:44:01,492
And today we have gathered
here to appoint its new leader.

571
00:44:01,824 --> 00:44:08,528
And all of us have decided that
our new union leader will be Jai Gohil.

572
00:44:08,716 --> 00:44:11,006
(Crowd Applauding)

573
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:17,609
So I request Jai Gohil
to put forth his views.

574
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:34,056
All of you must be knowing
all about my scooter.

575
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,819
(Laughing)

576
00:44:37,354 --> 00:44:41,393
I fill it with adulterated
petrol as it is cheap.

577
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:46,501
Then I have to clean the
carburettor every second day.

578
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:53,636
And then when even it doesn't
work then I change the gasket, Prakash.

579
00:44:58,785 --> 00:45:04,731
Even then my scooter breaks
down in the middle of the road.

580
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,893
Do you know why?

581
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:16,690
Because it's engine is faulty.

582
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:26,136
I'm not treating the
disease from its roots.

583
00:45:27,055 --> 00:45:28,960
I'm treating its symptoms.

584
00:45:31,515 --> 00:45:33,852
And Ketul too is doing the same to us.

585
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,258
He is not fixing the plant.

586
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:41,353
He keeps repairing the symptoms.

587
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,692
And what is happening.

588
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,312
The disease is growing to be fatal.

589
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,623
We are getting sick.

590
00:45:56,217 --> 00:45:57,853
We are dying.

591
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:03,892
How long do we tolerate?

592
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:08,177
Are we supposed to keep dying like this?

593
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:19,001
Now the time has come to
cure this disease from its root.

594
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:23,547
(Crowd Applauding)

595
00:46:32,149 --> 00:46:38,095
So we'll need your co-operation
to form this new union.

596
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:42,609
Show us with a raise
of hands who is with us.

597
00:46:49,198 --> 00:46:51,892
Now we have two unions in the plant.

598
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,285
And we have to vote for one between them.

599
00:46:56,444 --> 00:47:01,492
The one who wins between Jai
and Manoj will be our union leader.

600
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,689
- Kamdar.
- Union.

601
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:05,189
- Kamdar.
- Union.

602
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:06,825
- Kamdar.
- Union.

603
00:47:07,355 --> 00:47:09,458
(Crowd Applauding)

604
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:17,960
So you're back after
solving everyone's problems.

605
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,514
- What have I done?
- Don't play innocent.

606
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,946
You bring others' problems home.

607
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:28,567
Then you ask what I have done.

608
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,558
(Dishes Clattering)

609
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:32,828
What are you talking about?

610
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:34,324
What have I done?

611
00:47:34,553 --> 00:47:37,189
At least don't play innocent before me.

612
00:47:37,752 --> 00:47:40,175
Aunt Kashi has told me everything.

613
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,783
What's wrong with you?

614
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,120
Why are you getting upset?

615
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,796
All this is happening for our own good.

616
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,594
So that we meet the same fate as Digant.

617
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:57,918
Is there no one else in the plant?
You're messing with the goons.

618
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:02,174
One needs to fight for his rights.

619
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,472
You have to fight for your rights.

620
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,691
I thought you were looking
for a job somewhere.

621
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,310
The situation is the same everywhere.

622
00:48:15,921 --> 00:48:18,850
It's better you fight with people
you know rather than with unknown.

623
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:21,757
And what if they fire you from the job?

624
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:26,392
How are we you going to survive?

625
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:30,291
- I'll have to take this risk.
- What?

626
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:32,692
I'll have to take this risk.

627
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:36,635
How long do we tolerate everything meekly?

628
00:48:38,138 --> 00:48:41,946
Not anymore. Everyone is with us.

629
00:48:43,832 --> 00:48:45,797
They'll have to listen to us.

630
00:48:49,256 --> 00:48:51,891
Friends, keep calm.

631
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,023
The results of the union
elections are as follows.

632
00:48:56,103 --> 00:49:02,964
The leader of Apollo labour union
Manoj Pandey has got 16 votes in total.

633
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:11,505
And the leader of Kamdar
Union Jai Gohil has got 213 votes.

634
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,116
- Kamdar.
- Union.

635
00:49:13,196 --> 00:49:14,521
- Kamdar.
- Union.

636
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:15,891
- Kamdar.
- Union.

637
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:23,958
I declare Kamdar union
the winner in this election.

638
00:49:24,038 --> 00:49:25,673
- Kamdar.
- Union.

639
00:49:25,753 --> 00:49:28,413
- Kamdar.
- Union.

640
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:31,067
(Crowd Applauding)

641
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:46,829
Friends, I assure all of you
that I'll not let your trust break.

642
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:53,229
I'll put forth things
of your interest very soon.

643
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,840
Number one.

644
00:49:56,828 --> 00:50:02,895
All we workers should
get medical insurance.

645
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:05,835
Number two.

646
00:50:06,852 --> 00:50:12,505
We haven't got a raise in all these years.
We deserve a raise.

647
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:14,181
- Kamdar.
- Union.

648
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,540
- Kamdar.
- Union.

649
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,075
And I'll meet the labour
inspector today itself..

650
00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:22,818
..and put forward these things to him.

651
00:50:22,898 --> 00:50:24,412
- Kamdar.
- Union.

652
00:50:24,492 --> 00:50:25,975
- Kamdar.
- Union.

653
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:27,557
- Kamdar.
- Union.

654
00:50:27,637 --> 00:50:29,330
- Kamdar.
- Union.

655
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:30,747
- Kamdar.
- Union.

656
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,336
- Kamdar.
- Union.

657
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:48,403
Mr. Sumani, the safety standards
are very poor in your plant.

658
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:56,242
You need to repair air filtration
and electrical wiring immediately.

659
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:59,810
And you have to get the
health check up all the workers..

660
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:01,897
..in your workers
done in the next 30 days.

661
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:06,358
And I give you 30 days for
the comments I have made here.

662
00:52:06,566 --> 00:52:11,973
30 days. Or you'll have
to shut down the plant.

663
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:21,280
Papa, are you happy now?
I've scored 98% in the finals.

664
00:52:21,778 --> 00:52:26,146
- I'm very happy.
- Okay. On that note have some sweets.

665
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:30,590
- You also have it.
- No. I'll feed you.

666
00:52:33,616 --> 00:52:37,162
- Geeta, have it.
- Okay listen.

667
00:52:38,157 --> 00:52:40,535
Did you talk to them
about reducing the fees?

668
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:42,871
It will cost 5-6 lakhs at the least.

669
00:52:43,087 --> 00:52:45,811
People pay even 50-60
lakhs for donation seats.

670
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:49,086
But for us, even 5 lakhs is huge.

671
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:51,140
We don't have to pay
the entire amount at once.

672
00:52:51,855 --> 00:52:54,124
- 5 lakhs in 4 years, right?
- Yes.

673
00:52:54,665 --> 00:52:58,383
For us 5-6 lakhs is huge.
How are we going to arrange?

674
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,265
Have trust in God. We will manage.

675
00:53:02,537 --> 00:53:06,102
Do you remember how happy
we were before marriage?

676
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:07,833
He wasn't even born.

677
00:53:08,825 --> 00:53:10,989
And we were dreaming
of making him a doctor.

678
00:53:12,762 --> 00:53:15,195
And today when we are getting
the chance to make him a doctor..

679
00:53:15,911 --> 00:53:17,486
..then you're getting upset.

680
00:53:17,746 --> 00:53:21,227
I'm not upset.
I'm just worried about the money.

681
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:23,908
I'm glad you didn't marry that man.

682
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:24,654
Which man?

683
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:29,173
The one who came to meet
you for marriage before we eloped.

684
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:30,292
Don't talk rubbish.

685
00:53:30,372 --> 00:53:35,763
- That man's story.
- Papa, what man? Which story?

686
00:53:35,843 --> 00:53:37,940
- Ask her.
- Play along. He's playing.

687
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,249
- No. Now I want to know.
- He wants to know. Tell him.

688
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:42,968
Tell me. Please.

689
00:53:43,048 --> 00:53:45,703
Why do you bring up the past?

690
00:53:45,783 --> 00:53:49,044
Tell him. He wants to hear. Tell him.

691
00:53:49,124 --> 00:53:50,255
Tell me please.

692
00:53:50,335 --> 00:53:53,919
Nothing. I was just 16 or 17 then.

693
00:53:54,466 --> 00:53:59,176
And my parents have found
out that I was going around with him.

694
00:54:00,114 --> 00:54:03,412
So they wanted to get me married.

695
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:07,498
So this guy came to meet me. Fat guy.

696
00:54:09,953 --> 00:54:12,796
That was it. I was really unwell that day.

697
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:16,564
My stomach has aching badly.
I was suffering from gas trouble.

698
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:21,369
So I thought God knows
when he is going to stop.

699
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:23,091
He was asking so many questions.

700
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:30,147
Like this. Which food do you like?

701
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,904
Which is your favourite movie?

702
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,158
(Laughing)

703
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,055
I mean one disgusting
question after the other.

704
00:54:39,135 --> 00:54:41,606
I just wanted him to stop his questions.

705
00:54:41,686 --> 00:54:43,660
And my stomach was aching so badly.
I couldn't bear it.

706
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:49,627
So I shifted a little and I farted.

707
00:54:49,877 --> 00:54:51,828
(Laughing)

708
00:54:53,087 --> 00:54:55,520
- Then.
- I thought I had gotten away with it.

709
00:54:56,591 --> 00:55:00,202
After a while it started
to stink so badly.

710
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:02,245
The boy was looking here and there.

711
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:06,667
I was avoiding eye contact.
It was really bad.

712
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:10,342
- Even a cow farts better than this.
- He took off.

713
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:14,201
He took off and never came back.

714
00:55:14,893 --> 00:55:19,812
And then I got married to him. Happy?

715
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:21,551
Exactly. That's why I wonder..

716
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:23,007
..why the house stinks so
much when I return from school.

717
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:24,419
(Laughing)

718
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:27,891
- Rubbish.
- Sorry.

719
00:56:16,755 --> 00:56:18,118
What do you want?

720
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,663
What's the status on the raw material?

721
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:25,252
The raw material isn't arriving.

722
00:56:25,332 --> 00:56:27,155
And we have just two sacks left.

723
00:56:27,904 --> 00:56:29,717
- Just two sacks?
- Yes.

724
00:56:33,501 --> 00:56:36,301
- What's going on?
- What?

725
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:38,366
There is no raw material.
There is no production happening.

726
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:40,247
Or maintenance.

727
00:56:40,327 --> 00:56:41,663
Machines are not being repaired.

728
00:56:41,743 --> 00:56:45,404
I know nothing about this.
Talk to Ketul sir.

729
00:56:46,755 --> 00:56:50,366
The workers' health check-up.
What the status on it?

730
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,263
- Is it going to happen?
- Like I said.

731
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:56,127
I know nothing about this.

732
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:14,441
How is he going to reach by morning?
He has left just now at 8 pm.

733
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:19,501
Yes. Yes. Okay.

734
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:23,987
And this will be our last consignment.

735
00:57:26,873 --> 00:57:28,603
Yes. Alright.

736
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:41,964
- We had made a deal.
- Deal? What deal?

737
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,380
What the labour inspector...

738
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,315
Okay. Okay. You're talking
about the labour inspection.

739
00:57:50,656 --> 00:57:54,850
I can't do anything. I don't have money..

740
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:59,092
..and I can't afford your useless demands.

741
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:03,694
In that case the plant will shut down.

742
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:06,050
Let it get shut down.

743
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:10,439
You're responsible for this. You.

744
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:15,099
You compelled me.
Go ahead. Form another union.

745
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:22,169
After today neither do
you guys have work nor do I.

746
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,082
I will shut down the plant in two days.

747
00:58:31,368 --> 00:58:32,557
Until when?

748
00:58:40,152 --> 00:58:41,400
For good.

749
00:58:58,264 --> 00:59:00,394
I've ruined everyone's lives.

750
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:06,292
- It's not your fault.
- It is. It is my fault.

751
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:09,691
You gave Ketul a chance to change.

752
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:13,389
But he went back to his old ways again.

753
00:59:13,752 --> 00:59:15,065
How?

754
00:59:15,145 --> 00:59:19,303
He was once put under pressure
like this before you joined.

755
00:59:20,546 --> 00:59:23,421
He shut down the plant in
order to evade the legal orders.

756
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,064
But...

757
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:30,291
The workers scattered after a few months.

758
00:59:30,878 --> 00:59:33,929
So he hired them back
and started the plant.

759
00:59:34,729 --> 00:59:36,956
This is how you got the job.

760
00:59:41,388 --> 00:59:46,728
But isn't shutting down
the plant disadvantageous to him?

761
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:48,825
No. It's advantageous to him.

762
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:52,717
He'll save on billions that he
would have to spend to fulfil our demands.

763
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,692
The officials can be bought for 4-5 lakhs.

764
00:59:58,307 --> 01:00:00,653
Then he'll also save on the
money required to repair the plant.

765
01:00:02,923 --> 01:00:05,323
This is cheaper deal for him.

766
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:07,745
What will be of us
till the plant restarts?

767
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:10,198
How are we going to survive?

768
01:00:58,182 --> 01:01:00,479
Where had you been till so late?

769
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,787
What happened?

770
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:08,230
The plant is shutting down.

771
01:01:16,004 --> 01:01:16,911
What?

772
01:01:18,552 --> 01:01:20,155
The plant is shutting down, Geeta.

773
01:01:22,663 --> 01:01:24,793
I knew this was going to happen.

774
01:01:27,414 --> 01:01:29,193
That is why I was stopping you.

775
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,733
Good luck with your politics now.

776
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:37,491
You just pay heed to me.

777
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:41,745
What are we going to do now?

778
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:51,271
Do as you please.

779
01:02:03,897 --> 01:02:06,925
Do you remember?
I had promised you before marriage.

780
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:11,703
I don't want to hear anything.

781
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:15,891
That I'll give you a good life.

782
01:02:17,554 --> 01:02:18,828
I never could.

783
01:02:20,751 --> 01:02:24,093
You ran the house with a
meagre salary without complaining.

784
01:02:27,629 --> 01:02:30,612
Nothing has changed
even after so many years.

785
01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:36,071
The situation went from bad to worse.

786
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:45,077
I wanted to fix everything, Geeta.
(Crying)

787
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:49,218
I wanted to fix everything.

788
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:52,904
I'm sorry.

789
01:02:55,953 --> 01:02:57,834
I'm sorry.

790
01:03:01,034 --> 01:03:02,926
I'm sorry, Geeta.

791
01:03:10,201 --> 01:03:12,212
I'm sorry.

792
01:03:16,427 --> 01:03:20,692
Stop. Stop crying. Enough.

793
01:03:40,298 --> 01:03:42,061
Who is it so late?

794
01:03:44,569 --> 01:03:45,575
Hello.

795
01:04:15,548 --> 01:04:18,782
(Birds Chirping)

796
01:04:21,749 --> 01:04:24,007
I find it very hard to spend my days.

797
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:28,655
Why don't you guys move in here?

798
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:34,137
Aunt, you'll also get
bothered along with us.

799
01:04:34,498 --> 01:04:37,359
There is nothing left in my life.

800
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:43,975
The one who should have
been my companion is gone.

801
01:04:44,226 --> 01:04:46,682
(Crying)

802
01:04:47,158 --> 01:04:53,455
Aunt Kashi, we are with you. Always.

803
01:04:55,547 --> 01:04:58,190
You're the only family I have.

804
01:05:05,356 --> 01:05:09,542
Papa, moving in to someone
else's house feels a little strange.

805
01:05:09,622 --> 01:05:13,401
It is not someone else's house.
It is also our house.

806
01:05:24,214 --> 01:05:25,491
Sir, please get us justice.

807
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:29,165
Everyone's salary for months is pending.

808
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:33,013
People are sick.
No one has work. Or money.

809
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:38,138
Moreover he has shut down the
plant fearing the medical check-up.

810
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,986
According to the records we have..

811
01:05:42,066 --> 01:05:45,586
..the medical check-up of the workers
at Apollo chemicals happens regularly.

812
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:47,092
Sir, this report is false.

813
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:50,181
Ketul Somani has submitted
the wrong report.

814
01:05:50,753 --> 01:05:53,704
We can't take any action against
any company without any proof.

815
01:05:54,093 --> 01:05:56,504
If what you're saying
is true then do this.

816
01:05:57,229 --> 01:05:59,467
File a complaint against
the company in writing.

817
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,553
List all the problems.
And get the workers' signatures on it.

818
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:06,291
If the complaint turns out to be right..

819
01:06:06,959 --> 01:06:08,959
..then we'll surely take
action against the company.

820
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:15,992
(Knock On Door)

821
01:06:23,617 --> 01:06:24,261
Iqbal, the...

822
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:29,522
I have lost my livelihood and bread
and butter thanks to your union stuff.

823
01:06:29,734 --> 01:06:34,960
Try to understand. The government will
take action only if we stick together.

824
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,749
And the new labour inspector
Parmar sir is helping us.

825
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,089
Excuse me.

826
01:06:42,376 --> 01:06:43,171
(Door Closes)

827
01:07:29,036 --> 01:07:35,630
I have told him so many
times to consult a good doctor.

828
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:42,635
I can't bear to see his condition.

829
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:53,014
Talk to him once.

830
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:56,691
Take him to some good doctor.

831
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,906
Go.

832
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,982
What are you thinking?

833
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,058
Nothing.

834
01:08:32,714 --> 01:08:34,279
What are you thinking, Harsh?

835
01:08:35,093 --> 01:08:40,906
I was thinking of getting
admission in BSC and not in medical.

836
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:43,273
What rubbish.

837
01:08:43,895 --> 01:08:45,717
It will be less costly.

838
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:50,269
Lots of people pursue BSC.
It is quite a good career option.

839
01:08:58,992 --> 01:09:05,404
I...I spent all that money on your
school and tuition so that you pursue BSC.

840
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:07,956
Why did you lie to me?

841
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:15,134
Lie. You said you were
going to get a raise.

842
01:09:17,123 --> 01:09:19,285
And you'll be able to bear
the expense of the medical stream.

843
01:09:19,514 --> 01:09:24,918
I will manage it.
Your fees for medical will be arranged.

844
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:29,382
Right now my fees for
medical is not important.

845
01:09:32,258 --> 01:09:34,117
You need good treatment.

846
01:09:34,874 --> 01:09:38,312
What's wrong with me? Yes?

847
01:09:40,842 --> 01:09:43,545
You hide your problems so easily.

848
01:09:46,871 --> 01:09:49,210
I'm just a kid. I understand nothing.

849
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:52,280
That's not the case.

850
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:57,414
It won't matter if
become a doctor or don't.

851
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:03,631
But it does matter
to us if you're unhealthy.

852
01:10:08,041 --> 01:10:11,965
No. I will not pursue MBBS.

853
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:22,139
After all the hard
work for all these years..

854
01:10:25,637 --> 01:10:28,387
..you're breaking my dream so easily.

855
01:10:40,993 --> 01:10:46,431
Papa. I...I didn't mean to say that.

856
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:52,533
For me, nothing is more
than you in this world.

857
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,692
You don't believe me, isn't it?

858
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:07,598
Then tell me. What can I do to prove it?

859
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:18,159
Get admission in the medical stream.

860
01:11:42,982 --> 01:11:46,150
- Any progress?
- No. Only 12 have signed.

861
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:48,777
But I explained to everyone.
But no one's ready to listen.

862
01:11:48,857 --> 01:11:50,096
It's okay.

863
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:53,264
No one's ready to understand.
Everyone's dumb.

864
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,933
Actually everyone is scared.

865
01:11:57,295 --> 01:11:59,091
It will take time.
But everyone will relent.

866
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:03,620
Well, did you speak to Vimla?

867
01:12:03,942 --> 01:12:07,522
- Actually I had an upset tummy this morning...
- It means you haven't.

868
01:12:08,952 --> 01:12:12,409
Okay. Let's talk to Vimla.

869
01:12:14,928 --> 01:12:17,274
What's the point in doing all this now?

870
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:19,944
He died of cancer.

871
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,226
Now he won't come back, will he?

872
01:12:23,066 --> 01:12:25,058
It was our bad luck.

873
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:28,389
Don't curse your luck.

874
01:12:30,198 --> 01:12:33,405
We want to prove that he
lost his life because of the plant.

875
01:12:34,973 --> 01:12:38,757
You...Give. Sign this.

876
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:43,978
The company gave me 50000 on his death.

877
01:12:44,454 --> 01:12:46,692
What if it ask me to return?

878
01:12:46,772 --> 01:12:48,357
They can't ask you to return.

879
01:12:49,135 --> 01:12:52,876
50,000 is a really meagre sum.
You'll get even more.

880
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:58,767
Yes. But I don't understand...

881
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:02,216
I don't want to get
into the legal hassles.

882
01:13:02,354 --> 01:13:03,784
This won't be a court case.

883
01:13:03,864 --> 01:13:06,173
- How many people have signed?
- 12.

884
01:13:06,253 --> 01:13:11,373
12 have already.
Sign it. Everything's going to be alright.

885
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,887
I'm a lone woman.

886
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:19,935
Don't get me into any legal hassle.

887
01:13:20,411 --> 01:13:23,438
No. Everything's going to be alright.

888
01:13:25,135 --> 01:13:26,541
Sign it.

889
01:13:29,016 --> 01:13:34,691
I understand your problem.
My situation too is like yours.

890
01:13:38,735 --> 01:13:44,691
If I knew that these people
are going to shut down the plant..

891
01:13:46,637 --> 01:13:48,745
..then I would've never
spoken about health and safety.

892
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:58,972
Even if Prakash dies of cancer.
And I die of urinating blood.

893
01:13:59,052 --> 01:14:01,058
And you die of chromium dust inhalation.

894
01:14:03,133 --> 01:14:04,766
Dying doesn't make any difference to us.

895
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:08,528
Losing the job does.

896
01:14:18,852 --> 01:14:26,052
Satish Parmar is a good labour inspector.

897
01:14:28,366 --> 01:14:30,755
He wants to help us.

898
01:14:31,392 --> 01:14:36,138
He has said that if
we sign this petition..

899
01:14:37,403 --> 01:14:39,891
..then the government will
take action against Apollo chemicals.

900
01:14:41,035 --> 01:14:43,089
They'll have to start the plant again.

901
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:48,112
They'll have to hire us.
With our demands at that.

902
01:14:50,764 --> 01:14:52,408
Now you guys decide.

903
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:55,964
Do you wish to die by putting up a fight?

904
01:14:58,784 --> 01:15:00,527
Or die of suffering.

905
01:15:01,233 --> 01:15:03,869
(Crowd Applauding)

906
01:15:14,532 --> 01:15:15,535
(Phone Ringing)

907
01:15:26,703 --> 01:15:27,575
(Glass Bottle Break)

908
01:15:29,965 --> 01:15:32,927
You have become the union leader.
Darn you.

909
01:15:33,007 --> 01:15:34,970
Who the hell is it? Here.

910
01:15:35,607 --> 01:15:38,764
You're going to be he union leader.

911
01:15:42,763 --> 01:15:45,099
Do you want me to shoot you down?

912
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:47,597
I'll fire so many
bullets in our backside..

913
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,492
..that you'll never able
to go to the toilet again.

914
01:15:51,890 --> 01:15:53,198
Got it?

915
01:15:58,733 --> 01:16:02,030
Sir, someone called Jai
Gohil has come to see you.

916
01:16:06,282 --> 01:16:11,091
Do this. Tell him that
I'm out of town for a few days.

917
01:16:15,281 --> 01:16:17,976
Sir is out of town. Come later.

918
01:16:51,783 --> 01:16:53,598
- Have you fixed it?
- Yes, Rita madam?

919
01:16:53,678 --> 01:16:57,760
But the oil is leaking slightly.
And there is slight suspension problem.

920
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,938
Is it?

921
01:17:00,571 --> 01:17:01,933
I'll have to dismantle the entire car.

922
01:17:02,264 --> 01:17:05,274
No. Check it next time.
I'll not be able to afford it at once.

923
01:17:08,168 --> 01:17:13,858
I've fixed the brakes.
Come. Let's have a test drive.

924
01:17:15,432 --> 01:17:17,026
The brake is not making any noise, right?

925
01:17:19,187 --> 01:17:21,728
Get the engine oil
leakage repaired quickly.

926
01:17:22,994 --> 01:17:24,474
Or the car could conk out.

927
01:17:25,514 --> 01:17:27,025
How much would that cost?

928
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:30,895
Around 30000-40000.

929
01:17:32,261 --> 01:17:34,041
I'll have to dismantle the entire car.

930
01:17:35,446 --> 01:17:38,311
You work with Prakash
uncle at the plant, right?

931
01:17:38,819 --> 01:17:40,376
Still you'll charge me so much.

932
01:17:42,552 --> 01:17:44,483
Okay. Pay only for the parts.

933
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:48,364
- I'll manage the rest.
- Thank you.

934
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:51,023
Just pull up. Thank you.

935
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:57,424
Bala. Where are you going?

936
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:00,255
We have to meet certain people?
Did you talk to Parmar sir?

937
01:18:02,948 --> 01:18:04,451
He is not picking up my call.

938
01:18:04,531 --> 01:18:06,202
Looks like he too has been bought.

939
01:18:06,422 --> 01:18:08,289
All of them are fooling us.

940
01:18:08,993 --> 01:18:10,300
We'll have to do something soon.

941
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,781
Everyone's cursing us.

942
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:15,652
Okay. I'll go to his office again.

943
01:18:16,354 --> 01:18:18,291
- Let me see what he says.
- Okay.

944
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:27,251
Is everything alright?

945
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,786
I ran tests on all the workers.

946
01:18:35,467 --> 01:18:37,121
They have been treated very badly.

947
01:18:39,143 --> 01:18:41,586
You're the first person to say so.

948
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,691
Or people think we are crazy.

949
01:18:46,148 --> 01:18:48,884
Ketul and my clinic's
owner are very good friends.

950
01:18:50,637 --> 01:18:53,078
And that's why we are
often told to show the..

951
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:55,030
..workers' blood reports to be normal.

952
01:18:58,462 --> 01:19:01,132
And we have to do it out
of fear of losing our jobs.

953
01:19:04,796 --> 01:19:06,292
Prakash's...

954
01:19:12,017 --> 01:19:16,179
Every worker who comes from
the plant has the chromium problem.

955
01:19:17,238 --> 01:19:19,594
There was a lot of chromium
in uncle's blood as well..

956
01:19:21,605 --> 01:19:23,508
..which we had to show
as normal in the report.

957
01:19:24,611 --> 01:19:25,767
Darn it.

958
01:19:28,822 --> 01:19:30,719
Can you give me the real reports?

959
01:19:31,994 --> 01:19:33,811
You'll do me a huge favour.

960
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:37,492
I can try.

961
01:19:39,421 --> 01:19:41,281
But my name shouldn't figure anywhere.

962
01:19:42,805 --> 01:19:47,465
Don't worry at all. I won't tell anyone.

963
01:19:51,508 --> 01:19:54,048
Sir. Parmar sir. Sir.

964
01:19:54,449 --> 01:19:55,876
I've been doing the rounds for days now.

965
01:19:55,956 --> 01:19:57,021
I guess you were out of town.

966
01:19:57,101 --> 01:19:59,821
You said you need all the
worker's signs on this application.

967
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:01,357
Everyone has signed.

968
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,335
Come some other time. I'm busy today.

969
01:20:03,415 --> 01:20:08,016
Sir, take it.
See. Everyone has signed. As you said.

970
01:20:08,222 --> 01:20:10,243
All the workers have signed.

971
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:17,952
Look, the problem is that
such cases are time consuming.

972
01:20:19,029 --> 01:20:20,692
How much longer is it going to take?

973
01:20:21,222 --> 01:20:26,135
Years. There are thousands
of cases pending.

974
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:31,226
I suggest you meet Ketul
Somani and arrive at a compromise.

975
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:33,161
That will be in everyone's interest.

976
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:40,491
We tried so many times. But what happened?

977
01:20:42,207 --> 01:20:44,036
Hence we are complaining.

978
01:20:44,684 --> 01:20:47,474
The action will not be taken so soon.
It will take a lot of time.

979
01:20:48,823 --> 01:20:50,999
No one's going to touch the file.

980
01:20:51,826 --> 01:20:53,215
What are you going to do till then?

981
01:20:54,407 --> 01:20:57,669
Jai, why are you wasting time?
Yours and mine.

982
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:00,826
I have a meeting to attend.

983
01:21:03,323 --> 01:21:05,355
This...What do I do with this?

984
01:21:07,853 --> 01:21:08,999
I'll keep it.

985
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:14,286
But nothing's going
to happen anytime soon.

986
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:17,951
What will be of us?

987
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:21,378
As I told you.
Compromise is the only option.

988
01:21:22,276 --> 01:21:23,755
Compromise.

989
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:09,849
What will be of Geeta?

990
01:22:12,451 --> 01:22:14,494
She'll not be able to bear it.

991
01:22:17,376 --> 01:22:19,612
Harsh has worked really hard.
(Crying)

992
01:22:21,672 --> 01:22:24,121
He wants to be a doctor, Lord.

993
01:22:32,129 --> 01:22:38,785
Don't do that. Don't do that.

994
01:22:40,811 --> 01:22:43,970
Don't...

995
01:22:44,952 --> 01:22:47,091
Don't...

996
01:22:52,153 --> 01:22:54,561
I'm sorry.

997
01:23:25,169 --> 01:23:28,513
You said the blood will stop. But still...

998
01:23:28,593 --> 01:23:32,533
It's okay. Does it burn while urinating?

999
01:23:32,952 --> 01:23:34,476
It is intense.

1000
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:37,347
Sometimes it takes longer
for the medicines to work.

1001
01:23:37,575 --> 01:23:40,658
- It's a kidney problem.
- Is it cancer?

1002
01:23:40,853 --> 01:23:43,530
No. This is a simple kidney problem.

1003
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,540
Your lungs are clear.

1004
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,550
I've prescribe a different medicine.

1005
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:51,436
- Perhaps this...
- Perhaps? Perhaps?

1006
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,750
I've been urinating
blood for the last 6 months.

1007
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:55,760
And you're saying perhaps.

1008
01:23:57,136 --> 01:23:59,780
Do you even know what's wrong with me?

1009
01:23:59,999 --> 01:24:03,892
If you have such a problem
then go consult someone else.

1010
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:13,903
Here's the copy of
the original blood reports.

1011
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:17,315
Keep them safely.
It has uncle Prakash's report too.

1012
01:24:21,995 --> 01:24:23,091
Come.

1013
01:24:31,825 --> 01:24:34,900
Lift your hand. Roll it up.

1014
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,380
The doctor has prescribed
lots of tests for you.

1015
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,795
Urine, sputum, blood.

1016
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:46,488
Give me your hand.

1017
01:24:48,701 --> 01:24:50,644
Since when have you been urinating blood?

1018
01:24:51,438 --> 01:24:54,141
- 6-7 months.
- And you're coming now?

1019
01:24:59,534 --> 01:25:01,301
It's okay. It's okay.

1020
01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:09,579
Bend your hand. Hold it there.

1021
01:25:15,558 --> 01:25:17,298
Two reports of the same blood report.

1022
01:25:17,585 --> 01:25:20,525
One real and one fake.

1023
01:25:24,477 --> 01:25:27,703
Now we can destroy Ketul's world.

1024
01:25:28,053 --> 01:25:33,210
But how? The labour inspector
too has been bought.

1025
01:25:34,392 --> 01:25:37,061
Now we don't need that labour inspector.

1026
01:25:38,058 --> 01:25:39,892
Let's do this.

1027
01:25:40,794 --> 01:25:45,288
Let's go to the police station
and file a murder complaint against Ketul.

1028
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:48,159
How? How is that going to help?

1029
01:25:48,784 --> 01:25:51,892
Do we have money to fight the case?

1030
01:25:53,277 --> 01:25:59,092
We need to find a lawyer
who charges us after the case.

1031
01:26:02,332 --> 01:26:06,876
It's difficult.
It's difficult to find such a lawyer.

1032
01:26:08,362 --> 01:26:13,793
And even if we find
one Ketul will buy him too.

1033
01:26:15,019 --> 01:26:21,555
I have a relative.
Aunt's son. He has just completed LLB.

1034
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:24,376
And he is looked for a job.

1035
01:26:25,445 --> 01:26:27,891
He might be able to help us.

1036
01:26:34,073 --> 01:26:37,492
- Good idea.
- But he doesn't have much experience.

1037
01:26:40,004 --> 01:26:45,086
We need honesty and not experience.

1038
01:26:48,278 --> 01:26:50,542
The original blood report of the diseased.

1039
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:55,761
I too have been urinating
blood for a while now.

1040
01:26:56,167 --> 01:27:00,981
The way you've been
treated is really wrong.

1041
01:27:02,856 --> 01:27:04,832
I will help you completely.

1042
01:27:05,947 --> 01:27:07,941
We want justice.

1043
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:17,383
- Ketul should be in jail. Darn it.
- I'll try my best.

1044
01:27:41,741 --> 01:27:45,254
Come. Come, Jai. After a long time.

1045
01:27:46,352 --> 01:27:48,565
Come. Let's have tea.

1046
01:27:50,389 --> 01:27:52,450
You've become quite weak.

1047
01:27:53,599 --> 01:27:56,335
Have you got your son
admitted to the medical stream?

1048
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,136
- Will be done.
- The study is very expensive.

1049
01:28:01,322 --> 01:28:04,190
- It will cost at least 6-7 lakhs.
- Come to the point.

1050
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,795
What have you come to say?

1051
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:07,349
I have an offer.

1052
01:28:07,755 --> 01:28:09,393
You'll get 10 lakh rupees.

1053
01:28:10,559 --> 01:28:17,096
Ketul sir wants to resolves
the issues between us amicably.

1054
01:28:17,890 --> 01:28:20,964
We'll reinstate all the workers.
The plant will also restart.

1055
01:28:22,332 --> 01:28:24,241
This is a really good opportunity.

1056
01:28:24,882 --> 01:28:27,686
Your life will change.

1057
01:28:29,646 --> 01:28:31,521
So what do you say?

1058
01:28:36,775 --> 01:28:39,292
Now I'll discuss this with
the one who is going to give me money.

1059
01:28:49,939 --> 01:28:51,892
Fix a meeting with Ketul.

1060
01:29:03,008 --> 01:29:04,562
So you're here.

1061
01:29:07,146 --> 01:29:09,241
I've been waiting for you since long.

1062
01:29:09,321 --> 01:29:11,092
Why? Do you have some other appointment?

1063
01:29:11,352 --> 01:29:16,369
No. No. I have come here to meet you only.

1064
01:29:19,241 --> 01:29:20,691
So let's get to the point.

1065
01:29:24,917 --> 01:29:28,869
Here's the medical report of the workers
who died while working in your plant.

1066
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:37,113
So? Everything it in is normal.

1067
01:29:37,489 --> 01:29:39,173
It's normal?

1068
01:29:41,398 --> 01:29:42,856
So what's this?

1069
01:29:44,952 --> 01:29:46,909
This is not normal.

1070
01:29:49,055 --> 01:29:51,160
Chromium is 15-20% higher.

1071
01:29:54,552 --> 01:29:56,692
Do you understand what this means?

1072
01:29:58,548 --> 01:30:03,891
Cancer. Disease. Death.

1073
01:30:05,913 --> 01:30:10,676
Now shall we discuss what we have met for?

1074
01:30:11,774 --> 01:30:13,243
So what are we doing?

1075
01:30:13,503 --> 01:30:15,237
Look, I've not prepared it.

1076
01:30:16,493 --> 01:30:19,206
Go meet the one who has prepared it.
Tell him.

1077
01:30:20,372 --> 01:30:22,281
Why are you wasting my time?

1078
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:24,156
Alright.

1079
01:30:24,798 --> 01:30:29,983
Then I'll lodge an FIR against the
doctor who has prepared this fake report.

1080
01:30:30,996 --> 01:30:33,294
I've heard he is your friend.

1081
01:30:35,777 --> 01:30:38,598
I came here thinking
I'll withdraw the FIR.

1082
01:30:40,152 --> 01:30:42,292
No issues. I'll file another FIR.

1083
01:30:43,311 --> 01:30:44,966
Just a minute.

1084
01:30:46,554 --> 01:30:48,665
How much do you want?

1085
01:30:51,952 --> 01:30:53,935
Now you're talking business.

1086
01:30:55,860 --> 01:31:01,492
So also accept that five innocent workers
have lost their lives because of you.

1087
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:06,113
You want money, right?
So why are you talking rubbish?

1088
01:31:09,884 --> 01:31:12,566
Okay. We'll give you
as much money as you want.

1089
01:31:13,123 --> 01:31:14,779
How much do you want?

1090
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:20,218
5 lakhs for one death.

1091
01:31:25,353 --> 01:31:28,394
25 lakhs in total for 5 deaths.

1092
01:31:31,739 --> 01:31:33,242
Done.

1093
01:31:34,137 --> 01:31:36,062
Give him the money.

1094
01:31:49,044 --> 01:31:51,654
Do you understand status quo?

1095
01:31:53,782 --> 01:31:57,245
Status quo means you'll
perish if you don't change.

1096
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:01,772
The entire world has changed.
But you haven't changed, Ketul.

1097
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:05,200
We tried so hard to change you.

1098
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:16,755
But you're like the rigid fool..

1099
01:32:18,269 --> 01:32:20,336
..who just doesn't want
to come out of the status quo.

1100
01:32:20,539 --> 01:32:22,380
What nonsense.

1101
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:32,691
25 lakhs in total for 5 deaths.

1102
01:32:36,502 --> 01:32:37,988
Done.

1103
01:32:38,889 --> 01:32:40,336
Give him the money.

1104
01:32:43,901 --> 01:32:46,164
Your game is over, Ketul.

1105
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:56,079
Manoj, listen to me.

1106
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,917
It's an emergency. Jai has cheated us.

1107
01:32:59,863 --> 01:33:01,941
Find him.

1108
01:33:24,053 --> 01:33:26,942
Darn it. Have you gone crazy?

1109
01:33:29,576 --> 01:33:32,127
You are acting very smart.

1110
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:36,721
Talk. Talk now. Talk now.

1111
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:41,840
Run. Run.

1112
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:48,765
Call the ambulance. Quick.

1113
01:33:58,647 --> 01:34:01,492
Hello. I'm Dr. Joshi.

1114
01:34:04,266 --> 01:34:06,292
You seem better than before.

1115
01:34:07,025 --> 01:34:10,809
The stabbing has damaged
your left kidney quite a bit.

1116
01:34:11,671 --> 01:34:14,120
Now you'll have to be here for a few days.

1117
01:34:14,897 --> 01:34:16,738
And we had run some additional tests..

1118
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:21,282
..which have shown that
there is cancer in your kidney.

1119
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:24,948
Were you aware of it?

1120
01:34:27,752 --> 01:34:32,692
Don't worry. Cancer is in the first stage.
It can be cured.

1121
01:34:34,576 --> 01:34:38,427
You'll be absolutely fine. Take care.

1122
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:51,553
Taking into consideration
all the proofs produced..

1123
01:34:51,742 --> 01:34:56,668
..the court has arrived at
the decision that Ketul Somani..

1124
01:34:56,748 --> 01:35:01,491
..and Anand Dixit purposely
gave rise to circumstances..

1125
01:35:01,775 --> 01:35:05,015
..which cost five workers their lives.

1126
01:35:05,095 --> 01:35:09,288
Along with that they
are also found guilty of..

1127
01:35:09,368 --> 01:35:14,390
..cheating, bribery and tampering
with legal and medical documents.

1128
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:18,646
And the court orders the
police to investigate their roles..

1129
01:35:18,726 --> 01:35:27,228
..in Digant Patil's murder
and the attempt to murder on Jai Gohil.

1130
01:35:27,403 --> 01:35:31,146
Manoj Pandey who carried
out Digant Patil's murder..

1131
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:33,781
..and attempt to murder on Jai Gohil..

1132
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:37,970
..be hereby arrested as soon as possible.

1133
01:35:38,392 --> 01:35:43,443
And the court orders Ketul
Somani to sell the plant and company.

1134
01:35:43,983 --> 01:35:46,669
The first part of the
money from it be hereby..

1135
01:35:46,749 --> 01:35:51,094
..used for the treatment
of the needy workers of the plant.

1136
01:35:51,174 --> 01:35:55,097
The second part be given
to the families of the deceased.

1137
01:35:55,317 --> 01:35:59,405
And the third and final part
be divided among all the workers..

1138
01:35:59,485 --> 01:36:03,892
..on the basis of their
positions in the company.

1139
01:36:04,227 --> 01:36:11,955
This court orders the new
owner to reinstate all the workers.

1140
01:36:12,035 --> 01:36:18,070
And to run the company
under statutory act 1948.

1141
01:36:18,294 --> 01:36:22,211
In the future complying
with the labour laws..

1142
01:36:22,454 --> 01:36:27,513
..proper attention be paid
to the worker's safety and facilities..

1143
01:36:27,727 --> 01:36:34,486
..so that such tragic
events don't happen again.

1144
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:36,687
(Crowd Applauding)

1145
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:41,517
- Very good.
- Great job.

1146
01:36:54,638 --> 01:36:57,819
What I was saying is that sign the
papers only after you check the points.

1147
01:36:57,899 --> 01:37:00,454
Jai, someone has come to see you.

1148
01:37:00,893 --> 01:37:03,140
- Who?
- See for yourself.

1149
01:37:10,857 --> 01:37:11,757
(Knock On Door)

1150
01:37:23,715 --> 01:37:25,492
Hey Harsh.

1151
01:37:26,435 --> 01:37:29,036
- You are here early morning.
- Surprise.

1152
01:37:29,116 --> 01:37:30,927
Surprise.

1153
01:37:34,212 --> 01:37:37,937
Papa. New shirt. New cabin.

1154
01:37:38,017 --> 01:37:39,711
You've become the boss.

1155
01:37:40,437 --> 01:37:42,092
And you'll become a doctor.

1156
01:37:46,721 --> 01:37:48,782
How are your studies going?

1157
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:53,343
- Great.
- Great.

1158
01:37:57,391 --> 01:37:59,694
- And Gandhi's ashram?
- Good.

1159
01:38:00,252 --> 01:38:01,941
Status quo.

1160
01:38:02,121 --> 01:38:04,249
(Laughing)
