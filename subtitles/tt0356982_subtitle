2
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,475
I used to be afraid of him

3
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:37,459
We all used to be afraid of him

4
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:41,562
I met him at the college

5
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,212
He was.. He was a big shot there.

6
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:50,032
He would sing at the college functions..,
and I used to play the drums

7
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:54,588
When I flunked the third year,
the hostel people chucked me out.

8
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,640
So did my folks at home.

9
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,596
I had nowhere to stay, and I was broke.

10
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:04,220
He had his own place, so..
he asked me to tag along.

11
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,695
"How old is this building?"

12
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:26,931
"How will that information be relevant
to you? huh?" "Come.."

13
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,388
-"How many more steps to go?"
-"Plenty. Keep up"

14
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,990
"Isn't there a lift in here?"
-"Oh yes there is.

15
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:42,243
But its turned off by 7 PM"
-"Why so?"

16
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:46,151
"Because they have to restart it again
at 8:30 AM That's why"

17
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,863
-"So to come down, do we
have to use the staircase again"

18
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:53,313
"There's the balcony of course.
You can leap from there"

19
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,162
"What is that?"

20
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:19,342
"The world's biggest trash can"

21
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:24,351
"Don't lean over like that,
you gonna fall over. Come.."

22
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,414
"HEY FATSO.. !
FATSO!"

23
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,492
"HEY CHICKEN..!"

24
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,687
"Fatso ...
Faaatso"

25
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:42,069
"Hey Fatso..
What are you watching.. Huh?"

26
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,666
"Juhi Chawla"

27
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,515
"Can you actually see her"
-"I see her as inverted"

28
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:51,707
"So un-invert her"

29
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,600
"She is wearing a skirt mate.."
-"Know what I am gonna do to the skirt... "

30
00:07:57,222 --> 00:08:00,046
"Hey Chicken.. cluk cluk..
what are you reading huh?"

31
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:07,560
"This here.. is your bunk.
Got it?"

32
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:15,571
"So finally here eh?" -"Yeah mate"
"What did your pop say back home..?"

33
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:21,985
"Is this why we sent you to study.."

34
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,129
"And listen up.."

35
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,992
"This is my room."

36
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:32,463
"Don't even peek inside
without permission"

37
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,316
"Enjoy"

38
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:41,405
His mother was from Mumbai.
His father from Goa.

39
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,576
Both had separated.

40
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:46,901
The house was on his mother's name,
she died later.

41
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,057
We all stayed at his place only.

42
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:53,754
..as we didn't had to pay any rent.
It was because of him that we used to get work.

43
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:57,670
He would take care of the money matters.
We all did what Luke would tell us to.

44
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,519
One room at his place was his..

45
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,410
The other was taken by us.

46
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:10,432
I joined him First. Then came Joy,
and then Pondy.

47
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:14,189
"He would always have issues with Pondy."
"He was an a**hole.. That is why."

48
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,132
"Keep a check on the language."

49
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:20,820
You all stayed together..
What would you do for a living?

50
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,908
"Why did you hit me?"

51
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,332
"Is this is how you gonna play?"
-"But why did you hit me?"

52
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,384
"So should I wave down to you? huh?"

53
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,314
"Why are you staring at me?"
"Huh?"

54
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:41,466
"Lower your gaze..
DOWN!"

55
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:49,660
"Go. Prepare a joint"

56
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:54,935
"Pondy.. I am telling this to you.
Go and prepare a joint"

57
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:07,703
"What are you staring at?"

58
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:42,499
"Hey Joy.. Go n check up
why Shiuli hasn't arrived yet"

59
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,257
"I will see to it"

60
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,043
"What are you laughing at huh?"
-"Sit down you Dick. I'll see to it"

61
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:50,793
"Don't call me Dick like that."
-"So what should I call you ?"

62
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:52,994
"That is my name"
-"And what is your name Pondy"

63
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:55,706
"Luke, Don't come in between on this"
-"I'm actually behind you Pondy"

64
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:58,477
"Hey buzz off!"
-"Look how he snapped on the
mention of that babe"

65
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:02,361
"Don't call Shiuli a babe"
-"shouldn't call Shiuli a babe, or him a nut,
the what should I call em.. do tell"

66
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,875
"Look.. stay away from me."

67
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:05,836
"Otherwise there'll be problems here"

68
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:08,690
Problem!

69
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:13,294
"Hey get off my back!"

70
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:17,104
"Pondy will create problems..
Pondy will create problems"

71
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,979
"Hey Pondy, forget about Shiuli,"

72
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:22,059
"look I too have hair like her"
- "Scoot!"

73
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:32,253
"Hi Shiuli"

74
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,786
"Get lost you"

75
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,936
That all was what we had for life.

76
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,837
NIkhil.
Our friend.

77
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,961
The place where we practiced
all day was his father's godown.

78
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:53,670
His father was loaded.
But he himself was a pauper.

79
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,325
He even had to ask around
for his fix of booze.

80
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:59,329
He would attend all our shows..
Would be there on all our rehearsals.

81
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:38,802


82
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:47,104


83
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:51,525


84
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:55,298


85
00:13:56,321 --> 00:14:00,387


86
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:04,501


87
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:08,828


88
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:13,476


89
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:17,227


90
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:21,863


91
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:26,437


92
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:31,445


93
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:59,189


94
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:04,000


95
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,451


96
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:14,737


97
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:19,320


98
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,537


99
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,804


100
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:29,065


101
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:33,435


102
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:36,158


103
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:39,078


104
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:43,416


105
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:47,215


106
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,117


107
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,880


108
00:15:56,008 --> 00:16:00,910


109
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:27,880


110
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:34,876


111
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,941


112
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:40,179


113
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:46,339


114
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,981


115
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:55,076


116
00:16:55,358 --> 00:16:59,557


117
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:04,182


118
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:08,370


119
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:12,036


120
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:16,774


121
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:21,122


122
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,524


123
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:29,723


124
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:32,369


125
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:15,971
"Hey Pondy.."

126
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:23,090
"Want some tea..?
Make one for me as well"

127
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,071
That is all what we used to do.
We would smoke Ganja.. smoke Pot.

128
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:52,555
We would eat at local eatery.
Everything used to be on credit.

129
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,902
If there was money,
we would get booze too.

130
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:59,855
For 5-6 days we would simply
lounge about just like that. Stoned.

131
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,477
As Luke would say
"We would get a hard on"

132
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:04,694
We would wait for Shiuli.

133
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,517


134
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:16,350


135
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:35,529


136
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:40,903


137
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:49,061


138
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:56,751


139
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:04,946


140
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:08,293
"Hi Pondy"
"Pondy, this is Nimit."

141
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:11,266
"Nimit, this is Pondy"

142
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:25,221
Hi guys.

143
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:26,854
"Come"

144
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:33,291
"Guys this is Nimit"
"Nimit, this is Joy, Luke, Chicken, Nikhil.."

145
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:35,598
"Nikhil"

146
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,198
"Why is he named Pondy?"

147
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,866
Everyday she'd come with a new guy."

148
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,869
And Pondy didn't like it.

149
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,663
Everybody used to tease him..
Especially Luke.

150
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,686


151
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,842


152
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:18,193


153
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:22,541


154
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:25,813


155
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:29,714


156
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,199
Why you got a 'hard on' eh?

157
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,973
"So what?"
-"a 'hard on'"

158
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,212
That is what we had for life.

159
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,492
Sometimes we used to perform as well

160
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:09,963


161
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:17,727


162
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:25,256


163
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:32,140


164
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:38,148


165
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,836


166
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:44,788


167
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,902


168
00:22:51,276 --> 00:22:58,096


169
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:03,943


170
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:07,908


171
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:11,639


172
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:18,417


173
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:25,393


174
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:48,324


175
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:51,628


176
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:54,566


177
00:23:56,655 --> 00:23:58,488


178
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:05,603


179
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:13,425


180
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,109


181
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,946


182
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,537


183
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:30,715


184
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:39,267


185
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:48,619


186
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:52,424


187
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:59,747


188
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:07,186


189
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:43,195
"Am I a pimp of that b!bitch?"

190
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:58,000
"Luke.. Luke.. Luke.. Luke.."

191
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:06,598


192
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:14,569


193
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:18,683


194
00:26:19,098 --> 00:26:22,530


195
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:26,089


196
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:31,282


197
00:26:32,817 --> 00:26:36,483


198
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:41,373


199
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:50,698


200
00:26:51,774 --> 00:26:54,651


201
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:59,511


202
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:03,525


203
00:27:03,675 --> 00:27:06,701


204
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:09,973


205
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:14,044


206
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,126


207
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,483


208
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:34,091


209
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:41,268


210
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:48,053


211
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,253


212
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:05,407


213
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,879


214
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,922
"Pondy.."

215
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:23,034
"Pondy"

216
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:27,076
"What happened huh?"

217
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:30,997
"Pondy"

218
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:34,045
"What's the matter eh?"

219
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:38,298
"Why did you came here like this?"
-"Do I look like an idiot?"

220
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:41,175
-"I slog and play for that b!bitch,
and she is with somebody else?"

221
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:43,797
-"Is the word a55hole plastered here?"

222
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:45,806
-"Why are you smiling?"

223
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:48,960
-"Why.. why did you smiled?"
"What did she do..?"

224
00:28:50,015 --> 00:28:51,401


225
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,427
"HAVE YOU GONE FCUKING NUTS..?"
"Come back here you..!"

226
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,040
"He walked away!
.. Is he some kinda hotshot?"

227
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:01,024
"Are we idiots working for his dad or what?"

228
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:03,950
"You.."
-"Don't hit me!"

229
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,102
"And what'll you do about it?"
"Huh?"

230
00:29:06,251 --> 00:29:08,724
"Look.. you wanna act up, do it
at your place. Get it?"
"We Don't need you"

231
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:11,964
-"Hey Luke. Take it easy.."
"What easy man!"

232
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,959
"We slogging it out there.. and this.."
-"Why you hitting me"

233
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:18,091
"So should I worship you instead?"

234
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:21,330
Bloody Motherf***in idiot.."
-"At least ask him what's wrong?"

235
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:23,105
"What else..

236
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:26,984
The moment he sees that babe.."
-"Why drag Shiuli in all the time?"

237
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:28,945
-"Luke?"
-"Heard that? Here she comes.."

238
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,815
"Luke I am going"
-"So leave.. should I hail a cab for you?"

239
00:29:34,092 --> 00:29:35,606
"What about my money?"

240
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,323
"Let the payment arrive first!"

241
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,648
"Should I come like this only? "

242
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,284
"Don't blow my share. Will collect it tomorrow. ok?"
-"Yea fine."

243
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,561
"Come let's go"
-"Hey Hotshot.. Come over here"

244
00:29:55,382 --> 00:29:58,217
"Look here.. Pure Gold."

245
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:00,476
"And here .. Pure Muscle"

246
00:30:00,838 --> 00:30:03,509
"You have it?"
-"Hey take a hike Mister.."

247
00:30:07,154 --> 00:30:09,923
"By the way, you too ...

248
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:11,481
".. are pretty solid eh"

249
00:30:13,452 --> 00:30:16,777
"Had to really slog for this show..
And HE RUINED IT"

250
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:19,399
"Come Luke.. Let it go now"

251
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:21,375
"What leave it man?"

252
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,126
"Did you see exactly the kinda importance
she gives to this chap here?"

253
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,835
"That rat called her and
she strutted away with him"

254
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:34,029
"hasn't got a dime on him..
But he has to throw his tantrums!"

255
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:39,027
"Hey.. Have you got the moolah..huh?"

256
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,160
"Leave alone sleeping,
she wont even sit with you"

257
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,274
"Hey Pondy, she comes here just to sing.
Getting it?"

258
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:50,078
Luke was a no non sense guy.
That is why we used to be afraid of him.

259
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,309
He used to speak the truth..
but the bitter truth.

260
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:56,846
"Never mattered to him how
the others would feel like."

261
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:01,906
"All of us had the same problem.. Money.
.. and money only."

262
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,593
We didn't had any of it.

263
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:10,980
"You all are a nobody, still I gave you a show..
and you and that drummer ruined everything!"

264
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:13,516
-"So the public was carrying your daddy dear
on the shoulders back there?"

265
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,287
"Don't act smart with me ok?
Been conducting shows for 50 yrs."

266
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:18,696
"I know well how the public reacts"

267
00:31:18,856 --> 00:31:21,648
"Two penny groups formed and dissolved
right in front of me"

268
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:23,673
"And if that bloody drummer ever dared
to show himself again..

269
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,987
"I am Manas Ranjan Chaudhary.. I will.."
-"Hey you Chaudhary..

270
00:31:27,115 --> 00:31:28,628
"Firstly, Lower your voice.."

271
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:32,742
"Don't want to give the pay-check, Fine.
But no need to badmouth our friend."

272
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,534
"And you gonna fire us?
..I sack you instead."

273
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,942
"We Don't want to perform at your shows."

274
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:42,246
"Even I Don't want to work with you guys.
..Go to hell the lot of you."

275
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,680
"Hey.. I Don't plan to visit your place."

276
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:47,664
"Whackjob"
-"Hey what happened?"

277
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:49,710
"Nothing dude"
-"Should I deal with him?"

278
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:53,041
"No no..This Romeo.. Thanks to what
he did on-stage there.."

279
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:55,194
"Ruined everything..
Now we Don't get paid"

280
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:57,879
"But all that was during the last song.."

281
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:02,813
"Whether it was the last song or at Hong Kong
.. You did it, yes?"

282
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,002
"The money is gone. Get it?"
"And keep your trap shut now"

283
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,445
Something had to go wrong every time.

284
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:18,793
We were deep in debts.
We had to arrange for money to clear the account.

285
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:21,949
Pondy needed money to take shiuli out.

286
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:26,362
We needed money for ration,
to pay for our conveyance.

287
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,122
"Boss, this isn't going to work this way"

288
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:31,999
-"What do you mean?"
"Tomorrow I start looking for a job"

289
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,772
-"What job?"
"Anything"

290
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:38,762
"Unless we pay our debts,
our meals will be gone."

291
00:32:39,572 --> 00:32:41,661
"Will go and see what he says tomorrow"

292
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,620
-"And what good will that be?"
"At least wont be smoking ganja the whole day long"

293
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:56,358
"Hey Luke, what is to be done
regarding dinner?"

294
00:32:57,104 --> 00:32:58,745
"How about a tight slap from my side?"

295
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,316
"Wont pay you cash but will provide meals.
Will that work for you?"

296
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:05,747
"The kitchen is that side.
Get busy"

297
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:18,256
"Will inform Shiuli"

298
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,776
"Your order sir..?"
-"A half fried Egg"

299
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:35,375
"Listen.."

300
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,888
"The yellow part shouldn't be running..
And listen.."

301
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:46,080
"The white part shouldn't be overcooked"

302
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:48,510
"And listen..

303
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:53,443
"Sprinkle the salt only on the white,
not the yellow part"

304
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:55,980
"And listen..

305
00:33:58,324 --> 00:33:59,859
"The egg shouldn't be hard"
"And listen.."

306
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:08,148
"That half fried egg should be
from freshly laid eggs"

307
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:11,872
"Sir, the hen's name is champa.
That ok with you?"

308
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:16,828
"What did you say?"
"What did you just say?"
"What is the name of the chicken"

309
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:18,618
"Hey, whom are you calling a chicken?"

310
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:20,553
"He says here that the name
of the chicken is Champa"

311
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,867
"Hey, what are you doing"
-"How dare you raise your hand"

312
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:27,426
"This place isn't your father's
that you are hitting him"

313
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:29,734
-"What kind of misbehaviour is this?"

314
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:31,716
-"I will lodge a complain against you guys"

315
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:35,691
"Sir he is hitting him.."
"Went to take the order.. got slapped.."

316
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:41,041
"Now if.. some outsiders comes in
.. he'll beat us?"

317
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,753
"How can somebody..
We came here to work.."

318
00:34:55,695 --> 00:34:58,620
"Forget it mate"
"There is only one way here.. "

319
00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:01,583
"Whatever you want, just snatch it."

320
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,183
-"How can it be like that,
it happened only once. Wont be always like that."

321
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,672
"It will chicken, it will"

322
00:35:06,842 --> 00:35:09,911
"Its written in our fate"

323
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:14,562
"There is only one principal:
Look after yourself, to hell with others"

324
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,674
"Lets grab some stuff"

325
00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:22,427
"Come now 'Champa'. Come along.."

326
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:44,448
"Who's there?"
-"You got the stuff?"

327
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,263
"How much do you want"
-"Lemme see it first"
"Come in"

328
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:52,853
"Go straight up"

329
00:35:55,582 --> 00:35:58,544
"Go on.."
-"Come upstairs quickly"
"Right behind you"

330
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,605
"Look Chicken.. Hey watch it!"

331
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:11,719
"Tape recorder,
fridge.. the fcuker has it all!"

332
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,991
"Want some water?
Here."

333
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:22,588
"Check this out.."

334
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:27,683
"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Drinking water? exercising?"

335
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:30,027
-"Do you actually use it,
or is it just a showpiece?"

336
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,914
"Every morning..
Don't you see my muscles?"

337
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:34,493
-"Alright.. Now let us see the stuff"
"This is from Manali"

338
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,063
-"And that one?"
"From Afghanistan. Expensive stuff"

339
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:40,642
-"So You'll sell me the cheaper one eh?"

340
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,668
-"Hmm.. How much for this?"
"500"

341
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:50,249
-"Hey, selling me whole of Kabul or what?"
"Ok, cough out 450 .."

342
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,765
-"Yeah, ok. That'll do"

343
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:58,325
"Hey hand the money first.
Need to see the money for this.."

344
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:03,749
-"what you trying here shorty?"
"You owe me 2000 already, need
to pay all of it here. "

345
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:05,433
"Getting it?"
-"Ok, I'll pay"

346
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:08,321
-"I need the stuff first"
"Payment comes first"

347
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:12,030
-"look shorty, I'm asking coolly.. Hand me the stuff.
Else I'll rip yours so bad,

348
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,746
"that you'll have to get it mended
professionally."

349
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:17,433
"Told you about paying first. Hey! take him
along with you and scoot."

350
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,042
"Come Luke, let's go"
-"So you wont budge huh?" -"Nope"

351
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:22,877
"You wont hand it to me?" -"Nope"
"HEY You hit me? What do you think of me eh?"

352
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:25,520
"Hey you, tell him. Take him away with you"

353
00:37:25,669 --> 00:37:28,249
"You'll come to my house and threaten me eh?"

354
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:29,709
"Let go of my hand!"

355
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:32,991
-"You bloody dumbell.. "
"Hey what are you doing!"

356
00:37:37,606 --> 00:37:39,524
-"Lay a hand on me eh?"

357
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:42,807
"Let it go Luke"

358
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,387
"You practice with the dumbells right?"
-"PLS Don't HURT ME"

359
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:50,069
"Get it..

360
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:51,944

"Move.. Get the stuff.

00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:25,627
-"Come here"

371
00:38:25,892 --> 00:38:28,855

385
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:24,261


386
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,533
"What the hell man..

387
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:35,134
-"Ticket Ticket"

388
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,247
"What?"
-"Ticket Ticket" "Money Money?"

389
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:43,313
"Haven't got it"

00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:44,997
"Buddy we'll alight real soon"

00:39:48,204 --> 00:39:52,531
-"Down. Take your hand off"
"Don't touch him ok?"

393
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:56,208
"It is close-by, my stop"
-"Down I said,get down now"

394
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,787
"Why you pushing me mate?"
-"Down"

395
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:01,728
"My stop is really close-by"
-"Get Down"

396
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:03,444
"Why are you stuck on this?"
-"Get off"

397
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:05,469
-"This is not your Dad's coach"
"WHAT?"

398
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,973
"You fcuker.."
-"Luke.. Luke.. Stop it mate"

399
00:40:47,627 --> 00:40:50,910
"Move to that side"

400
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:55,077
"Gonna rip you open.. Get there"

401
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:57,656
"Move it.. Move it"
-"On your knees!"

402
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:01,119
"SHUT UP!"
-"Luke.. let it go man"

403
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:03,507
-"Enough Luke.. Enough"

404
00:41:05,899 --> 00:41:08,499
"Money.. Gimme your money"
-"What are you doing man"

405
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:12,464
"Dad's coach huh?"
-"Leave it Luke"
"This is MY coach!"

406
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,083
-"Leave it mate.."

407
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:19,212
"This is my Dad's coach Get it?"
"I am going to smash this to pieces"
-"Luke Police!

408
00:41:19,915 --> 00:41:22,153
"This is my Dad's coach Get it!"
-"Luke Police!"

409
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,702
"What?"
-"Luke Police is coming"
-"Luke Police.. RUN"

410
00:41:25,873 --> 00:41:29,581
-"What? Let them come" - "Luke.."
-"Hey why are you panicking.. Run Goddamnit haha"

411
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:34,663
That was the first time I saw the devilish intent on his face.
-"Was he always like that?"

412
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:38,388
"He was impulsive right from the beginning,
but he never did beat anybody like that."

413
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,222
"Yea, as if he showered his love upon me.."
"He was the biggest mofo ever"

414
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,800
"Hey.. Shut up"

415
00:41:43,183 --> 00:41:46,146
"Sir, Luke was like that from the very beginning."
"This guy may have realised it that day,

416
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,928
"..but ever since I knew him,
he was like that only"

417
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:52,455
"He wasn't like that always"
-"Yeah, he was your God isn't it?

418
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,842
Keep shut!"
-"Pondy.. Shut up now."

419
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,266
"Whatever has happened, has happened.
What's the use?"

420
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,099
"It shouldn't have happened"
-"Kadam.." -"Yes Sir"

421
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:02,595
"Take him away"
-"But why Sir?"

422
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:05,174
"Make him sit outside..
bring him in When we are done here"

423
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,156
-"Told you to zip it"

424
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:16,248
"Excuse me Sir..

00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:19,424

426
00:42:23,518 --> 00:42:25,159
"Sir.. can I take one as well?"

427
00:42:50,363 --> 00:42:53,219
"Sprayed Gucci Envy there ?

428
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:56,373
"Been sniffing it like forever.."
-"Mind your own business Fatso"

429
00:42:57,311 --> 00:43:00,487
-"What's going on in here?"
"Ah Luke! Did you get the stuff?"

430
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,837
-"What stuff are you talking about whacko?"

431
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,077
-"Green.. or greenbacks?"

432
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:10,837
"So much money Luke..
Where'd you get it from!?"

433
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:15,207
-"Earned it myself..
Pondy my dear, prepare a joint.."

434
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:16,933
"Do it yourself"

435
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,473
-"Why..?

436
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:21,882
-"Are you in a bad mood sweetheart?"

437
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:26,251
"What is wrong with him guys?"
-"He has tasted blood today"

438
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:52,638
"What's wrong?"

439
00:43:54,428 --> 00:43:55,920
"You are insane Luke"

440
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,669
"Why?

441
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:01,971
"Because I thrashed that conductor.. huh?"

442
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:06,596
"You should have seen your face when
you were bashing the conductor in"

443
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:13,414
"wasn't I looking good back then?"

444
00:44:15,226 --> 00:44:16,654
"Leave it"

445
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,650
"Hey.. Speak up."

446
00:44:26,142 --> 00:44:27,613
"wasn't I looking good"

447
00:44:29,214 --> 00:44:33,903
"Leave it be"
"Everything is a joke to you. You wont get it"

448
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:36,354
"Then explain it to me"

449
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,816
"Hey.. Go ahead"

450
00:44:42,194 --> 00:44:43,985
"Oi.. Don't fcuk around with me"

451
00:44:45,221 --> 00:44:47,011
"hahaha Fcuker got all worked up"

452
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:07,311
"Finally the lad is up..
Will achieve something relevant now"

453
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:11,350
-"He wont do jack.. will take a leak
and will again hit the sack"

454
00:45:26,652 --> 00:45:30,936


455
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:34,901


456
00:45:43,245 --> 00:45:47,125


457
00:45:47,338 --> 00:45:51,260


458
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:55,341


459
00:45:55,682 --> 00:45:59,847


460
00:46:00,678 --> 00:46:04,664


461
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:08,202


462
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:16,484


463
00:46:16,996 --> 00:46:24,711


464
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:51,921


465
00:46:54,522 --> 00:46:55,907


466
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:01,950


467
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,283


468
00:47:05,475 --> 00:47:10,867


469
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:17,725


470
00:47:17,981 --> 00:47:23,373


471
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:32,256


472
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:39,524


473
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,600


474
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:47,927


475
00:47:49,238 --> 00:47:56,773


476
00:47:56,922 --> 00:48:04,626


477
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:13,088


478
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,878
"Take my name in any of the music company.."

479
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,286
"Manish Ranjan. They all know me."

480
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:33,775
That day we had a very good show.
Manish Ranjan was there as well.

481
00:48:35,384 --> 00:48:39,007
He was a friend of Nikhil's.
A well known PRO in the music industry.

482
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:44,491
If we hadn't bumped into him that day, we would have
continued to perform at the nondescript clubs.

483
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:47,480
But he made us dream big.

484
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,224
He assured that he'll help us climb the steps.

485
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,899
He was giving us an opportunity,

486
00:48:53,602 --> 00:48:56,693
and we..
we were ready to do anything for it.

487
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:03,945
"What happened?"
-"He is still inside"

488
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:07,430
"We'll see.
He was making pretty tall claims"

489
00:49:11,112 --> 00:49:12,626
"Luke"
-"Yeah"

490
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:17,802
"What kinda demo cassette is this?"
-"Why? isn't it any good?"

491
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:21,979
"Come inside"
"Come on"

492
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:31,539
"I Don't like this guy"
-"Do you like me?"

493
00:49:31,816 --> 00:49:34,459
"Don't say anything to her"
-"I am not saying.. I am asking"

494
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,038
"So Don't ask"
-"So you ask her instead"

495
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,765
"What should I ask her"
-"The same that I was asking"

496
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,984
"And what were you asking?"
-"Does she likes me?"

497
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,350
"What kinda tape
have you got the recording on?"

498
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:49,474
"what should have I done?"
-"The sound variation is too much. You still are.."

499
00:49:49,794 --> 00:49:51,712
"You should have done this professionally.

500
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:54,014
Via some good sound engineer"

501
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:57,476
"You need to invest money
if you want good results"

502
00:49:58,073 --> 00:50:00,759
"You have the fire in you, and people
should be made aware of that.."

503
00:50:02,421 --> 00:50:05,384
"How much will it cost?"

504
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,947
"Around 5 Lakh rupees"
-"How much.. fiv.."

505
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,944
"Why, what happened"
-"No nothing. The fire got doused mate"

506
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:19,253
"Hey, I'll get you some discount..
as you are Nikhil's friend!"

507
00:50:19,477 --> 00:50:22,589
"Otherwise with such a cassette,
you wont be even able to enter any such office"

508
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:24,550
"Okay, I'll try.
Bye."

509
00:50:26,147 --> 00:50:27,587
"Come on gang"
-"Close the door"

510
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:51,635
"The tuft was out of place a bit.
Was getting my hair set"

511
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:55,642
"You Don't need to do
any setting chicken dude"

512
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:02,409
"What are you doing?"

513
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:04,679
"What are up to?"

514
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:07,727


515
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:11,717
"Hey have you lost it or what?"

516
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:15,128
"Hey.. gonna get yourself killed one day by me!"

517
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:17,941
"Bloody Fatso!"

518
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:21,320
"Don't mess with him I am telling you"

519
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:24,112
"He is gonna thrash you.."

520
00:51:25,508 --> 00:51:28,151
"got a problem with me?"
-"We're thinking about your problems only"

521
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:30,282
"you happen to be my father?"
-"Ask that from your mother"

522
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:33,266
"Luke I will..."
-"Yeah come on.."

523
00:51:34,652 --> 00:51:37,742
"Why are you guys always after Pondy"

524
00:51:38,552 --> 00:51:41,408
"Leave it man. No point
in engaging with these losers"

525
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,059
"Fcukers.. always bickering with each other,
and yet stick together"

526
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:49,663
"You see our problem is..
We are very frustrated from inside."

527
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:53,217
"We all are failures except for Shiuli."

528
00:51:54,346 --> 00:51:58,289
"And we are dead broke as well.
Any other social enquiry Sir?"

529
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,211
"Hey, Your Dad is loaded.. right?"
"Get us some money?"

530
00:52:06,866 --> 00:52:10,937
"If Dad was ready to dole out some cash for me,
why would I be hanging around in here?"

531
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:14,348
"Let's do this Luke..
We abduct this Fcuker"

532
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:18,259
"His money, his agent.. and our Album"

533
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,712
"That's a pretty cool idea"
-"Wh.. what did you say?"

534
00:52:22,522 --> 00:52:25,080
"That its a pretty cool idea"
-"See.. he got all worked up"

535
00:52:26,248 --> 00:52:29,360
"No I am serious"
"Luke its a terrific idea"

536
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:32,089
"See.. My dad has a lot of black money.

537
00:52:32,595 --> 00:52:34,790
"You kidnap me, ask for 2Lakhs."

538
00:52:34,939 --> 00:52:37,156
"Hand over 1 Lakh to me, rest is yours"

539
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:41,074
"Hey what are you thinking?"

540
00:52:41,671 --> 00:52:43,823
"Take a seat. How much have you had?"

541
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:46,871
"I haven't lost it idiot.."

542
00:52:48,184 --> 00:52:51,914
"Mother swear"
"My father has so much money, and look here..

543
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,964
I Don't have 10 rupees with me"

544
00:52:57,263 --> 00:53:00,247
"He clings to his money as if
he'll take it with him when he dies"

545
00:53:08,171 --> 00:53:09,364
"Nikhil..

546
00:53:10,217 --> 00:53:12,562
If we have to ask for ransom,
why not 5 instead of 2?"

547
00:53:13,116 --> 00:53:17,043
"Album will be released, and so will be our debts.
Wot say?"

548
00:53:17,347 --> 00:53:20,757
"5 will be too much"

549
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:23,997
"Just assume that we abducted you multiple times"

550
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:28,090
"5 or 2..? Everything will get covered.
Wot say huh?"

551
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,903
"Come on man.. speak up!"

552
00:53:37,205 --> 00:53:38,505
"Yeah ok"
-"Hey Luke.." -"What?"

553
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,894
"Are you actually serious?"

554
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:44,889
"Why.. aren't you?"

555
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:47,510
"I thought we are just fooling around"

556
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,432
"Do you have a single dime on you?"
"No.. right?"

557
00:53:52,264 --> 00:53:54,652
"He is making the sacrifice..
and its you who is freaking out?"

558
00:53:58,589 --> 00:54:02,170
"Look here.. First we need to decide
whether we want to do this or not"

559
00:54:02,831 --> 00:54:05,026
First we need to decide whether we want to do this or not"
"If you aren't coming, will do this by myself."

560
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:09,543
"Joy.. you in?"
-"No question about it Luke!"
-"You ?"

561
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,037
"Yeah"
"You Chicken..?"

562
00:54:13,465 --> 00:54:14,787
"Don't think too much.. Just say Yes or No.."

563
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:18,688
"Say yes dude!"

564
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:22,440
"Pondy you?"

565
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:25,509
"Everybody is in"

566
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,063
Luke had decided.

567
00:54:32,172 --> 00:54:36,451
With time everybody agreed to it.
Pondy was hesitant first, but then he too came on-board.

568
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,607
All of a sudden everybody started to believe
that something will happen.

569
00:54:41,262 --> 00:54:43,137
Even before seeing the money,
we became Pop stars.

570
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:45,908
"This idea was Nikhil's own?"
-"Yea"

571
00:54:48,615 --> 00:54:51,599
"You said Pandey was reluctant?"
-"Pondy"

572
00:54:52,147 --> 00:54:54,534
"Whatever"
-"He..

573
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,476
"He was always scared"

574
00:54:57,625 --> 00:54:59,884
"He was afraid that something might go wrong"

575
00:55:00,545 --> 00:55:03,231
"When he started thinking about the money,
he started thinking about Shiuli"

576
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:06,903
"And after all, we were not committing a crime."

577
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:10,057
"Asking Nikhil's father 5 lakh rupees.. For his son"
"That wasn't a crime?"

578
00:55:10,228 --> 00:55:13,127
"It was Nikhil's own idea."

579
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:16,511
"We asked his money for his own sake"
-"Where will we keep you?"

580
00:55:16,682 --> 00:55:19,133
"Here, in the godown"
-"What if somebody comes in to check?"

581
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:24,280
"You been conducting rehearsals in here since eternity.
Anybody ever peeked in?"

582
00:55:24,983 --> 00:55:26,049
"Did anybody..?"

583
00:55:27,861 --> 00:55:30,227
"Hey Luke..
think it over once again man"

584
00:55:31,005 --> 00:55:34,330
"What is there to think about?"
"we actually kidnapping him? huh?"

585
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,911
"This is all staged.
Who's gonna snitch?"

586
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:40,404
"What if he reneged?"

587
00:55:40,997 --> 00:55:43,598
"If he does so.. I will screw him over.
Get it?"

588
00:55:44,663 --> 00:55:46,283
"Cut this drivel out."

589
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,728
"Man he is getting himself abducted.
Why bother? We get money in the end, right?"

590
00:55:56,952 --> 00:55:58,679
"You want Shiuli or not?"

591
00:55:59,979 --> 00:56:02,833
"Or do you want to roam around
alone your entire life?"

592
00:56:04,502 --> 00:56:07,465
"Look.. once you have the moolah with you..

593
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:11,451
"She'll come all by herself clinging to you"

594
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:14,051
"Come.. let's get on with it"

595
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,161
"I am scared buddy."

596
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:22,122
"Pondy..

597
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,287
"What did I say to you?"

598
00:56:25,734 --> 00:56:28,676
"You coming or not?"
"Don't fcuk with me!"

599
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:38,143
"You do one thing.. Stay in the godown with Nikhil.

600
00:56:38,825 --> 00:56:40,445
"Be the good friend of his.. Okay?"

601
00:56:41,596 --> 00:56:43,067
"Now scoot"

602
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:47,646
I felt that something is about to give.
Didn't knew why.

603
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,979
I had decided that whatever
is that we are going do,

604
00:57:00,578 --> 00:57:02,475
I wont expose myself.

605
00:57:03,658 --> 00:57:07,111
I didn't wanted to get caught
if things went awry

606
00:57:16,605 --> 00:57:18,161
"What you thinking Chicken?"

607
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:21,683
"Nothing"

608
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:25,115
"You too scared like Pondy?"

609
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,699
"Luke.."

610
00:57:32,097 --> 00:57:34,378
"I am not coming along
to the restaurant tomorrow"

611
00:57:35,507 --> 00:57:36,914
"Why?"

612
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:40,005
"I will stay with Nikhil
in the godown tomorrow."
