1
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,612
Lucky's luck is very bad.

2
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:19,721
He is very sad because of that.

3
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:23,624
Lucky's luck is very bad.

4
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,390
He is very sad because of that.

5
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,065
He is caught..

6
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:33,102
He is caught even
when he does not steal.

7
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:37,532
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

8
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:40,807
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

9
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:44,248
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

10
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:46,649
This is Lucky's..

11
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:57,554
Lucky..

12
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,762
Lucky..

13
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:04,763
The boy is nice,
but his destiny is bad.

14
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:08,102
ls bad.. destiny is bad.

15
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:11,540
He looks like a hero,
but is a bit dumb.

16
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:15,206
ls a bit dumb.

17
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:16,942
Without his fault..
he has to keep saying..

18
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,144
Without his fault..
he has to keep saying sorry.

19
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,678
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

20
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,918
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

21
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:30,394
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

22
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:32,432
This is Lucky's..

23
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:51,042
Neither is he intelligent,
nor is he excellent.

24
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:54,143
Nor is he excellent.

25
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:56,188
Everyone suspects him.

26
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:59,919
But he is very innocent.

27
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:03,028
His impression is bad.

28
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:06,293
His impression is bad,
people think he is a fool.

29
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,732
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

30
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:13,000
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

31
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:16,440
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

32
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,477
This is Lucky's..

33
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,997
How was my dance, master?

34
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:51,737
The dance was good.
But the floor was crooked.

35
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,445
The floor is crooked!

36
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,882
You want us to get the floor
of our house repaired for you?

37
00:03:57,017 --> 00:04:00,077
You can fool my wife,
but not Gurinder Brar.

38
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,345
Get out of here!

39
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:03,415
The floor is crooked.

40
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,918
Tulsi, what was going on here?

41
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,626
l was learning classical dance.

42
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:11,825
Let me also know who you want
to impress by learning to dance.

43
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:14,531
You've turned this
house into a brothel.

44
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:15,895
Your name is Tulsi Brar.

45
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:19,595
l married you thinking that you
would bring honor into my family.

46
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,468
But you turned out to be a cactus.

47
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,065
What have l done?

48
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,168
Which course have you not taken up?

49
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:26,774
All the courses
in the world are over,

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,404
but your desire to
learn is not over yet.

51
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:31,682
Look, l'm doing the cooking course,
teaching course..

52
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:35,551
..painting course,
dance course, everything for you.

53
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,646
That's it. You only know
how to talk all this nonsense.

54
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:42,260
George Bush has rightly said that,
the whole year, have to tolerate this.

55
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:43,656
l'm learning for you.

56
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,253
Why did you have to learn everything
after coming to my house?

57
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:46,924
You should have learnt something
in your father's house too.

58
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,024
Enough. Don't talk about my father.

59
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:50,668
l've learnt a lot from
my father's house as well.

60
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,261
You've only learnt how
to exploit your husband.

61
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:57,203
l don't understand what you want
to achieve by being an all-rounder.

62
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:58,275
l Just pass my time.

63
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,311
You go to have fun
with your friends.

64
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,574
And you leave me home
to take care of our child.

65
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,742
Did you take care of our child?
You're trying to be Mother Teresa.

66
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,514
Trying all your weird recipes,
my son is suffering from epilepsy!

67
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:12,586
Fine. From tomorrow, you will cook.

68
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:13,658
Let me see..

69
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:16,890
how you leave us alone at home and
go with your friends to have fun.

70
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,928
Tell the truth. What have
you done for me till today?

71
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,628
Well done, Tulsi Brar. Well done.

72
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,634
Have some shame. You're saying
l haven't done anything for you.

73
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:27,138
Lie down and think about
what l have done for you.

74
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,571
What have you done?

75
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:32,042
Ungrateful man! Did you forget
the day when you were in trouble?

76
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:33,773
Who donated a bottle of blood to you?
- Enough!

77
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,281
Since you've donated blood to me,my
relationship with you has turned sour.

78
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,007
Since our blood has become one..

79
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:42,111
l feel like your sister
more than your husband.

80
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:44,452
l'm afraid that when
our Chaku grows up..

81
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,515
..he might call me
uncle instead of father.

82
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:49,754
Mother! Mother! Mother! - Oh, God!
Chaku has got an epileptic attack!

83
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:52,129
My Chaku has got an
epileptic attack again.

84
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,063
Move. Let me give him first aid.

85
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,634
Son, smell the shoe.
Very good. lnhale. lnhale.

86
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,272
Son, how do you feel?

87
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,633
Thanks, father. - No. Thanks, Bata.

88
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,075
This is their first shoe that has
been used more to smell than to wear.

89
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:08,473
What did you eat?

90
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:11,283
Mother gave me
bread with spicy Jam.

91
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:15,219
Now who taught you
to make spicy Jam?

92
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:16,310
Have you ever heard of a spicy Jam?

93
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:19,853
My Chaku's epilepsy isn't getting cured
because of your stupid inventions.

94
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,154
The epilepsy won't be cured by
making him smell your shoe either.

95
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:24,091
Be wise and change the doctor.

96
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,562
Tulsi, l'm thinking that
instead of changing the doctor..

97
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,224
..why don't we change
Chaku's mother?

98
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:31,904
You'll bring home another woman!

99
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:36,808
Osama Bin Laden has rightly said,
the whole year, have to tolerate this.

100
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,741
George Bush had said
this sometime back.

101
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:41,872
Whoever said this nonsense, Just
think that it makes a lot of sense.

102
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:43,872
Father, l can proudly say..

103
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,645
that l haven't taken a
single penny as dowry from you.

104
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,380
Son, you're living in our
house as our live-in son-in-law..

105
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,020
..and you want dowry money as well?

106
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,717
You treat your son-in-law
as your servant.

107
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,452
As soon as our wedding was
solemnized, you fired your driver..

108
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,652
..saying that your
son-in-law is here now.

109
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,729
l drove the car in which
she was sent off. Have some shame.

110
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,454
Brother-in-law,
what else do you want?

111
00:06:58,565 --> 00:06:59,827
That we should seat
you and serve you food?

112
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,024
Do whatever you want.

113
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,730
But l must be the first
guy in this world who Just eats.

114
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:05,862
Dear, you were saying..

115
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,702
that he would take up the
responsibility of our house.

116
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,604
Father, you misheard.

117
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,837
He won't take up the responsibility,
but he'd take things from the house.

118
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:12,969
He sold everything.

119
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,479
And now he's eyeing us.

120
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,409
Dimpy, please lower your eyes.

121
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:18,881
Please don't talk in between.

122
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,486
From now on, l won't lower my eyes.
l deserve some respect.

123
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:24,054
Don't we respect you?

124
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:27,491
What respect? Wherever you go,
you introduce your dog before me.

125
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,686
This is our Tommy and
this is our son-in-law.

126
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,262
He crossed the limit once.

127
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:33,865
He introduced only the dog,
while l was standing on the side.

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,690
l swear on God.

129
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,860
l've never differentiated
between you and our dog.

130
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,939
l'm furious right now.
l will kill each one of you.

131
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,565
Son, you may kill each one of us.

132
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:47,504
But before doing that, at least
open the gate. We want to come in.

133
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:49,410
l will open it. But don't you dare!

134
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,949
Promise me that you'll
never hit me again.

135
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,521
Yes, darling. - Mandy speaking.

136
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:03,594
l know it's you, Mandy. Does
anyone call his wife 'darling'?

137
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:04,821
Why have you called at this hour?

138
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:06,454
l should Just file a case..

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,093
..that after having an
affair with me for five years..

140
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:10,601
..you couldn't marry me?

141
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,796
l would have married you,
but l've already married her.

142
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,032
l took four nuptial rounds
with her, and four with you..

143
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,129
..would make a total
of eight nuptial rounds.

144
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,503
Does any wedding have
eight nuptial rounds?

145
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,902
Don't worry.

146
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,977
By God's grace, l'll find
a nice day and give her a divorce..

147
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,775
..and then l'll marry you.

148
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:25,249
l'll slap you.
Give her a divorce today itself.

149
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,878
lt's a divorce. lt's not a bun that
l can Just go to the bakery and buy.

150
00:08:27,954 --> 00:08:30,047
Give her a divorce today?
How can l give her a divorce today?

151
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,489
My wife cut her hands.
She won't be able to sign.

152
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:33,559
How will we get a divorce?

153
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,127
Jassi, how does the
henna look on my hands?

154
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:41,063
You said her hands are cut. She
says her hands are adorned with henna.

155
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,459
No, henna is antiseptic.

156
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:45,868
Turmeric is antiseptic.

157
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:47,935
You apply turmeric.

158
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,268
Forget the turmeric.
l'm in a hurry.

159
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:53,642
Very soon, l will be a
bride and you will be in trouble.

160
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:57,275
No. No. No problem. No problem.

161
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,016
Apply the turmeric.
Apply the turmeric.

162
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,214
Whose call was it?

163
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:07,015
The butcher.

164
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,527
You were talking to the butcher
about turmeric and antiseptic?

165
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:15,058
Actually, when the butcher was about
to butcher a goat, the goat bit him.

166
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,293
So, l told him to apply turmeric
on the wound as it's an antiseptic.

167
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:18,830
Listen.
- Yes.

168
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:22,807
l think very soon, there are going
to be three people in this house.

169
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,473
No, no. l'm going to refuse her.

170
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:31,109
l'm going to refuse him
that until the third member..

171
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,118
..comes into this house,
stop butchering goats.

172
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,783
Our life is become like
old torn currency notes.

173
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:47,360
The veil has been torn to pieces.

174
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:54,130
This has happened to everyone..

175
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:57,301
..drinking whiskey.

176
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:16,086
Her complexion was wheatish
when she came from PunJab.

177
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:23,365
She would use hair extensions.

178
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:29,799
Her complexion was wheatish
when she came from PunJab.

179
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:33,835
She would use hair extensions.

180
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:38,181
Now her hair looks as if
she's come from a beauty parlor.

181
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:39,842
Drinking whiskey.

182
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,350
Drinking whiskey.

183
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:45,313
Her complexion is now red,
drinking whiskey.

184
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,949
Drinking whiskey.

00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,086
Drinking whiskey.

187
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:55,801
Her complexion is now red,
drinking whiskey.

188
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:58,063
Drinking whiskey.

189
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:16,312
Looks like a star,
but is from the village.

190
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:23,386
She is like love,
does not stay for long.

191
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:30,094
Looks like a star,
but is from the village.

192
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:33,969
She is like love,
does not stay for long.

193
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:38,409
lt is now a year.

194
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,673

Her complexion is now red,
drinking whiskey.

200
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,922
Drinking whiskey.

201
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:09,237
The damsel wears
a ring in one finger.

202
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:11,071
Wears a ring.

203
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:16,605
Her beloved's name
is inscribed on the ring.

204
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:23,214
The damsel wears
a ring in one finger.

205
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,814
Her beloved's name
is inscribed on the ring.

206
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:28,288
On the ring. On the ring.

207
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:31,728
Where is he, is the question.

208
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:33,459
Drinking whiskey.

209
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,725
Drinking whiskey.

Drinking whiskey.

216
00:12:58,257 --> 00:12:59,690
Here are plums.

217
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,116
Should l make another peg?
- Let it be.

218
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:04,320
Get an affidavit
made that we're off.

219
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,329
How many wives do you have?
Just three?

220
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,731
Does a man marry the whole village?

221
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:10,865
We're three men,
so we'll have only three wives.

222
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,632
Have some shame.
You can't even take care of one.

223
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:15,773
Look at me.
l alone am taking care of so many.

224
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:18,706
Take care of someone
who's like our wives.

225
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:22,403
You'll be so frustrated that
you'll have to start doing yoga.

226
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,813
He's talking nonsense.

227
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,247
He is boasting.

228
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:29,482
l'm not boasting. l'm telling
you the reality of life.

229
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,848
A real man is the one
who dominates his wife.

230
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,051
Seeing your situation,
l remembered a poem.

231
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,720
We too knew many poems.
But before our marriage.

232
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:37,922
Just get married.

233
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:41,763
You too will sit in the
kitchen and write sad songs.

234
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:44,433
l rule today and l will
rule even after marriage.

235
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:47,367
Seeing your attitude, only your
wife can bring you to your senses.

236
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:49,975
l will rule.
You are here and so am l.

237
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:52,772
So be here. People are
waiting for us. Let's go.

238
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:55,573
You three are my friends
on Facebook, right? - We are. Why?

239
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:57,339
Our friendship will be restricted
only till Facebook, you cowards.

240
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,441
Don't you dare call me again!

241
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,778
You eat plums while drinking.

242
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:05,346
Brother, we too would
eat pistachios while drinking.

243
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:08,322
After marriage, we've become
so tense that our sugar is high.

244
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:09,985
We've been forced to eat plums.

245
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,765
This idiot! He doesn't
know what married life is.

246
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:18,030
Charlie Chaplin has rightly said,
the whole year, have to tolerate this.

247
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,231
l've seen several movies
of Charlie Chaplin.

248
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,001
He didn't say that in a single
movie. He Just kept doing this.

249
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:24,309
He would work in English movies.

250
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:25,935
Even if he had said it, you
wouldn't have understood anyway.

251
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:29,412
Our wives have ruined us.
Our lives have gone haywire.

252
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,580
Girls are crazy about him now.

253
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:35,414
The day he goes crazy about
someone, he will also be like us.

254
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:40,920
Get ready, son. You never know what
your destiny has in store for you.

255
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:41,721
Yes.

256
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:49,827
Okay.

257
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:53,595
Hey, one against that. that one.

258
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,577
One sec.

259
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,486
Ready?

260
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,453
She's such a beautiful girl.

261
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,388
l think she's blind.

262
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:21,231
How does it matter?
Love is blind anyway.

263
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:25,000
l'll help you.

264
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,005
What are you doing?
l mean, what are you doing?

265
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,974
PunJabi? You were standing in this
pose, so l thought you were blind.

266
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:31,835
l'm getting my
photographs clicked here.

267
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,078
Your camera.
- ls it?

268
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,544
Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

269
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:37,214
Excuse me.
- By the way, l'm PunJabi too.

270
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:40,609
You don't need to mention.
Actually, your behavior shows.

271
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,320
Even your behavior shows
that you don't belong here.

272
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,890
Oh, yes. l've come here for
a research on Thailand tourism.

273
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:47,960
l see. l'll drop you.

274
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:49,387
There's no need
to take the trouble.

275
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,029
lt's not a trouble.
No one's waiting for me at home.

276
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:55,291
l'm single. l'm hoping
that l'll double very soon.

277
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:56,799
All the best.

278
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:59,530
l have an import
and export business.

279
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:01,333
Sometimes here and
sometimes in PunJab.

280
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,608
Whoever marries me
will live in luxury.

281
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:07,007
Very good. - l have a huge
bungalow in Chandigarh.

282
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,837
l have many properties too.

283
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,346
Now tell me, where do l drop you?

284
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,678
Leave me right here.

285
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,477
And listen.. - l knew you would come
back and request me to drop you home.

286
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:20,091
Actually,
l wanted to tell you to please

287
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,092
give me your date
of birth and photograph.

288
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:26,959
lf l meet you the next time, l may
be able to get a nice alliance for you.

289
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:28,533
As you wish.

290
00:16:58,798 --> 00:16:59,526
Hi!

291
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,391
You?

292
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:05,098
lf you're thinking that l knew that
you're researching on Thailand tourism..

293
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:08,367
..and that's why l'm coming after
you to every tourist spot to meet you..

294
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,405
..then you're wrong.

295
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:10,902
We've met by chance.

296
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,569
Don't you feel that
you think too much?

297
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:17,471
lf a person thinks before walking,
he never falls in life..

298
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:19,577
This much is fine.

299
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:22,946
l don't like those
boys who follow girls.

300
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:25,290
You think Just like my mother.

301
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,950
But let me tell you that you won't
find a better guide than me in Thailand.

302
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:32,095
Your research will be complete
and so will my search. lsn't it?

303
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,995
lt's a very nice
idea to entice girls.

304
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,530
No, no. lt's not that good.

305
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,694
l haven't been able to
entice any girl with this idea.

306
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,802
l'm Lucky.

307
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:42,572
You call this luck?
- No, no. My name is Lucky.

308
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,740
Oh. Seerat.

309
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:47,936
By the way, looking at you, it doesn't
seem like you don't have any girlfriend.

310
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,706
No, no. l have many friends.

311
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:53,946
But there's no one seeing whom my
heart would say that this one is enough.

312
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,311
Your romance is very unromantic.

313
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,517
Will you have coffee with me?

314
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,623
Sorry.

315
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,658
Good.

316
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,786
l don't like girls who agree to have
coffee with boys at the first meeting.

317
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,359
l don't like them.

318
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,926
But l also don't like those who
don't agree even the second time.

319
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,803
Here's your coffee. - Thank you.

320
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:24,212
So, tell me. What have
you thought about marriage?

321
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,144
Whose marriage?

322
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,650
Yours. l mean..

323
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,550
..in someone else's wedding,
you Just greet them and come back.

324
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:30,120
You don't have to think too much.

325
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:33,484
l will marry the one
my brothers choose for me.

326
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:35,921
Did your brothers get
married to the one you chose?

327
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:37,220
No.

328
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,295
Why do girls claim their
rights after marriage?

329
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:40,295
Why not before?

330
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:43,196
Actually, l've seriously
not thought about marriage yet.

331
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,968
Show me your hand.

332
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:46,766
l'll read your palm and
predict when you'll get married.

333
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:47,996
You can read palms?

334
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:49,597
l can read many other things.

335
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:53,739
l mean, birth charts, horoscopes.
Show me. Show me.

336
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:54,840
Okay.

337
00:18:57,082 --> 00:18:59,380
Your husband will be Lucky. - What?

338
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:02,815
l mean, the person you'll
marry will be very lucky. - Oh.

339
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:05,390
Do you know where this line goes?
- Where?

340
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:06,786
To a huge bungalow.

341
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:09,621
lt's clearly written here
that your husband will have..

342
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:11,662
..an very good import
and export business.

343
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,162
Tell the truth.
When will l get married?

344
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:14,756
lf you wish,
let's get married today.

345
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:16,324
Don't Joke.

346
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,434
l'm not Joking.
l'm telling the truth.

347
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:20,969
l truly love you.

348
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,072
There have been
many girls in my life.

349
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,669
But you're the first
one who's special.

350
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:27,975
So now l want to
ask that special girl..

351
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:30,577
..does she feel that
l am a bit special or no?

352
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:47,328
Love is like a disease.

353
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,627
No one should fall for it.

354
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:54,696
Your stole smells like
flowers to me, beloved.

355
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:57,298
Smells like flowers to me,
beloved.

356
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,706
Love is like a disease.

357
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:04,347
No one should fall for it.

358
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:09,183
Your stole smells like
flowers to me, beloved.

359
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,653
lt is broken like a glass.

360
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:14,225
My heart has fallen for you.

361
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,692
My heart has fallen for you.

362
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:21,193
Love is like a disease.

363
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,458
No one should fall for it.

364
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:28,730
Your stole smells like
flowers to me, beloved.

365
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,714
Being a girl.

366
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:43,219
l patiently wait.

367
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:45,382
On soft beds..

368
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:48,716
..l can't sleep anymore, darling.

369
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,924
Being a girl.

370
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,700
l patiently wait.

371
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:00,101
On soft beds..

372
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,571
..l can't sleep anymore, darling.

373
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,871
l have a fever.

374
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,173
l have a viral too.

375
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:14,445
Love is like a disease.

376
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,052
No one should fall for it.

377
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:19,452
Love is like a disease.

378
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,355
No one should fall for it.

379
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:31,734
A long night, without seeing you.

380
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:36,798
My eyes are waiting to see you.

381
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:46,250
A long night, without seeing you.

382
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:51,085
My eyes are waiting to see you.

383
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:55,853
This crazy heart does
not listen to anything.

384
00:21:55,961 --> 00:22:00,796
Your stole smells like
flowers to me, beloved.

385
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:03,128
Love is like a disease.

386
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:05,497
No one should fall for it.

387
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:10,372
Your stole smells like
flowers to me, beloved.

388
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,635
Love is like a disease.

389
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,243
No one should fall for it.

390
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:20,216
Your stole smells like
flowers to me, beloved.

391
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,913
Smells like flowers to me,
beloved.

392
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,286
Oh! TaJ Mahal!

393
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:30,951
How much for this TaJ Mahal?

394
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,019
1500 baht.

395
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:33,798
All right. Yes.

396
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:35,729
Here you go.

397
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:37,095
Thank you. - Thank you.

398
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:40,469
You know, l love the TaJ Mahal.

399
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,371
Mumtaz was so lucky
that it was built for her.

400
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:45,803
l love you so much
that if you tell me..

401
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:48,472
..l will build a 10-storey
TaJ Mahal in Chandigarh.

402
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,011
Let it be.
The property rates are very high.

403
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:53,278
This is the memento of our love.

404
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,451
Don't ever separate
it from yourself.

405
00:22:57,823 --> 00:22:59,484
l'll always keep it with me.

406
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:02,123
lt's too small. Otherwise
l would have started staying in it.

407
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:03,361
You're too much.

408
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:05,361
Okay, listen.

409
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,091
As soon as we go back to lndia,
please talk to my brother.

410
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,656
l will convince your brother.

411
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,835
Just get ready for the engagement.

412
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:15,971
Congratulations for the engagement.

413
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,270
Hello. - Hello.

414
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:20,469
Hello. - Hello.

415
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,672
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

416
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:27,911
There are talks about making me
the president of Sardar Committee.

417
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,246
lf l become the president, then..

418
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:30,948
..l will get the guesthouse free
of cost during Seerat's wedding.

419
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:33,886
lt was so recent Seerat was so small.
Now she is of marriageable age.

420
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,519
Girls have to get married.
We can't keep them at home.

421
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:38,287
Anyway,
she wouldn't be at home much.

422
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:39,796
That's why she's
getting engaged so soon.

423
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,224
Brother, did you eat food?

424
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,392
l've eaten already.

425
00:23:43,702 --> 00:23:45,465
He eats before everyone.

426
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:46,697
Since he has to take his medicines.

427
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:48,302
What are you talking about?

428
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,301
Come, let me introduce
you to Seerat's fiancee.

429
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,137
He's come to the engagement too.

430
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,575
At least the engagement
will begin early.

431
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:01,419
Be happy.

432
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,455
He would be happy
when he was single.

433
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,620
l don't understand whether
to give him a gift or sympathy.

434
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,927
Congratulations.

435
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:10,760
Thank you.

436
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:13,230
He is Just getting married.

437
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:16,728
The amount of experience he has,
l think nothing will happen to him.

438
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:20,703
Why not? After marriage,
he'll at least become a father.

439
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,634
Brother, one second. l will Just come.
- Please, please.

440
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:26,143
Don't you want to drink?
- Come. Come.

441
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,213
Why are you sulking?
Where are your gift envelopes?

442
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:32,077
Hold this. l'll get some more.

443
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:35,081
l told you to get your wives along.

444
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,515
At least it would have created
a good impression in front of..

445
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,386
..Seerat's brother that
my friends are happily married.

446
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:42,491
lf they had come along, everything
would have been revealed.

447
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,958
Everyone would have come
to know how happily married we are.

448
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,322
And today is the last
day of your happy life.

449
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:50,333
At least let us
celebrate peacefully.

450
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:52,562
Then your life will
also become like ours.

451
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:57,101
l've torn all the old
pages of the book of my past.

452
00:24:58,477 --> 00:25:00,570
Then what's the use of the book?

453
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:03,380
Lucky! Lucky!

454
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:04,415
What happened? ls the alcohol over?

455
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,484
No. Your ex-girlfriend
Param is here.

456
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:07,717
She's totally drunk.

457
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,081
Oh gosh!

458
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:11,188
Hold this.
Where is she? - Over there.

459
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:12,683
Unlucky fellow.

460
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:13,888
He is gone.

461
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:18,490
He is in a mess..
he will be in trouble now.

462
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:20,526
The Prime Minister
has rightly said..

463
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:23,430
..the whole year,
have to tolerate this.

464
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:25,729
No one has said that.
You've made this nonsense up.

465
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:26,934
He's right.

466
00:25:27,506 --> 00:25:29,974
Try to understand.
Today is my engagement.

467
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:33,338
l'm starting my life afresh.
Please.

468
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:36,777
What did you think? That l've
come here to break your engagement?

469
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:38,615
No, Lucky.

470
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:41,608
l've truly loved you.

471
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:46,055
l've come to hug you one last time.

472
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,593
Please, Lucky.
Hug me one last time.

473
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:53,028
Param.. - From today,
you'll be someone else's forever.

474
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:54,024
Param..

475
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:56,299
Lucky, please don't refuse.

476
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:57,330
Param..

477
00:25:57,703 --> 00:26:01,730
Lucky, l'll become very lonely now.
Please, Lucky.

478
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:07,373
Lucky.. Lucky..

479
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:09,841
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

480
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,581
You're misunderstanding,
Seerat. l..

481
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,116
You're hugging her in front
of me and l'm misunderstanding?

482
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:20,883
Lucky.. Lucky..

483
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:23,385
Lucky.. Lucky..

484
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:30,460
So that was her last hug?

485
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:32,999
Yes.

486
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:36,899
The first hug still sounds better.

487
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,443
Doesn't the last hug sound strange?

488
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:42,541
The first and the
last one were together.

489
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:45,047
You mean two hugs?

490
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,443
No, no. One hug but two names.

491
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,048
Look, brother is already on
medication. Don't trouble him more.

492
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,594
Seerat, why are you so upset?

493
00:26:57,963 --> 00:26:59,055
What's my fault?

494
00:26:59,231 --> 00:26:59,856
Yes.

495
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:03,493
This is like dashing
into a parked car.

496
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,171
Brother,
please improve your language.

497
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:10,805
Please improve your
brother-in-law first.

498
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:14,671
Look, Seerat,
l don't know about the future..

499
00:27:15,614 --> 00:27:17,741
..but so far,
this boy seems innocent to me.

500
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:24,287
Or else these days, boys don't
restrict themselves only till a hug.

501
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:28,086
l think you should forgive him.

502
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:32,390
Lucky, l'm very sorry.

503
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:34,422
l misunderstood you the other day.

504
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:37,331
lt's okay. Next time, l won't
let any misunderstanding come up..

505
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:39,632
..that would create
problems between us. Okay?

506
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:40,631
Okay.

507
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:41,933
Whose phone is it?

508
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:43,472
Hello.

509
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:46,473
Lucky, go to Hotel
Park Plaza right now.

510
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:48,642
Hotel Park Plaza?
What's the matter?

511
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,742
Mandy is over there.

512
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:52,940
She says that if l don't
give my wife a divorce..

513
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:54,542
..and come there right away,
then she'll commit suicide.

514
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,150
l can't hear you. Hello.

515
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,618
Our lives are in danger
and you can't hear me.

516
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,280
You should have gone yourself.

517
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,157
l have to take my
wife for an ultrasound.

518
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:05,020
l can't hear you. Hello.

519
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:09,996
Listen to me. Be a man and
go to room no. 802 at the hotel.

520
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:11,565
Room no. 802?

521
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:13,768
Does that hotel have so many rooms?

522
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:14,836
You idiot!

523
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,874
Our lives are in danger and
you're concerned about the rooms?

524
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:17,839
Go there.

525
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:19,774
Mandy is sitting there
holding the sleeping pills..

526
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:21,608
..saying that if l don't come,
she'll pop them.

527
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:24,138
l think there's a problem
with the signal. Hello.

528
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:27,281
Even if there's no signal,
go there quickly.

529
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,013
Or else she'll consume
the sleeping pills..

530
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,452
..and my funeral will be conducted.

531
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:32,088
What? l'll have to come?

532
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:34,089
The custom officers have
seized our goods on a holiday?

533
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:37,519
No, no. l've come out with Seerat.

534
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:42,531
No, no. Even after so many misunder-
standings, she understands me.

535
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:43,757
Please continue.

536
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,663
The custom officers
have seized our goods.

537
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:46,704
At Hotel Park Plaza?

538
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:48,603
No, no. Our goods are
seized at the airport.

539
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:52,001
l have a meeting with the custom
officers at Park Plaza. - Oh!

540
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,476
l'll have to go. Can l..

541
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,976
Yes. l'm coming. l'm coming. Okay.

542
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:03,578
Looks like you've
studied in a convent.

543
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:06,018
Yes. Yes. How did you know?

544
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:07,956
You didn't read
the board behind you.

545
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,487
Should l read the board
or think about my goods?

546
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:13,325
Goods?

547
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,496
l'm worried about my goods
and he's concerned about the board.

548
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:18,798
The boy is nice,
but his destiny is bad.

549
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:22,269
ls bad.. destiny is bad.

550
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,774
He looks like a hero,
but is a bit dumb.

551
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,105
33, 34.
- Oh, my.

552
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:31,108
What's this? - Rs. 500.

553
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:33,514
You didn't see anything.
Did you understand? Go.

554
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:35,946
Mandy. Mandy. Mandy!

555
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,387
Brother, you?

556
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:42,391
You've reached 38 and 39.
How many pills did you consume?

557
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:44,655
Don't close your eyes.

558
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,166
Brother, l had told him that if he
didn't come here today, then l'll die.

559
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:51,634
We'll talk later, first vomit.

560
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:52,601
Okay.

561
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:55,068
Don't lie down! Vomit!

562
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,342
No.
- You'll have to vomit,

563
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,071
or else the police will
hang Jassi upside down.

564
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:01,237
Where are lemon and chilies?

565
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,077
Do you want to cook food?

566
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:06,174
Jassi will get into trouble.

567
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,553
Take this. Take this. Drink this.

568
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:15,719
No. First..
tell that scoundrel to come here.

569
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:19,092
We'll call him here. l'll make him
clean the vomit. You vomit first.

570
00:30:19,197 --> 00:30:19,993
Take this.

571
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:32,073
The cover.

572
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:33,372
The cover.

573
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:36,076
The cover of the salt box must
have gone in by mistake. Sorry.

574
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,340
All of you are fools!

575
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:39,848
l'll order coffee.

576
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,350
Hello. Send two coffees to room no.
802 quickly.

577
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:46,219
Brother, l'll be ruined.

578
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,986
l'll pay the bill.
You won't be ruined.

579
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,260
l don't mean that.

580
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:51,818
Whatever you mean,
Just sit straight.

581
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:54,229
You spoilt my Jacket.

582
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:57,234
Get up, you don't have to sleep.

583
00:30:57,302 --> 00:31:02,171
lf l don't marry Jassi,
then l'll be humiliated.

584
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,907
The coffee is here. Come in!

585
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:09,307
Don't worry. l'm with you.
You won't be humiliated.

586
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:17,812
Seerat, you're misunderstanding.

587
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:20,889
You're wearing your clothes in front
of me and l'm misunderstanding?

588
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,919
lt's nothing like that.
She vomited.

589
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,897
Oh, God!
The matter has reached this far?

590
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,727
She didn't do it because of me.

591
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:33,301
l did it because of you!
l did it because of you!

592
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,702
You idiot! Tell her the truth!
Why are you standing quietly?

593
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:39,503
Yes, madam.
Sir is telling the truth.

594
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,876
He gave me Rs. 500 and told
me not to tell anyone about it.

595
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:44,447
He saw everything.
He saw everything.

596
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:47,515
You idiot! Get out!

597
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:48,979
Listen to me.
l will explain.

598
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:52,247
The one she loves has left
her and gone to someone else.

599
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:55,253
Then why did you have
to leave her and come to me?

600
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,155
l.. - l'm going.
Don't try to contact me again.

601
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:00,464
Cheat!

602
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:02,264
Seerat..

603
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:04,099
She is gone.

604
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,297
Who was she, brother?

605
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:07,870
Couldn't you have called
me 'brother' in front of her?

606
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,839
Lucky..

607
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:23,381
But when Seerat saw you,
why were you wearing yourJacket?

608
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,045
Because l took it off.

609
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,317
Brother, at least let me complete.

610
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:29,652
Go and explain to your friends.

611
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:32,620
Brother, l'm telling the truth.
My only fault is that..

612
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,392
You forgot to lock the door.

613
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:37,494
No. That l went to save that girl.
- And got trapped yourself.

614
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:38,432
Yes. No..

615
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:40,361
l'll tell you the truth.

616
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:41,632
lf you are truthful..

617
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:44,036
then why did you tell the
waiter to keep his mouth shut?

618
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:45,107
What do l tell you?

619
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:46,666
You Just said that
you'll tell me everything.

620
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:48,938
l'll tell you everything, but..
What do l tell you?

621
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:53,573
Why do you trouble him?
Brother is already on medication.

622
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,212
Brother, at least listen to me.

623
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:58,453
Sorry, brother.

624
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:01,321
How many mistakes
will you apologize for?

625
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,791
Look, your explanation
doesn't prove you truthful.

626
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:09,800
But the pain in your voice
shows that you're unlucky.

627
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:11,799
But l can't do anything.

628
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:17,636
Seerat is furious. Until she
calms down, think with a cool head.

629
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:33,621
Come, Sunny. You've come.
- l've come.

630
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:34,681
The luggage has come too.

631
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,862
Our stuff has also almost
been shifted upstairs.

632
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:39,630
Set your things downstairs.

633
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:41,095
Hello. - This is my wife, Shanti.

634
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:43,827
Okay. Hello.
Will she also live with you?

635
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,499
lt would be expensive to
stay separately on rent, right?

636
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:50,574
Yes. Yes. Come.
- Why are you wet? Did it rain?

637
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:54,041
No, my son-in-law was here. Come.

638
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:57,247
Lucky, this has never
happened before..

639
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:59,040
..like it happened today.

640
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,880
lt is an insulting thing.

641
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:04,678
Tell me the truth.
They did not let you go inside?

642
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:08,088
He took me inside and told me..

643
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:14,423
The truth is that they did
not allow your brother inside.

644
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:16,696
We are permanent sons-in-law.

645
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:19,334
Our fathers-in-law
tell us to wait..

646
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:20,768
..for 10 minutes and
keep us standing at the gate.

647
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:22,304
At least they let you come in.

648
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:24,399
Consider this your respect.

649
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:26,501
You call this respect?

650
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:30,036
You should be shocked
if they respect you by mistake.

651
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:32,740
Disrespect and humiliation
is a routine matter, brother.

652
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:38,216
Lucky, all this has
happened because of me.

653
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,758
Now l'll set everything right.

654
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:44,017
l will directly go
and apologize to her.

655
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:49,963
l'll tell her, Sister-in-law, l'm
sorry, but you're not good enough.

656
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:53,229
We'll get our brother
Lucky married to someone else.

657
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:56,137
But what's the guarantee
that the other girl would be good?

658
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:59,708
Where do we find the
perfect wife for him?

659
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,946
All women have the
same kind of brains.

660
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,414
You have to repair
them the way you want.

661
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:09,549
Point. Point.
Point. - Point. Point.

662
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:11,278
See, l have a point.

663
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:14,516
Point. Point. - l'm talking
about the charging point.

664
00:35:14,692 --> 00:35:16,421
My phone's battery is exhausted.

665
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:18,722
lt's my birthday at 12 o'clock.

666
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:21,190
Who knows? Seerat might call me.

667
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,496
She might forgive him. Sister-in-law
might come here looking for him.

668
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:28,500
And she comes and wishes
you on your birthday.

669
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:31,574
Look, we don't want
to disturb sister-in-law.

670
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,973
We'll all sit in the car
and at 12 o'clock midnight..

671
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:37,276
..we'll go to
sister-in-law's house.

672
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:40,111
Point. Point.
Point. - Point. Point.

673
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:43,049
Point. Point.
Point. - Point. Point.

674
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:45,017
Neither is he intelligent..

675
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:49,082
..nor is he excellent.

676
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:53,624
Everyone suspects him.
But he is very innocent.

677
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:56,166
But he is very innocent.

678
00:35:56,768 --> 00:36:01,865
His impression is bad,
people think he is a fool.

679
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,304
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

680
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:09,813
Lucky, Just go and apologize
to her directly. End of discussion.

681
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:14,249
The gate is shut.
Should l dash with the gate?

682
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:16,444
YourJob is easy.

683
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:18,846
Resign from the engagement.

684
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:22,492
Will she agree if
l apologize to her?

685
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,390
lt is our brother's birthday
and she will not agree?

686
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:30,892
On this day, a person can convince
others' wives too. She's ours.

687
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:34,166
She's not ours. She's his.

688
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:36,401
He is ours too.

689
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:38,535
Tell me one thing.

690
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:41,741
l'll have to climb over this gate.

691
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:45,972
Of course. Do you think
they've made road with arrows..

692
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,678
..for their son-in-law to walk on?

693
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:52,479
You'll have to climb over.
Climb over.

694
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,554
l won't do it alone. Help me.

695
00:36:57,529 --> 00:37:01,363
Come on! - Coming! Coming! Coming!

696
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,500
Pick me up. - Pick up our tiger.

697
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:09,032
Go. Now l'll go and talk to her.

698
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,539
All the best! - Very good.

699
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,107
The gate is open.

700
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,968
Come! Get me down! Will
you come after l'm split in two?

701
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:17,739
We're here! We're here! We're here!

702
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,679
Do it faster.

703
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:21,049
Get me down.

704
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:22,885
Get him down.

705
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:27,983
Shanti.

706
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:30,617
Shanti.

707
00:37:31,596 --> 00:37:33,427
Your hair is so beautiful.

708
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,230
lf you get drunk and
trouble me like that..

709
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:37,766
..then l'll get my hair
chopped tomorrow morning.

710
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:39,564
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

711
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:43,004
May l go? - Where?

712
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:44,401
To the bathroom.

713
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:48,409
Oh, God! Why do you take
my permission for all this? Go!

714
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,144
Okay.

715
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:52,338
Thank you.

716
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:54,410
Coming soon.

717
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,090
Sorry. - You came back so soon?

718
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:04,090
Sorry.

719
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:07,592
Why do you drink so much that you
need to apologize so many times?

720
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:12,625
Sorry.

721
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,704
lf you apologize one more time,
then you'll see me dead. Sit.

722
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:18,234
Sit?

723
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:34,453
Sorry.

724
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:36,454
l had forbidden you
from apologizing, right?

725
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:37,425
When did you forbid me?

726
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:41,831
Are you going to hug me or should
l? - l'm hugging you, darling.

727
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:47,703
Hey! You got your hair cut already?

728
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:49,733
Who got her hair cut?

729
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,472
Why do you get angry?

730
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:55,045
We'll hug and sleep.
You'll be able to sleep again.

731
00:38:57,382 --> 00:38:58,747
Okay. Here you go.

732
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:00,779
Hug me.

733
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,119
l've hugged you.
Do you want me to strangle you now?

734
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:06,617
Strangle me.
Have l ever refused you?

735
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:08,985
Here you go! Harder?

736
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,126
You strangled me and l didn't
even come to know since l'm drunk?

737
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,094
l love you.

738
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:17,857
Your ears are so beautiful.

739
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:21,798
Where are your earrings?
- l have them on.

740
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:23,199
They are not there.

741
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,643
lf you touch alcohol tomorrow,
l'll cut your hands.

742
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:28,405
Okay, give me your other hand.

743
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:30,970
Thank you.

744
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:36,084
One, two, three..

745
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:39,882
Shanti, where did you
get the third hand from?

746
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:44,384
You don't see the earrings.
You see three hands.

747
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:46,854
No, there is a third hand.

748
00:39:46,998 --> 00:39:49,057
After a while, you'll say that
there is a fourth hand as well.

749
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,665
One, two, three, four..

750
00:39:51,736 --> 00:39:56,332
There is a fourth hand!
lt's someone! lt's someone!

751
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,775
The lights are turned on.

752
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:04,777
They're celebrating
our brother's birthday.

753
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:08,813
One day this was to happen.
lt has happened.

754
00:40:08,953 --> 00:40:09,977
Who are you?

755
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:11,619
Talk calmly.

756
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,015
Shanti? You have become so gutsy.

757
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,386
l Just went to the bathroom
and you called a man home!

758
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:20,090
What do you do after l go
to office? You're having an affair!

759
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:24,692
You come with me!
Come out! l'll teach you a lesson!

760
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:27,067
At least listen to me.
- l'll slap you!

761
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:29,402
l would listen
to you on bed. Witch!

762
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:30,939
What happened, Sunny?

763
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:32,372
l will not let anything happen.

764
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:33,910
What nonsense are you talking?

765
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:37,241
Really? You call men
in the house in my absence.

766
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:39,077
Look at this!

767
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:43,313
l caught the lovebirds
today red-handed, having fun!

768
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:45,055
Brother, l'm sorry.
l made a mistake..

769
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:48,251
Okay, so he accepts his mistake,
but you don't!

770
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:51,294
l'll tell you everything
from the beginning.

771
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:52,996
From the beginning? Really?

772
00:40:53,064 --> 00:40:54,463
How long have you
known each other..

773
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:57,363
..that you'll tell me from the beginning?
- l really don't know who he is.

774
00:40:57,468 --> 00:41:00,266
You knew him when
you were hugging him.

775
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:02,329
l'll take him to the
police station! - Brother.

776
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:04,599
lf you take family matters
to the police station..

777
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,873
..then people will start gossiping.

778
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:08,973
Brother,
why do you need the police?

779
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,273
Just kick him out yourself.

780
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:12,814
l'm ashamed, Shanti!

781
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,978
Get out from my house.

782
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:18,212
Rascal, you come
into people's houses.

783
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:22,489
l had told him to sleep calmly.
And he came to sleep with Shanti.

784
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,922
What will he do?

785
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:25,960
Oh gosh!

786
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:28,256
Our brother got beaten up.

787
00:41:28,366 --> 00:41:30,698
ls he Lucky or l am mistaken?

788
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:32,494
l was mistaken.

789
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,534
They erased all
my misunderstandings.

790
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,772
Nelson Mandela has rightly said..

791
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:41,937
..the whole year,
have to tolerate this.

792
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,215
When did Nelson Mandela
learn PunJabi idioms?

793
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:49,609
To hell with you! People don't
throw a dead rat out of the house..

794
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:52,220
..the way you've thrown
your alive son-in-law out.

795
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:55,019
Had they beaten him a little more..

796
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:58,154
..we would have to carry him on
our shoulders instead of our hands.

797
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:02,530
Seerat. - He's quite heavy.

798
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,397
Look, whatever it is..

799
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:09,136
..but we didn't like the way his
in-laws saw off their son-in-law.

800
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,467
They didn't see him off.
They switched him off.

801
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:16,610
Since Seerat has come into his life,
our tiger has turned into a dog.

802
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:19,046
Even a dog's plight isn't so
bad when it comes under a truck..

803
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,710
..the way his in-laws have
treated their son-in-law. - Yes.

804
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:24,019
A dog is smashed when
it comes under a truck..

805
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:26,248
..but his condition is even worse.

806
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:27,755
Listen to me.

807
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,850
Whether he came under
a truck or his in-laws..

808
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:31,493
..but he is our dog. - Yes.

809
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:33,496
Now the municipality
won't come and pick him up.

810
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:34,622
We'll have to pick him up.

811
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:36,426
What do you mean? - Seerat.

812
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:39,900
l mean, if this is his
state after the engagement..

813
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:42,401
..then what will they
do to him after the marriage?

814
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:46,732
Look, we will have to turn
our dog into a tiger again.

815
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:50,747
Don't make him a human.
You're only making him an animal.

816
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:52,305
lt means the same thing, uncle.

817
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,908
Uncle? People still flirt
with your sister-in-law.

818
00:42:55,987 --> 00:42:57,420
Why are you calling me uncle?

819
00:42:57,521 --> 00:43:01,753
We consider you our uncle. We don't
consider sister-in-law our aunt.

820
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,194
Dirty mind!

821
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:07,624
You finish off your problems
and then come to me.

822
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:09,563
Coming! Coming! Coming!

823
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:13,929
But l don't understand something.
How do we take him away from Seerat?

824
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:17,338
By fixing him up with someone else.

825
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,968
l know a homely model.

826
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:34,088
We will fix her with him.

827
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:35,754
The other one will come by herself.

828
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:37,326
l understood. - Yes.

829
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:40,426
This means we'll make
our brother a hunter. - Yes.

830
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:42,892
We'll send him to
a wild forest. - Yes.

831
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,692
And then we wait and watch.

832
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:46,630
Fight in the open.

833
00:43:46,704 --> 00:43:50,140
Shut up.
- Not fight, we have to wait.

834
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:53,038
You finish off your problems
and then come to me.

835
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,408
Coming! Coming! Coming!

836
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:09,081
Hey, Jassi!

837
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:10,858
Shefi darling.

838
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:14,997
We have a friend Lucky.

839
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,568
lf you succeed in befriending him..

840
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:21,263
..then you won't have
to work all your life.

841
00:44:21,672 --> 00:44:23,867
Oh, really? - Meet us tomorrow.

842
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:26,701
l have a very important modeling
assignment in Ludhiana tomorrow.

843
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:31,507
No problem. We'll come to Ludhiana.
Ludhiana isn't that far.

844
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,413
Right? - Coming! Coming! Coming!

845
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:37,485
Lucky.

846
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:48,588
Answer the phone!

847
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:52,129
Sukhi. - What are you doing?

848
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:54,466
l'm exercising. You know that
l've never skipped my exercise.

849
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:55,903
l've started doing
it since yesterday.

850
00:44:58,509 --> 00:44:59,999
Hello. - Hello, sister-in-law.

851
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:01,372
Hello, brother Dimpy.

852
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:04,446
Sorry. Sorry.
Who is it? Mrs. Siddhu?

853
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:08,050
Yes, speaking. Who are you?

854
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,553
l'm Sandhu. ls Mr. Siddhu there?

855
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:13,417
Yes, he is. Jassi. - Yes?

856
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:16,517
lt's Mr. Sandhu's call.
- lt's Sandhu's call?

857
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:18,685
What work does he have with me?

858
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:20,757
Hello. Mr. Sandhu.

859
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:23,729
Now say whatever you feel like.
Come on, start.

860
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:25,959
No, no. Even if my
house catches fire..

861
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,435
..l won't go out
on Saturday and Sunday.

862
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:31,303
No, brother. What's the big deal?
l know that Rs. 15-20 lakhs..

863
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:33,172
..is a very big amount.

864
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:35,743
But never mind, brother.
Money is not everything.

865
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:38,337
What could happen? We'll become
poor. Our house will be sold.

866
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,906
We'll come on the street, right?

867
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:43,485
Never mind. My child won't
study in a convent school.

868
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:45,146
He'll study in a municipal school.

869
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:46,788
Even after completing
his education..

870
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:48,415
..he's going to be at
home on weekends with his wife.

871
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:49,920
No, brother. lt's not a problem.

872
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:51,927
My wife will stitch
sweaters for people.

873
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:53,892
She'll stitches clothes for people.

874
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,693
She'll give tuitions
to people's children.

875
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,996
No work on Saturdays and Sundays.
Okay, bye.

876
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:03,964
Listen. You shouldn't avoid work.

877
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:05,503
Your work is important.

878
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:07,671
Go to Ludhiana and
attend the meeting.

879
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:09,439
Then l'll come back soon,
l'm telling you.

880
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,208
Even if the meeting
is left halfway.

881
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:12,573
So sweet!

882
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:16,418
Tulsi! Tulsi,
answer the phone quickly! - Yes

883
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,079
lt'll get disconnected. - Yes.

884
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,290
Hello. - Hello.
l'm a doctor for children.

885
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:26,855
Our child is playing right now.
Please call later.

886
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:30,000
l'm a doctor for children, but l
will have to talk to elders, right?

887
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:35,862
Mr. Brar told me that
your child gets attacks. - Yes.

888
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,631
Do one thing. Give all
the medical reports to Mr. Brar..

889
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:40,472
..and send him to my
clinic in Ludhiana today.

890
00:46:40,544 --> 00:46:41,408
l'll check everything.

891
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,376
Today? - You'll have
to send him tomorrow.

892
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:47,017
Actually, there's veneration
in my clinic tomorrow.

893
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:48,273
Veneration in the clinic?

894
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:50,615
Look, you don't know
much about medicine.

895
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:52,050
We have to perform the veneration.

896
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:54,019
But will our child be cured?

897
00:46:54,158 --> 00:46:55,750
Only a doctor can tell you that.

898
00:46:55,926 --> 00:46:58,918
What? - No, no.
l'll tell you. l'm a doctor.

899
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,995
He'll be cured completely.

900
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:03,666
Even if he becomes a minister when
he grows up, he won't fall sick.

901
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:05,296
Okay.

902
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:10,264
Who was it? - Mr. Brar, it
was a doctor's call from Ludhiana.

903
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:12,533
Now our Chaku's epilepsy
will be cured completely.

904
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:16,011
Yes, mother. l'm fed
up of smelling father's shoes.

905
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:19,111
Son, l buy new shoes every week
so that it doesn't smell too much.

906
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,210
l haven't spent on your medicines as
much as l have spent on buying shoes.

907
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,287
But l didn't understand something.

908
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:27,219
Why was the doctor talking about
performing veneration in his clinic?

909
00:47:27,324 --> 00:47:28,586
He had to do that.

910
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:31,453
He has sinned by performing
female feticides in his clinic.

911
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:33,286
Let's go. - Where are you going?

912
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:36,159
You don't have to perform
veneration over there.

913
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:37,829
lt has come.

914
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,540
Listen. - What is it?

915
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:47,506
Answer the phone.
l'm playing games.

916
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:49,073
l'm watching TV.

917
00:47:57,254 --> 00:47:58,050
Hello.

918
00:47:59,023 --> 00:48:00,149
You answered the phone yourself?

919
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:01,747
What do l do?
She doesn't listen to me.

920
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:03,883
My desire to talk to sister-in-law
remained unfulfilled.

921
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:05,755
Start the scheme.

922
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,058
You're totally a henpecked husband.

923
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,028
We feel ashamed to
call you our friend.

924
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:13,102
Now say whatever you have to.

925
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:14,735
What did you say?

926
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:18,304
l'll have to come to Ludhiana
for aJob interview? Tomorrow?

927
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:20,439
Okay. l'll talk to them..

928
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:22,778
l mean, l'll talk
to my wife about it.

929
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,674
Go wherever you want to,
but talk softly.

930
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:28,084
Brother-in-law,
do you have to go to Ludhiana?

931
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:30,414
Take me along too.
lt's my date tomorrow in Ludhiana.

932
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,019
Or else l will have
to struggle and go by bus.

933
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,487
What? The venue for
the interview has changed?

934
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,450
lt's in Delhi now?

935
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:36,220
lt's strange.
You change venues in a minute.

936
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:39,929
Anyway, l'll come to Delhi.
Okay? Bye.

937
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:42,925
The venue for the
interview has changed.

938
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:44,163
l'm going to Delhi now.

939
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:45,667
But your arm is going
towards Ludhiana.

940
00:48:45,736 --> 00:48:46,703
Sit on it and go.

941
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,431
Fine. l'll go by bus.

942
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,097
My brother-in-law
is a miser anyway.

943
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:03,545
Lucky!

944
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:06,048
Lucky!

945
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:09,120
What have you told him
about where we're going?

946
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:11,185
l've told him that there's
an important meeting..

947
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:13,559
..of his import and export business.
What else could l have told him?

948
00:49:15,633 --> 00:49:17,965
Which meeting are you
going to attend wearing shorts?

949
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:20,528
What's the problem?
l had worn shorts when l went to..

950
00:49:20,604 --> 00:49:21,571
..meet your sister-in-law
for the first time.

951
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,402
lt's different that they
didn't show sister-in-law to him..

952
00:49:23,474 --> 00:49:24,839
..saying that the
boy's legs are thin.

953
00:49:25,142 --> 00:49:27,337
Did they want to make me
ride bicycles seeing my thin legs?

954
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:29,240
Get lost.
l don't want to go with you.

955
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:32,307
You're talking as if we've not
worn shorts, but taken them off.

956
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:33,541
At least let's go to
the venue of the meeting.

957
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:34,777
We'll change our clothes there.

958
00:49:34,952 --> 00:49:36,920
l've seen your faces
early in the morning.

959
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:38,011
l wonder how the
rest of the day will be.

960
00:49:38,122 --> 00:49:41,319
Really? You were kissing
us at night when you were drunk.

961
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:43,690
My brothers! My brothers!

962
00:49:44,728 --> 00:49:46,252
ln the morning, you can't stand us.

963
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,090
We've made so many efforts
for your business. Sit.

964
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,791
Come on. Come on, sit.
- Keep his bag behind.

965
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,537
Move behind.

966
00:49:57,574 --> 00:49:58,836
He always acts as
a hero all the time.

967
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:01,142
Come on.

968
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,842
You'll drink beer
and go for the meeting?

969
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:11,621
Why do you get angry?
We won't go for the meeting.

970
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:14,253
l want to get down.

971
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,650
You're already under
your future wife's feet.

972
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,125
How much lower
do you want to stoop?

973
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:21,692
People get nervous in meetings.

974
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:23,795
lf you're drunk,
you don't feel humiliated.

975
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:25,396
Take this.
You drink too. Take this.

976
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:27,629
Tell me the truth.
Where are you taking me?

977
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:30,170
Ludhiana.
To celebrate your birthday.

978
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:32,205
My birthday was
celebrated last night.

979
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:33,800
l am being born since last night!

980
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:36,269
And l haven't told Seerat.

981
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:37,710
You had gone last night.

982
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:40,213
Your in-laws gave you
auspicious gifts by beating you.

983
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:42,711
Stop the car!

984
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,679
l told you to stop the
car and not to bump into one!

985
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:47,280
They have dashed my auto.

986
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,426
Who is the rascal!

987
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:51,591
Your sister..

988
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:52,821
Are you crazy

989
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:54,329
l will show you..

990
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:55,893
He's my brother-in-law.

991
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:58,826
l told my brother-in-law
that l was going to Delhi.

992
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:01,603
Listen. Your brother-in-law
drives a rickshaw?

993
00:51:01,905 --> 00:51:04,339
You said your in-laws
are very rich?

994
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:06,575
Today we came to know his reality.

995
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:07,837
The rickshaw driver
was driving slowly.

996
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,810
l was in a hurry.
So l told him to let me drive.

997
00:51:10,681 --> 00:51:12,808
But you were going
to Delhi for an interview.

998
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:14,611
You stopped us, otherwise
l would have reached by now.

999
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:15,878
But this route leads to Ludhiana.

1000
00:51:17,388 --> 00:51:20,789
l see. Someone told us
that Ludhiana is that way. - Yes.

1001
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:22,257
People are crazy.

1002
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,358
But where are you going
wearing such clothes?

1003
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:26,293
Tell the truth to me.

1004
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:28,354
How can l tell you the truth?
l don't know the truth myself.

1005
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:30,165
Actually, we didn't tell him.

1006
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,065
Actually, his fiancee is upset.

1007
00:51:32,236 --> 00:51:34,295
We're going to Ludhiana
to pacify his fiancee.

1008
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:36,236
l see. So take me along too.

1009
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,841
l have to go to the court along
with my lawyer. l'm getting late.

1010
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:41,069
And l won't tell sister that you..

1011
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:44,078
Do something.

1012
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:46,943
Otherwise he will
go home and squeal on me.

1013
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:47,808
Say something.

1014
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:51,080
The one for whom you are begging,
he has gone and sat in the car.

1015
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:52,549
Come on. - Come on.

1016
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:54,681
Stop here. l have to get off here.

1017
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:00,761
Thank you. see you later.

1018
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:06,165
So the model will
stay with us? - Yes.

1019
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:08,696
Why? - She's complimentary.

1020
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:10,403
Actually, my friend..

1021
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:13,776
..we couldn't bear to see you
crying for sister-in-law last night.

1022
00:52:14,111 --> 00:52:17,603
We came to our senses
and called Shefi.

1023
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,746
Just forget everything for once.

1024
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,316
Then Just wait and watch
how you fall for Shefi's beauty.

1025
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,846
lf you don't,
we will request for another one.

1026
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:28,687
l can't do this! - lf we can do it,
then you can do it too.

1027
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,783
Do you intend to get
me married or ruin my life?

1028
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:32,055
Listen to me, brother.

1029
00:52:32,129 --> 00:52:34,689
Since she has seen your photo,
she is after us.

1030
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:36,833
The photo is not clear.
Show the guy in reality.

1031
00:52:36,967 --> 00:52:38,195
So we have come here.

1032
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:39,030
Get lost.

1033
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,033
Coming.

1034
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:45,403
Jassi! - Hey, Shefi!

1035
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:47,543
Hi! - How are you, my love?
Good to see you.

1036
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:49,609
Meet my friend, Guri.
- Hi. Guri Brar.

1037
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,508
And..

1038
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:53,507
Actually he is Dimpy.

1039
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:58,244
Jassi, where were you? Neither
do you call, nor do you meet.

1040
00:52:58,689 --> 00:53:00,384
l'm so sorry, darling.

1041
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:02,322
Actually,
those new, struggling models..

1042
00:53:02,392 --> 00:53:03,825
..keep calling me
up and harassing me.

1043
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:05,452
So l keep changing
my mobile numbers.

1044
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:07,623
By the way, this is my new office.

1045
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:09,358
This contains all my numbers.

1046
00:53:09,566 --> 00:53:11,431
This is our boy who's born today.

1047
00:53:12,102 --> 00:53:14,400
He's born today?
And he's grown so big?

1048
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:17,267
l was born today.

1049
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:19,373
Oh! lt's your birthday! - Yes.

1050
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:20,601
Happy birthday.

1051
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,340
l think it's my birthday too.

1052
00:53:25,382 --> 00:53:26,349
lt's a nice room.

1053
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:28,778
We got it on a special request.

1054
00:53:29,086 --> 00:53:30,883
We told them to give
us the honeymoon suite.

1055
00:53:31,054 --> 00:53:32,487
We will share it.

1056
00:53:32,589 --> 00:53:33,954
Let's cut the cake and leave.

1057
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:36,923
Do you have to go
somewhere else? - Yes.

1058
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:40,626
Yes, he has to go to a
few more places to cut cakes.

1059
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:44,297
Like ministers go to inaugurate
places and cut ribbons..

1060
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,026
..people call him to cut cakes.

1061
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:48,530
l don't know about cake..

1062
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:50,596
..but l'll surely slit
a few people's necks today.

1063
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:51,537
Why are you getting angry?

1064
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:53,576
As soon as you cut the cake,
you can leave.

1065
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:56,372
l think he's got the beers.

1066
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:00,376
Brother-in-law.

1067
00:54:00,884 --> 00:54:02,112
Sir, seeing your car..

1068
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:03,811
..he said that he wanted
to meet the owner of the car.

1069
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:05,319
Do you know him? - Yes.

1070
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:07,651
Recognize me. - Yes. Yes.

1071
00:54:09,426 --> 00:54:12,623
Such a brother-in-law deserves
to be abused. - Absolutely.

1072
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:13,956
What have you come here for?

1073
00:54:14,064 --> 00:54:16,532
l forgot my bag in the car. But..

1074
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:19,830
Who's she?

1075
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,498
She?

1076
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:24,306
She.. she..

1077
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:26,601
lt slipped my mind. She is..

1078
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:28,577
She is Lucky's fiancee. - Yes.

1079
00:54:28,645 --> 00:54:29,737
Fiancee. - No, no.

1080
00:54:30,047 --> 00:54:31,537
She's his fiancee
and he is denying it.

1081
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:33,774
No, no. She's angry with him.

1082
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:35,316
So he thinks that their
relationship is over.

1083
00:54:35,485 --> 00:54:37,112
Relationships don't
break like that.

1084
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:39,222
Your fiancee is related
to you by blood.

1085
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,917
A fiancee is a fiancee,
no matter what. - Yes.

1086
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:44,550
l see. You came
to pacify her. - Yes.

1087
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:47,126
Are you pacified?
- You don't come between them.

1088
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:48,389
They're trying to
solve their problems..

1089
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:49,499
..and you're trying to
create a fight between them?

1090
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,431
lt's his birthday.
He's waiting to cut the cake.

1091
00:54:52,336 --> 00:54:54,201
Come on, let's cut it.
- You stop right there.

1092
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:57,238
Because of your interference,
you haven't become an uncle yet.

1093
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:59,207
Come on.
Get him out. Come on. - Come on.

1094
00:54:59,343 --> 00:55:01,140
Where are you all going?

1095
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:03,176
We're going to get a pastry
for him. You have the cake.

1096
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:08,411
lnstead of having a brother-in-law
like him, it's better to die a bachelor.

1097
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:10,486
Dimpy, give him his bag.

1098
00:55:11,154 --> 00:55:12,849
Take this. And get lost.

1099
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:17,220
lf l hadn't married my sister to you,
l would have taught you a lesson.

1100
00:55:17,427 --> 00:55:18,860
Take your sister back
and teach me a lesson.

1101
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:19,791
Are you happy now?

1102
00:55:20,163 --> 00:55:21,824
Get lost now.
What are you waiting for?

1103
00:55:22,065 --> 00:55:24,659
You'll miss your bus. - Get lost.

1104
00:55:25,802 --> 00:55:27,997
So, how many
girlfriends do you have?

1105
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:29,934
One.

1106
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:32,498
Just one? Why not two?

1107
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:35,437
Nowadays even mobile
phones have progressed.

1108
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:37,611
You can insert two
SlM cards in them.

1109
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:39,613
lt's all about time.

1110
00:55:39,816 --> 00:55:41,977
There was a time when even
l would insert six to seven..

1111
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:43,609
..SlM cards in one cell phone.

1112
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:45,013
Naughty!

1113
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:49,788
There are many
friends in the world.

1114
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,791
But friends like us are very rare.

1115
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:56,524
We cunningly brought our friend out of
Seerat's problem and fixed him here.

1116
00:55:57,934 --> 00:56:01,062
Don't you think we've
been too sincere? - How?

1117
00:56:01,571 --> 00:56:03,766
We didn't look for such
a beautiful girl for ourselves.

1118
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:05,599
We worked so hard
to find her for him.

1119
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:08,477
Who is Seerat to
ruin our friend's life?

1120
00:56:09,112 --> 00:56:11,410
Are we dead?
We will ruin our friend's life.

1121
00:56:13,684 --> 00:56:16,050
lt's been quite long
since we left them alone.

1122
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:21,016
They must have fallen
for each other by now.

1123
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:38,932
Glass is risky.
Moreover, it fell.

1124
00:56:39,142 --> 00:56:41,542
She might step
on it while dancing.

1125
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:44,044
Hold her. She might fall.

1126
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:46,014
Hold her. She might fall.

1127
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:50,982
Glass is risky.
Moreover, it fell.

1128
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:53,648
She might step
on it while dancing.

1129
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:56,258
Hold her. She might fall.

1130
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,121
l am a beauty like no other.

1131
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:01,496
l'm a pretty girl.

1132
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:04,663
Drive you crazy. Just look at me.

1133
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:06,792
l'm your cutie girl.

1134
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:10,471
The girl's hair-clip
has fallen down.

1135
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:12,800
Hair-clip has fallen.

1136
00:57:12,909 --> 00:57:15,810
The boy's keep lifting them.

1137
00:57:20,183 --> 00:57:22,583
The girl's hair-clip
has fallen down.

1138
00:57:22,652 --> 00:57:24,984
The boy's keep lifting them.

1139
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:27,522
The veil is colourful.

1140
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:29,988
The veil is colourful.

1141
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:32,423
We love that.

1142
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:35,387
l am a beauty like no other.

1143
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:37,923
l'm a pretty girl.

1144
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:41,099
Drive you crazy. Just look at me.

1145
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:43,603
l'm your cutie girl.

1146
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:46,875
The anklet has broken,
pick it up.

1147
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,144
The anklet.

1148
00:57:49,246 --> 00:57:51,680
And our eyes have met.

1149
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,886
The anklet has broken,
pick it up.

1150
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:01,287
And our eyes have met.

1151
00:58:01,424 --> 00:58:03,688
Because of this, l can't sleep.

1152
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:06,125
l can't sleep.

1153
00:58:06,263 --> 00:58:08,663
l can't work.

1154
00:58:08,865 --> 00:58:11,265
Glass is risky.

1155
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:13,459
Moreover, it fell.

1156
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:18,634
She might step on it while
dancing. Hold her. She might fall.

1157
00:58:21,077 --> 00:58:23,238
Hold her. She might fall.

1158
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:28,075
Hold her. She might fall.

1159
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:36,249
We have seen a very positive dream
about Lucky. lt should turn true.

1160
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,187
How will it not turn true?

1161
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:40,595
Those who make efforts.

1162
00:58:41,097 --> 00:58:42,621
Couples are made by God.

1163
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,929
Come on, Lucky. Be modern.

1164
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:47,296
l request you.
Please let me be lndian.

1165
00:58:47,404 --> 00:58:48,837
Lucky, it's the 21st century.

1166
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:51,271
Even in the 19th century,
my grandpa had five girlfriends.

1167
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:52,803
But l'm happy with one.

1168
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:54,810
Lucky, your life will be made.

1169
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:56,707
My fiancee will kill me.

1170
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,974
You're so scared.

1171
00:58:58,148 --> 00:58:59,877
l'm scared of you more than her.

1172
00:59:00,684 --> 00:59:01,946
You don't understand.

1173
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:04,610
Sit here and explain whatever
you want to. Sit here.

1174
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:06,917
l really like you.

1175
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:08,988
lt's strange.
People don't like statuses on..

1176
00:59:09,092 --> 00:59:11,083
..Facebook so soon
and you like me already?

1177
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:13,962
l think l should go. Bye.

1178
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:16,561
Will you go Just like that? - Move!

1179
00:59:17,767 --> 00:59:19,530
You pushed me? Get lost!

1180
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:39,020
Sorry.

1181
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:44,489
Sorry.

1182
00:59:48,698 --> 00:59:49,687
Move away.

1183
00:59:51,568 --> 00:59:52,694
Why did you do this to me?

1184
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:54,460
Yes! it was good?

1185
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:56,999
So, didn't we do the right thing?

1186
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,871
Let me test him first.

1187
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:00,903
He Just let go of his self-respect.

1188
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:04,378
Tell me. Who is Seerat?
- She's my fiancee!

1189
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:05,505
He still hasn't forgotten her.

1190
01:00:05,615 --> 01:00:08,083
What did you think?
That l would stoop so low?

1191
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:10,718
You brought her for me,
but l pushed her and left.

1192
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:13,288
You didn't push Shefi,
but your own fate.

1193
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:16,392
You got him humiliated.
- Talk about me. l was humiliated.

1194
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:18,859
Yes, he was humiliated.
He had found the girl.

1195
01:00:19,029 --> 01:00:20,792
When l was a kid,
my parents had told me..

1196
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:23,225
..in life do anything..

1197
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,561
..but you should not
do anything bad to a girl.

1198
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:29,163
You should have modified your
parents' wise advices along with you.

1199
01:00:30,273 --> 01:00:31,706
l'll go and pacify her.
You really humiliated her.

1200
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:33,705
Hello. Where are you going?
Let me go.

1201
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,276
Why will you go, you idiot? l..

1202
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:38,680
Brother, she's angry with you.

1203
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:41,146
You know that l can tackle
such situations very well.

1204
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:42,307
Let me go.

1205
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:46,180
You can't tackle your regular TV.
You want to tackle a temporary TV.

1206
01:00:46,489 --> 01:00:48,286
l will curse you if you stop me.
l'm going.

1207
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:49,791
Come here! Come here!

1208
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:52,089
Are we dead?
Are we dead? Tell me. Are we dead?

1209
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:53,092
l'll go.

1210
01:00:53,296 --> 01:00:54,695
Get lost!
Whoever wants to go can go!

1211
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:57,932
Why are you behaving like that?
Are you kids?

1212
01:00:58,601 --> 01:00:59,727
We must decide maturely.

1213
01:00:59,803 --> 01:01:02,033
Tell me, who will decide maturely?
- l will decide maturely.

1214
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,402
Do it. - Come here.

1215
01:01:15,151 --> 01:01:16,413
l won! l won!

1216
01:01:16,486 --> 01:01:17,714
l'm going! l'm going!

1217
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:24,158
Which idiot suggested
this stupid idea? - You did.

1218
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:26,421
Shefi.

1219
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:28,593
Shefi.

1220
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:30,561
Shefi.

1221
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:34,665
No, no. No one fell.

1222
01:01:35,372 --> 01:01:36,805
He said there was
a tiff between them.

1223
01:01:36,906 --> 01:01:38,373
But it looks like there
was a big fight here.

1224
01:01:39,743 --> 01:01:40,505
Ms. Shefi.

1225
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:42,841
Shefi.

1226
01:01:51,354 --> 01:01:53,345
Rascal, did our wives come here?

1227
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:57,452
Why are you screaming? Did
your hand get stuck in the door?

1228
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:00,724
Did the ulcer burst
in your stomach?

1229
01:02:00,797 --> 01:02:03,322
She's killed!
She's killed! Shefi is killed!

1230
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,524
You killed Shefi?

1231
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:05,964
He has killed her.

1232
01:02:06,036 --> 01:02:08,504
l haven't lost my mind.
l Just pushed her.

1233
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:10,332
She's dead.
Her corpse is lying there.

1234
01:02:10,707 --> 01:02:13,267
How do you know that she's dead?
Did you check her curves?

1235
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:15,607
lt's not 'curves'. lt's 'nerves'.
- Whatever it is, did you check it?

1236
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:17,747
Did you talk to the
corpse face to face?

1237
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:19,343
Did the corpse tell
you that it's dead?

1238
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:20,848
There is so much blood over there!

1239
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,076
How can there be too much blood?

1240
01:02:22,152 --> 01:02:23,949
Her hemoglobin doesn't
seem to be much.

1241
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,352
You'll come to know when
we'll be charged under section 302.

1242
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:28,391
And all of us! Yes!

1243
01:02:28,491 --> 01:02:30,049
She is covered in blood!

1244
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:32,354
You idiot!
Some nerve must have been cut.

1245
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:33,894
You've created chaos in the hotel.

1246
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:37,533
Nerve is not cut.
We're ruined! All of us are ruined!

1247
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:38,793
We're finished! We're finished!

1248
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:41,060
l think this guy is lying.

1249
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:43,105
Let's go and see what he's done!

1250
01:02:43,273 --> 01:02:46,367
Do more mischief.
- Oh gosh! What has he done?

1251
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,837
Unlucky story.

1252
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,277
Unlucky story.

1253
01:02:59,854 --> 01:03:01,151
You really killed her!

1254
01:03:01,223 --> 01:03:02,053
l didn't kill her!

1255
01:03:02,123 --> 01:03:04,853
The whole year,
have to tolerate this.

1256
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,086
No one has said that.

1257
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:08,626
Not for a year, you will
be stuck for your whole life.

1258
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,127
We will be hanged!

1259
01:03:10,398 --> 01:03:11,922
l Just pushed her.

1260
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,524
You've pushed many others before.

1261
01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:15,968
What are you saying?
Maybe she committed suicide.

1262
01:03:16,037 --> 01:03:19,768
Would she commit suicide here?
She was earning good money.

1263
01:03:19,874 --> 01:03:22,900
Listen, we're friends.
We'll have to stay united.

1264
01:03:23,311 --> 01:03:26,075
Lucky, l'll get food
for you in Jail myself.

1265
01:03:26,147 --> 01:03:27,136
Stop your nonsense!

1266
01:03:27,282 --> 01:03:29,147
l'll call at the police station
and call the police right now.

1267
01:03:29,217 --> 01:03:30,775
Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

1268
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:33,285
You'll call the police?
What if our wives come to know?

1269
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:35,946
The punishment and the
divorce will happen together.

1270
01:03:36,124 --> 01:03:38,718
When l haven't murdered her, why
are you scared to call the police?

1271
01:03:39,094 --> 01:03:40,425
Enough! End of discussion.

1272
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:43,755
Those who don't want the police
to be called, raise your hands.

1273
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:44,388
Here you go.

1274
01:03:44,466 --> 01:03:46,127
One. Two. Three. Four.

1275
01:03:46,268 --> 01:03:47,929
This means none of us
wants the police to be called.

1276
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:49,663
End of discussion.
- But l didn't raise my hand.

1277
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:51,069
You refuse everything.

1278
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:52,265
You murdered her and refused.

1279
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:53,841
What kind of friends are you?

1280
01:03:54,009 --> 01:03:56,443
You're falsely accusing
your friend of murder.

1281
01:03:56,811 --> 01:03:58,278
No, what will we tell the police?

1282
01:03:58,346 --> 01:03:59,779
That the nuts of the fan came off..

1283
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:01,712
..and the girl died
coming under the fan?

1284
01:04:01,783 --> 01:04:04,149
ls she a girl or a bird
that got stuck in a fan and died?

1285
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,844
The police will open our nuts,
that too without greasing.

1286
01:04:06,988 --> 01:04:09,650
Tell me something.
What's the punishment for a murder?

1287
01:04:09,824 --> 01:04:11,587
Almost death penalty.

1288
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,287
And for four people?
- Almost..

1289
01:04:14,963 --> 01:04:16,624
What do you mean four people,
brother?

1290
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:17,993
Hello. Listen to me.

1291
01:04:18,066 --> 01:04:20,159
We're not saying that
you murdered her. Right?

1292
01:04:20,368 --> 01:04:23,303
But how will we explain to the
police? You tell me. You're wise.

1293
01:04:23,438 --> 01:04:25,429
None of us know to hide a corpse.

1294
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:27,199
Whenever an old person
died in our family..

1295
01:04:27,309 --> 01:04:28,571
..we took them directly
to the graveyard.

1296
01:04:28,677 --> 01:04:30,304
Do others take them
to the rose garden?

1297
01:04:30,512 --> 01:04:31,240
Crazy man!

1298
01:04:31,346 --> 01:04:32,472
Okay, listen to me.

1299
01:04:32,547 --> 01:04:38,076
Until we arrange to get rid of the
corpse, you will guard the corpse.

1300
01:04:39,587 --> 01:04:40,952
He's telling you.

1301
01:04:41,022 --> 01:04:42,319
Why should l sit with the corpse?

1302
01:04:42,657 --> 01:04:44,750
Who won lnky pinky ponky?

1303
01:04:44,859 --> 01:04:46,554
You were dancing
with Joy on winning!

1304
01:04:46,695 --> 01:04:48,993
l will never play lnky
pinky ponky again in my life!

1305
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:50,758
Come, brother.
- Let's make arrangements.

1306
01:04:50,865 --> 01:04:55,097
Listen. Hello. Until we return, cover
the corpse and gather the things.

1307
01:05:11,152 --> 01:05:12,949
Unlucky story.

1308
01:05:14,522 --> 01:05:16,353
Unlucky story.

1309
01:05:17,926 --> 01:05:19,393
Unlucky story.

1310
01:05:33,775 --> 01:05:35,936
What happened?
Did someone else die? - No.

1311
01:05:36,111 --> 01:05:38,238
We told you to sit with the corpse.

1312
01:05:38,513 --> 01:05:39,980
l feel scared over there.

1313
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:41,941
But why have you brought this?

1314
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:43,540
We'll take the corpse in this.

1315
01:05:43,618 --> 01:05:44,209
ln the lentil?

1316
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,254
lt's not your lentil.
- But it's lentil.

1317
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:52,054
You've driven us crazy.
Did you drive the corpse crazy too?

1318
01:05:52,227 --> 01:05:54,991
ldiot! We'll put the corpse
underneath and take it out.

1319
01:05:57,198 --> 01:05:59,826
ls it the police's call?
- l'll have to answer it.

1320
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:00,992
Not me.

1321
01:06:01,169 --> 01:06:05,105
Hello. Yes, Gurinder Brar speaking.
Who are you?

1322
01:06:06,074 --> 01:06:07,302
Meenakshi? - Meenakshi?

1323
01:06:07,442 --> 01:06:09,603
From where?
From the bank? - From the bank?

1324
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:11,072
What do you want?

1325
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:13,537
Shut up! - What happened?

1326
01:06:13,681 --> 01:06:15,979
We might get arrested here
and she wants me to take a loan.

1327
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:17,584
You should have taken the loan.

1328
01:06:17,685 --> 01:06:19,346
We could use it to fight
the case in the future.

1329
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:22,857
Looking at our condition, we would
get the draft of the loan in prison.

1330
01:06:22,924 --> 01:06:24,221
Come on. Take the trolley.

1331
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:33,992
Lucky, l found this
under on the bed.

1332
01:06:36,037 --> 01:06:37,231
Put it inside.

1333
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:41,003
Take it. Take it. Hurry up.
Nothing should be left out.

1334
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:42,799
Come on.

1335
01:06:46,714 --> 01:06:48,443
Unlucky story.

1336
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:51,948
Unlucky story.

1337
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:54,980
Unlucky story.

1338
01:06:59,627 --> 01:07:01,094
Bring it fast.
- They put my Jacket on the corpse.

1339
01:07:01,196 --> 01:07:03,164
Take off the Jacket first.
Take off the Jacket.

1340
01:07:03,832 --> 01:07:05,629
Did you have only
my Jacket to do this?

1341
01:07:05,733 --> 01:07:07,724
l will have to get it dry-cleaned.

1342
01:07:08,837 --> 01:07:10,737
Do fast.

1343
01:07:12,207 --> 01:07:13,674
Sit in the car. Sit.

1344
01:07:14,042 --> 01:07:15,771
Did you see? - He saw?

1345
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,138
Did you see? - He saw?

1346
01:07:17,212 --> 01:07:19,305
Did you see?
l came before you left.

1347
01:07:20,615 --> 01:07:21,707
What's the matter?
Why do you look so scared as..

1348
01:07:21,816 --> 01:07:22,805
..if you've buried
the girl and come?

1349
01:07:23,084 --> 01:07:25,518
We have to go to bury her. No..

1350
01:07:25,687 --> 01:07:28,884
We broke the vessels of the hotel.
That's why we're scared.

1351
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,754
You're so scared as if
you didn't break the vessels..

1352
01:07:30,859 --> 01:07:32,326
..but stole the
vessels of the hotel.

1353
01:07:32,393 --> 01:07:34,156
Brother, even if you
accuse us of stealing..

1354
01:07:34,262 --> 01:07:35,695
..the soap case
of the hotel today..

1355
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:37,094
..then we'll accept that as well.

1356
01:07:37,632 --> 01:07:38,860
Right, brother.

1357
01:07:39,834 --> 01:07:40,823
Where is sister-in-law?

1358
01:07:41,302 --> 01:07:42,394
Over here. - Over here?

1359
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:45,405
He means to say that
after you left, she left too.

1360
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:50,277
Strange. l have heard this line
many times before, but not this way.

1361
01:07:50,478 --> 01:07:53,345
Are you a master of PunJabi? You're
pointing our mistakes in PunJabi.

1362
01:07:53,481 --> 01:07:54,709
What have you come here for?

1363
01:07:54,782 --> 01:07:56,044
My work in court is not done.
That's why l came.

1364
01:07:56,117 --> 01:07:58,312
So, you stay here.
We're going. - Let's go.

1365
01:07:58,419 --> 01:08:01,217
That's why l've come. What
will l do here? l'll go with you.

1366
01:08:01,322 --> 01:08:02,653
l'll come again tomorrow.

1367
01:08:03,057 --> 01:08:04,718
Why are you looking at me?
He's not my brother-in-law.

1368
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:05,952
Let him sit inside.

1369
01:08:06,561 --> 01:08:07,858
l'll sit behind. - Not behind!

1370
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:09,158
Why will you sit behind?

1371
01:08:09,264 --> 01:08:10,253
l sat behind while coming.

1372
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:12,697
You'll never progress in life.
Sit in the front! - Come on!

1373
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,769
A brother-in-law always
has to sit behind. - Come on!

1374
01:08:16,004 --> 01:08:19,235
But you are respecting me and
making me sit in the front. Fine.

1375
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:31,248
All right, friends. So, you can
go to the bathroom if you want to.

1376
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:35,651
Yes. - Look around
and go to the bathroom.

1377
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,389
How did you come to know that
they want to go to the bathroom?

1378
01:08:37,692 --> 01:08:38,716
As they say,

1379
01:08:38,893 --> 01:08:42,989
Something goes into my
eye and my friend's eye pains.

1380
01:08:43,364 --> 01:08:46,561
lf l don't realize that my friends
want to go to the bathroom..

1381
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:48,636
..then shame on my friendship.

1382
01:08:48,836 --> 01:08:50,303
Friends know what's going
on in each other's hearts..

1383
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:51,895
..but l know what's going
on in their kidneys too.

1384
01:08:52,774 --> 01:08:54,674
Brother, let's go to the bathroom.

1385
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:56,038
But l don't want to.

1386
01:08:56,444 --> 01:08:58,605
lf you put some pressure,
you will feel like.

1387
01:08:59,147 --> 01:09:00,739
Brother, you can come
to give me company at least.

1388
01:09:00,848 --> 01:09:02,338
l will give you
company in a war too.

1389
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,142
We have met now,
wonder when we will meet again.

1390
01:09:04,786 --> 01:09:06,515
Come on, brother.
Please. - All right.

1391
01:09:06,688 --> 01:09:08,451
Brother Bunty.
Brother Bunty. Over here.

1392
01:09:08,556 --> 01:09:10,854
Brother Bunty, we'll go this way.
- But they went over there?

1393
01:09:10,925 --> 01:09:13,359
Your brother-in-law
has also gone there.

1394
01:09:13,661 --> 01:09:16,391
You see, you shouldn't urinate
besides your brother-in-law.

1395
01:09:16,664 --> 01:09:17,596
lt doesn't look good.

1396
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:18,688
We'll go this way.

1397
01:09:18,866 --> 01:09:20,629
You go ahead. Will you
make sounds and make me do.

1398
01:09:20,735 --> 01:09:22,760
Please give me company,
brother. Come. - ls it?

1399
01:09:31,879 --> 01:09:34,643
They say after death a person
become light. She is so heavy.

1400
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:39,208
Let's go.

1401
01:09:41,022 --> 01:09:42,080
What have you done?

1402
01:09:42,256 --> 01:09:43,689
You said, let's go.
So l threw her.

1403
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:45,190
l meant let's go over there.

1404
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,920
We'll conduct the last
rites of the corpse over there.

1405
01:09:47,996 --> 01:09:49,861
Was she our sister that
we should conduct her last rites?

1406
01:09:49,998 --> 01:09:52,159
l've never taken up the responsibility
of my real sister so seriously..

1407
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,360
..the way l'm fulfilling
her responsibility.

1408
01:09:53,501 --> 01:09:54,661
Consider the dead girl your sister.

1409
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:56,431
Yes. You were embracing
her when she was alive..

1410
01:09:56,537 --> 01:09:57,902
..and when she's dead,
you call her your sister.

1411
01:09:58,072 --> 01:09:59,596
Tell me what is to
be done with her now.

1412
01:09:59,707 --> 01:10:02,141
You threw her and now you
ask what is to be done with her?

1413
01:10:02,343 --> 01:10:03,810
What if someone sees the corpse?

1414
01:10:03,878 --> 01:10:05,505
lt's going to rain.
The pond is going to be filled.

1415
01:10:05,613 --> 01:10:06,978
She'll be flown away.
No one will see her.

1416
01:10:07,048 --> 01:10:08,879
What if someone sees her right now?

1417
01:10:08,983 --> 01:10:10,348
She could have
committed suicide too.

1418
01:10:10,418 --> 01:10:12,818
Who wraps herself in
a cloth and commits suicide?

1419
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,410
She's a girl! She can do anything!

1420
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:16,650
First you killed a woman.
At least now act wise.

1421
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:18,658
l didn't kill her!
- l haven't killed her either!

1422
01:10:18,726 --> 01:10:20,887
Then has she been martyred
in the Kargil war?

1423
01:10:21,295 --> 01:10:24,230
Brother, are you watering the fields?
Don't you think it's taking too long?

1424
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,599
Brother, actually,
l have a stone in my kidney.

1425
01:10:27,702 --> 01:10:29,932
So, the process is slow.

1426
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,507
Jassi, drive fast.

1427
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:39,707
Did you leave anything?

1428
01:10:39,914 --> 01:10:42,348
Strange. Are they kids that
they would leave it incomplete?

1429
01:10:42,483 --> 01:10:43,541
What kind of questions do you ask?

1430
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:46,914
Stop at a nice place.
We'll go to the bathroom.

1431
01:10:53,428 --> 01:10:54,690
Here comes one.

1432
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,419
Stop it.

1433
01:10:57,231 --> 01:10:58,220
Stop! Stop!

1434
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:00,732
Come out.
Where are you coming from?

1435
01:11:01,269 --> 01:11:05,069
We.. had gone to pay homage.

1436
01:11:05,173 --> 01:11:06,834
But the temple is this way.

1437
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:09,000
lt is this way.

1438
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,476
But we had gone for our
personal work.. My grandfather..

1439
01:11:11,612 --> 01:11:13,773
My grandpa. - l see.
- We had gone to pay homage to him.

1440
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:16,010
Whose car is this? - Range Rover.

1441
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:17,549
Who's the owner?

1442
01:11:18,386 --> 01:11:19,819
lt's his. - lt's mine.

1443
01:11:20,955 --> 01:11:22,479
What's the matter?
Why do you all look so pale?

1444
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:23,987
Because it's sunny.

1445
01:11:24,058 --> 01:11:25,753
lt's the monsoon.
- We haven't slept well.

1446
01:11:25,827 --> 01:11:27,317
We are not well.

1447
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:28,753
l will make you well.

1448
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:30,157
Check their car. Open the car.

1449
01:11:30,264 --> 01:11:32,425
There's nothing in the car.
We threw whatever was in the trunk.

1450
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:33,932
What did you throw? - Shefi.

1451
01:11:34,469 --> 01:11:35,458
Shefi?

1452
01:11:36,504 --> 01:11:38,404
Spare wheel. Spare wheel.

1453
01:11:38,539 --> 01:11:40,166
Spare wheel.
Spare wheel. - Stepney?

1454
01:11:40,274 --> 01:11:41,298
Stepney. Yes.

1455
01:11:41,442 --> 01:11:43,342
Okay, forget all that.
Tell me, what do you do?

1456
01:11:45,012 --> 01:11:47,071
l have an ad agency.

1457
01:11:47,248 --> 01:11:49,648
Come here! Where are you going?

1458
01:11:49,817 --> 01:11:51,614
Do something for me.

1459
01:11:51,919 --> 01:11:55,616
l have a sister-in-law who
loves to act. Do something for her.

1460
01:11:55,923 --> 01:11:57,618
Keep my visiting card. Take this.

1461
01:11:57,692 --> 01:11:58,716
You can contact me
whenever you feel like.

1462
01:11:58,793 --> 01:12:00,226
l'll call you.

1463
01:12:00,394 --> 01:12:04,262
Bye. - Let them go. Take the car.

1464
01:12:05,032 --> 01:12:06,863
My visiting card saved us today.

1465
01:12:07,034 --> 01:12:08,968
The previous ideas were yours too.

1466
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:15,631
'l've made a new office.
This contains all my new numbers.'

1467
01:12:18,713 --> 01:12:19,839
What happened now?

1468
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:23,349
l had given my card
to Shefi as well.

1469
01:12:54,348 --> 01:12:55,940
Where did the corpse go?

1470
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:04,685
l think we should conduct
the girl's last rites.

1471
01:13:04,992 --> 01:13:06,687
No one will suspect us then.

1472
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:08,251
You didn't even put up a photo
of your dear ones who are dead..

1473
01:13:08,396 --> 01:13:09,624
..and you want to conduct
last rites for strangers.

1474
01:13:09,697 --> 01:13:10,857
The police will
directly suspect us.

1475
01:13:10,998 --> 01:13:12,192
We'll have to be very careful.

1476
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:13,698
We could get a call
any minute for inquiry.

1477
01:13:13,901 --> 01:13:16,028
l'm going to change
the mode of my phone.

1478
01:13:16,103 --> 01:13:17,263
lt's the vibration mode.

1479
01:13:17,405 --> 01:13:18,963
l'm on vibration mode myself.

1480
01:13:19,273 --> 01:13:21,207
Since the murder has taken place,
l'm shivering.

1481
01:13:21,275 --> 01:13:23,402
l'm going to throw my phone away.

1482
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:25,806
My condition is worst than yours.

1483
01:13:26,047 --> 01:13:28,072
My visiting card will be
found during the post-mortem.

1484
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:30,174
You idiot! The post-mortem
is done to the body.

1485
01:13:30,284 --> 01:13:31,683
The card was in her pocket.

1486
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,645
Dimpy, you're useless anyway.

1487
01:13:35,823 --> 01:13:37,222
Accept the death penalty
for the sake of your friends.

1488
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:39,282
We will donate fans in
the hospital in your name.

1489
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,052
After death also you
will keep turning around.

1490
01:13:41,229 --> 01:13:44,289
lf birds don't die dashing
against you then change my name.

1491
01:13:44,732 --> 01:13:46,324
For God's sakes, please agree.

1492
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,836
My son already gets attacks. Now
l'm getting attacks too. Please.

1493
01:13:49,971 --> 01:13:51,996
Have l killed her?
lt was his idea to take him.

1494
01:13:52,173 --> 01:13:53,037
Why did you lie to me and take me?

1495
01:13:53,107 --> 01:13:54,631
Please don't talk in between,
brother.

1496
01:13:54,876 --> 01:13:57,106
l had taken him there
to change his fate.

1497
01:13:57,178 --> 01:13:59,146
l didn't know that
our fates would change too.

1498
01:13:59,313 --> 01:14:00,541
l didn't kill her.

1499
01:14:00,715 --> 01:14:02,239
Please don't talk in between,
brother.

1500
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:04,284
lf you leave a girl
alone with a boy..

1501
01:14:04,385 --> 01:14:05,579
..then something like
this was bound to happen.

1502
01:14:05,686 --> 01:14:07,677
l said l didn't kill her. - Please
don't talk in between, brother.

1503
01:14:07,755 --> 01:14:08,881
Did l tell her to kill the girl?

1504
01:14:08,956 --> 01:14:10,947
ldiots,
l said l have not killed her.

1505
01:14:11,058 --> 01:14:12,218
Please don't talk in between,
brother.

1506
01:14:12,326 --> 01:14:13,122
Talk.

1507
01:14:13,194 --> 01:14:15,788
You'll call me brother
and get me hanged.

1508
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,488
At least listen to
me who has called you.

1509
01:14:17,665 --> 01:14:18,654
Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!

1510
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,989
Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!

1511
01:14:20,101 --> 01:14:23,093
Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!
- l'll slap you! Listen to me!

1512
01:14:23,571 --> 01:14:25,562
lf the police call
anyone of us and tell us..

1513
01:14:25,806 --> 01:14:27,433
..that Jassi's
card was found with..

1514
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:29,141
..the corpse,
then everyone will say..

1515
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:30,871
.. that we met Shefi in Ludhiana,
in a hotel.

1516
01:14:31,045 --> 01:14:33,309
That too by chance.
She didn't meet us again.

1517
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:35,744
We Just found her corpse.
- Yes. - Yes.

1518
01:14:41,222 --> 01:14:43,952
Now l came to know why you didn't
let me call the police the other day.

1519
01:14:44,325 --> 01:14:46,054
He was Seerat's fiancAc.

1520
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,091
While shifting the
things the other day..

1521
01:14:48,162 --> 01:14:49,925
..couldn't you take the engagement
album as well? - Hello.

1522
01:14:50,131 --> 01:14:51,120
Talk to me.

1523
01:14:51,299 --> 01:14:52,823
lf you had called
us to the engagement..

1524
01:14:52,967 --> 01:14:54,992
..then we would have
exposed him that night itself.

1525
01:14:55,102 --> 01:14:58,162
Look, l'm really sorry that we
didn't call you for the engagement.

1526
01:14:58,239 --> 01:14:59,263
To hell with the engagement!

1527
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,932
First tell me about
the album that is caught!

1528
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:03,067
Sister-in-law was caught before the
album. You're not talking about her.

1529
01:15:03,144 --> 01:15:04,042
Oh, God!

1530
01:15:04,111 --> 01:15:06,807
Look, brother,
don't put him on medication too.

1531
01:15:07,682 --> 01:15:10,116
lf there's someone wise from you
all, then please bring him here.

1532
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:13,278
Brother, l apologize
to you for whatever happened.

1533
01:15:13,988 --> 01:15:16,616
Look, Seerat, l haven't
come here to prove anyone wrong.

1534
01:15:16,857 --> 01:15:19,087
That night, that boy had
come to meet you and not my wife.

1535
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,594
lf you knew this,
then why did you make a noise..

1536
01:15:21,662 --> 01:15:23,323
..that sister-in-law
was caught wet-handed?

1537
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:24,720
Red-handed.

1538
01:15:26,867 --> 01:15:28,459
Move! Crazy family.

1539
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:31,568
Seerat, the room downstairs
used to be yours.

1540
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:34,098
Lucky had come to
meet you that night.

1541
01:15:34,775 --> 01:15:36,436
l feel he's not wrong.

1542
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:39,475
Really? He comes to meet your
sister at night before marriage.

1543
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:40,638
Why is he not wrong?

1544
01:15:40,715 --> 01:15:43,707
lt was his birthday.
You didn't let him meet her.

1545
01:15:44,051 --> 01:15:46,519
Forget it.
You won't understand this.

1546
01:15:46,854 --> 01:15:48,981
Only you can understand it.

1547
01:15:52,893 --> 01:15:54,019
Chotu. - Yes, sir.

1548
01:15:54,328 --> 01:15:55,727
Make some tea.
- There's no milk, sir.

1549
01:15:55,963 --> 01:15:57,658
Go and get it from the
market quickly. - Yes, sir.

1550
01:17:23,751 --> 01:17:25,048
l hate you, Lucky.

1551
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:29,015
Seerat. Seerat. Seerat. Seerat.

1552
01:17:29,523 --> 01:17:31,991
Seerat. - How many
times will l forgive you?

1553
01:17:32,226 --> 01:17:33,318
But what have l done this time?

1554
01:17:33,394 --> 01:17:34,986
You call this nothing?

1555
01:17:35,329 --> 01:17:37,058
What are you saying?
l Just don't understand.

1556
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:38,530
But l understand everything.

1557
01:17:39,266 --> 01:17:41,166
Tell me,
how did you entice this girl?

1558
01:17:41,335 --> 01:17:42,324
Which girl?

1559
01:17:42,536 --> 01:17:46,063
Oh. Which girl? The girl
with whom you were on the sofa..

1560
01:17:47,675 --> 01:17:49,666
lt's not a girl.
lt's a.. She's gone.

1561
01:17:49,844 --> 01:17:51,641
l mean, he's gone.
Seerat, it was a man.

1562
01:17:52,146 --> 01:17:54,205
Really? lt was a man?

1563
01:17:54,648 --> 01:17:57,242
So, tell me. Does this
ladies sandal belong to a man?

1564
01:17:57,351 --> 01:17:59,478
This Jeans.. Does this
ladies Jean belong to a man?

1565
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:01,020
Does this ladies
top belong to a man?

1566
01:18:01,122 --> 01:18:02,111
Try to understand.

1567
01:18:02,189 --> 01:18:03,486
Seerat, you're misunderstanding.

1568
01:18:03,858 --> 01:18:05,587
lt's l who's
misunderstanding, Lucky?

1569
01:18:07,995 --> 01:18:09,929
l had come to forgive you.

1570
01:18:17,037 --> 01:18:20,973
l'm sorry. l won't come back now.

1571
01:18:21,442 --> 01:18:24,969
Seerat. Seerat. Seerat.

1572
01:18:33,354 --> 01:18:39,418
How do l prove my love to you?

1573
01:18:39,994 --> 01:18:46,194
How do l show you
how much l love you?

1574
01:18:47,568 --> 01:18:50,366
The bud of love.

1575
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:53,835
Should not die.

1576
01:18:54,375 --> 01:19:00,473
Don't leave me, girl.
My heart will break.

1577
01:19:01,615 --> 01:19:07,144
Don't leave me, girl.
My heart will break.

1578
01:19:07,288 --> 01:19:10,689
My heart will break.

1579
01:19:10,858 --> 01:19:13,224
My heart will break.

1580
01:19:13,561 --> 01:19:16,997
Your love is crazy.

1581
01:19:17,131 --> 01:19:19,463
lt might ruin you.

1582
01:19:19,867 --> 01:19:20,856
lt might ruin you.

1583
01:19:20,935 --> 01:19:22,698
l can't feel my soul.

1584
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,237
lf you don't take a look.

1585
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:26,462
Love says it all.

1586
01:19:27,975 --> 01:19:31,570
l can't take my life
with you by my side.

1587
01:19:31,645 --> 01:19:33,772
l can't stay alone.

1588
01:19:38,385 --> 01:19:45,086
l fell in love when l saw you.

1589
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:52,193
l feel peaceful
when you walk with me.

1590
01:19:52,499 --> 01:19:58,995
l fell in love when l saw you.

1591
01:19:59,673 --> 01:20:06,044
l feel peaceful
when you walk with me.

1592
01:20:07,248 --> 01:20:13,778
Hold my hand tightly
so that we're never separated.

1593
01:20:14,355 --> 01:20:19,122
Don't leave me, girl.
My heart will break.

1594
01:20:19,226 --> 01:20:20,887
My heart will break.

1595
01:20:21,428 --> 01:20:26,593
Don't leave me, girl.
My heart will break.

1596
01:20:27,034 --> 01:20:30,367
My heart will break.

1597
01:20:30,638 --> 01:20:32,606
My heart will break.

1598
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:36,707
Your love is crazy.

1599
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:39,209
lt might ruin you.

1600
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:40,506
lt might ruin you.

1601
01:20:40,648 --> 01:20:42,445
l can't feel my soul.

1602
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:44,016
lf you don't take a look.

1603
01:20:44,285 --> 01:20:46,583
Love says it all.

1604
01:20:47,788 --> 01:20:51,053
l can't take my life
with you by my side.

1605
01:20:51,392 --> 01:20:53,952
l can't stay alone.

1606
01:20:58,032 --> 01:21:04,631
l'm scared, beloved.
Don't ever leave me.

1607
01:21:05,139 --> 01:21:11,442
Don't go away from my heart.

1608
01:21:12,313 --> 01:21:18,513
l'm scared, beloved.
Don't ever leave me.

1609
01:21:19,353 --> 01:21:25,588
Don't go away from my heart.

1610
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:33,195
l hope my love always
stays in your heart.

1611
01:21:34,101 --> 01:21:39,664
Don't leave me, girl.
My heart will break.

1612
01:21:39,773 --> 01:21:40,967
My heart will break.

1613
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:46,240
Don't leave me, girl.
My heart will break.

1614
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:49,879
My heart will break.

1615
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,377
My heart will break.

1616
01:21:52,953 --> 01:21:56,116
Your love is crazy.

1617
01:21:56,523 --> 01:21:59,014
lt might ruin you.

1618
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:11,960
Pen drive?

1619
01:22:15,943 --> 01:22:16,932
Oh, no.

1620
01:22:19,947 --> 01:22:21,209
Mr. Mukhtiar Singh?

1621
01:22:31,024 --> 01:22:33,549
l've heard that Lucky's
Seerat has created problems again.

1622
01:22:33,761 --> 01:22:35,228
What else would she do?

1623
01:22:35,329 --> 01:22:36,296
By the way, what has she done?

1624
01:22:36,363 --> 01:22:37,455
Dimpy was telling me..

1625
01:22:37,564 --> 01:22:39,828
..that a thief with long
hair had come to Lucky's house.

1626
01:22:40,234 --> 01:22:43,328
Lucky caught the thief
and Seerat thought it was a girl.

1627
01:22:43,537 --> 01:22:44,834
That's it.

1628
01:22:44,905 --> 01:22:46,805
Look at this.
Till today, l had heard that..

1629
01:22:46,874 --> 01:22:49,342
..it's difficult to distinguish
between two men these days.

1630
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,371
For the first time,
l'm hearing that it has become..

1631
01:22:51,478 --> 01:22:52,570
..difficult to distinguish
between a man and a woman too.

1632
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,269
Thank you.

1633
01:22:54,548 --> 01:22:56,448
lt's for the eyes. - Sorry.

1634
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:58,715
He loves her so much.

1635
01:22:58,886 --> 01:23:02,322
But she doesn't understand
his feelings. She's a witch.

1636
01:23:02,823 --> 01:23:03,812
Sister-in-law.

1637
01:23:03,991 --> 01:23:06,357
l didn't recognize you.
- l'm Seerat.

1638
01:23:08,762 --> 01:23:11,253
Sorry. l didn't see you,
so l called you a witch.

1639
01:23:11,365 --> 01:23:13,390
But you made me realize,
sister-in-law.

1640
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,158
Ma'am, please don't open your eyes.

1641
01:23:15,736 --> 01:23:19,137
l think l've made a big mistake.
What do l do now?

1642
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,998
Don't worry. We'll take care of
everything. Right, sister-in-law?

1643
01:23:23,143 --> 01:23:26,874
Absolutely. lt's my son's birthday
party this evening at Kasba Resort.

1644
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:29,081
Lucky will be there.
You come there too.

1645
01:23:29,249 --> 01:23:31,479
We'll clear your misunderstandings.
- Of course.

1646
01:23:33,187 --> 01:23:36,020
Just think. The poor Shefi
died for such a small thing.

1647
01:23:36,089 --> 01:23:37,579
lt wasn't any ordinary pen drive.

1648
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:39,589
There were pictures of the minister
Mukhtiar Singh with a girl..

1649
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,184
..and that too vulgar pictures.

1650
01:23:41,361 --> 01:23:42,988
l think she was blackmailing him.

1651
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:44,394
But where is that pen drive?

1652
01:23:44,798 --> 01:23:47,767
Seerat had given me a TaJ Mahal.
l've hidden it inside that.

1653
01:23:47,968 --> 01:23:50,937
Okay. But at least it's clear
now that he didn't murder her.

1654
01:23:51,538 --> 01:23:53,165
You thought l was the murderer?

1655
01:23:53,373 --> 01:23:54,704
You're talking about thinking?

1656
01:23:54,842 --> 01:23:56,332
These two have
already booked a van..

1657
01:23:56,443 --> 01:23:58,343
..to take your corpse
after you are hanged.

1658
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,075
Lucky, don't go anywhere now.

1659
01:24:02,416 --> 01:24:04,077
We've called Seerat here today.

1660
01:24:04,151 --> 01:24:06,381
We'll set everything
right between you two today.

1661
01:24:06,453 --> 01:24:08,353
Seerat is coming? - Yes.

1662
01:24:08,689 --> 01:24:12,216
lf your sisters-in-law can't help you
settle down, then we're useless.

1663
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:13,348
Listen to them.

1664
01:24:13,427 --> 01:24:14,416
Sister, this is Chintu.

1665
01:24:14,628 --> 01:24:15,856
lf Chaku gets an attack..

1666
01:24:15,929 --> 01:24:17,988
..while cutting the cake,
then make him cut the cake.

1667
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:20,599
You always talk negative.
You never say good things.

1668
01:24:20,734 --> 01:24:22,861
He has to cut a cake,
not a mountain. Get lost.

1669
01:24:23,036 --> 01:24:27,473
When he was born, did your give
me something sour instead of sweet?

1670
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:31,742
Sorry, brother. l apologize
to you on behalf of him.

1671
01:24:32,412 --> 01:24:34,642
Jassi. Come with me for a minute.

1672
01:24:38,385 --> 01:24:40,910
l think they are planning
a scheme to fix you.

1673
01:24:43,557 --> 01:24:45,149
l think something is wrong.

1674
01:24:45,492 --> 01:24:48,393
What Happened? - We told Bunty that shefi was my fiancee

1675
01:24:48,562 --> 01:24:49,961
But our sisters-in-law
have called Seerat.

1676
01:24:50,063 --> 01:24:51,587
The sisters-in-law..
- What about the sisters-in-law?

1677
01:24:51,765 --> 01:24:54,928
Before Seerat comes here,
take Bunty along and go away.

1678
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:56,260
Within a minute.

1679
01:24:56,503 --> 01:24:59,301
Yes, within a minute. 60, 59, 58..

1680
01:24:59,973 --> 01:25:01,463
A plan has been made to murder you.
Leave immediately.

1681
01:25:01,542 --> 01:25:02,702
What have l done?

1682
01:25:02,976 --> 01:25:05,240
Don't argue. l'm going to
get the car from the parking lot.

1683
01:25:05,312 --> 01:25:06,779
Meet me outside. Hurry up.

1684
01:25:07,281 --> 01:25:09,579
A woman is indeed a woman.

1685
01:25:10,183 --> 01:25:12,674
You intended to ruin my life,
but my sisters-in-law..

1686
01:25:13,086 --> 01:25:14,075
See it yourself.

1687
01:25:14,521 --> 01:25:15,385
l'm seeing everything.

1688
01:25:15,489 --> 01:25:17,013
They can't take care
of their own relationships..

1689
01:25:17,257 --> 01:25:18,519
..and they're trying
to be matchmakers for others.

1690
01:25:18,692 --> 01:25:22,150
lt's true. The buttons that my
wife stitches on my shirt fall off.

1691
01:25:22,296 --> 01:25:23,786
How will the relationship
stay that she forms?

1692
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:26,631
Brother, l wanted to talk to you.

1693
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,361
Look, brother, the punishment
for murder is severe.

1694
01:25:29,536 --> 01:25:30,867
Don't do anything foolish.

1695
01:25:30,938 --> 01:25:32,303
Who told you? - Brother-in-law did.

1696
01:25:32,372 --> 01:25:33,361
Brother-in-law.

1697
01:25:33,473 --> 01:25:34,633
Do more of this nonsense.

1698
01:25:34,775 --> 01:25:36,936
His brother-in-law
will get us in trouble.

1699
01:25:40,013 --> 01:25:41,002
My brother-in-law is here.

1700
01:25:41,114 --> 01:25:42,547
He's my brother-in-law.
- What happened to you?

1701
01:25:44,718 --> 01:25:46,549
Brother-in-law, don't worry.
l've explained to them.

1702
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,019
They won't do anything now.

1703
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:51,824
Will you tell us
orJust keep screaming?

1704
01:25:52,693 --> 01:25:53,682
She's here.

1705
01:25:55,796 --> 01:25:57,195
Unlucky story.

1706
01:25:59,166 --> 01:26:00,531
Unlucky story.

1707
01:26:02,569 --> 01:26:03,934
Unlucky story.

1708
01:26:21,888 --> 01:26:22,877
Sister-in-law.

1709
01:26:24,825 --> 01:26:25,792
Hello, sister-in-law.

1710
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:28,259
Come, let me introduce
you to my sister. Come. Come.

1711
01:26:29,596 --> 01:26:32,463
Sister, this is
the new sister-in-law.

1712
01:26:32,532 --> 01:26:33,521
What do you mean?

1713
01:26:33,634 --> 01:26:34,931
Lucky's fiancee.

1714
01:26:35,268 --> 01:26:36,963
Hello. - Hello.

1715
01:26:37,104 --> 01:26:38,765
Your face is Just like your body..

1716
01:26:38,872 --> 01:26:40,339
..that we saw in the beauty parlor.

1717
01:26:40,941 --> 01:26:44,069
We were waiting for you. Come, let
us take you to Lucky. Come. Come.

1718
01:26:44,244 --> 01:26:45,438
Come quickly. - l will come.

1719
01:26:47,214 --> 01:26:49,273
Here you go, Lucky. Now
clear all your misunderstandings.

1720
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:51,106
Don't let her go this time.

1721
01:26:52,052 --> 01:26:52,677
Come on, let's go.

1722
01:26:52,753 --> 01:26:54,015
You're alive?

1723
01:26:55,689 --> 01:26:58,522
The sisters-in-law have
put up the tent very well.

1724
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:00,884
Brother, the sisters-in-law
won't put up the tent.

1725
01:27:01,395 --> 01:27:03,056
He told me that the sisters-in-law
put up the tent very well.

1726
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:04,358
l was talking about their scent.

1727
01:27:04,464 --> 01:27:05,590
Brother,
please don't say anything today.

1728
01:27:05,799 --> 01:27:07,767
lf l don't have to say anything,
then why did you bring me here?

1729
01:27:07,868 --> 01:27:10,234
So that when the sisters-in-law
explain to Lucky, you say something.

1730
01:27:10,337 --> 01:27:11,599
You Just told me not to talk.

1731
01:27:11,838 --> 01:27:13,499
Don't talk now. Talk later.

1732
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:15,864
Give me my medicines.

1733
01:27:15,942 --> 01:27:17,409
Look, don't drive him crazy.

1734
01:27:17,577 --> 01:27:19,511
Brother, you sit. l'll get water.

1735
01:27:20,147 --> 01:27:22,172
lf you weren't wrapped in the sheet
the other day, then who was it?

1736
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:26,443
lt was my friend, Sonia. She was
Just high on drugs. But you killed her.

1737
01:27:28,321 --> 01:27:30,221
l didn't kill her.
Why are you staring at me?

1738
01:27:30,657 --> 01:27:32,352
l didn't kill her!
l didn't kill her!

1739
01:27:32,426 --> 01:27:33,415
Make a drink for me.

1740
01:27:34,795 --> 01:27:37,593
Brother, invited? - Comma.

1741
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:39,165
l'm not talking
about inverted comma.

1742
01:27:39,232 --> 01:27:41,723
l'm asking you if you've been invited
or have you Just gate crashed?

1743
01:27:42,002 --> 01:27:43,663
lt's been very long
since l used to gatecrash.

1744
01:27:43,737 --> 01:27:44,965
l see. You would do it before.

1745
01:27:45,038 --> 01:27:47,404
l mean, Lucky's sisters-in-law
have invited me.

1746
01:27:48,108 --> 01:27:49,473
By the way, brother, who are you?

1747
01:27:49,776 --> 01:27:51,107
Lucky's brother-in-law.

1748
01:27:51,912 --> 01:27:54,642
The way you are saying
as if you are proud of it.

1749
01:27:56,483 --> 01:27:57,882
Brother,
l'll go and look for Lucky.

1750
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,888
Take this, brother. Water.

1751
01:28:01,955 --> 01:28:05,686
Just give me my bag or l'll
make a noise that you murdered her.

1752
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:08,388
Why do you want the bag? There's
no pen drive in the bag. You Just..

1753
01:28:10,864 --> 01:28:11,853
Seerat.

1754
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,089
We are doomed.

1755
01:28:15,435 --> 01:28:16,424
Who was she?

1756
01:28:16,636 --> 01:28:18,604
She was.. Dimpy's sister-in-law.

1757
01:28:19,106 --> 01:28:21,040
You said Dimpy's wife
was the only daughter?

1758
01:28:21,174 --> 01:28:25,702
No, no. His father-in-law
had two marriages. You don't know.

1759
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,141
She was his second wife's daughter.

1760
01:28:28,415 --> 01:28:29,404
Why two marriage?

1761
01:28:29,716 --> 01:28:31,513
He didn't get much
dowry from the first one.

1762
01:28:31,618 --> 01:28:33,142
That's why he got married again.
- That's it.

1763
01:28:33,253 --> 01:28:36,017
Strange. Okay, where are the
sisters-in-law? l want to meet them.

1764
01:28:36,656 --> 01:28:38,487
Meet them? Why? - What do you mean?

1765
01:28:39,092 --> 01:28:43,495
l mean, we've met after so long.
Let's talk to each other first.

1766
01:28:44,698 --> 01:28:45,687
Come.

1767
01:28:46,366 --> 01:28:47,731
Why did you make
her my sister-in-law?

1768
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:49,131
Be thankful that we
didn't make her your sister.

1769
01:28:49,202 --> 01:28:50,863
Why are you making
your sister my sister?

1770
01:28:50,937 --> 01:28:52,962
Should we make her your mother?
- Why are you standing here?

1771
01:28:53,106 --> 01:28:54,573
Where has Lucky gone?

1772
01:28:56,576 --> 01:29:00,307
Lucky.. - Lucky's friend is here.
His Facebook friend.

1773
01:29:00,514 --> 01:29:02,141
You know,
the internet is not working.

1774
01:29:02,215 --> 01:29:03,739
So they met face to face. - Yes.

1775
01:29:04,251 --> 01:29:05,650
Dimpy, you must be hungry. - Yes.

1776
01:29:05,786 --> 01:29:06,775
Shouldn't we eat something?

1777
01:29:06,887 --> 01:29:08,218
Yes. Let's go. Come.

1778
01:29:10,323 --> 01:29:12,223
Lucky, l'm really very sorry.

1779
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,850
lf l hadn't met
your sisters-in-law..

1780
01:29:14,928 --> 01:29:16,623
..l would have never
known the truth.

1781
01:29:20,167 --> 01:29:21,156
lt's okay.

1782
01:29:22,235 --> 01:29:23,224
Hi.

1783
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:24,959
Hi.

1784
01:29:25,172 --> 01:29:26,833
Can l get you a drink? - No.

1785
01:29:27,174 --> 01:29:28,471
Excuse me.

1786
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:31,840
Sister-in-law, can l get
you something to eat? - No, thanks.

1787
01:29:35,348 --> 01:29:37,748
Sister-in-law. You're really wise.

1788
01:29:37,951 --> 01:29:39,816
l'll have to call
her sister-in-law now.

1789
01:29:40,187 --> 01:29:41,415
Good. Good.

1790
01:29:42,622 --> 01:29:44,954
By the way, how was her figure?
- Figure?

1791
01:29:45,425 --> 01:29:47,086
'Lucky's brother-in-law.'

1792
01:29:47,961 --> 01:29:49,553
You're so frank. - Why?

1793
01:29:49,663 --> 01:29:52,632
Do you flirt with your sister too?
- You scoundrel!

1794
01:29:53,633 --> 01:29:55,260
Sit. Sit. Can we sit here, mister?

1795
01:29:56,169 --> 01:29:59,900
Yes. - Lucky very well knew
that we've called Seerat here.

1796
01:30:00,273 --> 01:30:01,706
Still he's standing with
some other girl in a corner.

1797
01:30:02,409 --> 01:30:05,970
Just see. We wanted to sort things
out for such a characterless man.

1798
01:30:06,446 --> 01:30:07,674
Seerat is absolutely right.

1799
01:30:08,014 --> 01:30:09,174
The times are bad.

1800
01:30:09,716 --> 01:30:11,775
l don't know.
Look, we belong to these times too.

1801
01:30:12,018 --> 01:30:13,542
We never did something like that.

1802
01:30:13,653 --> 01:30:15,780
lf l slap you, you'll go deaf.

1803
01:30:15,922 --> 01:30:17,753
Get lost. l've seen many like you.

1804
01:30:17,824 --> 01:30:20,054
Brother, you must have
not seen anyone like me.

1805
01:30:20,293 --> 01:30:21,521
Will you tell me who l've seen?

1806
01:30:21,595 --> 01:30:23,859
But you can't ignore
what the wise say.

1807
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:25,019
Seerat. - Lucky, l..

1808
01:30:25,632 --> 01:30:28,192
Hello. - Can l talk
to her for a second?

1809
01:30:28,602 --> 01:30:29,591
Yes.

1810
01:30:32,372 --> 01:30:35,830
Seerat, your Lucky is standing in the
corner with other girls even over here.

1811
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:37,599
l didn't understand.

1812
01:30:37,911 --> 01:30:39,378
Even l don't understand
what that means.

1813
01:30:39,446 --> 01:30:42,142
lt means corner.
But l didn't understand..

1814
01:30:44,517 --> 01:30:45,950
Wonder what happened?

1815
01:30:46,286 --> 01:30:47,514
What happened? ls there a problem?

1816
01:30:48,288 --> 01:30:49,516
l think l'm in trouble.

1817
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,350
You're not in trouble yet.

1818
01:30:51,424 --> 01:30:52,914
But if you don't
give me the pen drive..

1819
01:30:53,026 --> 01:30:54,186
..then you'll surely be in trouble.

1820
01:30:56,463 --> 01:30:57,794
Sister-in-law, what did you see?

1821
01:30:57,864 --> 01:31:00,025
What do you mean?
We saw what you showed us.

1822
01:31:00,567 --> 01:31:01,192
l didn't understand.

1823
01:31:01,268 --> 01:31:03,964
lf you were sensible, then you
wouldn't break someone's relationship.

1824
01:31:04,104 --> 01:31:05,901
What do you mean? - Get lost.

1825
01:31:06,273 --> 01:31:07,467
Tell me something.
Should l go or get lost?

1826
01:31:07,574 --> 01:31:09,565
l can either go or get lost.
Touch me if you can.

1827
01:31:09,676 --> 01:31:10,540
Here you go.

1828
01:31:10,644 --> 01:31:12,236
You elbowed me.
You have hands, right?

1829
01:31:12,312 --> 01:31:13,609
Touch me if you can. - You'll die.

1830
01:31:13,747 --> 01:31:14,441
You will die.

1831
01:31:14,514 --> 01:31:16,175
Touch me if you can.
- You touch me.

1832
01:31:16,316 --> 01:31:17,476
What are you doing?

1833
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:19,211
Your brother-in-law is
touching someone else over there.

1834
01:31:19,352 --> 01:31:20,944
Brother,
he's disrespecting our sister.

1835
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:24,254
Now tell me.
My elder brother is here now.

1836
01:31:24,324 --> 01:31:25,256
What can l say?

1837
01:31:25,325 --> 01:31:27,190
You haven't even left your elder
brother worthy of saying anything.

1838
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,021
He was asking about
his sister's figure.

1839
01:31:29,596 --> 01:31:30,585
Let's go.

1840
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,799
Brother, why are you scolding me?
He was saying it. l didn't say it.

1841
01:31:33,934 --> 01:31:36,698
Let him say it. She's not his sister.
You shouldn't say it. Let's go.

1842
01:31:36,903 --> 01:31:38,837
Never mind. l'll teach
you a lesson later. - Come.

1843
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:40,736
ls this why you called
me to the party?

1844
01:31:40,941 --> 01:31:42,602
Who called you?
- You witches called me.

1845
01:31:42,709 --> 01:31:43,698
l'll slap you.

1846
01:31:43,944 --> 01:31:45,275
l'll call Lucky right away.

1847
01:31:45,378 --> 01:31:47,573
Why are you going to call him?
Just take him to some corner.

1848
01:31:47,847 --> 01:31:50,645
l'll take him wherever l want to.
Why do you care?

1849
01:31:50,817 --> 01:31:53,513
She's so arrogant. Wait here.

1850
01:31:54,988 --> 01:31:57,786
My fiancee is here.
Please wait until the cake is cut.

1851
01:31:57,891 --> 01:32:00,052
l'm getting late.
- Do you have to catch a bus?

1852
01:32:00,226 --> 01:32:02,888
Shut up. Does anyone
talk to a girl like that?

1853
01:32:03,129 --> 01:32:05,654
Look, there was a lot
of virus in your pen drive.

1854
01:32:05,765 --> 01:32:07,357
So, we're getting it scanned.

1855
01:32:07,467 --> 01:32:08,491
Only 10 minutes.

1856
01:32:08,702 --> 01:32:10,932
Your relationship will be
ruined in 10 minutes. Come with me.

1857
01:32:11,271 --> 01:32:12,602
Make this a fry pan too.

1858
01:32:12,772 --> 01:32:13,761
lt's not fry pan but a vessel.

1859
01:32:13,873 --> 01:32:14,965
Fry pan is also a vessel.

1860
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:16,975
You idiots keep fighting
among yourselves.

1861
01:32:17,177 --> 01:32:19,441
Jassi, come on.
There's a new trouble.

1862
01:32:20,146 --> 01:32:22,580
Now tell me, witch. - Sister-in-law,
mind your language.

1863
01:32:22,716 --> 01:32:25,184
Look at her. She can't
bear to see you with Lucky.

1864
01:32:25,251 --> 01:32:26,240
Why should l bear it?

1865
01:32:26,419 --> 01:32:28,080
Crazy. She has gone crazy.

1866
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:31,447
Lucky is marrying her.
Let them get married.

1867
01:32:31,925 --> 01:32:33,552
He's marrying her?

1868
01:32:33,927 --> 01:32:36,862
Let me see how Lucky marries her.

1869
01:32:49,943 --> 01:32:53,902
She emits poison.

1870
01:32:55,849 --> 01:32:59,751
She will drink milk today.

1871
01:33:01,721 --> 01:33:04,690
She emits poison.

1872
01:33:04,791 --> 01:33:07,692
She will drink milk today.

1873
01:33:07,827 --> 01:33:13,094
Don't go near her,
even by mistake.

1874
01:33:13,633 --> 01:33:19,037
She is like a snake.

1875
01:33:19,506 --> 01:33:24,910
She is like a snake.

1876
01:33:43,163 --> 01:33:46,621
Many people have left the place.

1877
01:33:46,699 --> 01:33:48,963
Left the place.

1878
01:33:49,102 --> 01:33:52,230
Many people have left the place.

1879
01:33:52,505 --> 01:33:54,939
Left the place.

1880
01:33:55,175 --> 01:33:57,973
Many people have left the place.

1881
01:33:58,078 --> 01:34:00,569
Many people have left the place.

1882
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:06,443
Many strong ones
are still sitting.

1883
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:12,087
She is like a snake.

1884
01:34:12,725 --> 01:34:17,992
She is like a snake.

1885
01:34:30,443 --> 01:34:33,844
Those who used to roam with guns.

1886
01:34:33,913 --> 01:34:36,108
Guns.

1887
01:34:36,349 --> 01:34:39,682
Those who roam
around with knives.

1888
01:34:39,853 --> 01:34:41,946
Knives.

1889
01:34:42,288 --> 01:34:45,223
Those who used to roam with guns.

1890
01:34:45,358 --> 01:34:48,156
Those who roam
around with knives.

1891
01:34:48,328 --> 01:34:53,493
They got nervous and left.

1892
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:59,300
She is like a snake.

1893
01:34:59,939 --> 01:35:06,469
She is like a snake.

1894
01:35:08,281 --> 01:35:10,442
lt's enough, Lucky.
Get me my pen drive.

1895
01:35:10,717 --> 01:35:13,948
lt's enough, Lucky. What the
sisters-in-law want will never happen.

1896
01:35:14,187 --> 01:35:16,451
Why are you interfering
between those two? Come with me.

1897
01:35:17,257 --> 01:35:19,919
Sister-in-law.. - Sister-in-law,
you're crossing your limit.

1898
01:35:20,393 --> 01:35:22,418
As if you're in your limit.

1899
01:35:23,029 --> 01:35:24,087
Tell me what the matter is, dear.

1900
01:35:24,164 --> 01:35:25,529
You make me beg so much.

1901
01:35:25,798 --> 01:35:27,459
That's why your wives are fed up.

1902
01:35:27,834 --> 01:35:30,394
Wait a minute.
Sister-in-law. - Are you crazy?

1903
01:35:31,137 --> 01:35:32,661
Come on. Let's go and
give her the pen drive.

1904
01:35:32,772 --> 01:35:34,171
lf l'm thrown out of the house,
then where will l live?

1905
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,970
l will keep you.
But how can we go? Seerat is angry.

1906
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:39,601
lf anything goes wrong,
l will be doomed.

1907
01:35:39,712 --> 01:35:41,577
lf she tells our wives,
then along with Chaku..

1908
01:35:41,714 --> 01:35:43,909
..his father too will
start getting attacks.

1909
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:45,108
Are you coming or not?

1910
01:35:45,852 --> 01:35:46,944
You're strange.

1911
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:49,980
lnstead of giving the kid a gift,
you're taking the kid's father along.

1912
01:35:50,056 --> 01:35:52,820
To hell with the gift.
ls she Chaku's aunt?

1913
01:35:53,159 --> 01:35:54,148
Brother-in-law.

1914
01:35:54,327 --> 01:35:55,419
He shouldn't see us.
Let's go. Let's go.

1915
01:35:55,595 --> 01:35:57,756
He is born at an inauspicious time.
Do something about him.

1916
01:35:57,964 --> 01:35:59,056
Where are they going?

1917
01:35:59,332 --> 01:36:02,733
Father, we're fed up explaining
to her, but she doesn't listen.

1918
01:36:02,835 --> 01:36:05,429
Your sister has come to
ruin my life and l don't listen?

1919
01:36:05,672 --> 01:36:08,470
Where did her sister come from?
l have only one daughter.

1920
01:36:08,575 --> 01:36:10,099
You don't have one daughter.
l know everything.

1921
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:12,501
You have two wives and
you're explaining to me?

1922
01:36:12,612 --> 01:36:16,241
Oh, God! You can't take care
of yourself and you have two wives!

1923
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:19,977
Sister, did you solve
Lucky's matter? He left.

1924
01:36:20,153 --> 01:36:22,280
Where did he go?
- Along with his future wife.

1925
01:36:22,455 --> 01:36:24,218
l called out to him,
but he didn't stop.

1926
01:36:24,624 --> 01:36:27,184
What you all want
will never happen.

1927
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,652
She'll ruin his life.

1928
01:36:29,062 --> 01:36:31,895
She won't ruin.
She has already ruined mine.

1929
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:38,094
Give me the pen drive quickly.

1930
01:36:38,171 --> 01:36:39,399
Yes, give me the pen drive quickly.

1931
01:36:39,572 --> 01:36:40,766
What will you do
with the pen drive?

1932
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,967
When did l ask for it?
- l asked for it.

1933
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:51,839
Fateh?

1934
01:36:52,218 --> 01:36:53,810
Who's this huge man?

1935
01:36:54,153 --> 01:36:55,279
Jackie. - Brother.

1936
01:36:55,788 --> 01:36:57,585
Tell them who l am.
- He's my father.

1937
01:36:57,924 --> 01:37:01,087
Not my personal introduction.
Tell them my profession.

1938
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,889
My father is a very
well-settled don.

1939
01:37:03,129 --> 01:37:04,756
Fateh, how did you come here?

1940
01:37:05,098 --> 01:37:08,761
l always go where you go.

1941
01:37:08,901 --> 01:37:11,199
Where you go.

1942
01:37:11,704 --> 01:37:14,935
What did you think?
That you'd take the pen drive?

1943
01:37:15,508 --> 01:37:16,475
Where's the pen drive?

1944
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:19,010
lf you give him the pen drive,
then l'll tell your wives..

1945
01:37:19,078 --> 01:37:20,739
..that you came to
meet me at the hotel.

1946
01:37:20,813 --> 01:37:22,007
Jackie. - Brother.

1947
01:37:22,548 --> 01:37:24,448
Tell them what your father can do.

1948
01:37:24,517 --> 01:37:26,280
My father makes delicious curry.

1949
01:37:26,519 --> 01:37:28,419
Not personal. Professional.

1950
01:37:28,488 --> 01:37:30,615
My father kills people ruthlessly.

1951
01:37:30,857 --> 01:37:33,291
The murder from which
you four are trying to escape..

1952
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,154
..was done by my father.

1953
01:37:35,628 --> 01:37:36,822
Now what's all this?

1954
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:38,388
l'll tell you.

1955
01:37:38,798 --> 01:37:41,164
When you pushed me and left
the hotel room the other day..

1956
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:43,166
Get lost! Strange.

1957
01:37:43,436 --> 01:37:45,233
You pushed me? Get lost!

1958
01:37:52,178 --> 01:37:55,113
'After you left, l removed
the mobile with a pen drive.'

1959
01:37:56,516 --> 01:37:58,916
'And l decided to call
Mukhtiar Singh for money.'

1960
01:38:00,086 --> 01:38:01,075
Shefi.

1961
01:38:01,587 --> 01:38:03,748
l never thought that
you would do this to me.

1962
01:38:04,123 --> 01:38:06,023
l was the one who brought
you the pen drive.

1963
01:38:06,392 --> 01:38:08,292
The money will be split into two.

1964
01:38:10,129 --> 01:38:11,118
Not two.

1965
01:38:12,398 --> 01:38:13,387
Three.

1966
01:38:14,434 --> 01:38:18,632
You clicked the photos with
my help, and you're betraying me?

1967
01:38:19,238 --> 01:38:20,603
We don't have the pen drive.

1968
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,035
No problem. Think and
tell me who has the pen drive.

1969
01:38:23,976 --> 01:38:24,965
Take your time.

1970
01:38:25,712 --> 01:38:26,940
l'll give you two options.

1971
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:30,115
The first option is phone a friend.
You can use it.

1972
01:38:30,483 --> 01:38:32,212
We really don't know
where the pen drive is.

1973
01:38:32,552 --> 01:38:33,610
The second option..

1974
01:38:34,921 --> 01:38:35,945
Shoot a friend.

1975
01:38:37,223 --> 01:38:40,420
Fateh, please don't
shoot my friend.

1976
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:43,253
Please don't tell me what to do.

1977
01:38:44,364 --> 01:38:46,264
l'm the boss here.

1978
01:38:53,606 --> 01:38:55,096
Hey! Where did the other one go?

1979
01:38:56,909 --> 01:38:58,376
She's down. - She's down?

1980
01:38:59,479 --> 01:39:00,878
Thank you so much.

1981
01:39:28,808 --> 01:39:30,833
Shefi. Shefi.

1982
01:39:32,145 --> 01:39:33,134
Shefi.

1983
01:39:35,615 --> 01:39:36,946
No, no. No one fell.

1984
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:38,949
He said there was
a tiff between them.

1985
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:40,551
But it looks like there
was a big fight here.

1986
01:39:41,988 --> 01:39:43,080
Ms. Shefi.

1987
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:45,179
Shefi.

1988
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:48,925
Did he kill the girl?

1989
01:39:49,429 --> 01:39:50,760
'l got an idea hearing this.'

1990
01:39:58,137 --> 01:40:00,662
Blood.. Blood. Blood.

1991
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,537
Blood.. Blood.

1992
01:40:09,682 --> 01:40:10,842
There was no one downstairs.

1993
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:15,110
Don't think that l've come
to conduct your last rites.

1994
01:40:15,655 --> 01:40:17,145
l've come to look
for the pen drive.

1995
01:40:23,663 --> 01:40:25,631
Please.. Please don't kill me.

1996
01:40:26,799 --> 01:40:29,859
Even if you kill me and take the
pen drive, what will you achieve?

1997
01:40:30,436 --> 01:40:31,801
You will be imprisoned.

1998
01:40:32,338 --> 01:40:33,965
Four foolish men have come here.

1999
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,937
They thought this
tomato sauce is blood.

2000
01:40:36,909 --> 01:40:38,900
They think l'm dead
instead of Sonia.

2001
01:40:39,745 --> 01:40:40,803
lf you help me..

2002
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,414
..we'll accuse them
of Sonia's murder..

2003
01:40:43,649 --> 01:40:44,980
..and divide the money.

2004
01:40:46,385 --> 01:40:47,943
l don't trust models.

2005
01:40:48,588 --> 01:40:50,488
They are very good in deceiving.

2006
01:40:50,957 --> 01:40:53,551
Please trust me.
l won't betray you.

2007
01:41:00,366 --> 01:41:02,425
Now hurry up.
Before they come into the room..

2008
01:41:02,668 --> 01:41:05,262
..take the dead body and
hide in the cupboard. - Okay.

2009
01:41:17,884 --> 01:41:21,684
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

2010
01:41:35,935 --> 01:41:37,835
The corpse sneezed. Ghost! Ghost!

2011
01:41:46,045 --> 01:41:47,740
Come on,
let's quickly wrap the body.

2012
01:41:49,549 --> 01:41:50,743
Let me clean the sauce.

2013
01:41:55,821 --> 01:41:57,584
This is Lucky's unlucky story.

2014
01:42:01,494 --> 01:42:03,394
Lucky, l found this
phone under the bed.

2015
01:42:05,665 --> 01:42:07,064
Put it inside. - Take it. Take it.

2016
01:42:07,466 --> 01:42:10,458
Fast. - Hurry up.
Nothing should be left out.

2017
01:42:12,738 --> 01:42:14,365
This is Lucky's..

2018
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:16,201
This is Lucky's..

2019
01:42:18,477 --> 01:42:20,069
Oh, no. - What happened?

2020
01:42:20,379 --> 01:42:22,472
The pen drive is in my mobile
and the mobile is in my bag.

2021
01:42:22,848 --> 01:42:24,816
The battery?
- The battery is in the purse.

2022
01:42:26,052 --> 01:42:29,647
l am stuck with all the idiots.
Now come downstairs.

2023
01:42:40,433 --> 01:42:43,732
'We reached there after
you threw the corpse.'

2024
01:43:00,987 --> 01:43:02,511
'We found the corpse.'

2025
01:43:05,091 --> 01:43:06,422
'But not the pen drive.'

2026
01:43:08,728 --> 01:43:10,457
You're applauding?

2027
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:12,795
Your grandma hasn't
narrated a story.

2028
01:43:13,532 --> 01:43:15,591
Hurry up. Give me the pen drive.

2029
01:43:15,735 --> 01:43:18,226
Don't give him the pen drive.
l have a share in it too.

2030
01:43:18,437 --> 01:43:21,235
He will split you into two anyway.
Give it to him. - No.

2031
01:43:21,307 --> 01:43:22,365
Jackie. - Brother.

2032
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:23,967
Why are we asking
for the pen drive?

2033
01:43:24,076 --> 01:43:25,771
l think we like to ask.

2034
01:43:25,978 --> 01:43:28,003
Come on. Look for the pen drive.

2035
01:43:29,615 --> 01:43:32,049
l think the pen drive
is somewhere over here. - Okay.

2036
01:43:32,418 --> 01:43:33,248
Hit the torch.

2037
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:34,308
Where? - Over here.

2038
01:43:34,387 --> 01:43:35,376
Okay.

2039
01:43:37,356 --> 01:43:38,789
l meant hit the light.
- Sorry, father.

2040
01:43:39,025 --> 01:43:40,185
The light is broken now.

2041
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:42,525
l've noticed that
birthdays are Jinxed.

2042
01:43:42,695 --> 01:43:44,458
First we got into
trouble on your birthday.

2043
01:43:44,597 --> 01:43:46,895
And now, Chaku's birthday
has turned into our death day.

2044
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:49,793
We won't celebrate anyone's
birthdays ever. l promise.

2045
01:43:49,869 --> 01:43:51,302
You won't accept your mistake.

2046
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,903
Brother, please. l have a request.

2047
01:43:53,072 --> 01:43:56,269
Kill me separately. At least my
soul will be away from bad company.

2048
01:43:56,442 --> 01:43:57,636
We must at least die together.

2049
01:43:58,010 --> 01:43:59,341
Sir, we checked the whole house.

2050
01:43:59,412 --> 01:44:00,504
We didn't find the
pen drive anywhere.

2051
01:44:01,714 --> 01:44:03,443
Tell me where the pen drive is.

2052
01:44:04,150 --> 01:44:05,742
l will count only till five. One.

2053
01:44:06,118 --> 01:44:09,144
Brother, you may take my lpad,
lpod, lphone, everything..

2054
01:44:09,221 --> 01:44:11,553
..but only Lucky knows where
the pen drive is. lt's clear.

2055
01:44:11,657 --> 01:44:12,487
Two.

2056
01:44:12,558 --> 01:44:14,822
Brother, count slowly. Sometimes
it takes a little longer..

2057
01:44:14,894 --> 01:44:16,521
..for a person to get
into the mood to talk. - Yes.

2058
01:44:16,595 --> 01:44:18,187
People ask for one's
last wish before their death..

2059
01:44:18,297 --> 01:44:19,457
..but you're asking
for a pen drive.

2060
01:44:19,598 --> 01:44:21,065
Why are you so advanced? - Three.

2061
01:44:21,967 --> 01:44:23,901
One minute, father.
Don't do anything illegal.

2062
01:44:24,136 --> 01:44:26,001
We'll get the license
of this pistol tomorrow.

2063
01:44:26,572 --> 01:44:27,561
Use this.

2064
01:44:28,374 --> 01:44:30,740
Good boy. License to kill.

2065
01:44:31,577 --> 01:44:32,100
Four.

2066
01:44:32,178 --> 01:44:34,408
Lucky, you will be doomed.
Tell him.

2067
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:36,775
And this headache with us,
will destroy our houses.

2068
01:44:36,949 --> 01:44:38,075
l don't know about destroy..

2069
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:41,347
.. but if he counts till five, there
will surely be vans outside our houses.

2070
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,853
Hey Shera. - No one is yours.

2071
01:44:42,922 --> 01:44:44,287
Hey Shera. - No one is yours.

2072
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:45,721
Hey Shera. - No one is yours.

2073
01:44:45,825 --> 01:44:47,156
Hey Shera. - No one is yours.

2074
01:44:47,293 --> 01:44:48,692
Hey Shera. - No one is yours.

2075
01:44:48,928 --> 01:44:50,327
Brother, forget this blackmail.

2076
01:44:50,463 --> 01:44:53,330
l'll work hard and earn
2-3 crore rupees and give you.

2077
01:44:53,432 --> 01:44:54,364
Please let me go.

2078
01:44:54,467 --> 01:44:56,435
He's talking nonsense.
He won't work hard.

2079
01:44:56,702 --> 01:44:57,999
He's a live-in son-in-law already.

2080
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:59,697
Leave me alone at least sometimes.

2081
01:44:59,772 --> 01:45:01,899
You roam around with us all the
time. But when it's time to die..

2082
01:45:01,974 --> 01:45:02,998
..you're backing out?

2083
01:45:03,075 --> 01:45:04,565
You settle down in heaven first.
l'll come later.

2084
01:45:04,777 --> 01:45:07,041
You're sitting here and fighting.
Think of how we can escape.

2085
01:45:07,213 --> 01:45:10,671
They have tied us so tightly
that we can't even breathe.

2086
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:12,308
You're talking about escaping?

2087
01:45:12,585 --> 01:45:13,643
Father, they won't keep quiet.

2088
01:45:14,053 --> 01:45:15,680
You'll have to say
'five' right away.

2089
01:45:17,123 --> 01:45:17,919
Five!

2090
01:45:18,023 --> 01:45:19,012
Lucky!

2091
01:45:19,091 --> 01:45:21,559
You scoundrel! You lowly man!

2092
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:22,524
Hey! Hello!

2093
01:45:22,595 --> 01:45:24,654
How dare you go to
the hotel with this witch!

2094
01:45:24,897 --> 01:45:27,593
And you're sitting so close to her!
- l'm not sitting. l've been tied.

2095
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:29,463
And l told Mr.
Don, tie her with them.

2096
01:45:29,535 --> 01:45:31,526
They are talking nonsense.

2097
01:45:31,704 --> 01:45:34,229
No matter what you say,
l won't spare you today!

2098
01:45:34,507 --> 01:45:36,270
What are you waiting for? Shoot me.

2099
01:45:36,442 --> 01:45:37,932
l'll shoot you today!

2100
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:41,136
Why would you shoot me? She was
the one who took me to the hotel.

2101
01:45:41,447 --> 01:45:42,846
l'll kill everyone today!

2102
01:45:42,982 --> 01:45:45,576
Five! - lt's five.
Listen to father too.

2103
01:45:45,751 --> 01:45:48,311
Sister-in-law,
listen to us calmly first.

2104
01:45:48,487 --> 01:45:50,387
Your wives and you are
responsible for everything.

2105
01:45:50,489 --> 01:45:51,820
They want to get him
married to someone else.

2106
01:45:51,957 --> 01:45:55,290
What are you father and son waiting
for? Do you want to sell the guns?

2107
01:45:55,494 --> 01:45:56,290
Shoot everyone.

2108
01:45:56,362 --> 01:45:57,920
You want to get us killed too?

2109
01:45:57,997 --> 01:45:59,897
How do l shoot?
Get rid of her first.

2110
01:46:00,132 --> 01:46:01,258
You don't come in between, brother.

2111
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:06,463
Sister, you've come in between.
Please move aside. l want to shoot.

2112
01:46:06,539 --> 01:46:09,474
Here you go. Shoot him!
Shoot! - Thank you, aunt.

2113
01:46:09,608 --> 01:46:10,597
Seerat.

2114
01:46:12,511 --> 01:46:13,478
Brother.

2115
01:46:13,546 --> 01:46:14,877
Now who are they?

2116
01:46:15,047 --> 01:46:17,379
Look at this. We were lying, right?

2117
01:46:17,616 --> 01:46:18,844
What's going on, Lucky?

2118
01:46:19,018 --> 01:46:21,316
A lot of things are going on here.
How many details do l give you?

2119
01:46:21,387 --> 01:46:22,945
You take other girls to the corner?

2120
01:46:23,055 --> 01:46:26,218
Not in the corner. He takes them
to hotel rooms on his birthday.

2121
01:46:26,692 --> 01:46:28,956
The hotel rooms are
worse than corners.

2122
01:46:29,161 --> 01:46:31,391
But he was at a good
hotel on his birthday.

2123
01:46:31,463 --> 01:46:32,657
He says the hotel was good.

2124
01:46:32,865 --> 01:46:35,356
Even if the hotel is good,
it's bad!

2125
01:46:35,968 --> 01:46:38,459
Brother, don't talk in between.
The matter seems serious today.

2126
01:46:38,537 --> 01:46:42,473
Hello, drama company.
Conduct your play at home.

2127
01:46:42,608 --> 01:46:44,838
Don't talk in between.
Mind your own business.

2128
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:45,899
Take him!

2129
01:46:49,248 --> 01:46:50,510
Leave me! l will bite you.

2130
01:46:50,616 --> 01:46:51,605
Jackie. - Brother.

2131
01:46:52,084 --> 01:46:52,812
Cut his throat.

2132
01:46:52,918 --> 01:46:54,146
Let it be, father.
We will spare him.

2133
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:56,415
You're not a priest's son.
You're a don's son.

2134
01:46:56,589 --> 01:46:57,783
Lucky, what is all this?

2135
01:46:58,157 --> 01:47:00,591
Why does everyone ask me?
You can also see what's going on.

2136
01:47:00,693 --> 01:47:01,660
Tie them up.

2137
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,354
One minute, brother.
First tell me what your problem is.

2138
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:06,054
l've come to take my pen drive.

2139
01:47:06,131 --> 01:47:06,961
From which shop?

2140
01:47:07,066 --> 01:47:10,365
l don't work at a computer
hardware shop. l'm a don.

2141
01:47:10,436 --> 01:47:11,027
ln which district?

2142
01:47:11,103 --> 01:47:13,333
He's not a police officer.
He's a don.

2143
01:47:13,939 --> 01:47:16,999
Lucky, explain to your brother-in-law,
or else all of us will be killed.

2144
01:47:17,076 --> 01:47:18,771
l thought only your
brother-in-law is crazy.

2145
01:47:18,844 --> 01:47:19,708
But now l've realized that..

2146
01:47:19,778 --> 01:47:20,767
..all the brothers-in-law
in the world are crazy.

2147
01:47:21,814 --> 01:47:23,179
Will anyone listen to me?

2148
01:47:23,515 --> 01:47:25,483
Brother, what are you thinking about?
Save your sister's relationship.

2149
01:47:25,551 --> 01:47:27,576
Dear, listen to me.
- Please! No one will interfere.

2150
01:47:27,686 --> 01:47:29,278
l'll solve everything myself today.

2151
01:47:29,488 --> 01:47:32,150
Why are you listening to her, brother?
Save your sister's relationship.

2152
01:47:32,324 --> 01:47:34,121
You're the one who has
ruined his sister's life!

2153
01:47:34,393 --> 01:47:35,587
Now you're telling him to save it.

2154
01:47:35,661 --> 01:47:37,891
Look, don't worry.
They've told me everything. - Yes.

2155
01:47:38,097 --> 01:47:39,724
You're still supporting them?

2156
01:47:39,865 --> 01:47:41,196
They have a point.

2157
01:47:43,102 --> 01:47:44,091
Brother?

2158
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:47,300
Now l've come to know
why Lucky crosses his limits.

2159
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:48,838
Because all of you support him!

2160
01:47:49,842 --> 01:47:51,139
l'll kill myself today!

2161
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:52,841
Seerat! - l'll die! - Seerat.

2162
01:47:53,078 --> 01:47:54,705
Give me my pen drive.

2163
01:47:54,847 --> 01:47:56,314
Go after Seerat.

2164
01:47:57,249 --> 01:47:58,238
Go after her.

2165
01:47:58,717 --> 01:48:00,480
Go after Seerat quickly.

2166
01:48:02,054 --> 01:48:06,354
Jackie, go out and check
if this is a mental asylum.

2167
01:48:06,525 --> 01:48:08,686
Father hasn't come
here to watch a circus.

2168
01:48:10,729 --> 01:48:14,130
Lucky, this was the
memento of our love, right?

2169
01:48:14,967 --> 01:48:16,798
l'll drown along with this.

2170
01:48:17,169 --> 01:48:18,830
l'll finish this as well,
along with me.

2171
01:48:19,104 --> 01:48:20,594
Jackie. - Brother.

2172
01:48:20,773 --> 01:48:21,762
Come, sit.

2173
01:48:22,574 --> 01:48:24,542
l'll quit this business.

2174
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:25,799
Take this.

2175
01:48:26,879 --> 01:48:28,972
To run a business
is always difficult.

2176
01:48:30,282 --> 01:48:31,442
This is wrong.

2177
01:48:31,951 --> 01:48:34,317
Mother also does not take you so
lightly as these people are taking you.

2178
01:48:35,821 --> 01:48:37,220
Don't you dare do that!

2179
01:48:37,456 --> 01:48:39,549
Just shut up, you cheat.
Don't order me!

2180
01:48:39,925 --> 01:48:40,857
Please. Listen to me.

2181
01:48:40,926 --> 01:48:43,622
See, she humiliated
you even before dying.

2182
01:48:43,929 --> 01:48:46,363
Sir, the pen drive
is inside the TaJ Mahal.

2183
01:48:46,665 --> 01:48:47,689
Will l have to go to Agra now?

2184
01:48:47,833 --> 01:48:50,666
No, no. lt's in the TaJ
Mahal that Seerat ran away with.

2185
01:48:50,736 --> 01:48:53,102
To hell with everyone!

2186
01:48:53,305 --> 01:48:54,533
Catch her!

2187
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,598
Take me along too!

2188
01:48:57,042 --> 01:48:59,772
What are you waiting here for?
Go and find Seerat!

2189
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:02,343
First tell us who Seerat is.

2190
01:49:02,448 --> 01:49:04,416
The one who ran away is Seerat.

2191
01:49:05,017 --> 01:49:07,542
Oh, God! This confusion
was created by Bunty!

2192
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:09,515
He said she's Seerat.

2193
01:49:09,655 --> 01:49:12,818
lf your sister wasn't here,
l would have abused you a lot.

2194
01:49:13,092 --> 01:49:15,754
sTheeywtaoldimfeathate.

2195
01:49:16,362 --> 01:49:18,262
Lucky, what will you do?

2196
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:21,194
Brother, open my hands first.
l'll go and save Seerat.

2197
01:49:21,266 --> 01:49:22,756
We'll talk about all this later.

2198
01:50:49,154 --> 01:50:50,451
Enough. This is enough.

2199
01:50:50,756 --> 01:50:53,589
The others are quiet after
getting beaten up. l start crying.

2200
01:50:53,959 --> 01:50:55,449
l Just want the TaJ.

2201
01:50:55,561 --> 01:50:56,550
Take the TaJ.

2202
01:50:59,998 --> 01:51:01,932
Seerat. Seerat.

2203
01:51:02,401 --> 01:51:04,164
Seerat. Seerat.

2204
01:51:05,971 --> 01:51:07,632
Where's the TaJ?

2205
01:51:08,674 --> 01:51:09,663
l don't know.

2206
01:51:09,741 --> 01:51:12,175
Really? l'm giving you two options.

2207
01:51:12,444 --> 01:51:14,241
The first option is phone a friend.

2208
01:51:14,713 --> 01:51:16,237
But your friend is unconscious.

2209
01:51:16,448 --> 01:51:17,506
Your second option..

2210
01:51:17,850 --> 01:51:18,839
Shoot the friend.

2211
01:51:23,822 --> 01:51:25,380
Father, l found the pen drive!

2212
01:51:26,959 --> 01:51:29,393
Amazing! Keep the pen drive safely.

2213
01:51:29,761 --> 01:51:31,729
And give the TaJ Mahal
back to Shah Jahan.

2214
01:51:31,897 --> 01:51:34,092
You're amazing, son. Very good.
- Thank you.

2215
01:51:34,166 --> 01:51:37,101
Amazing. You're amazing, son.
Give me. Wonderful, my son.

2216
01:51:37,169 --> 01:51:39,262
lnspector. Arrest them.

2217
01:51:40,772 --> 01:51:42,535
We chased you for
two months, Fateh.

2218
01:51:43,242 --> 01:51:46,734
This is the pen drive which has
Minister Mukhtiar's photos, right?

2219
01:51:47,779 --> 01:51:49,940
You've been charged
for blackmailing and murder.

2220
01:51:50,315 --> 01:51:51,304
Arrest him.

2221
01:51:52,518 --> 01:51:53,507
Seerat.

2222
01:51:54,219 --> 01:51:55,208
Seerat.

2223
01:51:55,387 --> 01:51:56,411
Seerat. Seerat.

2224
01:51:56,622 --> 01:51:57,213
Seerat, get up.

2225
01:51:57,289 --> 01:51:58,722
Stop. Stop. Stop.

2226
01:51:58,891 --> 01:51:59,949
Come.

2227
01:52:01,293 --> 01:52:02,021
Seerat, are you okay?

2228
01:52:02,094 --> 01:52:04,460
Leave me, Lucky. Let me go.
Everything has happened because of you.

2229
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:06,794
lt's all your fault.
l'll never forgive you.

2230
01:52:06,865 --> 01:52:11,199
Seerat, it's all our fault. He didn't
even know where we were taking him.

2231
01:52:11,403 --> 01:52:12,529
lt was our plan.

2232
01:52:12,604 --> 01:52:14,834
Guri, why are you being the
bad guy in front of sister-in-law?

2233
01:52:14,973 --> 01:52:17,066
Shefi was my friend, after all.

2234
01:52:17,376 --> 01:52:18,308
lt's okay.

2235
01:52:18,377 --> 01:52:19,901
Why do you say that?
lt wasn't your fault.

2236
01:52:20,245 --> 01:52:22,179
This was all our doing.

2237
01:52:22,281 --> 01:52:24,909
lt's okay. People's intentions
become bad sometimes.

2238
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:26,107
And you people are lowly anyway.

2239
01:52:26,218 --> 01:52:27,515
There was nothing bad on your mind.

2240
01:52:27,586 --> 01:52:30,077
Why should we lie?
Only your intentions were clean.

2241
01:52:30,189 --> 01:52:32,020
Whenever we've gone
for such a proJect before..

2242
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:34,684
..we packed our clothes later,
but spoilt our intentions first.

2243
01:52:34,826 --> 01:52:35,758
What do we tell you?

2244
01:52:35,827 --> 01:52:38,261
When you were alone in the hotel
room with Shefi the other day..

2245
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:40,355
..we imagined a lot
of things when we came out.

2246
01:52:40,532 --> 01:52:42,329
Lucky, you were alone
with her in the room?

2247
01:52:42,434 --> 01:52:44,766
No, no. l pushed her and left.

2248
01:52:44,937 --> 01:52:47,132
You leave.
l'll solve my problems myself.

2249
01:52:47,206 --> 01:52:49,174
Sister-in-law, don't misunderstand.
The girl was wrong.

2250
01:52:49,241 --> 01:52:51,106
He didn't even touch
the girl's corpse.

2251
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:52,534
You killed the girl?

2252
01:52:53,145 --> 01:52:54,271
Get lost!

2253
01:52:54,379 --> 01:52:56,074
Now l know that you are ill-fated.

2254
01:52:56,248 --> 01:52:57,977
Wherever you go,
you create problems.

2255
01:52:58,083 --> 01:53:00,449
We are ill-fated?

2256
01:53:00,586 --> 01:53:02,611
We tried so much to help you.

2257
01:53:02,721 --> 01:53:04,018
Your help got me in trouble.

2258
01:53:04,089 --> 01:53:04,851
We got you in trouble?

2259
01:53:04,957 --> 01:53:08,620
On your engagement day, did we
tell you to hug your ex-girlfriend?

2260
01:53:08,694 --> 01:53:10,855
Scoundrels!
You're refreshing her memory!

2261
01:53:10,929 --> 01:53:13,830
We saved you from being charged
for the girl's murder in the hotel.

2262
01:53:13,999 --> 01:53:16,229
Hey! Why are you talking
about the murder on the street?

2263
01:53:16,301 --> 01:53:17,268
You'll get us in trouble again.

2264
01:53:17,336 --> 01:53:19,531
What do you mean again?
Did l get you in trouble before?

2265
01:53:19,605 --> 01:53:20,537
Who else did it?

2266
01:53:20,606 --> 01:53:22,369
Neither would you have
gone into the girl's room..

2267
01:53:22,441 --> 01:53:23,999
..nor would you have given
us the news of her death.

2268
01:53:24,076 --> 01:53:25,566
l didn't want to go there for fun.

2269
01:53:25,711 --> 01:53:26,939
l had gone there
to solve the issue.

2270
01:53:27,012 --> 01:53:28,445
Was it the Kashmir issue that..

2271
01:53:28,513 --> 01:53:30,208
..if we had gone there,
we would have ruined it?

2272
01:53:30,282 --> 01:53:32,842
Why are you using such language?
She's my friend.

2273
01:53:33,018 --> 01:53:35,782
What friend? When she died,
you didn't shed a single tear.

2274
01:53:35,854 --> 01:53:38,982
Why will l cry?
Did she die of electric shock?

2275
01:53:39,091 --> 01:53:40,080
He killed her.

2276
01:53:40,225 --> 01:53:41,624
l didn't kill her. lt was sauce.

2277
01:53:41,693 --> 01:53:43,320
Couldn't you have
seen the sauce before?

2278
01:53:43,495 --> 01:53:45,895
You should have tasted it.
You are like a dog.

2279
01:53:45,998 --> 01:53:46,760
Live-in son-in-law!

2280
01:53:46,865 --> 01:53:48,025
You're saying that
l'm a live-in son-in-law?

2281
01:53:48,133 --> 01:53:49,122
Have l married your sister?

2282
01:53:49,234 --> 01:53:50,201
lf you had married our sister..

2283
01:53:50,269 --> 01:53:51,634
..we would have thrown
you into a well.

2284
01:53:51,737 --> 01:53:53,170
We would have gotten our
sister married to a better man.

2285
01:53:53,272 --> 01:53:54,364
Am l not a good man?

2286
01:53:54,506 --> 01:53:55,632
l take care of everything.

2287
01:53:55,774 --> 01:53:58,208
Have you married your
wife or adopted her?

2288
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,776
Yes.

2289
01:53:58,844 --> 01:54:00,675
Our wives are roaming
on the streets?

2290
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:02,178
Yours is roaming.

2291
01:54:02,314 --> 01:54:03,941
You don't say anything.

2292
01:54:04,016 --> 01:54:05,108
Because of you guys
she is in this state.

2293
01:54:05,183 --> 01:54:07,151
Have we taken away
the papers of her house?

2294
01:54:07,219 --> 01:54:09,187
What will you take papers?

2295
01:54:10,389 --> 01:54:12,084
You are sitting in
someone else's house.

2296
01:54:12,157 --> 01:54:14,955
You know, he would hug your
friend thinking that she was dead.

2297
01:54:15,027 --> 01:54:17,120
His living wife doesn't
let him touch her.

2298
01:54:17,229 --> 01:54:18,662
He wanted to feel
a dead woman. - Yes.

2299
01:54:18,764 --> 01:54:20,493
What? You were with him too.

2300
01:54:20,999 --> 01:54:22,694
So what if l hugged a dead woman?

2301
01:54:22,868 --> 01:54:24,927
Did anything happen to the corpse?
lt was going to decompose anyway.

2302
01:54:25,003 --> 01:54:26,561
Shefi is my friend.

2303
01:54:26,772 --> 01:54:30,367
l was craving to hug a living
woman and you hugged a dead woman?

2304
01:54:30,475 --> 01:54:32,443
Sorry. - lt's all right.

2305
01:54:32,678 --> 01:54:34,009
Listen to me. Never mind.

2306
01:54:34,146 --> 01:54:36,910
Now get her bailed and hug
her as much as you want. Okay?

2307
01:54:37,482 --> 01:54:39,712
What do you mean? We'll
have an equal share in the bail.

2308
01:54:39,951 --> 01:54:41,213
And in the hug as well. Yes. - Yes.

2309
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:43,083
We'll hug you.

2310
01:54:43,955 --> 01:54:44,944
We are doomed.

2311
01:54:45,457 --> 01:54:46,549
Sorry, darling.

2312
01:54:47,659 --> 01:54:50,526
Seerat, the boy is fit.
He ran and saved you.

2313
01:54:50,762 --> 01:54:52,229
l wouldn't even be able to run.

2314
01:55:06,511 --> 01:55:11,005
l'll dance with
you wearing a suit.

2315
01:55:13,418 --> 01:55:16,785
l'll dance with
you wearing a suit.

2316
01:55:16,888 --> 01:55:19,584
Play an lndian song.

2317
01:55:21,226 --> 01:55:23,854
She says she wants to do bhangra.

2318
01:55:24,663 --> 01:55:26,858
She says she wants to do bhangra.

2319
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,401
l'll dance with
you wearing a suit.

2320
01:55:32,471 --> 01:55:34,837
Play an lndian song.

2321
01:55:36,808 --> 01:55:39,072
She says she wants to do bhangra.

2322
01:55:40,278 --> 01:55:42,644
She says she wants to do bhangra.

2323
01:55:50,722 --> 01:55:55,125
Have got a red sweater.

2324
01:55:55,827 --> 01:56:00,161
All boys are wearing it.

2325
01:56:02,834 --> 01:56:06,235
lts not easy to get love.

2326
01:56:06,304 --> 01:56:08,431
Play an lndian song.

2327
01:56:10,542 --> 01:56:12,908
She says she wants to do bhangra.

2328
01:56:14,112 --> 01:56:16,706
She says she wants to do bhangra.

2329
01:56:17,549 --> 01:56:19,278
She says she wants to do bhangra.

2330
01:56:34,733 --> 01:56:39,500
She came with heels.

2331
01:56:39,938 --> 01:56:44,432
Girls have to cut behind.

2332
01:56:46,978 --> 01:56:50,414
l want to try on the DJ.

2333
01:56:50,482 --> 01:56:52,677
Play an lndian song.

2334
01:56:54,786 --> 01:56:56,981
She says she wants to do bhangra.

She says she wants to do bhangra.

2336
01:57:01,693 --> 01:57:03,684
She says she wants to do bhangra.

2337
01:57:05,096 --> 01:57:07,087
She says she wants to do bhangra.
