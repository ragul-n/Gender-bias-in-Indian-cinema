1
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,458
I'll talk to him, sir.
Don't worry about that case.

2
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:06,708
I've noted everything.
There's no issue at all.

3
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:10,375
Sir, tell me...

4
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,417
Leave it to me.

5
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,458
Forget it, sir, I'll take care of it.

6
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,875
Psch! Go, sit there.

7
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,375
Nothing, sir.

8
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:36,208
Okay, sir. Don't worry.
It is already with us.

9
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,125
Why do you worry, sir?
The file's at the station

10
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,208
Hey...

11
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,333
Argh!

12
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,375
No, sir, I'm already talking to them.

13
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,750
-Swamy.
-Yes, sir...

14
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,625
-Who is she? What's the matter?
-She just walked in. I don't know either.

15
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,250
Sir, I will call you later.

16
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:02,000
-What's this about?
-My husband is missing.

17
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,250
I looked for him everywhere,
but there's no trace of him.

18
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,083
His phone is switched off as well.

19
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,208
How could he leave a beautiful woman
like you alone for two days?

20
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,167
What is it?

21
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:24,292
Please come in.

22
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,542
Tell me, what happened?

23
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,500
My husband disappeared two days ago.
Not sure what happened.

24
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,500
Hmm... Photo?

25
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,000
I have it, sir.

26
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,083
Ah... Hmm!

27
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,667
-Name?
-Ramya, sir.

28
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,625
-Your husband's name?
-Ah... Karthik.

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,208
What has actually happened?

30
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,083
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

31
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:30,500
<i>Where is everyone?</i>

32
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,292
Who did this?

33
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,875
You have no idea about the pressure
I'm getting from the head office.

34
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,417
Tell me who did this.

35
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,917
Else I'll have to fire all of you.

36
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,417
Sir, please don't scold them.

37
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:13,375
-Why does he ask us to go out?
-We should go out.

38
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,500
Read that letter aloud for them.

39
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,792
It should be an
eye-opener for all of them.

40
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,875
Are you guys happy
that I lost my job?

41
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,833
-Wear your glasses.
-Read it now!

42
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,542
All this buildup...
Oh, God.

43
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:12,917
Very happy!

44
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,833
See you at lunch.

45
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,042
Why are you still working?
We are going to party.

46
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,458
-Why?
-Because you guys got the award.

47
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,958
-What about us?
-Ask the one who got the award.

48
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,417
Damn!

49
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,458
Why do you all look dull?

50
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:31,708
Everyone else is celebrating our success.
Why don't we?

51
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,417
-We also should have a party.
-Yeah!

52
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,250
We're getting ten days off next month.
We'll go to Goa.

53
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,792
Why next month? Let's go next year.

54
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,625
We should party right away.

55
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,375
Then drinks party!

56
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,292
-Biryani party!
-Movie!

57
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,833
-Drinks party first!
-Biryani party!

58
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,458
-We'll watch a movie first.
-Hey...

59
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:50,333
We'll have drinks and biryani
and then we'll watch a movie.

60
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,125
-Hey, get lost!
-Go away!

61
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,583
-Doesn't it sound better?
-Nice idea!

62
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,292
-Hey!
-Superb!

63
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,042
Okay. We'll do as you wish.

64
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,958
She rammed into us, man!

65
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:12,083
Have you lost your mind?
Did you cover your eyes while driving?

66
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,917
Oh God! Lots of scratches.
Now that will cost us.

67
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,458
Give us 50,000.

68
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,792
Hey, we are talking to you.
Where are you from?

69
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,792
Take out 50,000 rupees. Can't you hear us?

70
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:24,750
-Take out! Look at the damage.
-You scraped the paint.

71
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,125
-Come on, pay us!
-Hey, look there!

72
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,625
It's a one-way street.
Get ready to pay the fine.

73
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,833
How dare they change it to one-way
without our permission, dude?

74
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:33,750
I don't know, dude!

75
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,833
Chill, it's manageable!

76
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,542
Come, dude!

77
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:58,042
Just a minute...

78
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,417
Show me your hand.

79
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,167
This might hurt...

80
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,167
-Do we work for the same company?
-Hmm!

81
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,667
-Which department?
-Your name is Karthik, right?

82
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,833
I know you.

83
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,708
-Yeah! And your name?
-Ramya.

84
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,458
I am a bit scared to be around girls
since childhood.

85
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:29,792
My friends often harassed me
when they saw me chatting with a girl.

86
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,917
It's okay.
Here we are, finally.

87
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,333
Time to get to work.
Shall we leave?

88
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,000
Hey, what happened?

89
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,625
Karthik came at
the right time and saved the day.

90
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,458
Had he not come,
I would've been in trouble.

91
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,542
Really? I also had a
minor accident last week.

92
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,292
But not a single person
came forward to help me.

93
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:11,000
-Is it? But why?
-Because I caused the accident!

94
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,500
-Karthik has accepted!
-What has he accepted?

95
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,000
My Facebook friend request, dear.

96
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,792
He didn't accept my friend request
I sent him three months ago,

97
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,125
he accepted yours.

98
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,542
Don't be jealous!

99
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,250
Hope it's not a fake ID.

100
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:43,125
What's funny is that even
a fake ID didn't accept your request.

101
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:47,250
<i>Hi, where are you?</i>
<i>Oh, you're here already?</i>

102
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,375
Yeah, I see you!

103
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,042
I don't have the change, ma'am.
You're from my area, I'll take it later.

104
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,000
All right.

105
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,667
I never imagined
we'd be taking a stroll.

106
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,917
I also didn't expect
you'd accept my friend request.

107
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,292
Why? For accepting the friend request?

108
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,667
No, for getting the best employee award.

109
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,500
Oh, that's not a big deal.

110
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,792
Working in the US is my dream.

111
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:35,333
Mom, I am out here with my friend.

112
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,458
<i>Is that a boy or a girl?</i>

113
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,917
A girl, but it's not
what you think it is, okay?

114
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,458
<i>And what am I thinking?</i>
<i>Is she your girlfriend?</i>

115
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:45,375
I'll call you once I'm free.

116
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,542
Do you share everything with your mom?

117
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,708
Sometimes!

118
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,458
Tell me about your family.

119
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,167
-Don't ask!
-Huh?

120
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,958
They're waiting for me
to get married and go away.

121
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,333
Aren't all parents the same?

122
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:15,125
We're breaking our backs
to achieve our goals...

123
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,125
but they pester us over marriage.

124
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Not bad!
You have a mature outlook on life.

125
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:26,042
Time to go. Shall we?

126
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,417
Shall we take a selfie?

127
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,792
Why?

128
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,292
What is all this, dear?

129
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:12,250
Hey, who is that special one? Come out!

130
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,792
Hmm... Who sent this?
My birthday is next week.

131
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,708
I'm going to Goa trip,
get a cake for me too.

132
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:34,833
There's a crowd here.
Did they shut down the company?

133
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,042
Birthday!

134
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,625
If it's a shutdown, how do
we celebrate birthdays, Karthik?

135
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,000
No shutdown, it's her birthday today.
They are watching us, move!

136
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,333
-You too!
-Hey, I have a client call...

137
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,125
The company is safe, isn't it?

138
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,458
-Yeah!
-Thank God!

139
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,167
Er... I'll leave after eating a piece.

140
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,875
He is ruining our image,
please do something.

141
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,625
He sends the cake anonymously,
also comes to wish you!

142
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,958
-Are these your birthday photos?
-Hmm!

143
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,542
-Let me see...
-No!

144
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,042
Huh? When was this? Ah!

145
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,167
-Look at this!
-Hey, stop it!

146
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:16,625
Hmm! Nice pictures!

147
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,500
I suspected it all along,
but it's confirmed now.

148
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,917
Damn! It's just a selfie
it doesn't mean I love him.

149
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,292
So is he the special one?

150
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,333
I get it now. Hmm, go ahead!

151
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,250
Here comes the call from your special one.

152
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,667
Everything is special from now on.

153
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:12,875
<i>My heart is racing</i>
<i>As this is a new experience</i>

154
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:18,083
<i>I've realized what it is now</i>
<i>My eyes started dreaming</i>

155
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:23,333
<i>Your stare has told me</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>

156
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:28,667
<i>My heart is not in its place</i>
<i>What happened to me?</i>

157
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,583
<i>Oh girl!</i>

158
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,167
<i>Some magic!</i>

159
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,958
<i>You did it to me</i>

160
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:43,042
<i>I'm not sure what this is!</i>

161
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:48,583
<i>Shall I ask you if this is love?</i>

162
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:53,333
<i>I'm not sure what this is!</i>

163
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:58,875
<i>Shall I ask you if this is love?</i>

164
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:04,458
<i>My heart is racing</i>
<i>As this is a new experience</i>

165
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:09,667
<i>I've realized what it is</i>
<i>My eyes started dreaming</i>

166
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:25,167
<i>These moments have</i>
<i>Turned into waves</i>

167
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,375
<i>Does it change my dream?</i>

168
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,125
<i>It startled me</i>

169
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:39,167
<i>A disturbance originated in my heart</i>

170
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:45,042
<i>A yearning for your love</i>
<i>Has risen in my heart</i>

171
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,208
<i>A dream has come true, I'm not sure</i>

172
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:56,458
<i>Don't you start dreaming, oh dear heart</i>
<i>Do you even know what's on her mind?</i>

173
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:01,250
<i>How can I live without you in my heart?</i>

174
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:06,708
<i>Your stare has told me</i>
<i>What's in my heart</i>

175
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:11,833
<i>My heart is not in its place</i>
<i>What happened to me?</i>

176
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,583
<i>Oh girl!</i>

177
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,125
<i>Some magic!</i>

178
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,292
<i>You did it to me</i>

179
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:26,750
<i>I'm not sure what this is!</i>

180
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:31,958
<i>Shall I ask you if this is love?</i>

181
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:37,125
<i>I'm not sure what this is!</i>

182
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:42,708
<i>Shall I ask you if this is love!</i>

183
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,208
What?

184
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,458
I want to tell you something.

185
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,458
Hey, what is it?

186
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:10,792
Not here. I will tell you in Goa.

187
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,208
Just imagine you're in Goa
and now tell me.

188
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,667
I'll tell you, but only in Goa.

189
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,375
Hey... Hey... Hold on!

190
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,208
-Hey you!
-I told you, I'll tell you there. Bye!

191
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,208
<i>Hold on... Hold on...</i>
<i>Hold on for a moment.</i>

192
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:35,167
-Hmm...
-What happened, sir?

193
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,542
I can tell you what happened next.
May I?

194
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,750
What are you saying?
I don't understand.

195
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:48,000
<i>Jenny called Karthik from</i>
<i>the railway station, didn't she?</i>

196
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,833
You are right about the railway
station, but my name is Ramya.

197
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,083
Who is Jenny?

198
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,583
I listened to what
you've telling me, didn't I?

199
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,125
Now I'll talk and you'll listen!

200
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:08,000
<i>A girl named Jenny calls</i>
<i>Karthik from a railway station.</i>

201
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,917
<i>The mobile number you have</i>
<i>dialed is currently not reachable.</i>

202
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,833
-Hey, why are you still here? Come!
-I'm calling Karthik, he's not reachable.

203
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,708
The train is about to depart, hurry.

204
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,375
-Come, come!
-Let's go.

205
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,417
Yes! Hey, hurry.

206
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,167
<i>...Vasco Da Gama...</i>
<i>Yeshwantpur Express...</i>

207
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,875
Hey, hurry, the train is about to move.

208
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,125
Come on. Hurry up.

209
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,458
Yeah, coming!

210
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,208
Where have you gone?

211
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,167
<i>Do you even know how many</i>
<i>times I tried calling you?</i>

212
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,458
Why is it switched off?
Where were you all these days?

213
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,542
Listen, Jenny. My mom
was in a critical condition that day.

214
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,750
<i>-That's why I couldn't come.</i>
-What happened to mom?

215
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,333
You should have called me.

216
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,917
I got panicked
and forgot everything.

217
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,542
I'm at the hospital
for the past two days.

218
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:17,000
Do you know I was so
worried about you?

219
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:19,000
Why are you doing this to me?

220
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,417
<i>I'm missing you badly.</i>

221
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,375
Sorry, Jenny. Please don't cry.

222
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:26,958
Stop it! I had such great plans
for this trip to enjoy with you.

223
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,125
But now, I'm eagerly
waiting for it to get over.

224
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,000
Really, I was so disturbed, Jenny.

225
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,708
Fine, how is mom now?

226
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:55,333
I was very worried,
what if something goes wrong?

227
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,667
Don't say terrible things.
Mom will be fine.

228
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:12,125
Karthik, it's been just one week,
but I missed you a lot.

229
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,792
By the way, what did you get me from Goa?

230
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,917
I brought something.
I'll give it to you later.

231
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,500
Is it? What is it? <i>Feni</i>?

232
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,250
-Hey...
-Argh!

233
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,250
I'm so emotional right now,
but all you could think is <i>Feni</i>?

234
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,083
Yeah! Argh!

235
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,167
Stop it!

236
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,417
-You said you brought something for me?
-Yeah, isn't it?

237
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,708
Huh? Don't look here. Look aside.

238
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,375
Did you like the gift? Have it!

239
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,292
Dude, what's the treat for?

240
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,792
Why do you need a reason? Just enjoy!

241
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,500
Nice logic!

242
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,375
Like my friend who threw a party
without a reason...

243
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:08,542
I hope he did not mix any laxatives
in the food.

244
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,500
You have it, it's okay. Eat!

245
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,958
I love my friends,
I'll eat only after you guys eat.

246
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,167
The girls are coming.

247
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,375
He didn't give us a reason and they
won't eat if we don't give them a reason.

248
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:22,958
Yeah, you were right.

249
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,708
Karthik is throwing us a party.

250
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,417
Have this <i>samosas</i>, fresh ones!

251
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,500
-Order what you want.
-Yeah, sure.

252
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,417
Two plate <i>samosas</i>.

253
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,875
Whoa! The <i>samosa</i> tastes so good.

254
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,375
It tastes so delicious now,
it would've tasted better earlier.

255
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,958
Eat all the <i>samosas</i>.

256
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,333
They did not even ask what's
the occasion and started eating.

257
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,583
-Why did his girlfriend dump him?
-No!

258
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,417
That same girlfriend fell for you.
Is there a reason for that?

259
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,750
No! She liked you?

260
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:53,375
-She liked me too.
-Oh!

261
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:56,583
Raju, Karthik gave me cash,
take the bill.

262
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,625
Okay, madam.

263
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,708
Did Karthik tell you
why he gave this treat?

264
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,500
He's keeping it under wraps.

265
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,125
Actually, we both wanted
to give it together.

266
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:10,042
-He gave it alone?
-What? Together?

267
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,667
Yeah, Sharmi, we got committed.

268
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,417
Actually, we wanted to announce together.

269
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,333
-Hey!
-What?

270
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:51,500
What if anyone comes?

271
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,917
Why is your fan following
in the office is increasing?

272
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,167
Good, isn't it? Argh!

273
00:26:57,167 --> 00:27:01,125
I'll kill you if you eye
anyone else other than me.

274
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:06,125
-Nothing of that sort! Hmm!
-Uh-huh?

275
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,083
Hmm?

276
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:26,542
Hey stop, stop!

277
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:28,708
Divya, can you get down for once?

278
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,625
Why are you getting down here?
What happened?

279
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:38,083
-Karthik and I are going out. Bye!
-Whatever!

280
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,458
-Where shall we go?
-Hmm!

281
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:57,125
What?

282
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,125
-It's your birthday tomorrow, isn't it?
-Yeah!

283
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,167
I want to be the first to wish you.

284
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,208
-That's all?
-Hmm!

285
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:08,208
I was expecting something else...

286
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,250
-Shall we do something?
-Hmm, let's do it!

287
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,917
Jump!

288
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,917
-Why is it so silent in here?
-I'm here, right?

289
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:30,000
-Then?
-I'll freshen up while you watch TV.

290
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:15,542
<i>Shall I come to caress your waist?</i>

291
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,500
<i>My yearning is chasing me</i>

292
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:21,292
<i>Shall I shower you with love</i>
<i>And share all my dreams with you?</i>

293
00:29:23,917 --> 00:29:28,292
<i>Oh the rain of your beauty</i>

294
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:33,542
<i>I shall love you</i>
<i>Even if we fall out of love</i>

295
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:40,917
<i>Why don't you move?</i>
<i>I want to lie down</i>

296
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,125
<i>Why don't you erase the boundaries?</i>

297
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:53,250
<i>I have never felt such passion</i>
<i>For anyone but you</i>

298
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:59,417
<i>I came close to you today</i>
<i>Just because of you</i>

299
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,333
What is it?

300
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:08,542
-Karthik, not now...
-What happened?

301
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,792
We will do it once we are married.

302
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,625
I need to marry you. Is that it?

303
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,042
Are you happy?

304
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,583
Shall we become one and...

305
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:40,375
always stay together like this?

306
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:48,458
<i>I want this moment to last forever.</i>

307
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,458
<i>The happiness of the first rain</i>

308
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:57,000
<i>Is love fun or scary?</i>

309
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:13,250
<i>Is meeting you a boon to me?</i>

310
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,125
<i>Shall I embrace you and say</i>

311
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:18,750
<i>I'm giving away myself</i>
<i>To you at this moment</i>

312
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:25,458
<i>The world has changed</i>
<i>Just because of you</i>

313
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:32,250
<i>This is the time to live together</i>

314
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:38,375
<i>I have never felt such passion</i>
<i>For anyone but you</i>

315
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
<i>I fly high seeing you</i>

316
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,833
Karthik, what's this?

317
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,125
You're dancing here.
Do you know what's happening there?

318
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:57,958
Come I'll tell you. Come!

319
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:04,167
Naresh is going to the US
for the project instead of you.

320
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,708
-What are you saying?
-See it for yourself.

321
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:32,708
Karthik!

322
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:36,292
You gave him my dream project
for a bottle of Scotch.

323
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,792
You just had to ask
and I would've gotten it for you.

324
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,583
-I'll kill you!
-Karthik...

325
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,000
I'll destroy you.

326
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,417
-What is this, Karthik?
-Leave me!

327
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,833
-Greetings, madam.
-How many times do I have to honk?

328
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,875
What were you doing?
Can't you hear?

329
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,208
Come, Karthik!

330
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,292
What are you doing?

331
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,875
Everyone is watching us.

332
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,833
Come!

333
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,667
-I won't spare him!
-Get in.

334
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:46,708
-I'll go to the US...
-Wake up. You're drunk! Have this!

335
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,917
Jenny... sit here.

336
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,875
You think I'm ranting on
because I'm drunk?

337
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,583
No way, Jenny!

338
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:15,125
Don't you know I have been
dreaming to go to the US?

339
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,125
And how hard I've worked for it?

340
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,667
Why do you talk like this?

341
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,417
-You don't understand my pain, Jenny.
-Hey!

342
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:26,167
Naresh is going to the US
instead of me.

343
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,333
That was my dream, Jenny.

344
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,667
I don't want this job anymore.

345
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:34,167
We already have EMIs,
and lots of commitments.

346
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,500
If you quit suddenly, can we
survive with my salary alone? Huh?

347
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:42,750
Oh, so you just need my money.

348
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,583
My goal is of no importance to you.

349
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:46,292
Karthik, I didn't mean that.

350
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,667
I know! You women are like that!

351
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:58,583
-Okay, let's go inside.
-Get lost!

352
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:17,333
Karthik.

353
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:19,625
Kar...

354
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:08,125
Sharmi, did Karthik come to the office?

355
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,958
No, what happened?

356
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,250
Nothing, let me know if he comes in.

357
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:21,875
Why are you crying, dear?

358
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:28,667
Karthik is missing.

359
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:47,125
What are you talking about, sir?

360
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:49,500
You are repeating
exactly what happened to me!

361
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:51,208
What happened to Karthik, sir?

362
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,667
Who the hell is this Jenny?

363
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,417
Stay here.

364
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,458
Did you find Karthik? Where is he?

365
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:30,417
You've lodged a complaint.
We are looking for him.

366
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,833
It's just a complaint for you.

367
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,750
Karthik is my life.

368
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:39,875
I can't live without my husband.

369
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,458
I'll go mad, sir!

370
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,667
Please find my husband.

371
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,042
Who is this girl, sir?

372
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,667
Why does she claim
my husband as her own?

373
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:05,250
What's happening here, sir?

374
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,625
That's not necessary...

375
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,125
I'm unable to understand anything, sir.

376
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,125
Wait a minute, dude.

377
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,333
It was a missing person case till now.

378
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:14,167
Now it's a case of fraud.

379
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,542
Huh?

380
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,542
Sir... stop!

381
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,875
A fraud!

382
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:22,375
This Jayakanth the journalist
has got an interesting case.

383
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,292
As a journalist, I want to find out all...

384
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,583
Eh... he hung up?

385
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,292
<i>-You called, sir?</i>
-Yeah.

386
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,292
<i>Tell me, sir,</i>
<i>do you need any information?</i>

387
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,667
Yes, man.

388
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,000
I just sent you a number.

389
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,917
I need all the details of that number.

390
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:46,917
-Got it?
<i>-Okay, sir.</i>

391
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,833
Ramya,... who is it?

392
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:49,917
-Police.
-Oh...

393
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,250
He is here to question.

394
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,167
Hmm...

395
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:56,833
stay here.

396
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,167
What? Is there any problem?

397
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:02,417
Hmm.

398
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:25,458
Who let you in here?

399
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,167
One of your employees
Mr. Karthik Raghunath,

400
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,500
is being charged with fraud.

401
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,292
He has been missing for two days.

402
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,458
One of your staff,
Ramya has lodged a complaint.

403
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:53,833
This office is at the center
of the cheating case.

404
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:57,625
I need to see the details of
Karthik and his team members.

405
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,417
You can't barge in here
under the pretext of investigation.

406
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:10,542
I have been keeping calm,
but you keep talking shit.

407
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:12,625
Summon them!

408
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,458
Zoom there.

409
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,458
Check the camera five.

410
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,417
Yes, sir...

411
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:31,917
Do you know who she is?

412
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,125
Er...

413
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,500
I know her, sir.
She rented a house here.

414
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,667
Hmm.

415
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:38,750
And him?

416
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:42,875
Yeah! I saw him, sir!

417
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:46,208
I saw him dropping her off
at the park, sir!

418
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:59,125
Show me the CCTV footage
for this bill date.

419
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,542
Sir, we inquired at all places.

420
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,958
We didn't get any clue
or evidence about him.

421
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,917
He planned it perfectly
and left no clue behind.

422
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,208
-Sir, I have an idea.
-Hmm.

423
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,875
We should publish a missing person's
ad in the newspaper...

424
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,250
we might get a lead or two.

425
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:30,875
Okay.

426
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,333
<i>Today's headlines.</i>

427
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:34,958
<i>In a cheating case filed</i>
<i>for marrying multiple girls,</i>

428
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:38,500
<i>the police are investigating</i>
<i>about a young man named Karthik.</i>

429
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:41,333
<i>Since there's no information about him,</i>

430
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:46,750
<i>the police have decided to post</i>
<i>his pictures in crowded places.</i>

431
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,708
<i>Anyone who knows anything about Karthik</i>

432
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:51,375
<i>has to inform the police by calling</i>
<i>the numbers given on the poster,</i>

433
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,583
<i>as ordered by the Deputy Commissioner.</i>

434
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:55,208
What is this?

435
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:59,083
There isn't a single call received
about the missing case?

436
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:26,333
The person who called you is here, sir.

437
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:28,750
Come.

438
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:34,083
-Sir.
-God!

439
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,042
I know him well, sir!

440
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,292
How do you know him?

441
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:47,667
He is my childhood friend.

442
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,542
What? A childhood friend?

443
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:55,083
You look very old
and he is quite young

444
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:57,208
How come he's your friend?

445
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:58,375
I'm telling you the truth, sir!

446
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:01,833
He hasn't gone missing now,
but for many years, sir!

447
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:04,458
What? For many years?

448
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,917
Yes, sir!
I've been looking for him ever since.

449
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,583
I want to see him!

450
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,625
What is this? What the hell is he talking?

451
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:14,000
Huh?

452
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:15,875
They are here!

453
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,250
-They'll take me away...
-Sorry, sir.

454
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,792
-He escaped from the mental hospital.
-He isn't Karthik!

455
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,125
-He is Krishna Murthy, sir.
-Move!

456
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:21,333
-I'm not mad, sir!
-Come on.

457
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:22,583
-I'm telling the truth!
-That's fine

458
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:24,500
He isn't Karthik, but Krishna Murthy.

459
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:25,667
He died long ago, sir!

460
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,917
Let go of me, sir! I'm not crazy!

461
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,333
Believe me, sir!

462
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,875
He isn't Karthik, but Krishna Murthy.

463
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:34,083
Believe me, sir!

464
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:35,667
They are taking me away!

465
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,792
He isn't Karthik, but Krishna Murthy?

466
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:57,042
Sir, what happening?

467
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,250
I filed a missing complaint
for my husband six months ago.

468
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,458
Did you find him?

469
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,792
On top of that, you posted a
missing ad in the newspaper.

470
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:06,875
People have started badmouthing
my husband now.

471
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,750
He isn't a nice person man
as you take him to be.

472
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,333
He's a big fraud.

473
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:17,792
Don't portray my husband as a cheater
to cover up your failure.

474
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,583
I know very well about him.

475
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:33,875
We have a latest update.

476
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,917
A similar case of missing husband
has been filed in Chennai, sir.

477
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,125
Please have a look at its details.

478
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,375
Remember the old man
who came to our station?

479
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,333
Who?

480
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:09,333
The mentally unstable man
who claimed to know Karthik.

481
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:11,667
-Yeah
-Someone brutally killed him, sir.

482
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,875
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

483
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,333
How did the murder
take place in the hospital?

484
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:22,417
How did this...

485
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:25,500
-Let the officer pass, move aside!
-Move aside!

486
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:26,833
Move now!

487
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,167
What is this?

488
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:31,167
-All of you move...
-Move back!

489
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:34,042
Go back.

490
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:38,667
I said, move!

491
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,042
Get out, everyone.

492
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:47,333
-How many times do I say?
-Move out.

493
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:12,417
Everyone is tight-lipped
about this murder, sir.

494
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:20,417
Sir, what are the details?

495
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,750
How did this happen, sir?

496
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:24,458
-Any clue, sir?
-What could be the motive?

497
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:26,125
-Sir, please tell me.
-Move aside.

498
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,583
The man is dead! The man is dead!

499
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:29,917
Move.

500
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:32,792
Stay here.

501
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:37,417
Sir, this trunk belongs
to the deceased Venu Gopal.

502
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,625
Check it.

503
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:52,917
-Pavan, light...
-Sir.

504
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,458
PADMAVATHI STUDIO, PALAKOLLU,
WEST GODAVARI DISTRICT

505
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,750
He looks just like Karthik, sir!

506
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,875
Karthik's picture in Venu Gopal's trunk?

507
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:18,542
I feel very sad, sir.

508
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:22,500
Had we inquired
when he came to our station,

509
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:23,875
maybe, he wouldn't have died.

510
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:27,333
The old man was talking
about a man named Krishna Murthy.

511
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,708
Maybe he is Karthik,
the man we are searching for.

512
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:32,667
He isn't Karthik,
but Krishna Murthy, sir.

513
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,042
I'm not mad, sir! Believe me!

514
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:38,958
If Krishna Murthy is dead,
who is Karthik?

515
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:45,083
Maybe Krishna Murthy possessed Karthik
and committed these murders.

516
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,208
Hey! Shut up, man.

517
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:49,208
Talking about ghosts...

518
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:51,625
-Kumar.
-Sir...

519
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,042
The studio's name is behind the picture.

520
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,250
-Yes, sir.
-Go and inquire there.

521
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:56,583
Okay, sir.

522
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:02,375
A mentally unstable patient Venu Gopal
was brutally killed by unknown assailants.

523
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:04,125
The details of who murdered him...

524
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,542
<i>...stands as a mystery.</i>

525
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,250
<i>The cops aren't responding</i>
<i>the queries about the murder.</i>

526
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,542
<i>People believe the murder</i>
<i>wasn't committed by humans</i>

527
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:15,708
<i>but some kind of</i>
<i>ghost and they're very scared.</i>

528
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:17,833
<i>Let's hear about the details</i>
<i>of the murder according to Burton.</i>

529
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:20,583
<i>Some say the picture found in</i>
<i>Venu Gopal's trunk belongs to Karthik.</i>

530
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,208
<i>But the picture belongs to</i>
<i>Venu Gopal's friend, Krishna Murthy</i>

531
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:24,833
<i>and that he died long back.</i>

532
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:28,125
<i>Hospital sources say that Venu Gopal</i>
<i>used to talk about this frequently.</i>

533
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:29,833
<i>So who is it really in that picture?</i>

534
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:33,500
<i>Let's put this topic aside...</i>

535
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,625
<i>Just like the hero</i>
<i>in Benjamin Button's film</i>

536
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:39,583
<i>has the old Krishna Murthy turned</i>
<i>into the young man Karthik...</i>

537
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:14,583
<i>He isn't Karthik, but Krishna Murthy!</i>

538
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:18,208
<i>That photo belongs to Venu Gopal's friend</i>
<i>Krishna Murthy, and he has been dead</i>

539
00:52:18,292 --> 00:52:20,625
<i>People are believing that the murder</i>
<i>wasn't committed by humans,</i>

540
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:24,333
<i>but some kind of ghosts</i>
<i>and people are very scared.</i>

541
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,125
You dare catch me?

542
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:47,083
Sir, we're getting information
from the Begumpet Railway Station.

543
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,458
<i>Connecting to you, sir...</i>

544
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,958
<i>You're looking for Karthik</i>
<i>and I've seen him.</i>

545
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,375
You're looking for Karthik
and I've seen him.

546
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,292
He is right here, please hurry!

547
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:30,667
He should definitely be
within a ten-kilometer radius.

548
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:33,542
-Alert the police stations, checkpoints.
-Yes, sir.

549
00:54:34,833 --> 00:54:37,292
We got some information about him
after a long time.

550
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:43,958
Has any cab or auto-rickshaw
left from here recently?

551
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,417
I didn't quite notice, sir.

552
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:46,708
Yes, sir!

553
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,583
A cab left just 10 minutes ago.

554
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:49,542
Where did it go?

555
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,083
He asked me if I'd go to Banjara Hills.

556
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:52,458
We failed to agree on the fare.

557
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:53,667
He left in another cab.

558
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,000
Get the details of the cab.

559
00:54:58,125 --> 00:54:59,625
Note the details I'm giving you.

560
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,583
It's an Ola Cab.

561
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,542
The drop point is Madhapur, sir.

562
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:11,333
Reserved under the name of Karthik.

563
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,708
Let's go.

564
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,542
Isn't it the same number?

565
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:27,125
Sir, it's the same number.

566
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,417
-Is it the same cab?
-It is, sir.

567
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:49,958
Karthik! Get down!

568
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,417
Otherwise we'll open fire!

569
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,167
Sir, I think you are mistaken...

570
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,500
Sir! I'm Karthik...

571
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,708
-But...
-Don't come forward.

572
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:06,958
-Please listen to me.
-I'll shoot if you move.

573
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,792
What have I done?
Why are you arresting me?

574
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:25,167
Sir?

575
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,750
<i>Headlines.</i>

576
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:29,833
<i>The police have taken a young man named</i>
<i>Karthik into custody for questioning,</i>

577
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:33,542
<i>in the case of polygamy and cheating</i>
<i>which took place in the city.</i>

578
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:35,917
-Why are you hitting me?
-Hit him... hard!

579
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,417
-You play with lives?
-I don't know anything, sir.

580
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,792
-You cheat girls?
-No, sir.

581
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,083
-I don't know anything, sir.
-Hit him hard!

582
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:42,875
Don't hit me, sir!

583
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,250
-I don't know anything!
-Karthik!

584
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:47,417
Why are you hitting me? Don't do it!

585
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,000
Ask them not to hit my husband.

586
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,292
Please stop it! Stop!

587
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,042
Please! Karthik!

588
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:56,625
Why are you hitting him
instead of handing him over to me?

589
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,500
Please let him go, sir.

590
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,875
Karthik...

591
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,875
Where were you all these days?

592
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,000
Did you not miss me?

593
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,000
What happened to you?

594
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,042
Who are you?

595
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,375
Sir, who is this girl?

596
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,583
Karthik, what are you saying?

597
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:19,708
Sir!

598
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,625
Didn't I tell you she is lying?

599
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,208
My husband isn't a cheat, sir.

600
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:27,083
Karthik, where were you all these days?

601
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:28,958
What is happening here?

602
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,458
First find out who she is, sir.

603
00:57:31,542 --> 00:57:32,917
Hey! Who the hell are you now?

604
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:37,917
How dare you
play tricks in front of us!

605
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,667
-Don't hit him, sir!
-Please don't hit him.

606
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,917
<i>-Please stop!</i>
<i>-Stop it.</i>

607
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,583
Kishore... stop.

608
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:47,833
So, you don't know both of them.

609
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:50,458
I really don't know them, sir.

610
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:52,417
Swamy...

611
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:54,708
Send the girls out.

612
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:06,125
All of this pertain to the cheating
and murder cases filed against you.

613
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:09,375
Do you deny all of them?

614
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:14,250
Ramya, Jenny, Venu Gopal.
I don't know any of them.

615
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:18,042
I've worked at the office you mentioned.

616
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:21,417
Take me there and
I can prove my innocence, sir.

617
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:37,083
Do you recognize this area?

618
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:39,667
I don't, sir.

619
00:58:43,292 --> 00:58:44,375
Greetings, madam.

620
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:46,417
-Greetings, sir!
-Huh?

621
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:47,750
You said you don't know?

622
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,125
So you're back!

623
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,833
Did Ramya and he work in this office?

624
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:19,167
Yes, they did.

625
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,958
-What are you saying?
-He is being weird?

626
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:23,625
-Sir, please believe me.
-What's there to believe now?

627
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:25,125
I don't understand
why they are talking this way.

628
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,208
<i>-Get in!</i>
<i>-Sir, believe me!</i>

629
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,042
Our inquiry proved that
Karthik cheated those three girls.

630
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:34,167
But, Venu Gopal's murder...

631
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:37,333
There is no evidence to prove
Karthik killed him.

632
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:41,125
No, Swamy.

633
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,958
Something is missing.

634
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,167
What is this, man?

635
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:12,250
The evidence clearly
shows you are the culprit.

636
01:00:13,417 --> 01:00:14,542
Do you accept the charges?

637
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,542
Sir, nothing they claim is true.

638
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,667
I don't understand
what's happening here, sir.

639
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:20,833
I was in Mumbai
for the last six months.

640
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:23,417
The court can't just take your words.

641
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,333
We need a witness.

642
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:29,125
I'll appoint a lawyer
and submit everything you need.

643
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,542
Give me some time, sir.

644
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:33,375
What the hell is all this?

645
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:34,750
Take him into custody.

646
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:36,417
Investigate well.

647
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,708
Don't waste court's time.

648
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,542
I'm giving you a week's time.

649
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:43,208
<i>Sir...</i>

650
01:00:43,292 --> 01:00:44,833
Like that Venu Gopal said...

651
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:49,708
Is there anyone with the name of
Krishna Murthy in that village?

652
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:52,125
<i>We didn't get any</i>
<i>details about him yet, sir.</i>

653
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:53,958
<i>We're still inquiring,</i>
<i>give us sometime.</i>

654
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:54,917
Hmm.

655
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,708
I'll call you later. Bye.

656
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:15,792
Yes?

657
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:24,042
Yeah.

658
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:29,542
See, sir.

659
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,083
-Do you have any proof?
-Yes, sir.

660
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:36,333
Marriage certificate.

661
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,833
Aadhar cards.

662
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:41,042
Joint bank account.

663
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,167
Passports.

664
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:44,792
One minute, sir.

665
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:49,875
Our marriage photos.

666
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:59,375
-How long?
-Since yesterday.

667
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,542
-Since yesterday?
-Yeah.

668
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,917
What is she talking about?

669
01:02:04,417 --> 01:02:06,375
We've been holding Karthik
for a week now.

670
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,333
She says
he's been missing since yesterday?

671
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,458
Maybe...

672
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,583
Maybe there is another person
who looks like Karthik?

673
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:16,875
Hey!

674
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:08,917
Yes.

675
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:10,667
Okay.

676
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:19,417
Hey!

677
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,708
Leave me, sir! Leave me!

678
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:39,125
<i>Priya.</i>

679
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:41,000
Priya.

680
01:03:43,292 --> 01:03:44,417
Priya.

681
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,667
Why did you shoot him?

682
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,667
He shouldn't be alive, sir.

683
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:03,417
If he lives, he will cheat more girls.

684
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:09,542
I lied that Karthik was
missing since yesterday.

685
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:12,875
We were separated year ago.

686
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,375
<i>Ours was a love match, sir.</i>

687
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:18,458
<i>We were very happy for sometime.</i>

688
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:19,958
<i>But one day...</i>

689
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,625
<i>He decided to quit his job</i>
<i>all of a sudden.</i>

690
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:24,500
<i>Since then...</i>

691
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,458
<i>We started fighting.</i>

692
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,792
Even after he left me...

693
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:31,083
I thought he was probably leading
a normal life.

694
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:35,083
But I think he cheated me
like he cheated others.

695
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:38,250
He shouldn't be alive, sir.

696
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,667
That's why I shot him.

697
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:47,083
He denied knowing those three girls
though we thrashed him.

698
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:53,083
But now he is chanting your name
even after you shot him.

699
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,417
Karthik has escaped
from the hospital, sir!

700
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:03,000
Swamy, alert the police stations
and checkpoints.

701
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:04,000
I'll take care of it, sir.

702
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:07,375
Karthik, come back!

703
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:12,500
Stop there!

704
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:20,458
Karthik! Hey!

705
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:28,542
He's on the streets when
I expected him to be at the hospital.

706
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:30,208
Wait.

707
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,417
Hey!

708
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:48,500
-Let go!
-Got you!

709
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:49,875
-You can't escape now.
-Leave me!

710
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:51,792
-Who are you?
-Who am I?

711
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,542
Do you know journalist Jayakanth?

712
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:54,875
I'm Journalist Jayakanth!

713
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,167
You've cheated three innocent girls.

714
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,042
You've killed an old man without mercy.

715
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,833
I'll hand you over to the cops!

716
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:01,958
-Police!
-Sir!

717
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,708
I didn't commit any crime, sir.

718
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:06,583
I'll tell you some details about
this case which no one knows, sir.

719
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,083
Please help me, sir.

720
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:10,958
-You'll tell me the details no one knows?
-Yeah.

721
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,083
Really?

722
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:13,667
-Karthik!
-The police are here, sir!

723
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:15,333
-Let's get on bike.
-They're heading here.

724
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:16,250
-They are here.
-Karthik!

725
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,333
-It doesn't start right away.
-Sir, please hurry!

726
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:20,458
Sir, they are already here.
Please move.

727
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,583
Karthik...

728
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,125
I've tried a lot, sir.

729
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:39,875
But he drove away on someone's bike.

730
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:41,458
<i>Sir, sorry, sir.</i>

731
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,875
I'll catch him.
I'll use the license plate.

732
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,292
Do something immediately!

733
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:54,500
Call the three girls
and tell them to be careful.

734
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:55,417
Okay, sir.

735
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,625
I don't understand
who those three girls are

736
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:01,458
and why they are calling me
their husband, sir!

737
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:04,708
Okay, then what about
the girl who shot you?

738
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:08,667
She is my wife Priya, sir.

739
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,250
Eh? What?

740
01:07:10,917 --> 01:07:12,417
Did your wife shot you?

741
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,542
Yes, sir.

742
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:14,958
Give me a minute.

743
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,667
Okay, what's your age now?

744
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,125
Why do you need that now, sir?

745
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,917
Nothing, bro.

746
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,417
I watched a Hollywood movie.

747
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:29,625
I think the name is
Benjamin Mutton or Button.

748
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:32,125
The male lead looks like
an old man when he was born.

749
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:33,750
As he grows up, he turns young.

750
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:34,750
At the age of 60...

751
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,833
Why are you telling me now?

752
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:38,750
There's a reason.

753
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:40,292
You know the deceased old man.

754
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,542
In the photo, there is a man
who looks like you.

755
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:45,083
Similar to that movie...

756
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:47,417
You were in that old man's picture.

757
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,375
You're now doing all this stuff at the age
of 60, disguised as a young man.

758
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:53,583
You're rambling on like an insane person.

759
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:55,000
Insane?

760
01:07:55,792 --> 01:07:57,167
Anyone would turn insane
once he hears your story.

761
01:07:57,292 --> 01:07:59,167
Sir, please help me.

762
01:07:59,917 --> 01:08:02,750
If we get hold of those three girls
first, we'll know what happened actually.

763
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,875
That's right.

764
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:12,000
<i>-Cops are at our office, sir.</i>
-Cops?

765
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,750
-At our office?
-Sir, give me the phone!

766
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:15,167
What are you doing?

767
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,708
The cops will trace us and catch us.

768
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,083
Us? Why will they catch me?

769
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:19,583
-Come, sir.
-Jayakanth! I'm a journalist!

770
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:20,625
Bro!

771
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:29,125
Huh?

772
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:32,250
All the three girls are missing, sir!

773
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:41,250
<i>He denied knowing those three girls</i>
<i>even though we thrashed him...</i>

774
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:45,875
<i>But now, he is chanting your name</i>
<i>even though you shot him...</i>

775
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:56,833
Greetings, Priya Ma'am.

776
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:58,667
Karthik sent me.

777
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:01,917
Karthik has nothing to do with
what happened here.

778
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,417
Please stop thinking about it.

779
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,583
-Please come with me.
-Okay.

780
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:22,958
A girl has jumped over the wall.

781
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:26,375
Another girl now? I can't move. You go.

782
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,083
Sir, it's Ramya! She's leaving!

783
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,500
Please hurry, sir.

784
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:31,042
Yuck! The bird pooped on me.

785
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,542
-Enough wiping! Come on!
-Again!

786
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:34,708
Start this piece of crap!

787
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,625
She is leaving! Hurry, sir!

788
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,083
-Move now.
-We are lucky!

789
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:39,083
It started at one go!

790
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:48,542
Huh?

791
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,375
Awesome, sir!

792
01:09:56,292 --> 01:10:00,750
If the cops find this,
they'll know we planned it all.

793
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:05,500
The footage is safe, guys.

794
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:07,583
We just need to hide ourselves now.

795
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:12,500
The cops think Karthik would've
kidnapped us and harmed us.

796
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,917
Karthik anyhow doesn't
know our whereabouts.

797
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:18,208
So, they'll kill him
and close the case.

798
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,667
How is it, guys?

799
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,333
-Come along, sir.
-Yeah.

800
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:33,417
Now I have all your details.

801
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
It's in my hands.
The Journalist Jayakanth!

802
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:38,750
Let's see who is going to kill who now.

803
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,292
Hmm?

804
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:49,333
-Hey!
-Let go!

805
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:51,375
-Give me the camera!
-No, I won't!

806
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:56,917
-Hey! Sit there!
-Give it to me!

807
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,292
So you can talk?

808
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:02,625
Sit there! Sit!

809
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:05,583
Sit!

810
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:09,958
Who the hell are all of you?

811
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:11,292
Why are you doing this?

812
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:13,000
Tell me! Come on!

813
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:17,000
-Sit down.
-Where's Karthik?

814
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:18,958
He'll come.

815
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:21,625
I'll get him.

816
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,625
Sarasvathamma? She's...

817
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,833
Sarasvathamma? Why are you here?

818
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:39,792
-Where's Karthik?
-Don't worry.

819
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:43,083
-You seem so weak. Sit down.
-Let me...

820
01:11:43,792 --> 01:11:47,417
-Sit down. Take this. Have it.
-Karthik...

821
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:51,583
Have it. Yeah, that's it.

822
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:57,458
I don't understand what happened.

823
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,708
Did you see Karthik?

824
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:09,000
Don't be angry.

825
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:11,167
There's nothing to worry about.

826
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,375
Karthik is a very good man.

827
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:17,708
There's an important reason behind
what's happening right now.

828
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,250
What are you talking about?

829
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,708
I don't understand.

830
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,708
I'll tell you what really happened.

831
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:35,458
<i>Every girl dreams about</i>
<i>her prince charming.</i>

832
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:38,917
<i>One day, that prince</i>
<i>charming came to our village.</i>

833
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,125
<i>He's Krishna Murthy.</i>

834
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:45,250
<i>Sarasvathi would wait for 365 days</i>
<i>until that festival.</i>

835
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:48,542
<i>But on that day,</i>
<i>she looks only at Krishna Murthy</i>

836
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:50,583
<i>and she'd forget her own self.</i>

837
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:54,250
<i>She's not just in love with him.</i>
<i>She's mad about him.</i>

838
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:57,958
<i>In a magic called Krishna Murthy...</i>

839
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,917
<i>She used to live so happily in her dreams.</i>

840
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:05,292
Soldiers,
for this history to remember us,

841
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,167
we need victory.
Let's crush the enemy.

842
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:10,833
Sound the war bugle.

843
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:37,167
Bhanumathi.

844
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:41,250
Dear, you are fine, right?

845
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,208
What? This entire world is
at this Vikramarka's feet.

846
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:48,375
And I am at your feet.

847
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:52,083
Dear, as a gift for your bravery...

848
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:54,875
-Shall I give you a kiss?
-Damn...

849
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:57,625
-I don't like this.
-What happened?

850
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,125
-I am talking to you.
-He's too much into it.

851
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:03,500
-That's just an act.
-So what?

852
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:06,083
I'll kill her.

853
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:10,792
<i>No. I didn't like</i>
<i>what Krishna Murthy did today.</i>

854
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:13,375
<i>I should be with him. Not her.</i>

855
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:16,333
<i>If I keep twiddling my thumbs,</i>
<i>I can never get him.</i>

856
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:25,292
<i>Dear, Sarasvathi...</i>

857
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:28,625
<i>Yours, Krishna Murthy. With love...</i>

858
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,917
<i>It's been so long since we met.</i>

859
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:34,292
<i>I came to your village only for you.</i>

860
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:38,125
<i>Let's meet secretly</i>
<i>at the temple this evening.</i>

861
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:42,417
<i>Yours, Krishna Murthy.</i>

862
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:46,375
<i>I wrote myself a letter</i>
<i>as if Krishna Murthy wrote it.</i>

863
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:48,500
<i>I mailed it to my address.</i>

864
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:52,958
<i>It will be really great</i>
<i>if he writes me a letter like this!</i>

865
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,250
<i>He's coming. He's here...</i>

866
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,250
<i>He'll call me.</i>

867
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:01,625
Sarasvathamma...

868
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,375
-How are you?
-I am good.

869
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:10,708
-There's a letter for you.
-Letter for me? From whom?

870
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:14,250
-It says Krishna Murthy.
-Krishna...

871
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:15,833
Can you read it once?

872
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:19,125
Dear, Sarasvathi...

873
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,833
Yours Krishna Murthy. With love...

874
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:22,375
It's been so long since...

875
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:27,750
-That's okay. Don't tell anyone.
-Ok.

876
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:33,208
That landlord's daughter Sarasvathi
and actor Krishna Murthy...

877
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:34,708
They are in love.

878
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:38,542
Is it? They are in love?

879
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,625
They are in love...
It seems they are in love.

880
01:15:52,792 --> 01:15:55,042
<i>I feel very happy today.</i>

881
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:57,417
<i>Everyone thinks we are lovers.</i>

882
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:00,833
<i>Maybe it will all come true someday...</i>

883
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:04,458
<i>What if my dream comes true</i>
<i>and Krishna Murthy comes to me now?</i>

884
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:06,500
<i>How lucky I would be...</i>

885
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,250
<i>Don't kill me like that</i>
<i>With the sharp edge of your mustache</i>

886
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:33,000
<i>Don't gawk at me like that</i>
<i>With your sensuous eyes</i>

887
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:38,583
<i>No one will approve of our love</i>
<i>So, don't turn me on now</i>

888
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:43,625
<i>The entire village</i>
<i>Will be filled with chaos</i>

889
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:50,500
<i>I am flying high</i>
<i>Under your spell</i>

890
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:55,750
<i>And when we hug</i>
<i>No one can ever drive us apart</i>

891
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:59,917
<i>I'll stick to you like a tattoo</i>

892
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,292
<i>For this life, I'll keep you in my heart</i>
<i>And will take good care of you</i>

893
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:07,333
<i>You will adorn my forehead with vermilion</i>

894
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,958
<i>I am giving you my heart</i>

895
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:17,958
<i>Don't kill me like that</i>
<i>With the sharp edge of your mustache</i>

896
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:23,708
<i>Don't gawk at me like that</i>
<i>With your sensuous eyes</i>

897
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,333
<i>My mouth turned red</i>
<i>When I chew betel leaf and betel nut</i>

898
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:57,333
<i>My lips turned red like the rising sun</i>

899
01:17:57,583 --> 01:18:00,375
<i>Let's flap wings and fly away</i>

900
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:03,250
<i>Let's turn into jasmines and wither away</i>

901
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:06,167
<i>Let's take a rebirth today</i>

902
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:09,542
<i>You hid deep in my heart</i>

903
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:14,292
<i>I am a cotton thread</i>
<i>But you turned me into a wick</i>

904
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:20,500
<i>I'll treat you like</i>
<i>My personal lantern</i>

905
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:24,625
<i>I'll stick to you like a tattoo</i>

906
01:18:24,708 --> 01:18:28,917
<i>Whenever I look at you</i>
<i>I want to hide you deep in my heart</i>

907
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,167
<i>You will adorn my forehead with vermilion</i>
<i>I promise you with all my heart</i>

908
01:18:57,375 --> 01:19:02,792
<i>The cold breeze played around</i>

909
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:08,125
<i>All the crazy hopes are because of you</i>

910
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:11,000
I'd love to convert you
Into a bangle for myself

911
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,792
<i>I want to wear you like an ornament</i>

912
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:16,958
<i>This girl is awesome!</i>

913
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:20,042
<i>Look carefully, you are totally over me</i>

914
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:24,583
<i>You are an auspicious mark</i>
<i>On a beautiful doll</i>

915
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:31,417
<i>Turn into moonlight in</i>
<i>Which I can play like a kid</i>

916
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,417
<i>I'll stick to you like a tattoo</i>

917
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,625
<i>For this life I'll keep you in my heart</i>
<i>And will take good care of you</i>

918
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,708
-<i>You will adorn my forehead with vermilion</i>
-Krishna Murthy?

919
01:19:42,792 --> 01:19:45,125
-<i>I am giving you my heart</i>
-Hey Krishna Murthy?

920
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:49,000
Where is he?

921
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:52,458
Sarasvathi, what are you doing here?

922
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:54,875
Why is she feeling shy?

923
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:57,583
-Nothing...
-What? Wow!

924
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,000
Dear Krishna?

925
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:01,917
There is another drama
being played behind the screen!

926
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:02,917
Stop it, man!

927
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,333
-Oh!
-I'll tell you when the time comes.

928
01:20:04,417 --> 01:20:06,125
Is it?

929
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:08,208
I've come at the right time!

930
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:13,125
<i>All my dreams might just die.</i>

931
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,250
<i>I hate to see</i>
<i>Bhanu and Krishna Murthy together.</i>

932
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:18,458
<i>I won't spare her.</i>

933
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:27,875
-Do you know where we are going?
-To meet the landlord.

934
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,375
No, Uncle.
He's going to be our relative now.

935
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:33,875
What are you talking about?

936
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,958
Yes, it's true.

937
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:41,042
Do you know that Krishna Murthy
and Sarasvathi are in love?

938
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,333
-Did you know it already?
-Hey...

939
01:20:44,542 --> 01:20:45,750
What are you saying?

940
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:49,125
I saw them together many times.

941
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:52,625
We are just living our lives.

942
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,250
Don't spoil it for us, please.

943
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:57,625
Your son can feed the entire village...

944
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,625
Why are you still being so humble?
Come on.

945
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,583
There is Sarasvathi, your daughter-in-law.
Take a look.

946
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:10,458
-Shut up.
-Look! She is happy to see us here.

947
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:15,000
-Hello.
-Hello... Look at her excitement.

948
01:21:15,917 --> 01:21:17,917
-We are very lucky, uncle.
-Please sit there.

949
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,125
Okay, sir.

950
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,750
-Come. Please have a seat.
-Okay.

951
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:27,750
Isn't Krishna Murthy here?

952
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,833
-He's...
-He had some important work to do.

953
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:35,417
God, I almost forgot...
I'll be back in a moment.

954
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:38,833
Look at her enquire about Krishna Murthy
with so much love.

955
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:40,875
Their marriage just got fixed.

956
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:43,500
Please have it.

957
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:48,542
-Wow, a silver glass!
-Shut up and drink.

958
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:52,708
-Hello, sir.
-Hello...

959
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,708
-Hello, sir.
-Hello. Take your seat.

960
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,708
-The acts went very well this year.
-Thank God.

961
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:07,292
Your son Krishna Murthy acted so well.

962
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:12,333
-My daughter keeps on talking about them.
-I am glad to hear that, sir.

963
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:15,333
What do you plan to do next?

964
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:20,042
What else, sir. I am growing old.

965
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:23,958
I'll be free of my duty
if I can get my son married.

966
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:27,750
Then what are you waiting for?
Find a nice girl and get them married.

967
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:31,667
We've found a nice girl already.
If her parents agree,

968
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:33,458
-we can get them married.
-Hey...

969
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,708
Sir...

970
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:39,542
We just thought about it
and they are all set for an engagement.

971
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,833
Shut up.

972
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,667
Everything will go well, Sundaram.

973
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:46,000
-Take it.
-It's just your big heart.

974
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:54,000
Dad? What are you doing here?

975
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,750
What are you doing?

976
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:01,708
The villagers will spit on me
if they come to know this.

977
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:05,708
You are circulating this rumor yourself?

978
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,250
Do you know what our status is?

979
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,958
He's like a dog of our compound.

980
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:14,167
-And you are in...
-Dad, please don't get angry.

981
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:18,833
I like him a lot.
He's a very good guy.

982
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,458
Please don't separate us.

983
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,292
We love each other a lot.

984
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,167
Are you mad?
Do you know what you are doing?

985
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:32,708
-Dad, please...
-Do I need to pay for what you did?

986
01:23:32,792 --> 01:23:35,167
-Please don't separate us.
-I am ashamed to be your father.

987
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:38,333
You can't get him till I am alive.

988
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:41,542
I am talking to you.
Let go of my legs and get up.

989
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:44,042
Let go! What are you thinking?

990
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:47,500
Even if you beg me... Even if I die...
I don't agree with this.

991
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:50,292
Then die...

992
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:05,125
Oh, God! Dad...

993
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:13,292
Dad!

994
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:17,417
-Dad!
-Madam, what happened to him?

995
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:21,042
He was talking to me
and he suddenly slipped.

996
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:22,625
Dad...

997
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:47,125
You should control yourself.

998
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:51,333
No one can help your pain.

999
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:56,500
We are here for you.
I know that you and my son are in love.

1000
01:24:56,917 --> 01:25:00,000
That's why I want you
to get married to my son.

1001
01:25:02,542 --> 01:25:05,167
We'll always have his blessings.

1002
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:09,708
I'll talk to my son and start
preparing for the marriage.

1003
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:16,042
<i>Whatever happened has happened.</i>

1004
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:18,083
Venu told him everything.

1005
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,708
I know everything. Poor girl!

1006
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:24,792
You are going to get engaged in two days.

1007
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:27,750
We'll take care of everything.

1008
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,583
Don't leave the village until then.

1009
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,125
What else then?
Let's start preparing for the marriage.

1010
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:55,792
-Venu, smear this holy powder.
-Okay, uncle.

1011
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:57,958
A little high.

1012
01:25:59,167 --> 01:26:00,708
-That's it.
-Looks good.

1013
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:03,583
It's time. Get the bride.

1014
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:18,875
Look at your Krishna Murthy.

1015
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,375
Hey, who's this girl?

1016
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:24,792
What are you saying, Krishna?
She's our Sarasvathi.

1017
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,917
Our Sarasvathi?
I've never seen this girl before.

1018
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:33,417
Dad, who's this?
This is not the girl I love.

1019
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,625
Hey, what are you saying?

1020
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:38,125
The entire village knows
that you love her.

1021
01:26:38,208 --> 01:26:39,958
Dad, what are you talking about?

1022
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:42,333
Hey, Venu. What is he talking about?

1023
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:45,833
Hey, Krishna,
I saw you both roam around together.

1024
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,333
-Hey...
-Yes, he's right. They are in love.

1025
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:53,792
Hey, you're so lucky
that she's in love with you.

1026
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:57,083
But now you insult her
in front of the villagers?

1027
01:26:57,167 --> 01:26:59,000
You cheap dog.

1028
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:03,542
-What? Is this a new drama?
-Wait...

1029
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:05,417
Don't fight. Let me talk.

1030
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,583
Madam, we're keeping calm only for you.

1031
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:10,292
Or else we would have killed him.

1032
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,125
Why are you talking like this
in front of them, Krishna Murthy?

1033
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:16,792
You loved me. You promised
to stay by my side for a lifetime.

1034
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:21,042
Now you ask who I am?

1035
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,917
God! Where should I go? What should I do?

1036
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:27,667
Who will save me?

1037
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,500
Madam, don't cry. We are here for you.

1038
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:35,000
Hey, are you acting?

1039
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,917
Do you think she's alone? Marry her!

1040
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:43,792
Yes, he should marry her now.

1041
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:48,833
-Marry her!
-One minute.

1042
01:27:49,042 --> 01:27:51,375
You believe that
she's telling the truth, right?

1043
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:54,458
Ask her to swear upon the Goddess
and say the same.

1044
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:56,208
Then I'll marry her.

1045
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:01,208
What are you thinking?
Bring the holy fire.

1046
01:28:51,167 --> 01:28:52,208
Drink this.

1047
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,417
Get lost.

1048
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:04,208
Are you still angry with me?

1049
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,417
Please don't think about what happened.

1050
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,625
Today is our first night.

1051
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:15,167
See... Do you like this saree?

1052
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,583
I wore it as you like this color.

1053
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:22,500
I almost forget.
I should take your blessings first.

1054
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:24,083
Bless me.

1055
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:38,625
Hey... Who are you talking to?

1056
01:29:47,042 --> 01:29:49,417
Why? It's you I am talking to.

1057
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:52,083
-What happened to you?
-I saw everything.

1058
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,833
You were talking to yourself,
as if you are mad.

1059
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:01,292
Yes, I am mad.

1060
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:05,208
I am mad about you and your dramas.

1061
01:30:05,542 --> 01:30:08,375
I am mad about meeting you
and you looking at me.

1062
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:11,667
-Yes, I am mad. I am mad about...
-Stop acting.

1063
01:30:11,917 --> 01:30:14,708
You made a fool of me in front
of the villagers and got married.

1064
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:18,292
I'll prove all of them that you are mad.

1065
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,417
-Please listen to me. I...
-Hey...

1066
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:25,042
Hey! Listen to me!

1067
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:28,208
I killed my own father for you!

1068
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:30,125
Then die...

1069
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:38,458
I lived every moment thinking about you.

1070
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:53,250
That Bhanu you loved...

1071
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:57,417
I thought of killing her
and her entire family.

1072
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:08,417
But she escaped...

1073
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:14,542
I did all of this... Only to win you.

1074
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:18,000
Hey... You are this evil?

1075
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:21,417
-I'll expose you to the village.
-God... No.

1076
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:24,583
Hey, Suri Babu. Hey, Venkanna...

1077
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:26,708
You didn't listen to me, Dad.

1078
01:31:26,917 --> 01:31:28,542
Come... Come on.

1079
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:32,542
What happened, sir?

1080
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:36,583
You believed this mad girl
and got me married to her.

1081
01:31:36,667 --> 01:31:40,208
She's really mad. Don't believe her.

1082
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:44,417
That day you said you didn't know her.
Now you call her mad?

1083
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:47,958
-Madam, what happened?
-Why are you doing this to me?

1084
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:50,042
-I am your wife...
-God!

1085
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:54,583
Don't believe her.
Not just me, she's cheating you all too.

1086
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:57,750
This mad girl killed her own father.

1087
01:31:57,958 --> 01:32:02,042
God! You are calling me
a murderer and a mad girl...

1088
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,375
Why are you talking like this?

1089
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,125
-Hey...
-How dare you?

1090
01:32:07,292 --> 01:32:09,208
-Did you hit her?
-Listen to me.

1091
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:10,917
Beat him up! Come on...

1092
01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:13,583
-Beat him up!
-Listen to me!

1093
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,125
-Hey...
-No...

1094
01:32:15,208 --> 01:32:17,375
-Hey...
-Wait. Step back.

1095
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:18,750
Move...

1096
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:22,792
You won't believe me, right?

1097
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:25,875
-Right?
-Hey, catch him. He's getting away.

1098
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:27,833
-Don't hurt him.
-Don't let him go.

1099
01:32:28,083 --> 01:32:29,458
-Get him.
-Uncle...

1100
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:33,875
-He looks like Krishna Murthy.
-Let's go.

1101
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:47,500
-There he is.
-Krishna? Krishna...

1102
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,500
You have no other option.

1103
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:21,750
You have to live with me.

1104
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:31,917
-He's about to jump.
-No...

1105
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:34,667
Krishna Murthy...

1106
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,583
Someone save him.

1107
01:33:49,667 --> 01:33:50,500
-Sir.
-What?

1108
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:53,500
-We searched everywhere. No sign of him.
-What?

1109
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:55,000
I think he's dead.

1110
01:33:57,792 --> 01:34:00,042
God! Murthy...

1111
01:34:04,708 --> 01:34:06,250
-Uncle...
-Huh?

1112
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:07,750
Where were you all this time?

1113
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:09,458
He's waiting for us. Come let's eat.

1114
01:34:12,667 --> 01:34:15,333
What's this?
I said I'd bring it, didn't I?

1115
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:19,917
I prepared it especially for you. Have it.

1116
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:29,500
Uncle. Come sit. Let's eat.

1117
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,917
I'll wash my hands and come.

1118
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,500
Uncle...

1119
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,625
Hey... pained by my son's death,

1120
01:34:47,125 --> 01:34:49,417
my daughter-in-law has gone mad.

1121
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:53,292
Be strong for a few days.
Everything will settle down.

1122
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:55,083
Please, be strong.

1123
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:14,667
Sarasvathi!

1124
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:18,625
Shh... Don't you see he is sleeping?

1125
01:35:23,792 --> 01:35:26,000
What are you doing?
No one's there.

1126
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,792
Are you mad? Krishna Murthy is dead!

1127
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:42,292
You called me mad. I took it.

1128
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:45,917
But you said my Krishna Murthy is dead!

1129
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:56,083
I am not mad! You all are mad!

1130
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,375
Die...

1131
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,125
Krishna Murthy...

1132
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:08,500
Let go...

1133
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:17,083
GOVERNMENT MENTAL HOSPITAL

1134
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,125
MENTAL HOSPITAL

1135
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:25,333
Sarasvathamma?

1136
01:36:27,792 --> 01:36:29,917
You can go now.
Here is your luggage.

1137
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,917
Madam, how are you?

1138
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:11,958
Why are you here?

1139
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,750
Let's go to our village.

1140
01:37:15,792 --> 01:37:18,125
No, brother. I'll stay here.

1141
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,917
It's peaceful here.

1142
01:37:23,167 --> 01:37:25,750
Krishna Murthy... Stop.

1143
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:28,500
Hey... Stop Krishna Murthy.

1144
01:38:58,583 --> 01:39:01,375
Krishna Murthy!

1145
01:39:08,167 --> 01:39:09,792
Why did you do this?

1146
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:12,625
You should have stayed
with me and avoided this.

1147
01:39:15,792 --> 01:39:20,208
You made me kill you with my own hands.

1148
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:50,917
I killed them.

1149
01:39:51,667 --> 01:39:53,958
I killed Krishna Murthy's entire family.

1150
01:39:55,708 --> 01:39:57,292
I thought the story ended.

1151
01:39:57,833 --> 01:39:58,708
<i>But...</i>

1152
01:39:59,417 --> 01:40:00,875
<i>After a few years,</i>

1153
01:40:01,667 --> 01:40:04,625
<i>I saw my Krishna Murthy at your wedding.</i>

1154
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,792
Krishna Murthy!

1155
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,667
-Who's Krishna Murthy?
-The boy you married.

1156
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:12,792
-He's my Krishna Murthy.
-No. He's my Karthik.

1157
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:14,583
Hey, sit down!

1158
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,250
I said, sit.

1159
01:40:21,958 --> 01:40:23,750
He might be Karthik for you.

1160
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,042
But he's my Krishna Murthy.

1161
01:40:26,542 --> 01:40:29,292
<i>Why does Krishna Murthy</i>
<i>still look the same?</i>

1162
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,667
<i>But I have gotten old.</i>

1163
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:36,708
<i>My face is wrinkled</i>
<i>and I lost my beauty.</i>

1164
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:39,042
<i>I began to hate myself...</i>

1165
01:40:40,958 --> 01:40:44,542
<i>I started enquiring about</i>
<i>Krishna Murthy from that day on.</i>

1166
01:40:44,917 --> 01:40:46,958
<i>I once lived like a queen.</i>

1167
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:51,375
<i>And now I was working as a maid for you.</i>

1168
01:40:53,125 --> 01:40:56,042
<i>One day, I got to look</i>
<i>at his family picture.</i>

1169
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,958
I thought I destroyed
Krishna Murthy completely.

1170
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:06,292
But...

1171
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:12,375
But he came back and was spending
a very happy life with you.

1172
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:18,208
Seeing all that...
I decided to kill him at any cost.

1173
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:21,875
But... But I am old...

1174
01:41:24,583 --> 01:41:27,375
What can I do at this age?

1175
01:41:28,292 --> 01:41:30,708
Then... Right then...

1176
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:33,458
I got lucky.

1177
01:41:37,083 --> 01:41:39,292
You spoiled my entire life.

1178
01:41:40,667 --> 01:41:43,542
-Karthik!
-Who are you all? Where's that old lady?

1179
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:46,542
Tell me!

1180
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:58,792
I have nothing to do with this case.
These three girls did all this.

1181
01:41:58,917 --> 01:42:00,917
What I am saying is true.
Believe me.

1182
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:06,125
Also, it's our maid
who made them do all this.

1183
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:08,417
What I am saying is true.
Believe me.

1184
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:11,958
-Jayakanth?
-Sir.

1185
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:13,583
Is this true?

1186
01:42:13,667 --> 01:42:15,708
Yes, sir. He had nothing to do with this.

1187
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:17,333
-Sir, come on.
-Let's go.

1188
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:21,333
I have sent you the location.
Okay, sir.

1189
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:27,458
All the related details
are in this camera.

1190
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,167
Tell me the truth. What happened?

1191
01:42:38,083 --> 01:42:42,667
<i>One night, when we were</i>
<i>going home from a party...</i>

1192
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:46,583
<i>Suddenly a gang of men</i>
<i>attempted to rape us.</i>

1193
01:42:47,292 --> 01:42:51,042
<i>Sarasvathamma saved us from them.</i>

1194
01:42:51,917 --> 01:42:54,917
<i>She did not just save us,</i>
<i>but she took us with her,</i>

1195
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,542
<i>got us treated and took care of us.</i>

1196
01:42:58,375 --> 01:42:59,625
Why are you living here?

1197
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,875
Do you need any help?
Please tell us.

1198
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,583
You can't do it even if I ask.

1199
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:09,417
What's this? You helped us a lot.

1200
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,042
How can we pay you back?

1201
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:13,500
Ask us what you want.
We are here for you.

1202
01:43:13,917 --> 01:43:15,417
Kill a man...

1203
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,375
You should kill a man! Can you?

1204
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:22,417
I used to have a daughter just like you.

1205
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:25,042
A guy...

1206
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:28,958
cheated her in the name of marriage...

1207
01:43:29,667 --> 01:43:31,333
and spoiled her life.

1208
01:43:31,417 --> 01:43:33,750
But he's very happy now.

1209
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:42,083
Ma'am, don't get excited.

1210
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:44,167
Think with a still mind.

1211
01:43:44,917 --> 01:43:46,875
I can understand your pain.

1212
01:43:48,583 --> 01:43:50,792
If we kill him as you said,

1213
01:43:51,042 --> 01:43:52,625
it will give you nothing.

1214
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:57,167
He will go through hell
until the day he dies.

1215
01:43:58,375 --> 01:43:59,833
We'll take care of that.

1216
01:44:02,833 --> 01:44:06,708
<i>We three started to follow Karthik.</i>

1217
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:09,875
<i>Created fake profiles and numbers.</i>

1218
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:14,708
<i>We joined his office</i>
<i>even without his knowledge.</i>

1219
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:20,750
<i>We got all the staff believe</i>
<i>that he was in love with us.</i>

1220
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:52,000
<i>As Sarasvathamma told us to,</i>

1221
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:57,667
<i>we turned Karthik and Priya's love story</i>
<i>into ours. That too with evidence.</i>

1222
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:00,792
<i>We filed a missing complaint</i>
<i>at the police station.</i>

1223
01:45:03,583 --> 01:45:06,083
Time and situation
won't come to you on their own.

1224
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:07,792
<i>We need to make them come to us.</i>

1225
01:45:21,042 --> 01:45:26,000
It was me who staged the attack
on those three girls.

1226
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:32,500
Without knowing that,
they just listened to me.

1227
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:38,125
He's trying so hard to save your life.

1228
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:43,167
More than that,
I am waiting to take his life.

1229
01:45:48,792 --> 01:45:51,542
Up to my knowledge, by now...

1230
01:45:52,125 --> 01:45:54,125
those girls might have learned about me.

1231
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,333
Give me the phone.

1232
01:46:07,583 --> 01:46:09,000
Give it to me!

1233
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:19,500
-So you knew everything?
-Once I catch you...

1234
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:21,792
I'll kill you with my own hands.

1235
01:46:22,792 --> 01:46:23,958
Really?

1236
01:46:26,125 --> 01:46:28,792
If you want Priya alive,

1237
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,458
come here and meet me.

1238
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:36,958
Hey, What do you mean?
Where's Priya?

1239
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:39,833
<i>-What happened to her?</i>
-Priya... Priya...

1240
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:43,250
Talk... Talk to him.

1241
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:53,375
I misunderstood you...
A lot of things happened in my life.

1242
01:46:54,167 --> 01:46:56,292
I made a mistake. Forgive me.

1243
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,792
I am scared.

1244
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:03,208
I don't know how long I will be alive.

1245
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,000
-Priya...
-But before I die...

1246
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:09,125
I want to see you just once.

1247
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:11,667
Give me the phone. Hey...

1248
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:15,000
Wasn't killing my family enough for you?
Now you are killing Priya too?

1249
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:18,667
It's me who you want, right?
I'll come to you. Let Priya go.

1250
01:47:18,792 --> 01:47:20,917
Hey... Come fast.

1251
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:23,958
Or your wife will die.

1252
01:48:30,167 --> 01:48:31,542
Priya?

1253
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:19,500
Come, Krishna Murthy,
You are finally here.

1254
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:23,167
It seems ages since I saw you last.

1255
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:27,833
Do you remember this saree?

1256
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:33,042
I wore this on our first night.

1257
01:49:33,417 --> 01:49:36,167
Are you mad?
Why are you talking nonsense?

1258
01:49:36,375 --> 01:49:37,333
Where is Priya?

1259
01:49:37,542 --> 01:49:39,250
Now that I am here, let her go.

1260
01:49:39,833 --> 01:49:42,417
Instead of calling out my name,

1261
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:44,708
you called out her name. Why?

1262
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,458
Who's Priya, Krishna Murthy?

1263
01:49:48,333 --> 01:49:52,333
I thought you are my life.
And all these years...

1264
01:49:53,042 --> 01:49:55,333
I lived with your memories, right?

1265
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,833
Can't you see me here?

1266
01:50:01,542 --> 01:50:05,750
When you left me that day,
I begged you not to.

1267
01:50:06,917 --> 01:50:09,333
You didn't understand me, even a little.

1268
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:13,250
I left everything for you.

1269
01:50:14,125 --> 01:50:17,708
Now you're roaming with some other girl
right in front of my eyes!

1270
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:21,625
After seeing all that...

1271
01:50:22,542 --> 01:50:24,708
I thought of killing you all.

1272
01:50:25,875 --> 01:50:27,667
I thought you are my life.

1273
01:50:28,458 --> 01:50:30,708
But you think she's your life.

1274
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:33,042
That's why I brought her here.

1275
01:50:33,792 --> 01:50:35,542
Now you came searching for her.

1276
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:38,333
How many more people
should I kill for you?

1277
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:42,083
If she's really that important to you,

1278
01:50:43,042 --> 01:50:44,167
die for her.

1279
01:50:45,208 --> 01:50:48,042
What are you looking at?
Die for her.

1280
01:50:48,792 --> 01:50:50,833
Or Priya will die
in the next five minutes.

1281
01:51:01,042 --> 01:51:03,417
Where is she? Tell me.

1282
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,958
Sir, forgive me.

1283
01:51:07,042 --> 01:51:08,958
I am a poor old woman.

1284
01:51:09,208 --> 01:51:13,500
I made an innocent mistake.
I'll tell you where Priya is.

1285
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:15,958
Please... I'll tell you.

1286
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:22,417
-No... Hey.
-Hey...

1287
01:51:27,875 --> 01:51:28,875
Move back.

1288
01:51:30,542 --> 01:51:32,542
Hey, Krishna Murthy. Die.

1289
01:51:32,792 --> 01:51:34,167
Or I'll kill you.

1290
01:51:34,375 --> 01:51:37,375
Why are you talking like a psycho?
I am not Krishna Murthy. It was my father.

1291
01:51:37,542 --> 01:51:40,000
Even now you don't understand me, do you?

1292
01:51:40,958 --> 01:51:42,958
-Die...
-Karthik.

1293
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,583
Hey, no. Don't shoot her.

1294
01:51:49,458 --> 01:51:52,292
Krishna Murthy. I won't leave you.

1295
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:56,458
Sarasvathi?

1296
01:51:58,958 --> 01:52:01,792
It's me. Krishna Murthy.

1297
01:52:03,042 --> 01:52:05,167
Now that I am here, let Priya go.

1298
01:52:12,167 --> 01:52:15,375
You are talking like that
because you want her, don't you?

1299
01:52:15,917 --> 01:52:17,208
It's nothing like that.

1300
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:25,750
Even when you left me...

1301
01:52:26,833 --> 01:52:29,500
your words carried truth.

1302
01:52:29,875 --> 01:52:31,708
But now...

1303
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:41,833
You knew everything about me, didn't you?

1304
01:52:44,833 --> 01:52:48,083
Hey... Do you think this is all over?

1305
01:52:48,833 --> 01:52:50,667
You won't live peacefully.

1306
01:52:51,833 --> 01:52:53,917
Save your wife if you can.

1307
01:52:55,625 --> 01:52:57,125
Hey... No!

1308
01:55:52,542 --> 01:55:55,208
