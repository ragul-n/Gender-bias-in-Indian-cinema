1
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:50,575
Oh, god! I've to wash the utensils,
wash the clothes,

2
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:52,908
More works to do.

3
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,741
Hey, why are you throwing the daily?

4
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,950
I'm distributing the daily
in every household.

5
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,616
It's good to see a beautiful woman
in the morning, But, I've to see you.

6
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,658
That's why I've thrown it.

7
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:16,908
Are you expecting an actress
to please you?

8
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:18,408
Get lost.

9
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,825
Okay. at least change the pattern.

10
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,324
Get lost!

11
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:39,116
His name is Chinna Thambi.

12
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:41,157
Everyone has heard of 'housewife'.

13
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:44,116
But, he and his father-in-law are
'house husband'.

14
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,074
Are you wondering, as it sounds new?

15
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:52,199
From morning till night,
they do so much work.

16
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,491
To escape from these house hold works,

17
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:59,366
He is searching for a job with the certificate
he got from his partial studies.

18
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,533
To that extent, he is tortured by
his wife and mother-in-law.

19
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,741
Did the leg slip on me, unknowingly?

20
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,366
No need to ask sorry.
Leave it.

21
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,992
Hey, not at all.
I hit you wantedly.

22
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:10,283
You're snoring, still.
Get up.

23
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,324
Okay, don't be enraged.
I'll go.

24
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:14,575
Sir, I'll rectify the issues on my own.

25
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:17,199
Believe me, sir.
It never happened earlier.

26
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,199
Only now, It's happening like this.

27
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:24,283
All the guys are new.

28
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:26,157
They're doing like this.

29
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,866
Your mom didn't allow me to grind
the chutney.

30
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,658
That too, the coconut chutney.

31
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:31,241
Sir, no problem in the
International process

32
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,074
Hey, you like only tomato chutney, isn't it?
-Yes.

33
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,116
Your wife is not letting me to do it.

34
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,866
Sir, the domestic process is
highly problematic.

35
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,533
I'll speak to you later,
just five minutes.

36
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:39,866
Mom, you know it's time to go to office.

37
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:41,491
You'd have made any two types of chutney.

38
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,449
It's not possible to do two chutneys,
everyday.

39
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,700
Tell your wife not to get into the kitchen.

40
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,825
I'll take care of everything.

41
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,449
Why shouldn't I get into the kitchen?

42
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:49,408
Tell her not to come.

43
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:49,992
I'll take care.

44
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:50,992
Enough.

45
00:09:50,992 --> 00:09:53,449
First, clean the utensils.
Then, you can do cooking.

46
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:56,116
I can't do it.
If you want, you do it.

47
00:09:56,116 --> 00:09:58,033
See, how is she speaking!

48
00:09:58,491 --> 00:09:59,199
Hey!

49
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:00,950
Drink this.

50
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,283
Have this.
-Wait, have this.

51
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:07,616
Take this.
-Take this.

52
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:09,366
He spoke about me, isn't it?

53
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:10,533
He is Singh.

54
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:13,074
Not a North-Indian.

55
00:10:13,074 --> 00:10:14,533
He works in an IT company.

56
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:18,366
So, he changed his name 'Singara velan'
as 'Singh'.

57
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:21,992
Though he is presentable to job,

58
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:25,908
It's miserable for him in house amidst
his wife and mom.

59
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,408
Your mom is crossing the boundary.

60
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:30,741
Either one of us should be in this house.

61
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:34,324
You stay along.
I'll go, somewhere.

62
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,199
Mom!

63
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:36,700
Water!

64
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:41,908
Go...it's him!
Shoot him.

65
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:42,992
Go...go...

66
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:44,700
Hey, move away.

67
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,241
Shoot him.
Go...go...

68
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,950
He is Goutham.

69
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:49,575
He is a game addictive.

70
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:56,950
Addicted to the extent of asking for
extra fingers to play PUBG.

71
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,700
Like so many people being a problem for
both of us,

72
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,408
He too has a problematic person.

73
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:04,783
Watch who is that?
-Go...go...

74
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:09,408
Krishna murthy,
something drops in your personality.

75
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:11,825
Go...shoot him.

76
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,491
Okay.

77
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:19,741
Come this side.

78
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:22,116
Hey, it's me.
Don't shoot.

79
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,033
Hey! No!
You shot.

80
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:24,950
Damn it.

81
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,575
Who was shot, my dear son?

82
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,033
Dad, it's in the game.

83
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,241
You too...

84
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:32,283
Didn't you leave, yet?

85
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,992
I've booked a cab for you.
-Cab?

86
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:36,992
Do you know to book a cab?

87
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:38,033
Where are we going?

88
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:41,157
To see a bride.
-To see a bride?

89
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:44,199
We can go later,
First, consult a doctor.

90
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,366
You've nervous disorder, going worse.

91
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:46,741
Don't tease me.

92
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,616
We're going to see bride for you.

93
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:50,116
You know, right!
Going for my sake.

94
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,533
Then, why are you dressed up, pretty?

95
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:56,157
People will come to a conclusion about
the son looking his father.

96
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,324
That's why, I'm dressed up pretty.

97
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:00,741
Oh, will they accept looking you?

98
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:02,866
Damn sure they'll not accept, then.

99
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:03,366
Go away.

100
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:05,199
He too...

101
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:12,366
Are you watching soap operas without even
knowing the cost of groceries?

102
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,366
That's why, we're grinding the flour.

103
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:19,366
Dear, son-in-law wants to attend an interview...
-Hey, leave it.

104
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,241
I'm already tensed about Valli.

105
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,283
Will he be selected if attending the interview?

106
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:25,575
Why uneccesary strain?

107
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,116
Retain him as a help to you.

108
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:28,616
Helpful for me!

109
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:31,825
I'm here as a maid.

110
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:34,366
Is he my assistant?
Okay, will ask him to grind the flour.

111
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,575
No aunt, this time...

112
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:39,116
Mom is saying, right?
Do as she said.

113
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:41,408
How will you get a job by
studying engineering?

114
00:12:41,491 --> 00:12:43,575
No, aunt. Somehow,
I'll get selected this time.

115
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:47,700
Yes, allow him this time...
-Send him.

116
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,992
Come on...

117
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,783
Increase the volume.

118
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:54,950
Mom, why should you leave
the house because of her?

119
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,575
I'll ask her to leave.

120
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,366
Who'll take care of me, then?

121
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:00,533
I'll ensure not to repeat this
sort of problems.

122
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,157
Let it be the last.

123
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,825
It's the last.

124
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,575
If your wife quarrels, later...

125
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:09,074
...I'll not stay in this house.

126
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:10,199
Stayb blessed. Get up.

127
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,366
You've proved there is no greater
power than the mother.

128
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:13,241
Wife!

129
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,491
She saw me!

130
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:15,616
Where are you going?

131
00:13:15,616 --> 00:13:17,741
Will your mother only
knows to go out?

132
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:18,658
I'll also go.

133
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:20,491
Wife, stop.
-Go...

134
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:21,825
Let her go. Leaver her.
-Stop, dear.

135
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:25,700
Dude, what are you playing?

136
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:27,116
Mario?

137
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,866
Mario! It's PubG.

138
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,825
Oh, it's Bajji!

139
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:34,241
I asked to do more.

140
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:37,741
But, I like the savoury.

141
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,783
Be quiet. Why are you saying them
all those?

142
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:43,199
I too like bajji.

143
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,324
Get me four bajjis.

144
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,825
It's not that.
It's 'PubG'.

145
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,116
Ask the bride to come,
we'll move.

146
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:52,033
Dear, bring our daughter.
-Okay.

147
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,575
Send bajji.

148
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:54,783
Will you ask?

149
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:57,491
Send your daughter.

150
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:16,074
Hi!
-Hi!

151
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:17,616
Do you know to play the games?

152
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:18,491
Yeah, I know.

153
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:25,616
Candy crush, temple run,
angry birds etc...

154
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,908
All these were played
in the school.

155
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,783
She doesn't know anything
about the game.

156
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:29,783
Come, let's go, Dad.

157
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:32,033
You might be good in playing games.

158
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:33,825
But, you haven't seen
her playing, right?

159
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:36,825
You'll be surprised
when see her playing.

160
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:38,324
Kanaga!

161
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:40,866
Wait, I'll get changed my attires.

162
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,116
Will you hit?
-Yes.

163
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,533
How dare you hit before me?
Leave me.

164
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:46,241
Move away.

165
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:47,408
Where are you going?

166
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:50,825
What?
-Keep the can down.

167
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:53,199
Break and pour the water.

168
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:57,033
Mom is here for you,
let her go.

169
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:59,825
Quarreling in the street,
don't you feel ashame?

170
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:06,491
Dude, only this heeds to my words
in this house.

171
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:07,616
It too didn't start.

172
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,283
Do one thing.

173
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,866
Think of your wife and mother-in-law
and kick it.

174
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,741
Bend down and see.

175
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,324
To your side, sir.

176
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:18,700
You've the pistol
and these people are thrashing me.

177
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,074
I'll hit you.

178
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:21,033
Are you pranking?

179
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:21,908
Hit him.

180
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,866
Hit him.
-Will you tell or not?

181
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:27,908
Sir, you brought me here
and thrashing.

182
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:31,408
If my brother knows it,
do you know what would've he done?

183
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:39,449
Hey...to whom?

184
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:42,074
Do you know his power?

185
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,575
You're taking the snacks, everyday.
Give me the money.

186
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,116
Hey! You...
Give me the money.

187
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:00,992
Do you know how big don he is?

188
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:02,950
My life is ruined.
Give me the money.

189
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,783
Turn back and see.
Wastrel..

190
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:09,408
Hey, he is the don of dons!

191
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:12,366
Raj! Pistol Raj!

192
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:14,241
Brother!

193
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:44,491
How dare, you touch my guys?
I've lifted you in the next six hours.

194
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:48,700
You didn't keep
any nails here, right?

195
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,658
I thought you as something.
But, you've abducted the PC.

196
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:53,992
What do you want?
I'll get you.

197
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:55,992
Get us mutton biryani for lunch.

198
00:18:55,992 --> 00:18:59,366
You've done a good job.
Asking just mutton biryani?

199
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,783
Ask me babe, remmy martin
and a room to have fun...

200
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:02,825
At least, get us kuska.

201
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,157
You'll never be changed.

202
00:19:04,157 --> 00:19:04,783
I'll get you.

203
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:05,950
Eat without brawl.

204
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,033
Brother, you're in good mood.

205
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:10,366
Call the police now and tease them.

206
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,033
Good. He must be in the station.

207
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,825
Tell me.
-Hey!

208
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,950
Mr.Pistol Raj!
-Enough of laughing, Panneer.

209
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,241
Very good morning!

210
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:30,074
A guy from the locale clan
was arrested.

211
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:35,783
Who is that?
He must be an honest police officer.

212
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:39,283
Who is he?
-Think and tell me.

213
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,575
Might be 'Panneerselvam'!

214
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:42,575
I can't accept it.

215
00:19:42,575 --> 00:19:44,658
You can't believe, isn't it?

216
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:48,408
Are you in the fish market?

217
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:49,700
Save us, brother.

218
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,825
Did you hear the screaming
of your guys?

219
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:58,241
But, I've abducted two police people,
do you know it?

220
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:00,241
They both are higher officials.

221
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,866
Will you heed their
screaming sound, now?

222
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:07,199
Untie and make them
to scream.

223
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,825
What's the language
they're speaking?

224
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:11,825
Will they be the Delhi police?
-Delhi police? Show their face.

225
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:14,700
Hey, I told you abduct the
Tamil Nadu police.

226
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,283
Why did you bring them?

227
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,950
How  crowded it was?

228
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,658
We planned and abducted them.
-Crowd in the police station?

229
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:23,616
Did you bring them from the
Saidapet police station?

230
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:25,658
This is what I don't like in you.

231
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:28,324
You said as station,
but didn't say which station?

232
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:30,033
You told to abduct within six hours.

233
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:33,324
We've trained ourselves and in the last half
an hour we went to the railway station…

234
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:36,575
…amidst the crowd hit them
and brought here.

235
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:39,741
What's there to plan for six hours?

236
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:43,408
They'd have come by walk
when given hundred rupees, each.

237
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,116
Senseless demons.
-Hello! Panneer, over...

238
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:49,283
You keep speaking alone.

239
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,992
I'll call you back, okay?
-Okay.

240
00:20:51,992 --> 00:20:54,491
You'll get caught to me.

241
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:58,324
My grandfather is a Gurkha from Nepal.

242
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,741
My family belongs to Gurkhas.

243
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:03,575
I too did the same job
and now became a thug.

244
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,866
You speak to Sam Antony.
He'll tell you.

245
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:09,157
It's a gift.
Keep it.

246
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:10,408
You also have it.

247
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:12,908
My address is Anna nagar first street...

248
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:14,157
Okay.

249
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:16,866
Bye!
-What's it?

250
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,324
You senseless.

251
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:20,658
I told you to abduct the police
but you brought my relatives.

252
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:22,783
Brother, That is...
-Demon.

253
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,033
I'm tensed.

254
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,533
Take the vehicle to the bar.

255
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,366
It's nearby, let's go by walk.

256
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,992
You don't tell me how to go.

257
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:31,866
The creditors are searching for me.
They'll yell at me.

258
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:33,616
Come, I;ll take the vehicle.

259
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:34,324
I'm asking, everyday.

260
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:35,950
What is he doing?

261
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,908
That's drug.

262
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:40,366
The stuff we smuggled.

263
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:42,199
When did we do it?

264
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,324
We're just passing the time.

265
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:45,908
Ask him to come
pouring that powder.

266
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:47,992
Just to show off.
- We won't get food, then.

267
00:21:51,365 --> 00:21:53,282
Who is he looking like this?.

268
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:57,615
Doesn't he look like a drunkard
in his style of sitting?

269
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,990
He knows what we've.

270
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:03,823
He'll look back in few minutes.

271
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:23,990
He looked away.
Hide the alcohol.

272
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,115
Cheers!

273
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:44,574
Hey...

274
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,781
Brother, our fortune table is there.
Let's go there.

275
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:49,198
This table is free.
-Our fortune is here.

276
00:22:49,198 --> 00:22:50,198
What about the guys?

277
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:52,115
We'll send them creating a ruckus.

278
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:55,031
Go, brother.
-How are you, kin?

279
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:56,407
Who is he?

280
00:22:56,407 --> 00:23:00,448
My school teacher.
We both will study together.

281
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:02,031
Hey, pity guys!
-I want egg scramble.

282
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:02,656
What do you want?

283
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,574
A Plate of chicken.
-Chicken?

284
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:08,282
Why nine people have come
to attend a single table?

285
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:09,781
I'll give only ten rupees.

286
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:13,031
Ask him for extra money.
First, tell him who I'm.

287
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:15,115
Hey, you're speaking without
knowing about him.

288
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:23,990
He is a ruffian.
Will tear you and sweeten.

289
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,739
When did I do so?

290
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:26,948
I too want a plate of sweet.

291
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,865
I can't give it.
Tell me in detail.

292
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,115
Hey, Raj! Pistol raj!

293
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:36,948
Brother, I've seen you somewhere.

294
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,282
I met you in a journey.
I remember it.

295
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:43,574
How is sister-in-law?

296
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:45,698
Is she still selling the powder?

297
00:23:45,698 --> 00:23:50,990
No, selling flour.
-Brother!

298
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,448
It's always a problem.

299
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:53,282
Is it about wife?

300
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:55,031
Wife means problem.

301
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,698
Yes, a wife is always a problem.

302
00:23:57,698 --> 00:23:58,574
Is it?

303
00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:00,323
Go ahead.
-Okay.

304
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:03,323
Dude, not only wife,
my mom is also a problem.

305
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:04,532
Your mom too?

306
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:05,698
What happened?

307
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:10,031
It's a small issue with chutney.

308
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,574
They began quarreling in the house
and dragged to the street.

309
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:17,990
The neighbors are enjoying like
watching WWF.

310
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:19,448
You won't believe me.

311
00:24:19,448 --> 00:24:20,990
They ask for once more.

312
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:22,240
Serve one more round.

313
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
Pour it.

314
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:30,240
Hey, booze quietly.
-I'm not.

315
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,865
Sorry, sir.

316
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:32,115
Who is that weeping?

317
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:33,656
He is!

318
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:35,532
Oh man, it's you!

319
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:36,823
What?

320
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:40,031
To attend an interview,
I asked hundred rupees to my mother-in-law.

321
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:40,823
Mother-in-law?

322
00:24:40,823 --> 00:24:42,698
It's English.

323
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:46,948
She is asking me to assist my father-in-law.
-Father-in-law?

324
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:50,031
Even my wife says the same.
-Will you speak only English?

325
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:54,073
Yes! I started to interview thinking to
end everything.

326
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:54,906
I know.

327
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:56,490
I've confidence on you.

328
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,574
But, looking at my resume,
the manager expelled me.

329
00:24:59,574 --> 00:25:00,739
I know that too.

330
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,240
Spell the word, 'Resume'.

331
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,948
R- e-m-u-s-e

332
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:07,407
Then, how it's possible?

333
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:09,031
Making great fun.

334
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:11,323
Panneer thought of me as a wastrel.
Isn't it?

335
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,198
Hey, open without sound,
he might get disturbed.

336
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:16,365
Damn it.
Get lost.

337
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:21,282
If you touch it,
I'll yell at you.

338
00:25:21,282 --> 00:25:22,157
Keep it.

339
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:28,115
Hey, call the police.
-Okay.

340
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:38,282
Brother, it's not reachable.

341
00:25:38,532 --> 00:25:39,948
Try the voice message.

342
00:25:41,198 --> 00:25:43,198
Lion!
- Speak now.

343
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:46,157
Hey, Panneer!

344
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,823
Dare to show your
police attitude to me.

345
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:53,906
If I decide,
I'll take off your police attires.

346
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:55,532
And show you off
in nude to all.

347
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:59,781
I'll make the police station
as massage centre.

348
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:02,781
Am I looking like a goof?

349
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:06,574
Hey, do you know the mass of this
pistol Raj?

350
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,615
Heard you've told to lift me.

351
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,198
Will you see what happens?

352
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:11,948
What's that you say in Hindi?

353
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:14,323
'Wait and watch'.
-That's it.

354
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,781
Wait and watch.

355
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:18,365
Hey, Goutham!

356
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:20,532
Don't get married.

357
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:25,615
If you get married,
you'll suffer like us, everyday.

358
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:27,157
You're right!
-Get lost.

359
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:30,574
I'm telling you,
don't get married.

360
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:33,574
You enjoyed everything
and doesn't want me to marry.

361
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:36,157
Oh, what does he mean
as everything?

362
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:37,323
Oh, you mean that...

363
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:39,240
That's not like that...

364
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:41,407
How to tell?
Tell him.

365
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:42,990
Hey, how do I know?

366
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,198
Kitchen, entrance door and terrace.

367
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:48,823
What's this? You're saying like
'Dora Bujji'

368
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:51,948
That's how my life journey is going on.
-Damn it!

369
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:53,240
I need a break.

370
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:55,157
I've decided.
-Get lost.

371
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:59,157
I'm going for a drive in my bike.

372
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:01,240
What's this life and wife?

373
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,656
I don't want anything.

374
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:06,282
I'll come along with you.
-I’ll also come along.

375
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:09,990
If I go home now, my dad
will compel me to get her married.

376
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:11,282
Fill the tank.

377
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:14,240
Dude, let's go to
nearby Pondicherry, at least.

378
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,615
Why? let's go to Pattaya.

379
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:17,990
Can we go?

380
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,906
Shall we go?

381
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:21,240
Why are you asking like that?

382
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,739
We're going and enjoying.

383
00:27:24,698 --> 00:27:26,323
Let's forget all the issues.

384
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:30,823
We're going to pattaya to rock.
-Yes!

385
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:36,615
Put the chair.
-Be seated.

386
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:42,865
I'm Mana Madurai Subramanya
Ganapathy Deenadayalan.

387
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:44,574
Shortly as, 'MSD'.

388
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:46,823
He says as if he is t
he captain of 'CSK'.

389
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:47,656
Wastrel.

390
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:49,490
We're all brothers.

391
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:50,865
Okay, come back in two days.
Don't ask for the money.

392
00:27:51,073 --> 00:27:54,240
Brother, you got a message.

393
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:55,739
What it'll be?

394
00:27:55,865 --> 00:27:58,198
He must be crying.
-Play it, let's listen.

395
00:27:58,198 --> 00:27:58,781
Listen now.

396
00:27:58,781 --> 00:28:01,407
Pistol Raj! Do you think of me
as a dog wagging tail for you.

397
00:28:01,407 --> 00:28:03,698
Even the child in the womb
will keep it's finger on mouth...

398
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,698
... when hearing my name, Panneerselvam.

399
00:28:05,698 --> 00:28:07,739
Clean hands.

400
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:10,615
I'm the police dog,
carrying the death in my pocket.

401
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:12,990
Not the dog which wags for bone.

402
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,574
Your game is over.

403
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:17,365
Panneer, you must go around
with money in the pocket.

404
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:19,115
Not the death.

405
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,865
To whom are you pranking?

406
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:25,948
I'll come along with my guys
and lift your family.

407
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:28,365
Will you see?

408
00:28:28,365 --> 00:28:30,739
Brother, look at me, first.

409
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:35,240
I forgot to press the sound recorder
in WhatsApp.

410
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,990
Didn't you press?

411
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,490
Admiring as you was speaking, fluently,

412
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,574
I forgot to press it.

413
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:43,574
I'll record this time,
speak in the same way.

414
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:44,574
That was excellent.

415
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:46,157
I'll get the fluency, once.

416
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,157
Buffalo!

417
00:28:47,157 --> 00:28:48,365
Press it again.

418
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:52,823
Good!

419
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:54,948
What are you blabbering?

420
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:56,865
She looks good.
-See properly.

421
00:28:58,198 --> 00:28:59,031
Show me too.

422
00:28:59,157 --> 00:29:01,490
Hey, she is the aunty!

423
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:09,031
I know her.

424
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:10,407
I've done.

425
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:12,323
I too did.
-What's that?

426
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:13,532
'Musically'.

427
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:17,739
Musically with everyone.
But, tragically with me.

428
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:23,739
Whenever she downloads an application,

429
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:30,906
She'll upload an punch for me.

430
00:29:30,906 --> 00:29:32,781
My dear dude!

431
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,781
We'll caress!

432
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,282
We'll caress!

433
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:38,532
I'll show her.
-We'll caress!

434
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:41,198
Will you stop this bullshit?

435
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:42,865
Who is bullshit?

436
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:43,906
It's you.

437
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,948
If you don't like, sit aside.

438
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:47,031
I'll do only like this.

439
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:48,323
I'll throw this phone in the water.

440
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:49,781
You and musically, shit.

441
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:51,656
Give me the phone.

442
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,198
That musically is bullshit.

443
00:29:56,823 --> 00:29:58,656
We're better.
-Shameless.

444
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,490
This is my life.

445
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,948
Don't feel, sir.

446
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:03,240
I can understand your feelings.

447
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:07,282
The match box is mine.

448
00:30:07,282 --> 00:30:09,073
Let it be, I'll ignite and give you.

449
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,407
Only one match stick is there.
-It's okay.

450
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:15,656
Your tone as thug is excellent.

451
00:30:15,656 --> 00:30:17,781
But, your countenance
looks like a funny toy.

452
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:20,031
Brother...
-Funny toy?

453
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,031
Hey...
- The match box.

454
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:22,615
Did I say something else?

455
00:30:27,615 --> 00:30:30,906
Hey, give the box.

456
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:34,906
Am I looking like
a coffin box maker?

457
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,448
Give me the match box.

458
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:37,948
Oh! match box.

459
00:30:39,157 --> 00:30:41,490
I want the unignited stick.

460
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,574
Then, there are two coconut sticks.
Go and take it.

461
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:48,698
You aren't aware of this 'Locale Philips'

462
00:30:49,073 --> 00:30:50,448
'Locale Philips'?

463
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,781
He seems to be the
loud mouth in his locale.

464
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:54,532
Hey, what's that?

465
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:56,073
Is it Jolarpet or Nazarethpet?

466
00:30:56,073 --> 00:30:57,407
Kannammapet.

467
00:30:57,407 --> 00:31:00,698
You look like a cadaver
buried two days ago.

468
00:31:00,698 --> 00:31:02,906
There are lot of problems.

469
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:03,532
Go away.

470
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:06,865
If you don't give the matchbox,
I'll create ruckus.

471
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,574
Philips, you're speaking more.

472
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:10,781
Won't you go?

473
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:12,781
I'll pound you to pulp.
Go away.

474
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:15,157
Oh, no! I'm afraid.

475
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:17,157
Philips, are you playing with him?

476
00:31:17,157 --> 00:31:19,698
If he speaks harsh,
I too will speak the same.

477
00:31:19,698 --> 00:31:20,490
Is it?

478
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:26,073
He thinks of him as 'Mass leader'
Take him away.

479
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:28,532
Go away.

480
00:31:28,532 --> 00:31:30,115
Whom are you hitting?

481
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:31,990
Hit him.

482
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:39,739
Shouldn't we create ruckus?
Let's see.

483
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:42,240
Silence, please.

484
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,698
Hey, go. I saw you in a
Sunny Leone's poster.

485
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:46,739
Hey, I'm telling you,
but you keep talking.

486
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,448
Loot the money from cash box,
to meet our expenses.

487
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:51,781
They're breaking the things.

488
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:53,574
Call the police.
Call soon.

489
00:31:53,574 --> 00:31:56,490
Hey, uncle.
what are you doing here?

490
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,240
We can take all these
at this time.

491
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,532
Already, people talk cheap
about our family and you prove it.

492
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:06,781
Sir, ruckus going on here.
Come soon, sir.

493
00:32:07,656 --> 00:32:09,365
Your coat is with me.

494
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:12,323
Give the coat to sir.

495
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,198
Hey, bring him here.

496
00:32:15,198 --> 00:32:17,073
Leave him, down.
-Run away.

497
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:20,240
Pistol, you might feel bad
about it, later.

498
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,615
If I say, once...

499
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:25,240
You've created ruckus just
for a match stick and speaking...

500
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,365
Will you ask the matchstick?

501
00:32:27,365 --> 00:32:29,198
What's this?

502
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,948
I and my BMW.

503
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,407
Where?

504
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:07,574
It's a familiar drug,world wide.

505
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:12,240
For example Marijuana, Heroin,
Cocaine, LSD, snake bite etc...

506
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,073
But, this drug is more
dangerous than all these.

507
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:17,906
This drug has the potential
to transform the...

508
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:21,157
...human being as
a complete animal.

509
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:23,365
People, beware of fake drugs.

510
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:25,115
Thank you for listening me, patiently.

511
00:34:25,115 --> 00:34:29,031
And one more thing I want to share with
you all is about the virus, 'Solanum'.

512
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:31,448
It's a fictional virus.

513
00:34:31,448 --> 00:34:35,240
This virus and the broiler chicken
are related.

514
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,574
It takes 150 days for the
growth of a broiler chicken.

515
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:43,323
But, they use 18 injections for the business
and for the growth of the chicken.

516
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:46,781
Those who eat that chicken,
gets affected by virus...

517
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:50,698
...behave like animals
and die in a situation.

518
00:34:50,698 --> 00:34:52,115
So, eat safe.
Thank you.

519
00:34:52,115 --> 00:34:53,739
Excellent, Ishwarya.

520
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,574
Hey, girls.

521
00:34:54,574 --> 00:34:57,906
Already, you've been informed
about our college trip.

522
00:34:57,906 --> 00:35:01,990
So, everyone come to the
prayer hall at 4 o'clock.

523
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,115
Thank you.

524
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,407
Hey, what are you reading?

525
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,532
The weekly magazine.

526
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:39,407
Do you know why are we here?
-Don't know.

527
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:40,407
When it was published?
-Two years ago.

528
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:42,865
Two years ago.

529
00:35:42,865 --> 00:35:44,739
You owned a crap shop. Isn't it?

530
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:45,823
Shut your trap and keep it.

531
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:49,198
I'm afraid whether Panneer
will encounter me.

532
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:51,031
Brother, don't be afraid.

533
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:51,990
Will you enjoy after my encounter?

534
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:53,574
Brother, take a cigarette.

535
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,823
Ignited it?

536
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,490
Yes, long before.

537
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,739
After igniting,
Did you smoke?

538
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:02,698
Okay, give me the phone.

539
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:04,906
Why are you asking
your phone to me?

540
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:08,031
You were speaking to Panneer
in the bar, isn't it?

541
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:10,365
I gave it to you.

542
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:12,115
Have you given?
-Yes.

543
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:13,282
Check whether it's in your vest?

544
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:15,240
Dial to my number.

545
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:22,532
Damn it.
Who is this?

546
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,073
He disconnects the call.

547
00:36:29,906 --> 00:36:31,157
Is he disconnecting?

548
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:32,781
Call from your number.

549
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:35,781
I'm not getting the fancy number.

550
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:37,157
I hate you.
- He disconnects.

551
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:37,698
Is it?

552
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:39,865
Call from your's.

553
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,574
He'll take at once.

554
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:43,865
Brother.
-What?

555
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:45,282
Don't you have charge?
- I don't have your number.

556
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:46,781
Don't you have my number?

557
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:48,698
How long have you been with me?

558
00:36:48,865 --> 00:36:50,781
For six years.
Six years?

559
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:52,656
So, simply you're being with me.

560
00:36:53,532 --> 00:36:54,739
Isn't it you who brought him to
our clan?

561
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:55,323
Yes, he is my relative.

562
00:36:55,323 --> 00:36:57,407
Get lost.
Call from your  number.

563
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:57,990
Okay.

564
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:02,865
Who is he looking like
Zombie producer?

565
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:03,574
Who are you?

566
00:37:03,615 --> 00:37:04,532
Hello!

567
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:05,739
Who is this?

568
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:09,073
I'm the owner of the phone.

569
00:37:09,073 --> 00:37:11,823
I won't speak to the relative.

570
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,282
Ask the owner of the phone to speak.

571
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:15,739
I'm the owner of the phone.

572
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:17,365
Give me my phone.

573
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,656
You owned it until you had it.

574
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,407
It's with me now,
I'm the owner.

575
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,365
I plead you.

576
00:37:24,365 --> 00:37:25,490
That's the Apple phone.

577
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,990
Then, I'll store in the fridge after speaking.

578
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,282
Keeping in the fridge?

579
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,073
Nice teasing, isn't it?

580
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:34,615
What's that he teased?

581
00:37:34,615 --> 00:37:35,448
But, you're laughing.

582
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:37,698
Good teasing brother.
- Shut your trap.

583
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:40,656
Important matters are in that phone.

584
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:41,865
Please give me.

585
00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:45,365
Is it about actress Shakila?

586
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:49,157
Shakila and Sunny Leone...
Where are we going?

587
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:52,031
Hey, wastrel.

588
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:54,865
Give back my cellphone.
There are many important things in it.

589
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:58,656
Are you laughing as a clan?

590
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,656
If I come there,
you'll cry as a clan.

591
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,781
To whom? You fraudulent.

592
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,115
Hey, you...

593
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:08,198
I'm a gangster. If I come,
you'll be thumped.

594
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:11,115
I'm also a gangster.

595
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:19,906
I'm telling you,
give me the phone.

596
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:22,365
If not, I'll blaze you all.

597
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:23,990
Are we sugarcane field
to blaze us, together?

598
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,365
Who are you?

599
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:29,490
I'll stab you, once and all.

600
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,490
Are you threatening me?

601
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,407
Dare to me?

602
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:35,073
Yell him, sir.

603
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:38,157
Yes, that's right.

604
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:39,198
Yell him.

605
00:38:39,198 --> 00:38:41,323
Sir, who is speaking?

606
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:42,865
You speak very decently.

607
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:45,115
Who are you speaking?

608
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:48,115

609
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:50,198
Sir, it's okay.
Tell me.

610
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:52,990
I shouldn't say.
Who are you?

611
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,115
I'm the don of this locale.

612
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:57,323
Don?

613
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,615
You wastrel, idiot, goof.

614
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:03,615
I'll speak only like this.

615
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,906
Wait, my dude speaks.

616
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:08,990
Hey, what do you want?
Come on, if you're dare enough.

617
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,490
Get two bottles of cool beer.

00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,990
Dude,you speak on.

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,407
Come on.

620
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:16,157
Do you think we're scared?

621
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:17,990
Look at his moss.

622
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,115
Hey...

623
00:39:21,865 --> 00:39:24,781
Beep sound for Pistol.

624
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,781
He is yelling to the core.

625
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:33,031
Whether I get my phone or not,
he yelled at me alone.

626
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:35,240
But, these guys yelled me as clan.

627
00:39:35,656 --> 00:39:39,990
If get caught to me,
I'll pound them.

628
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:41,823
Come, let's go.

629

630
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,407
Where is the shopkeeper looking at?

631
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:48,615
The other side.

632
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:50,448
If we start the vehicle,
he'll find out.

633
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:51,739
I'll go by walk, come behind me
taking the vehicle.

634
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:53,115
Come on.

635
00:39:56,198 --> 00:40:00,115
Mr. Pistol Raj,
I got order to shoot you.

636
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:01,532
Are you going to shoot me?

637
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:08,906
I'll thrash whoever it is.

638
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,739
Encounter is ready for you.

639
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:15,407
Whoever counter is it,

00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:18,990
I'm not a layman to afraid.

641
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:23,990
A native of the locale, Philips.

642
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,115
This isn't like Pistol Raj's voice.

643
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,448
Yes, sir.
It's someone.

644
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:30,990

Do whatever,

00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:46,407

00:41:03,115 --> 00:41:03,906
Go soon.

652
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:05,906
Who are you?
-Sir, aren't we going to Pattaya?

653
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:08,073
You dare to go to Bangkok in my car?

654
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:11,157
Sir, I'm saying the locale Pattaya.
Sir, look at this.

00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:16,115
We're friends, sir.
-Yes, sir.

657
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:18,365
Have you forgot?

658
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:20,365
It's alright.

659
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:22,198
I've an urgent meeting.

660
00:41:22,198 --> 00:41:23,906
I must leave now.

661
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:25,031
I'll book a 'Uber cab' for you.

662
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:26,448
Everyone go home.
-What's that 'Uber'?

663
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:30,574
Tell him.
-What can I tell him?

664
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:34,031
Sir, if we go home,
it's wife and tension there.

665
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:36,323
Now, we've to do household works...

666
00:41:36,323 --> 00:41:38,073
We haven't come here to talk about
your personal issues.

667
00:41:38,073 --> 00:41:40,532
Sir, I've to manage both
my wife and mom.

668
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:41,781
Can you talk about your personal issue?

669
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,031
It's not like your's.

670
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:45,865
Hey, stop it.

671
00:41:46,323 --> 00:41:48,490
Sir, think well.

672
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:51,073
When you go home,
your wife will do tiktok…

673
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:53,031
…which ends up in quarrel.

674
00:41:53,323 --> 00:41:55,198
You'll feel bad till the next morning.

675
00:41:55,532 --> 00:41:56,739
Then, you'll booze.

676
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:58,990
If others are decent like us, no problem.

677
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,865
If anyone kidnaps you and grabs money,

678
00:42:01,865 --> 00:42:02,823
Think over.

679
00:42:02,823 --> 00:42:04,656
Please, sir.
-What they say is right.

680
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:07,073
She'll play Musically if I go home.

681
00:42:07,073 --> 00:42:09,656
It takes minimum ten times
to do a single Tiktok.

682
00:42:09,656 --> 00:42:11,073
Ten...twenty...thirty...

683
00:42:20,115 --> 00:42:21,656
Ten... twenty...three...

684
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:23,073
Impossible pain.

685
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:29,448
I can't bear.

686
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:30,574
Let's go.

687
00:42:30,574 --> 00:42:32,865
Let's have fun.

688
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:35,157
You kept the iPhone down.

689
00:42:35,157 --> 00:42:37,990
It wasn't mine.
Stolen in the bar.

690
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,448
Switch it off and keep inside.

691
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:42,157
Go...
Get into the car.

692
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:43,490
He has stolen the iPhone!

693
00:42:43,823 --> 00:42:45,948
Stop...stop man.

694
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:49,365
Vow!

695
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:52,448
I think this resort will be good.

696
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:54,407
Very nice place.

697
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:56,365
If it's free, anything will be good.

698
00:42:57,948 --> 00:42:58,781
Greetings, sir!

699
00:42:58,781 --> 00:42:59,448
Hi!
-Welcome, sir.

00:42:59,448 --> 00:43:00,365
Any two rooms.

701
00:43:00,365 --> 00:43:02,282
Is the suite okay, sir?
-With private gym.

702
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:04,073
He is irating me.

703
00:43:04,574 --> 00:43:06,323
Sorry, sir.
Definitely, one room is available.

704
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,240
We had a bulk booking, earlier.
-What!

705
00:43:08,448 --> 00:43:10,574
Even if I come alone,
I'll book two rooms.

706
00:43:10,574 --> 00:43:12,656
One for sleeping
and the other for thinking.

707
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:14,407
Let's go and book in another resort.
Come on.

708
00:43:14,574 --> 00:43:15,615
Bloody losers.

00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,925

00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:28,091
You listen carefully

786
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:31,925
This life is too short
Don't say, which is right or wrong

787
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:35,508
This age will not come back

788
00:49:35,508 --> 00:49:39,300
Enjoyment in full swing
Don't feel bored,

789
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,842

Don't you've sense?
-Look there.

810
00:51:37,717 --> 00:51:38,592
When did he lie next to me?

811
00:51:38,592 --> 00:51:40,300
What's this?

812
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:42,508
I took it, last night.
-That means?

813
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,050
Bloody beer.

814
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:46,091
Oh, bottle!

815
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,216
Oh, it's so late.

816
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:49,425
I've to go immediately.

817
00:51:49,425 --> 00:51:51,508
You didn't give me food,
last night.

818
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:52,967
Get me breakfast.

819
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,550
I want my ghee dosa, now.

820
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,925
Sir, if we call them and order,
they'll get it.

821
00:51:57,925 --> 00:52:00,592
I tried, they aren't attending the call.

822
00:52:00,592 --> 00:52:01,717
Go and get it.

823
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:03,883
That's okay,
what about the money?

824
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,300

00:52:06,842 --> 00:52:08,633
The card is with me.
-Do you've the card?

831
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,466
Does your dad own the eatery?

832
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:26,466
Who will pay for it?
-Wastrel, I'll hit you.

833
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:28,050
Hey, come on.
-He is irritating, dude.

00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:33,675
That babe was somewhere, here.

835
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,508
Nice dress.

836
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:07,383
Hi!
-What?

837
00:53:07,383 --> 00:53:10,633
Do you've a box?

That is...lighter?

839
00:53:13,258 --> 00:53:17,675

00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:20,883
I followed you,
but you got in..

841
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:24,091
That's why, I came to greet you
and have coffee.

842
00:53:24,341 --> 00:53:26,133
Now, it's noon.

843
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:28,009
Even at noon,

844
00:53:28,925 --> 00:53:31,508

Is anyone there?

848
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,466
Where did you go?

849
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:41,050
Hey!
-No one is here.

850
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,300
Where did you go?

851
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:45,967
Hey...

852
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:47,842
No one is here, but the
contact number is busy.

853
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:50,842
Being here, are you calling the
reception number?

854
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:51,800
I'll kill you.

855
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,383
I'm hungry.
-I too feel hungry.

856
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:58,550
Why did you bring me,
if he is hungry?

857
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,800
Am I his personal assistant or you?

858
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:03,466
What are you looking there?
-My girlfriend is going.

859
00:54:04,592 --> 00:54:05,842
Is she your girlfriend?
-Yes.

860
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,425
Is she?
-Yes, don't I know her?

861
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:10,550
He is speaking.

862
00:54:13,675 --> 00:54:17,300
Do you need enjoyment of women?

863
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:18,675
You need.

864
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:19,550
It's okay.

865
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,592
Come, let's go together.

866
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,133
Come.

867
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:23,466
Just a minute.

868
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,717
Take the rose.
Only then, we can do something.

869
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:32,717
Don't disturb me.

870
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,466
He isn't letting me to sleep.

871
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:15,425
Get in.
-Okay, come in.

872
00:57:16,883 --> 00:57:18,133
Come in.

873
00:57:19,258 --> 00:57:22,717
Excuse me, I thought of speaking
to you, last night.

874
00:57:22,717 --> 00:57:24,341
But, you were busy.

875
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:25,675
We too were busy.

876
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:30,425
You look very beautiful.

877
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,925
Your eyes are like grapes.

878
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:40,300
Your cheeks look like an apple.

879
00:57:40,675 --> 00:57:44,300
And your lips looks like an orange.

880
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,633
What's this?
Instead of speaking romantic,

881
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,383
You're speaking like a fruit vendor.

882
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:49,383
Ask her contact number.

883
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,425
Excuse me, give me your
WhatsApp number…

884
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:53,800
…Facebook ID, Instagram or Twitter.

885
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,592
Only then, we can exchange our words.

886
00:57:56,592 --> 00:57:57,925
Good!

887
00:57:58,216 --> 00:58:00,717
Give me.
She isn't turning.

888
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:01,758
Wait, I'll talk.

889
00:58:02,675 --> 00:58:05,842
Actually, you would've been brought up
with utmost care.

890
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:08,550
You might feel more shy.

891
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,009
Yeah.

892
00:58:10,009 --> 00:58:12,300
But, you can turn to him.

893
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,758
Wait, I'll tell.

894
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:17,383
I love you...
I feel shy.

895
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:22,800
Hey, she looks like the mixing
of all the fruits you said.

896
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,800
Damn it.
Look there.

897
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:27,174
She is looking like as you said.
-Run away.

898
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,758
It's a wrong matter.

899
00:58:34,758 --> 00:58:36,091
Hey, Philips...

900
00:58:36,091 --> 00:58:37,383
MSD sir.

901
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,675
Haven't you been taught,
how to behave with women?

902
00:58:41,675 --> 00:58:43,258
It's not me, sir.
It's only her.

903
00:58:43,675 --> 00:58:46,508
Hey, you...
perverted fellow...

904
00:58:48,009 --> 00:58:49,091
What happened?

905
00:58:52,925 --> 00:58:54,592
Tell me, Kavya!
What happened?

906
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:07,800
Tell me, what happened?

907
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:34,341
I'm scared.

908
01:00:37,174 --> 01:00:37,717
Go.

909
01:00:42,633 --> 01:00:44,216
Come on.

910
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:46,258
Come, let's go.

911
01:00:46,258 --> 01:00:47,508
Come, let's go soon.

912
01:00:48,675 --> 01:00:49,758
Let's go soon.

913
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,717
Come, let's go the other side.

914
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,550
She is eating like a grill chicken.

915
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:50,717
Leave her.
Take your hand off.

916
01:01:50,717 --> 01:01:51,925
Hey, who are you?

917
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,300
Hey, you...

918
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,466
Even if the law allows,
I'll not allow.

919
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:57,341
I'm not single.
I'm already married.

920
01:01:57,341 --> 01:01:58,133
Help me!

921
01:01:58,133 --> 01:02:00,341
Someone save him.
Somebody help me!

922
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,216
Come on, sir.

923
01:02:01,216 --> 01:02:08,383
She is not a woman,
leave her.

924
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,508
Help me!

925
01:02:09,508 --> 01:02:13,050
Come fast!

926
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:25,216
Come fast.
Come on.

927
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:34,842
What's this, sir!

928
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:48,009
I heard the sound.

929
01:02:48,133 --> 01:02:49,425
From where?

930
01:02:53,174 --> 01:02:54,675
I heard the sound.

931
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,300
Come, let's go.

932
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,091
Come fast.

933
01:03:05,091 --> 01:03:07,300
Come soon.

934
01:03:17,383 --> 01:03:19,925
I heard some sound.

935
01:03:31,425 --> 01:03:33,425
It's blood everywhere!
-Yes, dude!

936
01:03:45,216 --> 01:03:46,341
Don't hit me.

937
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:48,009
Sir!
Please, sir!

938
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:49,800
Don't hit me.

939
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,174
I'm the Manager!
-ID card?

940
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:54,717
Sorry, sir.
-Why are you apologizing?

941
01:03:54,717 --> 01:03:56,133
It's not fault to hit him.

942
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:58,050
What's happening in this resort?

943
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,592
Sir, don't know what's happening?

944
01:03:59,592 --> 01:04:01,592
Since morning,
everyone is biting each other.

945
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:03,300
Somehow, I've escaped.

946
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,174
Save me.

947
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,050
We too have escaped.
Come.

948
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,592
If we save him,
the loss to the hotel must be more.

949
01:04:09,592 --> 01:04:11,341
Sir, don't think of the expenses.
Save me.

950
01:04:21,967 --> 01:04:23,383
What?

951
01:04:23,383 --> 01:04:25,133
It's like someone is near.

952
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,009
Hey, send him.

953
01:04:28,009 --> 01:04:29,425
Brother, you go.

954
01:04:30,758 --> 01:04:32,425
Let him go...

955
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:34,133
Should I go?
-Go.

956
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:35,758
You must go.

957
01:04:35,758 --> 01:04:37,050
Let someone go.
-Go...

958
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:41,466
Hey, go...

959
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,675
Hey, Goutham! Are you still alive?

960
01:04:51,675 --> 01:04:54,050
Still alive?
-Who is he?

961
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,341
He is the resort manager.

962
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:57,883
Guys, let's not waste time.
We'll leave fast.

963
01:04:57,883 --> 01:04:58,925
Very good idea.

964
01:04:59,383 --> 01:05:00,967
You can join the clan.
Let's go.

965
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:03,800
If we go this way,
will reach the car parking.

966
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:09,174
Hey!
Go!

967
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:36,174
Look there!

968
01:05:38,592 --> 01:05:39,675
My god!

969
01:05:44,216 --> 01:05:46,383
Guys!
My Car!

970
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:50,967
Come on, guys!
Open the car.

971
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:51,883
Get the key.

972
01:05:51,883 --> 01:05:54,550
Open the car.

973
01:05:54,550 --> 01:06:00,216
Give me the key.

974
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:04,425
Get into the car.

975
01:06:04,425 --> 01:06:07,383
Go...

976
01:06:07,383 --> 01:06:08,925
Get on.

977
01:06:08,925 --> 01:06:10,967
Go away.

978
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:21,690
Bloody fools!

979
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:24,023
You made me and my
car to stuck in trouble.

980
01:07:24,023 --> 01:07:26,065
Sir, we too got stuck.

981
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,149
You're frustrating us.

982
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:28,857
What's this!

983
01:07:29,231 --> 01:07:32,149
They attacked us few minutes before,
now going for a walk.

984
01:07:32,149 --> 01:07:34,190
But, why they've
changed suddenly?

985
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:34,940
I don't know.

986
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:37,940
From morning, everyone's behaviour
is changing one and another.

987
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,815
I think, it's a virus attack.

988
01:07:39,898 --> 01:07:40,773
They're Zombies.

989
01:07:40,773 --> 01:07:42,857
They'll attack us
if they see us together.

990
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:45,065
Else, they'll move around, alone.

991
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:45,857
Zombie!

992
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:47,898
Is it like which is seen
in Hollywood films?

993
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:48,648
Zombie?

994
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:49,606
What's that mean?

995
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,523
It's Zombie.
-Zombie!

996
01:07:51,523 --> 01:07:52,606
Okay.

997
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:55,565
If the Zombie bites a human,
even the human will transform the same.

998
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:57,648
Wonder, how all these has happened?

999
01:07:57,648 --> 01:07:58,273
Leave all that.

1000
01:07:58,273 --> 01:07:59,398
How are we going
to escape from it?

1001
01:08:00,231 --> 01:08:01,107
No idea.

1002
01:08:01,107 --> 01:08:02,107
What? No idea?

1003
01:08:02,107 --> 01:08:03,023
You spoke as if you
know everything.

1004
01:08:03,023 --> 01:08:03,982
Now, you say as no idea.

1005
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,273
Dude, where did you get this?

1006
01:08:07,273 --> 01:08:08,857
It's the stock at the back.

1007
01:08:08,857 --> 01:08:10,815
Dude, stock is at the back.

1008
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:13,440
What's going on here
and what are you doing?

1009
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,773
Is this necessary, now?

1010
01:08:15,606 --> 01:08:16,440
Oh, god!

1011
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,398
We'll get an idea if we drink this.
- Yes.

1012
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:20,356
Do you want?
-I'm a teetotaler, sorry.

1013
01:08:23,023 --> 01:08:26,440
Sir, you shouldn't believe the tongue.

1014
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,940
But, with your teeth...

1015
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,773
You do it.
-Give me.

1016
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:36,481
One...two...three...

1017
01:08:38,023 --> 01:08:38,606
Great opener!

1018
01:08:38,606 --> 01:08:39,273
Thank you.

1019
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,982
Cheers!
-Cheers!

1020
01:08:48,815 --> 01:08:49,398
Officer!.

1021
01:08:50,356 --> 01:08:50,982
Tell me, sir.

1022
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:52,023
I need an information.

1023
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,149
Track the phone of Pistol Raj.

1024
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:58,065
And share his information
data to me.

1025
01:08:58,065 --> 01:09:00,606
Message me the number
and give sometime.

1026
01:09:00,606 --> 01:09:01,314
I'll do, sir .

1027
01:09:05,648 --> 01:09:06,773
Pistol Raj!

1028
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:09,773
It's time for my
pistol to get the job.

1029
01:09:11,273 --> 01:09:13,356
Panneer will roll bullets
in an empty mouth.

1030
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:16,356
My phone was lost.

1031
01:09:16,356 --> 01:09:17,940
If I snatch him, who stole it,
I'll kill  him.

1032
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:19,898
Brother, the call is not
getting connected.

1033
01:09:19,898 --> 01:09:21,190
It's switched off.

1034
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,606
How will you get the line when
everybody dialling the same number?

1035
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,314
Try again.
-I'll do, brother.

1036
01:09:28,023 --> 01:09:30,273
It's switched off, brother.
-Who is this mini cooker?

1037
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,107
Hey, are you from 'Swiggy'?

1038
01:09:33,732 --> 01:09:34,648
Did anyone order the food
without my knowledge?

1039
01:09:34,648 --> 01:09:35,857
No, we didn't.

1040
01:09:36,356 --> 01:09:38,190
You've come to wrong address.

1041
01:09:38,732 --> 01:09:41,149
We don't have money
to place food order.

1042
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:42,523
We eat in the Government canteen.

1043
01:09:42,523 --> 01:09:44,356
You're fatso,
being eating in the canteen.

1044
01:09:44,356 --> 01:09:45,065
Hey, who is he?

1045
01:09:45,065 --> 01:09:47,356
Brother, he is not from 'Swiggy'.
He is a 'Techie'.

1046
01:09:47,356 --> 01:09:48,273
What is meant by 'Techie'?

1047
01:09:48,273 --> 01:09:51,023
He has come to
find out the phone.

1048
01:09:51,023 --> 01:09:51,732
To find the phone?

1049
01:09:51,732 --> 01:09:53,107
Dude, come on.

1050
01:09:53,107 --> 01:09:54,481
What to do,
if you give respect now?

1051
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,523
Be seated.

1052
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:57,065
Isn't there any table
to keep the laptop?

1053
01:09:57,065 --> 01:09:59,732
We've the tomato containers
from the nearby shop.

1054
01:09:59,732 --> 01:10:00,523
Be seated.

1055
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:02,149
Keep it.

1056
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:03,273
It won't be good.

1057
01:10:03,273 --> 01:10:04,231
I know. Keep it aside.

1058
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:05,231
Get adjusted.

1059
01:10:05,231 --> 01:10:06,065
We want the phone.

1060
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:09,314
What?

1061
01:10:09,314 --> 01:10:10,356
I want the phone.

1062
01:10:10,356 --> 01:10:11,231
Why?

1063
01:10:11,356 --> 01:10:14,023
You teased me as 'Swiggy',
that's why I did it.

1064
01:10:14,023 --> 01:10:16,481
The phone is important.
-You start doing the work.

1065
01:10:16,648 --> 01:10:19,273
Why is he showing to the audience?
-That's latest style.

1066
01:10:20,815 --> 01:10:22,023
What is he doing?

1067
01:10:22,023 --> 01:10:23,190
He is wiping the dust.

1068
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,773
Is he wiping the dust?
-Yes.

1069
01:10:25,523 --> 01:10:26,606
Then brother.

1070
01:10:27,565 --> 01:10:29,440
You go ahead,
-Shouldn't I touch you?

1071
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,648
It's okay.
Do whatever.

1072
01:10:30,648 --> 01:10:32,523
What's the model
of the phone?

1073
01:10:32,523 --> 01:10:34,149
Android or iOS?

1074
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:36,231
iPhone and Andrea food.

1075
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:37,356
You mean food?

1076
01:10:37,356 --> 01:10:38,565
He is always thinking of food.

1077
01:10:38,565 --> 01:10:39,523
Who is he?

1078
01:10:39,523 --> 01:10:40,898
It's Android software.

1079
01:10:40,898 --> 01:10:42,065
He is saying the Android software.

1080
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:44,356
Finish the work.
I'll take care, later.

1081
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:46,982
Android software and iPhone seems
to be a new collaboration.

1082
01:10:46,982 --> 01:10:48,565
I too feel the same.

1083
01:10:48,815 --> 01:10:49,565
Tell me.

1084
01:10:49,773 --> 01:10:51,606

Hey, what am I going to do
with your number?

1088
01:10:59,107 --> 01:11:00,773
You'll be sending forward msgs.

1089
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:03,982
If you forward to 50 people,
your mother will be good.

1090
01:11:03,982 --> 01:11:06,356
If you send for 25 people,
your wife will give birth.

1091
01:11:06,356 --> 01:11:07,773
Should I read all those?

1092
01:11:07,773 --> 01:11:09,023
Am I idle like you?

1093
01:11:09,023 --> 01:11:09,648
Sorry, sir.

1094
01:11:09,648 --> 01:11:10,898

01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:12,481
For iphone, Please.

1096
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:15,149
Do you know what
is IMEA number?

1097
01:11:15,149 --> 01:11:16,356
I don't know.

1098
01:11:16,523 --> 01:11:17,273
Hey!

1099
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,773
He can hit me,
until we get the phone.

1100
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:20,023
-Tell me.
Why are they shouting if I hit you?

1101
01:11:20,023 --> 01:11:21,815
They're just acting,
will laugh behind.

1102
01:11:21,815 --> 01:11:28,107
Come here, it means,
International Mobile Equipment Identity.

1103
01:11:28,107 --> 01:11:28,982
Do you've it?

1104
01:11:28,982 --> 01:11:30,398
I don't have an ID.

1105
01:11:30,398 --> 01:11:32,898
I don't have any kind of
Identity proofs.

1106
01:11:32,898 --> 01:11:34,982
Actually, we're afraid and hiding here.

1107
01:11:34,982 --> 01:11:36,481
Are you hiding?
-Yes.

1108
01:11:36,481 --> 01:11:38,440
When you've kept the doors open
and relaxing, is it hiding?

1109
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,523
Tell Vishnu to close
with black cloth.

1110
01:11:40,523 --> 01:11:43,606
Do you've the mobile
pack or the bill?

1111
01:11:43,606 --> 01:11:44,732
Only who bought it might have.

1112
01:11:44,732 --> 01:11:45,398
How can I've?

1113
01:11:45,398 --> 01:11:46,481
Those who bought it, means!

1114
01:11:46,648 --> 01:11:47,648
Is that a stolen phone?

1115
01:11:47,648 --> 01:11:49,857
Whatever it is, find out the phone.

1116
01:11:49,857 --> 01:11:53,273
Many important informations
are in that phone.

1117
01:11:53,273 --> 01:11:54,606
What's that?

1118
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:58,690
I'm telling you, it has many important
informations and matter.

1119
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,190
Matter? Is it about you?

1120
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,898
It was there but I deleted as
I couldn't see on my own.

1121
01:12:02,898 --> 01:12:05,273
There is an another clip.
I'll send you.

1122
01:12:05,273 --> 01:12:05,773
See here.

1123
01:12:06,648 --> 01:12:08,440
'They got caught and find it, Apple'.

1124
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:09,440
Apple?

1125
01:12:09,523 --> 01:12:10,565
'They got caught and find it, Apple'.

1126
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:12,398
What's this?
-Password.

1127
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:13,690
Is this a password?

1128
01:12:14,314 --> 01:12:16,898
If you don't find the phone,
only graveyard for you.

1129
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,231
Yes.

1130
01:12:18,231 --> 01:12:19,898
What?
-What?

1131
01:12:20,481 --> 01:12:24,398
If I don't get the phone,
I'll not rest in peace.

1132
01:12:24,398 --> 01:12:25,523
Will it get wet?

1133
01:12:25,523 --> 01:12:26,440
What?

1134
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,982
What can I do?

1135
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,732
Hit him.

1136
01:12:28,732 --> 01:12:31,523
I recommended you
as you're my cousin.

1137
01:12:31,523 --> 01:12:33,940
But, you may not go back

1138
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,440
I’ll do.

1139
01:12:35,773 --> 01:12:39,773
Brother, food is over in
the Government canteen.

1140
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:42,690
You tried for food, so far.
-Would've got if went earlier.

1141
01:12:45,565 --> 01:12:46,398
Zombie!

1142
01:12:46,398 --> 01:12:49,690
No Zombie, nothing.

1143
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,648
Let me see.

1144
01:12:51,648 --> 01:12:53,523
Did you think, I'll get afraid?

1145
01:12:53,523 --> 01:12:56,648
Zombie, If you've dignity,
face me straight.

1146
01:12:56,857 --> 01:12:59,023
Don't get down from the car.

1147
01:12:59,023 --> 01:13:00,982
What do you think of me?

1148
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:04,648
Don't get down from the car.
-Go...

1149
01:13:04,648 --> 01:13:05,815
Come on.

1150
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,231
Go...

1151
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:08,648
Why did you get down
from the car?

1152
01:13:08,648 --> 01:13:09,481
Hey, go...

1153
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:10,940
Don't make noise.

1154
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,149
The Zombies will come.

1155
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:17,690
Zombie!

1156
01:13:20,857 --> 01:13:22,023
Zombie!

1157
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,190
You're the security, right?

1158
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,857
Open the gate.

1159
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:30,023
Go...

1160
01:13:30,023 --> 01:13:33,690
Why aren't you opening the
gate when he is saying?

1161
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:34,690
It's a Zombie!

1162
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:36,565
Dude, throw the five rupees
on his face.

1163
01:13:36,565 --> 01:13:39,107
Listen me, let's move
from here, please.

1164
01:13:39,107 --> 01:13:40,523
They’ll bite us.

1165
01:13:40,815 --> 01:13:42,982
We'll go from here.

1166
01:13:42,982 --> 01:13:45,273
Hey, open the gate.

1167
01:13:45,857 --> 01:13:47,356
Hey, open the gate.

1168
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,606
He isn't opening the gate.
-Zombie.

1169
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:52,857
Get lost...

1170
01:13:55,857 --> 01:13:57,149
Dude, he is a Zombie.

1171
01:13:57,149 --> 01:13:58,273
Run away!

1172
01:13:58,273 --> 01:14:01,231
I saw him, somewhere.

1173
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:03,606
Him…

1174
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,356
He is the manager.

1175
01:14:06,356 --> 01:14:10,356
We left him to the Zombie
in the morning.

1176
01:14:10,356 --> 01:14:11,565
Yes.

1177
01:14:11,565 --> 01:14:14,314
He too became a Zombie,
it seems.

1178
01:14:14,314 --> 01:14:17,356
He became a Zombie!

1179
01:14:18,356 --> 01:14:20,023
It's a Zombie!

1180
01:14:20,815 --> 01:14:22,815
They're also Zombies!

1181
01:14:22,815 --> 01:14:23,940
Run away.

1182
01:14:26,982 --> 01:14:29,648
Show me your Aadhar card, Zombie.

1183
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,523
Sir, they don't have.

1184
01:14:31,773 --> 01:14:33,314
They're anti-Indians.
Come, let's go.

1185
01:14:33,314 --> 01:14:34,149
Come on.

1186
01:14:35,273 --> 01:14:36,107
Come on.

1187
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,273
Run away.

1188
01:14:40,273 --> 01:14:42,440
Oh, no! Zombie! Run away.

1189
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,606
Hey, come.

1190
01:14:54,398 --> 01:14:55,565
CCTV room!

1191
01:14:55,773 --> 01:14:57,314
At least, we came here.

1192
01:14:57,314 --> 01:14:58,898
Don't know where they went.

1193
01:14:59,565 --> 01:15:01,481
Let's be here, safely.

1194
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:04,107
Didn't I tell you not to get
down from the car.

1195
01:15:04,107 --> 01:15:06,231
Leaving the resort
altogether is safe for us.

1196
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,231
Just relax.

1197
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:09,231
Why are you getting tensed?

1198
01:15:09,231 --> 01:15:09,690
Cool.

1199
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,773
Let's be here, that’s safe.

1200
01:15:19,023 --> 01:15:19,815
Go inside.

1201
01:15:25,273 --> 01:15:26,732
Go away.

1202
01:15:29,231 --> 01:15:30,356
Why are you looking around?

1203
01:15:30,356 --> 01:15:32,065
Is it new washroom?
-What?

1204
01:15:32,065 --> 01:15:34,314
I need to use it, if it's new.

1205
01:15:34,314 --> 01:15:35,982
Does it look like new?

1206
01:15:35,982 --> 01:15:37,523
Have we took the token
and came here?

1207
01:15:37,523 --> 01:15:38,481
I'll hit you.

1208
01:15:38,481 --> 01:15:39,314
Just control yourself.

1209
01:15:39,314 --> 01:15:41,023
I can't.

1210
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:43,356
How can I control when
seeing the Zombies?

1211
01:15:43,356 --> 01:15:46,023
You ate heavily and blaming the Zombies.

1212
01:15:46,023 --> 01:15:47,231
I'll kill you.

1213
01:15:54,773 --> 01:15:56,732
Don't shout.
-I'll piss off.

1214
01:15:56,732 --> 01:15:57,606
Come on.

1215
01:15:58,398 --> 01:16:01,481
I don't know to use this type.
-Get inside.

1216
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:02,815
Get inside.

1217
01:16:44,314 --> 01:16:45,648
Are you weeping or breathing?

1218
01:16:45,648 --> 01:16:47,065
I'm doing both.

1219
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:48,773
I'm hungry.

1220
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:52,732
Hungry? I'll cook for you.

1221
01:16:52,732 --> 01:16:54,940
Do you know cooking?

1222
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:55,940
Why did you ask like this?

1223
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,314
I've seen many cooking programmes.

1224
01:16:57,314 --> 01:16:58,606
Cooking programmes?

1225
01:16:58,606 --> 01:17:00,732
I'll watch the whole night.

1226
01:17:00,732 --> 01:17:02,565
The whole night?

1227
01:17:02,565 --> 01:17:03,773
What will you watch?

1228
01:17:03,773 --> 01:17:04,982
Cooking Mantra, a programme.

1229
01:17:04,982 --> 01:17:10,149
Cooking mantra?

1230
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,815
Hey, damn it.

1231
01:17:10,982 --> 01:17:12,398
I'm not asking it.

1232
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,107
I'm hungry.

1233
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:14,940
Then, what?

1234
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:17,065
When Zombies are roaming.
Are you hungry?

1235
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:18,898
We're in the safest place.

1236
01:17:19,732 --> 01:17:20,314
Just a minute.

1237
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:24,314
What?

1238
01:17:26,231 --> 01:17:27,314
Look up.

1239
01:17:57,023 --> 01:17:58,398
Hey, sound I'd heard.

1240
01:18:00,023 --> 01:18:00,898
Just two minutes.

1241
01:18:00,898 --> 01:18:01,773
Hey, be quiet.

1242
01:18:04,898 --> 01:18:06,690
Be calm.
I'll go and check.

1243
01:18:28,606 --> 01:18:30,273
Five Zombies are there.

1244
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,356
Five!

1245
01:18:34,648 --> 01:18:36,065
What are you doing?

1246
01:18:36,065 --> 01:18:38,190
Just two minutes.

1247
01:18:48,065 --> 01:18:49,523
Hey, what's that?

1248
01:18:50,149 --> 01:18:51,481
I can't.

1249
01:18:51,481 --> 01:18:52,857
Zombie is better than you.

1250
01:18:59,398 --> 01:19:00,982
Pass quietly.

1251
01:19:00,982 --> 01:19:02,440
Just five minutes.

1252
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:03,356
It'll be over.

1253
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:14,273
Sir!

1254
01:19:14,273 --> 01:19:15,690
Sit.

1255
01:19:16,732 --> 01:19:17,606
What?

1256
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,149
Be patient.

1257
01:19:23,314 --> 01:19:25,398
Come on, now.

1258
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:28,356
One eye!

1259
01:19:30,273 --> 01:19:30,940
It's coming.

1260
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:31,356
Wait there.

1261
01:19:31,356 --> 01:19:31,898
What to do?

1262
01:19:32,565 --> 01:19:33,857
Wait.

1263
01:19:34,481 --> 01:19:35,732
What to do?

1264
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,690
Oh, no!

1265
01:20:08,898 --> 01:20:11,565
It came to me.

1266
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,273
Oh, no! He is hugging the Zombie.

1267
01:20:17,273 --> 01:20:18,565
Save me.

1268
01:20:21,023 --> 01:20:22,481
Good! It got skid.

1269
01:20:22,481 --> 01:20:24,732
Sir, that's it.

1270
01:20:25,356 --> 01:20:27,940
Pour the oil.
Blaze it.

1271
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,898
Make the part time Zombie
to be a full time one.

1272
01:20:29,898 --> 01:20:32,898
Pour it.

1273
01:20:33,398 --> 01:20:35,107
Fire!

1274
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:36,314
Ignite and come on.

1275
01:20:41,815 --> 01:20:43,149
Is it the time to use
the washroom?

1276
01:20:43,732 --> 01:20:44,648
Are you good enough?

1277
01:20:50,481 --> 01:20:51,565
Don't press the flush button.

1278
01:20:51,565 --> 01:20:52,314
No.

1279
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:54,481
I can't bear.

1280
01:21:02,815 --> 01:21:05,231
Either you come or not,
I'm going.

1281
01:21:13,398 --> 01:21:14,898
Hey, wash now.

1282
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,149
Come.
-Wait, I'll come.

1283
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:26,023
Come.

1284
01:21:26,606 --> 01:21:29,690
The water came lightly.
That's why, it was late.

1285
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,815
Hold it tightly.

1286
01:21:30,815 --> 01:21:31,857
That's it.

1287
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:42,149
Shall we open?

1288
01:21:45,732 --> 01:21:46,857
Did you wash?

1289
01:21:46,857 --> 01:21:48,023
Yes.

1290
01:21:48,023 --> 01:21:48,440
Come on.

1291
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,732
The Zombie might be there.

1292
01:21:52,523 --> 01:21:54,314
It's clean.
-Come on.

1293
01:21:54,314 --> 01:21:54,982
Come on.

1294
01:21:54,982 --> 01:21:56,940
Come on.

1295
01:21:57,231 --> 01:21:57,857
Come slowly.

1296
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:01,648
Don't know where the Zombies
are going around.

1297
01:22:39,648 --> 01:22:41,481
Hello! What?

1298
01:22:43,481 --> 01:22:45,815
Nothing, just looking at.

1299
01:22:47,356 --> 01:22:48,857
Control yourself, Goutham.

1300
01:22:58,481 --> 01:23:00,606
Hey!

1301
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:03,065
I called as 'sir'.

1302
01:23:03,065 --> 01:23:04,815
In hunger, you might've heard as 'hey.'

1303
01:23:04,815 --> 01:23:06,023
Did you call me as,'hey'?

1304
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,982
As you heard as 'hey' I called
you as 'hey' to check.

1305
01:23:07,982 --> 01:23:09,565
That's why, it's 'hey'.

1306
01:23:09,565 --> 01:23:10,356
Then, what sir?

1307
01:23:10,356 --> 01:23:11,815
You people are moving on.

1308
01:23:11,815 --> 01:23:14,565
Yes, everyone is moving as pair.

1309
01:23:14,565 --> 01:23:15,565
What to do?

1310
01:23:15,565 --> 01:23:16,440
You said, exactly.

1311
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,940
Goutham has escaped
with a beautiful girl.

1312
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,314
My pair looks ugly.

1313
01:23:21,314 --> 01:23:23,314
Looks ugly.
-I'd have stayed in home.

1314
01:23:23,314 --> 01:23:25,314
Hey, phone!

1315
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:26,149
Phone!

1316
01:23:29,815 --> 01:23:30,440
Button lock.

1317
01:23:31,982 --> 01:23:32,606
Finger lock.

1318
01:23:33,982 --> 01:23:34,565
Face lock.

1319
01:23:35,023 --> 01:23:35,940
Lip lock.

1320
01:23:36,565 --> 01:23:37,940
Sir, what are you doing?

1321
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,523
Nowadays, the phones are given, locked.

1322
01:23:39,523 --> 01:23:40,565
You can't do anything with it.
Throw the phone and come.

1323
01:23:40,565 --> 01:23:41,314
What to do?

1324
01:23:41,314 --> 01:23:43,648
We've the oil.
let's save by ourselves with it.

1325
01:23:43,648 --> 01:23:44,107
Okay, come.

1326
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:44,606
Go..

1327
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,898
My mother-in-law told not to go.

1328
01:23:46,898 --> 01:23:47,982
Did I obey her?

1329
01:23:47,982 --> 01:23:49,440
Go fastly.
-Come on.

1330
01:23:55,773 --> 01:23:56,523
What?

1331
01:23:56,523 --> 01:23:56,982
Zombie!

1332
01:23:56,982 --> 01:23:57,940
We’ll run the other side, come.

1333
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,606
Even in upstairs, Zombie is there.
-Come on.

1334
01:24:02,356 --> 01:24:03,190
What?

1335
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:03,940
Nothing.

1336
01:24:15,398 --> 01:24:16,857
It's gone.

1337
01:24:16,857 --> 01:24:18,732
Why to take risk?
Pour the oil.

1338
01:24:18,732 --> 01:24:19,857
Wait
-Go..Go…

1339
01:24:23,732 --> 01:24:24,481
I'll pour.

1340
01:24:25,149 --> 01:24:25,773
Pouring...

1341
01:24:27,356 --> 01:24:29,440
Pour it in the side.

1342
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:30,565
Pour it in the other side.

1343
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,523
Pour thoroughly.
-Wait, I'm pouring.

1344
01:24:32,523 --> 01:24:33,732
Come.

1345
01:24:33,732 --> 01:24:34,940
He is getting work from me.

1346
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:38,523
What’s that?

1347
01:24:43,314 --> 01:24:45,398
See, who is that?

1348
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:49,523
Oh! my god!

1349
01:24:49,523 --> 01:24:51,023
What is that sound?

1350
01:24:51,023 --> 01:24:52,815
See.

1351
01:24:52,815 --> 01:24:55,356
It's skidding.

1352
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:56,940
Our boys.

1353
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:57,773
Come on.

1354
01:24:59,273 --> 01:25:01,690
Lift me.

1355
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:03,481
Don't push me.

1356
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:05,857
Come this side.

1357
01:25:07,273 --> 01:25:10,815
Dude, are you alive still?

1358
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:11,773
Yes, we're alive.

1359
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,107
I struggled very much
to see you all.

1360
01:25:14,107 --> 01:25:19,190
Some idiot has
poured the oil here.

1361
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:20,773
It's me, poured it.

1362
01:25:20,773 --> 01:25:22,815
I've poured for
Zombie to skid.

1363
01:25:24,773 --> 01:25:26,898
Hold me and take.

1364
01:25:26,898 --> 01:25:28,940
Did you booze in between?

1365
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:30,523
Let's be together.

1366
01:25:30,648 --> 01:25:31,314
Yes, dude.

1367
01:25:38,023 --> 01:25:39,565
Goutham! Come here.

1368
01:25:39,565 --> 01:25:40,356
I'm coming.

1369
01:25:41,314 --> 01:25:42,149
Look here.

1370
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:43,149
What?

1371
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:45,065
Look down.

1372
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,314
Trampoline.

1373
01:25:46,314 --> 01:25:49,149
We'll use it to jump out of the
compound to escape.

1374
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:50,398
Will it happen?

1375
01:25:50,398 --> 01:25:51,982
I think being here is safe.

1376
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,523
I'm going, will you come or not?

1377
01:25:55,732 --> 01:25:57,190
Okay, just two minutes.

1378
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,815
I'll check whether
my friends are coming.

1379
01:25:58,815 --> 01:25:59,565
Okay? Wait.

1380
01:25:59,565 --> 01:26:00,314
Hey, stop.

1381
01:26:04,014 --> 01:26:05,639
Come, quiet.

1382
01:26:10,973 --> 01:26:12,014
The HOD oldey is here.

1383
01:26:12,014 --> 01:26:12,889
Where?

1384
01:26:12,889 --> 01:26:15,305
She isn't an oldey.

1385
01:26:15,305 --> 01:26:16,556
But, Zombie granny.
-Zombie!

1386
01:26:16,556 --> 01:26:17,681
Then, we'll thrash them.

1387
01:26:17,681 --> 01:26:21,180
Hey, guys! Relax!
I told you so politely.

1388
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,514
Sir, listen us.
It's an unwanted issue.

1389
01:26:22,514 --> 01:26:23,556
Hey, I know.

1390
01:26:23,556 --> 01:26:25,389
All my company employees
will roam like this in the night.

1391
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:26,389
Sir, no...
That's different, sir.

1392
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:28,806
I'm a professional, who speaks politely.
-Don't go, sir.

1393
01:26:28,806 --> 01:26:32,514
Excuse me, I like to have
a discussion with you.

1394
01:26:33,138 --> 01:26:35,639
Mam, my name is 'MSD'.
I’m a businessman.

1395
01:26:35,639 --> 01:26:37,430
Do you know
what's happening inside?

1396
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:39,597
Your students are idiots.

1397
01:26:39,597 --> 01:26:41,138
Highly irresponsible.

1398
01:26:41,138 --> 01:26:43,973
They are drinking blood
in the bottles.

1399
01:26:43,973 --> 01:26:48,138
You're keen to find the angles
for the selfie.

1400
01:26:48,138 --> 01:26:49,639
Dude, she is also a lunatic.

1401
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:51,430
Let's watch both
biting each other,.

1402
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:53,347
Hold the hands steadily.
Why it's shaking?

1403
01:26:55,806 --> 01:27:01,138
Save me.

1404
01:27:01,138 --> 01:27:04,597
Leave him.
Hey, no!

1405
01:27:04,597 --> 01:27:06,347
Take the stone.

1406
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:07,847
Leave him.

1407
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:10,305
Go aside, Zombie granny.
Don't bite the leg.

1408
01:27:10,305 --> 01:27:11,889
Push her.

1409
01:27:11,889 --> 01:27:13,264
Come on.

1410
01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:15,556
Run away.

1411
01:27:15,556 --> 01:27:16,681
All the Zombies came.

1412
01:27:26,514 --> 01:27:28,180
Ishwarya, come soon.

1413
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,138
Are you going to come or not?

1414
01:27:29,138 --> 01:27:31,055
Look there, my friends!

1415
01:27:33,764 --> 01:27:36,222
They're coming towards us.
Come on, soon.

1416
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:37,889
My god!

1417
01:27:37,889 --> 01:27:39,180
Hey, wait.
Let them join us.

1418
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:42,222
Keep walking.

1419
01:27:43,764 --> 01:27:45,305
Come here.

1420
01:27:45,305 --> 01:27:46,764
Hey, Goutham!

1421
01:27:47,264 --> 01:27:49,347
Goutham, save us.

1422
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:50,514
Lift me.

1423
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:52,681
Somehow, we've to escape.

1424
01:27:53,014 --> 01:27:54,347
Oh, no! They're chasing.

1425
01:27:54,347 --> 01:27:55,556
Save us.

1426
01:27:58,556 --> 01:27:59,389
Come on, sir.
-Come fast.

1427
01:27:59,389 --> 01:28:01,597
Guys, stop.

1428
01:28:01,597 --> 01:28:03,806
Go that way.
-Get inside.

1429
01:28:03,806 --> 01:28:05,347
Come soon...

1430
01:28:06,264 --> 01:28:09,639
Let's go inside.
-Go...

1431
01:28:09,639 --> 01:28:13,931
Hurry up.
Let's go inside.

1432
01:28:13,931 --> 01:28:14,681
Get inside.

1433
01:28:14,681 --> 01:28:15,639
Close the door.

1434
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:20,931
This is the perfect place,
let's settle here.

1435
01:28:20,931 --> 01:28:22,806
Let's go near the window.

1436
01:28:22,806 --> 01:28:23,847
They've come.

1437
01:28:25,389 --> 01:28:26,472
Hey, Zombie!

1438
01:28:26,472 --> 01:28:28,347
It's definitely not the perfect place.

1439
01:28:28,347 --> 01:28:31,556
Lift it.

1440
01:28:32,889 --> 01:28:34,347
Leave it.

1441
01:28:36,931 --> 01:28:37,806
Be careful.

1442
01:28:40,347 --> 01:28:41,931
Don't leave.

1443
01:28:44,681 --> 01:28:47,180
We've a way to escape.
-Balance properly.

1444
01:28:47,264 --> 01:28:48,973
Press hard.

1445
01:28:48,973 --> 01:28:51,681
Why are you pushing me?
-Don't leave.

1446
01:28:51,847 --> 01:28:53,014
It came here too.

1447
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:55,389
Philips brother!

1448
01:28:55,389 --> 01:28:57,014
Tell me, sister.
-Come here.

1449
01:28:57,514 --> 01:28:58,389
Go.

1450
01:28:58,764 --> 01:29:00,514
Only if you let me free,
I can go.

1451
01:29:00,597 --> 01:29:01,347
Go.

1452
01:29:02,556 --> 01:29:03,514
Brother, Jump now.

1453
01:29:03,514 --> 01:29:04,806
In this?
-Yes!

1454
01:29:06,347 --> 01:29:07,639
Jump now.
-It's too deep.

1455
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:09,305
It's okay, jump.

1456
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,097
Should I jump for sure?
-Yes.

1457
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:16,222
Are you sure?
-Hey, jump!

1458
01:29:21,347 --> 01:29:22,180
Hey, he jumped.

1459
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:25,014
There must be a way to escape.
I'll go, dude.

1460
01:29:26,305 --> 01:29:28,430
Oh, no! More Zombies are standing here.
-Jump!

1461
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:30,097
If slipped, I'm done!

1462
01:29:30,097 --> 01:29:31,597
I'm afraid of height.

1463
01:29:31,597 --> 01:29:32,514
Oh, no! It's okay.

1464
01:29:32,514 --> 01:29:36,806
Jump now.
-Sakthimaan! Save me!

1465
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:38,305
Take care of sir.

1466
01:29:38,305 --> 01:29:39,556
Jump.

1467
01:29:39,556 --> 01:29:41,055
Shall we both
jump together, please?

1468
01:29:41,055 --> 01:29:42,305
Hey, goof! Jump.

1469
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:44,389
Will you follow me?

1470
01:29:47,472 --> 01:29:48,722
Good jump!

1471
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:50,180
Chinnathambi! I'll jump the next.

1472
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:52,389
Both of you escape, somehow.
-Somehow?

1473
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:54,097
I'm caught.

1474
01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:00,681
Excellent jump!

1475
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:04,014
Sir, only two of us are left.

1476
01:30:04,014 --> 01:30:06,014
One must leave and the
other have to stay back.

1477
01:30:07,264 --> 01:30:08,347
Don't leave me.

1478
01:30:08,347 --> 01:30:09,639
Sir, are you going
or shall I go?

1479
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:11,097
I don't know.

1480
01:30:12,556 --> 01:30:13,305
It's broken.

1481
01:30:13,305 --> 01:30:16,347
I'll make the last.
I'll take care.

1482
01:30:19,055 --> 01:30:20,222
Go...

1483
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,597
Escape, Chinnathambi.

1484
01:30:22,847 --> 01:30:24,806
Escape.

1485
01:30:32,097 --> 01:30:34,639
Brother!

1486
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:38,180
Save me!

1487
01:30:40,305 --> 01:30:43,430
Forgive me!

1488
01:30:44,097 --> 01:30:46,264
For past one hour I keep walking,
nobody is bothered.

1489
01:30:46,264 --> 01:30:48,138
Look at his moss.

1490
01:30:48,305 --> 01:30:49,931
You're diabetic, right?
Keep walking with me.

1491
01:30:51,055 --> 01:30:51,806
What happened?

1492
01:30:52,222 --> 01:30:54,347
I'm feeling sleepy.

1493
01:30:54,347 --> 01:30:55,514
Get me tea.

1494
01:30:55,514 --> 01:30:56,514
It's 2 o'clock.

1495
01:30:56,514 --> 01:30:57,639
The shop must be closed.

1496
01:30:57,639 --> 01:30:58,889
You prepare it.

1497
01:30:59,264 --> 01:31:00,847
I'm habitual of only hitting,
is it okay?

1498
01:31:00,847 --> 01:31:03,138
I'm drinking warm water
and roaming..

1499
01:31:03,305 --> 01:31:04,681
Why are you making
our family ashame?

1500
01:31:04,681 --> 01:31:05,556
Do the work, properly.

1501
01:31:05,556 --> 01:31:06,722
Shut up.

1502
01:31:06,722 --> 01:31:07,764
I'll hit you.

1503
01:31:07,764 --> 01:31:08,931
I feel giddy, shall I stop?

1504
01:31:08,931 --> 01:31:10,514
No, walk till you die.

1505
01:31:11,847 --> 01:31:12,889
Got it!!

1506
01:31:13,472 --> 01:31:14,597
Got the cellphone?

1507
01:31:14,889 --> 01:31:18,347
For long time,
a mosquito was disturbing me.

1508
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:19,347
More blood.

1509
01:31:19,347 --> 01:31:22,430
For his mistakes,
his father is going to die.

1510
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:24,138
Why are you killing your
father for givin-> 00:04:09,584
Sir, are you going

More blood.

1541
01:31:19,347 --> 01:31:22,430

Leave me.

1544
01:32:26,847 --> 01:32:27,722
Tell me, officer.

1545
01:32:27,722 --> 01:32:32,806
Tracing Pistol Raj phone shows it was
switched off in Marakkanam, last evening.

1546
01:32:32,806 --> 01:32:35,847
If the phone is switched on,
we can trace out the exact location.

1547
01:32:38,722 --> 01:32:40,889
Pistol, are you in Marakkanam?

1548
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:42,681
Death is nearing you.

1549
01:32:45,014 --> 01:32:45,847
Come on.

1550
01:32:45,847 --> 01:32:46,681
Escape.

1551
01:32:46,681 --> 01:32:47,597
Come on, everybody.

1552
01:32:47,597 --> 01:32:48,472
Come on.

1553
01:32:48,472 --> 01:32:49,347
Come on, everybody.

1554
01:32:49,347 --> 01:32:50,180
Hurry up.

1555
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:50,847
Just nearby.

1556
01:32:51,472 --> 01:32:55,305
Come on.

1557
01:32:55,305 --> 01:32:56,138
Escape.

1558
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:01,097
All girls!

1559
01:33:01,097 --> 01:33:01,973
What's this!

1560
01:33:01,973 --> 01:33:03,556
Let's go.

1561
01:33:09,347 --> 01:33:13,180
We didn't go out of
the resort, yet.

1562
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:17,597
Oh, no! did you made to jump high,
do gymnastics and Olympics for this?

1563
01:33:17,597 --> 01:33:19,014
So, no exit?

1564
01:33:20,264 --> 01:33:21,430
What to do, now?

1565
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:24,222
Can we play, jumping again?

1566
01:33:24,222 --> 01:33:25,389
Please, don't shout.

1567
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:26,264
We're trapped!

1568
01:33:26,264 --> 01:33:27,264
We're trapped on the whole.

1569
01:33:27,389 --> 01:33:29,472
No other way.

1570
01:33:29,931 --> 01:33:30,847
We're going to die.

1571
01:33:30,847 --> 01:33:32,764
Yes, we're going to die.

1572
01:33:32,764 --> 01:33:33,931
We're trapped!

1573
01:33:33,931 --> 01:33:35,264
And going to die.

1574
01:33:35,264 --> 01:33:36,639
Getting thrashed by the Zombies,

1575
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:37,931
We're going to transform
as Zombies.

1576
01:33:37,931 --> 01:33:39,055
Going to transform as Zombies.

1577
01:33:39,055 --> 01:33:40,055
It's over!

1578
01:33:40,055 --> 01:33:41,055
Everything is over.

1579
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:41,514
Be quiet.

1580
01:33:41,514 --> 01:33:43,597
He is blabbering now.

1581
01:33:43,597 --> 01:33:46,014
He is also going
to be a Zombie.

1582
01:33:46,014 --> 01:33:48,722
Drunkard, caught for the greed
to booze and eat grill chicken.

1583
01:33:48,722 --> 01:33:50,014
You're going to become a Zombie.

1584
01:33:50,014 --> 01:33:53,889
Yeah, I was frustrated
but he took me there.

1585
01:33:53,889 --> 01:33:55,973
Yes, I too was frustrated.

1586
01:33:55,973 --> 01:33:57,389
I'm going to transform as a Zombie.

1587
01:33:57,389 --> 01:34:05,973
No way to escape from here.

1588
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:07,472
Did Zombie bite him?

1589
01:34:07,472 --> 01:34:08,931
Lightly, it did.

1590
01:34:10,097 --> 01:34:12,180
Leave it.
-Don't shout.

1591
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,138
Think well.

1592
01:34:13,138 --> 01:34:14,472
No, you don't think.

1593
01:34:14,472 --> 01:34:17,389
You think.

1594
01:34:17,389 --> 01:34:18,347
The cellphones were stuck
in the room.

1595
01:34:18,347 --> 01:34:20,597
The car keys is with the Zombie.

1596
01:34:20,597 --> 01:34:21,347
So, no exit.

1597
01:34:21,347 --> 01:34:22,430
Only death situation.

1598
01:34:23,597 --> 01:34:24,389
Hey, an idea!

1599
01:34:24,389 --> 01:34:25,180
What to do?

1600
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,847
He has become a lunatic.

1601
01:34:26,847 --> 01:34:27,931
Think well, brother.

1602
01:34:27,931 --> 01:34:29,264
I can think, only if I booze.

1603
01:34:29,264 --> 01:34:31,097
Drunkard, think of something.

1604
01:34:32,764 --> 01:34:33,764
We're going to die.

1605
01:34:33,764 --> 01:34:35,055
We're going to change
as Zombies.

1606
01:34:36,597 --> 01:34:38,138
We all must change
as Zombies.

1607
01:34:38,138 --> 01:34:38,889
Change as Zombie?

1608
01:34:38,889 --> 01:34:40,138
Good! That's right.

1609
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:41,222
What's right?

1610
01:34:41,222 --> 01:34:43,305
Will you say everything as right
just to please her?

1611
01:34:43,305 --> 01:34:43,722
Hey!

1612
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:46,973
Do we must change as Zombie
after getting hurt by it?

1613
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:52,264
No, we've to act as Zombies,
except one of us.

1614
01:34:52,264 --> 01:34:56,472
He must be locked in the room
and we all should escape following him.

1615
01:34:56,472 --> 01:34:57,806
Exactly! She is right.

1616
01:34:57,806 --> 01:34:59,597
Yeah, he is a method actor.

1617
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:02,514
He'll escape as planned.

1618
01:35:02,514 --> 01:35:06,014
Hey, no other way for us
to escape.

1619
01:35:06,014 --> 01:35:07,097
Please, understand.

1620
01:35:07,097 --> 01:35:07,931
The plan is okay.

1621
01:35:07,931 --> 01:35:09,597
Who is going to be human?

1622
01:35:09,597 --> 01:35:11,264
Who?

1623
01:35:12,222 --> 01:35:12,973
Myself?

1624
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:19,931
Dear, you're going to see
the excellent scene, hereafter.

1625
01:35:19,931 --> 01:35:21,973
Don't know whether to believe him?

1626
01:35:21,973 --> 01:35:22,931
Okay, let's go.

1627
01:35:22,931 --> 01:35:25,430
Wait, we can't go like this.

1628
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:26,222
Then?

1629
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:30,347
What happened?
-Tell me, boss.

1630
01:35:31,556 --> 01:35:32,722
Why have you covered
the face with scarf?

1631
01:35:32,722 --> 01:35:34,556
Am I recruiting people?

1632
01:35:34,556 --> 01:35:37,055
They're behaving rudely.

1633
01:35:37,055 --> 01:35:38,556
Nobody is saying the truth.

1634
01:35:38,556 --> 01:35:40,097
I'll tell the truth, brother.

1635
01:35:40,097 --> 01:35:40,597
What?

1636
01:35:40,597 --> 01:35:42,138
I removed the stenchy shoes.

1637
01:35:42,430 --> 01:35:44,097
Wastrel.

1638
01:35:44,264 --> 01:35:45,931
Boss, he won't work out.

1639
01:35:45,931 --> 01:35:47,556
He is repeating the same.

1640
01:35:47,556 --> 01:35:55,806
We're going to Pondicherry at a
stretch and enjoy everything.

1641
01:35:55,806 --> 01:36:00,305
If I bang you,
you'll go up and never come down.

1642
01:36:00,305 --> 01:36:00,847
Shut your mouth and drive.

1643
01:36:00,847 --> 01:36:02,014
I'm also saying the same.

1644
01:36:02,014 --> 01:36:02,514
What?

1645
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:05,347
If you close the window
and switch on AC, we can enjoy the trip.

1646
01:36:05,347 --> 01:36:06,722
Pound his mouth.

1647
01:36:06,931 --> 01:36:09,264
We've opened the windows,
due to lack of fuel.

1648
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:10,180
I'm ready.

1649
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:12,180
Do you've any better idea?

1650
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:13,847
What about you, brother?

1651
01:36:13,847 --> 01:36:16,264
I don't have anything.
-Shut up, then.

1652
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:50,556
Put the shawl.

1653
01:37:25,681 --> 01:37:27,305
Keep quiet.

1654
01:37:27,305 --> 01:37:28,514
Don't laugh.

1655
01:37:34,931 --> 01:37:36,556
'I'm a black and white King'

1656
01:37:36,556 --> 01:37:37,764
'And a rose to adore'.

1657
01:37:37,764 --> 01:37:41,055
My love!

1658
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:42,514
What's this?

1659
01:37:42,514 --> 01:37:44,722
I'll hit you.

1660
01:37:44,722 --> 01:37:45,764
Be careful.

1661
01:37:45,973 --> 01:37:48,305
He is yearning for her.

1662
01:37:49,347 --> 01:37:50,180
Where is he?

1663
01:38:01,973 --> 01:38:02,806
Oh, no!

1664
01:38:04,222 --> 01:38:04,639
Damn!

1665
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:07,264
Our disguise is better.
-Yes.

1666
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:16,430
Sir, is it comfortable?

1667
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:18,305
Will you wear it to check
how comfortable it is?

1668
01:38:18,305 --> 01:38:19,597
Hey, shut up.

1669
01:38:19,597 --> 01:38:21,389
Okay, what to do now?

1670
01:38:21,931 --> 01:38:23,097
The costumes are okay.

1671
01:38:23,097 --> 01:38:24,138
I'll tell you what to do next.

1672
01:38:24,138 --> 01:38:25,138
Come, let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

1673
01:38:25,138 --> 01:38:26,305
Won't she say that here?

1674
01:38:26,305 --> 01:38:27,639
She might've find a place somewhere.
-Okay.

1675
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:28,389
Is there water?

1676
01:38:28,472 --> 01:38:29,180
I found it.

1677
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:29,806
What?

1678
01:38:30,097 --> 01:38:32,931
Turn the vehicle.

1679
01:38:32,931 --> 01:38:35,222
Boss, there is a resort in two kilometres.

1680
01:38:35,222 --> 01:38:37,097
The Google location is pinned there.

1681
01:38:37,097 --> 01:38:38,556
Is it?
-If we go there, we can get him.

1682
01:38:38,847 --> 01:38:39,681
Good!

1683
01:38:39,681 --> 01:38:41,597
Take U-turn.

1684
01:38:41,597 --> 01:38:43,055
Here is the bridge!

1685
01:38:43,055 --> 01:38:45,389
Don't mind the road, go ahead.

1686
01:38:45,389 --> 01:38:47,014
Don't we know about our contractors?

1687
01:38:52,222 --> 01:38:53,305
Guys, come.

1688
01:38:53,556 --> 01:38:55,055
Hey, come.

1689
01:38:57,764 --> 01:38:59,347
Hey, leave it down.

1690
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:05,430
Guys, we've seen many Zombies…

1691
01:39:05,681 --> 01:39:08,347
…and know about their body language.

1692
01:39:08,347 --> 01:39:11,014
Now, you do the same.
I'll check.

1693
01:39:11,014 --> 01:39:12,097
I'll do.
-Will you?

1694
01:39:12,097 --> 01:39:13,347
Look here.

1695
01:39:13,347 --> 01:39:14,347
He'll perform well.

1696
01:39:14,347 --> 01:39:23,014
Look, if the Zombie comes,
I must hold my hand like this.

1697
01:39:26,764 --> 01:39:27,264
Stop it.

1698
01:39:27,264 --> 01:39:29,222
No, not like that.

1699
01:39:30,597 --> 01:39:32,097
You shouldn't do so.

1700
01:39:32,097 --> 01:39:34,597
The Zombies have their own
body language.

1701
01:39:34,597 --> 01:39:36,556
You need observation skills.

1702
01:39:36,556 --> 01:39:38,806
Do you understand?
What you must do is...

1703
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,597
The hand is more important.

1704
01:39:40,806 --> 01:39:42,597
You shouldn't lift the hand.

1705
01:39:42,722 --> 01:39:48,014
That's right.
The hand must extend up to this.

1706
01:39:48,347 --> 01:39:49,514
Turn immediately.

1707
01:39:49,514 --> 01:39:50,681
Don't be afraid.

1708
01:39:50,681 --> 01:39:51,681
You shouldn't get afraid for this.

1709
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:58,847
Keep it like this and lift the back.

1710
01:39:58,847 --> 01:40:00,639
What are you doing?

1711
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:02,430
We're trapped with the Zombies.

1712
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:03,931
You aren't serious.

1713
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:05,973
Zombies have an attitude.

1714
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:11,014
Like Kabaddi...Kabaddi...

1715
01:40:11,014 --> 01:40:12,055
Why are you saying as 'Kabbadi'?

1716
01:40:12,055 --> 01:40:13,764
Okay. Then...
-You're pranking.

1717
01:40:13,847 --> 01:40:16,180
Shut up.

1718
01:40:16,514 --> 01:40:18,889
I'll show you the Zombie walk.

1719
01:40:18,889 --> 01:40:20,514
Watch me, babes.

1720
01:40:23,472 --> 01:40:25,556
What?
-He took both.

1721
01:40:34,514 --> 01:40:35,639
How is it?

1722
01:40:35,889 --> 01:40:37,138
It's like a lustful Zombie.

1723
01:40:37,722 --> 01:40:39,347
Struggling with you all.

1724
01:40:39,639 --> 01:40:41,722
I'll teach you how to do.

1725
01:40:41,722 --> 01:40:43,180
Just watch me.
-Okay.

1726
01:40:50,014 --> 01:40:51,681
This Zombie!

1727
01:40:51,681 --> 01:40:53,014
No, that one.

1728
01:40:53,014 --> 01:40:53,806
Is it okay?

1729
01:40:53,806 --> 01:40:56,931
We're going to mingle with the Zombies,
raising sounds and escape.

1730
01:40:56,931 --> 01:40:57,389
Come on.

1731
01:40:57,389 --> 01:40:59,264
One...two...three...

1732
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:13,389
Be careful. Do properly.
Don't mess up.

1733
01:41:17,514 --> 01:41:19,014
Oh, no!

1734
01:41:31,347 --> 01:41:35,556
Hey, be careful.
-I'm following only you.

1735
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:37,097
Don't know
when I'm going to mess up.

1736
01:41:40,389 --> 01:41:41,556
Oh, is she!

1737
01:41:41,556 --> 01:41:44,514
Mistakenly, I fell in love with her.

1738
01:41:44,514 --> 01:41:45,764
Take diversion.

1739
01:41:46,472 --> 01:41:47,597
It's coming close.

1740
01:41:47,597 --> 01:41:49,889
Don't be afraid.
Come on.

1741
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:54,222
Oh, no! We're dancing in the
midst of Zombies.

1742
01:41:59,347 --> 01:42:01,806
Don't know what is he doing?

1743
01:42:01,806 --> 01:42:03,681
He said about timing.

1744
01:42:03,931 --> 01:42:06,138
Where is Philips?

1745
01:42:09,264 --> 01:42:12,681
I'm  Kanchana, coming to play.

1746
01:42:12,681 --> 01:42:14,681
Where are you going like
Kanchana 5 sequel?

1747
01:42:14,681 --> 01:42:17,138
Somehow, save me.

1748
01:42:18,847 --> 01:42:21,722
What are you doing?
Go that way.

1749
01:42:21,722 --> 01:42:23,722
Don't know where I'm going?

1750
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:32,556
It's heard.

1751
01:42:34,097 --> 01:42:38,055
Hello, sir! He has given the signal.
Heard the bell sound.

1752
01:42:38,055 --> 01:42:39,430
Nothing.

1753
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:41,514
It's heard well.

1754
01:42:41,514 --> 01:42:43,556
Didn't put anything inside.

1755
01:42:44,806 --> 01:42:46,430
Is that sound?

1756
01:42:46,597 --> 01:42:48,639
Put in silent mode and come.

1757
01:42:55,847 --> 01:42:56,847
Hey, you...

1758
01:42:57,014 --> 01:43:00,055
Even when disguised as Zombie,
you go behind her.

1759
01:43:00,055 --> 01:43:01,639
Is it fair?

1760
01:43:09,264 --> 01:43:10,556
Be careful.

1761
01:43:31,264 --> 01:43:33,556
Definitely, it's the signal of Philips.

1762
01:43:33,556 --> 01:43:35,514
Let's follow the Zombies.
Come on.

1763
01:43:35,514 --> 01:43:37,597
Follow the Zombie walk.
Hurry up, come on.

1764
01:43:37,597 --> 01:43:39,514
Don't overtake the Zombie,
in hurry.

1765
01:44:03,138 --> 01:44:04,514
Hey, come soon.

1766
01:44:19,180 --> 01:44:22,014
Oh, no!
Philips is no more I think.

1767
01:44:24,806 --> 01:44:26,180
Let him die.

1768
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:27,305
We'll escape.

1769
01:44:27,847 --> 01:44:29,305
Are you sure
he won't come out?

1770
01:44:31,222 --> 01:44:33,138
It's confirmed, he is dead.

1771
01:44:33,264 --> 01:44:35,014
Philips is dead.

1772
01:44:36,097 --> 01:44:37,472
He is dead, it seems!

1773
01:45:15,233 --> 01:45:17,483
This is the wrong matter.

1774
01:45:18,358 --> 01:45:19,774
Bye!

1775
01:45:24,317 --> 01:45:28,483
Hey! superb!
you are back!

1776
01:45:55,774 --> 01:45:57,816
You shouldn't have long tress.

1777
01:45:57,816 --> 01:45:59,275
It pushes you aside.

1778
01:46:02,275 --> 01:46:03,317
Arrogant.

1779
01:46:06,733 --> 01:46:08,900
Are you having the pistol?

1780
01:46:09,442 --> 01:46:11,317
Yes.
-I’m searching in the jeep.

1781
01:46:11,317 --> 01:46:12,609
Are you crazy?

1782
01:46:12,609 --> 01:46:14,650
I'm having it,
you're searching in the jeep.

1783
01:46:14,858 --> 01:46:15,483
Hey, give me.

1784
01:46:15,691 --> 01:46:16,150
Take it.

1785
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:17,733
I have seen them
somewhere.

1786
01:46:17,733 --> 01:46:22,025
Brother, they're the clan
who brawled with us in the bar.

1787
01:46:22,025 --> 01:46:23,733
Are they?

1788
01:46:23,733 --> 01:46:27,275
Kannamapet Philips,

1789
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:31,025
if you don't give me the phone
you took in the bar,

1790
01:46:31,025 --> 01:46:33,108
I'll shoot you all.

1791
01:46:33,108 --> 01:46:34,025
Fatso!
-What?

1792
01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:35,691
Be quiet. I'm threatening them.

1793
01:46:35,691 --> 01:46:37,525
It doesn't look like that.
-Shut up.

1794
01:46:37,858 --> 01:46:38,609
Give the phone.

1795
01:46:38,609 --> 01:46:40,442
Sir, he took the phone.

1796
01:46:40,442 --> 01:46:41,650
We aren't connected to it.

1797
01:46:41,650 --> 01:46:43,609
Philips!
-Brother, I took it by mistake.

1798
01:46:43,609 --> 01:46:45,192
Please, forgive us.

1799
01:46:45,192 --> 01:46:46,941
Hey, why are you joining us?

1800
01:46:46,941 --> 01:46:48,150
Ask him to forgive only you.

1801
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:50,650
He looks like the antagonist
in the film, Aaru

1802
01:46:50,650 --> 01:46:52,025
He'll let you free.

1803
01:46:52,358 --> 01:46:54,025
I thought he'll say as
'Vikram Vedha antagonist'...

1804
01:46:54,025 --> 01:46:55,233
...but teasing you.

1805
01:46:55,233 --> 01:46:56,483
I too thought the same.

1806
01:46:56,816 --> 01:46:59,900
Whom are you teasing?

1807
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:01,816
I'll ruin you.

1808
01:47:01,816 --> 01:47:04,275
Sir! It'll be a big problem
if we speak here.

1809
01:47:04,275 --> 01:47:05,442
Let's go out and speak.

1810
01:47:05,442 --> 01:47:10,609
Brother! It seems to be wrong
when looking at this place and these people.

1811
01:47:10,941 --> 01:47:12,650
I don't think so.

1812
01:47:12,858 --> 01:47:15,108
If it's wrong to you,
shut up and get lost.

1813
01:47:15,108 --> 01:47:16,900
We're doing right.

1814
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:17,816
Okay, brother.
-Go away.

1815
01:47:17,816 --> 01:47:18,275
Leave it, brother.

1816
01:47:18,275 --> 01:47:20,192
Sir, let's leave this place, immediately.

1817
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,900
Zombies are here.
-Yes, sir.

1818
01:47:23,025 --> 01:47:24,774
Zombie?
What's that?

1819
01:47:24,774 --> 01:47:26,483
That must be a name of the dog.

1820
01:47:26,691 --> 01:47:28,774
Look here, 'Big Boss Babe'...

1821
01:47:28,774 --> 01:47:33,900
Any dog will run away
if heard my name 'Pistol Raj'

1822
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:35,650
This dog is nothing.

1823
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:37,442
Ask it to come before me,
if dare enough.

1824
01:47:37,442 --> 01:47:39,858
Get dry biscuits for the dog.
-I don't have money.

1825
01:47:40,733 --> 01:47:42,733
It's not lucky enough
to eat the dry biscuits.

1826
01:47:42,733 --> 01:47:43,733
Ask it to come.

1827
01:47:43,733 --> 01:47:46,233
Sir, a Zombie is the mixing of a human
and an animal.

1828
01:47:46,233 --> 01:47:48,483
If it bites us, we too...

1829
01:47:49,525 --> 01:47:51,774
Who has locked the door?

1830
01:47:51,941 --> 01:47:53,567
Let me see, open the door.
-Listen me,

1831
01:47:53,567 --> 01:47:54,317
What?

1832
01:47:54,858 --> 01:47:55,983
A Zombie is here.

1833
01:47:55,983 --> 01:47:57,108
Run away.

1834
01:47:57,233 --> 01:47:58,066
Who is he?

1835
01:47:58,066 --> 01:47:59,941
Looking like a partially molested victim.

1836
01:48:00,108 --> 01:48:02,025
You're scaring me saying as Zombie.

1837
01:48:02,025 --> 01:48:04,066
Who is the Zombie?
Ask him to come.

1838
01:48:04,066 --> 01:48:05,358
Uninitiated fools.

1839
01:48:05,358 --> 01:48:06,858
Do you know what a Zombie bite is?

1840
01:48:06,858 --> 01:48:07,983
It'll make you half dead.

1841
01:48:07,983 --> 01:48:09,233
You'll become parasites.

1842
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:10,983
You fools! You've no idea
what blood sucking parasites are?

1843
01:48:10,983 --> 01:48:12,858
Hey, you bulb faced...

1844
01:48:13,108 --> 01:48:16,442
He is the only guy,
yelled me in all the languages.

1845
01:48:16,733 --> 01:48:19,275
I'll shoot him, first.
Get it.

1846
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:22,317
Don't shoot high
and be fooled.

1847
01:48:22,317 --> 01:48:23,066
Shoot down.

1848
01:48:23,066 --> 01:48:23,983
Thank you.

1849
01:48:23,983 --> 01:48:24,858
First shot.

1850
01:48:24,858 --> 01:48:28,150
Fire, gun, Zombie, bullet...
-She is very much afraid.

1851
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:29,442
What to do?

1852
01:48:30,609 --> 01:48:32,525
Yes.
What is he?

1853
01:48:32,816 --> 01:48:34,358
I don't have the mind
to shoot him?

1854
01:48:34,858 --> 01:48:39,150
Hey, why are you roaming
with this attire?

1855
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,941
Philips, don't you have?

1856
01:48:43,567 --> 01:48:46,816
Who is that knocking?
Go and open the door.

1857
01:48:46,816 --> 01:48:49,066
Brother, you're the don.
Go and ask him.

1858
01:48:49,066 --> 01:48:52,691
Why? If the zombie attacks me,
you want to enjoy.

1859
01:48:52,691 --> 01:48:53,400
Shut up and go...

1860
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,733
No, brother. As you're the don,
It'll be great, if you go.

1861
01:48:55,733 --> 01:48:56,275
Whatever I do, will be fun.

1862
01:48:56,275 --> 01:48:59,483
I'll go, brother.
-Dude, listen me. You shouldn't go.

1863
01:48:59,483 --> 01:49:00,150
Be quiet.

1864
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:01,442
Snehan, go...

1865
01:49:01,442 --> 01:49:02,733
Either you go...

1866
01:49:03,025 --> 01:49:04,609
Brother, atleast you go
and open the door.

1867
01:49:04,609 --> 01:49:06,525
Brother, they won't do.
I'll open it.

1868
01:49:06,525 --> 01:49:09,691
Dude, listen me, you're the only son.
-Hey, take off your hand.

1869
01:49:09,691 --> 01:49:11,150
Is it a 'Chandramuki' door?

1870
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:12,108
Can't it be opened?

1871
01:49:12,108 --> 01:49:12,691
I'm going.

1872
01:49:12,691 --> 01:49:15,317
Hey, dear!
-No!

1873
01:49:15,317 --> 01:49:18,567
When they're hesitating to open
it's better if you think.

1874
01:49:18,567 --> 01:49:20,317
Brother, I'll open it.

1875
01:49:20,317 --> 01:49:21,816
Hey, don't go...
Come back.

1876
01:49:21,941 --> 01:49:23,816
Don't knock.
I'm coming.

1877
01:49:24,816 --> 01:49:27,983
Brother, babes are inside.
-Is it?

1878
01:49:28,108 --> 01:49:31,317
All roaming with cake
applied on their faces.

1879
01:49:31,525 --> 01:49:32,275
Open it, let's see.

1880
01:49:32,275 --> 01:49:36,150
Look now,
the hunter is coming!

1881
01:49:47,358 --> 01:49:49,400
Oh, no! Brother!

1882
01:49:53,066 --> 01:49:56,858
Brother, save him.
Shoot now.

1883
01:49:56,858 --> 01:49:58,567
Don't I shoot If there is bullet?

1884
01:50:00,442 --> 01:50:01,900
It's biting the neck.

1885
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:03,233
Is this the Zombie?

1886
01:50:07,317 --> 01:50:09,275
Come, let's escape.
I can't.

1887
01:50:09,275 --> 01:50:12,650
Shoot with your pistol and save us.
We can't bear.

1888
01:50:12,650 --> 01:50:14,358
The pistol himself is trembling.

1889
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:15,691
Don't keep talking.
Do something.

1890
01:50:15,691 --> 01:50:18,275
He tracked the phone

1891
01:50:18,275 --> 01:50:20,400
But didn't track
the presence of the Zombie.

1892
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,900
They flipped him and bite all around.

1893
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:23,733
It's coming.

1894
01:50:23,816 --> 01:50:24,774
Come on.
Run away.

1895
01:50:24,774 --> 01:50:26,650
Take me too.

1896
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:27,483
Oh,gosh!

1897
01:50:28,275 --> 01:50:29,941
Isn't there anyone to save me?

1898
01:50:29,941 --> 01:50:33,025
Boss! Come on!
-Thanks!

1899
01:50:36,609 --> 01:50:38,483
They've trapped me!
Leave me!

1900
01:50:41,609 --> 01:50:43,358
Hey, traitor!

1901
01:50:43,358 --> 01:50:44,525
Half cooked idiot!

1902
01:50:44,525 --> 01:50:49,192
Poisonous animal!

1903
01:50:49,192 --> 01:50:51,858
Kattapa's backstabber!

1904
01:50:51,858 --> 01:50:53,066
Get spoilt.
Take your hands off.

1905
01:50:53,066 --> 01:50:54,691
Do you've sense?

1906
01:50:54,691 --> 01:50:56,317
You're opening the locked door.

1907
01:50:56,317 --> 01:50:58,192
I'll bang him, now.

1908
01:50:58,192 --> 01:50:59,983
Hey, you're talking disrespectfully.
-Just irritating

1909
01:50:59,983 --> 01:51:01,108
Hey, I'm the don!

1910
01:51:01,108 --> 01:51:03,066
Don! You nut...

1911
01:51:03,317 --> 01:51:05,983
Hey, If you've heed us,
we'd have given respect to you.

1912
01:51:06,192 --> 01:51:07,400
Hey?

1913
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:09,483
We're trapped by the Zombies.

1914
01:51:09,483 --> 01:51:12,442
We were planning to escape,
but you intruded...

1915
01:51:12,858 --> 01:51:15,275
Speak respectly.
I'm pitiful.

1916
01:51:16,192 --> 01:51:18,609
Are you going to die for the sake
of the phone?

1917
01:51:18,609 --> 01:51:20,983
Either you by-heart
or leave it.

1918
01:51:21,442 --> 01:51:24,941
You can spit on my face.

1919
01:51:25,317 --> 01:51:28,400
But save me from the Zombie.

1920
01:51:28,650 --> 01:51:31,941
Philips, if you save me,
I'll work for you.

1921
01:51:31,941 --> 01:51:33,233
No need.

1922
01:51:33,525 --> 01:51:34,774
No need.
-No.

1923
01:51:34,774 --> 01:51:36,400
Am I so cheap?

1924
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:37,650
Just shut up.

1925
01:51:37,816 --> 01:51:38,983
We can't work out anything,
now.

1926
01:51:38,983 --> 01:51:40,609
Only the old plan can be implemented.

1927
01:51:41,025 --> 01:51:41,816
Old plan?

1928
01:51:41,816 --> 01:51:42,442
Yes.

1929
01:51:42,442 --> 01:51:45,609
Yes, the old plan.

1930
01:51:46,066 --> 01:51:46,567
Is this?

1931
01:51:49,525 --> 01:51:51,400
I haven't played this role.

1932
01:51:51,733 --> 01:51:55,066
Okay, to escape I've to do anything.

1933
01:51:56,442 --> 01:51:57,358
I'm ready.

1934
01:51:57,650 --> 01:51:58,983
Philips, will you dress
me up with petticoat?

1935
01:52:16,816 --> 01:52:19,358
Looks like Nayanthara's attire.

1936
01:52:19,358 --> 01:52:21,192
How do you wear all these
and go around?

1937
01:52:21,192 --> 01:52:22,774
That's why, I'm wearing the shorts.

1938
01:52:22,774 --> 01:52:24,108
The costume is okay.

1939
01:52:24,108 --> 01:52:25,233
But why are you having a bag?

1940
01:52:25,233 --> 01:52:27,525
That attire was the other hero's.

1941
01:52:27,525 --> 01:52:30,150
If I don't return it.
he will thrash me.

1942
01:52:30,150 --> 01:52:32,358
Philips! You must save us
at the exact time.

1943
01:52:32,358 --> 01:52:33,691
You know the time, right?

1944
01:52:33,691 --> 01:52:36,733
My time is exact. Check your's.
-It's Baba mudra!

1945
01:52:36,774 --> 01:52:39,650
He'll save all of us.

1946
01:52:40,025 --> 01:52:41,567
Guys, Come, let's go.
Let' be serious.

1947
01:52:41,567 --> 01:52:44,233
Let's go, dear.
-Go...

1948
01:52:52,941 --> 01:52:54,733
Is this the zombie sound
-Go away.

1949
01:52:54,733 --> 01:52:56,567
Okay, why are you asking me
to go forward?

1950
01:52:56,567 --> 01:52:57,858
You're the reason for everything.

1951
01:52:57,983 --> 01:52:58,858
It's you opened the door.

1952
01:52:58,858 --> 01:52:59,567
Go...

1953
01:52:59,567 --> 01:53:01,567
We'll get caught as a clan.
-Go...

1954
01:53:03,442 --> 01:53:05,941
Go away.
I'll smash you.

1955
01:53:13,650 --> 01:53:14,609
Our guy!

1956
01:53:14,774 --> 01:53:16,941
Don't anyone know to escape?

1957
01:53:17,275 --> 01:53:19,567
His teeth is full of blood
wonder, what he bite?

1958
01:53:19,567 --> 01:53:21,108
Pistol brother,
-What?

1959
01:53:21,774 --> 01:53:24,525
Don't mess up.
-Where to go?

1960
01:53:26,275 --> 01:53:28,066
Again the same performance.

1961
01:53:28,066 --> 01:53:30,108
Won't they get tired?

1962
01:53:34,275 --> 01:53:37,066
Normally, he will roam like a
zombie

1963
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:58,108
Leave me.

1964
01:53:58,108 --> 01:54:00,275
Leave me,
if get caught, I'll be killed.

1965
01:54:00,275 --> 01:54:01,025
Please.

1966
01:54:01,025 --> 01:54:02,774
Save me.
Come on.

1967
01:54:02,774 --> 01:54:04,816
Leave me.

1968
01:54:04,816 --> 01:54:06,774
Listen me, if they see,
I'll lose my life.

1969
01:54:06,774 --> 01:54:07,567
Please, leave me.

1970
01:54:07,567 --> 01:54:08,442
Leave me.

1971
01:54:08,442 --> 01:54:09,941
Again he caught it.

1972
01:54:09,941 --> 01:54:11,983
You fool...

1973
01:54:11,983 --> 01:54:12,900
You moron.

1974
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,525
Leave me.

1975
01:54:14,525 --> 01:54:15,774
You don't have an idea
what are you doing?

1976
01:54:15,774 --> 01:54:18,400
I screamed feeble,
but it's you screamed loud.

1977
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,774
Leave me.

1978
01:54:19,774 --> 01:54:21,442
All have seen me.

1979
01:54:21,442 --> 01:54:23,941
Leave me.

1980
01:54:23,941 --> 01:54:25,400
Why are you rolling holding
my petticoat?

1981
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:26,983
Leave me.

1982
01:54:27,358 --> 01:54:30,317
Run away.
They're chasing us.

1983
01:54:30,317 --> 01:54:31,400
Oh, no!

1984
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,066
Run away.
-Run.

1985
01:54:34,858 --> 01:54:36,858
Don't know where Philips went.

1986
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:39,941
It's my assistant who is coming first.

1987
01:54:43,609 --> 01:54:44,650
Come soon.

1988
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,442
Hide safely.

1989
01:54:50,025 --> 01:54:51,150
Oh, god!

1990
01:54:51,233 --> 01:54:53,400
Good! They didn' see us.

1991
01:54:55,358 --> 01:54:56,858
Hey, why did you shout?

1992
01:54:56,858 --> 01:54:58,150
He just dragged your attire.

1993
01:54:58,150 --> 01:54:59,317
Just remove aside.

1994
01:54:59,317 --> 01:55:01,192
You know it, right?

1995
01:55:01,192 --> 01:55:02,983
I might've ashamed
if he dragged my attire.

1996
01:55:02,983 --> 01:55:04,150
Atleast, I screamed to save
myself.

1997
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:05,733
Don't know for what
he is screaming, crazily.

1998
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:07,941
You  goof, don't know
how to wear a petticoat?

1999
01:55:07,941 --> 01:55:08,816
You're not a don.

2000
01:55:08,816 --> 01:55:09,483
You're gone!

2001
01:55:09,483 --> 01:55:11,900
I'm an IT employee, even
I can't understand what you scold.

2002
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:13,233
How can he understand
who studied fifth grade?

2003
01:55:13,233 --> 01:55:14,150
I didn't write the exam.

2004
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:15,275
Is that more important now?

2005
01:55:15,275 --> 01:55:17,317
Only he lost his attire.

2006
01:55:17,317 --> 01:55:19,108
But it came to slit
my windpipe(sangu).

2007
01:55:19,774 --> 01:55:21,858
I want to know
what's 'windpipe' (sangu)?

2008
01:55:21,858 --> 01:55:23,941
Oh, god!
Just shut up.

2009
01:55:23,941 --> 01:55:25,400
Hey, where did you get him?

2010
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,108
It was missed at the right time.

2011
01:55:27,108 --> 01:55:28,733
Because of you,
the whole plan was flopped.

2012
01:55:28,733 --> 01:55:31,066
Because of whom?

2013
01:55:31,066 --> 01:55:32,609
You are blaming me
for everything.

2014
01:55:32,691 --> 01:55:35,108
The drunkard said
he'll come at the right time to save us.

2015
01:55:35,108 --> 01:55:37,525
Who knows, where is he now?

2016
01:55:38,275 --> 01:55:40,400
Even zombie will not scream
like this.

2017
01:55:40,483 --> 01:55:41,609
What's this?

2018
01:55:41,609 --> 01:55:43,816
Wait... wait...
It's heard, here.

2019
01:55:43,816 --> 01:55:46,733
Yes.
-Come, let's go and see.

2020
01:55:49,066 --> 01:55:50,025
Who is he?

2021
01:55:50,691 --> 01:55:54,983
I won't work listening to mind.
But, work listening tom heart.

2022
01:55:54,983 --> 01:55:59,066
I'm speaking to you more for an hour.
Do you hear me?

2023
01:55:59,066 --> 01:56:00,525
Why is he creating ruckus
with Buddha?

2024
01:56:00,525 --> 01:56:03,609
Didn't you go from there?

2025
01:56:03,609 --> 01:56:06,567
How can I come at the right time
without boozing?

2026
01:56:06,567 --> 01:56:07,941
Why are you speaking to him?

2027
01:56:07,941 --> 01:56:10,900
Chase him away.

2028
01:56:11,066 --> 01:56:12,066
Brain fire.
Come here.

2029
01:56:12,066 --> 01:56:13,358
What's this?
Bloody.

2030
01:56:13,691 --> 01:56:15,442
Cockroach smell.

2031
01:56:15,442 --> 01:56:16,233
You're local!

2032
01:56:16,233 --> 01:56:18,483
Yes, I'm local only.

2033
01:56:18,525 --> 01:56:21,774
He is creating unwanted issues.

2034
01:56:21,774 --> 01:56:23,400
Hit him.
-Leave me.

2035
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,025
Don't hit me.
It's hurting.

2036
01:56:24,025 --> 01:56:25,275
If you had returned the phone
on that day...

2037
01:56:25,275 --> 01:56:27,567
...my problem would've been solved

2038
01:56:27,567 --> 01:56:29,233
Who has intruded inside?

2039
01:56:29,233 --> 01:56:32,317
It's biting.

2040
01:56:34,066 --> 01:56:35,108
Hold on.

2041
01:56:38,567 --> 01:56:40,442
Let's flee.

2042
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,150
Go...

2043
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,733
It bites on the back
and on the front.

2044
01:56:50,733 --> 01:56:52,691
It's trying to bite all around.
-Hey,

2045
01:56:52,691 --> 01:56:53,691
Hey,
-What?

2046
01:56:53,691 --> 01:56:56,691
It bit him!
It's confirmed.

2047
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,609
Hey, keep your mouth shut.

2048
01:56:59,609 --> 01:57:00,941
What to do now?

2049
01:57:00,941 --> 01:57:03,733
Can anyone of you bite
and suck out the blood?

2050
01:57:03,733 --> 01:57:06,192
Hey, is this the snake bite?
It's Zombie's bite.

2051
01:57:06,192 --> 01:57:08,192
I know.
-His eyes are sucking in.

2052
01:57:08,192 --> 01:57:10,150
Don't panic me by blabbering.
keep quiet.

2053
01:57:10,150 --> 01:57:11,567
You guys take care, I'm leaving.
-Someone hold my hand.

2054
01:57:11,567 --> 01:57:12,733
Where are you going?
stop.

2055
01:57:12,733 --> 01:57:14,609
Zombie!
-Stay back and save me.

2056
01:57:14,609 --> 01:57:15,774
Zombie!
-Why are you leaving me?

2057
01:57:15,774 --> 01:57:19,483
It's confirmed.

2058
01:57:19,483 --> 01:57:21,066
Don't push.
-It's confirmed.

2059
01:57:21,066 --> 01:57:22,483
Is this zombie's bite?
-It's confirmed.

2060
01:57:22,483 --> 01:57:24,567
It looks like Zombie's bite.

2061
01:57:24,567 --> 01:57:27,650
In half an hour,
you might transform as Zombie.

2062
01:57:31,609 --> 01:57:34,150
In half an hour,
will I transform as Zombie?

2063
01:57:34,691 --> 01:57:35,816
Oh, no!

2064
01:57:35,816 --> 01:57:38,233
Zombie!
- Zombie!

2065
01:57:40,066 --> 01:57:44,483
Before I become a Zombie,…

2066
01:57:44,733 --> 01:57:49,941
…See, how I'll attack all the Zombies
and pack them up?

2067
01:57:49,941 --> 01:57:54,442
Master, I'm ready!

2068
01:59:49,108 --> 01:59:51,941
Your husband will be pound
in your hands.

2069
01:59:51,941 --> 01:59:53,774
How hard you are hiting!

2070
01:59:53,774 --> 01:59:54,816
Cheers!

2071
02:01:05,066 --> 02:01:07,108
Hey, Come on.

2072
02:01:09,774 --> 02:01:11,567
Who is that focusing baby light
on face?

2073
02:01:12,483 --> 02:01:14,691
Oh, gosh!
He is coming!

2074
02:01:17,941 --> 02:01:19,941
Does it smell?
-Shut up.

2075
02:01:20,525 --> 02:01:21,609
What are you doing?
-It's habitual.

2076
02:01:23,941 --> 02:01:27,650
'I've a bullet'.
Pistol!

2077
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:28,900
I've a bullet'.

2078
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,650
Why do you keep it?
Shoot and die.

2079
02:01:31,858 --> 02:01:32,900
Greetings, sir!

2080
02:01:33,525 --> 02:01:34,400
Welcome.

2081
02:01:34,609 --> 02:01:38,733
Pistol, see how I tracked you right?

2082
02:01:38,733 --> 02:01:43,900
Then also, you came at last.
-Though late, I'm the latest.

2083
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:45,317
What's this?
-What are you looking at?

2084
02:01:45,317 --> 02:01:49,567
Andhra, Nepal, Kerala...
A babe in between.

2085
02:01:49,567 --> 02:01:50,400
Hey!

2086
02:01:52,816 --> 02:01:56,275
You're enjoying.
Isn't it?

2087
02:01:56,275 --> 02:01:57,691
What's that I'm taking away?

2088
02:01:58,858 --> 02:02:00,609
You look something different.

2089
02:02:03,275 --> 02:02:06,858
You're caught with a big incident.

2090
02:02:06,858 --> 02:02:08,150
You're caught with the evidence.

2091
02:02:08,150 --> 02:02:10,358
I'll make you to suffer to the core.

2092
02:02:10,358 --> 02:02:12,650
Hey, look at them.
-Sir for self-protection...

2093
02:02:12,650 --> 02:02:15,816
Hey, stay away,
If a man wear shorts, he will drool.

2094
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:18,317
Who is he?

2095
02:02:20,650 --> 02:02:22,858
Hey, who is he?
Your guy?

2096
02:02:22,858 --> 02:02:26,066
He had hit everyone like
'Terminator'.

2097
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:28,192
I told him, If panneer comes
tears will roll out.

2098
02:02:28,192 --> 02:02:30,650
If he is bold enough,
send him to me.

2099
02:02:30,816 --> 02:02:31,774
He told me.

2100
02:02:32,108 --> 02:02:33,525
I'll show how dare I'm.

2101
02:02:33,774 --> 02:02:35,733
He is calling you
if you're dare enough.

2102
02:02:35,733 --> 02:02:37,025
Sir! Don't go there.

2103
02:02:37,025 --> 02:02:38,650
Actually, we wanted to approach you.

2104
02:02:38,650 --> 02:02:39,941
They're not normal human beings.

2105
02:02:39,941 --> 02:02:40,774
They're Zombies!

2106
02:02:40,774 --> 02:02:44,192
They'll suck your blood and
will transform you to never...

2107
02:02:44,192 --> 02:02:47,275
What's the problem?
Why the beauty is talking more?

2108
02:02:47,275 --> 02:02:48,691
Hey, beauteous!
Be quiet.

2109
02:02:48,691 --> 02:02:49,317
Sir, you go...

2110
02:02:49,317 --> 02:02:51,233
Sir, please don't go there.
-Sir you go...

2111
02:02:51,233 --> 02:02:52,691
Zombies will kill you.

2112
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:53,774
Zombies?

2113
02:02:54,358 --> 02:02:56,900
I know all these foreigners.
I'll kiss them.

2114
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:59,774
Go, sir.
Prove yourself as a man.

2115
02:02:59,774 --> 02:03:01,442
I'll come and look after you.
-Go sir...

2116
02:03:01,442 --> 02:03:03,816
Your eyes will be plucked out.
-Hey, beauty!

2117
02:03:03,816 --> 02:03:05,816
Sir, don't go.
-Go, sir.

2118
02:03:06,066 --> 02:03:08,609
Hey, why are you stretching
your hand?

2119
02:03:08,941 --> 02:03:12,650
The police department should regret
on your inclusion in the job.

2120
02:03:13,483 --> 02:03:16,609
I'll come and see you.
-You can see only if you come back.

2121
02:03:17,025 --> 02:03:19,816
Did you ask me whether
I'm dare enough to be a male?

2122
02:03:19,816 --> 02:03:22,025
Put your hands down,
you'll know.

2123
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:23,442
Hey, take your hands off.

2124
02:03:23,442 --> 02:03:25,233
Panneer got trapped.

2125
02:03:26,025 --> 02:03:27,816
Kill him.
Bite him.

2126
02:03:27,816 --> 02:03:31,609
The police is being thrashed.
you're just watching.

2127
02:03:31,609 --> 02:03:33,358
Be quiet.

2128
02:03:34,066 --> 02:03:35,774
If anyone talks,
I'll tear his frock

2129
02:04:44,192 --> 02:04:45,275
How will we get a bride?

2130
02:04:45,275 --> 02:04:47,317
If we ask,
they claim we're rogues.

2131
02:04:47,317 --> 02:04:49,858
Who participates in the
critic talk shows in media...

2133
02:04:51,317 --> 02:04:55,150
Why do you feel?
Take a peg.
