4
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,690
I return from your doorstep
after being insulted.

5
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,980
You were kicked out, weren't you?

6
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,980
Don't crack jokes.
I'm in a bad mood.

7
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,139
- What's the matter, advocate?
- I had to pay the rent for six months.

8
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,330
And the landlord
got a wrestler to bother me.

9
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,230
And you were kicked out?

10
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,420
I want to commit suicide, Jagat.
Don't try to stop me.

11
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,040
I won't stop you. Because I don't
have any money to lend you.

12
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,730
- You can at least give me alms.
- Sure. I've 2 annas. Fake ones.

13
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,190
Take it.

14
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
I wouldn't have a dime to buy
poison, had you not been here.

15
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,130
- See you, friend.
- See you.

16
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
- Listen...
- Yes?

17
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,420
Do keep on offering
flowers on my grave.

18
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,800
Don't worry, advocate.
The family members of all the...

19
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,420
accused whom you have put behind
the bars will offer flowers...

20
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,209
and lit candles, too,
on your grave.

21
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,829
You swine!

22
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,000
Listen, Jagat. I'm going
in search of a house.

23
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,590
This are my belonging.
If I happen to find shelter...

24
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,760
I'll ring you. You can bring
my belongings there.

25
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,400
Bye.

26
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,980
- You look to be from a decent family.
- Yes.

27
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,150
But still I would like a
reference from your old landlord.

28
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,200
- Reference?
- He'll give me your character certificate.

29
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,140
Character certificate?

30
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,600
Don't you know what a
certificate is?

31
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,670
I see. For that I'll
have to travel a long way

32
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,610
- Why?
- He was hale and hearty.

33
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,400
Just a single sneeze and
he died that very moment.

34
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,530
- His name was Totaram.
- My God!

35
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,210
You must have a certificate
from the previous landlord.

36
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,830
- I went to get it.
- Then what happened?

37
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,570
That Moslem guy was praying.
He bowed down and never rose back up.

38
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,649
Poor guy, he died while praying.

39
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,250
Goodness! Are you an advocate
or an angel of death?

40
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,040
For heaven's sake go away.
I don't wish to die.

41
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,730
- By God's grace I've four wives.
- Good God, you've four wives?

42
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,726
God knows when you'll
land in trouble.

43
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,060
I'm an advocate. I'll be useful
to you and your children.

44
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,409
There's a point in what you say.
Alright, I'll let you stay.

45
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,610
- Thank you.
- Jumman Khan.

46
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,150
- Coming, master.
- Show the advocate the room.

47
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,140
- The one below Mr. Digambar's.
- Thank you, Mr. Nawab.

48
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,300
Listen, the room above yours
belongs to Mr. Digambar Nath.

49
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,686
He shouldn't face any inconvenience.

50
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,000
Not at all.
I'm quite a loving person.

51
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,780
That's the trouble.
Mr. Digambar hates lovers.

52
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,380
You don't understand.
I'm a peace loving man.

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,940
What are you saying? The one
before you also liked Shanti (peace).

54
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,070
Mr. Digambar smashed his head.

55
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,346
Don't you dare look at Shanti.

56
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,300
- Not at all.
- Understand now?

57
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,020
- Thank you, Mr. Nawab.
- What's this?

58
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,070
Jumman, show me the room.

59
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,800
For example...

60
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,099
For example...

61
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,060
Take this impudent girl.

62
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,570
She must surely be a dark, ugly,
fat girl dancing over my head.

63
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,450
Just wait. I'll return after
completing the legal formalities.

64
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,730
- Rascal! Rogue! Swine!
- What? None of them are here.

65
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,200
Someone must've misguided you.
Go ahead.

66
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,409
Hey mister, decent people stay here.

67
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,430
The consequences won't be good
if you act tough. Got it?

68
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,030
What will you do?

69
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,750
- You'll be kicked out.
- Who would do that?

70
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,700
- I.
- Good Lord! Go ahead, push me.

71
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,210
I'll recite a new sonnet
about this situation.

72
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,210
- Impudent fellow!
- Sister, take this stick.

73
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,370
Great! The whole family
is here to attack.

74
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,430
Brooms, sticks, they have everything.

75
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,250
Anyway, forget all this Ms. Shanti.

76
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:01,200
I'm Ramesh Kumar, B.A. LLB.
An advocate. Please be seated.

77
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,680
No thanks. I'm here to ask
you the reason for this mischief.

78
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,180
This bamboo! Ms. Shanti, while
you were dancing upstairs...

79
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,456
the dust was streaming down.
I tried to see if the ceiling...

80
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,660
was strong enough and...

81
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,800
She gets angry over love,
and I love when she gets angry.

82
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,970
What are you doing?

83
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,090
You'll be charged under section 313.

84
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,106
You will be imprisoned
for six months.

85
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,180
I don't care. I'll teach
you a lesson...

86
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,060
Hey, wait! What's happening?
What's the matter?

87
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,890
Father, God knows from where the
Nawab has got this ruffian here.

88
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,220
I was dancing upstairs and he
thrust the bamboo underneath.

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,456
He talked rubbish when
I came to ask him.

90
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,830
- Mister, what's all this?
- Greetings!

91
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,070
You look tired.
Please be seated.

92
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,250
No thanks. I'm fine.
What indecency is this?

93
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,610
You can see for yourself.
Why ask me?

94
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,469
I see. You commit an offense
and threaten me too!

95
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,289
No sir. I've only committed
an offense.

96
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,020
- You are a tough ruffian!
- No. I'm a very tough lawyer.

97
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,429
My success is the talk of the town.

98
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,159
- Here's an example of that.
- Yes.

99
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,676
Dear, let this bamboo remain here.
I'll call the police.

100
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,590
- I'll see that he's behind bars.
- Don't trouble yourself.

101
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,500
- The police won't do anything.
- Why not?

102
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,396
- What will you tell the police?
- That you thrust the bamboo...

103
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,436
- from the ceiling of your room.
- I'll tell them that you...

104
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,219
- pushed it from your room above.
- My God! I did? What a lie!

105
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,246
- I'll say that. You've no proof.
- Really? You ruffian, swine...

106
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,360
Father, don't get angry.
You might have a high B.P.

107
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,540
Let's go. No use talking to
this ruffian. I'll deal with him.

108
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,300
- That would be good.
- Shut up!

109
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,060
But Mr. Digambar what's the
matter? He's a decent man.

110
00:08:52,530 --> 00:09:00,230
Decent? Just remember, Mr. Nawab,
as long as that rogue stays there...

111
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,939
- no decent man can come here.
- Why do you leave the place?

112
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,120
- I'll kick him out.
- No thanks.

113
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,310
I've arranged to stay elsewhere.
Here are your keys. I'll leave.

114
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,850
- Jumman Khan...
- Yes, master?

115
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,420
Saw what that advocate did?
He compelled...

116
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,950
my tenant to leave.
He's been here for 20 years.

117
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,459
Just go and see.

118
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,876
Thank you, my lord. My friend,
Mr. Dayal, says that...

119
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,189
my client, Prem Kumar,
abducted Sukhdevi.

120
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,359
This is baseless. Jury, just
have a look at Prem Kumar.

121
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,730
Can a person be a criminal who
has such an innocent face?

122
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,250
Never. Sukhdevi went with
Prem Kumar of her own free will.

123
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,560
The defense lawyer is forgetting
that Sukhdevi is a minor.

124
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,210
The reports from the doctors
prove that.

125
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,860
And taking a minor without
the consent of her parents...

126
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,760
is a dangerous offense.

127
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,630
Does the defense lawyer
wish to say anything?

128
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,830
The question of minor and
major is worth considering.

129
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,270
- Take for example...
- What do you wish to say?

130
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,556
Just this, that at a
certain age when the girls...

131
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,480
of our country mature,
the girls of other countries...

132
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,800
are still quite iimmature.

133
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,616
The court should think
before deciding...

134
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,380
the law is not the same
in all countries.

135
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,329
If the law is the same, the
lovers of many countries...

136
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,960
would be ruined.
People will stop falling in love.

137
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,160
I don't wish to say anything.
The decision lies in your hands.

138
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,089
If you wish,
you can destroy the love.

139
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,050
Come on, shake hands!
We've won the case.

140
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,200
- But it is yet to be decided.
- You and your lover will unite.

141
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,610
Can't you see. The judge smiles.

142
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,910
After hearing the defense lawyer
and the public prosecutor the...

143
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,260
court decides that Sukhdevi
should be handed to her parents.

144
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,626
And Prem Kumar, alias Ram Kumar,
should be imprisoned...

145
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,569
rigorously for 2 years
for kidnapping her.

146
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,219
You said I'd be united
with my lover.

147
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,520
God knows where these
advocates come from!

148
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,376
You tried your best.
But the case was complicated.

149
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,290
It is my destiny.
I get a complicated case.

150
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,670
A rude landlord, and a girl I
came across was rude, too.

151
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,380
You're quite interesting.
Okay, Mr...

152
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,020
Excuse me, I can't rent my
house to any of you.

153
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,490
- Why?
- You're bothering me now.

154
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,930
I can't rent my house to any of you.

155
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,300
- We'll pay you the full amount.
- So what? I've decided...

156
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,556
I'll rent my house only to an
old man. Not to youngsters.

157
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,980
You may all leave.

158
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,420
- Accept my greetings.
- Who are you?

159
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:16,230
I am Vajahat Mirza.
I am a resident of this city.

160
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,930
My destiny and situations forced
me to go a foreign land.

161
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,886
And what do I see when I return?
The whole city has changed.

162
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,449
Neither do I find any friends,
nor a house where I can stay.

163
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,010
My friend gave me your address.

164
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,410
I've come here to
test my destiny.

165
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,150
- Please help me.
- No problem. Come inside.

166
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,390
Thank you.

167
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,390
- Be seated, Mr. Mirza.
- Thanks.

168
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,990
- Will you have some cardamons?
- What?

169
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,880
- Cardamons?
- No thanks.

170
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,130
He is Mr. Mirza.
He needs a house to rent.

171
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,090
- She is my daughter, Shanti.
- Greetings.

172
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,550
May you live long!

173
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,636
- What do you think, dear?
- I think he's the right choice.

174
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,719
Great! I thought she might say that.

175
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,300
May you live long!

176
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,810
To tell you the truth, we needed
an elderly person like you.

177
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,940
- Very good. Great!
- But you should stay as...

178
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,560
- a paying guest with us.
- Paying guest? What is that?

179
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,150
It means the room
and furniture will be ours.

180
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,520
- And you'll have breakfast and meals with us.
- Marvelous!

181
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,050
What else do I need? In fact I
was in search of people like you.

182
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,850
- The rent would be Rs 100 p.m.
- Only that much?

183
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,386
- This is nothing.
- So do you agree?

184
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,640
Agree? You are strange!

185
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,000
Mr. Digambar, have some cardamons.

186
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,640
My belongings are in the tonga.
I'll get them.

187
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,900
Don't worry. Put his belongings
in the room and listen.

188
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,150
Now you have to look
after that room.

189
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,709
Watching your hospitality,
I feel that...

190
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,230
I have come to my wife's place.

191
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,880
- You are quite humorous.
- You haven't seen anything yet.

192
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,670
- You are strange.
- Want cardamons?

193
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,200
I'm happy that you've chosen
the stage setting as that of...

194
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,900
a court for the annual college debate.

195
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,840
Where two lawyers argue
while standing before each other.

196
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:06,540
And your topic is, what is
needed for a successful marriage.

197
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,310
Wealth or love?

198
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,410
The participants can proceed
with the debate.

199
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,090
Friends and respected principal,
marriage is the biggest...

200
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,890
problem of the life. And every
problem is solved by the mind.

201
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,140
The mind knows that happiness
lies in wealth.

202
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,840
Wealth is prestige. Wealth is power.

203
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,200
Wealth is faith. Wealth is God.

204
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,770
And if the mind is right,
one doesn't need love...

205
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,560
but needs wealth to marry.

206
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,260
Friends and respected principal,
a lover has said...

207
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,610
When in love one finds
everything beautiful

208
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,170
Life is worthless,
if there's no love

209
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,318
I would like to question my friend.

210
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,166
Is it right to compare the
lovely relationship of...

211
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,490
marriage with wealth?

212
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,150
Marriage means two people
stay together for a lifetime.

213
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,780
The unison of two souls.
It's not a business...

214
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,810
to think of profit or loss.

215
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:29,129
So you want to say
lovers don't need wealth?

216
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,330
No, just this thing...

217
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:39,790
Love doesn't desires wealth.

218
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,180
It's an exchange of two hearts.
And not a business.

219
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,520
Great! It means I have a chance.

220
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,270
Shanti forgets, an empty stomach
can't make love or recite a sonnet.

221
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,570
I'll say that it's better to
marry an old wealthy person...

222
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,919
in order to make the marriage a
success, rather than an idle...

223
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,710
young man who can only dream,
but not satisfy hunger.

224
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,340
The youth is ruined when one
enters into a relationship...

225
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,350
with an old man. All the
comforts prick like thorns.

226
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,260
I feel, for love one can live
an entire life in poverty.

227
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,040
But one can hardly live after
losing one's love by substituting wealth.

228
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,210
The love that my friend is
so proud of is sheer madness.

229
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,520
- Useless people do such things.
- If it's true...

230
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,810
then why did Savitri forsake wealth?

231
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,030
Why did Sita go into exile?
Why did Padmini plunge into fire?

232
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,380
Why did Meera consume poison?
There must be happiness in it.

233
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,750
Else the lovers wouldn't say
lying on their death bed...

234
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,879
Oh vulture, eat away my body.
You can have all the flesh.

235
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,970
Just spare my eyes.
For I hope to see my beloved.

236
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,450
Meera has also said,
had I known, love would give...

237
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:09,840
me so much grief, I would tell
everyone not to fall in love.

238
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,100
My friend has forgotten
the demands of the present time.

239
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,929
The biggest question of life
is not love...

240
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,350
but wealth, bread and clothing.

241
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:25,690
A poet has truly said, when
coins clink in one's pocket.

242
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,650
When one's stomach is full.

243
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,300
Even a stone appears as a diamond.

244
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,550
And dew-drops appear
like pearls.

245
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,980
What do I say to you all?

246
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,330
Love is the greatest wealth.

247
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,740
The woes of a lover's heart
are diamonds.

248
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,200
And the tears are the pearls.

249
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,150
When we came back to our
senses...

250
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,450
we forgot all about love.

251
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,770
We think only of satisfying
our hunger.

252
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,479
We've forgotten what love is.

253
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,820
We are in love.

254
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,419
We've forgotten the world.

255
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,160
Now don't talk about
being in our senses.

256
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,920
We are already out
of our senses.

257
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,110
Great!

258
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,150
I'll announce the judges's
decision about the competition.

259
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,310
The first prize goes to...
Ms. Shanti.

260
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,179
The second prize goes to...
Ms. Chanchal.

261
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,310
I'm sorry, you finished second.
Personally, I feel that your...

262
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,100
- thinking is correct.
- If you think that...

263
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,060
I'll think I've finished first.

264
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,580
- What are you watching, Chanchal?
- He's so rich...

265
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,736
and yet he's unmarried.
That girl would be so lucky...

266
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,750
- who marries him.
- He's as old as your father.

267
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,470
- So what?
- You're so fond of wealth...

268
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,050
- that you don't consider his age?
- Foolish girls think of age.

269
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,870
- You'll repent some day.
- Think about yourself.

270
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,550
If you're so fond of true love,
then go on, marry a beggar.

271
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,290
- Don't preach to anyone.
- I don't care.

272
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,500
Go on, marry a dying old man.

273
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,150
Bravo! One from me too!
A hard one!

274
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,180
- Hey! Get down.
- Wait. It's quite fun.

275
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,860
- I say, get down.
- Constable...

276
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,290
- Constable, how are you?
- I'm fine. Let's go.

277
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,766
- Where?
- Police station.

278
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,710
- Why?
- You'll know soon enough.

279
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,550
But constable, someone
was murdered inside.

280
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,970
- She's dead. Climb up and see.
- Really?

281
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,980
Hurry up. The situation is
quite delicate.

282
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,266
Greetings! What a match it was!
You were great!

283
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,970
- I've no words to praise you.
- I don't want to hear. Get lost!

284
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,909
- Where?
- Wherever you wish.

285
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,140
I'm going to the same place you are.

286
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,860
Come, I'll drop you.

287
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,880
What are you doing?
Your feet will ache.

288
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,480
- It's quite far off.
- Goodness! Stop following me.

289
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,860
Alright. Go on.

290
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,679
I know you didn't call me...

291
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,570
but is my company so intolerable?

292
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,690
I just came along
but you ignore me

293
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,410
God, you're something else!

294
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,150
I like to serve the beauties

295
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,770
I welcome the beauties

296
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,200
Don't get angry. Forget it

297
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,790
Here I am in your service

298
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,740
Whatever state my heart is in

299
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,290
It now belongs to you

300
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,400
Look here, give me a glance

301
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,860
Don't you play with my heart

302
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,430
God be praised,
you agreed with me

303
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,430
And my world is alright again

304
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,659
I made you laugh,
taught you to love

305
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,540
Won't you at least
say 'thank you'?

306
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,060
I know you didn't call me...

307
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,750
but is my company so intolerable?

308
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:08,720
I just came along
but you ignore me

309
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,350
God, you're something else!

310
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,320
You are incomparable.

311
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,150
- When will we meet again?
- Father!

312
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,580
- Father, come now!
- He harassed me all the way.

313
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,469
I just gave her a lift.
Now... My respects!

314
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,629
- At last Shanti has trapped you.
- Jagat, don't speak of her that way.

315
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,960
I want to marry her.

316
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,980
- Marry?
- It's no joke. I'm serious.

317
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,310
Really? This is some news!

318
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,940
When you go to give milk to
Mr. Mirza, ask about the rent.

319
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,120
I've to send money to your
sister. If the money doesn't...

320
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,970
reach on time, her drunkard
husband will come here.

321
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,380
I need the rent tomorrow.

322
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,670
Good!

323
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,139
Girl, tell your father not to
worry about the rent.

324
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,730
I'll get the money from the bank
tomorrow and pay him.

325
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,960
- Thank you.
- Girl, you're leaving?

326
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,960
Sit awhile. What's the hurry?

327
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,800
Today I was about
to beat a ruffian.

328
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,470
- Who was he? What did he want?
- I don't know.

329
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,430
He met me on the way and
followed me to the house.

330
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:05,000
- He must be a true lover.
- What are you saying?

331
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,560
- I hate the sight of him.
- Hatred! Girl, hatred is...

332
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:15,360
- the first sign of love.
- Must be. I only wish...

333
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,030
he'd stop following me.
Can't you do anything?

334
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,860
Why not? Call me whenever
he comes.

335
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,210
I'll teach him a lesson
he'll remember all his life.

336
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,560
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

337
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,770
- I'll leave.
- Okay.

338
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,450
- Thief!
- Not a thief! It's me.

339
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,210
- Why have you come? Go away.
- You get angry for no reason.

340
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,566
I've come a long way.
I just wish to talk to you.

341
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,139
I don't wish to talk to you.
You should leave.

342
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,070
I'm sorry to say, you're so
beautiful yet so ill mannered.

343
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,980
Just think...

344
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,150
Just... just think of how
strange this meeting is.

345
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,420
The solitude of the night,
this loneliness...

346
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,790
and a stranger comes to
meet a beautiful girl.

347
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,879
- Will you leave or not?
- Like the hero and heroine of a love story.

348
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,090
Facing each other. Their hearts beat.

349
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,450
Desires are restless.
But the lips are sealed.

350
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,870
Eyes meet each other.
But the secrets aren't revealed.

351
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,430
- Please go away.
- First give me a smile

352
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,690
- No.
- Give me a smile. Come on.

353
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,650
- No.
- Then, I won't go.

354
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,380
- You won't?
- I'll not go.

355
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,199
- Fine.
- Alright.

356
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,950
Oh God! Who is it now?

357
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,930
Mr. Mirza...
Mr. Mirza, open the door.

358
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,820
I can't even sleep properly
in this house.

359
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,020
Mr. Mirza...

360
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,810
- Girl, what is it?
- He's here again.

361
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,206
- Who?
- That ruffian. We left the...

362
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,720
old house due to him.
I can't disturb father.

363
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,850
He suffers an attack when
he gets angry.

364
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,940
Don't worry.
I can deal with him all alone

365
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,940
- Take me.
- Come on.

366
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,700
Girl, wait here.
I'll make a mincemeat of him.

367
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:24,020
Stupid! Rascal! Why the
hell have you come here?

368
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,610
I've come to meet Ms. Shanti.
I love her.

369
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,170
Love? She doesn't love you.
Why are you forcing her?

370
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,770
This is the question of my life.
If she refuses, I'll die.

371
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,830
You're going to die anyway.
Get out! Get lost!

372
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,649
Else I'll break your head.
Get lost! You devil!

373
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,330
- No, never!
- Never, really?

374
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,910
You won't go?

375
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,530
You'll lie in a pool of blood.

376
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,540
- You'll do it again?
- Just you wait Mirza!

377
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,380
Now I'll not consider your old age.

378
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,759
My God!

379
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,029
- Mr. Mirza?
- You pushed me? Rascal!

380
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:41,560
I'll skin you alive.
I'm no less.

381
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,760
Girl, just wait here.

382
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,850
Kill me. Skin me alive!
I won't stop loving her.

383
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,549
I'll lay down my life for Ms. Shanti.

384
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,480
You're still alive?

385
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,560
I'll teach you a lesson!

386
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,240
Oh God! This Mirza
has killed me!

387
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,060
Mr. Mirza, that's enough.

388
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:09,040
- Mr. Mirza?
- Lord is the ultimate truth!

389
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,109
- What are you saying?
- In our community when...

390
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,510
anyone dies, we recite this psalm.

391
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,690
- You killed him?
- He's not dead yet.

392
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,976
But one day by the grace of
Lord, he will die.

393
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,636
- But where is he?
- I pushed him from the window.

394
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,759
Goodness!

395
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,440
- Dear, you're crying?
- I didn't tell you to beat him so badly.

396
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,680
He didn't sin. He just loved me.

397
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,370
You're a butcher!

398
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,570
Girl, are you angry with me?

399
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:07,386
No, Mr. Mirza. Forgive me.
I was rude to you last night.

400
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,009
No problem. I regret that
I did such a thing yesterday.

401
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:16,890
- Poor chap! He's serious.
- Did you meet him?

402
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,360
- Yes.
- Where is he?

403
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,210
He's at the art gallery on
the corner of the road.

404
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,900
I think he has no one. Who will
perform his death rites?

405
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,960
- Old man, can't you see?
- As if you are quite young?

406
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,360
Forgive me, madam.
Today I won't sell any artworks.

407
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,380
My friend is dying.
How can I do business? Never!

408
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,660
I've not come to buy anything.
I've come to meet with him.

409
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,250
- What's your name?
- Shanti.

410
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,830
So you're the one who had
my friend beaten by Mirza.

411
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,090
- What do you want now?
- Don't get angry.

412
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,000
- I'm here to seek forgiveness.
- Whom will you ask to forgive?

413
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,880
He's been unconscious since yesterday.

414
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,480
Let me at least see him. Please?

415
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,990
This way.

416
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,550
Seen it?
Now are you satisfied?

417
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,259
No use crying.
If you really care for him...

418
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,860
sit beside him and serve him.
He's all alone.

419
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,089
Sit besides him.
I'll get the doctor.

420
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,530
Alright. I'll sit here.

421
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,770
Where am I?

422
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,930
You're at the art gallery.

423
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,640
- Who are you?
- I'm Shanti.

424
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,540
Shanti? Why can't I see you?

425
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:37,020
- Oh God! Why can't I see?
- Please lie down.

426
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,370
- You aren't well.
- I want to see my Shanti.

427
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:45,890
- I want to meet my Shanti.
- Mr. Ramesh, she is with you.

428
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,790
- Then why are you worried?
- With me? Shanti is with me?

429
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,480
Oh Lord! What do I hear?
Did you answer my prayers?

430
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,589
I don't believe it.
Shanti, come close to me.

431
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:16,220
- He has revived!
- Now I'll fall unconscious.

432
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,800
I'll leave. I'll return.

433
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:46,900
Rascal! Wait!
I'll beat you to pulp.

434
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,770
Father!

435
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,800
Father fell unconscious.

436
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,180
- How are you father?
- Quite fine.

437
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:15,690
I feel as though I was in
a deep slumber.

438
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:22,040
- Indeed! Two days and two nights.
- Two days and nights?

439
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,970
Yes. You kept on sleeping and
my medicines cured you.

440
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,410
And your son
served you day and night.

441
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:36,340
- My son?
- Yes. What's his name?

442
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:40,640
- Mr. Ramesh.
- Is that rascal still here?

443
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,980
He's not my son.
He's a dangerous man!

444
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:49,740
If not for him you wouldn't
have been saved, Mr. Digambar.

445
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,250
He might not be your son
but the way he has served you...

446
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,399
even your own son
wouldn't do it.

447
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,590
- Yes, father.
- Mr. Ramesh gave this letter.

448
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,310
Dear, read it aloud.

449
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,980
Mr. Digambar, I regret for
what I have done.

450
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,720
I did it out of my helplessness.

451
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,470
If only I could tell you
how helpless I am.

452
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,450
But now it's not necessary.
I'm leaving your house.

453
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:30,940
Forgive my innocence.
Your slave, Ramesh.

454
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,819
Rascal! He wants to run away
without paying my rent?

455
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,066
Go on child, bring him here.
Until he pays the rent...

456
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,360
he can't vacate this house.
Go on dear.

457
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,260
He mustn't have gone far off.
Bring him back.

458
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,310
Where is Ramesh?

459
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,700
My dear friend Jagat,
when you receive this letter...

460
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,330
I will have drowned myself.
My life is a burden.

461
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,540
I can't live like this any more.
I'm going to embrace death.

462
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,550
I'll drown myself in the lake
near Shanti's house.

463
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,720
Seek forgiveness from Shanti on
my behalf. Your friend, Ramesh.

464
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,070
You sit here relaxed.
You didn't even go to see him.

465
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:30,799
What's the use?
He must have already died.

466
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,020
- What did you ask God?
- You tell me first.

467
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,620
I seek your love.

468
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,880
- That's all.
- Now that I have you...

469
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,650
I have everything.
I seek nothing more from Him.

470
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,299
I know it's quite difficult
to have you as my wife.

471
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,830
But it's a human tendency.
He tries to possess the thing...

472
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,640
which is out of his reach.

473
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,850
It's difficult to have God.

474
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,990
But still a human sacrifices
everything in order to have Him.

475
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,890
Will God listen to my prayers?

476
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,350
Close your eyes and think of Him.
You'll find the answer.

477
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,819
Release my shawl.
What will the world say?

478
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,590
The world, too, is crazy
over these gestures

479
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,710
What will this crazy world say?

480
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:03,730
I'm leaving.
Continue with your love-story

481
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:08,770
There's mischief in the air.
And you're crazy, too

482
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,750
Beloved, listen to me

483
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:34,090
Just think, how will this
pleasant atmosphere feel?

484
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,710
Don't stare. Passionate
desires may flood my mind

485
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,580
I fear, you might hurt me
and leave me lonely

486
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:45,980
These are the days to enjoy

487
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:55,010
I'm not in my senses.
Who cares what others say?

488
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:35,720
The spring, the drizzling rain
and these showers

489
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:40,340
I'm shivering all over.
Hold my hand, beloved

490
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:56,740
Come, dwell in my heart

491
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:05,640
We are one now.
Who cares what the world says?

492
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,650
Release my shawl.
What will the world say?

493
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:15,160
The world, too, is crazy
over these gestures

494
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,320
What will this crazy world say?

495
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:21,980
- What will the world say?
- What will this crazy world say?

496
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,070
That son-of-a-gun, Ramesh hasn't
returned yet?

497
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,390
What, son-of-a-gun!
Father, he's still a bachelor!

498
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,740
I know. I mean, Ramesh.
What is he practicing?

499
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,320
He leaves before I wake up
and returns after I sleep.

500
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,490
Dear, I'll go and sleep.
Here are his room keys.

501
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,630
If he pays his rent, let him in.
Otherwise kick him out. Got it?

502
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,830
Alright. Let him come.

503
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,440
You?
I thought it was your father.

504
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,470
Put out the lights
or your father will beat me.

505
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,210
- What is it?
- The rent?

506
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,190
How unromantic are you?

507
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,570
This is father's money.
Pay the rent.

508
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,036
The house expenses?

509
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,930
Father returns this money to me.
I handle the expenses.

510
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,259
Great, Shanti!
This idea can work every month.

511
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:36,910
- What are you writing?
- My dear, I've penned a song...

512
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,940
on your exotic beauty.
You'll be stunned when you hear it.

513
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,160
- Want to hear it?
- Alright.

514
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:48,350
It goes like this.
Your dark tresses...

515
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:53,660
Nonsense! Where's the rent?
Yes, rent!

516
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,620
Hey mister, how did you enter?
How did you?

517
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,710
Actually, your rent.

518
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,290
Good that you came. Very good!
I was worried about you.

519
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,430
- Right, dear?
- Yes. You were worried.

520
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,220
Give him something to eat.
I'll send this to your sister.

521
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:25,470
Father, are you sending
a money-order to sister?

522
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:29,330
Yes. Her husband has wired me.
If he doesn't get the money...

523
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:34,730
he'll send her here. You know,
I hate that drunkard.

524
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,970
I'll send it over.
You might forget.

525
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,030
Alright. Send it today.

526
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:53,250
If you send the money,
what about the household expenses?

527
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:56,410
I can hold the money order
for a couple of days.

528
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:59,430
But you'll have to arrange
money for those days.

529
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,080
- Saw this?
- What?

530
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,000
Barrister Dayal and your
friend Chanchal got married.

531
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,200
- What! It's impossible.
- See this.

532
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,660
When and how did this happen?
I don't believe this.

533
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,870
- This news is false.
- Is it? Look there.

534
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,120
Darling, you don't know how
happy I am today.

535
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,420
My friends will be envious
reading this news.

536
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,960
Everyone will only talk about us.

537
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,609
I'll go crazy.

538
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,899
I'm happy to know you're
so happy marrying me.

539
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,520
- I never thought...
- That I would love you?

540
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,166
I'll change your life.
I will prove it...

541
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,690
How will you prove it?

542
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,770
The public prosecutor says
Mrs. Lal is the murderer.

543
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,720
But I'll prove that woman is innocent.

544
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:10,339
Sir, this is your house, not your court.
And don't forget I'm your wife.

545
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,750
Chanchal, there's a complicated
case going on in the court.

546
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:21,980
And I keep thinking about it.
You were talking about shopping.

547
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:31,130
I've deposited 50,000 in your
account. I can't come with you.

548
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:35,310
Go along with the manager and
buy whatever you wish.

549
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,359
I should leave for court.
I...

550
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:48,069
50,000!
I'll can buy anything.

551
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,339
Madam, where are you going
all dressed up?

552
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,136
I want to make Shanti jealous.

553
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,450
I want to show her
what I possess.

554
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,259
Wealth, respect,
all the comforts of this world.

555
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,390
This night is so beautiful.

556
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,620
- It has become beautiful.
- How?

557
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,310
You smiled, hid your face,
and the night became beautiful.

558
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:09,210
Who taught you all this?

559
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,440
Shanti taught me.

560
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:22,200
- Welcome.
- Excuse me. I came upstairs without telling you.

561
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,670
I thought you'd be alone.

562
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,890
No problem. Ramesh, she is...

563
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,320
I know him.

564
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:48,610
- He's not that ugly.
- I've a good heart, too.

565
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,740
- That I must test.
- Someone has already seen it.

566
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:56,020
Really?
Then what are you waiting for?

567
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,200
The musicians aren't available.

568
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:09,670
You look happy. Tell me,
what have you got?

569
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:12,160
- Didn't you see?
- No.

570
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:16,210
Not your fault.
No one can see this wealth.

571
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,740
- Then it must be an illusion.
- You're right.

572
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,560
Those who search for wealth
find every joy an illusion...

573
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,000
every smile a deception and
every laughter a sham.

574
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:35,230
And those who don't have wealth
suffer their entire life.

575
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:40,060
Happiness turns into grief.
Laughter turns into pleas.

576
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:45,500
Those people are misled.
Ask them to come here and see.

577
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,109
People here smile even in
extreme poverty. Right, Shanti?

578
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,970
- Let's see for how long?
- Till the last breath.

579
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,780
- Your love is so strong.
Right, Shanti?

580
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:01,640
What are you discussing?
Forget about it.

581
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:07,260
- How is life after marriage?
- Can't you tell.

582
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,379
- Of course we can see your riches.
- Ramesh!

583
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,919
Why didn't you bring Mr. Dayal along?

584
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,660
I forgot.
Mr. Dayal must be waiting for me.

585
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:26,259
Mischievous fellow.
Why did you insult her?

586
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:29,070
- What will she think?
- She must be jealous.

587
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,509
Mr. Dayal has had it today.

588
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,900
Keep on working! If you always work,
why did you marry me?

589
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,759
I'm preparing a case.
It's a question of one's life.

590
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:09,049
You worry about the world.
Don't you worry about me?

591
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,990
- What's wrong with you?
- You ask me that?

592
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,549
It's a month since we married.
You spend the whole day in court.

593
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:20,030
The days with the judge
and the nights with these files.

594
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:23,650
If you had to live this way
why did you marry me?

595
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,020
Why I married you?

596
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,430
Don't look in the books.
I'll answer you.

597
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,520
The way you got things
to decorate your home...

598
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,560
for the same reason
you acquired me.

599
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,259
You don't need a wife
but a doll, a show piece.

600
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:50,650
I know I can't spare time
due to my busy schedule.

601
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,300
But that doesn't mean
I don't care about you.

602
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,890
You might be caring for
me in your dreams.

603
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,990
I'll surely try to spend
some time with you too.

604
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:07,890
What's this?

605
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:22,440
Such a beautiful moonlit night.
Had lovers not been in this world...

606
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,330
God wouldn't have
created this beautiful night.

607
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,100
Let's go to the terrace.

608
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:40,170
Go ahead. I'll get the cigarettes.

609
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:42,990
Oh, the one with beautiful eyes...

610
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,440
look how pleasant the
atmosphere is

611
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:54,799
You've wounded my heart.
Now have some mercy on me

612
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,330
Watching these intoxicating eyes...

613
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:38,990
why wouldn't anyone go crazy?

614
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,360
The fire burns and passes the signals

615
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:46,950
What will the fire-fly do?

616
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:46,120
Don't save yourself from me

617
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:49,760
Come into my arms lovingly

618
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,109
Even the moon and stars
are envious...

619
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:58,130
listening to our love-story

620
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:02,320
Let the lights be turned off

621
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,980
Don't stop swaying

622
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:10,450
Let passionate desires
flood your mind

623
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:14,349
It's the time for love

624
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,300
Oh the one with
beautiful eyes...

625
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,290
look how pleasant the
atmosphere is

626
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:46,309
You've wounded my heart.
Now have some mercy on me

627
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:26,270
- Sister? How are you?
- Fine.

628
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,240
We haven't met in a long time.

629
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,560
Brother-in-law, what did you
get for me?

630
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:35,769
Why are you looking?
I emptied the bottle on the way.

631
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:43,650
Good that you're here.
Now I'm satisfied, I saw you.

632
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:46,890
- Don't talk like that.
- Greetings, father.

633
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,870
What's the matter?
My enemy seems to be unwell.

634
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:59,799
- I mean, how are you?
- The same old ailment.

635
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:05,140
Then there's no danger.
This ailment is routine.

636
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:08,860
- Shanti, did you call the doctor?
- Yes.

637
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,330
- Gave the medicine?
- Yes.

638
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:16,140
There's a tonga standing outside.
Pay him.

639
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:25,590
Dear, freshen up and eat
something. You must be hungry.

640
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:30,230
Instead I'm thirsty.
My whole body aches.

641
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:35,170
- Uma, let father rest.
- Go on.

642
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:45,200
Father, look after yourself.
We've no one besides you.

643
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,000
That's what worries me.

644
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:12,370
Remove my shoes. The atmosphere
of your house appears ominous.

645
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:15,339
You're sick.
Your father, too, is unwell.

646
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,380
You've turned the house into a hospital.

647
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,420
Arrange for some whisky.
My mind will be freshened.

648
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:29,340
Father is unwell
and you say such things?

649
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,320
Goodness! You're such a fool.
My dear wife...

650
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:40,170
I want to drink to his health.
The motive behind this is...

651
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:45,000
as soon as I gulp down a couple
of pegs, your father will get up...

652
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:47,960
and start doing work outs
like a wrestler.

653
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:56,040
- Don't say such nonsense.
- Your father doesn't drink.

654
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:00,620
Get money from your sister.
I'll arrange for my drink.

655
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,220
Didn't you hear?
The shops will bclose soon.

656
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:06,670
I won't ask money from my
poor sister for your booze.

657
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,160
I see. You show your true colors
as soon as you came here.

658
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,150
Forget not. One tight slap and
you'll come to your senses.

659
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:18,400
Kill me if you wish. But I'll
not ask for the money. Never!

660
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,370
You won't? You really won't?

661
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:27,540
Brother-in-law, what are you doing?

662
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,320
We belong to the old times.
This is our style of romance.

663
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,310
Stop fighting. There'll be a
problem if father comes here.

664
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,090
Really? Then give me some
money for my booze.

665
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:43,090
- Shanti, don't give him money.
- I don't have any.

666
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:44,570
Won't you?

667
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,500
Father is here.

668
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:50,620
- Leave Uma's hand!
- Father.

669
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:55,300
Why should I?
Isn't she my wife anymore?

670
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:58,296
Or have I turned coward after
coming to my in-law's place.

671
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,750
- I'll do as I please.
- I didn't know...

672
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:09,230
I'd married my daughter
to a lowly and brutal man like you.

673
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,990
Now you know it.
Everyone berates me...

674
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:18,130
- but no one lends me money.
- I say, leave her.

675
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,996
- Else I'll break your head.
- You can't even stand...

676
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,700
- yet you're flying high.
- You rascal!

677
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,700
- Father!
- What happened, Shanti?

678
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,090
Father fell unconscious.

679
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,430
- Father...
- Father...

680
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:43,780
Doctor, father will recover,
won't he?

681
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:53,200
Dear, go to your father.
He needs you all now.

682
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,760
Now my medicines won't work.
We can only pray.

683
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,480
Father!

684
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,960
Father!

685
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:28,520
Sister, don't worry.
Your husband will get the medicines.

686
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:31,170
Give me water.

687
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,820
- Sister's fever doesn't recede.
- How can it?

688
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,060
We have neither the money for
her treatment nor the medicines.

689
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,650
First, we sold the furniture,
then the jewelry.

690
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:02,530
And now we're left with nothing.

691
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:08,589
- My bangles, too, were sold.
- What do you mean?

692
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,460
I gave the bangles to
brother-in-law to buy medicine.

693
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,520
In spite of knowing he loves
his booze more than your sister?

694
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:19,920
I couldn't help it. You weren't here.
How could I leave her alone?

695
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
But I believe today
he won't do such a thing.

696
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:31,100
- He will...
- Get the medicines. Believe me, I wanted to get it.

697
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,900
With great difficulty I sold the bangles.

698
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,550
I reached the dispensary
after a lot of trouble.

699
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,680
But the dispensary was closed.
I couldn't get the medicine.

700
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,670
- So I couldn't think of anything.
- What happened later?

701
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:49,019
- Where's the money?
- Can't you see his state?

702
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,840
You're right.
Indeed, I was in a bad state.

703
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:02,670
I was tired, your illness,
my problems...

704
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,210
I felt dizzy. There was
intoxication in my eyes.

705
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,750
And I went on to have booze.

706
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:14,540
Your wife lies ill, Shanti gave you
bangles, and you squandered them.

707
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:16,770
You ought to be ashamed!

708
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,180
What did you say?
I ought to be ashamed?

709
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,370
It's women who feel shy.
Shanti is my sister-in-law.

710
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:28,740
Never mind her jewelry.
I would even sell her for my booze.

711
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:35,730
But I ask you, why have you been
staying here for free for a month?

712
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,920
If you act smart,
I'll kick you out of here.

713
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:47,559
Ramesh, don't argue with him.
Let's go.

714
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:53,759
- You're drunk.
- He ran away.

715
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:03,590
My Shanti is inside.
Who are you looking for?

716
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,710
- Shanti is my friend.
- Who are you?

717
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:12,179
- My name is Chanchal (erratic).
- That is obvious.

718
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:17,250
- Are you a jewelers's daughter?
- What?

719
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:21,730
Yes. You're adorned with
gold and diamonds.

720
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,559
You look like a traveling jewelry store.

721
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:32,420
Don't go there.
Ramesh and Shanti are inside.

722
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:35,219
- I want to meet them.
- Of course.

723
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:39,500
But you didn't get me?
The condition is worse.

724
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,190
Shanti's sister is ill.
I mean, my wife.

725
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,780
We don't have money even
for the medicine.

726
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:51,140
What if you go inside and
they ask you money?

727
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:56,260
- So what?
- What! How much do you have?

728
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,976
- I have some.
- Give me.

729
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,500
I'll get her the medicine.

730
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,570
You may go in.
I'll just drink the medicine.

731
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:16,510
I mean, I'll get the medicine. Bye.

732
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:23,170
It's been two days.
The doctor hasn't even examined sister.

733
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,460
Nor has she taken any medicine.
How long will she stay like this?

734
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:29,950
Don't worry, Shanti.

735
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,400
I gave money to your brother-in-law
to buy the medicine. He'll be here.

736
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,050
Brother-in-law?

737
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:44,960
- What's wrong?
- Why hide from you, Chanchal?

738
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,650
We're suffering because
of my brother-in-law.

739
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:54,040
Liquor has ruined him. We don't
have money to buy medicine.

740
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:57,339
He even sold my bangles
for his booze.

741
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:02,740
- Really? I didn't know that.
- What can I say?

742
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,070
After father's death,
we're in deep trouble.

743
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:11,650
We could have managed had
Ramesh practiced well.

744
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:18,730
Why don't you do something?
There's no harm in working.

745
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:24,980
- Job? Where will I find one?
- Somewhere, at least.

746
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,580
The owner of a theater
promised me a good job.

747
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:36,309
- Then?
- Ramesh doesn't want me to work on stage.

748
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,769
It isn't a question of like or dislike.
You have to survive.

749
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,100
You have an ailing sister.

750
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,081
A young sister and a brother
who have yet to complete their education.

751
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:49,650
What do you want? Their happiness
or false esteem? Think over it Shanti.

752
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:56,110
I agree. But I can't
let down Ramesh.

753
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,860
You can at least
make him understand.

754
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,990
You'll stop working
when he starts earning.

755
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:08,070
I'll speak to him. But now
I'm worried about sister.

756
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:13,540
She's in deep pain and we don't
have money for the medicine.

757
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:52,700
What a disaster!
The lawyer is washing dishes.

758
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:55,809
What times have come?

759
01:22:56,370 --> 01:23:04,370
Someone has rightly said, I washed
many dishes for your sake.

760
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,870
Don't get annoyed. If you
happen to break a plate...

761
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:15,150
it'll be deducted from
your salary. I'll leave.

762
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:34,450
Secretly, slowly, we both saw each other

763
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:37,219
And a magic worked

764
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:18,600
The first meeting left
a blush on my face

765
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:34,800
I'll still remember that beautiful night

766
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:48,500
It was a moonlit night.
There was a music in the air

767
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:39,419
The eyes met each other
and I couldn't say a word

768
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,610
I felt shy

769
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:57,510
You stood silently, holding my hands

770
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:06,980
Aren't you aware of the
fire raging within you?

771
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:12,769
- The fire is put out.
- No, instead it rages beneath the ashes.

772
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:16,410
Let's go.

773
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:23,880
Have a seat.

774
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:28,970
- Why have you come here?
- To meet you.

775
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:31,050
- Me?
- Yes.

776
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:34,370
We both have the same problem.

777
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,270
Every evening your Shanti is at the
theater and my husband is in his office.

778
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,920
I don't know how
to pass the evening.

779
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:45,190
What were you doing
in the kitchen?

780
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,559
Want to know the truth?
I was washing dishes.

781
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,840
- What? Washing dishes?
- Yes.

782
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:55,600
- But why were you washing them?
- To pass the time.

783
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:59,310
What are you saying? ls there no
work left for you in the world?

784
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,040
Are you worthless?
Why would you think that?

785
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:08,120
- Not me, the world thinks so.
- If you join hands with the wrong person...

786
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:10,210
how can the world to be blamed?

787
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:13,010
I feel sorry to see you like this.

788
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:15,010
Why didn't you tell me before?

789
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:19,190
I'm not in the habit of sharing
my problems with anyone.

790
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:26,440
You take me to be a stranger.
But I don't. You're my neighbor.

791
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:30,429
I've the right to share your
joys and sorrows.

792
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,440
I can't see you in this state.

793
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:42,610
I respect your feelings.
But how can you help me?

794
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:48,630
You want to know?
Come with me. Come.

795
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:58,230
If you work for me, I would be
relieved of the burden.

796
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:05,570
She cares for me so much.
She solved my problem quickly.

797
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:06,889
Mine, too.

798
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,200
I'll work whole heartedly.

799
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:13,510
A person is respected
for his work.

800
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:19,280
Chanchal will decide how I'll gain
from making you my assistant.

801
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:22,059
After all, she recommended you.

802
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,920
I don't believe Mrs. Dayal will
ever get a chance to complain.

803
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,550
If you're sensible enough,
there's no need to complain.

804
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:33,270
- You can start work tomorrow morning.
- Thank you.

805
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:57,700
- Today you've done my work.
- My servant shirks his work.

806
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,990
I see. Then listen carefully.

807
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,049
Your servant won't do any work
because he found a job.

808
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:06,080
- You got a job?
- Yes.

809
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:08,410
Your friend Chanchal made me
Mr. Dayal's assistant.

810
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:11,470
- My salary will be 500 per month.
- Really?

811
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,019
- Yes.
- Then we will enjoy.

812
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,040
- No more of the theater.
- What about the contract?

813
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:20,280
It's just for 3 months.
No more work after that.

814
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,430
Then I'll enjoy living off your salary.

815
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:26,009
You know what I see
in your eyes today?

816
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,180
- What?
- The glitter for which I searched.

817
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:33,140
The intoxication, the pleasure,
the coquetry...

818
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,170
which makes a man
feel proud when he's in love.

819
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,710
Today I can hold your hands
and ask...

820
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:44,780
- Ask what?
- Will you be mine?

821
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,126
- Did you write down the points?
- Yes. Just read it.

822
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:58,480
I'll read it later. I've to
go to meet the collector.

823
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:02,339
- You're leaving again?
- If I don't go today...

824
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:04,500
I'll miss the chance
of becoming a judge.

825
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:10,650
What about my evenings?
With whom should I go shopping?

826
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:16,610
You can go with Ramesh.
Ramesh, please go with her.

827
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:19,366
I thought of updating the points.

828
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:21,880
- You can do it tomorrow.
- Alright.

829
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:28,470
I'll be back.

830
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:54,300
- What happened?
- A pain.

831
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:59,950
- Sometimes I get this pain.
- Consult a doctor.

832
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:04,879
- Who'll take me to the doctor?
- Mr. Dayal.

833
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:08,740
Had he cared for me,
why would I be in pain?

834
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:17,900
My body aches. I have
a fever, too. See for yourself.

835
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:21,700
I think I, too, have a fever.

836
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:26,870
You remember, you have to go
shopping. It's getting late.

837
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:51,510
A dozen silk shirts, 3 suits,
1 dress suit...

838
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,600
- You've spent a lot on me.
- Don't worry.

839
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:58,960
I know how to make up
for my expenses.

840
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,710
- How?
- You're quite innocent.

841
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:05,799
- Do I have to explain?
- Please, tell me.

842
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,770
I've been signaling to you for a while now.
You don't even see me.

843
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:25,450
- I didn't see you.
- Why should you?

844
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:29,420
- After all, he's with you.
- What's the matter?

845
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:33,790
Don't ask my well-being.
I haven't received money yet.

846
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,900
Remember, I'll return every
penny of yours.

847
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,700
- I'm not here for money.
- Excuse me. I don't seek alms.

848
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:46,690
How much do I owe you?
50, right? Then do one thing...

849
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,610
- What?
- Lend me 50. It'll make 100.

850
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:56,550
- It'll be easy to remember.
Oh! You're so sensible

851
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:04,500
- One small request.
- Even a big one will do.

852
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:08,730
- Don't tell Shanti that...
- You were with Ramesh?

853
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,520
Is this a thing to say?

854
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:15,730
Why are you staring?
A double.

855
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:33,920
I was held up somewhere.

856
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:37,830
Excuse me, darling.

857
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:49,510
Let me see.

858
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,460
Those earrings are good.
Where'd you buy them?

859
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,000
You were supposed to come early
since it's a holiday.

860
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,920
And you've come now.
It's 10 PM.

861
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:00,480
I was held up. Didn't you go?

862
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:03,930
- How could I go alone?
- That's why you got angry.

863
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:09,680
Oh God! You're a great poet.

864
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,429
There it was Chanchal and
in here you're with Shanti!

865
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,930
Aren't you ashamed to malign anyone?

866
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:23,780
I might lie.
At least ask the lawyer...

867
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:28,010
in which court he was working
at these late hours.

868
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:31,790
I don't need to ask him.
I trust him completely.

869
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:37,440
I, too, trust him. But it's not
right to roam around with...

870
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,959
Mr. Dayal's young wife at
this late hour.

871
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:44,500
They were sitting
in the Pride of Asia bar.

872
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:47,190
It's a restaurant cum bar, you see.

873
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:51,170
- Today it was tea but tomorrow...
- I don't believe you.

874
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:52,980
You don't?

875
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:58,060
Shanti, I took Chanchal out shopping.

876
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,460
Then we had tea.
That's why I was late.

877
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,420
Heard that?
It was an ordinary thing.

878
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:09,850
Ramesh, these girls
have a jealous nature.

879
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:21,210
Good God!

880
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:35,450
- What's the matter?
- I'm here to congratulate you.

881
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:39,720
Congratulations! Your love and
my efforts have yielded fruit.

882
01:35:40,450 --> 01:35:43,220
Listen, I told Shanti about
what I saw yesterday.

883
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:47,210
Since then, Ramesh and Shanti
aren't speaking to each other.

884
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:52,549
- I didn't say so.
- Really? My darling...

885
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:58,746
don't hide from me. It's simple.
You need Ramesh, his love.

886
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:01,320
- This is wrong.
- Wrong? Let me hear.

887
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:07,030
Your heart says something else.
I've no fondness for you, dear.

888
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,490
- Frankly speaking, I hate you.
- Hate me?

889
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,980
Because you want to break
my innocent Shanti's heart.

890
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:19,640
You've all the riches but
Shanti only has Ramesh.

891
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,450
You'll have to pay for
snatching Shanti's love.

892
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,339
- Pay whom?
- Me.

893
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:28,436
- You?
- It was my doing to separate...

894
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,690
Shanti and Ramesh and get
Ramesh close to you.

895
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:35,240
- The price is only 5000.
- 5000?

896
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,310
The price you'll pay to enjoy
for your entire life.

897
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:44,049
But Shanti and Ramesh...
How is this possible?

898
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:48,630
I'll make it possible.
Prakash can do anything for booze.

899
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:52,080
He can die and he can
also kill someone.

900
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:55,710
If you say,
should I kill Mr. Dayal?

901
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:01,349
Got scared? For how long will
you love on the sly?

902
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:09,260
There's a New Year program at
the Pride of Asia club tonight.

903
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:12,460
Shanti, too, will come there
from her theater company.

904
01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:17,559
You'll have to get Ramesh there.
I'll manage the rest.

905
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,946
- What will happen there?
- The old bonds will sever...

906
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:27,110
and new bonds will be forged.
Didn't you understand?

907
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,720
Oh God!

908
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:37,469
- You called for me?
- Yes.

909
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:43,490
- Aren't you ready yet?
- I'm not feeling well.

910
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:46,460
- I'm not going anywhere.
- What are you saying?

911
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:50,640
The commissioner has invited
us for dinner on the New Year.

912
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:52,870
I'm tired of these old men.

913
01:37:55,730 --> 01:37:59,549
I would be delighted to take
you along with me.

914
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:03,710
People envy my fate when
they look at you.

915
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:09,560
- Please come.
- I've a headache.

916
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:13,970
I think I have a fever, too.
Let me stay at home.

917
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:23,469
Okay. I'll go alone.
Call the doctor.

918
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:41,000
Pride of Asia bar.
I'm Mrs. Dayal speaking.

919
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:45,540
Book two seats for me
for dinner and dance.

920
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:48,320
Yes. The corner ones.

921
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:09,020
Make Ramesh eat this chocolate
when he comes here.

922
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:13,380
Else he'll take Shanti out.
If he has this chocolate...

923
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:16,720
he'll become intoxicated. Take this.

924
01:39:32,110 --> 01:39:34,240
Pour in some more whisky.

925
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:43,506
What are you doing?
The whisky is quite strong.

926
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:45,349
- He'll fall unconscious
- I know that.

927
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:52,050
Give this glass to Madam.
And this one to the man...

928
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:54,370
sitting with that madam. Go!

929
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:39,700
Let the fire burn

930
01:41:55,510 --> 01:42:01,380
Let the night pass by

931
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:07,110
I will not leave...

932
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:14,540
this colorful party

933
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:19,810
Good Lord! These eyes...

934
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:27,960
can make anyone feel intoxicated

935
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:30,990
I... I have forgotten my way

936
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:47,889
The night is pleasant
with beauties all around

937
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,860
My heart is swaying

938
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:08,570
Please don't call me today

939
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,940
Someone stops me...

940
01:43:16,410 --> 01:43:20,040
whose arms are like the
bottle of wine

941
01:43:57,870 --> 01:44:01,410
There is intoxication in the air

942
01:44:01,930 --> 01:44:05,380
It will be great if
I become unsteady, too

943
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:22,080
The mind should become intoxicated

944
01:44:26,070 --> 01:44:29,660
These gestures, this style...

945
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:33,650
arms which are like the
bottle of wine

946
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,680
I can't remember...

947
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:21,150
I can't remember,
whether my love is here...

948
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:25,230
or is she somewhere else?

949
01:45:37,650 --> 01:45:41,969
Look, I'm not in my senses

950
01:45:45,870 --> 01:45:49,440
Good Lord, these eyes

951
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:53,410
These arms are like
the bottle of wine

952
01:45:54,620 --> 01:46:00,760
Good Lord! These eyes...

953
01:46:01,140 --> 01:46:05,040
can make anyone feel intoxicated

954
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:08,330
I... I have forgotten my way

955
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:27,900
Can make anyone feel intoxicated

956
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,610
I... I have forgotten my way

957
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:36,590
Good Lord, these eyes...

958
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:45,586
can make anyone feel intoxicated

959
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:48,990
I... I have forgotten my way

960
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:05,580
Shanti, forgive me.
I couldn't come to take you.

961
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:10,970
You see, Chanchal!
She didn't let me go.

962
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,750
I requested her so much.
At last I stopped.

963
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:20,100
Frankly speaking, I had lots of fun.

964
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:35,390
Why are you staring?

965
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:42,040
You think I've consumed liquor.

966
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:45,166
Not at all.
I've not had liquor.

967
01:47:45,190 --> 01:47:51,769
I had... lemon.
Lemonade!

968
01:47:56,510 --> 01:47:59,170
I had lemon.

969
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:08,140
Were you so ashamed of yourself
you wouldn't come here?

970
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:11,660
Go away.
Get out of my sight!

971
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,350
Where are you going?
Come inside.

972
01:48:32,570 --> 01:48:38,059
Leave me.
I've never been so insulted.

973
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,550
You, too, can't insult me.

974
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:45,530
Ever since you started working
in the theater you've been rude to me.

975
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:51,530
You think I'll stay here
after listening to your threats?

976
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:55,510
Do you think you've bought me?

977
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:00,136
Ramesh, come inside.
You're not in your senses.

978
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:01,760
I'm in my senses.

979
01:49:04,190 --> 01:49:10,519
I've come to know
your changing moods.

980
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,350
Now I don't care for you
or your money.

981
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:21,900
I won't be dependent on you.
I'll work for my living.

982
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:25,100
- Ramesh, I'll not let you go.
- Leave me.

983
01:49:57,710 --> 01:50:01,780
Ramesh is not dependent on
anyone. He can do as he wants.

984
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:04,520
Hush! Mr. Dayal might wake up.

985
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:11,490
- I'll take you to your room.
- You're a very nice girl.

986
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:14,110
I'll reward you.

987
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:52,790
I'm in my senses while
making this will.

988
01:50:54,110 --> 01:50:57,049
Beause I don't want my wife to
squander my hard earned money...

989
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:00,510
for her ill vices...

990
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:04,280
that's why I request the court...

991
01:51:05,150 --> 01:51:06,860
that after my death
all my wealth...

992
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:11,580
all my property should not fall
into the hands of my wife, Chanchal.

993
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:37,690
- When did you come?
- A long time ago.

994
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:40,250
Why didn't you inform me?

995
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:47,860
You were unwell. I thought your
health might worsen were I to wake you.

996
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:52,639
What's the matter?
You look troubled.

997
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:55,250
Come on.

998
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:01,630
- Would you benefit if I sleep?
- Maybe.

999
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:04,370
I'll have to suffer if
you fall sick.

1000
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:09,300
- Tomorrow, you will come with me.
- Where to?

1001
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:16,560
Far away, by the river side.
Where, we will be all alone.

1002
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,570
- We can talk peacefully.
- What have we to talk about?

1003
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,410
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Now go to sleep.

1004
01:52:24,910 --> 01:52:26,309
I have important work.

1005
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:02,020
You haven't married me,
but my wealth.

1006
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:06,670
I won't give you a penny.
This is my will.

1007
01:53:07,150 --> 01:53:08,450
I've disinherited you!

1008
01:53:09,250 --> 01:53:11,760
Please forgive me.

1009
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,460
I promise, this won't be repeated.

1010
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:18,740
- We'll fire Ramesh.
- You'll sack Ramesh?

1011
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:20,536
What's the point?

1012
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:23,040
If lust overpowers your mind,
there will be many more Ramesh's.

1013
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:27,780
I'll not leave the house. You can
test me. Give me a chance.

1014
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:29,430
I don't have time for you.

1015
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:34,230
I can drop you in the city.

1016
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:37,349
Then you can go anywhere,
to Ramesh or someone else.

1017
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,500
What's this? Both tires are flat.

1018
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:47,240
There are no taxis around.

1019
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:53,000
We can find transport
across the river. Let's go.

1020
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:26,900
Help! Save me!

1021
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:09,309
We had been to the beach
for a picnic.

1022
01:55:11,410 --> 01:55:13,680
We were all alone.

1023
01:55:17,290 --> 01:55:21,940
While returning, we discovered
our car's tires were flat.

1024
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:26,160
And we could find transport
only across the river.

1025
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,440
That's why we decided
to row across.

1026
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,990
I stood on the river bank
holding the oar.

1027
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:41,110
Beause there was no boatman.

1028
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:51,590
I said, let's row across.

1029
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,260
And he agreed.

1030
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,120
I wish I hadn't suggested it.

1031
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,400
If only he hadn't listened to me.

1032
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:14,950
It's destiny. How could you know the boat
would capsize in the strong current?

1033
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:40,519
My God!

1034
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:48,830
I swear, you look beautiful
in this black outfit.

1035
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:51,960
May God keep you as a widow
your entire life.

1036
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:56,260
- Why did you come here?
- Why ask such a thing?

1037
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:01,330
The deceased one has
left you much wealth.

1038
01:57:02,150 --> 01:57:07,290
If you don't use it properly,
his soul will feel sad.

1039
01:57:08,130 --> 01:57:12,290
I'll inform the police
you killed Mr. Dayal.

1040
01:57:13,820 --> 01:57:18,380
You're no fool.
Until I've seen Mr. Dayal's will...

1041
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:23,580
you can take no action against me.
Give me the money quickly.

1042
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:25,849
My throat is dry.

1043
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:48,440
- You're quite sensible.
- Tell me if you need more.

1044
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:50,040
Thank you.

1045
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:52,760
- How many days have passed?
- About 15 to 20 days.

1046
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,540
You haven't seen Shanti since then?

1047
01:57:55,700 --> 01:58:00,360
Why meet her? If she cared for me,
she would've come to me.

1048
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:04,176
Would she come to convince you?
It's your fault. Why would she come?

1049
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:07,280
- I'm at fault? - Naturally.
- I didn't drink purposely.

1050
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:10,540
And she didn't even think
what I went through that night.

1051
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:13,510
Good that Chanchal saw me
and took me home.

1052
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:15,580
Else I would've spent the night
on the streets.

1053
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:18,360
I suppose every night of
yours is quite pleasant.

1054
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,460
Along with Chanchal in her house.

1055
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,570
- I'm a master in all this.
- What nonsense?

1056
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:30,770
I speak sense. You forgot Shanti
and got involved with Chanchal.

1057
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:35,660
But Shanti didn't forget you.
She will never forget you.

1058
01:58:36,740 --> 01:58:39,219
You know she's stopped
acting in the theater.

1059
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:43,400
She doesn't even meet anyone.
I have observed many times.

1060
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:46,220
She comes towards your room
in the night.

1061
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:49,240
She wanders on the terrace like
an insane person, waiting for you.

1062
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,570
The moon is up again

1063
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:22,700
But you didn't arrive

1064
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:27,230
My heart burns again

1065
01:59:28,430 --> 01:59:31,720
Oh! What do I do?

1066
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:16,010
This night reveals to me...

1067
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:19,710
gone are those days of mine

1068
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:25,460
My heart knows.
You are no longer mine

1069
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:45,620
Still my eyes long to see you

1070
02:00:45,690 --> 02:00:50,120
Oh! What do I do?
I remember you

1071
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:38,020
My heart burns in agony

1072
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:44,600
Please do come,
for I feel stifled now

1073
02:01:59,150 --> 02:02:04,299
The spring season has
left me suffering

1074
02:02:04,490 --> 02:02:09,360
Oh! What do I do?
I remember you

1075
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:14,130
The moon is up again

1076
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:18,510
But you didn't arrive

1077
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:23,210
My heart burns again

1078
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:27,610
Oh! What do I do?

1079
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:43,700
Shanti, angry with me?

1080
02:02:59,390 --> 02:03:01,550
I knew you would never
leave me alone.

1081
02:03:04,110 --> 02:03:07,820
You would surely return.
Because you, too, love me.

1082
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:13,429
Good Lord! I was saying
this from the first day.

1083
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:16,440
Get out of here!
Right now!

1084
02:03:20,270 --> 02:03:26,970
Good! Why vent your anger on me?
Let him go to hell.

1085
02:03:27,450 --> 02:03:30,590
I was aware
Ramesh wouldn't be trapped.

1086
02:03:31,710 --> 02:03:36,980
- But you were crazy in love.
- Don't talk nonsense.

1087
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:42,930
- Get lost from here.
- Don't get so angry.

1088
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:47,130
Else your youth will turn
into a fireball.

1089
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:51,170
Let it be.
Why be sad over it?

1090
02:03:51,550 --> 02:03:55,120
- I'm here for you.
- Won't you leave?

1091
02:03:55,810 --> 02:03:59,260
Fine. I'll leave.
But the thing is...

1092
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:03,180
I'm in a bad state since
yesterday. I haven't a dime.

1093
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:06,840
No booze. If you can arrange
for something...

1094
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:19,640
Fine.

1095
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:57,270
Hand over the will to me.
Come on.

1096
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:09,150
Here. Drop the toy
else I'll shoot you.

1097
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:32,900
Remember, Prakash is not a
drunkard and a nincompoop.

1098
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,330
If I could kill Dayal,
I can strangle you, too.

1099
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:44,139
Brother-in-law, you?

1100
02:05:56,350 --> 02:06:00,290
Now you're doomed.
Everyone will come to know...

1101
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:05,240
- who murdered Mr. Dayal.
- But the door was closed.

1102
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:08,080
- How could she hear?
- What if she has heard?

1103
02:07:08,210 --> 02:07:12,500
Shanti, no use hiding.
You've learned all my secrets.

1104
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:15,780
I won't spare you alive.
Come out!

1105
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:19,520
Shanti, come out.

1106
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:32,110
Beware!

1107
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:37,800
One step forward and
I'll shoot you!

1108
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:41,570
You won't kill me. After all,
I'm your brother-in-law.

1109
02:07:42,750 --> 02:07:45,576
Your sister's husband.
You can't shoot me.

1110
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:46,700
Stop!

1111
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:41,419
Drop the gun!
I say, drop the gun!

1112
02:08:58,050 --> 02:08:59,250
You fired?

1113
02:09:06,410 --> 02:09:09,030
Come with me. Come on.

1114
02:09:15,110 --> 02:09:16,210
Listen...

1115
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:25,780
Mrs. Dayal, a murder has taken
place in your compound.

1116
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:28,570
- What!
- I've arrested the criminal.

1117
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:31,599
It's a lie.
Shanti could never kill anyone.

1118
02:09:32,130 --> 02:09:35,480
She has confessed her crime.
I've to call the police station.

1119
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:38,769
- Did you hear?
- Please come.

1120
02:09:53,470 --> 02:09:54,770
I'm lnspector Khanna.

1121
02:09:56,900 --> 02:09:58,820
A murder has taken place
at Mr. Dayal's bungalow.

1122
02:09:59,150 --> 02:10:02,990
Yes. I've arrested the criminal.
Come over quickly.

1123
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:05,830
Hurry up.

1124
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:10,860
Where's the body?

1125
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:26,670
In your statement you said
that at midnight...

1126
02:10:27,350 --> 02:10:29,190
while taking a stroll on your terrace...

1127
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:32,710
you saw two shadows
in Mrs. Dayal's bedroom.

1128
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:37,390
It looked to you like a man
was strangling a woman.

1129
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:40,570
After seeing this you
went over to Dayal's house.

1130
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:44,550
Can you tell me why?

1131
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:50,040
It's a person's duty
to help someone in trouble.

1132
02:10:50,620 --> 02:10:55,860
You're right. On reaching there you saw
Mr. Prakash strangling Mrs. Dayal.

1133
02:10:56,740 --> 02:10:58,440
After seeing this
you still turned back?

1134
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:03,610
Yes.

1135
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:07,890
Point to be noted. The convict
was fulfilling her duty.

1136
02:11:08,830 --> 02:11:11,670
And when she saw that Mrs Dayal
was being strangled...

1137
02:11:12,150 --> 02:11:14,769
she returned, forgetting her
duty towards humanity.

1138
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:22,580
Ms. Shanti, after that Mr. Prakash
started following you. Why?

1139
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:26,620
He thought I knew
some of his secrets.

1140
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:28,820
- But you didn't know any?
- No.

1141
02:11:29,110 --> 02:11:32,309
- Did you tell him?
- I didn't get the chance.

1142
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:35,339
- Or you felt it wasn't necessary.
- What?

1143
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:38,020
Because the victim was before you
and you had the revolver.

1144
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:41,480
Because in a moment you would
get rid of all your problems.

1145
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:44,219
That's wrong.
I didn't kill him on purpose.

1146
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:47,670
Every criminal standing here
says the same thing.

1147
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:50,220
"I'm innocent.
I didn't kill anyone."

1148
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:53,269
But the law has exposed
each and every crime.

1149
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:56,470
Isn't it true that you
killed Mr. Prakash?

1150
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:09,220
Yes. Maybe I killed him.

1151
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:11,160
You're not sure?

1152
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:19,570
Because I don't remember
firing on him.

1153
02:12:20,170 --> 02:12:23,350
When one gets furious,
he doesn't remember anything.

1154
02:12:24,530 --> 02:12:26,240
My Lord and the members of the jury...

1155
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:29,150
the convict's statement given
to the police is false.

1156
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:33,300
The convict wants to prove
she fired in her own defense.

1157
02:12:33,690 --> 02:12:37,000
Had this been true, then Mr. Prakash's
dead body wouldn't have disappeared.

1158
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:40,800
This proves that she
had an accomplice.

1159
02:12:41,310 --> 02:12:44,080
If so, then this murder
was pre-planned.

1160
02:12:44,460 --> 02:12:47,240
And if so, then the question of
defending herself doesn't arise.

1161
02:12:47,530 --> 02:12:51,900
The convict murdered Mr. Prakash
to avenge her father's death.

1162
02:12:52,540 --> 02:12:55,700
Mr. Digambar had fought with
Mr. Prakash prior to his death.

1163
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:57,500
That very night he passed away.

1164
02:12:57,560 --> 02:13:01,260
And that very moment the convict
thought of murdering Prakash.

1165
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:06,200
Sir, this was not an accident.
It was pre-planned.

1166
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:10,690
Look at her face.
She has confessed her crime.

1167
02:13:11,020 --> 02:13:14,680
But she doesn't repent.
She killed her sister's husband.

1168
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:19,460
But she's not ashamed at all.
Such a murderer, sinner...

1169
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:24,309
and a criminal should be
sentenced to death.

1170
02:13:27,450 --> 02:13:30,400
Does the defense lawyer
wish to interrogate?

1171
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:34,690
- No my Lord.
- The court is adjourned.

1172
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:41,720
- Why didn't you interrogate?
- No use Mr. Ramesh.

1173
02:13:42,330 --> 02:13:45,010
The case has become weak
after Ms. Shanti's confession.

1174
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:48,910
- You mean, you won't do anything?
- We can plead for mercy.

1175
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:53,160
- Before the judgment?
- Ramesh, you're a lawyer.

1176
02:13:53,770 --> 02:13:57,280
The world will wait for judgment. But
we know what that judgement will be.

1177
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:01,080
- What?
- Death.

1178
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:16,810
I'll pay you whatever you
demand. Just save Shanti.

1179
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:21,090
It's not in my hands to save
her. It's a lost case.

1180
02:14:21,650 --> 02:14:23,170
She has confessed her crime.

1181
02:14:29,060 --> 02:14:32,250
I regret, to what extent will
you deceive the law?

1182
02:14:33,070 --> 02:14:35,110
The most renowned of lawyers
can't save your Shanti.

1183
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:44,349
You're the most renowned lawyer
of the city. If you wish...

1184
02:14:44,390 --> 02:14:46,470
you can prove the allegations
of the police baseless.

1185
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:48,740
No lawyer can save Shanti
from being hanged.

1186
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:50,950
I'll earn a bad name
if I accept this case.

1187
02:15:12,410 --> 02:15:16,010
- Will I be hanged?
- No! You are innocent.

1188
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:20,200
The Lord never punishes
the innocent, Shanti.

1189
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:27,019
Don't have so much trust on my life.
You will only find despair.

1190
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,350
- You'll go mad with grief.
- What are you saying?

1191
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:40,220
I thought I lost you.
You're no longer mine.

1192
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:46,320
- If only it were possible.
- What are you saying?

1193
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:53,370
It would have been easier to
die without you. But not now.

1194
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:55,010
Don't cry. No...

1195
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:04,090
I'm not crying for myself.
I feel sad for you.

1196
02:16:06,670 --> 02:16:09,430
How will you bear to hear
me being executed?

1197
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,146
How will you be
distanced from me?

1198
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:17,000
Don't talk like that.
No one can separate us.

1199
02:16:17,490 --> 02:16:22,179
I'll save you. I'll fight the
law for you till the last moment.

1200
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:24,880
Until my dying breath
I'll pray for you.

1201
02:16:25,570 --> 02:16:29,700
But still, if I'm unable to
save you, you won't die alone.

1202
02:16:30,610 --> 02:16:32,400
You'll find me with you.

1203
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:52,690
Ramu in your statement you said
that on the night of the murder...

1204
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:56,210
you saw a woman following
a man in the garden.

1205
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:58,680
Can you identify them?

1206
02:17:59,049 --> 02:18:06,320
I couldn't see the man.
But yes, forgive me dear.

1207
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,860
I swear by the holy book,
I won't lie even for my daughter.

1208
02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:15,379
You were chasing that
man with a gun.

1209
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:17,639
Your witness please.

1210
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:28,590
Where were you employed earlier?

1211
02:18:29,129 --> 02:18:33,869
- In Benaras.
- And you were arrested for a murder there.

1212
02:18:34,650 --> 02:18:36,389
You were imprisoned for five years.

1213
02:18:37,379 --> 02:18:39,369
- Is it true?
- Yes.

1214
02:18:42,290 --> 02:18:45,730
Mr. Khanna, how were you so sure
that Mr. Prakash was dead?

1215
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:49,160
He wasn't breathing
and had no pulse.

1216
02:18:49,879 --> 02:18:52,980
You aren't a doctor.
How can you prove...

1217
02:18:53,070 --> 02:18:54,760
the ability to examine a person?

1218
02:18:55,629 --> 02:18:57,889
- I don't have any.
- If not, then isn't it possible...

1219
02:18:57,950 --> 02:19:00,030
you might make
a mistake while examining?

1220
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:02,809
- It's possible.
- If that's true...

1221
02:19:02,910 --> 02:19:04,969
then can it be possible that
Mr. Prakash isn't dead?

1222
02:19:05,510 --> 02:19:09,920
Now when we assume him to be
dead, he might be alive.

1223
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:13,410
Just like you and me.
Isn't it possible?

1224
02:19:15,090 --> 02:19:16,290
Quite possible.

1225
02:19:18,968 --> 02:19:22,528
Mrs. Dayal, when did you come
to know of the murder?

1226
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,860
Around midnight. I was thirsty.

1227
02:19:28,910 --> 02:19:33,240
I came downstairs to get water.
The door opened all of a sudden.

1228
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:38,146
And lnsp. Khanna entered
holding Shanti's hand. I saw...

1229
02:19:38,170 --> 02:19:43,420
One minute. Was the door of your
house opened at midnight?

1230
02:19:43,670 --> 02:19:47,290
Yes. Probably my servant, Ramu,
forgot to lock it.

1231
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:51,760
- Was it Ramu or someone else?
- What do you mean?

1232
02:19:52,060 --> 02:19:54,689
You might have gone out
and forgot to lock the door.

1233
02:19:56,310 --> 02:19:59,060
Since my husband's death
I've never stepped outside.

1234
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:03,720
- At least not at night.
- Anyway, what happened later?

1235
02:20:05,130 --> 02:20:08,449
Insp. Khanna told me everything.

1236
02:20:09,890 --> 02:20:12,010
My servant Ramu, too,
came there when he heard this.

1237
02:20:13,630 --> 02:20:16,470
Insp. Khanna wanted
to call the police station.

1238
02:20:17,410 --> 02:20:22,260
- That's why we went upstairs.
- Excuse me, who went upstairs?

1239
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:28,730
- I, Mr. Khanna, Shanti and Ramu.
- Ramu, too?

1240
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:31,680
- Yes.
- But Khanna's report states...

1241
02:20:31,730 --> 02:20:33,789
that only he, you and Shanti
went upstairs.

1242
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:37,580
There was no one else.
When you all came down...

1243
02:20:37,860 --> 02:20:40,640
Ramu was not to be seen.
He didn't even go along with...

1244
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:44,120
you all to the room from where
Mr. Prakash had disappeared.

1245
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:51,796
Possible. I was scared.
And I forgot whether Ramu...

1246
02:20:51,820 --> 02:20:55,119
- was there with me all the while.
- But Mr. Khanna didn't forget.

1247
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:59,689
He fulfilled his duty. His report
states Ramu wasn't with you.

1248
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:04,600
The reason being, he was
finishing your incomplete work.

1249
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:08,010
Because you killed Mr. Prakash!

1250
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:12,330
If your accusations turn out
to be false, you'll be responsible.

1251
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:14,199
- Certainly.
- The proof, please.

1252
02:21:14,430 --> 02:21:20,380
Alright. Ms. Chanchal, when Mr. Khanna
saw the dead body and Ms. Shanti...

1253
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:23,930
it's clear the round should've
been fired at Prakash's chest.

1254
02:21:24,630 --> 02:21:28,560
But the reports say the round
was found below the chest.

1255
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:30,700
Can you tell me why?

1256
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:33,420
The witness can't answer
this question.

1257
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:35,580
When the murder took place,
the door was closed.

1258
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:38,869
There was no one else inside
besides Prakash and Shanti.

1259
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:41,949
That's what I want to say.
There was no one else in the room.

1260
02:21:42,900 --> 02:21:45,880
But there was someone outside.
The doors were closed.

1261
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:49,330
But the door needn't be
open to fire at someone.

1262
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:53,370
It should be noted the glass
of the right window was broken.

1263
02:21:53,950 --> 02:21:55,900
The police report states
the round was...

1264
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:57,980
found on the right side
below the chest.

1265
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:02,550
If this is true, then Ms Shanti
didn't fire at him but...

1266
02:22:02,590 --> 02:22:05,570
someone else who stood on the
right side near the window.

1267
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:09,210
And the one who stood near the
window ran inside the house...

1268
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:12,320
and forgot to lock the door.
When the lnsp. was making the call...

1269
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:17,096
her servant carried
the dead body and was trying...

1270
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:20,850
hard to save his mistress
from the clutches of the law.

1271
02:22:23,650 --> 02:22:27,350
Tell me, why would
Ms. Chanchal murder him?

1272
02:22:28,170 --> 02:22:30,610
What would she gain
by killing Mr. Prakash?

1273
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:34,130
I would like to have
permission to question her.

1274
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:35,600
Permission granted.

1275
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:46,340
Mrs. Dayal, are you positive you
never loved anyone except Mr. Dayal?

1276
02:22:50,020 --> 02:22:51,360
I will repeat.

1277
02:22:55,810 --> 02:22:58,656
The defense lawyer shouldn't concern
himself with the witness's personal life.

1278
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:00,530
It's against the law.

1279
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:07,050
I believe you know the conclusions
arising from such questions.

1280
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:11,850
An innocent's life depends
on these questions.

1281
02:23:12,230 --> 02:23:14,730
I'll request the court to permit
me to ask the questions.

1282
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:16,400
You may proceed.

1283
02:23:20,390 --> 02:23:26,529
Are you sure you haven't loved
anyone besides Mr. Dayal?

1284
02:23:28,450 --> 02:23:35,240
I swear by the holy book,
my deceased husband was my lord.

1285
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:37,420
I didn't ask about the Lord.

1286
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:43,529
Anyway, did Mr. Dayal have
an affair with another woman?

1287
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:47,300
That's a lie! I won't hear
anything against my husband.

1288
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:50,356
- Don't defame him.
- You want to say...

1289
02:23:50,380 --> 02:23:52,820
- Mr. Dayal only loved you.
- Certainly!

1290
02:23:52,930 --> 02:23:54,816
- He trusted you, your love.
- Yes!

1291
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:56,890
- He didn't doubt you?
- Not at all!

1292
02:23:57,410 --> 02:24:00,730
Then why did he disown you
in his will?

1293
02:24:01,190 --> 02:24:03,186
Why did he accuse you of
being a wanton woman?

1294
02:24:03,210 --> 02:24:05,869
Why did he prove you to be
untrustworthy and a cheat?

1295
02:24:06,050 --> 02:24:07,920
That's a lie, a blatant lie!

1296
02:24:08,370 --> 02:24:10,450
But Mr. Dayal's statement
can't be false.

1297
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:16,126
This is Mr. Dayal's will.
In this he has accused...

1298
02:24:16,150 --> 02:24:19,230
his wife of being unchaste.
And he disowned her.

1299
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:28,640
Can the defense lawyer tell us
how he got Mr. Dayal's will?

1300
02:24:28,890 --> 02:24:31,519
Before revealing this secret
I'd like to request the...

1301
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:34,080
court to permit me to ask
Ms. Chanchal some more questions.

1302
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:35,900
You may proceed.

1303
02:24:38,890 --> 02:24:41,349
Just answer in yes or no.

1304
02:24:42,230 --> 02:24:44,810
- Did you know about this will?
- No

1305
02:24:44,940 --> 02:24:46,930
- Did Mr. Prakash know?
- I don't know.

1306
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:50,420
You both were on a picnic when
the mishap occurred.

1307
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:52,520
- Yes
- There was nobody else.

1308
02:24:52,830 --> 02:24:55,720
- No.
- Then who punctured the car's tires with a knife?

1309
02:24:56,380 --> 02:24:57,856
- Answer me!
- I don't know.

1310
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:01,666
Since the tires were flat, you
both wished to go in the boat.

1311
02:25:01,690 --> 02:25:04,590
- Yes.
- The boat was ready but the boatman wasn't around?

1312
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,010
- That's right.
- Do you know how to swim? - Yes.

1313
02:25:07,090 --> 02:25:08,626
- Mr. Dayal didn't know?
- No.

1314
02:25:08,650 --> 02:25:12,900
But the person that
punctured the tires knew it.

1315
02:25:13,010 --> 02:25:14,810
He arranged for the boat
and the oars.

1316
02:25:14,890 --> 02:25:17,776
He pushed Mr. Dayal
into the water with your help.

1317
02:25:17,800 --> 02:25:19,500
- While he was drowning...
- That's a lie!

1318
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:21,860
- I was all alone there.
- You said that before, too.

1319
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:24,980
And everyone believed you.
But today they won't.

1320
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:28,960
Mr. Prakash was there with you.
This boatman is the proof.

1321
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:32,910
- He's the boatman.
- This is deception.

1322
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:36,130
Mr. Ramesh has bribed the boatman
to speak against me.

1323
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:41,199
As long as God protects the innocent,
I need not bribe anyone.

1324
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:44,380
You can hide your crimes...

1325
02:25:44,910 --> 02:25:47,830
but the blood of the innocent
one reveals the murderer.

1326
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:49,950
Today is the test between
truth and falsehood.

1327
02:25:50,310 --> 02:25:53,630
And the law says Mr. Prakash
killed Mr. Dayal.

1328
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:55,380
And you in turn killed Mr. Prakash.

1329
02:25:55,560 --> 02:25:58,750
Mr. Dayal was murdered
because of the will he made.

1330
02:25:59,050 --> 02:26:02,279
And Mr. Prakash was killed because
he had this will.

1331
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:04,650
And because he was
blackmailing you for money.

1332
02:26:05,660 --> 02:26:09,190
You didn't kill Mr. Dayal,
but he was killed with your help.

1333
02:26:09,260 --> 02:26:10,870
And at your behest.

1334
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:16,050
I would like to remind the court
this case is related to...

1335
02:26:16,130 --> 02:26:18,509
Mr. Prakash's murder and not
with Mr. Dayal's death.

1336
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:21,960
The defense lawyer with his
wild imagination and...

1337
02:26:22,330 --> 02:26:24,100
statements has invented a strange story.

1338
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:26,529
But he hasn't presented any proof.

1339
02:26:26,990 --> 02:26:31,270
Whatever he said about Mr. Dayal's
death might be true to some extent.

1340
02:26:31,770 --> 02:26:37,280
But how can we ignore the fact
that Ms. Shanti murdered Prakash?

1341
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:42,120
It's true that the glass of the
right window was broken...

1342
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:45,170
and he was fired on the right
side. But this is a coincidence.

1343
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:48,940
This can create a doubt,
but can't hide the reality.

1344
02:26:49,210 --> 02:26:51,740
The convict has confessed her crime.

1345
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:54,230
Only the two of them
were present in the room.

1346
02:26:54,510 --> 02:26:57,460
There's no proof of Ms. Chanchal
being outside the room.

1347
02:26:58,130 --> 02:27:00,720
My friend,
the defense lawyer's statements...

1348
02:27:01,070 --> 02:27:03,310
and his dramatic representations
can't save the criminal.

1349
02:27:03,750 --> 02:27:07,590
It has been proved that
Ms. Shanti is the criminal.

1350
02:27:11,490 --> 02:27:14,520
Has the defense lawyer
anything more to say?

1351
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:23,960
It's been said that Mr. Prakash
came to seek refuge in your compound.

1352
02:27:24,930 --> 02:27:27,960
Can you tell me why he came
to your place and nowhere else?

1353
02:27:28,330 --> 02:27:31,800
Mr. Prakash could give you
the answer were he still alive.

1354
02:27:32,210 --> 02:27:33,609
Were he still alive?

1355
02:27:33,830 --> 02:27:38,830
- You, too, are sure he's dead?
- Everyone believes it but you.

1356
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:41,340
Maybe I'm wrong.

1357
02:27:41,730 --> 02:27:46,000
Last night while strolling outside
your place I saw something strange.

1358
02:27:47,050 --> 02:27:49,759
You know there's a old stable
in your compound?

1359
02:27:50,030 --> 02:27:53,680
I saw someone
coming out of the stable.

1360
02:27:53,860 --> 02:27:56,620
He jumped in the garden and escaped.
He was wearing a black outfit.

1361
02:27:56,680 --> 02:27:58,376
He was limping and used a cane.

1362
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:02,480
- Just like Mr. Prakash.
- That's a lie. Nonsense!

1363
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:06,800
No! This is the fact.
Else I wouldn't get this will.

1364
02:28:07,270 --> 02:28:10,530
The law can do injustice,
hang an innocent person.

1365
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:12,920
But you know who fired on Prakash.

1366
02:28:13,530 --> 02:28:17,300
But the one you thought
to be dead is still alive!

1367
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:19,920
Along with it, lives the
law and justice!

1368
02:28:20,430 --> 02:28:21,930
Don't trust me? Look there!

1369
02:28:34,520 --> 02:28:37,740
He's here to give a statement
for the sin you committed.

1370
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:42,570
The power of justice has
exposed every lie.

1371
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:46,509
Every criminal who tried to
hoodwink the law...

1372
02:28:46,790 --> 02:28:50,090
has been hanged to death.
The law is the ultimate proof...

1373
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:51,820
that a criminal cannot
overcome the law.

1374
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:55,520
And today the law and justice
will not spare you.

1375
02:28:55,960 --> 02:28:58,830
Look at him. He's the one
on whom you fired.

1376
02:28:59,140 --> 02:29:02,430
You said, he was dead.
He was your accomplice.

1377
02:29:03,220 --> 02:29:05,609
No one can lie by the holy book.

1378
02:29:05,790 --> 02:29:07,686
If one does
his life becomes a living hell.

1379
02:29:07,710 --> 02:29:09,109
Speak, who's the murderer?

1380
02:29:09,150 --> 02:29:13,130
Or Prakash will reveal all your secrets.
Who is the murderer, speak up!

1381
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:17,070
Or Prakash will expose you.
Who's the murderer, speak up?

1382
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:20,840
- Or Prakash's murderer...
- Yes, I fired on him!

1383
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:25,510
I tried to kill you because
you killed my husband.

1384
02:29:26,480 --> 02:29:30,039
You can't harm me. Stop!

1385
02:29:42,910 --> 02:29:45,970
You're right Ms. Chanchal.
Mr. Prakash is dead.

1386
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:48,650
His body lies at the same
place where you hid it.

1387
02:29:49,030 --> 02:29:53,490
My Lord, Ms. Chanchal has
confessed her crime. That's all.

1388
02:29:57,660 --> 02:30:01,789
Since Ms Chanchal has confessed,
the court orders the police...

1389
02:30:01,820 --> 02:30:03,520
to take her into custody immediately.

1390
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:07,510
And Ms. Shanti,
you are free to go.

1391
02:30:30,810 --> 02:30:33,350
God be praised,
you agreed with me

1392
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:38,170
And my world is alright again

1393
02:30:46,360 --> 02:30:50,130
I made you laugh,
taught you to love

1394
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:56,880
Won't you at least
say 'thank you'?

1395
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:01,019
I know you didn't call me...

1396
02:31:01,630 --> 02:31:04,949
but is my company so intolerable?

1397
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:08,790
I just came along
but you ignore me

1398
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:12,340
God, you're something else!
