1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
29.970

2
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,296
It's the festival of colours!
' Holi' is here!

3
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,185
Aunt! Best Wishes on ' Holi'!

4
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,814
That's enough!
- Give me one more 'jalebi' to eat!

5
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,568
Where's uncle?
- Over there.

6
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,573
I am here!
- Best Wishes on ' Holi'!

7
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:41,786
How can you play ' Holi' with me?

8
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:46,166
Send your grandpa here,
I'll play with him.

9
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,877
Is that so?

10
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,550
Grandpa! Grandpa!!

11
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,721
Why are you screaming
so much, early in the...

12
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,977
Grandpa!
- No! I've just had a bath!

13
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,731
You look stark white! Shall
I make you a bit colourful?!

14
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,153
Stay away from me!
- I won't heed you today!

15
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:19,949
I'm too old to play!
- Age is no bar for colours!

16
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,660
' Holi' comes only once a year!

17
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,789
Just a little on the face!

18
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:34,130
Best Wishes on ' Holi'!

19
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,258
Best Wishes on ' Holi', grandpa!
- Best wishes, my child!

20
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,140
You look so good, grandpa! Really!

21
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,979
Imagine how dull our lives
would be without colours.

22
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,984
I mean, it would be so
lacklustre and depressing, right?

23
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:29,185
Blessings, mother.
- Bless you.

24
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:42,115
Dear God, I cannot change the
colour of my mother's clothes.

25
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:49,622
But make me worthy of bestowing
the colour of joy on her face.

26
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,969
You pray so ardently to God,
but He can't even find me a job!

27
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,680
It's no big deal for Him, is it?

28
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,396
It's a ' Holi' today. So pray that I
get chosen in the interview tomorrow.

29
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:20,278
Why not? What does my son lack?
Just don't give up.

30
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:50,934
You're back, son? Don't lose heart.
Everything will be fine.

31
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:58,024
Look, I have ticked
two vacancies here.

32
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,361
So, you knew I wouldn't get the job?

33
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:07,409
Keep trying.
- That's what I'm doing.

34
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:12,205
I'll try here also. I'll leave now.
Mother must be waiting.

35
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,921
That's 400.

36
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,931
I'll be back.

37
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,649
What happened?
- I didn't get this job either.

38
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:45,572
No problem. God will give you
a fantastic job, that's why...

39
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:49,534
That's why He's not giving
me an ordinary one! Right?

40
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,790
But where is that
fantastic job? When will I get it?

41
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,587
Don't lose heart.

42
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:06,843
Oh yes! Take this.
- What's this?

43
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,805
Mr. Kapoor's son,
Ranjit, has come from America.

44
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,768
He has?
- He's brought this for you.

45
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,730
I'll go and meet him.
- First freshen up and eat.

46
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,735
Call your son Ranjit.

47
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:28,531
Let me also see how he looks
after returning from America.

48
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,702
Blessings, uncle.
- Bless you.

49
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:37,916
You will choke if you smoke a
cigarette instead of ' hookah'.

50
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,670
That's not the case. This is
my second packet since morning.

51
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,257
My son has brought a
carton of cigarettes for me.

52
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,968
Do you know which brand this is?
- Which? - Malbaro!

53
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,850
Only the rich smoke it. My
son has also become affluent.

54
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:00,647
He owns an apartment, a
car and has his own business.

55
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,401
And my
daughter-in-law is a white lady!

56
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:10,657
My, my! May God give
everybody an admirable son like him!

57
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,828
Your son, Ranjit, has got up.

58
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,292
Hey, Ranjit!

59
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:27,340
How are you? You've grown so big!
- Fine. So have you

60
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,677
Water.
- Mother, Rohan looks so good!

61
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,890
How happy your mother appears!
- And how are you?

62
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,601
Tell me about yourself, as you
have returned after so many years.

63
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,024
It's too crowded here. Let's
go somewhere else and chat.

64
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,697
America is something else!

65
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,034
By the way, keep my card.

66
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,370
If you happen to come to
New York, then do meet me.

67
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,835
But your name is Ranjit Kapoor.
- I have shortened my name.

68
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,755
Roney Cooper!

69
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,134
You have indeed become an
affluent man after going to America!

70
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,845
Did you find some magic wand?

71
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:19,684
America is a land of enchantment!
Look at me! What was I here?

72
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:24,064
I failed thrice in Class VIII. My
parents would scold me everyday.

73
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,192
One fine day, I worked my way out,
and escaped to America.

74
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,031
Look at me now. What do I lack? I
have a house, a car and a business.

75
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:38,870
I'll take my parents too
this time, and make them rest.

76
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,790
What are you doing?

77
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,629
Nothing. After graduation, I did a
diploma in computers in 1st division.

78
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,008
And now, I'm wandering for a job.
- A job?

79
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:58,890
You don't get jobs here. And even
if you do, how much will you earn?

80
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,687
5,000? 7,000? I blow up so
much of money in a day there!

81
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,232
I feel sorry looking at your state!

82
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:14,531
Just look at the difference in the
currencies. Rs.40 is equal to $1!

83
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:20,995
So, every American is 40
times richer than an Indian.

84
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,792
And there's no dearth of jobs.
Earn as much as you work!

85
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,294
Just think.

86
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:34,968
Had I been educated, I'd have been
wandering for a job today as you are.

87
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:58,742
No, mother. I have made up my mind
about not staying in this country.

88
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,078
I want to go to America.

89
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:07,083
What are you saying! There's
no place like one's own country!

90
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:17,719
One has to wander hopelessly to
find a job even after being educated.

91
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,430
Is this a country?

92
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,355
Since the time I met Ranjit...

93
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:38,365
...I have been thinking all along,
what is it that I lack?

94
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:47,123
It's my misfortune that I've
been born in this country.

95
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:52,754
Don't speak like that, son. By
God's grace, we have everything.

96
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:57,133
As regards your job, you will
surely get one, sooner or later.

97
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:03,390
I ask you, how much will I
earn even if I do get a job?

98
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,812
5,000? 7,000? At the most, 10,000.

99
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,689
What kind of a future will I have?

100
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:20,490
For my education and my future,
grandpa and you...

101
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,869
...sold all the property,
house and shop in Azamgadh.

102
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,623
And bought this old house in Delhi.

103
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,922
I'll get married someday, have kids.

104
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:40,593
I'll have to then sell this house,
and rent a place to make their future!

105
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,098
Why do you think that way?
- One has to think, mother.

106
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,477
Look at Ranjit. He is
well-settled in America today.

107
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,440
Had he not left from here, he'd have
been working as a peon in some place!

108
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,985
He has failed in Class VIII.

109
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:01,865
Whereas I'm educated. I
can earn much more than him!

110
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,618
There are millions of
youngsters like you here.

111
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,957
If they also begin to think like you
there won't be any youngsters left!

112
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,668
What can I do if they don't think so?!

113
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:19,716
If they want to stay here amidst
the crowd and poverty, then let them!

114
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,218
But I don't want to stay here!

115
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,223
Mother, I want to make it big!
I want to make money!

116
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,233
I want to progress in life!

117
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,196
And you want me to sit in
the shop, and ruin my life!

118
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,907
What's wrong with the shop?!

119
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,912
Because of it, I raised you,
educated you, and got you married!

120
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,206
Now, you refuse to sit in that shop?!

121
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,000
The problem is that you
just don't understand!

122
00:13:54,793 --> 00:14:00,590
You live life the way you want to
but don't let your kids do the same!

123
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:06,012
The world has moved ahead,
but you turn a blind eye to it!

124
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,349
Shut up, you insolent man!

125
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:13,520
For God's sake, don't fight
with him! Heed your father!

126
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,691
Firstly, you imposed her on me!
I didn't want to marry now!

127
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,861
But you said, you'd given your word!
And then, the burden of this child!

128
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,364
Don't you dare say so!

129
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,991
Suppose, I had thrown you away
thinking you to be a burden, then?

130
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,619
Then, do so now! I
will be obligated to you!

131
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:35,000
If I leave this place, I'll be
able to do something! Come on!

132
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,711
No! I won't leave father!

133
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,298
Fine! I'll leave then!
From now on, I'm dead for you!

134
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,384
Listen! Father!

135
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,726
I want to progress in life!

136
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,896
And you want me to sit in
the shop, and ruin my life!

137
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:21,504
Just think. Does it look good for
you to work when you have a young son?

138
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,675
For grandpa to work in his old age?

139
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,931
And then, it's my duty
to serve grandpa and you.

140
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,145
Look at Ranjit. He's
taken his parents.

141
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,524
They must be living a
peaceful life there now.

142
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,653
Let me go, mother.

143
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,240
Don't be stubborn,
Rohan. I get very frightened.

144
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,369
Your father once did
the same, and he...

145
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:57,374
That was an accident!
Accidents don't occur every time!

146
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,673
Let me go.

147
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:10,512
It isn't easy going to America. I
have to make a passport, get a visa.

148
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,640
Let him go.

149
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,811
Let him go.

150
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,773
Father?!

151
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,863
Make arrangements to leave, son.

152
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,745
I'll arrange the money
for your plane tickets.

153
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,167
Grandpa!

154
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,386
Father!

155
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,017
Why did you let him go?

156
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,022
He is stubborn like his father.

157
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,069
I have lost my son.

158
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,534
I don't want to lose my grandson now.

159
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,790
Grandpa!

160
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,378
Take care, mother.

161
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:34,346
Don't worry about us. I'll tend
to her. You take care of yourself.

162
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,222
Okay.

163
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:41,853
What worries me is, how
will you live there alone?

164
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:46,858
Hey! I'm not alone, mother.
I have grandpa's blessings.

165
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,195
And then, I have this around my neck.

166
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,116
You will always be with me.

167
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:02,499
No trouble can come near
me when I have them both.

168
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:09,381
Air India, Flight No.111 is ready
for departure to London & New York.

169
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:15,220
Passengers are requested to
board the flight through the doorway.

170
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,514
Thank you.

171
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,433
I'll leave, grandpa.

172
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,021
Bless you.

173
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,664
We will be landing in New York now.

174
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,584
You are requested to put your
seat in an upright position...

175
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:31,338
...wear your seat belt
and shut the tray table.

176
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:36,343
Passengers staying back here, please
see that the form is filled properly.

177
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:40,096
Please keep the boarding card
ready while alighting the flight.

178
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,765
Thank you.

179
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,734
What are you doing!

180
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,279
I am a taxi driver. It's my
duty to carry this baggage.

181
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,242
It becomes my duty
because I am younger than you.

182
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,995
In today's times, it's better that
each person carries his own burden.

183
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,081
As you wish.

184
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,754
I'm very pleased to meet you.

185
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,508
Looking at your
beliefs and upbringing...

186
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:04,139
...you appear to be from a very
good family. Are you from India?

187
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,101
Yes. Are you also an Indian?

188
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,272
When the countries were one,
I was also an Indian.

189
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:19,446
But after the partition, I became
a Pakistani, and you, an Indian.

190
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,282
My name is Sardar Khan.

191
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,621
Glad to meet you. Have
you come to tour the place?

192
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,415
No. To work.

193
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,211
Is your job at the motel
where you're going to, confirmed?

194
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:42,260
It's a neighbour's motel. I'll
stay there, and find a job too.

195
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,014
There comes your motel.

196
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,975
How much is it, Brother Sardar?

197
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,312
You call me a brother,
yet speak of money?

198
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,691
But a younger brother cannot make
his elder brother incur losses, right?

199
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,402
Please tell me.

200
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,905
14.60.

201
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,701
Take this.
- Good Lord! $100!

202
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,829
Had I earned so much,
I'd have been back home!

203
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,166
I don't have change.
- I'll get some from Ranjit.

204
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,294
Fine. I'll park the cab ahead.
- Okay.

205
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,093
Hey! You want a room?

206
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,595
Sorry. - You want a girl?

207
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,847
No. - 100 bucks, 50 bucks!

208
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,601
No, is Ronny in? Ronny Cooper!

209
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,020
Ronny?
- Yeah, Ronny.

210
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,523
Ronny!

211
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,447
Ya, ok, I'll get
back to you very soon.

212
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,119
Hey, Rohan! - Ranjeet!

213
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,623
You have completely changed!
- When did you come?

214
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:57,794
I've come straight from
the Airport. How are you?

215
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,922
Me? Let's go out.

216
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,050
How are your parents?
- Very well.

217
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,761
They must be resting at home.
Tell me about yourself.

218
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:12,809
What do I say? You said, there are
many jobs in America, so here I am.

219
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:17,814
That was wise! But remember, people
change drastically after coming here.

220
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,568
But don't you change! Meet me
once in a week or a fortnight.

221
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,696
And if you can't meet me,
then do phone, okay?

222
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:30,118
Joke later. First, give me some
change to give the taxi driver.

223
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:36,374
I am not joking. If you let go of
the cab, where will you get another?

224
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,919
This is a highway. One finds a
taxi here with great difficulty.

225
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:47,010
What are you saying! I
have come here because of you.

226
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,555
I don't know anybody
else here other than you.

227
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:56,186
I didn't come here because of
anyone and neither did I know anybody!

228
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,565
Where will I go then?
Where will I stay?

229
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,944
Rohan, I don't have a place.

230
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,789
Uncle!

231
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,969
What's wrong?!

232
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,723
What was that? What was that noise?

233
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,477
You stupid idiot!

234
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,188
You have broken so
many dishes this week...

235
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:42,065
...who is going to pay for them? Me?

236
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,692
Dear! - You idiot!

237
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:47,487
Please don't scold him!
I'll clean the place.

238
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,073
You better clean this mess up.

239
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:59,374
Who was the woman who scolded your
parents? And you just listened?!

240
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:05,422
She's my wife Melanie. And if
she is scolding them, she is right.

241
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:12,512
You had brought them here,
saying you'd serve them.

242
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:19,811
Wow! You sure are serving them!
I spit on children like you!

243
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:26,693
They are my parents. I'll make them
do anything! Who are you to stop me?!

244
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,864
They work less but the
losses they cause are much more!

245
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,949
Then, send them back.

246
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:36,494
If workers were cheaply
and easily available here...

247
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,540
...I would have never spent so
much money, and brought them here!

248
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:45,045
Indeed! And I have
seen how you make money!

249
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,798
If you are so offended,
then why don't you leave?

250
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:15,492
Have you heard of the adage, the
one who has no one has the Lord?

251
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,037
Come on, I'll
introduce you to ' India' now.

252
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:25,710
Amazing! You think I'll keep any
stranger you pick on the road?!

253
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:29,255
Is this a house or a guest house?!
- Why are you talking gibberish?

254
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:33,009
He is from your country.
He is a decent boy.

255
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,512
His friend deceived him.

256
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,848
Now, who will help him in this
vast foreign land if I don't?

257
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:42,185
Did he take a visa from me?!
Let him go anywhere!

258
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,147
Stop this rubbish! Even I have
an equal right over that house!

259
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:49,275
So do I!
- The boy will stay here!

260
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,778
I say, he will not!
- He will stay here!

261
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:54,698
He will not!
- Then I'll go away from here!

262
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:59,369
If he stays, then I'll leave!
- Is that so?! Chaurasia!

263
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,540
What is the matter?

264
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:08,878
Settle my account. I'm leaving!
- Settle the account? I see!

265
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:12,215
My dear Mrs.

266
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,926
Did you call me, my dear mister?

267
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:20,140
I think war has broken out again
between ' India' and ' Pakistan'.

268
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,268
Again!

269
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:28,064
Now, I'll have to go to the border,
and call for a ceasefire!

270
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:36,406
They keep fighting and
harassing my dear mister!

271
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:38,700
I won't stay here!

272
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:46,416
Brother India and Brother Pakistan,
why are you fighting today?

273
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:50,587
Chaurasia, brother, this is America.

274
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:55,800
Is it right to keep an
unidentified stranger in your house?

275
00:27:57,469 --> 00:28:03,308
What nonsense! If the stranger is
decent, worried, from your country...

276
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:07,062
...and if he knows nobody here,
then shouldn't you help him?!

277
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:11,024
Yes, you certainly should.
But who is he?

278
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:17,280
That's him. His name is Rohan.
I have given him my word.

279
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:28,458
When Brother Pakistan has given
his word, let the poor boy stay!

280
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:36,883
Suppose your younger brother
happens to come to America.

281
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:43,139
And he also meets with
the same fate as this boy.

282
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:48,353
For example, he sleeps on the
streets, the cops take him away...

283
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:53,149
...he sheds tears in the police
station, and sings only one song...

284
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:58,571
'Wish there was someone
whom I could call my own... '

285
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,325
That's enough. Stop being so
senti or I'll become mental!

286
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,870
Come on, pick up the baggage.
- Thank you, brother, 'India'.

287
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:13,586
Hey, I mediated the peace talks,
and you thank only ' India'!

288
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:20,051
Anyway, I'm Sarhadilal Chaurasia.
You are Rohan...

289
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,637
Khanna. - Rohan Khanna!

290
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,639
Nice to see you in America.

291
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:29,853
Come in. This is our humble home.

292
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:35,275
Why are you calling a palace, a
humble home, in front of him?!

293
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,194
I was only trying to
say something in Urdu!

294
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:43,408
It's remarkable, owning your own
house in a country like America.

295
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:49,873
It's also remarkable that India
and Pakistan have been partitioned...

296
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,958
...but look at things here, in America.

297
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:58,214
Despite minor firings,
they live amicably together!

298
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:04,054
But I can't fathom why you call
yourselves ' India' and ' Pakistan'?

299
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,139
I'll tell.

300
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:10,310
He is a 'Sardar'(Sikh),
whereas my name is Sardar.

301
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:14,564
When people come to ask
for me, they take him away!

302
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:17,817
He is a Muslim, but my name is lqbal.

303
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,528
When someone would ask for me,
he would be taken away!

304
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:26,576
Because of this confusion, they
named themselves India and Pakistan.

305
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:37,087
Hey! Do you drive a taxi, and
repair televisions sets as well?

306
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:43,677
Oh no! These are the trophies of
our love which we have kept securely.

307
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,345
Trophies?

308
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:48,682
In 1991, when India had won the
cricket match against Pakistan...

309
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:52,018
...he had broken this TV in anger.

310
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:57,857
Why accuse me? You had smashed
that TV when Pakistan won in '92!

311
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:00,777
In '92, the umpire had
given a wrong decision!

312
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,531
And this?!
- You had broken this in '94!

313
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:09,536
Rohan, the implication
is that whenever there's...

314
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:14,958
...an India-Pakistan match, one
TV getting smashed is a must!

315
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:20,797
Then how did this one get saved?
- This one?

316
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:23,508
The last match was a draw!

317
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:30,306
Tell us about yourself.
Who lives in India?

318
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,561
My father is no more. I have
a mother and a grandfather.

319
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,897
It'll be late at night in India now.

320
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:42,068
Phone them tomorrow during the day,
and tell them you've reached safely.

321
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:46,239
Yes, do inform them.
- What work do you know?

322
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:49,576
I have a diploma in
computers with a first class.

323
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:54,372
That's fine, but it isn't so
easy getting a good job here.

324
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:58,126
It isn't, even in India.
But I'll surely try.

325
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,671
Do you know driving?
- Yes.

326
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,382
Then start driving a
taxi from tomorrow.

327
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,056
I had thought I'd have a
good job after being educated.

328
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,269
Hey, a job is not good or bad! A
person who works, is respected here!

329
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:22,525
You can't possibly starve until you
get a job of your choice, can you?

330
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,862
So, drive a taxi until then.
And quit, once you get a job.

331
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,113
Yes.

332
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,787
Grandpa, this is Rohan.

333
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:38,375
My dear!

334
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:46,299
Rama, it's Rohan's phone. So,
did you reach safely?

335
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:51,096
Yes. Where is mother? -
She is... It's Rohan's phone.

336
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:00,897
How are you?
- Fine, mother. How are you?

337
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:06,945
Fine. Do you like it there?

338
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,699
Yes. The place is very nice,
and so are the people.

339
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:17,163
Don't waste your money by
phoning often. Write instead.

340
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:22,377
Look after your health,
and don't worry about us.

341
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,714
Okay.

342
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:29,467
I love you, mom!
- Bless you.

343
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,013
He's disconnected.

344
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:40,937
So, he's reached there. I hope
he succeeds in his objective.

345
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,063
First time in New York? - Hm!

346
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,357
Going to be staying long?

347
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:28,902
Okay!

348
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:33,073
She looks pretty, but
I think she is crazy!

349
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:38,912
She probably thinks,
talking will ruin her beauty!

350
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:43,500
Talking too much does
not enhance beauty either!

351
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,088
You're from India?

352
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,552
You don't look like it.
- Stop talking nonsense!

353
00:34:54,761 --> 00:35:01,017
Don't try to get too familiar. I
don't talk to strangers! Okay?

354
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:05,605
And don't think that I am alone.
My brother lives here.

355
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:08,942
Here comes your destination.

356
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:22,288
Pooja! How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

357
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,958
Fine.
- I'd seen your picture.

358
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:28,545
You indeed are very beautiful!
- So are you!

359
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:31,047
How was your flight?
- Good.

360
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,758
You must be tired?
- No. Where is Brother Samir?

361
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:36,469
Sam, come down. Pooja is here.

362
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:40,015
Pooja, my sister, how are you?
- Brother!

363
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:43,143
Why didn't you come to the Airport?
I was so scared.

364
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:47,939
Didn't you meet Mr. Lazzaro?
I'd sent him with your picture.

365
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:52,110
No. - O' God! He must be very worried!

366
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,238
Never mind, come.

367
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,741
Wow! What a house, brother!

368
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:02,120
And tell me, how are you? How
are things in India? - It's okay!

369
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:07,959
The same old poverty and filth!
Is it a country worth staying in?!

370
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:11,921
Indians may be poor, but
they have a heart of gold!

371
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:17,135
Their love, culture, it's
something else altogether!

372
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:22,557
I'll ask you after you've stayed
here. Right, Sam? - Of course, darling!

373
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:29,022
Sam, call Mr. Lazzaro, and
tell him that Pooja has arrived.

374
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,487
Who is Mr. Lazzaro, and why
did you send him to receive me?

375
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:43,620
We wanted you to meet him alone,
talk to him... understand each other.

376
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,956
I don't quite understand.
- I'll explain.

377
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:51,961
We want you to get
married to Mr. Lazzaro.

378
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,298
What!
- Yes.

379
00:36:55,674 --> 00:37:01,137
He's gone crazy seeing your picture.
He was waiting more eagerly than us.

380
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:05,517
But how could you fix my
marriage without my consent?

381
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:10,939
I am your elder brother.
You have nobody else but me.

382
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:16,152
After our parents' death, you
had grandma. But she is no more.

383
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:20,323
Being an elder brother, it's
my duty to get you married.

384
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:25,120
Yes, but...
- You can't find a better match.

385
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:27,831
Do you know he owns three factories?

386
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:30,959
Sam works in his factory.

387
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:36,381
The poor man married twice
but both his wives left him.

388
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:38,675
He is very aggrieved.

389
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:43,471
He'll keep you very happy.
He's also giving Sam a promotion!

390
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,931
Just think!

391
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,893
You'll be the proprietress of the
factory, and me, a Managing Director.

392
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:57,027
Now I understand why you sent me
the tickets, and called me here.

393
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:01,197
Sam.
- Oh! My God, Mr. Lazzaro is here.

394
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:04,117
Sam, I missed her at the airport

395
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,330
Mr. Lazzaro, hi! Pooja,
this is Mr. Lazzaro - Get up.

396
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,207
My sister, my sister, sir!

397
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:24,346
Where are you going? Talk to him.
Else, what's he going to think?

398
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:31,227
I don't want to talk to him.
Tell him that I won't marry him!

399
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,398
Excuse me, sir.

400
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:36,858
What happened?

401
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:41,654
Pooja, what are you doing?!
He is my boss!

402
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:48,119
I've promised him marriage. What
will happen to me if you refuse?!

403
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,873
Let alone a promotion,
he will sack me!

404
00:38:53,541 --> 00:39:01,049
I'd heard that in India, people
give bribes to get their work done.

405
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:08,348
But I didn't know that here, people
give their sisters instead of money!

406
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:15,021
I've made this decision after giving
it much thought. It's for our good!

407
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:17,941
Who are you to decide that?

408
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:22,737
It's my life. I'll decide
whom I want to spend it with!

409
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:28,993
If he has no right over your life,
then why have you come here?!

410
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:34,624
If you want to stay here, you will
have to marry Mr. Lazzaro, okay?!

411
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:38,378
Think about it. Else,
the door is yet open.

412
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,981
What's happening, where is she going?

413
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,400
Don't worry, she'll be back.

414
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:04,654
Yes! Where will she go? She
has no return ticket nor a place!

415
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:11,327
She has nobody else here. She'll
cry a little, and then return.

416
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,832
What's wrong? Are you crying?

417
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:08,885
I admit I am a stranger, I
have no right to ask you.

418
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,847
But for the sake of humanity,
I ask you, what happened?

419
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,393
Isn't your brother at home?

420
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:21,815
Had I known that my
own brother would...

421
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:32,242
So, should I leave you to the Airport?

422
00:41:32,867 --> 00:41:36,830
I don't have a return ticket.
- No problem. We'll buy one.

423
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,749
I don't even have the money!

424
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:53,304
I had met with the same fate. I'll
take you to the ones who'd helped me.

425
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:58,309
I don't want to go anywhere.
Leave me alone!

426
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,940
Do you know anybody else here?

427
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,613
What will you do then?

428
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:16,661
Whatever I'm destined for!
Please go away!

429
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:29,174
There are four paths from this place.

430
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:34,804
One, to your brother's place,
where you don't want to go.

431
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:38,975
Two, to the Airport,
where you cannot go.

432
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:43,146
Three, to the city, where
everybody is a stranger.

433
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:52,739
And the fourth, to my colony,
where everybody will help you.

434
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:00,038
Think about it! The decision is yours.

435
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:05,251
You trusted a brother.

436
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:11,091
Now, trust a stranger, and see.

437
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:02,183
Listen to me first! Is this a
guest house or an orphanage?!

438
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:06,354
You bring anyone here
who has no whereabouts!

439
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:11,151
You will not drive a taxi. If you do,
you will not go to the Airport.

440
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,487
Or you'll bring home
anybody who alights the flight!

441
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:17,198
What nonsense!
- You got this place with difficulty!

442
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:20,118
And now, you bring a new problem!

443
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:32,630
Hey! I didn't tell you anything! Why
are you crying? I was scolding him!

444
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,342
It's not your fault, it's his.

445
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:41,806
I'll think of how to send you back.
Stop crying. I don't...

446
00:44:41,931 --> 00:44:47,645
Until then, freshen up. Make
yourself at home, okay? Go.

447
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:52,859
He is very magnanimous! He spoke
as if this was his father's house!

448
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:56,196
So what if it isn't my father's?
It does belong to my elder brothers!

449
00:44:58,073 --> 00:45:00,992
O' God! Is he a brother or a butcher?

450
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:04,954
We save every dollar,
and send it home.

451
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,751
I swear by God, if our
hands weren't tied...

452
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:13,505
...we'd have made some
arrangement to send you back.

453
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:22,681
Why are you feeling disheartened?
You have a 6 month visa.

454
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:26,434
God willing, you won't need
to take favours from anyone.

455
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:32,273
You will work hard, and
return to India with your money.

456
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:36,653
Have faith in God.
Everything will be fine.

457
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:41,032
God is in India. How
will He come to America?

458
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:48,123
Don't underestimate America! There
is no dearth of temples and mosques!

459
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:52,711
Yes. Everybody goes to
the temple on Sundays.

460
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:56,256
Even you go tomorrow, on a Sunday.

461
00:45:56,673 --> 00:46:01,886
What nonsense! He had said that
we'd go for a picnic on Sunday!

462
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:08,977
We will go for a picnic too.
But after praying at the temple.

463
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:22,115
Good-day.
- Good-day. How are you?

464
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,537
Fine, with your blessing. They are
new; I brought them to the temple.

465
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:31,916
He is Jaikishan Patel.
- Hello. What's your name?

466
00:46:33,376 --> 00:46:35,462
And yours?
- Pooja.

467
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:39,841
That's a very nice name. May
God bless the couple forever!

468
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:45,472
No, it isn't what you think.

469
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:50,477
Pray that I succeed in my goal.

470
00:46:50,685 --> 00:46:51,936
Yes.

471
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:56,524
Dear God, save me from
every single trouble.

472
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:09,662
Here's $11. It's all I have.
I'll give more once I start to earn.

473
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,085
God gets pleased with the intentions
of the one who gives an offering.

474
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:17,796
Put it in the money box.
- Okay.

475
00:47:19,255 --> 00:47:21,549
My God!
- What happened?

476
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:25,095
Riots have broken out in Surat,
a city in India.

477
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,764
Many innocent people have been killed.

478
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:31,142
What's in my hand?
- An Urdu newspaper.

479
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:35,522
The same news has been published in
this too. In fact, I was reading it!

480
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:39,484
Brother Pakistan, I
can't fathom one thing.

481
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:45,740
When the news published is the same,
why do we buy 4 newspapers?

482
00:47:46,157 --> 00:47:50,120
He's right. The news is the same,
only the languages differ.

483
00:47:50,328 --> 00:47:57,210
All the languages and
religions of the world differ.

484
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:00,547
But their intent is the same.

485
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:05,552
If man can understand this,
then I swear by God...

486
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:08,263
...all of the world's fights would end!

487
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:12,017
Yes. And we will also save dollars!

488
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:15,353
Vaswani, why do you
always talk about money?

489
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:20,567
We are discussing humanity,
brotherhood, oneness.

490
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:24,738
For example, take Rohan and Pooja.
Are we related? No!

491
00:48:25,363 --> 00:48:27,866
But I have kept her
for the sake of humanity.

492
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:33,079
All of you are crazy! In
today's times, one doesn't keep...

493
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:37,459
...a known person, and
you keep a total stranger!

494
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:40,795
He came first. Then,
he brought a girl.

495
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:45,592
I ask, has he mentioned
something about himself or not?

496
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:49,554
Excuse me, friends...

497
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:54,142
I'm here to tell you something

498
00:48:56,436 --> 00:49:03,943
There's something
you must know about me

499
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:37,727
Excuse me, friends, I'm
here to tell you something

500
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:50,865
There's something
you must know about me

501
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:58,164
I'm young, I come from abroad...

502
00:49:58,915 --> 00:50:03,378
I seek to live in your hearts

503
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:19,227
Excuse me, friends, I'm
here to tell you something

504
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:25,692
There's something
you must know about me

505
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:31,591
What do I say about you,
beloved nation?

506
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:38,473
You are quite incomparable

507
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:46,189
The scent of your soil,
I love. I worship you

508
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:55,573
You come from my country. Tell me...

509
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:02,247
How is my beloved country?

510
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:13,508
How is my beloved nation?

511
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:22,684
Do people still sleep in the
shade of the Neem, in their fields?

512
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:32,694
Do children still
play their lovely games?

513
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:42,912
Do grandmothers still tell
tales of the kings and the queens?

514
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:52,714
Do mothers still sing lullabies
to put their children to sleep?

515
00:52:55,633 --> 00:53:01,681
On harvest-day, do people
still dance the Bhangra?

516
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:12,317
Do they still beat the
drums during colourful weddings?

517
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:21,910
Do the eateries there
still serve maize-bread?

518
00:53:25,246 --> 00:53:32,128
Do the plaits of beautiful
girls still fly at the fairs?

519
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:45,684
I bring with me the
scent of your nation's soil

520
00:53:56,111 --> 00:54:01,533
Excuse me, friends, I'm
here to tell you something

521
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:08,206
There's something
you must know about me

522
00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:20,510
O beloved nation, I
could die for you

523
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:34,691
You are my pride, you are my glory

524
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:41,156
You are my life, I could die for you

525
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:47,829
You are my desire,
I'm known because of you

526
00:54:48,246 --> 00:54:54,502
In you, I have faith. For you,
I could sacrifice myself

527
00:54:57,422 --> 00:55:04,095
Do the waves in the
Chenaub still speak of love?

528
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:13,897
Do the gamely winds still
give you the heady feeling?

529
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:24,115
Do people still sing ghazals
authored by Ghalib and Mir?

530
00:55:27,243 --> 00:55:33,708
Do they still hold
their colourful gatherings?

531
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:43,927
Does vermicelli-porridge
still make the Idd fragrant?

532
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:53,728
Do they still have
fairs on every festival?

533
00:55:56,439 --> 00:56:03,530
Do they still sing a
bridal song for the bridegroom?

534
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:13,331
Do they still distribute
sweetmeats to celebrate happiness?

535
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:21,673
Embrace me...

536
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:27,512
I'm very much like you

537
00:56:36,896 --> 00:56:42,944
Excuse me, friends, I'm
here to tell you something

538
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:49,409
There's something
you must know about me

539
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:09,637
I don't like it here,
in this alien land

540
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:41,336
Nothing seems to be for real

541
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:45,715
Love is worth nothing...

542
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:53,223
...there are no
compassionate words to listen to

543
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:01,147
My loved ones, have spurned me...

544
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:07,404
...and strangers have accepted me

545
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:12,617
I've forgotten what my
threshold looked like...

546
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:20,125
...I miss my folks very much

547
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:33,888
I have sympathies for you...

548
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:46,192
...do not treat me like a stranger

549
00:58:55,535 --> 00:59:01,624
Excuse me, my friends, I'm
here to tell you something

550
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:08,089
There's something
you must know about me

551
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:15,180
I'm a young man from abroad.

552
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:20,393
I seek a place in your hearts.

553
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:05,438
What have I done!

554
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:13,780
Officer, I'll explain, I'll explain.

555
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:18,326
Look, I've been driving this cab
since 6 days... - Take it easy!

556
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:20,870
Since 6 days you have
been doing this! - Ya!

557
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,790
Well, that's no good. -
But you can't arrest me!

558
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:25,667
Ya, I'm going to arrest you.

559
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:28,795
This rookie cab driver does
not have legitimate papers...

560
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:31,506
Says, he does not need
them in his country.

561
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,217
Give me the paper work,
I'll charge sheet him.

562
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:40,473
O' God! Who is going to
help me in this alien land?

563
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:07,167
Mr. Jaikishan, you?

564
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:15,925
I'm Jaikishan only in the temple,
when I'm doing social service.

565
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,262
But here, I'm Jack Patel.
Officer Jack Patel.

566
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:31,566
Recognised me? I had got a ritual
done by you in the temple yesterday.

567
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:35,528
I had offered $11 so that God
would save me from troubles.

568
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:39,699
But I fell in a spot today.
- What happened?

569
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:43,453
I was driving a cab
with a fake license.

570
01:01:46,164 --> 01:01:49,709
Well, if you have committed a crime,
you will be punished.

571
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:53,880
I drove a taxi for a living. I
didn't plunder or murder anyone...

572
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:56,591
A crime is a crime, big or petty!

573
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,719
Please try to understand.
I had no job.

574
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,473
I will not repeat this.

575
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:12,649
Fine. I'll try to have
you released on bail.

576
01:02:12,857 --> 01:02:15,151
From where will I...
- No!

577
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,279
You will have to pay a fine
- $200

578
01:02:18,988 --> 01:02:21,491
Sergeant, fine him $200.

579
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:28,498
Who is the owner of the
taxi which you were driving?

580
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:35,797
Police, here?! He's so crazy!
He's brought a cop here!

581
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:40,677
Welcome! Patel, sir.

582
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:45,598
Have something cold... Hey, bring
some cold water for Mr. Patel...

583
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:50,186
Did you give him a taxi?

584
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:57,485
Yes... Fool! Has there been an
accident or have you killed someone?

585
01:02:57,777 --> 01:02:59,571
Shut up!

586
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:06,661
You know he has a fake license. Why
did you let him drive a taxi then?

587
01:03:07,078 --> 01:03:11,666
I helped him because
he was from India.

588
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,586
After all, a brother comes to
the rescue of a fellow-brother!

589
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:17,714
How was I to know that
he had a fake license?!

590
01:03:17,922 --> 01:03:21,051
Sir, you are an Indian, and so am I...

591
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:24,804
Hey, cut this Indian brother nonsense.

592
01:03:26,264 --> 01:03:30,435
Stay within the limits of
the country you reside in.

593
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:36,691
I live in America. It's my duty to
protect the law of this country.

594
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,279
If you repeat this, then
I'll confiscate your license!

595
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:46,284
Your taxis will rot,
and so will you, in jail!

596
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,244
Understand.

597
01:03:50,246 --> 01:03:54,209
The police have seized your taxi.
Pay a fine, and take it back.

598
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,337
And young man.

599
01:03:57,545 --> 01:04:01,091
I hope you will not do
anything illegal now.

600
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,593
Good Luck.

601
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:09,641
I had told you not to flout rules.
Then, why did you break them?

602
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:12,977
I was thinking about mother. I
was just not paying any attention.

603
01:04:14,854 --> 01:04:17,357
I turned my taxi to the
left instead of right.

604
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:21,945
When I think about my mother, I
always drive my car in the centre.

605
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:27,367
What kind of a man are you!
You wait for a chance to joke!

606
01:04:27,575 --> 01:04:30,286
Thank God, the trouble has ended.

607
01:04:30,495 --> 01:04:33,623
No. The trouble has snowballed.
- Meaning?

608
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,377
I'm unemployed now.
- I didn't think of it.

609
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:39,879
First we were worried
about finding a job for her.

610
01:04:40,046 --> 01:04:42,549
Now, we'll have to find
jobs for both of them.

611
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:47,178
Doctor saab, welcome, welcome.

612
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:52,809
How are you, Chaurasia?
- It's been a very long time.

613
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:54,894
Long time, no see.

614
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:58,023
I was passing by, so I
thought I'd buy some sweets.

615
01:04:58,106 --> 01:04:59,691
Sure, my dear Mrs.

616
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:03,445
Pack the doctor's favourite sweets.

617
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:06,156
How are you? Is your
diabetes under control?

618
01:05:06,364 --> 01:05:09,909
How can it be, when I
have a sweet business?

619
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:15,957
Doctor, I needed a
small favour from you.

620
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,668
Yes? - This is Rohan
and Pooja. - Greetings!

621
01:05:19,085 --> 01:05:25,342
You have contacts. If they could
get some job, I'll be very thankful.

622
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:28,053
Greetings, doctor.
- Greetings!

623
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:29,888
Very good boy and girl.

624
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:31,806
Please help them.

625
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:36,186
I'll surely let you know
if there is something.

626
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:40,148
Chaurasia, I'll leave...
Here, take this.

627
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:42,859
I'll reach you till out.

628
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:47,447
Sardarbhai, are they
searching for a job?

629
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:51,409
Yes. Even you have many contacts.

630
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:55,372
See if there's any job available
for them. I'll be indebted to you.

631
01:05:55,872 --> 01:06:00,585
There is a vacancy in the American
fast food joint where I'm working.

632
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:06,424
I can employ them there.
- Hey, why do you even ask?!

633
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,344
Why ask? Tell him that
they'll be there in the morning.

634
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:37,617
Careful!

635
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:11,378
You have the right to remain silent.

636
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:17,217
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

637
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:20,637
Rohan, are you okay?
What madness was this?!

638
01:10:20,845 --> 01:10:23,973
You risked your life for a mere $25!

639
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:30,647
It isn't $25. It's your first
day's earnings. How could he take it!

640
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:46,705
What's the sweet for?
- It was our first day at work.

641
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:50,250
Feed Rohan too.

642
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:56,923
Even you have some.
- I don't eat much sweets.

643
01:10:57,132 --> 01:10:59,843
Hey, eat some. You won't become fat.

644
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,762
And even if you do, you'll look good.

645
01:11:11,521 --> 01:11:14,024
I'm tired. I'll go to sleep.

646
01:11:14,107 --> 01:11:17,152
Good night. - Good, good.
- Good night.

647
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,868
Our home has brightened up
since the time they have come here.

648
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:29,664
Do you know what I think
when I see both of them?

649
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:33,001
That it'd be so nice if
they were brother and sister.

650
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:39,466
Don't you know of any
other relationship?!

651
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:41,551
Which relationship?

652
01:11:41,676 --> 01:11:45,513
An eternal relationship!
Of being a man and wife!

653
01:11:45,722 --> 01:11:48,224
Yes, that's not a bad
relationship either.

654
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,935
Not a bad one?!

655
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:57,400
I pray to God to
instill love in their hearts.

656
01:12:51,621 --> 01:13:02,465
What meeting is this?
What high am I experiencing?

657
01:13:12,058 --> 01:13:16,229
You have already left...

658
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:22,068
...and I still wait for you

659
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:33,329
What meeting is this?
What high am I experiencing?

660
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:47,093
You have already left...

661
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:53,558
...and I still wait for you

662
01:14:49,864 --> 01:14:54,244
I feel shy, I feel scared...

663
01:14:54,661 --> 01:15:00,917
...and I run into your arms
without even realizing it

664
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:19,894
What feeling is this?

665
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:27,402
What's in air that sends us berserk?

666
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:38,455
I feel as if I were part of Spring

667
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:46,796
What meeting is this?
What high am I experiencing?

668
01:16:31,841 --> 01:16:37,263
You are the one I always wanted...

669
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:43,728
...you are my Queen, I'm your King

670
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:02,288
A new couple, a new attire...

671
01:17:02,914 --> 01:17:10,213
...a new bungalow and a new car

672
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:20,432
I have no control over myself.
I'm going crazy

673
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:31,276
What meeting is this?
What high am I experiencing?

674
01:17:41,077 --> 01:17:45,248
You have already left...

675
01:17:45,665 --> 01:17:51,087
...and I still wait for you

676
01:17:51,296 --> 01:18:01,514
What meeting is this?
What high am I experiencing?

677
01:18:01,723 --> 01:18:05,685
You have already left...

678
01:18:06,102 --> 01:18:12,776
...and I still wait for you

679
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:31,544
Hey don't touch me.

680
01:18:32,587 --> 01:18:36,132
What's happening boy?

681
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:39,594
What do we want, some chocolate.
- Some sweets.

682
01:18:42,597 --> 01:18:47,394
Good morning, what
would you'll like to have?

683
01:18:47,602 --> 01:18:51,439
Tea, coffee. Behave yourself.

684
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:54,150
No man, she's mine.

685
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:58,029
Stop, it. Leave my hand!

686
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:04,285
What's happening, guys?

687
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:09,082
What's your problem? - Take it easy.

688
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:11,167
What's your problem? -
Don't do anything stupid!

689
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:14,087
You want to hit me? What's that?

690
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:20,760
You son of a bitch!

691
01:19:25,348 --> 01:19:27,642
Come here, man! Come here!

692
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:33,481
Rohan!

693
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,373
Back again?

694
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:03,303
Come on, you piece of shit! - Come on!

695
01:20:14,981 --> 01:20:18,943
What have you done, Rohan?
Suppose the owner hears of it, then?

696
01:20:24,574 --> 01:20:27,494
Don't annoy me! As it is, I'm angry!

697
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:30,205
We had got a job with difficulty,
and now, we don't even have that!

698
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:35,627
So what? We'll get another.
- Why did you have to thrash them?

699
01:20:36,044 --> 01:20:38,755
Should I merely watch
if someone teases you?!

700
01:20:39,172 --> 01:20:43,343
You know how dangerous these
people are. Suppose he had a revolver?

701
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:45,011
I wouldn't have spared him even then!

702
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,931
I can't tolerate
anyone misbehaving with you!

703
01:20:48,556 --> 01:20:52,310
Why?
- I can't tolerate it! Period!

704
01:20:56,398 --> 01:21:00,860
Can you see that vacancy board?
They need a man, not a girl.

705
01:21:01,277 --> 01:21:03,780
Go home. I'll come later.

706
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:10,245
But Rohan shouldn't
have indulged in a melee.

707
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:17,127
You're right. Rohan should
have killed that man instead!

708
01:21:17,335 --> 01:21:21,297
What nonsense! It could've been a
police case; this is a foreign land.

709
01:21:21,506 --> 01:21:26,720
So what?! If someone misbehaves
with a girl, should he be spared?!

710
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:29,639
That man should have been killed!

711
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:35,478
Why are you feeling sad?
You will find another job.

712
01:21:37,355 --> 01:21:41,735
I had sent a ' rakhi' to brother,
but he has sent it back.

713
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:49,659
Why did you send him one?! He
does not deserve it! Forget him!

714
01:21:50,076 --> 01:21:53,830
Aren't we your brothers?
Tie me a ' rakhi'.

715
01:21:53,955 --> 01:21:55,707
Me too!

716
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:19,898
You were crying for one brother,
but God gave you two instead!

717
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,988
We'll employ you in a place
where there are good people.

718
01:22:27,405 --> 01:22:31,159
Employ Rohan first.
He's also unemployed.

719
01:22:31,785 --> 01:22:35,330
I have found a job, Sardarbhai.
- At the same place?

720
01:22:35,538 --> 01:22:37,832
Yes.
- Where?

721
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,292
In a petrol pump.

722
01:22:52,722 --> 01:22:55,558
Light?
- There's no smoking.

723
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:58,061
Why? - It's a gas station!

724
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,815
Fill her up!

725
01:23:12,742 --> 01:23:17,247
I'm off, man. - Ya, right.
- See you later.

726
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:26,006
Hey! You here?
- It had started to rain.

727
01:23:26,423 --> 01:23:29,968
I thought you'd get drenched,
so I came to take you.

728
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,262
That's good.
- Let's go?

729
01:23:42,063 --> 01:23:44,983
Neither can you escape
these showers nor can I.

730
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:48,319
What do we do then?

731
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:55,201
What are you doing?

732
01:23:55,326 --> 01:23:59,164
Let me see how it feels getting
drenched in the rains of America!

733
01:23:59,289 --> 01:24:02,917
Come under the umbrella.
- A tiger needs no umbrella!

734
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:05,628
He roams freely in the rains,
just like this!

735
01:24:05,754 --> 01:24:10,425
Can't you understand what I'm saying!
Stand quietly and don't move!

736
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:52,133
Fool! Will you build a house
with an umbrella in a petrol pump?!

737
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:56,096
Quickly sit behind. Hurry!

738
01:24:56,304 --> 01:24:57,764
Sit.

739
01:24:57,972 --> 01:25:01,518
I will certainly take the taxi fare.

740
01:25:01,935 --> 01:25:04,437
Really? I'll pay the bus fare!

741
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:06,940
Dollar is dollar.

742
01:25:14,864 --> 01:25:18,827
A person says, bless you,
when somebody sneezes.

743
01:25:19,035 --> 01:25:22,997
But how often have I explained to
you to wear a raincoat in the rains?

744
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:27,794
Here's hot ' bhajia',
Rohan, drink this syrup first.

745
01:25:28,211 --> 01:25:33,633
Whenever my dear mister catches
a cold, I give him this syrup.

746
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:37,387
I never knew that
even tigers catch cold!

747
01:25:37,595 --> 01:25:40,098
Please don't annoy me!
I'm already very worked up!

748
01:25:40,306 --> 01:25:42,809
What is the problem?

749
01:25:43,643 --> 01:25:46,771
I can't fathom a thing! Is
this what I've come to do here?!

750
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:50,316
To wash utensils, wash cars,
drive a taxi?!

751
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:53,028
I could have done this even in India!

752
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:57,407
My visa expires after 4 months,
and I'll have to return!

753
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:01,786
I just can't fathom how
to become an affluent man!

754
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:06,374
First of all, don't be disheartened.

755
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:10,545
Secondly, to become an
affluent man in America...

756
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:15,342
...the first step is to
become a Green Card holder.

757
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:17,844
Meaning?

758
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:21,598
The Indians residing
here permanently...

759
01:26:21,723 --> 01:26:27,645
...and possessing American
citizenship, are called as NRIs.

760
01:26:27,854 --> 01:26:30,357
Understand?
- So?

761
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:34,944
Like me, you also have a
very good personality.

762
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:43,495
So take advantage of it, woo
an NRI girl, and marry her!

763
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:47,665
Once you marry her,
you'll get a Green Card.

764
01:26:47,874 --> 01:26:50,585
And you'll become a
permanent resident of America.

765
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:54,547
Is it good to use an NRI
girl to make progress?!

766
01:26:54,756 --> 01:27:01,846
What's wrong? He will
marry sooner or later.

767
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:04,140
Won't you?
- Of course.

768
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:07,268
If you will, then what's
wrong with an NRI girl?

769
01:27:08,311 --> 01:27:12,482
Chaurasiabhai, what a
fantastic idea! You've made my life!

770
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:20,407
But where will I find my progress, I
mean, this NRI girl? - Good question!

771
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:26,246
The answer to your question is
present on the poster stuck here.

772
01:27:26,746 --> 01:27:29,249
'Grand Navratri Festival'.

773
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:34,587
Beautiful Indian girls
come in groups to attend this.

774
01:27:36,256 --> 01:27:42,095
And knowing you, It won't be difficult
to woo one girl in that group!

775
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,185
Here's $12.50. Get me a ticket.

776
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:53,773
You have to go as a
couple there, with a girl.

777
01:27:53,982 --> 01:27:55,442
A girl?

778
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:59,195
She'll come!
- I won't! Why should I?

779
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:01,281
What!

780
01:28:01,906 --> 01:28:07,537
I helped you so much. I
brought you here, got you a job.

781
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:12,542
And you can't do this much for me?
Pooja, it's the question of my life!

782
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,462
If I strike it big, then
I'll come of use to you, right?

783
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:18,173
I don't have money to
waste on the ticket!

784
01:28:18,798 --> 01:28:22,344
I'll buy it for you.
- I don't have nice clothes either!

785
01:28:22,969 --> 01:28:25,472
Hey, I'll buy you that also!

786
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:31,311
If I have to strike it big, I'll
have to make some investments, right?

787
01:29:06,137 --> 01:29:09,265
Okay! So, you've come with Jatin?

788
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:10,600
He's a cool guy.

789
01:29:10,725 --> 01:29:13,228
Loveleen, whom have you come with?

790
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:20,527
I have come with one man,
but will leave with another.

791
01:29:20,735 --> 01:29:22,195
You are the limit!

792
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:24,489
Aren't you ever content with one?

793
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:32,122
Your dress is lovely. Can
you wear it all your life?

794
01:29:32,205 --> 01:29:36,376
You can't, right? You
should keep changing.

795
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:15,165
Ever since I've seen her,
I've been restless.

796
01:30:15,373 --> 01:30:20,170
Ever since I've seen her,
I've been restless.

797
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:25,175
I can't wait anymore, my love.

798
01:30:26,426 --> 01:30:28,928
This is love...

799
01:30:29,137 --> 01:30:35,810
...this is love.

800
01:30:36,853 --> 01:30:39,356
Oh yes, this is love...

801
01:30:39,564 --> 01:30:48,448
...this is love indeed.

802
01:30:48,531 --> 01:30:53,536
The moment I saw you,
I lose my peace...

803
01:30:53,953 --> 01:31:01,670
...how I wish I could
keep looking at you

804
01:31:03,963 --> 01:31:06,466
This is love...

805
01:31:06,675 --> 01:31:13,139
...this is love.

806
01:31:14,557 --> 01:31:16,476
This is love, indeed...

807
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:24,401
...yes, this is love.

808
01:31:58,393 --> 01:32:07,152
You seem to be faltering in
your step, beautiful one.

809
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:23,209
Do not cast a spell
on this crazy chap.

810
01:32:29,883 --> 01:32:34,679
Hearts coming together in love...

811
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:39,893
...do not stand between us.

812
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:45,940
It's the effect of
my dazzling beauty...

813
01:32:46,358 --> 01:32:50,945
...the one who happens to
see me, could die for me.

814
01:32:56,368 --> 01:33:05,752
Indeed, this is love.

815
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:16,596
This is love for sure.

816
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:48,294
The tan on my skin...

817
01:33:48,461 --> 01:33:55,802
...would put the
best of them to shame.

818
01:34:01,641 --> 01:34:12,694
Every man seeks me for a lifetime.

819
01:34:16,448 --> 01:34:22,078
At first sight, you drove me crazy...

820
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:27,292
...you have robbed me
of my sleep and peace.

821
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:32,922
Believe me, my love...

822
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:38,345
...she's one of those passing
fancies, do not pin your hopes on her.

823
01:34:43,558 --> 01:34:52,942
This is love...

824
01:34:54,235 --> 01:34:58,573
...this is love for sure.

825
01:34:59,407 --> 01:35:03,995
Indeed, this is love.

826
01:35:04,829 --> 01:35:09,626
Ever since I've seen her,
I've been restless.

827
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:14,422
I can't wait anymore, my love.

828
01:35:15,465 --> 01:35:19,636
This is love...

829
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:25,058
...this is love.

830
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:30,480
Oh yes, this is love...

831
01:35:31,314 --> 01:35:35,902
...this is love indeed.

832
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:55,505
Love...

833
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:03,698
You are so lucky for me!
- Leave me!

834
01:37:03,865 --> 01:37:08,703
Hey, why are you angry? You should
be happy that my life will be made!

835
01:37:09,329 --> 01:37:12,457
And why were you barging
in the middle every time?!

836
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:15,585
Suppose, it had ruined matters, then?

837
01:37:17,253 --> 01:37:22,467
Hey! The matter did click!
I did get her number!

838
01:37:23,093 --> 01:37:27,055
I have to now think what to
talk to her over the phone.

839
01:37:33,561 --> 01:37:38,566
What's the matter? You
look very worked up.

840
01:37:39,192 --> 01:37:42,737
I don't know what to say to her.
- Then don't talk to her!

841
01:37:43,154 --> 01:37:45,657
Does one need to think to talk?!

842
01:37:46,282 --> 01:37:50,245
I don't think before speaking to
you but it's her I've got to talk to!

843
01:37:50,453 --> 01:37:53,581
And in such a way that she'll go
crazy about me over the phone!

844
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:59,212
Then tell her, you want to make
money, so you want to marry her and...

845
01:37:59,295 --> 01:38:03,591
Hey! Do you want to make
matters work or ruin them?

846
01:38:04,009 --> 01:38:06,720
If you can't help me, then don't!

847
01:38:06,803 --> 01:38:08,179
Don't disturb me.

848
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:15,895
Look at the state the gentleman
is in! Sleep has become evasive!

849
01:38:16,521 --> 01:38:23,820
It feels like, her beautiful face is
all you can see everywhere you look!

850
01:38:24,863 --> 01:38:31,119
And you will be at peace,
only when you meet her!

851
01:38:31,327 --> 01:38:35,498
What are you saying! You
have solved my problem!

852
01:38:36,124 --> 01:38:41,129
A friend in need is a friend indeed!
This is what I'll say!

853
01:38:43,214 --> 01:38:45,717
This is what I'll say!

854
01:38:59,272 --> 01:39:01,775
Hi! This is Rohan speaking.
Did you recognise me?

855
01:39:03,234 --> 01:39:08,448
We met at night. You had written
your number with lipstick & given me.

856
01:39:09,699 --> 01:39:11,159
Remember? - Of course, hi!

857
01:39:16,164 --> 01:39:18,667
I didn't disturb you, did I?

858
01:39:21,586 --> 01:39:23,672
Where are you calling from?

859
01:39:25,965 --> 01:39:28,468
From the car. I'm
speaking from my mobile phone.

860
01:39:28,885 --> 01:39:33,473
I think you were asleep, but
for me, sleep has become evasive!

861
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,312
Since the time I've seen you,
you are all I think of!

862
01:39:39,604 --> 01:39:43,066
It seems like your beautiful face
is all I can see, everywhere I look!

863
01:39:43,483 --> 01:39:52,867
This restless heart will be at peace,
only when you meet me!

864
01:39:53,702 --> 01:39:59,541
Well, even I want to meet you,
but that will be difficult today.

865
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:02,335
I am busy today.

866
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:05,588
I'm going to Trump Taj
Casino with somebody.

867
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:12,345
Sorry. - Trump Taj!
What a coincidence!

868
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:14,973
Incidentally, even I
will be going there today!

869
01:40:15,598 --> 01:40:18,101
At least, we'll meet there, huh?

870
01:40:19,352 --> 01:40:21,021
That's great!

871
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:24,274
I look forward to seeing you.

872
01:40:48,548 --> 01:40:52,093
Karan, how much more
will you play? I'm bored!

873
01:40:52,302 --> 01:40:54,804
Just for some more time.

874
01:41:02,187 --> 01:41:05,440
Loveleen, wait for me at the
restaurant. I'll be there in a jiffy.

875
01:41:08,068 --> 01:41:09,819
Alright!

876
01:41:19,204 --> 01:41:21,706
You have to go to Miami.

877
01:41:21,915 --> 01:41:25,460
No, Vikram, please!
Don't make me do this.

878
01:41:26,294 --> 01:41:28,797
This is Marco's decision, not mine.

879
01:41:29,422 --> 01:41:33,385
And you know very well
how dangerous he is.

880
01:41:34,844 --> 01:41:42,143
If Marco learns that you have
refused, then he can do anything.

881
01:41:42,227 --> 01:41:48,191
No! I haven't refused, I'm only
requesting you not make me do this.

882
01:41:48,608 --> 01:41:51,319
Don't send me anywhere with drugs.

883
01:41:51,945 --> 01:41:54,864
If I get caught, you
know what can happen.

884
01:41:56,324 --> 01:42:02,580
Karan, you have taken $150,000 from Marco for your vices!

885
01:42:03,832 --> 01:42:07,168
Neither are you repaying the
money nor paying the interest.

886
01:42:10,088 --> 01:42:16,344
So, keep doing our job
till you repay Marco's money.

887
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,607
Hi! My name is Rohan.

888
01:42:30,525 --> 01:42:32,694
Oh, hello! I'm Lovleen.

889
01:42:34,696 --> 01:42:38,950
Lovleen! What a lovely name,
Lovleen. - Thank you.

890
01:42:39,034 --> 01:42:41,369
Your family has given
you a very apt name!

891
01:42:42,203 --> 01:42:45,123
Anyone who meets you,
will begin to love you!

892
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,379
May I take a seat? - Sure.

893
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:57,635
It's a strange coincidence.

894
01:42:57,844 --> 01:43:01,598
We didn't know one
another or each other's names.

895
01:43:03,058 --> 01:43:08,063
But now I feel that we
know each other very well.

896
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,565
You dance well.

897
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:11,858
Would you like a drink?

898
01:43:12,025 --> 01:43:14,736
Will you have something to drink?
- Coke is fine. - Yes, sir.

899
01:43:16,821 --> 01:43:19,532
Are you from here or India?

900
01:43:19,741 --> 01:43:24,746
From India. But I'm
thinking of settling down here.

901
01:43:25,163 --> 01:43:29,334
Why? Don't you like India?
- No. That's not the case.

902
01:43:29,542 --> 01:43:33,713
But you see, I want to expand...

903
01:43:33,922 --> 01:43:35,215
...expand my business.

904
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:38,718
I have property worth
millions in India. - Really?

905
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:42,889
Yes. I am a very big
landlord there. - Alright!

906
01:43:43,723 --> 01:43:46,851
What are you doing? Didn't
you go driving your taxi today?

907
01:43:49,562 --> 01:43:52,065
What nonsense! Who are you!

908
01:43:53,316 --> 01:43:58,321
Amazing! Don't you
recognise me? I see! A girl...

909
01:43:59,447 --> 01:44:02,409
Impression! He's a very good driver.

910
01:44:02,492 --> 01:44:06,454
He drives very well! Sometimes, he
leaves both his hands, and drives!

911
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:11,042
Work matters to your advantage.
We'll meet later. Woo her!

912
01:44:13,336 --> 01:44:16,673
I wonder who that
impertinent man was! What was I saying?

913
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:19,384
Landlord.

914
01:44:19,467 --> 01:44:22,095
We've been landlords since very long.

915
01:44:23,138 --> 01:44:26,474
The government has confiscated
more than half the property.

916
01:44:27,934 --> 01:44:31,688
Yet, there's a lot. I'm not even
aware of how much property I have.

917
01:44:37,318 --> 01:44:39,404
What kind of a man are you!

918
01:44:39,487 --> 01:44:41,489
Your job first thing
in the morning is...

919
01:44:41,573 --> 01:44:45,243
...to wash utensils,
clothes, clean the kitchen...

920
01:44:45,326 --> 01:44:47,787
...but you've left all
the chores unattended!

921
01:44:47,954 --> 01:44:50,874
What nonsense you speak!
- Am I speaking nonsense?

922
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:54,002
I think you are not too well.

923
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:58,381
I'll make you all right.
Come home soon, okay?

924
01:45:01,509 --> 01:45:06,306
I think I look like somebody he knows!

925
01:45:09,434 --> 01:45:14,647
Maybe. But I think
you look quite similar.

926
01:45:23,823 --> 01:45:29,871
You're here! I went to the petrol
pump thinking you'd be washing cars!

927
01:45:32,791 --> 01:45:35,293
What's this nonsense!

928
01:45:36,127 --> 01:45:40,924
Oh, I understood! You are being
discreet as you are sitting with her!

929
01:45:43,635 --> 01:45:46,137
We'll meet later. No problem. Bye.

930
01:45:54,479 --> 01:45:59,901
Please don't misunderstand me.

931
01:46:00,735 --> 01:46:04,072
I understand you perfectly.

932
01:46:05,115 --> 01:46:08,243
Now, I'll speak, and you'll listen.

933
01:46:09,911 --> 01:46:15,750
I'm not an illiterate
bumpkin but a modern girl of today.

934
01:46:17,002 --> 01:46:22,841
Don't try to impress me
by pretending to be rich.

935
01:46:23,675 --> 01:46:30,348
Because my father has made
so much wealth in my name...

936
01:46:32,642 --> 01:46:34,519
...that you can't even imagine!

937
01:46:38,064 --> 01:46:41,192
I am indeed very
pleased to meet you now.

938
01:46:43,278 --> 01:46:46,406
I'm really ashamed for...
- Loveleen, let's go.

939
01:46:47,032 --> 01:46:50,160
Karan, this is Rohan. Rohan, Karan!

940
01:46:50,368 --> 01:46:52,245
You... - Oh, please!

941
01:46:52,871 --> 01:46:55,999
Now, don't say that
you've also seen him before!

942
01:46:56,624 --> 01:47:01,421
I am sure I have!
- I'll go crazy!

943
01:47:03,506 --> 01:47:08,511
All of us will be meeting at
Seaside Heights beach. Join us.

944
01:47:19,147 --> 01:47:23,318
I won't be able to come with you
tomorrow. I've to go out for 2 days.

945
01:47:23,526 --> 01:47:26,446
Where?
- I have some work in Miami.

946
01:47:27,072 --> 01:47:29,574
Come, I'll reach you home.

947
01:47:30,492 --> 01:47:33,536
Here's a couplet.
- Go on!

948
01:47:33,745 --> 01:47:39,584
'Stay with us, and every
joy of life you will savour'

949
01:47:39,793 --> 01:47:41,878
That's a bad couplet!

950
01:47:42,087 --> 01:47:46,049
You let all my efforts go down the
drain, and above that, you laugh!

951
01:47:46,883 --> 01:47:51,680
Sardarbhai, put less chilly.
Rohan finds it quite spicy!

952
01:47:51,888 --> 01:47:55,642
Mock at me! Anyway
50% of my work is done!

953
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:59,187
And if you hadn't interferred,
then it would have been done 100%.

954
01:47:59,604 --> 01:48:02,941
I'd have married her, got a Green
Card, and then my life would be made!

955
01:48:03,358 --> 01:48:08,571
How were we to know your plan? If we
knew, we wouldn't have come there.

956
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:14,202
Pooja was feeling bored at home.
And even I didn't feel like working.

957
01:48:14,285 --> 01:48:16,705
So I told her that
we'd go out somewhere.

958
01:48:16,788 --> 01:48:19,624
And by coincidence, we
reached the same place.

959
01:48:20,166 --> 01:48:22,961
Listen to me carefully now. I
am informing you beforehand.

960
01:48:23,378 --> 01:48:27,340
I will be going with Loveleen
tomorrow to Seaside Heights beach.

961
01:48:27,966 --> 01:48:32,554
Don't even be seen anywhere
near that place, understand?!

962
01:48:38,393 --> 01:48:42,355
Don't heed the nonsense he speaks.
Listen to what I say now.

963
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:47,152
Certainly go there tomorrow, dressed
in the same fashion as Loveleen.

964
01:48:47,777 --> 01:48:52,365
And tell Rohan in front
of her that you love him.

965
01:50:03,895 --> 01:50:10,151
I've lost my heart to you.
You are the one I love

966
01:50:23,289 --> 01:50:28,920
I'll say it to the whole world...

967
01:50:35,802 --> 01:50:39,973
...you're the one I'm in love with

968
01:50:40,807 --> 01:50:46,438
I've lost my heart to you.
You are the one I love

969
01:51:43,161 --> 01:51:48,166
You are Ionely. I am Ionely...

970
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,422
...I'm terrified of Ioneliness

971
01:51:55,256 --> 01:52:00,261
Why must you be scared?
Tell her, my love...

972
01:52:01,096 --> 01:52:06,309
...how crazy you are about my beauty

973
01:52:08,603 --> 01:52:13,817
I'm in a daze; I'm
not in my senses...

974
01:52:14,025 --> 01:52:19,864
...you're responsible for my state,
I alone haven't done it

975
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:30,709
All day and night,
I now wait for you

976
01:52:31,126 --> 01:52:37,590
I've lost my heart to you.
You are the one I love

977
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:51,414
I'm a virgin. So are you...

978
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:57,879
...for how long are we
going to remain like this?

979
01:53:58,505 --> 01:54:03,927
How hopes are dashed, in
a heart full of desires...

980
01:54:04,135 --> 01:54:09,349
...think of it for a moment

981
01:54:11,017 --> 01:54:16,856
Your glance has
pierced my heart, my love

982
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:23,113
I pine so much, I
find life unbearable

983
01:54:23,738 --> 01:54:28,952
Let me kiss your lips.

984
01:54:29,577 --> 01:54:33,957
I'm not scared of anyone

985
01:54:34,457 --> 01:54:40,213
I've lost my heart to you.
You are the one I love

986
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:56,271
I'll say it to the whole world...

987
01:55:02,527 --> 01:55:07,115
...you're the one I'm in love with

988
01:55:07,741 --> 01:55:13,580
I've lost my heart to you.
You are the one I love

989
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:27,969
Don't you even know
how to speak to a girl?!

990
01:55:28,053 --> 01:55:33,600
Do you know how much she loves you?!
- I learnt of it just today!

991
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:40,065
Don't pin your hopes on me! My
objective is absolutely clear!

992
01:55:40,899 --> 01:55:44,027
I want to marry Loveleen,
and settle here!

993
01:55:44,652 --> 01:55:47,572
Whereas you have to arrange for
your ticket, and return to India!

994
01:55:48,406 --> 01:55:53,411
Our paths are different, and
don't try to tread on mine!

995
01:55:53,828 --> 01:55:57,999
Does money mean everything to you?
Doesn't love hold any value?!

996
01:55:58,416 --> 01:56:00,919
Did I ask her to
fall in love with me?!

997
01:56:01,127 --> 01:56:04,881
And why shouldn't I make money? I
have come from India to do just that!

998
01:56:05,090 --> 01:56:09,052
Why did you come here?
To make money, right?!

999
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:13,431
But we didn't put our
conscience at stake to earn money!

1000
01:56:15,308 --> 01:56:18,853
So, did you come thinking that
you'd drive a taxi all your life?!

1001
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:25,527
It's useless to talk to you now,
as you are blinded by selfishness!

1002
01:56:26,361 --> 01:56:33,660
But the day your eyes open, you
will deeply regret, and return to her!

1003
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:38,873
I want to move ahead
in life, not come back!

1004
01:56:40,333 --> 01:56:43,044
And you are jealous of my progress!

1005
01:56:44,713 --> 01:56:48,675
You've been driving a taxi for 10
years! You couldn't become anything!

1006
01:56:49,718 --> 01:56:53,263
But your heart burns because
I am going to strike it big!

1007
01:57:04,858 --> 01:57:10,155
Did you see that? I had
told you not to keep him here.

1008
01:57:12,032 --> 01:57:14,534
Is this why we kept him?

1009
01:57:16,411 --> 01:57:18,913
I made a mistake, lqbal.

1010
01:57:21,207 --> 01:57:26,421
I failed to recognise this person.

1011
01:57:30,175 --> 01:57:33,511
What had you said the other day?

1012
01:57:35,388 --> 01:57:37,891
That you have come to
live in our hearts?!

1013
01:57:38,516 --> 01:57:43,521
You hadn't come to do that, but to
mock at our hearts, and break it!

1014
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:49,986
I feel angry at myself, not on you...

1015
01:57:50,195 --> 01:57:53,948
...wondering how I could have let a
person like you live in my house!

1016
01:57:54,574 --> 01:57:57,702
You have done me no
favour; I'll pay the rent!

1017
01:58:27,941 --> 01:58:32,112
Pooja dear, I am the actual culprit.

1018
01:58:33,988 --> 01:58:40,036
I led Rohan to the path on
which he is treading today.

1019
01:58:41,996 --> 01:58:44,416
I'm sorry, dear.

1020
01:58:44,833 --> 01:58:47,335
I cannot bring back Rohan for you.

1021
01:58:47,752 --> 01:58:53,174
But I can surely do something
which will help you forget him...

1022
01:58:54,009 --> 01:58:56,511
...and which will help you be busy.

1023
01:58:57,762 --> 01:59:03,184
I have spoken to Dr.
Khurana, and finalised her job.

1024
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:07,981
Where? - You must have
heard about Mr. Balraj.

1025
01:59:08,606 --> 01:59:14,029
He isn't keeping well these days;
he needs somebody to look after him.

1026
01:59:14,529 --> 01:59:17,157
Mr. Balraj is a very
nice and decent man.

1027
01:59:17,365 --> 01:59:22,162
He is the most respected
and richest Indian here.

1028
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:25,081
I think this would be a good place.

1029
01:59:26,958 --> 01:59:32,380
Lqbal is right. Take up the job,
in the name of the Lord.

1030
01:59:33,631 --> 01:59:36,551
I'll take you to Dr. Khurana today.

1031
01:59:38,219 --> 01:59:42,807
Good afternoon,
doctor. - Good afternoon.

1032
01:59:42,932 --> 01:59:44,893
How are you, Inder?
- Fine.

1033
01:59:45,101 --> 01:59:47,604
Where is Balraj?
- In the bedroom, sir.

1034
01:59:48,438 --> 01:59:53,234
Pooja, he is Inder, the butler.
And, Inder, she is Ms. Pooja.

1035
01:59:53,318 --> 01:59:54,694
Hello, madam.

1036
01:59:54,778 --> 01:59:57,822
She will stay here from today.
I'll introduce her to Balraj.

1037
01:59:58,031 --> 02:00:01,576
Then show her the house,
and her bedroom. - Okay, sir.

1038
02:00:04,287 --> 02:00:07,832
Hi, Beverly! - Good afternoon,
doctor. - Good afternoon.

1039
02:00:08,041 --> 02:00:09,918
It's a beautiful house.

1040
02:00:10,126 --> 02:00:13,672
Yes. Balraj has put in a lot
of hard work and built it.

1041
02:00:14,297 --> 02:00:19,094
Actually, Balraj has no ailment.
His major problem is his Ioneliness.

1042
02:00:19,302 --> 02:00:23,264
He has no daughter. Now that you're
here, you'll understand everything.

1043
02:00:23,682 --> 02:00:25,350
Come.

1044
02:00:44,953 --> 02:00:46,621
Nonsensical news!

1045
02:00:47,455 --> 02:00:51,835
A deranged patient is
absconding from a mental asylum.

1046
02:00:52,877 --> 02:00:55,797
Mentally ill
patients hoping for pension.

1047
02:00:56,423 --> 02:01:00,593
They seek treatment from
able doctors in America...

1048
02:01:01,636 --> 02:01:03,722
Why are you staring at me?

1049
02:01:03,805 --> 02:01:08,309
I don't like you opening your
hair every Sunday, and combing it!

1050
02:01:08,935 --> 02:01:12,063
I dry my hair. Why do
you have any objection?

1051
02:01:12,272 --> 02:01:15,400
Looking at your hair, I
remember my wife Rukhsana.

1052
02:01:15,608 --> 02:01:19,154
I see! I dry my hair only on Sundays!

1053
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:22,907
But you wear a 'salwar' daily!
Doesn't that remind me of my wife?!

1054
02:01:23,033 --> 02:01:25,535
Should I roam naked then?
- It's your wish!

1055
02:01:26,036 --> 02:01:28,538
Stop ringing the bell and talk to me!

1056
02:01:28,621 --> 02:01:31,666
The bell is ringing over there.
Clean your ears!

1057
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,088
Who's it?!

1058
02:01:40,008 --> 02:01:43,136
I've come from the store. Do
lqbal and Sardar live here?

1059
02:01:43,553 --> 02:01:45,430
Yes.
- I see.

1060
02:01:45,638 --> 02:01:50,226
Here's your liquor bottle, and
here's your cigarette carton.

1061
02:01:50,435 --> 02:01:54,397
You give cigarettes to a Sikh?!
- And liquor to a Pathan, you rascal!

1062
02:01:54,689 --> 02:01:56,274
It's not my fault.

1063
02:01:56,358 --> 02:01:59,402
I was asked to give cigarettes
to lqbal, and liquor to Sardar.

1064
02:01:59,819 --> 02:02:02,322
Fool! I am Sardar!

1065
02:02:02,739 --> 02:02:05,450
He is a 'Sardar'(Sikh),
so you must be lqbal.

1066
02:02:05,867 --> 02:02:10,455
Who are you to change our names?!
- You are scolding me for no reason.

1067
02:02:10,872 --> 02:02:12,749
Are we crazy?!

1068
02:02:12,957 --> 02:02:16,294
You are indulging in a duel!
Please forgive me!

1069
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:19,005
Whom are you seeking forgiveness
from? Are we some holy sages?!

1070
02:02:19,339 --> 02:02:21,925
I'll leave.
- No. Come in...

1071
02:02:22,133 --> 02:02:25,470
Make yourself at home!
- Hey! Where are you going?!

1072
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:32,560
What's this? A dance?!
Bloody fool gets me cigarettes!

1073
02:02:34,854 --> 02:02:38,817
You ask for cigarettes on the sly!
- Well, you ask for liquor!

1074
02:02:39,025 --> 02:02:43,196
So why are you accusing me?!
You're the one with evil intentions!

1075
02:02:45,281 --> 02:02:50,495
Hey, what's wrong with us? Why
have we become so irritable?

1076
02:02:55,291 --> 02:02:57,794
What do I say?

1077
02:02:58,211 --> 02:03:05,301
Since the time they have left, we
can't think; we have become edgy.

1078
02:03:06,761 --> 02:03:15,311
Lqbal, I have made up mind now
never to help anybody in life!

1079
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:21,985
And if I do help, then
I won't bring him home.

1080
02:03:25,113 --> 02:03:27,615
If I do bring him home...

1081
02:03:27,824 --> 02:03:34,289
...I swear by God, I won't let
him reside in my heart! Never!!

1082
02:03:38,043 --> 02:03:41,379
If you've had your breakfast,
then take your medicines...

1083
02:03:43,757 --> 02:03:46,259
You were asked not to smoke, right?

1084
02:03:46,801 --> 02:03:49,304
I've been smoking since 20 years,
so I can't quit so easily.

1085
02:03:49,637 --> 02:03:53,475
That's why you have fallen ill.
Come on, extinguish the cigarette.

1086
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:58,063
I can't quit everything. You
asked me to stop drinking, I obliged.

1087
02:03:58,271 --> 02:04:00,565
Now, you ask me to
quit smoking! No way!

1088
02:04:00,774 --> 02:04:05,153
Then, hire someone else to
look after you. I'm going!

1089
02:04:05,236 --> 02:04:11,409
Hey, listen! Here it goes!

1090
02:04:13,078 --> 02:04:17,665
That was your last cigarette.
You will never smoke again, okay?

1091
02:04:21,628 --> 02:04:24,756
If there was anyone in this
house to tell me all this...

1092
02:04:26,424 --> 02:04:28,927
...I wouldn't even have
developed these habits, dear daughter.

1093
02:04:29,135 --> 02:04:32,681
You've called me a daughter,
so you will heed me.

1094
02:04:33,515 --> 02:04:37,268
Have your medicines,
and then drink milk.

1095
02:04:37,894 --> 02:04:40,397
I'll go, I have a lot of work to do.

1096
02:04:58,957 --> 02:05:01,251
What are you looking at?

1097
02:05:01,459 --> 02:05:04,379
Whose room is this?
- My son's.

1098
02:05:04,713 --> 02:05:07,716
Son?
- He comes here sometimes...

1099
02:05:07,799 --> 02:05:09,384
...and sometimes, he doesn't.

1100
02:05:09,592 --> 02:05:13,972
He does as he pleases. I believe
he has even bought a flat somewhere.

1101
02:05:14,597 --> 02:05:17,100
Don't you tell him anything?

1102
02:05:18,768 --> 02:05:22,939
When there was time to tell,
I never said a word.

1103
02:05:25,233 --> 02:05:27,736
It's too late now.

1104
02:05:28,361 --> 02:05:30,864
I don't quite understand.

1105
02:05:32,115 --> 02:05:37,328
When he was 2 years old,
his mother, I mean, my wife...

1106
02:05:40,874 --> 02:05:47,756
...left us. She remarried.

1107
02:05:49,966 --> 02:05:52,761
I was only obsessed with making money.

1108
02:05:54,429 --> 02:05:56,931
He was raised by servants.

1109
02:05:58,183 --> 02:06:02,771
He is not to be entirely blamed for
getting spoilt. Even I am at fault.

1110
02:06:04,230 --> 02:06:07,359
I gave him as much
money as he demanded.

1111
02:06:08,818 --> 02:06:16,117
But I didn't realise that money
would distance me from my son.

1112
02:06:16,743 --> 02:06:22,791
And when I did realise,
he had gone very far away.

1113
02:06:34,052 --> 02:06:42,811
Yes. Once a person goes far away,
it's very difficult for him to return.

1114
02:08:07,604 --> 02:08:11,441
Love is all about having fun...

1115
02:08:12,692 --> 02:08:17,906
...making merry, what
else is it all about?

1116
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:27,082
Have fun, while you live

1117
02:08:33,546 --> 02:08:38,760
Come to me, my love

1118
02:08:40,220 --> 02:08:43,973
You and I meet, so our hearts...

1119
02:08:44,808 --> 02:08:49,187
...so come to me, my love

1120
02:08:51,272 --> 02:08:53,775
Love is all about having fun...

1121
02:08:53,900 --> 02:08:56,069
...making merry, what
else is it all about?

1122
02:08:56,277 --> 02:09:01,700
Have fun, while you live

1123
02:09:06,287 --> 02:09:11,710
Come to me, my love

1124
02:09:12,752 --> 02:09:16,506
You and I meet, so our hearts...

1125
02:09:17,132 --> 02:09:22,554
...so come to me, my love

1126
02:09:25,682 --> 02:09:28,184
It's love

1127
02:10:11,978 --> 02:10:14,689
It's love

1128
02:10:20,779 --> 02:10:25,533
In America...

1129
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:31,373
...they sure are beautiful girls

1130
02:10:33,667 --> 02:10:36,586
It's love

1131
02:10:53,687 --> 02:10:58,692
Like butterflies, we flit around...

1132
02:10:59,109 --> 02:11:04,114
...we cast a spell with
our beauty, our look kills

1133
02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:14,332
Come to me, my love

1134
02:12:10,430 --> 02:12:15,018
What's now will be gone tomorrow.
And that is the truth

1135
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:20,023
Enjoy life every moment.
You have very little time

1136
02:12:42,754 --> 02:12:47,550
Come closer, don't go away.
Give me a kiss

1137
02:12:47,967 --> 02:12:52,972
My lips are full of desire,
kiss them

1138
02:12:58,186 --> 02:13:03,191
Come to me, my love

1139
02:13:04,859 --> 02:13:08,196
You and I meet, so our hearts...

1140
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:13,827
...so come to me, my love

1141
02:13:15,912 --> 02:13:18,206
Love is all about having fun...

1142
02:13:18,331 --> 02:13:20,834
...making merry, what
else is it all about?

1143
02:13:20,917 --> 02:13:25,714
Have fun, while you live

1144
02:13:30,927 --> 02:13:36,141
Come to me, my love

1145
02:13:50,321 --> 02:13:53,241
It's love

1146
02:14:50,799 --> 02:14:53,301
What do the reports say?

1147
02:14:55,804 --> 02:14:59,557
There's bad news.
- Are my days numbered?

1148
02:15:00,183 --> 02:15:03,311
It's bad news for me, not you.
- Meaning?

1149
02:15:05,188 --> 02:15:11,653
How can it be good news for a
doctor if his patients get well?

1150
02:15:15,198 --> 02:15:17,701
Being healthy is not everything,
Ashwin.

1151
02:15:19,786 --> 02:15:22,706
A person who is drowned in sorrows...

1152
02:15:24,582 --> 02:15:30,213
...remains ill from within, even if
he appears healthy on the exterior.

1153
02:15:30,714 --> 02:15:32,507
Why do you think that way?

1154
02:15:32,716 --> 02:15:37,512
How often have I told you
to let bygones be bygones!

1155
02:15:37,929 --> 02:15:40,432
How can I forget it?

1156
02:15:40,849 --> 02:15:45,228
One day, for greed of money...

1157
02:15:46,479 --> 02:15:53,778
...I left my home, my family,
and came here.

1158
02:15:55,030 --> 02:16:00,243
What do I have today? Only wealth!

1159
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:10,253
And unfortunately, I don't even
have pictures of my wife and son.

1160
02:16:10,879 --> 02:16:12,547
Tea!

1161
02:16:13,381 --> 02:16:17,135
Here's your tea... Keep it here.

1162
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:24,017
Hey, don't bother!
- It's no bother.

1163
02:16:24,851 --> 02:16:27,979
Uncle, do you have a
'dhoti' and ' kurta' to wear?

1164
02:16:28,605 --> 02:16:31,524
I don't quite understand.

1165
02:16:31,941 --> 02:16:37,572
I have kept a religious ceremony
tomorrow. Come with your wife.

1166
02:16:38,198 --> 02:16:41,743
I'll surely come.
- Come by 11 O'clock.

1167
02:16:42,369 --> 02:16:46,539
Here's your tea... without sugar.

1168
02:16:48,208 --> 02:16:52,379
Anything else? I'll go, I
have a lot of work to do.

1169
02:16:54,464 --> 02:17:01,971
Sometimes, I wonder how
this simple girl reached here.

1170
02:17:03,431 --> 02:17:05,934
She looks after me, like a mother.

1171
02:17:06,768 --> 02:17:11,356
I am sure we shared some
bond in our last life.

1172
02:17:13,858 --> 02:17:18,446
But sometimes, I even feel dejected.

1173
02:17:20,532 --> 02:17:23,034
She hasn't come here forever.

1174
02:17:25,328 --> 02:17:27,831
Suppose she leaves someday, then?

1175
02:17:30,125 --> 02:17:35,547
If you want, then you
can keep her here forever.

1176
02:17:37,215 --> 02:17:39,092
How?

1177
02:17:40,969 --> 02:17:43,471
Make her your daughter-in-law.

1178
02:17:44,723 --> 02:17:50,770
No, Ashwin. You know
how spoilt Karan is.

1179
02:17:52,856 --> 02:17:58,486
I cannot ruin somebody
else's life to make his life.

1180
02:17:59,112 --> 02:18:01,406
Why are you being cynical?

1181
02:18:01,614 --> 02:18:06,619
Your life has
improved after Pooja came.

1182
02:18:07,245 --> 02:18:10,790
Maybe, even Karan's life could
improve, after he gets married.

1183
02:18:20,175 --> 02:18:24,971
You must be thinking that I
give you bland food everyday.

1184
02:18:26,431 --> 02:18:30,393
Too much of oily and
spicy food is not healthy.

1185
02:18:31,019 --> 02:18:35,607
Until I'm here, you will
have to eat what I give you.

1186
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:42,280
I want to discuss something with you.

1187
02:18:42,822 --> 02:18:44,991
Yes?

1188
02:18:45,325 --> 02:18:51,039
Remember, I had spoken
to you about my son?

1189
02:18:52,916 --> 02:18:59,798
I was thinking that if he
were to have a nice girl...

1190
02:19:00,632 --> 02:19:05,637
...his life could
change for the better.

1191
02:19:05,845 --> 02:19:11,768
You are right. Find a nice girl,
and get him married.

1192
02:19:11,893 --> 02:19:17,732
I have found a nice girl.
- Really? Who is she?

1193
02:19:20,235 --> 02:19:22,112
You.

1194
02:19:27,534 --> 02:19:33,164
If there is a boy in
your life, then tell me.

1195
02:19:33,665 --> 02:19:35,458
Well...

1196
02:19:44,009 --> 02:19:47,762
No.
- I want...

1197
02:19:50,473 --> 02:19:55,687
...you to become my daughter-in-law,
and stay here forever.

1198
02:19:59,441 --> 02:20:01,943
I...

1199
02:20:04,237 --> 02:20:06,740
I will not force you.

1200
02:20:07,365 --> 02:20:11,536
But I want you to meet my
son once and understand him.

1201
02:20:12,162 --> 02:20:14,664
Then think, and give me an answer.

1202
02:20:40,732 --> 02:20:49,282
Without you, my heart knows no peace

1203
02:21:02,629 --> 02:21:11,179
Without you, my heart knows no peace

1204
02:21:29,114 --> 02:21:32,867
If only I could take a look at you...

1205
02:21:39,958 --> 02:21:43,503
...come to me, my love

1206
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:52,470
Without you, my heart knows no peace

1207
02:22:14,576 --> 02:22:18,121
Loveleen, you're here? I
took the tea to your room.

1208
02:22:22,500 --> 02:22:25,003
Hey, the tea will get cold.

1209
02:22:27,297 --> 02:22:29,799
What's this?

1210
02:22:31,259 --> 02:22:36,264
I drank too much at night.
My head feels heavy.

1211
02:22:40,852 --> 02:22:42,729
You drink so much!

1212
02:22:42,937 --> 02:22:46,066
You brought everything else,
but where is the holy water?

1213
02:22:46,274 --> 02:22:50,028
I spoke to the priest over the phone.
He'll bring the holy water.

1214
02:22:50,445 --> 02:22:53,782
At least, under the pretext of
buying some things, you went out!

1215
02:22:54,407 --> 02:22:56,493
Thanks to Pooja!

1216
02:22:56,701 --> 02:22:59,621
A holy ritual is being done here
for the first time because of her.

1217
02:23:00,038 --> 02:23:02,540
But where is the priest?
- He must be on his way.

1218
02:23:07,545 --> 02:23:11,508
Here are the flowers. All
the arrangements are done.

1219
02:23:11,716 --> 02:23:14,844
What is a policeman doing in my house?

1220
02:23:15,053 --> 02:23:21,309
He is Jack Patel. He is a
policeman as well as a priest.

1221
02:23:21,518 --> 02:23:22,977
He will be conducting the ritual.

1222
02:23:23,186 --> 02:23:25,897
A policeman and a priest? Two-in-one?!

1223
02:23:26,731 --> 02:23:29,859
He serves America
from Monday to Friday.

1224
02:23:30,068 --> 02:23:32,987
And serves the Lord
during the weekends.

1225
02:23:33,196 --> 02:23:37,575
He is a stern officer, but
a kindhearted human being.

1226
02:23:38,201 --> 02:23:41,329
Good social service, I must say.

1227
02:23:41,538 --> 02:23:44,457
Hello, Pooja! Greetings! - Greetings!

1228
02:23:46,126 --> 02:23:49,254
This contains the items
needed for the ritual.

1229
02:23:49,379 --> 02:23:52,799
Decorate it, while I go and change.

1230
02:23:53,133 --> 02:23:56,136
Where is the
changing room? - This way.

1231
02:24:08,231 --> 02:24:11,151
Dad, I need to talk to you.
- What's this?!

1232
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:15,113
You can see that a religious ritual
is on. Remove your shoes outside.

1233
02:24:15,739 --> 02:24:16,156
Oh, shut up!

1234
02:24:16,781 --> 02:24:21,369
This is my house! Dad, who is
she to order me in my own house?

1235
02:24:21,995 --> 02:24:26,374
She is Pooja. Obey her!

1236
02:24:26,791 --> 02:24:32,213
Remove your shoes outside.
Then come and sit here.

1237
02:24:33,131 --> 02:24:36,176
I don't believe in all this!
Come on, I want to talk to you.

1238
02:24:36,801 --> 02:24:39,929
Can't you see, the ritual is
going to begin? Sit down quietly!

1239
02:24:40,555 --> 02:24:43,683
I don't have time for such
futile things! I want money!

1240
02:25:00,158 --> 02:25:04,746
Why are you making a fool of me?!
- You have made a fool of me!

1241
02:25:05,163 --> 02:25:11,211
That tuppence worth accountant,
Mehta, dared to refuse me money!

1242
02:25:11,628 --> 02:25:14,547
You will not get a penny!
- Why not?!

1243
02:25:14,756 --> 02:25:19,344
Because I've toiled hard,
day and night...

1244
02:25:19,427 --> 02:25:22,889
...to earn the money
which you blow on your vices!

1245
02:25:23,098 --> 02:25:27,477
I've made great sacrifices! You
have spent a lot of money so far!

1246
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:31,022
But I don't have a
penny more for you now!

1247
02:25:31,439 --> 02:25:35,610
I desperately need money!

1248
02:25:36,861 --> 02:25:39,364
All right!

1249
02:25:40,824 --> 02:25:43,743
You can get money on
one condition. - What?

1250
02:25:43,952 --> 02:25:47,706
You will have to marry
the girl you saw outside.

1251
02:25:48,206 --> 02:25:52,919
What? Marry? Never! - Then,
money? Never!!

1252
02:25:53,336 --> 02:25:57,298
Try to understand! I owe a debt!

1253
02:25:57,590 --> 02:26:02,303
And my creditors are very
dangerous people! They can do anything!

1254
02:26:02,429 --> 02:26:04,806
Why don't you understand?

1255
02:26:04,931 --> 02:26:07,308
I don't want to understand!

1256
02:26:08,143 --> 02:26:13,565
Karan, you always make some excuse,
and take money from me.

1257
02:26:14,190 --> 02:26:16,901
But none of your excuses
are going to work anymore!

1258
02:26:17,527 --> 02:26:21,072
I am not going to be convinced!

1259
02:26:21,698 --> 02:26:27,537
If you marry Pooja, you'll get
the money, else, you will not!

1260
02:26:41,092 --> 02:26:45,055
Are you guys doing ok,
get yourself another drink.

1261
02:26:49,851 --> 02:26:52,771
Hey, Karan, what's the matter?
Why are you sitting alone?

1262
02:26:54,522 --> 02:26:56,024
Is something wrong?

1263
02:26:56,107 --> 02:27:00,904
You appear very tense.
- My father...

1264
02:27:02,781 --> 02:27:05,283
He has made my life a hell!

1265
02:27:06,117 --> 02:27:08,620
Why do you abuse your father?

1266
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:14,459
He is my father! I'll say anything
to him. Who are you to interfere?!

1267
02:27:14,668 --> 02:27:17,170
I didn't abuse your father, did I?

1268
02:27:20,090 --> 02:27:24,678
Okay, your drink is over... Rohan,
bring Karan some whisky and water.

1269
02:27:26,971 --> 02:27:29,474
And wine for me.

1270
02:27:29,683 --> 02:27:33,645
Hey, come on, it's okay, Karan.

1271
02:27:34,062 --> 02:27:37,399
Relax, just chill out.

1272
02:27:38,233 --> 02:27:43,655
Why does he have to interfere?!
I know what my problem is!

1273
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:46,574
Cool it, come on. - Bloody idiot.

1274
02:28:23,361 --> 02:28:25,780
All the best to you and your guy.

1275
02:28:25,864 --> 02:28:29,117
Loveleen, I have to talk to you.
- Rohan, where are our drinks?

1276
02:28:29,325 --> 02:28:33,496
Please come out.
- Hey! Where are you taking me?

1277
02:28:33,580 --> 02:28:34,831
Just come with me!

1278
02:28:34,956 --> 02:28:37,667
Just hang on. What's the problem?

1279
02:28:38,501 --> 02:28:41,629
What's wrong?
- I disapprove of all this!

1280
02:28:42,255 --> 02:28:47,052
Of what?
- This atmosphere... your friends!

1281
02:28:48,094 --> 02:28:50,805
I have been in these
surroundings since childhood.

1282
02:28:50,889 --> 02:28:56,436
And now, even you have to stay here.
So you will have to accept all this.

1283
02:28:56,853 --> 02:28:59,564
What's wrong in it?!

1284
02:29:00,398 --> 02:29:03,943
Wrong?! Wearing such clothes...

1285
02:29:04,152 --> 02:29:08,948
...drinking, smoking, disrespecting
elders! Do you deem them as good?!

1286
02:29:10,408 --> 02:29:13,536
Coyness is the treasure of girls!

1287
02:29:13,953 --> 02:29:18,958
To discard it, and expose oneself,
is not in our culture!

1288
02:29:19,376 --> 02:29:23,546
This is my culture. If it's
not yours, I'm not to be blamed!

1289
02:29:24,172 --> 02:29:27,092
You have known
everything about me beforehand.

1290
02:29:27,384 --> 02:29:33,348
I'd thought I would
change you... but you cannot.

1291
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:39,604
That's your fault! And you are the
one who has got to change, not me!

1292
02:29:40,855 --> 02:29:45,652
If you want to marry me, you
will have to accept this culture.

1293
02:29:46,611 --> 02:29:50,240
There is a vast
difference between our cultures.

1294
02:29:51,074 --> 02:29:54,828
There is no place in
it for a girl like you.

1295
02:29:55,537 --> 02:30:00,250
A girl like me?! What do you mean?!

1296
02:30:00,667 --> 02:30:03,378
What about yourself?!
What's your position in life?!

1297
02:30:04,004 --> 02:30:07,340
That girl is perfect for you!

1298
02:30:07,549 --> 02:30:10,260
Pooja, that bloody bitch!
- Don't you dare!

1299
02:30:10,677 --> 02:30:13,805
Don't you dare speak ill about Pooja!

1300
02:30:14,848 --> 02:30:17,350
Pooja and you are poles apart!

1301
02:30:20,687 --> 02:30:24,858
I have realised today that
by forsaking her for you...

1302
02:30:24,941 --> 02:30:28,194
...I have made the
biggest mistake of my life!

1303
02:30:28,611 --> 02:30:32,991
Then, go back to her, to that
place from where I had picked you!

1304
02:30:33,408 --> 02:30:36,745
You deserve to be there, not here!

1305
02:30:37,162 --> 02:30:41,124
It's not your fault but mine.

1306
02:30:43,001 --> 02:30:50,717
In order to become rich, I'd put my
culture and self-respect at stake!

1307
02:30:52,802 --> 02:30:55,305
But my eyes have opened now.

1308
02:30:56,765 --> 02:31:00,935
I will not put my conscience at
stake now to become a rich man!

1309
02:31:03,021 --> 02:31:06,566
Keep your surroundings,
culture and friends to yourself!

1310
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:09,486
I'm going!

1311
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:07,669
Loneliness stings

1312
02:32:09,963 --> 02:32:16,219
My own shadow pinches me

1313
02:32:17,470 --> 02:32:25,395
My eyes long, shed tears...

1314
02:32:26,021 --> 02:32:33,737
...they neither sleep, nor awake

1315
02:32:34,362 --> 02:32:37,282
What am I to do?

1316
02:32:44,789 --> 02:32:48,126
...come and tell me

1317
02:32:48,752 --> 02:32:57,302
Without you, my heart knows no peace

1318
02:34:01,324 --> 02:34:04,452
You here, so late at night?
What's wrong?

1319
02:34:08,623 --> 02:34:11,751
Hey! What's the matter?

1320
02:34:20,719 --> 02:34:23,221
Rohan, what's wrong?

1321
02:34:29,477 --> 02:34:35,734
I made a grave mistake!

1322
02:34:43,241 --> 02:34:45,744
Lqbalbhai and Sardarbhai...

1323
02:34:48,246 --> 02:34:52,417
...gave place to a
homeless person like me...

1324
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:55,003
...not only in their house
but in their hearts too.

1325
02:34:59,090 --> 02:35:01,593
And I ended up breaking their hearts.

1326
02:35:09,726 --> 02:35:15,774
She really loved me, but I
failed to realise her true love!

1327
02:35:19,527 --> 02:35:25,367
Only because I was pursuing a
farcical and pretentious life!

1328
02:35:32,457 --> 02:35:34,959
I can never forgive myself!

1329
02:35:37,253 --> 02:35:42,050
I know, you will
never forgive yourself.

1330
02:35:42,467 --> 02:35:48,515
But Sardar & lqbal are very noble.
They will surely forgive you.

1331
02:35:49,349 --> 02:35:55,814
And Pooja... she is a goddess. Can
the love of a goddess lack anything?

1332
02:35:58,525 --> 02:36:03,738
Tell me something. Do
you really love Pooja?

1333
02:36:04,989 --> 02:36:09,160
I realised just today
that I love her very much.

1334
02:36:11,246 --> 02:36:13,748
Pooja is my love.

1335
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,545
I cannot live without
her for even a moment now.

1336
02:36:21,047 --> 02:36:25,010
But how can I face her?

1337
02:36:25,218 --> 02:36:27,095
Hey, come on.

1338
02:36:27,303 --> 02:36:31,266
People truly in love, do
not remain angry forever.

1339
02:36:31,474 --> 02:36:37,313
They get upset for a while,
and one has to pacify them.

1340
02:36:38,857 --> 02:36:40,442
Let's go.

1341
02:36:49,075 --> 02:36:51,286
Everybody must be asleep.

1342
02:36:51,703 --> 02:36:55,248
Really? I'll wake them up right away.

1343
02:37:35,580 --> 02:37:38,833
Mr. Patel, why have
you brought him here?

1344
02:37:39,668 --> 02:37:43,004
If he has committed a crime,
imprison him!

1345
02:37:43,421 --> 02:37:46,758
I have nothing to do
with him. He is dead for me!

1346
02:37:48,009 --> 02:37:53,640
Mete out any punishment to him.
We have nothing to do with him!

1347
02:37:53,848 --> 02:37:55,809
What are you talking?

1348
02:37:55,934 --> 02:37:59,688
I have wronged all
of you, not the law.

1349
02:38:00,105 --> 02:38:02,607
You will punish me, not the law!

1350
02:38:03,233 --> 02:38:08,238
But I don't know who you are! We
have nothing to do with each other!

1351
02:38:08,446 --> 02:38:10,573
Mr. Patel, take him away!

1352
02:38:10,949 --> 02:38:13,868
Mete out any punishment,
but please don't say this!

1353
02:38:15,537 --> 02:38:17,080
Forgive me, I'm sorry please.

1354
02:38:17,205 --> 02:38:23,878
The boy is apologising! Forgive him,
he won't repeat this mistake.

1355
02:38:24,087 --> 02:38:26,172
Chaurasia, do not come in the middle!

1356
02:38:26,381 --> 02:38:30,343
Okay, I'll go to the side.
At least now, forgive him.

1357
02:38:30,552 --> 02:38:33,054
After all, he is younger than you!

1358
02:38:33,263 --> 02:38:38,476
But he is a big shot! We
are jealous of his progress!

1359
02:38:38,685 --> 02:38:40,979
Our hearts burn!

1360
02:38:41,187 --> 02:38:46,192
You were a person who wanted to
move ahead, and never look back!

1361
02:38:46,317 --> 02:38:48,903
How did you turn back today?!

1362
02:38:49,112 --> 02:38:53,908
And this is not a society of the
elite, but of the poor like us!

1363
02:38:54,325 --> 02:38:59,122
Go back to the elite society!
What are you doing here?!

1364
02:38:59,330 --> 02:39:02,876
Ok guys, cut it off.

1365
02:39:02,959 --> 02:39:06,838
Enough of your histrionics! He
seeks forgiveness, so pardon him!

1366
02:39:07,047 --> 02:39:10,592
You can't force us!
- Yes, I can.

1367
02:39:11,009 --> 02:39:16,014
Forgive him, and take him to your
place, hey you! Which is your house?

1368
02:39:16,556 --> 02:39:18,516
Move.

1369
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:22,479
Hey, how can he go? This is my house!

1370
02:39:22,687 --> 02:39:27,692
Rohan, you're back?
What is the matter?

1371
02:39:27,901 --> 02:39:31,237
They are not letting
me enter the house.

1372
02:39:31,446 --> 02:39:35,825
How will they not let you?
I am here. Go in.

1373
02:39:36,242 --> 02:39:37,702
Hey, how can he?

1374
02:39:37,911 --> 02:39:41,664
You are a cop, and yet break
the law? Even I know the law!

1375
02:39:41,873 --> 02:39:45,835
I see! You do?
- Most certainly!

1376
02:39:46,461 --> 02:39:50,632
Just because you are a cop, does not
mean you can push anyone in my house!

1377
02:39:53,134 --> 02:39:56,471
I am going to teach
both of you about law.

1378
02:39:58,556 --> 02:40:01,476
For what?
- I am arresting both of you.

1379
02:40:02,310 --> 02:40:05,230
But what is our crime?
- Crime?

1380
02:40:06,064 --> 02:40:11,903
Lqbal Singh and you abused an
officer, Jack Patel, on duty.

1381
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:15,031
What!
- When did we abuse you?

1382
02:40:15,448 --> 02:40:18,576
Just now.
- Hey! You are falsely accusing us!

1383
02:40:18,785 --> 02:40:22,330
What proof do you have?
- Oh! Proof?

1384
02:40:23,456 --> 02:40:26,918
Mr. Chaurasia, did they abuse me?

1385
02:40:27,127 --> 02:40:31,506
Let alone America, I haven't heard
such abuses even in my hometown!

1386
02:40:31,631 --> 02:40:34,134
I won't spare you!
- You lie!

1387
02:40:36,511 --> 02:40:40,056
Mr. Vaswani, did they abuse me?

1388
02:40:47,147 --> 02:40:52,569
I'll beat you so badly that
you'll wet your pants, understand?

1389
02:40:53,194 --> 02:40:54,863
Did they abuse me?

1390
02:40:55,071 --> 02:41:01,953
He abused so harshly that
I've gone deaf! - Alright!

1391
02:41:05,290 --> 02:41:09,044
Two witnesses are
enough to arrest you.

1392
02:41:11,546 --> 02:41:16,343
Now, will you take him inside or
should I put you inside the jail?

1393
02:41:22,390 --> 02:41:24,893
Rohan, go inside.

1394
02:41:55,757 --> 02:41:58,259
You are a real brat!

1395
02:41:59,094 --> 02:42:03,056
You are very adamant; you
did succeed in pacifying us!

1396
02:42:03,264 --> 02:42:05,767
Please don't play such pranks.

1397
02:42:07,644 --> 02:42:14,317
We weren't angry either. We said
all this because we were hurt.

1398
02:42:17,237 --> 02:42:19,322
- Don't repeat this, okay? - Okay.

1399
02:42:19,531 --> 02:42:21,825
Else, I swear by God,
I will not spare you!

1400
02:42:26,621 --> 02:42:32,252
Fantastic, dear! We were the ones
who lied, and you embrace only them!

1401
02:42:32,669 --> 02:42:36,214
It isn't so. I'll embrace you too.

1402
02:42:43,722 --> 02:42:49,978
Mr. Patel, you punished me
for a crime I did not commit.

1403
02:42:50,395 --> 02:42:54,566
So I think I will commit a crime.
- Meaning?

1404
02:42:54,816 --> 02:43:00,196
Mr. Patel, you are a
wretched scoundrel!

1405
02:43:00,613 --> 02:43:03,950
What did you say?!
- I committed the crime!

1406
02:43:06,661 --> 02:43:09,581
You weren't offended, were you?

1407
02:43:10,415 --> 02:43:12,917
It's alright.

1408
02:43:14,169 --> 02:43:16,671
Ok, bye, guys.

1409
02:43:16,796 --> 02:43:20,842
You really tormented us, Rohan!
- Happiness has returned now.

1410
02:43:21,051 --> 02:43:25,013
Are both of you happy now? Look,
he's bidding goodbye.

1411
02:43:27,307 --> 02:43:29,809
Where is Pooja?

1412
02:43:31,686 --> 02:43:36,483
She's gone.
- Gone?! Where?

1413
02:43:52,791 --> 02:43:55,877
I have come to meet Pooja.
- You are...

1414
02:43:56,169 --> 02:43:57,754
I am her friend.

1415
02:43:57,962 --> 02:44:01,925
She left with Mr. Balraj yesterday
for a conference in Springfield.

1416
02:44:04,219 --> 02:44:06,721
When will she return?
- Within 3-4 days.

1417
02:44:11,726 --> 02:44:13,603
The address?

1418
02:44:27,575 --> 02:44:30,120
Hi! I was wondering if I could
speak to a Miss Pooja Walia...

1419
02:44:30,245 --> 02:44:32,747
...who is staying with you.
- Sure.

1420
02:44:38,211 --> 02:44:40,714
Yes, I'll be there
in about 10 minutes.

1421
02:44:40,839 --> 02:44:43,008
Thank you very much again.
- You're welcome.

1422
02:44:43,091 --> 02:44:45,927
I'm going with them to
the site. You go and rest.

1423
02:44:46,761 --> 02:44:50,932
Well it was nice having
met you, bye. - Good bye.

1424
02:45:10,952 --> 02:45:16,583
Pooja, wait! Please! I
have come to seek forgiveness.

1425
02:45:18,460 --> 02:45:22,213
I realised how much I love you,
after being separated from you.

1426
02:45:22,422 --> 02:45:24,924
I cannot live without you!

1427
02:45:25,133 --> 02:45:28,261
I won't be at peace
till you forgive me!

1428
02:45:29,721 --> 02:45:33,892
I know I have hurt you very much.

1429
02:45:34,100 --> 02:45:37,020
I am your culprit,
but I have changed now.

1430
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:40,565
Pooja, please!

1431
02:45:58,083 --> 02:46:01,419
Pooja, I'll be a bit late.
So do the packing.

1432
02:46:01,836 --> 02:46:03,922
We have to reach New
York this evening.

1433
02:46:04,130 --> 02:46:06,007
Okay.

1434
02:47:20,874 --> 02:47:23,168
What is it that you want?

1435
02:47:23,376 --> 02:47:25,879
Pooja, I...
- I don't want to hear a thing!

1436
02:47:26,713 --> 02:47:29,215
What do you think of yourself?!

1437
02:47:29,424 --> 02:47:32,969
That you can reject and
accept me whenever you please?!

1438
02:47:37,349 --> 02:47:39,851
Your hand is profusely bleeding!

1439
02:47:41,519 --> 02:47:44,022
Why did you have to put
your hand in the lift?

1440
02:47:44,647 --> 02:47:48,818
Suppose, something had happened?
I don't care!

1441
02:47:50,070 --> 02:47:55,492
Why should I care about
you when you don't, about me?

1442
02:48:02,582 --> 02:48:07,170
When she broke your heart, you
came to seek my forgiveness!

1443
02:48:08,838 --> 02:48:13,426
If you find another girl tomorrow,
will you run behind her?!

1444
02:48:15,095 --> 02:48:18,431
Then go! Why have you come here?!

1445
02:48:19,557 --> 02:48:21,142
I hate you!

1446
02:48:21,267 --> 02:48:23,645
Please don't leave me, Pooja!

1447
02:48:26,356 --> 02:48:29,901
Come, let's return.

1448
02:48:32,195 --> 02:48:36,783
To our people, to our colony.

1449
02:48:39,077 --> 02:48:46,167
Where there is love, a
feeling of oneness and peace.

1450
02:49:04,769 --> 02:49:07,856
The earth is as
beautiful as a bride...

1451
02:49:08,064 --> 02:49:11,401
...and the vast skies open for us

1452
02:49:19,743 --> 02:49:23,288
The earth is as
beautiful as a bride...

1453
02:49:23,496 --> 02:49:26,624
...and the vast skies open for us

1454
02:49:27,459 --> 02:49:34,341
The world of
desires beckons us again

1455
02:49:35,383 --> 02:49:39,971
Come, let us return

1456
02:49:50,815 --> 02:49:55,820
Come, let's return

1457
02:50:39,823 --> 02:50:43,785
I was such an ignorant fool...

1458
02:50:43,993 --> 02:50:47,956
...I couldn't see
how much you loved me

1459
02:50:51,710 --> 02:50:55,463
But now that you drive me restless...

1460
02:50:55,672 --> 02:50:59,634
...I come to you

1461
02:51:02,345 --> 02:51:09,853
In your breath, lies my life.
My heart is where you live

1462
02:51:10,311 --> 02:51:17,777
Our world is more
beautiful than the heavens

1463
02:51:18,611 --> 02:51:25,493
Without you, I can't
find peace anywhere

1464
02:51:26,953 --> 02:51:31,541
Come, let's return

1465
02:51:42,177 --> 02:51:47,182
Come, let's return

1466
02:52:50,787 --> 02:52:58,712
Not for a day, not for a moment,
will I ever be parted from you

1467
02:53:02,340 --> 02:53:10,181
In your eyes, I shall
see my celestial bed

1468
02:53:13,351 --> 02:53:20,608
I'll love you, and be
lost in your fragrance...

1469
02:53:21,109 --> 02:53:28,324
...to go to sleep in
your arms is all I desire

1470
02:53:29,784 --> 02:53:36,458
No longer do I want to bear
the pain inflicted on my heart

1471
02:53:37,292 --> 02:53:42,714
So come, let's return

1472
02:53:52,724 --> 02:53:57,729
Come, let's return

1473
02:54:00,440 --> 02:54:05,236
Come, let's return

1474
02:55:12,595 --> 02:55:15,098
Pooja, she is my mother.

1475
02:55:16,975 --> 02:55:19,894
I love my mother the most,
in this world.

1476
02:55:26,985 --> 02:55:29,487
Today, I give it to you.

1477
02:55:34,909 --> 02:55:38,455
This is the proof that
reflects how much I love you.

1478
02:55:40,331 --> 02:55:42,834
And I will marry only you.

1479
02:55:44,919 --> 02:55:48,465
I'll change this locket
into a ' mangalsutra' soon.

1480
02:55:55,347 --> 02:55:58,683
Rohan, we'll meet in New York.

1481
02:56:00,143 --> 02:56:05,148
Uncle Balraj is returning today,
I'll also have to go.

1482
02:56:07,442 --> 02:56:13,698
You'll reach by plane
today itself. I'll take a day.

1483
02:56:14,949 --> 02:56:17,452
I'll come by bus.

1484
02:56:36,429 --> 02:56:38,932
You appear very happy.

1485
02:56:41,851 --> 02:56:45,605
Did you buy this here?

1486
02:56:46,439 --> 02:56:49,567
No. Rohan has given it to me.

1487
02:56:52,278 --> 02:56:58,326
Who is Rohan?
- Well, he's the boy I love.

1488
02:56:58,827 --> 02:57:06,042
When I'd asked you the other day if
there was a boy in your life, you...

1489
02:57:06,251 --> 02:57:12,298
He was not a part of my life then.
He had left me for a rich girl.

1490
02:57:13,133 --> 02:57:17,095
But he has come back now. He
had come to meet me even here.

1491
02:57:17,512 --> 02:57:21,057
Shall I tell you something?
- Yes.

1492
02:57:23,351 --> 02:57:26,062
When a person leaves his
own people for money...

1493
02:57:28,148 --> 02:57:31,067
...it's very
difficult for him to return.

1494
02:57:32,110 --> 02:57:38,575
Rohan is not such a boy, he's very
nice. He even wants to marry me.

1495
02:57:42,120 --> 02:57:46,291
I think the Lord has
still not forgiven me.

1496
02:57:48,793 --> 02:57:54,007
Whenever I sight happiness, it's
snatched away before I can get it.

1497
02:57:55,467 --> 02:58:02,140
The yearning to see you as my
daughter-in-law remained a desire.

1498
02:58:06,311 --> 02:58:08,813
You?
- You didn't come to meet me...

1499
02:58:10,482 --> 02:58:15,487
...so I thought I'd meet you.
- I was going to come and...

1500
02:58:15,570 --> 02:58:19,240
Don't give me this bullshit!

1501
02:58:19,324 --> 02:58:21,743
How many messages I sent!

1502
02:58:22,369 --> 02:58:25,914
You have to take
this packet to Chicago.

1503
02:58:27,165 --> 02:58:30,085
Here's the ticket. The
address is inside this.

1504
02:58:31,544 --> 02:58:34,047
It should reach by tomorrow evening.

1505
02:58:34,339 --> 02:58:42,389
I've told you before that I'm very
scared. Please don't make me do this!

1506
02:58:42,597 --> 02:58:45,100
No problem!

1507
02:58:45,308 --> 02:58:47,185
Then repay Marco's money.

1508
02:58:47,394 --> 02:58:51,356
I have not refused to repay him.
I'll repay when I have the money.

1509
02:58:51,481 --> 02:58:54,275
Where will I get so much money from?
- From your father.

1510
02:58:55,110 --> 02:58:56,861
He has wealth in abundance.

1511
02:58:56,986 --> 02:59:01,157
If he were to give me money, there'd
be no need to borrow from Marco!

1512
02:59:02,617 --> 02:59:05,120
He has laid a new condition now.

1513
02:59:05,745 --> 02:59:10,542
I will not get a penny till
I marry a girl of his choice!

1514
02:59:12,836 --> 02:59:15,338
Do whatever you want to.

1515
02:59:16,381 --> 02:59:19,509
I am interested in the money,
not in your marriage!

1516
02:59:20,969 --> 02:59:27,225
And until you don't repay
the money, keep doing our work!

1517
02:59:34,315 --> 02:59:40,363
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1518
02:59:49,748 --> 02:59:55,378
You have cast a spell on my old man.
He refuses to give me money.

1519
02:59:57,255 --> 02:59:59,132
Come on.
- Where?

1520
02:59:59,549 --> 03:00:01,217
I will marry you today itself.

1521
03:00:01,426 --> 03:00:04,554
I will marry only the one that I love!

1522
03:00:05,180 --> 03:00:10,810
You will marry me, and that too,
right now! Let me see who'll stop me!

1523
03:00:11,561 --> 03:00:12,979
Leave me.

1524
03:00:13,104 --> 03:00:15,607
Let go of my hand!

1525
03:00:16,232 --> 03:00:18,943
Stop it!
- Come on! - Karan, no!

1526
03:00:19,986 --> 03:00:21,446
Come on!

1527
03:00:23,948 --> 03:00:28,536
What impertinence is this!
- She refuses to marry me!

1528
03:00:38,963 --> 03:00:45,011
You deserve that! Let alone her,
no decent girl will marry you!

1529
03:00:45,220 --> 03:00:47,305
You wanted me to marry her.

1530
03:00:48,348 --> 03:00:50,433
I was wrong.

1531
03:00:51,476 --> 03:00:55,855
I was about to be unjust to
her because of my love for you.

1532
03:00:56,481 --> 03:00:59,609
You! - Don't touch her.

1533
03:01:02,529 --> 03:01:07,325
You slapped me!
- I should have done this long back!

1534
03:01:10,453 --> 03:01:14,416
Get out! I said, get out.

1535
03:01:23,591 --> 03:01:26,094
I'm ashamed.

1536
03:01:28,179 --> 03:01:31,099
I am sorry.

1537
03:01:31,850 --> 03:01:34,352
Take this.

1538
03:01:48,825 --> 03:01:52,370
Who is she?

1539
03:01:52,579 --> 03:01:55,081
Rohan's mother.

1540
03:01:59,878 --> 03:02:02,589
What does Rohan do?

1541
03:02:03,131 --> 03:02:06,968
Nothing much. He is
looking out for a job.

1542
03:02:07,802 --> 03:02:11,973
After graduation he's done a diploma
in computers with a first class.

1543
03:02:13,016 --> 03:02:15,935
Yet...
- Ask him to come and meet me!

1544
03:02:16,144 --> 03:02:21,149
No! Ask him to come to office,
and meet Mr. Mehta.

1545
03:02:21,775 --> 03:02:24,277
He'll get a job.

1546
03:02:30,325 --> 03:02:33,453
Uncle, he's my Rohan.

1547
03:02:45,757 --> 03:02:48,885
He has come to take me.
May I go with him?

1548
03:02:51,596 --> 03:02:53,264
Yes.

1549
03:02:53,348 --> 03:02:56,184
I'll ask him to meet Mr.
Mehta tomorrow.

1550
03:02:56,810 --> 03:02:58,687
Okay.

1551
03:02:58,770 --> 03:03:00,563
Thank you, uncle!

1552
03:03:01,815 --> 03:03:05,777
Give him my love, my blessings.

1553
03:03:44,566 --> 03:03:47,277
Play the band loudly!

1554
03:04:03,960 --> 03:04:06,463
Stop the band!

1555
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:11,468
My child! Now that you're here,
joy has blossomed once again!

1556
03:04:12,510 --> 03:04:15,847
After you left, there
was a string of joys!

1557
03:04:16,264 --> 03:04:19,184
You mean, a string of sorrows!

1558
03:04:19,392 --> 03:04:22,312
I meant joy had become evasive.
- Why do I have a friend like him?

1559
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:23,772
Where is Mr. Chaurasia?

1560
03:04:23,855 --> 03:04:28,568
He is preparing ' paan' for
everyone in the joy of your return.

1561
03:04:28,985 --> 03:04:31,071
There comes my dear mister.

1562
03:04:31,696 --> 03:04:35,075
Hi! My dear Mrs. My dear
friends and countrymen.

1563
03:04:36,284 --> 03:04:39,621
To welcome my son and daughter...

1564
03:04:39,829 --> 03:04:45,460
...I have personally
prepared this Banaras ' paan'.

1565
03:04:46,086 --> 03:04:50,465
Have one... You also try.

1566
03:04:51,716 --> 03:04:54,219
What's going on here?
What's with the crowd?

1567
03:04:54,344 --> 03:04:56,721
Hey man, today is celebration!

1568
03:04:56,846 --> 03:05:00,475
This is Banarasi Paan!
Indian mouth freshner!

1569
03:05:00,558 --> 03:05:02,143
No, thank you, no, thank you!

1570
03:05:02,268 --> 03:05:04,688
Try it, try it. - Alright!

1571
03:05:04,854 --> 03:05:07,565
Try once, brother.
Just put in the mouth.

1572
03:05:08,191 --> 03:05:11,319
That's good!

1573
03:05:11,820 --> 03:05:13,405
How is it, brother?

1574
03:05:18,076 --> 03:05:19,703
Any problem?

1575
03:05:19,869 --> 03:05:21,955
He has a problem.

1576
03:05:22,163 --> 03:05:26,126
Problem number one, you
drove a taxi without a license.

1577
03:05:26,751 --> 03:05:31,131
Problem number two, you
messed around with an NRI girl.

1578
03:05:31,965 --> 03:05:38,013
If you don't want any more problems,
marry her, and find a good job.

1579
03:05:38,847 --> 03:05:40,932
I forgot to give some good news.

1580
03:05:41,141 --> 03:05:44,894
Uncle Balraj has promised to
give Rohan a job in his office.

1581
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:47,605
Really?
- Rohan, please don't forget.

1582
03:05:47,689 --> 03:05:50,734
You have to go to Uncle Balraj's
office tomorrow and meet Mr. Mehta.

1583
03:06:10,545 --> 03:06:12,339
May I come in sir?

1584
03:06:12,380 --> 03:06:13,882
Please come, Mr. Mehta.

1585
03:06:14,090 --> 03:06:18,470
Sir, I am indeed very
pleased to see you in office today.

1586
03:06:19,512 --> 03:06:22,223
Well, I am perfectly fine now.

1587
03:06:23,058 --> 03:06:27,645
My life has completely
changed after Pooja has come.

1588
03:06:30,148 --> 03:06:32,650
Rohan has joined us, hasn't he?
- Yes.

1589
03:06:34,319 --> 03:06:36,821
How is the boy?
- Very intelligent.

1590
03:06:37,655 --> 03:06:42,243
I have given him some accounting
work. He has grasped it very soon.

1591
03:06:43,286 --> 03:06:45,997
Very good.

1592
03:06:46,623 --> 03:06:48,291
After all, whose son is he!

1593
03:07:26,955 --> 03:07:29,416
What are you saying, Balraj?!
- Yes, Ashwin!

1594
03:07:29,582 --> 03:07:32,919
My son is right in front of me!

1595
03:07:33,753 --> 03:07:38,967
But I lack the courage
to go and embrace him.

1596
03:07:39,592 --> 03:07:43,763
Don't worry. I'll go and talk to him.

1597
03:07:44,180 --> 03:07:48,768
No, don't talk to him! Suppose
he leaves, in a fit of fury, then?

1598
03:07:49,394 --> 03:07:53,773
At least now, I am happy
because he is near me.

1599
03:07:55,650 --> 03:07:59,404
What is it? You
appear a bit worked up.

1600
03:07:59,612 --> 03:08:06,703
No, I'm not... Tell me,
how is your Rohan?

1601
03:08:07,120 --> 03:08:11,916
He's very happy. He wants
to meet you and thank you.

1602
03:08:12,334 --> 03:08:14,836
I will meet him.

1603
03:08:16,504 --> 03:08:20,258
I will surely meet him someday.
- Okay, meet him later.

1604
03:08:20,884 --> 03:08:25,055
But do talk to him over the phone
for a while, he'll be very happy.

1605
03:08:40,070 --> 03:08:43,406
Hello Rohan. - Hi, Pooja.

1606
03:08:43,740 --> 03:08:46,743
Where are you calling from?
- From Uncle Balraj's house.

1607
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:49,037
Speak to him.

1608
03:08:51,247 --> 03:08:53,208
Take this.

1609
03:09:01,758 --> 03:09:05,095
Sir, thank you very much.

1610
03:09:05,720 --> 03:09:09,683
I'll be indebted to you
forever for giving me a job.

1611
03:09:10,016 --> 03:09:13,436
It's no favour, it was my duty.

1612
03:09:14,270 --> 03:09:19,901
Duty?
- Yes. Even I need you.

1613
03:09:20,735 --> 03:09:24,906
I mean, everybody needs a
person who does his job well.

1614
03:09:26,574 --> 03:09:31,162
And then, you are somebody
my own, from my country.

1615
03:09:31,788 --> 03:09:34,290
Shall I tell you something?

1616
03:09:34,499 --> 03:09:38,044
Incidentally, even my
father's name was Balraj Khanna.

1617
03:09:39,713 --> 03:09:45,343
Was?
- Yes. He's no more.

1618
03:09:46,803 --> 03:09:51,599
Son, never talk about your
father in the past tense.

1619
03:09:53,059 --> 03:09:56,187
A child always bears
his father's name.

1620
03:09:57,856 --> 03:10:00,984
Irrespective of
whether he is alive or dead.

1621
03:10:03,903 --> 03:10:06,406
My father's name is Balraj Khanna.

1622
03:10:09,534 --> 03:10:11,828
Who else is there in your house?

1623
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:14,748
My grandpa and mother.

1624
03:10:15,790 --> 03:10:18,293
I am here because of them.

1625
03:10:19,753 --> 03:10:23,089
Sir, they have had to endure
many hardships to raise me.

1626
03:10:23,715 --> 03:10:29,763
So I want to earn lots of money and
bestow every joy of the world on them.

1627
03:10:33,516 --> 03:10:36,227
God will bring you prosperity.

1628
03:10:38,938 --> 03:10:41,441
My blessings are with you.

1629
03:10:43,943 --> 03:10:46,696
Thank you, sir.

1630
03:10:52,077 --> 03:10:54,579
Tears in your eyes?

1631
03:10:57,165 --> 03:11:02,504
Nothing's the matter. When
I was speaking to Rohan...

1632
03:11:04,798 --> 03:11:13,765
...I realised what good
upbringing and culture means.

1633
03:11:17,102 --> 03:11:25,235
There's Karan, who doesn't even
possess the decorum to speak to me.

1634
03:11:27,737 --> 03:11:33,785
And there's Rohan. His mother has
raised him with great difficulties.

1635
03:11:38,123 --> 03:11:43,169
She has instilled such
impeccable manners in him.

1636
03:11:43,670 --> 03:11:45,046
Excuse me, sir!

1637
03:11:45,171 --> 03:11:47,340
Come, Rohan.

1638
03:11:47,632 --> 03:11:52,345
Yes, sir! - Mr. Khanna has
given you $5,000 in advance.

1639
03:12:05,483 --> 03:12:07,986
Both of you are not at all
ashamed to eat free meals!

1640
03:12:08,403 --> 03:12:11,531
I ask you to change the bedsheets in
the room, but you say, it's dirty!

1641
03:12:11,948 --> 03:12:16,369
And you! If a customer asks you
for booze, you feel mortified!

1642
03:12:16,536 --> 03:12:19,247
You will have no
complaints about them now.

1643
03:12:21,541 --> 03:12:24,044
You! Why have you come here?!

1644
03:12:24,669 --> 03:12:27,172
To send your parents to India.

1645
03:12:29,674 --> 03:12:34,888
Who are you to send them?!
I'll send them whenever I want to!

1646
03:12:36,139 --> 03:12:39,684
For the sake of humanity,
it becomes my duty, Ranjit...

1647
03:12:40,310 --> 03:12:43,229
...to free them from the
clutches of your bondage!

1648
03:12:43,438 --> 03:12:47,817
They are my parents. I'll keep them
as I please! Why should you bother?!

1649
03:12:48,443 --> 03:12:50,945
It's no use arguing with you.

1650
03:12:51,738 --> 03:12:53,656
Aunt, pack your bags.

1651
03:12:53,948 --> 03:13:00,955
Don't you dare go with him!
- Or what?! What will you do?!

1652
03:13:01,790 --> 03:13:05,543
Kill me? Go ahead!

1653
03:13:05,960 --> 03:13:08,254
Kill your mother too!

1654
03:13:08,463 --> 03:13:14,094
Forget it! It's our fault for
having given birth to a son like him!

1655
03:13:14,302 --> 03:13:17,639
Let's go!
- Come with me, uncle.

1656
03:13:18,181 --> 03:13:23,269
You want to take them? Go ahead!
I'll see how you send them to India!

1657
03:13:23,478 --> 03:13:28,274
I have their passports. Who'll
give it to them? Your father?!

1658
03:13:30,568 --> 03:13:32,237
This father of yours will!

1659
03:13:50,588 --> 03:13:54,342
Wresting someone's passport,
is a crime.

1660
03:13:55,385 --> 03:13:59,139
Your second crime is that you
get illicit activities done here!

1661
03:13:59,556 --> 03:14:01,474
Hey! I'm a citizen of this country.

1662
03:14:01,599 --> 03:14:05,395
And you just can't come in and
arrest us, without any crime or rights.

1663
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:07,564
What are you doing? -
You are under arrest.

1664
03:14:08,815 --> 03:14:10,191
Shut up!

1665
03:14:11,234 --> 03:14:13,528
Thanks Rohan! Thanks
for the information.

1666
03:14:13,737 --> 03:14:17,490
Saw, Ranjeet!

1667
03:14:17,574 --> 03:14:21,244
A person who doesn't respect his
parents, gets no respect anywhere!

1668
03:14:23,538 --> 03:14:26,458
Mr. Patel, take them
to the police station.

1669
03:14:27,083 --> 03:14:29,586
I'll reach them to the Airport.

1670
03:14:29,669 --> 03:14:31,046
Ok guys, move!

1671
03:14:31,880 --> 03:14:34,382
Bless you.

1672
03:14:38,553 --> 03:14:41,056
Rohan hasn't yet come. Where is he?

1673
03:14:41,264 --> 03:14:44,809
He should have returned from
office by now. Even I'm worried.

1674
03:14:44,893 --> 03:14:49,606
Pooja is tired waiting for him. She
has to go back to Mr. Khanna's house.

1675
03:14:50,231 --> 03:14:54,402
Suppose Rohan does not come, then?
- Why do you talk like that?!

1676
03:14:54,819 --> 03:14:59,199
We'll phone his office.
- Perhaps, he won't be there either.

1677
03:15:00,867 --> 03:15:02,952
Then we'll phone Mr.
Khanna's residence!

1678
03:15:03,078 --> 03:15:05,580
It's not necessary
that we'll find him there.

1679
03:15:05,789 --> 03:15:07,749
We'll phone the police then!

1680
03:15:07,957 --> 03:15:11,920
What if the cops can't find him?
- Shut up, or I'll go away!

1681
03:15:12,128 --> 03:15:14,547
No, sit. I was only passing my time.

1682
03:15:15,048 --> 03:15:17,550
Were you passing your
time or wasting mine?!

1683
03:15:18,176 --> 03:15:20,887
What kind of a man are you!
You will never improve!

1684
03:15:21,096 --> 03:15:23,598
That's why I think I
should leave your house!

1685
03:15:23,807 --> 03:15:27,143
He's here!
- Where the hell were you?

1686
03:15:27,352 --> 03:15:30,689
Oh, you're here?
- We were worried sick!

1687
03:15:31,314 --> 03:15:33,817
Why are you shouting?

1688
03:15:33,900 --> 03:15:35,694
Any kind of problem?

1689
03:15:36,319 --> 03:15:38,822
I have bought gifts for all of you!

1690
03:15:41,324 --> 03:15:44,661
Give it! It's been so many
days since I received a gift.

1691
03:15:44,786 --> 03:15:48,832
Mr. Chaurasia, this
is for you... Open it!

1692
03:15:49,332 --> 03:15:50,750
Anything for me?

1693
03:15:50,917 --> 03:15:53,420
I've bought for everyone.

1694
03:15:55,922 --> 03:16:00,927
Tell me, did you like it?
- He hasn't got anything for us.

1695
03:16:01,344 --> 03:16:07,392
Can that ever be? Look,
what I've got for you... a TV!

1696
03:16:07,475 --> 03:16:11,354
Hey, he's bought a TV for me!
- And for me?

1697
03:16:11,563 --> 03:16:14,274
I've bought a TV for you too.
- Really?

1698
03:16:14,899 --> 03:16:16,985
Why do we need two TVs in one house?

1699
03:16:17,193 --> 03:16:20,530
Because whenever there will be
an India-Pakistan cricket match...

1700
03:16:20,613 --> 03:16:25,118
...you'll watch your own TV, and
henceforth, no TV will be smashed!

1701
03:16:25,326 --> 03:16:27,829
Fantastic!

1702
03:16:28,455 --> 03:16:33,877
You bought a gift for everybody,
but nothing for me, huh?

1703
03:16:34,919 --> 03:16:39,716
I've spent all my money. There's
no money left to buy you anything.

1704
03:16:40,759 --> 03:16:42,635
But...

1705
03:16:45,555 --> 03:16:48,058
...I've brought this flower.

1706
03:16:53,271 --> 03:16:58,693
Pooja, I'm very happy. I
got you, found a new job.

1707
03:16:59,110 --> 03:17:04,324
If mother hears this,
she will be ecstatic!

1708
03:17:08,703 --> 03:17:10,997
Rohan, how are you?

1709
03:17:11,289 --> 03:17:14,334
Fine. I have some good news!
- Shoot!

1710
03:17:14,542 --> 03:17:20,173
I've got a good job, and the one who
has given it to me is also an Indian.

1711
03:17:20,799 --> 03:17:25,178
He's a very nice person, mother.
- God bless him.

1712
03:17:26,429 --> 03:17:31,226
Thank him on my behalf.
- There's another good news.

1713
03:17:31,643 --> 03:17:34,354
How many good news
will you give in one day?

1714
03:17:34,979 --> 03:17:40,819
This is a good news that comes
once in a person's lifetime.

1715
03:17:41,027 --> 03:17:43,530
But remains forever.

1716
03:17:43,738 --> 03:17:46,866
I feel, you are in love!

1717
03:17:48,952 --> 03:17:50,829
Oh, mom! You are great!

1718
03:17:51,037 --> 03:17:53,957
Her name is Pooja. She
is a very nice girl.

1719
03:17:54,040 --> 03:17:57,293
I met her in New York
but she's totally Indian!

1720
03:17:57,711 --> 03:18:00,213
If you meet her, you
will be very thrilled.

1721
03:18:00,505 --> 03:18:02,716
In your joy, lies our happiness.

1722
03:18:02,799 --> 03:18:06,052
Where is grandpa? - At the shop.

1723
03:18:06,469 --> 03:18:10,849
Tell him about it, and convey
my regards. That's all, mother.

1724
03:18:11,099 --> 03:18:14,602
Take care, Rohan.
- You too, mother.

1725
03:18:26,072 --> 03:18:30,869
Had you been alive today,
you would have been so happy!

1726
03:18:31,411 --> 03:18:35,040
Your Rohan is happy, isn't he?
- He's very happy.

1727
03:18:35,248 --> 03:18:39,836
You've given him such a good job, and $5,000 in advance too.

1728
03:18:40,045 --> 03:18:42,339
What did he do with the money?

1729
03:18:42,547 --> 03:18:45,884
He spent all of it.
- What!

1730
03:18:46,926 --> 03:18:51,097
He spent all of it in
one day?! Does he gamble?

1731
03:18:51,514 --> 03:18:55,685
No! In Delhi, he has a neighbour
- Mr. Kapoor.

1732
03:18:56,102 --> 03:19:01,733
His son brought his wife and him
here, and made them slog like slaves!

1733
03:19:03,401 --> 03:19:05,904
Rohan sent them to Delhi today.

1734
03:19:06,529 --> 03:19:11,534
And yes! He sent $1,500
for his mother with them.

1735
03:19:16,331 --> 03:19:18,833
He is a very noble boy!

1736
03:19:19,668 --> 03:19:23,213
He was very adamant about meeting you.

1737
03:19:23,838 --> 03:19:28,009
I have invited him for the party
without seeking your permission.

1738
03:19:40,605 --> 03:19:43,066
Thank you.

1739
03:19:43,983 --> 03:19:51,783
This is not a new or unfamiliar
name for Indians residing in America.

1740
03:19:52,409 --> 03:19:58,248
All of us know that whenever there's
been a problem in India or here...

1741
03:19:58,456 --> 03:20:03,253
...Balraj Khanna has been the
first person to provide help.

1742
03:20:03,670 --> 03:20:10,135
He has earned people's respect
and good wishes more than money.

1743
03:20:12,303 --> 03:20:13,680
Even today...

1744
03:20:14,014 --> 03:20:19,102
...he has donated $500,000 to
the Indian Doctors' Forum.

1745
03:20:25,859 --> 03:20:29,529
Alright ladies and gentlemen.
Have a drink and enjoy yourself.

1746
03:20:54,137 --> 03:20:56,931
Pooja! - Hello, Ashwin uncle.
- How are you?

1747
03:20:57,057 --> 03:20:59,768
I'm fine. Uncle, he is Rohan.

1748
03:21:01,936 --> 03:21:04,397
I've met him.
- Yes.

1749
03:21:04,981 --> 03:21:08,318
Where is Uncle Balraj?
- Over there.

1750
03:21:28,338 --> 03:21:30,632
Pleasure to meet you, sir!

1751
03:21:54,823 --> 03:21:57,325
What's wrong?

1752
03:22:00,036 --> 03:22:01,705
Son.

1753
03:22:11,506 --> 03:22:14,634
You have no right to
address me as son.

1754
03:22:17,554 --> 03:22:20,265
Which duty of a
father have you fulfilled?

1755
03:22:21,933 --> 03:22:26,104
Despite having a husband, my mother
had to live the life of a widow.

1756
03:22:27,897 --> 03:22:30,692
And despite having a father,
I had to live like an orphan.

1757
03:22:30,984 --> 03:22:33,486
Say whatever you please.

1758
03:22:35,488 --> 03:22:39,242
But don't call yourself an orphan.
- I am an orphan.

1759
03:22:41,953 --> 03:22:44,456
Don't you dare call me son!

1760
03:22:46,541 --> 03:22:48,209
Forgive me.

1761
03:22:48,293 --> 03:22:51,129
Why should I forgive you?
Who are you?!

1762
03:22:52,380 --> 03:22:55,300
My father is dead;
you have killed him!

1763
03:22:56,968 --> 03:23:01,973
Despite being a criminal,
you live a luxurious life here!

1764
03:23:02,474 --> 03:23:04,934
Luxurious life?

1765
03:23:06,353 --> 03:23:09,272
I was a coward. That's
why I was avoiding you.

1766
03:23:11,775 --> 03:23:18,239
I want to tell the truth
before everyone today.

1767
03:23:22,619 --> 03:23:24,287
Excuse me!

1768
03:23:27,957 --> 03:23:29,501
May I have your attention please.

1769
03:23:32,629 --> 03:23:37,217
Balraj Khanna does not deserve the
respect all of you feel for him.

1770
03:23:39,511 --> 03:23:43,264
He is a culprit, a criminal.

1771
03:23:44,099 --> 03:23:46,810
I had a lovely family in India.

1772
03:23:48,061 --> 03:23:53,692
I was obsessed with making money.
I used to quarrel everyday.

1773
03:23:54,734 --> 03:23:57,028
One day, I fought and left.

1774
03:23:57,237 --> 03:24:00,990
I met with a bus accident.
However, I got saved.

1775
03:24:02,033 --> 03:24:05,161
I took advantage of it, and came here.

1776
03:24:05,787 --> 03:24:08,915
I am such a wretched, selfish man!

1777
03:24:14,129 --> 03:24:20,176
22 years ago, I had killed myself.

1778
03:24:21,845 --> 03:24:28,727
And today, I'll
terminate this dead body!

1779
03:24:29,769 --> 03:24:32,272
Come to your senses, Balraj!

1780
03:24:32,480 --> 03:24:35,817
My friend, I don't wish to live.

1781
03:24:40,405 --> 03:24:42,907
I don't wish to live.

1782
03:24:46,453 --> 03:24:50,415
A son lights his
father's funeral pyre.

1783
03:24:55,420 --> 03:25:03,762
Kill me, son. I'll assume that
you have conducted my last rites.

1784
03:25:06,890 --> 03:25:11,061
By killing you, my mother is
not going to regain her youth!

1785
03:25:12,520 --> 03:25:15,648
My childhood cannot be retrieved!

1786
03:25:17,942 --> 03:25:21,279
Do you think I'll forgive you
because you confessed before everyone?

1787
03:25:23,782 --> 03:25:27,118
Your second wife and
her son have left you.

1788
03:25:27,243 --> 03:25:30,663
So, you feel love for
my mother and me now?!

1789
03:25:31,706 --> 03:25:35,460
Didn't you think about us before?!
- You're wrong.

1790
03:25:39,005 --> 03:25:43,176
After coming here,
Balraj realised his mistake.

1791
03:25:44,844 --> 03:25:47,347
He had even returned to India.

1792
03:25:49,015 --> 03:25:53,186
Yes, Rohan. When I went to Azamgadh...

1793
03:25:55,063 --> 03:25:58,817
...father had sold his shop
and house, and gone somewhere.

1794
03:26:00,485 --> 03:26:04,447
I searched high and low,
but I could not trace him.

1795
03:26:07,575 --> 03:26:12,997
I remarried because... I
wanted to settle here.

1796
03:26:13,832 --> 03:26:17,794
Son, even you were going
to do what I already had.

1797
03:26:20,088 --> 03:26:27,804
But you are fortunate that you
were destined for a girl like Pooja...

1798
03:26:28,847 --> 03:26:31,766
...who opened your
eyes at the right time.

1799
03:26:33,852 --> 03:26:39,691
Forget everything, and answer
from the bottom of your heart.

1800
03:26:41,151 --> 03:26:45,113
Aren't you glad that
your father is alive?

1801
03:26:49,075 --> 03:26:52,620
A child can be raised in an orphanage.

1802
03:26:54,914 --> 03:26:57,834
If a father dies, then he
can live because of his mother.

1803
03:27:00,754 --> 03:27:03,673
But if a wife loses her husband...

1804
03:27:05,550 --> 03:27:12,432
...then I know the
difficulties she faces in life.

1805
03:27:12,891 --> 03:27:18,688
Because I have seen the doleful
face of my mother, her Ioneliness!

1806
03:27:21,816 --> 03:27:25,779
You are my mother's
culprit before mine!

1807
03:27:28,490 --> 03:27:31,409
And only my mother has
the right to forgive you!

1808
03:27:31,826 --> 03:27:36,414
Please let me talk to Rama just once.

1809
03:27:39,334 --> 03:27:41,211
I...

1810
03:27:43,088 --> 03:27:45,590
I implore you!

1811
03:27:47,676 --> 03:27:50,178
Let me seek her forgiveness.

1812
03:27:52,681 --> 03:27:56,226
I know that seeking her forgiveness
is not going to wash my sins but...

1813
03:27:58,937 --> 03:28:01,439
...I'll be relieved of a burden.

1814
03:28:04,109 --> 03:28:06,194
Hello! - Mother!

1815
03:28:06,277 --> 03:28:09,114
Rohan! So early in the morning?!

1816
03:28:09,531 --> 03:28:14,744
Dawn has broken there, but
there's still darkness here.

1817
03:28:15,161 --> 03:28:17,872
What's it?
- Tell me something, mother.

1818
03:28:19,749 --> 03:28:25,380
Suppose you suddenly learn that
father is alive, what will you do?

1819
03:28:26,631 --> 03:28:30,176
W... what are you saying?!

1820
03:28:32,262 --> 03:28:33,930
He's alive.

1821
03:28:37,976 --> 03:28:40,478
Speak to him.

1822
03:28:55,201 --> 03:28:56,453
It's me.

1823
03:29:06,671 --> 03:29:08,340
Forgive me.

1824
03:29:11,885 --> 03:29:15,221
I touch your feet and say, forgive me!

1825
03:29:24,272 --> 03:29:25,648
Yes, Rama.

1826
03:29:33,573 --> 03:29:41,289
Come... come home.

1827
03:29:49,631 --> 03:29:53,802
What is she saying! Speak to her!

1828
03:29:56,721 --> 03:30:04,646
Mother, what do I do?
- Bring him here.

1829
03:30:12,654 --> 03:30:17,992
Did you hear? Pooja,
my Rama has forgiven me!

1830
03:30:18,201 --> 03:30:21,121
She said, come back.

1831
03:30:22,163 --> 03:30:28,003
Rohan, quit this urge to make money!

1832
03:30:28,420 --> 03:30:35,093
Look at me! I have paid
such a heavy price for that!

1833
03:30:35,927 --> 03:30:40,306
I say, let's go back!

1834
03:30:40,390 --> 03:30:42,892
Go wherever you want to!

1835
03:30:43,435 --> 03:30:45,937
But transfer all
your inheritance to me!

1836
03:30:47,188 --> 03:30:51,359
You have not only cheated his mother
and him but also me and my mother!

1837
03:30:51,776 --> 03:30:55,947
You hid from us about
your wife and son in India!

1838
03:30:56,156 --> 03:31:00,118
And now that you have found your son,
you give him all your love!

1839
03:31:00,952 --> 03:31:04,497
All right! Go wherever
you want, with your son!

1840
03:31:05,540 --> 03:31:09,711
But you will have to
transfer all your property to me!

1841
03:31:20,555 --> 03:31:25,352
Impertinent boy! I
will not give you a penny!

1842
03:31:25,977 --> 03:31:28,063
I'll see how you don't give!

1843
03:31:28,271 --> 03:31:30,982
What will you do?!
- Anything!

1844
03:31:31,191 --> 03:31:33,902
You threaten your father,
you insolent boy!

1845
03:31:43,286 --> 03:31:46,414
Don't you dare raise
your hand on my father!

1846
03:32:26,037 --> 03:32:29,791
You raise your hand on your
father for the sake of money?!

1847
03:32:31,042 --> 03:32:34,587
Let alone wealth, I won't
even give you my name now!

1848
03:32:35,630 --> 03:32:40,010
I disown you in front of everybody!
You are not my child!

1849
03:32:40,427 --> 03:32:45,223
Don't do that. After all,
he is my brother.

1850
03:32:46,891 --> 03:32:49,394
Please forgive him.

1851
03:32:51,896 --> 03:32:54,399
He doesn't deserve to be condoned.

1852
03:32:54,607 --> 03:33:00,655
Even you didn't deserve to be
forgiven. But mother did forgive you.

1853
03:33:09,205 --> 03:33:14,419
Be grateful to Rohan,
because of whom I am forgiving you.

1854
03:33:16,087 --> 03:33:21,509
I'll give you so much money that you
won't have any problem all your life.

1855
03:33:22,552 --> 03:33:27,557
You will only have
wealth now, but no father!

1856
03:33:28,808 --> 03:33:31,936
Because I am going to India for good.

1857
03:33:42,572 --> 03:33:46,534
I am very grateful to you for...
- No, Mr. Balraj!

1858
03:33:47,160 --> 03:33:52,999
You gave refuge to my son. I
am extremely grateful to you.

1859
03:33:53,083 --> 03:33:56,961
What are you saying, Mr.
Balraj? This was our duty.

1860
03:33:57,587 --> 03:34:04,052
Wear this amulet. This will
protect you in the journey.

1861
03:34:05,720 --> 03:34:07,597
Do remember your brother.

1862
03:34:07,806 --> 03:34:11,559
We are also coming!
- Hurry! The flight will take off!

1863
03:34:11,768 --> 03:34:14,062
Let's bid a final goodbye.
- Yes.

1864
03:34:14,145 --> 03:34:16,648
Where are both of you going?

1865
03:34:16,815 --> 03:34:19,067
To our country.
- Suddenly?

1866
03:34:19,275 --> 03:34:23,446
I had given a
policeman a ' paan' to eat.

1867
03:34:23,655 --> 03:34:25,740
The limestone in it scalded his mouth.

1868
03:34:25,824 --> 03:34:28,868
And he slapped a $200,000 case against us.

1869
03:34:29,077 --> 03:34:32,205
All the money which I earned in
18 years has gone down the drain!

1870
03:34:32,414 --> 03:34:35,542
I say, what's the use of
living in such a country?!

1871
03:34:35,750 --> 03:34:39,921
A little extra limestone, and
your lifetime earnings are gone!

1872
03:34:40,130 --> 03:34:43,258
The flight announcement
has been made! Let's go!

1873
03:34:44,926 --> 03:34:48,054
Shall I tell you something,
Rohan? Don't be offended.

1874
03:34:48,680 --> 03:34:51,808
It's not very easy to
make money in America.

1875
03:34:52,225 --> 03:34:57,856
Your father could mint money,
but you could not.

1876
03:34:58,273 --> 03:35:00,775
Who says that I have gained no wealth?

1877
03:35:03,695 --> 03:35:06,406
I'm taking my father
back for my mother.

1878
03:35:07,449 --> 03:35:09,951
Can there be any
wealth greater than that?

1879
03:35:10,368 --> 03:35:15,373
Yes, son... Come, let's return now.

1880
03:35:31,431 --> 03:35:36,436
What has he done now?
- What you can't even imagine!

1881
03:35:37,270 --> 03:35:41,232
He has had a drug dealer like
Marco and his gang arrested.

1882
03:35:41,441 --> 03:35:43,943
So, even the law has condoned him.

1883
03:35:45,278 --> 03:35:50,825
I don't want any wealth; I
want my father. Take me along too.

1884
03:36:30,448 --> 03:36:32,117
Book Karan's ticket.
