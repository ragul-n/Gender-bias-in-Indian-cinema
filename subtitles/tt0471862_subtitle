1
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:12,542
This film is based on a real incident
which took place many years before

2
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:17,709
lndian traditions should flourish

3
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,249
Classical dance isn't all about
moving legs and hands

4
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,090
lf you don't concentrate the gesture
will become laughable! Understand?

5
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:06,795
Speak out!

6
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,931
She is a small child, leave it

7
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:12,332
There is a big responsibility
on this small child in the future

8
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,269
Dance!

9
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,445
Dad scolds me daily like this

10
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,139
l won't learn the dance

11
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,614
l won't learn mom

12
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,119
You are my darling.
Don't cry

13
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,621
Don't cry like that!
-Come dear

14
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,631
You don't want to learn dance, isn't it?

15
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:46,135
Ok, l will take you to a new..

16
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,636
..place which you never seen
Will you come?

17
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,639
Where? l won't tell
but l will show you

18
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,141
l too come with you, dad

19
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,973
Do we go without Chandrakala?
You are also coming.

20
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,653
Carefully. Go slowly

21
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,377
Pournami, come here

22
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,715
What dad?

23
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,051
Listen what is heard from this pillar

24
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,397
Omkaram(Sacred intone)is heard
What is this?

25
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,907
This is not an ordinary temple

26
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,077
This is a sacred place
in which Goddess Parvathi Devi..

27
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,246
..danced here to delight Lord Shiva!

28
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,606
Come here dear
Carefully

29
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,754
Your mom gave performance here

30
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,583
My mother, her mother
and their grandmother..

31
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:49,751
..like this our ancestors
performed here for 450 years

32
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,763
450 years!
Yes dear.

33
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,425
There was severe droughts
before 450 years in this place

34
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,765
People wanted to leave
and migrate from this place

35
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,440
Our family women were confined
in the house but a woman came out then. . .

36
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,614
. . .brought out the dance among people
which was confined to the prayer room. . .

37
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:14,447
. . .she invocated
Goddess Parvathi in her in this podium. . .

38
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,112
..and performed dance
for 7 days and 7 nights!

39
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:34,966
People from surrounding villages
who were leaving the place...

40
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,974
..came and awed by her dancing who was
unselfishly dancing for the people

41
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,636
People held camphor fire on their palm. . .

42
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,977
..intoned 'Hara hara
Mahadeva Sambo Sankara'

43
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,653
..and prayed day and night!

44
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,500
She lost her life. . .

45
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,939
. . .by dancing in this podium

46
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:18,677
Lord Shiva showed kindness for
her sacrifice and Ganga who is on

47
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,183
..his head, turned into rain and
made the barren land into cultivable

48
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,852
Even if it rains heavily..

49
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,025
..the torch which was fired by her is..

50
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,693
..will burn continuously!

51
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,031
While dying she asked a promise
from us that a woman from our family. . .

52
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:42,071
. . .must dance on Pushkara Pournami
(carnival) which falls once in 12 years

53
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:52,207
lt became habitual and. . .

54
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,216
. . .it is a boon for our heredity

55
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,887
Pushkara Pournami
will be held after 10 years

56
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:03,392
You have to dance here on that day!

57
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:19,108
The great soul of embodying!

58
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:23,279
The beautiful tune of life!

59
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,517
The ever new persistent rhythms!

60
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,414
Are roots of the whole world!

61
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,261

AFTER 10 YEARS..

65
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,356
Pushkara Pournami(carnival)
is falling in 8 months

66
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,697
You taught dance to
your daughter Pournami since 10 years

67
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,372
But that girl. . .

68
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,537
Why are you hesitating?

69
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,875
His elder daughter has
eloped with someone

70
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,047
How can be the dance
performed on that day? Ask him

71
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,225
Be quiet. You are an elder,
how can you talk like that?

72
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,892
lf you pained with my words
don't do religious rituals..

73
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,721
..don't open the doors of the temple

74
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,726
Don't give Aarathi(camphor fire)

75
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,727
Don't offer Naivedyam(Sacred food)

76
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,231
Likewise don't fast on
Shivarathri day in Srisailam

77
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,232
Don't arrange
Brahmothsavams in Tirumala temple

78
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,405
Don't arrange Uthsavams
on Vijayadasami to Kanakadurga

79
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,732
No, it's disgrace

80
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:02,737
l am telling you

81
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,570
lf we don't perform
it is also a disgrace

82
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,746
He is worrying because
his daughter eloped

83
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,414
But if anything happens. . .

84
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,584
. . .we too should worry like him
Wait l will tell you

85
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,086
Though he was harsh
but he told the truth

86
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,088
We can look after other works

87
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,091
But the dance is
your family's responsibility

88
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,298
Do one thing,
teach dancing to your....

89
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,932
. . .second daughter Chandrakala

90
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,428
l won't teach

91
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,935
What can l do if you talk adamantly

92
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,768
Your daughter
She won't learn dance

93
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,012
Shall we marry?

94
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,654
Catch her

95
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,499
No, don't near me

96
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,006
l am telling you, don't near me

97
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:50,115
Don't near me
What if l do?

98
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,352
Escape man

99
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:43,064
Aunty, that is. . ..l lost vegetables. . ..

100
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,397
..oils and the things

101
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,401
l did a mistake aunt
Leave that.

102
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,073
What about this?

103
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,745
Your anklet

104
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,744
Only one is here
Where is another one?

105
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,411
l don't know aunty
l didn't see

106
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,747
Didn't you see?
Tell me the truth

107
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,424
Will you tell me the truth or not?
-Why are you beating like that?

108
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,183
Your hands will be pained
Beat with this stick

109
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:13,093
Enough. People are disgracing
me because l am a step mother

110
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,267
But nobody knows what you does

111
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,436
Why are you troubling me?

112
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,605
You too elope with
someone like your sister

113
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,936
How dare you stare at me?

114
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,112
Will you get angery
if l talk about your sister?

115
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,110
Don't talk about my sister

116
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:33,615
What did you say?
You talk too much

117
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,117
Mom, it is here.

118
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,783
l got this anklet under your cot

119
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,122
Come here

120
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,802
The anklet was under my cot, that means. . .

121
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,301
..you haven't cleaned
my room since morning

122
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,637
Go and clean my room
-Sister! -You come here

123
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:01,973
You are expert in searching
reasons to beat her

124
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,825
Pournami, how are you?

125
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,660
What are you doing?

126
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,166
lts as usual for me
Getting scolded and beaten

127
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,496
l don't care about me
but she scolded you

128
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,171
l got angry

129
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,010
l too want to go somewhere

130
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:36,511
But dad will remain alone
-Sister!

131
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,217
You didn't eat anything

132
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,855
l brought some sweets which mom hid

133
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:48,356
Eat this sister.
Eat it for my sake. Only one

134
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,859
l can't sleep without eating extra food

135
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,199
lt became excess to me

136
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,373
-Uncle! -lf l tell your matter
to your mom she will scold you

137
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,378
l say, leave me

138
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,570
l married second time
because to look after the family

139
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,731
But l didn't expect then. . .

140
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,904
. . .that l was erring

141
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,574
But for that wrong doing

142
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,076
You are also being punished

143
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,251
l can't control your step mother.

144
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,950
Pardon me
-Dad

145
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,418
We have trust in Lord Shiva.

146
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,754
He will show us a way!

147
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,117
Where and how is your goal!

148
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,324
Move on without a thought!

149
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,865
Don't be wary saying Oh my God...

150
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,999
...don't stop with a weakened soul!

151
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,403
Take all jobs as song and play!

152
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,735
Achieve whatever it may be!

153
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,134
Among hillocks and shallows...

154
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,538
...whatever comes against us

155
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,976
Be it sunshine or streaming rain

156
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,075
Our speed won't change a bit!

157
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,821
To reach our dream palace!

158
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,157
Fight is the only royal way!

159
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,005
Saying pain and sourness...

160
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,378
...don't look for an excuse!

161
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,781
Feeling life is grievous...

162
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,017
...don't stop at every step!

163
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,625
Tomorrow means a sweet Honey comb...

164
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:19,120
...though sharp spines are all around it!

165
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,494
Devuni Patnam
2 Miles

166
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,830
Slow! What a speed!

167
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,836
Mr Priest, where is
Mr Subramaniam's house?

168
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,675
l am fine!

169
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,435
l think you are new to this place

170
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,670
What have l asked and
what are you telling?

171
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,678
l want Mr.Subramaniam's house

172
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,010
l've come to rent their
eastern part of the house

173
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:17,177
This is not Shiva temple
but Anjaneya swami's

174
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,686
Come after l complete
my religious rituals..

175
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,189
..l will give you 'Prasadam' (sacred dish)

176
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,690
He is annoying!

321
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,216

The other day he spoiled my motif

00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:12,412
Yesterday he made me show
my teeth and treated like a monkey

326
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,253
No way. l should think something. . .

327

00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,247
One who have snake
around the neck is 'Shiva'

340
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,707
One who have flute
in the hand is 'Sri Krishna'

341
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,248

l became wife of 60 year
old man at the age of 16

345

l couldn't find a male who can
fulfill my wishes till l saw you

346
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:02,728
Don't say no.

347
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,865
See Mohini, undesired lust is
like living with a corpse!

348
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,596
Both are the same.

349

-Not that. -Go away.

350
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,641

Are you here!
Ok, see well!

353

Then you won't have
nose, ear to wear ornaments. . .

354
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,989
..no feet to wear anklets, no eyes
to see your beauty!

355
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,651
Tell me what is the matter
-Land lord has come from London.

356
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,153
Sister!

357
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,431
What shall we do now?

358
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,894
Damn it! lt's like the pan
complaining with the stove

359
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,231
lts ok for you. You can
survive begging at any temple steps!

360
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,432
What about me!
l wont be here. l will go.

361
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,607
Landlord has called, isn't it?

362
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,445
You go. l will come behind

363
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:34,053
He has asked to bring
both of us, isn't it?

364
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,115
Why are you seeing like that? Let's go

365
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,001
l am Ankappa talking. l am alright.

366
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,175
l am alright. Our Landlord
has come from London.

367
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,678
l've to talk with low voice like this
You also talk with a low voice.

368
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,714
Did you ask, what he is doing?
At present he is. . .

369
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:06,385
. . ..playing music

370
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,338
We came to pay a visit to you, sir.

371
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,453
l have to bring something to your notice. . .

372
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,364
Pournami. . .

373
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,460
Pournami has eloped.

374
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:44,754
l am the god. That's why. . .

375
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:50,653
..that lady dancing before the idol
Siva must dance before me first. . .

376
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,254
. . .and spend 3 nights with me. . .

377
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,923
. . .l got that strange desire in me.

378
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,325
l have informed you.

379
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,197
You came before l got into the ship
You said Pournami will be mine.

380
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,731
l gave seven sets of ornaments to you

381
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,802
When l got down from the ship,
you say that she has eloped.

382
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,175
Pournami hasn't eloped but she escaped

383
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,184
Now, what l have to do?

384
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,622
Ok, what you have to do?

385
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,224
Sister, the ornaments around your
neck appear to me as hanging ropes!

386
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,508
These are the ornaments
you gave me for Pournami.

387
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,903
l couldn't bring her to
you as per agreement. . .

388
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,544
. . .so l am handing over the
ornaments to you again. . .

389
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,874
. . .l am not saying like that, sir.

390
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:51,254
Until now l believed this fool
He couldn't bring her.

391
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:56,389
Now l'll sell these jewels and
get her by searching the whole country

392
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,058
l will get Pournami and
throw at your feet.

393
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,556
Permit us to leave, sir.

394
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:08,563
Fine, l am leaving you because of
your cleverness and timely thought.

395
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,941
Show this cleverness in bringing Pournami.

396
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,004
Then you can live. Go

397
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:22,411
Your kind heart is like a
big sea that's why you've pardoned them

398
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,916
l am not boasting. lt is true.

399
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:26,955
Then how will be the boasting?

400
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,924
You are really the Lord Vishnu. You're
resting on the snake bed in the milk sea. . .

401
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,594
. . .but l am pressing your legs
instead of Goddess Lakshmi!

402
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,358
l am a blessed one.
Not a blessed one!

403
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,116
l want to talk an
important matter with you

404
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,457
Boss, she is there.

405
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,970
l forgot the whole thing.
l pardoned you. Leave me.

406
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,005
Then at least drink the
sugarcane juice with me.

407
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,473
Then l am really pardoned

408
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:29,415
Ok.

409
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,160
Have it.

410
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,165
Damn her!

411
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,563
Where do you escape?

412
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,312
Don't bother about them.
You first drink.

413
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,018
Please drink it

414
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:03,682
Drink it

415
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,351
Hold this.

416
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:15,293
Have you seen? Though you
came forward, l haven't backed up.

417
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,201
That means, l don't fear you.

418
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,064
Boss, were you scared?

419
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,040
He kept his hand in the pocket
l was just wondering. . .

420
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:33,016
Marbles
-Marbles, boss.

421
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,355
Something has happened.

422
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,158
Did you hit me?

423
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:47,886
Yes boss. He hit you.

424
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,726
Trouble is over
At least, drink now

425
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,634
Glass is there
Where is the juice?

426
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,068
l drank it.

427
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,074
What is this?
Both of them fell each side!

428
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,001
Be a palanquin and...

429
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,330
...bear my weight!

430
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:39,933
Be the feet and...

431
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:43,843
...make me tread!

432
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:49,519
l need this and that
Only you must give

433
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:53,019
Like a soaring bird
l must fly in the air!

434
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,882
Must jump and play
On the blue sky l must...

435
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,687
...see the starry world!

436
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,362
Please take me there!

437
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,355
Let us go there, move!

438
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:08,868
Let us go there, move!

439
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,672
A frightening dream!

440
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,542
Or a sculptor, you are!

441
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:50,003
A twirling tide
or a funny joist you are!

442
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:51,909
A net craftily set or you...

443
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,915
,,a chill in mid summer!

444
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,750
Don't know who you are!

445
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,419
And why befriended me!

446
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:01,147
You won't leave me alone!

447
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,822
Ok, my lord, let us go!

448
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,558
After slyly waking me up!

449
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,593
This, that or in anyway!

450
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,897
We must be speeding on!

451
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,171
ln the speeding waterfalls!

452
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,040
With glittering water play!

453
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:28,909
With lot of fanfare must...

454
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,510
...Bind my ringing ankle bells...

455
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,512
...with the songs of parrots!!

456
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,380
ln first game of touch and go

457
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,351
Accompanied by laughter...

458
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,020
...l should frolic with ecstasy!

459
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:41,682
ln the flooding speedy waters...

460
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,391
...there can't be rhyme and time!

461
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:49,056
With the playful young ones!

462
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,696
The sky and earth must only...

463
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,702
...just swing and dance!

464
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,393
Be a palanquin!

465
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,347
lt is dawn
Aunt may scold me.

466
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,712
l found a good alliance for Chandrakala.

467
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:19,988
We need not give a single paisa as dowry

468
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,322
They will bear the marriage expenses.

469
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,124
His name is Kanaka Rao
Place is Vadareyi

470
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,257
lts 10 years since he lost his wife.

471
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:36,864
Stop there. By next month
10th he completes 60yrs.

472
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,475
He doesn't like to
celebrate it without a wife

473
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,678
That's why, he wants to get married soon

474
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,240
Kantham, do you want to get
her marry a 60 year old man?

475
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,812
lt is atrocious
-Yes, it is.

476
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,212
You married me as a second wife

477
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,817
How can you apply
different yard stick for your daughter!

478
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,484
That is immaterial
l won't agree to this alliance

479
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,326
-l don't mind even if she
doesn't get marry. --Let it be so

480
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,688
You've uttered it yourself

481
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:06,760
Ok, let her not marry
Teach her dancing

482
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:12,501
Are you surprised
about my sudden thought?

483
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:16,178
The reason is, the tenant boy has
written the letter to your daughter

484
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:20,110
lt doesn't occurred to me
till l saw this. Read it.

485
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,715
Chandrakala, dance is
running in your nerves

486
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,787
You've danced superbly without learning

487
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,117
lf a teacher like your father thinks,. . .

488
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,852
. . .he can make you a great dancer

489
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,927
Listen my words.
Learn the dancing

490
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,700
Seems dance is
running in your daughter's nerves

491
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,064
Why not she dance before
Raja instead of him?

492
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,139
She wont.

493
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,200
l won't teach dancing to Chandrakala.

494
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,707
You won't teach dance or
get her married, then what will you do?

495
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:49,873
Will you do business with her?

496
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,256
Solution is not in his hands
but in your actions

497
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,200
Who are you?
What do you know?

498
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:48,330
Do you think everything is
ok if you write on a paper?

499
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:49,935
Do you think you saved us?

500
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,609
Or do you think unless you say
we don't know that dance is in our blood!

501
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,944
Why do you keep mum
after knowing everything?

502
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:57,542
Not because l can't do it.

503
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,612
Because l know what happens
if Chandrakala learns dancing

504
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,611
What will happen?
-Everything will be destroyed.

505
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,619
Chandrakala's life will be
spoiled at the hands of that landlord

506
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,613
The dance which ought to be
performed before the Lord Shiva. . .

507
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:09,149
. . .has to be performed before that scoundrel

508
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,288
Our girl shouldn't dance
before anybody except Lord Shiva

509
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,829
That's why l wanted to avoid that

510
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,036
My daughter learned dance
with 10 years hard work

511
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,370
l wanted her to live
with dignity wherever she is!

512
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,633
l had sent her!

513
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,407
l know.

514
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:38,476
What did you say?
-l know it.

515
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:43,822
Who are you?

516
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,705
Chandrakala will learn dancing

517
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,881
Ask her to say it.

518
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,286
You are my darling!

519
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,884
Why do you bother, give me l will tie.

520
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:28,262
-Tell that Kanaka Rao to
search for another match. -Ok, sister.

521
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:30,925
You like pudding, right?
Wait l will bring it

522
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,094
My darling!

523
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,042
Dad, you only refused it

524
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:46,515
And now you want me to dance
What is all this?

525
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,376
l used to tell that Lord
Siva will show a way

526
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,177
Now he has showed a way.

527
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,779
-But.. -You will understand
when time comes.

528
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:55,954
Dad!

529
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,903
The great soul of embodying!

530
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:23,143
The beautiful tune of life!

531
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:27,221
The ever new persistent rhythms!

532
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:31,655
Are roots of the whole world!

533
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,949
Sir, she will be dancing
before the god in the temple.

534
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:41,753
l want her.

535
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:47,228
lf you don't ask for Pournami,
then l will arrange this girl.

536
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:00,442
Why are you reading at the doorsteps?
You can read in the house.

537
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:03,577
Dad, nobody is in the house.
So, l got scared. -Scared?

538
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,648
Why fear?
What happened to sister?

539
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,146
For some pledge, mother took her
to Poleramma(village goddess) temple

540
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,148
Pledge? That too in a no moon day!

541
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:19,056
Wear this sari
- No, aunt. l will go home

542
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,992
Damn it! Catch her.

543
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,329
Leave me.

544
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,736
How dare you? Prepare her.

545
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,500
Chandrakala, stop. Catch her.

546
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:34,405
Catch her.

547
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,903
What will you get by dancing
before Shiva in the temple?

548
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,065
Except some share in the offerings.

549
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,477
You dance before me.
This palace will become yours.

550
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:49,815
Dance!

551
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:53,552
Dance!

552
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:56,254
Start dance.

553
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,425
Why did you stop? Play on.

554
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:06,765
Start play

555
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:41,398
l came to take Chandrakala.
l will take her, like a male.

556
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:46,069
lf you have guts and if your dad's
blood flowing in you, then come alone

557
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,639
lf you cant. . ..

558
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,475
Chandrakala is my life's ambition.

559
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:30,880
lf you try to touch even her shadow,
you're a lady, l don't hesitate to thrash

560
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:14,520
lts nice if we give and take
Give me your heart!

561
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,262
Give it, give it!

562
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:21,860
lts ok if both get united,
Give me your beauty!

563
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,203
Give it, give it!

564
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:29,368
Best time not needed
for enjoying pleasures

565
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:34,271
Advance, move forward
Why don't cross the limits!

566
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,343
Boy must request for a kiss!

567
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,754
Girl must refuse demurely!

568
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:43,554
Why do you change roles
Oh, dear damsel!

569
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:31,100
Oh! My dear king!
