1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,500
"What is the nature of life?"

2
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:59,042
"Where's life headed in this
mighty creation?"

3
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:06,375
"What's the nature of life?
What's right, and what's wrong?"

4
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,167
"Is this the karma of my previous life?
The Lord tends to ignore my existence"

5
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,542
"What's the nature of life?"

6
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:34,250
"The Universe is only but God's dream"

7
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:43,083
"I take the form of a fetus
and embark on the dreadul journey of life"

8
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:48,417
"Waiting in the darkness
For my birth"

9
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:55,875
"I come out of the womb
with hands folded"

10
00:01:55,958 --> 00:02:01,333
"I feel the rush to be born after 9 months."

11
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,917
"What is the nature of life?"

12
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:10,333
"Where's life headed in this
mighty creation?"

13
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,917
"Surviving hell in the womb..."

14
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,500
"Surviving hell in the womb..."

15
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,042
"I desired to stand chivalrous"

16
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,458
"But as various
diseases take over me"

17
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,083
"Chivalry doesn't stand a chance"

18
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:38,125
"That childhood knows no greed"

19
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:43,833
"But renunciation wishes
for fruitful pleasures"

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,792
"Who would come rescue
me from this illusion?"

21
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,042
"A peaceful world becomes a rare sight"

22
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:04,583
"A peaceful world becomes a rare
sight when chaos prevails"

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,583
Hey Raju, are you going to work?

24
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,208
Yeah.

25
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,083
Look at your cheeks!
You look adorable.

26
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,792
So you've started early in the morning.
- Obviously!

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,875
Is it fish curry?
- Yes, fish fry.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,292
Add lots of spices to it.
It'll taste really good!

29
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,208
Ahoy! Brothers and sisters
of the village!

30
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,875
As part of the Clean India programme...

31
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,292
we request everyone to participate in it.

32
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:41,000
"I marry an angelic
beauty out of desire"

33
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:47,417
"Hopes about children
come with imaginations"

34
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:51,000
"Where is this life headed?"

35
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,333
Hey! Wait up.

36
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,625
Hey, man.

37
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,583
Where are you going?
- Office, brother.

38
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you walking?
- My cycle's tyre got punctured.

39
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,083
I gave it to Ghantasala to fix it.

40
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,958
I'm getting late,
I'll see you later.

41
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:06,875
That's all right. But...

42
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,958
My generator business is
running on losses these days.

43
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,208
Please let me know if anyone
in your office needs us.

44
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,042
Sure, man. I'll let you know.

45
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:13,792
Hey...
- Yes?

46
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,500
Can you drop me near the bus stop?

47
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,917
What?
- Drop me at the bus stop.

48
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,125
There's no need of all that.

49
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,708
Walk all the way. It'll at least
help with your hangover.

50
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,792
I'll teach you a lesson tonight.
-Yeah, right. Go.

51
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:36,000
"No one would ever accompany
us till the very end"

52
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:39,583
"What is the nature of this life?"

53
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:45,000
"Where's life headed in this
magical creation?"

54
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:52,750
"Hail, Lord Balaji!"

55
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,125
Sir, you look fit today.

56
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,667
Is it noticeable?
-Of course.

57
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,542
I'm using a powder called Herba Life.

58
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,542
I'm drinking 2 glasses every day.

59
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,375
I've lost 2 kilos in the last week.

60
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:05,500
So you're a Complan Boy from now on.

61
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,958
No. I'm a Herba boy.

62
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,667
Sir, the three of you look dapper today.

63
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,875
The woman who has been transferred
from Orissa is joining here today.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,042
That's why the three of us are dressed up.

65
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,042
Oh... I completely forgot!

66
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,875
The manager asked me
to get her a bouquet...

67
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,333
Mom, I'm going to school.

68
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,458
Hey, he kid is leaving without
eating anything.

69
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:44,042
Yeah, I didn't eat anything.

70
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,000
Today's the first day of school.
They asked us to be there early.

71
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:54,208
Okay, I'll eat something.

72
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,625
Koti is waiting for me.

73
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,458
I guess they left already.

74
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:27,750
No, they wouldn't have. Girls take
all the time in the world to dress up.

75
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:28,833
Are you sure?

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,375
Yes, I am. Give me those Rs. 2
that your dad gave you.

77
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,250
Here you go.

78
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:35,917
Two bananas please.

79
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,167
Sundaram, let's have some bananas.

80
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,708
You can have mine as well.
- That's lovely.

81
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,125
They are here!

82
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:33,792
Why do you think they didn't greet us?
- Haven't you gotten used to this yet?

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,375
Girls only talk to smart guys.
Not with dopes like us.

84
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,250
You didn't even let me finish the bananas.

85
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,375
Isn't this what you waited for all summer?
Now go talk to her.

86
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,875
Not now. The floor is slippery.
- I know what to do. Hey, Sunitha..

87
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,458
Don't shout!
Please don't shout.

88
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:55,167
I won't shout if you promise to give me
another Rs. 2 tomorrow.

89
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,625
Yes, I promise.
- Alright. Let's follow them now.

90
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,167
Yes, sir.
Hey, Anil!

91
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:30,417
Yes, sir.
I-I can handle that.

92
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,083
I'll take care of it.

93
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,542
Yes, I hear you, sir.
I'll take care of it.

94
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,167
I'll take care of it.
Sure, sir.

95
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,167
Boss says someone hurled abuses at him
during yesterday's rally.

96
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:56,000
He put the blame entirely on us
for letting this happen.

97
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,417
Who was that guy anyway?

98
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,500
That guy's name is Seenu.
He lives in our village.

99
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,333
Just like the way we keep
some men on pay roll

100
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,375
Seenu is on the pay roll
of the opposition party.

101
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:10,625
Whatever. Ask Joseph and his friends
to care of him.

102
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,875
Sure, boss.
- Hey, hold on.

103
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,042
Yes, boss?
- Don't let Joseph know

104
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,625
that he's doing it for the minister.
- Sure, boss.

105
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,875
If he gets to know, he'll start believing
that he is in the big league.

106
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:23,417
Such a foolish belief
made me what I'm today.

107
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,625
Whatever you say, boss.
- Go now.

108
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,250
How long you've been waiting here, dad?
- Only for a while.

109
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,250
I'm in a rush.
So, hop on.

110
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,542
Are you all set?
- Yes, I am.

111
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,792
Look at those goons rough up a man.
Please stop the vehicle, dad.

112
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,833
Why do you care
what those idiots are up to?

113
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,875
Don't you jerks
have any shame?

114
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,792
Three of you
have rounded up one guy.

115
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:58,500
Come back now.
- Hold on, dad.

116
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,542
Why don't you guys go find
some job?

117
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,542
You worthless rascals!
- Let's go, my child.

118
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:07,833
Come on, move it, you idiots!
Get out of here!

119
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,125
Guys like you are the reason why
our country remains backward.

120
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,125
Get out of here!

121
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,583
Good morning, ma'am
- Good morning

122
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,833
I'm Raju.
I'm an attendant.

123
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,542
It slipped my mind
that you'd be coming here.

124
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,958
That's why I couldn't get you
the bouquet on time.

125
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:33,708
The manager even yelled at me.
Please accept this bouquet.

126
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:42,500
I'm sorry I didn't get your name.
- I'm sorry. I can't follow Telugu.

127
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,792
I see! You only speak Hindi, perhaps.
- Not exactly. I'm from Orrisa.

128
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,917
My mother tongue is Oriya.
But I can also speak Hindi.

129
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,083
I can follow Hindi a little.

130
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,083
I've learnt it from Muslims
who live in my village.

131
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,042
I didn't follow.
- Never mind.

132
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,000
Please sign here.

133
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:10,208
Ma'am, if you need anything,
just call my name.

134
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,917
I'll be at your service.
- Sure.

135
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,208
Sir, collect money from him.

136
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,875
Gaddam, how much should he pay?
- He needs to pay Rs. 20.

137
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,458
All those who made their purchase,
please vacate the counter.

138
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:44,708
Get me a quarter of DSP, please.
- I guess we are out of stock.

139
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:46,042
Look down there.

140
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,917
Sir, where is the carton of DSP?
- It'll be somewhere there.

141
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,583
Hey, Gaddam.
- Yes, sir?

142
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:00,875
That girl is here.

143
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,583
Hey, get this man a quarter
from this carton.

144
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,708
Sir, I'm taking a quarter of Mansion House.
- That's fine.

145
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,458
I'll be back soon.
- Better hurry up.

146
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,875
Ma'am, 10 more rupees please.

147
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,208
Starting today,
alcohol prices have gone up.

148
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:48,917
That's settled.

149
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,083
Get back to your work!

150
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,542
All have set their eyes
on her.

151
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,083
Gaddam, did you talk to her
atleast today?

152
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,833
Yes. I did.
- Is it?

153
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,250
I told her that alcohol prices
have gone up.

154
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,458
By talk to her, I mean
did you confess your love for her?

155
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,792
How could I? I go weak in my knees
the moment I see her.

156
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,833
Bro, give me the keys.

157
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,208
This won't do.
Confess to her as soon as possible.

158
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:33,000
Only then we'd know
what's on her mind.

159
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,708
Even I want to confess to her.

160
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,667
But, I don't see her anywhere else
but near the liquor store.

161
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:43,333
Four muslim guys asked me the other day
if I knew where she stays at.

162
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:44,750
I told them
I had no clue.

163
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,500
See, you've already got competition.

164
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:50,292
Those guys are in no way my competitors.
My love for her is genuine.

165
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,458
Your love being genuine won't do.
You first have to tell her about it.

166
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,917
Of course, I'll tell her.

167
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:56,083
He's back.

168
00:14:58,542 --> 00:14:59,458
I'll leave now.

169
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,250
Hey Gaddam, hold on.
- What is it?

170
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,500
You keep walking.
- Talk to him. I'll be here.

171
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,208
Just go. - Don't push me around.
- Keep walking.

172
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,417
You're upto something fishy, I know.
- Move it.

173
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,125
My friend and I
are planning to bring in a hooker

174
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,708
after we shut shop tomorrow.

175
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:19,875
We can use your place for it, right?

176
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,500
You can join the fun for free.

177
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:28,417
I was wondering why you were
backing me today like never before.

178
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,625
Now I know why.

179
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:33,792
Alright, get her. But keep it short,
unlike the last time.

180
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,917
I'll get into trouble
if the landlord finds out.

181
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,542
Sure, we'll keep it short.

182
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,708
Alright. See you tomorrow.
- Alright. Bye.

183
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:49,458
"The dimpled beauty blushes
as I wink at her."

184
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:55,958
"The dimpled beauty blushes
as I wink at her."

185
00:15:56,542 --> 00:16:02,667
"She looks at me from corner of her eyes
and then smiles."

186
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:09,000
"She shies away
when I make any advances."

187
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:15,083
"She comes by in a Tata
and then bids me ta-ta."

188
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:21,500
"She comes by in a Tata
and then bids me ta-ta."

189
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:26,667
"She walks around the town
with that beautiful gait.."

190
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,208
Hey, Veera Babu,
get me tea.

191
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,583
Had you been married,
your wife would've served you tea everyday.

192
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:50,333
I'll marry the day I find someone
who makes good tea like you do.

193
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,042
You come up
with ridiculous excuses every time.

194
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,917
Every villager, but you,
wants to see you get married.

195
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,042
I don't care what you say.
Get back to work now.

196
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,875
Neither do I care
about your wedding.

197
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,375
Hey, Raju.
- Good morning, bro.

198
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,375
Good morning.

199
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,708
Is your manhood still intact?

200
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,750
I haven't used my manhood in a while.

201
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,625
I'll put it to use tonight
and I'll let you know tomorrow.

202
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:22,208
If you don't get married,
and put it to use

203
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,917
you'll have to bid farewell
to your manhood.

204
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,458
This fool has no better topic
to talk about.

205
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:29,958
He speaks as if he is brimming
with virility.

206
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,583
These rascals
have followed me till here.

207
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,833
I'll teach them a lesson.

208
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,750
Cousin Santosh..

209
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,708
You scoundrels..
- Don't you dare..

210
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,125
How dare you stalk me!

211
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,208
Beat them to pulp.

212
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,625
Teach them a lesson
they'll never forget.

213
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:45,958
This guy deserves this the most.
He held my hair.

214
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,750
Don't let them run away.

215
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,125
Don't you dare
come this way ever again.

216
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:07,917
Good morning, Ma'am.
- Good morning. Please sit.

217
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:10,417
Thank you, Ma'am.

218
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:13,333
She is Usharani,
the newly appointed Maths teacher.

219
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:16,833
Hereon, she'll be your class teacher.
Am I clear?

220
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,917
Yes, ma'am.
- You may start the class.

221
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,042
Hey, you,
sit properly.

222
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,792
Miss, my Math book.

223
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,250
So soon?
-Won't you teach us today?

224
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,167
Today's my first day, right?
So let's get to know each other first.

225
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:34,958
Okay, miss.

226
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,792
My name is Usharani.

227
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,292
My favorite colour is black.

228
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,333
I like playing badminton.

229
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:49,500
Now introduce yourselves with your name,
favorite color, and hobbies.

230
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,708
Shall we start with you?

231
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,917
My name is Venu.

232
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,792
My favourite colour is orange.

233
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,250
I like skipping.

234
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,375
If I give you an idea to impress
Sunitha, will you give me 2 rupees?

235
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,625
What is it?

236
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:09,375
When it's your turn say the same things
as her. She'll fall for you.

237
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,708
Are you sure?

238
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,083
Do as I say!

239
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:16,125
My name is Indira.
Purple is my favorite colour.

240
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,417
I like dancing.

241
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:25,292
My name is Sunitha, miss.

242
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:29,750
My favourite color is pink, miss.

243
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:33,917
I like listening to songs, miss.

244
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:36,583
Which song do you like
the most?

245
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:41,917
'A Wonderful Man' is my
favorite song, miss.

246
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,083
That's my favorite song, too.

247
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,167
Will you sing that song
for me?

248
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,250
I can't sing, miss-

249
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,167
Sing whatever you know.
Come.

250
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,583
Kids, clap for Sunitha.
She's going to sing for you.

251
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,250
Sing.

252
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,875
"What a wonderful man you are
You are mine, and only mine."

253
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:16,583
"I'll always be your slave
I'm yours, and only yours."

254
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:19,458
Why did you stop?

255
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,625
I don't know the lyrics, miss.

256
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,708
You shouldn't stop
it if you love it.

257
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,167
Next time, I want you
to sing the entire song.

258
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,125
Okay? Go sit.

259
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,125
Miss, my name is..

260
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,000
It never works out
for this unfortunate fool.

261
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:39,542
I'll listen to the rest tomorrow.
We're done for today..

262
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,375
You still owe me two rupees!

263
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:46,458
So, Mr. Janakiram,
won't madam join us?

264
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:47,875
How would I know?

265
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:52,125
Right.
You know nothing.

266
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,792
He knows everything, sir

267
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,333
Hi!
- Hi. - Hello.

268
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,375
Can I sit here?
- Please.

269
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,417
Please sit.
You're welcome here.

270
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:11,625
Ma'am, do you like it here?
- I love it here.

271
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,458
Your name is..?
- I'm Janakiram

272
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,083
I see. Yours?
- Myself Koteswar Rao, madam.

273
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,667
I remember your name.
Manohar, isn't it?

274
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,708
Even my brother's name is Manohar.
That's why I remember it.

275
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,625
That's such a coincidence

276
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,625
that both mine
and your brother's names are Manohar.

277
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,500
But I have no sisters.

278
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:48,125
[ Raju humming a song ]

279
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:56,875
What's up Raju, you seem jubilant?
- I received my salary today, sir.

280
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,917
Mr Raju, why sit there?
Sit with us.

281
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:06,167
Ma'am, he's only an attendant.
That is his place.

282
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,208
What if he is an attendant?
I won't tolerate this classism.

283
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:13,125
Mr Raju, come and sit next to me.
- Never mind, ma'am.

284
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,875
This has been my place for past 10 years.
I don't mind sitting here.

285
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,750
I don't care.
Please come and sit here.

286
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,875
Raju, you heard her.

287
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,042
Come, sit here.

288
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:32,875
Ma'am, tell us
about yourself?

289
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,125
Like what's your hometown
and what does your husband do?

290
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,417
I am from Rourkela.
- I see.

291
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,750
And my husband is no more.

292
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,625
What did she say
her husband does, sir?

293
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,292
She says he passed away.

294
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,417
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

295
00:23:56,292 --> 00:24:00,500
I have a daughter.
She is a smart girl.

296
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,667
That's nice.
What's her name?

297
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,875
Aditi.
- That's a lovely name.

298
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,167
Where are you staying at now?

299
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,375
Near by,
in Gavara Kancharapalem.

300
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,208
Gavara Kancharapalem!
That's my neighbouring village.

301
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:17,500
Cut the crap, Raju.

302
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,250
Where does your daughter stay?
- At my brother's house.

303
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,292
She's been staying there
since the death of her father.

304
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:27,125
She grew up there.

305
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,417
So, how many children do you have?
- I've got two sons.

306
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,458
They go to school.
- That's nice.

307
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,667
What about you?
- Me?

308
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,083
I've a daughter.
Six years old.

309
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,375
And you, sir?
- I've got 4 kids.

310
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,292
Four kids?
That's nice.

311
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:49,000
Mr Raju, how many do you have?

312
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:53,750
He isn't even married yet.

313
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,875
I want the idol to be flawless.

314
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,792
It should be as good as real.

315
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,792
Don't worry, sir.

316
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,917
Rammurthy here
is a master craftsman.

317
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,417
His idols are as good as they can get.

318
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:18,208
Who doesn't know about Rammurthy?
He used to work for Diwakaram, right?

319
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,875
Now that he quit there,
Diwakaram's idols look so flat and mundane.

320
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:24,500
Since Rammurthy works for you,
I've come here this time.

321
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,917
I'll leave now.
See you later, Rammurthy.

322
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,958
That idol at the corner is mine.

323
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,417
I want you to make it
even better.

324
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,167
I know what you mean.

325
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,708
You'll take the whole day to say it.
So cut it.

326
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:46,250
How was it?

327
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:51,667
It's your turn now.
- It's late already. Send her away.

328
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:53,917
Get in.
Why waste money?

329
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:01,208
Hurry up. I've got another client
waiting for me.

330
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:02,792
Sit for 10 minutes.
Then you can leave.

331
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,542
What do you mean sit?
Won't you sleep with me?

332
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:06,958
I don't want to.

333
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:09,292
My friends would chide me
if we leave already.

334
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,958
So, we'll wait for 10 minutes
and then leave.

335
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,250
The deal was for three guys, right?

336
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,292
That's right, but..

337
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,250
Then come do me.
- I don't want to.

338
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:24,000
Why? You got some problem?
I've got pills if you want.

339
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,250
What! It's not that I got some problem.
- What then?

340
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,875
Well, I'm in love with a girl.

341
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:34,375
How can I cheat on her?

342
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:37,458
What nonsense!
Cut the crap and do me now.

343
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,000
You don't seem to understand me.

344
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:45,500
Say, if that girl cheats on me,
will I tolerate it? No, right?

345
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,125
That's why even I won't cheat on her.

346
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:56,875
Who is the girl
that you are so much in love with?

347
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,500
I work at a liquor store.

348
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,875
Daily she comes and buys
a bottle of Mansion House.

349
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,875
This has been going on
for a year now.

350
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,458
Is she prettier than me?

351
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:19,375
I don't know
- You don't know?

352
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,958
She always wears a scarf.

353
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,625
You haven't even seen her face,
yet you love her?

354
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,292
I haven't seen her face
but I've seen her eyes!

355
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:32,125
They are no ordinary eyes.
They melt my heart.

356
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,292
You fell in love
because of her eyes?

357
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,083
Did you at least tell her?

358
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,625
I lose my breath when she's around.
Forget about me confessing to her.

359
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,542
Even frauds who only want to bed girls

360
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,333
express their love
and then cheat them.

361
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,167
How could a genuine lover like you
not confess his love?

362
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:56,542
Do you booze?
- Yes, I do.

363
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,167
Down two pegs for courage.
Then go tell her.

364
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,625
Jump! Jump! Jump!

365
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,292
Stop blabbering, will you?

366
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,792
If not play with us
and teach us how to jump.

367
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:21,167
I shouldn't be jumping at this age.
It'd be hazardous.

368
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:24,167
Raju, you're 49 years old
and still unmarried.

369
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,750
Why do you care about jumping?
Go and mind your own business.

370
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:34,792
Every bastard
talks about me being unmarried.

371
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,125
Hey, Raju!
- What?

372
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:46,042
The astrologer said I'll live
to see the next year.

373
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,625
I wish to see you get married by then.

374
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:52,333
Is it? Then let's get married.
You still have a year left, right?

375
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,667
Bear me a child.
That'd keep the entire village off my back.

376
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:59,083
I'm too old for that.
- Then you better shut it and go home.

377
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:01,792
Everyone in this village
is bothered about my marriage.

378
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:20,208
What's up?
Why did you call me here?

379
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,250
What's the matter?

380
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,000
Why are you crying?

381
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,167
There is a guy named
Ashok in our college.

382
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,125
Since the first day of college,
he's been making advances towards me.

383
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:36,792
Is it?
Why didn't you ever tell me?

384
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,208
Hear me out first.
- Alright. Continue.

385
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,750
It was all harmless
in the beginning.

386
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,000
He used to write me letters everyday.

387
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:47,375
But one day, I told him
I wasn't interested in him.

388
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,000
Since then, he's been torturing me.

389
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,750
He's spreading malicious rumours
about me.

390
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:02,875
The other day, he asked me
if I'd sleep with him.

391
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:04,875
Control yourself.

392
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,125
Complain to the college principal
about him.

393
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,125
He is the principal's son.

394
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,375
I fear he'll hurt me
if I complain about him.

395
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:20,250
Maybe I should tell my parents about this.
Perhaps they'll do something.

396
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,125
Alright. Go running to your parents
like a worthless coward.

397
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:28,333
If you tell your parents,
they'll first drag you to the temple

398
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,875
and will make you pray to Goddess

399
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,625
to teach that jerk a lesson.

400
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,375
Do you really think
mere prayers would help?

401
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,125
What do we do now?

402
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,625
Continue working out
for six more months.

403
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,667
You'll get into great shape
like our boss.

404
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,000
If you don't
you'll end up like me.

405
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:02,250
Put the weights down
and relax.

406
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,625
May I help you?
- Is Mr. Ammoru here?

407
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,250
Who are you, ma'am?

408
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,875
My name is Bhargavi.
I've come to meet Mr. Ammoru.

409
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:15,208
Bhargavi?
Well..

410
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,500
Are you from Madhavadhaara?
- Yes, I am.

411
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,750
Boss has just left!
Please sit..

412
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:25,458
Please go in and sit.
I'll go get him. Please be seated.

413
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,625
Don't they look great?

414
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,625
Yes, they do.
They look better than movie stars.

415
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:46,292
How do you know Ammoru?
- That's a long story.

416
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,292
Tell me.
- The night before intermediate exams..

417
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,375
The night before physics exam
to be precise.

418
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,625
My parents left me home
and went to attend a funeral.

419
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,875
I was at home studying.

420
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,375
All of a sudden Ammoru barged in
and shut the doors.

421
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,125
I was very scared.

422
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,500
He requested me to let him stay
as some goons were after his life.

423
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,000
He was profusely bleeding.

424
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,000
I took pity on him
and let him stay.

425
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:15,875
A while later, the goons left.
Ammoru too was about to leave

426
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,500
when he told me his name

427
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,500
and that everyone in Kancharapalem
knows him by name.

428
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,750
He asked me to seek his help
whenever needed.

429
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:29,417
Now that you have a problem,
here we are.

430
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,625
How are you, Mr. Ammoru?

431
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:39,875
Bhargavi!

432
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,875
There is nothing to worry about.

433
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,125
My men will take care of him.

434
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,375
I'll ensure that he never looks you
in the eye.

435
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,000
Won't you deal with him personally?

436
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:06,875
I'm set to contest
in the muncipal elections.

437
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:10,292
It's not wise
that I get involved in trivial matters.

438
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,667
Don't worry.
Like I said, my men will take care.

439
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,375
Is that alright?
- Alright.

440
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,000
Boss, you wanted to meet me?
- Yes, Joseph.

441
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,625
How are you?
- I am great, boss.

442
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,250
You are here too?
- You are here too?

443
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,042
Why is she here, boss?
- Is he the one who'll deal with that guy?

444
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,875
Why?
Do you know each other already?

445
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,500
I've been itching
to get even with her.

446
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,500
I'm right here.
I dare you to get even!

447
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,625
I got these guys beaten to pulp
near my place.

448
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,667
You got us beaten
because it was your neighbourhood.

449
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:43,125
Now you've come
into our neighbourhood.

450
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,833
I'll see to it
that you don't walk out alive.

451
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:48,000
Hey, what's happening?
What's the matter?

452
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,708
Don't you dare misbehave with her.
Apologize to her.

453
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,250
But, sir, this girl got me..
- Cut it.

454
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:56,625
I don't care what happened
between you both.

455
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:00,708
I'm sure she'd do no wrong.
It has to be your fault. Now apologize.

456
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,625
But, sir..
- Apologize to her.

457
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,958
I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

458
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,000
Sit now.

459
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:14,875
Anil told you what to do, right?
- Yes. He told us.

460
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,792
These girls will take you
to that scoundrel.

461
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:21,375
After you deal with him,
ask Anil to pay you Rs. 500.

462
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,375
Sure, sir.
- You girls may leave now.

463
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,125
They will take care of him.

464
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,500
If this guy misbehaves, inform me.
I will take care of him.

465
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,250
Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

466
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,083
Thank you, Mr. Ammoru.

467
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:38,333
Don't be so formal, my child.
Call me uncle.

468
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:39,750
Thank you, uncle.

469
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,500
What are you staring at?
Let's go.

470
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,583
Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

471
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,042
What did you say?
- I said thanks.

472
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:45,125
Hey!
She's now thanking us.

473
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,000
The other day, when we thrashed
that guy you abused us.

474
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:52,250
But today you're thanking us
for beating up this guy?

475
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:57,292
Well, you ganged up on one guy.
I-I couldn't watch that sight. So..

476
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:01,667
Not to forget,
she also got us thrashed by her people.

477
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:06,625
You all were stalking me, weren't you?
That's why I got you thrashed.

478
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,292
Anyways, I'm sorry for that.

479
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,042
And I'm thankful
for helping us today.

480
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,958
A mere thanks won't do
for the help we did.

481
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,542
You didn't help us out for nothing.

482
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,292
You're being paid Rs. 500 by Ammoru
for helping us.

483
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,542
Do you think we are hired goons?

484
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:28,125
He is a large hearted man.
He pays us everytime we meet him.

485
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:34,375
Alright then. Why don't we meet
this sunday and have a party of sorts.

486
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,792
What! You girls booze?
- I'm not talking about a booze party.

487
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,542
What then?
- We can meet at the bakers'

488
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:45,667
and have some soft drinks
and pastries.

489
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,542
Alright. Any party with girls
sounds fun.

490
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,292
Around 10AM this sunday

491
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:57,667
we'll meet near the laundry shop
near Madhavamurali school.

492
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,083
Is that fine?
- Accept the invitation.

493
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,833
Alright, fine.
- See you this sunday. Bye.

494
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,792
Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

495
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:14,042
Raju, ever since she arrived here,
you've been moving around like you're an officer

496
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,875
and having lunch
with us officers.

497
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,625
You want me to sit somewhere else?
- She won't like it. You better sit here.

498
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,208
What?
- It was just an inside joke.

499
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:28,167
He's been cracking jokes lately.

500
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,500
Madam, since you're new to this office,
I brought you a gift.

501
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,375
Here is a sweet
popular in my hometown. Have some.

502
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:47,125
I don't eat sweets.
I've got diabetes.

503
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,750
What? You're diabetic?
How old are you?

504
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:56,042
Shut up, Raju.
You've got no manners.

505
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,958
You shouldn't ask women their age.
- Hold on a minute, sir.

506
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:02,750
Tell me, ma'am.
How old are you?

507
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:07,750
I'm 42.
- Is it? Look how strong I am.

508
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm 49.
I walk, I jog, I do yoga.

509
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:14,875
Neither do I have diabetes,
nor do I have BP.

510
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,875
You too must start jogging.
- You are right. Even I should.

511
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:22,750
For the past 15 years
I never had the time for it.

512
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:25,375
Now that you told me,
I will definitely start jogging.

513
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,750
That's nice.

514
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,375
Didn't I tell you that we'll talk later?
Get back to work now.

515
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,500
Hey, Subbi, come here.

516
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:00,542
Read this for me.

517
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:08,792
'For the past one year,
you've been saying the same.'

518
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,167
'My salary is still the same.'

519
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,250
'You are enjoying the fruits
of my hard work.'

520
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,000
Are you jealous
that my business is doing well?

521
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,375
Do you think
you are indispensable?

522
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,750
There are loads of guys
who are ready to work for me.

523
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,250
'Why don't you hire
someone else, then?'

524
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:39,125
'Without me, your business
would go downhill like that of Diwakaram's.'

525
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,542
Don't you dare
talk to me like that?

526
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,917
Son of a bitch! How dare you lay
your filthy hands on me?!

527
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:52,500
Sir, please stop!

528
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:56,750
Get out, you bastard!

529
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:59,167
You want to quit, is it?
Too bad, you're fired.

530
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,792
Now go and beg on the streets.

531
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:12,500
'I don't have to beg.'

532
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,500
'I can set up my own business
in this village'

533
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,750
'and make more money
than you will, this season.'

534
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,750
'Then, you'll have to beg
on the streets.'

535
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,917
Oh my god!
He said it!

536
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:23,250
Go ahead!
Set up your own shop.

537
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:26,250
Let's see who has the last laugh.

538
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:28,625
Running a business isn't as easy
as making idols.

539
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,000
Get lost, you son of a bitch!

540
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:39,459
You want to write something?

541
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,959
Do you really think
business is a good idea?

542
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:28,209
Hmm!

543
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:32,209
They're all shrewd businessmen
who've been doing business for so long.

544
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:36,334
You can't even talk properly.
Will anyone come to us to buy idols?

545
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:39,334
I-If I make...

546
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:42,959
Hush! You'll wake the child.

547
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:47,625
Are you saying that your idols are famous
and hence everybody will buy them?

548
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:48,417
Hmm.

549
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:50,959
You're right. But...

550
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:54,584
Isn't there a saying about
considering the cons before the pros?

551
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:56,959
Will you listen to my advice?

552
00:42:58,334 --> 00:42:58,792
Hmm.

553
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:01,667
Since you've stopped working
for Ankal Rao...

554
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,584
Diwakaram must be ecstatic
with this piece of news.

555
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:07,417
Diwakaram makes 500 idols every year.

556
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:09,834
Go strike a deal with him
for 100 idols.

557
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:13,875
Who will turn down someone
as good as you?

558
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:16,167
You can quote the price you want.

559
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:20,959
Investing on those 100 idols
won't be a gamble.

560
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:37,042
Had your drink?

561
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:37,542
Yeah.

562
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,667
Your girl's here, dude!

563
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:41,792
Already?
- Yeah!

564
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:43,584
Look! She is standing on the
other side of the road.

565
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:44,667
Go, man!

566
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,542
You want to go empty-handed?

567
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,042
Good that you asked.
- Give her something nice.

568
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:54,042
But I don't know what she likes.

569
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:55,500
I've got an idea.

570
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:58,542
Gift her a bottle of her
favorite brandy.

571
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:01,042
Move!

572
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:03,667
Sir...

573
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,167
I can see that your chick's here.

574
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:10,417
I'm taking a bottle of Mansion House.

575
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:13,125
Don't forget the money.

576
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:39,417
Hey!

577
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:42,042
Are you stalking me?

578
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:43,542
No, ma'am...

579
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,667
I have to tell you something.

580
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:47,542
What is it?

581
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:51,709
I've been seeing you for an year, ma'am.
And I like you a lot.

582
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:53,792
What do you mean?

583
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,042
I mean... I really like you.

584
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:59,667
But I'm not like the others.
I am a good guy.

585
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:03,292
I can see what a nice guy you are.
You're drunk, aren't you?

586
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:06,125
Please don't think that way.

587
00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:10,417
I only had a little to
look confident.

588
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:14,667
You also drink, right? That
doesn't make you a bad person.

589
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:16,917
Forget about all this.

590
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,042
If you're fine with it,
I would like to marry you.

591
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:24,917
There are hundreds like you
who follow me.

592
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,042
Should I marry all of them?

593
00:46:27,292 --> 00:46:28,917
I don't care about them.

594
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:34,917
But if you marry me,
you'll know paradise.

595
00:46:39,292 --> 00:46:42,042
Ma'am! Say something
before you leave.

596
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,667
You just told me, right?
Let me think about it.

597
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,667
Wait a minute.

598
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,042
What is it?

599
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,792
May I know your name?

600
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,292
Saleema.

601
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:58,167
Are you muslim!?
Nice to know, ma'am.

602
00:46:59,542 --> 00:47:01,042
Ma'am!

603
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:04,167
What is it now?

604
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:07,792
May I see your face just once?

605
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:47,417
Oh! Orissa ma'am.

606
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:51,042
Hello, ma'am!

607
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:52,792
Mr. Raju...

608
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:54,542
Good morning, ma'am.

609
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:55,792
Good morning, Mr. Raju.

610
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:57,292
Do you also jog here?

611
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:59,542
Yes, yes. How come you're here?

612
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:02,542
I told you yesterday that
I live in Gavara Kancharapalem, right?

613
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,417
Oh yeah!

614
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:08,292
You said that I should start jogging.
So I started today.

615
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:09,667
Very good!

616
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,417
Come! Let's jog together.

617
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:16,667
Ma'am...

618
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,542
You should do it like this.

619
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,042
Like this?

620
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:23,917
Yes. Walk like this.

621
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:54,292
I get what you're saying, Murthy.

622
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:56,792
I am not making 500 idols like I used to.

623
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:59,167
I'm making somewhere between
200 and 250 idols.

624
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:02,042
Out of that if I give you
a contract of 100 idols...

625
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:03,667
it won't be feasible for me.

626
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:08,417
Okay. Since you came
to me all by yourself,

627
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:11,542
I will let go of my selfishness
and get you a contract.

628
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:15,042
You don't have to make 100 idols.
I just want you to make one.

629
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:18,167
Whatever profit Ankal Rao
makes for the whole season...

630
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,042
You can make that
much by making one idol.

631
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:22,917
How, master?

632
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:24,042
I'll tell you how.

633
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:29,084
They are planning to install a 30-foot idol
in our Kancharapalem ground.

634
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:31,542
Only yesterday the organizers
came to speak with me.

635
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:34,292
But, they won't give you a
single penny in advance.

636
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:37,542
Since it's a huge idol...

637
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:39,042
They are a little cautious.

638
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:42,834
They will sign an agreement saying that
they'll pay you as soon as the work is done.

639
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:45,042
Moreover, you have the
money required to invest.

640
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:48,417
If you like the deal I'll get you
the contract right now.

641
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:54,917
I.. w-will ask my wife..
and let you know, master.

642
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:50,667
Why are you following me again
after running away yesterday?

643
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:54,667
After such a huge shock,
what else could I have done?

644
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:56,542
If it was someone else,
they wouldn't have come back.

645
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:59,417
What made you change your mind?

646
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:01,542
I thought about it the whole night.

647
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,792
I've decided that I will marry
no one but you.

648
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:08,042
Did you even see my face properly?

649
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,959
Of course I did!

650
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:12,542
Please stop doing these things.

651
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,917
I will marry you and take
good care of you.

652
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:16,667
Marriage?

653
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:18,417
What do you even think of yourself?

654
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:22,292
Do you think you're a hero to
rescue me from the life I've chosen?

655
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:23,542
Get out of here!

656
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,792
Go find yourself a girl
and get married.

657
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,667
I don't care what you think.

658
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,250
Who decides what's good
and what's bad anyway?

659
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:31,917
I'll do whatever feels right to me!

660
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:32,917
Bullshit!

661
00:51:33,042 --> 00:51:35,667
You saw my face yesterday,
and today you want to marry me.

662
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:37,167
It's not about the face!
Those eyes...

663
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:39,292
I fell in love with those eyes!

664
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:42,792
You saw these same eyes
the other night.

665
00:51:42,792 --> 00:51:46,167
But you didn't recognize them because
they belonged to a prostitute.

666
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:47,667
Fell in love with my eyes, my foot!

667
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:51,042
Go tell your stories
to someone else.

668
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:54,042
There's a reason
I didn't recognize you.

669
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:56,667
But you knew all along that
I was talking about you.

670
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,667
Why did you tell me to
express my feelings to the girl...

671
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:01,417
and that my love was genuine?

672
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:03,042
What do you have to
say about this?

673
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:18,417
Lots of men have asked me
to sleep with them...

674
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:27,042
But no one ever said that
they loved me.

675
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:30,792
I wanted to see
what it felt like.

676
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:33,417
This is what it feels like.

677
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:35,917
It feels good.

678
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:38,542
I know. I'm good at everything.

679
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,459
Now...will you marry me?

680
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:44,167
Since you're so persistent,
let's do something.

681
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:46,167
I need to be able to trust you.

682
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,542
Let's get to know each other
for a few days.

683
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:52,042
The day I start trusting you is
the day I will ask you to marry me.

684
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,542
Until then don't ask me to
stop working.

685
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:56,084
Why do you want to do that again?

686
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:59,417
How will I know that you won't start
reminding me of my past...

687
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:02,542
once you've had enough of me?

688
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:07,042
If you don't like it, leave!
No questions asked.

689
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:15,042
What else can I say?
Have it your way.

690
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:17,167
Then I have a few conditions.

691
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:20,167
I stand at the Convent Circle
every day for business.

692
00:53:20,417 --> 00:53:22,417
And I want you to drop me
there every day.

693
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:23,167
Me?

694
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:25,167
Yeah.

695
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:28,042
And about your friends
who sought my services...

696
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:31,334
I want you to tell them
that you love me.

697
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,042
Is it necessary?

698
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:34,167
Yes.

699
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:36,417
If you can't even tell them that
you love me...

700
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:39,042
how will I know that
you'll marry me?

701
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:41,167
Okay. Understood. Next?

702
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:44,667
I have a few wishes
that I want you to fulfill.

703
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:45,667
What are they?

704
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:49,292
I want to eat at a fancy restaurant
and you should pay the bill.

705
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:54,542
I want to watch a film in a movie theater
without a care in the world.

706
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:55,209
Next?

707
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:59,667
If I tell you everything right now,
I'll scare you off. Now go home.

708
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:04,167
Come back at 6PM tomorrow
so that you can drop me.

709
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:07,292
Okay then. I'll see you tomorrow.

710
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:08,667
Bye.

711
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:13,042
I totally forgot!

712
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:14,917
Hey, Saleema!

713
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:17,167
What is it?

714
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,417
There's something that
I need to tell you.

715
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:25,792
I love you.

716
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:32,292
A friend told me that I should
gift you something while proposing.

717
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,292
You drink Mansion House, don't you?

718
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:37,542
That's why I got you this.

719
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:44,292
Hey, Rammurthy...

720
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:46,417
This document says that
you won't ask for money

721
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:49,042
if you don't deliver the idol
before the festival.

722
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:51,792
Tell him that we won't pay him
if the idol isn't perfect.

723
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:53,917
I'm telling them the same.

724
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,667
Sign on it confidently.
We'll take care of it.

725
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:04,042
He is asking for a pen.

726
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,292
Here. I've got it.

727
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:20,792
Okay. You can start work tomorrow.

728
00:55:21,042 --> 00:55:22,417
The idol should be great, man!

729
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:24,542
The old woman won't spare
any of us otherwise.

730
00:55:26,292 --> 00:55:27,667
Wait, I'll tell them.

731
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:31,167
He is saying that the idol will
surely blow your minds!

732
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:34,042
Oh really? Let's see
what he's really capable of.

733
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:36,167
Look how supportive
his wife is!

734
00:55:59,042 --> 00:56:00,917
Dad, I want this shirt.

735
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:03,792
I-It isn't good.

736
00:56:04,042 --> 00:56:06,292
It is good! I want this shirt.

737
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:10,917
G-Girls wear t-that color.

738
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:14,042
This is my favourite colour, dad.
I don't want any other shirt.

739
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,167
It won't look good!

740
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,292
If you won't buy this shirt,
I don't want any other.

741
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:20,042
Hey!

742
00:56:31,084 --> 00:56:32,042
Raju...

743
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:35,042
Tomorrow I want to visit the
Simhachalam temple.

744
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:36,667
Simhachalam? You want the address?

745
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:40,584
No. Shall we go to Simhachalam together?

746
00:56:40,709 --> 00:56:41,209
Me?

747
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:44,167
Okay, I'll take you there.

748
00:56:44,459 --> 00:56:47,209
It'll take us 30 minutes
if we board Bus number 28.

749
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:49,959
I don't want to take the bus.
I want to go there on foot.

750
00:56:50,459 --> 00:56:53,792
Money? It's the end of the month, ma'am.
I don't have any to lend you.

751
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:57,417
Not money. I want to go on foot.
Walking!

752
00:56:57,834 --> 00:56:59,667
Oh, like a foot pilgrimage?

753
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,959
In that case there is a shortcut
through Madhavadhara hill.

754
00:57:03,084 --> 00:57:05,792
I will take you there. You
don't worry about it.

755
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:08,709
It's just that we will have to
start early in the morning.

756
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:09,584
What?

757
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:11,292
It's nothing.

758
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:13,459
Morning 6 o' clock...
Going, going.

759
00:57:15,459 --> 00:57:16,167
Okay!

760
00:57:37,709 --> 00:57:39,459
Seek blessings from the lord.

761
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:54,959
Pray to the lord to fulfill
your heart's desires.

762
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:58,334
My husband is doing his own business
for the first time, lord.

763
00:57:58,584 --> 00:58:01,084
Let there be no obstacles on his way.

764
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:03,542
Oh Lord, I got into this business
to preserve my self-respect.

765
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:06,959
Don't let any harm befall my family.

766
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:11,584
Lord, Sunita doesn't talk to
me no matter how hard I try.

767
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:14,459
Please see to it that she
speaks with me.

768
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:18,084
Don't wish for too many things!
The Lord might run away.

769
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:39,709
Why're you wearing this shirt, man?
Everybody's laughing at you.

770
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:42,084
Sunitha likes the color pink.
That's why I wore this.

771
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:45,834
Pathetic! It's embarrassing to even sit
with you. I'll go sit somewhere else.

772
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:55,209
Hurry up! I am hungry.

773
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:05,292
Why did you come back?
- Look over there.

774
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:12,667
Hey Sundaram! Why are you
wearing pink like a girl?

775
00:59:13,042 --> 00:59:14,667
Why are you troubling him?

776
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:18,584
Sundaram, your shirt looks great!
Pink is my favorite color.

777
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:24,292
Hey Sunitha. There was a ceremony
at our house today. Have some sweets.

778
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:25,417
Thanks!

779
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:26,959
You don't have to be
so formal with me.

780
00:59:29,292 --> 00:59:30,667
It's really good!

781
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:54,042
Why didn't you enroll yourself for
cultural programmes in class today?

782
00:59:54,584 --> 00:59:57,167
I'm not that good at anything.

783
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,792
But you sang in class
the other day.

784
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:01,584
I only sang because
the teacher forced me to.

785
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:02,792
Sing the same song then.

786
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:04,834
I don't know the whole song.

787
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:06,084
So learn the song!

788
01:00:06,084 --> 01:00:07,959
You'll win the competition for sure.

789
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:09,417
I've tried many times.

790
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:13,584
But whenever I listen to that song,
my dad scolds me and says that...

791
01:00:13,834 --> 01:00:16,459
it isn't a song kids should listen to.

792
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:19,459
If you have the lyrics to the song,
will you sing?

793
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:22,917
Then I can definitely try!

794
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:29,292
Hey! Where are you going?

795
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,751
I have work to do.
Don't tell anyone!

796
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:21,000
Dad...

797
01:01:21,959 --> 01:01:24,084
Where's the image we
prayed to in the morning?

798
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,417
Is it over there?

799
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:29,500
Okay, get back to work.

800
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,209
I prayed to you this morning.

801
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:40,250
And you made my dream
come true by the afternoon.

802
01:01:40,584 --> 01:01:42,584
You're all-powerful, Lord.

803
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:47,125
She said that she'll sing
on Independence Day.

804
01:01:47,459 --> 01:01:52,625
I found the lyrics book
with great difficulty.

805
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,125
This isn't due to
my efforts anyway.

806
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,667
I've understood that
you've blessed me.

807
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,584
You did this because I asked you just once.
Had I known I'd have asked you much earlier.

808
01:02:03,334 --> 01:02:05,417
Anyway, I'm asking you now.

809
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,667
Please unite us both.

810
01:02:17,084 --> 01:02:18,459
Dad.
- Yeah?

811
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:20,375
Will the idol be built here?

812
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:24,167
How tall will it be?

813
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:31,125
Thirty feet!?

814
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:34,750
Okay. Do it well.

815
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,709
Kids, today's the last day to enroll
yourself for the cultural programmes.

816
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:46,542
Would anyone like to do so?

817
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:49,542
Today's the last day.
Don't you want to participate?

818
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:51,584
But I don't know any songs.

819
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,667
Miss, Sunitha says that
she'd like to sing.

820
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:55,792
Miss...

821
01:02:55,959 --> 01:02:57,417
Very good, Sunitha!

822
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,042
I thought there were no singers
from our class.

823
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,667
I don't know any songs.

824
01:03:01,709 --> 01:03:03,125
Why did you do that?

825
01:03:08,542 --> 01:03:10,542
Hey, lyric book!
Where did you get it?

826
01:03:10,584 --> 01:03:12,084
Doesn't matter.
It's for you.

827
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,375
Thank you!
- Don't mention it.

828
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:15,834
But I want you to sing well.

829
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,459
I will definitely sing well..

830
01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:19,667
but where will I practice?

831
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:21,542
My dad will scold me
if he comes to know.

832
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:24,334
I want to register myself for Chess, miss.
- Is it?

833
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:26,292
Very good. Tell me
your full name.

834
01:03:28,709 --> 01:03:30,334
I have an idea!

835
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:31,875
Kids, silence!

836
01:03:31,959 --> 01:03:33,084
Let's start the class.

837
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:40,667
Hey, Sunitha will start
liking you now.

838
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,042
This is all due to the idol
that my dad's making.

839
01:03:44,209 --> 01:03:46,584
Pray to him if you have
someone in mind.

840
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:47,500
He will unite you both immediately.

841
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:49,125
I don't have anyone like you.

842
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:58,375
Jack and Jill went up the hill.

843
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:00,709
To fetch a pail of water.

844
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:03,792
I read this
when I was a child.

845
01:04:03,959 --> 01:04:06,167
I'm remembering them
as I climb these steps.

846
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:10,042
Thanks to you, I've got an
opportunity to climb the hill again.

847
01:04:10,834 --> 01:04:11,500
Come...

848
01:04:16,584 --> 01:04:19,584
We just started and
you're exhausted already?

849
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,875
It's only another
45 minutes from here.

850
01:04:22,334 --> 01:04:23,584
I'm too tired.

851
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,417
Let's sit for a moment
before we resume.

852
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:26,584
Okay. Sit here.

853
01:04:30,709 --> 01:04:32,625
I knew that something like this
would happen.

854
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:33,875
That's why I brought this.

855
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:36,500
What is this?
- Sugar water.

856
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:38,542
You are diabetic, right?

857
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,042
You remembered?

858
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,834
Yes, I remember.
Drink this. You'll feel better.

859
01:04:46,834 --> 01:04:47,875
Drink!

860
01:05:01,084 --> 01:05:02,500
Shall we start walking?

861
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:15,584
Mr. Raju...

862
01:05:18,834 --> 01:05:20,209
I can't do this.

863
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,667
What?

864
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,000
We would've reached by now
if we had taken the bus.

865
01:05:24,417 --> 01:05:25,750
How long will this go on?

866
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:28,750
I should've known.

867
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,917
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

868
01:05:32,209 --> 01:05:33,125
Come, come.

869
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:38,375
I can't go on
any longer.

870
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:40,459
I can't do this.

871
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:43,125
We're almost there.
- No. I can't walk any further.

872
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:45,875
I shouldn't have brought you here.
- My legs hurt.

873
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:48,917
I can't do this, Mr. Raju.

874
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,250
I can't do this.
- Come.

875
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:53,667
I cannot walk any further.
- I will take you there.

876
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:54,459
Come.

877
01:05:54,625 --> 01:05:55,667
I will take you there.

878
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:56,792
Get up. Come...

879
01:05:56,834 --> 01:05:58,000
Use my shoulders for support.

880
01:05:58,084 --> 01:05:59,459
Give me your hand.
Come...

881
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:00,334
Walk.

882
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:03,584
Let's go.

883
01:06:21,959 --> 01:06:23,209
Thank you.

884
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:26,875
Everything went well,
don't you think?

885
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:28,625
Yes, ma'am. Good, good.

886
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:32,125
Why did you refuse to
enter the temple?

887
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:34,959
Are you asking me why I didn't
enter the temple? - Yes.

888
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:37,875
I don't really believe in God.

889
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,250
Then who do you believe in?

890
01:06:41,959 --> 01:06:43,292
Me?

891
01:06:43,584 --> 01:06:45,209
I believe in people, ma'am.

892
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:48,584
They are the ones who are with us
during good and bad times.

893
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:52,250
So do you worship people?

894
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,417
Worship?

895
01:06:53,959 --> 01:06:55,625
There's no need of all that.

896
01:06:55,917 --> 01:06:59,542
It's sufficient to greet
people affectionately.

897
01:06:59,709 --> 01:07:01,709
They will give you
more than what God gives you.

898
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:03,750
For example, my friend
who's a barber...

899
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:06,667
gave me 10,000 rupees within
no time when I needed it.

900
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:10,250
The owner of my house doesn't bother me
even if I'm late on my rent.

901
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:11,750
My priest friend..

902
01:07:11,834 --> 01:07:16,084
prays to God on my behalf
for my well-being.

903
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:21,167
Just because I helped a friend
10 years ago I got the job in our office.

904
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:24,542
The people in my life have
helped me in many ways.

905
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:26,542
Is God greater than them?

906
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,750
Your philosophy is very nice.

907
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:38,625
"I feel tickled"

908
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:42,750
"By the way she looks at me"

909
01:07:43,584 --> 01:07:47,667
"I held your hands"

910
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:52,000
"And found limitless joy"

911
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:54,875
"You are a playful gal"

912
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:56,875
"And I'm mischievous"

913
01:07:57,334 --> 01:08:01,250
"Both of us are like Radha and Krishna"

914
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:06,167
"You are a queen,
And I'm a servant"

915
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,250

"Hold my hand and I promise
that I'll never let go"

917
01:08:53,167 --> 01:08:55,209
Joseph, a moment.

918
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,125
It's okay. Just ask him.

919
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,542
What is it?

920
01:08:59,959 --> 01:09:03,000
This is the first time we've
come outside without our parents.

921
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:05,334
This was really fun...

922
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:09,625
Will you take us to the
beach next Sunday?

923
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:11,750
Tell them that we will!

924
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:17,959
Sure.

[ Reading Telugu newspaper ]

926
01:09:25,292 --> 01:09:26,334
Mr. Raju...

927
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,292
I want to learn Telugu.

928
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,584
Will you teach me?

929
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,125
Why not?

930
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,459
I'll teach you.

931
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:39,667
What do your parents do?

932
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:41,625
My father passed away
when I was a child.

933
01:09:44,834 --> 01:09:46,250
What do your parents do?

934
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:49,209
I don't know who my father is.
- How come?

935
01:09:49,959 --> 01:09:52,084
My mother did the
same thing that I do.

936
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:54,625
Where is she now?

937
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:56,584
She passed away.

938
01:09:57,542 --> 01:09:58,334

Which god do you believe in?

949
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:41,292
I don't believe in God.

950
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:44,792
So are you okay with...

951
01:11:45,209 --> 01:11:46,084
me being Muslim?

01:11:46,209 --> 01:11:48,125

It's been 15 years since
my husband passed away.

01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:52,792
I have a 20-year old daughter.

I am diabetic.

01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,334
At this age,

975
01:13:58,959 --> 01:14:03,709
do you think it's even right to think
of marrying again?

976
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:05,250
There's nothing wrong with it.

977
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,417
If both of you are committed,
then there's nothing wrong in it.

So...

979
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:11,959

"Love knows no boundaries"

01:14:36,209 --> 01:14:41,584
My wife and I, too, were about your age
when we fell in love and married.

982
01:14:41,834 --> 01:14:44,543
Everything seems fun when you're young.
- Uncle, please!

983
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:47,959
Before you lecture us,
please hear us out.

984
01:14:48,459 --> 01:14:51,959
I love Joseph
and I'll marry no one but him.

01:14:52,584 --> 01:14:54,709
I plan to tell my parents about this

01:14:55,334 --> 01:14:58,084
So, there is no way
we'll change our minds.

987
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:03,584
Let it be.
You don't seem to understand.

988
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,209
Why did you even fall
for a guy like him?

989
01:15:06,459 --> 01:15:08,376
Why did your wife fall
for a guy like you?

990
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:15,959
Alright.
I get it.

991
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:20,209
But better be careful.

992
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:26,918
Being in love isn't always hunky-dory.
Bitter moments are bound to follow.

993
01:15:28,126 --> 01:15:29,459
Stay happy
and keep out of trouble.

994
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:32,459
Am I clear, Joseph?

995
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:35,459
Never hurt her no matter what.

996
01:15:37,209 --> 01:15:39,126
You needn't run
errands for me any more.

997
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:41,834
Find yourself a decent job.

998
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:45,834
It'll help your case when you ask her dad
for his daughter's hand.

999
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,584
Don't get him involved in our affairs.
- Sure, boss.

1000
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:52,626
You guys, too, look for decent jobs.

1001
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:55,584
Then find suitable girls
and settle down.

1002
01:15:56,334 --> 01:15:59,709
Now drop her off at her place.

1003
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:03,543
But don't step inside her home yet.
You'll get into trouble.

1004
01:16:04,834 --> 01:16:08,584
You guys, too, tag along with them.
But maintain distance.

1005
01:16:09,001 --> 01:16:13,751
Give them some privacy.
Am I clear?

1006
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:15,334
Go on, now.

1007
01:16:16,209 --> 01:16:18,501
See you later, uncle.
- See you later, sir.

1008
01:16:22,834 --> 01:16:24,959
It's a blessing in disguise
that Anil saw us both together.

1009
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:26,709
We now gained Ammoru's trust.

1010
01:16:27,043 --> 01:16:30,209
I feared that Ammoru
would rip me apart.

1011
01:16:32,626 --> 01:16:34,084
You guys leave now.

1012
01:16:34,251 --> 01:16:37,334
I'll go to Mandakini's place
and tell her about this.

1013
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:39,709
I'll walk with you to her place.

1014
01:16:40,084 --> 01:16:43,209
You're taking Ammoru's words literally.

1015
01:16:43,459 --> 01:16:46,418
You guys leave now.
I'll meet you this Sunday.

1016
01:16:47,334 --> 01:16:51,084
I can't meet you this sunday.
- Why not?

1017
01:16:52,126 --> 01:16:56,668
This Sunday I've to attend a communion.
- Is it? I'll join you then.

1018
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:01,001
Never mind. You'll find it boring.
- Are you finding it boring?

1019
01:17:01,293 --> 01:17:04,043
I converted to Christianity. So..
- Oh, stop it now.

1020
01:17:04,168 --> 01:17:06,334
I anyway have to get converted
after I marry you.

1021
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:08,209
So I better get used to it.

1022
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:15,376
Alright. Be at Gnanapuram bus stop
this Sunday by 9am sharp.

1023
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:16,751
I'll be there.

1024
01:17:25,543 --> 01:17:28,334
What did you say then?
- I was too scared to say anything.

1025
01:17:28,501 --> 01:17:30,793
I ran away.
- What?

1026
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:36,334
You left a girl all by herself?
You coward!

1027
01:17:37,668 --> 01:17:40,959
She is no girl.
She is 42 years old.

1028
01:17:41,293 --> 01:17:43,584
No molester would want to trouble her.

1029
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:46,834
That doesn't mean he can
leave a woman all by herself.

1030
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:51,126
I merely ran away. Any other guy
would've suffered a stroke right there.

1031
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:53,334
You should've been there
to witness it.

1032
01:17:53,876 --> 01:17:56,126
What on earth makes her think
of marrying again at this age?

1033
01:17:56,501 --> 01:17:59,459
Does she think she's still a girl.
- What's wrong if she wants to?

1034
01:17:59,793 --> 01:18:01,626
Expressing one's feelings is no crime.

1035
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:05,126
What do you plan to do now?
- What will I do now?

1036
01:18:05,501 --> 01:18:08,376
Don't you know
what I'll do now?

1037
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:10,376
I'm 49 years old now.

1038
01:18:10,584 --> 01:18:14,084
Villagers would laugh at me
if I marry now.

1039
01:18:15,126 --> 01:18:16,959
Why do you care
about the villagers?

1040
01:18:17,584 --> 01:18:19,709
Do you like her?

1041
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:26,084
Actually, I do like her.
- Look at this idiot blush.

1042
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:30,459
Aren't you ashamed to say that?
- What's there to be ashamed?

1043
01:18:30,959 --> 01:18:33,959
Don't pay heed to his words.

1044
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:37,876
You say you like her.
Then why don't you marry her?

1045
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:40,584
Cut it!
She is 42 years old.

1046
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:45,709
She's a widow
and also has a 20 year old daughter.

1047
01:18:45,793 --> 01:18:47,001
Aren't these reasons enough
not to marry her?

1048
01:18:47,084 --> 01:18:52,501
You speak like you'll get to marry
a damsel. You're already 49.

1049
01:18:52,626 --> 01:18:57,418
People are talking behind your back.
Some even say that you are gay.

1050
01:18:58,043 --> 01:19:00,209
I'm not lying.

1051
01:19:00,543 --> 01:19:03,876
Since you are 49, no woman
would be ready to marry you.

1052
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:07,293
Consider yourself lucky
that this woman proposed to you.

1053
01:19:07,668 --> 01:19:13,209
If you let go off this opportunity,
you'll remain unmarried forever.

1054
01:19:16,834 --> 01:19:24,626
"My fiancee is fearsome
like Goddess Kali."

1055
01:19:25,584 --> 01:19:32,959
"None can tackle her,
not even Muhammad Ali."

1056
01:19:33,293 --> 01:19:41,918
"Alluring and bewitching,
that's how good is her body."

1057
01:19:41,959 --> 01:19:51,209
"She makes me dizzy,
how I wish she spares me."

1058
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:59,584
"She is vibrant
yet fiery."

1059
01:20:00,501 --> 01:20:07,959
"She's explosive
yet lively."

1060
01:20:08,293 --> 01:20:15,168
"She's someone
not to be messed with, buddy."

1061
01:20:15,918 --> 01:20:22,043
If it wasn't for the gossip mongers,
I'd have married dozens of women by now.

1062
01:20:23,501 --> 01:20:29,668
Ma'am, I like you.
But I'm also scared about all this.

1063
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:35,168
You're an officer
and I 'm an attendant.

1064
01:20:36,751 --> 01:20:38,334
But I don't care.

1065
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,709
I'll marry you come what may.

1066
01:20:45,584 --> 01:20:49,459
If someone objects our union,
I'll deal with them.

1067
01:20:51,709 --> 01:20:58,459
I'll land flying kicks on them all,
just like how actor Chiranjeevi does.

1068
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:09,584
Ma'am, after we are married,
we'll go to Ooty for honeymoon.

1069
01:21:10,459 --> 01:21:12,751
Ever since I was a kid

1070
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:17,376
I always dreamt about going to Ooty
with my wife.

1071
01:21:18,584 --> 01:21:20,084
It's finally happening.

1072
01:21:22,459 --> 01:21:26,543
Why have you all gathered here?
- Look what your friend is up to.

1073
01:21:27,293 --> 01:21:29,459
Raju, why are you sleeping here?

1074
01:21:38,543 --> 01:21:39,418
Hey, Raju!

1075
01:22:24,209 --> 01:22:26,584
Sir, give this to me?
- What? Why?

1076
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:35,834
You can now have it, sir.

1077
01:22:52,209 --> 01:22:53,959
Ladies and gentlemen!

1078
01:22:54,334 --> 01:22:58,459
Since Raju is 49 years old
and still unmarried

1079
01:22:58,709 --> 01:23:01,459
all women are spreading
rumours about him,

1080
01:23:01,584 --> 01:23:03,334
and all men
are keeping distance from him.

1081
01:23:03,834 --> 01:23:08,876
So, I request all the villagers
to take part in the meeting

1082
01:23:09,001 --> 01:23:14,043
to be held this evening at the library
and knock some sense into his head.

1083
01:23:23,334 --> 01:23:26,418
Is it?
I'm starting right away.

1084
01:23:30,459 --> 01:23:33,459
Sir, please let the manager know
that I informed you before leaving.

1085
01:23:40,918 --> 01:23:44,751
Ma'am, an issue came up at home.
I'll call you later.

1086
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:59,793
Why are you bothered about my marriage?
- Villagers say that you are gay.

1087
01:23:59,959 --> 01:24:03,501
This is the kind of treatment
meted out to gays.

1088
01:24:03,584 --> 01:24:05,876
What nonsense!
How could anyone think I'm gay?

1089
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:09,876
How could anyone not think you are gay.
You are 49 and still unmarried.

1090
01:24:10,168 --> 01:24:12,584
Rumour is that you are molesting
young boys.

1091
01:24:12,751 --> 01:24:14,168
What?
- You heard me.

1092
01:24:14,293 --> 01:24:15,709
We've got proofs too.

1093
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:18,751
We were told you misbehaved
with a boy at the liquor store

1094
01:24:19,084 --> 01:24:21,334
and that you're squeezing
the muscles of the guys at the gym.

1095
01:24:21,459 --> 01:24:24,459
You also misbehaved with a boy
who was asleep at Koribilli street.

1096
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:25,918
His mother lodged a complaint.

1097
01:24:26,459 --> 01:24:29,834
We have all the proofs needed.
We summoned you only after verifying them.

1098
01:24:30,084 --> 01:24:33,834
He loves to play with kids.
That doesn't mean he is a gay.

1099
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:38,876
Why are you getting pissed?
I guess Raju turned you all gay

1100
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:41,834
since you guys always stick together.

1101
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:46,209
Sir, mind what you say.
Show some respect.

1102
01:24:46,501 --> 01:24:50,126
A miser son of a bitch like you
deserves no respect.

1103
01:24:50,376 --> 01:24:51,418
Don't you dare call me a miser?

1104
01:24:51,876 --> 01:24:54,293
You fish out money from our pockets
to run this place.

1105
01:24:54,376 --> 01:24:58,043
I'm not a moralless son of a bitch
like you are. - Mind your words.

1106
01:25:05,793 --> 01:25:09,376
Quit fighting, you guys!
Calm down and sit.

1107
01:25:11,251 --> 01:25:15,293
Don't deviate from the point at hand.
Boy, tell him why we summoned him.

1108
01:25:15,709 --> 01:25:18,584
Raju, we know
that you are a good man.

1109
01:25:18,793 --> 01:25:23,543
But since you are unmarried,
rumours about you are being spread.

1110
01:25:23,709 --> 01:25:27,084
People are taking those rumours seriously
and are lodging complaints against you.

1111
01:25:27,376 --> 01:25:30,709
If this situation persists,
you'll be forced to leave the village.

1112
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:35,376
So either you get married
and prove that you are not gay.

1113
01:25:35,584 --> 01:25:38,709
Or get banished from the village.
The choice is yours.

1114
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:44,626
You let us all down.
- I let you all down?

1115
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:48,459
Yes, you did.
People think you're gay for being unmarried

1116
01:25:48,584 --> 01:25:53,334
and we are gay
for hanging out with you.

1117
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:56,001
Unless you marry,
people won't let you stay here.

1118
01:25:56,334 --> 01:25:59,918
Have they gone nuts?
Who'll be willing to marry an oldie like him?

1119
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:03,126
What's done is done.

1120
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:06,959
You better marry that lady
before she changes her mind.

1121
01:26:07,209 --> 01:26:09,834
That way, you won't be banished.
- You are right.

1122
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:13,418
Raju, this is your last chance.
If you let go off her

1123
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:16,001
you'll have to face problems.
What do you say?

1124
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:19,209
You are right.
This is the last chance.

1125
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:22,334
There is the sign that I'm right.
The phone's ringing.

1126
01:26:22,668 --> 01:26:25,709
It is her calling.
- Answer the call.

1127
01:26:25,834 --> 01:26:27,626
What should I say to her?
- Don't you know?

1128
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:33,834
Tell her that you are ready to marry her
and be her husband.

1129
01:26:34,626 --> 01:26:36,834
I'm scared.
- I'll talk to her then.

1130
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:41,168
Hey, priest, don't..
- Talk to her, priest.

1131
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,334
Get married?
Mom, have you gone mad?

1132
01:26:56,584 --> 01:26:59,209
Do you even know
what you're saying?

1133
01:26:59,334 --> 01:27:01,584
I weighed all pros and cons
before I took this decision.

1134
01:27:01,834 --> 01:27:03,959
This is not just about you.

1135
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:06,834
People are going to talk
behind your back.

1136
01:27:06,876 --> 01:27:09,584
I don't care what people talk
behind my back.

1137
01:27:10,209 --> 01:27:14,209
What you think about this
is all that matters to me.

1138
01:27:14,584 --> 01:27:16,959
Stop all this nonsense
and go back to sleep.

1139
01:27:17,334 --> 01:27:20,084
Get your hands off me.
You say you are a feminist.

1140
01:27:20,584 --> 01:27:23,959
Talk about double standards.
- Quiet, mom. You'll wake everyone up.

1141
01:27:29,459 --> 01:27:34,459
Alright, mom.
Let's talk with calm heads.

1142
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,168
Where does he stay?

1143
01:27:40,126 --> 01:27:42,251
At R.P Peta.

1144
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:44,834
I would like to meet him.

1145
01:27:47,834 --> 01:27:50,584
Tomorrow, his friends are coming over
to have formal talks.

1146
01:27:50,959 --> 01:27:54,209
Would you like to join me?

1147
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:57,459
No!
I'd like to meet him alone.

1148
01:27:58,459 --> 01:28:00,334
Alright.
I'll let him know.

1149
01:28:03,209 --> 01:28:05,709
He reached
a helpless state

1150
01:28:06,334 --> 01:28:11,584
wherein his body was covered
with ash.

1151
01:28:13,959 --> 01:28:17,084
These people
are getting on to my nerves.

1152
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:21,209
I better hurry up.

1153
01:28:21,459 --> 01:28:24,668
A middle aged man then said

1154
01:28:24,709 --> 01:28:30,751
"I created a rule with my eyes."

1155
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:39,334
The bible says â€šÃ„Ã²Yehova
Man on the earth is honest,

1156
01:28:41,209 --> 01:28:46,626
Yehova is honest and practical.
Physically he lost everything.

1157
01:28:46,709 --> 01:28:50,459
He lost his wealth
and health.

1158
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:55,834
But his spirit was pious.
His spirit was detatched from pleasures.Ã¹

1159
01:28:57,626 --> 01:29:01,126
Mr. Murthy said you needed an insurance policy.
- That's right.

1160
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:05,834
Today being a Sunday,
I thought I'd meet you at home.

1161
01:29:05,959 --> 01:29:07,918
That's why I asked you to come home.
- Right.

1162
01:29:07,959 --> 01:29:10,001
Shall we start the process?
- Sure.

1163
01:29:19,918 --> 01:29:22,584
Every Sunday these worthless missionaries
have a field day.

1164
01:29:24,168 --> 01:29:26,418
May I have your full name, please?
- It's Paul Rajesh.

1165
01:29:27,084 --> 01:29:28,751
Paul..
- Rajesh.

1166
01:29:31,209 --> 01:29:33,209
I'm sorry for that impolite remark
about the missionaries.

1167
01:29:33,709 --> 01:29:35,959
We've got used to it.
Please finish the application now.

1168
01:29:38,418 --> 01:29:42,376
Y-Your name again, please.
- Paul Rajesh.

1169
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:47,793
Postal address, please.
- 34721 Gnanapuram Vishakapatnam 8

1170
01:29:47,834 --> 01:29:53,459
When one desires
to live like a realist

1171
01:29:53,834 --> 01:30:01,084
time and again he has to introspect.

1172
01:30:01,293 --> 01:30:04,834
The kind of nonsense
that these people preach.

1173
01:30:05,418 --> 01:30:08,751
I'm forging rules
with my eyes.

1174
01:30:09,709 --> 01:30:13,918
I've done it in the past.
And I'll always keep doing it.

1175
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:19,959
My dear brothers
and sister

1176
01:30:20,668 --> 01:30:21,834
that's why the Lord said

1177
01:30:22,418 --> 01:30:27,709
'If one's eyes are pure,
then he is a pure being.'

1178
01:30:58,001 --> 01:30:59,084
Are you Raju?

1179
01:31:00,668 --> 01:31:03,501
Are you Radha madam's daughter?
- Yes.

1180
01:31:05,709 --> 01:31:06,751
Please sit.

1181
01:31:11,751 --> 01:31:12,459
Be seated.

1182
01:31:17,959 --> 01:31:21,501
My mom told me about you.
- She called me up this morning

1183
01:31:21,626 --> 01:31:23,418
and said that you wanted to talk to me.

1184
01:31:24,959 --> 01:31:25,709
Tell me, then.

1185
01:31:27,584 --> 01:31:30,126
Do you really like my mom?

1186
01:31:31,584 --> 01:31:35,126
W-Well, I do like her
and I also..

1187
01:31:35,209 --> 01:31:40,209
Sit straight, will you?
And quit blushing like you were a girl.

1188
01:31:42,084 --> 01:31:44,959
So, you told my mom
that you'd marry her?

1189
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:49,334
Infact, she came up with the idea.
Later on, I accepted the proposal.

1190
01:31:49,793 --> 01:31:51,834
So, you mean my mom
was after you?

1191
01:31:52,084 --> 01:31:53,834
No!
That's not what I meant.

1192
01:31:54,084 --> 01:31:57,959
Whatever.
Why didn't you get married till now?

1193
01:31:58,084 --> 01:31:59,876
Well, I just didn't.
- What do you mean? Be clear.

1194
01:32:00,043 --> 01:32:03,418
I just didn't get married.
I can't elaborate why.

1195
01:32:03,876 --> 01:32:07,751
I had my own share of problems
and I don't wish talk about them.

1196
01:32:08,001 --> 01:32:12,876
Alright. Forget about it.
But I've got other questions for you.

1197
01:32:13,501 --> 01:32:14,459
What are they?

1198
01:32:21,459 --> 01:32:23,584
Everyday, we get to read it
in the newspapers

1199
01:32:23,876 --> 01:32:28,043
that men are duping women
by saying they are in love them.

1200
01:32:28,584 --> 01:32:32,251
Why shouldn't I think that you won't
dupe my mom after marrying her?

1201
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:33,959
What!
- You heard me.

1202
01:32:35,459 --> 01:32:38,751
You're a mere attendant.
You earn a meagre Rs. 8,000 per month.

1203
01:32:39,209 --> 01:32:42,168
At the same work place,
my mom is an high ranking official.

1204
01:32:42,584 --> 01:32:45,334
After all the cuttings
she still makes Rs. 22,000.

1205
01:32:45,834 --> 01:32:49,584
So, I doubt that you want to marry her
just for the sake of money.

1206
01:32:51,209 --> 01:32:54,834
Young people like you
tend to have doubts like these.

1207
01:32:55,584 --> 01:32:58,501
Are there any more questions?
- There are a lot more questions.

1208
01:32:58,834 --> 01:33:02,543
But first, answer this.
- Sure. I will.

1209
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:06,793
For all the questions that you might
probably ask, I've only one answer.

1210
01:33:07,418 --> 01:33:12,959
I'm not a young lad, who'd want
to dupe and cheat a woman.

1211
01:33:13,709 --> 01:33:14,834
I'm 50 years old.

1212
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:20,293
The only reason why people
of my age would want to get married

1213
01:33:20,376 --> 01:33:23,001
is to have companionship.
Nothing else matters.

1214
01:33:23,459 --> 01:33:27,834
You're still young. Once your old enough,
you'd understand me better.

1215
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:34,584
Your horoscope is compatible
with that of Raju's.

1216
01:33:35,293 --> 01:33:40,209
If you both marry,
you'll lead a happy life together.

1217
01:33:40,834 --> 01:33:47,751
This Monday is an auspicious day
for you to break this news to your brother.

1218
01:33:48,251 --> 01:33:49,334
Everything will be fine.

1219
01:33:49,626 --> 01:33:52,584
Will my brother approve of this wedding
if tell him on monday?

1220
01:33:53,084 --> 01:33:57,709
I'm the best priest in these villages.
My predictions always come true.

1221
01:33:58,209 --> 01:34:00,334
If you break this news to him
this auspicious monday

1222
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:04,459
he'll be more than glad.

1223
01:34:06,459 --> 01:34:08,209
There is the sign that I'm right.
The phone's ringing.

1224
01:34:10,834 --> 01:34:12,584
I'm here with Mr. Raju.

1225
01:34:15,584 --> 01:34:19,709
I spoke to him
and I feel he's a nice man.

1226
01:34:20,459 --> 01:34:23,334
I guess he'll take good care of you and me.
- Yes, he will.

1227
01:34:23,751 --> 01:34:27,126
But do you think your brother
would approve this?

1228
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:28,834
Forget about him.

1229
01:34:29,293 --> 01:34:31,459
Tell me if you approve
this marriage?

1230
01:34:31,584 --> 01:34:33,834
Yes, I do.
I've got no objections.

1231
01:34:34,126 --> 01:34:36,459
That's great.
See you at home, then.

1232
01:34:37,209 --> 01:34:41,084
Sure. We can then decide
what to do next.

1233
01:34:45,626 --> 01:34:47,084
I gave her my consent.
Are you now glad?

1234
01:34:47,876 --> 01:34:49,709
So glad
that I'm actually blushing.

1235
01:34:50,334 --> 01:34:52,709
But there is a glitch.
- What is it?

1236
01:34:53,334 --> 01:34:56,168
I never addressed
anyone as dad in 20 years of my life.

1237
01:34:56,584 --> 01:35:01,209
So, it'll take some time
before I begin to call you dad.

1238
01:35:01,418 --> 01:35:05,334
That's no problem at all.
Call me by my name. I won't mind.

1239
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:46,834
Are you cooking potato curry?

1240
01:35:54,459 --> 01:35:56,084
Let me have a piece!

1241
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:57,834
Where are you coming from?

1242
01:35:58,459 --> 01:36:00,084
I'd gone to Sushma's house because..

1243
01:36:00,084 --> 01:36:02,209
Sai Baba discourses were
being conducted over there.

1244
01:36:02,376 --> 01:36:04,959
I will thrash you if you lie to me!

1245
01:36:05,834 --> 01:36:08,126
Is Sushma's house in Ganapuram?

1246
01:36:08,334 --> 01:36:12,084
Are Christians conducting Sai Baba
discourses these days?

1247
01:36:12,334 --> 01:36:13,876
Did you see me?
So what?

1248
01:36:13,959 --> 01:36:15,709
Yes, I went to attend
a Christian meeting!

1249
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:17,334
Why did you go there?

1250
01:36:17,584 --> 01:36:19,709
I went there casually with a friend.
- Who?

1251
01:36:19,834 --> 01:36:21,334
The guy who was with you?

1252
01:36:21,459 --> 01:36:22,376
Who is he?

1253
01:36:22,501 --> 01:36:24,126
Like I said,
he's just a friend.

1254
01:36:24,209 --> 01:36:28,251
If he's just a friend, why
were you holding hands?

1255
01:36:31,334 --> 01:36:32,084
Okay.

1256
01:36:32,584 --> 01:36:34,292
I wanted to tell you after
I was done with my studies.

1257
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:36,084
But I don't think you can
wait until then.

1258
01:36:36,334 --> 01:36:37,334
Listen to me.

1259
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,084
His name is Joseph.

1260
01:36:40,209 --> 01:36:41,709
We're in love.

1261
01:36:41,834 --> 01:36:44,209
I want to marry him..
- Shut up!

1262
01:36:44,334 --> 01:36:45,459
Love, huh?

1263
01:36:45,584 --> 01:36:46,459
Why are you hitting me?

1264
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:48,209
I should kill you
for what you've done.

1265
01:36:48,334 --> 01:36:51,834
Being a Brahmin, you are
in love with a Christian!

1266
01:36:51,834 --> 01:36:53,001
Are you not ashamed
of yourself?

1267
01:36:53,084 --> 01:36:53,501
Why should I be?

1268
01:36:53,709 --> 01:36:56,501
Being a human being, you're discriminating
people based on their religion.

1269
01:36:56,584 --> 01:36:57,584
Are you not ashamed?

1270
01:36:57,584 --> 01:36:59,459
Look, I'll only
tell you once!

1271
01:36:59,501 --> 01:37:02,251
If you ever meet him or
go there again,

1272
01:37:02,334 --> 01:37:03,584
I'll kill you!

1273
01:37:03,876 --> 01:37:05,209
I am telling you
again and again!

1274
01:37:05,334 --> 01:37:07,334
I love him!
And I'll get married to him!

1275
01:37:07,376 --> 01:37:09,084
If such a day comes...

1276
01:37:09,251 --> 01:37:11,459
Then I'll hang myself right
in front of your eyes.

1277
01:37:11,626 --> 01:37:12,959
Are you blackmailing me?

1278
01:37:13,251 --> 01:37:15,376
This is what all parents
say to their children.

1279
01:37:15,542 --> 01:37:17,084
You think I am blackmailing you?

1280
01:37:17,584 --> 01:37:18,709
Do you want to see?

1281
01:37:18,709 --> 01:37:21,209
Even someone who's going to do it
won't say it so many times.

1282
01:37:23,959 --> 01:37:26,626
My dad isn't giving me any money
I'll play if it is for 5 bucks.

1283
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:28,084
Okay then. Let's play for 5 bucks.

1284
01:37:32,709 --> 01:37:34,209
Joseph, what's bothering you?

1285
01:37:37,501 --> 01:37:38,626
Thamma...

1286
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,251
I want to start working, man.

1287
01:37:41,709 --> 01:37:44,501
Looks like Ammoru's words
have reached your ears!

1288
01:37:44,626 --> 01:37:47,501
I'm not saying this because he said it.
I feel it myself.

1289
01:37:48,459 --> 01:37:50,501
We've led haphazard lives
up until now.

1290
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:52,001
But if we get married...

1291
01:37:52,126 --> 01:37:53,709
we'll have to take care of our family.

1292
01:37:53,876 --> 01:37:55,834
For that to happen, we need to find a job.

1293
01:37:55,959 --> 01:37:58,084
So, what do you want to do?

1294
01:37:58,209 --> 01:37:59,834
I have no idea, man.

1295
01:38:00,209 --> 01:38:02,334
What will you do?
-Me?

1296
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:04,251
My dad owns a barbershop.

1297
01:38:04,709 --> 01:38:06,751
I'll take over whenever he retires.

1298
01:38:07,084 --> 01:38:08,834
I'll make a living as a barber.

1299
01:38:09,584 --> 01:38:10,709
That's nice, man.

1300
01:38:11,876 --> 01:38:13,126
What about you, priest?

1301
01:38:14,084 --> 01:38:17,501
Didn't you just call me a priest?
My dad's teaching me holy chants already.

1302
01:38:17,709 --> 01:38:20,584
When I'm done learning, I won't be able to
loaf around with you guys.

1303
01:38:21,084 --> 01:38:24,001
He'll find me a job at a temple.
Discard a card, man.

1304
01:38:24,959 --> 01:38:25,709
Very nice, man.

1305
01:38:25,876 --> 01:38:27,876
You guys have dads who look out for you.

1306
01:38:29,126 --> 01:38:30,834
What about me?

1307
01:38:31,751 --> 01:38:32,959
Don't worry, man.

1308
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:35,209
Ammoru is looking for a job for you.

1309
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:37,126
Ammoru? What job, brother?

1310
01:38:37,376 --> 01:38:42,917
Ammoru knows a man called Narayan Rao
in Araku. He owns holiday cottages over there.

1311
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:47,251
He asked Ammoru for a reliable guy
to look after his business.

1312
01:38:47,584 --> 01:38:49,876
He's thinking of recommending you.
Will you do it?

1313
01:38:49,959 --> 01:38:52,001
Why even ask, brother?
I'll definitely do it!

1314
01:38:52,084 --> 01:38:52,834
Okay.

1315
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:56,001
You might have to go there in 2-3 days' time.
Be prepared.

1316
01:38:56,084 --> 01:38:57,959
Come to the gym tomorrow.

1317
01:38:59,084 --> 01:38:59,876
Sure, brother.

1318
01:39:00,084 --> 01:39:03,626
Hey, you guys keep playing.
I'm leaving.

1319
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:05,126
Will see you guys later.

1320
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:07,709
Walk slowly, brother. I think the earth
is shaking a little bit.

1321
01:39:08,001 --> 01:39:10,209
See you. Take care of that belly of yours.

1322
01:39:13,209 --> 01:39:14,292
What are you waiting for?

1323
01:39:14,501 --> 01:39:17,209
Go give her this piece of news.
She'll feel happy about it.

1324
01:39:17,459 --> 01:39:22,126
She's in the middle of her exams.
She said she can't meet me for a month.

1325
01:39:22,334 --> 01:39:26,667
She asked me not to disturb her,
and that she'll come see me if she wants.

1326
01:39:26,751 --> 01:39:28,834
She just left.

1327
01:39:29,584 --> 01:39:35,417
I'm thinking of joining the job without telling her.

1328
01:39:35,542 --> 01:39:39,292
Then I'll meet her with my salary in hand.

1329
01:39:40,584 --> 01:39:42,084
She'll be elated.

1330
01:39:43,376 --> 01:39:47,376
Meanwhile, if she comes to the gym,
you guys should cover for me.

1331
01:40:54,084 --> 01:40:56,876
Hey, Sunitha! You're next.

1332
01:40:57,334 --> 01:40:59,626
I'm so nervous!

1333
01:40:59,709 --> 01:41:01,209
Why? Stay confident.

1334
01:41:01,251 --> 01:41:04,376
You sing so well in front of me.
You can do it.

1335
01:41:05,626 --> 01:41:06,959
Okay, let's go.

1336
01:41:07,209 --> 01:41:07,959
Come.

1337
01:41:16,959 --> 01:41:21,501
"What a wonderful man you are,
You are mine, and only mine"

1338
01:41:22,126 --> 01:41:28,209
"I'll always be your slave
I'm yours, and only yours"

1339
01:41:28,876 --> 01:41:33,834
"My heart's secret has revealed itself to you
Play me as if I'm an instrument"

1340
01:41:44,334 --> 01:41:46,584
Hey, Bhadram. Give me a soda.

1341
01:41:48,459 --> 01:41:49,459
Make it fast.

1342
01:41:50,959 --> 01:41:52,584
The school looks busy today, eh?

1343
01:41:52,626 --> 01:41:57,042
They're organizing cultural programmes
on the occasion of Independence Day.

1344
01:42:00,834 --> 01:42:04,001
The dancing competition just got done.
Now they're singing.

1345
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:05,626
This girl's singing really well.

1346
01:42:05,709 --> 01:42:07,584
Her name's Sunitha, it seems.

1347
01:42:41,584 --> 01:42:43,376
How many times should I tell you
not to sing?

1348
01:42:43,834 --> 01:42:47,292
Why are you hitting her?
-Is this a song suitable for kids?

1349
01:42:47,334 --> 01:42:48,459
It's just a song, sir.

1350
01:42:48,584 --> 01:42:53,209
For now, it's just a song. Soon, she'll
want to know the meaning of the song.

1351
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:55,001
Don't teach me how to raise my child.

1352
01:42:55,084 --> 01:42:55,959
I should slap you first!

1353
01:42:56,001 --> 01:42:57,834
Please speak with respect, sir
- Why should I?

1354
01:42:58,084 --> 01:42:59,001
I should teach her a lesson!

1355
01:42:59,709 --> 01:43:04,001
Hey! Stop him. He's taking her away.
-Have you seen her dad? He'll beat me up for sure.

1356
01:43:04,084 --> 01:43:05,751
What a coward!

1357
01:43:21,251 --> 01:43:24,167
I'll kill you if you utter another word.

1358
01:43:24,876 --> 01:43:28,376
Why? What mistake did I commit?

1359
01:43:28,876 --> 01:43:31,084
Oh, you're speaking Telugu!
Did he teach you himself?

1360
01:43:31,501 --> 01:43:34,876
Do you understand what you're saying?
What will people think? They'll spit on you.

1361
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:37,501
Why? What have I done?

1362
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:40,501
Are you asking me?
Are you out of your mind?

1363
01:43:40,584 --> 01:43:44,959
You have a daughter who isn't married.
What will people think if you get married?

1364
01:43:44,959 --> 01:43:46,834
My reputation will go down the drain!

1365
01:43:47,126 --> 01:43:47,834
Uncle...

1366
01:43:48,001 --> 01:43:48,584
What is it?

1367
01:43:49,084 --> 01:43:51,334
I'm in love with a boy.

1368
01:43:51,584 --> 01:43:52,251
What?!

1369
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:55,376
Yes, uncle. I am in love with a boy.

1370
01:43:56,626 --> 01:44:00,917
What's wrong with the both of you?
Have you gone crazy?

1371
01:44:01,084 --> 01:44:03,334
What's wrong with falling in love?

1372
01:44:04,459 --> 01:44:07,626
You're so young! What do you even
know about love at this age?

1373
01:44:07,709 --> 01:44:08,501
Oh!

1374
01:44:09,501 --> 01:44:13,084
So, I'm too young to fall in love.

1375
01:44:13,126 --> 01:44:15,084
Okay, I'll forget him.

1376
01:44:15,459 --> 01:44:17,501
But my mom's old enough
to know better, right?

1377
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:19,376
Or do you think she doesn't
know any better?

1378
01:44:19,751 --> 01:44:20,751
So...

1379
01:44:20,959 --> 01:44:25,834
A girl my age doesn't have the right to
take her own decisions...

1380
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:27,834
And neither does a woman of mom's age.

1381
01:44:27,834 --> 01:44:28,959
Is that what you mean?

1382
01:44:29,084 --> 01:44:32,709
Will a woman ever be able to live life
on her own terms?

1383
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:35,834
Come with me.
-Stop!

1384
01:44:35,876 --> 01:44:37,459
Why should I? Move!

1385
01:44:38,209 --> 01:44:40,542
Answer me!
-Why should I?

1386
01:44:45,126 --> 01:44:45,876
Listen to me...

1387
01:44:46,376 --> 01:44:49,626
I raised your daughter since her childhood
because you were widowed.

1388
01:44:49,751 --> 01:44:52,626
I know that Raju!
He's an orphan.

1389
01:44:52,959 --> 01:44:54,334
You have no one else but me.

1390
01:44:54,459 --> 01:44:56,584
If you get married to him anyway...

1391
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:59,209
I'll never let you or your daughter
inside my house ever again.

1392
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:01,584
Do you want to orphan your daughter?

1393
01:45:01,834 --> 01:45:04,001
Think about it carefully.

1394
01:45:04,084 --> 01:45:04,834
Come with me.

1395
01:45:31,334 --> 01:45:32,334
Saleema.

1396
01:45:38,876 --> 01:45:40,459
What are you doing here?

1397
01:45:41,709 --> 01:45:43,209
Hush! Stop laughing.

1398
01:45:49,001 --> 01:45:50,709
Why did you come here?

1399
01:45:51,126 --> 01:45:52,834
The thing is...

1400
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:56,751
I did everything that you asked of me.
Will you do something for me?

1401
01:45:57,001 --> 01:45:58,001
What is it?

1402
01:45:58,584 --> 01:46:00,334
I want to...

1403
01:46:00,834 --> 01:46:02,042
...have a drink with you.

1404
01:46:02,209 --> 01:46:04,251
I thought that it was something else.

1405
01:46:04,334 --> 01:46:06,084
All of that's only after
we get married.

1406
01:46:10,084 --> 01:46:11,834
But there's no alcohol at home.

1407
01:46:11,959 --> 01:46:13,084
I came prepared.

1408
01:46:14,834 --> 01:46:15,834
Got whiskey.

1409
01:46:16,084 --> 01:46:17,209
Soda or water?

1410
01:46:17,459 --> 01:46:18,959
Only water.

1411
01:46:20,084 --> 01:46:22,792
Stay right here.
I'll go get omelettes.

1412
01:46:33,959 --> 01:46:34,709
Pinch me.

1413
01:46:39,251 --> 01:46:40,376
Pinch me here.

1414
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:48,084
This is the first time I'm
drinking with a girl.

1415
01:46:48,376 --> 01:46:51,001
But this isn't my first drink
with a guy.

1416
01:46:51,209 --> 01:46:53,959
I know. I've understood everything
about you.

1417
01:46:54,334 --> 01:46:55,751
What do you understand?

1418
01:46:56,209 --> 01:46:58,084
Not in a bad way...

1419
01:46:58,501 --> 01:46:59,334
In a good way.

1420
01:46:59,501 --> 01:47:02,876
You're fortunate to have found
a guy like me.

1421
01:47:07,334 --> 01:47:09,001
Have an omelette.

1422
01:47:13,126 --> 01:47:15,084
The first time you walked into
our wine shop...

1423
01:47:16,709 --> 01:47:18,584
Everybody was giving you
weird looks.

1424
01:47:19,584 --> 01:47:22,376
But you didn't care about all that.

1425
01:47:22,834 --> 01:47:24,334
You bought your bottle and left!

1426
01:47:25,709 --> 01:47:27,334
That very day I fell for you.

1427
01:47:27,834 --> 01:47:29,251
You live life on your own terms.

1428
01:47:29,834 --> 01:47:31,834
I'm the same.
I live life the way I want to.

1429
01:47:31,959 --> 01:47:33,084
Never change.

1430
01:47:34,251 --> 01:47:36,834
I used to become restless if I
didn't see these eyes for even a day.

1431
01:47:38,167 --> 01:47:40,542
You didn't come to the shop
29 times in the last year.

1432
01:47:41,042 --> 01:47:44,376
I would roam the streets
looking for you.

1433
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,001
But I never found you.

1434
01:47:58,459 --> 01:48:02,209
"As hope makes me her prisoner"

1435
01:48:02,376 --> 01:48:06,084
"Time plays its game"

1436
01:48:06,209 --> 01:48:12,626
"Which shore will my life reach?"

1437
01:48:14,334 --> 01:48:18,334
"The distance between us
is increasing by the second"

1438
01:48:18,459 --> 01:48:22,209
"When will this end?"

1439
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:28,751
"Will I ever be free
of this confusion?"

1440
01:48:30,209 --> 01:48:35,251
"There's a desperate struggle
in my heart"

1441
01:48:37,334 --> 01:48:40,084
"As I move on..."

1442
01:49:02,417 --> 01:49:05,501
"As chaos fills up your entire world"

1443
01:49:06,126 --> 01:49:13,376
"Your heart is struck by grief"

1444
01:49:14,084 --> 01:49:18,126
"As the full moon hides behind dark clouds"

1445
01:49:18,209 --> 01:49:21,626
"Your destination becomes obscure"

1446
01:49:22,084 --> 01:49:26,084
"As you are left hopeless in desperation"

1447
01:49:26,209 --> 01:49:29,334
"Will this feeling ever pass?"

1448
01:49:30,084 --> 01:49:36,876
"Who can explain the reasons
behind one's destiny?"

1449
01:49:38,126 --> 01:49:45,001
"You'll have to wait and see for yourself"

1450
01:49:46,209 --> 01:49:51,209
"There's a desperate struggle
in my heart"

1451
01:49:52,584 --> 01:49:55,209
Lord, why didn't Sunitha come to
school today?

1452
01:49:56,959 --> 01:50:03,251
You shouldn't have let me find the
book if you knew this would happen.

1453
01:50:06,334 --> 01:50:07,084
Anyway..

1454
01:50:07,334 --> 01:50:09,709
Make sure Sunitha comes
to school tomorrow.

1455
01:50:12,376 --> 01:50:16,001
"As hope makes me her prisoner"

1456
01:50:16,126 --> 01:50:19,834
"Time plays its game"

1457
01:50:19,959 --> 01:50:26,959
"Which shore will my life reach?"

1458
01:50:27,959 --> 01:50:35,584
"Who knows what's lurking
in the darkness?"

1459
01:50:35,834 --> 01:50:42,001
"Your destiny is your shadow"

1460
01:50:43,834 --> 01:50:51,126
"Who knows what's hiding
at the next turn?"

1461
01:50:51,876 --> 01:50:59,084
"Find it out for yourself"

1462
01:51:03,709 --> 01:51:07,876
"The drama of Life unfolds
over the entire world"

1463
01:51:07,959 --> 01:51:11,209
"But the plot remains unknown
to the characters"

1464
01:51:11,834 --> 01:51:15,876
"As your faith abandons you"

1465
01:51:15,959 --> 01:51:19,084
"Your tale remains unfinished"

1466
01:51:19,834 --> 01:51:27,209
"Go with the flow of life
and move on"

1467
01:51:27,834 --> 01:51:34,626
"You will have to wait
for tomorrow to unfold"

1468
01:51:35,834 --> 01:51:40,876
"There's a desperate struggle
in my heart"

1469
01:51:42,834 --> 01:51:47,167
You've just been transferred here, ma'am.
And you're asking for a transfer again.

1470
01:51:47,709 --> 01:51:49,501
Let me try.
Wait for 10 days.

1471
01:51:49,584 --> 01:51:53,126
We'll get you married at 10AM
in the morning on the 16th.

1472
01:51:53,459 --> 01:51:57,501
Things like flowers, fruits, holy thread
will have to be brought by yourselves.

1473
01:51:57,584 --> 01:51:59,876
Got it?
-Got it, sir.

1474
01:52:47,584 --> 01:52:49,584
Who knows about
this matter?

1475
01:52:49,959 --> 01:52:51,709
A few people know
about it.

1476
01:52:52,709 --> 01:52:54,501
The whole village must've
known by now.

1477
01:52:54,959 --> 01:52:58,001
Go give it to everybody.

1478
01:52:58,001 --> 01:53:00,626
Dad...
-Go.

1479
01:53:13,334 --> 01:53:16,001
He's worked very hard.
-Indeed, brother.

1480
01:53:17,584 --> 01:53:19,626
He is this year's Mr Andhra
for sure.

1481
01:53:20,376 --> 01:53:24,042
Why not? After all, he's worked
hard for 2 years.

1482
01:53:26,834 --> 01:53:29,167
Go. You can workout inside.

1483
01:53:30,126 --> 01:53:35,001
Take care of all his expenses.
-Sure, brother.

1484
01:53:35,334 --> 01:53:37,209
Dieting and all...
-Sure, brother.

1485
01:53:37,251 --> 01:53:39,584
Take personal care.
-Okay .

1486
01:53:41,334 --> 01:53:42,584
Hey Bhargavi...

1487
01:53:44,709 --> 01:53:47,376
I told you to let me know
if you had any problems, dear.

1488
01:53:48,334 --> 01:53:50,209
I didn't have time, uncle.

1489
01:53:51,459 --> 01:53:52,959
Let's go.
I'll speak with your dad.

1490
01:53:53,584 --> 01:53:56,876
You won't be able to
convince him, uncle.

1491
01:53:57,626 --> 01:54:00,501
I'll beat up your dad
if I have to! Let's go.

1492
01:54:01,709 --> 01:54:04,209
He hanged himself to
convince me, uncle.

1493
01:54:05,376 --> 01:54:07,084
What about Joseph?

1494
01:54:09,459 --> 01:54:10,709
I'm leaving, uncle.

1495
01:54:10,834 --> 01:54:13,376
How can you leave
without saying anything?

1496
01:54:13,626 --> 01:54:15,959
He's doing well at his new job.

1497
01:54:16,084 --> 01:54:17,209
Crazy guy!

1498
01:54:17,209 --> 01:54:18,459
Wait a second.

1499
01:54:18,584 --> 01:54:19,209
Hey...

1500
01:54:19,334 --> 01:54:20,834
Call Araku and ask
him to come immediately.

1501
01:54:21,251 --> 01:54:22,209
Araku?

1502
01:54:22,376 --> 01:54:24,876
Yeah...
Didn't he tell you?

1503
01:54:26,876 --> 01:54:28,209
Why didn't he tell you?

1504
01:54:28,334 --> 01:54:30,876
He's working in Araku
for a friend of mine.

1505
01:54:30,959 --> 01:54:32,501
He is earning well, too.

1506
01:54:32,959 --> 01:54:36,751
He's changed for you.
He's not what he used to be.

1507
01:54:37,376 --> 01:54:40,584
What's the use, uncle?
I'm getting married in the evening.

1508
01:54:40,834 --> 01:54:42,667
What? Today?

1509
01:54:44,626 --> 01:54:47,376
And you're telling me now?

1510
01:54:47,501 --> 01:54:50,084
Had you told me earlier,
I'd have done something.

1511
01:54:50,126 --> 01:54:52,459
I didn't have time.
- Bhargavi...

1512
01:54:55,334 --> 01:54:56,334
Bhargavi.

1513
01:54:56,751 --> 01:54:59,251
What's your dad's problem
with him?

1514
01:55:01,126 --> 01:55:01,876
Religion.

1515
01:55:03,834 --> 01:55:05,001
Religion, uncle.

1516
01:55:10,792 --> 01:55:13,000
It's high time
she learnt her lesson.

1517
01:55:13,917 --> 01:55:15,834
We have to confront her today.

1518
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,750
You're right. We'll teach that whore
a lesson she'd never forget.

1519
01:55:20,334 --> 01:55:24,125
She's a girl after all.
Let's be gentle.

1520
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:26,209
Yes, bro.
That's what I meant too.

1521
01:55:26,584 --> 01:55:29,125
Omar, keep your temper in check
when we confront her.

1522
01:55:29,584 --> 01:55:31,542
He'll do the talking
and we'll make no noise.

1523
01:55:36,959 --> 01:55:39,584
Here she comes.
- Let's go.

1524
01:55:43,167 --> 01:55:46,709
You visit the dargah at Gandhi Nagar, right?
- Yes, I do.

1525
01:55:47,417 --> 01:55:49,625
What's your name?
- Why do you care?

1526
01:55:50,417 --> 01:55:54,292
Karim said her is Saleema.
Isn't that your name?

1527
01:55:54,917 --> 01:55:56,959
We know that you are a muslim.

1528
01:55:57,167 --> 01:55:59,959
We see you daily at Convent Junction.
Why do you go there?

1529
01:56:00,125 --> 01:56:02,375
I've never been there.
- Don't lie.

1530
01:56:02,542 --> 01:56:05,042
We see you there everyday.
- What's your problem?

1531
01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:09,417
Aren't you ashamed to be a prostitute
despite being born as a muslim?

1532
01:56:09,584 --> 01:56:12,959
Didn't I tell you to stay calm.
Let him do the talking.

1533
01:56:13,542 --> 01:56:16,375
Bro, carry on.
- You are a muslim.

1534
01:56:16,584 --> 01:56:19,584
Prostitution is a sin.
So quit it right away.

1535
01:56:19,959 --> 01:56:23,542
I don't even know you.
And I don't care what you say.

1536
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:27,625
So, you better get lost.
- How dare you push him?

1537
01:56:48,292 --> 01:56:50,792
Why isn't she here yet?
- I got no clue either.

1538
01:56:51,167 --> 01:56:53,750
She should be here by now.
- By when should we be there?

1539
01:56:54,542 --> 01:56:56,834
By 10AM.
- It's already 9:30AM.

1540
01:56:57,792 --> 01:56:59,625
We'll be late.
Let's check at her place.

1541
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:05,000
She won't like it. She says
her neighbours would gossip.

1542
01:57:05,084 --> 01:57:08,375
What would they gossip about?
After all, you're going to be her husband.

1543
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:09,459
Let's go fetch her.

1544
01:57:17,459 --> 01:57:20,334
Is my bride all dressed up?
Why are you so serious?

1545
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:23,459
Hurry up, bro.

1546
01:58:19,042 --> 01:58:22,959
She had a death which every whore deserves.
Why even bother investigate?

1547
01:58:23,334 --> 01:58:26,625
Go and bury her somewhere.
If not, we'll inform the municipal office

1548
01:58:26,834 --> 01:58:29,209
and ask them to cremate her body
in the electric box.

1549
01:59:27,959 --> 01:59:31,542
Focus only on people who've voting rights.
- Alright.

1550
01:59:31,625 --> 01:59:34,042
Don't bribe the people
who have no voting rights.

1551
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:36,917
If needed, we'll deal with them later.
Go answer the door.

1552
01:59:43,834 --> 01:59:45,334
How are you doing, bro?

1553
01:59:46,542 --> 01:59:47,750
Come in, Joseph.
I'm doing good.

1554
01:59:49,209 --> 01:59:50,959
Be seated, Joseph.
- How are you, sir?

1555
01:59:51,167 --> 01:59:53,042
I'm good.
Be seated.

1556
01:59:53,292 --> 01:59:56,209
Sir, have some sweets.
- Why? Anything special?

1557
01:59:56,542 --> 01:59:59,125
I got my first pay check.
- That's great.

1558
02:00:02,292 --> 02:00:04,792
Do you like your job?
- You helped me land that job.

1559
02:00:04,917 --> 02:00:08,292
It's as good as it can get.
A month passed by real quick.

1560
02:00:08,917 --> 02:00:10,750
Are you being treated well?

1561
02:00:11,209 --> 02:00:13,917
Very well, indeed.
Mr. Narayan Rao takes good care of me.

1562
02:00:14,875 --> 02:00:18,667
Of course he would. He's a fine man.
He respects me a lot.

1563
02:00:18,917 --> 02:00:20,375
Alright, sir.
I'll take your leave.

1564
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:23,500
Where are you going?
To meet your friends?

1565
02:00:23,917 --> 02:00:26,459
No, sir.
I'm going to meet Bhargavi.

1566
02:00:26,792 --> 02:00:28,375
I didn't meet her for a month now.

1567
02:00:28,875 --> 02:00:30,334
Now that I've received my salary,
I want to meet her.

1568
02:00:35,667 --> 02:00:38,625
Sit down.
I want to have a word with you.

1569
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:42,459
Sit down.
- What about, sir?

1570
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:49,792
Well..
It's about..

1571
02:00:51,292 --> 02:00:53,167
Bhargavi got married!

1572
02:02:09,084 --> 02:02:10,417
Let's finish it in two days.
- Excuse me.

1573
02:02:11,667 --> 02:02:14,000
Who are you?
- I'm Sunitha's classmate.

1574
02:02:14,292 --> 02:02:16,959
My name is Sundaram.
Is Sunitha home?

1575
02:02:17,084 --> 02:02:18,542
Why do you ask?

1576
02:02:19,167 --> 02:02:22,834
My social studies notes are incomplete.
So, I want to refer her notes.

1577
02:02:23,209 --> 02:02:27,542
Sunitha missed school for 10 days, right?
- I missed more than that.

1578
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:31,167
Students miss notes
and teachers don't even care.

1579
02:02:31,542 --> 02:02:33,542
What a worthless school this is.

1580
02:02:40,834 --> 02:02:43,209
Which notes do you want?
- Social notes.

1581
02:02:50,792 --> 02:02:51,209
Here you go.

1582
02:02:52,667 --> 02:02:54,834
Isn't Sunitha at home?
- Why do you ask?

1583
02:02:54,917 --> 02:02:56,417
Just to say thanks
for lending me this book.

1584
02:02:56,417 --> 02:02:58,959
Not needed. You needn't return the notes.
- Won't Sunitha need it?

1585
02:02:59,542 --> 02:03:01,750
Sunitha is now attending
another school.

1586
02:03:01,834 --> 02:03:03,667
What!
She's attending another school?

1587
02:03:03,792 --> 02:03:05,209
Yes, she is.

1588
02:03:05,584 --> 02:03:09,875
Since I work for the government,
I made Sunitha attend a government school.

1589
02:03:10,292 --> 02:03:12,042
But that is pathetic school.

1590
02:03:12,584 --> 02:03:16,375
That's why I got her enrolled
at an english medium school in Delhi.

1591
02:03:16,584 --> 02:03:18,417
She's in Delhi now?
- Yes, she is.

1592
02:03:19,042 --> 02:03:21,584
She'd stay there in Delhi at a hostel
till she completes her studies.

1593
02:03:23,042 --> 02:03:24,875
You are still here?
Get going now.

1594
02:04:41,292 --> 02:04:44,084
Once we get paid tomorrow

1595
02:04:44,834 --> 02:04:47,042
we'll go to the market
and buy new clothes.

1596
02:04:48,417 --> 02:04:52,167
Shall we offer prayers to the idol
you made, on the day of the festival?

1597
02:04:52,292 --> 02:04:54,667
Sure.
- Just look at your pride.

1598
02:04:56,792 --> 02:04:59,167
It's been long
since you had a good night's sleep.

1599
02:04:59,542 --> 02:05:01,167
Sleep now.
I'll wake you up early tomorrow.

1600
02:05:07,542 --> 02:05:09,042
W-Where's Sundaram?

1601
02:05:11,334 --> 02:05:14,417
He must be hanging out somewhere.
He'll be back soon. Sleep now.

1602
02:05:23,292 --> 02:05:26,250
Not now.
Get some sleep.

1603
02:05:54,667 --> 02:05:59,209
How could you be so mean to me?
I had blind faith in you.

1604
02:06:02,167 --> 02:06:04,792
I pleaded you
to unite me with Sunitha.

1605
02:06:06,167 --> 02:06:09,167
Sunitha's father sent her away to Delhi.

1606
02:06:10,084 --> 02:06:13,917
I want to meet Sunitha.
Bring her to me.

1607
02:06:15,542 --> 02:06:17,625
I believed that you possessed
divine powers.

1608
02:06:19,250 --> 02:06:21,667
But now I realise
that it's all crap.

1609
02:06:22,042 --> 02:06:23,500
Sunitha has gone
miles away from me.

1610
02:07:08,875 --> 02:07:13,542
S-Sir.
D-Did you like..

1611
02:07:46,959 --> 02:07:51,084
If you don't deliver the idol by noon,
we won't pay you a penny.

1612
02:07:51,709 --> 02:07:54,084
How could you be so reckless?

1613
02:07:54,167 --> 02:07:57,917
It served us right
for trusting an imbecile like him.

1614
02:07:58,042 --> 02:08:01,084
He screwed us up big time.
- What an idiot he turned out to be.

1615
02:08:01,834 --> 02:08:03,209
Allegedly, the best craftsman in town.

1616
02:10:36,542 --> 02:10:38,917
Get out of my house you two!
You've brought me disgrace.

1617
02:10:39,292 --> 02:10:41,417
Don't even think
we've nowhere else to stay but here.

1618
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:44,792
Get out then.
- That man is crossing all limits!

1619
02:10:45,459 --> 02:10:48,250
Take it easy.
Calm down now.

1620
02:10:48,792 --> 02:10:51,000
How could I take it easy
when he's crossing the line?

1621
02:10:51,959 --> 02:10:54,167
It's all my fault.

1622
02:10:54,834 --> 02:10:57,584
If I hadn't come here,
I wouldn't have met Raju

1623
02:10:57,917 --> 02:10:59,459
and none of this
would've happened.

1624
02:11:00,167 --> 02:11:02,500
I know what to do.
Give me your phone.

1625
02:11:04,292 --> 02:11:06,167
Whom are you calling?
- Raju.

1626
02:11:07,084 --> 02:11:10,584
Why?
- I want him to elope with you.

1627
02:11:10,667 --> 02:11:14,125
If I elope despite being so old
I'll become the butt of jokes.

1628
02:11:14,292 --> 02:11:17,209
You should've thought of that
when you fell in love.

1629
02:11:17,459 --> 02:11:20,209
Whatever. Don't call him now.
Give back my phone.

1630
02:11:21,959 --> 02:11:23,792
Give me the phone.
- You be quite and sit here.

1631
02:11:24,417 --> 02:11:28,542
Aditi, give me the phone.
Open the door.

1632
02:11:29,042 --> 02:11:32,875
Aditi, open the door.
Open the door.

1633
02:11:44,542 --> 02:11:46,459
Why is Radha calling me
at this hour?

1634
02:11:52,334 --> 02:11:54,584
Hello.
- Hi, Dad.

1635
02:11:55,542 --> 02:11:58,750
Dad?
Who is this?

1636
02:11:59,125 --> 02:12:02,917
Don't play innocent with me.

1637
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:06,709
Who else would call you up from this number
and address you as Dad?

1638
02:12:07,584 --> 02:12:10,459
Is this Aditi?
- Yes, it is me.

1639
02:12:11,834 --> 02:12:14,750
Tell me, Aditi.
- I want you to run away with my mom.

1640
02:12:15,084 --> 02:12:17,334
Run away with your mom?
What do you mean?

1641
02:12:17,959 --> 02:12:23,250
Hell with this old chap!
I want you to elope with my mom.

1642
02:12:23,834 --> 02:12:26,875
What rubbish!

1643
02:12:27,459 --> 02:12:30,417
People will laugh at us.

1644
02:12:30,709 --> 02:12:34,167
Now I know why the entire village
thinks you are gay.

1645
02:12:34,542 --> 02:12:36,209
They call you gay
for being such a coward?

1646
02:12:36,542 --> 02:12:40,500
Mind your tongue. I'm older than you.
You better show some respect.

1647
02:12:40,667 --> 02:12:44,834
Don't get so pissed.
Like they say, truth is always bitter.

1648
02:12:45,084 --> 02:12:48,375
I won't tolerate
your taunts anymore.

1649
02:12:48,542 --> 02:12:51,209
Your male ego got bruised
by my taunts, is it?

1650
02:12:51,334 --> 02:12:55,125
If you're really man enough,
prove it by eloping with my mom.

1651
02:12:55,334 --> 02:12:56,417
Don't you dare challenge me.

1652
02:12:57,167 --> 02:12:59,709
I'm gutsy enough to elope
and marry your mom right away.

1653
02:12:59,792 --> 02:13:02,709
Don't big talk.
Come here and prove your worth.

1654
02:13:02,834 --> 02:13:06,292
I'm coming right away.
You've crossed all limits by provoking me.

1655
02:13:06,959 --> 02:13:08,834
It's high time
I showed you my true mettle.

1656
02:13:29,625 --> 02:13:34,959
With fancy AC stores coming up,
my business took a big blow.

1657
02:13:35,459 --> 02:13:37,542
I'm forced to borrow money
to make ends meet.

1658
02:13:39,959 --> 02:13:41,042
And also..

1659
02:13:44,209 --> 02:13:46,667
Hey, Raju!
Where is he headed?

1660
02:13:48,542 --> 02:13:49,209
Raju!

1661
02:13:54,959 --> 02:13:56,084
Raju, wait up!

1662
02:14:01,917 --> 02:14:03,375
Why is he crossing over
to that village?

1663
02:14:04,750 --> 02:14:07,042
I guess he is upto
something dangerous.

1664
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,625
Hey, you two, follow me.

1665
02:14:20,792 --> 02:14:24,875
Aditi, what are you making us do?
This will cause many problems.

1666
02:14:25,042 --> 02:14:29,667
If you're really scared like you say,
you wouldn't even attempt climbing down.

1667
02:14:30,667 --> 02:14:33,375
Why don't you listen
to what your heart says?

1668
02:14:33,459 --> 02:14:36,459
I know you want to do this.
So, hurry up and climb down.

1669
02:14:36,834 --> 02:14:37,959
Get down, ma'am.

1670
02:14:38,293 --> 02:14:41,459
Your daughter is underestimating us.
Let's prove her a point.

1671
02:14:41,584 --> 02:14:42,584
Shut up, Raju!

1672
02:14:43,584 --> 02:14:45,584
I won't tolerate
another word against my daughter.

1673
02:14:46,418 --> 02:14:49,168
Hurry up, mom!
Uncle would be here anytime.

1674
02:14:49,334 --> 02:14:50,876
Manohar should be
back home by now.

1675
02:14:51,959 --> 02:14:53,584
Hold on to the rope tight.

1676
02:14:55,584 --> 02:14:58,043
Oh my god! Manohar is back.
- Ma'am, hurry up!

1677
02:15:00,501 --> 02:15:01,709
They are almost here.
Let's run.

1678
02:15:11,334 --> 02:15:15,084
Ma'am, keep moving.
- My stomach is hurting.

1679
02:15:16,959 --> 02:15:19,293
I shouldn't have fallen
for you daughter's bait.

1680
02:15:20,459 --> 02:15:24,334
You are too sick and I'm too old
for all these adventures.

1681
02:15:25,959 --> 02:15:28,459
Ma'am, they are here.
Let's go!

1682
02:15:40,876 --> 02:15:44,168
My village is beyond that level crossing.
We'll be safe if we get there.

1683
02:15:44,459 --> 02:15:45,043
Hurry up.

1684
02:15:57,459 --> 02:15:59,501
There are almost here!
- Oh, no!

1685
02:16:01,334 --> 02:16:02,084
Oh, no!
They are here.

1686
02:16:17,209 --> 02:16:18,584
This serves you both well.

1687
02:17:51,459 --> 02:17:54,668
Why don't you come closer
and sit here?

1688
02:17:55,459 --> 02:17:57,834
This is the first time I'm consummating
a relation. So, I'm shy.

1689
02:17:58,334 --> 02:17:59,084
Aren't you shy?

1690
02:18:00,209 --> 02:18:03,668
Why would I be shy?
This is the second time I'm doing it.

1691
02:18:04,626 --> 02:18:06,209
Don't be shy.
Come sit here.

1692
02:18:07,584 --> 02:18:08,459
I'm too shy for that.

1693
02:18:50,709 --> 02:18:56,251
Hadn't it been for the people of this village,
we wouldn't have got married.

1694
02:18:57,126 --> 02:18:58,959
Yes, ma'am.
That's true.

1695
02:19:00,459 --> 02:19:02,584
The entire village
stood by us.

1696
02:19:03,376 --> 02:19:08,251
My fellow villagers were always more concerned
than I was about me getting married.

1697
02:19:08,584 --> 02:19:09,584
I don't know why though.

1698
02:19:11,001 --> 02:19:15,001
Do you mind if I ask you something?
- Not at all.

1699
02:19:15,876 --> 02:19:19,834
Why have you remained unmarried
till this day?

1700
02:19:20,376 --> 02:19:23,584
Well..
It just so happened.

1701
02:19:24,834 --> 02:19:28,584
Were you in love
with anyone?

1702
02:19:29,293 --> 02:19:32,834
Well..
Yes, I was.

1703
02:19:34,001 --> 02:19:38,209
While I was in school,
I fell in love with a girl named Sunitha.

1704
02:19:41,834 --> 02:19:43,834
She was so pretty.

1705
02:20:03,418 --> 02:20:06,084
I was around 23 years old

1706
02:20:07,168 --> 02:20:09,709
when I fell in love
with a Brahmin girl named Bhargavi.

1707
02:20:10,168 --> 02:20:11,626
But she was forced
to marry some other guy.

1708
02:20:35,626 --> 02:20:37,334
I was about 33 years old

1709
02:20:38,334 --> 02:20:40,876
about the time
my hairline started to receed

1710
02:20:42,001 --> 02:20:44,459
when I fell in love
with a muslim girl.

1711
02:20:49,084 --> 02:20:52,793
She got killed.
- What! How did that happen?

1712
02:20:53,209 --> 02:20:56,251
I got no clue
how she got killed.

1713
02:21:13,126 --> 02:21:18,918
Since then, I was in no mood
to fall in love, until I met you.

1714
02:21:20,543 --> 02:21:22,626
I hardly ever ventured out of this village.

1715
02:21:23,251 --> 02:21:27,501
But, I keep seeing my past
and myself in my fellow villagers.

1716
02:21:27,959 --> 02:21:30,959
Whenever I see a school kid
or a 20 year old lad

1717
02:21:31,834 --> 02:21:35,876
or a man in his 30s,
I can't help it but stare at them.

1718
02:21:36,668 --> 02:21:40,376
That's the reason why
I'm considered gay by my villagers.

1719
02:21:42,084 --> 02:21:45,376
Quit laughing.
It's not funny at all.

1720
02:21:45,834 --> 02:21:48,501
I'm sorry.
- Whatever. Get some sleep now.

1721
02:21:49,084 --> 02:21:50,168
If not, we'll be late for work.

1722
02:21:51,376 --> 02:21:54,668
Oh no! There is a power outage.
- A power outage?

1723
02:21:55,376 --> 02:21:57,876
I'll see what I can do.

1724
02:22:00,251 --> 02:22:04,376
Silence, guys. I've got a phone call.
It is from Raju!

1725
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:08,418
I guess he wants your advice
about how to consummate the marriage.

1726
02:22:08,459 --> 02:22:11,459
Cut your nonsense!
Yes, Raju, any problem?

1727
02:22:12,709 --> 02:22:15,793
A power outage!
What can I do about it?

1728
02:22:16,543 --> 02:22:19,293
You need an electric generator?

1729
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:24,501
You maybe my friend,
but I can't lend you my generator for free.

1730
02:22:25,334 --> 02:22:28,668
Since, it is your first night post wedding,
I'm charging you a mere Rs. 2,000.

1731
02:22:29,459 --> 02:22:32,793
Rs. 2 was your price as a kid.
Then it was Rs. 200.

1732
02:22:33,293 --> 02:22:36,459
Now it is Rs. 2,000.
Wonder why you love the digit 2 so much.

1733
02:22:37,001 --> 02:22:40,501
Alright. Rs. 2,000 is fine with me.
- Cool. I'll be there then.

1734
02:22:41,668 --> 02:22:45,834
Raju wants me to set up the generator
at his place. I'll leave now.

1735
02:22:46,084 --> 02:22:49,417
Alright, guys.
Have a good one.
