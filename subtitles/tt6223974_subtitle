every more than 100 years.

183
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:56,120
- 175 years, something like that.

184
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:58,042
- Once every 176 years.

185
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,798
- [NARRATOR] The previous time it happened

186
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,168
exploration was wooden sailing ships.

187
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,337
- It was named The Outer
Planets Grand Tour,

188
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,217
and the cost of the
mission was estimated to be

189
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:13,177
in excess of a billion dollars.

190
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,972
The NASA administrator
went to the President,

191
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,771
and he said "The last time the planets

192
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,976
"were lined up like that,

193
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,821
“President Jefferson was
sitting at your desk,

194
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:25,235
"and he blew it.“

195
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,575
So, Mr. Nixon laughed and
said "All right, just do two.“

196
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,114
So, only two planets.

197
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,909
And of course the price tag consequently

198
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,833
was substantially less.

199
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:43,957
But we all knew that
the launch was in 1977

200
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,878
which would be after
Mr. Nixon's second term.

201
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,597
And of course it turned out

202
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:54,176
that his term ended a lot
sooner than even he thought.

205
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:05,989
in July of 1972.

206
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,696
And we had 11 scientific instruments,

207
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:09,983
11 different teams.

208
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:14,205
And the mission success was
one spacecraft past Saturn.

209
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,288
- [NARRATOR] But we knew
right from the get go

210
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:20,619
that we were going to
try as hard as we could

211
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,081
to extend the mission to
go to Uranus and Neptune.

212
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,426
- [NARRATOR] We selected
trajectories to pick

213
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:28,961
A target at Saturn that would give us

214
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,420
an assist to Uranus.

215
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,300
And so we designed that
in from the beginning.

216
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:36,135
We knew that we were endowing Voyager

217
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,763
with the option if the
chance was there to use it.

- We didn't want to build
anything into the design

220
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,590
that would have prevented
us from going further.

221
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:08,750

heartbeat of the ship itself.

The reason why it's going

Well I thought that was great.

find this record out there?

He was a working scientist.

He played a key role in many

Including the Voyager One.

He's one of the scientists
on the Voyager imaging team.

248
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,696
But he also was the astronomer who was

249
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:18,287
as much as any one person,

250
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:21,907

a somewhat crusty old fellow

253
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,299
who upon thinking about
the stars, a sad spectacle.

254
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:40,259
“If they be inhabited, what
a scope for misery and folly.

255
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,804
“If they be not inhabited,
what a waste of space.“

(LAUGHTER)

257
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,148
- Carl Sagan was a good friend of mine

258
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:48,517
and I called him up and
said, "Hey, would you

259
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,852
"be willing to undertake,
to come up with something

260
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,479
"for us to put on the Voyager spacecraft?"

261
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,564
He says "Yes, sure."

262
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,487
And he told me he could
it for 25,000 bucks.

263
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:59,283
So I authorised him to go ahead and do it

264
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:02,447
and I sort of was hands off at that point.

265
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,416
The whole creation was his and this group

266
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,535
that he put together.

267
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,254
- They figured don't let
this opportunity pass.

268
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,293
You're gonna throw a message
in a bottle into the ocean,

269
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:12,586
put a message in it.

270
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:16,213
And so they decided to put
time capsules in those bottles.

271
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:18,088
- And at first Carl thought they'd simply

272
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,716
do another plaque, maybe
with some more information.

273
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,093
But Frank Drake, a brilliant man.

274
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,267
Kind of a cross between Albert Einstein

and Thomas Edison.

00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,984
He came up with the idea that for

00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:37,359
the same amount of weight and space,

281
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,693
you could send a phonograph record.

285
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,082
because the Golden Record
gets more attention

286
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,916
than all the wonderful things they did

But the main attention
goes to the Golden Record.

290
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,969
Because of the aura that
surrounds anything to do

291
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,467
with extraterrestrial intelligent life,

292
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,970
any kind of effort to contact

293
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:07,763
extraterrestrial life is more fascinating

294
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,107
than knowing the chemical makeup

295
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:11,433
of a mineral on Mars or something.

- [NARRATOR] The record is
an old-style LP recording.

The only difference is it's on metal,

299
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:20,447
and that's so it will last a long time.

300
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:22,069
- And it was recorded at half-speed

301
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,863
so that gave us two hours of total time.

302
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,740
An hour and a half of
it was devoted to music

303
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,159
and the other half hour contains

304
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,124
all of the other data on the record,

305
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,373
the natural sounds of
Earth, the spoken greetings,

00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:37,417
and the encoded photographs of Earth.

307
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,169
- [NARRATOR] One of the first
questions a lot of people ask

308
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,423
is, well, they'll never
figure out how to play it.

309
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:44,883
And in fact, we included
a cartridge and stylus

310
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,431
in the package with the record,

311
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:48,470
and the drawing on the cover

312
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,064
of the record shows the method

313
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:54,351
by which the stylus is to
be placed on the record.

314
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,729
- Maybe what's written on it

315
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,149
will seem like kindergarten
scribbles to them,

316
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,399
but they should be able to figure it out

317
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,868
if they've got some smart minds

318
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,819
or whatever's in their heads,

319
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,570
if they even have heads.

320
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,699
- The Voyager launched
at the 100th anniversary

321
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,620
of the development of the
phonograph record by Edison.

322
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:12,712
And so it was a natural medium to put

323
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,413
the information on.

324
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,711
But what I find interesting is

325
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:19,209
to protect it from the
dust and tiny particles

326
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,254
of the journey, they put a cover over it.

327
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,678
And on the cover was engraved

328
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,053
the location of earth, our solar system

329
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,141
in terms of it's direction
from different pulsars.

330
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,437
- A lot of people would say,
"Well why would you do that?"

331
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:36,275
I said, "What do you mean?“

332
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,237
They said “Well why would
you announce where you are?"

333
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,855
'Cause there are aliens out there that

334
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,234
probably raid planets
and use them for food,

335
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,276
or eat the people, or make them slaves.

336
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,075
If they find it, their
technology is probably

337
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,112
more advanced than ours.

338
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,328
They'll come here and destroy it.

339
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:49,915
So why would you do something like that?

340
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,576
So if somebody did find it
they would be thinking that way

341
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,830
and they said, "Why would
these people expose themselves

342
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:58,457
"to our veracious appetites
or whatever it is.

343
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,007
"They must be very altruistic.“

344
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,382
- The chance that advanced intelligence

345
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,218
beyond us would detect "Oh, hey,

346
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:14,556
"there is a radiating
body coming into our area,

347
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:18,232
"let's go out and find out
what this bottle in the ocean,

348
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,520
“what message it might have."

349
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,899
Now is that a grand mystery?

350
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,284
Whoa!

351
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,076
- Well that brings up the whole question,

352
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:31,948
is there anybody out there?

353
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,791
Listen,

354
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,703
there are give or take

00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,040
200 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.

356
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,715
There are about 200 billion
galaxies in the universe.

00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:45,921
Or at least in the universe we know about.

358
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,215
- It's a pretty small spacecraft

359
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,092
and it's a pretty big universe.

360
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,303
If you take a piece of sky

361
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,103
the size of a soda straw up there

362
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,184
in the Big Dipper,

363
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,485
in that tiny piece of what
we thought was blank sky

364
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,940
was thousands of galaxies.

365
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,942
And each one of those galaxies

366
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,742
is filled with billions of stars.

367
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,905
That's just the soda straw,

368
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,996
and now you imagine the whole sky

369
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:16,119
filled with thousands upon thousands

370
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,582
upon thousands of galaxies.

371
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,626
Each of which is billions
of billions of stars.

372
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:22,876
There's a lot of possibility out there.

373
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,428
- If you took a grain of
sand and put it on the table,

374
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,675
and if that were the size of the Sun,

375
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,891
then the earth would
be about an inch away.

376
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:35,262
And it would be microscopic.

377
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,357
And the entire solar
system would fit on a table

378
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:38,691
six feet across.

379
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,854
Think about the next star.

380
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:42,897
The next star would be
another grain of sand.

381
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:44,941
How far away from that solar system

382
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:46,316
would you have to put that?

383
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:50,032
And it turns out to be about
seven and a half miles away.

384
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:52,529
It's absolutely remarkable how much space

385
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,575
there is between the stars
and between the planets.

386
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,578
- The distances are almost unfathomable.

387
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,126
These were the fastest spacecraft

388
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:04,499
that had ever been built
and launched and flown,

389
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,968
and they're travelling

390
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:07,883
at 10 miles per second.

391
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,344
You wouldn't even see it, right?

392
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:12,841
And yet, even at those

393
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,553
unfathomable by Earth standard speeds,

394
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,555
it takes decades,

395
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:22,732
decades to get out there
into the outer solar system.

396
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,520
- We don't have any problem putting

397
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,896
the spacecraft through the Asteroid Belt

398
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,319
and yet at one time people think god

399
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,444
that you were gonna
crash into an asteroid.

400
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:34,160
There's not very much chance
of crashing into an asteroid.

401
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:36,374
It's just a lot of room out there.

402
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,537
A lot of room.

403
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,544
- If you wanna realise
how empty our galaxy is,

404
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,829
the nearest galaxy to
our own is Andromeda,

405
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,082
it's about two million light years away.

406
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,833
It's on a collision
course with us right now.

407
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,879
And in five billion years

408
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,967
that galaxy's going to
collide with our own.

409
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,384
And you might say, oh, no, oh, no,

410
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:52,802
but it turns out,

411
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,473
space is, even in our galaxy,
it's mostly empty space.

412
00:18:56,474 --> 00:18:58,595
When our two galaxies collide,

413
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,190
almost no stars will hit any other star.

414
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,266
It's mostly empty space.

415
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,315
So Voyager is likely
to continue throughout

416
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,729
our galaxy for potentially millions

417
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,858
or maybe even billions of
years without a collision.

418
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:16,279
- I have a hard time with really
long geological timeframes.

419
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,033
You just can't get your hands around how

420
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,503
10s of millions of years,
what that really means.

421
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:25,497
And distances, astronomical distances.

422
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,338
- Yeah, once you start getting
into the astronomical scales,

423
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,210
our solar system is pretty tiny,

424
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,754
and so this adventure of Voyager

425
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,674
which seems so remote and distant

426
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,176
for this little spacecraft to go out

427
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,846
to the giant planets is
really just exploring

428
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,849
the tiniest closest neighbourhood

429
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,694
when you start thinking
about cosmic scales.

430
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:49,781
(STATIC)

431
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,119
- The spacecraft were built

432
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,786
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

433
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:02,456
It's a federal research centre

434
00:20:02,457 --> 00:20:06,581
that's part of Cal-Tech
and they build spacecraft.

435
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,628
One of the things I just admire most

436
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:11,671
about the engineers who built Voyager

437
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:13,342
is that they're always thinking about

438
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:16,339
the most improbable things happening.

439
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,340
You know, you want to take those people

440
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,508
on a camping trip with you

441
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,556
because they will think of.

442
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:20,891
Well, you've got to bring,

443
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:22,011
what if these bugs come out,

444
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,226
what if the tent gets flooded,

445
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:24,893
what if you run out of gas,

446
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:26,891
what if you can't start
the fire, you know.

447
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,438
They're the what if people.

448
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:31,527
And when you're sending
something out into space

449
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:33,240
you can't go do a service call,

450
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,858
you can't bring it back,

451
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,192
so your what if list

452
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,570
had better be like that long

453
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,740
or you're not going to be able to survive.

454
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,835
(STATIC)

455
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,247
- These projects begin

456
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,459
with a conceptualization period.

457
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,880
How feasible is it for
us to do thus and so?

458
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,304
We didn't know what the
spacecraft was gonna look like.

459
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,974
How do we arrange a spacecraft?

460
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:05,513
How do we take the communications system,

461
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,350
this large 12-foot diameter fixed antenna,

462
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,730
and arrange it relative
to the propulsion system?

463
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,110
The spacecraft took on the
dimension of being a child,

464
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:20,612
and our design teams, you know,
were like kind of parents.

465
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,365
This was actually a nurturing process.

466
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,950
Bringing that child,

467
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,124
if you will, into reality.

468
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,378
- All spacecraft were made
basically of the same things.

469
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:36,716
Silicon and aluminium, that's about it.

470
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:38,463
You know, that's probably 95% of it.

471
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,387
Silicon and aluminium is cheap

472
00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:44,260
until you start making
stuff out if it, you know.

473
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,137
- The spacecraft of
course is quite primitive

474
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,230
by modern day standards.

475
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:49,682
We have three computers on board.

476
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,893
Their total memory is about,

477
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,730
240,000 times less than
in your smartphone.

478
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,280
- 1972 was when you had
the technology freeze.

479
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:00,109
Remember we launched in 77.

480
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,450
So you freeze technology
several years earlier,

481
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:05,198
and at the time the biggest
computers in the world

482
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,038
were comparable to the kinds of things

483
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,785
we have in our pockets today.

484
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,005
And I'm not talking about a cell phone.

485
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:13,790
I'm actually talking about a key fob.

486
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,418
- What's wrong with 70s technology?

487
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:20,129
I mean, you're looking at me,
I'm a 30s technology, right?

488
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,676
I don't apologise for the limitations

489
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:23,972
that we were working with at the time.

490
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:28,888
We milked the technology for
what we could get from it.

491
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,307
- Voyager is about 800 kilogrammes.

492
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,269
It's main antenna is 12 feet in diameter,

493
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,396
which was the largest we could launch.

494
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,364
- There's this body,

495
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:40,608
this 10 sided can called the bus,

496
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,488
and that's got all the
electronics and the computers.

497
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:45,032
And that's got these arms and

498
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,744
these appendages that stick out.

499
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:49,205
It has these feet that
connected it to the rocket

500
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:50,872
and then a really long arm

501
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:53,166
with a magnetic field
sensor on it over here

502
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:56,210
and another arm over there with
this plutonium power supply

503
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:57,375
to give it its electricity.

504
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,719
You can't keep that too
close to the spacecraft

505
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,712
because it will radiate the spacecraft.

506
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,465
And another arm with this device

507
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,510
that had the cameras and
other instruments on it

508
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:06,761
that could point around,
kind of like the eyes,

509
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,221
adn the big antenna was the ears.

510
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,061
When everything is fully extended

511
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:13,855
to its greatest dimensions,

512
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:18,187
it's comparable in size to
sort of a small school bus.

513
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,523
It really is graceful,

514
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,526
despite the kind of gangly appearance.

515
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,487
A strange-looking being for our planet,

516
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,615
but perfectly happy in space.

519
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,649
- I became the producer of
only one record in my career,

520
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,737
and only two copies of it were made,

521
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:03,653
and they were both hurled off the earth,

522
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,745
so I don't know if that's
a credential or not.

(RECORD SCRATCHING)

524
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,035
The launch window for Voyager was set.

525
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:11,953
It had to do with an alignment
of the outer planets.

526
00:24:11,954 --> 00:24:13,669
You have to launch in that window.

527
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,247
And they sure as hell weren't
going to wait for the record.

528
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,208
- We had six weeks to do it.

529
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,548
And when I talk about the record

530
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:24,253
I think that's what always
draws the biggest gasp.

531
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,505
That you had to figure out a way

532
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,095
to explain the world to aliens,

533

- There were outbursts of joy.

714
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,693
We were on our way.

715
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,611
- And then we launched it

716
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,365
and then other things went crazy.

717
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,960
The spacecraft began to do things

718
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:55,454
that we had no expectation
that it would have done.

719
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,248
- Us poor people on Earth,

720
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,917
we're like "What is it doing?"

721
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,841
- And as the launch vehicle
leaves the launchpad,

722
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:04,258
it has to roll through a certain angle

723
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,096
to get to the right
direction for departure.

724
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:09,764
And the rate that it rolls
at is a much higher rate

725
00:32:09,765 --> 00:32:12,977
than the spacecraft would ever
normally experience flying.

726
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,771
And so the gyro hits the stops.

727
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:16,142
It saturates.

728
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,732
- Voyager was not in control of itself.

729
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:19,478
It's just riding this big rocket,

730
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,230
and that was shaking it in such a way

731
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,357
that it thought it was failing,

732
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,573
and so it started switching
off various boxes,

733
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:26,777
changing to the back-up this,

734
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,778
to the back-up that.

735
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,326
Trying to figure out why all
this stuff was happening.

736
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,413
- For a couple of days
it was a real nail-biter.

737
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:33,748
People were asking us,

738
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:34,994
"Have you lost the spacecraft"

739
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,996
and we would say "We don't know for sure,"

740
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,582
because we didn't know for sure.

741
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,793
- And the headline read “Mutiny in Space...

742
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,715
The Voyager spacecraft had decided

743
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:47,053
it just didn't want to
follow the instructions

744
00:32:47,054 --> 00:32:49,013

745
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:51,556

what it wanted to do.

who had written that code

747
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:56,765
was able to say "This is okay.

748
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,437
"It's doing this, it tried that,

749
00:32:58,438 --> 00:32:59,812

750
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,480

753
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:08,819

- The limits were set simply too tight.

757
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,242
It needed to be able

758
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,204
to wiggle more and vibrate more.

759
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:21,300
And the telemetry length wasn't gonna

760
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,793
be a solid as people expected.

761
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,170
So all of those things

762
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,923
that had caused issues with Voyager Two

763
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,677
then were solved for Voyager One.

768
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,606
we're thinking everything's okay.

769
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:42,273
And then we begin to hear this,

770
00:33:42,274 --> 00:33:44,318
we call it chatter over
the launch vehicle net

771
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,440
that something wasn't right.

772
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,818
- I looked over at him and he looked like

773
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:48,862
he was a little worried.

774
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,574
And I said "What's the matter, Charley?"

775
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:51,822
And he says "I don't know,

776
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:55,074
"I don't think we're going
to make it, you know."

777
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,951
There was a leak in the propellant line,

778
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,829
and we were losing propellant overboard.

779
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,454
So while it was burning,

780
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,456
propellant was escaping
from the launch vehicle.

781
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,175
And that's why second stage never got

782
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,918
to deliver its full thrust

783
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,590
because it ran out of fuel.

784
00:34:07,591 --> 00:34:09,885
- And so the upper which was a Centaur,

785
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:12,383
liquid, hydrogen, and oxygen stage

786
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,009
had to make up for that.

787
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,224
- And the Centaur is the stage

788
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:16,559
that's doing the guidance.

789
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,774
So the Centaur knows
that it's not reaching

790
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:20,266
the required velocity.

791
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,310
And when it separates
from the second stage

792
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,109
it knows it has to burn longer

793
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,147
to add more velocity.

794
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,150
- The Centaur, to achieve parking orbit,

795
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,904
had to use 1,200 pounds
of extra propellant.

796
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,157
Now we're all thinking,

797
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:37,250
is it going to have
enough left in the tanks

798
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:39,201
to make a normal injection?

799
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,330
Or is it going to run out of fuel?

800
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,789
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

801
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,376
Fortunately, it had
three and a half seconds

802
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,927
of thrusting left before it
had run to fuel depletion.

803
00:34:50,928 --> 00:34:52,923
Three and a half seconds,

804
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,010
so Voyager One just barely made it.

805
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,228
- It wouldn't have gotten enough velocity

806
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,762
to get to Jupiter, you know.

807
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,481
So instead of getting
to Jupiter, you know,

808
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:02,062
we'd have gotten almost to Jupiter

809
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,976
and then we'd come back toward the Sun,

810
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,102
which would not have been good.

00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:13,225
And as we would get closer and closer,

891
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,945
the images became more dramatic.

892
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,111
- [NARRATOR] Incredibly
strange, and beautiful,

893
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:23,283
and now by Voyager revealed
in all of it's splendour.

894
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,665
- [NARRATOR] We were trying to get as much

895
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,199
detail as possible.

896
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,955
So a narrow angle camera
was 1500 millimetres

897
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,634
and the wide angle camera
was 200 millimetres.

898
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,088
- Would someone care to speculate

899
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:42,507
what you would say to Galileo Galilei

900
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,631
if he walked into the room today?

901
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,474
(FAINT LAUGHTER)

902
00:39:45,475 --> 00:39:47,968
- How are you able to live so long?

903
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,188
(LAUGHTER)

904
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,517
- I think Galileo.

905
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,441
- Jupiter is more than 10
times the diameter of earth.

906
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:58,687
It's huge!

907
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,940
And it's mainly hydrogen and helium.

908
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,815
There are no solid
surface on these planets.

909
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,527
These planets are liquid
gas and liquid deep inside.

910
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,122
- The gas is compressed
the farther down you go

911
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:10,458
and it gets very hot indeed.

912
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,620
You would melt, vaporise in fact,

913
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,539
if you tried to fly through Jupiter.

914
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,416
- Let me first modify your statement.

915
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,509
Not that it was wrong.

916
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,502
- The atmospheric scientists

917
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,177
got long-range views
because we weren't looking

918
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:29,176
at tiny moons, we were
looking at the big planet,

919
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,053
and so we could see things going on

920
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,556
before the other groups could see things.

921
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,437
And we were always the
first to start shouting.

922
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:43,815
- [NARRATOR] Even to this day
we don't fly colour detectors.

923
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,984
You get a much higher-resolution

924
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,736
image in black and white.

925
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,529
And so when we want to make colour,

926
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,998
we take them through different filters

927
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:52,741
and then on the ground you put it together

928
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,619
and make a colour image out of it.

929
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,873
- That acceleration as
you're approaching encounters

930
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:00,290
is really something that
becomes very, very exciting.

931
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,337
We called it drinking out
of a fire hose, you know,

932
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:03,587
you're trying to take a little sip,

933
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:06,055
and this torrent of data is coming out.

934
00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:08,715
(FAST PACED MUSIC)

935
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,218
- You go to Jupiter and you
have a storm that's been

936
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,220
around for more than 300 years,

937
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,894
that's the Great Red Spot.

938
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:18,141
You could fit two or
three Earths inside it.

939
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,860
So here's the Great Red
Spot and here's an earth

940
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:21,561
and here's an earth.

941
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,814
It's always going around.

942
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:27,401
And I sort of assumed that the flow around

943
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,486
these giant things would be

944
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,655
smooth like honey.

945
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,200
But, when Voyager started
getting close-up images,

946
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,619
we realised that it was very active.

947
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,621
And that deepened the mystery

948
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,541
of how these big storms could even exist

949
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,634
with all this

950
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,670
turbulence going on.

951
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,549
- It was swallowing up clouds
and spitting out others.

952
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,843
We knew that it was a vortex,

953
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,063
but to see it in action...

954
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,433
- [NARRATOR] Every day you're wondering

955
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,061
"Did we build the spacecraft well enough?

"Did we anticipate all the possible things

957
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:05,239
"that could go wrong?"

958
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,198
- Pioneer 10 had to measure
the radiation environment

959
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,361
which was much greater than our

960
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,739
earth based interpretation suggested.

this monster essentially.

this monster radiation
environment on purpose,

965
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,170
because you need to get close

966
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,639
because you want to see
all the little moons,

967
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,381
and the clouds, and the storms,

968
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,759
and you want to slingshot on to Saturn.

969

But you just don't know if
you're going to survive.

970
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,272
Thing gets fried, you lose the mission.

971

Still out there physically
intact probably,

972
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:44,019
but unable to communicate
with it, the mission's over.

973
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,606
- Two months before shipping
to the Cape for launch,

974
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,775
the scientists were predicting

975
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,861
that the magnetic fields around Jupiter

976
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,455
were intense enough that they

977
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:57,365
would accelerate particles.

978
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,869
Whoa, we were hearing
initially 40,000 volts,

979
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,081
that would be the end of our spacecraft.

980
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:07,125
Cabling on these
appendages were conductors

981
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,220
that would take these destroying pulses

982
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:12,964
and just feed them right
into our systems and kill us,

983
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,809
so we needed to ground everything.

984
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,599
We didn't have time

985
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,305
to go through the normal design reviews,

986
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,099
so in order to get this

987
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,101
protection done quickly enough,

988
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,770
<i>an ad hoe team was formed</i>

989
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,115
and we did some things that
were out of the ordinary,

990
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:31,775
very out of the ordinary.

991
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,995
I can remember asking
one of the technicians

992
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:36,705
to go out and buy aluminium foil.

993
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,167
It was the only material
that was available to us.

994
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:43,537
Normally our procurement of spacecraft

995
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:47,293
hardware supplies,
materials, are a much more

996
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,803
sophisticated process.

00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,635
We're all in bunny suits actually

998
00:43:53,636 --> 00:43:55,924
cutting continuous strips

999
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:59,386
and then cleaning them
with wipes and alcohol.

1000
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,981
And then finally wrapping these on all of

00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,728
But yeah, same materials
in your Christmas turkey.

1003
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,151
I don't think we created
any shortage per se.

1004
00:44:11,152 --> 00:44:13,026
It may have been a local shortage

1005
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:15,699
in the local grocery store for a few days

1006
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,737

You don't expect the molecules up in the

1015
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:45,640

But in a plasma, in this radiation belt,

1017
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,230
that can happen.

of antennas on your ears

know, kind of the showstopper

1069
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:54,019
for Voyager, we get to Io.

1070

- [NARRATOR] Io, of course,

1071
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:56,363
Io was the star of the show

1072
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:58,106
and we didn't learn that

1073
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,280
until after the encounter.

1074
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,329
- [NARRATOR] Everyone had gone home,

1075
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,740
and Linda Morabito, an engineer whose job

1076
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,867
was to find out the positioning

1077
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,586
and the orbit of the spacecraft,

1078
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:13,457
noticed some bumps on images of Io.

1079
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,458
- I was on the mission

1080
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,668
as a mission navigator,

1081
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,629
and our job involved just looking back

1082
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,299
over the shoulder of the spacecraft

1083
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,804
to say, "Okay, one more picture
of the realm of Jupiter."

1084
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:30,805
So it wasn't high-priority work.

1085
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,850
- It was an optical navigation image,

1086
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,606
and Linda saw this
strange thing on the limb.

1087
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:42,609
- An enormous object emerged, enormous.

1088
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,830
And the first thing I said
to myself, "What is that?!"

1089
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:49,542
And I'm like it looks
like another satellite

1090
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:54,746

1094
00:47:59,886 --> 00:48:02,379
it was sufficiently large.

1095
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,922
I felt with certainty,

1096
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,011
it's the only thing I knew,

1097
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:08,637
that I was seeing something
that had never been seen before.

1098
00:48:08,638 --> 00:48:11,389

1099

1100

on a world beyond the Earth.

1106
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:37,544
- It was so hard to
believe that a little moon

1107
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:39,668
could have 10 times the
volcanic activity of Earth,

1108
00:48:39,669 --> 00:48:41,418

1110
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,676
And then there's Io.

1111
00:48:44,677 --> 00:48:47,048
Suddenly we had realised

1112
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,467
this was a different journey we were on.

1113

He's about 12 million years old,

our Sun is four and a
half billion years old.

1331
00:58:55,121 --> 00:58:56,660
There are many stars that are a lot older.

1332
00:58:56,661 --> 00:58:58,001
Therefore you could have imagined some

1333
00:58:58,002 --> 00:58:59,789

Well, over that last four
and a half billion years,

1337
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:06,917
the only evidence of intelligent life

1338
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,511
would have been in the last 50 or 60 years

even if someone told
you look at that star,

1343
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:17,807
and then look at the
third rock from that star,

1344
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:18,929
and that's where you're
going to find life.

1415
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:58,779
- [NARRATOR] The largest moon of Saturn,

1416
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:01,153
Titan's the most extraordinary place.

1417
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:03,821
There's a dense methane atmosphere

1418
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:06,325
where a complex organic
chemistry has been going on

1419
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:07,917
for perhaps billions of years,

1420
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:12,830
and we are in a moment of
extraordinary discovery.

1421
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,129
- We had both spacecraft programmed

1422
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,584
to do identical missions at Saturn,

1423
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,258
and that was the prime mission

1424
01:03:19,259 --> 01:03:21,097
and it involved Titan.

1425
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,592
- There's a huge amount
amount of scientific interest

1426
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:25,217
in Titan because many people think

1427
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,513
that early in our own history,

1428
01:03:26,514 --> 01:03:28,184
our own planet may have been like that

1429
01:03:28,185 --> 01:03:31,557
with very little oxygen,
lots of hydrocarbons,

1430
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:34,435
very thick, different, smoggy atmosphere

1431
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,938
that was changed dramatically
on our planet by life.

1432
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,690
So if you want to understand
the starting conditions,

1433
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:40,908
go study Titan.

1434
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,657
- [NARRATOR] If Voyager One
was successful at Titan,

1435
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:47,908
Voyager Two, which is nine
months behind going to Saturn,

1436
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:49,908
would be free to continue to

1437
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,660
Uranus and to go on to Neptune.

1438
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:55,748
But it depended upon Voyager
One succeeding at Titan.

1439
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,049
- Because Voyager One had
to be in a certain place

1440
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,794
in order to pass Titan,

1441
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,342
it couldn't go on to Uranus and Neptune.

1442
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:05,217
There was just no way
to bend its trajectory

1443
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:06,889
to go anywhere else.

1444
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,764
- Voyager Two would have
done exactly that same thing

1445
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,932
if Voyager One had failed.

1446
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,812
We would have gone like
this, no more planets.

1447
01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:18,400
- That would have been really tough.

1448
01:04:18,401 --> 01:04:20,194
You gonna try for Titan again

1449
01:04:20,195 --> 01:04:24,693
and give up two other
worlds, Uranus and Neptune?

1450
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:29,615
- [NARRATOR] So there was a
lot of pressure on Voyager One.

1451
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:30,741
- Mostly what we looked at

1452
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:33,827
was a giant ball of brown smog

1453
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,753
with some sort of electric
blue hazes above it.

1454
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,089
- With the Voyager camera,

1455
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:43,504
you couldn't see through
the clouds and haze.

1456
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,224
(RADIO CHATTER)

1457
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:52,096
Now the radio signal from the spacecraft

1458
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,769
passed through the
atmosphere of the planet,

1459
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,313
and that gave them a measure

1460
01:04:56,314 --> 01:04:58,435
of the pressure at the surface

1461
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,732
and also the temperature at the surface.

1462
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:02,323
And so we learned a lot about

1463
01:05:02,324 --> 01:05:05,442
Titan from that radio signal.

1464
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,194
- [NARRATOR] Titan did not reveal itself

1465
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:08,991
to the camera's of the Voyager.

1466
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:11,240
But the spectrometers and radio science

1467
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,992
made major contributions to the chemistry

1468
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,918
and physics of the
atmosphere and the interior.

1469
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,253
- [NARRATOR] We had gathered what we could

1470
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,338
with Voyager spacecraft.

1471
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,307
- [NARRATOR] There was little to be gained

1472
01:05:28,308 --> 01:05:31,260
by doing another close flyby of Titan.

1473
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,678
- Shortly after that,

1474
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:33,974
NASA Headquarters agreed

1475
01:05:33,975 --> 01:05:35,940
that we should continue with Voyager Two

1476
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:37,724
on it's Uranus trajectory.

1477
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,103
So Voyager One had succeeded.

1478
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,197
- People don't realise
how we almost didn't

1479
01:05:43,198 --> 01:05:45,441
have that mission to Uranus and Neptune.

1480
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,240
We almost didn't have the Grand Tour

1481
01:05:47,241 --> 01:05:50,904
if not for the success
for Voyager One at Titan.

1482
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:54,199
- Voyager One was done
and was receding from

1483
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,294
the solar system at an angle above the

1484
01:05:56,295 --> 01:05:58,038
plain of the planets.

1485
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,799
- So Voyager One planetary mission almost

1486
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,293
ended right there.

1487
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,295
Come back to that later.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

1489
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,016
We're getting pictures and other data

1490
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:20,356
back from Voyager Two.

1491
01:06:20,357 --> 01:06:21,727
But at some point in time,

1492
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,524
it had to go behind the planet

1493
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:25,567
and that blocks us from getting

1494
01:06:25,568 --> 01:06:27,361
radio signals to the earth.

1495
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:29,452
And that happened to be in
the middle of the night.

1496
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:31,737
It appeared at times several hours

1497

that everybody knows we're gonna be out

1498
01:06:32,991 --> 01:06:34,785

Everybody's expecting
to pop champagne corks

1500
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,586
and say "Hey we made it and all the data's

"on the tape recorder."

we can start debriefing.

1516
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,913
I wanted to make a very brief statement.

1517
01:07:17,914 --> 01:07:20,788
We do have a problem onboard
the Voyager Two spacecraft.

1518
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:22,376
- The spacecraft has a problem.

sure we understand where

1522
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,378
we're headed if the following instruments

01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,218
are mounted on the platform.

1528
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,605
the darkest day of the whole mission.

1529
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:45,602
- [NARRATOR] There is
circumstantial evidence.

1530
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,856
- [NARRATOR] I came into the auditorium,

1531
01:07:47,857 --> 01:07:51,858
and there was just gloom
on everybody's face.

1532
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,610
- You're beginning to speculate.

1533
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:56,530
- I quickly learned what had happened.

1534
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,909
The scan platform had frozen.

1535
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,294
- [NARRATOR] We were
moving our scan platform

1536
01:08:01,295 --> 01:08:02,744
all over the sky.

1537
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,997
And we're actually going as fast

1538
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,165
as it could possibly go.

1539
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,334
- A frozen scan platform

1540
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,179
could be a fatal, crippling event.

(SOLEMN MUSIC)

1542
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,188
- The rest of the Saturn mission,

1543
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:23,933
and Uranus and Neptune were dead.

1544
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:29,152
And seeing everything that
we were planning just gone,

1545
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,441
just suddenly gone.

1546
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,113
- The problem is not with the camera,

1547
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:36,031
it's with the articulated platform

1548
01:08:36,032 --> 01:08:37,863
that moves all of the instruments.

1549
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,116
Our camera is, as far as we know,

1550
01:08:39,117 --> 01:08:40,198
are working just fine.

1551
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,792
It's just that we're
taking lots of pictures

1552
01:08:41,793 --> 01:08:43,036
of black space.

1553
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,918
- All of the science
that we had hoped to do,

1554
01:08:45,919 --> 01:08:48,624
and Uranus and Neptune, there
were no other spacecraft

1555
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:49,842
that were going to be going there.

1556
01:08:49,843 --> 01:08:51,379
It was up to Voyager to do it,

1557
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,342
and all of a sudden it
looked as though Voyager

1558
01:08:53,343 --> 01:08:54,840
was not going to do it.

1559
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:57,092
It was devastating, it was.

1560
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,056
- [NARRATOR] It took a
couple of days while the

1561
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:08,018
engineering team went to
work diagnosing the problem.

1562
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,397
- [NARRATOR] We are going
to command an azimuth slew

1563
01:09:10,398 --> 01:09:12,648
and an elevation slew

1564
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,358
to the Saturn position.

1565
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,948
- It turns out the scan platform

1566
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:17,819
has small motors to rotate it,

1567
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,446
and we could run it at slow speed.

1568
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:20,869
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

1569
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:23,742
Fast medium speed or very fast.

1570
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,871
We were of course wanting
to look at lots of places,

1571
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:28,339
so we had the thing
looking lots of places,

1572
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:32,876
and the lubrication wasn't
adequate and it just jammed.

1573
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,754
- It was frozen sort of like a car

1574
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:37,798
stuck in the snow.

1575
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,675
You try to go forward
or backward little bit

1576
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,886
and keep working on it
and try to get it out,

1577
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:44,388
and that's what we did
with the scan platform.

1578
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:47,104
We would try to push it a
little bit in one direction

1579
01:09:47,105 --> 01:09:48,558
and it would yield a little bit,

1580
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,232
and then we'd push it
in the other direction,

1581
01:09:50,233 --> 01:09:51,942
and it would yield a little bit more,

1582
01:09:51,943 --> 01:09:53,110
and then we kept doing that

1583
01:09:53,111 --> 01:09:55,315
back and forth, back and forth.

1584
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,526
And finally that was enough

1585
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,701
to get the lubrication into the gears.

1586
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,365
- It was freed up

1587
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,834
and back came the spacecraft,

1588
01:10:04,835 --> 01:10:07,160
and back came the imaging system,

1589

The mathematical structure
of a straight pop song

The mathematical structure of a Bach Fugue

that depicts our civilization.

But we only had the ability
to do about 100 pictures,

1655

that was as much data as we could send.

So that was kind of hard.

to put some pictures of

01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:15,617
to show just what our
anatomy was really like.

1667
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:19,079
NASA had been seriously criticised

1668
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,039
about the Pioneer plaque.

1669
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,667
There were actually letters
to the editors of newspapers

saying that NASA was
sending smut to space.

1671
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,053
How are we going to show pictures of

1672
01:14:30,054 --> 01:14:33,551
naked humans without it looking salacious?

1673
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,395
And the answer to that was why don't

1674
01:14:35,396 --> 01:14:38,060
you put a pregnant woman in the picture.

1675
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:41,436
Because pregnant women are
not considered salacious.

1676
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:44,104
Not appealing sexually.

1677
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:46,189

yet visited by a spacecraft.

1686
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:08,137
And it's so remote it was not even known

1687
01:15:08,138 --> 01:15:09,504
until 200 years ago.

1688
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,047
And it's a great distance out there

1689
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,391
and if we launch directly from earth

1690
01:15:12,392 --> 01:15:14,300
it would have taken 30 years to get there.

1691
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,894

that could be reprogrammed.

1710
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,524
They could take what was on the computer

1711
01:16:01,525 --> 01:16:02,640
and just wipe it away

1712
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:05,235
and give it a whole new set of software.

1713
01:16:05,236 --> 01:16:07,353
They trained the spacecraft to

1714
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,564
pirouette like a ballet dancer.

1715
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,533
Basically you want to take
a picture of that thing

1716
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:13,198
and it's going past you really fast,

1717
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:16,196
so you spin the whole spacecraft

1718
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,615
and follow it like this.

1719
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:21,037
And so even though it was darker at Uranus

1720
01:16:21,038 --> 01:16:22,624
and really dark at Neptune,

1721
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:25,373
you could leave the shutter
open without smearing,

You're telling me you can't see it.

I can.

1769
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:27,577
- Dr. Soderblom,

1770
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:28,873
as you whizzed through your explanation,

1771
01:18:28,874 --> 01:18:30,043
I couldn't put it all together,

1772
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:32,916
could you try that again?

1773
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:33,759
- Slower?

1774
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,261
- Slower and a few more details.

1775
01:18:36,262 --> 01:18:39,006
- I thought that was pretty slow.

1776
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,343
- Every time we arrived at a new planet

1777
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:44,311
there were always surprises

1778
01:18:44,312 --> 01:18:46,349
even though we had gotten a lot smarter.

1779
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:47,849
For instance, before Voyager,

1780
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,270
all the magnetic fields

1781
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:51,351
have the magnetic pole near

1782
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:53,228
the rotation axis of the planet,

1783
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,354
and that was true for Jupiter,

1784
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:55,857
it was true for Saturn.

1785
01:18:55,858 --> 01:18:57,699
And then we flew by Uranus and

1786
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,568
the pole was near the equator.

1787
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,821
- There's been a lot of speculation

1788
01:19:01,822 --> 01:19:04,030
about the magnetosphere of Uranus.

1789
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:04,953
Would there be one,

1790
01:19:04,954 --> 01:19:06,699
what would it be like?

1791
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,122
And the magnetosphere of Uranus

1792
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:11,079
is far more weird and wonderful.

1793
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,748
We found the planet tipped on it's side,

1794
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,089
but the magnetic field is then tipped

1795
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,758
relative to the spin axis.

1796
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:21,256
So you have this huge contortion

1797
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,509
in the magnetic field

1798
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:25,385
as the planet spins around.

1799
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:26,928
Just bizarre.

1800
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,933
Why on earth the magnetic
field was so messed up,

1801
01:19:29,934 --> 01:19:31,149
we had no idea.

1802
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:36,147
- At the time the Voyager
Two spacecraft flew by Uranus

1803
01:19:36,148 --> 01:19:39,857
one pole of the planet
was pointing at the Sun.

1804
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:41,776
At that point in it's orbit,

1805
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,320
it's atmosphere shuts down.

1806
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,791
So the planet itself didn't look exciting.

1807
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,579
And part of that is Uranus itself

1808
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,999
holding it's secrets back.

1809
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,174
- That had to be, I guess, one of the,

1810

1811
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:06,139
was not more photogenic than it was.

1812
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,433

Uranus for gravity assist.

- Nobody was ready for Miranda.

1846
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:37,934
- In parts there were
enormous cliffs and gashes

1847

in which fault blocks had dropped down.

1848
01:21:40,405 --> 01:21:43,773

see the edge of a cliff

the edge of that cliff,

1943
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:45,810
"what's the universe made
of, how will it end?"

1944
01:25:45,811 --> 01:25:47,024
All of these basic questions

1945
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:50,112
are the questions that drive science.

1946
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:54,990
I do cosmology, I study the beginning

1947
01:25:54,991 --> 01:25:56,405
and end of the universe
and sometimes people say,

1948
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:57,652
"What's that good for?"

1949
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,246
And I always say to them,
"You don't ask what's a

1950
01:25:59,247 --> 01:26:00,910
"Mozart symphony good for?

1951
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:02,740
"Or a Picasso painting.“

1952
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,617
But science somehow seems in order to be

1953
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:06,746
useful for people it has
to produce technology.

1954
01:26:06,747 --> 01:26:10,873
But the beautiful thing
about science is the ideas.

1955
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,542
From a child you ask your parents why.

1956
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:14,919
But when you grow up you finally realise

1957
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,673
that what you really mean is how.

1958
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,759
Einstein has told us that
us that space and time

1959
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,427
are tied together.

1960
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:26,263
Integrally, we live in a space time.

1961
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,265
If our universe came into beings

1962
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:31,315
and space popped into
existence, then so did time.

1963
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:34,230
And so time itself may not have existed

1964
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:35,778
literally before the big bang.

1965
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:37,483
So there was no before.

1966
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:39,578
And that seems crazy, because
if there was no before,

1967
01:26:39,579 --> 01:26:41,195
all these ideas of cause and effect

1968
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,491
et cetera go out the window.

1969
01:26:42,492 --> 01:26:44,867
But all it means is that
we'll have to change

1970
01:26:44,868 --> 01:26:46,617
the way we understand things.

(SLOW PACED MUSIC)

1972
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,791
Another possibility is that our Big Bang

1973
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,543
is just one of an infinite
number of Big Bang's

1974
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:59,547
that are occurring in what
we now call a multiverse.

1975
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,841
It's an amazing change of view

1976
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:04,138
which makes us yet even
more insignificant.

1977
01:27:04,139 --> 01:27:05,932
We were insignificant enough travelling

1978
01:27:05,933 --> 01:27:07,555
around the Sun in the middle of nowhere

1979
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,228
around a random galaxy
amongst 100 billion galaxies,

1980
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:12,353
but now we know that
even the whole universe

1981
01:27:12,354 --> 01:27:15,604
that we call home may
just be an insignificant

1982
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:18,484
something in the midst
of something much bigger.

1983
01:27:18,485 --> 01:27:20,484
The history of science is to remove us

1984
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:24,115
ever further from the centre
of the universe if you wish.

1985
01:27:24,116 --> 01:27:26,458

there was no capability to get

That capability happened all after launch.

2004
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,994
It involved reprogramming the spacecraft,

2005
01:28:11,995 --> 01:28:14,371
taking two 34-meter antennas

2006
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:16,791
and adding them to a 70-meter antenna.

Saturn, and Uranus, had
sped up the spacecraft too,

You know, in my head imagining
what it might look like

The most surprising thing

2044
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,188
was a giant dark spot.

2045
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:58,142

the rings of Neptune.

is twice as dark as soot,

2085
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:29,024
and the light that's falling on them

2086
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:32,361
is 1,000 times fainter than on Earth.

2087
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,405
So you have one one-thousandth the light

2088
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,828
and you're trying to image something

2089
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:37,497

Well, there was a way.

2107
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:21,326
And the way was to fly
over the north pole,

2108
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:23,079
very close to Neptune

2109
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:27,249
to bend the spacecraft
so it would go down.

2110
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,585
And then intersect Triton.

And they had to hit that,

01:32:41,436 --> 01:32:45,184
that we didn't know enough
about Neptune's atmosphere

2119
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:49,521
to really be sure that the
spacecraft would not tumble.

2120
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,320
It's also possible that
there were particles

2121
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:53,317
in these ring arcs that we might

2122
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:55,652
go through a cloud of shrapnel.

2123
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:57,747
And that would be the
end of the spacecraft

2124
01:32:57,748 --> 01:32:58,956
if We did that.

2125
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,326
- Just a slight error in the calculations

2126
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:04,623
and instead of skimming
across the cloud tops,

2127
01:33:04,624 --> 01:33:06,123
you're skimming into the clouds

2128
01:33:06,124 --> 01:33:08,123
and the spacecraft burns up.

2129
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:09,500
Slight error the other way,

2130
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,629
you go a little too far,
you don't bend enough,

2131
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:13,504
maybe you run right into Triton and crash,

2132
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:15,422
and that's the end of the mission.

2133
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:16,299
You don't have enough time,

2134
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:19,009
you have to make your last best guess,

2135
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,136

2137
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:24,979
It would have been just fascinating

2138
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:27,564
to be hanging on to
that spacecraft, right?

2139
01:33:27,565 --> 01:33:28,903
Skimming over these beautiful

2140
01:33:28,904 --> 01:33:31,355
blue cloud tops of Neptune.

2141
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:33,529
And then as you come
over the pole of Neptune

of where we needed to be,

2147
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,751
it's just absolutely remarkable.

here we go again.

As we flew past,

2154
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:08,934
we were able to look down

2155
01:34:08,935 --> 01:34:13,230
at markings on the
surface of the polar cap.

2156
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:14,653

a mosaic of Triton's globe,

2158
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:21,613
but we couldn't get things
to line up quite right.

2159
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:22,739
Some of the dark streaks,

2160
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:25,409

Red and blue glasses.

2170

And the images fused into
a three-dimensional model

2171
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,811

just a frozen cinder.

2184
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,360
The last place we would have expected

2185
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:39,775
to see further dynamics, further eruptions

was at a moon this remote
in the solar system.

above absolute zero.

2189
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:50,869
So there's solar driven geysers

on a satellite that's 30
astronomical units from the Sun.

Who would have thought?

2192
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:00,679
- Just because in idea is crazy

2193
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,299
it's not necessarily wrong.

2194
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,715

2195
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:06,134
- We knew this was the last planet,

Voyager would explore before it headed on

01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,223
for the rest of its journey.

2198
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:14,601
And so I think the times
together as a team,

2199
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:17,025
the times to look at the pictures, talk,

2200
01:36:17,026 --> 01:36:19,523
meet together, became more precious.

2201
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:23,485
- I was passing by the secretary's desk

2202
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:25,739
and she said, "Oh,
Candy, there's a reporter

2203
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:28,156
"that wants to talk to you.“

2204
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:31,243

And he said “How does that make you feel?"

2209
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:50,187
And in that moment, I
dissolved into tears.

2210
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:52,806
- After the spacecraft went past,

2211
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:54,024
it turned around and looked back,

2212
01:36:54,025 --> 01:36:57,112
and there's this beautiful
crescent Neptune and Triton,

2213
01:36:57,113 --> 01:36:59,855
and people realised that's the end

2214
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:01,820
of the planetary part of Voyager.

2215
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:03,734
That's the last port of call,

2216
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:04,907
the last thing we'll see in our

2217
01:37:04,908 --> 01:37:07,571

2218
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,620
And it went from the
Voyager planetary mission

2219
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:12,826
to the Voyager interstellar mission.

2220
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,545
- Of all the images that
was one of the most poignant

2221
01:37:14,546 --> 01:37:17,748
because it was out
goodbye or farewell image.

2222
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:19,708
- We could have

2223
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:21,752
enhanced the colour a bit

2224
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:24,343
to make a somewhat prettier picture but,

2225
01:37:24,344 --> 01:37:26,137
out of respect to the Voyager spacecraft

2226
01:37:26,138 --> 01:37:29,682
we decided to show it
to you just as it is.

2228
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:39,895

2275

have to shut the cameras down,

2277
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:47,355

look back towards the Sun

been taken before.

And there was actually opposition to it.

2283
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:56,656
They just didn't want to do it!

2284
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,033
They couldn't get their heads around

2285
01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:00,249
what would be the point
of taking a picture

2286
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:02,370
of the Earth and Jupiter and so on

2287
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:03,418

So Carl being Carl

01:40:07,585 --> 01:40:09,053
actually went all the way

to the NASA administrator

2292
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:12,839

had been taking selfies

of our planet for as long as

2300
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,652

01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:35,824
No one had ever taken one like this.

2302
01:40:35,825 --> 01:40:38,540
And they ended up on Valentines Day 1990,

2303
01:40:38,541 --> 01:40:41,701
taking this beautiful family portrait.

(BEEPING)

2305
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:48,335
- When we did our portrait
of each of the planets,

2306
01:40:48,336 --> 01:40:50,302
I was the first person
to look at the pictures

2307
01:40:50,303 --> 01:40:52,170
and I knew every blemish,

2308
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:53,842
and so I could pretty quickly go

2309
01:40:53,843 --> 01:40:55,307
blemish, blemish, blemish.

2310
01:40:55,308 --> 01:40:58,093
And I thought, "Well, where's the Earth?"

2311
01:40:58,094 --> 01:41:00,017
How could we, you know?

2312
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:03,723
And then I realised there was a lot of,

2313
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:08,103
there were a lot of streaks
of light in that image,

2314
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:10,146
and I realised finally

2315
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:11,820
that the Earth was sitting

2316
01:41:11,821 --> 01:41:14,285
in one of those rays of light.

2317
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:17,237
You know, I just sat there for a while

2318
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:19,406
just kind of realising

2319
01:41:19,407 --> 01:41:22,075
"Wow, that's the Earth, you know,

2320
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:24,494
“that's Voyager looking
back at the Earth."

2321
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:25,996
And then once I had sort of recovered,

2322
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:27,249
I started calling people.

2323
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,415
I called Brad.

2324
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:29,292
Brad, "We got it."

2325
01:41:29,293 --> 01:41:31,209
Called Carl, “Carl, we got it.“

2326
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,132
Called my dad.

2328
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:35,760
- And so this is a
different kind of milestone

01:41:35,761 --> 01:41:37,757
than the scientific milestones we've had.

2330
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,676

- I'm an imaging scientist,

2332
01:41:40,725 --> 01:41:42,596
so I first realised,
oh, this didn't turn out

2333
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,440
the way we thought it
was going to turn out,

2334
01:41:44,441 --> 01:41:47,267
and my first impulse is to take my hand

2335
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,019
and wipe away the dust,

2336
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,272
because there was some dust on it.

2337
01:41:50,273 --> 01:41:51,944
Well, one of the pieces of dust

2338
01:41:51,945 --> 01:41:55,734
that I wanted to wipe away was the Earth.

2339
01:41:55,735 --> 01:41:58,534
But it didn't matter because
in the hands of Carl,

2340
01:41:58,535 --> 01:42:01,197
he turned it into an allegory

2341
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,491
on the human condition.

2342
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,210

And in this colour picture

2346
01:42:17,553 --> 01:42:21,092

fact less than a pixel,

2347
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:23,219
and this is where we live,

2348
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,013
on a blue dot.

2349
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:26,436
On that blue dot.

underscores our responsibility

2356
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:46,206

Whenever I look up at the night stars,

Voyager is still going to be trucking

2485

out there through the stars,

01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:45,059
any useful information,

2493
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:48,521
that's really the point
at which the Golden Record

2494
01:48:48,522 --> 01:48:50,900

01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:53,109
of those missions.

those records are still floating
