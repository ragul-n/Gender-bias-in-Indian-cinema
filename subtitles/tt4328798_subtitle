00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,774
Then collect your stuff

32
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:16,117
Please sir...sir

33
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,386
Do what I say

34
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:24,304
Shall we complain
in the police station?

35
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,380
We don't stand a chance
We sold all this illegally

36
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,760
How do they act with
 all these contraptions?!

37
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:36,798
Hey Jet!

38
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:37,835
We thrashed them, huh?

39
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:39,295
You thrashed me!

40
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,988
Didn't you tell me
you'd hit me lightly?

41
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:42,218
And you hit me
with a bottle!

42
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:43,139
So sorry, dude

43
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:45,484
I wanted the opening scene
to have a great build up-

44
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:46,906
I went overboard
Doesn't matter

45
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:48,366
I'll buy you a drink
You'll be fine

46
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:49,713
Don't trouble yourself

47
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,134
I flicked this
from the wine shop!

48
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,210
You crafty fox!

49
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:55,938
For the next 2 months

50
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:58,208
Don't show your heads in this area

51
00:04:58,285 --> 00:04:59,707
Off you go

52
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:04,626
Mass, we put in so much effort
and planned brilliantly

53
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:06,395
We got only about 300000 bucks

54
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:08,162
They walked away
with half the loot

55
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:09,661
I'm in tension

56
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:10,777
Don't worry

57
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:13,352
I've already planned
our next heist in millions

58
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,159
Really?

59
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,389
What's my disguise?

60
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:16,734
I won't need a mask, right?

61
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,271
A task beyond any mask!

62
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:26,189
Stop...stop!

63
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,843
- Prince 'anna'
- What, da?

64
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:30,380
A navy boat is
heading towards us

65
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:31,686
Stop your boat
We need to check

66
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:32,801
Go to that damn boat

67
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,069
They'll flee for their lives
if they hear the name 'Reddy'

68
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:36,761
- Stop...!
- Mind your business

69
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,373
Hey! What have you got
smuggled in your boat?

70
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:41,565
Open all the cartons

71
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,296
You know we are Reddy's men

72
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,871
We've given bribes
at the right places

73
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,640
Clear off

74
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,868
How dare you talk to a senior officer
 with such scant respect?

75
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,022
Sir, what shall we do to him?

76
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,367
Reddy 'anna' will get back at you

77
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:52,520
Who cares
Bloody Reddy!

78
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,210
Know how many boats we'd have
checked from Katpadi to Kashmir?

79
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:56,633
Search the boat completely-

80
00:05:56,671 --> 00:06:00,015
(random names of Hindi films)

81
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,244
Search properly
Look inside the cabin

82
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,743
Look here, sir
Bag full of money

83
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,742
What?

84
00:06:07,588 --> 00:06:08,895
Mr Manicka Vinayagam?

85
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,316
Sorry!
Vinayak Mahadevan

86
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:12,469
Check that sack
I can see something moving

87
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:15,660
Sir, officer Arnold

88
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:16,698
Oh God!

89
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:17,582
Officer?

90
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:20,080
Please save me

91
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:23,962
These terrorists tied me up
in a sack and brought me here

92
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,767
Before I die I must do
 something good for our country

93

94
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:35,609
They are trying to escape, sir

95
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:37,915
Dive into the sea

96
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:47,563
Cash...clean sweep!

97
00:06:57,134 --> 00:07:00,017
How could you think
he's a navy officer?

98
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:00,940
No, bro

99
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:03,938

You kept talking about him

151
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,221
He is just behind us

152
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,912
- Move
- I can't

Oh! Nurse, huh?

157
00:11:50,053 --> 00:11:52,553
My throat seems
a little sore from morning

158
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,052
Do you know why-

159
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:54,859
Nothing to worry

160
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:56,050
Must be yesterday's liquor

161
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:57,280
You'll be fine
soon enough

162
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:58,471
Did I talk to you, smarty?

163
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,162
How does one go
to your hospital?

164
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,354
Land up with a disease!

Where is he?

168
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:15,715
Where did they go?

I have an awesome DVD of

and continue walking

174
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,127
I know what to do
Just zip your lips

175
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,550
Hello! How are you?

176
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:36,048
How's your job getting along?

177
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:37,740

Of course not
IT corridor nearby

179
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,468

sense of humor!

- Thanks

181
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:44,158
We are late
Let's go

182
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,811
Hey! Kungfu Panda

183
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:48,079
How is your David?

184
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:49,925
He got caught in
the DVD piracy case

185
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:51,846
Police came over to
his house to question him

186
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,114
Hey! What happened?

187
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,344
Sis, give me a minute
I'll be right back

188
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:56,306
Where are you goin-

189
00:12:56,882 --> 00:12:58,458
Come, my dearest

190
00:12:58,534 --> 00:12:59,610
Isn't your brother David?

191
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:00,534
Yes, bro

192
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,802
This DVD piracy party

193
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,994
Vishal nabbed him

194
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:03,878
He's the one, right?

195
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,224
Don't raise your voice please

196
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,337
Isn't he still in jail?

197
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,605
If they know at the hospital
it will be such a shame, bro

198
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:10,143
Just like a grapefruit
tart and tangy

199
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:11,489
You and your sarcastic digs!

200
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,255
- What's your plan tomorrow?
- Nothing

201
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:17,716
We'll go wherever
you want us to go, bro

202
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,252
Okay

203
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,981
I'll tell you over the phone
tomorrow about your program

204
00:13:22,981 --> 00:13:24,596
Okay, bro
See you

205
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:41,854
Is Kumar there?

206
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:52,041
Why did you want to
come here all of a sudden?

207
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:52,886
Hostel is boring

208
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:56,076
Hiiiiiii!!

209
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:56,807
What a surprise!

210
00:13:56,846 --> 00:13:58,152
You've also come to Theme park

211
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,458
No, there's a temple
for Goddess Shakthi

212
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,304
I thought I should
come here and pray

213
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,148
Weekdays are filled with work

214
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,761
Sunday is one day
for us to do as we please

215
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,799
Be jolly and live it up

216
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:16,217
What, da?

217
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:17,678
Hello?

218
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,215
Do you like this song?

219
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:20,714
How can you even ask me that!

220
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:22,637
I'm a big fan of S.A.Rajkumar!

221
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:24,712
Nowadays music directors
don't come like him!

222
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:25,827
Even I like his music a lot

223
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,095
When I tell this to my firends
they make fun of me

224
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,671
Shows they have
no music sense!

225
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:32,707
Have you heard this song from
 a film with Sharath Kumar as hero?

226
00:14:32,823 --> 00:14:35,513
"Princess, not seeing you, my heart-"

227
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,743
Hello...that's composed
by maestro Ilaiyaraja

228
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,434
He has composed
a similar tune

229
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,163
I know
i've heard it

230
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:43,547
"Delicate rose, so petite"

231
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:44,432
That's it

232
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,084
I just can't sleep
without listening to his songs

233
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:48,735
You know when I hear
his songs, I feel...

234
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:51,235
...I'm lying on my mother's lap
In the best comfort zone ever

235
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:53,041
I don't feel that way

236
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:53,732
Why?

237
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,654
My mother passed away
When I was very young

238
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:57,538
I'm sorry

239
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,077
But you know-

240
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:00,960
When I listen to his songs...

241
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:03,650
...I feel like I am
asleep in his own lap!

242
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:07,379
Really...I swear
That's how I feel

243
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:08,801
Why did you laugh?

244
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:10,377
Lying on S.A.Rajkumar's lap and-

245
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,750
Come on, I've spoken
to a few people I know

246
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,864
It's no big deal at all

247
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:32,402
It's not going to
be a problem

248
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:33,440
Come on
Cheer up, sis

249
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:37,706
Hi Malini

250
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,168
I am...

251
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,742
Masss

252
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,510
I just have to say this

253
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,316
You...

254
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:47,201
...are very beautiful

255
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:52,044
No one here...

256
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:54,619
...would have seen such a beautiful-

257
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,617
Beauty that's a joy forever

258
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:58,770
And I'm in love with you

259
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:01,268
Masss, you've already
said this in 2008!

260
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:02,537
Try somethng new

261
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:03,920
You think so?

262
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:06,189
Then let me go
straight to the spot

263
00:16:06,227 --> 00:16:08,302
I'll talk impromptu and
 hook her with my charm

264
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,264
Go for it, Masss

265
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:15,875
Hi...hello

266
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,911
You look kind of troubled

267
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:19,911
Nothing of that sort

268
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:21,679
You seem to be
in low spirits today

269
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,562
What happened yesterday, bro-

270
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,486
Keep quiet

271
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:25,716
What happened?

272
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:27,906
Did anyone tease you?
Did someone in the bus try-

273
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:28,982
In your area, or at home

274
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,327
Tell me, I can
set it right for you

275
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,673
Nothing of that sort happened

276
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:32,365
No problem

277
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:33,557
Then why dull?

278
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:36,439
1 minute
I'll be back

279
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:38,054
Rear side of
 Stanley hospital, bro

280
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:39,438
Come here
What's the hassle?

281
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,744
Did they stitch him up
with a watch inside during surgery?

282
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:42,857
How silly!

283
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,357
Move and stand aside

284
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:45,434
Wait for me

285
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,472
Don't ruin what
little chance I've got

286
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:48,778
Continue, my dear

287
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:51,391
Sis has been trying for
the head nurse post here

288
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,313
2 days ago when she attended
the interview, the Dean said...

289
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,081
'...there is a long queue
 eyeing this post'

290
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,965
I'm offering it to you because...

291
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,194
...you're a hard worker

292
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,540
To get this post

293
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,539
3500000

294
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,422
You get promoted
the very next day

295
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,113
I can't afford to pay
such a huge sum-

296
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,843
This is a special concession for you

297
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,034
If you pay this amount...

298
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,379
...your job will be permanent

299
00:17:10,418 --> 00:17:11,456
Okay, Malini?

300
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,993
We are breaking
our heads over it, bro

301
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:16,645
Whomever we asked
is unwilling to help us

302
00:17:16,722 --> 00:17:17,413
Julie!

303
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,414
She's so tensed-

304
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,451
Keep quiet

305
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,565
Don't take whatever
she told you seriously

306
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,294
What are friends there for?

307
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,371
3500000

308
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:27,063
I'll arrange it for you

309
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,023
Child's play to me

310
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:28,907
Give me 2 hours

311
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:30,367
I'll give the cash
 at your doorstep

312
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,097
We'll confirm the job you like

313
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:33,212
No, it's okay

314
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:34,172
Please listen to me

315
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:34,980
I'll manage

316
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,632
When in love
all this is common

317
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,206
Aren't you...

318
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,590
...in love with me?

319
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,072
We are like bees and honey

320
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,263
When we've wrapped ourselves in
this bond, how can we act like strangers?

321
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:51,147
Instead...

322
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:52,915
...unwrap this gift
packed with my love

323
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:53,991
Wow!

324
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,029
Take it

325
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,529
Our bus is here, sis

326
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:01,641
Shucks!

327
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,559
Forget it, let's drink and
bury our heads in sadness

328
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:11,673
Thanks

329
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,397
Oh God!

330
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:26,895
Jet...!

331
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,971
Let's head for the bar
Drink and be merry

332
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:33,467
Masss...Lady luck is smiling!

333
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:35,659
Jet, I'm thrilled to bits

334
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,579
My life is settled for good

335
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,347
I'll live life king size

336
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,462
- Hello, navy officer
- Let go of me

337
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,038
I'll take you to Arnold

338
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,460
Who the hell are you?

339
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,614
Reddy...?

340
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,562
I swear I didn't know
 it was your money

341
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,357
Would I have taken it
if I had known?

342
00:18:52,082 --> 00:18:54,793
Masss is such a weird name!

343
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:57,657
My name is Masilamani

344
00:18:57,735 --> 00:19:01,819
Boys in my area call me
Masss as a pet name

345
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:04,761
I maintained the same
because it sounds cool

346
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,097
One tight slap!

347
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:08,349
If you're Mr Mass
 is he Master Mass?

348
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:09,266
No...no, sir

349
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:10,947
Prince...?

350
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:11,978
Yes, bro

351
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:12,932
Kill one right here

352
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:15,301
Kill the other when you get
 the money in your hands

353
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,247
Only then this area
will be terrified of me

354
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:18,240
I'll take care of it

355
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:20,723
How did you get
conned by this fellow?

356
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:21,716
Madcap!

357
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,260
Don't

358
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,100
Let go of him

359
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:28,665
If you come near me,
I'll drop him down

360
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:29,735
Listen to me

361
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:30,422
Go back

362
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,437
Now do you realize
why they call me Masss?

363
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:34,546
Leave him

364
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:35,806
Hear me out, Masss

365
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,334
Know the risk you’re taking

366
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,357
You won't go back alive

367
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,579
Step back

368
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:41,648
I'll hit you

369
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,978
Will you try to escape?

370
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:45,467
Let go of me

371
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:46,307
Masss...don't

372
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,934
Guys, nab him

373
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:53,296
Oh gawd!
They are here

374
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:54,059
This way

375
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:54,975
God help me!

376
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:58,757
That way

377
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:00,552
Where are you going, Mass?

378
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:04,904
They are coming on their bikes

379
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:08,570
That side

380
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:19,588
Masss!

381
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:22,720
Whose bike is this?

382
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:23,789
Quick...quick

383
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,492
Go...go

384
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,689
Drop him
That side

385
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,970
Bend down
Careful...knife!

386
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:02,605
Masss, please don't turn

387
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,386
No need, Masss

388
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:12,609
Let's just escape

389
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:14,517
Watch me now

390
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,545
He hit him

391
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,045
Speed up
He's following us

392
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:37,544
Who's that shooting at us?

393
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:38,842
Go up

394
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:44,073
Masss, careful...don't risk it

395
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:46,785
God save me!

396
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,744
Watch out...door!

397
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,435
Take that bag

398
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:20,695
Check if everything is okay

399
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:21,765
Is it correct?

400
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:23,674
Okay, let's leave

401
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,226
That way

402
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:31,349
Who's shooting ow?

403
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:32,954
Hey! Don't shoot

404
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,084
They are right behind us

405
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,192
Don't miss the bag

406
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,160
He's aiming at us, Masss

407
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,230
Watch out

408
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,209
He's behind us

409
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:57,926
Jump...oh gawd!

410
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:00,715
He's shooting again

411
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:01,859
Don't shoot

412
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:03,502
Don't shoot I say

413
00:23:04,152 --> 00:23:05,451
Start the car

414
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:08,886
Thank God, we escaped

415
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:09,841
Why?

416
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,139
Watch out

417
00:23:12,248 --> 00:23:13,775
Why are you driving like a maniac?

418
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:16,103
Be quiet for sometime

419
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,433
Fasten your seat belt first

420
00:23:18,472 --> 00:23:19,425
That's okay

421
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:20,419
Wear it

422
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:23,129
Many years ago, 2 friends
of mine went to Goa

423
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,772
...to hook only white girls

424
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:26,872
They would've made them
fall hook, line and sinker

425
00:23:26,911 --> 00:23:28,477
Goa is fine, as far as places go

426
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:29,813
But will that aunty agree?

427
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:30,957
Good lord!

428
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:32,409
Are you going for
 your honeymoon?

429
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,243
Our plans got messed up
only because of her

430
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,190
Fights and chase wouldn't
have been necessary

431
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:37,716
We could've happily gone to Goa-

432
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,807
On the spot dead, dude

433
00:24:12,844 --> 00:24:13,991
Must be drunken driving, sir

434
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:15,289
Hey! Go take a look

435
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:17,198
They start the morning
 with a peg or two!

436
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:18,267
Police...police

437
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,942
Shucks, he's dead

438
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:28,235
If we stay here longer
it will become dicey, let's scoot

439
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,342
- Hey! Jet
- Masss...?

440
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:20,167
Cash!

441
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,230
What happened to the money?

442
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:24,789
Cops took it all away
 the other day itself

443
00:25:24,826 --> 00:25:26,774
Forget the money
How are you feeling now?

444
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,141
Cops took it?

445
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,624
'The other day' means...?

446
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:33,723
How many days have I
been in the hospital?

447
00:25:33,761 --> 00:25:35,519
Must be about 7 or 8 days

448
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:36,741
7 or 8 days?

449
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:40,598
Rs 6400000 I say!

450
00:25:42,354 --> 00:25:44,187
We could have settled
in life for good

451
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:46,860
Hospital bill will create
a huge hole in our wallet!

452
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:49,800
Oh my God!
What's he doing here?

453
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,327
Masss...Masss...Masss

454
00:25:51,557 --> 00:25:53,009
Bro, Prince

455
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,420
Why is Reddy here?

456
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:55,949
Did he find out we are here?

457
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,430
I've come to the hospital for chest pain

458
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:07,481
Wow!

459
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,518
Love, huh?

460
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,001
Reddy also is here

461
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:20,482
She's responsible for our accident

462
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,627
Plus we lost all that money

463
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,079
So you had better not dilly dally

464
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:27,546
When love is in the air
these villains love making an entry!

465
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:34,230
Today of all days
 unfortunately nobody is caught!

466
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,124
Where did he come from?

467
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:39,117
Sir, what's the time?

468
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:40,109
What?

469
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:40,911
Time

470
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,591
I wanted to know what the time is

471
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,731
Why are you staring at me
like you've seen a ghost?

472
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,716
His watch is just to show off
Come along, Masss

473
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:49,848
Driving an auto
and what audacity!

474
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:50,955
You watch your step, man

475
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:51,948
Okay, dude!

476
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:52,902
Excuse me, wait

477
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,155
- 2 strong tea, please
- ‘Oldie drools over heroine’s hip’

478
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:55,613
Sir, move aside

479
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:57,141
Is it glam-doll Namitha's photo?

480
00:27:05,008 --> 00:27:06,191
He is...?

481
00:27:07,566 --> 00:27:08,673
Hey Chinna

482
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,308
Look, he's washing
his face at the tea shop

483
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:12,531
Azhagu

484
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:13,713
He's wearing a blue shirt

485
00:27:13,752 --> 00:27:14,706
This guy?

486
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,373
Yeah, same guy

487
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:23,871
Let's circle him
and close his chapter

488
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:27,231
I think Reddy's men
are here to kill us

489
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:27,958
Where?

490
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:29,141
I had asked for 2 tea, right?

491
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,631
I'll count 1-2-3

492
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:31,624
And we'll escape

493
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:32,655
One

494
00:27:33,838 --> 00:27:34,373
Two

495
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:35,252
Three!

496
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:37,390
Masss, quick
Get into the bus

497
00:27:37,428 --> 00:27:38,993
Good for nothing idiot!

498
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,330
I should be
the one to say '3'!

499
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,964
- Get in
- Grab him

500
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,446
Hey! Trying to bump me off?

501
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:46,822
Try your luck
Hurry up

502
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:53,062
First shut the door

503
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:58,486
How do we stay in
 this house hereafter?

504
00:27:58,524 --> 00:28:01,730
- We must escape at the crack of dawn
- Keep saying 1,2,s,x,y and z!

505
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,105
Reddy's men will surely kill us!

506
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:06,924
Hey! Jet

507
00:28:07,496 --> 00:28:08,871
Didn't you see someone walk past?

508
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:10,704
Your fertile imagination
I'm feeling sleepy!

509
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:33,119
Hey! Jet

510
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:35,831
Will you please shut that window?

511
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,595
(snoring)

512
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:37,626
Hey...!

513
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,152
Pccht!

514
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:55,039
Jet...Jet

515
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,024
What happened?

516
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:58,017
Reddy's boys are here

517
00:28:58,056 --> 00:29:00,003
Aiyo! What do we do now?

518
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,569
We don't even have the money with us!

519
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,593
Shall we escape
through the back door?

520
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:05,387
Why should we run?

521
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:11,459
Who are you?

522
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:13,598
What do you want now?

523
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,393
Did Reddy send you here?

524
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:17,340
Did he ask you to
grab the cash and kill us?

525
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:18,562
We don't have any money

526
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:20,395
The police took it all away

527
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:21,884
Commissioner's house is nearby

528
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:23,374
Shall I call now? Tell me

529
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,672
We are done for!

530
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:41,511
Hey! I'm telling you

531
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:43,192
And you keep moving in closer?

532
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:45,827
No more words
Only action!

533
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,411
Hey Massssss!

534
00:29:55,946 --> 00:29:59,077
There's someone so scary insi-

535
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,095
Something even more scary behind you

536
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,393
Run for your life

537
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,813
Ghost...ghost...help!

538
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,961
How come we are seeing ghosts?

539
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,756
They've been chasing us from the hospital

540
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,200
My leg is hurting

541
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,942
Right behind you

542
00:31:15,018 --> 00:31:16,203
Run...run

543
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:22,427
Don't come near me

544
00:31:39,402 --> 00:31:41,578
Hey! How do we escape
 from these creatures?

545
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:42,839
There's only one way

546
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:43,716
Let's go to a temple

547
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:44,517
And exorcise them

548
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:46,160
Don't be funny

549
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:47,726
I'm not joking
I'm serious

550
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:49,407
From yesteryear films

551
00:31:49,444 --> 00:31:50,972
...to films by Sundar.C today

552
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,499
...only God can destroy ghosts!

553
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,141
- You think so?
- Yeah

554
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,199
Run...let's run to safety

555
00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:13,792
Masss...Masss...Masss

556
00:32:14,287 --> 00:32:16,807
Didn't I tell you
spirits won't enter a temple?

557
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:18,602
Correct, but how do we get out?

558
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:20,895
The dead is chasing

559
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:22,383
The living is running

560
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,101
You died and survived, right?

561
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,667
There's more to come

562
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:26,928
Much more in store for you

563
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:29,486
Swami, are you talking about us?

564
00:32:30,326 --> 00:32:31,625
I'm so puzzled

565
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:34,145
From last night
wherever we go, ghosts-

566
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:36,055
It's all fate's antics

567
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:37,505
Your destiny!

568
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:39,453
Isn't this a kind of rebirth for you?

569
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:43,233
That's why you're able to
see all these ghosts and ghouls

570
00:32:43,348 --> 00:32:45,371
All this is a boon, my boy

571
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,510
- For whom?
- Blessing in disguise

572
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:49,726
No, I don't want this blessing

573
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:52,322
Being able to see ghosts
you call it a blessing?

574
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,314
Release them

575
00:32:53,352 --> 00:32:54,919
I don't have that power

576
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:58,279
Whoever sent them
has to remove them

577
00:32:58,317 --> 00:32:59,310
They are not spirits

578
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:00,607
They are lost souls

579
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,250
They won't harm you one bit

580
00:33:02,326 --> 00:33:04,580
Just satisfy their wish-list

581
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:06,374
Then they'll go their own way

582
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:08,092
Their wish-list?

583
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:10,423
If I turn my back
they''ll close my chapter

584
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,988
I'm not game for this

585
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,181
You've zoomed through huge catastrophes

586
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,899
Are you scared of these zombies?

587
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,420
If you think a stone is a stone...

588
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,909
...you'll only see a stone!

589
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:25,048
If you keep the same stone
 in a temple...

590
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,193
...it's God!

591
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:30,013
Mind is responsible for eveything

592
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,226
If you look at them with fear...

593
00:33:32,264 --> 00:33:33,677
...they'll be ghosts to you

594
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:35,434
Look at them ordinarily

595
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:36,962
They'll look like human beings!

596
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,475
Focus your mind

597
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,728
Everything will be fine

598
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:44,446
Don't be afraid

599
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,280
Gawd! He's looking at me

600
00:33:46,356 --> 00:33:47,501
Is he your friend?

601
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:48,265
Yes

602
00:33:48,303 --> 00:33:49,716
He's a good boy
Take care

603
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:51,970
You still have a lot
to care and share

604
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,841
You'll be fine

605
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,558
Not to worry, you'll do fine

606
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:57,353
Mass, what's he saying?

607
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,607
Don't take him seriously

608
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,554
He just blabbered some nonsense

609
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,984
'Focus your mind'

610
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:10,909
Only human beings all over the place

611
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:13,162
Whom will I ask and what to ask?

612
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:14,576
Sir...?

613
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:15,760
Excuse me, flower seller

614
00:34:15,798 --> 00:34:17,897
Did you see anyone in a red t-shirt?

615
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,074
No one seems to notice us!

616
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:22,557
Found 1 fellow
And he also escaped!

617
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,466
They said he went this side

618
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:26,183
But he's nowhere to be seen!

619
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,292
- Jet
- What?

620
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,506
It's all in the mind, right?

621
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:34,394
Sir, my phone and wallet are missing

622
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:35,158
Don't get tensed

623
00:34:35,196 --> 00:34:37,564
This phone costs Rs 35000
Gifted by my future-bride, sir

624
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:38,976
You might have left it in your car

625
00:34:39,015 --> 00:34:39,855
Let's go and check

626
00:34:39,894 --> 00:34:41,038
You're not responding at all

627
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:41,993
Please find it for me

628
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:44,704
They all look only like human beings!

629
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:47,531
I'm also confused, Jet

630
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,744
You sinner...whose phone is this?

631
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,922
The one who went
past us whining now

632
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:54,136
His wallet also?

633
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:55,777
Does this hotel
belong to your dad?

634
00:34:55,817 --> 00:34:56,924
Who will pay the bill?

635
00:34:57,993 --> 00:35:00,933
How to differentiate
humans from ghosts?

636
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:02,996
I saw an English film, Jet

637
00:35:03,378 --> 00:35:05,364
I believe ghosts can't be
captured in a camera?

638
00:35:06,318 --> 00:35:07,426
Shall we test it?

639
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:08,457
Let's try

640
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:11,015
Masss, behind you

641
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:12,198
Green shirt

642
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:14,223
He looks spooky
Just like a ghost

643
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:15,292
Click a snap of him

644
00:35:22,127 --> 00:35:23,769
Hey! Correct

645
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:25,183
One in a green shirt is a man

646
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:26,405
The white one is a spirit!

647
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:27,664
Couldn't get him in the camera

648
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:29,574
Spirit looks more decent than the man!

649
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,598
No one will believe us if we say it, right?

650
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:33,698
They will brand us as lunatics

651
00:35:33,736 --> 00:35:35,262
Hey! Stay like that

652
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,333
Yeah, okay

653
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:37,822
A lady over there
is looking at us

654
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,235
Don't move

655
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:39,885
Ready?

656
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,183
Just a minute

657
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,748
Smiiiile...!

658
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:45,459
Got a good shot?

659
00:36:46,824 --> 00:36:47,779
Masss

660
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:53,661
Masss, am I dead?

661
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:58,740
Please tell me, Masss

662
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:30,930
Why did you leave me?

663
00:37:57,038 --> 00:37:59,319
I am having a tough time here

664
00:37:59,471 --> 00:38:01,864
You're ignoring me
and drinking coolly

665
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:04,336
Hey! I'm so puzzled, dude

666
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:06,807
I feel so blank

667
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,251
Get me a half boiled egg

668
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:10,113
You really live life to the fullest

669
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:11,633
You needn't drink or smoke

670
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:12,887
You don't even have to bathe

671
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,029
What a cushy life!

672
00:38:15,131 --> 00:38:17,372
You're hassle-free and happy

673
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,235
Why is he talking to himself?

674
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:21,249
Is this how you talk
to your dead friend?

675
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:23,340
Are you made of stone or what?

676
00:38:23,378 --> 00:38:25,164
You don't look dead to me at all

677
00:38:25,468 --> 00:38:27,483
Suppose you are not next to me...

678
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,966
...then I might miss you

679
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:31,208
You are sitting right in front of me

680
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:32,348
Why should I feel bad?

681
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:33,451
Still...

682
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,009
...I'm unable to drink

683
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,750
Masss, you know the rites
they do for dead people?

684
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:43,373
Similarly you can offer
starters and liquor to me

685
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:50,405
Eat

686
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:51,773
Go ahead

687
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:53,788
Help yourself

688
00:38:57,361 --> 00:38:58,044
In your dreams!

689
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:00,212
You can't even drink
what's right before your eyes

690
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:02,074
And your taste buds
ask for offerings!

691
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:04,278
But on top of it
highlight is...

692
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:07,584
...you being a ghost,
sprinted from all other spirits!

693
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:10,778
They were all spooky and scary

694
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,629
None of them are fair
and handsome like me, right?

695
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:20,492
Hey! Come here

696
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,810
Get me the same liquor
that chap is drinking!

697
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:24,331
Quick...go

698
00:39:25,776 --> 00:39:27,675
(shooing)

699
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:29,919
Dogs at night
are a real pain

700
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,971
Masss, look over there

701
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:34,594
2 spirits on top of
the boot of that car

702
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,797
That dog is chasing the spirits away

703
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,508
Are we visible to dogs?

704
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,372
Is that why dogs
start chasing at night?

705
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:42,689
All these days we thought
they were chasing us?!

706
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:45,123
They were actually
targetting ghosts only

707
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:47,479
Imagine if people get to
know this information!

708
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,025
The whole city at night
will be still as a tombstone

709
00:39:50,102 --> 00:39:51,811
Those who watch
night shows are doomed

710
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:52,914
Will be scared to death

711
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:55,614
Life is strange

712
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:57,588
Isn't that Malini?

713
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,984
What's up?
At this time of night?

714
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,200
Fancy seeing you here?

715
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,594
We were waiting for you
in front of your house

716
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:05,799
Thinking you'll be late
we decided to leave

717
00:40:06,597 --> 00:40:07,965
Very pretty

718
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,056
Sorry, I'm slightly drun-

719
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:11,083
That's alright

720
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,667
Your friend's death must be a huge loss

721
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:14,541
I understand

722
00:40:16,593 --> 00:40:17,620
What happened?

723
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:18,837
Why?

724
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,737
I had just one soul friend

725
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:21,459
Masss

726
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:23,131
He has also left me now

727
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:23,893
Please don't cry

728
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,070
Why are you crying now?

729
00:40:25,108 --> 00:40:26,667
My heart feels so heavy with grief

730
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:28,186
I'm right here with you

731
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:29,441
Aiyaiyo!

732
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:30,733
He has hugged her

733
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:34,763
A little while ago you told me
you have no feelings whatsoever

734
00:40:35,864 --> 00:40:36,701
Don't cry

735
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:37,955
We are all there for you

736
00:40:38,906 --> 00:40:40,046
I'll be there for you

737
00:40:40,996 --> 00:40:42,098
Sorry

738
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,189
What did you just say?

739
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,317
I said I'm here for you

740
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:48,027
Scout's honor?

741
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:50,271
Maybe...

742
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,437
...for the 2 of us to unite

743
00:40:52,892 --> 00:40:54,946
...Jet went up

744
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,694
Why are you looking up?

745
00:40:56,808 --> 00:40:57,949
I'm here

746
00:40:58,062 --> 00:40:59,164
If Jet was in front of us...

747
00:40:59,203 --> 00:41:00,761
...how happy he'd have been you know

748
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,166
- Look at me
- Jet, go

749
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:03,042
Do I look happy?

750
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,992
Jet, just go

751
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:05,550
See you

752
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:08,974
I'll see you in the hospital tomorrow

753
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:11,977
No, bro, she isn't coming
nowadays to the hospital

754
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:12,927
Why?

755
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:13,878
What happened?

756
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:15,664
We told you already, right?

757
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:17,716
Dean wanted a bribe
for her placement

758
00:41:18,553 --> 00:41:20,340
You promised to give-

759
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,493
But you were in
that awful accident-

760
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,786
She came here for the money

761
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:25,851
Don't think it's love

762
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:27,941
Mosquito!

763
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:29,157
How much did you want?

764
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,221
350000

765
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:32,958
3.5 lakhs

766
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:34,632
It's doable

767
00:41:35,164 --> 00:41:37,140
Give me just 2 days

768
00:41:37,937 --> 00:41:38,887
No, it's okay

769
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,446
Don't strain yourself too much

770
00:41:40,522 --> 00:41:41,397
I can do it

771
00:41:41,472 --> 00:41:42,308
Oh! Yes, we can!

772
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:43,145
It's a piece of cake

773
00:41:43,183 --> 00:41:44,286
Take care

774
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:45,159
See you

775
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:46,680
Money was her hidden agenda!

776
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:48,656
Money makes the world go round!!

777
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:51,394
Get lost

778
00:41:53,141 --> 00:41:54,586
What's your plan of action?

779
00:41:55,194 --> 00:41:56,372
350000

780
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,653
2 days...how?

781
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:00,667
Ask for a loan?

782
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:01,959
Or sell your bike?

783
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:04,772
That bike will hardly fetch
a packet of dates for your date!

784
00:42:05,076 --> 00:42:07,015
What shall we do?

785
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:11,804
3.5 lakhs in 2 days
I think it's impossible

786
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,552
What's up?

787
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,807
Why that smiley emoticon?

788
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,326
Got an idea, huh?

789
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:29,821
Azhagu...?

790
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:32,366
Oh...ohmmmm!

791
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:34,154
What are you doing there?

792
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:35,408
Meditation, you moron!

793
00:42:35,864 --> 00:42:39,854
"If you meditate chanting 'Om'
all comforts will land up at your home"

794
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:42,629
Let's attend a community prayer

795
00:42:43,276 --> 00:42:45,291
(smacking lips)

796
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,141
Yov! What are you doing?

797
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:50,232
Ages since I ate such a feast

798
00:42:50,308 --> 00:42:51,752
Don't try to be funny
Come with me

799
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:57,681
What?

800
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:00,152
Why did you call all of us?

801
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:01,445
Who else is there?

802
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:02,432
That's all, Masss

803
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,219
This is it, huh?

804
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:05,436
For now, yes

805
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:08,325
Hey...hey, get up

806
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:10,224
Stand with hands folded in respect

807
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:12,048
- He's going overboard
- Fold your hands

808
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:13,342
Why all this build-up?

809
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:14,938
Build-up begets bowed heads!

810
00:43:15,584 --> 00:43:18,967
Look here! I know why
you are all following me

811
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:21,019
You have a list of
unfulfilled desires

812
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:23,453
You think you can tick
 your wish list through me

813
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,125
Am I right?

814
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:27,899
Each of your wishes can be satisfied

815
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:31,433
But what do I get in return?

816
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:32,462
You'll be blessed

817
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:34,056
Who wants your blessing?

818
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:36,412
Old man!
Do you need this?

819
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,974
Old man, what do I do
with your blessing?

820
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:44,129
You don't need food, clothing
shelter, no creature comforts

821
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,307
But I do, right?

822
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,094
I get hungry

823
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,424
I need to look tip top

824
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:49,754
Pay my rent

825
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:51,920
Cope with the villains
in each area my work takes me

826
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:52,947
Plus a new love story

827
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:54,962
You know what a costly affair
being in love is!

828
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:56,215
Yes, of course

829
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:00,477
So first you help me

830
00:44:00,857 --> 00:44:03,251
I will return the favor
according to your wish list

831
00:44:03,328 --> 00:44:05,075
Fair deal
Tailor made for us

832
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:05,988
Sales rep!

833
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:08,230
Whose side are you on?

834
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,043
If we asked them for help...

835
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,095
...they are asking help in return

836
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:14,996
I strongly protest this-

837
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:18,418
Gone

838
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:21,077
You're joining with him
 and taking a dig at us!

839
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,625
Chinna, he has promised
 to help us, right?

840
00:44:23,814 --> 00:44:26,362
Sunna! How is he helping us?

841
00:44:26,437 --> 00:44:29,402
Yes, according to Human rights law 407

842
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,504
(wailing)

843
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,861
Madam, I'm talking on your behalf too

844
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:33,888
And you keep weeping

845
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:34,647
Keep quiet

846
00:44:34,685 --> 00:44:35,977
That's exactly what I said too

847
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:37,497
You said, head, dead

848
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:39,854
Instead of selling, have you
started playing second fiddle?

849
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:41,565
Why are you both squabbling like this?

850
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:44,188
(overlap of loud voices)

851
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:50,725
Shut up!

852
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:53,576
I kept quiet
giving you a long rope

853
00:44:53,728 --> 00:44:55,401
You are letting your tongue run!

854
00:44:56,882 --> 00:44:58,631
You can't do any damn thing

855
00:44:58,669 --> 00:44:59,771
Yeah, he's right

856
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:01,482
If you listen to me and help me...

857
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:02,699
...I'll help you in return

858
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:03,649
Or else...

859
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,435
...clear out

860
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:07,944
Jet, ask them to leave

861
00:45:08,095 --> 00:45:10,186
Those who believe
Masss will help you...

862
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:11,212
...come over to this side

863
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,390
Hey Sales!
Inviting himself

864
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:13,531
Shameless fellow

865
00:45:13,872 --> 00:45:15,431
- Sir, your name?
- Sripathy

866
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:17,027
Come this side
like Sripathy

867
00:45:17,065 --> 00:45:17,864
Come on, guys

868
00:45:17,902 --> 00:45:19,993
They've gone out of
their way to request you

869
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:20,942
Come over

870
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,778
Uncle, just come

871
00:45:21,968 --> 00:45:24,250
Don't go over there

872
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:25,770
Loser!

873
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:28,620
Don't we all need to be helped?

874
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:30,673
That's what we were
waiting for all along

875
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:33,030
Why are you hesitating?

876
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:37,020
Goddess Shakthi has sent
this boy specially for us

877
00:45:37,211 --> 00:45:38,655
Come over

878
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:39,833
Listen, old man

879
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,315
We'll agree because of you

880
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:43,711
But mind you, they shouldn't
go back on their words

881
00:45:43,787 --> 00:45:44,736
Hello!

882
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:47,816
Such words don't exist
in my dictionary

883
00:45:47,891 --> 00:45:49,526
Sonny, what should we do?

884
00:45:51,274 --> 00:45:54,201
If we just cut this scene-

885
00:46:05,413 --> 00:46:06,630
(humming)

886
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:09,008
Can I eat now?

887
00:46:09,122 --> 00:46:10,187
Give me few minutes

888
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,669
Won't I be hungry?

889
00:46:11,973 --> 00:46:13,988
How long will I wait here?

890
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:15,583
I came out of the shower hours ago!

891
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:20,944
What happened, dear?

892
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:23,528
Hunger pangs increased!

893
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:33,487
Don't show now

894
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,793
You're in for a lecture

895
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:39,834
Soooper  report card

896
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,784
3 zeroes

897
00:46:40,822 --> 00:46:41,620
Very good

898
00:46:41,658 --> 00:46:42,685
I love you, my dear son

899
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:44,623
Remove your glasses

900
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:47,131
2 zeroes are here

901
00:46:47,169 --> 00:46:48,766
Where did they find the 3rd zero?

902
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,096
Useless fellow!

903
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:53,403
I don't know why you go-

904
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:00,549
Why is your plate jumping like that?

905
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:04,463
Run...run

906
00:47:05,718 --> 00:47:07,391
Wait, don't leave me

907
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:09,405
Get inside

908
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:11,229
Let me also come in with you

909
00:47:22,558 --> 00:47:24,382
Hello...who is it?

910
00:47:27,728 --> 00:47:29,894
Someone has opened the hot water tap

911
00:47:35,405 --> 00:47:38,028
9-6-000

912
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:40,498
690-9

913
00:47:40,612 --> 00:47:42,590
I don't know whose number this is!

914
00:47:42,628 --> 00:47:43,844
You better call right now

915
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:53,726
Can I meet the owner of this house?

916
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:07,448
I'm the owner, sir

917
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:09,500
Why are you looking so pathetic?

918
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:11,247
Sir

919
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:14,479
The TV moves in my house, sir

920
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:16,722
Books fly off the shelf

921
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,394
Plates act like frisbees

922
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:19,838
Am I not here for you?

923
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:21,016
Don't worry

924
00:48:21,054 --> 00:48:22,309
Thank you, sir

925
00:48:22,424 --> 00:48:24,058
Come inside

926
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,999
Did the TV move?

927
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,025
Yes, sir

928
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:31,774
Boss, my handiwork

929
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:33,066
Just 1 push

930
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:37,326
- Did plates jump?
- Yes, sir

931
00:48:37,364 --> 00:48:39,151
Sat at the table and
it started dancing, sir

932
00:48:39,228 --> 00:48:40,330
I take full responsibility

933
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:41,887
Actually you know how I got this idea-

934
00:48:41,924 --> 00:48:43,066
Just shut up and keep quiet

935
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,335
I was the one
who threw toys at him

936
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,274
Only then he pressed the panic button

937
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:52,681
Due to my age I couldn't
throw ay stuff at him

938
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:54,811
Already my heart is beating fas-

939
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,913
You are already dead

940
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:57,509
What's your problem?

941
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:02,488
Shouldn't you respect him for his age?

942
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:03,933
How can you yell at him?

943
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,681
We've done our part

944
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,773
It's your turn now

945
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,103
(gibberish mantra)

946
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:15,412
There are many spirits in your house

947
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:16,856
Many spirits...?

948
00:49:16,894 --> 00:49:18,036
Soooper

949
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:18,909
He means all of us

950
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:23,356
Because you have made
some blunders in your life

951
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:29,703
True, sir

952
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:31,679
Is there any retribution, sir?

953
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:38,408
Rs 500000

954
00:49:38,446 --> 00:49:39,586
5 lakhs?

955
00:49:39,624 --> 00:49:40,688
It is too much, sir

956
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,057
This won't work

957
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,945
Will you keep quiet, dear?

958
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,112
I'll pay you whatever you ask

959
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,405
Oh! The main switch is here

960
00:49:48,442 --> 00:49:49,963
Just tell us what we should do

961
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,509
What you need to do is-

962
00:49:57,755 --> 00:50:00,262
In your prayer room,
draw a star with rice flour

963
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:01,822
Box it with drumsticks

964
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,571
Place a rolling pin in the centre

965
00:50:03,608 --> 00:50:05,280
With the power of my prayers...

966
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:07,409
...if the rolling pin
crosses over the drumstick

967
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:09,309
...means your house
is free of spirits

968
00:50:11,019 --> 00:50:12,655
Azhagu, super channel

969
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:14,402
Doesn't she dance
with wings to her feet?

970
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,417
Masss, who is she?

971
00:50:16,454 --> 00:50:18,128
Katrina Kaif

972
00:50:18,508 --> 00:50:19,686
Masss, how much longer?

973
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:20,940
Shall I roll it out?

974
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:22,004
Okay...okay

975
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,917
Hold on to it

976
00:50:23,828 --> 00:50:25,121
Enough, he asked you to wind up

977
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,375
Shall I bring it out?

978
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:37,132
Roll...roll...roll over

979
00:50:42,872 --> 00:50:43,633
Wait

980
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,886
Let me do the honors

981
00:50:45,797 --> 00:50:48,459
You'll be ghosts-free hereafter

982
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:54,046
Sign your son's report card

983
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:55,681
Okay, my boy?

984
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,625
'You know, there is
a spooky world out there'

985
00:51:33,994 --> 00:51:37,605
'This is very very scary'

986
00:51:56,876 --> 00:51:59,156
"Boo-boo-boogeyman the monster"

987
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,022
"A good catch made him the winner"

988
00:52:06,075 --> 00:52:08,204
"Boo-boo-boogeyman a specter"

989
00:52:08,279 --> 00:52:10,445
"The right catch made him the winner"

990
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,574
"He has the gift of the gab, you bet"

991
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:15,083
"He worked 24x7 to be the best"

992
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,975
"He’ll be right next to you; still
cross the 8 seas he will"

993
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:22,875
"To bring items fanciful"

994
00:52:22,912 --> 00:52:24,053
"He’s a wily whiz-kid"

995
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:27,322
"He’ll simply say ‘take your pick’
Plant gifts on your palm double quick"

996
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,427
"Not just once but quite often
he paints the town a deep maroon!"

997
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:36,520
"By pulling a fast one, rascal clever
spins a tale and closes your chapter"

998
00:52:36,672 --> 00:52:40,739
"If you are oblivious
of the obvious"

999
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:42,981
"He’ll count
Tally the account"

1000
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,023
"Blindfold and spirit away
 a king’s ransom everyday"

1001
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:52,006
"I planned a game that was a hit
Fitted in my story as a huge benefit"

1002
00:53:52,121 --> 00:53:56,150
"It offers on a golden platter
Aids and abets an overflowing coffer

1003
00:53:56,644 --> 00:54:01,243
"Let our love story never waver
Let your memories not issue a waiver"

1004
00:54:01,357 --> 00:54:05,690
"Hidden in the layers of my mind cosily
I favour and savor, forget-not easily"

1005
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,517
"Don’t treat this as credit but debit
Love lavishly to make a profit"

1006
00:54:10,632 --> 00:54:14,812
"This age old love is brand new
A prize which blooms 366 days true"

1007
00:54:14,983 --> 00:54:19,507
"Boo-boo-boogeyman the monster"

1008
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:23,421
"Boo-boo-boogeyman the conjurer"

1009
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,901
Give me 2 big rooms

1010
00:55:43,819 --> 00:55:48,075
"Whether Heaven or green earth
I’m walking an un-trodden path"

1011
00:55:48,493 --> 00:55:53,167
"Your birth and mine
 now aligned on a single line"

1012
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:55,601
"It’s a whole new world waved by a wand"

1013
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:59,973
"Time no longer in demand
Magic has the upper hand"

1014
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:08,828
"Boo-boo-boogeyman the conjurer
With knack he hooked a good looker"

1015
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:13,502
Didn't Masss bro tell us
he works in a finance company?

1016
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,872
All lies

1017
00:56:14,948 --> 00:56:16,277
You know what he is up to?

1018
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,069
You called me and now you're silent

1019
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:23,684
Do you believe in ghosts?

1020
00:56:23,991 --> 00:56:25,914
You might as well have been quiet!

1021
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:28,566
Why do you flick a good
love scene and choose horror?

1022
00:56:28,835 --> 00:56:30,374
Answer my question

1023
00:56:30,412 --> 00:56:31,641
Do ghosts exist or not?

1024
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,294
Will anyone say it exists if it doesn't?

1025
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:34,601
Have you seen a ghost?

1026
00:56:35,254 --> 00:56:37,946
Ghosts...I haven't seen any

1027
00:56:37,985 --> 00:56:40,175
How do you exorcise them
 if you haven't seen any?

1028
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,084
You left this behind at
Julie's uncle's house last week

1029
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,775
What's your link
with these spirits?

1030
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,450
You won't believe me

1031
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,333
I've been seeing ghosts
 for sometime now

1032
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,715
Didn't I say you won't believe me?

1033
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:04,831
Just leave it

1034
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:06,945
They are rich enough
to part with their money

1035
00:57:06,983 --> 00:57:09,212
Don't justify what you earn
through unfair ways

1036
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:12,327
The doctor who demanded a bribe
for your job is justified!

1037
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:14,018
You paying up is excused

1038
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:16,286
Only problem is how
I earned that money!

1039
00:57:16,364 --> 00:57:17,593
Is that right?

1040
00:57:18,324 --> 00:57:18,824
Hello...?

1041
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:20,131
Sir, I'm calling from Besant Nagar

1042
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:22,013
Something strange is happening in our house

1043
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,590
I'm outside now
I'll talk to you later

1044
00:57:23,629 --> 00:57:24,435
Sir, please, hello-

1045
00:57:24,628 --> 00:57:27,088
If I should get a job
by exploiting people...

1046
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:28,357
...then I don't want that job

1047
00:57:28,395 --> 00:57:29,894
If you want
I'll return that money

1048
00:57:29,933 --> 00:57:31,547
I should repay Julie's uncle

1049
00:57:31,587 --> 00:57:32,776
If I do that, problem solved?

1050
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:34,315
Why get tensed for this?

1051
00:57:34,353 --> 00:57:36,160
It isn't hunky dory
just because you pay back

1052
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:37,505
Please give up
being a con man

1053
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:41,350
You've had a raw deal in life
from when you were a kid

1054
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:42,310
I do understand

1055
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,157
But now I'm with you, right?

1056
00:57:44,233 --> 00:57:45,886
Let's start life afresh

1057
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:47,117
Listen to me

1058
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,114
Sir, I had called you earlier

1059
00:57:51,153 --> 00:57:51,729
I'm outsid-

1060
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:52,921
I'm willing to pay any amount

1061
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:54,228
- Where are you?
- Besant Nagar

1062
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:56,188
- Address?
- 17, Ashtalakshmi Nagar

1063
00:57:56,227 --> 00:57:57,188
Okay, I'll come

1064
00:57:57,226 --> 00:57:58,456
Trust me, I'll come

1065
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,610
Here's the ring you gave me

1066
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:01,532
Sir, please come

1067
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:04,030
Bye

1068
00:58:05,376 --> 00:58:06,991
Please rush here at once

1069
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:08,759
Will be there in 10 minutes

1070
00:58:08,797 --> 00:58:09,758
Okay, sir

1071
00:58:14,448 --> 00:58:15,793
Hello...you are-

1072
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:17,140
Are you the one who called me?

1073
00:58:17,716 --> 00:58:19,407
Okay, let's go inside

1074
00:58:19,445 --> 00:58:20,675
We don't want to come in

1075
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:21,751
Give me that money

1076
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:23,790
Rs 300000

1077
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:25,827
Even if you want more
we are prepared to pay

1078
00:58:25,864 --> 00:58:26,825
We'll stay outside

1079
00:58:27,479 --> 00:58:28,517
Let's go

1080
00:58:31,747 --> 00:58:34,360
Why have you turned
this place upside down?

1081
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:42,587
Hey...Jet

1082
00:58:44,009 --> 00:58:45,892
Didn't I tell you all to take off?

1083
00:58:46,278 --> 00:58:47,777
Why this torture?

1084
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:53,889
Hey! Can't you hear me?

1085
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:55,542
I'm talking to you

1086
00:59:02,077 --> 00:59:03,692
Hey! Who is that?

1087
00:59:03,769 --> 00:59:04,767
Come out

1088
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,304
Don't simply try to scare me

1089
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,996
Whoever it is should own up

1090
00:59:10,726 --> 00:59:11,611
Do you get it?

1091
00:59:11,688 --> 00:59:13,378
Who did this?

1092
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:17,530
Jet...!

1093
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:24,450
Okay, fine...Sripathy?

1094
00:59:41,864 --> 00:59:44,401
Guys, where are you?

1095
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,610
Why this cat and mouse game?

1096
01:01:20,774 --> 01:01:21,965
Who are you?

1097
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:24,156
Masss, I was looking for you everywhere

1098
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:26,347
Who is this?

1099
01:01:26,424 --> 01:01:27,808
Looks like your clone

1100
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:29,038
Who are you, man?

1101
01:01:29,116 --> 01:01:29,730
I am-

1102
01:01:29,768 --> 01:01:30,346
I know

1103
01:01:31,152 --> 01:01:34,035
You are both twin brothers

1104
01:01:34,496 --> 01:01:35,727
In the estate in Ooty...

1105
01:01:35,765 --> 01:01:39,263
...your manager and 2 of his friends
pushed you down the hill and killed you

1106
01:01:39,301 --> 01:01:41,417
Actor Major Sundarajan
played a  major part

1107
01:01:41,455 --> 01:01:42,493
Will you shut up?

1108
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:43,837
Who are you?

1109
01:01:43,915 --> 01:01:46,913
You're wrong if you think
I'm your sibling

1110
01:01:47,527 --> 01:01:48,720
My name is Sakthi

1111
01:01:49,297 --> 01:01:51,795
I need a favor from you

1112
01:01:51,912 --> 01:01:53,602
Oh! You are a Tamilian from Ceylon, huh?

1113
01:01:53,641 --> 01:01:54,409
Thank God

1114
01:01:54,448 --> 01:01:56,293
If you had introduced yourself
as my sibling...

1115
01:01:56,331 --> 01:01:58,408
...our story would have
taken a different turn

1116
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:00,330
To ask for my help
you gave such a build up!

1117
01:02:00,368 --> 01:02:01,369
What build up, Masss?

1118
01:02:01,406 --> 01:02:02,443
Lights are turning off

1119
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:04,058
Foot ball rolls around the floor

1120
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:06,173
He even entered from that mirror

1121
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:06,941
Oh! Really?

1122
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,748
- Even I got a little jittery
- Seriously...?

1123
01:02:08,787 --> 01:02:10,132
Why did you play such a drama?

1124
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,285
There's a mile long queue
of people asking for help

1125
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,784
You first stand in line

1126
01:02:14,322 --> 01:02:16,129
Hey, if he needs help...

1127
01:02:16,206 --> 01:02:17,935
...first teach him
the rules and regulations

1128
01:02:18,012 --> 01:02:18,550
Okay

1129
01:02:18,589 --> 01:02:19,666
Smart Alec!

1130
01:02:19,857 --> 01:02:21,356
Wait, where are you going now?

1131
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:23,548
Why act like a celebrity
when you need help?

1132
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,469
Whatever the scene
only Masss can act big

1133
01:02:25,546 --> 01:02:26,776
No one else should

1134
01:02:27,546 --> 01:02:29,237
Meet me tomorrow morning

1135
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:30,737
I’ll take care of everything

1136
01:02:30,775 --> 01:02:32,313
If you’re bored to come by yourself...

1137
01:02:32,351 --> 01:02:34,350
...bring a beautiful
glam-doll ghost with you

1138
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:37,002
Marriott top floor, suite room

1139
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:38,117
Upstairs...upstairs

1140
01:02:38,195 --> 01:02:38,925
Bye...bye

1141
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,423
See you tomorrow

1142
01:02:41,962 --> 01:02:44,691
Who went to Julie’s uncle’s house
and gave them the flyer?

1143
01:02:44,922 --> 01:02:45,498
I don't know

1144
01:02:45,537 --> 01:02:47,497
Julie promptly went and
complained to Malini

1145
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:48,689
I was so hassled

1146
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,726
Easier to have a live-in
relationship with ghosts

1147
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:52,302
But girls, I swear!

1148
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:08,602
Death's client!

1149
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,755
You could have killed me

1150
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:10,986
What's wrong with you?

1151
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,714
Are you really mad?

1152
01:03:13,905 --> 01:03:15,714
Or acting like one?

1153
01:03:15,944 --> 01:03:16,789
How dare you!

1154
01:03:16,866 --> 01:03:17,828
If I get angry-

1155
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:18,750
If you do?

1156
01:03:18,788 --> 01:03:21,402
What do you take me for?

1157
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:22,710
Masss

1158
01:03:22,787 --> 01:03:24,363
You can’t do any damn-

1159
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,437
God has blessed you
with such a super gift

1160
01:03:27,476 --> 01:03:28,898
To see supernatural spirits like us

1161
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,666
Is this how you abuse it?

1162
01:03:30,744 --> 01:03:31,858
Instead you can...

1163
01:03:32,128 --> 01:03:33,319
...beg for a living!

1164
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:34,356
Me...a beggar?

1165
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:36,701
If you had been alive...

1166
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,124
...I'd have hacked you to pieces

1167
01:03:38,201 --> 01:03:39,969
Didn't I tell you to stand in line?

1168
01:03:40,086 --> 01:03:41,123
Following me like this

1169
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:42,198
Why this do or die rush?

1170
01:03:42,237 --> 01:03:46,812
You are a pro in stealing,
pick pocketing and swindling

1171
01:03:46,851 --> 01:03:49,618
Why do you then resort to
sending spirits to different houses...

1172
01:03:49,694 --> 01:03:51,655
...terrorize folks
grab their money?

1173
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:55,192
Instead use the same spirits...

1174
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:59,036
...to find out the locker numbers

1175
01:03:59,113 --> 01:04:01,919
And right there make a killing!

1176
01:04:02,111 --> 01:04:03,957
That...how is that possible?

1177
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:05,763
Use spirits to check out lockers

1178
01:04:05,802 --> 01:04:07,724
Why didn’t you guys
get such brainwaves?

1179
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,070
That’s not the point…

1180
01:04:09,108 --> 01:04:10,491
Your I.Q level when alive...

1181
01:04:10,569 --> 01:04:12,414
...will be the same after you die too!

1182
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:15,528
Only in films ghosts will be brainy

1183
01:04:15,835 --> 01:04:16,989
What rubbish!

1184
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:20,794
How much is the locker worth
in the house we went to now?

1185
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,870
I have no idea about that locker

1186
01:04:23,524 --> 01:04:25,445
But the locker I’m talking about...

1187
01:04:25,484 --> 01:04:26,945
...has 750 million

1188
01:04:27,176 --> 01:04:29,135
Oh my gawd!

1189
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,711
750 million?

1190
01:04:32,173 --> 01:04:33,518
That's a big bluff

1191
01:04:34,941 --> 01:04:36,439
- Where?
- Sembikarai

1192
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,284
- Aiyaiyo...!
- Why?

1193
01:04:38,939 --> 01:04:40,245
Sir, that’s too far

1194
01:04:40,284 --> 01:04:42,206
Don’t you have anything nearby?

1195
01:04:42,283 --> 01:04:44,205
- Hey...!
- What?

1196
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,589
Ouch!

1197
01:04:46,903 --> 01:04:50,133
In Sembikarai, illegal money transfer
is the most 'happening' business

1198
01:04:50,171 --> 01:04:52,169
To convert black money to white...

1199
01:04:52,207 --> 01:04:54,015
...this 'hawala' is an easy route

1200
01:04:54,054 --> 01:04:55,553
Police, politicians, Government...

1201
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:58,397
...are all well aware
of these transactions

1202
01:04:58,514 --> 01:05:00,704
But all of them will turn a blind eye

1203
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,509
Because they may also have to come here
to convert their black money into white!

1204
01:05:06,854 --> 01:05:08,047
He’s Antony

1205
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:09,660
'Hawala' king of this town

1206
01:05:09,737 --> 01:05:12,544
Without his knowledge
not even 1 rupee through 'hawala'...

1207
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:15,157
...can exit or enter this town

1208
01:05:15,426 --> 01:05:19,732
His commission alone will run
into millions through this business

1209
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,460
This is his food storage factory

1210
01:05:22,577 --> 01:05:25,191
Money that comes
for his 'hawala' business...

1211
01:05:25,344 --> 01:05:26,883
...will be hidden here

1212
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:28,421
The money we intend stealing...

1213
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:29,919
...is also hidden here

1214
01:05:29,957 --> 01:05:31,342
Sir, where is the money?

1215
01:05:31,456 --> 01:05:32,572
Where are you taking me?

1216
01:05:33,532 --> 01:05:35,300
When is RK’s flight leaving?

1217
01:05:35,378 --> 01:05:36,685
Sir, 11.30 flight

1218
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:41,782
- Which flight?
- Lufthansa

1219
01:05:46,049 --> 01:05:47,125
Should I go in?

1220
01:05:48,163 --> 01:05:49,010
My God!

1221
01:05:49,047 --> 01:05:50,162
Sir, bundles of cash

1222
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:52,891
I’ve ever seen this much
piled up in my life, sir

1223
01:05:52,968 --> 01:05:54,430
How sad I can’t even touch it

1224
01:05:54,468 --> 01:05:56,774
Wish you had shown me
when I was alive, sir

1225
01:05:56,813 --> 01:05:59,234
After 'Mangatha' only now
 I’m seeing so much money

1226
01:05:59,273 --> 01:06:00,772
Sir, you're God!

1227
01:06:00,886 --> 01:06:02,771
Masss, cash stacked up
Worth millions

1228
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:03,732
Did you really see it?

1229
01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:06,077
I swear only today
I feel bad I'm dead

1230
01:06:06,154 --> 01:06:07,577
Unbelievable amount of money

1231
01:06:07,653 --> 01:06:09,498
But saddest thing is
I couldn't touch it

1232
01:06:09,536 --> 01:06:11,267
Let's loot all of it
 and settle abroad!

1233
01:06:11,459 --> 01:06:13,727
All that money isn’t yours

1234
01:06:13,842 --> 01:06:14,842
Aiyaiyo!

1235
01:06:14,919 --> 01:06:17,186
50% for me and 50% for you

1236
01:06:17,301 --> 01:06:18,955
That’ll do, sir

1237
01:06:19,032 --> 01:06:21,223
As soon as you get
 the money in your hands...

1238
01:06:21,261 --> 01:06:23,492
...you must tick only my wish list first

1239
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:25,874
Sir, we’ve got our hands dirty so often

1240
01:06:26,374 --> 01:06:27,759
Won't we do even this?

1241
01:06:28,142 --> 01:06:29,219
What do you say, dude?

1242
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,488
Dot!

1243
01:06:30,526 --> 01:06:33,139
If you tell us how to loot this cache...

1244
01:06:33,178 --> 01:06:34,177
...we can gate-crash

1245
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:39,098
Watch your step

1246
01:06:39,174 --> 01:06:41,751
Security will be less after 8:00 p.m

1247
01:06:41,904 --> 01:06:44,710
That's the right time
 for us to start our action

1248
01:06:45,441 --> 01:06:46,863
Wait! Someone is coming

1249
01:06:46,901 --> 01:06:48,207
I can hear someone

1250
01:06:48,285 --> 01:06:49,323
Who can see you?

1251
01:06:49,362 --> 01:06:50,169
Check and tell me

1252
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,823
Sorry, 'Memento' memory!

1253
01:06:57,089 --> 01:06:58,127
Step that side

1254
01:06:58,433 --> 01:06:59,471
Be careful

1255
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,662
Wait...wait

1256
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:04,931
Go...keep going

1257
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:07,698
- Masss, stay here
- Why?

1258
01:07:07,737 --> 01:07:08,776
Jet, stay with him

1259
01:07:08,814 --> 01:07:09,583
Come back fast

1260
01:07:09,621 --> 01:07:12,811
Masss, why did you agree
 to a 50-50 deal with him?

1261
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,233
Who the hell agreed?

1262
01:07:14,311 --> 01:07:15,579
Let's first grab the loot

1263
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:17,155
We'll help ourselves to 101%

1264
01:07:17,194 --> 01:07:18,539
Why do spirits need 50%?

1265
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:20,077
Someone is coming…go hide

1266
01:07:20,346 --> 01:07:22,883
Radha, when I’m there...

1267
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,537
...don’t worry about anything

1268
01:07:24,575 --> 01:07:25,804
You enjoy the trip

1269
01:07:25,843 --> 01:07:26,726
Bye bye

1270
01:07:26,995 --> 01:07:28,303
Only if you’re alive

1271
01:07:33,454 --> 01:07:35,068
Hey! Something is pulling me

1272
01:07:35,107 --> 01:07:36,990
It's dragging me

1273
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:38,220
What’s this?

1274
01:07:38,259 --> 01:07:39,258
Simply soooper

1275
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:42,141
Hey Vasu, tata!

1276
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,410
One more...one more

1277
01:07:46,447 --> 01:07:48,409
Super man

1278
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:52,790
I'll wait in the factory here

1279
01:07:53,405 --> 01:07:54,981
Okay, I myself will come there

1280
01:07:55,328 --> 01:07:56,711
Will be there in 20 minutes

1281
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:58,864
Mass...?

1282
01:07:58,902 --> 01:08:00,094
Hey! Where did you go?

1283
01:08:00,133 --> 01:08:01,171
I told you to wait there

1284
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:02,285
I was searching for you

1285
01:08:02,324 --> 01:08:03,285
Let’s go to the locker

1286
01:08:03,324 --> 01:08:04,437
Go that side…right there

1287
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:06,437
- It's over flowing with money
- I'll hit you

1288
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,282
Jet, is this the one?

1289
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:09,627
Punch 7693

1290
01:08:09,704 --> 01:08:11,972
Didn’t we see 7683 the other day?

1291
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:14,048
Listen to me…press 7693

1292
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:15,509
Which one of you is right?

1293
01:08:15,547 --> 01:08:16,932
I’m telling you, press 7693

1294
01:08:23,121 --> 01:08:24,774
We've sounded the alarm

1295
01:08:24,811 --> 01:08:25,888
He messed up

1296
01:08:25,965 --> 01:08:27,425
That’s it!

1297
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,309
Stop...stop...stop

1298
01:08:34,385 --> 01:08:35,614
What’s happening there?

1299
01:08:35,921 --> 01:08:37,113
Hey! What happened?

1300
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,381
What number did you say?

1301
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,111
The other day I saw him press 7683

1302
01:08:44,032 --> 01:08:45,378
Bingo!

1303
01:08:46,031 --> 01:08:46,647
Check inside

1304
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:47,800
Treasure trove

1305
01:08:49,146 --> 01:08:51,066
Jet, it's a mass of million new notes

1306
01:08:51,144 --> 01:08:52,451
What a haul!

1307
01:08:52,565 --> 01:08:53,835
750 million

1308
01:08:55,143 --> 01:08:56,257
Stuff it all in

1309
01:08:56,295 --> 01:08:57,602
Bombay, Delhi, Goa...????

1310
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,678
Masss, stop

1311
01:08:58,986 --> 01:09:00,216
Let's leave from here

1312
01:09:00,254 --> 01:09:02,023
Why did you give us the wrong number?

1313
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:03,638
In all the hurry-burry
I got confused

1314
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:04,791
Men are heading here

1315
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:06,482
Leave the money
Let’s escape now

1316
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,058
I’ll finish with this...I’m done

1317
01:09:08,096 --> 01:09:10,211
Mass, security is here

1318
01:09:12,672 --> 01:09:14,362
Jet, come to the back door

1319
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:16,093
Oh! You can’t do it

1320
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:18,745
Awww! Money

1321
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:19,707
We can take it later

1322
01:09:19,784 --> 01:09:20,745
I can hear the guards

1323
01:09:45,654 --> 01:09:46,731
Come this side, Mass

1324
01:09:46,768 --> 01:09:47,883
Hey! Stop

1325
01:09:48,845 --> 01:09:50,306
Run...run

1326
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:55,111
I lost all that money because of you

1327
01:09:55,148 --> 01:09:56,225
Messed it up big time

1328
01:09:56,302 --> 01:09:58,378
That's our money
We'll come back for it

1329
01:09:58,725 --> 01:09:59,915
Now your life is important!

1330
01:09:59,954 --> 01:10:00,683
You scumbag!

1331
01:10:00,723 --> 01:10:02,068
Mass, let’s first get out of here

1332
01:10:02,107 --> 01:10:03,414
All our efforts down the drain

1333
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:04,182
Come

1334
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,181
You bloody hoodlum!
I lost it all

1335
01:10:09,641 --> 01:10:10,909
Hey! Who are you?

1336
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,306
Stop

1337
01:10:35,113 --> 01:10:36,458
- Mass...
- What?

1338
01:10:36,497 --> 01:10:37,265
Take this car

1339
01:10:37,304 --> 01:10:38,918
I’ll deal with you later

1340
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:42,070
Jet, he almost made me a corpse

1341
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:43,686
- Start the car
- I'll torture him

1342
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:50,066
Ask him to get down

1343
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:51,912
Turn off the headlight and drive

1344
01:10:51,989 --> 01:10:53,910
How can I drive
without headlights?

1345
01:10:53,948 --> 01:10:54,949
I’ll take care of that

1346
01:10:54,986 --> 01:10:56,140
Yeah! The expert!!

1347
01:10:56,179 --> 01:10:57,985
Where’s he going?

1348
01:10:59,484 --> 01:11:00,830
Masss, he's on top of the car

1349
01:11:00,869 --> 01:11:01,790
Can’t see a thing

1350
01:11:01,828 --> 01:11:03,097
How to get out of here?

1351
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,712
Go straight...straight

1352
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:06,058
I said, go straight

1353
01:11:12,209 --> 01:11:13,170
Turn right

1354
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:14,707
Right here

1355
01:11:16,668 --> 01:11:17,474
Then...?

1356
01:11:17,589 --> 01:11:19,397
- Left...
- Turn left

1357
01:11:25,932 --> 01:11:26,894
Turn on the lights

1358
01:11:26,931 --> 01:11:27,663
Whaaat?

1359
01:11:27,738 --> 01:11:29,239
Switch on the headlights

1360
01:11:29,314 --> 01:11:30,738
Hey! Watch out

1361
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:43,461
Start the car
Let's leave this place

1362
01:11:43,538 --> 01:11:45,153
It's okay...go...go

1363
01:11:45,192 --> 01:11:46,691
Start the car...leave

1364
01:12:09,026 --> 01:12:10,870
You didn't expect, did you?

1365
01:12:11,908 --> 01:12:14,446
Didn't expect me
to come back, huh?

1366
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:18,712
Especially not like this, right?

1367
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:21,557
I’m here now

1368
01:12:22,518 --> 01:12:23,902
Now

1369
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:27,168
It's my fucking game!

1370
01:12:42,554 --> 01:12:44,397
I won't do this again, sir

1371
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:46,202
Forgive me, sir

1372
01:12:51,693 --> 01:12:53,344
All words, no work

1373
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:57,107
Sendhil does his job
after giving what's due to me

1374
01:12:57,222 --> 01:12:58,259
Are you such a big shot?

1375
01:12:58,336 --> 01:12:59,297
Are you Goundamani?

1376
01:12:59,335 --> 01:13:01,024
I'll make sure it doesn't
happen again, sir

1377
01:13:01,063 --> 01:13:03,905
To download his stuff you said
Sendhil has already lined my pocket

1378
01:13:03,943 --> 01:13:05,248
Are you a by-pass for us?

1379
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:06,900
I’ll pay whatever you ask

1380
01:13:06,937 --> 01:13:08,820
Isn't he promising
a better deal than him, sir?

1381
01:13:08,858 --> 01:13:11,508
Sasi, it isn't important
who gives the best deal

1382
01:13:11,586 --> 01:13:13,390
First is what counts

1383
01:13:13,428 --> 01:13:15,540
It means only the first guy
has full faith in us

1384
01:13:15,578 --> 01:13:17,421
Can we betray
the one who trusts us?

1385
01:13:17,421 --> 01:13:19,381
We shouldn't, right?

1386
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:22,107
Since I'm already
committed to him...

1387
01:13:23,988 --> 01:13:25,985
...I've decided to divorce this one

1388
01:13:26,024 --> 01:13:27,943
Spare me just this once, sir

1389
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:30,593
Yes, Ramya?

1390
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,206
Antony died in an accident

1391
01:13:32,513 --> 01:13:33,665
Antony?

1392
01:13:34,857 --> 01:13:36,200
- When?
- Last night, sir

1393
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:37,812
In his factory

1394
01:13:37,966 --> 01:13:39,388
I'm coming

1395
01:13:43,687 --> 01:13:45,608
Stupid of me to have trusted you

1396
01:13:45,761 --> 01:13:47,490
Even my fuel expenses
weren't covered

1397
01:13:47,566 --> 01:13:50,178
I was so happy minting money
with my gang of ghosts

1398
01:13:50,216 --> 01:13:53,825
You know Masss has earned much more
with spirits than producer C.V.Kumar

1399
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:55,784
Just shut up, you scumbag

1400
01:13:56,053 --> 01:13:58,128
I'm so bloody mad
If only you were alive-

1401
01:13:58,204 --> 01:13:59,279
Why are you so tensed?

1402
01:13:59,316 --> 01:14:00,200
Whaaaat?

1403
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:02,350
I have conned people,
robbed them but murder-

1404
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,771
I've never even thought of murder-

1405
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:04,771
Murder?

1406
01:14:04,963 --> 01:14:06,421
When did that happen?

1407
01:14:06,614 --> 01:14:08,264
Hey! Watch out

1408
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,252
Even if I had been a human
that driver would have killed me

1409
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:17,634
How will he know you'll jump?

1410
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:21,014
Same way, how did I know he'll dart
in front of the car all of a sudden?

1411
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:26,274
We aren't here to fight

1412
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:27,811
But to become a millionaire!

1413
01:14:27,849 --> 01:14:28,733
Millionaire, huh?

1414
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:29,923
Don't irritate me

1415
01:14:29,961 --> 01:14:31,497
You promised me 750 million

1416
01:14:31,573 --> 01:14:33,033
I didn't get a single rupee!

1417
01:14:34,339 --> 01:14:35,261
If you had got...

1418
01:14:35,376 --> 01:14:38,409
...you'd have vamoosed
taking the entire haul

1419
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:40,022
Aiyaiyo...!

1420
01:14:40,252 --> 01:14:42,980
Masss, I didn't say anything

1421
01:14:47,395 --> 01:14:51,389
You thought you could ruin
my own plan and deceive me?

1422
01:14:51,428 --> 01:14:52,540
That's my money

1423
01:14:53,001 --> 01:14:54,730
Wherever it goes
only we have to loot it

1424
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,573
Wait a moment

1425
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:01,103
Knowing I'll cheat you out of it
why did you ask me to steal?

1426
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:03,639
Your motive is not
to loot that locker?

1427
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:06,059
Masss, you've got me all wrong

1428
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:09,782
What was all that build up about
'my money 750 million' and 'hawala'-

1429
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:11,243
And you took us to Sembikarai

1430
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:12,241
Forget it, Masss

1431
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,316
Let's go back to Chennai

1432
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:15,468
We can mint money
with our gang of ghosts

1433
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:17,771
We can globetrot to Singapore,
Malaysia and have fun-

1434
01:15:17,771 --> 01:15:18,846
Aiyayiyo!

1435
01:15:18,884 --> 01:15:21,879
Car...over heat
I go check the oil

1436
01:15:21,879 --> 01:15:23,338
Masss, hear me out
and then talk

1437
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:25,335
I don't need to hear
 any of your lies

1438
01:15:25,412 --> 01:15:28,138
You planned it nice and proper,
made me kill for you

1439
01:15:28,216 --> 01:15:29,214
Happy now?

1440
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,442
This guy looking very scary

1441
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:31,364
I go hide

1442
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,322
Don't even stand in front of me

1443
01:15:33,361 --> 01:15:34,090
What the-

1444
01:15:34,205 --> 01:15:35,090
Just go

1445
01:15:37,278 --> 01:15:39,505
I must face the consequences
Who will blame you?

1446
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:41,156
Do you have someone to turn to?

1447
01:15:52,985 --> 01:15:54,751
Dad, whenever I ask you...

1448
01:15:54,788 --> 01:15:57,554
...you always say, 'I'll think about it'

1449
01:15:57,707 --> 01:15:59,282
Anu is very good

1450
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,854
She's very good at magic

1451
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:04,428
How many kids can boast
of a magician-mom, dad?

1452
01:16:04,465 --> 01:16:05,503
Please

1453
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:08,152
Let's take her home, dad

1454
01:16:08,191 --> 01:16:09,495
Please, dad

1455
01:16:09,535 --> 01:16:11,378
Let's go home
and talk about this

1456
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:12,184
No way, dad

1457
01:16:12,223 --> 01:16:15,986
Only if you accept her
 I'll talk to you

1458
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,978
Mom has gone to heaven, right?

1459
01:16:21,171 --> 01:16:22,476
I'll ask her and
let you know

1460
01:16:22,515 --> 01:16:23,897
Don't lie, dad

1461
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:26,469
Has mom ever talked to you?

1462
01:16:26,507 --> 01:16:28,082
She talks only to me

1463
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:30,349
Let me ask her right now

1464
01:16:32,307 --> 01:16:33,420
Mom?

1465
01:16:33,497 --> 01:16:36,722
Mummy...!

1466
01:16:47,283 --> 01:16:50,317
Dad, mom said she likes her

1467
01:16:50,432 --> 01:16:53,658
She asked you to marry her

1468
01:16:54,195 --> 01:16:55,732
Hey! What happened to my Megha?

1469
01:16:55,808 --> 01:16:56,960
Don't carry me, dad

1470
01:16:59,149 --> 01:17:01,069
'Shakthi, what does Anu lack?'

1471
01:17:01,722 --> 01:17:03,834
'She loves you both very much'

1472
01:17:04,103 --> 01:17:06,714
'Megha won't get
a better mother than Anu'

1473
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:08,020
Megha...?

1474
01:17:08,365 --> 01:17:09,517
Look at me

1475
01:17:13,549 --> 01:17:15,624
Princess, do you like her?

1476
01:17:15,815 --> 01:17:19,309
I love her very much, dad

1477
01:17:21,422 --> 01:17:22,573
My precious princess!

1478
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:25,262
If my daughter likes her...

1479
01:17:25,799 --> 01:17:26,913
...so will her dad!

1480
01:17:27,412 --> 01:17:28,603
Aunty...?

1481
01:17:28,718 --> 01:17:30,676
Dad said 'yes'

1482
01:17:32,519 --> 01:17:33,365
Where is-

1483
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:37,012
"I am not her"

1484
01:17:37,473 --> 01:17:40,314
"I am not the mother
of your daughter"

1485
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:47,496
“In good looks or character
Any of these, I’m not her”

1486
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:50,913
“I fell in love with you”

1487
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:58,555
“Will you make me bloom
in your sky as the second moon?”

1488
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:04,469
“Will you let me blossom?”

1489
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:12,419
“From where she left you
I’ll continue her journey anew”

1490
01:18:13,031 --> 01:18:14,875
Dad, look...mom

1491
01:18:34,268 --> 01:18:40,911
“But love, honey
listen to my plea”

1492
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:48,169
“In my heart where she rested
I hesitate to let you stay instead”

1493
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:54,736
“But my love
let me say this now”

1494
01:18:55,657 --> 01:19:02,070
“The world my wife left behind
with you I’m trying to find”

1495
01:19:02,569 --> 01:19:07,792
“In my sky you snowed
as a silver lined cloud”

1496
01:19:09,673 --> 01:19:16,240
“Like the light blue sky gently
you spread into my heart perfectly”

1497
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:23,306
“In my earth as a plant
you flowered permanent”

1498
01:19:23,728 --> 01:19:30,488
“Like the lush evergreen forest
you covered every inch of my heart”

1499
01:19:30,871 --> 01:19:34,481
“I smile again thanks to you
with a twinkle in my eyes true”

1500
01:19:34,635 --> 01:19:37,822
“I reopened my life
All because of you, my wife”

1501
01:19:38,091 --> 01:19:44,964
"Still in my past, as an outcast
I searched for the path I had lost"

1502
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:51,263
“But my love so true
listen to my point of view”

1503
01:19:52,299 --> 01:19:57,560
“In my heart where she nestled
to let you settle..."

1504
01:19:57,944 --> 01:19:59,365
"To let you inside
to reside"

1505
01:20:27,552 --> 01:20:30,547
“Before belonging to me formally"

1506
01:20:30,624 --> 01:20:33,887
"You became my child’s mother informally”

1507
01:20:33,925 --> 01:20:37,574
“Before I could ask you why, my dear”

1508
01:20:37,728 --> 01:20:40,683
“You whispered with kisses in my ear”

1509
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:44,217
“Into your lap you kidnapped me, darling"

1510
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:48,211
"Weaving your fingers in my hair lingering”

1511
01:20:49,631 --> 01:20:54,892
“With your unconditional love, dear
my scars healed and disappeared”

1512
01:20:55,506 --> 01:20:56,428
Listen, dad

1513
01:20:56,466 --> 01:21:02,842
All my friends play with
their brothers and sisters, dad

1514
01:21:02,918 --> 01:21:04,877
Even I want to play like that

1515
01:21:05,029 --> 01:21:08,525
I want a little brother
or sister soon, dad

1516
01:21:08,679 --> 01:21:11,289
Go and ask your mom

1517
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:13,517
Amma...?

1518
01:21:13,747 --> 01:21:15,014
I am okay

1519
01:21:17,932 --> 01:21:19,124
Our daughter's wish

1520
01:21:19,315 --> 01:21:23,079
"Darling, you are my everything"

1521
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:24,923
"My silver moon wife"

1522
01:21:25,037 --> 01:21:26,881
"My soul mate for life"

1523
01:21:26,996 --> 01:21:29,069
"My dream without strife"

1524
01:21:30,376 --> 01:21:36,904
"You’re my world, darling
You’re my joy, my everything"

1525
01:21:37,287 --> 01:21:39,091
"You are my heart and heartbeat"

1526
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,935
"Hereafter my journey complete"

1527
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:43,163
"For ever after my world replete"

1528
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,615
I'm in a meeting
I'll call later

1529
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:38,960
Antony 'anna' passed away, bro

1530
01:22:38,998 --> 01:22:40,496
- When?
- Last night

1531
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:41,763
1 minute

1532
01:22:46,832 --> 01:22:47,753
What are you saying?

1533
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:48,982
Yes, bro

1534
01:22:49,404 --> 01:22:51,400
Antony 'anna' died in an accident

1535
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:52,975
In his factory, bro

1536
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:53,897
Accident?

1537
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:55,855
We are not yet sure
if it’s an accident or murder

1538
01:22:55,972 --> 01:22:57,968
I've interrogated all the workers

1539
01:22:58,006 --> 01:22:59,695
No one is coming forward to complain

1540
01:22:59,772 --> 01:23:03,420
But we got information that Antony's car
is hidden near Ambuli lake

1541
01:23:03,536 --> 01:23:06,146
A car here has run over Antony
and vanished into thin air

1542
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:09,795
Antony's car is hidden in a corner
on the banks of the lake over there

1543
01:23:13,789 --> 01:23:15,555
Executed with clockwork precision

1544
01:23:15,594 --> 01:23:17,514
Is it the handiwork of
an individual or a gang?

1545
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:18,974
That is the question

1546
01:23:21,814 --> 01:23:23,926
Why was this factory
their specific target?

1547
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,884
It seems Antony anna's locker has
neither the money nor any documents

1548
01:23:26,999 --> 01:23:27,959
Are you playing the fool?

1549
01:23:27,998 --> 01:23:28,957
How can it disappear?

1550
01:23:42,513 --> 01:23:44,624
Did you think the documents
were just blank papers?

1551
01:23:44,663 --> 01:23:47,236
Money amassed by the minister
for 25 years by trampling lives

1552
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:50,270
Details of which container has what
and which ship carries it

1553
01:23:50,347 --> 01:23:51,844
Destination of that particular ship

1554
01:23:51,844 --> 01:23:52,611
Date of arrival

1555
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:54,224
All the goddamn details are in there

1556
01:23:54,532 --> 01:23:56,836
Who has the guts to come
To Sembikarai and loot all this?

1557
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,372
You think it is a local job?

1558
01:23:58,411 --> 01:23:59,255
Definitely, sir

1559
01:23:59,564 --> 01:24:01,099
Definitely not

1560
01:24:01,137 --> 01:24:01,943
- No?
- Yes

1561
01:24:02,865 --> 01:24:05,669
Maybe your parents named you Ramya
looking at your beautiful smile

1562
01:24:10,967 --> 01:24:12,234
Such a huge locker

1563
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:13,925
Wonder what was stored inside?

1564
01:24:14,002 --> 01:24:15,268
Full of black money

1565
01:24:15,307 --> 01:24:16,613
If it gets into the wrong hands

1566
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:17,957
Customs or harbor officials

1567
01:24:17,994 --> 01:24:18,917
We are done for

1568
01:24:18,994 --> 01:24:20,414
Don't worry
I'll handle it

1569
01:24:20,491 --> 01:24:21,913
Before I get back to India...

1570
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:23,294
...it should be retrieved

1571
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:24,254
Catch the thief also

1572
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:25,099
Done deal

1573
01:24:25,138 --> 01:24:27,366
Sir, we can find out by
checking the CC TV camera

1574
01:24:27,441 --> 01:24:28,978
Is he running a software company?

1575
01:24:29,016 --> 01:24:30,284
He's up to his neck in deceit

1576
01:24:30,284 --> 01:24:31,896
As if he'll have a witness at hand

1577
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:34,086
There's no CC TV in this factory

1578
01:24:34,162 --> 01:24:35,775
That's why I stuck this camera here

1579
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:38,156
Sir, how did you manage that?

1580
01:24:38,232 --> 01:24:40,921
I spat a chewing gum here
and stuck it on top

1581
01:24:42,879 --> 01:24:45,722
I thought I could catch Antony
and milk the maximum out of him

1582
01:24:45,722 --> 01:24:48,370
Now I don't know which cow
will be the scapegoat to milk

1583
01:24:48,447 --> 01:24:49,983
Let's see if we find
Antony's killer

1584
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:54,130
Like Manik Baashha, Robin Hood-Don
in 'Baashha', he may be captured in this

1585
01:24:54,207 --> 01:24:55,282
Who was on the phone?

1586
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,665
Madhi had called

1587
01:24:56,896 --> 01:24:58,124
I wanted to ask you myself

1588
01:24:58,163 --> 01:25:00,044
What stage is our money in?

1589
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:02,040
You've trusted me
It will be 100% alright

1590
01:25:02,387 --> 01:25:04,729
You finish our business deal
properly signed and sealed

1591
01:25:04,883 --> 01:25:06,073
Don't worry about the money

1592
01:25:06,112 --> 01:25:06,956
My responsibility

1593
01:25:06,995 --> 01:25:10,220
RK, I want this money in Delhi
before the election campaign starts

1594
01:25:10,259 --> 01:25:13,523
Because this is the only chance
for me to launder all of it

1595
01:25:13,561 --> 01:25:16,135
It will be delivered in the place
and time you specify

1596
01:25:25,658 --> 01:25:26,810
'Back' means rewind

1597
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:30,996
Whom is he talking to
all by himself?

1598
01:25:31,649 --> 01:25:33,337
He isn't Antony's henchman

1599
01:25:33,414 --> 01:25:34,874
Nor does he belong to Sembikarai

1600
01:25:34,951 --> 01:25:38,138
But on the day Antony died
why was he in his factory?

1601
01:25:38,446 --> 01:25:41,363
Sir, his photo has matched
our Tamil Nadu police list

1602
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:42,439
His name is Masilamani

1603
01:25:42,516 --> 01:25:45,818
He's in the accused list in Vyasarpadi,
Perambur and Thousand Light

1604
01:25:45,934 --> 01:25:47,777
But for some time now
he has been silent, sir

1605
01:25:47,814 --> 01:25:49,812
If such fellows are silent...

1606
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:51,694
...they are planning
a heist in a large scale

1607
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:54,229
Record this as just an accident
in our First Information Report

1608
01:25:54,267 --> 01:25:55,150
Okay, sir

1609
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:55,956
She should say it

1610
01:25:55,994 --> 01:25:57,147
- Okay, sir
- I like that

1611
01:25:57,416 --> 01:26:01,217
Other than us, no one else should be
aware of this fellow's involvement

1612
01:26:01,909 --> 01:26:03,483
Who is he?

1613
01:26:03,675 --> 01:26:04,712
Where is he now?

1614
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:06,670
Who is giving him the orders?

1615
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:09,281
How is he connected with Antony?

1616
01:26:09,896 --> 01:26:11,316
We should go to Chennai

1617
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:25,103
Only if they are happy
they can help us

1618
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,407
You mean 'your' happiness!

1619
01:26:26,485 --> 01:26:28,635
- Look how happy our Jet is
- Did he tell you?

1620
01:26:28,712 --> 01:26:30,901
Because he doesn't rub
Masss sir the wrong way

1621
01:26:31,016 --> 01:26:31,939
That's why he is happy

1622
01:26:32,015 --> 01:26:33,397
Hey! What's the problem, Jet?

1623
01:26:33,475 --> 01:26:34,971
Boss, you go and freshen up

1624
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:36,201
I'll convince all of them here

1625
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:38,120
Shut up, man
Forever over acting

1626
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:39,043
Me...over act?

1627
01:26:39,081 --> 01:26:43,036
Masss, they won't work
for us anymore it seems

1628
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:44,726
They are going on a strike

1629
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,257
Internal revolt

1630
01:26:49,717 --> 01:26:51,829
Hereafter we won't do
whatever you say

1631
01:26:51,983 --> 01:26:53,058
Fine with me

1632
01:26:53,097 --> 01:26:55,555
Given a chance you'll start
a separate union for spirits

1633
01:26:55,594 --> 01:26:57,052
Did I come looking for you?

1634
01:26:57,359 --> 01:26:58,549
You came after me

1635
01:26:59,164 --> 01:27:00,969
Jet, all this won't work

1636
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:02,659
Chase all of them out

1637
01:27:02,774 --> 01:27:04,503
We bring fresh ghosts in tomorrow

1638
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:05,653
We start a fresh business

1639
01:27:05,692 --> 01:27:07,344
We don't need anyone
who disobeys us

1640
01:27:07,382 --> 01:27:08,187
Tell them to get out

1641
01:27:08,227 --> 01:27:09,801
You heard it from your boss

1642
01:27:09,878 --> 01:27:11,991
Only the spirits who have
faith in us stay behind

1643
01:27:12,029 --> 01:27:12,988
Rest of you, get out!

1644
01:27:14,371 --> 01:27:16,636
Whether we should stay here or not...

1645
01:27:16,867 --> 01:27:18,519
...you shouldn't be deciding

1646
01:27:19,364 --> 01:27:20,860
We want to hear it from him

1647
01:27:21,052 --> 01:27:21,820
Who?

1648
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:23,203
Turn and see for yourself

1649
01:27:32,381 --> 01:27:34,954
Hey! Didn't I tell you
not to see me ever again?

1650
01:27:35,032 --> 01:27:36,029
Why did you come here?

1651
01:27:36,144 --> 01:27:37,949
Hello...he didn't come

1652
01:27:37,987 --> 01:27:39,025
We called him

1653
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:42,903
God above takes care of
the homeless and the needy

1654
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:46,359
But abandoned spirits can
look up only to Mr Shakthi

1655
01:27:46,398 --> 01:27:48,126
Madam, our story was
going smooth, no?

1656
01:27:48,126 --> 01:27:49,892
Why this sudden
profound punch line?

1657
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:52,081
Sonny, what she says
 is 100% true

1658
01:27:52,119 --> 01:27:54,692
They made use of us
and when we need help...

1659
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:57,188
...they are kicking us out ruthlessly

1660
01:27:57,304 --> 01:28:00,452
Yes sonny, only you can
ask for justice on our behalf

1661
01:28:00,721 --> 01:28:03,640
Looks like you'll start off on
dialogs from yesteryear classics!

1662
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,176
Get out if that's what you want

1663
01:28:08,285 --> 01:28:09,744
Don't create a scene, just go

1664
01:28:11,973 --> 01:28:13,393
- Masss?
- What?

1665
01:28:13,470 --> 01:28:15,083
We've just started earning

1666
01:28:15,352 --> 01:28:16,926
Imagine if we have
to find a fresh lot

1667
01:28:16,926 --> 01:28:18,232
And train those spirits all over

1668
01:28:18,232 --> 01:28:20,190
Do we need to go
into all that trouble again?

1669
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:22,340
Bad enough we've killed
some stranger for him

1670
01:28:22,417 --> 01:28:23,761
Give it a thought, Masss

1671
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:24,990
Should we pack them off?

1672
01:28:26,526 --> 01:28:27,410
Hey! Wait

1673
01:28:27,448 --> 01:28:28,716
Wait, you supernatural powers

1674
01:28:28,946 --> 01:28:31,903
If someone new calls you
you'll run behind him, huh?

1675
01:28:32,172 --> 01:28:33,899
Chinna...what?

1676
01:28:34,168 --> 01:28:36,011
Hey! Azhagu...?

1677
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:37,663
Is our bond so shallow?

1678
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:40,043
I thought we belong to
one big happy family

1679
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,849
Sripathy...?

1680
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,615
- Is our bond so flimsy?
- No, boss

1681
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:46,342
- Be with him and do what?
- Don't know, boss

1682
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:48,646
In the end only I'll come to your aid

1683
01:28:48,684 --> 01:28:49,721
Forget it, Masss

1684
01:28:49,836 --> 01:28:51,526
Do you know what he did?

1685
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:53,752
He turned me into a murderer

1686
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,980
He planned it and made me a killer

1687
01:28:57,132 --> 01:28:58,745
Selling salt to the sea, huh?

1688
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:00,280
Now what?

1689
01:29:00,473 --> 01:29:01,701
You think I won't help

1690
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:03,122
...and I'll cheat all of you?

1691
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:05,311
That's your doubt?

1692
01:29:06,309 --> 01:29:07,002
Tell them

1693
01:29:08,421 --> 01:29:10,150
What should I do
and to whom?

1694
01:29:10,265 --> 01:29:12,338
Come forward, this is
priority for me now

1695
01:29:12,416 --> 01:29:13,837
Which one of you needs my help?

1696
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:15,181
Padma, go

1697
01:29:15,412 --> 01:29:16,600
Elders or ladies?

1698
01:29:16,717 --> 01:29:17,715
Who is he to decide?

1699
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:18,406
Ladies first

1700
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:19,443
Tell me, madam

1701
01:29:19,481 --> 01:29:21,133
What should I do for you?

1702
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:23,897
I want to see my son

1703
01:29:29,361 --> 01:29:31,425
"Braving chariotry, elephantry
cavalry and infantry"

1704
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,804
"Like a tempest voluntary
he can strike with his gallantry"

1705
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:36,850
"Like mountains massive
with his shoulders protective"

1706
01:29:36,886 --> 01:29:39,123
"With his bravery
he can wipe out the artillery"

1707
01:30:00,085 --> 01:30:01,835
Good life comes only after you die!

1708
01:30:01,835 --> 01:30:03,058
Enjoy, dude

1709
01:30:05,123 --> 01:30:09,637
A new South Indian lady in our area

1710
01:30:12,191 --> 01:30:13,557
What, my dear?

1711
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:14,571
New to this area?

1712
01:30:15,762 --> 01:30:16,671
No

1713
01:30:17,337 --> 01:30:18,315
Who this fellow?

1714
01:30:21,219 --> 01:30:22,934
All these days I've been
 waiting to meet you

1715
01:30:22,934 --> 01:30:24,405
Promising to introduce them to you...

1716
01:30:24,405 --> 01:30:26,994
...I've been 'managing' many girls
in America, Canada, Holland

1717
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:28,428
Hold on, I'll call them

1718
01:30:28,463 --> 01:30:29,408
Angelina...Amy

1719
01:30:29,442 --> 01:30:31,509
Already there are enough spirits
 waiting in the queue

1720
01:30:31,543 --> 01:30:33,257
We can deal with
 international ghosts in part 2

1721
01:30:33,292 --> 01:30:33,921
Hey! Shut up

1722
01:30:33,921 --> 01:30:34,937
I need a favor from you

1723
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:40,580
This madam's son is missing

1724
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,155
Name is Ganesh
Just a kid

1725
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:43,905
I believe he's here in
 in this area somewhere

1726
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,060
Have you seen him?

1727
01:30:46,425 --> 01:30:47,614
Wretched fellow!

1728
01:30:50,059 --> 01:30:51,319
Do you know Ganesh or not?

1729
01:30:52,718 --> 01:30:53,349
Move aside

1730
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:55,344
As far as I know, in this area...

1731
01:30:55,344 --> 01:30:57,337
...my assistant Krishnamurthy
of 'Naan Kadavul' fame

1732
01:30:57,337 --> 01:30:59,088
...does big time business
with the handicapped

1733
01:30:59,122 --> 01:31:00,347
Her son Ganesh should be there

1734
01:31:00,382 --> 01:31:01,781
Follow me...come on

1735
01:31:02,026 --> 01:31:03,601
This place used to be
a paradise on earth

1736
01:31:03,636 --> 01:31:04,930
It's gone to the dogs now

1737
01:31:05,876 --> 01:31:06,646
Leave now

1738
01:31:09,915 --> 01:31:11,524
- Get up
- I'm hungry, bro

1739
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,730
Eat at the place
where you beg

1740
01:31:13,765 --> 01:31:15,269
Is he your son Ganesh?

1741
01:31:19,468 --> 01:31:20,344
Is he your-

1742
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,065
Here...eat

1743
01:31:39,363 --> 01:31:40,729
What happened to your hand?

1744
01:31:40,764 --> 01:31:43,318
A man-hole on the street
was left open yesterday

1745
01:31:43,352 --> 01:31:44,998
I slipped and fell inside

1746
01:31:45,662 --> 01:31:47,691
Bro, I'm hungry
Can I eat?

1747
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:49,127
Eat

1748
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,390
He can't even see

1749
01:31:55,425 --> 01:31:56,825
How can we leave him alone-

1750
01:31:59,329 --> 01:32:00,204
Where's his dad?

1751
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,078
When he was born-

1752
01:32:01,113 --> 01:32:02,409
I had jaundice when I was young...

1753
01:32:02,409 --> 01:32:03,598
...and lost my eyesight

1754
01:32:03,668 --> 01:32:06,643
So my dad left me and my mother

1755
01:32:06,713 --> 01:32:08,497
If only I had been with him-

1756
01:32:08,532 --> 01:32:09,442
Hey! Stop it

1757
01:32:09,442 --> 01:32:10,562
Don't give excuses

1758
01:32:10,597 --> 01:32:12,066
You'll have a baby
because of your desires

1759
01:32:12,137 --> 01:32:13,152
Making up stupid excuses

1760
01:32:13,222 --> 01:32:13,992
Bro, what happened?

1761
01:32:14,027 --> 01:32:14,795
Silly excuses

1762
01:32:15,951 --> 01:32:17,070
Nothing...nothing

1763
01:32:17,105 --> 01:32:17,875
I got a call

1764
01:32:18,715 --> 01:32:20,780
Do you know how tough it is
to grow up as an orphan?

1765
01:32:20,885 --> 01:32:22,144
I'm also like him

1766
01:32:25,114 --> 01:32:26,374
'I was younger than him'

1767
01:32:28,053 --> 01:32:31,027
'We ate the food dumped
as waste by kids my age'

1768
01:32:31,552 --> 01:32:33,547
'Jet and I would sleep
wherever we found a place'

1769
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:35,891
Easy to say 'would've taken
better care if I had been alive'

1770
01:32:35,962 --> 01:32:36,837
But you weren't with him

1771
01:32:37,467 --> 01:32:38,305
Look at him

1772
01:32:38,935 --> 01:32:39,741
Hunger

1773
01:32:40,231 --> 01:32:41,036
He's now begging

1774
01:32:41,665 --> 01:32:42,820
What's the rush?

1775
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:47,530
Why the hell did you die?

1776
01:32:57,607 --> 01:32:59,427
Masss, let's go to Goa

1777
01:32:59,637 --> 01:33:00,616
- Why?
- Slow down

1778
01:33:02,121 --> 01:33:03,276
Why are you driving like this?

1779
01:33:03,975 --> 01:33:05,340
Ma...maa?

1780
01:33:05,865 --> 01:33:07,230
Ma, where are you?

1781
01:33:07,335 --> 01:33:09,190
Ma, say something

1782
01:33:09,926 --> 01:33:11,674
Ma...?

1783
01:33:11,813 --> 01:33:13,109
Please say something

1784
01:33:13,388 --> 01:33:15,838
Ma, where are you?

1785
01:33:29,181 --> 01:33:30,755
'I have robbed people
Even conned them'

1786
01:33:30,825 --> 01:33:32,506
'But I've never ever
 thought of murderin-'

1787
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:42,792
I'll also be with him, doctor

1788
01:33:44,027 --> 01:33:45,637
Somehow restore his vision, doctor

1789
01:33:51,321 --> 01:33:53,001
Sister...sister...listen

1790
01:33:53,035 --> 01:33:54,784
Masss 'anna' has brought a blind boy

1791
01:33:54,854 --> 01:33:56,744
He is discussing about
treatment with Dr Deepak

1792
01:33:56,815 --> 01:33:58,109
That's it...gone!

1793
01:33:58,214 --> 01:34:00,209
He'll enact a drama
and cheat that doctor

1794
01:34:02,063 --> 01:34:03,603
- How is he?
- He's fine

1795
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:04,757
He'll be able to see, I hope?

1796
01:34:04,827 --> 01:34:06,542
His optical nerves aren't damaged

1797
01:34:07,383 --> 01:34:09,270
It's okay whatever be the cost

1798
01:34:09,306 --> 01:34:11,301
If someone donates an eye for him...

1799
01:34:11,336 --> 01:34:12,805
...a simple surgery
can fix the problem

1800
01:34:12,805 --> 01:34:13,821
Who will donate an eye-

1801
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:14,485
Don't worry

1802
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:17,669
Nowadays many register
 their eyes for donation and die

1803
01:34:17,704 --> 01:34:19,070
If we can find a match
for his eyes...

1804
01:34:19,105 --> 01:34:20,574
...we can definitely
restore his vision

1805
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:25,598
Please go to the reception
and finish all the formalities

1806
01:34:25,808 --> 01:34:27,488
- Please take care
- Sure, don't worry

1807
01:34:48,993 --> 01:34:49,868
Masss

1808
01:34:52,072 --> 01:34:53,857
I believe Ganesh will be
able to see very soon

1809
01:34:53,892 --> 01:34:55,642
Doctor told me just now
You don't worry

1810
01:34:55,957 --> 01:34:58,231
I swear I didn't do it deliberately

1811
01:34:58,266 --> 01:34:59,561
Why are you feeling guilty, Masss?

1812
01:34:59,911 --> 01:35:01,451
Even if I had been alive...

1813
01:35:01,661 --> 01:35:04,530
...I don't know if Ganesh
would've got his eyesight back

1814
01:35:04,599 --> 01:35:06,804
Maybe that's why I died

1815
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:09,299
I trust you, Masss

1816
01:35:09,474 --> 01:35:11,959
You'll take better care
 of my son than me

1817
01:35:12,449 --> 01:35:13,463
I swear-

1818
01:35:13,884 --> 01:35:15,352
I am happy, believe me

1819
01:35:17,067 --> 01:35:18,432
I'm the one who should thank you

1820
01:35:19,167 --> 01:35:20,322
Please don't thank me

1821
01:35:21,721 --> 01:35:22,701
Madam...?

1822
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:26,550
Don't go

1823
01:35:27,075 --> 01:35:28,545
Please stay

1824
01:35:30,259 --> 01:35:31,274
Madam...wait

1825
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:38,643
Your son will be able to see...

1826
01:35:39,763 --> 01:35:40,778
...after all these years-

1827
01:35:40,813 --> 01:35:44,486
"With birth as the fishing tackle"

1828
01:35:44,521 --> 01:35:45,956
"With life as the worm to dangle"

1829
01:35:46,131 --> 01:35:47,811
Mass, what should we do now?

1830
01:35:48,127 --> 01:35:50,926
What you've done till now
 is more than enough

1831
01:35:50,961 --> 01:35:53,724
Tell me, whom should I help next?

1832
01:35:54,844 --> 01:35:57,853
"With death as a metaphor to sky"

1833
01:35:58,484 --> 01:36:01,807
"Before we sprout wings to fly"

1834
01:36:01,913 --> 01:36:08,456
"One last dying wish alone
to be realized we yearn"

1835
01:36:09,821 --> 01:36:12,936
'I must propose to the girl
 I fell in love with, Masss'

1836
01:36:33,817 --> 01:36:39,239
"This dream sequined
in whose eyes who has lined?"

1837
01:36:39,345 --> 01:36:41,095
This is my girl
I showed you her photo

1838
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:47,393
"If it dissolves half way,
 won’t it continue to display"

1839
01:36:47,813 --> 01:36:52,398
"In heart’s dormitory
who has sown this memory?"

1840
01:36:52,467 --> 01:36:53,901
I want to kiss her, Masss

1841
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:59,746
"Even if time tramples them
won't the cherished memories blossom?"

1842
01:37:02,405 --> 01:37:08,843
"With birth as fishing tackle
and life as a worm to dangle"

1843
01:37:09,403 --> 01:37:14,827
"Of our own accord we get lured
Listing a few wishes to be fulfilled"

1844
01:37:16,366 --> 01:37:22,701
"With death as a metaphor to sky
before we sprout wings to fly"

1845
01:37:23,190 --> 01:37:29,420
"One last dying wish alone
to be realized we yearn"

1846
01:37:55,368 --> 01:38:02,297
"The magic of the tear that dissolves
before it drops from the eyes' alcoves"

1847
01:38:02,682 --> 01:38:09,645
"Hurt and heart ache, smile eclipses
before the teardrop reaches the lips"

1848
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:16,539
"Lost love in depths of sorrow immersed
when not promptly expressed"

1849
01:38:16,609 --> 01:38:22,838
"Kisses not imprinted, a zillion
wilted into vacillating oblivion"

1850
01:38:23,434 --> 01:38:24,902
The boy has got a match

1851
01:38:24,937 --> 01:38:26,057
We can operate at once

1852
01:38:26,232 --> 01:38:27,316
Probably in the next 2 weeks...

1853
01:38:27,351 --> 01:38:28,751
...he should be able to see very well

1854
01:38:28,751 --> 01:38:29,871
Knowing he'll be able to see...

1855
01:38:29,906 --> 01:38:31,026
...I'm more thrilled than him

1856
01:38:31,061 --> 01:38:32,985
Malini, in that application form...

1857
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:34,385
... include sir's name as guardian

1858
01:38:37,905 --> 01:38:39,409
Wait here, I'll come back
with the papers

1859
01:38:39,409 --> 01:38:40,494
I need to talk to you alone

1860
01:38:40,494 --> 01:38:41,334
Why?

1861
01:38:42,139 --> 01:38:43,609
You wait here
 I'll be back

1862
01:38:44,028 --> 01:38:45,988
I have work to-

1863
01:38:46,967 --> 01:38:49,276
Sir... I need to talk to you

1864
01:38:49,311 --> 01:38:50,536
- Wait
- Sir...sir

1865
01:38:50,607 --> 01:38:52,391
I was the one who
donated my eyes to that boy

1866
01:38:52,461 --> 01:38:53,686
Oh! Thanks

1867
01:38:53,721 --> 01:38:54,596
Thanks a lo-

1868
01:39:10,726 --> 01:39:13,422
‘How much love we showered on you’

1869
01:39:13,527 --> 01:39:15,416
‘You've left us and gone now’

1870
01:39:29,913 --> 01:39:30,823
Thanks a lot, bro

1871
01:39:30,894 --> 01:39:33,028
My heart feels much lighter now

1872
01:39:33,097 --> 01:39:34,392
Why are you thanking me, sir?

1873
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,492
My girl friend Manimekalai
is the main reason behind this

1874
01:39:36,527 --> 01:39:38,417
When she asked me to register
for organ donation...

1875
01:39:38,452 --> 01:39:39,502
...I was so scared!

1876
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:41,985
But today when I know
 I saved so many lives...

1877
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,540
...I feel so happy and proud, sir

1878
01:39:44,609 --> 01:39:46,080
I must to do something for you

1879
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:47,620
Do you have any desires, brother?

1880
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:48,949
After the boy's vision is restored...

1881
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,244
...please take him to Manimekalai

1882
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:51,994
If you tell her he is
seeing through my eyes...

1883
01:39:52,063 --> 01:39:53,498
...she'll be very happy

1884
01:39:53,603 --> 01:39:55,424
Definitely, I'll do that

1885
01:39:55,494 --> 01:39:56,682
Thanks, see you, sir

1886
01:39:59,517 --> 01:40:00,567
1 minute

1887
01:40:00,567 --> 01:40:02,701
You are going without seeing
 how happy Manimekalai will be

1888
01:40:02,737 --> 01:40:04,311
I know you'll do it

1889
01:40:04,345 --> 01:40:05,430
I'll anyway be seeing it

1890
01:40:05,501 --> 01:40:06,375
See you, brother

1891
01:40:09,526 --> 01:40:12,639
"With birth as the fishing tackle"

1892
01:40:13,164 --> 01:40:15,963
"With life as a worm to dangle"

1893
01:40:16,489 --> 01:40:21,877
"Of our own accord we got lured
Listing a few wishes to be fulfilled"

1894
01:40:23,627 --> 01:40:26,916
"With death as a metaphor to sky"

1895
01:40:26,951 --> 01:40:29,890
"Before we sprout wings to fly"

1896
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:35,839
"One last dying wish alone
to be realized we yearn"

1897
01:40:43,672 --> 01:40:44,512
Don't cry, madam

1898
01:40:44,547 --> 01:40:45,212
I can't forget-

1899
01:40:45,247 --> 01:40:46,507
Take care
Call me anytime

1900
01:40:46,787 --> 01:40:47,872
I'm there for you

1901
01:40:47,907 --> 01:40:48,782
We'll take leave

1902
01:40:49,657 --> 01:40:50,881
See you, uncle

1903
01:40:53,186 --> 01:40:54,411
Malini...?

1904
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:57,000
Someone I know-

1905
01:40:57,035 --> 01:40:58,084
I just met them here

1906
01:40:58,154 --> 01:40:58,854
Bye

1907
01:40:59,623 --> 01:41:01,549
So you won't talk to me, right?

1908
01:41:01,653 --> 01:41:03,053
Aren't you avoiding me?

1909
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:03,964
Not like that

1910
01:41:04,068 --> 01:41:06,727
The other day in the hospital
I told you to wait for me

1911
01:41:06,797 --> 01:41:07,672
But you left

1912
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,122
That means you don't
wish to speak to me

1913
01:41:12,262 --> 01:41:14,431
That day...some urgent work cropped-

1914
01:41:14,466 --> 01:41:15,726
You are not like before Masss

1915
01:41:16,845 --> 01:41:18,595
The moment you wanted
a blind boy to see...

1916
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:19,820
...whom you've never set eyes on

1917
01:41:19,855 --> 01:41:21,324
...I knew how genuine you are

1918
01:41:22,129 --> 01:41:24,054
But only with me
you were so false

1919
01:41:24,229 --> 01:41:26,259
If you don't like me,
let me know, I'll go away

1920
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:29,278
It isn't like that

1921
01:41:29,313 --> 01:41:30,537
I don't know how to explain

1922
01:41:30,923 --> 01:41:32,252
Do you know
how much I love you?

1923
01:41:33,162 --> 01:41:34,913
When you walked off
in a huff the other day...

1924
01:41:34,947 --> 01:41:36,521
...I wanted to slap you,
pull you close to me

1925
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:37,396
...and kiss you

1926
01:41:39,991 --> 01:41:40,971
What stopped you?

1927
01:41:43,426 --> 01:41:44,161
What?

1928
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:45,160
She's fine with it

1929
01:41:45,195 --> 01:41:46,245
What are you waiting for?

1930
01:41:46,245 --> 01:41:47,364
You are not the Masss I know

1931
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:48,764
Slowed down too much in the 2nd half

1932
01:41:48,799 --> 01:41:49,919
This won't work

1933
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:54,527
Start the music

1934
01:42:11,603 --> 01:42:13,214
Masss, what's his last wish?

1935
01:42:13,214 --> 01:42:14,299
To dance for his own death!

1936
01:42:14,334 --> 01:42:15,767
Maybe he fulfilled
his wishes when alive

1937
01:42:15,767 --> 01:42:17,342
That's why he went up
as soon as he died

1938
01:42:17,377 --> 01:42:18,812
This is what you term as 'good death'

1939
01:42:22,452 --> 01:42:23,536
Masss...Masss

1940
01:42:23,571 --> 01:42:24,586
You indecent fellow!

1941
01:42:24,586 --> 01:42:25,601
Why did you come here?

1942
01:42:25,636 --> 01:42:26,931
Cops have come in search of you

1943
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,855
- Police?
- Yes

1944
01:42:29,346 --> 01:42:30,884
- Why are they here?
- I don't know

1945
01:42:31,794 --> 01:42:32,879
You go, I'll follow

1946
01:42:37,895 --> 01:42:39,012
Answer me

1947
01:42:39,713 --> 01:42:41,498
Sir, you haven't as yet
 asked me any question

1948
01:42:41,533 --> 01:42:42,512
Do you know Antony?

1949
01:42:42,547 --> 01:42:43,072
Anto-

1950
01:42:43,597 --> 01:42:45,836
Tell him you know editor Anthony

1951
01:42:46,221 --> 01:42:47,621
Antony-

1952
01:42:47,796 --> 01:42:50,105
If you look up, you can
see only an antenna, not Antony!

1953
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:53,465
Antony...I don't know

1954
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,584
So you don't know Antony

1955
01:42:54,829 --> 01:42:56,019
What are you doing nowadays?

1956
01:43:02,253 --> 01:43:03,092
I exorcise spirits, sir

1957
01:43:03,127 --> 01:43:03,757
What?

1958
01:43:04,072 --> 01:43:06,942
All these evil forces,
spirits, ghosts, ghouls...

1959
01:43:06,942 --> 01:43:08,762
...I talk to them and
 drive them away

1960
01:43:08,762 --> 01:43:09,952
Do they even exist nowadays?

1961
01:43:09,987 --> 01:43:10,651
Yes sir...then wha-

1962
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:11,316
Ramya?

1963
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,961
This is just a trick
to con people for money

1964
01:43:12,996 --> 01:43:14,115
Have you been to Sembikarai?

1965
01:43:14,151 --> 01:43:16,531
- Sembi...
- Karai

1966
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:17,545
Sembikarai

1967
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,000
I asked if you've been there?

1968
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:23,483
Tell him you've been there

1969
01:43:24,569 --> 01:43:25,969
Tell him you went regarding a spirit

1970
01:43:26,005 --> 01:43:28,102
I haven't even heard that name, sir

1971
01:43:28,137 --> 01:43:30,168
So you've never been to Sembikarai

1972
01:43:30,168 --> 01:43:31,812
I'm saying I've never
even heard that name

1973
01:43:31,812 --> 01:43:33,073
Then how could I've gone there?

1974
01:43:37,621 --> 01:43:38,671
Can I get water please?

1975
01:43:38,775 --> 01:43:39,896
Sure, I'll get you

1976
01:43:42,764 --> 01:43:44,130
Masss, these guys look suspicious

1977
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:44,793
Then it's your call

1978
01:43:44,899 --> 01:43:45,949
Take out the voice recorder

1979
01:43:47,034 --> 01:43:48,817
Go outside and keep it
 under the coffee table

1980
01:43:48,853 --> 01:43:49,762
What should I do, sir?

1981
01:43:49,797 --> 01:43:50,918
Shut up and watch out for him

1982
01:43:51,408 --> 01:43:52,492
Masss, underneath the table...

1983
01:43:52,492 --> 01:43:53,822
...they've fixed a voice recorder

1984
01:43:54,348 --> 01:43:55,746
I told you to tell them you went

1985
01:43:55,815 --> 01:43:56,901
Why did you say otherwise?

1986
01:43:56,936 --> 01:43:58,686
Hey! I know what to talk and when

1987
01:43:59,107 --> 01:43:59,980
You shut up and go

1988
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:00,996
Girl, what's this?

1989
01:44:02,046 --> 01:44:03,969
I'm not a player in your game

1990
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,544
Nosey parker!

1991
01:44:05,965 --> 01:44:07,399
Sir, he's here

1992
01:44:11,254 --> 01:44:13,317
No cold water, is it fine?

1993
01:44:16,233 --> 01:44:17,248
I'll come back again

1994
01:44:17,283 --> 01:44:18,613
You should serve me cold water then

1995
01:44:18,682 --> 01:44:20,291
Ramya, give him the number

1996
01:44:20,291 --> 01:44:22,356
- Not your number, but mine
- Sorry, sir

1997
01:44:22,391 --> 01:44:23,336
Hope you'll remember

1998
01:44:24,317 --> 01:44:25,435
If you're leaving the country...

1999
01:44:25,435 --> 01:44:26,485
...inform me before you go

2000
01:44:26,485 --> 01:44:28,445
Why, do you own a travel company?

2001
01:44:30,125 --> 01:44:32,014
Want water?

2002
01:44:33,204 --> 01:44:34,848
They've placed a wireless
mike underneath

2003
01:44:35,898 --> 01:44:36,982
Outside

2004
01:44:37,052 --> 01:44:37,752
Where?

2005
01:45:03,781 --> 01:45:05,600
Vikram, Assistant Commissioner of Police...

2006
01:45:05,635 --> 01:45:07,070
...has come to meet you

2007
01:45:10,150 --> 01:45:11,795
Ask him to drive us to our quarry

2008
01:45:29,947 --> 01:45:31,242
Bro, please sit

2009
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:34,077
You look very familiar to me

2010
01:45:34,182 --> 01:45:35,337
Have we met before?

2011
01:45:35,652 --> 01:45:36,385
Not that I know of

2012
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:38,555
Old age is catching up
So 'Ghajini' memory!

2013
01:45:38,871 --> 01:45:41,039
No, we've certainly met somewhere

2014
01:45:41,075 --> 01:45:41,740
It's possible

2015
01:45:41,775 --> 01:45:43,210
We meet a lot of customers

2016
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:45,729
If you tell me who you are
and details about your work...

2017
01:45:45,763 --> 01:45:46,674
...I can jog my memory

2018
01:45:46,744 --> 01:45:48,003
See, I forgot to tell you that

2019
01:45:49,638 --> 01:45:50,863
My name is Madhivadhanan

2020
01:45:51,318 --> 01:45:52,682
Member of the Legislative assembly

2021
01:45:52,752 --> 01:45:53,416
I didn't know

2022
01:45:54,292 --> 01:45:55,377
Please sit

2023
01:45:56,007 --> 01:45:58,562
Looks like he doesn't watch television

2024
01:45:58,597 --> 01:45:59,576
Yeah, I don't

2025
01:45:59,611 --> 01:46:01,430
In the sub-collector murder case
in Kanchipuram...

2026
01:46:01,466 --> 01:46:03,531
...they suspected me
and put me behind bars

2027
01:46:03,985 --> 01:46:06,400
Masss, he seems like
 a big time murderer

2028
01:46:07,099 --> 01:46:09,408
Bro, I have total faith in God

2029
01:46:09,444 --> 01:46:11,718
If good exists then
 bad should also exist, right?

2030
01:46:11,788 --> 01:46:12,278
True

2031
01:46:12,313 --> 01:46:13,573
I also believe in ghosts

2032
01:46:16,638 --> 01:46:18,807
One of my friends
 died in an accident

2033
01:46:18,807 --> 01:46:19,507
Wretched fellow!

2034
01:46:19,542 --> 01:46:23,146
I don't know where he kept
his money and all the documents

2035
01:46:23,216 --> 01:46:24,651
That's why I'm in
a state of confusion

2036
01:46:24,686 --> 01:46:27,310
In my house for the past 2 days
something spooky is happening

2037
01:46:27,835 --> 01:46:29,900
Suddenly your number
 comes up on the mirror

2038
01:46:29,935 --> 01:46:33,434
I feel Antony 'anna' is trying to
say something through you

2039
01:46:33,469 --> 01:46:34,343
Just a minute

2040
01:46:36,198 --> 01:46:37,634
This is Antony 'anna'

2041
01:46:42,671 --> 01:46:44,807
Masss, you're dead meat

2042
01:46:45,227 --> 01:46:50,370
Call Antony's spirit and ask
where he's kept the cash and papers

2043
01:46:50,405 --> 01:46:52,050
You'll be truly blessed

2044
01:46:52,085 --> 01:46:53,309
You can do it, right?

2045
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,024
Masss, otherwise
you'll be done for!

2046
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,984
Give him some excuse
and escape from here

2047
01:46:57,054 --> 01:47:00,344
Good lord! Got trapped
in this chap's web

2048
01:47:00,729 --> 01:47:02,582
Why didn't you inform me
before coming here?

2049
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:03,562
Ask him to get out of here

2050
01:47:03,597 --> 01:47:04,647
Thinks he's my savior!

2051
01:47:04,682 --> 01:47:05,661
For all the problems-

2052
01:47:12,415 --> 01:47:13,430
What did I do?

2053
01:47:13,465 --> 01:47:15,670
Whose plan is it to go
house to house and write numbers?

2054
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:16,439
It's yours

2055
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:18,679
You took us to Sembikkarai
and made us kill Antony

2056
01:47:18,924 --> 01:47:20,743
Problem now is not
about going to Sembikarai

2057
01:47:20,779 --> 01:47:22,144
But the missing money in the locker!

2058
01:47:22,179 --> 01:47:23,263
The locker number-

2059
01:47:27,147 --> 01:47:28,302
How can that money disappear?

2060
01:47:28,407 --> 01:47:29,352
We didn't steal it

2061
01:47:30,053 --> 01:47:32,221
We didn't but someone else did

2062
01:47:32,431 --> 01:47:34,041
He suspects you

2063
01:47:34,145 --> 01:47:35,791
That's why he has called you here

2064
01:47:36,071 --> 01:47:37,086
He's talking to spirits

2065
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:38,730
Everyone is watching you

2066
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,305
It isn't easy for you
to leave this place

2067
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:42,124
If you listen to me,
I'll make you escape

2068
01:47:42,263 --> 01:47:44,924
Masss, if you listen to him
he'll end up like me!

2069
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:46,638
Without realizing
the gravity of the situation...

2070
01:47:46,638 --> 01:47:47,583
...you're playing the fool

2071
01:47:47,653 --> 01:47:48,247
I know

2072
01:47:49,227 --> 01:47:51,082
I know that-

2073
01:47:51,573 --> 01:47:52,936
I don't know

2074
01:47:53,496 --> 01:47:54,546
Did you find out?

2075
01:47:54,582 --> 01:47:56,226
What did the spirit of
Antony 'anna' tell you?

2076
01:47:56,261 --> 01:47:57,765
Didn't see Antony's spirit

2077
01:48:01,771 --> 01:48:03,030
Since he died in Sembikarari...

2078
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:04,569
...think the spirit is
 still roaming there

2079
01:48:04,569 --> 01:48:05,969
It's a spirit from out of town, right?

2080
01:48:05,969 --> 01:48:07,963
I couldn't bring it over here and talk

2081
01:48:07,998 --> 01:48:09,399
You're giving me a heart attack!

2082
01:48:09,714 --> 01:48:11,252
Shall we go to Sembikarai?

2083
01:48:11,288 --> 01:48:12,303
No...no

2084
01:48:12,652 --> 01:48:15,067
It won't work if we do that

2085
01:48:16,441 --> 01:48:18,086
I must perform a special prayer

2086
01:48:18,401 --> 01:48:19,521
It will take time

2087
01:48:19,835 --> 01:48:21,410
- It will take time?
- Yes, of course

2088
01:48:22,460 --> 01:48:23,860
RK 'anna' is on his way here

2089
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:28,894
You start the prayer-session immediately

2090
01:48:28,929 --> 01:48:31,065
After RK 'anna' comes,
we can all go to Sembikarai

2091
01:48:31,099 --> 01:48:32,394
It isn't as easy as you think

2092
01:48:32,394 --> 01:48:33,653
It needs preparation time

2093
01:48:33,688 --> 01:48:35,577
It will take at least a week

2094
01:48:35,892 --> 01:48:37,118
I will pray specially for this

2095
01:48:37,152 --> 01:48:38,133
I'll keep you posted

2096
01:48:38,168 --> 01:48:38,762
Drop me

2097
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,211
'Since he died in Sembikarari...'

2098
01:48:49,469 --> 01:48:51,184
'It's a spirit from out of town, right?'

2099
01:48:53,073 --> 01:48:53,984
Hey Mahesh?

2100
01:48:53,984 --> 01:48:54,754
Bro, you called?

2101
01:48:55,314 --> 01:48:57,272
Did anyone tell him
Antony 'anna' died in Sembikarai?

2102
01:48:57,342 --> 01:48:58,638
No, bro, I didn't tell him

2103
01:48:58,708 --> 01:48:59,933
Then how did he know?

2104
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:01,297
He was talking to someone, bro

2105
01:49:01,437 --> 01:49:02,943
He even knows about the locker

2106
01:49:03,012 --> 01:49:04,376
Maybe that's why he escaped

2107
01:49:04,376 --> 01:49:05,916
He must have spoken
 to Antony anna's spirit

2108
01:49:05,951 --> 01:49:06,791
He's hiding something

2109
01:49:06,826 --> 01:49:07,806
Go and get him

2110
01:49:09,052 --> 01:49:10,877
Enough of doing good to all of them

2111
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:11,713
Let's go to Bangkok

2112
01:49:11,751 --> 01:49:13,612
Many spirits there
are having a tough time

2113
01:49:13,651 --> 01:49:15,095
Come back
Boss wants to see you

2114
01:49:15,134 --> 01:49:15,666
Why?

2115
01:49:15,704 --> 01:49:16,958
I told you it will
take a week

2116
01:49:16,996 --> 01:49:19,048
He wants to discuss it
with you, come back

2117
01:49:19,124 --> 01:49:21,252
Aiyaiyo! It's getting late for me

2118
01:49:21,365 --> 01:49:22,887
Too many customers waiting

2119
01:49:23,001 --> 01:49:24,142
Tell him I'll come another day

2120
01:49:24,255 --> 01:49:25,585
Drop me if you don't mind

2121
01:49:28,777 --> 01:49:30,451
Hey! What's all this?

2122
01:49:31,286 --> 01:49:33,338
Why are you ganging up like this?

2123
01:49:33,376 --> 01:49:35,124
- Where's the money?
- Which money?

2124
01:49:35,163 --> 01:49:35,960
Don't act smart

2125
01:49:35,998 --> 01:49:37,595
Where is the money
I gave Antony 'anna'?

2126
01:49:37,633 --> 01:49:38,660
How will I know?

2127
01:49:38,774 --> 01:49:40,180
Mr Antony never turned up

2128
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:44,170
So he knows only the fact
Antony 'anna' died in Sembikarai, huh?

2129
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:47,515
Sir...that...it's not what you think

2130
01:49:48,351 --> 01:49:50,024
Masss, game over

2131
01:49:50,099 --> 01:49:53,483
They know all about you trying to
steal from the locker in Sembikarai

2132
01:49:53,558 --> 01:49:54,622
The question now is...

2133
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:55,914
...will they finish you?

2134
01:49:55,953 --> 01:49:57,473
Or will you close their chapter?

2135
01:49:58,196 --> 01:50:01,198
Hey! Don't think you can
fool me a 2nd time, okay?

2136
01:50:01,236 --> 01:50:02,413
Whom are you playing with?

2137
01:50:03,136 --> 01:50:05,074
Aren't you talking to Antony 'anna'?

2138
01:50:05,378 --> 01:50:07,202
If you don't tell us
where you've stashed it...

2139
01:50:07,202 --> 01:50:08,418
...I swear you're dead meat!

2140
01:50:08,457 --> 01:50:10,281
If you don't let me go
your life is in danger

2141
01:50:10,281 --> 01:50:12,143
You have the gall to
 threaten me in my area?

2142
01:50:12,143 --> 01:50:12,866
Sir, listen to me

2143
01:50:12,866 --> 01:50:14,119
I swear I don't know anything

2144
01:50:14,195 --> 01:50:15,411
How dare you deny it!

2145
01:50:19,745 --> 01:50:20,733
Okay, fine

2146
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:23,469
You don't seem to understand, sir

2147
01:50:23,469 --> 01:50:25,370
RK 'anna' is on his way
I'll pickle you to pieces

2148
01:50:25,408 --> 01:50:26,473
Why don't you liste-

2149
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:28,563
Because you're a big shot
I made allowance for you

2150
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,006
Go and make him sit
in cool comfort

2151
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:32,173
I'm warning you repeatedly
that your time isn't good

2152
01:50:35,137 --> 01:50:36,506
“Flying lean and mean in mid-air”

2153
01:50:38,443 --> 01:50:40,116
“Rays of gold gleam and glitter”

2154
01:50:41,751 --> 01:50:43,423
“Zip zap zooms to surpass”

2155
01:51:05,391 --> 01:51:06,607
Where is the money?

2156
01:51:06,645 --> 01:51:07,670
Don't create problems

2157
01:51:07,708 --> 01:51:09,039
Trying to con me?

2158
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,358
Are you dumb or what?

2159
01:51:11,777 --> 01:51:12,916
Won't you listen?

2160
01:51:35,303 --> 01:51:36,176
Let's run...quick

2161
01:51:36,176 --> 01:51:37,127
You got no brains?

2162
01:51:37,165 --> 01:51:38,381
How many times to tell you?

2163
01:51:38,493 --> 01:51:39,787
Where is the money?

2164
01:52:09,091 --> 01:52:10,116
Hey! What happened?

2165
01:52:12,245 --> 01:52:13,233
Lie on the floor

2166
01:52:14,943 --> 01:52:16,654
Masss, get some water

2167
01:52:19,922 --> 01:52:21,252
What the hell did you give?

2168
01:52:22,621 --> 01:52:23,913
Save me

2169
01:52:24,103 --> 01:52:25,394
Fire is spreading

2170
01:52:25,470 --> 01:52:26,306
Lie down

2171
01:52:27,182 --> 01:52:28,664
I'll stamp it out
Lie on the floor

2172
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:29,842
Masss, escape

2173
01:52:30,982 --> 01:52:32,691
The whole place will
burn now, you go

2174
01:52:32,767 --> 01:52:34,669
I am telling you to go

2175
01:52:34,669 --> 01:52:35,846
Fire is spreading

2176
01:52:35,923 --> 01:52:37,253
Masss!

2177
01:52:58,143 --> 01:52:59,778
Don't you remember?

2178
01:53:00,045 --> 01:53:01,223
Shakthi...!

2179
01:53:02,553 --> 01:53:03,502
Shakthi?

2180
01:53:03,693 --> 01:53:05,555
You thought it was all over?

2181
01:53:07,588 --> 01:53:09,375
Shakthi will come in any form

2182
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:11,312
No one can destroy me

2183
01:53:11,958 --> 01:53:14,428
I'll use him to kill all of you

2184
01:53:14,619 --> 01:53:15,949
Son of a mongrel!

2185
01:53:19,217 --> 01:53:20,661
Save me...!

2186
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,768
Masss, you haven't left?

2187
01:53:27,996 --> 01:53:29,783
You made me a fool
once more, no?

2188
01:53:29,859 --> 01:53:31,190
You'll use me to kill people?

2189
01:53:31,228 --> 01:53:32,369
What are you blabbering?

2190
01:53:32,407 --> 01:53:33,357
First, get out from here-

2191
01:53:33,395 --> 01:53:34,230
Why?

2192
01:53:35,028 --> 01:53:36,662
How many people
will you kill using me?

2193
01:53:37,194 --> 01:53:39,134
You're using me again
and again for your cause

2194
01:53:39,438 --> 01:53:40,692
Go away from here

2195
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:41,642
Be a little patient

2196
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:42,592
Ask him to go

2197
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:43,922
Why are you torturing him?

2198
01:53:43,959 --> 01:53:45,937
If you won't even let me speak-

2199
01:53:45,975 --> 01:53:47,001
How many more lies?

2200
01:53:47,115 --> 01:53:48,864
Did I spoil your flashback?

2201
01:53:49,015 --> 01:53:50,877
Looking at your face so often...

2202
01:53:50,915 --> 01:53:52,549
...I hate to look
at myself in the mirror

2203
01:53:53,462 --> 01:53:55,058
Go...just go away from my sight

2204
01:53:55,097 --> 01:53:56,008
You've got it all wron-

2205
01:53:56,046 --> 01:53:56,959
Didn't you hear me?

2206
01:53:57,224 --> 01:53:58,706
Masss, don't

2207
01:53:58,782 --> 01:53:59,885
I'll slit my throat myself

2208
01:53:59,922 --> 01:54:01,216
One more word and I die

2209
01:54:01,253 --> 01:54:02,660
Only if I am alive
you can use me

2210
01:54:02,698 --> 01:54:03,496
If I am dead?

2211
01:54:03,572 --> 01:54:04,599
Shall I slit my throat?

2212
01:54:04,636 --> 01:54:05,433
DON'T!

2213
01:54:05,509 --> 01:54:06,003
Then go

2214
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:07,029
GO

2215
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:07,866
I'll leave

2216
01:54:13,605 --> 01:54:14,669
Whole place is burning

2217
01:54:14,669 --> 01:54:16,570
Someone may come now
You leave immediately

2218
01:54:30,024 --> 01:54:31,697
How did you land here?

2219
01:54:40,933 --> 01:54:42,643
Grab him

2220
01:54:53,625 --> 01:54:54,957
Get into the car

2221
01:54:54,995 --> 01:54:56,021
Listen to me

2222
01:54:56,097 --> 01:54:57,047
Come

2223
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,454
Get in now

2224
01:55:14,948 --> 01:55:17,038
I'm in no way connected to them, sir

2225
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:19,053
It's all because of...

2226
01:55:19,357 --> 01:55:20,421
...Shakthi!

2227
01:55:21,828 --> 01:55:23,043
Shakthi?

2228
01:55:24,069 --> 01:55:26,009
He isn't Shakthi
His name is Masss

2229
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:29,277
I saw him in Sembikarai factory
on the day Antony 'anna' died

2230
01:55:29,353 --> 01:55:30,949
He killed Antony in Sembikarai

2231
01:55:31,025 --> 01:55:32,620
He killed the MLA also, sir

2232
01:55:32,887 --> 01:55:35,168
He was present there when
2 people known to you died

2233
01:55:35,207 --> 01:55:36,878
On top of it,
 the death penalty prisoner...

2234
01:55:36,916 --> 01:55:38,322
...Kamal Ekambaram was also there

2235
01:55:38,322 --> 01:55:39,994
What is the connection
between you two?

2236
01:55:40,032 --> 01:55:40,718
Stop it

2237
01:55:40,755 --> 01:55:41,895
Do you know who Shakthi is?

2238
01:55:41,933 --> 01:55:42,883
As if I care

2239
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,441
Why does he keep torturing me?

2240
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,961
He's your father

2241
01:55:46,379 --> 01:55:47,557
Your dad

2242
01:56:08,006 --> 01:56:11,769
'I was the only family friend
for your mother in India'

2243
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:13,403
'Your mother lived in Canada'

2244
01:56:13,593 --> 01:56:17,126
'Her dearest dream was to donate
 her land in India to an orphanage'

2245
01:56:17,241 --> 01:56:18,837
'I made all the arrangements'

2246
01:56:18,875 --> 01:56:21,878
'And I asked them to come
 to India to register the land'

2247
01:56:25,336 --> 01:56:28,302
'We went to the orphanage
as soon as they landed'

2248
01:56:28,302 --> 01:56:29,441
'When we reached-'

2249
01:56:34,426 --> 01:56:36,820
Madam, how could you
go back on your word?

2250
01:56:36,935 --> 01:56:40,088
'You came forward and offered to
give your land for our orphanage'

2251
01:56:40,165 --> 01:56:43,737
But now you've registered the land
to some construction company

2252
01:56:44,154 --> 01:56:45,904
Kamal 'anna', what is she saying?

2253
01:56:45,979 --> 01:56:48,222
'When we were in a dilemma
not knowing what to do...'

2254
01:56:48,335 --> 01:56:51,756
'...we came to know about RK
and Antony, 2 real estate sharks'

2255
01:56:51,908 --> 01:56:53,506
'If they set their eyes on a land...'

2256
01:56:53,544 --> 01:56:55,823
'...they would stoop
 to any level to grab it'

2257
01:56:55,823 --> 01:56:58,256
'But because your father was
a police officer with integrity...'

2258
01:56:58,293 --> 01:57:00,005
'...we went straight to
the registrar's office'

2259
01:57:00,043 --> 01:57:02,246
But Anuradha's death certificate
 has been submitted here

2260
01:57:02,284 --> 01:57:03,006
Whaaat?

2261
01:57:03,082 --> 01:57:04,793
You go straight to
 the Canadian embassy

2262
01:57:04,830 --> 01:57:08,290
Get an authenticated certificate
that you are Anuradha

2263
01:57:08,594 --> 01:57:10,835
'Before we could digest
such a deception...'

2264
01:57:11,026 --> 01:57:13,686
'...RK and Antony landed there'

2265
01:57:13,838 --> 01:57:15,702
Good afternoon
My name is Shakthi

2266
01:57:15,778 --> 01:57:18,057
I actually wanted to
meet you in person

2267
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:21,363
By mistake you seem to have placed
your company board on our land

2268
01:57:21,401 --> 01:57:22,961
Your accent is different

2269
01:57:23,188 --> 01:57:24,177
Are you from Ceylon?

2270
01:57:24,405 --> 01:57:25,582
Tamilian...!

2271
01:57:25,696 --> 01:57:26,874
They are my friends

2272
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:29,611
'While we were talking
things got out of hand'

2273
01:57:29,686 --> 01:57:32,385
Some goddamn foreign jackass
is claiming the land to be his!

2274
01:57:32,423 --> 01:57:34,552
After some time, will make up
stories saying they hit him

2275
01:57:34,628 --> 01:57:39,038
When the husband was away
they misbehaved with the wife etc

2276
01:57:39,455 --> 01:57:40,367
Shakthi!

2277
01:57:40,442 --> 01:57:41,545
How dare you!

2278
01:57:41,583 --> 01:57:42,685
Shakthi...no

2279
01:57:44,661 --> 01:57:47,285
If we come from abroad, you think
we'll sightsee, take snaps and...

2280
01:57:47,285 --> 01:57:49,374
...run back home,
scared of your vile threats?

2281
01:57:50,819 --> 01:57:51,997
Sacrificing his land...

2282
01:57:52,035 --> 01:57:54,164
...and without any identity of his own

2283
01:57:54,392 --> 01:57:56,254
...he lives in some corner of this world

2284
01:57:56,292 --> 01:57:57,697
Do you know his pain?

2285
01:57:57,697 --> 01:57:59,902
How long will he be a 'yes man'
to your wrong doings?

2286
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:01,082
A savior has to come

2287
01:58:01,955 --> 01:58:03,474
'Finally your father took the decision'

2288
01:58:03,513 --> 01:58:04,501
We'll register the land

2289
01:58:04,539 --> 01:58:07,199
'Because we needed
local police support also...'

2290
01:58:07,276 --> 01:58:09,329
'...we went and registered
a written complaint also'

2291
01:58:09,367 --> 01:58:11,000
Many have complained
against them, sir

2292
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,368
But no one has given it in writing

2293
01:58:12,406 --> 01:58:13,281
I'll handle it

2294
01:58:15,181 --> 01:58:17,918
'Next day we were waiting
 for the registrar's arrival'

2295
01:58:27,837 --> 01:58:30,459
Sir, they're here to
create some trouble

2296
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:31,981
I'm here, right?

2297
01:58:32,323 --> 01:58:33,501
I'll handle it

2298
01:58:36,161 --> 01:58:37,757
Let's not create any problems

2299
01:58:38,022 --> 01:58:39,583
We'll adjust in our present premises

2300
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:40,609
Inform sir

2301
01:58:41,254 --> 01:58:43,496
I've gathered everyone here
 just as you asked me to

2302
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:44,674
There's no written complaint

2303
01:58:44,712 --> 01:58:46,575
You do what is necessary

2304
01:58:59,573 --> 01:59:02,461
Aren't you the stowaway
who escaped in an illegal boat?

2305
01:59:03,298 --> 01:59:05,388
You think you'll save this land?

2306
01:59:05,426 --> 01:59:06,604
Did you notice something?

2307
01:59:06,642 --> 01:59:08,998
From the beginning hasn't this
land been torturing us?

2308
01:59:09,075 --> 01:59:09,796
Yes, you're right

2309
01:59:09,873 --> 01:59:11,508
Maybe a human sacrifice
will rectify it

2310
01:59:11,545 --> 01:59:12,913
Yes, Radha

2311
01:59:12,989 --> 01:59:15,384
Shall we start with that kid?

2312
01:59:25,417 --> 01:59:27,090
Madam, come away

2313
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:31,080
Go

2314
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:32,258
I can't-

2315
01:59:33,932 --> 01:59:34,958
Shakthi

2316
01:59:36,668 --> 01:59:37,465
Go away

2317
01:59:37,579 --> 01:59:38,263
Shakthi?

2318
01:59:38,301 --> 01:59:39,860
Both of you run from here

2319
01:59:50,541 --> 01:59:52,440
Hey! Catch hold of her

2320
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:54,264
Megha...wait

2321
01:59:55,709 --> 01:59:57,115
You go somewhere safe

2322
01:59:57,154 --> 01:59:58,104
Watch your step

2323
01:59:58,673 --> 01:59:59,471
Here you are

2324
02:00:00,156 --> 02:00:01,182
Hold your little brother

2325
02:00:01,333 --> 02:00:02,740
Hold on to him firmly

2326
02:00:02,778 --> 02:00:04,717
- You come, mom
- I will, you go

2327
02:00:04,755 --> 02:00:05,819
Be careful with the baby

2328
02:00:20,946 --> 02:00:21,706
Anu...!

2329
02:00:40,594 --> 02:00:42,458
Take care of my little brother

2330
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:55,645
Don't know whose baby this is

2331
02:00:55,911 --> 02:00:57,355
Someone has left him here

2332
02:00:57,393 --> 02:00:58,269
Is anyone there?

2333
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,676
Megha, come here

2334
02:01:02,715 --> 02:01:03,930
Hurry up

2335
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:08,057
Mom...?

2336
02:01:08,172 --> 02:01:09,045
Megha?

2337
02:01:16,874 --> 02:01:18,281
Meghaaaa

2338
02:01:33,103 --> 02:01:34,700
Don't do this...no

2339
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:36,524
Don't...please

2340
02:01:36,715 --> 02:01:37,817
Please

2341
02:01:38,502 --> 02:01:39,527
Let me go

2342
02:01:46,974 --> 02:01:49,217
Shakthi...!

2343
02:02:52,556 --> 02:02:53,849
What shall we do with him, bro?

2344
02:02:53,887 --> 02:02:56,204
He killed the entire family
wanting to usurp all the money

2345
02:02:56,243 --> 02:02:57,041
You caught him

2346
02:02:57,117 --> 02:02:58,181
We are your witnesses

2347
02:02:58,219 --> 02:02:59,625
Close the case

2348
02:03:40,749 --> 02:03:42,193
You could have told me, right?

2349
02:03:43,447 --> 02:03:45,044
That you are my dad

2350
02:03:45,195 --> 02:03:46,945
You could have told me

2351
02:03:47,667 --> 02:03:49,111
I intended to

2352
02:03:49,719 --> 02:03:52,758
But you said, if I talk
of relationship...

2353
02:03:52,835 --> 02:03:55,420
...you'll show your Hyde side

2354
02:03:57,321 --> 02:03:58,954
And asked me to
stand in a queue

2355
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:00,550
I didn't know-

2356
02:04:00,626 --> 02:04:02,414
Only when I mentioned
the word 'money'...

2357
02:04:02,755 --> 02:04:04,504
...you gave me a second look

2358
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:10,319
I didn't know-

2359
02:04:18,339 --> 02:04:20,125
Anu...Megha

2360
02:04:20,276 --> 02:04:21,834
Anu...?

2361
02:05:16,871 --> 02:05:18,620
Money blinded me

2362
02:05:18,620 --> 02:05:20,597
I didn't even know my dad
who was next to me

2363
02:05:20,635 --> 02:05:23,599
If only I had known
our family's plight right then-

2364
02:05:23,674 --> 02:05:25,309
I'd have massacred them

2365
02:05:26,411 --> 02:05:27,285
Who?

2366
02:05:27,437 --> 02:05:28,236
Tell me

2367
02:05:28,350 --> 02:05:29,376
Tell me, dad

2368
02:05:29,414 --> 02:05:31,276
Tell me now
How many should I kill?

2369
02:05:31,314 --> 02:05:32,150
Masss

2370
02:05:48,037 --> 02:05:49,405
Don't underestimate me

2371
02:05:49,975 --> 02:05:52,295
I knew when Kamal Ekambaram
escaped from prison

2372
02:05:52,371 --> 02:05:54,080
That someone is backing him up

2373
02:05:54,156 --> 02:05:56,132
He'd have given you graphic details...

2374
02:05:56,132 --> 02:05:58,184
...of  how I killed
your sister, mother and father

2375
02:05:58,184 --> 02:06:01,377
Your family was the foundation
for me to build my kingdom

2376
02:06:01,985 --> 02:06:04,418
I don't believe in leftovers
in any job I undertake

2377
02:06:04,493 --> 02:06:06,548
But only in your case
it somehow got missed

2378
02:06:06,699 --> 02:06:08,257
That damn kid duped me

2379
02:06:08,788 --> 02:06:10,917
Otherwise I'd have killed you
that very same day

2380
02:06:11,487 --> 02:06:14,871
Do you know how many families
 like yours are buried in my garden?

2381
02:06:15,516 --> 02:06:17,644
I vaguely remember your father's face

2382
02:06:17,682 --> 02:06:18,823
But I've forgotten  his name

2383
02:07:27,814 --> 02:07:29,656
I admitted all the boys
 in the hospital

2384
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:31,719
But...we looked everywhere

2385
02:07:31,792 --> 02:07:32,935
Couldn't find Masss alone

2386
02:07:32,971 --> 02:07:34,481
Take as many men as you want

2387
02:07:34,481 --> 02:07:35,843
I need Masss alive

2388
02:07:35,843 --> 02:07:37,685
He has important documents of mine

2389
02:07:39,454 --> 02:07:40,522
RK...?

2390
02:07:41,258 --> 02:07:42,068
You can go

2391
02:07:46,195 --> 02:07:47,042
Greetings, boss

2392
02:07:47,410 --> 02:07:48,882
What happened to Madhi?

2393
02:07:49,472 --> 02:07:50,577
Madhi-

2394
02:07:50,613 --> 02:07:53,340
...died in a fire accident in our quarry

2395
02:07:53,414 --> 02:07:54,813
When the rocks explode-

2396
02:07:55,108 --> 02:07:56,177
I know everything

2397
02:07:56,214 --> 02:07:58,460
Antony and Madhi who
knew about the container...

2398
02:07:58,496 --> 02:08:00,449
...have both died
when we were abroad

2399
02:08:00,485 --> 02:08:01,848
You hid that information from me

2400
02:08:02,106 --> 02:08:03,433
Election work has started

2401
02:08:03,691 --> 02:08:06,157
I must get that money
within the next 48 hours

2402
02:08:06,489 --> 02:08:07,336
If I don't get...

2403
02:08:07,373 --> 02:08:09,989
...the consequences are
 well known to all

2404
02:08:11,684 --> 02:08:13,634
Don稚 spoil our friendship
that has lasted so long

2405
02:08:21,402 --> 02:08:22,213
Please come

2406
02:08:26,006 --> 02:08:26,780
Dad?

2407
02:08:45,933 --> 02:08:46,781
- Dad...?
- Masss?

2408
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:48,475
Jet...?

2409
02:08:48,512 --> 02:08:49,580
Masss?

2410
02:08:49,764 --> 02:08:50,316
Jet...?

2411
02:08:50,353 --> 02:08:50,979
Lie down

2412
02:08:50,979 --> 02:08:52,636
- Masss, I'm here
- Don稚 strain

2413
02:08:53,373 --> 02:08:54,810
- Masss...?
- I can稚 see my dad

2414
02:08:54,847 --> 02:08:56,099
I知 right here, Masss

2415
02:08:56,136 --> 02:08:57,794
Where did you disappear, dad?

2416
02:08:57,831 --> 02:08:59,303
Malini, I知 not able to see them

2417
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:00,261
- Jet...?
- Masss

2418
02:09:00,298 --> 02:09:02,103
No one is here, Masss
Just me and Ekambaram

2419
02:09:02,176 --> 02:09:03,134
No, Malini

2420
02:09:03,209 --> 02:09:03,945
My dad, Jet-

2421
02:09:04,019 --> 02:09:05,197
Listen to me, Masss

2422
02:09:05,234 --> 02:09:06,450
Usually I can see them

2423
02:09:06,486 --> 02:09:08,327
Masss, don't strain

2424
02:09:08,364 --> 02:09:09,986
If you take rest
you'll be fine

2425
02:09:10,059 --> 02:09:11,127
Malini, make him lie down

2426
02:09:11,422 --> 02:09:12,858
Dad, where are you?

2427
02:09:12,895 --> 02:09:14,737
They are all here
but I知 unable to see them

2428
02:09:14,774 --> 02:09:15,695
Just give me a minute

2429
02:09:15,731 --> 02:09:17,573
Malini, I can't see my dad

2430
02:09:18,089 --> 02:09:18,899
Hey! Jet...?

2431
02:09:19,157 --> 02:09:20,594
Where did you go, dad?

2432
02:09:20,630 --> 02:09:22,435
I know they are all here
I can稚 see them, Malini

2433
02:09:22,472 --> 02:09:23,945
I want to talk to Jet

2434
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:24,939
I can't see them

2435
02:09:25,014 --> 02:09:25,824
Hey Sripathy

2436
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:26,561
Masss, I知 here

2437
02:09:26,561 --> 02:09:27,629
We are all here

2438
02:09:27,629 --> 02:09:28,881
Why am I not able to see them?

2439
02:09:28,955 --> 02:09:30,502
I want to see my dad
He needs me, sir

2440
02:09:30,539 --> 02:09:31,717
What happened to me, Malini?

2441
02:09:31,754 --> 02:09:33,227
How come suddenly I can't see them ?

2442
02:09:33,227 --> 02:09:34,148
Hey! Jet...?

2443
02:09:34,185 --> 02:09:35,143
How could you leave me?

2444
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:35,991
Malini, quick

2445
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:37,758
- Dad...?
- Relax, Masss

2446
02:09:37,868 --> 02:09:39,084
What has happened to Masss?

2447
02:09:39,121 --> 02:09:40,410
Sripathy...Azhagu

2448
02:09:40,447 --> 02:09:42,214
Hereafter, Masss can't...

2449
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:43,467
...see any of us

2450
02:09:43,652 --> 02:09:45,198
All of them will be
with me always, sir

2451
02:09:45,235 --> 02:09:46,525
What are you saying?

2452
02:09:48,476 --> 02:09:50,097
Power acquired from one accident

2453
02:09:53,448 --> 02:09:54,996
Got lost in another accident

2454
02:09:56,764 --> 02:09:57,979
Calm down, please

2455
02:09:58,496 --> 02:09:59,711
Can't see, Malini

2456
02:10:01,552 --> 02:10:02,620
Where is my dad?

2457
02:10:03,909 --> 02:10:05,052
He was with me

2458
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:16,886
Jet, I致e been fulfilling
everyone's last wishes

2459
02:10:16,886 --> 02:10:18,028
But I didn稚 ask you at all

2460
02:10:18,101 --> 02:10:19,501
What痴 your last desire?

2461
02:10:19,538 --> 02:10:21,417
I don稚 have anything
specific like that

2462
02:10:21,970 --> 02:10:23,516
I have no one but you

2463
02:10:23,552 --> 02:10:24,989
I want to always be with you

2464
02:10:24,989 --> 02:10:26,316
And torture you!

2465
02:10:26,426 --> 02:10:27,309
One tight slap

2466
02:10:27,642 --> 02:10:29,447
- You can't hit me!
- Tell me something

2467
02:10:29,484 --> 02:10:30,661
Such a madcap

2468
02:10:33,167 --> 02:10:34,124
Jet...?

2469
02:10:36,518 --> 02:10:37,624
You are here, right?

2470
02:10:37,882 --> 02:10:39,502
Aren't you right here?

2471
02:10:40,386 --> 02:10:42,043
Remember one day
you asked me?

2472
02:10:42,559 --> 02:10:44,327
'Is this how you talk
to your dead friend?'

2473
02:10:45,396 --> 02:10:47,384
It hurts me now, dude

2474
02:10:48,747 --> 02:10:50,551
DAI...dad...?

2475
02:10:50,957 --> 02:10:52,210
Where are you?

2476
02:10:52,283 --> 02:10:53,829
After I knew you are my dad...

2477
02:10:53,867 --> 02:10:55,414
... I知 not able to see you!

2478
02:11:02,764 --> 02:11:04,017
Masss?

2479
02:11:08,474 --> 02:11:09,433
Nothing...I'm fine

2480
02:11:10,242 --> 02:11:12,710
Listen, Masss
750 million is right here

2481
02:11:12,746 --> 02:11:13,926
You and Malini take it

2482
02:11:13,963 --> 02:11:14,994
And live happily together

2483
02:11:15,178 --> 02:11:16,615
I致e told her the whole story

2484
02:11:16,652 --> 02:11:18,971
Your dad also will want
 to see you happy

2485
02:11:20,555 --> 02:11:22,213
No, he won't like it, sir

2486
02:11:23,245 --> 02:11:25,749
Dad, you won't like it, right?

2487
02:11:29,517 --> 02:11:30,990
I must kill RK, dad

2488
02:11:32,943 --> 02:11:34,822
I must kill him
with my own hands, right?

2489
02:11:35,006 --> 02:11:36,257
Did you see that?

2490
02:11:36,331 --> 02:11:37,879
I must do the honors!

2491
02:11:37,916 --> 02:11:38,873
My dad wants me to

2492
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:39,941
No, Masss

2493
02:11:40,015 --> 02:11:41,783
Antony, Madhi, RK
and the commissioner

2494
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:43,513
I escaped from jail
only to kill them

2495
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:44,987
That's why I killed the commissioner

2496
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:45,687
2 out of the 3-

2497
02:11:45,687 --> 02:11:48,008
I killed them not knowing
who they were, sir

2498
02:11:49,223 --> 02:11:52,022
I even fought with my dad
because of that, sir

2499
02:11:52,317 --> 02:11:53,201
I yelled at him

2500
02:11:53,717 --> 02:11:55,042
Till my throat went hoarse, sir

2501
02:11:57,880 --> 02:11:59,647
Now I should kill him knowingly

2502
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:02,114
Only I should kill him

2503
02:12:02,999 --> 02:12:04,879
'I somehow missed your case alone'

2504
02:12:05,099 --> 02:12:06,719
'That brat of a kid duped me'

2505
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:09,297
'Otherwise I'd have killed you
that very same day'

2506
02:12:09,408 --> 02:12:10,365
'Just like your family...'

2507
02:12:10,403 --> 02:12:12,612
'...do you know how many
 are buried in my garden?'

2508
02:12:12,870 --> 02:12:15,375
'I vaguely remember your father's face'

2509
02:12:15,485 --> 02:12:16,702
'But I don't know his name'

2510
02:12:16,737 --> 02:12:18,433
'You don稚 know
your father痴 name, right?'

2511
02:12:23,247 --> 02:12:24,647
Looks like if we dig your garden...

2512
02:12:24,684 --> 02:12:27,004
...we can find cases
full of unsolved cases

2513
02:12:27,041 --> 02:12:28,182
If I should ignore all this...

2514
02:12:28,218 --> 02:12:30,392
...you'll be wasting time
 reporting to the Commissioner

2515
02:12:30,504 --> 02:12:32,160
Let me know how much
commission I値l get

2516
02:12:32,197 --> 02:12:33,266
I値l give you 200 million

2517
02:12:33,303 --> 02:12:34,261
I want Masss

2518
02:12:34,298 --> 02:12:35,733
I want all my documents from him

2519
02:12:35,770 --> 02:12:37,318
Need the original
 of this recording

2520
02:12:38,127 --> 02:12:39,638
I致e already planned it to the T

2521
02:12:39,896 --> 02:12:41,518
How to chop Masss into pieces

2522
02:12:41,554 --> 02:12:43,505
And produce him before you

2523
02:12:48,625 --> 02:12:49,841
Hey!
Grab him

2524
02:12:58,864 --> 02:13:01,995
No one should call me
a cop who didn稚 grab, right?

2525
02:13:02,033 --> 02:13:03,026
That's why

2526
02:13:03,101 --> 02:13:05,752
Take this as bribe
and board him into the jeep

2527
02:13:06,452 --> 02:13:08,626
I arrested Ekambaram, RK

2528
02:13:08,700 --> 02:13:09,657
Masss isn稚 here

2529
02:13:10,062 --> 02:13:11,020
Got all the documents

2530
02:13:11,204 --> 02:13:12,235
Where is the container?

2531
02:13:12,310 --> 02:13:13,414
Krishnapattinam port

2532
02:13:13,451 --> 02:13:14,629
Andhra Pradesh

2533
02:13:14,666 --> 02:13:16,471
To have Ekambaram alive
and in our custody...

2534
02:13:16,546 --> 02:13:18,791
...till we get the money in
 our hands is the safest measure

2535
02:13:25,764 --> 02:13:27,348
I致e briefed all the details to Naresh

2536
02:13:39,187 --> 02:13:40,440
Open it

2537
02:14:10,474 --> 02:14:12,242
Those who want to be alive...

2538
02:14:12,317 --> 02:14:13,827
...run away from here
this very minute

2539
02:14:13,864 --> 02:14:15,299
Being all alone
you're threatening me?

2540
02:14:15,299 --> 02:14:16,147
Where is the money?

2541
02:14:16,183 --> 02:14:17,510
Who the hell told you...

2542
02:14:17,547 --> 02:14:18,689
...I'm single?

2543
02:14:24,435 --> 02:14:25,834
Hey! Let's take him

2544
02:14:27,272 --> 02:14:29,002
Are you showing me
your magic tricks?

2545
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,475
Where have you kept the money?

2546
02:14:40,146 --> 02:14:41,842
Hey! Don稚 shoot him

2547
02:14:41,879 --> 02:14:42,725
Where's the money?

2548
02:14:42,763 --> 02:14:44,788
If you don稚 answer
 your head will shatter to pieces

2549
02:14:58,822 --> 02:15:00,921
You can now shoot him
make Masss-soup and enjoy

2550
02:15:03,352 --> 02:15:04,642
There痴 750 million here

2551
02:15:04,677 --> 02:15:05,562
Deal is okay now

2552
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:06,925
Where should I bring RK?

2553
02:15:06,962 --> 02:15:08,251
If RK should trust you...

2554
02:15:08,692 --> 02:15:10,976
...first arrest Ekambaram
in the place I tell you

2555
02:15:15,582 --> 02:15:17,791
I値l give you much more
than what he gave you

2556
02:15:17,827 --> 02:15:18,748
Sorry, RK

2557
02:15:18,786 --> 02:15:19,817
Instead of the best deal...

2558
02:15:19,854 --> 02:15:21,659
...first come first served is my preference

2559
02:15:21,659 --> 02:15:23,390
Pretended to be a good cop
and tricked me

2560
02:15:23,464 --> 02:15:24,457
Who told you I'm good?

2561
02:15:55,977 --> 02:15:57,892
Blackie, crush him

2562
02:16:01,871 --> 02:16:03,785
Why are you lifting that door?

2563
02:16:04,007 --> 02:16:06,585
Hey! That man can see us!

2564
02:16:09,826 --> 02:16:11,889
Watch out, he will kill you
with his nonstop chatter

2565
02:16:11,925 --> 02:16:13,399
We need you to lend us
your right hand

2566
02:16:13,437 --> 02:16:15,093
Who is dead here
for us to do funeral rites?

2567
02:16:15,093 --> 02:16:16,382
We are dead and roaming around

2568
02:16:16,419 --> 02:16:17,783
Then why is it you're so pathetic-

2569
02:16:17,893 --> 02:16:19,403
Why are you hitting me from behind?

2570
02:16:22,350 --> 02:16:24,634
Strange...I hit him and
 these chaps disappeared?

2571
02:16:24,855 --> 02:16:25,739
Where have you gone?

2572
02:16:25,811 --> 02:16:26,659
Where痴 our hero?

2573
02:16:26,696 --> 02:16:28,096
He痴 fighting
a solo battle

2574
02:16:28,132 --> 02:16:29,532
Let me contribute
my 2 penny bit

2575
02:16:29,532 --> 02:16:30,601
Poor thing!

2576
02:16:30,712 --> 02:16:32,738
He痴 forgotten he is a hero too

2577
02:16:47,472 --> 02:16:48,428
Who is this?

2578
02:16:48,465 --> 02:16:50,195
Hey! Who is making
the 'Premgi mudra'?

2579
02:17:05,003 --> 02:17:06,734
How atrocious is this?!

2580
02:17:33,955 --> 02:17:35,096
Disgusting!

2581
02:17:35,649 --> 02:17:36,717
Who the hell are you?

2582
02:17:36,754 --> 02:17:37,859
Dirtied my hands so much

2583
02:17:37,896 --> 02:17:39,001
Won't I do this for you?

2584
02:18:02,322 --> 02:18:04,532
Dad, are you watching?

2585
02:18:06,741 --> 02:18:08,730
Dad, you池e watching, right?

2586
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:09,725
Watch me now

2587
02:18:13,887 --> 02:18:15,324
You're watching, right?

2588
02:18:20,850 --> 02:18:22,359
You wanted to know
my father痴 name?

2589
02:18:22,396 --> 02:18:23,796
My dad is Shakthi

2590
02:18:33,815 --> 02:18:35,068
Didn't I tell you?

2591
02:18:35,141 --> 02:18:36,981
I'll kill him with my hands

2592
02:18:37,093 --> 02:18:38,419
You just relax and watch

2593
02:18:39,339 --> 02:18:40,739
Come here

2594
02:19:37,648 --> 02:19:38,493

"Get set at Jet speed en Massse"

2596
02:20:23,890 --> 02:20:25,326
"Sky rocket to Jet out and aMasss"

2597
02:20:30,152 --> 02:20:33,023
"In tip top style to cover
Hither and thither world over"

2598
02:20:33,171 --> 02:20:36,081
"Zip zap zooms to surpass
Earns 100% applause"

2599
02:20:36,081 --> 02:20:39,433
"Seas and shores he encompasses
This Masss is for the masses"

2600
02:20:39,839 --> 02:20:42,638
"Here...hereafter, wait and watch
In fact he has the Midas touch"

2601
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:49,562
Hello, sir

2602
02:20:53,119 --> 02:20:54,592
