1
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:51,100
Om!

2
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:20,495
Every year we go to Kashmir..

3
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:25,160
..but since last year my daughter
has been insisting on going to Shimla.

4
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:28,200
Are you going to
Shimla for the first time?

5
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,960
No, no, I have lived in
Shimla for many years.

6
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:33,080
We left Shimla and
came to Mumbai..

7
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,240
..when she was 2 months old.
- Okay.

8
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,680
After that we are going now.
Because of her. - Okay.

9
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,720
Because she hasn't seen Shimla.

10
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,960
Look! One more tunnel!
Mama, how many more are there?

11
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,800
Must be a couple 
of them more, right? - Yes.

12
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,703
Chandramukhi,
look, there is Shimla.

13
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,914
I have already
been to this place.

14
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:14,834
What nonsense are you talking?

15
00:02:54,394 --> 00:03:04,154
"Destiny only creates the
cycle of joys and sorrows."

16
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:14,434
"Destiny only creates the
cycle of joys and sorrows."

17
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:24,754
"It is manifested in
the lines on the palms."

18
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:35,021
"Destiny only creates the
cycle of joys and sorrows."

19
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:17,059
"Sometimes it becomes
memories in adverse situations."

20
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:26,619
"Sometimes it becomes the
bright future in the springtime."

21
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:36,619
"There is darkness in one
hand and a lamp in the other."

22
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:46,659
"Destiny only creates the
cycle of joys and sorrows."

23
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:53,957
Papa, I got ready before mama.

24
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:57,357
Hey! Mama, come!

25
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,837
Today your mummy will
come out all dressed up. - Yes.

26
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,757
Look! Didn't I tell you? - Wow!

27
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,957
Mama is looking very beautiful!
- Let us go. - Come.

28
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,473
Dear, today we will go 
to Mall Road. - Okay.

29
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:10,397
I met your mummy for the
first time on Mall Road. - Oh!

30
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,237
And I was charmed
by her graceful walk.

31
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:14,003
Oh, shut up!

32
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:27,237
Oh, Sarla! - Oh, Kanta!

33
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:31,997
You are here! - I come here 
every year. And you?

34
00:05:32,077 --> 00:05:34,437
I don't know after how
many years I have come here.

35
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:35,710
This is my husband.

36
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,667
And this is my old 
friend, Kanta. - Hello.

37
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,757
And this is my daughter 
Chandramukhi. - Hello.

38
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:41,246
Is she the same girl
who was born here?

39
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:44,630
Yes, we had left Shimla
when she was 2 months old.

40
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,117
She is so beautiful!
Bless you, my child!

41
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:48,867
Kanta, you had
a son, didn't you?

42
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,237
Yes, Naresh. He has just 
returned from America..

43
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,818
..after studying medicine.
- Really?

44
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,277
Why not get them to 
meet each other? - Sure.

45
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:54,957
More than half of the
weddings in Punjab..

46
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:56,240
..are fixed on Mall Road.

47
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:59,948
Sarla, where are you staying?

48
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,477
At Sunny Cottage.

49
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:04,261
Well, that cottage is near us.
- Really?

50
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,957
Yes, we are staying
at Akash Niwas.

51
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:07,557
Oh. - There is one thing.

52
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:08,910
Tomorrow you will
have tea with us.

53
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,317
Certainly. We will go, okay?

54
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,957
Sarla, come.
How are you? - I am fine.

55
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:22,677
How are you? - I am also fine.

56
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,837
Hello, brother, how are you?
- I am fine.

57
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,837
About you?
How are you? - I am fine.

58
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:33,357
Naresh, come here.
- I am coming, mother.

59
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:55,877
This is my son, Naresh.

60
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,757
Hello. - Bless you!

61
00:06:57,837 --> 00:06:58,917
How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

62
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:00,117
Let us go inside.

63
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:02,317
Come.

64
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:11,757
Mama was right. One feels like 
keep on staring at you.

65
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:16,317
What are you looking at?

66
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,090
The bungalow.

67
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:21,837
Yes, it is very old.

68
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:23,517
Come, let us go inside.

69
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:27,317
Thank you.

70
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,597
Why did you name this
house as Akash Niwas?

71
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,117
Akash Niwas should
be at some higher spot.

72
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,877
The name of this house
was not Akash Niwas.

73
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,877
The name of this house
was 'Dimple Cottage.'

74
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:44,237
An Englishman 
used to live here.

75
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,277
A military officer.

76
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:48,317
Mr. Tom.

77
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,117
His name was Mr. Tom.

78
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:53,757
Painting was his hobby.

79
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:58,237
The garden outside this house
used to be full of red flowers.

80
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,317
And there was a
lone deodar tree.

81
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,717
There used to be 
a rickshaw too.

82
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:06,317
Tom Walters.

83
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:09,957
Dimple Cottage.

84
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:12,677
Have you come to this
house for the first time?

85
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:14,357
She has come to Shimla 
for the first time.

86
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,237
We had left Shimla
and gone to Mumbai..

87
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,477
..when she was
just two months old.

88
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,317
Then..

89
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,237
Chandramukhi!

90
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,037
By the way, the
house is beautiful.

91
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:35,096
Kanta, have you bought it?
- No, it is rented.

92
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,677
It belongs to
Chaudhary Janak Singh.

93
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:38,997
He is a very 
rich man of Shimla.

94
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:41,677
He is as kind as he is rich.

95
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:44,037
His wife has passed away.
He has a daughter.

96
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:46,117
He loves her very much. - Oh.

97
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:49,757
I don't know why all of a
sudden I am feeling sad.

98
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,317
Papa, are you 
feeling all right?

99
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,317
It's not a physical matter.

100
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:58,117
My mind just feels restlessness
and then it passes away.

101
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:00,597
The feeling comes
and then passes away.

102
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,103
Hello, Mr. Chaudhary.

103
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,037
Is the work in the jungle
going on all right? - Yes.

104
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:14,237
Don't chop more wood 
than permitted. - No.

105
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,037
Okay..

106
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,877
Tomorrow morning, we will go 
early for horse riding.

107
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:24,757
Okay, sir.

108
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:26,406
Sir.

109
00:09:26,486 --> 00:09:28,237
Have the tea served.
- Okay, sir.

110
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:37,517
Papa, I will just be back.

111
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:04,877
I wish I was as
beautiful as my mother.

112
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,437
Had your mother been alive..

113
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:09,957
..she would have
talked to you about this.

114
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,357
About what, papa?

115
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,957
Dear, there is no guarantee 
of life. Instead of..

116
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:17,117
Papa, why have you
started to talk like this?

117
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,357
Who can change
the law of nature?

118
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:24,117
It is my desire that
your wedding gets fixed..

119
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:26,237
..while I am still alive.

120
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,476
That means you have got me
educated to become a lawyer..

121
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:30,237
..so that I should
leave my profession..

122
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:32,477
..and get married to someone!

123
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:34,557
What if you get
married to a lawyer?

124
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:40,117
I mean Mohan.
- Papa, he is very famous.

125
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:42,677
I am an ordinary lawyer.

126
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,317
How can I dream
of winning his heart?

127
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,757
My daughter is a precious gem.

128
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:49,597
The man who marries
her will be very lucky.

129
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:53,317
Do you like Mohan?

130
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:58,917
And there is no one
better than Mohan, right?

131
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:00,997
There is no one
better than papa.

132
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,037
Mohan..

133
00:11:08,124 --> 00:11:09,117
..will be coming here.

134
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:10,677
Papa, why didn't
you tell me before?

135
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:15,778
Then how could I see
the gleam in your eyes?

136
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:22,477
Listen!

137
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:27,357
Listen, mister!

138
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,490
Did you say something?

139
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,530
I have been trying to say..

140
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,010
I have been trying
to say something..

141
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,770
..but you don't listen.

142
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:40,410
You keep reading book.

143
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,410
I say.. did you recognize me?

144
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,290
I said did you.. recognize me?

145
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:51,290
Pardon me, I didn't
recognize you.

146
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,930
I am Sita. I am Sita.

147
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,850
The heroine of Ramayan.

148
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,010
The wife of Shri Ramchandra.

149
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:10,690
Mister, did you study at
Amritsar Khalsa College?

150
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,650
Yes.

151
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:19,650
So, is your name Mohan Kapoor?

152
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:22,890
Yes, it is. - Now, tell my name.

153
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,610
Pyare! - Pyare!

154
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,050
Hey, Pyare!

155
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:33,410
You know, you used to play Sita's
role in 'Ramleela' (folk theatre)..

156
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,753
..and everybody
used to tease you!

157
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:38,290
You were very beautiful.
- Stop it.

158
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,930
My friend, you didn't
recognize your Sita.

159
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,170
Your moustache blocked the way.
- Yes, friend.

160
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,450
Tell me what are
you doing these days?

161
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,930
These days I am the
manager of Gaiety theatre.

162
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,130
Gaiety theatre? - Yes.

163
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:58,235
Why did you leave the school?

164
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:01,210
My father died.

165
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,490
One of his friends took up the
responsibility of my education.

166
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:04,890
So, I had to go to Delhi.

167
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:09,290
It's getting cold.
- Have a drink.

168
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:11,050
You carry on.

169
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,530
Thank you, 
I saved on my liquor.

170
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,690
Thank you.

171
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:18,130
Well, what are you
doing these days?

172
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,410
I am a lawyer at Chandigarh.

173
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:23,290
Are you a lawyer 
at Chandigarh?

174
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,629
So, are you going to Shimla
for the first time? - Yes.

175
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:31,050
Listen, you will stay
with me in Shimla.

176
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,410
Thank you, my
friend, but I'm staying..

177
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:34,690
..at Chaudhary
Janak Singh's house.

178
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,130
Oh, my God! Chaudhary Janak 
Singh is a very big man.

179
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,850
I cannot compete with him.

180
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,307
He only got me the job.

181
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:44,490
He only took up the
responsibility of my education.

182
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,650
Really?

183
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:48,410
Whatever I am today
is because of him.

184
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,570
Very true, that's very true.

185
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:22,732
There.. Look! There he is!

186
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,290
Come on, hurry up!

187
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,410
Come, give me a hug.

188
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,450
Hello, Mr. Chaudhary.
- Bless you. Karuna.

189
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:30,650
Hello. - Hello.

190
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,930
Karuna also came 
to receive you.

191
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:34,090
Mr. Chaudhary, why did you 
take the trouble to come?

192
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,410
You have come to
Shimla for the first time..

193
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,372
..so why can't I?
- Hello, Mr. Chaudhary.

194
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:40,171
Hello, hello.

195
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,896
Pyarelal. - Pyarelal.

196
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,216
Did you finish your work?

197
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:48,096
Sir, you had helped me,
how could it not be finished?

198
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:50,246
Good day.
Sir, I remembered one thing.

199
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:53,095
The night after tomorrow,
there is a programme..

200
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:56,008
..of singer Saraswati
Devi at Gaiety Theatre.

201
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:57,510
Gaiety Theatre?
- At half past nine.

202
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,046
Yes, Gaiety.
You all should come.

203
00:14:59,126 --> 00:14:59,814
Yes, Mohan will also come.

204
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:01,976
Promise? - Promise.

205
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,560
Karuna is also a lawyer.
She does practice at the high court.

206
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,016
Really? If ever I have to
fight a case against her..

207
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,976
..I am sure I will lose.

208
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:14,896
Thanks for the praise.

209
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:29,372
Karuna! - Yes?

210
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:31,216
Accommodate Mohan
in the guest house.

211
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,616
He will be more 
comfortable there. - Come.

212
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:41,112
Look, you can see 
the whole of Shimla. - Yes.

213
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,016
Mall Road..
- A very beautiful place.

214
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,216
This is the guest house.
- Lovely.

215
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:51,536
Mohan, I forgot to
tell you of good news.

216
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:54,216
You have been appointed as
the public prosecutor at Shimla.

217
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:58,896
What? - Papa!
Congratulations. - Thanks.

218
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,976
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

219
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:09,456
I am grateful to you that you
considered me suitable for this.

220
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,536
Welcome, my boy, welcome.

221
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:17,976
Yes, I treat only mental
problems or dysfunctional brains.

222
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,376
I mean I am a psychiatrist.

223
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:23,696
That means you are of no use
if there is a headache or a boil.

224
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:25,903
No, there are many
doctors to treat that.

225
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,296
Have you studied
medicine in America?

226
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:30,696
Yes. And I am getting 
a good job over there.

227
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:32,616
I am thinking of going
there after marriage.

228
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,491
Why don't you marry
a girl from that place?

229
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:39,091
You can fall in love with an
American girl, but can't marry her.

230
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,521
And you can marry an Indian girl 
but can't fall in love with her.

231
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,091
I laugh a lot, is there
no remedy for that?

232
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:03,331
Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi!

233
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:05,411
What happened?

234
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:10,331
What happened?
- I am not feeling well.

235
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,891
Shall we go back? - Yes.

236
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,171
Come.

237
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:20,251
"You are the
messenger of Lord Ram."

238
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,091
This is our ancestral temple
and my ancestors have been..

239
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:23,731
..venerating at this temple.

240
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:27,091
This priest and his ancestors
have been priests of this temple.

241
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,091
We have a relation since 
many generations. Right, priest?

242
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,251
Yes, sir.

243
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:34,491
Shimla looks very
beautiful from here.

244
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:38,651
"You take the side
of the righteous."

245
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:41,251
Priest, how do Mohan and
Karuna look as a couple?

246
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:44,609
Very beautiful, sir. - So, fix an
auspicious time for engagement..

247
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:47,398
..and do check and
match their horoscopes.

248
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:48,954
As you wish.
- About the predictions.

249
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,251
Okay.

250
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:58,091
Mohan, I own many of
these buildings and orchards.

251
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:03,091
I have no other children.
Karuna likes you.

252
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,891
If you agree to this proposal,
I will be grateful to you.

253
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:09,091
I will become free of
a great responsibility.

254
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:14,251
You have already
done many favors to me.

255
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,091
There is no
hurry, think over it.

256
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:18,571
Papa, shall we go? - Come.

257
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:31,331
I did not feel like returning to
India when I was in America.

258
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,491
Oh.

259
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,571
Now that I am here, I don't
feel like going back to America.

260
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,571
You get stuck on
whichever place you go to.

261
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:47,091
You should get 
yourself treated.

262
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:50,179
My treatment is in your hands.

263
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,091
In my hands? - Yes.

264
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:58,891
It is said that half-baked
knowledge is dangerous.

265
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:03,731
Madam, now the
dangerous is more fun.

266
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:08,891
Mother was going to talk 
to your daddy. - Okay.

267
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:10,331
About you and me. - Okay.

268
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,471
I told her that first I should 
ask you. What do you say?

269
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,091
So, what do you say?

270
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,091
You didn't answer me.

271
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,839
It's strange. - What?

272
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:09,855
It feels as if this view
is capturing my heart.

273
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:12,775
The evenings are
usually like this.

274
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,855
Mr. Chaudhary has been
very generous towards me.

275
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:22,535
I consider myself
to be very lucky.

276
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:24,695
He always keeps praising you.

277
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:30,535
And you? - I feel happy 
on hearing about you.

278
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:35,615
Mr. Chaudhary has mentioned
something, about you and me.

279
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,255
Won't you ask me
what I have decided?

280
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:42,535
If you ask, then the
question loses its charm.

281
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:45,335
I will enjoy telling
you about it.

282
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:49,535
Karuna! Mohan!
Aren't you ready yet?

283
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:52,849
Weren't you supposed to go
to some program this evening?

284
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:56,535
Papa, won't you come along?

285
00:20:56,615 --> 00:21:00,335
Dear, these evenings are
enjoyable in young age.

286
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:02,535
Now it's the 
evening of my life.

287
00:21:02,773 --> 00:21:04,335
I am going 
to meet the governor.

288
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:06,535
These are the days
for you two to have fun.

289
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:09,255
Listen to songs, 
go to the theatre. Okay?

290
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:30,691
Chandramukhi.

291
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:41,491
Mohan, come here. Come.

292
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:46,011
Where are you taking us? 
- Come.

293
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:53,140
Madam Saraswati, he is my
childhood friend, Mohan Kapoor.

294
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:57,411
In school, he used to do Ram's
role, and I used to do Sita's role.

295
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,411
Shall we go? The program 
is about to start. - Okay.

296
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:19,331
Today's program
will be different.

297
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:26,808
Suddenly I feel
like singing a song..

298
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:31,331
..which I haven't
sung since 30 years.

299
00:22:49,091 --> 00:23:02,691
"I don't know how
much I love you."

300
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:09,411
"But I can't live without you."

301
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:14,251
"How much I love you.."

302
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:24,691
"I don't know how..

303
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:32,251
..much I love you."

304
00:23:32,331 --> 00:23:40,691
"But I can't live without you."

305
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:49,491
"I don't know how
much I love you."

306
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:59,091
"But I can't live without you."

307
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:28,126
"I have always
been crazy for you."

308
00:24:36,677 --> 00:24:44,691
"I have always
been crazy for you."

309
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:53,491
"O darling, you have
forgotten long time love."

310
00:24:53,813 --> 00:25:01,931
"You did not appreciate
it, you didn't appreciate it."

311
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:09,691
"I don't know how
much I love you."

312
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:17,931
"But I can't live without you."

313
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:21,909
"I love you."

314
00:25:53,963 --> 00:26:02,233
"If anybody glances at you.."

315
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:18,568
"If anybody glances at you.."

316
00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:27,033
"..I can't bear it, my love."

317
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:35,357
"I feel jealous,
I feel jealous."

318
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:42,784
"I don't know how
much I love you."

319
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:50,579
"But I can't live without you."

320
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:58,406
"I don't know how
much I love you."

321
00:26:58,611 --> 00:27:07,976
"But I can't live without you."

322
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:21,206
What happened? - He will die!

323
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:24,123
Chandramukhi! - He will die!
- Dear, what happened?

324
00:28:25,346 --> 00:28:26,683
Dear, calm down.

325
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:28,123
It's okay.

326
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,363
She must have had a dream.
She got scared.

327
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:32,904
It's okay, dear.

328
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:35,585
Mohan! It's a 
beautiful morning today.

329
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:36,984
Lovely morning, sir.

330
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:38,984
Karuna! - Yes?

331
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,617
Take him around Shimla.
Show him our orchards.

332
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,984
And also take him for
horse riding with you.

333
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:47,144
Okay.

334
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:50,304
Hi, Mohan! - Oh, Pyare.

335
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,304
Hello, Mr. Chaudhary. - Hello.

336
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:53,704
Come, come. - Please come.

337
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:57,864
Pyare, you look very happy.

338
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:01,786
Who wouldn't feel happy on
seeing the two of you together?

339
00:29:01,946 --> 00:29:03,146
Why so early in the morning?

340
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:06,286
Are you a lawyer 
or a magician?

341
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:10,704
You have cast such a
spell on Madam Saraswati..

342
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,353
..that she told me in the morning
to immediately bring you to her.

343
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:17,386
So we have to go to madame
Saraswati's house. Come.

344
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,866
I too will come to meet her.
- Sure, come.

345
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:21,226
Both of you will go together
wherever you have to go.

346
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:23,546
From today, I am the
tourist guide of Shimla.

347
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:25,146
I am your PRO.

348
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:26,946
Now I have got 2 guides.
Shall we go?

349
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,146
Come.

350
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:34,146
Oh. Oh, my knee!

351
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:38,306
Pyare, you were taking us
to madam Saraswati's house.

352
00:29:38,386 --> 00:29:40,396
Yes. - Does she 
live in this jungle?

353
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:44,466
My friend, wait for a minute.
I am feeling breathless.

354
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,146
Let me perk up my mind. 
- Do it.

355
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:53,706
Look. Look over there.
- There are trees all around.

356
00:29:53,786 --> 00:29:57,866
Do you see that thick
tree among all the trees?

357
00:29:58,158 --> 00:30:02,786
Can you see it? It is called 
Pa Ma tree. - Really?

358
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:04,146
Pa Ma? 
- You didn't understand?

359
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:06,626
You didn't understand.
Come, I'll explain. Come.

360
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:11,466
Can you read it?
Come closer. Look.

361
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:13,786
But what's so 
special about it?

362
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,823
My friend, I have brought
you here for your benefit only.

363
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,306
What did you say?
- It's a very old tree.

364
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,146
Some people say that it has
been there since Bheem's time.

365
00:30:23,315 --> 00:30:26,146
Some say that it has been
there since Ravan's time.

366
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:28,146
And some say that Madhav
and Paro used to come here..

367
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,706
..to meet when
they fell in love.

368
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,386
Actually, read carefully.
Paro and Madhav.

369
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,261
It is called Pa Ma
because Pa from Paro..

370
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:35,306
..and Ma from Madhav.

371
00:30:35,386 --> 00:30:36,866
You will get what you wish for.

372
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:41,983
The lovers come here,
stand near the tree and say..

373
00:30:42,063 --> 00:30:47,334
..O tree, shower your flowers
as blessings if our love is true.

374
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:53,466
Do you know why I have 
brought you here? - No.

375
00:30:54,027 --> 00:30:55,626
That day you had become
nervous on coming here.

376
00:30:56,135 --> 00:30:58,588
I thought if there is
some ghost hiding here..

377
00:30:58,794 --> 00:31:00,026
..I will bash it up.

378
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:02,577
That way.

379
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:04,146
I have drunk just
half of the bottle.

380
00:31:04,226 --> 00:31:05,767
He has forgotten
madam Saraswati.

381
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:08,226
I haven't forgotten
madam Saraswati.

382
00:31:08,306 --> 00:31:10,466
What a song it was!
It went somewhat like this..

383
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:33,026
"But I can't live without you."

384
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:44,080
"I don't know how
much I love you."

385
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,533
Stop it! 
Stop singing this song!

386
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:50,026
How dare you sing it?

387
00:32:22,763 --> 00:32:24,083
We have met before.

388
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,083
That day I had seen
you at the theatre.

389
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:30,363
No, before that.
Some other place.

390
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:35,243
Have you ever come 
to Chandigarh? - No.

391
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,243
Where do you live?

392
00:32:38,683 --> 00:32:40,843
Mumbai.
- I have never been to Mumbai.

393
00:32:42,523 --> 00:32:44,003
But the eyes can be deceived.

394
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,896
But my heart says that
we have met before.

395
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:49,243
Chandramukhi.

396
00:32:50,923 --> 00:32:53,020
I'm Dr. Naresh. 
- Mohan Kapoor.

397
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,523
Nice meeting you. - Pleasure.

398
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,083
This is Karuna. - Hello.

399
00:32:56,523 --> 00:32:58,843
Shall we go? See you again.

400
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:02,243
I am the guide!

401
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,243
Strange!
You didn't introduce me!

402
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:07,243
You didn't introduce me to
that beautiful girl! What's this?

403
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:58,243
'Madhav!' - Madhav!

404
00:33:58,761 --> 00:34:00,683
Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi!

405
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,683
No, dear.
Calm down, dear. It's okay.

406
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:06,003
Enough, enough.

407
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:10,523
Naresh! - Yes?

408
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:13,603
Naresh, come fast. - Okay.

409
00:34:16,977 --> 00:34:18,443
What happened? - Chandramukhi..

410
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:19,528
What happened to her?

411
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:20,728
What happened to Chandramukhi?

412
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,674
She suddenly woke up screaming.

413
00:34:23,258 --> 00:34:24,469
She had a nightmare..

414
00:34:25,245 --> 00:34:26,405
Did she have such
a dream earlier?

415
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,525
Last night, she had
the same dream.

416
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:31,605
Last night she was screaming, 
'He will die! He will die!'.

417
00:34:31,845 --> 00:34:34,845
And today.. today she was 
screaming, 'Madhav! Madhav!'

418
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:36,005
Son, come immediately.

419
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:37,165
Go, son. - Let's go.

420
00:34:37,245 --> 00:34:38,525
Hurry up. - Don't worry, 
everything will be fine.

421
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:40,685
Good morning.
- Naresh has come with me.

422
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:42,501
You took the trouble
to come so early.

423
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,405
It's my duty. - Please come.

424
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:54,405
Hi. - It's not so bad 
that I'll need a doctor.

425
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,405
But it does need a friend.

426
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:00,245
What's this I hear
about your dream?

427
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:03,165
Yes, Naresh. For two nights 
I am having the same dream.

428
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:05,525
But who gave you the
permission to fall sick..

429
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,794
..and lie in bed?

430
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:10,245
Come on, get up. You and I 
are going to have coffee.

431
00:35:14,005 --> 00:35:18,557
"Forget it dear,
why are you sad?"

432
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:23,085
"Keep laughing, be happy."

433
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:27,765
"Forget it dear,
why are you sad?"

434
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:32,685
"Keep laughing, be happy."

435
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:38,005
"All your complaints 
will be over."

436
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:42,405
"Keep hugging me."

437
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:47,085
"Forget it dear,
why are you sad?"

438
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:52,245
"Keep laughing, be happy."

439
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:21,102
"Forget it dear,
why are you sad?"

440
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:26,102
"Keep laughing, be happy."

441
00:36:26,502 --> 00:36:30,782
"Forget it dear,
why are you sad?"

442
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,502
"Keep laughing, be happy."

443
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:40,782
"All your complaints 
will be over."

444
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:45,502
"Keep hugging me."

445
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:49,942
"Forget it dear,
why are you sad?"

446
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:55,262
"Keep laughing, be happy."

447
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:18,791
"Look with smiling
beautiful eyes.."

448
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:21,782
"..how the atmosphere changes."

449
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:29,686
"O darling, the face
lights up like this."

450
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:32,806
"Look with smiling
beautiful eyes.."

451
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:36,686
"..how the atmosphere changes."

452
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:43,686
"O darling, the face
lights up like this."

453
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:57,686
"Forget it dear..
why are you sad?"

454
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:02,686
"Keep laughing, be happy."

455
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:07,446
"Forget it dear..
why are you sad?"

456
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,446
"Keep laughing, be happy."

457
00:38:33,046 --> 00:38:39,286
"Come let us lose ourselves, 
let your lips smile."

458
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:46,686
"Let the spring bloom
in these streets."

459
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:54,046
"Come let us lose ourselves, 
let your lips smile."

460
00:38:54,362 --> 00:39:01,551
"Let the spring bloom
in these streets."

461
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,654
Was it nice? - Yes.

462
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,300
Come. Waiter, two coffees.

463
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,420
"Forget it dear.."

464
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,260
Do you remember you
had mentioned Mr. Tom..

465
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,623
..when you had
come to our house?

466
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,900
Yes.

467
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,980
In the jungle, you
suddenly became nervous.

468
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:38,140
Then you stated
getting terrifying dreams.

469
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:40,742
And now something happens
to you when you see this lawyer.

470
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:42,140
What's the matter?

471
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:44,420
Naresh, I don't know.

472
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,820
Whenever I see him, I feel
as if I have met him before.

473
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:52,099
"All your complaints 
will be over."

474
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:55,900
"Keep hugging me."

475
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,580
Chandramukhi, I am
worried about you.

476
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:02,980
If you permit me, I can
treat your mental condition.

477
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:04,340
How, Naresh?

478
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,500
By hypnotizing you.

479
00:40:08,331 --> 00:40:11,420
I will put you into deep sleep, but
your mind will be under my control.

480
00:40:11,714 --> 00:40:14,140
Then you will answer correctly
whatever questions I ask.

481
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,868
So? - On getting the answer,
that matter will come out..

482
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,740
..which has been
troubling your mind.

483
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,740
When we find the root cause, 
the illness will be cured.

484
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,260
I have no illness. - Not illness, 
there is some confusion..

485
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,420
..in your mind,
which can be solved.

486
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,467
And when I wake
you up from sleep..

487
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:32,740
..you won't remember
what you had told me.

488
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:35,140
But your treatment
will be within my power.

489
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:40,140
Close your eyes.

490
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,140
Lean back and relax.

491
00:40:52,603 --> 00:40:54,900
Completely relax your body.

492
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,140
Do not think of anything.

493
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,420
Now you will feel sleepy.

494
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,300
You are falling asleep.

495
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,140
Now you will not wake
up until I wake you up.

496
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,140
You cannot hear
anything except my voice.

497
00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:30,340
You will answer whatever I ask.

498
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,340
What is your name?

499
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,636
Chandramukhi.

500
00:41:36,716 --> 00:41:39,188
What is your age? - 20.

501
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,900
Now you will go back
into your past life.

502
00:41:44,614 --> 00:41:46,140
Your age is 15 years.

503
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,900
What is your age? - 15.

504
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:50,820
What are you doing?

505
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,140
I am with mummy.

506
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,140
Is anyone troubling you?

507
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,060
No.

508
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:59,820
Now go further
back in your life.

509
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:05,900
What is your age?

To which place he belongs?

518
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,140
Is it your mansion? - No.
my father is a gardener there.

519
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,340
Which year is it? - 1945.

520
00:42:51,664 --> 00:42:52,740
1945!

521
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,740
1945. Name, Paro. Age 20.
Madhav is her fiancé!

522
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:05,361
I think she has regressed
into her past birth.

523
00:43:05,902 --> 00:43:07,740
Yes, doctor, it seems so.

524
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:10,733
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

525
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,980
I have never treated a patient
who is troubled by past birth.

526
00:43:15,728 --> 00:43:17,580
Try asking some more questions.
- No, no.

527
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,980
I will have to immediately bring
her back to conscious state..

528
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,140
..or else it will become risky.

529
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,064
If I fail to bring her
back to consciousness..

530
00:43:26,248 --> 00:43:28,580
..she will remain insane
for the rest of her life!

531
00:43:36,604 --> 00:43:41,980
Chandramukhi. Paro. - Yes?

532
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:49,466
Paro, return to the
life of Chandramukhi.

533
00:43:50,946 --> 00:43:52,706
You will do what I ask.

534
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:55,786
You are Chandramukhi.

535
00:43:56,466 --> 00:43:57,626
You are Chandramukhi!

536
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:07,786
Chandramukhi. Chandramukhi!

537
00:44:11,058 --> 00:44:12,346
Oh, God!

538
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:19,106
Now..now you are
waking up from sleep.

539
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:23,466
Chandramukhi, wake up.

540
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:27,186
Open your eyes.

541
00:44:33,891 --> 00:44:38,106
Oh, Naresh. I am very tired.

542
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:47,346
Is something form her
past birth troubling her?

543
00:44:48,106 --> 00:44:49,626
Yes. - What's the remedy?

544
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:51,706
We will have to
proceed very carefully.

545
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:54,346
Keep agreeing to
whatever she says.

546
00:44:56,186 --> 00:44:58,186
Apart from Madhav, 
she refers to some mansion.

547
00:44:58,692 --> 00:45:00,692
Here, every large bungalow
is called a mansion.

548
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:02,626
Didn't she tell you the
name of the mansion?

549
00:45:03,106 --> 00:45:06,346
No. She mentions some village.

550
00:45:06,546 --> 00:45:08,346
Badhai village. 
- Yes, there is.

551
00:45:08,649 --> 00:45:10,346
At the foot of Shimla, there
is Lord Hanuman's temple.

552
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,786
The village behind
it is Badhai village.

553
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:15,466
I will call someone
from the municipality..

554
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,626
..and check the map of Shimla.

555
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:19,106
It's possible that we can
find out where the mansion is.

556
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:21,026
First we will take
her to the village.

557
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:22,626
Her memory may refresh.

558
00:45:22,866 --> 00:45:24,466
She may do something
on seeing something..

559
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:26,186
..which will help
in her treatment.

560
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,182
This is Madhav's house.

561
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:16,906
Listen, children, whose house 
is this? - We don't know.

562
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:19,036
Nobody lives there.
- Nobody lives there?

563
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,414
This is Madhav's house.
- Who is Madhav?

564
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:25,057
Madhav died long time back.

565
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:26,960
Do you remember when?

566
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,074
I don't know. There was 
British rule at that time.

567
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:30,444
It must have been
about 25-30 years.

568
00:46:30,524 --> 00:46:31,924
He had a sister also. - Yes.

569
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:34,044
Satto. - Yes, yes, Satto.

570
00:46:34,204 --> 00:46:36,604
But I don't know where she is!
Whether she is alive or dead!

571
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:37,942
Yesterday someone had come.

572
00:46:38,022 --> 00:46:39,284
She cleaned the
house and went away.

573
00:46:39,953 --> 00:46:41,013
Who was she? - I don't know.

574
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:42,223
Will she come again?

575
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:44,656
She left after cleaning.
Who knows she may come again..

576
00:46:44,736 --> 00:46:45,924
Who can tell?

577
00:46:53,684 --> 00:46:54,764
Do you remember anything more?

578
00:46:58,591 --> 00:46:59,604
Let us go further.

579
00:47:14,029 --> 00:47:16,364
Who are they?
- Must be taking census.

580
00:47:16,797 --> 00:47:19,124
And who are they? - They must be 
from income tax department.

581
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,364
Let us go. - Come.

582
00:47:20,981 --> 00:47:22,738
Madam! It's you! Hello.

583
00:47:22,818 --> 00:47:26,026
I had come to take the
lawyer around the orchard..

584
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:27,258
..but you are drunk again.

585
00:47:27,964 --> 00:47:30,098
Now, I am surely going to
complain to papa about you.

586
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:31,978
Here is your salary.

587
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,658
Madam, these days I
have stopped drinking.

588
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:38,978
Sir, do you drink? - No.

589
00:47:39,261 --> 00:47:40,299
How can I drink?

590
00:47:40,548 --> 00:47:42,234
Come, I will take you
around the orchard.

591
00:47:43,748 --> 00:47:45,127
This way, this way.

592
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:47,348
Hurry up, I have got my salary.

593
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:57,973
Do you mean that there
is no such mansion in..

594
00:47:58,053 --> 00:47:59,953
..the map of Shimla? 
- No, sir.

595
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:01,213
Isn't there any house too? - No.

596
00:49:04,613 --> 00:49:06,293
Meet the bride.
- Congratulations, Julie.

597
00:49:08,374 --> 00:49:09,736
Congratulations!

598
00:49:10,104 --> 00:49:11,973
Lucky Tom.
- Thank you. Thank you.

599
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:13,693
Congratulations to you.
- Congratulations.

600
00:49:13,773 --> 00:49:15,613
May I kiss the bride?
- Only once.

601
00:49:27,943 --> 00:49:29,013
No one will come forward.

602
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:37,693
I have heard that your son has
decided to resign from the army.

603
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:42,293
Sir, nowadays 
I don't keep well.

604
00:49:42,973 --> 00:49:45,453
And it is necessary
to look after the lands.

605
00:49:46,246 --> 00:49:47,373
Therefore.. - Hello, sir.

606
00:49:47,453 --> 00:49:49,453
Come, son, we were
talking about you only.

607
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:52,853
Father, you look tired.
This may take some time.

608
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:55,293
Let me escort you. - You see how 
my son takes care of me.

609
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,533
Yes, yes. - Come.

610
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:01,133
I suggest you go to Kashmir 
for your honeymoon.

611
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,613
Yes, sir.
- Fishing is wonderful.

612
00:50:02,693 --> 00:50:03,773
Hey, girl! 
Where are you going?

613
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:05,923
It's all right, move back.

614
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:08,053
Madam, this is for you.

615
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,113
For me? How sweet! - Yes, sir,
you were talking about Kashmir, right?

616
00:50:10,193 --> 00:50:12,427
But I don't think you will have
much time for fishing, will you?

617
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:13,296
Thank you.

618
00:50:13,376 --> 00:50:14,747
No, sir, I'm sure we won't.

619
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:16,507
Meet me in the evening.
- Well, sir, thank you very much.

620
00:50:17,747 --> 00:50:18,827
Well, Julie.
- Happy times, Julie.

621
00:50:18,907 --> 00:50:20,347
How are you?
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

622
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:22,085
That's all, I hope.
- Right, sir.

623
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:28,507
Rickshaw! Rickshaw!

624
00:50:31,415 --> 00:50:34,347
Cheers to Tom and
his beautiful bride!

625
00:50:34,842 --> 00:50:35,747
Cheers!

626
00:51:02,413 --> 00:51:03,493
Darling!

627
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:48,093
Hey, Paro, it's sweet.

628
00:51:49,905 --> 00:51:52,333
What? - This.

629
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:57,933
Who says it's sweet?

630
00:51:58,773 --> 00:52:04,493
Sir to madam. 
- What did he say?

631
00:52:06,013 --> 00:52:12,933
He said 'sweet' in English.
It means it is sweet.

632
00:52:15,413 --> 00:52:16,493
This.

633
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,493
This is not sweet.

634
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:26,493
This is sweet.

635
00:52:27,093 --> 00:52:28,173
Liar.

636
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:32,493
For you, this is sweet
and for me, this is sweet.

637
00:52:36,173 --> 00:52:37,253
Look.

638
00:52:40,613 --> 00:52:41,853
Madhav. - What?

639
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,933
Someone may see us.

640
00:52:44,413 --> 00:52:45,493
Wait.

641
00:53:11,093 --> 00:53:12,333
It's not sweet.

642
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:32,271
"O dear, what magic
have you cast?"

643
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:40,206
"O dear, what magic
have you cast?"

644
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:44,126
"My crazy heart
chants your name."

645
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:48,046
"O dear, what magic
have you cast?"

646
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,926
"My crazy heart
chants your name."

647
00:53:52,671 --> 00:53:58,446
"What did you do to me
holding in your arms, O darling?"

648
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:01,926
"O dear, what magic
have you cast?"

649
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:06,366
"My crazy heart
chants your name."

650
00:54:15,028 --> 00:54:16,206
"It's not sweet."

651
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:44,920
"You called me near, hugged
me and changed my world."

652
00:54:45,439 --> 00:54:52,446
"The view is different, there are
new signs, it's not the same world."

653
00:54:53,206 --> 00:55:00,366
"You called me near, hugged
me and changed my world."

654
00:55:00,877 --> 00:55:07,926
"The view is different, there are
new signs, it's not the same world."

655
00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:14,686
"What did you do to me by
showing dreams, O darling?"

656
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:17,926
"O dear, what magic
have you cast?"

657
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:21,846
"My crazy heart
chants your name."

658
00:55:57,926 --> 00:56:04,926
"O darling, why is my
heart beating so fast?"

659
00:56:05,526 --> 00:56:12,206
"Just like the ripples in the
river, my body feels a thrill."

660
00:56:13,491 --> 00:56:20,286
"O darling, why is my
heart beating so fast?"

661
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:27,926
"Just like the ripples in the
river, my body feels a thrill."

662
00:56:28,962 --> 00:56:34,606
"What did you do by
uniting with me, O darling?"

663
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:38,085
"O dear, what magic
have you cast?"

664
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:42,042
"My crazy heart
chants your name."

665
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:48,546
"What did you do to me
holding in your arms, O darling?"

666
00:56:48,626 --> 00:56:51,599
"O dear, what magic
have you cast?"

667
00:56:52,561 --> 00:56:55,685
"My crazy heart
chants your name."

668
00:56:59,897 --> 00:57:02,621
Have you written this 
name, Madhav? - Yes.

669
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:05,767
Paro, this name will keep our
love alive for hundreds of years.

670
00:57:10,653 --> 00:57:12,327
Now you will ask me to
take you to the mansion.

671
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,327
I don't like the mansion.

672
00:57:15,237 --> 00:57:18,687
Madhav, I too do not like to
leave you and go to the mansion.

673
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:22,327
Take me away from
the mansion forever.

674
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:28,327
Paro, I will talk to Mr. Tom and
take you away from the mansion.

675
00:57:36,664 --> 00:57:38,717
Chandramukhi! Chandramukhi!

676
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:41,277
Oh.

677
00:57:54,797 --> 00:57:56,797
I apologize on behalf
of Chandramukhi.

678
00:57:56,957 --> 00:57:58,037
She is not feeling well.

679
00:57:58,448 --> 00:57:59,597
Oh, I see.

680
00:58:00,026 --> 00:58:02,037
If you have no objection,
please come to my house.

681
00:58:02,197 --> 00:58:03,437
I have something
important to talk to you.

682
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:05,517
Please.

683
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,357
Okay. - Thank you.

684
00:58:14,277 --> 00:58:15,357
Let us go.

685
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:18,437
Chandramukhi's mental
condition is a bit delicate.

686
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:21,399
She thinks that she knows
you from your past birth..

687
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,277
..and at that time your
name was Madhav.

688
00:58:23,437 --> 00:58:26,197
But why can't I remember
that I knew her in her past birth?

689
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,597
Didn't I tell you that her
mental condition is delicate?

690
00:58:30,525 --> 00:58:33,541
Please don't feel offended if
she addresses you as Madhav..

691
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:36,037
..otherwise, there is the
risk of a shock to her mind.

692
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:39,437
And please do tell me if
she mentions a mansion.

693
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,437
You are a doctor.
Do you believe in past births?

694
00:58:44,197 --> 00:58:48,277
She believes in it. I do not 
object because I'm treating her.

695
00:58:48,797 --> 00:58:49,877
That is why I troubled you.

696
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:52,925
Please, do come
if I call you again.

697
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:55,877
I will need you
for the treatment.

698
00:58:56,136 --> 00:58:58,035
Doctor, I don't want
to get involved..

699
00:58:58,115 --> 00:58:59,876
..in the illusions of
some girl's mind..

700
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:02,797
..and I don't have time to
come here again and again.

701
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:06,437
I am not interested in past
births and I don't believe in it.

702
00:59:06,517 --> 00:59:08,877
But on the basis of compassion..
- Madhav!

703
00:59:14,877 --> 00:59:19,437
Chandramukhi, he
is Mr. Mohan Kapoor..

704
00:59:19,649 --> 00:59:20,597
..not Madhav.

705
00:59:24,357 --> 00:59:28,881
Dr.Naresh thinks that 
I have a mental illness.

706
00:59:29,117 --> 00:59:32,167
Chandramukhi, not illness,
it's some kind of confusion..

707
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:33,597
..which will be resolved.

708
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:44,197
Will you come again? - I will 
surely come if you call me.

709
00:59:45,529 --> 00:59:47,197
Will you come
everyday if I call you?

710
00:59:53,194 --> 00:59:54,597
I laugh a lot.

711
00:59:54,902 --> 00:59:57,357
Mr. Mohan will come to
meet us, right, Mr. Mohan?

712
01:00:04,797 --> 01:00:05,877
Will you come?

713
01:00:14,037 --> 01:00:15,117
Yes, I will come.

714
01:00:16,037 --> 01:00:17,597
She thinks I am Madhav.

715
01:00:17,797 --> 01:00:19,077
Something about past birth.

716
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:21,797
Do I look like Madhav to you?

717
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:27,597
What are you doing?

718
01:00:28,211 --> 01:00:31,197
Papa likes to have his name
embroidered on handkerchiefs.

719
01:00:31,465 --> 01:00:33,797
J. S. - Janak Singh.

720
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,045
Earlier, my grandma used
to do this, then my mother..

721
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,340
..and now I do it.

722
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,500
It's very beautiful.
- Shall I make for you as well?

723
01:00:40,741 --> 01:00:42,211
Well, for the time
being, I will take this.

724
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:45,140
No, it is said that if you gift
a handkerchief to someone..

725
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,190
..it causes a fight.

726
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:47,980
Old beliefs.

727
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,180
But that girl talks
very affectionately.

728
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,660
In a strange manner.

729
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:58,740
Oh, I have to go and meet 
the priest. Will you come with me?

730
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,060
Sure, why not?

731
01:01:00,234 --> 01:01:01,980
She made me promise
to go there again.

732
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,500
But it is not appropriate
for me to go there.

733
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,020
I am surprised that
the doctor insists on it.

734
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,420
He says that it is very
important for me to go there..

735
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,580
..for that girl's treatment.

736
01:01:09,347 --> 01:01:11,140
He said that? - Yes.

737
01:01:12,006 --> 01:01:13,180
Should I go there?

738
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,300
You should definitely
go if she is ill.

739
01:01:16,762 --> 01:01:18,980
Don't you believe 
in past birth?

740
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,980
In childhood we are taught 
that there is rebirth.

741
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,500
But after growing up
and getting education..

742
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,660
..that belief is shattered.

743
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,500
Do you believe in past birth?

744
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:30,460
I? Oh, hello, priest.

745
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,340
Bless you, dear!

746
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,599
Papa couldn't come today.
- No problem.

747
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:35,994
Priest. - Yes, son?

748
01:01:36,074 --> 01:01:37,380
Is there a past birth?

749
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,134
Surely, there is.

750
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:42,319
If there was no cycle
of births, how could..

751
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:43,930
..the Bhrigu Scrolls have
turned out to be accurate?

752
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,900
Bhrigu Scrolls. - Sage Bhrigu
had written the Bhrigu Scrolls..

753
01:01:47,097 --> 01:01:48,660
..centuries ago.

754
01:01:49,141 --> 01:01:51,580
They refer to the lives
of thousands of people..

755
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:55,100
..those who are dead, who are
alive, and those who will be born.

756
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,780
Then there must be reference to
papa and maybe about me also.

757
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,340
Why not? - That's amazing.

758
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:00,881
One day I will 
come to see you.

759
01:02:00,961 --> 01:02:02,540
Maybe there is something about 
me as well. - Yes, yes.

760
01:02:02,935 --> 01:02:04,180
Bye. - Bye.

761
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,980
I will never be able
to forget your song.

762
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:21,725
Priest, papa has sent Rs.
1000 for the temple.

763
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,260
Thank you. - Karuna!

764
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,980
Hello. - Bless you.

765
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,380
I will always
remember your song.

766
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,180
Hadn't I said that Karuna
will also say the same thing?

767
01:02:33,012 --> 01:02:34,260
Blessings to both of you.

768
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:40,500
On seeing you, I feel
a kind of happiness.

769
01:02:43,412 --> 01:02:46,220
The people of the village have
invited me to the fair tomorrow.

770
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,660
Perhaps they are going to
sing one of my old folk songs.

771
01:02:51,153 --> 01:02:53,300
I used to sing it
when I was young.

772
01:02:54,245 --> 01:02:55,715
Why don't you come with me?

773
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:06,189
"It's not the rainy season."

774
01:03:06,269 --> 01:03:09,580
"It's not the rainy season."

775
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,700
"O beautiful one, tell me..

776
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:19,260
..where did the lightning
flash without the clouds?"

777
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:26,503
"Where did the lightning
flash without the clouds?"

778
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,460
"You haven't seen anything yet."

779
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,900
"You haven't seen anything yet."

780
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:42,900
"Lift your gaze and look."

781
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:48,660
"The lightning flashed
here without the clouds."

782
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:56,380
"The lightning flashed
here without the clouds."

783
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:23,460
"On hearing about the fair,
I have come to your town."

784
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:29,700
"On hearing about the fair,
I have come to your town."

785
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:36,900
"O dear, do me a favour,
shelter me under your veil."

786
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:43,100
"O dear, do me a favour,
shelter me under your veil."

787
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:49,980
"It might strike my heart,
it might strike my heart..

788
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,900
..my heart is trembling."

789
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:59,700
"Where did the lightning
flash without the clouds?"

790
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:06,100
"Where did the lightning
flash without the clouds?"

791
01:05:33,237 --> 01:05:39,980
"Can't you see the bright sun?
Are you blind?"

792
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:46,180
"Can't you see the bright sun?
Are you blind?"

793
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:52,980
"Crazy man, it's not lightning,
it's my dazzling beauty."

794
01:05:53,258 --> 01:05:59,300
"Crazy man, it's not lightning,
it's my dazzling beauty."

795
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:05,980
"If I swayed a bit,
if I swayed a bit..

796
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:08,900
..my earrings dangled."

797
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:15,660
"The lightning flashed
here without the clouds."

798
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:21,460
"The lightning flashed
here without the clouds."

799
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,958
"It's not the rainy season."

800
01:06:26,038 --> 01:06:28,980
"It's not the rainy season."

801
01:06:29,271 --> 01:06:32,111
"O beautiful one, tell me.."

802
01:06:32,191 --> 01:06:38,271
"..where did the lightning
flash without the clouds?"

803
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:44,671
"Without the clouds..
- The lightning flashed here."

804
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:50,791
"Without the clouds..
- The lightning flashed here."

805
01:06:50,871 --> 01:06:52,271
Excuse me, please come with me.

806
01:06:53,295 --> 01:06:54,231
I think she is again
having the attack.

807
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:56,431
"..flashed here."

808
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,631
Who are you searching for?
The girl who came with you?

809
01:06:58,711 --> 01:06:59,711
Yes. - She went in 
that direction.

810
01:07:00,192 --> 01:07:01,316
In that direction? - Yes.

811
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:04,191
Follow her. She will 
surely talk to you.

812
01:07:13,186 --> 01:07:14,351
This!

813
01:07:24,391 --> 01:07:25,671
Chandramukhi,
what are you thinking?

814
01:07:28,231 --> 01:07:29,711
I am just wandering aimlessly.

815
01:07:30,911 --> 01:07:31,991
Why did you come here?

816
01:07:32,288 --> 01:07:33,511
Go away!

817
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:38,231
No, please don't go, Mohan.

818
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:40,871
Please don't go.

819
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:43,351
Don't go.

820
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:45,871
Look what I have
brought for you.

821
01:07:54,511 --> 01:07:56,271
Don't you remember? - What?

822
01:07:57,711 --> 01:07:59,911
We had met
before, at this place.

823
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:03,231
That day? - Before that day.

824
01:08:04,911 --> 01:08:05,991
Much before.

825
01:08:07,311 --> 01:08:11,231
You had written this.
You had given this to me.

826
01:08:13,711 --> 01:08:16,191
Come with me. - Where?

827
01:08:17,271 --> 01:08:18,831
Where we had met.

828
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:24,591
Do you remember, 
I was waiting for you?

829
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:39,871
Madhav! Madhav!

830
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,191
For me? - No, I will wear it.

831
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:47,271
Look, what's written on it?

832
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,711
What?

833
01:08:51,991 --> 01:08:54,431
Madhav. Paro. Madhav. Paro.

834
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:00,871
Madhav! - What?

835
01:09:02,111 --> 01:09:04,591
Won't you ever ask? - What?

836
01:09:05,111 --> 01:09:06,311
How much I love you?

837
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:08,391
How much?

838
01:09:09,685 --> 01:09:14,991
From one end of the sky to 
the other end. Even beyond that.

839
01:09:15,383 --> 01:09:19,191
This much. And how much 
do you love me?

840
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:22,654
Tell me!

841
01:09:24,974 --> 01:09:30,014
Paro, I don't know
how much I love you.

842
01:09:30,681 --> 01:09:39,454
"But I cannot live without you."

843
01:09:42,014 --> 01:09:47,294
"I don't know how much..

844
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,934
..I love you."

845
01:09:53,512 --> 01:10:02,014
"But I can't live without you."

846
01:10:03,393 --> 01:10:10,934
"I don't know how
much I love you."

847
01:10:11,054 --> 01:10:17,374
"But I can't live without you."

848
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:22,014
"How much I love you.."

849
01:10:52,172 --> 01:10:59,090
"I have heard that people
carry the pain of separation."

850
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:06,174
"God knows how
they pass their lives?"

851
01:11:07,057 --> 01:11:13,774
"To me one day
passes like a year."

852
01:11:14,332 --> 01:11:21,374
"I don't know how
long I can wait for you."

853
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:27,694
"But I can't live without you."

854
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:32,574
"How much I love you.."

855
01:12:04,249 --> 01:12:10,374
"If anybody glances
at you, I feel jealous."

856
01:12:11,384 --> 01:12:17,734
"Then with great
difficulty I control myself."

857
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:25,374
"How would you
know what all I do?"

858
01:12:26,011 --> 01:12:33,014
"I don't know how
restless my heart is."

859
01:12:33,288 --> 01:12:39,494
"But I can't live without you."

860
01:12:40,887 --> 01:12:47,601
"I don't know how
much I love you."

861
01:12:48,065 --> 01:12:54,454
"But I can't live without you."

862
01:12:55,622 --> 01:13:01,774
"How much I love you.."

863
01:13:06,897 --> 01:13:09,057
Take out your knife. - Why?

864
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:14,897
Take this. - Cut.

865
01:13:15,201 --> 01:13:16,217
Shall I cut your hair?

866
01:13:16,297 --> 01:13:17,377
Cut it!

867
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:24,097
Madhav. Paro.

868
01:13:43,947 --> 01:13:44,977
What are you doing?

869
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:07,817
This tree will keep
us alive for 100 years.

870
01:14:09,152 --> 01:14:11,817
This earth will keep
us alive forever.

871
01:14:27,025 --> 01:14:28,217
Do you remember anything?

872
01:14:30,246 --> 01:14:35,457
I can clearly see, 
you are Madhav. I am Paro.

873
01:14:36,485 --> 01:14:37,617
Don't you remember?

874
01:14:41,317 --> 01:14:46,817
Mohan, we can't believe
it, but we can't deny it also.

875
01:15:26,046 --> 01:15:28,617
What is it?
- The symbol of our love.

876
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:33,817
Madhav. Paro.
- When will you realize it?

877
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:36,458
Will you realize 
it after I die?

878
01:15:37,063 --> 01:15:39,020
Or will you realize it
in some other birth?

879
01:15:39,939 --> 01:15:41,377
Chandramukhi,
don't think that way.

880
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:46,617
Am I trying to misguide you?
Don't you believe me?

881
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:52,817
I believe. I do believe it 
when I am with you.

882
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:55,297
Then please always 
stay with me.

883
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,057
Always believe me.

884
01:15:57,817 --> 01:16:02,977
Mohan, how could you
live without me for so long?

885
01:16:06,617 --> 01:16:08,097
I don't know how I could live.

886
01:16:09,737 --> 01:16:14,417
Mohan, do you love me?
- Yes, yes, I do.

887
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:16,817
Chandramukhi, I love
you, I love you very much.

888
01:16:18,337 --> 01:16:19,817
I have loved you since
I don't know when.

889
01:16:20,217 --> 01:16:21,937
I love you more than my life.

890
01:16:23,097 --> 01:16:27,817
Madhav, take me away
from the mansion forever.

891
01:16:29,937 --> 01:16:31,977
Mansion? 
Where is the mansion?

892
01:16:32,737 --> 01:16:33,897
Chandramukhi,
where is the mansion?

893
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:35,257
Tell me! Tell me!

894
01:16:36,023 --> 01:16:37,418
I don't know!

895
01:16:37,807 --> 01:16:39,017
I don't know anything!

896
01:16:39,612 --> 01:16:41,461
I don't remember anything!

897
01:16:42,057 --> 01:16:43,297
I don't remember anything!

898
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,177
Mohan, I can't
remember anything.

899
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:48,297
What happens to you?

900
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:58,370
Did Mohan talk to you
about engagement?

901
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:01,890
Not yet.
- What objection can he have?

902
01:17:02,144 --> 01:17:03,730
We will have a
party next Sunday..

903
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,046
..and we will announce
the engagement at that time.

904
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:08,609
But papa, give him
a chance to speak.

905
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:10,450
What more can
he wish for in life?

906
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:13,604
And it is enough for me
that my daughter loves him.

907
01:17:13,684 --> 01:17:15,250
This engagement
cannot take place.

908
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:24,770
Suddenly my life has changed and I..
I have become helpless.

909
01:17:25,291 --> 01:17:28,970
Chandramukhi? - Yes.

910
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:32,410
And you believed
in her past birth?

911
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:38,730
Yes, she talked as if she was
trying to remind me of something.

912
01:17:39,042 --> 01:17:41,890
There was a kind of lightning
flash, a curtain was raised..

913
01:17:42,436 --> 01:17:46,930
..some fog was cleared..
I just believed it.

914
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:49,170
She is very lucky.

915
01:17:50,594 --> 01:17:57,303
Karuna, if ever I can be
of help to you in my life..

916
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,394
..I will consider
it my good luck.

917
01:18:00,298 --> 01:18:03,634
Just.. just forgive me 
for this mistake.

918
01:18:03,822 --> 01:18:05,382
Leave it, forget it.

919
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,302
God hasn't given me good luck..

920
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:10,662
..but He has given
me a generous heart.

921
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:13,622
I have a request.

922
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:15,595
Tell me.

923
01:18:15,675 --> 01:18:18,302
Do bring Chandramukhi
to our party.

924
01:18:18,702 --> 01:18:21,062
I will personally announce
your engagement with her..

925
01:18:21,142 --> 01:18:22,342
..in front of everybody.

926
01:18:22,422 --> 01:18:25,382
No, no! I can't do that.
It's not possible.

927
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:27,342
Mohan, give me 
that much right.

928
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,902
Let me share your happiness.

929
01:18:35,902 --> 01:18:36,982
Promise?

930
01:18:47,066 --> 01:18:48,662
It will be as I wish!

931
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:51,702
How did Mohan dare to refuse?

932
01:18:52,698 --> 01:18:54,902
It's impossible to not
have this engagement.

933
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:58,382
Tell the secretary that I
have summoned Mohan.

934
01:18:58,462 --> 01:19:01,942
Papa, he has not refused.
- So, did you commit a mistake?

935
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:05,902
Did you two have a fight?

936
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:07,142
No.

937
01:19:07,693 --> 01:19:09,462
So why can't this
wedding take place?

938
01:19:11,822 --> 01:19:14,702
I want to know.
I want an answer.

939
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:15,902
Papa, this wedding
cannot take place.

940
01:19:15,982 --> 01:19:17,622
Papa, don't I have
a right to my life..

941
01:19:17,702 --> 01:19:21,022
You don't have right
to even raise your voice!

942
01:19:22,072 --> 01:19:24,407
You should be aware
that whatever I do..

943
01:19:24,785 --> 01:19:26,902
..will be for the
well-being of my daughter.

944
01:19:32,287 --> 01:19:33,622
Dunichand! - Yes, sir!

945
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:36,424
Send invitations to all the
officers and aristocrats..

946
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:38,382
..for next Sunday's party.

947
01:19:38,969 --> 01:19:41,862
I will announce Karuna's
engagement at the party.

948
01:19:41,942 --> 01:19:43,131
Okay, sir.

949
01:19:46,352 --> 01:19:48,312
Sir, what have you
decided about your son?

950
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:51,032
He has studied law and he 
is grown up. Get him married.

951
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:52,192
What do you say?

952
01:19:52,272 --> 01:19:54,179
So you were in Chandigarh 
in those days. - Yes. - 'Lila!'

953
01:19:54,482 --> 01:19:55,712
Will Chandramukhi be coming?

954
01:19:57,941 --> 01:20:00,952
Welcome, Judge, welcome.
You made me wait a lot.

955
01:20:01,032 --> 01:20:02,112
Sister-in-law, 
congratulations!

956
01:20:02,192 --> 01:20:03,512
He has become Sessions Judge.

957
01:20:03,592 --> 01:20:04,672
Thank you Mr. Chaudhary.

958
01:20:04,752 --> 01:20:06,222
Okay. You must be 
tired coming all the way.

959
01:20:06,449 --> 01:20:08,672
This mansion is quite far.
Mohan, look after him.

960
01:20:08,752 --> 01:20:11,032
Accountant! Accountant!
- Hello, Mohan, how are you?

961
01:20:11,112 --> 01:20:13,832
Come here. - How are you?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

962
01:20:14,535 --> 01:20:15,712
Yes? - Mohan, come here.

963
01:20:16,405 --> 01:20:18,752
Accountant, ask
people to become quiet.

964
01:20:19,031 --> 01:20:19,952
I want to make 
an announcement. - Okay.

965
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:21,112
Hurry up.

966
01:20:21,464 --> 01:20:22,352
Gentlemen!

967
01:20:30,136 --> 01:20:39,572
"The party has
gathered just like that."

968
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:45,936
"The party has
gathered just like that."

969
01:20:46,136 --> 01:20:50,016
"Let it be colorful."

970
01:20:50,491 --> 01:20:54,016
"The party has
gathered just like that."

971
01:20:54,296 --> 01:20:58,016
"Let it be colourful."

972
01:20:58,376 --> 01:21:05,976
"Let one lamp be put
off, let one lamp be lit."

973
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:10,216
"The party has
gathered just like that."

974
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:14,016
"Let it be colourful."

975
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:21,776
"Let one lamp be put
off, let one lamp be lit."

976
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:26,216
"The party has
gathered just like that."

977
01:21:26,296 --> 01:21:30,616
"Let it be colourful."

978
01:21:46,876 --> 01:21:54,216
"If I feel like it, I
will sing a song."

979
01:21:55,016 --> 01:22:02,416
"This is celebration of
love, let us do it in style."

980
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:14,256
"If I feel like it, I
will sing a song."

981
01:22:15,007 --> 01:22:22,216
"This is celebration of
love, let us do it in style."

982
01:22:22,656 --> 01:22:30,336
"Let this desirable
evening stretch till morning."

983
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:34,272
"The party has
gathered just like that."

984
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:38,016
"Let it be colorful."

985
01:22:38,683 --> 01:22:46,336
"Let one lamp be put
off, let one lamp be lit."

986
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:50,217
"The party has
gathered just like that."

987
01:22:50,456 --> 01:22:54,616
"Let it be colourful."

988
01:22:54,696 --> 01:22:56,416
She hasn't come. - She will.

989
01:22:56,856 --> 01:22:58,456
Naresh, how do I look?

990
01:23:01,216 --> 01:23:06,016
Today, there will be massacre
in that party.. that is how you look.

991
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:11,736
I am feeling a bit nervous.

992
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:13,896
What's the reason?

993
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:21,736
"Now my eyes look
upwards as if in prayer."

994
01:23:22,423 --> 01:23:30,216
"My heartbeats
create a song of love."

995
01:23:34,379 --> 01:23:41,696
"Now my eyes look
upwards as if in prayer."

996
01:23:42,304 --> 01:23:49,456
"My heartbeats
create a song of love."

997
01:23:49,968 --> 01:23:57,736
"Let the desires of
the heart be fulfilled."

998
01:23:58,174 --> 01:24:01,376
"The party has
gathered just like that."

999
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:05,216
"Let it be colourful."

1000
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:13,656
"Let one lamp be put
off, let one lamp be lit."

1001
01:24:14,726 --> 01:24:21,296
"The party has
gathered just like that."

1002
01:24:21,861 --> 01:24:28,216
"Let it be colourful."

1003
01:24:33,029 --> 01:24:34,791
Hello! You are late.

1004
01:24:34,871 --> 01:24:36,189
We are waiting for
you since long time.

1005
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:38,002
Please come.
I'll introduce you to my papa.

1006
01:24:38,389 --> 01:24:41,429
She is Chandramhkhi.
And he is my papa.

1007
01:24:51,861 --> 01:24:55,309
Ill-mannered! Despicable!

1008
01:24:55,818 --> 01:24:57,072
Who is that girl?

1009
01:24:58,229 --> 01:24:59,709
Mohan is going to marry her.

1010
01:25:00,532 --> 01:25:01,429
What did you say?

1011
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:03,469
Mohan is going to marry her.

1012
01:25:03,709 --> 01:25:06,510
Why did you hide
this matter until now?

1013
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:12,380
Chandramhkhi! Chandramhkhi!

1014
01:25:13,753 --> 01:25:16,012
What happened, Chandramhkhi?

1015
01:25:21,104 --> 01:25:22,189
Coffee.

1016
01:25:28,098 --> 01:25:30,012
Chandramhkhi, what happened?

1017
01:25:30,869 --> 01:25:31,949
I don't know.

1018
01:25:32,509 --> 01:25:33,936
Coffee? - No.

1019
01:25:34,606 --> 01:25:36,309
Chandramhkhi, remember it!
Remember!

1020
01:25:37,017 --> 01:25:39,189
Tell something. Why were you 
terrified in this manner?

1021
01:25:39,698 --> 01:25:40,549
What happened?

1022
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:41,789
I don't know.

1023
01:25:45,611 --> 01:25:46,800
She needs rest.

1024
01:25:55,534 --> 01:25:57,621
If she says something, we'll
know something about this mystery.

1025
01:25:58,172 --> 01:25:59,309
Then her treatment
will become easy.

1026
01:25:59,718 --> 01:26:01,509
Hypnotise her once again.
Put her in a deep sleep.

1027
01:26:01,847 --> 01:26:03,054
Perhaps she will be able to
tell something in that condition.

1028
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:04,789
There is a danger if I do that.
- What danger?

1029
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,069
She'll go back 
to her past life.

1030
01:26:06,388 --> 01:26:07,469
And perhaps I won't be
able to bring her back.

1031
01:26:07,642 --> 01:26:08,485
But we have no alternative.

1032
01:26:08,565 --> 01:26:09,789
What if she becomes mad?

1033
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:14,389
Even now she is getting mad.

1034
01:26:15,415 --> 01:26:16,469
I can't take this risk.

1035
01:26:16,549 --> 01:26:18,029
You must try. 
She is your love..

1036
01:26:18,109 --> 01:26:19,309
Don't talk about love.

1037
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:25,470
She loves you!

1038
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:28,629
Then it is my responsibility.

1039
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:31,622
I'll take permission
from her parents.

1040
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:34,949
But you must say yes. 
Say yes.

1041
01:26:37,309 --> 01:26:42,389
Okay. But this is 
the last time.

1042
01:26:46,638 --> 01:26:49,946
Chandramhkhi,
you're in a deep sleep.

1043
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:55,946
You are going back to your
past life when you were Paro.

1044
01:26:57,926 --> 01:26:59,126
Now you're Paro.

1045
01:27:01,606 --> 01:27:04,526
Answer any question
that I ask you.

1046
01:27:06,526 --> 01:27:09,293
What is the connection
of whatever that..

1047
01:27:09,373 --> 01:27:10,806
..happened last
night with your life?

1048
01:27:12,766 --> 01:27:14,526
I'm with Madhav.

1049
01:27:23,086 --> 01:27:25,726
Now I'll very soon take
you away from the mansion.

1050
01:27:26,303 --> 01:27:28,006
You are telling lies. Madhav.

1051
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,606
I'll marry you and
take you with me.

1052
01:27:30,325 --> 01:27:31,606
When?

1053
01:27:32,726 --> 01:27:33,806
Very soon.

1054
01:27:33,886 --> 01:27:37,326
Master told me, take
rupees 200 and get married.

1055
01:27:38,368 --> 01:27:39,606
Master is a nice man.

1056
01:27:40,649 --> 01:27:43,849
Madhav, whenever
I'll see the sunset..

1057
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:46,006
..I'll remember what
you are saying now.

1058
01:27:46,526 --> 01:27:52,166
Paro, now I always see you 
as a bride. All the time.

1059
01:27:52,526 --> 01:27:53,766
I'm feeling very restless.

1060
01:27:54,406 --> 01:27:56,726
It is difficult to stay
till our wedding night.

1061
01:27:56,806 --> 01:27:57,886
Very difficult indeed.

1062
01:27:58,686 --> 01:28:03,046
Madhav, I too will now
see myself as your bride.

1063
01:28:03,267 --> 01:28:04,206
All the time.

1064
01:28:06,802 --> 01:28:08,966
It is going to rain now.
Come on.

1065
01:28:10,326 --> 01:28:12,246
Oh! listen!

1066
01:28:12,726 --> 01:28:18,086
'I don't know how
much I love you.'

1067
01:28:18,926 --> 01:28:20,006
What next, Madhav?

1068
01:28:20,926 --> 01:28:22,846
We are going to 
get married now.

1069
01:28:22,926 --> 01:28:24,142
It is so much fun.

1070
01:28:27,246 --> 01:28:28,657
Oh! - Papa!

1071
01:28:28,737 --> 01:28:30,661
Don't you feel ashamed?

1072
01:28:31,407 --> 01:28:34,246
You may roam about as much
as you want after marriage.

1073
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,086
Get lost.

1074
01:28:36,526 --> 01:28:37,846
What are you looking at?
Get lost.

1075
01:28:39,852 --> 01:28:41,172
Why did you take so long?

1076
01:28:41,612 --> 01:28:43,252
The senior master is unwell.

1077
01:28:43,612 --> 01:28:44,692
He is asleep.

1078
01:28:44,932 --> 01:28:47,932
And listen, the junior master
will come late today. - Okay.

1079
01:28:48,012 --> 01:28:50,412
Go and put wood in the
fireplace in his room soon.

1080
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:52,412
Let me first change my clothes.
They are wet.

1081
01:28:52,492 --> 01:28:53,627
You can change
your clothes later.

1082
01:28:53,707 --> 01:28:54,932
I'm coming back from village.

1083
01:28:55,012 --> 01:28:56,092
You go soon and do all the work.

1084
01:28:57,492 --> 01:29:01,212
Paro, light the big fire.
It is a very severe cold.

1085
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:02,372
Okay.

1086
01:30:52,612 --> 01:31:00,492
'I don't know how
much I love you.'

1087
01:31:01,172 --> 01:31:08,172
'But I can't live without you.'

1088
01:32:54,365 --> 01:32:59,860
'Paro, now I always see you 
as a bride. All the time.'

1089
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,740
'I'm feeling very restless.'

1090
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:04,580
'It is difficult to stay
till our wedding night.'

1091
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:05,740
'Very difficult indeed.'

1092
01:33:06,516 --> 01:33:10,860
'Madhav, I too will now
see myself as your bride.'

1093
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:12,020
'All the time.'

1094
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:19,060
'Wow!
You are looking so lovely.'

1095
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,460
'I'll make you my queen.'

1096
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:28,860
'Look, I've built this
mansion for you.'

1097
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:32,460
'All this is for you.'

1098
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:39,740
'All this is for me.
And I'm for you, Madhav.'

1099
01:33:41,522 --> 01:33:48,740
'Look there, a bed is decorated
here for you and me. Yes!'

1100
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:06,940
Madhav, come to me.

1101
01:34:38,087 --> 01:34:42,167
Paro, come here.
Junior master will come soon.

1102
01:34:44,327 --> 01:34:45,967
The dinner is delayed.

1103
01:34:50,732 --> 01:34:51,967
The rain has stopped.

1104
01:35:44,106 --> 01:35:47,647
Sister Satto! Sister Satto!

1105
01:36:05,499 --> 01:36:06,567
Sister Satto.

1106
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,087
She is lost in the mansion.

1107
01:36:24,516 --> 01:36:26,967
Chandramukhi,
where is this mansion?

1108
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:28,327
I don't know.

1109
01:36:28,407 --> 01:36:30,687
Chandramukhi, who
is the junior master?

1110
01:36:30,927 --> 01:36:32,167
I don't know anything.

1111
01:36:35,487 --> 01:36:37,878
Mohan, the villagers were
saying that somebody..

1112
01:36:38,386 --> 01:36:39,567
..had come to Madhav's house.

1113
01:36:39,769 --> 01:36:40,727
She will come once again.

1114
01:36:40,969 --> 01:36:41,927
We'll find out all about it.

1115
01:36:42,212 --> 01:36:45,564
I'll find out about it. - No, Mohan.
Don't go leaving me alone.

1116
01:36:45,644 --> 01:36:46,699
I'll come back soon.

1117
01:36:46,779 --> 01:36:48,087
No. Please, stay with me.

1118
01:36:49,727 --> 01:36:50,807
I'll go.

1119
01:37:11,542 --> 01:37:12,487
Greetings.

1120
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:17,327
Can you tell me who Satto is?
Where she is?

1121
01:37:24,567 --> 01:37:26,967
Satto is standing before you.
Yes, tell me.

1122
01:37:29,527 --> 01:37:30,807
It is my childhood name.

1123
01:37:31,647 --> 01:37:32,727
I'm doctor Naresh.

1124
01:37:33,887 --> 01:37:35,087
I'm here with 
a strange request.

1125
01:37:35,672 --> 01:37:36,310
Tell me.

1126
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:37,807
One of my patient is
in very critical condition.

1127
01:37:38,137 --> 01:37:39,167
I want your help.

1128
01:37:39,807 --> 01:37:41,807
My help? - Yes, I'll 
be grateful to you.

1129
01:37:41,887 --> 01:37:42,967
We have to go only 
up to Shimla.

1130
01:37:43,487 --> 01:37:46,087
No problem.
I too have to go to Shimla.

1131
01:37:46,645 --> 01:37:48,087
But I don't
understand as to what..

1132
01:37:48,167 --> 01:37:49,964
I'll explain everything
to you on the way.

1133
01:37:50,667 --> 01:37:51,647
Let's go. - Please come.

1134
01:38:17,483 --> 01:38:18,563
Paro!

1135
01:38:20,304 --> 01:38:22,243
Paro! What happened?

1136
01:38:22,953 --> 01:38:24,883
Why are you crying
in this manner?

1137
01:38:25,163 --> 01:38:28,043
Tell me, what happened?
I'm very worried.

1138
01:38:28,243 --> 01:38:29,323
Tell me, what happened?

1139
01:38:30,163 --> 01:38:34,243
Sister Satto. Junior master..
in the mansion..

1140
01:38:34,694 --> 01:38:36,323
What happened? Did he hit you?

1141
01:38:40,877 --> 01:38:42,043
My modesty..

1142
01:38:43,163 --> 01:38:44,963
He has dishonored me.

1143
01:38:45,043 --> 01:38:47,163
Paro! No, Paro.

1144
01:38:48,054 --> 01:38:49,243
Please don't tell
this to Madhav.

1145
01:38:50,281 --> 01:38:51,883
He'll suffer.

1146
01:38:53,233 --> 01:38:54,403
Madhav!

1147
01:38:54,483 --> 01:38:57,163
Are you going to kill her?

1148
01:38:57,563 --> 01:39:00,163
Madhav, come to your senses.

1149
01:39:00,243 --> 01:39:01,323
What madness is this?

1150
01:39:04,318 --> 01:39:05,483
No, Madhav!

1151
01:39:10,502 --> 01:39:11,723
Madhav!

1152
01:39:19,649 --> 01:39:20,843
Madhav!

1153
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:30,043
Madhav!

1154
01:39:31,803 --> 01:39:34,763
Madhav!
Are you going to kill her?

1155
01:39:35,163 --> 01:39:36,403
Yes, I'll kill her.

1156
01:39:38,137 --> 01:39:39,283
Or I'll kill myself.

1157
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:43,163
I'll kill myself.
Or I'll kill him!

1158
01:39:43,531 --> 01:39:46,043
I'll kill the junior master.

1159
01:39:46,163 --> 01:39:47,243
Madhav!

1160
01:40:09,433 --> 01:40:10,643
Madhav!

1161
01:40:13,151 --> 01:40:14,403
Madhav!

1162
01:40:15,363 --> 01:40:16,803
No! - Paro!

1163
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:46,602
Please come.

1164
01:40:53,471 --> 01:40:54,642
Do you know where
this mansion is?

1165
01:40:54,722 --> 01:40:56,002
Everything can be
found out from there.

1166
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:57,562
I don't know.

1167
01:40:57,642 --> 01:40:59,562
Paro's father
worked as a porter.

1168
01:41:00,021 --> 01:41:01,482
I know only this much.

1169
01:41:01,802 --> 01:41:02,882
What happened to Paro?

1170
01:41:03,082 --> 01:41:04,162
I don't know even that.

1171
01:41:04,908 --> 01:41:08,183
After Madhav's
death, I had left Shimla.

1172
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:10,451
How can I find out?

1173
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:11,611
Bhrigu Maharaj.

1174
01:41:12,091 --> 01:41:13,171
I had gone to him.

1175
01:41:14,011 --> 01:41:14,886
Who is he?

1176
01:41:14,966 --> 01:41:18,171
I know. What did he tell you?

1177
01:41:19,251 --> 01:41:21,451
When Madhav gets
reborn, he'll meet you.

1178
01:41:22,151 --> 01:41:23,251
You met him?

1179
01:41:26,822 --> 01:41:27,851
Yes.

1180
01:41:29,114 --> 01:41:30,251
You met me.

1181
01:41:37,611 --> 01:41:38,811
I have complete faith.

1182
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:41,891
You are a doctor,
you won't believe it.

1183
01:41:42,371 --> 01:41:44,611
You are an advocate, perhaps 
you too won't believe it.

1184
01:41:44,983 --> 01:41:46,691
You both are
well-educated, right?

1185
01:41:47,253 --> 01:41:49,691
But I'm illiterate.
And I believe it completely.

1186
01:41:52,571 --> 01:42:00,091
Look, even if you have no faith, 
still come with me just once.

1187
01:42:03,971 --> 01:42:05,051
Right now.

1188
01:42:11,749 --> 01:42:12,691
One more question.

1189
01:42:14,646 --> 01:42:15,878
Who is the junior master?

1190
01:42:16,527 --> 01:42:17,531
Chaudhary Janak Singh.

1191
01:42:25,371 --> 01:42:26,451
No.

1192
01:42:30,171 --> 01:42:33,371
And this girl about whom
this question is being asked..

1193
01:42:33,769 --> 01:42:35,651
..her name starts with Cha.

1194
01:42:35,731 --> 01:42:36,811
Chandramukhi!

1195
01:42:37,531 --> 01:42:39,371
Those who ask the question..
their name..

1196
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:40,531
..will start with Ma and Sa.

1197
01:42:40,731 --> 01:42:41,811
Mohan, Satto.

1198
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:43,371
The one whose
name starts with Ma..

1199
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:46,623
..was Sa's brother
in the previous birth.

1200
01:42:49,921 --> 01:42:52,549
When this question is
asked the girl whose name..

1201
01:42:52,629 --> 01:42:54,451
..starts with Cha would
be in great turmoil.

1202
01:42:55,720 --> 01:43:01,039
Because she is the
same soul who is reborn..

1203
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:05,651
..who had name starting
with Pa in the previous birth.

1204
01:43:06,337 --> 01:43:07,775
Yes, Paro.

1205
01:43:11,251 --> 01:43:13,611
She was murdered
in the previous birth.

1206
01:43:16,171 --> 01:43:20,371
So, she will suffer
in this birth until..

1207
01:43:20,877 --> 01:43:24,952
..her murderer is punished.

1208
01:43:25,838 --> 01:43:28,152
Punishment.
- Priest.. - Not now.

1209
01:43:29,114 --> 01:43:31,396
The one who loved
her in the previous birth..

1210
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:34,250
..will get him punished
and whose name starts..

1211
01:43:35,352 --> 01:43:39,011
..with Ma in this birth.
- Mohan.

1212
01:43:39,374 --> 01:43:42,251
And one who is
connected with law.

1213
01:43:44,746 --> 01:43:45,721
He is an advocate.

1214
01:43:45,961 --> 01:43:47,201
Who will I get punished?

1215
01:43:48,184 --> 01:43:50,087
The destiny will
punish through you.

1216
01:43:50,167 --> 01:43:51,641
But who is to be punished?

1217
01:43:52,412 --> 01:43:54,241
Who murdered Paro?

1218
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:56,641
I'll read further.

1219
01:43:57,558 --> 01:44:01,441
Now it is being described as
to who carried out her murder.

1220
01:44:05,807 --> 01:44:07,281
The page is torn.

1221
01:44:12,721 --> 01:44:14,881
So how can I find out?

1222
01:44:15,201 --> 01:44:18,201
I can only read from the
book of Bhrigu Maharaj.

1223
01:44:18,641 --> 01:44:20,441
I can't tell you
anything more than this.

1224
01:44:37,472 --> 01:44:39,041
Can I call you Madhav?

1225
01:44:44,034 --> 01:44:45,041
Once?

1226
01:44:48,456 --> 01:44:52,441
Madhav! My brother.

1227
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:05,041
"The procession of
misery in my heart."

1228
01:45:05,641 --> 01:45:10,281
"The funeral pyre
of grief in my eyes."

1229
01:45:10,768 --> 01:45:14,761
"All the desire is
lost from the heart."

1230
01:45:15,721 --> 01:45:19,641
"The wind of grief is blowing."

1231
01:45:19,961 --> 01:45:29,521
"It sleeps comfortably
in the chest of storm."

1232
01:45:29,894 --> 01:45:34,488
"Every garland of the
happiness-sorrow."

1233
01:45:34,942 --> 01:45:39,441
"It is formed by the destiny."

1234
01:45:40,002 --> 01:45:44,801
"In the lines of the hands."

1235
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:49,521
"It wakes up and lies dormant."

1236
01:45:49,948 --> 01:45:54,121
"Every garland of the
happiness-sorrow."

1237
01:45:55,159 --> 01:45:59,281
"It is formed by the destiny."

1238
01:46:05,332 --> 01:46:07,169
Have you forgotten
even to greet me?

1239
01:46:12,662 --> 01:46:14,782
Don't live with an illusion
that Chaudhary Janak Singh..

1240
01:46:14,862 --> 01:46:16,782
..is standing before you
to complain about his..

1241
01:46:16,862 --> 01:46:19,235
..daughter's broken heart.

1242
01:46:21,862 --> 01:46:23,782
I'm only here to ask you
what do you want to say..

1243
01:46:23,862 --> 01:46:26,262
..about the drama that occurred
in the gathering that night.

1244
01:46:28,102 --> 01:46:29,182
Why don't you say anything?

1245
01:46:30,942 --> 01:46:32,022
I'm helpless.

1246
01:46:32,382 --> 01:46:34,782
The other name for
helplessness is cowardice.

1247
01:46:35,916 --> 01:46:38,862
One more name is silence.
So, I'm silent.

1248
01:46:39,246 --> 01:46:41,782
One mad girl has
blinded your eyes.

1249
01:46:45,495 --> 01:46:49,822
Let there be curtain on the
thing which is under cover.

1250
01:46:50,262 --> 01:46:52,622
This cover is not a coffin
which cannot be opened.

1251
01:46:54,582 --> 01:46:57,662
But I can see that you're
getting buried in madness.

1252
01:46:58,976 --> 01:47:00,862
You've made a very
big mistake, Mohan.

1253
01:47:01,528 --> 01:47:02,782
When you come back 
on the right path..

1254
01:47:02,862 --> 01:47:05,862
..that path will take
you straight to my doors.

1255
01:47:08,187 --> 01:47:11,862
But for the time being my
path goes out of this house.

1256
01:47:15,172 --> 01:47:17,582
If you need anything,
you can take it from here.

1257
01:47:18,782 --> 01:47:20,822
No request gets refused here.

1258
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:33,782
Naresh was saying it is
very necessary to find..

1259
01:47:33,862 --> 01:47:35,464
..the address of the mansion.

1260
01:47:35,862 --> 01:47:39,085
Now I've found you, why should
I bother about the mansion?

1261
01:47:40,275 --> 01:47:41,262
Try to remember.

1262
01:47:45,139 --> 01:47:46,182
I don't remember anything.

1263
01:47:49,377 --> 01:47:50,422
Let's go.

1264
01:48:15,782 --> 01:48:16,491
There!

1265
01:48:16,772 --> 01:48:18,022
What?

1266
01:48:19,842 --> 01:48:20,862
The mansion.

1267
01:48:35,334 --> 01:48:36,734
Is this the one? - Yes.

1268
01:48:37,875 --> 01:48:39,691
The bedroom was upstairs.

1269
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,934
On top of it was a store-room.

1270
01:48:43,734 --> 01:48:45,094
But that mansion was new.

1271
01:48:51,334 --> 01:48:52,814
Papa used to sit there.

1272
01:49:01,011 --> 01:49:03,534
Papa! Papa!

1273
01:49:06,871 --> 01:49:07,814
Who?

1274
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:09,014
Paro!

1275
01:49:09,654 --> 01:49:10,734
Paro?

1276
01:49:12,934 --> 01:49:15,390
Paro! - Papa.

1277
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:18,654
My daughter! Paro, I knew 
that you'd come one day.

1278
01:49:19,076 --> 01:49:20,254
One day you would
certainly come.

1279
01:49:20,334 --> 01:49:21,414
You have come.

1280
01:49:21,574 --> 01:49:24,734
People told me lies
that my daughter is dead.

1281
01:49:24,814 --> 01:49:27,334
No. - I had the faith 
that you'd be back.

1282
01:49:27,414 --> 01:49:28,395
You'd surely come.

1283
01:49:28,475 --> 01:49:30,534
Papa! I'm here.

1284
01:49:33,934 --> 01:49:35,014
Naresh!

1285
01:49:36,913 --> 01:49:38,881
Doctor is inside
checking up a patient.

1286
01:49:39,334 --> 01:49:40,934
I don't understand
what this matter is.

1287
01:49:46,934 --> 01:49:49,494
Where has she gone? Paro!

1288
01:49:49,574 --> 01:49:51,094
Listen! What do you do here?

1289
01:49:51,465 --> 01:49:53,574
I'm the gardener, sir.
But who are you?

1290
01:49:53,654 --> 01:49:54,734
Where is the girl who
had come here now?

1291
01:49:55,228 --> 01:49:56,734
I don't know I'm blind.

1292
01:49:56,814 --> 01:49:57,934
I'm asking you the same.

1293
01:49:58,014 --> 01:49:59,614
Mohan, you enquire with him, 
I'll go inside and see.

1294
01:50:00,168 --> 01:50:01,134
How is Paro related to you?

1295
01:50:01,214 --> 01:50:02,494
She is my daughter, sir.

1296
01:50:05,812 --> 01:50:06,814
Chandramukhi!

1297
01:50:12,734 --> 01:50:15,814
Chandramukhi!
What happened, Chandramukhi?

1298
01:50:17,334 --> 01:50:18,414
Chandramukhi!

1299
01:50:21,076 --> 01:50:23,152
Take me back home.

1300
01:50:25,254 --> 01:50:26,814
So you had lodged a report?
- Yes.

1301
01:50:27,357 --> 01:50:28,373
Date?

1302
01:50:28,453 --> 01:50:31,494
It was the monsoon season.
It was month of August.

1303
01:50:31,574 --> 01:50:32,734
Date was 20.

1304
01:50:32,934 --> 01:50:34,014
Which year?

1305
01:50:34,094 --> 01:50:35,174
1945.

1306
01:50:36,254 --> 01:50:40,654
1945.. Naresh!
Take Chandramukhi home.

1307
01:50:40,734 --> 01:50:41,814
I'll come there soon.

1308
01:50:43,022 --> 01:50:44,014
Sir.

1309
01:50:44,094 --> 01:50:46,294
Sir!
You should've called me, sir..

1310
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:48,459
Good morning, sir.

1311
01:50:48,539 --> 01:50:50,120
I want the register of 1945.
Quickly!

1312
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,254
I'm in a hurry. - Yes, sir.

1313
01:50:51,334 --> 01:50:52,168
Constable! - Yes, sir.

1314
01:50:52,248 --> 01:50:53,574
Take out the
register from inside.

1315
01:50:53,934 --> 01:50:55,014
Immediately.

1316
01:51:06,174 --> 01:51:10,214
42. 43. 44.

1317
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:12,574
45.

1318
01:51:22,934 --> 01:51:25,414
March! July!

1319
01:51:25,494 --> 01:51:26,814
They all look torn, sir.

1320
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:28,094
August!

1321
01:51:29,254 --> 01:51:30,334
10th August.

1322
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:35,014
12.. 20 August.

1323
01:51:35,654 --> 01:51:37,734
This is the report 
which I wanted. The same.

1324
01:51:38,502 --> 01:51:40,934
But only thing written
is that Paro is missing.

1325
01:51:43,843 --> 01:51:44,814
The search is going on.

1326
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,254
The enquiry and
search is going on.

1327
01:51:49,323 --> 01:51:51,626
The search is stopped.
The case is closed.

1328
01:51:52,015 --> 01:51:53,014
No reason is given.

1329
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,398
Signed by Jagatram.
Where can I meet him?

1330
01:51:55,478 --> 01:51:57,200
This constable is
from British times.

1331
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:58,440
Perhaps he would know.

1332
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,360
Bholaram! Come here.

1333
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:07,560
Do you remember Jagatram
working here in 1945?

1334
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:11,720
Yes, now I remember.
He had begun to drink a lot.

1335
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:13,760
He also used to
come on duty drunk.

1336
01:52:14,025 --> 01:52:15,160
So the government 
dismissed him.

1337
01:52:16,036 --> 01:52:17,200
Where can I find him?

1338
01:52:17,603 --> 01:52:18,920
He was from village Badhai.

1339
01:52:19,127 --> 01:52:20,120
Perhaps you'll find him there.

1340
01:52:20,846 --> 01:52:22,280
May I help you, sir?

1341
01:52:25,462 --> 01:52:27,160
Can you tell me where 
is Jagatram's house? - Who?

1342
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:28,370
The one who was in
the police department?

1343
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:29,559
Jagat? - Yes.

1344
01:52:29,639 --> 01:52:30,920
I'll show you.

1345
01:52:32,889 --> 01:52:34,262
He stays in that small house.

1346
01:52:34,342 --> 01:52:35,520
Okay.

1347
01:52:45,678 --> 01:52:46,920
Are you Jagatram?

1348
01:52:48,586 --> 01:52:50,200
This is Jagatram.

1349
01:52:56,230 --> 01:52:58,440
Advocate! 
Do you recognize me?

1350
01:52:58,520 --> 01:52:59,840
Greetings.

1351
01:53:00,014 --> 01:53:01,200
Jagatram! - Yes.

1352
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,280
I want to ask you
about certain things.

1353
01:53:04,197 --> 01:53:07,200
Sir, my mouth is dry.
How can I talk?

1354
01:53:08,014 --> 01:53:09,720
Will you have a drink? - No.

1355
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:12,360
But you can give me a drink.
It is the same thing.

1356
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:13,720
The shop is apposite here.

1357
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:15,360
Please come soon.

1358
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,920
Advocate is a nice person.
He'll bring 2-3 bottles.

1359
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:22,239
I'll drink 2 bottles.
And I'll talk.

1360
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:27,000
Give me two bottles.
- Which brand?

1361
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,200
Any.

1362
01:53:28,432 --> 01:53:29,360
Quickly.

1363
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:32,000
Take the change.

1364
01:53:37,156 --> 01:53:38,540
Now you can talk to me.

1365
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:43,270
Jagat.. - Wait.

1366
01:53:44,390 --> 01:53:45,470
Wait.

1367
01:53:47,329 --> 01:53:48,853
Let me light a lamp first.

1368
01:53:50,190 --> 01:53:53,110
The matter is about
long time back.

1369
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:54,270
How long?

1370
01:53:55,719 --> 01:53:58,710
I mean to say it
is very old matter.

1371
01:53:59,123 --> 01:54:00,269
Old matter? - Yes.

1372
01:54:00,496 --> 01:54:01,270
Wait.

1373
01:54:01,762 --> 01:54:03,903
Wait, I'll listen now. - Why?

1374
01:54:08,281 --> 01:54:13,103
When I drink, all the old
matters come before me.

1375
01:54:13,405 --> 01:54:18,389
When I drink my past
life comes before me.

1376
01:54:18,691 --> 01:54:20,970
You turned out to
be better than me.

1377
01:54:21,945 --> 01:54:23,970
Drink some more.

1378
01:54:27,059 --> 01:54:29,210
The past life has
is present here now.

1379
01:54:34,086 --> 01:54:35,130
Jagat! - Yes.

1380
01:54:36,357 --> 01:54:37,850
I'm Madhav.

1381
01:54:38,130 --> 01:54:39,210
Oh!

1382
01:54:41,697 --> 01:54:42,730
Madhav!

1383
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:44,130
Madhav?

1384
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:47,650
Oh, you are Madhav? - Madhav.

1385
01:54:49,903 --> 01:54:51,210
You are Madhav? - Madhav!

1386
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:55,233
So strange. Wait.

1387
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:09,650
Yes, Madhav!

1388
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:11,850
Jagat! - So you're here?

1389
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:13,650
Jagat, do you recognize me?

1390
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:15,210
I didn't recognize you.

1391
01:55:15,472 --> 01:55:18,890
First put this inside
or I'll lock you up.

1392
01:55:18,970 --> 01:55:20,450
Put it inside? Here.

1393
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:22,170
Are you enjoying it?

1394
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:24,530
Paro!

1395
01:55:25,450 --> 01:55:29,290
Paro? - Hey, do you love her?

1396
01:55:30,023 --> 01:55:32,650
She is in the control
of junior master.

1397
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:34,250
No. - Yes.

1398
01:55:35,136 --> 01:55:35,936
This is a lie.

1399
01:55:36,016 --> 01:55:37,290
It is not a lie.
- Where is Paro?

1400
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:39,370
She is.. - Dead?

1401
01:55:39,450 --> 01:55:40,530
Dead.

1402
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:42,650
She is dead. 
- Yes, she is dead.

1403
01:55:43,907 --> 01:55:44,987
How did she die?

1404
01:55:45,547 --> 01:55:47,747
She was murdered.

1405
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:50,147
Who murdered her? Who?

1406
01:55:50,866 --> 01:55:52,307
Him. - Who?

1407
01:55:52,387 --> 01:55:53,467
Junior master.

1408
01:55:53,687 --> 01:55:54,747
Junior master?

1409
01:55:55,968 --> 01:55:57,307
Drink it.

1410
01:55:59,979 --> 01:56:01,827
How do you know?

1411
01:56:02,045 --> 01:56:03,467
I know it well.

1412
01:56:03,894 --> 01:56:04,827
Evidence!

1413
01:56:04,907 --> 01:56:07,467
I've the evidence too.
I'm not telling any lies.

1414
01:56:07,688 --> 01:56:08,627
I've the evidence.

1415
01:56:08,974 --> 01:56:09,907
If you have the
evidence, tell me.

1416
01:56:09,987 --> 01:56:12,627
I'll show you right now.
- Yes, show me.

1417
01:56:13,288 --> 01:56:14,547
Hold me. I'm falling.

1418
01:56:14,627 --> 01:56:16,507
Why did you stop
the police enquiry?

1419
01:56:16,942 --> 01:56:17,907
I'll show you.

1420
01:56:17,987 --> 01:56:20,387
Had you taken a bribe?
Had you taken a bribe?

1421
01:56:20,467 --> 01:56:21,547
I had.

1422
01:56:21,926 --> 01:56:22,827
Where is it?

1423
01:56:22,907 --> 01:56:23,987
What did you find
in the mansion?

1424
01:56:24,787 --> 01:56:26,827
What did you find?
- I'll tell you soon.

1425
01:56:26,907 --> 01:56:28,747
Here. This thing.

1426
01:56:36,467 --> 01:56:38,747
Madhav! Paro!

1427
01:56:40,553 --> 01:56:43,187
Madhav! Madhav!

1428
01:56:49,829 --> 01:56:51,747
If you have got the evidence
and Paro was murdered..

1429
01:56:51,827 --> 01:56:54,121
..by Chaudhary Janak
Singh, then you must..

1430
01:56:54,446 --> 01:56:56,067
..file a murder
case against him.

1431
01:56:56,147 --> 01:56:57,224
I can't do it.

1432
01:56:58,047 --> 01:56:59,487
It is your duty.

1433
01:56:59,567 --> 01:57:02,447
I know what my duty is and I
also know that case should be filed.

1434
01:57:02,527 --> 01:57:03,607
But I can't do it.

1435
01:57:07,127 --> 01:57:08,607
Shouldn't he get the
punishment for the murder?

1436
01:57:09,887 --> 01:57:11,687
My life is burdened under
the favours done by him.

1437
01:57:12,087 --> 01:57:14,381
He raised me, educated
me, made me an advocate..

1438
01:57:14,556 --> 01:57:15,636
He made me the
public prosecutor.

1439
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,276
He was ready to marry
his daughter to me.

1440
01:57:17,356 --> 01:57:18,216
But I couldn't accept her.

1441
01:57:18,296 --> 01:57:19,622
I should file a case
against such a person?

1442
01:57:19,702 --> 01:57:20,865
You are the public prosecutor.

1443
01:57:20,945 --> 01:57:22,396
But I'm also a human being.

1444
01:57:25,196 --> 01:57:26,556
I've a heart I'm my chest.

1445
01:57:26,821 --> 01:57:28,236
There is something
called loyalty.

1446
01:57:28,396 --> 01:57:29,476
Should I forget shame,
honor, respect and loyalty..

1447
01:57:29,556 --> 01:57:30,636
..all these things?

1448
01:57:30,919 --> 01:57:32,316
Should I be betrayer? 
A traitor?

1449
01:57:35,925 --> 01:57:37,396
Then where can 
I hide my face?

1450
01:57:39,481 --> 01:57:40,756
What respect 
I'll be left with?

1451
01:57:43,836 --> 01:57:44,916
Mohan!

1452
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:49,756
Mohan, I love
Chandramukhi so much..

1453
01:57:50,519 --> 01:57:53,416
..that even if I've to
give my life for her sake..

1454
01:57:53,589 --> 01:57:54,636
..I'll sacrifice it at once.

1455
01:57:55,436 --> 01:57:57,946
It is my misfortune
that she loves you.

1456
01:57:58,390 --> 01:58:01,756
And it is her misfortune
that you love only your honor.

1457
01:58:42,889 --> 01:58:46,369
Come, my boy. It's good 
that you have returned.

1458
01:58:50,531 --> 01:58:53,169
Well, who doesn't commit
mistakes in young age?

1459
01:58:53,489 --> 01:58:55,929
What's the big deal
if you committed it?

1460
01:59:00,725 --> 01:59:02,804
I am sure that Karuna
will forgive you..

1461
01:59:04,004 --> 01:59:05,764
..and she will accept you.

1462
01:59:08,077 --> 01:59:10,724
I am also aware that
you're feeling very shameful..

1463
01:59:10,804 --> 01:59:12,204
..but cannot 
put it into words.

1464
01:59:14,866 --> 01:59:15,884
Won't you have a seat?

1465
01:59:26,284 --> 01:59:27,364
Bless you.

1466
01:59:28,524 --> 01:59:30,724
Whatever I have achieved
is because of your help.

1467
01:59:31,731 --> 01:59:32,764
I am grateful.

1468
01:59:35,018 --> 01:59:36,404
So, I touched your feet.

1469
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:40,244
I know that you
are not ungrateful.

1470
01:59:40,704 --> 01:59:42,844
I have forgotten
whatever you have done.

1471
01:59:43,524 --> 01:59:47,244
Have you also forgotten what
had happened 30 years ago?

1472
01:59:50,844 --> 01:59:55,324
Paro, an innocent 
village girl.

1473
01:59:56,413 --> 01:59:57,444
Have you forgotten?

1474
02:00:01,644 --> 02:00:03,724
Have you forgotten
that you had raped her?

1475
02:00:04,845 --> 02:00:06,084
Who has misinformed you?

1476
02:00:06,644 --> 02:00:10,524
Have you forgotten
that you murdered her?

1477
02:00:10,644 --> 02:00:12,819
Out of respect for you,
I am keeping quiet..

1478
02:00:12,899 --> 02:00:14,764
..but you keep 
talking nonsense!

1479
02:00:15,028 --> 02:00:17,724
A case for murder is
being filed against you.

1480
02:00:19,072 --> 02:00:21,044
A case for murder?

1481
02:00:21,957 --> 02:00:23,764
Against Chaudhary Janak Singh?

1482
02:00:24,984 --> 02:00:26,524
Who will file it?

1483
02:00:28,508 --> 02:00:29,764
Public prosecutor.

1484
02:00:46,745 --> 02:00:51,724
I cannot forget a favor, I will
not forget an insult as well.

1485
02:00:52,124 --> 02:00:56,044
You! Ungrateful!
- It is not advisable..

1486
02:00:56,124 --> 02:01:02,084
..to raise a hand on the public
prosecutor, Mr. Chaudhary.

1487
02:01:03,244 --> 02:01:04,924
You scoundrel!

1488
02:01:05,524 --> 02:01:08,876
You survived on my crumbs
and now you accuse me!

1489
02:01:09,044 --> 02:01:09,957
Papa, what happened?

1490
02:01:10,037 --> 02:01:12,084
He had come to
falsely accuse me.

1491
02:01:14,164 --> 02:01:22,284
And then, Your Honour, just like
a falcon overpowers a sparrow..

1492
02:01:22,844 --> 02:01:26,044
..in the same manner, the
accused overpowered the daughter..

1493
02:01:26,124 --> 02:01:29,724
..of his gardener, and
satiated his lust with her body.

1494
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:31,884
He raped the innocent girl.

1495
02:01:32,541 --> 02:01:35,958
And when Paro became
pregnant, the accused..

1496
02:01:36,325 --> 02:01:41,017
..arrogant with his youth, the
spoiled son of a rich father..

1497
02:01:41,097 --> 02:01:45,084
..committed another
crime to hide the first crime..

1498
02:01:46,011 --> 02:01:48,724
..and he murdered his
gardener's daughter.

1499
02:01:49,189 --> 02:01:51,444
Her dead body was
disposed off so cleverly..

1500
02:01:51,730 --> 02:01:54,724
..that for years, the
crime never came to light.

1501
02:01:58,077 --> 02:02:01,444
Your Honour, today I
will expose that secret..

1502
02:02:01,730 --> 02:02:06,484
..and present the crime like
a fresh wound to the court.

1503
02:02:08,714 --> 02:02:12,444
I know very well that
the accused person..

1504
02:02:12,703 --> 02:02:14,238
..is as very prominent
man of this city.

1505
02:02:14,318 --> 02:02:17,964
But, the law considers
the crime and not the man.

1506
02:02:18,484 --> 02:02:20,924
Before it, the king and the
pauper, the rich and the poor..

1507
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:22,964
..the boss and the
servant are equal.

1508
02:02:25,005 --> 02:02:28,124
The crime is serious, the
punishment is also severe.

1509
02:02:29,254 --> 02:02:32,284
The crime is murder,
the punishment is death.

1510
02:02:33,568 --> 02:02:35,724
The law happens to
be devoid of mercy..

1511
02:02:35,957 --> 02:02:38,204
..therefore there is
no scope for mercy.

1512
02:02:39,481 --> 02:02:40,627
Thank you, your Honour.

1513
02:02:43,048 --> 02:02:45,405
If a criminal wants to say something
he is given chance to speak.

1514
02:02:46,053 --> 02:02:50,875
Your Honour whom we
thought to be our son..

1515
02:02:50,955 --> 02:02:53,870
..if he wants to give
me death sentence..

1516
02:02:54,821 --> 02:02:58,410
..I've no other option
but to remain quiet.

1517
02:03:01,859 --> 02:03:04,289
Is there a lawyer to
defend the accused?

1518
02:03:11,476 --> 02:03:15,476
Mother, I will bring back
papa honorably discharged.

1519
02:03:16,227 --> 02:03:17,636
I take that oath.

1520
02:03:19,476 --> 02:03:21,547
Place your hand on the Holy
Bible and swear to tell the truth.

1521
02:03:21,627 --> 02:03:23,756
I will tell the truth and
nothing but the truth.

1522
02:03:24,358 --> 02:03:25,476
Your name?

1523
02:03:25,556 --> 02:03:26,931
Tom. S. Walters.

1524
02:03:27,011 --> 02:03:29,156
Profession?
- Retired Major, Indian Army.

1525
02:03:39,027 --> 02:03:42,476
Major Tom Walters, do
you know this painting?

1526
02:03:42,725 --> 02:03:45,996
Yes, I had made this painting.
It has been about 30-35 years.

1527
02:03:46,756 --> 02:03:47,836
Who is it?

1528
02:03:47,916 --> 02:03:53,469
I had a servant, his name 
was Madhav.. my God!

1529
02:03:53,696 --> 02:03:55,876
Answer my question, who is it?

1530
02:03:56,139 --> 02:03:59,476
He had a fiancée.
This is her painting.

1531
02:03:59,761 --> 02:04:01,328
Do you remember her name?

1532
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:04,276
Her name was.. Paro.

1533
02:04:04,464 --> 02:04:08,116
I have no further questions.
You may question him if you wish.

1534
02:04:08,356 --> 02:04:10,276
Your Honor, I have no questions.

1535
02:04:11,243 --> 02:04:13,016
Surprising!
She didn't ask him anything!

1536
02:04:13,096 --> 02:04:15,027
It's surprising.
- I too am surprised.

1537
02:04:15,107 --> 02:04:16,994
There has to be a 
cross-examination. - Yes.

1538
02:04:17,074 --> 02:04:19,196
Do you recognize the
necklace in this painting?

1539
02:04:21,516 --> 02:04:24,636
My brother Madhav had
gifted this necklace to Paro.

1540
02:04:37,196 --> 02:04:38,276
Is this the same necklace?

1541
02:04:39,762 --> 02:04:42,156
Yes, it is the same necklace.

1542
02:04:42,876 --> 02:04:44,196
Paro-Madhav is written on it.

1543
02:04:45,881 --> 02:04:48,556
Your Honour, look, the
necklace in the painting..

1544
02:04:48,636 --> 02:04:50,476
..and this one are the same.

1545
02:05:03,038 --> 02:05:04,036
Exactly the same.

1546
02:05:05,038 --> 02:05:06,556
No further questions.

1547
02:05:07,006 --> 02:05:07,916
Your witness.

1548
02:05:09,233 --> 02:05:10,476
No questions.

1549
02:05:10,768 --> 02:05:12,476
The second witness
was also not questioned.

1550
02:05:12,556 --> 02:05:15,076
Consider Chaudhary Janak 
Singh as gone. - Right.

1551
02:05:15,407 --> 02:05:18,036
What was your daughter doing
when you saw her for the last time?

1552
02:05:18,325 --> 02:05:20,196
She had gone to the mansion.

1553
02:05:21,017 --> 02:05:22,476
Who else was in the
mansion at that time?

1554
02:05:23,169 --> 02:05:25,876
The senior master
and the junior master.

1555
02:05:26,218 --> 02:05:27,156
Where was the senior master?

1556
02:05:27,742 --> 02:05:30,876
He was downstairs in
the glass covered veranda.

1557
02:05:31,115 --> 02:05:32,076
And the junior master?

1558
02:05:33,137 --> 02:05:35,596
He must be somewhere
inside, how would I know?

1559
02:05:36,099 --> 02:05:36,956
Then what happened?

1560
02:05:37,036 --> 02:05:40,396
Then.. then the junior master took
the senior master in a rickshaw..

1561
02:05:40,476 --> 02:05:43,276
..to the bus station.

1562
02:05:43,807 --> 02:05:44,636
Did Paro come out?

1563
02:05:45,331 --> 02:05:46,676
Paro did not come.

1564
02:05:47,612 --> 02:05:49,596
You must have filed a
report at the police station.

1565
02:05:50,575 --> 02:05:51,516
Yes.

1566
02:05:57,980 --> 02:06:01,556
Your Honour, this is the complaint 
book of the police station.

1567
02:06:02,877 --> 02:06:05,756
1945 AD, when everything
used to be written in Urdu.

1568
02:06:06,661 --> 02:06:08,276
The complaint was
registered on 20th August.

1569
02:06:09,072 --> 02:06:12,476
For many days, it was reported
that the investigation is going on.

1570
02:06:12,812 --> 02:06:14,476
All of a sudden, the
investigation was stopped.

1571
02:06:15,758 --> 02:06:17,958
Signature is of
sub-inspector Jagatram.

1572
02:06:18,438 --> 02:06:20,038
Your Honour, why was
the investigation stopped?

1573
02:06:20,118 --> 02:06:23,438
There is a secret, which
will be revealed to the court.

1574
02:06:23,638 --> 02:06:27,358
No, Jagdu, today I have
come to ask you for something.

1575
02:06:27,438 --> 02:06:31,638
Satto, what do I
have except this junk?

1576
02:06:32,038 --> 02:06:33,960
You have broken your
oath to come here..

1577
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:37,358
..and I swear that
whatever I have is yours.

1578
02:06:38,295 --> 02:06:39,918
Firstly, give up alcohol.

1579
02:06:41,638 --> 02:06:45,838
Okay. - And secondly,
the paper of police report..

1580
02:06:45,998 --> 02:06:47,198
It is there, it is there.

1581
02:06:47,558 --> 02:06:49,678
It is there.
- Present it to the court.

1582
02:06:49,758 --> 02:06:52,638
At which court?
I will do as you say.

1583
02:06:52,718 --> 02:06:53,798
I will tell you everything.

1584
02:06:54,158 --> 02:06:55,638
But Jagdu, give me one promise.

1585
02:06:55,758 --> 02:07:01,038
I spent my whole life in your
memory, what more do you want?

1586
02:07:01,118 --> 02:07:02,358
What more do you want?

1587
02:07:02,438 --> 02:07:07,758
Jagdu, I.. I will never 
forget this favour. Never.

1588
02:07:07,838 --> 02:07:13,158
This is the report which I had
written after searching the mansion.

1589
02:07:13,387 --> 02:07:16,638
It has the signature
of junior sir.

1590
02:07:16,998 --> 02:07:21,238
I had torn it from the report
book and kept it with me.

1591
02:07:31,758 --> 02:07:34,118
Place your hand on Gita (Holy Book) 
and swear to tell the truth.

1592
02:07:34,438 --> 02:07:35,558
I swear on the Gita
that I will tell the truth..

1593
02:07:35,638 --> 02:07:37,358
..and nothing but the truth.

1594
02:07:38,198 --> 02:07:41,085
Name? - Jagdu..
no, no, Jagatram.

1595
02:07:41,165 --> 02:07:45,638
Profession? - Guard at the orchard.
- Whose orchard?

1596
02:07:46,558 --> 02:07:48,638
Of Chaudhary Janak Singh.

1597
02:07:50,513 --> 02:07:51,878
What were you doing earlier?

1598
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:56,638
Earlier?
You are a policeman, right?

1599
02:07:57,497 --> 02:07:58,758
I was in the police force.

1600
02:08:00,384 --> 02:08:01,358
Order!

1601
02:08:02,178 --> 02:08:04,924
Jagatram, when you were in
the police force did you ever write..

1602
02:08:05,108 --> 02:08:07,638
..a missing person's report
about a girl named Paro?

1603
02:08:08,114 --> 02:08:13,438
Report? Yes, I had written it.

1604
02:08:13,747 --> 02:08:17,358
During the investigation, did you
search the house of Mr. Chaudhary?

1605
02:08:20,623 --> 02:08:21,678
I did.

1606
02:08:22,309 --> 02:08:23,278
What did you find?

1607
02:08:23,823 --> 02:08:24,878
A necklace.

1608
02:08:28,472 --> 02:08:29,718
Is this the same necklace?

1609
02:08:31,521 --> 02:08:36,638
Yes. Yes, it is.
It is the same one.

1610
02:08:40,970 --> 02:08:43,068
From the daily report of
the police, it seems that..

1611
02:08:43,148 --> 02:08:44,638
..you suddenly stopped
the investigation..

1612
02:08:44,718 --> 02:08:45,918
..about Paro's missing.

1613
02:08:47,068 --> 02:08:48,278
Jagatram, why did you do that?

1614
02:08:50,127 --> 02:08:51,638
Why did you stop
the investigation?

1615
02:08:54,950 --> 02:08:58,638
Your Honour, the witness
is drunk, I apologize for that.

1616
02:08:59,144 --> 02:09:01,464
I request to the court that he
should be called again tomorrow..

1617
02:09:01,544 --> 02:09:03,678
..because he is a very
important and crucial witness.

1618
02:09:04,290 --> 02:09:06,358
And I take full responsibility
for his remaining sober.

1619
02:09:07,371 --> 02:09:09,771
Your Honour, I want to have a
chance to question the witness.

1620
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:11,398
But the witness is drunk.

1621
02:09:11,749 --> 02:09:14,078
I have a doubt that
this man is faking it.

1622
02:09:18,063 --> 02:09:20,318
Your Honour, the witness
does not smell of alcohol.

1623
02:09:20,971 --> 02:09:23,252
A charade is being played,
because the witness..

1624
02:09:23,792 --> 02:09:26,665
..is not answering the way
the public prosecutor wants.

1625
02:09:26,745 --> 02:09:28,638
But I find him totally drunk.

1626
02:09:28,831 --> 02:09:30,918
You can ask questions if
the witness is not drunk.

1627
02:09:31,425 --> 02:09:32,278
Thank you, Your Honour.

1628
02:09:35,479 --> 02:09:39,090
Jagatram!
Are you listening, Jagatram?

1629
02:09:41,442 --> 02:09:43,402
Were you sacked
from the police force?

1630
02:09:45,962 --> 02:09:49,442
Yes, madam.

1631
02:09:49,771 --> 02:09:51,082
Why were you sacked?

1632
02:09:51,882 --> 02:09:54,962
What do I say? Alcohol..

1633
02:09:55,042 --> 02:09:57,002
Because you used
to remain drunk?

1634
02:10:01,402 --> 02:10:02,522
What rubbish!

1635
02:10:02,701 --> 02:10:04,642
Jagatram, you are not drunk!

1636
02:10:06,082 --> 02:10:11,442
Today I didn't drink
alcohol, I drank poison.

1637
02:10:15,761 --> 02:10:17,002
Order!

1638
02:10:25,706 --> 02:10:27,082
There is no pulse, sir.

1639
02:10:32,689 --> 02:10:38,362
Due to this sad incident, the
court is adjourned till tomorrow.

1640
02:10:41,565 --> 02:10:42,962
The wretched man
had to die today!

1641
02:10:43,522 --> 02:10:45,122
The whole case has
been turned around.

1642
02:10:47,716 --> 02:10:49,642
What is written in the note
that he had handed to you?

1643
02:10:52,387 --> 02:10:55,122
I had promised to come to
the court, so I have come.

1644
02:10:55,882 --> 02:10:59,762
But how can I betray the
one who has supported me?

1645
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:03,162
I had promised that I will not
drink, so I did not drink today.

1646
02:11:03,942 --> 02:11:05,602
I have come to see
you for the last time.

1647
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:08,002
I have torn up the evidence.

1648
02:11:08,677 --> 02:11:09,962
Forgive me, Satto.

1649
02:11:10,442 --> 02:11:14,396
Your Honour, due to the death
of the prosecution witness..

1650
02:11:15,013 --> 02:11:16,682
..his testimony could
not be recorded.

1651
02:11:17,122 --> 02:11:19,242
Therefore, I should
be granted some time..

1652
02:11:19,322 --> 02:11:23,164
..to gather evidence
and find witnesses.

1653
02:11:23,244 --> 02:11:26,882
Your Honour, instead of granting
more time to the public prosecutor..

1654
02:11:27,109 --> 02:11:29,322
..I should be given a chance
to present my witnesses.

1655
02:11:29,442 --> 02:11:30,731
Are your witnesses present?

1656
02:11:30,811 --> 02:11:32,720
They certainly are, 
Your Honour.

1657
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,042
Call them.

1658
02:11:34,122 --> 02:11:37,337
My first witness is,
Mr. Mohan Kapoor.

1659
02:11:38,645 --> 02:11:39,962
Do you mean the
public prosecutor?

1660
02:11:40,482 --> 02:11:41,602
Yes, Your Honour.

1661
02:11:41,682 --> 02:11:42,962
Your Honour, this
cannot be done!

1662
02:11:43,082 --> 02:11:44,537
This is a very strange request.

1663
02:11:44,617 --> 02:11:46,362
But it is not against the law.

1664
02:11:46,482 --> 02:11:48,402
I strongly protest
against her request!

1665
02:11:50,278 --> 02:11:54,202
The court would like to know if
this is crucial for the proceedings.

1666
02:11:54,282 --> 02:11:56,962
It is very crucial, Your
Honour, I assure you.

1667
02:11:59,762 --> 02:12:01,882
The court instructs
the public prosecutor..

1668
02:12:02,894 --> 02:12:04,762
..to take the witness stand.

1669
02:12:18,098 --> 02:12:20,458
Place your hand on Gita
and swear to tell the truth.

1670
02:12:21,978 --> 02:12:23,578
I will tell the truth and
nothing about the truth.

1671
02:12:24,698 --> 02:12:27,058
Did you go to meet the
priest of the Hanuman temple?

1672
02:12:29,131 --> 02:12:30,093
I did.

1673
02:12:30,173 --> 02:12:31,818
Did you go to inquire about
Chandramukhi's past birth..

1674
02:12:31,898 --> 02:12:33,303
..through Bhrigu Scrolls?

1675
02:12:35,412 --> 02:12:37,159
Yes. - What did you find there?

1676
02:12:37,239 --> 02:12:38,785
Your Honour, this is
a totally private matter!

1677
02:12:40,288 --> 02:12:42,458
Is your question
connected with the case?

1678
02:12:42,807 --> 02:12:44,698
A strange connection,
Your Honour.

1679
02:12:44,969 --> 02:12:47,282
A close connection, a
dangerous connection!

1680
02:12:47,844 --> 02:12:51,002
In fact, this case is
connected with this matter.

1681
02:12:55,498 --> 02:12:56,698
Permission granted.

1682
02:12:57,347 --> 02:12:58,338
Thank you, Your Honour.

1683
02:13:00,126 --> 02:13:01,715
I am waiting for an answer.

1684
02:13:02,602 --> 02:13:04,537
What did you find out
through the Bhrigu Scrolls?

1685
02:13:07,088 --> 02:13:08,662
I will change the question.

1686
02:13:10,202 --> 02:13:12,559
What did you find out
about the past birth?

1687
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:14,142
I seek permission to come
out of the witness stand..

1688
02:13:14,222 --> 02:13:15,462
..and say something!
- You will stand there..

1689
02:13:15,542 --> 02:13:17,662
..until I give you
permission to come down!

1690
02:13:17,862 --> 02:13:19,258
I warn you to bring
up only those issues..

1691
02:13:19,338 --> 02:13:21,342
..which are connected
with the case.

1692
02:13:22,105 --> 02:13:24,142
I will be very
careful, Your Honor.

1693
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,262
I will again change
the question.

1694
02:13:29,565 --> 02:13:32,702
Did Bhrigu say that Paro has
been reborn as Chandramukhi?

1695
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:37,367
And that Saraswati's brother
Madhav has been born..

1696
02:13:37,447 --> 02:13:39,822
..as the present Mohan Kapoor?

1697
02:13:40,009 --> 02:13:41,662
Your Honour, I will again
request that this question is..

1698
02:13:41,742 --> 02:13:43,458
Is it true? Yes or no?

1699
02:13:45,782 --> 02:13:46,702
Yes.

1700
02:13:47,182 --> 02:13:50,262
Did Bhrigu reveal that
Madhav loved Paro?

1701
02:13:51,706 --> 02:13:54,242
And that Madhav will have
to be born as Mohan Kapoor..

1702
02:13:54,322 --> 02:13:58,372
..and avenge Paro's death
or else Chandramukhi's soul..

1703
02:13:58,452 --> 02:14:00,902
..will never find
peace in this birth?

1704
02:14:05,022 --> 02:14:08,275
Was it also written in the Bhrigu
Scrolls that Chaudhary Janak Singh..

1705
02:14:08,355 --> 02:14:09,622
..has murdered Paro?

1706
02:14:10,782 --> 02:14:11,577
I don't know.

1707
02:14:11,657 --> 02:14:13,942
Was it written or not?
Yes or no?

1708
02:14:15,582 --> 02:14:16,702
That page was torn.

1709
02:14:17,469 --> 02:14:18,862
You may go.

1710
02:14:23,695 --> 02:14:25,262
So, this is the
situation, Your Honour.

1711
02:14:25,512 --> 02:14:28,226
This case has been
filed based on past birth..

1712
02:14:28,550 --> 02:14:30,254
..and it should be
dismissed immediately..

1713
02:14:30,334 --> 02:14:33,022
..because nowhere is it written
in the law that there is past birth.

1714
02:14:33,142 --> 02:14:35,502
It is also not written in the
law that there is no past birth!

1715
02:14:36,366 --> 02:14:38,022
The law is silent
on this matter.

1716
02:14:38,257 --> 02:14:40,262
Silence cannot
be taken as denial.

1717
02:14:41,944 --> 02:14:43,502
The matter is very complicated.

1718
02:14:43,933 --> 02:14:46,142
Let me remind you, Your
Honour, that in this court..

1719
02:14:46,222 --> 02:14:47,582
..I was put under oath of Gita.

1720
02:14:47,987 --> 02:14:50,142
And a man who takes oath
on Gita, swears by rebirth..

1721
02:14:50,222 --> 02:14:52,782
..because the Lord
has said so in Gita.

1722
02:14:53,046 --> 02:14:59,222
If the court accepts the oath on
Gita then it also accepts rebirth!

1723
02:15:01,187 --> 02:15:04,420
If the court accepts the
vow taken on holy Gita..

1724
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:07,299
..then it accepts re-birth too.

1725
02:15:07,479 --> 02:15:10,235
But, Your Honour..the argument 
is not about rebirth..

1726
02:15:10,841 --> 02:15:12,387
..but in fact it is about
whether the case will proceed..

1727
02:15:12,603 --> 02:15:14,100
..based on the
incident of past birth..

1728
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:16,700
..or according to the
currently prevailing law?

1729
02:15:16,938 --> 02:15:19,367
Will the dead body of Paro,
who died 30 years ago..

1730
02:15:19,447 --> 02:15:22,009
..come to the court
and say who killed her?

1731
02:15:22,089 --> 02:15:23,511
Why would the dead
body come, Your Honour..

1732
02:15:23,591 --> 02:15:25,620
..when the message of her
soul has already reached us?

1733
02:15:25,820 --> 02:15:27,220
In the form of Chandramukhi?
- Yes!

1734
02:15:27,457 --> 02:15:31,300
Then, Your Honour, let 
Chandramukhi be presented as witness.

1735
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:32,500
No, Your Honour!

1736
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:33,660
Chandramukhi's condition 
is not fit enough..

1737
02:15:33,740 --> 02:15:34,820
..to present her in the court!

1738
02:15:35,003 --> 02:15:37,540
Does she have fever? - No.

1739
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:40,100
Is she physically 
handicapped? - No!

1740
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:42,100
Is she so delicate
that the atmosphere of..

1741
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:43,580
..the court will hurt her?

1742
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:45,540
No! - So why can't she come?

1743
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:47,100
No, no, Your Honor!
According to the doctor..

1744
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:48,420
..her mental condition
is very delicate!

1745
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:51,220
Your Honour, I want to call
her here to prove that only.

1746
02:15:51,716 --> 02:15:55,140
I consider Chandramukhi's
testimony very important.

1747
02:15:55,683 --> 02:15:58,540
If some secrets can be
revealed through Chandramukhi..

1748
02:16:00,083 --> 02:16:01,700
..then issue summons to her.

1749
02:16:01,820 --> 02:16:04,980
I had told you! I had told you not to
present Chandramukhi in the court!

1750
02:16:05,435 --> 02:16:06,380
The matter was not
under my control.

1751
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:07,540
You know very well
that Chandramukhi's..

1752
02:16:07,620 --> 02:16:08,700
..condition is not good!

1753
02:16:16,571 --> 02:16:19,220
Chandramukhi, 
don't feel scared.

1754
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:27,220
I have heard that you remember
things from your past birth.

1755
02:16:27,705 --> 02:16:29,540
Is it true?

1756
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:34,460
Sometimes I remember,
and sometimes I don't.

1757
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:37,100
Because of this, has
it ever happened that..

1758
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:40,620
..someone has thought
that you are insane?

1759
02:16:41,445 --> 02:16:42,980
Mummy and daddy think so.

1760
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:48,100
Chandramukhi, do you know
that in the jungle near Shimla..

1761
02:16:48,180 --> 02:16:50,100
..there is a big tree, on
which the names of Paro..

1762
02:16:50,180 --> 02:16:51,420
..and Madhav have been carved?

1763
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:52,387
Yes.

1764
02:16:52,467 --> 02:16:54,140
And that they were lovers?
- Yes.

1765
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:56,100
And currently also lovers
go there and pray that..

1766
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:59,460
..their love also should be like
that of Paro and Madhav? - Yes.

1767
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:02,820
And some also start thinking
that they are Paro and Madhav.

1768
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:03,980
Yes.

1769
02:17:04,462 --> 02:17:07,220
Did you go to that jungle 
with Mr. Mohan? - Yes.

1770
02:17:07,436 --> 02:17:11,100
And because you love Mr. Mohan, 
in the passion of love..

1771
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:13,980
..you thought that you're
Paro and he is Madhav.

1772
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:15,700
I firmly believe
that I was Paro!

1773
02:17:16,215 --> 02:17:18,380
Is Dr. Naresh treating you?
- Yes.

1774
02:17:18,594 --> 02:17:20,220
For which illness
is he treating you?

1775
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:23,826
He thinks that there is
some confusion in my mind.

1776
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:26,983
How were you killed? - I?

1777
02:17:27,063 --> 02:17:28,260
I mean Paro.

1778
02:17:28,507 --> 02:17:29,820
Was the head cut
off with an axe?

1779
02:17:30,117 --> 02:17:32,470
Was she shot? Was a knife 
stuck in her stomach?

1780
02:17:32,550 --> 02:17:33,620
Objection, Your Honour!

1781
02:17:33,740 --> 02:17:34,571
I don't know!

1782
02:17:34,651 --> 02:17:39,100
Do you know that a man, this
man is being sent to the gallows..

1783
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:42,005
..just because of you?
- Because of me?!

1784
02:17:42,085 --> 02:17:44,820
Mr. Mohan has accused him
of murder, don't you now that?

1785
02:17:45,285 --> 02:17:48,100
I don't know! - The whole
world knows, yet you don't know?

1786
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:50,967
Your Honour, the truth is being
presented in a twisted manner!

1787
02:17:51,047 --> 02:17:51,860
I don't know!

1788
02:17:51,980 --> 02:17:53,100
Your Honour, please tell him
that he will be given a chance..

1789
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:55,820
..to ask questions,
he should keep quiet.

1790
02:17:56,214 --> 02:17:59,620
You will be given a chance.
Continue with your questions.

1791
02:18:01,901 --> 02:18:04,750
Chandramukhi, your parents 
think you are insane.

1792
02:18:04,830 --> 02:18:06,534
Dr.Naresh thinks 
you are insane.

1793
02:18:06,614 --> 02:18:08,500
Do you also sometimes
consider yourself to be insane?

1794
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:09,660
No, no! - Objection!

1795
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:12,420
I am not insane!
- I say that you are insane!

1796
02:18:12,614 --> 02:18:14,180
No, I am not insane!

1797
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:16,140
Chandramukhi, you
are totally insane!

1798
02:18:16,220 --> 02:18:17,340
Your Honour!
- No, I am not insane!

1799
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:18,860
Your Honour, please stop her!

1800
02:18:19,231 --> 02:18:22,393
I am amazed! How is she 
allowed to do such a thing?

1801
02:18:22,473 --> 02:18:23,860
She is crossing the limit!

1802
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:26,960
If you continue like this, the
cross-examination will be stopped.

1803
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,320
I am not insane!
I am not insane!

1804
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:32,560
I have no further questions.

1805
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:34,760
Your witness.

1806
02:18:36,203 --> 02:18:38,400
In this condition, I don't
want to ask her any questions.

1807
02:18:46,290 --> 02:18:51,000
Dr. Naresh had warned that
if she is brought to the court..

1808
02:18:51,447 --> 02:18:53,400
..her brain can receive a jolt.

1809
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:57,200
Your Honour, call
Dr. Naresh to the witness box.

1810
02:19:09,578 --> 02:19:11,960
Place your hand on Gita
and swear to tell the truth.

1811
02:19:12,551 --> 02:19:14,120
I will tell the truth and
nothing but the truth.

1812
02:19:14,724 --> 02:19:16,560
Name. - Naresh Gupta.

1813
02:19:16,951 --> 02:19:18,800
Profession. - Psychiatrist.

1814
02:19:19,091 --> 02:19:22,320
So you treat mental illnesses.
- Yes.

1815
02:19:22,842 --> 02:19:24,320
During the treatment,
you hypnotize the patients..

1816
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:26,320
..and take them
back to the childhood..

1817
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:29,640
..so that you can find
the cause of the illness.

1818
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,760
Is this correct? - Correct.

1819
02:19:32,388 --> 02:19:34,440
Till what age do
you take them back?

1820
02:19:34,800 --> 02:19:37,200
Fifteen, ten, five.

1821
02:19:37,978 --> 02:19:40,320
In the course of your studies,
were you taught that a patient..

1822
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:42,920
..can be taken
back to past birth?

1823
02:19:43,373 --> 02:19:44,400
No.

1824
02:19:44,627 --> 02:19:48,360
So your science does not
accept that there is past birth.

1825
02:19:49,081 --> 02:19:49,967
No.

1826
02:19:50,047 --> 02:19:51,434
So, how did you take
Chandramukhi back..

1827
02:19:51,514 --> 02:19:54,200
..to her past birth
during her treatment?

1828
02:19:54,714 --> 02:19:56,200
She regressed on her own.

1829
02:19:56,466 --> 02:19:58,480
Didn't you feel
any risk in that?

1830
02:20:00,661 --> 02:20:01,461
I did.

1831
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:05,080
What kind of risk, Dr. Naresh?

1832
02:20:08,045 --> 02:20:09,680
That I may not be
able to bring her back.

1833
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:12,200
And what would have happened
if you failed to bring her back?

1834
02:20:15,635 --> 02:20:16,840
She could have become insane.

1835
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:19,640
After that, did you ever
take her back to past birth?

1836
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:23,344
Yes.

1837
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:26,320
Despite knowing that you
have no experience in the field..

1838
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:30,080
..no right, and neither your
science or the law permit it? - Yes.

1839
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:33,440
And despite knowing that
Chandramukhi may become insane?

1840
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:36,440
Yes.

1841
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:39,400
That means you
acted very unwisely.

1842
02:20:39,863 --> 02:20:42,320
You deliberately
put the patient at risk!

1843
02:20:43,257 --> 02:20:46,320
A doctor like you shouldn't
be allowed to treat people!

1844
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:48,760
And.. - Keep your questions
within the scope of the case.

1845
02:20:49,344 --> 02:20:50,320
This is the last warning to you.

1846
02:20:50,911 --> 02:20:52,960
I respectfully beg your
pardon, Your Honour.

1847
02:20:53,300 --> 02:20:54,680
I won't repeat the mistake.

1848
02:20:55,490 --> 02:20:56,570
Last question.

1849
02:20:57,730 --> 02:20:59,450
Isn't it possible that
whatever Chandramukhi said..

1850
02:20:59,530 --> 02:21:01,450
..while being in her
past birth, could just be..

1851
02:21:01,530 --> 02:21:03,610
..the effect of her
mental confusion?

1852
02:21:03,730 --> 02:21:06,010
It is possible, but..
- But it is possible!

1853
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:09,290
Yes, it is possible.

1854
02:21:10,393 --> 02:21:12,970
No more questions, you may go.

1855
02:21:19,571 --> 02:21:24,944
Your Honour, I ask
this court, I ask the law..

1856
02:21:25,279 --> 02:21:28,010
..I ask the law-makers
of the world!

1857
02:21:28,338 --> 02:21:32,330
Can we trust a girl's uttering,
whose mental condition is unstable?

1858
02:21:32,717 --> 02:21:35,004
Can we trust a doctor,
who deliberately puts..

1859
02:21:35,084 --> 02:21:36,890
..a patient's life in danger?

1860
02:21:37,010 --> 02:21:41,450
Can we trust a drunkard police
inspector who has been sacked..

1861
02:21:41,530 --> 02:21:45,450
..and who couldn't understand
that Paro was a maid servant..

1862
02:21:45,530 --> 02:21:47,450
..and not just a necklace,
but she could have left..

1863
02:21:47,530 --> 02:21:49,530
..anything in any of the rooms?

1864
02:21:52,890 --> 02:21:58,450
Your Honour, this case is
about the murder of humanity..

1865
02:21:58,530 --> 02:22:00,970
..decency and nobility.

1866
02:22:01,450 --> 02:22:04,090
This case is an
insult to the law.

1867
02:22:04,170 --> 02:22:08,570
Such a humbug case would never 
have been fought in any court.

1868
02:22:09,890 --> 02:22:15,330
Therefore I request the court to
dismiss the case immediately..

1869
02:22:15,982 --> 02:22:19,330
..and honorably
acquit the accused.

1870
02:22:19,799 --> 02:22:20,890
Thank you, Your Honour.

1871
02:22:25,330 --> 02:22:28,450
Today is Saturday. As per the law, 
you are granted time..

1872
02:22:28,685 --> 02:22:32,250
..till Monday to
present valid evidence.

1873
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:35,050
Or else the case
will be dismissed.

1874
02:22:42,404 --> 02:22:46,810
Papa, on Monday I will take
you home honorably acquitted.

1875
02:22:47,874 --> 02:22:49,650
Papa, I am very lonely.

1876
02:23:01,045 --> 02:23:03,445
I want to see Karuna.
- At this time?

1877
02:23:03,525 --> 02:23:05,240
Yes, it's urgent. Go and tell her 
that Dr. Naresh has come.

1878
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:06,525
Go, hurry!

1879
02:23:08,645 --> 02:23:11,165
Madam, Dr. Naresh
wants to see you.

1880
02:23:12,364 --> 02:23:13,725
Tell him that 
I cannot see him.

1881
02:23:17,174 --> 02:23:19,965
Only silence
remained in this house.

1882
02:23:20,165 --> 02:23:22,165
You have come
to shatter that also?

1883
02:23:23,525 --> 02:23:27,066
I will apologize, but right now I
have come with an important request.

1884
02:23:27,239 --> 02:23:28,445
Tell me.

1885
02:23:29,304 --> 02:23:32,331
Mohan and I believe that the
evidence the court has asked for..

1886
02:23:32,411 --> 02:23:33,805
..can be found in your mansion.

1887
02:23:35,385 --> 02:23:39,165
Have you come to ask for
our sword to cut off my head?

1888
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:43,165
An innocent girl's
life is in danger!

1889
02:23:44,218 --> 02:23:47,165
An innocent father's
life is in danger.

1890
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:50,348
But you have come to
Chaudhary Janak Singh's house..

1891
02:23:50,428 --> 02:23:55,325
..with a plea, and we do not turn
away those who come to this house.

1892
02:23:55,805 --> 02:24:00,304
Therefore, tell Mr. Mohan that
not only will I give the permission..

1893
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:05,677
..but I will open the gates
of the mansion for him.

1894
02:24:19,525 --> 02:24:20,765
Come in.

1895
02:24:23,146 --> 02:24:24,325
Thank you.

1896
02:24:26,919 --> 02:24:28,525
Go in.

1897
02:24:30,085 --> 02:24:31,165
Thank you.

1898
02:24:31,492 --> 02:24:34,725
You can enter any
room you wish to.

1899
02:24:36,485 --> 02:24:39,845
This? - It used to 
be the drawing room.

1900
02:24:45,245 --> 02:24:46,525
Why did you bring me here?

1901
02:24:46,645 --> 02:24:56,685
"Sometimes it becomes
memories in adverse situations."

1902
02:24:56,805 --> 02:25:06,005
"Sometimes it becomes the
bright future in the springtime."

1903
02:25:06,125 --> 02:25:16,005
"There is darkness in one
hand and a lamp in the other."

1904
02:25:16,245 --> 02:25:20,645
"Destiny only
creates the cycle.."

1905
02:25:45,341 --> 02:25:46,421
It was here only.

1906
02:25:51,141 --> 02:25:52,221
Where did it go?

1907
02:25:52,746 --> 02:25:53,941
Paro.

1908
02:25:55,492 --> 02:25:56,941
I had come to get my necklace!

1909
02:25:58,141 --> 02:26:02,501
That night, even if some God
from heaven had seen what I saw..

1910
02:26:03,061 --> 02:26:04,861
..he too would have
descended to this room..

1911
02:26:05,156 --> 02:26:06,941
..and it would have
happened just the way it did.

1912
02:26:09,426 --> 02:26:12,981
I will take care
of you all your life.

1913
02:26:14,519 --> 02:26:16,821
And I will give you
whatever you want.

1914
02:26:16,901 --> 02:26:18,901
Can you return Madhav to me?

1915
02:26:19,892 --> 02:26:23,901
I am aware of your
sorrow, but Paro..

1916
02:26:23,981 --> 02:26:25,941
Don't you ever touch
me, junior master!

1917
02:26:26,508 --> 02:26:30,346
And if there is God, and if there
is justice, then junior master..

1918
02:26:30,426 --> 02:26:33,330
..just like Madhav
was snatched from me..

1919
02:26:33,665 --> 02:26:38,501
..someday, fate will snatch
your most precious thing!

1920
02:26:38,994 --> 02:26:40,181
'Come on, son!'

1921
02:26:40,594 --> 02:26:42,194
I am showing compassion to
you, but you keep cursing me!

1922
02:26:42,389 --> 02:26:43,741
'Son, come on!'

1923
02:26:45,141 --> 02:26:46,861
Shut up.
Senior master will hear you.

1924
02:26:46,981 --> 02:26:48,141
'Son, we are getting late.'

1925
02:26:48,261 --> 02:26:50,431
I will scream and tell the world!
- Don't go out!

1926
02:26:50,511 --> 02:26:51,861
I will tell the senior sir!
- Don't go out!

1927
02:26:51,941 --> 02:26:53,621
'Shall I come up?'

1928
02:26:54,333 --> 02:26:55,421
Senior sir..

1929
02:26:56,884 --> 02:26:58,021
I'll be right there..

1930
02:26:58,141 --> 02:26:59,741
Father, you will get tired
if you climb the stairs.

1931
02:26:59,941 --> 02:27:02,941
Go and sit in the rickshaw,
I am just coming down.

1932
02:27:03,327 --> 02:27:05,021
Son, what are you doing?

1933
02:27:05,252 --> 02:27:07,501
Father, I told you
not to climb the stairs!

1934
02:27:07,581 --> 02:27:11,101
It's not good for your health.
Yesterday you had fever.

1935
02:27:12,355 --> 02:27:14,981
Okay, I will wait
in the rickshaw.

1936
02:27:41,628 --> 02:27:42,581
Chandramukhi!

1937
02:27:51,456 --> 02:27:53,341
Chandramukhi! - Chandramukhi!

1938
02:27:54,526 --> 02:27:55,341
Chandramukhi!

1939
02:28:03,369 --> 02:28:04,381
Chandramukhi, what
happened after that?

1940
02:28:05,379 --> 02:28:06,741
Chandramukhi, what happened 
after that? - Mohan!

1941
02:28:08,525 --> 02:28:10,925
Mohan, don't ask her anything
more, her condition is not good.

1942
02:28:11,445 --> 02:28:13,045
At least we found out how
Chaudhary Janak Singh..

1943
02:28:13,125 --> 02:28:15,085
..had killed Paro. - Yes.

1944
02:28:15,245 --> 02:28:17,245
But tomorrow, how will I
present the evidence to the court?

1945
02:28:17,445 --> 02:28:19,285
The court needs 
evidence! - Yes.

1946
02:28:19,725 --> 02:28:23,925
Look, take her home and
send a police inspector.

1947
02:28:24,005 --> 02:28:26,125
I.. I will try to 
find out something more.

1948
02:28:26,245 --> 02:28:28,925
Murder was committed!
In that very room!

1949
02:28:29,005 --> 02:28:31,925
How will you unearth evidence
for something that didn't happen?

1950
02:28:32,925 --> 02:28:34,045
Try to remember,
did someone come..

1951
02:28:34,125 --> 02:28:36,125
..after senior
master left for Delhi?

1952
02:28:38,045 --> 02:28:40,342
No one did, sir. - Think! Try to 
remember, maybe somebody did come!

1953
02:28:40,422 --> 02:28:42,325
Yes, sir. A mason had come.

1954
02:28:42,405 --> 02:28:44,925
To repair a broken
wall upstairs.

1955
02:28:45,045 --> 02:28:46,125
What was his name?

1956
02:28:46,485 --> 02:28:48,267
Beliram. - Beliram?
Where does he live?

1957
02:28:48,347 --> 02:28:50,125
Down there in the village.

1958
02:28:50,365 --> 02:28:52,045
Where is Beliram's house?
- Over there.

1959
02:28:52,565 --> 02:28:54,765
He has gone crazy
ever since his son died.

1960
02:28:59,925 --> 02:29:02,245
Beliram! - Have you come 
to express condolences?

1961
02:29:02,525 --> 02:29:04,245
He died last year.

1962
02:29:04,365 --> 02:29:07,991
Beliram, I need your help. - Now nobody 
comes to express condolences.

1963
02:29:08,071 --> 02:29:09,445
Beliram, listen! Listen to me!

1964
02:29:10,165 --> 02:29:12,045
Listen to me!
- Let me take rest.

1965
02:29:12,245 --> 02:29:14,125
I want to ask you something.
- Is that so?

1966
02:29:15,525 --> 02:29:18,085
Do you remember the mansion?
Junior master had taken you there.

1967
02:29:18,488 --> 02:29:19,485
He might have taken me.

1968
02:29:20,125 --> 02:29:24,845
Nowadays, you don't get 
good tobacco. Drink water.

1969
02:29:25,165 --> 02:29:28,245
It has been 30 years.
Think. 30 years ago.

1970
02:29:28,925 --> 02:29:30,565
I used to work very hard.

1971
02:29:31,082 --> 02:29:33,082
The junior master had taken 
you there. To the mansion.

1972
02:29:33,445 --> 02:29:34,347
The mansion!

1973
02:29:34,427 --> 02:29:35,536
The mansion? - Yes.

1974
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,845
Okay.

1975
02:29:37,045 --> 02:29:38,125
Come with me.

1976
02:29:43,352 --> 02:29:48,232
Yes! This is the one!
The mansion.

1977
02:29:49,125 --> 02:29:50,912
It has become very old.

1978
02:29:51,672 --> 02:29:53,472
Doesn't anyone live here?

1979
02:29:54,585 --> 02:29:57,552
Come on. Come on.

1980
02:30:02,472 --> 02:30:03,552
Who is she?

1981
02:30:04,952 --> 02:30:06,032
Who is she?

1982
02:30:08,472 --> 02:30:12,792
The junior master said
it was an urgent job.

1983
02:30:12,952 --> 02:30:14,552
I shouldn't tell anyone.

1984
02:30:16,002 --> 02:30:19,032
I'm sure he must have hidden
treasure in there. - Really?

1985
02:30:19,712 --> 02:30:20,912
Come. - Come.

1986
02:30:24,192 --> 02:30:27,352
There should be a door here.
Open it.

1987
02:30:27,472 --> 02:30:28,552
Yes, there is.

1988
02:30:29,152 --> 02:30:31,032
There must be stairs.
- There are.

1989
02:30:31,152 --> 02:30:32,232
Come.

1990
02:30:33,473 --> 02:30:36,712
Upstairs there is one 
more room. Small one.

1991
02:30:36,832 --> 02:30:38,472
Yes, there is. Yes.

1992
02:30:41,128 --> 02:30:45,712
Yes, this is the one!
But now it has changed.

1993
02:30:47,139 --> 02:30:50,192
Yes, yes, there it is! - What?

1994
02:30:50,803 --> 02:30:54,032
What? - I had put those bricks!

1995
02:30:54,672 --> 02:30:57,272
That treasure.. the thing you 
were talking about.. - What?

1996
02:30:57,392 --> 02:30:59,152
Whatever you were talking
about, where is it? Tell me!

1997
02:30:59,272 --> 02:31:00,632
Behind! - Behind?

1998
02:31:00,712 --> 02:31:02,752
Behind the bricks!
- Behind the bricks!

1999
02:31:06,272 --> 02:31:07,752
We will have to break the wall.

2000
02:31:08,312 --> 02:31:09,672
You can do whatever you want.

2001
02:31:10,673 --> 02:31:11,752
Inspector!

2002
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:13,032
Constable! - Sir!

2003
02:31:17,552 --> 02:31:19,912
Break it. Start from there.
- Okay sir.

2004
02:31:22,176 --> 02:31:22,952
Up there.

2005
02:31:25,352 --> 02:31:26,432
Over there.

2006
02:31:30,472 --> 02:31:31,552
Careful.

2007
02:31:47,945 --> 02:31:48,832
It looks like a wooden box.

2008
02:31:49,080 --> 02:31:50,072
Yes, sir. - Take it out.

2009
02:32:11,977 --> 02:32:13,120
Sir, something 
is written there.

2010
02:32:14,161 --> 02:32:16,518
J. S.

2011
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:55,840
Mohan, I have lost.

2012
02:32:56,949 --> 02:32:59,920
Mohan, my life is
ruined in every way.

2013
02:33:04,657 --> 02:33:08,040
Once you had told me
that if ever I need your help..

2014
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:09,560
..you will readily give it.

2015
02:33:11,402 --> 02:33:12,992
Mohan, didn't you say that?

2016
02:33:15,543 --> 02:33:18,040
Yes, I had said that.

2017
02:33:18,365 --> 02:33:20,120
Mohan, help me today.

2018
02:33:20,332 --> 02:33:22,680
My father's life
is in your hands.

2019
02:33:22,992 --> 02:33:26,040
Mohan, I beg to
you to spare his life.

2020
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:33,840
Now the matter is
no longer in his hands.

2021
02:33:40,008 --> 02:33:41,160
It is in the hands of the law.

2022
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:48,040
Constable, tomorrow
this skeleton..

2023
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:50,819
..will be presented in the
court, with due precautions.

2024
02:33:50,899 --> 02:33:52,200
Yes, sir.

2025
02:34:08,429 --> 02:34:10,120
Consider Mr. Chaudhary
as good as gone.

2026
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:28,080
Today she is
sleeping peacefully.

2027
02:34:29,228 --> 02:34:31,560
The evidence was unearthed.
- Good.

2028
02:34:32,741 --> 02:34:34,760
So why do you look troubled?

2029
02:34:36,503 --> 02:34:41,400
Madam, my daughter is very
ill, I will go and make a call.

2030
02:35:50,031 --> 02:35:52,311
Is the public prosecutor there?
- No, he is not there.

2031
02:35:52,391 --> 02:35:54,071
I am Dr. Naresh speaking.
What's the matter?

2032
02:35:54,151 --> 02:35:56,191
The mansion is on fire!
- The mansion?!

2033
02:36:20,628 --> 02:36:21,791
Nobody move ahead!

2034
02:36:22,433 --> 02:36:25,631
Doctor!

2035
02:36:28,509 --> 02:36:30,541
Karuna! Karuna!

2036
02:36:38,391 --> 02:36:41,071
Karuna! Karuna!

2037
02:36:42,995 --> 02:36:44,311
Karuna!

2038
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:55,621
Karuna!

2039
02:37:09,298 --> 02:37:12,227
Karuna! Karuna!

2040
02:37:12,854 --> 02:37:14,086
Oh, God!

2041
02:37:25,935 --> 02:37:27,870
Call an ambulance. - Okay, sir.

2042
02:37:30,303 --> 02:37:31,351
Mohan.

2043
02:37:34,746 --> 02:37:38,671
Mohan. Mohan.

2044
02:37:49,992 --> 02:37:53,632
Karuna. Karuna. - Mohan.

2045
02:37:54,712 --> 02:38:00,305
I have saved papa's life.

2046
02:38:08,477 --> 02:38:09,472
Oh, God!

2047
02:38:22,142 --> 02:38:27,272
I feel very sorry that we have to
carry on the court proceedings..

2048
02:38:28,337 --> 02:38:29,632
..on this sorrowful day.

2049
02:38:31,916 --> 02:38:34,992
The public prosecutor can
present evidence if he wants to.

2050
02:38:39,512 --> 02:38:43,312
Your Honour, I
have nothing to say..

2051
02:38:44,423 --> 02:38:48,752
..except that I want to withdraw 
this case. - Pardon me, Your Honour.

2052
02:38:50,456 --> 02:38:53,512
I request you to let
me speak something.

2053
02:38:54,435 --> 02:38:57,352
What is the use when the
case is being withdrawn?

2054
02:38:57,472 --> 02:39:00,992
Your Honour, knowing that, I
seek permission to say something.

2055
02:39:02,791 --> 02:39:04,392
Permission granted.

2056
02:39:07,872 --> 02:39:12,512
Your Honour, there is a
higher court beyond this court..

2057
02:39:13,632 --> 02:39:16,712
..the verdict of which
has touched my soul.

2058
02:39:18,592 --> 02:39:22,352
There, evidence is not asked
for, but punishment is given.

2059
02:39:23,841 --> 02:39:28,074
The evidence that this court
needed must have been found..

2060
02:39:28,154 --> 02:39:30,512
..but my daughter burnt it.

2061
02:39:30,992 --> 02:39:33,429
And because she found
that her father was guilty..

2062
02:39:33,764 --> 02:39:34,952
..she died in the fire.

2063
02:39:36,952 --> 02:39:41,272
Which punishment can be
more terrible than the fact that..

2064
02:39:42,013 --> 02:39:45,352
..this wound will keep
festering till my death.

2065
02:39:48,143 --> 02:39:53,272
Destiny has squeezed
my heart in such a way..

2066
02:39:55,397 --> 02:39:58,472
..that all my
hopes, my desires..

2067
02:39:59,050 --> 02:40:04,823
..my pride have 
been shattered.

2068
02:40:05,634 --> 02:40:08,352
And now..
and now nothing remains.

2069
02:40:11,418 --> 02:40:14,352
I had only one desire.

2070
02:40:15,277 --> 02:40:19,094
To give all the happiness
in the world to my daughter.

2071
02:40:20,251 --> 02:40:22,912
To leave behind only
happiness for her.

2072
02:40:23,516 --> 02:40:26,997
But it could not be done.

2073
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:29,912
Just one sin of mine.

2074
02:40:32,694 --> 02:40:37,018
Took her life.

2075
02:40:42,315 --> 02:40:46,792
She wished that Mohan
should marry Chandramukhi.

2076
02:40:47,667 --> 02:40:49,792
I give everything
I own to Mohan.

2077
02:40:50,627 --> 02:40:55,467
And confessing my
crime before everyone..

2078
02:40:56,228 --> 02:40:57,839
..and after accepting the
verdict of the Higher court..

2079
02:40:58,088 --> 02:41:00,217
..I seek punishment
from this court as well.

2080
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:03,587
Please, grant my request.

2081
02:41:08,217 --> 02:41:14,067
Considering all the aspects, 
the court sentences..

2082
02:41:15,591 --> 02:41:18,023
..the accused to
life imprisonment.

2083
02:41:23,227 --> 02:41:24,507
Bless you!

2084
02:41:25,386 --> 02:41:26,547
Bless you!

2085
02:41:34,877 --> 02:41:36,547
May you be happy!

2086
02:42:04,132 --> 02:42:08,467
'And if there is God, and if there
is justice, then junior master..

2087
02:42:08,547 --> 02:42:11,256
..just like Madhav
was snatched from me..

2088
02:42:11,336 --> 02:42:16,099
..someday, fate will snatch
your most precious thing!'

2089
02:42:17,461 --> 02:42:27,414
"It follows everywhere
those who hide themselves."

2090
02:42:27,494 --> 02:42:31,959
"It gives such a punishment..

2091
02:42:32,499 --> 02:42:36,690
..which pierces mind and body."

2092
02:42:36,770 --> 02:42:46,712
"Then it washes with tears
the wounds of the heart."

2093
02:42:46,792 --> 02:42:56,219
"Destiny only creates the
cycle of joys and sorrows."

2094
02:42:56,673 --> 02:43:06,347
"It is manifested in
the lines on the palms."

2095
02:43:06,662 --> 02:43:16,673
"Destiny only creates the
cycle of joys and sorrows."
