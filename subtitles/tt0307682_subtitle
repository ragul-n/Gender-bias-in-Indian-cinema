1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,680
Oh I am sorry... actually...

3
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,560
To staggering in this age is good
 but often it becomes bad also.

4
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,422
Excuse me I'm Karan...

5
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:02,677
Hey Karan, by the way,
 what is your opinion about this staggering?

6
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,866
Hey Karan, what happened to you?
 There are marks of lipstick upon your cheeks?

7
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,243
This is the mark of lips of some beautiful
 girl.

8
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,080
We know that but we don't know who the
 girl is.

9
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,790
Ye meri natkhati college ki...

10
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,333
What is her name?

11
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,209
I don't know.

12
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,877
What class is she in?
 - I don't know.

13
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:41,549
She turned you into a crazy person
 and left a mark on your cheek!

14
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,483
"Oh my friends..."

15
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,654
"The ladies of college"

16
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,115
"Ladies"

17
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:52,579
"Don't look at me so lovingly"

18
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:05,008
"For my wants..."

19
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:13,683
"...don't risk your beauty"

20
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:25,612
"Oh my friends"

21
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,908
"The ladies of college"

22
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,160
"Ladies..."

23
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,665
"Don't look at me so lovingly"

24
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,912
"I'm not the type that falls"

25
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:24,337
"I'm not the type that leaves"

26
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:33,680
"I will do anything for you"

27
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,561
"Don't give me your angry look"

28
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,691
"Oh my friends"

29
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,862
"Ladies of the college"

30
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,489
"Ladies..."

31
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:56,661
"Don't look at me so lovingly"

32
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,325
"Not everyone gets someone to love
 as easily"

33
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:43,875
"Love does not come easily"

34
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:53,176
"I am giving you everything"

35
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:58,723
"Think like I do"

36
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:04,270
"Oh my friends"

37
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,358
"Ladies of the college"

38
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,860
"Ladies..."

39
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,157
"Don't look at me so lovingly"

40
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,049
What are you doing?

41
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,552
She'll leave. Let me ask her name
 at least.

42
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,723
Let me go!

43
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,727
Excuse me...

44
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,772
Pooja, he's coming after you.
 - Let him come.

45
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,443
Let him speak at least.

46
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,948
Good morning Sir...

47
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,998
Do you people know only this thing
 "Good Morning Sir"

48
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,292
"Like little kids"

49
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:13,506
Good Morning... see speak slowly.
 This is college...

50
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,135
...it doesn't need to shout here loudly.
 I am also human being. Why do you shout?

51
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,346
Sir your battery...

52
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,474
Shut -up...

53
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:29,064
Talking about my battery... and what happened
 to your battery?

54
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,400
Being student of final year what
 do you do at the floor of first year?

55
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,364
Sir it happened suddenly...

56
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:42,369
Why am I not listening voices?

57
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,623
I had charged my battery yesterday,
 but why am I not listening?

58
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:53,922
Their lips are moving...

59
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,147
O.K. I understand this thing very well...

60
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:25,328
You bastards want to make fun of a
 deaf person... I have increased volume also.

61
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,146
You asked for her name in such style.

62
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,564
You did great!

63
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:38,735
Now how will you ask for her address?

64
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,490
Get out of the way!

65
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,993
Now she'll fall for it.

66
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,788
She's leaving.

67
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,082
Juliet is leaving but Romeo is still here.

68
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,167
You guys wait here,

69
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,379
I want to wash up.
 - Why?

70
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:47,095
Don't just wash. Take a shower and hurry!

71
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,807
Hi Pooja...

72
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,185
Why did you call me here?

73
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,313
Pooja, I waiting to hear something from you...

74
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,315
Tell me...

75
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:03,737
I don't know where to start...

76
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,822
If it is such condition in the
 beginning, what will happen in the future?

77
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,990
What?

78
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,618
No, you were saying something.

79
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,292
What is going on here?

80
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,461
We had two lectures so we have a
 free period.

81
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,212
What?

82
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,298
Sir two lecture...!
 - Talk slowly.

83
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,884
Sir, we attended two lectures so we
 have a free period.

84
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,510
What period?
 - Free period.

85
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,806
Shut-up. I hate with this word free.

86
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,185
You can see free everything these days.

87
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,270
Purchase two soaps get one soap case free.

88
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,855
Take two cokes get a free glass.

89
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:44,277
A professor is free with a teacher.

90
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,158
Everybody needs freedom.

91
00:15:50,158 --> 00:16:02,879
You become free but without education
 life is suffocation.

92
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:14,808
You may earn lakhs of rupees in business but
 this wealth is zero in front of education...

93
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,646
Education is most necessary.

94
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,191
Truth always becomes tart.

95
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:26,820
The real thing is that I have become a
 professor after studies

96
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,405
I have become a very successful professor.

97
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:33,368
My salary is Rs. Ten Thousands but
 I have to pay loans of Rs. Two Lakhs.

98
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:38,957
I don't know when shall I become free...

99
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:48,425
Mishraji is eating ripe mangoes.
 Let's go talk to him

100
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:02,105
Mishraji, are you having unriped Mangoes?

101
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:08,611
No but my hand is. One day I'm going
 to end up slapping you.

102
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,573
You should save yourself from Mishraji.

103
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,451
He always has a loaded gun...

104
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:18,121
Do you even use the gun or do you just
 carry it around?

105
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,290
What did you say?

106
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,876
No I was only asking...

107
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,796
Two years ago I went on a picnic
 in the forest of Madhuwabala.

108
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:32,886
When I was coming back, I saw two lions.

109
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,265
Do you know how much cartridges
 were in my gun?

110
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,893
Two...

111
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,146
I shot both the lions with one cartridge...

112
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,732
What... two lions with one cartridge?

113
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:49,694
I shot into the eyes of the lions and
 killed it.

114
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:54,199
Yes...

115
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,910
Do you know this is a joke? This is fact...

116
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,121
Now we should get out of here.

117
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:05,794
Once he starts speaking,
 there is no stopping him.

118
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:19,224
Chied of the Laskare Jist of which is the
 organization of terrorists and...

119
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:24,187
Because of him thousands have died.

120
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:29,401
"Last night he was arrested"

121
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:34,406
"He has control over a lot
 of other terrorists"

122
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:42,330
...government has kept him
 in some unknown place...

123
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,502
Welcome Asmakh.

124
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:35,008
We welcome you on behalf of India's land.

125
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,973
Did you feel any trouble in reaching here?

126
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:47,020
Thanks, death doesn't feel trouble to
 reach up to its destination.

127
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,316
It will be terror in your
 country now because...

128
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:57,113
...the Indian Government has invited
 devastation by arresting Asmakh UI Haq.

129
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:01,743
Our Government thinks that they finished
 terrorism by arresting Malik...

130
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,538
This is the misunderstanding
 of your Government.

131
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:11,419
This battle will be going on till we
 don't get out needs fulfilled.

132
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,758
It may not become without
 the help of Mr. Malik...

133
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,802
But Asmakh, even the top officers of
 military...

134
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,137
...don't know where he is remaining
 underground.

135
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:25,016
It is said that if you want to
 save the neck of a deer from a wolf...

136
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:29,229
...you catch the neck of the wolves first.

137
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:34,317
We need your help for this attempt.

138
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,445
I have so many weapons in my
 vehicle that...

139
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:42,534
...it can finish the name of this city
 with a single blast.

140
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:49,541
There is no doubt about your efficiency
 and this time our aim is not to get blasts.

141
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,170
I am entrusting your responsibility
 of purchasing...

142
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,756
...the whole staff and security for some
 airport.

143
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,592
So that we may commit
 high jacking of planes easily...

144
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,969
Plane Highjack...

145
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:06,558
After then your Government will demand
 for the release of Mr. Malik.

146
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:13,565
These are the documents
 of your Swiss Account.

147
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:17,902
We have deposited Rs. Five
 Crores upon your name;

148
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,406
you will get the rest of the money
 after completion of the work...

149
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:25,618
Thank you, when and how will you start work?

150
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:30,415
I will arrange everything

151
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:34,753
You don't tell this news
 to anybody in this city.

152
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,504
I shall arrange everything.

153
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,758
A lion never asks anything for its attack...

154
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:46,348
Where he goes, it becomes dangerous
 for others.

155
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:52,103
We shall meet in the future very soon...

156
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:30,392
Pooja... Pooja...

157
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,691
Teena do you have comics?

158
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:41,111
No I don't have...

159
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,448
Oh my God you have nothing...

160
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,340
After a big research I got
 ten romantic lines...

161
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,221
Hey sweetheart, come down Karan please...

162
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:24,112
How can light become away from lamp.

163
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:28,116
Say it romantically.

164
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:33,329
The nature has made us for each other...

165
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:45,175
I was feeling your shortage.

166
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:57,437
Take me into your arms in this way...
 I was sure that you would come.

167
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:03,109
Teena, oh where is she?

168
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:12,994
Hi Sweetheart... meet me at down...

00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:16,206

How can light become away from lamp.

171
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:28,677
Luck has made us for each other.

172
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:38,812
If you are thread I am kite... I love you...

173
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:44,275
Say that you are feeling very good...

174
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:54,202
Your arms has caught up to my chest
 the way a snake clings to a tree...

175
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:04,462
Exactly, Pooja, Teena what are you doing?

176
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:07,132
You're the one that called me
 here, with your letter.

177
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,425
What?

178
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,759
Pooja...

179
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,095
Make some pretension...

180
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,806
There is some misunderstanding.

181
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:19,019
No, no, it is very good
 understanding, not misunderstanding.

182
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:22,022
Now you try to implicate her.

183
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,773
Oh no Pooja...

184
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:27,652
Don't ever dare to touch me...

185
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:31,364
Please Pooja, listen to me.

186
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,742
You go at her, she will come to you...

187
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,368
You came running also.

188
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,911
I came to catch you.

189
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,414
Pooja, try to understand me

190
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:43,460
Exams are near...

191
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,629
Leave it. I have other tensions.

192
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:56,973
Pooja, I had sent that letter
 for you. You believe me...

193
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,642
Pooja, please believe me.
 I had sent that letter for you.

194
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,520
I am telling the truth.

195
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,448
If you don't believe me you can ask Teena.

196
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:17,285
Now you and Teena do whatever you want to do...

197
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,539
Sorry Sir...

198
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:34,719
Pooja... you don't say so. I shall die...

199
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:42,394
I'll have to do something about this
 deaf professor.

200
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:49,067
What happened to Karan, why
 is he behaving so?

201
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:54,030
Is he not making fool to us?

202
00:26:54,823 --> 00:27:04,374
Why can't I hear him?

203
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,043
He's making fun of me.

204
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:10,171
Go to hell...

205
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:30,358
Now leave it... it was the mistake of Teena,
 that she got the letter by mistake...

206
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,736
You don't have to take his side.

207
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,823
You have also taken a chance,
 but he didn't leave any chance.

208
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:40,660
He was speaking the dialogues
 of Laila Majnu being romantic.

209
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,414
He is not aware of it even
 that I was not there.

210
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:49,753
You act as thought I have been
 hugging him all the time.

211
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,506
I don't want to see his face also.

212
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:56,885
Don't speak so... he is cute.

213
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:57,969
He will be quite for you.

214
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,054
He is so handsome.

215
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,096
He will be for you.

216
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,097
He is so dashing.

217
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,433
He will be for you.

218
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:08,480
So you have no interest in him?
 - No!

219
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,816
Thank you so much.

220
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,693
You have got my line clear.

221
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,446
Now I shall go at Karan...

222
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:21,576
I shall snatch your eyes if you
 even will see at the side of my Karan.

223
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:26,164
Then this is the thing.

224
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,629
Wow, so cute.

225
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,715
He's asking for forgiveness so sweetly.

226
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:41,179
Please Pooja I am sorry...
 Please... forget...

227
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:47,894
Hey Hey so stupid mad...

228
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:56,945
Pooja, try to understand please...
 forget me please.

229
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,225
Wait.

230
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,024
Go.

231
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,070
This is very strange.

232
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,282
It is being search to me
 also for meeting you.

233
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:46,911
Birander, don't mind, those people who are
 in the game of gunpowder...

234
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:53,918
...take precautions with sparking.

235
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:57,547
You are one of our men anyways.

236
00:29:57,547 --> 00:30:00,633
Is this a safe place for your operation?

237
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:07,557
In the same way as like there is a
 tongue in the middle of 32 teeth.

238
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:11,353
What is your next move?

239
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:20,028
There is a list of 1,200 people,
 who will be on duty at that time.

240
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:27,160
It is not a difficult thing to
 make inactive 72 people.

241
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,581
We will have to spend a lot of
 money for rest of the people.

242
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:43,259
They ask for the currency of this country.

243
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:49,391
There should be no problem
 in out mission...

244
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:58,983
I shall try my best...

245
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:04,864
Birader, we pay money for success
 not for attempt.

246
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:12,622
It should be done at any cost.

247
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:27,846
Listen to me. Just call Pooja.

248
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:30,682
Yes Sir...

249
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:46,489
Brother what a surprise.

250
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:50,243
All of a sudden I wanted to see you,
 that's why I came.

251
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:54,956
O.K. It means you are not sad for
 staying away form your brother...

252
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,876
Brother, you don't say so...

253
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:02,630
I was making fun. Look what I got you...

254
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:10,764
Oh brother, do you know how much
 I love mangoes?

255
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:16,603
You came at Mumbai from Pune for
 giving these mangoes.

256
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,521
You should have sent it through somebody...

257
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:22,776
It doesn't require to say if all the
 ambitions may be fulfilled without asking...

258
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:30,116
Take these to her room.

259
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:36,206
Now tell me what else you need.

260
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:42,671
How can someone ask for something when
 all her desires have been fulfilled?

261
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,257
It's o.k. Then you start your studies,
 I'm going...

262
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:48,385
Oh no brother, you just got here-
 now you want to leave?

263
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,762
I will not allow it.

264
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:55,100
I have a lot of work. I will come again.

265
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,320
Eat your food on time.
 - Okay!

266
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,253
This is a very good vehicle.

267
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,213
He looks like a rich person.

268
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:29,676
He is a man of a good personality but
 his height is as like a camel...

269
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:37,142
You don't say a single word against
 my brother...

270
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,067
You should have introduced
 me. Come on Pooja...

271
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,277
Get lost...

272
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,570
Pooja, this is too much yaar.

273
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,655
I have been trying to make you understand
 for so long now.

274
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:53,658
Why don't you understand me?

275
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,289
Don't touch me...

276
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,791
What do you think of yourself?

277
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,794
You only know how to get mad... you think
 your the most beautiful girl in this world?

278
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:09,090
That I am such a person who did not
 see at the side of any girl except you...

279
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,053
else there are so many girls
 who are eager to love me.

280
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:17,140
You can try it...

281
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:25,690
I love you Pooja

282
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:32,298
"There is pounding in my heart.
 My heartbeat is crazy too."

283
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:35,135
"It cries and laughs"

284
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:38,221
"Something happens in my heart"

285
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:42,684
"It seems like I am in love"

286
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:50,942
"It seems like I am in love"

287
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:05,915
"I am neither awake or asleep. I am
 daydreaming"

288
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:11,546
"I am in a fantasy. I am saying something
 to myself"

289
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,343
"It seems like I am in love"

290
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:24,392
"It seems like I am in love"

291
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:13,108
"I don't know how I lost my sanity"

292
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:20,782
"I don't know how I lost my heart"

293
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:26,037
"What kind of weather is here? Craziness
 is everywhere"

294
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:31,501
"There is some magic upon me"

295
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:36,548
"It seems like I am in love"

296
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:44,431
"It seems like I am in love"

297
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:28,099
"I can't sleep all night"

298
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:35,857
"Someone's secretly taking away my
 sanity"

299
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:40,862
"Why do bangles ring?
 Why do bindi's sparkle?"

300
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:46,534
"Loneliness fulfills me and
 laughs at me"

301
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,706
"It seems like I am in love"

302
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:59,506
"It seems like I am in love"

303
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:14,562
"There is pounding in my heart.
 My heartbeat is crazy too."

304
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:20,235
"It cries and laughs
 something happens in my heart"

305
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:25,240
"It seems like I am in love"

306
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:33,039
"It seems like I am in love"

307
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:03,445
What happened?

308
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:04,571
Oh my God...

309
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,780
Where are you going?

310
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,491
Look at the time. The hostel gate will
 be closed.

311
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:11,661
So don't go.

312
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,847
Oh come on... See I told you they
 were gonna close the gate

313
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,141
Relax Pooja relax...

314
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,393
Mishrahi...

315
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:38,605
Yes...

316
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:50,200
Looks like he's dead asleep.

317
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,244
Now what should we do?

318
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:58,792
Here, lets sit here

319
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,675
Now what should we do?

320
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,678
We should talk...

321
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:13,973
I had already told you to go back soon.

322
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,559
Now God knows what will
 happen till morning.

323
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,522
Relax Pooja, this matter
 doesn't need tension.

324
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,983
Go to sleep.

325
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:05,442
What is this nonsense?

326
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,485
Were you sleeping sitting like this?

327
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:10,155
If you would have told me,
 I would have given you a pillow.

328
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:12,449
You might have slept more comfortably...

329
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:15,618
It is more pleasure in sleeping...

330
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:18,163
...keeping the head upon the shoulders of
 a beloved then sleeping upon a pillow.

331
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,248
I agree...

332
00:42:20,248 --> 00:42:24,419
I'll complain to principal.

333
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:32,052
I shall also tell it to the Principal that
 what is going on with the biology professor?

334
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:35,096
O.K. You visit me later...

335
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:41,728
She says to meet me later but him not
 interested.

336
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:49,486
May I come in Sir?

337
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:58,870
Sorry Sir...

338
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:02,665
Are you feeling shameful?

339
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:05,335
This is highly irresponsible behavior.

340
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:13,510
You have broken the rules of this hostel,
 so I suspend you both. You may go now.

341
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:51,589
Welcome Pooja, this is such place Pooja
 where I live with my family. My sweet home.

342
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:56,094
Only yours?

343
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:58,430
This is yours also.

344
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,766
Come; let me introduce you to my mother...

345
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:05,645
Who hit you?

346
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:10,734
I did. I was aiming for someone else,
 but you came in the middle.

347
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:13,903
What if I had gotten hurt?

348
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:16,781
What if my head had gotten injured?

349
00:44:16,781 --> 00:44:18,158
Who are you?

350
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:21,536

00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:37,148
Oh Pooja, are you left- handed?

396
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:38,733
This is her habit from childhood.

397
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:40,318
Very good.

398
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,489
It becomes good relationship with
 left-handed people.

399
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:48,326
Oh where is my lemon slice?

00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:44,257
Are you ok?

408
00:48:46,384 --> 00:48:50,805
Where is my drink glass?
 - Rahul where is my drink glass?

409
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:55,894
I thought that it was water,
 that's why I gave it...

410
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,313

Let me go drop her off...

416
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:15,372
Let her stay here.

417
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:16,748
Where will you leave her in such condition?

418
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:19,584
You tell her to stay in your room.

419
00:49:19,584 --> 00:49:24,005
Come Pooja...

420
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:39,521

"This heart..."

484
00:55:58,274 --> 00:56:03,571
We are happy with the fact that we
 got suspended...

485
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:05,949
Karan, is this called love?

486
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:08,743
How many members are in your family?

487
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:12,122
My parents passed away when I was very young.

488
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:17,794
There is my elder brother, who gave me
 the love of my parents.

489
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:22,257
Then he will worry on why
 you haven't gotten home yet.

490
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:26,678
No, no he will be surprised
 when I get home.

491
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:31,641
Because he doesn't know that
 we have been suspended...

492
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:35,895
And when will he come, to know about your
 suspension, he will be very angry.

493
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,480
I shall not tell him.

494
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:43,278
I shall tell him I came home cause
 I wanted to meet him.

495
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:47,449
My brother loves me so much...

496
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:51,202
That he could never get mad at me.

497
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,205
O.K. I am going...

498
00:56:54,205 --> 00:56:59,669
O.K. Come again. Karan, you go drop her...

499
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:11,639
Asmakh, are you here?

500
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:14,351
If you had called me on the phone
 I would have come over.

501
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:18,355
It will be a problem for me,
 if somebody sees me...

502
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:23,151
Birader, don't mind, this is an old
 saying-that if...

503
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,238
...it becomes the relationship of rat
 with mongoose...

504
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:30,700
...it doesn't require to be afraid of snake.

505
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:37,832
This is city. We jump across the border
 as somebody goes out from courtyard.

506
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:47,217
I am paying just double amount of
 it as you had said.

507
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:54,516
Now you will have to do
 the double speed of work also...

508
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:56,976
We have plenty of time...

509
00:57:56,976 --> 00:58:03,066
There is little time and the date of
 condition has been changed.

510
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:08,363
You all of a sudden...

511
00:58:08,363 --> 00:58:10,240
I was missing you that's why
 I decided to come over...

512
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,075
I would have sent some vehicle if you would
 have informed me earlier...

513
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:15,286
Your vehicle also reached in four hours
 and I can reach here within four hours.

514
00:58:15,286 --> 00:58:20,125
That's why I caught the flight and
 got here. Who is he brother?

515
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:23,378
There is garden of apples of mine.

516
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:39,185
You brother is my friend. Vijay what is
 the name of your loving sister...

517
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,605
Pooja...

518
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:58,079
You go and get fresh, I will be back...

519
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:06,880
What do you think of Pooja?
 - She's nice.

520
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,967
Just nice? Then there's no use in talking
 about her.

521
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:13,595
No No! She's really nice.

522
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:17,223
Does that mean that everything she said
 was true?

523
00:59:17,223 --> 00:59:20,226
Tell me!
 - Yes mom.

524
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:22,771
She told a sweet truth.

525
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:24,481
Did you like her?

526
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:26,816
A lot. We all liked her a lot.

527
00:59:26,816 --> 00:59:32,030
She came into the house once and she
 made a space for herself in our hearts.

528
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:35,492
You go oil everywhere.

529
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:39,120
I'll hit you! Sit straight!

530
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:41,873
Your not even eating. Come on and eat.

531
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:44,626
Will you feed me everything in one day?

532
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:47,462
You came so we made all your favorites.

533
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:53,176
Here eat this. It's great.

534
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:57,806
No dieting! Eat it for me.

535
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:06,147
Its great to see the love between a
 brother and sister.

536
01:00:06,147 --> 01:00:09,317
Now that you have come he's eating at
 home.

537
01:00:09,317 --> 01:00:13,196
Otherwise I see him come or go.

538
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:17,033
Brother, do want to ruin your good health?

539
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:18,576
I am saying the same thing...

540
01:00:18,576 --> 01:00:21,538
Why do you not have your food at home?

541
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,456
With whom should I have my food?

542
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:26,835
Who will give me company?

543
01:00:27,043 --> 01:00:32,048
Once you finish your studies then
 you stay with me forever...

544
01:00:32,048 --> 01:00:33,842
Forever?

545
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,385
Yes forever.

546
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,680
Because that fool of a person that
 marries you will stay here also.

547
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,640
Difficult...

548
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,310
That will be confirmed later, but for
 right now you stay here with me.

549
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:48,231
No, no brother, I have to go to college...

550
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:50,400
I shall talk to your principal...

551
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,530
Brother, you don't say it to
 principal. I shall stay here.

552
01:01:05,707 --> 01:01:06,791
Hello...

553
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:09,961
Pooja, are you done packing?

554
01:01:09,961 --> 01:01:12,547
I'm sorry Karan, I can't come.

555
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,466
My brother has asked me to stay a week...

556
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,301
What are you saying?

557
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:18,887
How can I stay here without you?

558
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:22,974
I have to play match also in the college...

559
01:01:22,974 --> 01:01:26,895
Don't say that. Its the respect of the
 college.

560
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,981
If you want for me to win
 this game you have to come.

561
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:32,025
Try to understand please.

562
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:35,236
I can't come, it's not possible.

563
01:01:35,236 --> 01:01:37,072
You have totally messed up my mood.

564
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:43,119
Try to understand me... I miss you Karan...

565
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:52,879
Brother, when was the last earthquake?

566
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:53,838
I don't know...

567
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:58,635
It's about to happen now because I am
 about to break everything in the house.

568
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:01,471
Because you are going somewhere
 without telling me...

569
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,264
This is very urgent work.
 I shall be back by tonight.

570
01:02:03,264 --> 01:02:05,934
At night? And I'm going to be here alone?

571
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:08,812
No. You can't go.

572
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:11,398
Try to understand. It's
 important.

573
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:15,318
Here take some money and so some shopping.

574
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:20,657
Bribe?
 - Not a bribe. Love.

575
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:33,795
Hello Dalfin Airlines.

576
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:35,630

Oh come on Karan, what happened?

581
01:03:10,123 --> 01:03:14,961
Karan, what's on your mind man?

582
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:20,425
Your are not playing with your heart...

583
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:25,388
What can I do if your heart is
 not in control?

584
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:35,815
Karan all the best come on...

585
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:13,413
We are really late Karan... please

586
01:05:13,413 --> 01:05:15,415
Just a minute...

587
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:17,125
I am getting late... please

588
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,585
It would be great if you could stay...

589
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:22,297
My brother will kill me...

590
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:24,924
But your flight isn't until later...

591
01:05:24,924 --> 01:05:26,676
Karan, please I am going...

592
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:31,556
O.K. Pooja just give me a kiss

593
01:05:33,975 --> 01:05:36,895
Oh my God...

594
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:39,481
One more please...

595
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:42,567
This is the last one...

596
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:18,348
Don't make noise. Nobody will move here!

597
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:26,272
This plane has been high jacked.

598
01:08:26,272 --> 01:08:31,152
We shall not be responsible if
 somebody will try to be clever.

599
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,497
This plane has become high jacked.
 You get it landed at old airport.

600
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:43,331
But...

601
01:08:43,331 --> 01:08:48,044
But nothing, do as I say else I shall
 shoot you.

602
01:08:52,173 --> 01:08:56,177
Hello... hello control Tower...

603
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:09,733
A special report... Through reliable sources
 it has become to know...

604
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:15,613
...that some terrorists have high jacked the
 plane that was going from Mumbai to Pune...

605
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:24,164
The plane landed at the old airport, thats
 situated in the middle of Pune to Mumbai.

606
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:27,542
All the passengers are into
 the custody of terrorists.

607
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:30,962
The Chief Minister of Maharashtra has
 alleged the sorrow for this event.

608
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:33,173
He has contacted the Home Ministry.

609
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:36,009
No reason has been declared
 for this high jacking.

610
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:40,972
We shall tell this news in
 the next bulletin.

611
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:55,695
Pooja's plane has been high jacked.

612
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:03,513
I need to give a message.

613
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:36,546
We want to keep our demands to
 the Government through you...

614
01:11:39,215 --> 01:11:42,927
Terrorists had called to a correspondent
 kept their demands to Government.

615
01:11:42,927 --> 01:11:45,680
See it's live telecast...

616
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:50,352
We "Laskare Jist" take the responsibility
 upon us and...

617
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:55,690
...we give this order to the Indian
 Government...

618
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:59,986
...that they should get redeemed to Mirza
 Israf ul-Haq...

619
01:11:59,986 --> 01:12:05,909
...and his friends within two hours...

620
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:33,770
If the Government will not fulfill
 our demands...

621
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:40,777
...you will get a dead body after
 every half an hour...

622
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:48,201
This girl will be our next target...

623
01:12:54,874 --> 01:12:58,211
How is Pooja there...

624
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:02,966
Come on make haste...

625
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:11,349
Pick up the phone...

626
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:08,740
Brother, where are you going?

627
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:13,036
Asmakh the life of my sister is in danger.

628
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,080
She is traveling through the same plane.

629
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,331
So what?

630
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:20,794
If the Government will not agree to fulfill
 their demands, they will kill my sister.

631
01:14:21,169 --> 01:14:28,593
We have thousands of brothers.

632
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:35,141
We have seen thousands of sisters become a
 widow and children become orphans.

633
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:39,521
I've heard screams from my brothers
 and sisters.

634
01:14:42,315 --> 01:14:46,945
When I raise my voice, I was called
 a terrorist.

635
01:14:48,196 --> 01:14:53,952
When I picked up a knife, I was a
 criminal.

636
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:58,498
Ask yourself who won't let us live?

637
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:04,879
Who put the knives in our hands?

638
01:15:04,879 --> 01:15:10,427
Your ruler ship is remaining here from
 the last fifty years.

639
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:19,894
Now we are ready to die...
 It will make no difference...

640
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:27,944
Anyone who enters this battle will die...

641
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:34,993
Some terrorists have high jacked the
 plane, which was the Mumbai/Pune flight...

642
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:38,955
all the passengers on that flight are
 in their custody...

643
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:42,334
Oh my god-that's Pooja...

644
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:44,794
Grandma, she is Pooja aunty...

645
01:15:44,794 --> 01:15:56,348
Hello control room, this is my order to the
 plane...

646
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:58,266
The situation is very critical.

647
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:01,102
We should get them the fuel for the plane,
 that way...

648
01:16:01,102 --> 01:16:05,774
...we can buy some time and decide on
 what to do.

649
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,492
Why are people not telling us what's
 going on in the plane?

650
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:24,709
The terrorists have demanded for fuel.

651
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:30,674
The Indian Government has agreed for
 the security of the passengers...

652
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:42,644
Excuse me Papaji... Papaji, I need your
 help...

653
01:16:42,894 --> 01:16:44,979
Oh did you come here? Who sent you?

654
01:16:44,979 --> 01:16:46,314
Papaji, can I get a word in?

655
01:16:46,314 --> 01:16:47,649
Do you know that this is restricted area.

656
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:51,027
Papaji, I shall tell you everything.

657
01:16:51,027 --> 01:16:53,029
There's so much drama here-I
 am calling security...

658
01:16:53,029 --> 01:16:56,783
Papaji, please don't... I really
 need your help.

659
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:58,493
Papaji, they will not help
 me. Only you can...

660
01:16:58,493 --> 01:17:02,163
How can I help you?

661
01:17:02,163 --> 01:17:12,340
Let me explain... if you can help a little,
 I can reach up to that plane...

662
01:17:13,049 --> 01:17:17,053
The terrorists have taken the arms inside.

663
01:17:17,053 --> 01:17:18,263
They are dangerous people.

664
01:17:18,263 --> 01:17:20,015
You will loose your life, and me my service...

665
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,517
Papaji, my girlfriend is in that plane.

666
01:17:22,517 --> 01:17:25,478
Papaji please... she is my love.

667
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:26,980
Then what can I do?

668
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,273
Look, I have two daughters;

669
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:30,608
one of them is getting married next week,
 if I loose my service...

670
01:17:30,608 --> 01:17:36,156
Papaji, would you not help me if one
 of your daughters were in that plane?

671
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:47,667
Papaji, I shall die alone, but if I succeed,
 I can save the life of all the passengers.

672
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:57,552
Vahe Guru will help you. Change
 your clothes...

673
01:18:02,265 --> 01:18:06,770
You are alone in the plane and
 there is danger for you.

674
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:11,775
Are you not afraid of your life?

675
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:13,902
My life is in that plane.

676
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:18,490
If something is to happen to her-then
 what's the point of me living.

677
01:18:18,865 --> 01:18:26,081
Satnam Vahe Guru Satnam...

678
01:20:18,943 --> 01:20:26,201
This is the high jacker speaking... it has
 been passed half time but we couldn't reply

679
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:35,585
If it will be late like this we shall
 start to kill passengers...

680
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:41,925
...and the Indian Government will be
 responsible for it...

681
01:20:44,552 --> 01:20:50,558
We will have to sacrifice 118 people
 for keeping one accused in jail.

682
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:54,312
No we can't do so...

683
01:20:57,482 --> 01:21:02,987
Asraful Malik should be redeemed.

684
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:47,027
What?

685
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:49,070
A young man has attacked upon terrorists

686
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:51,865
Come on...

687
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:27,942
Arrest again to Malik...

688
01:24:27,942 --> 01:24:32,489
Close the gates and push him into
 jail again.

689
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,203
These are main head lines of the
 news today...

690
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:43,625
the disbursement of plane from the
 custody of terrorists and...

691
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:46,294
...one young person entered the plane
 with some secret gate...

692
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:47,796
...and he made the high jacking unsuccessful...

693
01:24:47,796 --> 01:24:51,925
During this news the Chief of Laskare has
 been sent to jail again.

694
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:56,805
The whole India is praising the young brave
 man whose name is Karan Malhotra.

695
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:05,438
Try to trace who interfered in our mission?

696
01:25:06,314 --> 01:25:12,654
Find him and teach him such a lesson that
 his name be finished from this country...

697
01:25:13,905 --> 01:25:22,872
Find him and teach him a lesson.

698
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:30,839
Pooja, nothing happened to you?

699
01:25:31,131 --> 01:25:33,633
I am fine. Alright...

700
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:38,763
Thank God-I was so scared.

701
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:47,272
Why did you go onto the plane?

702
01:25:48,898 --> 01:25:53,778
Brother after your departure I remembered
 that there is a function in my college.

703
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:56,364
And you were going to come home at night.

704
01:25:56,364 --> 01:26:00,326
So I thought that I would be back by then

705
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:04,873
I wasn't aware of the fact that the
 plane was going to be high jacked...

706
01:26:08,335 --> 01:26:12,130
It wont happen again.

707
01:26:23,975 --> 01:26:30,065
Mr. Karan Malhotra, we congratulate you, as
 your a National Hero in such short time.

708
01:26:31,691 --> 01:26:34,861
The people are praising you, but...

709
01:26:34,861 --> 01:26:40,575
...they are also eager to know how you knew
 about the secret gate on the plane...

710
01:26:40,867 --> 01:26:45,080
It was my dream to become a pilot
 because my father was in the air force.

711
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:48,249
I was always thinking something
 about the plane.

712
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:52,420
So I was aware of how to enter into the
 secret gate of the plane...

713
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:55,256
You are extremely gusty...

714
01:26:55,256 --> 01:26:59,761
...do you know that they all had weapons
 and you entered into the plane armless.

715
01:26:59,761 --> 01:27:04,432
I think that it is required excitement for
 the battle and...

716
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:09,104
...in the excitement a
 person can do anything possible...

717
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:14,150
Which was such excitement that it
 compelled to take risk of your life...?

718
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:19,155
It was the excitement of love.

719
01:27:20,115 --> 01:27:24,911
My love in the plane, so I jumped in to
 save her...

720
01:27:25,495 --> 01:27:31,459
Mr. Malhotra, would you like to
 say anything to our viewers?

721
01:27:33,294 --> 01:27:39,426
To the enemies of our country
 I would like to say...

722
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:45,724
...that it is impossible to fight with
 the soldiers who are at the border.

723
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:50,103
Only one Indian lover is
 sufficient to fight them...

724
01:28:27,349 --> 01:28:31,811
"I will pick you up and take you away"

725
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:37,359
"I will pick you up and take you away"

726
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:42,989
"Your friends will keep watching"

727
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:48,203
"I will pick you up and take you away"

728
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:53,500
"Your friends will keep watching"

729
01:28:54,209 --> 01:28:58,963
"You are in love with you"

730
01:28:59,381 --> 01:29:04,594
"You are in love with you"

731
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:09,766
"I will come to your house and
 become a bride"

732
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:15,188
"I will come to your house and
 become a bride"

733
01:29:15,563 --> 01:29:20,568
"My friends will be all alone"

734
01:29:20,944 --> 01:29:25,865
"You are in love with me"

735
01:29:26,241 --> 01:29:31,705
"You are in love with me"

736
01:29:56,938 --> 01:30:01,484
"Music will play at my engagement"

737
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:06,781
"Someday my bangles will jingle on
 your wrists"

738
01:30:07,615 --> 01:30:12,454
"I will keep Henna on my hands"

739
01:30:12,954 --> 01:30:17,334
"The bindi of love will sparkle
 on me"

740
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:22,589
"I am waiting for you my love"

741
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:28,345
"I am waiting for you my love"

742
01:30:28,636 --> 01:30:33,266
"I will pick you up and take you away"

743
01:30:33,641 --> 01:30:40,148
"Your friends will keep watching"

744
01:31:15,475 --> 01:31:19,854
"My heart has chosen you. Don't make it
 hurt"

745
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:24,984
"Don't let the season go away. Come
 close to me"

746
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:30,949
"How long will distance keep us apart"

747
01:31:31,366 --> 01:31:35,787
"The time for us to meet will come soon"

748
01:31:36,162 --> 01:31:40,959
"I can't wait my love"

749
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:46,548
"I can't wait my love"

750
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:51,803
"I will come and take you away"

751
01:31:52,137 --> 01:31:57,183
"Your friends will keep watching"

752
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,480
"You are in love with me"

753
01:32:02,897 --> 01:32:08,236
"You are in love with me"

754
01:34:20,702 --> 01:34:22,287
Are you alright?

755
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:26,041
Yes. The bullet barely hit me.

756
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:29,836
But Karen, we don't have any enemies.

757
01:34:29,836 --> 01:34:33,048
So who did they come to kill?

758
01:34:33,048 --> 01:34:34,507
They didnt come to kill you.

759
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:36,468
What do you mean?
 - Nothing.

760
01:34:36,468 --> 01:34:38,803
You carry to Vaibhav at doctor.

761
01:34:38,803 --> 01:34:41,973
I am going to leave Pooja at home.

762
01:34:43,183 --> 01:34:48,396
Sir the Government is so alert that
 if we shall take one wrong step...

763
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:51,358
...we may be arrested on the spot.

764
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:57,238
Sir, don't worry, we are planning to get
 redeemed Mr. Malik, we will inform you later.

765
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:04,871
Sit there is bad news.

766
01:35:04,871 --> 01:35:09,584
In the attempt to kill that boy,
 Sabod and Mojalin both have been killed.

767
01:35:13,588 --> 01:35:14,964
And that boy?

768
01:35:14,964 --> 01:35:18,635
That boy ran away...

769
01:35:24,557 --> 01:35:28,937
Pooja, what's wrong with you?

770
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:37,070
Why aren't you speaking to me?

771
01:35:39,906 --> 01:35:42,659
Who are you?

772
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:46,788
Brother, he is Karan.

773
01:35:48,164 --> 01:35:51,918
We are studying in the same college.

774
01:35:51,918 --> 01:35:54,212
But what is doing with you right now?

775
01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:58,049
What happened was that we went
 to a party as a friend's house...

776
01:35:58,049 --> 01:36:02,137
...and all of a sudden people entered
 and started firing...

777
01:36:02,137 --> 01:36:06,975
Now you can say it was her luck
 or life that she is safe.

778
01:36:06,975 --> 01:36:12,981
Later I realized that they had come for me.

779
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:19,154
They came for revenge of me saving 118
 people.

780
01:36:19,195 --> 01:36:23,575
But this time fate was not with them
 either.

781
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:25,326
What people are you talking about?

782
01:36:25,326 --> 01:36:29,456
Those highjack. I messed up their plan.

783
01:36:29,831 --> 01:36:35,378
This is a very strange thing that...

784
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:43,928
...those fools could not understand a simple
 thing.

785
01:36:44,304 --> 01:36:48,058
During the last thirty years what whether
 it may become so much quantity of ants...

786
01:36:48,058 --> 01:36:51,853
...they can't carry sugarcane...

787
01:36:52,979 --> 01:36:58,818
These boys whom you had sent
 to kill that boy, they couldn't kill him.

788
01:36:59,152 --> 01:37:02,530
The boy reached my house with Pooja.

789
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:04,366
It is possible that he may reach up to
 me also...

790
01:37:04,366 --> 01:37:10,789
What did you say, that that boy came to
 your home and you let him leave alive?

791
01:37:11,122 --> 01:37:15,126
Yes because my sister loves him.

792
01:37:15,126 --> 01:37:18,880
If she will come to know that I am
 responsible for the death of Karan...

793
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:24,678
...she will never forgive me, and I don't
 want any problems for my sister at any cost

794
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:38,608
Mother why do you tire
 yourself the whole day?

795
01:37:38,608 --> 01:37:40,819
You should rest at this age...

796
01:37:40,819 --> 01:37:44,322
Daughter-in-law, I had kept milk there.

797
01:37:44,322 --> 01:37:46,074
Just see that I had forgotten-

798
01:37:46,074 --> 01:37:48,284
Now what can "bhabhi" do alone?

799
01:37:48,284 --> 01:37:50,578
There should be some other person
 for her help...

800
01:37:50,578 --> 01:37:55,125
Uncle, you are flattering
 to Grandma very much...

801
01:37:56,001 --> 01:38:00,255
Mother, I am thinking that I should arrange
 some female servant for you...

802
01:38:00,588 --> 01:38:05,051
...who will help you all the time...

803
01:38:05,593 --> 01:38:09,514
A daughter-in-law can only do that
 much work.

804
01:38:09,514 --> 01:38:13,226
Then why not a daughter-in-law?

805
01:38:14,102 --> 01:38:16,312
What's going on here?

806
01:38:16,312 --> 01:38:17,897
What are you doing tomorrow?

807
01:38:17,897 --> 01:38:18,940
Why mom?

808
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:23,153
You can go to Pooja's house to talk
 about marriage.

809
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:26,406
Tomorrow is hard. I have an important
 meeting.

810
01:38:26,406 --> 01:38:30,618
What kind of work is this? When there's
 something important your not here.

811
01:38:30,618 --> 01:38:32,120
Please don't do this.

812
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,371
Understand Karen.

813
01:38:33,371 --> 01:38:38,835
Mom you guys can go. I'll take care of
 everything afterwards.

814
01:38:42,964 --> 01:38:45,592
Aunty, what a beautiful house this is...

815
01:38:45,592 --> 01:38:49,804
Your uncle is not smaller than some King...

816
01:38:52,349 --> 01:38:55,393
Please come... why Aunty didn't touch
 the feet of uncle...

817
01:38:55,393 --> 01:38:59,939
She will touch the feet. Let her
 become Aunty first...

818
01:38:59,939 --> 01:39:02,942
My brother has come...

819
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:06,738
Namaste Mother...

820
01:39:06,738 --> 01:39:07,989
She is the wife of Karan's brother.

821
01:39:07,989 --> 01:39:08,948
Namaste, why are you people standing?

822
01:39:08,948 --> 01:39:10,408
Be seated please...

823
01:39:10,408 --> 01:39:24,798
Namaste Uncle, Aunty had asked
 you to sit at my bedroom.

824
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:39,646
There is no change in the nature of Pooja
 as she has been maintained in love.

825
01:39:40,188 --> 01:39:43,817
She always admired you.

826
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:50,490
She should so it also because you had also
 given her love of both a mother and a father...

827
01:39:51,116 --> 01:39:54,744
Aunty, what a nice room is it. You
 have cartoons?

828
01:39:54,744 --> 01:39:56,121
Yeah, would you like to seem them?

829
01:39:56,121 --> 01:39:57,539
I don't mind...

830
01:39:57,539 --> 01:40:02,293
Karen and Pooja like each other
 very much.

831
01:40:02,293 --> 01:40:07,549
They've already decided to get
 married.

832
01:40:07,549 --> 01:40:13,596
Pooja is still young and doesn't understand
 the difference between good and bad.

833
01:40:17,726 --> 01:40:23,732
I do admit that we are lower than you
 in wealth.

834
01:40:24,566 --> 01:40:28,820
But God has given us respect.

835
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:34,826
Your sister will have enough happiness
 in our house for seven generations.

836
01:40:35,535 --> 01:40:39,247
I can't even imagine seven days.

837
01:40:39,247 --> 01:40:42,334
What are you saying?

838
01:40:42,334 --> 01:40:47,630
Pooja is my only sister and I will not let
 her go in the wrong direction.

839
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:54,637
What do you mean?
 - I say no to this arrangement.

840
01:40:54,971 --> 01:40:58,933
No son. This will break their
 hearts.

841
01:40:58,933 --> 01:41:00,602
What are you thinking?

842
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:04,773
I'm thinking about what I should ask your
 brother for dowry.

843
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:06,358
You won't get anything.

844
01:41:06,358 --> 01:41:09,444
Will I have to keep you for free
 you whole life?

845
01:41:09,444 --> 01:41:11,446
Not my whole life.

846
01:41:11,446 --> 01:41:14,657
Just seven generations.

847
01:41:16,493 --> 01:41:22,082
Mother I request it to you that don't
 get her under pressure.

848
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:29,547
I think that you are taking decision
 in hurry.

849
01:41:30,965 --> 01:41:42,602
This is the question of her life... I request
 you for happiness of those children...

850
01:41:57,784 --> 01:42:01,037
What happened?
 - He's said No.

851
01:42:01,037 --> 01:42:03,248
Why brother?

852
01:42:03,248 --> 01:42:06,584
May I know the reason for this?

853
01:42:06,584 --> 01:42:09,921
I'm talking to you Mr. Vijay.

854
01:42:09,921 --> 01:42:13,550
Mother, you have two sons.

855
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:19,931
If you were asked who was your favorite,
 you might say a name.

856
01:42:20,724 --> 01:42:26,855
But if someone was to ask who you wanted
 to shoot

857
01:42:28,314 --> 01:42:31,609
Would you be able to say one's name?

858
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:34,362
I only have one sister.

859
01:42:34,362 --> 01:42:38,324
At eight years old, I became a father
 instead of a brother.

860
01:42:38,324 --> 01:42:43,663
I fought everything to keep her
 alive.

861
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,458
I fulfilled her every wish.

862
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:50,503
For one want, I can't give her death.

863
01:42:50,503 --> 01:42:53,048
What are you saying brother?

864
01:42:53,048 --> 01:42:55,842
You won't understand

865
01:42:55,842 --> 01:42:58,970
I dont have anything against your love.

866
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:02,766
But your love wont last long.

867
01:43:03,099 --> 01:43:05,894
By fighting those terrorists...

868
01:43:05,894 --> 01:43:09,564
Karen has showed where he's going
 to end up.

869
01:43:11,733 --> 01:43:15,236
If not today, then tomorrow they
 will get revenge on Karen

870
01:43:15,236 --> 01:43:18,865
And you will go down with him.

871
01:43:20,241 --> 01:43:25,622
That's the reason I wanted to keep
 you away from Karen.

872
01:43:25,622 --> 01:43:31,503
You tell me was I wrong?

873
01:43:34,047 --> 01:43:41,304
If you want to show her death as a symbol
 of love then go ahead. I wont stop you.

874
01:43:45,558 --> 01:43:49,813
I got it that why were not in favor
 of this relationship?

875
01:44:05,245 --> 01:44:11,626
No Karen, how did you think that
 I might become so greedy for life?

876
01:44:14,921 --> 01:44:18,508
The loves has inspiration of dying
 together also...

877
01:44:18,508 --> 01:44:22,971
The lovers don't give death also.

878
01:44:23,179 --> 01:44:27,475
And I am not selfish that getting
 married with you...

879
01:44:27,475 --> 01:44:31,479
I want to snatch all the
 happiness of your life.

880
01:44:33,815 --> 01:44:37,027
Take care of your sister...

881
01:44:37,027 --> 01:44:38,820
Pooja...

882
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:43,408
Karan, you can't leave me... I shall
 not remain alive...

883
01:44:43,658 --> 01:44:46,161
Why have you made such condition?

884
01:44:49,706 --> 01:44:54,044
"This heart is crazy"

885
01:44:54,836 --> 01:44:59,466
"This heart is crazy"

886
01:45:00,133 --> 01:45:06,097
"This heart..."

887
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:28,370
"It says everything with it's eyes"

888
01:45:29,996 --> 01:45:36,795
"It never has to open it's mouth"

889
01:45:55,814 --> 01:45:58,817
Your crying?

890
01:46:01,403 --> 01:46:05,824
"This heart is crazy"

891
01:46:06,324 --> 01:46:10,870
"This heart is crazy"

892
01:46:11,454 --> 01:46:17,127
"This heart..."

893
01:46:19,212 --> 01:46:21,756
I dont have anything against your love.

894
01:46:21,756 --> 01:46:24,968
But your love wont last long.

895
01:46:24,968 --> 01:46:27,512
By fighting those terrorists...

896
01:46:27,512 --> 01:46:31,516
Karen has showed where he's going
 to end up.

897
01:46:31,766 --> 01:46:35,020
If not today, then tomorrow they
 will get revenge on Karen

898
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:38,648
And you will go down with him.

899
01:46:39,357 --> 01:46:45,155
If you want to show her death as a symbol
 of love then go ahead. I wont stop you.

900
01:47:56,768 --> 01:48:01,815
Have you ever thought that how shall I be
 feeling seeing you in such condition?

901
01:48:03,191 --> 01:48:05,527
Come and have food...

902
01:48:05,527 --> 01:48:08,905
Brother, I don't want to have my food...

903
01:48:08,905 --> 01:48:13,410
Nothing is likely to happen if you
 will leave your food.

904
01:48:17,372 --> 01:48:20,250
At least you have a glass of juice.

905
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:23,753
It will not go down from my throat.

906
01:48:23,962 --> 01:48:27,215
Your condition will be same till
 then you will stay in this city.

907
01:48:27,215 --> 01:48:31,302
That's why I want to send you to
 Poonam Aunties in America.

908
01:48:31,302 --> 01:48:33,471
Your flight is tomorrow morning.

909
01:48:33,471 --> 01:48:36,016
But Brother...

910
01:48:36,016 --> 01:48:39,394
This is my decision...

911
01:48:46,818 --> 01:48:51,865
Karan, I'll kill myself...

912
01:48:51,865 --> 01:48:53,199
Karan... What are you talking about?

913
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,325
What happened to you?

914
01:48:54,325 --> 01:48:56,327
My bother wants to send me to America.

915
01:48:56,327 --> 01:49:03,543
You carry me from here if you want to see
 me alive else I shall commit suicide.

916
01:49:05,712 --> 01:49:10,967
Pooja, you don't do so... I swear it to you,
 I am coming right now...

917
01:50:26,835 --> 01:50:32,007
Karan, I shall die without you...

918
01:50:32,007 --> 01:50:34,592
Pooja, what is this insanity?

919
01:50:34,592 --> 01:50:40,640
I have become away from my own life for your
 life, and you want to commit suicide?

920
01:50:41,141 --> 01:50:52,277
But now my brother wants
 to send me to America...

921
01:50:57,574 --> 01:51:00,118
Pooja, you go there.

922
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:06,166
At least your life will be safe there.

923
01:51:06,833 --> 01:51:10,754
I condemn such life, which is
 without your presence.

924
01:51:10,754 --> 01:51:14,841
Karan, you don't punish me in this way.

925
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:31,316
I can't take this... this is my bad luck that
 I couldn't give you anything except pain...

926
01:51:32,984 --> 01:51:44,079
You can give me most happiness in life...
 nobody know about his life except God.

927
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:51,044
You give me an opportunity to pass my life
 into your arms before my death.

928
01:51:51,419 --> 01:51:57,759
I shall think myself very much fortunate
 lady of this world.

929
01:51:58,134 --> 01:52:02,555
You carry me without you...

930
01:52:36,297 --> 01:52:41,219
Okay lets go.

931
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:04,034
Brother, I am leaving this home for always
 and I am going with Karan...

932
01:53:06,745 --> 01:53:08,496
You Karan Bastard...

933
01:53:08,496 --> 01:53:11,332
That bastard ran off with my sister.

934
01:53:11,332 --> 01:53:16,796
I am not worried about it whether he will
 love or die but I want my sister back...

935
01:53:17,422 --> 01:53:21,426
Birader, you don't worry.

936
01:53:23,053 --> 01:53:27,557
That fool has got my work easy,
 by doing such activity...

937
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:47,869
Mr. Vijay Verma what is your connection with
 the high jacking of the Mumbai/Pune flight?

938
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:51,790
There is no connection at all.

939
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:55,919
The mobile of one terrorist had fallen
 and it had been broken.

940
01:53:56,670 --> 01:54:02,384
There was last number of your mobile
 in the sim card of that mobile.

941
01:54:04,386 --> 01:54:07,972
Do you still have something to say?

942
01:54:49,431 --> 01:54:52,142
You sit.

943
01:55:29,512 --> 01:55:37,896
"We praise you God"

944
01:55:38,396 --> 01:55:47,030
"We praise you God"

945
01:55:47,405 --> 01:55:51,701
"What a face you have made"

946
01:55:51,701 --> 01:55:56,331
"Everyone is astonished"

947
01:55:56,664 --> 01:55:58,750
"What a face you have made"

948
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:01,086
"Everyone is astonished"

949
01:56:01,086 --> 01:56:05,507
"We are even shocked to see
 your magic"

950
01:56:05,882 --> 01:56:15,058
"We praise you God"

951
01:56:15,308 --> 01:56:24,484
"We praise you God"

952
01:56:43,628 --> 01:56:47,716
"The eyes drown you"

953
01:56:47,716 --> 01:56:51,845
"Your eyes tell me that your in love
 with me"

954
01:56:52,178 --> 01:56:56,558
"The wind blows your hair"

955
01:56:56,558 --> 01:57:00,895
"I've never seen a face like this"

956
01:57:00,895 --> 01:57:04,816
"The little that I saw you..."

957
01:57:04,816 --> 01:57:09,195
"...I felt like dancing"

958
01:57:09,654 --> 01:57:11,990
"The little that I aw you..."

959
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:14,200
"...I felt like dancing"

960
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:18,705
"I'm surprised to see your magic
 on me"

961
01:57:19,414 --> 01:57:27,881
"We praise you God"

962
01:57:28,381 --> 01:57:37,015
"We praise you God"

963
01:58:00,663 --> 01:58:05,001
"You look even more beautiful"

964
01:58:05,377 --> 01:58:09,964
"Whoever looks at you will think you
 are a lover"

965
01:58:09,964 --> 01:58:14,094
"The whole world can tell"

966
01:58:14,469 --> 01:58:18,723
"You are in love with someone"

967
01:58:18,723 --> 01:58:22,644
"You came into my life like a beautiful
 fragrance"

968
01:58:22,644 --> 01:58:27,107
"Your in my heart always"

969
01:58:27,524 --> 01:58:29,693
"You came into my life like a beautiful
 fragrance"

970
01:58:29,693 --> 01:58:32,153
"Your in my heart always"

971
01:58:32,153 --> 01:58:36,616
"We're surprised to see your magic
 on us"

972
01:58:36,991 --> 01:58:45,625
"We praise you God"

973
01:58:46,001 --> 01:58:55,510
"We praise you God"

974
02:00:17,092 --> 02:00:21,429
"Let me look at you one more time"

975
02:00:21,805 --> 02:00:26,101
"Let me give you my unconditional
 love"

976
02:00:26,434 --> 02:00:30,563
"I hope everyone gets a lover
 like you"

977
02:00:30,897 --> 02:00:34,943
"Who gives his life for love"

978
02:00:34,943 --> 02:00:39,197
"We have taken the vow..."

979
02:00:39,197 --> 02:00:43,952
"...we will not be apart"

980
02:00:43,952 --> 02:00:46,287
"We have taken the vow..."

981
02:00:46,287 --> 02:00:48,540
"...we will not be apart"

982
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:53,128
"We are surprised to see your magic
 on us"

983
02:00:53,378 --> 02:01:02,137
"We praise you God"

984
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:11,271
"We praise you God"

985
02:02:11,831 --> 02:02:14,501
Karan... Karan...

986
02:02:14,501 --> 02:02:15,877
Pooja, you don't stop jeep.

987
02:02:15,877 --> 02:02:20,507
You don't worry about me. Drive fast.

988
02:03:54,642 --> 02:03:57,395
All this happened because of me
 didn't it?

989
02:03:57,395 --> 02:04:01,691
If love is fire, it is necessary to burn.

990
02:04:03,735 --> 02:04:08,323
Although this is very difficult way,
 but we will have to go through it...

991
02:05:02,585 --> 02:05:05,005
Are you O. K?

992
02:05:05,005 --> 02:05:10,135
When there is love, it does not
 become realization of injury...

993
02:08:17,113 --> 02:08:22,744
What do you think that you are safe,
 as it has become so much firing.

994
02:08:26,247 --> 02:08:39,886
All these breaths are due to Hazrat UI...

995
02:08:56,861 --> 02:09:04,786
Now you must know that your hero is in
 my custody with his beloved.

996
02:09:05,704 --> 02:09:09,332
I have sent the copies of that tape
 to the press people...

997
02:09:09,332 --> 02:09:18,425
If you people will not redeemed to Mr. Malik
 it will be responsibility of his death...

998
02:09:18,758 --> 02:09:24,723
Our Vijay Vema agent will tell it that
 where have you bring to Mr. Malik...

999
02:09:44,993 --> 02:09:50,206
Are you cold?
 - Yes

1000
02:09:53,084 --> 02:09:55,879
Come.

1001
02:10:12,937 --> 02:10:16,733
Why it becomes so?

1002
02:10:17,901 --> 02:10:23,031
Being in love makes all fear
 disappear.

1003
02:11:09,244 --> 02:11:15,083
The main headlines... Karan Malhotra who had got
 plane of high jacking unsuccessful...

1004
02:11:15,417 --> 02:11:18,545
...is into the custody of terrorists
 Chief Asmakh...

1005
02:11:18,545 --> 02:11:25,010
He has demanded that if the Government will
 not get redeemed to their chief Asmakh Ulaq

1006
02:11:25,301 --> 02:11:30,890
...within twelve hours the Government will
 be responsible for death of Karan...

1007
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:33,685
This news has been spread over in the
 whole country as like fire.

1008
02:11:33,685 --> 02:11:36,855
The public has warned that it should
 be security of...

1009
02:11:36,855 --> 02:11:41,776
National hero at any cost
 else they will start violence...

1010
02:11:42,318 --> 02:11:50,201
Government has not taken any
 action regarding it...

1011
02:11:51,703 --> 02:11:54,039
It has become very bad situation in the
 whole country.

1012
02:11:54,039 --> 02:11:57,083
The people have come out upon the roads
 and they have kept demand...

1013
02:11:57,083 --> 02:12:01,171
...that it is responsibilities of the
 Government to protect the life of Karan...

1014
02:12:01,171 --> 02:12:03,506
See it is most necessary for me to meet him.

1015
02:12:03,506 --> 02:12:07,677
I beg your pardon for coming inside
 without permission...

1016
02:12:07,677 --> 02:12:11,848
...but this is the question of the life of
 my son and expected daughter-in-law...

1017
02:12:11,848 --> 02:12:12,849
Who are you?

1018
02:12:12,849 --> 02:12:16,394
I am Karan Malhotra's mother.

1019
02:12:16,478 --> 02:12:20,607
You people have awarded him with
 "Veer Chakkra" for his bravery.

1020
02:12:21,524 --> 02:12:26,946
Now his bravery has become the cause of
 his death...

1021
02:12:26,946 --> 02:12:29,657
...you are whole and
 sole of this country.

1022
02:12:29,657 --> 02:12:32,285
You can save the life of my son.

1023
02:12:32,285 --> 02:12:42,337
This is my request to you people
 please save the life of my son...

1024
02:12:49,344 --> 02:12:52,972
Nothing will happen against your son.

1025
02:12:52,972 --> 02:12:56,559
Your son is pride of this country.

1026
02:12:56,559 --> 02:13:01,106
It is our responsibility to
 protect him... l.G. Sahab...

1027
02:13:01,398 --> 02:13:02,732
Yes Sir...

1028
02:13:02,732 --> 02:13:04,651
Get redeemed to Malik quickly...

1029
02:13:04,651 --> 02:13:07,237
Right Sir...

1030
02:13:56,745 --> 02:14:00,999
He is part of everything.

1031
02:14:00,999 --> 02:14:05,420
He has had a hand in everything that has
 happened.

1032
02:14:19,601 --> 02:14:21,478
We have completed your wish.

1033
02:14:21,478 --> 02:14:25,357
Send them here and we will send him
 there.

1034
02:14:25,357 --> 02:14:28,443
Go.

1035
02:14:59,307 --> 02:15:04,646
Then you are the person due to whom the
 chains are remaining upon my body and...

1036
02:15:05,271 --> 02:15:11,069
...due to you I was compelled to tolerate
 the darkness of darkroom also...
