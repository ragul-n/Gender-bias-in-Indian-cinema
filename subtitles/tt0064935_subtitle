1
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,937
Congratulations, Samar. I heard
that you're getting married.

2
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,105
What was the hurry?

3
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,773
You should
have completed the studies.

4
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,852
Where are you going? Listen!

5
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,113
Guruji was saying that Samar
will do some great job..

6
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,381
..when he grows up.

7
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,787
He's done it so soon.

8
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,791
He used to boast so much
in the class room..

9
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,952
..that he'd do many
a great things.

10
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,962
That his ideal man was 'Netaji'.

11
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,793
Everyone says that.

12
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,799
Look at Divakar. What
a man he was!

13
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,462
And now after marriage all his
dreams and ideals are gone.

14
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,802
He goes straight home as soon
as he leaves the office.

15
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,999
He is going to be
in the same state.

16
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,500
Samar, you should
get married now.

17
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,837
Your elder brother married
eight years back.

18
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,237
And now I am also unable
to work much.

19
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,175
Get me a daughter in law
so that I would be freed.

20
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,837
No, mother, I don't
want to marry now.

21
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,516
I haven't yet finished
my studies.

22
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,847
And who can study after
marriage?

23
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,112
I have to think of my future.

24
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,848
Wants to think of future!
Speaks English, eh?

25
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,858
As if only you have a future
and this family doesn't.

26
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,862
Do you know I am still paying
the debts of Munni's wedding?

27
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,363
Where will I get that money
from?

28
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,524
Have you ever though of that?

29
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,261
Wants to think of his future!

30
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,869
Whether one is able to do
something in life or not..

31
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,941
..one is forced to marry; one
is tied down in shackles.

32
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,040
Lalaji, every one has
to marry some day.

33
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,875
Everyone has to die some day;
so shall we die right now?

34
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,482
What are you saying, Lalaji?

35
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,546
The girl is educated till
standard 10th, Lalaji.

36
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,891
Our family hasn't had an
educated daughter in law..

37
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,221
..for 7 generations.

38
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,624
You can have a nice chat
with her in English.

39
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,399
And that is why the
country needs brave..

40
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,306
..and dutiful young people.

41
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,244
The youth of today will be
the leaders of tomorrow.

42
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,975
Remember, each of you has
to become someone in life.

43
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,051
There are still the likes
of Gautam Buddha..

44
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,416
..Mahavir Swami, and
Lord Ram among you..

45
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,921
Our generation can
still produce..

46
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,083
..Shahid Bhagat Singh, Netaji
and Swami Vivekanand.

47
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:41,924
But to be like them we'll
have to take an oath.

48
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,998
We will face many obstacles
on the way.

49
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:47,261
We are to crush those obstacles
and move forward.

50
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,931
Mr. and Mrs. Samar,
what a couple!

51
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:01,277
Our leader, our guide. He's
become someone's pet!

52
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,122
Run away, Samar, run! Go
away from this trouble.

53
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,453
It is an illusion.

54
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,358
You want
to be some famous man, Samar.

55
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,226
You have to do some great job.

56
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:22,298
No one is able to do anything
after marriage.

57
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,069
Take out that ring.

58
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,664
Now let's see who finds it out.

59
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:08,514
You've lost, Lalaji. Now you'll
remain your wife's servant.

60
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,083
What is the big deal
with that, Divakar?

61
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:17,020
My future is in my hands.

62
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,353
Let me prepare myself a bit..

63
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,757
..then you can make me stand
on the edge of a sword.

64
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,720
The new bride poured oil on her
body and committed suicide.

65
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,721
Don't hurry, Lalaji.

66
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,397
Everyone will ask you the
story in the morning.

67
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,069
You are blushing like
a bride, Lalaji.

68
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,814
Everyone will ask you the
story in the morning.

69
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,822
Pal, I am very lucky
in this matter.

70
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:41,326
Since the day I've married
Kiran, life is peaceful.

71
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:47,170
Besides, if you get an educated
wife, it's total ruin.

72
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,696
Why have I come here?

73
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,823
She neither talked nor welcomed
me.

74
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,595
Isn't this an insult?

75
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,933
Just standing at the window,
is this what she has studied?

76
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,701
Metric pass? Thinks that I
would convince..

77
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:21,934
..her like other men.

78
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,204
That I would flatter her.

79
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,975
Sister, Lalaji is sleeping
on the terrace.

80
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,053
But why?
- What happened?

81
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,391
Looks like they both
have had a quarrel.

82
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,653
But what's the matter?

83
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,664
Is there something wrong with
the girl? - What is the matter?

84
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:48,347
What is it? Don't
you like your wife?

85
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,017
I've come to know that you
didn't even talk to her.

86
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:59,433
Will you speak something or not?

87
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,871
Does one behave like this when
someone comes to our home?

88
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,702
What will she say to her family?

89
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:10,437
Ok, agreed that you
didn't want to marry.

90
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:13,878
But now you are married. How
long can you behave like this?

91
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,381
One has to put up
with one's fate.

92
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:20,386
Think about that girl; she must
be feeling so unfamiliar.

93
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,787
Think yourself to be some
idealistic person?!

94
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,389
Why are you standing here? Go!

95
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,893
What is my fault? I had
refused to get married.

96
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,796
These are my days to study. One
can't study after marriage.

97
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,801
Since the moment
you're married you look..

98
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,996
.. as if all the
troubles of the world were on you.

99
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,404
Such obstacles will keep
coming. Do I care a damn?

100
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,408
Don't fool yourself, Lalaji.
Every one can see this.

101
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,071
You're upset since the morning.

102
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,915
So what if you didn't have
a good first night?

103
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,009
You still have many more nights.

104
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,419
Bhabhi, I can't bear the
arrogance of my own ones.

105
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,855
No matter if one is metric
pass or beautiful.

106
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:03,589
Well, well. Lalaji, even
I don't like this.

107
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:08,098
Prabha is proud of her
education and beauty.

108
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:13,098
If you ask my opinion,
she's not a fairy.

109
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,442
Everyone looks beautiful
when he or she is young.

110
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:19,108
Wasn't I beautiful?

111
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:20,946
If she were really pretty..

112
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,448
..don't
know how snobbish she would be.

113
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,780
She doesn't find me
worth talking to.

114
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,454
She's only brought some books
with her, and nothing else.

115
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:31,452
I had told everyone not to
push me in this trouble.

116
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,958
But you were also obstinate
then, Bhabhi.

117
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,053
You just wanted to
tie me down anyhow.

118
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,529
Speak softly, Lalaji.

119
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,465
Or people will think that I am
teaching you wrong lessons.

120
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,469
What's there to teach? Don't
I understand myself?

121
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,061
Well, come and have the meal.

122
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,073
The photographer might
be coming any moment.

123
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,870
You go and eat. I
don't want to eat.

124
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:53,539
Oh, c'mon! Don't get upset
over trifle matters.

125
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:55,479
Everything will be fine.

126
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,484
I will
make her understand. Come now.

127
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,683
Have you brought it?
- Yes, sister Munni.

128
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,759
Bhabhi, get ready fast.

129
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,837
We're going to the cinema after
shooting the photographs.

130
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,906
Brother, have the meal fast.

131
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,104
We are going to the cinema
for the 3 o'clock show.

132
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,173
Which cinema?
- You all go to the cinema.

133
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,684
Enough now! Come, Lalaji.

134
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,778
It's been many days since
I went to the cinema.

135
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,017
But, Bhabhi, aunt Punno
is coming at 3 o'clock.

136
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:42,529
So how will we go? Let brother
and younger sister in law go.

137
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,692
Yes, Lalaji, you both go to the
cinema. Perhaps that will work.

138
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,532
I won't go. - But we've already
bought the tickets.

139
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,539
Then send Amar.
- Yes, sister. -Shut up!

140
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,940
Brother! - Agree to her,
Lalaji. Prabha won't bite you!

141
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:59,604
Yes, you and Bhabhi
will have to go.

142
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,706
Is everyone ready?
- Lalaji!

143
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,652
See, mother, she's
shut the doors.

144
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,744
Must be sitting beside
the window.

145
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,586
Call her out. I've put
some food on the stove.

146
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,600
You lock the room in the
morning, too! Lalaji is up there.

147
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,335
Come now. The photographer
has come.

148
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,691
Ok, Samar, now you and daughter
in law will stand here.

149
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,693
No, first take a photo of elder
bro and Bhabhi. - Yes.

150
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,894
Now take a photo of brother
Samar and Bhabhi.

151
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,630
Come now, or the food will
get cold. - Yes, mother.

152
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:34,374
Both of you, please, look up.

153
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,173
Why don't you sit properly?
Smile a bit.

154
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,058
Look at his photo!

155
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,654
Wants to shoot a photo and
that, too, with that face.

156
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,728
Hey Samar! I heard that
you got married.

157
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,060
You didn't even tell me.

158
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,328
Have you come to watch the
film? - No.. it's just..

159
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:12,133
Who is she? Your wife.
- No.

160
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,799
Your sister?
- Yes, yes. Ok, I'm going.

161
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,429
Tell me, Lalaji, is everything
working fine?

162
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:50,776
When we went to the cinema the
first time, your brother..

163
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,779
Bhabhi, let me rest; I'm tired.

164
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,850
You're tired in the evening?
You still have the night to go.

165
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:02,447
Well, rest now. I'm going.

166
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:07,952
I had come to tell you that..

167
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:11,122
..Prabha is especially cooking
the lunch tomorrow.

168
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,800
Your brother was praising
her cookery.

169
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,302
She also makes the omelet.

170
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,463
How does he know?

171
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:22,475
He had
eaten that when he went to see her.

172
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,310
He was praising her so much.

173
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,474
You'll find it out tomorrow.

174
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,829
Come, Bhabhi; everyone's come.

175
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:49,494
I'll come soon. Let
Lalaji eat first.

176
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:17,857
What happened? - My foot!
The Dal is like poison!

177
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,933
I don't want to
eat this banquet.

178
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,062
But I had tasted the Dal.

179
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,407
Wears a wristwatch while
cooking the food!

180
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:30,875
What would you do with
a watch in the kitchen?

181
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,378
Wears the sari other way
round in the house.

182
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,050
It happens, brother.

183
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,961
You will have to do with
the one you've married.

184
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:53,397
What would that poor girl do?

185
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,900
Even if she is at fault..

186
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,971
..you should forgive her
at such occasions.

187
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:00,302
It's her farewell after 2 days.

188
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,069
Her brother will
come to take her.

189
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,906
What will she say about
us when she goes home?

190
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,249
Here it is. Take it out.

191
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:17,648
Bhabhi, stay here.
I'll get it out.

192
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,323
I told him to keep the fan
here for 2 -3 days.

193
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:22,521
But he told me that someone's
sick at his home..

194
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,257
..and needs the fan.

195
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:26,526
Everyone was fine till yesterday,
and today they're all ill.

196
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,932
What was the need to
take only the fan?

197
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,526
Tell them to take this
electricity connection, too.

198
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:31,935
Take it off, too.

199
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,007
Now you're irritated
with every thing.

200
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:36,599
If you want me to rest, let
me sleep here peacefully.

201
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,941
Or I'll go to Divakar's or other
friend's house and stay there.

202
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:40,946
Lalaji, you act very
stubborn sometimes..

203
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,016
..and don't listen to anyone.

204
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:47,019
What is this? Listen to
your elders sometimes.

205
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,554
I listened once, and
got this trouble.

206
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,283
What else will I have to bear?

207
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:53,552
You're here, Bhabhi? I looked
for you in the whole house.

208
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,960
I saw you all sitting in
the room, so I came here.

209
00:24:57,063 --> 00:25:00,033
Why didn't you join us? It's
better than this darkness.

210
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,295
Come now. Let's go down.

211
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:05,964
Why don't we sit here for some
time? The breeze is cool here.

212
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,167
Forget this cool breeze,
and come down.

213
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:14,144
It happens, Bhabhi. If you both
behave this way, later on..

214
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:16,978
You know my state, Bhabhi.

215
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,574
Sit down, Munni.

216
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,983
Is he also upset with you..

217
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,315
..since the first night
of your marriage?

218
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:25,984
Forget about me, Bhabhi.
I am unlucky.

219
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:30,154
My brother is very good hearted,
though he may not look so.

220
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:35,998
If you talk to him once,
his anger will be gone.

221
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,594
But I feel shy. What
do I talk to him?

222
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:41,004
You've studied in English.

223
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,406
You
must be knowing how to talk well.

224
00:25:44,444 --> 00:25:47,505
It is not taught in the schools
how to talk to one's husband.

225
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,080
Then I'll teach you.

226
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,180
Just say anything.

227
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,691
Do this, Bhabhi. Brother
is to be given milk now.

228
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,527
I won't take it; you
take it to him.

229
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:07,431
Don't refuse. You will have
to take it, my dear Bhabhi.

230
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,375
Hey! Why did you bring it?

231
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:17,034
Wasn't there
anyone else to do that?

232
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:21,205
Munni is so silly!

233
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:25,050
She shouldn't have let the
new daughter in law work.

234
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,713
Now that you've brought it,
go and give him the glass.

235
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:31,052
Why feel shy?

236
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,388
Bhabhi, what have you thought
for the breakfast.

237
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:39,729
I'm coming. Ask his forgiveness.

238
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,135
After all he is your husband.

239
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:02,411
Forgive me and have this milk.

240
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:22,107
Listen!

241
00:27:57,578 --> 00:28:02,642
Child, take her carefully.
Amar, drop them till the station.

242
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,349
How come the bill
amounts to so much?

243
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,518
I've counted everything
correctly, sir.

244
00:28:46,627 --> 00:28:48,687
A wedding leads to
a good expenditure.

245
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:52,391
Yes, it was a wedding of a
prince! Take it next month.

246
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,542
There are no vegetables again?

247
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:12,280
Well.. Samar's wife has
worn her gold bangles.

248
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:15,379
Gold bangles? Didn't Samar
say anything to her?

249
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:22,222
Samar! Don't know what great
man he takes himself to be!

250
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,558
Doesn't say a word to his wife..

251
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:24,893
..and then roams around
like a fool.

252
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:26,967
Takes this house to be a hotel.

253
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:29,633
It is we who bear
all the trouble.

254
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:36,567
Just wait and watch, Lalaji.
She'll be on the right track soon.

255
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:41,577
Till you keep a woman under
your control, you can't win her.

256
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:48,252
My father used to say that
a woman is a wooden cage.

257
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:50,256
Don't get so attracted
to her...

258
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:52,326
..that you can't think
of anything else.

259
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:56,761
If you wake me up even
at midnight, Lalaji..

260
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:59,662
..I would still add the
right spices in the food.

261
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,268
Now what's the benefit?

262
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:06,272
She's has good education, but
does not know how to cook.

263
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:10,776
Your elder brother had
also had such a wife.

264
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:13,779
She did not care for anyone.

265
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:17,283
But your brother is
a man after all.

266
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,283
He vanished all her
pride in 2 days.

267
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:25,017
Some people are just
like that, Lalaji.

268
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,289
They don't listen unless
you thrash them.

269
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:33,299
Now our Bhabhi is all right.

270
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,892
As soon as she sees anger
in brother's eyes..

271
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,800
..she shivers like a leaf.

272
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:39,839
Let me study now.

273
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,376
I haven't even opened the
books for many days.

274
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,478
He gets killed at the hands of
his father, Rustom, unknowingly.

275
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:49,709
He asks whether he was Rustom.

276
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:52,308
The man answered that
he was not Rustom.

277
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,159
Hey pal! You're roaming here?

278
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:58,094
Why didn't you come
to the college?

279
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:01,174
I don't feel well. - Why do
you look so ill these days?

280
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:04,840
It's nothing. -It's time for
the football match. Come.

281
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:07,244
No, pal, I want to go home.

282
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,174
I also have a wife
at home. C'mon.

283
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:46,336
Couldn't she write
me even a letter?

284
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,003
My wife stayed at my house..

285
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,010
..for 4 days and I didn't
even talk to her.

286
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:53,842
Because I was being married
against my wish.

287
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:58,013
Shucks! Is this a solid
reason to say no?

288
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:08,352
Samar, you are a donkey!
An idiot!

289
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,361
Brother, didn't you talk
to Bhabhi at all? - No.

290
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:23,038
That day at the cinema?
- Give me a glass of water.

291
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:36,720
Brother, will you marry again?

292
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:41,886
Isn't this one enough?
Whom will I marry now?

293
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,389
Who was talking of marriage?
Mother?

294
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:50,065
No, I was just asking like that.

295
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,732
Mother and Bhabhi were talking
after dinner last night..

296
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,810
If this continues, I will
leave this house some day.

297
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,812
Every one is speaking his mind.
Second marriage, eh?

298
00:38:01,848 --> 00:38:04,249
Brother, shall I tell
you something?

299
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:09,016
The excess salt in the Dal that
day, actually elder Bhabhi..

300
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:14,424
I came running to see whether
Lalaji is sitting quiet.

301
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:19,490
Don't know what's wrong. He
doesn't eat properly these days.

302
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,270
Sister Munni, you're so nice.

303
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:26,965
Please, spread these clothes
over the rope.

304
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:40,843
You're leaving so soon?
You are under my oath.

305
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:43,116
Eat the Rotis at least.

306
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:53,864
It's so hot outside. How many
days are left to Diwali, Lalaji?

307
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,799
Around 10
- 15 days.

308
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:03,472
It'll be four months to your
marriage on this Diwali.

309
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:08,806
What a married life
you have, Lalaji!

310
00:39:08,915 --> 00:39:13,478
We had so many hopes;
it's all ruined.

311
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:19,491
They've written to send
someone. - Whom?

312
00:39:19,593 --> 00:39:23,826
Your wife. Now bring her back.
It's been many days.

313
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:30,836
Elder daughter in law is
pregnant. It's her first child.

314
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:37,172
Your mother can't look
after the kitchen now.

315
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:39,246
She's already worked hard.

316
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:43,173
If we have one more person,
it will be a good help.

317
00:39:43,283 --> 00:39:46,344
I won't go, father. Send Amar.

318
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:50,513
Why? Are you scared
of your wife?

319
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:52,456
Is she some lioness
who might eat you?

320
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,858
You are so stubborn!

321
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:58,193
You think you are the best?

322
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:01,525
Don't talk to her all your life.

323
00:40:15,982 --> 00:40:17,883
Listen, Lalaji.

324
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:21,546
Do you know what father was
saying to mother this morning?

325
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:25,049
He was saying that Samar's
wife is coming home.

326
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:28,492
He wants you to go to
some good doctor.

327
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,564
We'll give him whatever
fees he asks for.

328
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:33,224
Why? What's happened to me?

329
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:37,402
Will I have to tell you that?

330
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:41,063
And listen! She is coming; so
keep her under your control.

331
00:40:41,174 --> 00:40:43,905
Or else you'll regret.

332
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:46,644
Younger brother in law has
gone to bring her back.

333
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:10,663
Brother, you both are educated.
- Who both?

334
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,935
You and Bhabhi.
- So? - Bhabhi is coming back.

335
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:19,945
Can't you talk to her and
explain what you want and how?

336
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:24,609
If one explains nicely
to a woman.. - Munni!

337
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:30,950
I am uneducated. But
you and Bhabhi..

338
00:41:31,224 --> 00:41:34,126
Brother, will you
talk to Bhabhi?

339
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:37,030
Go, Munni; go down.

340
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:46,966
Brother Samar, I've brought
Bhabhi back.

341
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:48,302
Can I take your cycle?

342
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:49,501
Come back soon.

343
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:51,134
They've sent her after
much convincing.

344
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:53,577
Bhabhi's family is very bad.
I won't go there again.

345
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,581
Why? What did they say?

346
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:57,651
They just keep saying bad
Things..

347
00:41:57,751 --> 00:41:59,481
..about Bhabhi and mother..

348
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:02,988
Are we all.. - What about me?
- Yes, they all praise you.

349
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:05,490
Praise me? - Not only you;
they praise me, too.

350
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:09,723
I also study very well. -Give
me the cycle. - Hey brother!

351
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:29,068
Welcome Samar! How come
you're here today?

352
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:31,577
How was the match yesterday?

353
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:36,742
You should have seen the final.
It was fantastic; you missed it.

354
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,682
Our players were just superb.

355
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:41,812
They kicked the ball like
that and scored 3 goals.

356
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:44,590
If it were some other girl,
she would have said..

357
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:47,251
..so many bad things about me
to her family and defamed me.

358
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:49,420
She must have told them that..

359
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,089
..I am busy studying as
my exams are approaching.

360
00:43:51,198 --> 00:43:52,689
That's the difference between
an educated..

361
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,267
..and uneducated girl.

362
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:57,167
What's the big problem if she
put some more salt in the Dal?

363
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,502
She was new to the family so
she might have been scared.

364
00:43:59,606 --> 00:44:02,098
If anyone asks me to read
a page in the class..

365
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:04,269
..I would stammer
standing there.

366
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:09,781
Are you listening or not?
- Yes, what were you saying?

367
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:14,120
Why do you look so happy?
What's the matter?

368
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:21,846
Prabha!

369
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:48,214
Brother, do you know
Bhabhi has come?

370
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:50,216
What do I do if she's come?

371
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:58,949
Don't be scared, Lalaji.
It's me.

372
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:03,556
Don't you know Prabha has come?

373
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,888
You've been out since morning.

374
00:47:05,992 --> 00:47:08,894
My exams are approaching,
so I had gone to study.

375
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:11,965
I know that. You're holding
the book upside down.

376
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:15,369
Come; they've sent sweets from
your matrimonial house.

377
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:17,461
Won't you eat it?

378
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:24,976
Bhabhi! - What now? -I.. I will
eat later. I am not hungry now.

379
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,047
Prabha is with mother.
Come on now.

380
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:47,333
O thou men, the air of heaven
is soft and warm and pleasant.

381
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:48,925
But the grave is cold.

382
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:51,664
Heaven's air is better
than the colder grave.

383
00:47:51,772 --> 00:47:53,832
Behold me. I am w..

384
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:11,474
No, Prabha, go and sleep there.

385
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:14,810
Samar's elder brother will
be coming here soon.

386
00:50:15,582 --> 00:50:19,485
Why don't you want to sleep
there? - No, Bhabhi.

387
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:23,816
Why? What's happened to me?

388
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:28,157
Will I have to tell you that?

389
00:50:28,261 --> 00:50:30,230
You shouldn't say that, Prabha.

390
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:31,895
You are a new daughter
in law here.

391
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:34,490
You have the whole life
in front of you.

392
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:38,902
You should agree now. It
happens all the time.

393
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,175
Why would I go there forcibly
and sleep there?

394
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:45,101
He didn't even come to
take me from my home..

395
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:46,839
..and you ask me to go there?

396
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:50,182
He didn't even write
me a letter.

397
00:50:50,617 --> 00:50:53,849
He is appearing for the board
exams. So I won't disturb him.

398
00:50:53,954 --> 00:50:56,856
If something happens,
he'd blame me later.

399
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:01,525
One keeps insulting me, and
I would keep tolerating that?

400
00:51:01,628 --> 00:51:03,529
I can't do that.

401
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,731
Lie down. Why should I care?

402
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:40,562
She must have thought that
she would control me..

403
00:51:40,667 --> 00:51:42,568
..and I would wave my
tail like a pet dog.

404
00:51:42,669 --> 00:51:45,161
I don't even care to ask you
why are you lying down.

405
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:47,570
If you die, we'd get thrown out.

406
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:07,092
No, Lalaji. Your wife has come
once more..

407
00:52:07,194 --> 00:52:09,095
..and you talk like this?

408
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:11,596
Whether she comes one
time or the second..

409
00:52:11,698 --> 00:52:13,667
..why should I care when I have
nothing to do with her?

410
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:19,671
Ok, Lalaji, why are you
so upset with her?

411
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:21,669
I didn't want to marry..

412
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:24,768
..but you all forced this
trouble in my life.

413
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:27,277
And then, I hate her face.

414
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:30,616
Sister Munni always praises her.

415
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:34,015
Mother is not happy with her,
but keeps saying..

416
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:36,613
..that she hasn't seen such a
pretty daughter in law ever.

417
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:39,693
She might not have. I don't see
anything special about her

418
00:52:39,793 --> 00:52:41,785
What are you saying, Lalaji?

419
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:44,626
She's educated, also knows
knitting and sewing..

420
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:46,700
..and can also play
the harmonium.

421
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:49,632
So what if she hasn't brought
along any dowry?

422
00:52:51,738 --> 00:52:54,640
Ok, Lalaji, hand her this duty.

423
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:56,309
As soon as she wakes up in the
Morning..

424
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,639
..give her the harmonium.

425
00:52:57,744 --> 00:53:00,043
At least she would sing.

426
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,981
You're kidding, Bhabhi.

427
00:53:06,086 --> 00:53:08,646
I've cleaned the upper room,
as I want to study there.

428
00:53:08,755 --> 00:53:11,816
Now if you send outsiders
there, how would I study?

429
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:16,397
I will talk to mother, Lalaji.
I can't think of another place.

430
00:53:16,763 --> 00:53:20,256
Talk to mother or brother. I
want a separate place to study.

431
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,394
Let others go to hell.

432
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,106
This is that moment..

433
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:45,208
Bhabhi, give me out here.
I'm wearing shoes.

434
00:55:48,248 --> 00:55:52,310
Bhabhi, why do you bother?
You should rest these days.

435
00:55:52,919 --> 00:55:54,820
Isn't there anyone
else in the house?

436
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:56,412
Munni is an outsider.

437
00:55:56,523 --> 00:55:59,152
Mother and father won't
eat food cooked by her.

438
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:02,819
Prabha is here; but she
is a new daughter in law.

439
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,898
If she has the right to eat..

440
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:07,160
..will we bring people from
the outside to work?

441
00:56:19,946 --> 00:56:22,177
Here, a daughter is
born in the family.

442
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:26,846
Brother, sweeten our mouths.

443
00:56:26,953 --> 00:56:28,854
You've become the eldest uncle.

444
00:57:38,024 --> 00:57:40,255
Bhabhi, make it fast.
I'm getting late.

445
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:45,094
Younger Bhabhi, get the hot
water for baby's bath. Fast.

446
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,334
Where is younger
daughter in law?

447
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:57,934
She's gone to give the bath
water for the baby.

448
00:57:58,044 --> 00:58:00,343
There's no one to
serve you food?

449
00:58:05,252 --> 00:58:07,346
Send my meal down for two
people.

450
00:58:07,454 --> 00:58:09,355
There's a guest with me.

451
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:18,628
I'll make it for you right now.

452
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:24,299
Daughter in law, how long
will this trash lie here?

453
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,978
See? What's the difference..

454
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:38,051
..between our daughter and
the daughter in law?

455
00:58:38,151 --> 00:58:39,483
Our daughter does
not cover her face.

456
00:58:39,586 --> 00:58:40,986
And the daughter in law
also does not care..

457
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:42,385
..where her sari is flying.

458
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:49,051
Did you hear that? Those who
see say that we are ill fated.

459
00:58:49,296 --> 00:58:50,320
On the day of naming the baby..

460
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,331
..we're having the
Satyanarayana Katha.

461
00:58:52,432 --> 00:58:54,663
There will be so many guests.

462
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:56,999
Will you defame us in front
of our caste people?

463
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:21,356
Come and sit here.

464
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:15,412
Hey! What are you doing?

465
01:00:15,516 --> 01:00:17,417
Washing the
utensils with Ganeshji?

466
01:00:17,518 --> 01:00:19,248
Do you have any sense?

467
01:00:19,353 --> 01:00:20,377
Just because we don't
tell you anything..

468
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:21,511
..you shouldn't act freely.

469
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:23,250
To hell with such an education.

470
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:26,088
O Lord Ram! What
will happen now?

471
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,828
If I knew that before..

472
01:00:27,928 --> 01:00:30,261
..I wouldn't have
done that, mother.

473
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:33,161
I thought it is some
normal heap of sand.

474
01:00:33,267 --> 01:00:36,101
Normal heap of sand? Lord Ram!

475
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:41,105
And you dare to answer me back?
Why did you think?

476
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:45,769
Are you blind? Couldn't you see
there was a thread tied to it?

477
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:48,114
Just keeps talking.

478
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:50,116
She never lets anything go
without answering back.

479
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:52,118
What difference will
it make to her..

480
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:53,278
..if something happens
to my child?

481
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,120
O God, save us. Everyone
is watching us.

482
01:00:58,225 --> 01:01:00,126
What happened, Munni?

483
01:01:00,227 --> 01:01:03,129
Your educated wife washed
dirty utensils with the..

484
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,859
..Ganeshji whom the pundit
worshipped today.

485
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:08,464
O God, save my child.

486
01:01:11,405 --> 01:01:13,465
Bastard! If you want to stay
here, stay the right way.

487
01:01:13,574 --> 01:01:17,136
Or else go from here. You think
yourself to be very smart!

488
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:23,349
Child, be careful while working.

489
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:37,220
Are these your ideals? Coward!
Low! You hit a woman!

490
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:39,823
Is this how you will
become a great man?

491
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:53,179
Go and give this
to your brother.

492
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,181
He hasn't come down yet.

493
01:01:55,282 --> 01:01:57,842
Keep it here. He will
come down and drink.

494
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:00,186
Go and give it, Munni.

495
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,866
What's the matter after all?

496
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:32,275
I've decided that I won't
waste any time..

497
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:35,543
..and give all my
time to studies.

498
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:37,277
Pal, tell me what's the matter.

499
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:39,285
I can't study at home.

500
01:03:39,386 --> 01:03:40,877
And there's only a month
left to our exams.

501
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:42,615
I will study here.

502
01:03:42,723 --> 01:03:45,625
I hope you haven't quarreled
with your wife.

503
01:03:49,596 --> 01:03:52,964
Daughter in law, don't you
write any letter to your family?

504
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,631
Your father in law has received
a letter from your father.

505
01:03:55,736 --> 01:03:58,296
He is asking whether you're ill.

506
01:03:58,405 --> 01:03:59,964
What would I write?

507
01:04:00,073 --> 01:04:01,905
You can see, mother, that
everything is fine.

508
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:05,638
Still, child, you should write
sometimes.

509
01:04:05,746 --> 01:04:07,977
They are your parents.

510
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:12,318
He writes that they've
written 5 -6 letters..

511
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:13,648
..but you haven't replied
to a single one.

512
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:15,650
I will write, mother.

513
01:04:15,756 --> 01:04:18,316
And what is this sad face
you wear all the time?

514
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:20,826
When did you wash your hair
last?

515
01:04:20,927 --> 01:04:22,987
Do wash it sometimes, idiot.

516
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:26,662
Must be full of lice. They
might get in the food, too.

517
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:40,123
Mother, I am going.
- Mother, see, Amar is going.

518
01:06:40,233 --> 01:06:42,202
Have the meal first.

519
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:47,971
Is the milk ready, Prabha? It's
time to give it to the baby.

520
01:06:48,575 --> 01:06:49,873
I'll give you right now.

521
01:06:49,976 --> 01:06:53,071
See, she is spilling
the milk here.

522
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,140
Spilled the milk? Very good.

523
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:59,485
As if her father had
gifted us a buffalo.

524
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:02,554
Don't know whether she has
any strength or not.

525
01:07:07,594 --> 01:07:09,995
Tell me, do I let the
child go hungry now?

526
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,899
What a state you've got
this kitchen into!

527
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:18,904
The pan is here; the rolling
pin is rolling over there.

528
01:07:19,005 --> 01:07:21,497
One would feel sick when
one sits here to eat.

529
01:07:21,608 --> 01:07:23,577
She has studied till
standard tenth!

530
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:30,010
It spilled by mistake, mother.
I am boiling some more.

531
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:33,518
She answers me back!

532
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,521
See? She's creating a scene just..

533
01:07:35,622 --> 01:07:37,523
..because she had to work a bit.

534
01:07:37,624 --> 01:07:41,527
Didn't I work? Did I ever
say anything to mother?

535
01:07:41,628 --> 01:07:43,688
Don't indebt me for the
work you've done for me.

536
01:07:43,797 --> 01:07:48,258
I'll repay it with the interest.

537
01:07:48,635 --> 01:07:51,127
Why do you keep bickering
all day long?

538
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:53,206
You get started as
soon as it is day.

539
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,200
Mother, come down. The
laundry man has come.

540
01:07:57,644 --> 01:07:59,545
See that?

541
01:07:59,646 --> 01:08:01,706
Bhabhi, you also go down.
I'll bring the milk.

542
01:08:04,651 --> 01:08:07,052
Why do you interfere
in our matters?

543
01:08:07,153 --> 01:08:09,554
Munni, I won't come
in the night.

544
01:08:09,656 --> 01:08:12,558
My exams are close, so I will
study at Divakar's place.

545
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:14,890
And that..

546
01:08:26,673 --> 01:08:29,575
How much is it for, Bhabhi?
- I don't know.

547
01:08:29,676 --> 01:08:32,236
Father had bought it last year.

548
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,980
It's not working. Don't you k

549
01:08:37,684 --> 01:08:39,983
What for? -Just like that.

550
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:42,578
If
you would need to see the time..

551
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:45,585
When I was there, I used
to check it properly.

552
01:08:45,692 --> 01:08:49,754
I had to go to school on time,
and study at home.

553
01:08:49,863 --> 01:08:51,923
We had to give meal
to father on time.

554
01:08:52,032 --> 01:08:56,265
Brother can also use it. He
is having exams these days.

555
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:58,270
You can also see the time.

556
01:08:59,706 --> 01:09:02,266
Your brother comes
home late at night.

557
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:05,338
Why do I need to check
the time here?

558
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:20,293
Brother was telling me
Yesterday..

559
01:09:20,393 --> 01:09:21,691
..that you've lost weight.

560
01:09:21,795 --> 01:09:25,630
Is she all right?
- Give me the towel.

561
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:27,960
And he was saying..

562
01:09:28,068 --> 01:09:29,798
..that you shouldn't work
hard unnecessarily.

563
01:09:29,903 --> 01:09:31,269
He'd come to the kitchen
Himself..

564
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:32,634
..and have the meal there.

565
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:35,800
Bhabhi, there's a good
movie in the cinemas.

566
01:09:35,909 --> 01:09:40,643
Who'd take us? - He'd taken
you once, after the wedding.

567
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:43,979
Yes, he took me for a drive
in the cart and came back.

568
01:09:44,084 --> 01:09:46,644
You didn't tell me that.
- What would I tell you?

569
01:09:46,753 --> 01:09:49,313
Ok, I'll catch brother.

570
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:53,653
Brother Samar, come up here.

571
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:58,662
Brother's exams are over. What
does he have to do now?

572
01:09:58,765 --> 01:10:00,734
Why did you call him here
without any reason?

573
01:10:00,867 --> 01:10:04,326
Brother, take us to the
cinema this Sunday.

574
01:10:05,772 --> 01:10:08,332
There's still time to Sunday.
- I'll also come this time.

575
01:10:08,775 --> 01:10:12,007
I, you and younger Bhabhi.
Only three of us.

576
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:15,180
Why? Was Prabha asking that?

577
01:10:15,281 --> 01:10:18,683
Yes, she was. You didn't take
her the last time, too. - What?

578
01:10:18,785 --> 01:10:23,189
Tell me, will you take us? Will
you take us, brother? Tell me.

579
01:10:45,812 --> 01:10:48,372
But where had you been
all these days?

580
01:10:48,815 --> 01:10:51,717
We wrote you many letters, but
you didn't reply to a single one.

581
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:53,717
I had gone to your place..

582
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,449
..but heard that you'd left the
house and went to another city.

583
01:10:56,957 --> 01:11:01,122
What do I tell you? I had been
wandering to get a good job.

584
01:11:01,228 --> 01:11:03,720
I've got to go again tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

585
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,390
Will you tell me why Munni
would go tomorrow?

586
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,734
What's his problem?

587
01:11:08,835 --> 01:11:11,737
Did he have
any good job for last two years?

588
01:11:11,838 --> 01:11:13,807
He has come to take Munni back.

589
01:11:13,907 --> 01:11:15,808
After all, he is her husband.

590
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:18,135
He is asking forgiveness.

591
01:11:18,245 --> 01:11:20,271
Says that he will pay what the
caste decides as a fine.

592
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,905
What about that witch?

593
01:11:22,015 --> 01:11:23,916
He's got back to his senses
because of that witch.

594
01:11:24,017 --> 01:11:27,920
She ran away within
4 to 5 months.

595
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:31,753
Don't know where his senses
had gone under her influence.

596
01:11:31,858 --> 01:11:33,759
Had gone to his granny's place.

597
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,920
He's come now as he needs her.

598
01:11:36,029 --> 01:11:37,930
Father, don't send sister Munni.

599
01:11:38,031 --> 01:11:39,829
How can we trust such a man?

600
01:11:39,933 --> 01:11:41,925
He might be influenced
again by someone else.

601
01:11:42,035 --> 01:11:45,767
I won't send my daughter.
She's already aggrieved.

602
01:11:45,872 --> 01:11:48,774
He vows. Looks like he's
come back to senses.

603
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:51,003
One does not do mistakes
all his life.

604
01:11:51,111 --> 01:11:54,275
You're so naïve. Anyone
can convince you.

605
01:11:54,381 --> 01:11:56,179
This is what I don't
like about you.

606
01:11:56,283 --> 01:11:58,946
You don't understand the
situation, and give your opinion.

607
01:11:59,052 --> 01:12:03,183
Listen to others sometimes.
He's come himself after all.

608
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:05,384
This shows that he's
regretting..

609
01:12:05,492 --> 01:12:08,121
..and that he won't
harass her any more.

610
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:11,796
Are we supposed to keep
Munni here all her life?

611
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:14,390
She'll stay at her home
and look after her life.

612
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:16,527
How long are we going
to live anyways?

613
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,130
What is it, Munni? What is it?

614
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:23,409
Tell us, Munni, what's
the matter?

615
01:12:25,112 --> 01:12:32,815
Father, kill me, strangle me,
but don't send me there.

616
01:12:32,919 --> 01:12:36,412
I will die there. Please,
don't send me.

617
01:12:36,923 --> 01:12:41,327
I beg of you. I beg.
Don't send me..

618
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:49,492
What are you doing, child?
Stop crying.

619
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:54,840
We want to see you happy.

620
01:12:54,941 --> 01:12:56,842
We'll
do only what is to your welfare.

621
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:59,338
Don't cry, child.

622
01:13:05,952 --> 01:13:09,184
Don't cry. Don't cry, child.

623
01:13:27,174 --> 01:13:32,613
Brother, please talk to Bhabhi.
She's done no wrong.

624
01:14:02,008 --> 01:14:03,909
Brother is ready, Bhabhi.

625
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:06,241
He'll be taking us to
the cinema on Sunday.

626
01:14:06,346 --> 01:14:09,077
You, brother and me.
Only three of us.

627
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:20,420
We're freed now. If only I
pass, I will bid studies goodbye.

628
01:14:20,527 --> 01:14:23,326
Complete M. A. at least.
- Talking of studies again!

629
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,524
Now I will watch many movies.

630
01:14:25,632 --> 01:14:28,932
It's been many days since I
saw a movie. Is this life?

631
01:14:29,302 --> 01:14:32,602
Ms. Kiran, get us tea.

632
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:34,940
She is also bored.

633
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:37,442
It's been many days since I
took the poor girl to any movie.

634
01:14:37,544 --> 01:14:40,139
What might she think of me?
Must be cursing her luck.

635
01:14:41,047 --> 01:14:43,278
How's your mother?

636
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:47,611
You touched the book again?
Put it down!

637
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:52,281
Come here on time. You'll have
the meal with us after the movie.

638
01:14:52,392 --> 01:14:53,553
All right.

639
01:14:55,328 --> 01:14:59,288
Now only Ms. Kiran will rule.
She was upset some days back.

640
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:01,231
She thought only studies
are important for me.

641
01:15:01,334 --> 01:15:03,166
And she was nothing.

642
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:07,139
So I keep serving
her 24 hours now.

643
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,368
What nonsense do you keep
talking in front of your pals?

644
01:15:10,243 --> 01:15:12,041
Have the tea.

645
01:15:15,415 --> 01:15:18,977
Yes! She's asked
me many a times.

646
01:15:19,085 --> 01:15:21,316
Why don't you ever bring
your wife at our place?

647
01:15:21,421 --> 01:15:24,482
Ms. Kiran, invite them formally.

648
01:15:24,591 --> 01:15:26,321
Only then will he
bring his wife.

649
01:15:26,426 --> 01:15:28,986
Ok, tell me, when will you
bring your wife here?

650
01:15:29,362 --> 01:15:31,991
She's gone to her
maternal house.

651
01:15:32,098 --> 01:15:34,329
When she comes back, I'll
surely bring her here.

652
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:36,994
Ok, I'll leave now.
- Sit for sometime.

653
01:15:46,112 --> 01:15:53,349
Bangles! Bangles! Fancy
bangles! Glass bangles!

654
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:20,704
'We've come to these
intoxicating scenery.'

655
01:17:20,807 --> 01:17:28,510
'Let's forget all our sorrows
in this cool breeze.'

656
01:17:28,615 --> 01:17:32,518
'This is a world of love.'

657
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:36,522
'These dancing woods.'

658
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:50,295
'Look at this path of love.

659
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:54,466
I am silly, I don't
know where it goes.'

660
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:59,309
'I hope I don't get lost in
these woods.

661
01:17:59,413 --> 01:18:02,315
Help me; I am unaware.'

662
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:06,649
'Take me with you
wherever you go.'

663
01:18:06,753 --> 01:18:10,155
'These dancing woods.'

664
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:24,336
'The mountains are covered
with the clouds.'

665
01:18:24,438 --> 01:18:28,341
'Embrace me with love.'

666
01:18:28,442 --> 01:18:32,436
'The rays are spreading
on earth.'

667
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:36,347
'Take me in your arms.'

668
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:40,353
'It is pleasure on all sides.'

669
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:44,186
'These dancing woods.'

670
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:52,199
'We've come to these
intoxicating scenery.'

671
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:37,903
'It is time for the
advertisements of Vividh Bharati.'

672
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:05,334
Divakar!

673
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:12,276
You left at 11 o'clock in the
night and are back so early?

674
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:15,610
Your wife has gone
to her family.

675
01:20:15,716 --> 01:20:17,878
Why are you jealous of the
people who have wives?

676
01:20:17,984 --> 01:20:20,283
I will go.
- Sit down.

677
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:25,888
Go out and have a look,
it's so late.

678
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:28,291
Let it be.

679
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:32,292
Shouldn't we rest for some
time if we get a chance?

680
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:35,631
I have a wife. I'm not like
you. You just don't like to rest.

681
01:20:35,736 --> 01:20:38,296
You must have started studying
some stupid book.

682
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:40,636
No, Divakar, I won't
study further.

683
01:20:40,741 --> 01:20:42,710
If I get some good job,
I'll take it.

684
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:45,311
Did you hear that, Ms. Kiran?

685
01:20:45,412 --> 01:20:47,904
Mr. Samar is saying
a film dialogue.

686
01:20:48,014 --> 01:20:49,505
Come out here.

687
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:54,712
Pal, enjoy life. There's
whole life to do the job.

688
01:20:56,423 --> 01:20:58,915
It's my first cigarette
of the day. - Don't lie.

689
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:00,653
I will complain to mother.

690
01:21:00,761 --> 01:21:02,992
Have you ever seen brother
Samar smoke?

691
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:05,331
Ask Mr. Samar. He was
saying something.

692
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:07,663
Nothing. How did you find
the movie last night?

693
01:21:07,768 --> 01:21:12,331
We had a film at home. Mother
was upset with us.

694
01:21:12,439 --> 01:21:14,999
What will one do
sitting at home?

695
01:21:15,442 --> 01:21:18,742
We went for a movie after two
months, and yet she was upset.

696
01:21:18,845 --> 01:21:19,869
What can we do with that?

697
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,505
Let's go for a movie
again today.

698
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:27,678
Not a movie. An exhibition
is going on; we'll go there.

699
01:21:27,854 --> 01:21:30,517
Heard that? - Please, let's go.
- And what about mother?

700
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,525
You convince her.

701
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:35,858
You also come with us.
- Shall I take a cigarette now?

702
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:10,390
Didn't you find any other
place to clean the Dal?

703
01:22:10,497 --> 01:22:13,057
Do you have to sit at the
window to clean the Dal?

704
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,992
Why do you go about like
an inauspicious person?

705
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:18,004
Whom do you wait for over there?

706
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:20,574
Tell us, who do you
look for over there?

707
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:27,072
Here, mother. Why do you get
tensed? - What else can I do?

708
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,409
Her husband does
not look at her..

709
01:22:28,515 --> 01:22:29,574
..because of this
behavior of hers.

710
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:32,585
We're stuck. We can neither
accept her nor get rid of her.

711
01:22:34,855 --> 01:22:40,089
You're so silly! How long will
you keep hearing bad words?

712
01:25:41,708 --> 01:25:48,114
Brother, please talk to Bhabhi.
She's done no wrong.

713
01:25:55,922 --> 01:25:58,949
Brother, please talk to Bhabhi.

714
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:08,964
Brother, please talk to Bhabhi.
She's done no wrong.

715
01:26:45,038 --> 01:26:47,337
What are you doing here
so late in the night?

716
01:26:58,785 --> 01:27:01,687
It's too late. Cry in the
morning if you want to.

717
01:27:04,825 --> 01:27:08,023
What difference does it make
to you? You go and sleep.

718
01:27:08,795 --> 01:27:12,698
It's been six months. Have
you ever worried about me?

719
01:27:12,799 --> 01:27:16,861
So what's the need now?
Go and sleep.

720
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:48,068
Prabha, are you upset with me?

721
01:27:48,168 --> 01:27:50,728
Prabha, are you upset with me?

722
01:27:59,012 --> 01:28:03,746
Prabha! - Tell me, what
wrong have I done to you?

723
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:05,751
What crime have I done?

724
01:28:05,852 --> 01:28:11,257
If you don't like me, strangle
me. I won't even sigh.

725
01:28:11,358 --> 01:28:15,090
But do tell me. Tell me,
please. Tell me!

726
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:46,121
Shall I ask you something?

727
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:51,461
Why were you crying up here?

728
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:56,961
Prabha, tell me.

729
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:03,876
Forget it. It's no use
repeating those matters again.

730
01:29:10,183 --> 01:29:13,813
Tell me, Prabha. I've been
asking you since long.

731
01:29:17,924 --> 01:29:22,157
What's the big deal if you ask
me after harassing me so much?

732
01:29:29,202 --> 01:29:31,899
I tolerated insults
for so many days.

733
01:29:32,005 --> 01:29:34,839
I haven't brought dowry,
gifts, or clothes.

734
01:29:34,941 --> 01:29:37,001
I am bad and an idiot.

735
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:40,239
But no one had doubted my
character till now.

736
01:29:40,347 --> 01:29:42,248
But today mother..

737
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:48,445
I felt like burning myself
up like that new bride.

738
01:29:59,132 --> 01:30:02,864
Now shall I ask, too?
- Don't say anything, Prabha.

739
01:30:02,969 --> 01:30:05,461
I know everything.
- Tell me what have I done.

740
01:30:05,572 --> 01:30:09,270
No one has done anything.
I, you or anyone else.

741
01:30:09,976 --> 01:30:14,038
Don't know whose mistake it
was. Perhaps it was mine.

742
01:30:14,247 --> 01:30:16,546
But forget whatever
has happened, Prabha.

743
01:31:30,056 --> 01:31:32,025
Please, get me a postcard.

744
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:35,027
It's been many days since I
wrote a letter to my family.
