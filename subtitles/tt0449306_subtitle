1
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,735
Dear Priya, it's me

2
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:43,405
And this is the bucket that
I'd started filling with my tears...

3
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,341
two months ago, while leaving
my friends in Delhi

4
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:50,450
It's filled now

5
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:55,084
Why did Papa have to take up a job
with the Indian Embassy?

6
00:01:56,126 --> 00:01:59,562
Every year they have him transferred,
from one embassy to another

7
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:02,297
This time it is Russia

8
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:18,047
Know what? The mornings here
are so cold that...

9
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:21,315
my teeth wrestle with each other

10
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:26,214
The things we used to eat on our way
to school, back in India!

11
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,387
Nandulal's "kachoris"...

12
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:30,555
Karim Lala's "falooda"...

13
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:34,627
In Russia, we find milkshakes,
no faloodas...

14
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,063
rosous, no kachoris...

15
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:44,305
Priya, this city seems to have
no houses at all

16
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:49,534
And the buildings here
look more like palaces

17
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:54,480
But looking at the brighter side
of the life...

18
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:57,086
Now that I'm here...

19
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,081
it seems like a Disney Magical
Adventure city to me

20
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:03,826
There's a forest on the way...

21
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,695
and a small pond
inside the forest

22
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:10,594
Every morning, my sister Lucky throws
bread-crumbs at the ducks in the pond

23
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:15,536
Remember, in India, my sister Lucky
always used to be immersed in...

24
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:21,533
well, well... her thoughts,
her poems and her books

25
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:25,046
Here, her plight seems
to have worsened...

26
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:28,043
now she sings religious hymns too!

27
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:31,385
My sister Lucky!
Meera in Russia

28
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:34,282
found it!

29
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:36,558
Found what?

30
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,321
Lucky

31
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,657
Your name is Lucky.
How come that's Lucky?

32
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,503
Oh no, it's a four-leaf clover.
They say, it brings good luck

33
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,667
You mean, it'll help me clear
my examinations?

34
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:57,206
Sure. But it is effective only once

35
00:03:57,781 --> 00:04:00,750
If I find one like that, I'll pass
the examinations this time...

36
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:04,018
and give Papa a surprise.
- Then take this one

37
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:05,354
Really?

38
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:11,357
I need it more than you do,
because you pass every year

39
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:13,355
Thank you, sis

40
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:15,086
Okay... okay

41
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,363
Now shall we?

42
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:20,035
Why do we've to go
to school every day?

43
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,470
"Priya, there are three Indian girls
in Lucky's class"

44
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,447
"But in my class,
all of them are foreigners"

45
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:36,381
"I haven't made a single friend yet"

46
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,255
"I miss my India everyday"

47
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,217
Really, I miss India so much

48
00:04:56,172 --> 00:05:01,371
The Volkswagen VWPD for motion
as a potent PDI PD130 engine

49
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:05,010
The Ferrari Enzo is a successor
to the f40...

50
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,479
To the f50. Does 0.60...

51
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,413
in 2.6 seconds, which makes it
the fastest car in the world

52
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:13,018
Sunaina, you are best.
- Thank you, darling

53
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,518
Sunaina, how do I look?
- Like shit!

54
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:20,561
Sunaina, we have a test tomorrow
in school

55
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:23,555
And what is this that
the two of you are reading?

56
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:29,038
You study for the school test,
while I study for the "cool" test

57
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:32,475
When he comes, he'll find that
our thoughts match

58
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:35,044
Who is coming?

59
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,048
Girls, just guess

60
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,646
No way

61
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:44,713
Don't tell me he's coming!

62
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:47,215
Is it a dream?
- Should I pinch you?

63
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,050
I'll be meeting him
after three years

64
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,395
The last time he came...

65
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,797
he didn't even cast a glance at me

66
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:57,730
Those dirty braces spoiled my smile

67
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:01,665
But now...
- smashing seventeen!

68
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,008
I was also a bit plump then

69
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,574
But...

70
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:10,205
now...

71
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,009
This time he'll turn around for sure,
and also admire his new girlfriend

72
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:21,023
But who is he?
- Hush

73
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:25,451
When everyone is asleep at night, I'll
quietly dress up and go to meet him

74
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:29,424
He will be waiting for me!
He'll come for me...

75
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:33,035
and lost in his eyes,
I'll be a little nervous

76
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:36,037
He'll grab my hand and say,
"come closer"

77
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,040
I'll comply. At some noise,
I'll hug him, out of fright

78
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:42,635
Ah, someone might see us!

79
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,639
Then he'll bring his lips
closer to mine and say...

80
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:48,549
"Give me a kiss, honey".
And then...

81
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:50,575
And then?

82
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:53,389
You tell me. What would you do?

83
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,322
What do I say? I don't even know
who you are talking about

84
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,529
I know what this bore will tell.
What say, Padma?

85
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:06,991
Right. She will say,
"The moon appears so near, no?"

86
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:14,340
"Know what? The moon is 384404
kilometers away from the earth"

87
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:16,703
"I learnt that in school"

88
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:20,276
Really?

89
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:23,152
I'd say something else

90
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,377
"Good Lord"

91
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,274
"Oh my God"

92
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,313
"Why is my heart..."

93
00:07:57,887 --> 00:08:00,048
"hysteric?"

94
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:04,994
"Someone will come,
take me in his arms..."

95
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:08,158
"and kiss my lucky lips"

96
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:29,010
"I feel ticklish..."

97
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:33,345
"I'm lost..."

98
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,015
"I'm half-awake, half-asleep"

99
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:44,690
"It's an entirely all-new feeling"

100
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:48,487
"A thirst lingers on my lips"

101
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:51,693
"It's a special sense of pain"

102
00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:58,739
"someone will leave..."

103
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,698
"with a restless feeling..."

104
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:03,307
"after seeing my lucky lips"

105
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:56,098
"I'm soaring with the breeze..."

106
00:10:57,133 --> 00:11:00,102
"in my obsession"

107
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:04,369
"My eyes, downcast and coy..."

108
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:09,208
"my breaths reveal my story"

109
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,519
"My heart thumps wildly..."

110
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:20,282
"and my lucky lips yearn"

111
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,065
"Good Lord"

112
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:35,400
"Oh my God"

113
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:40,075
"Why is my heart..."

114
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:42,535
"hysteric?"

115
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:48,072
"Someone will come,
take me in his arms..."

116
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:50,748
"and kiss my lucky lips"

117
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:26,055
But who's coming?

118
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,457
Adi.
- Adi?

119
00:12:29,092 --> 00:12:30,582
Adi, who?

120
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:32,721
Ambassador Sekhri's son

121
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,721
Oh Lucky! He's so dashing...

122
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:37,689
so charming...
- so manly

123
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:43,236
If he's so dashing and manly, why'd
he be interested in a school girl?

124
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:47,465
Please! You are just jealous.
Okay?

125
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,505
When he comes, just watch
how I floor him

126
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:54,478
Girls...

127
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:04,018
Sunaina, sorry

128
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:09,361
Sunaina, you won't believe
what blunder I've committed

129
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:12,030
Now what?
- Tomorrow is the Geography test

130
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:16,035
And I misread the timetable
and studied history

131
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:22,036
How could you be so foolish?
- I got to study the entire syllabus

132
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,241
The entire syllabus?

133
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:28,042
Lucky darling, you're going to fail,
I can guarantee that

134
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,248
I'll hang up now, bye

135
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:38,722
Lucky, they will be singing hymns
all night tomorrow at Sunaina's

136
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:45,060
I don't want you to be looking
like a ghost there

137
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:49,067
Know what? All the Indians
will be there

138
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:56,078
Listen... I've packed your bag

139
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:00,412
Lingerie, toothbrush
...I've put everything

140
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:03,581
Ma, please let me study

141
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:07,354
Where's Dhara?
- In the bathroom

142
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:12,691
I don't know what to do
with this girl!

143
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:17,196
If she flunks this time,
your papa will be really angry

144
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,694
Besides, he's so hassled these days

145
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,767
Why? What happened to Papa?

146
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:26,705
Nothing

147
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:31,142
said, there's some official problem

148
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:35,447
People are on the streets,
rioting

149
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,054
Anyway, we've nothing to do with it

150
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,056
Here... your bag is packed

151
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:51,056
Dhara, make it fast!
- Two minutes, Ma

152
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:57,071
Lucky, sleep for a while, dear.
Get up early in the morning and study

153
00:14:58,107 --> 00:14:59,074
Mom

154
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:04,369
Go to sleep, dear,
or you will fall sick

155
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,703
It's seven!
Why didn't the alarm buzz?

156
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:39,371
Get up, Dhara!

157
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,509
Let me sleep, sis.
It's only 2

158
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:45,246
It's 7! Get up, quick

159
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:50,324
No good waking up,
I'm going to flunk anyway

160
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,725
Get up!

161
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,398
Hush, sis! Someone is sleeping here

162
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,572
c'mon get up, you dumbo!

163
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:11,343
Stop it, sis

164
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:34,503
Bye, Dhara.
- Papa's on the line, Lucky

165
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:38,301
I love you

166
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,379
Good morning, dear.
Prepared to come first, aren't you?

167
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,049
Papa...
- What happened?

168
00:16:47,516 --> 00:16:49,643
Mr. Negi...
- Hang on, dear. Yes, sir

169
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,781
My son Aditya is arriving
from Paris today

170
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:56,716
His car's number is 0267 xP78. Please
see he has no problems with security

171
00:16:57,093 --> 00:16:58,720
sure.
- I'll be busy in a meeting

172
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:01,063
That's why I can't receive him

173
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:03,999
He's not coming by flight, sir?

174
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,998
He can dump his father,
but not his car

175
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,997
Wherever he goes, he goes in his car.
He's driving down

176
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,536
Okay, sir

177
00:17:12,475 --> 00:17:14,500
Yes, dear.
- Yes, papa

178
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:18,013
Best of luck, dear. I'm sure
you'll come first this time too

179
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,609
Bye, dear

180
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:24,019
Please help me. Please, God!

181
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:31,618
Perform a miracle, Lord!
Let the exams be postponed

182
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,802
I'm sure you will come first, dear

183
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:43,196
first... first... first

184
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:46,236
Papa is too much.
I'm only human

185
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:49,043
so what if I fail once?

186
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:58,383
I'm forgetting all that I studied

187
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,490
Oh, God!

188
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:13,667
A flat tire! Now!
I won't have time to study now

189
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:32,354
Hey

190
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:34,020
Hi

191
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,558
No Russian

192
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,157
English?

193
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:41,552
Flat tire?

194
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,030
Help?
- No. It's okay

195
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,028
No... no. Wait

196
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:49,371
Wait

197
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:01,049
No school today?

198
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,991
I'll fix it.
- No

199
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,218
My cycle?

200
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,791
Rest?

201
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,200
Vice caption

202
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,597
Just leave me.
No!

203
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:06,603
No! No leave me

204
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,051
Help!

205
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:55,079
Thief

206
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:38,126
Good morning

207
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:47,669
I'm giving you. You aren't
missing your flight, are you?

208
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:04,680
Thank you

209
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,702
Yeah! Nothing.
- Sure

210
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:33,040
Nothing

211
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,208
check

212
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:48,062
What the hell you are doing
in my car? No English?

213
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,796
What are you doing in my car?

214
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,674
Hang on, brother

215
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:02,668
Miss? School bus miss?

216
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:09,416
No Russian, no Spanish,
no Hindi

217
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:11,309
I'm screwed

218
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:19,623
I know Hindi

219
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:24,132
Indian?

220
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:31,569
Indian passport please?

221
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,270
No passport?

222
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:29,688
Watch out

223
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,521
stay inside, I'll be back

224
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:07,996
c'mon wake up.
C'mon get up

225
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:09,998
c'mon

226
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:12,330
Drive. You drive

227
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:15,199
What are you doing? Drive

228
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,268
What the? Drive

229
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:21,476
Drive!

230
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:22,710
Drive!

231
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:28,516
Stop!

232
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:30,678
Stop! Hey, stop!

233
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:58,444
Bullets flying
through such huge guns...

234
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,041
an elephant-like tank speeds
towards my car...

235
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:04,376
and I blast my tonsils screaming, but
it hardly makes any difference to you

236
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,478
Drive!

237
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:08,990
Drive!

238
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:12,686
Drive! I say, drive!

239
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:16,164
What were you thinking of?

240
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,193
What?

241
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:22,003
I can't drive

242
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:45,686
Oh God! Take care of Adi

243
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:55,069
sir

244
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,264
All the phone lines are dead.
Only one choice left

245
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,708
I'll go with the security squadron
to search for Adi

246
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:02,371
No

247
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:05,413
Unless...

248
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:09,380
I get an assessment on the situation
in the city...

249
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:12,379
I won't allow anyone to step out
of the embassy

250
00:30:15,257 --> 00:30:18,420
Before the communication lines
jammed, we taped the BBC broadcast

251
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:21,062
There's no news
on the situation otherwise

252
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:23,626
Play it quickly.
- Mr. Negi...

253
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,401
This is terrible

254
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:34,735
The terrorists have started attacking
in the open. Now what, sir?

255
00:30:35,844 --> 00:30:37,812
Where's the President? Any news?
- No, sir

256
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:40,744
We hear, ministers have
been kidnapped

257
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:45,149
The army is working out a strategy to
tackle the terrorists. War is brewing

258
00:30:46,188 --> 00:30:47,746
Oh my God!

259
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,894
I hope my Adi is safe and all right

260
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:18,711
It's a graveyard.
- Hey school girl, come in front

261
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:22,385
I might look like one,
but I'm not your chauffeur

262
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:28,487
I know it's a graveyard. But,
you know what's special about it?

263
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:33,056
We are three feet
above the ground now

264
00:31:33,468 --> 00:31:36,437
If we drive further,
we'll come back right here

265
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,073
But then...

266
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,504
we'll be six feet under the ground

267
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:46,547
Then you won't be asking questions
and I won't be answering any

268
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:52,084
Now let me find out what problems
those people fighting out there have

269
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:13,700
It's got old. Would you please
open that door?

270
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:18,042
Hang on

271
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,271
Before you break it, let me try

272
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,048
Well, what's the name of the girl
who's sitting in my car?

273
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:27,714
My name is Lucky

274
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,055
I'm sorry.
Are you hurt?

275
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,057
What were you saying?
- I said, my name is Lucky

276
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:37,595
Pardon? Lucky?

277
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:49,440
Listen... seriously, are you Lucky?

278
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:52,246
Lucky Negi

279
00:32:56,151 --> 00:33:00,485
Hear that? The girl with whom I've
spent the luckiest day of my life...

280
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:03,015
happens to be Lucky Negi

281
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:06,027
How will I reach home?

282
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:12,192
I will reach you home... wouldn't you
like to know my name?

283
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:18,039
I'm Aditya Sekhri

284
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,546
shake hands

285
00:33:27,282 --> 00:33:30,718
Don't worry, I'm not going to accept
that hand forever

286
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:34,388
Good

287
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,054
Now how about getting down to work?
- Work?

288
00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:40,594
Yes.
- What work?

289
00:33:42,464 --> 00:33:44,432
You want to go home, don't you?

290
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,591
And your mummy isn't coming here
to fix the radio

291
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:50,734
so we got to do something.
Let's start?

292
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:52,732
Come

293
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:57,678
There are about 3000 Indians in this
area. And it is our prime duty...

294
00:33:58,113 --> 00:33:59,740
to protect all of them
- Mr. Sinha

295
00:34:00,148 --> 00:34:02,343
sir, we've begun the task
of bringing them to the embassy

296
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,017
Good. Any problems on the way?
- No, sir

297
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:09,357
No harm yet to the vehicles
carrying the Indian tricolor

298
00:34:09,724 --> 00:34:11,589
That's very good.
Let's hope that it stays like that

299
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,550
Excuse me, sir

300
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:16,360
Your wife wants to see you.
It's urgent

301
00:34:16,831 --> 00:34:19,299
I'm busy. Tell her, I'll see her
in ten minutes

302
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:20,568
Okay, sir

303
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:24,230
Lucky...
- What happened to Lucky?

304
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,370
Lucky hasn't returned
from school yet

305
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:28,642
Anjali!

306
00:34:32,147 --> 00:34:33,614
Right... right

307
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:37,376
No! Left

308
00:34:38,086 --> 00:34:40,054
Left... left

309
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:41,422
Right

310
00:34:41,756 --> 00:34:43,553
I mean, the left was right

311
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:46,559
stay put

312
00:34:57,505 --> 00:34:58,733
What news?

313
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:00,866
Stay there, I'll tell you

314
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,005
Look Ms Lucky...

315
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,512
see this... we are in Russia

316
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:14,182
There's a clash between the government
and the terrorists

317
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:19,557
What all areas are under attack?
- We are here

318
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:24,564
They are fighting here, here,
here... everywhere

319
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:27,534
Adi...
- Yes?

320
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:30,037
A bee.
- Kill it, or it'll sting you.

321
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:32,206
It'll hurt.
- Kill it!

322
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:38,045
Are you a fool?
What is with you?

323
00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:44,047
Damn these school girls!

324
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:08,531
I know, I was harsh.
Okay, I'm going

325
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:11,011
c'mon, I'm going!

326
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,375
How sweet!

327
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:52,519
I'm hurt, but it is you
who is crying

328
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:57,515
Did you meet your boyfriend
when you were crying?

329
00:36:58,092 --> 00:36:59,719
I don't have a boyfriend

330
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:02,061
Really? You're lying

331
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:06,430
All right, if you don't have
a boyfriend, would you tell me...

332
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:09,333
who gave you these "hicci"?

333
00:37:10,038 --> 00:37:13,667
Hiccups?
- Not hiccups, "hicci"

334
00:37:16,044 --> 00:37:18,012
Know what a love-bite is?

335
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:25,008
Strange. When I was in school
we used to call love-bites "hicci"

336
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:31,014
I don't know what they're called
these days. Whatever, but I'm sure...

337
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:35,420
your boyfriend gave you that.
- I don't have a boyfriend

338
00:37:36,064 --> 00:37:39,033
And may God never give me one!

339
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:45,200
I just asked God for a miracle,
because I didn't want to fail the exam

340
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:52,035
But then, my bicycle's tire went flat,
and then I met that filthy man...

341
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:57,040
who told me he'd fix my tire.
But he tugged at my hair...

342
00:37:58,086 --> 00:38:00,054
Tugged at your hair?
Why didn't you hit him?

343
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,388
I did?
- How?

344
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:04,992
With my lunch box

345
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:09,656
very good, Lucky

346
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:14,598
Tell me... how did you
get into my car?

347
00:38:15,703 --> 00:38:19,332
The door was locked.
- Right. How did you unlock it?

348
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:22,339
I tried using the cutter

349
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,275
cutter? You keep a cutter
with you, eh?

350
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:28,014
Paper cutter

351
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:35,022
And it unlocked?
- No

352
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,018
Then?
- I used the compass

353
00:38:40,428 --> 00:38:42,487
And it gave in?
- No

354
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:47,533
I got it. Then you shoved the compass
as well as the divider...

355
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:51,402
into the lock and broke it. Right?
- Right

356
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,500
But it took all my strength

357
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:01,306
Had you waited two more minutes,
I'd have come and rescued you

358
00:39:03,017 --> 00:39:04,416
I don't have...

359
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:08,485
Pardon? If you could talk
a little louder...

360
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,389
a normal man like me
would hear you

361
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:17,392
I don't have a boyfriend.
I'm not those types

362
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,598
Please believe me

363
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:30,339
I've heard that several times before

364
00:39:38,052 --> 00:39:40,350
But I believe you

365
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:43,518
Let's go

366
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,521
shall we?

367
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:54,030
Adi, are we going home?
- We'll have to take the same way back

368
00:39:54,402 --> 00:39:58,031
And you know the situation.
Dead phones, dead radio...

369
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,703
Do you have grandparents?
- No, they are dead

370
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:03,643
Would you like to meet them?
You wouldn't, right?

371
00:40:04,145 --> 00:40:06,045
So we'll have to stay here

372
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:09,646
Thank you.
- What for?

373
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:12,052
I saw you thrash him

374
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:15,385
Tell me...

375
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:19,718
was that lunch box empty? Or full?

376
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:22,729
Actually, I couldn't
reach school, so...

377
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:28,057
What's this?
A hotel inside a school bag!

378
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,664
Come here... I'm famished

379
00:40:31,105 --> 00:40:32,663
This way, please

380
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:37,467
Official sources say that,
as of now...

381
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:41,406
the fight between the government and
the rebels has come to a stop

382
00:40:41,816 --> 00:40:47,777
Indefinite curfew has been imposed
in the central city and the suburbs

383
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:52,088
citizens are requested
not to step out of their houses

384
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:56,356
Wonderful!

385
00:40:57,198 --> 00:41:00,099
Thank God I don't eat such food
everyday. Because if I did...

386
00:41:00,468 --> 00:41:03,028
I'd not be like this,
I'd be a fatso

387
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:05,698
Your mother cooked it, right?

388
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:08,641
Ask me how I know

389
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:13,204
How?
- Because every mummy cooks yummy food

390
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:18,484
Won't you eat?
- I hope they won't mind

391
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:20,713
They? Who?

392
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:23,317
They

393
00:41:24,158 --> 00:41:26,058
They? Who?
- They

394
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:29,263
Who? Who's here?

395
00:41:30,097 --> 00:41:33,464
I mean, we're sitting on a grave
with food...

396
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,401
it feels bad

397
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,067
I see. One second

398
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:45,409
Peter. 1903

399
00:41:46,113 --> 00:41:49,082
The poor guy has been sleeping here
since 1903

400
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:53,511
He himself doesn't know when he died.
I don't think he'll get up...

401
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:57,557
and say, "Hello. I'm Peter.
When I was alive..."

402
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,423
"my favorite dish used to be
Indian. Potato pancakes"

403
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:08,025
still, if you insist,
I'll invite him for dinner. Okay?

404
00:42:09,837 --> 00:42:13,034
Peter, I'm Aditya Sekhri.
And she is Lucky Negi

405
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,703
Nice to meet you.
We want you to dine with us

406
00:42:17,445 --> 00:42:20,039
The food will be great, guaranteed

407
00:42:20,448 --> 00:42:23,042
If you still have those fingers,
you will chew them up too

408
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,383
Because the food comes
from Lucky Inn

409
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,722
chicken, or potatoes,
pizza or bread...

410
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:32,057
you're welcome to Lucky Inn,
even if you are dead

411
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:40,767
I'm to funny

412
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:46,503
Well? Wasn't I funny?
I think I wasn't

413
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:50,077
Well, I'm thirsty. I'll get water
from the jeep

414
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:53,071
No, I have water here.
No need to go anywhere

415
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,415
so hurry up

416
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,612
One minute...

417
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,327
Not water, it's only a sip of water

418
00:43:08,062 --> 00:43:10,292
Give it back if you don't want.
- I'm drinking

419
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:18,037
Looks like you'll have to spend
the night with me. Know what?

420
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:21,466
Girls would do anything
for such an opportunity

421
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:24,711
I know. The girls in my school...

422
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,707
are willing to do anything
for this opportunity

423
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:31,545
The girls in your school
are still talking about me?

424
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:37,517
Not bad!
I'm not history yet!

425
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:43,528
Look, I belong to a well to do
family, so the front seat is mine

426
00:43:44,098 --> 00:43:48,057
You take the backseat.
And here's your blanket

427
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:18,430
What happened, Lucky? Why are you
making noises under the blanket?

428
00:44:24,405 --> 00:44:27,033
I've never spent a night
away from home

429
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:30,703
I'm scared

430
00:44:33,748 --> 00:44:37,377
If it's because you are spending
the night with me...

431
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:40,387
don't be afraid at all

432
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:44,491
Because I'm not those types

433
00:44:47,528 --> 00:44:49,052
Trust me

434
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:53,061
Adi...

435
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:57,204
I trust you

436
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:02,500
Thank you, Ms Lucky Negi

437
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:06,609
Go to sleep

438
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:37,702
"come and hold me in your arms..."

439
00:45:38,746 --> 00:45:41,044
"I implore you"

440
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:45,715
"I'm dying, my love"

441
00:45:56,163 --> 00:46:00,532
"come and take me in your arms..."

442
00:46:01,102 --> 00:46:03,332
"for my sake"

443
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:08,003
"I'm dying, my love"

444
00:46:18,385 --> 00:46:21,479
"come and take me in your arms..."

445
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,024
"for my sake"

446
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:31,022
"I'm dying, my love"

447
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:04,324
"Love is amazing"

448
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:08,331
"Wonderful things, my eyes behold"

449
00:47:09,403 --> 00:47:12,998
"Until yesterday
my heart was mine..."

450
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,002
"now it belongs to you"

451
00:47:17,044 --> 00:47:19,274
"An unusual desire..."

452
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:22,675
"appeals"

453
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:27,549
"I've spent every moment..."

454
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:30,353
"suffering in pain"

455
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:33,693
"Look..."

456
00:47:35,129 --> 00:47:39,031
"look, don't..."

457
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:42,031
"torment me anymore"

458
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:47,032
"I'm dying, my love"

459
00:48:12,032 --> 00:48:14,330
"Alluring naiveté"

460
00:48:15,703 --> 00:48:17,671
"Amazing intoxication"

461
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,570
"To you..."

462
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:25,478
"I now give my life"

463
00:48:26,714 --> 00:48:29,012
"Amazing reality"

464
00:48:30,351 --> 00:48:32,751
"What a story"

465
00:48:34,054 --> 00:48:36,545
"Beside me..."

466
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:40,356
"stands the princess of my dreams"

467
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:42,719
"No more..."

468
00:48:45,065 --> 00:48:48,466
"no more can I bear..."

469
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:51,701
"this grief of separation"

470
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,437
"I'm dying, my love"

471
00:48:59,747 --> 00:49:03,649
"I'm dying, my love"

472
00:49:30,778 --> 00:49:33,269
Betrayal! D'you intend to
elope with Peter?

473
00:49:33,747 --> 00:49:36,011
Look Lucky, please don't do this

474
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:39,486
I can't live without you.
I'll die without you!

475
00:49:40,321 --> 00:49:45,088
I beg of you, please don't dump me

476
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:55,030
Now stop dreaming about Peter,
it's too late in the night

477
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,039
come and sleep, Ms Lucky Negi

478
00:50:08,082 --> 00:50:10,448
But sir, who's this man?

479
00:50:12,086 --> 00:50:14,714
Should be coming any moment.
See for yourself

480
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:20,052
Only this person can find
Adi and Lucky

481
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:22,395
Greetings.
- Greetings

482
00:50:22,763 --> 00:50:24,731
Any news of Lucky?

483
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,067
Anjali...

484
00:50:55,496 --> 00:51:00,866
Hello, hi... no need
for such formalities

485
00:51:03,504 --> 00:51:06,029
If I am not mistaken,
you are the girl's father

486
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,633
Right... but how do you know?

487
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:11,044
That dejected look...

488
00:51:11,745 --> 00:51:14,043
and those dried up tears...

489
00:51:14,515 --> 00:51:17,313
under your eyes
reveal your identity

490
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:26,821
Handkerchief... wipe off those
tears and distress

491
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:35,729
A great man said, "Tears are nothing
but salty water. Wipe them off"

492
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:42,236
No Mr. Negi, I'm not mad

493
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:48,440
And you can confirm that
with the Ambassador

494
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:55,782
My hand... four fingers and a thumb

495
00:51:57,825 --> 00:52:04,731
Kidnapping, robbery, bribery,
rape and murder

496
00:52:07,568 --> 00:52:11,026
I've spent 17 years with
the Intelligence service

497
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:14,707
I've come across all kinds
of criminals

498
00:52:18,145 --> 00:52:22,377
clench the fist...

499
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:32,048
and there's no criminal activity

500
00:52:38,098 --> 00:52:42,057
Pindi Das Kapoor's fist
has never opened...

501
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,338
nor can anyone open it

502
00:52:47,107 --> 00:52:50,508
sir.
- I trust you completely

503
00:52:52,179 --> 00:52:54,739
These are the pictures
of Aditya and Lucky

504
00:52:56,116 --> 00:53:00,644
They are missing.
And we fear they might have...

505
00:53:01,121 --> 00:53:02,349
fear?

506
00:53:04,091 --> 00:53:09,358
What for? As long as a person
is missing, he is alive

507
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:17,697
If this can relieve you a bit,
then let me tell you that...

508
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:23,475
your daughter's bicycle has been
found, in the forest near the school

509
00:53:24,144 --> 00:53:26,704
And Lucky? Any news of her?

510
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:35,054
Belongs to her

511
00:53:48,502 --> 00:53:50,060
A great man once said...

512
00:53:51,238 --> 00:53:53,798
"No boundary, no power on earth
can stop me..."

513
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:57,071
"from uniting a mother
and her daughter"

514
00:54:54,568 --> 00:54:56,536
Ms Lucky, tell me something

515
00:54:58,438 --> 00:55:01,999
Did you have a premonition
of the war? You are fully prepared

516
00:55:03,777 --> 00:55:08,009
I hope you aren't a KGB agent?
- I was going to stay at Sunaina's

517
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:10,183
That's why I had packed my bags

518
00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:13,753
Sunaina? Who?

519
00:55:15,656 --> 00:55:18,523
Oh yes. Sunaina. How's she?

520
00:55:19,493 --> 00:55:21,017
It's been long since we met

521
00:55:22,062 --> 00:55:24,030
As kids, we used to play together

522
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:31,794
I'm hungry

523
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:36,031
Last night I told you to eat,
but you were worried about ghosts

524
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:49,054
Wonderful

525
00:55:51,425 --> 00:55:53,393
Hi! I'm Aditya Sekhri.

526
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:56,391
And you?
- I'm Lucky Negi

527
00:55:58,432 --> 00:56:01,492
strange. Last night too
I met one Lucky Negi

528
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:04,000
But she wasn't like you one bit

529
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:07,003
Do you know her?
- I used to

530
00:56:08,175 --> 00:56:10,006
History, eh?

531
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:14,013
You forgot her so fast.
Would you forget me too?

532
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:21,520
Hello, no need to get ideas.
I was only joking

533
00:56:22,189 --> 00:56:24,020
Let me go and arrange
some food for you

534
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:27,353
I know

535
00:56:30,564 --> 00:56:34,022
What's that for?
- To pluck apples

536
00:56:34,768 --> 00:56:37,532
I'm going with you.
- No. Stay here...

537
00:56:38,538 --> 00:56:40,506
and take care of my Queen Tullu

538
00:56:41,508 --> 00:56:43,772
Who will come here?
- Anyone

539
00:56:44,745 --> 00:56:47,043
Who?
- Anyone

540
00:56:47,414 --> 00:56:49,211
Look that way.
- Why?

541
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:51,379
Turn around!

542
00:56:52,252 --> 00:56:54,550
I feel shy, I need to
take my underwear

543
00:56:56,223 --> 00:56:57,383
c'mon

544
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:00,555
Today's school girls!

545
00:57:03,497 --> 00:57:05,988
Done. And, also clean my car

546
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:09,736
Where will I find you, Adi?

547
00:57:10,237 --> 00:57:12,000
You have a point

548
00:57:12,506 --> 00:57:14,474
I never thought of it.
Hold this

549
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:20,505
If you want to find me,
follow this. Okay?

550
00:57:25,452 --> 00:57:27,352
Loosen your hold

551
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:32,020
Why are you so worried
about your car?

552
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,492
You're always calling me
a school girl

553
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:39,029
And look at you! Always crying
for it like a school boy

554
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,089
It's only a car

555
00:57:41,601 --> 00:57:42,568
shut up!

556
00:57:49,075 --> 00:57:51,043
What's "Queen Tullu" about?

557
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:55,546
I'm a king. The eldest queen
is called Queen Tullu

558
00:57:56,149 --> 00:57:58,549
so, of all my cars,
she's my Queen Tullu

559
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:02,115
I was born in her lap,
in her lap I played...

560
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:05,981
she has showed me around, she's been
hurt several times because of me...

561
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,988
but she never let any harm come to me.
So you see, she's my nanny

562
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:12,654
I belong to a royal family

563
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:16,331
Heard me?

564
00:58:58,245 --> 00:58:59,212
Yes

565
00:59:00,213 --> 00:59:02,443
General Anatoly is here to see you

566
00:59:03,016 --> 00:59:05,484
I asked him to sit outside,
but he said he can't wait

567
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:07,316
send him in

568
00:59:17,697 --> 00:59:21,326
You can't help me.
In fact, I've come to help you

569
00:59:25,171 --> 00:59:28,140
"Hey folks, try to recognize me..."

570
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:32,010
"where I come from, who I am"

571
00:59:32,512 --> 00:59:35,538
"Who am I?"

572
00:59:36,716 --> 00:59:39,344
"Who am I?"

573
00:59:43,523 --> 00:59:44,490
P.D.

574
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:49,395
I bring news about Adi and Lucky

575
00:59:51,731 --> 00:59:52,698
Great

576
00:59:57,237 --> 00:59:59,535
An explosive factory
was blasted yesterday

577
01:00:01,241 --> 01:00:05,541
A cop stopped Adi at a checkpost
near the factory

578
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:13,042
When the terrorists attacked,
Adi slipped away

579
01:00:16,323 --> 01:00:22,228
Ever since, there's no news of him
or his car

580
01:00:23,597 --> 01:00:24,564
But...

581
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,568
No news is always good news

582
01:00:30,637 --> 01:00:32,605
There's another good news

583
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,608
Lucky is with him

584
01:00:36,843 --> 01:00:37,810
Amazing!

585
01:00:39,279 --> 01:00:42,077
Where is she?
- With your son

586
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:43,816
Impossible

587
01:00:44,584 --> 01:00:46,552
With Adi? Why?

588
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,418
I too want to know why

589
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:54,088
But I know that they are together

590
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:59,094
Good she is not alone.
Besides, Adi can speak Russian

591
01:00:59,799 --> 01:01:01,699
I'll inform Negi

592
01:01:05,772 --> 01:01:09,037
Only P. D can trace them, I told you

593
01:01:09,476 --> 01:01:14,038
In my worries for Lucky, I doubted
P. D's capabilities, sir

594
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,046
Another in your place too would've
been surprised by his antics

595
01:01:28,094 --> 01:01:30,062
Where is he?

596
01:01:35,635 --> 01:01:37,330
Got a screwdriver?

597
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:42,069
P. D?

598
01:01:54,688 --> 01:01:56,246
But in such a short time...
- How did I change the mask?

599
01:02:00,627 --> 01:02:03,027
I'll tell you that in leisure

600
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:07,029
I got to go to the telephone exchange.
- What for?

601
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:14,033
If Adi has a cellphone, I'll talk
to him and find out where they are

602
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:17,038
But all the phone lines
are dead, sir

603
01:02:17,544 --> 01:02:21,537
Who said they can't be fixed
for just five minutes?

604
01:02:27,754 --> 01:02:29,722
A great man once said...

605
01:02:31,224 --> 01:02:37,060
"small things like these
happen always in great cities"

606
01:03:48,334 --> 01:03:50,063
Over here

607
01:03:50,403 --> 01:03:53,065
How did you get there?
- Peter helped me

608
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:56,399
Hungry?

609
01:03:59,279 --> 01:04:02,510
If you are a vegetarian, eat this.
Else...

610
01:04:06,553 --> 01:04:09,351
Phone... phone
My phone buzzed!

611
01:04:11,391 --> 01:04:13,018
Hello Aditya Sekhri here

612
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,028
I have only five minutes

613
01:04:16,229 --> 01:04:19,528
so don't ask questions,
just answer me

614
01:04:21,634 --> 01:04:26,037
The Ambassador, your father,
asked me to trace you

615
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:28,607
Are you okay?
- Yes

616
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:30,702
Are you hurt?
- No

617
01:04:31,311 --> 01:04:32,278
Good

618
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:34,376
How's Lucky?
- How did you?

619
01:04:34,581 --> 01:04:36,378
No questions, I said

620
01:04:36,749 --> 01:04:38,717
How's Lucky?
- Fine

621
01:04:40,453 --> 01:04:42,182
Now tell me, where are you folks?

622
01:04:42,355 --> 01:04:44,550
Indulos Kaya graveyard

623
01:04:44,858 --> 01:04:48,055
That's it
I'm coming. Stay put

624
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:50,729
I'll be there within an hour.
- All right

625
01:04:58,438 --> 01:05:00,065
shall we go home?

626
01:05:07,146 --> 01:05:13,016
Actually, we can stare into each
other's eyes and sit here all day...

627
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,521
but there's a small hitch. The fishes
can't get fried on their own

628
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:25,028
so if you don't mind, would you
get some firewood like a good girl?

629
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:28,267
For fire?
- That's right

630
01:05:28,768 --> 01:05:31,032
I've sent Peter to fetch a microwave

631
01:05:31,304 --> 01:05:35,206
But in the meantime, we'll have
to make adjustments

632
01:05:35,775 --> 01:05:38,369
The lighter is in the car, hurry up

633
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:43,538
Take the water-bottle.
It's there, to your right

634
01:05:48,187 --> 01:05:53,056
"He will come..."

635
01:05:54,794 --> 01:05:58,560
"he, who has to come,
will come"

636
01:06:17,717 --> 01:06:21,346
sorry Sunaina, I like Adi

637
01:06:25,258 --> 01:06:28,352
Sunaina, I like your friend

638
01:06:29,262 --> 01:06:31,696
I think, I love him

639
01:06:32,198 --> 01:06:34,166
But she is a little too young

640
01:07:11,537 --> 01:07:13,505
Lucky! Don't drink the water

641
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:18,669
Lucky! Don't drink the water.
It's poisoned!

642
01:07:36,129 --> 01:07:40,031
Lucky! Don't drink the water

643
01:08:53,239 --> 01:08:56,037
I'm sorry, it was my mistake.
The water was laced

644
01:08:57,777 --> 01:08:58,744
No...

645
01:09:00,246 --> 01:09:01,474
No Lucky...

646
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,115
Oh... my God!

647
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:00,528
Please help

648
01:10:21,827 --> 01:10:23,055
Help

649
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:43,081
I had promised Lucky...

650
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:46,084
that I'd take her to the
safety of her house

651
01:10:48,321 --> 01:10:50,084
Not to the Heavens.

652
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:52,624
Help...
- Need help?

653
01:10:55,728 --> 01:10:57,423
Are you Indian?

654
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:01,564
Half

655
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:05,532
You need a doctor?
- Yes

656
01:11:12,078 --> 01:11:14,546
What's happened to her?
- She drank the water here

657
01:11:16,249 --> 01:11:18,217
so have they, too.
- I know

658
01:11:19,085 --> 01:11:20,575
That's why she needs
to be rushed to a doctor

659
01:11:26,559 --> 01:11:28,049
What can you give?

660
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:34,058
Oh, sure

661
01:11:36,535 --> 01:11:38,059
It's too little

662
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,068
My cellphone.
This is all I have

663
01:11:50,216 --> 01:11:52,411
And that necklace?

664
01:11:53,486 --> 01:11:57,081
It isn't mine. If it were mine,
I'd surely have given it to you

665
01:11:58,457 --> 01:11:59,583
Is the car yours?

666
01:12:02,395 --> 01:12:04,363
Yes, it's mine

667
01:12:07,266 --> 01:12:09,234
so make up your mind.
The girl? Or the car?

668
01:12:28,254 --> 01:12:34,056
Queen, please go with him.
I'll bring you back

669
01:12:35,628 --> 01:12:39,564
But if she goes away, I won't
ever be able to bring her back

670
01:12:43,436 --> 01:12:45,404
forgive me, please

671
01:13:56,108 --> 01:13:58,406
How do you know my son?
- Son?

672
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:01,339
Yes, the one who brought you here
is my son

673
01:14:02,047 --> 01:14:04,015
Are you an Indian?
- Yes

674
01:14:04,216 --> 01:14:06,013
I'm Indian, too.
- Thank God for that

675
01:14:32,144 --> 01:14:34,305
You... love her very much?

676
01:14:45,591 --> 01:14:47,058
Give me some water,
will you?

677
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:55,066
I wonder how many innocent lives
this war will claim

678
01:14:55,267 --> 01:14:57,064
That's it

679
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:43,543
Will she be all right?
- She has been given medication

680
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,377
Now pray that...

681
01:16:35,301 --> 01:16:37,360
"Listen..."

682
01:16:37,536 --> 01:16:39,697
"O pretty one, listen to me..."

683
01:17:00,259 --> 01:17:04,491
"silence speaks today..."

684
01:17:06,365 --> 01:17:08,993
"my heartbeat's going awry..."

685
01:17:09,268 --> 01:17:11,998
"there's something
my heart is saying"

686
01:17:13,305 --> 01:17:15,000
"Listen..."

687
01:17:20,713 --> 01:17:24,012
"O pretty one, listen to me..."

688
01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:58,039
"Memories of moments spent together
stand frozen in time"

689
01:17:58,784 --> 01:18:04,484
"I'm reminded of the things
you said to me"

690
01:18:04,757 --> 01:18:09,990
"On my moist eyes,
even tears have frozen..."

691
01:18:11,263 --> 01:18:16,496
"but I still can't
take my eyes off you"

692
01:18:16,802 --> 01:18:22,001
"How helpless I feel,
what am I to do?"

693
01:18:23,175 --> 01:18:26,008
"My heartbeat's going awry..."

694
01:18:26,178 --> 01:18:28,510
"there's something
my heart is saying"

695
01:18:29,114 --> 01:18:30,672
"Listen..."

696
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,177
"O pretty one, listen to me..."

697
01:18:41,493 --> 01:18:46,521
"silence speaks today..."

698
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:50,533
"my heartbeat's going awry..."

699
01:18:50,736 --> 01:18:53,364
"there's something
my heart is saying"

700
01:18:54,073 --> 01:18:55,540
"Listen..."

701
01:18:55,741 --> 01:18:59,040
"O pretty one, listen to me..."

702
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,992
"With a tender kiss,
I'd take away all your sorrows..."

703
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:27,003
"I'd bring for you
every happiness in the world"

704
01:19:27,606 --> 01:19:33,010
"My pining, I'd suppress
in my heart..."

705
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:39,342
"every desire of mine,
I'd sacrifice for you"

706
01:19:39,718 --> 01:19:45,020
"On fearful lips,
is a prayer..."

707
01:19:46,225 --> 01:19:48,193
"my heartbeat's going awry..."

708
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:51,527
"there's something
my heart is saying"

709
01:19:52,064 --> 01:19:53,361
"Listen..."

710
01:19:54,066 --> 01:19:56,364
"O pretty one, listen to me..."

711
01:20:25,631 --> 01:20:27,565
Are we home?

712
01:20:37,643 --> 01:20:42,080
"O Righteousness King Rama..."

713
01:20:42,548 --> 01:20:46,575
"Thou art the Lord of Sita"

714
01:20:47,286 --> 01:20:51,586
"You are Ishwar,
You are Allah..."

715
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:56,091
"let sanity prevail, Lord"

716
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,368
Is someone there?

717
01:21:08,574 --> 01:21:11,543
What happened?
- We were coming towards the embassy...

718
01:21:11,743 --> 01:21:13,040
when someone attacked us

719
01:21:19,751 --> 01:21:23,050
This is ridiculous! Even the Indians
are now being attacked!

720
01:21:28,794 --> 01:21:31,058
Excuse me, Ma'am.
Mr. Negi wants to see you

721
01:21:31,263 --> 01:21:33,231
He's waiting for you in the
Ambassador's office

722
01:21:35,434 --> 01:21:39,063
Dhara... stay right here.
I'll be back soon

723
01:22:22,247 --> 01:22:25,045
Get out! Get going! Go on!
- What are you saying?

724
01:22:25,317 --> 01:22:27,717
The police are searching every house
for the terrorists!

725
01:22:28,253 --> 01:22:31,051
You know how seriously ill Lucky is.
If I take her away, she'll surely die!

726
01:22:31,256 --> 01:22:33,053
But I'll land in trouble if they
find you in my house!

727
01:22:33,191 --> 01:22:35,386
They're scouring every house
for the terrorists!

728
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,551
But they're looking for terrorists!
And we are not terrorists, are we?

729
01:22:38,096 --> 01:22:40,223
I'm the Indian Ambassador's son!
- How will you prove that you are...

730
01:22:40,432 --> 01:22:43,060
the Indian Ambassador's son?
- With just a telephone call

731
01:22:43,335 --> 01:22:46,202
Telephone call? All telephone lines
have been cut off!

732
01:22:51,243 --> 01:22:53,074
Doctor...
- What doctor?

733
01:22:53,245 --> 01:22:56,078
Do you have a passport to
prove your identity?

734
01:22:57,282 --> 01:23:01,514
They're going to drag you away
and dump you in a dark cell!

735
01:23:02,187 --> 01:23:05,520
And the two of you will rot there
until this war is over!

736
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:09,021
And that might take 5 years,
10 years or even twenty!

737
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:14,028
Take this... and get going

738
01:23:14,733 --> 01:23:17,361
All right. I'll go away

739
01:23:19,071 --> 01:23:23,098
But I'll really be grateful to you
if you let Lucky stay here

740
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:28,705
It's terribly cold out there, doctor.
She won't be able to survive

741
01:23:30,182 --> 01:23:33,549
I had promised to take her home
to safety

742
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:38,553
Please... please, doctor?

743
01:23:45,163 --> 01:23:50,726
What do you want me to do?
Beg you? Fall at your feet?

744
01:23:51,436 --> 01:23:55,532
Stand before you with folded hands?
I'm willing to do that, too

745
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:59,402
Please... it's just a matter
of a few days

746
01:24:01,346 --> 01:24:06,010
I don't want any arguments with you
I told you... just go away

747
01:24:07,519 --> 01:24:10,010
sticking a few Indian movie posters
on your walls...

748
01:24:11,056 --> 01:24:12,683
does not make you an Indian!

749
01:24:16,294 --> 01:24:20,025
Doctor, an Indian is one who
will burn his own house...

750
01:24:20,599 --> 01:24:23,033
to protect others.
Thank you

751
01:24:36,648 --> 01:24:38,047
What happened to you?
Are we going to a party?

752
01:24:46,825 --> 01:24:51,057
Now you're crying. You'll go home
and say, I only made you cry

753
01:24:52,097 --> 01:24:54,065
Why're you crying? Huh?

754
01:24:57,102 --> 01:25:00,071
Am I crying?
I'm here with you

755
01:25:24,296 --> 01:25:26,196
forgive me, my child

756
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,134
My daughter is also as old
as you are

757
01:25:33,071 --> 01:25:36,700
If I didn't worry for her safety...

758
01:25:37,075 --> 01:25:41,205
I'd never have let the two of you
leave this place in this manner

759
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:51,716
But what can I do? An Indian has
been let down by a father today

760
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:59,559
But I pray that wherever you live,
you are always safe and sound

761
01:26:24,653 --> 01:26:26,211
Adi...

762
01:28:29,878 --> 01:28:34,611
I've just had a telephone conversation
with the Minister of External Affairs...

763
01:28:35,184 --> 01:28:37,618
in India, and we have reached
the conclusion...

764
01:28:38,187 --> 01:28:41,623
that all of you will be evacuated
to India at the earliest

765
01:28:44,827 --> 01:28:46,624
Because...

766
01:28:48,397 --> 01:28:51,366
because the situation is worsening
beyond control

767
01:28:52,768 --> 01:28:56,636
In the next 12 hours, all the families
that are here in the Indian embassy...

768
01:28:57,005 --> 01:29:02,637
will be taken to the airport under
special security convoys

769
01:29:04,146 --> 01:29:07,138
With great difficulty, we have
arranged for an aircraft...

770
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:10,910
and it's this aircraft that will
take you folks to New Delhi

771
01:29:14,623 --> 01:29:17,091
sir, sir...

772
01:29:18,093 --> 01:29:20,061
how can we leave everything
and go away like this?

773
01:29:20,729 --> 01:29:22,993
It took me 12 years to set up
my business here and...

774
01:29:23,165 --> 01:29:27,101
you want me to leave it in 12 hours?
It'll destroy my efforts of a lifetime!

775
01:29:27,302 --> 01:29:29,600
I'll be ruined, sir!
- Mr. Agarwal...

776
01:29:29,805 --> 01:29:32,933
if you live, you will be able
to work hard again

777
01:29:33,742 --> 01:29:37,337
But if you stay here, you may
not even live, Mr. Agarwal

778
01:29:38,814 --> 01:29:40,611
But are we going to be
re-established here...

779
01:29:40,816 --> 01:29:43,114
once the situation has normalized?

780
01:29:49,324 --> 01:29:52,623
Even if you do return, do you expect
to find things as they were earlier?

781
01:29:55,097 --> 01:29:58,624
It would be better for us
to forget about this nation

782
01:30:06,441 --> 01:30:07,635
God...

783
01:30:09,778 --> 01:30:13,578
ghosts haunt places like this

784
01:30:20,789 --> 01:30:22,586
scared me

785
01:30:33,869 --> 01:30:35,837
Why's everything so huge in here?

786
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:42,744
No worse place to spend the night.
What do you think, Lucky?

787
01:30:46,682 --> 01:30:48,946
Lucky... Lucky!

788
01:30:51,153 --> 01:30:53,781
Oh my God! Hypothermia!
Once she sleeps, I've had it!

789
01:30:54,823 --> 01:30:58,281
Lucky... wake up!
Open your eyes!

790
01:30:59,761 --> 01:31:00,728
Good.

791
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:05,964
Let me go to sleep.
- Do you know, Lucky?

792
01:31:06,134 --> 01:31:09,297
I know, I shouldn't go to sleep

793
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:14,732
If you go to sleep now, I'll never
be able to sleep in my entire life

794
01:31:17,312 --> 01:31:18,574
so wake up

795
01:31:19,114 --> 01:31:25,075
Ever since we've met, you either call
me a school-girl, or keep scolding me

796
01:31:27,856 --> 01:31:32,259
You don't even know how
to talk politely to girls

797
01:31:34,296 --> 01:31:37,265
What makes you think I don't?
I know all that very well

798
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:41,097
How? What do you say?

799
01:31:46,642 --> 01:31:47,609
Hello

800
01:31:50,345 --> 01:31:52,939
Thank you very much
and...

801
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:58,615
My fault, I'm sorry.
- Is that all?

802
01:31:58,887 --> 01:32:00,855
No, there's more

803
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:05,621
Bye... I say bye
- Bye?

804
01:32:05,994 --> 01:32:09,623
Yes. Why?
- Okay, bye

805
01:32:10,599 --> 01:32:13,067
I've got hypothermia,
and I'm going to sleep

806
01:32:14,303 --> 01:32:16,567
Oh... shit

807
01:32:47,364 --> 01:32:50,663
"slowly, silently,
come dwell in my heart"

808
01:32:52,002 --> 01:32:55,165
"slowly, make for me a world
of my dreams"

809
01:33:14,825 --> 01:33:19,125
"Don't tease me...
I give up"

810
01:33:19,329 --> 01:33:23,959
"Every thing you say
is a pack of lies"

811
01:33:34,344 --> 01:33:38,144
"slowly, silently,
come dwell in my heart"

812
01:33:39,015 --> 01:33:42,314
"slowly, make for me a world
of my dreams"

813
01:34:16,453 --> 01:34:22,619
"stop being stubborn...
forge a relationship with me"

814
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,788
"Build with me a relation"

815
01:34:28,365 --> 01:34:34,634
"Let me go...
let go of my arm"

816
01:34:40,176 --> 01:34:43,805
"feel my heart.
It's thumping wildly"

817
01:34:45,015 --> 01:34:47,813
"Is this how every boy is?"

818
01:34:49,686 --> 01:34:52,655
"For my sake, please don't
shake off my hand and go away"

819
01:34:54,357 --> 01:34:57,656
"slowly, make for me
the world of my dreams"

820
01:34:58,862 --> 01:35:02,662
"slowly, silently,
come dwell in my heart"

821
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:07,659
"slowly, make for me the world
of my dreams"

822
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:32,628
"Our time of union
is fleeting by, wasted"

823
01:35:39,002 --> 01:35:44,634
"What will I say?
This is indeed a dilemma"

824
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:54,639
"How I wish I could lose
my heart to another girl"

825
01:35:55,685 --> 01:35:58,654
"Don't ever do that... I'll
swallow poison and die"

826
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:03,159
"I'll be the Prince of her Dreams"

827
01:36:04,928 --> 01:36:08,159
"There will be several girls like you"

828
01:36:18,208 --> 01:36:22,668
"Do not be so wicked,
do not punish me thus..."

829
01:36:22,912 --> 01:36:26,678
"come, take me in your embrace"

830
01:36:28,318 --> 01:36:31,685
"slowly, silently,
come dwell in my heart"

831
01:36:32,889 --> 01:36:36,017
"slowly, make for me a world
of my dreams"

832
01:36:46,403 --> 01:36:54,367
"Never did I imagine that we would
one day tread the same path"

833
01:36:56,746 --> 01:36:59,715
"slowly, silently,
come dwell in my heart"

834
01:37:01,284 --> 01:37:04,720
"slowly, make for me a world
of my dreams"

835
01:37:22,205 --> 01:37:27,165
Adi... I can't go to sleep.
Something's poking me

836
01:37:31,715 --> 01:37:32,682
Madcap.

837
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:17,817
Don't scream!
They'll take offence

838
01:38:18,361 --> 01:38:21,660
Hand's up
Or I'll shoot you.

839
01:38:23,066 --> 01:38:25,660
"Birju's a little boy,
Uncle's a fatso..."

840
01:38:26,035 --> 01:38:28,003
"and the Uncle goes to Delhi"

841
01:38:29,372 --> 01:38:31,670
"from Delhi, he brought
four bowls..."

842
01:38:32,242 --> 01:38:34,176
"one of which was broken"

843
01:38:34,978 --> 01:38:37,173
"And Uncle's legs were broken!"

844
01:38:50,727 --> 01:38:52,695
You sure have grown up, lad

845
01:38:59,936 --> 01:39:01,904
Looks like you haven't had anything
to eat in two days

846
01:39:02,906 --> 01:39:05,033
Hi! I'm PD
How about going home?

847
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:24,986
Why the Russian army uniform?

848
01:39:25,695 --> 01:39:30,655
15 hours from now, the last plane
will take off from the airport here

849
01:39:31,201 --> 01:39:36,161
Orders are to airlift all Indians
living here to Delhi

850
01:39:37,106 --> 01:39:40,007
A friend of mine is an officer
in the Russian army

851
01:39:40,877 --> 01:39:44,677
His battalion will be leaving this
place in just a little while

852
01:39:45,849 --> 01:39:49,012
In this uniform, we will look
a part of his battalion

853
01:39:52,722 --> 01:39:55,691
And this is the safest way
of making it to the airport

854
01:39:57,894 --> 01:39:59,691
And my Papa?

855
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:02,398
Is he leaving me and going away?

856
01:40:07,070 --> 01:40:12,633
He will leave you and go away if you
don't get to the airport on time

857
01:40:13,243 --> 01:40:15,211
And as long as Pindi Das Kapoor
is around...

858
01:40:15,378 --> 01:40:18,643
I just can't see how you won't
make it to the airport

859
01:40:19,349 --> 01:40:21,647
God doesn't work his miracles
every now and then

860
01:40:23,186 --> 01:40:26,155
My child, as the
wise old saying goes...

861
01:40:27,156 --> 01:40:29,716
"He who is protected by the Lord,
no one can ever slay"

862
01:40:30,793 --> 01:40:32,658
Let me see!

863
01:40:33,429 --> 01:40:35,158
You look like a baby Sikh!

864
01:40:38,301 --> 01:40:44,672
So all right. From Lucky,
let me turn her into Lakhan Singh

865
01:40:48,444 --> 01:40:51,345
A true son of Punjab now!
That's something!

866
01:40:54,217 --> 01:40:56,685
Let's go, comrade.
Shall we?

867
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:21,640
Two miles away to the north
is a railway station

868
01:41:22,145 --> 01:41:24,113
That's where we've got to
take a train from

869
01:41:25,214 --> 01:41:27,148
It's tricky territory

870
01:41:28,051 --> 01:41:32,647
There's also the frozen sea ahead.
But if we stick to this battalion...

871
01:41:33,856 --> 01:41:35,824
we won't face any danger

872
01:41:36,693 --> 01:41:40,652
Keep marching on quietly.
I'll go and take a look ahead

873
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:55,175
Hey midget...

874
01:41:56,379 --> 01:41:59,678
however high you wear the helmet,
you're still going to be the midget!

875
01:42:03,853 --> 01:42:05,684
Hungry?

876
01:42:18,801 --> 01:42:20,769
What's this?
- Meat

877
01:42:21,804 --> 01:42:23,635
I can't eat this.
- Why not?

878
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:26,171
It's a sin.
- Why?

879
01:42:26,342 --> 01:42:27,775
I'm a veggie

880
01:42:30,046 --> 01:42:33,311
Eat it up. Else, we'll neither
be veggies, nor alive

881
01:43:35,845 --> 01:43:37,335
Hey! Adi!

882
01:43:58,434 --> 01:44:00,163
Help! Help!

883
01:44:07,944 --> 01:44:09,673
Hands up.
- Put your hands up

884
01:44:26,129 --> 01:44:28,757
Whatever they ask,
just say "Da"

885
01:44:29,832 --> 01:44:31,629
"Da" means yes

886
01:44:57,193 --> 01:44:59,161
Adi, what did he say?

887
01:45:00,029 --> 01:45:02,657
He wants us to prepare ground plans
of the army-base for him

888
01:45:03,699 --> 01:45:06,167
But we know nothing of that.
- Give it to me

889
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:19,104
What sketches are you making?
- This is what I'm going to give him

890
01:45:21,317 --> 01:45:23,285
Maybe this will save us

891
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:21,666
No... no!

892
01:47:27,743 --> 01:47:29,176
Snatch that gun!

893
01:47:31,881 --> 01:47:32,677
Get behind me, Lucky!

894
01:48:44,253 --> 01:48:46,687
Are you okay?
- Adi! Hurry up

895
01:49:48,317 --> 01:49:50,148
I'll go and check on PD!

896
01:50:14,176 --> 01:50:15,643
Make it quick, Adi!

897
01:50:19,381 --> 01:50:21,349
PD's not in the truck, Lucky!
He's not at the wheels!

898
01:50:21,951 --> 01:50:23,646
What happened to him?

899
01:50:25,454 --> 01:50:26,944
See that place?

900
01:50:28,424 --> 01:50:29,391
Jump!

901
01:51:22,244 --> 01:51:28,649
"A strange feeling
torments my heart"

902
01:51:31,387 --> 01:51:35,653
"Maybe this is love"

903
01:51:37,793 --> 01:51:44,665
"In yearning,
my heart finds peace"

904
01:51:47,102 --> 01:51:51,163
"Maybe this is love itself"

905
01:51:53,075 --> 01:51:58,172
"I said nothing,
I heard nothing..."

906
01:51:58,714 --> 01:52:00,341
"and yet..."

907
01:52:02,284 --> 01:52:06,186
"I'm restless at heart"

908
01:52:08,257 --> 01:52:10,623
"my feet falter..."

909
01:52:11,327 --> 01:52:14,125
"we're in trouble..."

910
01:52:17,333 --> 01:52:21,633
"how are we to steady
ourselves, my love?"

911
01:52:23,839 --> 01:52:30,642
"Much against our wishes,
we've gotten close to each other"

912
01:52:33,015 --> 01:52:36,644
"Yes, this perhaps is love"

913
01:53:04,713 --> 01:53:07,011
Lucky! Lucky!

914
01:53:08,217 --> 01:53:10,117
Stop there, Lucky!
Stop there!

915
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:24,622
"Keep an eye,
stand vigil on the heart..."

916
01:53:27,403 --> 01:53:31,635
"but it still won't heed anyone"

917
01:53:34,076 --> 01:53:40,640
"We tread on thorns,
we burn in flames..."

918
01:53:42,685 --> 01:53:45,654
"we're in love,
we shall unite"

919
01:53:48,891 --> 01:53:55,660
"Love blossoms
even in a storm..."

920
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:01,831
"this, perhaps, is love"

921
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:10,610
"A strange feeling
torments my heart"

922
01:54:13,315 --> 01:54:17,615
"Maybe this is love itself"

923
01:56:04,193 --> 01:56:06,821
Lucky... over here!

924
01:57:26,375 --> 01:57:30,004
This door is open!
It's open!

925
01:57:50,232 --> 01:57:51,358
Get in! Quick!

926
01:58:16,825 --> 01:58:19,123
She said there was room
only for one

927
01:58:38,847 --> 01:58:44,683
"Your memories, your eyes..."

928
01:58:48,190 --> 01:58:52,024
"I can't get over
for even a moment"

929
01:58:54,329 --> 01:59:01,701
"so dearly do I love you..."

930
01:59:03,472 --> 01:59:07,704
"how will I ever tell you?"

931
01:59:09,745 --> 01:59:16,150
"The one I love.
Smiles before me..."

932
01:59:18,787 --> 01:59:22,655
"maybe this is love after all"

933
01:59:38,273 --> 01:59:42,676
No, sir. I'm not going anywhere
without my daughter

934
01:59:44,046 --> 01:59:49,678
Negi, my son is with your daughter.
He's gone missing, too

935
01:59:51,219 --> 01:59:53,187
Do you think I'm not
worried at all?

936
01:59:54,823 --> 01:59:57,189
But for how long are we going
to deny the fact that...

937
01:59:57,392 --> 02:00:00,190
it's difficult for them to survive
on those streets out there?

938
02:00:02,197 --> 02:00:05,689
Sir, for me, my daughter
will be alive till such time...

939
02:00:05,901 --> 02:00:08,199
as I find her body

940
02:00:09,838 --> 02:00:13,137
You may go, if you wish to.
But I'm staying here

941
02:00:18,013 --> 02:00:21,642
Negi, you can't stay here. You were
sent here by the Indian government...

942
02:00:21,817 --> 02:00:25,651
which has now decided that all
Indians must go back

943
02:00:25,854 --> 02:00:28,652
To carry out the orders is
our responsibility and duty!

944
02:00:31,259 --> 02:00:33,989
In that case, I tender my
resignation right now, sir

945
02:00:39,801 --> 02:00:41,769
Think about your wife and Dhara

946
02:00:44,372 --> 02:00:46,340
Don't you have any responsibilities
towards them?

947
02:00:48,710 --> 02:00:50,678
If you stay on,
you're going to die

948
02:00:53,048 --> 02:00:55,676
Do you want your wife
to be widowed?

949
02:00:56,852 --> 02:00:58,683
And your little girl Dhara...

950
02:00:58,854 --> 02:01:01,823
loses the support of her father and
her sister, in just a moment?

951
02:01:05,427 --> 02:01:08,692
I give you my word.
Even after we have left...

952
02:01:10,332 --> 02:01:13,130
the search for Lucky
will continue

953
02:01:16,371 --> 02:01:21,638
But, sir, if I don't
have my daughter back...

954
02:01:24,279 --> 02:01:25,246
I...

955
02:02:46,695 --> 02:02:49,163
God, I don't want to pass
my exams

956
02:02:49,965 --> 02:02:53,799
Wherever Lucky is, see that
she has all her luck with her

957
02:03:32,173 --> 02:03:33,140
Adi...

958
02:03:49,357 --> 02:03:52,656
Adi! Adi!

959
02:04:02,237 --> 02:04:03,670
Why've you come back?

960
02:04:07,208 --> 02:04:09,176
Why did you come back?

961
02:04:25,126 --> 02:04:26,616
Why have you come back?

962
02:04:30,198 --> 02:04:33,395
Don't ever say again that you won't
take my hand for a lifetime

963
02:04:36,204 --> 02:04:37,831
What have you done?

964
02:04:53,355 --> 02:04:55,789
I love you... love you

965
02:04:57,859 --> 02:05:00,987
I know... I always knew

966
02:05:42,871 --> 02:05:44,168
Hey PD!

967
02:05:45,006 --> 02:05:48,635
I knew you'd find us! But where
did you find Queen Tullu?

968
02:05:49,911 --> 02:05:53,142
Oh, I love you!
- My boy...

969
02:05:53,681 --> 02:05:56,650
enjoy the fruit,
don't worry about how it has come

970
02:06:00,855 --> 02:06:02,652
By the way...
- What?

971
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:06,927
Come on

972
02:06:39,227 --> 02:06:41,695
Mummy! Papa!
Lucky has arrived!

973
02:07:27,709 --> 02:07:29,336
Let's go

974
02:07:30,245 --> 02:07:32,213
Destiny is that I am to be with you
till this place

975
02:07:33,181 --> 02:07:35,149
As the wise old saying goes...

976
02:07:35,917 --> 02:07:39,683
"seeing loved ones off isn't easy.
So don't ever say good-bye"

977
02:07:41,189 --> 02:07:45,148
"Torn away from me, you will be.
But you will always live in my heart"

978
02:07:48,062 --> 02:07:51,156
Which wise old man said that?
- I did

979
02:07:59,274 --> 02:08:01,242
You take my princess
on the plane...

980
02:08:02,010 --> 02:08:04,706
I'll send your princess
on a ship

981
02:08:04,879 --> 02:08:06,847
Promise?
- Promise

982
02:08:12,687 --> 02:08:14,314
Thanks, PD

983
02:08:16,224 --> 02:08:17,657
Let's go

984
02:08:27,435 --> 02:08:30,666
shall we go home?
- Sure

985
02:08:32,106 --> 02:08:34,802
But not mine. Yours
