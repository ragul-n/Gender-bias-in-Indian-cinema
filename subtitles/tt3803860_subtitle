1
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:08,411
'At that time, from the Aghori
islands...'

2
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:13,551
'...migrated a Demon clan called
'Vethal' invading this land'

3
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:17,652
'They occupied this entire region and
started ruling the land'

4
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:22,989
'This Demon clan is multiple times more
powerful than the human race'

5
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,607
'Their eyes are a vivid blue'

6
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
'When they get angry...'

7
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:30,081
'...their fangs emerge'

8
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:34,134
'The land they ruled came to be known as
'Vethala Desam'...!'

9
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,349
'Amongst them one section travelled
northwards...'

10
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:40,395
'...captured that region and settled
over there'

11
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,550
'That land is called Kangini Desam'

12
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:46,674
'One of the 56 villages under Vethala
regime'

13
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:50,091
'...is Vairanallur'

14
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:53,536
'Though this land looks lush and
green...'

15
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,249
'...ruled by the ruthless Vethala race'

16
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,129
'...people here had no peace of mind'

17
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,519
'They were submerged in sorrow'

18
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:04,024
'To relieve them from the clutches of
the Vethala race'

19
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:06,399
'...and to give them back the joy they
had forsaken'

20
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,509
'...is Vembunathan's dearest dream'

21
00:02:08,534 --> 00:02:09,554
'At that time...'

22
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:23,096
'...out of the blue a baby along with an
egg floated down the river'

23
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:26,614
'Vembunathan took this baby under his
wings'

24
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:36,894
This baby is suffering from an unusual
congenital problem

25
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:41,414
Feed the baby a leaf from this herbal
plant daily

26
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:44,621
If you skip even a single day...

27
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:46,276
...it might be fatal

28
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:47,509
Be careful

29
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:53,499
I feel thirsty

30
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:55,026
Please give me water

31
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:57,687
Haiii! A talking bird?

32
00:02:58,742 --> 00:03:01,262
I'm father of 3 children from today
onwards

33
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,417
'He named the baby Marudheera'

34
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,310
'And the talking bird as Soora'

35
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:08,858
'He raised them both himself'

36
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,723
Forgive me, medicine man

37
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,532
Entire village is scared of demons

38
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,960
Has no one opposed the demons bravely
till now?

39
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:54,044
You are a big boy now

40
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:56,232
You were scared all these days

41
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,982
Aware of your surroundings...

42
00:03:58,118 --> 00:03:59,738
...you're asking questions?

43
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:00,814
I'll tell you

44
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,289
'No outsider can enter this Vethala
Desam's fort'

45
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,510
'Only if they themselves take you in,
you can enter'

46
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:16,422
'Led by Vembunathan the leaders of the
56 villages...'

47
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:20,814
'...entered the fort with prior
permission to meet queen Yavana'

48
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:25,932
Salutations Your Majesty

49
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:31,109
Your soldiers often hit us and grab the
little money and grains we have

50
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:32,791
We are sure...

51
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:35,440
...this wouldn't have come to your
notice

52
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,450
Instigating from behind and torturing
our people...

53
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,769
...is your General Jaladharanga

54
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,920
Isn't it your duty to look after the
welfare of us poor people?

55
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:49,134
-Voice your opinion
-Yes...of course

56
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,280
I am Jaladharanga!

57
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,681
I execute only our queen's orders

58
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,357
'Reason why Vembunathan alone was
allowed to survive is...'

59
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,407
'...seeing him with one hand only'

60
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:47,406
'...no one else will dare oppose the
demons'

61
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:57,535
'Once when the people of Vairanallur
delayed paying their taxes...'

62
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,565
'...Vethala soldiers entered the village
all of a sudden'

63
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:01,732
Forgive us for the delay

64
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:02,642
Here is our tax

65
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:04,558
We won't delay hereafter

66
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,069
My daughter

67
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,059
Please let go of my daughter Pavalamalli

68
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:17,764
I was the one who threw the stone

69
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:22,582
I was scared you might harm Pavalamalli

70
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,381
So I hurled the stone at you

71
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,585
My daughter...oh god!

72
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:56,094
'The demons murdered Marudheera's sister
ruthlessly'

73
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,169
'She sacrificed her life and saved her
brother'

74
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:24,440
'Village head Chinna Varma sent his
daughter Pavalamalli...'

75
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,050
'...to study in her uncle's place in the
neighboring village'

76
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:51,694
'The Tiger'

77
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,220
'Few years later'

78
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:18,835
Load those fruits too

79
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,524
Let's go It's getting late

80
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,814
Chief, demons have entered our village

81
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:24,434
Call Marudheera

82
00:08:24,784 --> 00:08:27,304
He's the only one who can oppose the
demons

83
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:39,301
Leave me

84
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:40,504
Let go of me

85
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:41,883
Sir...sir

86
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:44,012
Please forgive us

87
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:47,966
We are worlds apart

88
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:51,619
You are a Vethal

89
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:53,992
We are a bottomless hole!

90
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,040
You'll be large-hearted enough to
forgive us this one time I hope

91
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,849
Next time we'll queue up

92
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,261
And pay our taxes promptly

93
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:05,876
Marudheera, our tax that's due

94
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
Marudheera is the only reason...

95
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:18,061
...you escape every time holding on to
my legs forcefully

96
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,670
If you delay payment the next time...

97
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:24,511
...you'll all be entombed!

98
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:29,729
Bro, what's your name?

99
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:30,592
Pidari

100
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:32,524
'This is our brother Pidari'

101
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,190
'He hacks with his hatchet happily'

102
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,920
Our brother-

103
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,096
Sing your praises

104
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:38,524
Long live...long live...!

105
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:41,482
'Pidari is our brother clever He chops
people with his cleaver'

106
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,565
Long live! Long live!!

107
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:45,357
'This is our brother Pidari He slashes
with his sickle sturdily'

108
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:45,967
Long live

109
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,649
'This is our brother Pidari He kills
with his club constantly'

110
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:50,941
Pidari is our brother cleve-

111
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:52,871
He pardoned us and left long ago

112
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:54,036
Oh! Has he gone?

113
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,040
Marudheera...!

114
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:02,422
Looks like the entire village is
awestruck by your act

115
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,579
To crouch now is to pounce later

116
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,312
You held his leg today

117
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,732
Tomorrow you'll hold him by the scruff
of his neck

118
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:13,002
That is time's decree

119
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:14,272
Remember that

120
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:15,882
Your blessings, sir

121
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:17,822
Need a small favor

122
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,010
Whoever visits our town...

123
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:22,254
...you bring them home safe and sound

124
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,885
Tomorrow is 'Uthira pooja'

125
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,732
My daughter Pavalamalli is finishing her
studies on this auspicious day

126
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:29,302
And she's coming back home

127
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,754
Tomorrow can you go in the morning...

128
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:36,032
...to the riverbank and bring her?

129
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:41,522
This is also-

130
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,230
This is also-

131
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,857
He's trying to say this is also his duty

132
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:47,707
Isn't that so?

133
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:02,315
Marudheera, will Pavalamalli be dusky,
dark or fair?

134
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:04,005
She'll be green complexioned

135
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:11,802
How do I find Pavalamalli?

136
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:17,857
'Can't find my Tharagamangala'

137
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,691
'Neither on land nor in the water'

138
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:21,607
'She will jump down from the sky maybe'

139
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:22,277
My dearest?

140
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,661
'She has landed'

141
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:26,878
'Who is this work of art layered with
make up?'

142
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:28,876
I'm your cousin Tharagamangala

143
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:32,237
You're not an ordinary star

144
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:33,691
You're a pure white lotus

145
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:35,681
-My mother told me
-What did she say?

146
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:37,561
That you sport a dual moustache

147
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:43,014
Who else in this whole world will be so
daringly different?

148
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,194
From the moment I set eyes on you...

149
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:49,794
...I have fallen flat

150
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,143
He has become as bald as a coot

151
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,800
Hey! Scoot

152
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:54,397
Angamuthu...?

153
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:55,607
I'll be right back

154
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:56,877
How is your business?

155
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:28,771
Marudheera, I'm so happy...

156
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,141
...you're riding us home

157
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:33,555
He is 'guiding' us sounds better!

158
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:38,892
Marudheera, you've grown beyond
recognition, moustache and all now

159
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,279
You don't sport a moustache

160
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:46,915
But does that mean you haven't changed?

161
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:49,495
You look like 'poetry in motion'

162
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,447
I must say, you look like a chiselled
work of art

163
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:58,588
Your sari drapes that layer

164
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,399
You're turning me into a slayer

165
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:01,429
Alright Forget it

166
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,594
So what else is happening?

167
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:05,859
Very eventful indeed

168
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,315
Even yesterday Marudheera fell at the
demon's feet

169
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,108
Pleaded and saved our village from a
fate worse than death

170
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,190
You fell at his feet to save our
village?

171
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,100
'Blabbermouth!'

172
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:17,161
I'm ashamed to say I belong to
Vairanallur

173
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:18,235
Kodangi...?

174
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:21,732
All this cannot be understood

175
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:23,342
Why not?

176
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,140
Doesn't our village boast of daredevil
men at all?

177
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:34,101
Marudheera, turn the carriage to the
left

178
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:35,804
We can all escape

179
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,482
If you aim for the man in the middle and
fall at his feet, we can escape

180
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:40,152
Don't think

181
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:42,381
Let us escape and then think

182
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:36,202
Pat on the back!

183
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:41,883
Bravo!

184
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:42,967
Well done!

185
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,565
In the 'Goat and tiger' game...

186
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:46,482
...you have proved you are the tiger

187
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,812
You are beyond compare

188
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:49,732
You are unbeatable

189
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:52,322
Then why did you fall at his feet
yesterday?

190
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:56,482
For Pavalamalli's sake I'll fight the
mightiest army

191
00:18:56,492 --> 00:18:57,872
And powder them to dust

192
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:01,549
But if innocent people are dependent on
me...

193
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:04,352
...I have to yield a little bit

194
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:07,816
Patience is another quality along with
bravery

195
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:11,246
If that patience is mistaken for
cowardice, what can I do?

196
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,410
Other than that-

197
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:17,102
No one needs to be ashamed for being a
Vairanallur maiden

198
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,607
Courageous men live in Vairanallur too!

199
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,697
Fly like the wind!

200
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:25,982
Tharagai, I can't wait any longer

201
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:28,932
Let us plan our wedding and finish it
phat-a-phut!

202
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:31,384
Mother

203
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:33,024
Come, dear How are you?

204
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:33,994
I'm good, mother

205
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,066
Pavalamalli, bless you, my child

206
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:38,482
Mother, on our way back we were in great
danger

207
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:39,632
Marudheera saved us

208
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,710
Thank you, Marudheera

209
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:43,809
That is my duty

210
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:46,634
Come

211
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:03,718
What?

212
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,040
What happened?

213
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:09,057
I just cannot believe it

214
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:10,259
Why?

215
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,375
The demons you had arranged...

216
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,417
...surpassed the real Vethals!

217
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:15,301
Fantastic!

218
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:17,159
What an act What agility!

219
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:19,002
What grace and poise!

220
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:20,676
Marudheera

221
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,222
Seeing you fight nimble-footed...

222
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:26,054
...won't Pavalamalli fall in love with
you?

223
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:28,387
I should think so

224
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:31,982
She had better, otherwise I'll arrange
for another duel

225
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:32,718
What next?

226
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:34,551
What?

227
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,621
'Uthira pooja' the sacred ritual

228
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,711
"Our clan, our kinsmen Come out, men and
women"

229
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:17,964
"If our people get together enemies will
flee forever"

230
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:23,556

00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:39,691
"Hand and glove, weapon and wisdom"

235
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,921
"My dear brothers, trust me and come"

236
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:45,623
"Atrocities to weed Slaves to be freed"

237
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,066
"In the early morning rays, with
blood-red eyes, stalks its preys"

238
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:52,076
"Tiger, bagha, bhiru, huli chui milia,

239
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:58,212

tiger prowls, noses around"

240
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,349
"Tiger, bagh, kai, puli vyala, sih,
karvara, huli"

241
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:09,131
"Without fear, it supersedes The brave
tiger succeeds"

242
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:31,878
"Hey! Look who is here King of the
jungle dear"

243
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:38,264
"Dear me! In this maiden's soul he
churns love heart-whole"

244
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:45,812
"Can a seed ever grow if the soil
doesn't know?"

245
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:49,066
"Can a thread be woven without a loom in
action?"

246
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,296
"Our beloved prince Our quintessence"

247
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:57,161
"Will deceit conquer our motherland
ever?"

248
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,607
"Can a rat wag its tail even in a
tiger's tall grassy den?"

249
00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:04,337
"Toil by trusting in yourself A village
won't change by itself"

250
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,527
"Let change begin with you, brother"

251
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:11,941
"When we wake up however our dream
should come true forever"

252
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:15,431
"Cheetto, vag, harimau, tier tigre,

253
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:20,210

women"

254
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:26,006

00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:35,421

265
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:40,875
"Tigru, tiger, tygr, teigr tigri,
tigear, tygrys, tiger"

266
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:08,196
Come, Marudheera

267
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:10,988
Greetings, chief

268
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:12,331
How are you?

269
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:14,224
I'm good, son

270
00:25:16,486 --> 00:25:17,746
Whatever it may be...

271
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,476
...there's a nip in the air when the
cold season starts

272
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,086
Of course

273
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:25,071
That's why I thought the nip in the
air...

274
00:25:26,486 --> 00:25:27,506
...can be enjoyed

275
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:29,238
'Enjoyed' means?

276
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,629
I just thought I could take your
daughter for a ride

277
00:25:34,653 --> 00:25:35,976
Are you playing the fool?

278
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:36,586
Why?

279
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:40,026
Isn't this the right time to play?

280
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:43,184
When you were kids you might have played
together

281
00:25:43,194 --> 00:25:43,794
Even now?

282
00:25:47,653 --> 00:25:49,873
Malli...coming? We can go for a walk?

283
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:53,628
Get inside

284
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:57,631
You can leave now

285
00:25:58,486 --> 00:25:59,746
Don't waste your time

286
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:01,184
Without my permission...

287
00:26:01,194 --> 00:26:03,534
...my daughter won't cross our doorstep

288
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:07,871
Look over there, dear

289
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,201
How could you?

290
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:14,059
Is this how much you respect your
father?

291
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:15,684
When have I ever disobeyed him, ma?

292
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:18,059
That's why I used the rear entrance
instead!

293
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:18,729
See you, ma

294
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:20,086
Pavala...?

295
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:32,586
How did you recognize me yesterday?

296
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:34,961
Your eyes

297
00:26:37,986 --> 00:26:40,386
When my sister died when we were
young...

298
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,401
...the same eyes shed tears for me

299
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:47,169
You are...

300
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:49,086
...a poem

301
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:50,938
That means?

302
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:53,203
You know how poetry should be?

303
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,086
How?

304
00:26:57,986 --> 00:27:00,476
Like the 'mundu' worn by the women of
Kerala

305
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,286
Fully draped and not revealing

306
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:05,643
Like the attire of the women of
Maharashtra

307
00:27:05,653 --> 00:27:07,273
Covering and not concealing

308
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:10,266
Like the sari-clad women of Tamil Nadu

309
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:12,976
Revealing and yet concealing

310
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:14,426
Covered and still opened

311
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:16,166
This is the metre for poetry

312
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:17,681
In that way you are...

313
00:27:20,236 --> 00:27:21,496
...'poetry in motion'

314
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:24,809
I think with your poem you'll make a
girl surrender

315
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:26,379
We indulge in so many acts

316
00:27:26,694 --> 00:27:28,074
Won't we excel in this?

317
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:34,179
My father is intent on getting me
married to my betrothed

318
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,851
Even when you went to the neighboring
land to study...

319
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:39,768
...I took good care of you in my heart

320
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:41,278
Will I let go of you now?

321
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,893
I want to share this happy news with you

322
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,059
I can't believe my luck

323
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:01,589
Tharagai and I are getting married
tomorrow

324
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,519
Why all of a sudden?

325
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:11,146
You got the glow of a new groom now!

326
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:14,268
If you had waited a little longer you
could've got married...

327
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:16,518
...when you're 60 as a milestone ritual

328
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:17,368
Don't make fun

329
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:18,373
There's more

330
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:22,059
You should be in the forefront and
perform my wedding

331
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:22,849
We'll rock it

332
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,476
Then for my wedding night-

333
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:26,684
That's too indecent if you made out in
front of me

334
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:27,559
Don't be impulsive

335
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:29,369
You are full of youthful vigor

336
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,089
You'll know how to satiate your future
wife

337
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:34,559
Your fertile imagination will be working
overtime

338
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:36,309
If you give me just 3 tips...

339
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,476
...I'll follow it to a T

340
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,466
And mesmerize Tharagai completely

341
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:43,476
You won't tell me?

342
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:45,706
Then shall I ask you a general doubt?

343
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:47,878
Shoot

344
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,759
For the wedding night...

345
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:54,886
...milk and fruits are essential, right?

346
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,579
Why are you laughing?

347
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,351
Milk and fruits are necessary

348
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:15,388
First of all you should have enough
strength in your body

349
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:33,404
Bless the couple

350
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:36,368
I have wedded my beloved Tharagamangala

351
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:49,816
My dear sweetheart

352
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,599
For so long I was waiting for this day

353
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:55,946
Tharagai...give-

354
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,194
'What is he looking for?'

355
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:05,476
Is your father a flower vendor?

356
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:06,806
What a silly question!

357
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:11,489
He has decorated our cot with all the
flowers in the world

358
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:14,906
This doesn't feel like a bedroom

359
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,879
More like a flower market!

360
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:19,581
Is this research very important, now?

361
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:20,878
Akka?

362
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:23,036
How is the nuptial decoration?

363
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,684
You have an overload of conceit

364
00:31:26,694 --> 00:31:29,268
How often I've told you not to call her
'akka'?

365
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,226
You call her sister once more I'll
pickle you to pieces

366
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:32,836
Come out

367
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,858
Till my 3rd baby is born don't cross my
path

368
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:38,226
After the 4th baby?

369
00:31:38,236 --> 00:31:39,476
Don't act smart with me

370
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:40,926
How can you be so rigid?

371
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:41,909
What happened?

372
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:43,206
He barged in

373
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,518
An innocent kid has entered my bedroom

374
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:47,726
What if he gets scared?

375
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:49,476
Who will be answerable to his parents?

376
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:50,266
See you, akka

377
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:51,986
Don't 'see us' Just scoot

378
00:31:52,236 --> 00:31:54,336
You take your wife and go that side

379
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:56,223
I'll take my wife and-

380
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:00,086
Aiyaiyo!

381
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:02,028
After all it's only a cat

382
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:04,476
You're yelling as if it's an elephant

383
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:07,486
This is a terrible omen on such an
auspicious night

384
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:09,893
This shouldn't be ignored

385
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:11,163
Tharaga, come with me

386
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:13,468
Hope nothing bad happens

387
00:32:13,528 --> 00:32:17,188
All because of a cat, they won't make me
strum the love-guitar

388
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:18,623
God help me!

389
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:24,101
The time when the cat crossed...

390
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,518
...Venus occupied the 4th house

391
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,643
And Mars which should have been in the
4th house is in the 7th house

392
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:30,226
Whichever way you see it...

393
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:32,684
...for another 3 days you cannot
initiate your wedding vows

394
00:32:32,694 --> 00:32:33,893
Did I hear this right?

395
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:35,476
Good Lord! Father...mother, help

396
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,518
Astrologer sir, is there any loophole?

397
00:32:37,528 --> 00:32:39,018
My son is in a tearing hurry

398
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:40,601
How else do you expect me to be?

399
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:42,809
You're behaving like a cat on a hot tin
roof here!

400
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:44,559
Then I dread to think what you will do-

401
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:46,129
I will make a deep impact!

402
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:48,476
Every mishap has a redemption

403
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:51,768
Tell me how I should atone I'll do it in
the blink of an eye

404
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:52,738
And start my job

405
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,149
Redemption, right?

406
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:56,063
None indeed

407
00:32:57,528 --> 00:33:00,226
Son-in-law, let us postpone your wedding
night for 3 days

408
00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:03,176
No one will walk away with the water
from the well

409
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:06,494
Can I just fill 1 pail of well water for
the time being?

410
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,769
You are in for trouble even if you fill
a cup!

411
00:33:10,236 --> 00:33:11,016
Get lost, man

412
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,151
Why is your hand full of blisters?

413
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:34,878
Nothing

414
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:35,794
War

415
00:33:36,236 --> 00:33:37,559
I am getting ready for war

416
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:39,009
To drive away the demons

417
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:39,979
Not just me

418
00:33:40,528 --> 00:33:42,448
I am preparing my 3 children too

419
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:48,086
What?

420
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,409
What happened?

421
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,038
Do you have children?

422
00:33:55,444 --> 00:33:56,044
Not as yet

423
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:58,599
But if you...

424
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,879
...co-operate it can happ-

425
00:34:02,486 --> 00:34:03,086
What?

426
00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:11,343
Our next baby won't be a figment of my
imagination

427
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:14,998
What a novel way to profess your love

428
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:19,306
Do I take this smile as a sign of
acceptance or-

429
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:23,253
What?

430
00:34:24,486 --> 00:34:26,526
Are you worried I'll let you down?

431
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:30,748
I'll agree even if I am losing myself

432
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,201
If you are the one who will let me down

433
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:57,526
"Rainbow becomes a circled entity"

434
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:02,549
"Cerulean sky in close proximity"

435
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:09,188
"On earth, cottony clouds gather to robe
this peacock-feather"

436
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:18,173
"Night turns to noon And sun into the
moon"

437
00:35:20,694 --> 00:35:22,314
"Seasons disguise to swoon"

438
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:27,751
"Girl, my beloved lady why do you change
me?"

439
00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:33,536
"With your eyes, lovely lassie why do
you mesmerize me?"

440
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:38,314
"Why do you, girl so fair make my heart
beat faster?"

441
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:43,726
"Why do you, lovable maiden push me into
love's ocean?"

442
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:21,684
"Golden girl of 24 carat purity Come
hither and hug me"

443
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:27,109
"Shower a million stars on me Then I
will hug you willingly"

444
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:30,129
"Hey! Pretty deer so dear"

445
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:34,811
"Lie on my lap here"

446
00:36:39,111 --> 00:36:42,651
"Spotted deer in the tiger's lair
Besotted, fair and square"

447
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:45,648
"How can she flee unaware?"

448
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:51,204
"My adorable alter ego why do you alter
me so?"

449
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:56,246
"With your eyes, lassie why do you
bewitch me?"

450
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:01,329
"Why do you, girl-child make my heart go
wild?"

451
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:07,253
"Why do you, angel from above push me
into this sea of love?"

452
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:43,363
"Your words like a baby chattering flow
as raga Thodi so endearing"

453
00:37:44,486 --> 00:37:48,086
"You kiss me and when I exhale scent of
roses within me sail"

454
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,388
"Nectar and gold merge to flow"

455
00:37:54,569 --> 00:37:56,609
"Your petite feet like lotus glow"

456
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:04,126
"Your claim on my lips you staked
Hoisting a flag my fever you slaked"

457
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:08,051
"After this wonderful wooing where are
you going?"

458
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:11,863
"My enchanting lady why do you change
me?"

459
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:17,703
"With your eyes, enticing lassie why do
you enslave me?"

460
00:38:19,486 --> 00:38:22,666
"Why do you, my soul mate raise my pulse
to escalate?"

461
00:38:24,486 --> 00:38:27,666
"Why do you, my Pavalamalli shove me
into love's sea?"

462
00:38:28,736 --> 00:38:31,496
'With the moon and stars as witness
forever...'

463
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:34,233
'...bowing in reverence to our sacred
river'

464
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:36,554
'...that symbolizes our mother'

465
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:37,913
'...I unite you both'

466
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:45,926
Marudheera What is this?

467
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:50,726
Out of the blue you stand before me as
husband and wife

468
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:52,601
I am very happy for you

469
00:38:52,611 --> 00:38:56,931
Let us announce this evening and get
Malli's father's permission formally

470
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,169
-What, my dear?
-Your blessings, sir

471
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:03,674
Marudheera, by anointing our family
deity with 9 flowers...

472
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:05,726
...we must fulfil our long overdue vow

473
00:39:05,736 --> 00:39:06,636
Definitely, sir

474
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:08,253
Then...

475
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:11,426
...tell us what you want

476
00:39:12,694 --> 00:39:15,754
You were the 1st person who wanted us to
be together

477
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:17,868
Get me a shawl

478
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:22,009
With fond memories of you I will wrap it
around me

479
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,090
'Over-enthusiastic'

480
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:37,093
'They've come in disguise'

481
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:38,216
Demons

482
00:39:39,283 --> 00:39:40,363
Don't worry, Malli

483
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:43,673
These boys will come to show off now and
then

484
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:46,766
A few pats and they will be on their way

485
00:39:49,408 --> 00:39:50,315
You carry on, dear

486
00:39:50,325 --> 00:39:52,231
I'll have my fun and catch up with you

487
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,761
It's been a long time My limbs are
tingling

488
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,410
Why this frenzy?

489
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:10,706
You know she has fallen in love with me

490
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:14,963
Then why disguise yourselves and torture
me like this?

491
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:16,483
Did anyone call you?

492
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,883
Go now, I'll see you in the evening

493
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:22,388
I'll make sure you get your wages

494
00:40:25,283 --> 00:40:28,343
Looks like they won't let me complete
the sacred vow

495
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:36,401
Is someone else dressing up like us?

496
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:51,253
Oh! It's you

497
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,356
On my way I saw 4 or 5 demons

498
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:54,508
So what?

499
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,293
They are real Vethals

500
00:40:57,616 --> 00:41:00,481
Sir already warned everyone not to dress
up like demons

501
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,991
They are original demons?

502
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:04,663
Marudheera...Marudheera

503
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:07,565
The demons are destroying our entire
village

504
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:08,175
Come quick

505
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:25,176
Marudheera, those fiends have set our
village ablaze

506
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:31,543
Can someone save her?

507
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,050
Sir...sir!

508
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:48,303
They showed no concern even for the
elderly

509
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:58,383
Talk to me

510
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:09,123
Marudheera...?

511
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:14,746
The demons have taken Pavalamalli to
their palace

512
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:21,071
They went this way

513
00:42:49,991 --> 00:42:50,591
Marudheera

514
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:51,675
Sir...sir-

515
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,570
Marudheera, I tried my best

516
00:43:03,866 --> 00:43:06,146
But I couldn't save my daughter-in-law

517
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,890
Don't spare those demons

518
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,610
Drink water

519
00:43:23,783 --> 00:43:25,163
Marudheera...Marudheera

520
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:30,055
I want to share a secret with you

521
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:32,686
Drink this water first

522
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:35,165
You...you are-

523
00:43:54,241 --> 00:43:56,461
I was an orphaned baby You rescued me

524
00:43:57,991 --> 00:43:59,851
And raised me as your own child

525
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:07,771
As a son, I haven't done anything for-

526
00:44:17,283 --> 00:44:20,043
I couldn't even wrap you in the shawl
you asked

527
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:52,893
Before 'aiyah' died, he wanted to share
something with me

528
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:58,588
Does anyone know what it is?

529
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:01,853
Don't know, Marudheera

530
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,815
You must take his place and look after
our welfare

531
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:07,690
There is a rumor about sacrifice and
full moon night

532
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,400
Pavalamalli was also born on a full moon
night

533
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,815
You must only save our land that's
enslaved

534
00:45:13,825 --> 00:45:16,825
And rescue my daughter from those
barbaric monsters

535
00:45:19,908 --> 00:45:22,231
We can win them over only through
trickery

536
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:25,241
Your father was very skilled in the art
of disguise

537
00:45:26,283 --> 00:45:29,943
In the same way you should also disguise
yourself like a demon

538
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,690
Then enter the Vethal palace and bring
my daughter back

539
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,360
I have the necessary self confidence

540
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:39,686
But how can I handle them with mere
human power?

541
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,141
I can remedy it

542
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:55,213
This is no ordinary medicine

543
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:58,273
Where footprints of humans have not made
any mark...

544
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:00,856
...this is a juice extracted from rare
cave plants

545
00:46:00,866 --> 00:46:02,066
If you drink this...

546
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:04,940
...blood circulation will speed up
multiple times

547
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,490
The body gets firm and strong to combat
the force of gravity

548
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:11,203
Due to this brain stimulation...

549
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:13,815
...you can receive powers on par with
the demons

550
00:46:13,825 --> 00:46:15,985
We can also fly in mid-air like them

551
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:17,908
And fight with aggression

552
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:19,885
But there's a small hiccup

553
00:46:21,575 --> 00:46:24,095
If consumed at this stage of my
research...

554
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:26,481
...you can stay a demon only for 8
minutes

555
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:29,071
After that you will get back your human
form

556
00:46:32,075 --> 00:46:32,975
Try drinking it

557
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:16,765
Stop...don't go near him

558
00:47:17,325 --> 00:47:17,925
Move away

559
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:19,550
Get back

560
00:47:22,116 --> 00:47:23,676
You are not Marudheera now

561
00:47:23,825 --> 00:47:25,565
Think you are a demon and try

562
00:47:27,283 --> 00:47:29,443
You can do it You can fly in mid-air

563
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:31,550
Get up

564
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:08,366
He flew without any wings

565
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:30,821
If you ask what is impossible in this
world?

566
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,463
It is...not making an effort

567
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:38,383
You have found this strong medicine

568
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,230
And proved it

569
00:48:41,283 --> 00:48:44,283
Marudheera, it is not that easy to enter
their fort

570
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,851
Before that you must find a
super-centenarian Machakoodan

571
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,106
Only he knows all the secrets about the
Vethala palace

572
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:54,796
It seems he is 180 years old

573
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:55,675
180?

574
00:48:57,408 --> 00:48:58,488
One important news

575
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:01,815
Kangini Desam in the north is another
kingdom of demons

576
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:05,845
Once in 5 years medical supplies are
brought from there to this fort

577
00:49:06,575 --> 00:49:08,565
They suffer from rapid decrease of blood
cells

578
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:10,075
That is the cure it seems

579
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,290
Don't know why

580
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:15,411
But I believe the last supplies were
delivered 8 years ago

581
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,565
So you can pretend to be the demon from
Kangini Desam delivering supplies

582
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:20,981
And enter their fort easily

583
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,511
You can take anyone with you for
assistance

584
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:29,555
Let Kodangi and Sama come with me

585
00:49:31,283 --> 00:49:32,003
By all means

586
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:34,323
By promising to free the people...

587
00:49:35,158 --> 00:49:38,278
...he is shutting the door to my wedding
night plans!

588
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:40,856
All of you eat and go to bed early

589
00:49:40,866 --> 00:49:42,231
Must wake up early tomorrow

590
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,773
My marriage won't be consummated

591
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:46,123
How does it matter if I wake up or not?

592
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,871
What is it, Marudheera?

593
00:51:03,283 --> 00:51:04,543
My horse isn't moving

594
00:51:05,408 --> 00:51:06,848
It's scared of something

595
00:51:07,783 --> 00:51:08,743
What did it see?

596
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:15,123
What happened?

597
00:51:15,783 --> 00:51:17,643
Remember what our chief told us

598
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,915
We've entered Yazhi mountain region
where invisible humans reside

599
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:23,511
Invisible humans?

600
00:51:34,575 --> 00:51:36,855
Don't know which direction they are in

601
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,356
Let's greet them in every direction
possible

602
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:39,966
Greetings

603
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,960
-I have a doubt
-What?

604
00:51:49,283 --> 00:51:51,983
Will these invisible people be clothed
or not?

605
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:57,606
They might think they are anyway
invisible and not wear anything at all

606
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:58,816
Then even the girls-

607
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:08,658
What are you looking for?

608
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,346
Hey demon! You fell into our trap

609
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,273
Trying your tricks with our king?

610
00:52:19,283 --> 00:52:19,883
Shoot

611
00:52:22,908 --> 00:52:23,808
Shoot some more

612
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:27,585
My turn in the center

613
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,860
Why am I king? To twiddle my thumbs?

614
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:31,456
Will it reach?

615
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:36,801
That was a deliberate shot

616
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:38,133
Clap-clap!

617
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,603
He has fainted, right?

618
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:09,825
Useless chameleon, faster

619
00:53:24,158 --> 00:53:25,565
Let us not wait any longer

620
00:53:25,575 --> 00:53:28,898
The 3 demons who came to destroy the
land of the Villiputs

621
00:53:28,908 --> 00:53:30,108
And the talking bird

622
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:34,910
I hereby order the spider with its
poisonous tentacles to kill them

623
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:55,045
Father, stop

624
00:53:56,991 --> 00:54:00,111
If you look at the demon's eyes, he
doesn't seem evil

625
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:04,186
Why don't we inquire first and then
punish them?

626
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:07,003
Stop winding

627
00:54:08,533 --> 00:54:10,213
Untie that demon's gag alone

628
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:25,403
King of all the 'Villiputs'

629
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:27,511
We are not demons

630
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,420
But normal humans disguised like them

631
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:35,621
We are from Vairanallur

632
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:39,631
The demons have kidnapped my wife
Pavalamalli

633
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:42,613
How cruel is that!

634
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:45,806
To save her and to free our land from
captivity...

635
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,706
...we are heading towards Vethala Desam

636
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,040
Is that right?

637
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:52,783
Soldier, remove his fangs

638
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:04,425
Thank God!

639
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:07,523
We would have killed these innocent men

640
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:08,493
First untie them

641
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,100
Well done, dear

642
00:55:11,158 --> 00:55:12,398
Your brain and brawn match!

643
00:55:12,408 --> 00:55:14,398
So minuuute and yet so mischievous

644
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:15,940
I'm the king of the Villiputs

645
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:16,730
Korkai Newton

646
00:55:18,158 --> 00:55:19,058
This is my wife

647
00:55:19,491 --> 00:55:20,391
Fleming Sundari

648
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:23,333
She's my only darling daughter

649
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:24,470
Einstein Kamakshi

650
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:28,185
The demon clan is our enemy too

651
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,690
When they drink Soma, they pierce us
with a toothpick

652
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,481
Dip us in chutney and gobble us whole

653
00:55:32,491 --> 00:55:33,940
Born to a grinding stone!

654
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,440
They are the reason for the decline in
our population

655
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:39,090
Let's first welcome you according to our
clan

656
00:55:40,866 --> 00:55:41,646
Who is there?

657
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,100
Blow your bugle

658
00:56:25,408 --> 00:56:28,408
"Jingiliya jingiliya Miss Teeny-weeny
dazzling hey"

659
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:34,913
"Jingiliya jingiliya Mr Teeny-weeny
sizzling hey"

660
00:56:38,283 --> 00:56:41,883
"Hey! Jingiliya jingiliya This girl is
epitome of femininity"

661
00:56:45,616 --> 00:56:48,796
"Jingiliya jingiliya This boy
personifies masculinity"

662
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,008
"She captured me She made me dizzy"

663
00:56:55,575 --> 00:56:57,495
"With her eyes sparkling starry"

664
00:56:59,075 --> 00:57:02,356
"This sole soul mate of mine kindled in
me a spark divine"

665
00:57:02,366 --> 00:57:04,766
"With eyes lit by a matchstick, sublime"

666
00:57:05,491 --> 00:57:09,151
"God willing, my little 6-inches It's
only you on my mattress"

667
00:57:09,283 --> 00:57:12,343
"Jingiliya jingiliya Miss Itsy-bitsy
mesmerizes hey"

668
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:19,133
"Hey! Jingiliya jingiliya This
Villiputian knows how to play"

669
00:58:03,408 --> 00:58:04,608
"Last night...ahem!"

670
00:58:04,908 --> 00:58:06,773
"What happened? Unburden...open"

671
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:07,983
"She came in person"

672
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:10,231
"Goodness gracious Gone for a toss"

673
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:11,523
"Her sari she undraped"

674
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:13,273
"Breath hopped Words stopped"

675
00:58:13,283 --> 00:58:14,783
"She kept me blindfolded"

676
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,630
"All in vain Down the drain"

677
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,890
"With skin as fair as lemon
Mangoes-endowed woman"

678
00:58:20,325 --> 00:58:23,565
"Without you in my forest flowers don't
bloom in earnest"

679
00:58:23,575 --> 00:58:26,815
"Without you next to me I don't feel
hungry or thirsty"

680
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:30,241
"Without you to dote koel can't sing a
single note"

681
00:58:30,283 --> 00:58:33,898
"With buds concealed in a basket don't
make this man go berserk"

682
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:36,848
"Jingiliya jingiliya Pint sized,
delicate darling"

683
00:58:40,408 --> 00:58:43,168
"Jingiliya jingiliya Isn't he quite
something?"

684
00:59:17,783 --> 00:59:19,273
"In the master's chamber"

685
00:59:19,283 --> 00:59:21,148
"What happened there? Come on, share"

686
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:22,478
"He tugged and hugged"

687
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:24,273
"God forbid! Gone with the wind"

688
00:59:24,283 --> 00:59:25,940
"Cheek-ily he gave a hickey"

689
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,210
"Encore Tell me more"

690
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,090
"I woke up...alas!"

691
00:59:29,408 --> 00:59:31,273
"Goodness gracious Gone for a toss"

692
00:59:31,283 --> 00:59:34,523
"Good Samaritan no doubt In bed a
Casanova out and out"

693
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:38,055
"She's a sweet piece of candy Tuck her
in your cheek handy"

694
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:41,398
"During the day of no use is she At
night turns me on to a T"

695
00:59:41,408 --> 00:59:44,523
"Don't be scared, my Villiputi Cuddle me
under your arms neatly"

696
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:48,190
"My life is a dry and barren land
Irrigate me with your magic wand"

697
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,020
"Jingiliya jingiliya Miss Villiput is so
lovely"

698
00:59:54,908 --> 00:59:57,548
"Jingiliya jingiliya Mr Villiput is
lover-ly"

699
01:00:15,575 --> 01:00:16,295
'Humongous!'

700
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,855
Friends, how can we be of help to you?

701
01:00:23,325 --> 01:00:25,245
To find the way to Vethala fort-

702
01:00:26,783 --> 01:00:27,743
What's his name?

703
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:28,651
Mochakottai

704
01:00:29,283 --> 01:00:29,943
Machakoodan

705
01:00:30,616 --> 01:00:32,356
I must meet Machakoodan first

706
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,210
We know him very well

707
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:37,800
Know him?

708
01:00:37,991 --> 01:00:39,273
He prophesies the future

709
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:42,943
No one else can tell clearly the
entrance and exit to the fort

710
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:44,188
Yes, the same

711
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,635
We have good ties with him

712
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:50,691
I'll send with you Albert My flying
squad head

713
01:00:51,616 --> 01:00:53,296
And Peter, my army commander

714
01:00:54,366 --> 01:00:56,346
Thank you very much, Your Majesty

715
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,356
Pa, because I am a girl...

716
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:00,481
...till now you've never taken me to the
war field

717
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:02,531
I want to go on this brave mission

718
01:01:02,783 --> 01:01:04,103
Please permit me to go

719
01:01:11,575 --> 01:01:14,106
My daughter Kamakshi will accompany you,
okay?

720
01:01:14,116 --> 01:01:15,496
Thank you, Your Majesty

721
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:19,940
Alpha, Beta, Kama

722
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:21,273
Come back with good news

723
01:01:21,283 --> 01:01:22,303
Yes, Your Majesty

724
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,755
Finally we have reached Sangumalai
region

725
01:01:46,867 --> 01:01:49,747
This is the super centenarian
Machakoodan's house

726
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:51,830
Sir...sir

727
01:01:58,271 --> 01:01:58,871
'Aiyah'

728
01:02:00,313 --> 01:02:00,913
'Ai-yah'

729
01:02:08,688 --> 01:02:12,228
Strange...this jungle-house is swaying,
shaking, swaggering?

730
01:02:25,355 --> 01:02:26,795
Machakoodan is a turtle?

731
01:02:29,563 --> 01:02:31,845
We were looking for an old man and here
sits a turtle

732
01:02:31,855 --> 01:02:33,055
He's really huuuuge!

733
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:35,288
Greetings

734
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,320
Sir, I am Kama Korkai Newton's daughter

735
01:02:38,771 --> 01:02:40,871
This is Marudheera He has a problem

736
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,060
If you could help-

737
01:02:43,438 --> 01:02:44,098
Marudheera?

738
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:46,633
You alone step forward

739
01:02:59,813 --> 01:03:00,773
Roll the boulder

740
01:03:02,896 --> 01:03:03,856
Path will unfold

741
01:03:06,105 --> 01:03:08,085
Roll the boulder Path will unfold

742
01:03:09,188 --> 01:03:11,528
Change your name Strength you will gain

743
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:15,498
Note it down please, quick

744
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:16,801
Write it down

745
01:03:18,063 --> 01:03:18,843
Give it to me

746
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:20,880
In Yavana's bed

747
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:23,588
Key to our fort

748
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:25,616
Fort is ours

749
01:03:27,855 --> 01:03:29,235
If squashed, go and pee

750
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:37,720
Looks like he'll add 'if queasy, go and
crap'

751
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,070
Break the scepter when the sun eclipses

752
01:03:42,896 --> 01:03:45,056
Break the wand when the sun conceals

753
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:49,455
If you do all of this properly there is
a chance you will win

754
01:03:54,188 --> 01:03:55,268
Win...or whatever!

755
01:04:04,063 --> 01:04:05,383
The door has been shut

756
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:09,156
This Mock turtle could have kept his
mouth shut

757
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,866
Kodangi, foolish people speak nonstop

758
01:04:13,396 --> 01:04:15,376
Most of it will be sheer nonsense

759
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:16,886
The wise will speak less

760
01:04:16,896 --> 01:04:18,720
But his words will make a lot of sense

761
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,930
Take your hands off!

762
01:04:20,438 --> 01:04:21,218
Can talk less

763
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:24,651
But like this weirdo, to talk half baked
rubbish-

764
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,340
That's a lot of slippery saliva

765
01:04:39,563 --> 01:04:41,553
He shoved his feet into his mouth!

766
01:04:41,563 --> 01:04:43,843
You've got yourself a place in history

767
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:46,993
I've heard of bears spitting

768
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:50,730
But this is the 1st time a turtle has
spat on a man

769
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,120
I'm so proud of you

770
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:57,690
Here, please eat

771
01:04:57,938 --> 01:04:58,538
Thank you

772
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:01,296
Just a small bit will do Last a whole
day

773
01:05:02,563 --> 01:05:03,943
Alpha and Beta are here

774
01:05:04,605 --> 01:05:05,685
But where is Kama?

775
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:07,391
Kama is right there by Sama

776
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:08,741
Did you eat?

777
01:05:09,396 --> 01:05:10,716
I did, what about you?

778
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,720
What is the buffalo flirting with the
mouse for?

779
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:16,250
I have never seen any girl in this
world...

780
01:05:16,771 --> 01:05:18,811
...with eyes as beautiful as yours

781
01:05:19,813 --> 01:05:22,178
Only if you look close enough you can
actually see her!

782
01:05:22,188 --> 01:05:24,720
He's reeling out poetry about her
dot-sized eyes!

783
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,290
Oh no! Why are you crying?

784
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,310
The moment I saw you my heart broke into
two

785
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:33,941
Kama, I love you whole heartedly

786
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:43,178
This is the last straw! Now they are
kissing each other

787
01:05:43,188 --> 01:05:44,720
You aren't even capable of that

788
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,350
Zip your lips and go to bed

789
01:06:07,188 --> 01:06:07,968
Good heavens!

790
01:06:08,646 --> 01:06:11,226
I take a detour when I see a canal back
home

791
01:06:12,271 --> 01:06:14,011
How will I cross this stream?

792
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:16,970
This looks like it leads to hell

793
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,220
How do we cross this?

794
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:19,428
You're right in lamenting

795
01:06:19,438 --> 01:06:21,803
To complete this bridge and then cross
will take years

796
01:06:21,813 --> 01:06:24,053
What if Soora can just lift us across?

797
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:24,843
Idiot! We can

798
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:26,636
But who will carry them?

799
01:06:26,646 --> 01:06:28,928
If we fall, even our bones can't be
cremated!

800
01:06:28,938 --> 01:06:31,398
Right on time to scare the hell out of
us!

801
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,710
Roll the boulder Path will unfold

802
01:06:52,438 --> 01:06:54,718
Is he looking for some rabbit or what?

803
01:06:56,271 --> 01:06:58,251
Roll the boulder Path will unfold

804
01:07:02,313 --> 01:07:04,011
He's going around like the 9 planets?

805
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:05,941
Our heads spin watching him move

806
01:07:10,105 --> 01:07:11,845
If my calculation is right...

807
01:07:12,188 --> 01:07:14,648
...I need to drop this boulder in that
pit

808
01:07:18,521 --> 01:07:19,721
You can do it...lift

809
01:07:21,105 --> 01:07:21,825
That's right

810
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:24,648
He has lifted it

811
01:07:26,938 --> 01:07:27,538
Bravo!

812
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:32,593
You can do it

813
01:07:32,938 --> 01:07:33,538
Hold tight

814
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:45,428
He has dropped it in

815
01:07:45,438 --> 01:07:46,158
Really heavy

816
01:07:49,688 --> 01:07:52,328
Why does it sound like the earth is
rumbling?

817
01:07:54,355 --> 01:07:55,495
It has come out now

818
01:08:55,105 --> 01:08:57,265
I don't know which direction to take

819
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:59,350
That's a 'chengaluthi' leaf

820
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,553
This is a magic leaf that shows the way!

821
01:09:04,563 --> 01:09:05,163
Pick it up

822
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:06,810
Kama, get the book

823
01:09:09,188 --> 01:09:10,553
Look here, it is written

824
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,220
If you make a leaf-whistle and blow...

825
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,875
-Wind will flow!
-Cuss words galore!!

826
01:09:13,896 --> 01:09:16,845
If you whistle, a frog called 'Pachai
vaayan' will guide us

827
01:09:16,855 --> 01:09:18,761
I thought only a leader shows the way

828
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,011
Even a frog can, huh?

829
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:23,681
If it's the right path, frog or leader,
does it really matter?

830
01:09:25,438 --> 01:09:26,878
Try blowing it once more

831
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:31,518
Look! A green frog

832
01:09:33,646 --> 01:09:36,226
Appeared out of the blue as soon as you
blew

833
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:41,768
Help me up, please

834
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:47,931
Marudheera, without hesitating ask the
frog to show us the way

835
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:50,976
Can you tell us the way to the Vethala
fort?

836
01:09:57,396 --> 01:09:58,803
Don't blow the frog away

837
01:09:58,813 --> 01:10:00,470
Let's look up what's written again

838
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,100
'Pachai vaayan' will appear

839
01:10:02,605 --> 01:10:06,085
If a man who is married but not
consummated his marriage...

840
01:10:07,646 --> 01:10:10,766
...asks for directions and licks the
back of the frog

841
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:14,033
God help me!

842
01:10:14,605 --> 01:10:16,225
...it will show you the way

843
01:10:17,688 --> 01:10:19,908
'Why is he blowing the conch my way?'

844
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:24,095
Instead of making out with Tharagai I'm
stuck here...

845
01:10:24,105 --> 01:10:26,325
...between this rock and a hard place

846
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:28,970
Don't worry so much Just lick the frog

847
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,480
Shut up, you turkey berry

848
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:31,450
Yes, lick it

849
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:33,786
Fast, just lick it!

850
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:34,455
Stop it

851
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:38,261
Is this a sweet offering from a temple
to lick and relish?

852
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:40,470
It's a frog that swallows a snake for
breakfast

853
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,680
The snake won't mind

854
01:10:41,896 --> 01:10:42,496
Just do it

855
01:10:44,188 --> 01:10:45,388
Go ahead, bro...lick

856
01:10:45,688 --> 01:10:46,468
My dear wife!

857
01:10:54,771 --> 01:10:58,071
Goddamn green frog! Tell me Where are
the Vethala hills?

858
01:11:04,855 --> 01:11:06,595
Why is he pointing this side?

859
01:11:07,105 --> 01:11:08,365
Oh! So that's the way

860
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:11,476
The green frog has given us the green
signal

861
01:11:24,188 --> 01:11:24,788
(scream)

862
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,248
The wonder drug is in this

863
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:37,161
Where is he running off to without
taking it?

864
01:15:31,605 --> 01:15:32,925
May I ask who you are?

865
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,200
Who are you?

866
01:15:42,563 --> 01:15:44,663
What are you doing to our princess?

867
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:45,580
Princess-

868
01:15:46,697 --> 01:15:47,297
Answer me

869
01:15:47,688 --> 01:15:48,948
Who the hell are you?

870
01:15:49,784 --> 01:15:52,784
When your princess was being chased by a
leopard...

871
01:15:53,313 --> 01:15:55,720
...were you out picking tamarind pods,
huh?

872
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:56,870
He is our commander

873
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:16,210
He is the one who saved me from being
killed by the leopard

874
01:16:25,105 --> 01:16:27,805
I am Jaladharanga General of the Vethala
Desam

875
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:31,241
Yes, my job is to pluck tamarind pods

876
01:16:33,105 --> 01:16:34,005
What about you?

877
01:16:34,271 --> 01:16:36,671
We are Kangini demons from the Himalayas

878
01:16:42,021 --> 01:16:43,401
Take a look at our eyes

879
01:16:47,188 --> 01:16:49,708
I am the prince of medicine in Kangini
land

880
01:16:51,646 --> 01:16:54,106
I prepare the medicine from tigers
usually

881
01:16:56,938 --> 01:16:57,958
Not tamarind pods

882
01:16:59,021 --> 01:17:00,041
From tiger's milk

883
01:17:00,771 --> 01:17:02,751
You have brought medicine for me?

884
01:17:03,188 --> 01:17:06,008
Not just you but for all the people of
your land

885
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:11,703
Hereafter see how this tiger's medicine
works

886
01:17:14,021 --> 01:17:16,421
In that case, only I will take you there

887
01:17:16,688 --> 01:17:19,388
Don't worry, I am sure I can find my way
there

888
01:17:22,188 --> 01:17:23,928
I've checked their belongings

889
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:26,601
The bags only contain herbal roots and
seeds

890
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,580
Why should a doctor carry a weapon?

891
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:38,450
Take it away

892
01:17:55,021 --> 01:17:58,141
Marudheera, they have taken away our
biggest strength

893
01:17:59,688 --> 01:18:01,848
We are like snakes without fangs now

894
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:04,230
We have entered the arena

895
01:18:05,521 --> 01:18:07,321
Let's see one way or the other

896
01:18:52,678 --> 01:18:53,758
Whoa! Magnificent!

897
01:18:56,261 --> 01:18:56,861
Marudheera

898
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,420
Don't show your fear

899
01:19:02,095 --> 01:19:03,055
What did he say?

900
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:06,001
Even if death turns you upside down
flat...

901
01:19:06,011 --> 01:19:07,871
...shouldn't show fear it seems

902
01:19:36,136 --> 01:19:36,916
Who are they?

903
01:19:39,345 --> 01:19:40,425
They look pathetic

904
01:19:41,636 --> 01:19:42,956
'She won't eat us up!'

905
01:19:52,845 --> 01:19:54,705
'Is she a queen or a magician?'

906
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,170
Where are they from?

907
01:20:04,178 --> 01:20:06,098
You heard the queen, didn't you?

908
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,660
We have brought herbal supplies from
Kangini Desam

909
01:20:14,803 --> 01:20:16,963
I'm Marudheera The prince of healing

910
01:20:17,678 --> 01:20:19,918
Low blood cell count causes Neutropenia

911
01:20:19,928 --> 01:20:21,368
3 people die every month

912
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:25,120
You took your own sweet time to come
here

913
01:20:27,011 --> 01:20:29,591
Shall we say we had 'the loosies' on the
way

914
01:20:35,886 --> 01:20:36,486
Where-

915
01:20:42,053 --> 01:20:45,210
This royal lady suddenly flits place to
place to show us her palace

916
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,780
Tell me, prince of Kangini

917
01:20:48,386 --> 01:20:50,906
When I was coming back with the
princess...

918
01:20:51,761 --> 01:20:53,621
...I saw them near Vulture hill

919
01:20:55,845 --> 01:20:59,625
So he is the prince who saved my
daughter from the black leopard

920
01:21:00,845 --> 01:21:01,805
I heard about it

921
01:21:03,595 --> 01:21:04,555
I am glad indeed

922
01:21:06,678 --> 01:21:07,518
What happened?

923
01:21:16,178 --> 01:21:17,498
Tell me Why the delay?

924
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:21,460
Your Majesty, a violent storm battered
our Kangini land

925
01:21:22,761 --> 01:21:24,861
All the herbal plants were uprooted

926
01:21:25,053 --> 01:21:26,613
That's why we were delayed

927
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:30,150
How long does it take for you to prepare
the medicine?

928
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:31,281
Cook up something

929
01:21:32,636 --> 01:21:35,636
First we need to boil and strain the
'koruku' seeds

930
01:21:37,178 --> 01:21:40,178
Then we need to crush special herbal
leaves by hand

931
01:21:41,553 --> 01:21:43,173
I don't care about all that

932
01:21:43,886 --> 01:21:45,626
When will I get the medicine?

933
01:21:47,845 --> 01:21:49,045
It can be done in...

934
01:21:49,428 --> 01:21:50,028
...3 days

935
01:21:51,136 --> 01:21:54,856
When it is ready you will prove it can
cure the disease, right?

936
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,340
Why don't I hear an answer?

937
01:22:01,178 --> 01:22:02,558
De...de...definitely...

938
01:22:03,095 --> 01:22:05,668
...we will prove the disease can be
cured, Your Majesty

939
01:22:05,678 --> 01:22:06,278
Good

940
01:22:06,553 --> 01:22:07,333
Get some rest

941
01:22:09,386 --> 01:22:10,826
And then start your work

942
01:22:11,136 --> 01:22:13,236
Thank you...very much, Your Majesty

943
01:22:16,803 --> 01:22:18,001
This Turkey berry fellow!

944
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:20,126
Who is he targeting and rolling the
dice?

945
01:22:20,136 --> 01:22:21,936
To close our chapter of course

946
01:22:22,595 --> 01:22:24,575
What is your Oracle saying, Beta?

947
01:22:25,553 --> 01:22:28,073
It says good news will fly in from the
west

948
01:22:28,386 --> 01:22:29,526
Good news it seems!

949
01:22:34,886 --> 01:22:37,286
It's our Soora and riding on him is
Alpha

950
01:22:38,553 --> 01:22:39,453
The wonder drug

951
01:22:39,845 --> 01:22:41,045
We found the capsule

952
01:22:42,011 --> 01:22:43,626
Only after seeing this in your hand...

953
01:22:43,636 --> 01:22:45,616
...my heart started beating again

954
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:46,361
Soora

955
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:48,195
Alpha

956
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:50,350
Don't...I feel ticklish

957
01:22:51,886 --> 01:22:53,960
For God's sake switch the drug to
another place

958
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,168
Let's transfer it into the capsule in
our bag

959
01:22:56,178 --> 01:22:57,618
And fill this with water

960
01:22:59,136 --> 01:23:00,516
Marudheera...Marudheera

961
01:23:01,428 --> 01:23:05,210
Soora and Alpha while collecting this
medicine got wind of some news

962
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:05,820
What?

963
01:23:06,136 --> 01:23:08,043
The girl kidnapped from Vairanallur...

964
01:23:08,053 --> 01:23:10,873
...will be sacrificed in a royal ritual
it seems

965
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:15,731
Pavalamalli?

966
01:23:18,595 --> 01:23:19,735
Where could she be?

967
01:23:39,386 --> 01:23:42,026
The sceptre burns red hot like a ball of
fire

968
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:47,561
This is no ordinary magic wand

969
01:23:47,886 --> 01:23:50,466
In has trapped within, the souls of 17
lives

970
01:23:56,136 --> 01:23:57,096
Only 2 days left

971
01:23:59,386 --> 01:24:00,706
What we will get is...

972
01:24:01,178 --> 01:24:02,918
...treasure of all treasures!

973
01:24:16,011 --> 01:24:17,931
That mountain must be the prison

974
01:24:19,136 --> 01:24:23,576
The way my stomach is somersaulting the
entire fort seems like prison to me

975
01:24:23,845 --> 01:24:25,765
Help me stop my 'loosies' please

976
01:24:37,678 --> 01:24:39,598
The queen has 4 daughters, anna?

977
01:24:40,553 --> 01:24:41,573
1 is the princess

978
01:24:41,845 --> 01:24:43,105
The other 3 come free

979
01:25:09,928 --> 01:25:11,668
Marudheera drink the medicine

980
01:25:13,178 --> 01:25:13,838
Wonder drug

981
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:28,361
Save us!

982
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,980
Was he born an adult?

983
01:25:30,386 --> 01:25:30,986
Yes, anna

984
01:25:31,261 --> 01:25:33,543
Why is he just walking instead of
flying?

985
01:25:33,553 --> 01:25:34,513
Don't know, anna

986
01:25:34,886 --> 01:25:36,266
He's heading towards us

987
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:37,250
-He's here
-GO

988
01:25:43,303 --> 01:25:44,383
Turn around and go

989
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,120
He has just 1 eye Where is the other
one?

990
01:26:07,178 --> 01:26:09,278
When Marudheera put out his hand...

991
01:26:10,678 --> 01:26:12,238
...why did Mamuzhiya stop?

992
01:26:14,345 --> 01:26:15,365
Even I am puzzled

993
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:22,573
How did you combat such an ogre of a
demon?

994
01:26:25,386 --> 01:26:28,026
When I'm next to a beautiful girl like
you...

995
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,200
...danger is like eating a donut!

996
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:33,613
'He lays it really thick!'

997
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:36,861
Mother

998
01:26:44,553 --> 01:26:45,710
What did I tell you?

999
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,043
The medicine is underneath

1000
01:26:47,053 --> 01:26:48,673
The capsule just has water!

1001
01:26:48,928 --> 01:26:51,460
When you saw that Cyclops I repeatedly
asked you to drink it

1002
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:54,626
You drank the water instead and with
bravado faced him eye to eye!

1003
01:26:54,636 --> 01:26:56,136
That's right I forgot too

1004
01:26:57,553 --> 01:26:59,043
So what I drank was water?

1005
01:26:59,053 --> 01:27:00,493
Then what did you think?

1006
01:27:01,845 --> 01:27:03,345
When I held up my hand...

1007
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,835
...why did Cyclops stop in his tracks?

1008
01:27:05,845 --> 01:27:07,645
You should ask Cyclops himself

1009
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:21,470
Greetings, Royal Highness

1010
01:27:22,845 --> 01:27:24,165
Greetings, Brave heart

1011
01:27:24,678 --> 01:27:28,218
Goodness! Not a single girl in our clan
can match her beauty

1012
01:27:32,053 --> 01:27:33,493
What are you looking at?

1013
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:35,271
Do you like my dress?

1014
01:27:37,761 --> 01:27:40,641
To tell you the truth, I can't even see
any dress

1015
01:27:43,053 --> 01:27:44,073
What did you say?

1016
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:45,861
Finito!

1017
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:48,440
They can serve us gruel in the prison

1018
01:27:48,803 --> 01:27:51,563
Don't misunderstand what I said, Royal
Highness

1019
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:54,411
I meant, your beauty hid everything else

1020
01:28:00,053 --> 01:28:01,853
Alright, step in for the feast

1021
01:28:05,428 --> 01:28:08,188
I am glad you are at the table of Yavana
'rani'

1022
01:28:08,428 --> 01:28:11,068
...in the royal abode of the valorous
Vethals

1023
01:28:11,261 --> 01:28:12,401
Let the feast begin

1024
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:22,835
Looks like if the gravy there has to be
passed on to us...

1025
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:24,710
...we'll need a horse to bring it

1026
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,380
Forget that

1027
01:28:26,178 --> 01:28:27,078
Look over there

1028
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:30,675
What a huge crocodile barbecued on its
belly

1029
01:28:31,428 --> 01:28:34,168
Being gluttonous, don't end up with
'loosies' again

1030
01:28:34,178 --> 01:28:35,618
To our flights of fancy!

1031
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,360
Should we also drink to our flights of
fancy?

1032
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:45,873
What on earth is this?

1033
01:28:51,136 --> 01:28:55,085
It is our tradition for us to clink our
glasses with those of our guests

1034
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:56,175
Clink all you want

1035
01:28:59,053 --> 01:29:00,433
To our flights of fancy

1036
01:29:04,053 --> 01:29:07,173
Why should we bathe because of your
flights of fancy?

1037
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:13,378
We take great pride in having met queen
Yavana

1038
01:29:13,803 --> 01:29:16,143
To rule 56 villages is not child's play

1039
01:29:17,053 --> 01:29:17,653
Yes

1040
01:29:18,303 --> 01:29:19,383
They are my people

1041
01:29:20,386 --> 01:29:21,286
I live for them

1042
01:29:22,053 --> 01:29:23,793
Very heartening, Your Majesty

1043
01:29:31,303 --> 01:29:33,223
You thought I would say so, huh?

1044
01:29:37,053 --> 01:29:40,173
Only those who belong to my Vethal clan
are my people

1045
01:29:41,845 --> 01:29:42,445
Alright

1046
01:29:43,053 --> 01:29:45,093
Cat got your tongue, faith healer?

1047
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:49,245
It's the same in our land The demons
rule

1048
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:52,931
Ordinary people are our captives

1049
01:29:53,053 --> 01:29:53,653
Very true

1050
01:30:43,761 --> 01:30:46,821

sought after fish in the sea"

1066
01:33:01,303 --> 01:33:03,703
"But both can never be in your
captivity"

1067

man-made controversy"

1075

Kama isn't a toy for you to play in your
pocket, Sama

1086
01:35:22,095 --> 01:35:23,210
Don't bring up that topic

1087
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:24,480
-Listen to me
-I won't

1088
01:35:24,678 --> 01:35:26,958
In Yavana's bed is the key to our fort

1089
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:31,720
After queen Yavana has slept the fort
belongs to us

1090
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:36,690
Sounds right

1091
01:35:38,595 --> 01:35:40,035
All the demi gods I know

1092
01:35:40,928 --> 01:35:42,248
How atrocious this is!

1093
01:35:42,761 --> 01:35:45,543
I might as well have been stuck in the
jaws of a demon

1094
01:35:45,553 --> 01:35:48,673
Think of it as mint 'chutney' and lick
it quick, anna

1095
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:53,070
Yuck!

1096
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:55,611
Green frog

1097
01:35:56,136 --> 01:35:57,396
Where is Pavalamalli?

1098
01:36:02,011 --> 01:36:03,331
Why is he pointing up?

1099
01:36:03,845 --> 01:36:05,705
Has Pavalamalli gone to Heaven?

1100
01:36:06,345 --> 01:36:07,125
You half-wit!

1101
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:07,820
Who?

1102
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:09,660
She is in the top storey

1103
01:36:30,845 --> 01:36:31,445
Good lord!

1104
01:36:36,053 --> 01:36:37,313
Alright, see you soon

1105
01:37:11,011 --> 01:37:11,611
Malli?

1106
01:37:12,053 --> 01:37:12,773
Pavalamalli?

1107
01:37:16,845 --> 01:37:18,045
Your life is with me

1108
01:37:21,136 --> 01:37:24,256
If I have to kill you, they have to
snuff my life out

1109
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:26,720
I promise I will save you

1110
01:37:43,928 --> 01:37:46,918
8 minutes have passed Still no sign of
our Marudheera

1111
01:37:46,928 --> 01:37:48,543
Is he in some sort of danger?

1112
01:37:48,553 --> 01:37:51,733
The priest blessed us with love,
laughter and children

1113
01:37:52,178 --> 01:37:54,998
Looks like Tharagai won't become a
mother at all

1114
01:37:55,053 --> 01:37:57,543
Hey Kodangi, only if she dies she can't
become a mother

1115
01:37:57,553 --> 01:37:59,543
Even if you die, she can give birth to
children

1116
01:37:59,553 --> 01:38:02,073
-You jinxed-mouth fellow
-Alright...alright

1117
01:38:20,095 --> 01:38:22,855
From the beginning your actions are
topsy-turvy

1118
01:38:25,845 --> 01:38:27,585
Tell me honestly who are you?

1119
01:38:28,303 --> 01:38:30,403
Why have you come into our kingdom?

1120
01:38:34,178 --> 01:38:34,778
Answer

1121
01:38:50,053 --> 01:38:51,001
Nothing...nothing

1122
01:38:51,011 --> 01:38:52,043
I hit you playfully

1123
01:38:52,053 --> 01:38:55,173
'Is it 8 minutes already since I drank
the medicine?'

1124
01:39:03,428 --> 01:39:05,768
Did Marudheera faint with just 1 punch?

1125
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:10,436
I have my doubts if he is really part of
the Vethal clan

1126
01:39:12,053 --> 01:39:13,013
Tomorrow morning

1127
01:39:14,261 --> 01:39:16,301
Bring him to the sacrificial altar

1128
01:39:17,803 --> 01:39:19,183
Let the people assemble

1129
01:39:53,406 --> 01:39:55,086
Gave the wonder drug, right?

1130
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:58,623
Once the drug starts working, watch
Marudheera in action

1131
01:39:59,031 --> 01:40:00,951
Prince of physicians, Marudheera

1132
01:40:02,823 --> 01:40:05,523
I have my own doubts if you're a demon
at all!

1133
01:40:07,739 --> 01:40:09,599
You won't know by interrogating

1134
01:40:10,948 --> 01:40:13,146
You can find out only if you see me in
action

1135
01:40:13,156 --> 01:40:15,136
Send your demons to fight with me

1136
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:26,219
You are just a dewdrop that melts

1137
01:40:26,323 --> 01:40:28,771
He's the malefic Saturn who will stop
your pulse

1138
01:40:28,781 --> 01:40:31,541
I melt like a dewdrop only for the sake
of love

1139
01:40:31,614 --> 01:40:33,174
When it comes to enmity...

1140
01:40:35,031 --> 01:40:35,931
...I am a tiger

1141
01:42:35,823 --> 01:42:37,203
The medicine is working

1142
01:44:02,573 --> 01:44:03,173
Bravo!

1143
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:09,361
Brother, it's important to know if
strength is through force or skill

1144
01:44:27,156 --> 01:44:29,916
When you lost the fight you are as good
as dead

1145
01:44:33,864 --> 01:44:35,304
Queen doesn't suspect me

1146
01:44:37,531 --> 01:44:40,471
But the middle men are the ones who are
suspicious

1147
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:42,839
Tell me who else should I prove to?

1148
01:44:44,281 --> 01:44:45,721
Shall I prove it to you?

1149
01:44:46,156 --> 01:44:46,756
Or you...?

1150
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:48,298
Enough

1151
01:44:49,114 --> 01:44:50,374
Who else is in doubt?

1152
01:44:51,364 --> 01:44:51,964
To you...?

1153
01:44:52,573 --> 01:44:53,173
You...?

1154
01:44:54,114 --> 01:44:57,063
Why is he playing the drums for a
concert that's over?

1155
01:44:57,073 --> 01:44:58,453
Can you prove it to me?

1156
01:45:07,355 --> 01:45:08,735
I'm sure it isn't wrong

1157
01:45:09,378 --> 01:45:10,758
Certainly, Your Majesty

1158
01:45:11,198 --> 01:45:12,038
-My God!
-What?

1159
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:15,058
8 minutes of magic time is over

1160
01:45:15,114 --> 01:45:17,729
That means the malefic effects of Saturn
has started now

1161
01:45:17,739 --> 01:45:19,599
You fought and defeated a demon

1162
01:45:20,531 --> 01:45:24,431
But according to our tradition you have
to take part in the climax

1163
01:45:25,114 --> 01:45:26,194
Single Vethal duel

1164
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:32,771
This madam's livelihood seems to be
conducting fights

1165
01:45:32,781 --> 01:45:36,081
If you win this, I'll accept you as a
demon beyond doubt

1166
01:45:43,656 --> 01:45:45,456
This is the single Vethal-hoop

1167
01:45:47,198 --> 01:45:49,178
Soora, quick Give him the capsule

1168
01:45:49,531 --> 01:45:51,211
Demons can enter on one side

1169
01:45:52,031 --> 01:45:53,291
And exit on the other

1170
01:45:53,698 --> 01:45:55,798
The demon's body can take this heat

1171
01:45:58,031 --> 01:46:00,251
But a human body will burn to cinders

1172
01:46:01,156 --> 01:46:02,656
Please don't...don't, sir

1173
01:46:05,114 --> 01:46:06,314
Please let go of him

1174
01:46:08,031 --> 01:46:09,411
-Save me, sir
-Spare him

1175
01:46:34,073 --> 01:46:36,771
Anna, I can hear the sound of the
funeral conch

1176
01:46:36,781 --> 01:46:38,041
-I don't hear it
-Why?

1177
01:46:39,031 --> 01:46:40,531
Because I'm already dead!

1178
01:47:11,531 --> 01:47:12,131
Kaput!

1179
01:47:57,864 --> 01:47:59,784
No one can fool our queen Yavana

1180
01:49:05,906 --> 01:49:07,886
My daughter princess Mandakini...

1181
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:11,238
...will marry the brave Marudheera

1182
01:49:25,239 --> 01:49:27,519
I shall announce the wedding date soon

1183
01:49:55,448 --> 01:49:59,828
"Like a baby calf playful and sprightly
this beautiful girl captivates me"

1184
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:08,491
"He's like a two-tailed sparrow To this
handsome hulk, a big hello"

1185
01:50:13,448 --> 01:50:16,028
"On your forehead vermilion red dot
adorned"

1186
01:50:16,198 --> 01:50:18,598
"On my cheeks, lassie kiss me
repeatedly"

1187
01:50:20,156 --> 01:50:21,776
"Man of intellect, my dear"

1188
01:50:22,406 --> 01:50:25,706
"I am a bud about to flower Tendril in
your hand tender"

1189
01:50:26,364 --> 01:50:28,044
"You are a challenge for me"

1190
01:50:29,448 --> 01:50:33,828
"On your forehead I want to kiss you
Tickle you pink is what I want to do"

1191
01:50:35,614 --> 01:50:39,214
"Deer, honey, peacock, koel All these
blended is you, damsel"

1192
01:50:41,656 --> 01:50:45,676
"My precious princess, sweet jaggery
Come to me, my river Mandakini"

1193
01:50:53,239 --> 01:50:57,619
"Like a baby calf playful and sprightly
this beautiful girl captivates me"

1194
01:50:59,823 --> 01:51:03,903
"He's like a two-tailed sparrow To this
mischievous imp, a big hello"

1195
01:51:23,698 --> 01:51:26,998
"Your Imperial Majesty, dear I'm your
lucky mascot deer"

1196
01:51:28,031 --> 01:51:31,691
"You are a man, one and only Don't kiss
my honey layered body"

1197
01:51:32,823 --> 01:51:35,823
"Hey maiden so beautiful You're a
mermaid graceful"

1198
01:51:36,531 --> 01:51:40,191
"Your legs are pillars of art Nectar
that you are, don't part"

1199
01:51:41,114 --> 01:51:43,814
"With eyes that thieve don't make me
conceive"

1200
01:51:44,364 --> 01:51:47,304
"Cheek to cheek, don't take what I
cannot partake"

1201
01:51:47,406 --> 01:51:50,886
"Deer, honey, peacock, koel All these
fused is you, damsel"

1202
01:51:53,364 --> 01:51:57,564
"My precious princess, sweet jaggery
Come to me, my princess Mandakini"

1203
01:52:29,989 --> 01:52:33,854
"My dear wish-fulfilling jewel Slender
like a palm tree, archangel"

1204
01:52:33,864 --> 01:52:37,044
"I will make you mine, dearie Kiss me,
don't leave me"

1205
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:42,016
"Brave warrior marvelled You're like
teak wood chiselled"

1206
01:52:42,156 --> 01:52:46,356
"You are my betel leaf's areca nut my
taste buds yearn, don't walk out"

1207
01:52:47,031 --> 01:52:50,931
"With a bouquet of roses red don't tempt
my heart that's innocent"

1208
01:52:53,031 --> 01:52:56,511
"Deer, honey, peacock, koel All these
mixed is you, damsel"

1209
01:52:59,156 --> 01:53:02,996
"My precious prince, sweet jaggery I am
yours forever, Mandakini"

1210
01:53:05,364 --> 01:53:09,744
"Like a baby calf playful and sprightly
this beautiful girl captivates me"

1211
01:53:11,114 --> 01:53:15,134
"He's like a two-tailed sparrow To this
naughty fellow, a big hello"

1212
01:53:28,031 --> 01:53:30,371
Marudheera passed even the Vethal test!

1213
01:53:32,448 --> 01:53:35,628
First and foremost, without anyone
knowing about it...

1214
01:53:37,864 --> 01:53:39,604
...close Marudheera's chapter

1215
01:53:40,656 --> 01:53:42,576
Call for that Pei-azhagu kuruvi?

1216
01:53:43,031 --> 01:53:44,411
They seem so distressed

1217
01:53:45,031 --> 01:53:46,411
He has got up...finally

1218
01:53:47,823 --> 01:53:49,083
My favorite demi god!

1219
01:53:51,031 --> 01:53:52,471
I'm very confused myself

1220
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:57,688
Why didn't I die in the Vethal single
hoop test?

1221
01:53:57,698 --> 01:53:58,298
Don't know

1222
01:54:00,156 --> 01:54:00,756
Marudheera

1223
01:54:02,406 --> 01:54:05,226
The palace washerman wanted to meet you
secretly

1224
01:54:22,437 --> 01:54:24,417
I saw this leaf in your bedspread

1225
01:54:26,104 --> 01:54:28,624
I've been eating this from when I was
young

1226
01:54:29,687 --> 01:54:31,187
Do you know what it does?

1227
01:54:32,104 --> 01:54:34,564
To control the demonic power within
you...

1228
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:37,310
...and show you as an ordinary man

1229
01:54:37,979 --> 01:54:40,499
...is the extraordinary nature of this
herb

1230
01:54:40,854 --> 01:54:41,574
Then am I...

1231
01:54:41,937 --> 01:54:42,657
...a Vethal?

1232
01:54:43,187 --> 01:54:43,787
Yes

1233
01:54:44,145 --> 01:54:45,345
Yes, you are a demon

1234
01:54:47,479 --> 01:54:49,339
Do you know who your father is?

1235
01:54:52,562 --> 01:54:55,322
With his single intense glare like a
volcano...

1236
01:54:55,604 --> 01:54:58,544
...Pulivendha has the ability to set
ablaze 10 men

1237
01:54:59,812 --> 01:55:01,852
First see if he rushes to your aid

1238
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:02,495
Oh God!

1239
01:55:03,145 --> 01:55:05,005
Ask your Pulivendha to come now

1240
01:55:05,187 --> 01:55:06,087
Ask him to come

1241
01:55:11,979 --> 01:55:13,239
You dare laugh at me?

1242
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,020
Can't you hear the sound?

1243
01:55:15,187 --> 01:55:17,167
Our prince has come to our rescue

1244
01:55:21,229 --> 01:55:22,969
Our savior with immense power

1245
01:55:23,687 --> 01:55:25,787
The knife which will take your life

1246
01:59:05,812 --> 01:59:09,885
'The people were overjoyed by your
father Pulivendha's timely arrival'

1247
01:59:09,895 --> 01:59:12,895
'Your mother Pushpa radha bearing you
also arrived'

1248
01:59:13,562 --> 01:59:17,402
'Pulivendha had left his home 18 years
ago to learn all the arts'

1249
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:23,220
'He returned because his people of
Vagainallur called him to save them'

1250
01:59:24,937 --> 01:59:28,057
Why are they tying up our brave men and
killing them?

1251
01:59:31,729 --> 01:59:33,709
Who is to blame? You or the king?

1252
01:59:36,645 --> 01:59:38,325
The new General Jaladharanga

1253
01:59:42,062 --> 01:59:44,282
'Your grandfather Karunthelnandha...'

1254
01:59:44,979 --> 01:59:48,099
'...has done a lot of good for all the
villages here'

1255
01:59:48,729 --> 01:59:51,309
'His only blunder was his choice of
General'

1256
01:59:54,437 --> 01:59:57,927
'From that day onwards, he made everyone
dance to his tunes'

1257
01:59:57,937 --> 02:00:01,237
'But he hid it very well from the king
and the princess'

1258
02:00:03,812 --> 02:00:06,135
Through generations in all the
villages...

1259
02:00:06,145 --> 02:00:09,385
...2 sacred rituals take place as part
of our tradition

1260
02:00:09,437 --> 02:00:12,737
One is when the seeds are sown called
the 'Uthira pooja'

1261
02:00:13,479 --> 02:00:16,419
The 2nd is during harvesting called
'Paadha pooja'

1262
02:00:18,270 --> 02:00:21,510
After this wretched Jaladharanga came
into our lives...

1263
02:00:22,729 --> 02:00:25,369
...we haven't performed 'Paadha pooja'
at all

1264
02:00:26,937 --> 02:00:30,635
This thanksgiving to God should be
performed day after tomorrow

1265
02:00:30,645 --> 02:00:31,365
But it won't

1266
02:00:32,854 --> 02:00:33,514
It will, ma

1267
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:36,100
Day after tomorrow

1268
02:00:38,145 --> 02:00:41,205
Thanksgiving to God will be performed in
Vagainallur

1269
02:00:42,062 --> 02:00:43,382
I'll be here till then

1270
02:00:45,937 --> 02:00:48,037
I haven't been born to rule as king

1271
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:52,290
But to ensure my people don't lack
anything

1272
02:00:53,854 --> 02:00:57,754
'The king and princess were waiting for
the arrival of Pulivendha'

1273
02:00:57,937 --> 02:01:00,637
'But they received only a message from
him...'

1274
02:01:01,187 --> 02:01:04,469
'...in which he had conveyed everything,
the whole truth as it is'

1275
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:07,594
'For many years 'Paadha pooja' has not
been performed in Vagainallur'

1276
02:01:07,604 --> 02:01:10,244
'The Vethals are looting the innocent
people'

1277
02:01:11,354 --> 02:01:15,134
'He promised to come with details of the
mastermind behind this'

1278
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,900
'Reading his scroll...'

1279
02:01:17,366 --> 02:01:19,802
'...the king and the princess were right
royally confused'

1280
02:01:19,812 --> 02:01:21,372
'Jaladharanga was shocked'

1281
02:01:24,062 --> 02:01:26,942
'He met a cruel sage called Koduvari
immediately'

1282
02:01:29,687 --> 02:01:32,147
'The sage gave him a powerful voodoo
ring'

1283
02:01:32,312 --> 02:01:34,552
'To draw the princess into a black magic
spell'

1284
02:01:34,562 --> 02:01:37,885
With the hair you gave me from the head
of the princess...

1285
02:01:37,895 --> 02:01:39,094
...I have cast a spell

1286
02:01:39,104 --> 02:01:41,427
I have made a sacrificial ritual in the
cemetery

1287
02:01:41,437 --> 02:01:43,477
And made this ring with witchcraft

1288
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:47,219
'If the leg of the spider in that ring
is pressed...'

1289
02:01:47,229 --> 02:01:50,677
'...the green smoke emanating from it
will fly through the air'

1290
02:01:50,687 --> 02:01:55,067
'Despite the number of people present it
will attack only princess Yavana'

1291
02:01:58,437 --> 02:01:59,277
Your Highness?

1292
02:02:01,937 --> 02:02:03,077
I told you to leave

1293
02:02:05,437 --> 02:02:06,997
'If the ring is broken...'

1294
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:09,800
'...she will become a woman possessed'

1295
02:02:10,104 --> 02:02:14,135
'To imprison the king, Jaladharanga used
the king's daughter as a scapegoat'

1296
02:02:14,145 --> 02:02:17,445
'The entire control fell into the hands
of Jaladharanga'

1297
02:02:19,145 --> 02:02:22,025
So Yavana 'rani' now is a mere puppet on
a string

1298
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:30,040
Along with his savagery, Fate also
joined hands to play an evil game

1299
02:02:32,645 --> 02:02:37,265
'On that specified day, 'Paadha pooja'
in Vagainallur started on a happy note'

1300
02:02:42,645 --> 02:02:46,245
'Jaladharanga resorted to nabbing
Pulivendha the crooked way'

1301
02:02:49,312 --> 02:02:50,152
Pulivendha...?

1302
02:02:55,729 --> 02:02:57,409
God! Our children...oh dear!

1303
02:03:01,645 --> 02:03:03,205
You look just like a tiger

1304
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:06,660
Not only to look at

1305
02:03:10,812 --> 02:03:11,472
Don't worry

1306
02:03:13,062 --> 02:03:14,622
They are not your children

1307
02:03:15,687 --> 02:03:16,287
But mine

1308
02:03:17,937 --> 02:03:19,557
I will definitely save them

1309
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:26,010
One more step forward and your children
will be corpses

1310
02:03:27,645 --> 02:03:31,305
Children are the Heavens bestowed to us
even when we are alive

1311
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:35,280
After butchering them which hell will
you rule?

1312
02:03:36,854 --> 02:03:39,734
I'll stoop to any level to get the reins
to reign

1313
02:03:39,895 --> 02:03:42,055
It will not happen till we are alive

1314
02:03:42,645 --> 02:03:43,545
-YES!
-Of course

1315
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:46,844
After your arrival their fear has
evaporated

1316
02:03:46,854 --> 02:03:48,174
But it has entered you

1317
02:03:50,437 --> 02:03:52,657
The wrongdoer may have a 1000 weapons

1318
02:03:53,604 --> 02:03:55,164
But a good soul has only 1

1319
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:57,620
People

1320
02:03:58,437 --> 02:03:59,037
That's why

1321
02:04:00,937 --> 02:04:03,157
I'll destroy you with your own weapon

1322
02:04:07,437 --> 02:04:10,857
If even 1 drop of blood is shed from
their fragile bodies-

1323
02:04:13,437 --> 02:04:16,857
If you do not wish to witness even 1
drop of blood here...

1324
02:04:34,312 --> 02:04:36,052
...you must drink this poison

1325
02:04:37,229 --> 02:04:38,369
...to the last drop

1326
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:42,650
Not just these children

1327
02:04:44,437 --> 02:04:46,177
Even if you kill all of us...

1328
02:04:47,062 --> 02:04:49,462
...we are not prepared to lose our
prince

1329
02:04:49,895 --> 02:04:51,515
We will not let that happen

1330
02:04:53,479 --> 02:04:54,859
This love is enough, ma

1331
02:04:55,645 --> 02:04:58,945
I'll forsake my life for you how many
ever births I take

1332
02:05:00,687 --> 02:05:04,347
I thought as much when you did not
combat face to face with me

1333
02:05:04,812 --> 02:05:07,332
Will you show us your bravery
aggressively?

1334
02:05:07,437 --> 02:05:09,237
Or end your life submissively?

1335
02:05:22,937 --> 02:05:25,517
If I drink that poison will you let them
go?

1336
02:05:25,604 --> 02:05:26,204
I promise

1337
02:05:27,104 --> 02:05:27,764
I trust you

1338
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:33,930
Don't do it

1339
02:05:35,145 --> 02:05:36,105
You are our heir

1340
02:05:36,937 --> 02:05:38,857
We are willing to lose our lives

1341
02:05:39,937 --> 02:05:40,837
You should live

1342
02:05:41,895 --> 02:05:43,095
Please don't do this

1343
02:05:44,437 --> 02:05:45,217
Don't...don't

1344
02:05:47,645 --> 02:05:48,365
Listen to us

1345
02:05:48,895 --> 02:05:50,455
Do not sacrifice your life

1346
02:05:51,729 --> 02:05:55,389
It is a leader's duty to protect every
single life in his clan

1347
02:05:56,354 --> 02:05:57,194
Don't drink it

1348
02:05:58,645 --> 02:06:00,505
It's your duty to obey my order

1349
02:06:08,062 --> 02:06:09,802
For the sake of the people...

1350
02:06:11,812 --> 02:06:14,032
...I will embrace even death with joy

1351
02:06:15,437 --> 02:06:16,097
Don't do it

1352
02:06:28,979 --> 02:06:31,319
If you die, who will protect this land?

1353
02:06:31,854 --> 02:06:32,454
YOU

1354
02:06:33,687 --> 02:06:36,327
If all of you love your motherland
bravely...

1355
02:06:36,645 --> 02:06:38,025
...a king is not needed

1356
02:06:41,187 --> 02:06:43,107
This land will soon belong to me

1357
02:06:45,604 --> 02:06:47,944
You will be dust to dust ashes to ashes

1358
02:06:51,729 --> 02:06:52,449
Jaladharanga

1359
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:55,430
I am a seed

1360
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:01,360
In the place where my seed is sown
another liberator will blossom

1361
02:07:04,062 --> 02:07:06,822
General, his wife has given birth to a
boy baby

1362
02:07:11,895 --> 02:07:14,055
He has bloomed just as you predicted

1363
02:07:31,437 --> 02:07:32,157
Where is he?

1364
02:07:33,854 --> 02:07:34,454
My baby

1365
02:07:39,854 --> 02:07:40,454
Oh God!

1366
02:07:41,937 --> 02:07:42,537
Pushpa...!

1367
02:08:23,937 --> 02:08:24,777
Kill this baby

1368
02:08:27,937 --> 02:08:30,937
Along with the people set the whole
village on fire

1369
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:53,219
'Men cursed by sage Koduvari who had
been turned into birds...'

1370
02:08:53,229 --> 02:08:55,449
'...were living in the mountain side'

1371
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:58,110
'They saved you from the jaws of death'

1372
02:08:58,354 --> 02:09:01,354
'Nestled you in a nest with an egg by
your side...'

1373
02:09:01,562 --> 02:09:04,094
'...they sent you to safety by nudging
you into the river'

1374
02:09:04,104 --> 02:09:06,144
Is Soora one among the cursed men?

1375
02:09:08,937 --> 02:09:09,537
Yes

1376
02:09:11,437 --> 02:09:12,517
No wonder he talks

1377
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:18,660
Jaladharanga enacted a drama as if a
black leopard killed your parents

1378
02:09:19,437 --> 02:09:22,617
'Princess Yavana got married and a girl
baby was born'

1379
02:09:23,062 --> 02:09:27,142
'Jaladharanga killed her husband and as
usual blamed it on a leopard'

1380
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:29,460
'And convinced everyone'

1381
02:09:29,937 --> 02:09:32,397
'The queen had no idea what was
happening'

1382
02:09:32,645 --> 02:09:34,145
'She believed everything'

1383
02:09:34,229 --> 02:09:36,389
'The princess crowned herself queen'

1384
02:09:39,229 --> 02:09:42,709
'But from that day onwards Jaladharanga
was the mastermind'

1385
02:09:43,145 --> 02:09:46,025
'The cruel sage asked Jaladharanga to
perform...'

1386
02:09:46,437 --> 02:09:48,927
'...a ritual that would bestow
immortality to him'

1387
02:09:48,937 --> 02:09:51,844
'Only a girl with royal lineage can
perform this ritual'

1388
02:09:51,854 --> 02:09:53,714
'On every solar eclipse day...'

1389
02:09:53,854 --> 02:09:58,114
'...he made the innocent queen sacrifice
a maiden born on Full moon day'

1390
02:09:59,312 --> 02:10:02,219
'If this was performed for 18
consecutive years...'

1391
02:10:02,229 --> 02:10:04,219
'...the queen will get immortal powers'

1392
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:08,489
'And if Jaladharanga being a bachelor
had physical relationship with the

1393
02:10:08,499 --> 02:10:08,927
queen'

1394
02:10:08,937 --> 02:10:10,917
'...he would become immortal too'

1395
02:10:11,812 --> 02:10:14,052
'In the end he intends killing the queen
too'

1396
02:10:14,062 --> 02:10:15,142
'This is his plan'

1397
02:10:16,895 --> 02:10:21,155
They have sacrificed innocent victims
for 17 years without any hindrance

1398
02:10:22,854 --> 02:10:24,114
This is the 18th year

1399
02:10:24,687 --> 02:10:26,427
Tomorrow is the solar eclipse

1400
02:10:26,729 --> 02:10:27,809
The last sacrifice

1401
02:10:29,229 --> 02:10:31,749
Marudheera, somehow stop that ritual
please

1402
02:10:33,937 --> 02:10:36,337
Otherwise mankind will be in his
clutches

1403
02:10:37,437 --> 02:10:39,135
And rot along with the dust to ashes

1404
02:10:39,145 --> 02:10:40,345
Only you can stop it

1405
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:45,720
Where is Marudheera?

1406
02:10:46,270 --> 02:10:48,430
He didn't tell me where he was going

1407
02:10:48,812 --> 02:10:50,612
Take your hand off my shoulder

1408
02:10:55,187 --> 02:10:56,302
We are caught, huh?

1409
02:10:56,312 --> 02:10:56,912
Then what?

1410
02:10:57,437 --> 02:10:58,757
I am Pei-azhagu kuruvi

1411
02:11:04,604 --> 02:11:05,684
We are just actors

1412
02:11:06,937 --> 02:11:09,469
You must ask the one who asked us to
transform like this

1413
02:11:09,479 --> 02:11:10,499
That is only fair

1414
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:00,252
You are begging bloody slaves who fall
at our feet

1415
02:12:00,937 --> 02:12:03,157
Are you trying to play games with us?

1416
02:12:45,812 --> 02:12:48,512
If you come with love we know to wag our
tails

1417
02:12:48,812 --> 02:12:50,635
If you come to fight we also know...

1418
02:12:50,645 --> 02:12:52,745
...with our swords to make you wail

1419
02:12:58,562 --> 02:13:00,542
I've understood almost ¾ of this

1420
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:03,391
Change your name Strength you will gain

1421
02:13:03,401 --> 02:13:04,481
You are Marudheera

1422
02:13:05,019 --> 02:13:06,908
When you knew you're a demon you got
your strength

1423
02:13:06,918 --> 02:13:07,847
If squashed, go and pee

1424
02:13:07,857 --> 02:13:08,937
Goes above my head

1425
02:13:12,604 --> 02:13:15,427
We got that wrong, it means take the
'single vethal hoop' test

1426
02:13:15,437 --> 02:13:16,594
I walked on fire and won

1427
02:13:16,604 --> 02:13:17,744
That's true, right?

1428
02:13:17,854 --> 02:13:20,194
Break the sceptre when the sun conceals

1429
02:13:20,562 --> 02:13:21,762
What does this mean?

1430
02:13:22,104 --> 02:13:22,824
Let us think

1431
02:13:25,437 --> 02:13:26,457
Alpha, Beta, Kama

1432
02:13:26,770 --> 02:13:28,927
You must now go to the royal altar of
sacrifice

1433
02:13:28,937 --> 02:13:29,537
Ready

1434
02:13:30,104 --> 02:13:32,564
Kodangi and Sama you should enter the
jail

1435
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:35,640
Somehow save my grandfather

1436
02:13:37,145 --> 02:13:40,985
Soora, you have to keep an eye on the
various parts of the palace

1437
02:13:43,312 --> 02:13:44,572
Certainly, Marudheera

1438
02:13:47,187 --> 02:13:49,587
Let tomorrow dawn favorably to the
people

1439
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:15,940
Marudheera has met the washerman

1440
02:14:17,479 --> 02:14:19,939
I've ripped him apart and made him
confess

1441
02:14:20,854 --> 02:14:21,934
What is the truth?

1442
02:14:22,854 --> 02:14:26,574
The assailant from Kangini Desam who has
come to destroy you...

1443
02:14:27,645 --> 02:14:29,565
...is none other than Marudheera

1444
02:14:38,937 --> 02:14:39,537
Marudheera

1445
02:14:41,770 --> 02:14:43,270
You intend destroying me?

1446
02:14:44,104 --> 02:14:45,484
You start the sacrifice

1447
02:14:48,187 --> 02:14:51,067
I will have the pleasure of destroying
Marudheera

1448
02:15:38,267 --> 02:15:40,847
You have come in search of death,
Marudheera

1449
02:15:41,950 --> 02:15:44,757
Generally everyone will run at the sight
of death

1450
02:15:44,767 --> 02:15:48,607
But Death will flee for its life when
confronted by a brave heart

1451
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,840
Won't that Cyclops also be inside?

1452
02:16:11,158 --> 02:16:13,590
I can already hear the funeral conch in
my stomach

1453
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:15,280
You don't beat the drums too

1454
02:16:57,350 --> 02:16:59,150
Don't be too happy, Marudheera

1455
02:17:00,517 --> 02:17:02,437
I am the General of this kingdom

1456
02:17:04,975 --> 02:17:05,575
General!!

1457
02:17:09,347 --> 02:17:11,567
You are the General of ONLY this land

1458
02:17:15,184 --> 02:17:17,584
I have come here to rewrite your destiny

1459
02:17:59,367 --> 02:18:00,507
Hey 'Pachai vaayan'?

1460
02:18:00,517 --> 02:18:01,357
Front or rear?

1461
02:18:01,767 --> 02:18:02,427
Front, huh?

1462
02:18:02,934 --> 02:18:03,534
Let's go

1463
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:53,100
Marudheera! Don't kill me

1464
02:19:53,142 --> 02:19:53,802
Please wait

1465
02:19:56,059 --> 02:19:58,879
Take all this wealth, riches, throne,
everything

1466
02:20:01,267 --> 02:20:01,867
Spare me

1467
02:20:03,267 --> 02:20:03,867
Let me go

1468
02:20:04,767 --> 02:20:05,547
Don't kill me

1469
02:20:06,267 --> 02:20:06,987
Listen to me

1470
02:20:11,850 --> 02:20:13,410
Think about it, Marudheera

1471
02:20:14,350 --> 02:20:15,190
Think about it

1472
02:20:23,725 --> 02:20:25,674
Only brave hearts blossom in our
motherland

1473
02:20:25,684 --> 02:20:28,024
This is no place for betrayers to bloom

1474
02:20:30,475 --> 02:20:31,315
Marudheera...!

1475
02:20:41,267 --> 02:20:43,187
If I break this mystical ring...

1476
02:20:44,767 --> 02:20:46,627
...the queen will lose her mind

1477
02:20:48,309 --> 02:20:51,729
She will erupt with a fury multiple
times more than frenzy

1478
02:20:52,934 --> 02:20:55,094
You cannot escape at all, Marudheera

1479
02:21:16,059 --> 02:21:16,659
Marudheera

1480
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:18,000
Here's our king

1481
02:21:20,725 --> 02:21:21,385
Grandfather

1482
02:22:09,684 --> 02:22:11,674
I thought he will pounce and strike us
down

1483
02:22:11,684 --> 02:22:13,632
He has spread himself flat on the ground

1484
02:22:13,642 --> 02:22:17,182
My Cyclops-eye has the power to realize
one's previous birth

1485
02:22:19,350 --> 02:22:20,910
You're my king's bloodline

1486
02:22:21,642 --> 02:22:23,202
I am his diligent defender

1487
02:22:23,850 --> 02:22:26,130
That's why they had imprisoned me also

1488
02:22:28,892 --> 02:22:30,752
What should I do for us to win?

1489
02:22:36,392 --> 02:22:39,799
Beta, I think the girl who is tied over
there is Pavalamalli

1490
02:22:39,809 --> 02:22:40,829
Let us rescue her

1491
02:22:41,017 --> 02:22:41,617
Mother!

1492
02:22:43,559 --> 02:22:44,279
Ma...stop it

1493
02:22:45,725 --> 02:22:47,285
This is your brother's son

1494
02:22:47,725 --> 02:22:48,325
Marudheera

1495
02:22:49,725 --> 02:22:52,545
Jaladharanga has cast a black magic
spell on you

1496
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:54,820
You are unaware of what you are doing

1497
02:22:55,184 --> 02:22:55,784
Marudheera

1498
02:22:56,684 --> 02:22:58,364
You can outsmart my daughter

1499
02:22:59,892 --> 02:23:01,932
But your tricks won't work with me

1500
02:23:02,767 --> 02:23:03,367
Ma...?

1501
02:23:06,475 --> 02:23:07,555
I am Yavana 'rani'

1502
02:23:09,309 --> 02:23:11,229
Queen of Yama, the Lord of death

1503
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:42,240
Don't, Your Majesty

1504
02:24:12,517 --> 02:24:13,657
Hey! Cyclops friend

1505
02:24:13,809 --> 02:24:16,340
Whomever I point to, as per Marudheera's
orders...

1506
02:24:16,350 --> 02:24:17,730
...smash them to pieces

1507
02:24:17,767 --> 02:24:19,627
Your wish is my command, friend

1508
02:24:55,642 --> 02:24:56,902
They have ambushed us

1509
02:25:03,913 --> 02:25:04,513
Kodangi

1510
02:25:05,813 --> 02:25:06,833
Our flock is here

1511
02:25:08,142 --> 02:25:09,102
Well done, Soora

1512
02:25:10,142 --> 02:25:11,762
Peck everyone and kill them

1513
02:25:19,559 --> 02:25:21,299
Lend me a hand and lift me up

1514
02:25:45,642 --> 02:25:46,542
Don't be scared

1515
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:48,257
We have been sent by Marudheera

1516
02:25:48,267 --> 02:25:48,867
Quick

1517
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:15,130
Hurry up, bro

1518
02:26:22,767 --> 02:26:23,367
Pull

1519
02:26:37,017 --> 02:26:37,617
Don't

1520
02:26:39,392 --> 02:26:39,992
Give it

1521
02:26:42,975 --> 02:26:44,475
Give it to me, Marudheera

1522
02:26:45,142 --> 02:26:47,362
Otherwise I will pierce you to pieces

1523
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:51,240
'Break the spectre when the sun is
concealed'

1524
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:56,830
When the moon eclipses the sun...

1525
02:26:58,434 --> 02:26:59,874
...break this magic wand

1526
02:27:02,267 --> 02:27:04,067
Hand it over to me, Marudheera

1527
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:05,200
Forgive me

1528
02:27:06,725 --> 02:27:08,105
If I should save you...

1529
02:27:09,267 --> 02:27:10,467
...I must break this

1530
02:27:11,059 --> 02:27:11,659
Give it

1531
02:28:21,892 --> 02:28:22,612
Hey! Kodangi

1532
02:28:26,475 --> 02:28:27,075
Soora...?

1533
02:28:27,392 --> 02:28:30,152
Your curse has been dispelled You are a
man now

1534
02:28:32,184 --> 02:28:35,604
I have to be punished for the way I have
treated my people

1535
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:38,200
Ma...?

1536
02:28:38,309 --> 02:28:39,269
Don't...leave it

1537
02:28:39,642 --> 02:28:41,382
Your spell has been dispelled

1538
02:28:41,892 --> 02:28:42,972
Mother, don't jump

1539
02:28:44,267 --> 02:28:44,867
Don't

1540
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:47,924
Hereafter you can rule for the welfare
of your subjects

1541
02:28:47,934 --> 02:28:50,757
Let the curse bestowed on my family
because of me...

1542
02:28:50,767 --> 02:28:52,507
...be destroyed along with me

1543
02:28:52,892 --> 02:28:53,552
You should-

1544
02:28:54,184 --> 02:28:55,684
Don't be impulsive...wait

1545
02:28:56,142 --> 02:28:58,422
You should all live happily ever after

1546
02:29:05,392 --> 02:29:07,972
Aunt, a grave injustice happened through
you

1547
02:29:08,809 --> 02:29:10,489
But you are not the offender

1548
02:29:12,642 --> 02:29:14,322
All of us need your blessing

1549
02:29:29,142 --> 02:29:31,962
We have decided to go back to our Aghori
islands

1550
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:37,439
My daughter Mandakini will rule our
kingdom there

1551
02:29:38,559 --> 02:29:42,132
I hand over this Vethala Desam along
with the 56 villages I ruled

1552
02:29:42,142 --> 02:29:42,982
...back to you

1553
02:29:44,475 --> 02:29:47,175
Even though Marudheera by birth is a
Vethal...

1554
02:29:48,267 --> 02:29:50,667
...we will adopt him as part of our clan

1555
02:29:51,267 --> 02:29:51,867
Certainly

1556
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:57,800
That is why I coronate Marudheera as the
rightful ruler of your kingdom

1557
02:29:59,725 --> 02:30:00,625
King Marudheera

1558
02:30:00,975 --> 02:30:01,575
Long live!

1559
02:30:02,142 --> 02:30:03,042
King Marudheera

1560
02:30:03,309 --> 02:30:03,909
Long live!

1561
02:30:14,267 --> 02:30:15,587
I am born in this soil

1562
02:30:19,642 --> 02:30:21,622
Even if I am empowered to rule...

1563
02:30:22,850 --> 02:30:24,830
...I will always be a part of you

1564
02:30:25,892 --> 02:30:28,832
The 1st voice to echo the welfare of the
people...

1565
02:30:29,725 --> 02:30:31,045
...will be mine always

1566
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:35,799
My dream is for everyone to have their
wishes fulfilled

1567
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:40,320
Only your happiness is my joy forever

1568
02:30:41,267 --> 02:30:42,167
King Marudheera

1569
02:30:42,809 --> 02:30:43,409
Long live

1570
02:30:43,892 --> 02:30:44,792
King Marudheera

1571
02:30:45,142 --> 02:30:45,742
Long live!

1572
02:30:53,975 --> 02:30:56,195
Subtitles by rekhs assisted by harini

1573
02:31:01,392 --> 02:31:02,892
How did you shrink, Sama?

1574
02:31:03,434 --> 02:31:05,632
You think we made only Sama a Villiput?

1575
02:31:05,642 --> 02:31:07,262
We shrunk his garments also

1576
02:31:07,392 --> 02:31:08,652
That is what he means

1577
02:31:10,767 --> 02:31:12,267
Total 11 seeds and 1 root

1578
02:31:13,743 --> 02:31:15,924
Beyond that, the secret should be under
wraps

1579
02:31:15,934 --> 02:31:16,654
Happy, Sama?

1580
02:31:17,709 --> 02:31:18,969
Congratulations, Sama

1581
02:31:19,401 --> 02:31:20,874
Invite us for the baby shower

1582
02:31:20,884 --> 02:31:23,104
I will come with my wife and children

1583
02:31:23,192 --> 02:31:25,412
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
