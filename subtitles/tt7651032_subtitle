1
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:14,325
Lakshmi, My dear..Where is she gone?

2
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:23,372
Dear.. It is getting dark..
Where will I go searching?

3
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,544
Dear..Dear

4
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:38,353
My dear daughter..my dar
ing..

5
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,456
My God ...
 am getting scared.

6
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,925
What should I do now?

7
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:53,666
Lakshmi ..Lakshmi Where is she?

8
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,643
Lakshmi..

9
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,720
Come home..l will show you.
What have you done?

10
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,651
Got me tensedl!

11
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,291
Can I go there without you?

12
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,826
Why did you stop?

13
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,663
Oh..Cross with me?

14
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,627
Should have thought about it
before doing it.

15
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,532
I told you about my sorrows..

16
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,236
Come..walk home..

17
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,549
Where is he lying?

18
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,645
On that hilltop. Come...
Let us go and see.

19
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,246
When did it happen?

20
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,850
Don't know.When I went out,
heard people talking

21
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,252
I didn't even go for work.
Came here straight.

22
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:27,498
Look there.Lot of people are
gathering on hearing this.

23
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,404
Just give way..

24
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:42,939
Did you recognise him?

25
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,418
Isn't it Ramabhadran? He stays in
the government's land in Pulikkunnu

26
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,249
This cow belongs to him.
It has been with him as a calf

27
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,851
That is what I was thinking too..

28
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:51,981
His face is quite familiar.

29
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,453
Who knows what happened?

30
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,522
Now look how she hurries..

31
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,828
I can't run with
you Lakshmikutty"

32
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,342
I am tired.

33
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,038
Walk..Walk

34
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:18,384
Got it .You don't have a place to go.
Is it?

35
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:24,547
But how long can I walk
with you in this forestl?

36
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,684
Run slow..dear.
Let me also reach there

37
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,031
Been walking since long!!

38
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,026
Walk..Walk..

39
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,631
Isn't it an elephant trumpeting?

40
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,800
Don't worry when I am there with you.

41
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,701
Wait..What can I do to get you some water?

42
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,842
All the streams and rivulets have dried up.

43
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,420
Walk

44
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:58,954
Thank God

45
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,387
Looks like God has been kind to us at last.

46
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,958
Didn't you understand?

47
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,896
Look there..

48
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,331
Come

49
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,833
Drink as much as you like

50
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:17,133
Come..Are you scared seeing water?

51
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,640
.Come..

52
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,572
Till now you were unhappy
that you didn't get water.

53
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,375
Now when you get water
you get mischievous!!

54
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,724
Drink..it is pure water. Drink..

55
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,429
Come here..There is a nice girl!

56
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,611
You had a stomachfull?

57
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,947
I am happy now.

58
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,512
But you didn't ask me ifl had water.

59
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,824
I was joking..Don't bother"

60
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,099
I am tired..

61
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,999
Let us rest for some time before we leave".

62
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,971
No..We have to reach some
shelter before sunset.

63
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,775
I have no idea about the geography
of this place or about the roads.

64
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,102
Can sleep later

65
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,035
Walk ahead.

66
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:31,847
The way you run, it looks like
you know this place well...!!

67
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,979
Have been walking for quite a long time.
My God ..

68
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,557
God alone knows how far
we have to walk now...!

69
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,567
You stay here. Let me go and see

70
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,267
Looks like God is helping us

71
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,651
Lakshmikutty..No one is here.

72
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,955
Shall we stay here?

73
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,622
You be here. I will get everything alright.

74
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,229
Take this..

75
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,059
Do you want this.?

76
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,830
Ou mischievous one?

77
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,284
Are you a Vagabond?

78
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,688
I have not seen you here before.
That is why

79
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,281
I don't belong to this place.

80
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:04,418
I know.

81
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,692
All of us do belong to an old
family here. I am Vijayan.

82
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,025
People call me Vijayetta.

83
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,868
Some guys call me 'towel' Vijayan also.

84
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,697
Because I have this around my head always.

85
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:24,139
Why did you both leave your place?

86
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,712
The cow didn't have enough grass and water?

87
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,908
No..we didn't have a place
of our own. That is why

88
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,246
Oh..l see

89
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,511
So you decided to stay here. ls it?

90
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:35,754
Not exactly.

91
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,414
We got so tired yesterday walking".

92
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,322
...So decided to stay here for the night.

93
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,527
Where is your house, Sir

94
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,126
I stay a little ahead from here.

95
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,263
And I don't frequent this place often

96
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,491
I am going to the town
to buy some provisions.

97
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:49,166
Oh..

98
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,271
What is your name?

99
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:52,165
Ramab had ran

100
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,908
Do you know..we don't have
water since two years.

101
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:57,838
So what happened?

102
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,412
Wild animals are leaving forests
and entering the countryside.

103
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:03,073
Better to be careful.

104
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,184
What can I say

105
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,082
I don't know who he is

106
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,249
Didn't you see him.

107
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,554
You should have asked

108
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,159
But you also saw them

109
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,195
Why should we bother?

110
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,266
There are people who are
responsible for such things.

111
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:20,923
Let them do that.

112
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:21,933
The president is coming

113
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,230
Maybe he is here after hearing about this.

114
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:23,895
What is it, Venu?

115
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:24,501
Er..Er

116
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,561
Why are you three here
in the morning itself?

117
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,240
Someone has been staying for
quite some time in the hut

118
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,175
...left by the dam laborers in the govt.
Land near Pulikkunnu

119
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,970
He does not look like
someone from around here.

120
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,514
ltoo heard about that before coming here.

121
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,306
Didn't you ask him about his whereabouts?

122
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:40,053
Those who are in authority should
ask such things. That is better.

123
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,951
It is not right to be insubordinate.

124
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,957
0k..Let me see

125
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,955
His character changed after
he got the title deed.

126
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,553
Why?

127
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,430
Finds it difficult even to smile

128
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:56,868
We politicians also don't smile often.

129
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,530
We smile well only when
election approaches.

130
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,932
Come..Go ahead

131
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,577
Look President..He has
even built a cattle shed.

132
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,342
Who knows who is he or from where is he?

133
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,575
No one in?

134
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,823
No one in?

135
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,319
From where have you come?

136
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,454
I am from Kulathupuzha

137
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:29,025
I don't care..What is your
purpose in staying here?

138
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,160
Leave this place immediately.

139
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:33,032
I am the Panchayath President.
You understand?

140
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,307
I have nowhere to stay Sir.

141
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,410
And have no relatives too

142
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,507
You have a calf too?

143
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,446
From where did you get this calf?

144
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,613
I was working as a domestic help.

145
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:47,985
When they left here to Bombay
for good, they gave me this.

146
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,886
And asked me to go and mend for myself.

147
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:54,058
So they dismissed you after
giving you just a calf. ls it?

148
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:55,656
How ungrateful!!

149
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,389
They would have given me more.

150
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,862
But their children didn't let them

151
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,500
Sir..Come here.

152
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,631
He looks like a simpleton.

153
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,676
After all this is a vacant place.

154
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,240
He won't be here forever.

155
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,074
And we can assure a vote
in the next election.

156
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,143
Let us see

157
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:25,488
If it were in my town,
he would have got bashed up ..

158
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:28,127
No...No Sir..
 will leave right now

159
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,185
The president was not talking about you.

160
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,531
He was talking about those who dismissed
you after giving you just a calf.

161
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:35,430
Do you have any complaints?
I will get it settled.

162
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:38,470
I have been working hard .Toiled hard.

163
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,231
Struggling even now..

164
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,498
I have no complaints against anyone

165
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,139
What about your parents?

166
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,207
My father was working there itself.

167
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,041
I don't remember seeing my mother.

168
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:54,113
When my father died I
started working there, sir.

169
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,087
OK..OK..This is govt. Land.

170
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,155
Stay here for the time being,
but don't try to be over smart.

171
00:15:59,293 --> 00:15:59,953
Yes

172
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,221
I will take care of everything else

173
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,390
0k Let us go

174
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:19,009
Lakshmi "Now we can stay here. Is it?

175
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:28,214
You won't get land here for
the price that you imagine.

176
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,091
I am ready

177
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,484
But I won't reduce the price.

178
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:42,525
This is not marshy land .This is solid land

179
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:46,036
Hello. Lost coverage

180
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,272
<i>Thomacha</i>

181
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,703
Why are you out in this hot sun?

182
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,705
I was in search of some laborers.

183
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,645
They are in short supply

184
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:58,143
Whoever is ready, they are
absent every other day.

185
00:16:58,252 --> 00:16:59,048
That is true

186
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:03,282
Can't even get a domestic help..
Forget about the works in the com pound.

187
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:09,358
It is in such a place that the govt is
spending crores of taxpayers' money...

188
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,761
in different employment schemes!!

189
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:12,794
That is also true

190
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:18,128
And there is no govt. To consider the
cases of nonresident Indians like us

191
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:24,167
If we were in a town we would
have got Bengalis to work.

192
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:27,170
Heard that they have started
arriving here also.

193
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,280
That is rig ht Thomacha

194
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,214
Then... what news?

195
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,784
Oh..l forgot about that

196
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,714
Someone has started staying in the
govt. Land in Pulikuunnu.

197
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:35,812
He is a stranger

198
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,020
Boss, you have been here since long.

199
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,662
I was talking about the
guy who came yesterday

200
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,096
He looks like a simpleton

201
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,398
When they arrive they all
behave like simpletons.

202
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,795
After some days you start
knowing their true colors.

203
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,272
Thomacha ..he is alone there with a calf.

204
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:58,503
Maybe right. Anyone can get in
anywhere..That is notjustice

205
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,114
Quite a bad time

206
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,545
Can't leave it like that

207
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,184
Don't run

208
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,154
Hei..Are you the guy who
stays in the govt land?

209
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:11,517
What are you doing here?

210
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,126
Yes..Sir
 am just staying there.

211
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,621
Whom did you ask for permission?

212
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,231
You didn't hear?

213
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,300
Have no other option" Sir

214
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,469
Then, we should give you an option?. ls it?

215
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,429
Whose is this calf?

216
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,539
It is mine

217
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,106
Any evidence? What if it
belongs to someone else?

218
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,804
In that case, I will leave, sir

219
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,122
How will you pull on here?

220
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,415
I can do some work

221
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:47,594
What son of work can you do?

222
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:50,355
I can do farming and alsol can carry loads

223
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:52,491
Hmm

224
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,431
0k You come home tomorrow.

225
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,229
Let me see ifl can give you some work

226
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,098
lwill come

227
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,232
You know the way to my home?

228
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,601
Way er....

229
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:02,604
When you go fonward you
will see this culvert ..

230
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,278
Then take a turn towards south.

231
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:04,606
Yes

232
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,304
You will see a big house there.

233
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:09,474
You won't see such a big
house anywhere nearby

234
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,444
Suppose you miss it, ask for
Kuwait Thomachan's house

235
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,783
Everyone knows

236
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:18,858
Or else, I will give you my phone number..

237
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:24,492
No..No It is ok ..You come there

238
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:36,542
Halleluyahudesus is all powerful"
Prayers to him

239
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:41,274
Jesus is our power.
Children..Jesus is good..

240
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:52,949
Why did the God's son accept
crucifixion two thousand years ago?

241
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,323
For you, for us and for the whole humanity.

242
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,392
So all those who are born on this earth..
Listen to me

243
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:08,364
Brother, read this..the path to heaven“
Heaven is for you.

244
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,636
I have read it twice or thrice before.

245
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:13,872
It will be hell if I don't go to work today

246
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,351
Don't get totally involved
in this physical world".

247
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:19,179
Your real world...

248
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,755
Prayers to God..You are God's darlings

249
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:28,521
Lambs...Prayers to God..0h..he left

250
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,827
You be here .
 will get water.

251
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,867
He is suitable to be the God's shepherd.

252
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,632
Prayers

253
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:39,500
Oh..My--

254
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:43,975
I just said prayers, Brother.
You have to return the prayers.

255
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,506
Prayers Brother

256
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:46,477
Rivers..

257
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,638
Not rivers but prayers.

258
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,011
I know you are new here, brother

259
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,376
How is your life here?

260
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:54,977
No problems, Sir

261
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,747
Don't call me 'Sir', Brother.

262
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,451
Everyone calls me Sneham Babychayan

263
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:01,756
Prayers

264
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:02,554
Ok

265
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,826
When you stay alone you get opportunities
to know about your guardian.

266
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,893
When you take the calf for gracing
you should think such things

267
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,768
Jesus is our saviour.

268
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:15,570
What do you know about Jesus' love?

269
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:16,336
Prayers

270
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:16,909
Rivers

271
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:19,375
Not rivers but prayers.

272
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:29,455
The way you embrace your calf,
Jesus embraces sinners.

273
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:32,856
That is how God loves.Understand?

274
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:34,954
Now we can pray for some time.

275
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:40,424
Jesus..Jesus..Prayers to Jesus.

276
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:45,639
Everyone left? Jesus is good

277
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,879
Drink..

278
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:49,216
This tea is prepared by me.
She went to her house.

279
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,723
No use even if she is here.

280
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:58,659
Dude..l struggled hard in the
desert to make such a big house.

281
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,991
No body is honest here.

282
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,099
They don't know the value of labour.

283
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:09,469
An eight hour shift means you
have to work for eight hours.

284
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:15,605
Here an eight hour shift means four
hours after tea, lunch and smoke.

285
00:25:16,216 --> 00:25:17,945
You have tea.

286
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:19,878
I didn't mean you.

287
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:22,079
You are a good worker.

288
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:24,154
There are some others

289
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,519
Demands money for any silly work..
Dirty guys

290
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,262
Look..Only those who work
hard will make it big.

291
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,920
Listen Ramabhadran

292
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,496
My Arab has lot of affection towards me.

293
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:34,726
You know why..

294
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:40,966
He could trust me with any job.That is why

295
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:49,140
What are you thinking about?
You look gloomy

296
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:53,516
Any problem has a solution

297
00:25:54,188 --> 00:25:57,317
I just thought of my calf .She is alone

298
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,319
Nothing will happen to it.

299
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,524
You bother about yourself.

300
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:05,562
I have never left her alone

301
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,634
What an affectionate animal 
over!!

302
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,927
If you are so much worried,
go and check on it fast.

303
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:17,773
Come back fast

304
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:18,878
Yes

305
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,678
The police haven't arrived yet?

306
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,075
It is only just an hour.

307
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:54,212
It takes time to reach here.

308
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:55,577
They will take their own time

309
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,878
Not only that, there is a
hanal in town today.

310
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,385
They will be busy with that.
They can reach only after that

311
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:01,951
HanaLThere was one three days ago?!

312
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,147
That was called by another party

313
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:05,018
There are three on an average every month.

314
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,719
I wonder if this cow has been fed properly.

315
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,819
Could have fed her with
some grass or water.

316
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:13,123
Isn't it too hot. How can
it say here in the hot sun?

317
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,392
Poor thing

318
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:43,756
Bro..How can I go? Will the cow hit me?

319
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:48,732
She is a poor animal. Won't do anything

320
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,636
What is this? What happened?

321
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,768
She is a poor traveler

322
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:03,114
Bro..Move fast..There is a snake

323
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:03,979
Where?

324
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,644
Look..it is crawling under the leaf

325
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:09,722
God saved us

326
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:13,121
This cow saved you.
It found the snake and warned us.

327
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:17,931
Terrific indeed

328
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:26,198
She is concerned aboutyour
affairs more than yourselfl!

329
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:30,870
She is like that. My Lakshmi.
She is always there to guard me

330
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:33,279
Who are you?

331
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:35,077
I haven't seen you before.

332
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:36,842
I have seen you.

333
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:40,487
Myself? I am a cook at
the Nilakkal bungalow.

334
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:43,758
Just got out to go to the shop..
It was then..

335
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,022
Why are you staying in the hot sun?

336
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:48,958
Won't you get tanned?

337
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:51,758
Oh...Can't bother about
such things these days

338
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:55,993
One always feels happy on
seeing affectionate people.

339
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:31,228
How long the cow has been in the hot sun?!!

340
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:31,804
True

341
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:34,135
His wife would have taken the cow with her.

342
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,040
They were pals.

343
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:40,044
What is the point. She quarreled
with him and left long time ago.

344
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:43,542
Nowadays, girls‘ behaviour is weird!!

345
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:52,826
Can't see that guy anywhere.

346
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:56,019
Where has he gone leaving this cow here?

347
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,798
Lakshmi..Where is your boss?

348
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:02,330
Not seen around. He left you alone?

349
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:07,132
See what I have brought for you.Eat

350
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:11,843
There is quite a lot.Eat it in full

351
00:30:14,615 --> 00:30:15,582
Who is there?

352
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:17,143
What is that?

353
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,548
I was giving this cow
some ripe banana skins

354
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,087
Oh..it was you?

355
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,922
There is some for you too

356
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,260
It is ripe and very good

357
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:37,298
I plucked it myself for you. Ripe mangoes

358
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,438
That is why it so tasty

359
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:43,073
What is your name?

360
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:44,401
Ramani

361
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:45,971
Nice name

362
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,011
Then. Let me leave.
Madam will scold me ifl get late

363
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,113
She is of a peculiar nature"

364
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:01,554
I plucked them only to give you

365
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:17,944
Hei..get it from the village office

366
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:20,007
Panchayath has nothing to do with it.

367
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,582
Anyway, you come to the office.
Let us see what can be done

368
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:26,576
Sir

369
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:36,890
I thought you were at home looking
after your cow and not working

370
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:39,861
I have to work .Sir.
I have to fill two bellies

371
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,634
Anyway, you do have a cow.

372
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,870
Panchayath gives some benefits
to those who have cows.

373
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:47,971
For milk farmers..if you want,
I can arrange.

374
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,438
You will get a new cow also as subsidy.

375
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,076
A new cow?!

376
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,273
The loan is ready. You just have to sign.
A loan in your name ..

377
00:31:56,417 --> 00:32:01,048
You don't have to pay back.
This is a subsidy from the govt.

378
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:03,047
You won't have any liabilities on this.

379
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:07,456
Just signed for a loan. That is all.

380
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:09,488
I feel sorry watching you, struggling.
That is why.

381
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,054
lwill be back

382
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:30,313
What?

383
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:32,452
Here ..

384
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:35,281
When I have you with me why
do I need another cow?

385
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:39,253
I don't need another cow or bull

386
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:42,093
Eat it..
 will get water.

387
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,547
What happened?

388
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:18,295
They asked me not to come for work any more

389
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:19,524
Why?

390
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:23,093
I don't know. They didn't tell me

391
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:26,369
When I went for work today
they said I am sacked.

392
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:31,101
I have nowhere to go

393
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:42,020
Do you mind staying here?

394
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:42,520
What?

395
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,592
I have only this much...

396
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,667
I will look after you well

397
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:27,758
We do jell well. Understand?

398
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:34,437
Ramabhadran and Remani...even the names jell

399
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,370
Speak softly. Someone might overhear

400
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:39,837
Who is there to overhear?

401
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,272
Lakshmi is there

402
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:42,813
She won't understand a thing

403
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:45,810
You don't know that.

404
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:48,450
She understands everything about me.

405
00:34:50,557 --> 00:34:52,047
<i>SW?</i>

406
00:34:52,326 --> 00:34:55,352
This is the first time a man touches me

407
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,393
What?

408
00:34:57,631 --> 00:34:59,497
You don't believe that?

409
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:19,413
Ramani

410
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:25,524
Ramani, get up. Don't you hear her crying?

411
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:26,853
who?

412
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,856
Lakshmi.. Get up

413
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:33,696
Oh..My

414
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:46,545
I am just coming .Got a bit late today.

415
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:54,843
Lakshmi kutty..pardon me

416
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:57,483
What? What happened?

417
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:00,288
Do you recognize her?

418
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:04,426
You saw her yesterday too.

419
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,191
From now on, she will be here always.

420
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,463
She will look after you well

421
00:36:11,372 --> 00:36:15,172
Look ..She licks you.
It seems she likes you well.

422
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:16,603
She is a kind son.

423
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,371
Like me

424
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,945
You won't get such an affectionate
cow anywhere in the world

425
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,547
True

426
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:25,776
Even I do feel like that

427
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:29,553
But don't be over smarﬂ!

428
00:36:29,623 --> 00:36:33,856
Panchyath president told me he would give me
a loan to purchase another one like this.

429
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:36,586
That is good

430
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:40,531
I said no. Why should I have
another one when she is here

431
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,965
No..But when they make an offer

432
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:47,604
Whatever is the offer when my Lakshmi
is here why do I need another one?

433
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:49,402
No other cow will be like this one

434
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,172
She is listening..Look

435
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:53,638
She must have understood

436
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:56,910
Definite
y..They are more intelligent
than us..but can't speak.That is all

437
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:00,377
They give loans to everyone
from panchayath?....?

438
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,247
Who knows? Maybe they do!!

439
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:07,384
Rametta..Tomorrow we should
go to the temple festival

440
00:37:08,962 --> 00:37:10,191
Er....That..

441
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:14,264
Let us go Rametta This is the first
festival after we got together

442
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,643
Why are you roaming around here?
Not going for work?

443
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:26,503
She is not going for wok any more

444
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,442
I married her.

445
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:31,312
Come Rametta..Let us cut the grass..
Then we will go for work

446
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:36,413
The new bride shows off..
She will show off more!!

447
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:39,718
Look at the o
die's character!!

448
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:44,564
Take this

449
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:46,331
Eat this

450
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:50,597
However busy is he, he takes
care of these goats so welll!

451
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:58,506
I like people who work sincerely.

452
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:01,880
That is the culture in the Gulf.
Didn't I tell you?

453
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:05,045
Will your wife stay there alone?

454
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,614
Isn't she new to this place?

455
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:09,686
Has she become familiar to this place?

456
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:11,616
She belongs to this place, sir.

457
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:13,784
She was working in Nilakkal house

458
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:15,556
Then, the place must be familiar to her.

459
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:18,892
When Lakshmi is there as a com panion,.
No worries

460
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,028
For you, the cow is more im portanfl!

461
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,701
That is true. Animals are grateful beings.

462
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:28,270
Human beings are an ungrateful lot.

463
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:33,035
Whenl used to come from the Gulf
I used to help everyone here

464
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,081
And no one is grateful"

465
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:39,713
Nowl don't get even one
of them in an emergency

466
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:43,652
And I don't go begging to these guys

467
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,389
That is my policy

468
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:48,627
I do whatever has to be
done at the proper time.

469
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:50,764
That is the secret of my success

470
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:55,762
Do you knowl earned all this by myself.

471
00:38:57,638 --> 00:39:02,599
Then..if your wife gets bored
at home take her also for work

472
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:05,002
She won't get bored here

473
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:06,709
And you have a company too

474
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:08,848
I was about to ask you

475
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:09,848
Where is sister gone?

476
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,315
Went to her house

477
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,817
It is good to have a company

478
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,357
Let me call her

479
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:21,886
Hello

480
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:32,002
What is this?

481
00:39:32,172 --> 00:39:34,732
I applied some turmeric.

482
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:37,442
Don't we have to go for the festival today?

483
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:41,106
Not only that, turmeric kills germs

484
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:42,674
We will attain purity

485
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,715
It is good for chaste women to take
bath in turmeric water sometimes

486
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:50,112
Women in Tamil Nadu are like that.

487
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:52,084
Chandrettan used to say

488
00:39:52,426 --> 00:39:54,861
Who is Chandrettan?

489
00:39:55,029 --> 00:40:00,866
He is my distant cousin..
No..No.. he is my brother

490
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:06,498
Forget that..Please apply
this oil on my palms.

491
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:08,375
I have an ache

492
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:12,506
Maybe since I lied on this side yesterday

493
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:18,541
Please do that ..
 have severe pain

494
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,014
Come inside. Someone will see

495
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:28,991
There is no one to see here

496
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,196
Even if someone sees applying oil
on palms, what is wrong with that?

497
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:34,896
Lakshmi is listening

498
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:38,104
So what? lsnt it an animal?

499
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:41,804
You don't know that.
She is like a daughter for me.

500
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:44,035
I had only her till now.

501
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:52,710
Leave it..Why don't you get her mated?

502
00:40:54,254 --> 00:40:57,986
You will get a calf and also enough
milk to meet the expenditure.

503
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:03,154
No. I don't like to squeeze
her to make milk and money

504
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:09,426
Not only that .She also would be havingm.
Some desires?!

505
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:21,038
How powerful are you!!
I got to knowthat yesterday.

506
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:27,521
I will cook horse gram
curry for you tonight

507
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,732
It doesn't look like a festival.
Can't see many people

508
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,828
This is not such a large fest.

509
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:43,062
But by evening some crowd will gather.

510
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:50,175
My Godess..Protect us..

511
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:00,178
Come

512
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:11,754
Snake Lords..Protect us.

513
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,560
Swamy

514
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:15,160
One pushpanjali

515
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:16,603
Date of birth and the asterism?

516
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,864
Ramabhadran Ayi

yam..isn't it?

517
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:21,036
Ramani..Moo
am

518
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:23,869
You can have a walk around.
It will take ten minutes.

519
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,251
Let us go

520
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:50,668
What do you want, sis?

521
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:54,697
These are hair clips. Good ones..new models

522
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,011
Come

523
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,083
This looks good. How much for this?

524
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:10,086
A good bell. Only 250 bucks

525
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:12,121
That is a bit on the higher side.

526
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:13,351
I want to tie it around my cow's neck.

527
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:14,793
Then, you should have told me.

528
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:15,827
There are others as well.

529
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:18,024
This costs only a hundred

530
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,158
Even that is too much

531
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:23,065
Then, have it for 80

532
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:28,865
What a heat!!!

533
00:43:29,176 --> 00:43:30,905
Last year it didn't rain at all

534
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:32,307
Yes..Yes

535
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:34,145
Come

536
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:35,008
Come

537
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:37,050
Velayudhan and friends are not seen.

538
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:38,741
Where are they gone?

539
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:40,911

<i>Ramabhadra".</i>

You were here?

545
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:00,234
How long have I been seeking you?

546
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:02,205
I went for work.

547
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:05,108
Today, since it is the festival
I took her to the temple.

548
00:44:05,713 --> 00:44:06,680
Ramani

549
00:44:06,747 --> 00:44:08,738
Come

550
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:12,778
Who is this new person?

551
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:16,815
Were you not the girl who
used to work in Nilakkal?

552
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:18,288
Yes

553
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:19,659
Why are you here?

554
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:21,258
I wedded her

555
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:23,386
When did that happen?

556
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:24,829
Er..

557
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:30,930
I have seen you in the market many times

558
00:44:33,273 --> 00:44:35,207
Try to live decently

559
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:42,072
Let us go to temple to get the offerings

560
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:50,882
I bought one from the market.
I just love these

561
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:52,425
I likejackfruits too

562
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:55,821
Where are you going with this?

563
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,963
Whatever I get, before eating that,
I give her a share.

564
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,033
That is my habit.isn't it Dear?

565
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:10,332
Eat it..Hold her..Take it

566
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:13,375
This is from a wild jackfruit tree.

567
00:45:13,514 --> 00:45:16,381
I have not eaten such a tasty one before

568
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:17,946
Me too.

569
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,850
I have some good and tasty food for the
first time, only after coming here.

570
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:28,287
I never imagined that we can stay
like this or even I would marry you.

571
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:31,760
I was working as a slave.

572
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:35,293
Can't even imagine I did
that, when I look back now.

573
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:41,033
Look She likes jackfruit

574
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,504
She is asking for more

575
00:45:46,347 --> 00:45:48,509
Have it enough.

576
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,152
lam living for both of you now

577
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:00,220
Get me my shirt.

578
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:01,954
I will go to Thomachan's
house and will be back soon.

579
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:02,289
Yes

580
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:05,455
Thomachan's wife gives me a
share of whatever she cooks.

581
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:06,991
She is very innocent

582
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:41,157
Feed her well

583
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:45,128
0k?

584
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,943

585
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:11,789
Sister..sister

586
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:16,301
Rama.. Were you asked
to come for work today?

587
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:17,871
I haven't come for work, Sister.

588
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:22,398
ls ripe jackfruit?

589
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:24,033
Very sweet one

590
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:26,009
So you remember what I told you that day?

591
00:47:26,614 --> 00:47:27,479
Where is sir?

592
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:29,976
He went out for roaming around.

593
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:31,876
Now he will come back late.

594
00:47:32,553 --> 00:47:34,180
He doesn't think he is getting old.

595
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:38,523
If our children were here
they would have advised him

596
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,456
This is my destiny..What to do?

597
00:47:40,594 --> 00:47:41,356
What happened?

598
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:43,488
It is better not to talk about all that.

599
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,591

f
 start talking there will be a lot.

600
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,430
Can I take a cup of tea for you?

601
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:50,367
No... I am leaving. Lot of work to do.

602
00:47:50,537 --> 00:47:51,834
Ok

603
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:00,477
Have it

604
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:10,613
Look... how pathetic...Raman's body!!

605
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:14,459
Nobody thought that he
would have such a fate.

606
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:16,530
That is how man's destiny plays

607
00:48:17,498 --> 00:48:19,865
It will be good if
everyone learns from this

608
00:48:21,302 --> 00:48:23,669
We all have to leave once.

609
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,438
One should always remember that.

610
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:28,033
Then, one wouldn't start
finding fault with others.

611
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:29,471
We will start loving each other

612
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,065
<i>RamamRamani</i>

613
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:26,360
Where did she go locking the door?

614
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:35,373
Where did she go without feeding Lakshmi

615
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:44,480
Eat it dear..

616
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,957
Didn't you also see?

617
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:56,461
I will bring your food

618
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:25,584
Drink..Drink

619
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:24,895
Where have you been?

620
00:53:25,005 --> 00:53:25,528
I went to the market

621
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:26,505
For what?

622
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:27,233
To buy cattlefeed.

623
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:28,239
And you took so much time for that?!

624
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:31,173
Sneham Baychayan was preaching there.

625
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:32,345
Listened to that.

626
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:33,413

didn't ask you to go

627
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,470
Why should you tell me?

628
00:53:34,615 --> 00:53:35,912
When it got overl went and purchased it.

629
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:36,973
Why do you bother so much?

630
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:39,811
This the third of fourth time you have
been doing this without telling me

631
00:53:39,954 --> 00:53:41,820
Didn't I tell you not to
go without informing me

632
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,823
ls it a sin..Buying cattle feed?

633
00:53:43,924 --> 00:53:47,360
Buying cattle feed!!
Don't think that others are fools.

634
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:48,552
Then you believe that.

635
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:49,527
How dare you“

636
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,654
Being arroganﬂ!

637
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:38,635
Whatever happened is over.

638
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,748
Now don't brood over that.

639
00:54:40,848 --> 00:54:43,010
Feed Lakshmi

640
00:55:00,434 --> 00:55:02,596
Lakshmi dear ...Don't get cross with me.

641
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:08,274
Yesterday you starved .....and me too

642
00:55:10,511 --> 00:55:11,910
Prayers

643
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:18,446
Brother..Prayers..Jesus..Prayers.
Where is the sister?

644
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:19,383
Why?

645
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:23,923
Some people listen with ears and
some others know through the heart.

646
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:28,952
The sister can read.
These are books I brought for her to read.

647
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:31,889
Children..we should be fill
ourselves up with love for God

648
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:33,923
God doesn't get angry,

649
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:35,024
He doesn't curse.

650
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,736
He doesn't think unpleasant things.

651
00:55:38,038 --> 00:55:39,563
Where is the sister?

652
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:47,110
Sister ..Where are you? Come out

653
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:47,847
No..

654
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:48,743
Sister

655
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:49,974
Brother Brother

656
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,714
Give me that. I will give her.

657
00:55:51,952 --> 00:55:52,510
Still...

658
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:53,950
It is ok. I will give

659

I have to conduct more prayer meetings.

661
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:05,095
Let me try calling.
There is no coverage here. Hello..Sister

662
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:11,963
Jesus the good one..Prayers to the Lord

663
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:43,431
First, you started cutting down the trees.
I didn't mind that

664
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:46,897
Then you started brewing illicit liquor.
Still I didn't mind.

665
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:49,372
I got suspeneded.

666
00:56:49,843 --> 00:56:54,906
Now you started growing ganja in
deep forest. I know everything.

667
00:56:55,883 --> 00:56:57,510
What are you talking about Sir?

668
00:56:57,618 --> 00:56:58,915
What did I do?

669
00:56:59,019 --> 00:56:59,815
Oh..What an innocent human being!!

670
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:01,082
You should help..

671
00:57:02,056 --> 00:57:04,855
Can't live decently despite all this

672
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:06,619
Have some groundnuts

673
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,818
No

674
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:11,589
I know that you made millions of
rupees worth assets in the city.

675
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,966
What did you do with all the money?

676
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:17,571
You don't understand our problems.

677
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:20,837
My son wants a new model Audi car.
He was so obstinate.

678
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:25,403
Now the younger one wants
to join for medicine.

679
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:27,478
I spent a crore and a half for that.

680
00:57:28,048 --> 00:57:29,846
I have to earn for all this Sir

681
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:34,615
You get free timber from forest.

682
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:37,482
And then you spend money on your
children for them to make money“.

683
00:57:37,591 --> 00:57:40,458
...To ruin people's health!!

684
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:46,627

687
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:51,899
Sir..Some movement in the jungle

688
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:53,104
As if someone is coming here.

689
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:53,799
Who is there?

690
00:57:53,907 --> 00:57:57,571

Can't go for work today

696
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:20,191

That is not right.
These guys will destroy the forest.

701
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:39,179
Who gave you permission
to enter this forest?

702
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:40,281

00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:48,057
Stop..Why do you roam around in the forest?

708
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:50,258
Does this forest belong to your dad?

01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:37,263
I am feeling very depressed.

724
01:00:38,706 --> 01:00:41,903
Didn't I feed you before I left?

725
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:43,271
Isn't it?

726
01:00:43,677 --> 01:00:45,008
Don't be cross

727
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:58,655
Yes.Tonight I will cook horse
gram curry for your dinner

728
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:30,089
Still...Where is she gone?

729
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:42,263
I am going to the market.

730
01:01:43,137 --> 01:01:46,266
Don't drink this now.
You had your feed in the morning

731
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:48,805
This is for later..

732
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,269
There is no one here to give you food.

733
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:17,755
The girl who came roaming
left roaming. Ls it?

734
01:03:53,867 --> 01:04:01,867
Lakshmi dear.. She is gone. She left us.

735
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:05,874
I shouldn't have done all these.isn't it?

736
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:10,373
Thomacha Where are you going in
a hurry early in the morning?

737
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:13,639
lam searching for Raman

738
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:15,416
He hasn't been coming for
work since some days.

739
01:05:15,516 --> 01:05:16,483
No news

740
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:18,677
So you didn't know anything?

741
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:19,452
What?

742
01:05:19,553 --> 01:05:24,320
His girl has been missing since some days.
Heard she has eloped.

743
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:26,985
And there are many
suspicious names coming up

744
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,893
Whose? I too heard about that.

745
01:05:30,297 --> 01:05:32,527
I felt like that even when I
met her for the first time

746
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:33,395
What did you feel?

747
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:34,662
Not what you intend

748
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:36,264
Why do you hesitate.

749
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,063
Anyone can see her lose morals
on the first sight itself

750
01:05:38,238 --> 01:05:40,002
Then why didn't you say that
in the beginning itself

751
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,939
Why should I talk unnecessary things?

752
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:42,601
Then why do you say that now?

753
01:05:42,743 --> 01:05:44,609
0k I am taking back my words.

754
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:46,413
Can't even joke with this old man.

755
01:05:47,047 --> 01:05:48,947
You be here .
 will go and check

756
01:05:49,049 --> 01:05:49,607
About her?

757
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:52,209
No..Raman

758
01:05:52,953 --> 01:05:56,583
Why is he so much interested in this?

759
01:05:57,591 --> 01:06:00,060
Anyway, you walk ahead

760
01:06:04,698 --> 01:06:08,191
Be cool. Rama..We will find a way out

761
01:06:10,037 --> 01:06:12,335
I never thought that she
would do such a thing.

762
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,935
I took care of her of well

763
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:17,567
And I never wanted anything in return

764
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:23,310
I made a mistake calling her
home whenl saw her crying.

765
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:24,417
Tell me Sir

766
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:28,117
What would have happened
if she did this later.

767
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:34,090
Now you are saved since you
know her character now.

768
01:06:35,629 --> 01:06:38,360
Do you know what sort of
experiences I have gone through?

769
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:43,692
Women should never be trusted upon

770
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:48,532
Still, she left without telling me a word

771
01:06:48,742 --> 01:06:51,734
Forget about it..instead of this
one, you can get nine of them.

772
01:06:52,813 --> 01:06:54,679
I will look after your case.

773
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:57,781
Don't be crying like this. Come home

774
01:06:58,052 --> 01:06:59,747
Let us finish the work in our com pound

775
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,112
I will come.

776
01:07:01,488 --> 01:07:01,784
Ok

777
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:03,386
Make it today or tomorrow

778
01:07:14,134 --> 01:07:16,398
Why do you brood like this?

779
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,060
Whatever has happened has happened.

780
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:20,238
If you get sick out of brooding too much....

781
01:07:20,674 --> 01:07:22,472
...Know that you are alone

782
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:26,702
See that you don't get into more troubles

783
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:33,412
She has left and has not
returned since so many days.

784
01:07:33,721 --> 01:07:36,088
That is whatl said..Are you listening?

785
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:38,789
What are you talking about, President?

786
01:07:40,861 --> 01:07:45,264
You give a police
complaint" that she is missing

787
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:46,766
What use?

788
01:07:46,867 --> 01:07:50,303
If anything happens toher..
You should not be blamed.

789
01:07:52,806 --> 01:07:55,673
Are you sure she won't come back?

790
01:07:57,177 --> 01:07:58,645
Maybe she will come back

791
01:07:58,812 --> 01:07:59,574
But how?

792
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:05,852
She went to see her mother.
Her mother was seriously ill

793
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:15,227
I told you whatl should tell you.
Now it is up to you to decide.

794
01:08:15,696 --> 01:08:18,563
Don't hang around here brooding.
Go and do some work.

795
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:35,276
<i>Rama. Rama</i>

796
01:08:37,918 --> 01:08:40,387
We have to strengthen the
goat shed today itself

797
01:08:40,654 --> 01:08:41,416
Why? Sir

798
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:42,649
Didn't you know?

799
01:08:42,756 --> 01:08:43,222
No

800
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,689
There is a tiger on prowl around here

801
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:51,228
Heard that it grabbed a buffalo, a goat
and seven to eight other animals.

802
01:08:51,632 --> 01:08:54,226
Who knows which house it will enter now?

803
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:55,902
But I didn't know this

804
01:08:56,203 --> 01:08:56,726
How will you knowl!

805
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:59,498
You were not on terra firma
after your problems..

806
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:07,107
Rama..Got any news about your wife?

807
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:11,808
What is there to know? Can't trust anyone

808
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:13,351
That is true

809
01:09:14,688 --> 01:09:18,352
How can you stay in such a place
alone that too with a cow?

810
01:09:18,592 --> 01:09:22,688
I am worried if you have to
get out in an emergency.

811
01:09:22,796 --> 01:09:25,163
For everyone, it is good
to have a bit of fear.

812
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,824
lam thinking of slaughtering this goat.

813
01:09:28,635 --> 01:09:30,729
Can you do that?

814
01:09:33,474 --> 01:09:37,934
It is better to cook it and eat it
than getting grabbed by the tiger

815
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:41,376
Tell me..Can you?

816
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:43,877
So you reared it for killing it? Sir?

817
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:46,510
Ramabhadran.. Don't forget about
strengthening the goat shed

818
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:47,815
I will do that tomorrow

819
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:49,754
I have to go early today

820
01:09:49,857 --> 01:09:54,419
That is Ok.
If the tiger comes today... let it!

821
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:05,166
Brother, Where is Nilamel house?

822
01:10:05,306 --> 01:10:07,274
There is n o house in that name here.

823
01:10:07,808 --> 01:10:09,537
lam born and brought up here.

824
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,710
Where are you from?

825
01:10:12,246 --> 01:10:13,441
I am from nearby

826
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:20,254
Come here

827
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:22,482
Did you mean Nilakkal house?

828
01:10:22,656 --> 01:10:23,179
Yes

829
01:10:23,257 --> 01:10:24,383
Tell properly.

830
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:27,923
The first big house on the
left as you turn that bend

831
01:10:27,995 --> 01:10:28,962
Ok

832
01:10:30,731 --> 01:10:34,690
(Nilakkal)

833
01:10:39,306 --> 01:10:40,865
There solutions for any problem ns.

834
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:43,635
We will see that after a couple of days

835
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:48,447
Someone has come at the gate.

836
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:49,807
I will call you back

837
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:54,020
Who is this? What do you want?

838
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:56,822
ls there some one called
Ramani working here?

839
01:10:57,057 --> 01:10:59,458
She was working here.
But not any more,.She left.

840
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:01,352
Not left. Sacked.

841
01:11:01,662 --> 01:11:06,031
But why are you here.
Are you related to her?

842
01:11:07,268 --> 01:11:08,793
Myself"

843
01:11:19,613 --> 01:11:24,016
Looks like a simpleton.
She must have cheated him

844
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:29,422
Come

845
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,818
Ramabhadara "What news?

846
01:11:35,429 --> 01:11:37,397
I thought he would have
gone enquiring about her

847
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:38,761
If he has gone would he be here still?

848
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:40,924
It doesn't need much tine to go and return

849
01:11:41,102 --> 01:11:44,072
It happens with everyone.

850
01:11:44,505 --> 01:11:47,031
Can we plan anything about the future?

851
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:49,002
Leave her..

852
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:51,870
When you have this cow with you why
do you need another companion?

853
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:55,612
Yes..
 have her..
 don't need anyone else

854
01:11:56,116 --> 01:11:57,811
And I need noone's help also

855
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:02,417
Come

856
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:04,881
Walk.. Fast

857
01:12:07,895 --> 01:12:09,727
Where are you to?

858
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:10,730
Not coming there?

859
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:12,292
What is happening there?

860
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,434
So, you didn't know?

861
01:12:14,602 --> 01:12:15,967
Some problems at the President's house.

862
01:12:16,103 --> 01:12:18,629
Someone has cut a buffalo's head
and left it pierced on an iron rod

863
01:12:18,806 --> 01:12:20,467
We are going there

864
01:12:20,741 --> 01:12:23,540
Ramabhadra..Take care of your cow

865
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:25,773
They will come. Let us go

866
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:26,642
We should know what happened

867
01:12:26,747 --> 01:12:27,612
Let us go

868
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,672
Come walk

869
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:32,742
I was going to the society office

870
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:41,891
What the hell is happening in this wor
d!!

871
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,064
Very bad..

872
01:12:44,398 --> 01:12:45,365
Look..What are we seeing!!

873
01:12:45,566 --> 01:12:48,399
Since the head is here, I think the remaining
part of the torso will be somewhere around

874
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:50,997
But How did this happen?

875
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:53,472
Looks like it's both eyes are pierced out

876
01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:56,701
Come here

877
01:12:57,511 --> 01:13:00,105
Take some snaps from this side.
Let it be close ups

878
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:02,908
Who are these? Police?

879
01:13:03,584 --> 01:13:05,382
No..He is the new forest ranger

880
01:13:05,986 --> 01:13:08,353
Police has been informed.
May be they will come soon

881
01:13:08,622 --> 01:13:10,818
But.. I can't believe this

882
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:14,889
The end of the world may begin like this.

883
01:13:14,995 --> 01:13:17,089
You can see things that are not to be seen
and can hear things that can't be heard.

884
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:18,832
I am getting scared. I am leaving

885
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:21,095
You have to be scared.
We are all getting old.

886
01:13:21,402 --> 01:13:22,767
How long we will live.

887
01:13:22,836 --> 01:13:24,964
You youngsters have to be scared.

888
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:27,040
Where is the president?
Did anything happen to him?

889
01:13:27,174 --> 01:13:29,506
Where is he? Can't see him

890
01:13:29,743 --> 01:13:31,370
Be careful Sir

891
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:34,141
Here he is coming. Let us go there

892
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:35,906
Let us go and see

893
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:38,982
Truly speaking the
president is quite tired.

894
01:13:40,054 --> 01:13:41,886
How are you now? Relieved?

895
01:13:42,022 --> 01:13:42,454
Yes

896
01:13:42,523 --> 01:13:43,922
Then tell us. What happened?

897
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:48,551
As I woke up in the morning,
what I saw was the head of this buffalo..

898
01:13:48,729 --> 01:13:49,958
That too pierced on an iron rod

899
01:13:50,064 --> 01:13:52,396
Was terribly shocked to see that

900
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,795
He is trembling even now

901
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:55,424
Did you hear any sound at night?

902
01:13:55,603 --> 01:13:58,800
Nothing in particular.
lam sure it is the tiger

903
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:01,840
Can't be sure. The buffalo's head was
pierced on the iron rod..isn't it?

904
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:04,536
May be it got stuck there when
the tiger was carrying it.

905
01:14:04,678 --> 01:14:06,146
The president itself is
in such dire straits.

906
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:08,511
Then what would be the villagers' plight!!?

907
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:09,515
That is right.

908
01:14:09,717 --> 01:14:12,414
Today it came here.
Tomorrow it might come to our place

909
01:14:12,887 --> 01:14:15,686
We are not trying to leave it.
There will be actions from our side.

910
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:17,955
Still, you villagers have to be careful

911
01:14:18,459 --> 01:14:19,654
How can we be more careful

912
01:14:19,727 --> 01:14:21,126
Don't you have guns to kill it?

913
01:14:21,262 --> 01:14:22,661
Can't do it like that

914
01:14:22,897 --> 01:14:26,959
If we confirm that it is a tiger, then
we have to inform the head office first.

915
01:14:27,668 --> 01:14:31,161
The orders have to come from there.
We will do the necessary things

916
01:14:31,272 --> 01:14:32,034
Ok

917
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:33,607
Ok..Then let us leave

918
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:35,206
That was foolish of me.

919
01:14:35,543 --> 01:14:38,069
Someone was ready to buy
it for 45,000 bucks.

920
01:14:38,512 --> 01:14:40,503
Didn't give. And, now
the tiger took it off..

921
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:45,213
How long we will have to
wait for the policemen?

922
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:47,552
That is right

923
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:48,553
Anyhow..on
y this much happened.

924
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:49,919
What are you talking about?

925
01:14:50,091 --> 01:14:53,186
In was thinking how the tiger
could pierce it so we

!!

926
01:14:53,527 --> 01:14:57,760
We have to start it from the scratch now.

927
01:14:58,065 --> 01:15:01,035
The remains of the buffalo
would be lying somewhere

928
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,885
Look..There is the house

929
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:26,288
Come

930
01:15:31,766 --> 01:15:34,064
May that is the one we intended

931
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:36,069
Let us go and see

932
01:15:45,913 --> 01:15:48,644
Not as we thought.This is a valuable asset.

933
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:50,547
If he agrees, pay him immediately

934
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:51,846
Can we take it in the jeep?

935
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:54,819
Doesn't matter.
We will come with a bigger vehicle

936
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:57,283
If we delay it...

937
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,228
Isn't it Ram ettan?

938
01:16:01,829 --> 01:16:02,557
Yes

939
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:06,223
We just pulled up when
we were going this way.

940
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,696
We were talking about this poor animal

941
01:16:12,139 --> 01:16:13,163
How many animals have
been killed by the tiger.

942
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,266
It doesn't bother if it
is a goat, cow or pig

943
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,909
It is better to sell it off
for whatever price you get.

944
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,983
To tell you frankly, we liked the animal.

945
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:29,114
For a wedding.
Will pay you in cash now itself

946
01:16:30,057 --> 01:16:32,651
It is not wise to have the cow here
under the present circumstances.

947
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,660
Why should you give it
to the tiger for free

948
01:16:34,795 --> 01:16:36,126
Tell us the price. We will buy.

949
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:37,788
There is no tiger here.

950
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:39,892
What nonsense are you talking?

951
01:16:40,101 --> 01:16:42,297
Even in the president's house
it made a lot of trouble.

952
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:45,262
lam not selling this cow.
This is the only onel have

953
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:46,703
That is what we are also asking.

954
01:16:47,207 --> 01:16:50,973
Why do you want to throw
it into the jungle?

955
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:53,276
If you have come for this..No

956
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:54,944
She is my soul

957
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:57,685
What are you talking.

958
01:16:58,052 --> 01:16:59,679
How long can you live here
with a tiger on the prowl

959
01:17:01,155 --> 01:17:03,920
Think about it, brother.it is getting late

960
01:17:04,058 --> 01:17:05,389
We will make a move

961
01:17:05,659 --> 01:17:06,990
Walk ahead

962
01:17:08,262 --> 01:17:09,058
See you dear

963
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,292
What you said is right.
She is worth a million

964
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:14,367
Can't leave it like that.
We have to get it by hook or crook

965
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:16,103
Yes..And we have to do it fast

966
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:32,911
See... someone is going

967
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,215
Someone with head covered.

968
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:35,618
Catch him..Stop there

969
01:17:35,723 --> 01:17:36,713
Don't leave him

970
01:17:36,824 --> 01:17:38,258
I said stop

971
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:41,021
Remove the covering cloth

972
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:45,926
What are you doing here at this time?

973
01:17:46,133 --> 01:17:48,431
I was in an emergency..

974
01:17:48,769 --> 01:17:51,329
Be careful at night

975
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:58,374
The tiger eats not only goats and
cows but it can eat men also

976
01:18:01,415 --> 01:18:03,884
But still..what does he need at night?

977
01:18:03,984 --> 01:18:06,043
May be he has his own reasons..
You walk ahead

978
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:07,984
He wants to know his urgency..

979
01:18:08,089 --> 01:18:08,988
Walk ahead

980
01:18:10,825 --> 01:18:12,350
Where is the tiger hiding?

981
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:14,451
If it sees you sitting like this
it will immediately jump on you

982
01:18:15,763 --> 01:18:16,855
<i>SW?</i>

983
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:19,762
Ramabhadra..is the cow ok?

984
01:18:19,934 --> 01:18:20,730
She is ok

985
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:23,202
Ramabhad ra.. Atiger is on the prowl.
Be careful

986
01:18:23,471 --> 01:18:25,997
When you wait for the tiger, the
girl who has gone might come back.

987
01:18:26,106 --> 01:18:29,667
Ramabhadra.. If you hear any
sound hit the drum loudly

988
01:18:29,743 --> 01:18:30,005
Yes

989
01:18:30,077 --> 01:18:32,011
Be very careful when you get out.

990
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:35,178
Let us and go and search in that
eastern side. Come everyone

991
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:39,418
He won't sleep tonight.
Will look at the cow the whole night.

992
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:47,722
You got scared? I was not asleep

993
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:51,396
When I am here no tiger will touch you.

994
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:56,495
You didn't have enough feed today" ls it?

995
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:59,805
I will buy it tomorrow from the market.

996
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:02,333
You sleep.. Dear

997
01:19:06,947 --> 01:19:09,143
Didn't we see that while were coming?

998
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:11,409
Not a drop of water even in the rivulet

999
01:19:11,552 --> 01:19:13,486
The drought is more severe in
the forest than in the plains

1000
01:19:13,988 --> 01:19:16,252
When wild animals don't get water
they migrate to the countryside.

1001
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:20,761
But we have to do some actions
to pacify the people.

1002
01:19:21,295 --> 01:19:23,354
Things are not as we think

1003
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:25,465
That is what I too want to say.

1004
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,461
Lot of people lost their reared animals.

1005
01:19:27,902 --> 01:19:33,068
The dept. Should have taken action earlier
itself with the cooperation of the public.

1006
01:19:33,207 --> 01:19:36,177
Oh..That Er..Just a sec.

1007
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:39,869
Manmathan sir..We are waiting here.

1008
01:19:40,814 --> 01:19:42,043
It is time for him to come. It is there

1009
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:46,943
Some villagers are just arriving

1010
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:48,784
0k sir

1011
01:19:52,226 --> 01:19:54,160
You should come tomorrow
also and buy jiggery.

1012
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:56,888
Take your cattle feed and
the other provisions

1013
01:19:58,432 --> 01:20:00,867
Today's Kera
a.. [Lottery publicity]

1014
01:20:01,836 --> 01:20:06,296
I have been buying you since so many years.
Shall I win this one?

1015
01:20:06,507 --> 01:20:07,474
Sure Sir

1016
01:20:08,575 --> 01:20:09,406
Don't you want?

1017
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:10,773
I don't buy lotteries

1018
01:20:14,482 --> 01:20:17,110
What is the problem.
There are forest depot officials".

1019
01:20:17,284 --> 01:20:18,376
They are waiting for the
panchayath president.

1020
01:20:18,486 --> 01:20:19,453
To fix the location.
Usually he comes on time.

1021
01:20:19,854 --> 01:20:21,822
Don't know what happened

1022
01:20:21,956 --> 01:20:22,479
For what?

1023
01:20:22,623 --> 01:20:24,057
Going to fix a trap in the forest.

1024
01:20:24,191 --> 01:20:25,488
That would be the end of the tiger.

1025
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:29,160
The forest dept is actually working
hard to help the villagers.

1026
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:31,457
Take your balance cash.

1027
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:33,898
Where is the trap being set?

1028
01:20:34,034 --> 01:20:36,025
They came for deciding on that

1029
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,533
ls there a tiger really?

1030
01:20:37,871 --> 01:20:38,861
What sort of a person are you?

1031
01:20:39,073 --> 01:20:41,041
You don't know what is
happening around you.

1032
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:45,402
You take care of your cow.
Don't know when it will be grabbed.

1033
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:52,487
Still... If it goes on like this will happen?

1034
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,985
That tiger doesn't think on those lines.

1035
01:20:54,088 --> 01:20:58,525
Don't talk nonsense. Atiger!!
It has to get a horn to play the drum!!

1036
01:20:58,926 --> 01:21:01,418
Ramabhadran is here.
Let us tell him the news.

1037
01:21:02,296 --> 01:21:05,459
ltold just a day back.
Now see what has happened.

1038
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,992
What happened?

1039
01:21:07,101 --> 01:21:08,899
Another problem in president's house.

1040
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:10,901
The head of a buried buffalo has come out

1041
01:21:11,105 --> 01:21:13,938
The surprising thing is
that it has no horns.

1042
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:17,003
He saw it when he came out sometime back.

1043
01:21:17,244 --> 01:21:18,541
He fainted as he saw that.

1044
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,338
We are going there.if you want you can come

1045
01:21:20,414 --> 01:21:21,882
You come

1046
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:25,482
Don't think too much. Come with us

1047
01:21:25,653 --> 01:21:28,213
His case is worse...What to do?

1048
01:21:28,455 --> 01:21:29,650
Drink this

1049
01:21:30,424 --> 01:21:31,892
What is this?

1050
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,991
Drink this water

1051
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:45,229
The buffa
o's horns..

1052
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:47,364
They are good for making
handles for knives.

1053
01:21:47,474 --> 01:21:49,135
Maybe someone who wanted that took it off..

1054
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:54,207
President.. I doubt if this was
done by Gopalan, the blacksmith

1055
01:21:54,348 --> 01:21:55,440
Only he can have such guts.....

1056
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:57,516
...To pull out the head of
the buffalo at night.

1057
01:21:58,118 --> 01:22:03,352
Nowl doubt if someone is doing
all these in the name of a tiger.

1058
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:04,424
When did this happen?

1059
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:05,989
I don't know.

1060
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:10,263
I went out to the compound
after I slept off for sometime

1061
01:22:10,497 --> 01:22:12,090
Should not leave it like this

1062
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:14,496
We have to find out the truth behind this

1063
01:22:14,602 --> 01:22:15,660
That is important

1064
01:22:15,736 --> 01:22:16,328
Yes

1065
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:17,893
Any way, we will meet Gopalan and come back

1066
01:22:17,971 --> 01:22:18,938
We have to know what is the reality

1067
01:22:21,475 --> 01:22:23,307
Oh..You reached?

1068
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:27,707
You just dig a deep pit and
bury the buffalo's head?

1069
01:22:28,015 --> 01:22:29,608
But shouldn't we inform the police?

1070
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,288
lam feeling depressed.

1071
01:22:36,023 --> 01:22:40,460

f
 get someone to look after you
well, I could have ended my life.

1072
01:22:41,562 --> 01:22:43,155
Why should I have a life like this?

1073
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:47,329
I was just joking, Girl.

1074
01:22:47,535 --> 01:22:50,027
Where can I go leaving you alone?

1075
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:55,398
I know your tricks!!

1076
01:22:55,576 --> 01:22:58,102
But don't make this a habit.

1077
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,214
Understand?

1078
01:23:01,582 --> 01:23:05,075
Your insistence on going
out at least once in a day

1079
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,687
My dear... I can't tell anything to you

1080
01:23:09,256 --> 01:23:10,348
You get angry ifl say something

1081
01:23:10,524 --> 01:23:13,016
After all, you are a female

1082
01:23:15,262 --> 01:23:19,529
0k 0k I will take you out
not once but twice a day.

1083
01:23:21,068 --> 01:23:22,001
Come

1084
01:23:23,704 --> 01:23:27,231
Come fast. It is getting dark

1085
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:49,086
He is really brave to
stay in this forest alone

1086
01:23:49,363 --> 01:23:50,626
Bro..he is the guy.

1087
01:23:50,798 --> 01:23:51,594
This guy?

1088
01:23:51,732 --> 01:23:52,699
Yes..

1089
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:54,534
Sir..

1090
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:56,796
Just stay there

1091
01:24:01,141 --> 01:24:03,235
We just went to your house.

1092
01:24:03,744 --> 01:24:07,408
I felt very sorry seeing
that animal standing alone

1093
01:24:08,749 --> 01:24:10,239
You didn't recognize us?

1094
01:24:11,185 --> 01:24:12,380
We had come home the other day.

1095
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:15,716
And we almost reached an agreement
on the case of that cow.

1096
01:24:16,457 --> 01:24:21,054
I didn't tell anything. I am not selling it

1097
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:23,024
You keep quite, boys.

1098
01:24:23,364 --> 01:24:27,232
These are my boys.
Slightly over smart since they are young.

1099
01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:32,167
We elders will talk and decide.
You, youngsters don't interfere.

1100
01:24:34,575 --> 01:24:37,306
You have no way out..brother

1101
01:24:37,878 --> 01:24:40,245
We are businessmen since generations.

1102
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:43,146
When we make a profit you
should not beara loss

1103
01:24:44,185 --> 01:24:46,620
lam insistent on that

1104
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:49,714
I came here because she is a fine cow

1105
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:53,424
Just this one is enough for a
wedding party ofa thousand persons

1106
01:24:53,761 --> 01:24:55,251
What else can we do?

1107
01:24:55,496 --> 01:24:57,225
There is also this tiger on the prowl

1108
01:24:57,498 --> 01:24:59,057
There is no tiger here.

1109
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:01,333
And I am not selling this

1110
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:04,263
Don'tjump into such conclusions, Bro

1111
01:25:04,472 --> 01:25:08,375
Don't be scared.
This is a five hundred rupee currency

1112
01:25:08,475 --> 01:25:09,465
No I don't need

1113
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:12,409
Just think that everything is for the good.

1114
01:25:12,546 --> 01:25:13,513
Then we will leave

1115
01:25:25,426 --> 01:25:29,420
Sir.. I know that you don't
feel like leaving this place.

1116
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:30,493
Doesn't matter.

1117
01:25:30,664 --> 01:25:33,531
For the time being, your
suspension has been shelved.

1118
01:25:34,435 --> 01:25:39,305
Now, even if you are transferred to Wy nad
or Nilam bur we will bring you back here.

1119
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:42,705
We need you here.

1120
01:25:45,513 --> 01:25:49,609
This is better than scotch..great

1121
01:25:49,717 --> 01:25:53,881
That is why I said you keep
your foreign liquor aside.

1122
01:25:53,954 --> 01:25:55,820
Let us try the country liquor.

1123
01:25:57,291 --> 01:26:00,317
Then there is no point in blaming us

1124
01:26:01,362 --> 01:26:03,660
If you drink this, you
will be floating in heaven

1125
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:04,630
That is true

1126
01:26:05,432 --> 01:26:09,369
I will come back to this
range maybe in six months.

1127
01:26:09,903 --> 01:26:16,900
But the problem is that by the time I
return these fellows will ruin the forest.

1128
01:26:17,311 --> 01:26:22,340
Yes..These guys, who gave all
this, are denuding the forests.

1129
01:26:22,483 --> 01:26:27,444
Sir..Not like that. They take five
or six loads in an emergency.

1130
01:26:27,588 --> 01:26:29,420
That is all

1131
01:26:29,523 --> 01:26:32,788
But these emergencies have
become regular nowadays.

1132
01:26:33,995 --> 01:26:35,394
The side dishes are over?

1133
01:26:35,496 --> 01:26:37,794
Over...? Molly Kutty..

1134
01:26:40,267 --> 01:26:42,167
This is really excellent

1135
01:26:42,403 --> 01:26:43,928
I prepared all this

1136
01:26:44,205 --> 01:26:45,798
Learned it during my life in the gulf

1137
01:26:45,973 --> 01:26:48,908
So were you a cook there?

1138
01:26:50,244 --> 01:26:54,772
Whatever" Thomachan's
preparation is excellent

1139
01:26:57,284 --> 01:26:59,343
Since it is your send-off.

1140
01:27:00,221 --> 01:27:02,485
Otherwise I would not have
slaughtered this goat...

1141
01:27:02,556 --> 01:27:04,615
...that
 reared like a darling
since the last two years.

1142
01:27:04,725 --> 01:27:08,593
It is better that we eat it
rather than the tiger eating it..

1143
01:27:09,296 --> 01:27:13,426
The sin of a slaughter
gets over when it is eaten

1144
01:27:15,035 --> 01:27:22,408
Mo

y.. She won't come.
She hasn't liked my killing this

1145
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:25,602
There is another one.
 killed only one.

1146
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,541
Then let us move..

1147
01:27:28,315 --> 01:27:29,646
Be seated. I am just coming

1148
01:27:31,485 --> 01:27:32,316
Go

1149
01:27:41,629 --> 01:27:43,757
Dear "Don't worry that we lost one.

1150
01:27:44,465 --> 01:27:47,560
It is better for humans to eat
it than the tiger eating it.

1151
01:27:48,836 --> 01:27:50,702
You go inside and try little

1152
01:27:51,072 --> 01:27:53,598
No..
 don't need You can eat it all alone.

1153
01:27:53,874 --> 01:27:55,808
I was about to throw up seeing all this.

1154
01:27:56,643 --> 01:27:58,407
I can't even think about that.

1155
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:00,709
Don't think about that.

1156
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:04,907
Pack the remaining and let us
send it to Varkey chettan's house

1157
01:28:05,786 --> 01:28:07,254
You can do it yourself.

1158
01:28:07,554 --> 01:28:08,385
I can't.

1159
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:11,884
Kill the other one too.
That will make you merrier

1160
01:28:18,332 --> 01:28:23,532
I have an intention of keeping it here.

1161
01:28:24,438 --> 01:28:26,406
The tiger will fall into the trap.

1162
01:28:27,074 --> 01:28:29,270
After that we don't have to afraid of that.

1163
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:32,912
That is why I don't to want to kill that

1164
01:28:33,748 --> 01:28:36,740
She will put on 5 kgs more
weight in three months.

1165
01:28:37,585 --> 01:28:38,575
Then we will think about it.

1166
01:28:38,853 --> 01:28:39,718
Sir

1167
01:28:40,454 --> 01:28:43,424
He has come. Where were you..you ass?

1168
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,557
How long should I wait for you.

1169
01:28:49,029 --> 01:28:51,498
We were giving a party
to the forest officials.

1170
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:54,461
I have managed your case.

1171
01:28:54,535 --> 01:28:58,438
You can grace your cow or buffalo
or whatever in the forest.

1172
01:28:58,773 --> 01:29:02,641
Even if you fell all the
forest trees, they won't move

1173
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:08,639
You bury the waste in the bucket.

1174
01:29:09,116 --> 01:29:10,914
Dogs should not pull it out.

1175
01:29:11,919 --> 01:29:16,379
Killed one. But it is better
than the tiger catching it

1176
01:29:19,526 --> 01:29:22,086
Pour me a drink too.
 wll be back

1177
01:29:22,396 --> 01:29:24,660
I will console her and come

1178
01:30:16,884 --> 01:30:18,079
Give way

1179
01:30:18,219 --> 01:30:19,550
Oh..My

1180
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:22,119
How do you walk on the road?

1181
01:30:22,423 --> 01:30:23,720
There is no point injumping in front of
this if you want get yourself killed.

1182
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,020
Go to a running train

1183
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,117
What the he

...Such nasty guys!!

1184
01:30:31,131 --> 01:30:34,396
Are you mad..Get up and get lost ..

1185
01:30:35,135 --> 01:30:37,069
I said you get lost...

1186
01:30:40,474 --> 01:30:43,444
Some bugger will jump in ..bad times for me

1187
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:52,715
Today's business is af
op..

1188
01:30:52,887 --> 01:30:54,719

1191
01:31:13,207 --> 01:31:17,144
It was just about dawn when we saw

1192
01:31:17,478 --> 01:31:18,946
Who saw the body first? You?

1193
01:31:19,046 --> 01:31:19,911
Not me Sir

1194
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,479
Yes Sirl saw it first.

1195
01:31:21,582 --> 01:31:23,516
When I was going for work in the
morning, saw it lying here.

1196
01:31:23,651 --> 01:31:24,914
I called them here

1197
01:31:25,285 --> 01:31:25,877
Dude

1198
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:26,544

Sir There is a wound on his leg.Has swollen

1204
01:31:35,963 --> 01:31:37,453
Maybe snakebite!?

1205
01:31:37,731 --> 01:31:38,823
No Not like that Sir

1206
01:31:38,966 --> 01:31:40,161
How do you know that?

1207
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:45,795
He has been limping since many days.
We all know that.

1208
01:31:46,106 --> 01:31:47,665
It is said that he was hit by a bicycle.

1209
01:31:57,251 --> 01:31:59,652
A very nice one.How aristocraticl!

1210
01:32:02,756 --> 01:32:05,726
It should not go to them in any case

1211
01:32:08,629 --> 01:32:09,255
Who is that?

1212
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:11,926
You come here. We want to see you

1213
01:32:14,835 --> 01:32:15,893
What happened?

1214
01:32:18,205 --> 01:32:23,507
We heard something.
Heard that your cow has been sold.

1215
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:25,037
That too to some slaughterers.

1216
01:32:25,145 --> 01:32:25,907
ls it true?

1217
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:30,244
No Don't do that.
Don't you know that killing a cow is a sin?

1218
01:32:31,652 --> 01:32:32,949
Are you feeding it well?

1219
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:35,245
Where is its calf?

1220
01:32:35,689 --> 01:32:36,781
It has not delivered.

1221
01:32:36,957 --> 01:32:39,858
Doesn't look like that.
Did you sell that too?

1222
01:32:41,328 --> 01:32:45,265
They will come again to bargain.
Tell them we are here.

1223
01:32:47,168 --> 01:32:50,763
Look He is not well. Let us go

1224
01:32:53,174 --> 01:32:56,235
Let us see if a slaughterer takes
it away when we are all here.

1225
01:32:57,011 --> 01:32:58,206
Let us see..

1226
01:32:58,312 --> 01:32:59,541
Yes

1227
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:11,819
What happened? I was not here

1228
01:33:11,959 --> 01:33:14,018
I went to my daughters'
since she was pregnant.

1229
01:33:15,129 --> 01:33:18,121
Looks like someone thrashed you up.

1230
01:33:18,299 --> 01:33:20,290
A tit for tat for you

1231
01:33:27,007 --> 01:33:31,774
Still you are limping!! I told you
I will come with you to a doctor

01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:33,310
It is ok

1233
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:37,714
Where are you goimg limping like this?

1234
01:33:37,852 --> 01:33:40,082
lam going to Thomas sir's house.

1235
01:33:40,655 --> 01:33:42,919
So you didn't know anything?

1236
01:33:43,691 --> 01:33:45,318
Tiger got into his house last night.

1237
01:33:46,293 --> 01:33:50,753
When he saw the tiger through
the window Thomachan fainted.

1238
01:33:51,432 --> 01:33:54,732
He is not conscious even now.

1239
01:33:55,069 --> 01:33:58,630
He is in hospital now.
You go there if you want to meet him

1240
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:03,108
I heard about that.
Sister had sent someone to me to go there

1241
01:34:05,146 --> 01:34:07,342
ls it. 0k Then.

1242
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:10,674
In the evening, the president
has convened a meeting.

1243
01:34:10,985 --> 01:34:13,079
To discuss about the tiger

1244
01:34:13,354 --> 01:34:15,254
If possible, you also should come

1245
01:34:17,057 --> 01:34:18,183
Poor guy

1246
01:34:27,368 --> 01:34:28,426
Sister

1247
01:34:29,436 --> 01:34:31,234
Your leg is not ok yet?

1248
01:34:31,405 --> 01:34:34,431
That is why you were not seen here.
Didn't you knowthe news?

1249
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:35,641
What happened?

1250
01:34:36,143 --> 01:34:42,082
He fainted seeing the tiger at night.
He says he saw the tiger in our front yard.

1251
01:34:42,249 --> 01:34:44,877
I checked and could not see
a tiger's footstep even

1252
01:34:45,019 --> 01:34:45,884
He must have just felt it.

1253
01:34:45,986 --> 01:34:48,080
If the tiger had really come this
goat would not have remained here.

1254
01:34:48,689 --> 01:34:52,421
That is out opinion too. If the tiger had
come it would have eaten the goat first.

1255
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,863
But he is very scared. He is delirious.

1256
01:34:57,831 --> 01:35:00,960
Anyway, the president has convened a
meeting to decide about the tiger.

1257
01:35:01,902 --> 01:35:03,700
If possible, you too attend that

1258
01:35:03,971 --> 01:35:05,268
Has he regained consciousness?

1259
01:35:05,406 --> 01:35:08,967
I have to go and check.
lam going to the hospital

1260
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:12,836
I have kept your food there.

1261
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:14,880

f
 don't go immediately
he will get angry.

1262
01:35:14,949 --> 01:35:17,919
My brother's son.
I asked him to stand by when I came here

1263
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:28,387
We are going through times of severe
challenges that we haven't faced till now.

1264
01:35:38,839 --> 01:35:45,939
Ourselves and our ancestors
who fought against

1265
01:35:46,013 --> 01:35:53,215
all sons of natural
calamities to make a living

1266
01:35:53,354 --> 01:35:58,758
.are going through serious crisis.

1267
01:35:59,259 --> 01:36:07,259
We have experienced wild elephant attacks
on our farmlands since many years.

1268
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,038
Should wild elephants
come to our homes, then?

1269
01:36:15,142 --> 01:36:17,167
It's ok. Speak softly.

1270
01:36:17,311 --> 01:36:23,478
Everyone of you know that we are
facing another challenge now.

1271
01:36:24,018 --> 01:36:31,926
The goats, buffalos and cows that we rear for
making a living are being threatened by a tiger,

1272
01:36:32,093 --> 01:36:34,323
I don't know if it is just one
tiger or a large number of them

1273
01:36:34,462 --> 01:36:38,956
That tiger is having a
free prowl on our land.

1274
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:45,868
The govts at the centre and the
state have not been listening...

1275
01:36:46,106 --> 01:36:50,304
...to our complaints and demands for
protection, from wild animal attacks.

1276
01:36:50,911 --> 01:36:53,573
But I must say that some
of them have been helpful

1277
01:36:53,881 --> 01:36:57,579
The forest dept helped
us as much as they can

1278
01:36:57,918 --> 01:37:02,583
But no tiger fell into their tiger trap.

1279
01:37:03,023 --> 01:37:05,993
And we have lost hope that
one would get trapped

1280
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,356
In the meantime, the tiger
continues its attack

1281
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:11,430
We have arranged this
meeting in such a situation

1282
01:37:11,565 --> 01:37:13,863
President" Don't take things
in such a silly fashion

1283
01:37:14,101 --> 01:37:15,398
Let the forest dept go to hell

1284
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:18,100
What we need now is a surgical strike

1285
01:37:18,472 --> 01:37:21,373
The tiger should be caught under
the leadership of the panchayath.

1286
01:37:21,876 --> 01:37:25,506
Because some people have arrived here to buy
our cows in the name of the tiger threat.

1287
01:37:25,613 --> 01:37:27,843
Stop it. None should play a
tiger and cow game here.

1288
01:37:27,982 --> 01:37:30,178
We need freedom to rearthe cows.

1289
01:37:30,317 --> 01:37:33,514
Under the threat of the tiger we should
give freedom to people to sell the comrs.

1290
01:37:33,587 --> 01:37:35,077
No one should talk against that.

1291
01:37:35,389 --> 01:37:38,154
In the name of a tiger, we will not let
anyone kill all our cows and sale beef here.

1292
01:37:38,325 --> 01:37:39,815
Try doing that somewhere else

1293
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:40,620
Get lost..Dude

1294
01:37:40,895 --> 01:37:43,193
Those eat food will decide
what they should eat.

1295
01:37:43,397 --> 01:37:47,163
That is not right. This is a country where
millions worship cow as their mother.

1296
01:37:47,334 --> 01:37:48,028
Sit down there

1297
01:37:48,168 --> 01:37:48,862
You sit first

1298
01:37:50,304 --> 01:37:52,295
Please be calm and listen to me

1299
01:37:53,174 --> 01:37:56,508
Listen to me.

1300
01:38:02,249 --> 01:38:03,148
Listen to me

1301
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:03,614
Hello

1302
01:38:14,295 --> 01:38:17,390
Sit down or else I will
dissolve the meeting now.

1303
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:22,066
Don't look at this in a communal angle.

1304
01:38:22,236 --> 01:38:25,069
This is an issue that concerns
the existence of the people here

1305
01:38:25,239 --> 01:38:29,938
Due to that tiger we have already
lost a large number of animals.

1306
01:38:30,144 --> 01:38:32,135
And the number of the lost
animals will only increase.

1307
01:38:32,212 --> 01:38:37,378
So, all of you should unite
to solve this problem

1308
01:38:37,485 --> 01:38:42,446
If you here any strange noise hit
the drums to let others know

1309
01:38:42,556 --> 01:38:45,321
I would like to remind you that
if a common enemy attacks us...

1310
01:38:45,693 --> 01:38:52,224
...if we don't stand united that
will lead to our destruction only

1311
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:57,667
Manoj, Isn't it him going?
Let us ask about the cow?

1312
01:39:00,508 --> 01:39:02,067
Why didn't you attend the meeting today?

1313
01:39:02,176 --> 01:39:06,079
I had come. Since I was not well
I didn't sit though fully.

1314
01:39:07,248 --> 01:39:08,374
Your cow is alright...?

1315
01:39:08,482 --> 01:39:09,313
Oh..Nothing

1316
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:13,311
If someone comes to buy that, let us know

1317
01:39:13,487 --> 01:39:15,285
Understand?
