1
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,550
'I am Chaman Kohli.'

2
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,310
'The eldest son of the 
Kohli Family in Rajouri Garden.'

3
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,800
'A Hindi Professor at the 
Delhi University on weekdays.'

4
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,550
'And a 30-year-old eligible 
bachelor on weekends.'

5
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,970
Get lost! Get lost! 
Don't come here again.

6
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,270
'Like every other Sunday..'

7
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,250
'..my family and I were visiting 
a prospective girl's family.'

8
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,080
'What happened was, 
my pictures in the matrimony site..'

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,360
'..turned out to be 5 years old.'

10
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,000
'The ones shoving the 
Kohli Family out now..'

11
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,960
'..were not so long 
ago trying to fawn us.'

12
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,390
- That's amazing. 
- So, let's get started?

13
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,930
What do you do, son?

14
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,460
He does Whatsapp.

15
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,500
Don't we all!

16
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,780
- There, that's my younger daughter. 
- Come..

17
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,030
Come here, dear.

18
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,470
Meet the Kohli Family, 
he's the eldest son.

19
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,580
Have a seat. Come here.

20
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,820
That's my eldest daughter and her son.

21
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,100
Go and say hello to uncle, son.

22
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,950
- Come on, son. 
- Very good!

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,910
Good boy.

24
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,540
What's your name?

25
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,970
Bittu!

26
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,420
Frauds!

27
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,780
You post a handsome 
looking picture of him..

28
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,980
..but he turned out to be a bald guy.

29
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,580
- You bloody.. 
- Get lost!

30
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,980
That's my younger brother, Goldie.

31
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,820
A full time idler who 
is pursuing a master's degree.

32
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,980
Well, just for the heck of it.

33
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,140
Stop it, Goldie.

34
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,580
- Bloody hoggers. 
- Here's your cheap Samosa, oldie!

35
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,340
Meet the Papa Kohli.

36
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,620
A clerk at Delhi 
Municipal Cooperation.

37
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,940
In the past five years, 
his hair has turned grey..

38
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,420
..trying to find a match for me.

39
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,260
You are an oldie!

40
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,900
- Your son is an oldie and a baldie! 
- Oh really?

41
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,540
Don't you have a mirror at home?

42
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,160
Where's your hair, you baldie!

43
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,450
That's my mom.

44
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,030
She still believes that I am quite 
handsome, even if the world doesn't.

45
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,940
Even after 50 rejections, 
she hasn't lost hope.

46
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,060
- Baldie! Baldie! Baldie! 
- All of you are so gross!

47
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,980
- You.. 
- You..

48
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,100
- You.. 
- Come back.

49
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,820
- You.. 
- Mummy, let's go.

50
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,660
- Don't come here again. 
- Come on, get lost!

51
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,460
- Come on, get inside. 
- You get lost from here.

52
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,180
I'll make you go bald if 
you ever bring a proposal again.

53
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,660
- Stop! Let me put a jinx on her. 
- Come on, let's go from here.

54
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,060
- Go ahead. Come on. 
- Let me put a jinx on her.

55
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,740
May every male in your 
family be forever bald.

56
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,820
Please don't ask us to meet 
such disgusting families again.

57
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,260
I agree. They looked 
like a family of hooligans.

58
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,300
- It is not so. - My son has 
a narrow escape. Good riddance.

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,180
You know so many people. 
Why can't you find us a good match?

60
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,380
What is this?

61
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,540
Did a crow do that or a pigeon?

62
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,900
- What? 
- Shit.

63
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,020
- Do you have to say that? 
- But it is shit. Have a look.

64
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,900
Oh, I got it.

65
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,900
- Rajni is behind this. 
- This shit?

66
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,180
- No, black magic. - Come on, 
how do you expect Rajni to sit here?

67
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,660
You might think that 
she is very naive..

68
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,500
..but she keeps doing 
black magic all the time.

69
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,500
Whatever.

70
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,460
- Brother, please introduce us 
to Mr. Shastri. - Okay.

71
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,580
He predicted that Trump 
would be America's Prime Minister.

72
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,580
And it came true.

73
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,740
Mummy, he's the President, 
not the Prime Minister.

74
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,380
He is something, right?

75
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,900
- Don't argue with me, Goldie. 
- You keep crushing the candies.

76
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,780
- This isn't Candy Crush, papa. 
- He behaves as if he is some minister.

77
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,660
Look, his planetary positions 
bypassing the wedding platform..

78
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,740
..will take a shortcut 
through asceticism..

79
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,140
..and lead him directly to Moksa.

80
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,180
Great.

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,260
Amazing.

82
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,980
That means everything is fine.

83
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,980
This means if he doesn't 
get married before he turns 31..

84
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,060
..then he will forever 
lead an ascetic life.

85
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,420
In English, it's called..

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,420
- Celebrate. 
- Not celebrate, celibate.

87
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,980
- We will celebrate. 
- What?

88
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,940
Why will we celebrate?

89
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,300
It's not celebrate, it's celibate.

90
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,780
This means he will 
stay single all his life.

91
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,540
He will never get married.

92
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,940
- What? 
- Yes.

93
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,900
What are you saying, Guruji?

94
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,180
It's not me, 
his planetary positions suggest that.

95
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,140
Please don't put this on me.

96
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,860
- This is so wrong. 
- No..

97
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,620
- Whether it's wrong or right, 
it is what is it is. - Don't cry, Guddi.

98
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,260
- This is a big thing. 
- Mummy..

99
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,660
- What is trhis? 
- He is my eldest son.

100
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,580
Please don't cry.

101
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,620
- Eldest or youngest doesn't matter. 
- How will the youngest one..

102
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,900
- Please, don't cry.. 
- ..get married if he doesn't?

103
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,780
- Please calm her down. 
- Every mother has a dream..

104
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,740
- ..of getting her son married. - Please 
don't cry. I am begging you not to.

105
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,540
- Is there a solution? 
- There is.

106
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,340
Get him married before he turns 31.

107
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,820
This is the solution.

108
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,420
Okay.

109
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,340
That can be done.

110
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,180
It's okay, son. Okay?

111
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,860
Give the offerings to everyone.

112
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
- Celebrate. 
- Celebrate.

113
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,420
"My nose ring is trying 
to say something.."

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,420
Come on, man.

115
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,580
This is Joginder's fault.

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Mummy, it's the fault of 
that 5-year-old picture and the cap.

117
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,220
It's not like we love to lie.

118
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,140
No one's ready to meet a bald guy.

119
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,020
I mean that once they meet the boy, 
they might like him, his family.

120
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,500
And things might eventually work out.

121
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,740
Someone tell me what's 
the use of hair anyway.

122
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,700
They are useless, 
just like fingernails.

123
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,020
He is a good guy. 
He has a government job.

124
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,900
He is a professor in college. 
What else do they want?

125
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,180
Don't worry.

126
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,220
Nirmala has some herbal oil.

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,780
Apply that and you will 
have hair sprouting in three days.

128
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,340
- I guarantee that. 
- The hair oil won't help.

129
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,380
I think you should 
go for hair transplant.

130
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,540
Don't you dare go for 
hair transplant, Chaman.

131
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,500
- But.. 
- Do you know how risky it is?

132
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,260
- Surinder's nephew got it 
done last year. - And?

133
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,620
He passed away.

134
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,940
- Really? 
- Yes.

135
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,780
You are under my oath.

136
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
We wouldn't have to 
go hunting for a girl..

137
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,620
..if only he would have 
opted for love marriage.

138
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,020
You know, we had a love 
marriage way back in 1986.

139
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,180
He's useless.

140
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,900
At least try.

141
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,820
Why don't you just keep 
quiet and cut the salad?

142
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,140
- Fine. 
- Don't stress yourself, son.

143
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,540
I'll find such a lovely girl for you..

144
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,980
..that the whole of Rajouri 
will burn with jealousy.

145
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,060
Why not go for the 
whole of Delhi, Guddi?

146
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,580
- Vivid imaginations don't get 
taxed as yet.- Please, keep quiet.

147
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,100
No one needs to find anyone.

148
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Did I ask you to?

149
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,660
Oh really? 
So you want to be a 'celebrity'?

150
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,780
Mummy, it's not celebrity, 
it's celibate.

151
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,300
Actors are called celebrity.

152
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,620
- Don't interrupt me. - Why don't you 
say single and end the argument?

153
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,260
Fine, you will end up being that.

154
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,420
You know you have a flaw.

155
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,700
So what? 
People can be happy without marriage.

156
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,860
Really? Tell me one name.

157
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,940
Salman Khan.

158
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,100
Their case is different.

159
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,820
They at least get some..

160
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,260
What?

161
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,700
Girls. They can find girls.

162
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,100
- They have had many options. 
- Yes. Right!

163
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,860
I can be happy even 
without a girl in my life.

164
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,620
Yeah, right.

165
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,220
Pushpa.

166
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,780
I've told you a thousand 
times to dress decently.

167
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,460
- There are three males in here. 
- Calm down. This is not her fault.

168
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,300
This jar will come flying at you next.

169
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,700
Water, please.

170
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,660
You want water? Here's your water.

171
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,480
'Suhani and Piyush got engaged.'

172
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,060
'Hey, congratulations guys.'

173
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,520
'Congrats.'

174
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,320
'S**t! The last one is also down.'

175
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,000
'Everyone from our 
batch is married now.'

176
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,850
'Hey not yet, 
our Chaman is still pending.'

177
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,920
'Is he still thinking about marriage?'

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,600
'I thought he must 
have given up by now.'

179
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,720
Hello?

180
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,360
I was waiting for your call.

181
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,120
What?

182
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,800
Listen, can we meet tomorrow?

183
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,360
My friend has an empty flat.

184
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Let's go there.

185
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you think I am that kind of a guy?

186
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,220
Have I ever even touched you?

187
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,320
Come on now, give me a kiss.

188
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,880
A small one?

189
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,520
You know I cannot sleep without one.

190
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,740
I feel restless.

191
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,680
Give me a small one. 
Please give it.

192
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,000
This is meant for the cheek.

193
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
Now one on my lips.

194
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
What are you doing?

195
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,480
Goldie, I can't find my slippers.

196
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,800
Can't find your slippers?

197
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
Take mine.

198
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,000
Pass them to me.

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
Here.

200
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,760
Hello!

201
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,680
What happened!

202
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,080
You are supposed to sleep on bed, 
not tittle-tattle.

203
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Get out. Leave.

204
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,040
Fine. I am leaving.

205
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,840
It's not like I love 
to sleep with you.

206
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,800
Papa asked me to sleep 
here till you don't get married.

207
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,400
Said we would save some electricity.

208
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,120
Now it seems like I'll be 
spending the rest of my life here.

209
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,480
Stop blabbering and leave. 
Tell papa, I'll pay the bill.

210
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,360
- Hello? 
- Disgusting!

211
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,520
- No, there was some disturbance. 
- Go.

212
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,080
He's just frustrated. Nothing else.

213
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,120
"Have no doubt, 
this moon stands out"

214
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,440
"No hair on the head, 
I feel so restless"

215
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,840
Don't worry about that..

216
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,800
No, I am just massaging 
my head with some oil.

217
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,560
"Have no doubt, 
this moon stands out"

218
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,200
"No hair on the head, 
I feel so restless"

219
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,160
Chaman, pay respect to your 
grandfather before you leave. Okay?

220
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,960
"No hair to provide shade"

221
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,640
"No protection from the sun, mate"

222
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,440
"Overshadowing my looks always, 
what a fate"

223
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,440
"Everyone is awed at the sight"

224
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,200
"This moon shines bright"

225
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,080
Goldie took the car, again?

226
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,280
Who needs the car more, 
that useless idler or me?

227
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
I am the one who makes 70,000 a month.

228
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,040
So what? 
Why don't you take the scooter?

229
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
It's his age to have some fun.

230
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,920
The car will come in handy to him.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
You only use it as a conveyance.

232
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,360
No, I was talking to Chaman.

233
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,480
"This moon shines bright"

234
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,640
"Autumn is distressed, 
life is a mess"

235
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,600
"I will dance, 
if I loss them by chance"

236
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,680
"Autumn is distressed, 
life is a mess"

237
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,760
"I will dance, 
if I loss them by chance"

238
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:11,480
"This cruel world taunts me"

239
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,240
"This barren land 
has been earned by me"

240
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,600
"I cause a commotion everywhere I go"

241
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,640
"Everyone is awed at the sight"

242
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,800
"This moon shines bright"

243
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
"Whether it's day or night"

244
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,680
"This moon shines bright"

245
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,640
"Mirror mocks me"

246
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
"Everyone ridicules me"

247
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
"Everyone is awed at the sight"

248
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,760
"This moon shines bright"

249
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,440
"This moon shines bright"

250
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,680
"This moon shines bright"

251
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,810
"This moon shines bright"

252
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,320
This is the result 
of tolerating atrocities.

253
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,720
By being gentle, man losses terror..

254
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,960
Baldie!

255
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,520
Baldhead!

256
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,960
Sir, what is the result 
of tolerating atrocities?

257
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,360
This looks like you.

258
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,880
This is you.

259
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,600
Nice.

260
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Thank you, sir.

261
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,640
Sir, he was misbehaving. 
He was making fun of me.

262
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,040
What did you say?

263
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,720
That wasn't me, sir.

264
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Sir?

265
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,480
Sir, I want a day off tomorrow.

266
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
I need to drop my wife 
off to her sister's place.

267
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
Okay.

268
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,040
Thank you, sir.

269
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,760
Wife, sir.

270
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,360
I got the permission.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
His wife or someone else's?

272
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,000
- Sir.. 
- What do you think?

273
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,480
What does he talk about with his wife, 
seven years after marriage?

274
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,440
Okay.

275
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,840
What were you saying?

276
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,120
Nothing, sir.

277
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,840
Sir..

278
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,400
Sir..

279
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,120
Baldie.

280
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,000
- But sir, I didn't say it. 
- Shut up.

281
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,520
Your parents send you here for this?

282
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Bloody good-for-nothing loafers.

283
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,600
They'll either keep staring at the 
girls or troubling their professors.

284
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
He's as old as your father.

285
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
Sir, I am just 30.

286
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,890
I am just be seven or 
eight years older than him.

287
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,520
Chaman, you look a tad matured.

288
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Fine.

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,960
- Sir! 
- 1000 rupees. Right away.

290
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,800
Sorry.

291
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,040
- Pay up. 
- Next time, sir.

292
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,280
- Pay up. 
- Sir..

293
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,360
I don't have change, sir.

294
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
You do have any change?

295
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
No, sir.

296
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,080
- I'll pay it tomorrow, sir.- 
Shut up.

297
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,040
Let's do one thing..

298
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,080
You say it again leave this here.

299
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
What do I say, sir?

300
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,200
This is wrong, sir.

301
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,000
How can you let him insult me again?

302
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,800
Chaman, I have fined him.

303
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,610
Let's compromise and end the matter.

304
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,640
How can I say it, sir?

305
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,880
Then you should have change on you.

306
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,920
I am not running a grocery 
store here to have change handy.

307
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,640
I am getting late for class. 
Say it and end the matter.

308
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,840
Sir..

309
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,920
Baldie.

310
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,200
Raj, when did you get married?

311
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,920
Seven years back.

312
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
We'll be celebrating 
our anniversary next month.

313
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,720
Great! Arranged marriage?

314
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,960
No, sir. Love marriage.

315
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
We fell in love.

316
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,120
How? 
I mean, how did it happen?

317
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,240
Where did you two first meet?

318
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,320
At a wedding.

319
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
- At a wedding? 
- Yes.

320
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,040
My friend was getting married.

321
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,520
She was the bride's friend.

322
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,560
That's where we saw each 
other for the first time.

323
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,760
We fell in love on the dance floor.

324
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
And then, we got married.

325
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,960
You found love at 
your friend's wedding?

326
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,400
Yes, that's what friend's 
weddings are for.

327
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
You get free alcohol and 
you get to flirt with girls.

328
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
Where's my tea?

329
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,240
This feels so dry without it!

330
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,790
Yes?

331
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,070
Join us, bro.

332
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,550
Shikha was just joking.

333
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,550
I'll apologise on her behalf.

334
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,070
No, you guys have fun.

335
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,470
Why are you doing this?

336
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,670
What's Piyush and Suhani's fault?

337
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,520
Please join us.

338
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,840
At the last minute? 
I don't even have a suit ready.

339
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,690
Come in casuals then.

340
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,460
Else, I'll arrange for a suit for you.

341
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,660
Fine, let me see. I'll let you know.

342
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,820
I'll come up with something.

343
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
Bye.

344
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,020
Wait right there, Chaman.

345
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,540
Apply the oil before you leave.

346
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,820
What are you doing, mummy? 
It won't work.

347
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,620
I have tried a million things already.

348
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,300
Where are you going all dressed up?

349
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,980
To a friend's wedding.

350
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Aren't you tired of dancing 
at your friends' weddings?

351
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,860
Why do you always 
keep taunting me, papa?

352
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,540
I am not taunting you. I am only 
stating a fact. Don't waste your time.

353
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,020
What's more important, 
dancing at your friend's wedding..

354
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,180
..or finding a girl for yourself?

355
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,660
That's why I am going there. 
To flirt..

356
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
To find a girl.

357
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Flirt, eh!

358
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,180
There comes the professor.

359
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,820
Looking good, professor.

360
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,500
- All good? 
- All good.

361
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,660
Managed to arrange a suit then?

362
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,660
- Join us. 
- Chaman sir, please forgive me.

363
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,140
You felt so bad about what I said?

364
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
It's cool.

365
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,540
It's cool? 
Then you just wait and watch.

366
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,220
I'll surely set you 
up with someone tonight.

367
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Great.

368
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,460
- There are quite a few 
beautiful girls here. - Really?

369
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,220
"The kohl in your 
eyes is worth a million"

370
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,620
"Your big bright eyes 
are targeting billions"

371
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,380
"Stealthily stealing hearts, 
your outfit, my dear"

372
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,260
"Leaving everyone awestruck, 
your outfit, my dear"

373
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,660
"It's killing the boys, 
your outfit, my dear"

374
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,220
"Gucci and Prada 
guys are also your fan"

375
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,540
"All the brands want 
you to promote them"

376
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,620
"Mesmerises even the young lads, 
your outfit, my dear"

377
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,620
"It's killing the boys, 
your outfit, my dear"

378
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,860
"Leaving everyone awestruck, 
your outfit, my dear"

379
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,660
"It's killing the boys, 
your outfit, my dear"

380
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,020
You see that?

381
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,500
He's on a roll.

382
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,900
So professor..

383
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,900
Where's your girl?

384
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,860
Where's my bro's chick?

385
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,820
I'm chatting with her.

386
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,700
She is busy with her friends.

387
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,020
She said she'd meet 
me after the wedding.

388
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,740
Well done, bro!

389
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,860
She seems too busy, don't you think?

390
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,700
What the duck!

391
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,500
My bro's girl..

392
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,540
Someone's getting cosy 
with her behind the bushes.

393
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,660
Move aside.

394
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,420
- That's not her. 
- That's her.

395
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,340
- That's not her. 
- That's her.

396
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,020
- Let's go. 
- No. That's not her.

397
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,300
- Let's go. 
- No. That's not her.

398
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,420
Let's go, that's her.

399
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,660
- I'll beat you. 
- Let's go.

400
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,900
You bloodsucking Dracula, 
let go of her.

401
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,900
This is the wrong guy.

402
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,540
Your guy is over there.

403
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,700
That's Goldie. Let him go. 
He's Chaman's brother.

404
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,900
Chaman's brother?

405
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,300
Don't you have any shame?

406
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
You are hitting on 
your brother's wife?

407
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,420
Wife? What wife?

408
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,100
Isn't he your husband?

409
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,860
Professor!

410
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
What is this nonsense?

411
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,060
What the hell are you doing there?

412
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,980
Come here and handle your own mess.

413
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,420
Let it go, Rathee.

414
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,940
It's cool. It happens.

415
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,940
It's cool?

416
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,460
We aren't still that westernised, 
you dunce..

417
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,020
..that brothers can 
take turns at this.

418
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,460
Can someone please tell 
me what the hell is happening.

419
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,740
Come here, professor.

420
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,780
I just don't understand 
these Delhi girls.

421
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,180
Excuse me, South Delhi.

422
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,980
I am from South Ex. Okay?

423
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,340
South Ex.

424
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
What are you doing here?

425
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,900
Speak up.

426
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,140
We just came here for the free food.

427
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,860
We didn't know that 
it's your friend's wedding.

428
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,580
We wouldn't have come here otherwise.

429
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,660
- He planned to devour the girl as well. 
- No.

430
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,180
You are welcome to continue 
with your family drama.

431
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,140
Will you please let me go?

432
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,420
Madam, he is your boyfriend.

433
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,700
Go with him.

434
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
What boyfriend?

435
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,020
Weren't you and he hook.. talking?

436
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,460
Talking about?

437
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,140
He's been harassing me.

438
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,100
He has been following me everywhere.

439
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,540
He waited outside the 
ladies washroom for 15 minutes.

440
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,500
He has been messaging me non-stop.

441
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,140
I replied after he sent 20 messages.

442
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,860
I am sick and tired of this drama.

443
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,100
I am leaving.

444
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,660
Bloody hooligans.

445
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,820
She's your girlfriend?

446
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,900
No, I met her at the snack stall.

447
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,340
And you groped her?

448
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,980
You are lucky that 
you are his brother.

449
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,820
I'd have stuffed you 
in the boot and dumped you..

450
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,220
..in the middle of nowhere otherwise.

451
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,940
Where?

452
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,420
Sorry.

453
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,390
Sorry.

454
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,340
Nothing. He was just 
a coward from Haryana.

455
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,500
Two whacks and he learnt his lesson.

456
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,420
That girl?

457
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
She was poison.

458
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,740
Poison.

459
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,140
I couldn't have a proper dinner so..

460
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,100
Wait, I'll serve you dinner.

461
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,300
- Goldie! 
- Mummy!

462
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,660
Let me go.

463
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,380
Papa! Let me go, bro!

464
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,500
Papa!

465
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,420
Help me!

466
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,940
Are you hurt, bro?

467
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,420
- You bloody.. 
- Help!

468
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,340
- Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. 
- Help me, he's going to kill me.

469
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,540
Oh my God, what happened?

470
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,500
- I am warning you, get down 
right this minute. - What happened?

471
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,420
Can't you see? He is possessed.

472
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,900
Yes, I am possessed. 
Let me show you how.

473
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,820
You creep!

474
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,500
- Shame on you! 
- What are you doing?

475
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,780
How dare you hit your 
father with your shoes!

476
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,700
- Mummy, help me! 
- Shut up. You too shut up.

477
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,740
- You shut up. - Strange woman, 
what is wrong with you?

478
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,300
- Stop! 
- Don't turn this into a fish market!

479
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,900
Why are you hitting him? Stop!

480
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,940
Don't fight..

481
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,900
- Stop! Why did you close the door? 
- Where are they?

482
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,540
- Go after them. 
- Move aside.

483
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,100
- Stop! I am warning you. 
- I'll get hurt!

484
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,140
You bloody..!

485
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,780
- Where are you running? 
- I'll get hurt.

486
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,220
Stop.

487
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,260
Brother, I beg you..

488
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,940
I am telling you. 
Just say sorry.

489
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,780
I am telling you, I'll beat you.

490
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,060
Stop it. Stop it.

491
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,380
Leave it.

492
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,980
Mummy..

493
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,100
- I didn't beat you yet. 
- No.

494
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,580
You want to consume poison? Right?

495
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,940
- I'll give you poison. Wait! 
- No.

496
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,180
- I don't want to consume poison. 
- Chaman!

497
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,300
- You want to consume poison? 
- What is going on?

498
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,300
- You.. 
- Stop it, Chaman!

499
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,020
- I don't want it. 
- Chaman! Chaman!

500
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,340
- Chaman! Let him go! Let him go! 
- What are you doing?

501
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,460
Let him go! Come on.

502
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,580
- What are you doing? Let him go! 
- I am warning you.

503
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,140
Shameless! Rascal!

504
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,660
- Come here. 
- What happened? Tell me?

505
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,510
- What happened? 
- He's a bloody pervert.

506
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,000
What's this commotion about 
in the middle of the night?

507
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,060
- What's going on, Mr. Kohli? 
- What is going to happen?

508
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,580
Can't you see we 
are getting embarrassed?

509
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,620
- Do you want to embarrass us 
in front of the society? - Stop it.

510
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,220
- Come down. - We've been staying in 
Rajouri since three generations.

511
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,260
At least take your forefathers' 
reputation into consideration.

512
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,780
Get down before you dent the car!

513
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,340
He has already caused a lot of dents.

514
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,380
Stop it.

515
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,600
At least tell us what 
happened between you two.

516
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Speak up.

517
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,500
Ask him.

518
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,260
Chaman, tell us what happened.

519
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,660
- Speak up. 
- Tell us.

520
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,060
Strange fellow. He just left. 
You tell us.

521
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,980
How much for the taro root?

522
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,340
- 15 for a quarter of a kilo. 
- Okay.

523
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,340
Hello.

524
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,220
Mr. Kohli?

525
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
He is 30, right?

526
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,300
- Chaman? 
- Yes.

527
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,440
There is a lot of 
fire within at this age.

528
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,060
Do you understand?

529
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,420
So, he might go to different 
places to find relief.

530
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,860
You know at those kinds of places?

531
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,820
He could get AIDS.

532
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,380
That's why rapes happen. 
Because of frustration.

533
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,420
Oh come on, sister.

534
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,780
- Who says such things? 
- Shut up.

535
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,030
I am talking to him.

536
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:16,780
I mean we should find a solution 
before something untoward happens.

537
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,140
We will need to find a solution.

538
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,040
I'll go find a solution.

539
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,580
Hurry up.

540
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,260
Testosterone, medication..

541
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,150
Release..

542
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,700
What have you been blabbering since 
morning? What do you plan to discuss?

543
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,260
You won't understand, 
let me handle this.

544
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,020
But what are you about to do?

545
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,980
Do my duty as a father.

546
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,580
Do you understand?

547
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,900
May I come in, son?

548
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,420
Do you need to ask?

549
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,020
Yes, right!

550
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,020
Gulab Jamun (Sweets) for you.

551
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,580
Good.

552
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,020
Good.

553
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,820
What is it?

554
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,660
Nothing.

555
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,260
I thought we should 
have a father-son talk.

556
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,700
- A father-son talk? 
- Yes.

557
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,220
What kind of a talk is that?

558
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,500
Son, I should have 
had this talk 12 years ago.

559
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,780
I am a little late, 
but better late than never.

560
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,900
What are you talking about?

561
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,420
Look son, I was 24 when I got married.

562
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,980
Before that, I used to go 
for strolls in the neighbourhood.

563
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,460
You will soon turn 31.

564
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,740
Your body is filled 
with.. what is it called?

565
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
Tes..

566
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,620
Give me a minute. I forgot.

567
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,820
I had memorised everything, 
but I forgot. Wait.

568
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,380
Tes-tos-terone.

569
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,100
Yes. There are a few elements..

570
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,260
- Papa, please, I know. 
- I know that you know.

571
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,900
But you don't know that when 
their numbers start increasing..

572
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,540
..you feel a strange fire. Yes.

573
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,940
- Fire? 
- Yes.

574
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,980
Are you feeling alright?

575
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,700
Why are you saying 
such strange things?

576
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,900
This isn't strange. 
This is correct education.

577
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,540
It is because of this that you 
wanted to crack open Goldie's skull.

578
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,420
Papa, stop this.

579
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,340
You know how worried 
we are because of you?

580
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,020
You scared us yesterday. We 
thought you'd do some serious damage.

581
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,540
- What have I damaged? 
- No, you haven't.

582
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,300
You actually cannot.

583
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,700
But you will be forced by them to.

584
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,740
- Yes. 
- Who them?

585
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,980
The testo-tentrone.

586
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,700
- What testentrone? 
- The testentron..

587
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,500
Whatever it's called. 
Show me your phone.

588
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,820
Wait.

589
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,180
Where is it?

590
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,580
Here it is. Have a look.

591
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,860
- Tinder? 
- Yes, Tinder.

592
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,740
Learn to take full 
advantage of technology.

593
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,860
30-year-old virgin boy orders 
Gulab Jamun (sweets) online.

594
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,300
I am not a virgin. 
You can have it checked if you want.

595
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,660
Have it checked, yeah right!

596
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,860
I am your father. I know everything.

597
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,740
Mummy!

598
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,100
Are you crazy?

599
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,500
Oh man, they are all going crazy.

600
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,460
Raj, any other place?

601
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,100
Perhaps where your friend, 
brother, cousin fell in love?

602
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,780
In office.

603
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,220
- In office? 
- Yes.

604
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,420
Sir, maximum number of my 
friends fell in love in office.

605
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,780
You work together, you talk, 
you mingle. That's it.

606
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,660
There are so many 
female teachers here..

607
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,940
..but all the male 
teachers are dumbos.

608
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,260
College closes at four.

609
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,420
You can easily go out for tea, 
coffee or a movie and get the girl.

610
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,180
- Really? 
- Yes.

611
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,900
So guys, you need to understand that 
law of diminishing marginal utility..

612
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,340
..is the most important 
law of business.

613
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,540
You guys didn't 
understand the concept?

614
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,740
What is so difficult 
about this concept?

615
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,420
It's the simplest law of economics.

616
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,860
I'll give a test on this 
concept tomorrow, alright?

617
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,620
Are you guys ready for that?

618
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,620
You don't understand..

619
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,060
- Madam. 
- Thank you.

620
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,500
Sir..

621
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,940
They call this leave encashment?

622
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,060
I wonder when this 
probation period will end.

623
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,460
Don't stress over it. 
It will end soon.

624
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,540
If it doesn't happen soon, 
I'll get married.

625
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,100
I'm soon going to turn 30. 
I have waited enough.

626
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,940
Madam! 
Ekta, what are you doing this evening?

627
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
After college?

628
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,740
Nothing. I'll be going home.

629
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,420
I was wondering, 
can we go out for a cup of coffee?

630
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,620
Yes, I heard the canteen 
guy brought a new coffee machine.

631
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,980
- He did? 
- Yes.

632
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,500
No I meant, 
can we go out in the evening?

633
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,700
For a movie, for dinner?

634
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,900
If you're free.

635
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,220
Sir, I already have a 
plan tonight with my boyfriend.

636
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,620
Not a problem. Next time.

637
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,460
Okay.

638
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,700
Renu madam, 
what time is the staff meeting?

639
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,100
- At 3:00 p.m. sir. 
- At three?

640
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,460
They have a meeting every 
week for no reason at all.

641
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,500
I was wondering, 
can we go out in the evening?

642
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,980
Maybe to Cannaught Place?

643
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,620
Not possible, sir.

644
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,500
Someone's coming over to see me today.

645
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,940
So you know, I'll have 
to make arrangements and stuff.

646
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
I know.

647
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,340
Is it confirmed?

648
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,620
Yes.

649
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,860
Are you coming along?

650
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,940
No, you go ahead. I have some work.

651
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,620
Okay. See you.

652
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,660
Did you get the lecture 
schedule for the second year?

653
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,900
No, I already enquired.

654
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,340
- Late as usual. 
- Right.

655
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,620
The new English teacher.

656
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,540
- He is so handsome. 
- Indeed.

657
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,940
"Everyone is awed at the sight"

658
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,520
"This moon shines bright"

659
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,490
500, 1000.. 
Keep it down.

660
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,490
500, 1000, 1500.. 
Around 4000 I think.

661
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,570
You'll need 4000 grafts.

662
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,410
- Grafts? 
- Yes.

663
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,170
- Hair roots. 
- Whose hair?

664
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,090
Yours, of course.

665
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,010
Don't worry, 
we'll collect from behind.

666
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,610
Behind where?

667
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,090
The back of your head.

668
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:41,490
If we still fall short, we'll take 
more from your beard, chest, armpits..

669
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,410
Don't worry, we will manage.

670
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,010
This is quite complicated.

671
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,730
It only sounds complicated.

672
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,930
It's quite easy. I do it every day.

673
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,170
It's quite simple.

674
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,090
Don't look up there.

675
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,330
I lost them after I turned 45.

676
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,050
Young guys like you need hair.

677
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,970
No hair, no girl.

678
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,250
It's 150 per graft, 
so it comes to around 600,000 rupees.

679
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,810
600,000!

680
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,250
Doctor, this isn't cancer 
that I'd spend so much.

681
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,570
I'm on a tight budget.

682
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:21,050
We'll get you a loan.

683
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,610
You can pay in 12 easy instalments.

684
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,770
It'll be 60,000 per month.

685
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,490
That's almost my monthly salary.

686
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,850
How about something cheaper?

687
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,490
I'll prescribe some pills then.

688
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,050
You'll have to have them lifelong.

689
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,490
Is it safe?

690
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,090
Almost.

691
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:45,970
One out of every 200 might 
get partial or full impotency.

692
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,250
Side effect.

693
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,210
My odds have always been bad.

694
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,530
Any other option?

695
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,130
Then..

696
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,170
There is just one option left.

697
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,530
What?

698
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,730
"You shouldn't hide your beauty, 
my love"

699
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,250
"You shouldn't hide your beauty, 
my love"

700
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,730
"You shouldn't make 
the boys suffer, my love"

701
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:39,730
"You will have to 
pick someone eventually"

702
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:43,210
"Pray, will you marry me?"

703
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,930
Dharam, recite the poem.

704
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,970
"The desire for revolution 
lies in our hearts"

705
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,170
"Let us see what strength 
lies in the executioner's arms"

00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,210
"When the time comes, 
we shall show thee, O heaven"

708
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,370

what lurks in our hearts?"

710
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,330
What a relief.

711
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:29,170
Sir, I just wanted to say you 
shouldn't take this to your heart.

712
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,810
These idle hooligans 
have nothing else to do.

713
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,690
Take care of yourself.

714
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,490
And don't stress over this.

715
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,890
Okay? I'll leave.

716
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,770
Bye, sir. Take care.

717
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,440
Hi sir, are you okay?

718
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,530
Take care of yourself.

719
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,660
Oh Chaman Kohli.

720
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,310
Hi! I'm fine. Thank you.

721
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,010
Hi, sir.

722
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,250
Hi.

723
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,170
Sir, should I address 
you as sir or as Chaman?

724
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,330
No, I'll call you Chomu.

725
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,690
What is it?

726
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,530
You are a first year student, right?

727
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,850
- Yes. 
- What if someone sees us together?

728
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,810
Oh come on, Chomu! Can't 
a professor and a student be friends?

729
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,890
Anyway, I don't think 
that you are too old.

730
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,010
How old are you?

731
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,250
- 30. 
- 30?

732
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,570
I'm 20.

733
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,890
Close enough.

734
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,250
Let's go.

735
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,330
- Come on! 
- Okay.

736
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,410
You know our college's crowd.

737
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,050
All the boys are so creepy.

738
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,850
I like sensible, mature men.

739
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,610
You don't need to wear a wig.

740
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,250
You look good just the way you are.

741
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,930
You look like 'The Rock'!

742
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,410
Yes.

743
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,010
"Bowled over.."

744
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,570
"My heart's lost to you"

745
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:17,450
"A look, and I fell 
head over heels for you"

746
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,570
"So beautiful and well bloomed"

747
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,410
"Have come directly from the moon?"

748
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,530
"So beautiful and well bloomed"

749
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,050
"Have come directly from the moon?"

750
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,250
"Sometimes you seem 
too good to be true"

751
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:36,370
"Twinkle-twinkle, 
my eyes sparkle when they see you"

752
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:42,410
"Twinkle-twinkle, my eyes.."

753
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:48,370
"Twinkle-twinkle, 
my eyes sparkle when they see you"

754
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:54,650
"Twinkle-twinkle, my eyes.."

755
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,250
You know I am only one who 
is still single in my friend circle?

756
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,530
Don't worry.

757
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,730
Everyone finds someone. 
Nandu did too.

758
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,530
- Nandu who? 
- My driver.

759
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:17,970
Right.

760
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,010
It's too early for you to 
even think about marriage, right?

761
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,570
Hello! Who says so?

762
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,370
My mom was 17 when she got married.

763
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,690
Therefore, 
I am already three years late.

764
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,290
You are still in the first year.

765
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,530
So?

766
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,290
Does the college 
expel married students?

767
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,650
My mother completed her 
graduation after marriage.

768
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,490
- "Oh my love, my dove.." 
- Really?

769
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,570
"Your eyes have me floored"

770
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,330
"Oh my agile butterfly.."

771
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,410
"For you my heart soars"

772
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,450
"We are meant to be together, 
that's my only respite"

773
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,410
"I feel fortunate 
to have you in my life"

774
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,410
"We are meant to be together, 
that's my only respite"

775
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,450
"I feel fortunate 
to have you in my life"

776
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,090
"So beautiful and well bloomed"

777
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,330
"Have come directly from the moon?"

778
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,970
"So beautiful and well bloomed"

779
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,490
"Have come directly from the moon?"

780
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,730
"Sometimes you seem 
too good to be true"

781
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:22,770
"Twinkle-twinkle, 
my eyes sparkle when they see you"

782
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:28,770
"Twinkle-twinkle, my eyes.."

783
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:34,850
"Twinkle-twinkle, 
my eyes sparkle when they see you"

784
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:41,170
"Twinkle-twinkle, my eyes.."

785
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,370
'Tara?'

786
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,010
'Madamji.'

787
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:55,890
'She is a Muslim.'

788
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,490
'She is ours to take.'

789
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,810
'No one will touch her.'

790
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,810
'We do all the hard work 
and you want to keep the spoils?'

791
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,810
- 'Move aside. 
- Like I said, if..'

792
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,170
Chaman.

793
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:09,530
I was wondering..

794
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:14,250
..should we delete 
your profile in shaadi.com?

795
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,570
You have already found a girl.

796
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,970
We know. 
Goldie saw you two together.

797
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,650
Why don't you tell us who she is?

798
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,570
Tell us who she is.

799
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,050
Is she even for real?

800
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,290
She is!

801
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,490
Now just don't shooting 
questions at me.

802
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,850
"Who she is? 
What does she do? What's her name?"

803
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,210
"What's her caste? What do 
her parents do? How old is she?"

804
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,250
Please.

805
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,650
'So, she is a Muslim?'

806
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,690
'There, now she is a Sikh.'

807
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:58,970
'If anyone even looks at her, 
I swear, I'll behead him.'

808
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,010
- What did I say wrong? 
- How would I know?

809
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,250
They are responsible for this.. 
those 'testentrone'.

810
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,530
Hi.

811
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:46,890
What's wrong?

812
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,010
All good?

813
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,610
Tests begin in four days.

814
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,130
I'm going to flunk.

815
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,650
Aaina, you didn't 
prepare for the tests?

816
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:02,210
Grandma wasn't keeping well.

817
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,530
Oh.

818
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,890
I just couldn't concentrate 
on my studies this semester.

819
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:07,930
I need to cover five 
subjects in four days.

820
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,570
Even if I do a subject a day, 
I'll have to skip one.

821
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:17,890
You are preparing the test 
questions this semester, right?

822
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:20,850
Yes.

823
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,010
Chomu..

824
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,650
If I could get a few questions..

825
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,170
No Aaina, I cannot do that.

826
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,210
I'll fail, Chomu.

827
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,570
Why do you treat 
me like other students?

828
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,890
Am I not special to you?

829
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:43,290
You are very special.

830
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:46,930
But.. I cannot leak 
the question paper.

831
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,490
Let me teach you.

832
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,170
There is no time.

833
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,570
There is a lot of time.

834
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,570
No, there isn't.

835
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,770
Just give me the five 
important questions.

836
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,330
The test only has five questions.

837
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:01,650
Oh.

838
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,010
Then give me 10. 
I'll be prepared, I promise.

839
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,090
- Aaina.. 
- Please, Chomu.

840
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,250
Please let me know.

841
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,330
Please. Please let me know.

842
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,770
Would you want me to flunk the tests?

843
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,490
No?

844
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:18,410
Please?

845
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,090
Chomu, please? 
Please let me know.

846
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,330
Look into your own paper.

847
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,250
Sister-in-law's cheating!

848
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,890
Silence!

849
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,010
Nobody will talk.

850
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,330
If anybody talks..

851
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,530
..that body, another body, 
both the bodies will be thrown out.

852
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:22,650
Sir.

853
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:23,730
Done.

854
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,490
Thanks, Choms.

Good afternoon, sir.

858
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,130
Good afternoon.

860
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,010

I need to get home.

873
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,730
[reciting poem]

874
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,810
Professor's on Tinder!

875
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,010
Professor is a womaniser! 
Professor is a womaniser!

876
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,330
Professor's on Tinder!

877
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,410
- Hello? 
- Hello?

878
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:12,330
Where are you? 
Where have you reached?

879
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,170
- I can't locate you. 
- I have reached.

880
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,770
Where are you exactly?

881
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,530
Under the dome.

882
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,730
There are a lot of domes here. 
Which one?

883
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:24,330
Under the big dome.

884
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,850
No, I still can't locate you.

885
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:32,570
There's a bald guy standing there 
wearing a white shirt with black pants.

886
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,010
Where exactly are you?

887
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,040
Sorry, I couldn't make 
out from the picture posted.

888
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,360
'I wouldn't have showed up 
if he had posted a full body shot.'

889
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,050
'Like I would have if I'd 
seen the buffalo that you are.'

890
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,960
'Fat people should compulsorily 
post a full body shot.'

891
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,480
You too shouldn't have 
posted a close up picture..

892
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,520
So, what brought you to Tinder?

893
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,360
I mean, did you want 
a girlfriend or a hook-up?

894
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,160
A wife.

895
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,440
'Is he insane?'

896
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,200
'Who goes hunting for a wife on Tinder?'

897
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,280
Why are you on Tinder?

898
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,400
Well, I just had a breakup 
so I thought about checking it out.

899
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,480
Perhaps, I might find someone.

900
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,680
Perhaps, I might end up liking someone.

901
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,960
Why Tinder?

902
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,400
Why not try the traditional route?

903
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,440
'You are an oldie!' 
'Your son is an oldie and a baldie!'

904
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,160
I tried, but I didn't like any.

905
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
There is a shortage 
of good girls these days.

906
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,280
I am not someone who compromises.

907
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,810
'You won't compromise?'

908
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,890
'You are a compromise.'

909
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,170
They are not that hard to find.

910
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:05,730
Why did you breakup?

911
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,170
I wanted to say something.

912
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,330
Go ahead.

913
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,140
Sandy's birthday party.. - It was fun!

914
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,020
Your family is so sweet.

915
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,420
Your mummy, papa, uncles and aunts..

916
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,300
First, I was in love with you. 
Now, I am in love with your family.

917
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,780
So my family..

918
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,100
Agreed to get us married?

919
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,580
No.

920
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,340
They aren't happy 
about this relationship.

921
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,420
They said..

922
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,340
..we don't make a good couple.

923
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,780
You look elder than me.

924
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,260
You are a little.. not little, 
too much on the heavier side?

925
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,420
That's why I keep asking 
you to gain some weight.

926
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,940
You are so lanky.

927
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,500
Start having a couple 
of bananas every day.

928
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,340
And assorted breads with 
loads of butter on them.

929
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,060
And please don't cook 
them in olive oil and stuff..

930
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,340
Oh please.

931
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,260
I am not lanky, you are fat.

932
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,060
My parents don't want 
their daughter-in-law to be..

933
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,820
Before we end up getting more hurt..

934
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,980
Let's breakup now.

935
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,110
Excuse me ma'am.

936
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,460
Excuse me, 
could you box this pastry up for me?

937
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,940
Why did you breakup?

938
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,020
Well.. it just didn't work out.

939
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,660
He was too dumb.

940
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,220
His brains were stuck here.

941
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,700
He used to have 50 boiled eggs in a day.

942
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,980
I wonder where they all went. 
He didn't have a good body.

943
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,180
Anyways, what do you teach?

944
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,340
Hindi.

945
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,460
Hindi?

946
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,700
It must be quite a boring job, 
I mean, being a Hindi lecturer?

947
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,780
Boring?

948
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,540
It's boring to be a lecturer?

949
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,140
Hindi.

950
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,860
What's wrong with teaching Hindi?

951
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,100
What do you do?

952
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,340
I'm a bridal makeup artist.

953
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,460
But I have taken a break, 
so I am at home these days.

954
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,220
It's boring to stay at home.

955
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,020
It's not boring to be a Hindi lecturer.

956
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,860
'He's such a grouch.'

957
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,780
'I don't want to date this baldie.'

958
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,380
'This fatso is so crude.'

959
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,540
'I wouldn't marry her even if 
she is the last girl left in the world.'

960
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,780
'How do I say no to him?'

961
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,500
'How do I get out of here?'

962
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,100
We can be friends.

963
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:43,980
Yes!

964
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,420
Right! 
Good friends.

965
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,580
Great friends.

966
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,980
I'll call you.

967
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,220
I'll drop in a message on Facebook.

968
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,060
Okay.

969
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,660
- Bye. 
- Bye.

970
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,780
Auto.

971
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:07,800
- Mayur Vihar? 
- No.

972
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,940
Can I drop you somewhere?

973
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,940
Could you drop me to the Metro Station?

974
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,220
Fine.

975
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,540
Hold on.

976
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,740
- Ready? 
- Yes.

977
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,420
- She is badly hurt. 
- Bed six, bed six.

978
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,900
- Where is he? - There. 
- Chaman.

979
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,700
Oh my God, what happened?

980
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,020
Are you alright?

981
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,140
- I've just sprained my wrist a little. 
- Your pants are torn.

982
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,780
Everything else is fine?

983
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,620
Yes.

984
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,620
Hello.

985
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,780
I'm Apsara's dad.

986
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,140
Apsara's mom.

987
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,660
They were together 
when they had an accident.

988
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:43,940
Meaning?

989
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,300
They were together.

990
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:46,940
Oh.

991
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,140
- Hello. 
- Hello.

992
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,380
I'm his mother.

993
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,700
His father.

994
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,660
- Hello, sister. 
- Hello.

995
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,700
- Hello, auntie. Hello, uncle. 
- Hello dear.

996
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,500
Oh no.

997
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,460
This looks bad.

998
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,380
No, it's just ligament tear.

999
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,020
How did this happen?

1000
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,260
Well, he lost the balance of the scooter.

1001
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,660
Chaman never drives it well.

1002
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,380
He almost made me fall a couple of times.

1003
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,380
- I drive carefully. 
- Shut up.

1004
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,620
'Take a good look at her.'

1005
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,060
'What makes you think 
she can ride pillion?'

1006
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,700
It's your fault.

1007
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,380
I've told you a thousand 
times to let Chaman take the car.

1008
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,700
He has a social life. 
He'll make good use of the car.

1009
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,060
So, when are they getting discharged?

1010
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,380
He's getting discharged today.

1011
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,260
They will keep Apsara 
under observation for a day.

1012
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:42,940
Wait.

1013
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,780
- Chaman will stay here with her. 
- Yes.

1014
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:46,540
What?

1015
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,420
No sister, I'm here for her.

1016
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,380
No, sister. 
He is the one who caused this.

1017
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,940
- So, he's the one who will 
look after her. - Yes.

1018
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:56,620
- No, I mean we cannot 
give him the trouble. - Yes.

1019
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,180
- No. 
- No, it's no trouble.

1020
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,780
It's better to have a man 
to do the running around if required.

1021
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,980
- Yes. - You'll stay. 
Do you understand?

1022
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,660
Sir, please clear the bill.

1023
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,540
- Okay. 
- Let's go.

1024
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,020
- Should I come along? 
- Yes.

1025
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:07,980
I'll be right back.

1026
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,460
- Let's go, sister. 
- Come on.

1027
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,140
Thank God are kids are fine.

1028
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,020
Yes, sister.

1029
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,260
And look at how God 
conspired to get us together.

1030
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,140
- I swear. 
- Yes.

1031
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,420
Kids these days don't 
tell their parents anything.

1032
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,060
- Chaman had given us a hint. 
- Okay.

1033
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,660
- But he didn't give 
us any details. - Okay.

1034
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:24,780
- He is shy that way. 
- I see.

1035
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,220
- No.. 
- No need, Mr. Kohli.

1036
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:31,220
Don't embarrass me like this.

1037
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,820
- No way. I have change. 
- Same here.

1038
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,940
During the phase of demonetisation, 
you need..

1039
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,580
- No, please. 
- You can ask Ms. Shweta here.

1040
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,220
- We are frequent this place. 
- Please let me clear the bill.

1041
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,860
We are regulars here.

1042
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,340
Please let me clear the bill.

1043
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,140
- I'm begging you. 
- Please don't do that.

1044
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,620
That's so unfair. Please don't do this.

1045
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,340
Chaman caused that fall 
so he should pay the bill.

1046
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,780
Let's spilt the bill then.

1047
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,220
Let me contribute a little. Here.

1048
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,460
- Here. 
- Here you go.

1049
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,140
We are done. 
What are you doing?

1050
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:55,980
Take this back.

1051
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,380
Thank God that your daughter is healthy.

1052
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,940
You know I too fell over once.

1053
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:04,180
Doctor said my bones didn't 
break because of my body fat.

1054
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,620
Well, Apsara has a slow metabolism.

1055
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:08,780
Slow what?

1056
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:13,460
The way her bodies processes 
the food she eats is a little off.

1057
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,900
- Okay. 
- She eats less than us.

1058
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,060
Tell me, who eats just 
two Parathas (stuffed bread)?

1059
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,100
No one.

1060
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,060
That's my weak spot as well.

1061
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:22,780
Really?

1062
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,420
I faced the same problem 
just day before yesterday.

1063
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,820
I made four Parathas.

1064
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:26,860
Cauliflower is in season these days.

1065
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,620
So I thought why not eat them. 
They taste so good.

1066
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,140
Chaman's father just 
wouldn't stop taunting me.

1067
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,340
I ended up having just three of them.

1068
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,260
I don't eat much, you see.

1069
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,100
- Really? 
- True.

1070
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:41,780
Mummy?

1071
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,300
Mummy?

1072
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,380
Mummy?

1073
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,060
What happened?

1074
01:01:59,020 --> 01:01:59,940
Where's my mom?

1075
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,340
She's asleep.

1076
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,620
Do you want anything?

1077
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,180
Well, actually..

1078
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,220
Chaman.

1079
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,860
I'm hungry.

1080
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,340
I'll go get something.

1081
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,980
Can I come with you?

1082
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,540
I'm bored.

1083
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,660
Doesn't your leg hurt?

1084
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:31,940
Please.

1085
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,540
I know this is stupid, 
but I am having a lot of fun.

1086
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,880
Of course, I am doing all the hard work.

1087
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,970
You are doing exercise.

1088
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,300
Why are you so happy?

1089
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,900
Five year ago, 
in the last year of graduation..

1090
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,340
..I had sneaked out just 
like this to have noodles.

1091
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:55,260
It was the last exam so all my friends 
had come to the hostel for group study.

1092
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,260
The only difference was 
that we had booze instead of this.

1093
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,260
A night before the exam?

1094
01:02:59,340 --> 01:02:59,900
Yes.

1095
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,700
It was the last day of college. 
That's the least we could do.

1096
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,500
Actually, 
this is my first hospitalisation.

1097
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,220
Have you ever been hospitalised?

1098
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:08,780
No.

1099
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,420
New experience.

1100
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,740
New experience?

1101
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,300
Be grateful, it wasn't anything serious.

1102
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,980
There is always a reason 
behind everything in life.

1103
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:20,060
There is always something good in it, 
we just don't see it.

1104
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,660
What can be good in an accident?

1105
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,060
We will learn that later.

1106
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,460
Like if not for the accident..

1107
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:28,140
..we wouldn't be having noodles 
and tea in the middle of the night.

1108
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,100
Talking like this.

1109
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,580
We wouldn't have experienced 
the wheelchair ride.

1110
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:32,820
True.

1111
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,180
Tell me something.

1112
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,820
Why an arranged marriage?

1113
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,940
You don't have a girlfriend?

1114
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,580
You have never been in a relationship?

1115
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,700
I was.

1116
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,740
I have been in many relationships.

1117
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,580
In school, in college.

1118
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,540
Even until recently.

1119
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,540
I just had a breakup.

1120
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,700
And why did it happen?

1121
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,140
She was a 20-year-old kid.

1122
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:56,980
Immature.

1123
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,740
She had no brains.

1124
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,740
She was a headache.

1125
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,620
And.. 
You don't compromise.

1126
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:04,660
I know.

1127
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,780
Anyway, look for someone 
close to your age to get married.

1128
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:10,940
Yes.

1129
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,900
And you won't find such girls on Tinder.

1130
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,460
You'll have to opt for 
a marriage bureau or shaadi.com.

1131
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,700
So please go there.

1132
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,260
I know where and how to find a girl.

1133
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,940
You don't need to tell me.

1134
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,300
Don't get upset, I was just joking.

1135
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:24,980
Chill.

1136
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,060
Shall we leave?

1137
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,260
Let's go.

1138
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,180
By the way, thank you.

1139
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,660
Thank you for the tea, 
noodles and..

1140
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,660
The wheelchair ride.

1141
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,260
Good night.

1142
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,220
Good night.

1143
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,660
I feel cheated, Raj.

1144
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,140
Everything's fake on the internet.

1145
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:03,380
What you see is not what you get.

1146
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:06,060
I gave her a lift and 
we met with an accident.

1147
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,580
Our parents ended up meeting each other.

1148
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:10,460
They were talking to each other 
like they were long lost relatives.

1149
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,380
I spent the whole night 
in the hospital for no reason.

1150
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,260
You spent the night in the hospital?

1151
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:16,860
- Yes. 
- Then what happened?

1152
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,140
Then what? 
Dawn came and I escaped.

1153
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,500
I'll talk to you later.

1154
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,220
- I'm getting late for my class. 
- Okay, sir.

1155
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:29,540
This is how it is supposed to be. 
Kids should do whatever they please.

1156
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,140
Right.

1157
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,980
Chaman is a very decent 
and a well-cultured boy.

1158
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:33,420
Okay.

1159
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:36,700
He doesn't have girlfriends. 
He doesn't like to loiter around.

1160
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,060
He's a very "pure".

1161
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:42,100
Very pure. 
Just like Ghee (Clarified butter).

1162
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:42,740
Yes.

1163
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:43,820
There he is.

1164
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,020
Come here, son.

1165
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,220
- Hello. 
- Hello.

1166
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,340
We were just talking about you.

1167
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:49,780
- Yes. 
- Come and sit with us.

1168
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,380
No, I am fine.

1169
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,700
It's not fine. Come here.

1170
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,820
Come on, come and sit with us.

1171
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,100
How are you doing, son?

1172
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,460
How are you feeling now?

1173
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,580
Good.

1174
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,460
Thank God.

1175
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,780
- Mr. Kohli? 
- Yes.

1176
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,180
- He looks "pure". 
- Right.

1177
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:08,140
Absolutely.

1178
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,300
It's so hard to find 
such "pure" boys these days.

1179
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,420
Boys are such creeps these days.

1180
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,460
My son has always respected girls.

1181
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,620
That's why he is "pure".

1182
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,820
- He doesn't drink or smoke either. 
- Right.

1183
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:24,380
We have no issues with that.

1184
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,540
- Really? 
- We too sometimes..

1185
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:28,540
Really?

1186
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,540
Mr. Batra, why didn't you tell me? 
I would have got some for you.

1187
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,540
- What would you have? 
- No, thanks.

1188
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,700
It will be here in no time. 
It won't be a problem.

1189
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,300
We'll share a drink or two. 
What do you say?

1190
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,860
Come on, don't force him.

1191
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,260
He must not be in mood for it.

1192
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,300
Some other time then. 
We'll be getting together often now.

1193
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,140
Right.

1194
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,220
Okay then, we'll take your leave now.

1195
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,500
- How about another round of tea? 
- No, thank you.

1196
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,260
- Bye. 
- Bye.

1197
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,700
That's okay.

1198
01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:57,980
"Pure" boy.

1199
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,380
It is not so, papa.

1200
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,020
We are just friends.

1201
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,740
That's good, dear.

1202
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,620
Friends make good husbands.

1203
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,700
Look at our friendship for example.

1204
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:10,420
Right?

1205
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,820
- Here. 
- Cheers.

1206
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,380
I agree he doesn't have 
much hair but he is a nice boy.

1207
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,780
It's not that, mummy.

1208
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,100
I know he is a Hindi professor. 
It's a little boring.

1209
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,100
But it is a government job.

1210
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,140
And she knows how to 
keep herself entertained.

1211
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,300
The important thing 
is that he is a nice boy.

1212
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,140
Yes.

1213
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,780
It is not so.

1214
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:35,260
The thing is, 
he isn't a loafer like the other boys.

1215
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,580
He is a decent boy.

1216
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,620
A "pure" guy.

1217
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:39,820
A "pure" boy.

1218
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:44,020
One look at him and 
I knew that he is "pure".

1219
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,020
Tell me something, 
how did all this started?

1220
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,020
We were just having a conversation 
and they brought up the marriage topic.

1221
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,060
Apsara, you are 29 years old.

1222
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,900
How much longer do you want to wait?

1223
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,900
Look, dear..

1224
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,300
Only if you feel like it..

1225
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,660
If you like him..

1226
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:05,660
If you think he is genuine..

1227
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,620
Then we will go forward.

1228
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:09,980
Right?

1229
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,340
Chaman likes me?

1230
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,300
- Yes! 
- Yes!

1231
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,100
That's why his parents 
brought up the marriage topic.

1232
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,500
Who brought up this topic? 
I don't want to get married.

1233
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,940
Open the door! I said open it!

1234
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:23,580
Strange.

1235
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,940
Not so long ago he said 
he found a girl and what not.

1236
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:29,060
I just don't understand.

1237
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,260
She is so fat.

1238
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,220
She won't look good with me.

1239
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,700
She isn't fat. 
Her metal-ball..

1240
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,700
Something is off balanced.

1241
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,820
He will go around with fat 
girls but we won't marry them!

1242
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,700
She isn't fat, she is healthy.

1243
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,500
- Like you. 
- Right.

1244
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,980
That's how Punjabi girls are.

1245
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,820
She is not like those matchstick 
thin South Delhi girls..

1246
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,420
..who get drunk on empty 
stomach and then puck their guts out.

1247
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,780
Have you taken a good look at her?

1248
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,140
Have you seen yourself?

1249
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,660
You think you are Tom Cruise?

1250
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,900
This isn't my fault.

1251
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,180
It's grandpa's fault.

1252
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:59,100
The one you worship every morning. 
He is behind this.

1253
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,020
I inherited baldness from him.

1254
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,300
How did you get it from him?

1255
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,580
How?

1256
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,340
It's because of the genes, mummy.

1257
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:06,260
You won't understand.

1258
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:10,820
And why don't I have this hair.. 
heredity?

1259
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,380
Right.

1260
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,540
- Why doesn't Goldie have it? 
- Right.

1261
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,580
You guys are lucky.

1262
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,860
These genes went dormant 
for you and Goldie.

1263
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,020
That's why they didn't 
have any effect on you two.

1264
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,500
I had to suffer all its ill effects.

1265
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:21,540
Oh great! It's not like 
I forced these genes on you.

1266
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,620
Strange fellow.

1267
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,380
God decides what you 
get and what you don't get.

1268
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:28,620
What should I do? 
I have no feelings for her.

1269
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,980
Listen son..

1270
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,820
There is a right time for everything.

1271
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,140
You will start getting these 
feelings after you get married.

1272
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,340
Get this straight!

1273
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,700
You are not in a position to 
choose a girl based on your feelings!

1274
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,860
Try to understand. 
You'll be single all your life otherwise.

1275
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:44,780
You'll be banging your head 
on walls in a couple of years.

1276
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,860
You will die a virgin! 
A virgin!

1277
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:47,700
Die what?

1278
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,460
Forget it.

1279
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:53,220
One more thing, 
all these praises are a lie.

1280
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,380
30-year-old guy, and "pure"?

1281
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,140
This is not something to boast about.

1282
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,260
It is!

1283
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,580
My son is "pure". Chaste!

1284
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,980
I am not "pure". 
You can have it checked.

1285
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:04,700
Right!

1286
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:07,300
I am your father. I know everything.

1287
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,700
Please don't put so 
much pressurise on my head.

1288
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,700
You are under pressure 
because of your head, son.

1289
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,140
Why don't you get it?

1290
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,100
We have been getting 
humiliated since five years.

1291
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,780
So many families have rejected you.

1292
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:23,740
We cannot take this anymore.

1293
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,940
We are tired.

1294
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:28,860
Guddi, talk to him.

1295
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:36,580
Look son, 
you will turn 31 in four months.

1296
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,300
Think about it.

1297
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,500
I know my son will 
make the right decision.

1298
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,670
[I think we can be good friends]

1299
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,770
[But we aren't compatible for marriage]

1300
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,900
[Can we meet tomorrow evening? 
I need to talk to you]

1301
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:21,530
[No]

1302
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,290
[Okay]

1303
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,900
We can be good friends.

1304
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,140
We aren't compatible for marriage.

1305
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,700
We can be good friends.

1306
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,580
Hi.

1307
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:47,180
Hi.

1308
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:48,980
How are you?

1309
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:49,860
Good.

1310
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,420
How's your hand?

1311
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,500
How's your leg?

1312
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,740
It's almost healed.

1313
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,950
They'll take off the 
bandage in a couple of days.

1314
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,580
- Well.. 
- Chaman, I wanted to say something.

1315
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,620
My ex-boyfriend Mohit..

1316
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:16,920
Actually, he dumped me and 
it wasn't the other way around.

1317
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,100
He kept using the 
excuse of compatibility.

1318
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,740
But he finally said the 
truth while breaking up with me.

1319
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:30,300
He and his family had a 
problem with me being overweight.

1320
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:38,380
They said he is their only son 
so they wanted an angelic wife for him.

1321
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:44,620
I did the same thing with 
you during our first meeting.

1322
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,260
I judged you for your looks.

1323
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,420
So, you are rejecting me?

1324
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:50,780
No.

1325
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,500
That accident was destiny.

1326
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:59,620
If not for that, 
we wouldn't have met again.

1327
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,700
Our families wouldn't have met.

1328
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:05,740
And I wouldn't have been 
able to see your inner beauty.

1329
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,220
'Inner beauty?'

1330
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:13,180
And perhaps, you and your family 
wouldn't be able to see my inner beauty.

1331
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,580
'What inner beauty?'

1332
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:19,460
Chaman, somewhere.. somewhere I like you.

1333
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,500
I think if our families get along..

1334
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:27,020
..so well then we too 
can consider getting married.

1335
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,830
Do you have something to say?

1336
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:35,840
No.

1337
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,260
Looks are superficial, Chaman.

1338
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:42,300
Everyone loses hair eventually.

1339
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,900
Everyone puts on some 
weight after marriage.

1340
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,740
If it has to happen eventually 
then why not accept it?

1341
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,260
You are very nice.

1342
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,620
Everyone on Tinder is only 
looking for a one-night stand.

1343
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,940
But you can meet on 
Tinder and fall in love.

1344
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,020
You can get married too.

1345
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,460
Well, I have deleted 
the app from my phone.

1346
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,540
You too should delete it.

1347
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,310
Why don't you just say no to her?

1348
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,030
I am not in a position to refuse, Raj.

1349
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,870
My family is tired. 
And what reason would I give them?

1350
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,390
I have no other option.

1351
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,910
If not for that accident, 
all this wouldn't have happened.

1352
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,190
Why don't you talk to the girl? 
Perhaps, she'd agree with you.

1353
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,750
I'd gone to talk to her.

1354
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:33,790
She told me the sob 
story about her breakup.

1355
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,230
What would have I told her anyway?

1356
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,590
That she is fat.. and 
that's why I cannot marry her?

1357
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,910
They are about to match our horoscopes.

1358
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,030
That's how serious things are now.

1359
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:53,630
What?

1360
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:57,510
Huh?

1361
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:06,030
Guruji, my parents want 
me to marry a girl I don't like.

1362
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,870
They will come here tomorrow 
to match our horoscopes.

1363
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,750
If you could find 
compatibly issues then..

1364
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:18,990
Then?

1365
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,510
I can pay you 5000.

1366
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,310
You think these horoscopes..

1367
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:35,470
planetary positions, astrology..

1368
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,510
..are a joke, right?

1369
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,510
Do you?

1370
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:42,070
No.

1371
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:44,550
Then what are you asking me to do?

1372
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:50,350
I should change the planetary positions 
just because you're paying me 5000?

1373
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,630
Huh?

1374
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:54,230
Are you asking me to lie? 
Do you have any faith in them?

1375
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,070
Do you have any respect for them? 
Do you believe in them?

1376
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,710
- Do you trust them? 
- I do.

1377
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,770
You are lying. 
You are a liar.

1378
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:02,390
You want me to lie for money.

1379
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:04,230
- Get out of here. 
- No.

1380
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,310
- Please. 
- I said leave! Get out!

1381
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:10,710
Nonsense.

1382
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,710
Why are you still here?

1383
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,870
Why are you crying?

1384
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,710
Everything's in your hands now.

1385
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,070
Look, nothing's in my hands. 
Stop crying.

1386
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:27,190
What.. what are you doing? 
Please don't cry.

1387
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:28,750
What is the problem?

1388
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:32,310
Neither she nor will 
I be happy after marriage.

1389
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,950
Okay.

1390
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,750
You are about to ruin two lives.

1391
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:36,550
Hey! How am I ruining them?

1392
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,710
Look son, don't behave like your mother.

1393
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:42,390
Please don't cry and listen to me.

1394
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:44,230
Okay.

1395
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:46,630
Okay tell me what I need to do.

1396
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,390
You just need to find 
incompatibility issues.

1397
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,950
I don't want to get married to her.

1398
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:53,990
Fine.

1399
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:59,390
Anyway, what's the use of a marriage 
that won't make you or that girl happy?

1400
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,230
Fine, I'll do it.

1401
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:03,590
But get this straight.

1402
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:06,150
I'll have to say there 
are issues in your horoscope.

1403
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,670
I won't do this to her.

1404
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:09,550
She is someone's daughter.

1405
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,310
How can I do that?

1406
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:12,430
I won't be able to do that.

1407
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:13,350
Okay, guruji.

1408
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,430
You can say there are 
issues in my horoscope.

1409
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:16,310
Okay.

1410
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:20,630
But make sure to create a 
doubt in her mind which scares her.

1411
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,710
Okay. 
Consider it done.

1412
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,070
- Thank you, guruji. 
- It's okay.

1413
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,830
Hey, listen..

1414
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:30,910
The..

1415
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:33,830
5000?

1416
01:17:34,270 --> 01:17:35,030
Tomorrow?

1417
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:36,990
Today.

1418
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:37,990
Okay.

1419
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,470
I mean right now.

1420
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,950
- Right now? 
- Yes.

1421
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:51,430
Can I pay less?

1422
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,950
Can I create less doubt?

1423
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:56,830
No.

1424
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,670
No. Good.

1425
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,110
Fuel?

1426
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:14,310
- Thank you, guruji. 
- It's okay.

1427
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:31,550
Well, there is an issue 
in the boy's planetary positions.

1428
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,110
Shit.

1429
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:39,070
Guruji, is it serious?

1430
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,110
Yes. No.

1431
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:42,830
I mean..

1432
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:45,070
..it is very serious.

1433
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:49,590
All the planets are in wrong place.

1434
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,670
Ma'am, let me put this in this way.

1435
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,150
If he gets married to her..

1436
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,870
..a life will be in danger

1437
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:58,950
Not your life.

1438
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,510
Her life will be in danger.

1439
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,990
So Mr. Kohli, I suggest you let her go.

1440
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:06,830
How can we let her go? 
She is like a daughter to us.

1441
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,590
That's why I am saying so. 
You should let her go.

1442
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:12,080
Guruji, there has to be a solution.

1443
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,150
There are chances that she could die.

1444
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:18,590
Guruji, life and death 
are anyway not in our hands.

1445
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:22,880
Even a few days with 
Chaman would be enough for me.

1446
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:30,030
Chaman, mummy, 
papa, they all love me a lot.

1447
01:19:30,110 --> 01:19:33,070
They perhaps love me more than I deserve.

1448
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:34,630
Wow.

1449
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,830
- Saw that? 
- I did.

1450
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,310
Can I get a better 
daughter-in-law than her?

1451
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:39,630
She is very..

1452
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,350
She is a goddess.

1453
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:44,070
Don't cry, mummy. Calm down.

1454
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,710
- Calm down, Guddi. 
- Shut up.

1455
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:48,470
Look.. Guruji, you are so knowledgeable.

1456
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,190
- That's fine. 
- We are nothing compared to you.

1457
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:52,670
Look knowledge and death are not related.

1458
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,590
No, I am sure you 
have a solution for this.

1459
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,230
- No, this.. 
- Don't cry.

1460
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:57,710
We will do whatever you ask us to do.

1461
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,510
Any kind of a benediction 
or a prayer you want.

1462
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,030
- Yoga, medication, I'm willing to 
do everything. - There is a solution.

1463
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:03,590
There is a solution.

1464
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:04,390
Please tell us.

1465
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:08,310
But you said that all 
the planets are doomed!

1466
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:09,720
Yes, they are doomed.

1467
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,590
But they can revived by 
performing a certain benediction.

1468
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:17,270
So, you have to perform a benediction 
which will cost you 21,500.

1469
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:20,230
21,500, guruji?

1470
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,710
Do you have a problem with that?

1471
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:24,390
- No. 
- Then do it.

1472
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,390
21,500, guruji? 
Can we not bring this down a little?

1473
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:28,910
Just a little, if you could?

1474
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,950
What are you doing, Mr. Kohli?

1475
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:34,390
We are trying to get your son 
married and you are bargaining with me?

1476
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:36,870
No bargaining, 
we want him to get married.

1477
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:37,990
Good.

1478
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,590
Seek his blessings, dear.

1479
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,030
- You are our saviour, guruji. 
- It's okay.

1480
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:42,870
You have saved us.

1481
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,270
Hail to thee!

1482
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,670
Seek his blessings.

1483
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:46,630
Come on, son.

1484
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,390
Bless you.

1485
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,370
Mr. Kohli..

1486
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,750
What's wrong?

1487
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:17,510
What are you doing here?

1488
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:19,550
It was quite smoky outside.

1489
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,230
Everyone was clicking pictures outside.

1490
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:25,430
We don't click a single picture together.

1491
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:31,390
Come closer.

1492
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,430
Smile.

1493
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,190
Chaman sir?

1494
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,070
I was wondering..

1495
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,750
.. how about some coffee?

1496
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:58,110
I'll ask the canteen guy to get it.

1497
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,030
No.

1498
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:03,350
I meant could we go out in the evening?

1499
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:06,030
Actually, why go out for just coffee?

1500
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,190
How about a movie followed by dinner?

1501
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,790
Why? Don't you have 
plans with your boyfriend?

1502
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,230
I just had a breakup.

1503
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:22,790
He was cheating on me.. 
with a girl from his office.

1504
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:25,070
Chaman sir..

1505
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:31,190
I have learnt that these handsome, 
good-looking boys are playboys.

1506
01:22:32,170 --> 01:22:37,150
One should get married to a sorted, 
sensible, mature man.

1507
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,150
Someone like you.

1508
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,310
You look loyal and committed.

1509
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:47,310
Ekta ma'am, congratulate him.

1510
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:48,590
Why?

1511
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,230
Did he get an increment?

1512
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:52,190
He stealthily got betrothed.

1513
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,830
He didn't even inform anyone.

1514
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:00,190
His would-be wife posted a 
picture on Facebook and tagged him.

1515
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:01,350
That's how I found out.

1516
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,630
Otherwise..

1517
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:07,950
Chaman sir looks like a 
decent man but he is very cunning..

1518
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:14,590
A perfect couple.

1519
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:17,140
A match made in heaven, huh.

1520
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:04,950
[Please delete the 
picture posted on Facebook]

1521
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:08,390
No one should be as unfortunate as I am.

1522
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:11,550
When I was single, 
no one would entertain me.

1523
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,830
Suddenly everyone is interested 
in me after that fatso entered my life.

1524
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:15,510
But sir, think about this.

1525
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:19,510
She is ready to marry you 
without worrying about her life.

1526
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,470
She is without a doubt a good girl.

1527
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:23,350
She might be a good girl 
but that doesn't work for me.

1528
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:26,910
She has announced it to the world..

1529
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,310
..by posting the picture on Facebook.

1530
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,310
Sir, why do you have 
a problem with her being fat?

1531
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,670
I have a problem because of this.

1532
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:40,230
The students..

1533
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,350
First, they used to tease 
me by calling me baldie.

1534
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,230
Now they say I'm marrying a buffalo.

1535
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:48,430
What do I do, Raj?

1536
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,510
I know I am not that handsome.

1537
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:54,630
But I always dreamed 
of having a beautiful wife.

1538
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,070
Someone I can love.

1539
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:59,330
Look at yourself. 
You have been married for seven years.

1540
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:02,150
There is so much excitement and love.

1541
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,150
You are always talking to her on phone.

1542
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,370
Why?

1543
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,270
Because you two are a perfect couple.

1544
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:10,910
Yes, sir.

1545
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:14,470
Who is it?

1546
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:16,230
My wife.

1547
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:17,830
Yes, Shanti.

1548
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:21,230
Sorry, I couldn't call, I was with sir.

1549
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:22,470
Excuse me, sir.

1550
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:24,270
Yes, yes.

1551
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,630
Okay.

1552
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:38,150
Hello?

1553
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:39,190
Sorry.

1554
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:42,150
I was applying makeup to a bride. 
My phone was on silent.

1555
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,230
I just got free. 
So..

1556
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,430
Why did you ask me to delete the photo?

1557
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:49,310
Did you read the comments?

1558
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:51,110
Yes, I did. 
So?

1559
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:53,150
Everyone's making fun of us.

1560
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,150
Please delete it.

1561
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:56,190
Everyone's making fun..?

1562
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:58,110
Who are making these comments?

1563
01:25:58,190 --> 01:25:59,430
University students.

1564
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,150
Do you know all of them?

1565
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,500
No.

1566
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:03,190
Then?

1567
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:06,510
Some random people's 
comments shouldn't affect us.

1568
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,350
Apsara, they are insulting me.

1569
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:10,110
Who is insulting..?

1570
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:14,870
Who is insulting you, Chaman?

1571
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:17,390
People will always have something to say.

1572
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:19,790
Some of it will be good 
and most of it will be bad.

1573
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:21,870
So, should we always react?

1574
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:27,150
How does it affect our lives..

1575
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:32,150
..if some random people 
pass a comment on us?

1576
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:35,150
I am only asking you to delete a photo.

1577
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,070
This isn't just about the photo, Chaman.

1578
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:44,430
What if someone tell 
you something bad about me?

1579
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,630
Will you leave me as well?

1580
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:51,510
Apsara, you don't get it.

1581
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:53,230
I teach in this college.

1582
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,790
I have to come here every day.

1583
01:26:56,590 --> 01:26:58,990
Fine, I'll delete it.

1584
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:03,750
But please Chaman, 
start ignoring these things.

1585
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:07,030
We cannot react like 
this over every little thing.

1586
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:13,430
Bye.

1587
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:14,700
Bye.

1588
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,510
Hi, sister!

1589
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:28,790
- Hello. 
- Hi.

1590
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,110
- How are you? 
- Busy shopping for the wedding, huh?

1591
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,870
- Sushma's son is getting married? 
- Come on!

1592
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,390
She doesn't know.

1593
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:38,910
Let me show you her picture on Facebook.

1594
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,990
- She is nice. 
- Yes.

1595
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:42,790
But don't you think she 
is a little on the heavier side?

1596
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:45,550
- I thought so too. 
- Same here.

1597
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:47,510
She looks elder than Chaman.

1598
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:48,590
No, sister.

1599
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,470
She isn't fat, she is healthy.

1600
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,110
She isn't like the other girls 
who are as thin as a matchstick.

1601
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:56,390
You know it later causes 
complications during pregnancy.

1602
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:57,950
What's the use of having such a body?

1603
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:00,430
You should have a body 
strong enough to bear a child.

1604
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:01,470
That is true.

1605
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:04,310
- You continue with your shopping then. 
- Okay.

1606
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:06,350
You have to come for the wedding. 
I'll call you.

1607
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:07,590
- Bye. 
- Bye.

1608
01:28:21,310 --> 01:28:25,160
[You are nice, 
but we aren't right for each other]

1609
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:28,720
[So, let's not get married]

1610
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:45,010
Hello?

1611
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:45,970
Yes?

1612
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:47,210
We are leaving.

1613
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:49,570
- Hurry up, Goldie. Put these 
things in the car. - Okay.

1614
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:51,810
No, you don't need to go. 
Take a left from Hanuman Temple.

1615
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,330
Hello, how are you?

1616
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:54,650
You are looking dashing, Mr. Kohli.

1617
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,410
- I just got it stitched. 
- Good.

1618
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:57,450
How are the preparations going on?

1619
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:59,530
- Good. They are going on well. 
- Let's go.

1620
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:04,090
Chaman, Apsara will be 
officially yours from today.

1621
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:05,210
Very good.

1622
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:06,490
- Come on. 
- Let's go.

1623
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:08,810
Hurry up. Why are you just sitting there? 
We are getting late.

1624
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:39,190
[I've been wanting to say something... 
I am not happy with this match]

1625
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:43,150
[Please don't ask me why]

1626
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,770
- Where have you reached? 
- Stop that and take these boxes.

1627
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:00,160
- Okay. 
- Hurry up.

1628
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,530
- Take them quickly. 
- Pass them on.

1629
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:04,410
- Hurry up, Mr. Kohli. 
- Hurry up, everyone.

1630
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:05,630
What hurry up?

1631
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:07,330
Aren't we going to take the 
boy who is about to get engaged along?

1632
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:08,730
I'll call him.

1633
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:10,010
Chaman!

1634
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:11,010
Chaman!

1635
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:13,250
- Calm down. Let him get ready. 
- Go and get him.

1636
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:14,690
- Let him get ready at least. 
- Yes?

1637
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,380
Why did you take a left? 
Let me talk to Minku.

1638
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:18,080
Mr. Batra is calling.

1639
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,810
Yes, Mr. Batra.

1640
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,690
Yes, we have left.

1641
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,740
What?

1642
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,210
You aren't coming?

1643
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:28,480
What are you saying, Mr. Batra?

1644
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,440
All our relatives and guests are here.

1645
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,080
What? 
No, listen to me.

1646
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,760
Did Chaman say something to her?

1647
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,340
We'll convince them if they had a fight.

1648
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,600
It is not so? 
Then?

1649
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,320
What?

1650
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,660
She isn't sure?

1651
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,680
Mr. Batra, please listen...

1652
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:49,280
He disconnected the call. Strange.

1653
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,400
At the last moment, he is saying that..

1654
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,320
..they aren't going 
ahead with the engagement.

1655
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,840
Apsara refused to get engaged. 
She says she isn't sure about Chaman.

1656
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:55,760
- Apsara isn't sure? 
- Yes.

1657
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,200
You should have pressed him for details.

1658
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,560
There was a lot of 
noise in the background.

1659
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,800
He isn't answering the call.

1660
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,760
- He disconnected it. 
- Give me the phone for just a second.

1661
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,080
- Come on! 
- Let me call Apsara.

1662
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,280
- Let me talk. 
- Keep quiet for a minute.

1663
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,280
- He isn't taking my calls. 
- Let me call Apsara.

1664
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,280
- Fine, call her. 
- Come on.

1665
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,040
Calm down, Sushma.

1666
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,280
Continue doing your work.

1667
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,160
We will be going there. 
We will surely go there.

1668
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:13,880
Apsara's phone is switched off.

1669
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,040
That's what I have been trying to say.

1670
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,720
Give it back. 
This is my phone. Let me call them.

1671
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,320
Stop it, guys.

1672
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,840
I've had enough of 
these courtesy messages.

1673
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,160
Chaman.

1674
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,400
I can understand what 
you are going through.

1675
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:07,840
You had been waiting since 
five years for this day and...

1676
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,920
On the day of the engagement, 
she says that she isn't sure.

1677
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,880
This is wrong.

1678
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,480
I didn't expect this from her.

1679
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,360
She didn't think about 
how everyone would feel.

1680
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,800
How you'd feel, how we'd feel.

1681
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,000
Who had thought Mr. 
Batra would do such a thing?

1682
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,960
Kids get off the track sometimes.

1683
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,000
Mr. Batra should have met us.

1684
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,520
We at least deserve much that courtesy.

1685
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,880
He isn't even taking our calls.

1686
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,840
Son, tell me something, has 
she ever told you that she wasn't sure?

1687
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,360
Or did you say something to her?

1688
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:49,760
You sure?

1689
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,240
You cannot trust this generation.

1690
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,010
They think something 
and do something else.

1691
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:55,840
You never know what's on their mind.

1692
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,440
Don't feel disheartened, son.

1693
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:02,200
God will set everything right.

1694
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,880
Your mother and I, 
we will set everything right.

1695
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,200
We are with you, son.

1696
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,360
- Don't worry. 
- Let's go.

1697
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,160
Let's go.

1698
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:39,720
Hi, sir.

1699
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,320
Hi.

1700
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,600
Sorry I heard about your 
engagement being called off.

1701
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,840
It's very sad.

1702
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,880
But there isn't much we can do.

1703
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,480
You know that.

1704
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,760
Take my boyfriend for example.

1705
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,400
He did the same thing.

1706
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,960
Don't be disheartened.

1707
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,800
It doesn't suit you.

1708
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,800
Get over her.

1709
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:25,920
Let's go out for dinner this weekend.

1710
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:29,000
I'm sure you'll feel better.

1711
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,040
It's time for my class.

1712
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,320
I'll get going.

1713
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:36,680
Bye.

1714
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,720
Have some more wine.

1715
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,360
Cheers.

1716
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:03,680
Happy birthday to you.

1717
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,240
Happy birthday dear Apsara.

1718
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,480
Happy birthday to you.

1719
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,480
She's your ex-fiancÃ©e, right?

1720
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:20,560
Hmm.

1721
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,360
Hi. 
Sorry to disturb you guys.

1722
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,600
Today is my birthday, so...

1723
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,320
So sweet.

1724
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,720
Happy birthday.

1725
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,080
Thank you.

1726
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,520
Happy birthday.

1727
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,000
Thank you.

1728
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:46,440
How are you?

1729
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,520
I am good.

1730
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,160
Anyways, enjoy your dinner.

1731
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,320
Bye.

1732
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:03,720
She's a little weird, isn't she?

1733
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,680
I mean...

1734
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,000
Forget it.

1735
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,640
I'll just make a quick 
trip to the washroom.

1736
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,480
Apsara...

1737
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,600
I didn't expect you to be so 
cordial to me after all that happened.

1738
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,000
I had no reason to be rude to you.

1739
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,720
In fact..

1740
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,320
I feel bad for you.

1741
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,920
Learn to face your problems.

1742
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:55,120
So that you never have to 
take a decision under pressure again.

1743
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:02,080
So that you never have to feel 
embarrassed about yourself again.

1744
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:09,560
Anyways..

1745
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,640
..take care.

1746
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,440
Can you come over 
to my place on Saturday?

1747
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,600
I'll introduce you to my parents.

1748
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:44,840
Thank you.

1749
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,040
I'd suggest that you wear 
your hair patch when you come.

1750
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,720
It suits you.

1751
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,880
It makes you look young.

1752
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,000
"What does the heart seek, my lost soul?"

1753
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:37,720
"What does the heart want, my lost soul?"

1754
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:42,680
"What does the heart seek, my lost soul?"

1755
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:47,920
"What does the heart want, my lost soul?"

1756
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:50,840
"There is no desire 
for being desired anymore"

1757
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,520
"Is that a good thing?"

1758
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:58,520
"Why doesn't anything make 
you happy anymore, my lost soul?"

1759
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,640
"My lost soul..."

1760
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,000
"My lost soul..."

1761
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:08,760
"It is time to stop 
and take stock of life"

1762
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,240
"My lost soul..."

1763
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,880
"My lost soul..."

1764
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:19,000
"It is time to stop 
and take stock of life"

1765
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:25,600
"Was what you got not enough?"

1766
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:29,240
"What more did you gain by running away?"

1767
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:31,600
"My lost soul..."

1768
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:34,760
"My lost soul..."

1769
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:39,200
"It is time to stop 
and take stock of life"

1770
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,920
Yes, I had my lunch.

1771
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,080
Yes Shanti, I ate my lunch.

1772
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,360
I'll call you back.

1773
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:52,880
Sir?

1774
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,040
Yes, Raj?

1775
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,400
Tomorrow is my wedding anniversary.

1776
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:59,400
We don't celebrate.

1777
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,640
We'll just have dinner together.

1778
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:02,920
Will you join us, sir?

1779
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,560
Yes, I will.

1780
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:05,720
Thank you, sir.

1781
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,720
I'll Whatsapp you the address.

1782
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,640
Thank you.

1783
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,280
"O' wandering traveller..."

1784
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:18,880
"O' lonely bird, please come back"

1785
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:26,560
"My heart already aches, 
please don't hurt me anymore"

1786
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:32,040
"With open windows 
and doors of the heart..."

1787
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:37,080
"I ask you to please come back"

1788
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,720
"I love you"

1789
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,240
"It's time to make 
yourself a better being"

1790
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:46,110
"Don't push me away, I am your destiny"

1791
01:40:46,190 --> 01:40:48,680
"My lost soul..."

1792
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,360
"My lost soul..."

1793
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:56,000
"It is time to stop 
and take stock of life"

1794
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,000
"My lost soul..."

1795
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,560
"My lost soul..."

1796
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:07,320
"It is time to stop 
and take stock of life"

1797
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,000
"Was what you got not enough?"

1798
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:16,680
"What more did you gain by running away?"

1799
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,320
"My lost soul..."

1800
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,960
"My lost soul..."

1801
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:27,320
"It is time to stop 
and take stock of life"

1802
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,560
"My lost soul..."

1803
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:32,000
"My lost soul..."

1804
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,720
"It is time to stop 
and take stock of life"

1805
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:12,160
- Please have some more, sir. 
- No thank you, Raj.

1806
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,560
Just a little.

1807
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,240
Thank you, sister-in-law.

1808
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,640
It's delicious.

1809
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,520
Why are you not eating?

1810
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,720
She'll have it later, sir.

1811
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,120
Please have it.

1812
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,880
She'll eat later, sir.

1813
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,920
Are you upset over something?

1814
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,760
No, sir. She cannot talk.

1815
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:37,820
What do you mean?

1816
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,160
She is mute, sir.

1817
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,800
But those phone calls?

1818
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,440
I do all the talking, sir.

1819
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:48,560
She just listens.

1820
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:52,920
I understand what her silence means.

1821
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,160
I know what she will ask.

1822
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,440
I take a guess and reply back.

1823
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:59,640
I love her, sir.

1824
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,680
I love her a lot.

1825
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:07,560
I love both the good 
and the bad things about her.

1826
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:10,680
She can make a big list 
of my shortcomings too.

1827
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:11,760
Ask her.

1828
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,320
Yet she loves me a lot.

1829
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,160
This is what our life is.

1830
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:23,720
Remember you had once said 
that we are a perfect couple?

1831
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,240
Do you still feel the same?

1832
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:33,560
This is a strange world, sir.

1833
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,880
We all talk about winning hearts...

1834
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,920
...yet, we need to fall 
in love with the face first.

1835
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:49,680
Sir?

1836
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,640
Are you feeling comfortable here?

1837
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,960
I know it's a small house.

1838
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,440
It's not small, Raj.

1839
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:02,960
It's very big.

1840
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,320
Sir...

1841
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,240
Please have some rice pudding, sir.

1842
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,590
Baldhead!

1843
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:26,000
Baldie!

1844
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,500
[Where I was, there God cannot be, 
where God is, there is no me]

1845
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:54,680
[Very narrow is the street of love 
divine, two cannot pass at the same time]

1846
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,000
Say that again.

1847
01:44:58,280 --> 01:44:59,680
Say it. Don't feel scared.

1848
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:06,360
Baldpate, baldhead, boiled egg, hairless...

1849
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,200
Or baldie.

1850
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:13,280
These are the words we use 
to address a hairless person, don't we?

1851
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:16,800
You haven't said anything wrong.

1852
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:23,760
We are bound call this white 
wall white and this green board green.

1853
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,780
The problem doesn't lie 
in the person who says baldie.

1854
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,080
The problem lies in the 
person who gets irritated by it.

1855
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,080
The problem lies in me.

1856
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:39,560
Where is it written..

1857
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,680
..that fair skin is 
good and dark skin is bad?

1858
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:49,440
That the one with hair is 
handsome and the one without is ugly?

1859
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:55,080
That you should laugh at a 
fat person and not at a thin person?

1860
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,240
Where is this mentioned?

1861
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,160
We made this.

1862
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,560
Our society made this.

1863
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,310
We told everyone that 
this is good and this is bad.

1864
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:08,760
We decided who should 
and should not we make fun of.

1865
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:16,840
We taught everyone to say baldhead, 
baldie, dwarf, midget, black.

1866
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:20,850
To laugh and make fun of them.

1867
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,360
And the people at the 
receiving end too have learnt...

1868
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:28,080
..to take offence and 
then try to change themselves.

1869
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,240
Why change?

1870
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,120
So that no one makes fun of you again?

1871
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,360
So that no one teases you again.

1872
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,040
I feel sad because..

1873
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,160
..what you did to me...

1874
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,480
...I ended up doing 
the same to someone else.

1875
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,080
I ridiculed her.

1876
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:58,920
I teased her.

1877
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,440
I behaved badly with her.

1878
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,200
I judged her for her looks.

1879
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,280
Looks..

1880
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,720
..which are given to us by God.

1881
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,000
Scientifically speaking, 
our genes decide that.

1882
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:26,160
We have no control over them.

1883
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:37,320
Therefore, henceforth, 
anyone can call me anything they want.

1884
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,640
Baldhead, baldpate, baldie.

1885
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:44,600
I wouldn't mind it.

1886
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,280
Yours' truly, the bald Hindi professor.

1887
01:48:58,680 --> 01:48:59,360
Sorry...

1888
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,720
For calling you fatso in 
my mind the first time I saw you.

1889
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:12,520
Sorry...

1890
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,920
For leaving before you 
could finish your noodles.

1891
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,720
Sorry...

1892
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,840
For making you delete 
our picture from Facebook.

1893
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:35,920
Sorry...

1894
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:45,120
For being so stupid.

1895
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,240
Sorry...

1896
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,000
For making you feel 
that you lack something.

1897
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,640
I don't deserve you.

1898
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,280
But...

1899
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,160
I love you.

1900
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:19,360
Can you drop me to the Metro Station?

1901
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,320
Wait.

1902
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:47,970
By the way, don't lose your weight..

1903
01:50:48,050 --> 01:50:49,420
You are looking cute in this.

1904
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,520
Don't do the hair transplant.

1905
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:52,810
You are looking hot in this.

1906
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:59,360
Mr. Batra, ask the professor 
is he going to Apsara out on a honeymoon?

1907
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,880
Or will he take her 
out only for family dinners?

1908
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:02,520
Will you?

1909
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:04,800
- Speak up. 
- I will, next week.

1910
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,480
- Good. 
- Next week.

1911
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,800
- Sister-in-law, may I say something? 
- Sure.

1912
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,080
