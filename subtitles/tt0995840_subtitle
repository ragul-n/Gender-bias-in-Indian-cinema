But isn't our life complete?

36
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:00,697

They're claiming HR killed her.

Of course it's impossible!

146
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:20,997

But she had no idea,

00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,206
that she would have to pay for it,..

168
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:37,374

00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:05,694
Without you my desires
are unfulfilled.

189
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:13,505
You have made me your lover.

190
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:16,405
You have made me your lover.

191
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,533
Okay. One more thing.

192
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,736
lnform those Eurasian associates
that if they don't..

193
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:22,314
..agree to contract l'll sue them for
a demand that they will go bankrupt.

194
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,883
This is Germany here and
l know the law here.

195
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:28,986
Bye.

196
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:44,395
l love you.

197
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:48,268
My friend
- Mon Amie

198
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:54,608
My dear
- Ma cherie

199
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:57,607
What are you up to?

200
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,516
Mona Amie.

201
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:03,482
Shravan
- what are you doing?

202
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:05,456
Learning French, sir.

203
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:09,284
Your geography was never strong.

204
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,889
We're in Germany, not France.

205
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:13,556
Yes. l know.

206
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,300
But l guess you're not aware,

207
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,834
According to a survey,

208
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:19,302
German women are crazy about French.

209
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:22,238
By French they mean French men, kid,

210
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:23,605
Not your pidgin French.

211
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:24,768
You can't stand me being
happy can you?

212
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,903
You screw things up right
at the start of a tour!

213
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:30,680
l don't want to lose my nose
in public because of you.

214
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:37,781
That's something l can never do.

215
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:42,488
lf your nose is gone, how'll you sing?

216
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:17,560
Five million. Not one Euro less.

217
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,825
Mr. Agarwal, tell me..

218
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,702
Have you ever paid more
to a small artist?

219
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:27,898
No, right?

220
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:29,941
Then how can l take less
for a big artist?

221
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:34,972
Hey HR, am l not looking
cool in this photo?

222
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:38,749
Sometimes, l get jealous
at myself, man..

223
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:39,943
And why shouldn't you be?

224
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,310
Money talks, Mr. Agarwal..

225
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:46,381
..and it says that l have
an ace of spades

226
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,789
So the hand has to be mine.

227
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:49,919
lf l'd known l'd have to walk so much

228
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:51,929
l'd have flown down in the jet.

229
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:54,390
Good for you buddy!

230
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,335
No.. That's because you're
an old friend.

231
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:00,668
Otherwise l've got sponsors
lined up to do a Himesh show.

232
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,002
Yeah, so decide fast.

233
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,008
Excellent, excellent.

234
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:08,677
Then send the advance. Ruby will
fax a copy of the agreement.

235
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:10,606
Ok.

236
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:14,613
Nice tea. - Thank you.

237
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:17,679
Hello HR! Welcome to Germany!

238
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:20,723

Your best friend first, business
associate later. Am l right?

Good, good Please sit.

00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,431
Hope your journey was pleasant?

245
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:35,666
Had to walk a lot.

246
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:38,569
Very nice tune

247
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:43,411
You hear tunes in ordinary
sounds..? lmpressive.

248
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:44,642
Thank you

249
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:48,610

00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:41,258
And a great dress.

367
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:45,324
You bet. A great non-dress!

368
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:50,495
l think all women should
dress like this.

369
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:51,827
Absolutely right.

370
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:54,769
She looks so good in a salwar kameez.

371
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:57,569
You've lost it

372
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:01,335
She's not wearing salwar kameez.

373
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:04,011
What if she were?

374
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:08,416
But why would she? What's the problem
with what she's wearing?

375
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:09,784
l like the girl,

376
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,015
l like her clothes,

377
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:12,687
So what's your problem?

378
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:16,025
Just introduce me to her dude.

379
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:19,956
lntroduce? But didn't you
say you've met Riaa?

380
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:22,424
Of course. Who's talking about Riaa?

381
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:31,901
Oh.. You're talking about Riaa!

382
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:42,782
So you can hold her hand and
sing devotional songs,

383
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:46,481
l'm off to the disco to set myself up!

384
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:54,260
l'll call you back.

385
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,591
Hi.. Riaa.. Riaa Bakshi..

386
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:01,931
l'm your event manager.

387
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,740
Actually l'm so sorry

388
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:07,277
This morning l had gone
to inspect your room,

389
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:08,869
and to invite you to the party,

390
00:31:09,347 --> 00:31:10,575
but that thief..

391
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:12,412
But that thief got in with you?

392
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:15,282
Exactly, l mean, that
was my good luck.

393
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,617
lf you hadn't come, l don't know
what could have happened to me

394
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:22,022
l think l was fortunate to get there.

395
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:24,692
Else, what could have happened to me?

396
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:26,421
What?

397
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,292
l mean, if something happened to you,

398
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,766
what would have become of me,
l mean, my concerts?

399
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,435
Oh. Riaa

400
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:38,902
Hi guys, This is Vani, this
is HR, and this is..

401
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:41,973
She's my best friend as well
as my colleague on this tour

402
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:47,747
The passion.

403
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:52,950
The passion.

404
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:59,327
The passion of heart.

405
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:01,757
Ladies and gentlemen..

406
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,967
..tonight is a very special
night for me.

407
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:07,999
My favourite artist is right
here amongst us.

408
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,434
And it would be a shame
if he doesn't sing. lsn't it.

409
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:18,277
So l request Himesh to make this
a night to remember forever and ever.

410
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:20,676
Thank you.

411
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:27,683
lf loneliness gnaws in
the midst of a crowd

412
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:30,724
Then you are in love.

413
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:33,696
And if you are in love

414
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:36,291
Then God help you.

415
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:39,361
Hit it.

416
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:55,311
The passion.

417
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:59,414
The passion of heart.

418
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:03,689
Your memories never
let me stay alone.

419
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:10,927
Your memories never
let me stay alone.

420
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:14,999
ln loneliness too l wasn't lonely.

421
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:19,334
The passion of heart.

422
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:23,006
The passion of heart.

423
00:33:23,348 --> 00:33:27,341
The passion of heart.

424
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:40,788
My dear this is the
limit of my love.

425
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:46,599
l can feel your presence
even when you are far.

426
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:51,574
Now it is hard to
live without you.

427
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:54,771
l want to get you at any cost.

428
00:33:54,846 --> 00:34:02,719
l crave for you so much
that l can't forget you.

429
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:07,585
My beloved.

430
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:13,427
Your memories never
let me stay alone.

431
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:17,594
ln loneliness too
l wasn't lonely.

432
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:21,469
The passion of heart.

433
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,339
The passion of heart.

434
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,278
The passion of heart.

435
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:33,215
The passion of heart.

436
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:37,380
The passion of heart.

437
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:41,289
The passion of heart.

438
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,455
The passion of heart.

439
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:02,906
Yaar l'm in love

440
00:35:04,682 --> 00:35:06,650
For the seventh time in six days.

441
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:12,989
lt's been three hours, but l can't
stop thinking about her man.

442
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,883
Yaar this time its for real

443
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:20,387
l'm thinking
- l'm gonna tell her.

444
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:22,933
No need. Once the booze is over,
you'll forget everything.

445
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:31,770
See, that's your problem. Because
of you, neither of us are married.

446
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,402
lt's my fault?

447
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:38,711
What else? Whenever l fall in love,
you give the entire credit to booze.

448
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,517
Anyway, forget me.

449
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:43,343
You don't drink.

450
00:35:44,556 --> 00:35:46,956
Have you ever felt like this before..

451
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:53,891
that only one girl has taken
over your head and heart?

452
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,358
Which girl?

453
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:02,967
Your salwar kameez girl
- Riaa. Who else?

454
00:36:03,575 --> 00:36:05,236
But you won't be able to tell her so.

455
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:07,778
Shravan, you are drunk

456
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:10,304
And you are in love my friend

457
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:13,782
What rubbish! Stupid.
Hurry up now. 41 .

458
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:18,415
ln your love, l will lose my life

459
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:21,718
Shut up. 42.

460
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:25,820
Well, maybe not your life. But your
heart's aflutter isn't it? Like his?

461
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:28,593
Nothing like that has happened,
nor will it happen, get it?

462
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,325
Why not dude?

463
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:35,535
You've even got God's blessings.

464
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:37,837
Do you now expect Him to
appear and tell you -

465
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,376
Child, you're in love?

466
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:41,939
Don't you get tired saying the
same thing over and over again?

467
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:50,920
lf l get tired, how am l gonna say
'l love you' to every girl l meet?

468
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:57,523
You're losing it. Will you
go to your room now? Please.

469
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:04,291
l'm not booze-drunk,
you're love-drunk!

470
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:18,643
This room is mine, and you can only
leave after you say - l love Riaa.

471
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:21,810
Bani, l don't want to dream
about impossible things.

472
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,654
Dreams and love. Can any
person control these?

473
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:32,620
Anyway, you're never gonna tell
Himesh, but at least tell me!

474
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:36,690
Say it man! lf you can't tell
me, how will you tell her?

475
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:39,326
No. no. no.
- Just say it!

476
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:41,395
Say it! Why are you quiet?

477
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:43,497
Come on. - At least tell me.

478
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,941
Come on say it.

479
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,204
Say it!

480
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:48,336
Say it!

481
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,540
Say it!

482
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:51,741
Say it!

483
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,215
Say it!

484
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:54,342
Say it!

485
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:56,546
C'mon say it say it!
- Ok.

486
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:57,713
Yes.

487
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,381
Say it!

488
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:01,784
OK OK! OK you lout,

489
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:02,917
l love Himesh

490
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:04,619
l love Riaa

491
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:06,960
Now you're talking bro!

492
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:11,830
Now just go and tell
her tomorrow, OK?

493
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:14,430
And l want that!

494
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:16,666
Ok. l'll get it for you!

495
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:19,970
Listen Trishu, don't
be a pest there, OK?

496
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,480
l want that, please!

497
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:25,914
Listen Trishu!

498
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:33,513
HR. That Trishu..

499
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:40,525
HR. This is..

500
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:44,928
Hi l'm Trishu and l am the
luckiest girl in the world

501
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:46,497
Because you're so beautiful?

502
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:49,267
Wrong. Because there's
a hole in my heart.

503
00:38:56,547 --> 00:39:00,506
Kids in the orphanage
are dying to meet you,

504
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:02,951
but Riaa brought only me here.

505
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:06,284
Because l have a big hole in my heart

506
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:10,226
You know why God made you like this?

507
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:11,352
No.

508
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:13,393
Because he loves you a lot.

509
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:16,959
And he knew you'll be
loved by everyone.

510
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,963
For that, you need space
in your heart.

511
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:21,629
Yes.

512
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:24,774
So he's given a lot of
space in your heart.

513
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,768
My child.

514
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:36,376
Tell me something

515
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:40,754
A salesman sells Riaa a 10 Euro
chocolate for 100 Euros.

516
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:42,725
And to me 200 Euros!

517
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:46,753
But he can't sell it to
you even for 1 1 Euros.

518
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:48,765
Ask me why?
- Why?

519
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,858
He can't con you into wearing
his crooked cap.

520
00:39:50,935 --> 00:39:53,563
You already wear a cap!

521
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:05,840
l love you beta

522
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,407
l love you too

523
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:15,848
The feeling of love..

524
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,423
..was aroused by you.

525
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:26,960
l was a poet before.

526
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:32,874
But you made me a lover.

527
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:37,748
Hey lover boy, something for you.

528
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:39,641
Confidential.

529
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:41,884
Will you hold this? Thank you.

530
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:50,852
What is it?

531
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,732
You won't understand.

532
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:03,832
Baby!

533
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:05,936
l can become a billionaire.

534
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:09,944
l think l'm the most luckiest
girl in the whole world.

535
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:13,013
l've got a photo of you smiling!

536
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,883
l think you should laugh more often.

537
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:18,945
You look so good when you smile.

538
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:24,026
Can l ask you something?

539
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:25,987
Sure.

540
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:29,458
lt's the same question the
whole world wants to know

541
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:31,694
Why don't you smile?

542
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:33,770
Why don't you smile?

543
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,911
lt's OK if you don't want to answer.

544
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:45,977
l won't be upset

545
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,512
No Riaa.

546
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,946
l don't want to hide
anything from you.

547
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:52,412
l had an elder brother.

548
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:54,888
He loved me a lot.

549
00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:56,725
He was my world

550
00:41:58,763 --> 00:41:59,991
But one day, suddenly,

551
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:02,424
Brain hemorrhage.

552
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:04,325
He left me alone.

553
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:11,002
And took with him my desire to live.

554
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,408
But after meeting you,

555
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:22,009
l feel like life still
has something to offer.

556
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:27,455
Excuse me.. Hi! Can l please
take a picture with you?

557
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:31,493
Excuse me. - Sorry.

558
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:33,354
Thank you

559
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,967
l'll make all your dreams
come true. HR.

560
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:42,630
l promise

561
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:44,638
l'll always keep you smiling

562
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:04,988
l had another personal
question to ask.

563
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:07,858
But maybe some other time.

564
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:09,627
You can ask tonight.

565
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:19,673
Do you have a girlfriend?

566
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:20,802
No.

567
00:43:21,345 --> 00:43:22,403
Glory to God!

568
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:27,613
l don't believe this! l mean,

569
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:28,947
You're so famous.

570
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:30,879
You travel so much.

571
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:35,283
There has to be someone whom you love

572
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:39,426
There is a girl l like a lot,

573
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:41,294
but l haven't told her so

574
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,358
Why?

575
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:46,497
Some things, when spoken,
lose their meaning.

576
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:50,732
But some things

577
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,301
must be spoken aloud

578
00:43:56,314 --> 00:43:57,508
before it's too late.

579
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:28,006
Our meeting. This feeling of love.

580
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:35,617
lt's nothing but God's
desire, friend.

581
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:41,749
The way you came in my life..

582
00:44:41,826 --> 00:44:45,421
The way you looked at me..

583
00:44:45,629 --> 00:44:53,297
lt's nothing but God's
desire, friend.

584
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:58,241
l don't like anything without you.

585
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:01,904
l don't like anything without you.

586
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:05,909
l don't like anything without you.

587
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:10,420
l don't like anything without you.

588
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:24,592
Our meeting. This feeling of love.

589
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:32,268
lt's nothing but God's
desire, friend.

590
00:45:32,343 --> 00:45:39,943
The way you came in my life.
The way you looked at me..

591
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:47,747
lt's nothing but
God's desire, friend.

592
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,791

593
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:56,697

594
00:45:56,767 --> 00:46:00,567
l don't like anything without you.

595
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:04,870
l don't like anything without you.

596
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:23,783
The intoxication of the heartbeat.

597
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:27,492
The closeness between us.

598
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:30,898
lt is increased by some reason.

599
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:38,566
You are unaware but everyone
in this world knows it.

600
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:42,939
All your desires will be..

601
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:50,814
..fulfilled if you
make are truthful.

602
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:58,694
May God bless all the
pairs made in heaven!

603
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:02,959
ln heaven.

604
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:12,241
Our meeting.

605
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:15,836
This feeling of love.

606
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:23,615
lt's nothing but God's
desire, friend.

607
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:28,587
l don't like anything without you.

608
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:32,493
l don't like anything without you.

609
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:36,260
l don't like anything without you.

610
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:40,531
l don't like anything without you.

611
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:07,659
Why do these moments of..

612
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:11,223
..restlessness pine my heart..

613
00:48:11,302 --> 00:48:14,965
..these days, my dear?

614
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:22,542
Your love gave me
restlessness as gifts.

615
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:26,778
Why do l always remember..

616
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:33,546
..the moments spent with you?

617
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:41,595
ln the depth of heart you
are present like stories.

618
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:46,659
Like stories.

619
00:48:51,742 --> 00:48:55,644
Our meeting.

620
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:59,547
This feeling of love.

621
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:03,417
lt's nothing but God's
desire, friend.

622
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,218

627
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:01,570
HR. l'm so happy you're meeting papa.

628
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:03,772
Don't be so formal Riaa.

629
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,742
l'm glad l'm meeting your papa.

630
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:08,011
lts an honour

631
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:11,981
l wonder why they call you arrogant.

632
00:50:12,356 --> 00:50:13,448
Arrogant?

633
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,560
No idea.. only God knows!

634
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:22,457
lt's strange HR.

635
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:26,034
There's nothing about
you l don't like.

636
00:50:28,372 --> 00:50:29,964
There's nothing about
you that l don't like

637
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:34,510
Riaa.. l..

638
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:38,773
Papa..

639
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:46,715
Hello

640
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,848
Welcome HR

641
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:49,654
You're making our country proud.

642
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,592
You make all of us very proud

643
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:52,720
Thank you sir

644
00:50:52,796 --> 00:50:54,855
l hope Germany is treating you well

645
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:56,763
Oh its treating me absolutely fine.

646
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:01,600
l've never been as happy
as l am in Germany.

647
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,774
Riaa.. Tea, coffee? What'll you have?

648
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:06,901
Not today sir.

649
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:09,608

650
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,410
l came to drop Riaa, and
thought l'd meet you too

651
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:14,610
Stay for longer next time

652
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:15,943

00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,646
You are giving to the world.

654
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:21,816
May god give you twice the joy

655
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:23,291
Thank you so much sir

656
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,725
Stay happy.

657
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:27,923
Papa, phone. l'll see HR off.

658
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:29,798
Yes. See you.

659
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,299
lsn't the weather here strange?

660
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:38,705
lt seems to change by the minute

661
00:51:38,842 --> 00:51:39,968
Forget the weather.

662
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:41,442
You were saying ..?

663
00:51:41,512 --> 00:51:43,912
Me? Yes..

664
00:51:44,314 --> 00:51:45,372
l love Germany

665
00:51:48,585 --> 00:51:50,314
Riaa won't be able to come to Goa.

666
00:51:50,387 --> 00:51:52,753
She's busy with Himesh's shows.

667
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,313
But l'm flying down tomorrow

668
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:57,656
Papa.. lsn't he wonderful?!

669
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:01,320
Yes, he's a good composer and singer.

670
00:52:01,398 --> 00:52:02,524
That's not all.

671
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:03,964
He has no starry attitude

672
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,466
He talks so sweetly,

673
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:08,732
has such a pure heart,

674
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:11,604
has no pretensions..
l mean dad.. he..

675
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:12,733
How do you know?

676
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:13,868
Papa..

677
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:17,540
Look, these people are not like us

678
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:21,015
Their world is one of make believe

679
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:23,751
Even if they want to,

680
00:52:23,821 --> 00:52:26,517
they can't escape that
make believe world.

681
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,525
No papa. Himesh isn't like that.

682
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:31,527
He's different from the other stars.

683
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:32,653
Didn't you see?

684
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:34,219
He came to drop me,

685
00:52:34,298 --> 00:52:35,595
showed you respect,

686
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:38,291
and you too spoke so nicely with him.

687
00:52:40,304 --> 00:52:42,568
Of course. He was a guest.

688
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:45,735
Look, l'm not saying he's a bad guy.

689
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:48,238
All l'm saying, is that

690
00:52:48,312 --> 00:52:49,973
we cannot befriend him.

691
00:52:50,314 --> 00:52:51,975
Himesh isn't like that papa.

692
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:53,573
l know it.

693
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,978
What do you want to say?

694
00:52:57,788 --> 00:53:01,246
Papa.. l..

695
00:53:03,327 --> 00:53:04,589
And Himesh loves me too.

696
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:05,719
Riaa..

697
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:09,657
Don't be crazy!

698
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:12,632
Has he told you That he loves you?

699
00:53:12,703 --> 00:53:14,466
But papa l know it!

700
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:15,766
You know nothing!

701
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:18,700
How do l explain?

702
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:21,936
He doesn't love you, and
he'll never admit it.

703
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:23,904
He'll just use you and..

704
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:30,946
At best, you will be his
flavour of the month

705
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:35,850
Look, your happiness is
all that matters to me.

706
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:37,692
But l've seen the world.

707
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:41,793
Our world is different from his.

708
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:45,830
You can't be a part of that world

709
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:51,397
The sooner you realize this,

710
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,368
the better it is.

711
00:54:08,926 --> 00:54:10,587
Yeah l'm at Mr. Khurana's place.

712
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:11,753
Where are you?

713
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:13,625
l've suddenly fallen ill.

714
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,392
Won't you handle it?

715
00:54:16,466 --> 00:54:18,764
l'll do that But did
you call a doctor?

716
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:20,632
Yeah, l've called.

717
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:24,935
l'm getting my body checked now.

718
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:32,276
OK.. OK bro.

719
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:35,476
He'll never change.

720
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:36,712
Liar!

721
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,780
Oh hi Ruby. Looks like l'm at the
wrong place at the wrong time.

722
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,653
You're at the right place
at the right time Himesh

723
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:47,629
All this is for you.

724
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:52,625
Mr. Khurana has called me here
to discuss something important.

725
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:55,771
l have a proposal for you

726
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,933
A world tour concert
Three months later.

727
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:00,401
Please sit down

728
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:02,573
Aren't you doing a concert..

729
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:05,945
..with superstar Sameer
Siddiqui in three months?

730
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:09,552
Who cares? Everything
can be changed. Cheers!

731
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:11,311
l don't drink.

732
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:17,885
l've committed to the Rahejas
for a world concert.

733
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:19,926
Khurana won't like that

734
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:22,427
He's a good businessman.

735
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:25,332
He'll understand. Maybe
some other time.

736
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:28,803
Relax Himesh. Forget the world tour.

737
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:31,430
How about a nice romantic vacation?

738
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:34,271
Just you.. and me?

739
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:36,603
Ruby.

740
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:40,545
You've got me love struck

741
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:42,517
Rubyji, please!

742
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:44,281
You've got me love struck

743
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:46,413
Back off Ruby. Behave yourself.

744
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,958
What's the problem Himesh?
Don't you know l love you?

745
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:50,751
l don't.

746
00:55:52,729 --> 00:55:53,821
But you will.

747
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:57,892
Eventually, every man
falls in love with me.

748
00:55:59,302 --> 00:56:00,792
And l don't blame them

749
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:03,831
Ruby, l love Riaa.

750
00:56:04,574 --> 00:56:05,939
l love her a lot.

751
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:08,575
True love.

752
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:18,616
Ruby will send you the dates.

753
00:56:19,322 --> 00:56:20,949
You just select the venue Mr Patel.

754
00:56:21,324 --> 00:56:24,987
How are you? l'm so sorry,
for being so late.

755
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:29,926
But what to do? Sponsors keep
calling for our world tour!

756
00:56:30,634 --> 00:56:33,660
Ruby must have made you our offer?

757
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:35,796
Yes.

758
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:38,732
l'm sorry sir.

759
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:40,675
l've committed to the Rahejas.

760
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:44,578
Really? What are you saying? Good!

761
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:46,743
No problem, no problem.

762
00:56:46,817 --> 00:56:48,546
There's a solution for that too.

763
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:56,556
Take this blank cheque.

764
00:56:56,727 --> 00:56:57,955
Fill in whatever amount you want.

765
00:56:58,028 --> 00:57:01,225
Money talks my friend!

766
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:05,293
Give the Rahejas whatever
fines you have to,

767
00:57:05,368 --> 00:57:07,734
but your world tour will be with us.

768
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:11,706
l'm sorry Khurana sahab.
l've given my word.

769
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:14,641
Look son. l'm not boasting..

770
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:18,647
..but l'm the biggest
presenter in the world today.

771
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:21,309
And you're the biggest performer.

772
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:22,908
We make a great team.

773
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,551
Who are theses Rahejas? Nobodies!

774
00:57:26,623 --> 00:57:29,820
The Rahejas signed me
when l was a nobody.

775
00:57:29,893 --> 00:57:31,451
l won't back out.

776
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:35,322
You're a man of your word.

777
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:37,332
l like it.

778
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:39,866
God bless you my child.

779
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:41,662
Thank you sir.

780
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:46,834
Hello, yes, excellent, excellent.

781
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:48,744
Are you allergic to proposals?

782
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:50,675
You snubbed Khurana's decent proposal,

783
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:53,306
Rejected Ruby's indecent proposal,

784
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:56,351
And you didn't even propose to Riaa!

785
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:59,384
l can't figure out Ruby
and Khurana bro.

786
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:01,418
And Riaa -

787
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:02,884
She's on her way here.

788
00:58:03,326 --> 00:58:04,418
l'll definitely tell her today.

789
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:07,722
She's here!

790
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:10,461
Riaa! Nadia..

791
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,398
Hi Himesh l'm here
for my interview. No.

792
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:16,734
No, no, not today on Thursday
9 pm till then bye, bye.

793
00:58:18,308 --> 00:58:20,469
Why's Nadia popping up in
your love story with Riaa?!

794
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:24,310
Riaa! Vani.. Hi!

795
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:25,607
Where's Riaa?

796
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:26,740
She's gone.

797
00:58:26,817 --> 00:58:27,875
Where?

798
00:58:27,984 --> 00:58:29,246
lndia
- for her cousin's engagement

799
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:31,547
And l'm worried uncle might
get her married too.

800
00:58:31,688 --> 00:58:32,746
What nonsense Vani

801
00:58:33,523 --> 00:58:34,581
Marriage ain't a joke.

802
00:58:35,258 --> 00:58:37,283
She'll never agree. lmpossible!

803
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:39,554
No point getting mad at me!

804
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:41,596
Scolding me won't get you Riaa.

805
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:44,256
l kept telling you -

806
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:46,564
Say it, say it, say it.

807
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:48,697
We're late dude.

808
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:52,266
And even if her dad
fixes her marriage,

809
00:58:52,342 --> 00:58:53,434
why would she say no?

810
00:59:32,616 --> 00:59:33,742
HR?

811
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,685
You left without telling me?

812
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:43,349
l tried calling you,

813
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,757
but couldn't get through.

814
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:48,389
Liar! Are you avoiding me?

815
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:52,626
No HR. l just had to come here.

816
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:55,665
A lie! Your dad told
you to not to, right?

817
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:01,706
No. Papa had said nothing.

818
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,779
l love you Riaa. l love you.

819
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:13,822
Your voice is breaking HR..

820
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:17,485
You're lying Riaa.

821
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:20,454
l love you.

822
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:22,559
Can you hear me now?

823
01:00:28,438 --> 01:00:30,736
l've never said this to anyone Riaa,

824
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:33,667
but l'm telling you. l love you

825
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:35,969
Do you love me?

826
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,340
Look, don't lie, OK?

827
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:49,417
Hadn't l forbidden this?

828
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:53,762
lt's easy to talk furtively
on the phone.

829
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:58,431
Lovers have the courage to declare
it before the world.

830
01:00:59,336 --> 01:01:01,964
Papa.. eh..

831
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:40,642
Let my fingers lie in you hair locks.

832
01:01:42,312 --> 01:01:52,347
Let my mistakes lie on your lips.

833
01:01:53,423 --> 01:02:02,923
Let the tale of my life
lie in your heart.

834
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:10,535
Let it be, let it be.

835
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:30,952
Never lie.

836
01:02:34,931 --> 01:02:37,832
Never lie.

837
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:44,864
Never lie.

838
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:48,903
Dear speak the truth.

839
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:55,645
Never lie. Dear speak the truth.

840
01:02:55,718 --> 01:03:00,917
The amount of love l have in
my heart is in yours too..

841
