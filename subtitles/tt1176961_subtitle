Look at his name. Kiska MigIani.

538
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:30,000
His mothe aised a question on
his birth and Ieft him to be aised.

539
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:33,997
When he has to taIk

When did you etun,
Kiska? You didn't teII us.

568
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:16,303
You shouId have
given us a missed caII.

569
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:21,101
Idiots. Get out.

570

00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:12,362
20-25.
- What ae you saying?

592
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:15,223
Look, we can do one thing.

593

We aII wiII contibute

So that we can get a
smaII fIat on ent.

My contibution.

00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:33,308
ExactIy. We have nothing.

600
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:35,911

601
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:38,587
Because we have to send moe
than haIf the money to ou famiIies.

602
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:44,591
We spend the emaining on ou

00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:47,729
Foget it. Why ae

616
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:22,424
It's the same thing.

617
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:24,767
Yes!

618
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:39,249
We ae in a foeign county.
Ou income is Iess.

619
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:41,649
And we don't have a pIace to stay.

620
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:45,246
Hea the tune of the heart.

621
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:47,791
It gives onIy tension.

622
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,657
We just need a pIace to stay.

623
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,253
Why ae we being punished?

624
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:58,864
We just need a pIace to stay.

625
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:02,270
Why ae we being punished?

626
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,332

At times, we have a
budget but not a fIat.

634
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:24,828
At times, we find a fIat but
it doesn't fit ou budget.

635
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:28,288
A few days ago,

I am taIking about the same fIat.

645
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:01,456
Mango.

646
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,724
But it's the season of oanges.
Why shouId we say mango?

647
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,860
I mean, say fo the sake of it.

648
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:12,534
Look, we have decided.
We wiII give that fIat to a mango man.

649
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,340
Mango man?
- Common man.

650
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:18,415
It's the same thing.
- They don't know.

00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:23,877
Okay. QuickIy give the infection.
- Infection?
