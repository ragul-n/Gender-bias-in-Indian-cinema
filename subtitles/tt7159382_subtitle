How many times? Who is going to school?
The last time am saying Buzi

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,290
I need a friend
You want a wife

That's September 15th
Mother's birthday

16
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,430
You should go and see her right now

17
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,280
My dear

18
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,720
Right

I'll come back later

21
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,620
Do not look down on the ground
It does not look like self-esteem

22
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,150
Look at the girl's eyes
Be confident

23
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,470
Do not drink cigarettes
The girls do not like

24
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,450
Do not make serious face
Make some laugh

25
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,140
These are Buzi's drugs
Keep it safe

26
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,640
Can't you see
I will break your teeth

27
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,360
Because the sorceress was big wheat
It's come again

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,750
We're getting married to a married man
There should be. There should be money

35
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,310

We're a two-grade marriage
That's why every homework is at home

43
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,180
Son, I'm against the dowry
I do not even like dowry

44
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,740
You do not need to say anything

45
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,750

This is bad to take cigarette while drinking
It's good to take while talking

63
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,290
That's right

64
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,860
What are they doing?
Will they do anything?

65
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,580

114
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,210

Feminist sister

128
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,740
Why are you trying to kill yourself?

129
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,320
Do you have anger with me?
Is there any problem?

130
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,520
These are our roads.
We're going to the way we want

131
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,880
Do you have any connection?

132
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:18,890
Do not

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,660
Stay here

134
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,100
Are you the only one?
Is this your sister too?

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,260
Do not say anything about this sister
He is golden

136
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,000
What are you laughing at?

137
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,900
Is it a joke to visit the Females?

138
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,500
Do you know how horrible it is to be?

139
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,440
Who will be?
What are you doing?

140
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,010
Flowers, new cats,
Facial

141
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,120
No sleep for the rest
When I go, I do not have a nap

142
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,060
Have you come to look like this?
You're so good to say

143
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,980
We have to go and look at each other

144
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,280
I want to see my brother

145
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,410
And then sir
No brain for you?

146
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,350
Tell me anything
Do not tell my brother

147
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,200
He is golden

148
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,760
And second thought was the second idea

149
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,010
I really want to kill you

150
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,980
Such a second kind of thing is my car
It's going to be taken over by it

151
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,640
It's not easy for me to go with you

152
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,430
I'm leaving

153
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,640
Stop the car

154
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,360
And why are we at your house for what?
There was a hotel better

155
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,440
If there's something wrong, go
We have not got it. I'm leaving

156
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,490
Stop the car
My dad will kill

157
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,360
Why?
That the bridegroom was dishonored

158
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,850
I'll follow you by a aan auto to your car
You do not say anything to your dad

159
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,710
Actually it's stopping the car

160
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
Is this a cause to say no?
Bribery is not a joke for us

161
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,180
Calling me rowdy
How beautiful your elder sister got caught?

162
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,030
You're hitting first
But think it

163
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,370
Right

164
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,950
No money

165
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:22,930
why?

166
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,210
There's the brain
In Pockets I do not take anything

167
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,440
I really like Renuka

168
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,940
I think I really likes her

169
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,730
Go and tell

170
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,680
That's all I need to look at
What made you sin?

171
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,350
We're so close
They want to know

172
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,120
You're very good. She's right
Her sister is

173
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,650
I think she's crazy

174
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,130
I was left on the road
And why are we here?

175
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,540
Would be good at a hotel

176
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,950
They're very good
I'm not leaving

177
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,940
Go and tell

178
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,460
Do not worry
Okay Chief

179
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,040
I'm saying this. Telling you myself
It's all nonsense

180
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,810
Actually, you and he should talk

181
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,850
He's always running after work

182
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,790
He is not a human being

I did not know anything about you

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,890
There's nothing special about me
I'm an ordinary person

192
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,510

Sir, not much

210
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,370

Big brother. Sober? I do not know

00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,020
At the same time everything will be over
That's why the aunt told me to get out

What's my problem?

219
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:10,770

239
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,610
Do not you look humpy?

240
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,380
There's crazy crazy about that

241
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,790

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,150
sister is going to bark her

250
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,040
Ask her

251
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,570
And they get a bad guy

252
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,660
Stay with the girlfriends
It's wrong to think that way

253
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,380
Then

254
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,030

What's wrong with that?

271

Our uncles are in Vigaz
They'll talk to you all along

272
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,470
It's not like that
I like Renua a lot

273
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:08,930
Rennua?

274
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,280
But?

275
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,990

00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,800
Satiyakinda? So fast?
I'll take her out of Visa

281
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,350
Will not you ever be able to wait again?
I have one request

282
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:39,920
Is There a Lantern? (Dish)

283
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,470

284
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,800
Look at you

289
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,600
Be careful

290
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,770
Where are they from?

291
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,200
I was exhausted
Soaked and gone?

292
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,430
You To

293
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,050

Do you support me now?

295
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,780
There must be a brain
Now ask

296
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,320
Wait. My dad's talking
Family stories. I am afraid

297
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,780
That one
About the boy

298
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,340
What do you say?

299
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,270
Dad would like

300
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,990
Before I could

301
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,770
Do not read such absurdities

302
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,460
Say exactly what you like

303
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,950
Re-father every day
You need medicine

304
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,170

305
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,730
I'll tell the dad

306
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,680
Stay here
sister likes him

307
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,580
What's this?

308
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,680
There is a little

309
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,310
Sister's marriage. How not?
Come here

310
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:22,490
Dad would like. I would have had time to do it before.
Do not be like that

311
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,080
Think well
Are you ok

312
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,030
I asked now
You and I are the same one

313
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,640
You asked?
Tell

314
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,130
What did you say then?
And said

315
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,140
Now there is

316
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,320
My sweetheart

317
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,660
It's your luck

318
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,560
Very happy
The boy is fine

319
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,440
That's not it. When you left
Who gives me medicine?

320
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,960
I'm there

321
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:52,990
Or not?

322
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,160
Now go
Go

323
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,450
Now I am

You are

326
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Something like that

327
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,970
Get out of the week?

328
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,130

330
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,640
Big mistake

331
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,420
You should go all the same

332
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,210

333
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm not going

334
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,550
Marriage is anything
I'm not going

335
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,370
Actually, I'm not doing it

336
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,920
Now say it

The show was given

339
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,150
It's your responsibility

340
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,790
Visitors

341
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,000
The time is not clear

342
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,750
Our village is awesome

343
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,440

Why?
It's a habit

347
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,740
Not in America?

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,240
Have shower. Going to the shower

Bloody Lizard

354
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:38,960
Lizard?

355
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,560
There is no such thing
No, I'm not used. That's why I'm asleep

356
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,810
Where are you going?
Are you ready?

357
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,710

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,730
3.00 should say ... get up
I wanted to take a bath

364
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,590

00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:03,430
There

367
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,070
Why should they go there?
It's not like this

368
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,470
It's not the point
Are you so hungry?

369
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,890
Not only that, but also to sleep

370
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,020
I asked to bring food

371
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,420
Is that there?

372
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,390
Tell him?

373
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,130
Tell?
 - Do not you tell me?

374
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,240
Crucial?

375
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,260
Get up early in the morning and take pictures?

376
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,480
There is a deadweight

377
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,520
There's more. A certificate
told?

378
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,750
Are the girls in India kidding?

379
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,060
Not girls
Girl

380
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,600
Vanumati

381
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,140
It's one

382
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,600
Two ways
A hybrid girl

383
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,820
You and your agriculture language

384
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,720
Is your brother good?

385
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,820
why?

386
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,570
Our selves are a very good person

387
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:41,790
Not like me

388
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,040
No anger
Do not talk

389
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,300
Very good

390
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,820
About your brother

391
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,830
Your sister-in-law says gold
I'll know what's right

392
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,480
Is not it still familiar to our brother?

393
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,060
Got it
But it's scary

394
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,690
Scared?
Why?

395
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,150
Everyone is with you

396
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,700
There is nothing to be afraid of
Promise?

397
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,810
Promise

398
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,670
Whenever you go to the Temple
3:00 am

399
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,640
Come

400
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,550
Our brother in lay's young brother

401
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:41,710
Our village

402
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,460
I need toilet paper

403
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,190
How? Well
They're ours

404
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,910

Wonderful!

411
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,720
The best ones, sir

412
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,320
If you're building something
There's something to worry about

413
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,670
Do you work for rent?

414
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,720
There's nothing else, sir

415
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,510

00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,210

Hey, are you crazy?
Freak

421
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,490
Look, I thought
That's why

422
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,690
When did I watch you?

423
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,540
Is not I good to see?

424
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,930
Why so good for that?
Should have heard

425
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,540
See if you want

Boys are so crazy ...

440
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,450
Men will be very fooled to watch you cheat on you.

441
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,520
If your soul gets hot, that shit ... you're wrong ...

442
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:18,420
You're right for everything, just like everyone else
Feel free to apologize

00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:24,030

This guy is very tall

449
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:20,820
How To Knock Her ... Kid Kissing?

450
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:25,430
How To Knock Her ... Kid Kissing?

451
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:29,490
You will need a ladder for his height ...

452
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:34,540
That's not a problem, do not worry

453
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,880
I can play and kiss you

454
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:48,190
He came ... the girl is looking for you ...

Thinking About It Will Disturb Your Own Heart ...

458
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,560
Is not it embarrassing? So many lessons
It was taken. I figured

459
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,710
Did you change that?
Do not study unless done

460
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,210
Beautiful dancing

461
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,830
What happened to the land? I'll give it to the grandpa

462
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,330
Good luck
We are happy too

463
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,360
The landlords will not come to your place

464
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,490
It did a good job

465
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,610
I did not expect it

466
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,140
Do I need to help something?
Read the exam tomorrow.

467
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:45,120
Come on. Tell me again
Come on

468
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,390
Great

469
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,980
The picture taken from here?

470
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,380
Draw these graph

471
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,210
You could
Yes

472
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,070
Shuffled up these lessons
What do you mean by then?

473
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,810
Do the job
Do I not know?

474
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,350
Stay
Rub the rubber

475
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,450
What are you giving?
Rubber

476
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,990
In American condom is called rubber

477
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,190
Oh, shame

478
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,900
We often say in our country

479
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,330
To use condoms

480
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,530
Or AIDS will rise

481
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:03,490
Billions are spent on ad

482
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,470
What about better knowledge about this?

483
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,480
What do you say?

484
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,110
Everything is checking for me
There is no such thing

485
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,410
But if I think so,
What do you think?

486
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,750
Whatever the sphere
It's not good either, Vanu

487
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,160
Tea?

488
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:19,370
Known previously? Everything is for Bujji
I do what I do

489
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,320
Bathing, feeding,diper changing
All things

490
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,080
There are no problems with this connection

491
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,040
It was late and Bujji was born

492
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,750
Actually, my brother adopted him

493
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:36,800
I thought it was the first days
he was only two-and-a-half years old

494
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,470
He loves him
Bujji knows it?

495
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,130
yes
Actually, he's proud

496
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:47,130
We were just born
He thinks that he has approached her mom

497
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,890
I had a lot of doubts about you

498
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,530
But it's clear

499
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,880
She'll be happy
I got it well

500
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,790
Whatever I said
You do not take Akiva's side

501
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,920
is it?
Is that so?

502
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,980
Put it right away

503
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:13,290
What about me? Why?
Tell

504
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,100
There's a test
Let's study?

505
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,220
Give Father's medication
I'm leaving

506
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,290

Forgotten

510
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:04,380
My mistake

511
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,140
Because you are a kid

512
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,330
In the morning, the exam

513
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,720
Go and sleep

514
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,260
Sorry, Dad

515
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:22,320
Dad, I'm your gold, right?

516
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,370
My daughter. You're not just gold

00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:05,630
Poor situation
He's very anxious

522
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:10,160
It was right if I had one

523
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,250
We do not have any sets

524
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,910
Will you all leave?

525
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,340
Do not leave me

526
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,530

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,570
How are you doing exams?

549
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:37,110
Everyday:
Let's go to the cantine. That's the crowdy place

550
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:41,310
Howz your exam?
Written well. Written better?

551
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:49,120
You eat

552
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,250
Where is the rest of the room? It's gone straight away
Turn. I will be back

553
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,480
Your guy is right
Everyone thinks

554
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:09,670
Just wait

555
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,850
He's a coward

556
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,990
He has no guts

557
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,660
When Naresh was commenting,
He only says Let's go, let's go

558
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:22,230
He wanted to make this clear
So, what's up, or is it?

559
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,650
Dialogue?

560
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,570
It's the reason for me

561
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,830
Shift + Delete. The game's over
Shop closed

562
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,050
Is that so?

563
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,480
Just ask for the exam
Should I Touch It?

564
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:52,560
Should I interrupt?

565
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,060
What for?

566
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:57,670
Want?

567
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:58,460
learn

568
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:08,420
There

569
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,460
First, take the numbers

570
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,460
Telling you
And build. It hurts, sir

571
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,130
Leave Sir
Hand sir

572
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,310
Answer this
question

573
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,810
He said well
That means they're wasting you too?

574
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,420
learn

575
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,050
What's so hilarious?
Is that so much?

576
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:48,290
He beat them all

577
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,490
Are you hurt?
not. It's okay

578
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,220
What are you eating?

579
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,460
What is it? Hot meals in the morning
After that, vegetables

580
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,470
One reason, God
One reason

581
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,210
Do not leave me

582
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,070
We're both good people
Let's go

583
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,600
Do not think so much
Let's go to train tomorrow

584
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:15,750
These are times like this
Never come back

585
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,290
Be happy right now

586
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,360
How do you know your face
Bright

587
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,360
Go

588
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:26,510
Stay

589
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:45,120
Hey boy ... What's the matter?
You're my sweetheart.

590
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:56,000
Hey guys ... do not be so evil to me ...
You'll make my heart ticker.

591
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:01,790
Happiness is turning into you

592
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:07,550
Whatever you do does not exist in one place

593
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:27,590
Hey boy ... What's the matter?
You're my sweetheart.

594
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:39,090
Hey guys ... do not be so evil to me ...
You'll make my heart ticker.

595
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:33,200
Slight rains fall to ground floor

596
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:43,760
I will be with you in my heart

597
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:52,100
At this glitzy, ... a hurricane is on

598
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,920
I do not know what is going on with me

599
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:10,210
Heavy rains in my rain

600
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:30,070
Hey boy ... What's the matter?
You're my sweetheart.

601
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:40,840
Hey guys ... do not be so evil to me ...
You'll make my heart ticker.

602
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:47,010
Happiness is turning into you

603
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,470
Whatever you do does not exist in one place

604
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,390
This is for you
There is no mum's ornaments

605
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:45,890
I've been waiting for the day

606
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,460
It's all funny
Are you holding up your marriage?

607
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,310
Eat dear
No fat. Nothing

608
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,610
Eat dear
I am  telling you

609
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:18,220
Eat - Because it puts blue
Can't you eat for me?

610
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:22,440
You want this too, Sister?

611
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,190
The first time we sleep in other beds

612
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,510
You can not even think
I really can not think

613
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,000
What are you doing, Sister?

614
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,080
All right
Why are we going?

615
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,440
Just do not ask a cow once

616
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:48,730
Good one
Just once

617
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,940
To stay here

618
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:54,200
Such things are in dreams
Actually, it does not. You ask me

619
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,990
No matter where the royalist is, go outside
He came and took the prince away

620
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,340
There is not that palace

621
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:00,910
Go

622
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,380
Tell me talking

623
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:07,140
Are not you nuts?
Is not it sad?

624
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,360
How do you take it?

625
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:17,320
trust
Belief in him

626
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:22,560
That's the reason
Everything is taken

627
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,800
You can ask that trust

628
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:25,980
To stay here

629
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,620
Right

630
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,450
You have to ask when the time comes

631
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,040
Love you
Let's wait here. That's all

632
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,760
Terms set?

633
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,400
He's a Dock in America
Think about it

634
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,930
That's not it
If not,

635
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,700
Not even supposedly
Do not say

636
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,040
Where is my coffee?
coming

637
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,240
Station Master called

638
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,170
Just told me a little bit

639
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:37,830
Let's go to the train. Do not go anywhere
I'm going to the second class. There is something to ask

640
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,290
It's very important

641
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:45,270
Hey, bunny. come here
What happened?

642
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,480
Nothing

643
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:50,950
Do not forget
Train

644
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:05,680
Shame on you?
I did not help those guards

645
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,650
Look at Eve

646
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,040
Do not do that
Tell the boy

647
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,410
come here

648
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,510
Not you
I'll tell him

649
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:16,110
You go in the car with the sycamore

650
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:17,500
They're going to train

651
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,350
You are

652
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:19,650
Got it?

653
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:10,060
I'll be on the train
You two are right

654
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:11,330
Why?

655
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,230
I'll say it
Although

656
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:38,210
What are you doing here?

657
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,390
The brother-in-law has to stay with her sister
I was going to call the train

658
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,110
That's not the boy

659
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,120
They're fine, give it a try

660
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,730
Because what happened?
Wait a bit late

661
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,370
There's room for that

662
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:12,840
I will come

663
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:49,320
Where are you?
She's with shilu ,sister

664
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,760

665
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,960
Do not worry

01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:23,760
We are in the first grade
Give them to them

667
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,510

01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,590
Food, sir. I'm not hungry
Now what to eat

669
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:43,650
We do not want

670
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:44,750
Let's go

671
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,050
Eat banana

672
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:55,830
Bujjie did not eat anything

673
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:56,870
Give it to him

674
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:06,190
What has happened is Shiloh

675
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,280
I'll get you visa, campus for me

676
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:13,080
What's on here
Honey, this is not except me

677
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,220
One of the vacanssion is good

678
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,510
But the future is over

679
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:20,750
I'll take care of those in my house
Come on

680
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:22,150
Let's get married later

681
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,040
Right

682
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:25,080
All right

683
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,880
Before I was born, I died

684
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:49,610
Now the reasons are not necessary

685
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,100
What happened, daughter?

686
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,910
What's here?

687
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:09,230
Remembering your sister?
It's not like that

688
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:12,820
You are there

689
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,220

Here
Take the bag

704
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,180
Where is Vanu?

705
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,830
Call her

706
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,150
Her memories are her feelings

707
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:50,270
I will not be locked out

708
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:55,360

01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:51,030
Her memories will be kept spiritually

716
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:54,290
She does not leave me
I will not come closer to me too.

717
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:59,120
Why my wonder happens to my heart

718
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:38,310
That pains my soul will put me in
How can I be saved?

719
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:52,120
I just want to stay with you
Why is this change of hearts always different?

720
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:58,530
Your memories will consistently beat me

721
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:04,870
I will forget about myself and will find you

722
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,860
Narash is here

He liked you and you will also like him

724
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,330
They were asked to ask their mother

725
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,440
I have not sent her sister for 2 days
Did you grab me right away?

726
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:17,050
Throw me
Get me out

727
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,080
She does not leave me

01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:36,310
This is the grinder
This coffee machine

1094
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:41,880
This is Dishwasher

1095
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:44,020
That toaster

1096
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:49,940
My gift
What  you brought for me

1097
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:50,860
No, no

1098
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:14,590
It's not ashamed
Do you?

1099
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:31,200
No problem
I will clean my room

1100
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:00,730
This is not the village
US

1101
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:10,360
If you say, I'll do more

1102
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:14,050
You were good at that time
It's bad now

1103
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,200
What's up?
Big Boiler is a chicken

1104
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:37,200
Is a boiler chicken?

1105
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:52,140
Because this is all this

1106
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:05,030
Absolutely wonderful?

1107
01:58:45,630 --> 01:58:48,290
All right, right?
There's nothing bunn. Everything's right

1108
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:56,690
What happened? Why did she come with you?
Why?

1109
01:58:57,090 --> 01:59:01,340
Both kill them
Something happened to me if I were in jail

1110
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:05,420
Come with the party. What's wrong?
And who did you get this dress with you?

1111
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,580
When we go to the mill ... it's good
Just do it

1112
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:10,060
And what about your ideas?

1113
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:14,580
If you have anger
Blame me

1114
01:59:14,810 --> 01:59:16,010
I'm with you in anger

1115
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:18,850
What did he do? What are you saying?
He's the first friend of mine

1116
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:20,400
My will
You shut up

1117
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:23,200
Why should I shut up?
I'm talking about your anger

1118
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:26,620
From the day it comes out
You do not like me staying here. Yes, I do not

1119
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:30,750
You do not like America. I would not like to come to my house
You do not like coming here
1,216
01:59:31,410 --> 01:59:33,990
You saw Susie and saw you
What did I do?

1120
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:35,400
You get me flattering

1121
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:38,520
It's all about you
And what's this dress?

1122
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:40,320
Have you ever been tried?
Know how

1123
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:43,650
pull. Throwing well
Draw anything

1124
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:45,550
Close your eyes if you have a chance

1125
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:48,620
Are not we going to talk a little?

1126
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:52,990
Whatever it is, go straight
I must have the strength to a man

1127
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:55,430
I have the strength
That's why my feelings are directly said

1128
01:59:55,470 --> 01:59:56,210
That's my character

1129
01:59:56,810 --> 01:59:59,700
There are no 10 things like you
I saw a lot of your character

1130
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:01,320
In pictures

1131
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:05,780
What. Room. I saw great
 Shailu and I are

1132
02:00:07,410 --> 02:00:09,810
If you have a girl with a girl?

1133
02:00:10,010 --> 02:00:13,500
Because of this, golden idioms just lost

1134
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:16,890
Talk to Shiloh
I do not care

1135
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:19,470
You got a mess
That's why it came

1136
02:00:19,850 --> 02:00:21,440
I came harshly

1137
02:00:23,790 --> 02:00:25,080
I came to my sister hood

1138
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,880
Not for you
So why did you wear this dress?

1139
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:30,570
Whom did you wear for?
Why did you come to my house?

1140
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:31,980
for you

1141
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,870
You keep everything in check
Let me go now

1142
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:38,020
You'll have to go

1143
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:42,200
Go to your village

1144
02:01:04,830 --> 02:01:06,130
I will go
1,242
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,810
where?
To my dad

1145
02:01:11,860 --> 02:01:12,800
I am afraid

1146
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:14,760
Good for you

1147
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:17,410
Where to go?
Are you mad?

1148
02:01:17,670 --> 02:01:20,030
Do not you have until delivery?
Do not you see the child?

1149
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:22,230
I'll leave

1150
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:25,990
I will go
What happened? Why are you crying?

1151
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:29,760
Book ticket please

1152
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,530
I am afraid

1153
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:34,100
Do not cry, Vanu

1154
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:38,310
Vanu. You sit

1155
02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:42,000
Let's book
scared for dad

1156
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:44,410
What happened, daughter?

1157
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:48,740
Nothing. How are you?
Sis is fine

1158
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:49,910
There is no problem

1159
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:52,600
Doctor said
I'm coming, Dad

1160
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:53,690
I'll talk with your sis

1161
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,580
Do not worry
Hold it, daughter

1162
02:01:58,370 --> 02:01:59,270
What are you doing?

1163
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:01,760
Yare in America 
but you are not coming to my home

1164
02:02:02,210 --> 02:02:04,160
Say good
This is asking

1165
02:02:04,370 --> 02:02:06,570
If you do not come home, I will
not talk to you

1166
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,050
 call your brother-in-law

1167
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:10,900
The cursor summoned Sumati

1168
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,330
Can we go for a week?

1169
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:16,030
We should meet before going to India
Or  she will kill me

1170
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:17,570
She is in the phone

1171
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,090
Ok

1172
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:22,860
I will come

1173
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:25,360
Varun, she wants to go Sumathi's house
Drop her

1174
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:30,150
I have work today

1175
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:34,920
Tomorrow morning is ok?
Just drop her

1176
02:03:03,970 --> 02:03:04,930
Down

1177
02:03:14,910 --> 02:03:17,330
Get this ticket and get on the bus
Sumathi's house can go

1178
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:02,480
Let's go

1179
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:05,040
No need
I'll go on the bus

1180
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:08,480
I won't come
It's the last bus

1181
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:10,950
Vanu,get on the car

1182
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:14,040
I'm not coming
Not coming with you. Come on

1183
02:04:14,710 --> 02:04:15,840
Give up

1184
02:04:21,970 --> 02:04:25,140
Vanu they will put me in jail for harashment case
please don't make big scene

1185
02:04:42,190 --> 02:04:43,380
What happened, Vanu?

1186
02:04:43,930 --> 02:04:45,040
Vanu, Why are you crying?

1187
02:04:45,170 --> 02:04:49,090
you should go to jail for harashment case

1188
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:54,510
Whenever this country gets to this country
I did not even look at it as a human being

1189
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:57,060
What I was doing
Why are you so angry?

1190
02:04:57,710 --> 02:04:58,970
you are taking revenge?

1191
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:02,730
Not revenge
It's your right

1192
02:05:03,950 --> 02:05:05,230
I have a problem

1193
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:08,130
That's trying to get away from you?

1194
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:16,100
Do not do anything with any work
No one with whom I am dating. Not even working

1195
02:05:16,710 --> 02:05:18,160
Mentally
not Physically also

1196
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:23,160
When I was trying, you came back

1197
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:24,750
Think about my situation

1198
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:31,220
I look at your eyelids talking
Do you know why?

1199
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:35,500
Willing about you

1200
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:39,530
That's the village

1201
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:41,500
That's the village

1202
02:05:42,120 --> 02:05:42,900
That tractor

1203
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:44,030
You

1204
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:47,130
I'm still bouncing in front of my eyes

1205
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:51,300
I like you very much
so many

1206
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:05,100
And we can be friends

1207
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:06,260
Can not?

1208
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:09,800
You are happy

1209
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,240
I will bear my grief

1210
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:14,650
let's be friend

1211
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,000
Are you seeing my country?

1212
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:26,360
I mean, you showed me the village
Like that
1,322
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:16,830
show me your would be's photo

1213
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,600
I'll go with you

1214
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:56,000
What are you especially asking?

1215
02:08:57,460 --> 02:08:58,280
You like it?

1216
02:09:04,530 --> 02:09:05,030
Brother

1217
02:09:06,290 --> 02:09:07,650
What are you doing right now?

1218
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:10,730
You see. Morning
Joke. Where is Vamsi?

1219
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:14,390
Come on, come on. Hey guys
How are you?

1220
02:09:18,650 --> 02:09:20,850
Your sisters are married
Our two got married?

1221
02:09:23,240 --> 02:09:25,230
Akka's marriage is
Because of the room

1222
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:30,760
We spoke in the room that day
I sent a visa .....

1223
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:33,340
It was planned

1224
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:34,780
That's right in the left

1225
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:08,550
Now what's up with a sari?
Get outta here. It's just the rest

1226
02:10:09,190 --> 02:10:10,010
All together

1227
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:26,490
You sleep upstairs
I'm going to sleep here

1228
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:28,130
Not going to sleep

1229
02:10:34,150 --> 02:10:34,970
Say something

1230
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:39,880
I'll ask you something
Do not mind

1231
02:10:41,380 --> 02:10:44,790
sorry, thank you, love you
Are you not saying these things?

1232
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:48,000
There
According to the person

1233
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:52,430
are you a big doctor?

1234
02:10:53,130 --> 02:10:55,510
The doctor is not big or small
Only the doctor

1235
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:57,290
Mom's dream

1236
02:10:58,440 --> 02:10:59,920
That's why that was done

1237
02:11:00,820 --> 02:11:02,060
do you make hospital in India?

1238
02:11:04,330 --> 02:11:07,110
I have applied in largest university in America

1239
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:08,760
Waiting for the seat

1240
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:10,870
It's my dream to become a nuro sargon

1241
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:12,350
Is this a doctor?

1242
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:36,800
Varun
wake up

1243
02:11:38,630 --> 02:11:39,380
Vanu, where are you going?

1244
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:26,180
One thing is gone ... It's you

1245
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:40,400
Even if there is no distance between us ...
I'm wondering.

1246
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:54,680
That's what's going to be from here

1247
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:58,540
Not lovers
give it a try

1248
02:13:01,480 --> 02:13:03,840
I want to be with me
To my world

1249
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:05,570
From my side

1250
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,850
That's all I ask for

1251
02:13:07,810 --> 02:13:14,190
If she's my big one
Just one more minute

1252
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:15,610
It's like this

1253
02:13:16,850 --> 02:13:18,530
Quickly send me to the village

1254
02:13:20,350 --> 02:13:21,970
What did you think?
Do you?

1255
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:10,030
Do you still want to go?

1256
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:16,050
Three more months
Family stories

1257
02:14:17,180 --> 02:14:18,600
I do not go now

1258
02:14:24,110 --> 02:14:25,470
Do not you like it, varun?

1259
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:27,310
Can not you wait?

1260
02:14:29,710 --> 02:14:33,290
I'm calling because I like it
I can not stay with him

1261
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:40,770
I do not know. from me
Did not he ask how he was?

1262
02:14:45,350 --> 02:14:46,320
May I ask?

1263
02:14:47,650 --> 02:14:50,790
It's going to be half-empty
It will not be complete

1264
02:14:52,070 --> 02:14:54,860
She's supposed to be a big doctor

1265
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:04,590
In there conditions in love, Sister?

1266

02:16:31,160 --> 02:16:32,480
It's very sad

1275
02:16:33,470 --> 02:16:34,480
It's like wasting my life

1276
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:38,320
You are a good person
A special one

1277
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,980
I'm not looking
Take it easy

1278
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,020
Stay here

1279
02:17:11,450 --> 02:17:12,100
That's what I thought

02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:30,100
Your Passport
Boarding pass

1281
02:19:36,690 --> 02:19:40,740

1283
02:19:42,860 --> 02:19:43,720
No thanks, uncle

02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,180
I need to talk to Vanu

1285
02:20:00,430 --> 02:20:01,220
With Vanu?

1286
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:04,040
Go on, boy

1287
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:18,820
Why did you came?

1288
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:22,900
Why did you hug me in the airport?

1289
02:20:25,990 --> 02:20:27,840
Go back and see what?

1290
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:35,580
What is this?

1291
02:20:40,410 --> 02:20:42,730
You do not like him
you like me

1292
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:44,910
why are you trying to get married

1293
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:47,130
Why?

1294
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:49,910
Ohh correct. You're Vanumati
one piece

1295
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:55,310
You told me about 100 times
You like it. To make love
1413.
02:20:56,210 --> 02:20:57,800
How long for you
That you are waiting

1296
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:00,280
But the bride is not waiting

1297
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:01,480
remember

1298
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:04,100
Get married

1299
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:09,410
After that, even after that
You and I can do nothing

1300
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:12,930
Think about it

1301
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:22,710
I will hold it if I do not like it

1302
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:26,010
I'll bear someone else
Because that's your choice

1303
02:21:26,310 --> 02:21:28,860
Belief that you are happy
You're not happy

1304
02:21:30,060 --> 02:21:31,150
You can not bear it

1305
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:34,530
I do not admit it

1306
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:37,190
I do not mind lying to me

1307
02:21:37,890 --> 02:21:39,070
Do not fool yourself

1308
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:45,890
Is not she going to sleep?
Dad

1309
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:54,380
Hear something?
What happened, Dad?

1310
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:58,690
Dad would like.
Anyone could bargain

1311
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:01,890
I'm at home

1312
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:06,580
This guys is thinking of getting married

1313
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:16,360
Having another person in your heart
I'm calling for a marriage not for me

1314
02:22:17,250 --> 02:22:18,440
I can not bear it

1315
02:22:19,300 --> 02:22:22,020
I'm not the only one
No daddy can not bear it

1316
02:22:29,010 --> 02:22:30,110
Even so far

1317
02:22:31,530 --> 02:22:33,110
If you do not marry

1318
02:22:33,580 --> 02:22:34,820
I'm gnawing, daughter

1319
02:22:35,960 --> 02:22:38,300
My baby

02:22:39,290 --> 02:22:40,350

1322
02:22:44,270 --> 02:22:45,150
Will you?

1323
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,980
My darling daughter

1324
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:48,790
Listen to your dad

1325
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:39,100
What's wrong?

1326
02:23:40,480 --> 02:23:42,760
Whatever I thought
But she's different

1327
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:49,970
Our Great Things Become Numerous

1328
02:23:50,770 --> 02:23:51,310
You're right

1329
02:23:53,020 --> 02:23:57,430
In one place. grow up
Get married. Somewhere else will go

1330
02:23:58,990 --> 02:24:01,000
That's what
You are. I was

1331
02:24:04,690 --> 02:24:07,140
What is this?
No need

1332
02:24:07,310 --> 02:24:08,520
You do not need anything

1333
02:24:09,060 --> 02:24:13,730
Your royal girlfriend came out of here
But I'm not going with you

1334
02:24:14,270 --> 02:24:19,680
With you for yourself
You're right

1335
02:24:22,270 --> 02:24:22,810
Really?

1336
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:24,590
Really?

1337
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:28,230
Over

1338
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:51,900
Sister, I'm not going to America

1339
02:25:12,900 --> 02:25:13,670
What happened Vanu?

1340
02:25:14,170 --> 02:25:17,930
Why are you crying?
Pick up

1341
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,950
What is this?

1342
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:27,580
Did you come for me?
Is this how?

1343
02:25:31,090 --> 02:25:32,090
did not understand

1344
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:34,630
It's grieving
Sorry

1345
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:36,660
Do you think so?

1346
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:38,910
Just say it once

1347
02:25:39,610 --> 02:25:43,380
The world said. If you're okay
That's my world

1348
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:47,720
You're my only one
What am I the only one?

1349
02:25:47,930 --> 02:25:49,930
You're my only one
My husband

1350
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:06,900
Can you see that sling?
It's our hospital behind

1351
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:17,460
No matter what
No Kiss

1352
02:26:17,610 --> 02:26:18,110

1353
02:26:18,330 --> 02:26:18,830

1354
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:23,480
This is the same personality
Alli did this

1355
02:26:23,830 --> 02:26:25,220
I do not believe
Tell him to come

1356
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:27,960
Is not your head good?

1357
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:31,120
Vanumati. is it?
Let me tell you
