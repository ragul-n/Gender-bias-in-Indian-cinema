1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:05,716
Ever since the terrorists have
started using mobile phones...

3
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:08,918
we have developed a new software,
from the security point of view

4
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:14,573
It has been fed into this system

5
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:17,900
Whenever words like murder, rape,
RDX or bombs are associated...

6
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,932
with the names of VIPs, their number
will be flashed on this immediately

7
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,589
I've noticed objectionable words being
used several times since this morning...

8
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:31,581
on this number.
On whose name is the number registered?

9
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,200
We've checked the records
of the cell-phone operator

10
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,235
The name and address are fakes.
- Naturally

11
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,689
The cell-phone company wants
to sell its services...

12
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,059
whether it's a tourist
or a terrorist

13
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,427
Switch on the location
identification system

14
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:48,631
Tell me where the cell-phone user is
right now

15
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:56,073
The caller is at the poolside
of Hotel Sunshine

16
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:59,982
Keep me posted on
every movement of his

17
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:23,933
Your cell-phone was out of range, sir.
- I'm at the poolside now. Go on

18
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:29,347
That cell-phone is now
out of range, sir

19
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:44,026
He's in room number 204
of the same hotel

20
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:58,033
There's no one in the room, Mike.
- Our system still shows...

21
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:04,028
that the cellphone is in room 204

22
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,041
Akram Shaikh,
you will always lag behind

23
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,988
So they knew we've
been following them

24
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:23,731
I found this map of Mumbai
from the bedroom

25
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:32,049
This looks like L sir.
- L...? Could also be 7

26
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:37,579
What's with L or 7 that the terrorists
could target in Mumbai?

27
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:42,318
7-ways, 7-bungalows...?

28
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,564
Lamington Road, Lokhandwala,
Linking Road...?

29
00:06:55,376 --> 00:07:01,413
Which means, one of the three
is a woman

30
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:17,256
Mr Dara, they're here

31
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,790
Only we brothers have
the right to search her

32
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,913
Many happy returns
of the day, Mr Dara

33
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:24,864
You turn 60 today and there will
be a grand party this evening

34
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:28,064
But we regret,
we will not be able to attend

35
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:31,850
So we thought of personally
wishing you on your birthday

36
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,384
You are a father-figure to us

37
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:38,669
The Godfather in the business
of arms-running

38
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:43,990
Please accept your birthday gift

39
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,569
You're the one who has it, right?
- Strange!

40
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,024
How would it be with me?
It's with you!

41
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,976
But you were supposed to carry it!
- Rubbish. It was you...

42
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:54,846
No, no. It's not okay.
- We must give you the gift

43
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:13,271
I had to make you
belong to me...

44
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:20,472
this meeting was just a pretext

45
00:10:25,414 --> 00:10:29,405
I wanted to
steal your heart...

46
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:32,442
this meeting
was just a pretext

47
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,932
Apocalypse...

48
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:43,426
I spell apocalypse

49
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:27,041
I haven't slept
many nights... '

50
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:30,824
you are the one
I've been thinking about

51
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:34,857
I've even touched it...

52
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:38,351
your body's as clear
as crystal

53
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,379
A spell I wanted to cast...

54
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:50,118
this meeting
was just a pretext

55
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:53,986
I wanted to
steal your heart...

56
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:58,020
this meeting
was just a pretext

57
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:01,928
Apocalypse...

58
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,837
I spell apocalypse

59
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:09,081
Apocalypse...

60
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:15,908
you spell apocalypse

61
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,874
In your arms,
I want to live...

62
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,409
On your eyes,
I want to be drunk

63
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:57,276
The redness of my lips...

64
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,935
I have preserved only for you

65
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:07,963
I wished to drive you mad...

66
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,623
this meeting
was just an excuse

67
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,947
I wanted to
steal your heart...

68
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:19,441
this meeting
was just a pretext

69
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:24,431
Apocalypse...

70
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:28,380
you spell apocalypse

71
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:31,957
Apocalypse...

72
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:38,492
I spell apocalypse

73
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:33,500
You've already killed, Dara

74
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:36,868
However, children...
times are bad

75
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:42,400
I have news from the CBI that one
Akram Shaikh is hot on your trail

76
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,891
He'll always keep trailing.
- In missiles and arms...

77
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,257
we've gone too far ahead anyway.
- If you get caught...

78
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,333
I won't remain the Home Minister
anymore. Do you understand that?

79
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:58,243
If this deal goes through, you will
become the Chief Minister, Uncle

80
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:05,735
Don't call me Uncle, okay?

81
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:11,723
You're very mischievous. Now tell me.
What are you doing about Akram Shaikh?

82
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,103
Did that hurt?

83
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,874
I'll tell you!

84
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:39,411
Ali, Abbas...
- Damn it, Suresh-bhai!

85
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:44,773
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why do
you provoke violence in Gandhi's land?

86
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:52,923
Has he told you something?

87
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:56,127
A police beating is quite
something else, sir

88
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:02,287
Even the mute start singing

89
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:04,485
My suspicion was right, sir

90
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:07,601
Small-time thieves four years ago,
Ali and Abbas...

91
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:10,762
are today's biggest arms-dealers

92
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:14,963
Ever since America is keeping
a vigil on other countries...

93
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:18,664
these terrorists want to turn India
into a marketplace for firearms

94
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:26,114
We will not let India get a bad name
in the rest of the world

95
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:31,097
You are now in-charge of the case

96
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:35,838
Sir, Dara's murder, the seizure
of the map from the hotel room...

97
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,913
I don't know why,
but I feel...

98
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:45,526
that there's a storm in the offing.
The city's under threat, sir

99
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:59,334
We've been after Dara for so
many days for these weapons

100
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,823
And now we get our hands on them

101
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:08,358
What a figure!
Sleek and sexy!

102
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:11,807
We only need a virus now.
- Funny!

103
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:15,219
Not even the girls I promise marriage
every day are as suspicious

104
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:17,962
I told you,
you'll have the virus

105
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:21,495
In which case, the government
will go down on its knees

106
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:23,491
We can spell doom

107
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,819
How about making a call
to Brigadier Rashid...?

108
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,148
Our contact in the ISI

109
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:33,722
This cake in the shape of India,
in the flavour of pistachio...

110
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:40,001
in green! It's going to be fun
relishing it

111
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:43,744
Ali Abbas! Have you got
your hands on those missiles?

112
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:48,070
Yes, you need to help us now.
And we will help you

113
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,687
It's like this, brother

114
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:54,099
Every Muslim from the land of the
infidels finds shelter in our land

115
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:58,049
Anyone who teaches the infidels
a lesson...

116
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,374
becomes the King of the palaces
of Karachi

117
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,576
You must teach them a lesson too

118
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:08,154
The serial bomb-blasts of '93
are fading from memory

119
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,438
What Dara could never do,
we will do

120
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:15,554
Wow! Wonderful!

121
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:19,380
Take shelter from us.
And take the money from them

122
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:24,794
God protect you.
- God protect you

123
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:32,771
Mr Vajpayee wants peace.
And we want pieces

124
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:37,385
Pieces of India

125
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:42,960
Especially this one... Kashmir

126
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:50,944
Our virus will show such magic
in Bombay...

127
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,473
that talks between the countries
will collapse, even before they begin

128
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:03,417
This virus could very well become
a bigger issue than Kashmir

129
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:13,688
A delegation from the Defence
Ministry has arrived, sir

130
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:19,519
The director wants you to
brief them on the virus

131
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:24,583
Sir, these important files are
going to the U.N.

132
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:29,996
Please sign them

133
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:43,129
How are you, Gopal?
- How should I be?

134
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,832
I hear you're going to brief a
delegation from the Defence Ministry?

135
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:51,530
You will go to America to do a research
at the director's recommendation...

136
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:55,023
and when you return, you will be
the join-director, sir!

137
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,140
How am I to feel?

138
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:04,379
I've worked all night and prepared
a progressive report on the virus

139
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:20,930
Our research team is being headed by a
young, brilliant scientist Rahul Gupta

140
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,659
The enemy every day warns
us of a nuclear war

141
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,110
He prepares chemical
and biological weapons

142
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:37,021
Our intelligence have unearthed
the information...

143
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:39,891
that the enemy has
developed this virus

144
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:43,884
If this virus is dropped in our
country through missiles...

145
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:47,917
people will suffer to death.
No one will survive

146
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,074
Air, water and land...

147
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:55,068
wherever this virus explodes...

148
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:58,396
it will affect the nervous system of
everyone in a radius of 10 kilometers

149
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:01,722
Our research team is therefore
preparing an antidote

150
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:05,590
An anti-virus, like the ones used
for Cholera and Typhoid

151
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,708
Should this virus
be mixed in water...

152
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:12,908
we're trying to develop something that
will prevent it from becoming poisonous

153
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:17,150
A virus as deadly as this one,
no human brain has ever given birth to

154
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:22,389
But our research-team has
made good progress

155
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,634
In a month or two, we will
succeed in our mission

156
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:50,207
I've even asked for Vodka today

157
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,619
Rahul, there's no one
in my house tonight

158
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,442
Why? Where has everyone gone?

159
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,434
Daddy's in Bangalore, Mummy's...

160
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:08,180
Dr Kalam is there too.
He's got a lovely lab

161
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:21,022
Tonight, I'm all alone
in my house

162
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:25,680
Now look, just don't be afraid.
Keep the doors and windows shut

163
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:29,672
Keep a torch within reach.
If possible, call Bunty over...

164
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:39,817
There's something I wish
to tell you today

165
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:43,143
What?

166
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:47,054
Will you marry me?

167
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:08,060
Sheetal, you...?

168
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:24,108
I've fallen in love

169
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:30,929
Something's happened to me, my love

170
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:39,786
In your arms,
my body...

171
00:24:40,784 --> 00:24:44,651
melts in the heat

172
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:21,910
Shut the windows, my love...

173
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:25,319
let me draw the curtains

174
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,183
Let's do away with the distances
between us, my love

175
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:36,173
A miracle...
has occurred

176
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:43,075
Something's happened to me, my love

177
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:51,559
In my arms,
your aching body...

178
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:56,591
melts in the heat

179
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:03,577
I've fallen in love

180
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:10,563
Something's happened to me, my love

181
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:19,254
In your arms,
my body...

182
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:24,410
melts in the heat

183
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:52,311
I'm leaving for the trip.
The boat's ready

184
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:56,386
You ought to have joined me, stupid

185
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:58,840
I've got work to do.
Some intense work

186
00:26:58,841 --> 00:27:03,290
I know your intense work.
Listen...

187
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:11,240
Listen, Rahul...

188
00:27:30,112 --> 00:27:34,103
I found the virus-ball lying
outside on my table

189
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:39,142
It ought to be in the safe!

190
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:49,995
Sir, Gopal was here last evening

191
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:55,810
This is the Elphinston Jail

192
00:27:55,811 --> 00:28:00,675
Many notorious criminals used
to be held here

193
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:04,667
And how were they brought here?
- Just as you were brought here

194
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,992
Mister, I'm the one she asked.
Why did you answer the question?

195
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:12,318
Because I know a lot
about this jail too

196
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,478
Maybe you do. But why
snatch my livelihood?

197
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:18,971
How will I tell you what
else I'm going to snatch?

198
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:23,006
This jail is surrounded by the sea.
No prisoner could therefore run away

199
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:26,331
How do you know the detailed
history of this jail?

200
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:31,072
I know of the things that happened,
and also what's about to happen

201
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:37,400
Please come... let's go
towards the lock-ups

202
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:46,042
This is the place where dreaded
criminals were held for years...

203
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:50,409
without any food or water.
You sleep in your houses...

204
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:55,024
with the air-conditioners on.
But take a look in these jails

205
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:59,348
You will learn a huge lesson!

206
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:00,638
I was only kidding!

207
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:05,753
I only wanted you to feel
what those prisoners felt

208
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:12,372
Take a look at these jails.
Maybe they'll wash away your sins

209
00:29:16,732 --> 00:29:22,228
May you be blessed
in jail!

210
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:30,960
Everybody's in...?

211
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:43,925
What's happening here?

212
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:46,753
It's the beginning of a game

213
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:51,287
You're the prisoners.
And we're the jailors

214
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,307
It's no use trying to
use your mobile-phones

215
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:04,801
We've jammed your
mobile-phones here

216
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,713
Who are you...?

217
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:09,375
I'm no guide.
I'm a scientist

218
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:15,661
And now starts a deadly game

219
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:28,253
We're holding you hostages

220
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:32,664
Till the government meets our demands,
you folks will remain here

221
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:37,528
We have no enmity against you.
But you must do as we say

222
00:30:37,943 --> 00:30:43,356
Get us out of here!

223
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:48,672
Surround the jail with guards.
Use the radars

224
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:56,164
At every entry point,
deploy motion sensors

225
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:19,403
James, what's this?
- It's a motion sensor

226
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:23,726
Whenever someone gets close to it,
our computers will alert us

227
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:28,218
And if someone even defuses it,
we'll still get to know

228
00:31:29,341 --> 00:31:33,996
You mean we'll get to know immediately
that someone has arrived?

229
00:31:33,997 --> 00:31:38,655
Where have you placed
the seven missiles?

230
00:31:38,656 --> 00:31:42,106
One's in the tower,
two in the library...

231
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:46,764
two in the ammunition room,
and two in the Portuguese room

232
00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:55,545
I've connected you both
to the C.M.'s phone

233
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:02,730
C.M., bad news for you

234
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:05,101
We've turned the Elphinston Jail
into a prison again

235
00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:07,222
What rubbish are you talking?
Who are you?

236
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:10,757
Don't interrupt. Talk only when
we ask you to. Go ahead now

237
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:14,083
Why're you asking him to talk?
- Okay, shut up!

238
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:15,871
You talk.
- Who are you?

239
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:21,910
You speak up again!
So let me tell you

240
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,520
We're madmen...

241
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:28,804
by the end, we're going
to turn you mad too

242
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:36,291
We've captured 213 tourists.
Including some foreigners

243
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,077
Who are you?

244
00:32:38,078 --> 00:32:41,447
Who are we...?

245
00:32:42,237 --> 00:32:45,273
Why? You want to get your
daughter married to them?

246
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,925
Even if you want to,
don't offer the guests any water

247
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:58,294
If they drink the water,
they're doing to die!

248
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:02,611
With our missiles, we have
targetted the seven lakes...

249
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:05,771
which supply drinking water
to the whole of Mumbai

250
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:08,848
Our missiles are carrying
not just explosives...

251
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:11,926
there's also the virus we have
stolen from the CDC Lab

252
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:17,334
C.M., if you don't meet our demands,
we'll let go of a missile...

253
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:21,780
and the whole of Mumbai
will perish with the water

254
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:24,817
Don't talk, C.M.
Just watch the teaser

255
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:28,641
At the lake in Goregaon

256
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:31,054
Full of emotions...

257
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:36,426
and cries of agony

258
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:49,192
Cancel all my appointments
for the day...

259
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,466
What's happening here...?

260
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:55,671
28 people are dead,
a child's suffering...

261
00:33:55,672 --> 00:34:01,001
tell us something, sir!

262
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:07,647
The effect of the virus

263
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:13,019
Take a look at this, sir

264
00:34:27,194 --> 00:34:32,690
I need samples of this water.
- Okay, sir

265
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:41,704
People have died
a horrible death!

266
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,741
We've seen 29 bodies today,
it'll be 2.9 million soon!

267
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:49,398
I'm glad they haven't contaminated
the air to terrorise us

268
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,602
They've only contaminated
the well water

269
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,921
One moment.
Call from Elphinston Jail, sir

270
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:07,402
15 billion and a ship
to get out of here

271
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:09,565
What?
- Aren't you recording it?

272
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,725
Listen to what you've recorded

273
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:16,593
You have 24 hours.
- I get it

274
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:19,920
You speak up again?
All right, go ahead

275
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:25,292
You must speak now and then

276
00:35:25,408 --> 00:35:31,939
As for what we can do, you've seen
a sample at the well in Goregaon

277
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:38,466
I'll explain. Until we have
sailed across the Arabian Sea...

278
00:35:38,674 --> 00:35:42,125
the 213 hostages will
remain with us on the ship

279
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:44,661
You're already using your brains...

280
00:35:44,662 --> 00:35:47,614
as to what you've got to do
in the next 24 hours

281
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:49,610
Tell him, James

282
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:52,980
Anything done within a radius
of 3 kilometers of this jail...

283
00:35:54,102 --> 00:36:00,013
will see our missile land in
the seven lakes of Mumbai

284
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:05,330
If you try to explode the missile
in mid-air, they'll no doubt blow up

285
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:08,947
But the virus will spread
everywhere in the atmosphere...

286
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:11,941
and kill all of you.
You get that?

287
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:14,977
24 hours... to doomsday

288
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:24,665
These criminals who have taken
over the Elphinston jail...

289
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:29,156
are they indeed capable of doing
something so dangerous?

290
00:36:29,698 --> 00:36:35,692
They are. Akram...?

291
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:44,384
Ali Rehmani

292
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,660
He found many jobs, but because
of his abusive nature...

293
00:36:49,491 --> 00:36:52,735
and his bad habits,
he couldn't keep any job

294
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:02,672
Abbas Rehmani

295
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:05,999
Like this brother,
very intelligent...

296
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,660
dreams of becoming rich overnight

297
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:12,570
The two of them deal in defence
equipment only in name

298
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:18,058
But actually, they're agents of
international arms-smugglers

299
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:23,047
Laila

300
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:27,706
Once the life of the discos
in Bombay

301
00:37:27,707 --> 00:37:31,448
She's the life of the
two brothers now

302
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,568
James Ricardo.
The gang's techno-brains

303
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:38,059
He used to work for the NASA earlier

304
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,427
Murthy, worked in an explosives
factory. Expert at explosives

305
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:48,588
Lop, a radar-expert

306
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:54,943
There's another thing. As smart as
they are in committing a crime...

307
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:59,558
they're equally adept
at wiping out the evidence

308
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:03,426
Which is why, we have only
information. We have no evidence

309
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:08,582
We have informers,
no witnesses

310
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,576
Is there no way we can
survive this virus?

311
00:38:11,577 --> 00:38:14,736
This virus spreads very quickly
in air and water, sir

312
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:17,773
In Mumbai, it'll spread faster
because of the humid conditions

313
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:22,970
This virus could perhaps be
destroyed with fire

314
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:26,254
We're still experimenting, sir

315
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:30,122
To begin with, alert the navy

316
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:34,655
Seal the area, 3 kilometers in
the radius of the Elphinston Jail

317
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:39,313
So that no vessel, whether it belongs
to the fishermen or the government...

318
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:42,639
goes there. Also declare the area
as a no-flying zone

319
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:47,629
Alert all the emergency services.
And please...

320
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:51,829
think of a sure-shot plan to
rid ourselves of this crisis

321
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:58,157
I'll go and have a word
with the P.M.

322
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:35,491
Why that smoke...?
- Reaction

323
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:38,152
O God! We must get the gas
out of the chamber!

324
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:41,230
Else, they can't get out either.
The gas will spread through the lab

325
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:45,845
The experiment has succeeded

326
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:49,588
Put the concentrate
in the test-tube

327
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:54,960
This virus can be destroyed
with fire

328
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:04,732
10 seconds more

329
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:16,701
We've fixed sensors and motion
detectors on all the ways to the jail

330
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:22,397
If the C.M. Acts smart,
they're going to get caught

331
00:40:22,398 --> 00:40:25,558
We've even laid
landmines everywhere

332
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,592
You've got to watch your step, Laila.
- What for?

333
00:40:30,714 --> 00:40:33,917
If you are blown up, we brothers
are going to be widowed

334
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:41,733
I hope you've marked the areas
where you laid the landmines

335
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:44,561
I want to live. With her

336
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:48,138
And I... want to die with her

337
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:54,590
Even if we die, we'll take
the whole of Mumbai with us

338
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,572
Any contact with the tourists' kin?
- Yes, sir

339
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:02,900
They have been taken
into confidence

340
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:05,810
What about the firebombs?
- The air-force's firebombs...

341
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:09,886
will burn everyone there
along with the virus

342
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:14,460
I hope that moment never arrives

343
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:16,955
How are we to attack them?

344
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:20,781
If their radar intercepts our bombs,
their missiles will all be fired

345
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:26,444
And Mumbai...!

346
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,887
There is a way, sir.
- Which one?

347
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:33,297
To get into the jail
through the water

348
00:41:34,087 --> 00:41:38,995
In the sea is a secret way, where
there are several other tunnels

349
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,485
One of the tunnels leads to the
septic tank in the jail

350
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:49,472
And there's just one man
who knows about it

351
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,302
But there's a problem, sir.
- What?

352
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:55,212
The man who knows about the way,
is serving a term in the Pune jail

353
00:41:55,628 --> 00:41:57,996
What...? How does he...?

354
00:41:57,997 --> 00:42:02,198
He's the only man who successfully
ran away from the Elphinston Jail

355
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,482
What is he serving a sentence for?

356
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:10,472
Murder. There are other
charges against him too

357
00:42:10,473 --> 00:42:13,175
You want to take the help
of a criminal like him?

358
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:16,502
Yes. Do we have a choice?

359
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:23,239
How will such a man pull off
something so difficult?

360
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:25,982
Hatred is an intense power, sir

361
00:42:25,983 --> 00:42:30,725
He was once a friend of Ali and Abbas.
He's their enemy today

362
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,584
Sir, call from the PMO

363
00:42:43,947 --> 00:42:47,566
How did you find out
so much about this criminal?

364
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:51,015
A man who can run away
from the Elphinston Jail...

365
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:56,090
is someone we must have information on.
Sir, please take a look at his file

366
00:42:58,044 --> 00:43:01,080
I've only told you about the hatred
he harbours in his heart

367
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:05,903
But the sentiment that
drove him to break jail...

368
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:12,398
was his love for someone

369
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:23,909
Loneliness everywhere...

370
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:27,900
somberness in the air

371
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:31,145
Her memories...

372
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:37,763
bring tears to my eyes

373
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:41,913
I breathe restlessly...

374
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:45,407
there's an ache in my heart

375
00:43:45,408 --> 00:43:48,444
Separated from my beloved...

376
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:53,058
life is no fun at all

377
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:58,299
She torments me so much...

378
00:43:59,588 --> 00:44:05,326
that girl I miss so much

379
00:44:13,435 --> 00:44:16,761
She makes me laugh...

380
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:20,005
she makes me cry...

381
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:24,995
she torments me so much

382
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:06,162
Sweetheart, beloved...

383
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:10,031
you are the one
I have loved

384
00:45:11,485 --> 00:45:14,478
Restlessness grips my heart...

385
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:17,848
what ache have you
given to my heart?

386
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:24,584
You are the one I have loved

387
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:34,564
You have stolen my heart

388
00:45:59,306 --> 00:46:03,756
The glance you cast,
robbed me of my peace...

389
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:09,453
your dreams
kept me awake all nights

390
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:15,274
A thirst for you
lingers on my lips...

391
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:20,971
what love is all about,
you have shown me

392
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:25,629
You have stolen my heart

393
00:47:18,938 --> 00:47:21,806
My feet no longer
tread the ground...

394
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:25,509
I've begun to fly

395
00:47:27,297 --> 00:47:33,659
Like fragrance, your tresses
are spread in the air

396
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:40,187
What spell have you cast?

397
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:50,709
You have stolen my heart

398
00:47:58,068 --> 00:48:02,227
You have stolen my heart

399
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:44,601
In your arms,
I must live and die

400
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:53,250
I have decided. You are the one
I will love without reservations

401
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:59,405
You are the one I have
taken as my beloved

402
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:09,966
You have stolen my heart

403
00:49:17,077 --> 00:49:20,488
You have stolen my heart

404
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:33,086
You're going away now.
- Stop me, if you can

405
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:36,288
As if you'd stay back
if I asked you to

406
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:38,451
I could even lay down my life,
if you asked me to

407
00:49:38,452 --> 00:49:40,611
Stop fibbing

408
00:49:40,612 --> 00:49:45,480
But I feel like talking with you.
All day, night, evening and noon

409
00:49:46,436 --> 00:49:49,927
Just talking.
- So go on

410
00:49:49,928 --> 00:49:55,665
Your deep voice...
it does something to my heart

411
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,154
So I'll keep talking. All my life.
So much that you'll be fed up

412
00:50:02,404 --> 00:50:05,439
You will call me from Mumbai,
won't you?

413
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,473
Are you going to think of me?

414
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:11,467
You're the only girl
I can never stop thinking about

415
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:13,545
The moment I've wrapped up
daddy's business...

416
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:19,000
I'll fly into your arms
from Mauritius

417
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:26,477
I'm glad you went away
to Mauritius

418
00:50:26,478 --> 00:50:28,807
There's no tension
with the police anymore

419
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:31,551
Everything's under control.
- Let's talk business

420
00:50:31,552 --> 00:50:34,671
Podar Seth's company has closed down.
- What happened?

421
00:50:35,836 --> 00:50:38,829
That which is happening everywhere

422
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,324
From Bikaner's bhujia
to Dehradun's basmati rice...

423
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:46,148
from potato chips to the
computer chips...

424
00:50:46,149 --> 00:50:50,846
multinationals are storming
into every trade

425
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:54,007
Why're you playing a socialist?
What do you want me to do?

426
00:50:54,008 --> 00:50:58,250
I'll explain.
Peter, switch off the music

427
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:05,401
Podar Seth needs a new formula of a
medical drug to start another company

428
00:51:05,817 --> 00:51:09,102
We've got to steal that formula
from a multinational company

429
00:51:09,103 --> 00:51:11,512
Why wait for me to pull off
something so easy?

430
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:16,711
You could've done it on your own.
- We couldn't have

431
00:51:16,712 --> 00:51:20,206
This company has a very advanced
security system. Ultra-modern

432
00:51:25,237 --> 00:51:27,398
The alarm will go off
the moment we pick up the floppy

433
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:30,060
The police will take 2 minutes
to get there...

434
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:33,054
but the security guards
will be there in 10 seconds

435
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:36,755
Only you can steal that floppy
and escape in 10 seconds

436
00:51:38,377 --> 00:51:41,536
The money?
- We've taken an advance

437
00:51:41,537 --> 00:51:45,528
We'll get the rest later.
- The most important thing...

438
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:48,565
you can't enter the company's
records room through the door

439
00:51:49,563 --> 00:51:54,809
You'll have to get in
through the roof

440
00:51:56,882 --> 00:51:59,918
from a height of 150 feet,
you will descend here

441
00:52:00,582 --> 00:52:04,783
The problem is: Laser beam traps
are laid all over the floor

442
00:52:05,906 --> 00:52:09,773
They aren't visible, but the moment
you touch them, the alarm will go off

443
00:52:10,395 --> 00:52:15,933
But these laser-beams can be
seen through a smokescreen

444
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:55,066
She makes me laugh,
she makes me cry...

445
00:54:55,067 --> 00:54:59,432
she torments me so much

446
00:54:59,433 --> 00:55:02,592
I miss that girl very much

447
00:55:02,593 --> 00:55:07,459
Say something... don't be quiet.
Just keep talking

448
00:55:08,955 --> 00:55:11,241
Your voice...

449
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:17,113
Forget about my voice
and heed my heart

450
00:55:18,104 --> 00:55:22,684
I'll come back soon

451
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:13,824
She makes me laugh...

452
00:56:13,825 --> 00:56:16,486
she makes me cry...

453
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:20,728
she torments me so much

454
00:56:33,578 --> 00:56:38,401
I miss that girl very much

455
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:03,891
He appears in my dreams...

456
00:57:03,892 --> 00:57:06,885
he steals my heart...

457
00:57:06,886 --> 00:57:10,753
he torments me so much

458
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:17,739
I miss that boy very much

459
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:59,947
The first time I saw her,
I went crazy about her'

460
00:58:00,695 --> 00:58:05,477
She acknowledged my love
and robbed me of my peace

461
00:58:08,595 --> 00:58:11,423
He's the one I could die for...

462
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:14,250
I'm not afraid of the world

463
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:19,490
It's his name I always chant,
as I sigh wistfully

464
00:58:19,907 --> 00:58:25,187
What helplessness is this?
Our love is yet unrequitted

465
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:28,305
This distance shall be
only for a few days...

466
00:58:28,306 --> 00:58:31,465
unite then, we must

467
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,500
He awakens the ache
in my heart

468
00:58:36,706 --> 00:58:41,155
I miss that boy very much

469
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:03,736
She makes me laugh...
she makes me cry...

470
00:59:03,984 --> 00:59:07,852
she torments me so much

471
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,508
He appears in my dreams...

472
00:59:12,509 --> 00:59:15,336
he steals my heart...

473
00:59:15,337 --> 00:59:19,870
he torments me so much

474
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:26,232
I miss that boy very much

475
00:59:32,344 --> 00:59:37,210
I miss that girl very much

476
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:08,439
I still can't believe it
that you have returned

477
01:00:09,728 --> 01:00:12,388
Liar! You didn't come to the
airport to receive me

478
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:15,382
Your daddy was coming there.
- So what?

479
01:00:15,383 --> 01:00:18,418
You could've met him too.
- In his presence...

480
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:22,909
could I have touched you like this?
- Strange guy, Ali!

481
01:00:25,072 --> 01:00:31,109
You guys... here?
- For a cup of coffee, what else?

482
01:00:32,058 --> 01:00:36,756
We're good friends of Rachait

483
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:39,251
Rachait, I must leave

484
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:45,455
Don't you like our company?
- It's nothing of the sort

485
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:49,814
Well...? Love?

486
01:00:49,815 --> 01:00:53,099
You didn't give us a proper
introduction to your girlfriend

487
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,589
We'd have said a few words
in praise of you

488
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:00,085
You've given that girl
the status of art!

489
01:01:00,086 --> 01:01:02,579
Looks like you haven't told her
what you do for a living

490
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,990
Every time I told a girl,
she fled!

491
01:01:09,442 --> 01:01:13,933
Love makes people talk.
And you've fallen silent

492
01:01:14,515 --> 01:01:18,672
Let's talk business

493
01:01:18,673 --> 01:01:23,121
It's going to be very crowded there,
there will be a lot of securitymen

494
01:01:23,122 --> 01:01:25,575
And the party's being held
on the 20th floor

495
01:01:25,576 --> 01:01:31,480
It's impossible for us
to escape from there

496
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:34,515
What's gotten into you?

497
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:37,967
I'm not in the mood.
- Where are you going?

498
01:01:37,968 --> 01:01:41,460
Moods don't run the business.
- I'm not in the mood, I told you

499
01:01:41,461 --> 01:01:44,454
I don't want to do it.
- Relax, Ali

500
01:01:44,455 --> 01:01:49,867
Let's talk about it later

501
01:01:50,484 --> 01:01:54,891
Something surely is fishy.
- Isn't there?

502
01:01:54,892 --> 01:01:56,513
It's his girlfriend

503
01:01:56,514 --> 01:02:00,505
You're through with talking, Rachait?

504
01:02:00,506 --> 01:02:03,791
And you said you could
go on all your life

505
01:02:04,498 --> 01:02:09,654
Well, Mr Silent...?
What's up?

506
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:13,689
Sapna, I carry a burden
on my heart

507
01:02:14,645 --> 01:02:18,803
So give it to me.
Your burden and your sorrows

508
01:02:33,523 --> 01:02:37,057
I am a criminal

509
01:02:37,058 --> 01:02:40,384
Ever since I was a child,
I have been a thief

510
01:02:47,537 --> 01:02:52,942
But I'm not using my poverty
and helplessness as an excuse

511
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:59,554
I'm just a thief

512
01:02:59,555 --> 01:03:04,627
Maybe you've become quiet
because you hear me say this

513
01:03:04,628 --> 01:03:08,743
Maybe you'll go far away from me
in just a moment or two

514
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:13,900
I'm afraid to turn around and see.
Even if you have walked away...

515
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:20,886
I won't hold you guilty.
But if you're still with me...

516
01:03:22,217 --> 01:03:27,457
I promise, I will give up
everything. Everything.

517
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:41,228
Promise?

518
01:03:47,668 --> 01:03:51,159
I've made up my mind.
I'm giving up all this

519
01:03:52,616 --> 01:03:57,522
Is that your decision...?
Or is it hers?

520
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:07,957
If you're in love, get married.
That's a nice thing

521
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:11,244
We'll dance at your wedding.
But there's a problem

522
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:15,153
If one of us commits the theft,
he won't be able to escape

523
01:04:15,736 --> 01:04:21,099
He'll get caught. And if he tattles
on the names of anyone of us...

524
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,801
the police could come
to your house too

525
01:04:23,802 --> 01:04:26,088
Your family will be ruined
before it's made

526
01:04:26,089 --> 01:04:28,999
That's just what we don't want!
- Now look...

527
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,906
the necklace is worth 50 million.
Do it one last time

528
01:04:34,822 --> 01:04:38,937
Once we have the money,
we'll give up this profession too

529
01:04:38,938 --> 01:04:44,601
We'll also get married

530
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:56,079
The last time...?
- Of course. The last time!

531
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,557
I'm glad he agreed.
- Have you told him...

532
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:07,090
the necklace has a computer chip
with the army's secrets in it?

533
01:05:07,091 --> 01:05:09,627
As is he'd have agreed then!

534
01:05:09,628 --> 01:05:14,118
Before the chip is delivered to
anyone else, it'll fall in our hands

535
01:05:15,366 --> 01:05:19,192
And we'll sell it to the ISI
at any price we wish

536
01:05:19,731 --> 01:05:23,764
But the goose that lays the golden eggs
is slipping out of our hands

537
01:05:23,765 --> 01:05:27,592
It won't.
- Sapna will not be true for him

538
01:05:45,804 --> 01:05:49,712
You have a beautiful necklace

539
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:55,250
What business are you into?
- I run a diamond business

540
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:13,334
By the way, I don't dance
with just about anyone

541
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:02,816
In which case, you will remember
me for a long time to come

542
01:07:02,817 --> 01:07:08,977
People think of me
after I'm gone away

543
01:07:14,793 --> 01:07:17,828
Out with the necklace

544
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:23,575
Out with the necklace

545
01:07:30,594 --> 01:07:33,713
You wanted to give the ISI classified
information about the Indian army!

546
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:41,372
Bring these three guys along.
Move it

547
01:08:44,905 --> 01:08:49,105
Why do your friends Ali and Abbas
want to kill me?

548
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:06,902
Take the body to the hospital

549
01:09:06,903 --> 01:09:11,267
Have him charged under TADA and locked
away in the Elphinston Jail forever

550
01:09:11,268 --> 01:09:15,717
He'll rot in exile

551
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:21,381
We have another request. Our names
mustn't be dragged into this case

552
01:09:32,934 --> 01:09:36,094
This is the Elphinston Jail

553
01:09:36,967 --> 01:09:40,459
In the last 150 years, not one prisoner
has been able to run away from here

554
01:09:44,368 --> 01:09:49,983
I see a rebellion in your eyes.
But your lips are sealed

555
01:09:54,058 --> 01:09:57,299
Maybe the onslaught of time
has turned you dumb

556
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:02,832
And we have now clipped your wings.
Don't ever try to escape from here

557
01:10:03,622 --> 01:10:06,532
You'll either drop dead
on the ground...

558
01:10:06,533 --> 01:10:12,943
or drown in the sea.
Understand?

559
01:10:24,538 --> 01:10:29,069
He ran away!
In just 2 months

560
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:34,692
I know where he must've gone

561
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:14,984
Forgive me, although we
don't know each other...

562
01:12:15,524 --> 01:12:18,976
I do know of the love
that lies hidden in your heart

563
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:25,586
For Rachait

564
01:12:25,587 --> 01:12:28,997
I think of the immense love
he must've had for you...

565
01:12:29,454 --> 01:12:31,574
to lose his balance of mind

566
01:12:31,575 --> 01:12:34,527
I don't want to listen
to anything about him

567
01:12:34,528 --> 01:12:36,606
You may leave

568
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:41,638
I have nothing to do with people
who break their promises

569
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:45,340
Please don't say that.
I need your help

570
01:12:45,963 --> 01:12:49,289
I don't meet anyone.
- I know...

571
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:52,449
you're dead, as far as
the world is concerned

572
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:55,817
Because you're from the CBI,
I was compelled to...

573
01:12:55,818 --> 01:12:59,686
That's exactly why
you must go to Rachait with me

574
01:13:03,137 --> 01:13:06,255
No

575
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,209
He won't turn you down

576
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:10,663
And we desperately need him
in this mission

577
01:13:10,664 --> 01:13:13,866
I'm dead for him!
- But he's dying every moment...

578
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:16,817
with your memories.
- So tell him...

579
01:13:16,818 --> 01:13:21,766
to light a pyre of the memories.
- Even the smoke from the pyre...

580
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:25,383
will be that of your love.
Come with me just once

581
01:13:25,384 --> 01:13:29,667
Let him see that you're alive.
He'll come back to life...

582
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:35,032
and our mission will be successful.
- Sorry, I can't help you

583
01:13:36,487 --> 01:13:40,064
I implore you in the name of
someone you must ever have loved

584
01:13:40,604 --> 01:13:45,218
You will never tell him
that I'm alive

585
01:13:45,219 --> 01:13:51,456
Did you have to implore me
in someone's name...?

586
01:13:51,457 --> 01:13:55,823
Although she's no more...
my love for her is still alive

587
01:13:57,195 --> 01:14:00,272
And here, although she's alive...

588
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:05,014
the poor man thinks
his beloved is dead

589
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,612
Why're you wasting your time
over such a man?

590
01:14:17,613 --> 01:14:20,106
He's lost to himself.
What use will you have for him?

591
01:14:20,107 --> 01:14:23,934
I want to take a chance, jailer.
- Why take a chance for a man...

592
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:29,255
who's alive just by chance?
- What does that mean?

593
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:33,706
Every 12 hours, the man drops dead.
- Dead?

594
01:14:35,327 --> 01:14:38,488
Yes, every 12 hours, he suffers a fit

595
01:14:39,694 --> 01:14:44,101
He sees only shadows
everywhere

596
01:14:45,349 --> 01:14:48,050
He then runs after them

597
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:51,294
He assaults anyone
who comes before him

598
01:14:51,295 --> 01:14:56,160
Out of control some times,
he bangs his head against the wall

599
01:15:04,852 --> 01:15:08,345
So how do you bring him under control?
- With tranquilisers

600
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:20,985
Although these tranquilisers
affect his memory

601
01:15:21,485 --> 01:15:24,645
But he calms down instantly

602
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:28,968
What happens when the effect of
the tranquiliser has worn off?

603
01:15:28,969 --> 01:15:32,172
I didn't give him a dose, because
you wanted to question him

604
01:15:49,305 --> 01:15:54,676
Set him free

605
01:15:59,742 --> 01:16:04,697
Please leave

606
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:10,220
Everyone here thinks
you're good for nothing

607
01:16:10,221 --> 01:16:15,334
But I think you can be
of great use to me

608
01:16:15,335 --> 01:16:20,366
I'm Akram Shaikh.
From the CBI

609
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:24,441
Your name is Rachait, isn't it?

610
01:16:24,442 --> 01:16:28,559
You have two objectives in life.
Both of them...

611
01:16:29,474 --> 01:16:33,714
cannot be accomplished
unless you're out of prison

612
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:37,997
I can help you in
getting out of jail

613
01:16:37,998 --> 01:16:43,404
If you help me... to save
the nation from a crisis

614
01:16:44,818 --> 01:16:50,639
The Elphinston Jail...
does that ring a bell?

615
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:55,255
It's now a tourist spot.
But when it was a prison...

616
01:16:56,462 --> 01:16:59,622
no inmate could ever
run away from it

617
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:04,279
Except one man.
You

618
01:17:06,816 --> 01:17:10,725
In the waters under the jail, is a
maze of tunnels leading to the shores

619
01:17:11,764 --> 01:17:15,423
Only you know about them

620
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:18,417
You were the one who
ran away from there

621
01:17:18,418 --> 01:17:22,409
I want to use the same tunnel
to get inside the jail

622
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:25,403
You will go with me,
because...

623
01:17:25,404 --> 01:17:29,727
you will fulfill an objective
if you leave with me

624
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:33,055
Two men are holding 213 people
hostages in the prison

625
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:42,453
The two men are your friends.
The brothers... Abbas and Ali

626
01:17:49,563 --> 01:17:54,643
They've placed all the seven lakes in
Mumbai in target of a deadly virus

627
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:59,336
If their demands are not met,
along with Mumbai...

628
01:17:59,959 --> 01:18:05,656
they'll destroy the entire nation.
I know, it'll make no difference to you

629
01:18:06,904 --> 01:18:10,479
But if your enemies slip out
of our hands this time...

630
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,471
they'll have gone very far away
from your reach

631
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:18,879
You'll never find a better
opportunity of confronting them

632
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,664
Come with me and have your revenge

633
01:18:35,471 --> 01:18:37,799
I forgot...

634
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,041
your second objective.
Your love

635
01:18:48,487 --> 01:18:51,189
Love never dies, they say

636
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:56,388
And the way you loved her,
only someone in love can understand

637
01:18:58,509 --> 01:19:02,416
She left you and went away
to a world of her own

638
01:19:02,417 --> 01:19:06,784
But whichever world she lives in,
you will meet her some day

639
01:19:07,532 --> 01:19:09,611
And what will you say to her?

640
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:12,189
That you were a criminal
who served a sentence?

641
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:15,766
Won't you do something that will
make you rise in her esteem?

642
01:19:16,514 --> 01:19:22,711
So that she can say, no one has
ever loved the way you have

643
01:19:31,526 --> 01:19:34,894
you can fight it because
you loved someone too

644
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:41,098
Or maybe for the millions
who live in Mumbai

645
01:19:49,449 --> 01:19:51,860
No one can snatch
that right from us!

646
01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:55,768
We were born in a free nation...

647
01:19:55,769 --> 01:19:58,096
Hey little girl...

648
01:19:58,097 --> 01:20:01,757
you talk as if the mutiny
of 1857 has begun again

649
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:06,164
You're in the habit of talking
about the mutiny of 1857...

650
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:09,949
and the struggle of 1942, aren't you?
- I'm your guide, after all

651
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:14,564
You can't hold us back by force!

652
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:17,974
I love fighting girls.
What is your name?

653
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:22,298
Congratulations!
You have just won your freedom!

654
01:20:22,299 --> 01:20:24,336
Guards, open the door

655
01:20:24,337 --> 01:20:27,788
Welcome

656
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:31,031
You've won freedom only from them.
Not from me

657
01:20:39,557 --> 01:20:42,841
This one's been instigating everyone.
I suggest, you keep her separately

658
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:48,330
Lock her up in the old wing
of the jail

659
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:53,660
Who else wants freedom?

660
01:20:58,144 --> 01:21:00,222
Hey C. M...
- Who's this?

661
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:03,174
Your father!
- Watch your language!

662
01:21:03,175 --> 01:21:05,170
Watch your manners

663
01:21:05,171 --> 01:21:11,200
This is your mother speaking, son

664
01:21:11,201 --> 01:21:13,613
Call me a genius

665
01:21:13,614 --> 01:21:17,146
Haven't we turned the heat
on the whole of Mumbai?

666
01:21:17,147 --> 01:21:21,472
You remember the demands,
don't you?

667
01:21:21,473 --> 01:21:26,844
Ali, you talk to him

668
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:29,581
You remember the demands?

669
01:21:29,582 --> 01:21:33,407
150 billion and a ship to leave

670
01:21:33,905 --> 01:21:36,898
But who's going to give you asylum?
- There's just one nation...

671
01:21:36,899 --> 01:21:41,390
which gives asylum to
the criminals of India

672
01:21:41,391 --> 01:21:46,214
You have 20 hours to go

673
01:21:46,215 --> 01:21:51,005
Get in!

674
01:21:51,827 --> 01:21:56,528
The walls in this cell are very weak.
Scream, and they'll collapse on you

675
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,241
You look handsome

676
01:22:14,242 --> 01:22:18,026
Time turns you into a savage,
Time turns you human

677
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:26,050
We're all slaves to Time.
Because Time is all powerful

678
01:22:26,051 --> 01:22:30,543
Your face has changed today,
your clothes will change soon...

679
01:22:30,544 --> 01:22:36,287
maybe your Times will change too

680
01:22:44,972 --> 01:22:49,545
Never have faith...

681
01:22:50,626 --> 01:22:55,494
never wait

682
01:22:56,781 --> 01:23:02,146
Don't ever have
boundless love for anyone

683
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:07,675
Don't ever have
boundless love for anyone

684
01:23:26,721 --> 01:23:31,752
Someone is faithful,
someone is unfaithful...

685
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:37,532
who knows what misdeamonour
they commit

686
01:23:38,448 --> 01:23:43,812
In love, I have been
heart-broken...

687
01:23:44,271 --> 01:23:49,466
I have been deserted half way
through the journey

688
01:23:52,338 --> 01:23:57,245
Don't ever express it...

689
01:23:58,118 --> 01:24:02,816
don't ever wait for him

690
01:24:04,603 --> 01:24:08,139
Don't ever have
boundless love for anyone

691
01:24:10,466 --> 01:24:16,919
Don't ever have
boundless love for anyone

692
01:24:18,409 --> 01:24:21,611
My suspicion was right, sir.
The ISI has hatched this conspiracy

693
01:24:22,236 --> 01:24:24,687
I've received a report from RAW too

694
01:24:24,688 --> 01:24:27,681
ISI's Brigadier Rashid
is behind all this

695
01:24:27,682 --> 01:24:30,717
He's the one who tried the virus
on a few of our prisoners

696
01:24:30,718 --> 01:24:33,711
But our forces will give
him a fitting reply

697
01:24:33,712 --> 01:24:38,368
Go ahead and accomplish
your mission

698
01:24:38,369 --> 01:24:43,741
Hail India, sir.
- Hail India

699
01:24:45,397 --> 01:24:51,309
Akram, this is Brigadier Rashid
calling from Pakistan

700
01:24:52,383 --> 01:24:55,417
Quickly say what you've got to

701
01:24:55,418 --> 01:25:00,449
Let Mumbai go to the dogs.
You needn't worry about your job

702
01:25:01,698 --> 01:25:06,064
As soon as Kashmir is freed,
we'll appoint you the I.G. There

703
01:25:06,065 --> 01:25:08,975
Allah-willing, Kashmir
will soon be ours

704
01:25:08,976 --> 01:25:12,466
Hey Rashid, stop dreaming

705
01:25:12,467 --> 01:25:15,669
You've been fighting for Kashmir
for the last 55 years...

706
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:19,452
has Allah ever helped you?
No

707
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:24,693
You know why? Because even Allah
wants Kashmir to be part of India

708
01:25:25,733 --> 01:25:29,433
If not to us, listen to at least
the will of Allah

709
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:33,634
Because of Allah I have telephoned
to help a Muslim brother of mine

710
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:37,541
Why? Are there no Muslims
in Pakistan anymore?

711
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:43,323
Help them, Rashid miyan. And if you
think Pakistani's are not Muslims...

712
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:46,440
it's a very sad comment

713
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:50,143
But if they are and you
still want to help us here...

714
01:25:50,558 --> 01:25:53,677
people in your country will
call you a traitor, Rashid Miyan

715
01:25:54,093 --> 01:25:58,584
Not me! It's people of your country
that call you Muslims traitors!

716
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,535
Oh yes, there are
some people here...

717
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:04,487
who lecture us on patriotism
every now and then

718
01:26:04,488 --> 01:26:07,858
Like you lecture us
on Islam all the time

719
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:12,471
Now look, Brigadier.
My religion is Islam

720
01:26:12,472 --> 01:26:16,173
But my motherland is Hindustan.
And thus I salute Mother India...

721
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:19,958
the one you want to bleed.
Stop doing it

722
01:26:20,498 --> 01:26:23,701
Else, we'll teach you a lesson
the world will be left watching

723
01:26:24,157 --> 01:26:29,446
We'll finish you for good

724
01:26:32,641 --> 01:26:36,175
At Sunset, we'll reach the prison.
With high tide...

725
01:26:36,508 --> 01:26:39,293
we'll gain entry into the prison
through the secret tunnels

726
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,955
With me will be this
special force of commandos

727
01:26:41,956 --> 01:26:45,074
And also Rahul Gupta,
scientist of CDC

728
01:26:45,573 --> 01:26:51,900
He will tell us about the virus
that is loaded in the missile

729
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:03,079
However close you get to the missile,
whatever the emergency...

730
01:27:03,579 --> 01:27:06,863
do not even try to separate
the virus from the missile

731
01:27:06,864 --> 01:27:10,024
Which is why I'm going to with you.
And remember...

732
01:27:10,565 --> 01:27:13,558
the slightest bit of
carelessness on our part...

733
01:27:13,559 --> 01:27:17,593
could make the entire mission fail.
It could affect the whole country

734
01:27:18,549 --> 01:27:24,253
This virus is very dangerous

735
01:27:28,196 --> 01:27:32,063
The moment the mission is
accomplished, one of you...

736
01:27:32,563 --> 01:27:38,932
will have to light smoke-sticks
to signal us

737
01:27:41,586 --> 01:27:46,451
Akram, can Rachait recall something?
- He will, sir

738
01:27:47,574 --> 01:27:52,197
The moment he sees the model,
it'll all come back to him

739
01:28:13,605 --> 01:28:19,975
This is the jail
you were held captive at

740
01:28:27,827 --> 01:28:33,738
Try and recall how
you escaped from there

741
01:28:50,656 --> 01:28:55,362
Remember something?

742
01:28:59,347 --> 01:29:01,924
Officer, here are
Rachait's medicines

743
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:04,669
If he has another fit,
give him these medicines

744
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:10,415
He will calm down immediately

745
01:29:12,072 --> 01:29:13,983
Sapna, this is Akram

746
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:19,556
You didn't go with me to meet Rachait.
But I still want to thank you

747
01:29:20,263 --> 01:29:23,422
You haven't told Rachait
that I'm alive, have you?

748
01:29:23,423 --> 01:29:27,540
No, he still doesn't know
that you're alive

749
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:36,522
This mission is so dangerous,
there's no saying...

750
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:42,560
whether he will even return alive

751
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:48,332
Rachait did not betray you,
he gave you only love

752
01:29:49,371 --> 01:29:54,570
Because of that very love, he forget
the way to live... the way to speak

753
01:29:55,526 --> 01:30:00,190
Hail India

754
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:18,819
I have influence in the Prime
Minister's office, my child

755
01:30:21,974 --> 01:30:25,966
You guys have played a very big game.
Now listen carefully

756
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:34,614
Bad news. Akram Shaikh, with 10
commandos, is coming to attack you

757
01:30:35,737 --> 01:30:42,182
And there's good news too.
Your old friend, philosopher...

758
01:30:42,723 --> 01:30:45,926
is coming to you to be your friend
for a lifetime

759
01:30:46,799 --> 01:30:50,748
Your guide

760
01:30:50,749 --> 01:30:55,704
Be careful

761
01:30:58,775 --> 01:31:02,975
Our old friend Rachait is coming.
To fight against us

762
01:31:03,806 --> 01:31:08,471
Really?

763
01:31:08,505 --> 01:31:11,623
In that case, we must welcome him

764
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:17,028
Isn't it the Rachait you guys
often talk about?

765
01:31:17,029 --> 01:31:20,647
Before you finish him,
do let me take a look at him

766
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:26,801
No, no, no!

767
01:31:26,802 --> 01:31:30,210
Why not?
- Because he's a lover

768
01:31:30,211 --> 01:31:33,787
What if you fall in love with him?

769
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:37,529
The two of us will be ruined

770
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:40,774
So we'll first kill him
and then show you

771
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:51,169
The helicopter has dropped
the commando force...

772
01:31:51,502 --> 01:31:54,870
about 3 kilometers away
from the jail

773
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:58,322
They're now moving
towards the secret tunnels

774
01:33:02,942 --> 01:33:06,810
Sir, our commandos have got into
he Elphinston Jail

775
01:33:31,178 --> 01:33:33,589
The jail was made and
destroyed several times

776
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:37,954
I don't know which map
ought to be followed

777
01:33:37,955 --> 01:33:42,447
Rachait can help us only if
he remembers something

778
01:33:42,987 --> 01:33:47,352
Sir, our commandos have got into
the tunnel to the jail

779
01:33:47,353 --> 01:33:53,764
The cameras are switched on.
You can take a look

780
01:35:22,413 --> 01:35:28,408
Can you see something?

781
01:35:29,856 --> 01:35:35,727
Careful, sir.
There's a motion-sensor there

782
01:35:59,048 --> 01:36:01,791
They've left the tunnel

783
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:06,208
Stay here, Rahul.
And take care of Rachait

784
01:37:58,268 --> 01:38:00,346
Moron! Your government
sent you here...

785
01:38:00,347 --> 01:38:04,213
and you came along chanting
Hail India!

786
01:38:04,214 --> 01:38:07,207
When we set chanting out
Hail India...

787
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:11,492
we only return victorious.
- Not from here

788
01:38:12,073 --> 01:38:15,233
You'll get killed!
- If we die...

789
01:38:15,234 --> 01:38:19,059
scores of others will stand up.
If they are killed...

790
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,885
millions of others
will rise against you

791
01:38:21,886 --> 01:38:25,835
He's talking too much!
- Make a sieve out of him!

792
01:38:25,836 --> 01:38:29,371
Akram Shaikh, your death is
destined at our hands!

793
01:38:29,372 --> 01:38:33,073
And your death is also destined
at someone's hands

794
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:37,398
Not me, but the
One Above knows who

795
01:38:38,188 --> 01:38:41,347
We're the ones above!
Can't you see that?

796
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:44,008
Now beg for your life!

797
01:38:44,009 --> 01:38:49,255
He's down on his knees anyway!

798
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:27,465
Looks like they were told beforehand
about our commandos' attack

799
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:34,040
Sir, we've got signals
from the second camera

800
01:39:35,241 --> 01:39:38,400
He's still suffering.
- So let him suffer

801
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:42,185
Are you guys thinking of
shooting him? Here goes

802
01:40:04,308 --> 01:40:08,175
Do what you will.
You can't run away from here

803
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:11,458
We're not running away.
We're leaving...

804
01:40:11,459 --> 01:40:16,158
in a ship of your government,
like their sons-in-law

805
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:20,316
Don't you know
where we're going?

806
01:40:20,317 --> 01:40:23,851
Very well too.
There's just one nation...

807
01:40:24,473 --> 01:40:31,751
where every terrorist from India
is hailed and welcomed

808
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:41,480
You got it right!

809
01:40:41,481 --> 01:40:45,017
But that nation is a paradise
for Muslims like us!

810
01:40:45,473 --> 01:40:49,924
You're going to get kicked around
in that paradise you're going to

811
01:40:52,377 --> 01:40:56,660
Even in 1947, several people went
across in search of their paradise

812
01:40:58,033 --> 01:41:01,399
They were subjected to
a lot of humiliation

813
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,395
That's what's going to
happen to you too

814
01:41:03,396 --> 01:41:08,844
Whatever happens to us over there,
we hate the infidels in this country!

815
01:41:15,372 --> 01:41:20,030
Not Hindus, not Muslims...

816
01:41:20,031 --> 01:41:23,564
this country has a problem
with traitors

817
01:42:10,929 --> 01:42:15,294
I haven't killed you yet
because you're a Muslim

818
01:42:17,873 --> 01:42:21,075
If you want to live,
talk to the C.M.

819
01:42:21,573 --> 01:42:24,027
And make him give us
the 150 billion

820
01:42:24,028 --> 01:42:29,891
I'll get you even 1500 billion.
On one condition

821
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:36,336
Take all your friends with you,
whose faith is money...

822
01:42:37,126 --> 01:42:40,617
and betrayal, their profession

823
01:42:40,618 --> 01:42:44,320
Whatever faith or religion
they belong to

824
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:52,810
He spoke so much!

825
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:59,920
It's all over

826
01:43:11,889 --> 01:43:17,800
You're in a lot of pain,
aren't you?

827
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:55,926
All I regret is that I'm
leaving a mission incomplete...

828
01:43:56,883 --> 01:44:00,208
for the first time in my life.
- Nothing will happen to you!

829
01:44:00,209 --> 01:44:05,031
Nothing!

830
01:44:05,032 --> 01:44:09,023
Looks like God has called me over

831
01:44:09,024 --> 01:44:12,767
From very far away...

832
01:44:15,221 --> 01:44:18,547
someone's calling me

833
01:44:18,548 --> 01:44:22,206
I'm coming, my love...
I'm coming

834
01:44:22,207 --> 01:44:25,949
No! Akram, we'll be able
to do nothing!

835
01:44:26,157 --> 01:44:31,605
No! Don't say such things.
Promise me...

836
01:44:34,224 --> 01:44:37,634
you will leave only after you
have done what we had set out to do

837
01:44:41,251 --> 01:44:44,120
They are not the ones
who will bring doomsday...

838
01:44:44,121 --> 01:44:49,576
we'll bring doom to them

839
01:44:57,927 --> 01:45:00,212
Hey C.M.
You sent commandos here!

840
01:45:00,213 --> 01:45:03,082
I... I sent them
to negotiate with you

841
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:04,746
With guns in their hands?

842
01:45:04,747 --> 01:45:09,155
Their guns spoke, so did ours.
They're all dead-meat

843
01:45:10,069 --> 01:45:15,482
Now see what we're going to do!

844
01:45:25,871 --> 01:45:29,280
Rachait, they're going to kill us!
Get up!

845
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:32,315
They've got guns!
We could lose our lives!

846
01:45:32,316 --> 01:45:38,511
Do you get what I'm saying, Rachait?

847
01:45:38,512 --> 01:45:41,796
I was crazy to come here
to defuse the missiles!

848
01:45:41,797 --> 01:45:44,790
I've had my fuse blown
and you won't say a word!

849
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:50,329
Say something... react!

850
01:45:50,655 --> 01:45:54,479
They were here.
They've killed Akram Shaikh!

851
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,516
The one who brought us here.
He's gone away...

852
01:45:59,179 --> 01:46:02,172
and left us here!
What am I going to do?

853
01:46:02,173 --> 01:46:07,371
Oh yes! You remember the way back!
We'll go back the way we came!

854
01:46:07,662 --> 01:46:13,575
I can't even remember
a normal route, Rachait

855
01:46:20,761 --> 01:46:24,587
I've burnt Rachait to death.
His ashes will now flow into the sea!

856
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:31,247
Only his ashes will
escape from this jail!

857
01:46:31,364 --> 01:46:35,565
Sir, there's a girl called Sapna
who wants to meet you

858
01:46:35,856 --> 01:46:38,724
She says she has permission
from the P.M.'s office

859
01:46:38,725 --> 01:46:42,218
What am I to tell her, sir?
- Show her in

860
01:46:43,881 --> 01:46:47,249
There was a call from the PMO
that a girl wants to see me

861
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:51,408
She's the lover of the prisoner Rachait
who has gone on the mission

862
01:47:08,748 --> 01:47:13,404
Is Rachait all right?

863
01:47:13,405 --> 01:47:17,106
Yes, we're trying to
establish contact

864
01:47:18,063 --> 01:47:21,222
What does that mean?
- At the moment...

865
01:47:21,223 --> 01:47:24,758
those who have gone on
the mission, are missing

866
01:48:02,099 --> 01:48:07,463
What are you looking for...?

867
01:48:07,464 --> 01:48:11,288
Looks like the effect of
the medicine is wearing off

868
01:48:11,289 --> 01:48:16,702
He's getting the fits again

869
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:07,558
Sir, the scientist Rahul Gupta is
right before Lt Pradip's camera

870
01:49:16,034 --> 01:49:22,238
Switch on the beep of the wireless!
Tap it, please!

871
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:36,202
Who's this?
- Khurana. CBI chief

872
01:49:36,203 --> 01:49:40,403
Sir, how do you know that
I've got the wireless?

873
01:49:40,694 --> 01:49:44,560
The officer lying in front of you...
- He's dead, sir

874
01:49:44,561 --> 01:49:46,515
there's a camera fixed
on his shoulder...

875
01:49:46,516 --> 01:49:48,053
through which I can see you

876
01:49:48,054 --> 01:49:54,423
Remove the camera from his
shoulder and fix it on yours

877
01:49:57,909 --> 01:50:01,611
They've all been killed, sir.
Only Rachait and I are alive

878
01:50:03,731 --> 01:50:07,556
I know all the commandos
have been killed

879
01:50:07,557 --> 01:50:13,759
A traitor has leaked
information to them

880
01:50:22,111 --> 01:50:25,935
No, sir...

881
01:50:25,936 --> 01:50:28,597
The two of you can
complete the mission!

882
01:50:28,598 --> 01:50:34,011
Do not lose your nerve!

883
01:50:36,914 --> 01:50:41,828
There's someone standing
right in front of you!

884
01:50:45,065 --> 01:50:50,346
When death stares you in the face,
you have only two options

885
01:50:50,928 --> 01:50:56,466
Either surrender
or take him on

886
01:51:32,802 --> 01:51:38,382
Hurry up and get to Rachait

887
01:51:59,708 --> 01:52:05,078
Rachait! Get up!
Come to your senses!

888
01:52:07,067 --> 01:52:12,397
Only the two of us are left!

889
01:52:23,867 --> 01:52:26,694
It's very important for Rachait
to regain consciousness

890
01:52:26,695 --> 01:52:29,688
On him depends the success
of our entire mission

891
01:52:29,689 --> 01:52:35,933
But how are we going to sit here
and bring him back to his senses?

892
01:52:38,379 --> 01:52:43,493
Sir, I can help you

893
01:52:43,494 --> 01:52:49,822
I can have a word with Rachait

894
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:58,804
Talk to him! Go on!

895
01:53:01,749 --> 01:53:06,123
Rachait...

896
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:12,352
Rachait, this is Sapna

897
01:53:12,353 --> 01:53:17,426
Are you listening, Rachait?

898
01:53:17,427 --> 01:53:21,543
I'm alive, Rachait

899
01:53:21,544 --> 01:53:24,702
Nothing has happened to me, Rachait

900
01:53:24,703 --> 01:53:30,490
I'm here in the control-room.
Only for you

901
01:53:31,065 --> 01:53:33,768
Only for you, Rachait

902
01:53:33,769 --> 01:53:38,676
I went far away from you, didn't I?
I'll never do that again

903
01:53:42,126 --> 01:53:45,663
You can give me any punishment
you wish to

904
01:53:48,156 --> 01:53:53,021
But once... come back Rachait.
Just once

905
01:53:58,470 --> 01:54:04,665
I want to live again...
in your eyes, in your arms, Rachait

906
01:54:09,156 --> 01:54:12,482
I'll wait for you

907
01:54:12,483 --> 01:54:16,972
I'm going to wait for you

908
01:54:16,973 --> 01:54:20,217
I'll break every boundary
in my love for you, Rachait

909
01:54:21,299 --> 01:54:26,038
Stand up, Rachait.
Rise and destroy those...

910
01:54:26,247 --> 01:54:32,532
who have betrayed not just you,
they have betrayed the nation too!

911
01:56:14,904 --> 01:56:19,395
The CBI director says the two of us
can complete this mission

912
01:56:19,396 --> 01:56:21,016
There are three
missile stations here

913
01:56:21,017 --> 01:56:24,345
But which one is the closest,
I don't know. You'll have to...

914
01:56:28,792 --> 01:56:32,286
The General is very happy with you

915
01:56:32,287 --> 01:56:36,984
The way you have
finished the commandos...

916
01:56:36,985 --> 01:56:41,352
he has decided to reward you
with 5 billion rupees

917
01:56:41,892 --> 01:56:45,178
Thank you. Tell the General
that we will finish anyone...

918
01:56:45,386 --> 01:56:50,001
who stands in our way. Before the
Indian government makes another move...

919
01:56:50,293 --> 01:56:53,826
we'll put the pressure on them.
We'll scare them a bit more

920
01:56:54,326 --> 01:56:57,484
In a few hours, we're reaching
your country. God protect you

921
01:57:00,645 --> 01:57:02,974
Let me fire a missile on Mumbai!

922
01:57:02,975 --> 01:57:08,012
Only then will the C.M.
Send the money

923
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:11,333
Abbas, what are you doing?

924
01:57:11,334 --> 01:57:13,452
I'm going to put the whole of Mumbai
to eternal sleep!

925
01:57:13,453 --> 01:57:16,863
I only asked you to threaten them!
- I've said what I had to

926
01:57:19,318 --> 01:57:22,475
Gopal, let the missile go.
- Let's do it

927
01:57:22,476 --> 01:57:27,134
Abbas, hold it!

928
01:57:27,135 --> 01:57:29,670
Gopal, let go of the other missile

929
01:57:29,671 --> 01:57:32,706
Do what you want to.
I'm hurling a missile at them

930
01:57:32,956 --> 01:57:35,202
I'll kill you!
- Ali!

931
01:57:35,203 --> 01:57:40,574
Try killing me!

932
01:57:57,365 --> 01:58:02,737
That's Mumbai...

933
01:58:27,305 --> 01:58:32,760
Sir, they've fired a missile
from Elphinston Jail

934
01:58:47,765 --> 01:58:49,136
What have you done!

935
01:58:49,137 --> 01:58:52,921
What fear or bargaining power
do we now have!

936
01:58:52,922 --> 01:58:56,497
That C.M. Wasn't sending us
the money! He'll send it now

937
01:58:56,747 --> 01:58:59,406
We won't get the money anymore

938
01:58:59,407 --> 01:59:05,561
We've contaminated their lake.
All our efforts have been in vain!

939
01:59:05,562 --> 01:59:09,305
Have you gone out of your mind?
- You guys were out of your minds

940
01:59:10,095 --> 01:59:13,047
I kept my nerve.
- Kept your nerve, my foot!

941
01:59:13,048 --> 01:59:17,371
I let the missile go,
but I took out the virus

942
01:59:17,538 --> 01:59:21,114
I've fired a blank missile!

943
01:59:21,115 --> 01:59:23,567
So you fired a blank missile?

944
01:59:23,568 --> 01:59:27,518
Because the virus isn't a bullet
you can fire at will

945
01:59:27,976 --> 01:59:32,175
The virus is priceless.
It's worth billions. Like me!

946
01:59:35,295 --> 01:59:39,451
We're saved! We're saved, Laila!

947
01:59:39,452 --> 01:59:41,989
Gopal, you're a genius.
- That I am!

948
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:45,357
We are saved. Abbas, don't ever
do that again, brother

949
01:59:45,982 --> 01:59:49,897
Don't call me brother.
You fired at me!

950
01:59:50,139 --> 01:59:53,217
Out of love, brother.
Don't be angry with me

951
02:00:04,486 --> 02:00:09,898
You aren't angry with me,
are you?

952
02:00:15,506 --> 02:00:17,584
Let's embrace, brother

953
02:00:17,585 --> 02:00:20,204
C.M., do you see the power we wield?

954
02:00:20,205 --> 02:00:23,363
We wanted to undo the dhoti you wear,
not make you wet it

955
02:00:23,364 --> 02:00:26,566
Which is why we didn't load
the missile with the virus

956
02:00:26,567 --> 02:00:30,058
They had taken out the virus
from the missile

957
02:00:30,059 --> 02:00:32,054
Now tell us how many hours
you have left

958
02:00:32,055 --> 02:00:35,215
Eighteen.
- Wrong! 10 hours

959
02:00:35,216 --> 02:00:37,793
You tried to act smart
by sending those commandos

960
02:00:37,794 --> 02:00:39,373
So soon, how am I...
- Eight hours

961
02:00:39,374 --> 02:00:41,536
Listen to me, please...
- Six hours

962
02:00:41,537 --> 02:00:44,863
Four Two!

963
02:00:44,864 --> 02:00:46,026
One

964
02:00:46,027 --> 02:00:49,353
Want us to fire the missile?
- No, no!

965
02:00:49,354 --> 02:00:53,263
So let's settle at five hours.
150 billion and a ship

966
02:00:53,721 --> 02:00:55,882
Remember, we're really mad

967
02:00:55,883 --> 02:00:58,710
If you ruin our mood, we'll put
the whole of Mumbai to sleep

968
02:00:58,711 --> 02:01:02,662
Okay, I'll meet all your demands
in five hours. All right?

969
02:01:05,738 --> 02:01:08,357
What's happening, sir...?
They're dropping missiles on Mumbai?

970
02:01:08,358 --> 02:01:10,727
In the lake at Powai which
provides drinking water?

971
02:01:10,728 --> 02:01:13,389
I'm going to answer
all your questions

972
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:17,713
It was an exercise on the part
of the defence ministry

973
02:01:17,714 --> 02:01:20,541
Why didn't you inform the public
well in advance?

974
02:01:20,542 --> 02:01:23,410
Many things the press get to know
even before the government does

975
02:01:23,411 --> 02:01:29,614
How did you miss out on this one?
- You're the one who missed out, sir!

976
02:03:03,336 --> 02:03:08,749
I can't believe this is the place
they have kept the missiles

977
02:03:10,032 --> 02:03:13,233
This is the compartment in which
the virus is loaded

978
02:03:29,201 --> 02:03:32,236
This is where the virus is.
One mistake could ruin everything

979
02:03:47,747 --> 02:03:51,032
Here's the virus in its hyper
concentrated bio-chemical matrix form

980
02:03:51,033 --> 02:03:56,487
This is the deadly virus

981
02:04:06,709 --> 02:04:12,247
One down. Now for the next

982
02:04:15,775 --> 02:04:17,603
No one's responding
from the ammunition room

983
02:04:17,604 --> 02:04:22,976
That's where the missiles are

984
02:04:25,422 --> 02:04:28,623
Without this chip, they
can't use the missile

985
02:05:00,185 --> 02:05:05,598
Where are we landing?

986
02:05:06,298 --> 02:05:11,669
Follow them!

987
02:05:13,784 --> 02:05:17,816
Where are we going?

988
02:05:17,817 --> 02:05:23,812
Rachait, they're firing!
Do something!

989
02:05:32,829 --> 02:05:38,150
We'll meet with
an accident, Rachait!

990
02:05:38,151 --> 02:05:43,563
Do something!

991
02:06:26,055 --> 02:06:32,209
You, Sheetal?!
- Rahul!

992
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:37,290
You?!

993
02:06:39,071 --> 02:06:42,895
Sheetal, you, I...

994
02:06:42,896 --> 02:06:45,557
I kept calling you like a madman!
And here you are!

995
02:06:45,558 --> 02:06:48,301
They kidnapped me, stupid!

996
02:06:48,302 --> 02:06:50,547
That's all right.
But what are you doing here?

997
02:06:50,548 --> 02:06:52,876
I'm on a picnic!
I told you, didn't I?

998
02:06:52,877 --> 02:06:54,912
But what are you doing here?

999
02:06:54,913 --> 02:06:59,612
I... I'm here on a secret mission

1000
02:06:59,613 --> 02:07:03,313
You came to save me?

1001
02:07:03,314 --> 02:07:07,805
You came to save me!
My God!

1002
02:07:09,593 --> 02:07:13,251
Listen to me

1003
02:07:13,252 --> 02:07:16,245
Rachait, this is my girlfriend Sheetal

1004
02:07:16,246 --> 02:07:19,572
And this is Rachait,
a bit of a snob

1005
02:07:19,573 --> 02:07:22,983
We have very little time.
Here's the map

1006
02:07:24,563 --> 02:07:26,890
Two more missile stations left.
One in the library, one in the tower

1007
02:07:26,891 --> 02:07:30,093
Now which one is closer,
I don't...

1008
02:07:30,094 --> 02:07:35,457
Rachait is alive

1009
02:07:35,458 --> 02:07:37,619
Tell me something

1010
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:40,613
Why've you tied a red
handkerchief on your mouth?

1011
02:07:40,614 --> 02:07:43,817
Strange man. Neither does he talk,
nor will he let me talk

1012
02:07:45,646 --> 02:07:48,306
You tell me. Do I talk too much?

1013
02:07:48,307 --> 02:07:52,507
Oh no. Where do you talk at all?
- Exactly. I wonder what he thinks

1014
02:07:53,962 --> 02:07:57,164
That's a toy-gun, isn't it?
- You think it's a toy-gun?

1015
02:07:57,622 --> 02:08:02,993
It's a real one

1016
02:08:05,647 --> 02:08:09,638
Where are you guys headed...?

1017
02:08:09,639 --> 02:08:15,010
Has the money arrived?

1018
02:08:22,655 --> 02:08:28,068
Guns, missiles...
what's going on over here?

1019
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:32,301
Someone's coming

1020
02:08:32,302 --> 02:08:35,546
From behind, or towards the front?
- In the front...

1021
02:08:35,837 --> 02:08:39,204
back there, Rachait...
Where's Rachait?

1022
02:08:39,205 --> 02:08:44,902
Give me the gun and tell me
how it works. You go and stand there

1023
02:08:52,886 --> 02:08:58,257
Have you gone mad?

1024
02:09:16,547 --> 02:09:19,041
Rahul! What's he doing here?

1025
02:09:19,042 --> 02:09:24,454
He must be the one
who decoded the missile

1026
02:09:25,487 --> 02:09:28,938
Before he gets to the other missiles,
let's gun him down

1027
02:09:53,598 --> 02:09:57,089
Hey Romeo!

1028
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:59,917
What have you come here for?

1029
02:09:59,918 --> 02:10:02,829
Brother...

1030
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:06,155
I made a mistake. I ought to have
bumped him off with his Sapna!

1031
02:10:06,738 --> 02:10:12,483
I made a mistake!
A bloody mistake!

1032
02:10:12,892 --> 02:10:18,471
He has come here to die!
You stinking...

1033
02:11:25,248 --> 02:11:27,368
Laila, we've buried Rachait

1034
02:11:27,369 --> 02:11:29,447
You can shut the tunnel
from the other side now

1035
02:11:29,448 --> 02:11:34,851
So that they don't even
come across his soul

1036
02:11:34,852 --> 02:11:40,265
I've pulled out the pin.
Toss it at them quickly

1037
02:12:08,037 --> 02:12:11,489
What a bombshell! I must take her
out on a vacation!

1038
02:12:14,897 --> 02:12:18,309
We have either lost the signals,
or the camera is damaged

1039
02:12:22,217 --> 02:12:25,874
This is no technical glitch.
The two of them have been killed

1040
02:12:25,875 --> 02:12:28,288
When an officer like Akram Shaikh
was felled...

1041
02:12:28,289 --> 02:12:30,948
with outstanding commandos
of the nation...

1042
02:12:30,949 --> 02:12:34,774
what will these two clowns do?
- Mr Home Minister

1043
02:12:38,933 --> 02:12:41,926
Maybe you don't know my Rachait

1044
02:12:41,927 --> 02:12:46,625
He can fight any power on earth.
- That's your love for him speaking

1045
02:12:47,125 --> 02:12:52,115
Yes, my love possesses his soul.
And it won't let him die

1046
02:12:53,072 --> 02:12:56,813
There's no jail on earth from
which he cannot escape

1047
02:12:57,231 --> 02:13:01,222
History is witness to that

1048
02:13:01,223 --> 02:13:04,630
Rachait, they've blocked all the
ways through the tunnels

1049
02:13:04,631 --> 02:13:06,295
Come with us!

1050
02:13:06,296 --> 02:13:09,829
Shit! The path this way
is blocked too!

1051
02:13:14,944 --> 02:13:17,896
We're going to die here!
No one's coming to our rescue!

1052
02:13:17,897 --> 02:13:20,350
Why did you come here?
Even if I were dead...

1053
02:13:20,351 --> 02:13:24,343
at least you'd have lived!
Our love would have lived on!

1054
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:28,293
I'm suffocating!
I'm going to die!

1055
02:13:28,294 --> 02:13:33,665
Do something, someone!

1056
02:13:35,321 --> 02:13:40,651
Nothing's happening to us!

1057
02:14:02,473 --> 02:14:08,386
It's loaded!
I just loaded it

1058
02:14:13,204 --> 02:14:19,197
Gunpowder? What are you
going to do with it?

1059
02:15:10,214 --> 02:15:11,459
Rachait, go to the tower

1060
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:17,081
I'll meet you there after
I've defused the rest of the missiles

1061
02:15:17,448 --> 02:15:21,108
We haven't been able to establish
contact! What are waiting for?

1062
02:15:21,109 --> 02:15:24,267
Just pay them if you want to
save the lives of millions!

1063
02:15:24,268 --> 02:15:26,679
Dollars, Pounds...
give them whatever they ask for!

1064
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:31,006
Must we give you your share
or will you take it from them?

1065
02:15:31,420 --> 02:15:36,294
What?

1066
02:15:39,738 --> 02:15:43,064
Your pawn has told us everything

1067
02:15:43,065 --> 02:15:47,146
In any case, Akram had prepared a
pretty comprehensive file on you

1068
02:15:52,462 --> 02:15:55,497
Half an hour to go and the money
still hasn't arrived

1069
02:15:58,118 --> 02:16:00,195
Something is surely wrong

1070
02:16:00,196 --> 02:16:03,316
We're going to make the government's
plans go wrong now

1071
02:16:03,648 --> 02:16:05,643
Yes, everything is in place

1072
02:16:05,644 --> 02:16:10,342
We've made arrangements to jam the
signals of all tv and radio channels

1073
02:16:10,551 --> 02:16:16,164
You are the only ones who will now
feature on every radio and tv channel

1074
02:17:22,532 --> 02:17:26,399
Mumbai's under threat.
So is the rest of India

1075
02:17:27,189 --> 02:17:29,725
I'm Ali.
- I'm Abbas

1076
02:17:29,726 --> 02:17:33,593
In exactly 30 minutes, the people
in Mumbai will breathe their last

1077
02:17:34,008 --> 02:17:36,670
Because your government
does not care for you

1078
02:17:36,671 --> 02:17:39,789
If the government does not meet
our demands in half an hour...

1079
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,241
we will fire the missile at Mumbai!

1080
02:17:42,242 --> 02:17:44,570
The missile is loaded
with a deadly virus

1081
02:17:44,571 --> 02:17:48,480
Which will kill you and the whole
city, in a matter of a few minutes

1082
02:17:49,561 --> 02:17:54,468
Listen, halt the transmission of
all tv and radio channels immediately

1083
02:17:54,634 --> 02:17:58,917
Tell the cable operators to suspend
their services till further notice

1084
02:17:59,209 --> 02:18:03,117
It's such a deadly virus,
anywhere it is dropped...

1085
02:18:03,741 --> 02:18:07,733
not even an animal is born for
150 years, let alone a human being

1086
02:18:08,273 --> 02:18:11,932
213 people, we have...

1087
02:18:11,933 --> 02:18:14,427
Looks like the government has
blocked all the tv channels

1088
02:18:14,428 --> 02:18:17,421
That's all right.
Our job is done

1089
02:18:17,422 --> 02:18:22,336
Mumbai must've gone berserk!

1090
02:18:53,143 --> 02:18:58,513
Bloody bull!

1091
02:21:22,759 --> 02:21:26,792
Allah, Abbas and Ali
are blowing up Mumbai

1092
02:21:26,793 --> 02:21:30,827
As long as there is in Mumbai Haji Ali,
no harm can do Abbas and Ali

1093
02:21:31,283 --> 02:21:33,820
You're dominating every channel today

1094
02:21:33,821 --> 02:21:36,480
Thanks. It's all because
of your patronage

1095
02:21:36,481 --> 02:21:40,472
Even we have not been able to scare
the Indian administration so much

1096
02:21:40,473 --> 02:21:43,966
Get to the naval border as soon
as you have completed your work

1097
02:21:43,967 --> 02:21:48,839
I'll personally come
to receive you there

1098
02:21:51,118 --> 02:21:53,780
Come here, my boy...

1099
02:21:53,781 --> 02:21:59,650
they send a duffer like you
to stop me?

1100
02:22:10,954 --> 02:22:14,198
I told you, Gopal.
Never use science for destruction

1101
02:22:14,822 --> 02:22:19,568
Sure, but I hope there are
girls and beaches up there

1102
02:22:22,806 --> 02:22:25,964
I'll issue orders to the Air Force
to blow them up

1103
02:22:25,965 --> 02:22:29,042
I can't risk the lives of millions
for the sake of just 213 hostages

1104
02:22:44,470 --> 02:22:49,800
I'll stop him!
Go and fire the missile!

1105
02:23:15,492 --> 02:23:20,821
Ali, you fire the missile!
I'll deal with him

1106
02:24:30,217 --> 02:24:34,832
No, no...
you can't fire at me

1107
02:24:35,456 --> 02:24:40,238
The moment you shoot,
Ali will let go of the missile!

1108
02:26:33,095 --> 02:26:37,718
Let go!

1109
02:26:39,583 --> 02:26:42,867
Leave Abbas alone!
Else, I'll kill this scientist!

1110
02:26:48,524 --> 02:26:51,974
Leave Abbas alone! Else I'll kill him!
- Don't worry about me!

1111
02:26:52,307 --> 02:26:54,427
Kill him, Rachait!
- Let him go, I say!

1112
02:26:54,428 --> 02:26:57,796
I'm sick of these blackmailers.
They hijack planes...

1113
02:26:57,797 --> 02:27:00,165
explode bombs,
poison our drinking water!

1114
02:27:00,166 --> 02:27:05,871
Don't spare him, Rachait.
Kill him!

1115
02:27:12,184 --> 02:27:16,133
Laila... my Laila!

1116
02:27:16,134 --> 02:27:20,001
Laila has saved me.
But what happens of you?

1117
02:27:21,124 --> 02:27:25,325
You're going to your Sapna!
You're going to Sapna!

1118
02:27:26,987 --> 02:27:30,356
Kill that man and his brother!
Let me die, Rachait!

1119
02:27:50,897 --> 02:27:56,935
You really... really...?!

1120
02:30:19,434 --> 02:30:21,803
Bloody thief!
You're taking sides with the cops?

1121
02:30:21,804 --> 02:30:25,256
When it's a question
of India and Pakistan...

1122
02:30:25,257 --> 02:30:28,622
every Indian is on one side

1123
02:30:28,623 --> 02:30:32,407
You're in a hurry to go
to Pakistan, aren't you?

1124
02:30:32,408 --> 02:30:38,737
Your brother and Laila
wanted to go there too

1125
02:30:40,683 --> 02:30:45,639
You're going there too

1126
02:31:12,369 --> 02:31:17,534
They've given us a smoke signal

1127
02:31:29,543 --> 02:31:33,202
Bless you, dear

1128
02:31:33,203 --> 02:31:38,782
Any news of Ali and Abbas?
- No, sir

1129
02:31:49,089 --> 02:31:53,246
Dear citizens of Mumbai,
your Mumbai is whole safe now

1130
02:31:54,285 --> 02:31:57,403
The two terrorists Abbas and Ali
have been decimated...

1131
02:31:57,821 --> 02:32:01,728
their missiles and the virus
have been destroyed...

1132
02:32:01,729 --> 02:32:06,969
Mumbai is like the Mumbai of old.
Beautiful Mumbai, our Mumbai

1133
02:32:07,467 --> 02:32:11,965
Hail India

1134
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:48,974
Rachait is now a free man.
Go on. Live happily

1135
02:33:03,730 --> 02:33:07,764
Rachait, I made a grave mistake
in understanding you

1136
02:33:13,502 --> 02:33:19,206
I didn't keep my promise

1137
02:33:37,454 --> 02:33:40,697
Hold on! Wait!

1138
02:33:40,698 --> 02:33:44,690
Here's the scoundrel!
Why did you make a cripple out of me?

1139
02:33:48,141 --> 02:33:53,512
I only tried to save your life

1140
02:33:53,630 --> 02:33:59,916
He speaks! He can really speak!
