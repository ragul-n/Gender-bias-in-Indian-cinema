1
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,833
It's not right to go
to Mumbai over a petty issue.

2
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:17,000
We can sit and sort this out.

3
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,416
My parents don't listen, and only talk.

4
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:28,166
{\an8}Besides, I'm not going forever.
I'll return in some days.

5
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,125
{\an8}I allowed it, because you insisted.

6
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,250
{\an8}You were adamant,
so you choose Masters in Literature.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,333
{\an8}What's the scope of it nowadays?

8
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:41,583
{\an8}You have become obsessed with poetry.

9
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,000
{\an8}In today's life, only common sense works.

10
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,458
Your philosophy will make a joke of you.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,916
But dad, even you used to sit
and discuss poetry with me for hours.

12
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,458
If suddenly you have received
an NRI's proposal for me

13
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,875
you are making fun of me?

14
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,291
Right now, only this is good for you.

15
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,208
This was your opinion even when
Sis wanted to complete her education.

16
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,875
Now, separated from her husband,

17
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,916
the poor girl is staying here
with her kid for two years.

18
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,375
Dad, I don't know what is right for me.

19
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,708
But I do know what is not right for me.

20
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,291
And I don't want to get married now.

21
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,083
Neha.

22
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,916
Neha... Neha.

23
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,708
Come ma'am, please come.

24
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,208
Ma'am, actually this is my client's house.

25
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,041
He is out of the country for two months.

26
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,000
Whenever he leaves,
he puts up his house for rent.

27
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,375
Usually, he rents it out
only to married couples,

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,791
but you don't worry, I'll handle that.

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,750
-Yes.
-Thank you, Vijay.

30
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,000
-Ma'am, one more thing.
-Yes?

31
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,750
The rent is a bit steep,
but you don't have to pay any deposit.

32
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,125
Is that okay for you?

33
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,583
-It's fine.
-Yes.

34
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:02,458
-And Vijay, your commission?
-No ma'am, don't worry.

35
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,666
If you rent the flat for 11 months,
we will adjust it then.

36
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,166
-Alright. Thank you.
-I'll leave.

37
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,250
Alright.

38
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,916
Keep this aside.

39
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,750
-Sorry ma'am... the keys.
-Okay.

40
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,250
-If you need anything, call me.
-Thank you.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,375
Hello.

42
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,166
Neha, you planned
to stay only for a few days.

43
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,625
You could have stayed with aunt.

44
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,000
Sis, so many girls live alone.

45
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,708
Do they all live
with their uncles or aunts?

46
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,875
Can anyone win an argument with you?

47
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,083
Okay listen, is dad around?

48
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,583
Hold on, I'll put him on.

49
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,583
Dad, Neha wants to...

50
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:28,583
Dad has gone out,
I'll ask him to speak to you later.

51
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,583
Just say that
he doesn't want to talk to me.

52
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,875
Ma'am, have you arranged the deposit?

53
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,833
If you start looking now...

54
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,750
It takes time sometimes, you know,
to find a good house.

55
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,791
If I manage to find something
by then, fine,

56
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,750
or I'll be back to my hometown.

57
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,041
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

58
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,208
-Yes?
-What do you do here?

59
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
I mean, do you have a job
or are you into some business?

60
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,791
To do something, you need
to have mastered a skill.

61
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:09,041
And I am not a master at any skill.

62
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,958
-So currently, I am doing nothing.
-Oh.

63
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,125
Here in Mumbai,
everyone manages to do something.

64
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,416
It is difficult to survive here
without doing anything.

65
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,375
Ma'am, I have an idea.

66
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,416
Tell me.

67
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,208
Become an actor.

68
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,166
-Actor?
-Yes.

69
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,000
-Come on, Vijay!
-Ma'am you...

70
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,708
You are pretty,
you will get work instantly.

71
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:41,250
Well, thank you, but along with looks,
one must know how to act too.

72
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:44,333
And I cannot act to save my life.

73
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,333
So actor and me? Never!

74
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:51,083
Exactly, ma'am. I know so many actors
whom I'd rented flats to

75
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,125
and who now own duplex flats
within a span of a few years.

76
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,083
But I cannot act. I mean...

77
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,166
Ma'am, a client of mine is a photographer.

78
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,458
Why don't you do a photo shoot with him?

79
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,041
I don't know.

80
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,833
Ma'am, at least do a photo shoot with him.

81
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,708
You will get work instantly.

82
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,250
Nowadays, you have become very famous
on Facebook.

83
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,208
Sister, I was posting
my best poetry on Facebook.

84
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,791
Some days, three or someday four.
But yesterday,

85
00:07:56,125 --> 00:08:00,041
I post my one portfolio picture
and get 200 likes. I mean...

86
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,791
Nowadays, beauty matters,
not intelligence.

87
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,000
So right you are.

88
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,750
Listen, even dad saw your photos.

89
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:16,250
His friends were asking him
if Neha has got an offer to be a heroine.

90
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,875
Dad was laughing and
telling everyone.

91
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,208
-Is dad happy?
-Yes, he's very happy.

92
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,250
Yes?

93
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,083
I have brought veggies for you.

94
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,708
Give me a minute.

95
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,750
Sister, just hold on, someone has come.

96
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,583
-Yes?
-I had gone to Andheri station.

97
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,666
I got some veggies for you.

98
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,125
They are priced cheaper there.

99
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,041
-I thought I'll buy some for you too.
-Come in.

100
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,666
I tried calling you
but your number was busy.

101
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,541
-Yes, I was talking to my sister.
-Yes.

102
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,750
-Come, sit down.
-The vegetables.

103
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,750
Just a second.

104
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,375
Yes, Sister. Sorry, someone has come.

105
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,833
Look, dad is in a good mood.

106
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,791
Talk to him.

107
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,250
And talk to him nicely.

108
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,833
Tell dad I'll call him in the evening.

109
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,500
Alright? Okay, bye.

110
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,875
-Vijay.
-Yes.

111
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,708
Thank you.

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,750
So Vijay, what now?

113
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,541
I came to discuss that.

114
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,875
I have a friend, Manorama.

115
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,375
She knows many big shots in the industry.

116
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,833
-Okay.
-Let's meet her tomorrow?

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,875
Okay, whatever you deem is right.

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,375
-Fine, I'll talk to her.
-Okay.

119
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,750
-Hello. Manorama? Vijay here.
-I know. Tell me.

120
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,583
I know a woman, an actress.

121
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,708
I wanted you to meet her
for an acting role.

122
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,166
Meet me tomorrow
at 2:00 p.m. at the Coffee Shop.

123
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,625
-Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.?
-Yes.

124
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,666
Fine.

125
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,833
-Listen.
-Yes?

126
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,166
Is she good or bad?

127
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,291
-No. Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.?
-No, wait a minute.

128
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,000
Even the last time you sent fat women.

129
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,041
She is sitting in front of me.
She is beautiful.

130
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,500
-Shall we meet tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.?
-Alright.

131
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,750
You...

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,166
If you are so embarrassed in my presence,

133
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,750
what will you do at the shoot tomorrow?

134
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,208
It is an ad for underwear.

135
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,333
Only I will do the shortlisting.

136
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:02,666
Ma'am, I am not wearing any underwear.

137
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,750
She will be coming right now.

138
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,916
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

139
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:23,500
Neha, she is Manorama.

140
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,583
She's good. Very pretty.

141
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,375
She is heroine material.

142
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,958
I'll give you a number.

143
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,333
-His name is Raj, he's a coordinator.
-Okay.

144
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,375
Go and meet him today,
he's auditioning for an ad.

145
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,083
-Today?
-Yes.

146
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,500
-And Neha... Neha, right?
-Yes.

147
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,791
There is a party tonight.

148
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,875
Come, you'll get good PR.

149
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,416
Neha, shall we leave?

150
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,125
Send me message.

151
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,333
Ma'am... Come this way.

152
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,375
No, sir. Tomorrow, it will be done.
You don't worry.

153
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,916
The registration will be done tomorrow.

154
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,958
Don't worry about the flat. It's yours.

155
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,875
Yes.

156
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,750
Yes, sir.

157
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,750
Yes sir, I'll definitely get it done.

158
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,875
Sure, trust me.

159
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,375
Okay sir, we'll meet tomorrow.

160
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,583
Ma'am, how was the audition?

161
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,500
It was a miracle.
Just one look at me and they picked me.

162
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,208
I didn't even give any audition.

163
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,083
And they said the shooting begins the day
after tomorrow, 20,000 rupees per day.

164
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,000
Isn't it unbelievable?

165
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,125
Neha, it's just the beginning.

166
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,750
Please don't forget me.

167
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,750
When you become a celebrity,
keep me as your driver.

168
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,791
Now you're mocking m, right?

169
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,583
But I'm so happy.

170
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,541
Thanks a lot, Vijay.

171
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,291
In this busy city, nobody helps anyone.

172
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,666
But you helped me a lot. Thank you.

173
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't keep turning back and looking at me

174
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,791
You are so fair, who have you taken after?

175
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,708
Don't keep turning back and looking at me

176
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,208
She's Neha.

177
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:06,541
She is a wonderful girl.
Get her some work.

178
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,333
Hey, take a picture.

179
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,000
Your uncles are all dark

180
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:15,166
How come you are so fair?

181
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,416
Excuse us,
I want to introduce her to others.

182
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,791
Just two minutes, you dance until then.

183
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,375
It's Rajjo's baby showers

184
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,083
Mr. Ashu, how are you?

185
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,333
She's Neha, a new girl.

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,541
Take a picture.

187
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,708
Neha, he's Mr. Ashu, a very big producer.

188
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,916
Wait, I'll be back.

189
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,916
You know what?
Sandesh just recited a couplet to me.

190
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,041
Looking at him,
one can't tell he can write so well.

191
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,458
What was it... ah, yes!

192
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,916
"Destruction makes my home,

193
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:21,291
Not others, I have defeated myself"

194
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,000
I can't remember the next line.

195
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,875
"Darkness has not brought light
just like that

196
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,333
I have burnt myself to become a star"

197
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,208
I'll speak to you later.

198
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,375
This is a couplet by Asim Aabaad.

199
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,541
Oh. Really?

200
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,583
I thought Sandesh had written it.

201
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,625
-I didn't get your name.
-Neha. Neha Singh.

202
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,291
-Hi.
-Hi, sir.

203
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,083
What do you do? Oh, how silly of me.

204
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,958
You have to be an actress. Right?

205
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:04,166
If I'm not mistaken, you are the same guy
who was in the music video,

206
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,625
"Jadugar Saiyya," right?

207
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:12,791
Well, that was ten years back.
You still remember?

208
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:17,625
You don't know but me and my friend,
we were huge fans of yours.

209
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,958
Actually, I was in school then,

210
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,333
but yet, we were huge, huge fans of yours.

211
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,375
Really?

212
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,750
That was quite some time back.

213
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,500
Neha, you are here? And I have been
looking for you since so long.

214
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,583
Mr. Ashu is calling you.

215
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,458
Manorama, meet Mr. Rajdeep.

216
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you remember
the "Jadugar Saiyya" music video?

217
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,041
Ya, hello.

218
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,125
-Come! Hurry.
-Ya, sure.

219
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,375
So many girls were hovering
around the old man.

220
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:52,458
You don't know but the old man is a lech.

221
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,791
He doesn't do anything,
just makes himself happy looking at girls.

222
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,791
He'll die if he does anything.

223
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,166
And Sandesh, the shorty,

224
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,000
he has even borrowed 1.3 million rupees
from the old man

225
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,000
and just pleases him
by introducing him to girls.

226
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,875
So Raj, the coordinator
and I will pinch money out of him,

227
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,208
shoot a pilot for DD and submit it.

228
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,708
Okay. Is DD still in demand?

229
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,500
You pay attention to your work.

230
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,666
I'm sending a client to you tomorrow.

231
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,541
He needs an office to rent. Show him.

232
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,208
And you have an ad shoot
the day after tomorrow, right?

233
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,541
For some face wash?
It's a big brand of Indore.

234
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,333
Her skin is glowing and my skin is so bad.

235
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,625
Wonder what face wash she uses.

236
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,041
Cut it!

237
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:44,250
Neha, it's not sakin, it's skin.

238
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,375
Skin. Say "skin."

239
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,458
Say what is written in the script.
Please.

240
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:48,791
Okay, sir.

241
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,125
Action!

242
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:54,500
She has such a good sakin
and my sakin is so oily.

243
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,625
Wonder which face wash she uses.

244
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,208
Let's do it once again.

245
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,208
She has such a good sakin
and my sakin is so oily.

246
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,000
Wonder which face wash she uses.

247
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,458
Cut it!

248
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:11,208
Listen, the girl who is passing by,
try her.

249
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,458
And who will pass by?

250
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,583
We will make Neha do that.
The delay is all because of her.

251
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:20,958
Action!

252
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:26,291
She has such good skin.
Why is my skin so oily?

253
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,000
-I'm just a passerby in the crowd.
-Don't worry.

254
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,833
It happens to everyone the first time.

255
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,333
Meet with Manorama.
She will surely find some way.

256
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,375
They either choose a heroine
as the main model

257
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,750
or a Miss India or something like that.

258
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,041
So, my suggestion is you try serials.

259
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,458
But don't serials
have really long dialogues?

260
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,083
That's not the case in episodic serials.

261
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,666
In those, they need new people, new faces.

262
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:05,708
They are not very particular.

263
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,541
You will get regular work,
regular money will pour in.

264
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,625
Even your acting will get polished.
Right, Vijay?

265
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,458
Yes, true. Shall we meet the client?

266
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,041
Yes, sure. Come.

267
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:21,333
-We'll drop you off too.
-No, I'll sit here for some time.

268
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,333
-Sure?
-Yes, I'm fine.

269
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,458
Let's go.

270
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,166
-Hurry.
-Bye.

271
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,708
-Bye!
-Bye.

272
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,500
-You are in quite a hurry. Bye!
-Let's meet the client,

273
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,833
or he'll leave.

274
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,791
-Hey, hi!
-Oh, Neha.

275
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,583
-How are you?
-Good. Please sit.

276
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,583
Yeah.

277
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,541
So, what's up?

278
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,083
I'm good. All well. What brings you here?

279
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,333
-I had just come with friends.
-And how was your shoot?

280
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,375
Don't ask me! It was really bad.

281
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,125
I mean, I could not say a word
when the cameras were rolling.

282
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,458
It's okay. When I was new,
it happened to me too.

283
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,666
I used to get tongue tied.

284
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,083
Everything is going to fall in place
with time, don't worry.

285
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,416
Hope so.

286
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,166
Give me your number.

287
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,208
Hello.

288
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,333
Sir is calling you.

289
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,916
Yes, come in.

290
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,916
Hello, sir.

291
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,625
Here.

292
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,666
Ashish, can you come in please? Yeah.

293
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,333
Yes, sir.

294
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,666
The Nashik story
where the mother-in-law and husband...

295
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,625
Yes, sir.

296
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:56,583
...burn the daughter-in-law.
We'll keep her for that.

297
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,166
-Okay, sir.
-We'll keep her.

298
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,583
Sir, isn't she a bit too glamorous?

299
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,708
Can you pull back your hair, please?

300
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,291
-Look.
-Yes, sir.

301
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,250
Apply dark make up on her,
make her wear an old sari,

302
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,541
-she'll be okay.
-Okay, sir.

303
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,291
We have the shoot in two days,
where will you go looking?

304
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,708
You're right.
Sir, shall we take an audition?

305
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,583
No, not required.

306
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,250
Please come.

307
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,291
Thank you, sir.

308
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,791
-Hello.
-Neha.

309
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:46,791
Yes, Sis.

310
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:52,541
Mr. Sharma was telling
dad you shot some ad as a passerby?

311
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:56,041
No Sis, that's not me.
That's someone who looks like me.

312
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:58,791
Even here, everyone mistook her for me.

313
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,375
Okay, next week, I will be on
a prime time episode. Don't miss it.

314
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,791
Wow, very good.

315
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,250
When will it be aired?

316
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,416
-I'll tell you the time.
-Alright, you do that.

317
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,625
-Okay, bye Sis!
-Bye.

318
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:22,333
-Somebody save me!
-You bring no dowry from your parents.

319
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,166
You scream at my mother?

320
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,000
You didn't bring any dowry.
Moreover, you are arguing with my mother?

321
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,875
-Save me!
-Shut up!

322
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,583
-You bloody woman! Mother, you...
-I will get the dowry.

323
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,125
-Hit her. Break her legs.
-Move back, I'll deal with her.

324
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,250
I'll kill you! I'll get petrol.

325
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,416
They'll kill me, they'll burn me!

326
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,083
You dare to argue with my mother!

327
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,000
Get petrol!

328
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:49,083
-Somebody save me!
-You move away.

329
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:54,291
-They will kill me! Somebody save me!
-I'll burn her right now.

330
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,625
-She'll leave our house and go.
-You just move away.

331
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,208
They will kill me! Somebody save me!

332
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,333
What is she doing? Has she gone nuts?

333
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,083
Does she have any money?

334
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,625
I don't know.

335
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,416
What do you mean by you don't know?
Ask her.

336
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,625
Deposit money into her account.

337
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:32,791
Shall we leave?

338
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,500
See! Just after watching one episode,
your family sent the deposit money.

339
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:46,791
That's how it is. Even the family
should feel you are doing good work.

340
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,791
No one cares about the idle.

341
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,416
Shall we leave?

342
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:26,333
You feel I introduce you to useless men?
I'll introduce you to gentlemen.

343
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,708
Why are you taking me?
What will I do meeting with him?

344
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,666
Just come.

345
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,250
-Hi.
-Hi.

346
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,583
-She's...
-Neha. Right?

347
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,041
Please sit.

348
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:09,083
-Where are you from?
-From Bhopal.

349
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:17,416
Manorama showed me your pictures.

350
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,375
She insisted that I meet you.

351
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:25,083
So, tell me, how can I help you?

352
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:35,958
I am a businessman and know
some industry people, via friends.

353
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:40,791
Other than that,

354
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:44,416
if you want me to help you
in some way...

355
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,791
Excuse me. Rest room.

356
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,250
You wanted a car
to go into the taxi business?

357
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:06,500
Yes.

358
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,208
What is the initial payment?

359
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,791
About two
or two and a half hundred thousand.

360
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,208
Where will you get the money from?

361
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,250
Do you have income tax papers?

362
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,291
The bank will not give you any loan.

363
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,208
She went home.

364
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:31,500
The washroom is this way
and she went outside.

365
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,333
-Like to have something cold?
-No.

366
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:38,833
Sure?

367
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,250
Alright.

368
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,583
-Hello.
-Hi Neha.

369
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,666
-How are you?
-Fine.

370
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,083
Will you please send me romantic poetry?

371
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,750
-Yes.
-Okay. Thank you.

372
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:11,250
I was just planning...

373
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,833
How was your audition?

374
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,166
It was good.

375
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,583
You don't land any roles.
Your hair is so long.

376
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:22,000
Don't touch my hair.

377
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,375
I love my hair and I'll bag a role
just because of my hair, watch!

378
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,708
Not for anything else.

379
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,458
Want to have some? Have it.

380
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,083
Hi, Neha.

381
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,458
Neha, right?

382
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,541
I've seen you in crime time.

383
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:47,208
You act well, I must say. Superb acting!

384
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:56,125
Why do you have to talk always?
You just have to open your mouth.

385
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:57,458
Give me.

386
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,666
-Happy? Got your protein?
-It's great.

387
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,416
Paid 7,000 rupees for this.

388
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:08,541
What are you talking?
You bought it for 3,000 the last time.

389
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,875
-Why is it 7,000 now?
-That one was not good.

390
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:14,166
There was so much fat in it.
Look at how much fat I've piled on.

391
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,541
-There is no fat in this.
-Does money grow on trees?

392
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,583
Look, no compromise with the body.

393
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,000
I just cannot.

394
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,583
-Please understand.
-I cannot pay so much.

395
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,208
Pay it, I'll repay you later.

396
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,083
I'm expecting payment, I'll repay you.

397
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:29,916
Please. Okay, I'll leave now.

398
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,375
You pay for it, please. Okay?

399
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,083
You are leaving?

400
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,541
Yes. I'll see you at night.

401
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:38,458
-At least give me a kiss.
-You start off anywhere.

402
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,250
-Alright, bye.
-Bye.

403
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:52,500
Look Neha,
I introduce young girls to Ritesh.

404
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,500
If both like it, they exchange numbers.

405
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,416
What happens after that, I don't know.

406
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,833
In exchange, he helps me a little.

407
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,083
He is a good guy.
I have introduced him to many girls.

408
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,250
Everyone has only spoken good about him.

409
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,666
Maybe he has relations with all of them.

410
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,583
Maybe he has relations with none.

411
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,416
But you can also do some proper work,
Manorama.

412
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,750
-This is kind of...
-Say it, that it is pimping.

413
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,916
There are lots of other things
to do in this world.

414
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,125
This is unethical, Manorama.

415
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,000
But do you even understand?

416
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,708
Do you know that I didn't go to school?

417
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,916
My father was a cart pusher.

418
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,208
I also have two children.

419
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,291
You are married?

420
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:49,500
-You have kids?
-Want to meet them?

421
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,541
I grew up in Kalyan.

422
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:58,333
I was broke, so since the past few years,
I have moved here.

423
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,458
You must have heard

424
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,666
that the husband and wife
who live separately

425
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,791
want their children to live with them.

426
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:08,250
But with us, it is the opposite.

427
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,291
We both avoid living with the children

428
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,458
because we cannot fulfill their needs.

429
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,375
My children want to live with me.

430
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,791
But I don't have a permanent address.

431
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,458
How is your relationship
with your husband?

432
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,333
You pay attention to the relationship

433
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:30,083
when your basic needs are met.

434
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,750
The poor man is working somewhere
on a salary of 8000 rupees.

435
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:38,541
He cannot even think
of maintaining the relationship.

436
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,250
Look, there he is.

437
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:47,708
He is 30, but because of all the problems,
he looks 40.

438
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,750
Bye Rishi. Bye Aastha.

439
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,541
Bye Aastha. Bye Rishi.

440
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:56,625
Bye.

441
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:58,583
Bye.

442
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,625
Bye.

443
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,708
Come. Come on in.

444
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:18,916
Come.

445
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,250
Sit.

446
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,083
-It's nice.
-Yes, it is.

447
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:44,500
Manorama, tell me something.

448
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,208
When you are so broke,
why do you spend so much money on boys?

449
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,875
If you save some,
it will be good for your children.

450
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,291
I cannot be so cruel to myself.

451
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,375
What do you think,
if I don't spend money on the boys,

452
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,666
will they give me pleasure?

453
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,166
Find someone in your age group.

454
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:12,333
By the time they reach my age,
they settle down.

455
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,708
They have money and plenty of girls.

456
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,791
Why would they come to me?

457
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:23,333
When you become successful,
appoint me as your secretary.

458
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,208
Alright.

459
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,416
Alright, I have an idea.

460
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,666
You sleep here in the living room.

461
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,875
You will save on rent
and I will get some company.

462
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,250
What do you say?

463
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,833
Alright, now give me a smoke.

464
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:51,250
-You smoke?
-Yes.

465
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:55,333
I used to smoke in the hostel,
in college, with friends.

466
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:56,416
And what about alcohol?

467
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:03,291
Yes, just sometimes at parties.

468
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,541
Great.

469
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:09,833
Give me lighter.

470
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,500
Hello Mr. Singh, where are you going?

471
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,208
How are you?

472
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:23,916
I saw Neha's ad on TV last night.
She looked lovely.

473
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,541
This time,
she had not rubbed her face black.

474
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,708
It was an ad for some medicine.

475
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,458
-What?
-It was a medicine ad.

476
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,166
Those that come on after midnight.

477
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,041
They air on the teleshopping channel.
Go watch.

478
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:46,875
At midnight. On the teleshopping channel.

479
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,708
What is the ad?
You woke me up at such a late hour.

480
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:09,833
Sharma was telling me about an ad
of Neha's that aired at midnight.

481
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,708
-This time she has not blackened her face.
-Really?

482
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,958
She's done some ad
in which she is looking very pretty.

483
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:16,916
Let's watch it.

484
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:20,833
Now I am going to tell you
the mobile features.

485
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:21,791
Yes, it's her! Look!

486
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,875
-18 Megapixel camera.
-Look.

487
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,833
-She's looking pretty, isn't she?
-It's very low price.

488
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,833
Big Ball? What mobile is that?

489
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:32,583
Zuri, smile.

490
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,083
Wow!

491
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,583
You can see how beautiful our model looks.

492
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,791
I'll now show you its video quality.

493
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,875
Zuri, can you dance for me?

494
00:34:48,208 --> 00:34:49,083
Wow!

495
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,541
Wow!

496
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,541
You saw how much she moved,
but the focus was steady.

497
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:00,333
This mobile costs 2999 rupees.

498
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,000
Call on the number given
below right away.

499
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,291
I have Big Ball mobile.

500
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,250
Do you have Big Ball... mobile?

501
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,791
Come on! A little sleazy is okay.

502
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,375
Come on.

503
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,458
-She is looking pretty.
-Yes, very pretty.

504
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,625
Alright, you go, I'll join you.

505
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,916
Come.

506
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:36,375
Neha must be awake now.
We'll call her. Come.

507
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:39,666
Her makeup was so good.

508
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,416
We will tell Neha.

509
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:52,375
Sharma said she is in some medicine ad.

510
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,791
Before, he used to be constantly tired.

511
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,458
He would return
from the office angry and irritated.

512
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,583
He had even stopped playing with the kids.

513
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:02,750
I was very disturbed.

514
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:08,083
When I confided in my friend,
she gave me a solution.

515
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,875
Maingold capsules,

516
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:14,458
which gave him
new found strength and energy.

517
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:15,833
Like greenery in a drought?

518
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:18,750
Maingold capsules changed my life.

519
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:20,250
And now,

520
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,875
he plays with the kids and with me too.

521
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,166
Thank you, Maingold capsules!

522
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,750
Take it every day and make your wife happy
with Maingold capsules!

523
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:33,500
Oh, God!

524
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,375
She will put me down.

525
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,500
After you two went to bed,

526
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:45,041
I saw her in such embarrassing ads.

527
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,750
This girl has embarrassed me.

528
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,375
I'm afraid to step out of the house.

529
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,791
Why did she go to Mumbai? To do this?

530
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:57,416
She didn't want to get married, fine.
But what is all this?

531
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,541
If she continues to do such bad ads,
they will stick for life.

532
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,583
The family has enough money,
we don't lack anything.

533
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:09,833
Call her right now
and tell her everything I have said.

534
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,833
Ask her to come back right away.

535
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,166
-Call her.
-You...

536
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,083
You'll not say anything. I forbid you!

537
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,333
Call her, Smita. Now!

538
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,208
-Dad...
-Call her!

539
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,833
-Hello.
-I'm sorry.

540
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,208
I understand your problem.

541
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:42,916
But I have limited staff in my office.

542
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,166
And you are not really qualified
for any specific job.

543
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,666
Even if you begin somewhere,

544
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,791
you will get paid 10000, 20000?

545
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:04,416
I understand
that you don't want to return home.

546
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:08,958
Why don't you take your father's help?

547
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,791
But do only good work. Okay?

548
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:18,625
I'm sure things will work out for you.

549
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,208
I'll leave.

550
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Listen.

551
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,166
It's small advice but take it.

552
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,166
Everything has a price.

553
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:35,000
Before buying, check the price.

554
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,750
You may end up paying for it
all your life.

555
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,125
So think twice.

556
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:45,708
I have learnt to live,
you talk about yourself.

557
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:15,875
Where is the office of Watersign Creative?

558
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,041
That's a big production house.

559
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,500
They called you?

560
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,750
Rajdeep sent a message.

561
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,791
He said some new serial
is getting launched.

562
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,208
They have called me for a role in it.

563
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:33,500
They liked my pictures.

564
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,000
They'll make me Laxmibai!

565
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,875
-Yes, Sis.
-Congratulations.

566
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,208
Shall I tell dad? He'll be very happy.

567
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,791
No Sis, why tell him?

568
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,666
Everything is still in the initial stages.

569
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:46,208
If they made you sign a contract,
they will make you act too.

570
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,166
Yes, like you know
how good an actress I am,

571
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,291
how well I act.

572
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,916
They will make you do it,
why are you stressing yourself?

573
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,958
Alright Sis, I'll call you in the evening.

574
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:01,541
-Fine, we will talk at night.
-Okay, bye.

575
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:02,958
Bye.

576
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
-Is everything fine?
-Yes.

577
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:15,333
Whenever I talk to my family,
I feel like I am on some mission.

578
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,875
I have to give a report on everything.

579
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,583
You are very lucky.

580
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:22,125
At least someone is asking you.

581
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,916
How is that lucky?

582
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:37,791
{\an8}This is a very ambitious project
of my advertising company.

583
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,833
It's a huge campaign.

584
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,875
Five hundred hoardings are going to be
put up in the whole country.

585
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,916
We have big media plans.

586
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,166
You are a star.

587
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:56,333
-Now be focused.
-I will.

588
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,083
All thanks to you.

589
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:10,000
You deserve it.

590
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,750
The treat is on me today.

591
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:19,250
Now I feel that
I will be able to live with my children.

592
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,375
Work with dedication.

593
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,541
Come off it now! Everything will be fine.

594
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:29,958
Why have you called Vijay?

595
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:33,250
He is happy for you bagging the serial.

596
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:37,541
And I wouldn't be able
to afford the taxi. So...

597
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,958
Tell me something,
why is his hairstyle always the same?

598
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:55,833
Once, a stone fell on his head from
a building. He's got a bald patch there.

599
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,541
He wears a wig since then.

600
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,375
-But don't tell him.
-Are you serious?

601
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:04,041
Don't tell him I told you.

602
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:24,875
I saw one even at the railway station.

603
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,833
Mr. Singh, you must be proud.

604
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:34,125
Your daughter will become a big actress.

605
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,833
She'll even get roles in films.

606
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,708
-Hello.
-Neha, dear.

607
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,416
Yes, dad.

608
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,416
Are you busy?

609
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:06,750
No, dad.

610
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,458
Sorry to have bothered you.

611
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,083
Dad, I'm sorry you had to face
embarrassment because of me.

612
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:15,083
And I promise it will never happen again.

613
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:20,208
I saw your hoardings today.
I was very happy.

614
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,916
We all are very proud of you, Neha.

615
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:32,375
Buy a car, to maintain your standard
in the industry.

616
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:34,291
Yes, dad.

617
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,166
God bless you.

618
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,083
-Bye.
-Bye, dad.

619
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:56,500
Thank you.

620
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:03,791
So, you are treating me
for bagging the serial?

621
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,583
I'd gone to the set.
It's really beautiful.

622
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:09,791
It truly is.

623
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:16,000
Mr. Rajdeep, you always talk about work.

624
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,791
-Shall we talk about something else?
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

625
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:23,583
Whenever we meet,
we actually do only talk about work.

626
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,833
Who do you have in your family?

627
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,208
My mom, dad, an older sister
and a cute niece.

628
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:36,041
Oh, wow. That's really nice.

629
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,000
Are you married?

630
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,083
No.

631
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,583
Girlfriend?

632
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:45,666
No.

633
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,125
No girlfriend?

634
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:22,166
You went all dressed up.

635
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:24,750
Stop... Enough.

636
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:30,333
Look,
if he is not looking at you that way,

637
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,041
it means only one thing. That he is gay.

638
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,375
Okay, listen...

639
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:45,250
You know that
he has a 21-year-old boyfriend?

640
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:50,041
And listen. He was asking poetry from me
that he used to send him.

641
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:54,083
Gentleman. Man to man.

642
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:02,541
Okay now stop laughing at him, Manorama.

643
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,875
What are you saying? I'm laughing at you.

644
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,458
You are really very bad.

645
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,208
Mad you are.

646
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:13,666
What is Smita doing? Sleeping?

647
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,125
You aren't asleep yet?

648
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:19,791
She's in her room, talking to Sanjeev.

649
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,708
Both the daughters share your character.

650
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,166
No one can dare point a finger.

651
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,958
And they are as stubborn as you.

652
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,166
No one can appease them easily.

653
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,416
That is what I regret up to now.

654
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,000
I cannot bear to see Smita crying.

655
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,166
I abused her husband so much.

656
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:49,375
He's left her here and is alone in the UK
since two years.

657
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,208
It's nothing like that.
They love each other.

658
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,625
They talk every day.

659
00:48:57,416 --> 00:48:59,333
He has no reason to hate her.

660
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,333
They are only punishing me.

661
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:06,416
You're assuming things.
It's nothing of the sort.

662
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,416
You were always so worried about Neha too.

663
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,041
God fixed everything.

664
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:17,958
Good times come unexpectedly.

665
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:20,458
Go to sleep.

666
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,500
Good night.

667
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:34,750
You betrayers!
I will not let my honor be filed.

668
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,333
It's defiled.
Will not let my honor be defiled.

669
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:39,750
Okay sir, one more.

670
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:46,625
You betrayers!
I will not let my honor be filed.

671
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:50,375
-She can't do it.
-Honor cannot be de-filed.

672
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,458
-Defiled!
-Say defiled.

673
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,791
-Okay sir, one more.
-Alright.

674
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,416
You betrayers! I will not let my...

675
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:07,041
Hey... What is your problem?

676
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:11,250
She won't be able to do it,
she'll turn me mad.

677
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,375
She's no good.

678
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:16,541
What are you doing?
Assume there is no camera in front of you.

679
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,375
There is a camera,
how can I think otherwise?

680
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:23,875
-We'll do one thing, Neha.
-Yes, sir?

681
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,250
We'll shoot tomorrow. Let's pack up today.

682
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:29,166
-Call Karan.
-Let us try once more, please.

683
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,541
I'm saying something good only,
it's nothing bad.

684
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:55,000
Yes true, but...

685
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,416
She is good.

686
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,833
You never give me.
You also should... gift.

687
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:01,875
Should I take it?

688
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Neha.

689
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:18,666
I've brought oblations from the temple.

690
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:21,625
And also some sweets to
celebrate your bagging the serial.

691
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:23,458
Give me.

692
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:28,541
Shall I leave?

693
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:31,958
Alright.

694
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:46,791
No, thanks.

695
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,375
-Tired?
-Yes, I'm tired.

696
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:51,083
Why, what happened?

697
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:55,791
I don't know what's happening.

698
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:58,000
I forget everything
as soon as the camera is switched on.

699
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:00,416
Not a word comes out of my mouth.

700
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:03,958
-It happens with everyone. It's okay.
-But yet...

701
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,666
-Do you know any cameraman?
-Let me try.

702
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,125
I think I'll have to practice
day and night.

703
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,166
Besides, you know
they can't handle it for long.

704
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,625
Nothing will go wrong.
Let me see if I can help.

705
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:23,958
Hello.

706
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,666
-Neha.
-Yes, ma'am.

707
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:26,666
So sorry to inform you

708
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:29,208
that you are no longer a part
of the Laxmibai project.

709
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,375
-What?
-We've replaced you.

710
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:35,250
Ma'am, how could you do this?
At least one chance.

711
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,041
Neha, this is not an audition.

712
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:40,500
One hour of shooting loss
is a loss of lakhs of rupees.

713
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:45,083
Ma'am, one...
And what about the contract then?

714
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,166
Read it carefully.
It is clearly mentioned therein

715
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:49,250
that we can replace you whenever we want.

716
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,708
You will be paid for one day of shooting.

717
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:53,791
One chance, ma'am!

718
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,250
Sorry, can't help you.

719
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:58,041
What happened?

720
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,708
God!

721
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:06,958
I'm out. They ousted me from the serial.

722
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:10,333
They can't do that.
I'll talk to the association.

723
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,916
No, let it be. Please...

724
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:13,458
No wait, I'll talk to them now.

725
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:15,916
Manorama, shut up! Stop the nonsense.

726
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:33,541
Listen, make arrangements
for your stay elsewhere.

727
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,125
I want to be alone.

728
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,250
Neha has been replaced?

729
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:42,583
-Smita.
-Yes, mom.

730
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:44,833
Neha has not been answering
my calls for two days.

731
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,083
What is the matter?

732
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,458
I spoke to her.

733
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,791
She is busy.
She will call when she is free.

734
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,750
Let's go.

735
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,666
I'd come to pick up my clothes.

736
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:27,250
I was in the hospital.
The kids were asking for you.

737
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:30,583
What happened to you?

738
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,541
I have a cyst.

739
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:37,333
The doctor says it could be cancerous.

740
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,833
I'll need to get operated.

741
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:42,625
I'll get the operation done
when I make some money.

742
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:52,000
I told Vijay. Even he was sorry
about your losing the serial.

743
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:54,041
Forget it.

744
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,541
Tell me, will you have something?

745
00:55:56,666 --> 00:55:57,708
No.

746
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:01,583
I'll leave.

747
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:05,458
-Where are you going?
-Ritesh called me.

748
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:07,541
I'm going to meet him.

749
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:14,958
Okay listen, I'll drop you off.
I have not left the house since many days.

750
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,541
It will be an outing for me too.

751
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,458
Shall we go?

752
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Let's go.

753
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,041
Stop here.

754
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,541
-Okay?
-Come.

755
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,125
No, you meet him.

756
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:41,750
You also meet him, he is not that bad.

757
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,666
Coming?

758
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,833
I saw your "Laxmibai" hoardings.

759
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:53,666
It's a huge campaign,
and you're looking really nice.

760
00:56:54,416 --> 00:56:55,333
When is it getting aired on TV?

761
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:02,458
She quit. One has to work
really hard in serials.

762
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:04,708
But why?

763
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:07,666
I mean, it looked good.

764
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,916
Anyway, you guys know better.

765
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:13,416
She wants to do a film.

766
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:15,541
Oh, really?

767
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:21,958
Even I am thinking of making a small film.

768
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:25,708
Nothing that big,
just to experience the market.

769
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,833
No, it's a great idea.

770
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:31,833
Because small films do big business.
Only the story should be good.

771
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,583
I have found a very interesting story.

772
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:40,041
And also found a good director.

773
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,500
A good director and a good actress.

774
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,041
That's all one wants.

775
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:48,000
Yes, why not?

776
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:06,208
Yes, Mr. Sharma, tell me.

777
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:09,000
-What do I say?
-Why, what happened?

778
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,375
I was really sad.

779
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:13,375
Mr. Singh, I have bad news.

780
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:16,416
-What?
-Neha's hoarding has been removed.

781
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:17,875
The hoarding has been removed?

782
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:21,500
I also heard that
she has been replaced in the serial.

783
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,875
-What?
-I was really distressed to know this.

784
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:25,958
How terrible you must be feeling.

785
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,875
I called to find out.

786
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:30,666
I'll call you back.

787
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:34,666
Smita!

788
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,958
Smita!

789
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:40,791
What am I hearing?

790
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:43,708
Sharma says
she's been replaced in the serial.

791
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,333
Her hoarding has been removed.

792
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:50,708
Yes. She said it was very tiring.
She quit.

793
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:53,291
Why didn't you tell me?

794
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:57,208
Disgusting!

795
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:06,083
Forget about returning home because
they won't be able to adjust to you

796
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,833
nor will you be able to adjust to them.

797
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,750
We have very little time.
We'll have to do something big.

798
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:21,291
Are you high, Manorama?
You're talking nonsense.

799
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:25,750
I have my whole life ahead of me.
Besides, I'm doing a film.

800
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:30,166
The director is new, the actors are new,
the producer is new.

801
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,833
The chance of such a film

802
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:37,541
being a hit is one in a million.

803
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:41,541
Even if it deserves an Oscar,
it won't run here.

804
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:45,708
Now what is this you are saying?

805
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:53,500
Tell me something,
what comes first, after childhood?

806
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,708
Youth.

807
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:59,000
And then? Old age?

808
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:02,041
Yes, old age. But why?

809
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:07,041
Because once you lose this freshness,
do you know what you're called?

810
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:09,875
Worn out rubber.

811
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:16,041
Look, it is necessary
that you have a big promotion

812
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:19,458
and that you get work
with some big time actor.

813
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,958
Or that you get some big film.

814
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,208
And how will that happen, madam?

815
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,125
What do you think of Ritesh?

816
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:34,416
-He's good.
-He's good, or do you like him?

817
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,166
What kind of a question is that?

818
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:39,875
He really likes you.

819
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:45,541
He is in a place
where he can help you with your career.

820
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:52,083
Why don't you have an affair with him?

821
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,041
Are you mad? You've lost it, Manorama.

822
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:01,708
Affair? I should have feelings for him.

823
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:05,208
Oh, really? Since how long
have you been struggling

824
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:09,291
and being humiliated?
And you still care about feelings?

825
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:28,333
Alright, give me a smoke.

826
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:36,708
Dad,

827
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:41,666
there's a new article on Neha.
She's doing a film.

828
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,166
Look, she had a press conference.

829
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:49,833
I'm tired of hearing all that news.

830
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:53,833
She doesn't know how to work,
I wonder what she does.

831
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:57,041
She is earning ill repute
and bringing us ill repute as well.

832
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:03,833
Get me a cup of tea, dear.

833
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:53,583
Don't trouble me now and again.
You always start off.

834
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:04,041
There is something about Neha.

835
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:07,208
Despite being so beautiful,
she hasn't gotten any work for so long.

836
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,541
She is very decent, that's why.

837
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:11,708
You don't come across
such girls nowadays.

838
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:13,666
She's an angel.

839
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,500
She will sleep with a man

840
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:19,958
only after marriage. That's definite!

841
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:22,166
This uncouth attitude of yours.

842
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:24,541
You will never change.

843
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:27,875
You are so cheap.
At least you don't say such things.

844
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,458
Look, a man can do everything.

845
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:35,708
But a woman must lose her
virginity only after marriage.

846
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:38,833
-You may dress up modern but your thinking
-

847
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:40,250
will remain that of an illiterate.

848
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:45,000
-You will continue to behave uncouth.
-Okay, get in.

849
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:50,250
Sir, I cannot mouth such long dialogues.

850
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:57,125
Neha, you did serials, right?
You did long dialogues in those.

851
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,583
Why can't you do it now?

852
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:03,916
Yes, but they were simple

853
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:07,083
one line dialogues.

854
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,750
Sir, I did an ad that had long dialogues.

855
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:18,625
I have an idea.

856
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:22,333
We depend on people

857
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:26,833
and add to the problems in our lives.

858
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:31,375
Whereas actually, every individual's
journey of life is different.

859
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,166
Is that okay, sir?

860
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,875
Spot! Mobile.

861
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:46,708
Anuj, when do you think
he will call pack up?

862
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,125
-Pack up?
-Yes.

863
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:50,125
I don't know.

864
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:52,708
Hello.

865
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:57,000
In dreams, where is the dream?

866
01:04:57,125 --> 01:05:01,916
In sleep, where is sleep?

867
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:04,666
There's just you...

868
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,166
Which film's song is this?

869
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:12,416
I've written it. Nice composition?

870
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:15,083
You composed it?

871
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,250
Yes.

872
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:21,458
Yes, I heard someone say you write well.

873
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,125
We must use it in the film.

874
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,958
I'll speak to the lyricist.

875
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:34,958
Listen, shall we party today?

876
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:40,750
Okay.

877
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,916
In dreams

878
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:14,625
Where is the dream?

879
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:19,000
In sleep

880
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:21,916
Where is sleep?

881
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:26,208
In dreams

882
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,958
Where is the dream?

883
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,375
In sleep

884
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:36,458
Where is sleep?

885
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:40,083
There's just you

886
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:43,750
Only you!

887
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,708
In breaths

888
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:58,333
Where is the breath?

889
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,666
There's just you

890
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:04,625
Only you!

891
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,625
What is this girl up to?
She's always on her phone.

892
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,708
She doesn't learn her dialogues
or practice. She only cares about pack up.

893
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,666
I don't understand why sir
is tolerating her so much.

894
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:29,500
-Do you know who she is?
-Who?

895
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:33,291
-She is Ritesh sir's girlfriend.
-Okay!

896
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:52,791
I'd like to walk such

897
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:55,583
That you become my journey

898
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,458
I'd like to walk such

899
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:06,458
That you become my journey

900
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,708
I begin my journey from you

901
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:13,291
And end it at you

902
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:17,750
Open my heart

903
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:21,125
You'll find yourself in it

904
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:22,708
Let me be

905
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:24,500
The misunderstanding

906
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:27,833
You become my belief

907
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:34,416
I am

908
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,625
Not even within me

909
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:49,000
There's just you, only you!

910
01:08:53,166 --> 01:08:54,833
Alright, I'll call you back.

911
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:20,833
Your phone is switched off?

912
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,958
You didn't tell me you didn't go
for the shoot yesterday.

913
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:34,958
Everyone was troubled.

914
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:37,250
The director called.

915
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:42,750
We could have come here later.

916
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,833
You suffered a huge loss
because of me, right?

917
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:51,250
It's not about the loss.

918
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:55,375
It's just... it's not right
for your career.

919
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:02,666
It's okay. Relax.

920
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,000
Come, we'll have breakfast together.

921
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:36,583
Give me some dreams

922
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:40,541
That entertain my sleep

923
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:47,250
Give me some dreams

924
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:51,500
That entertain my sleep

925
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:55,791
Give me some excuses

926
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:58,416
That save my nights

927
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:02,458
Give me a souvenir that

928
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:06,166
Shows I belong to you

929
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:09,083
Give me such fate lines

930
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:13,041
That change my destiny

931
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:19,416
Words

932
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,375
There are none on my lips

933
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:26,666
Words

934
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,708
There are none on my lips

935
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:34,041
There's just you

936
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:37,666
Only you!

937
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:05,833
Spot! Mobile.

938
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:25,500
Yes Neha, tell me.

939
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,208
-How are you?
-I'm good.

940
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:30,625
-What's going on?
-All good.

941
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:31,708
Fine.

942
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,041
We have packed up.

943
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:35,166
Let's meet up.

944
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:37,666
Eight o'clock?

945
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,375
-Okay.
-Alright. See you then.

946
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,125
Okay. Bye bye.

947
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:54,125
The party was boring for you?

948
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:58,458
No. It was fine.

949
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:05,000
Good thing your film is complete.
Your family will be very happy.

950
01:13:05,916 --> 01:13:07,291
Especially your dad.

951
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,583
Yes, everyone is happy.
Everyone liked the story too.

952
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:15,041
But dad'll be happy when I get married.

953
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:21,208
Yes, families always insist on marriage.

954
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,583
I did not come to Mumbai
to become an actress.

955
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:46,958
I even did a film to prove to the world.

956
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:50,291
I mean, I want to work,

957
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:53,625
but at least I won't have
to struggle after this film.

958
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:04,208
Dad insisted that I get married,

959
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:07,125
but at that time I hated even
the mention of marriage.

960
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:12,458
But after meeting you,
my view has changed.

961
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:16,291
I mean, with time, people's views change.

962
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:21,416
I was wondering, should we get married?

963
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:25,291
We won't announce it publicly now,

964
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:28,125
but we can live together, you know.

965
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:40,416
Hello. You had called?

966
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:43,250
Okay.

967
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,208
Yes, alright.

968
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:54,083
Neha, I will have to leave,
something urgent has come up.

969
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:58,500
We'll sit and discuss this at leisure.

970
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,291
I'll be back in an hour.

971
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:04,791
-Alright, then come upstairs.
-Yes sure, I will.

972
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:07,000
Hello!

973
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,500
-Bye.
-Bye.

974
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,708
Come on in! I am very happy today.

975
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:27,958
Tell me, what will you have?

976
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:32,875
Will you have chow mein, a drink, what?

977
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:35,250
What's the matter, you're very happy.

978
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:37,083
Have you found a guy?

979
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:42,250
What rubbish!
I have a queue of boys waiting.

980
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:45,250
I don't enjoy sex any longer.

981
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,708
So... By the way, I'm very happy today.

982
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:51,458
-Ask me why.
-Tell me why.

983
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:55,166
Ritesh is buying me a car

984
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,708
to operate as a taxi,

985
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:02,041
that too, without a loan.
So my life is sorted.

986
01:16:02,916 --> 01:16:04,875
This is what I wanted.

987
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:08,750
Tell me something,

988
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,583
you are no longer introducing Ritesh
to girls, are you?

989
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:14,958
What kind of a question is that?

990
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:17,333
Don't I know what's going on
between you two?

991
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:19,958
Why would I introduce him to any girl now?

992
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:24,625
Anyway, Ritesh is coming home in a while.

993
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,791
So you leave the house for some time.

994
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,916
He may not like you being around. So...

995
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:36,208
Get me a glass of water.

996
01:16:55,333 --> 01:16:56,333
Come, sit.

997
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:15,666
Manorama, I want to tell you something.

998
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:22,083
Although it's a secret,
but I must tell you.

999
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:26,208
Because never know about you...

1000
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:31,166
But I can trust you, can't I?

1001
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,083
Have I made any mistake?

1002
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:39,875
Anyway, forget it. I'm getting married.

1003
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:42,750
What?

1004
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:45,208
I mean, to whom?

1005
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,458
Who am I involved with?

1006
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:54,625
-Ritesh.
-So of course I will marry him.

1007
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,458
I don't sleep around with everyone.

1008
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:02,791
Anyways. I wonder what
happened to my language.

1009
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,666
And yes, I may not be able
to meet you much after marriage

1010
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:13,250
because you know

1011
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:17,833
how insecure these men
become about their wives. So...

1012
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:21,833
Okay then, I'm leaving.

1013
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,833
What does Ritesh say now?

1014
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:32,083
When I met you, I was
told you were very ambitious.

1015
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:36,166
I wanted to make a film and
coincidentally, you were working in it.

1016
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:39,500
Look Neha, if I had any idea that
you had future plans

1017
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,250
regarding me,

1018
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:43,791
I would have stopped you long ago.

1019
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:46,666
So as to avoid hurting you,
I never told you this earlier.

1020
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:51,916
I'm married, Neha.
I also have a four-year-old child.

1021
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:55,125
My family lives in the UK.

1022
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:57,958
Manorama!

1023
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,333
Come here!

1024
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:08,791
-You knew Ritesh was married.
-What? I didn't know.

1025
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:10,416
You knew Ritesh

1026
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:12,833
was married!

1027
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:16,125
-Wait a minute. I didn't know.
-You knew Ritesh was married!

1028
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,208
Listen to me. I didn't know.

1029
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:22,000
To make money, you sold me
to a married man!

1030
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:27,208
-You knew! You knew!
-I didn't know anything.

1031
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:31,541
-Listen to me!
-Get out right now!

1032
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:35,458
-At least listen to me. Neha!
-Get out of my house!

1033
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:38,208
-Neha... Neha.
-Get out of my house!

1034
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:42,458
And don't ever show me your face again!

1035
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:55,375
Neha.

1036
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:00,750
Neha.

1037
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:07,166
Neha.

1038
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:10,458
You are more intelligent than me.

1039
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:12,791
How is being depressed going to help?

1040
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:16,416
I mean, you will only ruin your health.

1041
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:20,708
And your film is also going to be released
in a few days.

1042
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:27,541
You will come across many people
like Manorama.

1043
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:30,083
You should not have trusted her so much.

1044
01:22:31,541 --> 01:22:34,000
You start going to the gym, eating well.

1045
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:36,750
If you wish, we can go shopping,

1046
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,000
buy stuff.

1047
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:53,291
What nonsense is that?
How can he replace Neha in the film?

1048
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:58,541
You know how much hope Neha
had for this film.

1049
01:22:58,666 --> 01:23:02,916
She could not act.
And you know what a big chance she had.

1050
01:23:03,041 --> 01:23:05,125
But she has a short attention span.

1051
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:11,083
Anyway, tell her she has been replaced.

1052
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,208
What?

1053
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,458
How can I tell her?

1054
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:19,125
I can't tell her. You tell her.

1055
01:23:19,916 --> 01:23:22,583
Just tell her.

1056
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,833
-If she finds out from someone else,
-Hey, listen!

1057
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,333
-she will be hurt.
-Hey, listen!

1058
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:31,041
How can I tell her? I won't... Mano...

1059
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:33,625
Sorry Sis, I was so busy with the shoot,

1060
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:36,041
I never got the time to speak to you.

1061
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:39,208
What do you mean?
You didn't have time to say hello?

1062
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:44,375
Anyway, forget that.
Dad is very excited about your film.

1063
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:46,875
He even liked the story.

1064
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:51,041
He said that the whole family
will watch it together on its release.

1065
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:54,458
If you know the release date, tell us,

1066
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:56,750
we will pre-book the show.

1067
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:59,083
Did you act well?

1068
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:02,083
Yes Sis, the director was very good.

1069
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:04,958
Good. Okay, talk to mom.

1070
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,333
Yes, my child, tell me.

1071
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:11,250
Yes, mom?

1072
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:13,708
Do you observe the fast

1073
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:15,541
on Saturdays?

1074
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:16,958
Don't forget.

1075
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,458
No, mom.

1076
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:22,458
Shall I tell you something?
Malhotra came to our house

1077
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:24,666
with his son and daughter-in-law.

1078
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:28,708
The Malhotra who had brought
his NRI son's proposal for you.

1079
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:33,875
Your dad told him that you are
in Mumbai and doing a film.

1080
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:37,375
They were shocked.

1081
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:43,791
Forget that, mom. Tell me, how are you?

1082
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:46,583
What will happen to me? I'm fine.
You take care.

1083
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:52,208
I'll talk to you later, mom.

1084
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:56,625
-Fine. Do call.
-Yes, mom. Bye.

1085
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:20,250
Hello. Neha?

1086
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:21,875
I have to tell you something.

1087
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:25,250
I met Manorama yesterday.

1088
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,750
She told me
you have been replaced in the film.

1089
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:31,041
I play every time

1090
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:33,875
I lose every time

1091
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:36,666
I play every time

1092
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:39,375
I lose every time

1093
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:43,416
The games of life

1094
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:50,166
Are very enticing

1095
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:56,125
I have been fooled

1096
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:01,000
By life a lot

1097
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:26,791
Life

1098
01:27:26,916 --> 01:27:30,208
Has given

1099
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:34,416
Many excuses

1100
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:40,625
I have been fooled

1101
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:46,375
By life a lot

1102
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:49,875
It makes me cry

1103
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,666
While it laughs at me

1104
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:55,458
It makes me cry

1105
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:58,500
While it laughs at me

1106
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:01,416
Life plays

1107
01:28:01,541 --> 01:28:04,125
A lot of pranks on me

1108
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:07,083
Life plays

1109
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,750
A lot of pranks on me

1110
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:12,125
Life

1111
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:15,416
Has given

1112
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:20,041
Many excuses

1113
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,541
Life, tell me, are you with me

1114
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:43,291
Or against me

1115
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:46,833
You show me the destination

1116
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,916
And then cheat me

1117
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:52,708
For a few moments

1118
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:54,916
Of laughter

1119
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:57,375
Why are you punishing me

1120
01:28:57,458 --> 01:29:00,708
With a lifetime of tears

1121
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:37,166
Don't bless me

1122
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:39,875
With a life now

1123
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,708
Don't bless me

1124
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:45,458
With a life now

1125
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:48,625
Life

1126
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:51,208
Has ill-treated me a lot

1127
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:22,791
Listen, Neha's phone has been
out of reach for two days.

1128
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:25,250
Even Sonal is not in Mumbai.

1129
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:28,458
Smita and I were thinking
of going and meeting her.

1130
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:31,208
I wonder where she is living,
how she is living.

1131
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:32,750
We should go and meet her, right?

1132
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:40,083
Alright.

1133
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:42,875
What did he say?

1134
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:45,958
He said he'll come home and discuss it.

1135
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:53,541
Because once you lose this freshness,
you know what you are called?

1136
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:55,125
Worn out rubber.

1137
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:27,583
Neha, the doctor has called you
for a check up.

1138
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,666
Neha, do you want water?

1139
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:00,625
Neha,

1140
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:05,375
the doctor has forbidden you
from taking any kind of narcotic.

1141
01:32:10,708 --> 01:32:12,333
I'll get fresh food in the evening.

1142
01:32:12,916 --> 01:32:15,791
If you permit, shall I keep the house key?

1143
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:23,416
I'll leave.

1144
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:35,750
In today's practical life,
only common sense works.

1145
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:39,750
Your philosophy will make a joke of you.

1146
01:32:40,708 --> 01:32:43,458
Neha has got a film offer as a heroine.

1147
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:45,166
Dad was happily telling everyone.

1148
01:32:45,291 --> 01:32:47,375
She's doing a cheap ad.
I'm so embarrassed.

1149
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:50,458
She is an item!

1150
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:53,958
Why don't you take your father's help?

1151
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:56,625
I saw your hoardings today.
We all are very proud of you,

1152
01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:58,916
Neha.

1153
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,166
What do you think of Ritesh?

1154
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,458
He really likes you.

1155
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:06,708
Why didn't you tell me earlier,

1156
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:08,333
Manorama?

1157
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:24,791
Neha.

1158
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:29,541
Neha.

1159
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:32,708
I've brought food.

1160
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:53,375
If you wish, I'll call your family.

1161
01:33:54,416 --> 01:33:55,416
Yes.

1162
01:33:58,458 --> 01:34:00,166
What have you done to yourself?

1163
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:07,083
-I'll get something to eat.
-No, sit.

1164
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,708
I'm finished.

1165
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:18,208
Even you find me bad.

1166
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:21,333
I didn't mean that.

1167
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:25,791
No, no, I have become ugly.

1168
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:29,791
Finished. Worn out rubber.

1169
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,666
-No, that's not what I meant.
-Shut up!

1170
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,250
Don't change your statement.

1171
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:41,458
Dad had said

1172
01:34:41,916 --> 01:34:45,083
that if I don't make a career,
my life is finished.

1173
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:48,500
Finished. I'm finished!

1174
01:34:49,625 --> 01:34:52,916
Even you won't come? Right?

1175
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:55,875
No...

1176
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:58,625
Neha,

1177
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:02,000
this field is not for girls like you.

1178
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:04,958
You go get married.

1179
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:11,291
Who will marry me, a loser?

1180
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:17,125
No one will. Look at my face.

1181
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:20,750
I've lost my youth, my freshness.

1182
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:23,583
Anyone would marry you.

1183
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,458
You are saying that to comfort me.

1184
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:30,125
-No, Neha.
-No one will marry me.

1185
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:33,416
-It's not like that.
-Go away!

1186
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:36,833
-Get out of here!
-It's not like that.

1187
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:41,750
It's not like that?

1188
01:35:43,625 --> 01:35:45,041
Will you marry me?

1189
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:46,916
Huh?

1190
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:52,250
Come on, let's get married.

1191
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:58,000
-No, no. Come on, let's get married.
-No. No. Neha, I didn't mean that.

1192
01:35:58,125 --> 01:36:01,125
-Marry me.
-No, Neha.

1193
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:05,666
-Come on, marry me.
-Listen to me. Neha, listen to me.

1194
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:10,041
-Listen to me, please.
-Let's get married.

1195
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:11,583
Please... Please.

1196
01:37:20,708 --> 01:37:23,875
-What the hell are you doing in my bed?
-Listen to me!

1197
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
-Get out!
-

1198
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:27,708
-Listen--
-Get out, I said!

1199
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:29,375
Rascal!

1200
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:49,791
-I said go! Get out!
-At least listen to me.

1201
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:54,750
-Go away, or I'll call the police.
-At least listen.

1202
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,375
-Go away!
-Listen...

1203
01:37:56,833 --> 01:38:01,958
-Listen to me. Let me explain.
-Go away!

1204
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:04,875
-Let me explain. Listen.
-I said get out.

1205
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,208
I'm telling you.

1206
01:38:06,791 --> 01:38:11,208
-Let me explain. Listen. Listen to me.
-Go away!

1207
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:12,583
-But...
-Go away!

1208
01:38:12,708 --> 01:38:15,500
-Listen to me...
-I'll call the police.

1209
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:17,958
-Listen to me...
-Leave!

1210
01:38:18,083 --> 01:38:19,083
Shut up!

1211
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:21,500
Shut up!

1212
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:24,708
Who will you call?

1213
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:30,541
What are you going on ranting?
We have gotten married.

1214
01:38:31,416 --> 01:38:33,541
What? Are you out of your mind?

1215
01:38:33,666 --> 01:38:35,166
-Are you mad?
-Shut up!

1216
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,041
Shut up!

1217
01:38:39,666 --> 01:38:42,333
I kept refusing.

1218
01:38:43,166 --> 01:38:44,750
You were ready to die.

1219
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:49,583
You kept a knife to your neck.
What if you'd hurt yourself?

1220
01:38:50,583 --> 01:38:51,625
If you'd died?

1221
01:38:54,416 --> 01:38:55,416
Why did I?

1222
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,583
Look, we got married.

1223
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:03,333
Look.

1224
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:06,166
See!

1225
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:11,791
Take a look.

1226
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:16,416
-See some more.
-No.

1227
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:18,958
Bloody fool.

1228
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:41,041
Why are you crying so much, Neha?

1229
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,583
We only got married.

1230
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,125
We didn't commit any sin.

1231
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:51,375
God has given you a new chance now.

1232
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:54,750
We will begin life afresh.

1233
01:39:55,958 --> 01:39:59,958
And yes, don't take narcotics hereafter.

1234
01:40:02,208 --> 01:40:04,916
If it had been someone else,
anything could have happened.

1235
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:25,250
Vijay, you have not told anybody,
have you?

1236
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:28,541
No, I just put the pics on Facebook.

1237
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:33,250
-Oh, God!
-My friends really approved.

1238
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:35,375
I got many likes.

1239
01:40:36,958 --> 01:40:41,833
I tagged you too. Just check,
even you must have gotten many likes.

1240
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:46,458
Your sister was calling again and again.

1241
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:51,791
We'll go to my village tomorrow.

1242
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:57,458
My mother will like you, I'm sure.

1243
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:32,291
Saw what has your daughter
been doing for the past three days?

1244
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:34,333
Her phone is out of reach.

1245
01:41:35,166 --> 01:41:37,208
I don't want to see her again!

1246
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:41,958
She has put me to shame!

1247
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,083
Who does she think she is?

1248
01:41:44,708 --> 01:41:46,125
I'm asking you!

1249
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:49,416
Do you know what a shock this is for me?

1250
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:51,208
My friends are congratulating me

1251
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:52,958
for my daughter's marriage

1252
01:41:53,041 --> 01:41:54,666
and I, her father, doesn't even know.

1253
01:41:56,041 --> 01:41:57,125
Disgusting!

1254
01:42:03,583 --> 01:42:07,375
What does this boy do? Who is he?

1255
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:10,375
Even I just found out this morning.
He's Vijay.

1256
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:12,916
He's only tagged everyone.

1257
01:42:13,416 --> 01:42:14,583
I think he's an estate agent.

1258
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:17,625
An estate agent?

1259
01:42:22,041 --> 01:42:22,958
Hello.

1260
01:42:23,583 --> 01:42:25,208
Yes, we don't know, Sanjeev.

1261
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:27,708
Even for us, we just saw it
on Facebook this morning.

1262
01:42:32,708 --> 01:42:34,333
I wonder who he's gotten married to.

1263
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:37,625
I had so many dreams of his marriage

1264
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,166
where he got married in a temple.

1265
01:42:40,208 --> 01:42:43,000
Mom, she's very pretty.

1266
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:45,666
Vijay has put her photo on Facebook, look.

1267
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:47,875
I don't want to see it.

1268
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:50,916
I'll see her in person, she's coming now.

1269
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:55,791
Vijay was always smart, I knew it.

1270
01:42:55,916 --> 01:42:57,583
He's caught a big fish.

1271
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:03,166
Don't sit and chat here.
Go and buy vegetables, I have to cook.

1272
01:43:03,291 --> 01:43:04,458
-Alright.
-You come with me,

1273
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:06,791
there's lots of chores to be done.

1274
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:10,541
We don't even know
which caste she belongs to.

1275
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:14,375
This boy burned all my desires to ash.

1276
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:32,041
Passengers please pay attention.
Platform number one, two, eight...

1277
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:56,625
You haven't gone
for a walk since two days.

1278
01:44:05,666 --> 01:44:07,000
When we were little,

1279
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,458
my grandma always told my father

1280
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:16,166
that you cannot teach your children
to be successful.

1281
01:44:17,916 --> 01:44:21,958
But they can be taught how to be happy.

1282
01:44:29,208 --> 01:44:30,833
I'll make tea for you.

1283
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:40,583
Look Vijay, we had fixed your marriage
with a dowry of 400,000 rupees.

1284
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:42,833
Will we get that money or not?

1285
01:44:45,208 --> 01:44:47,375
Is the girl from a poor family?

1286
01:44:48,833 --> 01:44:53,458
Mom, they are rich people.
You will get everything.

1287
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:56,208
Don't worry about it.
And she's sitting inside,

1288
01:44:58,625 --> 01:44:59,750
so speak softly.

1289
01:45:00,916 --> 01:45:02,875
Vijay, come here.

1290
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:09,125
-Yes, sister-in-law?
-Why is she so sad?

1291
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:12,291
Have you done something wrong to her?

1292
01:45:12,666 --> 01:45:14,375
No, of course not.

1293
01:45:15,041 --> 01:45:18,333
She must be tired, nothing else.

1294
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:29,583
-What happened?
-Nothing.

1295
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:32,583
It's nothing.

1296
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:36,041
You don't worry about it.

1297
01:46:01,708 --> 01:46:02,958
What happened, Neha?

1298
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:06,708
I know.

1299
01:46:09,208 --> 01:46:12,583
It takes some time to adjust in a village.

1300
01:46:13,666 --> 01:46:17,958
But with some time,
you will begin to like it here.

1301
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:24,375
You know, everyone in
the family is happy.

1302
01:46:25,708 --> 01:46:29,125
And why wouldn't they be?
You are so beautiful.

1303
01:46:33,125 --> 01:46:34,166
Actually,

1304
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,750
tonight is our nuptial night.

1305
01:46:40,458 --> 01:46:44,875
Neha... Neha. What happened?
Show it to me, dear.

1306
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:47,083
-Please go from here.
-Show me.

1307
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:49,916
-I'm fine.
-Show it to me.

1308
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,416
-Go from here. Please. Please go.
-Darling...

1309
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:13,750
You're back.

1310
01:47:18,708 --> 01:47:21,666
Where were you? I've been calling you.

1311
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:28,375
I'd gone to meet the lawyer,
to get the property papers made.

1312
01:47:30,916 --> 01:47:34,833
I've decided to transfer
half my property to Neha.

1313
01:47:36,833 --> 01:47:40,583
Tell Smita. Ask her to be ready.
We have to go meet Neha.

1314
01:48:08,416 --> 01:48:11,041
We lost our father 15 years ago.

1315
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:16,083
We are two brothers,
I am older and he is younger.

1316
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:19,875
We also have a younger sister.
That's our small family.

1317
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:23,708
I own a spare parts shop in the market.

1318
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:26,125
It's a small business.

1319
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:28,500
What does your spouse do?

1320
01:48:29,833 --> 01:48:30,708
Who?

1321
01:48:32,083 --> 01:48:33,916
She's asking about your husband.

1322
01:48:34,208 --> 01:48:35,250
Your husband.

1323
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:37,541
He's a civil engineer.

1324
01:48:39,333 --> 01:48:41,083
You didn't bring your kid along?

1325
01:48:44,166 --> 01:48:48,041
I have six, four sons and two daughters.

1326
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:53,458
In eight years of marriage,
I produced six kids.

1327
01:48:53,541 --> 01:48:55,500
Please call Neha.

1328
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:57,541
I'll call her.

1329
01:48:57,666 --> 01:49:01,875
Kids, go to your granny.

1330
01:49:04,416 --> 01:49:08,916
These kids, they will gobble up
all the snacks otherwise.

1331
01:49:10,625 --> 01:49:11,708
Why are you here?

1332
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:13,125
Leave, come in the evening.

1333
01:49:13,708 --> 01:49:14,833
Come and meet them.

1334
01:49:17,166 --> 01:49:18,875
How will I face them?

1335
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:22,333
You are educated.

1336
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:26,166
Why don't you tell them the truth?

1337
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,666
What do I say? That I was so drunk,

1338
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:34,333
I didn't realize how I got married?

1339
01:49:37,875 --> 01:49:38,958
Please eat.

1340
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:40,708
Smita.

1341
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,125
-No, thanks.
-Please have some.

1342
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:44,166
-No, thank you.
-

1343
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:50,541
Dad, these sweets are very famous here.

1344
01:49:50,666 --> 01:49:52,250
Yes, they are.

1345
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:55,625
-Please have.
-No, dad cannot eat it, he is diabetic.

1346
01:49:56,083 --> 01:50:00,416
Have it. Death will come when it has to.
Have it.

1347
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:02,541
Dad cannot have sweets, it's forbidden.

1348
01:50:04,916 --> 01:50:08,666
Let it be, why are you forcing them?

1349
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:12,708
It's okay.

1350
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:18,333
Look, this is how daughters are.
They care so much for their parents.

1351
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:24,583
We had so many dreams
about Vijay's marriage.

1352
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:30,333
She is not coming, she's feeling shy.

1353
01:50:31,333 --> 01:50:33,791
Your daughter is very shy.

1354
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:39,708
Your daughter will live here now.

1355
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:41,208
Neha.

1356
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:50,875
Stop crying.

1357
01:50:58,041 --> 01:50:59,666
Look at you!
What have you done to yourself?

1358
01:51:03,625 --> 01:51:05,708
You should have at least told me.

1359
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:08,041
You could have called.

1360
01:51:18,833 --> 01:51:20,250
What have you done?

1361
01:51:22,041 --> 01:51:24,708
Do you know how hurt mom and dad are?

1362
01:51:28,791 --> 01:51:31,000
Bhopal to Chapra is an eight hour journey,
right dad?

1363
01:51:32,125 --> 01:51:33,500
How long did it take you?

1364
01:51:37,416 --> 01:51:40,416
Please call Smita. We have to leave.

1365
01:51:41,541 --> 01:51:42,625
You could have stayed back today, dad.

1366
01:51:44,041 --> 01:51:45,625
Please call her.

1367
01:51:46,708 --> 01:51:47,750
Okay.

1368
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:56,041
Dad has brought the property papers.

1369
01:51:56,375 --> 01:51:58,541
He's transferred half the property
to your name.

1370
01:52:01,125 --> 01:52:02,250
Are you alright?

1371
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:07,958
-Smita, dad is calling you.
-Okay.

1372
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,416
I'm leaving. Take care.

1373
01:52:16,333 --> 01:52:17,375
Bye.

1374
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:19,916
Take care.

1375
01:52:34,125 --> 01:52:35,333
Dad, let's go.

1376
01:53:36,041 --> 01:53:37,416
You guys took very long.

1377
01:53:41,958 --> 01:53:44,500
How are those people?
What kind of people are her in-laws?

1378
01:53:45,166 --> 01:53:48,000
-And her house?
-Mom, I'm very tired.

1379
01:53:48,125 --> 01:53:49,375
Shall we talk tomorrow?

1380
01:53:57,791 --> 01:54:01,333
In dreams

1381
01:54:01,458 --> 01:54:04,083
Where is the dream?

1382
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,625
In sleep

1383
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:11,875
Where is sleep?

1384
01:54:12,458 --> 01:54:15,416
In dreams

1385
01:54:15,875 --> 01:54:19,333
Where is the dream?

1386
01:54:19,625 --> 01:54:22,458
In sleep

1387
01:54:23,083 --> 01:54:26,458
Where is sleep?

1388
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,083
There's just you

1389
01:54:30,375 --> 01:54:33,375
Only you!

1390
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:44,583
In breaths

1391
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:47,125
Where is the breath?

1392
01:54:48,708 --> 01:54:51,208
There's just you

1393
01:54:52,291 --> 01:54:55,708
Only you!

1394
01:55:10,333 --> 01:55:11,416
Look Manorama,

1395
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:15,541
I didn't have any personal enmity
with Neha.

1396
01:55:17,458 --> 01:55:19,000
She just had one problem.

1397
01:55:19,416 --> 01:55:20,958
She's a very bad actress.

1398
01:55:25,791 --> 01:55:27,041
But she wrote very well.

1399
01:55:28,958 --> 01:55:30,416
This song is so good.

1400
01:55:31,083 --> 01:55:32,583
Fabulous composition.

1401
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:35,708
A million hits on YouTube in two days!

1402
01:55:36,583 --> 01:55:38,708
The music company has called me
several times.

1403
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,791
Even today,
they have already called twenty times.

1404
01:55:42,041 --> 01:55:43,750
You know how these companies are.

1405
01:55:44,083 --> 01:55:47,500
They fear some other company
may sign Neha before them.

1406
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:51,166
So they want to sign her
on an exclusive basis.

1407
01:55:55,791 --> 01:55:57,250
Ask her

1408
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:01,125
to speak to the director at once.

1409
01:56:07,791 --> 01:56:09,375
Where is she these days, by the way?

1410
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:16,000
I don't know.

1411
01:56:19,083 --> 01:56:20,291
But I'll find out.

1412
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:26,458
Okay.

1413
01:56:38,125 --> 01:56:41,375
I'd like to walk such

1414
01:56:41,458 --> 01:56:45,333
That you become my journey

1415
01:56:45,583 --> 01:56:48,583
I begin my journey from you

1416
01:56:48,708 --> 01:56:51,916
And end it at you

1417
01:56:52,958 --> 01:56:55,250
Open my heart...

1418
01:56:55,375 --> 01:56:56,458
Dad.

1419
01:56:56,666 --> 01:56:59,291
You'll find yourself in it

1420
01:56:59,375 --> 01:57:03,500
She wasted so much time.
Why didn't she try music?

1421
01:57:03,833 --> 01:57:07,708
My daughter finally got her success.
She finally made you proud.

1422
01:57:08,708 --> 01:57:11,333
I always used to say she writes well.

1423
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:13,333
This song is now a super hit.

1424
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,500
Everyone is tuned in.

1425
01:57:15,708 --> 01:57:17,000
Call her, she'll be very happy.

1426
01:57:17,125 --> 01:57:19,916
You'd come back without meeting her.

1427
01:57:33,416 --> 01:57:34,625
How are you, Neha?

1428
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,458
Since we have gotten married,
I have not given you any gifts.

1429
01:57:46,041 --> 01:57:47,125
I bought it for you.

1430
01:57:50,541 --> 01:57:51,500
This.

1431
01:58:00,958 --> 01:58:02,916
Smita and your dad are very nice.

1432
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:06,125
They did right in transferring
the property to your name.

1433
01:58:06,416 --> 01:58:09,708
We will sell the property, go to Mumbai

1434
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:11,666
and start a business.

1435
01:58:12,083 --> 01:58:14,375
Or if you want to live with your dad,
we can go there too.

1436
01:58:14,625 --> 01:58:16,000
It will make him happy.

1437
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:21,500
Sister-in-law said you don't like it here,
so we won't live here.

1438
01:58:23,333 --> 01:58:24,416
Look Vijay,

1439
01:58:25,666 --> 01:58:29,000
I owe you a few favors
that you did for me in Mumbai.

1440
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:34,916
And I don't feel angry with you,
I feel pity for you

1441
01:58:37,416 --> 01:58:39,625
when I see you make
all these futile attempts.

1442
01:58:39,875 --> 01:58:42,083
Because none of them is workable.

1443
01:58:42,833 --> 01:58:44,750
Because forget others,

1444
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:46,916
I only loathe myself.

1445
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:00,541
Dad, remove my name
from the property papers,

1446
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:02,083
I don't want anything!

1447
01:59:02,875 --> 01:59:04,083
What happened, dear?

1448
01:59:04,208 --> 01:59:07,458
You always do the talking,
now listen to me.

1449
01:59:08,083 --> 01:59:09,708
You never listen to me.

1450
01:59:10,208 --> 01:59:12,375
I cannot take this anymore.

1451
01:59:14,041 --> 01:59:18,291
-Neha--
-I cannot handle anything, dad, I cannot!

1452
01:59:19,625 --> 01:59:21,250
-What happened, dad?
-What happened?

1453
01:59:22,166 --> 01:59:23,166
-What happened?
-She disconnected?

1454
01:59:23,291 --> 01:59:24,166
She disconnected?

1455
01:59:24,791 --> 01:59:28,166
And you, I neither like you nor hate you.

1456
01:59:28,833 --> 01:59:31,791
You don't exist in my life.

1457
01:59:32,458 --> 01:59:35,500
Go! Go away! Go!

1458
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:38,250
Go out!

1459
01:59:59,833 --> 02:00:01,708
You will oust me from my home?

1460
02:00:03,208 --> 02:00:05,166
Both father and daughter
made a fool of me.

1461
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:09,375
I don't exist, huh?

1462
02:00:11,083 --> 02:00:13,541
Then why are you living in my house?

1463
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:18,083
Okay, this was missing!

1464
02:00:18,166 --> 02:00:19,416
Your bloody father!

1465
02:00:21,958 --> 02:00:23,583
-No... no.
-Tell me, pimp!

1466
02:00:24,333 --> 02:00:25,208
-Vijay!
-Papa!

1467
02:00:25,291 --> 02:00:27,125
You will talk to Neha?

1468
02:00:27,708 --> 02:00:28,583
You two ruined my life.

1469
02:00:28,708 --> 02:00:29,583
-Vijay!
-Papa, one minute.

1470
02:00:30,083 --> 02:00:32,583
-Don't hit Neha.
-Dad, give it to me.

1471
02:00:32,708 --> 02:00:33,833
Is he beating her?

1472
02:00:34,541 --> 02:00:36,750
-You ruined my life!
-Vijay, don't beat me.

1473
02:00:36,875 --> 02:00:38,708
-Don't beat her.
-Vijay!

1474
02:00:38,791 --> 02:00:41,541
See what I do to you now!

1475
02:00:41,833 --> 02:00:43,750
You are very proud, aren't you?

1476
02:00:43,875 --> 02:00:46,083
-Papa!
-Vijay, don't beat her.

1477
02:00:46,208 --> 02:00:47,458
Please don't beat my daughter.

1478
02:00:47,583 --> 02:00:48,541
-Leave my daughter.
-Vijay!

1479
02:00:48,625 --> 02:00:49,958
-Take this!
-Vijay, don't!

1480
02:00:50,125 --> 02:00:52,166
-Here, see.
-I beg you.

1481
02:00:52,791 --> 02:00:55,166
Are you listening? Come and save her.

1482
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:59,000
-See how she is begging?
-Don't beat Neha, I beg you!

1483
02:00:59,291 --> 02:01:01,750
Listen! He's begging me.

1484
02:01:02,416 --> 02:01:03,291
Dad!

1485
02:01:03,541 --> 02:01:04,833
-Neha!
-You...

1486
02:01:04,916 --> 02:01:06,208
Vijay, don't beat her.

1487
02:01:06,958 --> 02:01:08,458
He's beating my daughter.

1488
02:01:11,541 --> 02:01:13,541
You will talk to her.

1489
02:01:13,791 --> 02:01:16,375
What will you say?

1490
02:01:16,791 --> 02:01:18,833
You bloody pimp!

1491
02:01:19,125 --> 02:01:20,791
How can you talk like that!

1492
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:25,041
I'll tell you all she's done.

1493
02:01:25,166 --> 02:01:26,041
Damn you!

1494
02:01:26,791 --> 02:01:29,333
-He is beating her.
-

1495
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:33,916
Now you are pleading with me?
And you didn't even want to see my face.

1496
02:01:34,708 --> 02:01:36,000
You came to my house

1497
02:01:36,458 --> 02:01:38,041
and humiliated me.

1498
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:40,208
-We are cheap?
-Vijay.

1499
02:01:40,833 --> 02:01:42,083
Vijay, open the door.

1500
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:43,416
-I am cheap?
-I plead with you, son!

1501
02:01:43,541 --> 02:01:46,500
Son? Now you are calling me son?

1502
02:01:46,583 --> 02:01:48,458
You didn't even want to
see my face earlier.

1503
02:01:49,083 --> 02:01:51,875
Vijay, I plead with you.

1504
02:01:52,166 --> 02:01:55,583
-Don't call me son, you pimp!
-

1505
02:01:55,666 --> 02:01:57,500
Vijay, open the door.

1506
02:01:57,583 --> 02:01:59,208
Listen to what your daughter
has been doing.

1507
02:01:59,291 --> 02:02:02,541
Vijay, I'll do all you say, open the door.

1508
02:02:02,708 --> 02:02:04,666
Your daughter was a whore.

1509
02:02:04,875 --> 02:02:08,041
-Don't say that.
-She wanted a new man every day.

1510
02:02:08,125 --> 02:02:09,166
Do you hear me?

1511
02:02:09,416 --> 02:02:12,166
She slept with one man
and woke up with another.

1512
02:02:12,416 --> 02:02:14,083
What upbringing did you give her?

1513
02:02:14,166 --> 02:02:17,791
Vijay, don't tell him anything,
he will die.

1514
02:02:17,875 --> 02:02:22,291
Yes, now I know! You made
all this property from pimping.

1515
02:02:22,666 --> 02:02:24,625
You must be selling
your older daughter too.

1516
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:25,833
That is why she is living with you.

1517
02:02:26,208 --> 02:02:27,833
And you call us cheap?

1518
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:29,333
And you call us cheap?

1519
02:02:29,416 --> 02:02:30,666
Now tell me who is cheap.

1520
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:32,958
Listen, your father is crying.

1521
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:35,000
He's calling me son now.

1522
02:02:35,625 --> 02:02:38,166
Rascal, lower your voice and talk to me.

1523
02:02:42,333 --> 02:02:45,416
Vijay, he will die.

1524
02:02:45,541 --> 02:02:47,958
Do you know what your daughter is now?

1525
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:50,083
I admit my mistake.

1526
02:02:50,333 --> 02:02:51,875
Shut up, you pimp!

1527
02:02:51,958 --> 02:02:53,458
Vijay.

1528
02:02:53,708 --> 02:02:58,166
I'll put the phone on speaker,
hear your daughter's torment.

1529
02:02:58,583 --> 02:03:00,958
Listen! And you... rot!

1530
02:03:04,291 --> 02:03:06,875
Now you understand?

1531
02:03:07,416 --> 02:03:10,750
Both father and daughter
want to humiliate me?

1532
02:03:10,916 --> 02:03:12,666
She ruined my life.

1533
02:03:13,458 --> 02:03:16,875
She was sleeping with men all drunk.

1534
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:20,208
She used to do all kinds of drugs.

1535
02:03:21,458 --> 02:03:23,750
She couldn't stay awake without them.

1536
02:03:42,916 --> 02:03:44,291
Just wait, rascal!

1537
02:03:45,166 --> 02:03:47,208
My existence...

1538
02:03:49,958 --> 02:03:50,916
Mom!

1539
02:03:51,875 --> 02:03:53,583
Mom! Mom!
