The first one did not find answer sense .. The second one still can not find answers together

5
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,509
But I need it the day Ayyar

I am alone

9
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:57,069
I know only two doctrines

10
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:59,678
Kill or die

11
00:01:00,513 --> 00:01:03,405

I have thousands of people in a village alone

The land that changed my life

The death of several people in three minutes, ten

18
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,819
I come alive so far.

Still have a right to tell her ... not interested in money, things got much my dad

She likes people a lot of money to get him .. I'm able false

00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:11,246
Hey everyone .. I go to the bar to tell Lynne R. Gold

Hello Babu

31
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:20,160
Why do not you sense that you give people money

Bar with friends, not going to the hospital ..

Dad said once more if you raævaṭaenavada

35
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:34,213
I will never forget my dad answered it ...

36
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:38,001
I would like to talk a lot younger, father and baby tiger

37

One child shout daesarayaeka his condition is tempting to lie tiger

38
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:46,302
But when my father was not a Tiger

39
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:51,334
Tiger came the third time really because the child really scream. I think not going to lie to my father

40
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:52,960
The son was not time left

41
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:58,687
Although not what Dad would've gone a third time? The child had survived

42
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:03,717
Only people living tattooing everything is

43
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:09,514
Hey ... my people do bad things, try to do fraud,

44
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,977
Do not care to know that fraud - all work

45
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:16,367
The little if any of the other things I do not care

46
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,422
My father explained to me a strange new thing too

47
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:27,391
Sweet is the responsibility of the wife to her vision. Children, a burden to bear with love

48
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:32,532
But according to my vision, one can not forget the memory of my father is

49
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:36,047
I am twenty-seven when my marriage was an Engagement

50
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,274
Church .. my dad like him so I'd like to

51
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:46,351
I liked him because of his father, my father liked

52
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:51,368
He's like me or not, I do not know, because I did not hear

53
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:56,570
He was not my last single morons baāsailaeānaāvaṭa

54
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,891
What a reason curfew, my father's death ...

55
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,142
I heard the noise of one kind NewsSri Pub

56
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:33,572
Down

57
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:37,150
The case happened many days passed

58
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,072
First, lift the car from the airport took the car back together

59
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:45,994
India went okay, my dad took the corpses from the ambulance

60
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:48,334
Our company's share price fell five

61
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:54,388
Dad's ashes were holding everything courage Parker left heart

62
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:57,170
Pain went pass

63
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:00,271
Relatives went to another

64
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:04,061
A few days later, my father lost ...

65
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,240
I accepted his work

66
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:14,842
There are all my dad ever more debilitating fear that I would know what they did .. fraud

67
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,193
My sister told me to go to my father's office room .. dad enough time to stay, although it go

68
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:26,892
He missed the first time in my life .. it felt could not imagine that happened so different.

69
00:07:27,204 --> 00:07:31,286
This is Mr. saāmabasaivaā. I really feel like his name tells.

70
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,084
I do not know about her father

71
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:37,912
He's not my father's friend .. not sahakaārayaekauta

72
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:43,131
My father was surprised at losing vayaisaāga. Less that one in the evening plane ticket

73
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,956
Until one evening, former

74
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,714
Everyone went to walk six

75
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,830
He's going to run five in the morning

76
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:51,870
.. Not for the health of his head a little bit because

77
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:57,221
About ten years ago, was not even tell his wife he pays with his money

78
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:03,151
This person then it has been heard. I've stopped there to talk with his wife cocked big loss

79
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:08,479
Then his wife got one too .. had to come with more to come that distance between their

80
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:12,144
Their communication is limited to the paper's board wanted

81
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:23,526
I came here for that kind of man're not my father, I felt strange ..

82
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:26,502
There was to be no wrong or somehow hundred fifty

83
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:31,495
Income and expenses are now going through a similar ..

84
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:37,120
Yet the income of real estate have gone bankrupt in all that we do availalata

85
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,780
Buildings, cars, deposits, gold,

86
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,264
All the money to haæraevavata

87
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:45,694
Hard work coming up

88
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:50,559
It's just not done down the road ōnata

89
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,591
There is an option

90
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:57,150
If the value of all your assets like stocks like.

91
00:08:57,435 --> 00:09:00,794
Market price of less than one plausible if he is to refuse lad

If you want. This is just waiting for you together with my brother

Do not ask anyone to say this will not give to one .the more

95
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:18,527
I do not have anything to say for what my father put off the illness

96
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,152
Payments divest the file shut.

97
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:26,566
This is not something new

98
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:29,230
This is often a very big ones.

99
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,613
Since two or three months later, without noises slowly start your business

100
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:36,597
If my father did not lose prestige?

101
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:38,074
He's gone now, right?

102
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,370
What I do not understand or your question?

103
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,347
Should those who cheat the money allocated to believe my father?

104
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,784
Should the family be kept honestly believe in you?

105
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:52,331
I can not imagine what to do ..

106
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,355
What happens, if my value

107
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:01,097
Please draw people to the streets for home value anywhere?

108
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:03,417
Sir, what about the sadhaāranayaida?

109
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,917
New intelligent answer there, sir?

110
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,027
Everyone's mind, if my dad cheating liar's stay

111
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:16,917
Whoever even thinks about her, thinks she should be a good one ..

112
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:20,237
Now you are probably things I'll answer

113
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:25,144
If you sign this paper to god you're only as taiyaāganaivaī mind.

114
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:31,996
Tiger extras

115

Are one of the signature depending jaubalai Hills? There are :? Amir PET

Five Star Hotel prefer? Sambar flows?

118
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:48,307
This one will determine the signature. Well thought decision

119
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:27,455
Since I do not want to think up exactly what

120
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:30,651
The practice is actually worth the value

121
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,893

Now you say that you or keep false hopes

126
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:58,291
We was to debate the issue next month .. The Engagement canceled ... tell your mom

127
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:12,878
Leave the table and went over to the engagement ring given to the church ...

I felt embarrassed .... think how head off straight out out ..

129

This time I could not imagine anything ..

130
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:27,470
Now what's left is not here to protect all property

131
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,626
He did not come out together, not ever her father ..

132
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:35,095
Brother actually did not come out of the family play

133
