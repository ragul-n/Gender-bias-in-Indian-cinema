1
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,135
'India was attached to
single string by 'Khadar'.

2
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,104
A Gandhian dream which was as big
as the independence of a nation.

3
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:08,778
The pride of ones own countrymen.

4
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:10,671
By giving the face of purity.

5
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:14,206
A Gandhian principle which
lead to complete independence.

6
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:18,312
He wished that 'khadar' should
evolve as a symbol of a culture.

7
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,147
After gaining independence.

8
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,689
The 'khadar' and the
politics it represented.

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,563
In the corridors of power and among
the people it emerged as a power.

10
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:30,162
In between the ruling
and creation of funds.

11
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:33,133
The shape and expression
of 'khadar' kept on changing.

12
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:34,762
In the corridors of power.

13
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:36,431
With the pomp in
abundance of money.

14
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,669
It became a representation
of a certain political culture.

15
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,542
The principles of Gandhiji. One
person who saw it as breath of life.

16
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,744
Had lived in our little Kerala.
He was called as CP by compatriots.

17
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,778
'Cherian Pakilomattom'. Who made
'pure politics' as the penance in life.

18
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,415
One hailed from Kajirapali.

19
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:59,322
A true Gandhian, who realized
politics is true service to the nation.

20
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,755
Wife Annakutty and three children.

21
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:04,430
Mamachan, Tom, Sally.

22
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,430
In the 10 acre land which was
obtained as ancestral property.

23
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:07,527
What is left out at present is...

24
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,835
...a small house and one acre
enclosure that is surrounded.

25
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,873
The all the rest is borrowed by
'politics based on principles'.

26
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:16,176
In the strike for existence.

27
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,873
During the early days of 80's.
The migration to Malabar.

28
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:23,878
In the northern regions of Kannur
district. Close to Karnataka forest.

29
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:27,249
A mountain village named
'Santhipuram'. Over there.

30
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:29,759
By clearing of ginger
forest, one six acre land.

31
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:32,488
For an average family that
is more than enough to live.

32
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:35,862
But again the politics
made CP, a debtor.

33
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:37,166
Without gaining anything.

34
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,629
Losing everything when
being suppressed to death.

35
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,635
On holding Mamachan's hand,
he pitifully looked.

36
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,731
Mamachan, knew the
meaning of that look.

37
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,746
The dreams of one entire family.
Mamachan took on his shoulders.

38
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:52,773
For that. He combed
off his own dreams.

39
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:58,851
He liked his father. But he hated his
politics which ruined everything.

40
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,654
Like that, that day has come.

41
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,485
The day which changed
Mamachan's route of life.

42
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,531
Mother! Mother!

43
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:17,631
Mother! Where have
you kept my shirt and all?

44
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:19,300
That will be there in the cupboard.

45
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:21,744
Where is it?

46
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,429
Father's only. With this let there
be some kind of use, like this.

47
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,622
Hey fellow! Look.

48
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:47,398
Okay good wearing it. Should
not commit any mischief.

49
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,431
How come Mamachan
is on 'Khadar' today?

50
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:52,566
There should be
something else, no?

51
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,441
Only this was left behind by father.

52
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,172
So thought of wearing this.

53
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,614
Brother, take this okay.
I'll come now.

54
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:04,586
Okay, okay.

55
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,349
It's some kind of problem.

56
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,252
Sir, don't push sir.

57
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:09,659
What happened?

58
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:11,755
Big playing with cards.

59
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:12,594
With money?

60
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,858
No, for a cup of tea.

61
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:17,459
Now what to do next?
Shall I go home and tell?

62
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,832
No, tell in his house.
Don't tell in my house.

63
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,296
Sir is calling you.

64
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,167
For what?

65
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,536
I'm not with them.

66
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:24,663
You are only called.

67
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,571
Go, come back only
after getting two.

68
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,480
Yes, come in.

69
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:42,383
There was no need of coming.

70
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,321
Could have at least
made a phone call.

71
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,320
They will be released
right now itself.

72
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:47,761
Sir, you may sit.

73
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,823
L...

74
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:51,800
Sit sir.

75
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:53,870
Not sitting little busy.

76
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:55,565
Sir your name?

77
00:05:58,508 --> 00:05:59,475
Mamachan!

78
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:08,684
“The silver owl
with the silica eyes“

79
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,154
“The silver owl
with the silica eyes“

80
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,456
On that day, the
politician as Mamachan.

81
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:19,257
No, the so called Khadar
dresser Mamachan was born.

82
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:22,295
After that Mamachan
has not removed the Khadar.

83
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,595
Then full fledged political worker.

84
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,102
While remaining in big parties...

85
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,605
...it was during the time had realized
won't reach beyond panchayat.

86
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,639
Uttar Pradesh resident
Anand Sharma.

87
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,833
A party called DNC was formulated.

88
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,511
There by Mamachan moved on to...

89
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,140
...DNC and became
follower of 'practical politics'.

90
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:43,446
Today Mamachan is the DNC's
youth Wing's national secretary.

91
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:46,522
The central minister Anand
Sharma is the God like figure.

92
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,691
The sacred places are
Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,624
This is the story of Mamachan.

94
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:54,528
The story of 'Khadar' which
was worn by Mamachan.

95
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,857
'After 22 years..'

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,365
That is Jose is it not?

97
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,609
That kind of going is by getting mad.

98
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,335
Actually is it there?

99
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,174
Or is it a mere eyes wash on us?

100
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:13,409
Yes, it is there.

101
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:14,648
Today morning while calling from...

102
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,346
...DCC, only I came to
know about the matter.

103
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,852
Yes.

104
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:18,849
Look, Jose.

105
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,355
Comrade, lal salam.(Red salute)

106
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:24,421
Go, ask.

107
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:25,461
We'll try.

108
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,125
Kutticha, go and ask.

109
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,225
Hey man, even if asked not
going to tell the truth and all.

110
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,693
Just go there.

111
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:35,838
Go.

112
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:38,404
All the ones who had drunk
has come, is it not?

113
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:39,704
Jose is waiting, go.

114
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,642
Now there will be no
one left out to know.

115
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:44,842
Jose! This...

116
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,413
Did you see that?

117
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:48,784
Hey man.

118
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:52,149
A vice president without any
respect towards opposition.

119
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,553
And one president.

120
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:58,320
Look.

121
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,695
I'm a good for nothing husband and.

122
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,665
I'm scared of you.

123
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,528
There is a talking in the village.

124
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,227
I'm only being decent like this...

125
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:10,272
...when getting cross, I'm
a contemptible fellow.

126
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,068
Do you know that?

127
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:13,576
Don't I know all that?
You don't bother all that.

128
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:18,513
Out here one person is luring
on you, I've a small doubt.

129
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,071
Yes, well who is this Jose?

130
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,085
Yes, that contemptible fellow only.
If I get him in my hand.

131
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,450
Will hit him and..Oh my heavens!

132
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:27,786
Jose, now only I've told about Jose
and put my tongue inside my mouth.

133
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:29,188
The tongue can be put
inside the mouth...

134
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,249
...can it be drained and
put on the hanger?

135
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:31,225
Can't be done.

136
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,158
The cow is standing in the
sun I'll move it and come now.

137
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:33,855
Jose shall I go?

138
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,598
Today also lost from the hand.

139
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:40,725
Why looking like this?

140
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,371
I've told a thousand
times to the president.

141
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,435
Without asking me
shouldn't do any matter.

142
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:51,173
For that what did I do?

143
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,375
To the ones who
are waiting outside...

144
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,746
...who told the matter of road?

145
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,376
Will she do like that?

146
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,546
That too, to me. No, no.

147
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,154
I only, today at 11 o'clock
there is an explanation...

148
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,452
...meeting which is to be held.

149
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:02,355
Ruined!

150
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,220
Can't you do all this by asking me?

151
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,362
I had called Josettan.

152
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,231
Told outside the network.

153
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:12,491
But still...

154
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,498
...anger will come, no?

155
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,605
Is it that big problem?

156
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,642
My president such a project is
for the first time in our area.

157
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:24,304
The estimated cost is 2 crore.

158
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,179
Central government's village
development special project.

159
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,742
All the illicit pregnancy of the
centre are created by me...

160
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,583
...one is saying like that
and walking out there.

161
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,622
The national leader Mamachan.

162
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,524
On previous day, about this same
road. In our Kunjikutty's tea shop.

163
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,084
I've heard him talking about this.

164
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:39,594
Is it?

165
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,791
Eating the jack fruit from my house.
And sitting in front of my house.

166
00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:44,197
This Mamachan is a
person who is like that.

167
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,462
Stupid fellow!

168
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,125
Once if we don't play carefully.

169
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,805
This also will be taken by him okay.

170
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:50,431
Will it be a problem?

171
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,677
As far as I've known, Mamachan
will come only after 5th.

172
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,210
For the time being the president
at the explanation meeting.

173
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,544
Need not have to give
big explanation and all.

174
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,877
Let me think.

175
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:05,882
What can be done.

176
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,690
Let me also think, fellow.

Today, is the day of happiness.

217
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,461

Today it's going to be materialized.
Over here.

Such a beautiful welcome
that is staged for me.

222
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,774
To all in the language of heart.

223
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:06,775
I'm telling my thanks.

224
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,805
This is also gone from
the hands of Jose.

225
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:09,667
Truly.

226
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:13,774
Truly to get a project like this
for our panchayat, reason for it is...

227
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,748
...they are two personalities.

228
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,213
Can anyone tell who they are?

229
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:18,584
Who is it?

230
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,645
Your father and mother.

231
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:23,191
<i>Yes, our respected panchayat
president Ms. Show and...</i>

232
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,790
...vice president respected Mr. Jose.

233
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,128
They are that big two personalities.

234
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,358
Till yesterday, he was
a person who told...

235
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,866
...Jose should be beaten and killed...

236
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,297
...only then this area
will turn out to be good.

237
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,529
What happened to him?

238
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:37,300
Dear ones, I remember.

239
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:39,364
For the last so many days.

240
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,169
<i>Respected Ms. Show Jose.</i>

241
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:44,410
<i>Ms. Show Mathew.</i>

242
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,413
And Mr. Jose.

243
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,642
With a demand to
execute this project.

244
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:49,651
Several times had come to meet me.

245
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,185
Many vital secrets, I...

246
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:51,652
When was it?

247
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:52,210
Who knows.

248
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,517
...shared with president.

249
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:56,320
Because of that, this time at Delhi.

250
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:59,157
With the rural development minister
Sharmaji, I spoke about this matter.

251
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,463
Also gained a supporting decision.

252
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:05,496
Immediately after meeting Sharmaji
and came out, I called Jose and...

253
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,830
...l, informed this happy news.

254
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:07,726
Is it not Jose?

255
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:09,501
Yes.

256
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,373
In this occasion.

257
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,374
I would like to remind one more thing
to president and Jose, that I wish.

258
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,408
Your responsibilities to the
panchayat is not ending here.

259
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,183
The needs in here, which is
well known better than me.

260
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,714
As a local leaders, you are the ones.

261
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,411
Because of that should study each
and every problems in panchayat.

262
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:27,313
Should have open
discussions with people.

263
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:28,788
Then you should come
and meet me. Okay.

264
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:29,518
Then what?

265
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:32,152
If it's a genuine request
we can find a solution on that.

266
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:35,160
I'll be there.

267
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,666
We still have to move ahead.

268
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:40,630
For that as one among
you, as one with you.

269
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,804
Like so far, I'll be always
there with you.

270
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,638
On these topics they have got
the caliber to talk authentically.

271
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,274
Our Jose and president.

272
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:48,132
I'll talk.

273
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:48,643
Go, go.

274
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:49,744
But...

275
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,813
...since they have not got nothing
more to talk, than I spoke.

276
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:53,508
Duped!

277
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,518
For the presidential address, I
welcome Ms. Jameela Asif to dias.

278
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,582
For all my thanks and greetings.

279
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,013
'Can you do like this?'

280
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,091
'Can you do without informing?'

281
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:08,494
'The beans and porridge is for us'

282
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:09,793
On telling the opposition
was not informed.

283
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,391
Under the leadership
of Maniyan Kuttichan.

284
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,300
Kunjumon and followers are doing sit
down strike in front of panchayat.

285
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,236
For that there is no one
over there is it not?

286
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:16,703
Where?

287
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,104
It's not necessary
that they need people.

288
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:20,209
They are lot of filthy people like that.

289
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,379
Here comes a thing, which
is not included in any of these.

290
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,478
'A silver owl'.

291
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:25,774
Greetings.

292
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:29,546
Look how he goes.

293
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:31,379
We can play cards.

294
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,148
Then get up and come.

295
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:32,710
Okay then.

296
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:35,824
Brother will it go today?
There are things to do after going.

297
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:36,750
Asking what is it?

298
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:39,225
Hello Gopi.

299
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:43,156
What Swami?

300
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,629
Then didn't say anything to me.

301
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,396
Hey, yesterday I was at Delhi, only.

302
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:51,567
Is it so? Reached just now only.

303
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:53,504
One inauguration.

304
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:57,779
Can't be left alone like that, no?

305
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,649
Okay then.

306
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:03,652
Aren't you coming man?

307
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:04,515
Then what?

308
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:05,418
Sit in the back.

309
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,614
There are no vehicles after this.

310
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:07,656
Who are these people?

311
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:09,347
Then shall we go?

312
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:13,825
To where was the journey?

313
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:15,856
At Delhi, there was
a central committee.

314
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,256
Mamachan, will you
become a minister soon?

315
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:29,411
Mamachan, money!

316
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,445
No need you keep it.

317
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,312
Shameless fellow, simply going
by wearing white and white.

318
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,285
Pull, pull!

319
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,183
Have made my father
to pull a lot is it not?

320
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:44,752
Children.

321
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:46,589
Uncle.

322
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,654
Take this.

323
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,463
Uncle, what did you bring?

324
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,898
There was nothing at the shop.

325
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:53,166
Hey girl, come lets go and play.

326
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:53,600
Wait fellow!

327
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,798
Hey boy! Have you returned
after roaming? Silly fellow!

328
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,863
Like you fooling the compatriots.

329
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:01,439
Fooling this children, that is not
possible my dear Mamachan.

330
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,274
Your some character they will
also get some of it, is it not?

331
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:05,075
Old lady, didn't it die?

332
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:06,081
No, you shameless fellow!

333
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:06,547
My heavens!

334
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:09,381
Your father was an
excellent congress worker.

335
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:12,111
Have always made the
compatriots to talk good about him.

336
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:13,121
For that what is there, now?

337
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,189
To make the compatriots talk,
you are also not bad at all!

338
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:20,654
Not that, today also some how
managed to sit in front of jeep, no?

339
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,256
Then what? Can one sit on top.

340
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,594
Last day while going to
church, heard someone talking.

341
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:29,294
As you can't sit in the front.
You won't get inside an auto.

342
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,765
While going to a marriage house,
should become a marriage boy.

343
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,438
While going to a house
where the death has occurred...

344
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,841
...should lie inside the coffin!

345
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:39,376
On hearing the people talking,
will feel like peeling off the skin!

346
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:42,549
A son born to spoil
the name of the father!

347
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:43,583
That father's name is...

348
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:46,213
...written in a notice and send by
the bank. The acquisition notice!

349
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:47,379
It is also good old
lady knows that one also.

350
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,682
If at all such a acquisition
notice has come.

351
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:51,451
By cheating anyone you must
have paid that one also...

352
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:52,892
...this mother knows that.

353
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:54,527
Indeed! I stopped that practice!

354
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,292
Mother's dear son is there, no?
Village officer.

355
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,365
Tell him to stop self saving.
Tell him to pay off that one.

356
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,595
Yea, best.

357
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:03,536
After getting a glass of water
from him. I don't think I can die.

358
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,573
So, you know the things.

359
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,438
I know fellow, I know everyone.

360
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:08,838
Look, that girl Sally has come.

361
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,237
So what? Do I've to
climb the coconut tree?

362
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:15,173
Today also, was she mood out?

363
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:19,585
Who knows. The village officer and
the princess wants another house.

364
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:22,786
Kind of nuisances.
- Come mother.

365
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,230
Not that Sally. Why are you here?

366
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,700
I came to see brother only.
- Is it?

367
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:37,540
In their place, told there is a girl
suited for you. Shall we go and see?

368
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,574
I've told you, not to come
here saying the marriage topic.

369
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:43,145
How many proposals
have you brought?

370
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:44,345
Out which half was
canceled by you.

371
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:45,380
And the other half canceled
by your husband.

372
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:46,381
This is not like that.

373
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:46,711
Then?

374
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,682
It seems that family is suited to us.

375
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,112
Haven't you seen the girl?

376
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:52,617
What is the age? That was told.

377
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,214
In this December, 32 will be over.

378
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,593
Your father in law is staying alone
at house as a widower, no?

379
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:58,455
Tell him to marry.

380
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,659
32 years of age.

381
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,595
Then what do think what
age you will get?

382
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:02,621
Only okay, when received like that.

383
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:03,494
Then what?

384
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:06,466
Mamacho, do you know
what is your age now?

385
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:07,730
Mother, not because of that.

386
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,537
After 24, 25 when our Christian
girls remains at home...

387
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:11,664
...it seems there is something wrong.

388
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:13,667
Then after 40, you
are remaining, no?

389
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:15,370
There is nothing wrong in that is it?

390
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:18,442
This old lady won't let
to drink rice gruel.

391
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,640
Ho! My mother!

392
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:20,581
What is it?

393
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,242
That flow is gone!

394
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,550
That is brother, mother
is simply telling 32 and all.

395
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,350
Good girl, brother will like her.

396
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:28,624
Has the brother in law seen?

397
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:29,552
No!

398
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,650
Then nothing more to think.
That idiot will cancel it.

399
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,607
No, no need. I'm not there.

400
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:50,305
Go, go!

401
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,813
Shall I jump and come over there?

402
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:54,816
Hey girl. Come here.

403
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:01,587
See this.

404
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,583
What is it mother?

405
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:07,426
What? Allergy on flower.

406
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:09,555
Looks like Pachan has
come since very long.

407
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:10,631
I came just now only.

408
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,063
Then you should have called, no?

409
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:13,101
I called. Didn't you hear?

410
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,430
There was wax picker
in the ears, no?

411
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:15,197
Then how are the things?

412
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,102
Come, will tell.

413
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,400
Hey man.

414
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:18,804
Yes.

415
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,736
Jose won't lift his head
again for some time now.

416
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,805
Yesterday I've given
such a task on him, no?

417
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:26,407
Can I ask one thing. You instead
of busting after Jose.

418
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,143
Can't you become at
least a ward member?

419
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,509
Hey man, Pachan.

420
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:32,283
I have entered into politics not just
to become a mere ward member.

421
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,084
All those things I've
not dreamt in dreams.

422
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,749
Not because the
compatriots not allowing, is it?

423
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:36,624
Hey man.

424
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:40,527
You wait and see. When the DNC
joins in any one of the fronts in...

425
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,621
...Kerala. On that day
Mamachan will fly to Delhi.

426
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,097
All that flying we will do later.

427
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,292
Look, I've arranged
a good task against Jose.

428
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:47,163
Is it necessary, that fast?

429
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:47,794
It's required.

430
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:50,468
A thing that is not seen
by compatriots so far.

431
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,198
What is that man?

432
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,240
Come, will show you.

433
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:52,797
Is it so?

434
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,368
Cleaning the courtyard, no?

435
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,605
No fixing the porotta!

436
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:57,745
What all things he should know.

437
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,372
It looked like as if
cleaning the courtyard.

438
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:04,379
But still, I never thought he
will do such a thing like this.

439
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,317
Jose, how can you bear this?

440
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,258
Jose, you drink this.

441
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,323
Go man.

442
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,694
Then all of you just move back.

443
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,161
Just move back brother.

444
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,459
Let Jose get some air!

445
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,363
Have you informed the president?

446
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,133
How can I say this to president?

447
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,328
Before people starts gathering, Jose
do something what is there to do.

448
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:26,170
'For Santhipuram-Jayagiri road'

449
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,141
'For allotting rupees 2 crores,
DNC national secretary...'

450
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:27,801
'...Saluting Mr. CP Mamachan'

451
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,538
However a thing like this.

452
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:30,773
At our junction it's for the first time.

453
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,578
What?

454
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,205
'Plusk' (Flex)

455
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,442
What?
- Pluske...

456
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:34,807
Why there are crowd over there?

457
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,709
Look, written about Jose.

458
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,443
Greetings.

459
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:39,848
Hey man.

460
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,758
How come there is a
gathering over here?

461
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:50,362
Lord, did Mamachan die?

462
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:56,197
'Death will come one day
Remember that, you human being'

463
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:03,744
'Your actions in life
Will also come along'

464
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:09,813
'Do the good deeds
Without laziness'

465
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,177
Leave the hand, leave the hand.

466
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:17,589
'Death will come one day
Remember that, you human being'

467
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,651
What happened to him?
It was chest pain.

468
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:20,796
What a pity!

469
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:22,756
He has got one boy, no?
Charley or something.

470
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,631
Who knows where he is. Long back
he has snatched Kunjukutty's radio.

471
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,463
What time is it said
the body will be taken?

472
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,468
Jose!

473
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:30,133
Come fast man.

474
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,510
Have a sight on the coffin!

475
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,342
Not on the coffin, must
have a sight on you only.

476
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,255
Here!

477
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:51,819
Go and take man.

478
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:57,589
Again Jose became an ass!

479
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,792
Where is our wreath?

480
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,658
Something bigger might have come.

481
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:02,328
No need, no need to stand.

482
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:05,670
Will go.
- Okay.

483
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,372
Urgently give it to
newspaper office. Go.

484
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,181
Jose!

485
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:16,383
Come here.

486
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,716
Did you inform Charley?
- To where?

487
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:22,722
When is the cremation?
- At 10. Has gone to pick up father.

488
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,254
Do one thing. Tell father to do
the cremation at the evening.

489
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:28,354
Let me search for Charley.

490
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:31,462
Otherwise what is the use
of saying a compatriot!

491
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:34,532
By unloading 3 or 4 chairs and
to tie a sheet and to drink soda.

492
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,866
Anyone can do that.

493
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,265
Tell father that I've told.

494
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,307
Okay.

495
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:42,867
Look, whom are you calling?

496
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:43,873
Calling father.

497
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:45,511
Mamachan told to change
the time of cremation.

498
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,208
Brother did you get high or what?

499
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,149
Don't you know he is mad?
What without cremating the person?

500
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:50,819
Simply bluffing and gone.
Come here.

501
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,251
Will drink soda. Come.

502
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:53,780
Why did you pay rupees thirty?

503
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,415
A person without control.

504
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:56,652
Brother!

505
00:22:57,393 --> 00:22:59,191
My dear brother.

506
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,227
What did you do on her?
Didn't do anything.

507
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,628
Which is this item?
- Sister only.

508
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:05,690
Brother..Take me also.

509
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:08,203
Take me also..Brother!

510
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,299
What is this old lady saying?

511
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:11,567
What?
- To take her also.

512
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,631
What, is he going on
a tour to 'Veegaland'?

513
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,410
No need to laugh and all.
Learn that lying.

514
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,446
Soon will have to lie.
- Go man!

515
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,475
Is everything over?
- I had told to come early.

516
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,517
There is no one here.
Hey look!

517
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:25,518
Will go.

518
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,261
Going on reverse.

519
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:42,871
Ho! You keep rubbing like this.
Brother is going to leave. Go.

520
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:44,603
Go man, to that side.

521
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,537
Mother, I'm leaving.
Brother just wait.

522
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:49,574
Wanted to tell one thing.
What is it?

523
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,677
That is..Regarding the
partition of the property.

524
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:53,442
Thomacha!
- Mother you keep quite!

525
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,142
Brother has not told
anything on it so far.

526
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:56,275
What should I say on that?

527
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,417
In my name there is
no property to partition.

528
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,148
We don't want anything
which is in anyone's name.

529
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,418
Just give, those ones
which we have the right.

530
00:24:03,092 --> 00:24:04,753
Hey fellow, the agreement of
the property is at the bank.

531
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:06,591
Without clearing that debt,
it's difficult to conduct partition.

532
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:09,154
It's not that the debt can't be
cleared off, it is not clearing it.

533
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,660
Say what is my share? I'll give that.

534
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,362
There is no use if you give anything.

535
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,095
Not that what have you got
to do, on dividing this now?

536
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:16,763
Is it to boil it and eat?

537
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,331
I'm looking for a transfer to a place
which has got little more facilities.

538
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,532
After selling this only, I can
escape from this village.

539
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:22,510
What to sell?

540
00:24:22,578 --> 00:24:24,808
It's father's property, I won't
allow to sell this.

541
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:26,639
I know very well what
to do with my share.

542
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,241
Stop it fellow! This house
and property is in my name.

543
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:30,683
Here you don't have a share.

544
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:31,720
You go and give the case.

545
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:34,450
There is lot of wealth with
you, that is earned by you.

546
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,855
With that you move apart.
- Mother!

547
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,586
You only have to move apart, no?
Not obstinate that it must be sold.

548
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:44,292
Will do the facility for that.
- Not simply saying will do.

549
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:45,891
Within this month something
has to be done.

550
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,727
Will do it fellow.
- Come girl!

551
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:51,164
Mother why did you talk like that?

552
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,208
Not talked, was made to talk, is it?

553
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:57,143
Started for a long time ago. Only
the thing I've not told all this to you.

554
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:59,476
Give it mother.
Let him do what he likes.

555
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:01,539
I won't give a single
grain of sand to him.

556
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,243
Right from beginning you had
been struggling for this family.

557
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,221
Then after he got a job and on
being able to stand on own feet.

558
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,382
Did he think of you?

559
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,590
Elder brother was made to wait.
Younger brother married.

560
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,187
Now wants to stay separate.
Here guy is getting old...

561
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,663
...and tooth starts growing
through the nose.

562
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:17,699
Mother!

563
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:21,494
Keep this sack inside.

564
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,399
Aren't you going to Trivandrum?

565
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:25,668
For what?
That flow is gone.

566
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,135
Since dressed up like this. Will
show it to compatriots and come.

567
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:36,515
Hey you. Hey Mamacha.

568
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,244
Stop there.
Stop.

569
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:40,184
It was father, no?

570
00:25:40,255 --> 00:25:41,780
Come Mamachan.
Get on the vehicle fast.

571
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:42,380
For what?

572
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:43,820
Get on it.
You get on it.

573
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:44,854
Father tell the matter.

574
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,856
You keep quite.
I'll tell.

575
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,291
Should I sit at the back?
Why not I come in the jeep?

576
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:50,661
No need, we'll go in this vehicle.

577
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:51,393
Is it?

578
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:08,516
Has the place reached?

579
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:11,484
You just push.
- What to push?

580
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:14,818
Me?
Never in my life, so far...

581
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,722
Push man like that. Why man didn't
you eat anything in the morning?

582
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:19,386
My heavens! I forgot that.

583
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,427
Then I'll go and eat
something and come, okay.

584
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:23,390
Mamacha, where are you going?

585
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,330
Push man.

586
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:26,091
Father only told no?
To eat and come.

587
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:28,197
A father who doesn't
value the words.

588
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:31,171
Throw this thing here
and why not go walking?

589
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,237
Mamachan, you are
over weight, okay.

590
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:44,786
Mamacha, come.

591
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:49,186
Look, this is our community church.

592
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:53,161
A good church. Is it to tell this father
made me to push vehicle this far?

593
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,128
So, you know that is it?

594
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,632
Then there are certain
things which you don't know.

595
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,222
What is it?

596
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,201
A thing like this is here
for a very long time.

597
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:03,064
On the intermediate days,
holy mass one each.

598
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:06,403
And on Sundays, two holy
masses are the practice.

599
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:07,499
No need to break the practice.

600
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:10,410
On seeing your mother's
sorrow. I gave her a word.

601
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:12,808
That I'll bring you and make you
stand in this church enclosure.

602
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,372
I kept my word.

603
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:19,252
Since it's father, can't scold also.

604
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:22,183
Who are you to postponed the
cremation of Mathanchettan?

605
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,158
That is because to find this Charley.

606
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,190
Then did you find Charley?

607
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,818
No.

608
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:28,154
One leader has come.

609
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,559
This is some what
an unfair play.

610
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:35,831
He is the one who has not
seen church after the baptism.

611
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:37,572
Telling to change the
time of cremation.

612
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,833
Other than cremation can
the church be changed?

613
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:43,608
Pacha, you take some one's
vehicle and come to the church.

614
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,247
What at the church?

615
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,208
Why do you want to go
to unwanted places?

616
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:49,408
Didn't you know.
It's our father's burial.

617
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:50,178
Burial?

618
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:51,511
Yea, tell everyone.

619
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:54,684
Lord, has the father died?

620
00:27:55,424 --> 00:28:05,766
(A Choir song)

621
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:13,458
Hey man, what is all this?

622
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:15,536
As Mamachan must
place the wreath first.

623
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:17,763
Without informing anyone. Came in
full speed. By turning on the lights!

624
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:19,131
Take this and place it.

625
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:20,641
You put on your chest and
lye down at that tomb.

626
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:21,436
Why is that?

627
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,501
When father scolded me, I just
told out of that ill-feeling only.

628
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:25,239
Look, don't show this kind of acts.

629
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,180
Am I mad to buy this wreath with
the money which was scarce?

630
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:28,683
So you have got the money to
buy the wreaths and all, no?

631
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,479
On telling to charge this for
Rs. 50, you don't have that.

632
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:32,486
Which is this monument stuff?

633
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:36,114
While purchasing this on the way
of return, good condition, 84 model.

634
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,283
More than that fancy number also.

635
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,190
1866!

636
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,228
Looks like a new vehicle.

637
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:43,194
Since we have come all this
way, why not bless this one?

638
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:45,495
First see whether this will
travel and then you bless this.

639
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,192
This one. Mamachan get in.

640
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,103
Will I get septic?

641
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:51,432
For you! What to do with this?

642
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:55,166
Will keep it safe, some
worthless fellow will die for sure!

643
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,413
Now does this thing also require
pushing? - Will correct this now.

644
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,244
It's in a very good condition, is it?
- Yes, yes.

645
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:14,454
Hey man, which is that girl?

646
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,397
I don't know.

647
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:43,423
I've also wished only
this much of beauty.

648
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,219
Mamachan, that is too less.

649
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:49,228
You are a problematic person, okay.

650
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,163
Mamachan, it's regarding the
case of going to Delhi.

651
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,266
Will see fellow.

652
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,366
Only this saying is there and
then doing this slavery work.

653
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,560
Then what about taking
you to Calicut?

654
00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:58,170
Don't make me to talk.

655
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,364
Then who else will say?

656
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,140
In the hot sun, at Calicut town...

657
00:31:01,209 --> 00:31:02,438
...four plus three a
procession of seven people.

658
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:03,808
You, decently inside the jeep.

659
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:05,837
Don't laugh okay.

660
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:08,716
Mathachan did a big cheating.

661
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:09,546
What man?

662
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,177
Should have died after
the arrival of that son.

663
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:12,687
For that he has not gone
to Dubai for a job.

664
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:14,188
He went eloping at the age of 12.

665
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:15,553
No doubt why he
became an opposition.

666
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:17,189
Just move a bit to that side.

667
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:18,124
Has come.

668
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:19,524
Kunjukutty, one half tea.

669
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:22,128
All of you, about whom
are you gossiping?

670
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:23,858
We were just saying things
about that Mathachan...

671
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:25,565
...who died and was just laughing.

672
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:29,428
Kunjukutty, after each day.

673
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:32,569
The 'vada' is becoming smaller
and smaller, it's like a marriage ring.

674
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:34,574
All should only take the notice
of 'vada' becoming smaller.

675
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,611
No one should notice the hole
in it becoming bigger, okay.

676
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:39,146
That is true, look at this.

677
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:41,573
I'm going write it in the account.

678
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:45,819
What is the use of him coming
here and drinking the tea?

679
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:46,548
Why is that?

680
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:48,851
Had an excellent wife.

681
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:51,392
That one eloped with
the black smith, no?

682
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:54,627
Even otherwise earlier
also she was a flirt.

683
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:58,257
How many times she had come
to flirt with me. He is a poor guy.

684
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,700
But I'll blame him only. If it's male
means there should be a control.

685
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:01,429
That must be there.

686
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,835
If the males doesn't have the
control. If anyone lures the wife.

687
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,698
Wife will go along with him.
- That is correct.

688
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:08,099
That is all my wife.
My friends.

689
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:11,804
If anyone comes home.
Only half of her face will be seen.

690
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:17,317
Get down.
Careful. Careful.

691
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:25,125
While fell in the gutter came and hit.

692
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,355
The other half will be
on Jose, is it not Kochappi?

693
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:29,261
If you say unwanted things
I'll hit you okay.

694
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:33,796
Lal Salam.
- Lal Salam is your father.

695
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:35,168
A strong tea.

696
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:38,605
I need a glass of hot water.
- Let it be a boiling one.

697
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:41,439
What is there to laugh on this?

698
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,807
Jose where are you going?

699
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,347
Has got some jobs
at the panchayat.

700
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:47,242
Yes, yes.

701
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,674
Don't take the tea now.

702
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:52,814
All the activities of the Jose are
for the development of our panchayath...

703
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,448
...on thinking that, one relief.

704
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,484
Jose is developing no?

705
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,293
Who is this with Jose?

706
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:02,162
That is our road contractor, no?

707
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:05,123
This is some kind of dealings.

708
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:08,266
May be some task
against Mamachan.

709
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:10,597
Say it's against Jose.

710
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:14,700
All the tasks against Mamachan,
will boomerang to him, is it?

711
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,177
Why there is no light and all?

712
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,515
Has he sold the house or what?

713
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:35,688
Why mother has not slept so far?

714
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:40,262
What happened?

715
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,570
What for mother is crying?

716
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:44,536
I've not cried and all.

717
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,233
Ho! Were you laughing,
weren't you?

718
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:50,570
Where are they?
- They, went to her house.

719
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,813
The child told, will come
only on day after tomorrow.

720
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,709
What have you decided?

721
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,319
Where he wants, will give 10 cents
of land and money to built house.

722
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:01,287
What else to do?

723
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,117
While thinking the kids were taken.

724
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,424
On taking the kids, what is use of
jetting the mucus from the nose?

725
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:12,458
My dear mother, you stop crying.

726
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:17,099
Hey Mamachan, you don't avoid
the marriage proposals like this.

727
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,401
When I die, there will be
no one for you.

728
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,268
Avoiding?

729
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:23,837
Me? The Lord won't pardon!

730
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:26,848
On getting the right one, will
marry now that is the situation.

731
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:29,875
I'll set the rice gruel.

732
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:34,154
My heavens!

733
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:36,383
Before serving the rice gruel please
see that the hands are washed!

734
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,119
Go man you useless fellow!

735
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:41,387
Started the program!

736
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,295
This is as if lying in
a government hospital.

737
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:48,298
Thinking to sell the house and
enclosure and go to somewhere.

738
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:51,169
Telling uncle, what kind of an
uncle is this any way?

739
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:57,343
'Big victory for the
Trinamool congress'

740
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,875
'Including Kerala, in 5 states the
election commission is going...'

741
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:02,276
'...ahead, with the
preparation of elections'.

742
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,588
'To increase Rs 5 per month for the
cooking gas, the central petroleum...

743
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:16,758
Who is this is it Cheguvera or what?

744
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:26,768
Why man, why are
you in this dress?

745
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:28,803
That is today is our
wedding anniversary.

746
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,736
Is it?

747
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:32,337
In the 11th party congress
at the main entrance gate.

748
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:34,280
When I was wearing this same dress
and sweating at that time only...

749
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,817
I and she met for the first time.

750
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:39,109
That is how fell in love
also, it is in the memory of that.

751
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:39,745
How is it?

752
00:35:39,821 --> 00:35:41,687
Very good, great.

753
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:42,888
Is the president in here?

754
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:43,750
President.

755
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,183
Come, come inside.

756
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:47,822
Who is this Mamachan is it?

757
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:49,320
Yea.
- Why early in the morning?

758
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,291
Just came to see the president.

759
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,233
Look, go and take the tea.
- Me?

760
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:55,235
No need of tea and all, okay.

761
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:56,236
That is a custom here.

762
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,462
He has told he doesn't want no?
- Go!

763
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,807
What is that president what
is in front of my enclosure...

764
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,272
...is it not a path?

765
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:04,535
Or is it that I, don't
belong to this panchayat?

766
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:06,376
Why tarring is avoided
only in that area?

767
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,414
That, that is Mamacha, that
is different two projects.

768
00:36:09,484 --> 00:36:10,474
Is it? Let me hear.

769
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:11,451
Tea and coffee!

770
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,448
Is this the two projects?

771
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,854
That is not the thing, asking which
one do you want tea or coffee?

772
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,218
Coffee will do.

773
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,385
Now its clear otherwise I'll get
confused because of doubting.

774
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,723
Then tea is it?

775
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:21,590
That is Mamacha.

776
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:24,455
From 'Tundipadi' to
upwards one 200 metres.

777
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,600
From the 'Alingathazathe house'
to downwards one 600 meters.

778
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,535
That is a special kind of project.

779
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,709
In between this there is only my
property, no? Which is 100 meters.

780
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,612
Do one thing, for the time being
merge the two and do it as one.

781
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:40,744
That is not possible.

782
00:36:40,815 --> 00:36:43,409
There are lot of other problems
which Mamachan doesn't know.

783
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:45,313
So the things are like that.

784
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,814
Then there are some other problems
which president doesn't know.

785
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:48,851
Shall I tell?
- Do you have sugar?

786
00:36:49,391 --> 00:36:49,789
What?

787
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:51,155
Not that, do what want
sugar for the tea.

788
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,288
My husband if he doesn't,
want he'll say that.

789
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,260
Not that generally those people who
come to see you, they usually...

790
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:57,765
mused to have a slight
problem with sugar.

791
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:58,458
Look!

792
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,557
So the sugar is required is it?

793
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:01,498
I'll put it okay.

794
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:05,137
What is that Mamachan
is trying to say?

795
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:06,230
No nothing at all.

796
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:08,167
That medical store license which is
at Karthikapuram is still now in...

797
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:09,335
...president's name is it?

798
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:10,242
Is it so?

799
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:11,804
Think it is like that only.

800
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,544
But during the time of election
in the details of the property.

801
00:37:14,616 --> 00:37:16,812
That is not mentioned.

802
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:17,608
Just take a look at this.

803
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,121
Mamachan, where did you get this?

804
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:25,454
The right to information.

805
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,757
Trying to scare me by showing this?

806
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,562
This is not a big deal is it?
Like losing the head and all,

807
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:37,094
No the head won't go but
this job of president may be lost.

808
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:40,169
I know its the brain
of Jose. Tell Jose.

809
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,201
Then I'm leaving, okay.

810
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,276
Mamachan, What kind
of a going is this?

811
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,280
Drink the coffee.

812
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:48,177
Nice coffee!

813
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:48,875
For that didn't drink, no?

814
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,844
Because of that only.

815
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:52,650
I've made one stronger
than this, to your wife.

816
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:53,583
Tell that.

817
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:01,354
Child get down.

818
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,689
Hi, my children!

819
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:07,458
Where is brother, mother?

820
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,697
He has gone for the matter
of your new house.

821
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,068
No, need of that
and all, now mother.

822
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:13,106
Our transfer is ready now.
- To where?

823
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:15,404
For me to Trivandrum and
for her to Muvattupuzha.

824
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:17,172
Very soon she will
get to Trivandrum.

825
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:19,077
One of my friend is in secretariat.

826
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:20,080
It was done through him only.

827
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:21,309
Then what about the kids?

828
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,274
That is a problem now.

829
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:24,512
Since its at two different places.

830
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:26,586
Will it be a problem to mother?

831
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,452
What is the problem to me?

832
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:29,718
Its only a problem of one month.

833
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,453
After that she'll come with
me till that time mother...

834
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,188
Even otherwise kids
love mother only.

835
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:36,458
Yes, yes that you came
to know that, now only is it?

836
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:37,589
We must leave today itself.

837
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,395
Shinny, make it fast.

838
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:44,570
President.

839
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:47,207
Local committee people
have started asking now.

840
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,106
What?

841
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:50,440
Not that after marriage it
has been 4 years now.

842
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:54,646
Still now why has a little comrade
not come? That's their question.

843
00:38:54,716 --> 00:38:56,548
What?
- The decision is all presidents only.

844
00:38:56,618 --> 00:38:58,484
Look, all this is at home only.

845
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,510
I'm her husband.

846
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,748
This is panchayat office.

847
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:02,489
Even otherwise there are
thousands of complaints about you.

848
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:03,217
What?

849
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:05,385
Seen at the panchayat office
in a suspicious manner.

850
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,188
So that is it.

851
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,592
All that time, Jose was
there wasn't it?

852
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:09,353
We've to talk.

853
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:10,527
Go on talk.

854
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,228
Hey man, you just go out.

855
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,469
Is it? Can tell to go
out from the room, no?

856
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:18,738
Not that, my heavens!

857
00:39:26,714 --> 00:39:27,408
Josetta!

858
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:29,608
Without shouting, listen to
what I say, first of all.

859
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:31,584
President, you don't say anything.
On asking whom?

860
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,553
Listen to what I'm saying.
- Yea, tell.

861
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,283
Morning Mamachan,
had come home.

862
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:36,551
When he came and
showed just smiling...

863
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:37,683
...forgot everything that was
done so far.

864
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:38,817
No, not because of that.

865
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:42,094
Our medical store's license
at Karthikapuram is in my name.

866
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,321
At the time of election we have
not mentioned that one.

867
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:45,366
How did he know this?

868
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,226
Told something like the
right of information and all.

869
00:39:48,503 --> 00:39:50,369
No doubt why village
is not developing.

870
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,638
Certain laws..

871
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:56,369
What is it?

872
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,113
You dirty fellow aren't you
ashamed to peep and look?

873
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:03,283
Asking whether I'm ashamed
to peep on to my wife?

874
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:04,443
I'll look again.

875
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:08,748
Anyway today I'll fix
a hidden camera.

876
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,150
Hey man, yesterday also saw.

877
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:14,227
May be a bad dream.

878
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:15,221
Her!

879
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:16,591
Which her?

880
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:18,199
That girl is there no?
That we saw at the church.

881
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:19,765
How come you haven't
left that so far?

882
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:21,894
Why can't we consider that?

883
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:22,830
You consider all by yourselves.

884
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,396
What is the use if I
consider all by myself?

885
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:26,199
Telling it must be
considered by family.

886
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:28,239
Then in that case it must
be considered thoroughly.

887
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:29,276
Don't con, okay.

888
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:31,275
That girl is not that much
aged and all Mamachan.

889
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:32,844
Will be jailed for abuse.

890
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,307
May be will be around 22 years.

891
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:36,575
Will be 22 years.

892
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:39,516
The way you say, will
feel like you are not yet 24!

893
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:40,315
My Mamacha...

894
00:40:40,388 --> 00:40:42,652
...why don't you look into
that case brought by Sally sister?

895
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,157
Look, had told that she is a singer.

896
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,192
At night can hear
the songs and sleep.

897
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:49,159
To hear the songs, I need
to buy a tape recorder, is it?

898
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,823
My heavens!

899
00:40:51,566 --> 00:40:52,658
What happened?
- Excellent!

900
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,768
Looks like uncle is dead. Come.

901
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:56,893
What happened mother?

902
00:40:57,472 --> 00:40:59,770
The leg has got a cut. Looks
like glass piece was struck.

903
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,739
Let me see.

904
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:02,401
Only this much!

905
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:04,468
This requires a stitch!
- There is nothing for that.

906
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:05,670
Just rub with some leaves.

907
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,476
In between this is there any
reason to call communist people?

908
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,709
This will get septic.

909
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,447
He is a person with sugar
and pressure and all, no?

910
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,153
What is the surety
it is struck by glass?

911
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:14,253
May be bitten by a snake, no?
- What, a snake?

912
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,681
On getting the name which was
bitten, can take out the poison.

913
00:41:15,757 --> 00:41:16,815
Can we get that one?
- Try calling.

914
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,693
My mother it is not, it is like that.

915
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,854
May be like that, even if or not,
there is a chance for that, no?

916
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:22,460
Last year, almost by the same time.

917
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,225
On the same leg, my uncle
was struck by glass...

918
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:25,197
...had dinner and slept.

919
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:26,427
Next day evening it was the burial.

920
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:28,665
In the last moment there
should be someone with father.

921
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:29,701
You get inside the vehicle.

922
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:32,162
Look, take this body.
- Then hold it.

923
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:33,736
Then no need, I myself will take it.

924
00:41:35,143 --> 00:41:36,440
Hold Mamachan.

925
00:41:36,511 --> 00:41:37,137
Mamacha!

926
00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:39,144
Do it by yourselves.

927
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,145
Don't put me down.

928
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:42,616
Mamacha, you don't come,
I'll manage this one.

929
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:44,685
Mamacahn, you go
and see whether the...

930
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,548
...bitten snake can be caught.

931
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:46,551
Go!

932
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,619
Which was the snake that you said?
- King cobra.

933
00:41:49,357 --> 00:41:52,156
Get in. Manju get in.
Mother get in at the back.

934
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:53,189
Child get in.

935
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:54,522
Careful!

936
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,689
No don't hang, if you hang and put
the poison will come up fast.

937
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,458
Slowly.

938
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,092
Why are you tieing? Is it
for the poison not to reach on top.

939
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,730
No that is for the police, not to catch
when seeing the cops, lift it up.

940
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:06,603
Look, haven't you not gone so far?

941
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:07,334
You come here.

942
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,736
First of all buy some medicine for
the cough, to that idiotic person.

943
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,640
Look, have you got some money?

944
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:12,441
Go man.

945
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,603
Inform who are to be informed.

946
00:42:14,482 --> 00:42:17,247
Move the hand mother. Child give
the hand here, must horn okay.

947
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:33,557
Stupid fellow!

948
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,203
What happened?

949
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:40,405
Uncles leg got cut.
Pachan, told its a snake bite.

950
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,636
Which is the snake?

951
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,199
Has declared an enquiry.

952
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:45,144
The Pachan expert
has told its a cobra.

953
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,681
I was in the kitchen other wise
I, would also have gone.

954
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,808
He didn't take me,
then will he take mother?

955
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:51,878
Take this...

956
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,247
...lucky he doesn't die on a jeep
accident, due to over excitement.

957
00:42:55,223 --> 00:42:56,247
Manju sit properly there.

958
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,751
My child don't cry.
- Go fast.

959
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,761
I'm going fast, no?
Okay press the horn.

960
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:13,196
Don't be scared like this.

961
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,802
Not regained the consciousness
so far. The BP is low.

962
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:21,375
Nothing to worry now
it is in the observation.

963
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:23,379
Anyway let him be here for few days.

964
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:25,180
Okay.
- Tomorrow we'll shift to the room.

965
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:28,551
Then its good that
you brought here on time.

966
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,194
Father, did they put the stitch?

967
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:39,529
No, if required they
told to take a TT.

968
00:43:41,169 --> 00:43:42,159
TT is good.

969
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,772
What Mamachan, told is true what
he wants is the medicine for cough.

970
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:51,707
Brother take this
and put it here okay.

971
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,179
Mamachan, do you know to play?

972
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,351
Did you hear, became check no?
That is it.

973
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:08,427
This guy!

974
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:10,529
Hey fellow.

975
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:13,830
Snake charmer has come, is it?

976
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:15,801
What happened to you on
that day, were you mad?

977
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:17,161
What all things were done by you?

978
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,433
Go Mamachan, simply"

979
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:20,698
Don't think I'm not
knowing anything.

980
00:44:21,142 --> 00:44:22,405
Mamachan what did you mean?

981
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:25,103
Come here. Do you know
that Manju is my sister?

982
00:44:26,147 --> 00:44:27,546
Do you know how
costly the rose flower is?

983
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,515
I know.

984
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,774
Then by plucking my flower
are you blooming your flower?

985
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:32,342
My dear Mamachan kindly pardon.

986
00:44:32,687 --> 00:44:35,520
Since you came to know the
things you must be with me.

987
00:44:36,724 --> 00:44:38,818
Will remain with you but not
because of the love towards you.

988
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:41,328
Then? - Thinking that uncle can
be given a task.

989
00:44:41,696 --> 00:44:43,790
Lot of my father's property
is with her father.

990
00:44:43,865 --> 00:44:46,163
Once you get inside that house then
the things will be doomed is it not?

991
00:44:46,234 --> 00:44:48,669
That I'll handle.
Mamachan just be with me.

992
00:44:49,837 --> 00:44:51,566
Then can I tell a thing which
is beneficial to you?

993
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:53,129
What is that?
Come will tell.

994
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:53,797
Come.

995
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,865
Why not tomorrow
we go to see a girl?

996
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:56,632
To see girl!

997
00:44:56,711 --> 00:44:59,703
From our area new people have
come here, on changing the stay.

998
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,272
One Kajirapalli person. The
person is a contemptible fellow!

999
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,341
But that person has got a
daughter she is a nurse at Delhi.

1000
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:06,477
I'm more interested on that
girl who was seen at the church.

1001
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:07,578
We can think about it.

1002
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:09,747
But before that, there is nothing
wrong in seeing, no?

1003
00:45:09,824 --> 00:45:11,758
No problem, but still more
interested on that girl only.

1004
00:45:11,826 --> 00:45:14,318
My Mamachan, I called
her father telling I'm a broker.

1005
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:17,632
He seems okay but I've not
told Mamachan's age and all.

1006
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:19,459
But anyway we'll go there tomorrow.

1007
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:21,734
But still saying, this nurse and all.

1008
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:24,662
Started. First go and see.

1009
00:45:25,172 --> 00:45:26,662
Then the rest of the things are
later, no? Even otherwise for...

1010
00:45:26,741 --> 00:45:28,539
...Mamachan's age nurse is the best.

1011
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:31,771
Again at this age what all diseases
like sugar, pressure are yet to come.

1012
00:45:32,246 --> 00:45:35,307
My Mamachan when marrying at an
old age, there must be some use.

1013
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:36,482
That is also true.

1014
00:45:37,418 --> 00:45:38,681
Is it a family that will suit me, man?

1015
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:40,221
Told no? Father is
a contemptible fellow.

1016
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:57,369
What is boy's job?

1017
00:45:57,571 --> 00:45:59,164
There is nothing as sort of a job.

1018
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:00,670
Some property is there
and also some politics.

1019
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:02,098
That is good.

1020
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:04,737
The things out here has
the broker told all that?

1021
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:05,577
No, that is...

1022
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:07,307
By the way, how come
he is not seen...?

1023
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:09,406
Wanted urgently to go to
a place, he has not come.

1024
00:46:11,786 --> 00:46:12,719
The girl is coming.

1025
00:47:02,103 --> 00:47:03,434
Where are you hailing from, the
native place that you said?

1026
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:06,273
The native place is...
One minute okay.

1027
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:08,175
Don't know who this one is?

1028
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,176
How is it?

1029
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:16,547
You are not Pachan,
you are a Saint.

1030
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,313
Why have you not told this before?

1031
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:21,816
This is all Pachan's play no?
When Mamachan sees in the mind.

1032
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,181
Pachan will see that on the tree.

1033
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,153
What more yet to see?

1034
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:26,550
Coming, coming.

1035
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:29,660
Had not drank tea, yet?
- Yea.

1036
00:47:31,132 --> 00:47:33,658
We are the natives of Kanjirapalli.
- Where at Kanjirapalli?

1037
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,429
Over there its called 26.

1038
00:47:35,503 --> 00:47:37,471
Is it?
We are also from 26.

1039
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:40,704
Over there this Pakilomattom
Cheriyan sir, everyone knows him.

1040
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:41,740
That is my father.

1041
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:44,539
Are you Mamachan, no?

1042
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,239
Yes, how do you know?

1043
00:47:46,313 --> 00:47:48,304
At 26 one who was staying
in your enclosure.

1044
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:50,612
Do you remember that Kunnel,
Avaras's son Vareeth?

1045
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:51,446
Why not?

1046
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:53,112
I've whacked him long back, no?

1047
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,412
Where is he now?

1048
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:55,455
Let it remain there.

1049
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,815
During those times do
you remember one Mollykutty...

1050
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,149
...who used to come along
with you, to school?

1051
00:47:59,226 --> 00:47:59,784
Why not?

1052
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,192
As Mollykutty told only,
I had whacked him.

1053
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:04,323
Those were the times.

1054
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,398
That loafer is staying there only.

1055
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:11,403
Don't look, come, come.

1056
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:19,511
Call his father!

1057
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,672
Is that needed?

1058
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,280
Then at least call him a dog!

1059
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,447
Go you dog!

1060
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:26,515
What dog? You stay there girl.

1061
00:48:26,754 --> 00:48:27,482
Mamacha!

1062
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,180
Haven't I told, no?

1063
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:32,150
Mamacha, no need leave.

1064
00:48:32,226 --> 00:48:33,523
You'll hold her hand is it?

1065
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,563
What is it? Is it tooth ache?

1066
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:43,236
Tooth ache?

1067
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:45,705
At that time I was very
fond of Mollykutty.

1068
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:47,306
Don't know where she is now?

1069
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:49,136
On coming to Malabar,
no news at all.

1070
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,177
Is here only!

1071
00:48:50,311 --> 00:48:51,142
She is my wife only.

1072
00:48:51,212 --> 00:48:52,145
Is that so?

1073
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,559
Then this Vareeth?
- I'm the one!

1074
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,057
Excellent. Come.

1075
00:49:08,129 --> 00:49:08,789
Sit there man.

1076
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:11,326
Something to girl...

1077
00:49:11,398 --> 00:49:12,126
What is it fellow?

1078
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,795
There is no use of that.

1079
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:17,103
Anyway liked the girl. Anyway no
need of much going and coming.

1080
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:18,635
Father you decide a date.

1081
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:19,502
Father!

1082
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:22,276
The girl who is going to be married
her father is called like this, no?

1083
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,807
So are you the one who is marrying?

1084
00:49:26,814 --> 00:49:27,610
Get up, fellow!

1085
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:31,544
Aren't you ashamed? Marrying
a girl who is daughters age.

1086
00:49:32,086 --> 00:49:33,110
Have come with a marriage
proposal only, no?

1087
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,378
Get out from the house!

1088
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:36,321
On thinking the future of the child.
Get out I say.

1089
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:39,516
Do I've to tell you
separately, get out fellow?

1090
00:49:39,693 --> 00:49:40,524
Get out!
- Ho! No!

1091
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:41,584
Think once again or
else will have to repent.

1092
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:42,595
Go I say.
- No, need.

1093
00:49:42,663 --> 00:49:44,097
Did you take only the 'Jilebi'?
You fool.

1094
00:49:44,165 --> 00:49:44,688
He threw out that 'achappam', no.

1095
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:46,392
What are you looking?
Go inside.

1096
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,131
Mother is not bad, no?

1097
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:48,794
Go, girl.

1098
00:49:49,103 --> 00:49:51,197
'Waiting shed, Jaya Bharatha
Kala Kendram - Santhipuram'.

1099
00:49:59,113 --> 00:50:01,844
In this old age, certain peoples wish.

1100
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:05,783
That is not the thing, when the
men get mad, will they do like this?

1101
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:08,818
I'll show this fellow today.
- My heavens!

1102
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:09,713
Mamacha!

1103
00:50:11,692 --> 00:50:13,854
He is mad, for not
getting the girl. Come.

1104
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:18,264
Lucky that you called me, other
wise would have vexed myself.

1105
00:50:24,872 --> 00:50:26,601
There is no point in blaming them.

1106
00:50:26,674 --> 00:50:28,369
Anyone will laugh on this.

1107
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,638
Yesterday on reaching home do you
know how many times I, laughed...

1108
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:31,837
...thinking on this.

1109
00:50:32,146 --> 00:50:34,774
On telling this matter to mother,
mother keeps on laughing...

1110
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:36,476
...still now not stopped laughing.

1111
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,814
After father's death, I'm seeing
mother laughing like this...

1112
00:50:38,886 --> 00:50:40,445
...for the first time.

1113
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:43,584
Did you get tensed?
- Then what?

1114
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,321
Leave it Mamachan. If she can't
be wedded, will wed her mother.

1115
00:50:46,393 --> 00:50:48,191
You only wed her mother.
- What me?

1116
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:50,762
What is the way to see her?

1117
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,164
That way is there on that day
when we went to see the girl.

1118
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,199
Only that way is there.

1119
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:55,235
Will give one.

1120
00:50:55,336 --> 00:50:56,826
Hey fellow just to talk.

1121
00:50:56,904 --> 00:50:59,305
For that there is a way.
- Is it the way which was told before?

1122
00:50:59,773 --> 00:51:01,366
She goes to church every day.

1123
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:02,841
On going to church can see her.

1124
00:51:03,844 --> 00:51:06,438
Going to church is
a trouble some work.

1125
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:09,407
But on thinking she can be seen...

1126
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:20,590
“The keeper of light
Lend us the permission“

1127
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:25,599
“To light the lamp at the altar“

1128
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:31,299
“Let us open singing
doors of wishes“

1129
00:51:31,372 --> 00:51:36,538
“To know the kingdom of wishes“

1130
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:41,878
“Give us the permission Lord“

1131
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:54,720
“The prince of kindness..
The prince of kindness“

1132
00:52:10,778 --> 00:52:11,643
Gone!

1133
00:52:13,614 --> 00:52:15,446
Doing rubbish inside the
church compound fellow.

1134
00:52:15,516 --> 00:52:16,449
Why, can't a phone call be made?

1135
00:52:16,517 --> 00:52:17,348
Get out fellow.

1136
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:18,579
Told no? I'm going.

1137
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:24,554
“Aren't you girl, with a smiling eyes?
Aren't you a pearl, with beauty?“

1138
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:29,290
“Kindly write the love,
divine creation“

1139
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,622
“During the festival at church
On a silver chariot“

1140
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:40,266
The happiness flutters and spills out
In the sea..I'm a like a breeze“

1141
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:48,478
Check!
My God!

1142
00:52:56,623 --> 00:53:01,527
“Like an un faded flower
Within the nest inside the heart“

1143
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:07,625
“With take care of you, lovingly. Will
remain lingering in pain, by one self“

1144
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:13,105
“On the Athen valleys
Slowly adds color to it“

1145
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:18,339
“Kindly leave. By giving
kiss of sweet words“

1146
00:53:18,512 --> 00:53:22,449
“She is my beauty of heaven“

1147
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:28,618
“Aren't you girl, with a smiling eyes?
Aren't you a pearl, with beauty?“

1148
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:34,150
“Kindly write the love,
divine creation“

1149
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,404
Hey stop there, man.
- Run!

1150
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:54,842
“An unending river
Which is full of song of soul“

1151
00:53:55,149 --> 00:54:00,815
“The waves danced on kindness
On telling your name“

1152
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:06,491
"In the broth of love
On the un seen shores"

1153
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:11,555
“Give a handful of shyness“

1154
00:54:11,765 --> 00:54:16,100
“The moon has bloomed
from head to toe“

1155
00:54:16,703 --> 00:54:22,164
“Aren't you girl, with a smiling eyes?
Aren't you a pearl, with beauty?“

1156
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:26,770
“Kindly write the love,
divine creation“

1157
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:30,145
“During the festival at church
On a silver chariot“

1158
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:37,750
“The happiness flutters and spills out“
In the sea..I'm a like a breeze“

1159
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,788
Mamachan also started
to travel at the back.

1160
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,161
Even though got old he also
has got wishes and emotions.

1161
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:46,631
After all he is a human being, no?

1162
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:01,076
Get down.
Careful, okay.

1163
00:55:03,317 --> 00:55:05,786
Brother, you have got
high contacts in Delhi, is it?

1164
00:55:06,086 --> 00:55:06,746
Why not?

1165
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:09,718
I wanted to ask one thing.
- What is there in that?

1166
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:11,224
Then, I'm getting down okay.

1167
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,521
Mamacha, money?
- No need you keep it.

1168
00:55:16,497 --> 00:55:17,623
Don't worry you may ask.

1169
00:55:17,698 --> 00:55:19,462
Asking the doubt to the right person!

1170
00:55:19,867 --> 00:55:21,858
Not that what is brothers intention?

1171
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:24,365
No, there is no special
intention like that.

1172
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:27,533
If there is intention or not? Kindly
don't pester by walking behind me.

1173
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:28,666
Won't pester you.

1174
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:31,335
Just thought of seeing
and talking to you.

1175
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,776
Moreover if there is any
misunderstanding...

1176
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:34,211
...we'll sit there and talk.

1177
00:55:34,281 --> 00:55:37,114
To sit and talk its not a
politics, is it? - No.

1178
00:55:37,351 --> 00:55:39,115
Father, has told on that day
itself, not interested, is it?

1179
00:55:39,186 --> 00:55:39,516
Yes.

1180
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,714
This much age difference,
will anyone allow?

1181
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:42,584
No!

1182
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:46,354
Even if I say I like, do you
think father will allow?

1183
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:46,825
Don't know.

1184
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:50,119
Because of that to make people
talk, by walking behind me, again...

1185
00:55:50,197 --> 00:55:51,187
...don't pester me.

1186
00:55:51,298 --> 00:55:51,821
No.

1187
00:55:52,232 --> 00:55:53,791
Sorry to say only.
- Hey you!

1188
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,796
Hey you, dirty fellow
leave my daughter.

1189
00:55:56,236 --> 00:55:57,499
Stop there, fellow.
- My heavens!

1190
00:55:58,205 --> 00:56:00,401
What man? What do you
want? Is it my child?

1191
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:04,074
Flirting with some stupid fellows.
Go home, girl!

1192
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,247
On that day you were not beaten
and send out from the house.

1193
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:08,405
That is because of my decency.

1194
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:11,241
What is the quality
that you posses, man?

1195
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:14,179
By holding up the loin cloth
and wandering to and fro is it?

1196
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,553
One politician has come, hey you!

1197
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:19,590
First of all try to become at
least a ward member...

1198
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,253
...and then think of marrying.

1199
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:24,391
Has come with a party which
is not heard in the area.

1200
00:56:24,498 --> 00:56:26,865
If you are seen in front
of my daughter, again.

1201
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,159
You'll know the real character
of Vareeth, okay.

1202
00:56:29,236 --> 00:56:31,398
Didn't you see he caught
on my daughter's hand?

1203
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,098
He and his politics.

1204
00:56:33,273 --> 00:56:35,173
I won't leave him.
- The shirt got wrinkled.

1205
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,202
Can't you go and die, man?

1206
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:53,249
Why are you late?
- The vehicle came late.

1207
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:57,598
Then..Met that old
friend of mother also.

1208
00:56:58,365 --> 00:57:01,062
There is no sign of he leaving.
Did he say anything, to you?

1209
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,661
For few days he is walking
in front and behind me, is it?

1210
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,740
On seeing there was no way
out, I told him to stop that.

1211
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:11,406
What did he say?
- He is not the one, what we thought?

1212
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:15,381
A poor guy, only after saying
thought it was not required.

1213
00:57:16,216 --> 00:57:20,084
Did you say any non sense?
- How? Will I say like that?

1214
00:57:20,253 --> 00:57:24,190
After all, its mother's friend, no?
- Okay, you go inside.

1215
00:57:26,393 --> 00:57:28,521
In between that, father came in.

1216
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:31,127
Scolded a lot on that poor guy.

1217
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,429
Not that, I'm thinking
why not I marry him?

1218
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,500
Mother what do you say?
- Look, don't con, go inside.

1219
00:57:39,306 --> 00:57:40,831
Mollykutty was struck!

1220
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,834
It has been 14 days as on
today since you talked to me.

1221
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:46,609
Again if you show humbug
I also know to show.

1222
00:57:47,147 --> 00:57:49,844
On that day, why did you pretend on
saying father was bitten by snake?

1223
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,515
So, your worry is that father
was not bitten by snake is it so?

1224
00:57:52,586 --> 00:57:53,212
Look.

1225
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:56,252
The way you look, will feel
like I did it intentionally.

1226
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,426
Did it, thinking that there should be
some respect in front of your father.

1227
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,458
Did I know it'll turn out like this?
Not that...

1228
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,662
...how is mother?

1229
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:05,791
Look, don't make me talk, okay.

1230
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,665
What is up?

1231
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:14,734
Will say after drinking.

1232
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:17,533
You go to that Esho-appan, and see
whether military can be obtained.

1233
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:19,612
Okay then.

1234
00:58:22,382 --> 00:58:26,080
Look, tell Vakkappan that I'm coming.

1235
00:58:26,153 --> 00:58:27,382
Again when father sees
you, he'll kill you.

1236
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:29,182
Then what?
Killing!

1237
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:30,788
He doesn't have the guts for all that.

1238
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:39,093
(A p raye r)

1239
00:58:49,242 --> 00:58:50,368
Look straight and pray.

1240
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,609
Children you pray
father will come now okay.

1241
00:59:00,687 --> 00:59:01,654
Lord, let there be 'MH'.

1242
00:59:01,722 --> 00:59:04,054
<i>'MH' must be there.
Here comes the 'MW.</i>

1243
00:59:04,191 --> 00:59:06,353
'Kind Maria, salutations to you'

1244
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:10,360
'Along with the Lord,
you are also blessed'

1245
00:59:10,564 --> 00:59:12,464
'As per your advice, the Christ'

1246
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,134
'Becomes the one who is blessed'

1247
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:16,803
'Kind Lord, the sinners like us'

1248
00:59:17,104 --> 00:59:17,570
Here.

1249
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,196
'Always, at the time of our death'

1250
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,574
The item costing
Rs.150, costing Rs 400.

1251
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,575
'...one which spoils
the individuals and families...'

1252
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,077
'...the temptations on liquor...'

1253
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:27,203
Morning at the church he will
be the first person to yell out.

1254
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,145
God, kindly protect.

1255
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:32,085
Otherwise no need, on first again
have to come to the same place.

1256
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,184
Lord, forget it.

1257
00:59:33,754 --> 00:59:43,095
(Playing a love song
in the back ground)

1258
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:45,325
Stop it man.
- One was put according to situation.

1259
00:59:45,398 --> 00:59:46,297
Okay if you don't want, no need.

1260
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:48,460
Totally became ashamed.

1261
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:51,703
He verbally insulted me to the core.
That too, in front of her.

1262
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:53,436
I know Mamachan, got upset.

1263
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,142
You leave that. That is because
you are loving for the first time.

1264
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,336
Next time there won't
be any problems.

1265
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,711
For the first time?
Me?

1266
01:00:01,148 --> 01:00:03,810
Hey Pacha, I have started
this before you were born.

1267
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:07,514
Including your sister Jancy.
I've loved 6 people.

1268
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,179
Since you are her brother
that is why I'm taking you...

1269
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:10,746
...all though you are an idiot!

1270
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:11,848
Mamacha!

1271
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:14,257
None among them did
not mind me, that is true.

1272
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:14,759
Natural!

1273
01:00:14,828 --> 01:00:16,853
After that no other girl
has entered into my mind.

1274
01:00:17,164 --> 01:00:19,189
God, has shown her to me.

1275
01:00:19,466 --> 01:00:22,436
Otherwise what is the use
of father pushing me to church?

1276
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:24,533
Because of that,
I thought it'll take place.

1277
01:00:24,604 --> 01:00:26,163
It will happen Mamachan.

1278
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,401
The marriage will
take place in heaven...

1279
01:00:28,475 --> 01:00:29,465
...that is what is
said in our Bible, no?

1280
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:31,201
Go man!

1281
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,408
Man, which is this vehicle?
- This one...?

1282
01:00:35,448 --> 01:00:37,507
This is 'Duster' a very good mileage.

1283
01:00:37,584 --> 01:00:40,281
Not that, whose vehicle is this?

1284
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,685
Didn't you recognize him?

1285
01:00:41,755 --> 01:00:44,690
Our Mathanchettan who died,
it is his prodigal son.

1286
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:46,351
Long time back one who
eloped and went, Charley.

1287
01:00:46,426 --> 01:00:48,326
He has gone to Bombay and
made lot of money and came back.

1288
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,159
Now after buying that 'Pettu
Simons' house and enclosure...

1289
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,629
...he is staying there only.

1290
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:53,890
Do you know who are
the Charley's new friends?

1291
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:56,192
That Jose, uncle and that Kochappi.

1292
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,232
He should be like that only.

1293
01:01:03,677 --> 01:01:05,236
14 years.

1294
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:09,513
By dreaming this day
only I slept on all other days.

1295
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:13,279
On coming back, thought
everyone will be here.

1296
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:14,286
But...

1297
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,189
It's there Charley.
- We all are there.

1298
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:21,157
Jose is it possible that you go head
with this panchayat and all always?

1299
01:01:21,394 --> 01:01:23,863
Trying. Its politics, no?

1300
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:25,296
Will see.

1301
01:01:25,565 --> 01:01:27,693
Not that, here Mamachan
has to be suppressed is it not?

1302
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,496
That is not as big
as to suppress and all.

1303
01:01:29,569 --> 01:01:33,199
Simply its a kind of show off.

1304
01:01:35,408 --> 01:01:36,898
Then pour one more.

1305
01:01:37,177 --> 01:01:39,339
No, no need. Stop!

1306
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:41,471
That is not possible.

1307
01:01:41,648 --> 01:01:43,514
With consciousness for the
head and strength for the limbs.

1308
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:44,880
No one should leave from here.

1309
01:01:45,252 --> 01:01:46,413
While drinking should
drink to the point...

1310
01:01:46,486 --> 01:01:47,317
...where the
consciousness is lost.

1311
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:49,151
Otherwise don't try this task.

1312
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:50,647
Bring it here.

1313
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:52,289
Charley!

1314
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,287
Is it okay to carry on like this?

1315
01:01:54,527 --> 01:01:56,859
After marrying need
one family and all, no?

1316
01:01:57,163 --> 01:02:00,531
To be honest, on this return
there is also an intention like that.

1317
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,194
After finding a good
girl and should marry her.

1318
01:02:03,336 --> 01:02:05,805
On the flee to make
money forgot to live.

1319
01:02:06,206 --> 01:02:07,696
That matter we'll take care of it.
- Yes.

1320
01:02:07,774 --> 01:02:10,505
Our post man George's younger
daughter is there, no?

1321
01:02:10,577 --> 01:02:12,102
Why can't we propose her?

1322
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,671
She is the one who eloped with
the boy at the St. George bus.

1323
01:02:14,748 --> 01:02:17,183
She came back on
the next day itself, no?

1324
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,718
I saw her brooming
the courtyard in the morning.

1325
01:02:18,785 --> 01:02:19,775
Then there won't be any problems.

1326
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,643
No, no all that won't suit at all.

1327
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:23,854
Our Vareeth's daughter is there no?

1328
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,420
Why not that girl, be proposed?

1329
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,550
That may not be okay.

1330
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:27,559
What is wrong in that?

1331
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:30,129
What is there he has got with him?

1332
01:02:30,363 --> 01:02:32,297
That is not there.
- That you leave it.

1333
01:02:32,465 --> 01:02:33,296
How is the girl?

1334
01:02:33,366 --> 01:02:34,458
A beautiful one.

1335
01:02:35,135 --> 01:02:36,625
But nothing is there.

1336
01:02:37,203 --> 01:02:38,898
A good girl.
- That is what I also want.

1337
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,139
You just think over it.

1338
01:02:40,206 --> 01:02:41,435
The girl is 10 sovereign gold.

1339
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,873
For that have you
rubbed and checked?

1340
01:02:43,143 --> 01:02:46,670
The own one still now not rubbed
and checked that is still pledged.

1341
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:49,238
What is it?

1342
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,744
The only negative point is,
Mamachan has seen the girl.

1343
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:55,517
On that day itself the girl's
parents has told no, to it.

1344
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,487
But still Mamachan is after her only.

1345
01:02:57,557 --> 01:03:00,583
Even if its broth of milk, if
the dog licks its gone, no?

1346
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,719
You just try, the Mamachan's
case I'll handle.

1347
01:03:03,096 --> 01:03:05,326
Then come.
- Where are you going, sit?

1348
01:03:05,398 --> 01:03:07,093
Let us go and talk
this over and come.

1349
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:10,728
That can be discussed tomorrow.
- All this can't be left for tomorrow.

1350
01:03:11,137 --> 01:03:11,695
You go.

1351
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,833
Aren't you coming?
- You go and arrange it.

1352
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:16,472
I'll fix this one!

1353
01:03:20,113 --> 01:03:20,807
Will it take place?

1354
01:03:22,115 --> 01:03:22,741
Not yet finished man?

1355
01:03:22,816 --> 01:03:24,215
Mamachan, will be over now.

1356
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:28,278
Brother you cut slowly. On
going there is no other job, is it?

1357
01:03:28,822 --> 01:03:29,721
Go man.

1358
01:03:37,263 --> 01:03:38,162
Mamacho!

1359
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:40,800
What is the news?
Has been long since seen.

1360
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:43,693
How are the things in Delhi?
ls everyone keeping fine?

1361
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:44,635
Why not?

1362
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:48,708
Since your party men are not doing
good in Delhi, there all are fine.

1363
01:03:50,543 --> 01:03:52,637
Hey man, you come here.
- What is it man?

1364
01:03:53,613 --> 01:03:55,240
Why are you not happy?

1365
01:03:55,315 --> 01:03:57,215
To be happy, your father
has not died, no?

1366
01:03:58,284 --> 01:04:00,753
Shall I tell one thing which
makes you really happy?

1367
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:02,518
One girl is there which
you wanted to marry.

1368
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,284
Which one? Our Vareeth's.

1369
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:07,825
Her marriage, we all
have jointly fixed.

1370
01:04:12,532 --> 01:04:15,365
Till so far, to all the tasks which
you have given to me...

1371
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:17,369
...just take it as a return to that.

1372
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,235
I can only do it this much.

1373
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:23,240
Then one who is going to marry
her is not an old man like you.

1374
01:04:23,309 --> 01:04:24,708
He is a youth!

1375
01:04:25,712 --> 01:04:27,578
Charley, can you come till here?

1376
01:04:43,496 --> 01:04:44,554
Look at the way he comes.

1377
01:04:57,777 --> 01:04:59,370
This is the thing which I had told.

1378
01:04:59,446 --> 01:05:01,414
Mamachan, a big guy!

1379
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,280
One who has invented Delhi.
In the history of Indian politics.

1380
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,682
A chapter that cannot be omitted,
that is what is standing here.

1381
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:12,554
Mamachan must help me.

1382
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:15,588
When my father died it was only..

1383
01:05:15,628 --> 01:05:17,460
...Mamachan who wanted
to inform me.

1384
01:05:17,597 --> 01:05:19,361
Have searched a lot, haven't you?

1385
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,567
Mamachan, as you know
I don't have anyone in here.

1386
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:24,794
Because of that.

1387
01:05:25,105 --> 01:05:26,595
In the position of my father...

1388
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,767
...Mamachan should conduct
this marriage for me.

1389
01:05:30,643 --> 01:05:33,305
Now, you are little happy is it not?

1390
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:37,148
Will see.

1391
01:05:58,404 --> 01:05:59,803
Now what to do man?

1392
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,699
There is no time to think, if anything
is to be done, it must be done now.

1393
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:06,476
That is what I'm also thinking.

1394
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,516
Now the tent has to be erected,
should call the people.

1395
01:06:09,582 --> 01:06:11,550
Charley, has delegated
everything to Mamachan only.

1396
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:12,717
Those people who are
to be personally called...

1397
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:14,184
...Mamachan, they must
be called like that.

1398
01:06:14,254 --> 01:06:16,086
For some people when invited
over the phone they won't like it.

1399
01:06:16,156 --> 01:06:17,487
Go man!
- Mother!

1400
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:19,418
Your father should be called.

1401
01:06:21,261 --> 01:06:23,457
Why don't we go up to Delhi?
- Is it to wed your father?

1402
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:25,396
Not because I wish to go to Delhi.

1403
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:26,489
She went back.

1404
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:27,590
Didn't you know?

1405
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:30,260
Can you give that soap?

1406
01:06:31,437 --> 01:06:32,563
Rub With this.

1407
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:33,435
Slippers?

1408
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:38,100
Look, on going there no need
to worry on Charley or her father.

1409
01:06:38,611 --> 01:06:40,739
Can tell the matter
and can be cleared.

1410
01:06:42,148 --> 01:06:43,673
I think it can be done.

1411
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:46,779
Must call Saly.

1412
01:06:57,564 --> 01:06:58,463
Brother.

1413
01:06:59,532 --> 01:07:02,229
By compelling and calling
brother didn't even talk.

1414
01:07:02,635 --> 01:07:03,659
Has the child slept lady?

1415
01:07:06,172 --> 01:07:08,766
If I tell a thing
will you come to tear?

1416
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:10,073
You tell.

1417
01:07:11,177 --> 01:07:14,704
Last week it was our 'Thekele
Jimmychans' marriage fixation.

1418
01:07:15,215 --> 01:07:16,683
As they had given
the ad on internet.

1419
01:07:16,749 --> 01:07:19,275
Do you know within 2 weeks
how many proposals had come?

1420
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,348
Why don't we also
give one ad like that?

1421
01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:23,780
What is his age now?

1422
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:25,355
26.

1423
01:07:27,193 --> 01:07:28,422
Don't you have any
work at the kitchen?

1424
01:07:28,761 --> 01:07:29,819
All that I'll do it.

1425
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:31,621
Answer me to what I asked brother.

1426
01:07:32,098 --> 01:07:34,430
Hey lady, my age is not 26.

1427
01:07:35,368 --> 01:07:37,427
You go and press two
of my shirt and 'mundu'.

1428
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:40,131
Tomorrow very urgently
have to go to somewhere.

1429
01:07:40,206 --> 01:07:42,868
To press the shirts and 'mundu'
bring one girl and tell her that one.

1430
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,133
No doubt why he was
made to be here by getting old.

1431
01:07:45,211 --> 01:07:46,372
From top angel will come.

1432
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,375
Angel and all won't be okay.

1433
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:51,481
Again, will it come?

1434
01:08:01,127 --> 01:08:04,062
It was you. I thought it was
your cut out placed.

1435
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:05,495
Why in this dress?
- Don't we have to go?

1436
01:08:05,565 --> 01:08:06,225
To where?

1437
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,232
To Delhi.
- For that who has called you.

1438
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,460
For a help to Mamachan.

1439
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,159
Otherwise on seeing her
Mamachan will be nervous.

1440
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,068
Won't be nervous.
- Will be nervous.

1441
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:14,104
Won't be nervous.

1442
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,299
My dear Mamachan,
don't say like that.

1443
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,069
Tell like that.

1444
01:08:16,276 --> 01:08:18,244
Had told good bye to mother
in the morning and had come.

1445
01:08:18,278 --> 01:08:19,268
On going back immediately mother...

1446
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,642
...will think Delhi is some
where a nearby place here.

1447
01:08:20,713 --> 01:08:21,805
But I've got only one ticket.

1448
01:08:22,081 --> 01:08:24,243
Mamachan you don't worry on that,
I'll hang somewhere and stay.

1449
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:27,686
It is leather.
- Not leather. Its 'Khadar'

1450
01:08:27,754 --> 01:08:29,415
Whatever it is for the Mamachan's
get up all this is okay, no?

1451
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:30,781
Put the cloth pleats down.

1452
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,157
Release the breath.

1453
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:33,448
Remove that glass.

1454
01:08:34,127 --> 01:08:34,787
Now hold this.

1455
01:08:35,161 --> 01:08:36,287
Now I became the old, me, no?

1456
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,091
As per your height,
only this is enough.

1457
01:08:38,164 --> 01:08:39,689
Come. Take that bag.

1458
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:44,365
The first sight is any way good.

1459
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,663
Here comes your old lover.

1460
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:48,335
Should have married her at
least by killing that Vareeth.

1461
01:08:48,508 --> 01:08:49,498
Keep quiet man.

1462
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:51,668
Seriously preparing
for a journey, no?

1463
01:08:51,844 --> 01:08:53,676
We are to Delhi.
- Up to here only.

1464
01:08:54,147 --> 01:08:54,670
Up to here only.

1465
01:08:54,814 --> 01:08:55,474
Why this way?

1466
01:08:55,748 --> 01:08:58,149
Since coming after all these
days, has not seen mother so far.

1467
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:59,750
Must come out in the time
when he is not there, is it not?

1468
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:01,150
Yes, yes.

1469
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:02,247
Molly.

1470
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,122
On that day, I...

1471
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:06,556
...coming to see the
girl, that incident...

1472
01:09:06,626 --> 01:09:07,752
...don't tell mother.

1473
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:08,787
No, I won't.

1474
01:09:09,629 --> 01:09:11,563
Mamachan, knows his
character, is it not?

1475
01:09:12,098 --> 01:09:13,691
Don't feel bad on saying
like that on that day.

1476
01:09:15,535 --> 01:09:17,594
L..Simply fought is it not?

1477
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,102
Okay, I'm going.

1478
01:09:23,609 --> 01:09:25,543
What is that you were telling
about fighting and all?

1479
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,704
Your sister Jancy!

1480
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:27,669
No, no need.

1481
01:09:34,687 --> 01:09:35,813
Has reached.

1482
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,480
One minute.

1483
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,253
We are coming straight to there.

1484
01:09:40,493 --> 01:09:42,461
Brother 2 Sasthamangalam.
- This is not a bus, but an auto.

1485
01:09:42,628 --> 01:09:45,393
On the way can you
show that capital?

1486
01:09:45,565 --> 01:09:47,624
That place I'll show you
on reaching inside the room.

1487
01:09:55,508 --> 01:09:57,237
This is Chandrasekharan
Nair stadium.

1488
01:09:58,511 --> 01:10:00,775
It was that one, no?
- Have you seen it before?

1489
01:10:03,182 --> 01:10:04,274
Hi, zoo!

1490
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:05,818
Sit properly man.

1491
01:10:07,553 --> 01:10:09,487
Why don't we go after 3 or 4 days?

1492
01:10:09,655 --> 01:10:11,817
You stay.
I have some work, ongoing.

1493
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:22,566
What is this grave yard or what?
- Keep quite.

1494
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,659
There is life.

1495
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:27,829
How much is it?

1496
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:28,664
20.

1497
01:10:29,675 --> 01:10:30,369
Take the balance.

1498
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:32,138
What is there as balance?
This only 20, no?

1499
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:34,373
This might be placed
due to my arrival, no?

1500
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:36,279
What is the use of all
this between us, Mamachan?

1501
01:10:36,349 --> 01:10:37,248
You come here.

1502
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,215
Followers.
- Greetings.

1503
01:10:38,284 --> 01:10:39,547
Is Gopi there?
- He is inside.

1504
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:40,513
Take the rest.

1505
01:10:40,586 --> 01:10:42,782
Didn't you hear what the
leader has said? Take the rest.

1506
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,690
Don't know which idiot is this?

1507
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,194
It was Mamachan, no?

1508
01:10:58,438 --> 01:10:59,667
Now you are reading English and all.

1509
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:01,104
That is not for reading.

1510
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,733
While sleeping to protect
from light falling on the face.

1511
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:04,800
As it is English,
it will be really hard.

1512
01:11:05,378 --> 01:11:06,106
Who is this?

1513
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,738
This is our boy in the youth.

1514
01:11:07,814 --> 01:11:11,182
Understood, the district president.
Tony Vakkathanam.

1515
01:11:12,285 --> 01:11:13,411
Shall I order something cold?

1516
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,185
Hey fellows, if anybody is
there without sleeping go...

1517
01:11:15,254 --> 01:11:16,779
...and bring 3 soda lime.

1518
01:11:17,123 --> 01:11:19,353
But still my Mamacha,
when that Swamy told...

1519
01:11:19,425 --> 01:11:20,688
...to sit simply as president.

1520
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,694
I never expected this much!
There is no job at all.

1521
01:11:22,795 --> 01:11:24,194
All that will be corrected.

1522
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,388
Somehow lets us get into
anyone of the frontiers.

1523
01:11:26,732 --> 01:11:28,166
Automatically the job will come.

1524
01:11:28,468 --> 01:11:31,130
You wait and see in the tomorrows
discussion something will happen.

1525
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,763
Well, very good if
something takes place.

1526
01:11:32,839 --> 01:11:35,308
Then tomorrow I won't be
there, you go all alone.

1527
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,307
How can that be possible?

1528
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,605
I'm trying to make the things
right through an another means.

1529
01:11:38,678 --> 01:11:42,205
Through our 'Poonjattu'
person a try to get into 'UPF'

1530
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:44,409
For us there is no rule
that only left is suited.

1531
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:45,578
Then.

1532
01:11:46,185 --> 01:11:47,880
That you at the 'Udayagiri
panchayat' has arranged a rain...

1533
01:11:48,154 --> 01:11:50,350
...water harvest program,
what is the value of that?

1534
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,318
Mmm..Out, out!

1535
01:11:56,762 --> 01:11:58,696
So, no one has come to know is it?

1536
01:11:58,764 --> 01:12:00,289
Ho! Its not at all a big deal at all.

1537
01:12:00,366 --> 01:12:01,424
But still how much will
be the value of it?

1538
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:03,629
Somewhat like 65 lakhs!

1539
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:05,466
Have you started digging the hole?

1540
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:07,131
Without the rain where to dig?

1541
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,308
Then in that case you start
a project to start the rain.

1542
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:10,474
That is good.

1543
01:12:10,543 --> 01:12:11,476
Will see to it.

1544
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:13,512
Then while sharing
don't forget me okay.

1545
01:12:13,646 --> 01:12:14,670
Okay, I'm leaving.

1546
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:17,842
Earlier also its like this, on taking
about money your ears won't work.

1547
01:12:18,117 --> 01:12:19,346
Blanket, blanket!

1548
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,679
Hello, Swamy!

1549
01:12:23,122 --> 01:12:26,217
Swamy give me some work, by
sitting idle here, root goes down.

1550
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:27,724
I was not late, no?

1551
01:12:28,494 --> 01:12:30,326
You were talking something
about rain harvest.

1552
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,758
That is because of rain there is
holes every where only told that.

1553
01:12:32,832 --> 01:12:35,130
That is not the matter. it is
concerned with getting money.

1554
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:36,259
That is why told me
to stand outside, no?

1555
01:12:36,335 --> 01:12:38,599
Understood that much, is it?
That is more than enough.

1556
01:12:38,804 --> 01:12:40,738
Hello Tony Vakkathanam.

1557
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:44,835
Should not simply walk like this,
our youth wing should be...

1558
01:12:45,211 --> 01:12:48,146
Our youth wing should
be made strong. Okay go, go.

1559
01:12:50,883 --> 01:12:55,286
Mamacha, on one thing
I'm thankful to you.

1560
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,286
After failing in 7th standard
for the first time...

1561
01:12:57,356 --> 01:12:58,687
...one person is calling
my real name. - Is it?

1562
01:12:58,758 --> 01:13:01,159
Actually I didn't remember
I had a name like this.

1563
01:13:01,227 --> 01:13:03,161
But anyway really happy.
Okay, then hold this.

1564
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:05,361
Come.
- Then what about lime juice?

1565
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:06,462
Its simply a promise.

1566
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:09,661
Won't get that. Understood
that one also, no? Please come.

1567
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,202
Pacha, put the phone
down the comrade has come.

1568
01:13:19,245 --> 01:13:20,144
Greetings.

1569
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,741
Have you reached long time back?
- I came by 11 o'clock itself.

1570
01:13:24,183 --> 01:13:24,479
Come.

1571
01:13:25,718 --> 01:13:28,449
I thought of reaching
by 11 o'clock but...

1572
01:13:28,754 --> 01:13:30,586
...in between, that Pillai
came and made a cross.

1573
01:13:30,723 --> 01:13:32,885
Pillai, says there should be no
new candidates taken inside the front.

1574
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,184
To join with him there
are lot of tiny leaders.

1575
01:13:35,261 --> 01:13:37,593
At last on telling all will be
thrown out, all kept quite.

1576
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,292
Its very difficult this
system of united front.

1577
01:13:40,366 --> 01:13:41,800
Lot of parties without
any sort of ideas.

1578
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:43,335
And lot of leaders for it.

1579
01:13:43,402 --> 01:13:45,427
Not that, comrade what
about my matter?

1580
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,597
The moment when I took your...

1581
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,868
...matter for discussion,
then all started.

1582
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:51,140
VKP was the one who
was dead against.

1583
01:13:51,243 --> 01:13:53,507
You know all those
things, no? Come.

1584
01:13:55,481 --> 01:13:58,849
Anyway the things
ended in a good manner.

1585
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,548
In the next front meeting
you'll be there.

1586
01:14:03,556 --> 01:14:06,753
I know for your party
only there are leaders.

1587
01:14:07,226 --> 01:14:09,661
All this is on account
of relationship with you.

1588
01:14:10,096 --> 01:14:12,121
At that time when Veeran
left our front and went.

1589
01:14:12,298 --> 01:14:14,357
The 'Thadi Thomas and
Theyya' was plucked from...

1590
01:14:14,433 --> 01:14:16,834
...there and they were brought
here. It was done by you only.

1591
01:14:17,136 --> 01:14:19,127
During that time if you
had not played like that.

1592
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,299
Everyone would have
fallen by hitting the nose.

1593
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,365
Hey man can all that be forgotten?
- Yes.

1594
01:14:23,442 --> 01:14:26,309
Then what about the matter of seat?
- There is a chance for one.

1595
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:28,138
Sometimes it won't be there also.

1596
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,749
For the seat which all filthy persons
will do what all things, who knows.

1597
01:14:32,184 --> 01:14:35,677
As the election is declared now all
the toy snakes will raise the heads.

1598
01:14:36,188 --> 01:14:38,156
You'll be here in the
evening, no? Will meet.

1599
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:42,693
Not that must go to Delhi.
- Convey my regards to Sharmaji.

1600
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:45,695
The matter of the seat
will be decided within...

1601
01:14:45,765 --> 01:14:47,597
...a weeks time, I'll call.

1602
01:14:48,434 --> 01:14:49,492
Red salute comrade.

1603
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:51,133
Truly!

1604
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,276
The Delhi is completely changed.

1605
01:15:07,787 --> 01:15:09,186
For that have you seen Delhi?

1606
01:15:09,655 --> 01:15:11,680
How?
- In the movie New Delhi!

1607
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:14,320
Do you want to see
the capital once more? - No!

1608
01:15:14,393 --> 01:15:16,191
I don't want to see that place.

1609
01:15:19,165 --> 01:15:22,396
While going to Sharmaji should
sit respectfully and with modesty.

1610
01:15:22,568 --> 01:15:23,399
Did you understand?

1611
01:15:24,704 --> 01:15:26,763
Why can't these people
chop all this and plant rubber?

1612
01:15:27,139 --> 01:15:28,732
Here the rubber won't grow.
That is why.

1613
01:15:28,808 --> 01:15:32,608
Look there.
- This is that China gate, no?

1614
01:15:32,845 --> 01:15:33,710
India gate.

1615
01:15:34,747 --> 01:15:36,215
Only gate is there, why
there is no compound wall?

1616
01:15:36,582 --> 01:15:37,572
Will you please keep quite.

1617
01:15:40,252 --> 01:15:41,720
By the way there is
no compound wall, no?

1618
01:15:42,154 --> 01:15:42,677
Did you see it?

1619
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:45,182
Look!

1620
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:46,386
Nothing.

1621
01:15:59,271 --> 01:16:00,136
Greetings Swamy.

1622
01:16:00,506 --> 01:16:02,099
Was the journey fine?
- Was fine.

1623
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,333
This is Swamy, he is the
personal secretary of Sharmaji.

1624
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:05,241
Greetings.

1625
01:16:05,444 --> 01:16:06,809
If we start now we
can meet Sharmaji.

1626
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:10,174
Will be fresh now and come.
- Carry on. - Come.

1627
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,380
Greetings Sharmaji!

1628
01:16:15,454 --> 01:16:16,683
Hey Mamchand!

1629
01:16:17,356 --> 01:16:18,414
Come man, come.

1630
01:16:18,758 --> 01:16:20,749
Bless me.
- I was waiting for you.

1631
01:16:21,594 --> 01:16:22,686
How are you man?

1632
01:16:23,129 --> 01:16:23,595
I'm fine.

1633
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:25,163
Who is this?

1634
01:16:25,231 --> 01:16:27,427
He is our state president,
Tony Vakkathanam.

1635
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:28,862
Oh! Good state president?

1636
01:16:29,135 --> 01:16:30,534
Fall on the feet!

1637
01:16:30,603 --> 01:16:32,128
Okay, okay.

1638
01:16:33,139 --> 01:16:34,197
Okay, sit, sit.

1639
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,736
Sharmaji, I...
- Okay, okay.

1640
01:16:40,279 --> 01:16:40,677
Then...?

1641
01:16:41,313 --> 01:16:44,681
In the Kerala assembly also we are
going to have our representation.

1642
01:16:45,417 --> 01:16:47,647
Well very good Mamchand.
- Thank you.

1643
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,822
Comrade Murliji
has done everything.

1644
01:16:50,222 --> 01:16:52,589
Good.
- Has conveyed regards to Sharmaji.

1645
01:16:52,658 --> 01:16:55,684
Really great, look Mamchand.

1646
01:16:56,228 --> 01:16:59,220
With me I've got lot
planning for the parliament.

1647
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:03,298
But now the issue is, I've got an
appointment with Home minister.

1648
01:17:03,769 --> 01:17:07,103
You do one thing meet me in the
evening at that time, I'll tell details.

1649
01:17:07,406 --> 01:17:09,738
Will meet in the evening, no?
- Okay. - Take care.

1650
01:17:14,446 --> 01:17:15,311
Didn't see.

1651
01:17:16,115 --> 01:17:18,311
Just like a Hindi film got over.

1652
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:19,749
Then what you told was
all true, is it?

1653
01:17:19,819 --> 01:17:21,378
What?
- You are really great, okay.

1654
01:17:21,453 --> 01:17:23,751
The idiotic compatriots are they
knowing any of these things?

1655
01:17:23,823 --> 01:17:25,723
Not that Mamachan,
at the Trivandrum you told.

1656
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:29,227
I'm the district president while
coming here, told I'm state president.

1657
01:17:29,295 --> 01:17:30,421
Then when you go
to America tomorrow will...

1658
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:31,429
...you make me Indian president?

1659
01:17:31,497 --> 01:17:34,364
That is the value of 'khadar' the
positions will keep on gaining.

1660
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,666
There is no use at all.
Come.

1661
01:17:47,179 --> 01:17:48,340
Are you scared?

1662
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:49,480
For what?

1663
01:17:50,216 --> 01:17:53,151
Just asked felt like, there
is some sort of tension.

1664
01:17:54,486 --> 01:17:55,817
Then why are you drumming
with your hands?

1665
01:17:56,288 --> 01:17:57,483
The hand is shivering that is why.

1666
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:02,253
Don't know what to do?
- Don't do anything.

1667
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:06,092
Will you keep quite?
- Okay then I'm not talking.

1668
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,568
Hey man when she comes
I'll show some hum-bug.

1669
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:10,568
You should start talking.

1670
01:18:10,636 --> 01:18:11,432
Come here.

1671
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,368
First you'll say don't talk, now
you are telling to talk.

1672
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:14,702
Now should I talk or not?

1673
01:18:15,174 --> 01:18:17,404
First of all tensed again
are you putting more tension?

1674
01:18:19,211 --> 01:18:20,542
I'll talk, okay.

1675
01:18:21,146 --> 01:18:22,113
Here she comes.

1676
01:18:22,581 --> 01:18:23,742
What to do now?
- Why not we run?

1677
01:18:23,816 --> 01:18:25,079
Be still man.

1678
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,125
When did you reach?
- Yesterday.

1679
01:18:36,262 --> 01:18:36,785
Today.

1680
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,560
Sit.
- Its okay.

1681
01:18:39,765 --> 01:18:42,530
This is Stella.
- Mamachan. - Liza has told.

1682
01:18:42,768 --> 01:18:44,327
Pachan.
- Didn't ask!

1683
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:46,335
Sit.

1684
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,503
Sit, sit.

1685
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:51,140
Why no one is talking anything?

1686
01:18:51,343 --> 01:18:53,141
That is because, you talk.

1687
01:18:53,212 --> 01:18:54,509
What is the rate of one operation?

1688
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,275
Operation to whom?

1689
01:18:56,348 --> 01:18:57,315
To some one!

1690
01:18:57,383 --> 01:19:00,614
No, for anyone...if they wants.

1691
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:03,618
Is there doctor here?
- Yes, there is.

1692
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:04,589
What about the attender?

1693
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:06,384
A very good hospital, a
hospital should be like this.

1694
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:08,153
Then Mamachan, why don't we go?

1695
01:19:10,596 --> 01:19:11,620
Don't sweat while standing.

1696
01:19:11,697 --> 01:19:13,392
We'll move away. Come Pacha!

1697
01:19:13,465 --> 01:19:15,263
We'll go.
- Girl you may go.

1698
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:18,065
There no problem with
Mamachan if I stay here.

1699
01:19:18,137 --> 01:19:19,696
Go man, you stupid fellow!

1700
01:19:19,772 --> 01:19:21,331
Became a nuisance, is it?

1701
01:19:21,407 --> 01:19:22,465
Come here, you Pachan.

1702
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:23,599
Coming Stella.

1703
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:24,575
Sit.
- Sit.

1704
01:19:29,281 --> 01:19:31,750
What is this?
With the black badge and all.

1705
01:19:32,117 --> 01:19:35,815
That one, no? One of our
nurse who was with us, died.

1706
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:39,088
Everything was ready
for her to go abroad.

1707
01:19:39,325 --> 01:19:41,794
But the management didn't allow.

1708
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:44,126
For that, that girl...

1709
01:19:44,496 --> 01:19:45,292
My heavens!

1710
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:48,231
Wanting an enquiry on that
demanding bond must be stopped...

1711
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,631
...its a strike against it.

1712
01:19:49,668 --> 01:19:50,601
That is good.

1713
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:53,662
For the first time a person from
the native place to see me, in here.

1714
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,341
Well, I didn't come to see like that.

1715
01:19:56,408 --> 01:19:59,400
Then when Pachan told
you'll be here, thought of seeing.

1716
01:19:59,611 --> 01:20:01,170
That is understood.

1717
01:20:06,185 --> 01:20:07,277
What? Is it coffee?

1718
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,517
Brother, won't have come.

1719
01:20:10,356 --> 01:20:12,791
The marriage should be
with consent of parents.

1720
01:20:12,858 --> 01:20:14,257
I've only that condition.

1721
01:20:15,127 --> 01:20:17,289
Without their permission,
I'll not do anything.

1722
01:20:18,263 --> 01:20:20,891
What you told is true.
Just wanted to see.

1723
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:23,658
That's all. Then just wanted
to say something...

1724
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,569
I know brother loves me.

1725
01:20:27,506 --> 01:20:28,701
Then mother also has told.

1726
01:20:28,841 --> 01:20:31,776
You are a poor guy.
All that is not my worry.

1727
01:20:32,444 --> 01:20:36,711
Father won't allow.
Has struggled a lot for me.

1728
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:41,152
Poor person. In father's
dreams only I'm there.

1729
01:20:41,553 --> 01:20:43,885
Not that, the over aged
is a problem for me.

1730
01:20:45,357 --> 01:20:46,722
Brother do you know?

1731
01:20:46,892 --> 01:20:50,260
At the Kajirapalli one of
my marriage was canceled.

1732
01:20:51,296 --> 01:20:54,197
That is why father sold
the property and came there.

1733
01:20:55,834 --> 01:20:58,303
Just consider my
proposal has not come.

1734
01:21:00,873 --> 01:21:02,807
If you need any help just call me.

1735
01:21:03,742 --> 01:21:04,368
Here.

1736
01:21:05,344 --> 01:21:07,142
Then I'll take leave.

1737
01:21:12,384 --> 01:21:13,715
The nose of Stella is what I liked.

1738
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:14,878
Then what about Manju's nose?

1739
01:21:15,154 --> 01:21:16,212
Tell Manju to go.

1740
01:21:19,525 --> 01:21:21,584
We'll go, no?
- We are going.

1741
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,554
Then will meet in the next visit.

1742
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:26,394
There is no next visit.
- Shall I go Stella?

1743
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:29,833
Go fellow!

1744
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:39,542
Mother!

1745
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:43,740
Both of you are here.

1746
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,139
Hold this.

1747
01:21:48,787 --> 01:21:50,619
Why have you come
here, without informing?

1748
01:21:52,191 --> 01:21:54,455
What is it?
What happened?

1749
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,158
Where is brother?
- He has gone to Delhi.

1750
01:21:57,729 --> 01:22:00,221
Where are the kids?
- They have slept.

1751
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,092
When is brother coming back?

1752
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,295
Will come back
after 3 or 4 days only.

1753
01:22:04,636 --> 01:22:06,263
What is it? Tell what the matter is?

1754
01:22:06,405 --> 01:22:07,600
Mother don't you know anything?

1755
01:22:07,706 --> 01:22:09,435
You tell what the matter is, clearly.

1756
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,806
Do you know who has transferred
me and her to 2 different places?

1757
01:22:12,478 --> 01:22:13,843
Mother's dear son, Mamachan.

1758
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,379
No, no he won't do
anything like that.

1759
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:18,177
Don't make me to talk more.

1760
01:22:18,317 --> 01:22:19,182
Come lady.

1761
01:22:24,223 --> 01:22:26,123
What a pity is this?

1762
01:22:30,262 --> 01:22:31,661
When is your next return?

1763
01:22:31,797 --> 01:22:34,425
Before the marriage, I'll reach
here 10 days before.

1764
01:22:37,836 --> 01:22:41,363
Hello, tell where are you?
Are you at the hostel?

1765
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,704
We must rock the marriage.

1766
01:22:43,775 --> 01:22:45,539
Then I'll kill you.

1767
01:22:46,145 --> 01:22:49,171
I intended this marriage
should be blasting.

1768
01:22:50,315 --> 01:22:52,841
That is utter cheating, hey
man to the alcohol drank...

1769
01:22:53,185 --> 01:22:54,311
...must show thankfulness at least.

1770
01:22:54,353 --> 01:22:56,515
Hey man what I told is
this must be conducted...

1771
01:22:56,588 --> 01:22:58,579
...in a good way by celebrating.

1772
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:03,658
Tell like that. After drinking don't
talk to me like un educated people.

1773
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:07,431
Will you people keep quite?
What happened?

1774
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:09,465
Searching her that filthy
guy has went there, today.

1775
01:23:09,535 --> 01:23:10,832
Who?
- Is it that Mamachan?

1776
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:13,432
He has become a big
nuisance, now what to do?

1777
01:23:13,605 --> 01:23:14,595
Will see.

1778
01:23:14,773 --> 01:23:18,266
Charley, you go boldly.
We will deal with him.

1779
01:23:18,343 --> 01:23:21,313
After chopping him to pieces
only after that we will meet again.

1780
01:23:21,446 --> 01:23:22,311
Who will chop?

1781
01:23:23,148 --> 01:23:24,707
Okay, if you need
anything, just call me.

1782
01:23:24,783 --> 01:23:25,773
Key!

1783
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:41,256
On thinking what have you
told you'll handle Mamachan?

1784
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,628
By drinking his alcohol...

1785
01:23:42,701 --> 01:23:45,500
...must say something to please
him, what do you say Jose?

1786
01:23:46,138 --> 01:23:50,268
Have you got shame? For a
long time both are babbling.

1787
01:23:56,882 --> 01:23:57,576
Mother!

1788
01:23:59,718 --> 01:24:00,412
Mother!

1789
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:06,284
Why is mother
looking at me like this?

1790
01:24:06,592 --> 01:24:07,718
Thomachan had come.

1791
01:24:08,427 --> 01:24:09,417
How is he doing?

1792
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:12,491
Told, how he got
the transfer and all.

1793
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:17,095
But still this much was not required.

1794
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:20,172
My dear mother he only told
he wants to live separately.

1795
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,203
Then to go immediately,
I saw only this way.

1796
01:24:23,275 --> 01:24:26,267
Then why didn't you
transfer both to one place?

1797
01:24:26,545 --> 01:24:27,569
Then things will be different...

1798
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,705
...he would have taken
the kids and gone.

1799
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:32,650
Mother only told no? Can't
stay without seeing the kids.

1800
01:24:32,718 --> 01:24:35,585
In this case it will serve
both the purposes.

1801
01:24:36,188 --> 01:24:37,485
Mother go and take one tea.

1802
01:24:37,589 --> 01:24:40,354
'The decision was not taken
today, the bars will remain closed'

1803
01:24:40,425 --> 01:24:42,723
'There are chances of a big re
shuffling in the central ministry'

1804
01:24:42,794 --> 01:24:43,761
<i>'Kenna, with great expectation'</i>

1805
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:47,356
'This time it is noticed that Kerala
will have a major role in the ministry'

1806
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:56,808
Go girl!

1807
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:00,735
She can't be blamed, also!

1808
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:12,821
Mamachan, come.

1809
01:25:13,592 --> 01:25:15,526
We reached 10 minutes back.
Knew that.

1810
01:25:15,594 --> 01:25:17,255
How come a sudden visit?

1811
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,664
The election is the topic.

1812
01:25:20,465 --> 01:25:22,399
Do you know how many
seats we may get?

1813
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:23,730
There is only a chance for one.

1814
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:26,764
Is there any idea who
the candidate is?

1815
01:25:26,838 --> 01:25:27,634
That will be me only.

1816
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,435
In the coming day,
district committee is called.

1817
01:25:30,609 --> 01:25:33,579
In Kerala as the new
situations has emerged.

1818
01:25:33,645 --> 01:25:36,342
Sharmaji, has got some other plans.

1819
01:25:37,182 --> 01:25:41,551
In the next term ministry expansion
there will be a minister from Kerala.

1820
01:25:44,156 --> 01:25:46,420
The plan is to bring it
to Rajyasabha from youth.

1821
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:48,388
Either Mamachan or Gopi.

1822
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,322
That is what Sharmaji, has told.

1823
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,424
You both are alike to party, no?

1824
01:26:00,172 --> 01:26:01,333
Now I'll tell my suggestion.

1825
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:02,134
Tell.

1826
01:26:02,207 --> 01:26:05,233
Mamachan at Delhi and Gopi
staying here that will be good.

1827
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:07,404
What do you say Mamachan?
- Okay then.

1828
01:26:08,113 --> 01:26:09,672
We can ask Trivandrum
south, no Gopi?

1829
01:26:09,815 --> 01:26:11,078
Okay ask.

1830
01:26:11,149 --> 01:26:13,117
In that case let Gopi go for
the fronts meeting in the evening.

1831
01:26:13,185 --> 01:26:14,584
Try hard for the south.

1832
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:17,522
Now there is no
difference opinion, is it?

1833
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,249
No.

1834
01:26:19,124 --> 01:26:20,285
Then everything as told.

1835
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:23,720
Mamachan see you at Delhi again.

1836
01:26:36,341 --> 01:26:38,776
Comrade, what kind of
an action is that? - What?

1837
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:40,209
While asking Trivandrum
south, gave 'lrikkoor'.

1838
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:41,143
Who asked?

1839
01:26:41,346 --> 01:26:43,644
Yesterday Gopi was only crying
and demanding wants lrikkoor.

1840
01:26:43,682 --> 01:26:44,308
GOpi?

1841
01:26:44,383 --> 01:26:45,145
That is because as that...

1842
01:26:45,217 --> 01:26:46,776
...constituency chances
of wining is more.

1843
01:26:46,852 --> 01:26:50,413
You don't worry man. All though
its a sitting seat of KP.

1844
01:26:50,722 --> 01:26:52,713
On trying hard that can be gained.
- Yes.

1845
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,691
It has been more than 30 years, no?

1846
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,125
The people might
have got enough of it.

1847
01:26:56,194 --> 01:26:57,457
Why not? Might had enough.

1848
01:26:58,163 --> 01:27:00,655
Any other constituency.
- I've told what I can.

1849
01:27:01,066 --> 01:27:05,060
The rest you people do.
10 to 15 parties and one seat.

1850
01:27:06,438 --> 01:27:08,463
I'll...
- Might have had enough.

1851
01:27:10,776 --> 01:27:11,538
Comrade.

1852
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:17,111
Friends, after the formation
of DNC Kerala unit.

1853
01:27:17,249 --> 01:27:19,547
For the first time we
have obtained a seat.

1854
01:27:20,252 --> 01:27:23,813
Because of that this election as far
as we are concerned, its very vital.

1855
01:27:24,089 --> 01:27:27,115
We've received 'lrikkoor' where
the chances of winning is more.

1856
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:31,622
There, we must find a strong
candidate that is my opinion.

1857
01:27:31,797 --> 01:27:34,459
Instead of lrikkoor, I'm trying
for some other constituency.

1858
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:35,796
Yes, yes.
- What for?

1859
01:27:36,301 --> 01:27:38,565
At lrikkoor our wining is sure,
then why thinking...

1860
01:27:38,637 --> 01:27:42,130
...of other constituency? That is
purely foolishness that is my opinion.

1861
01:27:42,207 --> 01:27:43,868
That is true.
- What I mean to say is...

1862
01:27:44,142 --> 01:27:45,166
There is no issue.

1863
01:27:45,243 --> 01:27:48,178
Our party is contesting
in the lrikkoor constituency.

1864
01:27:48,246 --> 01:27:48,804
That is true.

1865
01:27:49,114 --> 01:27:51,640
In that case, in this situation
I'm recommending Gopi as a candidate.

1866
01:27:51,716 --> 01:27:52,683
That is true.

1867
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:54,719
How can that be?
- That is okay.

1868
01:27:54,786 --> 01:27:56,550
I'm a person who is outside
that constituency.

1869
01:27:56,621 --> 01:27:58,180
Its better that one person who
is from that constituency...

1870
01:27:58,256 --> 01:27:59,314
...should be the candidate.
- That is also correct.

1871
01:27:59,391 --> 01:28:00,654
You tell one among them is correct.
- That is also correct.

1872
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:01,590
So that is the correct side of that.

1873
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:02,821
So because of that in
the lrikkoor constituency.

1874
01:28:03,094 --> 01:28:04,562
As a candidate and
people's choice...

1875
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:07,758
As one who is dear to all
I declare Mamachan.

1876
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:09,464
That is correct.
- All of you clap.

1877
01:28:09,668 --> 01:28:11,568
The meeting is dispersed.
'That is correct', you go home.

1878
01:28:11,636 --> 01:28:13,070
All of you go.

1879
01:28:16,441 --> 01:28:17,203
Phone.

1880
01:28:18,076 --> 01:28:19,134
Wait there, wait.
- I'm also coming.

1881
01:28:19,277 --> 01:28:20,369
What have you done?
- What is it?

1882
01:28:20,412 --> 01:28:22,403
You should have stood, no?
That is what we have decided is it?

1883
01:28:22,481 --> 01:28:24,779
All that doesn't matter is it about
thinking on things in Delhi?

1884
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,218
You don't worry and that I'll handle.

1885
01:28:27,252 --> 01:28:29,152
You are wanted by the
people of lrikkoor.

1886
01:28:29,454 --> 01:28:32,480
I don't think there is any need for it.
Its only when I win, no?

1887
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,190
Mamachan, I'll make you win.

1888
01:28:39,664 --> 01:28:41,428
Kerala, is the hot bed of elections.

1889
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,235
Both the parties
have declared the first list.

1890
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:47,337
In the lrikkoor, for the left
un expected candidate.

1891
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:50,397
DNC national secretary,
Mr. CP Mamachan...

1892
01:28:50,475 --> 01:28:52,204
At lrikkoor, is the leftist candidate.

1893
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:57,147
At Trivandrum the DNC state
secretary Mr. Gopi has...

1894
01:28:57,315 --> 01:29:00,182
...declared Mamachan
as their candidate.

1895
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,310
Our Mamachan?

1896
01:29:01,386 --> 01:29:03,650
So its true that he is
national secretary is it not?

1897
01:29:04,122 --> 01:29:06,318
Irikkoor is the only seat of DNC.

1898
01:29:06,525 --> 01:29:08,254
This Mamachan is
a real big thing okay.

1899
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,055
When saying a MLA and
all, then what is he?

1900
01:29:10,195 --> 01:29:13,221
Who?
- That after wining in election.

1901
01:29:13,298 --> 01:29:16,097
That thing is received, like this there
will be red light on top of the vehicle.

1902
01:29:16,134 --> 01:29:17,465
For that doesn't he have to win?
- Must win.

1903
01:29:17,536 --> 01:29:22,133
Jose, now you are the same front.
From tomorrow onwards...

1904
01:29:22,207 --> 01:29:24,073
...must ask vote for Mamachan.
- Who?

1905
01:29:24,242 --> 01:29:25,073
Me?
- Yes.

1906
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:26,711
My dog will go.
- Okay with that one also.

1907
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:30,112
On this election our party
won't be having any work.

1908
01:29:30,181 --> 01:29:32,275
Then his party is it
not contesting this time?

1909
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:33,579
That is not the thing.
- Then.

1910
01:29:33,652 --> 01:29:36,451
As per Mamachan's character, not a
single vote will be received at least...

1911
01:29:36,521 --> 01:29:37,613
...from his house.

1912
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:47,394
Okay comrade. Is it from
tomorrow onwards?

1913
01:29:47,732 --> 01:29:49,291
I'll be there.

1914
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:51,600
Who is it Jose?

1915
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:54,537
From the district committee.
- Lucky she is not the one.

1916
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,664
From tomorrow onwards must
start the election work.

1917
01:29:57,108 --> 01:29:58,735
This is something like being
caught inside the rat trap.

1918
01:29:58,810 --> 01:29:59,675
When?

1919
01:30:00,779 --> 01:30:03,271
Can't take it out and must
walk with the rat trap.

1920
01:30:03,348 --> 01:30:04,372
There is no other go,
than carrying it.

1921
01:30:04,449 --> 01:30:05,382
What is the use of
getting angry on me?

1922
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:07,748
Better than this was
suspension or degrading.

1923
01:30:11,356 --> 01:30:13,415
No, not reached.
- We are in the same area.

1924
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:14,820
How to go without seeing?

1925
01:30:16,728 --> 01:30:19,220
Lord, anything for the mother?

1926
01:30:19,798 --> 01:30:21,789
What happened?
- Nothing has happened.

1927
01:30:22,267 --> 01:30:24,861
To meet the MLA candidate
everyone has come.

1928
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:25,796
This is the person.

1929
01:30:27,606 --> 01:30:29,370
Mother, brother has come.

1930
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:32,609
How is the set up?

1931
01:30:36,481 --> 01:30:37,505
Brother.
- When did you come?

1932
01:30:37,582 --> 01:30:39,141
We came on hearing the news.

1933
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:40,481
Brother, tea.

1934
01:30:40,585 --> 01:30:41,245
Tea!

1935
01:30:43,154 --> 01:30:44,246
How is it? Are you happy?

1936
01:30:44,656 --> 01:30:45,350
Come here.

1937
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:49,818
Who told you to bring them all to
the house? Must send all of them.

1938
01:30:49,894 --> 01:30:53,262
I just for a show off, to make a
pomp. Did it become an issue?

1939
01:30:53,331 --> 01:30:54,730
People are mad out here.

1940
01:30:56,468 --> 01:30:57,196
What is it?

1941
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:03,434
Mamacha, my dear
son hats off to you!

1942
01:31:04,242 --> 01:31:06,176
Come will serve you coffee.

1943
01:31:06,244 --> 01:31:08,178
See, see.
- I'll show you now.

1944
01:31:10,148 --> 01:31:12,116
Hey man, on wining here the
things in Delhi will go out of hand.

1945
01:31:12,183 --> 01:31:13,378
That stupid Gopi is
waiting for a chance.

1946
01:31:13,451 --> 01:31:15,476
Which means?
- We must fail.

1947
01:31:15,854 --> 01:31:17,219
Then don't you want
to become MLA?

1948
01:31:17,255 --> 01:31:19,553
MLA? ls MLA out here or
MP in Delhi which is big?

1949
01:31:19,624 --> 01:31:20,455
MP at Delhi.

1950
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:23,254
So, Mamachan must fail.

1951
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:26,158
That is easy no? Will anyone
vote for you, who knows you.

1952
01:31:27,599 --> 01:31:29,465
Should have thought of it before.
- What is it?

1953
01:31:30,135 --> 01:31:32,229
When checked before. The bad
mark which was created here...

1954
01:31:32,303 --> 01:31:32,895
...it could be spread to
whole of this constituency.

1955
01:31:33,171 --> 01:31:34,138
Give you one beat.

1956
01:31:34,339 --> 01:31:37,309
Will eat the food prepared by mother
and we'll think of some ideas, come.

1957
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:42,344
Will the item come?

1958
01:31:43,281 --> 01:31:46,216
This is not the item which comes
like that, I've tried my maximum.

1959
01:31:46,651 --> 01:31:49,450
Before coming, will become in mood.
You pour one more.

1960
01:31:56,828 --> 01:31:58,557
Looks like its him. Move all this fast.

1961
01:32:03,668 --> 01:32:05,261
Jose, come.

1962
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:06,570
Come inside.

1963
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:10,237
Sit Jose.

1964
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,176
Sit Jose.

1965
01:32:15,146 --> 01:32:16,671
What do you want to drink?
- Nothing is required.

1966
01:32:17,482 --> 01:32:20,144
Then, why I called Jose is...

1967
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:21,716
...that is to tell about
the matter of Mamachan.

1968
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:22,814
That I felt so.

1969
01:32:23,855 --> 01:32:25,653
Jose should really work hard.

1970
01:32:26,391 --> 01:32:27,620
That is to make him win no?

1971
01:32:27,692 --> 01:32:28,659
My dog will work.

1972
01:32:31,429 --> 01:32:32,828
What if Jose is also benefited?

1973
01:32:33,264 --> 01:32:35,358
Even if you say will
give rupees one crore...

1974
01:32:35,433 --> 01:32:37,424
...I'll not get a single vote for him.

1975
01:32:37,569 --> 01:32:39,264
One crore is not there.

1976
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:41,299
But few lakhs are there.

1977
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:42,763
Here.

1978
01:32:46,377 --> 01:32:48,778
Take it.
- Tempting people, is it not?

1979
01:32:49,214 --> 01:32:51,808
What should I do? That is told by
Gopi. There are no cameras here.

1980
01:32:52,884 --> 01:32:56,582
From your panchayat not even
a single vote should go out.

1981
01:32:56,755 --> 01:32:58,689
Then to the maximum put
the people and all over...

1982
01:32:58,723 --> 01:33:00,487
...the constituency do the campaign.
That's all.

1983
01:33:00,558 --> 01:33:02,185
If it were that not even a
single vote should be gained.

1984
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:03,694
That will happen, we don't
have to do anything...

1985
01:33:03,762 --> 01:33:05,594
...just fold our hands
and watch and see.

1986
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:08,155
This is like, bit tough.

1987
01:33:08,233 --> 01:33:11,203
My Jose I know that that is why
I, delegated this to Jose, only.

1988
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:12,700
If Jose intends, it will take place.

1989
01:33:14,606 --> 01:33:17,132
There is no surety and all.
Will see to it.

1990
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:18,536
My dear Jose.

1991
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:22,110
If Mamachan fails here
then we can't hold him then.

1992
01:33:22,413 --> 01:33:25,644
In the central ministry there will be
a nomination from Kerala, of DNC.

1993
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,375
While failing he will get the chance.

1994
01:33:27,585 --> 01:33:30,577
Because of that at any cost
he'll try to fail in here.

1995
01:33:31,122 --> 01:33:33,318
But to make him win, that
is my necessity, now.

1996
01:33:35,226 --> 01:33:37,251
In the middle of this
is there a game like that?

1997
01:33:37,796 --> 01:33:40,356
Then you must say
that no? This I'll manage.

1998
01:33:40,465 --> 01:33:42,194
I only wanted to hear that.

1999
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,335
Then shall I go and start the work?
- Okay then.

2000
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:46,436
Every minute is precious.
- Yes, yes.

2001
01:33:46,504 --> 01:33:47,767
Money..Take care of it.

2002
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:50,834
Don't know whether there
is camera kept anywhere.

2003
01:33:51,576 --> 01:33:52,168
In

2004
01:33:52,243 --> 01:33:53,608
Just pour one.
- Its ready.

2005
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,312
Jose whatever you
say, this we won't allow.

2006
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,240
You listen to what I'm saying.

2007
01:34:00,318 --> 01:34:02,412
Now what you told is okay.
Again don't tell this one.

2008
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:06,181
Not that, what happened
to you Jose? - My dear uncle...

2009
01:34:06,257 --> 01:34:08,123
Might have received
money from Mamachan. - That is it.

2010
01:34:08,193 --> 01:34:10,423
Is your wife working for Mamachan?

2011
01:34:10,495 --> 01:34:13,624
Why is that?
Otherwise Jose will not say like this.

2012
01:34:14,132 --> 01:34:17,295
Look my wife is panchayat
president, not panchayat pipe.

2013
01:34:17,368 --> 01:34:19,598
When any problem comes, to come
running over to there with the pot.

2014
01:34:19,671 --> 01:34:21,662
All that is not the
problem out here, no?

2015
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:23,673
How did Jose get turned?

2016
01:34:24,309 --> 01:34:26,835
Anyway I've decided
to work for Mamachan.

2017
01:34:27,278 --> 01:34:29,770
Those who wants to go can go.
- Jose, is that so?

2018
01:34:29,848 --> 01:34:32,476
We've got only one word. We are
not there for this dirty work.

2019
01:34:32,517 --> 01:34:34,212
- That is it. - You come.
- Lets go.

2020
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:40,119
Mamachan is a Malayalee, more
that that he is our compatriot also.

2021
01:34:40,225 --> 01:34:43,126
Then for Mamachan,
other than us who will work.

2022
01:34:43,194 --> 01:34:46,186
Jose will not do anything like that
without seeing anything, I'm sure.

2023
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:48,629
Then Jose what is our
future program?

2024
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,190
We are breaking!
- Who?

2025
01:34:50,668 --> 01:34:52,864
The bottle we are breaking.
- Then what about Mamachan?

2026
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:54,898
We'll win Mamachan.

2027
01:34:55,173 --> 01:34:56,299
Then start the actions.

2028
01:34:56,374 --> 01:34:57,705
Started.
- Pour fast.

2029
01:35:01,379 --> 01:35:02,175
Look, silver owl.

2030
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,581
Okay man, bus will come now.
You may go now.

2031
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,780
Mamacho!
- Who is that?

2032
01:35:10,421 --> 01:35:12,116
What Lalettan?

2033
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,718
No, its Josettan.
- Oh! It was you?

2034
01:35:16,227 --> 01:35:19,197
Where is Mamachan on a journey?
- Just for an 'agitation on salt'.

2035
01:35:19,264 --> 01:35:19,856
Why? Are you joining?

2036
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,099
What man morning itself
you are in a debating mood?

2037
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:22,496
What is it, if so?

2038
01:35:22,567 --> 01:35:25,229
From now on we should jointly work.
- Is it so?

2039
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:28,103
Mamachan you don't worry.
- We are all there with you.

2040
01:35:28,339 --> 01:35:30,671
We will make you win.
- Indeed!

2041
01:35:30,842 --> 01:35:32,537
What if, I don't want your help?

2042
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:35,739
This is your problem.
Your character is like kids.

2043
01:35:36,347 --> 01:35:41,615
Inside its neat. You be prepared
to win. We've started our work!

2044
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,687
Mamachoo!
- Mamacha!

2045
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:51,488
Where to?
- Somewhere!

2046
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:54,223
Ho! Jose!
- What man?

2047
01:35:54,299 --> 01:35:55,698
Nothing.
- Nothing? Then get in.

2048
01:35:55,767 --> 01:35:57,326
Will go.
- Get in man.

2049
01:35:57,402 --> 01:35:57,834
Got in.

2050
01:35:58,136 --> 01:36:02,733
“After Maveli..Only you are
there. If you convince all men“

2051

“When vote and seat is more. Ones
own matters are the first priority“

2061
01:36:45,817 --> 01:36:50,516
“After Maveli..Only you are there
If you convince all men“

2062
01:36:50,655 --> 01:36:52,419
“Then you are the leader“

2063
01:36:54,425 --> 01:36:56,120
Come on man, without shyness.

2064
01:37:04,502 --> 01:37:05,469
Go man, contemptible fellow.

2065
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,265
Contemptible fellow is your father.
- Calling father!

2066
01:37:07,438 --> 01:37:08,064

2076
01:37:43,474 --> 01:37:44,635
You were here, no?
- Go dog.

2077
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:45,801
We came here in the morning.

2078
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,807
The house owners have gone to Palani.
Will be back after 2 days.

2079
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,744
Dear comrades, during
the time of election.

2080
01:37:52,183 --> 01:37:53,617
There is no political enemies for us.

2081
01:37:53,751 --> 01:37:57,187
Because of that with the religious,
communal leaderships.

2082
01:37:57,355 --> 01:38:01,258
Either cooperating or on
meeting there is nothing wrong.

2083
01:38:02,226 --> 01:38:04,320
Not that Jose, what
is Mamachan's stand?

2084
01:38:04,695 --> 01:38:06,720
Some what relaxed now.
Something must be done.

2085
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,792
That we will manage.
Do one thing.

2086
01:38:09,267 --> 01:38:10,826
From tomorrow onwards
for Mamachan's campaigns...

2087
01:38:11,102 --> 01:38:12,570
...myself and Prathapan
also participates.

2088
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,503
Prathapan has chartered
everything.

2089
01:38:14,672 --> 01:38:16,640
According to that
everything will happen.

2090
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:19,372

2093
01:38:32,123 --> 01:38:34,251
Mamacha, you take the child.
- No need. You keep it.

2094
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:35,588
Will come and take
it afterwards okay.

2095
01:38:48,372 --> 01:38:51,307
“The body is getting numb
The heart is beating vigorously“

2096
01:38:51,509 --> 01:38:57,278

Thrown in a corner that is not seen“

2101
01:39:07,558 --> 01:39:10,653
“Are hidden away from sight.
And will smile. You too“

2102
01:39:10,695 --> 01:39:16,327
“Then, who is the one who fails?
Its the people who is giving votes“

2103
01:39:17,068 --> 01:39:20,094
“For the leader and
for the winner“

2104
01:39:20,171 --> 01:39:23,163
“Ones own matters
are the first priority“

2105
01:39:24,242 --> 01:39:25,641
Dasappa?
Who is that one?

2106
01:39:25,810 --> 01:39:29,269
If you come inside, I'll chop.
Has come asking for vote.

2107
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:34,379
“After Maveli..Only you are there
If you convince all men“

2108
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:36,110
“Then you are the leader“

2109
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,690
“One who makes
promises to his fancies“

2110
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:45,593

2111
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:54,535

2112
01:39:55,506 --> 01:40:01,445
“When vote and seat is more. Ones
own matters are the first priority“

2113
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:04,613
Requesting vote for Mamachan,
the opponent candidate.

2114
01:40:04,849 --> 01:40:06,214
He and his...

2115
01:40:09,187 --> 01:40:11,656
Today also won't be there?
Then what to do?

2116
01:40:13,224 --> 01:40:15,192
Okay, let me see.

2117
01:40:16,394 --> 01:40:19,694
Okay, I'll call.
- Jose, just take this.

2118
01:40:20,364 --> 01:40:23,129
Let it get cool.
Why is the face different?

2119
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:24,693
Little tight.

2120
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:26,759
Gopi, is telling to roll
from somewhere.

2121
01:40:26,837 --> 01:40:28,362
If Gopi has said
nothing to look, just roll.

2122
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:30,567
On saying to roll, to roll this
is not 'dosa' its money.

2123
01:40:30,641 --> 01:40:33,508
Yes that is it, its money then
there is only one way out, Sholy!

2124
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:39,306
Anyway I'll not get. But if Jose asks
will get. Must ask in a decent way.

2125
01:40:39,383 --> 01:40:41,147
Will get it. She will give.
- What?

2126
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:42,878
Just ask her chain to pledge.

2127
01:40:45,823 --> 01:40:48,520
Give this there. Money I'll
arrange from somewhere.

2128
01:40:48,593 --> 01:40:50,186
Simply to make the people talk.

2129
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:53,260
What to make the people talk?
What did he mean?

2130
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:11,475
Mamachan, this is church. Have
you come here wrongly or what?

2131
01:41:11,549 --> 01:41:13,745
No, father.
- Its election no?

2132
01:41:14,118 --> 01:41:15,643
For that Lord has got no vote man.

2133
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,185
That I know.
- Then?

2134
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:18,516
Father I must confess.

2135
01:41:32,436 --> 01:41:35,428
In the state its the
final toll of campaign.

2136
01:41:41,145 --> 01:41:44,809
In the 140 election constituencies,
making the final campaigns rocking.

2137
01:41:45,249 --> 01:41:47,775
The members of the
both parties are ready now.

2138
01:42:17,181 --> 01:42:20,879
In the state the election
campaign comes to an end.

2139
01:42:21,152 --> 01:42:23,553
All over the state the final round of...

2140
01:42:23,621 --> 01:42:25,612
...campaigns were
really full of excitement.

2141
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:29,852
Jose, how was the final ceremony?

2142
01:42:30,194 --> 01:42:33,357
Its was an ocean of people. The
central minister Anand Sharma.

2143
01:42:33,431 --> 01:42:36,162
And others got shocked? Do
you know what Sharmaji, told?

2144
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:37,758
Mamachan's public
support was astonishing.

2145
01:42:38,369 --> 01:42:39,234
Public support?

2146
01:42:39,303 --> 01:42:41,567
Did Mamachan oppose?
- Was fully active, no?

2147
01:42:41,706 --> 01:42:43,572
Can't be otherwise no? To
Mamachan's left and right...

2148
01:42:43,641 --> 01:42:45,302
...Gopi, Prathapan and
I'm standing, no?

2149
01:42:45,376 --> 01:42:48,676
As the ceremony has ended
what should we do next?

2150
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:54,411
One more work is pending
the last nail on his coffin!

2151
01:42:55,619 --> 01:43:00,147
Father...
- Who is this new saint?

2152
01:43:00,224 --> 01:43:02,591
Why all the leaders at mid night?

2153
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:04,687
How is the campaign going?
- Finished.

2154
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:06,560
The matter I, told yesterday?

2155
01:43:06,764 --> 01:43:09,290
The reply for that I've
given yesterday itself.

2156
01:43:09,567 --> 01:43:12,332
Not for Mamachan for any other
person, there won't be any...

2157
01:43:12,403 --> 01:43:15,100
...canvassing from
the side of church.

2158
01:43:15,406 --> 01:43:17,204
Then what is the use of bringing
all this men and coming?

2159
01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:19,572
Not that, when we say its not
like how Jose says, no?

2160
01:43:19,643 --> 01:43:21,202
That's it!
What do you have horns?

2161
01:43:21,379 --> 01:43:24,542
When father announces...
- Politics is not my job!

2162
01:43:24,682 --> 01:43:27,413
My job is to take care of the
spiritual matters of the people.

2163
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:31,350
Not that even the Bishops used
to have certain political stands.

2164
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:34,154
Not hunger, Bishop.

2165
01:43:34,358 --> 01:43:37,350
You just say Bishop!
- Bishop!

2166
01:43:37,428 --> 01:43:38,361
Enough, enough.

2167
01:43:38,562 --> 01:43:40,530
On telling to Mamachan,
a big amount can be...

2168
01:43:40,598 --> 01:43:42,794
...given to church.
- From Mamachan's hands, no?

2169
01:43:42,867 --> 01:43:45,393
Last time when going for mission
collection, he is the one...

2170
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:46,630
...who gave the 'rubber milk'

2171
01:43:46,704 --> 01:43:48,866
Not that father, as Mamachan
is our own person...

2172
01:43:49,206 --> 01:43:51,174
...father you just
say without detailing.

2173
01:43:51,208 --> 01:43:52,403
To say without detailing?

2174
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:56,447
That is, to say, don't say.
Then if it is don't say, then say.

2175
01:43:56,514 --> 01:43:57,640
Then no need to say?

2176
01:43:57,715 --> 01:43:59,683
Must tell.
- What he said, don't say?

2177
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:01,343
That is I've suggested
a pattern to father.

2178
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:04,485
Okay let me see.
- Then announce for 3 masses.

2179
01:44:04,555 --> 01:44:06,717
To announce 3 times is
it a marriage or what?

2180
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:09,590
Not like that, but for a this.
- Okay, all go, go, go!

2181
01:44:09,627 --> 01:44:12,528
Come, come, hammer is
there in the hand.

2182
01:44:12,596 --> 01:44:14,325
That is his parties symbol, no?

2183
01:44:15,299 --> 01:44:19,293
'Salutations to the altar of sacrifice.
Salutations to the tomb of our Lord.'

2184
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:21,270
Father tell, please.

2185
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:22,533
Not telling!

2186
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:26,108
The mass which was received by
us today, for subduing our debts.

2187
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:28,235
Let it be a reason to
liberate from sins.

2188
01:44:28,379 --> 01:44:31,644
We do not know whether we will
come again or not for a sacrifice.

2189
01:44:33,217 --> 01:44:34,844
Didn't say.
- Didn't say.

2190
01:44:36,153 --> 01:44:37,814
All of you must wait for a moment.

2191
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:41,250
Dear ones, tomorrow its election.

2192
01:44:41,559 --> 01:44:42,458
Let it come out like that.

2193
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:45,860
We must elect the best ones
which is suited for our country.

2194
01:44:46,163 --> 01:44:48,291
The Mamachan as he is from
our church's jurisdiction.

2195
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:52,131
As you all are aware he is the
candidate in our constituency.

2196
01:44:52,603 --> 01:44:56,369
Mamachan has asked to all
of us to help him by praying.

2197
01:44:56,807 --> 01:45:02,405
We can all pray one minute by
closing the eyes for his success.

2198
01:45:12,156 --> 01:45:13,749
Kerala, goes to polling booth today.

2199
01:45:13,824 --> 01:45:18,284
To 140 constituencies the polling

Huge security measures.

2202

Come here, this is our candidate.
- Did you see the symbol? Box, box!

2203
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:28,262
Come, come do you
remember what is said?

2204
01:45:28,339 --> 01:45:29,329
Shouldn't change
the symbol and vote.

2205
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:31,101
Our symbol is box, shoe case!

2206
01:45:31,642 --> 01:45:34,703
Sister, this side.
- Come this way.

2207
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:37,578
Come here.
- Call them here.

2208
01:45:37,648 --> 01:45:41,175
My Santha! My God!
- Go and catch your wife!

2209
01:45:41,485 --> 01:45:44,386
What happened?
- She is near my house.

2210
01:45:45,789 --> 01:45:48,622
Who is this? Just one thing,
wants to say one thing.

2211
01:45:48,792 --> 01:45:49,588

2220
01:46:20,090 --> 01:46:21,751
At the hospital there
was a small issue.

2221
01:46:21,825 --> 01:46:22,690
What happened?

2222
01:46:35,339 --> 01:46:36,363
Where are you going?

2223
01:46:36,473 --> 01:46:37,770
Where are you going man?

2224
01:46:37,841 --> 01:46:39,468
Go man.

2225
01:46:39,543 --> 01:46:40,738
Take him and beat.

01:46:43,581 --> 01:46:45,777

01:47:05,135 --> 01:47:07,331
The time is over.

2230
01:47:07,404 --> 01:47:08,200
Told you, no?

2231
01:47:08,272 --> 01:47:10,331
To say time is over has not come
your house to vote. Give it here.

2232
01:47:10,407 --> 01:47:12,068
Move back lady.
The time is over man.

2233
01:47:12,142 --> 01:47:13,837
Where to push?
- The time is over, this person...

01:47:14,111 --> 01:47:15,579
Hey fellow come here.

2245
01:47:50,581 --> 01:47:51,446
Okay.

2246
01:47:51,515 --> 01:47:52,175
Come.

2247
01:47:52,249 --> 01:47:55,810

2249
01:48:00,157 --> 01:48:03,388
Gopi thinks something will happen.
On opening the ballot box...

2250
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:04,291
...Can see Mamachan failing.

2251
01:48:04,361 --> 01:48:05,328
Keep quiet man!

2252
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:06,085
<i>Okay GOP'-.</i>

2253
01:48:06,163 --> 01:48:07,790

With the 4 seats the UPF is leading.

2256
01:48:13,537 --> 01:48:16,268
Haripad, Mala, Neyyattinkara,
Pala on these...

2257
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:18,399

UPF is maintaining a clear lead.

2263
01:48:31,555 --> 01:48:33,489
All together it is in their support.

2264
01:48:34,124 --> 01:48:35,353
Will it go swayed?

2265
01:48:37,361 --> 01:48:41,389
Both the parties are advancing
neck to neck that is seen now.

2266
01:48:41,465 --> 01:48:44,628
Till now its not clear
who will rule Kerala.

2267
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:46,866

2271
01:48:57,581 --> 01:48:59,481
At the Puthupalli, the UPF's...

2272
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:01,177
All the eyes on lrikkoor.

2273
01:49:01,251 --> 01:49:03,481
Irikkoor will write
the verdict of Kerala.

2274
01:49:06,523 --> 01:49:09,618

vote counting is complete.

2275
01:49:09,693 --> 01:49:12,594
For the LPF 70 and
for UPF 69 seats.

2276
01:49:13,597 --> 01:49:16,157
At Kerala there is a
chance of hung parliament.

2277
01:49:16,233 --> 01:49:19,203
At the lrikkoor UPF candidate
KP Joseph wins.

2278
01:49:19,536 --> 01:49:22,506
At the lrikkoor the lead
position is changing.

2279
01:49:22,573 --> 01:49:24,701
At lrikkoor when 80% of
votes are counted.

2280
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:27,106
UPF candidate KP Joseph is
winning than the opponent...

2281
01:49:27,177 --> 01:49:30,636
...CP Mamachan with 3000 votes.

2282
01:49:33,717 --> 01:49:38,120
At lrikkoor KP Joseph is contesting
election for the 6th time.

2283
01:49:38,255 --> 01:49:39,780
For the last 5 times he had won.

2284
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:42,184
When 90% of votes are counted.

2285
01:49:42,359 --> 01:49:45,192
The lead of UPF
candidate KP Joseph is...

2286
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:48,794
We'll watch some movies.

2287
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:52,601
Mamachan, just leave
your breath. They are leading.

2288
01:49:55,272 --> 01:49:56,603
This time Kerala is for the left.

2289
01:49:56,673 --> 01:49:58,641
In the lrikkoor constituency,
waiting for the results.

2290
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:01,277
When 98% of votes are counted.

2291
01:50:01,478 --> 01:50:06,439
CP Mamachan of DNC is
maintaining a lead of 2000 votes.

2292
01:50:09,586 --> 01:50:11,680
At the lrikkoor, what is
ending is 30 years...

2293
01:50:11,755 --> 01:50:12,847
Where is that remote?

2294
01:50:13,724 --> 01:50:18,321
By rewriting the history the LPF is
coming to power for the 2nd time.

2295
01:50:18,395 --> 01:50:19,692
Did Mamachan hear that he failed?

2296
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:22,264
Swamy anyway our game worked!

2297
01:50:22,733 --> 01:50:25,794
Now there won't be any change,
there is a lead of 2,000, no?

2298
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:28,568
At first simply just got shocked.

2299
01:50:29,807 --> 01:50:32,333
Gopi has got no doubt
at all, he is strongly with me.

2300
01:50:33,443 --> 01:50:35,411
I'll manage without having
any problems to Swamy.

2301
01:50:36,146 --> 01:50:37,841
Swamy, has got
lot of thanks. I'll call.

2302
01:50:38,248 --> 01:50:39,511
Mamachan did you
hear the news clearly?

2303
01:50:39,583 --> 01:50:40,778
They are saying we have won.

2304
01:50:40,851 --> 01:50:42,717
So what?
- So what? You only told...

2305
01:50:43,487 --> 01:50:45,649
Comrade, thanks.

2306
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:48,555
Happy, lot of happiness.

2307
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:50,819
Little busy, shall I call you back?

2308
01:50:51,495 --> 01:50:52,826
What did you say?
- Won!

2309
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:55,160
Hey man did you know to
win how much I struggled?

2310
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,200
Mamacha, you only told.
- Please...

2311
01:50:57,634 --> 01:51:00,331
Sharmaji.
Thank you.

2312
01:51:00,704 --> 01:51:04,299
Thank you.
I'll talk later.

2313
01:51:04,374 --> 01:51:05,432
Give it here.

2314
01:51:05,509 --> 01:51:07,807
You and your.. Hey man
you only told...

2315
01:51:08,111 --> 01:51:09,442
...by failing here, can go to central.

2316
01:51:09,513 --> 01:51:10,503
Me? When?

2317
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:11,514
Other day to Jose.

2318
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:13,243
That I told simply.
- Told simply?

2319
01:51:13,317 --> 01:51:15,149
Till yesterday you were
not saying this one.

2320
01:51:15,219 --> 01:51:17,551
Hey fellow what all difficulty in
securing a seat, do you know that?

2321
01:51:17,621 --> 01:51:19,248
Then at that time
Gopi wants that.

2322
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,752
Then at that time I simply
created this central minister story.

2323
01:51:21,825 --> 01:51:23,259
Then at the central nothing is there?

2324
01:51:23,293 --> 01:51:24,761
At the centre the eggs
are boiled and kept!

2325
01:51:24,828 --> 01:51:27,559
Why was that poster torn
and abused that Jose?

2326
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:29,156
Did I say that?
- Said!

2327
01:51:29,499 --> 01:51:31,661
<i>Then sorry.
Hey Pasha!</i>

2328
01:51:31,735 --> 01:51:34,136
When we try to fail.
They will try to make us win.

2329
01:51:34,204 --> 01:51:36,172
Their line is to harass, no?

2330
01:51:36,506 --> 01:51:39,203
Even other wise to win an election
how much money is required?

2331
01:51:39,409 --> 01:51:41,537
If at all anything is received from
the party fund, half of it will be...

2332
01:51:41,612 --> 01:51:42,636
...snatched by Jose and others.

2333
01:51:42,713 --> 01:51:46,206
Now since the Jose's wife wedding
chain is pledged, we are relaxed.

2334
01:51:46,383 --> 01:51:48,875
Then what about Gopi's case?
- Gopi's case is gone! Come.

2335
01:51:49,186 --> 01:51:52,156
I'm not coming, at least
you should have told me, no?

2336
01:51:52,356 --> 01:51:54,154
First I thought of telling you.
- Then?

2337
01:51:54,224 --> 01:51:55,214
Then, I thought no need of it.

2338
01:51:55,292 --> 01:51:57,158
In the acting since you don't
have much experience, as I do.

2339
01:51:57,227 --> 01:51:59,525
You will have a sly look.
They will catch that also.

2340
01:51:59,863 --> 01:52:02,298
My first vote is simply wasted.
Its Maiden vote, no?

2341
01:52:02,332 --> 01:52:03,299
Its not virginity, no?

2342
01:52:03,367 --> 01:52:06,462
Mamacha, can I
believe this at least?

2343
01:52:06,536 --> 01:52:09,528
Or will this also...!
Believe me!

2344
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,335
Then we must celebrate this.

2345
01:52:11,408 --> 01:52:12,398
They have started
the celebration, no?

2346
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:14,137
Then we will rock this one.

2347
01:52:14,211 --> 01:52:16,612
Hey fellow put it down.
MLA.

2348
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:03,685
When I went to Bombay what
all things happened here?

2349
01:53:04,127 --> 01:53:07,119
Even by hitting Kuttichan and jose,
they won't look eye to eye...

2350
01:53:07,197 --> 01:53:08,255
...they became friends.

2351
01:53:08,332 --> 01:53:10,096
Mamachan became the MLA.

2352
01:53:10,167 --> 01:53:11,828
Not became, he was made.

2353
01:53:12,102 --> 01:53:14,833
You only told Mamachan will
be beaten, killed and all.

2354
01:53:15,105 --> 01:53:17,802
That was a different
game played by us.

2355
01:53:18,108 --> 01:53:20,770
If he doesn't win here he will
go to central, will we leave?

2356
01:53:21,144 --> 01:53:22,134
Is it not Kuttichan?

2357
01:53:22,212 --> 01:53:23,577
You should be really
appreciated okay.

2358
01:53:23,647 --> 01:53:26,776
We won't accept that.
Is it? - Then what?

2359
01:53:27,851 --> 01:53:29,649
Then I'll leave.

2360
01:53:30,253 --> 01:53:32,415
At the house of the Vareeth tent
construction has just started.

2361
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:34,586
Okay.

2362
01:53:35,592 --> 01:53:39,358
Okay. Morning I'll come
here to dress up the groom.

2363
01:53:40,697 --> 01:53:42,859
Shall I go?
- Okay then.

2364
01:53:45,369 --> 01:53:47,394
It will be ready, let me see
what the comrade is saying.

2365
01:53:47,471 --> 01:53:49,803
Look, here comes the comrade.
- Hey Mamachan.

2366
01:53:49,873 --> 01:53:51,602
Don't we have to sit?
- What is there on that?

2367
01:53:51,808 --> 01:53:53,298
When you are free,
come to the office.

2368
01:53:53,377 --> 01:53:54,845
We will discuss rest of the things.

2369
01:53:55,145 --> 01:53:57,375
All that let the comrade
decide and call me.

2370
01:53:57,447 --> 01:53:59,575
Okay then carry on.

2371
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:03,118
A kind of despotic look!

2372
01:54:03,186 --> 01:54:05,314
What is there?
You just stay with me.

2373
01:54:05,522 --> 01:54:07,354
When we stand united
that is benefited to all.

2374
01:54:08,492 --> 01:54:09,254
Did he go?

2375
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,590
What are you thinking?

2376
01:54:21,204 --> 01:54:22,672
Today it is her fixation.

2377
01:54:25,575 --> 01:54:27,407
The brain used by you
to win this election...

2378
01:54:27,477 --> 01:54:28,808
...if you have showed
one out of hundred...

2379
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:30,671
...today she'll be there at your house.

2380
01:54:32,849 --> 01:54:34,510
This is all like this man.

2381
01:54:34,684 --> 01:54:35,810
We will desire a lot.

2382
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:38,548
Some we will get some
we won't get.

2383
01:54:38,855 --> 01:54:40,755
The more we wish on anything
that won't be gained at all.

2384
01:54:41,558 --> 01:54:42,389
That is life.

2385
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:46,293
Leave it man.
Everything will happen.

2386
01:54:46,563 --> 01:54:50,295
For you one person will be waiting.
You wait and see.

2387
01:54:59,776 --> 01:55:00,709
Lie there!

2388
01:55:01,478 --> 01:55:04,106
Look, on going home
the house was locked.

2389
01:55:04,414 --> 01:55:07,315
Has checked the entire area
place Charley is not seen anywhere.

2390
01:55:07,684 --> 01:55:08,708
MY Lord!

2391
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:11,818
Jose!
- What is it Vareeth?

2392
01:55:12,389 --> 01:55:14,619
This proposal was brought by
you and now where is he, fellow?

2393
01:55:14,658 --> 01:55:16,683
Hey Vareeth!
Be calm Vareeth!

2394
01:55:17,094 --> 01:55:19,495
Father, how to be calm?
This is the second time my...

2395
01:55:19,529 --> 01:55:21,258
...daughter's marriage
is getting canceled.

2396
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,459
Charley won't do like that?
- If he won't do? Where is he then?

2397
01:55:23,533 --> 01:55:24,364
Leave!

2398
01:55:24,468 --> 01:55:26,527
You were the people no?
Who was with him for 24 hours.

2399
01:55:26,636 --> 01:55:28,229
Now are you justifying him?

2400
01:55:28,305 --> 01:55:30,137
Since I was with him,
what can I do on it?

2401
01:55:30,207 --> 01:55:32,369
I'll show you.
- Leave Vareeth.

2402
01:55:33,577 --> 01:55:35,443
Come here what is this man?

2403
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:38,307
You should answer this.
- What can I say?

2404
01:55:38,381 --> 01:55:41,476
Just to be little Mamachan,
I stood with Charley that is true.

2405
01:55:41,551 --> 01:55:43,713
But father I didn't know
he'll do such a thing.

2406
01:55:43,787 --> 01:55:45,812
You fellows are you
playing with a girl's life?

2407
01:55:47,858 --> 01:55:50,259
Father!
- Vareeth, you don't get worried.

2408
01:55:50,327 --> 01:55:52,261
Lord, will show some way out.

2409
01:55:52,329 --> 01:55:54,263
You tell the matter to the child.

2410
01:55:55,765 --> 01:55:59,326
Don't cry.
- Father, what will I say to my child?

2411
01:55:59,803 --> 01:56:01,328
You go there.

2412
01:56:08,311 --> 01:56:10,746
Don't cry.
Its my fault.

2413
01:56:12,582 --> 01:56:16,246
Without checking what he is, who
he is, father has fixed this marriage.

2414
01:56:17,521 --> 01:56:19,819
I never asked what is your opinion.

2415
01:56:21,124 --> 01:56:22,614
Everything is my fault.

2416
01:56:23,426 --> 01:56:24,416
Please don't cry!

2417
01:56:30,567 --> 01:56:31,557
Don't cry!

2418
01:56:34,771 --> 01:56:36,705
Not that, Vareeth
has not told anything.

2419
01:56:36,806 --> 01:56:39,673
Why, are you all gone mad?
What father is saying my daughter...

2420
01:56:39,743 --> 01:56:41,802
...should be married
to this Mamachan?

2421
01:56:42,279 --> 01:56:45,146
Hey fellow! He has studied
with my Mollykutty at school.

2422
01:56:45,682 --> 01:56:46,877
Father, how much is the
age difference between...

2423
01:56:47,150 --> 01:56:48,413
...my child and Mamachan?

2424
01:56:48,451 --> 01:56:51,113
You should not tell the
calculations of the age to me.

2425
01:56:51,388 --> 01:56:53,755
Virgin Marry at what age
did she marry father Joseph?

2426
01:56:54,291 --> 01:56:56,623
Do you know the age
difference between them?

2427
01:56:56,693 --> 01:56:58,627
I don't know.
- Okay leave that one.

2428
01:56:58,695 --> 01:57:02,063
Our AK Antony in which
age did he marry Elizabath?

2429
01:57:02,199 --> 01:57:05,328
That is what is said, there
is no point in age and all.

2430
01:57:05,402 --> 01:57:07,461
The point is on, how they live.

2431
01:57:08,138 --> 01:57:11,335
That is not required father. Now
since her marriage is canceled.

2432
01:57:11,541 --> 01:57:14,704
I just can't put her on some
one's head, just like that.

2433
01:57:15,078 --> 01:57:17,137
I also have hard feeling with him.

2434
01:57:17,314 --> 01:57:20,249
But in this situation what
father told is correct, is it not?

2435
01:57:20,417 --> 01:57:23,409
Now as Vareeth told now,
Mamachan is not just a silly guy.

2436
01:57:23,553 --> 01:57:25,317
He is a MLA now, now he is the
deciding factor, on the topic...

2437
01:57:25,388 --> 01:57:26,446
...who must rule in Kerala.

2438
01:57:26,489 --> 01:57:27,650
That let him decide...

2439
01:57:28,158 --> 01:57:29,751
...but who should marry my
daughter, that's decided by me.

2440
01:57:29,826 --> 01:57:33,126
My Vareeth, I know you have
a slight ill feeling towards him.

2441
01:57:33,496 --> 01:57:37,262
But still saying, he will take care of
your child, in a very good manner.

2442
01:57:37,701 --> 01:57:40,762
On this earth it will be Mamachan
who loves her to the highest.

2443
01:57:41,271 --> 01:57:42,705
I've seen his heart.

2444
01:57:45,175 --> 01:57:48,110
As its a confession secret
I can't say more on it.

2445
01:57:48,511 --> 01:57:51,481
You must know her soul.
I'll talk to Mamachan.

2446
01:57:51,748 --> 01:57:53,307
Father, for the time being
you don't talk to him.

2447
01:57:54,117 --> 01:57:55,846
Behind canceling this marriage...

2448
01:57:56,253 --> 01:57:58,312
I've got a clear doubt
whether its Mamachan.

2449
01:57:58,855 --> 01:58:00,482
Hey lady! Why are
you not saying anything?

2450
01:58:01,524 --> 01:58:03,288
What all things are
told by your father!

2451
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:06,087
God will punish okay. If it
were to cancel your marriage.

2452
01:58:06,496 --> 01:58:08,225
Mamachan, could have
done that much before.

2453
01:58:08,565 --> 01:58:10,499
At that time when there were that
much problems at the hospital.

2454
01:58:11,101 --> 01:58:12,762
I've called several people for help.

2455
01:58:13,436 --> 01:58:15,632
There was no one present at
that time and in the last I...

2456
01:58:16,106 --> 01:58:17,130
...called Mamachan.

2457
01:58:18,208 --> 01:58:19,607
During that time when
Mamachan and all came to Delhi...

2458
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:21,769
...told about the death
of a nurse, is it?

2459
01:58:22,245 --> 01:58:24,270
We were all on a strike
demanding an enquiry.

2460
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:25,678
But now..
- What happened?

2461
01:58:26,082 --> 01:58:29,143
The hospital management, Liza
and all in hostel room.

2462
01:58:29,219 --> 01:58:31,187
They are all locked inside.
Didn't you inform police?

2463
01:58:31,254 --> 01:58:33,552
The police and all is on their
side, can you do anything?

2464
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:34,682
I'll handle it!

2465
01:58:57,347 --> 01:58:59,179
Including the minister
all had come there...

2466
01:58:59,416 --> 01:59:00,611
...that is because
Mamachan has told.

2467
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:03,415
No one should know anything
that is what Mamachan has told.

2468
01:59:03,687 --> 01:59:05,712
That is why I've not
told this matter to you.

2469
01:59:18,702 --> 01:59:21,694
In the name of father, son
and holy ghost...

2470
01:59:33,717 --> 01:59:35,446
Look watch and learn.

2471
01:59:46,496 --> 01:59:47,622
Will he ruin it?

2472
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:52,330
Hey what is this?

2473
02:00:09,386 --> 02:00:11,150
Anything to drink?
- One half is there.

2474
02:00:11,221 --> 02:00:12,382
Then shall we go?
Okay.

2475
02:00:18,528 --> 02:00:21,361
Happy that you had come.
- As it is a good day.

2476
02:00:21,398 --> 02:00:23,560
Will tell a happy news.
- What is it?

2477
02:00:23,633 --> 02:00:26,625
Greetings to the newly
appointed sports minister?

2478
02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:28,429
Sports minister?
- What is it?

2479
02:00:28,505 --> 02:00:29,666
Can't you believe?

2480
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:33,501
Didn't I say that on hearing this
Mamachan will be shocked?

2481
02:00:33,710 --> 02:00:37,738
Comrade don't feel bad, I'm not
there to become minister and all.

2482
02:00:38,848 --> 02:00:41,545
How can that be possible?
This is...

2483
02:00:41,785 --> 02:00:43,150
...this is decided by the front.

2484
02:00:43,219 --> 02:00:44,709
All that won't suit!

2485
02:00:45,355 --> 02:00:46,754
Pacha!
One minute.

2486
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:49,554
Arrange the set up for the comrade
to have food. Comrade you may go.

2487
02:00:49,793 --> 02:00:52,728
Lal Salam (Red Salute)
The same to you also.

2488
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:54,562
So he was not shocked, no?

2489
02:00:55,665 --> 02:00:57,497
May be he might
not have understood.

2490
02:00:57,534 --> 02:00:58,865
Don't you know him?
- Why not? Who is he?

2491
02:00:59,169 --> 02:01:01,103
From 'Karippa Parambil'
- Yea, yea.

2492
02:01:02,138 --> 02:01:03,162
This was not required.

2493
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:04,764
Take one photo.

2494
02:01:05,842 --> 02:01:07,207
Girl, give one kiss.

2495
02:01:11,147 --> 02:01:12,637
Hey man, I've called and
said on your transfer, okay.

2496
02:01:12,715 --> 02:01:14,581
By this week there will
be a transfer to this place.

2497
02:01:14,851 --> 02:01:17,218
Then no need to delay much.
I'll put the bag in the car and come.

2498
02:01:17,287 --> 02:01:18,186
Okay, okay.

2499
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:24,759
Will go.

2500
02:01:25,361 --> 02:01:27,796
Thomachan, is really happy.

2501
02:01:27,864 --> 02:01:30,731
He thinks that you
have done a big help.

2502
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:31,631
Why not?

2503
02:01:31,835 --> 02:01:36,500
Hey boy, now you will at Trivandrum
so mother need a company, no?

2504
02:01:36,706 --> 02:01:38,731
That is the reason why you
had transferred him to here, no?

2505
02:01:39,142 --> 02:01:40,871
He is such a fool like this!

2506
02:01:41,144 --> 02:01:42,407
So mother understood
everything isn't it?

2507
02:01:42,445 --> 02:01:45,506
For more than 40 years I've
been taking care of you, is it not?

2508
02:01:45,815 --> 02:01:48,307
But anyway you
love your mother, no?

2509
02:01:48,351 --> 02:01:50,319
That is always there mother.

2510
02:01:50,787 --> 02:01:52,448
Shall I go?
Come girl.

2511
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:55,519
How is it?

2512
02:01:57,861 --> 02:01:58,760
Has started...

2513
02:02:02,365 --> 02:02:02,854
Hey man kept everything is it?

2514
02:02:03,132 --> 02:02:05,499
Hey boy, when are you
coming back to here?

2515
02:02:05,735 --> 02:02:08,705
Yes, on seeing uncle's cough, it
seems must return in this same car.

2516
02:02:10,206 --> 02:02:12,573
On becoming whichever big
minister, don't forget your father.

2517
02:02:13,109 --> 02:02:15,339
When I say must
not steal, you won't listen.

2518
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:18,104
But you should not gulp
everything by yourselves!

2519
02:02:18,314 --> 02:02:19,713
Should do something for the
betterment of the country also.

2520
02:02:19,782 --> 02:02:20,749
Did you hear?
- Will try!

2521
02:02:21,384 --> 02:02:22,613
He won't be good!

2522
02:02:22,819 --> 02:02:25,186
Daughter you must make him good.
Will tell all that later.

2523
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:26,723
Okay then.
- You get inside the car.

2524
02:02:28,725 --> 02:02:30,625
Hello, when the snake
bites they will inform.

2525
02:02:30,827 --> 02:02:32,693
Now, let the snake
charmer get inside the car.

2526
02:02:34,163 --> 02:02:35,528
Kochappi!
Have an eye on Jose, okay.

2527
02:02:36,633 --> 02:02:38,260
Okay, bye to all.

2528
02:02:38,434 --> 02:02:39,731
Say bye to uncle!

2529
02:02:39,802 --> 02:02:41,736
Bye uncle.
- Bye.

2530
02:02:42,739 --> 02:02:45,231
My dear sir, I've told to
comrade that I'm not interested.

2531
02:02:46,309 --> 02:02:47,333
There is no change on that.

2532
02:02:47,844 --> 02:02:49,812
Okay, again will meet at Trivandrum.

2533
02:02:50,713 --> 02:02:52,374
Why did you say don't want
to become a minister and all?

2534
02:02:52,682 --> 02:02:55,379
That is sports, no?
What is the gain on it?

2535
02:02:55,618 --> 02:02:57,245
I'm interested on revenue!

2536
02:02:57,587 --> 02:02:59,715
But still on getting a
good opportunity like this.

2537
02:03:00,189 --> 02:03:02,248
You wait and see
they will again call.

2538
02:03:02,425 --> 02:03:04,450
Other than me who
will do the oath?

2539
02:03:06,129 --> 02:03:07,460
If its revenue means can really grab!

2540
02:03:26,449 --> 02:03:29,544
Both will be happily going
to take the oath, is it not?

2541
02:03:34,123 --> 02:03:35,648
Then who is me?

2542
02:03:39,629 --> 02:03:42,291
My dear sister, I'm this devils friend!

2543
02:03:44,267 --> 02:03:47,396
I know what I did is extreme,
don't keep anything in the mind.

2544
02:03:50,139 --> 02:03:52,369
This Mamachan likes you
that much, that is why.

2545
02:03:52,442 --> 02:03:56,140
To call and tell me to play such a
foul act. That is due to severe love.

2546
02:03:56,212 --> 02:03:57,577
I was damn sure on it.

2547
02:03:58,147 --> 02:04:00,548
When a friend is in need, at that
time only we have to help, is it not?

2548
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:05,678
Has got some cheap acts with
him but he is a good person.

2549
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:08,419
Like this there is one item in
my house also, at that time this...

2550
02:04:08,491 --> 02:04:10,619
...Mamachan has helped me.

2551
02:04:11,127 --> 02:04:13,528
My name is not Charley
and all, I'm Josekutty.

2552
02:04:13,596 --> 02:04:16,122
Josekutty?
- A planter from Pala.

2553
02:04:16,366 --> 02:04:19,802
Achaya, after all the busyness,
both of you must come there.

2554
02:04:20,103 --> 02:04:23,437
Sister, don't keep anything in
the mind. Okay then Achaya.

2555
02:04:23,473 --> 02:04:25,874
Don't waste time, you
may go. I'm also going, okay.

2556
02:04:26,142 --> 02:04:26,836
Okay fine.

2557
02:04:31,814 --> 02:04:35,876
Achaya, forgot to tell you wish
you a happy..Then no need of it...

2558
02:04:36,152 --> 02:04:39,315
One beautiful life, okay.
- Okay then.

2559
02:04:42,258 --> 02:04:42,850
Then shall we go?

2560
02:04:48,865 --> 02:04:52,358
Excellent!
This beating is required to me!

2561
02:04:54,170 --> 02:04:55,729
I've done such an act on you.

2562
02:04:56,739 --> 02:04:59,265
If I wanted, I could have hidden this.

2563
02:04:59,709 --> 02:05:01,677
Then felt doing that also
towards you is not correct.

2564
02:05:02,211 --> 02:05:06,512
You might not have heard anything
good about me, Charley..No!

2565
02:05:06,749 --> 02:05:10,777
Like what Josekutty said, I also
know what is done is bit extreme.

2566
02:05:12,355 --> 02:05:16,155
Mamachan, didn't marry so far
not because of getting any brides.

2567
02:05:16,659 --> 02:05:19,128
Only because, has not seen
anyone that is liked by the heart.

2568
02:05:20,129 --> 02:05:23,394
While on seeing it, didn't
feel like losing that one!

2569
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:29,800
Even though the age is a bit
over, I'll very well take care of you.

2570
02:05:30,339 --> 02:05:33,206
Whatever it is, I'll not cheat you.

2571
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:36,645
If you can pardon me, pardon
or you can beat me again.

2572
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:40,611
After taking the oath, then there will
be bad name on beating a minister.

2573
02:05:42,852 --> 02:05:45,150
Okay then, shall we go?
Get in.

2574
02:05:52,462 --> 02:05:56,126
Hey dear worth less fellow, I never
thought you are such a cheap!

2575
02:05:56,199 --> 02:05:57,826
Son Pacha! Didn't get mother.

2576
02:05:58,367 --> 02:05:58,731
So?

2577
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:00,166
If its daughter, okay with daughter.

2578
02:06:00,336 --> 02:06:01,770
Mamacho!
- Excellent!

2579
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:07,805
I, CP Mamachan.
What is ascertained by law.

2580
02:06:08,077 --> 02:06:09,306
In the Indian constitution...

2581
02:06:09,545 --> 02:06:18,784
“The silver owl

2582
02:06:31,167 --> 02:06:33,431

2585
02:06:38,374 --> 02:06:47,476
“The silver owl

2588

“On the other side in the
cage has kept a peacock“

2589
02:07:09,605 --> 02:07:11,767
“On this side in the cage
has kept a cuckoo singing bird“

2590
02:07:12,074 --> 02:07:14,338
“After seeing it.
All wanted..“

2591
02:07:14,377 --> 02:07:22,615
“The silver owl
with the silica eyes“

2592
02:07:36,098 --> 02:07:38,294
“Silver owl“

2593
02:07:38,734 --> 02:07:42,796
“Even if its pitch dark
Can see very well“

2594
02:07:43,306 --> 02:07:47,675
“Will find out any small prey“

2595
02:07:48,110 --> 02:07:50,408
“Even if its pitch dark
Can see very well“

2596
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:52,641
“Will find out any small prey“

2597
02:07:52,715 --> 02:07:57,516
“Without fluttering the wings
Will snatch in a jiffy“

2598
02:07:57,587 --> 02:08:07,087
“The silver owl
with the silica eyes“

2599
02:08:16,772 --> 02:08:21,608
“Will fly to the sky top
Will spin the neck like a toy“

2600
02:08:21,677 --> 02:08:26,376
“Dakinies, who has got magic wand
Will sit on Dakini's shoulders“

2601
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:35,824
“The silver owl
with the silica eyes“

2602
02:08:44,867 --> 02:08:49,236
“The silver owl“
