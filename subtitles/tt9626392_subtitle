5
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,812

6
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,698

Everybody come and help me find him !

12
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:11,619
Mom sister took my geometry box

13
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:14,145
She is not giving it back

14
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:18,174
Uma..

15
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:19,275
Yes..

16
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,407
Did the kids wake up ?

17
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,165
Yes, they must be over there.

18
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:23,621
They’re over there

19
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,756
I’ll drop them at school today.

20
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:27,804
OK.

21
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,192
You should pick them back.

22
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,427
I will.

23
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:33,734
Uma…

24
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:34,777
What?

25
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:37,359
I’m..Still tensed.

26
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:38,961
Why?

27
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:42,969
This is not like what regular
taxi drivers do right?

28
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:46,137
This is like, dropping people
by looking at the mobile phone…

29
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:47,846
I am scared.

30
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:52,145
Didn’t Prasad make everything
clear to you last night?

31
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,540
Even i could grasp it.

32
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,020
You just have to pick them up and
drop them at the destination.

33
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,136
Thats all.

34
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:00,388
You will be ok with it
in just four days time.

35
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:03,086
Go, don’t beat around the bush.
Go brush.

36
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,465
Ok, I’ll do that.

37
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:06,116
Ponee

38
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:08,242
Bring your ribbon and comb.

39
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:11,524
Just sit aside and brush your teeth.

40
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,943
Why, won’t the teeth shine
if I sit here and brush?

41
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:16,400
Crazy,Sitting on the way and brushing.

42
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:21,167
Hello…Brother-in law.

43
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:24,264
No, I’m only about to leave.

44
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,026
What?

45
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,078
Nothing much brother, have
to go to the temple first.

46
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:31,605
Will go for duty after that.

47
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,316
Yes.

48
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:36,057
What ?

49
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:42,708
Yes, It’ll be familiar
with it in 3-4 days time.

50
00:04:43,681 --> 00:04:45,757
Uma says the same.

51
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,566
Yes.

52
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,076
What?

53
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:56,383
Hey don’t worry about the
vehicle, I will take care of it.

54
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:58,360
Yes?

55
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,048
Stop, stop, Let me tell you something,

56
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:09,537
Listen, don’t mess with me, or someday
i might make your car my own.

57
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,528
My dear citizens.

58
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:21,014
Dad, did we buy Uncle’s car?

59
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:24,540
We didn’t buy Uncle’s car,
but we’ll buy it soon.

60
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,531
Isn’t it August, 15th today?

61
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:27,616
Yes.

62
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,122
Aren’t you going to school today?
Yes.

63
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:30,229
Did you brush?
No.

64
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:33,193
Go brush and bath soon.

65
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:35,305
I’ll drop you both off today in this car.

66
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,714
Sister, we’re going to
school in the car today!

67
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,845
Didn’t you finish bathing today?

68
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:51,079
I’ll be done soon.

69
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:55,442
Did you see the Youtube video
I’d sent you yesterday?

70
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:57,414
Did you see the Youtube video?

71
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,709
Yes,I’d seen it.

72
00:05:58,734 --> 00:05:59,791
And?

73
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:00,913
And I’m little bit scared.

74
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:03,053
There’s nothing to be scared

75
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,400
There will be map in customer’s phone.

76
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:07,116
Just look at the end of the map.

77
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:09,229
If you notice looking down at the phone…

78
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:11,118
that person will most
likely be your customer.

79
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:14,864
Even if you could not find anyone, the
customer ’s number will be displayed.

80
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,108
Just call that number.

81
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:20,483
Whatever be the issue, you should
deal it with the pleasant face.

82
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:26,258
Don’t show attitude like the
local taxi and riksha drivers.

83
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,576
Only then you’ll get 5 star rating.

84
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,822
Only a good rating will fetch you ride!

85
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:32,383
What of somebody shows attitude?

86
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,291
Give them pleasant smile.

87
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,729
Try to control this humming of yours.

88
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:37,781
Ok.

89
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:36,078

Hold on to the steering

00:08:41,307 --> 00:08:43,002
And switch the gears

105
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:46,387
Cab, go straight after
scanning the left and right

106
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,893
Somebody is waiting on the road side

107
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:52,405
Hey cab come, cab go

108
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:55,248

Shall we go sir?

111
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:41,116
Don’t.

112
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,225
I’m telling you, don’t.

113
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,832
Whatever you say.

114
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,812
Hey..After the Punjab committee…

115
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:50,298
I was out of station for
the past two days right?

116
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:53,925
So, after the Punjab committee,while I was
attending central committee in Delhi..

117
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:57,422
Hey.. Hello. Why aren’t we moving yet?

118
00:09:58,013 --> 00:09:59,874
Start driving man.

119
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,035
So, where did I stop? Yeah

120
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,106
So, we were talking about
the meeting right?

121
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,870
I just got back to town
yesterday after the meeting.

122
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:12,628
We’re celebrating the 150th
anniversary off Das Capital. Yeah.

123
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,269
So we’re…what?

124
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:19,092
Das capital?!

125
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,596
Comrade, you sure you’re alone?

126
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:26,348
Das Capital is Karl Marx’s
“Mooladhanam” (Malayalam)

127
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:28,264
Its been 150 years since it was written.

128
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,391
Don’t let anyone hear this
Ohh,150 years?!

129
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:32,808
So coming back to matter.

130
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,922
We’re organising a meeting
on the same, a seminar.

131
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,831
We’re discussing two papers.

132
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:41,057
One is, Das Capital and Capitalism.

133
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:44,285
The other topic is, Das
Capital and Agriculture.

134
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,514
Yea, we need them both right?

135
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:49,255
So the meeting is happening this Friday.

136
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:53,569
We need to organise about
500 people for it.

137
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,109
You’ll have to scout the campus and
get some students too. Alright?

138
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:04,123
Bring some people who’re clean, without
beard or long hair. Understood?

139
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,471
Al right…I’ll send you the details.

140
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:10,564
I have it with me. I’ll mail it.

141
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:12,492
So, I don’t need to call again right?

142
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:14,238
See you one Friday.

143
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,480
All right..Red salute.

144
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:17,983
Sir.

145
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:19,128
Yeah?

146
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:20,966
I’m also a party member, Sir.

147
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:22,199
Ohh.
Yeah!

148
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,080
That’s nice.

149
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,024
What’s your name?

150
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:27,341
What?

151
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:30,155
I was asking tour name, Comrade.

152
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,845
My name is Rameshan, Rameshan.

153
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,114
Rameshan…

154
00:11:34,637 --> 00:11:35,715
Oh no.

155
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:37,671
Did he mess it up again?

156
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:40,309
Madhu?

157
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:41,933
I’m not madhu sir, I’m Rameshan.

158
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,674
Hey. I’m on the phone man.

159
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,909
Madhu…Why did you mess it up?!

160
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:51,066
We’re not dealing with petty
numbers here , Madhu!

161
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,757
No no…Please don’t start
fiddling with it again.

162
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,684
I’m coming there. I’ll sort
it out once I’m there.

163
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,208
I said no.

164
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:04,486
These people are starting to drive me mad!

165
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:06,737
Sir?

166
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:08,087
Yeah?

167
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:09,456
You hail from Kannur?

168
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:11,668
How did figure that out?

169
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:13,852
Listening to your dialect. I thought …

170
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:17,188
Yeah..The Kannur dialect!

171
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:20,010
That’s quite famous right?

172
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:22,303
I get scared just hearing “Kannur”

173
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:26,565
Hey, that’s an impression
the press created. Ramesh.

174
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,986
To be frank, Kannur
people are peaceful, man.

175
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:33,065
Trivandrum people are also peaceful.

176
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,230
Ramesh.
Yeah!

177
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,968
To be truthful… all of us comrades,
are peace lovers, Ramesh.

178
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:49,706
By the way Ramesh?
What is it sir?

179
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:54,135
Online Taxi’s are trending
now in Kerala right?

180
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:56,307
Yes sir. Indeed.

181
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:59,407
We have a union for it.
Are you a member in that?

182
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,173
No no, I just started today.

183
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,129
Ah..That is the issue.

184
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,239
What?

185
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,558
Ramesh
Yeah?

186
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,479
We need unions, Ramesh.
We do sir.

187
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:12,694
We should be a part of it too.

188
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:17,456
Capitalism always intrude
into the unorganised sector.

189
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:21,181
Do you follow what I am saying?
Yes.

190
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:25,693
The aim of the radicalists is to…

191
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:30,996
Destroy the mass base
of democratic parties…

192
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:38,403
And there by prolong or even
destroying their growth…

193
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:43,566
Its high time we realised
this!..oh..my God…

194
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,037
What is this Ramesh?

195
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:47,657
Hey, what are you doing man?!

196
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:49,594
Sorry Comrade…sorry. Sorry.

197
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:52,263
A car blocked my way.

198
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,713
People these days drive so recklessly.

199
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,369
Sorry Comrade.

200
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,835
You stop blabbering and drive cautiously..

201
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:05,584
I just put my foot on the pedal
and part lost it’s base.

202
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:07,661
Ramesh, drive carefully.

203
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:09,420
Ok.

204
00:14:09,777 --> 00:14:12,998
Comrade, you need to get
down at Muscat Hotel right?

205
00:14:13,512 --> 00:14:15,302
Its not Muscat Hotel, Ramesh.

206
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,092
Oh, So that’s not the place?

207
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:18,875
Its Mascot Hotel.

208
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:26,299
Its an online transfer…
What?

209
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,571
With my credit card.
Oh…

210
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:31,391
Just check. You’ll
see “0” displayed.

211
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:33,330
Ok. I’ll check, I’ll check.

212
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:37,475
How do I get my money now?

213
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:41,175
What?

214
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,779
Red Salute Comrade!

215
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:45,516
Yeah, Red Salute.

216
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,819
Saying Red Salute and leaving
without paying the fare!

217
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:52,788
Where do such people come from?

218
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,264
Where’s is the car?

219
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:58,623
I’ve seen this before. It’s really old one.

220
00:14:58,681 --> 00:14:59,981
Brother, Brother,Look.

221
00:15:00,006 --> 00:15:01,447
Oh. He’s come again.

222
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:03,052
You'd warned him recently right?
Come!

223
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,758
I’ll give him a peace of my mind.

224
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:07,272
Got in. get in.

225
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,243
Hey, this is an online taxi right?
What?

226
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,986
We’d warned you not to take ridesfrom the stand right?
What?!

227
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:15,173
What? We’d warned you not to take rides from the stand right?

228
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:16,199
Nobody warned me!

229
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:17,106
Nobody warned it seems!

230
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:21,138
There is no point in talking, drag him out
of the car! Get down…Get down from the car.

231
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:23,919
Get out of the car, you..
What?

232
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:25,186
That’s right…That’s right, drag him out.

233
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,943
How many times do you need to be warned?
Leave me!

234
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,203
Don’t you remember us warning you?

235
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:32,936
Leave my shirt!

236
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,125
What if I don’t?

237
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,287
Don’t take your attitude on us.
Please listen to me.

238
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:38,368
It’s my first time. I’m coming here
for the first time! Leave him.

239
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:39,824
Leave me.
You want to fight back?

240
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:42,243
Come out I say.
Gayathri! She left!

241
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,045
Let this be the final time.
What?

242
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:46,517
Don’t accept rides from this stand.
I’m warning you again.

243
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:49,431
Don’t create unnecessary issues.
You take the cab. Let’s leave

244
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:51,509
Who the hell are you to
get involved in this?

245
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,743
You can use this language at
people back at your home.

246
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:55,561
Call the police Manu!
Police?!

247
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,657
Call the police if you dare you frog head.

248
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:59,201
Who the hell do you think you are?

249
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:00,460
Its none of your
business, whoever I am.

250
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,593
Go talk like this to your dad!
You do that first!

251
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:05,496
Brother, brother. Give me a moment.

252
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,119
Gayathri.. Please…

253
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,513
I need to have a work with you.
What word?

254
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:11,576
I don’t want to hear anything.

255
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:13,735
I’m Unni’s Cousin.

256
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,580
What should I do if you’re Unni’s brother?
How did you say you are related to Unni?

257
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,206
Comrade Unni. Area Committee Secretary.
How did you say you are related to Unni?

258
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,966
I’m his cousin.
Why didn’t you mention this before?

259
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:23,574
Gopan, let them go. I know him personally.

260
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,863
Brother, you take the cab.
Gayathri, get back in!

261
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:28,856
Get in get in
Move aside, let them leave.

262
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:31,522
Ok.

263
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:35,211
Hey, I’ll deal with you later.
Sure.

264
00:16:37,808 --> 00:16:40,162
Brother, start moving!

265
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,346
What happened? The car ain’t starting?

266
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:47,622
Who is he brother?
He is comrade Unni’s guy.

267
00:16:58,426 --> 00:16:59,652
Hi

268
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,525
Greetings.

269
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,907
Shall we go?

270
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,998
You recognised me right?

271
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:10,315
Yes!

272
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,874
Oh Yes!

273
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:15,648
You’re Subhadra’s husband,
settled in Middle East right?

274
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:17,586
I’m an actor.

275
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,572
Start driving.

276
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,969
I mistook you for someone else sir.

277
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,355
There’s a distant relative
of mine Subhadhra.

278
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:28,208
Her husband looks exactly like you.

279
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,238
Hey..

280
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:31,261
Yes..

281
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:33,127
I’ve acted in 51 dramas..

282
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:34,931
108 short films…

283
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,071
And over 150 music albums!

284
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:39,244
Is it?

285
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:41,422
Hey you seen my “Room”?

286
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,488
What?

287
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:43,935
Hey you seen my “Room”?

288
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,296
How could I have possible
seen your room sir?

289
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:50,556
Hey, have you seen the short film
I’ve acted in titled “Room”?

290
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:52,309
No..i haven’t.

291
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:53,467
No?

292
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:54,754
“Orangutan”?

293
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:55,857
What “gutan”?

294
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,053
“Orangutan”!

295
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,141
Oranguttan..Orang..No.

296
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,267
“Bullseye”?

297
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,050
“Bullseye”, “Orangutan bullseye”?

298
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:03,220
Not “ Orangutan bullseye”.

299
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:06,327
“Orangutan” and “Bullseye”,
both are different films.

300
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,558
You haven’t seen anything?

301
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,670
No.no.

302
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,382
Its gone viral on youtube!!
And you haven’t seen it yet?

303
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,883
No.

304
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:15,583
That’s sad. Youtube is turning useless.

305
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:18,230
What’s your name?

306
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:19,337
Your name?

307
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:20,455
Ramesh.

308
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:24,597
Ramesh..Do you know the person who
acted alongside Surabhilekshmi..?

309
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:28,434
Who won the national award for the
best actress in the move “The Firely”?

310
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,722
Who?

311
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:31,099
Look here!

312
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,229
Really?

313
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:32,969
Yes!

314
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:34,617
Do you know what the
jury chairman commented?

315
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:35,230
Who?

316
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:37,792
The Jury Chairman! Do you
know what he commented?

317
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,127
What?

318
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,631
He asked who is this great actor is!

319
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,706
This is a rumour spreading
in the Indian film industry.

320
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:51,369
That, if I sign for a movie, it’ll
at least win a National Award

321
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:52,699
Is it?
Yes!

322
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:58,277
Do you know where they framed
the first shot of the movie?

323
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,127
Look..On my face!

324
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:01,180
Really?

325
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,228
Yes!

326
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:04,478
Oh , why did you allow that sir?

327
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:08,935
Why did you let them film your face,
for someone else’s award? Why?

328
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:12,948
This guy is a disaster.

329
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:20,059
Ramesh, try to stay silent.

330
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,827
Reduce the volume of the song.

331
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:24,266
Ok

332
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,480
Hello, is this Dileesh Pothan sir?

333
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:32,342
Sir this is Shyam, we met
the other day at Kasargod.

334
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:35,036
On the location of your movie
“Thondimuthalum, Driksakshiyum”

335
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:39,299
Your associate director Manu had
asked me to come and meet you.

336
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,550
You were having juice then, sir.

337
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,841
Could you give me something in that?

338
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:48,144
Not the juice sir!

339
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:53,132
Sir, you had assured me dialogue scene.

340
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:56,583
Is it? Are you sure?

341
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:58,625
Ok sir! I’ll call you sir!

342
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:00,160
Ramesh!

343
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:03,399
You’re really a lucky charm!

344
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,750
What?!

345
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,649
And this car too

346
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:10,306
If I get an opportunity,
I shall race ahead.

347
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:13,149
Alas, I am frantically
waiting for a good entry.

348
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:14,917
Head towards Manaviyam.

349
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:21,912
*Folk song*

350
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:25,815
130 Sir…130.

351
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,872
So, thank you Mr. Suresh.

352
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:32,350
Not Suresh, I’m Ramesh.
Oh, Ramesh.

353
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,924
I had told you all these, because
I know you are trustworthy.

354
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:40,373
Don’t share it with any film personalities
who may travel in this car.

355
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:41,982
I’ll be thrown out of the industry. OK?

356
00:20:42,028 --> 00:20:43,504
We’ll meet again.

357
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:45,210
Sir, the cash.
Oh…

358
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,767
Here you go.

359
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:55,214
See you sir.

*Folk song*

362
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:18,447
What happened?

363
00:23:18,806 --> 00:23:20,728
Nothing.

364
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:23,288
Is there something wrong?
No.

365
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:25,992
Do you want me to stop the car?
No.

366
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:35,784
Hello.

00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:40,100
Its over.

368
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:44,179
If he doesn’t desire it, let it be.

369
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:47,117
If he can forget….

370
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,474
If he can forget these 12 years..

371
00:23:49,623 --> 00:23:52,306
I too can!

372
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:57,310

373
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:09,013
Let him leave.. Let him leave..

374
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:14,031
How can I hold him back?

375
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:17,724

376
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,574

00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:31,941

beginning. Is there any problem?

384
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,447
Stop the car!

385
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,994
What’s the fare?

386
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:47,153
We’ve not reached yet.

387
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:48,858
We’ve not reached the destination.

388
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:51,027
I need to go my friends place.

389
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:52,897

00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,389
Didn’t I say I’ll buy that today morning?

400
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:47,447
What else?

401
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,018
Hold on.

407
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:03,258
Anything else? Ok.

408
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:14,922
Brother, could you bring the music down a little bit?
Oh, why not? I’ll reduce the volume.

409
00:26:16,981 --> 00:26:19,833
I’m sure he won’t reduce it.
That’s certain.

410
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:32,254
Hello. Yeah.

411
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,211
Yeah Prasad!

412
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:36,628
I’m having lunch at the restaurant.

413
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:39,680
I was about to call you.

414
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:45,565
Yea. Its not possible to behave
pleasantly to everybody as you said.

415
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,382
Some are really irritating.

416
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,316
I’ll do one thing.

417
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:53,150
I’ll come to your place today evening.

418
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:57,879
I’ll elaborate then.
Lots of stuff to tell you.

419
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:00,989
Yea, ok ok…Ok fine.

420
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:28,049
You try calling the driver.
There’s a cab approaching.

421
00:27:28,127 --> 00:27:30,086
Is this the one?

422
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:31,568
Yeah. That’s the one.

423
00:27:31,677 --> 00:27:33,263

Open the door.
Hello, hello…

426
00:27:41,476 --> 00:27:43,687
I can’t let all five of you in.

427
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:48,028
I we took the trouble to call this cab.We’ll make sure we travel in it too.
What?

428
00:27:48,822 --> 00:27:52,531
That fat guy will weigh
as much a two people.

429
00:27:52,593 --> 00:27:56,869
In that case we’ll do one thing.You get down here.We’ll take the cab.
What?

430
00:27:57,449 --> 00:28:00,070
You just drive man!

431
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:02,792
Why do I have to deal with
such people from morning?

432
00:28:02,894 --> 00:28:04,871
All if you come, destroy the car.

433
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:11,293
Why do you all want to get crammed
back there when there’s seat up front.

434
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:14,414
Lets go.
All in?

435
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:16,190
Lets go brother.

436
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:55,070
Hey bulky, come sit here.

437
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:56,772
No man.

438
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,876
Vineeth. You sit here.

439
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:05,783
Or else, you stay there.

440
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,270
You sit here man!

441
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,632
Hey bulky, sit here man!

442
00:29:13,762 --> 00:29:15,879
Let me sit there. I feel like vomiting.

443
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,336
You can’t open this window.

444
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:18,913
I feel better if I see the view.

445
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:20,264
Vomit in my hand..vomit.

446
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:22,901
What is his problem? Dude tell him!

447
00:29:25,804 --> 00:29:28,499
Dude, behave! Whats the issue?

448
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:30,265
I feel like vomiting and he isn’t moving.

449
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,812
You sir where you are. Its not an issue.

450
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:34,545
What did you say your issue was?
I really feel like vomiting dude.

451
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:38,405
Oh, the real issue is that he misses
checking out girls on the street.

452
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,633
I figure that out. Take my bag.

453
00:29:40,983 --> 00:29:44,602
You need to check out right?

454
00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:47,644
Who wants to check this out?

455
00:29:47,783 --> 00:29:50,617
What do you guys think?

456
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:52,457
Hey, I want to kiss it too.

457
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:55,160
Whoever wants to kiss the bottle can do it now.

458
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:57,193
Don’t drop the bottle.

459
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:59,837
Its scoth dude!
Take the glass.

460
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:02,245
What brother?
What the hell?

461
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:03,817
What is this? What is this?
Scotch!

462
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,630
You can’t drink inside the cab. It’ll be a huge issue if police finds out.

463
00:30:07,654 --> 00:30:08,871
Out, Out. Everybody get out.

464
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,557
Didn’t we book this cab?
Yes.

465
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,548
Didn’t I bring the scotch?
What?

466
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,408
Say “Yes” not “What?”

467
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:16,974
Listen up. If we know how to book the cab and bring scotch along…

468
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:19,773
We also know how to drink inside this cab. You have a problem with that?

469
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:23,869
If you do, you can get down here. We’ll drive ourselves.

470
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:26,610
Are you happy now?
We have bigger cars back home brother.

471
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:29,414
Start driving.
Dude open the bottle!

472
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,433
Who is listening to me anyway!

473
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:39,018
Brother, want to have one?
Do whatever you guys want.

474
00:30:39,043 --> 00:30:42,867
Glenfiddich people. Scotch Whiskey, Single malt.

475
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:47,800
Do you guys know, its 18years old.

476
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,509
Dude! Is this the way to drink?

477
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:55,261
I thought of drinking it before it ages again. It’s already 18 years old right?

478
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:59,408
You need an aristrocratic backup to drink this. Do you get me?

479
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:03,420
Pour it in a crystal glass with 2,3 ice cubes.

480
00:31:03,783 --> 00:31:07,369
First you must smell it. Then you get an urge to gulp it.

481
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:10,395
Bring the glass closer to your lips and take a sip.

482
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,373
It’ll give you a refreshing flavour. Then slowly gulp it down.

483
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,744
Ok. Pour one more dude. We’ll do it this time.

484
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:20,577
This guy won’t drive steady!
What?

485
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:22,638
You’re spilling the drink brother.

486
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:25,368
Oh, is it spilling over?

487
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,911
What a fragrance.
Cheers.

488
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:34,446
What dude! If you guys wanted to gulp it down like this…

489
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:37,415
You could have had some local brand.

490
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,519
Give me the glass. I’ll show you how its done.
Am I looking like an aristocrat now?

491
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:46,142
Do one thing brother, pour one more.

492
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:50,200
Don’t even have a family house and still talking about aristocracy!

493
00:31:53,884 --> 00:32:00,070
Why are we pulling over?
The drink won’t spill now.

494
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:01,991
Why did this guy pull over?

495
00:32:02,216 --> 00:32:05,619
Dude! What is your problem? Why did you pull over?

496
00:32:05,694 --> 00:32:07,475
You guys are drinking right?
So?!

497
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:09,483
Finish your drink peacefully. We’ll start after that.

498
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:13,201
We’ll drink peacefully. You drive the car.

499
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:17,003
Since the car is shaking, the drink will get in you head.

500
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:23,534
That will happen otherwise too. You please drive brother. Dude fix me one.

501
00:32:23,728 --> 00:32:28,376
What am I going to do with these people? Won’t even listen to me.

502
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,372
Drive brother.

503
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,506
What happened?

504
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:49,450
I swear I didn’t go anything.

505
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:53,933
Vineeth, open your eyes. He’s crying with his eyes closed.

506
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,690
This guy!...

507
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:02,484
Vineeth! Stop crying dude!

508
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:05,530
Ask him to stop crying man.

509
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,247
I didn’t do anything!

510
00:33:14,298 --> 00:33:17,142
Got a cool shot.
Hey, stop crying man.

511
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:20,767
He didn’t pull over, why cry even then?

512
00:33:20,836 --> 00:33:25,166
You sleep man.
What happened? Shall I pull over?

513
00:33:25,197 --> 00:33:27,663
What’s your problem? All I’ve been hearing is “pull over, pull over”

514
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:30,084
Don’t stop the car. We’ll drive if you’re not going to.

515
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:32,251
Can’t handle this guy anymore.

516
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:36,669
Then why is he crying?
He is crying because you pull over all the time.

517
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:38,030
What?

518
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:41,124
I am not crying for that!

519
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:45,662
Then why is he crying?
What?

520
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,529
Brother, that’s a long story.

521
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:54,014
Let him cry then.
I’ll sing you a song. You sleep.

522
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:11,833
Once you told me girl that I will come with you if you call me

523
00:34:11,973 --> 00:34:17,332
Once you told me girl that I will come with you if you call me

524
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:22,314
Once you told me girl that I am the only figure in your heart

525
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:27,659
Once you told me girl that I am the only figure in your heart

526
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:32,462
Once you told me dear that you would die with me if I die

527
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:37,731
Once you told me dear that you would die with me if I die

528
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:42,974
Once you told me dear that I would look good with a beard

529
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:48,322
Once you told me dear that I would look good with a beard

530
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:53,557
Once you told me dear that you could hear my name when your heart beats

531
00:34:53,617 --> 00:34:58,688
Once you told me dear that you could hear my name when your heart beats

532
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,528
After some wards you told me that you are trying hard even to remember my name

533
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:08,983
After some wards you told me that you are trying hard even to remember my name

534
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:14,053
After some wards you told me that some other guy came to marry you

535
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:18,786
After some wards you told me that some other guy came to marry you

536
00:35:19,189 --> 00:35:24,478
After some wards you told me that my awkward looks were not suitable to marry you

537
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:29,626
After some wards you told me that my awkward looks were not suitable to marry you

538
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,820
On that day I couldn’t understand that my friends are the only one who would be with me

539
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:39,927
On that day I couldn’t understand that my friends are the only one who would be with me

540
00:35:42,863 --> 00:35:47,402
On that day you told me that you will come with me if I call you

541
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:52,650
On that day you told me that you will come with me if I call you

542
00:35:52,757 --> 00:35:55,523
If I call you, you will come with me……

543
00:35:55,547 --> 00:35:58,578
If I call you, you will come with me……

544
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,367
Give me minute. I’ll be right back.

545
00:36:31,218 --> 00:36:34,452
God, please bring me good fortune.

546
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:40,737
Hello, hello! Get inside the car!

547
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,344
Get in the car!

548
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:47,594
Have no sense of where he is pissing!
Ok, Start driving.

549
00:36:56,806 --> 00:36:59,462
Give me, give me…the chips.

550
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:04,835
Why do you eat like this man?

551
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,197
When did you start eating this man?
Since yesterday!

552
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,597
Is that thing stuck to your hand?!

553
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:12,429
You also had from this right?

554
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:15,384
I just had once. Just one!

555
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:18,056
Dude, I need to tell you something.

556
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,434
Yes, go on.
Not you man! Him.

557
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:25,531
It was so bad on your part to have pissed in front of the temple. Its wrong.

558
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:30,534
I don’t believe in god.
What you’re saying is right dude. God doesn’t exist!

559
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:35,931
If god did exist, my girl wouldn’t have dumped me right?

560
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:37,988
That’s correct dude!

561
00:37:38,013 --> 00:37:40,208
That’s not God’s play!
Then?

562
00:37:40,485 --> 00:37:44,924
Its because you haven’t looked at yourself in the mirror.

563
00:37:46,553 --> 00:37:52,352
Don’t you look in the mirror? She won’t suit monkey face like you!

564
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:57,981
She was a hot chick. Looked as pure as milk!

565
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:01,979
He was her slave, not her boyfriend.

566
00:38:02,384 --> 00:38:07,019
Don’t think you can tease me because you guys are fair skinned. Yes I am black!

567
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:09,101
What’s the problem?

568
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:13,400
Their combination seemed like, dog poop mixed with milk pudding.
Dog poop?! You calling me dog poop?!

569
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:17,984
Dog poop?! You calling me dog poop?
What man?

570
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:24,067
You’ve been teasing me for a long time now. I’ve been noticing it.

571
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:27,172
We weren’t teasing you man. That’s how your appearance is.

572
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,083
What appearance? This how I look man.
Yeah that how you look, Its fact.

573
00:38:32,116 --> 00:38:38,204
Why do you take all this seriously man?
Hey, stay calm! Ask them to stay calm!

574
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:40,659
Please be silent.
Don’t leave him.

575
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:43,079
I’ll beat him up today!

576
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:46,860
Hey, what is this?
I’ve been waiting for the right time to hit you man.

577
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:52,298
Who is hitting me from behind? My neck!

578
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,848
Hey stop fighting in there!
Stop the car!

579
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:57,946
Don’t destroy the cab!
Stop the car man! Stop!

580
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:02,756
Why are you guys behaving like lunatics? Don’t fight!

581
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,465
Get down from the seat. Sit somewhere!
Let’s get outside. Get out man!

582
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:11,690
You want to make fun of me right?
Ohh, you want to push me? Hold him.

583
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:16,741
Guys, don’t beat him up!
Fatty, help me.

584
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:21,070
Reji, leave him,let him go.
Move aside or you’ll also get kicked

585
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:24,495
What’s with you guys? Gone mad or what?

586
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,079
Let go of me
Hello, hello.

587
00:39:27,104 --> 00:39:30,902
Move aside. Don’t block my camera.

588
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:34,515
Come fight with me one by one if you dare to.

589
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,646
Come come.

590
00:39:37,693 --> 00:39:39,701

591
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:44,006
Hello hello, move
Hey my leg! My leg!

592
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:49,856
Move, I said move. Go get in the car, Go get in.

593
00:39:50,323 --> 00:39:56,363
People are watching you guys. Get inside the car now.
Fighting for no reason.

594
00:39:56,583 --> 00:40:02,185
Come, Come with me. Everybody get inside the car now.

595
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:09,296
I need to make a point clear… leave me fatty. Let me go.

596
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:18,467
What are you guys doing?
What’s your problem. Get inside the car now.

597
00:40:19,966 --> 00:40:23,667
Say something, something to the camera.
We’ll get to beat you up one day!

598
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:29,944
You made them drink all that alcohol!

599
00:40:30,075 --> 00:40:33,364
Everybody get in now.
Reji come get in.

600
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:38,183
You mind your own business.
Come sit here, upfront.

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,280
What are you doing?
What?

602
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,815
It was fun right?

603
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:46,912
You’re responsible for this…Close the door.

604
00:40:47,013 --> 00:40:48,965
Start driving brother.

605
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:50,558
Fun it seems!

606
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:53,466
You know we were joking right. Why does he have to take it seriously?

607
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,021
It was completely unnecessary.

608
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:59,869
Why do you guys do this when you’re drunk?

609
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:02,077
Don’t talk nonsense fatty.
Don’t you have brains Reji?

610
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:05,285
Why does he have to make an issue out of a joke?

611
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,931
I can’t expect you guys to behave anywhere.

612
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:12,798
Brother, you also heard them ridiculing me.
Yes.

613
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:16,331
How would you have reacted?
Can I ask you guys something?

614
00:41:16,483 --> 00:41:21,101
Did you guys book the cab for this brawl? Tell me.

615
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,324
Why can’t you take a joke in its spirit?

616
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:26,368
I was just making video. I didn’t bear you right?

617
00:41:26,454 --> 00:41:29,759
Brother, sorry.
What’s the meaning of apologising after beating me up?

618
00:41:29,808 --> 00:41:31,393
Leave it bro.
Get lost.

619
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:33,803

Everyone got in? Lets go?

672

That dark, thin guy.
He said he’ll be back later.

674
00:47:15,128 --> 00:47:21,192
He won’t get another ride from here. It’s difficult.
He’ll be back on his own. You start driving man!

675
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:23,830
Did you guys start fighting again?
No brother.

We must go search down there brother!

691
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:13,152
You shouldn’t go to unfamiliar places like this.

692
00:48:13,242 --> 00:48:15,758
Keep moving. Keep moving.

693
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:36,106
Over there

694
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,110

Jump, jump!
I don’t know to swim.

696
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,310
Don’t know swimming? Come jump if you know swimming.

697
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:18,179
We don’t know how to swim brother.

698
00:49:28,394 --> 00:49:31,121
Search for him brother! Find him!

699
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:33,153
Where ? Where do I search?

700
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:36,543
Over there, over there.

Search brother.

702
00:50:02,634 --> 00:50:04,757
Could you find him brother?

703
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:08,031
Come help me find him, rather than instructing me from over there.

704
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:11,043
Look over there brother.
Where?

705
00:50:11,068 --> 00:50:13,542
Over there brother. He fell over there.

706
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:19,622
Look over brother. I’m sure you’ll find him.

707
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:40,210
Keep searching brother.

708
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:42,470
Brother!

709
00:50:45,747 --> 00:50:48,995
Brother could you find him? Keep looking!

710
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:51,814
Right ! Over to your right!

711
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:57,657
Brother that's the place.
I don't think he's able to hear you. Brother...!

712
00:50:58,771 --> 00:51:00,873
Right! Over to your right!

713
00:51:02,756 --> 00:51:05,318
Keep searching brother.

714
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:23,877
Reji, tell him. What ? brother..

715
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:28,529
I don’t think I can find him.
He can’t hear a thing. Brother.

716
00:51:28,613 --> 00:51:31,505
Look over here brother.

717
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,500
That’s where you can find him brother!

718
00:52:04,184 --> 00:52:06,452
Brother!
Dude!

719
00:52:12,388 --> 00:52:14,021
He found him!

720
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:21,842
What’s the guy doing? Hey..you…

721
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:25,192
What’s this man doing?

722
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,776
Oh no! somebody please help us!

723
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:35,011
Brother, come brother!

724
00:52:35,362 --> 00:52:38,844
Grab my hand
I lost him!

725
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:41,404
I lost him!

726
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:44,762
Help him man.

727
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:48,093
Where is he brother?

728
00:52:50,453 --> 00:52:54,735
Brother, where is he? Where is he?
I lost him.

729
00:52:55,141 --> 00:52:57,581
What’s the issue here?

730
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,121
Our friend drowned!
Didn’t you call the guards?

731
00:53:00,254 --> 00:53:01,676
We called him!

732
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:05,542
What have you guys done

733
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,776
Hello sir, this is sreekanth

734
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:13,283
Sir, a group of boys came into kalakkayam
sometime ago. One of them drowned.

735
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:18,174
We didn’t see it sir. We’d warned
them not to cross the fence.

736
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,988
Sir, its slippery there

737
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,496
Reji, give way

738
00:53:30,261 --> 00:53:32,592
Don’t wait, Start searching

739
00:53:33,403 --> 00:53:35,779
Search in that area.

740
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:39,147
Search over here too.

741
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,508
That’s it, that’s it…

742
00:53:48,077 --> 00:53:49,561
Slowly bring him in...slowly.

743
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:53,116
Put him on the stretcher.

744
00:53:53,657 --> 00:53:56,709
Its slippery. Don’t slip and fall.

745
00:53:57,674 --> 00:54:02,496
Bring the stretcher. Careful!

746
00:54:06,822 --> 00:54:09,996
Don’t wait. Move the stretcher soon.

747
00:54:10,303 --> 00:54:14,869
Lift the stretcher. Lift it.

748
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,946
Move, move. Start moving.

749
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:09,765
Bring them in.

750
00:55:11,827 --> 00:55:14,372
Walk faster.

751
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:36,207
Sit over here.

752
00:55:37,563 --> 00:55:39,541
Sit down.

753
00:55:41,306 --> 00:55:43,986
You can sit over there.

754
00:55:44,717 --> 00:55:48,496
Hey, you again? You’re for
the fourth time right?

755
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,622
No sir, the third time.

756
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:53,770
Whatever it is, I’ve told you not
to come without proper documents.

757
00:55:53,795 --> 00:55:54,798
Yes

758
00:55:54,828 --> 00:55:56,672
Did I ask you to put money
in fraudulent chits?

759
00:55:56,697 --> 00:55:58,712
Sir, I don’t know about it.
Please help me somehow.

760
00:55:58,737 --> 00:56:01,012
There are 100s of similar
pending cases here. Clear out.

761
00:56:01,063 --> 00:56:03,514
Sir, what about my money?
Clear out.

762
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:07,725
The proof gathering for jewellery
robbery is today. I need to go there.

763
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:10,547
Oh, I forgot about that.
When’ll you be back ?

764
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:12,180
Evening sir.

765
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,357
Can you manage it by yourself?
No problem sir.

766
00:56:14,382 --> 00:56:16,599
You may go then. Ok.

767
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:18,715
You didn’t leave yet?

768
00:56:19,034 --> 00:56:22,142
I’ll frame you in a false
case if I see you again.

769
00:56:22,324 --> 00:56:24,554
I’ll consider your case if
you can bring some evidence.

770
00:56:25,118 --> 00:56:28,458
Ok sir.
Go now.

771
00:56:28,883 --> 00:56:31,881
Do I have to request you sit down?
Sit there man.

772
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:04,335
Is it done?
Yes sir.

773
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:17,058
Sir, what about those boys?

774
00:57:17,523 --> 00:57:20,616
Let them sit there. Bring the driver.

775
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,895
Sir is calling you.

776
00:57:27,163 --> 00:57:30,586
Sir is calling you. Come get up.

777
00:57:38,277 --> 00:57:40,785
You. Come here.

778
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:44,692
What’s your name?

779
00:57:44,746 --> 00:57:46,425
Tell me your name..

00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,522
Devan.

781
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:49,000
Age?

782
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:52,994
What is your name? I’m online taxi
driver sir. Just started today.

783
00:57:53,249 --> 00:57:58,465
Just answer to the point.
Where is your house?

784
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,638
Tell me where you stay.

785
00:58:00,747 --> 00:58:04,894
Tell me your address.

00:58:05,197 --> 00:58:08,228
Tell me where is your house is.

787
00:58:09,593 --> 00:58:12,657
Father’s name?

788
00:58:12,709 --> 00:58:15,611
Louder. Mohan…Mohan…

789
00:58:15,836 --> 00:58:18,048
What was your previous job ?

790
00:58:19,498 --> 00:58:21,982
I lost my hearing aid in the water sir.

791
00:58:22,147 --> 00:58:26,140
My ears are clogged with water. Can’t
understand what you’re saying…

792
00:58:26,399 --> 00:58:28,969
Is he really dumb?

793
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:32,822
Can’t you understand what I’m saying?
Yes.

794
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:34,118
What’s the issue then?

795
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:35,269
9840

796
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,496
2053

797
00:58:36,537 --> 00:58:37,644
3421

798
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:41,531
Is the deceased your friend?
Yes.

799
00:58:41,844 --> 00:58:44,245
Ok. Go have a seat.

800
00:58:44,508 --> 00:58:47,271
Ramesh. I’m a driver sir.

801
00:58:47,348 --> 00:58:49,087
What is this man?

802
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:57,071
Chandran, take him away. Bring the boys in.

803
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:58,640
What sir?

804
00:58:58,665 --> 00:59:00,929
I said, bring the boys!

805
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:03,512
Ok. Come.

806
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:11,255
Go inside. Sir wants to speak to you guys.

807
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:20,266
Stand straight.

808
00:59:20,446 --> 00:59:23,308
Stand straight I said!

809
00:59:25,316 --> 00:59:27,686
Where are you guys from?

810
00:59:27,715 --> 00:59:29,824
You! Where are you from?

811
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,790
From the city sir.
What?

812
00:59:31,815 --> 00:59:35,105
We’re from the city sir.
Doesn’t the city have a name?

813
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:38,341
You all appear spoilt
like boys from the city.

814
00:59:39,029 --> 00:59:41,684
You guys do drink and smoke up right?

815
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:43,153
No sir.

816
00:59:43,334 --> 00:59:46,095
Don’t you smoke up?
No.

817
00:59:46,169 --> 00:59:49,434
Come here. I said come!

818
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:51,277
Over here.

819
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,474
Aren’t you drunk?

820
00:59:56,566 --> 00:59:58,018
Lying to my face?!

821
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:00,096
I’ll beat the shit out of you guys!

822
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:03,589
When did ya’ll, leave home ?

823
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:06,570
Today..Today morning sir.

824
01:00:07,513 --> 01:00:09,540
This has become a practise.

825
01:00:09,695 --> 01:00:13,485
Guys like you fall down from the top
of the hill, high on pot and alcohol.

826
01:00:13,514 --> 01:00:17,256
Do you think the job of
police is to fish bodies?

827
01:00:22,082 --> 01:00:26,683
You’ve just wasted our lives.
You guys don’t have a future.

828
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:31,854
I’ve called up your parents. Let them come.

829
01:00:31,911 --> 01:00:35,021
You’ll have time for nothing
other than court trials…

830
01:00:35,249 --> 01:00:37,005
And forget about your education.

831
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:38,566
Sir.
What is it?

832
01:00:38,785 --> 01:00:42,789
Sir, I have something to say.
Say it!

833
01:00:43,032 --> 01:00:46,367
Why are you perplexed?

834
01:00:46,874 --> 01:00:50,499
Come on, open your damn mouth!

835
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:54,402
Sir, he didn’t fall from the top.
Then? Say it!

836
01:00:55,397 --> 01:00:58,840
Sir the driver did it! Look.

837
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:12,287
Hey, what is this guy doing?

838
01:01:14,389 --> 01:01:17,070
Oh my god! Somebody please help us!

839
01:01:39,606 --> 01:01:46,722
Would you rather save your friend or
make a video when he is being murdered?

840
01:01:47,512 --> 01:01:49,555
You know the depth of the
stream better than us sir.

841
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,884
None of us knew swimming too.

842
01:01:54,626 --> 01:02:00,755
I didn’t know what else
to do in that situation.

843
01:02:33,267 --> 01:02:35,095
Phone number?

844
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:38,334
Alright, give me the phone.

845
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,410
You’ve got only one?
No, two.

846
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:43,799
Take the other phone out!

847
01:02:47,632 --> 01:02:49,898
Ok. Go sit.

848
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:55,276
I’ll keep the phone here.

849
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,648
Call that driver. That dumb guy.

850
01:03:16,652 --> 01:03:19,742
Get up. Sir wants to talk to you.

851
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:32,061
You guys wait outside. I’ll call you.

852
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:36,223
You come closer.

853
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:42,743
Stand straight, you!

854
01:03:42,926 --> 01:03:45,583
Put your hands down.

855
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,683
Why did you say like that?

856
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:50,973
I didn’t see any other way to escape.

857
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:56,198
What I say from now is the truth. I need you to back me up.
Ok.

858
01:03:56,223 --> 01:03:58,741
Who’re you stating at?

859
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:05,133
Are you trying to pull of an act saying you’re deaf?

860
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,164
What?

861
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:11,305
Are you trying to act smart after murdering someone?

862
01:04:11,397 --> 01:04:12,506
What?

863
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:15,513
Trying to act smart after murdering someone?!

864
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:19,429
Spit it out!
Sir, I didn’t murder anybody.

865
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:22,750
Say the truth.
I didn’t do anything, Sir! I was just trying to save a life!

866
01:04:22,843 --> 01:04:23,925
I’ll beat you up!

867
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:27,015
I swear sir! The boys where watching me trying to save him.

868
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:30,891
I don’t understand what you are trying to say sir!

869
01:04:31,017 --> 01:04:34,689
I swear I didn’t murder anybody. I didn’t murder anyone!

870
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:37,836
The boys had booked my cab sir!

871
01:04:39,414 --> 01:04:41,987
Don’t think you can fool us with your act.

872
01:04:42,143 --> 01:04:45,828
We have all the evidence to charge you to murder!

873
01:04:45,975 --> 01:04:47,444
I’m innocent sir.

874
01:04:47,644 --> 01:04:49,949
The boys together booked my cab.

875
01:04:50,242 --> 01:04:53,070
They made issues right from the beginning.

876
01:04:53,314 --> 01:04:55,009
We drove to the waterfall.

877
01:04:55,105 --> 01:04:59,277
One of them was missing when they
came back from the waterfall.

878
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:01,635
So I asked them where he is

879
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:04,577
That’s when they revealed he drowned!

880
01:05:04,898 --> 01:05:09,088
Everybody came with me when I asked them to come help me search.

881
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:12,440
None of them knew swimming when I’d asked them to jump.

882
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,882
I jumped into water because I was the only one who knew swimming.

883
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:19,961
I lost my hearing aid in the
stream while searching for him.

884
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:23,649
I started shivering when I came up because I’d lost my hearing aid.

885
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:24,494
Stop it!

886
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:27,219
I lose control of myself when I start shivering!
Stop it! Stop it!

887
01:05:27,244 --> 01:05:28,204
I tried saving…

888
01:05:28,229 --> 01:05:31,934
You think police officers are fools to believe this?
Believe me sir!

889
01:05:31,959 --> 01:05:34,423
You can ask the boys sir!
You don’t know my true nature.

890
01:05:34,944 --> 01:05:37,858
Take him away. I’ll make you say the truth!

891
01:05:38,807 --> 01:05:40,882
Sir...Sir, I’d like to see the sub inspector.

892
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:43,020
You can meet him inside.

893
01:05:43,096 --> 01:05:45,582
Leave me! I was just trying to save rescue somebody!
Sudheer…Sudheer!

894
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,100
Take him away.
Why are you beating me up?

895
01:05:48,273 --> 01:05:51,015
Take him away. Make him sit there.

896
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:56,381
Sir, greetings.
What is it?

897
01:05:56,422 --> 01:05:57,906
I’m his brother sir.

898
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,071
Sit, Sit…Sit down.

899
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,447
Sir, I was called from station.

900
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:09,183
What you do ?

901
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:10,720
I work in a bank, sir.

902
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,303
What about his parents?

903
01:06:13,544 --> 01:06:15,138
They’re abroad sir. They’re in Europe.

904
01:06:15,616 --> 01:06:19,542
His parents are in Europe and
he’s chilling here is it?

905
01:06:19,567 --> 01:06:21,467
Not exactly, sir.

906
01:06:22,221 --> 01:06:25,252
He’s not a spoilt kid sir. He’s a good kid.

907
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:28,244
I’m not backing him because
he’s my brother, sir.

908
01:07:23,124 --> 01:07:26,741
What are you saying? There is a procedure
for everything in the station.

909
01:07:27,195 --> 01:07:29,226
Is there a problem sir?

910
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:32,952
Shall I ask them to prepare the FIR?
Wait.

911
01:07:33,356 --> 01:07:37,098
Have to submit this in court tomorrow.
Are there any other complications?

912
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,889
Its complicated. I have
to take their statements.

913
01:07:39,914 --> 01:07:41,694
Only then can I proceed. It is complicated.

914
01:07:41,815 --> 01:07:44,931
I can only say that after the investigation. Procedures are pending.

915
01:07:44,956 --> 01:07:46,790
Wait outside.
Sir can we…

916
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,894
Wait outside. I’ll call you.
Ok sir.

917
01:07:51,052 --> 01:07:52,810
Come, Come…

918
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:04,368
Sir, we received a message about a fight in Mukkola junction.

919
01:08:05,434 --> 01:08:07,098
Ok. You drive.

920
01:08:07,699 --> 01:08:09,059
Sir!

921
01:08:09,274 --> 01:08:11,101
Sir, I didn’t murder anyone.
Go sit there.

922
01:08:11,126 --> 01:08:13,117
I didn’t do it!
Go sit there!

923
01:08:13,225 --> 01:08:14,249
Chandran, take him away.

924
01:08:14,347 --> 01:08:16,470
Tell him I didn’t murder your friend!
Did I kill him?

925
01:08:16,495 --> 01:08:19,070
Did I kill him?

926
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:20,823
Sit here.

927
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:22,770
Sit there silently!

928
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:28,376
You guys sit down. Sit down.

929
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:14,151
“This world is our home”

930
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:16,687
Shall I call the boys and the
driver to take statement?

931
01:09:16,712 --> 01:09:19,484
Yeah, call them.
Ok, Sir.

932
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:22,684
Get up and go to that room.

933
01:09:57,551 --> 01:10:00,130
I don’t know anything sir.
I don’t know anything.

934
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:02,935
I don’t understand how things
changed after I got here.

935
01:10:03,044 --> 01:10:07,845
I only tried to rescue
someone…just tried to rescue..

936
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,840
We can’t do anything about it Ramesh.

937
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:12,209
I’ve recorder whatever you’ve said.

938
01:10:12,234 --> 01:10:14,688
The court will give the verdict.
Go sit there Ramesh.

939
01:10:14,734 --> 01:10:17,601
What?
Go sit there. Go now.

940
01:10:24,174 --> 01:10:26,057
Hello.

941
01:10:26,451 --> 01:10:28,967
This is Mukkattussery Police station.

942
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:33,880
Yes, How are you related to Ramesh?

943
01:10:34,519 --> 01:10:37,472
Ramesh is in the station regarding a case.

944
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,380
Somebody came over ASAP.

945
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:01,006
Get down.

946
01:11:03,377 --> 01:11:05,697
Frisk them both before bringing them in.

947
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:07,939
Come here.

948
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,831
Can’t be sure if they’re
hiding any weapons.

949
01:11:10,863 --> 01:11:15,032
Sir, Someone’s here to see you.
Ok.

950
01:11:25,971 --> 01:11:29,527
Behave in the station. I won’t
consider you father and son.

951
01:11:29,794 --> 01:11:32,084
Did you take their statement?
Yes.

952
01:11:32,109 --> 01:11:33,691
I don’t seem to recognise you.

953
01:11:33,716 --> 01:11:37,951
I’m Purushothamman Pillai from C K Group

954
01:11:37,976 --> 01:11:39,495
Oh!

955
01:11:39,776 --> 01:11:43,190
I’ve heard about you, but I’m
seeing you for the first time.

956
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:46,288
What is it sir? Do you
require any local support?

957
01:11:46,421 --> 01:11:49,234
It’s not that…

958
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:54,709
One of the boys sitting outside is my son.

959
01:11:54,734 --> 01:11:56,914
Oh!

960
01:12:01,444 --> 01:12:05,053
He’s my only son sir.

961
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:09,605
I don’t know how he got caught up in this.

962
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,413
Is there any problem?

963
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,880
There is a problem.

964
01:12:17,036 --> 01:12:20,255
One of the boys from their
group got murdered.

965
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,193
They witnessed the murder.

966
01:12:22,218 --> 01:12:24,007
The driver is the murderer.

967
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:28,930
The case points at the driver
having had a fight with the boy.

968
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,721
Was there and arrest or..?

969
01:12:31,746 --> 01:12:33,825
No, Nothing like that sir.

970
01:12:34,512 --> 01:12:37,684
They are in the witness list, not suspects.
Oh!

971
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:39,582
Oh!

972
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:45,287
Is it possible to exclude
him from the witness list?

973
01:12:45,312 --> 01:12:48,308
Oh, I can only try sir.

974
01:12:48,483 --> 01:12:52,889
You know how complicated these cases are.

975
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:56,157
There are some procedures to be followed.

976
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:59,366
Have you had enough, now
that I’m in the station?

977
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:02,263
This should have been sorted back at home.

978
01:13:02,288 --> 01:13:04,955
You assaulted me. Shut up!

979
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,338
I shouldn’t have spared you
seeing your behaviour.

980
01:13:07,363 --> 01:13:09,004
Kill me then!
Let me get a chance to!

981
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:10,412
Let the police also see it.

982
01:13:10,437 --> 01:13:13,061
Both of you stop. Do you think
this is a market to shout out?

983
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:15,384
Creating issues for no reason!

984
01:13:16,894 --> 01:13:18,862
Where is your hometown?

985
01:13:18,887 --> 01:13:20,134
Kottarakkara, sir.

986
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:23,657
Kottarakara?! I have some
charity operations there.

987
01:13:23,683 --> 01:13:25,702
I run an old age home…

988
01:13:25,727 --> 01:13:28,633
I know sir. I’ve been
there as a guest once.

989
01:13:28,658 --> 01:13:30,729
Is it?

990
01:13:30,754 --> 01:13:34,170
So, I’ll be coming to Kottarakara.

991
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:37,257
I’ll come to your home.

992
01:13:37,282 --> 01:13:39,071
Ok sir, we’ll meet.

993
01:13:39,104 --> 01:13:41,017
What about my son…?

994
01:13:41,262 --> 01:13:43,207
Don’t worry, We’ll do the needful.

995
01:13:43,232 --> 01:13:45,484
Can I take him now.

996
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:46,602
No.

997
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:49,911
You can’t take him right away.
Some procedures are pending.

998
01:13:49,994 --> 01:13:53,287
All right. I’m leaving everything to you.

999
01:13:53,522 --> 01:13:56,984
So, we’ll meet next in Kottarakara. Ok?
Yes.

1000
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:08,523
Sit down. Sit.

1001
01:14:12,599 --> 01:14:14,185
Ok.

1002
01:14:23,228 --> 01:14:25,013
Sir, I’ll be back in sometime.

1003
01:14:25,038 --> 01:14:26,740
You, sit right there!

1004
01:14:28,787 --> 01:14:31,146
This is his wife’s residence or what?

1005
01:14:34,694 --> 01:14:36,037
Sir, Ramesh…?

1006
01:14:36,062 --> 01:14:38,441
Go in and see the constable.

1007
01:14:45,931 --> 01:14:47,714
Hey, you sit down.

1008
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:48,880
This is my wife sir.

1009
01:14:48,905 --> 01:14:50,592
You sit down now.

1010
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:54,344
Sir, we were asked us to
come, over the phone.

1011
01:14:54,392 --> 01:14:58,288
He’s in police custody
regarding a murder case.

1012
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:00,731
You talk to the S.I.

1013
01:15:01,595 --> 01:15:04,729
What is this? What happened?

1014
01:15:06,597 --> 01:15:11,328
I don’t know. I was just
trying to rescue somebody.

1015
01:15:17,857 --> 01:15:19,797
Where are the kids?

1016
01:15:19,822 --> 01:15:21,688
They’re home.

1017
01:15:24,363 --> 01:15:27,957
Motor vehicle act, 1988.

1018
01:15:28,265 --> 01:15:29,851
Sir.

1019
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:33,229
Ramesh’s wife…

1020
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:37,046
Also, let me get the bike’s number.

1021
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:39,468
Sir.
Yes, come.

1022
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,953
The bike…

1023
01:15:40,978 --> 01:15:43,183
I’ll get the number.

1024
01:15:43,354 --> 01:15:45,042
Hello sir.

1025
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:48,476
I’ll get the details sir. Ok.

1026
01:15:48,939 --> 01:15:52,564
Sir, the constable outside
said Ramesh murdered somebody.

1027
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:56,427
Ramesh won’t do such a thing.
He is innocent , sir.

1028
01:15:57,402 --> 01:15:59,761
Ramesh can never do such a thing sir.

1029
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:03,244
How are you related to Ramesh?
I’m his friend…his friend.

1030
01:16:03,447 --> 01:16:05,462
Who is she?
I’m his wife.

1031
01:16:05,487 --> 01:16:07,236
She is Ramesh’s wife.

1032
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:11,197
You please tell her, not
to cry in front of me.

1033
01:16:11,222 --> 01:16:13,717
Sir, We…
Please, don’t cry. Please.

1034
01:16:13,742 --> 01:16:16,281
You please make her understand.

1035
01:16:16,306 --> 01:16:19,412
The evidences are against
Ramesh in my investigation.

1036
01:16:19,437 --> 01:16:22,146
We have a video clip as solid evidence.

1037
01:16:22,172 --> 01:16:23,556
There are eye witnesses.

1038
01:16:23,627 --> 01:16:25,484
We have two daughters sir.

1039
01:16:25,509 --> 01:16:27,830
There is no point
explaining all this to me.

1040
01:16:27,893 --> 01:16:29,448
You please wait outside.

1041
01:16:29,473 --> 01:16:32,193
I’ll call you if necessary. Wait outside.

1042
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:34,256
Wait outside.

1043
01:16:34,366 --> 01:16:35,426
Sir please.

1044
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:37,968
No point explaining to me.
You wait outside.

1045
01:16:38,202 --> 01:16:39,507
Ok sir.

1046
01:16:44,452 --> 01:16:45,687
Ramesh brother.

1047
01:16:45,742 --> 01:16:47,311
Where do you think you’re going?

1048
01:16:47,392 --> 01:16:49,048
Wait outside. We’ll call if necessary.

1049
01:16:49,073 --> 01:16:51,315
Sir we just need to ask him…
Go outside.

1050
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,387
Let’s go.

1051
01:17:10,655 --> 01:17:12,936
Sir…Sir….

1052
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,900
Could I talk to my wife?

1053
01:17:14,952 --> 01:17:16,194
Shut up.

1054
01:17:16,219 --> 01:17:18,193
Just sit there.

1055
01:17:18,409 --> 01:17:19,800
Hey...hey…

1056
01:17:19,884 --> 01:17:22,290
What’s the matter?

1057
01:17:22,315 --> 01:17:25,052
Don’t say if you don’t want to.

1058
01:17:25,077 --> 01:17:28,048
Hey you! Can’t shut your mouth.

1059
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:34,544
Sir…About my brother…

1060
01:17:50,986 --> 01:17:52,446
Is the post mortem over?

1061
01:17:56,191 --> 01:17:58,089
We have to prepare the FIR

1062
01:17:59,598 --> 01:18:00,801
Yes, we have evidence.

1063
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,788
Yes, we have a strong evidence.

1064
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:17,180
You saw him?
Its all complicated here.

1065
01:18:17,282 --> 01:18:19,516
They say they have video evidence.
Video?

1066
01:18:20,144 --> 01:18:24,536
Yea, shot on mobile.
Don’t worry we’ll put pressure from the top.

1067
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:37,416
Sir, hello sir.

1068
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:40,559
I’m the councillor of the ward Ramesh belongs to.

1069
01:18:40,669 --> 01:18:43,638
Please sit down.

1070
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,363
What’s the issue sir?

1071
01:18:47,388 --> 01:18:49,653
He is not a troublesome person back home.

1072
01:18:50,269 --> 01:18:53,512
3-4 boys went on a trip in his cab.

1073
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:58,740
He had a quarrel with one of them, in between.

1074
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:03,043
He drowned the boy in the stream because of grudge.

1075
01:19:03,068 --> 01:19:05,181
The others have taken a video of the incident.

1076
01:19:05,213 --> 01:19:07,503
So, we have strong evidence.

1077
01:19:08,214 --> 01:19:11,249
Sir...He has some health issues.

1078
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:16,371
That might be true, but we are helpless.

1079
01:19:16,396 --> 01:19:19,613
You know it is in section 302. Murder.

1080
01:19:19,638 --> 01:19:21,996
You know the procedure right?

1081
01:19:22,021 --> 01:19:25,185
We can’t do anything about it. There is solid evidence.

1082
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:27,860
We have to proceed with that.

1083
01:19:28,049 --> 01:19:34,447
Sir, what if we could use some influence?

1084
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:39,389
As I’d already told you, this is a murder.
We’ll move according to procedure.

1085
01:19:39,414 --> 01:19:43,441
Alright then… We’ll talk later.

1086
01:19:46,054 --> 01:19:47,820
Alright then sir.

1087
01:20:02,105 --> 01:20:04,722
What is it,member?
Prasad…

1088
01:20:05,408 --> 01:20:09,088
Things are little complicated.
What?

1089
01:20:09,249 --> 01:20:11,702
There is nothing to worry. We’ll do something about it.

1090
01:20:11,789 --> 01:20:15,399
Let me go see Party Secretary. Let’s see what can be done.

1091
01:20:40,404 --> 01:20:43,148
Has sir come?
He’s inside?

1092
01:20:45,515 --> 01:20:46,984
Sir…

1093
01:20:47,098 --> 01:20:49,348
You sit down. Sit down!

1094
01:20:49,597 --> 01:20:50,839
You say.

1095
01:20:50,864 --> 01:20:54,764
Sir I gave my property to my daughter..
Its not fair what he is doing…

1096
01:20:54,789 --> 01:20:57,157
Stop it. You think this is a market?

1097
01:20:57,182 --> 01:20:58,717
Blabbering nonsense.

1098
01:20:58,742 --> 01:20:59,804
You say.

1099
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:03,825
He’s been troubling me ever since I gave
my house and property to my daughter.

1100
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:05,370
Das has also been troubling me sir.

1101
01:21:05,395 --> 01:21:07,178
What can I do if he tries to assault me ?

1102
01:21:07,203 --> 01:21:09,145
Sir, what will I do if he…
Stop it.

1103
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:11,537
Saying the same thing over and over again.
You explain.

1104
01:21:11,562 --> 01:21:15,576
I transferred my property in my daughters name after her marriage.

1105
01:21:15,608 --> 01:21:19,296
She has nowhere else to stay. He’s been troubling me ever since.

1106
01:21:19,322 --> 01:21:20,358
Now you explain.

1107
01:21:20,383 --> 01:21:22,511
Sir, he’d given her a fair share before marriage.

1108
01:21:22,536 --> 01:21:24,773
Brother in law’s alcoholism destroyed everything.

1109
01:21:24,798 --> 01:21:27,708
Dad promised me the house and made me refurbish it on a loan.

1110
01:21:27,733 --> 01:21:30,783
My family will be homeless if he gives her property.

1111
01:21:31,689 --> 01:21:33,470
I’ll make one thing clear.

1112
01:21:33,495 --> 01:21:35,734
Issues in your family should be sorted in your home.

1113
01:21:35,797 --> 01:21:37,594
It shouldn’t be a nuisance for the public.

1114
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:40,546
If I happen to get another complaint against you guys.

1115
01:21:40,571 --> 01:21:44,102
I won’t think twice. I’ll come into your home and trash you both. Understood?

1116
01:21:44,127 --> 01:21:46,147
Both of you go sign and leave.

1117
01:21:46,172 --> 01:21:48,461
Come back home, I’ll teach you a lesson.

1118
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:50,800
Sir, if I step out he will slap me.

1119
01:21:50,825 --> 01:21:52,376
Then I can some back here right?

1120
01:21:52,614 --> 01:21:55,036
Then come back once he slaps you. I’ll take care of it.

1121
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:56,544
Will you please go now.

1122
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:58,798
Pathetic, both of them.

1123
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,917
What he said?

1124
01:22:11,942 --> 01:22:14,079
I have talked to him, conveyed everything.

1125
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,577
I talked to Nelson sir but he is not helping.

1126
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:18,989
They seem to be those kid’s relatives. I’ll go and talk to them.

1127
01:22:19,025 --> 01:22:24,438
I have made those arrangement.No matter how much
we have to pay, we have to get our kids out.

1128
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,016
The kids these days.

1129
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,250
We won’t have to face anything.
Sir, one minute.

1130
01:22:28,275 --> 01:22:29,363
What?

1131
01:22:31,317 --> 01:22:34,185
I am Rameshan’s friend.

1132
01:22:34,309 --> 01:22:36,637
I don’t know who those kids are to you.

1133
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,448
Rameshan is an innocent person.

1134
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:39,884
He wouldn’t have done this.

1135
01:22:39,909 --> 01:22:41,875
My friend, I don’t know who you are.

1136
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:45,524
If you have anything to say, the
concerned authority is sitting inside.

1137
01:22:45,549 --> 01:22:46,777
Go on and talk to the S.I.

1138
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:48,106
Why are you telling me all this?

1139
01:22:48,138 --> 01:22:52,013
Sir, over there is Rameshan’s wife.
A mother of two girls.

1140
01:22:52,038 --> 01:22:53,410
Rameshan would never have done it.

1141
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:56,782
They said there was evidence, that
your kids have shot some video.

1142
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:59,624
Rameshan would never do such a a thing sir.

1143
01:22:59,649 --> 01:23:00,800
He wouldn’t kill anybody.

1144
01:23:00,825 --> 01:23:02,468
What are you blabbering?

1145
01:23:04,068 --> 01:23:05,622
You guys are rich.

1146
01:23:06,418 --> 01:23:09,285
You could easily erase this case if you want to.

1147
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:11,420
You would easily save your kids too.

1148
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:14,324
We wouldn’t even get the benefit of doubt from this station.

1149
01:23:14,349 --> 01:23:16,611
What is he talking about sir?
Stop, stop, stop.

1150
01:23:16,636 --> 01:23:18,219
Who is this guy?
Go on, walk away.

1151
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:20,290
We are just poor people.

1152
01:23:20,315 --> 01:23:23,799
Sit down sir.
What was the use of telling us all these?

1153
01:23:30,352 --> 01:23:33,125
Sir this is the F.I.R of Rameshan’s case.

1154
01:23:56,035 --> 01:23:57,711
This is the F.I.R of Rameshan’s case.

1155
01:23:59,691 --> 01:24:01,652
Are the statements by the kids clear?

1156
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:05,262
The accused Rameshan

1157
01:24:05,287 --> 01:24:11,425
Drove with Vineeth the victim, and his friends from Thiruvanthapuram
to Ponmudi in the car in which he was working as a taxi driver.

1158
01:24:11,692 --> 01:24:17,268
In between an argument broke out between the accused and the victim.

1159
01:24:17,535 --> 01:24:25,132
Due to this with the intention to kill, the
victim was taken to Mangayar water falls

1160
01:24:25,211 --> 01:24:28,133
And was drowned and murdered by the accused.

1161
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:31,817
And found guilty as per the above mentioned sections

1162
01:24:53,747 --> 01:24:56,482
Do you want to be specifically told. Sit down.

1163
01:25:01,094 --> 01:25:03,305
Why do you have to enquire about unnecessary stuff

1164
01:25:03,337 --> 01:25:04,500
You just had to drive.

1165
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:05,718
Drive the vehicle.

1166
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:09,938
He’s no more

1167
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:14,699
Brother, hiring the car around let’s go.

1168
01:25:17,834 --> 01:25:20,037
Rameshan, you are under custody.

1169
01:25:23,295 --> 01:25:25,126
Stop the car, I said stop the car.

1170
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,646
Sir is calling you. Go.

1171
01:25:34,703 --> 01:25:37,618
Brother, there is no such thing as God.

1172
01:25:43,685 --> 01:25:47,577
No matter how much angry you are, always react with a smile on your face.

1173
01:25:57,936 --> 01:26:00,612
Don’t just wander around here. Go and brush your teeth.

1174
01:26:02,087 --> 01:26:05,493
Dad, did we buy uncle’s car

1175
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:13,858
Judging by looks he wouldn’t have done this murder

1176
01:26:13,883 --> 01:26:16,245
You don’t have to think about that.

1177
01:26:16,706 --> 01:26:19,144
Produce him in court with the evidence that we have.

1178
01:26:19,169 --> 01:26:20,173
and..

1179
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:22,562
Make those kids sign the papers and let them go.

1180
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:26,520
4 of you can put down your name’s and signature’s and go.

1181
01:26:27,846 --> 01:26:29,424
Ramesha, get up and come.

1182
01:26:31,509 --> 01:26:33,103
Go

1183
01:26:40,783 --> 01:26:42,538
Sit down over there.

1184
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,320
As he’s ready for a one time settlement,

1185
01:28:08,345 --> 01:28:11,145
What is the maximum time bank can give?

1186
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:12,402
Not more than 3 months.

1187
01:28:12,427 --> 01:28:14,123
That’s the maximum

1188
01:28:19,723 --> 01:28:22,223
Bank and party is ready for settlement, your honour

1189
01:28:22,358 --> 01:28:25,248
The honourable court can decide on the timings.

1190
01:28:25,301 --> 01:28:27,481
Are you ok with 3

1191
01:28:27,506 --> 01:28:28,851
Yes sir.

1192
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:31,654
Else, action will be taken against you.

1193
01:28:39,533 --> 01:28:42,878
CC1623/2017

1194
01:28:43,187 --> 01:28:45,491
Accused- Ramesh Balakrishnan

1195
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:07,740
Proceed

1196
01:29:11,901 --> 01:29:12,961
Rameshan

1197
01:29:12,986 --> 01:29:17,551
Did you go to Mangayar on
the 15th of August 2017

1198
01:29:17,823 --> 01:29:19,776
Yes I did.

1199
01:29:19,801 --> 01:29:21,634
How did you go?

1200
01:29:22,191 --> 01:29:24,808
Sir, I was an online taxi driver.

1201
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:29,849
I went there because, all
of them booked a ride.

1202
01:29:29,904 --> 01:29:33,724
Around what time did you reach Mangayar?

1203
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:35,765
I don’t remember the time exactly

1204
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:37,823
It would have been between 2pm and 3pm

1205
01:29:37,848 --> 01:29:38,854
2 or 3 ?

1206
01:29:38,886 --> 01:29:39,971
3

1207
01:29:41,759 --> 01:29:43,423
How much time did you spend there?

1208
01:29:43,857 --> 01:29:46,734
How much time did you
spend at Mangayar region?

1209
01:29:47,801 --> 01:29:50,371
After I dropped them off there.

1210
01:29:50,496 --> 01:29:51,852
I snoozed off sir.

1211
01:29:51,877 --> 01:29:54,061
Afterwards when they came back and woke me.

1212
01:29:54,086 --> 01:29:55,593
Probably 45minutes.

1213
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,529
As per you

1214
01:29:57,689 --> 01:30:01,603
You say you weren’t at that spot
when the incident happened?

1215
01:30:01,843 --> 01:30:03,406
No

1216
01:30:03,836 --> 01:30:07,695
Then , aren’t you the one on the
video clip produced before court?

1217
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,580
Aren’t you the same person on the video?

1218
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:11,965
Yes

1219
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,793
Sir at the time of incident

1220
01:30:13,865 --> 01:30:15,741
He say’s he was not there.

1221
01:30:15,772 --> 01:30:16,856
But

1222
01:30:16,898 --> 01:30:20,201
He admits that he is
the same person in the

1223
01:30:20,226 --> 01:30:23,603
video produced before
the court as evidence.

1224
01:30:23,687 --> 01:30:24,929
From this

1225
01:30:24,954 --> 01:30:29,452
The prosecution fully convinced that
Rameshan has committed the murder.

1226
01:30:29,823 --> 01:30:31,425
Objection your Honour.

1227
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:32,934
Objection sustained

1228
01:30:41,851 --> 01:30:47,513
Do you know that, all 4 of them
have given statement against you?

1229
01:30:47,538 --> 01:30:48,835
Yes

1230
01:30:49,865 --> 01:30:51,670
The first witness Devan

1231
01:30:51,695 --> 01:30:55,444
Shot a video of Rameshan murdering Vineeth

1232
01:30:55,477 --> 01:30:58,076
And has produced it before
the honourable court

1233
01:30:58,233 --> 01:30:59,658
Do you know that?

1234
01:30:59,683 --> 01:31:00,830
Yes

1235
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:04,694
According to it, did you kill Vineeth?

1236
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:05,764
No sir.

1237
01:31:05,789 --> 01:31:06,946
I haven’t killed anyone.

1238
01:31:06,971 --> 01:31:07,980
Are you sure?

1239
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,027
Yes sir.

1240
01:31:09,052 --> 01:31:10,689
I was trying to save him.

1241
01:31:10,714 --> 01:31:12,630
Are you telling us that you are innocent?

1242
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:13,788
Yes

1243
01:31:13,813 --> 01:31:14,826
I swear

1244
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:16,480
Your honour

1245
01:31:16,505 --> 01:31:18,337
Rameshan insists that

1246
01:31:18,371 --> 01:31:19,781
He is innocent

1247
01:31:19,806 --> 01:31:21,710
And has not committed

1248
01:31:21,738 --> 01:31:24,472
To understand about the
further details of this case

1249
01:31:24,526 --> 01:31:30,180
I humbly seek permission to cross
examine the first witness Devan.

1250
01:31:30,205 --> 01:31:31,730
Permission granted.

1251
01:31:36,612 --> 01:31:38,389
Is devan your original name?

1252
01:31:38,508 --> 01:31:39,776
Yes sir.

1253
01:31:39,801 --> 01:31:41,682
The Relationship between
you and the deceased?

1254
01:31:41,742 --> 01:31:43,153
We were friends.

1255
01:31:43,178 --> 01:31:45,541
What was the intent behind your journey?

1256
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,013
It was a holiday sir

1257
01:31:48,038 --> 01:31:50,438
So we friends decided to go on a trip

1258
01:31:50,647 --> 01:31:52,950
Everybody went on a trip
to enjoy holiday right?

1259
01:31:52,981 --> 01:31:53,981
Yes

1260
01:31:54,006 --> 01:31:55,051
Did you drink?

1261
01:31:55,123 --> 01:31:56,521
Did you drink?

1262
01:31:57,616 --> 01:31:59,191
A little

1263
01:31:59,239 --> 01:32:01,802
While drunk did you have an
argument among each other.

1264
01:32:01,827 --> 01:32:03,077
No sir.

1265
01:32:03,186 --> 01:32:04,717
Then between whom it happen?

1266
01:32:04,742 --> 01:32:07,743
The conflict occurred between
this driver and Vineeth.

1267
01:32:07,768 --> 01:32:10,669
For that conflict to occur
was the driver drunk?

1268
01:32:10,701 --> 01:32:12,818
The driver wasn’t drunk sir.

1269
01:32:17,034 --> 01:32:18,522
Should the court believe it?

1270
01:32:18,547 --> 01:32:19,647
But sir?

1271
01:32:19,687 --> 01:32:21,810
All of us were drunk.

1272
01:32:21,835 --> 01:32:24,481
But it was between them
that the conflict happened.

1273
01:32:24,582 --> 01:32:26,512
Between whom?

1274
01:32:26,615 --> 01:32:27,739
Vineeth and this driver

1275
01:32:27,764 --> 01:32:29,925
The hastle between the
deceased Vineeth and Rameshan

1276
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:30,560
Yes Sir

1277
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,938
Then?

1278
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:34,739
It resulted in a small exchange of blows.

1279
01:32:34,817 --> 01:32:36,731
Then we had to separate them.

1280
01:32:36,865 --> 01:32:38,889
Then we continued our journey

1281
01:32:39,776 --> 01:32:41,040
Then what happened?

1282
01:32:41,065 --> 01:32:42,749
Then we all went to take a bath

1283
01:32:42,774 --> 01:32:46,568
He said, he will stay
back and did not come.

1284
01:32:46,957 --> 01:32:48,795
So Vineeth stayed back.

1285
01:32:48,858 --> 01:32:50,788
You guys went for a bath.

1286
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:51,656
Then?

1287
01:32:51,681 --> 01:32:54,496
After a while. We heard loud noises

1288
01:32:54,974 --> 01:32:56,943
What we saw when we went there was

1289
01:32:56,976 --> 01:33:00,910
Vineeth and the driver were
fighting each other in the water.

1290
01:33:00,947 --> 01:33:02,267
Oh is it?

1291
01:33:02,345 --> 01:33:05,448
What you saw was Vineeth and
Rameshan fighting in the water.

1292
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:06,888
Yes

1293
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:12,898
Then Rameshan was forcefully trying
to drown Vineeth in the water.

1294
01:33:12,923 --> 01:33:16,001
Rameshan forcefully drowned
Vineeth in the water.

1295
01:33:16,026 --> 01:33:17,105
Yes sir.

1296
01:33:17,138 --> 01:33:19,131
The video that you submitted was of that.

1297
01:33:19,225 --> 01:33:20,088
Yes

1298
01:33:20,206 --> 01:33:21,884
When your friend was in danger

1299
01:33:21,947 --> 01:33:25,078
Instead of trying to save him,
why did you shoot the video?

1300
01:33:25,965 --> 01:33:29,626
Sir, that was because none
of us knew how to swim

1301
01:33:29,658 --> 01:33:30,812
Aren’t you a youngster.

1302
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:31,545
Yes

1303
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,912
While you learned to drink

1304
01:33:32,937 --> 01:33:34,880
Didn’t you learn a basic
trait like swimming?

1305
01:33:35,588 --> 01:33:37,549
That’s because

1306
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:38,625
No Sir

1307
01:33:38,665 --> 01:33:40,733
Didn’t you know even a
little bit of swimming

1308
01:33:40,758 --> 01:33:41,804
No

1309
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:42,811
So you are saying

1310
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:45,685
Rameshan is the one who
drowned and murdered Vineeth

1311
01:33:45,728 --> 01:33:46,814
Yes sir

1312
01:33:49,798 --> 01:33:54,233
Did you hear Devan’s statement in front of the court?

1313
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:54,872
Devan says

1314
01:33:54,946 --> 01:33:57,477
In between your journey

1315
01:33:58,629 --> 01:34:01,039
You and the deceased Vineeth

1316
01:34:01,855 --> 01:34:03,503
Had a verbal argument

1317
01:34:03,723 --> 01:34:05,725
And for taking revenge for it

1318
01:34:05,955 --> 01:34:08,703
Rameshan took vineeth to the waterfall

1319
01:34:09,045 --> 01:34:12,311
And drowned and murdered him
Is the statement made in court.

1320
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:13,504
It’s an absolute lie sir.

1321
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:15,150
They are absolutely lying.

1322
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:16,722
After they got in the car

1323
01:34:16,807 --> 01:34:18,460
Everyone was drinking.

1324
01:34:18,631 --> 01:34:21,154
All the argument and hassles happened between them.

1325
01:34:21,623 --> 01:34:23,508
I saw them for the first time sir.

1326
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:25,443
The argument happened them.

1327
01:34:25,468 --> 01:34:25,906
Yes.

1328
01:34:25,933 --> 01:34:28,849
Nothing had happened between you of any sort.

1329
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,556
No.

1330
01:34:30,843 --> 01:34:31,804
Your Honour

1331
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:36,506
Rameshan repeatedly emphasis that
No argument of any sort had happened.

1332
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:38,102
But Devan says

1333
01:34:38,232 --> 01:34:39,804
An argument did occur

1334
01:34:39,952 --> 01:34:41,890
And for taking revenge for it

1335
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,922
The murder was committed.

1336
01:34:43,998 --> 01:34:45,414
Since these two statements

1337
01:34:45,524 --> 01:34:47,250
Are contradicting each other

1338
01:34:47,305 --> 01:34:48,821
To the Honourable court.

1339
01:34:48,873 --> 01:34:50,459
For submitting more evidences

1340
01:34:50,606 --> 01:34:53,044
And to cross examine other witnesses,

1341
01:34:53,178 --> 01:34:56,998
I humbly plead to be allotted more time.

1342
01:35:03,478 --> 01:35:06,191
On behalf of producing more evidences

1343
01:35:06,525 --> 01:35:09,909
This case has been post ponded to August 14th

1344
01:35:51,315 --> 01:35:55,441
Vineeth murder case is having a decisive turning point

1345
01:35:55,497 --> 01:36:00,716
As the strike for justice by Rameshan’s wife and kids reach 327 days

1346
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:06,747
We know that the protest has led to big discussions among Keralites

1347
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:10,453
The incident which led to the case happened on 15th August 2017

1348
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:15,400
Family is protesting to prove the innocence of the accused

1349
01:36:15,552 --> 01:36:19,252
But there is no development in the case yet

1350
01:37:02,556 --> 01:37:03,608
Sir

1351
01:37:03,722 --> 01:37:08,956
I ask permission to cross examine ASI Gokul Das
Who had prepared the charge sheet

1352
01:37:09,062 --> 01:37:10,007
Permission granted.

1353
01:37:10,194 --> 01:37:11,233
Thank you sir

1354
01:37:12,739 --> 01:37:14,161
ASI Gokul Das right?

1355
01:37:14,207 --> 01:37:15,300
Yes sir.

1356
01:37:15,839 --> 01:37:18,660
Does Mangayar come under your jurisdiction?

1357
01:37:18,769 --> 01:37:20,187
Yes, Mukkatussery Police station

1358
01:37:20,296 --> 01:37:22,741
Did you personally go the place of the incident?

1359
01:37:22,816 --> 01:37:23,761
I did

1360
01:37:24,478 --> 01:37:25,746
What did you see there?

1361
01:37:25,929 --> 01:37:28,984
Sir, we went there based on an information we got

1362
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:31,614
What was the condition when you reach there?

1363
01:37:31,883 --> 01:37:35,218
The dead body was kept on land.

1364
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:39,697
We immediately sent the body to a hospital in an ambulance.

1365
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,638
Was Rameshan present there at that time?

1366
01:37:43,696 --> 01:37:44,432
He was sir.

1367
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,000
What was his condition?

1368
01:37:46,102 --> 01:37:51,116
When we had reached there,
he was wet and tired

1369
01:37:51,454 --> 01:37:53,396
Oh is that so
Yes

1370
01:37:53,516 --> 01:37:55,021
By tired do you mean?

1371
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,546
It could have been after a physical struggle.

1372
01:37:57,967 --> 01:38:00,522
You could interpret it like that.

1373
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,314
What were the other aspects

1374
01:38:02,785 --> 01:38:05,891
Which persuaded the police to convict Rameshan?

1375
01:38:06,143 --> 01:38:09,691
Sir firstly, the evidence obtained from the preliminary investigation

1376
01:38:10,012 --> 01:38:13,279
Secondly the similarities in all their statements.

1377
01:38:13,404 --> 01:38:15,256
Then the video clip obtained from them.

1378
01:38:15,302 --> 01:38:16,462
Apart from all this

1379
01:38:16,658 --> 01:38:21,951
The contradiction in Rameshan’ s behaviour between incident spot and police station

1380
01:38:22,084 --> 01:38:25,514
Sir, he wasn’t answering to questions we were asking

1381
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,542
That’s all your honour

1382
01:38:59,277 --> 01:39:01,799
Do you remember this bag?

1383
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:05,548
Do you remember this bag?

1384
01:39:06,611 --> 01:39:08,661
Isn’t this vineeth’s bag?

1385
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:11,353
It is

1386
01:39:11,532 --> 01:39:13,290
This is Vineeth’s bag.

1387
01:39:13,998 --> 01:39:15,287
Isn’t it?

1388
01:39:15,544 --> 01:39:16,114
Yes

1389
01:39:16,189 --> 01:39:19,396
As in the bag used by Vineeth on the day he was murdered.

1390
01:39:22,278 --> 01:39:23,365
Yes

1391
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:25,625
Do you know from where I got this bag?

1392
01:39:27,324 --> 01:39:28,285
Do you ?

1393
01:39:28,312 --> 01:39:29,015
I don’t know

1394
01:39:29,308 --> 01:39:31,810
I got his bag from top of the waterfall.

1395
01:39:32,804 --> 01:39:33,476
Let it be.

1396
01:39:33,714 --> 01:39:35,847
Did you go on top of the waterfall?

1397
01:39:36,487 --> 01:39:39,373
Did you go on the top of the waterfall?

1398
01:39:40,363 --> 01:39:43,094
First we did go the top of the waterfall

1399
01:39:44,008 --> 01:39:46,550
Nothing specific happened there.

1400
01:39:46,580 --> 01:39:48,416
We simply went there

1401
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:53,179
It did not look like appropriate spot to hang out.

1402
01:39:53,484 --> 01:39:54,515
We right away.

1403
01:39:54,593 --> 01:39:55,429
Isn’t it?

1404
01:39:55,869 --> 01:39:57,348
We came back right away sir.

1405
01:39:57,603 --> 01:40:00,322
So you went on top of the waterfall?

1406
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:01,467
Disposed of the bag there

1407
01:40:01,564 --> 01:40:02,547
Came back quickly.

1408
01:40:03,383 --> 01:40:04,515
Isn’t that right?

1409
01:40:06,137 --> 01:40:06,934
That

1410
01:40:07,295 --> 01:40:08,412
Your honour

1411
01:40:08,729 --> 01:40:10,192
Regarding this case

1412
01:40:10,272 --> 01:40:14,632
In none of the statement given by these 4 people

1413
01:40:14,657 --> 01:40:17,529
Haven’t even once mentioned that they went on top of the waterfall

1414
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:19,543
As the first evident for the case

1415
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:25,265
Only after seeing the bag that I have produced before the court

1416
01:40:25,488 --> 01:40:31,950
They admit that it is Vineeth’s bag and they did go on top of the waterfall

1417
01:40:32,390 --> 01:40:36,843
It should be understood that the statement made till now were contradictory

1418
01:40:37,247 --> 01:40:43,624
It is clear that they are hiding information regarding this case from the court

1419
01:40:44,518 --> 01:40:45,831
Regarding this case

1420
01:40:46,146 --> 01:40:50,015
The second evidence I am producing before court is

1421
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,005
Vineeth’s post mortem report

1422
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:57,318
The post mortem repost and the police report is heavily contradictory

1423
01:40:58,099 --> 01:40:59,683
According to the post mortem report

1424
01:40:59,726 --> 01:41:03,543
The time Vineeth’s death is 3.30pm

1425
01:41:03,582 --> 01:41:06,816
On the video produced by the witness’s to the police

1426
01:41:06,935 --> 01:41:12,349
The time of Vinneth’s death is between 4:07 and 4:11pm

1427
01:41:12,558 --> 01:41:13,371
That is

1428
01:41:13,396 --> 01:41:15,552
The time of the death on post mortem report

1429
01:41:15,656 --> 01:41:17,515
The time of the death on the video clip

1430
01:41:17,632 --> 01:41:20,101
Is differing by 30 minutes.

1431
01:41:20,329 --> 01:41:24,534
The court should note that a big contradiction is present here.

1432
01:41:25,309 --> 01:41:27,176
Objection your Honour.

1433
01:41:28,861 --> 01:41:34,034
Mobile is just a device for us to set the time accordingly

1434
01:41:34,571 --> 01:41:35,360
Even then

1435
01:41:35,508 --> 01:41:37,303
Difference of 30 minutes

1436
01:41:37,476 --> 01:41:39,534
Cannot be considered as a valid point

1437
01:41:41,008 --> 01:41:47,249
Medical science can only give a discreet idea of mans time of death

1438
01:41:47,467 --> 01:41:50,007
If we want to know minutes and seconds accurately

1439
01:41:50,032 --> 01:41:52,620
We should be asking the medical god himself

1440
01:41:55,016 --> 01:41:56,829
Objection overruled.

1441
01:41:59,414 --> 01:42:04,809
One fact remains which even god cannot deny sir.

1442
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:07,331
In Vineeth’s post mortem report

1443
01:42:07,366 --> 01:42:09,911
A critical wound behind his head was stated.

1444
01:42:10,024 --> 01:42:12,401
For having a such wound

1445
01:42:12,587 --> 01:42:15,105
Somebody should stab him with a stone

1446
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:16,777
Or beat him with a log.

1447
01:42:16,934 --> 01:42:21,812
Or he should have slipped down and hit his head on a rock.

1448
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:25,418
Anyone of these could have been the reason for the death.

1449
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:26,350
Honestly

1450
01:42:26,561 --> 01:42:27,495
Not Rameshan

1451
01:42:27,564 --> 01:42:29,656
They killed Vineeth

1452
01:42:29,681 --> 01:42:30,406
Isn’t that right?

1453
01:42:30,431 --> 01:42:31,406
No Sir.

1454
01:42:31,431 --> 01:42:34,081
I saw this guy killing him.

1455
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:35,217
It was him.

1456
01:42:35,242 --> 01:42:37,483
From the start of the journey

1457
01:42:37,537 --> 01:42:39,787
All 5 of you were drinking.

1458
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:43,163
Getting really drink, you guys fought with each other

1459
01:42:43,292 --> 01:42:45,245
As a revenge for that

1460
01:42:45,319 --> 01:42:49,280
A deadly wound behind Vineeth’s head was stated in the post mortem report

1461
01:42:49,456 --> 01:42:52,620
Because of the fight which happened when you were drunk

1462
01:42:52,656 --> 01:42:56,550
I say Vineeth was beaten to death and thrown into the water.

1463
01:42:56,575 --> 01:42:57,302
Can you deny it?

1464
01:42:57,365 --> 01:42:58,085
No sir.

1465
01:42:58,110 --> 01:42:59,038
That’s not how it was

1466
01:42:59,063 --> 01:43:01,284
Then how did Vineeth die?

1467
01:43:02,504 --> 01:43:04,386
How did it happen?

1468
01:43:04,617 --> 01:43:06,500
That was how we told

1469
01:43:07,029 --> 01:43:08,060
It was him

1470
01:43:08,085 --> 01:43:08,782
I certainly say that

1471
01:43:09,207 --> 01:43:11,725
It is not Rameshan who killed Vineeth

1472
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:14,050
Resulting the fight between you guys

1473
01:43:14,144 --> 01:43:18,602
I repeatedly say it was you who beat up and killed Vineeth

1474
01:43:18,635 --> 01:43:20,271
Can you deny it?

1475
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:23,440
Else tell us. How did Vineeth die?

1476
01:43:23,652 --> 01:43:24,778
That…

1477
01:43:27,174 --> 01:43:29,274
Say how did he die?

1478
01:43:30,784 --> 01:43:33,424
What happened that day?

1479
01:43:36,463 --> 01:43:38,739
What happened that day

1480
01:43:43,877 --> 01:43:46,991
Bro we shall try trekking too.

1481
01:43:48,147 --> 01:43:49,722
Everyone look here

1482
01:43:49,747 --> 01:43:50,672
Smile

1483
01:43:57,177 --> 01:43:58,939
Look at the waterfall

1484
01:43:58,964 --> 01:44:00,039
Sidewards

1485
01:44:03,991 --> 01:44:04,921
Get on

1486
01:44:06,929 --> 01:44:07,801
Move

1487
01:44:07,986 --> 01:44:09,549
Its really cold

1488
01:44:09,762 --> 01:44:12,879
Rum, Rum, all can come, anyone can come
Come forward

1489
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:14,959
Open this

1490
01:44:18,425 --> 01:44:21,002
Started with scotch…ended in rum.

1491
01:44:21,206 --> 01:44:24,106
It does not fell nice

1492
01:44:25,489 --> 01:44:28,130
Rum is the rum.

1493
01:44:28,467 --> 01:44:30,334
We don’t get fit

1494
01:44:34,827 --> 01:44:37,147
Fatty give me that

1495
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:39,617
Give me

1496
01:44:39,642 --> 01:44:40,383
Give me a little

1497
01:44:40,408 --> 01:44:41,683
You have been nagging for sometime

1498
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:42,800
You would be feeling awesome right.

1499
01:44:42,826 --> 01:44:44,537
This is your final peg

1500
01:44:44,701 --> 01:44:45,493
Bring it here

1501
01:44:45,518 --> 01:44:46,432
Shut up

1502
01:44:47,772 --> 01:44:48,772
Take the glass

1503
01:44:50,376 --> 01:44:51,415
Where’s the water?

1504
01:44:51,555 --> 01:44:52,756
Go over there and take photo of ours

1505
01:44:54,325 --> 01:44:56,003
I don’t feel like it bro.

1506
01:44:56,182 --> 01:44:57,751
All that will be ok

1507
01:44:57,897 --> 01:44:59,428
Get up and go

1508
01:44:59,453 --> 01:45:01,246
Who are you to only take a pic when you feel like it

1509
01:45:01,285 --> 01:45:03,371
Where are you going all wobbly

1510
01:45:09,184 --> 01:45:10,692
He is going into the depths

1511
01:45:10,717 --> 01:45:11,713
Give that glass

1512
01:45:11,738 --> 01:45:12,549
Give me your glass

1513
01:45:12,995 --> 01:45:15,622
Praveen, why is he standing over there scratching himself

1514
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:18,798
Bro I will be over there

1515
01:45:18,973 --> 01:45:21,690
I won’t get proper depth over here

1516
01:45:23,343 --> 01:45:25,084
Don’t you want to take a photo
Ready

1517
01:45:25,117 --> 01:45:25,653
Come

1518
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:28,059
Bro, ready…are you ready?

1519
01:45:29,744 --> 01:45:31,720
Come he will take a pic

1520
01:45:31,745 --> 01:45:32,601
Come

1521
01:45:32,754 --> 01:45:33,690
What’s wrong with him ?

1522
01:45:33,715 --> 01:45:34,351
Everything is ready

1523
01:45:34,376 --> 01:45:35,114
Reji come

1524
01:45:35,139 --> 01:45:35,858
Nice nice
Ready

1525
01:45:35,883 --> 01:45:36,735
Wide first

1526
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,725
Take take

1527
01:45:38,193 --> 01:45:39,807
Be sure to click everything

1528
01:45:39,832 --> 01:45:40,614
Not just us

1529
01:45:41,256 --> 01:45:42,069
Focus on me

1530
01:45:42,094 --> 01:45:43,008
Nice nice

1531
01:45:46,529 --> 01:45:48,409
One more one more

1532
01:45:50,408 --> 01:45:52,036
Don’t scream

1533
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,860
Smile… smile

1534
01:46:36,515 --> 01:46:37,915
Let’s go that way and look

1535
01:46:37,963 --> 01:46:38,986
There’s nobody here

1536
01:46:39,011 --> 01:46:40,316
You guys just shut up

1537
01:46:40,341 --> 01:46:41,246
Just shut up

1538
01:46:41,272 --> 01:46:42,366
Listen to me

1539
01:46:42,624 --> 01:46:44,782
We did not come here, and haven’t seen him too

1540
01:46:44,807 --> 01:46:45,681
Understand?

1541
01:46:45,706 --> 01:46:47,264
Just tell that to anyone who asks.

1542
01:46:47,454 --> 01:46:49,840
Didn’t that driver see that he came with us?

1543
01:46:49,993 --> 01:46:51,126
I’ll take care of that driver

1544
01:46:51,696 --> 01:46:53,795
I’ll talk to him, just stand by me

1545
01:46:54,113 --> 01:46:55,324
Let’s save him

1546
01:46:56,046 --> 01:46:57,827
Do you know how to swim?

1547
01:46:58,593 --> 01:47:00,720
Then what are you talking about

1548
01:47:01,023 --> 01:47:02,662
Just do as I say

1549
01:47:02,796 --> 01:47:04,475
Or else, everybody will be trapped

1550
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:05,279
Understand?

1551
01:47:05,304 --> 01:47:06,507
Shall we go then?

1552
01:47:06,881 --> 01:47:08,430
Let’s get out here immediately

1553
01:47:08,461 --> 01:47:09,553
Else there’s going to be trouble

1554
01:47:09,578 --> 01:47:10,973
Lets call somebody who know’s swimming

1555
01:47:10,998 --> 01:47:12,623
There is nothing we
can do, he fell off

1556
01:47:12,867 --> 01:47:14,764
Will anybody survive such a fall ?

1557
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:15,710
Try to understand that

1558
01:47:15,735 --> 01:47:16,977
Still isn’t he our friend

1559
01:47:17,002 --> 01:47:19,518
How can we just abandon him

1560
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:20,868
Not abandoning

1561
01:47:20,951 --> 01:47:22,006
But he

1562
01:47:22,031 --> 01:47:23,551
Weren’t you the one who fought with him

1563
01:47:23,668 --> 01:47:24,785
I don’t have any issue

1564
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:26,364
It was all of you that beat him

1565
01:47:27,043 --> 01:47:28,647
That driver knows about all this

1566
01:47:28,848 --> 01:47:30,178
If he hears about any of this.

1567
01:47:30,203 --> 01:47:31,835
He will say we killed him

1568
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,259
I won’t get caught,
but you guys will

1569
01:47:33,354 --> 01:47:35,229
You guys were the ones who beat him up

1570
01:47:35,255 --> 01:47:36,216
Right?

1571
01:47:36,391 --> 01:47:37,836
I didn’t do anything anyways

1572
01:47:37,892 --> 01:47:38,812
I’ll escape from this

1573
01:47:38,837 --> 01:47:40,013
You know me right

1574
01:47:41,629 --> 01:47:42,908
Let’s go then

1575
01:47:42,933 --> 01:47:43,722
Come on

1576
01:47:43,921 --> 01:47:44,484
Fast

1577
01:47:44,653 --> 01:47:45,599
You come

1578
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:47,646
Take those stuff

1579
01:47:48,337 --> 01:47:50,446
Take it, take it fast

1580
01:47:50,722 --> 01:47:52,191
Don’t take that bag

1581
01:47:52,309 --> 01:47:53,466
Just take out stuff

1582
01:47:53,491 --> 01:47:54,107
Fast

1583
01:47:54,132 --> 01:47:55,785
Come on, come fast

1584
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:57,110
I’ll take my bag

1585
01:47:58,282 --> 01:48:00,126
Bro help me out

1586
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:03,898
Climb up fast

1587
01:48:04,374 --> 01:48:06,116
I am getting really scared

1588
01:48:10,405 --> 01:48:11,241
Come fast

1589
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:21,706
Get in

1590
01:48:21,964 --> 01:48:23,119
I’ll talk to him

1591
01:48:23,363 --> 01:48:24,723
Don’t you say anything

1592
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:25,941
Remember what told you right

1593
01:48:26,078 --> 01:48:27,124
None of you should talk

1594
01:48:27,555 --> 01:48:28,446
Its our life

1595
01:48:33,315 --> 01:48:34,986
Brother

1596
01:48:49,702 --> 01:48:55,291
I am submitting a crucial evidence regarding this case to the court

1597
01:49:01,054 --> 01:49:06,749
These are some pictures taken on Vineeth’s mobile before his death

1598
01:49:06,782 --> 01:49:09,085
The time on the last picture

1599
01:49:14,113 --> 01:49:17,008
But on he video produced before court

1600
01:49:17,033 --> 01:49:21,008
The accused seems to have used physical force.

1601
01:49:22,099 --> 01:49:23,080
It is true sir

1602
01:49:23,113 --> 01:49:26,026
That thought might seem true up on seeing the video

1603
01:49:26,051 --> 01:49:28,742
I have produced a medical certificate before you

1604
01:49:29,024 --> 01:49:31,696
During the time that Ramesh worked in Dubai

1605
01:49:31,723 --> 01:49:34,246
He met with an accident

1606
01:49:34,271 --> 01:49:35,978
Because of that accident

1607
01:49:36,003 --> 01:49:38,435
Hearing sounds above certain frequencies

1608
01:49:38,462 --> 01:49:43,515
Can make him start behaving abnormally.
He is facing such a disease

1609
01:49:43,694 --> 01:49:46,773
When he dived in to the water to save Vineeth

1610
01:49:46,798 --> 01:49:52,846
Up on loosing his hearing aid, the abnormal behaviour was triggered

1611
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:56,578
Rameshan had conveyed this to the police

1612
01:49:56,605 --> 01:49:59,464
But the police hasn’t recorded this in any of their reports

1613
01:49:59,626 --> 01:50:07,941
Abnormal behaviour was recorded by the witnesses and produced before the court
And framed as Rameshan trying to kill Vineeth

1614
01:50:08,215 --> 01:50:12,074
Sir, when all other photos and videos are deleted from phone

1615
01:50:12,099 --> 01:50:15,526
And when only video was submitted as evidence

1616
01:50:15,551 --> 01:50:18,022
There underlies a big lie in it sir

1617
01:50:18,046 --> 01:50:21,875
We are living in a country where lot of legends have lived

1618
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:24,953
And I am bound to say helplessly that

1619
01:50:25,727 --> 01:50:32,515
These 4 youngster’s are an example of how our society should not be

1620
01:50:32,895 --> 01:50:35,004
Rameshan is not just a name sir

1621
01:50:35,418 --> 01:50:40,166
A lot of such people are entwined in our judicial system like this

1622
01:50:40,191 --> 01:50:41,243
To conclude

1623
01:50:41,268 --> 01:50:44,777
Based on the evidences and witnesses produced

1624
01:50:45,197 --> 01:50:46,877
This case should be re examined

1625
01:50:46,902 --> 01:50:52,728
And since my client Rameshan been prove innocent before the court

1626
01:50:52,753 --> 01:50:58,167
I humbly plead that he may be excused from this case

1627
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,597
That’s all your honour

1628
01:51:01,378 --> 01:51:04,407
Does the prosecution have anything to say

1629
01:51:04,675 --> 01:51:05,443
No sir

1630
01:51:05,477 --> 01:51:07,022
Prosecution rests

1631
01:51:17,242 --> 01:51:22,095
Vineeth murder case is having a decisive turning point

1632
01:51:22,309 --> 01:51:29,306
Rameshan’s family is positive about the direction of the case

1633
01:51:29,774 --> 01:51:34,276
After hearing both the defence and prosecution arguments

1634
01:51:34,487 --> 01:51:36,085
The court understands that

1635
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:40,810
This case was fabricated by the witnesses to convict Rameshan

1636
01:51:40,987 --> 01:51:42,708
Up on creating circumstantial evidences

1637
01:51:42,733 --> 01:51:45,477
And by misleading the prosecution

1638
01:51:45,604 --> 01:51:47,917
The court has lost its faith in them

1639
01:51:48,327 --> 01:51:53,163
Since the prosecution has failed to prove Rameshan is guilty

1640
01:51:53,390 --> 01:51:56,208
This court is setting Rameshan free

1641
01:51:56,233 --> 01:51:59,891
And for misleading the court with fake evidences

1642
01:51:59,916 --> 01:52:02,260
The witnesses are fined 1 lakh rupees each

1643
01:52:02,425 --> 01:52:05,749
And for misdirecting the investigation

1644
01:52:05,862 --> 01:52:09,355
The police is hear by criticised in a serious tone by the court

1645
01:52:10,257 --> 01:52:14,936
The court orders this case to be re examined

1646
01:52:22,332 --> 01:52:25,301
Prasad you don’t have to rush and come here

1647
01:52:26,502 --> 01:52:28,690
We are coming over there

1648
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:31,165
You stay right there

1649
01:52:32,191 --> 01:52:34,058
Yes, yes

1650
01:52:49,734 --> 01:52:51,914
Here take this

1651
01:53:14,679 --> 01:53:16,398
Come

1652
01:53:20,024 --> 01:53:21,931
Start the car confidently

1653
01:53:21,956 --> 01:53:24,088
Take

1654
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:43,232
Dad

1655
01:53:43,494 --> 01:53:45,269
Start it

1656
01:53:49,245 --> 01:53:52,353
Start the car
