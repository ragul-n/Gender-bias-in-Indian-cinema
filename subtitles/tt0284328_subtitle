1
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,400
"I want to reside
in your heart."

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,600
"I want to reside
in your heart."

3
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,720
"In your dreams,
arms, breath, eyes"

4
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,720
"I want to reside."

5
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,320
"I want to reside
in your heart."

6
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,760
"I want to reside
in your heart."

7
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,760
"I want to reside in your
dreams, arms, breath and eyes."

8
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,240
"I want to say something.."

9
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,080
"I want to reside
in your heart."

10
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,440
"I want to reside
in your heart."

11
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,560
"I want to reside in your
dreams, arms, breath and eyes."

12
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,000
"I want to say something.."

13
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,000
"I want to say something.."

14
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,560
"Should I say it to you
or to this breeze?"

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,320
"Or should I say it to
your beautiful hair?"

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,040
"Should I say it to you
or to this breeze?"

17
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,720
"Or should I say it to
your beautiful hair?"

18
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
"I am lost and
want to stay lost"

19
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,240
"in your love."

20
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,880
"I want to say something.."

21
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,880
"I want to say something."

22
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,240
"Who let the dogs out? Who.."

23
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,000
"Who.."

24
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,560
"Who let the dogs out? Who.."

25
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
"Who let the dogs out? Who.."

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,400
Hey, I am feeling very tense.
- Why?

27
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,240
We need a partner
to go to the disco.

28
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,320
But all of us are
without partners.

29
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,320
Don't worry. There'll be many others
like us without dancing partners.

30
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,320
We can select our dancing
partners out of them.

31
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Welcome..

32
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,040
Girls, do you want
dancing partners?

33
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,040
Yes.. - Okay. Come on, boys..

34
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,000
My dear girls, get ready
to choose your partners.

35
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,640
Come on. Boy number one.

36
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,640
Oh, no. Boy number two.

37
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,280
Boy number three. - Come on.

38
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,640
Very good!

39
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,760
Very good..

40
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,760
Okay! Enjoy.

41
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,880
Great! This girl hasn't
chosen her partner yet!

42
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,040
Sweeties, you still haven't
found a partner of your choice!

43
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,120
We have!

44
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,120
Who? - Him!

45
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,560
Him? He is Karan.
My dearest nephew.

46
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,560
Come here, my dear. You've
won a lottery! Come on!

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,920
Daddy, what are you doing here?

48
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,480
You idiot! How long will
you keep going to discos?

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,480
What? No, Dad. It's
you who goes there.

50
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,400
You lazy fellow. It's
nine in the morning.

51
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
Are you planning to get up or not?
Useless fellow.

52
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,240
You do nothing except eat,
drink and play cricket.

53
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,240
You must study also.
Come on, get out of bed.

54
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,080
Good morning, Brother.

55
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,120
You've become such a big
Computer Engineer in Mumbai.

56
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,800
Because of daddy's fear your prayers
and worship are still going on!

57
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,160
After finishing your prayers,
write the letter. See you.

58
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,160
Okay, bye.. - Bye!

59
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,120
Greetings, Mom.
- Finally, you are up!

60
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Yes. - Hail Lord Shiva.

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm already ready to go.

62
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
What's going on in the house?

63
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,880
Everyone is chanting
Lord Shiva's name.

64
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,640
Idiot. Today is 'Shivratri'.

65
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,480
You should also apply
vermilion on your forehead.

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,720
Mother, you know I
don't like all this.

67
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Aren't you scared
of your father?

68
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,360
Mother, he is your husband. You can
be scared, but why should I be?

69
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
You are not scared, that's why
you get a firing every day.

70
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,400
Mummy, I'm bored hearing
him shouting everyday

71
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,480
but how is it that he's not
bored of firing me every day!

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,320
Son, he scolds you for your good.
That is because he loves you.

73
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
He loves me! Has he ever
even caressed me lovingly.

74
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,400
Son, you change
yourself and then see!

75
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,640
Mummy, if there is anyone
who needs to be changed

76
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
I would change daddy
straight away.

77
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,920
What did you say?
- What did he say?

78
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,400
It's nothing, Daddy. I was telling
her that it's 'Shivratri'

79
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,120
and why hasn't she put
vermilion on my forehead.

80
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,440
Good. Very good, dear.

81
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,520
Mother, one should genuinely want to
pray, and not be forced to do so.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,680
What's with the sound
coming from uncle's room?

83
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Uncle, what's this? You too are
praying for fear of daddy!

84
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,240
It's not that, my dear.

85
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,840
Actually your father is a
very good and religious man.

86
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,880
He looks upon me not
only as an elder brother

87
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
but he looks upon
me as God Father.

88
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,240
To make him happy, I worship.

89
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,040
Besides I worship because I
have a personal desire too.

90
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Greed. - I want you to get a

91
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,800
very good and beautiful wife.

92
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,400
Uncle, just last night a
lot of girls had come.

93
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,240
Where? - At home..

94
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,800
Why didn't you tell me?

95
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,320
They came in my dreams. You
were also in the dream.

96
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
What was I doing there?

97
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,000
Then daddy came, he slapped me.
My eyes opened and I got up.

98
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,240
Your daddy doesn't leave you
alone even in your dreams!

99
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,880
Uncle, why does he always chase
me like the God of Death?

100
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
You mustn't talk in this
manner about your father!

101
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,760
Your father is like a coconut.

102
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,240
Hard from outside, but
soft from within.

103
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,040
Do you know why have these
prayers been arranged today?

104
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,440
I know. It's 'Shivratri' today.

105
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,800
Not only that, you are getting
a new motorbike today!

106
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,280
What! What did you say?

107
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,280
Look through the window.
It's standing down.

108
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
Thank you, Dad. Thank
you very much.

109
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,440
For what?
- For giving me a motorcycle.

110
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,120
Before expecting a motorcycle

111
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,400
have you ever thought whether
you deserve it or not?

112
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,640
Your elder brother got 85 percent
to become a computer engineer

113
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,440
and even then I didn't buy
him an ordinary bicycle.

114
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,040
Your sister got 95 percent
marks in her pre-medical.

115
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,080
Even then I didn't
buy her a watch.

116
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,680
While you've just managed to
pass with 36 percent marks.

117
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,440
You are dreaming
about a motorcycle!

118
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,800
You are not even fit for a D.T.C.
bus. Go away.

119
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,800
I have purchased it to buy
things for the house!

120
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,840
Krishna, give me the
keys of the motorcycle.

121
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,120
Brother..
- Come on, give the key.

122
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,000
Brother, please do not mind, but
it's you, who has spoilt Karan.

123
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,320
Your darling nephew has just managed
to pass with 36 percent marks.

124
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,840
He has passed, isn't it?

125
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,240
Think of it like this! He
is progressing in life.

126
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,120
Progress?

127
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,080
Of course! Last year,
he had got 35 percent

128
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
and this year 36 percent.
He has improved, hasn't he?

129
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,400
You won't get it. Sushma,
get lassi for him.

130
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,920
Karan, my son, wait. Karan!

131
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,280
Karan, take the keys
of the motorcycle!

132
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,360
I don't want them.

133
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,440
Listen, the motorcycle
is for you.

134
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,120
I don't want anything!
- Listen to me..

135
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
Uncle, one day I will leave
this house and go away.

136
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,640
You are feeling bad because
of what your father said.

137
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,560
He's living in such a society.
Let him do what he wants.

138
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,560
We are of a different class.

139
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,120
You see, this motorcycle has not
been purchased by your father.

140
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,400
I have purchased it for you,
from my personal provident fund.

141
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,480
Really?
- Yes. I wanted him to give it.

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,720
So that the miser does
not feel embarrassed.

143
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,120
It seems his luck is not too good.
But my luck is very good!

144
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,800
Here are the keys.

145
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,800
Thank you, Uncle.. Thanks a lot.

146
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,360
Good morning, Karan.
- Good morning, sir.

147
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
Won't you congratulate me, sir?

148
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,560
What for? For the garland?

149
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,000
No, sir. Look under it.
- Oh. You've bought a new handle.

150
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,000
No, sir. Not that.

151
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, you've bought a new bike.

152
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,600
Congratulations. Well to
celebrate this, look behind

153
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,280
and there is your
nice little college.

154
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
So, my dear, why not
attend a class today.

155
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,080
Don't worry, sir.
Before you retire

156
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,760
I will definitely fulfil this
wish of yours. Let's go.

157
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,440
Listen, if you want, I can get
your class shifted to the canteen.

158
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,000
No, sir, don't do this, or we'll
have to shift the canteen.

159
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,440
Go, sir. The empty classroom
must be waiting for you.

160
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,600
If you don't pay up this month,
I'll not spare you. - Relax, man.

161
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,920
"Shoot me in the head..
My head is spinning.."

162
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,600
What song are you rehearsing for?
The function's song is different.

163
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,000
You are worried about the rehearsal.
Our lives are at stake here.

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,600
Why? What happened? Do you know Ayesha?
- Who?

165
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,920
Encounter specialist Inspector
Bhende's daughter. - So?

166
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,840
Hrithik has written a love letter to her.
- So what? - So what?

167
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,000
Her father has shot many
people during an encounter.

168
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,080
He must be searching for
Hrithik, and us to kill us.

169
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,440
That's why we are singing
this particular song.

170
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,840
Sing with love, my friends.

171
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,280
"Shoot me in the head."
- But where is Hrithik?

172
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,280
I am sitting here behind
the drum and he's sitting

173
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,760
there behind the drum.
"Shoot me in the head!"

174
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,640
Come on, my son.
- Where? - There.

175
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,240
He is Hrithik, but is not at
all smart from any angle.

176
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,880
Listen, why did you do this?
- Actually, she used to stare at me.

177
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,440
One stares at a
circus joker too.

178
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,160
Your mother named you Hrithik,
so you took your name seriously.

179
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,440
And wrote a love letter!

180
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,400
Your friendship will get
us also into trouble.

181
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,120
Look, he's so tense,
he's exercising.

182
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Why? - So that I can run.

183
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,560
If they come to beat me, I'll
take their side and tell you..

184
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,400
How dare you write a love
letter to my sister!

185
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,560
Beat him up..

186
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,720
Stop it. What are you doing?

187
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,640
He's fallen in love,
not committed a crime.

188
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
He's already frightened
and on top of

189
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,880
that you are scaring
him even further.

190
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,720
Don't daughters of police
inspector fall in love?

191
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,640
Of course they fall in love.

192
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,240
I read in the library
that more than two lakh

193
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,640
police inspectors daughters,
have fallen in love.

194
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,440
What a data you've collected!

195
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,120
Come on. Hide. Run..

196
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,560
Move, she's my girlfriend.
- Let me have a look.

197
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,320
My darling is waking all alone.

198
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,640
My dear, what a
decision you've taken.

199
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,040
Look at her face
and look at yours.

200
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,640
What's wrong with my face? My
mother says I am one in a lakh!

201
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,640
You are right. No one else
can even look like you!

202
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,760
Hey! A letter. A love letter.

203
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,760
Go now. Go. Come on.
- Are you sure?

204
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Hey, I got the love letter.

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,160
Bahadur, send something cold
to drink, and sandwiches too.

206
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Read it..

207
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,760
Should I read it?
- Come on, read.

208
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,160
Why are your hands shivering?

209
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,080
Well it's the first love
letter of my life, that's why!

210
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,080
What is there to feel scared?
Come on, read.

211
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,240
Call for a van from
the mental hospital.

212
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,880
My dear Hrithik.

213
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,400
What's happened to you? Are
there springs in the letter?

214
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,080
Have you ever seen your
face in the mirror?

215
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,480
On top of that you are writing
a love letter in English.

216
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,160
So many spelling mistakes.

217
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,760
Who advised you to
write this letter?

218
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,760
Give him a kick from my side.

219
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,840
Why are you kicking him?
- It's written in this letter.

220
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,720
Had someone else
written this letter

221
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,240
I would have complained to daddy
and got him sent to prison.

222
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,040
But after reading that
your name was Hrithik

223
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,640
I was so relieved.

224
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,640
After that I began to love you.
I love you, Hrithik.

225
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,600
"The heart seeks for love.."

226
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,600
"The heart seeks for love.."

227
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,840
"The heart seeks for love.."

228
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,440
"The heart seeks for love.."

229
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,840
"Life is too short..
You are my princess.."

230
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,760
"Life is too short..
You are my princess.."

231
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,760
"I wish to find the
love of my life.."

232
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:16,080
"The heart seeks for love.."

233
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,080
"The heart seeks for love.."

234
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,640
"We go crazy in one day.. Be
it the college or canteen."

235
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:22,080
"We go crazy in one day.. Be
it the college or canteen."

236
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,080
"We see our lover everywhere.
He is lost in his own dreams.."

237
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,840
"He is ready to die for love."

238
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,320
"The heart seeks for love.."

239
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,320
"The heart seeks for love.."

240
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,400
"When the world is asleep,
he is awake and lonely."

241
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,400
"He runs behind unknown faces."

242
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,080
"When the world is asleep,
he is awake and lonely."

243
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,920
"He runs behind unknown faces."

244
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,920
"His heart beats
only for love.."

245
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,920
"He does crazy stuff.
He is a mad guy."

246
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,840
"God knows where and
whom he shall propose."

247
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,360
"The heart seeks for love.."

248
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,360
"The heart seeks for love.."

249
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,560
Hi, Karan. - You!

250
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,840
Where have you come from?
- Let's go, I'll tell you later.

251
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,600
Get off, get off..
- Please, I'm getting late.

252
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,040
Shall I jump the signal
because of your haste?

253
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,040
The signal is clear. Let's go.

254
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,720
You are so foolish. You
can't even ride a bike.

255
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,720
You are so slow. Please
hurry, I'm getting late.

256
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,840
First you insist on coming. On
top of that you start ordering.

257
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,720
If you are in a rush get a rickshaw.
I will only drive at this speed.

258
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,080
Please, Karan, I'm already late.

259
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,120
Even I am getting late. Where to?
- Keep quiet. - You are irritating!

260
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,880
Hey, you are so late.
- I am so sorry.

261
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,160
Sorry, I couldn't find a rickshaw.
- So she found me.

262
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,280
Priya, who is this?

263
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,320
Karan, my sweet, innocent
foolish brother.

264
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,920
Hi, Karan. - Hi.

265
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
Karan, go home straight,
I'll reach in the evening..

266
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,520
Okay? - Straight home?

267
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,520
Straight home! Come
home, I'll show you..

268
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,560
Greetings, Uncle. I
said, greetings.

269
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,320
Hey.. Hello, Mom.

270
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,640
No one is ready to talk
properly to me in this house.

271
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,680
What is the matter
with you people?

272
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,560
What is it? Nothing
has happened.

273
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,240
Fine, what am I in this house.
I'm leaving.

274
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,320
Did you hear me, I'm going
back to the hostel..

275
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,480
I've heard it.. I 'm not deaf.

276
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,440
You said you'd come last
week and you are coming now.

277
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,880
For such a small thing all
your moods are spoilt.

278
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,640
You call this a small thing? Because
of your insistence that your

279
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,240
studies should not suffer we
let you go to the hostel.

280
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,240
Now the hostel is everything for you.
The home and we are nothing to you.

281
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,120
Mother, if I stay in this
house, uncle and Karan will

282
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,560
play games with me all
night and my studies

283
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,480
will be ruined.
- Yes, that is so.

284
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,120
Mother, your daughter
wants to become a doctor

285
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,240
and studying for
that is not easy.

286
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
I know, you are going
to become a doctor

287
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,360
but when you don't come
home we all get upset.

288
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,800
That's why I am here. Mom.

289
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,720
Mom! - What?
- Two grey hair. Why don't you dye it?

290
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,400
Go and have a bath. I'm
cooking okra for you.

291
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,560
"What are you doing
in my patio?"

292
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,400
Greetings, sir.

293
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,000
Bless you. Tell me, have you
got a girl friend or not yet!

294
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,400
I did find one

295
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,680
but she is a flirt, you know.

296
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,240
You fool, feed the birds
with seeds of love

297
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,440
then see how many birds
come and perch there.

298
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,120
You are really getting romantic today.
- What did you say?

299
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,000
Nothing at all, I was
asking where Karan is.

300
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,720
Hey. - Greetings, ma'am.
- Bless you, son.

301
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,000
Have you come to meet Karan?
Is there any special plan?

302
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,560
Yes, ma'am, I've come to study.

303
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,880
Good, you take so much interest
in studies and look at Karan.

304
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,440
He's forever getting yelled at
from his father. Explain to him.

305
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,000
I keep telling him but he
just doesn't listen to me.

306
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,440
If I tell him something, he teases
me by calling me a bookworm.

307
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,640
As for my studies

308
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,240
I am at them twenty-four hours.

309
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,880
If the power goes off, I study
under the street lights.

310
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,800
Very good. Very good.

311
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Excellent, son. Fortunate
are the parents

312
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,640
who gave birth to
a son like you.

313
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,640
Ma'am, I am like a
blessing to them from God.

314
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,320
You! - Run!
- Where are you going?

315
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,280
He's Karan's friend and
has come to study.

316
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,560
Study! Have you
ever seen a book?

317
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,640
He stands in front of our
college and stares at girls.

318
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,720
Even after their scolding he
stands there shamelessly.

319
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Very good..

320
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
Since he is Karan's friend I
have to suffer this humiliation.

321
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,400
What are you saying?

322
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,640
She's joking, sir..

323
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,320
Joke? Day before
yesterday a young

324
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
girl was beating you
with her slippers.

325
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,640
Oh! Well I've already tied up with her.
- What?

326
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
See, Mom. Hasn't he accepted?

327
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,040
How will my brother
reform in such company?

328
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,040
Don't dare to come here again!
- Understand? - Yes.

329
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,320
How was your journey?
- Well. The train was late. Stop.

330
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,640
Hi, Karan. Hello, sir.
- You? - Where were you?

331
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
I had gone to pick my brother up.
Why? What Happened?

332
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,320
Cheeku tried to commit suicide.
- What are you saying? Where is he?

333
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,080
Nothing has happened to him. Let's
go to his house. - Come on.

334
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,640
Keep calm now. With
God's blessings

335
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,000
your son's life has been saved.

336
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,920
What happened to Cheeku?

337
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,400
What shall I say, son?

338
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,280
He failed in one
subject and felt so

339
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,600
dejected that he tried
to commit suicide.

340
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,800
What's happened to you, Cheeku?
I saw your mark sheet.

341
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,440
You got forty percent in maths.
36 in English, 38 in Hindi.

342
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Then which subject
have you failed in?

343
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,040
In love. - What do you mean?

344
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,640
Pinky's father wants her
to get married elsewhere.

345
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I thought that if
Pinky can't be mine

346
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,440
then what's the point
of living, Karan..

347
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,040
That's why I did this.
- But ma'am said something else.

348
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,640
If he had told his
mother the truth

349
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,640
he wouldn't have had
to commit suicide.

350
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
His mother herself would
have strangled him.

351
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Do something, Karan..

352
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,440
Don't you worry.
You two will marry

353
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,440
and it's my responsibility
to get the girl.

354
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,760
Oh, God. - Where are you going?

355
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,000
Where are you going on the
bike at this late hour?

356
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,680
Daddy will wake up..
- But where are you going?

357
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,800
It's Cheeku's birthday party today.
All his friends are coming. - So?

358
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,720
If the friends are coming then the
girlfriend must also come, isn't it.

359
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,720
So, I am going to get her.
- Forcibly?

360
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,400
Yes, her parents are
not allowing her.

361
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,560
It means you are going to kidnap her?
- You are right.

362
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,720
Have you gone mad?
- Daddy will get up.

363
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,400
As it is daddy remains
upset with you.

364
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,120
If you misbehave,
he'll get more upset.

365
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,240
That's his daily routine.
- I won't let you go.

366
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
Priya, understand.
Cheeku needs my help.

367
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
To hell with Cheeku.
I won't let you go.

368
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,440
What is this argument about?

369
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,040
Now uncle too is awake. He's coming here.
Now you just cannot go.

370
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,720
Where are you going
at this time?

371
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,560
First send this problem inside.
- Come on, you problem, go inside.

372
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,040
But Uncle..
- Go inside. I'll handle him. Tell.

373
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,760
Come closer.. I'm kidnapping
a girl for my friend.

374
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,880
You are doing a great thing.

375
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,560
And there's another news.
- What?

376
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,560
I have taken five thousand rupees
from your cupboard for this. - Good.

377
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,120
Oh, this girl is in a burka? I
cannot perform this marriage.

378
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,280
Don't worry. She is a Hindu.
Her name is Pinky.

379
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,160
Her father's name is
Brij Mohan Sharma.

380
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,600
Yes, if you don't
believe see my ID card.

381
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,280
Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine but

382
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,920
Cheeku hasn't come yet.
- Cheeku hasn't come yet?

383
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,920
What will happen now, Karan?
- Don't worry.

384
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,920
He said he will reach on time.
- Where are Darshan and Hrithik?

385
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,360
They have gone to
arrange for the police.

386
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,600
We are the ones at fault and we
are calling the police as well?

387
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,600
I think they are here.

388
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,520
Father..

389
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,840
Please don't create
any trouble, sir.

390
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,360
We are politicians, son. We haven't
come here to create trouble.

391
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,440
Thank you. You mean you are
ready for this marriage?

392
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,600
If you were going
to agree so easily

393
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,680
I jumped your boundary
wall needlessly.

394
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,520
I climbed on the pipe by tying
this sari, and brought Pinky down.

395
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
We arranged for the burka too.

396
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,080
That's all fine but
where is the groom?

397
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,080
He must be coming, sir.
- Is it? He is already here.

398
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,280
Go ask him if he is ready
for the marriage or not.

399
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,360
Marriage? Sir, he's even
ready for the honeymoon.

400
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,760
What are you doing here, Cheeku?

401
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,840
Come, take the circumambulations
and your in-laws' blessings.

402
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,160
I don't know what you are
talking about, Karan.

403
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,760
What happened? Is
there a problem?

404
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,360
I was the one who lost my head.

405
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,440
I thought you might not reach with
Pinky, so I reached there myself.

406
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,760
The minister's guard
caught me and beat me up

407
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
so badly that I can't
even tell you.

408
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,080
What am I to tell
you, my friend.

409
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,800
Is that so? You sit here.
I'll go deal with him.

410
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,280
You turned out to be
very crooked, sir.

411
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,000
After all you are a politician.
You are using your dirty tricks

412
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,320
on your daughter's love also.
- Keep quiet.

413
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
That shorty will
become my son-in-law?

414
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,400
He is no less than a joker.

415
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,400
Let's go. - No, Dad..
- Don't do this. Please.

416
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,000
You idiot. Moron. Why don't
you go kill yourself?

417
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,640
Why are you after my life?

418
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,120
Did I get you a bike so that
you could kidnap girls?

419
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,040
He is the only one in our family
who has been to a police station.

420
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,080
You went to the jail.
You should be ashamed.

421
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,400
Krishna, why are you
parading him even on Diwali?

422
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,720
What will the neighbours
think when they hear?

423
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,120
Let them hear. Let everyone hear.
Only then will he come to his senses.

424
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,400
Go to your room, son.

425
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,840
Go help your mother, Priya.

426
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,880
And you, are you sitting
here to eat sweets?

427
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,640
Go out and see if there are lights outside.
- Okay.

428
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,240
Krishna, many big politicians
have been in the lock-up

429
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,400
and our son had gone
inside not because of

430
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,440
any misdeed but because
of good deeds.

431
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,440
Is it a good deed to
abduct someone's daughter?

432
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,440
Who has told you that he had
abducted someone's daughter?

433
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,160
He has brought
together two lovers.

434
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,560
He has done a great deed.

435
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,640
In fact I feel very proud of him.
- This is the result of

436
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,640
you giving him freedom. He is
getting more spoilt each day.

437
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,560
So you think all this is
happening because of me? - Yes.

438
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,520
That's fine. On this day Ramchandra
had returned to Ayodhya.

439
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,280
I will leave this
house today and go.

440
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,240
Brother, you are
unnecessarily upset.

441
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,400
You are saying
things to upset me.

442
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,440
Now why are you staring at me?

443
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,280
Go and prepare for the veneration.
- I am going.. - Go!

444
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,400
Subedar Balram Singh,
you are too good.

445
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,400
Last night I'd told you not to
go out, but you wouldn't listen.

446
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,320
You said Cheeku needed your help.
Now go and help him.

447
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,000
God knows, till when you'll be
involved with such friends.

448
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,640
Daddy will keep scolding you, and
uncle will keep on protecting you.

449
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,040
Hey, rickshaw! Stop! Come
on, change your mood now.

450
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,000
Come on. - You go. I'll come later.
- But where will you go now?

451
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,400
The prayers are going to start.

452
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,800
I'll say my prayers later on. You go now.
- Let's go.

453
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,800
I said, go!
- All right. I'll go. Why are you shouting?

454
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,080
Come on, kids. Let's go.
Come on, get inside the car.

455
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,040
Why are you sitting so quietly in the
middle of the road, like a fool.

456
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,440
Nothing. - My bike has run
out of fuel because of you.

457
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,440
Idiot. Why do you feel
bad at what daddy said?

458
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Let's go. Everyone's waiting for
you at home. Hop on. Hurry!

459
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,520
Hurry up. I wonder what
you were doing here..

460
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,560
The auspicious time was at 9:40 p.m.
Just ten minutes left. Oh, God.

461
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,560
Dad is already angry. God
knows how he will react.

462
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,040
"Ever since I saw you.."

463
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,120
"I haven't seen that moon."

464
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,840
"Ever since I saw you.."

465
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,640
"I haven't seen that moon."

466
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:33,400
"I have lost my heart..
I am wandering."

467
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,360
"I have lost my heart..
I am wandering."

468
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:44,800
"That's how much you
have made me crazy.."

469
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,800
"Ever since I saw you.. I
haven't seen that moon."

470
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,560
"When the cool breeze"

471
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:51,240
"blows on my face..
I feel as if.."

472
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,880
"You are nearby."

473
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:02,320
"What magic have you done?"

474
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:10,480
"That I have become so crazy."

475
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,920
"The sky is bowing down..
Time has stopped.."

476
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,920
"My heart beats only for you."

477
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,800
"Ever since I saw you.."

478
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,800
"I haven't seen that moon."

479
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,920
"I see you in the garden
and on the streets.."

480
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:37,440
"I see you on the roads
and crossings.."

481
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,760
"Sometimes I see you in strangers,
sometimes in dear ones."

482
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:52,920
"I see you in my
dreams as well.."

483
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,680
"I look for you everywhere.."

484
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,680
"I wish I find you very soon."

485
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,440
"Ever since I saw you.. I
haven't seen that moon."

486
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,920
What happened to you? We
were going to win the match!

487
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,840
We couldn't win the match,
but instead made enemies.

488
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,760
At the most they will think that
you threw the ball on purpose.

489
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,840
What on earth where you
thinking at that time?

490
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:48,480
Dabboo, stop the car. I say, stop.
- Why? What's wrong now?

491
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,600
What's happened to you?
- Leave me alone.

492
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,600
But.. - Let's go.

493
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,280
Who are you?

494
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,560
Excuse me, this pouch
of yours fell down.

495
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,560
Oh, my God. It had my tickets
and credit card. Thank you.

496
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,880
It's all right. - Excuse me.

497
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,000
Yes. Ma'am, I don't want a tip.

498
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,320
I am not giving a tip.

499
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,640
I want your autograph.
- My autograph?

500
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Ma'am, I am not a hero that
you need my autograph.

501
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,640
According to me, every person
who does a good job is a hero.

502
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,640
You've done good work. Autograph please.
- Okay.

503
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,880
Pooja, where were you? We've
been waiting for you.

504
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,320
Why so late? - Sorry, I got late.
- Pooja, without you

505
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,000
there's no fun in the party.
- Sorry.

506
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,800
From the last one hour, everyone is
wanting to know the whereabouts of

507
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,560
the girl, for whom
this party is held.

508
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,000
My dear, I enquired the most.
- Do you recognise him?

509
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,400
Mr. Chandrabhavan! From Shimla?
- Good. You recognised him at once.

510
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,320
How can I not recognise you?
Papa always talks about you.

511
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,640
You were his college friend.
Even in the family album

512
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,400
your photographs, right
from childhood are there.

513
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,440
Papa remembers you a lot uncle.
- Yes, my dear.

514
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,640
Raj Saxena was a very good friend of mine.
He was a great scholar.

515
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,640
When I heard about your mummy and
papa's death in a plane crash

516
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,720
I felt very sad. I've
lost a wonderful friend.

517
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,320
After marriage, this
is what happens.

518
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,400
Yesterday I went to my
girlfriend's house.

519
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Her mother welcomed me nicely.
In the meantime the scrap

520
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,040
dealer called, and wanted to
know, whether there was any

521
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,240
old stuff in the house. She
told him that there was

522
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,640
old stuff lying in the house

523
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,720
but right now he has
gone to the office!

524
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
You are fooling around here.
Have you seen Karan?

525
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,440
Let him be now. These days he is
lost in his own strange world.

526
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,240
At least try to find out
where exactly is he lost?

527
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,640
All right, ma'am..

528
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,280
Let's go. - Karan. - Come on..

529
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,720
Hey, Karan.

530
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,080
Karan, why are you
behaving like this?

531
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,000
Is there any problem? Did
someone tell you anything?

532
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,000
I don't know. I just cannot
concentrate these days.

533
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,000
What has happened to him?

534
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,240
Guys, it's of no use. It
won't kill any mosquito.

535
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,840
Why? - These days there
is so much pollution

536
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,520
that even the mosquitoes are
moving around with gas masks!

537
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,520
That was lame.

538
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,920
Hey, stop!

539
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,520
Stop please! I say, stop please!

540
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,040
What's wrong? Where
is he running?

541
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,400
What happened to him now?

542
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,600
Karan, where are you going?
- What's happened?

543
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,720
Tell us what's the matter?

544
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,080
Tell us where are you going?
- She'll go away.

545
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,000
Who? - She..

546
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,640
"He's not suffering from a cold.."
- Karan.

547
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,480
"Or a cough but he's
fallen in love."

548
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,560
"Fallen in love." - Take this..

549
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,000
Congratulations, friends.

550
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,720
From now on, we are all
sailing in the same boat.

551
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,800
Till now only Karan
was not involved

552
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,560
but now he too is madly in
love with that pretty girl.

553
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,000
It's not what you
guys are thinking.

554
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,400
I want to talk to
that girl just once

555
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,680
and ask her who she is.

556
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,920
'What is your name? What is
your relationship with me?'

557
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,400
Why is that I can't stop thinking
about you, even for a moment?

558
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,560
Why have you stolen my sleep?

559
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,120
Karan, my dear friend. You
are so obsessed in her love.

560
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,120
Am I right? Tell me..

561
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,680
Tell me what is her category?
- Category?

562
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,440
Cheeku, the time has
come for you to give him

563
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,840
a lecture about the categories of
girls and their general knowledge.

564
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,920
Students, in our campus, there are
7 girls college, 6 Junior Colleges

565
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,120
and 14 co-educational colleges.

566
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,680
In all these colleges
14,810 girls study.

567
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,040
They all come under
different categories

568
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,040
and I will teach him
about all this.

569
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,440
First category is 'A', that
is the Deluxe category.

570
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,840
I have no words to praise girls
who fall in this category.

571
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,800
There are 2,800 girls
in this category.

572
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,840
The second category is 'B' and
in this there are 3,445 girls.

573
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,440
It's because of them that all
beauty and cosmetic parlours run.

574
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,800
If they were not around
all the beauty parlours

575
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,120
would have shut down.

576
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,560
Because of them lipsticks,
powder and cosmetics are sold.

577
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,560
The third category
is the 'C' category.

578
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,160
They don't look that great
or happening, you know.

579
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,800
In this there are maximum number
of girls, that is, 4,445.

580
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,560
No matter which girl you look at

581
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,640
they won't look
like girls to you.

582
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,440
Thank you, Professor
Shankar Mahadevan.

583
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,880
Don't be breathless.

584
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,800
Now tell us which is your category?
- A class.

585
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,840
He is doomed.

586
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,920
I belong to the 'C' category.

587
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Chasing a girl from this
category, I lost half my hair.

588
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,560
You are chasing a girl
from the 'A' category?

589
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,120
I don't know what you will lose.

590
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,120
I have to meet that girl
under any circumstances.

591
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,440
My friend, you don't know
her name nor her address.

592
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,440
How exactly will your find her?

593
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,720
Hail Lord Shiva..

594
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,000
Here, Mom..
- You also come along, son.

595
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,120
Mother, you carry on.
What will I do there?

596
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,320
You shouldn't say so, son. If
you pray with all your heart

597
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,800
your wish will be granted.

598
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,640
I won't find her in
the temple, will I?

599
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,120
What? - No, it's nothing.

600
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,440
Come on, or else, your
father will scold you.

601
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,560
That is his daily routine.
Please go.

602
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,600
The veneration is
about to start.

603
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:30,080
"You came closer and smiled.."

604
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,080
Where has this Pooja gone?

605
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,320
Excuse me.

606
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,040
Your name is Karan, right?
- Yes.

607
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,160
Someone is calling you.
- Karan..

608
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,040
Karan, you are sitting here. Your
papa has been looking for you.

609
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,440
Come on, it's time for
the prayers to begin.

610
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,320
Mother, you were
right when you said

611
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,160
that one can get
everything by prayers.

612
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,560
Thanks for bringing
me here, Mom.

613
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,560
Karan, where are you going?

614
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,440
Pooja, where did you go away?

615
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,440
Sorry. It's such a beautiful temple.
I got so many photos.

616
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,880
Come on, it's very late already.
Come on, let's go.

617
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,880
Come on.

618
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,320
Look at him.

619
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,480
You idiot. Even in the temple,
you are up to tricks.

620
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,440
What's over there?

621
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,080
Dad..
- Come on, say your prayers.

622
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,080
Stupid.

623
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,640
Manu, can you drop me?

624
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,880
I have an important interview.

625
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,800
Why! Has your father filled the petrol?
Go by bus.

626
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,000
The interview time is twelve
and it's already twelve.

627
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,000
Why are you crying? Don't worry.
Your work will be done.

628
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,120
Here comes that innocent angel.

629
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,480
Hi, Karan. - Hi.

630
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,400
What's it? These days you are
being talked about everywhere?

631
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,640
Why? - I've heard, that you are
looking for some girl. Found her?

632
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,080
No, man. - Had you gone there?
- What's there?

633
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,040
Actually every Saturday
there's a jam session.

634
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,840
Specially for girls. All the girls
go there. Go and try there.

635
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,840
Where is this building?
- In Friend's colony.

636
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,840
Wait. He is going there.
Drop him please.

637
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,280
Sure. - Go on now..

638
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:31,120
I made a fool of that idiot.

639
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,800
Listen, my interview
is scheduled here.

640
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,000
Just wait, I'll come
in half an hour.

641
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,800
Then I'll come along with you and
search for that girl of yours!

642
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,040
Listen, Sharma. Come here.

643
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,720
If you had told me frankly

644
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,800
that you had an
interview lined up here

645
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,320
do you think I wouldn't
have dropped you?

646
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,560
I'm sorry, buddy.
- You fool. It's all right this time.

647
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,000
In future if you try to fool with
me, I'll really set you right.

648
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,000
Go now and best of luck.
- Thank you.

649
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,320
I think she has gone upstairs.

650
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,120
"Oh, my darling.."

651
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,880
"My crazy heart is
looking for you."

652
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,720
"It's really difficult to"

653
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,720
"hide my feelings now."

654
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,000
"Oh, my darling.."

655
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,760
"My crazy heart is
looking for you."

656
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:07,440
"It's really difficult to
hide my feelings now."

657
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:18,000
"I kept quiet for so
long but not anymore."

658
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:25,680
"I want to say something.."

659
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:32,840
"I want to say something.."

660
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,840
"I want to say something.."

661
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:49,720
"Seasons kept changing and
my heart was yearning.."

662
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:57,280
"I was so engrossed
in your thoughts.."

663
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:05,000
"Seasons kept changing and
my heart was yearning.."

664
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:12,080
"I was so engrossed
in your thoughts.."

665
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,880
"I don't want to be away"

666
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,560
"from you anymore.."

667
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:30,160
"I want to say something.."

668
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:37,760
"I want to say something.."

669
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,760
"I want to say something.."

670
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:25,560
"I might cross my limits..
I might just stop here."

671
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:33,120
"I don't want to die
yearning for you.."

672
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:40,920
"I might cross my limits..
I might just stop here."

673
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:48,520
"I don't want to die
yearning for you.."

674
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,440
"I want to lay down"

675
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:59,000
"my life for you.."

676
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:06,760
"I want to say something.."

677
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,440
"I want to say something.."

678
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,440
"I want to say something.."

679
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,920
So. You saw that girl
and lost your sleep

680
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,600
and peace of mind.. Etcetera..

681
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,760
I think you've fallen
in love with her!

682
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,400
Right? - Right.

683
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,000
From which film is this scene?

684
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,840
Film scene? It's
the truth, Priya.

685
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,160
My dear sweet innocent
foolish brother.

686
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,120
You think that this
is love but it's not.

687
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,520
It's just attraction.
Only attraction.

688
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,160
Attraction? - Obviously.

689
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,080
Only attraction?
- Of course! What else?

690
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,160
Let's go, Priya.
- Where are you going?

691
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,280
Just wait here.

692
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,760
Priya. From the time
I've seen that girl

693
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,280
I have no control
over my emotions.

694
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,600
I feel as if I have been robbed.

695
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,080
In my sleep, I stay
awake and I don't

696
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,640
know in which world
I just get lost.

697
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,040
And here you are saying
that it's attraction.

698
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:32,080
Karan.

699
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,920
Priya, I had thought that

700
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,920
you were the only one who
would understand me.

701
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,360
If I confess all this to you maybe
my heart will become lighter.

702
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,000
But.. - Karan, I'm sorry.

703
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,440
I misunderstood your feelings.
Don't worry, I am with you.

704
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,320
What is that girl's name?
- I don't know.

705
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,240
Good.. Where does she stay?
- I don't know.

706
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,120
Very good.. Her mom, dad..
- I don't know.

707
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,480
Superb, excellent. If you
know so much about her..

708
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,120
I mean you don't know
anything about her

709
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,800
then this confirms that
you really love her.

710
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,440
Thank you.
- What's there to thank me?

711
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,680
I was doing my duty as a sister.

712
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,320
Whatever her name is

713
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,320
now she is going to be
my future sister-in-law.

714
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,320
Excuse me!

715
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,480
Listen!

716
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,480
Hello!

717
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,480
Hello..

718
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,880
Excuse me!

719
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,880
Listen!

720
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,760
I must take his autograph.

721
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,120
Excuse me, sir. Please call him.
- Yes.

722
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,320
Excuse me. Call him.

723
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,000
Excuse me. Please call him.

724
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,320
Hello. Call him.

725
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,320
Sir, call him.

726
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Hi, Karan. - Hi, Priya.

727
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,080
Hi. - Priya. What
are you doing here?

728
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,120
Can you drop me to the hostel?

729
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,480
Sorry, we have a rehearsal just now.
Take a rickshaw.

730
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,240
Tell one of your
friends to drop me.

731
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,480
Come, I'll drop you.
- Just a minute.

732
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,800
Priya, you go by rickshaw everyday
then what's the problem today?

733
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,680
Actually, Karan.. I
didn't want to tell you

734
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,720
but on the way some
boys tease me.

735
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Come with me.

736
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,040
Karan, please.. Karan, stop.

737
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,000
Karan.
- Hop on. I'll take care of them.

738
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,000
Karan, stop it. Please,
Karan, stop it.

739
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,800
Oh, my!

740
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,400
They are the ones, right?
- Please, Karan, stop it.

741
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,040
Stop it, Karan.
They are dangerous.

742
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,000
Hey.. He got scared. Coward.

743
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,400
Hey! Who did you say this to?
What did you say?

744
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,400
Oh, my!

745
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,120
Take the name of the Lord.
- Hail to Him!

746
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,280
I will not spare you.

747
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,040
I will not spare you - Hey.

748
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,560
You are dead! - We are here.

749
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,560
Stop!
- Enough. Let us go from here.

750
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,320
You arrive when the fight is over!
- Dabbu! Stop it!

751
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,280
Come on. Come on, let us go now.
- Just stop it. - Come on. Come on.

752
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,080
Bhaskar, I am very worried
about my younger son, Karan.

753
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,240
What happened to Karan?

754
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,280
He does not concentrate
on his studies.

755
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,160
I want to send him
to Shimla, to you.

756
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,840
If he stays with you and
studies for a few months

757
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,000
then he may get better marks
in this year's exams.

758
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,280
Don't worry, send him immediately.
- Thank you, pal.

759
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,680
Priya, I don't understand why

760
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,440
you all are forcing me to
go when I don't want to?

761
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,080
Because if you stay here, neither
you nor your friends will study.

762
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,600
And dear, if you don't
come first this time

763
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,160
then neither I nor uncle
will be able to save you

764
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,080
from father's scolding.

765
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,080
Priya, why don't you understand

766
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,080
there are things, other than
studying, in this world.

767
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,280
I know what work you have! You
are thinking about that girl.

768
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,760
Don't worry. We will both look for
her after your exams are over.

769
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,440
That is fine, but what
if she falls in love

770
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,080
with someone else after I leave?

771
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,280
I will then have only
her name to chant.

772
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,680
You don't know, Priya, nowadays
the competition is so tough

773
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,680
that boys have to stand in
queues for a beautiful girl.

774
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,280
My dear, sweet, innocent,
foolish brother.

775
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,600
Girls don't love like that.

776
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,680
Look at me. Do you think I will
love anyone who comes my way?

777
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,680
Hey, I was talking about
beautiful girls, not you.

778
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:38,920
What! - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

779
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,360
Pooja, is there any emergency?

780
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,160
Why have you suddenly
decided to go to Shimla?

781
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,440
Uncle Chandra Mohan is a very
dear friend of father's.

782
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,760
He is not well.

783
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,440
I will stay with him for a few
days to give him company.

784
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,840
Karan. Karan. Karan.

785
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,080
Hey, Priya, this does
not have my name!

786
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,440
No reservation. Come,
let us go home.

787
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,520
Hey, mister, this
compartment is S-4.

788
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,880
And your reservation is in S-2.
Come, let us go there. Come on.

789
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,080
Why don't you leave?
- There is still time left.

790
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:05,600
Hey! - Yes.
- Hello! Hello! Excuse me.

791
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,000
Hello! - Oh, my God.
- Pooja. - Pooja.

792
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,000
Pooja, where are you going?
- Where are you going?

793
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,560
Come on. Come on, go in.

794
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,600
Hello..

795
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,800
Who was he, Pooja? Who was he?

796
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,720
The autograph guy?
- Yes. - Oh, no.

797
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:22,800
Come on. Come on.
- Come on, the train is about to leave.

798
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:23,800
Bye, Pooja. - Bye. - Bye.

799
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,800
Take care of yourself. Okay, Pooja?
- Bye, take care. Bye-bye. - Bye.

800
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,520
"Follow me by my trail and
watch before you come."

801
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,320
How long will it take, mister?

802
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,600
Only the car knows that. She is upset.
- Hurry up.

803
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,840
You are just singing songs.

804
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,760
Sir, the car belongs
to the mountains.

805
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,760
Only a song will make her work.

806
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,600
Mister, keep on singing. I
will hitch a ride to Shimla.

807
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,080
No, son.. Don't take a lift.

808
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,920
There are terrorists
in some vehicles.

809
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,360
They may kidnap a
rich boy like you.

810
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,680
I will not let you go.
I will take you, man.

811
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,600
Oh, God. I missed the
car because of you.

812
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,520
Father had to punish
me like this.

813
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,840
Even Priya did not listen to me.
She dumped me in these mountains.

814
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,320
I could have found that
girl had I stayed in Delhi.

815
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,320
Why is the car reversing?

816
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,440
Hi.

817
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,520
Hi! - Did your car break down?
Can I help you?

818
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,840
Well, I want to go to Shimla.
- All right, I will take you.

819
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,080
Driver. - Yes, ma'am.
- Help him.

820
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,520
I will drive the car.
- Okay, ma'am.

821
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Come. - Yes.

822
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,440
Okay, mister. See you later.
Bye-bye!

823
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,120
Great! He started speaking English
as soon as he saw a girl!

824
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:12,000
Hi, I am Pooja. - Karan.
- Nice to meet you.

825
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,520
Thank you for this great help.

826
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,840
Or else, I would have been
stuck in these mountains.

827
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,560
I have learnt from you

828
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,080
that one should always
help someone in trouble.

829
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,800
From me? - Yes.

830
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,440
You remember you saved a child from
falling off a bike in Chanakyapuri?

831
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:30,280
Yes. Now see how people unwittingly
lose their most precious things.

832
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,360
Like me. - Like you?

833
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,840
What else? I ran after you
to get your autograph.

834
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,600
But the traffic light
changed, and you left.

835
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,720
Then I saw you at
Nizamuddin station.

836
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,400
I called out to you. I
even ran towards the door.

837
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,720
But I saw that you
vanished again.

838
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,760
Karan, I think
your work is done.

839
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,800
And then, we met in a
temple before that.

840
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,000
Yes, in the temple. And
after that, in these hills.

841
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,360
Karan, you are so interesting.

842
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,720
Oh, God. - Oh, God!

843
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,840
Karan! - Pooja!

844
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:05,040
Pooja, brakes! Pooja!
Be careful, Pooja!

845
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,720
Pooja, brakes!

846
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:13,400
Oh, God!

847
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,400
Pooja, get out!

848
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,240
Hold me tight, Pooja.

849
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,760
Pooja, go!

850
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,000
Go, Pooja. Come on, Pooja, try.

851
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,000
Pooja, go up.

852
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,080
Pooja, try. Come on, Pooja.
Come on, Pooja.

853
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,600
Try, Pooja. Come on.

854
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,160
Try, Pooja, try!

855
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,000
Come on, Pooja! - Karan!

856
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,360
Karan!

857
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:13,160
Come on, Pooja. Come on.
Pooja! Pooja, try.

858
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,760
Come on, Pooja. - Karan!

859
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,400
Pooja, come on.

860
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,920
Karan.
- Pooja, hold me. Pooja, come on, try.

861
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,400
Pooja, come on. Pooja.
- Karan! - Pooja!

862
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:32,320
Karan!

863
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,240
Good evening, Mr. Singh.

864
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,560
How is my niece, doctor? Has
she regained consciousness?

865
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,400
Don't worry, she is all right.
- Yes?

866
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,400
Come. - Thank you.

867
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,720
Pooja.

868
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,720
Dear Pooja..

869
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:57,720
Karan!

870
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,720
Boss, what took you so long?

871
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,040
It is not easy to cut and
load sandalwood trees.

872
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,520
Come on and sit down quickly.

873
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,760
Hey, who is he?

874
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,280
He was hanging from a tree.

875
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,920
I think he must have
tried to commit suicide.

876
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,280
Is he dead or alive?
- He is still breathing.

877
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,280
We will drop him at a nearby hospital.
- Come on.

878
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,560
Uncle, any news of Karan?

879
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,000
All this happened because of me.

880
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:43,120
He was going his own way.
I gave him a lift.

881
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,000
Who was he, where does he stay..

882
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:50,640
How devastated his parents will
be when they come to know!

883
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,640
I feel very scared when I
think of all this, Uncle.

884
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,400
It will come.
- Chiku, did you find out?

885
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,000
We searched all the
bungalows in the city.

886
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,720
But we could not
find her anywhere.

887
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,440
Someone's father abused us
and shooed us away. - Yes.

888
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,560
Someone sent dogs at us.
- What else!

889
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,120
There is not a place left
where we have not looked.

890
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,040
I think she is not in this city.
- Yes.

891
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,040
Who says that the girl
is not in this city?

892
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,720
I do.
- You fools, nincompoops, donkeys!

893
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,640
If you all lose hope so easily

894
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:51,040
then I will use my slippers and
throw you all out of this house.

895
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:56,040
Karan, I have found
out about the girl.

896
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,400
What!
- Her name is Pooja, is it not?

897
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,720
I told you her name.

898
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,440
But you did not tell me that
she is from America. - No.

899
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,320
And you also did not tell me that
she is here doing a research

900
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,320
on Indian culture. - No.

901
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,640
And you did not tell
me that she is staying

902
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,000
with her uncle, Rana
Virendra Pratap Singh.

903
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,120
Then you must also
know her address.

904
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,880
No, son, that is the only
thing I could not find out.

905
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,320
Why? - Because they managed
to get our address!

906
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,320
What? - Yes!

907
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,840
Hi, Karan.

908
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,440
How are you feeling?
- Better. Much better.

909
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,000
A lot better now.

910
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,280
I am sorry, Karan. The truck
driver was driving so rash

911
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,760
so fast.. Suddenly
he came in the front

912
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,040
and I lost control of
the steering wheel.

913
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,160
I am sorry, Karan.

914
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,080
Son, I have no words with
which I can thank you.

915
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,400
You have done me a big
favour by saving her life.

916
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,720
Autograph, please.

917
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,000
Autograph? - Yes.

918
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,320
Whenever she meets a nice person

919
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,040
she takes their autograph
to remember them by.

920
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,880
Very good. Very good.

921
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,000
Even I will start this
habit from tomorrow.

922
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,240
But I will take autographs
of rude people.

923
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,640
Krishna. - Yes?

924
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,240
The first autograph
will be yours.

925
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:20,240
Brother, you are too much..

926
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,880
This one is for today. I need a
second autograph for the day

927
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,880
you saved that child's life.
- Oh.

928
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,520
Very good. Very good.
Boy, this is great!

929
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,280
The girl you were looking for
came here looking for you.

930
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,600
Now don't play this love
game like a test match.

931
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,600
Play it like a one-day match.
What are you thinking of?

932
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,840
Tell her in your next
meeting, I love you.

933
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,280
You fool, listening to
uncle will do you no good.

934
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,280
Has he ever romanced anyone in his
life that he is giving your ideas?

935
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,440
Then tell me what should I do?

936
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,160
Look, Karan, Pooja is a
smart and mature girl.

937
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,680
According to me you should
try to become her friend

938
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:09,840
before saying I love you.

939
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,520
Deepen your friendship first.

940
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,160
It may take time

941
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:17,000
but don't worry, when you get
closer to her heart as a friend

942
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,760
then that will be the right
time to say I love you.

943
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,160
Then she herself will
say, I love you, Karan!

944
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,840
Your sister is a doctor
not a philosopher.

945
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,840
She can cure just
colds and coughs.

946
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,520
You fool, do you know
what will happen

947
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,440
if you listen to your sister?

948
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,840
What will happen? - It will take
you six months to befriend her.

949
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,520
Another six to get close to her.

950
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,160
And when after six months
you will say I love you

951
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,600
she will say, I am getting
married in the next six months.

952
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,920
Hey, why are you all talking
rubbish and chewing his brains?

953
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,840
Priya is more intelligent
than all of us put together.

954
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,520
She will be correct, no
matter what she says.

955
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,680
Yes, he is right.
- Yes, Mr. Undecided.

956
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,680
So first friendship,
and then I love you.

957
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,840
But Dabbu, how will I know that
she also wants to be my friend?

958
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,760
Brother, if she has
any feelings for you

959
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,440
she will surely come
to your house today.

960
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:04,520
If she comes, then think that

961
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
she too has some feelings
for you, my dear.

962
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,000
And what if she does not?

963
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,760
If she does not, then she does
not feel anything, my friend.

964
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,440
Come on in. So, you finally
found time to come home.

965
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,840
Where were you?

966
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,920
Father, I had my
orchestra rehearsals.

967
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,280
Breaking your bones
did not satisfy you!

968
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,760
If you really like to play in a
band so much, then stop studying.

969
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,240
And start playing drums
in wedding parties.

970
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,280
Then at least your hobby
will bring in some money.

971
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,920
Now, why are you staring at me?
Eat and go to sleep. Useless!

972
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,120
And listen, she was here.
What is her name? Pooja.

973
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,680
What? Pooja was here?

974
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:49,000
Why do you need to get so
excited because of Pooja?

975
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,320
No. No, nothing like that.

976
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,000
When did she come, Father?
- I forget when she came.

977
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,920
Forget about Pooja and tell me

978
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,240
are you attending the
tuitions I paid for?

979
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,320
I will go, Father. I
will go from tomorrow.

980
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,120
Priya. - Yes.
- Did Pooja come here?

981
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,560
Yes. - Did she say something?

982
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:05,800
Yes she did. - What?

983
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,320
She said, Priya, where is my love?
Where is my Karan?

984
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,520
Now that I am here,
I must marry him.

985
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,600
Stupid, you always
joke about everything.

986
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,440
Hey, crazy lover, be careful.

987
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,080
Uncle. Uncle, was Pooja here?
Did she meet you?

988
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,560
Was Pooja here? She
did not meet me.

989
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,240
Then whom did she meet?
Father said she was here.

990
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,560
Hey, naive, you still
don't know your father.

991
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,000
He is a very shrewd man.
Extremely shrewd.

992
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,560
He took Pooja's name
to know your feelings.

993
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,640
He wanted to see the
expression on your face.

994
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,640
And you thought that he
was telling the truth.

995
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,560
Son, you get upset so easily.
Come here.

996
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,120
Come here.. Sit down.

997
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,560
Pooja did come here.

998
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,560
What?
- And she sat with me for a very long time.

999
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,640
She had snacks, drank tea. And
she was talking about you.

1000
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,320
Really, Uncle? - Yes.

1001
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,720
Yes! Yes! - Your hand!

1002
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,800
Priya, Pooja was here!

1003
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,400
My dear, sweet, innocent,
foolish brother.

1004
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,000
You have won love's semi-finals.
Now prepare for the finals.

1005
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,000
The finals. - Yes!

1006
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:10,800
"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1007
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:16,000
"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1008
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:21,040
"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1009
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:26,440
"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1010
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,640
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1011
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:36,720
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1012
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,320
"You gazed upon me and
you stole my heart!"

1013
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,240
"And took away my soul!"

1014
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:47,000
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1015
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,560
"You gazed upon me and
you stole my heart!"

1016
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,400
"And took away my soul!"

1017
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,920
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1018
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,680
"You are so beautiful
and stunning"

1019
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,160
"that the entire world
is crazy about you!"

1020
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:07,360
"My beauty is overwhelming that one
can't help to fall in love with me!"

1021
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,440
"Tell me about your own experience
and forget about the world!"

1022
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,920
"You'll know my feelings
without telling you!"

1023
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:22,000
"Oh, I am the special one!"

1024
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:27,760
"Just tell me that
you are mine."

1025
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,360
"You gazed upon me and
you stole my heart!"

1026
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,280
"And took away my soul!"

1027
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:38,000
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1028
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,000
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1029
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,160
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1030
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,360
"I don't know who has
stolen my heart?"

1031
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,360
"I have never seen one who
has stolen your heart!"

1032
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:39,520
"Why do my anklets
chime, can you tell me?"

1033
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
"Why don't you come near me I
will tell you in your ears!"

1034
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:49,080
"Don't you touch my
beautiful arms!"

1035
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,840
"So why don't you give
me your heart instead?"

1036
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,440
"You gazed upon me and
you stole my heart!"

1037
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,360
"And took away my soul!"

1038
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,840
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1039
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,680
"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1040
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,800
"I am not the one to be blamed!"

1041
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,040
"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1042
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,040
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1043
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:27,720
"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1044
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,680
Oh, dear, I think
you work too hard.

1045
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,560
Come on, why don't
you go to sleep now?

1046
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,040
Well, Uncle, I will just send
this email to my friend!

1047
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,560
Friend or a boyfriend?

1048
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:37,560
Uncle!

1049
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,640
Oh, well, I mean it is late
and your eyes look lost.

1050
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,720
I can see dreams about your
boyfriend in your eyes.

1051
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:48,440
You are absolutely wrong, Uncle.
I am a 21st century girl.

1052
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,720
I know the value of time. I am
not dreaming about boyfriends.

1053
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,320
I have more important
goals to achieve in life.

1054
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,800
Oh, I see! And may I know
what your goal is, dear?

1055
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,240
Uncle, I would like to
fulfil my father's dream.

1056
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,000
I would like to tell
the whole world

1057
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,320
about our great Indian culture.

1058
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,640
I want to get admission
in Harvard university.

1059
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,040
So that people say with pride

1060
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,720
hey, that girl is from
the Pratap family!

1061
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,920
What is the matter, Uncle?

1062
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,320
Well, you are just
like your father, Raj!

1063
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,000
He had the same confidence
and dedication!

1064
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,160
I am proud of you, dear.

1065
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,280
I mean, you are so determined
at such a tender age!

1066
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,360
I am confident that you
will fulfil Raj's dream!

1067
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,680
"Today is a special
day for me.."

1068
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,160
Hey, Karan, meet my friends!
They are from my hostel.

1069
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,160
Hi, girls! - Hi, Karan!

1070
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,160
All right! Don't you get too excited!
Relax!

1071
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,840
Karan, my friends are here
for the 'Teej' festival.

1072
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,360
Why don't you wear
something suitable?

1073
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:55,360
What will they think?

1074
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,160
This dress is perfect
for your friends.

1075
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,440
Priya, just see, you look
so beautiful in this photo!

1076
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,280
You know, the album is
full of photos like that.

1077
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,920
Is it not so, Brother?
- Yes, of course!

1078
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,680
Shall I show you some more photographs?
- Yes! Yes!

1079
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,040
'Well, she is full of
self-praise, is she not?'

1080
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,800
'I have a plan!'

1081
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,360
Look, this photograph
is from my school days.

1082
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,160
Oh, Priya, you look so smart!

1083
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,160
Girls, would you like to see

1084
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,520
another beautiful
photograph of Priya's?

1085
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,360
She is bald in that!
Bald, you know!

1086
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,440
Yes, yes, why not!

1087
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,000
No, Karan! Please don't
show that photograph!

1088
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,440
Why not? What is wrong
with the photograph?

1089
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,600
I will hit you if you
show it to them!

1090
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,600
All right, then let me show it to them.
Here it is!

1091
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,840
You.. I will get you for this!
You just wait!

1092
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,840
Try and catch me! Come on, Priya!
- Where will you run to?

1093
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,520
Catch me! - Just you wait!
- What is this spectacle?

1094
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,360
Come here! Priya, come here! What
are you two doing? - Mother!

1095
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,280
Look at him, Mother!

1096
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,520
Remember that photograph

1097
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,840
which you had taken after my
hair was shorn off! - Yes.

1098
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,000
Well, he showed
that to my friends.

1099
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,520
Everyone will tease
me about it now!

1100
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,440
Karan, why do you
always pester her?

1101
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,920
Come on, stop dancing around and
apologise to your sister! - Yes!

1102
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,280
Come on!
- Mother, did you see that?

1103
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,360
Karan! - Karan!

1104
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,080
I will get you for this!
- Catch me!

1105
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,360
I will get you for this!

1106
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,360
Karan! Come out! You teased
me in front of my friends!

1107
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:17,160
Priya! This is it!
Throwing colour on me?

1108
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,160
Who do you think you are?

1109
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,760
Hi, Pooja! - Hi, Priya!

1110
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,920
Why is he looking
like a cartoon?

1111
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,160
She has done this to me!
- Oh, very good! Very good!

1112
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,920
Welcome, dear Pooja! Welcome!

1113
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,000
God bless you!

1114
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,520
Well, I must say,
you stay in America

1115
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,320
but you have not forgotten
our Indian culture!

1116
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,080
Uncle, I am doing the
research on our culture

1117
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,840
so how can I forget it?

1118
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,360
So, I think this place is
perfect for your thesis!

1119
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,520
What is going on here?

1120
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,840
Dear, today is the
'Teej' festival!

1121
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,360
All the women and girls
adorn their hands

1122
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,600
with henna, wear bangles and
do their shopping at home.

1123
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,080
They sit on swings and
sing seasonal songs too!

1124
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,280
Wow! I also want to
participate in this.

1125
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,440
Yes, why not! Take part
and write about it too!

1126
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,000
Yes!

1127
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,360
Hey, why do you
look like a monkey?

1128
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,080
Just go and wash your face, okay!
- Oh.

1129
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,160
Come out of the cartoon channel
and re-join the family channel!

1130
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:19,160
Go! Run!

1131
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,360
Karan, I really felt good
coming to your house today.

1132
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,080
I have never been
so happy before.

1133
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,280
You know, one never gets to

1134
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,360
see this kind of love and
affection in America!

1135
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,000
It becomes difficult
to spend time there.

1136
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,640
Hey! Karan is with a girl!

1137
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,680
Oh! Buddies! I think he has her!

1138
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,920
I am sure he will take
her to a matinee show.

1139
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:04,920
So, tell me, what do you do?

1140
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,160
Well, I am supposed
to be studying now.

1141
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,000
But I don't enjoy it at all. So
my father keeps scolding me.

1142
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,440
Well, at your age, young
folks focus only on studies.

1143
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,440
So, what interests you?
- Well, I don't really know!

1144
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,880
Who are these fellows
staring at us?

1145
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,320
They are all loafers
from the neighbourhood.

1146
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,480
You know, they are
from rich families.

1147
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,760
They don't study at all
and just fool around.

1148
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:32,840
What do I tell you?

1149
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,360
I just don't pay any attention
to people like these!

1150
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,920
You are very sensible to stay
away from such company..

1151
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,160
Karan! Karan!

1152
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,800
Oh, you! You called us ruffians, goons!
- What happened?

1153
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,000
Well, the moment you see the
girl, you give her your heart

1154
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,000
and ignore us?

1155
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,320
The moment you get her
attention, you discard us?

1156
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,880
You did not even
introduce her to us?

1157
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,560
Stupid fellows! First
let me find out

1158
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:53,880
if she loves me or not!

1159
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,640
I am just a friend now.

1160
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,120
And if I introduce you to her
you will be her friends too!

1161
01:26:58,640 --> 01:26:59,880
Then there will not be any
difference between you and me!

1162
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,000
That is why I was avoiding you!

1163
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,040
Where did you disappear, Karan?

1164
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,720
Well, I had just gone
for a drink of water.

1165
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,880
For a drink?
- Pooja, tell me something.

1166
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,880
You live alone in America.
Don't you have any boyfriends?

1167
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,400
Of course! There is this
Harry, my classmate!

1168
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,240
He is a really nice fellow.

1169
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,000
He always scores more
than me in studies.

1170
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:24,160
I really like him. He
is my best friend!

1171
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,520
Hello! - Yo!
- Greetings! - Greetings!

1172
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,760
We are not loafers, we
are Karan's friends!

1173
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,760
Karan, are they your friends?
- Yes, I mean, kind of..

1174
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,600
Why are you stuttering? He
won't introduce us to you!

1175
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,160
So we will do the needful. Yo! I am Chiku!
- Chiku?

1176
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,000
I am Ronnie! I don't
want to praise myself!

1177
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,320
Sandy, why don't you tell her?

1178
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,720
Well before his birth,
his father wanted a boy

1179
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,640
and his mother
wished for a girl.

1180
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:52,800
So you know, God got perplexed.

1181
01:27:53,320 --> 01:28:00,360
So God sent him with qualities
of a boy and a girl both!

1182
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,080
Well, I am Dabbu!

1183
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:03,720
And let me tell you
something about him.

1184
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,800
Well the government couldn't
fulfil their five year plan

1185
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,360
but he managed to fulfil his!

1186
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:08,360
And how is that?

1187
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,680
Well, when we met him, he was
five years senior to us!

1188
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,360
But just for our
friendship, ma'am

1189
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,280
he waited for us in one
class for five years!

1190
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:21,840
And from that moment on,
we are all together!

1191
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,760
It is really nice to meet you.

1192
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,920
Well, you will jump with joy,
when you will hear our orchestra!

1193
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,360
Orchestra?
- Yeah, didn't Karan tell you?

1194
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,840
He is a very good guitarist!

1195
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:36,360
Karan, you are so talented. Why
did you hide this from me?

1196
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,000
So where do you guys
do your rehearsals?

1197
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,000
Right there! - There?

1198
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,360
Great!

1199
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,360
But Pooja, I don't think you
would be interested in all this?

1200
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:50,680
What do you mean?
- Well, it means that

1201
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:54,080
you are the studious
and intelligent type!

1202
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,080
Well, I am studious!
And I am intelligent!

1203
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,520
But I am not boring. - Oh..

1204
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,440
If you guys can rock
with musical instruments

1205
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:01,680
then I am a very
good dancer too!

1206
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,160
Wonderful! This is perfect!

1207
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:07,080
We need a girl for our
college function tomorrow!

1208
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,920
That is it! You will help
us, won't you, Pooja?

1209
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:13,920
I sure will! See
you on the floor!

1210
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,440
"It's not yellow, it's not blue!
It's neither black nor it's white!"

1211
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,920
"My drape is just
spic-and-span!"

1212
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,440
"It's not yellow, it's not blue!
It's neither black nor it's white!"

1213
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:05,280
"My drape is just
spic-and-span!"

1214
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,840
"My soul is moving!
And so is my body!"

1215
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:10,600
"My body is moving!
And so is my soul!"

1216
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:15,360
"If your heart really desires.."

1217
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,840
"If your heart really desires"

1218
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:22,760
"then come forward and
colour my drape!"

1219
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:30,360
"Yeah, just colour my drape!"

1220
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,840
"My soul is moving!
And so is my body!"

1221
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,600
"My body is moving!
And so is my soul!"

1222
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:40,360
"If your heart really desires.."

1223
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,920
"If your heart really desires"

1224
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:47,920
"then come forward and
colour my drape!"

1225
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:53,080
"Yeah, just colour my drape!"

1226
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,520
"It's not yellow, it's not blue!
It's neither black nor it's white!"

1227
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,520
"My drape is just
spic-and-span!"

1228
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,520
"It's not yellow, it's not blue!
It's neither black nor it's white!"

1229
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,080
"My drape is just
spic-and-span!"

1230
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,520
"It's not yellow, it's not blue!
It's neither black nor it's white!"

1231
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,160
"My drape is just
spic-and-span!"

1232
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:48,160
"People are just
crazy about me!"

1233
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:53,160
"They are ready to give
up their life for me!"

1234
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:58,160
"Be quick before someone
comes and steals my heart!"

1235
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:03,280
"But nobody has won
my heart yet."

1236
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,920
"If your heart really desires.."

1237
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,440
"If your heart really desires"

1238
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,440
"then come forward and
colour my drape!"

1239
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,440
"Yeah, just colour my drape!"

1240
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:00,680
"It's not yellow, it's not blue!
It's neither black nor it's white!"

1241
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,280
"My drape is just
spic-and-span!"

1242
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,680
"It's not yellow, it's not blue!
It's neither black nor it's white!"

1243
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,360
"My drape is just
spic-and-span!"

1244
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:13,280
"It's been years, since I had
awakened with feeling of love!"

1245
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,000
"I have guarded my heart
with lot of care!"

1246
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,520
"If you want me with
heart and soul!"

1247
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
"I welcome you with
my heart open!"

1248
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,520
"Just marry me and
take me away!"

1249
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,080
"If your heart really desires.."

1250
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,600
"If your heart really desires"

1251
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:40,520
"then come forward and
colour my drape!"

1252
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,600
"Yeah, just colour my drape!"

1253
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,160
"My soul is moving!
And so is my body!"

1254
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,840
"My body is moving!
And so is my soul!"

1255
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:55,600
"If your heart really desires.."

1256
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,160
"If your heart really desires"

1257
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:03,080
"then come forward and
colour my drape!"

1258
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:08,080
"Yeah, just colour my drape!"

1259
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,600
"My soul is moving!
And so is my body!"

1260
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:13,160
"My body is moving!
And so is my soul!"

1261
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:15,680
"My soul is moving!
And so is my body!"

1262
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,280
"My body is moving!
And so is my soul!"

1263
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,680
"My soul is moving!
And so is my body!"

1264
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,280
"My body is moving!
And so is my soul!"

1265
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,760
"My soul is moving!
And so is my body!"

1266
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:31,160
"My body is moving!
And so is my soul!"

1267
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:34,920
Well, according to your sister's
plan you have befriended Pooja!

1268
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:36,920
So when will you say, I
love you' to her? Tell me!

1269
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,280
Well, every day you
park your vehicle

1270
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,360
in front of her house, but
you never go inside! Why?

1271
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,600
Dabbu, I really have no idea.
But I feel jittery you know!

1272
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:44,640
Hey, what are you afraid of?

1273
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,440
She had come to your
house twice, right!

1274
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,160
So just tell her that I
was just around here.

1275
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,000
And so I thought I might
drop by to say hello!

1276
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,760
Well, what if she finds out
that I deliberately did this?

1277
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,600
Hey, what has happened
to you, buddy?

1278
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:59,600
Remember, you had abducted the
MLA's daughter for Chiku! - Yes.

1279
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,080
So if you can help him, then
why don't you help yourself?

1280
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,600
Now go! Be brave! Just go
inside and tell her everything!

1281
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:10,600
Come on, go!

1282
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:15,680
Oh, God! Just help him out!
I beg of you.

1283
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:20,880
Wow! Uncle, what a shot!
- That is a beauty!

1284
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,160
Hey, come on in, Karan.
How are you?

1285
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,920
I am fine.
- Harry, meet Karan! - Yes!

1286
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:27,760
This fellow put his own life in
danger to save Pooja's life!

1287
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,160
Okay! - Daring young boy!

1288
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,000
Hello. - Nice to meet you!

1289
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:37,840
Karan, Harry is soon going
to be our son-in-law!

1290
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,880
'Well, there is this Harry.
He is my classmate!'

1291
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:42,920
'He is really a nice fellow.'

1292
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:48,320
'I really like him. He
is my best friend!'

1293
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,600
Mr. Chaudhary, I think
we are really fortunate

1294
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,440
to have met people like you
- Oh, thanks a lot!

1295
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,440
Forgive us, if there has been some
mistake from our side. - Oh, no!

1296
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:59,080
Oh, here comes our most beloved son!
- Hey, where were you?

1297
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,840
Oh, come on, can't you control
yourself in front of guests?

1298
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,760
Mr. Chaudhary, this is my
younger brother, Karan!

1299
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,000
Hello! - Hello!

1300
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,160
Please come, Mr. Chaudhary!
- Yes.

1301
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,920
Come. - Okay! See you!

1302
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,360
Brother, who are these people?
- Well, they had come to see Priya!

1303
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,600
And the alliance
is confirmed too!

1304
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,600
With whom?
- He is right there! Dr. Rajesh! Him.

1305
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:18,720
Bye! Come on!

1306
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,120
'Mother, I am going
to marry a pilot!'

1307
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,080
'I mean, he must
have deep blue eyes'

1308
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,880
'be handsome, have
stylish hair!'

1309
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,480
'I guess we will have to design
such a special pilot for you'

1310
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
'on the computer!'

1311
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,720
'No, dear, we will get you
married to a doctor!'

1312
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,040
'No, Mother, I will remain
unmarried all my life'

1313
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,320
'but I will never marry a doctor!
- Why?'

1314
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,400
'I mean, he will behave like
a doctor at all times.'

1315
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:38,440
'Even when he comes home
from the hospital!'

1316
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:42,240
'But how can we
find you a pilot?'

1317
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,640
'Well, what is he there for?'

1318
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,640
'My dear, sweet, innocent, stupid brother!
He will find him for me.'

1319
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,160
Mother! Mother!

1320
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:57,160
Why are you marrying Priya to a
man who does not deserve her?

1321
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:01,360
Hey, you, he is not a nincompoop like you!
He is a doctor!

1322
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:02,760
And he makes a lot of money.

1323
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,000
Father, don't you interfere!
I am not talking to you.

1324
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,120
Priya can't be forced
to marry a man

1325
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,040
just because you have
chosen him for her!

1326
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,000
Karan, how can you say this?
- Yes, Mother, I am right!

1327
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,640
Hey, Karan, why are you
arguing like this?

1328
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:13,720
Come on over here.
- Uncle, you don't know!

1329
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,400
But I know Priya's
choice very well.

1330
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,640
So I will never let
father ruin Priya's life!

1331
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,640
Hey, Karan, why don't
you listen to me?

1332
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:24,000
Do you think we are forcing
Priya to marry him?

1333
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,120
Priya has taken
her own decision.

1334
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:27,560
What? - Yes!

1335
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:33,000
No! This can't be! Priya! Priya!

1336
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:36,400
Priya, what is all this?
Come and tell father that

1337
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,040
you are not ready for this marriage!
Come on, Priya!

1338
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,120
Are you mad?
- Yes! Because I know your choice!

1339
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:43,000
And you are taking this decision
under father's pressure!

1340
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:46,560
Come on, Priya!
- Karan, this is my own decision!

1341
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,320
Yes! This is my decision!

1342
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,920
Rajesh is my senior in college!

1343
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:57,400
For the last three years he
has been in love with me!

1344
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:58,320
And only a few days ago

1345
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,000
he managed to tell me this
with great difficulty.

1346
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,800
So what? You should
have told him

1347
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,560
that you don't love him, and
he can find someone else!

1348
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,640
If Pooja says the same thing
to you, what will you do then?

1349
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:13,400
I guess, you are even
afraid to think about it!

1350
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:16,320
Yes, even I thought that I
shouldn't break his heart

1351
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,440
and agreed to marry him!

1352
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,880
So it means that, just
for his happiness

1353
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:22,760
you are ready to
sacrifice your own life?

1354
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,120
No, it is not a sacrifice!

1355
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,440
I felt love for him when I saw
that he adores me so much!

1356
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,440
And looks don't matter!

1357
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:35,680
I know that he will keep me happy!
And I will be happy with him too!

1358
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,920
Hey, why are you so upset?

1359
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,000
I know. Because your sister
won't be here, right?

1360
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,440
Don't worry.

1361
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,440
When I leave after marriage, Pooja
will come here after marrying you!

1362
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,440
Son, I am not really
getting this.

1363
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,680
Why are you leaving for Mumbai
when your leave is not over yet?

1364
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,000
Mother, you don't understand!

1365
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,520
If I go earlier this time

1366
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
then I will get extra leave
during Priya's wedding!

1367
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:05,680
Mother, why are you
giving me this pickle?

1368
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,280
You get everything there!

1369
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:13,080
Brother, I would also like to
come to Mumbai with you tomorrow.

1370
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,360
Why? What don't you
have over here?

1371
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,600
No, it is nothing. But I don't
want to live in this city.

1372
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,320
Thank God! Finally
he realised this!

1373
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,560
Pankaj, take him with you.

1374
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,240
Father, don't take
him so seriously!

1375
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,000
Hey, everyone from this house
has done well in studies!

1376
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:31,120
Will you at least get
your degree or not?

1377
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:35,320
Do you think it is a great
achievement to get a degree?

1378
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:39,320
Well, I say, go and book
his ticket tonight itself.

1379
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,560
Hi, Karan! - Oh, hi!

1380
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,320
Well, uncle told me
that you had come home?

1381
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:56,400
And when I called Priya, she told
me that you are going to Mumbai?

1382
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:57,320
Is there anything special?

1383
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:58,720
I mean how come you
suddenly decided to go?

1384
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,240
No! Nothing special.

1385
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:03,040
I mean, for how long can
I take father's taunts?

1386
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:06,440
He has to face a lot of
trouble because of me.

1387
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:09,240
Well, you tell me, so
when is the wedding day?

1388
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,800
No, you tell me first.
You met Harry, right?

1389
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:16,000
So how did you find him?
- He is very nice!

1390
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,840
Honestly, Karan, I really
feel that anyone will be

1391
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,920
fortunate to have
a man like Harry!

1392
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,000
I can't really tell
you how nice he is!

1393
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,760
I had introduced him to uncle

1394
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,760
when he came for the
first time to India.

1395
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,800
And that was when
he fell in love!

1396
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,000
And you know what? Uncle was
not ready for the marriage!

1397
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,160
But I didn't budge and told him

1398
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:39,360
that the wedding will be
possible only with Harry!

1399
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,520
Karan, can you imagine
how lucky Simmi is?

1400
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,760
Simmi? - Yes, Simmi! She is
getting married to Harry.

1401
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,760
Simmi?
- Well, why are you so surprised?

1402
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,360
You talk as if you
don't know Simmi!

1403
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:56,520
No! No! I do, I mean,
I know her very well!

1404
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,520
Wait a minute! Just one minute.

1405
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:05,840
Just one minute, I will be back!

1406
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,160
Yes!

1407
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,920
Oh, man, God is great! Yes!

1408
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,920
Karan!

1409
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:14,600
Karan!

1410
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,360
Karan! It is time for
the train, where are..

1411
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,680
Oh, Pooja, you and here?
- Hello!

1412
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,000
Hello!
- Brother, one minute! - What?

1413
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,920
Pooja, just a minute!
- What is it?

1414
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:27,680
Brother, I am not going to Mumbai!
- What? But why not?

1415
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:31,080
If I go to Mumbai, my
studies will get affected.

1416
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,080
You guys studied as much as you wanted.
Why shouldn't I then?

1417
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,160
Oh, I see! Father was
absolutely right!

1418
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:39,280
He said that you can change
your mind at any time.

1419
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,920
I stood in the queue
for six hours

1420
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,080
to get your tickets!
And now you don't..

1421
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,520
I am going now! Bye, Pooja!

1422
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,520
Bye! - Brother! - What is it?

1423
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
You know what, my
pocket money is over.

1424
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,360
So why don't you leave Rs.
2,000 with mother?

1425
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,080
Oh, I see!

1426
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,160
Fine! - Okay, Brother, see you!

1427
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:00,160
Come on, Karan!

1428
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:05,440
Karan, will you call me
when you reach Mumbai?

1429
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,360
Mumbai? Who is going to Mumbai?

1430
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,360
You? - Well, I am not going to Mumbai!
- Why?

1431
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,080
Well, brother was
getting worried.

1432
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:16,760
He said I am a kid now. There is
still time for me to start working!

1433
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,080
First complete your studies,
and then you can get a job.

1434
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,920
So what have you decided?

1435
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:23,640
I thought the same.

1436
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:28,280
You know, Pooja, I must
concentrate on my studies now!

1437
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:32,840
Very good! Very good!

1438
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,520
Karan, where are your friends?
I can't see them around!

1439
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,360
Today is Sunday, so everyone
has gone to the disco!

1440
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,280
And you are not going?

1441
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:43,760
Well, don't you know one needs
a partner to go to the disco?

1442
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,920
And I don't have a partner.

1443
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:50,240
You really want to go to the disco?
- Yes!

1444
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,800
Okay then get to my place by 6 p.m.
in the evening tomorrow.

1445
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:57,800
I will be your partner for the disco.
- Yes!

1446
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,240
"O' dear God!"

1447
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,800
"O' dear God!"

1448
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,400
"O' dear God!"

1449
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:25,320
"O' dear God!"

1450
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:29,320
"O' dear God!"

1451
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:45,240
"What should I call this
love, this passion?"

1452
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:50,240
"O' dear God! O' dear God!"

1453
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:56,240
"What should I call this
love, this passion?"

1454
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,000
"O' dear God!"

1455
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:05,400
"How can I appease
my restless mind?"

1456
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:12,320
"How can I appease
my restless mind?"

1457
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,400
"What should I call this
love, this passion?"

1458
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,400
"O' dear God! O' dear God!"

1459
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:14,880
"O' dear God! O' dear God!"

1460
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:22,240
"I feel lonely and passionate
just because of you."

1461
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:29,480
"All I can think is of is you."

1462
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:36,800
"O' dear God! O' dear God!"

1463
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:44,120
"I really feel helpless because
I can't tell you my feelings!"

1464
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:51,480
"You are close to my heart
and yet you're so far away!"

1465
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:58,800
"My silence is not enough
to convey my feelings!"

1466
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:05,720
"How can I appease
my restless mind?"

1467
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:09,880
"What should I call this
love, this passion?"

1468
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,000
"O' dear God!"

1469
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:17,040
"What should I call this
love, this passion?"

1470
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:21,040
"O' dear God!"

1471
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:57,400
"How can I appease
my restless mind?"

1472
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:04,640
"O' dear God! O' dear God!"

1473
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:11,880
"My love for you has now
crossed all the limits!"

1474
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:19,400
"You have no idea, how
much I love you.."

1475
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:26,640
"O' dear God! O' dear God!"

1476
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:34,000
"I have become so
engrossed in you"

1477
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:41,320
"that I can hear your
heart's desires!"

1478
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:45,240
"And I don't know how to
satisfy that desire!"

1479
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:48,560
"O' dear God!"

1480
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:52,560
"How can I appease
my restless mind?"

1481
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,160
What! Wow, my parcel has come.

1482
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,840
Hey, have patience. First tell
me, what is there in this?

1483
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,080
Postcards! Only postcards.

1484
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,920
Postcards! Okay then I will
give them to your father

1485
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:16,920
he can use them
to write letters.

1486
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,600
No, Uncle, please
don't give it to him.

1487
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,160
Then tell me first, what
is there inside this?

1488
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:22,000
I will tell you!
First give it to me.

1489
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:26,000
Shall I give it?
- Please, Uncle! - So take it!

1490
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:31,600
Hey, these are so many
pieces of card board!

1491
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:33,920
Have you decided to leave your
studies and become a scrap dealer?

1492
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,280
No, Uncle, there is a beautiful
picture in these cards.

1493
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,440
What do you mean?

1494
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,600
Actually, tomorrow
is Pooja's birthday.

1495
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:42,760
I want to gift her this and
without saying anything verbally

1496
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,080
I will express my love to her.

1497
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,080
How? - I will show
you right now.

1498
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:25,640
Wow!

1499
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:29,560
So, Uncle, isn't my love getting
expressed through this?

1500
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,400
Who made this design, son?
- One of my friends.

1501
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,000
Your friend is a fool. - Why?

1502
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:38,880
Son, you can put all this together,
but if you give this to Pooja

1503
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,400
she will make a
mess of her face.

1504
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,880
These are all old tricks!
Be a modern lover! Modern!

1505
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:48,120
Have you seen that movie 'Darr'?
- Yes.

1506
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:49,880
In that, actor Shah Rukh
Khan had written the name of

1507
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,320
his beloved on his
chest, K-Kiran!

1508
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:58,880
Think something like that.
Think son, think!

1509
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:02,880
Idea!

1510
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:18,080
Hi, Karan!
- Oh, hi, Pooja! Happy birthday to you.

1511
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:20,440
Hey, what is all this? Suit,
shoes and sun shades..

1512
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,080
Today you are looking
like a hero.

1513
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:23,720
Hey, it is all because it
is your birthday today.

1514
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:25,000
Yes, it is!

1515
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,920
Pooja, I was thinking that you
belong to a very rich family.

1516
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:29,720
I was expecting a very big
party and lots of people

1517
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,120
song and dance, just like
the way it is in films.

1518
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:34,360
But there is nothing
happening over here.

1519
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:38,680
Karan, come on. Come,
Karan, come in.

1520
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:42,240
Look at this, it is for you.
For our friendship.

1521
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,920
Hey, what is this? It
is me who should be

1522
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:45,400
giving you something today.

1523
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,560
Doesn't make any difference.

1524
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,640
No! No! Don't open it.
Go home and open it.

1525
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:52,400
I won't like it. - Okay!

1526
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,320
Yes, where is my birthday gift?
I am not going to leave it.

1527
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,640
Hold on, hold on. Here it is.
- Wow!

1528
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:03,640
Open and see it, I will like it.
- Okay.

1529
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,800
Oh, how nice!

1530
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:14,000
Something special?

1531
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,280
See it properly. There is
something special in it.

1532
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:20,280
Really?

1533
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:27,760
Karan, you..

1534
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,320
I have written it with my blood.

1535
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:33,440
What! What a silly joke! How disgusting!
Are you mad?

1536
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:36,040
Have you gone crazy?
I had never imagined

1537
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:37,360
that you would do
such a stupid thing.

1538
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:42,040
Why do you upset me, Karan?

1539
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:46,040
Why!

1540
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:52,080
Karan, I don't like all this.

1541
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:56,080
I don't like all this!

1542
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:15,800
Karan, you have gone crazy..
Buddy, she is very different.

1543
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,640
Her sensitivity and sensibility
everything is different, Karan!

1544
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:22,320
These Hindi film gimmicks, don't
make any difference to her, buddy.

1545
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,240
Thank God he had only
written happy birthday.

1546
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:25,720
If he had written
I love you then..

1547
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,240
Then she would have kicked
him out of the house.

1548
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:31,800
My dear, I have told
you so many times

1549
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:35,320
that don't fall in love
with an A-category girl.

1550
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,240
Hey, what is this?
- Pooja had gifted this to me.

1551
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,040
Oh! She must have gifted you
this for getting angry with you.

1552
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:42,560
Hey, bring it here! Open it.
- Open it. - Open it. Open it!

1553
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,000
What is inside this? - Come on!

1554
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:48,000
Hey, Karan, a trumpet!

1555
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:52,000
There is a letter
also along with it.

1556
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:56,800
'My dear Karan, I can
never forget you.'

1557
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,520
'Because I owe my life to you.'

1558
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,560
'You have such a beautiful
heart that cares for others.'

1559
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:08,320
'Karan, I know that you
are a very good musician'

1560
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,600
'but you are not
concentrating fully on it.'

1561
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,480
'You have to become a
big musician in life'

1562
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,680
'because every
person has a goal.'

1563
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:24,880
'This gift of mine will always
make you remember your goal.'

1564
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,880
Now do you get why she
was angry with you

1565
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,240
and why she scolded you?

1566
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,040
Buddy, if she can think about
you till such an extent

1567
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,320
then you can imagine how
much she must be loving you!

1568
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,280
Now don't waste time, go and
tell her, 'I love you'.

1569
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,800
Why are you getting scared?
Be brave, Karan.

1570
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:37,880
By writing this letter to you

1571
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,680
she has given you the
green signal, my dear.

1572
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:41,280
Yes. - Karan, all systems
indicate a go-ahead.

1573
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,600
Get on with your love story, be patient.
- Come on!

1574
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:47,600
Go to her and tell her, 'I love you'.
Go, Karan.

1575
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:15,800
Hey, you scoundrel!

1576
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,480
Where are you rushing
to on your bike?

1577
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,640
Can't you see that we
have blocked the road?

1578
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:23,880
Are you going to attend somebody's
marriage with this trumpet?

1579
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,320
Hey..

1580
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,040
He is getting angry as though his
beloved has gifted it to him.

1581
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,720
Here take it, sir!

1582
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:32,640
With love from Pooja!

1583
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:36,640
Oh! Pooja! Pooja!

1584
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,920
Oh, my God!

1585
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,760
Getting angry for
such a small thing!

1586
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,760
No!

1587
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:26,000
Pooja, whose letter is it?
- Simmi! Simmi!

1588
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:27,400
Oh, my God!

1589
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:30,080
Oh, my God! You have got
admission in Harvard University.

1590
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:33,440
Congratulations! I will go
and call up father, okay!

1591
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,320
Yes, call him up but
don't tell him.

1592
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,720
I want to give him a surprise.
- Okay!

1593
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:38,640
Hi, Pooja!

1594
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:41,120
Karan, what timing! You have
come at the right time.

1595
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,680
As soon as I got the good
news, you have arrived.

1596
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,720
I have got admission
in Harvard University.

1597
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,880
I am going back to America.

1598
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,000
Oh! - Do you know, Karan

1599
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,360
I was waiting so eagerly
for this day to come.

1600
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,880
I had been studying day
and night for this day.

1601
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:02,560
Today I am very happy! I can see
my destination very clearly.

1602
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,800
Hey how did you get this wound?

1603
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:07,880
Oh! It is because I met
with a small accident.

1604
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,440
It will heal.

1605
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:14,280
Karan, I hope you are not angry
with me because of yesterday.

1606
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:17,440
See it was your fault!
Don't do it again, okay?

1607
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:20,640
Okay. - My dear, congratulations!
- Uncle!

1608
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:22,040
I have got admission
in Harvard University.

1609
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,720
Wow, that is lovely!
- I am going back to America!

1610
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:28,720
Let us dance and shout!

1611
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:46,840
Greetings, welcome! Welcome!
- Hello!

1612
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,840
Hey, not to me, go and
give it over there.

1613
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,120
Hello.

1614
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:54,640
Hello - What are you doing?

1615
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:58,640
Hey, please..

1616
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:13,720
What! Go and speak to her.

1617
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:18,240
Welcome!
- Congratulations! Congratulations!

1618
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:22,240
Hi, Karan!
- Hi, Pooja! How are you?

1619
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:28,120
Hello, sir. - Pooja!
- Hi, how are you?

1620
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:31,720
Congratulations! - Thanks.

1621
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:34,120
Congratulations. - Thank you.

1622
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,560
Now congratulate me.

1623
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,040
For what?
- First congratulate me.

1624
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:38,640
But why?

1625
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:41,120
I have got admission
in Harvard University.

1626
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:45,120
I am going to America.

1627
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:50,320
Karan, Priya is calling you.

1628
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,880
Priya! What is the matter,
why have you called me here?

1629
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:54,640
Karan, Pooja is going
back to America.

1630
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:58,040
Oh! So you have called me
to tell me this? Come.

1631
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,720
You are taking it so easy as
though nothing has happened.

1632
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:05,320
Oh, come on now. In any
case she had to go back.

1633
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:08,480
Has Pooja refused?

1634
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,240
No.

1635
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:15,000
Did you tell her that
you love her or not?

1636
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:16,240
So I will go and tell
Pooja right now.

1637
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:19,040
No, Priya, please!

1638
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:23,320
And you had told me to be
friends with her first

1639
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,880
and after becoming Pooja's
friend, I came to know

1640
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,880
that it was one-sided love.

1641
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:36,080
Priya. Pooja is so excited
about going to Harvard

1642
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:41,520
that I don't want to hurt her
by expressing my love to her.

1643
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,440
I believe that she
will be more happy

1644
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,640
with her choice of life
rather than my love for her.

1645
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:49,000
If you wanted to be her
friend then why did you

1646
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,000
follow her like a mad
man all these days?

1647
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,680
Do you know, Priya, what is
the meaning of true love?

1648
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:58,640
To see your beloved happy.

1649
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:02,040
And Pooja is my true love.

1650
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:06,440
I want to always see Pooja happy.
- By hurting yourself!

1651
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:10,040
Certainly! I would never want

1652
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:13,080
Pooja to know about
my love for her.

1653
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:17,080
I know that you will also
not tell her anything.

1654
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:25,920
Promise!

1655
02:00:26,440 --> 02:00:27,080
Hey, Pankaj, come here.

1656
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:28,760
Yes, Uncle.
- Go and tell them inside

1657
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:30,920
that it is time for the
farewell ceremony, be fast.

1658
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,440
Okay.
- And I am going to Priya's in-laws' place

1659
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:35,520
along with the truck to
drop all the baggage.

1660
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,600
Okay, Uncle. - Hey, you fools,
have you kept all the baggage?

1661
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:40,320
Yes, we have counted
and kept everything.

1662
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,320
Well done! Well done! Very good!

1663
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:54,080
God bless you, my dear.
Be happy.

1664
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:56,680
Mother, will you
come to meet me?

1665
02:00:57,160 --> 02:01:00,600
What are you saying, dear?
How can we forget you?

1666
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,680
Where is Karan? Where is Karan?

1667
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:03,760
Dear, he must be
somewhere around

1668
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:05,600
stop worrying about him, it
is getting late, you go.

1669
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:07,280
How can I leave
without meeting him?

1670
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:08,160
But, dear.. - Karan!

1671
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:09,680
Where are you going, Priya? Priya!
- Everybody is waiting for you!

1672
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:10,920
Karan!

1673
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:14,920
Karan!

1674
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,520
Karan!

1675
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:24,800
Karan..

1676
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:27,160
What are you doing over here?

1677
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:31,160
Priya, you are also leaving me?

1678
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,480
Karan! - Priya!

1679
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,320
Why is all this happening?

1680
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,640
Why is it happening
with my brother?

1681
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:43,440
Priya! Priya!

1682
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:47,000
If I had known earlier that all
this is going to happen with you

1683
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,680
then I would have told you

1684
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:52,280
to go and express your love
to Pooja that very same day.

1685
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:55,400
I wouldn't have told
you to befriend her.

1686
02:01:55,880 --> 02:01:58,600
Your state is because of me!

1687
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:02,040
Why did I stop you?
Why did I stop you!

1688
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:05,800
No, Priya! No! Don't say that.

1689
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:07,480
You have not done anything.

1690
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,480
Priya, what had to happen has happened.
It is my luck, Priya.

1691
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,480
Don't cry, Priya,
don't cry for me.

1692
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:42,360
I am sorry, Priya, I got late.

1693
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:46,360
Wish you a very
happy married life.

1694
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:56,040
Thank you. - Come, dear.

1695
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:04,440
Priya, take care of yourself.

1696
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:17,560
Father, Pooja has come
to take your blessings

1697
02:03:18,040 --> 02:03:18,560
as she is going to America.

1698
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,080
Oh!

1699
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:24,320
Be happy. God bless you, dear.

1700
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:27,160
God bless you, dear. God bless.
- Where is sir?

1701
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:29,080
He has gone to Priya's
in-laws' house to drop her.

1702
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:32,400
He will come back tomorrow.

1703
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:35,840
Don't worry, I will tell him.

1704
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,880
Okay, sir. - All the best, dear.
- I will make a move.

1705
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,280
Okay, Karan, I will get going.

1706
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:44,000
Don't forget, the flight is
at ten tomorrow morning.

1707
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:48,000
Bye! - Bye.

1708
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,400
Son! Karan!

1709
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:03,640
Father! - My son!

1710
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:06,080
Karan. - Father!

1711
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:11,760
No, my son. No, my dear, no.

1712
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:15,760
I am proud of you.

1713
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,080
Pooja! Pooja! Where
are you lost?

1714
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,680
Akash, will you
take care of uncle?

1715
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:26,440
Of course, Pooja,
you don't worry.

1716
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,360
My dear, what
mistake have I made

1717
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:30,440
that you have asked me not
to come to the airport?

1718
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:32,000
I didn't like it, dear.

1719
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:36,360
Uncle, it is because you can send
me from here by encouraging me.

1720
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,520
What will happen if
you are not able

1721
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,280
to control yourself over there?

1722
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:45,600
I won't be able to control myself
if I see tears in your eyes, Uncle.

1723
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:49,680
Then maybe I won't be able to go.
- Oh, it is fine!

1724
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:52,000
I am very brave.

1725
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:57,520
I am not so weak, dear, as
you are imagining be to be.

1726
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,520
Come on.

1727
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:09,280
Take care, Uncle.

1728
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,040
You also take care, dear.

1729
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:14,760
You are going for a
very good cause.

1730
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,920
I want that when you complete
your studies and come back

1731
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,120
your studies and your
research should be

1732
02:05:19,640 --> 02:05:22,600
beneficial for our country.

1733
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:24,000
Okay, Simmi.

1734
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:28,160
Pooja! Pooja, don't go.

1735
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:32,280
Crazy girl, will you send off
your sister crying like this?

1736
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:36,280
You are making us cry
and then leaving.

1737
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:44,280
That fool decided not
to express his love

1738
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:45,760
and you all didn't say anything!

1739
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:48,920
What could we do? He had
told us not to say anything.

1740
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:52,280
I will see how he stops me!

1741
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:55,760
Brother, come on!
- Now where are you going?

1742
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:57,800
My son's beloved is going away and
I shall watch everything silently?

1743
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,280
I will go and stop her.

1744
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:03,280
Even if I have to bow
in front of Pooja.

1745
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,360
Hey, you Romeo, from
the ancient era!

1746
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:15,160
You still have time, before
the flight takes off.

1747
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:16,600
You also check in, buddy.

1748
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:19,280
I mean, go and tell her
that you love her.

1749
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:21,320
And if you don't have the courage
then we will go and tell her.

1750
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:25,640
Yes! - Come on! Dare any of you
go and say anything to Pooja.

1751
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:27,680
I think she has
heard everything.

1752
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:30,840
I pray to God she has
heard everything.

1753
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:33,520
Coffee

1754
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,720
Here. - Thanks.

1755
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:38,680
What are you thinking, Pooja?

1756
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:41,000
I am thinking that I refused
all my family members

1757
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,760
and even uncle to
come to the airport

1758
02:07:44,280 --> 02:07:46,440
but I didn't refuse you.
Why is that?

1759
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:49,720
Very simple. It is because
they all are attached to you.

1760
02:07:50,240 --> 02:07:51,520
And it pains a lot to
separate from the one

1761
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,840
who is attached to you.

1762
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:57,280
And us? We are just
acquaintances.

1763
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:01,760
And it doesn't hurt when
separating from such people.

1764
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:04,680
Right? - Right.

1765
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:09,240
You have learnt to
talk a lot these days.

1766
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:12,080
Krishna, put the motorcycle
on the stand and come fast.

1767
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,440
Okay. - Come on. Come on.

1768
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:15,880
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

1769
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:17,680
I am going inside.
- Where is your ticket?

1770
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:20,440
My brother is getting the ticket.
- You can't enter without a ticket.

1771
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,760
My brother is getting the ticket,
I won't go in without a ticket.

1772
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:23,920
Security, get him.
Take him away.

1773
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:26,520
I am a retired captain. Listen to me.
- Get out.

1774
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,840
Pooja's flight will take off.
Allow me to go in. - Come on.

1775
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:34,000
Karan, Chiku is crying a lot,
we will have to handle him.

1776
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:36,000
What happened?
- No. No. Nothing.

1777
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:37,640
I will be right back.

1778
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:38,560
Chiku, what are you doing?
- He doesn't understand..

1779
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:39,120
Control yourself.

1780
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:41,560
Karan, he wants to tell
everything to Pooja.

1781
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:42,880
I have told you all
so many times that

1782
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:44,320
no one will tell Pooja anything.

1783
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,640
But you still don't
get it, do you?

1784
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:47,880
Why don't you want
to tell her, buddy?

1785
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:49,720
Karan, she is your life support.

1786
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:52,160
How will you live
without the support?

1787
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:55,640
Karan, we are your friends, we can't
see you leading a suffocating life.

1788
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:57,480
You can stop me as
much as you can, Karan

1789
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:58,720
but I will tell her
everything today.

1790
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:01,040
Chiku - Stop, Chiku.
Have you gone mad?

1791
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,720
You will see me dead if you take
even a single step forward.

1792
02:09:04,240 --> 02:09:06,120
Karan..

1793
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:08,600
Karan, Pooja is coming here.

1794
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:11,080
Say it, Karan.

1795
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:12,880
Pooja is coming,
wipe your tears.

1796
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,120
Say it, Karan. - Wipe them fast.

1797
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:17,240
What is wrong with Chiku?
Why is he crying?

1798
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:20,320
No, it's because
you are leaving.

1799
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:24,000
Yes. Yes.
- Oh, Chiku, how sweet.

1800
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,720
Pooja, would you mind
if I say something?

1801
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:29,640
Oh, God. - Yes, say it.

1802
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:32,400
You won't forget us after
going there, will you?

1803
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:36,400
How can I forget, you
all are Karan's friend.

1804
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:40,440
I will cherish each moment
spent with you all.

1805
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:44,720
Hey, I forgot your autographs.

1806
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:48,720
Autograph please.

1807
02:10:05,240 --> 02:10:06,760
Thank you.

1808
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:10,440
Now won't you give me one?
- Why? What have I done now?

1809
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:15,360
Sometimes even the doer
isn't aware of his deeds.

1810
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:19,360
Please.

1811
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:30,320
Pooja

1812
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,440
what happened?

1813
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:36,480
Karan, I don't know why

1814
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,360
but I feel as if I am
leaving something behind.

1815
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,920
I have a strange feeling.

1816
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:45,280
As the time for my
departure is coming closer

1817
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:46,080
I feel as if

1818
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:47,360
something is going away from me.
- 'Air India flight number'

1819
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,440
'753 to New York is
ready for boarding.'

1820
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:53,440
'Passengers are requested to proceed
towards the security check.'

1821
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:56,160
Okay, Karan, I will make a move.

1822
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:00,160
Okay. Bye, Pooja. Take care.

1823
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,440
Karan!

1824
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:42,360
Pooja!

1825
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:45,840
What happened, Pooja?

1826
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:53,440
I remembered, what
I was missing.

1827
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:59,800
And even you know
what I was missing.

1828
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:03,520
You do, don't you?

1829
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,520
You love me a lot, don't you?

1830
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,600
I love you, Karan.

1831
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:21,600
I love you, Pooja. - I love you.

1832
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:32,600
Go, Pooja. Your flight
has been announced.

1833
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:39,560
No, Karan, I will stay here. Now, I
won't leave you and go anywhere.

1834
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:45,440
No, Pooja, you will have to go.

1835
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:50,640
Did you hear that?
You will have to go!

1836
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:53,560
We can unite later.

1837
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:55,920
But the opportunity
that you have got today

1838
02:12:56,440 --> 02:12:59,040
you will never get
the same again.

1839
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:05,760
And then you had said that everyone
should have an aim in life.

1840
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:10,040
Today, because of you,
I have an aim in life.

1841
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:14,400
Forget waiting for
days, months or years

1842
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,880
I can wait several
lifetimes for you.

1843
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:17,840
Karan.

1844
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:21,400
'Calling Ms. Pooja Saxena.
Ms. Pooja Saxena.'

1845
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:25,120
'Passenger travelling by Air India
flight number 753 to New York'

1846
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:26,560
'is requested to board the
aircraft immediately.'

1847
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:32,640
Go, Pooja.. Our love will
help us achieve our goals.

1848
02:13:33,120 --> 02:13:36,640
Bye. - Bye.

1849
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,680
Come here, son. Come here.

1850
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:51,440
Yes! - Very good. Very good.
- Uncle.

1851
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:53,520
Father.
- Bless you, my son. Bless you.

1852
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,520
Good that she initiated it
or else, you are so naive

1853
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,840
that you wouldn't have confessed
your love all your life.

1854
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:02,840
He is still naive that is why
he does everything wrong.

1855
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:05,280
But this thing that
he did was very good.

1856
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:08,000
Whose son is he after all!
- Wonderful, dear!

1857
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,160
Now that he has done something
good you claim to be his father.

1858
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:11,440
And if he does
something wrong then..

1859
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,800
Then it is because he is
your nephew after all!

1860
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:18,680
{\an8}"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1861
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:23,760
{\an8}"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1862
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:28,840
{\an8}"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1863
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:34,320
{\an8}"Your eyes really enchanted me."

1864
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:39,560
{\an8}"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1865
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:44,600
{\an8}"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1866
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:47,280
{\an8}"You gazed upon me
and you stole my heart!"

1867
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,160
{\an8}"And took away my soul!"

1868
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:54,920
{\an8}"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"

1869
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:57,600
{\an8}"You gazed upon me
and you stole my heart!"

1870
02:14:58,080 --> 02:14:59,520
{\an8}"And took away my soul!"

1871
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:05,280
{\an8}"I am not the one to be blamed!
You had fallen for my beauty!"
